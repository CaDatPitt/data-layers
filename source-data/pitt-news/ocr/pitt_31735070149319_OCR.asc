ROTC
weighs in
on coed
front lines

Natalie Daher
Staﬁ“ Writer

Laws of the military have pro-
gressed along way since the days

Molly “Pitcher” Ludwig fetched

some water for the boys in the
Revolutionary War. Women’s roles
in combat later expanded as thou-
sands were deployed asnurses for
the Second World War.

Now, a month into 2013, wom-
enare legally permitted to operate
artillery on the front lines of the
battleﬁeld.

On Jan. 23, outgoing Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta lifted the
1994 Pentagon prohibition on
women serving in direct combat
positions. Before this develop-
ment, women were allowed to
work in many branches of the
military, including intelligence,
ﬁnance and communications, but
they were denied access to infan-
try and tank divisions, among
others.

The historical change has Pitt
students and faculty debating
whether women on the front lines
represent a positive or negative
development for the U.S. military.

Rich Trotter, a current third-
year ROTC cadet anticipating join-
ing the Army, believes that women
might not be physically up for the
challenge.

“I believe in complete equal
rights, but I think when it comes
down to it, it’s a matter of who
could pull their weight,” he said.

Pitt Men’s Glee Club prepares for group tour in Europe

Lauren Bauschard
Staﬁ . .Wrz'ter

After two years of waiting, mem-
bers of the Pitt Men’s Glee Club
will have their passports stamped
in Europe this spring.

Seventy members of the group
will tour in Belgium, the Neth-
erlands and France as a part of
a two—week international tour
beginning April 29.

Richard Teaster, music direc-

tor of the Pitt Men’s Glee Club,
has been planning the trip since
the group’s last excursion in May
2010, when members toured in
Italy and'Croatia and took part
in a prestigious concert series at
the University of Bologna.
According to Teaster, the Stu-
dent Government Board budget
cuts in the late 1970s ended the
club’s tradition of touring in Eu-
rope. The club did not reinstate
its international tour until 2007

when members traveled to Hun-
gary, Austria and the Czech Re-
public.

Teaster explained that the en-
tire club is invited to make the
journey, and it tries to seek fund-
ing to help members who might be
experiencing ﬁnancial hardships.
The trip costs $3,100 per student.

“[The Dietrich School of] Arts
and Sciences has contributed
some smaller scholarships for
freshmen, but we do not get much

funding from the school,” Teaster
said. “The biggest difficulty is get-
ting all the money together for the
airfare, buses, hotels, etc. It’s a
big undertaking, and we do a lot
of fundraising.” '

Victor Bench, the club’s vice
president, said fundraising events
included a pancake dinner, chili
cook-off and various concerts
around the city.

Corrections: Onjan. 17, 2013, The Pitt News published a ﬁlm review of “Zero Dark Thirty” that reported that the ﬁlm “is about the war on terror, and is meant to inform, not to

entertain.” The ﬁlm was not historically accurate, but a dramatization of the events following Sept. 11. The Pitt News regrets the error.

In Thursday’s article, “Pitt Law dean speaks on future of affirmative action,” Pitt Law School Dean William M. CarterJr., who was not speaking on behalf of the Law School, was
quoted as saying the U.S. has an “equal protection clause, not equal treatment.” The quote should read, “equal protection clause, not an equal treatment clause.” Also, it should be
clariﬁed that higher education would be impacted if the Supreme Court no longer allowed race as a factor in the admissions process. The Pitt News regrets the error.

portive social and ﬁnancial infrastructure
maintained entirely by the student mem-
bers, most of us will be going to Europe,”
Bench said.

Teaster said the group is currently com-
posed of 79 members, of which 70 members
plan to attend the tour. He emphasized that
he did not want members to be discouraged
from going just because money is tight.

Many members have never traveled
abroad before, according to Teaster, so
many of them will face the challenge of
language barriers, as well as mundane tasks
such as obtaining passports.

As for the language barrier, Teaster
says that a few of the students are ﬂuent
in German, Italian or French. But he said
he believes Dutch will present more of a
challenge. According to Teaster, in the past,
the language barrier hasn’t been much of a

problem, and he doesn’t think it will cause _g
difficulties on this trip either. He added that

their travel company has tour guides with
them at all times who speak the language.

Bench, who has never been out of the
United States before, said he is not in the
least bit nervous, but rather, thrilled for
the upcoming travel experience.

“I can’t think about it too much because
I shake with excitement at the thought of
strutting down sunny alleys, rolling deep
with 79 distinguished singers, wearing tux-
edos and dripping with Pitt pride,” Bench
said.

Teaster shared an anecdote from a past
trip during which a student left his pass-
port behind at the hotel. Teaster picked

up the passport himself but decided not
to tell the student until he was required
to present it upon crossing the border of
another country.

“He was sweating a little by then,”
Teaster said.

While the club is abroad, members will
visit a variety of famous historical sites, in-

cluding the Stella Artois Brewery in Louvain
and Versailles, the Louvre and the Eiffel
Tower in Paris. The club also plans to visit
the Delft Pottery Factory and the Van Gogh
Museum in the Netherlands.

Glee Club member Tyler Kirkland said
the two most exciting aspects of this tour

are the opportunity to perform at the Notre

Dame Cathedral in Paris and in collabora-
tion with the Arenberg Orkest, a student
orchestra at the University of Louvain in
Belgium.

According to Bench, the Pitt Men’s Glee
Club submitted a repertoire list as well as

According to Pitt Law professor _].R.
Frakt, the recent allowance of women into
infantry units will increase‘women’s mobil-
ity in their careers and support the likeli-
hood of their advancement to higher ranks.
Currently, 16 percent of women make up
the officer corps

Frakt said the delay of the integration
process was a result of age-old stereotypes
about women in the U.S.

“I think it had to do with an old-fash-
ioned view of the need to protect women
and that Americans wouldn’t accept if
women and their daughters were being
killed or sent off to ﬁght,” he said. “And also
the perception that women couldn’t cut it

ly, Frakt said,
the experience of women in war over the
last decade has shown that women are very
capable soldiers, adding that they have
already gained combat positions in the
Air Force. _

“There has been a blurring of lines in
recent years where many women found
themselves in positions where they could
potentially come in contact with the enemy
and could ﬁnd themselves in a hostile ﬁre-
ﬁght,” he said. -

Additionally, Frakt noted that Panetta
was not without outside motivation to
change the military policy on gender. First,
Panetta made this change to institute equal—
ity based on the recommendation of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Also, last November,
the American Civil Liberties Union ﬁled
a federal lawsuit on behalf of four female
militarybﬁicers and the Service Women’s
Action Network — a group that works for
equality in the military —— that challenged
the discrimination against women and
questioned whether there was a sound legal

' and actual basis for the previous policies.

Frakt believes that, for Panetta, it was
not worth defending-in court, especially
in light of the combat andcombat-support
roles of women in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“I think this is a highly popular decision
—— it’s a decision with widespread support
within the military,” Frakt said. “It would
require a majority of both houses in Con-
gress to override it, and the votes are not

‘there to do something like that.”

Other ROTC members, including some
female cadets, are still skeptical about the
enhanced roles of women in the military.

Kristen Stoler, a third—year Air Force
ROTC cadet, holds a viewpoint similar to
Trotter’s regarding the biological inferior-
ity of women as ﬁghters. In addition, she’
worries that women will not be properly
obeyed if they advance to higher-level po-
sitions. ’

“I support it. I think that it’s greatthat
they’re giving women the opportunity to do
what they want in their career, but I don’t
think that it’s the best thing for the mili-
tary because where are you going to ﬁnd
women who can meet the same standards
as men?” Stoler said.

Stoler does not intend to ﬁght on the
combat lines herself. a—

“I don’t think that’s what women are
naturally born to do — to go to the front
lines,” she said. “If the woman is going

to be the weak link out there, that’s not

what I want.”

But ﬁrst—year ROTC student Joe Mc-
Clain, who plans to specialize in military
intelligence, does not agree with the idea
that women cannot hold serious leadership
roles in the military.

“A prime example is our class instructor
for our military science class, Captain []a—'
mie] Vincent — she’s a woman, she’s been
deployed to Iraq I believe twice, and she
went from second lieutenant to captain,”
McClain said. “A stigma of the fact that
women can’t be leaders or can’t lead men
is complete garbage.” .

Another fear of some skeptics is that
incorporating women into the infantry
could affect the “brotherhood” of squads.
But McClain says that soldiers will have to
adjust to the change.

“The way guys joke around in combat
is going to have to change and adapt to
women being in their environment,” he
said. “Once time has progressed, everyone
will [be] used to the idea.”

Lawson said that there is always a de-
bate over whether female troops should be
treated like ladies or like equals, and she
adds that she does not mind nor require
chivalry.

“If a guy wants to hold the door with me,
I’m ﬁne with that,” Lawson said. “As far as
equal, I like to be treated fairly —— I am the
only female cadet in my military science»
class, and they respect me as much as an
equal, though they are polite.”

Lawson believes that men should react
the same to a fallen female soldier as they
would for a male soldier.

“We all believe the same color —— red,
white, or blue. And we’re all there for a
reason,” she said. “Our warrior ethos is:
I will always place the mission ﬁrst, I will
never accept defeat, I will never quit, I will
never leave a fallen comrade. It doesn’t use
sex to identify the fallen comrade.”I

I tuned into see President Barack
Obama’s second inauguration
on Jan. 21. I got really nervous
when the ceremony started. I
wasn’t really thinking of security
breaches or anything of that sort.
I was worried that I had missed
Beyonce’s rendition of the “The
Star-Spangled Banner.”
Thankfully, I didn’t. She sang.
It was beautiful, just as I had ex-

she was lip-syncing.

Sure, we all felt a little’ be-
trayed. How could someone like
Beyonce trick us by using a re-
corded track of her vocal talent?

The general reaction, -though
initially characterized by distress,
was not totally anti—Beyonce, to
my relief. The classic justiﬁcation:
“At least it wasn’t like her voice
was altered with Auto—Tune.”

To which I say: So what? Auto-
Tune isn’t that big of a deal.

Music snobs and elitists, you
can put down the pitchforks and
torches. I am a person with solid

taste in music, or so I like to think,
and my preferences are varied.
The Beatles have been my favorite
for as long as I can remember. I
like classical music and took vio-
lin lessons for many years in my
youth. I listen to jazz while doing
homework, and I enjoy it. I listen
to Kanye West while running on

Conservative Americans are questioningtheir ideology

John Hasley
For The Pitt N ews

In the newest YouTube sensation, port-
ly Texan Alex Jones growls at TV pundit
Piers Morgan for about 15 minutes over
the latter’s views on gun restriction in
America. For all the fruitful debate they
get into vis-a—vis the topic, the clip might
as well have lasted about 10 seconds.

Jones, with a moonlike face and the
round, staring eyes of someone who per-
haps was weaned off his mother’s milk a
tad late, begins his line of reasoning in his
guttural argot, initially reflecting the rela-
tively calm demeanor of his interlocutor,
but proceeds apace into a short litany of
repressive governments that have in one
way or another prohibited their citizens’
access to ﬁrearms.

His argument proceeds like a cat in
heat, trolling and trundling along with
no particular direction in mind, train-
ing in ﬁts and starts upon things such as
the Chinese Cultural Revolution and “the
mega—banks that control the planet” un-
til he finds himself comfortable enough
to make a claim about the relationship
between a well—armed people and their
susceptibility to governmental tyranny.
It’s an art, but one that I cannot claim in
my current state of complete sobriety to
be a practitioner of.

Auto—Tune and its origins. It’s notjust for
making T—Pain’s voice sound the strange
way that it does.

The Auto—Tune software was originally
launched in 1997 as a means of pitch cor-
rection. Recording artists will naturally
go sharp or ﬂat at times in a vocal per-
formance. Auto—Tune, wherein producers
could slightly tweak the sound back to the
“pitch perfect” expectation of our ever-
so—critical ears, was invented to remedy
the situation.

The ﬁrst example of Auto—Tune the way
we know it ——-the robotic, computerized
type of sound that has become a standard
in today’s Top 40 music —— was Cher’s 1998
hit, “Believe.” Rather than just adjusting
the pitch, what emerged was a new sound

entirely. And it caught on.

The entirety of Kanye West’s album
“808s and Heartbreak” is a product of
Auto—Tune. Ke$ha,Justin Timberlake, Ma-
donna, Lil Wayne and Lady Gaga are all

a rhythm to the roundelay, a lilt to the
logorrhea.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Still looking for its ﬁrstwin against top—10i
opposition this season, Pitt awaits No. 6 Orange

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Petersen Events Center and the fans
who occupy it will receive another oppor-
tunity to test the arena’s reputation as the
place “Where Top 10 Teams Come to Die”
Saturday, when No. 6 Syracuse will roll
into Pittsburgh to take on the Panthers.

Pitt (17—5,‘5-4 Big East) will have a
chance to gain invaluable ground on the
Orange (18—2, 6—1 Big East), who currently
lead the conference standings, while the
Panthers trail by 2 1/2 games.

“It’s the kind of big game we have been
looking up to,” redshirt junior forward
Talib Zanna said. “We’re looking forward
to Saturday and coming out and making
a statement.” A

Working offensively against the 2-3‘

zone Syracuse will use in competition
with the Panthers, Zanna’s play on the
interior will serve as possibly the most im-
portant key in breaking down head coach
Jim Boeheim’s notorious defenses, with
which both Zanna and Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon are already familiar. '

But Zanna’s recent play has left a great
deal to be desired. He was the team’s pri-
mary scoring" option in nonconference play
but has only topped double-figures once
since Big East play started. Fortunately for
Pitt, Zanna has stayed aggressive during
this difficult stretch and is not changing
his style of play.

“I just gotta be patient and let the game
come to me,” he said. “I— think sometimes I
rushed my shots, so I gotta take my time.”

Dixon himself has been happy with Zan-
na’s level of effort despite the drop in his
leading scorer’s production. Dixon cited
how Zanna has been working in games
and noted that the player had a “great”
practice Thursday.

“He’s active, he’s playing hard. He’s
coming up with loose balls and rebounds,
so it’s not effort,” Dixon said. “He’s getting
the shots  the effort’s there, and good
things are going to happen.”

Against the zone, Dixon stressed the
need for the Panthers to play sharp basket-
ball every time they have possession and
to limit their turnovers —— something they
didn’t do against DePaul on Saturday (18
total turnovers) and Monday at Louisville
(13). As such, turnovers will deﬁnitely be
a concern, given Syracuse’s size on the
inside and outside, which always causes
problems for opposing offenses.

Since Jamie Dixon took over as

A number of Pitt sports teams are preparing
for action this weekend, highlighted by a
men’s basketball game against No. 6 Syra-
cuse. Here’s a guide for this weekend’s games.

Friday

All day — Men’s and Women’s Track, Ak-

Day one of the Akron Invitational be-
gins Friday. Future Olympic hopeful and
current Big East Track Athlete of the Week
Brycen Spratling leads the men’s team into
the two-day competition. Spratling broke
his own school record last weekend at the
Penn State National Meet in the 2o0—meter
and 400—meter dash. Elizabeth Kline, who

came in second place last weekend in the_,._

whereas the women are 3-3 on the year.
The men are coming offback-to-back wins

The Pitt men’s basketball team will host
the biggest game of the year Saturday af— ‘

sixth—ranked Syracuse Orange for a “Gold
Out.” All fans in attendance will receive a
gold “This Is Our House” T-shirt. Syracuse
will only be the second ranked team the Pan-
thers have faced this season in the friendly
conﬁnes of the Petersen Events Center. The
Panthers will look to pick up the ﬁrst victory
of the season against a top—25 opponent. In
the ﬁrst Big East game of the year, Pitt lost

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Upsets abound, add to inherent drama of conference play  

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Another seven days have gone by along with
another week of upset—ﬁl1ed Big East bas-

‘ ‘— ketball.

Notables include Villanova taking down
then-No. 3 Syracuse after beating then-No.

5 Louisville, and Georgetown knocking off

Louisville in the Cardinals’ ensuing contest.
Now only two teams have a single loss in

conference play, and everyone else is part of

a bunch: The remaining 13 teams own at least
three losses, and eight teams sit only 2 1/2
games behind the current conference leaders.

1. No. 6 Syracuse (18-2, 6-1 Big East)

The Orangemen’s last game was a 75-71

_ , loss against Villanova last Saturday. This Sat-
: urday, Syracuse —— a team whose head coach
Jim Boeheim said Thursday is “as good as
anybody in this league” — will face another
strong test against Pitt at the Petersen Events
Center.

2. No. 25 Marquette (15—4, 6-1)

After losing a big game to No. 24 Cincin-
nati last week, Buzz Williams regrouped his
team to pick up wins against Providence
and South Florida.]unior guard Vander Blue
highlighted the individual efforts, scoring 30
points against USF. Marquette will now play

. .% arguably the best team on its schedule this

year at Louisville on Sunday.

3. No. 12 Louisville (17-4, 5-3)

Despite dropping two in a row, Louisville is
still Louisville, as it showed by holding on for
a three-point win against Pitt (more on that
later). The Cardinals can make up ground in
the conference race Sunday when they play
Marquette.

4. No. 24 Cincinnati (17-4, 5-3)

The Bearcats rebounded from their two-
point loss to Syracuse with a double-digit
victory over reeling Rutgers on Wednesday

! .6 and will face Seton Hall and Providence in

the next week. Expect Mick Cronin’s squad
to stay near the top of the standings — at
least for this week.
5. Pittsburgh (17—5, 5-4)
Throughout the season, Pitt has shown
it can play with anyone in the country — an
5 ability that became evident Monday against
Louisville. But the Panthers shot themselves
in their proverbial foot with turnovers and
atrocious free-throw shooting, resulting in
a 64-61 loss of a game that could have re-
established Pitt’s national legitimacy this sea-

~  son. The week is no easier for Jamie Dixon’s

Panthers as they face Syracuse at home Sat-
urday in a test of the Petersen Events Center’s
reputation as a place where “Top 10 Teams
Come to Die.”

6. Villanova (13—8, 4-4)

Somehow, Villanova’s system of “stand
around the perimeter and wait to shoot
contested threes” is working, and against
the conference’s best teams nonetheless. In
arguably the best week for any team in the

February 1 , 2018 I The Pitt News | V\/\/\/\/V.DlllﬂE3WS.COITl

Villanova upset two top-10 teams in the span of a week, muddling the order of things in the Big East — not that they cared. MCT

history of Philadelphia sports, the Wildcats
upset both Louisville and Syracuse.

Villanova has been about as ]ekyll-and-
Hyde as it gets, with those two wins follow-
ing a three-game losing streak. After beat-
ing Louisville and ’Cuse, ’Nova lost to Notre
Dame. Things should get a little easier for the
Wildcats, with games against Providence and
DePaul coming up.

7. St.]ohn’s (14—7, 6-3)

The Red Storm will enter the weekend
riding a ﬁve-game winning streak, although
not against the conference’s best competition
—- two of those wins came against DePaul. But
wins are wins, and St.]ohn’s will have a chance
at revenge Saturday against Georgetown,
which beat SJU by 16 in the ﬁrst matchup.

8. Georgetown (15—4, 4-3)

Another case of ajekyll-and-Hyde team,
the Hoyas managed to look like the best team
in the conference by beating Louisville and
the worst by losing earlier to USF. George-
town will take a three-game winning streak

into the weekend against Rutgers and has a
good opportunity against the Scarlet Knights

to push the streak to four before playing Mar-
quette on Monday.

9. Connecticut (13—5, 3-3)

UConn won its ﬁrst game in more than two
weeks on Sunday with a 12-point victory over
Rutgers. The Huskies should be able to place
themselves over .500 with games against
Providence and USF up next on the docket.

1o. Notre Dame (17-4, 5-3)

It seems the Fighting Irish responded
properly to their 16_-point loss to George-
town onjan. 21, winning their next two games
against USF and Villanova. After a matchup
with DePaul will be a trip to upstate New York
to play Syracuse at the Carrier Dome.

11. Providence (10-16, 2-6)

The Friars are by no means one of the Big
East’s better teams, but don’t tell them that.
Although they own a poor record, the Friars
knocked off Villanova last week and played
very close games with Pitt and Marquette
recently.

12. Seton Hall (13-8,’2—6)

The Pirates have only won one of their last
seven games, and it doesn’t appear that things

will get any better moving forward. Seton
Hall’s next three games will come against
Cincinnati, Pitt and UConn.

13. Rutgers (12-8, 3-6)

Another team nose-diving, the Scarlet
Knights dropped four straight games, effec-
tively eliminating the hope that they would
compete at the top of the conference.

14. South Florida (10-10, 1-7)

For USF, the victory against Georgetown
continues to hold up as one of few for the
Bulls this season. The Bulls have gone on a
three-game skid since, with little chance of
ending soon: Their next three games come
against UConn, Marquette and Villanova.

15. DePaul (10-10, 1-6)

USF would be in the basement of the con-

ference if it weren’t for DePaul, a team that
remains winless in the past four weeks of
competition. DePaul played certain teams

very closely, but then Pitt delivered a 48-point

beatdown Saturday on the Blue Demons. It

doesn’t help that Brandon Young and Cleve-

land Melvin seem to be playing poorly at the

worst possible time. [

“I think [size] is a big factor in their
zone. It makes it harder to penetrate,
harder to reverse the ball and harder to
get interior touches.” Dixon said. “We’ve
had success against it, but we need to ex-
ecute against it on every play.”

Another key to unlocking the Orange
zone will rest on the perimeter in how the
guards handle the basketball and pen-
etrate, according to redshirt junior Lamar
Patterson.

“Attacking the zone is something we’ve
been good at in the past,” Patterson said.
“To beat the zone, we have to get inside
and get in the middle of it.”

Defensively, the guards will also have
to shut down Brandon Triche and Michael
Carter-Williams, two of the conference’s
best guards. Carter—Williams leads the na-
tion in assists per game, lending a helping
hand 8.9 times per game alongside his 12.6
points—per—game average. 4

C No matter which way it’s sliced or
diced, Carter—Williams accounts for a lot
of Syracuse's offense.

Rebounding should be expected to play
a large role with thg emphasisjamie Dixon

placéﬁs on boards each game. Syracuse is
one of the nation’s best teams at rebound-

V’ ‘ ing the basketball, ranked No. 25 with 42

rebounds per game as a team. Pitt ranks
No. 151, with 35.7 boards per game.

But really, the Panthers just need to do
what all good college basketball teams do:
win their conference home games. Pitt,
with a winning percentage over .900 since
play began at the Petersen Events Center a
little over a decade ago, is 2-2 at home this

season and could see a rare drop below the

.500 mark if things go poorly Saturday.

“We gotta win our home games,” Dixon
said. “We haven’t done that .., We need a
win Saturday.”

The win could have massive implica-
tions on the rest of the season for the
Panthers as they barrel into the second
half of conference play.

“We need a win like this right now,”
Patterson said. I
