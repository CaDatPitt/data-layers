EEOC Invesligales University Undergrdcls Permilled

To Teach Courses

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

The presence of the United
States Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Committee (EEOC) on the
campus of the University is. ac-
cording to Dr. Sharon Johnson,‘a
step in the right direction toward
attaining women’s rights.

Johnson, a research biochemist
who has filed a tenure case with
the EEOC, says that Pitt report-
edly has the dubious honor of be-
ing the first university to be inves-
tigated by that branch of the Nix-
on administration.

Johnson, affiliated with the

‘Hniversity since 1967, claims that

tenure was denied her, based only
on a patter of campus-wide bias
against women in general.

“I have taken my case through
all women’s committees in the
University," she said. "Many of
them are advisory, having no pow-
er and some are merely in the
formative stages."

Johnson says she tried work-
ing through these committees
prior to filing with the EEOC. One
of those bodies, the Academic
Freedom and Tenure Committee.

A she says decided that evidence of

sex discrimination was present in
her particular case. In a letter to
Johnson, they also suggested “the
cfquirements for tenure had not
been sufficiently delineated by
the chairman of the dep_artment.

Responding to this, Johnson
maintains that she fully met the
tenure requirements explained to
her by the department chairman
in 1967. A new chairman, how-
ever, headed the department at
the time of her request for full
tenure.

In week-long workshop. the

activities. "The purpose of this.“
Hirst explained-, “was to make
the resident assistant knowledge-
able, since he acts as the connect-
ing link between the administra-
tion and the students."

§iie stated further that the bas-
ic role of the RA is to be involved
and help the students in every pos-
sible way. “Resident assistants
should be both available and ap-
proachable,” she emphasized.

Miss Hirst pointed out that. in
order to fulfill all of these obliga-
tions. the RA’s must be on the
floor consistently during the eve-
ning—for this reason the tentative
hours of 7:30 p.m. to 7 a.m. were
designated during which the RA’s
must be available.

In the event that an RA cannot
be on the floor. he must notify the
students by leaving a note on the

would clarify her situation. The
most recent development, she
says, has been a letter in late Aug-
ust from the American Associa-
tion of University Professors
(AAUP) suggesting that her case
should be turned over to the Chan-
cellor. The letter says the organ-
ization would be supportive in
Johnson’s attempt to press for a
full faculty hearing.

A report in The Pittsburgh Press
on Sept. 11 stating that mem-
bers of the Tenure Committee
were willing to hear her case was,
Johnson said, “News to me.” She
has received no official word to
that effect. '

According to Johnson. the role
of the EEOC will be determining
if violations of civil rights are pre-
sent within the University struc-
ture. In essence, she says, the in-
vestigative team is empowered to
delve into the civil rights of all

only verbally that she was being
refused tenure because her work
was ‘too chemical” and not in
line with the goals of the depart-
ment. ‘

To date, Johnson says she has
not been granted a hearing which

women in each department.

The task forcesent to Pitt. she
says. is an outgrowth of the 1972
addition to the Civil Rights Act of
1964. The former clarified that
universities were not exempt
from equal employment rulings.

By-laws . Allegedly Violated

Undergraduate students in the
University‘s College of Arts and
Sciences can now teach some
courses themselves under the
newly established Chancellor’s
Undergraduate Teaching Fellow-
ships.

The program will allow juniors
and seniors of outstanding merit
to learn the rudiments of teaching
at the college level, while gaining
academic credit and financial re-
muneration for their services.
Twenty-five fellowships are avail-
able at $500 each.

The program had its informal
inception several months ago
when a number of departments

began using upper-class students

as teachers in undergraduate
courses. University faculty re-
ported satisfaction with the re-
sults of the experiment and the
student teachers seemed to find
the experience a uniformly re-
warding one.

The CAS Council, which had en-
couraged the experiment, wanted
to insure that students would not
be exploited as a cheap labor

"We got messed up with publi-
city.” said Emanuel, who felt that
this was the major reason for the
low number of tickets that were
sold. Large silk screen posters
that were ordered to advertise the
event and has not arrived in time
for the concern, so the Program-
ming Board resorted to designing
their own posters and having them

‘ printed.

Asked about the financial side
of the concert, which cost approxi-
mately $6,300, Emanuel replied,
"Financially. we suffered a loss.
but we did well in setting charac-
ter.” He added. "We are interest-
ed in attracting a crowd rathgr
than making money.” 

The estimated l,7_0_-0 people,
whohalf-filled the Syria Mosque,
“really enjoyed the concert,” said

. Last Friday, students walking
through the Tower’s Lobby were
delighted to find that that they
were being offered free tickets to
the "Ultimate Symphonic Rock
Concert Superstar” by members
of the Student Government Board.

They may have been surprised
if they had already noticed one of
the posters or ads earlier in the
week announcing that tickets for
the concert were $2 "a piece and
even more so if they were one of
the 38 students who bought one of
these tickets.

According to Bob Eiﬁanuel, a
member of the Student Govern-
ment Programming Board, which
sponsored the event, the decision
to make the concert free was
reached the Thursday evening be-
fore the concert at a meeting of

The cycle display will also be featured again from 9 a.m. to 12

The Council also requires that

The advantages of the program,
according to Dr. Jerome B.

Duke Carnival

One of a Kind

by J IMYI-IOSEK

(DPPA)—Carnival, a major
yearly effort of the Duquesne Uni-
versity Greek community, is the
only event of its kind among West-
ern Pennsylvania colleges and
universities. .

Begun in 1951, when emphasis
was taken away from the annual
Homecoming, Carnival has devel-
oped intoa program respected by
the university and Pittsburgh
community alike.

During Carnival, the Hilltop I’

campus’ Bluff is turned into a V ‘C

miniature tent city. Each of the
seven show tents features an orig-
inal show performed by a spon-

soring fraternity and sorority.

Music, choreography and scripts '
are arranged by the Greeks —
some original, some not.

A concentrated effort with scen- A

ery and construction of the stages
and tents is done within a week
prior to the shows.

Work, however,‘ on scripts,

choreography ‘and music begins . C

as early as a year before hand.

This year’s shows range from
settings_ in ancient‘ Rome to life
beyond the planets.

New Frat Advisor Assumes Duties

Dan Malero--Unbiased Leader

Lou McClinden, fraternity ad-
visor since 1964, has handed the
reins of guidance over to Daniel
Melero, a 1970 CMU graduate.
The new fraternity advisor admits
to having little previous experi-
ence at dealing with fraternities,
but he thinks this will work to his
advantage, giving him an unbiased
approach to the situation.

Melero views himself as a lai-
son between IFC and the Univer-
sity, a type of middleman whose
job it is to strengthen the lines of
communication between the
Greeks~and the University. and
also between the individual
houses and the alumni.

“The major cause of friction

here is misinformation. Part of’

my job is to make sure everyone
'receives the same set of facts. I
have always belie_ved that if the
truth is known the problem can be
solved.”

Melero inherits from his pre-
decessor a situation which he
finds quite promising. Tradition-

ally strong involvement by
Greeks in University organiza-
tions continues. Five out of sev-
en Student Government members
belong to fraternities. and the
only female on the board is in a
sorority.

Fraternities are enjoying a
surge in popularity across the
country as the number of pledges
went up 10 per cent nationwide
last year. Melero is optimistic
about Pitt"s fraternities and of-
fers his intuitive thoughts on the
direction of the "fraternal struc-
ture, something he terms as "a
new era of interest."

“It seems to be that there is-
less self interest by the individual
houses and more concern with the,
Greek community as a whole.
There is a strong interest to make
the Greek system work,” Malero
said. .

This is evidenced by improving
communications between the fra-
ternities and an increasing will-
ingness to iron out differences
through IFC. Perhaps the most
noticeable trend of “the new era"
is represented by the change in
the rush system. '

Because Pitt has gone from a
largely residential to a predom—'
inately commuter school, rush is
more open. Aside from this purely
technical adaptation, rush tech-
niques and attitudes have under-

gone a serious switch.

Melero explained, “When I was
a freshmen all the guys would get
dressed up in coats and ties and
go en masse to the various house
rush parties in hopes of getting a
bid. Now the situation is quite dif-
ferent.”

Now the initiative lies with the
fraternities. Each house must
find the interests of the individual
rushee and show that individual
how the characteristics of that
particular fraternity fits his in-
terests. A sales pitch is required,
one which combats the stereotyp-
ing of fraternity members as an
undiversified lot.

"Fraternities are the largest
organized group on campus. With
a thousand good, organized men
just about anything can be accom-
plished,” Malero concluded.

Siuclent Job Placement

 Service Oile red  

V by LARRY HAND

Most students on campus are
probably not aware of one of the
functional agencies at Pitt. the
office of student employment. This
University agency is solely re-
sponsible for the placement of un-
dergraduate and graduate stu-
dents seeking part-time employ-
ment on and off campus.

The job makret is - declining
across the nation and consequent-
ly the ratio of applicants per job
‘has increased steadily. The Office
of Student Employment has ac-
cordingly adopted a just policy
towardthe placement of students.
Tom Rush of this office stated.
“We really do not want students to
possess more than one_iob because
of the prevailing situation of scar-
city of jobs. However, if it is an
absolute necessity, we will try to
help a student be placed in a sec-
on job off campus.”

_ Rush also stated that any full
time -University graduate or un-
dergraduate is eligible for em-
ployment through the bureau. The
igbs average 10 to 15 hours per
4.. ek in positions such as clerks,
key punch operators, library as-
sistants, kitchen help or repair
work.iPark time employment is
available during all three school
terms as well as the summer ses-
sion.

Students who are interested in
full time summer employment
may contact the office during the
winter, term for applications and

interviews. There are also some _

openings each year for engineer-
ing students who have completed
their junior year, in the field of
training program. Part-time stu-

   
   

dents who are seeking employ-
ment may apply through the Ca-
reer ff. _ g

TOM RU

Although the job market is de-
clining, placement of 65 per cent
of the applicants was accomplish-
ed last year. A total of 4.342 appli-
cants applied and some 2,810 of
those were placed in some type of
work.

Interested students should re-
fer to 224 in the Student Union to
file an application. Any student
who has worked in previous years
but not in this school term and are
still interested in seeking em-
ployment should revise their ap-
plication in the office.

As The Fee Goes

50 -Goes Everything

Students who complain that there is little to do at this University
might consider the situation which would result if the activities fee is

"voted down in January's referendum.

Many of the student activities and services now funded by the fee ,
would cease to exist, according to Dean of Student Af'fairs Alfred Moye.
Those which continue will involve a greater direct cost to students.

The Homecoming tickets which now cost $4 would sell for $10,
according to Moye, if there is no fee to support the event.

The free concerts and other events which Student Government is
sponsoring this year would cease to exist if the fee is voted down, ac-
cording to SG Board member Terry Sadler.

The year book which now costs students $5 would run $15, accord-
ing to Owl editor Gary Spicuza. «-

The Pitt News, which is distributed free, would charge $350 per
student without the fee’s support, according to Business Manager Mar-

_ ty Meltzer.

Consultations with the attorney retained by Student Government’s

- Legal Awareness Committee which now costs $5 per half hour would

run $25 per hour, according to Committee Chairman Jeff Pasek.

The interest free medical loans provided by SG’s Medical Action
Committee would cease to exist along with other MAC services such as
reduced rates for eye glasses.

Moye reported that in event of the fee’§ demise, the activities and
services which would survive would be funded out of University hard

. monies (which would come from a tuition hike). This money would rest

in the Dean of Student Affair’s budget.

Moye also said thatlthis would empower the dean to cut off funding
for any organization that incurred .-his disfavor.

I spend a great deal of my time discovering
idiocies in the world around me. This may indicate
a lack of taste, or a somehow deranged set of prior-
ities. No matter what the implications of this odd
habit, I’m stuck with it. And Pitt is an incredibly
rich source of idiocies.

The people at Szabo (always good for a laugh)
have disappointed me on one point. Apart from-qual-
ity of food service atmosphere, etc. They have neg-
lected to provide me with a glossy self-congratula-
tory pamphlet describing the vast immensity of
their operation. Among the amazing statistics
which make up the heart of such a report, I’d ex-
pect a listing of the enormous number of meals pre-
pared and served, and the number of cups of coffee
sold every single day.

Since they won’t do it, I'll h_ave to make up some
statistics. At a guess, 25,000'people drift through the
campus daily. If each of them drinks four-tenths of
a cup of coffee per day—and most of us could man-
age that much—then 10,000 cups of coffee would
swirl down the collective gullet. These figures are
conservative. I am not. '

Some readers ,may think that drinking that
much Szabo coffee is idiocy enoght, and it may well
be. But there is more to come. Here at Pitt, where
PIRG is-large and loud, where eco—fr'eaks set out in

‘ ‘frail canoes to challenge polluters on the murky

Monongahela, where the automobile is soundly and
regularly cursed for blistering our lungs and en-
dangering our limbs, where. . .

I could probably go on, but I won’t. The shrill
tone of it all is making my eyes cross. More quiet-
ly, then . . .

Here at Pitt, where ecology is well thought of,
and the very sugar which accompanies our coffee
tips us off to species we might not have considered
endangered, each of these myriad coffees is served
in an individual foam cup.

Foam cups are not all bad. They represent a
triumph of technology. Not even the strongest cof-
fee can soal_them into soggy ruins‘. The outsides
stay cool to the touch, while the contentsremain hot
much longer than they would in waxed paper or
plastic. A limited number of clever things can be
made from them. And that’s about it.

They have several drawbacks. My original re-
action. when the things first appeared, was that
they were unpleasant to drink from. They’ have a
nasty texture to the lip. They are also inconvenient-
ly light, and inclined to tip over when only part—full.
But these are minor quibbles. The real problem with
foam cups is that they are made of foam.

Plastic foam cups are undoubtedly handy for
the Szabo people. They are cheap, they are light,

and they are disposable. They also save expense.

Grad Student Housing Inadequate

by DAN DOLINSKY
Pitt Tenant Union

You’re a grad student at the University. You’ve grown accustom-
ed-to the pressures and tensions of pursuing a degree. University life

. and personal involvements have become firmly enmeshed in your life

style so that there is no dichotomy between them. Four years of under-

~ graduate work have been emotionally as well as physically draining.

’ Where to live is a constant problem and you’ve been through more

, - roommates than you care to remember. You’re experience with local
, landlords have taught you to expect high rent for an inadequate apart-

ment.'But, since you are a grad student, the University is trying to pro-

- vide low rent housing to meet your dwindling financial resources.

The University has leased several buildings from private realtors
in an attempt to meet the needs of the grad students. One of the Uni-
versity signed leases is with the Prudential Realty Company for the
Koch'Apartments on Centre Ave. This lease is currently in its third
year of a ten year contract.

' The dilapidated condition of'some of these apartments available to
grad students is a disgrace and an embarrassment to the University.

. Complaints about the lack of repairs have been voiced this past week

through the Pitt Tenant Union. Students have cited the following items
as being in need of immediate repair: faulty plumbing, cracking plas-

’ 1 'ter, borken toilets, filthy carpeting, cockroaches, poor ventilation,

overcrowding in bedrooms, missing doors and unpainted walls. It reads
like a list of complaints you might receive from the Dixie Motel, but in
fact is the problems of just two Oakland apartments. The students,
with their own funds have taken the iniative to try and_make their apart-
ment ‘f1ivable.”.

Despite many complaints to the University the students have yet
to see any effort to make the repairs. The University contends that the

""responsi‘bility for repair rests with the Prudential Realty Company.
‘ Upon contacting the realtors 1 was told they were not empowered to do

_ anything about the condition of the building unless they got a direct
referral from the University. Whereupon contacting the University

3 ‘again I was informed of aI50 page memorandum being sent to the Pru-
I-,_,(l_el_ll.’lal _I_{ealty Co. _describing the condition of the apartments. All the
‘ while this bureaucratic juggling is going on it is the students who suffer.

One of the grad students describes his plight thusly: “The condi-
. tion of my apartment is intolerable. So far nothing has been done at all.
In order to survive we had to fix, at our own expense, the bathroom toil-
et and plumbing; also, since no cleaning has been done, cleaning which
we were told would be done before our arrival, we had to spend "three
days making the place sanitary. An exterminator was called to rid us
of numerous roaches, but other major requirements have not been met

yet. -

“Filthy conditions still remain in the hallways and in our apart-
ment, and a chair still remains unrepaired. When we arrived we found
mold on the garbage left on the shelves and filthy, stove and refrigera-

tor. We cleaned these out of dire necessity.

“Plumbing remains a problem. We have slow drainage in our tub
and bathroom sink, our toilet still needs repairs, and we bought new

toilet fixtures at the cost of $5 in order to use it.

“Electricity is dangerously substandard. Each room has only one
outlet, our fuses are 30 rather than the legal 15 amps, and our lights

dim when we use appliances.

“Most dangerous of all are structural weaknesses. A bedroom ceil-
ing and the living room ceiling both leak, the plaster has yellowed and
begun to fall, exposing the cheap cardboard structure of the ceiling.

 

Foam Cups Feed Pollution

parts of the world once manufactured.

Each cup is used just once. Then it is discard-
ed. It is generally bundled into a plastic bag; the
bags are collected until time to ship ‘them off in a
truck. The truck hauls the cups and other refuse to
a collection point, and the whole mess eventually
reaches a “sanitary land fill.” This is current bu-
reaucratese for a garbage dump. The term “sani-
tary” rarely occurs to people at these garbage
dumps.

At this point the cup’s career has hardly begun.
It is a nearly indestructible artifact of a society
gone mad and choking itself to death.

 

The cup is flammable, but it emits a foul and 5".-i

probably dangerous smoke when burned. It can be
shredded, but that only reduces its bulk. It will not
rot, or even mildew. Small predators may enjoy
rolling it around, but they will not eat it, even for
roughage. And the hardiest bacteria admit defeat
and slink off to more palatable leavings.

It may be argued that the foam cup is a neces-
sity in our society. Szabo may say so out loud and
cite high labor costs as a justification, but it is not
true. Here at Pitt, like the rest of the world, we are
unable to tell necessity from convenience.

The price of this convenience is becoming ap-
parent. A chunk of North Park was recently dedi-
cated as a “transfer station.” Guess what it trans-
fers. North of here an indignant municipal govern-
ment is insisting on its right to use part of the Alle-
gheny National Forest for a garbage dump. Some of

its neighbor communities insist that the expense of“
sewage treatment creates the “necessity” of dump- 

ing “waste products” (another deodorized word.
The stuff looks and smells like shit) into the rivers.

While we discuss this, let’s go down for a cup
of coffee.

One student suggests that this would be a fine
chance for an enterprising group to contract to
provide and wash real cups for our coffee. It might
work, and it might even make money. That could be
just what it takes to make concern for the environ-’
merit respectable.

Dovison...New Pied Piper?

Editors note: This is the sec-
ond of a series of articles spot-
lighting local talent.

By STEVE LUBETSKY

If she were to wander up and
down streets. singing songs, like
the Pied Piper of Hamlin with his
flute, Sharon Davison would in
short time attract throngs of mer-
ry followers. However, her fan
club would consist not only of
children, as inthe fairytale, but
rather include adults, adolescents,
and college students as well.

It is difficult and unusual for
any performer tosatisfy so many
diverse elements without om-
promising her talents, but Sharon,
a student at CM-U, has discov-
ered the formula. She is adept at
singing everything from “White

' Rabbit” and “Proud Mary,” to

“-~

“The Charade” and “Laura’s
Theme” from Dr. Zhivago. Her
vocal inflections enable her to
“belt out a tune orcaress it,”
whatever style is demanded.

Sharon, who is 21, has more
than 375 engagements to her
credit since she entered profes-
sional work l2 years ago. Her
public debut came at 9 when she
sang with a band with which she
never rehearsed, yet produced
superb results. “I. think the first
time I knew I could be something
more then just a casual enter-
tainer,” she remarked, “was when
I was called back for an encore.”.

Since then, Sharon has sung in

coffeehouses, at parties and social-

events, at the Allegheny County
Fair, and on various TV programs.
She appears in nightclubs such as
the Holiday House, the Moose,

and three years ago was featured
at the Casbah in Shadyside. Last
month she appeared at the One
World Festival of Music at Pitt
Stadium, and currently, she can
be seen at the Charade Lounge
on Northern Pike in Monroe-
ville.

In choosing her program, Shar-

on is very particular as to what.

songs she’ll perform. “I like do-
ing songs with meaning,” she ex-
plained. “My favorite songs deal
with relationships between peo-
ple.”

Sharon frequently borrows ma-
terial from artists such as Kris
Kristofferson, Grace Slick, and
the late Janis Joplin, and rein-
terprets in according to her tech-
nique. “Doing a song your own
way is a_n expression of your feel-
ings,” she stated.

When she performs, Sharon
plays either a 6- or 12-string gui-
tar accompaniment, which she
considers as “a personal instru-
ment which gives me a chance to
do more with a song.”

Her guitar plays “an important
part in arranging,” which, along-
side of singing and picking, is one
of Sharon’s special knacks. In ad-
dition she gives guitar lessons in
her spare time.

on intends to perform on it pub-

licly when it is mastered, she is
already using it for composition.

Sharon’s family has contributed
to her present status. “My uncle
plays piano, and my cousin is a
concert pianist,” she said, com-
menting on her musical heritage.

Moreover, she added, my parents a

“have given me the confidence
needed to be a great performer.”

For a long time Sharon has con-
templated recording and has, in
fact, been offered several con-
tracts. At present she is “in the
process of negotiations.”

She cut her first record when
she was 15. Backed by the Four
Coins, it was sold to Gateway, but
never was plugged because the
company’ went out of business
soon after.

Reflecting on that experience,
Sharon conceded that she is hap-
py now that her record was not
successful. “Education then was
more important, and I enjoyed
high school very much.”

Now, although she would like to
complete college, Sharon made
clear that she would not hesi-
tate. if opportunity knocks. “I
don’t let school stand in my way,”
she insisted.

Sharon views her role of musi-
cian as that of communicator and

entertainer.

Clark's Film Series

Needs ‘Restoration’

By ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Many of us who consider ourselves disciples of art historian Ken- A

neth Clark in recent years because of his Civilisation series have wait-
ed anxiously for the debut of his new six part series, Pioneers of Mod-_
ern Painting. That series finally arrived in our fair city this past week

and with its advent came the end of our vigil and perhaps even more 

importantly, the end of our discipleship as well.

To the chagrin of many of us, the technical expertise in both script
and photography which comes to mind when Lord Clark’s personal

-view of civilization is recalled- has, in Pioneers. declined to a some-

what unsatisfactory state.

. Those pearls of insight which were so prevalent in the former ser-
ies have been replaced by a delivery which reflects an almost senile
nature on the part of the narrator.

Graphically, the beauty and precision of the BBC’s Civilisation
series has seemingly been sacrificed for a father-son dialogue. In this
new series, Colin Clark has taken upon himself the full responsibility,
of director with rather lamentable results. ’

While the color quality in the shooting of works of art was diffi-
cult to discern in the first installment (which was devoted to Manet
and therefore indued with chartreuse, black and white, ridiculous
outdoor shots of Clark’s “fading into the sunset” persisted throughout
the film.

We certainly would not attempt to hang. Clark’s reputation on
these half dozen films (those devoted to Cezanne, Monet, Rousseau,
Seurat and Munch complete the series) for. his writing and filming pri-
or to Pioneers has certainly been admirable.

Perhaps the only real explanation for disappointment is the fact,
that Civilisation spoiled us. We too readily considered it the culmin-
ation of one art historian’s work. Pioneers shows that Clark evidently
feels that his work has yet to be completed, but perhaps it would be
best that he reconsider that decision.

Pioneers Prevail, 5-2

By RICK ROSENTHAL ‘

The Pitt mitters lost 5-2 Wed-
nesday afternoon at Trees Field
due to the home run power of
the Point Park Pioneers. Frank
Gustine‘s squad was led by a long
two run blast by starting pitcher
Jim Ney and a solo homer chip-‘
ped in by third baseman Brian
Conti. A

The mitters took an early 1-0
lead in the first when shortstop
Joe Groetch lined an inside fast-
ball off the leftfield fence’ for a
double. _Rick Monroe then pop-
ped 0ut_to’the third baseman, but

_ The Pioneers came back in their
half of the third when Ney batting
with catcher Billy Meyers on first
from a walk, lofted a high shot
to left. Ron Bassett backed up
against the wall in a vain attempt
to catch it. but it cleared the
fence for a homer making the

' score 2-1..

The mitters came back to the
the game in the fourth when Den-
ny Toboz led the inning off with
a pop single which barely feel in

continuing with his policy of put-
ting in a new pitcher each inning.
in order to get a clear picture of
exactly what kind of talent he has
in waiting for’ the coming spring

‘ season. Kennedy pitched well his

first inning with the exception of
a hitsbatsman, but erased this
mistake by picking Terry Thomp-

, son. the runner, off of first.

However, it was Kennedy’s sec-
ond inning which gave him trou-
ble. Harry Westwood "led off that
inning with a routine groundball

'to third, but what looked like a

perfectly good throw by third
baseman Quarantillo pulled fresh-
man Keith Nystrom off the bag.

Jim Miles then doubled to l_eft-
center on a ball which took a fun-
ny bounce and this enabled West-

wood to score from first with the

third Pioneer run. the mitters were
unable to mount any kind of threat
from the fourth inning on.

The scoring was not yet over

however, as John Chir the next-

mitter hurler walked shortstop
Joe Zyra. Zyra then stole second.
came to third on an infield out

and was balked home. ‘

The crowning touch came in
the eighth as Conti sent a wicked
shot over the leftfield fence.;leav-
ing Mike Halferty standing dead
in his tracks as he watched help-
lessly.

Relief pitcher John Rees got

’ credit for the win. while Kennedy

was the loser.

 

Dennis Toboz, seenlhere hitting against the Westminister Titans last
spring, singled. Wednesday and scored the mitters second run in their

5-2 loss to the Point‘Park Pioneers.

The Panther junior varsity foot-
ball team swings into action today
with their first game of the sea-
son, an away game with West Vir-
ginia. The Cubs play three games
in the entire season, so they will
be up for this one.

Handling the coaching chores
for the entire JV season will be
graduate assistants Dan Lynn,
‘Ed Sadowski, and John Sembi-
ante. In addition. two coaches will
be on loan from the varsity. For
the Mountaineer game, these
coaches will be Steve Petro on de-
fense and Paul Kemp on offense.

The JV’s have been working out
with the, varisty and therefore
will be running the same types of
offense and defense. The team will
be composed mostly ‘of freshman,
just as the WVU team.

“We’ll be running what we know
best,” explained Coach‘ Petro,
“There will be a limited number
of plays, though, as the boys just
haven’t had time to learn all of

_ them.

“There hasn’t been too much of
a chance for them to practice the
plays,” he added. “Most of the
time they’ve been running the up-
coming opponent’s defense. I am
pleased that most of the boys are
in real good physical shape. We
don’t have any serious injuries."

West Virginia will be using two
different defenses, the 5-2 and the
4-3. Pitt will use the 5-2, similar
to the varsity. It is not known how
much practice -West Virginia’s

players have had.

RICH WASHINKO
Starting QB

All together, about 40 players
will make the trip to Morgantown,
including a few walk-ons. Other
walk-ons not making the trip have
the talent, but are completely un-
familiar with the plays and would
therefore be easily succeptible to
injury.

“Our spirit is real good,” the en-

thused assistant coach Lynn stat- -

ed, “We’re ready to go after West
Virginia and beat them."

Each junior varsity game, in
addition to the experience it of-
fers, also affords the players an

-opportunity to show their skills

under actual game conditions.-If
a player has a real strong show-
ing, he stands a good chance to

Coming off a strong showing against a tough Bucknell University
team. the Pit_t soccer team will open the 1972 home season when the
face West Chester State tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in Pitt Stadium. ‘
West Chester State has always been a tough opponent for the boot-
ers and last year topped the Panthers by a 4-2 score. But injuries.play-
ed a big part in the contest as four Pitt booters were knocked out of
action because of the rough style of play. A  --
. Thisyear coach Leo Bemis hopes to have his squad in better shape
for the important showdown. West Chester State is one of the best
teams Pitt annually faces and this game should be indicative of the
caliber of this year's soccer team. ‘ 
“They are a very well conditioned, tough bunch of kids,” Bemis
remarked. “They are all good physical specimens and good soccer
players.” . . -  ' 
What Bemis may’very well be referring to is the fact that We V‘
Chester State IS primarily a school for physical education majorsanjd

when the pace of the game is considered.

In last year‘s contest the major factor in the_Pitt defeat was that
the West Chester squad displayed ‘unusually strong stamina. As the

back again. Although finishing
with an 8-5 slate, West Chester
finished the ’71 campaign on a
very strong note that included a
2-1 win over Army.

West Chester will also feature a
veteran forward line to go along
with their bruising style of play.
The Panthers will counter with a
seasoned defensive unit that does-
n’t give in very easily.

Bemis has not decided who will
start in goal, with senior Steve Fi-
bel and junior Bill Haines battling.
Haines recorded a shutout last
weekend at Bucknell, but was
never really tested with a hard
direct kick.

Joe Luxbacher, who picked up
two assists against the Bisons,
leads the list of definite starters.
Other teammateswho will join
Luxbacher are Gary Midock, Den-
ny Kohlmeyer and Fernando Car-
