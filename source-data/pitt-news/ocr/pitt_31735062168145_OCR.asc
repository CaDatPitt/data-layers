Wed. March Launchs Tea

by SANDY DeVIRGILIO
Staff Writer

Several hundred persons, wear-
ing surgical masks and carry-
ing burlap bags for garbage,
marchedfrom Flagstaff Hill in
a. “March for Life” Wednesday
morning. ‘

The walk to Duquesne Uni-
versity launched a four-day En-
vironmental Teach-In designed to

A i acquaint people with the prob-

lems of pollution in advanced
technology.

Folksinger Don McLean be-
gan the morning’s activities,
singing to a crowd of about 100.
The number of spectators in-.

_ creased as.McLean presented his

repertoire of songs about Ameri-
ca and it's ruin through, exploi-
tation.

. McLean stopped several times
because of microphone trouble
finally deciding to sing without
it.

His voice /was sometimes lost
asa result of winds and the nois-
es of, the crowd, but he was fav- »
orably received. .

The young singer. who is ac-
tive. in the fight against. pollu-

. .A tion. encouraged the crowd to

sing along on "This Land is

‘ Your Land". and "This Light of
, ’Mine".
A -   McLean ended "his program at

ed to several hundred. ’_

. pipers.

Students carrying the banner,
“Military Budget Cut: Funds Di-
verted To Environment. APRIL
FOOL!” followed the bagpip-
ers.

Marchers were kept in line by
marshalls chosen from the
crowd. City policemen directed
«the walk across intersections and
along parts of Forbes. Avenue
without sidewalks. '

Along the route. marchers car-
rying _burlap bags often left the
ranks to pick up bit of paper.
cans, and other debris which lay
along the sidewalks.

‘The Schenley ‘High School
track team ran along side the
marchers, clapping their. hands
and shouting, ‘fsmoke, smoke”.

WIXZ disc jockeys‘ followed
the march on motor bikes. wear-
ing superman shirts and sporting
green Environmental Teach-In
buttons, The WIXZ mobile studio
served as a sounddunit for the
entire march. '

While crossing one . of » the
streets in the Hill District. mar-

_ chers encountered a pile of dirt

and paper lying_ beside the curb.
A youth anchored a sign on top
of the pile with a bar of rusted
metal. "Earth +'Love it or Leave
it." '

When the-group ~-turned off

Forbes to..the Duquesne camp-

us, the WIXZ -vehicle, parked
along the side, began broadcast-

' ing a Tom Lehrer routine about

pollution: “Don’t drink-the wat-

. er _and don’.t.breathe- the air.”

 marchers arrived at the
Duquesne ’ Student Union about

David Marshall. coordinator
of the Pittsburgh Environmental
Teach-In. briefly addressed the

_ group. urging a small number of

people to attend the City Coun-
cil meeting then in progress.

City Council Meeting

The matter before the Council
was the relocation of residents
of the East St. Valley, the pro-
posed site for Interstate High-
"way 79.

In a letter to all marchers.
coordinator ,Marshall stated.
"We have little to say on the
sitting of a jetport in the Ever-
glades or the-exploitation of the
oil reserves of the North Slope
of Alaska, with all the indiffer-
ence to the vulnerability- of the
ecology of these areas that such
decisions imply. But here is a
local issue. concerning people
we know, our neighbors and
friends. onour own turf."

A group of about fifty per-
sons walked to the City-County
Building,
ten-. The Teach-In did not ‘have
a parade permit for the_ area
from Duquesne
County Building.
, Some of the marchers were
prevented from entering Coun-
cil chambers. _due to lack of
space. Those who were allowed
in sat on desks and steps around
the chamber. Most of the seats

were taken by residents of East

St. , V

The Hon. Joseph‘F. Bonetto,'
member of the General Assem-,

problems the residents found in

leaving the units of

Gil Borquin, V vice-president of

Secretary, Health, Education,

Talley expressed his fears that

ey also stressed the possible 

pact of hasty action on society.

"Our society is probably as
fragile as the ecological system
of which it is apart,” he said.

In summary, the HEW Secre-
tary urged the audience to re-
view the complexity of the prob-
lem of pollution before acting.

“Match ‘your efforts to the

Both Allegheny County and the
Pittsburgh Port Authority turned
down as “not feasible in the near
future” a plan proposed by The
Commuter Association to reduce
bus rates for University commu-
ter students.

County Commissioner Leonard
Staisey and Harold Geissenheim-
er. Port Authority Director of
Planning,
Association representatives at
an informal dinner Tuesday
night at the University to dis-
cuss commuter student transpor-
tation problems. Both_ men cited
the County’s inability to absorb
the. loss of revenue reduced stu-
dent fares would cause as the
primary obstruction to The Com-
muter Association’s plan.

Commissioner .- Staisey explain-
ed that the reason the-question
had been bounced back and
forth between the Port Author-
ity and the County‘Commission-
ers was that the County must
give approval ‘before the Port
Authority can incur debts. Theo-
retically, the Port Authorityis
independent from the County
but it is not, in fact, financial-
ly self-sustaining. Allegheny
County must absorb much of ‘the
expense for public transit. ' 0

Assistant Dean of ‘Students,
Chentis Pettigrew. Advisor to
The Commuter Association, told
the officials that the group hop-

 

ed the County. would agree to

subsidize commuting student bus
.gfares due to I the predominant
number of commuters who are
‘county ‘residents. The Associa-
'tion’s basic objective, would be
to lower the standard $10.50
wrionthly bus‘ pass to $6.00 for
 commuting students. ~‘

spokesman Gissenheimer stated.
“I was a subway commuter. or
"underground student" at New
York University a few years
back. "However, from the Port
Authority’s dollar and cent view-
point, we simply cannot afford
to reduce commuting students
fares at this time. "

Unlike Senior Citizens, com-
muting students could not easi-
ly make use of reduced fares
during non-rush hours.

Commissioner said. "The Coun-
ty’s only sources of revenue are
millage taxes on real estate and

have available are simply not
sufficient to coversuch a plan
at this time.“

by JOY MANDEL
Staff Writer

After many months of unful-
filled promises to solve the park-
ing problem ‘and get the com-
muter involved, the Commuter
Association, led by President
Paul Hensler, has finally taken
some action toward definite
goals. During the past three
months, research has been under-
way in different areas.

THE COMMUTER ASSOCIATION has announced that transit shelters smilior to the one pictured above will be .

erected o_n Forbes and Fifth Aves. outside the Student Union‘. Designed b
ed glass-and-steel structures are scheduled to be built by September.

feasibility for reduced rates for '

fact that increased ridership 5

Commissioner Staisey explain-

the loss of revenue from decreas-
ed bus fares for commuting stu-
dents, would make the losses the

In New York City, a bra-less young wom-
an walking through the downtown area suddenly
becomes enraged at the hundreds of magazines
with nude, erotic, or model head shots of some
of the members of her species, displayed on ev-

ery newstand, and formulates some plan -as to »

get even with the persons responsible for them
being there. ' ’

In Watts, a teen-aged black watches his
fathers last shreds of dignity fall under the re-
lentless questioning of a welfare agent, and he
wonders will his family ever be able to get
away from the stench, the heartache, the disap-
pointment, the . . . . . everything that goes with
the word ghetto. And he starts investigating into
how to make a molatov cocktail.

John Crow, a full-blooded American Indian
stands on a‘hillside. In one direction he sees
the great land in which he should have inherit-
ed, and in the other direction he sees the little
plot of land which has become his people’s
home. And he thinks about the phrase “Red
Power”, and he walks down from the hill toward
his stolen great land.

Black and White college and highschool
students with afros and long unkempt hair,
stand in a long registration line, and they look
at their proposed new schedules; shaking their
heads they contemplate just how many people
could fit into the Chancellors office, and how
much damage they could do if he doesn’t listen
to them.

Mr. Brock, a 67 year old retired construction
worker, finally felled by a bad back, goes to the
mailbox hoping that maybe his social security
check has arrived. But after opening it he finds
that he still would be in the same financial pre-
dicament had it not come at all. And he breaks
down into tears, for he knows that it would do
the aged no good, to even try and organize to
cause people to know that people like him do
really exist.

In a nearby Army base, the soldiers march
in orderly fashion over. to the base barber
shops, and they get their hair closely cropped
and their inklings of beards and mustaches done)
away with. And they wonder what the barber
has to do with" their ability to kill. And they
wonder about that action verb; to kill. And
they march as they gave been taught, but this
time to see the general, or Canada.

The power structureargues that America’s

Oscar Wilde once wrote (in paraphrase),
“In America, the President reigns for four years,
but journalism rules forever.” The print media
has also been called the fourth branch of gov-
ernment.

Both sources have a point.

FREEDOM OF THE PRESS is an explicit
constitutional right; a staple of
the Bill of Rights. Freedom to
criticize the press is an implicit
constitutional right, also a staple
. of the Bill of Rights.

 But those who attack the press
f for irresponsibility often invite
the same charge.

The most frequent dart levied
against journalists involves their lack of “objec-
tivity.” The print communicator must be totally
objective, claim their chief critics, is, they must
be mere mechanical instruments transmitting in-
formation. a

   

BETTER THIS INDICTMENT be aimed
at editors who hire human beings rather than
computers. If events happened of themselves,
the charge would be justified -l— responsible.

But the true journalist is concerned with
causes, not effects; and the precipitators of
events, in all cases, are people. .

Thus it takes a “people” to understand this;
it takes a “people”lwho understands emotional
response to transcribe the emotional -responses
of others. A computer could only list; it could
not evaluate, interpret and amalgamate.

EVEN A SUPERFICIAL look at the thought
processes of any human being betrays the fall-
acy that he can be objective.

Journalism is not objective; it can not be ob-
jective; it does not purport to.be objective.

Before one can venture a criticism -of the
press,'tha_t basic truth must be understood.

Fairness is another concept, a concept'that
cangbe ‘achieved; a concept that only too often

 the password of the true journalism; it 

categorizes his contribution to society." Its basis
lies in responsibility.

HERE IS WHERE CRITICS of the press

meet its defenders on even ground.

For this writer, journalistic responsibility
requires, in a particular context, background re-
search, clarity of the “facts” and analysis. Rath- .
er than pretend to non-bias, journalists should
admit their biases and permit their readership
the benefit of their experiences and their in-

A telligence.

(Editor's Note: This letter was written to George Schultz,
Secretary of the Department of Labor, with copies sent to Gov- T
ernor Raymond Shafer, and Senators Hugh Scott and Richard?‘
Schweiker. l t is a formal complaint.)

Dear Mr. Schultz:

The University Committee for Women’s Rights of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has worked deligently for approximately three
months to obtain data concerning salaries and all other relevant
information necessary to scientifically analyze the problem of
discrimination at this University.

The University Committee for Women’s Rights had available
for such a study a Ph.D. statistician with five years experience In
employee analysis and several Ph.D. level experimental psycholo-
gists. .
The response of the University has been only promises to
supply the data followed by a succession of changing excuses as
to why they would not do so. The following table grossly sums
up the situation at the University of Pittsburgh.

Percentage of Women in Administrative and Faculty Positions

University of Pittsburgh .. !_§~

Chancellor 0 percent
Vice'Chancellor 0 percent -
Academic Dean 13 percent
Department Head 7 percent
Professor 3 percent
Associate Professor 9 percent
Assistant Professor ‘ 17 percent
Instructor 31 percent
Lecturer 25 percent
Undesignated Rank 25 percent

    

‘It should be noted that these figures show a lower percen-
tage of women in the top faculty levels than the national average
for all universities and is even lower than the average for the
twenty leading universities (1960 figures). '

Nor does the discrimination directed toward women end at
the top level‘ University Positions. Different job classifications
with differential salaries are often given men as opposed to wom-
en according to reports from several staff members. 

The awarding of fellowships to graduate‘ students is another"
area requiring scrutiny. Forexample, in the University of Pitts-
burgh History Department, the teaching fellowships which pay

$300 more than teaching assistantships are heavily weighted with
males \(20 men to three women) while the lower paying teaching

assistantships-are distributedto 7 males and 8 females (‘1969-70).

Because graduate study is the academic fo_rrn._of apprentice-
ship it is crucial that the policy of nondiscrimination required
by the executive orders be instituted immediately. ' ' .

'Another critical ‘area of discrimination is that of admissions.

' In‘ American medical Schools there is. a well-known quota sys-
tem" restricting the number ‘of women admitted to 7, per cent or

less. ‘

The recent figures from the University of Pittsburgh Medi_- ,.
cal School are congruent with ‘a quota system. The percentages?”
of women in this professional training program is 7 percent. '’

Even worse, the percentage of women medical students in
1966-70 sank to '3 percent. The fact’ that women accepted into
Medical School over the years have had somewhat -higher objec- »
tive qualifications than the male students strongly implies a dis-
criminatory bias in the selection procedure.

When practices like these are permitted to exist freely, they
are reflected in the psychological and social aspects of Academ-
ic Life as well, so that women are discouraged by advisors and

‘ faculty from aspiring to higher education andiin some cases ‘

women report that they have been demoted for complaining about
discrimination. , _ - — . = n

V_ I expect that you will be convinced of the need for imme-
diate and effective action by the Federal Government. The at-
tempts by the University Committee for Women’s Rights to work
with the Administration to discover and eliminate areas of seg;
discrimination have failed and thus wasted time. 1 ' ”’°’

Of" course there is no real way to compensate the women

whose careers have been stunted or destroyed over the last 50

or 100 years. But at least women have a right to expect that ex-
isting executive orders be enforced so that thesepractices do not
continue for even one more year. ' '

The University of Pittsburgh receives many grants from Fed-
eral Agencies and thus the Federal Government is ‘actually sub-
sidizing discrimination against women.

We demand not only the elimination of present discrimina-
tory practices. but affirmative action such as child centers, avail-
ability of part time study.programs and a large number of scho-
larships for women in areas where they are currently excluded
or restricted. “ . i ‘

In addition to the ymany promotions which will‘ be needed
to place women in the positions which they would no doubt
have attained had the system been truly ‘free, it will be necessary
to eliminate policies of secrecy of salary scales and pers_onn.e<@si~"

\

- records which work against any group receiving discriminatory

treatment.

-Furthermore, fullscale and sincere recruiting efforts must
be instituted to attract women into professional life.

It is ironic that this plea for “law and order” from the op-
pressed majority has to be _made to the current administration
in view of campaign promises.

At the University of Pittsburgh women observe that the
Blacks have achieved at least a beginning towa_rd most of the.
goals of full and equal participationin University Life which are
now being denied women. ~ »

-“ by SCOTT BAUM

Outgoing Student Government
President

“Well, we knew it would hap-

Vpen, and so it has. The pressure

built up by faculty and students
pushing for educational reform had
to show somewhere..It isn't odd
that the first serious casualty of the
ongoing reform dispute is in the
Chemistry Dept. The hierarchy of
that department never took well to
David Schumacher and his radical

—ideas about education.”

2*-=

.9;

This comment, recently over-
heard. is at least partially cor-
rect. Those of us who have been
involved in educational reform
here at Pitt have known Dr_._Da-
vid Schumacher as one who both
preaches educational reform and
practices it.

In fact. he has taken the risk of
creating a Chem 80 course in
which students choose their own
tracks: they are apparently very
interested in what they are doing.

(The latter was determined by the
deceptively simple empirical de-
vice of observing how many stu-
dents show up for a section which
has no tests nor mandatory atten-
dance.)

"So. what's the problem?" you
ask naively.

The problem is that Dr. Schu-

_macher has been denied tenure in

the Chemistry Department here.
That means. no job security and
no salary increases.

It is essentially tantamount to
dismissal. True. it is not dismiss-
al in the sense of relief of duty.
but Dr. Schumacher cannot come
up for tenure again.

If he stays at Pitt he will never
have the job security and bene-
fits of tenure——a situation not like-
ly to entice him to stay. '

POLITICAL ACT 
It is implicit that the denial of

‘tenure was a political act. not a

judgment of academic compe-
tence. Let me recount the factors
which ostensibly led to the deci-

sion to deny Dr. Schumachers
tenure.

But first I must confess a bias.
The information here is the re-
sult of discussions with Dr. Schu-
macher himself. Although I am
I content to accept his word. others
perhaps. Dr. Wallace. chairman
of the Chem Department. might
wish to dispute what I have to say.

—One of the objections to the
granting of tenure to Dr. Schu-
macher is his teaching record.
There has been no overwhelming
indication of his ability as a teach-
er as measured by student feed-
back to the chairman of the de-
partment.

He received only average 15's
and 6's) ratings on the 1968 stu-
dent evaluation. Additionally —
some students have even com-
plained about Dr. Schumacher’s
teaching.

In reviewing the past year of
FAS meetings and other meetings
regarding student involvement.
and educational reform. I don’t
recall the Chemistry Department
(with a few notable exceptions.
including. of course. Dr. Schu-
macher) to have been a ‘crusad-
ing force in the battle for better
teaching.

This is particularly true when
student input is involved in any
decision making. If recent tenure

I decisions in the Chem. Dept. could

be examined. it would be found
that student responses about good
or poor teaching in the past have
not been as crucial a factor as
they apparently have been in Dr.
Schumacher’s case.

EVALUATION SHADY

But. let us assume for the mo-
ment that this procedure of using
teacher evaluations as an impor-
tant factor in tenure decisions
represents a new trend in Chem.
Department thinking.

None the less,.to use the 1968
student guide as an index of good
teaching is patently absurd. It is
generally conceded that it was a
good try. but actually a very poor

.;......».s.............. .......u.......

evaluation mechanism. It really
indicated very little about teach-
ing ability (how else could Dean
of Faculty Rosenberg. then teach-
ing chemistry. and from all re-
ports teaching it well. receive 25
and 3’s on the evaluation scale? ).

SCOTT BAUM, former SG president.

Further. evaluation was by con-

:sent of the instructor. so’ that

many a poor teacher, even in the
Chemistry Department. escaped
evaluation altogether.

The inequity of using this eval-
uation as a factor in tenure deci-
sions is further compounded by
the fact that none of the junior fac-
ulty were informed that the '68
evaluation was to be used for that
purpose.

As for complaints about teach-
ing. Dr. Schumacher tells me that

he was never informed of these
complaints before the tenure de-
cision was made. ‘

The question then stands. how
did the Chemistry Department
ascertain that Dr. Schumacher is
not considered a good teacher by
his students.

RESEARCH INADEQUATE

The second major factor in the
decision to deny tenure is. appar-
ently, the inadequacy of Dr. schn-
macher’s research. I admit I
know little about research in
chemistry, but I do know that Dr.
Schumachers grants for research
were maintained. with depart-

mental approval, for a five year

period.

It is strange that he was never
informed that his research was
below par or in the wrong areas.
And all this when money is rela-

A tively scarce and only choice re-
. search projects recieve funds.

David Schumacher is one of
those faculty indispensable to the
University.’

He experiments. he innovates.
and most importantly he is very

individuals and how they are -

 

taught. He would truly be a loss a —. 

for those concerned with reform-

ing the educational process at Pitt. 

_ I have brought to your attention
only one aspect of this problem.

AMAVERICK
Dr. Schumacher’s personal po-
litical beliefs. as opposed to his

educational beliefs. are not con- ‘i 
sonant with those ‘of most of his S c 

colleagues.

This also may have been a part
of the decision to deny him ten-'

- ure.

If those of us who are concern- I 

ed with educational reform allow
this decision to go uncommented ,

upon we cannot expect that junior  

faculty will fight for this reform

at the risk of denial of tenure. '

Quaker, what do

you do if
someone
punches your

kid brother?

Stop him. Same as anyone
would. But the guy who
punches a Quaker’s kid
brother—or anyone else’s—
must be blocked, not counter-
punched. Why? Because vio-
lence begets violence. And
if someone doesn't stop re-
taliating, the violence esca-
lates. Friends believe that a
Jesus who preached, “Turn
the other cheek” brought a
sanity which can save man-
kind. Or a man.

And if you think that
nations are different . . .

from people, watch carefully
as violence escalates in world
affairs. Friends believe that
it is vital that we live “in
the virtue of that life and
power that takes away the
occasion of all wars.” Or a
punch in the nose for your
brother. Only thencan de-
esoalation—and brotherhood
—set in.

Is peace simply something to

We avoid our own meditation.
the churning of our own hearts.
The fad is an invitation not to
be held down by Buddha. Krish-
na. Christ, or what be. but to
rise up to the spirit of all of
these: to shun phoniness and un-
cover the shame. the manipulat-
ing-others, the being satisfied
with what we are. the "sitting
back" as in fat capitalists imper-
ialist — to shun these, to uncov-
er the sham and burn it with
courage and decision.

countless possibilities and alter-
natives for living in both! I

it's with your body. le.e. cum-

not to relate and cherish. to play

you move . . . never to say. stop
this goddamn game what doyou-

It's love imperialist-style: what
we feel. think. believe. want.
hope. love is SLAVE to the sys-
tem. based naturally on oppres-

sion? And to do this we can live
on top of eachother or exist in-
hibited distances apart. as it
were liberal or conservative. No
straight road. only an honest one.

Let's carry the revolution to
the pelvis! If we only have love
then tomorrow will dawn.

$$$$$ — Where your heart is
there also will your treasure be.
(Jesus The Carpenter) Of all
creatures we are the poorest and
the most incomplete; our needs
are always beyond what we can

La grande betrayal!

We are obsessed with buying
and collecting. and willing to
squeeze the last drop of life out
of our petty materialism. our
stereos. nice cars. and expen-
sive wardrobes.

We're afraid to be poor. to
tell someone were needy. We
feel we have enough and so we
never really meet eachother.
and the beat goes on!

A Hollow Honor

Editor. The Pitt News:

Last week I was tapped for
membership in‘ Pi Delta Epsilon
fraternity to "recognize my con-
tribution to campus journalism.”
I cannot accept this award. I

I didn’t make a fast decision. I

thought about it. I asked some of '

my friends what they thought.

Okay, sure, honoraries really '

don’t do anything, but takevthe
looks good

Yeh._ having an honorary on
your list looks good, especially
when you have a low QPA. (Like I
do. ) It might even make the differ-
ence between getting into grad
school or not.

Well. the way I see it. it might
make the difference. But I’m still
not going to-take it. The things
that made an impression to me
about honoraries is that they tell
you where ' you can make your
check payable to in the letter tell-
ing you that you’re in. .

And the fact is that if someone
you know is in one. ‘you‘ll be tap-
ped. And what do they do besides

fgtake your 20 or 30 bucks and in

‘*:r’6turn give you a" name to put
down on your listof activities.
’ And .one other thing, if you
think that these honoraries look

’ over‘_'the people on campus and

see who is really deserving of an
_,award for doing a good job—-
you’re wrong.

_ 5lVlaybe with me little- things
make an impression. I feel that if

I 6
5

you’re going to make an award
to someone for doing a good job.
you check out the people you're
considering and find out just what
they’ve done and interview them
and maybe spell their name right
on the initiation letter yousend
them.

I will not be initiated into an
honorary that knows nothing about
me and that I know nothing about.

They don‘t care who really de-
serves to be honored.

Whenever I’ve been in the Hill-

minutes before 'it closes .a uni-
formed guard begins yelling,
"closing time.”

He can be heard throughout the I

entire building as he travels from
the top to the ground floor.

On the ground floor, one guard
in particular never seems satis-
fied with the progress of egres
sion from the building and often
resorts to shouting comments to
students, a typical one being, “are
you deaf or somet’ing?”

These comments generally be-
gin about 1O minutes before the
actual closing time and continue
until the last individual is "chas-
ed” out.- . -I

Art’s Praise  
‘Unpraised’

Dear Mr. Rosenberg,

As a student of theatre and a

worker in the Pitt theatre group.
. for two years and as a member of

the opening night audience of Ros-
encrantz and Guildenstern, I
found your praise of this produc-
tion extravagant, unfounded and
difficult to believe.

"Ponderous,” a word you used
in your review to state what R.
and G. was not, is my verdict ex-
actly.

The main point with which I
take serious issue is your lavish
praise of Dr. Curtis Canfield’s di-
rection. Granted, his credits are
impressive, but I trust that our
analysis of his work is to be found-
ed on the present and not the past.

Your simple definition of the
director’s task "for those who
don’t know the role” will serve us
well enough. for it is precisely
where Dr. Canfield fails. There is
no life in what happens on Foster

' stage; R. and G; is dead.

Except for Nemitz and brief
flashes from Frezza, R. and G.
has all the movement of a series
ofturnpike billboards, all the sus-

I pense of reaching the next turn- '

pike exit, and all the excitement
of getting there. It is a tedious
drive to an expected ‘end. ’

The actors do not move, except
from the head; it is a production
of flapping mouths and hollow
souls. What you refer to as ‘‘flow’’

is merely the foreward movement I

of a well-oiled machine; what you
so casually dub “timing” is mere-
ly tight cueing. ‘
Do you recognize the differ-
ence? Do you realize that the only
value of a machine-gun barrage
of lines is to make an audience
have serious doubts as to whether
anything is happening inside these
actors. these people?
“Inspiration”? 1 found little.
"Invention"? Of a cool, clinical
sort—not my taste. “Feeling”?

Tom Spinella picked his nose with ,

conviction. Kudoes to him.

.R. and G. is “intelligent,” po-
tentially "brilliant” theatre, but
not as Dr. Canfield has conceived
it. If you cared about these peo-
ple (which is essential in my opin-

ion), it is not because of what the ‘

director put out, but because of T
the tremendous amount of feeling
you put in.

An audience deserves more

, than that; they deserve more than

a parade of cardboard cutouts
for their evening in the theatre.

The Senate. with only one dis-
senting vote. recently passed
what's known as the Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968. This bill reverses
the three major Supreme Court
decisions: Miranda, Mallory and
Wade.

Further. it permits the presi-

I dent. without any safeguards at

all. to order secret surveillance
of any person or group that in
his opinion poses a threat to
the "structure or existence of the
government." (Stand when your
name is called.)

BUGGING ALLOWED

This law also permits the
Attorney General. United States
Attorneys and local district at-
torneys to tap or bug anyone
who has committed. is committ-
ing. or is about to’corfimit‘ a

crime punishable by a year or.
more in; jail. as_long as a judge ..

' ticials to. bug or tap for 48 hours
without a judge's permission i_f”‘
they decide that an "emergenc_V" L

exists — the definition of emer-
gency is left up tothem. ’

During the debate‘ in the Sen-
ate over this bill. only four Sen-
ators opposed it; theywere: Hart.’
Kennedy. Goodell a-nd Sam Ervin
of North Cafrolinav.

Conspicuous in their approval
of the bill were Javitts. McCar-
thy. and those other bums who
call themselves "liberals."

Of course. you know that the
“No-Knock Law” was passed.

  

This gives the police the right
to burst into any premises with-
out warning if they can convince
a judge that such a warning
would result in the destruction
of evidence.

How long will it be before
agents burst into the homes of
dissenters. contending that to an-
nounce themselves could result

WHAT'S DANGEROUS
What most everyone missed was

or perhaps. even. explo-

that the_ day after the l“‘No-_

Knock v'B_i,_ll_?’. was passed the

House Subcommittee on the Dis--~

In case you're confused. yes.

that is a preventive detention_

measure. and it does eliminate
the presumption of innocence.

That same day the House resur- A
rected. by a vote of 274 to 65. ‘
‘the program of barring “sub-’

versives" t'rom working inde-

fense plants. overturning a long-'_

standing Supreme5Court deci-
sion. . -

Among other provisions of

this measure. it allows defense

   
   

,_ with the

plant employees to be fired
without confronting their ac-
cuser. if a federal official de-
cides that disclosure of the ac-
cuser would be "harmful to’
national security."

There's also pending a fed-
eral detention law that would
allow a judge to hold a suspect
without bail for up to 60 days
if the judge thought the person
was guilty. if he thought the
person might commit another
crime while out on ball. or if
judge thought the release of the
suspect would prove dangerous
to the community

ISMS

It's not dejas—vus: the passage
of these laws and some others.
coupled with the behavior of po-
lice and government officials.
is McCarthyism. Stalinism. Naz-
ism and Fascism all over again.

I've only‘been able to find
four newspapermen who've dealt
issue of theselaws:
Tom Wicker New York Times,

‘Nat Hentoff Village Voice, Rich-.
mtriet of Columbia’ approved a pro-_," "
{posal that permits .Wasf1ington,: '
'D’.:_'C. Judges to _jail_ "dan'ger—.t.
,-ou‘-s‘-' criminal suspects" for up to.
.60 days-before trial.‘ ' . 

ard Harris New Yorker,’ and Mike

Royko Chicago Daily N ews. I
_. ' But what’s even more disturb- :

ing is that the Legal’ Establish-

; ment, the _many lawyers’-' com-
' mittees on what-have-you. should

be screaming from the rooftops .
about these laws. i

Instead. they‘are waiting for
the Supreme Courtto overturn
them a year or two from nowa-
a Supreme Court that'll feature

‘Berger. Carswell. and other not-:

ed civil libertarians.

Thd country moves toward a
police state. and as Tom Wicker
said recently. the silence from
the Bar is deafening. A

A razor blade can give you

a good, close-shave on the easy
parts of your face.

A Like_ your cheeks. Because
your cheeks are almost flat,
like a razor blade. ' '

But what about the hard-

to-shave parts of your face?

Feel your neck  

. Feel how your beard grows
down on part of your neck? And
up on’ another part? (Some
beards even grow sideways.)

To give you a close,
comfortable shave on your
neck", we designed the Norelco
Tripleheader with 18 self-
sharpening rotary blades that
shave in every,direction.

If you think

you’re getting a great    
shave with a razor blade,  
    feel your face.

Feel your chin

The Norelco Tripleheader has

3 Microgroovem shavingheads ’

that float to follow the cu.rvesj

(In independent tests, tné  = ,-
Trlpleheader shaved as close for" 

closer than a stainless steel

The hard thing about shaving {

Again, the unique Norelco V

design lets you maneuver

around your nose andmouth,

In an effort to sample student
opinion of these proposals the
Pitt News interviewed a number
of Pitt students.

Talking to students whacked
out on the floor of the Union.
students daring hemorrhoid
complications by sitting on ce-
ment benches. students feeding
the rats in the Commons Room.
and one scholar whose only com-
ment was that he was pissed-off.
was depressing because only a
small number of -them were
aware of the proposed changes
in the grading system.

The. majority of students ques-
tioned were infavor of the chan-
ges, once they understood- what
was involved. Georgine Fitz,
freshman, Political Science——It’s
a good idea. There are a lot of
subjects you want to take and
you can’t because of the grade.
You could take subjects you
were interested in if your maj-
or subjects were the only ones
you receive a grade in, '.
- Albert Richards. sophomore.
Economics——I think it’s all right
because too much pressure is put
on students for good grades.

Gene Sobolcik, freshman. Bi-
ology—I think the credit-no en-

try system is good because it giv-
es the student a better chance
to concentrate on his ‘major with-
out worrying about other unrelat-
ed fields.

Karen Wehner, Freshman, Pol-
itical Science -— It’s a good idea
because you get a chance to take
all the courses you want. You can
pay more attention to your maj-

or subjects. I hope it goes

' through.

Albert Wynn. freshman. Poli-,

tical Science — I go along with ‘

these changes because they will
eliminate pressures that make
education a chore. More educa-
tion will be accomplished in-
stead of trying to please teach-

And then there were the wary.

Emma F. Qualls. freshman.
Psychology —- It sounds good.
but it will probably entail a lot
of complications. It's almost too
complexin a school this size. I
ran into a lot of problems with
the S-L’ system‘. Instead. I would
like to see them do away with
distribution.

Michael Koricich, junior, Poli-
tical Science — Why not just take
the grade? I would like to
change the S-U system to pass-

fail. This credit-no entry sys- '

tern doesn’t give any criteria for‘

grad school. Grad schools look .

at your overall work, too, and
they won’t revise their review-
‘ing to accommodate Pitt stu-
dents. I think a lot of kids will
use this as .a cop-out. In fact,
this is only being proposed be-
cause of student pressure.

Al Crawford. junior — I don‘t
think grades mean a thing. There
are too many inconsistencies in
the grading. This is not bad. but
you knock out incentive. One’ of
the good points is that it gives
students a nice option.

Richard Dunsheath. sophomore.

Chemistry — I think credit-no

entry is good. but it will raise

everyone's PA so high that if
you don't-get a 3.9. you're in
trouble. «
The Pitt News,also questioned
people outside of the College of

Arts and Sciences to hear their

reactions.’;‘;.

Dan Nowak, senior, Engineer-
ing— In the case of Liberal
Arts this system "would lower
standards. There is nothing to
judge competence on. It re-
moves the grade incentive and
leaves nothing to strive for.
This doesn’t affect engineers
at all and I’m glad because
it would be a disaster to in-
stitute this in the School of
Engineering,‘ 1

Victor Kovach. sophomore. En-

gineering -3 I would like to see

Brian Earley. sophomore. Eng-

jor is all important.

Fred Stoner, freshman—I think it’s
a good system because I like
learning for learning’s sake.

Louis Landro, junior, Speech
Science-1 am in favor of the
newly proposed system.‘,‘. -.

Marcus Zolnier. freshman. Bio-'

physical —'I think it’s a fine

Richard B. Alpert. junior- Eng-

What conclusions may be
drawn from this smattering of
opinion‘? --Obviously. there is a
break-down of

between those making decisions.
and. those whose educations are
being affected by such decisions.

Democrat from Philadelphia
running for Hugh Scott's LIS.
Senate seat. spoke to a small
group of students on March 31.
in the Student Union.

..Previously. Mr. Reece was the
manager of the Pennsylvania pre-
sidential campaign of Senator
Eugene J. ’l\/,IcCarthy. and he

. has helped manage Pennsylvan-
ia campaignsfor Johnson-Hum- .

phrey. Joseph S: Clark. and Mil-

ton Shapp.

The discussion. started with Mr.
Reece maintaining the right to
strike of the essential services.
He said that the strike is a use-
ful tool of the people. but should
be used only-where all other re-

courses have failed. Wage-price"

increases. stated Reece. are per-
haps the only way we can alle-
viate strikes.

A "prompt end to the war”
with an "immediate troop with-
drawal". stated Mr.,Reece. is the
only way to treat the problem.
President .\'ixon's policy of Viet-
namization. "Seems only to be
a continuity of the war." said
Reece. "I have continually ask-
ed. ‘Why are we in the war'." to
presidential aide. Henry Kissin-
ger. and have not received ‘a
suitable answerﬁf stated Reece.

The candidate said that through"

our attacks on North. Vietnam.
and our continued stay in South

ivietnam. we may be drawing
the Vietnamese people closer to

the Chinese "we may be de-

feating ourselves. “

I In reference to the Wars ef- N

feet on the economy. Mr. Reece
said. "There is no difficulty in
transplanting a wartime economy
into a peacetime economy. It

was done after \V'.W.II. and the

entire country enjoyed an era
of unparalled prosperity”. _"Ap-
proximately one third of
money spent in Vietnam would
build five hundred thousand
homes for multiple
areas". said Reece.

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

The newly-created Course Ev-
aluation Committee is currently
conducting an evaluation of all
courses in the College of Arts
and Sciences. Committee co-
chairmen Rudy Potenzone and
Lynne Goldberg hope to publish
the results of their survey in a
book that will be available free
of cost in the fall to all students.

"Our book.” explained Poten-
zone," will contain two sec-
tions. The first section will in-

 clude statistical information such
“ as the number of students res-

ponding and the breakdown of
their responses. The second sec-
tion will be devoted to comments
offered by the students about

. their courses and teachers.”

The committee initiated its
survey by mailing a question-
naire to all University students.
Students are asked to respond
to 27 questions dealing with the
classes and instructors they had
during the winter term. Ans-
wers to 25 of the questions are
to be graded along a one to five
scale, while the remaining ques-
tions require only a "yes” or
"no” reply. Ample space is also
provided for students to ana-

iiil-yze their courses in their own

words.

To facilitate collection of the
data, the committee planned to
include with the questionnaire
and instructions six IBM
cards, on which students were
requested ‘to write their ans-
wers. Because of a misunder-
standing in the Mailing Depart-
ment, however, most students
have received only one card.

Thoughuncertain of the exact
cause of the mix-up, Potenzone

- announced that the other five
, gcards would be mailed to stu-
‘ ”"“dents in a matter of days. Com-

pleted cards should be deposit-
ed in one of the drop-off boxes,

 Course Evaluation

which are located at the Tow-
ers Lobby, the Student Union
desk, the ground floor of the
Cathedral, and at the desk of
each of the women’s dorms.

Any student who does not re-
ceive the additional five» cards
should secure them from the
Student Government office on
the third floor of the Student
Union.

The‘movie, adapted by Jerzy

Hoffman from Henryk Sienkie-
wicz’s popular novel of the.
same title. premiered several
months ago in Poland.

Pan Wolodyjowski is the third
part of Sienkiewicz’s Trilogy,
which depicts the XVII_th cen-
tury in Poland, the so—called
"century of wars”: Cossack,
Swedish, Russian and Turkish.
Pan Wolodyjowski is concerned
with the last of the century’s
wars and with the Ottoman Em-

Commenting on the film, Pro-
fessor Frank Mocha of the Sla-
vic Languages Department de-
clared that "the film remains
very faithful to the novel.” He

 ~ went on to explain the meaning

p of the movie as he perceived it.

“From the Baroque splendor
of the Polish capital, the view-

_ the Ukraine
where -a titanic struggle is in

-er is taken to the wild and re- ..
..,,..... mote steppes of

the process of unfolding, cul-
minating in the heroic defense
of the Kamieniec fortress in P0-
dolia. For those who enjoy them,
the
scenes of horsemanship. swords-
manship, and human resourceful-
ness displayed by both the male
and female protagonists.

"Next to the scenes of war,
the film paints a picture of mor-
als and _manners of the times. It
tells a story of heroic deeds. but
also of strong and unrestrained

passions. It shows depths of hat- -
red and cruelty unknown in the .

West, but also of love. and gen-
erosity.

"Above all, it is a story of

self-sacrifice. of which people of —

the -era were capable. Those
who have read Sienkiewicz. or
are familiar_with hisnovel, will
have an additional gratification
in discovering that the film’s
version does not depart from
their own vision of the world
which the Polish writer has cre-
ated in his work.”

uestio ned

by POHLA SMITH

’ Staff Writer
After a delay that nearly caus-
ed .a financial catastrophe. the

’ State Legislature appropriated
" $37,899.000 to Pitt by House Bill
- No.1520.

Nearly $37 million of this is de-

' I signated to be used for resident

education. This sum was calcul-

 . ated on the basis of the number of
 , credit hours produced during the
’ fiscal year. Exceptions to this are

the allocations for medical pro-

 _ « grams which are made on the bas-
«° . A, is of full—time enrollment.

According to the House Bill. un-

. dergraduate programs are finan-

cial at the rate of $26 per credit

hour while graduate programs re-
T ceive $135 per credit hour. Pre-

viously. allocations were made
on the basis of a flat rate for each
registered student.

Noting the disparity between
the two rates The Pitt News at-
tempted to find out why graduate
credit hours were valued so much
higher than undergraduate.

Dr. Basil Rathbun. director of
Planning. clarified the formula.
He explained that these two fig-
ures were reached by means of a
formula that weighed the average
amount of credit hours a profes-
sor at one of the three state-re-
lated universities teaches at the
undergraduate levels.

As an example. Dr. Rathbun
quoted the figures the University
has concluded an average profes-
sor teaches. The undergraduate
professor teaches an average of

734 credit hours per year. while,
. the graduate professor teaches an

average of 270 credit hours.

The questions about this formu-
la are pertinent. Allocating money

‘at different rates might have ad-
«verse effects on courses at the

Dr.
the formula encourages the L'ni-
versity to do less in the way of
high cost graduate and undergrad-
uate programs.

A most important question to
the undergraduate student is what
effect this formula could have on
undergraduate programs.

Dr. Rathbun said that the
State’s formula tends to give the
University more incentive for
graduate programs than under-
graduate programs and could
causethe University to behave in
ways inconsistent with its long
range plans.

Dr. John Houston, professor of
Economics, expressed his views
on the question more strongly,
maintaining that “. . . the act is a
disaster for undergraduate educa-
tion. When the legislature puts a
price on credit hours in this man-
ner, it encourages it to allocate
the programs in such a way.” He
continued, saying that the situa-
tion could lead’ to larger under-

graduate classes and have a low-

er return in respect to credit
hours. ’

Dr. Houston added that "it
seems ironic that the undergrad-

inanee Formula Examined

uates are receiving the least from
the state while they were the
ones who did the most to ease the
financial situation.“

The most favorable system. in
his estimation. would be a_ return
to one in which a fixed amount

would be allocated for each reg- "

istered student.

Dr. David Kurtzman. the
state's Secretary of Education.-
agrees that the formula is "not
completely satisfactory" and is
working on extending the formula
so that it has separate figures for
upper and lower divisions. Dr.
Rathbun said that the next prob-

‘ able step after that would be sep-

arate figures for each school.

Another possible plan that
would replace the less favorable
formula" system is the “Planning.
Program. Budgeting Plan.“ This
plan. which is favored by Gover-
nor Shafer. would require each
department to submit detailed
budget reports to the state. Allo-
cations would then be made sep-
arately on the bases of these re-
ports.

(Editor's Note: This is the second
report of the Committee on Univer-
sity Resources and Services (CURS).
An ad~hoc committee founded by
President-elect Cundra and chair-
ed by Mike Haley, CURS, is present-
ly airing the complaints of students
concerning certain services.'The re-
port is a release by the committee
and does not necessarily reflect the
official position of The Pitt Nevvs.)

by DENNIS CONCILLA
SG Public Relations Director

The special events committees
of Student Government lSGl are
being coordinated this year by
Frank Bilotta. the director of Stu-
dent Activities. In an attempt to
improve the social activities at
the University. SG plans to attract
top notch entertainment for the
major weekends. The quality of
entertainment has been decreas-
ing in the past several years.

A large portion of the activities
fee that the student pays can be
utilized to attract top entertain-
ers. The social activities of the
University, however. cannot be.
confined to. a few major weekends
during the academic year. A pro-
gramhas been initiated to present
a big name group in concert in
every month of the regular school
year and twice during the summer
term.

COMMITTEES
In the past several years, the

student service committees of SG V

have been relatively inactive. This
year a comprehensive evaluation"
and expansion of student services
has been undertaken by President
Cundra. This report. which is in
its final stages. will enable the
student to enjoy discounts in
areas ranging from car rentals to
European trips and give the stu-
dent an equal opportunity to bene-
fit from programs offered at

other major universities.

The Off-Campus Housing Com-
mittee has begun to evaluate the
problems of the Oakland apart-
ment dweller. The committee.
chaired by Tom Cedel. has start-
ed this evaluation by conducting
a survey of all off-campus resi-
dents. Results of this survey are
available at the SG Office. 305 SU.
Besides evaluating many of the
off campus residences, the com-
mittee hopes to compile a listing
of all available apartments in the
Oakland area. This information
will be obtained from the local
realtors.

This listing. which promises to
be the most complete listing ever
compiled at the University. will
be published in addition to a bro-
chure on off-campus housing this
summer in time for the would-be
apartment dwellers to locate suit-
able lodging for the fall term.

Any problemswhich arise be-
tween a student and his landlord
can be referred to a grievance
man on the committee. This serv-
ice can provide an effective lobby-
ist for the student with a reluc-
tant landlord. Another service
which the committee intends to in-
novate is the creation of an infor-
mal organization of apartment
dwellers who’ will have similar in-
terests and problems.

HEALTH COMMITTEES

The Health Services Committee
has conducted several; interviews
with the director of _the Health
Center in an attempt to evaluate
the current policies of the Student_
Health Center.

They have been instrumental in

i effecting certain recent changes

in the policies of the Health Cen-
ter. The committee has planned
several special programs for the
fall term—they have scheduled a
Smokers Clinic and seminars on
pregnancy. birth control. first aid.

. and drug use and abuse.

Members of the Food Service
Committee hope to review any
open or closed bids which may be
received from competing food
services to determine which firm
would provide the best service
for all University students-
whether it be in the snack bar or
cafeteria or vending machine.

The committee is also receiving
any complaints which students
may wish to air on the University
food service. To facilitate this pro-
cedure. the committee will sched-
ule an open hearing once each
term with the food service mana-
gers andthe students.

The SG plans to inform all stu-
dents about the many unknown
services that are available‘ to
them.

COURSE EVALUATION

Although course evaluation
have been conducted in the past.
this year's course evaluation will
be conducted on a new format in
an effort to produce a totally new
concept in evaluation at the Uni-
versity. *

In the past week. students have

received the first part of the eval— ~

uation forms in the mail. All sur-
vey cards should be turned in by
April 9 so that they may be com-
piled over the summer. The
Course Evaluation Booklet will be
made available to all students.
free of charge. in the fall term.

One of the first tasks of Liberal .

Arts Cabinet will, be to undertake
a complete reviewconcerning the
purposes and goals -of a liberal
education. the current methods
used to attain these ends. and pos-
sible suggestions to improve the

quality of learning and education‘ 

at the University in the future.

In line with this objective, a re-
view ' of the lecture-recitation

- teaching‘ system would be under-

taken as well as the exploration

-The Cabinet would also like to
develop new courses that satisfy
special student needs or desires.
to this end. we would hope that
more courses dealingwith ecolo-
gy and the environment could be
instituted for liberal arts students.

Also. the Cabinet would seek to
determine student, opinion con-
cerning past curriculum changes
and any other reform that might
be proposed in the future.

The most publicized committee
of the new administration is the
Committee, on University ,Re-
sources and Services. (CURS).
CURS has been misperceived by
many students.— The function of
the committee is to be a general
t'acilitat_or.- _V g .

That is. CURS hears the com-
plaints of all students and then
conducts ‘the necessary investiga-
tion to-substantiate these com-
plaints. If the complaints'turn:out
to be -valid. CURS recommends to

. the appropriate officials certain

methods of solving the problem
and thus eliminate. the complaint.

It has notebeen CURS itself that
has caused concern among certain
areas of the University. but their
procedure of. telling the rest of
the University community what
itis doing. _ I‘

  Film Future Predicted

by POHLA SMITH
Staff Writer

Jonas Mikas. a renowned in-
dependent film maker. was’in
Pittsburgh for the showing of his
latest film Diaries, Notes, and
Sketches at Carnegie Hall. gave a
press conference Wednesday af-
ternoon.

Mikas. known as "the patron
saint of the New American Cine-
ma,” explained the content of his
film Diaries. As in the literary
form of diaries. a flim diary
shows the realities of the author’s
own work. Mikas explained that
one difference between film di-
aries and literary diaries is that
a literary diary is a reflection of
the author, while the author of a
film diary must react to the event
while it happens. I

Mikas also explained the differ-

A meeting of Students for
Shapp, the student organiza-
tion working on behalf of Milton
Shapp, gubernatorial candidate
from Philadelphia, has been
scheduled for Monday at 12:30
p.m. in Dining Room A of the
Student Union.

Students interested in finding
out more about Mr. Shapp’s
ideas, as well as becoming in-
volved in the campaign, are in-
vited. In addition to students
who will be spending the sum-
mer in Pittsburgh, a campaign
spokesman indicated interest in ,,

derground” movies and Holly-
wood cinema. Hollywood movies
are narrative. that is they tell a
story; the underground movies
are not narrative; they express a
feeling. He compared the differ-
ence to the difference between
novels and stories and poetry.

When asked if he foresaw a
change in commerical films Mik-
as replied that the next five or ten
years would bring great change.

One change would be that inde-
pendent, inexpensive films would
be considered equal to Hollywood
productions.

Mikas also feels that the public

will start making home film li-
braries with the advent of the new
casette type films that will be as
inexpensive to purchase as a nov-

Welfare Eligibility

Explained

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

A. group‘ of students receiving
welfare assistance has banded to-
gether at the University to im-
prove thier own financial situa-
tion and to inform others_of the
eligibility requirements.

Led and initially organized by
English major John Fisher, the
students hope to set up a welfare
rights organization that may
eventually net them free book and
transportation money while they
are full-time students;

According to Fisher, the prece-

dent for such requests was set by
Allegheny Community College last
fall. ~ C

“There are no really strict
guidelines for eligibility,” ventur-
ed Fisher. “The main require-
ment is the admission of your par-
ents that they cannot afford to pay

-for you to go to school.”

He believed that many students
now struggling for funds may be
unaware of the welfare avenue.

If application for welfare is ac-
cepted. the recipient _is awarded
$136 monthly. with the stipulation
that any founds acquired above
the amount of $50 will be deduct-
ed.

In -addition, the recipient is li-
able for free medical assistance.

The welfare rights group has
two long range goals according to
its founder: to cut the red tape
involved in obtaining welfare sub-
sidies. and to eventaally work to-
wards a change in the overall as-
sesment of eligibility.

Students interested in applying
for welfare aid can do so down-
town at 610 Wood St., or get in
touch with Fisher at his address,
709 S. Aiken.

°They Shoot Horses’

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Entertainment Editor

They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?
an obvious allegory of the process
of human degrdation is currently
showing at the Forum Theatre in
Squirrel Hill.

Set in the depression days of the
1930‘s. the film begins with a
small boy's witnessing of the
shooting of a horse with a broken
legs. Then the scene abruptly
switches to a run-down dance hall-
room just before a marathon
dance contest is scheduled. The
potentially believable context of

the story‘s action is somewhat

marredby a series of "flashfor-
wards" which seem to be almost
totally unrelated to the marathon
dancers. ;
Director sydney Pollack care-
fully leads the characters through
a series of ordeals on the dance
floor designed to show how low hu-
mans can go when necessity stares
them in the face. Jan Fonda as
Gloria gives a convincing por-
trayal of an extremely embitter-
ed young girl from Texas who
tried and failed to make it as an
actess in California. She comes
across sorstrong that you find
yourself believing that she'll ac-
tually win the marathon because
she stops at nothing.

» Portrays Degradation

Michael Sarrazin as Robert, on
the other hand, never quite lives
in reality. By chance, he finds
himself in the marathon as Jane
Fonda’s dance partner. As an in-
curably romantic dreamer, his
character is periodically confus-
ed by the “fIasht'orwards” reveal-
ing him as a criminal but not tell-
ing his crime. Not until the end of
the film do we discover what he
has done. ' ‘

They Shoot Horses is a pathetic
display of human misery and de-
sire. As the glittering emcee and

ringleader of the marathon circus
world. fGig young urges apathetic

spectators to cheer thier favor-

cluding. ‘_‘After all.-isn7t that the
American way?” ‘His only con-
cern is the effect of the show on
the audience. "We have to give
the audience something to believe
in." he repeatedly says to the
dancers. He is convinced that the
only way to draw crowds is to
show them people more miserable
than they are.

Flashes of humor and compas-
sion appear sporadically during
the film..but for the most part
They Shoot Horses remains a de-
pressing chronicle of disillusion-
ment. Theend. when it comes. is
almost melodramatic but fortu-
nately is carried off by Fonda

pathetic and depressing. and it is
a reminder of what happened be-
fore and can happen again. It
strikes a blow at the American
dream. It will make _vou think.

‘°C-rass’ For

The Stadium 

  by SIIEP GOLDBERG
Student Representative
on the Senate Athletic Committee

There’s a good chance that there will be as many in-

be for the entire regular season. Already four or five players
have suffered leg injuriesas a result of a football field

est snow and rain, the sod is torn up and the footing trea-
cherous. Each morning Carl DePasqua prays for a clear day.
Already he has missed four days of practice. _

This and many other problems could all be avoided
with the addition of Astro-Turf to the stadium. Not only
could practice be" held during any type of weather on a field
which would ‘stay in rperfect condition, but it-' seems that ’
the turf would be a panacea for the majority of the Athle-

, tic Department’s woes.

This University is rapidly growing in population, but
the Athletic Department has no 1and'on which to expand.
Astro-Turf is the answer. With it, the stadium would be '
available to the football team, soccer team, band, and in-
tramural competition. The entire»University. community
would have access to it. Trees Field (presently used by the
soccer team) could be made into a parking lot, something
that is desperately needed but never built because of lack
of space. ' ‘

Yearly expenses is another problem which could be sol-
ved with the installation of Astro-Turf. Each year the.foot-
ball field is resodded at the cost of $25,000. In addition,
$15-$20,000 is needed a year for maintenance of the field.
The sod is put on in the early spring and in order to allow
it to settle, it must be kept off of until the first game. ’

All of this is unnecessary with Astro-Turf. It costs
somewhere between $300-$450,000 to install. Once in, it
never needs maintenance. It is guaranteed for ten years
and it never wears-out. In fact, a test at the University of_
Pennsylvania revealed that shoes wear out ‘before the
turf! Therefore, ten years of resodding would be the same
as buying the, Astro-Turf, which never needs to be replac-
ed.

Athletic Director Casimir. Myslinski is convinced that

Astro-Turf is the answer to Pitt’s problems. He feels, how-- =

ever, that it is important to get it this year.

“The time to get it is now,” he notes. “Athletics are
on the upswing. You don’t,._want to wait until we’ve- reach-
ed our peak, but now, while we're building. ' I _

“Also,” he adds, “the -machinery to :0 installirithe turf is
already down at Three Rivers Stadium. We could bargain
with these people. Another reason to':insta11 it now is be-
cause we could do it this summer since the track team has
no home meets.“ ' ' 4’ ; - .

Everyone fr_om Myslinski to Abbey (a member of the
Pittground crew) is convinced that Astro-Turf is the
answer. Myslinski has been workingon this project for
over a year.‘What, then, is holding it up? ’

“I honestly don’t know,” remarks Myslinski. ‘‘I’m
ready to sit down and talk with these companies, but I
can't until [get the go-ahead.” - ‘ ' 0 '

‘Cindrich’

 

For their performance in the
tournament both wrestlers have
been recognized as All Ameri-
cans. v

Payne won four come-from-
behind matches before losing
an 8-0 decision to Dwane Kell-
er of Oklahoma State in the fin-
al match, giving him the second
place finish.

Kuhn lost two bouts on the
final day of the meet. the first
by 14-7 to Kim Snyder of Ore-
gon State and the second to

. Charles Shepard of Utah. This

gave Kuhn his sixth place stand-
ing.

Kuhn felt that he had a ad-
vantage because his wrestling
style was unknown to the other
grapplers. ‘

“I wrestled my own ' way,”
stated Kuhn, “Take downs are
my weakness. They didn’t know
this and I stayed standing.”

Payne, Kuhn Become All—Ame1'icans
     Randy Captures Second --Place,  
Bob Grabs NCAA Crap Sixth  

Kuhn described Payne‘s per-
formance as. "Amazing. truly
amazing. He never stopped. I
wish all of the guys had his
kind of go."

Coach Dave Adams could only
describe his team’s performance
as "great”.

“Payne did an outstanding
job,” reported Adams,” and Kuhn
came through with his usual
steady performance.

“Kuhn had a great year and

he wrestled as he was capable of
doing. He may have been able
to do better."

The coach felt that the six-

minute matches handicaped
Kuhn since he was notable to
rely on superior conditioning

to wear his opponent down.

Adams gave all of his wrest-
lers credit for the teams per-
formance, citing Jim Caramana

drich, however, feels that the

‘He mentioned that he might

think about it.

linemen, a quarterback, and two
running backs.$a-I

ers are not only looking. beyond

Wessel Takes A “Dive,”
Finishes 48th, 50th

In Diving

Nationals  

by JERRY MYERS

Dave Wessel will now have the opportunity to join the rest of his
teammates as they enjoy a well-deserved summer break after almost
nine months of intensive swimming workouts and competition.

Wessel, Pitt's oustanding varsity diver, returned Monday from
Salt Lake City, Utah, the site of the 1970 NCAA swimming and div-
ing championships. Wessel. competing against a field of 68 divers had a
disappointing weekend, finishing 48th in the one’-meter dive and 50th

a real hard time breaking in.”

The over-all winner of the meet
was Indiana who captured its
third consecutive NCAA swim-
ming and diving championship.

Finishing a full 97 points below
Indiana was Southern California,
followed by Stanford, UCLA,Lng
Beach State, Michigan, Southern‘
Methodist, Colorado State, Tenne-
see, and Ohio State rounding the
top ten. ,

The Indiana Hoosiers were pac-
ed by Mark Spitz. Lawrence Bar-
biere, Gary Hall and James Hen-
ry. but according Gant. Mike
Burton of UCLA ‘stole the show.
Burton captured the 1650—yard
freestyle.‘ the 500-yard freestyle
and the 200-yard butterfly events.

Spitz took the 100-yard butter-
fly event but was upset in the 200-
yard freestyle by Juan Bello of

’Michigan. Spitz still holds the rec-

ord. though. with his time of
l:39.5 which he set one year ago.

Jim Henry won both the one-
and three-meter diving events.
Henry has collected five NCAA
diving championships, winning
the three-meter event twice and
the one-meter event three times.
Stanford's Brian Job won his
second championship and estab-
lished an NCAA record in the 200-
yard breaststroke with a time of

‘ 2:05.99. Earlier in the three-day

meet Job had captured the 100-
_vard breaststroke event.

Larry Barbiere. another Hoosi-
er. won the 100-yard backstroke
event with a record breaking time

‘of 51.91 which was followed by an-

other Indiana‘ star. Gary Hall's
victory in the 400-yard individual
(4:07.3). Halls time
broke the NCAA record for that
event set one year ago by Hans

   

-in the three-meter event. According to Coach B11 Grant. “Dave just had

Mike Brown finished eighth in the
one-meter and sixth in the three
meter.“ Dartmouth made the
best showing of any of the Eastern
teams. finishing 11th in the com-
petition.

Mitch Ivey, from Long Beach
State set another NCAA'record
with his time of 1:52.77 in the
200-yard backstroke.

Although the western schools
exhibited some outstanding, in-
dividual swimming they j u st
compete with Indiana's depth.
Burton a gold-medal winner from
the 1968 Olympics in Mexico stole
the show with‘ his three big vic-
tories but the swimming of Spitz.
Hall and Barbiere. coupled with
the outstanding diving of Jim Hen-
rywas too much to contend.

It is significant to point out that
Yale did not particate in the meet
in accordance with the ruling by
the NCAA earlier this year. Yale's
presence might have made the
Eastern schools’ ‘tally more re-
spectable.

In an effort to improve the Pitt
swim team‘. and now that the post-
season championships are over.
Grant is intensifying his own re-
cruiting program. "were looking
for freestylers. The recruiting is
coming along fine. we’re -looking

whether he was looking forward

last month. They compiled a 2-3'
record on the tour.

Lewis plans to use George Med-
ich and Mike Niccols as starting
pitchers. “By having Medich and
Niccols pitch. Bob Solinickne will
be available for the outfield," he
said. "-We can use Bob’s big bat in
the lineup. When Bob pitches. he
usually ‘does not hit as well as.
when he plays outfield. probably.

due to his great concentration on
pitching."

Lewis expects the Mounties to
present strong pitching. "I don’t
know exactly what they have done
but I do know that they have two
fine pitchers." he related.

Four senior lettel'mu.I.'l silidiry
the infield. Frank Gustine, last
year’s leading hitter, will start at
first base. Cliff Brown (captain ‘
of the squad) will start at second,
while Ron O’Grodnick will be at
short. Ron Howie rounds out‘ the
infield at"third. —

’Guy Caparelli will be the only
starting freshman’; he will open
ats the catcher. This is the first
season that baseball teams are
permitted to use freshmen in var-
sity competition. .

Two sophomores will break into
the starting outfield. Terry Stokes
will play centerfield. while Ken
Macha will be stationed in right- _
field. Solonickneis the final start-
er.; he will play left field.

Because all three ‘outfielders
are righthanders, Lewis may sub-
stitute lefty John Fredland for
hitting purposes if West Virginia’
throws right handed pitchers in
the games.

Bob ‘Kohl. a starting outfielder

last season. will also be available '_; '

If the games aren't cancelled
due to bad weather. 'it‘ll be the‘

"Hitting is the only part of our

practice very well." Lewis“ re-

Thinclads At Kentucky

For Spring Opener

by VINCE DiNARDO

If you think that old man winter has been rough on you this .

‘Spring. just think how bad it‘s been for coach Jim Banner and his
Track team. The Thin-clads open their outdoor season today at Ken-
tucky without the benefit of a outside practice.

"We will do a lot of experi-
menting in the relays". said
Banner whose men will partici-
pate in individual events as there
is no team score in the relays.

"Ohio State and a lot of Big
Ten schools will be there," he
said, "and because this is a
Southern meet a lot of schools
will come down just to do some
outside work”.

All-American Jerry Richey will
run in the three mile event and
Bryant Salter will high jump
for Pitt. “We won’t enter any of
the short sprinting events for fear
of injuries,” Banner said.

Pulled. muscles are common
this early and the Thinclads have
had enough injuries already.

Dave Chesebrough will not
make the trip to Kentucky be-
cause of a bad foot. "I’d rather
miss him for this one, than lose

Sports Editor
Pitt sophomore pitcher Mike
Niccols is possibly the only

I ' college baseball hurler in the na-

\

tion listed on his team’s roster as
a left-and right-handed pitcher.

You saw that correctly—pitcher.

Not a left-and-right handed bat-
ter. I guess you couldcall him
a "switch pitcher,-“ right?

Actually, Niccols has never
thrown from the left side in a
college game. but he has attempt-
ed the maneuver in practice ses-
sions, and there’s a. strong chance
that he will do it this spring for
Bobby Lewis’ mitters.

“I can’t wait until a team has
a right-handed hitter first and

_ then a left hander,” Lewis said.

“I can see the other coach now!
We’ll send another glove out to
Mike and let him throw lefty.”

Niccols remembers‘ the one
time when his ambidexterity up-
set an opposing team’s coach.

"In Philadelphia (his home)
I warmed-up left-handed once
before agame in the '_ American
Legion and the other team start-
ed all righies. I pitched the
game right-handed and blew the

coach's mind.”

Niccols hasn’t thrown left-
handed since last spring, though.
Because of the bad weather he
hasn’t been able to get much
work for his number one arm -
the right one.

Lewis thought that Niccols
started the "two-handed" pitch-
ing because of a broken arm dur-
ing high school days. but Nic-

HOMECOMING SLATED’

The October 17th game with
West Virginia has been desig-
nated as Pitt‘s 1970 football
homecoming game. The battle
with -the arch-rival Mountain-
eers is one of five home games
on Pitt's schedule. The others
are with UCLA. Miami (Fla.).
Kent State. and Boston College.

ner.

Ken Silay is out for the season
as he broke‘ his ankle in the
Knights of Columbus meet two
weeks ago. It’s too bad it had
to happen”, said Banner of Sil-
ay.” He was a good runner. We
will miss him.”

The Bannermen will have less
depth as they move outdoors, as
there are more events. Last year
they won all dual meets and
placed 4th" in the IC4A compe-
tition.

“I am always

that if no more serious injuries
come their way, the team would
perform well.

was dislocated was his left one——
that’s the number two limb.

_"I really started in wiffle ball

Banner and his Assistant Bob _

Shaw also seem to be “accept-

runners for next year. “We’re

"and the ones we get will be
good ones.”

“I didn’t even have a. curve

g The scouts can’t teach anyone
how to throw with a second hand,‘
though. Not unless they’re wif-

‘Crass’ For
’ The Stadium

(Continued from Page 19)

Dave Hart waited three years to get new practice
fields, and he wasn’t around to use them. Is this going to
be another one of those deals?

So until someone, somewhere, gives Myslinski the okay,
Carl DePasqua will have to pray for good weather before
each game, people will have to walk up the hill because of
no parking facilities, and you’ll see some good football
players on crutches. Cas Myslinski is waiting by the
phone. Hopefully it will not take three years to ring.

I Weather Delay  
Openers Until Early Next Week

Inclement weather has delayed
the opening of the golf and tennis
seasons.

The golf team has canceled their
first two matches. The first match
was scheduled for Tuesday,
March 31, with West Virgina, and
the second was slated for April 2,
against Carnegie-Mellon.

Coach Rex Peery hopes to re-
schuedule the C-MU match, but

since the team plays West Vir-V

ginia again on May 2, that match
will not be rescheduled.

The tennis team has canceled
its March 31 match, also against
West Virginia. Their next match
will be Tuesday, April 7, against
Indiana.

Coach Fran Webster stated,

"The matches were canceled due
to inclement condition. We were
not sure that the courts would be
in proper condition.
