Testing   Final Com

Scheduled

by SHE RYLL ZIPPAY

Second term sophomores of the
College of Arts and Sciences and
the School of Engineering will be
required to take standardized ex-
aminations in order to secure
normative data on the University
student population. The data will
be used to determine the range
of performance of second term
sophomores to establish a criter-
ion against which applicants for
admission with advanced stand-
ing to the College can be com-
pared.

For students from the College,
the examination will be given in
the Meeting Room, lower level,
of the Syria Mosque beginning at
9 am. until noon, with an after-
noon session from 1:15 p.m. un-
til 4:30 p.m. Engineering students
will report to the Luncheon Room
in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.

James A. Kehl, dean of the
College, stated that “Most of the
community colleges of the Com-
monwealth anticipated that the
majority of their students would
register in two-year terminal pro-
grams but found that their cli-
entele preferred the two-year

I transfer program. These students

will be applying for transfer to
four-year institutions such as the
University in the near future.”

He also pointed out that since
the University became state-r,e-
lated, “the number of applicants
for admission with Adva.nced
Standing from other four-year in-
stitutions and two-year colleges
has increased threefold.”

The Geneial Examination bat-
tery of the College Level Exam-
ination Program will be used to
evaluate level -of achievement
and general education. The tests

New ‘Weekend’ Tries To Balance
In—State, Out—of-State Student Ratio

Prospective freshman students will again have an
opportunity to orient themselves to the University when
they come to “Weekend At Pitt.” The activities of this
new program begin Saturday morning.

The expressed purpose of “Weekend At Pitt” is to

make an attempt to level out
the imbalance of the in-state,
out-of-state student ratio. The
program is sponsored by Stu,-
dent Government (SG) and co-
ordinated by the SG Secondary
Schools Committee.

There is a marked similarity
between “Weekend at Pitt” and
“Pitt Preview,” but the commit-
tee has made a number of im-
portant improvements, accord-
ing to Weekend Chairman Alan
Bauer.

The Weekend Committee had
planned on entertaining about
500 prospective freshman.

Bauer stated that SG Second-

  

have selected about 100 guides
for the new freshman. This
means that the guide to student

ratio will be one to ﬁve. “With v_

this ratio,” said Bauer, “we
hope to provide a close rela-
tionship between the guide and
the student.”

The program will cover two
days of activities. Everything
will start Saturday morning
with registration and an ad-
dress to the students by Chan-
cellor Wesley W. Posvar.

The address will be followed
by a guided tour of the campus.

Editorial: A Constructive Innovation .

All second-term sophomores in both The College and the School
of Engineering will be requiredto take a standardized test prepared by
the Educational Testing Service two weeks from today. When we first
learned of this innovation, our uppermost concern was that the test
would be used to determine whether second-term sophomores advanced
to junior rank. This is a practice adhered to by many schools and one
that we cannot condone. We were assured that this will not be the case;
the purpose of testing the second-term sophomores is to establish a norm

for the performance level of our students.

With the advent of the two-year community college, it is of vital
importance that we establish this norm. For statistics reveal that most
students who enroll in the community colleges choose to take a college
preparatory program, with hopes of transferring to a four-year college
after completing the two-year program. The University is a logical
choice for those students from community and two-year colleges in this
area. However, unless there is a means of measuring the performance
of students who have attended the University for two years as opposed
to those who want to transfer from the community and two-year col-
leges, the admissions office has to make an educated guess on what stu-

dents will best be able to do well at our University.

Our new state-related status has given the University an added

A Last Column

" attracton to Pennsylvania students enrolled in four-year colleges both
in our state and elsewhere, and many of these students want to transfer
here. This re-emphasizes the need for establishing a level of performance,
because we only can take a limited number of transfer students and
should judge those we do admit by the fairest means.

We want to take this opportunity to commend the farsightedness
of The College and its Dean, James Kehl. Dean Kehl has once more
exerted positive leadership in the innovation of the tests for second-

term sophomores, but this is only one more accomplishment in a long

The Death Of Reason

Unless something big hap-
pens, this is my last column
for the paper. It caps three
years here, and much has
happened to me in those
years. But while I am a
journalist, I was also a stu-
dent, and in the end, I think
the student will live longer
shant theniioama l.l.S.l3+1I.- :i.u.s_t
spent more time at the one

_ than the other.

So this column will not be
about the school or the pa-
per or the financial crisis
or anything else. It will be
about me, and my educa-
tion. It is the last time that
I will “publish” until, God
willing, I get my doctorate
and start to write as a Psy-
chologist. This column will
be about what I learned, and
what I’d like somebody else
to think about. It is the pro-
duct of my Baccalaureate
education, my personal sum-
ming up.

What I have been con-
stantly impressed with these
last four years is the pre-

tention that most of us, and
especially our leaders live
their lives with. We always
manage to have a high and
holy reason for doing every-
thing. The President is de-
fending “Freedom” in Viet-
nam, the Universities are
fighting for “Academic
_E_reedom-,” and_ all of us are
running around calling our-
selves Liberals, Conserva-
tives, Intellectuals, Avant
Garde. The attraction of
image and aura, the appeal
of having a “thing” makes
people into junior idealogues
who go about professing
their half-understood faiths
with all the zeal of the a-

postles, an_d all the toler-

ance of inquisitors. Philoso-
phies soon become dogmas
as fools rush past reason in
their search for elysium.
Prophets become dema-
gogues and demagogues co-
lossi. '

Curiously enough, one of
the few people who seem to
have shown any kind of rea-

A reestablish their faith in

by Hobart Harris

son at all is not a great phil-
osopher or stateman, or
teacher. His name is Ringo
Starr, a singer. A few weeks
ago, Ringo went with the
Beatles to study with the
Maharishi Yogi in the Him-
alayan mountains to medi-
tate and search for truth,
so it was announced.

They arrived bedecke-d
with flowers and were
whisked to the Maharishi’s
headquarters where they
settled down for long ses-
sions with the guru, sur-
rounded by a smokescreen
of all the gibberish and the
hoopla that a mystic move-
ment is always able to put
out. Did Ringo stay? Not
really. He put up for it for
a week or so, and then left,
announcing that he didn’t
like the food.

And, for all the other Bea-
tle’s protestations of truth
and reason and philisophy’,
Ringo is the only one that I
ca.n respect. For he recog-
nized that the important
things in life are filling
your belly, raising your kids
and keeping your wife. Eve-
rything else is trivial. For
all their pretentions, the
only Beatle who can quali-
fy for the title of philoso-
pher is Ringo, and he did
It with 3 Yearning for ﬁsh
and chips. It would be nice
to see a few other people
think that way too.

But men are too busy hat-
ing each other because of
what they think to consider
the value of their own stom-
achs. And at the bottom of
it is that they are so hung
upon their own values and
perceptions of the world, so
sure that they are right,
that they are busily double.
crossing each other, refus-
mg to understand each oth-
er, killing each other. And
each and every one of them
1S doing it for nothing but
the highest moral princi-
ples.

I have often heard it said
that even with all the hat-
red and fear and evil in
thls World. men can still
Pray, and take time out to

  

  

list of achievements. A man who is strong in his support of students,
Dean Kehl has stood by the student Liberal Arts Cabinet and consulted
them on issues of student concern, such as the scheduled tests. Last
year, with his backing, pass-fail courses for juniors and seniors were
instituted for the first time. The approval of pass-fail. courses was a
major breakthrough for a student group and one that has. proven. bene-

ficial to the student.

It is heartening the students receive such solid support from the
Dean of the College. He has proven over the years that he is one who
is willing to recognize student needs. We only wish a man of his con-
cern were not such a rarity at this University.

Student Lauds Litchﬁeld Aides

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was quite disgruntled with
a comment made by Howard
Ainisman in the Feb. 26 issue
of The Pitt News in the article.
stating that John C. Larigstaff is
allegedly leaving the Universi-
ty. Mr. Ainisman asserted that:
“It is about time that most of
the Litchﬁeld appointees should
leave.” This statement, it read
by someone who is unfamiliar
with Chancellor Litchﬁeld and
who might only know him and
his administration as being in-
volved in some ﬁnancial crisis,
would lead the reader to a con-
clusion contrary to the truth.
The signiﬁcance of Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld’s administration to every
aspect of the University and to
the entire community certainly
cannot be summarized in a few
sentences. But I shall touch on
what I, as .a student of this Uni-
versity, see as the signiﬁcance
of the Litchﬁeld administration.

As most of us know, when
Dr. Litchﬁeld was brought here,
the University consisted of the
Cathedral, Clapp Hall, Dithridge
House Dormitory, and a few
other classroom buildings. Dr.
Litchﬁeld ap-pointed competent
administrators in all ﬁelds

_ (among them Edison Montgom-

ery) and began what is said to
be the most massive single-ca.m-
pus expansion program ever
embarked upon by a school in
such a short time. Schenley Ho-
tel was purchased for ‘the
school’s ﬁrst student union and
the Schenley Apartment build-
ings were converted into the
quad dorms. Other buildings
‘planned and built u-nder the
Litchﬁeld administration include
the Tower Dorms, Scaife Hall,
Trees Hall, Frick Fine Arts
Building, Langley Hall, Nurses’
Residence, Cyclatron Labora-
tory, Sarah Mellon Scaife Radi-
ation Lab, Van de Graff Accel-
lerattor Lab Building, the com-
plete renovation of S-allk Hall
and the moving of the Book
Center from the bottom of the
Cathedral to its present loca-
tion. The new engineering build-

their principles.“ I would
phrase it a little different-
ly, saying that with all the
praying and statements of
belief in faith and reason,
men still find the time to
kill. It is not in spite of the
fact that we are evil that we
still find the time to pray,
it is because of it. The two

things are the result of one

ing, Hillman Library, Common '

Facilities Building, and the Stan-
the Stanton Crawford Science
are among others planned by
Litchﬁeld and his administra-
ti-on.

The Litchﬁeld Administrationls
contribution to the physical
plant of the University certain-
1y was only a part of the great-
ness it brought to Pitt. One of
its biggest achievements was
increasing the school's endow-
ment from $30 million to over
$120 million in just a few short
years.

Academically, Litchﬁeld re-
cruited t-op educators in an ef-
fort to create greatness. Among
these men are Dr. A. C. Van
Deusen and Dr. Charles Peake.
These men and other Litchﬁeld
appointees made great contribu-
tions in their respective areas.
Additional departments were
created, among them the An-
thoropology Department, De-
partment of Earth and Plane-
tary Science, the Graduate
School of Business, School of
Libra-ry Science, GSPIA and the
School of General Studies. He
also strengthened or complete-
ly revamped the School of Ed-
ucation, the Graduate School of
Public Health, and the Phil-oso-*
phy Department perhaps num-
ber one in the country. The ad-
ministration also ? ? ? to the
phasing out of the Undergrad-
uate School of Business Admin-
istration, which most good uni-
versities look upon as improper.

When the Litchﬁeld adminis-
tration took over, there were 30
per cent P'h.D.’s,. upon leaving
this ﬁsgure was almost tripled.
Men in almost every department
are renowned nationally. And
there were ﬂrsts, such as the
trimester. ,

The Litchﬁeld administration
fared very well ﬁnancially until
near its end. Upon the death of
Pitt's greatest benefactor, a ﬁ-
nancial crisis began and Dr.
Litchﬁe-ld was dismissed, many
say unfairly. Now here we are
in retrospect three years later,
still building Litchﬁeld projects,
appreciating academic excellence
brought here by a. great chancel-
lor and his staff. It is easy for
some to forget what was cre-
ated—for it is here. But I ask
Mr. Ainisman if it is not about
time for the Litchﬁeld appoin-
tees to be lauded; for they, with
the Chancellor, are responsible
for almost all of what know as
Pitt. »

BRUCE UNANGST
Undefeated Sophomore

 

1 RON SCHUCHERT
Closes Wrestlting Career

Improved Matmen

Will Score Higher

Last year, varsity wrest-
ling fell to the bottom after
a long history of excellence.
In the-Eastern tournament, the
grapplers scored minus two
points and ﬁnished 15th.

This year, new head coach
Dave Adams has brought the
squad back. to respectability
with a 5-6 record, and he prom-
ises the team will continue its
improvement this weekend in
the Easterns.

“We’re going to shoot for a
first division ﬁnish,” commented
Ad-ams. “Last year we only won
three. We’ve got to win more
this season.”

As could be expected, Adams
listed Bruce Unangst (123), Dick
Shildt (130), Ron Schuchert
(137), and Terry Hoover (heavy-
weight) as the wrestlers with
the best chance for the varsity.
If three of the four place, the
points could be enough for a
ﬁrst division ﬁnish.

Adams hastened togadd that
several of his other Vvrestlers
were liable to pull so-me sur-
prises.

“Larry Cuba possibly could.

pull some upsets,” he said.
“(Jim) Rhone is most likely to
surprise someone. Tim Trax and
(Jack) Kuhn could pull some
big matches for us. And Paul
Allen can't be counted out.”

But the wrestlers’ main hopes
lie with the other four Adams
named. And up until Monday.
there was some doubt abﬂllt
Unangst’s and Schuchert’s con-
dition. Both were recovering
from injuries.

“Unangst will be ready to go.”
assured Adams. “We’re hoping
he'll be at full strength. That
default Saturday (Syracuse for-
feited the 123 pound match)
certainly didn't hurt him any
and it gave him a chance to
rest.

“Schuchert will be okay, too.”
Adams added.

While most of the lineup is
set, Adams admitted that he
might not determine Hoover-’s
status for sure until the ﬁnal
weigh-ins. It is most likely H00“
or will go at heavyweight, with

Last year, only Shildt, Cuba,

even ﬁrst round decisions. Their
three points were offset by the

ized for not ﬁelding a heavy-
weight.

This year, the grapplers will
ﬁeld a full team. It only re-
mains to be seen how far Adams
has brought his team this year.

Navy Favored to Crack
Lehigh’s Title Defense

by ROY JACOBS

For the second time in three years, the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Wrestling Championships will take place at the
Fitzgerald Field House starting with preliminary rounds
Friday afternoon and closing with the Saturday night championships.
Lehigh has won the team title each of the last two seasons, but
this time around Navy is favored for its first team crown since 1946.
The Middies just completed their first undefeated season (9-0) in 20

years.

“Navy will take it,” predict-
ed Pitt coach Dave Adams.
“They have overall balance, and
they have some outstanding in-
dividuals.” Navy coach Ed Peery
wasn’t quite as certain as his
former employee.

“Navy, Penn State, Lehigh,
and Army are the clubs that ﬁg-
ure to battle for the champion-
ship,” guessed Peery. “We were
other teams during the dual
fortunate enough to defeat the
meet season, but the tournament
is an entirely new proposition.
We’re all starting fresh. It
should be an interesting week-
end.”

Nevertheless, NaVy’s qualiﬁ-
cations as favorite are mighty
impressive. For starters, Peery’s
roster lists three grapplers who
were All-America last year:

,Gary Burger (123), Pete Van-

derlofske (145), and John Kent
(160). Vanderlofske is a return-
ing Eastern champ, while Burg-
er ﬁnished third in the NCAA’s
with Kent ﬁfth.

len (5-1-1 at 191), and Bo-b

,Ahren:s (6-2 at 167), and Navy

has a formidable lineup.
However, Penn State, Lehigh,
and Army will all have a lot to
say in determining the eventual
team champion. Penn State (6-2)

only lost to Navy by a 17-14:

margin in their dual meet.

The Lions list four genuine
threats for individual titles, yet
their only returning champ,
heavyweight Mike Reid, can't
wrestle because of a knee op-
eration.

State's hopefuls are Wally
Clark (third at 123 in 1967) at
130, Vince Fitz (runner-up at 137
last year) at 145, Matt Kline ‘at
160 or 167, and captain Rich
Lorenzo (runner-up at 177 in
1967) at 191.

Penn State has capable wrest-
lers at most of the other

four seeds in his first attempt at the 130-pound
crown after two tries at 123.

 

weights, and they should pick 
up enough points to keep the 
Lions close. _ 

Lehigh, on the other hand, has 
a long way to come after su’ffer- A 
ing its worst season (6-5) since.t”j
1951-52. Yet, two weeks ago, the‘ 
Engineers upset Penn State, 22-

“Lehigh readjusted themselves _ V: 
and have gotten themselves set-

tled down,” reported Adams. 6
“And they do have a tendency
to make a good s.ho-wing in the
Easterns.” 3‘ ~ -

These good showings include 9
19 team titles and 93 individual
titles, including the last two. .
But last year the Engineers, 
were largely aided by Mike Cw-
ruso and Joe Peritore, who each
won an Eastern title, but have
since graduated. -

Lehigh placed in nine of the 
ten weight classes last year, but
few of the returnees are of
championship calibre. Good bets
to place, though, are Pete Hen-
ning (130), Elliott Tepper (145),
and Ro-n Ries (191).

The last time the Easterns
were at Pitt, Army finished
third. Coach Leroy Alitz is hop-
ing to ﬁnish as high this time,
The Cadets’ top horses are their
upper weights, being fairly sol- .-
id between 160 and heavyweight. a

.Mike Nardotti (160), and Jim

Harter (177) both carry unde-
feated records.

“Penn is not a bad team,” re-
marked Adams, switching the
talk to the Ivy League schools.
“Penn’s going to be tougher
than anyone ﬁgured them to
be.”

The Quakers won their ﬁrst
Ivy League championship this
season and ﬁnished undefeated.
Three individuals also were un-
beaten, while two others only
lost once. » V 

Most of the other schools are p 
hoping for stand -out individ-
ual performances. ~

 

  
  
     
  
 

 

 
 
 

PETE VANDERLOFSKE
Defends at 145

 i..i~n-.2 rrrr News... Wednesday. March a, 1968

Only Two Wrestlers Return To Defend Crwns

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

Pete Vanderlofske could, but maybe
he Won’t, while Jim Harter definitely will.

Both return to the Eastern Tournament this
year, as the only defending champions. And start-
ing Friday, both will . . . er, should be defending
their crowns. The only catch is that Vanderlofske
of Navy, the 145 pound champion from last season,
may be entered at 137.

The reasoning behind the switch could be
attributed to Vanderlofske’s lone loss in eight out-
ings. Cornell's Ben Bishop, who might be a favor-
ite in the tournament, has already defeated Van-
derlofske.

Bishop pinned the midshipman in 4:02 in a
145 bout.

It was the first time Vanderlofske has ever
been pinned. But the loss renewed the senior’s
confidence. He made a vow to his coach, Ed Peery.

“Coach,” said Vanderlofske, “I’m going to win
the National Championship.” However, Vince Fitz,
of Penn State, may have something to say con-
cerning the Easterns when the quarterfinals start
Friday.

_ Harter, the defending title holder at 177, will
remain at that weight for the Eastems.

Harter is undefeated in nine matches. He has

two draws, and probably will face at least one of
the wrestlers he drew against.

Harter drew with Lehigh’s Jack Bentz at 2-2.
Syracuse's Bob Rust held Harter to a one-all draw.
Against four other Eastern opponents, Harter is 4-0.

Harter decisively won over the Panthers’ Paul
Allen, 15-5. He pinned Co1umbia’s Charles Vagell
at 7:48.

Harter’s success parallels Army's recent wrest-
ling improvement. Two years ago, When the East‘
erns were held in Pittsburgh, Army tied Penn
State for third place. It was the best the cadets
had done in two decades up until then-

Harter is one big reason why Army is a dark-
horse for the Easterns.

Vanderlofske, in contrast, heads the favorite
unbeaten Navy team. “Pete is what you Call 8
blackboard wrestler,” remarked his coach, Ed
Peery. “Pete follows the directions to the letter.
He has tremendous concentration in a bout.”

Vanderlofske has outpointed his opposition, 47-
4 in six decisions. His career’s dual meet mark
stands at 20-4-1. As a sophomore he finished third
in- the Easterns. ‘

But on Thursday, when the seeding is made,
Vanderlofske must decide where to wrestle, and
sitting back and watching will be Harter and the
upset-minded cadets.

(82-1) make the class a near
toss-up. Shildt lost to Clark 6-5
on riding time and he drew with
Henning on a disputed stalling
call. He could surprise a lot of
people.

Ron White of Penn is unde-
feated and has to be considered,
as does Paul Wright of Cornell,
coming‘ down from 137.

137

‘  5 If Pete Vanderlofske (7-1), de-

fending champion at 145, comes
down a class, he will rate the
favorite role, but otherwise, the
title is virtually in doubt.
Pitt's Ron Schuchert (6-1-1),
Penn State’s Dave Spinda (7-2),

PENN STATE has several threats to take individual Eastern titles
' this weekend. Shown above (left to right) are Rich Lorenzo (191),

PAUL PADLAK
Harvard's Top Entry «

Temple’s Dave Pruzansky (8-3-
0), and John Homiak (8-2) of
F&M all rate a shot. Homiak
ﬁnished third here last year.

145
Again, if Vanderlofske wrest-
les here, he’s probably the fav-
orite, although he’ll be hard-
pressed by Vince Fitz (6-2-1) of
Penn State. Fitz ﬁnished as a

runner-up to Don New or Cor-

nell last year at 137.
Last year’s runner-up at 145,
Paul Arnow, is undefeated at

Vince Fitz (145), and Wally Clark (130). Other top Lions include

 

Jim Clair, F&M (9-2-0)

Princeton this season, but seems
to have been lost in the shuf-
ﬁe. One other wrestler, who’ll
be a threat according to Adams,
is Lehigh’s Elliott Tepper. Tep-
per hasn't had a real good dual
meet season, but reasons to be
tough in the tournament.

152
“I wouldn't want to single
anybody out here,” ventured

Adams, and it is easy to see
why. None of the candidates
stands out as a favorite for the
title.

Those wrestlers considered in-
clude Jim Clair (9-2) of Frank-
lin and Marshall, Russ Baker
(3-2-3) 01’ Army, Jed Olmstead
(6-1-2) of Penn, Tom Muir of
Lehigh, and Temple’s Steve
Alexander (9-0-2).

Clair placed in last year’s tour-
ney, but Alexander's record is
impressive.

160 ,

John Kent (7-1-1) looks like
the grappler to beat here, but
in his last dual meet he was
tied by Army's Mike Nardotti
(6-O-2).

“Kent is a good. tough kid,”
analyzed Adams. “At Navy he
sort of gets lost in the shuffle.
Nardotti is so-so. He's capable
of giving anybody a good fight,
but he’s not consistent.”

6 Adams also singled out Harv-
ard’s.Paul Padlak (6-1) for spe-
cial mention. He was third last

year. Adams emphasized that

    

Best Temple Bet
/.s\\  .

Padlak is tough and shouldn't
be counted out.
167
Again, there is no clear fav-
orite. If State’s Matt Kline (8-1)
doesn't wrestle at 160, he’ll be
a leading candidate. Bob Rust
(3-1-3) of Syracuse will be corn-
ing down from 177. He, and John
Dinger (7-1) of Army, will be
tough. ‘
Jack Bentz of Lehigh won by
a fall the last time out and
Navy’s Bob Ahrens (6-2), who
beat Dinger, have to be consi-
dered.
Joe Geeb is undefeated at
Penn.
177
Army's Jim Harter (7-0-2) de-
fends his Eastern crown this
weekend. His two draws were
with Jack Bentz and Bob Rust,
both of whom are competing at
167.

0) and Bob Funk of Penn State
(5-1-1) stand a good chance with
Harter. Penn’s Dave Labosky
(8-1) looks like a good dark-
horse candidate, especially if
the Quakers plan to finish in
the top ﬁve.
191

Rich Lorenzo (8-00) of Penn
State has won half of his bouts
with pins. He probably comes
closest to the dominant wrest-
ler of the tournament.

“He looks like the class of the
weight,” agreed Adams.

Still, several challengers must
be considered. Gene Detwiler of
Colgate was mentioned by
Adams at 191 or 177. Temple’s
Mike Beretz is 9-1-1 with three
pins, as is Julian McPhillips of
Princeton. Ron Ries of Lehigh
also deserves consideration.

HEAVYWEIGHT

Paul Raglin is probably the
leading candidate here. The
Army heavyweight is 6-1-1, los-
ing to no EIWA opponents. His
mcst important victory came
over Navy’s Mark Kane (5-10)
by a 12-3 margin.

However, Penn's heavyweight
is 245-pound Mike Hajjar, who
numbers six falls among his
eight wins. Then, too, Terry
Hoover, Pitt's entry is undefeat-
ed as a heavyweight, including
two pins. Lehigh’s Frank Pa-
quin should also score a few

points.

Father’s Mat Genius

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

Picture the developmental psychology professor lectur-
ing his class about the relationship between environment
and heredity.

“We know certain families have a history of genius.”
the prof drawls. “The Bachs of Austria had generations of
reknowned musicians, and the Russells of England had their
philosopher-statesmen.

“Now,” he pauses, “was their genius inherited or did it

,'r_:ome from their——

. “Hey, wait a minute,” blurts a wrestling fanatic from
the back row, who had been idly plotting the matchups for
this weekend’s Eastern Championships. “You forgot the
Peerys of Pitt.”

And so the professor humbly apologized. For although
the Peerys’ claim to genius is only two generations deep,
their prowess in collegiate wrestling is internationally ac-
claimed. '

____Back in the Depression Years, Rex Peery won three
NCAA titles for Oklahoma State, and then came to Pitt to
single-handedly build a wrestling program which became
a national power. Competing elsewhere, Rex’s son, Hugh
Peery won three national titles. Then from 1957-1959,
Rex’s son Ed duplicated the feat by winning three NCAA
championships under his father’s tutelage at Pitt.

Now Ed Peerv is the head coach at Navy. His team is

,the favorite to win the team championship in the Easterns.

Rex- on the other hand, is in semi-retirement as he saunters
between the Field House and his office in Trees Ha‘l. Fer
even though Rex retired three years ago, he can’t get wrest-
ling out of his life.

He will be one of three former coaches sitting on the
Board of Appeals during this weekend. In an unofficial ca-
pacity, you can safelv bet he’ll be closely appraising his son’s
team and Pitt’s wrestlers. not necessarily in that order.

Just last week, Rex drove down with the freshmen to
the Plebe Tournament at Navy put on by his son. Rex sat
with the Pitt bovs, lending them some of his experience, and
afterwards he chatted with Ed. 4

"I could see that Ed was getting concerned. about Pitt
already.” Rex related. “He saw fellows like Mark Payne and
Ralph Cindrich, and he told me it’s gonna take some figur-
ing to beat those boys. As the Navy coach. he could see he’ll
have his hands full a little sooner than he expected with

  ﬂaitt."

Ironically, it was a high recommendation from Ed
Peery which helped Dave Adams, then his. assistant at
Annapolis, to become Pitt’s coach. Rex bleieves that
Adams has done a “terrific job” this year and he doesn’t
discount Pitt’s chances in the Easterns.

“We have an old saying in Oklahoma,’ he revealed,
“which says ‘there never was a horse that couldn’t be rode
and there never was a man that couldn’t be throwed.”

Try to get Bertrand Russell to state that.

happy he's there, because he’s undefeated as a
heavyweight this season, with two pins.

TERRY HOOVER smiles “as he applies the guillo-
tine to Penn State’s 191-pound Jim Emmanuel.

between heavyweight a.ud 191, will compete at

 

“I thi'nk I can win the
thing,” was Terry Hoover’s
ﬁrst re-action after he was in-
formed by -coach Dave Adams
that he would wrestle heavy-
weight in the Easterns. Hoover
had been prepared to go at ei-
ther 191 or heavyweight, with
heavyweight being his clear
choice.

“It wa-s probably a combina-
tion of my preference for heavy-
weight and Tony Truitt’s bad
ankle which helped make the
-coach decide,” Ho-over said. “I

Hoover believes he could place
if he went at 191, but as he
pointed out, “There's no out-
standing heavyweight wrestler.
It’s the open spot of the tourna-
ment.

“It’ll take smart wrestling and
I'll have to be careful,” he con-
tinued, “but I still think I can
win.” 1

Hoover’s -overall record is 5-3-2
but he is 3-0-2 at heavyweight
with two pins. He can’t explain
it, but he feels more comfort-
able when the scales read 200
pounds.

  Illustrious
Mat History
For Varsity

In its 15 year history in
the EIWA Tournament, the
Panther wrestling team has
chad at least one individual cham-
pion but for the past two years.

Since, 1954, when the matmen
joined the Ea.-stern-s Association,
the team has had 22 champions.

During the team’s ﬁrst three
years of competition, the mat-
«men won the team title. They've
«had one other ﬂrst place ﬁnish,
four seconds, and one third

since, but have not won since

1960.

and later finished as runner-up to Caruso.

Only through a strange set of circumstances
did Burger ever become a wrestler at all. While

Toward Mat Stardom

By MIKE BROURMAN

Life is full of surprises for Mark Payne. For instance
last week he was named the most outstanding‘ wrestler at
the Navy Plebe Invitational.

“I was kinda shocked,” said the frosh star from Sid-
ney, New York. “They could have given the award to a lot
of people.” ‘

Wrestling coach Dave Adams was not surprised. He
has been predicting stardom for Payne all along. Last
week he came right out and said that Mark could win three
Eastern championships during the next three years‘.

“Did he?,” asked Mark. “The coach is awfully optimistic
anyway. I’d like to win three, but it’s a big battle in there.
Of course, the top guys in
my weight class are graduat-
ing.”

Just what the weight class
will be may be another sur-
prise. This year Mark has
been wrestling at 145 for
the freshmen, but he was
entered at 137 in the Invita-
tional.

“I had a little problem
making the weight,” he ad-
mitted. “It was an awfully
long week. I had to exer-
cise three or four hours the
day of the tourney. I guess
I made weight 15 minutes
before the "final weigh-ins.”

From, that hectic battle
with ca‘ories, Mark went on
to practically swarm through
all contenders in his division. He pinned two, wona 9-2 de-
cision, and captured the title with a 7-2 win.

Both pins came with the double grapevine, which
‘Mark called “my. favorite hold.” Despite its ominous
name, its object is not the complete dismemberment of
the opponent. “It’s just an over the body scissors with me
on top,’ Mark explained.

1 Next year, Adams has hinted that Mark will wrestle

MARK‘ PAYNE

at both 137 and 145. Just where will depend on the op- »

position. But, Mark doesn’t forsee any recurring trouble
making weight.

“I didn’t have much notice this time,’, he said. “Next
year I’ll know, and I’ll be able to spread it out more, so I
can get down easier. If I do go down, most of the time it’ll
be for the big tournaments and such.”

In those tournaments, Mark will be looking for an
opportunity to use the double grapevine, but he’ won’t
press too hard for it. “I’m usually qute conservative as a
wrestler,’’ he admitted. “I just wait for a mistake most
of the time. I use a» lot of counter-moves and leg moves.”

Even when he takes his man down, he doesn’t press
for the grapevine. “I use what comes up. I haven’t got
the strength to go for one move like a lot of guys can. I
just can’t hold on long enough.”

Mark started his wrestling career in Sidney, a central
New York town, in the sixth grade. Like many other ath-
letes, he took up his sport by chance, through an accident.

“I was in sixth grade when a new coach came to Sid-
ney and started a wrestling program. He wanted man-
agers, and he knew I had the grades so he asked me. I
got to work out with the varsity, and it just grew on me.
I really love it.” '

Sidney, which never had a wrestling team, grew to

love the sport as well. “It’s the wrestling capital of the

state now,” Mark said. “We won state three of the last

‘  four years.” Another wrestler from Sidney won the 177

pound title in the Plebe Invitational.

. As a senior, Mark had 20 or 30 college offers, and he
only got to Pitt in a roundabout way. “Coach Adams was
recruiting me for Navy, but I didn’t know whether I’d like
that military life, and I was undecided on a college. Then,

A A when he got the job here, he called me, and I came.’_’

As a student of wrestling, Mark followed last year’s
Easterns, and he knew that Pitt scored minus 2 points.

' “That made me a little bit apprehensive about coming
._»her,e,” he admitted, “but now I'm really glad that I came.

We re on our way up. With this coaching, I don't know
‘how we can go wrong.”

 

 

A  Stars Hold Key

   

Navy, and acted as the Middies top recruiter. The Plebes
that he enticed into going to Annapolis won six titles in
the annual Navy Plebe Invitational, the freshman equivalent to the

Easterns.

Now Adams is the Panther head coach, but his recruiting prowess
remains awesome. This year’s fresh grapplers captured two tourneys,
one officially and one unofficially, and they make the Panthers a
power to be reckoned with in the future.

In February the freshmen competed in the eight-team Michigan
lnvitational. Wrestling against the two perennial Big 10 powers,
.\/Iichigan and Michigan State, along with five other Ihidwestern
schools, the Cubs completely dominated the event.

Cubs Draw
High Praise
From Payne

The season may not be over
for the freshman wrestling team.
According to Mark Payne, they
are thinking about entering the
Stevens Tournament, an AAU
event.

“We “ should have a good
team,” Payne said. “The fresh-
man team is really surprising.”

“Look at Bob Kuhn, for in-
stance. He's only had one close
match this year.” Kuhn (160)
lost to Pat Lavery (152) in the
WPIAL championships last year.

“Pat got robbed down at
Navy,” Payne said. “He should
have been in the ﬁnals. The ref-
eree called a takedown for his
opponent with three seconds
left, and the guy really didn’t
have control.

“And,” Payne continued. “Bud-
dy Morris was the best 177
pounder ther-e, even thou-gh he
only weighs 150. He lost in over-
time, won his next match, and
then lost again in the last ﬁve
seconds. And he's been hurting
and just started working out
again last week. Otherwise, he
would have won.”

Gene Reese won the 167 title
at Navy. “He's good whenever
he gets tough,” Payne explain-

ed. “He got real aggressive and -

mauled the guy he was facing.
He pinned him in the second
period.”

Jack Hopkins (145) and heavy-
weight Ralph Cindrich were
both runnerups at Navy_ “Ralph
lost on a ﬂuke,” Payne explain-
ed. “He had beaten the kid 6-0
earlier and was ahead 6-1.
There’s no doubt that he was
the better wrestler.”

The 130 pounder for the team
at the Stevens Tourney will
probably be frosh coach Bob
Fehrs, three-time NCAA runner-
up at 123. “We’re trying to talk
him into it,” Payne admitted.

Yogis Return

“Fools rush in where angels
fear to tread,” the saying goes,
and nowhere are there bigger
fools than the Pitt News Yogis.

Not satisﬁed with their blun-
derings during football season,
the sages are going to com-
pound matters with Easterns
choices.

Holy double grapevine! A new
villian joins the Yogi crew.
Roy “Jumps-hot" Jacobs, arch-
ﬁend, joins Jay “Flatbush” Ros-
enstein, George “Moustachio”
Lies, and Mike “Hawk” Brour-
man in the unholiest quartet
since Pyramus and Thisbe, no

less.

They won ﬁve ,7 of the nine
weight classes to capture the
team title. Jack Hopkins (137),
Mark Payne (145), Pat Lavery
(152), Bob Kuhn (160), and
Ralph Cindrich (heavyweight)
were the individual champions.

Later, the Cubs met the Le-
high frosh in a dual meet. The
Little Engineers had won 15 in
a row over a two year span, but
the frous-h spoiled that skein with
a 19-14 victory.

Lehigh won the ﬁrst two
matches before the freshmen
took the lead with four wins
and a draw in the next ﬁve
classes. A draw by Tom Shil-
linger at 177, and a 9-1 win by
Cindrich over a previously un-
defeated 260 pounder clinched
the victory.

Last week the Cubs traveled
to Navy for the Plebe Invita-
tional. They returned with three
titles, two runnerups, and the
unofficial team title. Penn State
had the same number of win-
ners and runnerups, but the
frosh compiled more pin points.

And, co-ach Bob Fehrs ﬁelded
a team that was not up to par

physically. Buddy Morris, a New
Jersey state champion, had been
out with an injury and was
forced to wrestle at 177, 25
pounds over his normal weight
class. Still, he won one match
and lost two clouse decisions.

The freshmen may compete in
the Stevens Invitational later
this month. Otherwise, they are
through until next year, with
the possible exception of Mark
Payne, who may try out for the
Olympic team.

But, although they may not
compete, they won’t be idle.
Adams and Fehrs will see to
that. And next year, the Pan-
thers will be a contender for

Eastern supremacy once again.

But, the way Dave Adams re-

cruits, it won’t be the last time. ‘

F our Carry Mermen’s Eastern Hopes  

Lane, Price, Norris Twins
Chances Lie On 800 Relay

by ART ROSENGARTEN
With his first season at the helm of the swimming
team behind him, head coach Bill Grant eyes another per-

sonal first this week.

For the next three days, Grant will be piloting a small squad of
four swimmers in the Eastern Swimming Championships at Prince-
ton University.‘Co—captains and seniors John Lane and Chris Price,

and the junior Norris twins,
Howard and Richard, will be
battling for personal satisfac-
tion and a possible high ﬁnish
in the competition.

Grant enters this “ﬁrst” fair-

‘ ly optimistic. “With the boys

swimming in two relays and two
individual events, the chances of
a high placing by the swimmers
appears good,” ventured Grant.
“Probably our strongest event
 the 800-yard freestyle relay.”
With his third shot at East-
ern competition, John Lane is
the veteran on the team. Last
year he placed 11th out of 28
swimmers in the ﬁnals of the
500-yard freestyle event.

l‘HE NORRIS TWINS, Richard (left), Howard, will turn their talents
loose at the Easterns. Rich will be swimming in two individual med-
leys, while Howard takes to the water in the butterfly events.

This year, Lane will abandon
the freestyle and enter in the
200 and 400-yard individual med-
ley races. This will be the ﬁrst
time that Lane has swam the
individual medley in competi-
tion this season. Grant explains
this by saying, “John is such
an all-around ﬁne swimmer, that
with Rich Norris .and Chris
Price on the squad, I found
that I could shift John where-
ever I needed him and that was
mostly in the freestyle events.”

Behind Lane in Eastern exper-
ience is Howard Norris. In 1967,
Howard swam in the 100 and
200-yard butterﬂy events. He

will swim these same events
this year and Grant feels that
with that one year's experience
under his belt, he should be able
to reach the ﬁnals and notch a
high ﬁnish there.

The rookies on the squad are
Price and Rich Norris. Price
will be entered in the 200-yard
breaststroke and the 400-yard in-
dividual medley. This will be
P1-ice’s last chance to break the
Pitt record in the 200-yard
breaststroke, one that he has
been aiming for most of this
season.

Rich Norris will be joining
Lane in both the 200 and 400-
yard individual medleys. Grant
expects a ﬁne performance from
Norris and he feels that in these
two events, Norris will be able
to turn in his best performances
of the year.

All four of the boys will group
together and perform in both
‘the 800-yard freestyle relay and
the 400-yard medley relay.

Putting aside his preparations

I for the Easterns,lGrant was able

to reﬂect back upson his swim
team’s 3-9 season. “I knew the
situation that I was going to
face when I took the job and
there was nothing much I could

do to correct it this season,” he
said.

“On the other hand, I have to
take my hat off to the boys,” he
continued. “They knew their job
and they stuck with it week af-
ter week. Their amount of ded-
ication was just tremendous.
They never slacked off.”

At almost every meet, the
swimmerswere at a manpower-
disadvantage.

“We just couldn’t overcome
that lack of depth,” bemoaned
Grant. “We had some tremen-
dous quality performances, but
the lack of a strong number
two man cost us a few wins.”

An unusual occurrence haunt-
ed the swimmers throughout the
season. Wherever they swam,
their opponents recorded their
best times of the season and set
numerous team and pool rec-
ords. “I guess they felt that
beating Pitt was a feather in
their cap

 Grgurich Expects Frosh Cagers
To Improve Next Year’s Var

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Now that the freshman basketball season has ended,
each Cub should be given an award to remember. “We
Try Harder” buttons would be most appropriate.

“The kids have really come along,” suggested freshman basket-
ball coach Tim Grgurich. “They've had a lot of bad breaks, but they

never gave up.”

The first bad break was a
fracture in guard Pat McClel-
lan’s leg early in the season.
The injury shelved the Cubs’
sixth man for more than half
of the 12-game slate.

While McClellan was still
“walking” around with crutches,
forward Bob Gailus was shelved
for the season. He only got a
chance to play the first four
games. And the calcium depos-
its in his thigh have yet to be
cured.

The loss of Gailus could have
been a disaster for the Cubs.
Gailus, at 6-7, represented the
Cubs’ biggest man, and his ab-
sence hurt the Cubs’ rebound-
ing strength.

But the freshman hoopsters
kept hustling and won ﬁve of

the eight games that they play-

ed without the former Kiski
Area star. However, the plague
of bad breaks continued.

The Cubs lost a. close decision
to the West Virginia frosh at
the Field House. With five sec-
onds Ieft, Jeff Taylor, 12th man
on the Little Mountaineers
squad, sank three of four free
throws to sink the Cubs, 85-82.

“I thought we had that game
won," moaned Grgurich after
the defeat. “We played the same
way we did when we beat them
in West Virginia.” The win could
have changed the Cubs’ medio-

cre 7-5 record to 8-4, which looks
more impressive. ‘

Regardless of the injuries and
bad breaks that the freshman
cagers suffered, and regardless
of the 7-5 record that they ﬁn-
ished with, Grgurich still is orp-
timistic that the varsity will be
improved next year.

“We’re really coming along,"
explained Grgurich earlier
“When you add some ‘ of these
kids like Mike Caldwell and Bob
Gailus to this year’s sophomores
next year. we’re going to a lot
stronger.”

Whether or not the varsity
will be improved won't be known
until next year. But one thing
is certain; next year’s varsity
will have to try as hard, if not
harder, than this year’s fresh-
man team.
