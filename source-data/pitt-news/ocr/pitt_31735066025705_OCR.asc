ranked football star

NEW KENSINGTON For
Brandon Williams’ mother, the
ideal -choice would have been for
her son to attend the University of
Notre Dame this fall.

“Notre Dame was my first
choice for him” said Williams’
mother, Cheryl. “His father lives
nearby.” .

For Williams, the realistic
decision was to take his football
talents elsewhere. Somewhere
closer to home. Somewhere with-
out a page—long depth chart at run-
ning back.

Somewhere like the University
of Pittsburgh.

His mother relented.

“As far as Pitt,” shesaid, “I.

see how much opportunity they
will give him, and I’m feeling
great about being able to see him
play.” _

At a press conference Friday
afternoon in New Kensington,
Williams announced his intentions
to attend Pitt and play football
under Head Coach Walt Harris
next season.

Williams was one of western
Pennsylvania’s hottest recruits this
season, courted by football power-
houses UCLA, Ohio State and
Notre Dame. He visited Los
Angeles last weekend, but the 6-
foot running back chose not to
become a Trojan. He made his
decision two days before the con-
ference and kept it quiet until this
past Friday.

Students pay the price
for alcohol abuse

Bradley Swink
Staff Writer

A 21-gun salute is a graveside mili-
tary tradition honoring the death of a
fallen soldier. In 1994, Pitt pre-med stu-
dent Atif Bhatti died 16 shots of
whiskey into his salute.

While the military and the student
drinking population have contrasting
deﬁnitions of a 21—gun salute, both, as
in the case of Bhatti, are associated with
death.

Bhatti died Nov. 11, 1994, after
consuming 16 shots of whiskey in less
than an hour. He was celebrating his
21st birthday, and in doing so, attempt-
ed to drink 21 shots of hard liquor ——
the 21—gun salute.

The honor student, who was sched-
uled to interview at the University of
Arkansas School of Medicine, died
from a chronic alcohol overdose,
according to an Allegheny County coro-
ner’s office spokesperson.

Sadly, and put simply, Bhatti drank
too much.

Unfortunately, senseless alcohol-

related deaths
such as Bhatti’s
have become far
too common on
America’s college
campuses. James
Cox, though,
reminds us that _‘
alcohol and its -
accompanying
horrors should
not be viewed
from simply_ a
college campus
perspective.

of Pitt's Alcohol Advisory Committee

with Shirley Haberman,
“Alcoholism is a problem that touches
all aspects of society. Alcohol abuse is a
social problem."

Alcohol abuse on university cam-
puses, however, is arguably the most
serious kind of abuse, for it victirnizes
those who have yet to live and experi-
ence life fully.

“The kids,_ I believe, are hurt the
most. They’re too young to realize what

said, i

can happen from drinking.” said recov-
ering alcoholic Scott Landy, who is
training to become an alcoholcounselor
and sees alcohol as “the devil himself.”
According to the 43-year-old Landy,
“I’ve known at least this many college-
age kids” — Landy ﬂashed all of his
ﬁngers twice to count 20 — “who have
died alcohol-related deaths.”

Student research isn't just for gra si

Hillary Stevenson

 
 

Staff Writer

Dressed in baggy blue jeans and a
Rusted Root T—shirt, Rebecca Vislay
blends in with the crowd at her usual
hangout, The Beehive. But as soon as
she rattles off the words "deoxyribonu—
cleic acid" (a.k.a. DNA, the key to hered-
ity) in a way most people recite their gro-
cery lists, one easily senses that there is
something special about her.

"People think that I'm crazy, but I ,

could stare‘ at a diagram of DNA for
hours," she said while lounging on the
sofa in Pitt Professor James Pippas' biol-
ogy lab sipping her coffee.

‘ Vislay, a sophomore biology major,
is part of a research team under Pippas
that investigates the causes of cancer by
looking at mock cancer viruses. The
research is part of the groundwork for
future experiments that play a role in a
larger scientiﬁc quest: the cure for can-
cer.

"Right now, it's hard to saywhat we
want to accomplish with this experiment.

' It could go in many directions. Besides

working on this project,» I just want to see
how science works in reality, not how it
works in my head," Vislay said.

Vislay is not alone in her wish to see
how science really works. Hundreds of
biology, neuroscience, chemistry,
physics, astronomy, and computer sci-
ence majors are learning firsthand what
really happens in the science community.

' Typically, graduate students are the
ones inside the research labs, but under-
graduate students here at Pitt also partic-
ipate.

Along with Vislay, Andy Lutz, Alex
Paxson, 1 Amy Montague, Raphael
Morales, Grace Mitchell, Mike

Mulheam, and Gary Oden spend an
average of 20 hours a week in labs ana-
lyzing animal behavior, looking at com-
puter simulations of the universe, peek-
ing through microscopes or directing fel-
low undergraduate students in a chem-
istry lab. ' '

. . "[Research] is a marvelous way for
students to discover their ﬁeld,” said Dr.
Peter Koehler, dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences. “It gives them an
opportunity to see if an area is or isn't for
them  We have been involving under-
graduates in research for several years
now. You learn by doing, and in this case

.you see what you are learning about. It

enhances classwork."
Research projects are easy to find, if
students express interest in working.
"Faculty members are aware of the
importance of undergraduate research,
and we expect faculty members to
include students in their projects.

—-However," a student has to go and ask

‘What can I do?"' said Koehler.

Finding the perfect match between
student and research project takes time.

"We almost treat this like a real-life
job experience," said Stephen Meriney, a
neuroscience professor. "Faculty mem-
bers will interview the students for their
individual labs, and hopefully both the
student and faculty member will find a
good match. It's a big commitment to
take on a student." ,

Most students receive credit for their
research in the neuroscience department.
Some departments pay students who do
research during the summer, and others
make research a prerequisite for graduat-
ing with honors.

Seniors Lutz and Paxson, both neu-
roscience majors, agree that independent

President Clinton tells
cabinet not to worry

Across the Nation

WHITE HOUSE — President Clinton has
told his cabinet, “I’ll  ﬁne.”

_ That’s according to the cabinet secre-
taries who emerged from an hour—long meet-
ing to prepare for next week’s State of the
Union message.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
reports Clinton opened the session by reiter-
ating his denial that he had an aﬂ°air with a
White House intern, then told her to lie about
it under oath. . f

Albright says the president told them,
“stay focused,” and then launched into a
round-table discussion of policy issues.

Neither Albright nor the others who
spoke to reporters could say when Clinton
might answer more questions about the
scandal — as he says he wants to do.

CANHSRIDGE, Mass. — In the hallowed
halls of Harvard, the intellectual debate of
the day is about — toilet paper.

One-ply or two—ply, to be exact.

Dean of the College Harry Lewis has
armounced that in the future, two-ply toilet
paper will be used in undergraduate dormi-
tories and public restrooms. _

The changeover will occur as soon as

the current supply of one—ply is exhausted.

Freshman Ted Wright was elected to the

‘ student council this month after making two-

ply paper a major campaign issue.

In a recent column in the Harvard
Crimson newspaper, junior Geoﬂrey Upton
wrote that he doubted very much that Dean
Lewis went home every night to one-ply toi-
let paper. '

WASHINGTON — Monica Lewinsky’s
attorney says prosecutors have rejected a
deal for his client — and he says she’s a tar-
get of their probe. _

He’s also complaining about her treat-
ment by prosecutors and FBI agents._
Wlliarn Ginsburg says the former intern
was questioned in a hotel room for hours
without an attomey present.

Ginsburg says he’s trying to gain immu-
nity from prosecution for the former White
House intern, in exchange for her testimony.
But he says so far, investigators working for
Whitewater Special Prosecutor Kenneth
Starr have rejected the idea.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — One of the
Unabomber’s victims says he’s disappointed
that Theodore Kaczynski won’t get the death
penalty. .

Yale University computer scientist
David Gelemter says the death penalty is
supposed to be given to vicious terrorists -
and when it’s not, “It’s a tragedy for the
American people.” Gelemter had part of his
hand ripped away by a mail bomb.

In exchange for pleading guilty to the

Unabomber crimes, Kaczynski has been
spared the death penalty. Instead, he’ll spend
life in prison without the possibility of
parole.

Another victim who lost part of his
hand, University of Colorado Engineering
Professor John Hauser, says the plea indi-

cates Kaczynski wasn’t crazy. Hauser says .

he thinks Kaczynski realized he was looking
at death and decided to settle things.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — No one will be
prosecuted in the alleged hazing of two of
the ﬁrst women to attend the Citadel. .
That word comes from the Justice
Department, which found that some male
cadets were treated as harshly as the women.
Freshmen Jeannie Mentavlos and Kim
Messer left the South Carolina military col-
lege in 1996, saying they were hazed and
harassed and even had their clothes set aﬁre.
The Justice Department says the gov-
emment would _have to prove that someone
used force or threatened force to prevent the
women from attending the formerly all-male
school. But oﬂicials said that would be hard
to probe, because two male freshmen also

I had their clothes set on ﬁre.

Mentavlos is suing the school and oth-
ers in federal court. Messer is suing six male
cadets in state court, but did not name the
school as a defendant.

SAMARILLO, Texas — A plaintiif in the

beef—defamation lawsuit against Oprah
Wmfrey blames the TV talk—show host for a
1996 crash in cattle prices.

O’Brien testiﬁed that cattle prices
plunged immediately after a Winfrey pro-
gram on mad cow disease was broadcast on
April 16, 1996, costing cattlemen more than
$10 million. -

The jury also was shown a clip that was
edited out of the program — in which a mad
cow expert for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said he had just eaten beef in
Great Britain and would do so‘ again.

Wmﬁey told viewers she had stopped
eating hamburgers. '

She’s being sued for unspeciﬁed dam- 1

ages under a Texas law that holds people
liable for false and disparaging statements
about perishable food products.

Around the World

GAP, France — Some French media are
reporting a higher death toll in a deadly
avalanche. '

So far, oﬂicials report eight people dead,
two missing and 19 injured, though some
French media reports say 10 people were
killed.

Most of the hikers were teenagers. They
strayed oﬂ° marked trails in the French Alps.

Oﬂicials say they’ll search all night if
they have to for the missing hikers.

SGB lac ses on fulfilling campaign

.

Zachariah Blott
Managing Editor

The Student Government Board
said three weeks ago it would inter-
act with students directly to hear
their concerns, and so far the SGB
is doing just that.

"It's nice they're here to talk
with us," said sophomore Kimberly
Williams at the board's first Town
Hall meeting of the year. "They at
least seem like they care."

SGB held its first Town Hall
meeting — an occasionally—held
formal meeting intended for many
students to attend — ' last
Wednesday in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom. More than 100
students milled about, ate free pizza
and met the new SGB members.

Board member Elizabeth Klein
said an event this simple is impor-
tant for letting students know the
SGB will listen to their ideas.

"We want to hear all their com-
ments on changing things," she
said. "This is a way to do it  and
we're here ready to listen."

As students talked with each

other and enjoyed free food and
soda, the SGB members walked
throughout the crowd and talked to
practically everyone who attended.
While doing so, the eight board
members and SGB President Alyson
Wallach asked students to fill out a
sheet of paper with their names, e-
mail addresses and five suggestions
to improve Pitt.

And why did almost every stu-
dent comply so willingly? Because
the board members gave out a free
SGB/Pitt Pride T-shirt to anyone
who did.

"Just another day I don't need to
do laundry," said freshman David
Goldberg. "And it's not that hard to
find five things wrong with Pitt."

The T-‘shirts were the same that
last year's SGB handed out occa-
sionally, and Wallach said new ones
won't be printed until "these are ‘all
gone."

Comments on the question-
naires ranged from complaints
about the allocations process to a
call for more on-campus housing.

to act on all the students‘ sugges-

ORGANS

Of the 12,000 people medically suit-
able for organ donation annually, only
5,200 donate. Most decisions are made
by family members of brain—dead indi-
viduals whose identiﬁcation indicates
they’re organ donors.

UPMC spokeswoman Lisa Rossi
said, "The procurement team always tries
to contact the family. If there is a strong
objection to the donation they will con-
cede to the farnily’s wishes, but in
Pennsylvania, the law states that the team
can remove the organs immediately upon
notiﬁcation of death."

Ben Bellas, a senior an major, has
spoken to his parents about his wish to be
an organ donor, yet he doesn't carry any
identiﬁcation stating he is one.

"There's no way I'd carry a card
around stating I'll givepmy organs away.
If the paramedics saw that they'd let me
die," said Bellas.

Kevin Flynn, a senior psychology
major, whose Pennsylvania driver's
license has "organ donor" printed on it,
also said he believes that paramedics
would be more apt to let him die if he was
in an accident, especially if someone
important was high on the waiting list.

Marsh said the fear of organ donors
being left to die by medics is completely
unfounded. He added that paramedics
and doctors do everything in their power
to resuscitate patients and keep them
alive.

FROM PAGE 1

"The fact that doctors used to be the
ones asking people to become donors has

led to this unfortunate misconception that .

they would let a person die for organs. It's
unfounded, but understandable," Marsh
said with a sigh.

Because doctors’ close involvement
in the process raised questions, they now
have no interaction with possible donors.
Instead, organ-procurement organiza-
tions work closely with hospitals by com-
piling lists of donors, ﬁnding matches
across the nation and informing families
about donating. . .

Organ donation is a national under-
taking. The organs or tissue go where
they are best matched and most needed.
Organs that can be donated are the heart,
kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas and
intestines. Tissues such as bones, eyes,
skin, tendons and ligaments are also
transplanted.

It is important for organ donors to tell
their next of kin or a family doctor that
they wish to donate. Not all living wills or
written notiﬁcation will be acted on by
medics without the next of kin’s consent.

Marsh said the major reason for the
decrease in the number of donors is the
lack of knowledge about who is eligible
to donate and who to contact to find out
more.

For information about becoming an
organ donor, call CORE at 1-800-366-
6777.

ALCOHOL

overdose, after he was discovered
unconscious in his own vomit. Benjamin
Wynne, a Louisiana State University fra-
ternity pledge, died last August from
alcohol poisoning after a fraternity “Bid
Night.”

The far-reaching and nondiscrimi-
nating hand of student alcohol abuse has
again found its way to western
Pennsylvania, where two Indiana
University of Pennsylvania students died
only days apart. Like Kruger and
Wynne, the IUP students died from alco-
hol-related consequences.

Lorraine. Hanna, an 18-year-old
freshman from Butler County, died early
New Year's Day after a party. Indiana
County Coroner Thomas Streams said

mom PAGE 1

that the untold amount of alcohol in
Harma’s body slowly poisoned her.

Garret Bozylinsky was the second
student to die this year at IUP. Unlike
Hanna, he was thought to have ingested
a lethal cocktail of pills and alcohol.

On the IUP deaths, Pitt’s Cox stated
sympathetically, ‘‘It’s always sad, but
I’m relieved it didn’t happen here.”

To curtail alcohol-related tragedies,
most universities, including Pitt, have
established task forces to address the
problem.

Pitt’s Alcohol Advisory Committee,
which was created in 1994, emphasizes
the importance of drinking responsibly.

“We want to educate people about
being responsible. Through this educa-

tion, we hope to minimize the problem
on campus,” said Cox.

Cox also expressed the need for
local bar owners to ban underage
drinkers from their establishments.

“Campus police are working hard on
the problem, and the district justices are
imposing stricter ﬁnes on students.
Zelda’s was raided and closed because of
underagers,” Cox stated adamantly.

Some, however, are convinced that
more must be done. Andrea Draper, who
graduated from‘ Pitt last August, feels
that local bars must be more vigilant and
persistent concerning the problem of
underage drinking.

“It’s no secret to students what
Oakland bars permit underage drinking,”
she said. And the doormen, according to
Draper, are particularly tolerant of
“allowing underage girls into the bars.”

  What are we
supposed to think?

Bill Clinton has really thrown the country a curve on this
one. We don’t know what way to look.

Ever since newspapers around the country reported last
week that Clinton’s friend Vernon Jordan Jr. allegedly asked
a young White House ex-intem to lie about having a sexual
relationship with the president, the word “impeachment” has
ﬂown off the tongue of almost every American. '

But nobody seems to agree on what grounds, exactly, a
president should be impeached.

Among The Pitt News editorial board, for example, sev-
eral very different points of View have separated us.

Should the president be impeached for having an extra-
marital sexual relationship while in office? Some say yes, that
he is the moral leader of our country and will not be respect-
ed by his people nor the other nations towhom he represents
us. Others argue no, that he is our elected chief executive, not
our moral representative, and should not be legally barred
from having an extramarital affair while the rest of us are not.

Should the president be impeached if he ordered a mem-
ber of his staff to tell Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath, and in
effect, obstructed justice? There’s a bit more agreement on
this one, but it is still not complete. Most maintain that he
should be impeached if this claim is proven, that he -must
answer to the same law as the restof us. Fewer support the
notion that the president should, in some instances, be above
that law, that he should be ‘granted some special privileges if
it is in the best interest of the country, just as military com-
manders are allowed to bomb other countries and judges are
allowed to order the deaths of individuals though private eit-
izens are not. V - ' .

The only thing we really can agree on is that this scandal

could not have come at a worse time for Clinton or for the‘

whole country. As we stand on the brink of a possible military
strike against Iraq, any action Clinton takes, in any direction,
will be questioned by his people: Is he doing this to take the
attention off himself? Is he capable of making such a decision

under so much other pressure? Wﬂl his decision be morally .

sound? _

As a country, we must come to grips with these issues
very soon. We may not have imagined Clinton to be a priest
when we elected him a year ago, but we wanted him to run
our country. Does what came out last week really affect his
ability to do that, and if so, is it enough to take him out of
office? '

The dirty secret about printer backups

Henry a

Mason

“Where are the headquarters
of Computing and Information

- Services?”

“Uh, headquarters of what? ”
- “CIS. You know. ”

“Well, what part of CIS? ”

“The whole thing.”

“Oh Um. Why do you want to
know?” '

“I just want to know whose ass
to kick about this four-hour printer
backup. ”

“Huh. Yeah, uh, well, it really
isn ’t anybodyis fault, so there isn ’t
much they can do about it. Or us, for
that matter: ”

“Yeah  OK ”

I overheard the preceding con-

versation between a student who

was waiting for his overdue paper
and a lab consultant who is a very
good friend of mine but who shall
remainanonymous for various rea-
sons. His answer about the blame
for the printer backup was actually a
little white lie. More on that later.
It’s 9:00 p.m., Tuesday night I

_ am in the computing lab on the 10th

ﬂoor of Benedum Hall. This is The
Benedum Lab (that’s a capital T.
And a capital B), Warcraft Heaven
for gamers, Sing-Sing Penitentiary
for mechanical engineers, and the
Fifth Circle of Printer Hell for stu-
dents with ‘ overdue papers. We
won’t say, what it’s like for the lab
consultants.

For me? It’s home, that’s all.

There are 630 print jobs pend-
ing in the print queue, ‘for a grand
total of around 300 megs of print
data The four printers are just get-
ting around to jobs that went into the
queue at 5:00 p.m. There is a group

The Pitt News

of people sitting around the output
area. They look, well, unhappy.

So, as a public service to all stu-
dents who don’t have a P200 and a
600 dpi laser printer at home, I have
compiled a list of things to do that
will ensure that you never suffer
from printer backup syndrome
again. Ever.

1) Print out your e-mail. All of
it. Repeatedly. And . just to make
sure that you have enough copies,
print it again.

2) Instead of using theoptical V

character recognition software on
the scanner machines (that nifty
program that translates your scans
back into text) just scan your 50-
page document in as high—resolu-
tion tiﬂ‘ ﬁles, and print it out that

way. The massive size of the result- _

ing print ﬁle will ensure that your
job is given the highest priority. And
if anyone mentions a photocopier,
tell them to get lost.

3) Surf ﬂie web and ﬁnd all
sorts of high-resolution manga jpg
images and print them out during
peak printing hours. Almost as

, effective is to go to ESPNet or some

other graphic-intensive sports site
and print out the entire roster of your
favorite team complete with mug
shots and bios. The essential thing
here is to print in the middle of the
day when no one else is printing. No
one who matters, that is.

4) A Print out the Java
Developer’s Kit manuals. All 1,300
pages of them. Better yet, print two
copies. No, print three, and giv
them to your friends. , 4

5) Durnp core in Unix and pipe
it to the printers. You will know you
have been successful when you see
a lab consultant roaming the lab
with an aluminum baseball bat ask-
ing people if they are “jdkst57,” or

THE PITT NEWS

7

whatever your usemame is. If they
ask you, it’s the guy sitting next to
you. '

6) If you are a professor, make
sure that all your assignments are
online as high—resolution jpgs, and
tell all your students to print them
out. The bigger the class, the better
this works. ,

7) This last one applies in any
situation. If you don’t see your
printout appearing within 10 min-
utes, print your document again._
Ignore the signs that say that there is
a three hour wait _for printouts;

they’re just there to scare you. And

never ask to see if your job is in the
queue. .

If you follow these guidelines
scrupulously, you are guaranteed to
have a long and prosperous life in
the computing labs here at Pitt.- If
you put a sign on your back with
your usemarne on it, all the other
students will see it and look up to
you as an enviableexample of com-
puting etiquette. ' '

The consultants will love you,
too. .

Getting back to what I men-
tioned earlier — whose fault is it
that the printers get overloaded?

Oh, nobody’s. I was kidding.
Really, it’s just the hand of fate. I
heardonceﬂratithadtodowitlrtlre
moon’s gravitational pull.

Yeah, right

Play fair, be considerate, and

try to put oﬁ  that Perl man- '

ual until midnight. Everyone will be
a lot happier. Remember, the com-
puting labs are here for everyone.

Just don’t try to use the Spare
10s to check your mail.

henryj. mason isn ’t cynical. He isn ’t
angry. And most importantly, he
never said any of this.

I can’t believe Pitt is building a new
arena. I am so disgusted with Pitt it’s not
even funny. It is going to spend how much
money on a new arena, when the ﬁeld
house is perfectly ﬁne?

What Pitt really needs is more com-
muter parking lots. It can build a nice sized

set its sights on a new arena. Whoever we
pay to make these decisions should get
their priorities straight.

Why are the commuter lots that are
available so far away from the heart of
campus? Even if you park in some of these
lots, the shuttle is still needed to get to
class. I think that the school would make
more money on a commuter parking
garage than a new arena. Oh well, what
can a commuter do anyway? We are con-
sidered second-class students, and that’s

During fraternity rush, one can expect

to see ﬂyers covering nearly every wall
on campus. This semester, however, there
is an entirely new crop of signs that read
as follows: “Don’t let others think for
you. Don’t let others tell you what to
wear. Don’t pay for your friends. Don’t
give up your individuality. Don’t support
the Greek System. Don’t join a frat! ! !”

I found this sign disturbing for a nurn- ‘

ber of reasons. »
First, I have a problem with any ﬂyer
whose sole purpose is to steer students
awayfrom a University—sponsored activi-
ty. I may not agree with everything the
SGB or Pitt Program Council does, but I
would never consider putting up signs to
slander them. If people don’t agree with
fraternity life, that’s ﬁne. But such negative

low blow.

Does this school have a Fraternity
Defamation League that I am not aware
of? "I honestly carmot fathom a group of
students who found printing, distributing
and hanging these ﬂyers to be a productive
use of their time. I

I do respect that these ﬂyers clearly
state their authors’ feelings, but there are
more appropriate ways to deliver this mes-
sage than broad stereotypes and unsubstan-
tiated claims. Instead of downplaying the
Greek system, perhaps the signs could
have pointed out the beneﬁts of remaining
an independent. This would have done the
job without offending Greeks across the
campus. .

Also, I would wager that the authors of
this ﬂyer never have been apart of the
Greek system, or they would know that it
teaches responsibility, se1f—conﬁdence and
individuality, not uniformity, and that most
Greeks ﬁnd the system as positive and
rewarding as I did.

‘Maybe since I have seen both sides of
campus life (Greek and independent), I am

more qualiﬁed to speak on the subject than '
‘someone who refuses to ﬁnd out what

Greek life is really about. Maybe they
should take a gander at the other side and
then make an educated decision. Or maybe
they’ll just keep hanging anonymous signs
in the Cathedral.

Center could
save basketball
recruiting

For four years now, Pitt men’s bas-
ketball Head Coach Ralph Willard has
seen the same circle of events unfold
before his frustrated eyes. A blue-chip
high—school basketball player has nar-

rowed his list of potential playing grounds _
‘down to Pitt and some other program.

Then the player comes for a visit, and
that’s when Willard loses his battle.

He loses it not because the recruit has
anything against sidewalk bums.

Or because it’s overcast more than

. it’s sunny. .

Or because nine out of '10 restaurants
in Oakland have roaches.

No, none of these Oakland nuances
drive players away from Pitt.

The culprit is that 50-year-old 6,798-
seat airplane hangar that sits along
Allequippa Street just above Pitt Stadium.

It must have been difficult for Wﬂlard
to dance around the ﬁeld-house subject.
It’s half the size of most Division-I facili-
ties, and its locker rooms are small.

Show the recruit everything except
the oversized high—school gym, Willard
must have said to himself before every
recruit visited.

“Here, young man, let me show you
the Civic Arena where we play a couple
of times a year.”

Or maybe you want to see some of
the night life in Oakland.

“Did you know the Original Hot Dog
Shop is world—famous?” '

That’s how sad it was for Willard, but
then came Superman (Mark Nordenberg)
and his trusty sidekick, Steve Pederson, to
W1llard’s rescue. In a little more than a
year, they achieved what former
Chancellor J . Dennis O’Connor couldn’t
do for eons:

They got funding for a new, basket-
ball—only facility.

VV1th the name Iron City Center or the

Giant Eagle Arena (if it receives sponsor- '

ship), this 12,000-seat court could be
ready for play in three years. This is still
far off, but it shows a dedication to the
basketball program that Pitt hasn’t
demonstrated in years.

Now, thanks to this new Pitt regime,
Willard will finally be able to show what
kind of recruiter and coach he can be.
With a new facility sparkling in Pitt’s
future, Willard won’t be losing many
more battles to top college programs.

This is not to stay that Willard hasn’t
done well in his tenure here. His ﬁrst

Just one week ago, the Pitt Panthers took the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights into overtime and won 86-85 at the
Fitzgerald Field House. .

Yesterday, it was a different story. The men’s basket-
ball squad lost to Rutgers 87-65 ending the Knights four-
garne losing streak.

Pitt entered the contest after dropping a heart—breaking
double-overtime loss to St. John’s Thursday.

Rutgers controlled the game by connecting on nine
three—pointers. All ﬁve Rutgers starters fmished the game in
double ﬁgures, including 20 by senior forward Eric Clark,
20 by forward Rob Hodgson and'l9 by Jeff Greer, brother
of Panther Ricardo Greer.

. Rutgers ‘only yielded the lead once, when Pitt went up
4-3 after an Isaac Hawkins jumpshot. But Clark came right
back with a dunk that put the Knights up 5-4, and the
Knights would never look back. . .

Forthe Panthers, Issac Hawkins led the team in scor-
ing with 19 points. Vonteego Cummings was held to only

eight points, the ﬁrst time this season he failed to reach.

double ﬁgures. .
The three pointers began hitting for the Knights after

junior guard Geoff Billett hit a three-pointer, putting.

Rutgers up 15-6 after the ﬁrst six minutes of the game.

RECRUIT

   

FROM PAGE 1

Coaches, friends and about 20
members of the regional media were

7on hand as Williams, who was bat-

ztling the ﬂu, announced his deci-
sion." When Williams said “the
University of Pittsburgh”, the crowd
let out a collective “Yes!”

“Brandon is the single most
important recruit since Tony
§Dorsett,” said Ray White, Valley
High School head football coach
}who also attended the conference
j“He has a 3.6 grade point average,
;and he will never embarrass the
University. He is the best player
‘.l’ve ever had the opportunity to
coach.”

The 1997 Pittsburgh Post-
‘:Gazette Player of the Year led the
1-Valley High team to a winning
‘record while establishing personal
milestones. Williams is the 16th all-
time -Western Pennsylvania
Interscholastic Athletic League
rushing leader with 4,214 total
yards, averaging 10.2 yards per

season, Williams had 196 rushes for
1,945 yards this season, including
31 touchdowns.

Also a finalist I for- the
Pennsylvania Big’ 33 Player of the
:_-Year, Williams displayed his versa-
tility this season, playing at line-
backer for the Vikings and totaling
-54 tackles, seven sacks and two
interceptions.

‘ The senior, who is considered
one of the top 20 running backs in
:§:he country, is also a track athlete,

competing in ‘the 100—yard dash with '

'1 personal time of 11.0. His 40-yard
dash has been timed at 4.5 seconds.

Several factors influenced
Williams to attend’ Pitt," most

 

THE PITT NEWS

notably the fact that he would fit
into Harris’ offensive plans next
season with the departures of Billy
West and Dwayne Schulters.

“Coach Harris said that I would
be the first big recruit under his
belt,_” Williams said. “I’m looking
forward to trying to make my mark
next season.”

Pitt’s offensive game
appealed to Williams,
Schulters described it to him.

“The West Coast offense is the
best offense that will suit me,”
Williams said. , I

As far as making the decision to
attend Pitt, Williams said he made it
on his own. — °

He did, however, receive some
advice from his coach on how to
handle the rigors of the recruiting
process.

“I just talked to _ him about
what’s important, as far as integrity
and honesty,” White said about his
star running back. “I knew he had a
great sense of direction from his

family.”
icarry during his career. This past "

As far as _direction, Cheryl
Williams claimed little inﬂuence on
Pitt’s newest prodigy.

“I ‘ didn’t pressure Brandon at
all,” his mother said. “I enjoyed the
process. It gave us a chance to see
other schools and help Brandon nar-
row his choices.”

Now that Williams has finalized
his decision to attend Pitt, he will
begin preparing for his freshman
year as part of what may finish up as
a top 25 recruiting class.

“I feel that we are on our way
up, and who knows what could hap-
pen next year,” Williams said. “I
don’t have any real expectations for
next season, except to do to the best
of my abilities.”

To put that in perspective, consider this:
On Saturday, Pitt got 12 points just from the
two pinfalls. That’s the same number of
points Ohio State collected in all four of its
wins combined.

Mengerink’s pin came with 1:45 left in
the first period of the matchup at the 167-
pound weight class.

“I just caught him on his back,”
Mengerink said. “I got him on a low—single
[takedown maneuver] and I was just trying
to get the [takedown], and I ended up getting
the pin.”

Bodo didn’t feel like waiting a whole
minute for his pin. He cradled Ohio State’s
Donovan True and collected the fall just 58
seconds into the matchup at 190.

“It’s exciting because I don’t get too
many pins,” Bodo said of the fall, which was
just the third of his college career.

The pins were the highlight of
Saturday’s contest, but the entire Panther
lineup wrestled a solid match.

“We had a real great week of practice,”
Stottlemyer said. “It’s good to see the hard
work pay 0 .”

The Buckeyes jumped out to an early 3-

FROM PAGE 9

0 lead with Matt Fratta’s minor-decision win ’

at 118. Pitt’s Rob Loper evened the score at
tlnee with his 8-5 victory at 126.

Pitt freshman Blaise Mucci, ﬁlling in for
an injured Chad Jesko, turned in a valiant
perfonnance for a loss in the 134-pound
weight class. ‘

Mucci took on Jelf Bucher, who is
ranked sixth in the nation. Bucher controlled

Rob Loper (on bottom) earned a rninor-decision victory over OSU's

most of the match, but Mucci picked up a
reversal (worth two points) in the match’s
final seconds to cut Bucher’s lead to six. That
preserved the minor-decision victory and
saved the Panthers one team point.

Mike Ziska’s 4-1 win at 142 knotted the
team score at 6, and Brian Pardini’s win at
150 put Pitt ahead by three.

“I was pretty happy with how I wres-
tled,” Pardini explained. “I was upset that I
gave up two points at the end, but I’m happy
with a 4-3 win.”

Jake Schaus won a 1-0 nail-biter at 158

Mengerink’s pin at 167 sealed the victo-

of the best grapplers in the nation at 177.

Pitt’s John VV1throw, ranked third in the

More Panther Recruiting: Pitt
football courts Purifoy, Chapman

Brett Simon

Staff Writer

Florida  Syracuse...
Notre Dame  Tennessee 
UCLA  and Pitt? Most Pitt
fans would agree it would
be unthinkable to mention
the Pittsburgh Panthers in
the same sentence with
these top football powers.
However, a new era is upon
the Panthers — at least,
according to the most recent
batch of Pitt recruits.

-Two of the best recruits
in the nation from the
Pittsburgh area had Pitt on
their lists of potential
schools. Usually Penn State
has scooped up these
recruits by now, but with
Pitt’s resurgence last year,
the Panthers are making a
strong showing in the
recruiting war. «

One of those two stand-
outs —- Valley High
School’s. Brandon Williams,
a 6-foot, 200-pound running

back —— has already chosen
Pitt. Amir Purifoy, a 6-
foot—2, 220-pound line-
backer fullback from Steel
Valley, was scheduled to
visit Penn State this week-
end. However, Purifoy has
narrowedlhis choices down
to Pitt, Wisconsin,
Tennessee, and Penn State,
and will reportedly make
his decision later this week.

Pitt has made offers to
other top recruits, who
haven’t yet made their deci-
sions. One of them is Jay
Chapman from Washington,
D.C. Chapman is consider-
ing Pitt, Florida, Syracuse
and Indiana. He runs a 4.4-
second 40-yard dash and
earned All-Metro honors

- last season.

One top recruit has
made his decision —— Pitt
beat out Washington State
and USC to grab receiver
Latief-Grimm. Grimm, a 6-
foot, l80—pound wideout, is
considered one of the top

in the country by various.

recruiting agencies.

Pitt has also re-signed
Kiawatha “Ki” Downey,
who signed last year and
was unable to make grade
requirements. Downey, a 6-
foot-4 340-pound offensive
lineman, is from North
Carolina.

Downey rounds out the
five new 300-pounders on
the offensive and defensive
lines, including_ Bryan
Anderson, John Raymond
(a redshirt freshman), Mike
White ‘(a transfer from IUP
who enrolled in 1997 but
sat out last year due to
NCAA rules), and Dan
Cornelius, a 300-pounder
from Golden West Junior
College.

The Panthers also suc-
cessfully recruited Mark
Brown from Saddleback
Junior College in California
to help bolster their offen-
sive line.

Hoops

Ricardo Greer brought Pitt back
with six points in four minutes.
Rutgers opened up its otfense
again by moving the ball well along
the perimeter, looking for the open
shot. Jeff Greer followed up with
two consecutive shot blocks off his
brother that turned into points for
the Knights. Hodgson hit two three-

FROM PAGE 9

pointers for Rutgers that sent the-

team into a 39-29 halftime lead.
In the second half, Pitt used a
man-to-man press defense that

forced Rutgers to search for the

open man under the-basket.

The Knights did just that. They
passed the ball well down low and
found Clark often for the point. As
the offense opened up for the
Knights, so did the lead. Two con-
secutive three-pointers put the
Knights up by 21 with just over 11
minutes left to play. Pitt could not
close the gap for the rest of the con-
test. '

Jeff Greer sealed the victory
with "a reverse dunk in the ﬁnal min-
utes of the game. ' _

Pitt Head Coach Ralph Willard
commented that the St. John’s loss
had an effect on Pitt’s game. '

“We’ve been down since the St.
John’s game,” Willard said. “If we
win the St. John’s game, this is a

totally different game. Give Rutgers-

credit. They shot the ball well, and

13

we had no answer for Clark.”

Willard also wasn’t happy with
the Panthers’ style of oﬂense.

“It wasn’t their defense that
beat us, it was our offense,” he said.
“We settled for too many bad
threes. We were 0-9 in the ﬁrst half.
The focus was to go inside obvious-
ly, we didn’t do a good job of fol-
lowing a game plan.”

The loss yesterday was the
Panthers’ worst since the ‘95-96
season, when Villanova beat them
by 33 points. ,

Last week, the Panthers suf-
fered a different kind of painful loss
—— a 90-83 double-overtime defeat
at the hands of the Red Storm.
Cummings put in 27 points in 49
minutes of action, to lead all scor-
ers.

ﬁnal buzzer, and both teams scored
eight in the ﬁrst overtime to prolong
play. But, despite an early exit from
star guard Felipe Lopez, who fouled
out with only seven points, the Red
Storm went on "a 15-8 run in the sec-
ond extra frame to clinch the win.

Pitt’s next game is basketball’s
version of the Backyard Brawl — a
matchup versus West Virginia at
7:30 on Wednesday. The game will
be at the Civic Arena.

“They’re going to press us the
whole game, so fatigue is going to
be a factor,” said iWillard. The

WVU contest will be Pitt’s third '

game of the week.
