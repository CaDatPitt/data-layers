UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Attorney Louis Caplan
Gets Honorary Degree
From Law School

Louis Caplan, well-known Pittsburgh attorney and the
former president of the Allegheny County Bar Association
has received an. honorary doctor of laws degree from the
University. The award was presented to Caplan by Acting
Chancellor Stanton C. Crawford in a private ceremony

Thursday.

Caplan received his law de-
gree from the University’s Law
School in 1912, and has prac-
ticed throughout his life in Pitts-
burgh. For many years he has
been a member of the Judicial
Conference for the Third Judicial
Circuit of the United States.

He has been active in many

philanthropic and educational ac-

tivities and was the founder and
ﬁrst president of the United Jew-
ish Fund of Pittsburgh. He is
also a life trustee of the Federa-
tion of Jewish Philanthropies of
Pittsburgh. In the ﬁeld of edu-
cation, Caplan has set up a schol-

arship awarded yearly to a high .

school senior from the Pittsburgh
area “who has demonstrated out-
standing leadership in the promo-

tion of harmony among his class-

mates regardless of race or re-
ligion."

Caplan served in the United
States Army during World War
1. During World War II he was
appointed by the United States
Attorney General as a member of
the Alien Enemy Hearing Board
for Western Pennsylvania.

The University's Louis Caplan

Distinguished Lectures in Law
Series was endowed in 1962 by
friends of the attorney to honor
his service as a long-time mem-
ber of the bar and his leadership
in philanthropy and civic endea-
vour. The lecturers in the series
have been such men as Thurgood
Marshall, Solicitor General of the
United States; Nicholas Katzen-
bach, the Attorney General of
the United States; former New
York governor Thomas E. Dewey;
and Archibold Cox, the former
Solicitor General of the United
States.

MARTY ENGELS
Exhorts Mamdami

In their ﬁrst confrontation of the Stu-
dent Government (SG) election, the three
SG presidential candidates debated campus
issues last Thursday night over campus ra-
dio station WPGH.

‘Most of the hour program was taken up
by heated debate between Pitt Progressive
Party candidate (PPP) Mahmood Mamdami
and independent candidate Marty Engels.
Students United for Responsible Expres-
sion’s (SURE) Ralph Manning avoided most
of the conﬂict.

Engels questions Mamdami on several of
PPP policies. Engels pointed out that for
the second year in a row the PPP has had
a plank in their platform promising they
will try to get special commuter student
rates on buses.

“If -you couldn’t pass this last year,” En-
gels qucried, “How will you be able to ac-
complish it next year?”

Mamdami then argued that the PPP was
a minority party last year and was unable
to pass legislation because they lacked votes.
Mamdami did not elaborate on the bus is-
sue, which was never discussed in the sen-
ate last year;

‘Mamdami asked a similar question of

on student purchases -at the Book‘ Center. A

Engels answered back with a “speciﬁc
approach” whereby students would show

their All-Purpose ID cards atthe Book. .Cen-   

ter and escape the tax in this manner. ,
Engels pointed out that the University
legal department could negotiate for the
exemptions. The legal department has had
the sales tax lifted in the snack bars and
other areas restricted to student use.
Manningfelt that SG had been run by
a minority last year and that these senators
ignored what students wanted. He ' looked
forward to a senate where senators would

no longer “distort their opinions for their‘

own selﬁsh interests.” ».

The PPP’s illegal distribution of cam-
paign materials in the Towers also came up
for discussion. Mamdami admitted they
knew of the MDC rule of distribution of

literature and they broke the rules “for’the 

ideals we believe in.”

Engels urged that in such a situation that
instead of breaking a rule there should be
a spirit of cooperation where all three can-

didates would have worked together to have . -

the rule changed. He pointed out in the
meantime the PPP could have used the

Engels, concerning the sales tax exemption campus mail service to distribute materials. , ‘

Former Economics Head

Named US. Committee Aid

Dr. Benjamin Chinitz, former
chairman of the Department of
Economics at the University, has
been appointed deputy assistant
secretary of commerce for eco-
nomic development.

He will help Assistant Secre-

, tar-y Eugene P. Foley to coordi-

nate the programs of the Eco-
nomic Development Administra-
tion‘ (EDA) and the Office of Re-
gional Economic Development

(ORED). The EDA is the succes-

sor agency to the Area Redevelop-
ment Administration. The ORED
was established to work with

 
 

regional planning commissions on
multi-state economic problems.
Dr. Chinitz’ appointment was
announced by Secretary of Com-
merce John Connor who called

him “one of the nation’s out-.

standing authorities on regional
development.” -

As associate director of the
Center for Regional Economic
Studies, Dr. Chinitz made a study
of the Appalachian Region, which

contributed to the enactment of _

the Appalachian Regional Devel-
opment Act by Congress last
year. ' ~ '

(The second article in a series on
the platforms of Student Govern.
ment candidates.)

Both the Pitt Progressive Par-
ty and the Marty Engels-Bill Ler-
ach Independent ticket have ex-
pressed their hope for changes

ty library and the University
Health Center. The student park-
ing problem was another point
covered in their party platforms
issued this week.

> University Library

Engels has suggested that there
be a test ﬁle in the University
library. Here, in one centralized
file, students would be able ‘to
look over past exams.

The PPP has called for ex-
tended library hours that “def-
initely suite the academic needs
of undergraduate and graduate

"C students.”

> University Health Service
Engels feels that health serv-

dents too sick to go to the Health
Center. In practically all cases,

in the operation of. the Universi-

ice doctors should call. on stu-.

students are presently required

to go to the Health Service of-
fice in Brackenridge Hall.

The PPP advocates “a— drastic
increase” in the service of the
Health Center.” Like Engels, they
feel there should be emergency
house calls to dormitory students.
They also call for full-time fa-
cilities for necessary transporta-
tion to specialists and a doctor-
on-call at all times. I

> Student Parking Facilities

Engels suggests that students
would receive a City-University
decal to put on their cars. This
decal would exempt them from
overtime parking tickets in Oak-
land during class hours.

The PPP asks that city officials
consider utilization of trimester
stickers for student's cars, where-
by students may park their cars

in the general university area

without violation. They also ask
for passes for commuting stu-
dents whereby they may receive

a discount on bus. and trolley ,

fares.

- _Conceming other issues, En-

gels .feel~ that.;_there should be

“.t_bp-level” entertainment -at‘.
,, Homecoming; _ which i would per-'

.- ..

form in an auditorium rather

than in the Common Room of ‘ 

the Cathedral. He feels this could
be accomplished through an “ear-
ly and substantial” appropriation
to the Homecoming Committee. \

Engels feels students should
only have to sign one’-term dorm-
itory contracts instead of the
present two trimester contract.
He feels course catalogues should
be written so as to say what “the

course really contains.” He also It

suggests the names of all pro-
fessors should "be listed by their
courses in the time schedule.

Miss Edwards.

  man Library  
Progresses on Schedule

By NANCY FUCHS _

_ Construction of the $12 million Hillman Library 1S pro-

gressing on schedule‘ according to the contractor. The ﬁve-

face the entrance to Carnegie Li-
‘brary will be open in September, 1967. . .

The new library will be able to hold one and a half mil-

lion volumes. The open stack library on the ground ﬂoor 0i

and Alldred Room was $183,166.

The library plans to print a
book catalog, a card catalog in
book form’now in use in many
libraries. ’A card catalog would
still be /necessary to update the
book catalog. There are also
hopes to have an automatic
charging system.

“The library will conduct many
studies on automation and adopt
those which seem logical," Miss
Edwards explained. “We are in
an age where libraries are mak-
ing more use of computers. This
is a direction in which Pitt wants
to go. Automation speeds things
up. Much of the work is routine
in nature’and can be done by a
computer.”

Conduits are. being installed in
Hillman Library to make it possi-
ble to use some techniques of
automation and to link the li-
brary with__ the Computer Data
and Processing Center. A

“The University should be able
to acquire more books once the
library has more space,” Miss Ed-
wards said. The library has not
been able to buy many addition-
al books in anticipation of mov-
ing to Hillman Library because
it does not have the space in the
Cathedral to put them.

 86 Campaign - - Wrong Direction?

_ The blitz is on. This is the ﬁnal week of campaigning for Student Government (SG)
offices and the candidates are issuing their views in a never-ending stream of forums,
mimeoed sheets, radio broadcasts and posters.

V Yet there remains the never-answered question: What does it all mean? Marty En-
gels and Mahmood Mamdami spent the better part of an hour Thursday on a WPGH broad-
asttrying to establish whether the Pitt Progressive.Party or the ABLE Party (Engel’s
ormer party) caused the failure of Student Goverment. Their debate was occasionally
diverted by comments of the other candidate, Ralph Manning.
7 Both Engels and Mamdami deserve praise for their ability to articulate their
views and their polish in debate. Manning also deserves praise for his ability to break the
monotony of the two debaters.
Now ends the applause. The debating was ﬁne, the idea of a forum ﬁne, but utility
as minimal. Engels and Mamdami both issued platforms which emphasized primarily
(overworked issues. They reinforced their regressive ‘image by engaging in the same non-

ense over radio.

Instead of using the forums, radio broadcasts, and mimeoed material as means of
-«chastizing one another, all three candidates should talk about the revision needed in the
maciated body known as Student Government. «. . e

V They concentrate on the past not the future. They talk of the failures, not the im-
provements. They verbalize well, but say little...
As the ﬁnal charges begin the students should stiffen their test of the candidates.

"(They should see whether the long lists of extra-curricular activities of each candidate
iare anything more than words on paper. They should see whether these candidates, though

., The patient has made his
iappoint after numerous con-
:sultations. Will the surgeon
‘_ perate? Will the patient re-
[cover or will the doctor pock-
set his fees over the open
wound?
. In June of last year, the
patient, the University need-
'._ed relief of a headache, found
it was having pain of $19.5
million debt. The only cure
at the time seemed the es-
tablishment of a State Uni-
vérsity of Western Pennsyl-
vania. The cost: the private
status of the University. the
proﬁt to the state doctor: a
well - established University
ready to admit all those
"Western Pennsylvanians de-
siring an education.
There was a change in the
patient in July. The doctors
_*weren’t sure what it meant
5 but they ‘gave the patient a
$5 million pill to tide him
.‘ over.
‘ THEN SUDDENLY in
December the diagnosis
changed. The doctor found a
cure which would “solve
:Pitt’s problems” or was it
the doctor’s it was solving?
"And what about harmful
‘side effects?
‘The Prescription has been
,. hanged from state-hood to
state-relatedness. The ﬁrst
dose to be administered by
the _. 1966 State Legislature
 (which may deal only with
fﬁscal matters) consists of
‘money to pay much of the

 tuition now paid by students.
“Dose one will not give im-

mediate relief, but the hope
is that highly capable stu-
dents, unable to afford the
present tuition will be at-
‘tracted by lower costs.
, The second dose, the ac-
‘-tual state-related status can
only‘ be prescribed by the
Governor for administering
:by a special session of the
legislature. Dose two will
provide actual appropriations
;.,rather than state loans for
élgeneral maintenance and ex-

fDansion,-      

  

The side effects are dan-
gerous, but not insurmount-
able. Another patient, Tem-
ple University, has been
forced to charge out-of-state

- students three times its low-

ered tuition. Can the Univer-
sity afford the loss of oppor-
tunities for mingling of stu-
dents from different areas
which would result? Can it
take the chance that, forced
to draw students only from
Pennsylvania, its standards
of admission would have to
go down?»C_an it, if the pre-
diction of an additional 1,-
000 or more students is cor-
rect, assume the costs of
$600 per student which is
not covered by tuition but
paid by the institution? Can
it ﬁnd facilities for teaching
and housing? ,
DR. DAVID Kurtzman,
vice- chancellor of ﬁnance,
stated that the school would
accept’ no plan with the "out-
of—state stipulation, that
hopefully the current ratio
of out-of-state to Pennsyl-
vania students would not
change. Without fur-ther

    Who’s Lau

Everyone these days seems
to know how a Polack ties

his shoes or how many Po-s

lacks it takes to change a
lightbulb. But few know that
the Polack joke actually goes
far back into the history of
t h e S1 a v i c
Peoples.
Around the
time when
the Roman
Empire was
falling, South
Central Eur-
ope was in-
habited by
the Romani-
ans who spoke
Romanian,_ the Slavs who

 

CIKOSKI

spoke Slavic, and the Hun-'

garians who spoke Finnish.
Among the Slavs were many

subtribes who until this time -

had gotten along very well,
give or take a few broken
heads.

‘One day in 917, a wander-
ing minstrel from the lively
tribe "known as the Bouncing
Czechs came into the domain
of the only clean- shaven

Slavs, the Barber Poles, and,

demanded to know where the
action was. Ski -King, the
leader of the Poles, was
impressed by this bravado
and he told the Czech that if
he could make the King
laugh he would win the hand
of Princess Stuffed Cabbage.

SINCE THE Czech was

 

ghirig

madly in love with the Prin-
cess, he told the King the
funniest joke in all the land
of the Czechs: How Poles
Make Popcorn. Instead of be-
ing amused the King was
enraged and he drew his ra-
zor-sharp kolbassi and slew
the Czech on the spot.

The King. also declared
war on the Czechs. So the
Czechs declared war on the
Poles. Not to be outdone, the
Serbs attacked the Croatians,
the Dalmatians attacked the
Serbs, and just about every-
one massacred the ' Bulgari-
ans.

In fact, until recently every
Slavic group has hated one
or another of the rest, and
no social club picnic was com-
plete without a few grenades
being tossed around.

~- BUT ALL that has
changed. All Slavs are. broth-
ers, and no hard feelings
from the “Old Country” car-
ry over to America. Just last
Week the Czech Bowling
League invited the Polish
Bowling League to a ban-
quet. The Czechs showed
their brotherhood by enter-
taining the Poles with the
Czech national pasttiine,

By MAHMOOD MAMDAMI
The Student Government last year spent most of its
time on the Allocations Committee issue. As I ‘and
other members of the Pitt Progressive Party (PPP) have

consistently maintained, Student Government, since it

represents the entire student body, as well as the repre-
sentatives of major student organizations, should be the
only student organization to make decisionsfor the en-
tire student body.

Various student organizations did need money at
the time, and it was therefore essential to allocate it
as early as possible. Thus,, compromise was essential at

_ that particular time (Sept. 20). In fact, John Ruskay,
the PPP chairman, did go before Miss Rush to suggest
a compromise ‘plan. The senators ‘agreed to go along
with her if she approved (1) that the appointment of
the committee would only be temporary, and (2) that
the debate would go on in the senate until a satisfac-
tory permanent solution could be ‘reached.

I believe the compromise would have earned more
weight and merit had it come from the Student Govern-
'ment president than from the senator. One of the basic
failings of the ' president was the inability to achieve
effective communication between the students and the
administration. — .
The debate over, the Allocations Committee revealed
a basic need to expand the legal channels. The answer
would be the new Student Government constitution,
. which establishes a University Review Board, composed
of three situdent representatives, three members of the

faculty, and three members of the administration, to .

have the right to review in cases of disputed academic,
legal, or disciplinary decisions. é

\

Other problems were approved as the free speech

by MDC ruling, the’ high prices at the University Book-
store, the parking and transportation problem, and the
existing social regulations. -

The parking and transportation problem is unique
in that it requires bargaining with city officials. The
solution, trimester tickets for parkingand bus and frol-.
ley discount for commuters, could be achieved thru per-
sonal consultation by the president with the City Mayor.

The case could be further stressed byrequesting the.

parents of every commuting student to write to the
Mayor expressing their concern- over the situation. '

While both the PPP and Marty Engels claim to have
deplored the situation in this past year’s Student. Gov-
ernment, let us not forget that.’ the two factions both
created and perpetuated the farce in the senate. It is

' fine to deplore things at election time. But these election

time laments do the students little good.

Concerning the two factions opposing me in this
election, despite what they claim they would have
done, or should! have done, for were “blocked” from
doing in this past year, I hope the students will remem-
ber what they did do about the solution. Absolutely
NOTHING. ’

Despite their claims of inability to provide a solu-
tion to these problems, the following are the steps I
would have taken. ,

1. I would not have agreed to the Allocations Com-
mittee compromise offered, by the administration, in
the first place. It was an action taken illegally by Mr.
Stern, since he had no powerto speak for the Senate
in this matter. I would have upheld the decision of

the Senate in demanding SG, selection of the entire -

Allocations Committee.

2. Above all else, once it became inevitable that
it was possible to attain only the administration's pro-
posals, I would have accepted the best deal possible for
the students and not stubbornly have wasted the stu-

dents’ time, thus delaying the allocation of the funds.

It’s not what SG talks about achieving, but what it
achieves that counts. ' ‘
3. I would have ‘established a Liberal Arts’ Cabinet

. in March rather than delaying until November.

4. I would have stayed at the University during the
spring trimester ‘of last year.

5. I would have maintained enough control over the
senate to be able to name the chairman of Winter
Weekend and Homecoming much earlier than last year.
A better Homecoming would have been possible.

6. My main goal this ‘past year would have been
to uphold the best interest of the majority of the stu-
dents. Each issue would have been decided upon the
interest and desires of the students," without the great
preoccupation with what the administration, thinks,

whichiwas so prevalent last year. I would have been

Eric Stern sawhis election to the Student Govern

of the students who elected him. Yet he twisted these ,
admirable goals into a personal power play. Eric Stern“
was big on wind and little on action. Dogmatic and un
willing to compromise, his actions reduced SG to ‘

Lovett Scores 21

Hoopstersi Bad Second Half
Gives Buclmell 66-57 Win

By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Bucknell didn’t have to use the pressing defense that
stymied the Panther basketball team against Westminster.
Their normal defense was enough to stop the hoopsters,

66-57.

“We couldn’t buy a basket in‘ the second half,” said
coach Bob Timmons after the game. The halftime score

showed the cagers in front at
30-25. But when the teams came
back after the intermission, the

game turned around.

“Not only cou1dn’t we" score
during the second half,” added
Timmons, “we couldn't force
them into making mistakes either.
We stayed close until the last
six minutes of the game, then
their outside shooting  ﬁnally
killed us.

“As soon as Buckne'.ll started
to hit from the outside,” he con-
tinued, “there was nothing we
could do.” One reason why there
was nothing the Panthers could
do was that their own, shooting
_was'so atrocious. '

In fact, the hoopsters could
only manage 22 for 57 from the
floor, which is 38 per cent. Bob
Lovett was an exception as he
led the Panthers with 21 points,
nine of 16-from the ﬁeld. “Lov-

ett has had two good shooting.

games in a row,” Timmons noted.

But Lovett’s proliﬁc scoring
wasn’t enough this time. The
hoopsters were also beaten on
the boards, according to Tim-
mons. “Bucknell’s Nat McMoni-
gle controlled the backboards,”
he said. The 6-6 junior did just
that. He pulled in 16 rebounds
while scoring 22 points.

The loss to Bucknell brought
the Panthers’ record to 4-8. Three
of the defeats have come on the
three Saturday night away games.
Fortunately for the hoopsters,
only one such game remains on
the schedule.

Timmons has felt that the main

problem for the Panthers to solve
is the inability to play consis-
tently for 40 minutes. “We can’t
seem to play a whole ball game,”
he said. “We’l1 play good for the
ﬁrst half and then fall apart in
the second.

“Oh,” Timmons continued, “our
offense clicks and our defense
falters,'and vice versa. In the
past two games, the second half
has hurt us. We salvaged the
Westminster game but not the
Bucknell game.” ’

A frightening statistic to con-
cern the hoopsters is Penn State's
luck ‘against Bucknell. The Nit-
tany Lions beat Bucknell by 40
points. The concern will mani-
fest itself this Saturday in Uni-
versity Park as the Panthers
meet State.

The hoopsters have all week
to get ready for the Lions.
There’s no doubt that to stop
Carver Clinton andcompany the
cagers must put together a “whole
ball game” as Timmons terms it.

“It’s no picnic when a visiting
team plays at State,” he said. No
picnic or not, the Panthers can
make a good account for them-
selves if they can play a com-
plete basketball game.

Matmen Handed 15 Quick Points
By Orangemen.’s Three Forfeits

By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports? Editor‘

By looking at the 27-9 score, it couldsbe said that the wrestling team‘ posted a
strong win over defending‘ Eastern champion Syracuse last Saturday. _

But What the score doesn’t tell is that that the Wrestlers had an almost insurmount-
able 15 point lead before the referee- even signaled the first match to begin. Because of
exams and injuries the Orange forfeited the .123, 191 and heavyweight divisions.

“Our 123 pounder had two exams yesterday and was supposed to ﬂy in for the" meet
but he never made it,” said Syracuse coach Ed Carlin. “If he had been able to wrestle I
think we would have won that class. Our 191 man broke his arm in football and the heavy-

weight dislocated his shoulder.

One of the best matches of the

day came. in the 1'77 pound class ’ 5

with Randy Kahlor facing Syra-
cuse’s Tom Schlendorf. Schlen-
dorf was the runner-up last year
in the Easterns in the same
weight class;

The first two periods ended in
a 0-0 tie. In the ﬁnal period with
Kahlor on top Schlendorf notch-
ed one point for an escape. Then
Kahlor came right back with a
two point take down. After that,
though, it was simply a matter of

time with Schlendorf winning,:

6-2.

Carlin, whose complaints about
rising academic standards and
lack of athletic scholarships made
him sound more like he belonged
