Marche/rs Stage Peaceful

by PAUL STOLLER
(See editorial, “A Matter
of Principle,” Page 4)

About 80 persons protest-
ing against the presence of
Dow Chemical Co. recruiters
braved the cold wind, 35
counter demonstrators, and
50 frozen spectators yester-
day in front of the Student
Union.

The protest group was a mot-
ley crew. The group ranged
from University students and
faculty t-o nuns and priests.
There was even a young mother
who marched while carrying her
baby.

The demonstration was or-
ganized by the University chap-
ter of Students fo-r Peace (SFP).
It. was designed to protest
against Dow Chemical, the sole
producer of the napalm which
is presently used in Vietnam.
SFP charged that napalm is an
illegal weapon.

Dr. Jonathan Harris, assistant
professor of political science at
the University, said he had no
objections to any recruiters on
campus. “I am marching today
to make my objections to the
activities of Dow.”

“It is a strange thing,” said
Father Clharles Owen Rice,
“when a university cooperates
with -the industrial military com-
plex. This demonstration is a
most sensible thing.” .

In response to the demonstra-
tion, Dow stated: “We respect
the right of P people to protest
peacefully against an action
with which they disagree. How-
ever, our company has made

the decision to continue to pro-
duce napalm and other materi-
als as long as they are needed
by our governmen .”

A group of some 35 counter
demonstrators took sides with
Dow. “Dow has as much right
as anyone‘ to come on this cam-
pus and recruit,” said one
spokesman. “The Dow represen-
tatives should not be classiﬁed
as warmongers.”

“These demonstrations have a
prediliction for negative acts,”
said one spectator. “This feck-

less demonstration will do lit-
tle -to stop the war. If they were
truly interested in peace, they
would seek out more construc-
tive channels.”

Near the end of the demon-
stration, Dr. James Holland, as-
sistant professor of psychology,
challenged the Dow recruiter to
come down and debate the is-
sue. Dr. Arthur Tuden, associ-
ate professor of anthropology,
followed Holland by calling the
University community a “house
of ill-repute."

Pittsburgh Editors Talk
At Panel Discussions
Involving Free Press

by DIANE BLOCII

“How is a free press re-
lated to a free people?” was
the focus of a panel discus-
sion presented by the Pitts-
bulrgh Committee on South
Africa, Monday night.

Participants in the discussion
were Frank Hawkins, editor of
the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette;
Charles Robb, editor of the Pitts-
burgh Point; Noel Roternan,
news editor of the Jewish Chron-
icle; and Terrence Brock, edi-
tor of the Pittsburgh Catholic.
The discussion was moderated
by Nancy van Vuuren, coordi-
nator for the committee.

The panel discussed the diffi-
culty of presenting the public
with a true representation of
the news. The concept of la. free
press is a relatively new one.
“Free press in the world is the
exception rather than the rule,”
stated Hawkins.

The panel related the problem
of accurate reporting of the
news with the problem in South
Africa. Forces inside South Af-
rica do not have power to effect
changes, therefore, the world
press should attempt tohave an
effect on South African policy.

However, the panel stressed
that the essence of a free press
is to reﬂect fully the events
which concern the community.
This is often difficult to do effi-
ciently; Frequently a quote may
be taken out of context or space
for an article may -be scarce.

“Reporting is a very percari-
ows occupation,” said 

Each different person will re-
port the same event differently.

The problem of apartheid, the
total separation of Negroes and
white, in South Africa could be
compared with the race problem
of the US, according to the pan-
el. Tne difference is that South
Africa is no changing and, there-
fore, may be considered a dull
subject for American newspa-
pers.

""l‘.he American press is a
most narcissistic association,"
said Brock. “Readers just don't
respond to articles about news
censorship in South Africa.”

The panel realized the diffi-
culty in making the American
public aware of the situation in
South Africa, no matter now
ana.-logouls it is with the US
«problem. This is because editors
have the job of selecting, news
which will be of  in-
terest to the average reader.

Psychology Professor Decries Secret Researchi

Faculty Sets Meeting Tomorrow
To Discuss University’s Policy

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

“Secret Research has no
place in a University com-
munity where the emphasis
should be on the free atmos-
phere of knowledge,” says
Dr. James G. Holland, asso-
ciate professor of psychol-
ogy at the University. Dr.
Holland has based his views
on his recent investigation of
the secret research projects be-
ing maintained by the Univer-
sity in Washington, D. C.

“The faculty of the Universi-
ty are largely ignorant of this
activity," according to Dr. Hol-
land. “Of persons we have ask-
ed, almost no one knew any-
thing of the Washington, D. C.,
research office,” he added.

Faculty members will meet
to-morrow to debate whether or
not secret research will be al-
lowed to continue on the Uni-
versity campus.

Three positions wlll be dis-
cussed, am-xording  Holland.
Either the University will abol-
lish secret research completely,

or the faculty will consider it
unwise to get rid of the present
research policy. The third alter-
native is to do nothing and leave
policy to discretion of individual
units on campus. “It is inevit-
able that the University will do
something to ban secret re-
search,” stressed Holland.

He also stated that “all the
.better universities are abolish-
ing secret research and want
nothing to do wit-h it.” Recent-
ly there have been extensive
demonstrations on many cam-
puses by students and faculty
protesting the presence of gov-
ernment classiﬁed projects.

After a two-year dispute on
the University of Pennsylvania
campus, classiﬁed research con-
tracts were cancelled. During
that dispute some professors
threatened to wear gas masks
to commencemen-t exercises.

Malcolm Moos, president of
the University of Minnesota,
summed up the matter by say-
lng, “Unless we were on the
verge of World War II, I don't
think I’d favor secret research
at a university."

The faculty of the  of
the Natural Sciences adopted a.
policy statement on classiﬁed
research in 1966, stating that
“this university shall not nor-
mally undertake any research
or development project whose
objectives and results may not
be fu-lly revealed." The state-
ment also mentions that “excep-
tional circumstances may arise
in which the University feels
obligated, in fulﬁlling its respon-
sibility to society, to engage in
projects requiring secrecy."

The University has two close-
ly related classiﬁed research
projects. These are located in -an
office in Washington, D. C. They
are, respectively, the University
of Pittsburgh Ordinance Re-
search Staff and the University
of Pittsburgh Army Material Re-
search staff. These staffs work
on contracts with military com-
mand. They are responsible for
technical writing and historical
research reports as well as for
manuals of weapons. They work
on “everything from fuses to
missiles,” said Holland.

of the projects estimates that
approximately 20 per cent of
their operart=ion's dealt with
chemical-biological warfare, and
40 per cent of the projects were
classified. '

Classiﬁed research means se-
curity clearance for all person-
nel involved. This immediately

poses several problems. Holland
points out that his procedure
“permits the government to put
on a requirement of political
orthodoxy as a criteria ilor em-
ployment.”

Holland also said that he feels

New ‘Culture’ lnhaloits Haight-Ashloury 
Original Hippies Lost Sandra Brown, Dr. Delany View
2111 Movement Growth Coast’s Hippie Phenomenon

The hippie movement grew
tremendously. “Summecr hippies”
and “weekend hippies” became
more common than the real
thing, and, of course, all came
from the middle class. That so
many people found it so easy
to shift roles back and forth
made it clear that the real is-
sue in the hippie movement was
not middle class imm-orality, as
the h-ippxies claimed, but middle

— class boredom. Who wanted to

stay at home watching TV when
you could go outside and re-
ceive stimulation from psyche-
delic lights? Marijuana was pop-
ular for the .s-imple reason that
it could turn the most prosaic
of atmospvheres into an inter-

. esting one.

;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.

Lost in the shuffle were the
original hippies and the ideals
they believed in. “C-otmmrunity”
‘became four or ﬁve people hold-
ing hands ‘together. “T ruxth” be-
came whatever you thought of
when you were high. And
“grooving together” became an
excuse to avoid the conﬂ-icts be-
tween people that lead to un-

’ derstanding.

So what have the hippies con-
tributed? They have, hopefully,
dispelled a few myths about the

evil powers of marijuana. They -

have opened up a new world in
clothing styles and popular mu-
sic. _They have made non-vio-
lence the creed of thousands, and
perhaps also they have made
middle class society a little more
conscious’ of its own hypocrisy.
It is apparent the hippie move-
ment will not last, if for no
other reason than that people
usually become uncomfortable
a.fter living with a myth for a

while.

 

by BETH LAZERICK

“Hippies are not ‘hip’;
they’re straight,” is the ob-
servation of Mrs. Sandra
Brown, a Pittsburgh house-
wife, and free lance writer,
who together with a Uni-
versity sociology professor re-
ported their individual studies
of the San Francisco Haivght-
Aaszhubury hippies.

Mrs. Brown and Dr. William
Delany, who separately spent
part of last summer in Haight-
A-shbusry, disclosed their obser-
vations at a dinner meeting of
the U-nivensiity Counseling Spe-
cial Fellowship Program last
‘week in the Student Union.

Mrs. Brown estimated that 90
per cent o-f all hippies were
“plastic hippies,” to whom the
mass media gives a sterotyped
image. The real hippie, or the
10 per cent hard-core hippie, ac-
cording to Mrs. Brown, is not
dirty, does not walk around
nude, and is hard working.

“The hard-core hippie avoids
dirt even in‘ the food he eats; he
lives on a diet of macrobiotic
(grain) foods and acrobiotic
(vegetable) foods. It is too cold
in San Francisco to go around
naked,” Mrs. Brown clariﬁed.
One group did walk around
without underwear, but they
wore so much heavy outer cloth-
ing that unless you were told
what they were doing, you would
not notice anythingstrange, Mrs.
Brown related. She cited an ex-
ample of hippies who are re-
pairing the con_(le_r_r_1_1_1gg _l39_i_1g_LI9_-

one to ‘crash’ for the night.”

Dr. Lelaney, in his analysis of
the hippie, compared him to the
court of jester of medieval times.
He indicated, “The hippy is the
number one human interest
story of the mass media,” and
that he is similar to the jester
because people laugh ‘at him and
make fun of him.

Another myth Mrs. Brown re-
futed is that the hardcore hip-
pie is a “drop out.” “Actually
they are vitally interested in the
n-attion. That is why -they went

to Washington, D. C., to voice 

their concern over the country’s
foreign ‘policy.

“The difference between the
hippies and the beatniks is
LSD,” Mrs. Brown related. LSD
is the hippie’s vehicle to leam-
ing more about himself. The
tlrug is taken “to open minds to
what the real world is about,
to the end of trying to live hon-
estly and openly.

“I’m not in favor of the drug.
I saw too many bad things,”
Mrs. Brown said, murmurin-g
the last phrase in a whisper.
“Before you take the drug, see
someone ‘freak - out.” Freaking

out is having a bad trip with
the LSD. N 0 one knows when a
bad trip is coming, and even if
you have made many success-
ful trips, the next one could be
disastrous,” she continued.

The pl-ace to meet the real
hardcore hippie is in a Psycho-
delic Ashram. An Ashram is a
community center where people
live, sleep, and eat, Mrs. Brown
disclosed.

In‘ contrast to Mrs. Brown,
whom the hippies accepted more
generally as a friend, Dr. De-
lany was an observer. He cirted
ﬁve reasons for comparing the
hippie -to the court jester: First,
-the outward appearance of the
hippie boasts of the “colorful
mocking costume” that the jes-
ter wore. Also, the hippie is
‘‘full of inﬁnite pranks,” as the
jester always was. “The sad wis-
dom of the jester in the medie-
val days” is much like what the
hippie is trying to convey to the
20th century. There is a “crea-
tive irresponsibility” in the hip-
pie ‘life like that of the jester.
Lastly, he pointed out, one sees
“an uncouthness portrayed
through the media.”

University Professor Argues

ROTC Should Be Abolishedl

by DON MARBURY
“I should have been
against ROTC a long time

ago,” said Dr. James H014

land, associate professor of
psychlology at the Univers-
ity, “because it’s so out of
step with University policy.”
Holland advocated that ROTC
should be abolished on college
campuses at a meeting of the
Free University Draft Courses
on Wednesday.

Dr. Holland began by staying '

that ROTC’s biggest sins was
that “it tries to take on the
-trimmings of an «academic
course.” He pointed out numer-
-ous differences between it and
other courses. “ROTC is the
only course in which you -have
to sign an oath saying you are
not a member -of certain or-
ganizationvs, thus placing a re-
quirement of political ortho-
doxy. It .is also the only course
I know of,” he continued, “that
can use inducements to d-raw
students into it, such as the
$40 a month pay, plus other
scholarships. I bet if I could do
this in my psychology classes
they would increase."
Continuing, Dr. Hollamdpoint
ed out how strange he thought
it was that a pefson could be
appointed by the military to the
iiaculty of a iuniversxity, and how

— with [this appointrnen.t went the

title of Professor of Military
Science with full faculty priv-
ileges.
Holland said that even ROTC’s
self - justiﬁcations were false.
“The military uses the reason
that every male US citizen has
an obligation to serve their coun-
try. This is a big lie. There are
an awful lot of college grad-
uates who do not serve. They
can get defermcnts for being

conscientious objectors, for cer-
tain religious beliefs, and if they
plan to go into certain occupa-
tions.”

He asked, "If physical educa-
tion is a requirement for grad-
uation, why should you get out
of it for ROTC. Either it is re-
quired or no," he said. “An-
other thing,” he went on, “if
you accept one of those scholar-
ships they offer, you have to
serve an extra two years on ac-
tive duty. I thought the law
against indentured servitude
had gone into effect long ago.”

Dr. Holland felt that all these
rthinsgs show that ROTC’s mo-
tives are really enlistment and
Iindoctrinati-on -towards the mil-
itary. “If this wasn’t the case,
and their motive is really the
creation of more capable offi-

cers, as they claim, a college
gmaduate could go to Officers
Candidate School, and in a few
months come out with the same
skills that it would have taken
-him four years to acquire in
ROT ."

Dr. Holland is a sympathizer
of Students for Peace, and he
believes that their purpose is
worthwhile.

Concluding, he suggested what
sh-ou'l~d be done with ROTC.
“There courses should not ‘be
listed in regular cousrse catc-
logue-3. ROTC activities should
not be associated with the Uni-
versity, and no academic credit
should be given for ROTC
courses. Only‘ when these things
are done,” he continued, “can

this ‘rape, and subversion of

H’

the university cease.

A Matter of Principle

Dow Chemical recruiters appeared on campus yesterday for the
ﬁrst time this year; they were greeted by approximately 80 protesters.
The two-hour demonstration that was an orderly one, and unlike similar
protests -on other campuses, no incidents occurred. The demonstrators

had a point to make, and they made it.

There is no question that they had the right to protest. Their rea-
soning was that Dow Chemical is the sole producer of napalm, which is
presently being used by the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam.
The Students for Peace charged that napalm is an illegal weapon. They
._ felt that for this reason the Dow recruiters should not be permitted on

campus.

To put the entire issue in what we feel is the proper perspective,
we would like to quote verbatim a statement issued by former Chancellor
Edward H. Litchﬁeld. Dr. Litchﬁeld made the following remarks, which
he entitled “A Matter of Principal,” in the Spring of 1961. His comments
followed a four-month investigation of Associate History Professor Rob-
ert Colodny, concerning what were later proved to be false allegations by

* the press and the State Legislature that he was pro-Communist:

“You will be among the ﬁrst to understand ‘that an American uni-
versity is by deﬁnition a place of free inquiry. It is not a government
bureau, nor an industrial corporation, nor a church. Its role in a society

ferred with his peers, should have tried established channels for just con-

sideration of my claim, and otherwise should have exhausted all of the

ﬂourish.

The Right To Recruit

by Alice Goldsmith

Anti-war protest and dis-
sent over the war in Viet-

nam are nothing new on

college campuses. One new
type of demonstration in re-
ggnt Weeks has been the

eamphs -‘pi-‘6t‘é‘s-ts which ‘re-

strict the recruitment by in-
dustrial organizations sym-
pathetic to the government’s
position, particularly the
Dow Chemical Company.
Some people believe that
escalation of the war must
be met by the escalation of

protests. I can not under-

stand the logic in this state-
ment. Nor can I compre-
hend why University of Io-
wa demonstrators blocked
a building where Naval Re-
cruiters were to hold inter-
views or why Brown Uni-
versity students interfered
with the plans of a CIA re-
cruiter or why 21 Dow Chem-
ical representative was vir-
tually held prisoner for sev-
en hours in a Harvard Uni-
versity room. The list of
such mishaps is, of course,
endless.

One of the basic doctrines
supported by the Students
for Peace (SFP) at the Uni-
versity is that the basic
rights of the individual
should be upheld in con-
conjunction with the first

amendment of the United
States Constitution which
assures the freedom A of
speech, of press, of religion
and the-right of assembly
and of’ petition.

‘By demanding that “the
“invitation” to Dow should
be withdrawn immediately,
do not the Students for
Peace question Dow’s right
or freedom of assembly?
Members of SFP may ob-

ject to Dow Chemical “com-

ing to the campus to recruit
employees.” But I am sure
some University students
and faculty members object
to the formulation of SFP
itself.

Yet these students who
may be opposed to Dow have
not demanded the extinction
of radical organizations, be-
cause they uphold the belief
that dissent should be en-
couraged by the University
as a means of helping the
University fulfill its role as
a free and open society.
Thus the existence of the
academic community lies in
the concept of a free mar-
ket place of ideas.

Although it is true that
“the University is a place
for debate,” as was men-
tioned in one SFP article,

has the right to decide
whether they will engage
in political debate, or not.
Their prime purpose for
visiting the campus is to
recruit new employees and
not to determine the moral
responsibility of’ the Viet-
nam War.

Dow Chemical should not
be criticized by SFP for
“taking a political stand
supporting the government”
just because company
spokesmen have released

the statement that they “be- ,

lieve in fulfilling their re-
sponsibility to the national
commitment of a democrat-
ic society.”

Is it true that any com-
pany which supplies goods
used in the military effort
should be censured‘? If so,
Goodrich Tire, Humble Oil,
and Pittsburgh Steel should
also be blamed, because they
produce materials which
are used in the production
of airplanes and other vital
industries.

Of course, Dow Chemical
was singled out, because
anti-war protestors feel they
can focus on napalm. Na-
palm is a very emotional
product. It is rather diffi-
cult to get those opposed to
the Vietnam War excited
about the building of an air-
plane.

Although Napalm ac-
counts for only one-half of
one per cent of Dow’s world-
wide sale of over one billion
dollar, it has made little
difference to anti-Dow dem-
onstrators. The basic fact
that Dow Chemical produc-
es over eight hundred non.
military items does not
seem to be of importance to
the many demonstrators.

Thus the bitter anti-Dow
protests reflect the pro-
f'ound changes in U.S. atti-
tudes toward patriotism and
the American capitalist sys-

  
 

vehicles and remedies of an orderly society.”

In light of Dr. Litchﬁeld’s commentary, we must state that We be-
lieve the protesters have incorrectly perceived the role of a university.
We are by no means condemning their cause, as we View the protest as
essentially one against the war in Vietnam, however, we do feel that they
have not in way helped a worthwhile cause by protesting Dow’s right to
recruit on campus. This indirect method of protesting the war serves to
distract from rather than illuminate the» reasons for protest against the
war. In an effort to improve our society, yesterday’s pro-testors should try

' to avoid infringing upon the atmosphere necessary to allow truth to

Chem Students
Challenge Dow,

Editor, The Pitt News:

In light of the intense con-
trovensy accompanying Dow
Chemical} Company"s job recruit-
ment campaign o-n this campus
Nov. 14 and 15, we feel that it
may be useful to underscore
certain facts concerning Dow
and their product, napalm, and
make clear our own attitude to-
ward such recruitment.

Napalm was invented during
World War II by Dr. Louis F.
Fieser of Harvard. The deci-
sion at Harvard to disengage it-
self from secret research was
partially prompted by the real-
izartion tfhalt napalm——-a product
which offers no conceivable pos-
itive beneﬁt for humanity —
was ﬁrst invented there.

Napalrn-B, as produced by
Dow, is composed of 25 per cent
benzene, 25 per cent gasoline,
and 50 per cent polystyrene. Na-
palm-B is considered an im-
provement over older versions
of napalm because of its im-
proved adhesive qualities, pro-
longed burning time, and high
burning temperature.

A 165gallo~n can of napalm-B
when dropped from aircnaft cre-
ates a splash of ﬁre which in-
cinerates anyone within a 2,-
50(}squiare yard area. The heat
from such a ﬁre splash is so in-
‘tense that all oxygen in the im-
mediate area is quickly con-
sumed. People ountsaide the area
of incinenation will probably
sustain third degree burns over
large portions of their bodies.
M-any of these people will die
from carbon monoxide poison-
ing, shock, infection, and cardio-
vascular collapse due to panic
and burns. Bomb shelters are
useless again-st napalm attackas
since the occupants shrivel up
a-s if they were baked in an
oven.

The properties of napalm were

-discussed recently in the New

England Journal of Medicine,
where it was judged that “in-
cendiary bombing is potentially
as destructive as atomic war.

stirtuent of nlaipalm-M), is pre-
sently expanding its Louisiana
division by about 38 per cent.

Three new plants will be built

at Plaquemine, La., and ﬁve
others will be expanded for in-
creased production of polymers.

Dow is believed to be the only
supplier of napalm-B for the
Department of Defense. Current
production of napalm-B is 50
million pounds a month——ne~ar-
ly as much as was used yearly
during World War H.

Dow will also modernize and
start up its hallf-idle magnesium
capacity at Freeport, Texas.
This is the third magnesium ca-
pacity increase by Dow in three
years. Magnesium -is a wartime
metal used in the mvanuiiacture
of incendiary bombs.

Dow _insis1Js, however, that its
proﬁts on war material are
small, nevertheless, Dow’s spec-
tacular exspansion seems to cor-
respond with expansion of the
Vietnam war.

Dow recruiters, who -are guests
of the University, signed 1,310
job contracts with students in
the past year (1966). Other
than issuing a short, standard
staltement, the Dow representa-
tives are instructed by their
company not to engage in any
discussion concerning their
product, napa1m——a weapon ban-
ned by international -law.

We understand the Universi-
ty's desire to procure employ-
ment for its graduates. How-
ever, when there seems to be
serious question regarding a
ﬁrm’.s practices, we believe the
ﬁrm in question should be re-
quested to defend and/or make
clear its position to the univer-
sity community alt an open, pub-
lic discussion. If such a ﬁrm re-
fuses, then perm-ission t-o re-
cruit at the University should
be -denied.

Dow’s practices are clearly
questioned by many people on
campus. In view of Dowﬁs stat-
ed reluctance to debate, we feel
that this ﬂnm should not be per-
mitted on campus,

Questions SFP
Editor, The Pitt News: ‘

This letter i-s addressed'to’the
Students for Peace (SFP) as
the group which endorsed an
open letter to the Placement Of-
ﬁce, written by four members
of the Chemistry Department.

I‘ would like to question the
validity of the objections posed
by the SFP to visits from rep-
resentatives from the «Dow
Chemical Corporation. , 

It appears that having , estab-
lished their right to use the
campus as a center for their ac-
tivities, the SFP are now at-
tempting to encroach on the
ri.ghts of individuals to present
oapposing views to interested
persons.

Apparently the SFP consider
themselves a vigilante commit-
tee, who must look after the
mora-1 an-d physical well-bein-g
of the less fortunate -members
of the student body who have
not yet seen the light. To this
there must be an objection.
While the SFP sincerely be-
lieve, at least morally, in their
position, the question of moral
right and wrong must in most
cases be leﬁt to the individual.
Should the position of the SFP
be supported by the Placement
Bureau, a large number of in-
terested students would be de-
prived of the right and privilege
to choose the direction of their
own future.

The SFP have said that it is
only a privilege, which may be
extended or retracted at will,
that allows recruiters to use
facilities -of the University. I
protest, and say that this is not
a privilege, but a right, which
must be extended to aiil_repre-
senta-tives equally, regardless of
prejudice. Justice Black said in
1946, “The more an owner for

property for use by the public
=in general, the more do his
rights become circumscribed by

the startutory and constitution —

all rights -of those who use it
. . .” (March v. Alabama; 326
US 501.) In other words, the
more one allows his property
to become a forum or meeting
place for the public, the more

the owner's rights to discrim--

inate among, and control the
actions of -these vi-sitors be-
comes restricted by the statu-
tory and constitutional rights
of these vi-sitors. Anala.-gouslly,
the more the University allows
some companies to recruit on
campus, the less right the Uni-

- versity has to arbitrarily ex-

clude other companies. For these
other companies would be de-
prived of the right of freedom
of speech, and the right of equal
protection of the laws.

Until it can be proven law
or logic that Dow Chemical Clor-
poration is abs-olurtely wrong
and immoral, the University
cannot and should not deny the
right of this company to recruit
-on the same basis as any other
company. .

Rebuts Lee

Editor, The Pitt News:

Professor Lee in his letter of
Nov. 8, “An Open Letter to a
Dissenting Student,” expressed
the opinion that a group, re-
gardless of whether it is “righrt
or Wrong .in its views” should
not en-gage in certain acts of civ-
il d.‘isobed‘ience which ‘he con-
sidered “the tyranny of a min-
ority.” Although I realize the
danger of civil disobedience that
Prof. Lee refers to in our so-
ciety, I can not agree with his
position.

unjust use ofpower or author-
ity. Civil disobedience is the
breaking of the law to estab-
lish, recover or redress one’-s
private and civil rights. Acts
considered tyrannical in some
circumstances (overthrow of Ita-
Ilian government-leading to Fas-
cism) are not considered tyran-
nical in other circumstances
(overthrow of British govern-
ment leading to American demo-

icracy). Minorities initiated both

movements. This analogy dem-
onstrates that because an act is
illegal and is do-ne by a minor-
ity, it does not necessarily fol-
low that ‘one -should refrain
from commuting it, regardless
of whether the minority is
“right or wrong in its views” as
Prof. Lee suggests. A group

' must look to the environment

that provo-kes the civil disobedi-
ence.’ Thus, depending on the
environment, an act can be legal
an-d unjust or illegal and just. I
feel the civil disobedience of to-
day must be placed in this lat-
ter category.

Let us look to our history to
see why civil disobedience might
be just, although illegal. Dur-
ing World War II many Ameri-
can  of Japanese des-
cent were forcibly removed
from their homes on the West
Coast and sent to “camps.”
Should not Americans directly
resist such actions? Is it tyran-
ny if they block the trucks that
carry other Americans away,
depriving them of their consti-
tutiona'1 rights, or resort to
other acts of civil disobedience?
I think not. The acts of minor-
ities pursuing these courses of
action would not be considered
trannical in light of the tyran-

besl shapes in Pgh.

‘Pitt News’ Review

p‘Bonnie and Clyde’ Rollicking

by PAUL ANDERSON

Successfully _tackling a
movie within the short space
of fifty lines demands an
unrelenting constancy to the
serious moral implications
of the film. Acknowledging
the spohi-stication of the reader
and my dedication to the intel-‘
le-ctual comm-un.i.ty, I will now
move fOlI'W3.'I‘d to answer, in
depth, the most pressing ques-
tion asked by anyone interested
in viewin.g Bonnie and Clyde.
The question-., of co-urse, is “Just
how much skin do we get to
see?” and the answer is “Plen-
ty, if you 'pay «strict alttterrti-on to
detail.”

Bonnie and Clyde is a rollick-
ing fr-olicsome excursion back
into the early thirties and ‘a
time when a person cou-ld be-
come a “celebrity by ﬂouitinig the
law (as opposed to today, of
co-urse). Wariren Beatty, hand-
some devil that he” is, plays
Clyde Barrow, a share-cnopiper
turned bank robber, and Faye

',_Donaway, «plays Bonnie, an ex-

waitress now his gun moll.
Together they team up with
Blanch and Buck (Clydels broth-
er and his wife, a ministeir’s
daughter) and C. W. Moss (Mich-
ael Pollard), a former ‘garage
attendant, to form the beguiling
[Bar-row Ga.n-g. A11 experts in dis-
organized crime, they ravage
and amuse the countryside by
robbing banks with a style so
folksy that ‘they might well be
making a withdrawal. 4"

Their robberies are spectacu-
lar simply because they get
away with them. A typical Bar-
row Gang job would go some-
thing like this: Guns drawn,
Bonnie, Clyde, and Buck storm
into a sleepy mid-western bank,
introduce themselves as the fa-
mous Barrow Gang and proudly
announce that this is a stick-up
only to be ignored by everyone
inside.

When they ﬁn-ally get their
satchels ﬁlled with loot, the
gang rushes out into the s-treet
to ﬁnd that C. W. Moses has
parked the car to attract the at-
'tention of a female stroller, By
now the alarm has been sound-
ed an-d the Whole town is in a

state of riotous confusio-n.

The gang them has to push and
elbow its way «through the ex-
cited townsfolk to reach the get-
away car. A Keystone Cops
chlase over hill and dale follows
with everyone leaniing out of
the car windows, guns blazing
away, harmlessly knocking out
lights and shatter-ing windows.

But the Barrow Gang kills
people and towards the end of
the film the whole country is on
the lookout for the “will-of-the
wisp bandiit and his blonde com-
panion.” This transition creates
a. change of mood that can be
especially irritating to the view-
er.

After we watch Buck caught
in a circle of -lawmen with half
his ﬁace shot off, see him spin
around, blood pouring from his
nose, ﬁnally falling into B. quiv-

ering bloody heap ait the feet of
the posse, nothing’s really fun-
ny anymore. But the jokes go
on, right up to the machine gun
anniihiliation of Bonnie and Clyde
by ﬁve hidden Texas Rangers.
All in all Bonnie and Clyde
makes a good weekend date.
And if you really like your cops

and robbers stuff with the ac-

cent on robbers and are not
very serious about college, it
makes a good movie to ‘blow a

The reception is open to the
cadets, their families, and vis-

All University women are in-

of the reception lies in the num-
ber of University women who
attend.

“Nothing would be Wlorse,” she

Bic Medium Polntlsc S,

stated, “than to have 700 or 800
cadets and only 100 women.”

by TIIVI GRGURICH
As Told to Mike Brourman

(Many people have blamed coach Bob Timmons for the basket-
ball situation at Pitt. But Tim Grgurich, former player and now
freshman coach, sees a different villain. What the basketball pro-
gram needs, says Grgurich is support, a commodity that has never
existed here. In this, the first in a series of articles, Grgurich ex-
plains what “never was.”)


.\\\\L‘§<‘$ii\\\TZ“-‘.?\\\\\\\\

What “never was” can be broken down into three major
categories. 1) School Spirit and Student Support, 2) The
Support of the Faculty and Administration, and 3) Strong-
er Support of the Athletic Department. I would like to dis-
cuss, in tu=rn, each -of these problems and then give what I
believe are possible solutions to them. ~

> School Spirit and Stu-dent Support: What is the argu-
ment that students use in explaining the small crowds at
the basketball games? They say the only reason we don’t
have big crowds is because the team is losing.

BUT WHAT ABOUT the 1962363 and ’63-’64 teams.
Their combined record was 37-10 and both went to post-
season t-ourneys, the first to the NCAA and the latter to
the NIT. Where were the crowds then?

If it hadn’t been for more people in the ‘city going, the
crowds would have been no larger than they are now. There
never was any school spirit or student support then, just
as there isn't today.

If you don’t believe me, then here are a couple of inci-
dents that should awaken you. The day we left for the
NCAA Tournament, stuldents kept asking us where we were
‘ going. No one came up and
wished us goo-d luck. In fact,
there was one sign in the
whole Student Union wish-
ing us luck.

THE NEXT YEAR we
were ending our season at
home against Temple. We
had already accepted an NIT

for the NCAA. Seven sen-
iors were graduating from
the team; seniors who had
made their school a nation-

people at the game. This is
a disgrace to the student
body and the school. These
seven players had made Pitt
prominent again, and yet
the students couldn’t turn
out and give them a final
something that they could
always_ remember. THIS IS
WHAT NEVER WAS.
>The Faculty and Adminis-
tration: The Administration
has never given complete
support to basketball. It has
always been given a back-

Hopes to See Some Spirit seat to football, even though
in the past decade the basketball teams have gone to more
tournaments than the football team has bowl games. Form-
er Chancellor Litchfield attended every football game, but
I think he went to one basketball game in the ’62-'64 era.

>The Athletic Department sometimes has not shown
strong enough support for basketball. Looking at what Mr.
Timmons had to work with during the past ten years, it is
a miracle that ‘he has managed to produce four tournament
teams.

TIM GRGURICII

FOR A LONG TIME he coached not only basketball,
but was an assistant football coach as well. His assistant
Dr. Carl Peterson, had to coach freshman basketball, assist
with the varsity. head the Men’s Required Physical Educa-
tion Department, teach in the department fulltime, and
recruit.

I ‘would like to see anyone run a big league program and
compete with the top schools in the country under that kind
of a svstem. But they did a pretty good job of it despite
everything.

For the record, most major colleges have, besides a
fullltime (no football) head coach, an assistant coach, a
freshman. coach, and three recruiters. None have any teach-
ing duties.

Most major schools take movies not only of all of their
games, but of scrimmages and practices as well. Until this
year we were able to take an average of four films per year.

These are only a few of the points which I am. trying
to bring to your attention. Basketball _has had many prob-
lems that students probably never realized or even thought

to ask about. I am’ hoping '90 not 0111)’ enlighten Y0U.‘b11l3 ‘$0 ,

The end of the road is
just around the next bend.
Although there’s a lot of
acti-on and hitting left in the
remaining 120 minutes of foot-
ball, most of the Panther sen-
riors can see the end of their
four-year career fast approach-
ing.

For some, there may be pro-
fessional football in the future.
For others, there are other
sports or other campus activ-
ity to fall back on. For most,
however, football is their whole
existence at the University; and
when its gone, part of their life
:is -gone, too.

Ray Radakovich, for instance,
has put in three hard years of
varsity work. Two weeks ago,
he suffered a knee injury which
almost ended his career. But h-e
responded quickly to treatment,
and he’s back. And he’s glad to
be back.

Notre Dame
Hurt Cats
Physically

Losing its seventh game
to Notre Dame was literally
a physical beating for the Pan-
thers.

From 12 to 14 players are bad-
ly bruised. And with Army only
.‘th'I"€€ days away, the Oats’ win:
nling chances appear 

'Iihe injured list includes ﬁve
defensive backs. “We haven't
worked with our secondary yet,
this week,” Dave Hart report-
ed. “'I7hey’re badly beaten phy-
sicaillly.”

Defensive back Mickey Depp,
with ,a pulled calf muscle, may
miss the .Army game. Joe Cur-
tin, Dave Dibbley, Paul Killian,
and Mike Elliot are badly bruis-
ed.

“They were out for days, but
now some of them may be out
the week,” Hart said. “I don't
know yet.”

Linebackers Eugene Yuajko
and Lou Parrott; tackles Ed
Whittaker and Dave Drake; and
end Terry Hoover are other 
ling members of the defensive
team. I

Offensive tackle Greg Ellis,
who “played his best game Sat-
urday,” Hart said, is out with
a -sprained knee.“ He may be
out for -the year,” said the Pan-
ther coach.

“Ch-uck Win-ters, who did (pret-
ty good for the ﬁrst time at
quarterback, hurt his knee. It's
questionable whether he’ll be
able to go against A-rmy,” Hart
po=in:t—ed out.

“Right now our biggest prob-
lem will be brringing the play-
ers back p-hysically, aftelr the
terrible physical beating by
Notre Dame,” he said.

The return of quarterbacks
Bob Bazylak and Frank Gus-
tine and guard Ray Radakovich
may relieve Hart somewhat, but
the other injuries remain.

The defense which has 'bat-
tled consistently, despite strug-
gling through twothirds of -al-
most every game, may be in for
a letdown. Every team that
plays Notre Dame, except Pur-
due ‘this year, usualllly collapses
-the following week.

“I'm convinced Notre Dame is
«a great football team,” H-art
said Sunday after the ‘game.
“They have all the ingredients.”

End of Football Road Faces

Seniors Radakovich, Hoover

 

RAY RADAKOVICH
Scramble Blocking

“I felt terrible,” remembered
Ray. “I felt worst of all about
missing Penn State. I’ve been
looking forward to it because
my brother plays up and there
and my cousin coaches. That
game, and Notre Dame, meant
a lot.” Ray was sorry he missed
the Irish, but he isn’t about to
miss anything the rest of the
season.

“When you're «a senior, some-
-times you think the end of the
season would be «a relief,” Ray
offered. “But not being able to
play was worse. When I came
up to watch practice, and in the
stands Watching the game I felt
out of place. It’-s like cutting off
your nose.”

-At the close of the season,
Rad-akovich will direct his ef-
forts towards getting into law
school. After- football, it's all
he’s got left since he himself
rules out the pros (“My blinding
-speed and 30 inch waist makes
it almost -an impossibility”).

On the other hand, Terry
Hoover zips rights into wrest-
ling season a week -after foot-
ball season ends. Wrestling
should diverthis attention from
pinning over the close of his
football career, but surprisingly
Terry's reaction was almost
idential to that of Radakovich.

“I’ll really rnisjs football,” pre-
dicted Hoover. “I went out for
it last year because I missed it
from high »school, and I'll miss it
during wrestling season.

“We lost a couple games we
should have won, and I'll re-
member that for the rest of my
life,” he continued. “I just wish
we had another year to do bet-
ter.” Radsakovi-ch voiced the

TERRY noovmn

same regrets.

“Like any other senior, I’m
sorry we couldn’t make a win-
ner here before we left and help»
ed out coach Hart,” said Ray.
“If you had to do it all over

again, you realize how much ”

more you can put out because
we've come so close so often.”

In another two weeks, the
1967 season is history, and Hoov-
er and Radakovich will go their
separate ways. Terry have
a lot to do-—worry about mak-
ing rweighrt, adjust to a differ-
ent kind of athletic contest. Ray
will have a lot more time to
h.-imIself——«time to plan the fu-
ture, time to relieve the past.

The end of the road is just
around the next bend, but be-
fore then both Hoover and Rad-
akovich would like to go out a
winner.

Morale Still High

Frosh Prep for Irish

The freshman football
team holds its last two prac-
-tices, today and tomorrow, be-
fore facing the freshmen of
Notre Dame Friday -night at
Forbes Field. Although the Cubs
lost their second straight game
last Friday against Ohio State,
the team morale is still high.

“They're a spirited bunch of
kids," commented coach Darrell
Lewis about his team. “I hope
that it's this good Friday night.”

The Irish frosih are expected
to be the toughest foe on the
Cubs’ schedule. They are big-
gers than the freshman teams
of Penn State and Ohio State.
They are even bigger than coach
Dave H-art's varsity.

The probable starting defen-
sive line for coach Wally
Moore’s freslunan team will con.
slst of Tony Capers (6-2, 240),
Mike Martin (6-3, 230), Larry
DiNa.1-do (6-2, 228), and Tony
Falsotta (6-2, 260). '

“I expect Notre Dianne to be ,

nether  >7 .  smeﬁ’.

  
   

ed Lewis. “They're so big. And
the freshman schedule was made
up so that each team we face
is better than the team before.”

In singling out a few boys
who have looked -sharp in prac-
tice, Moore also mentioned Irish
center Srteve Buches; ends Bob
Neidhert and Craig Stark; line-
backer John McI-Iale; quarter-
backs Joe Thei-smann and Chuck
Ziloch ; and  Ernie Jack-

son and Jim Sheahan. But the? V I

Irish fros-h ‘hasn't played any
games yet, so their real test
won't be until Friday night.

As for the Cubs, they should
be better than last week's dis-
appointing performlance. Lewis
is hoping that the defense will
improve. And fullback Tony Es-
-posito is expected to return to
the lineup and bolster the of-
fensive attack.

"If the defensive ends can do
their jobs,” explained Lewis,
“we have a chance to beaItNothre

News Hawks of practice? Plen

P cty, according to -their cagey men-

“Basically, we have topractice
sportsmanship for when after
the game's over,” he announced.
“We have to practice our vic-
tory cheer and our ‘good lspolrt'

Rosenstein denied that the
“I-llawlks” were trying to run UP
the score last week against
W.PG’H. “Thlalt’s a lie.” he S1’-3-1:-
ed. “Wlhy, if it was true. I would
have run more end sweeps.”

There are scouts who have
compared “Flatbush’s” SWOOPS
to those of 0. J. Simpson —
when 0. J. was still on his
crutches.

by MIKE BROURMAN

Once again the rat-tat-tat
of ball meeting hardwood
echoes through the dusty
conﬁnes of the Field House. It's
lpiractice now, but in just two
weeks it'll be tor real.

On Dec. 1, coach Bob Tim-
mons and the basketball team
open «against Rutgers. The past
three seasons have been tough
ones for the cagers, but Tim-
mons sees a vast improvement

' this time around.

“I’m o=pti.mistic,” he said. “It’s
been a good squad to work with
even this far. They "have good
attitude. But, the big thing is
that we have eight or nine boys
who can play without hurting
our club.”

Timmons credits this increas-
ed depth for some of the hustle
and desire shown in practice.

“There has been great com-
petlilti-on for positions this yelarr,”
he noted. “This is something
that we haven't had in the past.
I think it has a great deal to
do with the increased hustle.
They have to put out to keep
their jo .” A

With more depth, Timmons
also intends to play a somewhat
different brand of basketball
“We're going to play a faster
ball game with more pressure
defense,” he revealed.

" This will mean a switch from
the zone, the primary defense
last year, to a man-to-man. “Last
year we had to use the zone,”
Timmons noted, “because with
only ﬁve ballplayens we couldn’t
be quite as aggresive as I
would have liked. We didn't
want to _get into foul trouble.

Also, I don't think we were as
good defensively.” ,-

Timmons confessed his prefer-
ence for the man-to-man. “With
it, you can account for all ﬁve
men. You know who's not doing
the job, and who's doing a good
job. There's individual respon-
sibility. Also, you can match up
abil-ities better; ‘pit speed against
speed and size against size.”

One thing that would make
many coalches pes'srim.istic is the
fact that of Timmons’ nine
“starters,” four are sophomores.
But he refuses to share in this
view.

“We’re going with the sopho-
mores because they’re our best
ballplayers. They have the hus-
tle and they want to play. Still,
I think we’re pretty well-balanced
with three juniors and two sen-
iors also. The sophomores will
make a few mistakes, but they’ll
make up for it with their hustle.
They I are a very aggressive
group.”

The “aggrelssors” include Bob
Petrini, who will probably start
-in theibackcourt with senior Pete
Smith, Charlie Hunt, who will
be the center, and Rob McFar-
land and Mike Plaltvcher, who will

share the forward with senior

"Backing them up will be a
trio of juniors, Steve Steven-
son, Len Klalata, and Tony De-
Lisio.

These cagers will face a 22
game schedule that their coach
admits is not as tough as in
past years. “We’ve been trying
to ease up on it,” he explains.
“It’s not as hard to do in bas-
ketball as in football, since we
only work a year or two ahead.
We try not to overschedule our
material.”

For the the ﬁnst time in a
long time, the team is not sched-
uled for a Christmas tourna-

.ment. “We used to play in the

bigger ones,” he noted. “But, in
the past few years we’ve gone
to the smaller ones. This year
we lost out when the Mobile
Class-ic wouldn't pay us enough
to make it worthwhile.”

Why the smaller tourneys?
“Well,” Timmons explained,
“there is no use going unless
you think you have a chance to
win. Otherwise, it’s no fun.

Next year, the cagers are
scheduled for the Hurricane
Classic, a stronger ﬁeld. And
the year after? “We’re trying
for either the Gator Bowl Tour-
ney or the Holiday Festival,”
Timmons said.

lance if they wanted to subject
themselves to the procedure,
but that it shouldn’t be a re-
quirement, especially in a uni-
versity. ‘‘There’s something
wrong,” he stressed, “when col-
leagues must discuss their work
in -secret seminars.”

Last year’s report of the Ed-
ucational Policies Committee on
the problem of secret research
stated that “secret research is
inconsistent with the purpose of
a university: free inquiry and
the creation and dissemination
of new knowledge.”

The report also points out
that “knowledge is advanced
quickly by such programs even
though dissemination is delay-
ed. Hot-war research has his-
torically lbeen productive "tech-
nollogically.”

The Educational Policies Com-
mittee therefore recommends:

> That the individual faculty

’ member be permitted, on leave

status or on a part-time basis
within the usual rules affecting
part-time outside commitments
by the faculty, to engage in se-
cret research under non-univer-
sity auspices.

> That the university investi-

gate the feasibility and proprie ‘

ty off-campus facilities to con-
duct research not suitable for
U-fl-iVelI‘S'lty sponsorship. This can
be done in coopenaltion with
other institutions, academic or
non-academic.

*> That existing commitments
be reviewed in the light of these
recoamnn-en.dat_ion's looking to: se-
curing declassiﬁcation of the
program, transfering sponsor-
ship to an organization of the
kind described in recommenda-
-tion three, or terminate the pro-
gram.

Universities Protest Secret Research 

Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON——The opposi-
tion to secret research on uni-
versity campuses is at least
partly responsible for -a recent
Defense Department move to-
ward “decl1assvifying” some proj-
ects now underway at universi-
ties.

A Pentagon spokesmen said

the “hue and cry” raised by
some students and faculty mem-
bers against classified research
is one of the reasons that the
move is underway.

Relatively few projects are
likely to be declassiﬁed, since
the survey to -determine what
projects can be given a nonse-

cret status is aimed only at
classiﬁed projects in the area of
basic research.

Of the more than 4,000 proj-
ects that fall under the heading
of basic, as opposed to applied,
research, only 138 are presently
classiﬁed. A far greater percen-
tage of the applied research
projects are secret.

The ﬁnst suggestion that the
Defense Department was trying
to cut down the number of
classiﬁed research projects came
from Dr. John Foster, director
of Defense Research and Engi-
neering. Foster’s office exercises
broad control over the depart-
ment’s entire $7.2 billion re-

search and engineering pro-
gram.

The amount of this total spent
on university projects is rela--
tively zsmalll — somewhere be-
tween $400 and $600 million. 012'
this amount, some $140 million
goes into basic research proj-
ects.

One Pentagon source suggest-
ed that it would be difficult to
pin down exactly how much
money goes to universities as
such, because of the difficulty of
deﬁning what constitutes a. uni-
versity. This spokesman cited
the Massachusetts Institute of’
Technology as an example of an
institution that receives such a.

large proportion of its funds
from the federal government
that there is some question
whether or not it should be con-
sidered a university.

The Defense Department's ap-
parent goal in regard to basic
research is to dedlassify all proj-
ects that fall under that head-
ing. Any project that cannot be
declassiﬁed will probably be re-
moved from the category of
‘basic research.

Some of the projects that now _

are classiﬁed do not actually in-
volve work that must be kept
secret.
