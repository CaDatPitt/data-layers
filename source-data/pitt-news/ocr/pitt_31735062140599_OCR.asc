chemistry should enable processors of fats to do a
better job in preparing them for edible use,” Dr.

Newton explained.

The University has been awarded the ﬁrst

of ﬁve fellowships in nutrition offered to uni- ’
Versities and medical schools by Swift and
Company. Dr. Charles G. King, professor of
chemistry, and Dr. H. E. Longenecker, Buhl
foundation research fellow and assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry, will conduct the re-
search, a fundamental study of fats and oils.

The study is expected to shed light on the complex
structure of fats and oils, and lead to discoveries on
the value of fats in the diet, according to Dr. H. C.
Newton, vice-president in charge of research at Swift

and company who announced the award.

Award of the fellowship was announced Monday
by Dr. Newton, and accepted on behalf of the Uni-
versity by Chancellor John G. Bowman.

Dr. King, famous as the discoverer of the chemical
identity of vitamin C, has conducted several investi-
gations in nutrition, and written research reports on
synthetic fats, enzymes, general nutrition and vita-
mins. In 1939 he received the Pennsylvania Public
Health association award.

Dr. Longenecker held a National Research coun-

cil post-doctorate research fellowship for two years

after receiving his PhD degree from Penn State. In

Fraternity Council

Chancellor John G. Bowman last
Friday night declared that man-
kind is “at the beginning of a new
day in education.”

Speaking before more than
3,000 assembled guests at the din-
ner of the National lnterfraternity
conference, largest ever held in
New York, ,Dr. Bowman emphasiz-
ed his belief that the “new day"
would not be one characterized so
much for new construction or for
larger numbers, but “one rather
for learning how to live into our
heritage.”

He declared that he saw in the
meeting of the fraternities and
sororities of the nation something
of a symbol which he termed a
sign in American education

“I believe that this meeting (of
fraternities) is as great a sign as

has yet appeared in American edu-

cation that we are to seek and to
get powerful inspiration and cre-
ative living in our colleges,” he
said.

He termed colleges and frater-
nities the homes of men and wom-
en who are ﬁnding the joy of life
for themselves and are rising to a
position where they are becoming
the glory of the earth, and he
termed fraternities or their coun-
terparts the instrument by_ which
the intention of seeking creative
living will be seized and carried to
its top expression.

The Chancellor criticized ugli-
ness in atmosphere and surround-
ings in college life, terming it but
a reﬂection of minds that are empty
and dry, and said that ugliness
makes for the kind of atmosphere

“in which a professor lectures from
the same notes for 10 years.”

“In such an atmosphere I won-
der if we are not fooling students
rather than helping them toward
the gladness and glory of their
lives. Ugliness is just plain poison
in education,” he said.

.Amos Memorial
Fund Extended

With contributions to the Dean
Amos Memorial fund drive coming
“slowly but steadily,” Jean
Brink, C42, chairman, announced
last week that the campaign would
be “indeﬁnitely extended’ until
every undergraduate woman had
been solicited.

Approximately 2000 l e t t e r s

,_ women to contact each woman stu-
dent individually.

According to the latest tabula-

sophomore, junior and senior class-

Concurrent with the announce-
ment extending the Student-facul-
ty association book drive to Fri-
day, Lois Galbreath, C42, co-chair-
man of the campaign, stated today
that the receiving center of the
campaign has been moved from the
alcove near the book store to a
booth in the ground ﬂoor elevator
lobby. .

Miss Galbreath believed that the
new location will be more conven-
ient for both students and faculty
than the previous center in the al-
COVC.

“We also hope that it will act as
a reminder to everyone who passes
it during the day, for we expect at
least double the number of books
received by the end of the week,”
she continued.

In addition to the receiving
point on the ground floor, the Uni-
versity book store has indicated
that it will also accept contribu-
tions anytime during the store
hours of 8:30 o’clock in the morn-
ing to 8 o’clock in the evening.

“Books are signed, sealed, and
ready to be delivered to the Ameri-
can Library association for distri-
bution to the army camps. Within
the next month, the national drive,
sponsored by the association in
conjunction with the Red Cross
and USO, will begin and we still

of the book ﬁrst appeared in that

Twenty years ago H. L. Mencken
was the intellectual god in absentia
of the American college campi; and
by substitution the vampire (col-
loq.) of the ‘faculty-club. The roar-
ing-twenties‘ was to him one big
merry-go-round (which it was),
and he got rich and famous writing
about it.

But this book tells about his be-
ginning, as areporter in his native
Baltimore forty years ago, when he
was 18 years old. When Mencken
was 22 he worked 65 hours at a
stretch covering the great Balti-
imore ﬁre of 1904 for the Morning
Herald. Later he became editor of
that paper,» and when it died of
ﬁnancial anemia transferred to the
famous “Sunpa'pers,” of which he
is today a non-working director.

But this book is limited to Menck-
en’s life from age 18-25, the days
of “the good living which once
made ‘Baltimore the envy of every
other American city save New 01'-
leans.” His anecdotes are about
“the gaudy life the young news-
paper reporters led in the major
American cities at the turn of the
century,” which was nothing like
the contemporary newspaper “ho-
monculus at the end of a telephone
wire,” whose observations are writ-
ten down by some “literary cas-
trati who never leave the office.”

On the whole Mencken overdoes
himself. Contrast the working re-

Dr. A. P. James Proposes

By ROBERT COOK

In a letter to the editor of the
New York Times published Novem-
ber 30, Dr. Alfred P. James, pro-

fessor of history, suggested a com-
monwealth of nations for interna-
tional organization after the pres-
ent crisis. '

_ Dr. James states that the world
is in a mess and that the clearest
way out is a better world organ-
ization for the better functioning
of human society everywhere. The
people who do not like the ar-
rangement suggested by Hitler
should begin to design a scheme
of their own.

As to Clarence K. Streit’s pro-
posal in 1938 of a union similar to
that of the original 13 col-
onies, Dr. James asserts, “Inevit-

. ably such a union involves the sur-
render or transfer of some half.

dozen or more si niﬁcant owers
g Q

and functions to the “union” of the

world’-s leading democracies.”

Unlike Mr. Streit, Walter Lipp- '

man, offered a plan in The Atlan-
._tic Monthly for August, 1926, that
did not‘ limit union to the demo-
cratic countries. Mr. Lippman
wanted a world executive, a world
legislature, a world judiciary, and
a world police force involving an
army and navy and a powerful air
force.

R. H. Tawney, an English pub-
licist, combining features of the
above proposals, suggests the
transfer of sovereign powers: cur-
rency, trade, diplomacy, and war-
fare. ‘

Concerning these, Dr. James re-
marked, “The trouble with all
such proposals is that they are too
bitter medicine for the present. . .
Some way out will be found,
though it may be only after ter-
rible human suffering andloss.”

The United States, Dr. James
maintains, should be the nation to
offer the plan of a commonwealth

     

      
 

Commonwealth of Nations

historically it is a strong word.”

The merits of such a world
commonwealth Dr,
James goes on to explain. It would

be an easy matter to initiate and

are many,

it would not involve the surren-

der at once of traditional and cher-

YMHA on Belleﬁeld has

 

 

‘ocratic nations

of nations. “ ‘Commonwealth’ is an

ished national sovereign powers. It
would have good neighborliness as
its foundation. It would be capable
of growth and possible of world-
wide acceptance.

All of. the British possessions
and dominions, all of the Latin

I American nations, the exiled gov-

ernments of Luxembourg, Holland,
Belgium, Norway, Czecho-Slo-
vakia; China, Russia, Sweden, Den-
mark, Switzerland; and in the not
too distant future France, Spain,
Egypt, India, Portugal, and Tur-
key,“ and possibly Eire, Italy, and
Germany ‘Would accept membership
in the commonwealth. L '

As a nation, the US should take .‘
the lead,*advocate-s Dr. James, but
leadership in the future should
shift from one nation or capital to
the other. This scheme is positive,
not negative like the admirable 
futile scheme for the outlawry of
war. .

_ “A world commonwealth of dem-
would promote
peaceful cooperation, possibly
along all lines, while promising its
members mutual defense and pro-
tection against lawlessness and ag-
gression.

“It's immediate initiation and
early establishment, with the door
left wide,open for future adjust-
ments, would add greatly to the
1101383 DIN‘ expectations of mankind
fora better world in the future,”
concluded Dr. James.

demurely graces page 90 of this
month’s Harper's Bazaar.

Miss Lee, as the editors respect-
fully call her, is pictured threading
her needle so that she rnay finish
the piece of needlepoint which
covers her legs~all the way down
to her shapely ankles. Gypsy, as
she is fondly remembered by a lu-
crative if slightly baldish group of
admirers, will be recalled as the
obscure strip-teaser who stepped
out of the chorus a few years back
to make burlesque audiences" sit up
and take notice.

It’s a far cry from the days when
the tall girl with the inviting per-
sonality decorated the stages of
second-rate theatres throughout
the country, tenaciously holding to
her contention that disrobing is an
art, ﬁnally reaching a point where
her ideas were given consideration
in one of the country’s better lit-
erary magazines——The New York-
er.

Her sensational rise in the enter-
tainment world has been climaxed
by the success of her recent book
-—-“The G-String Murder Mys-
tery." Thirty thousand copies have
been sold so far.

“Christmas on the Keith Family
Circuit” is the title of the Bazaar

story and the style in which it is
written is the kind that invites skip-
ping a paragraph here and there,
trying to get the meat out of the
narrative, and then ﬁnding there
isn’t any meat to get.

Somehow we can’t orient our-
selves to Gypsy’s new position in
the realm of letters. Her simple ap-
proach to the story of her life (the
article is more or less autobio-
graphical), entirely devoid of the
risque, just doesn’t hold together,
any more than did her costumes in
livelier days.

She was at one time a colorful
ﬁgure, to put it mildly. Now she’s
only another book-of-the-monther.

The Christmas spirit is already
making itself felt in the depart-
ment stores. And the most reliable
sign is in the toy department of
one of the bigger establishments.

A little boy, pretty much ex-
hausted at ﬁve o’clock in the after-
noon, after spending the ,greater
part of the day riding hobby-hors-
es, viewing Krazy Kat movies, and
making faces at Dumbo, was head-
ing for the escalators-—going down
——When his mother pulled him back.

“Where do you think you're go-
ing?” she barked. “Don't you

Speaking of War Games,
Who Goes to What Bowl?

BY FRANK MASTORAKI

Although the Pitt football team defeated the Carnegie squad, there

  

was nothing spectacular about Pitt's playing. It was generally presup-
posed that Pitt would be able to crush an inferior Tech team. Further-
more, numerous penalties inﬂicted on both sides made the game dull
and uninteresting.

The Fordham game is another
story.

deep into enemy territory.

After the victory, and with an
undefeated season to their credit,
the beer and pretzel boys with
their Finnish mascots, could try
once again to defeat an organiza-
tion which tied them last Septem-
ber after a smashing battle in
which both sides concentrated on
aerial offenses and defenses.

That the red and green boys
would walk over the lion from
Ethiopia was anticipated by! the
spectators, but that this lion would
lick a “highly favored" organiza-
tion came as a complete surprise——
especially to Mussolini.

Now all the eyes are focused on
the coming New Year battles. Who
is going to what “bowl” is gener-
ally known.

Hitler would much rather send
his dream team in the ﬁeld against
Churchill's boys than ‘Roosevelt’s
because the US lettermen are
fresher and considered a more se-
rious threat.

There is some doubt whether or
not the army boys, now practicing
in the South, will be shipped off to
battle at the “Yellow Bowl."

Experts emphasize that the
United States navy with the aid of
the army could deﬁnitely defeat
the Japs. Rooters are cautioned
that it would take two years.

With the United States army and
navy slated for the East, Coach
Adolf would be in the much desir-
ed position to concentrate all his
efforts in crossing the Moscow line

the Yellow Bowl, I would not be
surprised to learn that Coach
Adolf is not only pressing Japan
headlong into battle, but that Nazi

to victory—over Japan.

‘7/to /Zecolul 

By Norman Marcus and Herb Reingold

The ﬁrst of the month has rolled
around again and we present our
regular resume of outstanding rec-
ords of a few years back . . .

We have always considered Lar-
ry Clinton as one of the most un-
derrated bands in the country.
Bands like Claude Thornhill and
others, who are employing unison
pclarinets in the styling of their mu-
sic, are reviving the style used by
Clinton a few years ago.

This can be evidenced in Larry’s
arrangements of “Twilight Inter-
llude,” “Studies in Blue, Red, Scar-
let, and Surrealism.” (The latter
are four different records.)

For those of you who want to
get the best recording of “Star-
dust,” the Hoagy Carmichael mas-
terpiece, the following arrange-
ments are recommended in the or-
der named: Paul Whiteman’s con-,
cert arrangement, Alec Temple-
ton’s ultra-pianoing, Artie Shaw's
dance version, Glenn Miller’s in-
strumental, and Glen Gray's press-
ing with the Kenny Sargent vocal.

The band of the late Hal Kemp
can be found at their best in the
Dana Suesse composition “Blue
Mooniight” and the immortal
“Got a Date With an Angel.”

Benny Goodman at his peak in
out-of-this world solos on “My
Melancholy Baby,” “Opus 5,”
“Bumble-Bee Stomp" and other
swing classics too numerous to

mention.

Theme songs that should be in-
cluded in your collection are Tom-
my Reynolds’ “Pipe Dreams,”
Thornhil1’s “‘Snowfall,” Tommy

State university, and his fraternity

calling the goldﬁsh swallowing
craze one night last week. Ferraro
declared that anyone who would
swallow a goldﬁsh was “balmy."

“For $5 I would swallow a gold-
ﬁsh and be balmy,’ Petrilli said.
“I’ll bet there’s nothing to it.”

’When $2.50 was offered, Petrilli

’ seized a gold ﬁsh, opened his mouth
. and gulped.
“Hmm. ‘Not bad at all,’ he said,
reaching for another one.
He grabbed the second goldﬁsh,

 lowed. It didn’t go down. Petrilli

of hair for college women Friday

Bruck in presenting the guiding
principle of her work.

Miss Bruck will select several
students as representative of types
requiring different hair styles, and
with the aid of her assistant she
will show how the hair can be made
to suit different faces and ﬁgures.

General standardization of Am-

Bernard Cohen, C42, is the first
Pitt student to be accepted by the.
navy into the new University of
Pittsburgh naval ﬂying cadet ‘unit
from the 23 Pitt men who have ap-
plied.

Having registered two weeks ago
when Ensign Ralph Cox visited the
University, Cohen was accepted
when he passed his physical test
given Monday in the Old‘Federal

building by the Naval Aviation Ca-
det Selection board.

Today is the last day . for all
students who appliedfor the ﬂying
unit to be examined. Students who
have applied still may be examined
by the boardfor entrance into the
unit.

To qualify, applicants must have
two years of college credits, be
unmarried, and in good physical
health. Students may take the phy
sical examination, enlist at a later
date and complete their present se-
mester or college year before be-
ing called to active duty.

Airlines, KDKA
To Cooperate
\X/ith Pitt Players

Pitt Players will present “Flight
to the West” next Wednesday and
Friday at Foster memorial with
the assistance of the Pan American
airlines and radio station KDKA.

The setting for the drama, the
interior of a trans-atlantic clipper,
was adapted from a photograph
sent by the Airlines, and the sound
of an airplane starting, flying and
idling, will be reproduced from a
KDKA record made of an actual
airplane ﬂight. ' g

A’ 16-inch transcription, bor-
rowed fromthe radio station, will

be used to project the sounds over
two amplifying systems and six
sets of speakers.

The stage set, complete with cab-
ins, indirect»-lighting and curved
furniture, follows the photograph.
The setting will appear as though
one side of the clipper had been
cut away and a section of the in-
terior walls will also be cut away,
to show simultaneous action in
each of the three cabins.

Windows will appear to be
splashed with spray as the plane
takes off.

The entire set will be four feet
from the floor of the stage and the
door by which passengers enter
will be seven feet from the floor.
Characters will appear to enter
from a poontoon and descend a
few steps into the cabins.

Realistic lighting will be used
throughout the play, yellow light
to represent day and blue illumi-
nation, night. _

_ By unanimous vote at a meeting

Ralph Wilde, C44, president, ex-

should be placed on scholarship.

He said that freshmen who are so
outstanding in activities that they
are considered for Druids should-
be able to maintain such an aver-

Mine Strike Causes
Business Index Drop

Stoppage of coal production in
many mines in this district again
was the main explanation of de-
pressed business activity last week,
according to the University Bureau
of Business Research. Steel output
dropped slightly but continues at
near capacity, as a result.

The Bureau’\s seasonally adjust-
ed index of business activity last
week dropped to the lowest level
since April, although the index was
about the same level prevailing at
this time last year.

Trade. activity remained at high
levels, the index rising about two
per cent. About the same relative
improvement over last year is
shown by the latest one-week and
four-week comparisons, the Bureau
reported. 9 '

Duquesne.

E News All-City Team

Comes the end of football sea-
son, and just about everybody ‘and

efhis uncle burns some midnight oil

in an attempt to pick an all-

2 American squad. Not to be out-

done, civic minded members of the
‘Pitt News sports staff gathered for
a bit of verbal ayeing and naying.
Result: Another in the
series of All-City grid teams.

And once again, Duquesne Uni-
versity’s undefeated footballers re-
! ﬂeet obvious superiority by plac-
ing eleven men on_ this-mythical
two-team masterpiece. The Pan-
thers earn nine spots, while the
eager but meager Techmen garner
only three nominations. And
though P.C.W. and Mount Mercy
. have reserved “soft-spots” in the
»hearts of all PN sportswriters,
y the two schools failed to get a
mention on either of the super
squads.

Hardest positions to ﬁll seemed
to be the guard’ and tackle slots,
due mostly to the lack of guard
and tackle talent. Easiest and yet
most difficult choices to make were
those for the backﬁeld, because of
a surplus of outstanding men in
that department.

At the ends are Johnny Rokisky
and Stan Gervelis. This years
nomination makes the super Duke
ﬂankerman a two-time winner on
the. Pitt News all-city selection
sheet. And those who have seen the
Panthers perform this season,
would hesitate long, before offer-
ing anyobjection to Gervelis, right
to a -first team berth. Joe Squires
of Duquesne and “Andy” Ander-
son of Tech win second team nom-
inations for the end position.

Jack Durishan and Al DeLucia
take care of the tackle duties, and
capably too. Delucia, like Rokisky,
won Duquesne honors on the 1940-
all-city squad. Pittman Benghauser
and Donelliman Matisi earn sec-
ond-team tackle wordage. Nlatisi

annual .-

 

Dominates

is a brother of all-American Tony

Matisi, who will be recalled for his

stellar performances as a member

of Pitt's pre-“Dream Backﬁeld" ag-
gregation.

A1 DeMao, Duquesne’s triple-
threat center, is an unanimous na-
tion—wide choice for all-American
honors. And the Pitt News, though
original in many other respects,
refuses to differ on this particular
decision.

Only a player of DeMao’s far
above par calibre could have pre-
vented Kiltie gridder, Henry Ho-
lets from winning ﬁrst team hon-
ors unanimously. But Holets’ tal-
ents were both wasted and inhibit-
ed with Carnegie Tech’s 1941 squad.

That Ralph Fife should be pick-
ed as ﬁrst team guard, was a fore-
gone conclusion. Anything said
about the Canton llash would only
be repetition. Fife’s running mate
on the other side of the line is
Ben Keller, Duquesne sophomore,
whoiis deﬁnitely headed for “big
things" before he reaches sheep-
skin time.

In the smokey-city “it should on-
ly happen” backﬁeld, reading from

fullback to quarterback, are George i

Gonda, Edgar Jones, Bernie Semes,
and Walt West. Second team hon-
ors go to Duquesne’s John Binotti

and Phil Ahwesh, Scottie man Joe

Pash, and Pitt's Bill Dutton.

Virgil Cantini from the Tartan
clan deserves a word of mention if
nothing else for his early season
play. Had Cantini not watched the,
remaining ﬁve Tech games from’
the bench because of an injury, he
would have been a hard man to
keep freom the team.

Cantini's specialty is the pass.
Like Paul Christman of a few years
back, this footballer does not run
like a deer or block for keeps, and

come to think of it, he does not

punt with any brilliance, but, boy,
this fellow can pass.

Fresh Squad Ends Drills; "

Annual JV T

This season’s freshman football
practice sessions ended last week,
‘after two months of intensive drill-
ing. A scheduled game against the
varsity was called off because of
the Thanksgiving recess breaking
up the pre-season arrangements.

The frosh-varsity fray is an an-
nual affair which serves two pur-
poses. First, it gives the coaches
a better line on the material that
will be transferred to the varslig
next season and second, it is con-
sidered a special treat for the
freshmen players who have worked
so hard all season without playing
an official game.

Frosh candidates like Pat West,
Pete Fuderich, Glenn McCurdy,
Charles Surina, Bill Hafer, and
Bill Kain have been outstanding.
McCurdy has beentraveling at top
speed all season. He is ﬁve feet
eight tall, weighs 192 pounds, and
plays the guard position.

Pat West, brother of varsity
quarterback Walter West, has been
another standout on the line. West
has been working out at end this
season and did a good job of it
with the help of his six foot, 185
pound dimensions.

Fine kicking and good running
are the forte of quarterback Pete

. ’Fud’e1:ich. He been a sparkplug. -

ilt Cancelled

the squad and though he scales a
scant 170 pounds, his blocking
carries plenty of authority.

These boys are only a few of thie
many good ones who turned out
for freshman football practice this
season. About sixty-ﬁve men re-
ported; thirty-ﬁve were present at
the end‘. Because of the freshman
no-inter-colegiate playing rule,
some of the frosh did not have
much chance to show their wares,
but they will be eligible for varsity
drills next spring.

By JERRY RIPP
A few weeks ago the Pitt News
carried the story o'f the resigna-
”tion of James Potts, director of in-
tramural athletics, to be effective
January 1. Who is this man James
Potts? What kind of a man is he,
where did he come from, and where

JAMES POTTS
“I hate to leave”

is he going ? We thought you might

like to know more about his inter-

esting career.

Born in Balwin, Kansas, Febru-
ary 11, 1902, Potts entered Baker
university in 1918, where he was
a physics major. He minored in
mathematics and physical educa-
tion. While at Baker- he starred
in basketball and track for three
years, and won six varsity letters.
In his senior year he was captain
of the cage squad. ‘

After leaving Baker, Potts went
to Elkhart, Kansas, where he
coached football, basketball, track
and baseball. During his second
year there, Elkhart won the south-
ern Kansas football championship,

“ with 11 straight’ victories.

Eight years later in 1932, Carl
Olson came to Pitt as track coach,
and Potts became O,lson’s assist-
ant in handling the track team.

. And then in 1936, Potts took over

the lethargic intramural setup, and

. proceeded to completely revise it,

making it one of the finest in the

country.-

When he took over the intra-
mural directorship, Potts found
that only the fraternities took an
interest in intramural athletics,
and then only spasmodically. He
changed everything around, got
the engineers and independents in-
terested, and now over 1500 stu-
dents take part in intramural com-
petition annually. This in itself is
a fine tribute to Potts and the
work he has done.

Potts married his schoolgirl
s_weetheart in 1923, and has a
daughter 16, and a son 9. Other
outside interests besides his fam-
ily, are his two hobbies, photo-
;,,-graphy and the collecting of an-
’. tique glassware.

.. He started both about ten years
ago and goes in for them in a big
way. In-1936 he went to Berlin to

‘take pictures of the Olympics. In

rom   Jim Potts, Head  lntramurals
Flo Mr. James Potts, Estate Analyzer

touching on the trip Potts declared
that it was a “once in-a-lifetime
thrill.” He also said that it was
unique in that there were 50 differ-
ent nationalities there at once.

If «his new job permits, Potts
hopes to be able to go to the Pan-
American games in Buenos Aires
next winter and take technicolor
pictures of the colorful Argentine.

At the start of the new year
Potts will be ‘employed by the
Pittsburgh branch of the Connecti-
cut General Life Insurance com-
pany of Hartford. His work will
be that of estate analysis under
the direction of Hugh Kemp, and
he will have his office, in the Kop-
pers\ building, downtown.

Potts and track coach Carl Olson
have been very close since they
met in 1932 and Potts feels there
isn’t a more wholesome relation-
ship anywhere else in the Univer-
sity than that between Olson and
himself.

He doesn’t relish leaving Pitt,
but the new position is a better
one than he has here and is a
chance ‘for him to do better, and
no one begrudges his taking it.

In ,.leaving Pitt, Potts expressed.

a desire to thank the men students
for their cooperation with him in
making ‘intramural atheletics the
ﬁne thing they are at Pitt. Potts
declared that there is still room for
improvement and said, “It’s too
bad we can’t offer more facilities
for our student‘ body.”

He stated that he enjoyed being
here and said, “I feel that I have

Deadline Nears

For lntramural
Teams, Rosters

Once again the annual cry rings
out from the intramural oflice in
the Trees gym for entries. Direc-
tor James Potts issued a statement
today in which he stated that all
rosters must be in by Friday, De-
cember 5. ’

“With all the team’s rosters in
the office by Friday,” Potts continu-
ed,” we will be able to start our win-
ter season the following Monday.”

Basketball, the most popular of
all the intramural sports, will pro-
bably lead off the program—fol-
lowed by table tennis, bowling, and
volleybal.

Last year’s champions, Sigma
Alpha Mu and the Independents
will again be back in top form for
they have few losses if any
through graduation.

Bowling will again be staged at
the University Alleys which is situ-
ated on Craig Street near Forbes.
Amity Club won the crown last
year when they beat the fraternity
champs in three straight matches.

a whale of a lot of friends here.”

That Potts. will’ be missed at Pitt
is certain. Student leaders and fac-
ulty alike had nothing but praise
for him, when informed of his de-
cision to leave.

Cart Olson, track coach at Pitt
who has worked hand in hand with
Potts since 1932, said, “He’s the
best man I've ever been associated
with in track. He’s been true blue,
loyal and a hard worker. Hundreds
of track men will be sorry to see
him go.”

When,_we went to see Potts to
get the ‘facts for this story, and
told him that instead of talking
about intramurals, we wanted to
talk about him, he. said, “That
shouldn’t take long. There isn’t
.anything ‘to talk about.” That
statement’ is typical of Potts and
his modesty.‘

Getting away from our usual

procedure of picking the outstand-
ing sports ﬁgure of the Week, we
salute the six senior gridders that
were in the starting lineup last
Saturday against Carnegie Tech.
The players in the starting eleven
who played their farewell game for
the Blue and Gold were: Stan Ger-
velis, Ralph Fife, George Allshouse,
Johnny Stahl, Edgar Jones, and
Bill Benghauser.

For the past three years these
six footballers have given their
best for the Panthers on the grid-
iron. Last Saturday rolled around
much too fast for all of them and
as they left the field after the game
their swan song had been written
and their job was over.

Jones and Fife in particular have
stood out Saturday after Saturday,
and they appeared many times in
this column as the sports man for
that week.
