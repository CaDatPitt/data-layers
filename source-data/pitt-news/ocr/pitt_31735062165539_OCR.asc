‘Give in Thanks’ Set
As Pitt Chest Theme

. By JACKI KATZ
“At Thanksgiving —— Give in Thanks” is the theme of
the Pitt Chest campaign which will take place November 12
to 16, according to Robert Smith, chairman of the campaign.
During the week members of the campaign committee
will visit all organizations on campus and solicit for the fund.
They will have brochures, pledge cards, and other informa-

 

tion about the project and will¢

be able to answer any questions
that the students may have.

Information booths will be set
up near the student desks in the
SU and, Cathedral for students
who will not be contacted through
organizations.

Eliminate Solicitation ' _,-

“This is to eliminate the class-

room solicitation,’f said Smith.

" “We felt that classroom solicita-

tion ,was not keepingwith the

academic principals of the Uni- ~

versity.”

During the ‘week following
the campaign, letters will be
sent to all students not con- «
tacted during the first week.
The letters will contain a pledge
card and a reutrn envelope" so
that the studentsmay mail their ’
pledges back to the committee.;

Students may give cash or make

a pledge for any amount which

may be paid in installments.

Pledges will be by individual stu-

dents. Organizations will not be

asked to give unless they want
to, according to Smith.

to be a part of the charity work

Oaf the Mail Service. “Our problem

is that people do not address the
mail properly according to the
suggestions made in a directive to
all University departments con-
cerning the handling of all inter-
office University and U.S. mail,”
stated Muller for the primary
problem.

“The departments have ignored
this directive and‘ all other re-

quests to .aid the efficiency of the .

University Mail Service,” main-
tained Muller. He asserted that

the departments will not .coop'—.

erate. .
Returned Mail

“When mail is returned to the
department due to faulty or in-
adequate address, it _is returned to
the University without the errors
being corrected,” emphasized
Muller. "

-Muller pointed out" that the

second and largest problem is p

the congestion at the receiving
dock. “The U.S. Mail truck de-
livery canbe made but there
can be no pick up,” added
Muller. This problem is further
intensiﬁed by the fact that "when

_the U.S. Mail returns to pick up
the mail, the Post Oﬂice is clos-
ed. .

.“Mail service is further delayed
by ‘the lack of dollies to carry the
mail vbags,” remarked Muller. He
commented that there is a speciﬁc
difficulty obtaining the mail from
Schenleji Hall because the Univer-
sity Mail man must ﬁrst wade
through the orange peels, cigar-
ette butts and other rubbish be-
fore extricating the mail.

4 Must Put Up

“Wehave to put up with these
things‘ in order to run a good

service,” said Muller.

Muller showed that a typical
letter mailed’ in the Cathedral
would be immediately received
by the Post Oﬂice and sorted.
“Mail service in other halls is
picked up and delivered twice
daily by the University post-
man. ’ ' ‘-

“Since we handle 35,000 letters~

and packages daily we must move
the mail continua_l1y.. It never
stands and it all is stamped in the
U.S. Post Office by 6 p.m. every
evening,” declared the University
Post Qfﬁce supervisor.’
Suggestions to tie the mail up
into its speciﬁc categories, post

cards, air mails, packages, etc._

would be a great help to produc-
ing the utmost eﬁiciency, com-
mented Muller. He asserted, “As

for our service, it ‘could not be’

better. It moves all the time.”

Distribution-of.-studies require-
ments are being more strictly en-
forced for the winter trimester ,be-
cause there are now more special
distribution courses available, ac-
cording to Dr. Albert B. Martin,
Dean of the School of Liberal
Arts. 7' V '

- “Last year, many departments
did not offer special distribution-
of-studies courses, and students

were permitted to take other
courses,” Dr." Martin said.

The present requirements, initi-

.ated for freshmen entering in the .
fall of 1961’, are stated in the Stu-
dent Handbook and will be ex-

plained more fully in the new
Bulletin of the University to be
released in the latter part oftNo-

Confusion Resulted‘

' “Confusion may have resulted
since this change,” stated Dr.
Martin. “If so, studen.ts.,wil1 get
distribution credit in cases where
their advisors have developed
their programs to conform t_o the

spirit, rather than the letter, of"

the . requirements.

“The purpose of the distribu-
tion—of-studies requirements,” ex-
plained Dr. Martin, “is to provide
students with an exciting oppor-
tunity to take a look at many

and participation on the American campus. The apathy
of the l950’s is now being replaced by active concern for
, the future of the country and the world, the magazine
v_noted. Student promotion of both liberalism and conserva-
 tism was hailed as being highly admirable. A successful
 marriage of intellectualism and government was predicted.
And-then we have Pitt’s political thinkers.
, _ The recent friction between pickets and counter-pickets
I -« at the University once again illustrates the regrettable im-
: . maturity of certain publicity—seeking crusaders who sour

 our academic atmosphere. A ,
 President Kennedy’s decision on a course of action to-
; Ward Cuba and the Soviet Union, which had obviously been
 arrived at through careful pondering, was answered by
hyper-emotionalism by the ﬁrst group of campus sign-car-
/riers. Propelled by pure fear, these -demonstrators provided

a ready target for hecklers and counter-pickets with whom
« they eventually clashed. '
A The counter-pickets seemed driven’ not so much by
patriotism or courage as they were by the simple desire to
let, off steam by “mixing it up” with the paciﬁsts. Hecklers
. in the gallery managed only to exhibit their own frustra-
' tions at’a time when rational thinking was necessary.

And when it ﬁnally appeared that the President had

made--a historic coup for the United States and that the
 .world was not going to be destroyed by nuclear ﬁre, some
. A of thelsame students who had protested Kennedy’s _action
.held a demonstration praising the outcome of the crisis.
Somewhere in between these marches was a brief ‘bit of
placard-waving in which everyone’s right to peacefully
express his opinion in public was upheld. .
Freedom of expression, which has become a main issue
resulting from the demonstrators’ conflict, is an undeniable
right in this country as long as that expression does not in-

        

l of protesters is more than undemocratic——it’s shamefully
juvenile and embarrissing to the University community.
But what is as regrettable as the childish scufﬂing at
the demonstrations is the existence of a particularly fright-
‘_ .ening personality on campus. Thisis the person who will
‘ -peace the sidewalk for any cause at a moment’s notice. Give
him a sheet of cardboard and a box of crayons and he will-
protest anything for the sake of making a noise. This type
of person is abhorred by non-"demonstrators and earnest
pickets alike. Such behavior, which has been seen often
V at this and other colleges, is particularly unfortunate be-
‘cause it represents the antithesis of all that education
stands for. ’
‘If these various forms of political behavior constitute
the University’s contribution to the “revolution of student
interest and participation in politics”, then we welcome
the less embarrassing apathy of the last decade.

Moment of   Stress

The silence hung as thick as bug spray over
The Pitt News editorial ofﬁce last week as Presi-
dent Kennedy announced his seven-point, Cuban
proposal. Six or seven people sat around the ofﬁce,
some staring at the ﬂoral-pat- A
terned rug, some contemplating
grimy ﬁngernails, and others at-
tacking little strands of lint on
their sweaters. One girl, with
forced steadiness, reached for a
cigarette, struck a match, stared
cross-eyed at the ﬂame and lit
the micronite ﬁlter.

Those of you readers ,who
were in the cafeteria at 7 o’clock
on that Monday evening remem-
ber the deep-space quiet, broken‘
only by the scrape of ‘a chair_ against the tiled
ﬂoor, or a nervous cough." * .

Those ﬂattened nasal words did not reach their
full impact immediately- They bewildered, "they
dazed, they puzzled. Their fu"ll meaning 'was ob-

 

scured by the surprise of the moment. But _ob- \

serving the students in the oiﬁce and the _people in
the cafeteria was like watching a stretching rubber
ba_nd.. All ﬁber and substance was pulled away
from the middle- America had to stop an arms

build-up so near to her shores; but Cuba is a“

sovereign nation. lWhen diplomatic measures fail,

it is sometimes necessary to resort to force;‘ but an

show of force could mean, nuclear war.

Nuclear war. And snap, the rubber band pulled
everything back to the center again.

tion at the consequences which could result. For
others, the recipe was the same, but blended in
different proportions. Some experienced utter fear,
like the Pitt News reporter whose.ﬁance is sta-
tioned at Guantanomo Bay right now. Others joked
aboutthe balmy weather in Havana, or tomorrow’s
invitation from -the Department of the Army.

But coveringall, like a thin layer of polished
varnish which brings out the grain in the wood,
was a sense, but not a complete awareness, of abso-
lute uselessness; the overwhelming frustration of
not being able to control one’s fate. We existed
from hour to hour, awaiting radio news or reading
the releases from the UPI teletype in the WPGH
oﬂice. ‘And as the situation became more critical,
the feeling of helplessness became more acute.
Chess an en World Scale

It was like watching two masters at a chess
game. Youhoped for a stalemate; observing but
not understanding the development of play, yet still
deriving a certain excitement and pleasure from
the moves. ‘ - V ‘A  .

Well, the critical aspects of the situation are

. about ‘over now‘. Chairman Khrushchev has mag-

nanimously offered toremove ‘all missile bases from
Cuba, though one can never tell what‘will happen

in the next moment. The demonstrations have been _,

staged, fettered emo‘ti'onsVfreed, and tempers ap-
'peased,7a'nd. under thetenseness of the situation,
one can’t be too censorious of Ad Hoc committees
or their. opponents.

‘ It’s funny how a crisis can shorten the distance
between two places, but eventually everything will
return to normalcy. The space between Pittsburgh
and Havana will become 1400 miles again instead
of “a few miles”; the chess game won't, be as inter-
esting; and, hopefully, the rubber band won’t be
put to the test _again for a while.’

reesome  

By , Jim Kleinberg

The events of October 22-28 must go down in
history as one of ' the most important periods in
Soviet-American relations. It is now apparent that
Chairman Khrushchev has “backed down” in the
face of massive United States're- V
sistance and assured the world _
that the missiles now present in .
Cuba'will :be removed and no-
new ones sent. i

If we can assume (and its is‘
no meanassumption) that Chair-
man Khrushchev is sincere in
his retreat, what sort of ques-
tions can we false and answer
about the future of the ‘three
main actors in this drama?

Fidel Castro undoubtedly suf-
fered severe anxiety during the past week as his
base for support was pulled outlfrom under him.
Wheltever visions he might have had concerning
his role as leader of Latin America and a’ symbol
of Communism in the West_ern Hemisphere have
been shattered by the week's developments.

 

How can Castro go before his people and pro- V

“Yankee“Imperialism” when this unity has proven
to be a farce? A government such as Castro's must
of necessity rest on coercion. Remove the strength
"of the coercion and -the regime isplaced in a
perilous position. ' _

Obviously, there‘ is a deﬁnite correlation be‘-
tween Soviet support to Cuba and Castro’s per-
manance. The degree of Russiah support given to
Castro in the. future will determine how long he
lasts. If the Soviets have given gp on ‘Cuba
entirely, Dr. Castro is not going to be with us for
long. In/ any case, Castro’s fate .will probably be
decided within a few months.

Big K Requires Study ,

Nikita Khrushchev poses an interesting study
of miscalculation. He niiscalculated Kennedy’s
determination to stand firm on this issue; he mis-
calculated the abilities of the United States to
gather the information and prepare a solid case
against him before world opinion.

Chairman Khrushchev’s future is hard to pre-
dict, largely because there are two valid views as
to the nature of‘ his power. One view maintains

‘claim the unity of the Communist world against -

that Khrushchev‘ is a “middle "man" who mediates

  
 

    

between the “hard’.’ and “soft?

elite‘. ‘ This..view places

:

..Suslov and: ~..Mal

line members of the,

    

» as. wel

ovsky on the.“hard” side; and Mikoyan on the
“soft”_ side. A ’

The’ other view‘ maintains that it is a "basic-

necessityfor, a dictatorship which claims infalli-

‘bility to have avleader which is also infallible._
‘Therefore, this side reasons, Khru'shchev’s power is '

solid, he rules the country with an iron hand, and
‘his position of‘ leadership is not seriously ques-
tioned. But can we really'acce'pt. the second view?
I think’ not, in view of,the knownpand suspected
struggles for power. within the Sovietelite and in
View of Khrushchev's attempts to destroy a “cult

of personality” built around a once infallible leader, -

Stalin. _

If we go by the "first analysis of Khrushchev’s
power, it is obvious that there will be repercussions
for the Chairman in the months to follow. The

“soft” side may breathe a sigh of relief at having.

av’erted ‘a nuclear war and ‘criticize Khrushchev
for his miscalculations of American strength. The
“hard” side will point out Cuba as an example of
“American hostility’’ —- one that must be met with

- an‘ equal Soviet response, say, in..»B_er'lin. Khrush-

chev may’be'a nasty devil to deal with, but he may
also be the best adversary available of the current
‘high Soviet echelons.“ Once again, the next few
months may tell the tale. ‘
Kennedy Uber Alles

Finally, we‘ come-to John Kennedy. In this
crisis ‘Mr. Kennedy exhibited rare" resourcefulness
and ability in": one, planning and coordinating de-
fense, intelligence, and diplomatic resources inex-
treme secrecy; two, executing a plan of action with
deftnessand speed; and three,‘ rallying support’ for
the Unitedstates‘ in the Western Hemisphere and
in the United Nations.

As far as Mr. Kennedy’s future is concerned,
it is not only secure, ‘it is immensely enhanced by
the events of this week. The American people

have seen Kennedy at his best —— as an adm‘ini- ‘

strator and a tactian. Kennedy acted in such a
manner that he has won eunquestioning support
from the vast majority of Americans.

As an extra bonus, we have to say that Mr.
Kennedy’s prestige has climbed in NATO and the
hemisphere; for here, as'in most areas of politics,
respect, not friendship, is the key to leadership.
Further, ‘Mr. Kennedy’s actions have stated his

American Sincerity
Questioned By Student

‘Editor, The Pitt News ’

All Americans, I am sure,

La.

,, -d

J? ﬁrst nation ‘in the -history of the

world to have completefreedorn
of expression, as provided by the

Bill of Rights, guaranteed for
each and everyperson. '

incident‘ which gave me some
doubt as to the’ sincerity of some
Americans in upholding ‘ these
rights. The incident took place
‘in front of the University of
Pittsburgh when a small group
of students tried to conduct a
peaceful demonstration in order
to express their disapproval of
President Kennedy’s stand on
Cuba.

The demonstrators were quiet
and orderly but the crowd
which formed around them was
quite the opp_osite. They hurled
insults at the ‘demonstrators and

;‘ became almost vicious as they

ripped‘ the signs from and spat
‘on the defenseless demonstra-
tors. .

I say defenseless because dur-
ing the entire. episode _a group,
at least, ﬁfteen .City and Uni-
versity policemen, stood by and
watched as the crowd attacked
the demonstrators- and did not
lift a hand to__ stop it.

Finallyethe demonstrators who _

‘i tried to"walk on without their

,-1

‘~.

signs were forced by. the;press-
ing crowd to give up and seek

refuge in their dormitory "rooms. ,

I ask you: is this a w_ay for col-
lege students in the United
States of America to act? Is this
a way for the police, the sword
upholclers of our laws, to act?
Although _I disagree with the
opinions which the demonstra-

 _,__ tors were trying to express, I

 

‘~- disagree much more

strongly
with the actions of the crowd
and the police and I hope that

the people involved in this in- ‘

cident will realize how wrong
their actions were. .

Lack Of Protection
Seen As Real Cause

3*’ Editor, The Pitt News .

The mark of a free society is‘
the existence and expression of

divergent, - and", often vunpopul r.

principles of free speech and pe-
tition are stifled, the fpundations

of our democracy are “severely ‘
‘ undermined. ‘ -

The utter ‘disregard shown for

. the safety «of the students picket-

ing on ‘the Pitt campus were
worthy ‘of the most monolithic

police state. These persons, pick-
eting in ‘the most peaceful man-
ner, were obstructed,‘ viliﬁed,

, . i and physically attacked.
This afternoon I witnessed an .

iWhile- those onlookers who
were responsible for this imma-
ture, undemocratic action are to
be criticized for their narrow-

mindedness, the ultimate blame’

for such action which occured
‘rests with the public authorities

should have been extended to
these pickets; the rights‘ to [free
speech and assembly should
have "been upheld. '

The sight of public police of-

. ﬁcers standing passively by as

a few studentswereabused and
attacked was hardly a reassur-
ing sight. Especially now‘, in this
time"'of national crisis, should
we be on the watch for in-
fringements of civil right for
those‘ who would disagree‘ with
us. '

Theadulteration of the rights
of free» speech are tantamount to
the loss of all of our rights. The
history of the last sixty years
testifies to this.

Let it be known that I,com-
pletely disagree with the pickets

—vor Mr. Kennedy’s actions. Yet
free speech must exist for all.
When it ceases to exist, our
country will fall-heir to the sad

history’ of Nazi Germany, Fas-
cist Spain, and, yes, even Cuba.

Voltaire said, “I disagree with
what you say, but I will ﬁght

it." All of us, and especially our

public authorities, should never

Swetonic Knocked V’ '
For Alcohol Attitude

Editor,.The Pitt News

On Wednesday, October 17, a
column written by Matt Swe-
tonic was printed in The- Pitt
News which, in my opinion,
contained‘ ambiguous state-
mentsvin "respect to the Student
Government’s alcohol proposal.
As a member of the Senate of
the Student Governmen-t_and as

one of the drafters of the: alcohol ‘

proposal, I believe that Mr. Swe-.

tonic has let his imagination get-

the best of him. , ‘
The only objection that he has
to the proposal is that Student
Government is in charge of its
operations‘. He uses the past
Student Governments as a judge
for the present. Is this fair?
The present Student Govern-
ment under_ the revised repres-

~ entatives system has proven its '.
ability. Every activity that Stu--

dent'Government has participat-
ed in this year has been ex-
tremely ,, successful. But, Mr.
Swetonic does not think that
Student Government has the
ability to administer the alcohol
proposal. ’ _

campus, it is the responsibility
of the Student Government" to
support their desire.“

The alcohol proposal gives

every organization on campus

the privilege to drink to all —
a provision lacking in previous
proposals. C i

To cite one example, the Stu-
dent Union'Board will have the
opportunity (if the proposal is
passed by the students and the

administration) to serve.beer or
any alcoholic beverage at their
student union dances.

I.am in favor of the,Student ‘

- Opinion Poll Honesty

lnn Dorms Questioned

Editor, The Pitt News

They say beware of public
opinion ‘polls and statistics.
Well, it is only hoped that the
Administration will beware of
latest effort to push
through their"alcohol proposal.

According to" Student Govern-
ment’s vice-president, the alco-
hol opinion pool was to be “an
opportunity for students to ex-

press their opinions.” The fol-__4 

lowing was part of what»hap-

pened on one particular ﬂoor‘ or V it

a men’s dormitory.

Biased questions.‘ were asked: ,4, A

by pollsters, such as, “We’d like

to have your vote for a wet cam-“"

pus.” When a, student replied
emphatically “no” and gave his‘
reasons for it, the pollsters sim-

ply could not believe it. They ar- ‘_

gued until they finally believed‘

that this one wasreally hope‘-Q 

less, but one “no” wouldn’-t hurt,

them anyway.

Knocking on another door,
gollsters‘ faced a half—asleep'. ‘
resi ent. When this student’ said _ ,_
‘no, -the pollsters badgered him .,
until the sleepy student gave in‘ ‘

th e,

and said .yes. A few minutes
later, when the student ﬁnally
realized‘ what he had said he

.ran over to the “opinion takers"

and told them to change his vote
to “no.” They put down a “no"
all right, but forgot one little
thing. To erase his “yes.”

If the poll was carried on in

all the dorms as it was in this_ . 

one, it is meaningless. How cang
a wet campus ever be,'if Stu-

dent Government, who is sup- ' 

posed to be in charge of this
proposal, cannot even carry out

an honest opinion poll?

From Hong

By NANCY FUCHS

' David Epperson, a graduate student in the School of
Social Work, has recently returned from a year of work at
YMCA World Service Secretary to Hong Kong.

He was one of four North

‘graduates or graduate students who held responsible stu-

dent positions in the YMCA,
The other three were assigned toO
Istanbul, Caracas, and Lima.

His duties included working
with students of ten colleges in
programming activities, sports,
concerts, and discussion groups
for the YMCA. He also taught
conversational English.

Different Culture

Of his experiences there, Ep-
person relates, “It gave me an
opportunity to become involved in
a different culture, in being the
only Westerner in a Chinese or-
ganization. I had an opportunity
to learn much more than I ever
could have learned by any aca-
demic means.”

He was most impressed by
the generaltrend of scholarship
among the Chinese youth. Ac-
cording to Epperson, “Chinese
students are the most conscien-
tious students I’ve ever seen.
Opportunities are few, and
competition is rough. They
work extremely hard because
they realize how difficult it is
to get into college in Hong
Kong.”

Originally from Donora, Pa.,
Epperson interrupted his educa-
tion at the University l.o join the
Air Force during the Korean War.
After four years in the service,
he returned to the University, and,
in 1961, he received his B.A. in
political science.

Active In YMCA

Epperson has been active in the
YMCA for five years, serving as

president of the University's
branch of the “Y” in his senior
year.

In the summer of 1960,‘ he

Stern Organizer

Eric Stern, Arts junior, an or-
ganizer of this demonstration, felt
the publicity his group received
Friday through the local televi-
sion stations and newspapers
helped them get the sympathy of
the public. Stern said, “Though
our view hasn’t changed since
Friday, we were considered com-. A
munists then, and patriots now
that the missles are being dis-
mant1ed.”

M u c h controvery resulted
from the clash of students dur-
ing the ﬁrst demonstration on
Friday. Harry"-McConnell, ﬂoor
counselor in Holland Hall, con-
siders the affair “the ‘most
shameful behavior by college
students that I have seen.”

A number of other students ex-
pressed opinions that the city po-
cile reacted ineﬁectively and in-
differently.

WORDS TO THE ‘WISE

The infamous sleeper-play which woke up the Panthers
Saturday against Navy was no accident. “I don’t Want to give
the details of the play,” said Quarterback Roger Staubach.
“We might want to use it against someone else.”

Wayne Hardin: “We cut our skull session short to hear
the President’s speech last week. Our boys are a little closer
to the situation than other colleges.”

John Michelosen’s reply: “Who is trying to kid whom? If
something happens next week, my boys are in the front line.

yThey won’t have a chance to ﬁnish school.”

Broadcaster Jack Henry says he wishes that he had
Beano Cook as his publicity man.“ He has ‘people believ-
ing that Paul Martha is the greatest back in the history
of Pitt,” Henry said. “It’s now gospel, too, that Martha
is better looking than Frank Gifford.”

Dry days have co/mle upon the Trees Hall swimming pool

been cancelled because of lack of customers. David Brewer,
Director of Purchase Services, said that the cost of running
them "for the few people_who used them was prohibitive.

Regular campus bu‘s,._service is, of course, available, and
there is a possibility that if moreinterest is shown, the extra

  Corky Cuthbert Horrifies Foes
S   W7ith Tape

Wrappingls, Deft Toe
By Git. McDONALD  H "

High-scoring Bob Cuthbert is the most heavily-taped‘
man onthe Pitt soccer team next to goalie Tom Staab, but

iv’ Cuthbert’s tape is a necessity rather than a precaution.

“That boy ldoesnit have a ligament _in hisiknees,” said
‘ former freshman coach, and varsity’ star Dick Kipp. The ten
to fifteen minutes Cuthbertspends in the training room

prior to taking the ﬁeld are vital.._

Cuthbert came to Pitt in the
falllof 1959 and ‘immediately be-
came scoring star of a strong
freshman team. Late in the sea-
son, however, he hurt one knee,
and the next fall, after a collision

was as a freshman, and is un-
able to lock his knees for a
quick halt, Cuthbert'is never-
theless a deft dribbler, and pos- _
sesses enough speed to be a
breakaway threat. ’
He is a terror to opposing goal-
ies not only because of his can-
non—like shot, but also because of

had to be helped off the field, his
soccer future doubtful.

i-,_y.._..-.._.. .-

Mummified Scorer

Cuthbert could still‘ run, though,
and as far as he was concerned,r
he could play. With both legs
taped from mid-calf to the mid-
dle of his thigh, and recently
wearing a hinged brace on his
right knee, he is still kicking.

He has kicked ten goals this
season for a career total of 27,

5. 3:34’ which breaks Jerry Bressanelli’s
* \ record of 24, set in‘ 1954.

His value to the team extends
beyond his ‘scoring, however.

 
 

his quickness and experience. His
goal on a diving head ball against
Howard demonstrates his versa-
tility. He further fulfills his mis-
sion as center-forward by alertly
harassing goaltenders.

Corky Cuthbert is equipped as
a soccer player to beat Pitt’s soc-
cer opponents in almost any man-
ner possible. (In practice, during
his freshman year, he occasionally
took. a turn in the goal). He has
more than a third of the team’s

twenty-‘seven goals so , far, and-
. should spearhead ‘_

The Orangemen have also drop-

games to Oklahoma and Army,

College before losing a 20-19 de-

“It’s going to take us a while
to ﬁnd some boys,” Schwartz-

The Syracuse coach, however,
is not underestimating the Pan-

the Panthers will be tougher than

‘ "Coach Carl Rees, after the hu-

Panthers in every meet last year,

plained Coach Rees. “He had a
real bad season in track and he
became discouraged. He fell out
of shape and lost much of his in-
centive. He could have really be-

come the leader the team needs.” -

ANOTHER CHANGE

The team, meanwhile, will have
a week to recover from the West
Virginia holocaust. They will meet
the Mounties again in Morgan-
town on November 10. The Moun-
taineers defeated the Panthers
there last year, 25-30, despite an
easy victory by Waslo.

ference——Rees

“Our main trouble seems" to
be the start and the ﬁrst two
miles. We can’t run a slow two
miles and expect to win,” Coach
Rees explained.

“I was very pleased with the
freshman meet,” Rees noted.
“Dave Eichenlaub and Don Hinch—
berger ran very well.” Ralph Mor-
risey of ,West Virginia won in-
dividual honors, posting the sec-
ond «best time ever run on the
freshman course. He covered the
2.8 miles in 13:27, ‘only two sec-
onds oif the record.

C Penn State Freshmen Nix Plan 3?
To Play Football Against Panthers 

“This Was /the ﬁrst season I
have seen two cancellations due
to injuries,” said frosh Coach Kal-
iden, reﬂecting , on the second

_half of the Cubs’ disasterous 0-2

campaign. '

But the fresh mentor added
that he tried everything in his
power to have his healthy play-
ers see more action this season.
In fact, Kaliden negotiated the
possibility of permitting Pitt and

Penn State “fifth string’-’varsity
men” to play in last Saturday’s
scheduled contest with State. _
Even. though the Nittany frosh
were as plagued with injuries as
the Cubs‘, they weren’t as eager
to play, declining Ka1iden’s sug-
gestion. “I really would have

liked to see another game,” com-
mented Kaliden. “The fellows

 

could have used the experience?”

  Representatives Meet 
 F or ‘People -to - People’

SG President Attends

Conference Designed

To Aid Foreign Students in Pennsylvania
University’s representative Tom Olofson, Student Gov-

-ernment president, was one of 70 representatives from the

academic institutions in Pennsylvania that met last weekend
to discuss the “People-to—People” university program. The
conference was called byDavid Lawrence, governor of Penn-

A

sylvania. v
The “People-to-People” pro-
gram works on international,

community and university V level.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower is
the chairman of the board of
trustees, President John F. Ken-

.nedy is the Honorary Chairman,

and Joyce C. Hall, president of
Hallmark greeting cards company,
is the chairman of the executive
committee. ,
Olofson disclosed that he was
very impressed with “a most
worthwhile organization.” He re-
vealed the SG foreign student
proposal to the group “which im-

 pressed a number of delegates

who asked copies be sent to
them.” '

' People Interested

“With 15 percent of internation-
al students in the state at the Uni-
“People-to-People" are
very interested in speaking with
SG further," Olofson con-
tinued.

The University level activities
of “People-to-People” is com-
pletely run by students at the
college. Headquarters of the
university program is in Kansas
City, Missouri..

Ololson said that SG will carry

I out plans for the foreign students

as soon as possible and hope to
incorporate new ideas from the
“People-to-People” and “l o o k
into the possibility of establishing

.0 a chapter at the University.”

Meetings Called

V Governors of all states called’
"meetings, as did Governor Lawr-

ence, at the university level by
contacting all university heads
and asking them to send represen-
tatives.

This

level is just being or-

 ’ganized and the colleges have

the option of taking up this pro-

gram.

7 At all levels “People-to-People”
programs stand for and encourage,
the dedication of re-
sources, time and “know how,”
improving man’s lot on earth
spiritually, intellectually, physic-
ally, and mentally.

Aid Programs
‘ Specifically, it has programs to

' aid in the understanding and aid-

ing the foreign students. To learn
about them and assist in assim-
ilating them into our society while
here and making their stay in this
country worthwhile, pleasant and
successful; not only to help them
and learn their ideas and desires.

The program, in short, encour-
"ages promotion of understanding
and goodwill along with friend-
ship among the students of the
world. It emphasizes thinking on
an International scale, and allows
these studentsto see all facets of
American life, experience Amer-
ican hospitality, and make strong
friendships.

A MAJOR FEATURE of the Uni-
versity of Colorado’s new program
for the education and training of
college and university
teachers is a three year course of
study which begins in the junior
year and ends with the presenta-
tion of a Master of,.Arts degree.

‘WHITE-COATED

Cgﬂillltﬂ E'3QU§ ‘TTWEDE

Don’t let this girl's costume fool you. She’s not really a
’mad scientist. She’s a girl—-a real, live girl. It’s just that
she has to prove something-to herself and to her family.

She has to prove that she has a brain and that, if she
ever has to compete with men on their own terms, she
can do it-and win. But she really doesn’t want to com-
pete with men. In her heart she wants to attract men
and eventually, marry one. The girl watcher should not
let this situation disturb him, however. *

If the girl is watchable, she should be watched, no
matter what her motives or ambitions may be. The same
thing is true of a cigarette. If it’s smokeable, it should be
smoked-and Pall Mall is the most smokeable of all!

Pall Mall’s natural mildness
I is so good to your taste!

S_o smooth, so satisfying,
so downright smokeable!
