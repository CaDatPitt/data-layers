Pitt Percentage High

A few statistics point out the
contribution Pitt is making to the
medical welfare of Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania. Out of
3,277 doctors practicing in West-
ern Pennsylvania,‘ 1,994 are Pitt
graduates. At the present time,
98 per cent of the students now
in medical school are from Penn-
sylvania.

In dentistry, 1,995 out of a
total of 2,475 practicing den-
tists in Western Pennsylvania
are Pitt" graduates. And with
an acute shortage of dentists
in the state, the Dental School
is operating at top capacity with
severely taxed facilities.

The entire medical center is a
complicated but closely integrated
organization thatrhas as its aim
the training‘ of under and post-
graduate students in the health
professions, research, and com-
munity health service.

The story cannot be told in one,

or even a dozen articles, but in“

succeeding weeks the Pitt News
will attempt topresent the story
of medical progress here at Pitt,

R-I-L Banquet
By JOAN THOMAS

“Faculty and student spokes-

year’s Religion-in—Life Week
after a banquet Wednesday
evening at the Nurses’ Resi-
dence..

Dr. Henry S. Frank, head

of the chemistry department, gave
his impressions of the program
asga faculty member at Pitt.

He stated that the three day
activities» “leaves too much for

that, to have significance,__ we
should carry it on and have as
parts of our lives the whole
year.

He stated that “people inter-
ested in religion are expected to
hold an apologetic air.” He be-
lieved that it is up to us to over-
come this fallacy that exists in
every‘ university.

Frank asserted that religion
is often considered a hangover,
since all areas are now dealt
with by science. He refuted this,
stating that religion is, some-
thing that cannot be dispensed
with.

and how it concerns the Pitt stu-
dent. ~

9 Jim DeWeese, editor of the Pitt

dent got out of Religion-in-Life
Week.” He said that it was much
more than anrintense three day
accent on religion.

He stater‘ that the students,
those who took part as well as
nonparticipants, had benefited
widely. He believed that those
who had worked on the func-
tional end of the program had
gained in phases of administra-
tion, in addition to the thoughts
and ideas which the various
speakers emphasized. '

DeWeese asserted that students
who had not participated in the
planned events had gained from
the general spirit, through dis-
cussions that carried into the Tuck
Shop, cafeteria, and classrooms.

He believed that all students
had gained something from Re-

ligion-in-Life Week, although
for many it would not be real-
ized until later life. ’

Dr. Hayes speaks and prays
from his heart ' with a vigor
which is contagious.~ And when
he talks it seems that he sets
his gaze toward things greater.
His eyes are those of a thinker

be expressd.

When he speaks, one must stop
to listen, for the words are words
of an authority not only on the
Far Eastern problem, but on the
value of spiritual guidance.

Beard Saves Life

It was faith on his part and a
knowledge of the Buddhist reli-
gion that helped him to escape
from a Chinese prison—faith and
his beard. I

That a beard could save a life
sounds like an item for“ Believe
it or not.” That was the case of

When. he returned to his birth-
place, China, after having studied
in‘ the United States, Dr. Hayes
began an energetic career in mis-
sionary work. He was arrested by.
the Communist regime and im--
prisoned in Kweiyang.

But a cold prison wind rud-
died his face and a prominent
beard grew awry and bushy.
After some time, he began to
resemble pictures of Karl Marx.

His Chinese Buddhists captors
were firm believers of transmi-_
gration of the soul after death,
and paradoxically had been con-

They discovered that Dr. Hayes
was born three years after Karl

By ED BACHMAN

School elections are coming up soon and just how much
do you know about them? How much do you, the voter,
know about the oﬁices which are at stake in this election
period? How much do you, the potential candidate, know
about the offices available, and the responsibilities of such?

Too little is known of Pitt’s political functions. We are
losing good potential candidates at this college because few
of. us know what offices can be obtained, the eligibility con-
cerned, and how to go about getting nominated-.

Elections will be held this month for positions in three
organizations—-Student Congress, Men’s" Council, and the

Women’s Self Governmen
sociation-—plus 11 class presidents.
If you were interested in running
for one of these jobs, how would
you go about it? ' _

The Student Congress has
jurisdiction over those affairs
which concern men and women .
together.

Congress is open to male and
female nominees. Eleven men and
eight women will be elected to
this group on Mar. 30. The ratio
is split as follows: Men, four sen-
iors, four juniors and three sop-
homores--Women: three seniors,
three juniors and two sophomores.
If interested in applying f or a
nomination, a petition must be
completed with 250 names. These
names can be obtained from any
of the schools at the University.

Maybe you will be interested
in serving on the Men’s Council.
If so, you have two. paths to fol-
low. You may be elected class
president or you may try. for one
of the 12 at-large positions. "

The at-large representatives are
elected only from the College,
E&M, and Bus. Ad. schools. The
senior-junior-sophomore ratio is
as follows; College, 2-2-1;’ E&M,
2-1-lj and Bus. Ad., 1-1-1.

With the new opportunities in
religion courses at Pitt and a
deepening of personal religious
beliefs through the Religion-in-

sions is beingordered by the Pitt
chapter of the intervarsity Christ-
Ian Fellowship.

The seminar will be held every
Tuesday from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.

a deeper understanding of Christ-
ian missions.

Leading the group is Margaret
Grohman, Col. ’55', who is prepar-

The seminar is unique in that
interest and study in mission work
has never. before been met at the
University.

of the I.V.C.F. invites all faculty
members and students to member-
ship. Dr. Rosalind Branning, po-

Night School Offers Top Program;

Night Enrollment
Larger Than
Day School

By GERRY BENKOVICH

“Since 1907, the Pitt Evening
School has steadily grown until it
is now larger than the day school,”
said Dr. Carroll F. Reynolds, as-
sistant director of evening school.
Last year’s night enrollment was
10,244 students.

Although the evening school has
one of the largest degree programs’
in the country, the enrollment can
clearly be divided into three
groups. “Roughly there are 4000
non-degree, 4000 graduate, and
only 2000 undergraduate stu-
dents,” according to Reynolds.

The large number of non-de-
greed students are not working for
a degree, since over half of them

are mostly here to make up deﬁ-
ciencies or for refresher courses.
Most .of the graduate group are
teachers working for their mas-
ter’s or doctor’s degrees.

The smallest group are the
undergraduates. “Theoretically,
they can get a degree in live
years,” said Reynolds, “but we
have students attending classes
from ﬁve to thirty years.”

The social schedule for evening
students includes square dances
and a semi-formal. Chapel serv-
ices are also included on their
calendar) The ten fraternities and
sororities include honorary, pro-
fessional, and social groups.

“Will I have a better chance in

Dr. Reynolds feels this innova-
tion provides an “exchange of in-
formation with the day students.”
It makes evening students “more
integrated and better acquainted
with the University.”

Almost every occupation—
from bank president to truck
driver—is represented in even-
ing classes, he said. Students
range from 18 to 70 years of age
-and come from all directions, as
far as 120 miles or more. One

doctor’s degree. /

After comparing them with day-
students, most instructors stated
that they prefer teaching evening
students. Or as Dr. Reynolds said,
“Evening students aren’t always
looking for ways to get out of
classes. They possess more ‘prac-
tical’ knowledge. In some. areas
they know more than the instruc-
tor. In general, they’re an excel-
lent group of students who are
here to learn something.” -

Much Variety

Dr. Reynold’s history has shown
as much variety as that of the stu-
dents he directs. Before getting
his master’s and doctor’s degrees
at Pitt, he received two B. S. de-
grees, - one. from Columbia Univer-
sity and one from West Virginia
University. I P

In his career he has been a phy-

sical education teacher at a small
West Virginia college, librarian at
Oklahoma A&M, and shipbuilder
in Pittsburgh with the Dravo Cor-
poration. He ﬁnally became af-
ﬁliated with Pitt by writing his.-
tory at Fort Belvoir, moving to
his present position in 1946. '

All Must Gain

Religion—I'n-Life_Week* ended two_d_ays ago. To say that
a three day emphasis does no good or is hypocritical would
be fallacious reasoning foundedon a very shaky premise.

Those students who devoted a measure of their time to
the Week must have gained. With men of the calibre who

addressed classes and conducted ﬁreside discussions, it would.

I be almost impossible for a thinking student to leave with no

new ideas. a , _

‘ The week was wider reaching than many students rea-
lize. Such a realization may not come for years, but even
those students who stampeded ‘to the Tuck Shops as the
Convocation began on Monday must be touched in some
way by one or more of the myriad offshoots of the program.

To say that those who took no part, who listened to
no discussions or talks, are ‘unthinking-students. would be
erroneous. But it does-appear that their sense of values is

, slightly warped. For those same students willgspend fourty-

eight‘ dollars for a three credit elective but would not spend
forty-eight minutes listening toa Religion-In—L1fe speaker.
They would not bother to listen to the words of a man who

. has experienced things far beyond their own ‘abilities, things

with which they may never come in contact,
To have such an opportunity presented which demands

so little time and almost no effort and then to disregard .-

thatopportunity entirely fails to make the grade as rational
thinking. It isin keeping with those who are here only
to claim a degree and not to learn.

Religion cannot be slammed down the throats of re-
luctant students. The speakers knew this. Their talks and
discussions were aimed toward stimulating thought pro-
cesses. Unfortunately there still appear to be a number of
students who ‘do not care formental stimulation. a

Pitt's~Medica| School Grant .. .0- I

What Does it Mean’.-"R

By Jim Deweese
Last year Pitt’s Medical School accepted a grant
of $15,000,000 to be used in the expansion of the
faculty and staff. Many students made no effort to
mask their rebellion over the fact that this sum

was directed to only one segment ‘of the University.‘

Those who dispute the worth of such a grant do
so, perhaps, because they fail to realize just how
their lives and the well being of
their friends and families will be
aﬁected in future years as a di-
rect result of that grant.

Within the Medical School at
Pitt, basic research is being done
which may ultimately result in
the conquest of diseases such as

'cancer. But research is not the
only facet of the school. Of equal
importance and concern to the
staff are the ﬁelds of education and service.

Top Educators a Must

The grant was established with the purpose of
attracting top educators, leaders in every phase of
medicine. It is through such men that the repu-
tation for high calibre graduates must originate.
It is no longer enough to teach text book medicine

to students. They must be informed on the facts,
'5‘ of the moment, the strides which are being made

"The only clue I'll give you is_,thal- it came ’from the

every day in the vast ﬁeld of which they hope to
become a member.

In past years the clinical areas of study at the
school were taught by a volunteer staff. ,These
areas are perhaps the most important in the school
for it is the people interned in the clinics who are
the tools with which the students must work. A
more expensive form of instruction is seldom found.
Guinea pigs may be had for the price of a pack of
cigarettes. Human lives come higher.

Services Cover Many Aspects

The service function‘ of the school compasses
several areas.“ It has resulted in the provision of
a higher standard of medical men in the Western
Pennsylvania area. Of the 2649 living graduates
ofthe school, 1994‘ are still practicing in this area.
These men represent over 75 per cent of the gradu-
ates. . ' I

The diagnostic facilities and treatment which‘

are available at the clinic provide a service to this
area which is second to none. A team of doctors
working on various phases of heart surgery are
experimenting in realms which a few years ago

Unifield Government Urged

would have been dismissed as impossible. Radia-
tion therapy is another ﬁeld in which the Medical
School leads. The cyclotron, with its production of

radio isotopes, has been in use since the’ end of

world war II as a tool of research and a cure for
many disorders. ’
Not Self Liquidating ‘ .

Such facilities are not self liquidating. The cost
of such treatment would be far‘ above what most/
people could afford. Furthermore, the purpose of
the Health Center would be defeated if inferio
treatment or supplies were used. V

Everyone is, by now, aware of the research that
Dr. Jonas'Salk is doing in the ﬁeld of Polio. The
man in the street doesn’t know the extent to which
that research has gone since its beginning and he
doesn’t care. He does know that someday the count-
less hours of work may result in the saving of his
child’s life. ' ~ ‘

Results For Reachin , .

The results of most of the researchnow under-
way at the school will someday be felt throughout
the world. Dr. Robert Klein is working on en-
docrine growth in children. His work relates di-.
rectly to acute Lukemia and other cancers, diseases
which are killers today, but like Smallpox and
Scarlet Fever, may become almost unknown in the
future.  ,

Dr. T. S. Danowski ,through his research in the
area of metabolic diseases in children and adults,
is in the ﬁeld of Muscular Distrophy, a horribly
crippling disease which must go almost untreated,
leaving little or no -hope for its victims.
Walking Scar Tissue ,

Dr. I. A. Mirsky is working with Diabetes and
related mental diseases. Fora person in good health,

—it is impossibleto realize what such research may

eventually. mean to the thousands of people who
must live by the clock and the hypodermic needle.

’ People who must give themselves daily injections

and,’ as a result, are a mass of scar tissues. _

These are three. There are many more. All are
working_ behind the doors of their laboratories to_
eliminate disease, to save lives, and to insure that
those lives will be ones of good health. Their faith '
in what they are doing is undeniable, in the face

— of international ‘emphasis ‘on atomic warfare. With

such a faith, with an -understanding of their work,
there wouldhave been. no need for the headlines ‘
which‘ appeared in last Wednesday’s Pittsburgh
Press, “WAR MAY BE WEEKS OFF, GENERALS
IN ASIA WARN.”

ment, particularly now in the

Tuck Shop.
We have also
criticized, but
,with a possi-
ble solution
i n m i n d ,
SC, MC, and
WSGA Commission are contin-
ually stepping on one another’s
toes. They are three jealous,
.warring factions. SC is weak
and stagnant. It should be the
main organ of government,
higher than the other two. MC
_ and WSGA are separated by a
wide abyss, neither understand-
ing the signiﬁcance of the other.
They should be brought together
and uriiﬁed.

Central Unit Planned
Why don’t we have a central,

    

‘ coordinated unit of student gov-

ernment that will represent both
men and women as a whole as
well as separately?

According to the ten’s _sug-
gestion, MC would take care of
matters that deal exclusively
with men, for example men’s
conference program, men’s cus-
toms and traditions. Likewise,
WSGA would take care of
women’s affairs, such as guilds,
iRose Tea, etc. '

P,rop‘ortioning Suggested
’ However, both bodies should

i be proportional because of the.

 

  

4 to 1 ratio of men to‘ women
students Thus MC would be
larger than WSGA Commission.
This proportioning would be a

delicate problem, but could be
worked out with care and re-
search. As now,‘ each person on
MC or WSGA Commission would
have an oﬁices or be a repre-
sentative, for example, of men’s
and women’s classes and organi-
zations. This will give organiza-
tions their deserved say in stu-
dent life, as you will see in a
minute. a \‘

llnification ’ Described

Now the radical—but coordi-
nating, unifying, and centralizing
change comes in. All members
of MC and WSGA Commission
would make up SC. This body
would have jurisdiction over
those affairs which concern men
and women together. This
change would make everyone on
SC represent something. It
would rid us of many needless
members who right now repre-

. sent nothing.

Of course, there is the dis-
advantage of one person holding
an important office in WSGA or
MC and also an executive office
in SC. This would overwork the
individual to the point of in-
competence. Therefore the men
would elect ﬁv.e_ men with the
express purpose of becoming
officers of SC.

The women would also elect
five women to become officers of
SC. Then these ten would be
elected in an internal election by
SC to the usual offices of "presi-
dent, / vice-president, two secre-

aries, treasurer and five com-

a mittee chairman. » A

_Women's Voice Effective

. Now in SC men would have 5

larger repijesentatiori naturally.
.I_ «K J‘. * 

  

because MC and WSGA are pro-
portional. But women would, we
believe, have a ‘strong minority
which would give them an

effective voice in student govern-
ment. ‘

V This is a more‘ eﬁicient system
to propose ideas. If SC, decides
that something does not concern
both . men and women, they
would refer it to the appropriate
organization. ,

A problem such as the recent
political parties issue would not
have arisen. Such a proposal in-
volving both men and women

‘"~ would not have originated in one

body disregarding the other. It
would have been brought up in
SC.

At present, probably because
of the proportion of men to
women, it seems MC and SC
lean toward the DOM’s office
and WSGA is inclined toward
the DOW’s office. Their advice
and suggestions would still be
essential, however each would

have a more direct interest in,

SC in addition-to their own part-
icular groups (MC or WSGA);

Open Letter
An open letter to the student body:
The Commission of WSGA, the

group elected by the women'stu-
dents to formulate policies for

. them, has not voted on the recog-

nition of political parties. There
has been, however, a thorough dis-
cussion of the issue. We would
like all the Pitt students to know
this and to understand the points
of View that evolved through free
discussion in Commission meet-
ing.

1. We do not wish to estab-
lish political parties for women
because we believe that our
present election system serves
the interests of all women bet-/,
ter than a political party sys-
tem could.

2. We believe that Student
Congress does not have the pow-
er to legislate'for men separately
or for women separately on any
issue. That power lies with
Men’s Council and WSGA'Com-’
mission respectively.

3. If Student Congress, with-
in the authority given through
its by—laws, has the right to es-
tablish political parties oﬂicially,
and wishes to do so, they must
include women as well as men.’
Anything ‘else would be class
legislation and illegal for a gov-
erning body recognized by the
University to have jurisdiction
over those affairs which con-
cern‘ men and women together.

4. The policy of WSGA Com-
mission is to allow each woman
student the privilege of exer-
cising her own judgment in this
and every other issue as she
sees ﬁt. It is not a regulatory
body.

5. Commission has and will
continue to do its best to clarify
to the women students the issues

To Students V

involved in -any party system
and to let them make their own
free choices.

6. From our point of view the
proposed political parties, recog-
nized or not, are negative for
the following reasons: (a.) They .
foster division not on the basis
of real issues within Congress,
but on the basis of loyalities to
groups on the outside. (b.) They
tend to discourage free thinking
because an individual. party‘
member feels ‘obligated to sup-
port party opinion rather than
to establish his own ideas.

'7. The women students,
through the Congress by-laws,
are guaranteed eight seats. We
believe the interests of the
whole University will be best
served if they choose to run
without any slate backing. This
however, each girl must decide
for herself. Her decision, what-
ever it might be, will be respect-
ed because a University com-
munity respects individual dif-
ferences and opinions-

The women ask only to be‘ in-
cluded as an integral part of Stu-
dent Congress on matters which
concern men and women in their
life together, and to be se1f-de-
termining in matters of concern
to women alone. The by—laws of
Student Congress and of WSGA,
as‘ officially recognized by the Uni-
versity, guarantee this. ‘ '

Endicott A. Batchelder, assistant
University registrar, ﬂew to Den-
ver, Colorado last week to assist
in the formation of the U.S. Air
Force Academy which is being
planned at Lowry Air Force Base.
Concerning his trip, Batchelder

says, “It was a very marvelous ex- _

perience. They treated me like a
staff member, inviting me to at-
tend all the conferences and mak-
ing all -their records available to
me.” ,
Worked Five Days

Acting as a civilian advisor,
Batchelder helped to work out
problems of processing applica-
tions, to keep records of grades,
and general registration work. He
worked for ﬁve days on these and
many other problems. Mainlykhe
was concerned with registration
records and IBM procedures.

Batchelder became very in-
terested in the new academy
which will be similar to West
Point and Annapolis. . A

The academy will admit new
cadets on the basis of several
rigid exams. They’ll have to take
a physical ' examination, several
aptitude tests for piloting, observer
training and College Board Exam-
inations.

In order to be eligible for this
series ofitests, students must ﬁrst
be appointed by a senator, con-
gressman, the President, or Vice
President of the United States.

Swimmers Climax Year
Seeking Fourth Crown

A By AL PELAEZ

The climax to a brilliant season comes for
Coach Ben Grady’s tankers today and tomorrow
as they strive for their fourth consecutive Eastern
Collegiate championship at Rutgers.

‘ A win would give the mermen one of their most
successful seasons in many years since they have
already compiled a ﬁne 7-1 dual meet record.

Even though the Panthers are the favored en-
try in the Easterns, they will have to be at peak
performance to capture their fourth consecutive
victory. Leading the opposition will be dity College
of New York, this year’s Metropolitan champion,
Kings Point, Rutgers and New York University.

Leading the way for the Panthers are two de-
fending Eastern champions. Jim Zurcher captured
the 220 and 440-yard freestyle events last season
while Skip Monsein took ﬁrst place in the 100-yard
backstroke and ﬁnished runnerup in the 200-yard
event. Monsein was also a member of the medley

a relay team which captured the Donald R. Fanning

Memorial Trophy, annually awarded to the winner

of the 300-yard medley relay. ,
* Others expected to score heavily for the Blue"

and Gold are diver Ralph Gaetano, who took ﬁfth
place in last year’s Easterns, Roy Kaupe and Hank
Zentgraf, who swam on the 400-yard freestyle relay
team which placed second in last year’s competi-
tion, and team captain, Bill Furrer, who placed
third in the. 440-yard freestyle last year. ‘
Two Panther sophomores have also given indi-
cation that they will be heard from. Warne White
has become the man to beat in the individual med-
ley by virtue of his wins over Lehigh’s Ed Dederer
and Don Johnson of Rutgers. . ,

_ White also is being counted on to place high in
the freestyle sprint events. Bert Marks will also
be making his ﬁrst Eastern appearance and is ex-
pected to place well in the diving event.

' Four Panther freshmen will also make the trip
to Rutgers to participate in the
440-yard freshman relay. The
four frosh who won the right to
swim because of their ﬁne trial
times this year, are Tom Wieg-
man, Willis Weis, Don Weber, and
Lou Durbin. This aggregation is
thought to be the strongest the

Easterns in recent years and is
expected to place very high.

Wrestlers’ Favored  

  To Gain 2nd Straight

 

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Bent on retaining the Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Association title that they won for the
ﬁrst time last year, Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers
open defense of the crown that is symbolic of
wrestling supremacy in the East against 16 mem-
ber schools today and tomorrow at State College,
Pa.

The two-day extravaganza will ﬁnd 128 par-
cipants going after the eight championships—among
them being the charges from Skyscraper U. who
are determined to hold the coveted trophy.

Three returning champions from the 16 schools
are back to defend their titles. They are Ed Rooney
of Syracuse in the 157—pound division, footballer

Joe Gattuso of Navy in the 167-pound class, and _

Pete Blair of the same school'in the heavyweight
ranks. S

Observers closed to the Atlantic seaboard have
tabbed the Middies as the team to take top honors,

' with Pitt, Lehigh, and’Penn'State in close pursuits.

In winning the crown last year, the’Pe'erymen
captured three ﬁrsts, two seconds, and a third.
Of these ﬁve wrestlers though, only the two who
took seconds are on this year’s squad. Departed

from the scene are Hugh Peery (123), Charley

Uram (147),‘and George Beresford (177).
Although there has been a signiﬁcant shakeup
in squad personnel from last year, Panther mat
mentor Rex Peery is confident that his boys will
upset the dopesheet by taking it all. i
“Everyone .will be after us this year,” com-

. mented Peery. “It’s’going to be tough and if we

are going to win ‘we will have to pickup fall
points in the ﬁrst two rounds to provide a cushion
when the ﬁnal points are totaled,” he continued.
Judging fromlpast experiences, the Jungle Cats
don’t anticipate any referee’s decisions going in
their favor. Thus,_ they will have to be at least

one point ahead at the «ﬁnal buzzer if they hope

(Continued on. Page 7)

  
 

‘Panthers’

a very outstanding job and de-
serve a lot of c1~edit,” he added.

One thingthat may derail the
bid a for their fourth
straight title is their lack of depth.
They will have only an eight-man
squad at the Easterns whereas
most of the opposing teams will
have twelve or fifteen men.
Thus, even though they have a
ﬁrst-rate collection of swimmers
capable of winning more than
their share of ﬁrsts, they don’t
have enough. ‘depth to take the
second and third places which
pay off in valuable points.

Winter I Sports
In Unique Baffle

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

 

‘Records are usually set in sports when competing against
the best competition. In other words, when athletes are
pressed, they seem to come up with record-shattering per-
formances as compared to doing the same with easy op-
ponents. — ~ _

This weekend, though, Pitt’s double -barreled winter
sports kings, wrestling and swimming,‘ have even more than
strong foes to beat—they have each other to beat.

As Swim Coach Ben Grady said at last year’s‘East-
erns, “every time the boys heard over the public address
system that a Pitt wrestler had won or placed high, they
tried even harder.” -

And, this same event is taking place today and tomorrow.
Both squads know they have good chance of repeating as
Eastern champs but they can- '
not falter since the other team
will show them up.

To the Panther sports en-
thusiast, this is about the best
thing that could happen. Here
are swimmers and wrestlers
ﬁghting not only the Eastern
opponents but each other in an
attempt to maintain their M  ,_ _
place. Some could argue that ra y P ery
Pitt sports_ squads should not be in competition with other
but this is not really the case. Actually, I’m sure bothiare

.pulling'for each other, but,they’re pulling for themselves,

ﬁrst.

- Tribute forthe success of these two squads must go
to their coaches. Ben Grady led the Panthers to an un-
precedented third straight championship last year and
now is on the verge of extending Pitt’s supremacy to four.
And, all this without a regular pool to practice in,
scholastic difficulties that knocked off two important
men, and the graduation loss of four outstanding swim-
mers.

Rex Peery, also, has done a tremendous job. In six years,
the Panthers have risen from obscurity to second in the na-
tion, joined the Eastern Collegiate Wrestling Association,
and boosted Pitt’s name exceedingly.

Both Grady and Peery were champs when they were
undergraduates. It’s no wonder they won’t take second for
an answer from their disciples. It’s wonderful to be at the
top, and once you get used to it, the thrill doesn’t wear off.

Points are distributed on _a
6-4-2-1 basis with an. additional
point being rewarded for eachfall
that is scored.

Taking into, consideration -the
personnel and caliber of opposi-
tion that each team has been
faced with, local observers voice
the opinion that the Panthers will
take all the marbles with Penn
State, Lehigh, Navy, and Rutgers
following. . .

The Blue and Gold’s main
threats are the undefeated trio of
Ed Peery (130), Ed DeWitt (167),

Joe Gatusso of Navy last year.
DeWitt, a junior, and Solomon,
a senior, are the two most experi-
enced wrestlers on this year’s
squad. Bob Cook (147), probably
the most underrated member of
the locals, was selected as team
captain for the tournament
skirmishes. The honor of most
valuable player in dual meets
went to Solomon, who also receiv-
ed the award in his freshman year.
Don Huff (1157), also a senior,
has a 6-3-1 record, but has not
had as much varsity experience as

Sam Berry, ace shot-putter of

lost by a fall.. ’

Berry, wrestlingpin the heavy-

period in the ﬁrst event of the
evening.

Fred Liebler then copped the

Plaids’ Ed Piatnik at-1:37 of the
second period. George Liebler, in
the 137-pound class, decisioned
Tech’s John Birkenkamp, 9-2,’ for
Pitt’s last victory.

'WHA'I"S THIS? For solution see
paragraph below. Droodle suggested

by Robert Bardole, University of Florida:

 

ENJOY vounszir to the hilt whenever you smoke.
Simply light up at. Lucky and get Luckies’ famous bet-
ter taste. Luckies taste better for good reasons. First
of all, Lucky Strike means ﬁne‘ tobacco. Then, that
tobacco  _tg_a_s_t__e_c_i to taste better. 5.‘It’s Toasted”—the
famous Lucky Strike process—-tones up Luckies’ light,
mild, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better.
Now for the Droodle above, titled: Better-tasting
Lucky smoke puffed by modern sculptor. Make a-
monumental discovery. Next time you buy cigarettes,
try the better- tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
