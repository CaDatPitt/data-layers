It is becoming increasingly popular

for American colleges to have mis-

The University of Pittsburgh in

it has been one of the pioneers in
this line.

The students of the University will

NEXT REVIEW T0
FEATURE smmts
  at PITTSBURGH

Called William J ohnstonshort
Story Number After Do-
nator of $100 Prize—Ma-

terial Must be Submitted.

Before May 1

In honoriof William Johnston, '91,
donator of a $100 prize for the’ best

short story submitted to The Pitt Re-
view by a student during the college
year, the next issue of The Review

iwill be known as the William Johns-
'ton Short Story Number, and will be

devoted almost entirely to new stories
submitted for the prize. All material
for the issue must be in the hands of
the editors before Saturday. May 1.

Attention of contestants is called to
the two rules of the contest: First.
all stories must have Pittsburgh lo
cales; and second, they must not be
words in length. Three Pittsburgh
writers an d critics-——J. O'Connor.
Charles Bregg and Anna R. Stratton--
will be the judges.

The editors are anxious that the
stories presented to the judges be
representative of the true literary
ability of the student body and, there-
fore, urge that every student, wheth-
er senior, junior. sophomore or fresh-
man, try for the prize. Story con-
tributors, thus far, have been entirely
too few, and the majority of these, the
editors say. have not put suﬂicient
stress on Pittsburgh locales.

Contributions can be submitted to
any of the editors or addressed to The
Pitt Review, State Hall, University of
Pittsburgh. All material should be
more than 5,000 nor less than 1,000
typewritten and double-spaced.

Til BE IIIISERVEII MAY I

The tenth anniversary of the School
oi Economics is going to be celebrated
on the evening of May 1 by a smoker,

which promises to be a real hummer.
It is the tlrst birthday party the
school has ever held. and the sched-
ule calls for a real celebration. Com-
mittees of alumni and students are on
the job lining up a top-notch program,
and there is going to be a real turn-
out ot the alumni as well as the under-
graduates. During the present week
announcement is being sent to all for-
mer Economics men on the alumni
records, urging him to send in his
ticket order early. The alumni sale
is being handled by John C. “I-ieavy"
Fryor. Ec. '18. from the alumni oilice.
Commonwealth building.

The program sounds as though there
will be something doing all evening.
A battle royal is promised, and this in
itself is enough to bring out the boys.
It is being engineered by C. D. "Red”
Delphey, Ex. '19, a veteran in this
held. and there is no question but that
the fracas will be full of action, with
Red acting as master of éeremonies.
Another item on the program, which
always attracts, is the appearance of
Zara Yardam, who will sing. play on
one of the half dozen instruments of
which he is master. and otherwise en-
tertain. Dick Lang promises to ut
on a line of chatter better than is
Cap and Gown show stuff; while Dick
Love has undertaken to present, not
only a jazz orchestra of exceedingly
great quality. pep and volume. but an
equally jazzy quartet. vocal, all picked
from the School of Economics. And,
in addition, Kockey Macbeod, chair-
man of the Entertainment Committee.
promisesacouple of surprise features
that will long be remembered.

Schramm, '18. has arranged for
kinds and
enough eats to satisfy even the most
ravenous freshman. The smoker will
he held in the "Y" hut. which is be-
coming an extremely popular gather-
ing place, and “Pal" Moore has as-
sured the volunteer board of mana-
gers that the place is all theirs. and
that the boys can tear it apart that
night if they want to—provided they
put it back together again.

Tickets for the smoker will be
placed on sale in a few days by a big
student committee. headed by J. B.
Nicholas. while alumni can secure
theirs from Fryor at the alumni head-
quarters.

SBUIIIERN BASEBALL .IAUNT

 

All eyes are turned to the Balmy
South. As at the old Lexington Derby,
we announce that “They're off!" They

' _ are off to conquer strange ﬁelds. The
. Pitt baseball team leave for Athens,

Ga... tonight, where they will meet the
University of Georgia on Friday and
Saturday of this week.

Outside of nothing the games with
Pitt will be the banner events of the
South this year. The Pitt aggregation
has been given a great deal of pub-
licity below the Mason and Dixon line.
and word from the Georgians indi-
cates that a crowd of about 15,000
fans will be in attendance to witness
the scalping of someone. Although
the'Athenians have been training and
chasing .the horsehide for some time,
and have developed a formidable com-
bination they are not by any means
underestimating the ability of the
Panthers. The Blue and Gold boys,
on the other hand, know well enough
the ability of the Southerners and are
fully aware of their own seeming un-
preparedness, but Coach Harley is not
going to let a little thing like that
bother him. He is optimistic, and, so
are.we. We know the coach and re-
member how he turned losing combin-
ations into top-notchcrs up at State.
It will be remembered that a. few
years ago, in a game with Pitt, he
sent an outﬁelder to pitch against us
for State and, sure enough, the game
was won by the Mt. Nittany lads.
That's Coach Harley for you.

The party leaving tonight will con-

. sist of 13 players and the coachand

Managed Toomey. Ike Bloom is in
ﬁne shape for the mound, and he is
the probable selection to oppose the
Southerners. Max Sapper will catch
his curves and with this bagery we
are looking for fur to ﬂy.

The balance of the team is still a
mystery. Coach Harley states that he
will keep this a secret until the very
last minute. No man, therefore, is
sure of a berth, and it is likely that
some dark horse will break in at the
last ‘moment. The men who have
shown up most favorably in the prac-
tices are Bloom, McBeth and Barrett
for the hurlers’ job. Robinson and
Fleck will probably have charge of

. the ﬁrst bag and Brady at second.

Tom Davies is showing well at short.
Ryman and Jones are the chief con-
tenders for the thirdsack. The most
formidable outﬁeldeis are Curran,
Daniels and Brown. These men have
shown the most promise. but any one
of the several others is likely to
‘change the coach's mind when the
time comes to leave.

There is plenty of hitting material
on the squad, and we are anxiously
awaiting the box score to see how
many home runs are registered
against the Athenians. The outﬁeld-
er.s are all of a high caliber, and the
inﬁeld cannot be beaten. The Pitt in-
ﬁeld would make a race for any major
league team right now. The greatest
difﬁculty encountered, so far, has been
with the pill ﬂingers, but it is well
known that Harley is quite able to de-

velop a wonderful pitcher. He in-
tends to have his fﬂend, “Babe”
Adams, up on the Hill after the

Pirates come home, to assist him in
coaching the pitchers and, believe us,
brother, if Harley, Adams & Company
can't produce a good hurler, no one
on earth ever can. Coach Harley has
always made the most of the material
at hand and, time and again, he has
turned a sure defeat into a whirling
victory by his brainy coaching and re-
arrangement of his players. He is
here for" business, and says that we
are going to beat State and others of
our most bitter foes, and we believe it.

IIERBERT IIBIIVER IILUB
Tll BE BRRANIZEII
AT UNIVERSITY

About 150 men attended the initial
meeting of the Hoover ‘Club. last Fri-
day at noon in the “Y” hut. Dr.
Charles Reitell, of the Economics de-
partment and Dr. Tyson of the socio-
logical department were the principal
speakers. ‘

Dr. Reitell emphasized the impor-
tance of a man who expects to be our
next president ‘being well versed in
international questions, the industrial
unrest between capital and labor and
the reorganization of federal ﬁnances,
particularly the ‘budget system. He
showed that Hoover has had speciﬁc
training in all these matters. Dr.
Tyson stressed the ra-pid growth of
Hoover Clubs in prominent universi-
ties throughout the East and West. Dr.
Tyson demonstrated the importance
of organizing such a club at Pitt for
educational campaign among the stu-
dent body in order to shape political
opinion of men and women in whose
hands future political situations rest.
Dr. Tyson predicted that the women
would have a vote by the next presi-
dential election and that therefore the
co-eds -should become interested and
come out for the next meeting, which
will be held in the near future. At
this time plans for permanent organ-
ization of the club will be discussed.

A meeting of the organization,
called The Hoover Club, will be held
next Friday at 12:30 in the Turn-
verein. All the students of the Uni-
versity are urged to come. Co-eds are
invited to attend. .

Dr. Rosewell Johnson of the Oil and
Gas Department of the University will
be the principal speaker of the meet-
ing. J. B. Nicklas of the employment
agency will be acting chairman.

Similar clubs have been organized
at many other universities, including
the University of Pennsylvania, Wil-
liams College and other leading in-
stitutions throughout the East and
West.

SPEAKERS lAllll Wllllll
BE llll. IIIIASHEAII
AT ASSEMBLY

At the memorial services conducted
in honor of Dr. John Alfred Brashear,
former chancellor of the University,
at the Memorial Hall last Wednesday,
Dr. Samuel B. McCormick, present
chancellor, lauded the memory of
their former friends and co-worker.

G. M. P. Baird, a graduate and for-
mer professor of English at the Uni-
versity read his poem “The Tribute
of Life,” which he dedicated to Dr.
Brashear in commemoration of the
scientist's seventy-ﬁfth anniversary.

Dr. Holland reviewed '‘Uncle’’ John's
career from the standpoint of his ac-
complishments as a mechanic.

He said in part: “In the loss of
John Brashear, Pittsburgh and the
world at large have lost one of the
most skillful mechanics of all times.
In his career can be seen the expon-
ent of practical knowledge as against
that of theoretical knowledge. “Uncle"
John had a kind heart and was a rep-
resentative of American ingenuity and
mechanical skill.”

Chancellor McCormick related the
services that Dr. Brashear rendered
while connected with the University.
“The greatest lesson we can take
from the life of Brashear,” said the
chancellor, "is that there is no situa-
tion for discouragement. When a
thing is the hardest, then is the oppor-
tunity to accomplish most. Pitts-
burgh is better, greater and ﬁner be-
cause of John Alfred Brashear. We
honored, -loved, the service. which he

PENN RELAY TRIALS

. EBEBBMAN TEAM BBMIMB SlllllNli 7 vv

 

THIS WEEII;

Less than two weeks are left before
the Penn Relays, April 30-May 1. The
preliminary trials are scheduled for
this week and the ﬁn_als will be run
about Tuesday of next week. Just
how the preliminaries will be run has
not been deﬁnitely announced. It is
generally assumed that Shea will be
qualiﬁed without running the trial. A
dozen or more are expected to try
out.

There are two more men who are to
be seriously considered for the relay.
They are Ted Manderville and Karl
Swope. Ted Manderville has been im-
proving wonderfully this year, and
should be one of the University's
strongest half-milers. It was his run-
ning in the fraternity relay that was
largely responsible for the Sigma Kap-
pa Pi victory. He will make a strong
bid this year for the relay team, for he
has enough speed for a quarter-miler.

‘Karl Swope, though he has never
competed for the University. has had
considerable track experience. Two
years ago at Schenley High he was
the best man in the city in the sprints.
He has been working out daily the
past week and, if he is able to get in
shape in time, will be a strong con-
tender for the relay.‘

Last Saturday afternoon Harry
Martin ran the fastest quarter of the
year on the indoor track. Shea, though
he has not run a quarter against the

speed.

The rainy weather has interfered
materially with the out-door practice
so far, but the men have been work-
ing faithfully in the indoor track. As
soon as the team gets outdoors regu-
larly Manager Harry Gow will work
out a schedule for the freshmen ap-
prentice managers, days on which they
are to report at the track. There are
about 10 freshmengout for apprentice
managerships. Director Miller has
made it plain that the biggest ‘job for
the apprentice managers right now is
to scout around among the freshmen
and get men out for track, who have
had track experience. or who would
seem to have the makings of varsity
track men in the future.

Assistant Manager Prigg is still
working on a freshman schedule, but
he is not yet ready to make any an-
nouncement. However, quite a few
freshmen are working out daily and
Coach Kerr seems to have the nucleus

At the Athletic Council meeting on
Wednesday, April 14, action was taken
granting gold footballs to Dre. C. V.

ball men must win their letters for.
three years in order to get these foot-

balls. The Allhouse boys were en-

however, playing on the '16 Freshman 

football team, and winning their let-

The)’ were unable, therefore, to play
the three years at varsity, as the‘-

The Dental School is now a four‘-

now Mr unnu-

About next Saturday my
third tailoring store will
be open and doing busi-

ncss.
It is at 6221 Frankstown
Avenue, right at Penn

Avenue, convenient for my
many customers in the"
East End district.

When I announced
about a year ago that I was
prepared to make clothes
to order at about half other
high grade tailors’ prices,
there were p 1 e n t y of
Doubting.Thomases‘. But
one by one the disbelievers
have come into camp.

First, one store; then
two—and now three. The
largest high grade tailor-
ing business in Pittsburgh
growing still larger.

That shows the. conﬁ-
dence of my customers. If
I wasn’t giving satisfac-
tion —- if my suits and
prices weren’t all that I
say for them, I would be
slipping backward instead
of doubling and tripling
my capacity.
