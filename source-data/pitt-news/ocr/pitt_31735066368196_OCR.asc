Guitarist to Perform at Pitt  

By JILL SAVITZ

The intricate and ever-
changing music of the Spanish
gypsies will be heard when fla-
menco guitarist Carlos Mon-
toya plays at Carnegie Music
Hall at 8 p.m. on Thursday,
Nov. 18.

Montoya, who has been play-
ing for 70 years, was the first
flamenco guitarist to play solo
instead of with a singer or
dancer. He has been giving solo
concerts for over 30 years, but
his interest in flamenco music
goes beyond giving concerts.

In 1966, the first flamenco
piece to be written for an
orchestra was played by the St.
Louis Symphony. Written by
Montoya, Suite Flamenco is the
only such flamenco work in
existence. It has since been
played by many orchestras,
including
Symphony.

One of the reasons it is so dif-
ficult for flamenco music to be
played by an orchestra is thatit

is largely improvisational.
Although the same pieces may
appear on Montoyas programs
over and over again, they sound
different each time.

“As he's sitting there on
stage, getting the response from
the audience. things occure to
him," said his wife, Sally Mon-
toya, in a phone interview.

Although Montoya received
some training from other fla-
menco guitarists, he learned
most of what he knows today
simply by playing. Music
schools don’t teach this_style of
playing, but, according to Mon-
toya's wife, he is “glad he didn't
have music lessons because he’s
highly individualistic.”

A Since he received no formal
training, he does. not read
music. His wife'a’oesn't believe
this is a problem; reading music
might cause him to lose his
spontaneity.

Montoya taught many years
ago, but according to his wife,
“he is not the world’s best

teacher. Also, after
learned the basics, you don’t
want to copy anyone’s style.
After a certain point, people
have to create their own music."

In the respect that each artist
brings his background, train-
ing and style to flamenco
music, it is more comparable to
jazz than to classical music,
contrary to the beliefs of most
people.

Although Montoya has
recorded over  albums, he
spends most of his time playing
concerts. “He feels that com-
municating with people with
his music gives him the most
joy," his wife said. “He plays a
great many colleges because the
interest is there.”

The Montoyas recently
returned from the West Coast,
where Montoya played 14 con-
certs in 19 days.

Montoya is 78, but, according
to his wife, he hasn't considered
retiring. “He has no reason to
reture because he does what he
likes most and gets paid for it.”

and there is a failure to recognize
this.

There is a tendency of many of
the people who plan foreign policy
to work from preconceived notions
about other peoples.

“I think that people who work
from stereotypes are a little crazy,”
Cottam said.

“If you look at the areas of

By MARTI COMMAN DAROS

Today’s ongoing debate
about nuclear war and its con-
sequences has confused,
alarmed and frightened most of
society. The thought of a possi-
ble nuclear confrontation has
scared some into paralysis, oth-
ers into denial. Many have
evaded the issue totally. There
is, however, one woman who
has hope for the future.

Native Pittsburger Molly
Rush said she thinks that there
can be hope in the nuclear
society in which we live. She
said she lives with that hope
everyday.

Rush is best known for an
incident during September
1980. She and seven other peace
activists walked into a classified
area of the General Electric
Space Division in King of Prus-
sia, Pa., and smashed two Mark
12-A warhead casings and
poured blood on tools and doc-
uments.

She said that act was not one
of desperation, but rather,
hope.

“Hope is seeing something
beyond the reality that you

see,” Rush said. “Hope begins
with one’s deepest sense of life;
one’s deepest sense of love or
religion.”

Before her birth of hope,
Rush said she had to overcome

within herself in response to
the world around her.

“It has been a century of de-
spair," she said, citing World
War II, the Cold War and the
explosion of the first atomic
bomb. “I wonder how I grew
up with hope for the future.”

Rush said most people
believe that progress and new
technologies could make it pos-
sible for things to get better,
and the revolution of the Civil
Rights Movement. brought
more hope to the country for
survival.

“In the ‘60s, the Vietnam
War changed all this,” Rush
said. “ In the ‘70s with the
death of Martin Luther King,
the Civil Rights Movement
began to fade and the harsh
realities became apparent."

The enviromental movement
was a sign of hope, according to
Rush, because it brought about
a “level of consciousness and
people took a progressive view
of the environment.”

At the same time the new
awareness of the environment
was awakening, there was little
awareness of the nuclear arms
situation.

Alerting citizens about the
nuclear arms situation, Rush
said, is “like walking a
tightrope—-arousing people’s
fears to make them conscious of
it, yet not scaring them into

Although there are many
people who live day by day with
a consciousness of the nuclear
arms situation, Rush said she
talks about a different level of
consciousness—one that
should connect with the deep-
est part of a persons being.

Rush said from that form of

  

consciousness, a person’s belie .
system is established, and it 15"”

those beliefs by which one must
live.

“To live according to a belief
system entails a couple of
things,” Rush said, “including
getting beyond  military sys-
tem that tells me there’s no
hope because it puts so much of
life’s blood into military build-
up and trying to come up with a
different possibility...a little
closer to the truthiof life.”

Rush said her belief system,-e_,._,

has not faltered because of her
uncertain future or the two to
five-year jail sentence she must
serve for the incident at the
General Electric plant.

In fact, Rush said, she feels
more whole today because of
that incident.

“The difference in my life
now is that my belief system
and my life connect,” she said.

She also said she would
always be willing to go non-

 

violently for her cause as

Opinion

F

Looking Back,
Objectively  

Today our nation reflects on the career of
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. In recalling his
career, we highlight Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan and martial law in Poland, and we

tend to neglect nuances in~Soviet behavior.

It seems that we as a nation are guilty of
historic subjectivity. If we wish to continue to
coexist with the Soviet Union, we need to
remember that they are not always “bad guys.”
There have been times when the United States
has donned the black hats, as well.

Take, for example, the events which sur-
rounded the opening of the first Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT I) summit in May,
1972. In early April of that year, the North
Vietnamese had launched a major offensive
against the South, and in response, President
Richard Nixon prepared to bomb Hanoi and
the port of Haiphong.

Thus, with the SALT summit rapidly
approaching, the U.S. was planning‘ to bomb
an ally of the Soviet Union, in apparent disre-
gard of a possible Soviet reaction. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger has noted, “the fact
remains that I, the Soviet expert on my staff, as
well as the CIA and the State Department, all
expected the Soviets to cancel the summit.”

If President Reagan is looking for an
approach in future dealings with a new Soviet
leadership, he must re-examine the past. He
must understand the totality of past Soviet
behavior, not just selected parts of it. Unfortu-
nately, one would think that we have forgotten
all Soviet actions prior to their move into
Afghanistan.

In dealing with the Soviet Union, we must
look at the whole story. If our leaders desire to
bring out the best in Soviet behavior, they must
reject selective readings of history. Such selec-
tivity will at best create self-fulfilling
prophecies.

If President Reagan wishes to neglect the
past, his idea of an ever-aggressive Soviet Union
may become a reality. That reality is precisely
the one wejhope to avoid.

SG B: Some SecondThoughts

By RON BARBER

The surprising outcome of the
recent Student Government Board
(SGB) election demands some re-
evaluation of our understanding of
this process. Some of the conclu-
sions I have previously drawn
about student government election
politics are strengthened and oth-
ers seriously weakened by the
results of this year’s voting.

First, we cannot fail to affirm
that issues (or, if you prefer, prob-
lems or goals that students would
like SGB to address) do not signifi-
cantly affect voting in the SGB
races. How are we to choose from

among 23 candidates on the basis ,

of their public statements when the
statements of each are nearly
identical?

Second, we must recognize that a
student group’s endorsement of a
candidate is not influential simply
because it is made and announced.
The relative strength or weakness
of an endorsement is undoubedly
explained by the actions a group
takes to make the endorsement
influential. For instance, in the
1981 campaign the Engineering
Student Cabinet (ESC) used its

Election

l)ear liditorz

()n Wednesday, Nov. 2, an irres-
ponsible act was committed of
which the majority of Pitt students
are probably completely unaware.
As a result of negligence, a Pitt stu-
dent running for Student Govern-

ment Board (SGB), Arpi
Asdourian, was an unfortunate
victim.

The SGB elections were taking
place that afternoon and during
this time a polling place in Hill-
man Library was left unattended
for about l0 minutes. A student
stole about 20 ballots from the
unattended voting area and
Asdourian was charged with
knowledge of the event and posses-
sion of the ballots.

This account declaring Asdour-
ian's guilt, as reported in The Pitt
.\’ezv.s‘, was erroneous and totally

unfounded. Her innocence of the

affair was eventually proved.

llie guilty party, of whom
.-\sdourian was only an acquain-
tance, admitted to the entire affair
and returned all of the stolen bal-
lots. This is a'\‘ery important point:
none of these ballots were evercast,
all were returned.

.\ftei the occurrence on \\'t-dues-
day. .~\sdoutian was pressured by
iiiaiiy to resign. She was told that if
she went ahead with hearings
iiivolving the Election Board and
_llI(lI(‘I2Il Board to investigate the

own resources to encourage engi-
neering students to vote for ESC-
endorsed candidates. As a result,
their endorsements showed quite
an effect on the outcome of the elec-
tion, as I have previously described.
This year, however, it seems that

“A student group’s
endorsement is not
influential simply
because it is made and
.announcedf’

some dissenting voices at Benedum
Hall weakened the ESC endorse-
ment. Endorsements are not magic
political “power pills,” rather they
are only as strong as the observable
efforts of their respective groups to
make them strong.

Third, the continued success of
Delta Tau" Delta fraternity
members in capturing the SG.B
presidency reflects the importance
of effort to a successful candidacy.
Students who are considering
entering the next SGB presidential
race would do well to learn about
advanced planning and organiza-
tion from Delta Tau Delta.

The final point is one'l am reluc-
tant to make, for I, too, am dis-

‘Occurrence’

incident it would unfairly delay the
election results for several weeks.
The SGB wanted to guard its credi-
bility and not make a big issue of
the affair.

It is very disturbing that theSGB
would be more interested in sweep-
ing an incident under the rug, so to
speak, than in actually seeingjus-
tice done in air innocent student’s
name.

This apathy towards justice on
the part of the SGB leads to the
fundamental point of the problem.
It was the negligence on the part of

turbed by the extravagant
postering practices of the candi-
dates. Nonetheless, a candidate
cannot ignore the importance’ of
hanging a lot of posters through-
out the campaign. In addition, and
contrary to the belief of some past
candidates, I would suggest that it
is more important to start posting
from the first official day of’cam-



paigning than to save posters for a",

“last minute push.”

I have not intended that this
column, of which this is the final
installment, should be of a criti-
cism of any of the groups or indi-
viduals I have mentioned. It is the
system itself which stands in need
of improvement, and without such
improvement it would be senseless
to criticize anyone involved for
playing the game to win, or anyone
not involved for not bothering to
vote. Further, I have not meant to
suggest that my 1981 campaign
was in any way “better” than any
others’. In fact, given that I lost the
election, I would have to conclude
that mine was somehow “worse.” I
only hope that my comments may
have led someone—anyone-to
think about the SGB election pro-
cess. After all, it is your SGB.

Explained

the SGB, i.e., leaving the polling
station unattended, which resulted
in the stealing of the ballots.

This carelessness dtiring an elec-
tion is inexcusable.

If anything good can be gained
from theexperience, it is that we
may learn from it and insure that it
may never occur again.

One final point: Don't we, the
voters, have the right to know if
Asdourian would have been a
member of the next SGB?

Childish
Outbursts

Dear Editor:

As secretary for The Pitt
News, I get the opportunity to
read most of the letters to the
3 editor before publication,
including the ones that are
unfit to publish because ofabt1-
sive or offensive language.

I think it’s sad that the major-
ity of letters that come to The
Pitt News office are nothing
more than childish outbursts
and immature reasoning. It is
the journalist’s responsibility
to report the news in a profes-
sional, efficient and factual
manner, and it’s the reader’s
right to alert the writer to any
fallacious information that
might appear or to, make a
general comment on any given
I subject.

I don’t think that a letter to
the editor should be an excuse
to attack the columnist’s per-
sonality, intellectual capacity
or sexual habits. It is fine to
attack an article’s authenticity
or to challenge its credibility,

but the assault should be
limite(l to the topic, not the
author.

Managing editor Christina
Clinton has been accused of
using The Pitt News to air her
personal gripes. It seems that
many of the readers who
respond to her columns are
guilty of the very same thing.

Very few letters to the editor
? ever get around to supporting
or. rejecting a specific idea; they
usually focus the issue on mak-
ing defamatory comments
about the columnist’s personal
and private life. Althought I
will not defend Chris Clinton
or her journalistic style (that is
not the issue), I will defend her
(or any other writer’s) right to
freedom from slander or per-
sonal harassment.

I think it.’s time the readers
start treating The Pitt News as a
newspaper and not a malicious
gossip column.

Socrates Sentenced To ‘Burger Death’

By STEVE PARKS

This week: Freud has gotten
Socrates out of jail.

“Free at last! Free at last!"
Socrates shouts as he leaves his cell.
“Thanks a lot, Freud, real nice of
ya!”

“Come on, let’s get something to
eat,” Freud said, heading to his car.

“Where we going?"

“One of those fast food places.”

“Fast food?” asked Socrates.

“They’re restaurants that claim
to give you good food, and you’re
supposed to get in and out real
quick—an‘ obvious sexual
reference.”

“Definitely,” replied Socrates,
dusting off his new toga made from
prison bed sheets. After a while, the
Volkswagon came to a halt outside
“Burger Death," and both men got
out of the car. Heading down the
ramp that leads into the restaurant,
Freud said, “Let me do the
talking."

“Why?”

“Stop asking questions.”

“Why?” persisted Socrates.

“Dogyou want to go back tojail?"
snapped Freud, getting in back of
the line.

“This isn’t good for my toga,"
concluded Socrates, picking it up
past his knees to avoid dragging it
through the crushed french fries
and spilled pop.

“Stop complaining. What do
you want to eat?"

“What do they have to eat?”
asked Socrates.

“Again with the questions,”
whined Freud. “Read the sign.”

Socrates stared intently at the
greasy sign and finally decided oil a
“Big Death.” Freud paid the bill
and they headed for a booth.

“How's the food?" Freud
inquired.

“Terrible. They must be here for
some reason other than the one you
told me! I think I’ll find the real
reason!”

“You’re wasting your time.’

“Nevertheless...”

“Look, don’t embarrass me,”
Freud pleaded. “Hey, come back
here," he said, grabbing for
Socrates’ toga. It was too late,

Socrates was already at the counter.

“Excuse me," he asked, “I was
wondering, why are you really
here?” _

“Why, we’re here because we
believe that people should get a
good meal at a fair price!"

“But what factors are involved in
a good meal?" asked Socrates.

“Oh, there’s good service, nice
atmosphere and, of course, good
food!" '

“Do you have good service?"
Socrates asked.

“Of course."

“Well, I had to stand in line fora
half hour, and the counter girl
called me “grody."

“Well....”

“What about
phere?”

“()ur restaurant is spotless,” he
stated confidently.

. “Well. my table andmany others
have food all over them. To be
blunt, they’re disgusting.”

“Look, what’s your problem?"
the manager said, squeezing out of
his chair to stand up.

“I just want to know why you’re

a nice atmos-

here?"

“I told you, to provide a good
meal!” he shouted, causing all in
the restaurant to stare at him.

“Do you call this good?" asked
Socrates displaying a tiny ham-
burger on a huge stale bun, with
hardened cheese encasing the sides.

“Get lost, freak!" the manager
said, pushing Socrates with his fin-
ger. Freud, seeing what was hap-
pening, pushed his way through
the crowd of onlookers and rescued
Socrates.

“I asked you not to cause a

scene," Freud said in a motherly ,

tone once they were back in the car.

“He wouldn’t answer my ques-
tion," Socrates explained.

“Still.”

“You weren’t a lot of help!”
Socrates commented.

“I was observing,” Freud
explained. “Notice how he licked
his fingers?”

“What does that mean?”

“Means he didn’t wash his
hands!”

“Oh," said Socrates. The ride

continued in silence.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.——]ulie
Gaul, captain of the Lady Panther
volleyball team and MVP at the Big
East Championships, walked off
the court yesterday after the team’s
match against Georgetown and
said in a relieved voice, “At least
our careers are not over yet.”

Indeed, the Lady Panthers
volleyball “machine,” as directed
by Coach Shelton Collier, rolled
over its opposition this weekend at
Providence College, where seven
other teams vied for the coveted Big
East championship.

Before the Lady Panthers faced
Seton Hall Friday and until out-
side hitter Pat Belcher served the
final point against Georgetown,
Pitt never admitted to the fear of
losing a match, let alone a game.

Eyeing Up The Big East

By MARK A. SINDLER

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Notes,
quotes and anecdotes on the Big
East volleyball championships.
The weekend conference cham-
pionships were a first for women’s
sports in the four-year old Big East.
After the NCAA gathered women’s
sports under its umbrella last year,
the Big East incorporated seven of
those sports.

Conference representative at
Providence Diane Turner sees
women's sports, especially volley-
ball, headed in the right direction.

“Tournaments such as this
strengthen competition and give
the teams something to play for,"
she said. “Schools can also recruit
better, and players will want to
play better.”

She further said that many teams
are changing over from the Ameri-
can Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) organization
(now folded) to the NCAA regula-
tions. Incentives for switching
include payment of books, which
was unallowable under AIAW
rules.

Turner said, “The NCAA also
allows for bringing champion-

ships about in a more professional
way and just offers the possibility
for more benefits.”

0 One coach who has consis-
tency down to a science is George-
town's Dr. Joe McClure. In his
ninth year, he has yet to experience
a losing season. His previous “$400
a year” jog as volleyball coach was
made easier in l975 when
“women's scholarsh_ips made all
the difference.

“’I'm still in a, little academic
world,", McClure said. “There are
only about 5,700 students where

Tough Foes Sink Swimmers

By SCOTT DELLETT

Having a reputation of being
one of the best in the nation helps a
swimming team, especially at
recruiting time. But sometimes
having this label brings out the
best of the competition. This hap-
pened last weekend to the Pitt Lady
Panther swim team as it lost dual-
meets to Syracuse and Tennessee
81-68, 89-60, respectively.

According to Coach Dave Belo-
wich, the times by both teams were
among their best in dual-meet
competition. I

“Syracuse swam well,” Belowich
said. “They tapered, shaved and
wore skin suits for us. Their season
was this meet. It should be interest-
ing to see how they do against us in

‘ the Big East championships.”

McCall, Brooks Lead Panthers

By BRIAN BALK

WEST POINT, N.Y. — They
pride themselves on depth, from
linebacker to split end. The
reserves are almost as good as the
starters.

Meet Pitt back ups-turned star-
ters joe McCall and Michael
Brooks. Saturday, against a stub-
born Army team, McCall, a tail-
back-fullback and Brooks, a defen-
sive end, resembled anything but
second string players.

McCall and Brooks began the
season watching from the Pitt side-
lines. Brooks, a junior college
transfer, backed Michael Woods.
McCall spent three years on a rol-
lercoaster, sometimes playing well
but never really living. up to the
standards he set in high school.

Saturday, for perhaps the first
time, the light shone on Brooks

arid-Mc(la.ll..I*k>r.Mc(lall-, it was the - ~

“Tennessee swam against
Bowling Green the day before they
faced us, and their times weremuch
better than against Bowling
Green," he added.

“In the 10 meets I’ve coached
here, five teams have shaved and
rested_for us. It’s a compliment to
the program,” he said.

Despite the dismal results over
the weekend, Belowich saw several
things that pleased him. One was

the performance of-junior Sue.

Heon.

Heon won all six events she
entered this weekend and set a new
school record in the 200-yard back-
stroke with a time of2:08.44, break-
ing her 1980 record by four-tenths
of a second.

“When Sue set the record, she
was in a championship meet, and

first time he has rushed for over 100
yards in a Pitt uniform. For
Brooks, it was a day in which he
would make his first interception
for the Panthers.

McCall ran for 129 yards, a figure
which could have been considera-
bly higher had Army not stacked
the defense against the big play.

“They played six defensive
backs," McCall explained after-
ward. “That type of defense dis-
poses of any chances of breaking
through the secondary."

Evidence: Mc(Iall didn't have
any spectacular runs. He plugged
away for short yardage and, in the
process, took a heating from the
Army defense.

While i\‘Ic(lall rubbed the
wounds, Brooks glearned, reflect-
ing back on his interception.

"I just came out, and the tight-

.end released. up. the field," .Br'ooks

she was well-rested,” Belowich
said. “I’m encouraged on what
she’ll do this season.” '
Laura Barber was another
swimmer who had a good week-
end. The sophomore backstroke
specialist won the 100- and 200-
yard backstroke on Friday and was
forced into duty in an unfamiliar

‘event — the 200 individual medley.

The Lady Panthers had to take at
least a first and a third on Friday in
order to have an opportunity to
win. Jan Ujevich won the event,
and Barber took third.

Even though co-captain Jan
Ujevich’s times weren’t up to
national standards, Belowich said
she should be able to have a good
year.

said. “Their the offsides receiver
came across the field, and I just
happened to be under the ball.”

Brooks, who started the season as
a backup, became a starter after
Woods suffered a cracked vertebra
in his neck in the West Virginia
game. ‘ '

“I wasn’t really expecting to get
as much playing time as I have,"
Brooks said. “I played behind
Michael Woods, and I expected
him to hold his position."

Brooks has blossomed into a cap-
able replacement, filling a void in
the Pitt defense. Still, he gives
credit to Woods, the man he
repleced.

“We practice together everyday,
and I guess I picked up a few
things," Brooks said.

Pitt has picked up a few things
also —— mainly, Michael Brooks
and _[oe Mc(Zall.

Ihe team’s strengths were dis-
played by Ulana Kohutiak, a
sophomore middle blocker, and
Diane Zack, a senior outside
hitter-—both of whom were named
to the all-tournament team. Gaul,
paced by her errorless setting all
weekend, was a unanimous choice
for the all—school MVP selection.

Georgetown, expected to meet
Pitt in the finals before the tourna-
ment play even started, racked up a
perfect 4-0 match record before
meeting Pitt.

Pitt cruised to a victory over the
Hoyas 15-7, 15-6, 15-13. The first
two game wins came with Pitt’s
front line neutralizing the George-
town’s two most explosive hitters,
Nicole Gigger and Karen
McGlothlin.

“Shutting down their two
attackers was one of our main
priorities,” Collier said afterward.

Belcher and middle blocker Car-
men Tapia successfully established
stone walls in the face of Gigger
and McGlothlin. The first game
also saw well-executed digs by
Pitt’s backcourt specialists.

In fact, Pitt played flawless
volleyball, if one discounts part of
game three. Georgetown fell
behind 5-10 at one point and
mounted a fierce comeback, clos-
ing the score to 13-14. The Pan-
thers, though, did not crack,
although they did use a six-player
rotation at 13-6 to finally earn the
championship point.

“We had a mental letdown in the
last game,” Zack said.

Collier provided more insight
into his squad's partial breakdown
in the third game.

“We were pumped up for a great
match and played that way for the
first two games,” he explained.
“When we’re prepared mentally
and strategically, we can do great
things. Otherwise, we have great
troubles." '

Pitt’s problems were not unex-
pected. The team was simply
trouncing the Hoyas from all
corners. Gaul was taking passes
and setting extraordinarily well.
Hitters Judy Young, Belcher and
Zack came through with crushing
spikes.

These three played a very liberal
game, shooting for and usually hit-
ting the corner and sideline shote.
Kohutiak and Tapia, hitters in the
inside, co—ordinated sets with Gaul

WEST POINT, N.Y.—A battle
took place at Army"s Michie Sta-
dium last Saturday. Even though
Army was 4-5 for the season, it was
not about to bow to defeat without
a fight.

The Panthers won the contest by
a 24-6 margin and outplayed the
Black Knights in almost every fac-
tion of the game, but they had
problems.

On numerous occasions, the
Panthers moved the ball deep into
Army territory but failed to put
points on the board for their drives.

As senior linebacker Charles
“Yogi” Jones put it, “We moved
the ball well, but we just didn't put
it in."

It was a recovery from the Notre
Dame upset, but it was probably
not impressive enough to catch the
attention of the major bowl scouts.

Although the Panthers didnot
crush the Black Knights by the 32
point margin that was projected,
(loach Foge Fazio believes that this
game will not affect bowl bids.

“I don’t think that it will affect
us," Fa/io said. “They (the bowl
scouts) watched the first half. and
they know what we can do."

I ers Capture Big East Championship

and served hits on the Hoyas’
vulnerable areas. When they had
to, backcourt players Sally Gilles-
pie and Robin Kukalis were ready
to dig out Georgetown’s spikes and
let Gaul finish‘ up the work.

The Lady Panthers established
these sequences with clockwork
efficiency for two and a half games
against Georgetown, but with the
championship within reach, the
team experienced its letdown. No
matter, though. Losing only six
matches all season, Pitt relied on its
experience in past pressure
situations.

It was a mellowed-out head
coach who reflected matter-of-
factly after the championship was
assuredly in hand.

“It’s a job-well-done kind of feel-
ing,” Collier said of his team’s vic-
tory in the first annual Big East
championship. “We’re not really
ecstatic because it was an accomp-
lishment we were aware of. We
almost played as if there was the
relief in the middle of the third
game—we knew our preparation
paid off.

“That was the key—we were
very, very prepared.”

Collier later praised George-
town’s program as “good and
solid.” He described the Hoyas as a
very patterned team that sets its hit-

ters in the same situations and sub- -

sequently hits in a predictable
manner.

Equally as predictable was the
way in which Pitt would handle
opposing schools prior to the
finals—the opposition did not
manage a lot
scoring. -

Seton Hall coach Lucy Ticki
planned on keeping her 13-I7 (sea-
sonal match record) team together.

“Our defense is so strong,” she
said before facing Pitt. “(We) have
the drive to not let the ball drop to
the floor; we don’t shy away at the
net.”

That idea vanished quickly as
Pitt totally controlled Seton Hall,
15-2, 15-0. '

Pitt started its Saturday three-
match battle against fifth-seeded
Syracuse. Gaul proved her MVP
worth, as she combined with the
outside hitters to mix spiker decoys
and powerful hits with consis-
tency. The Orange never realisti-'

rounded

The Panther offensive machin-
ery seemed to stop functioning
after the first half. After gaining a
24-0 lead before the half, Fazio
decided to go the conservative
route. .

“We played quite basic football
in the second half,” Fazio said.
Along with the numerous second
and third team substitutions, the
Panthers’ offensive unit failed to
enlarge the lead.

It was a very productive game for
the Panther running backs, gain-
ing 295 yards on the ground, I29 of
which were carried by joe McCall,
who started his first game since his
sophomore year and had his first
I00-yard plus game ever.

The Panthers’ air attack was not
as effective, completing l0 of I9
passes for 71 yards. Quarterback
Dan Marino also was intercepted
three times which stopped several
of the scoring drives.

The interceptions and passing
yardage were a direct result of
Army's defensive strategy.

“They had five of six defensive
backs in—it is hard to pass in that
type of situation," Fazio said.

The first play of the Panther
offensive series set the tone for the

iwalk-on potential is zero. Before
1975, trips across town used to be a
big deal. Then scholarships
became our only hope."

McClure, a full-time physics
professor, utilizes his money
wisely, as the NCAA slowly recog-
nizes ,women’s sports as a new
entity. He said it is pertinent for
weaker programs, like his was in
1974, to take advantage of the Big
East and the interconference play it
has to offer now.

“Before 1976, it was Coke and
cookies for women’s volleyball
until scholarships came along,"
McClure said. “The entry into the
NCAA with conferences is a new
entity, a new watershed for us
now."

Although McClure refuses to
place the Pitt-Georgetown rivalry
on the Pitt-Penn State level, he
praised the work of Pitt coach Shel-
ton Collier.

“I admire Collier’s work and his
success. He’s sitting in’ Fat City,"
he said, referring to the talent Col-
lier can draw from Pennsylvania
for recruiting. I

McClure cannot directly explain
the reasons behind his nine-games-
abov_e-.500 seasons. , This year
might have changed that, had the
Hoyas not bounced back from dis-
mal performances during their first

' 10-l2 matches.

The Pitt News, Monday November 15, 1982 5

A major reason behind the
rebound was McClure’s prize mid-

- dle hitter—Nicole Gigger. “She

was one of my recruiting coups in
1978," he said. *

An imposing hitter at the net,
possessing an arm that can launch
one of those MX missiles, Gigger
and Hoyas have come back well for
a second seed this weekend and a
31-12 record.

0 As Pitt prepares for NCAA
competition, slated to start the first
week of December, they now pos-
sess a 40-6 seasonal match mark
after going 5-0 this weekend in
matches and 12-0 in game
competition.

Outside hitter Diane Zack let the
Lady Panthers this weekend with
41 kills, followed by Ulana Kohu-
tiak (31), Carmen Tapia (24),
Robin Kukalis (18), Pat Belcher
(14), Judy Young (13) and Julie
Gaul (12).

0 A major reason behind Colli-
er’s sucess this season is his advance
scouting mode. He charts ‘in
advance, as he did this weekend
during pool play, serve receptions,
setter consistencies, spikers’ moves
and defense formations.

“We match our lineup to put our
blockers on their best hitters," Col-
lier explained. “You chart tenden-
cies so you can play for the

percentage block and percentage
defense against another team’s
defenses."

Collier relies heavily upon
assistant coach Ellen Mangus, who
knows the Lady Panthers’
strengths and weaknesses’. This
knowledge is easily applicable
when preparing for matches,
against the teams of such caliber as
Georgetown.

Collier views foes’ practices with
a critical eye.

“In volleyball you have to be
crisp and demand a kind of preci-
sion like that in gymnastics,” he
said. “Teams’ performances come
down to whether they can transfer
what they do in practice to what
they can do in actual play."

Watching warmups, Collier
looks for execution of grilling the
ball, defensive drills, fluid consis-
tency in passing and setting and
hammering of the ball over the net.

“We like to think ofourselves as
a ‘machine,’ "Collier said. “We did
that against Seton Hall. Our play-
ers try to make sure that execution
is done with utmost authority. Just
falling to the floor is not enough.
We can't rely on other teams’ mis-
takes, either.”

When Collier reaches the third
game of a best-ol-three match, the
match comes down to a coaching

duel. ‘‘It is strategy versus stra-
tegy,” he said. “Coaches have to
communicate to their players what
has to be done to get the edge.

“Many times, coaches are good,"
Collier continued, “but they can’t
get that communication across.
For us, we'll only give other teams
the options we want them to have."

Collier can easily stand by that.
His 40-6 record attests to the solid
communication established
between him and the Lady Pan-
thers, thus enabling them to earn a

Big East championship and the
NCAA berth that goes along with
it.

0 It should be of more than pass-
ing interest that outside hitters
Sally Gillespie and Judy Young
were pictured on Friday's front
sports page in the Post-Gazette.

Gillespie and Young are two
integral forces behind Pitt's 1982
Cinderella story. It's too bad it
takes certain conditions—an NFL
players strike—for a volleyball
team to gain the recognition it
would otherwise miss.

PSU Survives Irish

By IRA M. KATZ

SOUTH BEND, IND.--The
Penn State Nittany Lions moved
one step closer to selecting the post-
season bowl game of their choice
by defeating Notre Dame here last
Saturday. 24-14.

A capacity crowd witnessed an
extremely hard hitting football
game that resulted in many injur-
ies for both squads.

The game had a high level of
attention — artificial lights
installed on top of the historical
stadium accommodated a national
television audience.

The most costly injury belonged
to Notre Dame quarterback Blair
Kiel, who had to leave the game in
the opening few minutes with ten-
donitis in the shoulder of his pass-
ing arm.

Kiel initially suffered the injury
the previous week in the Pitt game.
It bothered him throughout the
week prior to the match-up against
the Lions.

lr1s_h coach Gerry Faust sum-
moned former Shaler High quar-
terback Ken Karcher to direct the
offense.

Karcher did an adequate job fill-
ing in for the injured Kiel. He com-

yards.

One particular play that Karcher
will remember from a positive
standpoint occurred when he com-
pleted a pass, on a fourth and one
situation, for a touchdown.

“It was the most exciting
moment for me,” Karcher said. He
was quick to add, though, “You
can't live on those small moments,
and I'm disappointed in that I
think I could have done better.”

In it’s victory over the Irish,
Penn State used a multiple offense
combining the rushing talents of
senior Curt Warner and the arm of
Todd Blackledge to open the Irish
defense.

Warner carried the ball 25 times
for 143 yards, and Blackledge
passed for 189 yards.

Blackledge, who was briefly
knocked out of the game, said of
the big win, “It was pretty tough
for awhile, but I feel all right now."

“We've played a lot of close
games,” Blackledge added. “We
know how to handle tough situa-
tions rather well.”

Maybe the best person to com-
pare this current Lion team with
those of years past is Coach Joe
Paterno.

“I think we’re playing as well as
any Penn State team I’ve coached,"
Paterno said, adding, “It will take a
great team to beat us.".

Penn State’s next opponent is
Pitt. It would be safe to assume that
Penn State presently has the advan-
tage over Pitt of picking the bowl
game of its choice.

In the Penn State locker room
after the game, only a couple of
players voiced opinions as to who
they would like to play on New
Year’s Day.

“I’d like to play Georgia,”
Warner said. “Herschel Walker is a
great back, probably the best in the
country and a real gentleman. I
have a lot of respect for him.”

A number of others wouldn’tl

reveal which bowl they would like
to appear in but said that they
would like to go anyplace where a
national championship could be
won.

.-\fterwards. Syracuse coach
.\Iai‘k Massey reviewed his team's
effort. “We have some weak serve
receivers," he said. “Pitt neutral-
i/ed out middle blockers. ['sua1ly,
we play well against a power
offense like Pitt's because of the few
options it has—cross court. deep or
down the line. Today. though, we
had nobody who could coiisist—
ently put the ball away for us."

(Iollier was not overwhelmed by
his squad's serving tendencies.
“The entire success of our team is
going to rely on how aggressively
we serve. This tneatis trying to hit
to the vulnerable area.

“We can't be just satisfied put-
ting the ball in the court-—we have
to toy with the corners in the
money matches."

Villanova came next. Pitt tasily
prevailed 15-3, 15-0. Kohutiak
almost single—handedly carried the
team, serving seven and eight
straight points in the two games.

Villanova coach Bob Covell
readily acknowledged the Lady
Panthers’ talent. “We have no

height to stay out there with
them." he said. “Pitt played with
flat-otit cannons. and that is what

power volleyball is all about. Their

outside hitters are very strong."

.i\t this point. the Lady Panthers
had reached the semi—finals and
were prepared to face third-seeded
Providence. The Lady lilriars lost to
Georgetown in theotlier pool play.
Belorehand, Providence coach
I)i< k Bagge outlined team strategy.

“We have to score ll1()I’(’})()lIl15.”
he said. “Our offense is built
around our shortest (_]tidy Barnes)
and tallest (Lori DiRentiis) hitters.
\\'hen Lori is on, she‘s awesoine——
nothing gets l)y her.

‘'We’ll give Pitt a game—l say
that seriously."

Indeed, the game proved his
words. Pitt was not digging sys-
tematically or getting the 1)all past
Provitlence‘s front-liiie netters.
Tapia pounded tnissile shots over
the net, only to have the l)all regu-
larly dtig tip by the Lady Friars.

After a 11-1-1 deadlock, Kukalis
set things in order with a viciotis
spike and Tapia ended a potential
game-loss with a convincing
smash over the net. Final score:

 

9 $

“Astonishing virtuosity .
“Such consummate Artistry Is A Rare Experience!”
“Roused His Audience To Thunderous Applause!”
.“SubtIe‘, Amazing virtuosity Simply Unbelievable!"

 

Pitt. 16-11. The Lady Panthers
later overcaine serving irregulari-
ties and handily defeated Provi-
dence 1.3-9. 15-2 and headed for the
(‘ieorgetown showdown.

Overall. the Pitt squad shined at
Providence. They showed every one
how the gaine is played——not only
during matches. l)ut during practi-
ces as well. During wariiiups. (Jol-

lier continually utilized the team i:

"pass-set—haminer" drills. so that
the squad had no trouble transfer-
ring to acttial play.

G.\.\lF. Sl{R\'ES: One winning
edge on the team was the consistent
outside hitting of Zack. one of the
all—tournament selections. "I‘m

award. “It really makes tne feel

good. It's a happy—crying kind of
feeling good. I‘m really touched.“
Kohtitiak grinned from ear to ear
as she proudly talked about her
recognition. “The whole idea of
this weekend made me play much
better. Especially since we're help-
ing the seniors. I am so happy now.
It makes everything very
satisfying." I

play, and the Panthers’ realized
that a true battle was in store.

The Panthers converted the

zone for the second Panther touch-
down. This reception broke Gor-
don Jones‘ career touchdown
record of 21. Dawkins said he was
not aware of his achievement until
after the game.

The next scoring run originated
on the Panthers’ own 11-yard line.
A succession of runs by fullback
Marlon McIntyre and freshman
tailback Darnell Stone moved the
ball deep into Black Knight terri-
tory. Marino once again found
Collins open in the end zone for the
