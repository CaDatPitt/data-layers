Hughes also indicated that to

The Phi Kappa fraternity at-

New C'oizr.s'e
Is Offered

To Women

Last week a group of Stephens
college seniors were addressed by
T. B. Wilson of New York, chair-
man of the Board of Transconti-
nental & Western Airways, Inc.,
on the opportunities for women in
commercial aviation.

This group was’ the opening
class of “Aviation 1,” a course in
commercial air transport opera-
tions, which is the ﬁrst of its kind
ever offered in an American girls’
college.

Thecourse covers all phases
of the industry, and is being con-
ducted by four airlines —- TWA,
Chicago & Southern, Mid-Conti-
nent and Braniﬂ’. The course does
not include actual ﬂight instruc-
tion but full scholastic credit is
being offered for it.

Wilson declared that the femi-
nine aviation jobs will increase in
number and importance as the
business expands in the post-war
period. t

He says that in the present
emergency many men who have
been called to the Selective Serv-
ice have been replaced inmany
cases by women. They are learn-
ing the groundwork in the indus-
try as reservation clerks and tele-
phone sales representatives, and
will. be qualiﬁed for executive
posts later.

The president of Stephens, Dr.
James M. Wood, was congratulat-
ed for the . school’s progressive
spirit in adopting the new course,
and it was predicted that the ex-
ample would be followed in time
by other schools.

Wilson said, “I believe that the
day it not far off, when other col-
leges will adopt similar courses in
their curricula to point the way
to the careers in the air transport

week will officially end at '2 o’-
clock Sunday morning, when fra-
ternity silence week will begin.
During that week fraternity men
will not be permitted to approach
any freshmen regarding frater-
nity matters.

Silence week will continue until
5 o’clock Monday, October 27,
when those accepting bids will re-
port to the respective house of
their choice.

Rushing and fraternity weeks
this year were postponed one week
from the original dates. Leaders
of fraternity men proposed the
postponement because -it was be-

lieved that mafiy members of fra-
ternities would be absent during
the most important days of the
program, due to the Michigan
game.

Many fraternity men are mem-
bers of the Band, others belong
to the football squad, and /a num-
ber attended the game as Pitt
fans. ,

The conﬂict in the fraternity
program with the football schedule

was explained by Roy H. Umble,
assistant to the dean of men. He
said that when the fraternity plan
was made last spring, the football
schedule was not and could not
have been formulated.

us Policymuaalea;
Must Decide Soon

By FRANK MASTORAKI

The United States should not be
blammed for starting the war,
but deserves all the condemnation
for prolonging the suﬁering and
the pain and the hell of war. The
policy of the United States is mud-
dled. It consists of intervention
as a plan, and neutrality as the
action. Neither Britain nor Ger-
many can clearly conceive what
the intentions of this country are.

On one hand the United :States
promises all-out aid to Great
Britain, but is limited in fulﬁll-

. ing'those promises. On the other
hand, the United States threatens
violence to Germany, but draws a?
line where no further violence is
permitted. -

The world is tired of death and
sacriﬁce. Nations have been
drained of all their resources in
one huge effort to defeat or de-

fend an enemy or an ideology.-

People are disappointed with the
United States, “I would if I could
but I can’t so I don’t” stand.

lt is high time that efforts of
United States leaders be divert-
ed from oratorical action to deﬁ-

nite aftion, leading us in one of"

two directions. Any one of the
.two following plans would mate-
rially help put an end to the war.

First, the United States could
bring the war to a conclusion by
refusing to give any more material
or moral aid to Great Britain or
her allies. This would deﬁnitely
pave the way for an eventual -Ger-
man victory.

Or, second, the United States
could exert all her effort and re-
. sources  eatéﬂ"  D

United States could send arms,
more arms, and with the arms
the United States must send men.

Indeed the prospect of peddling
American blood to European
shores is not a pleasant one. We
must remember that if we call
ourselves true men and women
who feel deeply the loss of Amer-
ican lives (and I am referring to
the mother organizations), then
we must equally sympathize» with
the people who are suffering and
lamenting the many dead and
wounded in Europe and Asia.

We must recall the 4th of July
speech wherein we eulogized the
sacriﬁces of our forefathers. ‘If
democracy means as much to the
American as the text bool: and
the speeches reveal they do, then
they must be willing to send their
boys to ﬁglit and_ die in the ﬁelds
from which their forefathers
sprang.

Of course. we can end the war
by allowing Germany to win. This
is not a very savory prospect. One
thing is certain, Great Britain can-
not win the war alone, no mat-
ter how much material we send
her, as long as we do not send
men. The decision is a straining
one. It is also the more trying
because it is neither Britain’s or
Germany’s. Ours is the decision.

Prol<oscl1 Writes Novel

About Pre-War Europe

BY CHARLES FINEMAN
Every book that Frederic Pro-

kosch has written possesses an

elusive, a l m o s t beyond—capture
quality. His latest novel THE
SKIES OF EUROPE is no excep-
tion.

At first sight the strangely in-
tense phrasing holds the reader-
Prokosch’s style is reminiscent of
a melody by Debussy» and 35
Debussy creates a mood with just
a few notes, Prokosch, with
complete yet fragmented details,
strikes- the essence of a difficult
moment. But Pr-_ol:osch's other
novels—THE ASIATICS, THE
SEVEN WHO FLED, and NIGHT

OF THE POOR—-—served for the

development of this style.

THE SKIES OF EUROPE is
his ﬁrst novel dealing with a basic
social theme. The theme is Europe
—-pre-war Europe—as its sky of
freedom slowly darkens under the
Nazi threat. The gloom settles
upon the life of his characters,
and the social pressure sets them
restlessly searching for a new
truth.

The action of the plot is
simple. Phillip, a. young Ameri-
can drifting over Europe, meets
and falls in love with Sashia, a
Ruthenian refugee. Phillip’: love
for Sashia, physically satiated,
brings him no spiritual rest, and
he is unable to hold her. Driven
into restlessness he wanders over
Europe.

In Germany he senses a vague
undertone of despair, of crossed
purpose- This uneasiness he ﬁnds
duplicated -ina Spayin-torn by civil

Austria and I ‘ know the

same bewilderment. -. .

Phillip is then driven into an .

analysis of his own confusion. The
passion for Sashia has cooled, and
his thinking clears. In an ltalian
fishing village he suddenly ﬁnds

words :

“’l‘he”sound of the waves was A

like a gigantic requiem. These
waves, I thought, are washing the
edge of Europe . . . a wave, longer
than the others,“
shoreward. Now a ripple blows
across the long, slow wave, dull-
ing it . . .

“Then it gleam; again, :1 mon-
otonous luster, but stealthy now
and dangerous . . . small waves
have broken along the shore . . .;
and now the great wave begins
to purr with a tremendous secret
exultation, crouching for its ﬁnal
lelp . . . a. deep howl thunder:
down the coast for miles. The
wave has broken."

In spots THE SKIES OE
EUROPE fails to be effective. The

characterization is sometimes too ’

analytic to be real. The descrip-
tion is sometimes forced, but it is

a good book, and well worth going ,

to the Alldred room to read.

At the Nixon . . .

Every so often a play slides into
New York virtually unheralded,
receives luke-warm notices from
the critical fraternity, and then
pi-ocee is to set up a run that has
‘the public blinking and the pro-
ducer pinching himself.

Anne Nichols did it with her
“Abie’s Irish Rose" and, of
course, Jack Kirkland saw his
“Tobacco Road" develop into a
phenomenal success after first
weathering , critical blasts and
public indifference. By sheer de-
termination of their producers,
(and a liberal allowance) these
plays hung on until theater goers
began to take notice and got to
see for themselves what made the

This is a light, inconsequental

enough and often enough to be
familiar to anyone who likes heart-
warming humanness with his
amusement. “Mr. Harlem,” getting
well along in years, still steps with
the best of them. His legs have
lost some of their spring, but none
of their rhythm. For Friday’s audi-
encc he performed easily, tirelessly
and graciously.

Jimmy Lunceforcl's outﬁt is
one that should be better known
to those‘ outside the select circle
of Swingiana. Lunceford and his
boys put out a brand of lilting
music that is as timeless ’as a
jungle drumbeat. If there is such
a thing as restraint in the brass
section of a swing band, then
Jimmy's hornrmen have it, and in
good measure.

On the screen, “Married Bache-
lor” bring together Robert Young
and Ruth Hussey in a combination
which should see the two appearing
together in a cycle to imitate, but
not rival, the Loy—Powell series.

The picture is a sort of poor
man's “Philadelphia Story," with
many shots of shuttered bunga-
lows and cozy‘-but-not-gaudy liv-
ing rooms. It is meant deﬁnitely
to appeal to the bourgeois in us,
and at times is a welcome relief
from shots of penthouses and
built-in bars. Bob Young‘, with a
mustache, tickles the fancies of
female theatergoers.

Zoom! I arrived in Brooklyn

Brooklyn chief of police insisted
that I take along an escort of 100
policemen. One would -think that
I was leaving civilization. The at-
mosphere was a bit gloomy. Hard-
ly a soul walked the streets. The
doors and windows were shut and
barred. I continually heard thump-
ing sounds escaping from many of
the homes. They sounded like

bony matter bouncing against
walls.
They were all followed by

moans and groans. ‘ Another
thing that amazed me was the
way dogs ran for blocks when
they saw someone coming. They

Undergraduate ~
Deans to ‘Assist
Registrar Quiclc I

The University program of co~ \

operation with high schools of the
district was further strengthened
last week by the appointment of

W: ’

the undergraduate deans to com- '

plement the work of J. G. Quick,
registrar, in visiting the principals
and superintendents of the area.

Rufus H. Fitzgerald, provost,
emphasized the importance of or-
ganized high school contacts and
recommended ,that assistance of
all kinds and in all ﬁelds be given
the visitation staﬁ’.

Mr. Fitzgerald stated that the
program of high school visitation
aided the University in gaining,

additional information on its stu-

dents and enabled high school
principals and faculties to obtain
information on the progress of
their former students.

Mr. Quick will be aided in his
work because of the increasing
pressu.re of University talks, Mr.
Fitzgerald explained.

Miss Helen Poole Rush, acting
dean of women, advised the deans

of the various schools at a meet- '

ing last week ‘that the interest of
high -school principals in social ad.

justment and leadership of their

former students was high.

She informed the deans that the
office of the dean of women was
prepared to furnish the necessary
information. _

Plans of the office of the dean
of men and of the deans of the
other undergraduate schools for
co-operation in the plan have not
been revealed.

Would you have any trouble
locating Kyaukpyu?

You would?

Then maybe you need a little
light on the subject.

The Alldred room will be glad
to furnish it for you in the form
of an illuminated globe which
may be used byany student.

About 16 inches in diameter,
the glass globe rests on a stand
three feet high. The light from
within makes it “extremely easy
to read,” acording to Mrs. J.
Howard Dice, librarian in the All-

The globe contains the princi-

Local Business

Shows Gains ,
For Last Week

Increased business activity last
week in the Pittsburgh district,
due chieﬂy to the settlement of the
coal industry strike, is reported by
the Bureau of Business Research
of the University. River ship-
men'ts, consisting mainly of coal,
were near the highest weekly ton-
nage this year, while electrical out-
put again exceeded previous rec-
ords.

Iron and steel
change. Out of a total of 47
blast furnaces in the district, 44
continue at near capacity pro-
duction.

A slight lowering in the season-
ally adjusted trade index last week
was noted.

Department store sales showed
a normal gain, but motor car reg-
istrations and other trade index
components were lower after the
seasonal adjustment. As com-
pared to a year ago, department
store sales are heavy while those
of the past four weeks have been
18 percent higher than at the
same period last year.

General business activity has
risen to 146..2 percent of the 192." -
25 average. Average of the week
ending September 27 and 144.9 and
only 122.5 in the corresponding
week last year. Excluding the pe-
riod of coal shutdown in April, the
business index this year has rang-
ed between 138.6 and 154.2.

By ALEX ZELENSKI, Sports Editor

ANN ARBOR, Michigan,
Oct. 11-—The most humiliat-
ing defeat ever stamped upon
a Pitt grid team was record-
ed here today before a crowd
of 34,403 when Captain Bob
Westfall, Tommy Kuzma, and
Co. ran rough-shod over a far
inferior Panther team, 40-0.

The whole story is Pitt’s defense
was very inadequate, and the Pan-
ther backs had no blocking-
through the line.- Probably the
best way to explain is through the
statistics.
from the line of scrimmage while
Michig-;an’s jackrabbit backs ac-

 

cumulated a total of 274 yards at 3

the expense of the Blue and Gold
warriors
First Kuzma
At the end of the First half ev-
ery local fan in the Nlichigan
Stadium was elated for the Pan-

thers looked much better than,

they had the previous week
against Purdue. But then came
the storm and the
took advantage
error and converted them into
scores. There were many Pan-
ther errors and many Michigan
scores. -

Superb blocking by Michigarﬁsl

burly linemen made it possible,
time after time, for sophomores
Kuzma and Nelson to run through
and around the Panther line al-
most at will. If it weren't Kuzma
and Nelson mailing" first downs, it
was Captain Bob Westfall tearing‘
off valuable yardage through the
center of the line. C

Stanley Gervelis was once
again the only Pitt_re-gular to
stand out.on the ﬁeld of play.
Gervelis was the whole left side
of the Panther line as he repeat-

. eclly broke up enemy intcrfernce
and broke through to nab the ball
carrier.

Then Nelson

Michigan’s only tally of the first
half came when Kuzma’s pass to
Ceithaml was incomplete but ruled
valid because of interference by
Dutton on the play. That play
started the Michigan attack rolling
as Westfall and Kuzma took turns
carrying the ball up to the Pitt 23
yard stripe. Then Lockard on a.
wide lateral made it a first down
on the 10 yard line. A couple
more plays with VVestfall and Kim-
ma carrying‘ advanced the ball a
few more yards, then the‘ touch-
down came with Lockard going
wide around end.

Michigan came back on the
ﬁeld after the half ready to go
and go they did for they recov-
ered Dutton’s fumble on the 25
yard line with only two minutes
of the third period gone and sent
Kuzma through tackle for the.sec-
ond score.

Then Wesl-fall ‘

Then came the break in the
f.,>'2llYl€ that made a close contest
turn into a rout. Kuzma took a
punt return midway in the third
period and ran back thi'oLig:h the
entire team for a 48 yard touch-
down. Blocking by the VVolver--
lines on this play was brilliant for
nary a Pantherman laid a hand on
him.

This must have hit Pitt. a tell-
ing blow for a few plays later,
Nelson, subbing for Kuzma, grab-
bed another punt return and ran
58 yards for a touchdown. But
it was called back to the 22 yard
line because of clipping, and Pitt
once again had their backs to the
wall. Not for long, however, as
in exactly four plays the Michigan
team chalked up another six points.
Then a headache

The rest of the fourth quarter
was no contest. What had start-
ed out to be a close contest had
already turned into a farce. Mich-
igan used third and fourth string
players, but still that precise
blocking was there and they
pushed over two more tallies.
Nelson and Robinson made the
touchdowns.

With only one minute left to
play, the Wolverines by some
means or matter got their team
down on the Pitt one yard line.
But both time and Gervelis were
against them and time won, stop-
pin, their drive for {their seventh

their ace pass thrower and lead-

AE&ME's are the pre-season fa-

vorites.

Two of last year’s standout
players, “Bulgy Dave” Mamaux
and “Mad Marshall” VVinkler are
back on the team and are sure to
more than their share in making;
the AE&ME’s a standout aggrega-

The opening tilt of the day,

either squad other than they are

An efficient combinationof for-
ward passing and line bucking‘,

gave a strong Navy Junior varsity ,

eleven an easy "32 to 0 victory
over Pitt’s Jayvees, at Annapolis.
last Friday. ~

The l\/lidshipman hit “pay dirt”
five times, crossing the Panther
goal line in every.pe1'iod but the
third. Gilly Gillil-and substitute
halfback, led the Navy onslaught,
scorin,<_>; two touchdowns. ,

Pitt’s best scoring‘ effort was
stopped forty-ﬁve yards short of
the goal. One of the very few
bright spots in the Panther at-
tack, was the outstanding play of
Bruce Renter, Panther halfbaék.
Quite a few’ times, he broke away
for substantial but ultimately use-
less gains.

The Blue and Gold starting line-,

up had Pierre at left end; Ramsey,
left tackle; Marlades, left, guard;
Kunkel, center; Rabinek,
guard; Stodgell, right
Lohmeyer, right end; Emerick,
quarterback; Reuter, left half;

Lohmeyer, Skladany, and Kun-
kel at times showed signs in their
respective performances of being
of varsity caliber.

The Pitt-Navy Jayvee fracas,
was obviously disappointing from
the local point of view. But the
game did give the Juniors some
much needed competitive experi-

next inter-collegiate Junior varsity
game will show some improvement
in the Panthers.

year on the varsity.

Teaming up with Paffrath to
lead the Panthers, will he hlonde
Eddie’ “Lefty" Ziolkowski, an-
other three year man. Ziolkow-
ski is holding on to aininety-day
army deferment, and will proba-
bly he called into the service be-
fore the end of the season.

Another of last year’s key men
expected to form the nucleus of

thewarsity with Paifrath and Ziol-
kowski, is junior Tay Malarkey.

‘ Malarkey saw plenty of action la-st

lyearand promises to be one of the

squads outstanding performers.

Three other experienced play-
ers, all juniors, will also report
today. They are Johnny Swacus,
former Scott high star, who saw
enough action to earn his letter;
Paul Lohmeyer, 6 foot 4 inch cen-
ter from Central Catholic; and
Bob Artman, shifty trick shot art-
ist from Cat-rick.
