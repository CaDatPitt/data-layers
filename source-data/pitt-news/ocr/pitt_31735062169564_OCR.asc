On Saturday Night at 11:05 an in-
cident occurred that should be of con-
cern to every student at the Univer-
sity. As my friend and I approached
the steps leading to the dormitory on
the Forbes Avenue side We noticed
several teenagers standing on the first
landing harassing people entering and
leaving the dormitory. As we approach-
ed the landing, one of them pulled
a knife and proceeded to hurl obscen-
ities at us.

Brandishing _this weapon, he step-
ed towards me threateningly but as
I continued forward he backed away.
They let us past meanwhile continu-
ing to threaten and taunt us with
words and phrases. V

As we reached the top I approach-
ed a campus policeman and informed
him of what was going on. I was
told this had happened to other stu-
dents and that the police would take

of the gang were later apprehended

by Pittsburgh police and charged with

“Assualt with a deadly weapon.”

V This occurence is just one of many
campus disturbances that pose a dir-
ect threat to student living here or
visiting.

For Example:

A thief wascaught by campus pol-
ice who admitted to 78 robberies in
Tower C alone.

A gang known as the “Sharkey Boys”
have been seen hanging around the
dorms and snack bars’ harassing stu-
dents and causing trouble. A young
hood of only about 14 pulled a gun on a

‘student in the towers snack bar.

Then there was the maniac who
fired several shots into the girls’

The Tuck Shop Robbery, still un-
solved. - 1

Robberies in the Cathedral.

And how about the time a teenager
off the streets walked into a girl’s
room in Tower C while she was a-
sleep. She woke. up and the stranger
left.

and they let their audiences know
it. Differing from most vocal
groups, the Lettermen all have
the same range and interchange
their parts. In addition, they all
do solo work, which makes~the
group more interesting to watch
as well as adding to their versat-
ility-.

The trio’s style is strongly in-
fluenced by the old groups, who
just sang standard tunes and sang ,
them well. Over the years, the’
Lettermen have been applauded
for'their folk songs, college songs
and ballads. There is beauty in
the harmonic blending of their
voices. It seems clear that they
deserve great credit for their
phenomenal success, especially’
in this age of electrically aug-

music.

The Lettermen, whose Capitol
albums have sold over four and

 Biafran Undergrad Speaks Out

Oghene C Proposes Aid Modification

James Oghene, an undergrad-

I uate student from'Biafra, stated
 that continuing our present man-
 ner of aid to Biafra “will only
 prolong the war, without chang-
. ling _the outcome—thus increasing

what you are trying to prevent.”

«Presently, over 14 million dol-

lars in aid is being sent to Biafra
to be distributed by the govern-
ment. Ten million dollars is U.S.
government aid; the other four
million is from church and pri-
vate organizations. According to
Oghene, “The government uses

' this aid for the cause of the war

and not of the people. In order to
prevent this, the United States
must send their own people to
Biafra to see that the food is not
given to the soldiers by the gov-
ernment.

Oghene objects vehemently to

committee is politically. rather
than humanitarianly. orientated.
“The Committee to Keep Biafrans
Alive would have been a better
choice of a name, for it would
have had the sanction of both .Bia-
trans and Nigerians alike.”
“Americans often get excited,
without knowing the complica-
tions of the situation,” Oghene
stated. “For example, there are
14 million inhabitants of Biafra.
Only seven million of these are
Ibos; the other seven million are

minority people. The members of
these minority groups want to re-
main part of Nigeria, since they
hold the mineral rights in Biafra.
Although the Ibos have the right
to determine their way of living,
the minority people also have a
right to determine theirs.”

Final Exam Schedule Is Released

Through t h e co - operation of
Fred Sehring, assistant to the reg-
istrar, the Academic Procedures
Committee of Student Govern- "
ment has released the fall term
final examination schedule.

In order to have the least
amount of schedule conflicts, ev-
ery student’s schedule was run
through the computer three times.
As a result, less than 400 students
will have time conflicts or more
than two finals on the same day;
in previous times there have been
as many as 1,500 students with
such conflicts.

In the past, a student was forc-
ed to wait until the last day to re-
schedule an examination; th i s
term three periods have been pro-
vided to make up finals—Thurs-
day, Dec. 12; Tuesday, Dec. 17;

' and Thursday, Dec. 19. Students

with schedule conflicts should
see their instructors as soon as
possible‘ to register for one of
three periods.

A list of examinations which 

will not be held in regularly
scheduled classrooms will be.
available in approximately two
weeks.

ROTC Credit  

The controversy concerning the accredidation of Univer-
sity ROTC courses can be resolved quite easily by taking away
credit from that departr_nent’s curricula. This, however would
be a superficial solution to a problem of a much broader
scope — the idea of accredidation itself.

The arguments for and against ROTC accredidation are
significant in a somewhat limited 'sense—they discuss the issues
of academic freedom, outside control of curriculum, and the
“student majority.” Looking beyond these arguments, we find
that the ROTC dilemma provides some clear cut answers to
student problems at the University. Rather than being totally
negative, The Pitt Newswill attempt to be constructive by
pointing out some of the significant implications that surface

from the complexities of the arguments.

For years, the ROTC program has been quite success-
ful. For years, the Brigade has supplied the Armed Forces
with many officers. The reason for this success is that ROTC
provides clearcut incentives for its members. Individuals
in the ROTC Advanced Program not only receive credit for
the courses they take, but receive a monthly payment of ap-
proximately $50. Coupled’to these very attractive incentives,
is the chance “for each member of the Brigade to join some
group related to the overall military program. Such incen-
tives certainly beef up the ROTC rosters, and cause an “es-
pite de corps” uncommon to other University groups. We cer- ~
tainly understand the Brigade’s intense disapproval of the
Undergraduate Council’s decision. The ROTC (program is
working well, and its members are logically satisfied with
the attractive incentives they enjoy. Consequently, they are
willing to seek student support to maintain the status-quo.

Unlike other student organizations, the ROTC program —
a program which is controled by the Defense Department —
provides pay and credit for its students. The great body of-
other student organizations can only provide such emply in-
centives as glory, power, prestige, and “campus fame.” These
personal conquests sound very impressive, but are really va-
cuos and personally unsatisfying attainments. They certainly
don’t provide credit toward graduation, or financial subsidy.

Student organizations on this campus, unlike ROTC,

‘ flounder because any student has to be crazy, or idealistically

dedicated to a cuase, to put a great deal of time into a student

’ activity. A student may spend anywhere from 10 to 30 hours

a week on an activity and receive no pay or academic credits
for his service. He may feel pride for his work. But such stu-
dents are” indeed a very slim minority at this University. On
the other hand, a student in the ROTC Brigade‘ might spend
hours working within the program. For his time he feels some
pride and satisfaction, "receives $50 a month payment (Ad-
vanced Program), and gains credits toward graduation.

We are faced with more than Defense Department con-
trol of the ROTC .curriculum and faculty appointments; we
are faced with more than an abuse of academic freedom; we
are faced with a whole series of inequities. ROTC is a dis-
tinct course of instruction separated from the Univer-
sity not by accredidation, but by outside faculty and cur-
riculum control. Thus, ROTC —— by its very definition — must
be considered a group of students in an outside program. It
is a student activity — a student activity that grants incenti-

' ves of financial payment and accredidation. This creates a

campus atmosphere reaking of inequities.

. The Pitt News feels that all student organizations, in.
cluding ROTC, should accrue the same benefits to its mem-
bers. By using the example of ROTC,' student organiza-
tions should use the tactics of giving its members incentives.
If ROTC is to continue to receive academic credit, other stu-
dent organizations should be allowed to give itsmembers aca-
demic credit.

This is not an argument of organizational .jealously, but
a plea for educational priority. The experience gained with in-
volvement-in student organizations is a boon to the student’s
education. Higher education is more than taking notes in
the classroom; it is more than passing final exams and handing
in long term -papers. It wasn’t by chance that Thomas Jeffer-
son said long ago that more was learned outside rather than in-
side the classroom. Why not give credit for specific and bene-
ficial learning experienced in student activities? This is done
now in ROTC.

To balance .out the present inequities, we urge the Aca-
demic Council to research the possibility of granting credit
towards graduation to students who dutifully serve the Univer-
sity by their activities in student organization. If a scheme
can be workedout, our priceless educations’ could finally be
placed in the right perspective. The incentives would be par-
tially balanced; If a feasible scheme can’t be realized, stu-
ctleelrits in ROTC should not receive credit for the courses they
, e. \

button. “Here.” he belched, “have a button on me.

I't’ll do you good.” Then he leaned against the eleva-
tor wall, sank to the floor, and slurred, “where’s
the next party . . . .?

For him. it was the perfect end. A final good-
bye. A goodnight. New York, the exciting town, was
his stage for the climax. But for 1500 collegians,
the ACP (Associated Collegiate Press) convention
was like a brand new beginning. Another start.

HERE’S WHERE they learned one of the tricks

have ever learned. New York. the colorful town,
was their stage for the performance.

The Waldorf-Astoria housed all of them. It was
their common home; a place of idealistic frustra-
tion where everyone discovered that everyone else
thought and felt exactly like everyone else. It was
their tomb of the future, something to look back on
only after they’re gone.

It didn’t matter what their names were; people

NEW YORK——The following are a few of the many
reflections garnered during a three day Associated
Collegiate Press convention here.

After twenty minutes of discussion at the first
room party in the Waldorf Astoria, I realized that
the words apathy, - student power and sandbox
journalism are used as frequently on campuses in
California, New Hampshire, Florida and Michigan as
they are here.

The majority of hippies in the East Village are
of late high school, early college age, and many are
under 16 years of age.

CENTRAL PARK on a Saturday afternoon of-
fers a unique cross section of American people and
activities that fascinate the passer-by to such an ex-
tent that the crowds around pick-up soccer and foot-
ball games numbered in the hundreds.

Many of the kids in New York make token ap-
pearances on the subway and ride for hours under
the streets for free. 1

SEVEN THOUSAND demonstrators tied traf-
fic up for hours with a demonstration march from
Nixon Headquarters to Humphrey headquarters.
Their signs, buttons and leaflets were in protest of

ROTC Issues, Where Are You?
The Facts Seem To Be Missing

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

' With all the emotionalism that
is swirling around the ROTC
issue, it would be beneficial for
everyone concerned to know what
is the basis for all the arguing.
Dave Ehrenworth, who is re-
presenting the group that fav-
ors the accredidation of ROTC,
told me that his group’s argu-
ment is based almost entirely on
the fact that the inadequate re-
search was done by the under-
graduate council; the body who
made the recommendation to take
accredidation away from ROTC.

I ASKED Mr. Ehrenworth

where he obtained the informa-.

tion that caused him to reach
this decision, and he said that he
had spoken with two of the
deans who are on the council. He
also said that by logically inter-
preting the vote of the council,

K it was obvious that they did not

fully understand the issue in
question. Ehrenworth said that if
the council had realized the ef-
fect that loss of accredidation
was going to have on the ROTC
program and the students at Pitt,
they would not have voted in the
manner that they did.

This explanation sounded too
pat to me, so I thought I should do
some investigating in order
to assure the validity of Ehren-
worth’s claim. Accordingly, I
went to Joe Kociubus, one of the
two students who were on the un-
dergraduate council.

Kociubus denied Ehrenworth’s

claim vehemently. He said that.

if Ehrenworth’s statements were
true, “he would be rewriting
history.” Kociubus informed me
that prior to the final decision of
the council, a great deal of infor-
mation had been supplied by
several parties. Dean Kehl sent
the council information from both
Army and Air Force ROTC.-
The council also received a

personal report from none other ,

than Dave Ehrenworth anda re-
port from the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet. Kociubus is president of
this organization.

Aside from the written informa-

' tion, there was a meeting of the

undergraduate council that lis-
tened to representatives of ROTC,
including Col. Clagget, and Ma-
jor Gordon. At this meeting,
the ROTC representatives were’
allowed to present their case, as
well as answer questions from
members of the council. Ehren-
worth has not denied this, but

he has said the ROTC was not re- 1

presented at the final council
meeting. The final council meet-
ing consisted of taking a vote on
the issue.

Does Ehrenworth claim that
the Pro-ROTC faction should

have been allowed to vote?

IN TALKING with Kociubus,
he made it clear that the real is-
sue is noth being discussed by
the members of ROTC.

The issue in question is not one
of inadequate research or not
enough representation, but
whether the legal aspects of
ROTC go against ~ the univer-
sity policy of academic freedom.
It seems that neither Ehrenworth
or LaPietra are willing to come
to grips with the issue.”

But just what are the legal as-
pects involved? Very simply,
it is just that the university has
no jurisdiction over the content
of the ROTC program. Accord-
ing to Army regulation 145-5:
“The Chief of Staff, U.S. Army,
exercises supervision and control
over the ROTC program.”

The same regulation describes
the duty of the ROTC instructor:
“His (the instructor’s) primary re-
sponsibility is to insure that the
ROTC program is administered
at the institution in accordance
with Army regulations, programs,

objectives, and policies . . . . ”

Another part of the same law
states that : “ROTC instructor
personnel will conduct only
courses of instruction prescribed
by the Department of the Army."

THESE REGULATIONS make

it abundantly clear that the U.
S. Army, and not the university.
has control over the entire ROTC
curriculum. In order for this in-
stitution to maintain a position
of complete academic freedom

it should have no part of a course
over which it has nolcontrol. The
faculty members should realize
that when a man is appointed to
teach a‘ course in Military
Science, he is not teaching a
course according to his own de-
sires, but the dictates of the Army.
He may vary his presentation,
but the content of the course must,
as the regulation requires: “up-
hold regulations, programs, ob-
jectives, and policies of the U.S.
Army.”

But there is yet another issue
that I am certain the faculty
will be interested in, and this
concerns the content of the
ROTC courses. The content of
the courses appears in an ROTC
manual. The comparisons were
done by Major'Henry Gordon.
an assistant professor of Mili-
tary Science. Let’s look at just
one of his courses, Military
Science 116.

According to the booklet, this
class is composed of the follow-
ing courses: GSPIA 248, Psych
21, Soc. 22, Soc 26, Soc 28, Soc
29,_ Ed 141, Ed 272, Ed 213, Ed
232, and GSPIA 260. 1

Now far be it for me to say that
all these courses are not being
taught effectively, but it does
seem very strange that one course
in ROTC given for three credits
would be the equivalent .of five
graduate courses and five under-
graduate courses.
courses can be taught in one class,
I think that members of the fac-
ulty should attend ROTC classes
and learn how the Army depart-
ment effectively crams thirty
credits into a_ three credit fifteen
week course.

THE ISSUE of ROTC has been
clouded by false charges and irra-

-tional emotionalism. The time

for that has ended. Now is the
time for the faculty to evaluate
the program on its legal aspects.

Now is the time for the mem-
pects. And now is the time for

pects. Find now is the time for .

studentsto be informed about all
sides of the issue.

Yetto’s ROTC Story Criticized

Editor, The Pitt News:

Bill Yetto's argument in the
Oct. 25 edition of The Pitt News
that ROTC should not be an ac-
credited course is apparently bas-
ed on weak logic and inexperi-
ence. The reason a person enrolls
at a university is to benefit him-
self and develop a future career.
The university's purpose is to af-

ROTC Concern
‘Re-evaluated’

Editor, The Pitt News:

In regard to the “Editorial”
of Nov. 1, 1968, in which the
right of a paper to editorialize
was substantiated and upheld,
we would like to comment on the
specific issue—at-hand, i.e. ROTC
and academic credit.

The persons who attack the
right of The Pitt News to take

an editorial stand on this issue‘

are misperceiving the function
of a student newspaper as is that
paper, which must substantiate
the taking of a stand with a flim-
.sy comparison to the New York
Times.

What is necessary in the dis-
cussion of ROTC and its receiv-
ing academic credit is not who is
entitled to take a stand on the is-
sue, but to bring facts to the atten-
tion of the student body.

Therefore. the following docu-
mentation is offered in support
of the stated differences between
the ROTC programs and the rest
of the University. ROTC in its
propaganda for recruiting stu-
dents. substantiates its giving

academic credit by citing Univer-

sity courses which are overlap-
ped in its curriculum. Included in
this list are Speech 21 (Introduc-
tion to Theatre Arts) and Sociol-
ogy 180 (Introduction to Ameri-
can Society). We do not feel that
the study of a specific area such
as Military Science coincides with
either of these general and basic
areas of study.

Present practice at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, with regard to
ROTC includes:

—the granting of a total of 2
credits for ROTC in the School
of Engineering:

-—the granting of up to 14 cred-
its for ROTC in the College of
Arts and Sciences;

——and the fact that all ROTC
instructors are at least given
the academic rank of Assistant
Professor.

The inconsistencies within this
list are apparent. Why do some
students receive more credits
toward graduation for ROTC
than others?

Why do the 4-year program
ROTC students in Arts and Sci-
ences, in fact, receive not only a
commission and pay but also the
equivalent of one full term of
academic credit?

Why do ROTC instructors ‘auto-
matically receive the title of
Assistant Professor without as-
cending the hierarchy of tenure,
as all othermembers of the fac-
ulty do‘?

We feel that these questions
are not only relevant to the is-
sue of granting academic credit
for ROTC but. further. that the
facts which answer them lead us"
to only one conclusion. The pol-
icy of granting academic credit
for ROTC must be re—evaluated.
We support the legitimate deci-
sion of the Undergraduate Coun-
cil in its recommendation.

ford him this opportunity so that
he, in turn, can ‘enhance the na-.
tion’s future. _

If a student is not to receive
credit for courses which. accord-_
ing to M. Yetto, are “basically
set up for the student’s benefit
in the future,” then why accredit
courses of other departments
which serve this same purpose?
Furthermore, why accuse thel
ROTC program of “unfairness”
simply because the athletic pro-
gram which directly benefits the
University is not accredited?

The University does-not award
credits according to the benefits
she directly receives herself,
but for the purpose previously
cited. If Mr. Yetto feels so strong-
ly about this point, he should di-
rect his objection to the athletic
program -. . . not to ROTC!

As a student who graduated
with a commission in 1964 from
an ROTC program of a different
university, I can speak from ex-
perience of its contributions.
I recently completed a three and
one-half year Army tour which
brought me into contact with peo-
ple of all walks of life, and plac-
es the breadth and width of this
country and over half-way around
the world. In retrospect, I can
truthfully say that the leader-
ship training and management
skills ROTC provided me in col-
lege outweighed any similar con-
tribution my. other
ed" courses had to offer.

I contend, therefore, that the
ROTC program not only merits
a justifiable place on the Uni-
versity curriculum, but also de-
serves to be accredited.

Barry J. Uhlenhake, student
Graduate

Why Credit
Army Class?

Editor. The Pitt News:

The issue of ROTC lies deeper
than the button episode at Forbes
Field, deeper than the inequity
of accreditation between the Col-
lege and the School of Engineer-
ing, and certainly deeper than
“deodorant, mouthwash. and
soap.”

The question is “Should an arm
of the War Department (euphem
istically called’ the Defense De-
partment) be allowed to set up its
own conditions within the Univer-
sity community?”

The Defense Department sim-
ply dictates that an ROTC instruc-
tor has Assistant Professor stat-
us. All other candidates for As-
sistant Professor status at the
University must meet require-
ments not necessary for ROTC in-
structors.

One of the purposes of ROTC
is to teach war. How does the
teaching of war fit in with the
aims of the University.

Ideally the purpose of the Uni-
versity is to teach constructive
subjects. What could be more
destructive than war‘?

Clearly a course involving
war games is not worth the same
kind of credit is an ethics course.
Three hours or ethi_cs,_cannot be

Okay. Ethics improves your
mind. Give credit for that. Give
credit for gym — it improves
your body. Why give credit for
ROTC? .

ever really gets hurt, but it can’t be changed.

THE SYSTEM continues. People try proper chan- _

nels in an attempt to change it, they try revolution
and revolt, and they try their own system. But each
time, it’s that frustration that gets to them, that stops
them. Nothing changes, no matter what they do, and
that perfection is never achieved.

The cry for change is always loud; for better-
ment, it screams out in pain. The cry for perfec-

THE WALDORF wasa small world. It nur-

pettiness and trivality by day. It didn’t die; rather,
it became diluted with the boring sameness of un-
satisfied minds.

The collegians could find no easy solution; _life
is not simple, just not that simple. It’s a place, a
position; and there is no road into it or away from
it. It’s here today, and forever gone yesterday and
tomorrow. .

“It’s ’bout time the elevator got here,” smirked
the clean faced drunk. “It’s ’bout time to go. Ihave

ROTC I Pre—Professional

SPECIAL TO THE PITT NEWS

By DR. JAMES G. ~HOLLAND
(Dr. Iames Holland is associate professor of psychology)

A major purpose of ROTC is to provide regular career officers
for the armed services. Despite the word ‘reserve’ in the program’s
title, ROTC is officially recognized as a primary source of long-term

career and regular officers, pro-‘

ducing twice as many of them as
the Army Academy. An Army
regulation states that the purpose
of ROTC is “. . . to insure a con-
tinuing flow of qualified person-
nel into the officer corps of the
Army, to conduct pre-commis-
sioning and basic military train-
ing programs, to stimulate .inter-
est in military careers, to pro-
mote appreciation of the Army,
to encourage participation in the
Reserve components of the Army,
and to assist the institution in the

development of the student to-

wards maturity.”

An undergraduate program in
the Arts and Sciences is not the
place for such pre-professional
training and recruitment. This
consideration, plus the issue of
control of the curriculum by an
outside agency, led to recent de-
cisions by several faculty bodies
to remove credit from ROTC. Of
equal concern is the University’s
history of abdication of responsi-
bility in exposing its students to
a process of systematic seduc-
tion beginning in orientation
week and continuing through the
senior year.

ROTC is largely a recruiting
program which uses, inpartner-

ship with the University, a vari-
ety of special inducements. The
major club used in getting stu.
dents into the program is the
draft. It is implied that the stu-
dent must join ROTC unless he
wants to be drafted into the low-
est ranks of the service after
graduation. This is a serious dis.
tortion of the truth, since a
large proportion of male college
graduates are never drafted. The

University sweetens, the deal by‘

giving course credit and excus-
ing the student from the usual
physical education requirement.
As a result of these inducements
the student is brought to make
early ‘decisions which can affect
his total choice of profession and
lifestyle long before such deci-

sions are necessary or desirable.

After finishing the first two
years of ROTC thestudent still
has not gained his commission;
to do so he must enter advanced
level ROTC. This requires that
he make a final decision that he
will serve two years of -active
duty after his graduation-,' re-
gardless of the size of draft quot-'
as or the nature of the nation’s
combat engagements at that fu-
ture time. He has no way of
knowing whether he will end up

THE POINT [S that this Uni‘-
versity should not have on its
campus an organizaton that uses
threat of the draft to panic the

entering students into a program?
“motivate” _,
them for military service in the

which sets out to

officer corps and gets an appar-
ently irrevocable commitment

from them between the sotpho-V

more and junior years.

These should be sufficient rea-

sons to applaud the decision of

the Council on Un‘dergraduate.Af- - ,
fairs to phase out course credit)
for ROTC. (II: should be noted

that the action was NOT to re-
move credit for either an ad-
vanced or a lower level program,
already begun by a student.)

An even ‘more important rea-  
son for the action is the need H

to maintain the aims and nature
of the academic

because its curriculum and course

materials are controlled from out I

side the University, and because

the administration of the Military.

Science Department is largely
subject to control from the U.S.
Department of Defense.

ROTC ‘courses are the only

ones at the University which ex-E
clude foreign students of certain"
nationalities or require a loyal-.

ty oath. Furthermore, faculty

teaching these courses must be_ I

military officers with security

clearance, a requirement which 3* I

clearly violates a recent Faculty

Senate decision that security clear. .
ance shall not be a condition for‘
any teaching appointment at the *

University.
THEREFORE THE FACULTY is

dropping credit for ROTC not for
political reasons, as charged, and,
not as a result of a student dem-’
onstration, as charged,' but be: .-
cause credit for ROTC is incon-I‘
sistent with academic freedom‘'_

and the independence of the. Uni.
versity curriculum from extern-

al control. Protection of the stu-3
dent’s right to modify his per.'_'

spective and plans without un.
due risk (i.e., to continue his

education in freedom) might Well V
_be an additional reason.

areas of steady improvement
has been the play‘ of the offen-

Even after the thrasing of the

they are not as strong or as big as
their opponents.”
 Against the Hurricanes, ac-
cording to Weyers, the linemen
played their best game as a ‘unit

downs of the season.

Because of injuries and the con-

position to another, it wasn’t until

Garnett ‘Reads His Guards’

Picks Up Yards, Confidence

by MARTHA HARTLE

It’s hard to find a bright
spot when your team goes
down.‘ to a‘ 48-0 defeat, but
sophomore Dave Garnett cast
a ray of hope for the Panther
running game with his fine
performance at Miami Friday
night.

Garnett got the starting nod at

tailback in Miami and the speedy_

back from Buffalo netted 51
yards in 11 carrier; the Panther
running game altogether neeted
60. Garnett lists this as his best
performance as a college gridder

and he’s confident that his improve-
ment will continue in the next
three games.

  

ffensive Line Looks Better

 

ONE OF MIAMI’S biggest offensive threats was flanker Ray Bellamy
(81) who gave the Panther secondary a hard time all night. Here, Bell-
amytries to elude George Pribish (32), Jeff Brown (47), and Frank
Gustine (19), having already left one Panther sprawling.

and Ellis are being scouted by the
pros. “Against Miami, there were
at least five scouts in the sta-
dium watching the game, and Art
and Greg,” he explained. “The
question is whether Alois and E1-
lis will become big enough to
play as the interior linemen which
the pros want.”

One thing that both Weyers and
the offensive. line is extremely
proud of is their record on punt
retum _coverag'e. Last year the
Panthers were haunted by the re-
turn of a punts-for touchdowns,
but this year the story is different,
as Weyers explains. “We’ve only
had 2 punts returned against us
for over 5 yards, and those were
only for about thirty yards. This
is a great improvement to_ say the
least, but it’s not the coach-
ing; it’s the attitude of the boys
that does it.” - -

Attitude is something that Wey-
ers doesn’t have to worry about
among his linemen. “People
may question their ability, but
not their desire,” was the way he
put it. “I’m very proud of the boys

and really pleased with their play. _

Hanging in, Weyer’s office in
big red letters is the linemen’s
credo. “Take off . . Hit the spot . .

. .Scramble.” -This is something
that the linemen will have to ad-
here to this Saturday when they
face Notre Dame, for as Weyers
put it, “They certainly have their

Picture credits were omitt-
ed from all the football photos
in Monday's edition of the Pitt
News; Credit for all three Miami
game pictures should have been
attributed to photography edi-
tor Bob Koenig.

“I was reading my guards
much better Friday night than I
had been in the past,” explained
Garnett. “Now I’m watching the
holes more instead of the ball.
This comes from. playing more
and I’ve been working hard on it
at practice too.

“I look to do a lot better the
rest of the season,” he continued,
“If the blacking’s'as good as it
was in Miami. Our offensive
line did a good job Friday night.
We could move the ball on the
ground. But once Miami got so
far ahead of us, we couldn’t use
our running game. We had to to
to the air and they completely
stopped our passing.”

Experience has been a key fac-
tor in holding back Garnett’s
maturing as a runner. An outstand-
ing track star, he only played one
year of football in high school
and since coming to the Pan-
thers, he’s been plagued by the
injury bug. /

“I didn’t get much out of my
freshman year,” he explained.
“I was still doing things wrong.
Up to now, I’ve been getting the
holes, but I haven’t been able to
read them. That comes with ex-
perience.

“Injuries have also set me back
quite a bit. I still have a stretched
ligament in my knee and a spur
in my ankle, but they’re not both-
ering me too much now.”

team. Garnett explains that track

in no way hinders his football work.

“Track helps me more than it
hinders. It keeps me in shape all
year round. _It keeps my legs in
shape.

“My speed isn’t really that
great of an asset in football,”
he continued, “beacuse I don’t
rely on my speed till I get out
in the open.”

Garnett and fellow sophomore
Dennis Ferris give the Pan-
thers depth and‘ talent at the tail-
back slot when both are healthy.

‘Garnett likes the idea of compe-
tition. »

“It gives you confidence in
yourself to know‘ there’s some-
one on the bench as good as you,”
he explained. “Competition makes
me work harder, and when I’m
out on the field I can feel I real-

208 pound speedster has set
personal goals, but he’s not ready
to make them public. “I can’t say
what I expect of myself as yet.
I just have to wait till next year
for that. And if I make it here in
"college ball, I would like to play
in the pros.”

But Dave admits that’s a long
way off. Right now he’s thinking
about this week and Notre Dame.
“I think I’ll be starting; at least
Ihope so.”

Freshman football coach Carl Kokor has instilled in his

squad an element that has been

“This is a close, spirited team,” beamed Kokor. “I enjoy working
with these boys, and I know that whether we win or lose, they’ll give

100 per cent.

The Cubs already have more inovations in practice strategies.

“We have our own special de-
fensive unit,” said Kokor with a
big grin on his face. ‘-‘They’re
like a clique; they always stay
together.” .

Kokor’s “new defensive unit”
consists of eight frosh gridders

players. Their new job, however,

has no effects on their status in
other drills.

“These kids keep whipping and
hollering throughout practice,”
said Kokor. “When I want them
in there, I call for the Jungle
Cats.” ’

Kokor developed the Jungle
Cats idea to keep his players con-
stantly busy, as well as to build
team morale. “It might sound
trite,” admitted Kokor, “but these
kids like it.” '

The Jungle Cats and the rest
of the frosh gridders will have to
give more than 100 per cent Fri-
day night against the Little Lions
of Penn State.

“I’ve been talking to the Penn
State people,” said Kokor, “and
they told me we don’t have a
chance. They have a very strong

, team, but don’t sell us short.”

Kokor expects Penn State to dis-
play.a tough attack. In their only
other game, the Little Lions romp-
ed over West Virginia, 49-7.

“Their quarterback is supposed
to be really something,” said Kokor
“He’s supposed to be big and
strong, like Roman Gabriel.”

_ Kokor’s squad will also be see-
ing a Charlie Pittmann type in

well balanced attack.

Hagner Sets Goals H igh

by BILL NAAB

A winner must be a believer and an optimist. Freshman
harrier Bob Hagner, therefore, qualifies.

Hagner feels that the varsity cross country squad is a very strong
Eastern team. Bob remarked, “Thefreshmen were second in the East
last year, and Richey will always keep us near the top.” he predicts
Georgetown, Villanova, Penn State, and Pitt to be the outstanding teams

in the East.

In just two years, Hagner be-
lieves that the varsity should be
the best in the East. “I’m hoping
for a National Championship.
We.ve got lots of great potential
and plenty of depth. The guys are
still fhaturing, and everyone is
pointing for the national’s.”
Bob reasoned. So great is the depth
that he feels, even though he is
the only freshman harrier on
scholarship, he’ll have.to go all
out to makethe traveling squad
next season.

Hagner also expressed abund-
ant optimism, concerning the
coaches. He said, “They’re
(Banner and Meckley) both great

coaches. They’re as enthusiastic"

as we _are for this season and
seasons to come.”

As for Hagner’s current physi-
cal condition, he said, “My back
feels okay. I hope it doesn’t
strain again. Right now, though I
haven’t had enough competition
More than a
month ago, he hurt his back in
practice and irritated the strain
when he continued to run.

Hagner also pointed to the Can- -

isius and Penn State meets as
the most important freshman
meets of the season.

“Canisius was our first big test.
Some of the best freshmen in the
East completed. The number and
caliber of runners was ex-
ceptional,” Hagner explained.

Bob is, impatiently awaiting
the Penn State meet this Sa-
turday. He stated, “Greg Freder-
icks, who almost came to Pitt,
runs for the Penn State team.”
Hagner mentioned that in his
final two years of high school,
he and Fredericks exchanged
hotly-contested victories.

Harriers Set
For Penn St.
On Saturday

Penn State’s highly regard-
ed cross country squad visits
coach Jim Banner’s harriers
Saturday morning (11:00 a.

' m.) at Schenley park. Banner

regards the Penn State con-
test as the toughest dual meet
of the season. .

Banner remarked, “Penn State
has four seniors and one real
good sophomore.” He sigled out
Steve Gentry and Ray Smith as
the stars of the Nittany Lion
squad. Smith was the New York
State mile champion in high
school, and Gentry was a former
PIAA record-holder in the mile.
Gentry transferred from Villan-
ova a year ago.

Villanova has been the only_
school to upset Penn State in a-

dual meet the past two seasons.
Last season the Lions knocked off
Banner’s harriers 15-45. However,
Banner is hoping that his runners
can race better than they have
anytime this season in order to
defeat the rugged Penn State
squad. ’

He stated that his squad has
been concentrating on

tany Lion clash. Banner also
remarked that junior Paul Zink
is expected to run Saturday’ de-

r -‘spite an injured achilles tendon. .

Bob also commented that har-
rier, Dave Cobb, defeated Fre-
dericks in his junior year. Jud-
ging from the county meets in
his high school days, Hagner re-
marked, “He’s a good competitor.
Both Dave and I are looking for-
ward to the meet. I hope to be in
the best possible shape.”

Hagner comes from Exeter
High School in Reading, Pa. In
his junior year, he ran tenth in
state cross country competition.
In his senior year, Bob finished
second in the state and his high
school conquered the state cham-
pionship. Bob also remarked that
Exeter had a winning streak of
sixty straight victories in county
competition, stretching back to
1963. Moreover, when one dis-
plays Hagner’s desire and opti-
mism, winning becomes history.

Bob. Quinlin Leaves Boot/ers,
Becomes Bemis’ Eighth Loss.

by ED CONLEY

Bob Quinlin has qut the soccer team.

The junior kicker made his decision Mon-
day night prior to the team’s practice session.
He stated “personal reasons” for his depart-
ure. A

But Quinlin isn’tHthe first of Leo Bemis’ players
to call it quits. Angelo Spirtes, Pete Northey, and Ian
Baguley made identical decisions last week. Spirtes
and Nothey have not played much this fall, but
Baguley had been the starting left‘ wing until he
suffered a leg injury a few weeks ago. Since that
time Ba guley had been dropped to the second team.

Quinlin is the big shocker to Bemis, though.
Just minutes before hearing the news of the booter’s
departure Bemis related, “I’ll try to use him up at
the inside line position as much as I can in the last
four games. He takes the quick shots.”

With Quinlin gone, all Bemis could say was: “I
was really quite surprised. The coach doesn’t know
everything, I guess.” ' .

The coach doesadd that he believes Quinlin’s
reasons were personal, just as the others were. He
rejects the thought that the athletes quit because of
the horrible season that is still in progeess.

“I think they could have quit sooner if it was be-
cause of the losses,” he mentions. '

   
    
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
 

“And I don’t think anyone else will quit, either,’.’._
he continued. The ones that wanted to, have.”— 
The other players, the 17 that remain on the ros-_;.
ter, held a meeting before going to the Monday
scrimmage. f 1
“They talked things out; this was good,” the;
coach remarked. “They expect to win some games‘.
“Actually, they’re up despite the quittings. _I.
think it’s fired them up as much as it could,”‘he
continued to stress his point. —

But, can some thing like this “fire up” a, team?’
They have lost one of their biggest scoring threats;__
something a team that has scored only four goals in
seven games can't afford to lose. The bench con-
tinues to grow smaller and smaller, and those losses
w_on’t go away. _ ’ .

“Sure, I think we’ve weathered-a lot this year,”_
said Bemis, “but we realize this and we're not going
to let it get us down. We expect to win three of ouigi.
last four games.” ‘

This prediction would have a hard time ‘getting’
good odds, however. The opposition in the final
games will be‘ rough-teams like Penn State and"
Akron will soon be aiming at the booters.  <

Bemis shouldn’t have to worry about these»
teams too much, though. All the damage that can
be done in one seasonvhas been done.\ i .
