sos Student Cabinet

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

K 3 Pitt News Staffwriter

Some 750 evening students are
eligible to cast their votes this week
in SGS Student Cabinet elections to
elect either Debbie Alpert or Kathy
Stevens as president and four of
the eight candidates for cabinet.

Running for general cabinet

positions are Ron Alexander, Dick
Baird, Kerry Clancy, Rose Dolfi,
Elbert Johnson, Rick Markovitz,
Bob Paylo and Cheryl Peck.
The presidential candidate and four
cabinet candidates garnering the
most votes will compose the SGS
Student Cabinet form April 1, 1978
to March 31, 1980.

.:fx ,

John Hankey, chairman of the
cabinet’s elections committee said
students enrolled in SGS with a
current ID and validation card can
vote at polling places on the ground
ﬂoor of the Cathedral or on first
ﬂoor of David Lawrence Hall from
5:15 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday
through Thursday. A polling place
at the Pitt South Hills campus will
be open from 5:15 p.m. to 8:30
p.m. today. '

The SGS Student. Cabinet
administers the $70,000 collected
in activity fees from the SGS
student body. Activities organized

  Elections This Week

by the cabinet include an annual
holiday children’s party, an annual
picnic, handling of course com-
plaints, free Xeroxing service,
football tickets at half price, a
scholarship for SGS students and a
student health survey.

Regarding an allegation that
Alpert offered payment to a former
editor of the Night Times to rewrite
and publish a story concerning her,
Hankey said the matter had been
investigated.

“The election committee did
receive a request to review that
matter and we did,” said Hankey.
“From the authority the elections
committee has, which entails
running elections, we found nothing
that was in violation of our rules.”

Hankey also predicted an im-
proved turnout for the election,
which only attracted 7 percent of
the eligible voters last year.
“There’s a good selection of
candidates to choose from this year
and for that reason I think there
will be a good turnout,” said
Hankey.

Those candidates elected this
week will replace the current
student cabinet of president John
A. Della Valle, Kathy Gubala,
Robert Hilinski, Mary Synan
Pollick and Jackie Woulitich.

Even during the most interesting of classes, one can find a break in the
action to engage in conversation with a neighbor. with rapidly advan-
cing finals, however, one had better listen to the prof rather than the

person next door.

Search Begins
For Marshall

Replacement

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

A 10-member committee has
been formed to review candidates
for the position of College of Arts
and Sciences Dean to be vacated by
Robert Marshall this summer.

The committee consisting of eight

faculty members and two students,
will present its findings to
Chancellor Posvar, who will then
appoint Marshall’s successor.
 -. University Senate guidelines
stipulate that a search committee
must submit to the Chancellor the
names of three to six recommended
candidates, but the committee must
not indicate any preferences.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
associate Dean Elizabeth Baranger
is serving as chairman of the

committee. _
Faculty members on the commit-

tee are Lloyd Bond of the
psychology department; Ivy McMa-
nus of biological sciences; Benjamin
Hicks, French; Robert Doherty,
history; G.A. Stewart, physics;
Josephine Schaefer, English; Alex-
ander Nehamas, philosophy, and
Burkhart Holzner, sociology.

Eighty-three percent of all Pitt students consume alcohol
in degrees varying from moderate to heavy, according to a
recent survey conducted by a University task force.

The survey, conducted by the Task Force on Responsible
Alcohol use, headed by Rabbi Joseph Levine in conjunction
with other campus groups, sought to examine the drinking
habits of Pitt students; their values as to the use or abuse of
alcoholic beverages, and their behavior while under the
inﬂuence of alcohol. The survey was also aimed at
determining the depth of knowledge on the subject of
alcohol among the students, in order to give the task force a

*~._direction in which to head future educational programming
Ljsn the matter.

Last November, members of the Peer Medical Aide

pfggfam (an arm of Student Government’s Medical Action
Committee) adminjgtgffd the surveys to 635 undergraduate
and graduate students. The results §'v'3.'C F?°ent1Y Cfmpiled
by student health educator Bob La Civita and W'éSi3I’_“
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC) social worker Sally

Kincer-Belotti.

In their interpretation of the results, Kincer-Belotti and
LaCivita initially noted social values have changed over the
past decade, from the 1960’s when drug use increased
among college students and alcohol was considered
“socially acceptable,” to the present, when alcohol abuse
and related problems become major concerns.

Of the 635 survey participants, 6 percent classified
themselves as heavy, problem drinkers. The statistic
coincides closely with national norms that state 4-7 percent
of any population has a drinking problem. The problem
usually occurs in the heavy drinker category, but may also
be found in other categories because, according to
Kincer-Belotti many people tend to underestimate their
drinking patterns. A

The survey also dealt with student concern with the
consequences of their drinking. According to the survey, 66
percent said they were not concerned with the
consequences, while 33 percent indicated they were worried
about the long-range effects of drinking.

Kincer-Belotti noted that the largest inﬂuences on an
ind{vj;jg3l’s drinking habits are family and friends. In
response to a quesﬁgn 3._sking whether or not these students

had family or other acquaintances with drinking problems,
slightly more than half responded “yes.” p

Concern for the consequences of alcohol use by others was
demonstrated by a large majority of the students who
responded negatively to the survey’s statement: “It’s
nobody’s business how much someone else drinks as long as
he or she doesn’t bother anybody.’ ’ Sixty-nine percent of the
students believed drinking should in no way interfere with
grades or other academic responsibilities.

The task force also sought to examine reasons for a
student’s desire to consume alcoholic beverages. Findings
indicated there were no vast differences between the
reasons given by the various class divisions. The most
common reason students offered were to feel more
sociable, more confident and to cheer up and to ease
problems.

Part of the survey dealt with situations experienced while
under the inﬂuence of alcohol. I The experiences most
frequently reported were blackouts (memory lapses) and the
use of drugs with alcohol.

JAN MEDOFF

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pit_t News Staff Writer _
Plans for a centralized programming agency here

arelbeingconsidered by the Student Government
Board and the Office of Student Activities.

The Pitt Union Council, according to board
member Jan Medoff, would coordinate campus-wide
programming for Student organizations.

“Programming at Pitt is not really up to par,"
Medoff said. “Over the past couple of years there
have been various programs organized by different
organizations.”

Medoff said the agency has to be approved by the

SGB, but believes it has enough board support for

passage.

SGB president Josh Baylson termed the effort
“collective programming.”

“You can serve students much more effectively,"
Baylson said. “You can get a larger, more varied
amount of students involved."

The council would consist of six different
committees; Cultural Arts, Lecture, Special
Interest, Music, Visual and Recreation. Each

committee will have a minimum of-ten student

members. One person will be éiiCS§3H as Overall
chairman. ~

“He will be in charge of coordinating all the
committees and act as a spokesman for the whole
programming council,” ‘Medoff said.

Current student programming is handled by the
SGB.

According to Medoff, the council will be funded
jointly by the SGB and the Office of Student
Activities. The SGB will contribute between $100,000
and $120,000 while the Office of Student Activities
will add approximately $40,000.

Medsoff said that while many organizations will be
contributing programming ideas to the council, they
will retain the option of planning independent
programs.

Committee chairmen will be recruited at the end of
this month, and an interview process for volunteers
of the various committees will begin tentatively April
1

“A centralized agency is definately what we
need." Medoff _said. “It will totally revolutionize
programming here at Pitt."

Alcohol Poll Results Are Released

(Continued from Page 1)
Some 49 percent of the self-

proclaimed heavy drinkers had
experienced a blackout in the
September - November survey

period while 19 percent of those
considered moderate drinkers
admitted to having experienced a
blackout, which is a sign that an
individual has consumed enough
alcohol to alter the normal
functioning of the brain’s learning
and memory centers. Blackouts are
considered to be one of the initial
warning signals of an impending
drinking problem.

It was also reported that while "an
average of 34 percent of the
freshmen and upperclassmen
mixed alcohol with drugs—a
combination that may lead to
death—a smaller percentage (26
percent of graduate students mixed
the two substances.

Another area touched upon in
the survey was the frequency of
studens drinking while operating a

motor vehicle. It was shown that
graduate students drive under the
inﬂuence on more occassions (32
pecent reported that they did so
anywhere from ﬁve to nine times
between September and Novem-
ber) while 25 percent of the
freshmen and 41 percent of the
upperclassmen admitted to having
done so during the three-month
test period.

Considering that the leading
cause of death among those under
the age of 21 is automobile
accidents, we found these statistics
to be very important,” La Civita
said.

Both LaCivita and Kincer-
Belotti were pleased and surprised
that Pitt students were so
knowledgeable on the subject of
alcohol and alcoholism. A 10-ques-
tion true-false quiz included with
the survey showed an average score
of 76 percent.

In addition to probing student
drinking habits, the task force also

attempted to receive some general
feedback as to whether students
beleived there is a serious drinking
problem on campus and if so, what
direction might be taken in seeking
solutions. A vast majority of the

students said there deﬁnitely is a ‘

drinking problem and recom-
mended more stringent enforce-
ment of state liquor laws and the
development of more counseling,
hotline and educational services.

LaCivita said he was very pleased
with cooperation received from the
students involved in the survey and
the question that was subsequently
raise.d He added he would like to
conduct a similar survey perhaps
next year.

“Our goal is not to cause a total
behavior change or to close down all
of the bars in Oakland,” said task
force member Tim Snyder, repre-
senting the Office of Residence Life.
“We just want to help students to

make good decisions involving the

use of alcohol.”

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Better Programming

A centralized programming committee to plan the activities
scheduled by campus organizations has been proposed by the
Student Government Board. The basic organization of the
suggested committee appears workable.

Programming would be accomplished by committees operating
in six different subject areas. These separate subject committees
would be supervised by a general chairman who would coordinate
the activities of the six committees and act as a spokesman for the

 

, total programming committee.

This design allows for programming in all possible areas of in-
terest on the campus and eliminates possible overlapping of ac-
tivities currently scheduled by Pitt’s various autonomous student
organizations. An option» allowing individual organizations to
schedule activities if they wish promises to preserve the right of
separate groups to initiate programming when they feel a void
exists in the central committee’s schedule.

Besides promising to give an organized method of programming
to Pitt’s student groups, a centralized committee may be a vehicle
to improve the quality of happenings on the Pitt campus. Curren-
tly, Pitt of fers a paucity of events to students.

This year programs sponsored by student activity fees has been
slight except for speakers such as Henry Kyemba, Jane Fonda and
George McGovern, and the inevitable weekend movie sponsored by
the Franklin Pangborn Film Society. When compared to a Pen-
nsylvania state college which sponsored performances by Hall and
Oates, Stephen Stills, Stanley Clarke, Steve Martin and Al Stewart,
speeches by Morris Udall, Dick Gregory and Vincent Price and a
multitude of minor events in the academic year 1976 to 1977, Pitt’s
student sponsored events seem nonexistant. Considering that such
events help round a student’s experience, it is indeed sad that such a
dearth of them exists at Pitt.

The plan for a centralized programming committee can resurrect
the SGB’s Programming Committee, which died last fall. With a
$140,000 to $160,000 budget, the committee should be able to offer
a decent schedule of events to be enjoyed by Pitt students.

Letters to the Editor

Pitt Values Secular over Religious?

As a devout Christian, I ﬁnd it
appalling that the administration is
insensitive to the obligations of
Catholics during the high holidays
of Easter.

Speciﬁcally, I am speaking of
holding mandatory classes on Holy
Thursday, Good Friday and Easter
Monday. Considering the admini-
stration’s deference toward other
minorities that indeed comprise a
much smaller percentage of the
student body and faculty, i.e.,

Martin Luther King Day,vI ﬁnd it
extremely inconsistent and pre-
judicial that allowances are not
made for these holidays.

It is common knowledge that this
holiday season for those of the
Christian faith, is the holiest of all
seasons. I appeal to the administra-
tion in the name of many Christians
attending this University that this
injustice be corrected.

The administration does not

realize that students would like to
spend this holiest of holidays with
their families. There is no
allowance for travel. It should be
noted that Thanksgiving, a reli-
gious holiday, was given off, and
this shows a major inconsistency in
policy-making.

The administration obviously
puts more emphasis on secular
holidays than on religious holidays.

the Constitutional Convention;
1861, the start of the Civil War, and

Deal.

Editor's Note: This is the ﬁrst of a
series of columns on the events of 1968,
their historical perspective and their im-
pact in 1978.

By R. DAVID TIVE
This year we are commemorating

the tenth anniversary of a year
which may well be looked upon by
future historians in the same way
that we look upon those dates just
mentioned. The year 1968 was a
watershed in American history,
one whose signiﬁcance is not yet

Every society or culture goes.
through various stages in its
development. These historical
stages may, for example, mark the
change from an agrarian economy
to an industrial one, or from one
political system to another. Often, it

is possible to put a specific date on
such a change, particularly in the
case where on dramatic event or
series of events highlight it.

Many such dates stand out in
history. One is 48 B'.C., the
ascension of Julius Caesar and the
end of the Roman republic. Another
obvious one is 1066, the Norman
conquest of England. A third would
be 1871, the unification of
Germany. American history is also
ﬁlled with such dates. The most
obvious one is 1776, but others

fully appreciated, and may not be
for many years.

There were five major events in
1968, each of which, when taken by
itself, could be considered a
landmark, but when taken as a
whole, drastically tore at the fabric
of American society. These events
are: the forced retirement of
Lyndon Johnson from the Presiden-
cy; the assassination of Martin
Luther King; the assassination of
Robert Kennedy; the Chicago
Democratic Convention, and the
election of Richard Nixon.

Few people, except those who
were very young (then), can
honestly say that they were
unaffected by those events. For
those of us, such as myself, who
werein college at the time, each of
the ﬁve stands out with stark clarity,
and together they represent a
crucible in which many of us formed
our ideas about ourselves and the
society in which we live.

This month is the anniversary of
the ﬁrst of the ﬁve events, the
forced retirement of Lyndon
Johnson from the Presidency. The
instrument of that retirement was

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

as unlikely a person as anyone could
imagine, Eugene McCarthy. His
grass roots campaign against the
Vietnam War, culminating in his
“victory” over Johnson in the New

‘Hampshire Democratic primary not

only forced Johnson out of office,
but changed the nature of American
politics.

The success of the McCarthy
campaign demonstrateda number
of things to America. The main one
is that a small, tightly-knit and
dedicated group of people, running
a campaign geared to one issue
only, can have an impact on
American politics. McCarthy and
his followers really had only one
issue, the Vietnam War. As long as
he stuck to that, hegained support.
When he began to branch out, he
got into trouble.

We saw the same phenomenon
repeated in the McGovern cam-
paign in 1972. As long as McGovern

stuck to the issue of the Vietnam
War, he was okay. Where he met

his downfall was in trying to deal
with such issues as welfare reform
and the economy. .

We are seeing other echoes of the
McCarthy campaign this year.
Conservatives are promising an
attack directed against those
senators who voted for the first
Panama Canal Treaty. Leaders of
the movement to ratify the Equal
Rights Amendment are vowing to
work for the defeat of those state
legislators throughout the country
who are opposed to the amendment.
Both of these efforts ﬁnd their
origins in the McCarthy campaign.
They are both small, one-issue
movements that are trying to have
an impact on American politics.

Another legacy of McCarthy is
the involvement of young people in
politics. While the level of
participation of students in politics
today is nowhere near what it was in
1968, there have been some
permanent changes resulting from

McCarthy’s “Kiddie Korp.” The
most obvious is the lowering of the
voting age from 21 to 18. That came
about as a direct result of the
evidence of 1968 that students and
other young people could be a
signiﬁcant force
campaign.

The third major thing that the
McCarthy campaign demonstrated
to America is that an incumbant
President could be beaten even in

the ‘era of the imperial presidency. ‘

Although Lyndon Johnson didn’t
really “lose” the election, he was
beaten since he had wanted to be
re-elected. That was the ﬁrst time
since 1932 that an incumbant
president had been beaten, and
probably the ﬁrst time in over a

in a political

century that one had been beaten by
his own party.

Once again, the lessons of 1968
are being lived out today. The
Reagan campaign in 1976 attempt-
ed todo‘ the same thing to Gerald
Ford that McCarthy did to Johnson,
and almost succeeded. There are
many indications that the Democra-
tic Party in 1980 may be the scene of
another similar attempt. What was
not thought possible before 1968,
and was hardly ever attempted, is
now becoming more and more
common.

Not everything that we learned ’

from McCarthy made us feel good.
His eventual poor showing demon-
strated once more something that
the two Stevenson campaigns in
1952 and 1956 had indicated:
America was not ready to accept an
“intellectual” as President.

McCarthy came across as too
high brow. He wrote poetry. He
probably couldn’t be trusted.
America in 1968, with education as
one of the fastest growing societal
institutions, and more people than
ever going to school at one level or
another, still was not ready for a
President who was “too smart.” It
did, after all, elect Richard Nixon.

The forcing of Lyndon Johnson
into an early retirement over the
issue of the Vietnam War and the
dramatic, though limited, success
of the McCarthy campaign, were
the first major landmark events of
1968. They may not have been the
most signiﬁcant, but they did have a
great deal of impact at the time and,
has been seen, continue to do so
today.

Next: The Assassination of Martin
LutherKing.

Colored eggs are familiar the
world over as symbols of the Easter
season. Among the Slavs, eggs
have long been decorated as
reminders of the new birth that
Easter brings, and used to adorn
baskets full of scrumptious foods
blessed in church on Holy Saturday,
foods that will break a long Lenten
fast as Easter Sunday’s feast.

Of all the Slavs, it is the
Ukrainians most celebrated for their
art of intricate egg decorating both
in Europe and the Americas. Their
eggs are known as “pysanky,” a
name derived from their verb
“pysaty,” meaning to write. And

EATURES

quite literally, that’s what they
do—write on eggs with wax.

The art of pysanky, long familiar
to Pittsburgher’s, now is becoming
familiar to many Pitt students as
well. The Ukrainian Students
Organization, a new group on
campus, comprised of Ukrainian-
American students, has been
sponsoring pysanky classes every
Friday afternoon for the past ﬁve
weeks at the Slavic Department in
the Loeffler Building.

Painting Slavic Easter eggs in intricate designs is a unique art.

Last week, Giant Eagle stores
across the country began stocking
generic products—-items packaged
in plain white wrappers which are
sold at a discount price (up to ﬁfty
percent less than brand name
products) because of selective
buying in large quantities.

Generics--Same

Giant Eagle admits there is a
difference in quality between
generic and brand name products-
variances in color and uniformity of
size.

A comparison of prices of cans of
green beans at Oakland’s Giant
Eagle on Atwood Sreet revealed
that the generic brand offered the
greatest savings: a 16 ounce can of

“We started the classes to expose
pysanky to those who aren ’t familiar
with it,” said Rick Sobocinski,
president of the 25-member organ-
ization. “We also teach it to
students of Ukrainian background
as part of their culture.”

The classes have been attended
by approximately 35 people, and
have been such a success they will
be continued every Friday until
Eastern Orthodox Easter, April 30.

The process it a long and tedious
one, taking several hours to
complete. A writing stylus with a
small copper cone, called a
“kitska,” is heated over a candle,
then dipped in beeswax. The stylus
then is drawn across the surface of
the egg, the hot wax covering part of
it with a thin black line. Whatever
the wax covers will remain white
when the wax is removed.

The egg goes through a series of
dyes in order of lightest to darkest,
ranging from yellow to black. After
each color, wax is applied to cover
whatever is desired. The wax will
preserve each covered color before
it goes into the next darkest color.

When the complete design has
been covered and dyed, the wax is
removed over a candle ﬂame, and
the brilliantly colored, intricate
design is revealed.

Pysanky are considered works of
art, and are not to be eaten (the dyes
are poisonous). Therefore, they are
varnished upon completion to give
them a glazed, ceramic look.

“No two pysanky are alike, and
the designs vary from region to
region, even village to village in the

Ukraine,” said Karen Sabolosky,
the club’s vice president. “Many of
the patterns used were once early
pagan symbols, but they all have
been adapted to Christianity, and
symbolize many concepts in the
Christian Church.”

Aside from the eggs adorning the
blessed baskets, they are also
exchanged among friends, relatives
and lovers. One tradition dictates
that on Easter Sunday, girls give
their best egg to a man they are
interested in to hint at a possible
relationship.

All the supplies necessary to
complete a pysanka are supplied
free of charge at the classes, and are
also for sale to those students who

Colorful Easter Eggs Are Slavic Art

would like to pursue the art further.
Those pysanky made in the class
thus far can be viewed, along with
others in a Ukrainian Easter
display, at the visitor’s center in the
Cathedral of Learning.

The classes have certainly served
their proposed purpose at Pitt. They
have educated many students about
pysanky, and have revived a bit of
Ukrainian culture among Ukrainian
students.

“Culture is something you can’t
abandon just because you're in
America,” Sabolosky said. “lt’s
something you should perpetuate
all the time.”

The Ukrainian Students Organ-
ization has done just that.

More often than not, these fancy Easter eggs are not eaten.

Quality as House Brands

generic green beans sells for 19
cents while eight ounces of Green
Giant beans sells for 24 cents, and
Libby’s beans cost 27 cents per
eight ounce can.

A comparison of the nutritional
information printed on cans of
Green Giant and generic beans
offered some surprises. For each
eight ounce serving, both products
were identical in calories, carbo-
hydrates, protein and fat. Both
servings contained the same
percentage of vitamin C, thiamin,
calcium and iron. However, the
generic brand has higher amounts
of vitamin A, niacin, and magne-
sium. Therefore, nutritionally
speaking, the generic brand is
superior to a name brand product.

A comparison betweeen generic
and Green Giant green beans for
variances in taste, appearance and
quality proved some interesting
things as well. While the Giant
beans were of uniform proportions
and appeared slightly more physi-
cally appealing, as they were a
brighter shade of green, there was
no difference in taste. The salt level
in both brands seemed similar and
there was a comparative level of
liquid.

Generic strawberry preserves, at
89 cents for a two pound jar, were
tested for taste. There were no

lapses in quality between the
generic brand and Smucker’s
strawberry preserves which sell for
$1.27 per 12 ounce jar.

Currently Giant Eagle is selling
generic products of the following
items: canned potatoes, green
beans, corn, tomatoes, peas,
mushrooms, grape jelly and straw-
berry preserves, tomato sauce,
macaroni and cheese dinners, rice
napkins, paper towels, dishwashing
liquids, shortening and salad oil.

 

Oakland’s Giant Eagle are placed
close to the entrance, some
products are scattered throughout
the store.

“The main thing is, they give the
customer an alternative,” said a
Giant Eagle employee. Pitt students
are taking advantage of the
bargains.

“I found the generic products I
bought to be of the same quality as
the house brands (Food Club),”
said Pitt senior Jim Morrison.

“I can’t ﬁnd any difference,”
said a junior. “Sure, there are a few

differences in size and coloring, but
if it’s uniformity you want, you
might as well buy plastic replicas.”

One thing that puzzles most
people is the distinction between
house brands (Food Club at Giant
Eagle, other supermarkets name
their house brand after their chain
name) and generic brands. First,
there is the distinctive white label of
the generic brands with no photos of
drawings of the product inside.
And, according to a Giant Eagle
spokesman, the generic brands are
of lesser quality.

Garfunkel Shines at Heinz

ByKEITHBRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Twenty-two years ago he re-
corded his ﬁrst record, sixteen
years ago he cut his ﬁrst album,
seven years ago he quit touring.
Monday night he took the stage of
Pittsburgh’s Heinz Hall on his first
tour since the split with his poet
buddy Paul Simon.

Art Garfunkel and his new ﬁve
person back-up group brought both
the “Sounds Of Silence” and the
“Breakaway” hits of this
“Wonderful World” to life for the
welcoming crowd. Harlon Roth
played an electric twelve string for
the only instrumentation on
Garfunkel’s rendition of “To
Emily”.

“Crying In My Sleep” introduced
Leah Kunkel on vocals with Art. A
slightly different arrangement than
the album’s version, the tempo was
the same but the sound was a little
softer with only twelve string and
keyboard for accompanyment.

Leah is strong and can harmonize
with Art’s voice like an echo.

After a seven year layoff from the
road, Garfunkel’s stage mannersim
showed a touch of nervousness.
During his short introductions he
would fumble with the second
button of his shirt and then decided
to leave it unbuttoned. On
“Scarborough Fair” he started
sitting on a stool,two bars into the
song it was evident that he was
more comfortable standing. His
voice, however hasn’t suffered but
he’s kept that busy.

During “Bye, Bye” the band got
to show a little more range with
percussion tapping on wood, guitar
playing with a country ﬂavor, and
some variations with Ms. Kunkel on
keyboards. A touch of calypso
tempo came to light with the old
favorite “Cecilia”.

The percussionist, Harold
Alexander, did more than play
drums. His work on Steven Bishop’s
“Hideaway” featured delicate
ringing of. chimes. A spotlight
performance from cellist Chung
Yung Lee on “All My Life's
Laughter” brought a robust yet

cushioned tone to Jimmy Webb’s
song.

John Jarvis played the piano for
the tune that won the Brittannia
Award, an award’ given only every
twenty-ﬁve years for the ﬁnest
single piece of recorded music. The
song; “Bridge' Over Troubled
Water.” Garfunkel’s voice was the
only music necessary, it went up, up
again, and then high enough to
pierce the ceiling of the hall.

Roaring applause and a deserved
standing ovation followed.
Garfunkel stood at centerstage, the
stage darkened, the crowd quieted,
two footlights shown up on his face,
he sang “Hello, darkness my old
friend...” Another roar from the
crowd and another memory stirred
to the tune of “Sounds of Silence.”

The show ended all too soon,
seventeen songs in total, all
ﬁnished within an hour and a half.
After waiting for seven years, great
expectations build in an audiences
mind, not everything could be
played that could start to ﬁll them.
Everything that was done though,
was done well with perfect sound.

Art Garfunkel was in Pittsburgh Monday night, singing some new songs and

old favorites.

Hoffman Can ’t Save “Straight Time”

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Straight Time
Directed by Ulu Grasbard

Not even Dustin Hoffman can
save a movie like “Straight Time,”
playing at the King’s Court
Theater.

Hoffman, who won acclaim for his
performances in “The Graduate”
and the recent “Marathon Man,”
does everything possible with Alvin
Sargent’s and Edward Bunker’s
pointless script—he is good as Max
Dembo, a parolee who tries to make
an honest living in brutal Los
Angeles.

But the dialogue is so bad, the
character motivation so lacking,
that the movie still falls ﬂat.

Typical dialogue consists of
mumbles, stutters and overlapping
lines between two characters. At
times, this air of uneasiness and
confusion ﬁts the scene—such as
the ﬁrst phone conversation be-
tween Hoffman and his new-found
girlfriend Jenny (Theresa Russell).
Usually, however, the actors grope
for lines and pause for an

awkwardly long period of time, as if
they don’t know just how to use the
material the two writers have given
them.

Character motivation is almost
non-existant. Hoffman’s Dembo
forgets his plans to go straight in
pursuit of robbing stores, banks and
jewelry_shops—all because he was
needlessly arrested so that he would
tell police the identify of the junkie
(Gary Bussey) who ﬁxed in his
room.

Dembo’s only reason to escape
his parole ofﬁcer (horribly acted by
M. Emmet Walsh) is to avoid being
sent to a halfway house afterwards.
Why that is so terrible is never
explained.

Hoffman’s character isn't the
only one that suffers from lack of
motivation. Russell's Jenny is
never developed beyond the
cardboard free-spirit she is made
out to be. Russell, along with
Bussey, act well, but are stereo-
typed and seldom break the mold
Sargent and Bunker formed for
them.

And so, with Dembo pillaging

(Continued on Page 10)

Forty-ﬁve minutes later than
designed, Jerry Garcia, two friends
from the “Grateful Dead,” a
couple of new faces and Maria
Muldaur joined talents in a
rendition of James Taylor's “How
Sweet It Is.”

The Jerry Garcia Band, while not
playing all of the songs of the past,
did play in the style and
mannerisms of the Grateful Dead.
The arrangement of Taylor’s tune
took on the shifting rhythms and
liquid silver sounds of a song
touched by Garcia.

“Cats under the Stars” is the
band’s new album and a ten minute
performance of the title track
featured the vocals of “Deadhead”
Donna Godchaux and “Midnight At
The Oasis” Muldaur. These two
Voices merge and . form the
strongest union since the A.F. of L.

After a marathon version of

ARTS

with bass man John Kahn. Garcia
ran his ﬁngers over the frets faster
than a ﬂy ﬂips its wings, but Kahn
stood his ground with rumbles from
the bowels of his bass. The
kinky-haired guitarist countered
with a string-bending run that bent
the notes around the corner and
down Liberty Avenue. Kahn was

starting to weaken under pressure,
but Keith Godchaux added support
from his position at the keyboards,
punching notes high and hard as
well as low and subtle. Garcia was
stunned. He wiped his hands on his
black T-shirt, then reverting to pure
power, belted out fast, rock-hard
chords that overrode the rest of the
band. That set the mood for the
evening.

Six songs into the presentation
the band took a break that would

last a half an hour. At that point it
became obvious it would be another
long evening in the character of an
old “Dead” concert. At their
return, the music took on a reggae
beat but kept some Garcia style in
“The Harder They Come, The
Harder They Fall.”

The old songs of the “Dead”
were not in abundance that night
but “Mission in The Rain” was the
best offered. Guitar work was
ﬂawless. Garcia was in ﬁne form,
but with the vocals available from
Muldaur and the wizardry of the
masculine Godchaux on keyboard,
the band could have and should
have shown more versatility.

The Jerry Garcia Band wound up
its four-hour extravaganza with
McCartney’s “Roll It Over,” the
Band’s “The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down” and a host of gospel
tunes, the last being “It Looks Like
Palm Sunday” but it was really
early Monday.

Dustin Hoffman and Theresa Russell don’t rise above the dialogue in “Straight
Time.”

I was gambling in Havana

I took a little risk.

Send lawyers, guns and money,
Dad, get me out of this.

Warren Zevon takes a lot of risks
on his album, “Excitable Boy,”
risks like songs about psychopathic
killers, werewolves, headless mer-
cenaries and the American invasion
of Mexico.

Known primarily as a writer for
Linda Ronstadt (see “Poor, Pitiful
Me”) Warren Zevon has come out
with one of the best albums of the

year. Featuring all-star backup
talent--Mick Fleetwood, John Mc-
Vie, Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar and
the fantastic Linda Ronstadt on
backup vocals--Zevon and producer
Jackson Browne have blended a

stores and banks, action takes
center stage. The robberies are the
best part of the movie, and as
Hoffman scurries from one heist to
another, the audience is captivated.

But the action is mindless,

‘though interesting——it is action

purely for action’s sake, to keep the
audience watching. The ending of
the movie proves this: mug shots of
Dembo degressing in time from the
most recent shot to one of him as a
child. Sargent’s and Bunker’s
theme seems to be “once a thief,
always a thief.”

Director Ulu Grasbard tries to
create confusion and uneasiness
with long, wondering looks and
thought-gathering pauses from his
main characters——but he fails. His
action shots are ﬁne, but conversa-
tion is poorly done——at times, one
character speaks to another from
outside the frame, creating delivery
that echoes or sounds distant.
Thank goodness he had Hoffman in
the starring role, or else “Straight
Time” would be as pointless to
watch as its script is to read.

Dustin Hoffman is good in “Straight Time” but the picture isn’t.

from Denmark to the Congo and
eventually winds up in Berkeley.
All the while, he makes it sound
like an old Irish love ballad.

Zevon uses his flare with the
unusual to come up with the two
classic pieces of the album.

The title track‘ is a ﬁrst-rate piece
of pop melody and harmony on just
the ﬁrst listen, but get closer. Is
this a pop tune?

“Excitable Boy” is not your

average boy meets girl love
song-try your average psychopath
meets victim love song instead.

And the piece works, perhaps
because of the irony of melody and

lyrics, or perhaps just on Zevon’s
straight-faced singing.

Zevon uses the same formula on
what is undoubtedly the album’s
centerpiece, “Werewolves of Lon-
don.” Again Zevon uses a catchy
pop beat to sing about werewolves
let loose in the foggy streets of
London. Zevon even goes so far as
to give us a werewolf who was.

The sheer animalness of Zevon
howling like a drunken werewolf
throughout the song, the driving
rhythm and the tongue-in-cheek
humor all make “Werewolves of
London” easily the most sellable
(it’s already an FM hit) and the
most enjoyable song on the album.

With the release of “Excitable
Boy,” Warren Zevon has arrived as
one of the decade’s best singer-
songwriters, in the same vein as

Frank Zappa and Randy Newman.

Pitt News Staff Writer
The combination of Pitt’s
men’s and women’s tennis teams
served the first ace of the season
last weekend by capturing the ﬁrst
Pittsburgh Invitational Challenge
Cup at the Greentree Racquet Club.

The Panther-Pantherette merger
lost only two matches (mixed
doubles and men’s singles)
throughout the tournament, which
was a spinoff of last year's Saranac
Cup and followed a World Team
Tennis format.

The tournament provided a
warmup for the Panthers, who
began a ﬁve-match road trip
yesterday, while the Pantherettes
must wait until April 7 to open their
spring schedule, when they will face
Duquesne on the Bluff.

It _;was those same Duchesses,
paired with the Dukes, that Pitt
lobbed, 31-15, in Sunday’s ﬁnals.
Pitt gained entrance to the
championship round by acing
Robert Morris, 31-15, Friday, and
smashing both West Liberty, 30-7,

and Carnegie-Mellon, 28-10, .Sat-

urday.

“The tournament offered some
good competition,” said the
Panthers’ George Dieffenbach,
who, along with his Pantherette
counterpart, Nancy Gordon,

coached the squad. “It wasn't real

strong competition, but the other'

teams pressured us.”

Pantherettes Maria Paris and
Janet DeCostro began each match
as Pitt’s women’s doubles contin-
gent, and didn’t lose a single set;
Paris followed by doing likewise in
women’s singles action.

“It was very important that the
women started each match and
padded the score for us,”
Dieffenbach said. “I’m very
impressed with Maria and Janet.”

The men’s pairings included “a
Tom Liebenguth-Bill Pilardy part-
nership, which went undefeated in
the ﬁrst (Robert Morris) and ﬁnal
(Duquesne) matches, while Lieben-
guth and Kevin Quay continued the
trend in the middle two against
West Liberty and C-MU. Lieben-
guth relieved Pilardy in men’s
singles play after Pilardy lost to his
Robert Morris foe in the opener;
Liebenguth was undefeated in his
singles matches.

The mixed doubles chores were
handled by Quay and Pam
Bachman, who accounted for Pitt’s
only other lost match in the
tournament.

Meanwhile, after the Panthers
complete their ﬁrst ﬁve road
matches, they will return to Trees

Stetler’s Lucky Seven Leaves Tankers |4th

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Seven-time all-American
Kathy Stetl?r became Pitt’s ﬁrst
women’s national swimming cham-
pion, while four other Pantherettes
earned all-American distinction in
leading Pitt to a strong 14th-place
finish at the Association of
Interscholastic Athletics for Women
National Championships at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., last
weekend.

“We had an outstanding meet,”
Pantherette swim coach Kate
Matheson said. “All the girls had
their best times of the year.”

Besides winning the 50-yard
butterfly, Stetler earned all
American recognition in four other
individual events—the 50-, 100-,
and 200-yard freestyles and the
100-yard butterﬂy. The junior also
anchored both the 200- and
400-yard freestyle relay teams,
comprised of freshmen Patty Davis,
Suzanne Pulley and junior Christy

as Jackie Sherrill needs a big-time quarterback...

Elston, as both teams swam to
all-American status.

Team records were set in all ﬁve
of Stetler’s individual events and
both relays. Stetler’s time in the
50-yard butterﬂy (25.57) was
one-tenth of a second shy of a
national record. Pulley, a freshman
from Richmond, Va., missed
all-American honors by six one-
hundredths of a second in the
100-yard individual medley. The top
16 ﬁnishers in each event were
named all-American.

“We were expecting to ﬁnish in
the top 20 as a team this weekend, ”
said Matheson, noting that 80
teams competed in the three-day
competition. “We were very
pleased with our showing.”

Pitt ﬁnished with 96 points.
Favorite Arizona State won the
team championship, while Florida
ﬁnished second. Rutgers, Princeton
and Penn State—the teams that
ﬁnished ahead of Pitt in the recent
Eastern Regional Championships-

all placed behind the Pantherettes.

Eastern champion Rutgers man-
aged a disappointing six points.
Penn State, which edged Pitt for
third-place honors in the Eastern
Regionals, didn’t score any points.

“We ﬁnished ahead of _every
team we met during the dual-meet
season and Easterns,” Matheson
said. “We were ready for this meet.
Unlike Rutgers, we shaved and
tapered (practiced speed while
cutting down distance in practice)

  Edelman Named lion Assistant is

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP)-
Ray Edelman, head basketball‘
coach at the Haverford School for
the last ﬁve years, yesterday was
named an assistant to new Penn
State basketball coach Dick Harter.

Edelman compiled a 95-15 record
at Haverford, a private school in
Philadelphia’s Main Line district.

Before that, he was an assistant to
Harter at the University of
Pennsylvania and Oregon. He will
begin his new duties immediately, a
Penn State spokesman said.

“I’m delighted to be working
with Ray again,” Harter said in
announcing the appointment. “He
is an outstanding student of the

Walker’s name that it has been misspelled by the
Press, Post-Gazette, Pitt News and each television
station so often that “Eliot” may be his legal name
by this time...

game and an excellent teacher.”
Edelman graduated from West
Chester State College in 1950,
began coaching at the high school
level in New Jersey, and spent 12
years in the Haverford public school

system. He also holds a masters

degree in physical education from
Temple.

just right. Rutgers had to shave and
taper twice—ﬁrst, for the Easterns,
and then, for this meet.

“We did, too, but we had enough
background that it didn’t bother
us,” Matheson continued. “By
background, I mean we had enough
distance work at the beginning of
the season that it didn’t bother us to
shave and taper so much now.”

With the season over, Matheson
is already thinking about next
season.

“At this point, we have to ﬁnish
up on our recruiting,” the
Pantherette coach said. “Although
a lot of high school swimmers won’t
make their college choices until
after the AAU Nationals in early
April, we still think we’ll get our
share of good swimmers, especially
after the super meet we had
Saturday.”

The Pantherettes will lose only
one senior (Mary Waldy) through
graduation.

terback able to master a throw longer than the pitch,
he might be wise to consider moving Jones to
wingback, the position occupied by Bruce Murphy
under John Majors several seasons ago...

1’ Gordon Jones needs a quarterback almost as
much as does Sherrill, but there’s nothing Pitt’s all-
time best receiver can do about it other than perhaps
hope pro scouts will remember what Jones was like
with Matt Cavanaugh over center. ..

1’ Jackie Sherrill’s football team is one decent
quarterback removed from a nine-win season. If no
able arms are around by September, the Pitt team
could lose as many as four games...

it Sherrill was taking about moving JoJo Heath
again, even before spring practice started, which was
a mistake. With Elliott Walker gone (more on Walker
in a moment), no Pitt runner is markedly better than
Heath and several are demonstrably worse. If Sherrill

doesn’t give Heath a decent shot at running back,»
‘ he’lI only be hurting himself—and his team...

.1 No matter what anyone does or says, Heath
will start at flanker, defensive back, or not at all...

5/ One would believe that almost everyone in
Pittsburgh would be able to spell the name of Pitt’s
second-leading career rusher, especially since he’s
still in school. But Pittsburgh’s television stations
and newspapers have so much trouble with Elliott

1/ One person who had no trouble with Walker’s
name was the California agent who recently flew
Walker and J.C. Wilson to the coast, and, after

 

signing each to an agency contract worth two or three
percent of an expected pro contract, gave each Pan-
ther transportation to Pittsburgh. They didn’t fly
first class, though—-instead, each was given enough
cash to purchase a luxury car (Lincolns) as an advan-
ce...

I’ After the Panthers’ big four are drafted,
LeRoy Felder, Wilson and Walker figure to be
chosen, also...

I’ At least that's what the agent hopes...

./ Speaking of hopes, If Sherrill can’t find a quar-

  

./ Sherrill’s new offices at Pitt Stadium—donated
by a local contractor insane with Pitt Panther
pride—are so nice everyone should see them. And
they’re so nice, everyone will complain about them
when—and it will happen someday—Pitt football
returns to t-he pits...

5’ Grgurich will be able to withstand a poor
recruiting season—and it appears Guy is the only
man whose signature can prevent this year from
being one-—mainly because he has transfer Carlton
Neverson, a smooth 6-4 guard who will play and
could start next season. Sam Clancy, Ed Scheuer-
mann and Wayne Williams are Pitt’s only sure
returning starters. Terry Knight is a step behind, with
Neverson, Pete Strickland, Dave Olinger and,
perhaps, Guy also holding some hope...” ' i  ‘ P

I’ It is to be hoped, for Mickey’s Crowley’s sake,
that when final judgment is at hand, and his call in
the Pitt-Villanova game is questioned, referee
Crowley will have the presence of mind to use an in-
sanity plea as his defense...

reason...

Analysis: Baseball Magazines Contain Predictable Features

With the season opener less than a month away,
the so-called experts are busy making their predic-
tions for the coming major league baseball season.

Will the Pirates or Phillies win in the National
League East? The Yankees or Red Sox in the
American League East? Kansas City or Texas in the
AL West? The Dodgers or Reds in the NL West?

These are some of the questions the experts will try
to answer. How well the experts answer these
questions depends on how lucky they are and how
much they know.

The experts fall into two categories. Some are
amateurs. This group makes its predictions for the
fun of it. Others are more fortunate and get paid for
their expertise. This latter group includes those who
contribute their predictions for the baseball
magazines that dominate newsstands this time of
year.

Publications like Baseball Quarterly, Baseball
Illustrated, Baseball Today, Dell’s Baseball/1978,
Popular Sports Baseball, and Baseball Forecast, the
first six baseball magazines released this winter, are
expected to provide the do-it—for—fun expert with
“secretive” information he isn’t supposed to know.

Unfortunately for the amateur expert who expects
such information, these magazines don’t always
provide it. Magazines of this type have a way of
looking and sounding alike without saying too much.
Predictions, team previews and feature stories are all
mysteriously similar. Read one and you have read
them all.

You’ll see the same holds true this baseball
season, too. Of the six magazines mentioned, four
have New York Yankees star and World Series most
valuable player Reggie Jackson pictured on their

while all ofthem, except Baseball Quarterly, have
“expert” predictions and team previews.

To save you the time and expense of reading all
these magazines, here is a quick rundown of all six:

Baseball Quarterly: If you’re planning on doing
some serious reading about the 1978 season, this
would be one of your better investments. For $1.25
about the standard rate for the other magazines, you
will find interesting features about major league bat-
ting champ Rod Carew, Pirate slugger Dave Parker

 

and an informative interview with Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner.

No predictions or individual team previews are in-
cluded. You experts are expected to make your own.

Baseball Illustrated: This magazine includes com-
plete team rosters. But that is the only different and
informative thing it contains. It provides in—depth
analysis of every major league club, if you call two or
three paragraphs (four at most) in-depth analysis.
Baseball Illustrated does; few others will.

Baseball Today: It’s the undisputed flop of the
bunch. Save your money, and don’t buy it. The
baseball version of the National Enquirer, it’s written
along the lines of a gossip sheet you find in the

BaseballToday reeks of sensationalism, as one of
its articles, “Death Stalks Three Big League Teams,”
attests. In this all-too-typical article, three big league
teams, including the Pirates, are reported to have “a
jinx clouding their climates year after year” because
of the rash of deaths each has had in the past few
years.

Baseball/1978: One of the more conservative
periodicals, this magazine contains full-page, team-
by-team previews, predictions and, of course, a
single feature about Jackson.

Popular Sports Baseball: This one includes your
standard predictions and feature about Reggie
Jackson and Yankee manager Billy Martin. First
part of magazine is good and informative. Several
interesting columns are found here, including one
about baseball wives. After that, the magazine gets
progressively worse. The lead feature about Jackson
is disappointing. Also included is a feature about a
West Coast witch and the way she enabled Dodger
Ron Cey to hit a grand slam home run to win a game
for the Dodgers last year.

Baseball Forecast: While containing “exclusive
playoff predictions” just like the rest of the
magazines and a feature about Jackson, this is one of
the magazines (along with Baseball Quarterly) that
doesn’t feature him on the cover. For those of you
who get into hanging Rod Carew, Dodger star Steve
Garvey, and Reggie Jackson on your walls, this
magazine includes color pinups of each.

Yet to be released are the special pre—season_
editions published by The Sporting News, Sports
Illustrated and Baseball Digest. These issues are
traditionally the most up—to—date, informative and
factual publications released about the sport. They

Pantherette Gymnastic Pair Headed for National Meet

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Two members of Pitt's
women’s gymnastics team will be
traveling to the University of
Washington to compete in the
Association of Interscholastic Ath-
letics for .Women National Cham-
pionships beginning March 29.

Freshmen Myra Bachuchin and
Bonnie Tressler were notiﬁed of
their qualiﬁcation for the all-around
competition late last week, based on
their scores at the Eastern
Regionals.

The two Pantherettes were
chosen from a field of top
competitors, who performed in any
of the nine regional competitions

held at various locations across the
nation. Competitors for the all-
around competition include mem-
bers of the top-scoring teams
nationally and the next 14 highest
individual scores.

“I was very conﬁdent that both
Myra and Bonnie would make it to
Nationals,” said coach Donna
DeMarino. “It’s just unfortunate
the whole team couldn't go.” '

The Pantherette team narrowly
missed (by .95 points) gaining a
berth to the national team
competition.

“We didn’t think we would bv
that close to qualifying,” DeMarino
said. “In a way, it is more
disappointing to know that you

College in their ﬁrst home match
March 31. Pitt’s 1978 schedule is
nearly identical to the one that
produced a mediocre 8-12 record
last year; the Panthers will face
many area schools in addition to
powerhouses Penn State and
Bucknell. ,

Depth seems to be the biggest
question mark for the Panthers,
who will return with only four
letterwinners—Chuck Brand, Tom
Gault, Liebenguth and Quay.
George Hoffman, Joe Mayers and
Pilardy round out the Panthers’
starting seven.

The Pantherettes, on the other
hand, are in better shape with seven
experienced players back for spring
action. Janice Irwin, Nancy
Ballistreri, Jan Brownstein, Jen-
nifer Mullen and Lois Moses should
provide sufﬁcient complement to
the Paris-DeCostro-Bauchman
threesome.

Although the Pantherettes’
schedule is still unfinalized,
tentative plans have them traveling
to Princeton April 21 for the Middle
States tournament, to Virginia for
the Middle Atlantictournament and
to Ohio for a tri-match against
Miami of Ohio and Marshall.
