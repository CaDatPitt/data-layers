against Dartmouth ‘was enough

warning to respect the West Point soldiers.”

His selection as Coach of the

Week actually was postponed for

a week. Only Pennsylvania’s 13-7 victory over previously unbeaten
Princeton‘ deprived the former Michigan State backfield coach of
top honors last week. Instead Penn’s George Munger received the

shingle.

Fortunately Dawson had the services of most of his top stars

against Notre Dame but in the Army battle ,as many as four key,
players were out of the lineup. This, coupled with a zany offense,
drew an abundance of praise from New York critics.

What the critics don’t know,

however, is that Dawson, here-

tofore a well—traveled man, expects to be around a long time.
“Around,” he laughs, “until they throw me out.”

Desp"ite'his youth, Steve is. a
natural for the job. Born in Ber-

as well as in Munich and Ham-
burg until the long arm of war
interrupted his education and put
him into a forced labor camp in
1943 for two years. '

from the ruins of Hamburg after
a 100-hour air raid, the Nazis
drove about the streets in trucks
picking up all the men, women
and children in sight. Steve was
caught up in the net. Separated
from his family,-. Steve was sent
as a slave laborer to a farming
village in the Bavarian Moun-

ploughed ﬁelds, and fed animals
every day from sun—up until sun-

“The treatment was, let us say,

as you did your work, no one
would bother you.”

‘With the end of the war in
1945, came Steve’s liberation and
eventual journey to the U. S.
with his parents and sister. In the
fall of 1948," after a six-months
stay in England, he arrived’ here
and entered Taylor Alderdice

C  .Mstter of Principle

This is United Nations Week. To we who -live in a
-democracy, the date has as ’much political importance as
g the Fourth of July, for it commemoratesa day when 49

V nations agreed to band together, as thirteen" colonies once‘
" did, under a charter guaranteeing the individual integrity
of all men. The charter sets forth the principle-that each
‘_‘man has a right to work out ‘his life as .he'see ﬁt, and
. that the only morally justiﬁable government exercises its
power throuhgpersuasion, compromise and consent, not.
orce. . ‘
The UN ‘has grown, as the thirteen States did, from
49' nations to 60. No one can yet ,say whether it will ever
achieve apolitical integration ‘comparable with that of
thepresent United States, or whether it will even sur-
vive the generation which founded it, but to those who
adhere to the democratic faith, it is -a nobleand necessary
step. _ .
- iUN Week is being observed here, as it was last year,
by a three—day program of events, the highlight of which
. is a model session of a branch of the UN.organization—this
* _ yefr the Trusteeship Council, in which ~stude_n'ts- from twelve
_.fo 'eign countries will discuss religious and racial problems
of British and French colonies in Africa. »

What better way can we observe UN Week than by
attending the model session and the other events planned
for the week? .- . .

In New York at the United
Nations Headquarters events are
taking place which may well be
more important than the presi-
dential election which is hogging
the news at the present time.
The session
of the UN
which has just
convened has
to f a c e the
tr 0 u blesome
p r oblems of
colonial rela-
t i o n ship in
North Africa,
and race rela- ‘
tions in South

 

’ ,

Africa. Even more iniportant the
United States has decided to
bring the problem of the Korean

‘W - . stalemate before the UN_ gen-

eral assembly.

Drumaﬁzed Events .
Pitt students have dramatized"
these events by‘ observing UN

‘week. Today the second annual

model session of the United Na-
tions Security Council is being
held at the Foster Memorial. An- .
other group of students, the Pitt

s+a|:ises+   Hope 

Federalists, are presenting a UN
ﬂag to the University at the
model session.

It is good to, see that some
people are still paying attention
to the UN’s activities. Most peo-
ple seem to have forgotten its

existence. In this campaign many
people have talked as if the Unit-
ed States and South Korea were
the only countries concerned
with the Korean war.

Best Hope
Actually the UN is still the

. best hope of the world. No na-

tion, not even the Soviet Union,
wants to ﬁght the whole world. \
Stalin’s latest statements have
shown that he is banking on dis-
sention among _the non—com—
munist nations to bring him vic-
tory. This can happen unless the
United. States can keep the free
nations of the world together
through the UN. The moral pow-
er of the United ‘Nations can do
as much as all the guns or the
money we have. Fortunately
Secretary Acheson seems to real-
ize this. , i
We should not only continue
to work through the UN but

“Brotherhood: Dream or Reality?” will be the theme of

scheduled for February 22 ‘to 25,

The announcement was made by A. C. Payne, director‘

‘of the Pitt YMCA, at an opene ‘

student meeting last week. Mr.
Payne, also gave a brief back-

ground of Re1igion—in-Life week "

and the spirit in which it will be
conducted this year.

Student Congress President Jack
Burwinkle conducted the business
portion of the meeting, at which
time the following executives
were elected to serve on the Re-
ligion—in—Life steering committee:
Joseph Marasco, student chairman;
Allan Reuben, Jewish faith chair-
man; Carol Consavage, Catholic
faith chairman; _ Mary Fuget,
Protestant faith chairman; Helen
More, secretary; Joe Schuler, ﬁ-
nance chairman; Chancellor R. H.
Fitzgerald, honorary "chairman;
Dr. Demus Barnes, faculty chair-
man; Dr. Raymond Brittain, fac-
ulty advisor; and Dean T. W. Bid-
dle, treasurer. ‘ x

A motion to have a separate
faith chairman for each Protestant
denomination was overwhelming-_
ly defeated by the students pres-

the steering committee one rep-
res_entative from each of the three
major groups was sufficient. Every
student istwelcome at religion-in-
life activities Whether his faith is
represented directly or indirectly,
or if he has no religious aﬂiliation.

This year the Religi0n—in—Life
committee is planning to make
the annual conference more con-
ducive to student participation.
The use of ﬁlms, folk singing and
square dancing is being consid
ered, as is the possibility of‘hold—
ing the main assembly in the

$100,000 Donated
Mr. Adams and Mr. Whitehill,
both members of the committee,
said -that the committee is optim-
istic about the project,

David Lawrence, is working on
the project.

The first move of the commit-
tee will be to form a non-proﬁt

problem at present, a step for-
ward in that direction has already
been made. A foundation has of-
fered anonymously about $100,000
to help ﬁnance the construction.
$200,000 Needed

The committee expects the rest
of «the money, about $200,000 for
construction, to come in the form
of donations from clubs, PTA
groups, and similar organizations.

There is a possibility that the
station may be included in a net-
work formed by other educational
institutions in the state.

Mr. Whitehill pointed out that
the word “educational” in this
case, could apply to programs sim-
ilar to the Town Meeting of the
Air, or the Theater Guild.

“This will not necessarily be a
station to give courses" over the
air,” he added.

The Law School Admission
Test required of applicants for ad'-
mission to a number of leading
American law schools will be giv-
en at more than 100 centers
throughout the United States on
the morning of November :15."

Pitt is one of these centers. The
test will be administered by the
University Testing Service "in
139 C1. . '

A candidate should make sep-
arate application for admission to
each law school of his choice and‘
should inquire of each whether
they require the results of the test
for admission. Since many law
schools select their freshman
classes in the spring preceding
their entrance, candidates for ad-
mission to next year’-s classes are
advised ordinarily to take either
the November or February test, if
possible. 2

Bulletins and applications for
the test should be obtained four to
six weeks in advance of the test-‘
ing date from Law School Ad-
mission Test, Educational Test-
ing Service, P.O. Box 592, Prince-.

must be received at least ten ‘days - _

soil after three road games.

The cagey sophomore quar-
terback, used almost exclusively
as the defensive safety in the past
two years played a full quarter
at left halfback against Army and
is working out at that spot in the
absence of Johnny Jacobs as the
Blue-and—Gold get set to meetthe
invaders from West Virginia.

The status of Jacobs, latest cas-
ualty on Coach Red Dawson’s
crippled squad, will not be de-.
termined until the cast is removed
from his injured leg today or to-
morrow.

Injuries Bring Switch

Ford was a candidate for the
T-quarterback job early in the
season, but his services were re-
quired on defense, where he was
a standout last season. “

The switch was the latest move
forced ‘V upon Dawson, who has
been hard-pressed to ﬁll gaps in
key positions from a limited re-
serve—-—gaps caused by injuries at-

Besides Jacobs, four other regu-
lars will be out .-of the ‘lineup in-

in gaining their third win of the_
season, and keeping intact their
record of scoring at least three
touchdowns against all oppon_ents.

Divers’ Rally Dumps Wonders

The Dorimont Divers came from behind with two touchdowns:
in the last four minutes of play to down the Seoreless Wonders,
24-18, in a_ thriller_ at Schenley Oval Friday afternoon.

The win gave the Divers undisputed possession of, ﬁrst place
in the American League with a perfect record of three wins in _as
many games. For’ the Wonders it marked their first defeat of the

year against one win.

passing ace, ﬁgured in every Dor-

racked up their ﬁrst two touch-

spectively. - '
Then trailing 18-12 with‘ but
four minutes left in’-’ the contest
Parker again connected with a
40-yard pass to the fast-moving,
elusive Magnani which sent_ the

‘You would expect to ﬁnd a betting man in ‘a Green-_

wich_Village hideaway the night before a major New York .

football game, ‘but the guy that cornered me in Asti’s Res-
taurant on West 13th‘ St. just didn’t seem the type.

His procedure in trying to attach more dough to his
income convinced me of that. -

At his trade. Pincus, the . -
waiter, was as proﬁcient with a

had been when he directed Pan-
ther trafﬁc through those big holes

busiest 30 minutes of football.
Pincus’ faith in accepting the
opinion of ' a, stranger—worse than

 

been above the sub-basement in

«two years of picking football winners-—was the downfall of this

after-dark employee to the tune of '50 bucks.

Pinky. on Short 

If he ‘would have listened to the guys in the know, Pinky

‘probably would have been doing the Village like me and several-

hundred Pitt rooters Saturday .night. But he_ ignored what fellow

"A New Yorkers had torsay. '

They scribbled the Pitt—Army rendezvous as at Panther honey-

‘moon, in their effort to win another game. All Pincus had to do,

then, was read the sporties, drop_60 dollars in a bookie’s hand and

drop "back 24 lrlours later for a 50 buck investment return, provid-

ing, of course, that the book was still in business. ,

_ Instead, Pincus met me; “convorsed” about short-ends and short
ibeers, and walked away convinced that Pitt couldn’t”possibly win

with four of its stars out of the lineup.

My advice to the whiskey pusher was lay oif Pitt and save
a ‘few; bucks. After all, I had my information from several not-so-

conﬁdent gridders but failed to read the scribes, just like Pincus.

Real ‘Army Hospitality

Everything went swell for Pitt ‘at the Point over the weekend.

The freshman gridders won their game as did the varsity, who re-

turned to this burg with nothing but nicetiesfrom “little ole New

_Yor ”, sports writers.

But how the Generals can have the" nerve to supply visiting
teams with dressing rooms and no hot or cold showers is the puzzler.
After the ﬁnal play, the Panthers rushed off the ﬁeld and paraded
into ‘buses for a: ﬁve—mi1e trip back to their headquarters at Bear

Mountain Inn.

That’s not as bad, ﬁthough, as what Army officials pulled in 1950
when the Frosh, scheduled to play an afternoon game, were ushered
out of bed at 9:30 a.m. and informed that game time had» been

changed to 11:30 a.m.

-

Although the Pitt frosh beat the Army plebes by only
ﬁve points, the grid Cubs distinguished themselves at West
Point as a youthful power with class.

For the ﬁrst eight minutes last Friday afternoon, the
plebes strongly indicated that they would revenge the 1950
defeat that the Panthers handed them, 16-13. But after Army
scored two fashtouchdowns it was Pitt the rest ofthe wa
