Kat Belendiuk was going to run
a marathon.

Two years, two Marine Core

Marathons and countless miles of
training later, she’s preparing for a

_ 26.2-mile trek across the snow and

ice covering, of all places, Antarc-

“I think it’s so cool that I’ll get to

a 25-year-old Pitt graduate student. '

a good job you have to take a bet-
ter job, and there’s no doubt in my
mind that there’s a great future
here, there’s agreat tradition here,
and coach Wannstedt was the right
man to work for and get this job
done.”

Cignetti got his first coaching
job at Pitt as a graduate assistant in
1989 under Mike Gottfried, and his

‘father, Frank Cignetti Sr., was head

coach at Indiana, Pa., from 1986-
2005 and coached West Virginia
from 1976-79.

Cignetti Jr. spent 2007 as quar-
terbacks coach of the San Fran-
cisco 49ers, was North Carolina’s
offensive coordinator in 2006 and
was offensive coordinator at Fres-
no State from 2002-05.

Runners stock up on supplies, seek magic potion

Belendiuk, page 4

said, is choosing which organiza-
tion to beneﬁt.
“There are many great organi-

zations, deserving organizations,

so it’s tough to pick one,” said

Belendiuk. “I thought Antarctica

would be a good speaking point.”
So did many others.

. Demand for spots on the Ant-
arctica Marathon is greater than
for any other race coordinated by
Marathon Tours and Travel, said
Gilligan. Participants must  up
two years in advance to guarantee
a position on the Antarctica Mara-
thon. There are only a few hundred
spots and they ﬁll up quickly.

Preparing for the physical battle

At ﬁrst glance, running in Ant-
arctica will be oddly similar to run-
ning in Pittsburgh. The tempera-
tures on  George Island, where
the six—and-a—half-hour marathon
will be held, are expected to range
between 15 and 30 degrees, about
the same as Pittsburgh’s projected
temperatures. The marathon track

leads runners to ascend Collins
Glacier, which is similar in height
to Negley Hill in Squirrel Hill.

“Antarctica might actually be
nicer than Pittsburgh at the time
of the race,” said Belendiuk.

said, but she does take salt tablets
to help keep her electrolyte count
up. .
Every 15 minutes during the
race she will take Gu, a carbohy-
drate, potassium and sodium sup-

that’s what Gu does.” '

The racers use Bellingshausen,

and ﬁnish line. The ﬁgure-eight

“The researchers are usually
excited about the marathons,” said
 “They live a pretty mun-
dane existence out there, counting
the raindrops.”

Since the race began in 1995,
the Russian scientists have devel-
oped a reputation for enjoying" the
craziness of hosting the runners.
Bringing the Russians gifts has be-
come a custom.

The suggested gift is liquor of
any kind. This year Oleg, the base
commander, has requested a ski-
mobile.

. “I hear they want vodka,” said
Belendiuk. “As a scientist I could
sympathize with the importance of
having scientists down there, so I’m
in support of their endeavors.”

As part of the tours there will
be educational ‘seminars on envi-
ronmental protection and preser-
vation. ‘

ly. “The racers come back as better
educated custodians.”

Gilligan said that the actual run-
ning in Antarctica becomes sec-
ondary to the experience of being
there.

“It’s such a pristine landscape,”
he said. “It is such a profound and
stilling atmosphere.”

Belendiuk added, “This is not
going to be a race—to-the-ﬁnish
race, this is going to be something
to really enjoy.”

She said she’s looking forward
to working with adolescents after
she earns her degree. She hopes to
have her own lab some day and to
do her own research.

But Belendiuk wouldn’t mind
racing more either.

“Pittsburgh is a great place to
do research, so if I was able to
do something here that would be
fabulous,” shesaid. “But if I could
have a magic potion and get my-
self a perfect career, it would be
doing what I do now, justa little bit
warmer.”

This isn’t to say that police

that a single two-hour spree of cita-

laws in a place like Oakland.

Campaigns like that might work
in areas with a lower incidence of
citation-worthy activity, but the sheer
prevalence of it in Oakland as-
sures that no two hours will ever be
enough.

Instead of sudden, unannounced
crackdowns, the police and the Uni-

Pepsi 'eathless' over new logo

by Erik I‘Iinton
Columniat

It is likely that PepsiCo has
gone crazy. Last week, Gawker.
corn led a massive Internet leak
of the purported strategy behind
Pepsi’s October logo redesign.
The document is alleged to have
come from Arnell Group, the
company that PepsiCo paid a ru-
mored million—dollar-plus fee for
its new look.

\While you might scoff at the
maddeningly high ﬁgure for what
is, essentially, a smudging of red
and blue, just wait until you read
the marketing strategy behind the
logo, titled “Breathtaking.”

In the course of the 27—page
treatise, the new Pepsi logo is
linked to the Mona Lisa, the
golden ratio, magnetic fields of
Mother Earth, the entire cosmos
and the range of human emotion.
Section titles include “A Multi-
Dimensionalized Brand,” “The
Pepsi Universe” and “Dynamic
Forces.” At one point the gravi-
tational effect of the sun on light
from stars is compared to the
gravitational effects of the new
Pepsi logo on consumers in the
typical shopping aisle. Yes, it’s re-
ally that batty.

In the time between the leak
of "Breathtaking” and now, nu-
merous theories have popped
up as to what exactly the Pepsi-
Arnell lunacy actually is. The con-
sensus is either that it is a hoax or
that PepsiCo was ripped off by a
design firm that works under the
constant inﬂuence of Dark Side
of t/ye Moon. Is this some viral ad
campaign? Is this real? The blo-
gosphere is hung.

Meanwhile, the affair has
caused me to think about the
Sokal Hoax. In 1996, Allan Sokal,
professor of physics at New York
University, published “Trans-
gressing the Boundaries: Towards
a Transformative Hermeneutics
of Quantum Gravity” in the jour-
nal Social Text. A feverish hodge-
podge of jargon, pseudo-philos-
ophy and mathematics, the article

 

was written to be nonsensical and
misleading.

However, it used popular
buzzwords, came from a re-
spected source and, in general,
had the right appearance. It made
it past the editors, and what was
published became a beating stick
for academia for the next decade.
The hoax nearly detailed the
scholastic pursuit of modern phi-
losophy, decrying the discipline as
indiscernible from nonsense.

Fake or not, “Breathtaking” is
the Sokal Hoax of our times. If
the document is vetted as legiti-
mate, a punishing blow is struck
to advertising and aesthetics as
a rampant waste of money on
puffed—up nonsense. \

If this turns out to be another

46

At one point the gravita-
tional effect of the sun on
light from stars is com»
pared to the gravitational
effects of the new Pepsi
logo on consumers in the
typical shopping aisle.
Yes, it's really that batty.

S?

in the long line of sneaky viral
marketing or just an outright forg-
ery, the damage is still done. The
mere fact that few would be ter-
ribly surprised either way stands
as a testament to the hollowness
of the rhetoric of marketing and
cultural studies.

However, I have never been
satisﬁed with the response to the
Sokal Hoax, and I, undoubtedly,
will be displeased by the effect of
“Breathtaking” as well.

The arguments by which Sokal
and Pepsi-Arnell do damage to
the. fields that they represent go
as follows: The authors of these
documents composed them
somewhat randomly and intend-
ed them to say nothing. These
pieces are almost impossible "to

discern from similar pieces that:

were intended to be meaningful
in their respective arenas. ‘
Therefore, all, or at least most,
of the current work in the given
arena is tantamount to nonsense.
At least that was Sokal’s intent in

publishing his piece. Sokal wrote _

in a response to the debacle that
he did it “to combat a currently
fashionable postrnodernist/ post-
structuralist/ social-constructivist
discourse.”

However, what Sokal over-
looks and what future critics of
“Breathtaking” will fail to realize
is that the very nonsense they see
as an outing of modern thought’s
sham is something that this phi-
losophy would embrace. Moder-
nity has not lapsed into nonsense,
it has intentionally gone there to
bring out the equal nonsensical-
ity of more traditional thought.
All thought is on equally shaky
ground. History has just rein-
forced the appearance of its clas-
sics. I
The details of this argument
are too numerous to go into here,
but it suffices to ask the question,
“Why do we assume that some-
thing written with every intent
to make sense has more value or
meaning than something written
with the opposite intent?” In the
end, either way all we have are
nice orders of characters. Who is
to say which will be more enlight-
ening?

By the date of this column’s
writing, I have examined “Breath-
taking” in excess of 20 times.
Much like those who see con-
stellations if ' they stare at the sky
long enough, I have begun to see
something of value in the work.

Perhaps all the circles show
how Pepsi’s logo is breaking away
from the formal constraints of an
icon. .

Perhaps the mood of the logo
really does change at different
angles. In the end, I’m just draw-
ing bears and archers out of stars.
However, dots of light or dots of
ink, isn’t all reading just drawing
constellations?

Piracy isn't going away

by Richard Brown
Opinio/2.1 Editor

Internet piracy has been around
for a while now; Napster, the original
peer-to-peer ﬁle transfer network that

popularized ﬁle sharing, started up in '

June of 1999. Since then, a plethora of

different services have sprung up to of-

fer ﬂee transfers of music, movies and
software to anyone, anywhere. And just
as often these services have been shut
down by the entertainment industry
and its coterie of rabid copyright law-
yers. -

The latest big name to fall under the
jackboot of copyright law is The Pirate
Bay, a Web site that offers users links
to BitTorrent tracker ﬁles. BitTorrent
is a type of p2p ﬁle transfer protocol

‘that allows users to download and up-

load massive amounts of data" across a
distnbutediWeb, avoiding the need for
central servers owned by one group.
But The Pirate Bay ‘is still on trial for
“assisting in making available” copy-
righted works in Sweden, and if the
creators, of the site lose, its likely that
it’ll be shut down.

For its own part, The Pirate Bay has
mounted a creative defense under a few
provisions of EU law and has managed

to get about half the charges against it _

dropped by the court. But in the end,
this trial is tantamount to attacking a
hornet nest with nothing but a ﬂyswat-
ter. Sure, you might take out a couple,
but at the end-of the day, there’s still
going to be a lot more hornets, andall

‘ you’re going to be is stung.
"Piracy, like it or not, has become an.

ingrained part of the Intemet, and it’s
all because of the way the Internet has

I that number could be now.

ﬂee has led us to believe that everything
on the Internet is ﬂee, like it oi‘ not.
This probably isn’t the most produc-
tive way for people to View the world,
but I believe that it’s the truth. The In-
ternet is a giant, seething mass of in-
formation, but even more than that, it’s

' an anonymous source. That anonymity

leads people to believe that  don’t
really count on computers —- that ‘if
you’re committing a crime online, it’s
not really a crime.

i In a way, it’s like the riots that hap-

' pened after the Super Bowl. The crowd

   ?

an anonymity in the streets that allowed
some people to drastically misbehave.
Nobody would ever set a car on ﬁre in
the middle of the street or break shop
windows under normal circumstances,
but the ‘crowd made law enforcement
more or less impossible, so people took
advantage of that to break the law.
That’s exactly what happens with
ﬁle sharing and piracy. The number of
people who engage in these activities
is staggering — a review of .Record-
ing Industry Association. of America
‘data estimated a 20—percent reduction

. in global music sales, because of piracy

back in 2002. God only knows wha

But that huge) number of people

involved also offers security _— there’s ,

, people are going to try to share it. The .

only one rock -— new networks will just
spring up offering the same services as
soon as an old one is shut down.

The fact of the matter is that, as
long as entertainment industries are
producing content meant for the public,

same  happened before the days
of the Internet — people would pass
around mix tapes, bootlegged mov-
ies or simply let their friends borrow
stuff. This is the same  that goes
on now, but on a colossal scale. We’re
sharing our music with our ﬁiends, but
it’s impossible to discriminate among
“friends” online. ' '

Pretty much every industry that
produces content is facing the same
problem right now. How can you make
people pay for something that they can
get for ﬂee elsewhere? '

The answer, of course, is pretty
much that you can’t. Some people will
always be  to buy content, but as
piracy becomes more and more wide-
spread, and as more artists, newspapers
and television networks advocate ﬂee
digital distribution of their content,
it’s only going to get worse. For every
person willing to pay for a product,
whether it’s $10 for an album on iTunes
or $300 for the new Photoshop, there’s
going to be someone else  to toe
the line of the law so they can get it_for
ﬂee.

So the copyright enforcers can go
ahead and shut down The Pirate Bay

if they want to. But they probably,
‘know already that, as soon as they do,

another site will take its place. As long
as the Internet remains an open and
anonymous worldwide network, there

_ will be people  to hoist their own

skulls-and-crossbones. People are con-
ditioned to ﬁnd safety in numbers, and

a few copyright lawsuits aren’t going to

The game of basketball is played
within the same parameters every time:
an 84—by—50—foot court and a rim raised
10 feet above the ﬂoor. The 3-point line
is a constant, as is the free throw line and
the rules on the court;

But at places like Pitt, there’s some—i

thing off the court — something that
can’t always be measured — that has a
profound impact on the outcome of the
game There’s something that stands out
to opponents and gives the home team
an advan

The Oakland Zoo, Pitt’s student sec-
tion, is one of those phenomenon.

“The Zoo,” said Pitt freshman and
guard Ashton Gibbs, “is crazy. Knowing
that they’re on your side makes the game
a lot more intense”

The fact that home teams win more
than opponents is obvious Since the
opening of the Petersen Events Center
in 2002, the Pitt men’s basketball team
holds a 112-10 record in front of its
home crowd. .

But it’s hard to understand why some
arenas and some audiences help to pro-

To understand how it happens, one

Sports psychologist Bill Cole, found—
er and president of the International
Mental Game Coaching Association,
says a home—court advantage starts with
the mindset of the players

“You only have the advantage if
you believe in the advantage,” said Cole.
“It’s all about how a player determines
the situation. You have to overcome the
belief that you’re under the microscope,
to come to terms with the fact with that
people are  you.” .

Gibbs hasn’t had a problem with that
this season.

“The crowd has always given me
a positive outlook on the game,” he
said “It’s great to play in front of these
fans” ‘

At the same time, though, the road

‘Angels’ in

Angels in America: Millen-
nium Approaches

Feb. 20 - March 1

Stephen Foster Memoria|'s Charity
Randall Theatre

412-694—PLAY

In the pursuit of excellence on
stage, The Pitt Repertory Theatre
is not afraid of a challenge and a
little controversy.

And with the ﬁnal show of its
season, Tony Kushner’s magnum
opus “Angels in America,” it is
certainly ﬁghting against both.

Starting Friday, Feb. 20, Pitt’s
premier theater ensemble will
stage part one of the epic play,
“Millennium Approaches,” with
part two, “Perestroika,” to be per-
formed in April. The two parts
have separate directors and casts,

Bands that dress the part rock the scene

 
  

by Justin Jacobs
A e5'E Editor

The spectrum of bands-
dressing—like—other—professions
is wide and varied, thanks in no
small part to The Village People.

But while most examples,
including The Decemberists-as-
librarians and Judas Priest-as-
bikers, are more circumstantial, a
new trend of bands—as—railroad—
workers carries a good bit more
significance than we’re used to in
this world of Kisses and Gwars.

Call me normal, but most
people don’t wear suspenders,
ragged plaid shirts, leatherwork
boots and tight workpants on
a daily basis. But for a growing
number of bands, this railroad
worker aesthetic, if you will, has
as much to do with style as mu-
sic. Let me explain.

For bands like Dr. Dog, Lim-

beck and Delta Spirit (which
played a thunderous show at
Brillobox Tuesday night), music
and fashion are paired together
with one long thread — both
hark back to a time long, long
ago when none of the modern
Internet hype mattered and the
word “indie” didn’t exist.

The bands’ dress and music
reﬂect a denial of today’s music
industry Not in lyrics or attitude,
but rather in their shedding of
any adherence to trends that bog
down so many bands today.

Dr. Dog sounds like a rock
band from 1967 playing a concert
on a cloud, with ﬂoating melo-
dies and a toy piano matched
with garage drums, punchy 
riffs and lyrics about friends. The
band’s got no fewer than four
songs with the word “old” in the
title, and its members dress to
match — Dr. Dog’s iTunes page
even features members in over-
alls covered in railroad grease.

Delta Spirit even employs
back—in—the-day imagery to its
name — the spirit of the Mis-
sissippi Delta supposes itself
in each tune with the band’s
swampy Southern stomp, even if
it is from San Diego.

But the metaphor to run
with here is that of the railroad
worker —— both bands look like
they could put down their in-
struments and pick up a shovel
or a big axe and go lay out some
tracks. Through dressing like
railroad men, the notion is that
these bands live like vagabonds,
going where the music takes
them.

In that way, the sound and the
look meld perfectly into some-
thing timeless.

Both "Delta Spirit and Dr.
Dog, which have toured togeth-
er in what surely would’ve been
a show for the ages, sound and
look like they could exist decades
ago or decades in the future,

thereby casting aside any genre
or trend labels, any push to cat-
egorize them.

Whether either band did so
willfully, or if I’m overanalyz—
ing this completely, is irrelevant
— the bottom line is that when
a band becomes all—encompass—
ing, as in the music matches the
image matches the attitude, the
band becomes all the more be-
lievable.

Are Delta Spirit or Dr. Dog
actually made of dudes who used
to build railroads in the 1930s?
Of course not —— Spirit’s lead
singer Matt Vasquez looks like
he’s no older than 25 — but the
audience buys it without a sec-
ond thought because the whole
package is there.

And when a band is believ-
able, when the audience can
sense that the musicians believe
themselves, the music, no mat-
ter the genre, can blow you right
over.

save for two of the teacher artists playing
Roy Cohn and Ethel Rosenberg, who ap-
pear in both.

Set in the 19805 and subtitled “A Gay
Fantasia on National Themes,” the play
weaves the narratives of a wide assortment
of characters dealing with the emergence
of the AIDS crisis in the time of Reagan-
ornics.

“We talked about doing it for over a year,
and the original reason we wanted to is be-
cause it is a very important play — one of

the most important of the 20th century,”.

said director Holly Thuma, a Pitt teaching
artist. “It’s a real challenge for the actors
and a good learning experience for them.”
Throughout its more than three-hour
running time, stories involving real—life fig-
ures Roy Cohn and Ethel Rosenberg are
intertwined with those of a not-so-happily
married Mormon couple, a nurse who hap-
pens to be a drag queen, a struggling gay
couple and, of course, a couple of angels.
The emphasized themes are vast and
encompassing — from AIDS’ effect on
America and what it meant to be gay in the
1980s to more abstract, yet never underem-
phasized, ideas like the power of love and
human interconnectedness, the play has a

little bit of everything.

For Thuma, the play’s array of sociopo-
litical commentary could not be more rel-
evant in our post-Bush political climate.

“I want the audience to walk out think-
ing about the issues raised in the play,” she
said. “It’s about a very crucial time in his-
tory. Though it’s 2009, we still have a ways
to go as far as civil rights and acceptance
with the homosexual community.”

This is the ﬁrst time the play has been

performed in Pittsburgh in its entirety
[with both parts] since the national Broad-
way.tou.r in 1995.. _
A Because of the extensive technical work
required to put on the show, as well as its
more than three—hour length per part, it’s
understandable that the show is infrequent-
ly performed, and yet Thuma can’t think of
a more appropriate time.

“We have the design and tech staff right
now required for the whole thing, and we
thought, ‘If we are gonna do it, we are gon-
na do it big,”’ she said.

Thuma acknowledged the difficulty in
staging the show with a group of actors
who are not studying theater ‘at a conserva-
tory level. A

“We have students from all sorts of ma-

jors, from English to biology, so
it can be a challenge [for the ac-
tors] trying to balance the mate-
rial of the play with maintaining a
high GPA,” she said.

One such student is John Gra-
ham, a senior communications
major who considers theater his

true passion. In the production,’

Graham plays Prior Walter, a gay
man trying to salvage his relation-
ship after discovering he is HIV-
positive.

“I was thrilled when I found
out we were doing ‘Angels,’ be-
cause I love the play,” he said. “I
was surprised because it is such a
mammoth production, but I was
never worried.”

To earn the part, Graham en-
dured “the most intense audition-
ing process of my time at Pitt.

At times, it felt like ‘American
Idol.’

“It’s the biggest challenge
I’ve ever had, acting wise. Deal-
ing with the material is incredibly

I draining, but I want to do the play

justice. It’s the most pressure I’ve
ever felt to do well,” he said.

In order to balance out the
overwhelming nature of the ma-
terial, Graham said that loosening
up and joking around with the
tight-knit cast backstage is a big
help, along with relaxing with his

iPod,at the end of the day.
Thuma understands the po-
tential strain such a thematic
show can have on actors, but she
said it’s been a more positive ex-

perience than anything.
“It’s the kind of material you

love to work on because you can
sink your teeth into it. Actors
love it, even if it’s a little disturb-
ing sometimes,” she said. “The
cast is wonderful. I can’t stress
enough how much effort is going
into the production from the en-
tire department.”

Graham emphasized the spec-
tacular technical aspects of the
show and thinks the “lighting
design, sets, music —- everything
— goes above and beyond what
anyone could expect. It’s going to
blow people away.”

“The play illustrates the idea
that everyone is inexorably con-
nected to one another, even if it’s
in an unusual way,” said Thuma.
“I hope students walk out with an
understanding that homosexual
love is as Valid as any love. Two
men kissing on stage is as roman-
tic and beautiful as any love could
be.”

The show is playing at the
Charity Randall Theatre and stu-
dent tickets are $12.

Zellous helps Pitt bounce
back, handle Wildcats

by Emily Steiner
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt senior guard Shavonte Zellous

is the natiorfs third leading scorer for

. good reason. During Pitt’s rnatchup
against Villanova Wednesday night, she
proved Why-

Zellous, who was recently named
the Dapper Dan Sportswoman of the
Year, scored23pointsandadded10re—
bounds,  propel No 19 Pitt past

’ Vllanova 70-54 at the Petersen Events
Center.

Zellous scored the ﬁrst: nine points
for the Panthers By halftime, she single-
handedly scored nearly as many points
as Villanova.

Zellous started the game hot, but
Pitt (195, 9-3) as a team started off
slow, as the Wﬂdcats (17-9, 9-3) led for
much of the first half It wasn’t until
Kate Popovec scored nine minutes into
the game that any member of the team

other than Zellous showed  of life

At that point, Pitt started work-
ingits benehplayers. Intheend,those

playershelpedPittgetbackonitsfeet,.

with Popovec and Chelsea Cole as main
connjbutors

Pitt saw its ﬁrst lead of the game
after a layup from Cole brought the
score to 13-12. Cole scored  sev-
eralminuteslateronafreethrowthat
gavePitta20-16 lead—its biggestlead
of thegameatthe time. Italsogavethe
team the goaheadtonmaxxvaywidi the
game, and Pitt led the rest of the game

intheBigEaststandings—aspotthat
the Wildcats previously held.

‘Tonightfs win was really great,” said
Pitt coach Agnus Berenatot ‘We were
in fourthplaceinthe BigEast, andwe
wanted what they had. Novig the tides
are turned”

At halftime, Zellous had 17 points,
and Pitt led 34-24.

The second half saw a much differ-
ent game

V1llanova’s Laura Kuiz started the
half on a scoring rampage, after 
alrmdyscored14pointsintheﬁrsthal£
She stepped on the ﬂoor and imme-
diately soored ﬁve. Followed by points

from Lisa Karicic, Maria Gerry and
Kutz, Vllanova  came within
one at 37-36. Still, as close as they got;
the \X/ildcats never led.

“We just have a tough time sustain-
ing olfense,’ ’ said Vllanova coach Harry
Perretta.

Kurz continued to dominate for
most of the second half while Zellous
remained quiet; But Pitt held on to the
lead with the majority or the team’s
points coming from Xenia Stewart,
who scoredseveneadyinthehalfand
ﬁnished with 11 in the game

Despite Kurz’s strong showing
— she scored a career—high 35 inthe
contest —— Pitt used a strong defense to
limit Villanova to only two 3—pointers in
the game

Kurz was  the only offen-

sive force on the Wildcats’ team, as their 3

second-leading scorer put up seven in
the game
Popovec followed Zellous in scor-
ingwith 12 points and nine rebounds

Pitt senior guard Shavonte Zellous led Pitt with 25 points and 10
rebounds to help Pitt take down Villanova 70-54 on Wednesday night.
