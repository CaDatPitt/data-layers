Ciassducs are being co|lcct- -
ed today on the Heinz House
walk. At a meeting of presi-
dents last Friday it was decid-
ed that all woman’: classes
should make a drive for their
funds on’ one day, setting ta-
bles with a representative from
each class to collcctthe fee of
ﬁfty cent: from each member.

This is the first year that a
cooperative drive has .bc.en‘ cr-
ganizcd by the classes. It is
the first step in W. S. G? ‘A.’c
campaign to strengthen the

. class organizations and encour-
age a greater spirit of cooper-
ation among the classes than
has’ existed in the past. The
presld-ents.cf the ’thrce\__upper ‘
classes have met to plan a pro-
gram for the year which- will

party for the classes together.
‘ Since the freshman officers
have not been elected vet, the
collection of their duecwll-i be.
handled by the senior -class.
The election of the freshman
office-rs will take -place in aifew -

- weeks. and it is urged that every .
freshman shall pay her due:
before she yotes.

At many, colleges the classes
receive ‘the first loyalty of the,
coeds, but it is only recently
that Pitt has undertaken to die;

velopl the possibilities on our
own campus. it icirccognized
thartthlc type of organization
will reach every woman stu-
dent, thus obtaining a wider '
scope. .

The class presidents, Elean-

besides her usual $5.50 Eugenie wave, offers a permanent
wave for $2.00 as a special this week.

IN THESE days of depression, bargains are more attrac-
tive than ever. J. Aiello, the jeweler at 3911 Forbes street in
Oakland, makes a double offer this week, an offer that is
bound to appeal to students. A bottle of ink is given away
with every fountain pen purchased from his shop. And,
by the way, have you seen the little hand-made gold-plated

show-case; it is a genuine exhibi-

tion of his craftsmanship.

Boxing Meet

Hold Practice Sessions
With Varsity Squad

different from those of the past
when they enter fraternity houses
this year for the express punpose
of dancing with the brothers, for
the latter unanimously voted at a.
meeting of interfraternity council
Tuesday evening to cooperate with
Joe Orsini, Pitt boxing coach, who
is sponsoring the ﬂrst interfratern-
ity boxing tournament ever held at
the University.

Coach Orsini believes that the
new sport will prove mode arduous
upon the brothers than their former
afternoon's favorite, bridge, but
after they have accustomed them-
selves to the new pastime, it will
supplant all other forms of recrea-
tion.

Practice for the fraters will be
held du-ring the varsity and fresh-
man teams’ training period which
begins Tuesday in the track house.
All fraternity men will be accorded
the same privileges as the regular
candidates for the teams, and they
will be permitted to use the teams’
equipment to prepare themselves
for the tournament.

Start December.

Elimination will begin during the
early part of December. Bouts will
be conducted according to intercom-
legiate rules which call for three
two-minute rounds or less with a
minute's intermission between
each. If one of the ﬁghters is
greatly outclassed by another, the
bout will be stopped.

Although no deﬁnite system of
awarding points has as yet been
determined, Orsini believes that
the probable scale’ will be ﬁve
points for the winner, three points
for the runner-up. and one point
each for the ﬁghters defeated in
the semi-ﬁnal -bouts.

Each of the ﬁnalists will receive
a medal, and the fraternity scoring
the highest number of points will
receive a trophy.

Through this tournament, Orsini
hopes to lﬂlnd more material for his
boxing team. He believes that there
are many promising men who did
not come out for the team last year,
and he is conﬁdent of discovering
these men by means of the tourna-
ment.

Pbysed Major Group
 ,Shows"Gain To 140
Seven hundred and three stu-

dents have registered for fresh-
man physical education courses.

This is a drop of 140 from the

number registered in the ﬂrst se-
mester of the 1930-31 session.

In contrast to the drop in fresh-
man registration, is the fact that
the number of physical education
department majors has increased.
For this semester a total of 140
students have registered, while in
the corresponding semesterof last
year only 120 took the physical
education major course.

Sop}: Tennis Stars
Strengthen Varsity

 

Although the coming tennis cam-
paign will not find Eddie Jacobs,
the former captain, a participant,
prospects are bright. Eddie Alcorn
has been given the assignment of
ﬁlling the vacancy left by Jacobs.

The team win consist of such
players as Billy Jacobs, three times
national champion in the younger
division; Nate Ganger, Ohio sin-
gles champion; Irving Goodman,
who has proved himself a valuable
asset to the tennis team for the
past two years; Walter Adler, also
a dependable player in the past,
and possibly Billy O’Loughlin,
who has not been in action for the
school since his freshman year.

Not much will be known con-
cerning the freshman team until
the coming spring. In the past, the
freshmen have earned their share
of honors by winning practically
every match played, as well as
producing some fine players fbr
the varsity.

a beautiful Panther at the bottom.
Holders of tickets for the Nebras-

ground. Tickets for the Tech game

The tickets for the Army game

Doc Carlson Confident

iDespite Tough Schedule.

 

By HOMER WADSWORTH

“We’ll win ’em all,” says Dr.
Carlson, eminent Braddock phy-
sician, and famous Panther bas-
ketball coach, in speaking of the
coming season on the hardwood
for his traveling basketeers. And
unless you’re a dyed-in-the-wool
Carlsonite, you'll say he's crazy,
what with -a. thirty-game schedule
that will see the Pitt cagers on
the court from the Atlantic to the
Paciﬁc seaboard!

What a man, this sorrel-topped
medico, with his amazing basket-
ball theories, his super-optimism,
and his never-say-die spirit. Tack-
ling the hardest schedule any has-
ketball team ever attempted means
nothing to Doc Carlson. Didn't he
lose one of the greatest basketball
players that ever slipped on a pair
of basketball shoes, and then turn

ble winners of the Tournament
known before the end of next
week.

The semi-ﬁnal round will be.
played on Monday with the cham-
pion decided on Wednesday when
the ﬁnals will be played.

Of the three matches in the ﬁrst
round Lambda Chi Alpha defeated
Theta Kappa Nu, Delta Sigma Phi
defeated Kappa Sigma, winner of
the Tournament two years ago, and
Alpha Phi Delta lost to Omega
Delta.

Most of the matches in the sec-
ond round have been played thus
far. Phi Epsilon Pi defeated Sig-
ma Chi in two straight matches.
Sigma Alpha Mu won from Theta
Delta Psi by default. Lambda Chi
Alpha lost its second round battle
to Phi Kappa, and Phi Delta Theta
and Phi Gamma Delta were tied
at one all at the conclusion of two
singles matches. The winner in
that match was decided Wednes-

are shown.

your last dollar that from the
opening whistle “Doc's” charges
will reveal even -more startling
revelations in this system type of

That Carlson's style of play is
highly effective has been proved
in the way his charges, though

The men’s shower room at Trees

Gym has been greatly improved.
In place of the old rough cement

brand new showers, and a non-skid

The Physical Ed department is

thing about this fellow Carlson,
for you’ll ﬁnld it just doesn't work.

Enough for the good doctor, Un-
doubtedly the absence of former
Cocaptains Eddie Baker and Wil-
lie Arture will be sorely felt. How-
ever, the presence of Co-Captains
Tommy Lawry an Bill Kowallis,
Bus Allbright, Don Smith, Steve
Kowallis, and several promising
freshmen from last year, including
MaCamant, Ochsenhirt, McBride,
Hughes, and Hunt provide Carlson
with a squad of experienced men.

turned, and should see consider-
able action.

Pitt Harriers
Await Opener

Allegheny College First
Opponent

 

The University of Pittsburgh
cross country team awaits its first
meet with confidence. The initial
meet takes place on October 10,
with Allegheny College at Schen-
ley Park. Other meets will be held
with Syracuse, West Virginia,
Penn State, Carnegie Tech and
Army. The meet with Army will
mark the ﬁrst time that Army has
ever been met in cross-country.

The schedule includes some of
the best squads in the east, but
the Panther material is strong.
The varsity men include Captain
Thiele, Tapp, Santicola, Clise, and
Smoyer, while Watkins and Law-
rence are coming up from the

freshmen. As yet Coach.Shea has
taken no time trials, but he will do
so soon.

For-ego I. 0.. 4A Meet

Due to a conﬂict in the schedule,
the varsity team will not be able
to compete in the Intercollegiate
meet at New York this year. How-
ever, if the freshmen make a good
showing during the season, they
will be allowed to enter the I. C.
4A meet.

Places on the squads are still
open, and anyone can still come
out for the team. There are good
openings for managerial positions,
a so.

voted a prominent part of the

Many Factors
Aid Pitt Cause

 

BY THE CAMPUS scour
After a week of propaganda, moanings, lamentations and

what have you on the pa.rt of

Jock Sutherland, Pitt football

coach, in which the good doctor has found innumerable faults
with a team which ran up 61 points the week previous against
a school which never before had been beaten by more than
three touchdowns, the same coach will send a team on the ﬁeld
tomorrow against Iowa, and despite the fact that Jock tells his
conﬁdential friends that he will consider his season a success

if his team holds Iowa down to two¢
touchdowns, Pitt should ﬁnish the
game on the long end of a 27-7
score. Of course, there is a chance
that the Iowans will not score, so
we will give the reader another al-
ternative IJJDOII which to bet, 20-0.

People around the campus will
probably tell me that I’m crazy.
Isn't Iowa a “Big Ten” team?
Doesn’t it have fourteen lettermen
from last year's team on this year's
squad? Aren't the boys bigger
than our fellorws? I'll, take the
chance because anybody who tries
to predict scores is crazy whether
anybody tells him or not.

But to get to the point, there are
several factors which seem to make
a Pitt victory certain.

Suspension Hurts.

Iowa was suspended from the
Western Conference two years ago
for alleged violation of the code,
or whatever they call those rules
which govern the conduct of the
brothers. In order to be reinstated,
the Hawkeyes were forced to de-
clare several of their outstanding
players ineligible for further com-
petition. This fact not only robbed
them of some of the best players
then in school, but the fact that
they were not reinstated into the
Big Ten until late last spring
caused some of the best high school
football players in that state to go
elsewhere so that last year's fresh-

A

man team was not what it might
have been, and consequently, the
present sophomores will not be as
great a help to Coach Bert Ingwer-
son of the llllawkeyes as they might
have been.

Robert Zuppke, coach of the Illi-
nois team in the “Big Ten,” picks
Iowans to ﬁnish in the second di-
vision. Such being the case. the
Westerners can hardly hope to com-
pete on even terms with a team
as strong as the Panthers are this
season, even though the Western
Conference is the strongest group
of its kind in the country and a
team which finishes in the second
division there is usually stronger
than many of the leading teams in
the East.

‘Much of the propaganda spread
by the Panther publicity depa-rt-
ment has dealt on the fact that
Pitt will not be in its true stride
when it encounters the Iowans due
to the fact that the practice ses-
sions at Camp Hamilton were
started one week later this year
than has been the custom in the
past. If this is the case, then the
Iowans are doubly handicapped for
they did not start practicing until
September 16, eight days after the
Panthers had congregated at their
training quarters; and’ the Panthers
have had the beneﬁt of playing a
game in which their coach had the
opportunity of ﬁnding their rough
spots whereas the Hawkeyes will
be playing their inaugural when
they face the Panthers tomorrow.

‘Panthers Strong.

Many fans attributed the suc-
cess of the Panthers against Miami
in their opening tilt last week more
to the inability of the -Ohioans to
furnish them tough competition
than to any exceptional ability on
the part of the Pitt players. If the
time were but one year in advance
of the present date, we would ‘be
content to believe their remarks;
but after seeing that one class A
team could administer a severe
drubbing to another class A outfit
with such apparent ease as marked
Notre Dame's victory over Pitt last,
year at the stadium, we are prone
to believe that Miami would. bg
able to give many Class A teams: a,
hard ﬁght but that when it faced
the Panthers, it was as hopeless
against their attack as Pitt was
against Notre Dame's. ‘

And if there is anybody in the

‘ crowd who still doubts the conclu-

siveness of these deductions, I w h
to refer him to the experience. 1.‘
the d'1ﬂ‘91'6I1t Dlayers who will meet
on the gridiron tomorrow. Those
fourteen Iowan lettermen about
whom you have read since early
summer, are all juniors with but
One year of varsity experience,
while Pitt will have eight senidrs
in its lineup when tomorrow's game
commences. ‘ ‘

Irrelevant Subjects

T IS REASONABLE to sup-
pose now that ‘the rush of
registration and all of its at-
tendant woes have been put
out of the way, that many Pitt
undergraduates will ask them-
selves what good is to be ob-
tained from some apparently
irrelevant subject, included
among the required studies in
their courses. ,
“How is it connected with
my business or my profession-
al‘ career?” is the question
most usually asked by the im-
patient ones. -
3 That the particular subject
in question has little practical
 application to the profession
for which he is studying may
be granted. Yet quizzical stu-
dents, who strain to break
- away from these so-called ir-
relevant courses, should have
faith in"the faculty members’
who put them into the course
of study. They did not do it
simply to give an instructor a.
position or to use an idle class
room. Time and space‘ are too
valuable for that. - 0 °
The faculty probably did it
because it realizes that medi-
ocrity and quackery result
from the exclusive pursuit of
' studies that have an immedi-
ate connection with the stu-.
dent's career. The administra-
tion wants to give the student
a more rounded development.
As a prominent educator re- *
cently  observed, students
should be made to understand.
that the great man is not sat--*
isﬁed nor inﬂuenced by the
immediate and applicable-. He
must‘ have some‘ theory and ‘
speculation to mix with his
cold facts. ‘

Doumtoum Division
Adds Extra Rooms

With the opening of the fall
semester the Downtown Division
has occupied, in addition‘ to the
rooms on the tenth floor of the
Chamber of Commerce Building,
two rooms’ on the seventh ﬂoor.

While the newispace on the sev-
enth floor will be divided into
three classrooms, only two of them
will be occupied by the Downtown
Division. The .cther room will be
used by the University Law School.

In addition to the space occupied
in the Chamber of Commerce Build-
ing, the Downtown Division also
uses four rooms, in the Duquesne
Building, located immediately in
the rear of the Joseph Home Com-

pany, with an entrance on Cecil
place.

In addition to -this, an office to
be occupied by J. Lloyd Mahoiu-y,
assistant professor of ﬁnance, who
is in charge of the details of the
Chartered Life Underwriters edu-
cational program, is to be built
next to that now occupied by Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, director.

.To increase the eﬁciency of the
Downtown Division, in direct tele-
phone line has been ‘installed be-

“Gentlemen, welcome! Ladies,
that have their toes unplagued with
corns,. will have a bout with you
. . . Come musicians, play. A
hall! a hall! give room, and foot
it, girls." ' , .
If you happen to know your
Shakespeare. you I will recognize
these lines as coming. from "Ro-
meo and Juliet,” and if you hap-
pened to sit'in the auditorium 01
a Minneapolis theater one evening
about seven years ago, you would
recognize, in the bearded Father
Capulet who was littering those
words, our own Carl Cass, director
of Pitt Players. ,

As Father Capulet came to the
end of his speech, a young damsel
who had until then stood poised at

the center of the stage, began to
descend.
wooden slat, which served to rein-
force the -arch overliead,’ came
loose and struck her behind the
head, sending her ‘ spinning down
the stairs and onto the stage. Be-
fore the feet of an amazed Father
Capulet, she came to a stop, ‘un-
conscious. I
But Carl Cass was not a con-
stant smoker of a. well-known
cigaret for naught; in his embar-
rassing moment he was nonchal-
ant.» “What. he! What hol”. he
bellowed, in an effort to keep up
the dialogue and at the same time
attract the attention of two ‘of the
servants on the, stage. After a

latter caught the idea, picked up
the ‘prostrate girl and carried her
out through the wings.‘

In wild West.

Another highlight of Mr. Cass’
lengthy experience before the foot-
lights occurred about eight years
ago in a western theater. His
company was playing on a, stage
which was divided into two levels.
Standing in the wing Mr. Cass no-
ticed one of the girls backstage
slip off the higher level. fall be-
hind some scenery and-lie motion-
less. At the same time he heard
his cue from the stage.

he was torn between, his desire to
go to the girl's aid, and the su-
preme law of the stage, “The show
-must go on.” ’ ’- ’

His alarmed fellow actors on the
stage repeated the cue. His show-'
manship conquered and he wan-
dered out on .the stage, muttering
his’ lines. However, his mind was
in such tormoil that he soon forgot
his lines and the curtain had to be
pulled. Of course he immediately

had swooned from 3. turned ankle!

We wantvto, pause long enough
in the general trend and whirl of
events to talk about three books,
three books that aren’t-- new (at

least not in the sense of being just
off the press) but three books
whose ‘interest and importance are
growing weekly, especially in the
precincts of Alumni Hall. -

They are the three members of
Dmitri Merejkowski’s Trilogy:
“The Death of ‘the Gods,” “The
Romance of Leonardo da Vinci"
and “Peter and Alexis.” The “Ro-
mance” is the most popular one. A
month or so gone the Literary
Guild .made it one of the chosen

piece. Perhaps it is the most in
triguing of~the three, but were-
sent that the Trilology should be
divided, that anybody who likes
Merejkowski at all shouldn't read
him from -the first to the last.

Morgantown. W. Va.—-With the initial
battle against Duquesne safely tucked
away Coach “Greasy" Neale’s varsity foot-
ball team began preparation for his Sat-
urday’: ‘c‘ussle with the Fordham “Rams"
in New York City. This game is one of
the hardest the Nealemen will face this
season. as Fordham has one of the out-
standing teams in the East.

The “Mountaineers" looked impressive in
their offensive game Saturday, but showed
a marked weakness in pass defensive, as
the “Dukes" completed twelve of the two
dozen attempted forwards. The varsity
line was exceptionally strong in the in-
augural game, with the “Duke" running
attack being virtually smothered through-
out the game.

State College, Pa.-—-Unable to check the
passing attack of the Waynesburg Yellow
Jackets, Penn State's grid team dropped
its opening game of the 1931 season by a
7-to-0 score on New Beaver ﬁeld Saturday
afternoon.

Although Coach Bob Higgins’ team out-
shone its opponents in number of ﬁrst
downs registered, by a 10-to—7 count, there
is little doubt that Coach Frank Wolf's
proteges earned their victory, the second
l:‘hat'the Western Pennsylvania. institution
has gained in State College in less than
a year.

Through the ﬁne running of Rab Currie
and the accurate passing of Johnny Ross
the Yellow Jackets managed to snatch
from the grasp of the Lions, a victory
which means much to any comparatively
new team at the opening of a season.

 

Cleveland, Ohio.——Western Reserve Uni-
versity opens its football season with Pur-
due at Lafayette, Ind., October 3. This is
a tough assignment for the Cleveland Red
Cats. Purdue is said to have the strong-
est team in the Big Ten, and Reserve’:
team is not outstanding this year. The
new coaches, Tom Keady, “Jiggs” Dona-
hue and John Dreshar, are hopeful of
keeping the score down, but are making

~no -predictions.

 

As a result of the poor showing made
by the Tech eleven in its season's opener
against Buﬂalo last Saturday. the Tartans
have been thoroughly drilled in the funda-
mentals of the game during the past week.

It had been expected that the team would

_ be put through some of the more compli-

cated plays and formations which it will
need later in the season, but Coach Wad-
del-l. ‘who is in charge of the squad since

' Wally Stefl‘.en’s return to Chicago, deter-

mined to have the players brush up on in-
terfering, tackling, blocking and passing.
Waddell has been working the boys hard,
keeping them on until long after dark and
drilling them under the ﬂoodlights.

 

Lincoln, Nebr. -—Coac‘h Dana X. Bible
seemed very well satisﬁed with the work
of the Cornhuskers in their 44 to 6 victory
over South Dakota last Saturday. Prepa-
rations are now being made for the game
this week with Northwestern University at
Evanston.

Nebraska's one hope this year lies in the
work of the sophomores. If the game Sat-
urday was any indication, the Huskers

.. shouldgo a long way. A sophomore back-

ﬁeld, composed of Sauer, Bauer, Boswell
and. Mastierson was the high light of the
‘game. Going in shortly after the second
quarter started, this group of second-year
men, alternating passing and running
plays put the ball over for a touchdown
in legs than two minutes.‘ All four of the

men are accurate passers, can run with.

the ball and know plenty about blocking.
Three of them, Sauer, Bauer and Master-
aon, played together all during their high
school days at Lincoln, while all four
were together on the frosh team last year.

Open Season

Pitt Starting Lineup
Uncertain

Pitt. football fans will have a bet-
ter idea of the players to repre-
sent them in the next three years
after the freshman team's inaug-
ural game tomorrow afternoon
with Wyoming Seminary, a. new-
comer on the schedule, at Kings-
ton, Pa.

Most of the players come to Pitt
with great high school records be-
hind them, and coach “Skip”
Gougler of the freshman team is
conﬁdent that the boys will con-
tinue their earlier success at the
University.

Competition for the positions on
the team has been unusually keen,
and the coach is still dubious about
his starting lineup. He has two
good men for practically every po-
sition on the team.

Shotwell and Oleo are the lead-
ing center candidates. Kutz and
Victor are running neck and neck
for the right guard berth while
Ken Ormiston is leading in the
race for the other guard position.
Kopolovich and Thompson are
struggling for the starting right
tackle berth, with Hoel apparently
set on the other side of the line.
Louie, Pipoly, Wilkins, and Selfert
are the leading candidates for the
terminal positions.

I Backs Available.

In the backﬁeld, Rucker and
Bolasia lead other signal barking
aspirants. Weinstock is apparent-
ly set to do the plunging with Nick
Niksitch and Smith left halfback
candidates and Wiesenbaugh and
Musjan battling for the other back-
ﬂeld post.

As yet, the players, who come
from all sections of -the tri-state
area, have not yet become accus-
tomed to each other, a condition
which may hamper them in their
earlier games; but only a few
more practice sessions are needed
before the boys will be playing like
old pals.

To the Cause

A pep rally will be held Fri-I
day, October 9, in Memorial
Hall in anticipation of the
West Virginia game at the
stadium the followirig after-
noon. according to a state-
ment made this week by John
W. Sterling, Eng. '32, chair-
man of the student council
assembly committee.

The cheerleaders and the
band will be on the stage to
lead the students in cheer
and song. As an added at-
traction, Mr. Stirling has
promised that there will be
no speakers.

Twenty-Five Answer
Call For Rifle Team

The answer to the call for can-
didates for the riﬂe team was very
disappointing. Only 25 students
came out for the team on the first
day when 75 were expected by
Coach Lieutenant Wilson and Cap-
tain Backen.

Inianticipation of the addition
that will be made soon to the
range in the Stadium, the squad
has been increased from 10 to 15
men. Of the 15 positions, fully 11
are open to competition and any
man will have an excellent chance
of winning one. Each of the 15
riders will have an opportunity of
earning a minor letter- In order
to acquire a letter, the shooter
must ﬁnish among the first ﬁve
in at least three-fourths of the
matches. ‘

Last year the riﬂers were helped
so greatly by the enlarging and
bettering of the shooting facilities
that they had the best season in
the- history of the University.
Their record was 12 won and 8
lost; and, in addition, the team
standing was jumped nationally
from nineteenth place to eighth
place. It also set a new high score
record for the University.

In a way, you cannot blame Jock

ballyhoo praising the Panthers
will only cause the fans to demand
more of a. team than they would if
straight news formed the only ar-

Miami Team  
Praises Pitt

Defeated Redskins Laud
Panther Grid Stars

“We just couldn’t get started
against Pitt’s line,” is the only
alibi offered by Miami after their
disastrous defeat by the Panthers
last Saturday.

Although they had never before
been beaten by more than three
touchdowns, the Miami dressing
room presented an altogether dif-
ferent scene than might be ex-
pected from a. team that had just
suffered a. 61-0 setback. “We just
couldn’t get near them,” was the
only comment offered by Niemi,
Miami’s star end. The general

‘opinion of the team in general,

was “Pitt will go a long way this
season.”

Ma.cMurdo, Daugherty, Heller,
and Reider received special praise
from the defeated “Redskins.”

Pitt Boys Happy

Congratulations were in order in
the Pitt dressing room, with such
well known phrases as: ‘The old
ﬁght,” “Nice going, old pal," and
the familiar, “Yeah,” leading all
others. “Only eight more to go,”
said one husky in blue striped
running pants, and the words were
echoed by the others.

According to Coach Sutherland,
the team hasn’t played football
yet, for Miami didn’t offer any op-
position- He hesitates to give an
outcome on future games, declar-
ing that the Panthers still have to
meet a strong team.

“Such a play as the one pulled
by Pitt on the kickoff inspires. a
team, and a play like that usually
determines a football game,” was
the comment offered by Assistant
Coach Eddie Baker.

Ten Cl/'eter¢izn.sA_lIii’eturn
To Pitt Boxing Squad

With the return of all the mem-
bers of last year’s squad, and the
probable acquisition of new ma-
terial, the outlook for boxing this
season is extremely good, although
it is too early to make any rash
predictions. First practice has
been set for Tuesday, October 6.
At this time, Coach Joe Orsini will
meet all candidates at the track
house, and give a. short drill on
the fundamentals. Practice will be
held at regular intervals after
Tuesday.

Conti, Patterson, Malutes. Brad-
ley. Santicola, Shricker, Zimmer-
man, Martin, Tommins, and Luch
from last year's squad are back
this year, and Hy Linten, Jerry
Glick, and Bob Stevenson, from
Orsini’s gym classes are expected
to be candidates. Paul (Rip) Col-
lins, grid star, who has had box-
ing experience, is also expected
to try out for the team.

“Although we have all the mem-
bers of last year’s squad back,”
said Coach Orsini, “that is no in-
dication that anyone ls a. regular.
Any light-heavyweight (175-180
pounds)‘ is especially welcome, as
we will need more than one light-
heavy on our squad. We have an
especially hard season ahead of
us, with no set-ups on our card;
and we will need every possible
man.” ’ ,

Coach Corr To Have
Experienced Squad

Coach Pat Corr will give the
swimming team its first practice
of the year next Monday at Trees
Gym pool. The candidates for both
the varsity and freshman squads
will be present. _

The varsity squad is expected to
show great strength this year, as

Joe Schmieler. Ray Cogswell and
John Reilly remain from last year.

tory of Pitt swimming that the

ridge, backstroke and free-style
expert, has been captain. Patton
specializes in the back stroke,
while Schmieler is an all-around
star. -

Herman Adlersberg looked good
in his swimming for the freshmen
last year and is expected to be a
great aid to Corr. Carik will proba-
bly assume the diving duties while
on the varsity,

Jack Hanna, who is just about
the best long distance free-styler
in these Darts. Will bear the brunt
of the work in the longer events.
Joe Schmieler is expected to han-
dle the breast stroke capably, and
Ray Cogswell, John Reilly, Wayne
Larimer. and “Vic” Garvey will
round out the team nicely.

The freshmen have some likely-
looklng prospects coming in, with
great things especially anticipated
from Jack Denny of Westinghouse.
Others who will swim are Irving
Davies, also of Westinghouse, Paul
Stimmer from Duquesne High,
Fred Warren from Canton, Ohio,
and Osterling from Coraopol-is.
