University Prepares

School Council Plan

Pitt will undertake University-wide program to establish
school councils here in the near future, according to Assistant

Chancellor Charles Peake.

This program will replace the class officers set—up.
Peake says “The new plan provides for each school to
have an ofﬁcial student organization or cabinet made up of

officers elected from each class’

Objectives Listed

“Thus, the academic unit be-
comes the basis for class organi-
zation and for increased student
participation in the unfolding
plans and operation of the Uni—

?’ veiuity."

Some of the objectives of
school councils or cabinets are
to promote student loyalty to
each school, to provide commu-
nication between students and
their deans and faculties.

To provide official means of
communication between the Uni-
versity Administration and the
students in the various schools,
to promote greater understanding
of the educational objectives, pro-
fessional goals, and curricular
plans and programs within each
school and within the University.

To provide‘ official leadership

for the promotion of student ac-

,_ tivities and programs within each

school and to provide further op-
portunities for students at all
levels to participate in signiﬁcant
group undertakings.

Provide Vital Channels

Peake adds, “The school cabi-
nets will provide official channels
for the discussion of‘ educational
problems -and for the expression

of student interests and needs
as related to their particular
school.

“In addition the cabinets will
provide the organizational basis
for social events of the various
school classes. A number of
such school organizations al-
ready exist, and the present
plan merely extends them to all
schools of the University.”

The responsibilities and pro-
cedures of these organizations will
be that each dean is the official
sponsor of the council within his
school.

He may act as official adviser
himself or appoint a well—quali-

IFC Adopts
Delegation
Amendment

By EDWIN ZINMAN

Interfraternity Council ap-
proved at Wednesday’s meet-
ing a constitutional amend-
ment providing for equal
representation of all 19 mem-
ber fraternities.

As required by the constitution,
this was the second consecutive
meeting in which the amendment
received a majority vote.

Representation of each fratern-
ity shall be two official delegates,

of which one must be the presi-
dent and the other a non-senior.

Previously, delegation and

« voting strength was determined
by strength of the membership
roster. As a result the larger
fraternities suffered g r e a t e r
ﬁnancial obligation to IFC, but

now ﬁnancial matters will be‘

assessed -equally.

IFC has extended its planned
Kennywood picnic to include all
interested University students.
The picnic is slated for Tuesday,
May 20 all day.

Amusement tickets may be pur-
chased at discount prices. IFC will
be the sole group attending
Kennywood that day.

President Ala n Papernick,
Col. ’59, announced that the
hitherto elected‘ ﬁve man IFC
Judicial Commission would be
appointed by the executive com-
mittee.

His reasons were that the pre-

weather conditions.

D u r i n g intermission, trophies
will be presented for the carnival
shows and booths.

Tickets are now on sale at the

“This is the second year of the

fellowship. There is also an Eng-
lish‘ counterpart of the award
It allows two. British medical stu-
dents to come to Pittsburgh to
study a ‘medical specialty during
the summer. It is based on schol-
arship and extracurricular activi-
ties.

In commenting on the short
time they will have to study, Wil-
kins and lKlieger, said, “By nar-
rowing study down to one partic-
ular area and studying under a

_able to get educational experi-
- ence which will prove invaluable

in the future.

They are active in the Stu-
dent American Medical Asso-
ciation chapter here. Wilkins is
’the chapter treasurer while
Klieger was chairman of the In-
ternship Evaluation Committee.

A   School Organization

The new program of school councils is another indica-
tion of progress at the University. It will inﬂuence identiﬁ-

 cation with school to a greater extent than the class oﬁicer

system accomplished.‘ 

The only question which comes to mind in consideration
of the proposed changes is how the heterogeneous college
can be truly iiniﬁed under such a program.

Engineering and Mines Cabinet serves as a striking ex-
ample of how successful a school council can be. But engi-

"neers have closer bonds of attachment than those of the

diverse major ﬁelds in the college.
Nevertheless the centralization of the school council
system is noteworthy and coupled" with it is the possibility

of‘? school councils or corresponding sets of class officers,
, working together for certain functions. '

Responsibility of the dean of the school to each of the
councils is an excellent idea in that.this detaches the of-

wﬁcers from the stigma of being considered merely another

minor activity role. , _ ,
Class ‘ofﬁcer system is restored to a new heightened im-
portance in the academic unit and will provide a better con-

’ ception of how they ﬁt into the total University scheme.

Problems of class oﬁicers seizing for themselves what
should be Men’s Council or AWS business for lack of some-
thing to do would be eliminated.

School council‘ will fulﬁll a deﬁnite academic function
in addition to their social function. There has long been a
need for a group of interested students in each school to
meet officially to discuss mutual educational problems.

i Most schools, again with the exception of the enigmatic:

college, have their own specialized needs and these should
be considered on a separate basis. J

Asthe need for total group events arises, the school
councils can be expected to band together for their mutual
beneﬁt. , ' ’

The Unsilent Generation

The .

(Editor’s Note: This is the third of three articles
on “The Unsilent Generation” a book written by
Princeton seniors. The first two dealt with the
predominant negative aspects of the book, the
third with the only two promising articles.)

The two Princetonians who show constructive
and deep thinking in their articlesiare relegated to
the end of the volume for some unexplainable
reason. .

“A Libera1’s Progress” seems genuinely brilliant
except for its religious thoughts

ton racial bias.

This individual is Jewish, but
in name only. He claims that the
encounter with anti-semitism
drives some Jews toward their
religion but “this did not happen
in my case.”

“Probably” if I had remained
in the great city, surrounded by
other Jews, the drift would never
have begun.” Most Jews, the
Princetonian claims, are “nominal members” and
generally indifferent to the religious aspects of
Judaism. H

His boyhood he calls “the education of a liberal.”
All conservatives were to him “selﬁsh, vicious, or
stupid.” .

Liberal Halres Bohemians
‘He was taught to be good for goodness’ sake

 

rather than speciﬁcally for‘ God’s sake. He neces-
sarily is quite disturbed as ‘are many college youths

with the juvenile delinquency and youthful irre-
sponsibility in general. ' /J

The Princetonian states that the “moral and ethi-
cal myopia” is not limited to youth. For instance,

“Political rhetoric could not grovel much more

deeply in the mud than .it does‘ no-w——on both sides
of the party fence.”

This liberal thinker dislikes violently the ‘‘bo- ‘\

hemian intellectual.” Aside from the attire and ego-
centricity of this individual, he believes that a chief
form of pleasure for the bohemian is “America-
baiting.” ~ ~» . -i , . _

This refers to the attitude of the bohemian that

A it must ‘be, bad if‘ found in America. Conformity, ‘
materialism, etc. are terrible; European things are

always good, regardless of the shambles theiFrench,
have made in Algeria. . _ ' .
Another personfwith whom the liberal contends is
the “intellectual in search of his soul.” He’s always
looking for meaning in life and often ends at either
of twocextremest denial of authority and set stand-

ards or acceptance of an authoritarian system" re--

lieving him of making decisions.

The soul saver is little better. The Princetonian
would feel better about mass evangelism if he
could be sure that the soul-savers concerned have
thought through carefully what they are attempt-
ing and the responses they get.

Crime Overlooked

“There must be a mean between the sanctimon-
ious and the amoral.” A third problem is the pre-
vailing attitude of “psychologists, psychiatrists, and
sociologists” to take antisocial conduct as a matter
of course and rationalize it away. ,

“We are often so busy understanding why a crime

has been committed that we forget that an evil?”

attack has been made upon civilized society, an at-
tack that should be severely punished.” Amen.

This Princetonian speaks for his fellow students
in the statement that many of them would enter
professions not particularly lucrative, but which
“promise their practitioners a real chance at so-
cially useful, soul-satisfying, and creative work.”

Perhaps the shortest article in the book, the last
selection, “The Third Eye,” is a very rational ap-
praisal ofthis generation. ,

Eye of Self-Criticism

“This is the generation of the third eye, the eye
of self-consciousness, the eye of self—criticism.
Whatever we do is subject to its gaze.” S

He ﬁnds the typical fear of the day centering
around a horror of ﬁnding ourselves ludicrous. We
are a bit jealous, says this thinker, of the twenties
with the freedom to join Communist cells, culti-
vate “Dadaist fads,” et. al.

However, “a Federal Reserve System” in our
imaginations protects us “from our parents’-glori-
ous ﬂop. - ~ ‘

Also, the fervor of social responsibility of the
thirties has been eliminated from our thoughts,
“another victim of an obsessively historical and
analytical point of view.”

the prevalent college opinion of communist theory:
“The real reason for our dislike of communism is
not our fear of nonconformity or our rejection of

. . its represumptive ungodliness.” Communists prin-

ciples simply ‘don’t offer an intellectual challenge to
“the triple eyed.” ' . ’ A

The Unsilent Generation shows its better points in
these .two provocative essays, so unlike the nine
preceding them. We even question the spontaneity
of the nine problem children. -

Systematic Reeclucation

By Nalhan Maryn

(Editor’s note: This is the first of a series on
"Soviet Education. It is based on information from
the U.S. and USSR governments.) ’

With the advent of the Sputnik and the ‘Ex-
plorer the education system of the USSR has been
held up, for investigation and comparison with our
own. ' h 

The Soviets are proud of" their system and read-
ily send out news releases and do newspaper and
magazine articles about it. They '
invite foreign educators to look 
at and practice in the system.

The item of most amazement
with regard to the system is that 
they‘ even allow the people with- 
in the system to criticize the
system (and this in.the land of j
the secret police). This permitted S
criticism is used for constructive
purposes and————because it gives
out no extremely vital or politi
cal information—is tolerated. .

Like many other features in Russia it has both
Marxist and Tsarist basis. _ _

From Marxism it gets its raison d’etre. The old
philosopher said in the “Communist Manifesto”
back in 1848 that the proletariat would have to

’ wrest power from the hands of the bourgeoisie.

Education was considered the tool of the exploit-
ing class to enable the workers to produce more.
By taking over the system the Communists would
remove this source of exploitation from the
bourgeoisie. . ,

Once out of the hands of the capitalists, education
magically became a new thing. No longer was it a

tool of the exploiter. It had become the boon of the

masses. It enabled them to produce more for them-

selves through technology, the process of production.

No Eggheads Here ’ . a

While the Tsarist regime had designedﬁieducationf

 

for only the few, it gave a great heritage to the
Soviets. It had created, through this select system,
a deep respect for education. This has led to an at-
mosphere which is a nutriant for advanced. study
and scientiﬁc excellence. '

Administration of the system is a difficult prob-
lem. Into the system must go Communist ideology,’
as well as sound education. This can become diffi-
cult. It can bebest seen in the constant re-writing
of history. The schools must also turn out what the
situation demands. ~

When state planning calls for better agriculture,
the policy of the schools must shift to produce
agricultural technologists. If policy changes to em-
brace a strongscience base, educational adminis-
tration must do an aboutface and provide the
Kremlin with,top—notch scientists.

Even though state planning is based on ﬁve-year
plans, ideology with regard to emphasis may change
within this period. When this happens, changes go
into effect down the line.

‘Round and ‘Round

Schools are administered on a local, rather than
national basis, while the ideology is on the national,
rather than local basis.

The word goes down through the party. The basic

responsibility is shiftedfrom ministry to ministry.

Emphasis is shifted. ‘ , _

The local ministry of agriculture is no longer
responsiblesfor educating hordes of tractor drivers.
It is now up to the local ministry of forests and
rivers to provide experts to choose trees for rail-
road ties. And so it goes through the system.

Education begins at the nursery school level, but
even younger than in the U.S. With many of the

mothers working, the children punch the time clo'ck .
with Mom and Dad and head for the nursery..
Result:»Higher production for the state, more food S

for the family and no babysitting bills.

. This is" followed by compulsory seven year ele- .
/ mentary education (which is being extended to ten] 

years). After that it is still “according to his .abi1i.ty ”

     

This eleventh Princetdnian reﬂects what must be

Progressive Policies

Suggested Years Ago While Teaching
What Conant Recently Pushed In “Life”

By JOANNE DOLINAR

A new concept in high scho-01 education which was fea-
tured in a recent issue of Life magazine is actually a rehash
of what one of the University of Pittsburgh’s former profes-
cors said over three decades ago.

In his pamphlet “Selective Education,” written 34 years
ago, Dr. Alexander Silveman advanced the idea of a school

‘(that would allow students to pro-¢

gress according to their ability.
Plans Similar
The article in Life by James
Bryant Conant, former Harvard
_president, and U.S. High Com-
missioner for Germany, presents
a similar plan that can be adapted
to the needs of individual stu-
dents.

According to the Conant-plan,

a school would have three gen-

eral levels of courses. For the

upper 20 per cent there would

be a stiff academic curriculum

which would require 20 hours of
- homework a week.

A course that is largely voca-
tional would be introduced for
the average student but would
also include courses such as

7’'United States History and biology.

The very slow learner in the
lowest 20 per cent of the class
would take very simpliﬁed gen-
eral studies and basic shop
courses. --

Advancement by Performance

Dr. Silverman proposed, in 1924,
that the University students be
grouped according to their ability
in sections of twenty-ﬁve. The
student could be advanced or put
back to another section according
to his performance. Competent
instructors could indicate in which
section the student belonged.

Dr. Silverman explained that
laboratory work in a chemistry
into
eighty experiments and would
constitute a normal year’s work.

One credit could be allowed
for each ten experiments. If a
student completes 60 experiments,
he receives six credits, 70 experi-
ments, seven credits, and so forth.

Althoughlthe basic objective of
both plans is the same, it should
be pointed out that the Conant
plan is for the ideal high school
while the Silverman plan is con-
cerned with colleges and univers-
ities.

Most of the elements in the
Conant plan have been tried in
some high schools. V

Silverman’s idea was tried in
"modified form at.~,the University of
Chicago.

However, no institution has put
his idea into effect exactly the
way that he proposed it.

Silverman feels that if students
have good health and are capable
of going ahead, it is only fair to
let them. How fast a student ad-
vances should be based on ability,
not hisage.

Cites Fallacies

In his pamphlet, Silverman

gave the illustration then, applic-

able to the situation today, that
expecting all students to advance
at an equal rate was as fallacious
as starting several thousand auto-
mobiles of different types from
New York City on a transcontin-
ental race and expecting them all
to arrive in San Francisco at the
same time.

In the same manner, students
of different physical and mental
equipment cannot complete their
schooling in the same amount of
time.

That we expect students to ad-
vance at equal rates in our schools
makes it clear that our education-
al system is at fault, Dr. Silver-

 Mountaineers Here Wed

 

Mitters Seeking Victory
Over Top VeteranTeam

By JIM LACEY
The West Virginia Mountaineers will provide the opposi-
tion next Wednesday when they meet the Panther Mittmen

Pin a game at Wildwood, one of the few times the Blue and

Gold appear at home, at 3:30 p.m.
Coach Steve Harrick will be able to ﬁeld a star-studded,
inﬁeld, all with at least one letter.

Ronnie Retton is the main-stay:

in the inﬁeld and leading hitter
on the «team at .417. Retton also
played on the Mountaineer Bask-
etball team.

Veterans Strong

Two of the others are double
letter winners. Ed Lenart is at
first and Bob Senay will play
third. Senay was the fourth in
Conference batting with a .356
while Lenart banged out .337 in
1955. He was out in 1956 with a
broken leg.

The only other experienced
men are- Bucky Bolyard, a
pitcher, and Wayne Austin, an,
outﬁelder. Bolyard had a. 4-2
record and Austin batted .319.
This makes four regulars who
hit over .300.

Last year the Panthers eked
out a 3-2 win over the Mounties
as Bill Hamilton scattered eight
hits. Only Retton gave the Jungle
Cats trouble as he accounted for
three of them. g

Hoover Shows Form

Corky, C0st’s seventh-inning
double scored Mike Tuchak who
was on base via a single. Tuchak
moved up on Fred DeLosts single
and then scored on Cost’s two-
bagger.

Coach Bob Lewis is pleased
with the progress made by the
hitters. Ron Hoover, captain
and outﬁelder, has especially
caught his eye. “Hoover is nor-
mally a slow starter, in fact last
year he went 0 for 12 and wound
up with a .326 average,” he
stated. “This year Hoover is off
to a good start and should have
a tremendous year barring in-
juries,” continued Lewis. '

Tuchak will be sidelined for
the Mountaineer game because of
a jammed ankle. Herm ‘Joy will

plug the gap‘ at ﬁrst base if West
Virginia pitches a right-hander.
If Coach Harrick hurls a lefty,
then Coach Lewis will counter
“Ala Casey‘Stengel” and shift Pat
Bonacci to ﬁrst‘. Billy Martin or
Joe Zoch will ﬁll in at third.
Hamilton will be trying for his
second win after his victory in

the Cornell game. Other Panther
records are Dick Wirth, 1-0 and
John Rechenbach with a perfect
2-0. John Mirabelli was tagged
with the only Panther defeat.

Tackle Position
Poses Problem

0 O
In Spring Drill

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Recent practice sessions at
Ellsworth Center have found
Panther line coach, Jack Wi-
ley, spending a lot of addi-
tional time .with the tackles.

At present moment the tackle

slot has the least amount of depth
as compared to other positions.

Only three lettermen are back
from the 1957 squad. They are
Bill Lindner of Central Catholic,
Plum high’s Ken Montinari, and

Ernie Westwood from Clairton.'

All three are juniors and tip the
scales around the 200 pound mark.

At the moment Lindner is not
able to practice. He hurt his knee
at a recent scrimmage session and
had to have fluid tapped from it.
“Lindner (should be able to play
in the squad game on May 10,”
stated Assistant Trainer Roger
McGi11. '

Two retiring veterans, but non-
letter winners, at the tackle slot
are Senior Tom Romanik and
Junior Ron Dzadony. Romanik, a
5’-10”, 225 pounder, hails from St.
Vincent while Stowe’s Dzadony is
6’-2”, and tips the scales at 209.

“We have some ﬁne looking
sophomore prospects though, and
I am quite sure that a couple of
these boys will come‘ through
for us at the tackle position this
season,” commented Wiley. -

The lads Wiley has in’ mind are
Dennis Dvorchak of South Union,
Ed Fornadel, from Beaverdale,
Elmer Merkovsky, who hails from
Wilmerding, Beaver’s Dick Mills,
apd Len Vella from Pittston. “All
of these boys developed rapidly
and played a lot of good ball for
me .last fall,” said freshman
coach, Steve Petro.

Petro also tutors the guards
during Spring drills. However, he
doesn’t have to worry much about
depth at thatposition. Back from
past season are Ed Bombich, A1
Corﬁeld, John Guzik, Bob Long-
fellow, Co—captain Ed Michaels,
Norton Seaman, and Henry Suffo-
letta.
