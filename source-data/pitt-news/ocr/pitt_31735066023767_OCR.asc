Awaits Trial In Monica

By the Associated Press

PHlLADELPHIA—A Common
Pleas Court jury has convicted
Sidney Brinkley of rape and first-
degree murder in the death of his
girl friend’s 15-year-old sister.

Brinkley, a construction worker,
was acquitted of robbery by the
jury, which returned its verdict on
Saturday. - ’

The jury reconvenes Monday to
decide if Brinkley, 21, will be
sentenced to death or life imprison-
ment for the August 1979 slaying of
Sheila Hill, of the city’s— Overbrook
Park section.

Gerald Dugan, as assistant
district attorney, said he would seek
the death penalty.

Defense lawyer Arthur James
said the verdict will be appealed.

The jury retired to consider the
verdict shortly before 5 p.m. and
returned less than three hours later.

The defendant showed no emo-
tion when he stood to hear the ver-
dict. The victim’s mother, Inez
Hill, wept. L

“It doesn’t bring Sheila back but

 

it is all we have,” Mrs. Hill said
later of the decision. She added
that she hoped Brinkley would be
sentenced to die.

According to testimony at the
31-day trial, Miss Hill, a high
school student, was returning home
from the movies when she was
beaten, strangled and raped.

Her body was dumped in some
bushes in nearby Delaware County.

The prosecution based its case on
a signed statement police said they
obtained from Brinkley shortly
after his arrest Sept. 10, 1979.

Estelle Hill, the victim’s older
sister and formerly Brinkley’s girl
friend, also testified that Brinkley
admitted the killing to her.

Brinkley already had been con-

. victed of second-degree murder in
' the death of Kathryn Johns, 27, of

Philadelphia. He has also been-
charged in the slayings of Atlantic
Richfield executive Nancy Ross and
University of Pittsburgh student
Monica Jones, and awaits trial in
those cases.

Student Government Board stan-
ding committees are permitted to
nominate ‘candidates for chairman
of their committees under a new
amendment to SGB bylaws recently
approved by the board. ,

Previous SGB bylaws, adopted
last year bythe board, stated that
members of standing committees
would no longer be permitted to

‘ elect their chairman. Instead, stan-

ding committee cha.irmen would be
selected by an ad hoc committee
composed of "three non-returning
members of the particular commit-
tee and three members of the SGB.

Last year’s standing committee
chairmen criticized the bylaws.

“Personally, I feel its an affront
to the individuals on each" one of the
standing committees,” former
allocations chairman Kerry Warren
said last year. “Through such a
selection process, the SGB has in-
dicated their distrust in our ability:
to effectively select a qualiﬁed
leader.” I

Although the board passed the
bylaws last year almost unanimous-
ly, some members expressed second
thoughts about the change in inter-
views this summer. ,

“I didn’t really agree with
them,” board member Bernadette
Herward said. “The bylaws as they
are set down, now, aren’t really
uniform.” v

‘‘I definitely don’t want it as it is
now, where we pick straight out,”_
board member Martin Bertocchi
added. “I would prefer that they

PGR Discusses Outcome of Lobbying Trip to Harrisburg

By VALERIE J ACHIMOWICZ

The Public and Governmental
Relations Committee (PGR) return-
ed last week from a lobbying trip to
Harrisburg, where they talked to
legislators about bills that will in-
fluence funding for Pitt.

PGR discussed the trip and noted
both where it had been successful
and where it had problems at a
meeting last Thursday.

Committe chairman Ellis Cannon

noted that the PGR was “basically
starting all over again.”

“Tuesday’s expedition was an
important first step. There was a
lot of frustration when things didn’t
come about the way that was ex-
pected, but the smallest thing adds
to experience. Experience is what
counts,” he added.

Other members of the committee
who went to Harrisburg also
remarked on the trip.

Lobby co-ordinator Jeanette
Russell said she believed PGR
worked well as a group “and didn’t
get messed up by confusion.”

“Compared with last year we
were better able to readjust and
look for each other for help with
problems,” lobby co-ordinator Pat-
ty Farnan added.

Executive Director Chip Roth
said the committee “showed ver-
satility as a group.”

“We had nice input from
everybody. Going down there
(Harrisburg) will test your gump-
tion and willingness to getinvolved.
You have to listen and be able to
compromise,” Roth said.

Rothalso suggested that the com-
mittee find an official liaison to
provide them with up-to-date infor-
mation.

“Sometimes we were really hur-
ting because we couldn’t- anticipate

problems,” he remarked.

A second topic of discussion was
the voter registration program.
Tom Cohen, who was in charge of
the program, informed the commit-
tee that over 700 students had been
registered to date. The suggestion
was made that the committee in-
form students about getting
absentee ballots. Students needing
an absentee ballot should write to
their home county seat and request
one.

Pitt Nursing Program Prepared for Cunent Nursing Shortage

By FRED BEERS

The United States is in the grip of
a major shortage of hospital nurses,
with some estimates going as high as
30 percent.

The reasons for the shortage are
many, ranging from frustration
over working conditions to the roles

_ they must play in the hospital.

Because of this crisis, the ques-
tion that must be asked is “How
will it affect Pitt’s nursing pro-
gram?”

Enid Goldberg, dean of nursing
here, says there should be “no af-
fect on our school perse,” but she
added that it would depend on the
individual.

“I’ve seen small trends of
graduates going into other areas of
nursing, and this does affect the
numbers,” she said.

In past years, there had been a
reduced enrollment but in the last
two years there has been an increase
with admissions being over the
quota.

This may be due to a new cur-
riculum that has been implemented.

“A decision was made many
years ago to take a good look at the
existing curriculum,” according to
Goldberg. This led to a change

fered, she said.

from a medical model to an in-
tegrated model.

“A nurse needs an excellent
theoretical base. A number of nurs-
ing students just want to be on the
unit, but that is what I call an ap-
prenticeship. Here we provide an
education, we produce a profes-
sional nurse. Other programs,
degree programs, produce what is
called a technical nurse,” Goldberg
explained.

With the nationwide shortage,
the possibility exists that a surge of
less qualified nurses could be hired
out of sheer demand. Goldberg
asserted that she did not feel this
would happen because of the strict
controls placed on professional pro-
grams.

St. Joseph’s College in Maine,
which offers a correspondence-type
course could benefit from the shor-
tage of nurses, according V to
Goldberg.

There could also be benefits for
nurses from here. Goldberg stress-
ed the fact that the shortage is na-
tionwide and that the benefits and
enticements will be greater in other
parts of the country. Because the
crisis isn’t so severe locally, there
are no big enticements being of-

Some hospitals have even offered
vacations to the Tropics after just
one year of service. For the most
part, however, extras are limited to
better working schedules and higher
salaries.

As for the effect the shortage
would have on nurses pursuing
higher degrees, Goldberg said that

.7‘

- T" .x— \

in this area the problem is a lack of
money.

“Most graduate nurses recognize
the need for higherjeducation, but
they are forced to go to school only
part time because of the money
situation.”

Most nurses in graduate school
are part-time and Goldberg predicts

A shertage o rses'.?“.Th_ese_ nursing studets are on t air way to making that -shortageia little less severe. . .

   

that, in the future, all of them will
be part time.

One of the biggest problems en- -

countered in the shortage is the
legislators responsible for hospital
allocations “who believe there is no
shortage.” This is probably due to
the fact that they've been given “er-
roneous information,” Goldberg
added.

You Need Good Lock to Prevent Bicyci. Theft

By KAREN GRZYBICKI

ian

ﬁi

Despite only four reports of bike
thefts for the month of September,
Campus Police are still emphasizing
the importance of proper security
measures when leaving bikes unat-
tended on campus.

“Any place is made safe by a
reliable lock,” according to Lt. Jim
Waters of Pitt’s campus police-.

According to Waters, most
thieves will frequent bike racks with
the largest number of bikes because
the chances of finding a bike with
inadequate lock are greater
there. Most bikes are stolen from
the racks at Hillman Library, the

 

 

Cathedral of Learning and the Stu-
dent Union, according to statistics.
Even though these areas are

heavily trafficked between 9 a.m. .

and 5 p.m. when most thefts occur,
many bystanders do not usually see
the crime taking place.

“It takes approximately ten
seconds for a thief to take a pair of
bolt cutters from a bag, snip the
chain securing the bike and walk
away with it. An observer would
have to witness_the initial act, and it
is done so quickly that most people
don’t catch it,” Waters said.

He added that the individual
perpetrating the crime will wait un-
til there is-decreased traffic in the

area.

The single most effective preven-
tive measure is a good lock, and
Waters recommends the Citadel. It
is a cylindrical key lock ‘/2 to 3/:
inches in diameter made of harden-

,ed steel built into an A-frame.

“The Citadel lock has never been
defeated,” Waters said. “It is vir-
tually impossible to cut through.”

Although the lock costs between
$20 to $25, the investment is well
worth it if it means protecting a
bike that is valued at $100.00 to
$250.00, which is the worth of most

‘stolen bicycles._

While a good lock is effective in
preventing the crime, many pro-
grams are designed to aid in the
recovery of a bike after it is stolen.
Operation I..D. is a program which
takes place in the spring for bike
owners. Officers provide literature
and tips on how to prevent theft.
The operator’s i.d. number is taken

from the bike owner’s drivers_

license, affixed with the prefix
“PA” (for Pennsylvania) and
engraved on the bike by an engraver
provided by the police. This
number is then registered at the
police station and‘ should be
memorized by the owner. If a bike
is stolen, the number can be check-
ed and cross-referenced at the sta-
tion. A . ‘

If a bike is not registered with
Operation I.D., chances of recovery
are _slim, because easily identifiable
characteristics, such-as the color of
the bike, can be changed by the
thief. 0

Approximately $4,500 — $6,000
worth of bikes are ‘stolen in a given

‘year at the University, according to
Waters, with the majority of the
thefts occurring in the months of

A -June, July and August. Most of the The Safest way yet to

thieves apprehended at this time are
juveniles who are out of school for
the summer. While the crime rate
for bikes remains the same, ap-
prehensions by police have increas-
ed.

deterence of these crimes are up,”

Waters said.

“When people invest $100.00 to
$250.00 for a bike, they should be
willing to spend a few more dollars
on a good lock to protect it. That’s
the most important thing,” he em-
phasized.

Resume Writing, Job Interview Hints Offered at Seminar

Students interested in informa-
tion about a possible major or
career, or individuals already in the
job market who are contemplating
a career change, will have the
opportunity to have many of their
questions answered this week at the
Career Seminar Series.

Sponsored by Pitt’s Counseling
and Student Development Center,
the series attempts to provide
students with an overview of a
variety of ﬁelds which require col-
lege degrees for entry.

Beginning today and continuing
through Thursday, the seminars
providestudents the opportunity to

did it themselves or that they submit
three names and we pick.”

SGB president Bill Abraham in-
dicated earlier that he wanted to see
the process of appointing chair-
men go through one cycle.

“I know there are still com-
plaints, mainly from standing C.C."I-
mittee people,” Abraham said this
summer, “but I would like to see
everybody let it go through one
wave of committee people‘ going
through the appointed system, and
if it doesn’t work, I won’t mind see-
ing it go back to the old way.”

Bertocchi commented on the new
amendment.

“I think it’s the first step in giv-
ing the committees back their con-

trol by allowing them to pick their

chairman,” Bertocchi said.

The board also approved an elec-
tions committee request that outgo-
ing SGB members be permitted to
draft questions that incumbent can-
didates would then address in their
platforms.

Under consideration by the board
is a Resident Student Association
funding request.

The RSA and Pitt’s Housing
Office had previously shared ex-
penses for publishing the Collide-A-

Scope handbook, which is
distributed to all resident students
each year.

The board is currently reviewing

I this request.

attend a series of workshops and
talk informally with more than 300
professionals from their respective
fields.

IBM and National Steel will be
represented at the seminar, along
with representation "from small in-
dependent businesses, social service
agencies and graduate schools.

Included in the program are
workshops designed to offer
valuable hints such as how to write
a resume, practical advice on job in-
terview techniques, and suggestions
and predictions on the job outlook
for liberal arts majors.

Literature combined with the
assistance of persons presently
employed in their respective careers
will be present to offer any addi-
tional information requested by the
student.

One of the problems students
have in deciding upon a career is a
lack of information, according to
Marti Moore, Pitt’s career counsel-
ing coordinator.

“It’s very hard to make a career
decision without the proper infor-
mation. The Career Seminar Series
pools together a great deal of infor-
mation in one place,” Moore said.

The agenda for the afternoon
open conferences is:

—Monday, October 6, medical
and health related professions;

—Tuesday, October 7,
employer’s fair for liberal arts can-
didates; :

—-Wednesday, October 8,
business, industry and communica-
tions careers;

—Thursday, October 9, govern-
ment, social work, education
careers and law schools and law
professionals. .

In addition, the Career Seminar
Series will feature a “Career
Seminar Highlights” open con-

ference this year, to be held from 4
to 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 to 8 p.m. on
Thursday.

The open conferences will be held
in the Student Union Ballroom
from 12 to 3:30 p.m. The resume
and job writing workshops will be

Rowdy behaivor and numerous complaints from spectators at V  2  ,«

Pitt football games have prompted the Pitt stadium authority to _ ' A ,2 s “W =‘.
revamp its alcohol policy, forbidding spectators to bring alcoholic A . '
beverages onto stadium grounds. .

The former policy which also forbid the transport of alcohol in
the stadium was seldom enforced. . '-

The revised policy gives gatekeepers the charge of searching spec-
tators’ packages at the entrances and, if necessary, refusing admis-
sion to anyone possessing such beverages-." ‘ ‘ '

Under federal law, football fans can refuse to submit to the in-
spection of their packages, but such refusals will prompt the gate
attendant to deny admission to the game.

Packages containing alcohol that do manage to slip by the wat-
chful eyes of the gatekeepers will be confiscated upon sight by Pitt-
sburgh police and Pinkerton security guards who patrol the
stadium during allhome games. _

Students were, no doubt, upset with enforcement of the new
policy at Saturday’s game against Maryland.

The sharing of wine and beer by fans has become as much a part
of brisk, fall football afternoons at Pitt stadium as the Panther
mascot’s on-field antics and -the mad ravings of stadium announcer
Roger Huston.

‘Students have long looked forward to Saturday afternoon foot-
ball as a release form the day to day pressures of schoolwork and ’
jobs. Students look to Saturdays as ansoccasion where the entire
student body joins together for the common purpose of cheering
the home team onto victory and, hopefully, a national champion-

' ship. It is seldom that the entire student body can agree on any one
issue but in the case of the Panthers, there is never any doubt in the
minds of students which team is number 'one._

But as is the case with anything, there are those who have tried to
spoil these good times. ' L ‘ .-

There are a few fans who must _drink in excess, become obnox-
iously intoxicated and ruin everyone’s good time by throwing ob- _
jects, e.g. liquor bottles, beer cans, and various other projectiles at
the football players and band members. ._

We are thankful that one of our fellow students or other
unknowing sideline spectator has not been seriously injured as a
result of the reckless action of these individuals.

We also hope that outsiders do not think these individuals repre-
sent the “true Pitt Panther fan”—the fans who have followed the
Panthers through the lean years when victories were few and far
between, right up to the present when Pitt’s is one of the premier
college football teams. ”

Perhaps the stadiumauthority has never been too kind in enforc-
ing the alcohol policy with its threat of mere confiscation of .
alcoholic beverages as punishment. - V ' /

Now that the new policy has been well-publicized and all students
are aware of its existence, more serious consequences are in order
to ensure that no one is injured.

One alternative might be to impose fines on anyone (whether
they be non-student orstudents) found in possession of alcoholic
beverages or throwing objects at the sideline crowd. For students, _
being fully aware of the enforcement policies, some type of
disciplinary probation or suspension from school might -be in

order.

Such punishments could be considered along the same lines as
those imposed on students hosting post-game parties in the
residence halls. For most students who go to the game for an after-
noon of football enjoyment, such punishments would be no im-
position, as those whose only source of Saturday afternoon fun
seems to come through their attempts to injure other persons would

be dealt their iustice. -

- Our recommendation may sound harsh or just a little too severe.

We would much rather speak our piece now before any damage has
been done, than after one of our fellow students has been needless- .

ly injured.

That is the kind of news we can easily do without.

 ,  . _. _ . , ,Nt(;nr.r,y Surexvrsoxs _ s _ -

By NICK ARNETT

John Anderson’s running mate,
Pat Lucey, is scheduled to address
the university today. I ’d like to sug-

- gest an address. How about:

General Delivery _

Santa Clara, California 95050 _

If he’d do that, I'd be happyto
wear an “I Love Lucey” button, or
whatever campaign gimmick
they've come up with.

Knapsacks -are becoming the
norm around here. I’ve succumbed
to the trend and tote my books,
tape recorder, and other gear in a
forest-green Alpenlite pack. I feel
sort of silly with forest green—that
makes it harder to spot in the
woods. I wonder how_many of the
‘day-packs’ around the campus
have actually spent a day out in the
woods? I’ve noticed that most peo-

ple who use them could get along -

with only one strap. They obvious-
ly aren’t ' used to having much
weight in them.’ Well, _they’re better
than briefcases.

Bob Fryer’s racing machine sat
on the grass for a week in front of
one of those annoying signs: “This
shortcut only saves a few steps.
Isn’t your environment worth more
than that?" I’d rather see a path
worn into the dirt than have an ug-
ly, noisy piece of machinery killing
thegrass. Bob Fryer himself hand-
ed me one of his flyers, saying,

3‘?9“°-.3-rl-‘£9159.-I-»l‘!*9¥i 2.‘.5‘}31.=‘~’-.-°!=‘4¥‘3‘!a=-r- ‘«—*‘-‘£-‘§~?*s‘»‘3:‘-¥T-«.'25%l'-

service for a half a year and he
didn’t even recognize me. It’s just
as well.

Folks in the Outdoors Club tell
me the Cathedral of Learning has
manyfine climbing routes, but the
campus police tend to discourage
climbers. Why don’t they
discourage the ROTC from rappell—
ing out of its windows?. Perhaps
we'll see the first ascent of the north
face sometime this coming year.

I've discovered a way to keep the
university’s computers from shut-
ting me off after an hour. You see,
if the area in which you’re working
is busy, you only get an hour. After
55 minutes, the machine sternly
warns you that you have five
minutes to get lost." If you don't, it
disconnects you. Well folks, there’s
a very easy way to defeat the
systems, but I’ve already given as‘
many clues as I'm going to.

I have a friend in a terrible jam.
He wants to be able to do whatever
he feels like doing-—that is, he
doesn't deny himself things he'll
later feel guilty about. As Isee it,
he's got two choices. Choice
number one: get rid of his cons-
cience. If he didn’t have a sense of
what's right or wrong, he wouldn’t
have to feel guilty. If he didn’t feel
guilty, he’d be happy. Choice
number two: learn to deny himself

There are an incredible number '

of jammed parking meters around
Oakland. It seems like the city
would do something about the pro-
blem. Perhaps if they spend a cou-
ple of million dollars, they might be
able to discover how foreign objects
become lodged in the meters. For a
couple million more, they might
figure out why ring tabs and other
odd bits of metal are inserted. And
then, just maybe, City Council
would do something to make park-
ing reasonable here.

Sometime you might . want to
watch people trying to cross the
street between the Student Union
and the Cathedral.- At the top of
the hour, when classes are chang-
ing, there’s a steady flow. Cars
come up and find that they can’t
sneak through. Some drivers wait
patiently until there’s an opening,
then go through. Other drivers, in
more of a hurry, slowly creep into
the crowd of students, until one
person on each side stops and lets
the car pass. It’s interesting to try
to predict who will give in to the
cars.

The sandwiches inthe Student’
Union rec room have certainly been
improved. There’s turkey and roast
beef now, and they certainly are
better than the past assortment of
lunch meats and cheeses. The milk
is never sour, either. ,1

Panthers Devastate Maryland,

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Editor
vAnother team bit the dust Satur-
day at Pitt Stadium as the Pitt Pan-
ther football team mauled the
Maryland Terrapins, 38-9.
Quarterback Dan Marino led the
Panthers to three first-half
touchdowns in a game which wasn’t
even as close as the score indicates.
With disco music blasting in the
background, coach Jackie Sherrill
gave his impressions-of the game
following Saturday’s contest.
“We’re still working our way up
and this game helped point us in the
right direction,” he said. “We’re
still getting over a lot of injuries on
the offensive line, but we proved to-
day we could beat a good team‘
despite those injury distractions.”
The offense exploded for 383
total yards while the . Panther
defense held the Terps to only 22
yards rushing, Maryland’s stong

_ point.

“Defensively, we wanted to con-
trol the linefof scrimmage and force
them to throw and we did just that
most of the time,” said Sherrill.
“We held (Charlie) Wysocki pretty
much intact and that was another
key part of our defensive effort.”

Wysocki is Maryland’s leading

' rusher and until last week’s game

against North Carolina, he had
been gaining upward of 150 yards
per game. He was held to just 14
yards against Carolina and just 38
against Pitt.

Marino was 16 for 34 and was in-

tercepted one time. He passed for
282 yards and three touchdowns,

~ two of which came before the first

half whistle blew."

Marino’s longest throw was a
51-yarder to Dwight Collins who
had an exceptional day at flanker,
catching two passes for 86 yards
and two" touchdowns. That pass
was also Pitt’s first score, which

Fullback Randy McMillan looks for a hole in the Marylan

came with less than nine minutes
gone in the game.

“On the first-pass, we called a
play that was supposed to work if
they had single coverage on me,”
said Collins. “They did and I simp-
ly outraced the defender. Danny
layed it up there perfectly.” .

After Dave Trout kicked the ex-

Htra point,- the Panthers .led 7-O.

Trout had another outstanding day,
kicking five extra points and a
40-yard field goal, as well as

booting five unreturnable kickoffs.

On the ensuing. series, Terpt

quarterback Mike Tice threw a pass
which was intercepted by Sal

Sunseri at the Maryland 26-yard

line. Seven plays later, Marino
threw a 17-yardscoring strike to.
Willie Collier. With Trout’s extra
point, the Panthers were up 14-0,

and that’s how the first quarter end-_

ed.
The Panthers took possession of
the ball at its own 30 after a Dale

Castro punt. Marino went to work
immediately, ﬂipping a short pass
over the middle to Benjie Pryor,
who took the ball 22 yards and
gained a first down. _

Four plays later, Marino threw
complete to Collier who caught the
ball at the’ Maryland 23 for a first
down. With the ball at_ the two
following a pass interference call,
Randy McMillan took the ball over
left guard- for a touchdown.
Trout’s kick made it 21-0.

Six minutes later, Maryland got
on the board with a 38-yard Dale

with the score 21-3 in Pitt’s favor.

first possession of the second half.

‘ The controversial side of football
was evident in Maryland’s final

Pantherette Spikers Dominate Tournament

By SCOT STONE

The Pantherette volleyball team
lost in the final round to Penn State
but managed to dominate the tour-
nament, winning four matches to
one. The scores in the final round
were 8-15, 15-7, and 8-15.

“Penn State played really well,”
Shelton Collier, the Pitt coach said.
“It was hard for us, psychological-
ly, to dominate a tournament all
day long. At that point we were
four and zero, we hadn’t been
challenged, and we went into the
finals, maybe not over-conﬁdent,
but not as mentally prepared as we
needed to be.”

Penn State has been characteriz-
ed by Collier as a team with “one
very good player,” Ellen Krandall.
Paired with Linda Stadler of the
Pantherettes, Krandall was held in
check but others on the Penn State
team made up the difference.

“We played head and shoulders
over the other three teams,” Collier
said. V “One of our most impressive
wins was over Rutgers who, just the
week before, had nearly beaten us
at Temple.”

Pitt also beat Georgetown, a
second-ranked team at the beginn-
ing of the season, who has not
presented much of a challenge.

“Pd have to say, right now,

Georgetown is ranked number four
in the East,” Collier said, “but they
still give everyone problems.
Georgetown is ranked number in
the East,” Collier said, “but they
still give everyone problems.
They’ve beaten Penn State and
Rutgers
the season.”

Two key Pantherette players were
injured this weekend. Stadler rein-
jured her Achil1e’s heel, and Ellen
Mangus injured her back.

Among the many contributions
made over the weekend, according
to Collier, were the outstanding
performances of Paula Olsen. .

“All day long she had an ex-

occasionally throughout

cellent tournament,” Collier said.
“She was one of our top servers and
spikers.”

Also noted were the spiking skills
of Linda Stadler and Peggy McCar-
thy.

Once again the quality of the
bench was an important ingredient
in the level of play.

“A lot of our substitutes can beat
these other teams, and that’s a
credit to the depth of our bench.”

Over the season, the Pantherettes

have been tuning. up their team"

play, getting ready for the more im-
portant and demanding matches
closer to the nationals.

“We are maturing as a team,”
Collier said. “When we started this
year, we had some freshmen and
transfers, some substitutes, and
starters from last year’s team, so
there has been a lot of growth
necessary as a unit.

“Right now,” he added. “I’m
seeing a lot of that growth as 12
people are coming together as one
unit with a common goal.”

Last year the Pantherettes were
ranked 13th nationally and are hop-
ing to gain serious recognition as a
national contender this year. Next
week they are going to the Houston
National Tournament.

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

When the Panther soccer team
takes the field, it will look toward

the services of fullback Jim Hack-
worth to help secure wins. The big
fullback from nearby North Hills

‘ has developed into a top-rate, very

determined defender for the Pan-
ther booters.

Although Hackworth is in his se-
cond season as a Panther he has
been affiliated with the team for
nearly three years. Hackworth was
recruited for the fall season of 1977
with a crop of incoming freshmen
who were thought to be able to
change the mediocre outcome of
the year before. But unfortunately
,fQr-,t_h\e-, Panthers, personal reasons

“I really wanted to play soccer
when I first came here to Pitt,” said
Hackworth, “but personal reasons

drove me away from the team. Plus —

I wasn’t playing very much so I just
decided to quit. I took a whole year
off from soccer and started gaining
a lot of weight.”

He finally decided that he had
stayed away from the sport he loved
to play for too long. He began to
lift weights to distribute what he
had gained in body weight. His
next step was to begin playing in the
Keystone League. This league is
made up of young and old players
alike, amateurs who just haven’t
been able to make it in the pros and
an occasional ex-pro. The league
played an important part in getting

‘Hackworth back in shape and

creating second. thoughts in his
mind about playing collegiate ball
again.

“After that year off, I began to
play in the Keystone League for the
Pittsburgh Soccer Club. I played
the whole year and enjoyed it," said
Hackworth. "I just didn’t have it
in me to start playing for Pitt again.
Plus I knew that I had lost a lot
from the year layoff.”

A year ago, Hackworth began to
look back into the possibility of
playing collegiate ball for his junior
year.

“I thought a lot about coming
back,” said Hackworth,” and I
talked to some people about the
idea. I thought that I was good
enough to may t‘or*‘1.°i\lt.and there-
fore decided to give it another try.”

That second try by Hackworth
was one of the best things that has
happened to Panther soccer in re-
cent years. Hackworth had to make
a big move back to the fullback
position and defensive play, from
the front line or midfield position
he used to play.

“The switch was tough to adjust
to because I like to make runs up
field to the goal,” said Hackworth.
“I like breakaways and trying to
score.”

Hackworth entered into a defen-
sive unit that was already rather
solid. His tough, hard nosed type
of play added to the Panther back
four. Two of those fullbacks, Tim
Liebenguth and Jerry Tomasetti,
are ‘now ‘gone’ from the _l?anthe_r

lineup._ The other; To_m‘l('ui1ke‘l”,‘i’s

back for his senior year with Pitt.

‘‘It took me a couple of games to .

get used to being a defender,” said
Hackworth. “I look to Tom
Liebenguth as being someone that
has taught me well. He taught me
how to be an aggressive defender
and how to be mean when you have
to. What we lost last year with Tom
and Jerry, we gained in skill with
Don Bowen and Tom Trempus.”
Kunkel, his fellow defender,
believes that Hackworth’s great
desire is what has led him to the
scrappy type of play that he exhibits
in each and every Pitt outing.
“Hack is the most aggressive
player on the field,” said Kunkel.

Pitt’s Willie Collier had a fabulous day receiving against Maryland. The Pan-

ther flanker caught seven passes for 121 yards and one touchdown.

Willie Collier stood by his locker
smiling. He had plenty to smile
about. Collier had just finished his
finest performance’ ever at Pitt.
Collier showed no respect to the
previously nationally ranked defen-
sive unit of the Terrapins, as he rid-
dled theirsecondary with seven cat-
ches for 121 yards.

Collier’s performance shows that
the Panthers, along with Dwight
Collins and Julius Dawkins, have a
fine set of receivers who appear to
be improving with each game.

The seven catches were more than
his previous three game total of
six. Collier explained the offensive
philosophy at Pitt.

“When you have as good a
quarterback as Dan Marino, you
have to take advantage of him.
With our receivers, we feel we can
throw the ball with anybody.”

It was not the seven catches that
caught the eye of the spectator but
the ability of Collier to run with the
ball after it has been safely craddled
in his hands.

“I like to run with the ball after I
catch and until today I haven’t had
a chance to show that.”

Expected to contribute heavily to
Pitt’s aerial show, Collier got off to
a slow start. According to him this
was due to nervousness.

“I was really intense those first
three games and I was really press-
ing but I decided today to just go
out and play.”

'It’s a good thing he did. Collier
made several spectacular catches

and runs. His best play of the game
occurred early in the third quarter.

Marino hit Collier with a short pass
at the 40-yard line of Maryland.

From there Collier displayed the
open field running that had ‘not
been evident in the first three
games. At the 40, he spun around
to elude a tackler and started to run
back to the 45 to escape a hord of
tacklers. Collier then crossed the
field and ran laterally before mak-
ing a sharp cut upfield. When it

was all over Collier was downed at I

the 29 yard line in the arms of
several Terrapins who had begun

the chase twenty yards earlier.

As Collier explained, there was a
distinct reason for his success.

“They were playing man to man
and we felt we could beat them.
Dwight and I knew they couldn’t
guard us that way and we just got
open.” '

As far as Willie Collier is con.-
cerned the running game will start
to come around any game now.

“Once we start playing those real
important games like Florida State
‘next week and Tennessee, the run
will be there,” he said. “But right
now the passis working and we’re
gonna stick with it.”

Willie Collier showed why the
Pitt Panthers are, with each game,

starting to look like a team of _

destiny. The offense, after some
early trouble, seems to be jelling at
the right time. Collier has had a big
hand in that and if performances
like Saturday continue, ‘the Pan-'
thers are going to be tough to beat.

ten. His desire is just great.”

Panther freshman Phil D’Amato
remembers Hackworth from their
high school playing days together
back in North Hills. During that
time Hackworth was named as an
all-star in Western Pennsylvania
and MVP of his high school team.

“He’s definitely the best player
that ever came out of North Hills,”
said D’Amato. “He goes and puts
his mind into games. He’s a first
rate player.”

Pitt Ove

(Continued from page 10)

threw into the left corner of the end
zone for Chris Havener. Havener
and Panther safety Rick Trocano
went up for the ball. As Havener
caught the ball, Trocano knocked
the ball out of his hand before he
hit the ground. The play was ruled a
touchdown and the Terps were on
the board again.

Maryland missed its try at a two-
point conversion and the score
stood at 24-9.

In the fourth quarter, the Pan-
thers mounted another substantial
drive. ‘Starting at their own 36, the
Panthers moved to the Maryland 35
after a few short runs and a 16-yard
Marino pass to Collier. On the next
play, Marino hit Collins for his se-
cond touchdown catch of the day,
a 35 yarder. ‘

.“The defender was step-for-step
with me,” said Collins, “but he
picked up the ball a little late and I
was able to out-jump him for it. It
was another perfect pass.”

On the ensuing kickoff, Jan
Carinci took the ball out of the end-
zone and tried an unsuccessful for-
ward pass from the Maryland two.
Pitt’s Pat McQuaide jumped on the
ball in the endzone for a Pitt
touchdown. That score closed out
the scoring for the afternoon with
nine minutes left to play.

Maryland coach Jerry Claiborne _

was unhappy with his team’s total
performance.
. .‘.‘They just whipped us.” he said.

_“‘I den't;:hingﬁ§.,q1:;ye;q.g§'wen as ,

Hackworth feels more comfor-
table working with the Panthers of

1980 than he did a year ago. He at- -

tributes much of this to the Panther
attackers. Pitt has already scored
four more goals this season in six
games than they did in the entire
season of 1979.

“The offense makes" me much
more confortable than a year ago,”
said Hackworth. “Aggressive for-
wards like Bob (Hughes) and Eric
(Tiedtke) make an offense a big

elms Ten-apins Vlﬁth Big

we could have. I know our pass
defense didn’t.”

“It wasn’t that they were doing
anything different offensively,”
Claiborne added. “They did essen-
tially the same things they have
been doing. We didn’t do a good

job of hitting their receivers off the

line of scrimmage.” ‘
Claiborne was very impressed
with Panther Ricky Jackson.
“Jackson is not that far behind
Hugh Green,” he said. “We knew
that all along. They are two
outstanding players.” Sherrill again
lauded the efforts of Hugh Green.
“Hugh Green had another just
amazing, amazing game,” said
Sherrill. “I haven’t seen a better
defensive player in my lifetime.”
PITT NOTES: Pitt punter Dave
Heppler had another good game,
punting seven times for an average
of 41.4 yards. . .Pitt had a below-
par day in the rushing department.
The Panthers attempted only 28
running plays and gained just 95
yards. . .The Pitt defense held

Maryland at the goal line keeping _

the Terps out of the endzone with
less than a minute to play. . .Pitt
should move up from sixth in the
rankings as third-ranked Nebraska
lost to Pitt’s next opponent, Florida
State, 18-14 and second-ranked
Ohio State fell to UCLA, 1741.

themselves to be recognized on the
field. The entire season is different
than it was last” year,” adds
Hackworth. ,“We’ve seen a lot of
-scoring from our front line. All the
forwards are doing well. Plus,
there is a much better attitude on
the team. We want to win and
think we can win. And, more im-
portantly, we know that we can

‘For that they areithankful.

even tougher as the game goes on.”

He’s tremendous. His greatest
assets are his speed and his
strength,” -said midfielder Chris
Richmond.

“He is definitely the iron man on
the team,” added Tiedtke.

Hackworth also has an excep-
tional quality that the rest of his
teammates just love to imitate. His
laugh, a very unique one, brings a
good many other laughs from his
much smaller counterparts.

Passing or running? Which is the most effective
way to win a college football game? In the past, the
answer was clear that a team possessing a powerful

‘ ground attack, with only occasional passing, would

be dominant. It still is true today although an in-

creasingly high number of teams across the nation

are finding that a passing game may be the future
power.

A look over the past decade (1970-1979) at NCAA
statistics shows the tremendous trend toward the run. '
For instance, the top four teams in winning percen-
tage over this period also happen to be the top four
teams in rushing offense during the same period.
Michigan leads the way in winning percentage for the
’70’s with a mark of .894 (96-l0-3) and are number
four in rushing offense. Alabama is second in
percentage .891 (98-12) and second in rushing of--
fense. Oklahoma is third in winning percentage .882
(96-12-2) and number one in rushing. Ohio State is
fourth in winning percentage .862 (89-13-3) and third
in rushing offense.

That is a totally revealing statistic. The top four
rushing teams have won the highest percentage of
their games. The only exception to the rule is Penn
State who is fifth in winning percentage (.835, 91-18)

    

By Mike Dichiara

and only 19th in rushing. The second five in winning
percentage is equally compelling becausethey include
No. 6 Nebraska (.830), No. 7 Texas (.807), No. 8
Notre Dame (.802), No. 9 Southern California (.797)
and No. 10 Arizona State (.757). Those teams were

respectively eighth, fifth, twelfth, tenth and eleventh
in rushing offense. Thus, of the ten best teams in
winning percentage, seven were also in the top ten for
rushing offense.

Now, let’s look at those rushing stats more closely.
Michigan averaged 293.9 yards rushing per game
over the ten-year period. Alabama averaged 298.7
yards and Oklahoma averaged a phenominal 364.2
yards rushing offense (and the Sooners also averaged
5.51 yards per rushing play over ten years). The rest
of the group have averaged at least 245 yards per
game or more while rushing. . .

Want more? Of this elite group, only Nebraska
(15th) and Notre Dame (19th) have ranked in the top
twenty passing offenses of the decade. That shows
just how dominating a rushing oriented team can be.

Sidelines

Despite the overwhelming evidence for the rushing
game, more and more coaches are beginning to
changetheir minds.

LaVell Edwards, coach of Brigham Young said,
“During the 1970’s the focus was on option football,
but in the l980’s more and more teams will pass.” He
cites that better quality players coming out of high
school are an important factor to the change.

Pitt is a prime example of this. Over the last cou-
ple of years, such high caliber recruits as Dan Marino
and Dwight Collins have transferred the Panthers in-
to a passing oriented team, no matter what coach
Jackie Sherrill may say. When Pitt won the national
title in 1976, the Panthers were run oriented because
of superback Tony Dorsett. This year, Pitt's success
will be determined through the air.

Florida State is another example. Last season,
while going through the regular season undefeated,
the Seminoles would average between 40 and 50
passes a game. They would literally bomb the op-
position into submission". However, when State ran
into Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, the Sooners ran
the Seminoles out of the stadium. - .

Although there are indeed more passing oriented
teams today and that many experts think that the
‘80’s will be a passing decade.

Steelers Hold On to Beat Vikings

nesota slipped to 2-3.
Bradshaw connected with

time list with Leroy Kelly of the
Cleveland Browns.

—Terry Bradshaw passed for
one touchdown and ran for
another and Pittsburgh in-
tercepted five passes yesterday
as the Pittsburgh Steelers held
off Minnesota, 23-17, in the Na-
tional Football League.

Mike Wagner, Donnie Shell,
Jack Ham each picked off
passes as the Steelers rolled to a
23-3 lead before Minnesota bat-
tled back with two fourth
quarter touchdowns.

The victory left Pittsburgh
with a 4-1 _record while Min-\

Calvin Sweeney on a 21-yard
scoring pass midway through

the first quarter, but Matt"

Bahr’s conversion attempt fail-

Bradshaw also ran 2 yards for
a touchdown late in the third
quarter, when the Steelers seem-

ed to have complete. control of

the game.

Earlier, Franco Harris had
scored on a 4-yard touchdown
.run. It was the 74th career
touchdown for Harris, tying
him for third on the NFL’s all-

Pittsburgh held Minnesota

quarterback Tommy Kramer in

check until the fourth quarter,
when he fired a 21-yard
touchdown pass to Sammy
White. Kramer then scored on a
4-yard quarterback draw to nar-
row the gap to 6 points with 11
minutes left in the game.

The Vikings intercepted a
Bradshaw pass midway through
the fourth quarter, but moments

, later, Kramer suffered. his

fourth interception when Jack

’ Lambert picked off a pass -
