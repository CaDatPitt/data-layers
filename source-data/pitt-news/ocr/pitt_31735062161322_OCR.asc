Four Lose Deferments
Because of Low Grades

Four University students so far
have had their draft postpone-
ments cancelled because they fail-
ed to maintain satisfactory aca-
demic standing.

Under the present draft rules,
the offices of the Bus Ad school
and the College, the schools in
which the students were enrolled,
were required to notify their draft
boards that postponement of in-
duction for the men was no longer

authorized.

iGovernor Promises To Stand

B y Schools During Crisis

_. Governor John S. Fine has promised that Pennsylvania
‘Will do its best to help its colleges and universities over the
‘war crisis with ﬁnancial assistance.

‘ Speaking at a recent dinner ate

Dickinson Law School, of which
he is an alumnus, the Governor

I said; demands for war manpower

_“may presently ruin our system
of higher education” unless “alert-
ness and courage are exercised

-to prevent such a result. He also

warns colleges to “go slow” in re-

‘ducing their teaching facilities.

Queried by The Pitt News, Wil-
{liam S. Tacey, assistant professor

,Sti1lman J. Patterson has been

 appointed student colonel of the
1 ROTC at Pitt. He is a regimental

commander.

, Other high ranking appoint-
ments included lieutenant—colonels
Donald F. Baret, Chester S. Carr,
and James K. Lamp. New majors
are Earl P. Jacob, James J. John-
ston, Harry E. Roth, and Robert

A 5'. Stringert.

Four captains have also been

Iappointed.

\

 

of speech and secretary of the Pitt
chapter of the Association of
American University Professors,
agreed with Gov. Fine.

Mr. Tacey said Pitt’s allowance
from the state is “relatively low”
but if the state would increase its
aid to schools in proportion to
some of the state-supported col-
leges, then the program would
gain support during these critical
days. ,

In comparing the situation to
Civil War days, Duff praised the
efforts in behalf of education that
were carried out by Andrew J.
Curtin, then governor of Penn-
sylvania. ‘

In addition, the governor said
that nothing must be permitted to
dim the light of education al-
though the prospects for Amer-
ican youth in the immediate fu-
ture are not bright. There never
has been any period in history
when burdens and responsibilities
have rested so heavily as they do
today on the coming generation,

Econ Lecturer’s
Festival Beard
40 Years Old

Dr. Josef Macek, lecturer in
economics, certainly would win
the Spring Festival’s beard
growing contest if he were eli-
gible to enter.

Of course, Dr. Macek has had
a head start on Pitt men-—he’s
been sporting his full grown
spade-style beard for 40 years.

He started to grow his beard
when he was studying in Berlin
in 1911.

His wife was indifferent at
ﬁrst, but later got used to Dr.
Macek’s whiskers. In fact she
got so used to it that when he
shaved off his growth after ten
years of married life she threat-
ened to divorce him unless he
grew it back.

He went on to say that he is
sure that the women at Pitt will
get used to Pitt men’s beards just
as his wife got used to his.

Authority to OK SC Petition

By JOHN KULAMER

The Commons Room dance issue was still up in the air

today.

The University social committee, at a special meeting on .

Wednesday ruled that it had no authority to OK a Congress’

‘Suspect’ In
Second Night

The Pitt Players will go before‘
the Foster Memorial footlights to-
night at 8:30 for the second show-
ing of their psychological thriller,‘
“Suspect.”

The drama opened last night

‘with ﬁrst-nighter festivities, in-

cluding a reception in the base-
ment of the Memorial.

There are a limited number of
seats left for performances tonight
and tomorrow. Tickets are $1
apiece but must be reserved be-
fore show time.

Mel Silver and Ruth Schwartz
hold down the lead roles.

Built around a suspected double
axe murder, “Suspect” requires a
cast of only eight persons. The
eight are entangled in a psycho-
logical net from which they must
sort out the guilt or innocence of
a woman suspected of chopping
up her father and step-mother.
Over 200 High School
Students Convene Here

The physics department will
sponsor its second free “physics
clinic” for district high school stu-
dents tonight and tomorrow.

“Sound and Music” will be the
topic of lecture—demonstrations in
G-8 Cl. at 8 p. m. tonight and
10:30 a.—m. tomorrow. Over 240
students attended the first “clinic”
held in January. ~

Dr. Oswald Blackwood, who
will give the lecture, says it will
help overloaded high school phys-
ics teachers, handicapped by lack
of demonstration equipment, and

introduce "district students to Pitt.

‘dance.

The committee met to con-
sider a petition, presented by
SC President Bill McKinley,
asking that the Commons
Room be made available for
a senior dance on June .8.
The petition said in part that
such a dance would have
strong sentimental value, was
“deﬁnitely feasible”, and
would promote school spirit.

Dean of Men T. W. Biddle, in a
statement after the meeting, said
the committee decided that it
“could not make the Commons
Room available.” It could, he
said, only make a recommenda-
tion to the proper administrative
authorities.

Motion Asks Two Dances

He said further that a motion
was introduced that the committee
recommend that the Commons
Room be approved for two sig-
niﬁcant formal dances each year,
a Christmas and a graduation
dance. The ﬁrst one would be
held this spring.

After some oiscussion the pro-
posal was referred to a subcom-
mittee which was instructed to
develop a motion which the whole
committee could approve.

Another Meeting Soon

The clean said that anothei
special meeting of the social com-
mittee would be called for Mon-
day or Tuesday to" consider the
motion.

When asked to whom the
recommendation would be di-
rected, Dean Biddle replied,
“probably to the Board of
Deans.”

It was not known whether Con-
gress had any plans for taking its
petition to any other authority.

McKinley hat no comments tc
make when he came out of the
meeting.

Loyalty
Oath Use
Spreading

In the wake of the Korean

’\

A War, a wave of required “oath

signing” is slowly but surely
spreading throughout our col-
leges and univer‘sities.

The best known example of
this occurred at the Univer-
sity of California where the fac-
ulty was threatened with loss of
tenure and dismissal if they failed
to sign a loyalty oath. Much of
thefaculty did refuse. X

As a -result of this, the admin-
istration, the faculty and the stu-
dents all lost heavily. Numerous
courses were dropped; certain na-
tional ﬁgures, including some

heads of their departments were

reelased; and the trustees were

A lambasted with criticism by educa-

try.

In California an involved legal
tangle ‘regarding academic tenure
is being bitterly fought in the
courts. A group of professors are

{arguing the administration cannot

ﬁre them for any other reason
other than professional incompe-
tency; the trustees have replied
that the oath signing is a require-
ment for employment and that
the professors have notmet it.

In the Lone Star state, legisla-
tion is pending which would re-
quire not nonly _all communists in
the state to register, but for col-
lege students and faculty to de-
clare their loyalty in oath form.

Strong objections to this con-
cept of enforced loyalty oaths

A have come from various groups on

the premise they endanger civil
liberties and help the communists
by placing them on common
ground with the “embattled lib-
erals.” Others maintain they are
necessary to protect the colleges
from what they consider the
“communist menace.”

Alma Mater Allulthor

By GEORGE BARBOUR

From his 9th‘ ﬂoor office in the
City-County Building, grey-haired.
bespectacled George M. P. Baird
has a panoramic city-view. And
many times, as he has scanned the
city, he has focussed on a distant
Sight, his cherished institution——
the University of Pittsburgh.

It’s his alma mater. It is also
an institution which will always
remember George M. P. Baird of
the Class of ’09. The main reason
is his composition of the lyrics to
the University's Alma Mater. Dur-
ing his undergraduate years from
1905 to 1909, the University lack-
ed spirit, he says. There was only
one yell, the old Alleghenee. No
band played for games, and nei-
ther were there any school songs.

Wrote Song in 1909

As a graduate student in 1909,
Mr. Baird helped alleviate one
shortcoming when he composed
the lyrics for the future ofﬁcial
song. It was first sung at an alumni
banquet in 1910. The song, set to
a Haydn score, gained in popu-
larity and was later adopted as
the Alma Mater. Beside this work
Mr. Baird has several other ac-
complishments in phases of Uni-
versity life. One of these was his
contribution to the founding of
the Pitt Players.

“Perhaps the

reason for my

contributions to the University at
that time was the scarcity of stu-
dents in school,” he said. “This
forced us to ‘double—in-the-brass’.”
And this "doubling-in-the-brass”
included editorship of the old
Courant—forerunner of the Pitt
News. Also, he served as execu-
tive secretary of the Alumni As-
sociation from 1914 to 1918 when
he entered the Army.

Was English Lecturer

Upon discharge, Mr. Baird re-
turned to the University as a lec-
turer in English. He left in 1924
to take a city job. Since that year
he has performed various public
services. These ranged from the
duties of executive secretary of
the city’s art commission to presi-
dent of the Pittsburgh Civil Serv-
ice Commission. At present, he is
senior research analyst and vice-
president of city planning.

As a playwright in his spare
time, Mr. Baird has written many
plays. His Mirage, a drama plot-
ted around Hopi Indian cus-
toms, has been staged in theaters
throughout the world.

We are pleased to see that the University Social Com-
mittee came out in favor of the long—sought use of the Com-
mons Room as the site of a Senior Dance and a Christmas
Dance this week.

It was half—hearted approval, to be sure, but it was the
biggest step yet in the two—year battle waged by the students

to secure such approval. It marked the ﬁrst time any one in
authority had deﬁnitely given a yes or'no answer on the is-

sue. That in itself is so unusual as to merit three cheers and
a tiger from students‘ who have been accustomed to buck-

passing and equivocation. S

It * *
We're sorry, of course, that the committee couldn’t see

their way clear to give a ﬁnal decision. It is difficult to see

I why a committee set up to regulate social affairs for students

should have to pass this decision on to a higher authority.
And it is inconceivable that the University Deans, to

whom the committee’s recommendation will probably be sub-

mitted, should have any real authority to decide the question

‘of whether the Commons Room may be used for a dance.

More likely, they too will decide that they have no ﬁnal
jurisdiction and will pass their recommendation up to the
Chancellor. By that time it will be too late to have a dance.

We think the Social Committee should take their author-

' ity in both hands and give a ﬁnal O.K. to the proposal if they

honestly favor it. Then, if higher powers ‘object, it can be
passed on to them. If no objection is raised, Student Congress
can-go on to plan its Senior Dance and the issue will be

settled.

And while we’re on the subject, we’d like to express
our appreciation to Bill McKinley and Howard Greenberger
who have pushed the issue. ' ‘

They made no fuss, no speeches, but.went ahead. and laid
their plans in such a way that University authorities could
not help but listen and approve. I ‘ '

PLAY REVIEW . . .

'Suspect' Worth Seeing

 

ny DICK Kovnitf

An old adage of the. theater states that a good show never
looks worse than the night before it opens. On the strength

of that adage, we’re going to say that the current Pitt Players.

offering, ‘Suspect,’ will be well worth seeing.
Actually, we’re not crawling very far out on our critical

limb, since the Players’ produc-9

tion of the British mystery has
much to recommend it, even in
rehearsal.

Foremost is the masterful per-
formance of Ruth Schwartz, who
never displayed her acting talents
to greater advantage than she does
as the suspected axe—murderess
based on the legendary Lizzie
Borden, of ‘forty whacks’ fame.
Schwartz Dominates Action

Even in Wednesday’s rehearsal,
hopelessly hamstrung by the ab-
sence or illness of most of the cast
and crews, Miss Schwartz cap-
tured and held our attention every
moment she was onstage.

As a woman who sees her se-
cret, suspected crime about to be
revealed and visited on the head
of her son, Miss Schwartz domi-
nates the action, even when she is
not speaking, projecting the tor-

ments of a ravaged soul beyond,

the footlights into the entire thea-
ter. Rarely have we seen such a
professional job turned in at the
Foster Auditorium.

The other roles of necessity are
little more than a frame for the

ovensar - - -

central ﬁgure, Mrs. Smith (Ruth
Schwartz) although Mel Silver, as
the newspaper publisher who ex-
poses her, plays the solid but un-
spectacular role with his usual
ﬁnesse.

Illness Hampers Rehearsals

James Hoobler was hampered
Wednesday (as were all the Play-
ers) by the absence of Dolores
Morgret, who plays his ﬁancee,
while he portrays the brilliant son
of Mrs. Smith. ~

Miss Morgret was conﬁned to
bed with the ﬂu, but was expected
to appear Thursday night, and herb
charms should alleviate Hoobler’s
inclination to woodenness. Mr.
Hoobler shines over some of the
other actors through his mastery
of a convincing British accent.

Dorothea Greninger, who plays
the publisher’s wife, is also con-
valescing from a severe illness,
but overcame it Wednesday to
produce a satisfactory perform-
ance.

Blasphemous 'Specia|' By an Jensen

Well, the numbers boys have ﬁnally hit upon a way to
chisel in on some of the Easter money. According to one
of the downtown papers, they have “taken this holy day
and stripped it bare with a blasphemous commercialization.”

This “blasphemous commercialization” is called the

“Easter Special.” It seems that the
gullible citizen who invests his
cash in numbers, instead of stocks,
is enticed into buying an oblong
shaped envelope. Inside of this en-
velope he ﬁnds what is usually re-
ferred to as a “hot tip.” The pur-
chaser is even advised on whether
the number should be “boxed” or
played“‘straight.”

But There's a Catch!

But here is the gimmick—and
the downtown paper doesn’t fail
to bring it to light—-the “special”
doesn’t say when the number is to

be played; the second Tuesday
after the ﬁrst Monday, the ﬁrst
Friday after the third Wednesday
or when the moon is three quar-
ters full. In fact the “Special”
doesn’t say anything. There’s the
number in heavy bold type, make
of it what you wish.

Now the fact that the num-
bers writers have jumped on the
Easter gravy train is indicative
of a great many things. First of
all, it proves that there are
many people who haven’t given
up being suckers even for Lent.

Next it proves that the numbers
people in some other city are also
selling “Easter Specials” because
our boys don’t have the ingenuity
to concoct such a sure-ﬁre scheme.
They are not progressive; they
lack foresight. They have been too
miserly to hire one of Pitt’s Bus
Ad grads.

Why Get indignant ?

But the point I want to raise
here is why should anyone get
indignant about the numbers writ-
ers cashing in on Easter. Everyone
else has been doing it, and for a
long time. The chocolate manufac-
turers probably clean up more on
the Easter season than they do on
any other. I ask you what does
chocolate candy have to do with
the death of Jesus Christ.

And for that matter, where in
the Scriptures is there anything

that says men and women
should deck themselves out in
ostentatious ﬁnery. Ask the
dress designers in New York and
Paris and, no doubt, they’ll dig
upa passage or parable to jus-
tify their annual pickings.

And, while we are at it, just
where is the difference between
playing a lottery’ and playing the
numbers. Many churches in the

district sponsor lotteries. Are they -

committing a blasphemy? Better
leave this for the seminary boys.
The only difference between the
“Easter Special” and the new suit
is that the guy who sells the

“Special” runs a good chance of.
landing in the jug.

  
  
     

 

long ago had to talk to ﬁve people¢

from a big Pittsburgh department
store before he could convince
them that his name really is St.
Peter.

Dr. Wilfred St. Peter, who pre-
fers that his students call him by
the modest title of “Doctor” in-
stead of the more exalted “Saint,”
has a whimsical, hesitant way of
telling stories on himself that
makes hishearers chuckle at odd
moments for weeks afterward.

Suspected Alias

Once, he ‘says, a stalled auto on
busy Forbes Street near the Uni-
versity was crushed between two

street cars going in opposite di-
rections. The driver, who had been
just as reluctant to be involved,’
was trying to push: and jumped-

out of the way in time, but a big

Irish cop appeared from nowhere
and started taking names and ad-
dresses of witnesses. _

The officer took the names of
two bystanders and then turned
and grunted at the physics teach-
er:

“And what’s yer name?”

“St. Peter.”

“Oh, Yea-h?”

Now that Hokuf has been named the assistant football

Jiri is probably one of
World Olympics. In his case, it was the 1948
winter Olympics at St. Moritz, Switzerland, as
a member of the Czechoslovakian bobsled team.

lHowever, life wasn’t too kind to him in that
winter resort town. First off, Jiri intended to
enter'the one—man cresta run.

But that hope was overruled when the Czecho-
slovakian squad showed up with only three men—
who, together with Jiri, were just enough for the
-four-man bobsled team.

Jiri Cracks Up

So an injury to Jiri in the cresta run would
have meant an automatic disqualiﬁcation for his
buddies.

That was only the start of things.

Next, while driving the second two-man sled,
he cracked up on the notorious Sunny Corner.
That crossed out his second entry.

But when everything was over, though, the
Czech four-man team ﬁnished ﬁfth in a ﬁeld of
thirteen. Jiri was ﬁrst starter—a position directly
behind the driver-—on that team.

Pasport to Pitt

Strangely enough, the Olympics indirectly be-
came his passport to Pitt. During his free time
from 1947 to 1948, the 5-11, 170—pound Jiri at-
tended a language school in Switzerland.

After the Olympics ended,” recalls the foreign
exchange student, “I refused to return to my home
in Prague which was under Russian domination.”

He later made his way to the United States and
Pitt as an exchange student.

Now a junior in the College, Jiri is majoring
in ﬁne arts and languages. A

IM Combined Team, 44-40

By DON SCHURMAN ‘

Appropriately climaxing a
season of upset thrills, the
Fraternity All-Stars surprised
the Combined All-Stars, 44-40, at
the Stadium on Wednesday night.

It was the ﬁrst post—season win
for the frat stars. The series rec-
ord now stands at 2-1.

Ronnie Weinstein, Dukes star,
continued in his usual role as top
man in the scoring column for the
Combined Stars. With 21 points,
he was the only player to hit
double ﬁgures. '

Weinstein converted seven out
of eight foul shots and missed only
three ﬁelders out of ten attempts
for a deadly 70 per cent shooting
average.

Not Enough A

However, 'Weinstein’s e f f o r t s
were not enough to turn the game
in favor of his team.

The Combined "Stars jumped off
to a quick lead and were ahead
through most of the initial period.
Then with seconds remaining to
the quarter, the frats tossed in a
ﬁelder to take a 12-11 lead.

The frats quickly extended their
lead_ in the second quarter,‘ and
with a holeless zone defense, led
22-15 at the half. Proof of the

tight frat defense was the mere 16
shots they allowed ‘the Combined
Stars to take through the ﬁrst half.
Uphill Drive

The second half opened with
the Combined Stars starting an
uphill drive. By the end of the
third quarter, they had narrowed
the frat lead to three points, 31-28.
The Fraternity Stars, however,
matched the Combined scoring in
the last quarter to hold their ﬁnal
44-40 edge. _

Although scoring one less ﬁelder,
the Combined Stars edged the Frat
Stars in shooting accuracy, 30 to
29 per cent. Each team had a
poor night at the foul line, both
erring on fourteen free throws.

The accurate shooting of Joe
Bendel of the Phi Kaps and the
ﬁne ball-handling of John Doyle
of Theta Chi were the main fac-
tors in. the Fraternity victory.

First Squad Game

Last Monday the squad “partici-
pated in its ﬁrst intrasquad game
at the Stadium. It served as a re-
minder to the players that base-
ball 1S still played on the diamond
and not in the pits under the Sta-
dium.

“Every one had a chance——about
50 candidates——to play a few in-
nings,” Mitterling said, “and each
pitcher went two full innings.

“As for a startinglineup, the
veterans have to be beaten out.
That’s allthere is to it.” 4

And the Panthers still have most
of last year’s team intact.

Veterans Hold Edge ,

The holdover inﬁeld is: John’
Marhefka (lb), Dave Devey (2b),t
Steve Pavlakovic (ss), and Joe
Ross (3b).

_ Lettermen Bobby Lewis (cf),
Pat Murphy (rf), and Sam Sha-
p1ro (If), combine to give the
Panthers a Veteran outﬁeld.

George Lowe, leading batsman
for the Panthers last season with
a .473 av_erage,‘has not been out
for pract1ce_so far. The center-
ﬁelder’s studies have not permitted
him to come out for drills.

I ‘Prometheus in Pittsburgh’

crowded Yugoslav classroom recently when Lawrence Lee,

associate professor of English, read his poem Prometheus in
Pittsburgh, before a crowded meeting of the Graduate English

Club.
Written in the form of a short
Greek play, Professor Lee’s poem

' uses again the figure of Prome-

- partment of speech,

theus the ﬁre-giver that has re-
curred so often in lierature since
the days of Greek myth.

This time, however,_Prometheus
‘b"ings a brighter, more terrible
ﬁre, atomic ﬁre. But the problem
of power still remains the same:
Will main‘ use his new power for
good or "evil?

It’s Up to Man

The choice is man's, the poet
says. The gods can give the ﬁre,
but man must decide how to use it.

The locale of the poem is an
idealized Mt. Washington, and

city

characters include Prometheus,
the man-god; Mia, a lovely woman
and also The Lovely Woman of
every man’s dreams; Michael, a
good hearted mill worker who will
ﬁght for, but not die for, his friend
Prometheus; and the Furies, a
stylized triad in the manner of
Robinson Jeffers’ women -of the
in Medea, as a chorus to
heighten action by description.

Villain Epitomizes Evil

The villain of the poem is Hal,
symbolic of the mental and spir-
itual ills of a society which hurts
its members and its future by its
own warped mind and actions.

Speech Course Analyzes

Movies as Art Form

By S. ALAN BOAL
Students in Buell B. Whitehill’s speech classes don’t have

to spend money on movies.

They've shown some of the

world’s greatest ﬁlms as a weekly highlight of Mr. White-

hill’s motion picture courses. ‘

But don’t think the associate
professor of English offers his ﬁlm
sections as relaxation for frus-
trated Pittites. Far from being
snap courses, his excursions into
the celluloid world require keen
minds and a desire to study hard.

Mr. Whitehill, head of the de-
continually
strives ‘to help students understand
the motion picture, not as Holly-
wood entertainment, but as an art
form and a vital social force.

First Study, Then See

After examining a picture’s
background through group discus-
sion and outside reading, students
see.it in class. Mr. Whitehill be-

’ lieves this method gives each pros-
pective cinema expert “a ﬁrm idea
of what constitutes a good ﬁlm.”

To show the medium’s technical
contributions in each country,

screen efforts from England, Rus-
sia, France, and Sweden, as well
as American ﬁlm classics.

Their development is traced
from the earliest pioneer attempts
through the advent of sound.

An alternate year course pre-
sents contemporary ﬁlms as types.
This modern course includes Nazi
propaganda ﬁlms and unusual ex-
perimental work. The Starﬁsh, a
French art ﬁlm shown last year,
was acclaimed for its surrealistic
treatment of the sex problem.

Practical Work

The second semester of this
course is devoted to actual ﬁlm
production on campus. Students
learn to work as a team in writ-
ing, directing, photography, and
editing.

Prof. W'hitehill's last production
crew made two successful ﬁlms
here. One was an experimental
study of motion, as seen in nature
and machines. The other ﬁlm told
a dramatic story, built around
Spring Festival activities.

Mr. Whitehill’s own great inter-
est is ﬁlm research. He often ex-
presses his annoyance at Holly-
wood for its indifference toward
studying its own product.

“You see,” he says, “no one has
ever ﬁgured out just what it is
that makes the film an effective
medium of communication. It’s an
art we need to study, for its tech-
niques are constantly revealing
our world in new and fascinating
ways.”

Film Series Planned

Prof. Whitehill is currently ad-
vising Student Congress in plan-
ning a weekly film festival for
April.

“This new idea will give every-
one at Pi“, an opportunity to at-
tend screenings of important Eur-
opean and American ﬁlms of the
last ten years,” he said.

The program will include a Dis-
ney favorite and the Italian
award-winner, Shoeshine.

 Poet Captures Spirit of City

The sky glow of a pouring open hearth moved into the‘

pears when he allows himself to
hate the sick Hal, and thus, by
succumbing to evil, seals his own
death.

But the ﬁnal tone of the poem
is hopeful. “Now man is better
than he was, and will be better
than he is,” is one of the conclud-
ing lines.

Full Life Suffers?

Prometheus had to suffer, Pro-
fessor Lee explained further dur-
ing a question period following
the reading, because a life too
fully lived, a love too great, must
always suffer.

Collins Stearn, composer now in
Paris, is writing a musical accom-
paniment to the poetic drama, Mr.

Lee said, and is approximately
three-fourths through with his
composition.

Pitt’s Placement Bureau is “big business.”
This year 105 companies have accepted the University’s
invitation to look over its crop of graduates. In a normal
-day 105 interviews are scheduled, allowing twenty minutes

‘for each.

“Technical jobs open to sen-
.iors this year far outnumber the
non-technical. Seven out of every
‘ten jobs offered are for seniors
‘with a technical background, es-
pecially engineering and chemis-
try,” says Charles H. Ebert, as-
’sistant dean of men in charge of
’ the bureau. ~

‘ 300 Companies Contacted
.5 Every year the Bureau, under
‘ the direction of C. H. Ebert, con-
tacts more than 300 companies, in-
‘viting them to send representa-
:tives to the University to inter-
view graduating seniors. Included
in the information given to the
companies is the number of sen-
iiors graduating from each school.

For Scholarship

“The Development of Modern
Civilization” has been chosen as
the subject for this year’s $500
, scholarship offered by the Scottish
; Room committee.

The scholarship is for the 1951
University of Edinburgh summer
school, June 24 to Aug. 4. Appli-
cants must be graduate students
or members of the Pitt faculty.

The Committee for the Norwe-
gian Room also announces at this
time that its $650 award for sum-
mer study at the University of
Oslo, June 23 to Aug. 4, will be
awarded to a graduate student.

Applications may be made in
1304 C1. The deadline for ﬁling
applications is Apr. 6.

ﬁnds out, the demand for college
trained people ﬂuctuates from year
to year. Although many a senior
is quickly disappointed by not
ﬁnding a “ready made” job, the
Placement Bureau spends a great
deal of time trying to [get him one.

The More the Merrier
With the increase of job open-
ings for graduating ‘seniors, Mr.
Ebert's time is no longer his own.

When asked how he liked the rush
and hub-bub, he answered with a
chuckle, “I don’t like it, just live
with it.”

“Actually,” he went on, “a large
graduating class. and 100 or so
companies interviewing makes my
job a lot easier. This way the stu-
dent worries about which inter-
view he is going to accept, and not

about whether he'is going to get
one or not.”

Mr. Ebert has been director of
the Placement Bureau for the past
ﬁve and a half years. Before com-
ing to Pitt, he spent three years in
the U. S. Navy.

concerns the misfortunes of a mis-

ed last season on Broadway and
in Pittsburgh with Sidney Black-
mer and Shirley Booth in the
leads.

The frustration inherent in the
situation brought on by Doc’s forc-
ed marriage to a girl he considers
beneath him, causes him to lose
ambition and results in his wife's
deterioration into a dreamy slat-
tern.

Lola constantly longs is repre-

of course, never found.

Back in 1928 Alcoa engineers pointed
out the advantages that aluminum
would bring to railroad tank cars
carrying hard to hold chemicals;
easily contaminated foods. So Alcoa
designed and undertook to pay for
the ﬁrst aluminum tank car. The car
builder and a shipper became inter-
ested. On completion of the car, the
builder (assumed the cost and leased
it to the shipper for regular service.

Interest in aluminum tank cars in-
creased. Impact recorders and strain
gauges gave the designers new data.
The aluminum production men rolled
the heaviest plate; made the largest
rivets produced up to thattime. The
second car was made from 8 instead

of 16 plates. Joining time cut in half I

Today three plates, plus‘ heads,
joined by newly developed welding
methods make an aluminum tank
car. And 1,300 of them, including the
ﬁrst one ever made, are in service.
Another instance where Alcoa en-
gineering and co-operation have
brought the advantages of aluminum
to a new application. Throughout the
Alcoa organization, in research, pro-
duction and sales, similar pioneering
jobs are in progress now and others
are waiting for the men with the
imagineering ability to tackle them.
