Grant Goes

To Psychology

Money Finances

_Graduate Students

A grant of almost sixty thou-
sand dollars has been awarded to
the University’s Psychology De-
partment. This grant will finance
the third year of a five-year pro-
gram.

The money will be used mostly
for aid to eight or ten full-time
graduate students specializing in
clinical psychology, including re-
search, diagnosis, and therapy.
Part of the grant will. help im-
prove the University’s clinical
psychology program by providing
for support of staff, additional
secretarial help, and the part-
time services of a psychiatric
consultant. A

Dr. George J. Wischner, direc-
tor of the clinical psychology pro-
gram at the University and pro-
gram director for the graduate
training grant, expressed hope
that the grant will be continued

~at'1east for the two remaining

years of the present program.

At that time, the University’s
program will be reviewed by the
U. S. Public Health Service. If
approved, the program will be
sponsored for another five-year
period. The total five-year grant
is almost three hundred thousand
dollars.

Freshman Admissions

For Fall Drop to 900

By VIVAY JAIN and ANITA CZUJKO
A spokesman for Everard K. Pinneo,.director of Univer-

sity admissions, lowered the figures for the number of fresh- .

men expected in the fall. At the same time, Lawrence Fox of
the office of Policy, Planning, and Co-ordination, announced
final plans for the freshmen orientation program to be held

next month.

The expected figures for the fall enrollment of freshmen

has been revised from 1,000. 120%

900; of these, 842 have been ac-
cepted and have paid their $50
non-refundable admission, fee.
However, the estimates are still
tentative. Pinneo pointed out:
“Some drop out after accepting
for numerous reasons.”

Fox commented, “freshmen ori-
entation has been revised so that
each student will receive com-
pletely individualized attention;
the l50 to 200 prospective stu-
dents will be tested, advised, and
entertained at each of the six ori-
entation periods this summer.

Planned Sessions
“The sessions are planned to
make the adjustment to college
life as smooth and pleasant as
possible. Since this is a required
activity for freshmen, they will
be the guests of University for a
three-day period, paying only for
meals. Parents are also encour-
aged to acompany students on this
visit.”

Tours of the University, meet-
ings with upperclass counselors,
sessions with assigned advisers.
welcoming addresses, aptitude
and placement tests, and a boat
ride on the Pittsburgh rivers are
some of the activities planned.

Dr. Carl E. Wedekind, chairman
of the Orientation Commitee, has

land Corporation, Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield announ-
ced today that the Board’s first order of business will be to

select a president for the organization.
Commenting on the selection of a head for the massive

redevelopment and expansion

program, the Chancellor said:

“We are canvassing the coun-9

try to find the right person. The
president of Oakland Corporation
must be a man of many talents——
one who will be creative in build-
ing the intellectual-cultural at-
mosphere of the area, who has
ﬁnancial acumen and solid busi-
ness experience, and who is an
expert in the field of urban re-
newal.” _

sistant chancellor for business af-
fairs at the University, was named
vice-president and treasurer of the
Board.

‘N0 Negative Exists in Nature’

Kenneth Burke Defines Mankind

By BARRY GROSS

Philosopher and music critic
Kenneth Burke gave nuclear im-
plications to a nursery rhyme.

After defining man in his lecture
last Monday, Burke quoted the
nursery rhyme which begins: “If
all the trees were one tree, what
a great tree it would be.” The
sentenc is repeated with reference
to men, axes, and seas.

The poem concludes: “If the
great man took a great axe, chop-
ped down the great treezg. and
threw it into the great sea, ’what
a great splash there would be!”

Substitutes Warheads

Substituting nuclear warheads,
ICBMS, military men, and land
masses, Burke paraphrased: “If the
great military man took the great
thermonuclear warhead and plac-
ed it on the great ICBM and ex-
ploded the great ICBM on the
great land mass, what great pro-
gress there would be !”

Burke had prepared the audi-
ence of 75 students and faculty
members for his use of irony

Man; Quotes
Cl1ild’s Rhyme

(Continued from Pdge 1)
by describing irony in his four-
part definition of man.

He discussed man as a symbol-
using animal; as the inventor of
the negative; as the being separat-
ed from his natural condition by
instruments of his .own making;
and as the being goaded by the
spirit of hierarchy.

“There is no negative in na-
ture,” Burke said. “We can con.-
ceive of blackness, but not of
nothing. The negative is the great
invention of the symbol-using ani-
mal."

Builds Character

Burke noted that “an indivi-
dua1’s character is built out of re-
sponses to various ‘Thou shalt nots’
—-—the very center of our moral
identity.” He explained that our
very ability to use language im-
plies the function of the negative
concept. “We know the things not
to call a tree. This ability comes
to a head in the use of irony.”

Burke suggested that while our
ability to symbolize allows us to
experience moments of great in-
sight, it also “subjects us to mor-
bidity and the spells of dema--
gogues.” He emphasized that we
have a narrow line of experiences
unique to ourselves and that the
greater part of our lives are based
purely upon symbol systems.

The lecture was presented by.
the University’s Speech and The-
ater Arts department.

Burlesque Research Advances

Speech Teachers Question Comic

Dr. Ralph Allen and Dr. John
Ulrich of the Speech department
are soon to receive a trunkful of
old burlesque skits and routines.
The material,‘ contributed by
Billy “Cheese ’n Crackers” Hagen,
old-time burlesque performer, will
start them, not on a new stage
career, but a book on the bur-
lesque theatre. '

For the past Week they have
been quizzing Hagen on all ele-
ments of his profession, using a
tape recorder to take down con-

versations, comments and reminis-.

cences of his life and career. The
object of all this is to study the
historical origin of burlesque,

the source of routines and how. '

they are used.

The pair have been doing in-
formal research for some time.

,They met Hagen over a year ago,

 , 115  Aydlvl.

and when they recently received
a Merril Fellowship to further
their project, they immediately
called upon him.
Long-Time Actor

Hagen, whose real name is Wil-

liam Hagedorn, has been in show

i business for 51 years, which even

he considers a long time. Al-
though he has not always worked
in comedy, he is known primarily
as a “baggy pants” comedian, aim-
ing mostly, as he says, “for belly
laughs.”
Comparing burlesque as it
was in his earlier days to bur-
lesque as it exists today, he said:

“The shows have always had an
element of sex. There would be

‘I6 to 22 chorus girls, and four
outstanding women for skits and
scenes. Economics and the high
cost of travel, baggage, and la-
bor have changed. the scale of
the ‘shows, and now most of
them have only seven or eight
people. There are almost no
women in the skits any more.”

Along this line, Dr. Allen com-
mented, “You must keep in mind

that the striptease was not known.

until 1930. Billy Hagen dates back
to the time when the comedian
was everything. He owned the

troop, produced the show, and was
the main drawing card. '
“This was real folk-comedy,
with standard situation and scenes.
It was family-style entertainment,
and in fact, Billy was onced ﬁred

for saying “hell” on the stage.
There would be up to 40 per-
formers in the show, with some-
times seven or eight in the skits.
“It was only when this enter-
tainment lost its audience to
radio and television that it be-
gan presenting the present type
of show, ,and cut its cast down

to six or seven performers.”

Arab Antagonized

By Firestone's Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a sarcastic tone pregnant
with heated fanatacism and blind
antipathy for the Arabs, I have
read the article written by Mr.-
‘ The writer—‘
false
propaganda—-felt no compunction
in distorting the basic facts of
the Arab-Israeli dissention and
his writing reflected a tremen-
dous lack of profound grasp for
the intrinsic nature of the con-

First of all, the Arabs had
never been defeated by the Is-
raeli bands in 1948, but rather
by the unfortunate circumstances
under which they acted. All
Arab countries were strictly com-
mitted by unequal ties to those
who had the keen interest in cul-
tivating this thorn in the Arab

ous conspiring and agressive plot-
ting, c 0 u l d Isr,aeli——massively
backed by England and France-
assail Egypt? She knew for sure
the likelihood of its entire elim-
ination once it gambled and initi-
ated spontaneously any
against the Arabs. What had tri-
umphed in 1956 was freedom, jus-
tice and the world public opinion.

What had been -ignominiously~de- “

feated was aggression and im-
perialism. ’

What remains to be empha-
sized is that:

1. There do exist about one mil-
lion and a half Arabs refugees
who live in extremely miserable
circumstances under the charity
if the UN “seven cents for each
day”. Unless they are going to
restore their lost homeland—by
whatever means they deem feasi-
ble—no prospect-for any peace-
ful settlement is likely. They can-
not be checked so simply by a
call for absorption and settlement
in other Arab countries. These
people should be repatriated in
their original homeland, Palestine.

2. The ostensible calls for
peace in Israel originate from hy-
pocrisy rather than from sinceri-
ty. The expansionist drive is still
the predominant feature of this
country’s policies. From the " very
beginning, it was born from ag-
gression and still survives on ag-
gression and its quest for lebens_—
mum is unhidden.

3. This country constitutes a
serious threat to peace and se-
curity in the Middle East and a
conflagration that may occur one
day will be extremely perilous
for world secruity as such. Un-
less a basic solution for the is-
sue ‘will be initiated, this precious
situation may erupt at any mom-
ent. ,

Eventually, .1 do believe that an
enlightened public opinion-—like
the American one—can'not be led
astray by such propaganda which
some people try to market.

‘Points’ the Way

The satire is as pointed as its author’s tail. The
"mole and his Gothic—type speaking cohort, Deacon
Mushrat, are microcosms of asininity. Deciding to
campaign against all "Johnny—come-latelies,” they
don indian garb and proclaim Pocohantas a traitor.
They consider fallout shelters for protection against
the population explosion. Abner Doubleday may
have been a loyal American, they reason, but
Doubleday was also a publisher; hence, “Beisbul is
the opiate of the people.”

Walt Kelley, iPogo’s “collaborator,” agilely
twists misinformation into the xenophobia typical

 

By Jim Hufnagel

of those frothing right-wingers presently sci?ei;§fﬁ.
ing their way into the American unconscious; Like

Voltaire and Swift, he follows a minor absurd'ity_ 

to its logically ridiculous extreme. Kelley, Al Capp,
Cy Hungerford and several others reign as deans of
contemporary satire. But theirs is graphic satire.
Literary satire seems to have lost ground on the
popular plains during recent centuries, perhapg
because more subtle intellectual
newspapercolumns, have arisen.

Except for A. J. Liebling, the late James Thur-
ber and other denizens of the New Yorker’s glossy
pages, proficient satirists are becoming as rare as

proficient blacksmiths. The difference is that the 

need for blacksmiths is lessening.

Delayed Reaction

Probably the principal difficulty with satire is‘

that its results are rarely immediate ‘and never
directly traceable to the author. It took several

generations of scientific and political upheaval to

prove that ‘Everything’ is not ‘for the best’; pet-
tiness and spite still exist, the Lilliputians notwith-
standing; drawings of donkeys a_nd elephants have
not destroyed the Democratic and Republican
parties. The most positive vehicles of social change
are assasination, revolution and terrorism. These

do the job and do it quickly. They are undoubtedly .

the easiest tools.

But the uses of violence are limited and dan-
gerous. Were we to begin hanging John Birchers,
Minute Men and others of that political bent, we
would probably find them multiplying faster than
we could build gallows. Or we could, as the Mole
suggests, develop a ‘clean’ bomb that kills_ only
people and leaves the. Empire State Building in-
tact as a one hundred and two storey headstone.
The fallout from small bombs, like Pogo’s little
handbook, is far less lethal, but much more likely
to mutate the undesirable genes.

Bigger the Better . . .

Disu

nity

Since I have been at the University "(two long
years now) I have been hearing plans to unite Pitt.
Football fans deplore the lack of unity because it
means that our side of the grandstand will not be
ﬁlled and Syracuse, or West Vir-
ginia, or whoever, will sneer at
us and mock our school spirit.
Girls in the dorms deplore the
fact that there is no big dance 3
where they can be sure the 
world will see them. Student?
Government advocates strong 2
central government which will‘
lead us fearlessly out of what- ,
ever troubles and tangles we ﬁnd
ourselves in, and WPGH holds
up to us the unity which it 
promises to provide for us, assomething to be
earnestly sought. Atop all this cry for unity no

one stops to think that this goal is unrealistic and

perhaps not even desirable. L
Coming from a small-town school as I do, I

have had twelve years experience with uniﬁed

schools, and it isn’t (if you will excuse the expres-

sion) “all it is cracked up to be.” My high school

was nam.ed, appropriately enough, United High.

It contained approximately 300 people, and every

one knew everyone else. In fact everybody knew

everyone else so thoroughly that the reputation one

entered the ninth grade with was almost invariably

the one he graduated with. Unity existed in abund-_
ance. The school prom was the dance of the year.
Everyone who was anyone went to certain football
and basketball games; it was cause for jubilation

if we won a game and tragedy if we lost. School.
plays and talent shows drew the largest part of
the «school. The school paper was almost useless
since everyone knew what happened as soon as it
happened.

-Same Leaders .
But amid this relative fury of activity no one

noticed that it was the same people who led the I

way in almost everything. This group of people
had its way, and the rest of’ the school population
was not powerful enough to put up much resistance.
Elections were only contests among a few who
already held everything. Also among the results
of this was an almost appalling conformity as
everyone tried to model themselves I after the
heroes. But here at the University, at least, one

    

By Susanne Eckman

has a variety of heroes to choose a pattern from.

Coming to the University has been a refreshing
change for me. There is a delightful variety of
interests among the students, and a large area for
conversation outside of who won the last election,
or how the team is doing, or the rest of the topics
common to everyone. I can ask someone how the
chess club is coming, or orchestra, or Pershing

Because of this, honors too, are spread around.
One person has no chance of winning everything
as in my school where a single individual could
be salutorian, social leader, the lead in the class
play, editor of the paper and “most friendly” in
the school annual.

Similar ‘Interests?

It is typical for people to get together over
things that interest them. But what, I wonder, does
a twenty-four year old commuting senior majoring
in chemical engineering, and interested in tennis
and golf have in common with a sixteen-year old
early admit dorm student majoring in ﬁne arts, en-
thralled by folk-singing and ballet? While an inter-
change of ideas would certainly be beneﬁcial to
both, the same standards cannot be held for each.

Yet, I doubt if real unity can come from. any-
thing other than common interests. We are loyal to
our country because it protects us, and to our fami-

» lies because of our close knowledge of them, and

because our interests and feelings are so inter-
twined. On the other hand a college is chosen
almost at random by some people, because of loca-
tion or because it will let them ﬁnish their edu-
cation quickly. The only thing the students have
incommon is a desire to be educated, and this. for
such a variety of ﬁelds that there is not mu.ch

I basis for comparison.

In all, I see no real reason for uniﬁcation. A
common interest in tuition rise is not enough.
There are few regulations which affect everyone.
All that is left is a desire foridentiﬁcation with
The group, a desire to prove one’s wisdom in choos-
lng 8 “great” school, or a wish to be important to
m01‘e D€0p1<=:(. None of these seem tome to be very
valid reasons. Perhaps I am making a mistake in
making a comparison without having gone to a
more uniﬁed college, but on the basis of what I
have seen of unity, I can do -without it.

scored the same day they are
taken; the results will be imme-
diately sent to the advisors, who
will be in a better situation to in-
form and help the prospective stu-
dents plan their fall schedule
more efﬁciently.

Pinneo explained that there are
three main reasons for the drop
in enrollment: “There is a national
dip in the number of 18 year-old
students, many students from this
area choose to go away to school,
and the University no longer of-
fers an undergraduate program
in Business Administration.”

The University had a fresh-
men class of 1100 in 1961 and
1350 two years back. In 1960,
61 percent of the students ac-
cepted attended the University
and last year the ﬁgures drop-
ped to about 47 percent.

Pinneo believes that the Uni-
versity is competing with pres-
ti-ge colleges of the East and stu-
dents apply to the University as
second or third choice to Ivy
League colleges.

Asked if, in his opinion, the in-»
creased tuition has aﬁected the
fall enrollment, Pinneo agreed that
it might prevent some mediocre
students from attending college.

The recent six—game winning streak of the Panther base-

_ Going strictly on percentages the chances of Bobby Lewis’

crew are not outstanding. Two°

the characteristics that the.Com-

“When appraising a team,” the
coach said, “their schedule is
checked to see what caliber of
teams they have been. playing.

The committee likes to see a team
that can win on the road since
that is considered tough.

“Also they check the team’s

A lot of teams have good records,

Review of ‘Don’t Just Stand There!’ _

Robb Tops

Kilgallen

By a Chin and More

.By MATTHEW NESVISKY

“The dangerous age for men is
forty-ﬁve to sixty, experts agree.
At this point women are just get-
ting their secondbreath and men
are losing their ﬁrst. In this age
bracket, women are preparing to
do andldye, and men, alas, to die;
women are planning to give up
potatoes and desserts and men just
to give up; women are pushing all
their chips on the table and men
are cashing theirs in.”

The above statement is a sample
of one woman’s opinion. And that
woman, who is quite proud and
perhaps amazed that she gets paid
for that opinion, is Inez Robb,
whose daily columns are syndicat-
ed in 132 American newspapers.

And the statement itself is
from Mrs. Robb’s first opiniomni-
bus, Don’t Just Stand There! (Da-
vid McKay Company, Inc.; 309
pp; $4.50).

Inez Robb possesses a quality
quite unique among newspaper
columnists: she’s usually right.
She’s a woman. and knows it;
indeed, she seems quite proud of
it as she campaigns for equal
rights for men. In her writings,
she admits that she tries to avoid
politics and preaching, although
she does ﬁnd herself in the mid-
dle of polemics and propaganda.

The result of this is that this
journalist’s collection of choice
columns show honest, American
common sense, linked with a well-
developed breeziness and, at times,
alglittering sense of what’s funny.

Mrs. Robb is far from being
a Dorothy Parker, but on the
other side of the typewriter, it.
is more than just the ownership
of a chin which distinguishes her
from Dorothy Kilgallen.

She has written (and still does,
of course) about people, places, the
past, present, future; in short,
things that the average newspaper
buyer is interested in and should
think about.

Her people range from her
grandmother to President Kennedy
to you, and the values of each,
Her places are generally America:
New England, Dixie, Texas, and,
of course, her native Idaho. Her
observations on the present and
future are often based on the read-
ing of an off-beat scientist’s theory
or a shocking bit of trivia from

some statistical computer. In all of
these cases, her columns invari-
ably reveal a greater or lesser de-
gree of information and entertain-
ment.

Mrs. Robb has a tendency to
drift into “When I was a girl,”
but it appears that she would be
the last one to beg for a return
to the past. She likes astronaut-
ism, hates pigeons (after all,
what do pigeons do besides —- ?)
and thinks every girl should
have a husband, preferably her
own.

Being a newspaperwoman who
must turn in a certain amount
of words each day, Mrs. Robb
often strains for her opinion and
humor, but she still manages to
top most of her contemporaries.
Don’t Just Stand There! should
be 200% proof enough.
