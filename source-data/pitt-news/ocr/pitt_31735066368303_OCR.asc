LIRN H e|psStudentsResearch

By JUDY GREER

Students given research assign-_
ments can make the research end of

it a little easier by using a database

literature search to find the referen-
ces they need.

This computer system, known as
the Library Information Retrieval
Network (LIRN), can be found in

A most departmental libraries at the

university, including ‘Hillman,
according to Pam Vance, informa-
tion librarian at Hillman.

‘_‘These databases are not replac-
ing printed indexes, because one
media does not do everything,"
Vance said.

She explained that different
strategies are used for different
things. For instance, the student
can get the best use out of the LIRN

before he/she receives

for a term paper rather than for a
speech.

, When the subject matter is of a
very specific nature or when the
topic entails two or more subject
headings, a database can be most

~ effective in finding out what sourc-

-es are available,’ said Vance.

Depending on the complexity of
a search however, the student may
have‘ to wait two to seven days
the
printouts.

Vance said that time is a factor.
“The system is a Locke computer
not a Hillman Library computer,”
she said, “and therefore, Hillman

may or may not have the source(s)

the student needs.” In this case, an

inter-library loan is needed.
Vance said, however that the

information in the databases is

Applicants for the new dual
law-business degree will have to
be admissable to both the law
school and the business school
and will have to be successfully .
tested on the GMAT and LSAT
in order to qualify for the
degree.

The program, being offered
for the first tirhein September,
will allow participants to earn _
both a degree in’ law and an
MBA in seven terms, as opposed I
to the usual nine. ‘

John Murray, the dean of

Students

have not been determined, -the
candidates’ applications would
go before a joint committee
consisting of administrators,
faculty and an associate _dean
_from each school_for review
after the student was deemed
eligible by the tests.

Murray said the advantages
of such a course study are
numerous. Corporations, for
example, will get a lawyer who
is also competent in business,
and a_ person in the business
world will understand legal
components. I .

usually more current than the.

printed indexes, most starting at
1970. While the printed indexes are
approximately three months
behind, the databases are only 24

' hours behind.

Sue Crosby, inter-library loan
associate, said, “the students who
actually follow the process
through" to pursue an inter-library
loan have to wait for the book or
article to come in.”

When an inter-library loan is
done, it usually takes two weeks for
it to come back to Hillman,Crosby
said.

She said that when a student
wants an inter-library loan, it is
his/her job to have a complete bib-
liographic citation.

A bibliographic citation is the

information necessary to locate the
full text of a magazine, journal or
newspaper article including the
title of the article, author, name of
publication, date, ‘and page
number. '
Each database is subject oriented
and most consist of a bibliographic
citation and, in some cases, an
abstract, said Vance. _ _
From there it is the library’s
responsibility to find out who
owns the book and to send for it.
There is no charge for borrow-
ing books, but journals cannot be
borrowed, so photocopies are
made of the articles needed. The
student pays the charge of $5.00 per
article needing to be photocopied.
Crosby said that she sees a lot of
people who have had computer
searches done come in to borrow an
inter-library loan and find they do
not have time to wait for one.
“Even when theyare working on
term papers, undergraduates usu-
ally don't start until midterms or
later and by that time it is too late to
use an inter-library loan,” Crosby
said. ‘

To speed up this process, Crosby. __

The LIRN Access Center is.there

"Since the LIRN is funded

 The Attraction Of 5   I

By LESLIE ROSS

It’s 1:30 a.m. and your stomach
begins to grumble. The chemistry
work you have been doing for the
last five hours hasjust about driven

‘you to insanity. You think about
the many choices open to you.
Instantly, a Domino’s deluxe pizza
with double cheese comes to mind.
You pick up the phone and dial. A
man greets you on the other end.

“Domino’s, can I help you?"

Since Domino’s Pizza opened in
September 1981, it has had great

. success with Pitt students in both

the dorms and apar.tments. Despite
complaints by students that the
prices are too high and the pizza

often tastes as if it was run off an’

assembly line, Domino’s continues

to rake in profits from the Pitt

campus. -
Holland Hall resident Tracy

Stipp said she chooses Domino’s“

because “their pizza is always hot
and delivered fast.”

Matt Mamajek, who lives in
Brackenridge, said, “you can get a
Domino's pizza almost any time
throughout the day.”

Other pizza shops in the Oak-

. land area deliver, most under 30
. minutes, which is one of Domino’s

slogans, and the prices of the pizza .

are less expensive. Yet,Domino's

ii continues to be the leader with Pitt

Napoli’s Pizzeria on Fifth
_ Avenue is running a special on its
large pizza—$4 until Feb. 8—and a
small pizza is selling at $3.90, the
regular price. I
Napoli’s also provides “fast and
free delivery,—””but' delivery hours
Monday through Saturday start at"
"5 p.m., and on Sundays start at 3
p.m. They deliver until I a.m.

days a week and deliver until 2 a.m.
on weekdays and 3 a.m. on the
weekends. ,

The prices of other places also
differ. Sorrento’s Pizza sells a
small, plain pizza for $3.50 while
the large is’$4.55. This shop also

_ offers free delivery and the hours

are almost identical to Napoli’s.
Domino’s, Pizza has a small,

plain pizza for $4.05 and a large for

$5.90. Clearly, Domino’s is one of

K the most expensive pizza places in

eit_a,

’- the Oakland area.

Students do not seem to worry
about their budgets too much; they
instead opt for fast, almost round-
the-clock delivery that Domino’s
offers. A _

The Domino’s franchise started
20 years ago in Ann Arbor, MI. and
has since grown. The manager of
the Oakland shop, Brad Bruck-
man, is only 20 years old and said
he was offered the position while
studying at Clemson University.

Bruckman is a salaried worker
and receives 25 percent of Domi-
no’s profits. He said the franchise is
a “big opportunity company” and‘
most of his workers have aspira-
tions of becoming managers one
day. He said he owes his'own per-
sonal success to the way in which
he was trained. -

“When I was trained, I was
taught that quality will be the
number one aspect to expect from
my employees," he said. “I show
them respect, and in return, I
receive it.” .

Domino’s attributes most of its
success to its customers. The shop
serves four colleges and the Oak-
land, Shadyside and Bloomfield
residentials. Bruckman said the
Pitt campus is by far the overall
winner in pizza sales.

“Pitt has far more students than
the other surrounding campuses,”

‘Bruckman said.
Running a close second is the.

CMU campus. CMU rates per cap-
but cannot compete in
numbers’ with the Pitt campus.
Carlow and Chatham Colleges also
add to Domino’s profits. These
schools take advantage of Domi-
no’s delivery service because they
are the furthest from the shop.
The workers at. Domino’s
include the pizza makers and the
telephone clerks. The workers start
at minimum wage and can increase
their wages if Bruckman sees

. improvement.

Domino’s delivery drivers get
paid minimum wage plus six per-
cent of what they deliver to custom-
ers. By giving them this, it also
works as an incentive to deliverthe
pizzas within the 30 minutes allot-
ted. -
The Oakland shop employs 60
drivers and will have as many as l0
drivers on the schedule for one day.

When Domino’s first opened, it
offered two free Pepsi with every
small pizza. Recently, the shop had
to raise its offer to 10¢‘ per Pepsi.
Bruckman said that increase was
due to the fact that the Pepsi com-
pany raised its prices. But, he said,
this is still less than the regular
price of a Pepsi and the customers
don't mind paying it.

“Yes, this is Joe College.‘I’d like
a large Domino’s deluxe pizza with
the usual items: pepperoni, mush-
rooms, onions, green peppers and
sausage, but could you add the
double cheese today? It’s finals,

because of an interrelated
knowledge of both fields."

Dean~Zoffer of the business
school said the program will
give students the opportunity to
look at two related areas in an
integrated way, whereas having
a degree in only one field would
not.

The. challenge of the pro-
gram, he said, lies in the pres-
sure on the students to “shift
gears.” The .methodology,
approach" and philosophy of

-the‘ law and business course
studies are very different, and
the student would have to make
the adjustment successfully.

Murray said that while the
student will be receiving the
full" flavor of the programs, he -

Degree isa Challenge ,
to Graduate Students

will not be relieved of the chal-
lenge of pursuing two disci-
plines that are both similar and
disparate. ‘

A student might have a law
class in the morning, a business
class before l-unch and another
law class after lunch, all of
which would be “equally diffi-
cult and mandate a certain way
of thinking,” Murray said.

Zoffer said that the attempt to
receive a dual degree should not
be taken lightly and the serious
student would be able to test his
different fields of interest.

Although there is hard work
involved, Zoffer. said the degree
would allow the student to
“broaden, increase and enhance
his career options without a
great deal of expenditure.”

“It (the session) let us set realistic
and feasible goals," he said. “lt also
made us realize it would be ‘silly to
put things down just to sound
good and never get anything
done.” _

After the conference, Downs said
he has several goals in mind for the
upcoming year. Downs said he will
work on organizing social and aca-
demic faculty/student forums, will
look at the effectiveness of the job
placement center, attempt to get a
universal parking permit for com-
muters and look into the past fund-

- ing of the Hand-in-Hand Festival

to see if any changes are warranted
in its funding.

Along with the goals which the
board will be working on as a
whole, individual board members
have also made personal goals that
they have set for their time in office.

Jeff Schaffer said he would like
to see the course descriptions dis-
tributed throughout the campus
instead of just Thackery Hall and
the Cathedral.

Jeff Delmontagne said he wants
to scruntinize the Towers Post
Office and see ifany changes can be

‘ made to improve it.

Kathy Brown and Barry Greene
want to‘ look at the possibility of
getting benches installed at the var-
ious campus bus stops and will
also be working on computerized
roommate selection. -

Dan Lecce will be working on a
universal parking permit for corn-
muters while Craig Murphy’s short
term goal will be to see why IDs
aren't being checked as carefully as
they should be at Trees Hall.

Mindy Goldberg said she will try

— to get preparatory classes for grad-
uate degrees (LSATs, etc.) brought‘

to the campus..

Downs said the conference was
necessary for the new board.
“I think the students deserve an

explanation of the management
skills that are necessary for the Stu-
dent Government Board to do an
effective job." he said. “Without
the conference, and the skills
reviewed, the SGB would be much
less effecti\"e."

Finally, the new board held its
first meeting Monday night and
four appointments were made.
Todd DeLuca, the 1982 president,
was appointed peer advisor—a

paid position—to the board. His-

job will be to help the board with
his three years of experience in Stu-

dent Government. Bruce Rogers,-

the president of the Black Action
Society, Kathy Brown and Dan
Lecce were appointedto the alco-
hol task force.

Student apathy continues to be the major problem on ‘most
college campuses today, according to a survey conducted by the
National On-Campus Report (NOCR).

t The NQCR surveyed a random sample of 1200 student govern-
ment presidents and college newspaper editors from around the
country about what they thought were the biggest problems on
campus and in the nation.

The number of students citing a lack of student input as the ‘
majorcampus problem doubled from last year’s survey.
Nationally, the student leaders said the federal financial aid cuts
were the biggest probl_ems and many said the students they re-

Rowley said,‘ “Since LIRN is
offered as a free service we have to
put limitations on it, however I
‘don't think we have turned anyone
away for using it more than three
times.” Usually, one or two
searches fulfills the student's needs,
she said.

runs anywhere from $50.00 to
$100.00. . .

i There are five vendorsjthat Hill-
man librarians have access to: Bib-
liographic Retrieval
(BRS), Lockheed (Dialog), New
York Times Information services,
Inc. (Information Bank), Systems
Development Corporation (Orbit)
and I.P. Sharp. These companies
provide nationwide service to
approximately 200 databases. V

According to Vance, most data-

social sciences rather than in the
humanities due partly to a reflec-
tion of the demand, but also
because the humanities are more
difficult to search. This difficulty
stems from the fact that to dda
search, “key” words are used to
locate the necessary information,

“The student should not have
the’ idea that for every subject
he/she can come up with, the
information can be found on the
computer; he should inquire rather
than assume," said Rowley.

When given an assignment, the
student should come to the LIRN
Access -Cente_r after they have
browsed through the printed
index, said Vance.

Vance also suggest using the ref-
erence librarian’s help in using
either the microfilm, which lists
the New York Times only a month
behind the most recent publica-
tion, or going on-line to answer a
very simple question, such as infor-

“Eventually, students won't be
able to avoid doing it computer
search," said Vance. .

She said some indexes are work-
ing backwards, for instance, one
started in 1976, and is now dated
back’ to 1970. Vance added that
probably what these companies are
striving to do is to end up with all
indexes on computer.

Students interested in having a
search done must make an
appointment by calling 624-4698

Unpleasant
  Surprise

The New York Times recently cited the ten-
dency in America to rate colleges primarily
according to the research and publication’
records of their faciilty. The importance of
research is nothing new at Pitt, where the
Faculty of Arts.and Sciences has announced
that it would protect research faculty when
implementing budget cuts, The placing‘ of
research above teaching in the priorities of any
college should, however, come as a surprise to
most students. * ‘ _

Reduced U.S. Role Would Strengthen NATO

By scon‘ REX

With elections being held
throughtout Western Europe in

the course of the year, it's time for ‘

U.S. citizens to. shed their neo-
isolationist skin. We should
become more aware of the anti-
"American feelings being voiced in
England and West Germany. We
should also be asking ourselves
whether we prefer to follow our
present course of diplomacy
through a system of entente or opt
for some other path of diplomacy,
namely detente.

When outstanding government
statesmen depart from the political
scene, their wisdom and ability to
work for long-range goals departs
with them. When Chancellor Otto
von Bismarck of Germany was dis-
missed from his post in 1890, the
alliances that he had forged began
to fall apart. The Reinsurance
Treaty of 1887 was an agreement
between Germany and Russia.
This treaty was conceived by Bis-
marck to clarify to the Russians
that Germany’s alliance with Aus-
tria was not directed against
Russia.

This was an inconsistent pattern
of Bismarckian alliances. Yet while
he was in office no war broke- out
between the three countries. His
successor, Chancellor Caprivi did
not renew the Reinsurance Treaty
with Russia. For Caprivi, it was
much easier to take sides in world
politics than to live with the incon-
sistencies created by the diplomacy

‘of Bismarck. '

By 1912, Europe was polarized
into two camps, ‘the Triple
Entente and Triple Alliancef
Because statesmen failed to under-
stand the Bismarckian method of
diplomacy, the die was cast for the
-First World War; a die that we now
realize helped lead us into the

 

Tm

-..  j

j
an

Second World War.

The troubles inherited by the
world of 1983 lay rooted in y the
aftermath of World War II. Like
Bismarck's departure in 1890, Pres-
ident Roosevelt’s departure in
April 1945-held disastrous conse-
quences. Roosevelt understood the
complexities of dealing with world
leaders such as Stalin and Church-
ill. He knew that the Soviet Union
would never again.allow Germany
to invade Russia via Poland. I
doubt ifF._D.R. had any misgivings
as to the future nature of the Polish
government. Roosevelt had great
hope for the United Nations. It was
through this World Court that the
problems ofthe post-war era were

, to be smoothed out. Had Roosevelt

lived, Germany might not have
been carvediinto East and West sec-
tors. At the time his wisdom was
needed most, F.D.R. died, and that
was his biggest mistake. His suc-
csessor, Truman, was nowhere
near his equal in terms of political
sophistication. Truman’s attempts

to bully Stalin into submission had '

the opposite effect. Once the West
decided to rearm West Germany,
the NATO entente was created.
In 1983, we are 38 years removed
from the end of World War II. After
this war, it was only logical that the
United States should assume the
leadership of NATO. Having
created a hostile reality, there was

no _turning back. The powerful A

right in America would have
nothing to do with treason, that is,
being on friendly. terms with the
Soviet Union. Today we find our-
selves in basically the same posi-
tion as we were in l950—with one

 

major structural-change.

As. Western Europe regains eco-
nomic and diplomatic strength, it
makes -no sense for the United
States to remain the dominant
member of NATO. Europe is not
our playground. We have finished
our job of rebuilding their coun-
tries. The continuation of Ameri-
can domination causes the peoples
of Germany and England to resent
American assistance.

The labor party in England and
the Greens in West Germany are

both gaining popularity and polit-
ical power. What the West does not
need is the crying of unilateralist
pleaing for a world without
nuclear weapons. NATO must
remain an alliance based on
strength. At the same time, the
United States should move towards
detente with the Soviet Union.

It will be much more difficult for
the Soviets to juggle China, the
United States, Japan and Western
Europe if these countries are strong
enough to conduct their own for-
eign policy. NATO must never
come to stand for the “United
States.” By decreasing our role in
Western Europe, turning the secur-
ity of those countries over to their
respective governments, we will
ease the calls for nuclear
disarmament. '

Realistically, the Soviets are not
going to invade Western Europe,
but they can gain political bargain-
ing chips over the United States by
sitting on the sidelines and watch-

ing NATO disintegrate. It is time.

that we begin to restructure the
NATO alliance. Serious attempts
should be made by our government
to correct the long-range problems
which face NATO. We can begin
this by acknowledging the current
shift in the balance of powers
which exist between Western
Europe and the United States.

At the same time, detente with
the Soviet Union should be on the

J

agenda for the Reagan administra-
tion. It does no good to solidify
exsisting alliances. Detente, as we
have discovered, is not a vehicle to
extract pledges from the Soviet
Union. Angola and Ethiopia are
proof of this. Butdetente does pro-
vide an atmosphere for the Soviets
and Americans to find common
causes.

One common goal between our
countries is to check the spread of
nuclear weapons. As Kissinger
said, we are forced to coexist with
the Soviet Union. Neither of us
looks forward to confrontation. If
we remain at a nuclear stalemate

with the Soviets it is to the advan-g A

tage of neither to launch a pre-
emptive attack. NATO must
remain unified and strong. A
weaker country often feels forced to
attack first. We do not want West-
ern countries to feel that the only
choice they have is to attack first.-
We need the continuation oftai

strong NATO, which will remain A

strong only if the U.S. relaxes its
control of the alliance.

If we continue to install nuclear

weapons in Europe, NATO will

come to stand for the United States. .
A system of ententes would then be

permanently solidified. The slim

chance that we have for a cooling of

tensions between East and West

would disappear. That ray of hope

is all that we have left. Let's not

shut the door.

Sadler said.

‘She estimates that about 80 per-
assaults occur

Women may contact PAAR
initially, or months, or even years
later. Families and friends of victims
also come to PAAR for counselling.

Sadler stresses that although
there are some characteristics com-

’ mon across the board, each case is

very different. Individuals are coun-
selled according to their own needs.

According to Sadler the three
emotions that most victims feel are
anger, guilt and fear.

PAAR wants to provide an outlet
for a victim’s anger. Sadler said the
victims need to know that “it’s okay
to be angry.” , j 

Victims have different reactions,
Sadler said, and she listed some
common fears such as going out of
the house, staying in, realistic fears

Sadler said.

The
    Legal

Rape, according to the 1980
edition of “Basic Criminal Law”
by George E. Dix and Michael
Sharlet, is “unlawful sexual inter-
course with a female without her
consent. Intercourse for rape
purposes requires penetration.”

Unfortunately, in many instan-
ces, a rape is never reported to
the police for fear of improper
justice. Anne Hyman, of Pitts-
burgh Action Against Rape, said
. that there _are many reasons why
victims don’t report the crimes
that have been committed.

She said people watch too
many television shows and
movies that show policemen
harassing the rape victim. The
I police ask explicitly what hap-»
pened and sometimes put the
blame on the victims them-
selves.

When a victim has been
through such an ordeal, she is
not in the mood to repeat what

_ has just happened, according to

7 Hyman. In real life, however, the

* victim sometimes feels that the

- policemen are sympathetic and
willing to help.

“If only more victims would be
willing to repeat their crimes,”
Hyman said, “it would aid greatly
in reducing the amount of rapes
that occur.”

Hyman said that there are
many reasons why a rape victim
should step forward and state
the case.

power that she lost during the
rape,” she said.

A convicted rapist stands the
chance of receiving a sentence of
10 to‘_20 years. There is a possi-
bility ‘f for parole, which dimin-
ishesthe amount of the sentence
drastically.

But the first—and hardest-
step is reporting the crime.

“One does not want to be
known in society as a rape vic-
tim,” Hyman said.

What happens when a victim
does decide that she will press
charges against her attacker?
The first step for the victim is to
get her case in order.

“It's very important» for the

picture of the crime,” Hyman
said. '

“It’s very difficult for a victim
to state her case whilestaring at
much bias. Jurists seem to
believe, at times, that it was the
victim’s fault that the rape
occurred, rather than the assail-
ant’s.” '

Often jurors believe that vic-
tims, because of their actions or
personal characteristics," con-
tributed to theoccurrence of the
crime. In other words, it has
been the attitude of some. jurors
that if‘ a woman is attractive and
is raped, she is as much to blame
as the rapist.

1

Once in court, the case may
last from a few weeks to several
months. Is all of the emotional
drain on the victim worth it? -
According to Hyman, it is.

“The community is very ignor-
ant on the issue,” she said.

She said that something must
be done, to try to stop ‘these
crimes, and that it is up to the
victim to help herself. ‘

“Nobody else can decide, for
the victim. She must decide for
herself what to do.”'

Rape is defined, in part, as
having unlawful sexual inter-
course with a female without her
“consent.” But this isn’t always
the case. -

“If a woman is, by reason of
mental V illness or retardation,
unable to give effective consent,
intercourse with her is rape-
regardless of any consent ( you
may think she has) given. Even
women of very limited intelli-
gence, however, are usually able
to give.a valid consent.”

Each state has individual laws
concerning rape. In New York, it
is possible to arrest and convict a
husband of rape if the parties are
living apart. In some states, even
if a husband and wife are living
together, the husband can be
convicted. -

However, before any convic-
tion can be reached, the victim
must first make the decision to

what other people will say, the legal
system and the police.

“Society tells us over and over
again, ‘good girls don’t get raped,’ ”
said Sadler. , . ‘

‘ This can make a woman feel like

the rape was her fault or that if she’ '

had been more cautious, the rape

would not have occurred. The legal’
system often encourages this notion ’

too. _ g
“The victim often feels she is on
trial,” Sadler said.

PAAR counselors try to reassure I

the victim that even if she made an
error in judgement, that gives no
one a license ‘to rape.

There are many possible physical
and emotional reactions‘ to rape,
according to Sadler.‘

“Nightmares are common with .

both adult and child victims,” she

- said. —

Other reactions might be a loss of
appetite, a drop in grades, insomnia,
problems in close relationships and
sexual difficulties. ,

Sadler also mentioned an article

_ entitled “Rape Trauma Syndrome,”

written by Ann Wolbert Burgess,
D.N.SC., and Lynda Lytle Hol-
strum-, Ph.D., for the September
1974 issue of The American ]our-
nal of Psychiatry. _

Burgess and Holstrum studied

their lives as a result of theassault.
Fear is one of the major feelings
present.

In the second phase, the woman
begins- to reorganize her lifestyle.
Phobias and nightmares are likely to
occur in this phase. Some women
move and some have their phone
numbers changed.

According to Burgess and Hol-
strum, “Fear of physical violence
and death was ‘the primary feeling
described.” They also mentioned
the idea of self-blame as a primary
reaction common, to rape victims.

Another point stressed both in
the article and by Sadler is that rape
is not a sexual crime, but a violent
crime. Satisfaction in the rapist
comes through controlling his vic-
tim. Sadler called this control the
“eroticism of rape.”

146 patients admitted during a one-- ~ ’

year period to the emergency room
of Boston City,HospitaL from July
20, 1972, through July 19_, I973, for
rape. Their analysis was based on 92
adult women in the sample.

The authors considered the sam-

ple valid because “disparate social
classes were included»-in the victim
population. Ethnic groups included
fairly equal numbers of black and

~ white women plus a smaller number

of Oriental, Indian and Spanish
women. n

“In regard to working status, the
victims were career women, house-
wives, college students and women
on welfare. The age span was 17 to
73 years; the group included single,
divorced, separated .and widowed
women, as well as women living with

.men by consensual agreement,

according to the article.

Burgess and Holstrum say that
“Rape trauma syndrome _ is the
acute phase and long-term reorgani-
zation process that occurs as a
result of. forcible rape or attempted

-forcible rape.”

In the acute phase, women have

Sadker said usually things like age;

and attractiveness don’t matter to a
rapist. It is more or less a myth that
he is looking for some pretty young

the only victims who“get assaulted,”
Sadler said. ‘ ’ —

PAAR is a membership’ organiza-
tion, located on Forbes Ave. in Oak-

land, founded in 1972 to help rape '

victims recover physically and emo-
tionally after a sexual assault. Their
services are provided free of charge
by trained volunteers and by
PAAR’s professional staff.-

There are two parts to PAAR’s
program: victim services and
education-prevention. They offer a
24-hour hotline staffed by volun-
teers who listen and list options for
victims and their families or friends.

Medical volunteers, who accom-
pany victims to the hospital, provide
emotional support in the emergency
room and make sure the victim’s
rights are not violated. —

Staff members accompany vic-
tims who chooseito prosecute in
court and act as legal advocates.
PAAR also provides emergency
transportation to the hospital for its
clients. ’

Counselling is provided by ﬁve
full-time staff members and a few
volunteers. The program provides
counselling for the individual,
groups, families and children.

“A large part of our program deals
with child victims,” said Sadler.

PAAR has an education and pre-
vention program designed to
encompass all age groups. They
have sessions geared towards the
elderly ‘as well as toward kinder-
garten students. PAAR has reached
some 27,000 public school students
over the past few years, according
to Sadler. i

The program is based on films

  Treatment

There is another source of
help for rape victims at the uni-

’ versity besides the Pitt Hotline .

and the Counseling Center.

For -those who feel that they
are in need of more serious ther-
apy, a research project is being
conducted at Western Psychiat-
ric Institute .and Clinic under the

direction of Dr. Ellen Frank, an‘

assistant professor of psychiatry
at Pitt.

Since April of I978, she has
been conducting an assessment
and treatment study of victims of
sexual assault. The study is
being sponsored by the National
Institute of Mental Health, which
is an instituteof the Department

A of Health and Human Services.

Among the several objectives

of this‘ study is to “describe the
characteristic response to sex-
ual assault and what that might
include,” according to Barbara
Duffy Stewart, program coordi-
nator for the project. —

One ofthree different modes
of treatment is randomly
assigned in the hope of helping
the victim to get over the proble-

matic symptoms of the assault. ‘

The three techniques are:

0Cognitive behavior ther-
apy

This technique attempts to
alter the “negative” thinking
patterns of the victim, alleviating

the symptoms of depression and _ ,

anxiety. Some people are
depressed, not by the world
around them, but by how they
perceive the world and how they
integrate negative events into
their perceptions.

“The object is to enable the
subject to think about a particu-

T lar experience in a more positive

light,” Stewart said. “For exam-
ple,.after a sexual assault, com-
mon symptoms are guilt, a real
diminished self esteem and prob-
lems in interpersonal functioning
with family and friends.”

One of the reasons the victim
feels this way, she said, is that
she expects her environment to
automatically react negatively to
her, and it doesn’t_.

This type of therapy usually

. lasts for about three months. It

consists of a one-on-one rela-
tionship between counselor and
victim in which they examine the
thinking of the victim and try to
change it.

“We have found this to be a

very effective therapy,” Stewart ,

said. The effectiveness of any

particular form of therapy is

measured by the significant
decrease in symptoms once
therapy is over.

0Syste_matic desensitiza-
tion behavior therapy

This mode is aimed at typical
symptoms of fear and anxiety
that are aroused in a rape victim.

“The basic principle of syste-
matic desensitization is that
someone cannot be physically
relaxed and emotionally tense at
the same time,” Stewart said.

The objectof the method is to

.therapy.

\

and once that is achieved, to
begin to deal with anxiety-
provoking situations.

For example, if a nurse‘ has
been raped in a hospital parking
lot and since has had a fear of
parking lots, her goal will be to
handle being in a parking lot,
without feeling fear or anxiety-"

To get the victim to do what
she had done before the rape
without anxiety is the main
objective. Achieving this takes,
on. the average, about three
months of ‘therapy.

This method is considered to
be particularly effective in con-
quering symptoms of fear and
anxiety. 1

‘It certainly can be
stressful with people
along the way with
'Talking
about the rape and
how it has affected
their lives can be diffi-
cult at times.’ "

“The beauty of both of these
therapies is that the victims can
utilize the techniques in other
crises-that they may encounter
throughout their lives,” Stewart
said.

0Treatment on demand or
non-scheduled treatment)

“After our first three years of
the study,” Stewart said, “we
were beginning to wonder how
much of the improvement we
saw in our victims was really due

‘to the passage of time.

“What we did in order to try to
test this out was include a third
therapeutic cell in which the vic-
tim would not actually undergo
structured’ treatment. What she
receives instead is a kind of non-
directive empathy in giving her a
way to deal with her stress.”

For this mode of treatment,
the victim does not come to the
office for an appointment, but
her counselor is available 24
hours a day by telephone to talk
as long as necessary about what
is bothering her.

This gives the victim the
opportunity to discuss her prob-
lems, and what the counselor
really does is listen.

V A t t ‘ _ _ _ _ H H 1 ‘_ t A .“‘lf the method is not approp-
. - ---" teach‘ the ‘victim how‘ ‘to ‘relax’, "" ‘ '

some real, real problems,” Ste-
wart said, “she wouldthen be
offered one of the other two
treatments. This has happene

several times.” i S

Kay Kendall, a counselor with

the program, has been involved
with five cases in this type of
treatment. .

“For some people, it has really
been all they needed,” she said,
“but for some people, it hasn’t
been.” ’

She has received a’ few tele-
phone calls in the middle of the
night, but none of /them has been
a life-threatening situation.

“The main thing is to try to
relieve that crisis situation for
them,” Kendall said.

There are three counselors
involved with the project, and

there were about 100 women_

who had initially agreed to
receive treatment.

Lately, they have started to
counsel women who are not
necessarily victims of recent sex-
ual assault, but who have asked
for counseling concerning a rape

' that happened a long time ago.

They have also begun to see vic-'
tims of attempted rape.

“Most of the people have a
reason for coming, and most
people are not in a situation
where they are being forced to
come here,” Kendall said. “Most
people are motivated on their
own.”

Kendall, who has been work- ‘

ing with the program for a year
and a half, said that about 5 per-
cent of the people she has seen
have dropped out of the project.

“We recognize that this may
not be what everybody needs

, and that they can decide that this

isn’t something they want to con-
tinue with,” she said.

Kendall said that some people
drop out of the project because
they find they don’t need it any-
more. For others, the timing isn’t-
good, and some people aren’t
ready to face up to the rape yet.

“It certainly can be stressful
with people along the way with
therapy. Talking about the rape
and how it has affected-their lives
can be difficult at times.”

The project includes follow-up
interviews every six months to
see if peoplestill have an emo-
tional reaction to the assault
over a period of time, and also to
see-how well they are improving.

There is no charge to partici-
pate in the program, and -it is
open to women of all ages.

Kendall said that since work-
_ing with the project, she has
become aware of things like
walking alone at night and lock-
ing her car door while driving.

“Almost everyone in the pro-
ject has remarked about having
feelings of being frightened,” she
said. “When you work three
days a week all day with people
who have been raped, you start

' paying much more attention to

it. You realize that it doesn’t just

The Pitt Panther wrestling
team hadits record drop to 4-2
last night when it lost to Cleve-
land State 26-12 at the Field
House. '

The Panthers lacked aggres-
siveness against the ‘Vikings
and only managed three wins
and a draw. 8 ’

“When we’re not intense on
the mats, we’re a mediocre

8 team'',.’’ said Pitt coach Rande

' Stottlemyer. “We didn't get
blown out, but I know we could
have done a lot better.”

_ Pitt freshman Kyle Nellis fell
behind 2-0 in the first period on
a John Velinesis takedown.
Nellis then scored a pair of
escapes, but Velinesis scored a

-takedown and nearfall to take a
‘ 7-2 lead in the second period.
In the third, Velinesis scored
an escape and takedown to end
the match at 10-2. The loss
dropped Nellis’ season mark to.
1 1-3. «
At l26lbs., John Hnath
battled back against Cleve-
land’s Jerry Urry for an 8-8 tie.
Hnath opened the match with a
takedown and nearfall to take a
'4-0 lead but gave up an escape,
takedown and two nearfalls to
trail 8-4 at the end of the first
period.

The second period was score-
less, but in the third, Hnath
came back with an escape, and
takedown and scored riding
time to even the match.

At l34lbs. Pitt’s Joe Throck-
morton’s first period takedown

gave him a 2-0 lead against '

Cleveland’s Dave Budnar. In
the second and. third periods,

(Despite Joe Throckmorton’s (top)_ 10-2 -win over Dave Budnar of Cla tate, the
he Vikings, 26-12 last night at the Fitzgerald Field

match with a takedown in the

At l50lbs. freshman Joe Bond

_takedown against Viking Jeff

fall to take a 5-0 lead in the first
period. The rest of the match
was scoreless, ‘ending at 5-0

opened the match with a take-
down but was quickly coun-
tered with a Jelic reversal that
evened the match at 2-2.

A Cole escape made the score

Cole escaped early in the second
period, but Jelic double—legged
him to the mats, which tied the
score at 4-4. Cole scored an
escape, takedown and nearfall,

could only muster an escape,
while Cole stalled his way to a
9-7 win. '

Pitt’s Doug Haines, who
made a move up to l67lbs.,
defaulted to Matt Dulka
because of injury. Haines
injured his knee in the first
period and eventually had to

uit.

At l77lbs., Pitt’s Frank Rich

.and Cleveland's Vince Sakas

battled to a scoreless first period
tie. The only scoring in the
second period came on a Sakas
escape. In the third, Rich

escaped to tie the score, then‘

Although dissapointed over-
all, Stottlemyer did see bright
spots in the Panther lineup.

“John Hnath did a fine job in
coming back, and I've never
seen Joe Throckmorton wrestle

a better match. He kept wres-

a Challenge In Ewing

ﬁrm

By TODD ERKEL

The area surrounding Landover,
Md., isn’t well known for its moun-
tainous terrain, but don’t tell the
Pitt Panther basketball team; they
know they're about to enter the val-
ley of the not-so-jolly giant,
Patrick Ewing.

The 7-6 Panthers will introduce
themselves to the 11-4 Georgetown
Hoyastonight at the Capital Cen-
ter. When they make that first trip
down to the floor, the seven-foot
Ewing will be waiting with open
arms.

The ups and downs of the Panth-
ers this season are best illustrated
by citing their performance last
‘week, during which they stumbled
over themselves in a 66-48 loss to
Villanova only to get back up and
deck West Virginia 8l-67.

Will the real Pitt Panthers stand
up tonight against Georgetown?

.“I really believe that if we play
like we did in the West Virginia
game,we can stay in the basketball
game," Pitt ‘coach Roy Chipman
said.

The key to the Panthers‘ victory

the play of junior guard Billy Cul-
bertson, whose scrambling defense
and command of the fastbreak
brought the word intensity back
into the Panthers’ vocabulary.

“I think the key is that we take
the right fastbreak and not just
come down and throw up a crazy
shot,” Culbertson said.

“If we can get the ball, we can,
‘ fastbreak against them," Chipman

said. ’

With Ewing patrolling the
painted area, that “if" looms rather
wishfully, unless tonight's officials
choose to look the other way when
the Panther rebounders climb
aboard the USS Patrick.

“I happen to feel that George-
town is the most awesome team in
the league, physically," Chipman
said in a tone that suggested he was
happy to have played the game in a
time of the smaller and slower
athlete. *

Geurgetown's defense, especially
its full court pressure will dictate
the game’s tempo. Pitt’s inability
to handle such pressure turned the
Syracuse game from a basketball

game into a track meet, in which

Outside shooting by Pitt guard Joey David is needed

N arrow Escape  

Swimmers Edge Penn State On Final Event, 63-50

By MARK A. SINDLER

Perhaps it was fitting for two
staunch rivals to end a hotly con-
"tested clash on the final event of the

—: meet. The Panther and Nittany

Lion swim teams went head-to-
head Saturday at Trees pool.

As the swimmers mounted on
the blocks for the last event—the
400-yard freestyle, Pitt was cling-
ing to a narrow 56-50. Led by
anchorman Doug Bahan, the
Panthers pulled out ahead of Penn
State, finishing with a time of
3:10.47. This gave Pitt a 63-50
victory. .

Commenting on Bahan’s clutch
performance, diving coach Julian

Krug said, “It was a little tight

Doug was swimming because he
was a significant factor in the
win."

The meet started off with the

.400-yard-medley relay. Pittwon the '

event with a time of 3:35.92, under
the aggressiveness of Ed Bergan,
Doug Condon, Geoff Emore and
Jerry Zaleski.

Taking the top spotsin the 200-

yard freestyle were J.D. McCrillis

and Zaleski. In the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley, Bergan placed first
with a time of 2:00.71 followed by
McCrillis with 2:01.99. In the 100-
yard freestyle, Bahan finished first
at l:47.7 McCrillis was close

behind with a time of 1:47.88. '

-tory. “We’re always recruiting

against them and since it’s an area
school, getting the win means
much more.” '_

Both Lewis and Krug antici-
pated that the meet would go down
to the last event and gave Bahan, a
transfer student from Penn State,
many thanks.

“(Bahan) is doing exactly what
he should be doing at this point,
and he's getting better with each
meet," Lewis said. “As far as decid-
ing who would win it, we knew
that it would go down to the final
relay."

The Panther diving team fared

well against Penn State, and partic-
ularly well against Nittany Lion
junior Dale Dmitrzak who quali-
fied for the NCAA pre-qualifying
meet with 302 points in the one-
meter dive. .

Off the one-meter board, the Nit-
tany Lions swept the first two posi-
tions, with Pitt freshman Mark
McCormick taking a distant third.
According to Krug, the big surprise
was the three-meter dive.

Walk-on Mike McCalley fin-
ished second in that event, ahead of
Dmitrzak. “He did an outstanding
job on the three-meter board,”
Krug said.

Krug will have to utilize this
inspiration and , perhaps much

more when the Panthers’
swimmers and divers meet LaSalle
on Saturday.

Krug’s main concern is the Ber-
gere brothers, a twin diving
menace that would look impressive
on a Hollywood movie script. Both
Chris and Phil Bergere finished in
the top six in the state high school
finals last year.

“They ’(LaSalle) are ‘much
tougher than Penn State," Krug
said. “LaSalle is significantly bet-
ter; it's not to say we cannot win,
we can."

“Their offense comes off of their

One quality the two teamsshare

Brown Sets High

. Houston photo

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Garland Brown is not your typi-
cal athlete. The junior middle dis-
tance runner excels both on and off
the track.

For example, ' Brown was a
member of a Maryland state base-
ball all-star team, class president
and the Maryland State 880-yard
run champion during high school.
While ‘at Pitt, Brown has been a
member of the two-mile relay team
that broke an NCAA record; he also
maintains a B average in informa-
tion science.

Brown has many high goals for
the next two seasons. _

“I want to be a member of the
world record two—mile relay team,”
Brown said. “By my senior year, I
want to be a national outdoor All-
American in either the mile run or
the half-mile run. I have other ulti-

' mate goals that I~will strive for

until I am unable to compete at a
desirable level; only then will I
consider them beyond my reach."

Brown ‘is an ideal athlete for a
coach. Not only does he have the

talent, but he’s determined to get_

the most out of this talent.

In reference to Brown's ability,
head coach John Vasvary said, “He
is ever so fluid. His form is one that
every great runner strives for. He

  Goals Forself, Pitt  

has _the ability to shift geags-“so
smoothly that often times the
naked eye can’t pick it up."

Brown , has many individual
honors in his personal history, but
for the 1983 season the team is his
primary concern.

“I don't consider myself the
superstar,” he said. “I’m a team
player whose desire is to be thought
of as someone that the rest of the
team can count on.” 2
- “He cares a great deal about the
team," Vasvary said. “He would
probably "sacrifice the individual
accomplishments for the good of
the team. HE is a quiet leader who
speaks through his actions.”

Being a member of the two-mile
relay team at Pitt is Brown's pride
and joy. Along with teammates
Terry Gallagher, Todd Colas and
Darren Geary, Brown has a few
goals he is intent on attaining.

“First, we want the gold watches
at next week's Millrose games.
(Gold watches are awarded to the

2 winners of the events at the games.)

Second and third, we want the
national and world records. As a
team, our potential is unlimited."

It would be easy to say that
Brown is overstating the capability
of the two-mile relay team, but
there are results that back up his

C forecasts.

;P‘a_ge 1:7 ._ 

All four of the team's members _’

participated a year ago and not
only set the school record, but also
broke» the old NCAA record. This

, past weekend, the team erased its
year-old school mark while break— 2

ing the Eastman Kodak Invita-
tional record. Their time of 7:24.4
is a mere 2.8 seconds behind the
world record set 10 years ago by the
Russian national team.

The national respect that the

‘Panthers deserve has not come

about the way that it should have.
Brown said he believes that next
weekend at the Millrose games ev-
eryone will realize that the Pitt
two-mile relay team is among the
nation's best.

“Too many people think that
we're a fluke,” he said. “We’re
going to prove that we aren't. The
only way to do thatis by winning."

If the national and world records
are destined for the 1983 season, the
Panthers may be in a class by them-
selves. When competing for world
relay records, the competition is
basically national team competi-

tion. It would be an honor if the.

two-mile relay team could erase the
milestones of outstanding national
club‘ teams. Only time will tell, but

one thing will remain constant.
That is the consistency of Garland '

Brown.

t Lady Panthers  
Moving On Track 

By DALE MOORE

While other students used the
long weekend to rest up for the

long term aheaid, some others were ~

very busy representing the univer-
sity. The Pitt Lady Panther indoor
track tearnJtravelled to the Lady
Buckeye 'Invi_t-ational at Ohio State
University last Friday and Satur-
day and gained some respect and
much needed experience.

The standout for the Lady
Panthers’ was Renee Henderson.
’Henderson placed second in the
300-meter dash with a time of 40.0,
‘fourth in the 60-meter dash at 7.8
seconds and was also a member of

. the 1600-meter relay team, which

placed ‘second. Henderson teamed
with Sue Torre, Gail Counts and
Marsha Hawkins to ‘bring the Lady
Panthers a second place finish.

The weekend also had its
discouraging moments. The Lady
Panthers 800-meter relay team,
after running a very strong race,
was disqualified. Also, a rearrange-

ment of the schedule forced Haw-‘

‘kins to compete in the 60-meter
hurdles immediately after running

. , her leg of the 800-meter relay and

she failed to qualify for. the finals.
Also, the Lady Panthers were hin-
dered by the loss of Chris Crun-
kleton, who was outwith a strained
quadricep muscle.

Coach Elbert Kennedy was
‘pleased with the performance of
his ..young squad. “The girls
showed mea lot this weekend,"
Kennedy said, noting thatof the six

- girls who participated in the meet

only‘Henderson is not a freshman-.
“Renee is the old woman of the
squad, and she is only a sopho-
more,” said Kennedy.

()PS!!

UNIVERSITY TRAVEL s

- high school.

Kennedy also pointed out that
the Lady Panthers went up against
some stiff competition last week-
end. The host Lady Buckeyes of
Ohio State along with the women
of Illinois and many other Big Ten
schools who were present represent
some of the toughest competition
the Lady Panthers will face any-
where. (As an example ofhow diffi-
cult the opposition was, Kennedy
pointed out that in the 1500-meter

run Amy DiFrancesco ran her best '

time—4:58, yet placed ninth.)
Kennedy said that running against
this caliber of competition is
important because of the,exper-
ience that can be gained from it.
“Right now, it is important that
these girls compete," Kennedy
said.

With youth abundant on his
team, Kennedy is‘ enthusiastic
about the future and is spending a
large amount of time looking for
the right recruits to help his team
move to prominence in the East.
Like a great chef who must decide
on just the right ingredients to pre-
pare a gourmet dish, Kennedy is
seeking reco he believes can fit in
and bring a winning program to
Pitt.

In his search for just the right
recruit, Kennedy may pursue the
athlete who places second harder
than the athlete who places first in

“I want an athlete I think can
developand improve rather than
one I think may have already
peaked,” Kennedy said.

The Lady Panthers are in the
developmental "stage and under
Kennedy should continue
improve. One could say that
Kennedy has the Lady Pantherson
the right track.
