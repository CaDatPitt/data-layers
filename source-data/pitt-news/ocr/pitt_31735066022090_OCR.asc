divides time
between US.

ByiDavid T. Welch
Staﬂ’ Writer

Former Pitt President Wesley Posvar
has a 12th-flooroffice in the Cathedral of

 Learning and an “honorary professorship,”

but he is no longer employed by the
university, according to university relations.

Since his retirement, Posvar is not an
official university administrator, but “I am
a supporter and a professor, and I'll support

. in any way I can,” Posvar said.

Posvar said he was “totally optimistic”
about his successor J. Dennis O’Connor
and had “the highest confidence in his
leadership.”

Posvar was at Pitt yesterday “just to
check the mail,” he said. He is currently
working with the Environmental Protection
Agency and the International Institution
for Strategic Study.

Since he left Pitt last July 31, Posvar said
he has vacationed very little. “I was hoping

a for more of that. I'm spending most of my
" time doing public projects for the United
States government," Posvar said.

“Environmental affairs and foreign policy
are my next set of priorities. I am chairman
of the advisory council on policy of
technology [for the EPA], and we were
planning our meetings for the next year,"
Posvar said. i

Posvar, who just returned from some
EPA business in Washington, D.C., will be
leaving for Europe next week, where he
will join other colleagues in the field of
international affairs at the International
Institution for Strategic Study to discuss
“the headlines of the last week [concerning
the Soviet Union]”, Posvar said.

This institution is “a world organization
concerned with foreign policy involving

public officials and scholars,” Posvar said. ’

Posvar said his educational background
led him into the mainstream of international

1, political policy—making.

“My whole career [centered around
foreign affairs]. I studied foreign affairs at
Oxford and Harvard, and my Ph.D. is in
foreign affairs. I was a professor of foreign
affairs at the military academy. Henry
Kissinger was on my doctoral committee
at Harvard, and General Snowcroft and I
were at the academies together," Posvar
said. i

Posvar discussed the future of the Soviet
Union. “We live day to day with the
headlines. We're »worried about the
disillusionment and the economic chaos.
We ‘re worried about the nuclear weapons,
12,000 of them, with no government
supervision," Posvar said.

Posvar also expects a shakeup of the
Soviet Union's political infrastructure.
“There will be some degree of
confederation  looser with most of the
republics [still intact]. But I think the Baltic
states will completely separate. Some

Lantern Night inducts Women

By Laura Gallagher
sum’ Writer

At last night’s 70th annual Lantern Night
ceremony, Anne O’Connor, Pitt President J.
Dennis O’Connor’s wife, compared the first-
yearstudent experience to her arrival to the
University of Pittsburgh.

“This is also a new beginning for Dennis
and ‘myself. We too are in a spirit of
excitement and anticipation," Mrs. O’Connor

said.

In her speech to about 160 female first-
year students, Mrs. O’Connor rerninisced

_ about her first days at college in Chicago.

“Looking around the room, I_ remember
when I first arrived at college  I wondered
howl would make new friends  I think I
really needed a lantern myself," she said.

The evening began with students
processing to the Cathedral of Learning

commons room, guided by members of the '

Inter~Fraternity Council. .

The students were greeted by Virginia
Dunst, president of the Alumni Association,
and Darya Lehrich, external vice president
of the Panhellenic Association.

“You are demonstrating your choice to

become an integral part of the this university,”
Dunst said to the ﬁrst—year students.
President O’Connor also spoke at the
ceremony. “For many centuries, the lantern
has symbolized truth, virtue and the search
for understanding  Find that truth. Search
for that understanding,” O’Connor said.
Mrs. O’Connor gave advice to the female

' students. “You will have books to read, tests

to take, papers to write, and for those of you
living away from home for the first time, you
will have many important decisions to make
 You will learn some unpleasant things,
but with guidance, you will find your own
way.” V ‘

She also offered support, saying, “We will
do everything we can to help you along.”

After Dunst recounted a brief history of
Lantern Night, alumnae “ﬂame bearers"
holding white candles _lit the students’
lanterns. ’

Students and alumnae sang the alma
mater, led by the Pitt Women's Chorale.

“I am very impressed by Lantern Night,”
Mrs. O’Connor said. “I wish in my freshman
year I'd had such an experience."

Pitt is spending $75 million for ‘
construction and renovation,
including the $11.7 million
Pittsburgh Technology Center and

a new dorm which will house
612 students. , _ I

The new dormitory, which is
costing the university an estimated
$26 million, will have its own
cafeteria, commons area and
computer center. It will be located
next to the fraternity houses by
Pitt Stadium.

— The dorm is scheduled to be
completed on Aug. 25, 1992.

Associate Vice President of
Facilities Management Thomas
Hussey said, “Construction is
under way, and the project is on

The members of the Alpha Phi Omega
chapters at Pitt and West Virginia University
have been running an A80—mile distance
between the two schools every fall for the
past 20 years.

The run, which benefits the ‘Autistic’

Society of America, is traditionally held
before the “Backyard Brawl,” the Pitt~
WVU football game. .

Lisa Ballehr, president of the APO
chapter at Pitt, said all students can join
the run, which leaves Pitt Stadium at 9
a.m. on Friday. Each runner is required to
raise $15 in pledges to participate.

“You don’t really have to be in shape,”
she said. “You get in a car, then you run

who's running. Last year there were about
35 or 40 runners in a relay, so you don’t
really have to run that often." I

As some runners end their 50-yard sprint
and others begin, they exchange ‘a
ceremonial football which will be handed
off at the Pitt—_WVU game Saturday.

Once the runners reach the WVU
campus, both APO chapters will hold
other fund-raising activities.

“We have all kinds of special programs
and carnivals  [We get] the whole student

body, plus everybody that’s going to the’

game — the community and the
merchants,” said Dan Torisky, president
of the Autistic Society of America. —

money is collected, it goes right. into

The ASA, in addition to performing job- ,

placement services, provides job coaches

coach for his own autistic son, Eddie, who
works as a janitor at Apel Instant Printing

Betsy Desmond, a secretary at Apel, ‘

said it was difficult to say exactly how
Eddie differs from other employees except
that “he can just do one thing at a. time."

Safety classes emphasize avoiding assault

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

JoAnn Mallamo “thought she

‘was going to die" when she saw

6-foot, 250-pound Curtis Smith
running toward her at top speed.

Mallamo, who attended Srr1ith’s
personal-safety classes two years
ago, was participating in a drill
teaching students how to push
an attacker away. Smith's classes
operate on the “buy yourself a
minute" principle, which
emphasizes avoiding an attack
before it happens.

Smith, a ‘Pitt campus police
officer recently inducted into the
Martial Arts Hall of /Fame, also
teaches more convehtional self-
defense technique?!

“We had to pair ff and practice
pushing someone,/‘down, and then
they would push us off them,”
Mallamo said. “T he girl and I who
were paired together weren’t
pushing each other off real hard
 and [Smith], saw us and said,
fYou’re beingwimps.’  He comes
running at A from across the

room, and I started to scream,
- I

 

and I thought I was going to die"

Mallamo started to laugh and
then insisted she couldn't push
him off. But she did.

“If I can flip him off, I can
handle anyone," she said.

Unlike most self-defense
classes, prevention is emphasized
in Smith’s classes, which are
offered Thursdays at 6 p.m at the
Oakland School of Performing
Arts on the corner of Forbes and
Oakland avenues.

Students are taught not to place
themselves in a situation where
they might be attacked.

“What people really don’t_

realize is that you will actually
survive out on the street by using
thy wit rather than thy brawn,"
Smith said.

Self-defense goes beyond

knowing how to ﬁght, Smith said. -

“Peoplethink this is all I need, to
know how to kick and punch.
No. You have to be tactically
superior." '

He said he concentrates on S

“how you can identify when
you're being set up, to get you
prepared to avoid it before getting

into that physical altercation. Now

if it comes down to the physical
altercation we also go a step
beyond  to show you how to
escape serious bodily injury,”
Smith said. '

Vickie D’Ananzo, _a black belt
in Japanese-style karate, teaches
the classes with Smith.
D’Ananzo said the instructors take
the students" on the streets to
identify potential danger zones.
This approach is “unique to our
classes,” she said.

“We study people: Why is that
person a victim? If you were
going to attack someone, who
would you attack? The classes
teach you how to think like an
attacker,” she said. A

According to D’Ananzo,
women can avoid sexual assault
by taking control.

“A lot of women have-been
told, ‘Just, lay there.’ Turn the
wheels. Become the aggressor.
When they're no longer in charge,
the assault is over," she said.

Strange behavior canalso deter 9

assault,-she said. “You want the
attacker to think, ‘This person's

depth than, ‘you shouldn't walk
in unlit areas; you shouldn't walk

Mallamo said she still uses the
techniques she learned in Smith’s
classes. “It's not like I took the
class and then forgot everything."

Smith teaches his students how
to carry themselves to avoid
assault. “It helps your self-
conﬁdence, too, a simple thing
like walking down the street,”
Mallamo said. “The more energy
you have as you walk, the less of
a target you are."-

D’Ananzo said. she has been

Mentors ozssistﬂrstj/eozr students

By Catherine Goldstein
Sta_[f Writer

The advising sessions led by student mentors

’ “made it easier to understand what to expect”

from the University of Pittsburgh, said first-year
student Tom Gardner.

“I didn’t know anyone here at Pitt, so the
advising session made things easier for me. Since
there were only 10 or 12 students in my group,
I really got a chance to meet people,” Gardner

said.

Mentors administer placement tests, help with
registration, answer questions and distribute
information about the university, among other
things.

“I was a little nervous at first getting up in front
of a group of first-year students. They’re sort of
depending on you to guide them through those
few days,” said T om Kubilius, former student
coordinator and central staff member.

At the sessions the first-year students are taken
on tours of campus buildings. Afterward, some

V attend dances and movies sponsored by New

Student Programs.

“Last year during a dance, there was a girl who
was sitting alone, and another mentor and myself
approached her and tried to get her to meet other
people. She said, ‘I don’t want to meet anyone or
make any friends.’ This year I saw her, and she
looked really happy and well-adjusted, ” Kubilius
said. ’

There is also a Parents Program, coordinated
by central staff member Richard Geiger, which
gives the parents a chance to ask questions about
Pitt. ‘ »

According to Reid Sadler, a central staff member,
“They’ll ask, ‘So what’s the real story about drugs
and alcohol here?’ They also ask about things
like housing and roommates, the cafete_ria, safety

' issues like, ‘Is it safe to walk around Oakland day

or night?’ We try to be as honest and objective as
we can." . _ ’_
These sessions are run by 120 volunteer
mentors who are chosen and trained each winter. '
“I’ve learned a lot from it, and it's been a very
rewarding experience. It prepares you for

anything you wantto do later in life because you
have to make public presentations," Kubilius
said.

“One of the most rewarding aspects of being
a mentor is when someone comes up to you and
says, ‘I remember you; you were my mentor.’ It
makes you feel like you made a difference,” he
said.

The 10 central staff members, veterans of the
mentor program, set up the advising sessions in
the summer and contribute to the mentor-
selection process in the winter.

Unlike mentors, central staff members are
paid. A

The mentor-selection process consists of two
interviews, the first being a group project.

“Each group of new applicants has to complete
a task so we can see if they work well with
others. For example, they may have to think of

‘ an ad for an u comin event ” Kubilius said.
P ,

The second part of the process is a one-on-
one interview with either staff members or‘
veteran mentors who have_been mentors for a
summer and come back to ,contribute their
experiences to the program.

After about a month of interviews, a group
decision is made by the central staff, veteran
mentors, Brenda Pardini; the coordinator of new
student programs, and her assistant, Donna L.
Walker. “Between 70 and 75 new mentors are
chosen each year,” Walker said.

Afterx selections have been made, the new
mentors enroll in The University, a two-credit
training course about _Pitt’s history 4

“Different deparfrnents. come in and give
presentations on things like drugs and alcohol at '
Pitt and date rape. [The class] teaches you
enough about Pitt to be able to entertain questions
by the students‘and their parents,” Sadler said.

The next step of the training program is a
mock advising session, which lasts an entire
afternoon, where mentors gain practical
experience and can apply what they have learned.

“A lot of role-playing is involved to see how
the new mentors would deal with certain
situations” such as students abusing alcohol,
Kubilius said.

Cultura1—diversity program i

 

fights student stereotypes

By Catherine Goldstein

vSta_[7' Wﬁter

Last year a first-year student at
Pitt asked a mentor, “You’re really
Jewish? I thought they had horns
or something.” '

Comments like these caused
the Cultural Diversity program to
be developed. This two-year-old
program was designed to
introduce first-year students to
the diverse student body at Pitt,
according to Donna Walker,
assistant coordinator for new
student programs.

Attendance at cultural-diversity
programs is mandatory for all
first-year students who attend the
summer advising sessions.

The programs are open to all
students, and the meetings are
run by the 26 student facilitators
chosen by Brenda Pardini,
coordinator of New Student
Programs.

According to facilitator and
mentor Christine Bienkowsky, “A

part of our training were projects.
I remember during our mentor
class, Brenda Pardini came in
and said she wasn’t pleased with
our performance or attendance

‘ record, so only some of us had to

take a midterm, while others
didn't. »
"It turned out that she was just
trying to show us what it felt like
to be discriminated against, and
it definitely
Bienkowsky said. _

Although Cultural Diversity
operates out of the mentor office,
“we encourage anyone who is
interested to become involved
with the program,” said Tom
Kubilius, former student
coordinator.

The diversity meetings begin
with a film about students from
different backgrounds who are

involved in extracurricular  
 activities at Pitt. T

This is followed by two—hour

the stereotypes they already have
and to take an interest in someone
else’s ethnic background.

“At the last session, a freshman
came up to me and said, ‘Wow, I
never thought of it that way.’ So
if they're rethinking their
stereotypes and prejudices, we
know we’ve made a difference,

and they are more prepared to
deal with Pitt as a largely diverse
university.”

According to facilitator John
Lewis, “Each facilitator goes about
approaching their group
differently.

"For example, one guy wore
makeup and dressed up like a
girl, and another guy started out
by saying he was Jewish, even
though he wasn't. Different
people try different and creative
ways to get their group to start

talking about their views on
things," Lewis said.

"You have to understand,
everything is still very new and
experimental and changing all
the time,” he said.

Facilitators are trained for a
weekend in the spring, when

I they learn to deal with issues

such as overt racism,
homophobia and the
handicapped. Each facilitator
receives a $60 stipend for the
summer.

Pitt history professorauthority on slavery

By Laura Gallagher

Sta_ﬂ'Wrller

Pitt history Professor Seymour
Drescherhadhisﬁrst experience
with history during the Passover
Seder dimers of his childhood
"I learned about the beginning
of a people coming out of
slavery,” Drescher said

Retaining a deep respect for
his early religious experiences,
Drescher has made the study of
slavery and abolition his
vocation for the past 30 years.

A recent recipient of the
President's Distinguished
Research Award, he has focused
on the economics and sociology

of slavery in the Western world

Growing up learning about

Jewish history, Drescher began
to discover that there were
countless other histories and
civilizations about which to
learn.

‘I remember going to the
library and devouring histories,”
he said.

The phrase “because we were
slaves in Egypt” from the Seder
prayer still resonates the
strongest for Drescher.

“I learned that freedom did
not mean living happily ever
after.”

According to Van Hall, a
professor of American history at

Pitt, Drescher is “one of the
leading historians on slavery in
the world.”

He praised Drescher for his
recent award, testifying that it is
“difficult for a professor in the
social sciences to be recognized
for research, as precedence is
usually given to those in the
natural sciences.”

Drescher argues against the
theory that slavery ended
because it was economically
inefficient.

Giving the example of the
United States, he claims that
slavery was “a competitive and
expanding system." Slavery
ended because of the economic

changes following the Industrial
Revolution and the growth of
the British anti-slavery
movement

In addition to Drescher’s
extensive publishing on the
socioeconomic aspects of
slavery and abolition, he is
perhaps best—known for his
writings on the 19th-century
French abolitionist Alexis de
Tocqueville.

Drescher takes a comparative
approach to his research and
teaching.

“We may look at two or three
or four societies, seeing how
the people identify themselves,
how they look at the world, and

how they mobilize for action,”
Drescher said

Drescher originally came to
Pitt's history department “on the

p ground ﬂoor" in 1962 when the

university was undergoing an
enormous building process.
He was hired by the then
newly appointed department
head Sam Hays, who was
looking for “novice Ph.D.’s with
new and innovative‘
methodologies."

According to the recently

retired Hays, Drescher has been
an “outstanding leader in the
department and a mainstay of
our Western European
program.”

Pz’tt’s ‘honeymoon perzod’

Thousands of Pitt first-year students are enjoying their
newfound freedom, and acquaintance rape is the farthest
thing from their minds. But one in seven women in the
United States will be raped during the years they spend
at college.

The “honeymoon period” has ‘begun. As deﬁned in a
campus rape report by a group of Alpha Tau Omega
fraternity brothers at Syracuse University, the “honeymoon
period” refers to the beginning of a new school year,
“when freshman girls arrive on campus. They are so
. naive, especially ones from small towns or girls who have
never been away from home, who returned every night
to Mom and Dad. And the upperclassmen are there
waiting for them. They know how to manipulate the girls,
know what they can get away with, what they can say.”

Get-togethers in South Oakland and parties at fraternity
houses around campus contain all the necessary elements
for a typical acquaintance rape: men, women and alcohol.
Many sexual assaults are committed while the attacker is
under the inﬂuence of alcohol. .

Women in their first year at Pitt have suddenly been
thrust into an unknown world, one where their
‘surroundings are drastically unfamiliar and curfews are
non-existent. They also live in a, society which is

’ unsympathetic to women who have been sexuall
assaulted. ‘

A Time magazine poll revealed that 28 percent of

- people 18 to 35 think a woman “who dresses provocatively”
is partly to blame if she is raped. T hir’ty—four percent
thought a woman who consents to sex and then changes
her mind is at fault if she is raped. _

Although no woman is ever responsible for being
raped, the old stereotype that “she asked for it” is still
perpetuated. Blaming the victim is not an answer to the ,
problem. . "

More precautions need to be taken by the university, as
well as the students of Pitt, to deter date rape. Schools
across the country, encouraged by the voices of young
women who have come forward as victims of sexual
assaults, have begun intensive campus-rape awareness
programs. '

According to Time magazine, college men at Hobart
College at Geneva, N.Y., attend rape-prevention
workshops. As part of orientation, Pitt should follow the
lead of schools which have been scarred by episodes of
campus rape, and begin similar educational programs.

The University of Pittsburgh shouldn’t wait until
widespread instances of campus rape force the

' administration to take action.

Past action clouds Gates’ hearing

Being the conspiracy-theory lackey that I am, I
can't help but love yet truly despise President
George Bush’s nomination for Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, Robert Gates. ‘ Of
course, a guy who has more hands in covert
operations than Doc Octopus is nothing new in
Republican politics, but Gates seems to be tied to

yet he did nothing. This behavior seems to be
inherent in Gates. He has been linked to the 1980
Ronald Reagan presidential election that has come
under some heavy fire of late, as new allegations
are brought forth daily about the hostage-for-
presidency swap; a mind boggling criminal plan
that quite possibly could amount to the buying of

"every scandal that the bullied
press corps have been able to
squeeze out of the leaky (yet
always fixable in the great name
of National Security) White House.

This is actually Gates’ second

‘Brian
Berger

the presidency by the Reagan
camp.

There is evidence that Casey,
Gates and other Reagan aides
sold arms to the Ayatollah in
order to hold the American

nomination. In 1987 Gates , »
withdrew his name because of Senate concerns
over his role in the Iran—Contra scandal. Like all

' others involved, Gates cried wolf, or rather dumb, V

clueless wolf. During his first confirmation hearings,
Gates claimed that the allegations about diversion
of Iranian arms were sketchy, so he did not look
into them. Gates did testify that at a .1987 luncheon
between Gates, then CIA Director William Casey
and red, white and blue Oliver North, the colonel
made a “cryptic remark about Swiss bank accounts
and the Contras.” _ I A I
Thinking nothing of it, Gates disregarded the
statements, just as he withdrew warnings from CIA
national intelligence officer Charles Allen, then
Attorney General Edwin Meese and CIA Deputy
Director of Intelligence Richard Kerr. (Kerr
succeeded Gates.) Kerr testified that he told the CIA
deputy director (Gates) at the end of August of
1986, on suspicion from Allen, that he feared the

. United States had overcharged Iran for spare parts

on HAWK missiles and that money was being
diverted to the Contras. Gates testified that he
couldn’t remember the conversation. A
Gates did testify that he was approached by Allen
later .(in October of ’86) and confirmed Al1en’s
account, but he chose to play deaf.
“  My first reaction was to tell Mr. -Allen that I

didn’t want to hear any more about it— that I didn’t .

want to hear anything about funding for the
Contras," Gates testified to the panel.

So what are we to assume? A) He knew all along
and was in cahoots with the deals and put on his
dunce cap for the committee. B) He chose not to
know because he feared if it was leaked, he would
lose his job (or rock ‘em, sock ‘em Ollie would kick
his tail). C) Big bucks were being made off the deal,
and those in charge cared more about their own
material needs than they did about conducting
affairs of State in a legal fashion because they—are
in fact “above the law".

Let’s surrender and assume Gates was touched
by his “so help you God’? and told the truth to the
committee. What you've got is a man in a very
important position in government failing to do his

hostages in Iran until after the

1980 elections, thus insuring any laterally from

. President Carter and insuring the Reagan victory
.through brilliant, yet highly illegal and unethical,

completely immoral, damned—to-hell fascist politics.

Gates has also been accused of being involved
in the direct shipment of arms to Iraq that was done
without congressional consent and not only violates
a U.S. arms embargo of that nation but once again
violates U.S. law. The Reagan administration shipped

arms to Saddam’s regime in the mid—’80s as part of .

its “covert policy to tilt towards Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war.” As a chief CIA official Gates had

A direct involvement and knowledge of these deals.

The list goes on and on, from extending loan
credits to the Saddam (or was it Hitler) regime to
the newest charge that Gates was a direct player in
the mega-scandal surrounding the Bank Of Credit
arid Commerce International, which Time
magazine exposed as “the largest corporate criminal
enterprise ever, the most pervasive money-
laundering operation and financial supermarket
ever created for the likes of Manuel Noriega,
Ferdinand Marcos, Saddam Hussien and the
Colombian drug barons.”

Gates, as the CIA’s number-two man, had direct
dealings with all of these people. Ruthless. With
friends like these, all you have are enemies.

Gates’ nomination «is now in serious jeopardy
because of his involvement in everything that is
wrong with our government and the corrupt world
that revolves around it. Gates is a major mover in
our nation's affairs but only one in a large pond of
fish that are as dirty as the water they swim in.
Traditional beliefs in the Constitution and law no
longer seem to exist in our government, and it is
now acceptable to have a lawless government.

Gates probably won't get the nod," and that's a
great thing, but on the other hand the nomination
does require Senate confirmation, and that means
the microphones have to be turned on again. Only
problem is we know all the answers; I just can't
seem to remember them. \

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, August 29, 1991

Support for kids of alcoholics

Life is like. . . crazy circles
goin’ round and round.
One day you ’re up

5 and the next day you ‘re

‘ down... -Bad Company

I initially began this column
by trying to deﬁne and explain
the experiences of growing up
in a family with an alcoholic
parent. But after countless failed
beginnings (the story of my life),
I decided to wing it and let my
feelings about overcoming
denial and learning how to
recover from my past lead the
way. ‘

Recently, I began attending
an Adult Children of Alcoholics
(ACOA) support group because
my life seemed to be continually
heading down a dead-end
street. I felt broken. I'm not really
sure whatI mean, but I deﬁnitely
felt like some things needed to
be ﬁxed in my life. (Know the

feeling? Believe me, you’re not '

alone.) Feeling as if I were
defective in some way kept me
from enjoying‘ who I was and
keptgme from appreciating life.

After 26 years of living and
many attempts at trying to

change myself, I still felt like I ’
‘ was missing the point to life. I

tried so hard to fix the things in

,_ my life that weren’t normal, but

I didn’t know how to fix myself
because I didn’t know what
“normal” meant

In the past, I had used plenty
of dnigs, plenty, of alcohol and
plenty of sexual relationships
to capture some measure of
contentment with myself. All I

seemed to ﬁnd were a lot of
problems with the police, a lot

of hangovers and a lot of
dysfunctional relationships,
which caused me even greater
emotional torment. The lesson
I learned from my ventures:
Perhaps overindulgence isn’t
the healthiest way of achieving
inner peace, after all.

I also involved myself in
plenty of “healthy” attempts at
se1f—improvement. I turned into

Mike S
Hudson

an exercise ﬁend to cleansejmy
body. I enlisted in the Marine
Corps to add “discipline” to my
life, and I went to college to
enrich my mind. Once again, I
overindulged, became bored
and further frustrated myself
because self-fulfillment wasn’t
reached. Life still seemed so hard
for me.

So, celibate, sober and still’

discontent, I asked myself:
What's next? Suicide — too easy
and not an adequate solution.
Religion — not my style. I'm a

recovering Catholic, which also

can be addictive and
disillusioning. Professional
counseling —= too expensive.
Besides, the denial factor in me
still insisted, “I really don’t have
any majorproblems.”

Having internalized
practically everything that had
happened to me in my life, I
wasn’t able to talk with anyone
because I couldn't trust anyone.
As a protective device, I lived
by the credo: “You can never
get hurt by something you didn’t
say."

I went to an ACOA meeting
because people had been telling
me for years thatl was a textbook
example of an adult child of an
alcoholic. Sure, I read the list of
characteristics a thousand times
and thought, “What a crock of
shit. This is like a horoscope;
anyone can read this and see
something about themselves in
it.”

I was apprehensive ' and
ambivalent as I walked into my
first meeting. Would I be
expected to say, “Hi, my name's
Mike, and I’m a screw-up?”

To my surprise, the meeting
was a great experience. So was
the next one, and the next, and
the next.

Through the meetings, I was

able to see how destructive I
had been to myself. I am
learning to let go of the things
in my life that I have no control
over. The past cannot be
changed, there is no sense
dwelling over it.

The meetings have enabled
me to come to terms with
myself. I'm just beginning to
understand the full effects of
what had happened to me as a
child. Though I don't have total
recall of my childhood, I
remember situations that didn’t
seem too normal at the time
they were happening. But
what's a child supposed to
know about when he sees his
father passed out on the kitchen
floor? Or throwing up in the
backyard? Or yelling obsoenities
at the family?

From the support group, I’ve
learned that most of the things
I’d been blaming myself for, I
have never had control over.
I'm also learning about
accepting my problems and
recovering from a past that I
can never change.

Recovery (for me) is learning *

to forget the pain and
depression, the self pity and
the low selfesteem and working
toward a future, instead of
grieving over my past.

Now, I’m learning exactly

what I’ve always wanted but _

never been able to accomplish:

seizing the moment; Taking the .

time to appreciate that I’m alive.
I've stopped trying to, solve it
all; trying to create" answers to
questions that don’; really have
answers.

I don’t fully understand the
recovery process, but I know it
works. "

Recovery is a long, long road,

In the past, I thought that I was
a mess, but didn’t know what
to do about it. N ow I /enow that
I am a mess— but I am a mess
with potential.

informed students that only seven
percent of the bombs dropped
on Iraq were guided. The
remaining 93 percent were mostly
dropped from B-S2_s, from 40,000
feet, indiscriminately destroying

I the country. [...]. This is not what

the military was telling us during
the 43-day war. We were ﬁlled
with fantasies of 90-percent
success in targeting. Throughout
the war, U.S. military spokesmen
hailed our country’s technology,
its accuracy and precision,[...] by
keeping casualties to a complete
minimum. Furthermore, the
military and the media tried to
convince us that the [United States]
was only attempting to hit
“military” targets in Kuwait and
Iraq. My mind conjured up visions
of what a “rnilitary” target might
be: guns, ammunition, tanks,
planes, missiles, even military
personnel. Unfortunately the U.S.
military did_ not agree with this
assessment.

It is now evident that the
military, General Schwarzkopf,
Colin Powell, Dick Cheney and
George Bush deﬁned a “military”
target as the complete

_infrastructure of Iraq. Water

puriﬁcation facilities, electricity,
civil communications, bridges,
roads, civil transportation, food
storage, food production,
hospitals, pharmaceutical
facilities, schools and churches
were all fair game. At least the
U.S. embassy in Iraq was not

' damaged.

Not only is the technology to

the desire touse it arrogantly is
learned here as well. The nature
of academic study, especially in
the hard sciences, is usually
clinical and stiﬂing. The only
questions supposed to be asked

are those questions which are

are not supposed to ask, “But

True confessions of a procrastinating bohemian

After two years of juggling minimum-
wage jobs to support myself, I’ve decided
to go back to school.

It seemed like a good decision. I wasn’t
happy with the whole sleeping-on-

couches, drinking-myself-into-oblivion,

bohemian thing. I wasn’t going anywhere
or preparing any sort of future for myself.

I started missing school and took
enormous satisfaction in beating the red
tape to get back “in.”

I've become a little paranoid about
getting back “in” because doing so has
been such a struggle. '

I’d withdrawn from my last term two
years ago, but no one at any university

A ofﬁce would believe me. They seemed

adamantly determined to give me four Fs
—— and charge me for them. I had to talk
to about 20 different people in 20 different
ofﬁces before‘ someone ﬁnally would
accept that I had indeed withdrawn and
clear the debt from my record.

Tuesday found me rushing around
completing the ﬁnal steps to secure my
°‘in”—ness; -

‘In trying to register for classes (on the
last day of registration — old habits die

hard), my adviser informed ‘me that I'd!

have to trek over to Thackeray to pick up
some paperwork.

The dean's office sent me to the Ofﬁce
of Student Records, and at this point I was
feeling more like ‘a messenger than a
student.

At the Office of Student Records, the
guy in front of me in line discovered that
he hadn't actually graduated after all. It
seemed that he still had a two-credit math
requirement to fulﬁll, of which he was
unaware until trying to register for grad
school. '

Not only did his experience rob me of
some of my already ﬂeeting hope, but it
also stole a chunk of my quicldy dwindling
time. -

When I ﬁnally got back to my adviser,
there was a sign on his door saying he’d
be out until 2 p.m. — on the last day of
registration!!! ‘ H

When he returned, I watched in terror
as the two students ahead ofme became

hysterical, yelling, “Anything! Just give me
anything that's open!”

Fortunately for ‘me, I’ve fulﬁlled so few
requirements that when my time came,
“anything that was open” genuinely suited
me. This good luck was tainted, however,
by my adviserfs revelation that although
my debt had indeed been erased, the four
Fs remained on my transcript.

At this point I’m thinking, “To‘hell with
school; Colorado is where I really want to
be," the memory of several such terms
washing over me in "wave after nausiating
wave.

“What's wrong with ﬂipping burgers?” I
asked myself. I'd slept on couches, drank
myself into oblivion —— done the whole
bohemian thing. I’d had two years of total
freedom from responsibility. Could I justify
giving all that up to be herded mindlessly
from professor to adviser to unfeeling Pitt
bureaucrat? ’

This temporary breakdown was a very
tirne-consurning process, and all the while
I kept one eye on the clock just knowing
that the registration line would close the

It wasn’t a long wait (gotta love those

If you listen to Paul Hackett,
this weekend’s game against West
Virginia is a game of “major
proportions.”

Then again, what college coach
wouldn’t say just that_about an

opening game versus a traditional,

rival played in front of 63,500
rabid fans? The thing is: Hackett is
probably correct in his assessment.
After last year’s 3-7-1 record and
the 38-24 WVU win at Pitt Stadium,
the Panthers really need this game.

“An added signiﬁcance in this
game is what happened last year, ”
Hackett said. “What happened
here last year was dramatic. It is
our single motivating factor for
this week.” '

What happened last year was a
massive offensive display by the
Mountaineers: 547 yards total,
including 378 yards on the ground.
Of course, not all of it was their

. doing. The Pitt defense was

continually chasing the speedy
tailbacks, especially Michael
Beasley. Beasley, who ran for 197
yards in that game, has been
switched to flanker by West
Virginia coach Don Nehlen

Everything seems to point to ‘

the Houston Oilers finally
winning the AFC Central Division.

Season-opening ‘Brawl

because of a glut at tailback and
the loss of last year's ﬂanker.

Speed is a primary concern for
Pitt. Split end James Jett is an All-
American sprinter, and speed
abounds in the backﬁeld and the
defensive secondary.
Quarterback Darren Studstill will
run the option, making him a
ground threat as well.

“Studstill is a swift guy, like
[Syracuse quarterback Marvin]
Graves,” said linebacker Ricardo

McDonald, “so we’ll have _to play J .

our positions, keep . our
responsibilities.” "'

On offense, the Panthers must
establish themselves in order to
offset the crowd and home-ﬁeld
factors.

“The hostile environment is a
huge advantage for West
Virginia,” Hackett said. “We must
rely on on-the—fieId leadership to
get us through the early part of
the season.”

West Virginia returns talent at
linebacker, including senior Steve
Grant, but the interior line is thin
and "inexperienced, having only
one senior. The secondary,
however, is deep and
experienced, with safeties Mike
Collins and Darrell Whitrnore and

Warren Moon will rectify that
problem this year. The receiving
corps is loaded with weapons
like Drew Hill, Ernest Givins,

“When you combine the
atmosphere and the youth we
have, it creates a problem,”
Hackett said.

Of course, both teams will be
geared up to play, and a national
television audience will be
watching. Those two factors will
also contribute to the amount of
mistakes by the players, not to
mention;-the matter of bragging

“There’s no doubt what kind of
game this will be,” said Van Pelt.
“It’s going to be a put-on—the-

J While everyone remembers
Van Pelt’s successes at West
Virginia, it should be noted that

' Pitt hasn't won a road game since

the Rutgers game in Ireland in
1989, and this first game will go
a long way in deciding the
fortunes of both teams.

“It would be better to play Pitt

protection. The Oilers have one
that is ably mannedby Mike
Munchak, Bruce Matthews, David
Williams, Don Maggs and Dean
Steinkuhler.

Defensively, this is the best
Oiler squad since 1980. The recent
acquisition of defensive end Lee
Williams from the Chargers was a
brilliant move. He will face fewer
double-teams in the Oiler 4-5
defense, so look for Williams to
be among the conference leaders
in sacks. Defensive tackles Ray
Childress and Doug Smith and

‘defensive end William Fuller

ound out a formidable defensive
front. Linebacker Lamar Lathon
should produce more in his
sophomore season. Rookie Mike
Dumas will pair with Bubba
McDowell to make, the Oilers
strong up the middle. (10-6, ﬁnally
winning this division.)

The Pittsburgh Steelers win
with defense, and this year’s group
looks outstanding once again.
Pro—Bowlers cornerback Rod
Woodson and inside linebacker
David Little have finally signed to
lead the NFL’s No. 1 defensive
unit from. a year ago. The
secondary is peerless with
Woodson, CB David Johnson,
strong safety Carnell Lake and
free safety Thomas Everett.

Number-one pick Huey
Richardson should make an
impact this year. The 6-foot 5-
inch, 233—pound LB/DE could be
the Steelers’ Karl Mecklenburg,
causing havoc by lining up at
different positions all the time.
LBs Little, Hardy Nickerson and
Bryan l-Iinkle are solid, steady
defenders. OLB Greg Lloyd is the
tenacious,‘  leader of
the defense.

Nose tackle Gerald Williams is
the Steelers’ most consistent
lineman. Chuck Noll hopes that
defensive ends Aaron Jones and
Kenny Davidson come on strong
and play to their potential. Look
for the Steelers to use the 4-5
even more this season.

Bubby Brister will lead the
Steeler offense to a touchdown
before the ﬁfth game this season.
Brister is in the last year of his
contract, so a good year could
see him sign one of those big QB
contracts. This will be Barry
Fosters year. He explodes u pﬁeld,
running north and south as
opposed to oft-injured Tim
,Worley, who runs east and west
too much, looking for daylight.
Tight end Eric Green is going to
return glory to his position that
has not been there since Kellen

Winslow was in his heyday with

the Chargers.

The Steelers are trying to get
bigger up front by putting Torn
Ricketts at left guard and Carlton
Haselrig at right guard. Center
Dermontti Dawson should earn a
Pro Bowl berth. John Jackson
and Tunch Ilkin are reliable
tackles. Even thou gh, they signed
late, rookie receiversJeff Graham
and Ernie Mills should help Louis
Lipps, who runs the best out
patterns in the game. Having a
kicker like Gary Anderson will

always make the Steelers a threat

in close games. (9-7, with a
wildcard appearance.)

Steelers-Chargers likely a low—scoring, error-filled game

By Brian Berger and

Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

MCs Peanut Butter and Jelly
spread our licks with a power
play of the ruthless NFC East
Division as we lay down the law

for Week One of the NFL season. ‘

This division shall reign supreme
once again, and expect three of
the four contenders to come out
firing.

But before we hit with our
picks of the week, let’s check in
with Chuck Noll’s boys.

-San Diego Chargers at

Pittsburgh Steelers (-5).

The Steelers open the '91 slate
against a Charger team that has a
water—pistol offense, led by
quarterback John Friesz, who
somehow beat out three other
stiffs in camp. There is some
talent at skill positions. Wideout
Anthony Miller from Tennessee
is a burner who hauled in 63
passes and seven TDs a year ago.
The big butt of training camp,
running back Marion Butts,
reported to camp on Monday but
will only see limited action. So
look for Rod Bernstine or rookie
Eric Bieniemy to handle most of

the running chores in a low-risk
offense that wouldn’t even fool
our perspective editor.

On defense look for the
Chargers’ frontline to give Bubby
Brister a lot of problems. The
Chargers ranked third in the AFC
in total defense last season and

first against the run. But let’s not >

forget that the Steelers blew out
the Chargers 36-14 last year, as
Joe Walton’s offense clocked its
first touchdown of the season.
Our guess here is that both
offenses are still in the fetus stage,
while both defenses are more
than ready. In what should be a

low—scoring, turnover-filled, non-
quarterback game, we’ll take the
nuggets. Take San Diego +5.
I Lets get out of the unripened
fruit aisle and into the meat section:
-Dallas Cowboys (-2) at
Cleveland Browns
In Cleveland there are heavy
expectations for new coach Bill
Belichick. The man who coached
the New York Giants’ defense to
two world championships brings
a tireless work ethic and youthful
enthusiasm at the young age of
39. Unfortunately it seems that
Belichick could be the youngest
figure in the Browns’ organization.

Cleveland picked up antiquei
running backs Joe Morris and Lee’
Rousson to go along ‘with their

ancient offensive line, which is»

about as quick as Mt. Rushmore
these days. That spells more bad.
news for overrated sidearm-
slinger Bernie‘Kosar. Kosar threw
15 interceptions against only 10
touchdowns a year ago and
finished with a pathetic
quarterback rating of 65.7. Only
Marc Wilson of the Patriots had a
lower rating. The line was so bad
that the Brownies went the plan-

front seven. Last year’s No. 1 pick
LBJames Francis had a big rookie
campaign, and expectations for
this year’s No. 1 LB Alfred
Williams, may be unrealistic.
Nose tackle Tim Krumrie has
been unable to regain his pre-
injury form. Defensive lineman
David Grant is an underachiever.
Defensive linemen Lamar Rogers
and Bob Dahl were high'draft
picks this year, but rookie linemen

seldom offer more than situational:

pass rushing. The strength of the
Bengal D is its secondary, led by
linebacker  er, safety David
Fulcher. There is depth at corner
with Eric Thomas‘, Rod Jones,
Lewis Billups and Rickey Dixon.
Fullback Ickey Woods will not
start the year due to injury, but he
will do some shuffling before the
season is over. Ageless halfback
James Brooks actually is running
faster forties than ever. He is also
a dangerous receiver. Hall of
Fame left tackle Anthony Munoz
leads a mammoth offensive line
that can run-and-pass block with
equal precision when healthy.
Esiason needs to find his big-
play receivers more. Wideouts
Eddie Brown and Tim McGee
andtight end Rodney Holman
can be a game—breaking trio.
Second-year~ receiver Reggie
Rembert could be especially

effective in the red zone on fade
patterns. (8-8, as teams keep the
Bengal O off the field by running
the ball.)

It appears as though owner Art

Modell has made a good choice
in making Bill Belichick head
coach of the Cleveland Browns.
Belichick will emphasize power
football. on both offense — and

defense. His major task this year

will be to patch up an awful
offensive line so that immobile
QB Bernie Kosar does not spend
the season on his back. RBs Kevin
Mack and Joe Morris can gain
some yardage if they get some
blocking. Eric Metcalf could be
one of the most deadly weapons

in the league if properly used. .

Nobody is better in the open ﬁeld
than Metcalf. WRs Webster
Slaughter and Reggie “Foghorn”
Langhorne’s names are " bigger
than their performances. Sixth-
round wide receiver Michael
“Thriller” Jackson could be a
find. '

Belichick will employ both 4-5
and 3-4 defensive schemes. They
will gamble less until theyupgrade
their talent.Just-signed defensive
tackle Michael Dean Perry is a
terror that no team. can single
block.. LBS Clay Matthews and
Mike Johnson, and CB Frank
Minniﬁeld will be around to help
integrate the younger players.

in week 15, Dallas probably
would have made the playoffs.
Ernrnitt Smith is pure dynamite.
Coming off a sensational rookie

year, Smith should be even-

stronger this time around, now
that he has a full training camp
under his belt and two solid
backups in Pitt’s own Curvin
Richards and WLAFveteran Ricky
Blake. Smith was worn out

rookie burner Alvin Harper to

contribute big things

immediately. Jay Novacek is very
underrated but an integral part
of the Dallas attack. The offensive .
line is still very suspect and will
most likely cost the Cowboys a
game or two.

always been the bettors’ bread
‘n’ butter, but throw that out with
a sorry Cleveland outfit that was

‘ a despicable 0-4-1 versus the

spread as a home ‘dog last season
and has not improved much,
particularly at the skill positions.

Our hunch is that the Brownies
have a legitimate shot at being a
home ‘dog in all eight home
games this year. Dallas is a team
on the rise, not yet among the
league's elite, ‘but they're still
way too much for Cleveland.

Erik Kramer. These two made
running an offense look as
complicatedas brain surgery. New
offensive coordinator Dave Levy
gets the unenviable task of _
ﬁguring out how to get the NFL’s
best back, Barry Sanders, more
involved. This means look for
Sanders more out in the ﬂats, but
whether they actually get the ball
to him could determine the Lions’
fate. Another key figure could be

‘rookie wideout Reggie Barrett

from UTEP. Both Moore and
Barrett are big, fast receivers with
excellent leaping ability and
should stretch defenses to the
limit. The offensive line is not

_ spectacular, but it’s solid.

Only two defenses surrendered
more points than the Lions’: the
hapless Patriots and the Browns.
However, this can be traced more
to the misfortune of injuries rather
than a lack of talent. Free safety
Bennie Blades and linebacker
Chris Spielman both missed four
games due to injuries, and tackle

Marc Spindler had earned a 

starting job until a knee injury
ended his season in the third
game. With all of these players
healthy again and rookie end
Kelvin Pritchett ready to step in,
the Lions should improve
substantially. But Detroit is still
counting on the offense to carry
them into the playoffs, and we
don’t feel that the young talent is
going to gel just yet.
The‘Washington Redskins are
once again ready to knock heads
with New York’s Giants and

Philly’s Eagles in the NFL’s most g 

powerful division. The ‘Skins
should have been playing in the
NFC Championship last year, but
two untimely interceptions in the
San Francisco end zone by QB
Mark Rypien and a blown pass-
interferenoe call allowed the ’49ers
to sneak by once again. Now the
‘Skins look more powerful and
focused than ever.
On offense, a healthy Rypien

gets the opportunity to prove all _ t
the skeptics wrong. With ‘5’

workhorse Earnest Byner lugging
the pigskin and the mammoth
offensive line punishing
defenders, Rypien should be able
to relax and have a solid season.
Solid is all he’ll need because the
receiving corps is still the best in
football. Gary Clark, Art Monk
and Ricky Sanders combined for
199 receptions, 2,609 yards and
16 touchdowns. If Rypien

eliminates the mistakes, the ‘Skins V’

will be rolling up thescore.

The defense has a plethora of
new faces, but the results should
be the same; not much yardage

Picks

Continued from page 12
Williams and Tim Johnson were
acquired last season and proved
to be smashing successes.
Discontented Wilber Marshall
needs to have a big season at
linebacker, while veteran Matt
Millen brings more toughness to
a team already meaner than
south—central Los Angeles. Andre
Collins surprised everyone last
year and appears to be the heir
apparent to Marshall as the
dominant linebacker in D.C. The
secondary looked extremely
vulnerable at times last season,
but veterans Darrell Green and
Alvin Walton always held this
unit together.

Too bad for Lion defenders
that this game won’t be played
under the roof of the Silverdome,
because there will be severe
damages inﬂicted in a Rypien

aerial bombardment Look for I

the riddle—fi1led Lion secondary
to be toasted by “the Posse.” The
‘Skins were a solid S-2 versus the
spread as a home favorite last
season. RFK will be rockin’ again.
In a legitimate blowout, take
Washington - 7 1/2.

-Philadelphia Eagles (-1 1/2)
at Green Bay Packers.

Green Bay enters the season

with a very big problem: no Tim —

Harris. Harris is the Packer
defense; it’s that simple. He is
currently holding out in a salary
dispute, which leaves the Packers
in trouble. They ranked 27th in

sacks last year and, minus Harris,
have no pass-rush to speak of. To
complicate matters even further,
the secondary is growing older
and slower with no impact players
on the horizon.

On the bright side, quarterback
Don Majikowski could be ready
to return to the Pro Bowl after
suffering through a holdout and
injuries last season. A sharp
Majikowski makes the Packers a
threat against almost any team in
the league. ’

Sterling Sharpe had another
Pro—bowl season with 67
receptions for 1,105 yards and 6
TDs despite playing the second
half of the year with cracked ribs.
Combined with Perry Kemp and
Jeff Query, the Pack has a
formidable receiving crew. The
hope is that Darrell Thompson or

rookie Chuck Webb will become
the “go-to man” in the backﬁeld,
but Webb is currently on injured
reserve, so it will be all Majik.

In Philly the Eagles face major
holdout problems of their own.
Pro—bowl defensive tackleJerome
Brown and star defenders ‘Seth
Joyner and Clyde Simmons
remain unsigned as the season
inches closer. Obviously the
weight falls squarely on the
shoulders of the NFL’s 1990 Most
Valuable Player, Randall
Cunningham, and his high—octane
offense.

Rich Kotite’s crew looked
impressive in the pre-season, as
the first team offense scored on
close to 70 percent of its drives.
Cunningham has perennial all-
pro Keith Jackson primed for his
best ‘season yet. The versatile

Keith Byars snagged 81 passes
last season and displayed some
punishing blocking. The ﬂashy
sophomore tandem of Calvin
Williams and “Arkansas” Fred
Barnett should only get better
with experiece at the wideout
slot The offensive line had been
the weak point of this team the

_ past few seasons, but the addition

of 327-pound tackle Antone Davis
from Tennessee should make life
easier for Eagle backs.

The defense will not be its
headhunting self for a while. Even
if the holdouts should report soon,
it will be a couple of weeks
before they are hitting on all
cylinders. For now all-pro
defensive end Reggie White and
MLB Byron Evans will have to
play very big for this club. Without
the devastating pass-rush that the

Birds are known for, the

secondary will have to step up

and make the plays.
They are loaded with talent but
in years past often fell victim to

ex—Coach Buddy Ryan’s reckless, ,
gambling scheme which left them _
out to dry. Cornermen Eric Allen _

and Ben Smith have exceptional
speed, while safeties Wes
Hopkins and Andre Waters love
to hit people.

The Pack ain't back but will be
on their back as the multi-faceted
Eagle offense cashes in on a_
Packer defense that is weak and
depleted minus their only true
force in Harris. Our guess is that
Cunningham is a good bet to take
NFC Player of the Week honors.
Cash your checks. Giant Eagle
rout. In our pick of the week,
take Philly -1 1/2.

Military beats provide  
Metallica withan ‘edge’

Metallica
Metallica
Elektra

It’s been a little over three
years since Metallica released 
And Justice For All. Has it been
worth the wait for their new
album? Yes it has.

This is their best album since
either Ride the Lightning or
Master of Puppets (It’s hard to
choose which one is better). This
album has none of the nine-
minute epics like justice and no
instrumental pieces, but it is a
stand-out album.

Rumors have been ﬂoating
around that lead guitarist Kirk
Hammett has been in rehab, but
Metallica’s management will not
comment on this statement. His
guitar work does not seem as
intricate and involved as before
but is still very well done. Make
what you will of that.

James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich
give the same great in—your-face
performances that people have
come to expect of them. And
bassistJason Newsted has finally

exorcised Cliff Burton’s ghost and -

is playing the bass his way instead
of trying to be a new Cliff.

The whole album has a kind of
military—marching beat to it. Some
people might be turned off by
this, but I feel that it gives the
album a different edge and shows
that the band is not as-one-sided
as some people think they are.

Four songs really stand out on
this album. Hetfield’s vocal
abilities really shine in “The
Unforgiven.” “The God That
Failed” has bits and pieces of
harmonizing throughout, and
Ulrich is pounding on his drums
for a good hard-and-heavy beat.
“My Friend of Misery” is another
song that really appealed to me,
but it is hard to describe why. Just
listen, and I think you’ll agree.

' “Struggle Within” is the last song

on the album and probably the
best song on the whole thing.
Ulrich opens with a killer military
beat, and then the song busts into
a great thrash song.

Some people might argue that
Metallica is trying to get radio
play because none of these songs
seem really controversial, but I
don’t think they are. Can’t they

If you like Metallica or metal
music, then this album is a must. -
If you don’t, buy it anyway just
because it is damn good. A 10 out

Bluesiana II
Bluesicma II
Windham Hill Jazz

Last year, Windham Hill’s jazz
label released an unusual
recording called Bluesiana
Triangle, which featured
saxophonist David “Fathead”
Newman, pianist Dr. John and

the late Art Blakey on drums.‘

The album was the product of a
jam session which testified to
Blakey’s roots in the blues and to
theﬂcomplemerrtary jazz and blues
styles of Newman and Dr. John.

The follow-up to that date is
Bluesianlkz II, which expands on
the number of musicians in trying
to make up for the loss of Blakey.
Dr. John, Newman, bassist Essiet
O. Essiet and percussionist Joe
Bonadio all return from the first
album, and joining them are
trombonist Ray Anderson, bassist

‘ Jay Leonhart and Living Colour

drummer Will Calhoun.

This release is a combination
tribute to Blakey and a showcase
for Anderson and Calhoun. Dr.

 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

John wrote six of the 10 songs,
but Anderson’s playing is what
stands out.‘ He has long been
known as a scruffy, sarcastic kind
of player, and that style fits in
perfectly with the upbeat tunes:
“Fonkalishus,” “Doctor Blooze”
and “Skoshuss.”

Anderson’s signature squeals,
slurs and stutters on the
instrument give the songs a free-
wheeling element which makes
them very enjoyable. But
Anderson also comes across as a
skillful technician in “For Art’s
Sake,” playing with a warm_style
that very few ‘bone players
approach.

Although a Texas native,
Newman didn’t really embrace
the blues as a young artist but
became a prominent figure as a
member of 'Ray Charles’ band
throughout the 19505. “Fathead”
provides soulful solo work but is
at his best when complementing
a piano, which he did for Charles
for a decade. He also turns in a
nice performance on ﬂute in his
song, “Montana Banana.” Not an

impressively on vocals. He has a  , -:

Dr. John (his actual name is,-

Mac Rebennack) is a New Orleans
blues player who contributes on
guitar and most

of scratchiness and the ability to"
bend his notes to produce the
right effect. Dr. John's piano
playing isn’t the most original,

but again, he is a fine complement j

to the other musicians.

The influence of Blakey isn’t
forgotten on this album, however.
Essiet was a former Jazz
Messenger under the legendary
drummer, and there are two
tribute songs here. Calhoun and
Bonadio provide steady rhythm
work, especially on a Latin piece
titled “Santa Rosalia.” Calhoun

offers a seven—minute drum solo, A

‘.‘Tribute to Art,” to round out the

album. The Berklee College of I
Music grad displays his jazz talents I _
throughout, evoking memories.

Star Trek VI.- Tbe Undiscovered Country is being 
billed as the final adventure of the fearless crew

Director Nicholas Meyer has also assembled

Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino tackle middle-

Compilation
Planet X Records

Yet another collection of rare
tracks from mainly eastern and
rnidwestern U.S.— teen ’60s bands
heavily influenced by their
English counterparts make an
appearance on the Psychotic
Reactions Compilation.

The first tune is “I’m a Man” by
the Buckinghams (“Kind of Drag”
fame) , and there’s no doubt
those guys listened to a few
Yardbirds records. It’s a great
version of the song and was

second song is The Who’s “Can’t
Explain” played true—to—form by
New England's The Ones.

Another Yardbirds-influenced
tune comes next, by New York’s
The Mark IV. “I Don’t Want Your
Lovin” raves it up with incredible
bass lines and fuzzed—out
screaming guitar leads.

The next track is "You’re Gonna
Break My Heart” by the Abstrak
Sound, which sounds more surf-
oriented with loads of
reverberated guitar.

Ohio’s The Jagger's “Feel So
Good” borrows the Kinks’ “All
Day and All of the Night” riff for
a rockin’ little number.

A scorching fuzz guitar/harp-
wailin’/organ-grinding pounder,
“Lovin’ Season" by the Myddle
Class, is by far the strongest son
on side one. -

The Magicians (“An Invitation
to Cry” fame) round off side one
with “Lady Fingers” —— a really
haunting psychedelic song, which
is typical Magicians.

Two Beatle-ish type songs start
the second side. The Distant
Cousins’ “Let it Ring” has a folk/
pop ﬂavor , and The New Order’s
“You've Got Me High” sounds
like it could have been a big hit
if pushed harder by promotional
