TO MEET MONDAY

 

A special meeting of Alumni Coun-
cil will be held at the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association Monday evening,
November 12th, and all members are
urged to attend. Following the cus-
tom adopted‘ for regular meetings,
dinner will be served at _6_P. M. and
the business meeting will follow.‘ A
question of vital importance toﬂthe
University will be presented at this
meeting. Chancellor McCormick and
members of the Board of Trustees
will beinvited toattend. _

Notices have ‘been sent from the

The defeat of Benn State gave» the
VV. & J. crowd supreme conﬁdence
and with such stars as Henry Mc-
Creight, V\/imberly, Brown," Stobbs
and other luminaries in the lineup,
they -cannot see where Pitt will win.

"On the other hand, the Un_iversity
rooters‘h~ave supreme conﬁdence in
Coach “P_op” \Varner, Capt. Cliff
Carlson, George McLaren, -and ‘the
entire varsity crowd " -to “come
through.” Everyone believes that the
poor game’ played at Penn was just
the proper tonic needed to put the
varsity on edgefor the W. &.J.
game. ‘Every player,will enter the
game. keyed up to the highest pitch
and with a ﬁne assortment of Warner
plays, twhich have been devised es-
pecially for W. & J., it is believed
that the Red and Black will .be van-

"for the game. Several cripples were

held out of the Westminster game
with the idea of getting them in shape
for W. & J. This gagne, by the way,
was merely a practice affair for Capt.
Carlson’s men. Alumni shouldn't get
vgorried over the 25-0 score. Substi-
tutes played the most part of the
game. ‘If Warner had wanted 100
points he could have kept the varsity
in and accomplished the trick. I

' Just one ﬁnal word, Alumni. The

W. & J. game this year ‘is a REAL’

TEST for the varsity. Pitt isn't go-
ing_to win without a hard battle. W.
&.J. is stronger‘ than ever and Pitt
isn't as strong as last year. Spirit
and support; of the team will help win
the game. Come to the game pre-
pared to ROOT HARD AND LONG.
That's what inspires the team to ﬁght.
Through some ‘psychologica? phe-
