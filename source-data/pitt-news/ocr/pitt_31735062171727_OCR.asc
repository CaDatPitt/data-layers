Lawson, Committee

Plan Housing Board  

by CINDY MORGAN
Committees Commissioner

 Wade Lawson and a special com-

mittee met Thursday to discuss
off-campus housing problems.
Their primary goal will be to es-
tablish an off-campus housing or-
ganization which will publish a
housing brochure and develop a
review board to make students
aware of their rights as tenants.

After this committee organizes
complaint information and sur-
veys the housing in the immedi-
ate Oakland area the data will be
compiled into a brochure and dis-
tributed to all students. The
brochure will include the Rent
Withholding Act and how it ‘ap-
plies to the student and will
strongly suggest housing for stu-

 C dents.

Lawson commented, “Oakland
is a low—income area with a very
high rent scale. Because of the
student supply and demand, stu-
dents are exploited because they
are students.”

“The best way to deal with a
landlord is through economics and
rent withholding. If a student

rents a place which he finds unsa_t- -

isfactory, he can call the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare to inspect the premises.

“If it is unsafe or unhealthy, the
landlord will be faced with an
ultimatum. He can either fix it
up or have the rent put in escrow,
a separate bank account in which
the student deposits his rents, but
which can’t be touched by the
landlord until the necessary
changes are made.

“At the same time, he can’t

, rent to anyone else and is losing

hundreds of dollars in rent each
month.”

The committee will eventually
expand itself to involve landlords
in the immediate area, forming a
tenant-landlord association. This
will give the organization input on
both sides of the problem and also‘
give it more power.

Lawson is requesting that the
University look into this.issue as
a University problem, rather than
just a student problem.

He will also request that a re-
view board be created in conjunc-
tion with the off-campus housing

A committee.

T’, This review board should in-
clude as permanent members:
two trustees from the Trustees
Student Affairs Committee, one
member from the Housing Office,
two landlords from the Oakland
area, two students housed off-
campus, the‘ Committees Com-
missioner from the Student Asso-
ciation, two members from the
University Senate Council and
two members from the Black Ac-
tion Society.

The headline covering the
Job Placement Center story on
page one of Friday's Pitt News,
“Job Outlook Optimistic,” mis-
represented the intent of the
article.

Although Ernest Holmok, di-
rector of the Placement Cen-
ter, views the job market op-

are scarce at present.

Their immediate responsibility
would be to hear complaints in-
volving discrimination, unfit hous-
ing, and illegal leases. '

This group would also make
specific recommendations to the
Chancellor and work closely with
the Human Relations Bureau, the
Alliance for Consumer Protection
and the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.

“This board will be important,”
Lawson asserted, “because form-
erly it took too much time, often
up to two years, for a student to
get results after he filed a com-
plaint with the Human Relations
Board.”

State Aid At Issue

tebruary 8, 1971

Students, Legislators Confer‘

by POHLA SMITH

Student Association leaders
traveled to Harrisburg Thursday
to meet with state legislators and
administrative assistants.

Dennis Concilla, Programs
Commissioner, and Lynn Alstadt,
Special Programs coordinator,
discussed with legislators the fu-
ture of state aid to the University
and also uncovered various»opin—
ions that representatives have of
Pitt and college students.

They also spoke with state con- '

gressional leaders about Gover-
nor Shapp's proposed tax pro-
gram.

The tax package includes a five
per cent income tax and a reduc-
tion of various sales,taxes. The
tax would provide the Common-
wealth with $1.5 billion in tax
revenue. Approximately $455 mil-
lion of this is needed to meet cur-
rent expenses.

A spokesman for the Governor
told the two students that he was
optimistic the. bill would pass the
House when it comes to a vote
Wednesday.

A minority leader, however,
told the Student Government offi-
cials that he thinks it unlikely the
bill will pass in the House where

it will first come up for a vote.

The bill faces additional opposi-

tion if it passes on to the Senate.
One criticism of the new tax bill

is that it will raise $1 billion in

unrequested revenue. Minority
leaders prefer a two per cent in-
come tax which would_raise only
$500 million, the amount needed
to pay current bills.

In a recent speech Shapp ex-
plained that the extra money
would give him a broad base for
current programs and give him
room to “turn the state financial
situation around.”

Most legislators revealed to
Concilla and Alstadt there desires
of avoiding a repeat of last year’s
financial crisis, but some do not
want to unnecessarily burden
their constituencies with an in-
come tax.

State leaders are encouraging
all state aid recipients to review
their budgets and seek more eco-
nomic and efficient programs.

The student leaders reported
that Pitt is facing a possible sec-
ond financial crisis. They urge
students and taxpayers to write
their representatives and argue
for passage of the tax bill that
will prevent another budgetary
crisis. ‘

Concilla and Alstadt also met
with John Pittinger, the Gover-
nor’s legislative secretary, and
student representatives from
Penn State, Temple University,
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania. They discussed formation
of a Student Educational Lobby in
the state capitol.

Swami Preaches Divine °Link-up’
Through Krishna Cosciousness

by TOM HEIPLE

Sitting on the podium in the 10-
tus position in Heinz Chapel, Kir-
tanananda Swami lectured K on
yoga of the supreme person and
its relationship to Krishna consci-
ousness.

Speaking to approximately 75
inquisitive and skeptical people,
the Swami defined yoga as “the
process by which a fragmented or
material conscience becomes
again a part of the supreme con-
sciousness, Krishna Conscious-
ness.” He added that Yoga liter-
ally means “to link up. “Krish-
na Consciousness,” he continued,
“is realizing we are all part and
parcel of the same person.”

He compared the ultimate goal
of linking up to a light and electric
current. Unless the plug makes
contact there can be no light. By
the same token, unless a person
actually links up with Krishna, or
God while practicing yoga, there
can be no consciousness.

The Swami contrasted the two
great systems of yoga, the per-
sonal and the impersonal.

The personal form involves
three varying stages of deep med-
itation to the Supreme Being dur-
ing yoga.

Because there is no memory or
experience of being disembodied
spiritually, the impersonal form
is, according to the Swami, much
more demanding. To use it suc-
cessfully, he said, you must con-
trol all the senses, the amount of

 

Kirtanananda Swami and several disciples of Kirshna.

sleep you get,. remain celibate
and a vegetarian, and be equally
disposed toward everyone. You
must also know the Sanskrit lan-
guage and live in a secluded place.
Eventually you will converge at a
point—Krishna.

Quoting from the Bhagaval-gita
as It Is, the Swami said, “One
will reach me (Krishna) in either
case. He who worships me is the
greatest of all yogis.”

Continuing, the Swami declar-
ed that Krishna is the totality of
everything, complete and perfect
in every respect, whose body nev-
er deteriorates and constantly ap-
pears and reappears through eter-
nity. He can do anything with any
sense.

“We are all trying to be God,”
he said. “People think of yoga of
the supreme person to mean you
and me. The supreme person
means the original person.

“This movement is no ordinary
movement,” heargued. “There is
the possibilitity in this movement
of saving the world through Krish-
na Consciousness.”

The world, he said, is large

because of inadequate planning
that is being missued. Krishna Con-
sciousness intends to reverse that

The proposed lobby would be
housed in a permanent office and
staffed with professional people.
Interested students would also re-
ceive academic credit for working
in the lobbv.

“The lobby would act as an om-
budsman between the students
and the state government,” said
the Program Commissioner. The
lobby would also be a body to
which legislators could voice their
complaints against students.”

Student representatives from
all of Pennsylvania’s colleges
and universities are shceduled to
meet at Penn State March 5-8 to
design the lobby which will allow
students to try to influence pro-
posed legislation affecting stu-
dents.

Apathy Holds L  
Security Back,

Merritt Says

by CAROLE COVAL

Although 24 men have been add-
ed to the Campus Police force
since June of 1970. Superinten-
dent Robert Merritt said, “Secur-
ity cannot come from merely mul-
tiplying the staff. It comes from
students themselves wanting se-
curity.

“It is obvious,” he said, “that

‘ student apathy is one of the great-

est hindrances to security.”

Merritt urges all students to
share in the responsibilities that
security involves. “Students

should call University Police and .

report strangers wandering
around,”he said. _

“We areprepared to provide se-

curity,” he said, “but the question

is how much and where?”

John Vrana, director of Univer-
sity Housing, is acting upon a sug-
gestion from the Residence Hall
Advisory Board. In a meeting with
Vrana Thursday night, the Board
suggested that a referendum be
taken of student opinion concern-
ing security measures.

Vrana stated that he received
many calls from students about

the hours for ID check in the Tow- '

   

 

l

ers. “I received various opinions '

of the new hours,” he said. “Some

students felt that the hours were i

either too long or too lenient.

Students are urged to reply /to I

the referendum, so that Housing
and Security can meet the individ-
ual dorm security needs.

The hit Israeli singer, Gadi
Elon, was the star attraction of
Israeli Day, held in the Student
Union Ballroom on Jan. 27.

The day’s cultural activities
brought the flavor of Israel
to more than 2,000 students, fac-
ulty and members of the commun-
ity. Other features of the day in-
cluded Israeli dancing and music,
short subjects and slides on life
in Israel and the spicy Middle
Eastern food, felafel.

The day started at 10 am., with
Israeli music that continued
throughout the day and accom-
panied with various slides and
films like “Island in the Desert,”
about the taming of the Negev
desert. At noon, dancers from
Hillel Academy, organized by
Sharon Marine, performed a num-
ber of Israeli folk dances, with ob-
servers joining at the end of the

   

"-2

   

exhibition. More entertainment
was provided at two by the hit
singer, Gadi Elon, who sang a va-
riety of popular and traditional
folk songs.

A large selection of pamphlets
was available. On display were a
number of Israeli made art ob-
jects, including batiques. Art pos-
ters and Israeli jewelry were also
on sale.

 

Another main attraction was
the showing of the feature length
Israeli movie, Salah, starring
Haim Topol.

The purpose of Israeli Day, co-
sponsored by Students for Israel
and the Israeli Students Organiza-
tion, was to bring to both the cam-
pus and the community a flavor of
Israeli life and culture to foster

Robert Hickey, the assistant
registrar and a Ph.D. candidate
in the Graduate School of Educa-
tion, assessed several proposals

for innovations in the registration .

process during a recent Pitt News
interview.

Hickey, who came here a year
and a half ago from LaRoche Col-
lege ’where he did similar work,

saw the biggest change since his 0
, arrivial in “the attempt by the

staff of the Office of the Regis-
trar to increase the personaliza-

tion of this office in its dealings’

with the students and their prob-
lems.

Along this line he priased the
interests of students like Mike
Hout (CAS Cabinet chairman),
who have shown an interest in the
workings of the office. He pointed
out that‘Hout is actively working
in the office “to better familiar-
ize himself with the workings of
this office. We welcome this grow-
ing interest on the part of the stu-
dents and hope’ to benefit from
their suggestions.”

When asked about Hout’s pro-
posal of arena-type registration,
Hickey stated, “This type of reg-
istration represents something
we already attempted in the past
and I doubt if it is ideal for this

 University as it puts a tremen-
dous amount of pressure on all-

those involved.”

He cited the unwillingness of
faculty members and deans to sit
for days as one of the drawbacks.
Another would be “that students
would not receive invoices until
after the start of classes with a
sizeable number of students not

getting theirs until late in the I

term. This would prevent many
students from otherwise enjoying

Q university life to the fullest.”

- At present about 60 per cent of
the 27,000 students who go through
the office each term get their in-
voices before the start of the
term. Hickey hopes that this fig-
ure could be raised in the near fu-
ture.

Another proposal, computeriz-
ed registration, was seen by Hick-
ey “as depersonalizing the serv-
ice, because the student would
have little control over the selec-
tion of his days and hours for at
specific course. Under this form
of registration, a student would
select the course but the compu-
ter would select the days and the
hours.

  

- \

“Personal preference under
computerized registration would
be greatly minimized.”

He added that the independent
study and cross—registration op-
tions have not created special

problems for the staff, which M

numbers 40, except for a “calen-
dar problem,” which arises when

students register for a course in a ’

semester school. This means that
a student’s grade in the course
would have to be entered by hand
on his master card because of the
calendar differences in the giving

. out of grades of the two schools.

Also not causing any particular
problem for the office is a stu-

dent’s taking credits in different’

schools, such as CAS students who
take General Studies or graduate

courses. “The problem is with the

individual schools who unfortu-

nately try to discourage a student,

from taking credits outside his
own school,” said Hickey.

Hickey pointed out that the of-
fice is currently under self—eva1-
uation and commended “the in-
terest of students in the workings
of the Office of the Registrar.” He
welcome further concern and cri-
ticism.

“I have every hope that students
will find out that service to them
will increase as their interest in
our operation increases. I espe-
cially welcome the interest of

~ With the People’s Peace Trea-
ty at hand, I find myself in a
strange situation.
When I first heard of the trea-
ty, I was overwhelmed with en-

2 thusiasm. Sure, that’s it. If we

can get a million people to sign
this treaty, it might show the

government that a sizable num- »

ber of citizens of this benevolent

. country of ours want the war put

to an immediate end. “

But then, I began to do a little
soul searching. Sure, a million
signatures is a lot of ink. But

I ' will a million people sign the

‘treaty knowing that they are

if . committing an act of treason by

merely lending that document
their signature? ,
AND EVEN is a million peo-
ple do sign, will it really do any
good? After all, a petition in the
form of a treaty is just another

type of demonstration. And we ’
all know how far demonstrations ,

have gotten us. .

And another thing bothers me.
I’m afraid of the direction that

 Laos .Invasion Spurs People’s Invasion

Third Infantry Division of the Pup-
pet Thai army have gone into
Laos in coordination with the pup-
pet army at Loas. The PRG asserts
that U.S. ground troops, and not
just American advisors, are in-
volved and that round the clock
bombing to support the ground
troops is being carried out by the
U.S. Air Force in Laos.

“This military aggression is the
first stage of still a larger aggres-

of other people who are thinking
in the same way as you. Even if
you don’t know ‘the person

marching next to you, you sense _

a strong personal bond that may
escape you as soon as the dem-
onstration isover.

But despite the noble inten-
tions of the marchers, demon-
strations irratated more people
than they impressed.

AND NOW a new day is dawn-
ing on the movement. You must
be prepared to be arrested and
stake something much more
personal to the cause than just
sore feet.

Violence is also playing a
greater role in promoting peace.
I, for what little\‘its worth, can-
not condone any form of physical
violence. And this, for a large
part, includes buildings. Sure, a
building is a building is a build-
ing. But all too often buildings
contain things other than the
bombing objective. Sometimes
it’s a life, other times it may be
someone’s life work. These are

some extremely high prices to 4

pay in the name of peace.

Now -the question arises,
where does a person like myself
stand. I seek the same end re-
sults as everyone else (peace,

I’m at as loss for a solid place to

put my feet.

DEMONSTRATIONS are out
because they are ineffective.
Violence is out because I can’t
relate to it. And that leaves the
government.

The government may be im-
proving (there have been recent
breakthroughs in the Congres-
sional seniority system and we
can always hope that someone
else will be elected President in
’72) but the improvements are
much too slow. All too_often, de-
cisions are made with ethics be-
ing forgotten and the bank ac-
count fattened. Therefore, I hes-
itate in trusting the government.

I just seem to be floating in a
swamp of opinions. And, at the
same time, I feel obligated to
make the moral decision that is
needed, to choose a side. But I
can’t.

clans as “Africanos”?

It is a word that exists in their dictionary. They could have used
it. However, they did not use it for to call a man by the name of his
homeland is to accord him something called human dignity.

They called him instead, “Negro”-a Spanish word which
means black—not the new interpretation of “Black” with its positive
connotations, but the old black which in the English language has
120 negative synonyms. /

I LOOKED UP a few of these synonymns in Roget’s Thesaurus.
Read them carefully and make your own judgments as to the effect.
that such synonyms have had on the American mentality: Darkness,

‘obscurity, blot, blotch. smut, smudge, smirch, inky, pitchy, sooty,

swarthy, dusky, dingy, blotchy, smudgy, and low-toned. Thus, the
English language has--brainwashed us into associating everything
dark with evil: Devil’s food cake is dark, for example, while ange1’s
food cake is white. ’

Yes, the synonyms range from “darkness” to “1ow-toned.” To

add insult to injury, the Thesaurus inserts in the middlesof this series .

of descriptions: “Negro, Negress, blackamoor, man of color», colo_r-
ed man, colored woman, nigger . . ., darky . . ., black, Ethiop, Ethio-
pian, Hottentot, Pygmy, Bushman, Africian." The word Negro,
therefore, born of intentional insult in Spain, has been nurtured by
the forces of a racist vocabulary in a racist society in America.

The word “Negor” rings a bell of past sufferings which Afri-
can men, women, and children as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean to
slave on American soil.

“NEGRO” REMINDS US of the times when Black men were
equated with property. K ‘ ‘

“Negro’_’ spells oppression which has marked every day of the
Black man’s past in America.

“Negro” means second class citizenship, poor housing, low
wages, unemployment, and underemployment.

“THE TERM “NEGRO” means to have no history—no American
history, no African history, no world history.

But most important, the term “Negro” has signalled a time for
change. ' I

I don’t believe that the change started with Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King. Nor do I believe that it started with Malcolm X, or
Stokely Carmichael, or Rap Brown, or with the Black Panthers. It
all began with the tears of the African mother which rolled down her
bosom as she quietly prayed for a day of liberation for the future
generations of her womb. That day came.

IT CAME WITH the cries that “Black (with a capital B) is beau-
tiful.” It came with the marches of protest in many cities across the
nation. It came with the unfortunate incidents of violence. It came
with the demands for Black history. It came with the demands of
quality education for all.

In conclusion, it should be said that regardless of the implica-
tions of being called a Negro or a Black man, we should respect
each other’s right to call ourselves whatever we wish to. Bickering
over whether we are Negro, Black, Afro-American, or colored peo-
ple could cause unnecessary division among a group of people who
have been divided too long and who have come too far in overcoming
this disunity. Let there be love between us-—regardless of what we
call ourselves. However, I would be remiss if I did not say that it is
part of my dream that we shall all accept being called Black men be-
cause it does make a difference. N

Pennsylvania Coordinator,‘ EA/ZPG

Is industrial pollution a technical problem? Or is it a problem of corporate arro-
, gance, corporate secrecy, corporate irresponsibility? Although the answer may vary
. from plant to plant, we unfortunately learn that the balance is titled toward the latter.

The question that we allmust ask is how we can make the corporations behave re-
V sponsibly. This is the aim of a new Ralph Nader task force which has visited the home of
one of the world’s biggest carbon products plants in Anmore, W. Va.

The village villain in this case: Union Carbide, a billion-dollar international cor-
‘V poration that cultivates a public service image, which continues to flank the western edge
‘ of this tiny hill town and uses the entire valley as an air pollution dump.

THE AIM OF THE new Nader task force is to enforce through public demand a
. change in Union Carbide’s priorities.

One may wonder what role we play in this American tragedy as members of the
r , University community. This may best be explained by quoting from a letter written to
Environmental Action/ZPG at Pitt by Ralph Nader on January 22, 1971. -

It states, “Your school, the University of Pittsburgh is an institutional.share-
holder in Union Carbide-—which for the last ten years has contaminated the Ohio Valley
from its Marietta plant with 246,350 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 44,586 pounds of parti-
culate matter each day. Its intransigence provides you with the opportunities to act as

2 members of a university that holds Union Carbide shares which can be a medium for
4 your concerns.” ‘

IN A COPY OF a letter forwarded to EA/ZPG’s office by Nader which he recent-
L ly sent to Senator Edmund Muskie, chairman of the Subcommittee on Air and Water Pol-
) lution, several specific instances for Union Carbide’s totalplackof concern and utter dis-

Finally after years of studies, meetings, and reports through which the Federal“
government has made vain attempts to diminish the intensity of Union Carbide’s assault
on the lives, health, and property of its neighbors, the newly created Department of En-
vironmental Protection stepped in. E a

On Jan. 8 of this year, Mr. Ruckelshaus, secretary of DEP, ordered the corpora-
tion to comply, as a bare minimum, with clean-up deadlines first issued in April and
March of 1970. Among other things, he called for: ‘(a) An immediate 40 per cent reduction
in sulfur oxides emissions; (2) A 70 per cent reduction of sulfur oxides by April, 1972;
(3) A 25 per cent reduction of fly ash (particulate) emissions by September 19, 1971.

UNION CARBIDE HAS MADE no attempt to meet these or any other deadlines of
the abatement conference. The 40 per cent reduction of sulfur oxides was originally to be
accomplished by October 20, 1970. Union Carbide, imagining itself immune from the law,
allowed that date to pass without taking any action.

As far as University involvement, a list of selected holdings of universities around

the country in Union Carbide places Pitt among the most prestigious of all the schools
in the nation.

The University owns the fourth largest number of shares of any school in the na-
tion, surpassed only by Harvard (a), Princeton (2), and Penn (3). The University owns
some 10,200 shares, over 24 per cent of the total shares owned by university and colleges.

IS IT NOT THE responsibility of the University community to show some concern
over our involvement? Is it not our responsibility to make sure the public will never be
cowed by Union Carbide again. vi

Through the joint efforts of the Environmental Defense Fund, Inc., Ralph Nader
and his Task Force, and Environmental Action, Inc. (the national office of Pitt’s En-
vironmental Action/ZPG) the fight has just begun, but assummed up by one of Naderls
imen-the fight that is comin is oing to be it Wat:erloo..  I ‘ = I " » ~ P re

TrackTeam Shines In Sun. 

by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt track team sent six
individuals and two relay teams
to the Baltimore Sun Games Sat-
urday night and walked away
with two first place wins, one
second place and a third place
finish.

Jerry Richey, who has become
one of the premier two-milers

- in the country, won the 2—mile

event in the Games. Richey’s
time of 8254.0 was slower than
he has run in the past, but he
still managed to best the rest of
the competition.

Smittie Brown also continued
to win. Brown, running the 600-
yd. dash in Baltimore, won with
a brisk 1211.6.

The mile relay team had
trouble on the baton exchange
again, but this time, the trouble
was not of their making.

“Someone stepped in front of
Smittie (Brown) on the ex-
change,” Pitt coach Jim Banner
said. “He had to go way up on
the track as a result. He made
it up, but the team lost by one-
tenth of a second.”

Rutgers won the mile relay
with a 3:22.3, which tied the
Baltimore record.

Had the baton difficulties not
occurred, the Pitt team would
have undoubtedly won the event
and would have set a new re-
cord. The Sun tracksters time
(3:22.4) is four seconds above
their usual time. Last week, at
the Pitt Invitational, they ran

the mile in 3:l8.4. Along with

  Cagers
Going

by MARTY HELLMAN

Because of their respective
earlier season’s accomplishments,

nearly everyone expected a lop-’

sided game between the Pitt
Panthers and the Carnegie-Mel-
lon Tartans on Saturday after-
noon at the Field House.

Yet it took the much taller
Panthers over half of the game
to pull away from the hustling
Tartans enroute to a 118-84
victory.

The Tartans compensated for a
distinct lack of height (starters
averaging just six feet) by their
quickness and aggressiveness un-
der the boards in the first half
and only trailed by 57-47 at in-
termission.

Tartan coach Jim Brown felt
that the margin should have been
even closer. He referred to a
missed call of defensive goal-
tending by Panther Bill Sulkow-
ski and the referee’s denial of a
shot by Kevin Cotter at the buz-
zer.

"Our boys
hard,” commented Brown, “and
some of those calls just took the
insides out of some of the play-
ers. They were so mad at half-
time that I was afraid of them

‘letting down, which they did in

the second half."

At the outset, the Tartans rac-
ed to a 9-1 lead and the sparse
crowd of 1,260 was buzzing.
Three straight baskets by Paul
O’Gorek sparked the Panther
comeback, and with 13:30 on
the clock a tip in by Carl Mor-
ris gave the Cats the advantage
for good.

Fouls on Tartan guards Gene
Turner, Jeffrey Hollis and Ian
Von Lindern in the first half
proved to be key factors in the
Tartans downfall. After Hollis
fouled out with only four min-
utes gone in the‘ second half,
CMU lost momentum and fell
way behind the Panthers.

“Obviously, a team like ours
doesn’t have tremendous depth,”
said Brown, “and when we got

“Dave didn’t do as well ‘as he

Dorel Watley, also running in

Most of the track team will be

that they didn’t want to get beat,”

Hollis, who played an inspir-

can. We figured that we had

2-Meet Road Swing

The swimmers sank American U., 65-48, for their first win of the
season Friday, then succumbed to Maryland University, 72-40, Saturday.

At American U. Pitt’s Rick Rowe took the 100- and 500—freestyle
events with times of 1:54 and 5 :27, respectively.

Fred Lewis placed first in the 100-freestyle and the Panther swim-

mers took the medley relay.

For the first time this season the mermen won an individual med-

ley event--Lewis caught Ameri-
can U.’s swimmer and touched
him out. Then in the 100-yard
backstroke Jack Veitch captured
first and Dave Anderson won the
butterfly.

The swimmers’ top diver Dave
Wessel participated only in the
one-meter event due to illness and
placed first in that event.

What did the team think about
the first victory of the season?

“It was almost degrading,” re-
“They lacked
depth and manpower and our
times were the worst of the year.”

Tom Hayes who placed second
in the 100-free, pointed out that
“it wasn’t any race.”

Mark Cohen remakred, “It was
a farce. They weren’t in shape to
beat us, but in December they
could have. I don’t believe they
really wanted to win.”

The meet at Maryland U. was
as Cohen put it, “a joke.” Lewis
took the 100-free, Veitch placed
first in the 200-back, and Rowe
raced to first in the 500-yard free-
style.

In one-meter diving Wessel

again ranked number one.

Maryland swam only one—half L

of their squad, and as Hayes re-
marked, “was still completely out
of of our class.

Rowe further explained that the
mermen didn’t have their line-
up until 10 minutes before the
meet and went into it with a “jok-
ing attitude.”

Pitt fell to highly touted Massa-
chusetts University Saturday,
141.85—126.40, but not before
throwing a scare into the visitors.

Pitt took an early lead 24.85-
23.20 in the floor exercise with
Lowell Meek making his first
start in three meets and he scored
9:20 for a first place in the floor
exercise followed by Mass’ Jack
Berner.

Phil Lilly’s 8.60 was enough to
take the side horse event, a place
where Pitt has had difficulty win-
ning this year.

Neiger said after the meet,
“The sidehorse team really came
through for us.” “

Jim Bilec tied Mass’ Jay Aron-

stein for the first place on the still
rings, 8.60, followed closely by

“I was very pleased to get
that many ballplayers into the
game,” said Rid] after his tenth
win this year. “I was particular-
ly happy with Steve Lewis.”

Lewis, a 6-2 guard who has
seen limited action this season,
hit 5-for-6 in the closing mo-
ments to be one of the six Pan-
thers in double figures.

O’Gorek and Buzzy Harrison
paced the squad with 17 each

.while Kent Scott and Morris

netted 16 apiece.

CMU’s Cotter was the leading
scorer in the game with 26
points, and seven rebounds de-
spite being the smallest man on
the court.

Assistant Coach Fran Webster
explained the Panther’s poor de-
fensive play in the first half
when CMU had many open
shots.

“It was partly my fault be-
cause we were trying different
keys on defense and the boys
were reacting a bit hesitantly,”
he explained.

“It was a welcome surprise to

be inthe lead,” commented in-

jured Dan Campbell. “In fact
coach said he wanted me throw a
routine on the high bar.”

Dick Prihis was edged out by

C Jay Thompson of Mass, 8:40 to

8.75, but Pitt outscored the New
Englanders by a quarter of a
point on the long horse vault.

Due to the efforts of Pribis,

Chris Gardnerrand Beatty, Pitt

only trailed by two tenths of a
point after the parallel bars event.‘
Pribis came in second (7.25),

Pitt could only muster 9.80

in the final score.

Meek. “Everyone hit their routine
