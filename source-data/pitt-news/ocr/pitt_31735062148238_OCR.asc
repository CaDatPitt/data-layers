Jones’ Pass
To Thurbon
Gives Victory

By Bert_Jaffe

“Special Delivery” Jones has
ﬁnally arriVed—-via air mail.

Carnegie Tech ’s Tartan felt‘ the
wrath of a bench-warming sopho-
more Saturday as Pitt’s fair-liaiiu
ed boy of the class of ’42 whip-
ped a strike through the air into
the waiting arms of Bobby Thur-
bon in "the end zone for the_ only
score in the annual local classic.

Once before in the ﬁnal quarter,
the Golden Panther threatened the
Skibo goal line, but Emil Narick’s
fumble on the six yard line with
third down and one to go nulliﬁed
this attempt. ~

The miscue was a blow to Narick
who, up to then, had been a highly
satisfactory performer, crashing
through for valuable yardage when
it was needed the most.

_Both teams had" touchdowns in
their grasps earlier in the battle but
aerial. attempts failed to ﬁnd the re-
ceiver or» were dropped. Pitt had
six points marked on the scoreboard
until Condit’s hand deﬂected the oval
out of Rettinger’s reach, Carnegie’s
aerial thrust from Muha to Condit
was dropped by the latter in the end
zone. ‘ - '

Saturday’s game proved to be the _

outstanding ganie attthe Pitt Stadium

this year, overshadowing the Carne-
gie-Notre Dame, Pitt—Duke, and Pitt-
Duquesne tussles.

tem of starting his second ball club,
but the move failed to work as it
had for the “Lucky” Irish. And

Fine Arts Department Opens
Exhibit of Ancient Persian Art

By Anita Barone

An outstanding exhibition of Per-
sian art which -includespottery, tex-
/tiles, and miniatures, opens today in
the ﬁne arts gallery on theseventh
ﬂoor, Cathedral. The exhibit is the
first of its kind in Pittsburgh.

Decorative designs which origin-
ated in Persia have been the loveliest

' of all times, and are still reﬂected in

:much of our contemporary art. In
»-the recent exhibit of Pennsylvania

' folk art there were examples of mo-
tifs which resemble closely the early
Persian designs.

:,.:;':.~,}-; The pottery is extremely rare and
.. I-,~, when found in perfect condition is
:_ almost priceless.

The ancient period is represented
by pottery, the earliest dated 1500 B.
».C., and some excellent examples of
the Luristan bronzes from the sev-
enth century B. C. Included in the
Luristan bronzes are horse bits, rein
rings, with animal head decorations,
and implements such as knife
handles.

_ Most of the exhibition emphasizes
the art of the Islamic period which
began in.the eighth ‘century with the

1l\/Iohammedan invasions. Examples
iof this period include Gabri ware
sand the famous Rhages ware. The
gpottery of this period extends from
ithe eighth century to the sixteenth.
icentury. .
 Worthy of mention among the tex-
ltiles is a rare Persian wedding dress
‘from the sixteenth century.

J The minatures, for which Persia is
lwell known, are dated from the ﬁf-
Tteenth to the seventeenth, centuries.
;They include pictures of kings, gods,
;and illustrations of ancient tales.
§They are delicate illuminations and
‘are important for therbeauty of the
script as well as the pictures them-
selves.

The majority of the pieces in the
exhibit were loaned by the Persian
Antique gallery, New York.

The exhibition Wlll continue
through December 2, and the public
is invited.

In conjunction with the exhibit
Dr. Andrey Avinoff, assistant profes-
sor of ﬁne arts, will give a lecture on
Persian art in the department of ﬁne
arts next Monday evening at 8:30
o’clock. ' ‘

‘New Refugee Student Describes _

Air Raid Precautions in Europe ~

By Ralph Kallock
“Lucky” is the way Ernest Masur,
E41, German refugee student, de-

-scribes himself after having left Ger-

many two weeks before war was de-
clared to come to the United States
and receive the ﬁrst refugee com-
mittee scholarship granted by the
University.

Forced to wait more than a year
for his passport visa, Masur went to

England before boarding the United

States liner Manhattan bound for
New York. Two weeks later, on
September 4, England declared war
on Germany. His father, a Berlin
physician, and his mother are still
in Germany.

Until the declaration of war, ac-
cording to Masur, the German peo-
ple held a dim, though fading hope
that Britain, whose strength and in-
tentions were generally underesti-
mated, would avert hostilities. Dur-
ing the period of ‘‘watchful waiting,”
however, the German government
rehearsed the populace in civilian
tléfense.  i - f .

Masur, who witnessed air raid
blackouts in both Berlin and London,
compared the eﬁiciency of-.the.'per—
formance in the two cities. The»Ger-
man precautions were more perfect
than those of England because they
were held earlier in the evening
when Berlin was experiencing the
peak of its night life, whereas the
British blackouts usually took place
after midnight when most of the
lights were normally extinguished.
In England, too, the people were re-
quested to take part in the rehearsals;
in Germany participation was - re-
quired and Nazi police enforced the
regulations which were posted on
the bulletin columns on every corner.

What the war will do to the Ger-
man universities and how it will af-
fect the educational spirit of stu-
dents, Masur would not predict. Prior
to the outbreak of the war universi-
ties evidenced remnants of the old
spirit of freedom despite government-
inspired tendencies toward regimen-
tation. German scholaars like all

The Sad Case
0f Miss Hawkins

Refreshing cha11‘gei"from'the‘ dreary parade of"

‘war news is the series of Sadie Hawkins day cele-
brations which have been sweepng college campi
throughout the nation. In over a hundred institu-
tions of higher learning, coeds and their dates have
portrayed the parts of Daisy Mae and U11 Abner
in approved hillbilly style at the man-hunt races
«and dances of the Sadie Hawkins festivities.

Early this month, Sadie Hawkins invaded Pitts-
burgh as part of an editorial promotion plan of
one of the Pittsburgh newspapers. Of course, the
«purpose of the idea was a huge hillbilly celebration
for students of the three major city schools.

At Duq11ésn‘é,".t'l1e "D‘ttke,"“Studgcn.t 'neWSpa.peI',:
was. the sponsor of what was to have been a ‘niag-g
niﬁcént hillbilly affair. Carnegie Tech ’s Student
Council sponsored a Sadie Hawkins day, complete
with the comic-strip trimmings. Pitt alone of the
"city schools escaped the Sadie Hawkins wave‘ be-
cause St11dent-Facultly Associatioii”'s‘executive com-
mittee, despite the ‘fervent pleas of volatile Jack
Hoeveller, turned thumbs down on the idea.

_More‘refreshing than the idea, fromla news
standpoint, were the results of Sadie Hawkins’
visit to ‘Pitt'sburgh’s higher learning. Carnegie
Tech’s man-hunt race was a complete ﬂop, accord-
ing to ‘the Tartéin. The dance, billedias ‘a hillbilly
costume affair, was successful, although only eight
costurned couples appeared.

At Duquesne, the Sadiellawkins day never ma-
zterialized. The day before the scheduled afternoon
inan-hunt and evening dance, the Dulce appeared
with a front‘-page editorial announcing the can-'
-«cellation of the affair, and adding: C

“Although, at present, the exact cause for
 the cancellation "cannot be determined, it is ‘be-
jlielved by a majority that, to the best interests
 ‘ those directly concerned, the plans be
,_ dropped. ’ ’ ‘

Common’ Sense
By ‘Senator’ Ziskind

The attempted assassination of Herr Hitler is only
an incidental prelude to what reactions the German
government will face from its own people.
forces may ﬁnd little occasion for prolonged warfare;
for the seeds of Germany’s destruction are implanted
within her own soil.

In Germany, behind the march of soldiers, the
raucous roar of “Heil, Heil, Fuehrer,” behind the cheer-
ing and “calm” and “sacriﬁce”-——behind all this surface
display and show, stand men who think and wait. They
talk in hushed voices; they swear themselves ‘to secrecy;
they pledge allegiance to their one sacred cause of free-
ing Germany from medieval despotism.

With box in hand, a young German goes to the
top ﬂoor of at Berlin skyscraper. Carefully he fastens
the box to the window sill, precariously balanced, so
that the first wind could tilt it over and empty its
contents of leaﬂets over the German thoroughfare.
Down below, people --hastily pick them up. “Free
yourself from Hitler bondage,” they read. ~“The Ger-
‘man people must ‘l5‘e’gin’~to live!”

Or a large truck drives through German towns. It
carries an innocent sign reading: “Fritz’s Hauling.”
From the back one sees pieces of furniture protruding

from under the canvas curtain, while men inside busily

broadcast from an improvised short-wave radio set.
The speaker, in German, calls upon the German peo-
ple to revolt, and at the same time divulges military
secrets for British and French use.

Another truck drives to a crowded intersection. The
driver hurriedly leaves a bundle of papers. On their
front page they contain an appealing advertisement, the
second page a large picture of “Der Fuehrer,”’ while
hidden inside is the revelation of recent events which
the Propaganda Ministry had suppressed.

iMoret‘§nd-more people find» them. They report their
ﬁndings to others who in turn repeat the procedure.

The German secret police hunt these men. They
catch some. These are sent to certain death. But others
go uncaught, and so their work goes on.

Indeed, I was not surprised to hear of the Munich
bombing. The secret underground movement expressed
itself in a more dramatic form than usual, winning at-
tention from the outside world.

That such a society should exist is simply a natural
outgrowth of suppression and dictatorshi-p.: No other
form of opposition to the present German Government
could exist other than meeting its suppression with
assassination and revolt.

The spirit of a people to be free can never be ex-
tinguished by government edict. For a time it may‘
’Tseem that the government has succeeded in destroy-
ing man’s thirst forlfreedofn. But‘ ‘-Iatt3'l'~,"=einevitably,
from... somewhere this spirit will triumph even if it
be over the corpses of those who tried hardest to
suppress it. -

Intercollegiate

Appeal For F -reedom

“The central issue the University confronts is how

adequately to offer its students the chance they deserve. .

It will not be easy. It means more freedom——for teacher
and student alike. It means more leisure for ‘thought,
more opportunity for research. It means the recogni-
tion on the part of the community that, as Edmund
Burke once said, the temple of truth should be erected
upon an eminence. '

“If the citizens . . . want their students to get from
the University all that is in it to give, they must be pre-
pared to recognize that the road to intellectual achieve-
ment lies through the high road of freedom. They must
be ready for experiment in ideas. They must recognize
that a new world is being created before our eyes, and
that we cannot map its frontiers without the risk of a
voyage of exploration. They must be willing for the
economist and political scientist to do in the realm of
ideas what Lewis and Clark did in the realm of physi-
cal discovery. And the way to make the citizens realize
the urgency of this attitude ‘is for teacher and student
alike to stand four square against those who would make
the University accept the truths of the past rather than
investigate the potentialities ofthe future.

“A new idea has the same right to its welcome  3
new machine. But the new idea will only come as the
scholar is assured of the unfettered right to freely pro-
mulgate its substance”, , .

the Pitt squad had and oﬁered his
congratulations to Bowser and h1S

their end.

Pitt’s touchdown march started
on its own 31 yard line and ﬁnally
ended as Thurbon-"hauled in Jones’
long aerial with Skibos swarming all
around the “Under Pup.”

Consistent gains by Thurbon and
Jones earned the Panthers two con-

most of the yardage.

Jones faded back, evaded one charg-

both teams had to be helped off, the

Johnny Dickinson, Pitt’s acting
captain of the day, suffered a knee
injury mid-way in the ﬁrst quarter
as he stopped Tech’s Jordano on a
punt return. “Dickshot” watched the
rest of the game from the hardwood.

Tech’s George Muha, a ﬁne half-
back all afternoon, twisted a leg

The Panthers can expect a wild
pass onslaught by Paul Christman
and his Missouri teammates when
they invade the Stadium to open
the Pitt season on Saturday, Octo-
ber 5, 1940.

Christman is compiling one of
the greatest‘ passing records in
modern football. Up to last Sat-
urday, Pitching Paul had connected
with his receiver on 41 out of 82
tries, an average of .500. His best
day was against Nebraska when he
knocked th.e Huskers from the un-
beaten list by completing eight

passes in 12 attempts. .

A clever runner and a headyﬁeld
general, Christman is the coolest
man in the Tiger lineup. Many of
his passes are thrown after enemy
tacklers have hit him.

. Nick Kliskey, Pitt assistant coach
who has scouted the Tigers, reports
that, working behind a rugged line,
Christman is almost unstoppable.

Trackman. Al errara Becomes
Coacli Al iferrara, Wins Crown

By Ben Foote

Al Ferrara, Ed40, now belongs to

the select group of coaches who have

Last week a Ferrara-coached cross country team,

.‘ Schenley high school, won the annual citv meet.
A coach’s dream is to win a championship; relatively few can realize

this dream.‘ Ferrara, with another year of inter-collegiate competition still
. ahead of mm, accomplished a feat few mentors do in 15 years.

Al, a senior in the school of com-9

mercial education, was sent to Schen-
ley high for his nractice teaching.

  
   

AL FERRARA

' One day he wandered into the S(:hen-
ley high gym and noticed some
schoolboys doing their “laps_.”' He’

watched them for several minutes
then started to give a few hints on
S‘tE‘ld.i"";:§, arm action, and some other
pliases of running.

It wasn’t long before the whole
squad stopped running and gathered
arourd Ferrara. .he Pitt star, a
natural worker with boys, became so
earnest with his new proteges that
the Schenley physical education in-‘
structors were attracted to the group.
The gym teachers, having had much
experience in track athletics, asked

Ferrara if he would like to add the
tutelage of the Schenley high cross
country team to his practice teaching
duties.

He accepted, discharging his coach-
ing tasks gratis in order to keep his
amateur standing.

He took time every evening to take
the boys over to the Schenley park
schoolboy course, and in four weeks
he developed a squad of green young-
stersinto a championship high school
team.

The name Al Ferrara, will be re-
membered for many years as that of
one of Pitt’s track greats during the
“Golden Age” in Panther cinder his-
‘tory. He ran on six of the seven
championship relay teams, which
dominated the Penn Relays in 1938

A 27-13 shellacking was applied
by the Fijis to the team that lost to

Watson’s passes began by fizzling,
and Snuffy Hughes’ were clicking
for gains when Dimit’s interception
of one reversed the situation. Wat-
son threw two passes: result, a touch-
down. A brief Phi Delt outburst fol-
lowed with Hughes tossing one to
Dunbar for a score that tied the
game and a conversion by Hughes
that gave the Phi Delts a lead.

That was the last taste of victory
they had, for three plays later an-

they never relinquished. The half
ended with the score standing 13-7.

With the second half, the Phi

and the result was touchdown num-

build up to that scoring pass was
another pass for 35 yards featuring
none other than Watson and Ed-
munds. The extra point was added
when MacNeil took a toss from Wat-
son.

All this time Snuffy Hughes’ passes

Mets Win in Overtime

The engineering bracket swung in-H _ 

to its ﬁnals last Friday, too. The

Metallurgists, who need but one loss 7

to drop them from the running, took
the Chem Seniors in an overtime bat-
tle, 7-6. All the scoring, except the
deciding point, took place in the ﬁrst
ﬁve minutes of the game.

“ Tom Lynch threw three passes for

the Chem 1. Seniors in the, ﬁrst ‘three . .

plays of the game. The third one
was good for a touchdown to Chlem.
Several minutes later the Mets’ ace
passer, Leith tossed one to Knapp
for the tying marker. From then
on it was a cutthroat battle, both
teams trying desperately for a score
neither could get.

Leith, Pataky, Thom, and O’Don-
nel were the Mets’ main threats
while Lynch, Burrier and Ebert made
up a formidable Chem Senior tri-
umvirate.

Final Today

The game see-sawed in the min-
utes remaining after the tallies. In
an extra period each side took ﬁve
alternating turns with the ball try-
ing to move it over for a score.

The ball was placed at midfield
and worked down to the Chems’ 10
yard line by the Mets. There the
Met offense ceased and the Chem
Seniors had their chance, but they
failed to move the ball into Metal-
lurgical territory and so lost the
game, 7-6.

This afternoon these two teams
battle it out again, another Met vic-
tory meaning the league champion-
ship.

Many of you have probably won-

their cognomen. Ollie Stiﬁ deserves
full credit for the babtism. When
the fellows signed to play, they could
think of no suitable name. They left
it to Ollie. Mr. Stiff thought of
“Punks”; thus any one of the new

six months and to complete two years
of military training‘.

In these requirements and in other
ways, the German university forms
a strong contrast to those in Amer-
ica. Students who register and pay a
fee for a course can “cut class” as
tbfter as they like and nobody will
object. Not even if the cut extends

for the duration of the course, or for c

‘a year or two. At the end of three
years and not later than ﬁve years
after the student enters theuniver-S
sity, he is thoroughly examined, and
if found wanting, failed. »

The general practice is to let work .

months, Masur pointed out, and then 3

THERE ARE FOUR TYPES

of tobaccos found in the more popular
cigarettes, uumeb7...Brz'ght,M aryland, C P
Burley and Turkish. 1

ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is
bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece)

, and Maryland (Which is bought through sealed bids
""'under”g‘ovei‘nment ‘supervis-ion) are bought .. at public
auction, just like any other auction Where you might
have bought in a table or a chair.

I‘'“

AT THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in
baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and
each purchaser buys all of his tobaccos by competitive
bidding for the particular piles he wants.

THE CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of
these mild ripe tobaccos for the Chesterﬁeld blend.
And it is Chestev-ﬁeld’s Combination . . . the right amounts
of Burley and Bright . . . just enough Maryland . . . and
just enough Turkish—that makes the big difference
between Chesterﬁeld and other cigarettes.

5

IT IS BECAUSE of this combination
that Chesterﬁelds are COOLER, have
a BETTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY
MILDER. They are made of the world’s
best cigarette tobuccos. You can’t buy
a better cigarette.
