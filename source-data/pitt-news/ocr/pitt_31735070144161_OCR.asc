Pitt students will find them-
selves returning to the polls Nov.

the Student Government Board.
Fourteen students representing
six slates —+ Integrity, One Passion
One Pride, One Vision One Voice,
Revolution, Students Always and
Students First — are campaigning
for the chance to sit on SGB. Each
suggests different ways to improve
campus life. ‘

If you thought the presidential
campaigns were over, you thought
wrong. There are four people run-
ning for president of Pitt’s Student
Government Board.

Former College Democrats
member Dan Gore, SGB alloca-
tions chair Kevin Morrison, current
board member Amanda Reed and
Sodexho student manager. Justin
Romeo set up Web sites and Fa-

cebook groups to spread the word

_ about their candidacies.
The candidates sat down with

The Pitt News to talk about their ’
. fee for the national student-lobbying

reasons for  for president.

Dan Gore — Revolution slate
Pitt Revolution started when its

members, Dan Gore, Resident Stu-

dents Association president Alicia

Simpson and engineering student‘

Joe Rendemonti, all voiced com-
plaints about student government,

said Gore.

Gore, ‘the son of immigrants
from what is now Ukraine, speaks
ﬂuent Russian and is the vice presi-
dent of the Russian Club. He has
served as the political steering chair
of‘ College Democrats and was the
founder of Pitt’s Students for Ba-
rack Obama chapter. A g ’

Gore said he thinks being new to
SGB is an asset.

“I don’t have experience wasting
money,” he said. “I don’t have expe—.
rience making poor choices. I don’t
have experience wasting money to-
wards organizations that don’t di-
rectly support Pitt students.”

Paying the $4,250 membership

group United States Student Associ-
ation was an example of supporting
an indirect organization, he said.

Gore said his slate wants _to work
with the University to cut wasteful
spending as tuition rises.

“We want to restore ﬁscal in-
tegrity to "SGB, as well as lobby the

Four. run for president

University to amend its spending
habits,” said Gore. “We want to
lobby the University to stop spend-
ing money on these ‘programs and
events that no 'one really goes to so
we don’t have to have such a tuition
increase.”

. He said an example was the Nor- _

dy’s Place game room, which he said

was aesthetically pleasing but had no

pragmatic beneﬁt

“You notice no ones in there,”
he said, “but I wonder how much
money that costs.”

Gore’s slate also proposes put-
ting the allocations chair appoint-
ment in the hands of student orga-
nizations rather than SGB itself, for
greater accountability in allocations
decisions.

“SGB has consistently failed to
heed -the interests of students at
the University of Pittsburgh,” said
Gore. “We feel it doesn’t adequately
represent, students. We’re just 
to restore integrity to the organiza-
tion and ensure that it becomes the

Kevin Morrison —
One Vision One
Voice slate

Kevin ‘Morrison V
said that from the first
time he visited his sister
at Pitt whilehe was in
high school, he had no ,
other choice for a college.

“I love Pitt so much,” he said. “I '

' know it sounds cliche, but I love the

idea of  back to the students.”

Morrison, a former Eagle Scout
from York, Pa, interned for the
board his freshman year and has
been with the allocations committee
for two years.

He said he’s seen both good and
bad in SGB. ‘

“Because of my experience, I’ve
seen where SGB.needs to go,” he
said. “SGB is in decline. There’s a
disconnect between SGB and what
the students need.”

politics.

V “If you got an
eighth of students to
vote in local politics, we could con-

The board’s constitution asks
SGB to represent the needs of '
students at federal, state and local
levels, and Morrison -said that lob-
bying elected officials, especially lo-
cal ones, is an important part of his

_ slate’s platform.

Morrison and his fellow slate
members say on their Web site that
they want to encourage more stu-
dents to vote, partly because Pitt
students contribute to the city econ-
omy.

Morrison said students at Pitt
and other universities in Pittsburgh
need to vote together for issues that

rison.' “I just see Pitt

Amanda Reed -— Students First
slate

Current board member Amanda
Reed choose Pitt as a second choice
to Georgetown. She followed the
advice of friends and mentors, who
suggested she choose Pitt_ with a

 

scholarship, and found that it was a
great school. '

‘Reed, a Harrisburg native, said
she decided to run for SGB last year
after she got involved in the United
States Student Association, a nation-
al student lobbying group whose
merits have been debated by some
current board members.

Reed said she heard about her
friends’ victories through USSA,
 , such as how Univer-

 sity of California stu-
dents convinced their
state system to divest
from companies af-

in Darfur. She said she
wanted to * bring that
kind of representation
to SGB.

Reed has served on SGB for the
past year. She’s worked on projects
such as revamping the Pitt Compass
student directoiy and, with the help
of board member Ryan Haddad, on
Pitt Make a Difference Day.

Reed also chairs the multi/ bi-

fecting the genocide’

 iﬁsize their SGB experience

racial caucus in USSA. Some of her
projects, such as.the “zero award”
faculty diversity project the student
speak-out in April and her work
with the Student Vote Coalition, are
affiliated with USSA.

This year, Reed will run with cur-
rent board member Nila Devanath
and Inter-Fraternity Council vice
president Charlie Shull.

Reed wants to implement man-

, datory out-of—of{-ice hours for board

members, where members would
do their work in a popular place on

campus, such as the Litchfield Tow- V

ers or the Hillman Library
“I feel like we lose touch,” she

said. “If you’re out on campus and ‘

not just in the office, doing the
‘same old, same old,’ I think it’s go-
ing to change how students see stu-
dent government and how we see
Student Government Board.”

Reed said the out-of-office re-

quirement and creating an Advoca— ,

cy Task Force that talks to students
directly can help students get more

V involved in SGB.

are not held accountable for their
promises, and that is something
Integrity wants to change,” said

Noh. “We want to have [the] in- -

tegrity within ourselves to be fair
and objective when dealing with
student issues.” ‘‘

Noh said that, if elected, she
hopes to change the residence
halls’ guest sign-in system so that
students will be able to swipe
friends into their dorms, instead of
having to write their names down
on a sheet of paper. This, she said,
will reduce the amount of time
people spend waiting in line to sign
guests in and out of dorms. 4

Noh said she’d also like to im-
prove SafeRider by adding more
vehicles or improving the current
pickup routes.

But her most important goal,
she said, is to increase the number
of study areas on campus, spe-
ciﬁcally by adding more tables and
reopening locked individual study
rooms on the third and fourth
ﬂoors of the Hillman Library.

“I just think it’s logical for the
largest library on Pitt’s‘ campus to
have ample space for students to
be able to study,” said Noh; “It’s
a common frustration of mine to
walk around the library for 20 min-
utes or so  to ﬁnd a table, and
I am sure many other students feel
the same way.”

' Noh served as a freshman peer
counselor at Pitt last summer. She
is now a Pathﬁnder and a member
of various student organizations,
including the Asian Students Al-

liance and Best Buddies. She said

she thinks she could represent stu-
dents effectively because she can
relate to them.

“I am a pretty average person,
and I feel like I can represent the

student body well,” she said. “I -

love the University of Pittsburgh,
but I "do believe that there are cer-
tain  that will ‘make it a better

. place for all students.”

Wilson, a junior majoring in re-
habilitation science and pre-phys-

‘ical therapy, said in an e—mail that

she hopes to increase the amount
of organic, healthy foods in on-

campus dining, to improve Pitt’s
ﬁtness centers‘ and to increase the
hours of operation for Student
Health Services and the ﬁtness
centers. She is a member of Alpha
Delta Pi sorority, Pitt Dance Mara-
thon and Pitt Ski and Snowboar
Club. ' '

One Passion One Pride

The candidates for One Pas-
sion One’ Prideare Andrew Free-

Freeman, a junior majoring
in electrical engineering and eco-

. nomics with a minor in industrial

engineering, said he plans to create
and enforce a paperless system for
ﬁnancial aid and admissions, install
a Transit Visual System that would
allow students to “access a virtual
map of the campus and to see
shuttles in real time” and improve
Blackboard by making it easier for
students and professors to corre-
spond over the Internet.

“We all can greatly beneﬁt from
the technology that is available to
us,” said Freeman. “But: we have to
utilize that technology and our re-
sources to ultimately reduce costs,
impact the environment  in-
crease the safety of students.”

‘ Freeman, the president and
‘programs chair of the National
Society of Black Engineers and a

_ mentor for PITT EXCEL, said his

paperless program, calledithe Pa-
perless Pitt Initiative, would reduce
the amount of paper faculty and
students use.

“Students are allowed 36 mil-‘

lion pages for printout each year,

. and faculty and staff have an un-

limited quota as well,” he said. “If
,we could turn everything into an
electronic system, we could deﬁ-

nitely reduce waste and save costs. 
We could also reduce the amounts

of paper used by applicants and
eliminate the ﬁnancial aid letters
sent in the mail, too.-” B
Freeman added that he wanted
to propose initiatives that can last.

“I want to put forth initiatives that s

will-remain and affect students pos-
itively for a long time to come.”

Greenwald, a junior majoring in politics
and philosophy in the Honors College and
English writing, said he hopes to pass init:ia-

' tives that will have a positive effect on the en-

vironment. He said he hopes to improve the
recycling program, increase awareness about
and possibly make free Pitt’s bike rental sys-
tem and to increase “green space” to “beau—
tify the campus.”

He said also said he wants to put a re-
newed emphasis on Pitt traditions, possibly
by creating new ones. ‘

“I have great pride in Pitt, and I love this

‘schoo ’_’ said Greenwald. “I plan to carry

that pride with me and to pass it along to

' students. I. would _like to se_e an overarching

unity. among Pitt students, and hopefully our
thoughts and ideas can help unite us.” J
Jennings, a sophomore majoring in mar-
keting and management, said she wants to
install visible shuttle stop signs to increase
efficiency and safety of the shuttle system.
These goals, when combined with Free-
man’s and Greenwald’s, contribute to the
theme of One Passion One Pride, the drive

to “tackle initiatives that affect Pitt students’ '

daily lives,” said Jennings.

Greenwald and Jennings, both members
of the Blue and Gold Society, met Freeman
through mutual friends. Jennings said they
realized they all “shared a passion for making
a difference at Pitt.” *

Greenwald agreed.

“We all come from different backgrounds

and are members over very different orga-

said. “All of our goals are different but linked ‘V
through focus on the environment and safe-

ty, and I think that shows that we’re  to

One Vision One Voice

Kevin Morrison, the current SGB al-
locations c'or_nmittee chair, Lance Bonner
and Kate Marchetti form One Vision One
Voice.

According to their Web site, www.on-
evisiononevoice.corn, the slate “will seek
to create" an environment conducive to the

expression of student voices on campus by

 the ideas and concerns of Pitt

« students to University administration and lo-

cal government representatives.”

Bonner, a junior majoring in politics and
philosophy and economics, said the slate
name ‘focuses mainly on Morrison’s presi-
dential platform of creating a “local student
lobbying group to voice the concerns of stu-
dents.” _

The name also represents the idea of hav-

A  all students and faculty united to make

Pitt better, he said.
Bonner, the president of Phi Delta Theta

November 14, 2008

fraternity and a current SGB allocations
committee member, said he plans to revise
questions on teacher surveys and make the
information from these surveys available to
Pitt students.

He also said he’d provide more resources

_ for student "organizations and raise funds for

student allocations by creating a DVD-player
rental system through Redbox, a DVD rental

, company.

Marchetti,’a sophomore majoring in po-
litical science with a dance minor, said she
wants to create a housing committee to rep-
resent students, make sure on—campus hous-
ing deadlines give students enough time to
look into off-campus housing and expand

the Outside the Classroom Curriculum to-

give students the option of earning certiﬁ-
cates through the program. '

Bonner said that',.if elected, he’d like to
see ‘a visible increase in communication -be-
tween SGB and students.

“I would like undergraduate students to
look to student government as a place of
empowerment and change, not as a hurdle

for organizations to get funding,” said Bon-.‘

net. -
“There’s recently been some expression
of dissatisfaction and disillusionment with

Student Government Board. Through com—'

munication I believe I, with Kevin and Kate,
can help SGB have a much better relation-
ship with every undergraduate student at the
university.”

Revolution
Revolution consists of presidential can-

. didate Dan Gore and board member candi-
‘dates Joseph Rendemonti and Alicia Simp-

son.

Rendemonti, a junior majoring in engi-
neering and economics with a certiﬁcate in
nuclear engineering, plans to make the re_si-
dence sign-in systems electronic, to make it
mandatory for the University to clean resi-
dence hall bathrooms on the weekends and
to reinstate the lobbying capacity of SGB.

“Some of the others runningwant to cre-
atela lobbying committee,” said Rendemonti,
“but SGB already has the ability to lobby for
students. That’s the main purpose of SGB,
to fight for the student body.” , _

Simpson, a junior‘ majoring in political
science, history and English literature, wants
to update the transportation services "to im-
prove efﬁciency, as well as collaborate with
Rendemonti on the guest sign-in system and
the restoration of lobbying to SGB.

The three juniors met when they were
freshmen and have remained friends over
the past three years,-a quality that Simpson
said sets them apart from the other slates.

“We all met separately, not through orga-

nizations,” she said. “We didn’t get
together just to run for SGB. We’re
all heavily involved on campus, and
we saw problems that we want to
ﬁx. I think that says a lot about our
slate.”

A Rendemonti said one of the
slate’s strengths is that each of its
members thinks differently.

“We’re very opinionated and‘

don’t always agree,” said Rende-
monti. “But we work well together,
and I think that’s an important
quality to have.”

Rendemonti and Simpson both
said the name “Revolution” repre-
sents the need for a complete turn-
around for SGB, a change their
slate is ready to take on.

“We wanted to get away from
airy words. We wanted something
new and different from the status
quo,” said Rendemonti. “We want
to return SGB to its truest form,
and I think our ‘name’ conveys
that.” _ '

‘ Students Always
Board member candidates
Jonathan Adams, Katlyn Jennings

and Daniel Tully form the slate
Students Always. The three said
that, if elected, they plan to make
Pitt life easier and more meaning-
ful by making students the priority
of SGB. ,

Adams, a sophomore major-
ing in mathematics and the current
SGB academic affairs committee
chair, said he wants to “advocate
on behalf of all students” by cre-
ating a scholarship fund, update
PittPortal and Courseweb to make
them more “user-friendly and ap-
pealing” and market OCC to up-
perclassmen by giving OCC credit
to more student organizations. He
said he would like to continue the
work he started on the academic
affairs committee, too.

“I always want the students to
be the focus and center of all the
decisions made,” he said. “They
are ﬂrst and foremost _my main
concern if I am elected.”

Tully, a sophomore majoring in
political science and business and
the current advocacy chairman for
the Resident Students Association,
said he wants to review the alloca-

tions process, propose an optional
laundry fee at the beginning of
each semester to eliminate the use
of quarters and the unnecessary
loss of PantherFunds, and to re-
establish accountability and acces-
sibility in SGB.

“I think that SGB should be
going out to students and actually
listening to what they have to say,”
said Tully. “We shouldn’t have to
have students ‘come to us all the
time.”

Heiadded that their slate name

fully represents their ideas for

SGB.

“It’s a very effective name, and
it’s not a copout,” he said. “Board
members who ran under it before
have gotten_ a lot of things ac-
complished. It completely fits with
what I and my slate want to do.”

Adams agreed.

“This name represents what
our central focus is: students,” he
said. “My slate brings a lot of dif-
ferent opinions to ‘the table, but
that’s good. We can get more ac-
complished and can cover more

ground.”

Students First

Students First consists of cur-
rent board member and presiden-
tial candidate Amanda Reed, cur-
rent board member Nila Devanath

- and Charlie Shull.

According to the slate’s descrip-
tion on Facebook, “Students First”
will work to “end usual divisions in
the SGB and on campus so that all
students, including those tradition-
ally ignored, are given a seat at the

' table.”

Devanath, a junior majoring
in neuroscience, psychology and
sociology with a minor in chem-
istry and an Asian studies certifi-
cate, said she chose to run again to
make SGB to be more accessible
to students and to complete the
work she has already started.

“SGB is a mystery to a lot of
students,” said Devanath. “Some
students don’t even know what
SGB is or who the board members
are, and as a board member, that
really bothers me.” i

Devanath said she hopes to ﬁn-
ish her work with SafeRider and

the new exam policy, which would
allow students to reschedule their
back—to-back finals. She said she
wants to work with the University
Registrar to abolish a policy that
prohibits‘ student organizations
from reserving rooms in buildings
where classes are regularly held,
too.

According to their group de-
scription on Facebook, Shull, a
junior majoring in politics and phi-
losophy, plans to add an online fo-
rum to my.pitt.edu that will enable
students to communicate more
easily and give SGB feedback on
issues being addressed. Accord-

ing to the site, he would also like -

to eliminate rental fees for space
available for students on campus.

Devanath said she and her slate-
mates ultimately want to represent
the students and make them first in
all decisions.

“We want to change the culture
of SGB and the University to be
more responsive to students and
make sure they are the foremost
consideration in SGB and admin-
istrative decisions,” she said.

Palin Africa report proves news media's irresponsibility

Not long after the election
ended, Fox News Channel re-
ported that an anonymous source
from the McCain campaign said
Sarah Palin did not know Africa
was a continent.

It was a shocking post-elec-
tion revelation that undoubt-
edly made Americans across
the country breathe a collective
sigh of relief. Closely following
Fox News, MSNBC, The New
Republic and The Los Angeles

- Times -quickly afﬁrmed the in-

formation, and re soon the
P
blogosphere was abuzz over Pa-
lin’s su osedi oranceﬁ
PP 8“
A “Martin Eisenstadt” was
found to be the source of the

claim. MSNBC anchor David
Schuster said on Monday that
Eisenstadt is “a McCain policy
adviser, who has come forward

today to identify himself as the.

source of the leaks,” according

. to The New York Times.

There’s just one small prob-
lem. Eisenstadt is not a McCain
policy adviser. He doesn’t even
exist. ' '

Martin Eisenstadt is a char-

’ acter developed by independent
ﬁlmmakers Eitan Gorlin and
Dan Mirvish. The two created
Eisenstadt to help promote a TV
show about the character. Eisen-
stadt has his very own blog and
video clips on YouTube.

The ﬁlmmakers said, accord-
ing to the Times, that they were
not responsible for leaking the

Africa claim through Eisenstadt, '

however. Indeed, the claim might
very well be true.

But that’s not the issue. If this
controversy has proven anything,
it’s the irresponsibility of the
news media, which, despite the
questionable source, reported
the claim. -

Twenty-four-hour news net-
works, news Web sites and blogs
seem to ﬁnd it more important
to be the first to report, rather
than to report accurately With
reporting neglected, journalists

‘ turn to the media’s echo chamber

—— reporting what their competi-
tors are reporting without doing
the necessary fact checking.

As a result, sensationalist sto-

ries — like this one regarding Pa— '
‘ lin and last month’s story about

student and McCain campaign
volunteer Ashley Todd’s false en-

counter with a B-carving robber

in Bloomﬁeld — end up domi-
nating news coverage.

Where does this leave the
viewers, listeners and readers
who rely on the news media for
information? After such incidents
of poor reporting, it is becoming
more and more difﬁcult to trust
these outrageous news stories.

Reports, editors, anchorsand

journalists‘ have an obligation
to report the facts and only the
facts. After the Eisenstadt inci-
dent was proven to be a hoax,
MSNBC swiftly issued a_ cor-

rection and The New Republic

posted on its Web site that the
source of the Palin Africa story
was a fraud. ’

But such problematic stories
shouldn’t ever make it to the
press or the airwaves in the-ﬁrst
place. The duty of each and ev-
ery journalist is to make sure of
that. -

As for Sarah Palin and wheth- '

er she knows if Africa is a con-
tinent, we’ll check and re-check
our sources and get back to you.

no" doubt that people like Giles Howard are sincere in their "ﬁerce opposition to
the passage of Prop 8, and I applaud him and others like him for his opposition.
However, I think he’s also ﬁindamentally misinformed, both in pronouncing, like
so many other overeager white libeials excited about Baiack Obama, the death-
knellof racismin theUrlited States (we, accordingtohim,“defeated the racism of
our fathers,” and the election represented, at least for blacks, “the pinnacle of the
civil rights struggle”) and in his puuling insistence that the black community bears
the brunt of the responsibility for the passage of Prop 8.

In assigningblame, he says not oneword about the rail culprits for the 
passage, namely fundamentalist  wealthy conservatives and Republicans,

iFashioi1stas rethink shopping

10

by Julia Nauer
Colummlu‘

The “fashionista” is dead.
No longer is it cool to spend ridiculous
amounts of money on frivolous seasonal

-, buys, especially on high—ticket items.

According to a New York Times article
by Natasha’ Singer, “The free—spending style
hounds formerly known as ‘fashionistas’ are
rebranding themselves.” Welcome to the era
of the “recessionista.” A term coined by
various newspapers and Web sites to deﬁne
the stylish woman on a budget, the word has
been viewed as a public relations technique
by some. However, the recessionista can
teach us many important style lessons.

And it might sound contradictory, but

~\_.—.~§..hard times make for good shopping—— good,

ca"-"_.

ﬂy...

cheap shopping, that is. Jennifer Saranow
and Christopher Lawton of the Wall Street
Journal write that “sharp falloff in consumer
spending that has forced full price stores to
unload excess inventory” is in your favor.

This brings me to my ﬁrst recessionista,

tipzi Shop at discounters like Marshall’s, 
Maxx, Fi1ene’s Basement, DSW shoe stores
and other outlets. Shopping at these off—retail
stores requires a good deal of picking through

unwanted pieces and a plethora of patience,

 

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

but it’s worth it. .
A lot of these stores carry top brands at
steeply reduced prices, making it one of the

easiest ways to get the real thing for a lot less. .

And don’t forget about just shopping the sale
rack in your favorite full price stores. As new
inventory comes in, and consumers haven’t
bought up the old stuff, something has to be
done to make room, so take advantage.
Secondly, look for high—end brands with

ilower-end diffusion lines. Target is always the

ﬁrst retailer that comes to mind because of
its partnerships with designer Isaac Mizrahi,
handbag designer Anya Hindmarch, make-up
artists Jemma; Kidd and Sonia Kashuk and
the GO International collections.

Many other mass retailers offer the same
kinds of lower‘-priced lines. Kohl’s features
Vera Wang’s  Vera, which retails
for a fraction of the iéhst of her ready—to—
wear lines but comes with the same signature
style. And H&.M collaborates with a number
of designers to produce limited edition col-
lections, making high fashion affordable for

Third, recessionistas know ‘how to reduce,
reuse and recycle. Go shopping in your own
closet for pieces that can be worn in new ways.
Sometimes all it takes is just a quick peek at
everything you already have to get inspired.

Pairing different pieces together also forces
you" to be creative with your clothes. Who
knows what fabulous outﬁts you’ll come up
.with? And remember: You can always take
pieces to be tailored if the ﬁt is just a little
out of date.

Fourth, while you’re looking through your
closet, I’m sure you’ll ﬁnd at least one time-
less piece of good quality clothing. Try to
incorporate it into your wardrobe as much
as you can. Good shoes can transform an
old shirt, a nice bag can offset your tattered
jeans, and a classic coat can hide everything
underneath. Attempt to mix at least one ‘good
quality piece into each outﬁt, and it’s doubtful
anyone will think that your cheap chic ﬁnds
are cheap.

Fifth, shop vintage. So many styles popular
today are inspired by past decades, so why not
go straight to the source? Instead of paying
full price for something inspired by a trend
from the ’50s, go out there and actually ﬁnd
something_ from the ’50s for half the price.

And if you can’t ﬁnd the perfect outﬁt, you
can always fall back on your face. Apparently,
as the economy plummets, cosmetic sales go
through the roof ‘The New York Times said
one item’s sales are up 40 percent: lipstick.

Recessionistas everywheremust be smil-

Berenato, Panthers

Pitt senior Xenia Stewart goes up for a layup against the Premier
Players Tuesday night. Stewart will start for the Panthers on Sunday.

by Emily Steiner

Staﬁ’ W/rite/'

Taking on a highly ranked
team this early in the season might
seem like andifﬁcult feat, but Pitt
women’s basketball coach Agnus
Berenato believes her team can
handle the challenge.

‘ Coming off two exhibition
wins, Pitt looks to continue on
the road as it starts its regular
season in Baton Rouge, La., this
weekend at the State Farm Tip-
Off Classic. The Panthers take
on the No. 11 Texas A&M Aggies
on Sunday. A

To Berenato, the outcome of
the game _won’t be about how the
Panthers handle Texas A&M, but
how well Pitt plays as Pitt.

“We have to really worry about
us,” said Berenato. “We know we
can compete. We’re conﬁdent
in our team’s ability to not only
compete with Texas A&M, but to
defeat them.”

This is the first time the Pan-
thers have been invited to the

prestigious tournament, but it’s a
big deal on more levels. They’re
one of four teams to open the
entire NCAA women’s basketball
season, and the event is happen-
ing on national television.

Pitt’s game will air on ESPN
on Sunday at 6 p.m.

But Pitt wants people to know
it deserves to be there.

“We feel we’re capable of
competing against the best,” said
Berenato. “This is a huge game
for us. We’re going in with the
mentality that we can compete
with them. We’re not just happy
to be invited there, but we’re go-
ing there to win. That’s my men-
tality, and I know that’s my team’s
mentality.” 1

‘‘We’re just really happy to see
where we are at this point. It’s
always better to find out earlier
rather than later.”

Pitt is currently unranked in
the preseason AP poll but gar-
nered a No. 23—ranking in the

opening USA Today/ ESPN poll. . -

face challenge in Aggies

Last season, the Aggies went
29-8, won the Big 12 tournament
and went to the Elite Eight, losing
to Tennessee. They’re bringing
back several starters, including se-
nior Takia Starks, their two—time
All-Big 12 Conference First Team. .
member who averages 16 points
and four rebounds per game.

Starks has already been added
to the preseason watch list for the
State Farm Wade Trophy Divi-
sion I Player of the Year and pre-7- V
season first team All-American.

“She has a scorer’s mentality,”
said Berenato of Starks. “She def-
initely is the kid who helped take
them to the Elite Eight.”

The other Aggie that Pitt is‘—-jg,
looking out for is senior Dan-
ielle Gant, who is described by
her coach, Gary Blair, as “by far
the best finisher we have on our
team.”

Pitt will start veterans Shavon-“:. '’
