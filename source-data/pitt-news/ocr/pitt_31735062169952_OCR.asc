by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor
The University haAs recently signed a ten year contract for
the leasing of a 36-unit Shadyside apartment building to house
graduate students “only” for the 1969-70 school year, The Pitt

News has learned.

The building. known as the
Koch Apartments, is located at
5115-5127 Centre Ave., near
the Shadyside Hospital.

The contract was worked out
with the Prudential Real Estate
Company. officed in the Frick
Building. Downtown Pittsburgh.
but David Smith. the University
treasurer. declined to issue a fin-
ancial statement as to what the
University was paying for the
lease. ‘He did say. “The Univer-
sity is paying a flat fee for the
year." the first of a ten year work-
ing agreement with the real es-
tate company. A

University Housing Director
David Ginevan. in a letter (dated
Feb. 27) sent to all graduate resi-
dence of Tower C. said “Al-
though a definite ‘rental figure
has not yet been established. it is
anticipated that it will approxi-
mate the current rate charged for

A accommodations in Tower C."

Next year. the University room
and board for Tower C will be
$585. Board costs $250. and room
costs $335.

‘According to Ginevan. four
graduate students will occupy
each of the 36 apartments in the
building. (Each grad student ne-

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

gotiates his own room contract.
according to University policy. )

If the first year of graduate res-
idence works out with little or no
trouble, Howard Engelberg, Jr.,
property manager of the real es-
tate company says, “It could be
just the beginning of future deals
with the University.”

“If it flops.." he says. “the Uni-
‘ versity just has a ten year lease.“

Technically. according to En-
gelberg the real estate company
will have no immediate income
“coming-in." He says the com-
-pany will make the "initial cash
outlay in terms of remodeling."

As far as the conditions of the
facilities is concerned. Engelberg
said:

—“Some students will get gems
for apartments, while otherslwill
get just new baths.

Senators ‘Criticize’

  Pos<var’s Aid Request

_ Harrisburg rebuffed‘ the University recently, and tried to
slash the Chancellor’s request for state aid with accolades about

Money Problems

student unrest- here.

When Chancellor Wesley Posvar ‘stood before the State
Senate Appropriations Committee this week. he requested $41.3
state aid to support what he showed to be “a 12 percent in-
crease in enrollment and substantial increases in our tremendously
urgent problems for the disadvantaged."

The immediate response from several senators was-a criticism

of the amount requested in view
of the recent Teach-Ins. and the
discredidation of ROTC.

“We don’t have to give you any '

money,” said -Sen.” Clarence D.
Bell (Chester-Rep.), in response
to Dr. Posvar’s statement that he
intends to allow-students the right
of freedom of speech.

A senator opposed to the Chan-
cellor’s request for reasons other
than University policy. Sen. ‘D.
Elmer Hawbaker '1 Merc'erburg-
Rep, iremarked. “It is utterly un-
conscionable to me to impose a
tax on a bricklayer to help edu-
cate a dentist, or for that matter.
a doctor. lawyer. architect. or en-
gineer.“

The senator. estimating that the
taxpayers provide $2.000 per stu-

‘ Communication ’
Group Invited to Form

William H.iRea. chairman of
the University‘s Board of Trus-
tees. and Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar said-Thursday that they
are inviting the formation of a
committee 'of students. faculty.
administrators and trustees to
study and recommend improve-
ments in both communication and
organization in the University.

They made the announcement
during a meeting with a group of
students invited by the chancellor
and the board chairman.

Mr. Rea said he hoped that the

 

committee will recommend long-
range improvements. As an inter-
im measure, Mr. Rea said, he will
also recommend that a number
of members of the Board of Trus-
tees meet on an informal basis in
the near future to discuss these
issues with more representatives
of the student body.

Thursday’s meeting lasted for
two hours and covered a variety
of issues involving communica-
tion between students. faculty and
trustees, as well as the organiza-
tion of the university. -

 

dent each year. asked. “Do they
have a degree of indebtedness to
the taxpayers of Pennsylvania?”

The Chancellor was questioned
about his contention that an in-
crease in tuition would be an un-
due hardship on. modest-mean
families. Sen. Preston Davis said
that at the University of Pennsyl-
vania “the tuition is. $2,150 a year
and 50 per cent of the students
are from families of modest
means.” ’

Dr. Posvar‘s report to the com-
mittee showed a decrease in the
relative number of students from
families of less than $10,000 a
year. from 86.9 per cent during
the first year of state-relatedness.
to 82.2 per cent in 1967-68 and
81.4 per cent during the current
year.

The Chancellor assigned the
reason for the drop to “general
increases in income levels and the
$50 per term increase in tuition."

The Chancellor, in addition to
justifying the University’s need
for aid, attempted to defend the
University’s need for autonomy.

Sen. Bell introduced the ques-
tion of the removal of ROTC cred-
it. maintaining that the Universi-
ty had succumbed to the demands
of a minority.

Posvar replied that "the faculty

‘has jurisdiction over the content
of curriculum" and that in remov-
ing ROTC credit “they were act-
ing within their prerogatives." .

While stating his own personal
support of ROTC programs, the
Chancellor remarked that ROTC
would “continue to -thrive” even

without academic status and cred-‘ »

its. » .
A. j A A(Con.tAir_nted onAPq.ge_1A6A) .-

—“Presently,' in the basement
there are two coin-operated wash-
ers and two dryers servicing the
36 unit apartment house. As it
stands right now, the building
works fine. But if more are need-
ed, we will put in more.” ‘

In terms of profit for the com-
pany. Engelberg said. “It's lu-
crative.".

‘fit’ the students keep invline.
and since they will be graduate
students. the apartment will pros-
per." he said. If they tear it apart.
it will be unprofitable. It’s a ‘me-
dium damage‘ situation."

(Indications from present build-
ing tenants, who must leave the
premises between May I and Aug.
30, are that the average rent for
each apartment will be more than

double.

(Also, one married couple from

the Koch apartments complex tele--

phoned. The Pitt News and said
the building may require “quite
a bit” of remodeling. “lt may also
need to be fumigated in the base-
ment,” they said.)

“We’re interested basically in
a fairly long term lease,”. Engel-

A berg said.

some traumatic budget concerns at the

ate Appropriations Committee, it

‘I7 J seems, are using the University appro-

-i-
— :-:‘

' ‘tag on such a system '

priation — $41.3 million — as political
blackmail in their attempt to get Chan-
cellor Posvar to alter policy concern-
ing ROTC and student disorders.

The men sitting on the Appropria-
tions Committee threatened to cut this
years budget request by 25 per cent.
This would cause educational regres-
sion. Dr. Posvar, nevertheless, has up-
held the right of the faculty to make
curricular judgments concerning
ROTC and has relentlesslv argued" in

"favor of the University’s right to set-
its own disciplinary guidelines. All of
this, of course, has made. Dr. Posvar
the whipping boy of the State senate.

Unlike Dr. Posvar, Penn State Pres-
ident Dr. Erik Walker is playing the
Senate’s game. Instead of upholding
the right of his institution’s autonomy

‘ h before the Senate Appropriations Com-

mittee, Dr. Walker publicly took the
Hesburgh tough line attitude toward

: A ‘student unrest.

Such “two-faced” action, pleased
some of the members of the commit-
tee. Dr. Wall/ier’s antics may improve
the chancesof procuring a good ap-
propriation for Penn State. But it
seems he has left the desires and wish-
es of the Penn State students in the

this, the ‘Chancellor has upheld his
strong opposition to the Fleming bill.

.In short, he has defended the rights of

faculty and students‘ at this University
in spite of the tremendous financial
pressures being exerted by the State
Senate.

It is a said commentary on our leg-
islative process when politics begins
to block educational process. When it
becomes more important for a legis-
lative agent to knock the free and open

' nature of a university community than

to support progress in higher educa-
tion. it is time for us educate the pub-
lic concerning the role of a university
in the society.

A university should not be a hav-
en of censorship and unbalanced rea-
soning; it should not be a convent ded-
icated to the production of computer-

ized alumni. In spite of some legisla-

tive attitudes, the University must re-
main a haven of free expression where
ideas can be expressedwith every de-
gree of intellectual freedom.

Many members of the legislature
question the validity of academic free-
dom—the freedom of a university to
make its own curricular decisions. But
without “academic freedom,” a uni-
versity regresses into a meat process-
ing plant that produces flank steak
citizens who only succeed in becom-
ing complacent suburbians.

While this newspaper has rarely
complimented the administration. we
give Dr. Posvar our support in his ef-
fort to protect the institutional rights
of the University.

Staff News Writer

Last Sunday night I covered a panel
discussion on the proposed Sentinel mis-
sile system. This discussion left me with
many mixed feelings. not only on whether
or not the system should be installed. but
on the state of the world in general.

(The Sentinel is an anti—ballistic mis-
sile system (ABM).-
which. if installed.
would provide limited
protection against a nu-
clear attack. The price

would be from $6 to $10
billion.)

Afterzhearing a tech-
nical briefing on the
subject. the discussion ‘
turned to the question. “Should we install
the Sentinel?"

LOOKING AT THIS question one way.
I suppose we all want the U.S. to be the
best at whatever it tries, including nuclear
warfare. And if the AMB is needed to
keep the U.S. from being stepped on. then.
by Geroge. let’s get it.

But think again—$10 billion! Think of
all the lakes, parks, and forests that could
be developed and maintained with those
funds. Think of all the hungry families
we could feed. '

But I don't haveanything against
spending money.‘ _

_ I do have something against senseless
loss of life, bloodshed. and mass deaths

 

becausegtwo governments cannot agree. 1
do have something against nuclear war-
fare.

AND-I DEFINITELY have something
against the way this whole stupid world
seems to be operating — a,world full of
cheating. prejudice. and hate. . .

Hate that makes one great nation set
up elaborate defense -machinery against
another . . . Hate that would make one
great nation go to a disastrous war against
another. with resulting deaths that could
run into the millions. and possibly the hun-
dreds of millions . . .

Evidently. no one knows or remem-
bers those screwy old ideas about how one
man is supposed to respect and love an-
other.

All right. go ahead and spend the mon-
ey. Install the system and keep the coun-
try secure against attack. But. please. can't
we do something about correcting the
giant problems in the world‘?

Wouldn‘t the best systemlbe a system
where the world is friendly and no protec-
tion against warring neighbors is neces-
sary?

I guess we need the ABM. But I wish
we didn't.

Perhaps I‘m being overly idealistic.
but I think we really can have world peace
if everyone tries hard. And that includes
university students. Hate and prejudice
must be wiped off the face of the earth if
everyone is to live happily ever after. The

University of Pittsburgh is a good place
- to start. . ~

by GERALD KAUFMAN

(Editor's Note: Mr. Kaufman is a state
representative in the House. This is his
statement before the State Government Com-
mittee, March 7, 7969.)

Our young men and women feel a frus-
tration because they are concerned with
the problems of inquality. injustice and
blight which plague our cities. and yet
they are not able to take part in mandating
the decisions intending to ameliorate these
conditions. ' O

I beleive that the youth of this genera-
tion have a greater commitment to cons-

tructive social change than any other in _

our history. This commitment is so strong
that it has needed and will continue to
need an’ outlet for expression. In recent
months. this outlet has of necessity. been
centered in activism on our high school
and college campuses.

Starting with a relatively small group
of students. but growing ‘rapidly in ‘num-
bers with each passing day. this activism
has been expressedin various forms rang-
ing from the “acceptable negotiations to
the "intolerable" takeover of buildings and
physical violence. .

THE REACTION of our nation has
been swift and typical. In the majority of
cases. we react against the students — by
calling for the police. calling for investi-
gations._ and assuming that the campus dis-
orders are an organized subversive plot.

What we don't do is listen to what the '

young people are telling us. We do not
realize that these are the same young peo-
ple who. only six or eight months ago were
being praised for shaving. getting haircuts.

Columbia. Duke. Brandeis. What prob-
lems does the University share with these
centers of student dissent?

Columbia‘s difficulties began last April.
when students and blacks from nearby Har-
lem met to protest plans for a gymnasium
in a local park. The gynasium demonstra-
tion acted as a catalyst ,'
for general student_ .
power demands. Even-'
tually. Columbia was '
paralyzed for two weeks
and more than 500 stu- -
dents were arrested.

A RECENT article in
the Black Action News '
claims that the Univer— '
sity of Pittsburgh forced
black residents and black operated busi-
nesses off land now designated for'ath-
letic practice fields.

The Black Action News demands that
the University “should abandon all ideas
of using this land for playing fields." and

   

wants the University to "demand of the.

General State Authority that the land be
given back to the black community with
full title. through a black co-op.'' \

Perhaps with student support. as at Col-
umbia. black demands for land could es-
calate into trouble here.

There are those who argue that noth-
ing can happen here. "Students are too
apathetic." they say. but non-participants
at a Duke protest recently became activ-
ists.

Duke. a southern university. has few
black students. but 70 blacks succeeded in
occupying several campus buildings. Af-
ter the blacks left the buildings. police
unexplainably tear gassed and charged
a crowd of white bystanders. The next
day. one thousand white students joined
the blacks in demonstrating. Police agita-
tion turned bystanders into participants.

The same thing happened on a smaller

scale here last April. when city police

McCarthy or Robert Kennedy.

Instead. as is wont in America. we let
their action obliterate the content of what
they have to say.

If you will remember that the last Dem-
ocratic primaries, or even further back, the
southern voter registration drives of 1964.
you will recall that it was young people
who got millions of older Americans in-
volved in their government.

. But they were, expected to do-this. and r

then sit back quietly while the principles
they worked for were rendered meaning-
less by political machinery that cannot and
will not respond.

WHAT WE ARE seeing in our schools
is an indication that the days of fruitless
involvement of youngsters are behind us.
If we continue to eliminate them from the
major decisions that affect their lives. we
are in for more disruptions.

Our elected officials make decisions
that directly affect the lives of our young
adults. Where such decisions are made.
those affected must have a voice in their
making. No other approach is consistent
with justice. fairness or decency.

If we lower the voting age to 18. I feel
strongly that this nation will receive a dou-
ble benefit.

—The idealism of our youth will renew
our commitment to building the just so-
ciety to which we pay lip service. and

-—The tremendous creative energies of
our youth can be channeled to the Demo-
cratic political process. rather than to dem-
onstrations and disruptions.

 

clubbed and’ maced’ students during the

so-called "Second Annual Spring Riots.“

BRANDEIS APPEALED to reason
when black ‘students occupied the school's
communication center. Morris Abram.
president of Brandeis. asked university of-
ficials. trustees. and students to let Bran-
deis handle its own problems without po-
lice, interference. The sit-in ended when

the blacks surrendered the building and_

decided to press their demands in other
ways.

Notre Dame -can give the University
and the Pennsylvania legislature a lesson
in something other than football. Notre
Dame plans to give demonstrators I5 min-
utes to stop forceful actions. After that.
they may be expelled from school. The
plan may be drastic. but Notre Dame
wants to solve its own problems.

Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh. Notre
Dames president. in a recent New York
Times article stressed the urgency of over-
whelming campus support for his policy
lest public revulsion against student riots
bring --a suppression of the liberty and au-
tonomy that are the lifeblood of a univer-
sity.“

Father Hesburgh added that "it may
well lead to a rebirth of fascism unless we.
ourselves. are ready to take a stand for
what is right for us." The last thing need-
ed is “repressive legislation or over-reac-
tion in its many forms."

The University shares many problems
with other universities. and it is possible
for more difficulty to arise here. This se--

* mester. we have seen how opposing inter-

ests have irritated each other.

Sen. Robert Fleming. angered in part
by the sit-in at the Computer Center. in-
troduced legislation to restrict free expres-
sion on college campuses. Students. in turn.
are angry with Fleming. as indicated by
last Friday's teach-in. .

Perhaps better communications and ef-'

forts between and by students. Universi-
ty officials. and legislators can help pre-
vent future problems here. -

Language Instructor Views Requirement

Editor. The Pitt News:

This is a copy of a letter sent to the Chan-
cellor and several Administrators and Faculty
Members. I would appreciate if you publish
it, as it is, in the next issue of the Pitt News.

After reading and listening to the opin-
ions that several University officials have
expressed on the language requirement.
1, as a student who has been on this cam-
pus for five years, and who has directly
dealt with this issue. would like to make
several observations.

During my stay‘ in the Towers as an un-
dergraduate. I had the opportunity to help
several American students with their
Spanish, and atlthe same time become
aware of their complaints. For four years
we heard complaints about the way lan-
guages were taught. but the Administra-
tion seemed to ignore them. and the sys-
tem prevailed.

It seems illogical that after these years
of ignoring the requests for a change in the

’ system, the administration now appears

ready and willing to directly abolish the
language requirement. '

Even more surprising are the comments
made by some University officials who
do not see the point in having languages
as part of the liberal arts program. Just
considering the derivation of the ‘word uni-
versity, universitas. it is inconceivable
to pretend to have liberal arts graduates
from a major university who do not have

some knowledge of a foreign language and‘

culture.

In addition to these academic aspects.
foreign languages and cultures should
play a role in the universities of this coun-
try because of the position of the United
States in relation to the rest of the world.

Americans are known as being extreme- ’

ly provincial. and yet. politically speak-
ing. they are supposedly the number one
country in the world. These two qualities
are incompatible. A nation that has so
many interests abroad and that wants to
exert influence on so many countries.
first of all needs to understand the people
of these countries.

For this. there is no better place to start
than by understanding their cultures. es-
pecially their languages.

The past administrations of the United
States, especially since" John F. Kennedy.
have worked to improve this situation.
Some improvement has been made, but we

are still far from a satisfactory stage..

For instance. frankly speaking. one of
the main reasons for the failure of the
University of Pittsburgh Project in my
home country, Ecuador. was the language
and culture barrier. Part of the planning
in this project was utopian because it did
not correspond to the reality of the Ecua-
dorian culture. I ’

And, on the other hand. several of the
Pitt Faculty members, due to the language
gap, became useless persons. simple tour-
ists. and their attitude and situation was
a main factor in causing opposition from

. many Ecuadorians. '

Knowledge of foreign languages and cul-
tures is something that cannot be impro-
vised. When confronted with the neces-
sity. a person cannot acquire these skills.
By then it is too late. This knowledge has
to come as a part of the high school and col-
lege programs if it is going to be useful.

In view of these facts, it was ironic to

. compare the statement made by the Chief

of the U.S.S.R. Mission now visiting Lat-

Letters to the “How Our Readers
See It” department must carry the full
name of the writer and the signee’s

typewritten, — triple-spaced and 200
words or less.

tion and editing by the editors. Any let-
ter which tends to libel or falls outside
the rules of journalistic ethnics will not
be published.

in America. with the ones made by Dean ‘

Kehl and Dean Halliday which appeared
in the Pitt News recently. The Soviet Of-
ficial expressed to a group of Latins (El
Comercio, Quito. Ecuador» that the edu-
cational system of the U.S.S.R. isgiving
special emphasis to the study of their lan-
guage and culture, so that the Soviet’s new
relationship with Latin America would
be more effective. Dean "Kehl and Dean
Halliday. on the other hand. openly oppose
languages in this University.

Is the United States giving up its inter-
ests in foreign lands? Is the United States
willing to step aside and let other major
powers of the world tae over? If it -is not
at the college level, where are Americans,
for their own benefit. going to become fa-
miliar with 'foreign languages and cul-
tures? Don’t these foreign affairs play a
very important role in American political
and economic systems?

President Nixon is sending Nelson Rock-
efeller on a special mission to Latin Am-
erica, even though he knows that Rockefel-
ler will face very difficult and dangerous
moments due to the fact’ that in Latin coun-
tries he represents, more than anybody,
foreign monopolies. Even though Rocke-
feller may be risking his life, and,even

though his designation is debatable for,.iii"ii
some people, the main reasons that he’; 
has in his favor, according to a recent? j’;
Washington Post editorial, are the facts’. ,,
that he is familiar with the culture and”
he speaks Spanish. And yet. some Univer- . -
sity officials consider foreign languages » 
insignificant enough to be abolished! . 

Last fall I started my graduate work in . 
Latin American Studies and Spanish Amer- , 
ican Literature, and,became a graduate,’ 
assistant of the Spanish Department. My." "
experience teaching Spanish has shown me;  
that the present program does not give” 
the student the opportunity ‘I30 develop the V 

ability to communicate.

This system could be improved by giving.
a different orientation to these courses and l 

by giving the students another choice be-
sides the literature that they’ receive at
levels 3 and 4. Also, with different mater-

ials, levels 1 and 2 could be improved and 

perhaps reduced to four days a week.

These courses. in my opinion, should 
be graded on a satisfactory-unsatisfac-— 
tory basis. In this way the courses would. 

become more appealing and valuable to
the students.

We should not forget that liberty is'not _:

license. Administrators and students

should not yield to demands blindly. In- 
stead, they should strive for constructive‘

action. Whatever the final solution is, the
language requirement must be changed,

not destroyed. The role that the United ‘ ..
States plays in world affairs can not allow .  .

its major educational institutions to ignore

the importance of the study of foreign llan-I ii‘:

guages and cultures.

Jose J. Cisneros

Graduate Assistant Hg‘

Abolish ‘Requirement’ - - — It’s A Crime

Editor, The Pitt News:

No defense of the language
requirement can withstand an
attack of cold reason. ‘

Arguments are often made con-
cerning the utility of the lan-
guage requirement. True, if a Pitt
student found himself on a job in
a foreign country, an ability to
speak the language would be of
benefit. But how many of us will
take jobs in foreign countries?

Answer: A small few.

Should we all be required to
take four terms of igloo building
because we might someday find
ourselves in the Arctic or the
Antarctic and be in need of a place
to live?

Answer: If we-follow the logic
of the defenders of the language
requirement, we certainly
should!

If someone has to know how to
sb'é'ak a foreign language because
of his job, he more than likely
will be taught how to speak the
language by those for whom he
works. He will be taught how to
speak the language well enough
to get along in everyday contacts.

Even if fulfilling the language
requirement did result in a speak-
ing command of another tonge
— and it most certainly does not-
only a small segment of «the stu-
dents would have opportunity to
‘make use of their ability. The rest
would soon forget it because of
disuse. and upon them. it would
have been wasted.

In defense of the language re-
quirement, it has been contended
that study of a foreign language is
necessary for one to learn about
the culture and the literature of
another country. But if one wants

to know something of the culture . -

of a particular country. he’d be
better off to take appropriate

anthropology or sociology cours- .

es, rather than learn how to con-
jugate a few verbs of the language
spoken in the country about whose
culture he wishes to enlighten
himself.“  ’ - ~

   

‘ guage.

And if he wants to study a coun-
try’s literature. it is not neces-
sary for him to learn the language
in which that literature is writ-
ten when it isso very easy to ob-
tain well-done English transla-
tions of foreign literature.

But the most ridiculous, the
most empty—headed defense of the
language requirement. is that the
ability of people to communicate
in each others’ languages some-
how develops an atmosphere of
compassion. fosters understand-
ing. and prevents war.

Those who advocate the lan-
guage requirement on the grounds
that'fluency in more than one lan-
guage is conducive to peace con-
veniently forget that Europe.
that region of multilingual clean-
ing -women, that place where
great segments of the popula-
tions speak more than one lan-
has throughout its his-
tory been wracked with wars
fought with no lack of relish
-among its member nations.

But perhaps the best example
to destroy the contention that
the ability of people to speak the
same language will necessar'I:v

make for a peaceful atmosphere
is provided by the American Civil
War. in which both sides, as Ab-
raham Lincoln observed, not only
spoke the same language but also
read the same Bible and prayed
to the same God.

The most sacred trust of a col-
lege education is the preservation
of the intellectual integrity of
the students. Forcing students
to take useless courses for no

reason — other than perhaps a

sadistic desire to see them suf-
fer needless work ~ is an attack
upon their dignity and their intel-
lectual integrity. The human in-
telligence is the most precious
of things. It is a crime to force
the human mind to perform the
unamusing trick of memorizing

and regurgitating foreign words '

which will soon be forgotten.

Let the administration be, as
was Thomas Jefferson: “opposed

to every form of tyranny over the S

guage requirement at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh! ! ! l !

Soph Raps ‘Inscrutable Rap’.

Editor, The.Pitt News:

While walking through the Tow-
er’s Lobby, I chanced to notice
that the new Pitt News and was
puzzled by the following headl
line: “College Editors Rap with
Legislators.” Rap? Expecting a

tale of some bloody brawl or some

such thing I read further only to
discover that some editors of the
newspapers of various colleges
had been briefed by some Penn-
sylvania State legislators.

What about “rap?“ What did
this word have to do with what

transpired in Harrisburg? I was

baffled.

To put an end to my bewilder-
ment, I immediately consulted
my trusty Webster’s Collegiate

Dictionary.

 

It’s frustrating thing, not to
find a word in one’s Webster’s

Collegiate. However, I did not '

despair. After all, “eschaton” is
not be found in that lexicon, ei-
ther.

I asked several of my acquain-
tances and I encountered a fel-
low, who — to my surprise —— mere-
ly chuckled and uttered some un-
fathomable reply which sounded
like: “Man, you really aren't with
it at all, are you?” _

As yet‘, I, do
not know, and would not even haz-
ard a guess. My only wish is that
the Pitt News would print ade-
quate definitions which corres-
pond to such insrrutable words.

with Mr. DeYoung. \

Dear Mr. DeYoung:

There is evidence that we of the
mid—-twentieth century are
engaged in a social and
economic revolution equal in
magnitude and in impact to the
industrial revolution of the
mid-eighteenth century.
Instead of hand tools giving
way to power-driven machines,
though, man-run machines are
giving way to computer-run
machines. Many phases of
business and industry which
once depended exclusively on
human effort (e.g. accounting,
quality control, purchase
ordering, and even sales) are -
already showing the intrusion
of computers. Someday,
machine-computer-computer-
machine complexes may
eliminate most human
participation in industry.

Such change will produce
several significant results
(they've already started!) :

1 .' The rapid decrease in need
for unskilled and semi-skilled
labor. ‘

2. The ever accelerating need to
retrain personnel to move

from obsolete jobs to newly
created ones.

3. The requirement that .
those frequent technological
retraining periods be with
full pay (i.e. elimination of a
job should not produce
unemployment).

4. The need for-economic
stability with nearly 100% of our
labor force employed. (The
need for 3%-5% unemployment
is not directly evident.)

5. The increasing emphasis on
service industries. As
proportionately more people.
are involved in research,
teaching, counseling, etc.,

our society will lose its
production-consumption basis.

What are you, an American
businessman, doing to avoid
massive social disorientation,
such as was experienced in
nineteenth century England in
the wake of the industrial
revolution, as we shift to a
service-oriented society? How
will the excluded millions
start to feel and to become a
benefiting part of the changing
society? , ’

Yours truly,

 t g_.,

Massive soeial disorientation

Dear Mr. Bookspan:

The fear that human beings will
be made obsolete by machines,
and the prospects of a resulting
massive social disorientation,
has prompted cries of alarm
since the harnessing of steam
power and the invention of the
mechanical loom.

These traditional forebodings
have become increasingly vocal
in some quarters with the
continuously wider applications
of automation. As the litany
goes: Automated machines
controlled by computers are
self-adjusting, repairing, and '
programming without human
labor. . . can outperform any
worker at the task undertaken,
and likely outthink him as well.
lnevitably more and more
workers will be replaced with
each progressively
sophisticated generation of
computer complexes. and
unemployment will rise to
crisis proportions.

Historically these fears have
proven groundless, and there

is no reasonable basis to
conclude any catastrophic
developments in the future with
increased automation.

There is no end tothe needs of
human beings as they have '
more disposal income and more
leisure time. Without
automation, we would not have
had the capacity to fulfill the
demands of a constantly
increasing standard of living.

As a matter of fact, while
automationdoes cause
displacement, it does not cause
significant unemployment.
Quite to the contrary.
automation has created more
jobs than it has destroyed. The
development of the computer '
is a good example. Actually.
there is greater employment
now than would have been the
case if the technological
advances brought about by
automation had not occurred.

This is illustrated by industry's
experience during the ten-year
period ending in 1965.

Approximately 58-million
additional jobs were created,
while some 50-million jobs were
eliminatedhleaving a net gain

of 8-million positions. _
Significantly, technology in a
large measure prompted the

job gain, but was not the major’
cause ofjob losses. Rather this
resulted more from increased
wage rates occasioned by
statute and agreements
negotiated with unions, and for
the most part affected unskilled

v (jobs, as might be expected.

The displacement, or
redeployment, of workers
resulting from automation
certainly is no cause for alarm.
Quite frequently, people are
released from lower-paying
jobs"and advance to better-
paying positions, all brought
about by aut.omation.Most
firms applying newly available
technologies retrain and place
their employees in new
positions. and invariably
experience the need for
additional personnel as well.
For the most part this means an
upgrading of skills along with
an increased income-earning
potential. and expanded
employment.

Compare the significant
increase in the total work

force of over 70-million, with
average earnings of $2.50 per
hour, to that of 63-million in
1955,whose hourly earnings
averaged $2.00 (equivalent
1965 dollars). In other words,
wage rates and employment
both rose during a decade that
witnessed considerable
automated innovations.

Aside from these bare-bones
statistical facts, the impact of
automation is measurable in
other terms; namely, the
increasing release ofman from
dawn—to-dark drudgery.
Through the utilization of
machines in lieu of brute force
to increase productivity.
significantly greater numbers
have been able to shift to
exciting new occupations that
mean for them larger incomes
and fuller lives. A vast spectrum
of new activities through
increasing applications of
automation is profoundly
affecting our whole mode of
life. The future potential is as
great as man's imaginative
intelligence can develop.

Sincerely.

Music Department

The Music Department at the
University is about to take on an
entirely new look.

Dr. Robert J. Snow, associate
professor of music and newly-
appointed chairman of the depart-_
ment, announced Friday that Mor-
ton Subotnick will join the Pitt
faculty as visiting associate pro-
fessor in the fall of 1969.

Numerous successful scores
for theatrical productions and
10 years experience with electron-
ic tape and music are only part
of the young composer’s back-
ground. _

Subotnick holds an M.A. in
composition from Mills College
and is co-founder of the Mills Col-

- lege Performing Group and of the

San Francisco Tape Music'Cen-
ter. Past assistant professor of
music at Mills. he also served as
director of Ann Halprin’s Dan-
cer‘s Workshop Company.

Prior to his involvement with
the Intermedia Program at the
School of Arts at New York Uni-
versity in 1966, Mr. Subotnick.
was the musical director of the
Repertory Theater at Lincolndenter
during its first season and direc-
tor of electronic. music at the Elec-

tric Circus.
In addition to teaching compo-
sition and lecturing on electronic
music at Pitt. Mr. Subotnick will

design and build an electronic.
tape studio. It will be the first V

tape studio in the Tri-State area
and is expected to be ready next
fall.

Mr. Subotnick’s appointment to
the Pitt faculty makes possible
an entirely new .masters-level
program at the University. For
the first time next fall, students
will be able to earn an M.A. in
composition.

Other changes on the music fac-

ulty include the appointment of 
Dr. Denes Bartha as Permanent.

Andrew Mellon Professor. A dis-
tinguished international musicol-
ogist, Dr. Bartha was formerly
with the Franz Liszt Academy of
Music in Budapest and is a spe-
cialist in the musicof the classi-
cal era and especially in the mu-
sic of Joseph Haydn.

Dr. Bartha was; educated in
Budapest and received his Ph.D.
in historical musicology from the
University of Berlin. In 1963
he was awarded the Dent Medal
by the International Musicology
Society for his re.<earch.'He is an

-_ Coming off a strong performance last week at Penn State;
the matmen close their dual meet season tomorrow afternoon
at Lehigh and coach Dave Adams is anticipating a~‘ftypical” close meet

i.man’s style may give Lavery
some trouble.

“Leeman is a long lanky kid,”
explains the coach. “He’s a leg
wrestler and his style could give
Pat trouble.” . \

Sophomores Dave Icenhower
and Rich Bacastow are also hav-
'ing fine seasons for the Engin-

against Larry Cuba at 130, has
defeated Army’s Mark‘ Mullady.
who in turn has defeated Cuba.
Bacastow will face Bob Kuhn at

Close matches have been the
storyvfor the Imatmen all season.

cording to Adams. “It’1l be the

same as all year long,” he con--

C4A Meet

By ED CONLEY

“Vil1anova Dominates IC4A’s.”

That’s what most people think the headlines will read after
tomorrow's big IC4A meet in New York City’s Madison Square Gar-
den. including track coach Jim Banner.

“Villanova? I don’t think anyone has a chance to beat them,” the
coach said. But. anything can happen. And. it is possible that if any one

team can be responsible for an
upset of the Wildcats. it can be
Banner’s tracksters.
vpect a thinclad championship.
though. They don’t have nearly as

' many competitors as many of the‘

other teams.

Most of the strong Wildcat
athletes will_ go against the track-
sters that are entered, with one
of the most interesting contests
coming’ in the mile run. Jerry
Richey will have to beat a couple
of good Wildcats in that chase if
he wants to take top spot. Marty
Liquori will be the roughest;
Richey has never beaten him.

The other miler is Frank Mur--

phy-
Then, Smitty Brown will try the

600-yard run in the Garden, and.

he will see a little too much of
Villanova, too. Their specialist
in this race is Larry Jamesgone
of the nation’s best. ~

, Brown will come ‘back with the 3

mile relay team as he has all sea-
son. but Banner thinks tomorrow
may be pretty hard on Smitty.

“They’ll all have to make the
trials and finals,” he mentioned.
“That will mean a lot of running
for him.” ’

The relay group of Carlos Rei- ’

sen,‘ Rudy Hufuagle, Wally Swiger
and Brown looks like one of the

best shots at winning a first place. .

They have been beating most of
their oppositions this winter.

“They’ve been running a 220

‘,(yard) track all year,” Banner-

icautioned, however. “With the
11-laps in the Garden there will
be more turns: they should get a
slower time.” -

Don't ex- _

Of course, high jumper Bryant
Salter gets a shot at bettering his
varsity mark in the big meet.
However, even if he goes above
6’ 8” he probably won’t be able
to catch some of the seven-foot
leaps that will be made. ~

There area couple of surprise
entrants in the meet. too. Mark
Vornhagen will run the two-mile
distance thanks to his performan-
ces the last_few times out.

“Mark’s been running real well
lately,” the coach stated. “It will.
depend on how fast a group he

gets in. I hope he makes a strong ’

one.”

The other last-minute selection
for the meet was Greg ‘Ellis, who
will go against the best in the shot

_ put.

One team that went to the
IC4A’s last winter was the frosh
medley relay quartet. That squad‘
finished second to those Wild-
cats. then. Its replacement this
year will try to do better, with Vil-
lanova the top opposition again,
The group of Dorel Watley, Den-
nis Schatzman, Tom Whittaker.
and Ken Balkey could have trou-
ble with teams from Penn’ North-
eastern, and Harvard. too.

Banner wouldn’t- like to predict
anything concerning the meet
tomorrow since “they’re all tough
when you get there. All the little
schools will have one good guy
that nobody knows about. All at
once he’ll pop up and that’s it.”

Of course, _some of Banner’s
guys could “pop up” and sur-
prise some Wildcats, too.

Jay Leeman hasn’t lost at

Whether he wrestles Pete
Henning (Eastern runner-
up at 130 last year) or Art
Rutzen (5-2), Mark Payne
(6-1-2) should be stronger,

should have added incentive
from last week’s tie with

It is essential that who- 6
ever wrestles Christie —
either Levandowski or
Poehl — does not get pin-

es already this year. Here’s
hoping Christie only gets
three. Lehigh,"-14-12.

According to frosh)‘ coach Bob
Fehrs, some very good schools
are sending teams to the tour-
ney and the competition should
be very keen._

“There’s no team title in the
tournament,” Fehrs explained,
:3“so it’s completely an individ-
ual matter. We do have a few boys
with the potential "to win and I
sure hope they do}

“Since there’s ‘no team cham-

pion, I» can’t say exactly what I‘

hope for or expect from them,
but I do know there’ll be some
tough wrestling for some of
them.”

Fehrs anticipates teams from
Penn State, Franklin and Mar-
shall, Clarion, Temple, Mary-
land and Navy to be included in
the tournament entrants. “Navy
always enters two full teams,“
he commented.

“Franklin and Marshall has
three very good freshmen,” he
continued. “One of them was in
the Pennsylvania‘ state cham-
pionships for two‘ years. He’s a
118 pounder and a real good boy."

The freshmen haven’t had a
match since Feb. 21, but Fehrs
doesn’t think the long lay-off will

affect the boys so much as the ag- ,

gravating injuries plaguing them.
He also noted that this will be the
first tournament competition for
the team.

‘_‘A couple of the boys are semi-

injured,” he explained. “They’re ._

not going at full capacity.’_’ L,

   

Two of the semi—injured include
Willie Saloky and Dave Young.
both who are undefeated and rate
a definite chance of winning the
tournament. “Saloky and Young
are both slightly injured, but
they are working out.” Fehrs con-
tinued‘.

Saloky is 3-0 at 177, while You-ng
is 2-0 and will wrestle at 190 in
the tourney. Jim Fleming, 167
pounder, is also undefeated going
into the tournament.

Other freshmen competing, in

the tourney are Greg Michinac .

(118), Bob Pinkos (126), Dave Wi-
ley and Lloyd Mason (134), Bud-
dy Smeltz and Bob O’Connell
(142), Joe Schantz (150) and Den-
ny Schirf (158).

Ridl Installs
Post-Season
Cager Drills

According to ’the 1968-1969
cager basketball schedule, the
season ended March 1 against
CMU. But don’t tell coach Buzz
Ridl. '

“The next few weeks we’ll
be working together — the fresh-
men and the varsity.” said Ridl.
“We haven’t had the chance to
do this before.”

Ridl wants to see which play-
ers work well together. He also
wants a better idea of how well
some of the talented freshmen
will fit into next year’s attack.

“Some of the freshmen will
definitely be pushing this year’s
starting men out of jobs,” said
Ridl. “But I’m not giving them
the jobsk they’ll have to push for
them.”

Ridl’s only really consistent
player this season has been soph-
omore guard Mike Caldwell. Cald-
well was the team’s leading scor-
er with 280 points, an 11.6 pace.

“He’s a pretty sound guard,".

said Ridl. “He’ll be important
in our plans.” «'

Ridl will be particularly inter-
ested in his three frosh guards
— Kent Scott, Bob Cizmarick,
and Steve Lewis. Two of thethree
will most likely crash the start-
ing line-up when Ridl hopes to set
the 2-3 offense that he used at
Westminster.

Ridl will also be watching
Paul O’Gorek. the frosh center

who now presents the tallest

frame on the squad at 6-7. O’Gor-
ek has the size and weight needed
to help a small cager team. I

“He has to develop his jump-
ing more." said Ridl. “but he has
good size."

O’Gorek led the team in scor-
ing with a 16.3 average in 14
games. The big man‘was also
the leading rebounder.

O‘Gorek and the three start-
ing frosh guards will be pushing
Mike Patcher. Rob McFarland.
Jerry Causer. and Bob Petrini.

— It’s the kind of pressure need-

ed to stimulate “best-perform-
ances” out of the incumbents.
Ridl will be-watching closely.

Lewis Expects‘ New Look’
To Reach Pre-Season Goal:

1969 National Champions

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL . ‘
Assistant Sports Editor

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis is at it again. The eternal op-
timist is talking NCAA championship, no ands, ifs, buts, or

maybes.

“We want to put together a 22 game winning streak,” said Lewis.‘
“That’s how many games we play this year.”

Lewis sees only one reason for
not winning 22 games — rain.

“Rain-outs are the most frus-
trating thing for us,” said Lewis,
recalling the many postpone-
ments in past seasons. “That’s
the worst thing that can happen.”

But Lewis has more to worry
about than ‘just the rain. Seven of
the scheduled 22' games could con-
ceivably be forfeited. The mit-
ters are slated to play the first
game of a week-long tournament
in Florida, March_ 24, and as yet
there isn’t enough money avail-
able to finance the trip.

A number of interested alum-
ni contributed $2,000 of the $4,000
needed, but the mitters are still
$2,000 in the red. The athletic de-
partment rejected Lewis’s plea
for the additional money.

Last year the mitters raffled
off a colored TV set ‘to pay for
the pre-season trip to sunny Cali-
fornia, but they weren’t permit-

ted to do that again this year. ,

Dr, Jack Critchfield notified Lew-
is that it was against the Uni-
versity’s regulations.

Lewis is still hoping for more‘
alumni contributions. If not, the
mitters could find themselves
in an embarrassing situation.

“Don’t worry,” said Lewis.
“We’re going. But there’s no
truth to the rumor that we’re go-
ing to thumb our way down.”

“We’ll pay our own way if we
have to,” added Lewis determin-
ed. “We’re really looking for-
ward to the trip.”

Even if the mitters do get down
to Florida, Lewis will have to wor-
ry about more than just the rain
preventing a 22-game win season.
This year’s schedule is tougher
than past seasons. ‘

The Florida Tournament. which
will be like spring training for
the mitters, features such powers
as the hosting University of Mi-
ami nine, Florida A&M, Army.
Michigan State, and Cincinnati.

The opening game of the regu-

lar season pits the mitters
against West Virginia April 3.
Two days later, the mitters host
one of last year’s Eastern pow-

‘ers, Temple, in a double-header.

“After May 23 it lets up.” quip-
ped Lewis. “But that’s the last
game of the season.”

But Lewis is not.really_worried

about the schedule. The confident

mentor, with visions of NCAA
grandeur. is just waiting for his
young team to prove themselves
in competition.

Five of last year’s’ starting
nine are missing from the prac-
tices. -Pitcher-outfielder Dave
Welty, shortstop Ken Cooke,
outfielder George McKenzie, first
baseman Tom Smith, and out-
fielder Tom Stickle are all grad-
uating.

“Four of our top five hitters
from last season,” said Lewis,
“are graduating, so hitting is an
unknown quantity and quality
this year. But fielding could be
our strong point.”

There’s just no way Lewis
sees a losing season. and to him.

last year" was just such a disap- ‘

pointment. -

“We were only 16-9 last year,”
said Lewis. “It was a bad sea-
son.” _\

Lewis’s mound staff will be
based around junior footballers

George Medich and Frankie Gus— g

tine. Last season, Medich post-
ed a 5-1 mark and a team low
ERA of 1.52. Gustine finished,
3-2. including a sparkling vic-
tory over powerful UCLA.
‘But-the graduation of south-
paw Dave Welty leaves’ a big
gap to be filled. Bill T/ress. a re-
lief pitcher last year, and two
sophomores, Frank Minicarel-
li and John Fredland. are the only
other lefthanders on the staff.

“Someone will pick up the
slack,’L said Lewis. “We’ll just
have a little trouble when the
schedule is tight in the begin-
ning.”

Help W anted: Black Assistant
C By ROY JACOBS Sports Editor

Very simply, a black assistant is need-
ed. Last season, in early September, there
was very nearly a serious racial flare-up
on the football team. The problem is a se-
rious lack of communication.

Black athletes need someone to whom
they can relate. In the past, the black stu-
dent at Pitt had the same problem. Then

 

  Freshman Cagers 
ImproVementCited 

By BILL NAAB

The purpose of freshman basketball is not merely to win.
but to improve the fundamentals of basketball. Apparently the
coaches of the Panther basketball frosh have achieved their purpose
this past season. Both coaches Jim Monroe and Tim Grgurich rate the
Cub hoopsters vastly improved since the beginning of the season.

There is no doubt that there are still
many problems centering around athlet-
‘ics' at Pitt. The baseball team has to
scrounge up 78 dollars a man to enter a
‘prestigious Florida tournament. The bas-
ketball team can’t even beat Carnegie-Mel-
lon. And the wrestling team is still one man
away from a formidable squad.

But it seems fairly obvious that most
a of the student concern for sports centers
around football. One student spoke for many
this week when he called for the elimina-

Carl DePasqua’s been at the helm a
month and a half now, and he hasn’t even '
Jffinished naming his staff yet. Although
some recruiting has been done, not one
prospect has been announced as signed.
‘Spring practice starts in three weeks.

. At this point, the more serious prob-
‘ lem is the former. Originally, Athletic Di-
— rector Casimir Myslinski wanted to attract
5 a head coach and his staff, so any readjust-
ment effects would be minimal. Instead,
we have a staff still getting to know each
other which hasn’t yet been completed.

But add a monkey wrench to the prob-
__'lem of filling a staff: Campus sources indi-
' cate DePasqua is being (at the least) urg-
2 ed to add a black assistant. The New York
Post the other day inferred that DePasqua
‘ is resisting the urgings and is, in general,

the University went out and hired two black
administrators and now black faculty. Why
not football, too?

A black coach can understand the black
athlete’s problems. As one black gridder
' pointed out last year, “Everyone expects
you to run a 9.5 on the football, field, weav-
ing in and out, while running with a pulled
hamstring. And if you don’t d9 it every time,
they think you’re loafing.” ’ '

To which another added, “He (the first .
athlete) once pulled a hamstring and they
(the coaches) asked me to go talk to him.
Theywanted to know whyhe wasn’t putting
out. They thought he was loafing.” 

Ablack coach, tends to eliminate the
misconceptions and facilitate player-coach
dialogue. Coaches aren’t necessarily ra-
cist; they’re just operating under the same
wrong notions as most whites.

Some might claim that DePasqua’s
addition of a black coach is mere token-
ism. In a sense it is; but it is a needed to-
kenism. The first in anything is always a

 

 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
  

In Grgurich’s absence, coach
Monroe stated that Grgurich has
done a great job on the improve-
ment of fundamentals._ “He‘s
done more than the record has
told. The main thing isn't just
wins. The team has improved in
the small things like screening
and passing.” —

Monroe also remarked that if
he was pressed to give a general
analysis of the team. he would
point out the need to strengthen
the_Cubs‘ fast break. In addition.
he mentioned that the team had
done a good job off the boards.

‘and several players had start-
ed to come around near the end of
the just completed 9-5. season.

He said, “Ed Paluzzi was in-
jured at the beginning and did a
fine job afterwards. Glen Wol-
fel got his chance when Kent Scott
injured his wrist and has turned
out to be a pretty good ballhand-
ler.”

Paluzzi later commented that

“They‘re all good shooters. and
we‘ve had balanced scoring all
during the season.“ he said. “We
might foul a lot. but that‘s what
happens when a team's aggres-
sive."

Two of the Cubs’ more aggres-
sive contests of the year are
“games to remember,” accord-
ing to Grgurich. He cited’ the
spectacular 70-69 .victory
against West Virginia and the
rugged loss to powerful and still
unbeaten Robert Morris Junior
College as the two most dramat-
ic struggles of the recent sea-
son. '

Paul O’Gorek, Steve Lewis,
and Bob Cizmarik contributed
to many of those dramatic and ex-
citing moments of the season.
They also finished as the three
leading Cub scorers. '

Survey Reveals Views on Racism

Does racism exist among Uni-
versity students? With this ques-
tion in mind, the Process ’69 Com-
mittee Against White Racism
last November developed a ques-
tionnaire designed to survey at-
titudes of white students on racial
matters, particularly as they
pertained to the University. The
conclusions from the survey con-
cerning these attitudes came
from 676 qrestionnaires.

The recent occupation of the
Computer Center by black stu-
dents brought to the attention of
many the existence and some of
the objectives of the Black Ac-
tion Society. Of the students poll-
ed. 54% had not even heard of the
Black Action Society as recently
as last November. An additional
31’; of the students were also
unaware of its goals. Of those stu-
dents who felt they knew the goals
of the BAS. only 33% indicated
some degree of approval.

To the ‘query. “If the majority
of black students requested all
black houses in the dormitories.
would you be in favor?” 32.4‘.-é
said yes and 65.53% said no. The
majority commented that all
black houses would foster a hos-
tile. separatist atmosphere at
the University. One student felt
that “if a white and a black stu-
dent are housed in the same room.
they can only hope at best that
they won’t kill each other.” The
group in favor of an exclusive
dorm based on race felt generally
that if it was the will of the ma-
jority. such a move would be
beneficial.

Another question asked, “Do
you think that black students who
don’t meet the regular stand-
ards for admission should be ad-
mitted to the University?” 17.9%
were in favor and an overwhelm-
ing 80.91% responded negatively.
The typical opinion was that ev-
eryone, regardless of rac e,
should be considered for admis-
sion under a general standard.

Those approving said that many
blacks do not receive the same
educational background as white
applicants and some _remarked

that they would be in favor of
such a policy if admissions were
made with the stipulation that
the less qualified student agrees

to a probationary, or trial, accept- '

ance which would be made per-
manent after atrial period of spe-
cial tutoring to increase academic
proficiency. Respondents against
this situation made their objec-
tions in an emphatic manner.
“If it’s true they’re not infer-
ior. they should be able to meet
the standards.”

In a more personal sphere.
another question asked, “What do
you think about dating between
blacks and whites?" “Have you
ever dated a person of the oppo-
site race?” (Note: only white
students surveys were tabulated)
67.6% approved with the very gen-
eral liberal sentiment that “it's
up to the individual” and “we are
all people.” ‘

However, only 5.9% said they
have engaged in interracial dating
as opposed to 93.63% who said they
did not. In answer to the ques-
tion “Would you ever date a per-

son of the opposite race?” 17.6%
said they would date a black per-
son and 44.8% answered that they
would not.

When asked about the role of
the white person in light of the
racial conflict, 44.4% checked the
response. “Whites should help
in the black community," seven
percent checked “Nothing, as
black people don’t want the help of
white people." Forty-nine per-
cent felt that whites should help
in the white community. Com-
ments on this question ran in a
basically hostile tone; “Why
help them, what did they do for
me?" and “Help them if they want
your help and will appreciate it —
don‘t give them more than they
deserve.” '

To the general inquiry of “What
do you think black people want?"
more than 80% wrote standard
opinions such as identity, equal-
ity. opportunity, pride, etc. Four
percent thought the goal was
black supremacy and 11% opted
‘for separate development. The
committee was greatly intrigued

by that particular response.
It would seem that liberalism
and equality are easy commod-
ities to obtain and convenient
philosophies to espouse.

However, in relation to the oth-
er questions in the survey involv-
ing dating, admissions, housing,
etc., responses as a totality indi-
cate that racial matters hitting a
bit closer to home bring out a
good deal more caution. Some of
the students did seem to be sin-
cere in their positive attitudes

on race relations. One undergrad-‘

uate simply .answered that he
thought the crux of black aspir-
ations was

“a place in the sun
where they can run I

a place where they can be free -

from stupid folk like you and
me.” .
