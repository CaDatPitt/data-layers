Coffee grounds
    promote
sustainability

Meagan Hart
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Last October, senior environmental studies
major Jessica‘McDona1d came up with the
idea to have an on—campus coffee shop save
coffee grounds to promote a more sustainable
environment.

Inspired by a conversation with a Star-
bucks employee who said recycled used cof-
fee grounds can beneﬁt the environment,
McDonald set out to advance environmental
sustainability at Pitt.

“The grounds can be used as compost to
put in gardens, rather than just throwing it
away,” McDonald, also astudent sustainability
coordinator for Sodexo, said.

McDonald introduced the program
Grounds for Growth last October to focus on
collecting used coffee grounds for composting
and gardening. The program was put in place
on Feb. 24. McDonald said that in the three
weeks since that date, people have picked up
about 50 bags of reused coffee grounds. Ifthe
project continues, participants in Grounds for
Growth will reuse about 600 pounds of coffee
grounds every semester.

McDonald said that a student volunteer
goes to the Oakland Bakery and Market ev-
ery day between 2 and 3 p.m. and scoops the

used coffee grounds into biodegradable and
compostable bags. The bags are then placed
on the bakery’s window sill for anyone to pick
up for composting or gardening.

At Pitt, coffee grounds are available for free
at the bakerybetween 8 am. and 5 p.m. inbio-
degradable bags that come with directions for
how one can reuse the grounds. Compostable
coffee ﬁlters are placed in the bags,‘ as well,
McDonald said. I

Susan Fukushima, Sodexo’s resident dis-
trict manager, said before McDonald imple-
mented the project, the bakery threw away
about 10.5 pounds of used coffee grounds
each week.

Thatwas a large enough volume of grounds
for her idea to make an impact and be worth
her time, McDonald said.

Nicole Wojtowicz, the nighttime supervi-
sor of Oakland Bakery and Market, said she
supported McDonald’s program.

“We do produce a lot of waste,” Wojtowicz
said. “It’s nice for us toﬂtake part injess’ idea.”

program promotes a “healthy feel,” alongwith
other initiatives the bakery has adopted, such
as McDonald’s BYO(bag) initiative, a project
that aims to cut down ‘on the use of plastic
bags around campus.

“We sell a lot of gluten-free foods, and
I think that the whole plastic bag idea has
been very beneﬁcial, too. I’cl say the bag use
has been cut in half since it began,” she said.

To gain ﬁnancial support for Grounds for
Growth, McDonald wrote a proposal tojames
Earle, executive vice chancellor of business
and director of food and housing services.
Earle was unable to disclose the program’s
cost by the time of publication. ,

“It was easy_ for the University to support
this project, and [it’s] just another example
of how we are working with our students to
make Pitt and our world more sustainable,”
Earle said. ‘

According to McDonald, some of the sup-
plies needed included barrels and bags to hold
and bring home the grounds and baskets for
the windows. .

McDonald then reached out to a few stu-
dent organizations including the Fair Food
Cooperative, a club that is working with the
Real Food Challenge, anational organization

that strives to help college students push for
healthier and greener on—campus dining ser-
vices, and Free the Planet, an environmental
organization that fosters awareness of envi-
ronmental issues.

A total of 14 volunteers have helped collect
coffee grounds and set up the project.

Anna Greenberg, aﬁeshman who planson
majoring in environmental studies, involved
herself in the project through the Fair Food
Cooperation club.

Once a week for about 30 minutes, she
volunteers by bagging up the bakery’s coffee
grounds.

“[The program] promotes Pitt as an envi-
ronmentally conscious campus, gives people
an opportunity to get free fertilizer for their
gardens and helps the’ Oakland Bakery cut
down on their waste,” Greenberg said.

In terms of improvement, Greenberg be-
lieves students must be better informed about
the beneﬁts of composting and the different
ways they can get involved in environmental
projects. _

“I think that there are lots of great proj-
ects happeningall around Pitt’s campus, both
sustainability-related or other, that students
could really get into iftheyjust knew that the

projects were happening,” Greenberg said. ’

Grounds for Growth is beneﬁcial to com-
munity members who love to compost.

Matthew Peters, a self-proclaimed “worm
whisperer,” raises red wigglerworms and sells
the compost they make for a living at a farm
in Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood.
Three weeks ago, he picked up about 10 or 15
pounds of coffee grinds from the bakery for
the worms after talking to McDonald about
her project.

“The project is targeted toward anyone
who has a passion for gardening and compost-
inginthe Pitt community,” Peters, 45, said. “I
like to use coffee grounds because it doesn’t
attract other animals and the worms love it.”

Peters said he has been using coffee
grounds for many years and already has a
source for them, but he said he would be
“happy to go back to support the program
in the ﬁiture.”

Markets and bakeries throughout the
Pittsburgh area are also implementing com-
posting programs.

to organize the event. He said between 500
and 600 people attended the event, which
he considers a success.

Anderson previously served as associ-
ate dean of student life at Washington and

Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., before
coming to Pitt earlier this year. There, he
helped organize a similar annual charity
game involving Steelers players and students
for the past four years.

“It’s deﬁnitely somethingwe’d try to pur-
sue for next year,” Anderson said. “We’ll talk
to students and see how they liked it and see
how we can improve so we can do it again.”

The Pitt Advantage Grant exists to en-
hance students’ college experiences and to
help students gain a competitive edge for
the job marketplace and graduate or profes-
sional" schools by providing study abroad
and internship opportunities.

To be eligible for a grant, undergraduate

» students must be of ﬁill-time status for no

less than two terms, be in good academic
standing and be returning to the University

as a full—time student the semester follow-
ing the learning experience. Students also
must have fully completed all goals and re-
quirements of the OCC. Grants are awarded

at $1,500 each, and applications for the

coming summer term are currently being
accepted. ‘

“Typically when students go out to get
jobs, [employers] want to see these diverse
experiences from job applicants,” Anderson
said. “We want to provide these types of
experiences for students at Pitt.”

Brian Terreri, a junior pharmacy major
and president of thePanther Pitt, Pitt’s of-
ﬁcial student cheering section at football
games, participated in the event as a player
for the Panthers. _

i “As a Philadelphia [Eagles] fan, this gave
me an opportunity to talk a little smack,”
he said. _

' The Steelers roster featured notable play-
erssuch as wide receiver Antonio-Brown,
running back Le’Veon Bell, defensive end
Cameron Heyward and former quarterback
Charlie Batch. -

Terreri said that at a team practice held
for Pitt’s players on Monday, the teammates
got to gel and spend time getting to know

each other.

He also spoke about the increasing in-
tensity of the game as the minutes on the
clock ticked by.

“At the beginning, they were going pretty
soft, but I gotta say, they’ve turned it up. I
got whacked by Le’Veon.”

According to Brown, Charlie Batch was
the most vocal in rallying the troops to join
the event.

“We get to be a part of the community,”
Brown said. “I love Pitt and this is a great
atmosphere.” -

Anderson spoke about the diversity of
participants from the Panthers’ side and said
that among the players were students from
the Oakland Zoo, Pathﬁnders, the Panther
Pitt and a women’s soccer player.

Jen Walsh, a senior in Pitt’s School of
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, attend-
e/d to event to ‘support fellow Pathﬁnder Pat
0’Donnell, who was playing in the game.
She said the event demonstrated the ties

l between the city and the University.

“It’s like a city-meets-school kind of
thing,” she said.

trict, is also very concerned with reusing
and composting items, according to the
market’s programming director, Johanna
Klotz. ,

“Any unused items are donated to a men’s
shelter in Pittsburgh called Light of Life,”
Klotz said. “Foods'that aren’t donated or
reused are put in three bins in the back of
the store where they will be taken away to
be composted.”

Marty’s Market has a contract with
AgRecycle, a company that contracts with
different restaurants and markets in Pitts-
burgh to take leftover products and bring
them to composting sites.

According to Klotz, “composting is an
all—around good process” because the store
is able to pay by the truckload to compost
waste, which saves money and also beneﬁts
the environment. -

“We do what we can to make sure that
food gets to people by trying to create as
close to a closed-loop system as possible,”
Klotz said. I

Linkedln is planning to team up with em-
ployers in order to resolve issues regard-
ing retaining qualiﬁed' employees within
companies that are losing their best and
brightest to competitors.

The proposal comes in light of a survey
Linkedln administered that studied why
employees left their most recent jobs and

portunities at other ﬁrms while employed,
among other issues. The results showed
that employees most often left their jobs
for better wages and beneﬁts or because
of an inability to advance in the company
at which they were employed.

Linkedln, which already provides
millions of users with a professional net-
working platform, is hoping to create an
internal roster of sorts for companies to
look within their own ranks for employ-
ees to ﬁll open positions, allowing them
to move laterally or upwardly within the
company. The problem with this proposal
is that while employers don’t often look in
their own backyard when searching to ﬁll
positions, creating an internal roster could

, discourage employers from looking into
high—achieving, highly employable groups

how frequently employees searched for op— -

of people -— namely, the demographics A

that have high unemployment rates such
as minorities and college graduates.

Iaaam -' . _

   

Linkedln could prevent graduates, minorities from getting a 5nh.lM(:”Ti campus

  

and qualiﬁcations of their own employees
can help to retain employees. However,
this, over an extended period of time, may
restrict new and otherwise diverse talent

What is more, internal applicants al- '
ready have the upper hand in terms_of
these job openings. They were hired by
that company, they’re familiar with the en-

vironment and are more likely to be alerted
to j ob openings before outside candidates.
This knowledge and experience is highly
valuable when employers look to ﬁll posi-
tions because it saves them both time and
money.

For those entering the work force,
individual experience and expertise may
or may not qualify them to_ ﬁll openings
in companies. But this proposed system
could drive employers to attribute less
signiﬁcance to these outside applicants’
qualiﬁcations, thereby putting them at a
serious disadvantage. And with the job
market already notoriously difficult for
demographics such as college graduates
and minorities to navigate, an additional
barrier that willfurther complicate the
process of getting a foot in the door will
only increase thealready high unemploy-
ment rate among these demographics.

While Linkedln is providing a service
that can help human resources depart-
ments retain the experience of their em-
ployees, those departments, and their re-
spective companies, must not forget that
new faces can provide the growth and in-
novation they need to prosper. I

COLUMN

.World leaders can learn from admirable qualities of Pope Francis

Matt Barnes
Columnist

Jorge Bergoglio, better known as Pope

Francis, hasn’t drastically changed church

doctrine or unconditionally praised the de-

veloped world and church allies. However,
the tone in which he delivers his message is

wonderﬁllly refreshing to a world in need of
true leadership and progress.

The man 1.2 billion Catholics look to as
their leader has made many headlines since ‘

his March 13, 2013, election to the papacy.
Most notably, Francis has proclaimed the
importance of acceptance and mercy. He has
centeredhis mission on the welcoming oflost
souls as opposed to the expulsion of them.

I

What is more, he has opened the church to the
lost, rather than limiting access exclusively to
the already found. In his own words, Francis
likens his vision of the church to a hospital.
When initiaﬁng care and healing, hesaid,
“It is useless to ask a seriously injured per-
son if he has high cholesterol and about the
level of his blood sugars. You have to heal his
wounds. Then we can talk about everything
else.”

orthodox Catholics unsettled. Despite Fran-
cis’ upholding of church doctrine regarding
abortion and same-sex marriage, the bishop
of Rome has shared his feelings about current
approaches to these divisive issues.

In an interview released in September,

It is this approach that has left some more-

the Pope said that the church has become too
obsessed with certain issues such as abortion,
homosexuality and contraception.

“The church has sometimes locked itself

up in small things, in small—minded rules. 

We have to ﬁnd a new balance, otherwise even‘

the moral ediﬁce of the church is likely to fall.

like ahouse of cards, losing the freshness and
fragrance of the gospel.”

Two in three American Catholics _agree
with him — including myself. It is not that we
believe more abortions should be performed
or moral depravity should be the spirit of
the day. It is rather the means to obtain the
ends that is the question. Francis and his
followers understand that punishment does
not set one free. Rather, grace and mercy

are the divine liberators, and only through
these benevolent qualities can a church and

its members truly grow.

In regards to homosexuality, Francis 

gone so far as to say, “Who am»I to judge?”

Through this remark, the absolute sov-
ereign of the Vatican City—state embodies 1”
the core of Catholicism -— the love of others
and the practice of the gospel. After all, even

the pope is human, just like those he leads.

Saint Peter’s successor leads by example, a

quality worth praising no matter one’s views
and beliefs.

Francis’ devotion to the poor has placed

him into the ring of global economic dia-

logue. He speaks with genuine zeal in an era
lacking sincerely passionate leaders. Francis
has not hidden his frustration with regard
to capitalism. -

“How can it be that it is not a news item

» when an elderly homeless person dies of ex-
" posure, but it is news when the stock market

loses two points?” he said. “Some people con-
tinue to defend trickle-down theories which

assume that economic growth, encouraged
by a free market, will inevitably succeed in
bringing about greater justice and inclusive-
ness in the world. This opinion .-.. has never
been conﬁrmed by the facts.”

Thankfully though, Pope Francis is no
Marxist. He is not advocating a dictatorship
of the proletariat or a state-controlled econ-
omy, but simply and courageously acknowl-
edging the undeniable reality that unfettered
capitalism can often bring great inequity and
negative results to the weak, those whom the
church is sworn to protect. Consequently, it is

his job to act not as an Ivy League economist

, but as a protector of the poor in a moral, not

empirical, fashion.

' Additionally, Francis represents prag-
matic and bold leadership that is diﬂicult to
ﬁnd in aworld of gross polarization. Through
his upholding of church doctrine but softened
and welcoming demeanor, Francis has taught
that not everything has to be all—or—notl1ing.
One can be of faith but not a fanatic and one
can advocate capitalism without avarice.
The world needs more practical and effec-
tive moderates, and Pope Francis is proving

to be exactly that. .. H

Too often leaders are afraid to stand up
for what is unpopular, but Pope Francis has
done and continues to do just that. No matter
one’s religious affiliation, political party or
economic agenda, the bold and courageous
leadership of the 266th pontiff is admirable
and worthy of the world’s respect. One can
only hope world leaders will be able to look
past their prejudices, agendas and precon-
ceived notions and follow the lead of Pope
Francis -— a truly admirable leader. I

thing or two

St. Vincent, the album, is an exercise-

in reﬁnement. Some artists —— such as
The National and The xx — have based
their entire careers around tediously
pursuing a signature sound. Luckily An-
nie Clark, the mastermind behind St.
Vincent, is far more interesting than
the aforementioned champions of con-
sistency. _

  St. Vincent continues her
evolution on self—titled album

her last effort, 2o11’s excellent Strange
Mercy. But after such a deﬁning and
assured statement as Mercy, what else
could she have done? Since the album
was already so strange — a distinctly
original avant-garde pop-rock record
— you couldn’t call her unambitious
for only making minor tweaks.

ST. VINCENT

track is anchored by driving saxophone.
Clark assumes the role of a digital de-
pendent and ponders, “If I can’t show
it, if you can’t see me/ what’s the point
of doing anything?” On “Huey Newton”
— inspired by a vivid dream in which
she spoke to Newton, co-founder of
the Black Panthers — Clark imagines
a frightening future “entombed in the

shrine of zeros and ones,” full of chil-
dren “turned online assassins.”

But not all of St. Vincent teems with
paranoia. In fact, Clark dabbles into
some of the most accessible material
of her career on this record. “Prince
Johnny” is a droning dream—pop number
that could easily be mistaken for a Beach
House song if not for Clark’s trademark
vocal swells. .

“I Prefer Your Love” and “Severed
Crossed Fingers” highlight some of her
most simple, lush and full moments on

the record. She even pulls off a straight-
forward rocker with “Regret.” Sure,
lesser artists probably could have writ-

. ten some of these songs, but they would

have done so without the lively punch
and bite that Clark so keenly balances.
Approachable as it may be, St. Vin-

cent still packs much of the wails, shred- _<

ding and disorientation of Strange Mer-
cy. Opening track “Rattlesnake” throbs
and pulses with genuine fear. When the
song climaxes with a rousing guitar solo,
it doesn’t feel cheap or unearned. “Birth

in Reverse” also could be mistaken for
a typical rock song, if it weren’t for its
frank approach to the mundane (“take
out the garbage, masturbate”) and its
jarring clangs and wails. .

Much like on Strange. Mercy, Clark
is at her best when she abides by some
conventions of guitar rock while vio-
lently pushing against others. St. Vin-

, cent can get away with being a bit fa-

miliar because Clark is still delving into
space that few current artists dare to
explore‘: I

Streets. During that era, brick Victorians
were still a relative rarity in the United

. States. Most houses, even nice ones, were

made from wood thatwas ordered and

- shipped as part of a kit. Thus, many 19th-
century houses can look as if they rolled off i

an assembly line, subscribing to the same
plan and style as the rest of the houses in
their city. '

The houses of the Mexican War Streets,
however, area testament to Pittsburgh as
an industrial city, showing off both skilled
labor and ﬁne building materials. Brick
and stone abound here, and every building
retains vestiges of elegance.

The picturesque Inn on the Mexican
War Streets is a perfect example of this.
Located in the former Boggs Mansion
on North Avenue, the charming bed and
breakfast looks much as it would have
in the 19th century. The stone building
is replete with an arched front veranda,
wrought-iron fence and a beautiful liv-

a ing room with polished wooden walls and

vintage furniture.
While calm and quiet tend to deﬁne the
Mexican War Streets, Pittsburgh neigh-

borhoods are rarely so singular in their-

characteristics. The Mexican War Streets
neighborhood, of course, is no exception.
There is "a lively side to the area and its

exploring her personal life warrants a
comparison to poet Frank O’Hara, who,
of course, is the inspiration for Kline’s
use of “Frankie” as a pseudonym.

“I’m just a normal girl, but my name is
Frank,” she sings on album closer “Sad.”

Zentropy ﬁnds her characteristic
less-is-more songwriting style in a stu-
dio setting, a first for the artist, whose
early releases were known for incorpo-
rating the sound ofpassing cars and po-
lice sirens on the streets below Cosmos’
apartment.

“I’m the kind of girl buses splash with
rain,” Cosmos nearly whispers on the
aptly titled “Buseslsplash With Rain.”
Her language here is crisp and poignant

— a poetry professor would have a field .

day with her choice of words. “Kind of

girl” has become a loaded phrase in our

modern lexicon, and Cosmos knows it.
A poetryistudent at NYU, Cosmos

embodies the city’s literary past with‘

a youthful wit that is rare in any artist
—— much less one who’s still too young
to buy alcohol. ‘ . ’
“You shook me around, drove on the
wrong side of the road,” she sings on “Le-
onie.” The song’s “bake,r’s.dozen of bad
affairs,” shifts when the narrator meets

her fictional counterpart, Ronnie, who '
is, among other things, a fan of olives.

“Pm bitter like olives, that’s why you
like them and I don’t,” Cosmos sings.

The son:g’s male vocals’, sung by.-
Aaron Mainejof the equally enigmatic
band Porches, contribute to. the ‘folklore l

of “Frankie and Ronnie,” a cosmic love

story that requires at least $40 to spare
' ,on>Bandcamp (well wo_rth it) and an af-

ternoon to -spend sobbing alone in your
room (also worth it)’. Even then, Cosmos"
songwriting gives‘ acertain illusion of

fact that makes it both compelling and

frustratingly opaque. g V

Dan McCoy

and US sled

hockey team
take gold in
Sochi

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Dan McCoy and the U.S. Paralympic Sled
Hockey team won a gold medal on Sat-
urday night in Sochi, Russia.

The 1-0 victory over the host na-
tion secured the Paralympics Games’
top prize for the 20-year-old and his
teammates. It was the team’s second-
straight Paralympic triumph, having
also achieved a ﬁrst-place finish in Van-
couver, Canada, four years ago.

McCoy, a Cheswick, Pa., native and
Pitt student, logged 6:15 on the ice in
the final to cap his first time compet-
ing at the event, the highest level of
disability sport. .

A forward on the team, he was one
of 17 people on the roster that went to
Sochh

While there, he played in three of the
team’s five games, most notably assist-
ing on two goals in a 3-0 victory over
South Korea in pool play. He ﬁnished
the tournament with a plus-minus of
three in 21:42 of ice time.

The result also avenged a defeat in‘
the team’s last group-stage game, 2-1.

The sport, known as sledge hockey
abroad, featured seven other nations,
including bronze medalist Canada, who
the Americans shut out in the semifi-
nals, 3-0.

McCoy, a second-year rehabilitation
science major, is not in school this se-
mester, having devoted his time to train-
ing on his own and with the team prior
to the competition.

He returned to Pittsburgh-on Sunday.

BASEBALL

Pitt comes backto beat Akron, 11-8

  SPORTS

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt baseball was swept last weekend at

Virginia Tech when the Panthers were

' unable to hold leads against the Hokies.

Wednesday against Akron, the Zips put Pitt

in a familiar situation by overcoming the

Panthers’ early lead and holding an advan-
tage through the top of the sixth inning.
The Panthers scored a pair of runs in
the bottom of the sixth to tie the game,
then took the lead on an RBI single off Matt
]ohnson’s bat. Pitt (9-10, 1-5 ACC) never
gave the lead back after that and added ﬁve
runs of insurance in the eighth to secure
an 11-8 victory at Charles L. Cost Field.
While head coachjoejordano was glad
to get a win, let alone play the game after
rain caused a one-hour delay before the
ﬁrst pitch, he said his team “made a lot
of mistakes today.” I
“They’re not mistakes that will show
up, but they’re costing us internally and
that’s what we have to correct,” Jordano

asey Roche (right) went 2-for-4 and drove in a pair of runs. Bobby Mizia |Visua| Editor

said. “It’s a pitch here or an at-bat or
something on that base path, and those
are things that are more instinctive than
anything, and we’ve gotta clean it up.”

His team was able to compensate for
those mistakes, though, mostly on the
backs of Casey Roche and Steven Shelinsky
Jr. Each player went 3-for-4, with Roche
driving in a pair of runs and scoring two
of his own while Shelinsky notched one
of both.

Roche started Tuesday’s game against
Youngstown State on the mound and didn’t
get to hit. He hit cleanup Wednesday as
Pitt’s designated hitter, and his team was

ready to go against a familiar foe.

“Well we’ve faced them every year since
I’ve been here, two or three times a year,‘
and it’s a lot of the same arms,” Roche said.
“We have a pretty good scouting report on
those guys, so with the weather we weren’t
sure if the game was going to go "nine, so
we just tried to jump on them early, jump
on the fastball.”

Shelinsky’s day continues a hot streak

for the ﬁfth—year senior, who is now batting
.500 (13-for—2 6) in his last six games with
three home runs and 11 RBIs.

“I’ve been working on a lot of different
things that were going wrong,” Shelinsky

- said. “I guess ever since I got back from

being healthy I hit that hot streak and have
just been rolling with it. [I’m] just trying
to jump on fastballs early in the count and
see where it takes me.”

The hitting performances ofJordano’s
big bats allowed for his team to extend
its lead late in the game and put the Pitt
comeback victory away.

“Those two guys are our money guys,
they’re our RBI guys,”Jordano said. “Top
of the order, Stephen [Vranka] and Dylan
[Wolsonovich] , they gotta get on base for
us and have the middle of the lineup in
RBI situations. When we did have those
later in the game, they delivered and that’s
our game.”

V WRESTLING

Eight Panthers head to Oklahoma City for NCAA Championships

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcyff Wrz'ter

Three senior Panthers are making their ﬁnal
trip to the NCAA Tournament, and they have

 one last thing to prove.

“I’m deﬁnitely going with the mentality
that I want to stand on that podium and be
an All-American,” heavyweight P.]. Tasser
said. “I want to just cut it loose, have some
fun and bring home some hardware.” A

For the third time in four years, the Pitt
wrestling program will send eight wrestlers
to the National Championships, which begin
today in Oklahoma City. The senior trio,
which consists of 125-pound Anthony Zanet-

ta, 133-pound Shelton Mack and Tasser, has * .

combined for six total trips to the national
tournament, not counting this year’s trip.
Despite their success, none of the current
seniors have earned All-American status
for their performanceat the NCAA Tour-
nament during their careers. The top eight

March 20, 2014 | The Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittnevvs.com

wrestlers in each weight class are crowned
All-Americans. Zanetta enters the tourna-
ment as the No. 15 seed, while Mack and

Tasservare unseeded. -

' “It is crucial in my last year to not hold
anything back at nationals,’-’ Zanetta said.
“I have nothing to lose at this point, and.I

i really want to enjoy my last competition.” 1

. As seniors, the three are hoping to upset
some higher-ranked younger wrestlers who

must deal with the pressure that comes with »

high expectations. ~

N For Mack, having experienced the com- V

petition on collegiate wrestling’s biggest
stage may put him, and some of the other
more seasoned wrestlers, at an advantage.
“After being there a couple of times, it
helps knowing what it takes to be an All-
American,”he said. . '
Mack, along with sophomore 197—pound—
er Nick-Bonaccorsi,.were at—large qualiﬁers,

one of the automatic bids the ACC had up
for grabs at the conference tournament.

Another unranked wrestler making the
trip to Oklahoma City is freshman Mikey
Racciato at 149 pounds. Racciato is joined
by Edgar Bright, also a freshman, who is the
No. 14 seed in the 141-pound weight class.

Zanetta, who has qualiﬁed for every
NCAA Tournament in his four years of eli-
gibility, has been helping the young grap-
plers prepare for their ﬁrst trip to nationals.

“It’s important for the freshmen to not
overthink the national tournament,” Zanetta
said. “It is going to be an environment they
have never experienced before, so they must
not get caught up in all the hype.”

While Tasser did not qualify for nationals
as a freshman, he is offering similar advice
to his younger teammates.

“I just tell Mikey and Eddie to soak it all
in. It’s an amazing experience and to be there
as true freshmen is something not many

" people can say,” Tasser said. “Soak it all in,

and don’t hold anything back.”

Despite all of the talk about seniors in
their ﬁnal tournament and freshmenintheir
ﬁrst, two juniors hold Pitt’s best hopes at a

national championship and are expected to

earn All-American honors.

Tyler Wilps enters the tournament as the
No. 7 seed at 174 pounds and Max Thomus—
seit is the No. 4 seed at 184 pounds.

This will be Wilps’ second tournament
and Thomusseit’s third. Being seeded in
the top eight puts a target on their backs,
though. Their opponents know they have to
take down the seeded wrestlers to ﬁnish in
the top eight and earn All-American honors.

With so many Panthers making the trip
to the tournament, the feeling is similar to
other tournaments in which the whole team
is competing. ,

“It’s great having a lot of the guys going,”
Tasser said. “We can go out as a team and
show the fans that the Panthers are here
to compete.” I

ninth whenjon Danielczyk allowed three
runs to cross while recording just one out.
Danielczyk entered with two outs in the

seventh and eighth, but was pulled in favor
of Adam Dian, who put the final twoouts
of the game away and earned his ﬁrst save
of the season.

Danielczyk had already thrown two and

1 decided to stick with him rather than going

to the bullpen, which turned out to not be
the best idea.”

But Danielczyk (2-0) earned the win
while the offense powered the Panthers
ahead for good.‘

The Panthers opened their home sched-

ing 10 runs or more for the ﬁrst time since
2010, which Shelinsky notes helps Pitt
wash the bad taste out of its mouth after
the sweep in Blacksburg, Va., and establish
some good feelings heading into a weekend
series against Duke.

“Going into Virginia Tech we were actu-
allyreally excited, and having leads like
that, then givingthem up, I guess you can
say it kind of hit us hard as a team,” She-
linsky said. “So coming back with two wins
this week really gives us that momentum
going into this weekend, which is huge.”
