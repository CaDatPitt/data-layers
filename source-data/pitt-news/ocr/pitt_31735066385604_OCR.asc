UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council, with the
approval of the director of student activites,
has ignored and violated its own
constitution for at least the past two years.

Members of the PPC’s board of
governors, the body that delegated the
power to make PPC policy and budgetary
decisions, have said that they have never
met, with the exception of interviewing
and evaluating candidates for committee
Chairpersons. All of the governors
interviewed were unsure of their duties,
and none knew the exact number of
people on the board, nor could they name
more than two other governors.

According to the constitution of the Pitt
Program Council, effective May 1, 1982,
and revised Nov. 14, 1985, “the government
of the Pitt Prggram Council shall be vested
in a Board of’Governors and an Executive
Board subject to the regulations of the
Vice- President for student affairs, and the
Director of Student activites.”

The constitution states that the board of
governors “shall receive, review and
approve the PPC yearly budget, approve
and administer any remuneration program,
audit the financial records, approve or
disapprove amendments of the Pitt
Program Council Constitution and receive
and review all complaints against the

PPC.”

The organization’s budget comes directly
from the student activities fee, totaling 35
percent of the revenue from the fee. The

7! budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year for PPC-

«tChinese students upset
over Senate's decision

totalled $316,865.

Asked about the board’s lack of activity,
PPC adviser, T om Misuraca, said that the
board had met and budgets had been
submitted in the past. When told that none
of the governors interviewed had seen a
budget in two years, he replied, “Maybe it

was submitted three years ago.” For the
past four fiscal years, the combined PPC
budgets amounted to $1,218,975.50.

In addition, the board is supposed to
“meet once a month and [hold] special
meetings called by the chairman or six
members of the board of governors.”

Misuraca, PPC student coordinator
Melinda Holben, director of student
activites Joseph Cavalla and associate
director of student activitesjoyce Giangarlo
all claim that the problem is that the
constitution is outdated and needs to be
revised.

Brian Felgoise, currently on the Student
Government Board, was appointed to the
board two years ago and said, “To be
honest, I couldn’t tell you if I was still on
it or not.” He added that he met with
Misuraca “about six times, whenever I
could make it” to evaluate committee
chair candidates.

When read the duties from the
constitution, which he said he has never
seen, Felgoise said, “I had no clue. From
my understanding, when I was asked to
be a governor, I was helping Misuraca
[pick chairsl.”

As far as meeting to discuss PPC policy
or budgeting, he said, “I have never met
in that regard. I didn’t know any of this. If
I had gotten a call from someone, I would
have met.”

Mary Ellen Callahan, who was appointed
to the board in the winter term of 1988,
said, “I only went to organizational
meetings for picking committee chairs,
and in the actual interviewing process.
We probably met all together maybe four
times. I couldn’t make it over some of the
time, and they said it didn’t matter.”

Callahan was out of the country later in
1988. When she returned, she asked “if I
was still doing it, and [Melanie Naro,
former student coordinator] said, ‘Don’t
worry about it.”’

VOLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISUE SEVENTY

..Pz'tt Program Council, violates own constitution

Callahan also noted that she had never
seen the constitution, and that she was
surprised when read the duties from it.

“I’ve never seen any type of accounting
from PPC, and I didn’t realize it was part
of my duties. That was never spelled out
to me once I assumed the role. I thought
lmy"rolel was primarily to have an impartial
judgment for the committee chairs.”

According to current SGB allocations
chairman Gil Borok, “I served on the
board of governors for two years, and as
far as I know, we never met as a board as
such. [There were] parts of the constitution
I didn’t know. In fact, I didn’t even know
who was on the board.

“The only thing I did do as a member of
the board was chairperson interviews.”

Misuraca said that “in the past, governors
were given copies of the constitution
when nominated.”

When asked the number_of people on
the board of governors, Felgoise said
three, Callahan said six and Borok said
nine. According to the constitution, there
are 11 people on the board, including the
student coordinator of the PPC, three
members of the student body appointed
by the SGB, two members of thestudent
body appointed by the vice president for
student affairs, two members selected
from the PPC by the Pitt Program Council
executive board, one staff adviser to the
PPC, one faculty member appointed by

_the president of the university from

nominations by the executive board and
one alumni appointed by the office of
student activites from nominations by the
executive board.

In addition, Felgoise, Callahan and Borok
all said that they had no say in the
decisions for committee chairs and that
Misuraca made the decisions. The
constitution states that all committee
Chairpersons “are selected by a committee
made up of the student coordinator, one

member of the board of governors, one
adviser to the Pitt Program Council and
outgoing director for the particular
committee.”

“We did a paper evaluation,” Borok
said. “The final decision was made by
Tom and the student coordinator. You
never had any say in the final decision.”

Felgoise said, “We gave him inputs, but 

he made the final decision.”

Callahan said that she was never‘;

contacted after the decisions were made
and that she was overruled in some cases
where she thought the candidate should
definitely not get the position.

According to Misuraca, “everyone who
interviews people fills out a form evaluating
them. The final decision is made by [the]
outgoing student coordinator with advice
from me and Dana lKeefer, PPC program
director] and the evaluations.”

He acknowledged that the board did
not meet as regularly as instructed by the
constitution, but said that there was
difficulty in finding people to fill up the
board.

“You have a very difficult time getting a
meeting together. In my four years, I’ve
put out tons of letters to departments,
llooking for governors]. I have a faint
memory of receiving one back who later
decided not to do it.”

Holben said that “we couldn’t get la
board]. People wouldn't commit to it. I can
never get enough people. And there’s no
need for us to meet once a month.”

Both Holben and Misuraca said that
there was a need for a new constitution.

“It needs to be reviewed, ” said Misuraca.
“Everything’s changed. The university’ has
changed; what the students want has
changed.”

“There are a lot of things that are
outdated,” Holben said.

However, there was discrepancy on

For Chinese students at Pitt, the

V Senate’s upholding of President

Bush’s veto of a Chinese student
asylum bill spells disappointment
and uncertainty.

“We are very disappointed
because of the kind of message
that that sends back to the Chinese
government. We want a message
to be sent that the United States
does not approve of human rights
violations, and that is not what
happened with this bill,” said

1‘ Wang Shen, president of Pitt’s

Chinese Students and Scholars
Friendship Association.

The legislation would have
prohibited the deportation of
Chinese students after their visas
expire. Though Bush vetoed the
bill, he issued an executive order
stating that Chinese students who
fear persecution if they return

in

home will not be deported upon
the expiration of their visas.
“President Bush said that he
will allow us to stay until January
of 1994,” Shen said. "I think that
it is kind of ridiculous. He thinks

’ that the bill would have offended

the Chinese government so he
vetoed it. But then he [turned]
around and [issued] an order that
says the same thing that was in
the bill.

“This says very clearly that Bush
is not a man that we can trust,” he
said.

Ceinwen King-Smith, who has
four Chinese students living in
her Squirrel Hill home, said that
Bush’s actions have caused
uncertainty for the students.

“If Bush’s order is subject to
change, then it leaves many
students hanging. Many of them
find it difficult to continue to get

three-month extensions on their

Accidents rise since bus lane closing

 

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

A recent study by Port Authority
Transit has shown an increase in
accidents and injuries involving
pedestrians and motor vehicles
since the May 1989 closing of the
Fifth Avenue bus lane.

The question among critics,
such as County Commissioner
Pete Flaherty, is whether the
previous accidents were a result
of the two-way traffic caused by
the Fifth Avenue bus lane.

“Accidents [as well as] travel
time are up since the Fifth Avenue
[bus] lane closed,” said PAT
spokesman Tom Letky.

Discussed at a Jan. 25 meeting
of PAT were such aspects of the
bus lane as accidents, air
pollution, travel time, congestion
of traffic and purpose of having
the lane.

No decision came out of the
meeting, except that the bus lane
will remain closed until a more
in-depth analysis of the problems
can be researched. PAT officials
have scheduled a meeting for the
second week in February to
further discuss the issues.

“We are taking a second look
at the aspects of the analysis,
[concentrating on] what types of

accidents and other problems’
have occurred,” said Letky.

To date, the study has shown
more accidents on Forbes Avenue
than on Fifth Avenue. Inbound
or — outbound, it takes
approximately 17 minutes longer
to get downtown because of
extreme congestion on Forbes
Avenue.

PAT states that the “crush” of
people on Forbes Avenue is
unsafe because of the large
amount of people waiting on and
around the sidewalks to board
the buses.

Commissioner Flaherty

disagrees though, saying he finds
it hard to believe that it would be
safer having a bus running in a
direction opposite the flow of
regular traffic on Fifth Avenue.
A Flaherty feels that the situation
on Forbes Avenue is fine,
primarily since all traffic moves
steadily and in one direction.

“I often travel [Forbes Avenue],
and I don’t lose any time at all,”
said Flaherty. He said it takes
him from three to ﬁve minutes to

travel from Craft Avenue to Craig I

Street during peak travel hours.

PAT has ‘received many
unsolicited petitions in opposition
to the closing of the bus lane
from elderly and disabled
residents around Pittsburgh.-

Apparently, it has become
much more difficult for them to
visit the hospitals and businesses
on Fifth Avenue since the closing
of the bus lane.

“Thecityisinabitofa
dilemma,” said Letky. “There are
mixed feelings ‘between the
doctors, students and other
people in Oakland.

“Some say no; just as many are
saying yes,” added Letky.

Upon a reopening of the lane,
Letky stated that the city is willing
to extend the steel railing which
runs along Fifth Avenue on the
bus—lane side. .

The extension" would run to
Craft Avenue in order to
supplement the existing guard
rail, keeping pedestrians from
crossing into the path of the buses.

V “Safety is our No. 1 item,” said
Letky. “We do not want to cause
more problems. Instead, we want
to address and answer the
questions from all of the inquiries
as well as the city commissioners.”

According to Flaherty, the issue
will end up, with either the bus
lane or all one—way traffic both
inbound and outbound.

“I would hope that it will turn
out all one-way inbound and
outbound,” said Flaherty.
“Obviously, there will be some
accidents, whether or not they
are because of the buy way.”

“Even though we say one
should look both ways [when
crossing the street], when people
see all [non—bus lane] traffic
ﬂowing in one direction, they
tend not to look to the left [in the
direction of the busesl,” he said.

This is where the situation
becomes dangerous, according
to Flaherty.

‘‘I would be surprised if the
final study showed the contra-
ﬂow lane beneficial,” he added.

Pitt police teach
RAs self defense

Christopher McCall
Staff Writer

Pitt resident assistants learned how to “buy themselves a
minute” when confronted by criminals.

They were involved in a workshop on mental aspects of self-
defense as part of the department of public safety’s efforts to
eliminate crime on campus.

Curtis Smith, a Pitt public- safety officer, created the program
and published a book, Buy Yourself a Minute, aimed at
teaching people how to be aware of possible danger on the
streets.

“I really enjoyed it. I know what [criminals] are looking for
and how to avoid trouble,” said Peggy Swisher, an R.A. in
Holland Hall and a junior majoring in English.

The class involved “making people aware of their surroundings
and things that make us targets of crime,” said Smith.

He explained that the way a person carries his bag, walks, or
simply stands tells a criminal whether or not he’s a possible
victim.

Smith, a Pitt alumnus, was recently designated the American
Training System of Self Defense Martial Artist of 1989.

“The R.A.s only got a taste of my system,” he said. “We held’

a lot of demonstrations. I always get my students involved. In

which members were the
toughest to ﬁnd for board
meetings. Misuraca said that the
alumni and faculty members were
difficult to find, and the student
government people were reliable.
However, Joyce Giangarlo, who
helped construct PPC a decade
ago and was the first PPC adviser,
said it was the student government

, appointees who were unreliable.

Holben said on Jan. 22 that the
student government people might
be eliminated from the board of
governors, but said the next day

. that these appointees were the

most reliable, especially Borok.
Both Misuraca and Holben said

that there was no problem

because the budgets were passed

directly to the director of student
activites, who would have to
approve the board’s decisions
anyway.

“Joe [Cavalla, director of student
activites] does it,” Holben said.
“That’s just the way it’s been.”

“The membership may be
unrealistic,” Misuraca said about
possible constitutional changes.
“The board of governors may be
added to, [or] it may not exist
when [the changes are] finished.”

Since the board of governors is
supposed to approve any
amendments to the PPC
constitution, Misuraca said that
there was a “procedural problem”
and added that he didn't know
how to solve it.

Cavalla said that it could be

changed without the board voting
on it because the rule is not in
effect if the issue voted on is the
future of the board itself.

“T om has tried to pull a board
together," Cavalla said. “He could
not, and I haven’t been on his
back from year to year. Governing
boards are good and bad to me,
and I don’t see [the board] as
something that is overly
necessary.”

He also noted that there were
no problems with checks and
balances because “I'm a check
and balance. The vice president
is a check and balance. Things
don’t get past us."

Cavalla referred to the board as
an “advisory board.” When
reminded of the scope of the
board’s duties, he said, “Well, to
me it’s an advisory board that you
can have if you want.”

In a memorandum from then
director of student activites
William Andrew Smith Jr. to
Giangarlo, dated March 3, 1980,
Smith asked her to “please make
sure that this committee reﬂects
the varied student constituencies
of our student body."

According to a Feb. 29, 1980,
letter from the late Dr. Conney M.
Kimbo, then vice chancellor for
student affairs, to Smith, Kimbo

requested that Smith “develop 

a constitution which shall include
a policy-making and budgeting
board to represent the broad and
varied interests of the Oakland
campus of the University of
Pittsburgh. This governing board
shall have a minimum of three

members to be selected by the

Student Government Board.”

Dennis Donharn, interim vice
president for student affairs since
Kirnbo’s death last year, said that
he was not aware that the
constitution was not being
followed, and said he did not
know that the vice president for
student affairs is supposed to
appoint two governors. However,
he added that “there’s a pretty
complete system of checks and
balances. Unless SGB is bothered,
I wouldn’t be bothered.

“I don’t have any feelings on it.
I don’t know anyone who has the
time to rewrite a constitution, but
I wouldn’t mind if they rewrote
the thing.”

However, a former Pitt student
who worked for both the SGB
and PPC and asked not to be
identified, disagreed.

“PPC doesn’t have the checks
and balances Student
Government does,” he said. “I’m
not saying that PPC is dirty, but

SGB business is in the public eye.
If you want to know what's going
on in PPC, you have to join.”

He added, “I just don’t think
they wanted to [have meetings].
To me it’s ridiculous. You can’t
say ‘nothing’s going on.’ You're
still supposed to meet You don’t
forget a committee that has the
ability to control several hundred
thousand dollars for two years.

‘You can find people all over
the place; you just have to do it.
SGB has to fill 40 to 50 senate
seats, and we were able to do it.
Julie [Shepard] did it, and the year
before Kent [Baldaufl did it. They
put ads in the paper. There are so
many people who would want to
be on [the board]. They could
have had some from [the Black
Action Society]. As long as you
explain” it to them, people will
come.

“Even if you don’t have 11
people, there's still no excuse for
not meeting. If you can’t abide by
the constitution by having 11
people, you could at least abide
by having regular meetings. If

‘[Misuraca’s] not abiding by the

constitution, he's not doing his
job as an adviser.”

Model Literacy Corps Pilot Project.

The grant, one @ 13 awarded
state—wide, was presented by Ellen

“lThe R.A.s’l reactions to the
workshop were extremely
positive. I think they wished it
had only been longer,” said Jon
Conlogue, assistant director of
the Office of Residence Life, which
was partially responsible for
having the Jan. 4 course.

Swisher said, “I am going to
have a self—defense course for my
residents.” She added that she
hopes Smith will teach the
participants.

visas over and over again. This
especially hurts them when they
are looking for a job and have to
tell their employers that they are
only certain that they can stay for
three months. Without an actual
law, things will be very difficult
for them,” she said.

King-Smith has taught English
in China over the summers and

, during vacations. She said that

the atmosphere in China is
considerably calmer since this
summer’s Tiananmen Square
massacre.

“It was a lot quieter there when
I went to teach over Christmas,
but there was a lot of anger
directed against the government,”
she said.

King-Smith believes that the
human issue in China has become

a political issue in this country.

“The focus was taken away
from the students and their plight,
and instead, the vote became a
matter of a power play within our
government,” she said. .

King-Smith said that the age of
the leaders in China provides
hope for students who fear that
they may have to return.

“I think that everyone is just
waiting for Deng Xio Peng to die.
There are a number of leaders in
China who are old and just need
to move out of the way,” she said.

Shen agreed with King—Smith’s
attitude towards China’s
leadership.

“Once they are all dead, the
younger people can start to push
their ideas and I think great
changes will come. Then I would
like to return there,” he said.

Foot injury causes Generalovich  redsbirting

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

At the beginning of this
basketball season, walk-on
freshman guard Brock
Generalovich was seeing more
action than a lot of people
expected. The thought of seeing
him regularly in the Panther lineup
came to an abrupt end when he
injured his foot at the end of
December.

Generalovich only appeared in
two games this season for a total
of five minutes. He contributed
one rebound, but his job was
especially important in practices
until he went down with his foot
injury.

“At first [the Pitt medical stafﬂ
thought it was the same thing that
happened to Sean [Miller],” said
Generalovich. Miller’s injury
occurred where the bones in his
ankle have fused together.
Surgery was required to repair
the problem.

“Wow! I certainly hope my foot
doesn’t require surgery. Sean has
a lot of rehabilitation ahead of
him,” commented Generalovich.

According to Generalovich, he
is about six weeks away from
going full speed. “I’ve been
redshirted for this season. They
told me just to take it easy.”

As for Generalovich’s
rehabilitation, “I’m off my crutches
now. I'll start some work in the
pool to build up the strength, and
then I’ll work on the Lifecycle.
The cycle is going to be tough.”

Generalovich was a star guarc
at Hickory High in Hermitage

Pitt will send nine to NCAA dive qualifiers

By Adam Kamras and
Chris Bosak
The Pitt News

Before Saturday’s men’s
swimming and diving meet
against Villanova, Pitt had one
diver going to the NCAA
qualifying meet on March 9-10 at
the Naval Academy. By the end
of the meet Michael Naylor, Phil
Cruz and Jacob Bourdeau all
joinedJohn Sharkey as qualifiers.

“They did a super job,” said
diving coachjulian Krug. He said
it is outstanding to take four men
to the qualifying meet.

This meet determines who goes
to the NCAA meet to be held on
March 15-17 in Texas. The
qualifying meet boasts the best
divers from various zones. Pitt
will be competing with other
schools from eastern United
States. Only the top divers from
each zone’s qualifying meet go to
the NCAAs,

Since it was the ﬁnal regular-
season meet, it was the last chance
for Naylor, Cruz and Bourdeau to
make it. Sharkey was very pleased
with the way his teammates came
through. “They had to do it today,”
he said. He was confident that

Naylor would qualify, but thought
he would’ve done it sooner.

Before the NCAAs, the divers
will be participating at the Big
East Championships from
February 8-11 atTrees Pool. “Our
team is looking really solid for
the Big East,” said Sharkey. “I
don’t see anybody coming in the
top four ldivingl places besides
Pitt."

Swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw said the divers are so
strong that they may be hurt by
only being allowed to have four
compete in the Big East
Championships. He feels the four
qualifiers plus Brad Buchter could
all score points at the Big East in
two weeks. He said the diving
was the high point of the meet.

Sharkey said he was pleased
with his 1-meter diving on
Saturday but wants to see more
improvement on his 3-meter
diving. He has been working on
a new hard dive for the
postseason.

There are also five members of
the women’s team who have
qualified for this meet. Donna
Flatch, Nicole Bunker, and Krissa
Ratliff have qualiﬁed on the 1-

good, but the team’s individual
records are on the rise.

After this past weekend’s losses
to both Northeastern University

Panthers did as they headed into
their second event vaulting. ‘

“When Gina [Venezia] landed
from her first vault, she munched
her ankle. I told her, ‘That was
your touch, now do your vault,’ “
said Rovee. -

“Then she nailed her second
vault,” added Rovee.

High scores for vault were
turned in by Venezia (9.10), Sleith
(9.0), Butkovich (9.0), Beth Dyson
(8.95), Jorgensen (8.9) and Wallish
(8.85).

The floor exercises provedto
be exciting due to the degree of
difﬁculty in the Pitt squad’s

routines. High scores were turned
in by Taylor and Jorgensen, both
of whom scored 9.50.

Another obstacle that stood in
the Lady Panthers’ path was the
condition of N ortheastern’s mats.
Coach Debbie Yohman said that
she saw two problems with them.

“They were old mats; so they
were soft, and that affects mounts
and dismounts, and they were
small,” said Yohman.

“At the either side of the mat
and the leg of the beam, you had
an empty spot, where they had

“We have a really good girls

By Brandy Simms
For The Pitt News

After almost three months of solid competition, Women’s
Indoor Track coach Steve Lewis said his team is “right on time”
in terms of meeting its goals.

On Saturday they showed why. The team traveled south to
Johnson City, Tennessee to compete in the Bud Lite Invitational.
Freshman phenom Allison Williams took fourth place in the 55-
meter hurdles with a time of 7.87.

In the 400 event, Keisha Demas was an NCAA provisional
qualiﬁer with a time of 54.55. The 4 x 400 relay team of Clarissa
Dudley, Demas, Monica Hockaday, and Ronise Crumpler
finished with a time of 3:41.35, third best in the country.

Success also came to the 4 x 800 relay team consisting of
Hockaday, Crumpler, Demas, and Cathy Chrissos. Their time of
9:09.16 qualiﬁed them for the ECAC championships. Senior
sprinter Vanessa Jones also qualiﬁed for the ECAC championships
with a time of 7.30 in the 55.

The Mobil Grand Prix Invitational awaits the Lady Panthers
on Feb. 3. Lewis said he wants the mile-relay team to qualify for
the national championship and the 4 x 200 relay team to “go
after the school record.”

Lady hoops lose,

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team had a rough
time last week with two Big East losses, dropping
its conference record to 3-5, 11-8 overall.

On Wednesday, Pitt lost to one of the top Big East
teams, Connecticut, 81-68.

The Lady Panthers almost pulled off the upset.
Connie Hurt scored on a baseline jumper with six
minutes left to play to give Pitt a one—point lead. But
the Lady Huskies answered, hitting two three-
pointers to take the lead and forcing Pitt to foul.
Connecticut hit its foul shots to put the game out of
reach. _

Lorri Johnson scored 12 of Pitt’s 27 first-half
points but did not score in the second half. She
played only eight minutes due to foul trouble.

Connie Hurt scored 16 points and grabbed 13
rebounds. Maureen McConnell scored 12 points
and Lisa Fessler had 11.

Kerry Bascom led Connecticut with 23 points.

Coach Kirk Bruce did not attend the game due to

the death of his father. Assistant coaches Kim
Basick and Lisa Faloon took over for Bruce.

Bruce returned for the Villanova game on Saturday,
but Pitt lost 83-67.

“We didn’t have it,” said Bruce. “It was probably
[Villanova’s] best game in the Big East this season.”

Lorri Johnson had 17 points to lead the Lady
Panthers. ,

Bruce believes his team should be at least at the
.500 mark for the season, but the team has not won
any conference games on the road.

Pitt has had three home games and five road
games in the first half of the conference schedule.
But the team makes up for that in the second half
of the Big East season.

Bruce hopes his team’s excellent conference play
at home (3-0) can play a factor in the conference
standings down the stretch.

Pitt played last night at home against nationally
ranked Providence at 6:15. Pitt lost at Providence
98-74 on Jan. 3.

Saturday’s meet showed its toll

on Sunday against New

“They're motivated ‘til the end
of the meet, and they keep the
level of psych up throughout the
whole meet,” said Rovee. “Usually
by the end of the meet, they are
like waste products.”

The Lady Panthers were able to

(9.0).

High scores for the Lady
Panthers on vaults were turned
in by Butkovich (9.0), Sleith (8.95)
and Venezia (8.9).

“Jennifer [Butkovich] came
down and did the best vault she’s
ever done. She said she didn’t
care that the score was low
because she knew it felt great,”
said Rovee.

The Lady Panthers opened the
third leg of the meet with ﬂoor
exercises. The Pitt squad again
proved that floor is its strongest
event by pulling ahead of New
Hampshire 134.55 to 134.40.

“This team can do no wrong on

Leading Pitt was Jorgensen
(9.45), Taylor (9.40), Venezia
(9.30), Wallish (9.10) and
Butkovich (9.05).
