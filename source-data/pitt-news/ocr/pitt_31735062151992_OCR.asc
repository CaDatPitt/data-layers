CCORDING to a "recent. United Press d-is-

’ patch the District of - Columbia “red rider”

. Red _scarcs.haVe always seemed rather silly to
the thoughtful and unprejudiced observer, -and
certainly there is little justiﬁcationxfor, such

-things in educationalcircles. ‘ In the schools, if ,

-anywhere, all political‘ and -economic theories

which are being tried out’! on a large scale should
-be studied impartially. -One can‘ scarcely imag-
.fine_the District of‘ Columbia teachers doing a
_ very" good‘ jobeven on history ,a_nd*geography

during" the past two, years ‘when they ‘had to

«swear every two weeks while collecting their

salary ’checks. that they. had not -mentioned the
dreadful word.“Russia” in the clas__sroor_n.¥~- .
In the United.States, of course, the Red‘M'en-
ace is ‘non-existent save as a. hallucination in the
mind of William~R._ Hearst. The Communist
vote -is negligible in national elections, and not
very manyintelligent folk_’believe that the gov-
ernmentis in"th_e‘ pay of_Mpsc_ow. As yet‘-«even
the._mi-lder wor'dl“socialism” scares most -good
Americans silly.  _ _.  -  -» '
But certainly, if there wer.e ‘actual danger from
Communist propaganda inA_merica a conspiracy
of silence would not be an effective method of
combating it. Even WRI-I doesn’t "make that
mistake. I‘ If Communismfiis not "sLi’ci_¢_:eeding in
Russia, the best way of proving it,__.w'ould be to
present the facts fairly to the inquiring student,
instead of making‘Co_mmunism an exciting busi-
ness to be discussed in hushed whispers along
with sex and other fascinating subjects. Ameri-

:can]democracy wouldjbe pretty poor stuff if it

could-not stand up under attacks: from contrast-
in "Vdoctrincs. _ ,   ,_' 

' n a;demo_crac_y it is imperative that the edu-
cation of the average citizen_ include some
knowledge of government and politics, and this
knowledge can have little validity if itincludes
only ‘the political views a majority in Congress
agrees with, and excludes all -«controversial is-_
sues. Shutting the mouths of teachers is hardly,
a way to insure clear thinking on the part of the
coming generation." We are glad that the sud-

F rom The ‘Pages Of A

(College .Ma1i’s ‘Diary :  

_ .xLe'tha'i'”gy Arid Hard. Work ;

,A man the other _night—we all know- him—
struck something that was so close to hitting the
nail of education squarely ~on'the head that it
should be echoed and re-“echoed in all of our col-

legcs and universities. He said: “Life holds one

of two things, ‘either disappointment or hard
work . A. 1"’ The principle of hard work has always

built up from seeming helplessness.

While good, clear thinking is probably the

‘most difficult of labors, it is often the only way

"out of those helpless situations. To concentrate
on one object, one idea, to _hold that concentra-

-tion,_and then to draw co_nclusions—all this wt’

must do to arrive at any sort of mental content-
ment. ’ »

-up our "conclusions by combining them, or pick-

ing them,ap_ar.t, piece by piece, -then we perhaps

"have" ‘imagination. -Imagination, in turn, leads

to creation, and in being cre-ative our hopes are
realized.  If constancy, repeated and untirmg

effortcontinue, then’ we swing onto the "road of‘

contentment and satisfaction. Our tread is
faster, our- heart lighter, and the earth and every.-
thing in it seems good. Perhaps. .

In education, achievement and the later prac-
tical a_pp’licatioii of that achievement depend on
hard work. “Getting the breaks” has‘ very little

to do with it. ,An intelligent attitude and clear

vision towards the prospective "problem, throws
the wheel of chance out of gear, and" changes
the disorder of luck to the order of well-directed
certainty. . '. . ' I ' —

But What Tomorrow?

7' All this is idealistic optimism, and is meant
’-to be such. v Sometimes we like to fool ourselves,

to bolster our own doubtful spirits with ideals
while in reality it isonly the hand-to-hand skir-
mishes, the pleasant smack of contact, thelove
of battle that keeps us charging ahead. All this
has the characteristics of hard work, yet we gen-
erally see itin a different light. In reflection.
we—may admit that weare cheap imitations of
someone‘ in; whom we recognize qualities which
we aspire "to, and thus we attempt to do the
same things that he has already done. But this,
too, is ‘hard: work, sometimes. ‘Tomorrow shall
be a holiday. ' On that day we shall shuffle our
cards in apelssimism of reality. But today let
us play with gilt-edge aces and kings, and get
down to hard work. '

Ode To The F ootiball Classic

(Ec_1itoi"s Note: The’following‘ was received from one
of the "many friends of the University football squad on
its recent trip to the Coast. It was addressed to Dr. Suth-
erland, “Coucli," and then forwarded to The News.):

Rose'Bowl, New Year, 1937

' -And give~-.‘.‘Ti‘ojaiis” a bitter cup.
You may carry off all honors
For the whole Paciﬁc Coast.
‘And a bid for national greatness,
May bc_youi' proudest" boast.
No doubt your team is mighty,
From all that we have heard;
Can “pass” and “kick”'and “buck” the line
I With the” swiftn~ess' of a bird.
But “Pitt” has ne’er forgotten
I ' That Rose Bowl New Year fray; '
The “rout” those‘ "Ti'ojans” gave her
Four years ago today. '
Thrice beforethe “I‘anthei's"' came,
To conquer, do or die: '
But homeward went with saddened heart,
No victory in the sky.

‘How Daddio snared-7 that mighty “pass”

League Battle Tonight

Navy Passers Become Sixth
Straight Victim Of Pitt
Cage Team, 35-28

 

Floating along over the sixth
victory wave, Pitt’s Golden
Panthers sailed right by the
Navy Saturday afternoon when
‘they we nt into Annapolis and
meshed out a 35-28 triumph over an
able service team.

When Dr. Carlson made “Win ’em
all in 1937” his first New Year’s
resolution, he evidently wasn’t fool-
ing; Saturday’s win was the sixth
in succession for the Panthers and
left their record for this calendar
year unblemished.

It has been a strong secon-d half
surge that has been, in analysis, the
big factor in Pitt’s success. Rein-
forced» by sturdy replacements and
also a real ﬂghtingheart the Pan-
thers have picked up their power after
thc intermission. This was equally
true Saturday against the Navy.

-Carlson’s starting team consistedof
second stringers with Frank Loucks
and Luke Rowe at forwards, Joe
Fabel at center, and Ed Spotovich
and Sam Lindsayat guards. With
Fabel pacing the ‘scorers, this com-
bination left theﬁool‘ at the comple-
tion of the first half with a“ narrow
14—13- lead over the Midshipmen.

Mr. Garcia Goes To Town.

Regulars Jesko, Zeleznik, Garcia,
J ohnson,’ and Radvansky steamed into
the second half and steamed on out
of ' Annapolis with the ‘ball game.
Without so much as taking ‘time to
get accustomed to the new surround-
ings, J_oe Garcia, whose play in the
past couple of games has been as hot
as the Spanish Revolution, arched
through two ﬁeld goals from the foul
line to shoot Pitt into the lead and
to give the ﬁrst genuine evidence of
Pitt’s supremacy. .

From then on Navy had about as
much chance of winning as there is
likelihood of Mr. Hitler swimming
the'A-tlantic. The play was fast and
furious, how_cve1',‘but it didn"t take
longfor Pitt’s points to roll up just
that way. With about ﬁve minutes
left in the game, the.Panthe1‘s were
33-21 away. It was just a cruise
from ‘then into the last whistle.

Saturday was Navy day for the
Pitt center duo. Joe Fabel, playing
in the first half at the tip-off posi-
tion, tossed in three. ﬁeld goals and
three fouls for a sum total of nine
points. Joe Garcia, Pitt’s other Joe
center, went into. the battle» in the
secondhalf and likewise rolled up
nine-points. His cameby virtue of
four goals from the court and.one
free;throw shot. These scoring feats
were. matched by Navy’s~ste1lar per-
former, Alan MacFa_rland,~ ﬂashy for-
ward,’ who also scored-nine.

Engi.necr- Basketball League.
Gets Under Way Today

To furnish relief from sliderules
and equations, the Engineering Asso-
ciation» devised the Engineers’ Hoop‘
League, an annual affair, several
years ago. This afternoon the 1937.
edition of "the basketball "tourney will
get under way on the Trees Gym
ﬂoor, with -the. combined Aeronautical-
and Mechanical Engineers’ team meet-
ing the Chem Engineers at 4:30
o’clock.-

The tourney is sponsored by the
EA Association Cabinet, but Martin
J. Feely, intramural sports sponsor,
will supervise the. affair. When the
annual series was initiated several
years ago the association-puta-cup
into circulation with the stipulation
that the ﬁrst group to capture it
three times would gain permanent
possession. The Chem Engineers,
winners of the tourney last year, al-
ready have two-legs on the cup and
will be out there this year to make
it their own, but ‘they will meet stiff
competition from the industrial and
civil engineers, who also have one
leg on the cup.

There will be three games this
week, Monday, Wednesday and Fri-
day, and then the next will not be
played until February 5, the tourney

semester examinations.

SURPRISE!

.  NYA Pay Ch'e'c_ks._' ;
" Cut Last Week“ '

   

Were University NYA workers sur
prised last week when they opened
their pay envelopes?"' The answer is
yes. Instead of ﬁnding checks for
the amount earned, students saw that
the pay had been drastically reduced.

But now NYA ’workers know the
bad news. It seems that the federal

allotment for the month of Decem-p

ber was less than-it should have been;
As a result, the pay of all workers
was deducted, in some cases as much
as 25 per cent. -

Because the shortage of federal
funds is "likely to continue, all NYA-
workers who have been working 3'7
hours per month will be reduced to
30 hours,‘ and students working 60
hours pe1' month will be reduced to
50, beginning this month.
