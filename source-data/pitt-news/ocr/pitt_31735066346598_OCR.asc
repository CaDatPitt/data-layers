Fees Adjusted

Students With 16-20
Credits Pay Flat $600 .

By BARRY GROSS

Engineering students at the University will pay
a ﬂat tuition rate of $600 a trimest.er for 16 through
20 credit hours, starting in September.

E. K. Pinneo, director of admissions for the Uni-
versity, said he hoped this would act as an incen-
tive to attract new students to the University. Two
other factors he feels will help attract more stu-
dents are the trimester system and the image of

the University.
“In the past year, probably bee

creased recruiting and the work done by our pub-
ilc relations department, the University and the
trimester system have gained national importance,”

Pinneo said.

will follow the pledge period.

But he also feels that increased
tuition and the closing of Busi-
ness Administration to entering
freshmen will act to keep some
students away.

Admissions for the April tri-
mester are running about the
same as last year. At this time
last year 48 freshmen and 50
advanced standing students had
applied. Now, 45 freshmen and
38 advanced student applica-
tions are in. l

“The period from January
through April always has the least
applications for admission,” the
director said. Last year a total of
206 applications were made, so
we’re running at the same rate
and there have been no changes in
procedure,things should be about
the same.”

Fall Applications Down V

Application for the fall trimes-
ter are more involved. Last year
at this time, there were 2100 ap-
plications in. This year 1400 have
been received.

“While this would seem to be
an alarming decrease of one
third. the amount of applica-
tions in 1961 was atypical and
due to traceable factors,” Pin-
neo explained.

He mentioned an article in an
October 1961 issue of Life which
discussed applications to colleges.
The University was listed as hav-
ing “easy admissions, willing to

announced at Monday's SG meet-
ing.

SG President Richard Sobota

disbandment of the governing
body will also be offered. A ques-

matter further.

Avoids Partisanship
Menzer announced the members
of his committee were “selected
purposely from neither the Senate

avoid any partisanship.” The
members are Linda Leebov, Gail

On the suggestion of Ray

Reaves, Jay Fingeret appointed

Professor Cooke Bids ’
For State House Seat

By IVIATTHEW NESVISKY

Dr. Edward A. Cooke, associate professor of ‘political sci-
ence, announced this week that he would possibly be a can-
didate for the State legislature.

Cooke is a resident of Oakmont, which is in the 16th leg-
islative district. The area also includes Penn Hills, Turtle

Creek and Wilkinsburg.

An author and life-long student
of politics, Cooke is "not new to
campaigning for public office. Last
year, he lost the race for borough
council on the Democratic ticket
by less than 150 votes, although
the area registration ﬁgures show-
ed 1100 more Republicans than
Democrats.

One of C00ke’s publications is
“Pennsylvania Politics,” a paper-
back guide to the modern gov-
ernmental organization of our
State. A more recent writing is
a small pamphlet which appeared
last March entitled “Research: An
Instrument of Political Power.”

The essay was a criticism of
the administration and pur-
poses of the Pennsylvania Econ-
omy League in civic and state-
wide levels. This writing later
appeared in the Political Sci-
ence Quarterly.

Having kept this active eye on
politics, Cooke announced Monday
that he would be “happy to run as
a Democratic candidate im the
16th legislative district if there is
an opening.”

His district elects four mem-
bers to the lower House of the
General Assembly,‘ and at present
all are Democrats. There is, how-
ever, one of the county’s largest
Republican strongholds located
there.

Cooke has been with the Po-
litical Science department at
the University for seven years
as an associate professor. Last
year, he was associated with the
student presidential poll, the re-
sults of which were strikingly
similar to that of the actual
November election.

Dr. Cooke earned his PhD. at
Northwestern University. At pre-
sent, he is conducting a course in
Pressure Groups, Propaganda and
Public Opinion. The course is de-
voted to the study of practical
politics in modern dynamic so-

cieties.

Liberal Arts

Probation

Totals 7 50

Figures Include

C Grade Records

By MARILYN EIGES
Preliminary ﬁgures receiv-
.ed from the School of Liberal
_Arts show that approximately
750 of the 2866 students en-
rolled therein are now listed
as being on probation.

However, Russel A. Dixon, as-
sistant dean of the School of Lib-

putting too much reliance upon
"these ﬁgures. The numbers should
be considered merely as a raw
compilation until a ﬁnal correct-
ed form is issued on February 15.
“The list of probationers, as it
now stands, contains a large num-
ber with G grades included in
their transcripts,” Dixon said.

These incomplete grades must

with a standard grade within a
six week period ending Febru-
ary 3.

“In these cases,” he continued,
the ﬁnal grade might segve to lift
the student off probation. Con-
ceivably, students not now on pro-
bation might be placed there on
completion of G grades.”

Included in this preliminary list
might also be included students
who have since withdrawn from
the University. The number of
students in this category has not
yet been compiled.

A similar reﬁned list for the
fall of 1960, with all corrections
having been made, shows that
515 of the 3134 Liberal Arts
students were on probation.

According to Dixon, the number
of G grades given last term great-
ly exceeds that of any previous
term. These grades are more and
more being given out on the
slightest provocation or whim of
the student. If these grades serve
no other purpose than an easy
out for a lazy student, policy on
their distribution will have to be

strengthened, Dixon said.

Odetta Sings Thursday

Almost all free tickets for folk

Pinneo.

- Many Rejected

“This tended to bring in a con-
siderable number of unqualiﬁed
applicants,” he continued. “With-
out changing standards, we had to
reject many more students than
usual.”

Another reason, the admis-
sions director feels, is that, be-
cause of increased prestige, the
University came into competi-
tion with the more prestigious
universities.

“Students who were well-qual-
iﬁed placed the University as
their second or third choice, and
many of them notiﬁed us that they
had been accepted by their ﬁrst
or second choices even though
they had also been accepted here.”

Acceptances Dropped

For the past few years 61 per

cent of students accepted ended

"up going to school here. Last year

the ﬁgure dropped to 49 per cent.
Pinneo recognizes “a tenden-

cy among local students to try
to go away to school.”
The factor of increased tuition

A rates has been overemphasized, he

feels. Pinneo listed other private
institutions in the state in order
to compare their tuition for in-
state students with that here.
Rates Compared
Other tuition rates are: Car-
negie Tech, $1200 per year; Penn,

Classics Professor

By RAISIIA SILBERMAN

Students of Dr. Arthur M.
Young’s classes in the Depart-
ment of Classics receive much
more than a textbook education
in classical subjects.

Dr. Young, head of the Depart-
ment of Classics at the University,
has very definite opinions about
transferring his knowledge of his
ﬁeld to his students.

“I often wonder how anyone

' can teach Latin or Greek without

having been to see Italy and
Greece and to meet their people,”
muses the short, quiet professor,

 as he recalls his many journeys

to the lands of the origins of
Western history. -
Serves on Board
Dr. Young has been traveling
to the countries of his specialty
since his days as a student. His
ﬁrst foreign sojourn was as a
student at the American Aca-
demy in Rome. His first visit to
Athens was to study at the Amer-
ican School of Archaeology in that
city. He is now on the Board of
Directors of the School and serv-
ed as a professor there three years
ago. —.
Young has returned to Europe
numerous times since his stu-
dent days, to visit and to study.
In his own words, “when you
get to know a country, you feel
that it is your second home.”
The professor’s last visit to Eu-
rope was two summers ago when
he took a group of his own stu-
dents to “see the original places
about which they had studied.”
Uses Slides
In order that his students at the
University can gain the most
beneﬁt from his experience,
Young uses slides and pictures
that he has taken as part of his
instruction.

L Adds to ‘Book Learning’

Dr. Young has received some
interesting side beneﬁts in his
many visits to the ancient lands.
While serving his professorship
at the American School in Ath-
ens, he used to accompany the
archaeologists up to the Acrop-
olis to ‘observe their investiga-
tions.

One day, on_ the Acropolis, Dr. ,

Young had the unexpected good
fortune to meet Miss Elizabeth
Taylor and the late Michael Todd.
The professor accompanied the
couple on a tour of the Acropolis,
giving them the advantage of his
years of study. He recalls the in-
cident with a smile, saying, “one
never knows who one will meet
in Athens. So many people come
to see it.”
Writes Book

Dr. Young returned to Europe
in April to research his latest
book, “Echoes of Two Cultures.”
The book discusses how culture
has been handed down from
Greece and Rome.

The professor sums up his

years of travel and devoted

study in the following words.

“Greek culture echoes down
through the ages. It has inspired
the hands and hearts of creators
in every age. We must ﬁnd the
living strength of the subject. One
should get to the place where the
strength is./"

 The Wonder Drug

S Approximately 96 students have been dismissed from
this University each” year since 1959 for academic reasons.
In that time many more students managed to keep from
following their contemporaries out the door with that
Wonderful invention, the G grade.

Better than any penicillin shot, the G grade has replac-
ed the aspirin as the panacea for all stomach upsets caused

, by over-cramming before ﬁnal exams, nervous tension re-
sulting from last minute papers and ‘nagging headaches ,

due to loss of sleep.

. Now students need no longer fear probation from these
anxiety-producing maladies. The G grade allows them a
six-week period to recover time lost or wasted with no
unpleasant afteraffects. Of the 750 students presently on
the preliminary probation list, there is a good chance that
many of them --will return to good standing with completion
of the G grade. e

To the unsuspecting student such a cure-all is most de- '

sirable. But G grades are contagious and can become habit-

forming, as is evidenced by this year’s ﬁgures. More G‘

grades have been given this past term than many preced-
ing it.‘And as one student has woefully boasted this is his
third term under such conditions. The ﬁrst G put him be-

hind and he cannot now “catch up.”

The most frightening thing in this case is the extent
to which G grades are used. It’s theold story» of supply and
demand. The more students demand a G grade, the more
teachers and professors feel pressured to supply that de-
mand so that the G grade is no longer a privilege granted

, the ailing student, but a need to keep him in school.

\

Students and faculty alike realize that education can-
not be measured in terms of so-many 15 week periods. But
so must they be aware that part of any education is in
learning to accept responsibility. If the trimester system
calls for a more concentrated effort earlier in the year, then
it’s time we all started concentrating.

It is hardly feasible that the student body
could give more than a moment’s thought to the
Reaves-Slotkin plan. These senators propose that
by changing the representation, making the pres-
ident attend all‘ Senate meetings——-having no vote
all the while, and limiting his activities outside the
glorious range of ‘Student Government that the
utopian peace and respectability they lack will
rush for the senatorial chambers. They would
build a house onlground that has seen many houses
come tumbling down and think that by adding
democratic top soil to the lot that the foundation
will hold their particular. house. I'm afraid not.
Second Plans Co-‘éordination

The second plan, which someone has attributed
to the President, is, if owning no other virtue,

fresh *and.entirely feasible. In proposing that the

presidents of the various existing governing groups
ban together and replace the present SG, Mr. So-

‘bota or somebody has recognized that there is ab-

solutely no need, either self-evident or theoretical,
for an additional governing body on this campus,\_. gg;
but that there is a slight lack of co-ordination ' 
among the already existing ones. . ~
All the governing powers that any student could
want over another student have been three—fold 
delegated to functioning groups, boards, and indi-I A if
viduals. There is no governing left tobe done,‘
leaving us with the current denothingness andi
pettiness of SG. < .. ,

With few exceptions, the majority of the body’s*'
major decisions in the past year have been those
of parliamentary procedure which Somebody Rob.
erts decided in his Rules of Order some years ago, V.
They are not totally to blame, for what else canlka".
governing group with no powers and nobody to
govern do at a weekly meeting? _

How necessary is this co—ordination which we
lack? And further, whom are we trying to, cos.
ordinate? Student with student? This is impossible
for we are not an ivy-covered closet and individu-
ality is and should be _one of our strongest points.
Student with faculty co-ordination is accomplished "
on a personal level, and time has proved that stu-
dent co-ordination with administration is virtually
impossible at a level higher than now exists, whi)ch 
is accomplished through personal or group inﬂu- 
ence. .

Student Sounding Board? ‘

The only other reason for the existence of a
student representative group is to act as a “stu-
dent sounding board” for student, opinion. Should
then we organize a group for ﬁreside chats con-
cerning student opinion. No. Student opinion
amounts to little more than grumbling without
reason. —

' When the need for strong, united student opin-
ion arises, which is infrequent, the existing govern.
ing groups are -more than sufficient to express them
and will do so with the necessary co-ordination-—
without the aid of an elite presidents club.

The point _is,- whenthe referendum comes, con-
sider the two plans presented and save future stu- 
dents the trouble that has faced us and those be-

S   Rags to

Reality

“A Pocketful of Miracles” is a movie which re-
veals the American way of looking at life. There
are no adolescent crooners; there are no scenes of

f passionate love at ﬁrst sight; there is not even. a

man with an attache case. ‘But
the movie is undeniably and ir-
revocably American.

Thegplot is simple: An old
beggar woman who sells apples
in Manhattan has an illegitimate
daughter living in Spain who is
engaged to a member of the
Spanish nobility. The woman, 
Apple Annie, has been sending '
her daughter money, and has led 5‘

 

a wealthy old dowager staying -
at the Marbury Hotel with her- wealthy second
husband. The crisis comes when the daughter de-
cides to come home and introduce her ﬁance, to
her parents. Apple Annie despairs and nearly kills
herself with too much gin. Her salvation comes in
the form of a New York gangster who has always
depended on her apples for luck. His ﬁnancial aid
enables her to live at the Marbury for a week,
while the daughter and her ﬁanceyisit. The hoax
proves successful and they are both‘ on the boat
before Annie changes back, into her peddler’s rags‘.
__ It is a pretty story; it islin technicolor; and
Bette Davis is'a great actress who lends grace and
dignity to rags. But there. is something missing
which leaves one vaguely disturbed. It is’ a
morality play and one is supposed to go away hap-
pily assured that goodltriumphs over evil and that
gangsters are innocent enough to believe in magic
apples. A '
Lacks Reality _ -
However, the point of the .movie has been ob-
scured, or perhaps it was never there in the ﬁrst
place. Nothing in this world —‘ not a week at the
Marbury Hotel, not a marriage to a Spanish Count
-— can make up for the human inﬁrmity of which
Apple" Annie is the symbol. She and her cohorts
in the movie are the beggars of Broadway. ‘Some
have no legs; some are deaf mutes; some are mid-

gets. And the legless man cannot ..go into the

dressing room and put ‘on his legs, just as the
midget cannot become tall after the movie has,
been ﬁlmed. L And in life as it is really lived Apple

' Annie would have stayed herself. Even if the week

long Cinderella story had come true, it would have
made. no real difference. A week at the Marbury
does not compensate for a lifetime in the gutter.

A good movie, like any good art form, must
ring true.‘ One. cannotbe able to nod one’s head
at?» the conclusion and say “Yes, this is the way
things are.” or else, the movie must have a con-
sistency of vision which “is powerful enough so
that the question of . verisimilitude never really
arises. “At-‘Pocketful of Miracles” has neither of
these attributes. It refuses to face the truth of
man’s estate, the fact that there is irremediable
l00VeI‘ty and suffering, and it shapes reality to ac-
cord with the desires of the public. No one goes

' home feeling pangs of conscience; the movie has a

happy eT1di1”lg- Apple Annie does not put back on
her b€§€ar’s rags until all the movie-goers are safe

cocktails.

Redemption Not Falsification

_’ The point is that there are. some things in the
wor'1d.,,which cannot be redeemed even by Holly-
wood and the neighborhood theatre. Redemption
of reality is very? different from falsiﬁcation of the
real.— One comes through confrontation and the
other comes throughﬂinsensitivity. The producers

I of the movie and the viewers of the movie were in-

sensitive to the plight of Annie. Her situation and

movie about poverty and suffering, "it should stick

that the student body vote _on

tions. This was passed, and the
Publicity Committee was as-
signed to handle the details of
the election.

“One of the most pressing needs
on this campus,” said Reaves, “is
to get WPGH through the dorms.”
He suggested that Student Gov-
ernment pay half, the cost of
a coaxial cable which would
strengthen the station’s signal en-

ough to reach the residence halls.-

The cost to the Senate could not
exceed $300.

Nathan Firestone said that
the station’s advisory council
will not be able to consider the
matter until next week. He
suggested that the proposal be
tabled until the next meeting.
The Senate agreed. .

Jay Fingeret reported that at
a recent Druid luncheon both stu-
dents and faculty questioned the
absence of a student directory
this year. Adams suggested pos-
sible reasons — ﬁrst, that there
seems to be no need, and second-
ly, that the book has not sold.

was suggested to reduce costs.

Students Form
Group to Discuss
Marxist Ideals

Thirty campus students met on
Thursday and organized a Marxist
discussion group; According to the
group’s chairman, Steve Ryack,

the group was founded because

of interest expressed by many
students in Marxism, and because
of the unavailability of a, formal
course apart-from the University
curriculum.

“Agreement with the principles

of Marxism is not a criterion for
membership,” Ryack pointed out.
“This is not an action group. We
are“a group of students interested
in investigating a certain mode of
thought.” i

In response to questions con-

cerning official recognition of the A

group, Ryack pointed out that

A initial response to the organiza-

tion was encouraging. “If the
group is going to be received
well,” he said, “it will have to
project itself as an intellectual
group.” He added further that
“We have on our side academic
freedom. We are not an action
group. We are satisfying a real
need which exists in almost all
colleges and Universities.”

The group meets every other
Thursday.‘ at 7:30 p.m., and the
next meeting will be held on
February 1.

IS STUDYING NECESSARY ?

Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter
Pellucid, C-asimir Fing, and LeRoy Holocaust and they were all
taking English lit. and they were all happy, friendly, out-going
types a.nd they all smoked Marlboro Cigarettes as you would
expect from such a gregarious trio, for Marlboro is the very es-
sence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, and very soul of
concord, with its tobacco so mild and ﬂavorful, its pack so
king—size and ﬂip-top, its ﬁlter so pure and white, and you will
ﬁnd when you smoke Marlboros that the world is ﬁlled with the
song of birds and no man’s hand is raised against you.

Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and LeRoy went
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat
in sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty

and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and sobbed them- "

selves to sleep. . '

This joyless situation obtained all through the first semester.
Then one night they were all simultaneously struck by a mar-_
velous idea. “We are all studying the same thing,” they cried.
“Why, then, should each of us study for three hours? Why not
each study for one hour? It is true we will only learn one-third
as much that way, but it does not matter because there are
three of us and next June before the exams, we can get together
and pool our knowledge!”

Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and LeR.oyl

They ﬂung their beanies into the air and danced a gavotte and
lit thirty or forty Marlboros and ran out to pursue the pleasure
which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from their lives.

Alas, they found instead a series of grisly misfortunes.
Walter, alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady
with a coed named Invicta Breadstuﬂ’, a handsome lass, but,
alas, hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled
ﬁve hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor VVa.lter’s
thumb was a shambles and his purse was empty, but Invicta.
just kept on bowling and in the end, alas, she left Walter for a’
pin-setter, which was a terrible thing to do to VValter, especially
in this case, because the pin-setter was autoinatic.

VV-alter, of course, was far too distraught to study his English
lit, but he took some comfort from the fact that his roommates

were studying and they would help him before the exams. But

Walter, alas, was wrong. His roommates, Casimir and LeRoy,
were nature lovers a.nd they used their free time to go for long
tramps in the woods and one night, alas, they were treed by
two bears, Casimir by a brown bear and LeRoy by a kodiak,
and they were kept in the trees until spring set in and the
bears went to Yellowstone for the tourist season. -

So when the three roommates met before exams to pool their
knowledge, they found they had none to pool! Well sir, they had
a good long laugh about that and then rushed to the kitchen
and stuck their heads in the oven. It was, however, an electric
oven and the effects were, on the whole, beneﬁcial. The wax in
their ears got melted and they acquired a healthy tan and
today they are married to a lovely young heiress named Gang-
lia Bran and live in the Canal Zone, where there are many nice
boats to wave at. aim Max Shulmal

tut C

In case you worry about such things, their wife is a Marlboro
smoker, too, which adds to the general merriment. Marlboro
is ubiquitous, as well as ﬂavorful, and you can buy them in
all 50 states as well as the Canal Zone.

Sports Editor

 

CROWN OF THORNS

TA button-down shirt collar seemed to be choking the almond-
shaped Adanfs apple on Rodney Thorn’s turkey-leg neck. He spoke
ﬂuently, however, despite the harsh pressure on his esophogaus.

Rod Thorn was dressed strictly Ivy League. Why not. He’s a
Princeton man. Princeton, West Virginia that is. Rod’s not acclaimed
for the cut of his dress clothes, however, but rather for the skills
which he displays when wearing a ﬂimsy nightshirt for the West
Virginia University basketball team.

Boney Bicycle Pedals

Playing as if he had been living on benzedrine, Thorn personally
beat the visiting Panthers, 88-78 at the notorious Mountaineer Field-
house. Running with an odd-looking, stilted motion, his bony

shoulders bobbing up to the lobes fo his big ears like bicycle pedals,

Thorn slid past the fastest of the
Pitts. shot. over the outstretched
hands of their tallest men, and
padded his 25-point a game aver-
age with his seventh 30 plus
output.
Like Janus, he could look two
“ways at once, often did, and hit
hf: teammates for quick, easy
scores’. Now he was scratching a
neck that obviously separates his
head from his shoulders, sitting
alone in the dressing room. _
Rod ‘(horn He’ has wiry blonde hair,
something like Danny Kaye’s, and a-slightly cleft chin. He is a
strong candidate for All-America honors. He’s only a junior. He
was also considered last year, but he didn’t make the grade.

Does this status affect Thorn? “Last year it ‘bothered me,” he
said, with the slightest touch of a Southern accent in his voice. “But
now if I’m good enough I’ll make it!"

Rod is a good student —— B plus -— and he’s serious about his
studies. He’s serious about his basketball, too, and last year these
two aspirations had a ﬁerce rivalry, tugging away at the soul of
Thorn. Other sportswriters would have you believe fromgtheir ac-
counts, that Thorn cracked under ._the pressure. He merely dropped
out of school to ease the tension. ‘ I
Non-Freudian ,_ "

“This year it doesn’_t occupy a place in my mind," he said. “Last
year I let it get the best of me, a lot worse than I should have. The
sportswriters overexaggerated it a bit, that Freudian idea,

“Lotta ballplayers have troubles like mine -- some probably
Worse. I just couldn’t cope with the situation,” he exclaimed.

“This year if I’m not good enough, I’m just not good enough,”
he remarked. This year he was good enough to make the all-tourna-
ment team in the Los Angeles Classic, a round-robin extravaganza
which ruslled the ‘best in basketball to the coast. ‘

There was Ohio State’s Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek,
.Purdue’s Terry Dischinger, Utah's Billy McGill, USC’s John
Rudometkin, and there was Rod Thornmpopping in 66 pointsin
two games and snagging 28 rebounds, even though he is only
6-ft., 4-in. and 175 pounds.

“That Lucas is the greatest ever,” Thorn offered. “What a team
player. Dischinger didn’t even seem like he was out there even
thoughwhe scored 32 points against us.” V When Thorn was out West
he was compared to West. It wasn’t a geographical resemblance, but
rather his similarity to Jerry West of the pro Lakers club, an
alumnus of WVU.

How does Thorn feel about the comparison?
that's gonna happen,” he said. “I overlook it. I think that West is
the greatest his size. I don’t worry about being as good as he is. I’ve
a long, long, long way to go. Those sportswriters just have to have
something to write about.”

No Colﬁparison

Mountaineer Coach George King shuns comparisons. “Rod’s per-
formances rate with themselves. You don’t have to compare him to
anyone." How does he rate with the one-time pro great George
King? “Ah, hell, compare him, I’d hardly have a chance to get on
the floor nowadays,” he says. “I don’t even know what it smells
like, it’s been so long." .

There is a lot of fantasy connected to the tales of Rod Thorn,
except those of his basketball prowess. He’s not a hillbilly, either.
“I think our state sorta has a reputation /for being backward.
They ﬁgure we’re a bunch of guys from small towns in hills and
backwoods. It's just natural.”

Meanwhile it just seems natural that Thorn’s shots swish the
nets. “More conﬁdence this year,” he says. “I used to quit shootin’.
Now if I miss I shoot a little more and the law of averages is bound
to catch up with me.” It sure does.

straight game this Saturday
when they travel to Boston to
play a high-scoring Boston
College quintet for the third

‘time in the school's history. Two

years ago these same teams split,
the Panthers’ winning the regu-
lar season game and BC a Christ-
mas tournament game.

The Eagles of coach Don Martin
have gone over the century mark
a few times this season. One of
these times was against a very
fine Yale team whom they defeat-
ed 109-96 at the El.i’s Payne Whit-
ney Gym.

Coach Martin has a veteran
squad headed by 6’ senior guard
Chuck Chevalier and 6’5” senior
forward Jim Hooley. Chevalier
has been likened to Bob Cousy
when he went "to Holy Cross. At
times this year._,he has been so
fancy that his own teammates
could not keep up with him,

Hooley Tops

In Hooley, BC has their top
scorer and rebounder. Although
Bob Timmons’ boys will have to
stop this duo if they are to be
successful, they cannot afford to
overlook guard Jerome Power and
forwards Bill Foley and Jerry
Ward.

Coach Timmons has stressed
that this is an important game
and the boys will have to be at
their best to win “We’ll be
working on defense for the most
part,” commented the solft-
spoken mentor. “As for our de-
fense, it will depend on whether
they use a man-to—man or zone
type defense.” ,

Stopping a minute to point out
a mistake to a player Timmons
continued, ‘.‘I plan to start the

ﬁeld continues to lead the Pan-
thers in scoring, although “The
General” has closed the gap in
the last two games.

The 6’6” muscleman from
Farrell showed signs of coming
out of a mid-season slump when
he scored nine points and grab-
bed 14 rebounds against West-
minster. In the Columbia game
he counted 29, while he poured
31 through the hoop at West
Virginia.

Let’s hope that “The General"
and the rest of the squad can con-
tinue their progress, boost their
record to 10-6, and come back
from Boston holding a lifetime
advantage of 2-1 over the Eagles.

 

For Third Win
In 4th Outing

By BOB SMIZIK

Northwestern wre stlin g
Coach Ken Kraft recently
gave this opinion on his
wrestling team, “If we can
stay even with our oppo-
nents through the ﬁrst ﬁve

weights we should be in a 800d
position to take charge in the final
three events.”

With the strength Pitt has in the
lower weight classes it is doubt-
ful if Northwestern can “stay

‘ even” with the Cats in the first

ﬁve matches when the two teams
meet on Friday at 3 p.m. in the
Field House.

Wildcats Bob Plaskas, Tom
Wonders, and Tim Runnette do
not appear to be in the same class
with Panthers Rich Martin, John
Zolikoﬂ and Daryl Kelvington in
the 123, 137 and 147 pound divi-
sions.

157 Up for Grabs

Sherm Moyer’s match with
John Huffman at 130 pounds can
be considered a tossup. North-
western will probably enter Bill
_Breece in the 157 pound class
while the Panther entrant is still
a matter of conjecture.

Augie Arrigone has drawn
the nod in the ﬁrst three match-
es this season, but he is closely
pressed by Paul Wilson and Tim
Gay. All the matches between
these three have been very
close this year and any one of
the three could end up as the
top man at 157 pounds without
causing any surprise.

Coach Kraft praised his heavy-
weight corps before a broken hand
put defending Big Ten Heavy-
weight Champion Rory Weber on
the injury list.

In his place, facing Panther
heavyweight Tom J effries, will be
either Al Jaklich, defending Big
Ten 191 pound title holder or Bud
Melvin, a 220 pounder who was
the most valuable player on the
Wildcat football team this past
season.

The Pitt squash team will host
the Red and Blue of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania in the Field
House this Saturday at '2 p.m.

Penn’s losing record of 4-7 last

However, the Quakers appear
a stronger team this season with
the return of six lettermen.
Among these are ex-captains
John Kent, who posted a 5-6 re-
cord last year, third best for the
team, and Bill Reynolds, who top-
ped the squad with a 7-4 record
for the 1960-61 season.

The Panthers will be seeking to
make their season record 3-1.
Coach Bill Summers will use the
