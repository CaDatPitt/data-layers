_ The sale of -buttons, the proceeds
A from '-which will ﬁnance the Pitt
J Week program, -will be held. on the
' A" campus the week ‘of March 19.
._,f  The price of $1.00 a button, as was
A J  previously announced, will be charged,’
 ' [so that everyone may be able to en-
joy the week of celebration without
 ,_*a "great ﬁnancial burden. These but-
tons will admit the bearer to all of
_ the functionsheld during the celebra-
’ ftion. ’ This includes the lawn fete at
  Oak ‘Manor, :the‘ interfraternity migra-
' ‘tory dance, a big dance at Duquesne
 _~Garden and all other events as sched-
 'T' uled on the program. i
 Y ’ The_ committee has also _ decided
" j. -that those. persons who do not present
 .. gya. Pitt Week button at the door for ad-
. mission to the Duquesne Garden will
be required to pay $1.50 admission fee
~A ._«per person. This means that it will
 -be much cheaper to purchase a but-
 ton during the coming ﬁnancial drive.
‘i - ‘in case that a student, faculty or
alumni member wishes to take some-
 one not "connected with the Univer-
sity‘ to this dance it would be well
._ _-.'for him to purchase two buttons dur-
. A-. ing this campaign. A
' r t ‘The reason forthis step on the
*2. part ‘of the committee is because the
‘ affair will be run on just what is re-
. ' ‘-ceived during this campaign. The ob-
,ject _of Pitt Week is not to make

-_ '-permit. Therefore, the committee
‘ _xwants every dollar paid in advance,
n ..thus.ena‘bling them to plan for a big-
‘ .; f ger and "better Pitt Week..

, ._.Elizabeth Askin, chairman of the

The Senior Class Memorial Commit-
tee, decided that‘-a referendum ‘ballot

the will of the class‘ toward the pres-
entation of some sort of gift to the
University. The committee is as fol-
lows: Willis Mellot, Dorothy Stew-
art, Eleanor We'bster, Rober
and Robert Vvilson.

The committee feels that the gen-
eral sentiment of the class is directed
-toward having a fnemorial of some
sort, and ‘this ideahas been crystal-
ized «in some cases into -certain'deﬁn-
ite suggestions, _a bronze panther to
be placed in a conspicuous place on
the campus, a large clock, having pre-
sumably four faces and stationed
where the majority can make use of
it, a war memorial in the form -of a"
bronze plaque, etc. The committee
feels, however, thatthe ﬁn-ancingof
the proposition rather. than the chaos’-
ing of the gift will be the difficult
phase of the 'plan.. In order to obtain
.a true expression of the opinion of
the class as a whole on ‘the matter,
a ballot will be taken and the action
of the committee will be dependent.
upon the result. ‘ ' . "
V 'Since a memorial of any type will
-necessitate the expenditure of a con-
siderablefsum, and since the class
totals but little over 550students a
minimum pled_ge_ of $2.00 has been
set as the assessment. In ﬁlling ‘out
the ballot indicate whether you ap-
prove of having a memorial, whether
you are willing to let the matter of
choice remain with the committee, or
whether you have any deﬁnite sugges-
tion and what it is. Since the dona-
tion of_ this gift has been ‘planned for
Pitt Week, action in this matter must
be swift and decisive.

Ballot boxes will be placed in the
different schools today and tomorrow.
Ballot appears on an inside page of
today’s Weekly.

WINNER «TO   GET  
SILVER cur  

That the ‘silver cup will be offered
as a prize to the winner of the annual
chess tournament, the ﬁrstround of
which will begin next Week, wasthe
announcement, made 'by Phi Mu Sig-
ma, honorary chess fraternity, follow-
ing a meeting held last Tuesday. The
donation of the cup by Phi‘ Mu Sigma
is the first move of the fraternity ‘in
their recently adopted plan of placing
chess__ on a plane which will make it
among the most important of the non’-
athletic ‘activities on the . campus.
Among the activities which. the frater-
nity intends to sponsor this year are
the ‘annual tournament, the’ inter-

popularity
have become a regular institution, the
selection of "a team to-represent Pitt
in inter-collegiate comtpetition‘, they ar-
ranging of a schedule, -andthe playing
of other colleges and clubs. ’  -
Although chess has assumed’ .a
commanding position among the non-
athletic activities on the campus dur-

body as a who1e;knows' very little of
the history of the game, either here
or at other institutions.‘ In this con-
nection it would perhaps ‘be. Well to
give aishort history of the game, not’
only in connection with-Pi',tt,but in
its relation tothe collegiate world in"
general. ,  . I . 
Chess is the oldest competitive
game known to cdllege or university
students._ The origin of the game it-
self is_ lost in. the mists _of~anti'quity.
The use of it.as a competitive sport
between students of educational or
cultural institutions ‘dates back to the
dawn ‘of history._ All of the great
civilizations knew it. ,Thefscl_1ools of
Babylonia, of the old. Persian empires,‘
of the Phoenecian" empire, of _Ninevah,_
of Greece,“ Rome, .Italy, Spain, France,

An article published in the Febru-
ary 21 issuelregarding Dr. J. Ban-
bury, Dent. '08, and ‘his activities in
football and track 15 or more years
ago ‘brought several letters to the
Alumni Oﬁice of a rem’iniscent.vein.~
One of them from an early ’90 man‘
reads ‘ in» _part as . follows: L

“Glad to see the boost for ““Little
Banbury in _the last .issue of “The
It was certainly a deserv-
ing one. I remember ‘Little Ban’_very
well, in .the days “when Pitt needed

just such stars to put her on the map. ,

I think we should never forget the
work" of these men who struggled
‘away-under very adverse conditions,
in comparison to what the boys have
today. . i '

‘Banbury was a student in the Dental
School located away on the other side
of Pittsburgh, and it was a. hard job
to jump back from the -track house
on tlle'North Side to the Dental School
at Pride and -Bluff and Exposition
Park, where the games _were ‘played
and practices held. I cannot help- con-
trasting also the conditions of prac-
ticing "which existed then ‘-and now.
The new practice ﬁeld on the hill is
a _wonder to , what the
those days.~ , . .

We did not have a fodtball camp
either, although - -we did on several
occasions go to Exposition Park, Con-
neaut Lake, and try to get some early
work in there. There were so many
side attractions at thatplace that. this
was soon found not feasible, so_ we
did -our practicing either up on the
hill at the old W. U. P. campus, for

at old Expo‘Park.- I remember one

year when we practiced up on the hill.
The ground was so hard it was worth
your life to play there. Notwith-
standing this, ‘Little Ban’ and other
athletes of those‘ days gave Pitt :a
real reputation, and’, when they come
back as our guests," we should give
them all_a rousing cheer. r  e ‘

=“‘I might also_ ‘contrast the condi-
tions of 25 or 30 years ago, which
was around my time, when the con-
ditions for developing athletic teams,
were ‘even worse. Players inthose

days bought their. own suits and were‘

lucky to get a shower after the ‘prac-
tice. ‘In fact a shower bath was .a
luxury. i We had -no place to play or
practice, as a{ rule,’ and we had to
jump around from one- place to the
other making temporary , arrange-
ments as the seasonadvanced.’ Those.

men were the pioneers of athletics at

Pitt. ' -

“I always like to read articles 'in\

“The-Weekly?’ regarding the old days,
whether itrelates to football or to the
.University. Let’s have a lot of them,
lest" we forget.” A . _- - ' »

Pittites who. saw the" moving‘ pic-

at some of the local movie houses last
week did not -possibly know that some
of the scenes were taken’: in orange
groves owned by a well‘ known Pitt

‘alumnus, namely Earl W. Paul, Eng.‘

’01, Regis Toomey, Col. ’21, dropped
in the Alumni Ofﬁce‘ last week and
gave the editor some interesting data
concerning this. , . 4' .

Toomey was in‘California last year,
his family having moved to Upland,
a town about 30 miles om Los An-
geles. There he met Mr‘. aul, who is
very prominent -in” that ‘section, being
president of the Commercial Bank
and a leader in the development of the
orange industry there. Toomey said
that one day he was passing some of
Mr. ,Paul’s orange. groves andnoticed
moving picture men Working." A
closer inspection developed it was
Charles Ray, the movie stall, and the
picture"he was taking was to b
knownas “Smudge.” ‘
.“Sl_nudging,-"’ by the way,xis a sys-
tem ‘of increasing the temperature in
the orange grove when the thermome-
ter gets down to -about freezing point.
This is accomplished by lightingupots
containing. crude oil, these pots being
placed between the trees. It causes
a lot of smoke and dirt and there has
been 'a‘ controversy for some years
as to thedesirability of such ‘a proce-
dure. J

Democracy is endangered. it Why?

Dr. Samuel B. ‘McCormick answered
this question ‘in his address before the
Pumas Club last Thursday. He said
in part:‘ ’ . —
‘ A“Too few show Adeep concern over
the problems of the community, the
nation, and the world. Too few have
the ability to think in such Aterms.-

“Even more important than the
technical preparation for particular
professions, is the training "of the
mindfor leadership in the community
andthe nation. * A* * that democ--
racy may endure. ‘

“Do not be fundamentalists who do

A not depart‘ from the past, nor yet, ‘re-‘

actionaries who entirely disregard the
past. Train your minds to’interpret
the present and foresee the future in
the light of the past.” I

‘ In regard to the question, ‘.‘Can de-
mocracy long endure?” ‘Dr. McCor-
mick - further discussed, present day
problems, both Athose that concern us
only as a sovereign state,-‘and those

_that are of import to us as a member

of’ the national brotherhood. - ' “

HE Vice—President of a great life insurance
company who ‘began his career as an agent
has this to say to seniors who are about. to
graduate from college: ’ '

“If you love work and desire to pursue an honorable,
useful and lucrative mission in life this ‘is the business ‘
for you to take up. Life insurance salesmanship offers
a ﬁne ﬁeld for the energies of the splendid young men
in our colleges.

“That this is true is demonstrated by those college men
who have taken up life insurance for they have shown
that the college‘ man is fit for this kind of a job and
that the job also is-ﬁt for the college man.

“The work of the life insurance salesman is distinguished
by independence and oppottunityfor directing his own.
It gives all possible opportunity for individual initiative
and-a chance to make an‘ ample income at an age when A
most fellows are struggling ‘on a wage pittance.”

That is the story of one who began at the bottom and
reached the top without the help of a college educa-
,,tion. -The advantages are with you who graduate
from college. Before deciding your career make in-
quiries of the “Agency Department.” A G -S‘-I

CHESS FRATERNITY

‘ P -WILL GIVE’ CUP

(Continued From Page One.)

England and Germany all know the
game and held it in high esteem as ‘a
means of mind training as well as for
its value as a social asset and a
means of mental combat.

Today chess stands high in the
world of internationally organized col-
legiate activities. No» other game has
so truly an international aspect, no
other game is played by the students
of every educational institution of the
earth as chess is. Chess is the one
game in which there is international
competition, there being regularly or-
ganized international tournaments in
which teams from the various coun-
tries compete for honors.

The national aspect of chess in the
United States is very broad. With
the possible exception of tennis it is
beyond doubt the best organized col-
legiate activity or sport in the coun-
try. There has been for years a na-
tional collegiate championship tourna-
ment to which all of the important
colleges and universities of the coun-
try send teams each year. Pitt ex-
pects that within the next two years,
when chess has been placed upon a
ﬁrm ﬁnancial basis here, to be repre-
sented at the annual tournament
which is held at New York.

The history of the ‘University of
Pittsburgh Chess Club is one of un-
usual growth and inspiring success.
During the school year of 1918-19
seven members of the School of
Chemistry who had a liking for’the
game formed a little club. They had,
however, no deﬁnite organization and
neither held meetings nor elected of-
ficers. The following year the club
grew in membership until it contained
17 members. With the beginning of
the ﬁrst semester of the 1920-21 sea-
son, and the entrance of the class of
'24 there appeared a wealth of prom-
ising material. This was all that the
older members needed. They called
a meeting, organized 3. Chess Club,
secured Dr. Lane as faculty advisor,
and petitioned the University for rec-
ognition. This was granted imme-
diately, and the club, after holding a
tournament to decide the personnal of
the team entered into competition
with various other teams. The ofﬁcial.
recprds of the club show the follow-
1. That the club had an ac-
tive membership of 40;~2. that they
held two tournaments, one to deter-
mine the members of the team, who
were as follows: Cyrus G. Dunkle
(captain, and University champion),
Norman J. Harrar, Herbert Krow and

i Edward Smyers, and the second an

inter-class tournament which was won
by the Freshmen (the class of ’24);
that they gave three smokers at
which various chess celebrities, mem-
bers of the faculty, and students were
entertained; that ‘they engaged in
three intercollegiate matches of which
they won two and lost one, being
defeated‘ by Carnegie Tech, and win-
ning from Allegheny College and Ge-
neva. The oﬁicers of the club were:
Albert E. Hoyt, president; Leon N.
Loeb, vice president, and Norman J.
Harrar, secretary-treasurer. A

The second year of the club’s exist-
ence we ﬁnd the following statistics:
The oﬂicers were: A. E. Hoyt, presi-
dent; E. M. Sarraf, vice president; N.
J. Harrar, secretary-treaurer, and Dr.
Lane faculty advisor. The club had
a membership of 53, and 66 participat-
ed actively in the annual tournament.
The team was as follows: Norman J.
Harrar, captain and University cham-
pion; C. G. Dunkle, William Reiner
and Edward M. Sarraf. In the inter-
class tournament the Seniors were
the winners. Five smokers were
They
were well attended and showed that
there was a social side as well as a
competitive one to the Chess Club.‘
The team engaged in six matches,
winning four and losing two, the sta-
tistics being as follows: Pitt won
from Allegheny College, Geneva Col-
lege, the University of Buffalo and the
Westinghouse Chess Club; Pitt lost to
the Pittsburgh Chess Club and to Car-
negie Tech. . '

Phi Mu Sigma, honorary chess fra-
ternity, is an outgrowth of -the Chess
Club. It has taken over the manage-
ment of all of the activities_ of the
defunct organization, and will gradu-
ally enlarge them until chess assumes
its rightful position on the campus.
The tournament this year will be con-
ducted under the auspices of the fra-
ternity, as will also be the inter—class
tournament; The fraternity is donat-
inga silver cup, which will become
the permanent property‘ of the win-
ner. The cup will be suitably en-

   

graved, and will be on exhibition this
week at the “Y"‘hut. The‘ tournament
is open to any regularly enrolled stu-
dent of the University. An entrance
fee will be charged. This fee will be
ﬁfty cents, twenty-ﬁve of which will
be returned to the student at the con-
clusion of the tournament provided
that he has broken none of the tour-
nament rules. These latter include
the conditions that the student must
have played his matches off by the
time that the time-limit expires. As
ample time is always given this will
be easily fulﬁlled. This money will
be used toward the purchase of the
trophy. If any is left over it will ‘be
used toward ﬁnancing the big‘ smoker
that will be “thrown” at the conclu-
sion of the tournament.

An especial invitation is extended
to the members of the Freshman class
to enter the tournament. The advant-

ages of doing this aremany and man-

ifest. The most importantfact which
the fraternity desires to impress upon
the Freshmen, as well as the upper-
classmen, is the fact that they" need
have no especial knowledge, or unus-
ual ability at the game in order to
enter the tournament. It is true that
they may not win‘-a place on the team
this year but they should remember
that there are other years to come
and that there are other beneﬁts to
be gained. The men who are this
year’s Freshmen are the nucleus of
our future teams, and two or three
years from now, if they have perse-
vered in their desire for knowledge
of the game they will be the ones
who will get the trips, and will be ac-
tive members of Phi Mu Sigma. On
the other hand a place on the team
will assure them of the trips, and pos-
sibly in a year or so the acquisition
of the University championship with
all of the resultant honors. Further-
more there is a social side to the
smokers and all of the varied. chess
activities which is well. worth .obtain-
ing. ~All that is needed is a display of
interest. It is also very probable that
if enough interest is shown a Fresh-
man team will be organized which
will play-other teams of equal ability.

All applications for entrance to the
tournament must be handed in at the
“Y” desk, or to M. D. Straney, the
secretary of the “Y” hut. No applica-
tions will be considered which are not
accompanied by the entrance fee of
ﬁfty cents. All applications must be
in by Friday night, March ninth.

West‘ ‘Virginia then took the lead
and held it until ’three-quarters of
the .ﬁrst half had been played. .At
this point _Pitt staged a rally and
was soon leading by the-narroW"mar-
gin of one‘ point.’ The"Snake's then
opened. their second -attack, and at
theiend of the ﬁrst half led 23‘to 15.
.-Withjthe start of the secondhalf,
the Panthers showed their
wares and cut the..MountAaneers’ lead
to two points- -Then I-Iawley, Hill

By easily defeating ‘the West Vii‘-.

urday night, the Pitt Freshmen com-
pleted a su.-ccessful ' ‘ﬂoor s-eason.-.
Eighteen games were? played in. thir-
Cubs, and victories. resulted--in. thir-
teen of these contests. Braddock was
the ﬁrst aggregation‘ to trip up Coach
'McMAa.ster’s team. Other. teams who
‘were victorious over the, Freshmen
were the" Penn" State Freshmen, who
defeated them at State College; A Kis-
ki, who scored two» well earned vic-a
tories, one at Motor Squareand the
other at Salts~bur.g. Another defeat
was suffered last Friday‘ night.- at
the _hands_ of. A’Uniontown High at

Uniontown. ‘ .
A ~CAo.mpar’ed with their victories over
such‘ teams as the ‘Penn. Sta‘te;FreAsh-
‘men, and West Virginia-Cubs twice,
Bellefonte AAAcade’my,' and many other
good. prep ‘school A and high school
teams, ‘ the ’Freshment deserve much
credit for Vtheir fine work. Coach
McMa.stersA"deserves"a great deal of
‘credit for the showing of the Year-
lings, for it ‘takes time and consid-A
erable knowledge of the "cage game
to mould .a winning? Freshman __teani.
PI‘{LCtl'cal1y all the members are from

teams and this represented ‘ many
diﬁerent coaching systems. However,
Coach McMasters set, himself reso-A
lu_tely to the task of developing good
teamtwork and his system. of play,
with the result . that the Freshmen
had ‘the usual good Frosh aggrega-
cha.racte.rizes' all Pitt
teams. ‘  .  ’

In_ view of the fact that the var-
-sity loses." such men as CaptainAlBy-
.ers__,- Rose and "Jordan, --‘Panther fol-
lowers are likely" to -look with dis-
may upon the passing of these stars.

With the initial Apractices of the
candidates fo-r batteries already ‘ be-
gun, and) the remaining!“ candid-ates‘
due . to begin their A training. this
Week, baseball will‘ soon be here
in full force. In View of the large
number of ﬁne prospects and the
probabilities of .much better weather
than Pitt enjoyed during her train-
ing. season last year," Pitt in all prob-
ability is in for .a. highly successful
season this spring. _

The men ‘will be welcomed upon
their ‘return by the pre‘sentation' by
the -UA,nive_rsity of new quarters and
of new playing grounds. The new
football practice ﬁeld on the hill is
rapidly being put into shape, and

‘will bevused as soon as completed.

This will be much more comfortable
for the playersas they will be closer
to theyshowers and dressing room
than they’ are at Trees Field.

Coach Harley hassent word from
‘hishome in Philadelphia that he will
be here April 1, and after that time
things will burn for the Panthers.
There should be a lot of spirited
competition this s-eason, for there
are a number of.very good men fin
school.

The only men about whom the
dopsiter mazyl speculate at the pres-
ent time are.-the i-battery “men. . Of
these AHill, Curry, Noble and Swe-
tonic compose the foremost pitchers,
and Gables is the logical candidate
for the receiving position. All of
the battery men look good 'andAon
present form, shouldbe able to hold
up their -end. of the-game nobly.

The Fresh baseball materialis be-
ing sized up by Coach Bill-"Barrett.
From present appearances there will
bevplenty of material, but how this
material.will shape ‘up is Asomething
which only ‘-the "future can decide,

At present the only ouAtstanding.can-A

didate is Al Schmidt,‘ the former Al-A
Schmidt
was a teammate of Swetonids at
Alleghany, and comes here‘ with a
‘great’ reputation. _ K

Quite a number of contest
ing games with Slippery Rock Nor-

4

'mal -at. Slippery »Rock, with —Kiski

both here and at Isaaltsburg,-‘and with
Be1_lefonteA'Academsy", both here and
at. Bellefonte, are planned by Assist-
ant Manager Harry M. -Reed.

The basketball team traveled ‘to.
Little Washington last Wednesday
evening to meet its rival, the1_Wash-

-turn game.’ Pitt. won 29 to 27, -but
only "after one of the hardest‘ battles
a. Pitt team ever ‘participated’ in.. “
The .victory required an extra
‘period, as the score -at the end of
regulation time was 27 all. In the
extra ﬁve lm_inutes,[Rose,__ who was-
responsible for. six of Pitt’s ﬁeld
goals, caged a, goal. when three min-

ed. No other scoring took place dur-
ing this period-, with the result that
Pitt was able -to emerge victorious
for the third time this school year
from athletic contests‘ with W. Kr. J.

Winning this game, it seemed during
the -ﬁrvst half thatthe Panthers’were
going. to have an easy time. With
"the contest several minutes old, VV.

-‘half was behind 17' to 39.» ~ I
‘ -In the second half, Pitt held he
own until ﬁve minutes remained‘ for
the contest * to end.
this time was 27 to 19 in Pitt’s favor
and. there was no doubt in the minds
of any that Pitt would be the pos-
sessor. of a comf'ort.abl~e lead -when
the game would terminate.‘ But the
home team staged a rally which net-
ted Atexactly nine points while the
-Panthers were unable to score a
single point.
tied by a foul goal, the game: proper
ended-. ~ I ‘

In the extra period W. & J. was
in possession of the -ball most of the
time, but the shooting 'of.the, Red
and Black perforniers in. this extra
session was very inaccurate with the
conhequence that not a \V. & J.

utes. -Rose, however, nag managed
to register ‘a. ﬁeld .goal, ‘which ac-
counted for Pitt’s. two point advant-
