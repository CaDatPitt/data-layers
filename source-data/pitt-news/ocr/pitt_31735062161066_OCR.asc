Reverend poses ‘solution’ for homosexual communities

ByChan' taIEvans'

 Staff Writer _

Homosexuals need help, according to
Rev. John Harvey, founder of Courage, a
discussion group for those who no longer
want to be homosexual. S

“No one knows why people are
homosexual,” said Harvey, who spoke
Wednesday night at Synod Hall in North
Oakland as part of the Catholic Forum of
Pittsburgh’s annual lecture series. (‘We
should take advantage of the knowledge
we do have to help others who want
help.”

He said that there is no proof that
people are born as homosexuals;

however, he said, there is some evidence I

that childhood experiences play a role in
establishing an individual’s sexuality.

To prevent homosexuality in males,
Harvey said that a young boy should be
“encouraged to play with other boys his
own age and ltol rough it out” from the

-vu-~v‘

He said that homosexuals need other
counseling methods besides the one‘-to-
one approach. According‘ to Harvey,
group therapy is much more helpful.

This is why Harvey established the New
York City group Courage in 1980 . The

~ group is basically a support group similar

to Alcoholics Anonymous only for
homosexuals.

Harvey said that the same method
applied to combat alcoholism in A.A. is
being applied to combat homosexual
activity in Courage. '

The group offers five words, of advice to
homosexuals: .

1. Live by the teaching of the Catholic
Church. ' ‘

2. Share what is going on in your life
with others. .

3. Develop a prayer life.

4. Establish
relationships that are not homosexual in
nature. 4 V

that are not sexual in nature.
“They [homosexuals] need to share with

_ each other so no one will have to live the .

burden of the homosexual life alone, " said
Harvey.

“The Bible does not condemn

homosexuals but homosexual activity,”

he said. “Homosexuality is not regarded as
true physical unity.”

According to Harvey, many
homosexual men and women tend to be
compulsive about their sexual activity. It’s

‘ common knowledge“, he said, that most

homosexuals have morethan one partner,
a practice that among heterosexuals is
condemned by the Catholic Church.

Harvey encourages homosexual men to
form friendships with heterosexual
couples to “help get rid of some of the
[homosexual] baggage.”

Harvey said that women who are
homosexuals are far more difﬁcult to
reach with the “Word of God" than male
homosexuals because, he said, men are
more willing to admit thatthey need help.

 

“If homosexual activity brings
happiness, why is Greenwich Village so
dismal? I

“Homosexuals are out there, and they
need your help. That’s why I'm here,” said
Harvey.

Mark Smith, co-‘president of the Gay and '

Lesbian Alliance, in reaction to Harvey’s

, ‘speech said, “Why isn’t he working with

men that rape women? Why doesn’t he do
something with that? The psychological
problems are there. I’m not raping
women. If he wants to do something, why
doesn’t he do something with that?

“Everyone has had psychological, A

stressful situations at one time. If

psychological problems were the case,

everyone would be gay or lesbian.”
Smith feels that the whole concept of

homosexuality as sin isaancient and that

the church has a “preoccupation with

sex.” “What is their church?” Smith

asked. “Catholics are using birth control,

abortion and premarital sex all the time.

A subject that few think about
caught national attention this
spring as actress Meryl Streep
spoke out on television against
a chemical additive used to
enhance the appearance of
apples grown by American
farmers.

Streep’s efforts were part of a
massive media campaign

‘sponsored by the National
Resources Defense Council
which led to the Environmental
Protection Agency banning the
use of the cancer causing growth
additive, alar.

The media’s handling of
pesticide and food safety issues,
arch as the use of alar, was the

 

   I N  If 1>‘1>1' 

subject of a panel discussion held
at Western Psychiatric Institute
on Friday afternoon.

“As far as the press [covered
the alar issue], there was no way
for consumers to distinguish
between alar treated products
and non—alar—treated products,”
said panelist Larry Elworth,
program manager of the
Pennsylvania Apple Marketing
Board.

“The other problem, from the
[grower’sl standpoint, [is] the
difference between the imagery
and the substance of the issue,"
he said, pointing to examples
such as a 60 Minutes’ graphic
showing an apple with a skull
and crossbones -drawn/on it and
a ConsumerReporLs“ picture of an
apple held in a witch’s hand.

praised the media campaign. “I
commend the N.R.D.C. for an
excellent public relations
exercise,” said Tom Delsignore,
media relations manager with
International Chemical Industry
Americas Inc. "This was not some
abstract technical subject. We
weren’t talking about a chemical.
We were talking about what's on
the second shelf of the
supermarket,” he said.

Dr. a food
from Penn State
University, said that the early
press coverage of the issue was
“pathetic,” but gradually became

more carefully researched.

“Is that a real person?”
“Can I touch her?”

These were typical

The display featured a wooden

people killed in drug and
alcohol related deaths.
Christie Keiper, vice-
president of D.A.R.E., said
“People stop and look, but

D.A.R.E. sponsored the
display with the resident

National Collegiate Alcohol

also provided information and
statistics on drunk driving

“It's really a" much bigger

Two weeks ago, Pitt students
were encouraged by the “Sexism

conference to use their class
writing assignments to reﬂect the
values and attitudes of non-
Western, African American or

Audience members worried
that such attempts would be
misunderstood by instructors and
graded lower than those
assignments written to’ reflect
Western, European American or
male attitudes.

Nathan Urban, one of S.C.A.R.S.’s

Casualties of war...

By Jerome Lehmann
Staff Writer

U.S. Congressman Joseph
Gaydos (D-Pa) of McKeesport,
has introduced a resolution
supporting a program “to focus
public attention on recipients of
the nation’s highest military
decoration.” Simultaneously, the
Congressional Medal of Honor
Society has begun a project to
enshrine medal recipients in the
minds of Americans.

The MOH Society, a non-proﬁt
organization based in New York

(3 City, started a two—year project

on July 4 called the “Hometown
Medal of Honor Heroes” program.
The project’s purpose is to have
individuals research and discover
facts about medal recipients from
their area. » ‘"

Through localcooperation, the
society “wants to make Americans
more aware of the MOH recipients
and preserve their stories for the
future, ” said Gaydos. Information

...*‘—-,is being sought on all 3,393

recipients with additional
emphasis being put on 400 medal
awardees who have been “lost in
history.” S
Gaydos, dean of the
Pennsylvania Congressional

Delegation, introduced the
resolution [Hres. 203] on July 17.
The three-page resolution states
that citizens should “help preserve
a historical heritage of the United
States by providing the
Congressional Medal of Honor
Society with information on MOH
recipients who were previously
unknown or forgotten.”

Furthermore, the information
should be “distributed to
museums, libraries and the
National Archives, for use by
future generations.”

“The resolution gives
inspirational support for the
society’s program but holds more
weight than just symbolism, ” said
Gaydos’ aid Cindy Cavalluci. With
the help of Congress, individuals
researching cases can more
effectively “cut through the

bureaucracy” that they will
encounter.
Cavalluci added that the

resolution is “not an
appropriations bill” but does offer
the services of a Congressman.
The House Rules Committee is
expected to schedule the
resolution for a vote soon, said
Cavalluci, and “we have no reason
to expect it will not be passed."

society’s program was cited by
Gaydos. Wes Slusher, a resident
of McKeesport, became interested
in a local medal recipient named
Harry Fisher, who had been killed
in the Chinese Boxer Rebellion
of 1900.

“I woridered ‘why this hero
didn’t h2‘?v‘é3a plafjfue or any type
of memorial erected in
McKeesport,” said Slusher.
Angered at the apparent lack of

respect for McKeesport’s only war l

hero, Slusher
investigation.
He learned through military
records and local news articles of
the period that Fisher was an
alias for Franklin Phillips. Phillips
hadenlisted in the Army and
caught malaria in Cuba during
the Spanish—American War.
Dissatisfied with his medical care,

he went AWOL and returned to

McKeesport to recover.
After attempting to return to
duty Phillips was dishonorably

discharged as a deserter. He then
enlisted in the Man'neCorps under
the name Fisher and was
wounded in the Philippine
Insurrection. Phillips recovered
and was sent to China where he
died on July 19, 1900, the last
American killed in the Boxer
Rebellion.

The Marines issued Phillip’s
medal in the name of Fisher, but
he was buried under his proper
name of Phillips. After researching
for seven years with the help of
Congressman Gaydos’s office,
Slusher was able to restore honor

to the forgotten hero.

“Phillips now receives the
honor and respect due him  this

‘Hometown Heroes’

society’s
project,” said Gaydos.

The Allegheny County Veterans
Administration supports the
society’s program and has begun

to Assistant Director for veterans’

is in the process of trying to get

, Kramer said the first step to
establish a day of recognition for
recipients was taken onJu1y 27. It
was a ceremony where Leonard

This proclamation specifically

“Although the project is still in
the talking stages, we are hopeful
that the day of recognition will be
a reality soon, ” said Kramer.

which means dealing with students, who may at

Bush's solution to PACs helpful for Re

proposals are politically motivated
and are cleverly crafted to help
Republicans.

According to the New Yorle
Times, White House ofﬁcials have
admitted that the Republican
National‘ Committee worked
closely with the administration in
drafting the proposals.

The primary interest of the GOP
is not to reduce the inﬂuence of
PACs, but to break the long-
standing command of Congress
that the Democrats have had.
Republicans feel that they have

, an electoral mandate in Ronald

Reagan and George Bush, and
that this mandate should--be re-
ﬂected in congressional and
senatorial representation.
Democrats have derided the
proposal, calling it the “Fat Cat
Protection Act,” and are right to
feel threatened. But party politics
has masked the real need for
reform. Not all PACs have equal
access to ﬁnancial resources, and

‘because of this inequality, PACs

trusting its fate to a thousand
natural A shocks, many students
tough it out andstay‘ in the mat.

Some students study to pass
the time; others sing, and some
even talk to themselves. And then

there are the people who sit on .

the washer, propped up like some

_ bird of prey and stare intently at

their clothes spinning in the dryer,
as if their clothes could escape
once their owner turned around.

One sight that never fails to
transpire ’ in ~ the
Laundromat\singles’ club is the
guy pretending to be totally inept

at the art of laundry — and asking

the‘ curvaceous girl next to him
what “delicates and knits" mean.
Usually this character knows just
as much about the theory of

laundering as she does. Unfortu-

nately, the women realize this
too, thus, the ploy usua1ly,_doesn’t

-work — not that I would know

this from experience. .
Also comical is the sight of a

student arriving with a big bushel ,

According to the Wall Street jour-
nal, the National Security Politi-
cal Action Committee supported
Bush by ﬁnancing an $8.5 million

 

, campaign that included the infa-

mous Willie Hdrton television

Politicians have an obligation
to those groups who helped elect
him or her — and these obliga-
tions manifest themselves in pork-

barrel legislation. The B1 bomber I

“was built as a direct result of

heavy financial contributions from _
‘a multitude of defense contrac-

tors who reaped large profits
from their lobbying investments, ”
says former president Jimmy
Carter. .

President‘ Bush proposes to
eliminate PACs supported by

full ‘of clotheswho separates
whites from colors "— one by one
— into separate machines. I've
been washing my clothes for
almost four years now and my
methods are virtually failsafe. I

 

jam all my clothes into one
washer, pour in enough deter-
gent so tl1at I can no longer see

my clothes,’ play Russian roulette

with the dial in left corner and

trustmy luck. Except for‘ having

then-white socks and boxers that

are now blue, nothing disastrous

has happened.

I've also noticed the various
rituals inwhich people go through
when picking their clothes up
from the dryer. Most of the girls,
and some of the guys I've wit-
nessed, remove the articles piece-

corporations, trade associations

and unions. But ideological PACs 4

are guaranteed by the
Constitution, and what will pre-
vent business interests from reor-
ganizing under a different, ideo-
logical banner?’

To be fair, some of his propos-
als are laudable. For example, he
proposes full disclosure of all

” funds spent to inﬂuence elec-

tions and prohibition of the per-
sonal use of excess campaign
funds when legislators retire. He-
also proposes that the rules for
re-drawing legislative borders
after every census be set by law,
to eliminate the ‘natural advan-
tage that the party who holds the

majority in state legislatures has. .

Overall, the best solution is to
reduce politicians’ dependence
on PAC money for] campaign
funding, perhaps by introducing

’ public campaign ﬁnancing.

This is an idea that the Bush
administration has rejected, yet if

meal, fold them neatly and place

I them in color-coordinated laun- I

dry baskets. Oh, brother!-

One student, begging ano-
nymity, had a characterization
for these people. His six credits
of psychology snapping into
action, he said that these people
have an “obsessive- compulsive
behavior for neatness.” Strong
words, for a guy who stores his
unclean clothes in a suitcase and
takes the same calculus course
three times.

The one concept which I find

unfathomable is that some people
actually take their laundry home

with them, as if it were a room- '

mate. Don't these people realize
what fun they’re missing when
they have their clothes washed at

home? I guess I’m just jealous. I I

tried that stunt once my freshman
year and came back to school
with my parents’ clothes to wash.

Pseudo—intellectuals would
say that nothing can be learned

public ans

the administration wants to put

the political process “back in the .,

hands of the citizens of the 50
states,” then the measure of a
PAC’s inﬂuence should be the
number of votes that it can gar-
ner, not how much money it can
raise. Money is necessary to buy
coverage, but beyond a certain
threshold, money does not guar-
antee votes: ﬁve Republican in-

cumbents lost the 1986 senatorial 5

race, despite the fact that each

‘spent about twice as much as the

winner.

A fair solution would eliminate
the GOP’s inherent fund—raising
edge, and by setting spending
limits, eliminate the advantage
of incumbency by putting chal-

lengers on equal financial foot— »

ing, thus encouraging grass-root
voter participation. Perhaps if tax

I am writing in responseto J.

’ Billings’ October 9th perspective

titled “Don’t go greek, join the
scouts.” I would like to point out
that Revenge of the Nerds is not a
valid comparison of Greek life

‘ today, at least not at Pitt’s Pi

Kappa Phi fraternity. I am a pledge
there and my interpretation of
their lifestyle has been nothing
but positive.

First of all, my getting a bid had
nothing to do with my appear-
ance, nor my beer chugging
abilities. I don't even drinkalco-
hol. The brothers don’t care‘
whether or not I drink, they are
more concerned with me as . a
person and how I perform my
pledge responsibilities. They want

, to see that I am comfortable and

that I have a good time.
‘Second, investing money into
this fraternity is not going to be a
waste- It is more of an invest-
ment. From whatl have seen and
heard, I am going to receive

much more in‘ return than what I »

will put in. This investment is by
no means a way in which to
“buy” friends. I am still yet only a
pledge and I already feel as
though I have made many friends.

   
 

The brothers treat me with re-

spect and are always willing to
help me. For example, if I ever
need a ride somewhere, a brother
gives me a ride. If I need a place
to stay, the fraternity house doors
are always open. If I need help
with my studies, a brother is
always willing to help. Need I say
more? Just for the record — I was
once a “Scout” and believe me,
being a Scout has no legitimate
comparison to being involved in
a fraternity.

Thirdly, the Pi Kappa Phi fra-
ternityis much involved in com-
munity services. In fact, as a
pledge, one of my responsibili-

ties is to perform a community
servicevof my choice. Plus, need‘
I mention Pi Kappa Phi’s P.U.S.H.
project? It is a national fund raiser
which helps thousands of se-
verely. handicapped children
throughout the country. . So, .
obviously, a fraternity can be
concerned with the well being of
the community, as well.

Being a participant in a frater-
nity is [neither] a waste of time
nor a waste of money. It is a great
way to make close friends, ones
you can trust and look to for a
helping hand. People like those
are hard to come by. “Brother-
hood” is all that it is cracked up to
be. Being in a fraternity is the key
to having fun and success, in
college and throughout life.

Let’s not dwell on past

In response to a letter that ap-
peared recently in The Pitt News,
I was prompted to write the fol-
lowing: _ V _

It is undeniable that white

supremacist ideology is a promi- J

nent factor in the history of Euro-

~ pean peoples. In our own Unites
States, white racism has been the

primary source of the problems
that continue“to plague relations
between black and white Ameri-
cans today.

It is_the responsibility of those
of us in the white American
community to own up to our
racist heritage; we must never
forget our past, or deny the role
our racism has played in the

formation of our nation’s current -

state of affairs. Neither must the
black American community for-
get their history of sufferance.

However, we as a nation must
learn from our ‘past, not dwell
upon it. Now; more than ever, is

a time when black and white
Americans should strive to unite,
not divide. L - ‘

The growing militancy of such 4%

reactionary groups as the KKK

. and the neo-Nazis is a serious

problem, but we must recognize
that counter—reactionism as a
responsewill only deepen the rift
between the black and white
communities.

We must promote understand-
ing. We as Americans,'black and
white alike, must demonstrate to

L
our nation that there are those of

us who have risen above ﬁnger-
pointing and name-calling, -that
there are those of us who are

ready to unite as Americans and L

communities who would set us

Local hospitals offer to x-ray Hallotueen candy 

By Chris Studebaker

r-For The Pitt News

Because Halloween can be a
dangerous time as well as a fun
one, some local hospitals will
offer free candy screening on
Halloween night to ensure that
candy is safe to eat.

“The scariest part of Halloween

— should be the costumes the

youngsters are wearing, not what
might be in their treat bags,” said
‘Dr. Harvey Neiman, chairman of
the Department of Radiology at
West Penn Hospital.

The number of incidents where
candy has been tampered with
has declined every year because

_. of “a growing tendency in the

past several years to stay in one’s
neighborhood,” said Ralph
Proctor, a representative of the
Kingsley Association. Located in
Shadyside, the Kingsley
Association has held candy
screening since 1978, but since
more hospitals are using‘ X-rays,

they stopped this year.

“With the children staying in
the familiar neighborhoods, there
is less likely a chance that they
will receive some poisoned
candy,” said Proctor.

“Throw any candy away
immediately if it appears to be
tampered with,” Proctor added.

A Because homemade treats are

the most suspicious, Proctor
advised parents to discard them
immediately. ‘

Jane Hoover, a media relations
coordinator at West Penn
Hospital, said organizations that
offer free screening have helped
to decrease the A number of
tampered candy cases reported.

According to Hoover, there is a
great number of people coming
to these screenings because of
the fear of what may happen to
their children. i

. West Penn will offer free candy
screening from 7 to 9:30 p.m. on
Halloween night in the radiology

department at the hospital. They
will use their X-ray machine to
determine if the candy has any
metal in it.

Since the X-ray machine can
only detect metals, a Pittsburgh
Police officer will be on duty to
teach parents what to look for
when inspecting their children’s
candy.

With all the different kinds of
treats that children receive on
Halloween night, West Penn
Hospital and Proctor offer these
guidelines for children and
parents to follow when trick—or-

treating. ,

The children should:

—— travel in familiar
neighborhoods

’ — stay away from parked cars
— follow a prearranged route
-—— be accompanied by an adult

. —— limit activities to daylight
— stay away from strangers
-— not eat anything until an

adult has inspected it
The parents should:

are well fed, to deter munching

—— check all wrappers for signs

— be especially careful of fruit

— leave porch lights on as an

—— give baseball cards, coupons,

“We1l—publicized screenings

 
 

like ours should serve as a

,warning to the people who

tamper with Halloween candies
and fruits,” said Nieman.
Besides West Penn offering free
candy screening, parents are
advised to check with their local
police stations and hospitals to
see if they are holding similar
activities on Halloween night.

D.U.I.

Continued from page 1

24-year-olds, is- a nationwide
problem. Nearly 70 people die
due to drunk driving accidents
each day. Because of this,
1,416,816 potential years of life
are lost.

The 1.8 million drivers arrested

' for D.U.I. each year are causing

Pennsylvania legislators to crack

down on drunk driving laws. The

most recent laws, effected in 1983,
have streamlined the arrest and

_ conviction process.

For instance, if a police officer
has any ~ suspicion of drunk
driving, he can request the driver
to take a breath, blood or urine
test, and possibly all three. Refusal
to submit to testing will result in
a one-year license’ suspension
and can be used as evidence at a
trial for drunk driving.

A test showing a blood alcohol '
. level of .10 percent or greater

while driving is evidence of drunk
driving. For a typical 180-pound
male, this is five drinks.

A first—time conviction for drunk
driving requires a minimum 48-
hour jail term and a minimum
$300 ﬁne. These penalties could
be as high as two years in jail and
a $5,000 fine.

Mandatory minimum sentences
for repeat offenders are 30-day

jail terms for a second conviction, A

90 days for a third and one year

» for any subsequent convictions.

A conviction will. also
automatically suspend the driver’s
license for one year and require
attendance at an Alcohol Highway
Safety School at the driver’s
expense. A

The law does provide a one-

time alternative to trial, conviction
and jail sentencing. The

uneasiness during the situation
over the summer,” said Kuhn.
“Working with an area that is
often out of the control of society
bothers people,” he said.

For Kuhn, the discussion was
an opportunity for members of
the scientific, industrial and
agricultural communities to show
their concern for the unresolved
issue of chemical farm products.

One areaof great concern for
Kuhn and fellow panelist Dr.
Herbert Needleman, who served
with the N.R.D.C., is the lack of

I reliable data on safe levels of

pesticides used in agricultural
production.

Needleman urged that
consumers, farmers, scientists and
public interest groups join
together to make sure that
complete research is performed
and that resulting farm chemical
safety rules be followed.

in Eastern standings

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther swimming
team is coming off their seventh
straight Big East title, and under
the leadership of Dr. David
Belowich, this year’s squad has
the potential to further establish
Pitt as a national swimming
power. W

In order to have a successful
team, however, an abundance of

talented individuals is necessary, -

and as far as Coach Belowich is
concerned, the Lady Panthers are
overﬂowing with talent.
“lSeniors] Sandy Albright and
Laure Walczak are both great
swimmers and great leaders. I
look for strong years from both of
them,” said Belowich. “Theresa
Picklo is doing some things in
practice that she didn’t achieve

0’ until late last year. Julie Levri, a

walk-on, has been impressive.
Her desire to_ do better is getting

stronger and stronger. Karin Masal
has gotten stronger and has
improved her technique. And of
course there is Laura Lee
(Sullivan).” ‘

Last season Sullivan won the
1989 Big East Outstanding Female
Swimmer Award and also won
the Eastern Women's Swimming
League Championship in the 100
breaststroke with a school record
time of 1:04.58. In the Big East
meet Sullivan won the 200 and
the 100-yard breaststroke events
as well as the 200 individual
medley. Sullivan accomplished
all this as a freshman.

“Even though I was successful
last year, I don’t look at myself as
the leader of the squad,” said
Sullivan. “In fact, everybody on
the squad has certain qualities
that I look up to and admire."

Albright placed third in last
year’s Big East 100 backstroke

The Lady Panthers got off to a quick start Saturday night against
Penn State, but outstanding all-around play by the Lady Lions took
the match away from Pitt, 5-1. -

Penn State opened the match by running off five straight poin
behind the serving of Noelle Zientara. The Lady Panthers then went 0
on a 9-1 ﬂurry to take control of the game.

“Our middles were very involved in the attack. We were trying to
serve them very tough, and it was effective in the first game,” said Pitt
head coach Sue Woodstra. 0

Front line play by Michelle Adarnson and Lori Silk, along with quick

sets fromjanelle Lantagne, led the Lady Panthers to a first set win, 15-
9.

According to Rose, Bessie Rarnierez, an outside hitter for the Lady
Lions, was having the most difficulty with Pitt’s quickness. The
adjustments Penn State administered were mainly offensive. Tammy
Cairl and Michelle Jaworski led theLady Lions to a 15-5 victory in the
second game. ' 0 A . P - I

Brasco wore burden of bold team

Don't go calling me Tom
Smizik after this, but I feel this
particular topic needs to be
addressed. '

There is a great ﬂaw in the
way most human beings View
the importance of outcomes in
athletic competition —— it's taken
way too seriously, especially in
America. ,

Especially in football.

And this being Pittsburgh,
there has been and is a lot of
football going on come autumn.
High school, college, the pros,
Upper St. Clair vs. North Hills,
Pitt vs. Penn State, the Steelers
and the AFC Central. etc. Name
a bigger football town than this
one, and I along with another
500,000 folks will look you
straight in the eye and strongly
inform you that you are dead
wrong.

Pittsburgh, Pa. —— gridiron
capitol of the universe.

When teams and players
succeed here, they are lofted to
supernatural status; the Father,
the Son and the Steelers of the
’70s. The 1976 and 1980 Pitt

Panthers. Oh, what glory.

And there is nothing really
wrong with that sort of thing. It
gives folks at common bond,
especially in the hard economic
times that prevailed during those
days.

In general, people love their
bragging rights, and the Steelers
and the Panthers at that time sure

 

allowed us to be the biggest
braggarts in the country.

But the 1980s brought different _

‘fortune to the city. The Steelers
became mortal; 51-0_is proof of
that The Panthers won only three
games in 1984. For a while it
seemed like the skies were
crashing in _ on Western
Pennsylvania.

But when Pittsburghers lose,
someone has got to pay for it.
In the case of the Pitt Panthers,

Mark Brasco paid for it.

Now, before getting into
this heroic piece, I have to
admit that I took my potshots
at him in these pages, basically
in fun. Still, I’m no better than
the rest of the people that
heckled the ex-Panther
placekicker.

No, check that. I have one
saving attribute that suspends
me half a level above some of
the others: I i never did it
maliciously, to his face, within
earshot, with intent to
seriously make him feel

basically downright worthless. I

And believe me, that sort of
thing went on. It still does to
some degree.

What really hurt Brasco was
the fact that upon coming to
Pitt in 1984, his reputation
preceded him. He was
proclaimed to be “the best
schoolboy kicker in the
nation.” USA Today All-
American, Big 53 all-star, the
works.

“From the things that I’ve heard,
Penn State serves for consistency,

but tonight they had them both,”
Woodstra said.

The third game spelled disaster
for the Lady Panthers. They fell
behind 6-0, scored one point and
then lost the next nine points for
a ﬁnal score of .15~1.

“They did a lot of things we

Pitt was never able to get their
sixth point The Lady Lions’
serving took over as they went
on to win the ﬁnal nine points to
win, 15-5.

Pitt’s main problem in this
match was handling the Lady
Lions’ serve. Adamson said, “If
you can’t get a good pass [off the
serve], you can’t get a good set,
and then you can’t get the ball
over the net It’s just a domino
effect from there. And when you
get a string of them, it breaks the
team apart, and we become
individuals.”

missed ﬁeld goals he was
supposed to make; lost a few
close games for the Panthers
during his day. What happened
was that the pressure got to him,
and his leg cracked. Not the bone,

just its function.
And thus, he was literally hated
by most Pitt fans. Verbally

. ’scourged for being the villain he

was. After games, in public.
Around campus.

For what? For failing to kick a
football through the uprights of a
goal post. Ah, .a scoundrel indeed,
right down there with Benedict

Arnold and hey, why not, Adolf A

Hitler. Hang the S.O.B.

Rumor has it that several Pitt
players and coaches tried to run
the man off the team. Physically,
verbally.

And after he‘ was ﬁnally
replaced by Jeff Van Horne,
Brasco just disappeared into the
masses of students that attend
this university.

After most of this had already
passed by, I used to notice ol’
Brasco sometimes in the cafeteria,
sitting by himself eating, head

always down, like he was afraid
to look up in case someone might
recognize him.

Always by himself. Always.

Last winter, I had to find out
what the kid was like, what was
going on there. He was sitting
alone at a table near me and a
group of my friends.

“There’s Brasco,” one said.
Everyone already knew that.

“I heard he’s got a tryout with
Detroit,” said another.

"Yeah, that should take all of
two minutes," said the ﬁrst. We
all laughed.

l decided, on impulse I guess,
thatl was going to say something
to this infamous Brasco. I wasn’t
sure what, but that wasn’t
important at the time. He was
somewhat of a mystery to me at
that point. .

“What's up, man?” He had no
idea who I was.

He looked up, unsure. “How
ya’ doing?”

“I heard the Lions are interested
in you. How’s it looking?”

“Oh, not too bad. They’re ﬂying
me up for a tryout next week.”

He had this odd look on his

face, one of near disbelief, like
why was some stranger taking
interest in him. Why would
someone care about what
happened to Mark Brasco?

We small—ta1ked for a few more
minutes, yet the longer it went on
the more eager he seemed to
continue. Like he hadn’t seen
even a serni-friegndly face, in years.
Which he  3 .

Finally, my ‘I lfriends‘ informed
me they were leaving, so I wished
him luck and headed off with
them. He simply turned back to
his tray, head down, and
continued with his meal.

“Why did you do that?” another
buddy asked me.

“I don’t know.” I meant it.

 

iWant to hear some shocking
news, Pittsburgh? Brasco wasn’t
all that bad of 2 kid. Actually a
pretty nice guy, missed ﬁeld goals

Picklo, a junior, was third in both
the S00 and 1,650 freestyle. Masal,
a sophomore, was fifth in the 100

In addition to the swimmers
returning from last year's 9-1
squad, Pitt has added a nationally
ranked recruiting class, and this
will provide the Lady Panthers
with an abundance of depth.

All things considered, Albright
is ready for a big year from the
Lady Panthers. “The team’s goal
is to win the 0 Big East
Championships and the Eastern
Championships,” said Albright

Sullivan agreed, “I think we
will challenge for the Easterns.
We had a great recruiting class,
and that might give us an edge."

“Potentially, this is the best
squad we've ever had,” said
Belowich. “Even though we have
a very large team, we have a nice
blend, and they’ve been able to
focus on what we’ve asked them
to work on. I’m excited about the
upcoming year.”

Pitt opens their season on
Saturday at home against
Duquesne.
