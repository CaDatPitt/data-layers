Hangers

A g It seems that some of the gang around here didn’t quite
get hep to the jive, by this I mean the translation of the term
BLIPHER, (or BLIFFER as Mr. Wainwright (C.G.) prefers

,, spell it). Here is the literal deﬁnition: A two-pound one in
a one-pound sack; see also slacker, draft dodger, drip. How-
ever, we must go beyond that very formal language to ar-
rive at the mcrlern usage. You’re a BLIPHER if you “don’t

give a hang-er.”

Each Wednesday for three weeks the committee
will sell bonds throughout the entire day as it has
done in the past. Each day will feature a new meth-

contact all students in classrooms to impress upon

Instead of depending on these

bonds every day from 12:30 to 2:30 o'clock. Stu-

bonds any day in the week at the ground ﬂoor

Officers Training
Given to Newly
Elected Vt/omen

Training for the newly-elected
officers of "all women’s organiza-
tions on campus began last week
and continues through part of this
week. Treasurer’s training is at
3:30 o’clock_ today and training for
WSGA representatives will be at
3:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Both conferences are in the Syria-
Lebanon Room on the first ﬂoor,
Cathedral. '

“Leader’s Institute Training en-
ables these officers to serve in- the
different capacities to the best of
their ability because they start
their duties with conﬁdence in
themselves .and a knowledge of
what is to be done,” said Helen
Pool -Rush, dean of women.
Through their relationship at insti-
tute oﬁicers become well acquaint-
ed with each other and their duties.

Only through a realization of
the job that lies ahead of them,
knowledge of their duties, and
friendly cooperation among these
women leaders, -may the best
spirit of the University be re-
ﬂected. , M

“Through this training; comes a
unity, of all University women,”
said Miss Rush. “Today, more than
ever, this unity/ is so very neces-
sary because o-ur programs must
be adapted to new situations dur-
ing war time,” she concluded.’

been reduced from $3.00 to $2.75,
tax included.

The dance, beginning at 9 o’clock,
will be held in the Urban Room of
the William Penn Hotel and will

and are on sale to fraternity wom-

It will be a very different sort of

Easter Parade this year.

~ In the ﬁrst place, there won’t be
as many ﬂashy outﬁts because
women are buying for the duration
this year instead of for the day.

Because of rationing and clothes
shortage, the female sex is discov-
ering that they can no longer dress
in the usual Easter ﬁnery because
the hats are not as chic, they’ve
used their Number 17 ration stamp,
and there is not the selection of
suits, dresses, and coats of the

“good old days.

And the Easter Parade will look
strange because most women will
be walking it alone. i

So they don’t even care about
the clothes situation. “Who’s to

For Coming
Penn Relays

By CHUCK BAUER _

Moving into the last stretch
prior to their second important
competition, the Pitt tliinclads have
been working out in earnest for the
Penn Relays which will be held
l~‘i-iday and Saturday of this week.
Although held back by bad weath-
er, Coach Stickel has managed to
drill his boys in rather consistent
fashion during the last few weeks.

Pitt has "four teams running in
the Annual Relays, the sprint and
half.‘-mile relays, sprint medley and
shuttle hurdles. The sprint relay is
run at a distance of 440 yards with
four contestants. The
event is run in similar fashion over
a great distance. The medley is
run-at distances of 440, 220 and
880 yards with a quartet of run-
IIGTS. '

The Jungle Cats are fortunate,
in that three local trackmen were
asked to appear in the Invitation-
als. Tom Carr, sprint speedster
from ’Mt. Lebanon runs the 100-
yard dash; Harry Clark, all-state
high hurdles, and Paul Goodwin,
school, is entered‘ in the 120-yard
high hui'dles'and Paul Goodwin,
freshman hoopster, will throw the
javelin and-discus. ' ' .

Coach Stickel is out to match
foi-mer Panther Coach 0lsen’s rec-

ord on annexing four champion-2

ships in one year in the Penn Re-
lays. ’

 Q a./ieIIHere For Stadium Opener April 2

 

Pitt baseball will continue at long distance again this
weekend when the Panthers travel to Huntingdon for their

third game of the season. However, Bucknell will be here a-
week from Wednesday to help the Panthers ﬁnally open their

home season.

The home season consisted of all of four games orig-

enough to meet up with Jeﬁ" (Lefty)
Davis, Navy Ace who has held
opponents to all of nine hits in the
last three games he pitched.

The Panthers split with Buck.-
nell in the two games played last
year. They lost the ﬁrst one played
here at the Stadium but whipped
Bucknell on the second meeting.
Buc-knell is reported to have a
largely veteran team this year. Six
of the ﬁrst-stringers have had pre-
vious varsityv experience and Phil
Stamm, veteran right hander will
probably pitch against the Panth-

Reports are coming in about the
work done by the World Student
Service Fund which held a -drive
oncampus this year.

‘One of the most important pro-

‘gjects sponsored by WSSF was the

Student Home at Chambon in what
Was then unoccupied France. This
home provided a new and healthy
environment for many students who
had fled south when the Nazi
‘Armies swept into northern France.

When the students arrived at
camp they were in desperate
need of rehabilitation. Most of
them were undernourished and
were broken physically. However,
after a few months at the camp
under a trained stalf of qualiﬁed
doctors and nurses the improve-
ment in health and morale was
very noticeable.

At the beginning of August, gov-
ernmental authorities came to the
home to take a census of the stu-
.'dents living there. At the time
little was thought of this visit. N o
Zine suspected that the purpose of
the visit'was to prepare a list of
Uews for deportation to Germany
and the concentration camp.

A few days later the rumors

1 reached the camp that Vichy au-
thorities were raiding refugee
camps and seizing all Jews,
When the 18 Jewish students‘ at
the home heard this they were
sure that the police would arrest
them too. That night they ﬂed
to the woods surrounding the
house, lived there, and eluded the
police. They only returned to the

 Refugee Students Beneiited

house when it was absolutely
necessary to obtain provisions.
The police raided the home on
three successive days. They were
disappointed for they never
found any of the students. How-
ever, they conﬁscated the stu-
dents’ belongings, including their
food cards and identiﬁcation
papers. To be without a food
-card in France is to be without
food, and to be caught without
proper identiﬁcation papers is a
certain way to land in a concen-
tration camp.

Thanks to the splendid support
of the French people, these stu-
dents were able to make their way
into Switzerland. They were aided
by people who supplied them with
food and clothing at the risk of

getting into trouble with the po-
lice.

These students are now safe and
sound in neutral Switzerland and
are continuing,.their studies to pre-
pare themselves to ﬁll a useful
role in society after the war is
over. «-
