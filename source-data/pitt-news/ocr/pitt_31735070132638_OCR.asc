Festivalrig crowds  

MICHELLE SCOTT’
A Senior Staff Writer

When a Chinese poet drowned
himself 2,400 years ago in an act of
political protest, local peasants raced
in dragon boats to try to save him.
The occasion, minus the drowning,
developed into a tradition and sport
that spread around the world. '

Similarly, Pittsburgh’s annual
Dragon Boat Festival, which was ini-
tiated to commemorate Pittsburgh’s
ties to China, is growing into a cele-
bration of all of Pittsburgh’s___ethnic
groups and communities.

Dragon‘ boat racers, performers,
and spectators —— all from different
parts of the United States and the
world — convened last Saturday at

the second annual Pittsburgh Dragon .

Boat Festival at
Riverfront Park. .

Dancers, musicians, food and
craft vendors and members of
Chinese cultural organizations gath-
ered along the park’s cozy pathways,
while 40-foot boats outfitted with
wooden ‘Chinese dragon heads
charged beneath the Birmingham
Bridge and down the Monongahela
River.

“We always talk about our three
rivers, but we don’t have enough
activity. on our three rivers,” said
Linda Campbell, executive director
of the Greater Pittsburgh Sister
Cities Association.

Campbell explained that this
year’s festival organizers, which

include the Three Rivers Families.
with Children from China and the

Pittsburgh .Chinese.School, plan to
make the festival a yearly event
because of the enthusiasm for the
festival last year and the importance
of developing river recreation. ,

Pittsburgh held its first dragon
boat races at the Autumn Moon
Festival last September at the North
Shore Park, to _commemorate the
20th anniversary of Pittsburgh’s sis-
ter city tie to Wuhan, China.

Bush wants $87 billion in aid, Iraq home still a dump

Politicians ask questions about Bush aid
request 6
WASHINGTON —— Hit by sticker shock, law-
makers in Congress said Monday that, eventual-
ly, they will approve President Bush’s request
for $87 billion more for Iraq and the war on ter-
ror, but they want to know more about how the
money will be spent and efforts to share the
financial burden. .
“We’ll have to work on it as quickly as pos-
sible. I think it’s a bill that we have to pay,” said
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. ,
Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., who chairs the
House Appropriations Committee, cited the need
to protect “troops in harm’s way” and pledged to
“aggressively expedite” the budget request.
Even Sen. Tom Daschle, D—S.D., the Senate
minority leader, sounded a conciliatory note and
said he would work with the administration.
“The stakes for our troops and our national
security areitoo great for us to fail,” Daschle
said. “The president and Congress must now
work together to provide the resources needed to
both prevail in these troubled areas and to mee
pressing needs at home.” . ' .
But Democratic candidates for president
blasted Bush’s spending request as the result of
failed policies and miscalculations.
“A 15-minute speech does not make up for
15 months of misleading the American people on
why we should go to war against Iraq or 15
weeks of mismanaging the reconstruction effort
since we have been there,” said former Vermont

General Clark supporters gather in Oakland, aroundnation

ADAM FLEMING
p Staff Writer

Filling about half of Pamela’s
Restaurant in Oakland, supporters
of the grass roots “Draft Clark”
movement waited for a written
address, regarding the 2004 presi-
dential race to be posted on the
Internet —— from a man who has yet
to declare himself a candidate.

The address did not come.

The meeting, which lasted
Monday from approximately 7 p.m.
until 8:41 p.m., was part of an
ongoing effort to encourage
General Wesley Clark to run for
president. The volunteers in the
movement, which they have dubbed

Draft Clark, anticipated that Clark

would announce his candidacy
within the next couple of days, if
not on Monday. A
“When Clark announces [his
candidacy], there’s going to be a
dam burst,” Tim Feinstein, the
meeting’s key organizer, predicted
at the beginning of the evening.
Clark, who recently declared
himself a Democrat, had left even

his supporters inthe dark. He

offered very little information per-
taining to the nature and content of

' his address before its release.

The Web site in charge of
releasing the online address told‘ the
Pittsburgh chapter of volunteers
that they would have access to
Clark’s address at 8:04 p.m.

At the scheduled time, the
address had -not been posted. When
it did appear online, approximately
20 minutes later, it was unavailable
to the computer that had been set up
in Pamela’s Restaurant for the pur-
pose of receiving the address.

Organizers said they suspected
similar meetings across the nation
had overwhelmed the Web site host-
ing the address.

There were 150 Draft Clark
meetings scheduled to occur simul-
taneously, according to Feinstein.

During the past days of antici-
pation of Clark’s . announcement,
pundits have expressed doubts
about Clark’s chances because of
the lack of time left in the cam-
paign. . 0 ‘
But Clark’s supporters, as well
as Clark himself, have dismissed
such claims.

In an August interview with

Newsweek, Clark said, “I’ve got-

recon out there. I’ve got some
heavy artillery that can come in.
I’ve got good logistics, and I’ve got
strategic mobility.” e

Clark’s heavy artillery consists
of a volunteer base willing to com-
mit tota candidate that, as of right

now, does not exist, politically.

Clark is able to
draw a following
with his appeal to a
vast portion of the
electorate, his
impressive. resume
and, perhaps most
importantly, his abil-
ity to beat President

George W. Bush,
according to
Feinstein.

Bush, as the
incumbent, has held
an approval rating of

“The sensible
left will see

 

. Clark as their

A0 ally. ”

Tim F einstein
Key organizer of Monday is
“Draft Clark ” meeting

more than 50 percent for much of

his term in office.
“The sensible left
will see Clark as their
ally,” Feinstein said,
adding that Clark’s
military record could
help him draw in
Republican swing
voters.

Clark is a four-star
U.S. general who also
served as the NATO
Commander during
Operation Allied
Force in Kosovo. '

Feinstein continued by describ-
ing Clark. as someone “who can
very calmly present his ideas and
his agenda.” ,

Although the meeting at
Pamela’s Restaurant concluded
before the group ever obtained the
address, the gathering included a
lengthy question-and-answer peri-
od, when both those newly intro-
duced to Clark and his staunch sup-
porters shared ideas and informa-
tion

“When Clark’s [official] plat-
form comes out, he will be on the

tents". The settlement has about 30
families. .

Sa’ad lives with her three chil-
dren, her 75-year-old mother, her
brother and a male _cousin.

She is married, but she is a sec-
ond wife —— polygamy is common
among Marsh Arabs —— so her hus-
band comes only once a month.
Jobless, he isn’t much help.

The arithmetic of their survival
is simple. Each morning, they pick
aluminum cans and plastic bottles
out of the trash, put them in sacks
and sell them for about 12 cents a
bag.-The money buys food for them
and their animals, and pays trash-
truck drivers to dump loads. of
refuse. Each family has its own sec-
tor of the dump. '

If they don’t make enough from
the trash, sometimes they have to
sell a sheep. .

American Muslims \may get
Muslim-themed cable channel
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. —— Are
U.S. television audiences ready’ for
an American Muslim version of the
game show “Jeopardy?”

Or a Muslim sitcom?

How about a stand-up routine
about the Muslim experience after
Sept. 11, 2001?

Former Concord, Calif., resi-
dent Muzzammil “Mo” Hassan and
his supporters are betting on it:

They are trying to start the coun-

try’s first Muslim-themed cable
channel. ’

They have enlisted hundreds of
mosques around the country,
including many in the Bay Area, to
spread the word and help get

Bridges TV into living rooms by ,

next summer.

The idea came to Hassan’s wife,_
Assiya Hassan, in November 2001
as the couple were driving in their
current home state of New York,
listening to a commercial talk—radio
station, the Bridges" TV CEO said.

“She became upset that the host
and the callers were turning nega-
tive toward Muslims, and she felt
there was a need for American
Muslims, to create their own pro-
grams and show themselves both as
Americans and as Muslims,”
Hassan said.

“We want to help build bridges
of understanding between American
Muslims and non-Muslims.” ' ’

First, Hassan. and his backers
need to convince major cable and
satellite companies that their idea

has legs, which‘ means enrolling at g

least 10,000 paid subscribers before
a single program airs. The station
has signed up 2,500 subscribers so
far.

Hassan has recruited the finan-
cial and moral support of prominent
American Muslims, including box-
ing legend Muhammad Ali and bas-
ketball player Hakeem Olajuwon, to
help raise the $15 million needed to
start the channel.

As reflected on the Bridges TV
Web site, some American Muslims
wonder if such a cable channel

-would be censored for presenting

Muslim viewpoints at a time when

thousands of people of that faith are
being’ detained, questioned and
deported. 5

' Earlier this year, Comcast
refused to air advertisements during
President Bush’s State of the Union
speech that opposed a U.S.-led
attack on Iraq, a position that many
American Muslims espouse.

The channel will eschew vio-
lence, foul language and excess
exposure of flesh, in accordance
with Muslim values, said Aleem,
who is also organizing what she
said will be the nation’s first
Muslim Film Festival. ‘

It will take place in the Bay
Area in March. '

“That’s another reason why
Muslims don’t relate to what’s on
TV,” Aleem said. “We see moral
values degrading to Muslims.”

But how will a TV station speak
to everyone from Indonesians to
black Muslims to the curious mass-
es?

A “We will focus on things unique

to the American Muslim experi-.

ence,” Hassan said. “The melting of
ethnicities, free—speech issues, or

issues,” Feinstein told the audience
of less than thirty people.

Convinced that Clark’s personal
appeal "and track record could
sweep the traditionally Republican
regions of Pennsylvania, Feinstein
labeled Pennsylvania as a “critical
state” in the election.

Clark’s abilities as a candidate
could amount to nothing, however,
if he decides not to run.

The Monday night meeting

reflected a growing sentiment
among many of Clark’s supporters,
who wonder how much longer will
they have to wait.

As Clark’s address repeatedly
failed to load on the group’s com—
puter, Feinstein jokingly said, “This
is kind of what the last month has
felt like, isn’t it?”

But the significance ‘of Clark’s
impending announcement was not a
joking matter to some volunteers,
who aregrowing restless- and con-
cerned that Clark may return a neg-
ative answer.

of a space shuttle — when it hap-
pens —— will be a test run to try out
safety modifications that will be
added to the fleet in the coming

months, NASA officials said
Monday.
'The mission, as scheduled

before the Feb. 1 Columbia acci-
dent, was supposed to be another
step in the construction of the inter-
national space station.

But while shuttle Atlantis, with
astronaut Eileen Collins‘ at the
helm, will still dock with the orbit-
ing laboratory, managers are lean-
ing against theidea of using the
mission to take a new crew to the
station, shuttle—program manager
Bill Parsons said at a press briefing
in Houston. '

That’s because Collins and her

will be asked to perform a host of

additions to the orbiter.

The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, which
Monday publicly released its pre-
liminary plan for returning to ﬂight,
hopes to have everything from new
cameras to an in—orbit repair kit on
board by the time of the next
launch. _ «

William Readdy, NASA’s top
spaceflight official, said the agency
is working on implementing the

recommendations issued last month
by the Columbia Accident
Investigation Board, plus additional
changes of its own devising.

Readdy and Parsons stressed
that, while the return—to—ﬂight plan
is aimed at a launch window
between March 11 and April 16,
there is so much work to be done
that it’s impossible to set a concrete
date. A

“We’re going to be safety-dri-
ven, not schedule—driven,” Readdy
said.

An even thornier issue, Readdy
said, is taking the Columbia board’s
most amorphous recommendation

— that NASA needs a cultural and
organizational overhaul to replace

its “broken” safety culture — and
making it happen.
“There’s a challenge there.

There is very much a ‘can—do’ cul-
ture that we’d like to keep. There
was a culture that stifled communi-
cation that we somehow have to
eliminate,” he said.

“(But) we don’t want to throw
the baby out with the bath water.
We want to value the culture that
came back after Apollo and came
back after Challenger.”

File—sharing lawsuits target college students

The Recording Industry Association

pf America wants to know what goes on

in your house, at your computer.

Through your Internet service provider,

the RIAA wants to ﬁnd out what you’ve

been doing late at night, on—line, looking
at ﬁles you’re not supposed to.

Calm down, all you furries and
“Bejeweled” junkies.

But be worried if you have down-
loaded music ﬁles through KaZaA or a
similar peer—to—peer server.

On Monday, the RIAA ﬁled 261
lawsuits against people_ who down-
loaded music ﬁles, an act of what it sees
as copyright infringement. The RIAA
feels that music falls within its domain,
and the ﬁles are, therefore, the intellec-
tual property of both the industry and
the artists. ‘ ' a

Under copyright law,-violators can
be ﬁned $750 to $150,000 per ﬁle,
though the average lawsuit of the kind
settles at $3000 total, according to a
Sept. 9 article in The New York Times.

College students comprise the
largest group of downloaders, in part
because they have access to-high-speed
connections that pipeline resources,
porn and music to them. Resultantly,
they are in danger of being taken to
court for their illegal activities.

Loopholes, in’ these laws exist.
Based on Pitt’s policies, if students keep

- their shared-ﬁle folders empty, they’re
not in imminent danger. Similarly,

because this round of lawsuits already
identiﬁed its defendants, if there are no
subpoenas in your mailbox, you’re
probably good for now.

The question then remains: are
these lawsuits justiﬁable?

Taking music, criminally or other- ‘

wise, did not begin with the Internet.
After each technological advance - —
cassette tapes and VCRs — lawsuits
arose to challenge the new and freer, but
less regulated, ways of distributing
PF0Pe1’tY- . _

Furthermore, bootlegs of concerts
have circulatedifor years. As any Bob
Dylan or Grateful Dead fan will tell
you, some of the best tracks aren’t
released on albums -— they come from
fans taping their shows.

Bootleggers can be prosecuted, but
much like jaywalkers, they are usually
left alone. What most downloaders are
doing is a form of uber-jaywalking, par-
ticipating in a crime they see as victim-
less. . '

The RIAA claims that it is the vic-
tim, because as the number of down-
loads goes up, record sales decline. Still,
given that CDs cost around $18, many
say that they are driven to download
because of limitation of funds and selec-
tion. V

In essence, the RIAA is crirninaliz—
ing its potential customers, suing them
in order to destroy their — illegal —
competition.

Pitt buses, courtesy reasons to move to city

The Pitt shuttle bus driver cackled,
“Oh! The party house!” after being told
where a few new friends and I were head-
ed on one of my first nights in Oakland.
I’d never taken a shuttle before, and Iiwas
a little concerned that we were headed
somewhere we could be stranded. I ﬁg-
ured that now wasprobably the time to
stop being such a darrm loser, though, so
I hopped on the literal bandwagon.

It screeched to a halt right in front of
the house, even though it wasn’t a bus
stop, and the bus driver told us that she
would be running the route all night long.
She laughed that crazy hor- ' 
ror-movie caekle, told us to
have fun, and the bus sped
off into the night like some
obese and‘ unwieldy , phan- ,
tom_.\

The night _went as I
would have expected. People
threw up, came very close to
falling down steep stairs,
spoke gibberish and walked

about some of her own, and then she

mugged us.

Just kidding. My parents were wrong
— not everyone on our urban campus is a
derelict. I secretly threw away the WVU
application that -they handed me with
their alumni pride-, and applied here

instead. .

Their worst nightmare came true ten-

fold: not only would their precious and V
' only daughter not be attending their ver-

sion of heaven, but she would also be
going to school in a — oh no! —— city. I
escaped the death grip of suburbia and
fell into the open arms of
Oakland.

That shuttle bus was
just another form of the
Welcome Wagon, sans the
cutesyness of the actual ones
I’ve. encountered in the sub-
urbs — they’ll bring you bas-
kets of coupons, free sam-
ples, and reeking, homemade

around in various states of
undress. All in all, I had a great time - it
was all especially exciting to my tender
eyes. . . I

Eventually, we wanted to leave and
stumbled out to the porch, where some-
one told ‘us that the shuttle takes forever
and that we might as well walk. We began
down a side street \ —— holdinghands,
though I can’t remember whose hand I
was actually holding or why — towards
the distant Cathedral. ‘

About two blocks later, the dead
street was given shock therapy as a bus

lumbered towards us and squealed to a '

halt in the middle of the road, next to us.

“Hey! What you guys doin’ walkin’?
‘I told you I’d take care of you! Hop on!”
she cried, followed once again by that .
whooping chortle. ‘ I

We tried to show her our IDs, but she
said she remembered our faces. She
asked us about our night and cackled

everyone in your new home-
town’s life story and the scandals therein.
The, bus was way cooler —. it brought
adventure, excitement and unrecogniz-
able odors! ‘Eat that, Welcome Wagon
soccer moms! The bus driver dropped
each of us off at our respective dorms,
making sure each got to wherever we
wanted to be, even though it wasn’t on
her route. You can’t get much more hos-
pitable than that.

' I’ve had nothing but similar, uncom-
monly heartwarming experiences here,
and I hope’ to keep it that way. I didn’t
even think twice about hopping right on
that bus, despite the _shadiness of the dri-
ver, and I hope I never get to the point
where I live in enough fear that I do.

Liberal arts education: broaden minds by narrowing focus

Most serious students have no’ interest
in graduating college as one— or two-
dimensional people. We would rather be
diverse, complex, multi—faceted — the
type who drop‘ names at cocktail parties;
everyone’s favorite Trivial Pursuit partner.

In most cases, we look to the liberal
arts schools, ‘such as Pitt’s College of Arts
and Sciences, because we believe that ful-
ﬁlling requirements in different, academic
areas will fashion us into the well-rounded
individuals that we’ve admired. This is
both a noble and attainable goal.

But it could be more attainable, and
CAS could make it so by sticking to elec-
tives and canning requirements.

General Education is only as good as
the students who participate in it. Or per-
haps more accurately, it is only as good as
the students are motivated.

If every Film Studies major to come
through the system were eager enough to
learn that he put 110 percent into the Gen.
Ed. classes, as well as those within his
major, the liberal arts setup would work
perfectly. ‘

But, generally. speaking, once stu-
dents decidewhat they want to pursue,
they would rather devote their time and
energy to their major, without havingtto

' bother with other, less relevant topics.

For instance, Pitt’s School of
Engineering requires General’ Education
classes, but they vary, depending on which
type of engineering you want to study '—
chemical, civil, computer, etc.
Engineering students take Gen. Ed. class-
es that are directly relevant to their con-
centration. '

The same approach could very easily
be applied to CAS, so that students could
develop a deeper understanding of
jects related to their owninterest and’tal-
ent, gaining a deep appreciationfor their
area of expertise. '

Most majors CAS‘ offers are broad in

and of themselves, and are hard enough to
tackle without being watered down by
Gen. Eds‘.

A subject like anthropology, for
example, offers a world of study opportu-
nities, and anthropology students would
be better off devoting allof their class time
to their enormous subject, rather than
being required to take extraneous math or
literature courses. If they decide they need
to take these other courses as a break from
the norm, they should be given the option,

but not handed the requirement.

Two years ago, I was a gung-ho
sophomore lit major with two natural sci-
ence requirements to fulﬁll. I didn’t want
either of, them, since I already had a

lengthy, considerably more interesting list '

of Englishcourses to take, so I checked for
an easy way out. I foundmy escape in a
class called Astronomy 0087, “Basics of
Space Flight.” The course description list-
ed 0087 as “A new, self—contained 3 [cred-
it] course for students not majoring in the
physical sciences.”

The last part of that
description is very telling,
because it could just as easily
say, “for students seeking a
way to avoid studying the
physical sciences.” Space
Flight’s grading scale was
comprised of only two scores
——- midterm and ﬁnal ——-I no
attendance, and, best of all, a
grading scale that passed any-
one who ﬁnished above a 15

percent. After the ﬁrst day of ’
class, I felt half relieved, half frustrated.

highlight the weakness of lib-
eral arts. Please understand
that I am not bragging when I
say this — I skipped Basics
of Space Flight on a regular
basis, learned nothing of
value, earned an atrocious
percentage and walked away
with a grade that didn’t hurt
my QPA.

This class isn’t the only

weak course in the CAS cat-A

like it show that the administrators are

Classes like this one, designed for and already aware of my stance — it’s point-

pandering to kids who plan on skipping,

 

less to require a lit major to study astrono-

my, so you send a Get Out of Jail Free card
to accompany the requirement, which, in
turn, just makes it all more pointless. .

I don’t think the Gen. Ed. system in
CAS needs to be abolished, necessarily,
but it should be modiﬁed, and students
should be able to stick closer to what is

truly relevant to their educations. The-

result will be more focused, intensive,
well-rounded degrees, and I doubt we will
see a notable drop in cocktail party name-
dropping.

What not to remember about the.‘80s: Reagan and hair spray

I have observed a phenomenon
that is deeply disturbing —— not just
an “unsettling” kind of disturbing,
but more a “close up of Joan Rivers’
polymer—based face” kind of disturb-
ing. Some people — and I choke as I
write this because it is so heart-
wrenchingly awful — actually like
the ‘80s. We all know the horror that
was the ‘80s — the Reagan adminis-
tration, big hair, Whitesnake, “Weird
Al,” guys in brightly colored jackets
snorting coke and trying to figure
out those vexing puzzle cubes.

‘ What type of mass delusion

would compel people to think this‘

nightmarish decade was a
good thing? Man, I
freakin’ hate the ‘80s.

In a certain respect,
one cannot expect much
from the ‘—80s in the first
place. After all, its pre-
cursor was the late ‘70s,
and we _all know what an
awful era that was. I sup-
pose that after so many
years of disco and Cheech
& Chong movies, every-

one desperately needed change;
therefore, the ‘80s seemed like a people today need be so blind as-

just setting ourselves up
for eternal ridicule!”

. from the ‘80s had that
much sense, but that does not mean

good idea at the time. Unfortunately, well.

If you’re a girl and’ you catch

Classical conditioning, similar.
to that which Pavlov used on his

way to obliterate‘ this tendency to
have sympathy for the 1980s. Some
effective toolsto use against ‘80s
lovers include, but are not limited-
to, baseball bats, big clown ham-
mers and Pearl Jam. ' «

The ‘80s can, in a pinch, stand

as a metaphor for all that is wrong in
society. The events of the ‘80s
spawned the .‘90s, and the ‘90s have
led us directly to the mess We’re in
today. _

Getting Pitt. students out of their rooms since 1906

Late release worth the wait for Pittsburgh

The Shape of Things

Starring Paul Rudd, Rachel Weisz,
Gretchen Mol, Fredrick Weller
Written and directed by Neil LaBute

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A&E Editor

There are few things as heartbreaking as an
excellent film not getting a major release, outside
of cities like New York and Los Angeles. This fate
befell “The Shape of Things,” the latest film from
Neil LaBute and one of the best films of 2003.’

Originally set for .a Pittsburgh release last
spring, the film didn’t see the light of day here, or
many other places for that matter, because it didn’t
do well in those major cities ——.»what do they know
anyway? — and was shelved until its homevideo
release.

It's curious that “The Shape of Things” didn’t
take off in a place like New York. A film about
what it means to be beautiful and the -we-ight -that
beauty, or the shape of things, holds in our con-
sumer culture sounds like something‘ that an art-
house, hipster ﬁlm crowd in NYC would gobble
up. - , .
But maybe the criticism of that culture offend-
ed some and it certainly didn’t help that the “vil-
lain” -—— there is no real villain, in the tie-a-help-
less-girl-to— »

After meet-

ing Evelyn, the
balance Adam
enjoyed in his relationships with Phillip and Jenny

is disrupted. Throughhisirelationship with Evelyn,

Adam becomes less of a pushover and more self-
confiden-t and . begins " to change his outward
appearance —— he changes gradually from someone
who looks like a latter-day Harold Ramis to some-
one who is the spitting image of Ben Afﬂeck. But
as positive as these changes might be to some, for
Adam, they throw hisworld into turmoil, leading

actors in the film is

those around him.
“The Shape of Things” is a film that
wouldn’t play in a multiplex, as evidenced by
~ its lack of a major push from its studio to get
it out into theaters. Then again, most films
with excelling writing, direction and acting
fail to find their way to a mass audience, so
The chemistry between all four of the
actors in the film is undeniable. Rudd, Weisz,
M01 and Weller all participated in the stage
version-of “The Shape of Things,” and their
familiarity with one another allows them to
slip into their characters and have on-screen
relationships with one another that seem less
_ performance and more a few days in the life of
these four realistic people. '

Moreover, LaBute’s writing is sharp and

his direction excellent. Because he’s working

from his“ own source material, he, like the

actors, has a familiarity with the characters
and narrative that allows him to craft a nearly
ﬂawless ﬁlm. .

' E The ending of the film is its one weak point.
While a surprising and incendiary conclusion to a
scathing look at the cult of beauty and celebrity in
a consumer culture -—— one that shouldn’t be ruined
— it’s a little too realistic, and, as a result, uncom-
fortable. P

' There’s a point where a film can be too realis-
' ' tic, and this film

«said, though, it is. a
stunning conclusion
to ..an excellent film
— one of the best
of 2003 —— that
should not be

Rock out at The Warhol

The exhibit “Clown Paintings:
From the Collection of Diane
Keaton and Others” was deemed a

= joke that was just plain scary, and

the “Keith Edmier and Farrah
Fawcett” and “American
Supermarket” exhibits weren’t
exactly up to par with the
Andy ' Warhol
Museum’s reputa-

tion for eye-

catching pop art.

_ But Andy _,   

need not roll over
in his grave just yet.
Though the art exhibits haven’t
been getting the best reviews lately,
the Warhol’s Good Fridays are an
entirely different story. .

When they played their first
show on New Year’s Eve in 1991,
The Karl Hendricks Trio was just
that — a trio. Some changes in the
lineup occurred, changing the trio
into a quintet named The Karl
Hendricks Rock Band from 1998 to
2000. Today, they are back to their
original number.

KATE B‘EC.KmsAI..E

From 1992 to 1998, The Karl
Hendricks ‘Trio released six albums,
none getting less than four (out of
five) stars from the loyal readers of
Rolling Stone. The local band even
has a bio page on the magazine’s

’ Website. Who says Pittsburgh does-

n’t have a kick—ass local
music scene?

They’ve been

quiet since 1998,

but their latest

release on Merge

Records, 2003’s The

Jerks Win Again, is sure

to make alt—rock fans sit up and
take notice.

And notice you can, frugal
friends. To celebrate the release of
Jerks, The Karl Hendricks Trio will
be rocking out with Chicago—based
Silkworm at _ this week’s Good
Fridays event at the Andy Warhol
Museum.

Tickets will run you only $5 for
the event, which kicks off at 7 p.m.,
Friday, Sept. 12. ’

Another comic-book hero movie

American Splendor

Starring Paul Giamatti and Hope
Davis

Directed by Shari Springer Berman
and Robert Pulcini

‘t‘r*£r‘ﬁ1/2

“American Splendor” is one of many
comic books recently turned into ﬁlms. But it’s
not “Spider-Man” or “X-Men.” It’s closer to
“Ghost World.” '

Early on, there’s a disclaimer. The real
Haiyey Pekar, the man whose life the ﬁlm
depicts, warns that his story doesn’t offer
escapism and it’s not very amusing. But he’s
wrong. The ﬁlm is quite funny. ‘

Pekar just wishes his bio was a bum-
mer. Dropping in throughout the ﬁlm to
lend comment — a device one keeps
expecting to go wrong that never does -
the man himself refuses‘ to characterize
his life as anything but a drag or admit to
any degree of success.

I think we can call him an antihero.

After a brief intro to Harvey as a
child, trick-or-treating without a costume
alongside kids dressed as comic book
heroes like Batman and Superman, the
ﬁlm moves to dingy, permanently—over—
cast 1970s Cleveland, where he —— his
cinematic incarnation, played by Paul
Giamatti —- is just a regular" guy, a "loser
even. He works as a file clerk in a VA
hospital, lives in a ﬁlthy apartment and
obsessive—compulsively collects comic
books and jazz records. A nodule on his
vocal cords is destroying his voice and he
can’t keep a girlfriend.

' That’s it. That’s Harvey.

His maladjustment is about to give
birth to something, though -— apopular
underground comic book about his
everyday life and how grueling he finds it _
to be. After an incident at a grocery store
checkout leaves him particularly ﬁredup,
he spews the horriﬁc details of “standing
in line behind old Jewish ladies” onto a
page. An acquaintance of his, R. Crumb,
weirdo artist and subject of the excellent
1994' documentary “Crumb” + “they
made a movie about him, too,” says
Pekar in his narration — lends illustra-
tions and “American Splendor” is born.

The ﬁlm, "simultaneously a biopic
and adaptation of the comic, soon shifts
focus to Harvey’s awkward romance —
in which obsessive-compulsive disorder
meets hypochondria, among other things
-— with Joyce Brabner (Hope Davis), a
fan who hastily becomes his wife.

Giamatti, who’s been consistently
memorable in small roles like “The
Negotiator” and “Private Parts,” makes a
superb leading man, carrying the ﬁlm as
an unlikely hero. The actor dives head-
long into the character’s frump, going so

Crumb’s grotesque renderings of Pekar at
times. . »
The discovery here is Judah

nerd” Toby Radloff, coworker of Harvey’s and
brieﬂy an ‘80s MTV mascot. His spiel about
what “Revenge of the Nerds” means to him is
fall—down funny. I haven’t laughed so hard in
months.

But by far the most remarkable accom-
plishment of co—writer-directors Shari Springer
Berman and Robert Pulcini, documentary ﬁlm-
makers making an impressive feature debut, is
getting the real Harvey involved and using his
commentary in a way that actually brings you _
closer to the characters on screen‘. It’s a rare
feat.

Sarah Kripp talks abouttheupcoming bar crawl in the Strip

Sara Kripp is a graduate intern for
Neighbors in the Strip, an organization
whose mission is “To promote econom-
ic development opportunities while pre-
serving the personality, integrity and
character of the Strip.” The Pitt News
got a chance to talk to her about the
organization and this weekend’s Strip
Fall Crawl. ‘

What do you believe the Strip
District has to offer to college stu-
dents that is different from bars in,
say, Oakland or the South Side?

Well, the Strip is known for its
clubs, mostly dance clubs. But they also
have bars for everyone. They have a
biker bar, the Voodoo Lounge, you have
your cheap drinks at Park House in the
Strip, you have your more posh crowd
at Deja vu, and you have your dance
clubs — all of which some of the other
places don’t have to offer.

What, generally, should people who
have never been to the Strip expect
from this bar crawl?

It’s more of an open house than a
bar crawl. The Strip District’s 20 bars
and clubs that are participating are all

the Strip’s bars and clubs have a cover

What kind of response did you ‘H

receive from the bars and clubs on
the Strip when you approached them
about participating?

Oh, they were excited about it!
Everyone wanted to participate, well,
for the most part. They were pretty
excited.

Now the Strip Fall Crawl is put on by
Neighbors in the Strip. How did you
become involved with this organiza-
tion? ‘

I’m a graduate student here at Pitt
in the [Graduate Studies in Public and
International Affairs] program and
hopefully will work for a community
development organization. So I was
doing my internship with NITS, which
is the Strip District’s community devel-
opment organization. ‘

What are you hoping to do with the
funds that you raise from this event?

We’re hoping to use them for eco-
nomic development in the Strip. NTTS’

opment opportunities while preserving

bleeding (arnenorrliea) atterl yearof use.and 6896 of the worrien studied reported no rrienstriral

causes a resting state in your ovaries, When yourovaries do not release an erg monthly the
regular monthly growth of the lining of your uterus does not occurand, therefore. the bleeding
that comes wit your nonrral meistruation does not take place. When you stop using

of~the Strip.” That way, any funds that _.

we get from the bar crawl, we can put
directly into our operating budget,
which is then matched by the City of
Pittsburgh for certain projects. Right
now, we have a portal project that is try-
ing to improve all of the gateways into
the Strip, make them more aesthetically
pleasing, more welcoming.

Your mission statement talks about
the character and the personality of
the Strip. How would you define
that?

The Strip is more of a 24-hour
neighborhood. You have your markets
in the daytime; you have your dancing
and restaurants at night. It’s going all of
the time. It’s also very diverse — you

have all different types of crowds, all_ I

different types of ethnicity, all different
types of students...So we like to think of
it as a diverse, a1ways—moving, always-
awake neighborhood.

How do you foresee this event work-
ing towards those ends?

_ This fund—raiser is actually thank-
ing our normal patrons — our day
patrons and night patrons —— by offer-

ing them this discounted celebration. .
But we are also hoping to bring new.

people into the Strip who maybe
haven’t come before because they
haven’t had the right incentive. This
way, they’ll be able to get into the dif-
ferent bars and clubs for free and have
drink specials and check out the places.

Lee, a "preseason candidate for the Ray Guy
Award, which is awarded annually to the best punter
in college football, has been Pitt’s punter since the
middle of his freshman season, in 2000. Now a
senior,’ Lee has been one of the reasons why the
Panthers’ special teams are among the nation’s best.

Panthers shutout in two

close tournament games

JIMMY JOHNSON
For The Pitt News

Pitt men’s‘ soccer moved into
the Soccer America rankings after
its firstwin of the season, but the
Panthers were unable to build upon
that momentum in last weekend’s
Mayors Cup Tournament, dropping
two games. 7

The Panthers played Hartwick
(2-0). on Saturday afternoon and
Oneonta State (3-2) on Sunday,
dropping both " contests 1-0.
Hartwick, ranked No. 17 in the
nation, won the tournament.

No. 17 Hartwick 1, Pitt 0

Pitt (1-2 overall, 1-0 Big East)  

was unable to spark its offense, and
the defense was unable to prevent
the lone Hawks goal, despite Justin
Lowery.’s career-high seven saves.
Hartwick fired 12 shots,'while
Pitt managed just five. 2 ‘
Keeyan, Young ‘mustered the
best scoring chance for the
Panthers. He stole the ball from a
Hartwick defender and shot the ball

on net. He beat goalie Josh
Wagenaar, but was unable to beat
the iron. The ball deﬂected off the
crossbar an_d over the net.

The Hawks’ only score was an
unassisted goal at 67:51 by Rob
Catana, who also led the team,/with
four shots. A

Oineonta 1, Pitt 0

Pitt took the field Sunday
against Oneonta State and playeda
much different game, but ‘ended
with the same result.

Pitt’s offense showed some life,
firing 17 shots, but Jack Potter, the
goal keeper for Oneonta, made
eight (‘saves to keep the Panthers off
the scoreboard. Marco Carrizales
led the Panthers with five shots.

The Panthers made a defensive
stand and held the Red Dragons to
only five shots. Lowery recorded
two saves on the day, but Jamie
Amaoko was able to net the game’s
only goal, at 21:-48.

_ The Panthers will look to
rebound on iWednesday night, when
they take on Robert Morris at home.

Boston College upsets Pen

CHRIS CARTY
The Heights (Boston College)

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. (U-
VVIRE) — For the second straight
week, Boston College jumped out to a
dominating 14-0 lead. But as Eagle
fans found out in week one, a nice

cushion does not necessarily seal a‘

win for a team. Throw in penalties,
turnovers and a defense ' that some-
times plays during only the ﬁrst three
quarters, and that 14-0 lead can disap-
pear quickly.

Thankfully, there ‘would be no '

meltdown in Happy Valley, as the team
played much smarter football and the
defense dominated for all 60 minutes.

Before the game, coach Tom
O’Brien stressed what was necessary
for this week.  ' .

“First thing we need to do is forget
about last week. The young kids will
make mistakes, but most were coach-
able mistakes,” he said.

The mistakes in the Wake Forest
game O’Brien talked about were most

- notably the two fumbles by Quinton

Porter and the fumbled punt by Will
Blackmon. Against Penn State, Porter

played a brilliant first quarter, throw-

ing for touchdowns of 18 and 37
yards, and made good decisions the
rest of the way, given the conservative

utvtapouq-sit.

play calling. Boston College finished
the game with only one ‘turnover — a
Porter interception — compared to
Penn State’s three. .

“You want to come out and scare a
team in their own place,” Porter said.
“Shock them a little bit.” ’

‘_‘I think in all fairness, you have
got to give BC some credit,” Penn

State head coach Joe Patemo said.‘

“They played a hard game. They
jumped on us real early. They were
sharp. We went out ﬂat early and we
just couldn’t recover.”

Though BC still had more penal-
ties than Penn State, six for 40 yards
was a major improvement. The defen-
sive line was much more disciplined
— not jumping offsides on every play
— and BC avoided penalties in key
spots to stop drives.

“We were very focused,” O’Brien
said after the game. “We practiced
much better and there was a sense of
urgency. We grew up a lot in a wee .”

The defense lived up to its expec-
tations.

Against Wake Forest, the defense
was dominant for most of three quar-
ters, but secondary meltdowns in the
fourth quarter gave away 20 points and
the win. At Penn State, the defense
dominated the line of scrimmage and
gave up no big plays, making the

Nittany Lions work for every point
they got.   ’ _‘

“At 14—0,” defensive coordinator
Frank Spaziani said,"“I’,m thinking,
‘It’s a crazy game to be in this posi-
tion.’’’ a ‘,7 '6    
With nearly 55 minutes‘ left to be
played onthe road in front of rajcrowd
of 106,445’, there was.a"lo'tof time to
lose that lead. ' i  

If Penn State quarterbacks Zach
Mills and Michael Robinson didn’t
know about BC defensive end Mathius
Kiwanuka before Saturday’s game,
they were introduced to him again and
again during ‘the game.

In fact, Kiwanuka introduced him-‘

self ‘to the *rest of the country. ,-

Kiwanuka drew praise from ABC
commentators Brent Musberger and
Gary Danielson for repeatedly running
through or around the Penn, State
offensive tackles and bothering their
quarterbacks. Kiwanuka also recov-
ered a fumble in the red zone as Penn
State looked like they were going to
score. ‘ _ A
Staked to a 14-0 lead, merely
holding it would’ve been plenty to
make BC fans happy, but the defense
wanted to get in on the scoring action
as well. ; . ‘
Midway through thefirst quarter,
Mills tried to set up a simple screen

pass, but BC defensive tackle -. Tom
Martin read the play, intercepted the

"ball. and dashed toward the end zone.

The former high school fullback was

missing ‘a touchdown.
'_:.“Being an old fullback .in_high

. scliool,:I definitely wanted ‘to get in,

but.the added pounds kept meqfrom

getting in,” Martin said.

Up front, BC‘ dominated, but the
team also played very well in the sec-
ondary. The biggest difference

between this week and last was that -~

the cornerbacks and safeties kept
everyone in front of them, not allow-

ing the big plays that hauntedjthem

Blackmon was glued to his receivers,
breaking uprnumerous passes. Safety
Ryan Glasper also recovered a fumble
forced by linebacker Josh Ott at BC’s
own 5-yard line to stop a possible
Penn State scoring drive. ,-

BC did not allow previous demons
to come back to haunt them: Fewer
penalties, dominating defense and
smarter play gave ‘BC the win that it
threw away the week before.

it. It’s something that I’ll always love
to do.

TPN: What is the funniest- or‘oddest-
sounding phrase-that kickers common-
ly use?

AL: I’m not sure, but I’ll tell you, the
worst thing you can sayito a punter is,
“don’t shank it.” T hat’s the worst thing
anyone can say before you go out and
kick aball. ’ '

TPN: What goes through your mind
before a punt?

AL: I usually go out there -and swing
my leg one time to make sure it’s
loose. I obviously have to count to
make sure we have 11 guys. Then I
focus on the snap. It all happens so
fast. I just go out and do it, and I’m

golf. That’s definitely a big thing we
do all the time.

TPN: What is something that people
would be surprised to know about
you? « '

‘AL: Let me think. [laughs] I don’t

really have anything. I hunt and fish,
but people might expect that, since I’m
from [South Carolina]. Actually, since
I came up here and met [backup place-
kicker] J .B. Gibboney, I had never lis-
tened to country music, never ﬁshed,
never hunted. I met him and then I
started it all. I had lived in the South,
but I came here and became more
Southern.

TPN: Along with country, what other
kinds of music do you listen to?

AL: ‘A little bit of everything. I like
Tim McGraw, stuff like Slipknot, rap

in the Big East, and she’s performing at the level that
I knew she was capable of when-I recruited her.”

Pitt 3, Akronl A « » A

Pitt rebounded from its Friday night loss to defeat
tournament host Akron 3-1, in its first match
Saturday. The Panthers dominated Akron (2-4) in the
ﬁrst game, winning by a margin of 30-21. But the
Zips came back to win the second match 30-27,
before folding by nine—point margins in the ﬁnal two
matches. 7

Senior outside hitter Wendy Hatlestad’s 19 kills
placed second for the Panthers and were good for a
.450 hitting percentage. Her'48 kills and 27 digs over
the weekend garnered All—Tournament Honors, and,
like Ullery, it was Hatlestad’s second week in a row
enjoying the distinction.

“Wendy’s been a star forus for four years, and
she’s just playing really consistent and very relaitedj’
Beerman said. “She’ll poplthe big game once in a

Panthers finish road trip and prepare for home 0

while, and she has the ability to dominate. I’ve really
enjoyed coaching Wendy this season.”

' Junior setter Lindsey Macke had 10 digs to go
along with her 50 assists, and sophomore libero
Megan McGrane’s 33 digs were the second most in a
single game in Pitt history.

Pitt 3, American 0 .

Pitt secured the second-place finish with a sweep
of American University (2-4) on Saturday evening.

After going the distance in a 32-30 victory, the
Panthers had an easier time with the Eagles, winning
the next two games 30-28 and 30-19. Junior hitter
Megan Miller and senior hitter Sarah Rollman
chipped in 11 putaways apiece, and McGrane’s 22
digs in the match gave her a total of 158 digs on the
season. Her average of 7.18 digs per game is among
the best in the Big East. -

“Overall, we really played well this weekend,”
Beerman said. “It was one of the better weekends
I’ve had, since I’ve been here at Pitt, in terms of fin-
ishing off matches and playing really well back-to-

pener against Ball State

back.” _

Pitt will play its first home matches of the season
this weekend, as it hosts the Pittsburgh Invitational
Tournament at Fitzgerald Field House.

But the competition won’t get much easier for the
Panthers. Dayton has most of its starters returning
from last year, and Ball State and Robert Morris con-
sistently finish among the top teams in their respec-
tive conferences. Nonetheless, Beerman is optimistic
about his team’s prospects after a grueling, six-game
road schedule.

“I feel really good, because we’ve beaten Duke,
Marquette, Akron and American, and all four were
picked in the top three of their respective conference
preseason polls,” Beerman said. “And we were right

there with Texas A&M and Penn State, two top 25 .

teams. Physically, we were right in those matches,
and just a finish away from winning.

“I’m really excited about the team, and I’m look-
ing forward to seeing what we can do at home.”

Pitt’s first-round matchup against Ball State is
scheduled for Friday at 7 p.-m.
