“You can't say it‘s not formed at 10

Kusturis is the public relations director of
the Pitt student organization Students for

Cultural diversity week aims to educate Pitt

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

By the end of the week. some Pitt stu-
dents may be more aware of their own

prejudices.

The Cultural Diversity Bias Reduction
Workshop will show students how their
backgrounds shape their feelings about
others. said Ed Crist of the Office of
Residence Life. who will conduct the
workshop. It will challenge students to
confront in themselves “that which is

prejudicial. biased and almost hateful."
Crist said.

The workshop is just one pan of the
annual Celebrate Diversity Festival.
which will run from today through
Thursday at the William Pitt Union.

The purpose of the festival is not only
"to celebrate diversity and to ﬁnd ways
to stimulate discussions of issues. but
it's also to spread awareness." said Ross
Pasquale. president of the Student
Government Board.

“I think you need to be aware that

issues exist before you're ready to dis-
cuss them and hash them out." he said.

The festival will address racial. cul-
tural. gender and sexual orientation
diversity.

The festival will begin at noon on
Sept. 20 when Leon Haley. vice chan-
cellor for student and public affairs will
welcome students. faculty and staff.

Pasquale said the lnternational Fair
has always been especially enjoyable.

Professor says communication key

By Fred Bigelow
F or The Pit: .\'¢ts-5

A large color prim of a
bridge hangs in Professor
Lester Olson’s office repre-
senting. he says. "communi-
cation as a way for us to
bridge differences."

According to Olson.
Associate Professor of
Communication. that bridge
"is very relavent to our cul-
ture due to its growing diver-
sity."

“As society becomes more
diverse. it will beincreasingly
important to acknowledge
differences and to use com-
munication to bridge those
differences." says Olson.

Olson teaches Rhetorical
Criticism and is developing a
course. with a grant from
CAS. on Rhetoric and Human
Rights.. a special interest of
his.

Olson says that growing up
in the late l960’s was
"undoubtedly a factor." in

members will primarily
work on next year‘s Fish
Camp. a program designed
for incoming freshman to
become accustomed to Pitt.

“The whole freshman class
will go away to camp." she
said. "and all of our activi-
ties will take place on Labor
Day weekend."

Buchanan and other board
members borrowed the idea
of Fish Camp from Texas
A&M University. which
began the camp in I954.

Buchanan said Pitt's Fish
Camp will be in a park-like
setting and will include
competitions to establish
spirit tradition.

SGB President Ross
Pasquale also announced
there will be free student
admission to Pitt's final
home football game against
Rutgers University. Along
with free admission.
Pasquale said prizes will be
given out during the game as
part of Pitt's Student
Appreciation Day. which
was sponsored by Pitt's
Department of Athletics.

The board also discussed
its plans for minority reten-
tion and involvement in stu-
dent government at Pitt.
Board member Eric
McKinley explained that the
amount of African-
American students who
remain at Pitt is close to 33
percent.

“The number is alarming
to many of the black faculty
and black students. such as
myself." McKinley said.

McKinley said the major
programs for increasing

minority retention are

National Minority

Recruitment Seminar. The
seminar. which will take

sparking his interest in human
rights.

Another factor was his two-
year involvement in the
provost's Gender and Race
Project: The project started
in 1988 and had as its goal.
"to rethink the way we teach
communication courses to
value the diversity that stu-
dents bring to the classroom."
says Olson.

Olson describes himself as
"a product of The Great
Society.” His boyhood home
was in rural Minnesota where
both of his parents were fann-
ers. "The programs of
Lyndon Johnson made it pos-
sible for someone from my
background to go to school."
he says.

When asked if he sees him-
self as an activist because of
all the work he does involv-
ing human rights. Olson
replies: "Only in the sense
that l hope to raise conscious-
ness about human rights. I
don't have an opinion that

I’m tr_ving to move [my stu-
dents] toward."

Olson says that he explains
very explicit grading criteria
to his students to ensure that
his own opinions don‘t affect
his grading.

ln rhetorical criticism. stu-
dents "observe instances of
communication. describe and
analyze them. ask what it
adds up to. and then evaluate
or judge them." says Olson.
“In the process. one improves
one's own ability to commu-
nicate."

Olson says that his goal as
an instructor is to create a
safe environment where peo-
ple can discuss issues. He
says that he. “assumes that
intelligent people can dis-
agree. We don‘t need to
come to a concencus.”

Olson joined the Pitt faculty
in I984 “with some misgiv-
ings" he says. "about the
urban setting and Pittsburgh's
'smoky city’ reputation.“ He
was tenured in l990.

about the harm done to the
babies. but also to the

women involved. ln testing
these drugs. the womenare
put at risk.

“It's not just the babies
we're worried about. but the
safety of the women."
Kusturis said.

At the present. only three
organizations are involved
in the testing of these drugs.
Pitt is one of them.

The other two. the
University of California at
San Francisco and the
George Tillers Women's
Health Center. allow the
testing of the drug for abor-
tion purposes.

Pritchett said she strongly
protests Pitt's testing of this
drug.

"We must put a stop to the
testing.“ she said.

A petition was circulated
at the meeting to make Pitt
tnore aware of the club's
objection to the testing.

The concern for the testing
of the drugs and the dangers
it imposes upon women will
be discussed further at the
next meeting
on Oct. 3.

The speaker featured at
last night's meeting was the
co-director of Project
Multitude. Bob lrwin. Irwin
has been involved with the
pro-life movement for a
decade and has led many
protests and picketings at
different abortion clinics.

"We have to begin think-
ing. as pro-life people. in
terms of the world's view."
lrwin said.

'According to lrwin. much
of the rationale behind per-
mitting abortions comes
from a concern about over-
population.

He explained that as
human beings we do not
think in that way. but that
there are people at high lev-

els who do. lrwin said their ~

NEW YORK — Authorities
are planning an autopsy
Monday to determine what
killed former tennis star
Vitas Gerulaitis.

The body of Gerulaitis. 40.
‘was found in the bedroom of
an acquaintance. a
spokesman for the
Southhampton Village police
department on New York
state‘s Long Island said.

In 1983. a federal grand
jury voted against indicting
him on a charge of conspir-
ing to take part in a cocaine
deal. and Gerulaitis later con-
fessed to taking cocaine in
the 1970s and admitted drugs
and late—night partying had
affected his game.

Gerulaitis ranked among
the world's top 10 players
from I977 to I982 and cap-
tured the l977 Australian
Open title. He was a televi-
sion tennis commentator
after his playing career
ended. —— Reuters

President Bill Clinton scored a major political victory yester-
day, averting a clash with Congress and the American people.
as Haiti's military leaders agreed to step down in peace. A large
chunk of the credit must also go to fonner President Jimmy
Caner. Caner has been called the best ex-president even. and he
has played the role of peacemaker and ambassador-at-large for
the United States in recent years in the Middle East. North
Korea and now Haiti. Along with retired Gen. Colin Powell and
Senator Sam Nunn. Carter was involved in the last-minute
negotiations which have achieved a peaceful settlement.

For Clinton, this is a significant victory. one which could go a
long way towards aiding his re-election campaign in 1996.
However. he must be careful not to make the same mistakes
George Bush did. The Gulf War was highly successful for Bush.
but the perception that Saddam Hussein was never effectively
dealt with hurt Bush politically in the long run.

Haiti will help Clinton politically in the here and now. To
achieve lasting benefit from it, however. Haiti cannot turn into
another Somalia. The U.S. troops need to be in and out of Haiti
quickly. Let the headache be dealt with by the United Nations
— that's what it is there for. A prolonged occupation of Haiti is
sure to be unpopular. but hopefully Clinton will have learned
from the mistakes he made in Somalia. and Haiti will not turn
into another international morass for President Clinton. If he
fails to learn from past mistakes. the occupation of Haiti will
continue to be a thorn in his side. just as Hussein remaining in
power was for Bush.

Plug in Pit’r!!

The information superhighway. as it has been so adroitly
termed, is creating a technological and societal revolution in
America and the world. Before long. rates of computer literacy
will far surpass nonnal literacy rates in relevance to a nation's
society. We have all seen those wonderful commercials by
AT&T. MCI. et al., showing us the wonders to come. Those
wonders are in the future. but they will come quickly, and the
nation whose populace is best able to work within the revolu-
tion, will achieve world supremacy (or close to it).

Communication is the future. and college is the place to learn
it. We have the opportunity in this day and age to not only
increase our interpersonal communications (especially with the
opposite sex) but our intertechnological communications —
which can sometimes help interpersonal communications. By
using all of the wonderful technological gizmos available at
Pitt, we not only have fun but help to increase the computer lit-
eracy of our society.

Don't be left behind. The Pitt News highly recommends that
all Pitt students leani to use e—mail and the university computer
systems. You can have fun while preparing yourself for the
future job market (and world supremacy).

SoM€TiMe. EN Tl-le. Di$T2MT FUTURE-

Nowlin misinterprets Religious Right

n his Sept. 13 column
IRick Nowlin argued that

those Republicans who
are politically motivated pri-
marily by their religious faith
(the so-called Religious
Right) are making the party
less attractive to political
moderates and setting the
GOP up for electoral losses.
It ain't so. and here's why:

It should not have to be
pointed out that the campaign
slogan which hung on the
Clinton headquarters’ wall
did not read, “lt's the
Religious Right. Stupid" or
“It's the GOP convention,
Stupid." Instead. it was “it's
the Economy, Stupid.“ Since

their religious faith from their
political practice‘? Should
they change their agenda to
fit the will of their contempo-
raries‘? Should they spread
out their numbers to all the
political parties. so as not to
dominate any one party’?

And these questions bring
us to some better answers.
The “Religious Right" cur-
rently resides in the
Republican fold because it
has no other place to go.
Those who have conservative
social-issue beliefs have been
completely shut out of
Democratic politics. While
we are on the subject of intol-
erant political conventions.

today something of a
Religious Left in America
also. comprised of those who
see society's problems or
solutions differently than the
Religious Right. That they
are not ever vilified or scape-
goated is an indication that
those who write the news do
not find their religiously
inspired politics to be quite as
unpalatable.

William F. Buckley Jr. has
written that if we were to
wake up tomorrow with
everything advocated by Pat
Robertson's Christian
Coalition brought into
fruition. America would look
no different than it did in

Nov. 3. l992. the Religious remember that pro-life 1950. Are these such radical

target. No.Buteven

notwithstanding the fact that
in the supposed Reign of
Religious Right Terror the
GOP has managed a string of
victories (governors of
Virginia and New Jersey.
mayors of New York andLos
Angeles. senators in Texas
and Georgia). Once the GOP
has had another successful
national election. the
scapegoating will disappear.
The Religious Right is
composed primarily of people
who come to politics not
because of economic ideals
but because of a concern over
social values and their
embodiment in local laws and
practices. In assessing argu-
ments such as Mr. Nowlin's
(that the Religious Right is
dangerous for the GOP, that
they wish to replace democ-
racy with theocracy). it is
helpful to ask, if their current
behavior is so undesirable.
what would we rather have
them do? Would it be better if
they withdrew from public
life? Should they divorce

Governor Casey was cen-
sored at the Democratic con-
vention, and buttons were cir-
culated which derisively
depicted him in the Pope's
garb. Also noting Al Gore's
abortion ﬂip-flopping to his
current pro-choice status. it
would not be inaccurate to
say that one’s chances at
advancement in national
office as a Democrat are
severely restricted unless one
is pro-choice.

Those who wish the
Religious Right to separate
its faith and its politics pro-
pose to do something
unprecedented. Throughout
our history. religiously moti-
vated principles have inspired
Americans to work for the
abolition of slavery. women's
suffrage. the civil rights
movement and the anti-com-
munist movement. That there
were sincere Christians on
both sides of these issues
demonstrates the variety of
ways Christians practice their
faith. Incidentally, there is

if it were. would that neces-
sarily be a reason to jettison
it? This brings up the inter-
esting question of whether a
political party should do what
is popular or what is right.
And, while not to intend any
disrespect. it is not exactly a
ringing endorsement to cite
the campaign strategies
employed by Elsie Hillman.
who is presiding over a coun-
ty GOP that has lain inert for
threescore years. i

To conclude. it would be
more helpful to public debate
for critics to refrain from vili-
fying the Religious Right and
to simply state that they dis-
agree with them. As I have
said before. though. the ulti-
mate problem is not that too
many Christians are involved
in Republican politics. It is
that not enough of them are
able to be involved in
Democratic politics.

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 20, 1994

-I-I-1-fluenge foreign countries by investing in them

e Haitian military leaders stepped
aside without a direct fight this
week. While they have offered to

relinquish power before. they have not
previously allowed 15000 US. troops to
land in what the Pentagon has called a
"semi-permissive" landing. This has
been hailed as diplomacy backed by
might. While this may have been the tra-
dition. the changing face of international

politics must not be lost in delusions of

military grandeur.

Inﬂuence is not won by threatening
leaders who only back down once the
troops are on the way. lnstead. inﬂuence
is won by increasing the presence of the
United States within a country.

This means developing partnerships
between foreign firms and our own.
encouraging foreign investment and
moving from being a debtor nation to
being a creditor nation once again. These

involve linking the domestic policies of

countries where the United States wants
to have inﬂuence with those here. This
does not mean the military should be
used as an arm of corporations which
have multi—national holdings.

The age of gtinboat diplomacy has
ended. and it is time to look at the other
methods of exercising America's role as
the sole superpower. That which makes
the United States a “superpower" extends
beyond crude military might. Other
countries offer models for gaining politi-
cal capital throughout the world.

The British government. for example.
recently appropriated $77.5 million in aid
to Vietnam. This was not merely money
handed over for goveniiiient projects. but

rather money used as encouragement for
the Vietnaniese to do business with
Bntlsh firms.

The United States and Great Britain
are excellent examples of how security-
based l'c‘l;tll0nsl'llps are not applicable for
a lasting intemational partnership. Each
nation has its own concerns within its

other. So. before they

new links are being developed. British
inﬂuence in the area of domestic policy
has been felt in Pittsburgh. where the
waterfront redevelopment conference
featured British solutions for dealing
with sites polluted by the industry which
occupied them. Cleanup methods used in
Britain could be successfully applied
here to make environmentally damaged
sites into productive iiidustnal parks once
again.

Tuming from the British to Pitt's past.
in the 1960s. Pitt attempted to develop an
exchange program with Cuban universi-
ties. According to l)r. Wesley Posvar.
former chancellor of the University of
Pittsburgh. the State Department vetoed
the idea in order keep up the boycott. The
Central Intelligence Agency loved the
idea. saying it was just the way to begin

are in power. Third. bringing foreign stu-
dents to study here gives them a favor-
able impression of the United States (at
least. this is the goal). Therefore. once
they return home. they will be vvell-dis-
posed to American inﬂuence. as opposed
to screaming about Yankee imperialism.

This. then. is a prescription for what
the United States ought to do as it helps
Haiti restore its democracy. There is a
tremendous opportunity for the United
States to steer the future of Haiti onto a
course which will maintain stability in
the coming years.

The first step has already been taken.
The refugees being housed in
(iuantanamo Bay. Cuba. have already
volunteered to serve in the next Haitian
police force. The United States has
already been training them.

There is an untapped resen oir of talent
which has yet to be utilized. Thousands
of refugees ﬂed from Haiti and came to
the L'nited States. Those who were not
repatriated are already favorably dis-
posed toward .—\menca. Universities and
the gov emnient ought to be training these
people to move into political posts. Since
there has been so much debate over what
to do with the refugees. we should offer
them scholarships conditional upon their
return to Haiti and service within the
government. lt would be less costly than
having to ni;imt;iin a prolonged military
operation. Techriically and humani.stic;il-
ly trained people build nations. not sol-
diers. Somalia ought to be ample evi-
dence for this.

Statesnianship has prevailed. and. once
again. the pen is mightier than the sword.
()r at least. it could become so.
Universities have a leading role in this
and should seize the opportunity by
offering to educate Haitian refugees to
rebuild their country. The opportunities
may be readily apparent. but the pay-off
would be well worth the investment. The
essence of statesmanship. as defined by
Walter l.ippman. is “seeing the realities
of the situation beneath the surface and
on them."

The reality‘ is that soldiers and multina-
tional peacekeeping forces aren't the key
to stability. Educiited people to serve in
the government. which the United States

is in a unique position to provide. is the i

only true hope for the future of Haiti.

But Jut‘k.vuIt is u A/m'nt¢'r (‘IIIP/()_\’t’(' of

the Criiii'It.

Columnist Dickensheets equals partisan politics

Dear Editor.

This letter is written in response to the article "US
should get out of Haiti." Tony l)icken.slieets is quite
bold to call the people of Haiti “semi-illiterate peasants"
and then say they don't comprise a democracy for that
reason. Just because the Haitian people are not educated
well doesn’t mean that they are incapable of maintain-
ing a democracy. How educated do you think the aver-
age American was at the beginning of our nation‘.’

Haiti was a democracy before the military dicatorship
took over. They were at democracy in their last election
when they voted in Aristide with 78 percent of the vote.

LETTERS

 

Certainly a percentage any politician would enjoy. This
election was fair and was supervised by international
observers. The United States is simply trying to reinstate
the democratically elected goveninient. is it not the goal

of the United States to protect and ensure the survival of
democracy on this planet‘?

Furthermore. Mr. l)icken.slieets stated that the
President had to have (.'oiigressional approval to invade
Haiti. This is false. The president may send troops any-
where in the world for any reason for 90 days without
(‘ongressiorial approval. After this time he mtist receive
approval from (‘ongress to continue the operation. Mr.
l)ickcn.shcets should do his homework before making
such statements. His column reads as partisan politics.

t this
point
in
history, there
are three
» questions
burning me
up with
curiosity.
First
of all, what is
the meaning

Columnist
Tom
Schneider

of life?

Second of all, what is that
long string of inedible ﬂeshy
material that hangs from a
peeled banana?

Finally, is there anyone in
the world that can stop, or
even slow down, the
Frankenstein creation known
as Penn State?

Growing up in Pittsburgh
and being a Pitt fan since Dan
Marino’s curly hair was really
out of control, it gives me a

sharp twinge of excruciating

pain to mention the words
Penn State and national
championship in the same
breath.

But after watching the
Lions thoroughly embarrass a
respectable Iowa Hawkeyes
teamon Saturday, the notion
of J oePa getting his third
national crown seems more
and more logical. ’

I wish I could believe that I
am jumping the gun on this
whole thing. I would appreci-
ate it if someone could con-
vince me that Penn State’s
maniacal run will hit a brick
wall in Ann ‘Arbor on Oct. 15
when Michigan should have
preseason Heisman front-run-
ner Tyrone Wheatley back
from injury.

However, you may remem-
ber that the Lions were sup-
posed to have their hands full
with USC last week.

Instead, the Trojan defense
looked to have all the consis-
tency of a wet Kleenex
against the PSU offense, as

Pitt's loss

to OSU

an im rovement
over ' 3 slaughter

COLUMBUS, Ohio

loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes
on Saturday afternoon.

T" Ohio State.

the sun’s luminous smile

praised the Panthers’ effort,

and most importantly, their

63-28 Buckeye spanking at Pitt
Stadium. ‘

“We were in the game for

In the second half, however,
improvement from last year’s
three quarters,” head coach

'Johnny Majors said. “I would

say to some degree we were
out of the game in the first
quarter last year. That’s a tough
consolation, but it’s improve-

ment.”

Just Ohio State’s first posses-
sion of the game gave proof
that this year would be differ-
ent. Last year, Butler By’not’e
took the opening kickoff of the
game for an 89-yard, virtually
untouched, touchdown return.

After the return, the No. 11-
ranked Buckeyes exploded for
three more touchdowns in the
first quarter and went into the
half with a more than comfort-
able 35-0 lead.

Conversely, the Panthers
received the opening kickoff
this year, and were forced to
punt. It only took OSU two
plays in its first possession to
try to Christen the scoreboard

. like last year. But the results

would be different this time.
The Buckeyes’ attempted
flea—flicker was disturbed by
the rush of linebacker Jason

Pitt gets commitment from Georgia star

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

Pitt basketball coach Ralph
Willard has taken an early leap
into the recruiting frenzy by
acquiring an oral commitment
from highly-touted guard
Vonteego Cummings.

Cummings, a 6-3 point
guard from Thomson High
School in Georgia, called a
press conference yesterday
afternoon to announce that he
has chosen to attend Pitt next
year

Willard landed Cummings,
who is a Street and Smith '5
All-American, over recruiting

giants like Michigan,
Minnesota, Connecticut and
Georgia.

Thomson H.S. coach Mike
Thomas considers Cummings
to be one of the best players in
the country and says that he is
a scorer as well as a point
guard.

“He’s a natural point guard,
but he’s more than that,”
Thomas said. “What was Jerry
West? What was Oscar
Robertson? They were lead
guards, but they scored 25
points a game. [Cummings] is
kind of a throwback in that
sense.

“He’s not just strictly a point

Curtis Martin is question-
able for Saturday's game.

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The running game has been a
staple of the Pitt offense since
the begining of the season.
Curtis Martin and Billy West
have both established them-
selves as solid running backs.
These fans who are used to
excellence in the backﬁeld may
be a little confused this week. In
fact, they may not be sure who
is on the field.

The Panther running backs
have been rocked by injuries.
The top four backs Curtis
Martin, Billy West, Tim
Colicchio and Chris Patton are
all nursing injuries that may not
make them available’ for
Saturday’s game against Boston
College. ‘

“We’ve got a lot of people

guard. Versatility is probably
his best asset.”

As a junior last season,
Cummings tallied 24 points,
5.0 assists, 6.8 rebounds and
3.3 steals per game. He also
shot 52 percent from the field
and 69 percent from the free
throw line.

Thomas said one of the rea-
sons Cummings chose Pitt is

’ because of the guard-oriented

system Willard runs.
Cummings was also impressed
with Willard’s ability to
improve his players.

“[Willard] got some kids at
Western Kentucky that proba-
bly weren’t highly recruited,

questiono

banged up,” coach John Majors
said. “Tai1back has been deci-
mated.”

The carnage began in week
two against Ohio. Curtis
Martin, who ran for 251 yards
in the season opener against
Texas, sprained his right ankle
while blocking during the last
play of the first quarter after
only eight carries. He left the
game and has not returned
since. But Pitt hardly missed a
beat as sophomore Billy West
stepped in and ran for 226
yards. Senior Tim Colicchio
chipped in with 31 yards on
three carries, including a touch-
down.

The situation got much worse
in week three as West was lost
after getting leveled by Ohio
State linebacker Lorenzo Styles

‘Injuries, page 12

but that turned out to be pretty
good players,” Thomas said.

Cummings, an All-State
selection in Georgia, led a
Thomson team last year that
finished 24-5 and lost in the
first round of the state touma-
ment. In Cummings’ sopho-
more year, Thomson was elim-
inated in the second round, and
when he was a freshman, the
team lasted to the Georgia
final four. Cummings started
allfour years.

Thomas would not comment
on whether Cummings has
passed the SATs. Cummings,
however, cannot sign an offi-

Slippery Rock, I9-0

By Matt Grofl‘

Senior Staff Writer

Pitt Rugby rolled past
Slippery Rock University 19-
0 in Saturday's muddy’ con-
test. lifting the team into a tie
for first place in the league.

The win pushed the
Panthers to 2-0 and another
step clos-
er to
t h e i r
s h o w -
d o w n
a g a i n st
t h I e
naﬁonah
I y -
ranked Penn State Nittany
Lions on Oct. 8.

'‘I don’t think either team
had an advantage because of
the weather on Saturday."
rugby vice president Dave
Jaeger said about the game
which was played in the rain
and mud.

"We weren‘t necessarily
that much faster than Slippery
Rock. but our advantage was
our discipline. We were care-
ful about the way we held
on to the ball and passed the
ball."

Pitt got on the board in the
first half with wing Chris
Wherthy's try following a
kick by fly half Neil Scott.

Brian Vahosky. an eight
man. said that Scott's kick
was typical of Pitt's strategy
in the first half.

“It was so sloppy on the
field. the conditions made it
hard to pass." Vahosky said.
“So we tried to do a lot of
kicking.“

Scott's kick went into
SRU’s “try zone." the equiva-
lent of the end zone in foot-
ball. and the kick was recov-
ered for five points by
Wherthy.

“He just beat everyone else
to the ball.“ Vahosky said.

He said Pitt‘s second—half
scoring was more team—ori-
ented. “We manhandled their
pack and pushed them into
their try zone." Vahosky said
about Mike Barron's try late
in the game.

Pitt also scored in the sec-
ond half on a try by scrum
half Ed Davis. Following a
penalty by SRU. Pitt was
awarded the ball on SRU's
five-meter line. Davis took an
eight-man pitch and dove into
the try zone for the score.

Sean Tonkin converted two
of three extra point attempts.
which are each worth two
points. for a total of four
points.

“We have a lot of depth this
year." Andrew Park said
about the Panthers‘ B-side
team. which also won its
game on Saturday. "And there
are a lot of guys playing B
side who will be able to step
in and play A side."

This win. coupled with last
weeks victory" over the high-
ly-regarded George Mason

 

University team. has many or
Pitt’s players pumped up
about this season.

"We're looking to go to the
Midwest regional playoffs
this year by either winning-
our [league] or getting a wild
card berth." Vahosky said.

If Pitt manages to win its
league. called a "union" in
rugby. it would end Penn
State's recent domination.

Penn State won the union
last year and went on to win
the Midwest regional. advanc-
ing the team to the final four
in the country along with
i\'avy. Air Force and Cal-
Berkley.

(}‘aI-Berkley captured the
national championship. while
Penn State finished with a No.
4 national ranking.

Other teams in Pitt’s union
include West Virginia

The Panthers would go on to
force four more turnovers
through the course of the game.

“Before the season we talked
about trying to seek improve-
ment in every area. which we
have.” Majors said. “We
improved in every area of the
football team.”

“What's encouraging is that
the things we did not make the

said.

An argument could be made
that Pitt scored a season high
28 points against OSU last year
and only scraped three points
this year. so there is no
improvement at all. it would
appear that Pitt regressed. if
anything.

But the fact of the matter is
that the Panthers scored all 28
points against Ohio State's sec-

ond- and third-string and could
not muster anything against its
massive first-string defense. To
illustrate how far out of reach
the game was. OSU coach John
Cooper opted to use his backup
kicker in the third quarter.

This year the Panthers played
well enough to keep Ohio
State's first-tram defense until
the fourth quarter.

Offensively. Pitt's three
points were not an accurate
barometer to how it moved the
ball. Pitt running backs rushed
for 140 yards. 87 of them com-
ing from Billy West. Tim
Colicchio ntshed for 46.

“In the first half we moved
the ball with some pleasure and
made a few plays." Majors
said.

Last year. the Panthers‘
backs only ran for 75 yards.
and OSU contained Curtis
Martin for 57.

The reason why Pitt's
improved running success did
not equate into more points is
that every time the Panthers

of Pennsylvania and next
week's opponent. California
University of Pennsylvania.

“This year the team is a
tighter unit and more physi-
cal." Jaeger said.

"More of our younger play-
ers are consistently coming to
practice and establishing a
good foundation for the team
and the future."

However. despite Pitt's
improvement over last year.
Jaeger said there is a lot to be
done between now and when
the Panthers take the field in
three weeks in Happy Valley.

“In order to beat Penn State.
we'll need to fine tune our
skills and get into better
shape." he said. “If we can
control our aggression..we can
keep the pressure on them the
entire game."

laeger said he believed the
team was playing at its top
level about 75 percent of the
game against SRU.

“We'll need to give 120 per-
cent the entire game to beat
Penn State." Jaeger said.

As Pitt gears up for the
showdown. several members
of the team said they are con-
fident they can be ready.

“We definitely haven’!
reached our potential yet."
Vahosky said.

Rugby Notes: Pitt's B-side
team won its game against
SRU. 30-5. Freshman Matt
Fleisman led the scoring with
two tries. while Brian
McNally and Barry McCoy
each had one. Darin McCall
added two penalty kicks.

on a botched pass play. West
left the field under his own
power with a separated shoul-
der and his status is uncertain
for Saturday.

Colicchio was also hurt
against the Buckeyes. Near the
end of the game he injured his
ankle after a burst up the mid-
dle. Despite the fact that he
never left the field. he too is
questionable for Saturday.

Patton, who walked on in
l993 is also banged up, and his
status remains uncertain.

"There is a big question at
tailback." Majors said. “I don't
know if we're even going to be
ableto line up a tailback at
P"3CUC¢ loday. We may have to
get a fullback or somebody to
stand in.

“All of our tailbacks are
banged up at this time."

To make matters worse. two
starting offensive linemen are
also questionable for Saturday.
Guards Brian Curran and
Beggre Thomas both were
"llufefl against the Buckeyes.

“Brian got his ankle rolled
up on in a game two weeks

“But he said today that his

sents the Pac-10 in Pasadena
will not be able to defeat
those .\’ittany Lions.

This presents a problem. If
Penn State runs through the
rest of the season like they

have in their first three games.

they could conceivably go to
the Rose Bowl as the nation's
top team.

Add to that the very likely
possibility that the Pac-10
champ will not be in the
nation’s top 10. What you end
up with is an unimpressive
national championship game.

Meanwhile. the bowl coali-
tion already has the champi-
ons and second-place teams

from a few good conferences
obligated to a set of several
major bowls. The teams that
could be in this mix include
Nebraska. Florida and Miami.
What you have there is a
much more interesting
matchup of two of the
nation's top three teams.

In the end. that could be the
difference between an obvi-
ous decision and pulling hairs
for the nation's pollsters.

And the difference between
an ecstatic and unnecessarily
disappointed Happy Valley.
