Drag monarchy dolls up,

dances for donations

Wearing a dress crafted out of newspaper
along with fake breasts molded with panty-
hose and sniffed with decorative Halloween
spiderwebs, FuchsiaXYZ nervously stormed
down the runway for the ﬁrst time in her ca-
reer, lip—synching “Eros and Apollo,” a song
popularized by the Studio Killers, as audience
members showered her with dollar bills.

Patrick Geraci, a junior linguistics major
playing FuchsiaXYZ for the night, ensembled
his drag show get—up and bosom in just more
than a day to join 18 drag queens and kings
for Pitt’s 14th annual Drag Show.

Hosted by Rainbow Alliance on Thursday

at 9 p.m. in the William Pitt Union Assembly V
Room, the show attracted an audience of I

about 500 students. Men and women dressed
in drag and took to the catwalk to raise money
for the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, a_ local
organization that strives to prevent the spread
of HIV infection and provide services for those
infected. The performers strutted and danced
while collecting donations during the two-
hour event. S

Serving as master of ceremonies, Mar-
sha Monster Mallow — a royal queen on the
Pittsburgh drag scene —— introduced each of
the performers to the stage. She encouraged

It’s not Halloween, but clusters of min-
iature Spider-Mans, Batmans and Su-
permans will be parading around Pitt’s
campus this Sunday.

HeroiKs, a student organization
dedicated to motivating children to
engage in service in their community
regardless of age or family income level,
will host its fourth annual Pittsburgh
Super Stroll on Sunday. Registration
for the 1.5-mile charity walk begins at
noon in the William Pitt Union, and the
walk starts at 1 p.m. The route starts at
the Union, loops around other campus
locations including Posvar Hall and
Schenley Park, and then returns to the
Union.

The stroll will feature children clad
in their favorite superhero costumes.
While the event is free, heroiKs requests
a donation of $5 per child participant
or $10 per adult participant

Each year, heroiKs donates the pro-
ceeds from the walk to the Free Care
Fund at Children’s Hospital of Pitts-
burgh. The fund assists families who
struggle with medical expenses.

This year, heroiKs will also donate a
portion of the Super Stroll’s proceeds to
the Unity Lutheran Community Mission
after—school program because the group

Kid crusaders strive to raise funds for others in need

began working with the organization in
fall 2012. The program provides chil-
dren in the Homewood neighborhood
with a meal and a place to do homework
four evenings out of the week.
Members of heroiKs who attend the
program at the Redeemer Lutheran

, School in Penn Hills, which islrun by the

Unity Lutheran Community Mission, as-
sist the children with their homework.

Kaitlyn Goerl and Thomas Bryant-
founded heroiKs in fall 2011, and the
organization‘ currently has 15 members.
The duo came up with the idea for the
group when they noticed a common
interest among the preschoolers they

tutored in Pitt’s jumpstart program in

2011 — superheroes.

“A lot of kids in our classroom were"

really into superheroes,” Goerl saidf 
Goerl said the “hero” in the name
heroiKs came from the superhero theme
of the annual walk, and the capitalized
letter ‘K’ represents their group’s focus
on kids.
Goerl, who graduated from Pitt in

2012 and studies occupational therapy .

at Pitt’s graduate school, and Bryant,
who graduated from Pitt in 2011, met
while volunteering at _]umpStart, a na-
tional nonprofit organization that has
a chapter at Pitt run by Pitt’s Student
Affairs Ofﬁce. Bryant now works as a
site manager forjumpstart.

The program pairs undergraduate
students with preschool students from
low-income backgrounds in the Pitts-
burgh area. The students work together
for 15 hours each week to improve the
preschoolers’ reading skills during the

_schoolyear. ._ 1,  .

Goerl, now a co"-business manager
for heroiKs, said she and Bryant started
the organization to provide preschool
students with opp_ortuniti-es to give
back to the community. Jurrrpstart fo-
cuses on children who receiiféiﬁnancial
aid, she said, but these children aren’t
always aware that they can participate
in community service projects, too.

“Our main goal is for young people
to see the ‘power and influence they

 have in their community,” Br:/Vyant said.

Laura Carless, vice president of
hieroi'il<s and a senior studying com-
munications, said the group meets once
a week on Monday or Tuesday nights at
9 p.m. in the William Pitt Union.

She added that the organization is
ﬂexible with participation.

“You could either just volunteer with
us  or just occasionally help out with
planning the Super Stroll,” she said.

. “It’s a very casual group.”

Sarah Torres, co-business manag-
er of heroiKs, said she can’t wait to
act as a superhero in this year’s Su-
per Stroll, where she’ll be playing the

“Child Hero,” who guides the children
through the course.

“The point of our walk is showing’

that you can serve yourself, the commu-
nity and the environment,” Torres said.

Goerl said the walk usually hosts be-
tween 100 and 120 participants, but the
number of child participants has sig-
nificantly grown throughout the years.

“Throughout the walk, the child is
trying to decide which cause to choose,
and by the end of it, they realize they
can do a little bit _to help every cause,”
Torres said.

To raise money for the Super Stroll,
heroiKs hosted a “Hunger Games” event
last fall.

The group invited Pitt student
groups to participate in events inspired
by the young-adult dystopian trilogy
“The Hunger Games” on the Cathedral
of Learning Lawn. Bryant said student
groups registered with “tributes,” or
volunteers. Members from jumpstart
Pittsburgh, multicultural sorority Zeta

. Sigma Chi and the University of Pitts-

burgh Occupational Therapy Associa-
tion participated in the event, as well.
as independent pairs of students.

said, and tributes competed in different

the audience to donate at the door, have “safe
sex all the way” and to toss the performers a
few dollars.

“I’m like Ronald McDonald’s and Wendy’s
f"‘cking love child right here,” Mallow said of
her costume and makeup, which featured a
curly red wig that added almost two feet to
her height.

Noah Sanders, known as Mona Lott on
stage, and Danielle Quigley, known as Pit-
bull Terrier, dressed as pop stars Kesha and
Pitbull and danced to the two performers’ hit

song, “Timber.” Aspart of their performance,
Sanders and Quigley faked aﬁght for the mi-
crophone, showing that either the king or
queen would have to go down. The audience

gave the lip-synching duo astanding ovation.

Aramae Bader, a junior accounting ma-
jor, returned to see the Pitt Drag Show for
the second time. Bader appreciated all of the
performances andwas undecided onwho was
her favorite king or queen.

“They all have such realized characters,”
Bader said. .

Throughout the show, Brandon Benjamin,
president of Rainbow Alliance, distributed
condoms to members of the audience. Ben-

jamin, a junior majoring in linguistics, per-
formed in the Drag Show last year.

Benjamin enjoyed performing so muchlast
year that he volunteered to return to the stage
for the audience compeﬁtion “Lip-synch for
Your Life.” Mona Lott and Pitbull Terrier se-
lected ﬁve students from the crowd, including
Benjamin, to demonstrate their dancing skills
onstage as the audience erupted with cheers.

Benjamin tied up his button-down shirt to
display his midriffbefore decidingto ditch his
shirt completely, leavinghim in his undershirt
as he joined in the dance for donations.

A performance by Chance Thomas, also
known as Chance Encounters, was dedicat-
ed to Peter Mastracci, a 2010 Pitt graduate
who passed away in December 2013 and was
an integral part of Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance
during his undergraduate career. Thomas
lip-synched to “Nothing More,” a somber,
sorrowful switch from the upbeat dance num-
bers. Aslideshow ofphotographs of Mastracci
played behind Thomas as he performed.

Michael O’Brien, vice president of Rain-
bow Alliance and chair of the Drag Commit-
tee, organized the venue, the security and the
performers for the show. O’Brien considered
the show his pet project of the semester.

“I personally think it all came together

beautifully,” O’Brien, a sophomore German
and Russian languages major, said.

O’Brien didn’t have time to participate
in the show this year, but he said he’s look-
ing forward to introducing his drag queen
persona to the world next year.

“You can look forward to seeing me on the
stage very, very soon,” O’Brien said.

It takes love and support to tackle the
stage as a drag queen, and the performers
had strongfan bases rooting for them inthe
audience. ‘

Rachel Lehman-Merrick, a junior studio
arts and physics major, attended the show for
a second year to support her friend Trevor

Bublitz, who performedasAmbrosia Bubbles.

“They’re a lot better dancers than you
think,” Lehman-Merrick said, adding that

parts of the show. I

“there are already so many organizations

Hanlon buys topping ingredients and

OPINIONS

Structural deﬁciencies cause of student
government membership instability

David Rosenthal
Guest Columnist

As a former Board member, Allo-
cations Committee member and
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee member, I have heard the
entire gambit of criticisms against
the Student Government Board:
the organization is too exclusive,
the Allocations Committee is not
transparent, the Boardfocuses too‘

much on allocations.

These are all fair critiques, andl
have witnessed each one ﬁrsthand.
If not for the behest of a fellow fra-
ternity brother to join the Govem-'
mental Relations Committee as a
freshman, I would have probably

never heard of SGB. This does not .

bode well for an institution that is
designed to represent the voice of
the undergraduate student body,
but unfortunately, it seems that

nothing changes from yearto year. i

This is not to say that the repre-
sentatives are apathetic or that no
one in student government cares
about these criticisms. On -the

contrary, chairpersons and Board. V

members alike spend countless
hours trying to address the com-
plaints. The issue, however, runs
much deeper than any one individu-
al. The problems associated withthe

Student Government Board stem -

from the archaic structure by which
the organization governs. i

The problems are made clearer
when comparing how our SGB op-
erates relative to similar schools of
Pitt’s size and stature. But ﬁrst, it’s
necessary to understand the orga-
nization’s structure.

There is a single president who
oversees eight Board members, all

. of whom are elected at large. These

nine individuals, in turn, appoint
the various committee chairpersons

and the entire Allocations Commit— '

tee, which oversees the allocation
of nearly $1 million out of the $2.5
million Student Activities Fund to
student organizations each year.
This means that in a representa-
tive body, only nine students are
elected and the rest are decided by
appointment.
BeyondthechairandAllocations
appointments, there are of course
volunteers on each committee, but
these volunteers are not held ac-
countable to any student voter. So
in reality, there are approximately
25 students who oversee Student
Govemment’s entire operation. It
is no wonder that SGB is viewed as
an exclusive organization when 25
students — most of whom were
not elected — represent the Uni-
versity’s more than 18,000 under-
graduate non-College of General
Studies students. f
e Other issues arise as a result of
this structure. One such issue is the

fact that the executive, legislative ‘

and judicial branches are all com-
bined into one single governing

entity. The Board — which is an »

executive branch jointly comprised
of the President and Board mem-
bers —— selects and oversees not
onlythejudicialbranchintheform
of thejudicial Committee, but also
the legislative branch in the form
of the Allocations Committee and
other conditional committees. In-
stead of having a legislature that is
elected by the student body, Pitthas

. anexecutive—appointed legislature.

The Board delegates and oversees
legislative ﬁmctions, which clouds
any possible distinction between
the three branches of government.
In reality, there is not a representa-
tive legislature, because the only
elected individuals —- the members
of the Board — act as the executive

branch. There is a great» degree of
power concentrated in the Board,

and for nine individuals, this is

simply too much work to be a truly
effective body.

So how does Pitt’s student gov-
ernment structure differ from the
likes of say, UNC-Chapel Hill — a
university of similar size? Orto Penn
State — a university with a similar
private—public partnership?

Upon examining the two
schools, one will see the stark
contrast and the strange enigma
of pseudo—representation that is
Pitt SGB.

For UNC, the Student Govem—
ment is set up to have an Executive
Branch with a president, vice pres-
ident and a slew of other oﬂicer—
cabinet positions. Separate from
this branch is the Student Congress,
which oversees the legislative ef-
forts of the Student Government. Fi-
nally, there is the_Student Supreme
Court, whichis incharge of all judi-
cial matters. This is quite distinct

_ from the president-and-board sys-

tem underwhich Pitt operates. The
student leaders and representatives
atUNC operatewithinthree distinct
branches of government that have
the proper checks and balances,
similar to our own federal govem—
ment. Pittfails to have these neces-
sary checks and balances, which
contributes to much of the frustra-

' tion and inefﬁciencies found within

our student government.

Instead of having Student
Congress representatives elected
at large, representatives for the
congress are differentiated into
districts based on living location,
which means that each represen-
tative is held accountable by a spe-
ciﬁc group of students. Members

running for executive or legislative positions
run completely separately, strengthening
the distinction between the executive and
legislative branches, and the legislature is the
only body in charge of funding decisions for
student organizations.

The elected president appoints justices
to the Student Supreme Court who have to
be approved by the Student Congress. The
difference here is that two completely sepa-

rate branches of government must come to
an agreement to appoint members to a third
branch of government, which gives the judi-
cial branch more ethos and decision-making
legitimacy. As it stands at Pitt, the president
and Board appoint a judicial chairperson,
who, in turn, selects ajudicial Committee.
Because of the intertwining of the executive
and legislative branches at Pitt, the judicial
system loses legitimacy because there is no
check on the selection of its members.

For Penn State, a similar system applies.
There are three separate branches of govem-
ment, with the General Assembly member-
ship beingbased on living location, aswellas

school affiliation. Again, unlike Pitt’s Alloca-
tions Committee, elected representatives are
in charge of funding, so members are held
directly accountable by their constituents.
Another added beneﬁt of having elected
representatives in charge of funding requests
means that the executive branch can focus
on campaign initiatives instead of being
tied up with funding issues. Furthermore,
instead of having 25 students bear the entire
workload, UNC and Penn State have a much
clearer workload division for ‘each branch
of government. In total, UNC has more than
40 elected officials and Penn State has more
than45, compared to the nine that Pitt elects.

Because both schools have much more expan-
sive student governments when considering
elected and appointed oﬂicials and individu-
als represent speciﬁc constituents of students,
outreach is much easier, and the student gov-
ernment can be more inclusive.

Until Pitt adopts a system that does .not
encourage the exclusion and conﬁision as-
sociated with a board style of governance,
the same complaints will continue to arise
with no available solution in sight. If we truly
want a student government that represents
the needs and interests of the undergraduate
student body, major reforms need to be made
to the structure by which SGB governs. I

Panthers don’t feel weighed down by slow start in conference play

Dan Sostek
Stqff Wrz'ter

It’s never easy to start a season winless in
conference play, but Pitt’s women’s ten-
nis team, which has started its inaugural
season in the Atlantic Coast Conference
0-7, appears to be taking the bumps in
stride.

The Panthers, who have lost to Vir-
ginia Tech, Wake Forest, Maryland,
Miami, Clemson, Boston College and
Virginia, are doing more than just taking
each defeat and moving‘ on to the next

match, though. They are learning from "

their experiences.

“We knew that it would be really
hard, especially in our first season in
the ACC,” Taylor Washington, one of the
three seniors on the team, sgd. “Every

game and every match is an opportunity

to improve.”

Alex Santos, currently in his ﬁrst year
as Pitt’s head coach following a success-
ful stint as an assistant coach at the Uni-
versity of Miami, agrees wholeheartedly
with Washington. _

“I deﬁnitely don’t»feel this season is
disappointing,” Santos said, conﬁrm-

’ ing that he’s not the least bit shaken by

the tough stretch following"a.3-0 start
to the season. “We aren’t focusing on
winning and losing. as much as we are
on improving from match to match. The
team understands that. They’re in good
spirits.”

Despite the inauspicious start to-the
season, certain Pitt players have seen
their fair share of success, particularly
freshman Audrey Ann Blakely.

Blakely, a true freshman from Wyo-
missing, Pa., secured her role as the

Panthers’ No. 1 singles player early on
and has not looked back since. Currently
ranked 114th in the nation, she made
her biggest splash by defeating Miami’s
Kelsey Laurente, who was then ranked
40th in the country.

Blakely currently leads the team in

 

victories, sporting a 14-4 record and a
team-best 3-3 record in ACC play. In the
process, she’s earned attention, respect
and praise from her teammates.

“I think she has been doing a tremen-
dousjob, obviously,” Santos said. “She’s a

great competitor and is very mature. She
plays well above her age, and is»one of
the most improved players in the ACC.”

Blakely was the Pennsylvania Inter-
scholastic Athletic Association’s singles
high school state champion in 2013, and
her sisters Grace and Martha played
tennis at South Carolina and Virginia
Tech, respectively. Even though it seems
there’s hereditary talent there, Blakely
does not hesitate to give credit to having
strong support from teammates.

“In high school, I did a lot of national
competition,” she said. “I always felt that
I competed best when I competed with
a team rather than by myself. I’ve been
able to do that at Pitt, and I think that’s
why I’ve been able to do so well.”

And despite being accustomed to suc-
cess — Blakely went 32-0 in her senior
year of high school, not losing a single
set — she has completely adopted the
team’s emphasis on learning and im-
proving.

“From the beginning of the fall to
right now, the whole team has improved
so much,” Blakely said. “We’re really
right there, even if the team score isn’t
showing it. We’re learning to compete.”

BASEBALL

Pitt gets chance to restart win streak at home vs. Georgia Tech

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

After dropping its only mid-week con-
test this week at West Virginia, Pitt
baseball looks to get back to its win-
ning ways this weekend against Georgia
Tech. »
The loss in baseball’s Backyard Brawl
ended the Panthers’ ﬁve-game winning
streak, which included a sweep of con-
ference foe Duke that boosted the Pan-
thers’ record over .500.

But another three ACC wins will
not come easy this time around when
the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets visit

Charles L. Cost Field -— where the Pan-
thers are undefeated this year — for a
three-game set. Georgia Tech (15-10,
5-4 ACC) entered the Baseball America
rankings for‘ the ﬁrst time this week,
and will arrive in Pittsburgh ranked
No. 23.

Pitt (12-11, 4-5 ACC) isn’t close to the
Yellow Jackets in any ranking or poll
but has a chance to gain some ground
in the ACC’s Coastal Division. A series
sweep would pull the Panthers out of
last place in the division.

Rhys Aldenhoven, Joe Harvey and
Matt Wotherspoon are listed as head
coach Joe Jordano’s projected start-

-~_r_»1¢...-;.—.-x.-~.. _. ‘ ‘-—,».--.1--‘A .1 -. 5

ers for the weekend’s slate of games.
Georgia Tech will counter with Josh
Heddinger, Devin Stanton and Mat-
thew Grimes.

Aldenhoven (2-1, 3.60 ERA), a senior
right—hander, has pitched most con-
sistently for the Panthers this season
out of the starting rotation. He earned
his ﬁrst conference win last weekend
by scattering two runs on six hits over
seven innings of work while striking
out ﬁve Duke hitters.

Aldenhoven’s earned run average is
the lowest of any Pitt weekend starter,
and he leads the team in innings pitched

_and strikeouts.

._-. k.. —. -r.»---.-.... 7- ct» -- . ~ I -~ -~ .

The senior from Victoria, Austra-
lia, matches up against the 6—foot-4,
221—pound Heddinger, but the Yellow
Jacketsace hasn't taken the strides he
was projected to take this season after
he went undefeated last year.

Heddinger (1-1, 4.38 ERA) has given
up 31 hits in 24 2/3 innings this year,
and is allowing opposing batters to hit
.301 against him.

Stanton (1-0, 3.68 ERA) makes his
third start of the year for Georgia Tech
on Saturday, while Grimes (3-0, 3.57
ERA) looks to win his fourth game in

as many starts.

After Aldenhoven, the Panthers have
received inconsistent pitching from
the rest of their rotation. Matt Woth-
erspoon, who opened as the team’s No.
1 starter, is now third in the weekend
rotation, while Joe Harvey has moved
from his role as a reliever in the bull-
pen to the second spot in the pitching
rotation.

Wotherspoon, a senior right—hander,
has struggled mightily this season after
ﬁnishing 9-3 last year. This year, the
senior from Mountain Top, Pa., owns
a 2-3 record and a 7.76 ERA.

Opponents have registered 53 hits in
Wotherspoon’s 31 1/3 innings of work,
and he has allowed 32 total runs to cross
home plate (27 earned-) in six: starts.

Despite the unexpected struggles of
the starting rotation, Harvey’s emer-
gence has provided the Panthers with
a source of hope.

A right-handed redshirt junior, _

Harvey (1-1,. 3.81 ERA) has given Pitt
a welcomed boost as a new member of
the rotation. Over his four starts, he’s
allowed 11 earned runs to score in 26
innings and has struck out 22 batters.
Offensively, the Panthers seem to be
hitting their stride, as they enter the
weekend averaging 7.4 runs per game
in their past 10 "contests — likely the
result of multiple hitters who seem to
be emerging from early—season slumps.
First baseman Eric Hess owns a five-
game hitting streak and is batting .421
in that time, while outfielder Stephen
Vranka has reached base safely in 13
consecutive games. outfielder Casey
Roche has scored six runs and driven
in another six himself in his past five
games. is j \
As a team, the _Panthers have raised

their batting average to .273 after it sat

in the low .20os earlier in the season.

Georgia Tech bats .286 as a unit and
is led by Thomas Smith, who has posted
a .920 on—base plus slugging percentage
in his 23 games this year. I -
