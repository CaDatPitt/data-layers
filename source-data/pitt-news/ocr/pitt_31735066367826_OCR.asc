Moderate prices and moderate‘ progress, but neverthe-
less progress, aptly describe the Student Government’s Book
Exchange, If one were to list the most valuable services

done by students for students this year, the list would be
-incomplete without, mentioning the Book Exchange.

If you can remember the ﬁrst week of September, then
"maybe you noticed the 173 books scattered over a few
tables in an obscure corner on the 8th ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
V-Each book was insured with a ten cent handling fee; each
had the owner’s desired» price written on it. One hundred
and three books were sold.

n Things picked up the next term. This time the Book
Exchange Committee secured ﬁve rooms on the third ﬂoor
the Student,Union; students submitted 625eused books
_ or sale and 334 of them were "purchased. » '
The moderate progress that the Student Book exchange
,made during the ﬁrst two terms of this year can be at-
‘tributed to two things —- the persistent work of the com-
;mittee, and their belief that student support would grow
,with understand of the service. It was a good thing —— it
;‘couldn’t miss.

This committee rates additional praise because they
have continued to devote time to this project. And work
always pays.

A They are not waiting till the Fall to start the book ex-
it-change — they are starting this term, collecting books
5:-from students now in order to build up a 'more complete
“stock for the Fall. ,

The University has recognized their efforts too and gave
them an ideally situated ofﬁce right beside the cafeteria.
,'This should be a great incentive to all undergraduates who
"have underestimated the chances of getting their used
{books sold. I
y In talking with students who sold their texts through
"_’.th_e Boo'k,Exchange inthe past, we found that they not only
2 receive moreﬁfor their books than they would have at the
"University’s Book Center, but in addition could buy books
I at a much cheaper price.

-future will depend on how well and how much the entire
‘undergraduate student body is willing to support them.
Knowing students, we doubt if their support in the
(future will be moderate.

One of this country’s most genuine freedoms is

that of the press. With .the‘exception of certain

worthwhile authors, who come then and again un-
der the Postmaster General’s discerning literary
‘eye, anyone can print almost anything he likes. I
like to try thinking this is a Good
Thing, but I’m never quite up to
it.

Considering ﬁrst the inﬂuence
of newspapers alone over the
millions who read them like
Scripture, then considering some
of the things that appear in
newspapers — even now I am
ready to take the torch to the
city’s' newsstands, just as a
starter. ' '

For example, I once chanced
upon one of Miss Dorothy Kilgallen’s more elevated
columns. Forsaking the world of glamorous divorce
and Fidel Castro’s imminent fall from power,
(every three months or so, this good lady absoluteiy
assures us one and all that The Bearded Rascal
shall topple within but a few days), the First Lady
of American Journalism betook herself to the opera
house. For a production of Verdi “Nabucco,” noless.
Having seen same, she pronounced it worthless.
Corruption in the Cathedral

Well and good. Who better to evaluate Verdi -
before the goggling eyes of thousands of believing
readers —- than Miss Kilgallen?

Ur again, closer to home: a few months ago, a
certain gentleman of the press assumed upon_him-
self the responsibilityof exposing to an outraged
(on cue) world the corroding treason" behind the
Gothic walls of the Cathedral.

Within days‘, conscientious readers, the Ameri-
can Legion,, the VFW and every other Yahoo or-
ganization under the sun were demanding stern
measures, but two or three shades gentler than
Expiation by Fire.

Little matter‘ than Dr. Colodny was ﬁnally ex-
honerated: traitor he remains. The fact that Dor-

othy Kilga1len’s musical perception would be in-'
competent to tell “Nabucco” from “Hearts and
Flowers,” the opera is roundly pronounced a
bad one.

Because after all, we hear the proverbial Gentle
Reader saying, it wouldn’t be in the newspaper if it

weren’t so.

'- Hurrah again. In addition to this line of over‘ '
whelming logic, Gentle Reader will say that the}
newspapers have the right to print what they‘

please. The newspapers themselves, under the

, management of singularily mod-est gentlemen will

even expand on this. It is their duty, and they ﬂing

- the world about like ideological confetti.

I should mention here, that in spite of my
vitriolic tongue and rolling eyes, I agree entirely

with these latter statements concerning Right and-

Duty. For one thing, I detest censorship, if only
because I’ve never heard of a censor bright enough
to pass an Alabama Literacy Test: and I am down-

right grateful when a newspaper takes upon itself
the responsibilities, say, of letting the public in on
the charlatanades of the world’s John Haluskas.

My Fight .

What is it then that has me all afroth? Am I
merely transmitting my chronic colic into print?

No, my complaint is directed against the inade-
quate, if not downright distorted, concept of free-
dom embraced by the newspapers. They one and all
forget that freedom owes its existence to responsi.
bility. Without it, freedom is little more than chaos.

But the crux of the matter is this: irresponsible
freedom is no freedom at all. No newspaper has
the right to be careless or dishonest. It has no duty
but to tell the truth, and that competently.

I am reminded here of an old slogan, unfor.
tunately the property and watchword of the WCTU
folk and other disgusting outgrowths of society, but
one not without some sense to it: “Liberty, not
” Take away those old ladies with hatchets,
and you have something with some wisdom in it.

In a (free society, a sense of self-responsibility
——-call it discretion if you will — is not too much
to ask for or even demand.

Catalogue Controversy

By Kathy Maser
Any student who opens The Pitt News with rel-
ish twice a week to ﬁnd even a subtle anti—admin-
istration innuendo on the editorial page will be dis-
appointed with this column. _
The venerable head of one of our departments,
when talking of Ina Amdur’s
column about the new cata-

smiled a patient slow smile.
“There are different kinds‘ of

To him, the catalogue repre-
sents a revolutionary effort at
making something academically
solid out of our curriculum. This
catalogue, he asserted, was not
meant for the senior but for the
sophomore and the freshman
entering in September. _ ,

Seniors and juniors, unfortunately, are-' victims
of what he termed “phrasing in,” a kind of transi-
tion between plateaus. We look and drool at courses
which are being offered perhaps for the ﬁrst time
and we check in the time schedule,for Fall tri-
mester and ﬁnd them not listed. Does this mean
that they will never be given? There is no evidence
for this. .

The Economic F-actor

' It would be economically impossible for a uni-
versity to function if every course listed were of-
fered every trimester. The curriculum has been
planned for at least the next four years; It is up
to the individual department, not the administra-
tion to see that they are given.

When I entered Pitt in 1957 there were juicy
courses which were listed as ‘Given in ’59-’60.’ -I
waited. They were given. M

Department heads perhaps were hard-pressed to
set up their curricula so far in advance, besides at-
tempting some much-needed revision in course of-
ferings.» But I am convinced that somehow these
departments will make these offerings good. Many
new department curricula represent a real ring-

ding vision of a dream of the educators who insti-

 

 

tuted there. (Maybe professors have dreams just
like students.

The new catalogue, many will admit, represents
a distinct improvement over the ones of past years.
By the time September’s freshmen become seniors
the)’ will have completed a much more intense,
more disciplined, and ‘more sophisticated academic
program than was offered to us. A

Because we have perhaps proﬁted less than they
by a “university in . . . transition,” (I almost said

revolution), Should we deny that what is proposed -
for them will not exist? It is a hard thing, really, .

to be glad that better things are being planned for

a whole new crop of students, who, we would like A

to think, are still very wet behind the ears. It is
easy to be angry that it wasn’t planned for us.
Course Cancellations

And if courses are cancelled, as does happen,

‘this only points up“ one very long—standing policy

of the University. Courses are held on a contingent
basis. Perhaps this rule is unfair. But if it were
Changed, I’ll bet my Tuck Shop coﬁee that it would
mean arise in tuition Do any of you want to pay,
533', twelve-thousand-dollar-a-year man to teach
ﬁve students? Multiply this many --times over and
you have a substantial sum. (Counselling courses
should not'be permitted in graduate divisions how-
ever).

. There is administrative dishonesty, perhaps. Ad-
ministrators may be caught in a cage of dualistic

attitudes toward academic life —— between what is A

academically perfect, and what is possible. They
face. problems which we as students don’t under-
stand, and we punish them, sometimes justly some-
times not» Simply because they are fallible. '

Administration: a big black creeping demon? It
wouldbe easy to think so. Maybe we understand

too much about its collective-noun connotation and ‘V

too little of the individuals themselves. As for me,
I ﬁnd it very hard to believe that administrators;
human beings after all, are deliberately perpetrat-
ing a hoax against students. I find it equally hard

to believe that a group of adult, educated men are:

deliberate liars. . .

Straight From
The
Horse's Mouth

By JACK SMITH

_ Executive Sports Editor 5
Over the past few years while writing sports for the
Pitt News I have received several letters from sports fans
who have had gripes about the Pitt’s football teams. All
of these gripes could fall into three general 5
categories that are as follows: Pitt is deem-

  

sen’s system of coaching is poor or Coach Mi-
chelosen is a poor coach.

Anyone who has seen the Panthers’
schedule this year or the tentative sched-
ules for the future, realizes that any talk of
Pitt deemphasizing football is nonsense.

Pitt enjoys the reputation of being one of
the nation’s top football teams on the basis of their schedule.
This year is no exception. With teams like Army, Navy, Notre

' Dame, California, UCLA, Syracuse, Penn State, West Virginia

and newcomers Baylor and Washington on the slate, the
Panthers are playing the best.

I wish I had three credits for every time I heard
someone saythat Michelosen’s teams “run up the middle”
too much. A careful study of any of the ﬁlms, of last
year’s games will show that the Panthers “ran up the
middle” far less than any other of their many and varied
plays. This misconception stems from the fact that many
people can’t distinguish different running plays through
the lines, .

Michelosen’s system of football is one that is used in
"the major football colleges across the country, among them
Georgia Tech and Alabama. The fault for poor teams, I

XE. ~ 

WINNER-LOSER respectively last week in the Faculty-Student
softball game at Forbes Field was Jack Smith, left, and Ron Pease.
Smith pitched ﬁve innings giving up no runs and only three hits.
Pease was tagged for 11 runs and 16 hits.

feel, lies more with the assistant coaches.

I A Pitt graduate, who now is a successful dentist in
.Oakland, says that Michelosen is like a professor who has
a subject he wants to teach. The professor tells his assistants
how he wants the subject taught. If the students don’t learn
the subject then much of the blame must fall on the assist-
ants who handle the classroom work.

Coach Michelosen has a system of football. It’s up

I

to the backﬁeld coach to see that the backﬁeld timing is

down pat. If the timing is continually poor it’s time to
get a new backﬁeld coach. With Bimbo Cecconi coaching

the backﬁeld this year along with Carl DePasqua, I

feel we will see an improvement in that teaching

department.

In all fairness to the coaches, injuries and inexperience
does play a big part in the performance of any team. And
whenever you have the human element with its attitudes
and quips you will have the unpredictable.

' As for John Michelosen being a poor coach, other coach-
es across the country think that he is one of the best. I am

inclined to agree with them.

for a 1-3 chart. His game on the
winning side of the ledged was a
no-hitter.

Batting-wise, Al Riccuitti, the
all sopohmore shortstop paced the
hitters with a .447 mark in 10
games, before he dropped out of
school for the spring.

John Cioffi paced the full-sea-
son regulars with a .340 percent-
age. Ray Barton, who saw limted
action, checked in at .333. The
poor fortunes of the Cats can be
readily alibied by the poor hit-
ting of Captain Jerry Matulevic
and 1960 .400 hitter, Pete Suder.

Suder dropped from .407 to .257,
and Matulevic, expected to re-
gain his 1959 form, hit at a .243
clip. The team hit .228. That
equals 4-9.

Schenley Six knocked Lambda Chi out of tournament

competition by a 10-6 count.

The Chem—E’s haven’t lost a.‘

game yet and appear to be a shoo-
in for the championship. From all
appearances the teams will ﬁnish
exactly as they did in the ﬁrst
half of the season with the Chem-
icals in first place.

The Chem-E’s defeated Psycho-
loggy for the second time but it
took some doing.

At one time in the game Psy-
chology led the Chemicals 8-2.
The Chemicals, however, ex-
ploded for six runs in the ﬁfth
and ﬁve in the sixth to pull out
the win.

With the game tied 8-8 in the
last of the sixth, Bob Beisel slam-
med a homerun to give the Chem-
icals the lead. Doubles by Jack
McCreary and Ray Birch, each
with two men on base, accounted
for the Chemicals remaining runs.

Perhaps the best play of the
season occurred in the sixth inn-
ing when Esper Deep, Chemicals,
attempted to score on a double by
Jude Foxall. The Psychology
catcher to"k the throw from his’
right fielder and waited for Deep.

Deep took a head-ﬁrst slide
into home, escaping the tag for

the score. Deep’s daring slide

‘Matthew Learns a Lesson

 

Small Play

‘BBBeally Big’ Success

By MATTHEW NESVISKY
The cast only numbered
three. The stage looked like
a 1949 model television screen.
And the drama never reached
its second hour.
But ‘the Pitt Players Work-

shop production of Eugene lones-
co’s comedy “THE LESSON” was
by no means a little play. It was,

V indeed, a rrreally big show.

The avant—garde satire con-
cerned itself with education, and
one simply has to count the
floors of the Cathedral to realize

' how big a subject learning is.
Big as the theme was, however,
it was presented in the smallest
scale possible.

The play’s single scene showed
the study of The Professor, a room
which was interestingly designed
to look both hungry and over-
stuffed.

Striking music, quite modern
and yet smacking of a tottering
traditionalism expertly set the
mood. Myra Gwillim’s original
score harmonized with the pattern
of the dialouge with an uncanny
accuracy.

The Maid, played by Rachael
Weingarten, was the first char-
acter to enter the stage. Look-
ing like part of the furnishings

of the study, as all maids should,
Miss Weingarten turned in a be-
lievable performance.

The girlish bundle-of-excite-
ment, The Pupil, appeared next.
She arrived (with the audience) to
receive her ﬁrst lesson from The
Professor. Judith Cohen milked
every last drop from The Pupil,
using every eye, lip and cheek that

‘she could beg, borrow or put on

with grease-paint.

Miss Cohen was dangerously
close to over-doing her important
role, but the fact that she looked
like a young girl and was clothed
in, soft gaity was a great help in

Big Brothers
Write Letters

‘(Continued from Page 1)

With freshmen week, however,
lies the real fun of being a Big
Brother. Following the Chancel-
lor’s annual address to the new
students on the ﬁrst day of Orien-
tation Week, the counselors will
meet informally" with their indivi-
dual groups.

In, between seminars, preceptor-
ials, dances and the fun-day at
Kiski, the counselors will hold
many meetings with their groups.

They will continue to keep in
touch with the new freshmen men
even after Orientation Week’s ter-
mination on Labor Day, helping
them with any problems that they
might encounter during their first
year at Pitt.

U .S. Awards
Biologist Grant

Dr. Richard C. Dugdale’s aquatic
plant research program recently‘
received a grant for $173,000 dol-
lars. _

The assistant professor in the
Department of Biological sciences
received the ﬁnancial support
through an $89,334 grant from the
U.S. Department of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, and an $83,-
700 grant from the Nati0I1a1 Sci-
ence Foundation. '

Conducting experiments in Ber-
muda and at Pymatun1ng.Lake,
Dr. Dugdale has been trying to
discover how water plants use
nitrogen.

Comes Out

keeping her out of the comic-book
of characters.

Rik Pierce owned the best
part in the play and knew it.
As a scene stealer, he commit-
ted grand larceny as he out-
shone his partners in the dra-
ma’s only scene. The Professor
was a complicated character,
with lots of room for good and
bad.

The Professor was a part for
hands and feet as well as for a
voice. Pierce’s hands were merely
wrists with a few dozen ﬁngers,
and his feet only shuffled with old
age as they should on rare oc-
casions.

Still, Pierce proved himself an
excellent comedian with a rare
sense of timing which made his
orations, double-takes, consterna-
tions and screaming arguments
highly laudable.

An ugliness, which is significant
of Ionesco, was prevalent in the
quickly-moving comic dialogue.
The Professor tried to educate The
Pupil. Ionesco says resoundingly
that he no longer knows the pur-
pose of education. The Pupil, not
knowing that she is supposed to
learn how to learn, is more con-
cerned with her lollypop, her rib-
bons and her burning bicuspid:
The audience had a hearty laugh
at her antics, but ﬁgured: “Gee, a
toothache is a toothache, after all.”

The Maid had an interesting
role in the non—education which
took place. She threatened The
Professor, slapped him around,
forgave him after reducing him
to the lowest of creatures, and

The comedy turned to chilling
tragedy when the old man predict-

tion will do it every time.

- The entire production, but par-
ticularly the death scene, came off
as don’t-miss entertainment. ' Di-
rector Greg Kopac had a big can-

than just what Wa.s in the spirit.
