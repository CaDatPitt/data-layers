in the Common Facilities Classroom Building to
discuss the idea of a “free university" and how to
improve the structure and communication within
this University. They scrupulously avoided inter-
fering with scheduled classes, but declared their
intention to remain in this building for as long as
three days and nights.

 

As I have repeatedly said. I regard free discus-
sion. debate._criticism and peaceful demonstrations
as natural and constructive activities in a universi-
ty. Last evening I met this group and reaffirmed
this view. I pointed out to them. however, that I
would expect them to leave the building at the nor-
mal closing hour and to resume the next day. if
they wished. I also suggested they might wish to
seek approval for and schedule teach-ins or other

such as the Student Union.

THE STUDENT UNION is, of course, an ap-
propriate place for such activities. and is often used
well into late hours for events ranging from seri-
ous academitc programs to social occasions.

However. I also informed the students that they
would not be permitted to occupy any classroom
building beyond normal hours without authoriza-
tion. To do so. in my view. would be to infringe
upon the order of the academic community and.
mplicitly, to threaten the rights of others—eventual-
y, if not immediately——to learn and to teach in a
free environment ofdiscourse. ’

Moreover, despite the good intentions and good
behavior of the group, one or two professors with
classes scheduled in this classroom building ap-
parently felt sufficiently apprehensive to cancel
heir classes. Also—and this was an imperative and
deep concern to me—occupatioh of buildings on
other large public campuses has produced escalat-
ng reactions among other student groups and the
serious threat of physical violence.

MY STATEMENT TO the students was made
early in the evening. Later it was reaffirmed by the
Assistant Chancellor for Student Affairs. Still later.
t was announced that the building was officially
closed. Soon after, the Dean of Students again urged
hegroup to leave. He informed them that if they
did not leave they would be subject to disciplinary
action and that an injunction was being sought re-
quiring them to vacate the building. They were in-
ormed that they could use the ballroom of the Stu-
dent Union to carry on their discussions if they
wished.

A five day restraining order was served at 4:30
a.m. and all members of the group vacated the
building peacefully. ‘

I deeply regret that this action was necessary.
This University has a proper framework for free
and open discussion and it is our intention to use it
and expand it. Constructive dialogue is essential to
he University. but it must be carried on in an at-
mosphere free of force and intimidation. in which
he rights of all are protected and the views of all

 

  
  

  

  
   
 

    
  

  

discussion meetings in a more suitable facility.’

By VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

A meeting of 100 students in the ~

Commons Room at noon yester-
day swelled into a marathon
teach-in of more than 900 in the
Common Facilities (CF) Build-
ing. The meeting broke up when
an injunction was served at 4:30
a.m. against the remaining 300
participants.

The teach-in was touched off by
the refusal of Thomas Rea. chair-
man of the University Board of
Trustees. to hold an open meeting
with the students and faculty to
discuss grievances and propose a
change in the selection of Board
members. i

Dr. David Houston. Economics.
claimed in the Commons Room
that “dialogue" is pretty well
strung out now. In the face of rea-

sonable requests. we have only‘.

received a no. We have been con-
fronted with power »and force
and we must respond with power
and force."

The initial group of 100 left
the Commons .Room and headed
for CF with plans to fast for three
days and. occupy the building.
Their wish was to break up into
smaller groups after the CF clos-
ed at 10 p.m. to conduct discus-
sion groups on such issues as the
role and functions of the Univer-

sity, curriculum and nonviolence. /

As the day progressed. the
ranks of those present began to
grow. The participants numbered
about 450 when an informal re-
quest to leave the building at the
closing time came from Dr. Jack
Critchfield, Vice-Chancellor in
charge of Student Affairs. at 5
o’clock.

_ He pointedout the danger that
the news media may emotionalize
the teach-in and incur public
wrath and fear. He also warned
that a cutback of. state funds. for

the University could result from.

public indignation.

Chancellor Posvar made an ap-
pearance at 6:30 p.m. and reiter-
ated Critchfield’s request. “I’m
concerned that what may start
out as a teach-in may lead to the
seizure of an instructional facil-
ity,” he said. He urged his more
than 900 listeners to “consider
repeating your dialogue tomorrow
in a suitable time and place.”

Josh Chasen. teaching fellow in

the History department. declared-

in response that “we must explain
to Harrisburg the difference be-
tween fire-bombing and a peace-

' ful demonstration.-” The partici-

pants then resigned themselves
to stay in CF.

Brainstorming  

The "fear that the police would
appear to enforce the 10 o’clock
closing time of CF triggered a de-
bate among the students and fac-
ulty concerning whether to leave
the building at that time and move
to another location such as the
Towers, which remain open the
entire night. or to stay and risk
forceable arrest.

The dissension among the par-
ticipants in the teach-in escalated
when Critchfield reappeared lat-
er in the evening to offer the SU
Ballroom for Wednesday in place
of CF which he insisted would be
locked at 10 p.m.

“The SU is the normal location
in which such meetings should
be conducted," the administra-
tor affirmed. “There is no good
reason to keep the CF" open and no
good reason to break tradition.
You are asking for a special priv-
ilege.” ‘

Joe Kociubes, V CAS Cabinet
chairman. offered the argument
that the CF is a superior place for
the teach-in because of the ready
accessibility of classrooms, for
small group discussion. He also
added that thus far no corridors
had been‘ blocked by those pres-
ent and no University functions
had as yet been interferred with
by the demonstrators.

On the other side of the fence,
Ken Schueler, past SG president,

was convinced that “it is not the »

purpose of the teach-in to build
confrontation with the adminis-
tration or the police. It is some-
thing to move beyond tactics to
make students more aware of the
problems and to. propose real
alternatives.”

Before talking out, "Schueler
predicted that the confrontation
may harm future attempts at
University reform.

Two factions emerged; Those
who intended to st_ay in the CF af-
ter the arrival of the police and be
nonviolent and those who planned
to leave the building.

‘ Vic P_apale, Senior, counseled
that it was better to act as a unit
to “avoid ‘alienating the rest of
the University and to keep bureau-
cratic channels open to us.”

The factionalization became
more acute whe"r'1 Jack Freeman,
secretary of the University, of-
fered another alternative. “It
is expected that the CF will be
vacated at 11 p.m. The SU Ball-
room is available immediately

for this group to‘r:ont.in_ue__its.vig- .

il there tonight.” he said.

I This proposal was debated with-
out resolution for more than an
hour and a half. It was tempor-

arily interrupted at 11 p.m. when
the acting chief of the campus
police entered the building and an-

“nounced that CF was now closed.

The students did not comply
with the request to vacate,=how-
ever, and it was soon‘ apparent
that the majority of those present
were in favor of leaving CF for the
SU when the the expected arrival
of the County Sheriff took place.

‘A substantial minority voiced an-

intention to stay in the building
and invite arrest.

Ronald Pease. Dean of Stu-
dents. showed up about 11:30
and read a formal statement.
“This is to advise you that your
conduct is in violation of the reg-
ulations of this University. No
action will ._be "taken against those
of you who leave immediately.
Those who remain will be liable
to the University’s disciplinary
action. Faculty. too. by Faculty
Boards. Also, those who do not
leave will be subject to legal rem
edies,“ he read. I

Pease then left the building to
undertake‘ injunction proceed-
ings against those who were il-
legally occupying the building.

The administrative ultimatum

did not serve to unify-the occupi-‘

ers of. the  A sizable number of
students and faculty still intend-
ed to stay): in the building for the
three-day vigil. In an effort to gain
consolidation, those bent on risk-‘
ing arrestijretired into room 107

of view to talk, it out.

An hour, debate resulted in a
pragmaticagreement on the part
of the minority to leave the build-
ing upon the arrival of the Deputy
Sheriff if they all would reconvene
the next morning in CF and con-
tinue the teach-in.

The following three hours con-
sisted of individual group sessions
for discussion and a long period
of waiting, smoking or sleeping.

The ‘coming of the Deputy Sher-
iff, Saul Ackerman, provided the
lightest moments of the 16-hour
teach-in. He arrived at 4:30 a.m.
and foundgfa diminished group of
sleepy students and faculty. His
joke thatglhe “came there as a
new professor” was greeted with
laughter and a comment that,
“He got liere in time to close
the building‘ before it opened for
classes..” .

After the injunction was serv-
ed. the participants disbanded.

§Phofos by
5 Moss Aubrey
and P%%LHornstie

A group of concerned students and faculty be-
gan to create the idea and the reality of an open
and independent university yesterday. Congregat-
ing in the Common Facilities Building, and using
only those classrooms that were vacant (and care-
fully avoiding. any disruption of any classes or ac-
tivities), they began to elaborate upon their notions
of specific Ways the University could be changed
and the general context in which that change must

come about.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

That context was quite clear: more than 50 of
the participants began on Tuesday at noon a three
day fast. which would provide a focal point for
three days of discussion in the Common Facilities
Building. The context was clearly one of a nonvio-
lent but nonetheless militant character.

‘The students and faculty acted unbelievably
reasonable——the administration’s response was irra-
tional, without logic and with little moral validity.
First the Administration asked the group to leave.
Then it suggested that it move to the Student Un-
ion for the following night; then the Student Union

for Tuesday night. Some of the students came up.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

with a counter proposal that they leave, go to the
Union when and if the University called the po-
lice, and that the University then agree to the con-
tinuation of the fast and free university for the next
two days and nights.

The Administration's final response:

 
 
 
    
 

at 4:30‘

 

a.m. or so—the sherif.

Reacting with reason andwith a desire to cre-
ate some credibility of sincerity. the Students and
Faculty decided to leave without being arrested.

T Today the whole _thing may be repeated. This is
because some students and faculty believe that
what was going on in Common Facilities on Tues-
day afternoon and night was beautiful and con-
structive. People began to talk to each other about
what they were doing: their roles in the University.

  
   
      
 
 
 
    
 

That's what this place is all about. The burden of
irrationality, illogic and childishness rests upon
the Administration. 1

ise Decision

A very wise decision was made early this morning in room
107 of the Common Facilities Building. ~

After much discussion, the leaders and some members of
the Concerned Students and Faculty decided not to stay after
the police came, but to move the Free University to the SU Ball-
room for the remainder of the night, and resume activities in
the CF building in the morning. ;

A point which was-stressed throughout the discussion, and
agreed upon at the end, was that the group will remain in the
CF building tonight to complete the three-day fast and Free
University. ~ -

This ‘decision was wise in that it considered the majority

of not only previously concerned, and committed, students,_but

‘ also those who were witnessing a free and opened discussion of
University problems for the first time.

Those in the room hoped that by avoiding a direct confron-
tation with the police and in turn avoiding arrest and possible
expulsion, they wouldbe able to discuss the current problems
with the other students, and gain more support (through num-
bers) for a possible confrontation in the future. -

This wise decision followed two rather unwise decisions
made earlier in the evening.

The first, was the decision of the administrationto open the__.,
Studeiit Union, but not permit the CF building to be opened.
during the night. Much of the hassle and discussion that inter- _
rupted the previously scheduled meetings of the Free Universi-
ty could have been avoided had the administration allowed the
movement to continue in the CF building. A

The second, was the gut reaction of many of the students
to the first decision. Had the group moved to the_SU, much
of the dialogue that occurred for the rest of the evening could
have been directed toward problems here, rather than toward
what was going to be done when the cops came to kick every-
one out of the building. In the long run many students (and
hopefully faculty and administrators) learned something from
what happened yesterday.

 

But, yesterday was. only a beginning. For those of you who
were there, The Pitt News‘-urges that you attend again today
and tomorrow—-and anytime a group congregates to discuss prob-
lems at the University. -

For those of you that missed what happened yesterday,
please attend the meetings in~the next few days and learn some-
§ thing about what is happening around you. It is your responsi-
bility. It’s your University. '

Dentists, Engineers Kickoff Events

The annual Engineer’s Week began Monday
with a marathon pancake dinner. The dental stu-
dents also are sponsoring an annual event, the
Student American Dental Association Day which
began with registration today in the Dental School.

A major concern of this year's Engineers‘ Week
(March 10-14) is money—money for the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind. Engineers will
devote much of their week to fund-raising projects.
one of which is a marathon pancake dinner. _.

The Industrial Engineering Department will
sponsor the dinner at the Bellefield Presbyterian
Church from 7 a.m. to about 1 .m. on Monday
through Thursday. and from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. on
Thursday.

A donation of $1 will cover “all the pancakes
you can eat,” sausage, coffee, orange drink.

Today the University’s Student American Den-
tal Association is sponsoring its annual “Student
ADA Day Program. Included in the morning’s
schedule were registration of studentsand guests
and free peridontal examinations and panorex
(x-ray). There were also tours of the Dental Clin-
ics offered to all.

The Dental Association will continue its pro-
gram this evening with cocktails. a dinner ‘banquet
open to non-participants of Student ADA Day for
$5, and a presentation of awards at 8:30 p.m. The
main speaker at the presentation of awards will
be Dean Edward J. Forrest.

Turns Tables on Navy;

High Scoring Diver Wessel  
Primed For Eastern Rivals

By MARTIN HELLMAN
In his first year of varsity competition for the swimming
team, sophomore Dave Wessel compiled an impressive record.
Not only did he lead the squad in scoring over the season, but he also
broke the Trees Pool records in both the one meter and three meter

Dave Young had just won the 190-pound championship in
the Navy Plebe tournament, and as he walked over to chat with
the Navy coach, he felt pretty good inside. .

You see, David had just handed Navy’s undefeated Jim Giambas-
tiani his first defeat in ten matches, 15-9. And earlier in the tourna-
ment he had pinned another Navy opponent. The funny thing is that

Dave Young almost wrestled for
the Naval Academy.

“I had an appointment to the
Academy,” Young explained, “and
I was planning on going there.
Then coach (Dave) Adams got in
touch with me and I came into
Pittsburgh for a weekend. I didn’t
like the city that much, but coach
Adams is a great coach, the pro-
gram looked good and it’s a good
school.” That’s when Dave
changed his mind and came to
wrestle for Adams, an ex-Navy as-
sistant.

Young went undefeated in the
tournament, pinning his first two
opponents. -He rates Giambastiani
as the best he’s faced thus far in

. his college career. “I was so

psyched going into that match with
the Navy kid. It was unreal. I told
myself,” he paused, “I got to kill
that kid.”

“After the match, I went up to
the Navy coach and I loved every
minute of it,” he continued.

Kill above paragraph

“After the match, I went up to
the Navy coach and I loved every
minute of it,” he continued.

With the Plebe tourney marking
the end of the frosh wrestling sea-
son, Dave has his sights set on next

» year with varsity and he indicated

he‘d probably be wrestling at 190,
although he, has seen some action
at heavyweight this season. “The
boys get too big for me at heavy-
weight. At 190, the kids are my
size and I’m assured of my strength
against them.

“I’d like to place in the Eas-
terns next year,” he continued,
“but first I’ll have to make the.
team.”

In addition to wrestling, Young
is also a member of the football
team, which begins spring drills
March 28. With the year - round
schedule of athletics he finds it a
little hard to find study time. Dave
is currently in the school of en-
gineering.

“I’m here on a wrestling scholar
ship,” Dave explains. “but I enjoy
both sports. I don’t have to play
football, but once you get it in
your blood, you can’t give it up.
I’d never quit a sport; it’s to
much fun.” —

Young’s looking forward to the
football season and plans on play-
ing defense, where he played as

plained; “I_like to crack heads.”

Dave’ll get his chance to do just
that in the next three years.

Free Agent

Although he does not have a full-
time diving coach, Dave consid-

I ers his training here the best in

his career. “Bill Brown, an ex-di-
ver for Pitt has helped me im-
mensely this past year,” he said.

According to team coach Bill
Grant, “Dave’s mark of 280 points
inthe three meter dive puts him
in the class with the top divers in
the nation.”

Alois Eyes Pro Future

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

The Monday after the Jan-
uary 28 Pro-Football Draft,
senior gridder Art Alois re-
ceived an important telephone
call. Philadelphia Eagles head
football coach Joe Kuharich was
on the other end of the line.

“It was one of the first big de-
cisions I ever; had to make on my
own,” said Alois. “Football is a
hard thing to get out of your sys-
tem.”

Alois had to choose between
football and dental school. In
signing on with the Eagles, the
220-pound guard hopes to tackle
both fields.

‘.‘If I canhmake the’Eagles
and get cash,” said Alois looking
into the future, “then I’ll have
enough money to come back to
school.”

Alois is tentatively scheduled to
report to the Eagles’ summer
camp at Albright College dur-
ing July. His new coach will be
watching him at three positions.

“I think they want me to, play
guard,” said Alois. “They had a
high mortality rate down there
in Philly. But I also have shots at
center and at linebacker where I
played in my sophomore year.”

Kuharich might give his
free agent every possible oppor-
tunity to hook on with the Eagles
for sentamental reasons in addi-
tion to Alois’ football skills. The
Eagles’ head coach was the head
coach over Alois’ father at the
University of San Francisco.

But when it comes down to
earning a place on the roster,
Alois will have to bank solely on
his ability.

“I’d really like to try.” said
Alois. “I’ll be in a much different
position than Flanny (Jim Flan-
nigan). He had to push out a guy
named Ray Nitzche. The Eagles’
guard has only played there a
year, and their center is only a
first or second year man.”

“I don’t want to lose sight of
dent school,” said Alois. He
hopes to continue his schooling
whether he makes it as a pro
or not. '

Even though Dave hoped to at-
tain this level this year, "he ad-
mits that his improvement during

-the season surprised him. “I

wanted to bring my total in the
high board to around 280 points
by the end of the season, but hon-
estly never expected to come
close to it.”

Before coming here, Dave
starred for nearby Churchill Val-
ley High School. Being unable to
win the WPIAL diving champion-

ship, he never got to compete in

the state competition.

“Ialways finished ‘second to a
boy who went on to win the state

. crown,” he commented. “I gave

him a tough battle, but he always
managed to come through and beat

7)

me.

This weekend Dave will try his
luck at New Haven, Conn., com-
peting in the Eastern Regional
Swimming Championships at Yale.
He realizes that he will probably
face stiff competition. ‘

“I haven’t seen many of the di-
vers yet,” he explained, “but I’m
sure that there will be many good
ones. The Ivy League always has
many excellent divers. I just hope
that I’ll be able to sneak into one
of the top six positions.”

 

Because of a conflict with fi-
nal exams, Dave has decided to
skip the National diving cham-
pionships this year. “Right now,
I feel it is very important to just
do well in the Easterns and make
myself known in the top diving
circles,” he said.

Dave feels that it would be ex-
tremely hard to do well in na-
tional meets now because he is
not known as a good diver. “Judg-
es usually allow a “name” diver
to make mistakes without de-
ducting too many points,” he ex-
plained.

The best divers in the country
now are reaching approximate-
ly 325 point totals in the three me-
ter dive.
