 Cites Problem

 Of No Quorum

Chuck Isler, president of

c_ ' Student Government,

that it is not student apathy
 -that is keeping activities to a
minimum this .trimester. It is
simply the lack of students.
Most of the other student ac-
tivity groups support Isler in this
opinion. Attendance has fallen off
considerably from the two -pre'-

 . I‘ _viousVtrimesters, and most organi-
zations attribute this to the de-
crease in students attending "the

third trimester.

In support of this view Isler

, had this to say. "Most of the peo-
ii. ’ple that are going to school this
 _V trimester are those who are trying
3-‘ V to get through in a hurry.'They
‘ ' are working, and simply don’t

Administered by the American

Association of Medical Colleges,

 the SK&F Foreign Fello-wships

represent a unique chapter in
American medical education. They
are supported by a $180,000 grant
from Smith Kline & French Lab-
oratories, a Philadelphia pharma-
ceutical firm.

During the three years of the
planned program, about 90
selected students will receive
ﬁnancial grants to permit them
to spend up to 12 weeks study-
ing in remote areas of their
choice;

Askin is one _of 28 American
medicalstudents to study under
this new program.

Programs Organized

Working with physicians already
practicing in these areas, the Fel-
lows will help to organize and
maintain public health programs,
and will gain valuable clinical ex-
perience.

In addition, the Fellows will
serve as goodwill ambassadors,
representing American medical
schools and bringing the latest
medical techniques and pro-
cedures to these areas.

Literature Taught
 ;One feature of the program "is

' course covering three programs of

Another feature of the program
‘ is the" French class, which uses a
laboratory to aid the teacher in
giving individual atention to stu-
'. dents. Each student can be heard
‘separately over a radio system
whereby the master box is con-
trolled by the teacher.
Developing Curiosity

designed to provide rewarding in-
individual experiences for each stu-
‘-"dent. , *

In-addition to these new courses,
the Center is experimenting- with a
“part-time Pitt” program. Some
students from Schenley are taking
courses in psychology, anthropo-
logy, ,English, mathematics, core
curriculum and economics at the
University, while in their last year
of high school. .

Some other students will skip
their entire senior year and be
admitted to the University in
advance. .

The CEC evolved out _of the Re-
gional Commission on Educational
Coordination, which is , composed
of educators in Ohio, West Vir-
ginia, and western Pennsylvania.

Dr. Kolbert said that a tre-

study in the department has re-
sulted from the large number of
teaching fellowships, research
assistantships, graduate assist-_
antships, tuition fellowships and
Andrew Mellon Awards that
have been granted.

“We will have graduate stu-

stitutions in the world,” Kolbert
said. He cited some of the uni-
versities—Paris, Dartmouth, Ma-
drid, Bryn Mawr, and Vassar.

Dr. Kolbert added that with the
exception of the elementary
courses, the book, the number, the
material, and the method for
courses has been revised.

Classics Department Chairman

Returns‘ From Tour Overseas

Dr. Arthur Young, head of the Classics Department of
the University, has just" returned from a two month tour of
several countriesin Europe and North Africa, on which he
was accompanied by seven students from the Pittsburgh

The travellers paid all their own expenses, which totaled

about $1500 each. They lived and
traveled as economically as pos-
sible. In order to do this, they
stayed at small local hotels, lived

on the scale of the natives,. used
the common transportation of the
country, and avoided the tourist
traps. - -

The itinerary of the tour in-
cluded Paris, Milan, Rome, Flor-
ence, Athens, Rhodes, Crete,
Cairo, and several other points.

Friends Made

Economy was a keynote of the
tour, and making the trip in this
way allowed the tourists contact
with the people of the countries
which they were visiting. By liv-
ing with the natives ‘and speaking
their language the travelers made
many friends. ' ’

On the evening before their
departure from Florence they
returned to their hotel to ﬁnd
that a farewell party had been
organized for them, complete
with champagne.

In Cairo, the owner of the hotel
at which they stayed, an old
friend of Dr. Young’s, personally
accompanied them to the bazaar
to guide them through the maze
of narrow streets and advise them
as to the best places ‘to shop for
particular things.

Spread Good Will

In all the countries which they
visited, the people found them
very different from the Ameri-
cans that they saw in movies. “For
eight people,” said Dr. Young, “we
spread quite a bit of good will for
America.” '

The group visited museums,
historic sites, and various points
of interest. Although they did
not have as much time as they
would have liked in some places,

Dr. Young said that on the

whole, the trip was very satis-
factory.

“Each place seemed better than
the previous place,” he‘ said.
“Everything went according to
plan, and nothing happened to
spoil any part of the trip.”

He told of several moments of
