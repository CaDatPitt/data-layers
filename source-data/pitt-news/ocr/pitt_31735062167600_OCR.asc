There are times to be silent
and times to speak. The accumula-

this a time to speak out against
it in clearest terms. The costs
are not in men and material
alone. There are costs too in the
effects on young people’s hopes
and behiefs. The vast majority
of the students with whom we
work still want to believe in a
just, honest and sensitive Ameri-

ca. But they see our military
role in Vietnam as a denial of so
much that is best in our society.

More and more, we see the war
deflecting energies and resour-
ces from urgent business on our
own doorsteps. And end to the

The moratorium march on Oc-
tober 15, proved to be one of the
' largest’ non-violent demonstra-
' tions ever to take place in Pitts-
’ burgh. Organizers stated that
_ the tremendous amount of control
, and restraint used to make this
-. , march a success was commend-
Sable. Theyalso remarked that

"all sides of the demonstration
,. * showed a tremendous amount of
 .. cool in making this day the
j. great event that it was.

_ As the march progressed through

Oakland, several incidents occur-
ed that threw a very unfavor-
able light on the fantastic job
the Pittsburgh Police Force did
in handling the march.

I.,- At the corner of Fifth Ave.
_,and Robinson St., a unit of the
Pittsburgh‘Police was parked on
the opposite side of the street of
"the march. One Pitt News Photo-
_ grapher stopped to take a human
{interest photograph of a very
"young police officer. As he stood
«- waiting to get a good shot, an
officer approached him and said,
..,."5I don’t take very good pictures,
fI_don’t want my picture taken.”

 A group of officers, many who
I had removed their badges and other
_ means of identification surround-
ed the student. “I’d‘ like the
' -film,” one officer said. The photo-
2 grapher told the officer that he
‘ would not print the pictures
:and offered to give him a writ-
-ten guarantee and the negatives
f when theywere processed. An-
{other officer asked if he worked
for the news, and the boy im-
v.mediate1y produced his press
jfcard. The officer took the card
and didn't return it.
 “‘I don’t want to get rough, but
" give me -the film or I’ll smash
ffyour camera-. One officer, who had
i been quiet to this point, re-

imarked, “Boy, you’re a hairy-

’,-mother F————er,”— and tore at
the photographers moustache.

" P Fearing further harrassment, the
(student _« surrendered his film to
 group of policemen and moved
 on;

During this incident, a large
group of marchers had begun to
gather, and the marshals tried
to keep it moving fearing fur-
ther violence. One_ marshall was
urging the crowd to move on, and
an officer turned to him and said,
“You move on too fat ass.”

An unknown photographer who
had taken pictures of the con-
frontation was also asked to sur-
render his film, but refused. The
officers grabbed him by the hair,
shaking his head violently, and
hustled him quickly across the
street and into a paddy wagon.

As the march continued by,"

the officers continued this un-
provoked harrassment, calling
the marchers names too crude to
reproduce here. Several officers

the police rushed across the street
and demanded his film. The ques-
tion “Why,” brought the reply,
“Because you can’t take a_ pic-
ture of a person without his per-
mission.”

Not wanting to provoke the po-
lice any more than he had to, the
student promptly handed over his
film.

In an interview with Inspec-
tor William Moore of the Num-
ber Two Police Station, it was
found out that all officers
must wear their badge, with an
identifying number, and a name
plate on their uniforms at all
times. Inspector Moore expressed
his very deep concern that this in-
cident had happened, but it was
not within his jurisdiction to in-

~ vestigate what had happened.

Many eyewitnesses commented
on the presence of the Tactical

‘Police Force and attributed the
incidents to this cause.

Open Trustee
Meetings

Sought Again

A group of concerned students
and faculty, about forty in num-
ber, was refused admittance in-
to the formal meeting of the
Board of Trustees yesterday af-
ternoon.

After occupying the thirty-
sixth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning without recognition,
the group went to the Chancel-

.lor’s Suite in Bruce Hall hoping

to meet with a number of trus-
tees equal to a quorum.

When the meeting of the
Board of Trustees ended the trus-
tees failed to appear informally
at, the Chancellor’s Suite, the
group headed for the Chancellor's
Office.

The group entered the Chan-
cellor’s Office with the intentions
of (1) setting a date, sometime
with two weeks, for an open meet-
ing of the Executive Committee;
(2) obtaining a statement of con-
tracts the University has with
the armed forces and industry;
(3) access to the minutes of in-

vestment policies over the last

five years. The group wanted the

above made publishable to the
Pitt News.

Head of the Board of Trustees
William Ray, Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar, and Vice-Chancel-
lor Edison Montgomery met
with the group. Thirty-three of
the thirty-four trustees were not
present because they went home,
according to Ray.

The group of concerned stu-

dents and faculty found them-
selves continually compromis-
ing on their objectives. The
discussion changed directions from
a meeting held opento the Uni-
versity with the Executive Com-
mittee to a meeting held open
to the University with ten trus-
tees; to a meeting held open to
as many members of the Univer-
sity that can be seated within
Room 120 in the Commons Fac-
ility Building, with three or
four trustees.

The meeting will be held Oc-
tover 29 at 7:00 p.m. Chancel-
lor Posvar and ex-Student Gov-
ernment President Ken Schuel-
er will co-moderate the meet-

Students Claim Police Harassment, Arrests

by ANNE DORN
Staff News Writer

Two veterans of the Mora-
torium March spoke with The
Pitt News Wednesday night.
Both limped into the office'— both
had a variety of stories to tell,
but for lack of space limits re-
telling all of them. For the sake of
convenience, their names will be
Bill and Dave. Neither student
wished his name to be printed
for fear of reprisals.

 

Bill related this experience
with a tactical policeman: He
and another student were park-
ed with their motorcycles in a
zone that has already been ap-
proved to them by a- city police-
man. Bill was trying to repair his
cycle when a tractical policeman
approached him and stated that
only one vehicle was permitted
to park there. He said that he
would leave when a second police-
man from the tactical force came
over and informed the others that
neither cycles could be parked
there. The other students prepar-
ed to leave, and Bill bent over to
try to fix his cycle onece more
before leaving.

The following conversation be-
tween the policeman and Bill
took place:

“Get the hell out of here!"

“Just a minute, I'm trying to
fix my bike first.”

“Don’t get smart with me."

Bill stated that the policeman
then hit him on the back of his
knee while he was bending over
and ordered him to “get out of
here.” As he mounted his cycle,
the policeman noticed a chain
Bill had wrapped around his
waist and grabbed him bv it.

“Just a minute, buddy. What’s
this?”

“I use to lock up my cycle.”

“long, isn’t it?”

‘‘I double it
wheel and lock it.”

“You’d better‘ not let me catch
you in the park with that on you
tonight.”

At this point, the other student
asked why.

Replied the policeman: “Cause
I’ll blow his F88ing brains out if
Ido.”

Dave served as a marshal. and
he witnessed several incidents
also around the bridge area. In
one instance. he himself was
“stomped on the foot purposely”
by a tactical policeman.

He told of‘ another time when he
was a marshal on the bridge and
escorting groups of people over.
“Three times in a row, when the
first few people of a group had
crossed the bridge onto the park
side, the same tactical cop grab-
bed me and said, ‘If you don’t
have people cleared on the bridge
are, we're going in with clubs to
clear it.’

Later, the anti-moratorium pro-
tesors formed three lines across
the park side of the bridge and
blocked it up. The cops didn’t
do anything to move them.”

Other incidents involving po-
lice and University/community
members occurred during the even
ing. Dr. David Houston, profes-
sor of economics, and Burton
Ascheim, of the Pittsburgh Point,
were arrested Wednesday after
the march.

Houston and Ascheim were sit-
ting on a curb waiting for a bus
at the corner of Fifth and Wood
downtown when they were pick-
ed up. An unidentified girl stand-
ing nearby was also arrested. As
the story allegedly goes, the girl
was thrown into the wagon, and
Houston, reaching out his hand to
help her, was punched by a police-
man. He was also reportedly mis-
handled at the police station.

While all this was going on, a
law student from the University,
Sam Vitaro, was across the street
and saw the incident. When he
went over, reportedly to help
the three arrested persons, he
was also taken into custody.

Houston was charged with dis-
orderly conduct and assault on
an officer. Aschiem and Vitaro
were both charged with disorder-
ly conduct.

Ascheim and Vitaro were releas-
ed on a $50 forfeit bond, awaiting
hearing. Houston was arraigned
Wednesday night and held on $5,
000 bond, with a hearing to be
scheduled later.

I was very depressed tonight at Point State Park.
I saw a lot of people using symbols against each
other that in a ‘different time or a different age
could have sat down and talked.

But the atmosphere was not right, the issues
were misunderstood. Schizophrenia was in the air
and people’s minds, hearts and philosophies were
colliding like incompatible molecules.

A sense of drama prevailed, a drama that
brought up painful associations from the past.
Groups of marchers alligned themselves, at the prod-
ding of the marshalls, at the bridge which led into
the Park, to make the great “break into freedom.” I
kept thinking about Hungarian freedom Fighters t00k Off.
and the Berlin Wall.

The bridge was not strewn with barbed wire
and tactile explosives, but with groups, howling
anti—Moratorium slogans, and impassive police. Some-
day, one may want to write a philosophical treat-
ise on the function of the police on that bridge.

I Perhaps they were there to protect the small
number of dissenters or to prevent them from at-
tacking the marchers. But their mute immobility
could be taken as a silent affirmation of the senti-
ments of the “real Americans” standing uneasily
behind them.

As the marchers passed without harm across the
bridge, they were greeted as long-lost brothers by
great numbers of their fellows, as if they had pas-

ever, was noticed after the
march was over. Two marchers
stopped in a pizza store for some
belated dinner. A college-aged
counter boy asked‘ them just what
they had solved by walking
around Pittsburgh all evening.

Ironically, it was the owner of
the store who provided the an-
swer. “I have two boys of my
own in Vietnam, and I’m glad
someone’s doing something about
getting this war ended. I want my
boys home again.

of Appeasement ,

The consequences of these concessions are clear:
(:1) While we have made major concessions, Hanoi
has not buged an inch, (2) The bombing halt has
enabled Hanoi to repair all major targets bombed *
out by our raids of past years, (3) The negotiations
in Paris are being used by the enemy as’a devise
to exhaust American patience and staying power

‘The~anti-war forcesare now massing for the
filan concession — a bugout. Both the “Vietnam Mora-
torium” and the bill introduced by Senator Goodell
are attempts ‘to undercut the administration's
bargaining position in Paris. Apparently since grad-
ual concessions have failed, we’ll just have to turn
the whole country over lock, stock, and barrel to
the Communists.

One would hope that the American people and
the Administration are able to defeat this latest at-
tempt to sell the South Vietnames people down
the river. One would also hope that given the fail-

The Moratorium

Memorial crosses were sym-
bolically planted on the Cathe-
dral lawn by students. Students
Tom lee played appropriate mus-
ic on his flute as the names of the
137 Allegheny County War Dead
were read by Rev. Robert Whit-
croft.

The second part of the Mora-
torium continued on the lawn
with Student. Christine Hill.
reading replies to letters sent out
to state and local politicans ask-
ing for their support of the de-
monstrations. Replies ranged
from ones given full support
and sympathy to the movement to
others lightly condemning the
entire idea of the Moratorium.

Merle Polis. popular newscas-
ter for radio station WJAS and
outspoken critic of the war in
Vietnam, was the kickoff speaker
for what student organizers of the
Moratorium termed a Teach-in.
Students then lowered the flag
to half mast in a traditional tri-
bute to honor Allegheny Coun-
ties War Dead.

Giving the black view and re-
sponse to the war was Cecil
Birt, representative from the
Black Action Society. He had no
sooner left the poeium, when an
unidentified University police-

‘ man, amid the boos and hisses of

the crowd, began to raise the flag
to full mast. After arguing with
student and faculty coordina-
tors for minutes, the campus pol-
iceman left the scene, the flag
remaining at full mast.

Professor Samual Hayes, then
explained to the crowd that of-
ficial permission had been ob-
tained to bring the flag down to
half mast, and that the Campus
Police Department just had not
been informed. So the flag
was again lowered to half mast.
Josh Chasen in a brief statement
cautioned the audience against
animosity towards the lone cam-
pus policeman who had raised the
flag again; saying that he (the
policeman) wasn’t the real pig,
and that he was just following or-
ders to keep his job.

The next speaker for the Teach-

In was Professor Hayes who during

the course of his speech vehement-
ly equivocated the ending of‘ the

war in Vietnam with the Mets

winning the major league pen-
nant.

Rall/y Speaker

(Continued from Page 1)

The young female folksinger
was interrupted in her enter-
tainment portion of the program
by a large group of high school
students. who had walked all the
way from Taylor Allderdice High
School in the City‘s Squirrel Hill
section. to take part in the Mora-
torium. They were greeted with a
resounding cheer from the stu-
dents already gathered on the
lawn.

A surprise speaker, Frank Smit-
tle, a Vietnam veteran and free
lance writer, told the gathering
that to go out and kill was a sick-
ening thing, but that the U.S.
could not withdraw from Viet-
nam because the enemy were ani-
mals. He also stated that com-
munist countries were ‘the main

monetary supporters of demonstra-

tions like the Moratorium. His
talk was not received too favor-
ablv by the gathering as evidenc-

 

ed  the jeers and boos as he left
the podium.

Presenting the answer to Mr.
Smittle was Kevin Donovan. also
a Vietnam veteran from Pitts-
burgh’s Northside. who called the
U.S. effort in Vietnam “murder."
He ‘told the crowd of an organi-
zation which he was in. called
Veterans for Peace. and also re-
marked that he would support
anyone who resisted going to the
war. -

Completely unexpectedly, a
small group of students sitting in
the midst of the crowd began
singins and performing in an an-

murder and concluded their per-
formance by getting stuck like
the needle on a record player to
the words, “The Bombs Bursting
In Air” of the National Anthem.

Wayne Ryback of the Univer-
sity Chemistry department, then
took the podium; stating that he
had planned to give a demonstra-
tion on the effects of napalm, but
had been hindered by the Pitts-
burgh Safety Director. He instead
explained the chemical make - up
of napalm and showed a compar-
ison of napalm and regular gas-
oline; explaining why it was so
deadly a weapon. ‘

Bouie Hayden, black community
leader and newspaper editor re-
ceived a standing ovation for his
speech concerning “War and the
Black Community.” He was fol-
lowed by equally accepted speak-
ers: Gerald Kaufman, State
Assemblyman, Jos Chasen, Uni-
versity professor and Monsignor
Charles Owen Rice of Holy Ro-
sary Church.

At 3:30, students again converg-
ed on the Cathedral lawn for
the assemblage for the protest
march to Mellon Square Park
(downtown) for a City—wide rally.
The march was led by Monsign-
or Rice and Sidney Peck, Asso-
ciate coordinator of the National
Mobilization committee. He was
also guest speaker at the rally.

At the end of the rally thous-
ands of black, green, red, and
white armbanded students, fac-
ulty, and citizens along with many
groups of anti-protesters, police-
men, and onlookers went home
with the thoughts generated by

Kaufman Endorses Moratorium

by BOB BON N
Staff Writer

Gerald Kaufman, a state assem-
blyman from Squirrel Hill, spoke
at one of a series of Vietnam Mora-
torium speakers on the Cathe-
dral lawn at 2:00 plm. Wednes-
day.

Kaufman, the only state assem-
blyman to endorse the Mora-
torium, began his talk by stating.
that he had been in the legisla-
ture for three years ‘ and,
“sys-

    

' protesting,

tern. He then cited a few ex-
amples of how Pennsylvania’s re-

” venue was spent: $3 million on
V housing, $3 million on employ-
: ment, $75 thousand on air pollu-

tion. and $35 on the University.

Yet the‘ federal government
spends $40 million a year on
war.

“It’s impossible to think about
that. I don’t know how I can any

 longer justify that system to you
' —- or me.”

“I, for one, am getting sick of
” continued Kaufman.
He compared protests such as
the day’s moratorium to going
to those who are profiting econom-
ically from the warand saying
“please don’t.”

Urging students to go beyond
mere protestation, Kaufman ad-
ded, “Please reverse the priority
system of this nation so we’ll

. have no more wars and get out of

Vietnam today!”

“Take ‘the system over your-,

ized but nonvilent turnover. “Or-
ganize politically in every town
in this state—you absolutely must
do it and absolutely must take
over the system.”

A true political movement, he

said, must form a political all-
iance with. housewives. poor

peoople, black people, and all
other members of the society.

Concluding his speech, Kauf-
man warned that he and all the
moratorium participants “must
become engaged together in a
very hard political struggle.”

    

 

Dr. James Holland, psycho|ogy:_
“Contract work from the govern-
ment is always mission-oriented
. . . it draws faculty too far away
from the business of professor
. . The Univershty should be
able to analyze situations objec-
tively, not as an ivory tower,

but as an independent center of

our society."

  

Bouie Raps to the crowd, and says,
“we must make the challenge at
home against all the evils of this
damn establishment. I am here,”
he continued. “because I believe
in war; war against racism, pov-

erty and oppressed peoples. He_

tells the crowd that if they think
they have done their -bit for
peace by just attending -the
moratorium,
“the struggle must be a con-
stant one,” he.concluded.

CHANCELLOR POSVAR
\

“The University cannot shut
down for anything on short no-
tice, even motherhood,” he con-
tinued.

Dr. Posvar, the individual, sup-
ported the Moratorium but
had reservations about the po-
tency of its effect. “I see the
Moratorium as having the pur-

pose of informing our leaders of

the strength of the opposition to
the war, but one must respect
the nature of the people who have
to make the decisions,” evalua-
ted the Chancellor.

“They are under the same pres-
sures and responsibilities as any
other would be Mr. McCarthy,

' Mr. Humphrey or former Presi-
‘ dent Johnson. They have the same

constraints and options.” he went
on. . T

Dr. Posvar expressed an optim-

 

hi
it .

ism that the Moratorium may move

the country to a solution, but “we
A must not expect the President to
act precipatively.” '
The effectiveness of continuing
the Moratorium on ‘the basis of
one day the first month, two days
the second, ect. was also ques-
tioned by the Chancellor.

“It is my personal opinion that
the principle effect is in the first
demonstration of feelings,” he
said. “It will probably diminish
afterithe first issue. Furthermore,
completely closing down higher

education will not contribute to .
the solution of the war. While this —

appears desirable to some, its
utility is in question.” » ’

If we may cite The Pharmacological

portions of the cortex, but its main action
isonthe psychic and sensory functions.
It produces a more rapid and clearer flow
of thought and allays drowsiness and
fatigue. After taking caffeine, one is ca-
pable of more sustained intellectual ef-

Two tablets—isn’t that likely to be
habit forming? Definitely not. NoDoz is
completely non-habit forming. ’

Which means it's safe to take .

 Vietnam Moratorium:

The Vietnam Moratorium has
drawn many people together be-
cause it offers one philosophy:
the philosophy of peace. Hawk.
dove or mixed up, individuals
have banded together for the com-
mon purpose of ending a war that
is taking lives, destroying con-
fidence and separating people.

Every level of community is
involved in this reevaluation of
motives and direction. No matter
what the political persuasions of
individuals, they are becoming
saddened and angered by the
weekly count of the war dead and

from a full scale march on a city

And people interpret such
moves in varying ways. Four
black women from the Hill

watched the train of marchers pass
them and the anger rose in their
faces. “You got about seven or
eight thousand kids there and
you can pick out one colored for
each thousand. The colored are

College held an anti-Moratorium
demonstration and sent a tele-

And then there were the peo-
ple on the bridge at Point State
Park. They were convinced that if
the marchers do not like this coun-
try and the way things are run
here, they should just leave.

People on the day of the Viet-

Robert Moorman. a former
associate of Dr. Timothy Leary
and a drug dependent himself
for six years, will tell the hor-
rors of drug abuse at University
of Pittsburgh on October 23 at
7:00 p.m. Su. Ballroom.

In 1961 Mr. Moorman went to
Cambridge, Mass. to begin his
college studies. It was not long
after he had started college that
Mr. Moorman “dropped out.”

During the next six years 
Moorman experimented with mari-
juana, ‘morphine and heroine,
L.S.D. and mescaline, ampheta-
mines, solvents and glues, rom-
alar and barbiturates.

The end of the road for the drug
dependent Robert Moorman came
in 1966 when he was arrested in
Tampa, Florida for grand larceny
and possession of narcotics. For
fourteen months, confined behind
,the fencesof the Florida /State
and County Prison System, Ro-

bert Moorman underwent a most,
painful and ‘agonizing rehabili-

_ tation. -

For the past two years, Mr. Moor-
man has lectured at high schools,

by KATHY KUNOLD
Staff Writer

"You can’t subscribe to the
theory that only a few» people
have dragged us into this war.
It is the way of life of this so-
ciety that made Vietnam possible
and unless it is changed will
make many more Vietnams pos-
sible.” ‘ ‘

Those were the words of Nat
Hentoff nationally - known au-
thor and critic of the war who
spoke Oct. 15th at the Allegheny
Campus of "the Community Col-
lege. Mr. Hentoff was keynote
speaker at a daylong -teach-in
that culminated with a student
march from the North Side to

Mellon Square to join marchers‘

from the University.

Mr. Hentoff, whose writings
appear in “The New. Yorker and
“The Village Voice,” recalled

. that he had felt apprehension a

few days ago by “underestimat-
ing the Machiavellian intelligence
of the present administration.”
It would have been quite easy

for Nixon to diffuse the Mora-’

torium by agreeing with its
goals, he commented, but in-

stead he gave impetus to it by
stating he would-fin no way be_

affected by it —‘ a, “remarkable
lesson in participatory democra-

cy‘)? .
When asked.if he felt meaning-
ful change in specific policies

could be accomplished by the"

ding Nixon is afraid, he doesn’t
want to be the first president
to lose a war but then I’ve been
told we’re not at war.

“I wouldn't be surprised if
_Sprio Agnew came out tomorrow

with a'secret document proving .

that on‘ his- death bed Ho Chi

remarked. .

The New York University pro-

the war itself and‘ into American
society to identify the factors
that have contributedfto the wars.
‘He descri-bed three of these fac-

*'9tors as the debasementof langu-

tortion of language as_the use of

terms like “the introduction, of

“leaf abscission” in place of de- '

as person whose urgeﬂfor peace

runs deeper than any other man,

he knew. “So subterranean in fact

that it isn’t detectable yet.” Hen-

He also looked at the govern-
ment cut in health research cen-
ters while at the same time
approving 15 billion dollars for
supersonic bombers as a ter-
rible mis-allocation of resources.

‘Hentoff also brought out ‘the fact

that since the end"of" World War
II_ one trillion dollars has been
spent on armaments that were
obsolete by the time they were
made.

He focused onthe need for rele-

vant education and the fact stu-

ask why —- “why the rules"”=l‘__t,i

Mr. Hentoff also spoke on

‘Best Film By A New Director

"Easy Rider”--

-9.

A

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Literary Editor

“A man went looking for America,
and couldn’t find it anywhere. . . .”

Easy Rider, an exploration into the

problems and prejudices of contemporary ‘

America, stars Peter Fonda, Dennis Hop-
per, and Jack Nicholson. Written by
Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern, the
film is presented by Pando Company in

* . association with Raybert Productions and

is now showing that the King’s Court
Theatre in Oakland. -
Released by Columbia Pictures, Easy
Ricer was chosen as the official U. S.
entry at the Cannes Film Festival where it

was voted best film by a new director. .

(It was directed by Dennis Hopper).
Easy Rider also won the International In-
terchurch Film Center. Award.

In the making of the film, Fonda and
Hopper went out looking for Americans to
play themselves. Easy Rider was filmed
between Los Angeles and the East Coast.
The stars and technicians, although they
had a story on paper, traveled until they
found locations they felt best fit their
needs. They would then scout around for
interesting onlookers, many of whom wound
up in the film itself. Hopper would ‘de-
scribe a script situation and ask their rea-

' ctions, which werefilmed and incorpora-

ted into the finished product. V

 

The power of Easy Rider lies in -the: —

portrayal of the search for freedom and
meaning in American life. Fonda, as
Wyatt (also called “Captain America”),
and Hopper, as Billy, start their journey
with money from illegal drug sales. Equi-
ped with motorcycles, they travel across

the country experiencing freedom, love,‘

hate, and prejudice.

After a brief stopoverat a farm, Wyatt A

congratulates the owner for “doing you
own thing in your own time. There aren’t
many people who can live off the land.”
The simple, uncomplicated life of the farm
is a kind of freedom.

.Afber being arrested for parading with-
out a permit (Wyatt and Billy had joined
a small-town patrotic display), the two find
themselves in the cell with a lawyer who
manages to get them all out with a little
palm greasing, since they “haven’t killed
anybody white.” .-

The lawyer joins Wyatt and Billy,
and the group proceeds on their way to
the Mardi Gras at New Orleans. The pre-
judice\ they encounter in a small‘ town
southern restaurant seems to be alittle
too blatant to be realistic, with ob-
vious remarks like “looks like trouble walk-

ing in,” and “they look like left overs from L
a gorilla love-in.” Another.“typical” Sou— ~

therner remarks: “A gorilla couldn’t love
that. A mother couldn’t love that.”

The focus of meaning in Easy Riderl
l comes, I think, out of a fireside discus-

sion  which the lawyer tells‘ Billy

AFi

that “people fear you for what you repre-
sent — freedom.” Billy replies: “So what’s
wrong with freedom? That’s what it’s -all
about.” Again, this is just a little too ob-
vious, although it does produce emotional
reactions.

‘Easy Rider is a film.with alot to say. ,

It communicates, says .Fo_nda, “to the

. now generation'.”‘ This includesa ‘complex
film sequence of an LSD trip by Wyatt, .

Billy, and two New Orleans Prostitues,
full of religous symbolism.’ Easy Rider lS

. a film to experience, not enjoy. The mes-

sage is always sharp and culminates in
a brief exchange between Wyatt and Billy

 Praises Panthers

by ED CONLEY

, If Jim Pittman’s Tulane gridders can score as many points
’,in tomorrow’s game against the Panthers as the coach does
when it comes to distributing complements, Carl DePasqua
and his resurgent Jungle Cats may find some difficulty in ob-
, taining their third straight win in the stadium encounter

thers are hitting people defen-
sively. The defense, in fact, is
credited with crushing any
hopes of victories by the oppos-
ition in the last two weeks.

The quarterback has been the
main target of the Cat’s aggres-
siveness.. DePasqua’s defensive
demons have caught the sig-
nal callers twenty times for big

_ losses on passpplays. And there’s

additional good news for the de-
fensive unit this week. End Paul
Naponick i's scheduled to return
to action after a back injury.

,Pittman has had some quarter-
backing problems so far. He’s
been alternating two sophomores,
and Rusty Lachaussee appears to
be his starter, at the moment.

“He’s a grown-up boy,” Pan-
ther assistant Steve Petro, who
scouted Tulane, said. “He’s im-
proved remarkably well. He’s
proven he can throw, and he
can run. I saw him run where it
meant something and he brought
in good dividends.”

’ Last week, Lachaussee almost
guided the Green Wave to one of
the biggest upsets of the year.
Pittman’s gridders lost by one

“But, our boys seem to be in
good spirits after the letdown,
Pittman noted. “It’s a matter of
getting prepared mentally to play
another big strong football team.”

“The staff feels that football
is a game of execution. That’s

something we haven’t done in,

the first few games.”

That sounds like something
Carl DePasqua would say. In
fact, DePasqua has been talking

about execution and big strong
football since he took over the
reigns of the gridders.

There’s more similarity between‘
the mentors’ attitudes, too. They’re
both happy with the performances
of their punters this fall, and that
means that there’s a good possi-
bility of tomorrow’s game becom-
ing a battle of field position.

Spicko, g has a 40 yard-per-punt
average.

All of this similarity should
mean that the game will be close.
The odds-makers think so, any-
way. They’ve listed the Panthers
as a slim, 21/2 point favorite. A

“It seems a lot of people know
more_about football than the coa-

ﬂweston Makes Big Hit’ at Tackle
I

Wins Starting Job

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor
Lloyd Weston is a happy
man, a very happy man.

Tomorrow afternoon when
the Panthers host Tulane,
Lloyd Weston will be holding
down a starting tackle spot on
the defensive line, and the star-
ting job means a lot to the big,
likable junior from Pittsburgh.

“I’ve been working very hard,”

' explained Lloyd. “We have a lot

of good ball players on the de-
fense, and ‘the competition is
good. I’m happy, very happy to
be starting.”

Weston hasn’t been in the star-
ting line-up for the Panthers
since early last season. A knee
injury hampered him through-
out the year. Playing at line-
backer, he had been touted by
“Sports Illustrated Magazine” as
one of the top sophomore pros-
pects in the country in pre-
season but he never got achance
to live up to his billing.

At the start of fall practice
this season, Weston was play-
ing on the line, at defensive end,

‘where he backed up starters

Bob Ellis and Paul Naponick.
After the second game of the
season, however, Weston was
moved from end to tackle and
the move has proven to be a
favorable one.

,“I feel more comfortable at
tackle than at end,” Lloyd ex-
plained. “I like to hit and you
do a lot of hitting at tackle. I
played on the line in high
school, so the position isn’t real-
ly that new to me. Now that I’ve
been playing at tackle, I like it
better than ,my old linebacker
position.” .

Weston has stayed away from
injuries so far this season and he
feels that his experience has
been a big factor

in staying

Mike McNa||en in last week's big win over Navy. After his fine game
last week, Lloyd won a starting job for tomorrow's game against Tu-
lane. Weston cloesn’t prefer pass rushing to running play defense, he

iust likes to “get in there and hit."

healthy. “I was in shape last
year, but the experience helps
me this year. I have more ex-
perience this year; I know what to
look for; I know what to expect.”

The Panther defensive line
has been highly publicized for
its size this season, but Lloyd
feels that the size this season,
but ’L1oyd feels that the size
hasnt been the major factor
for the line’s success. “Our suc-
cess so far, especially against
the rush, has come from hard

'work_ and determination. I don’t
[think we’re much bigger than

anybody else.”

And when questioned about the
defense playing together as a unit,
Lloyd lets the record speak for
itself. “We’ve won two games,”
he emphasized. “I know we’re
playing as a team.” '

At 6’1”,

235 pounds, Lloyd _

loves to hit. “I jus like to get
in there and make tackles,” ex-

plains the former high school all-'

American from nearby Westing-
house. “I’m very comfortable
right now.” .

As for the Tulane game to-
morrow afternoon, Lloyd explains
that the Panthers will be up
against a “tough team.” “We’ll
do a variation of things against
them on defense,” he continued.
“There’s not any one thing set.
We’ll use them all.”

Weston isn’t making any pre-
dictions about the outcome of
the Panthers’ contest with Tu-
lane, but you can bet he’ll be

-doing his best to help chalk up

win number three..He’s in the
starting line-up right ' now,
and he wants to stay there, per-
manently.

Divulges   A
Starting Line-ups  l 

Freshman football Coach Bill Quinter announced the prob-
able starting lineup for today’s game against the West Vir-

ginia Frosh.

Included in the first - string
end, Rich Oldshue and Ernie Web

offense are Reginald Frye at split
ster at the tackles, Gary Patterson ,

and Bill Mercer at the guard positions, Paul Yuna at center, tight

end Dean Arlett, John Hogan
at quarterback, flanker Jim Par-
ros, Joe Herndon at the tailback
slot, and Myron Kunka at full-
back. -

The defensive unit will be
comprised of «Joe Kovacic and
Oldshue at ends, Mike Grahovic
and Webster at the tackles, Spen-
cer Potter at middle guard, line-
backers’George Fehr and Mer-
cer, cornerbacks Parros and Frye,
and Tom Hasbach and Bob Dom-
erque at the safety positions.

If Coach Quinter makes no
last-minute changes in his start-

cer, Oldshue, and-Pa_rros will be 

serving double duty._ Quinter
doesn’t intend to let these five
burn out before the final gun
has sounded..

“We’ll be substituting a great
deal” explained Quinter.
“trying to work in as many-of ‘
the boys as we can. Each of
them has progressed a great deal
since we began practicing, and-
I’m confident that all of them—
will play well during the game.”

Game time is 3 p.m. -at For-
bes Field. The Cubs close their

much rougher than the re-

squad.

Full back Jerry Kruth spoke
even more optimistically. .“I
seriously don’t believe that we'll

Valencia mentioned that since
the booters have rolled over
both ‘Temple and Grove City,
the remainder of the schedule

“Ohio has lots of material.

Record On The Line

by JERRY MYERS

, A .. Tomorrow will be a big day for the men of Coach James
,. Banner, the cross country team. Invading the Steel City will
“be the Mountaineers of West Virginia who will battle the har-
riers in what could amount to the toughest meet the Pan-
 thers have competed in so far’ this season.

It is hard to imagme 3 91°59’ .finished fourth in the .’68 meet

against Pitt, and is in top shape
for tomorrow’s competition.

He is a native of Pennsylvania
and hit the big time when he plac-
ed third in the High school divi-
sion two mile run at the Penn

‘Relays. His time was a slick 9:32.

Since then he has served West.
Virginia coach Stan Romanoski
for three years, running cross
country-and putting in more than
100 training miles weekly. A
November 1968 operation sidlined’

Payne late in the ’68 season but ’

he’s back in top condition for tom-
morrow’s meet.

Thus at 11:00 tomorrow morn-
ing up on Flagstaff hill, West
Virginia will try to snap the Pitt
Harriers 5_-0 mark. This fifth

meet of the regular season is also

the second of three dual meets
the squad has scheduled for this
season. The harriers anticipate
a much toughter match than they
did with Cleveland State on Oc-:
tober 2, when they won easily

15-61. Their third and last dual -

meet will be with Penn State on
November 1.

great effort to beat us,” remark-
ed coach Bemis.

The thing that really delights
Bemis is the fact that his squad is
playing a cohesive team game. Un-
like last season, the booters no
longer rely on arfew key indivi-
duals. The only position that has
given Bemis any cause to wor-
ry has been the vital goalie spot.’

However, Kerry Krause and
freshman Steve Fibel have filled
the position without much diffi-
culty. Krause hasn’t participated
in the last few games because of
a shoulder ‘injury, and it now
appears as though Fibel will have
to play himself out of the posi-
tion if Krause or anyone else. is
to guard the nets. ,

“Fibel has played very re-
spectably. He plays a smart
game. He may not be as great
as the Grove City. goalie, but he’s’

Captures "'A” League Lead

by MIKE MILLER

Random House handed ‘Pleasure Palace a 25-0 trouncing_

Tuesday to remain undefeated in A league intramural foot-

ball.

Random House received the
opening kick-off and then laun-
ched an_ air attack. Quarantillo

fired a pass to Jim’, Madigan,

and then hit Lou Frank_in the
end zone for six points. A pass
conversion failed.

After receiving the kick, Pleas-—
sure Palace promptly lost the
ball when Quarantillo snagged a

' Bob Maylek pass.

Quarantillo dropped another
touchdown pass into Van Kraus’s
outstreached hands ‘but the con-

. version fizzled again.

The Palace offense, unable to
move the ball, surrendered it to
the Random defenders. Random’s

- Lou Frank netted -another Quaran-

tillo pass to put the score at 18-0.
The run conversion was again a
fiasco.

V Jim Matigamsnatched, another-
pass from Palace’s Bob Maylek-
to put Random on the offense
again. 7

Maylek, however, intercepted
a Quarantillo pass from the
Palace but was unable to move

the ball and surrendered it to _

Random House.

The Palace defense then for-
ced Random House to punt, but
lost the ball on the first‘play
when Willie Manteris intercep-

V

ted a pass and ran it for a touch- «

down. The conversion netted
another point and put the score
at 25-0.

Although Pleasure Palace was
able to _intercept ‘a pass and carry
the ball to theone yard line,
they were thrown for a loss and
were unable to score. The final
score stood at 25-0 Random
House.

I. ‘Random House will go into its
third game Monday undefeated.

No games were scheduled for
Wednesday, ,October, 15 in ‘ob-'
servance of the Viet Nam Mora-

Fibel is not the only freshman
to contribute to the team’s rebuilt
confidence. Forward John White .-
and Fullback Gary Mydock have
started and played well in both
victories. White missed in the
Grove City encounter because of g f_
sickness, but should be ready for
