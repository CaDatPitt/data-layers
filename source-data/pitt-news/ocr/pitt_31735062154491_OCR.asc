Y.W.C.A. MAKES PLANS ‘
. FOR SUMMER CAMP

Plans for Eaglesmere conference,
the Y. W. C. A. convention of this
district held every summer, were
discussed at a. meeting of the Y." W.
C. A. cabinet on Tuesday. .

'.'Mrs. C‘. E. ,Warren,, advisor to
the industrial committee of the cabi-
net, ‘led, the .disc.uss_ion of “The
Problem.s*..of the Industrial Girl”
which followed. ,  . - , 

_She .explained the ’ purpose of the
industrial department of the nation-
al Y. W; C- A. and the worklof
the industrial committee of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in particular.
“The study -of the girl who works
in —-the-» toy factories is the special
projectofgthe Y. -W. _
year,’-’ states Mrs. _Warren..

“Smoking is a matter of ‘personal
taste,”» a generalconsensuscof opin-
ion among house mothers and worn-
en campus leaders shows. _

Lillian Kirsh, Ed. ’29, president
of W. A. A., touches the keynote of
the response to the common ques-
tion: “What do you think"-of wom-
on smoking?” “It’s just like eat-
ing peanuts; it's "a purely personal
matter. Some like it and some
don’t. However, if done to excess,
it becomes a vice.. It is all right
for girls-to smoke in restaurants,”
she thinks. ~ ‘ .

“Indulgence in cigarettes has sev-
eral motives,” explains Alice Mc-
Afee, Ed. ’29, president of Panhel-
lenic. “Some girls smoke because
they think it’s smart, ' others be-
cause ‘the crowd does it’ and others
because they really enjoy it. If a
girl does it for either of the ﬁrst
two reasons, she shows"-a weakness
which may be repeated ina more
decisive‘ matter. Although I have
become used to. seeinggirls smoke,
I can’t help but detract twenty" per
cent from my opinion of them.”

Elizabeth Goedeke, Bus. Ad. ’29,
president of Y. W. C. A., states, "I
don’t like to see a group of‘ girls
get together and smoke in a frater-
nity house, but if a girl wants to
smoke in a car in the evening,'it is
all right.” '  —- - ~ A. v

’29, president of —W. S. G.- A., and
adds, from the practical side, “Heinz
House has burned down twice al-
ready, and it was insured the last
time with the provision that there
would be no smoking in it. ‘Of
course, ‘this means __men as well as
women.”  _

From the women's fraternity
houses comes: the attitude of the
house mothers. ‘Mrs. Mabel Cooper
of the Kappa Alpha‘ Theta house is
from England where smoking is so
prevalent that no one discusses it
any more. “It detracts from a
girl's feminine charm. Women
shouldhave different standards than
men,”_ she believes. - ‘ ~

“I would rather have girls smoke
in the house in my presencethan
be -deceitful about it,’ Mrs. Estelle
Green, whois in charge ofvthe Al-
pha Epsilon‘ Phi house says.

.“I do not approve of it at all. It
.is not- allowed in thehouse, for men
or women. Thenational headquar-
ters do not sanction it,” is ..what
Miss’ Luta N annah, Delta Delta Del-
ta housemother, said. ' l

Weber Submits Plans   

Mr. "Weber has drawn three sepa-f~_-"95  I
rate sketches showing possible ways. .‘
of remodeling the hut. "They" differ
in detail, but none provides for en-
larging the building. as a remedy for - i
the crowded conditions, and none .'
has proved entirely satisfactory. Mr.‘ . 
Weber is now in“Philadelphi-a and ' "
his return, scheduled. for tomorrowﬁg
may help .to iclarifyithe situation.‘ I ‘ ‘

The tentative alteration plans p\itt5‘5 ._ 
forward by the Y. M. C.’ A._ call for  '
the construction of several new of-
ﬁces" along the northern side ofthe .~ .:
hut and the- conversion of the  * ‘ ‘ '
lobby into. a large commons room.
This would -permit concentration of , ..
the oﬁices of clean of men, assistant.‘ ' .

ment bureau, ‘graduate manager of :3‘
student activities and student pub-‘J
lications and also‘ provides. roomﬂ”

was -suggested that students. ‘carry; : ..-,

. Mrs. Alice Wilker, manager "of

in talking over’ debating with us he
mentioned “that in most reasoning
you can come to no conclusion at all,

"so the best thingto do is to do like

a woman -and not reason at all.” . _

. ..dent Council entertained the
students of the "February graduating
classes of the three Erie high
schools, Central, East and Academy,
with a dance at the Sunset Country
club on February 1. The ballroom
was decorated with banners of Pitt
and the visiting high schools.

The committee in charge consisted
of ‘William Runser, Pre. Med. '32,

Ralph Weber, Bus. Ad. ’82; Jean

Head Addresses Teachers

Dr. W. W. D. Sones, head of the
Erie Center, gave two addresses be-
fore high school teachers of Erie

at Central high school, Wednesday». _ _
afternoon. The first was to . the. 

teachers of natural science concern- 1
ing the proposed twelve year public -

school science course. . -

-“The ‘school science program at
present is a haphazard patchwork‘ of
‘unrelated courses,” declared Dr.
Sones. “The aim is to unite these
as a whole extending froin..the'. pri-

mary grade through the -‘senior-‘year._

in high school.” In closing Dr. Sones
prophesied: “The new science curri-
culum-in which I have been assigned
responsibility for the junior high

school section,.the attempt is to be.

made to develop an integrated.
twelve year program which "will be
a distinctly new and, it is thought,
progressive step.” . ~ 

In his second address, Dr. Sones
spoke to the group teaching com-
'mercial courses. Of these subjects
he said:

“The recent advances in commer-
cial educational subjects has dis-
played the most progressive practice
of any subjects recently introduced
into high school curriculum. The
courses were admittedgbecause of
demand from without the school’ and‘
were immediately placed on the de-
fensive in relation to the academic
subjects which have been there so
long. This stimulated remarkable
developments and progressive re-
search which results in progressive
methods and a practical curriculum
in the bookkeeping and secretarial

A record for one day re 'stration

for the._-‘second semester. This num-
ber exceeds by 200 the largest num-
ber of students ever registered in

College. Leads in Numbers
Reports, from Johnstown junior

have entered and that 180 students

registered for the second semester,

bringing the total enrollment to 192.
The colleges reports 1,795 stu-

The school of

Because of the exceptionally great
number of students who registered

Quick states that when -present

P Boasting the best forward in the
country, Charley Hyatt,'one of the
best guards, Eddie Baker, and one of
the leading cage coaches in collegi-
ate circles, the Panther basketball
team undoubtedly finds it hard to
look back on its record thus far.
Five games are marked up on the
wrong side of the ledger with ten
victories to ofl"set'them, giving Carl-
son’s men a percentage of .666. This
time last year, the Pitt team had
nothing butbrilliant victories behind,
it and was riding along at a terriﬁc
clip to climax an undefeated season.
Twenty-one straight triumphs over
the best teams that theathletic de-
partment could schedule made Cap-’
tain‘ Reed and his men the most
feared ‘team’ in the country, national

champions". =‘ --

‘_ “Oil the surface _’ things _ look‘
sort of blue for this y_ear’s Pan-
‘ther cage quintet, but when one
realizes that the Pittteam has
trimmed Ohio State, Dartmouth,

' Iowa, and has handed Army a
terriﬁc thumpinglfor its,_on1y
"setback-thu's— far,‘ and when we '
know that Charley Hyatt is sec-
ond in national scorers’ in col- '
legiate circles, we conclude that-

, the Pitt-‘basketball?’ team isfar
« above the: average and still-one
of ‘:the strongest teams in the‘
‘East, Of the - six remaining
_ games on.-the Pitt schedule only
one. tilt oﬂiers the Panthers an-
other opportunity to‘ 'demon- '
, strate ._theii_.'- worth on the hard-'
iwood._,The return game at Mor- '
gantow-n _with West Virginia, '
Saturday, March 2, should prove

they will not only gain sweet

Alth_ou,h _rnost- coaches, in «all

d sports oppose the-publication‘ o_f in‘-

dividual accomplishments of their
players, since it tends toward
jealousy. in some cases, the individ-
ual_record of Pitt’s dashing forward,
Charley Hyatt, is both. remarkable
and interesting. Not ,including the
Wash-Jeff game. Wednesday -night,
Hyatthas scored 201 points to place
him’ second to Lou Zara of Rider
College, whocontinues in the‘ role
‘of pacemaker for the Eastern col-
lege basketball scorers with 220
.points. Hyatt gained considerable’ in
the race .by his high scores‘ in recent
games, twenty"-eight "points. sepa-
rating the pair a week ago. ‘
Zara is a member of the un-
defeated‘ Rider quintet which
has ’won 15 straight games ,
fwithout a defeat. His score was
. made -in these‘ ﬁfteen contests,-

while the Pitt ace hasplayed "inf

To get some‘ idea as to how the
other high scorers rank, we learn
that Joey Schaaf of Pennsylvania,
whose team‘ is‘ leading the’ ‘Eastern
Intercollegiate League, is, next in

of St. John’s, Wineapple of Provi--
dence, Frank-of Rider. and Many of
Lehigh are closely bunched. Bo-b
Many, incidentally, set what is be-
lieved to be, the season’s high mark
on Saturday when the -Bethlehem
team swamped Susquehanna... He
tallied twenty-eight points. ‘
. .._.o_...

The Fordham quintet still
trails the Rider team in the
matter of games won and lost.
These two are the only ﬁves
which have not‘. suffered defeat.
The Maroon has won fourteen
games and Rider ﬁfteen.

In addition to Hyatt’s 82 - ﬁeld
