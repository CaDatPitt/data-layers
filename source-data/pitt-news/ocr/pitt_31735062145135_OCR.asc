JOHN G. BOWMAN, J

The ﬁrst football game
played between the Alumni and the
Varsity made a big hit last Saturday
at the Stadium, and hundreds of Pitt
“grads" came out to see the “Old
Timers” in action. It was a treat
to watch Marsh Johnson, Charlie
Bowser, “Horse” Chase, Tommy Hol-
leran, “_Jakie” Bohren and other
stars play a bang-up game against
the» Varsity. If ever there was an
All-American team collected, the
“Old_Ti'mers” certainly were it. ‘-

Among the’ stars who competed
V/were Charlie Bowser, assistant coach
-of the University; alph Chase,
‘coach at Mclieesport High; Ulhard
Hangartrier, assistant coach _at B
nell; Marsh Johnson, former coach at‘
Dickinson and now with‘ the Good-

W. .Va.; “Pie” Williams, assistant
athletiedirector at Pitt; Tommy Hol-
leran, coach at‘ Thiel; “Speedo”
Laughran,-r who is in the insurance
game’ in Pittsburgh; Jakie Bohren,
in the same game, with headquarters
in the ‘Commonwealth Building;
'Andy Hastings, with the Blaw Knox
._Steel Co.; Jack Harding, coach‘ at
St. Thomas College, Scranton; “Bill”
Ashbaugh, who is -practicing dentis-
' try in Washington, —Pa.; Frank Bene-
dict,-practicing dentistry in Midland;
Lloyd Jordan, coach at Jeannette
High School; Nick Colonna, practic-
ingﬁdentistry in Woodlawn; “Buck”
Templeton, assistant line coach at
Pitt; Blair McMillin, coach at Clear-
ﬁeld High School; John Anderson,
coach at Donora High Schoo1;»“Zel_:e”
Wissinger, assistant coach at Pitt;
“Tiny” Linn, with the Weirton. Steel
Co., and severalothers.

The game was no sinecure for the
varsity, by any means, although they
ﬁnally won it by the score—Of 2-0, a
safety bringing defeat to the _“Old
Timers.” Of course, thevarsity did
notgtake too many <_:hances,Vw1th the
Stanford game in view, butit was a
real football game, nevertheless, and
the. “Old Timers” sh_owed_they did
A not have manykinks in their system,
during the game, at’ least. Undoubt-
edly, the_ consumption of Varnica and
other remedies increased for several
days after theV-game.

AN EARLY LOVE‘
Some of our friends found it
diﬁlcult a few: ‘weeks ago to
understand the emotion We un-Q
veiled the. ﬁrst day we had in

s ‘ourpossesion a copy of the new
edition of Carl Van Vechten’s
Peter Whiﬁle (Knopf, $4.00)."

We’ll explain.

It carried us back to the

freshman era. Of our discov-
eries .in thatﬁera‘ of discoveries,‘
Peter’ Whiﬁle made muchcmore

of an impression on us thanfdidf «
' those connected with classrooms ‘

and fraternities.‘ Our‘ first‘ foot-

_ ball , spectacle in Forbes Field.
is confused‘ with later games? in
‘the, Stadium; the agonies ’ ofi
_ _ chemistry quizzes are-gone ; even,

‘the freshman banquet of roast‘

beef, mashed potatoes, and

AA green peas, _,has been .digesAtcd;'

But we.still.. remember the old

«ladyiwho didn’t like the ‘damp.
“ gondolas in1Venice-,» and the.’
perfume dealer in Paris. who

swooned. with artistry. They
‘were’ in Peter. Whiﬁle. ‘
a Peter", Whiﬁle didmore than

’ entertain. us. From it we “ap-1
propriatedr not a few‘ words
‘ that brightened. up; freshman

themes-;.. “chartreuse,”"‘ ’we’_ re-,
member,-»made an impression on
the theme reader. And we hear_d,i
for the ﬁrst time, of Cezanne,_A
_. Manet, Arthur Machen,A
 Bakst, John Maseﬁeld, Anatole:

France, and a. score of other}
personalities whom we investi-
gated, at least smatteringly, be-
fore. the yearjended‘. Much of

- what: little sophistication we
now posses. dates back to those...

 Aﬁrst days with Peter... Whiﬁle.

in this rnatter-wouldiseerii to  by
ment with the practfcal viewpoint of
the definition. ' I ' '. l ’

F. W.,~: by taking Judge.‘ Lindsey’:
deﬁnition ,at,' its face value, ﬁnds
nothing '”r'evo1utiona.i-y- about‘ such
marriages and that "they. ditfei from
the ordinary concept‘ of ‘marriage
only in the written ‘contract to have

and in the non-‘assumptiolyof any
‘ﬁnancial responsibilities.‘ by one for

the other: I
‘If therein lie the only differences,
persons, certain or uncertain /of‘ the‘
lasting qualities of their love, can
‘contract by an "ante-nuptial agree-
ment‘ to: be. self-supporting'._for any
set period of tirAne:.and- to keep sepa-
rate apartments-. I know of /no’ ob-
jections. to such 'a. contract being
legally ,bin_di_ng' r_1or,“I am. certain, is
it against public policyu" .
Persons in an ordinary marriage
very often. tacitly agree to control
the rateand immediacy of childbirth.
So those whose careers must’ not
be interfered; with‘*.by"'a home with
children. need’ not resort to com-
parlionate -‘marriage’, but can "obtain
the sameobjectiver by adding 5. sim-
ple agreernent . or understanding so

present ideal in mind--that -“some

‘ Reading between the lines of
Judge LinAdsey’s deﬁnition the con-
clusion is‘ inevitable that his concept
of companionate. marriagje had ‘its
inspiration‘ in the confessions of his
private, inoral clinic. Although we
give him ‘credit fortrying to find a
new remedy for moral delinquency,
yet  Acannot forgive ‘him the ill-
respect"-hé_ shows, for us college stu-
dents by ‘choosing us as his cru-
saders. ‘ A ‘

F. W., like Judge Lindsey, would
have society recognize “the univer-
sality of the sex impulse in human
beings” by legalizing unbridled pas-
sion. Companionate marriage would
be a godsend to those who have al-
lowed their sexual atavisms to gain
control ‘over themselves. '

Society has long recognized the
strength of the sex impulse in
humankind and. has A ever found it
best to A contilgl’. and to direct it
pro borfto publico. '

The Ofundamental unsoundness of
companionate marriage A lies in the
mental attitude with which partici-
pating parties would enter into such
a. contract. Starting with the prem-
ise that if they develop incompati-
bility of temperament, or. grow tired
of each. other or see someone more
“attractive,” it will not be long be-
fore one “of the parties will desire
a. dissolution of the union. Divorce

Dear Mister Editor: _ -' _
Regarding a blurb. in your sheet last week-—the ca.-
reer of its author, contrary to his own statement, has
evidently been neither long _nor colorful. ',_T,he‘1'c‘ is a.‘
gap somewhere in the experience of one who*—confesse.s'
to never ‘having heard Mr. Sousa’s complete. ag-_'

gregation of musicians make the rafters Aringiover‘. in
Syria Mosque. Furthermore, in ascribing to Sousa
“the gusto of a scullery maid washing dishes” (the
simile seems a bit self—consciousi) he fails to take into
account the fact that Sousa is over seventy years. of
age and so may be pardoned?‘ ..1£-‘the ‘ does not
dash across the platform like an :incarnation of v the
Denis-Shawn dancers. Moreover, and, in addition,
there is “a place for everything, including. even__band~
music; I, as did the lamented T. T. O. Y. P., enjoy the
way Percy Crosby draws Skippy, without any invidious
comparisons with Rembrandt; Moran and Mack with‘-
out dragging in Ethel Barrymore; and John Philip
Sousa without any reference to Walter Damrosch and
the New York Symphony. When these column hounds"
feel an urge toward destructive criticisms they would
do well to conﬁne their eiforts to subjects of which they;
have a more thorough grasp. The*more IA think..of.it.,
the more that last thought appeals, to me. - Maybe:

Artillery march. If that is the case I am sure Major
Horsfal wouldﬂbe glad to explain -it.” In spite of fre-
quent references by the author of the aforementioned
blurb to philosophy, poetry, et cetera, I sometimes have.
doubts about his grounding in. the fundamentals. . ,_
As for the Penn theatre, he may go as -far as he"
likes. No crack in that direction could be very far‘
from the truth. . '
Yours for a more interesting Weekly, ‘ .
An Ardent Admirer.

The attorney for‘ the defense, lacking-personall the
intellectual fertility to make the answer. the etter
merits, can only quote, with habitual in_accuracy,- from
none other than George Bernard Shaw, the little
dickens. .— l - '
“There is nothing that hurts -a‘ goodpconversation
as much as a thorough knowledge of the subject.” ~
To which the appropriate. reply is‘, “Oh, pshaw!"
(Get. it?). The Irishman’s crack ought to squelch the
conscientious objectors, but, if ’ not, it may help to ' 0‘
into detail. After all, you don;’t‘have to read this‘.,_,'%o

make clear, is in a football stadium, not in a theater.-
Neither, beloved, was anyone trying to make’ a com-

it was a comparison between the Sousathat was and
the Sousa that should have been. Martial’ music should

w HE way of the road builder and contractor is often

rocky.

Submerged boulders and outcropping

ledges of rock call a sudden halt in the job.

out of the way—~bi-ockholing? snakeholing? or mud-
capping? What’s the best way to determine the size ‘
and position of a boulder? What’s the correct load -
and method of loading for each kind of rock?

These and many other questions not included in any
engineering course will come up out on the job.

_ They’re only details, it’s true, but apt to be mighty
 annoying and troublesome details. .You’ll ﬁnd the
