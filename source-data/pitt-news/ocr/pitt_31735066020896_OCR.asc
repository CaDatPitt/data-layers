Casey addresses college tuition and financial aid

By Lou Grieco
and Matt Martin
The Pitt News

HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania
Gov. Robert P. Casey unveiled
his $21.4 billion 1989-90 budg-
et proposal before a joint assem-
bly of the House and Senate
yesterday, citing drug education,
treatment and enforcement as the
major concerns of his adminis-

tration.

”Drugs and addiction are the
single greatest threat to family life
in Pennsylvania today,” Casey
told the delegates. ”|t’s almost
impossible to overstate the
problem.”

Casey said that an estimated
700,000 Pennsylvanians are ad-
dicted to alcohol and other drugs,
and he noted a new trend, ”a
young generation of urban poor

that's being decimated by co-
caine and crack.’’,

The budget would provide $10
million in state and federal funds
for law enforcement purposes, in-
cluding the creation of a Drug
Law Division under the direct su-

pervision of the deputy attorney

general.

Casey also called for $3.5 mil-
lion. in federal funds to be used
to rehabilitate intravenous drug

users in an effort to stop the
spread of AIDS, and $650,000 in
state and federal funds for drug
prevention programs in secon-
dary schools.

Human services were also tar-
geted by Casey as major areas for
increased appropriation. The
budget includes an additional $4
million with the $30.million al-
located last year for county chil-
dren services, along with

Reagan administration "charged with racism

By Erik Kridle
. Staff Writer

' Former President Ronald Rea-
gan left office last month for
' retirement in California and left

'-fﬁkmerica with a ’’legacy of ra-

cism,” according to a statement
issued recently by the University
of Pittsburgh department of black
studies.

”Although Reagan has gone,
the court that he created is a court
which is showing bias,” said
Dennis Brutus, chairman of the
black. studies department.

H’  During his eight years as presi-

-Qzlent, Reagan filled three of the

vacancies on the Supreme Court
with politically ’-’conservative”
appoi.ntees. A .. _ 

Recently the Supreme Court
declared unconstitutional the ef-
forts of Richmond, Va. to require
a fixed percentage of public

’ works funds for construction con-

tracts to be awarded to. blacks
and other minorities.

With this decision, the
Supreme Court said that any ef-
fort through affirmative action on

the part of a governmental body .

must be shown to be in response
to, or in prevention of overt dis-
crimination if the quota is to sur-
vive a.court challenge. ,

The black studies department
cites this decision as one proof of
its claim.

The statement, issued on Jan.

.26, states that ”instead of trying
to repair the damage of jghundredsl ‘

of years of racism or even trying
to halt the damage being done by
racism at the present time, the
Reagan court is signaling that ra-
cism can be actively re-
instituted.” ,

Many now believe that courts
will become crowded with cases
brought by white plaintiffs who
would challenge affirmative ac-
tion quotas as discrimination
against whites, as noted in an ar-
ticle run by The New York Times
on Jan. 25.

’’I think it is important to have
a reaction to the Supreme Court's
ruling so the decision does not

_pass without comment or criti-
cism,” said Brutus.

The statement accuses Pitt of

 

making ”feeble’.’ fﬁfiffmativegac-__. - .

tion efforts in the past.

At present, university adminis-
trators are considering a proposal,
made by a University Senate,
committee on affirmative action
to allocate $5 million specifical-
ly for the ”recruitment” and
”retention" of minority faculty.

Pitt Professor Barbara Shore, a
member of the Senate committee,
says the committee did -not find
”enormous progress” being
made in attracting new minority
faculty to Pitt.

The black studies department,
however, ' feels official action

proposal could be a longtime in _

Casey also revealed plans for a
Child Abuse Prevention initiative,
costing $6.1 million which will

aid an additional 25,000 chi|-     A

educaﬂon
concerns   

By Brendan H. Kevenides ’ 

Senior Staff Writer

Editor's Note: The following is  v ;
the last installment of a three—part . 
series investigating t"le incidents A g.  .
and allegations surrounding the . 
conviction of political activist  

Lyndon LaRouche.

When he first entered the.po-  ‘ 
litical arena in the late '60s, Lyn-’ _;
don LaRouche lectured college 

students about his economic
ideologies.

Today, from a county jail in
Alexandria, Va., LaRouche still

enjoys the opportunity to speakii‘ H
to students on issues he views as.-

important.
LaRouche, who has run for the

presidency at least three times_.__7'
over the past 20 years, said that
the federal government must ex-. ' .
pend an effort to see that all peo-   
ple are given, the opportunity to. . A 

attend college. V -

He said that the present‘ 
difficulty many students encoun”-gr 1 
ter when applying to college” 

comes from a poor secondary
education. 1

" ”’We’ve had a collapse of qual- -  _
ity in secondary education over ..  "
the past 20 years," LaRouche. ’ ,1 ‘’
said. ”Today, universities essen_-  J"
tially start with people ‘who are. ,s _g_

functionally illiterate." -

LaRouche attributed what he.  ~
called ”the look-saY" method of,   ‘
teachingas being the causeof a “'
decaying high school system. ’

With this method, students,sim-

ply repeat information which has .  v

been thrown to them, he said.
In a world that is decaying, said

«LaRouche, education today]

Congress shoots down controversial ne

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
House and Senate voted over-
whelmingly Tuesday to scuttle a
$45,500 congressional pay raise.
They sent the measure to Presi-
dent Bush for his signature in
time to prevent the increase from
taking effect at midnight.

The House voted 380-48 to
block the 51 percent salary boost,
and the Senate concurred less

' than three hours later by a 94-6

margin. The Senate had passed a
similar but not identically word-
ed measure, 95-5, last week.

White House spokesman Mar-
lin Fitzwater said Bush would
sign the bill, which also would
kill large pay raises for federal
judges and senior officials in the
executive branch. ”The president
will abide by the wishes of the
Congress,” he said.

Lawmakers in both houses said
the votes were a bow to over-
whelming public sentiment
against the big boost in the cur-
rent congressional pay of
$89,500 a year.

”You can fight city hall and you
can take on the Congress of the

as their pride,” he declared.

United States with all its legerde—
main and all its legislative abili-
ty,” said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.

”We face reality here today,”
said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Ca|if., in
staunch support of the increase.
”We’re doing what has become
inevitable.”

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -

The government has armed.

30,000 Communist Party mem-
bers in Kabul and thousands
more in towns and villages in
case guerrillas attack after all the
Soviet troops are gone, a spokes-
man said Tuesday.

Nab Amani of the Foreign
Ministry said the party members
will continue their regular jobs
but ”have been armed to defend
their homes,” neighborhoods
and towns after the Feb. 15 dead-
line for Soviet withdrawal. ”Party

Monroeville site for

MONROEVILLE, Pa. (AP) —— A
five-month study for a suburban
Pittsburgh visitors bureau has
recommended the construction
of a $60 million complex that
would include a 20,000—seat are-
na, a convention center and a
hotel.

The study for the Monroeville
Convention and Visitors Bureau
said the region will be able to
support such a complex even
though Pittsburgh, 15 miles to the

Parlez-vous francais? If not, Lyon can be a lonely place

Entering the cafe in Lyon, I pre-

conversation.

MICHELE

The woman behind the coun-
ter smiled expectantly as I ap-
proached the register, pointed at
the hot chocolate machine and
showed her some French curren-
cy. She nodded.

As I waited, I felt like scream-
ing at her, ”Doesn’t anybody in
this city speak English?”

Instead, I remained quiet and
paid the woman, smiling in ap-
preciation for the steaming cup of

 

dark liquid.

For the first time in three
weeks, I was completely alone
without anyone to talk to.

In the other cities I had visited,
I had usually found another
American student or tourist dur-
ing the day to talk with about his
travels, but it was different in
Lyon.

I had arrived early on that cold.

January morning and spent my
first two hours in the city lugging
my rucksack around, trying to
find a place to stay.

I was only in Lyon for 24 hours

before I made my way back‘

toward England. I was tired of
traveling, almost out of French
francs, and I just wanted to find

A Call 624-PLAY for tickets and information up

a cheap hotel.

The hotel clerks sighed when
I smiled pitifully and said — in
English — that I couldn't speak
French. At each of the five hotels
I visited, my statement was an-
swered by a finger pointing at a
list ofrates, typed in English,
taped up on the wall.

I decided to stay at the sixth
hotel, realizing I wouldn't find an
inexpensive place to stay within
walking distance of the train
station.

The woman hotel attendant led
me up to a small room decorat-
ed in orange ~— orange curtains,
orange bedspread and orange
floral wallpaper.

Ater handing me a key, the
woman walked out of the room
— not even saying ”Have a nice
day” or ”Goodbye” in French.
Even though I probably wouldn't
have understood what she might
have said, I still missed the sound
of a human voice speaking to me.

I spent the first three hours of

the afternoon walking around the
city, wanting to spend the cold,
dreary day in a deep discussion
with someone in a cafe or a
museum.

Instead, I stared at the people
in the streets. Old men congregat-
ing on the corners, students rac-
ing around the empty fountain
and young women window
shopping — all of them carrying
on’ in an unintelligible hum.

THE PITT NEWS

PROVIDENCE, R.l. (AP) ~ Eric
Murdock’s strong second half car-
ried Providence up another step
in the Big East standings.

The sophomore guard scored
19 of his 21 points in the second
half Tuesday night as the Friars
beat Pittsburgh 88-78 to move
into a three—way tie for second in
the conference with Seton Hall
and Syracuse.

Murdock saw something even
more promising in the distance.

”This is very important; we
know if we win three more

games we'll be in the NCAAs,”
Murdock said.

There is no guarantee of that
but the Friars are 17-4 overall and
6-4 in the conference, two games
behind Georgetown.

Pittsburgh fell to 11-10 overall
and 4-6 in the league.

The Friars, who were chosen
ninth in a nine-team league by
the coaches in a preseason vot-
ing, led 38-27 at halftime behind
the shooting of Matt Palazzi, who
broke out of a two-game shoot-
ing slump that had seen him go

Wrestlers manhandle
Kent State with middle
lineup strength, 23-15

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

The Rolling Stones sang
Harlem Shuffle, comedian Robert
Townsend made a movie called
Hollywood Shuffle and last night,
the Pitt wrestling team did the
Panther shuffle.

Pitt's lineup was anything but
standard as they handed the Kent
State Golden Flashes a 23-15
defeat, to post the Panthers’
record at 9-2-1.

Defending national champion
Pat Santoro was unavailable for
action as he was wrestling Clari-
on University’s Mike Cole in the

annual East-West All-Star Classic’

last night.

As a result, Pitt started sopho-
more Boyd Hutchin at 118
pounds.

Pitt's usual 118 man, Bob
Simpson, moved all the way up
to the 134-pound division. Simp
son only wieghed about 130, ac-
cording to assistantcoach Stan
Mousetis.

Hutchin was pinned in the first
period by Kent State's Jack De-
Boe. Simpson, although he
almost pinned Kevin Pierson, lost
by a final score of 7-4.

Swimmers

Staff Writer

Trees Hall Pool will be splash-
ing all weekend as Pitt’s men’s
and women's swim teams defend
their Big East Championship
titles. . .

Competition begins Thursday
evening with the men's 3-meter
diving event, and ends on Sunday
evening with the men’s 400
freestyle relay.

Both teams have won the Big
East title for six consecutive years.
They are favored to make it seven
this year, despite the tough com-

petition they will be facing.

”lt’s very favorable that we'll-

win it,” said Pitt men’s coach
Dick Bradshaw. ”Vi|lanova will
be our toughest opponent, but I
think we're stronger depthwise.”
Pitt women's coach David Be-
lowich said that the women's
competition will look pretty
much like the men’s.

”Based- upon our dual meet‘
. record:-[;9-.1], wefshould be the

All the Panther switches did
produce some favorable results,
however.

Alan Utter, who went to the
NCAAS last year, wrestled at 142
for the absent Santoro and came
out with a 9-4 victory.

Panther Scott Hovan has re-
cently been placed back inthe
starting spot in the 150—pound di-
vision. Hovan, although his 23-8
record does not show it, has been
struggling for some time with his
confidence and with the flu.

Hovan pinned Golden Flash
Steve Houser at the 1:21 mark of
the first period. _

”I just needed a little confi-
dence booster. I was real sick
there for a while with the flu that
was going around,” Hovan said.

Matt Rizzo (126) has also fallen
victim to a confidence crisis as of
late.

However, Rizzo appears to be
well on his way to recovery as he
handed Jim Juskiw a 22-6 defeat,
thus winning a five-point techni-
cal fall team decision.

”I really needed that win
tonight. Lately, I've felt like I
couldn't beat a rug,” Rizzo said.

' ”I just tried to stop worrying so

favorites,” said Belowich. ”Our
depth will really kind of carry
us.”

The women's strongest compe-
tition will come from Boston Col-
lege, Villanova and Syracuse.

For the most part, the men only
have Villanova to look out for,
but Syracuse can also pose a
threat. _

A breakdown of the weekend
competitions, in order, are as
follows:

0 Thursday:

Event 1: Men's 3-meter diving
—- Pitt diving should dominate; it
should be a matter of what Pitt
diver will win. Pitt's Vernon Ye-
nick and John Sharkey will be the
favorites. Also look for Pitt's Brad
Butcher and Philip Cruz to
chaﬂenge.

cluding 3-of-5 from 3-point range.
Palazzi had 12 in the opening
half, one more than Abdul
Shamsid-Deen, who finished
with 13. A

”It was a good team effort in
the first half. We came out very
aggressively and played very pa-
tiently,” said first-year Providence
coach Rick Barnes.

Murdock then took over in the
second half scoring nine early
points as Providence took a

Providence does Pittin once again, 88-78

63-38 lead with 10 minutes to
play.

Pittsburgh got within 10 over
the next four minutes as Brian
Shorter scored 10 of his game-
high 27 points and Sean Miller
scored six points during the run.

Murdock then scored seven
points in 45 seconds to give the
Friars a 77-64 lead with 5:04 left.
The Panthers did not get closer
than 10 points the rest of the
game. a .

’’I wasn't looking for the shot

the first half,” Murdock said. ’’I
felt very confident in the second

half. I think we have to shoot very‘

well from the outside for things
to open up on the inside for our
big men.”

Event 3: Men's 200 medley re-
lay — This is a new event for the
men and should be an exciting
race. Pitt holds a big advantage
in the seed times and is the
favorite.

Event 4: Women's 500 free-
style — Christy Bridgewater from
Villanova is the definite favorite.
Pitt has four swimmers who can
be in the top five, including last-
year's champion Celeste Makiel.
Theresa Picklo, Tricia Rickert and
Liz Sari are Pitt's other threats.

Event 5: Men's 500 freestyle —
Villanova has the favorites in this
event. Chris Craft, a Villanova
senior, holds the Big East record
in the event and was last year's
Big East Championship swimmer
of the meet. Craft and Russ Stock-
man, from Villanova, are the top
seeds in the event. Pitt has three
of the remaining top eight; Dave
Schepner, Eric Daum and Fred
Constantini. .

and should be the favorite. Sha-~

right with Luciani to challenge.’
Pitt's Laura Lee Sullivan and Ka-
rin Masal could also challenge for
the top spot. Last year's champ in
the event, Syracuse's Cindy
Burke, is another one to look for.

Event 7: Men's 200 individual
medley — Once again it will
come down to Pitt and Villano-
va. Craft and Steve Petrie, both
from Villanova, hold the top two
seed spots. Matt Weist and John
Kesler from Pitt are the top
challengers.

Event 8: Women's 50 freestyle
—— This is one _ of the most
balanced events of the meet; the
top six seed times are separated
by just .4 seconds. Last year's

favorite. Pitt's Laure Walczakand

event. Look also for Pitt's Scott

Event 10: Women's 1-meter

7 has the favorites in the women's‘

diving events. Pi-tt’s Margie Pau-

each other for the top, spot. Con‘-

-5 The Lady Panthers hope to change their season around by heading out on the road.

"Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

Lady Panthers head out
on road; get ready to

face Providence tonight

Dec. 10, and several setbacks

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Pitt's women's basketball team
enters the toughest portion of its
season beginning tonight with a
contest at ..Providence College.

With the NCAA women's regu-
lar season winding down in the
next few weeks, Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce finds himself in the un-
enviable position of playing four
of his final six games on the road,
including three key Big East
matchups.

Worse yet, the Lady Panthers
must deal with the fact that they
watched an 8-1 start crumple
when the Big East schedule be-
gan. The squad currently sits at
10-11 overall (3-8 and in a tie for
last place in the conference).

”There’s some games looking
back, to be honest, that we
thought we could have won,”
Bruce said when asked whether
the extent of the damage to the
1988-89 season was due to.the
fact that Pitt had lost eight of its
first 11 conference games.

Bruce is referring to several crit-
ical Big East games that his team
was in but could not seem to
come out of victorious. included
among those was a close loss to
the second—p|ace team in the Big
East, Villanova, on the road last

' they shot 47 free throws to

such as Providence, Syracuse,
Georgetown and Villanova again

at home, where the tide could -

very easily have been turned.
”Aside from the first Connec-
ticut game [a 90-60 blowout to
the first-place squad on Jan, 7], I
think we had a chance to win all
those [conference] games,” Bruce
said. "At Villanova, our offense
was sputtering and they were
tough on their floor, but we still
had a chance. in the Providence
game we had 12 more points
from the field than they did,-but

12. « .

”Syracuse and Boston College
are two other games that could
have gone either way. I even
thought we had a chance to
come back in the Connecticut
game [the most recent contest the.
Lady Panthers have played, a
77-63 loss].”

Bruce thinks he might know
the reason for Pitt's dismal streak
after a scintillating opening to the
season, but the situation is almost
an impossible one for him‘ to
rectify. ' ' I, » '

’’I think everybody’s problem,
and it's not an easy thing to stop,
is that they have to relax,” he
said. ”That’s hard to do because
these Big East games are so cru-.
cial, but we need to find that hap-
py medium." « ‘

Swimmers to use OS U win as launching pad 0

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

It was business as usual for the
Pitt men's swimming team last
Friday when they traveled to
Columbus and defeated the Ohio

State Buckeyes, 161-139.

The Panthers won 10ofthe 16
events and never trailed,
although Ohio State remained

close until the end.

”They were ready. This is the
first time that we saw Ohio State
with a real strong lineup. In this
meet, with the different format
[16 events instead of 13], the kids
could swim four events instead of
three. We saw all of their good
swimmers in four of their regular
events, which presented a
stronger lineup than we anticipat-

ed,” said men's swimming coach
Dick Bradshaw, who tried to
keep Pitt swimmers in only two
or three events.

”We started out real strong, but A

they managed to keep hanging in
there with us by getting a lot of
seconds, thirds and fourth
places,” said Bradshaw.

Pitt opened the meet by win-
ning the 200-meter medley relay.

The team of Mike Kozlina, Mark
Dombroski, John Kesler and Scott
Jeffries finished in 1:35.07, one
second better than the nearest
Buckeye team.

Dave Schepner won the next
event, the 1,000 freestyle in a
time of 9:38.04. For the second
meet in a row, Schepner’s time
was the fastest ‘by a Panther in
that event this year.

Schepner also won the 500
freestyle in 4:43.79, again the
quickest time for Pitt this year.

The next Pitt victory was netted
by Mike Kozlina, the first of his
three individual victories, in the
100 backstroke.

Kozlina also won the 200 back-
stroke in 1:54.41 and the 100
butterfly in 50.04, an event in
which he was a late entry.

”The lineup that we prepared 1

against them was adequate, ex-
cept toward the end, I had to pull

. Kozlina and Matt Weist back into

an extra event in order to ensure
the victory,” said Bradshaw.
Pitt won the last two events to

cement that victory. Freshmen
Eric Mattson and Fred Constanti-
ni finished first and second with
times of 4:10.62 and 4:11.51
respectively.

”Our last two events were real-
ly strong. Both Fred and _Eric did
a fantastic job for this time of the
year,” said Bradshaw.

In the last event, the makeshift
team of Bill Folger, Jeffries, Kes-
ler and Tim Adams won the 200
freestyle relay in 1:24.59, almost
one second better than the closest
Buckeye team. A

For the first time this year, Pitt
did not win the two diving
events. However, Ohio State's
top diver is, according to. Brad-
shaw, one of the top eight in the
nation. ' V

’ John Sharkey finished second
in the 1-meter event and third in
the 3—meter, both Pitt bests. Ver-
non Yenick, who had won all but
one of the 3-meter events this
year, finished a disappointing
fourth, and also finished fifth in

points a game and 8.3 boards per
contest. She is supported by
guard Jennifer Shingler, who is
pouring in 12.0 points a contest,
and Connie Hurt (9.7). ‘

In order for Pitt to snap out of
this month-long slump, Bruce has
to hope for continued solid in-
dividual play from those players
plus some added team im-
provements.

”We’re still searchingfor ideas
that will make us better,” he stat-
ed. ”It’s our ability to carry out
each game plan that is probably

the most crucial thing. It's the

' girls’ job and my job to get to a
point where we feel we can beat '

each team we play.

”Specifically, I think we need .

to rebound better. We just can't

‘ beat a team on the boards once

in a while by one or two. We
have to get eight or nine more.

We also have to play better
defense late in the game, and‘
maybe run a little more and be .

more aggressive on offense.”

And even though all this is eas-
ier said than done, Bruce honest-
ly believes that his team can, and
must, win all of the remainingsix
contests in preparation for the
postseason Big East Tournament

to; be played March 2-5 at-‘Seton 

Hall.

”It’s not a situation where*ll:.'S,&lY
we have to win three of~thern”or_’
whatever,” he said. ”We warffto
win all of them — we neetfa
confidence-builder. I don't want
to finish eighth’ or ninth in the
conference. If we can finish
seventh, I'd take my chances on

us beating anyone in the tou_r- -

but I don't know if I can afford to
have that attitude this Saturday.”

Rizzo takes on Penn State's Jim
Martin (ranked third in the coun-
try), a formidable foe considering
Martin is the returning NCAA
champ at 126 pounds.

”I’m not intimidated. In fact,
I’m looking fon/vard to wrestling

0 him. He puts his pants on just like

I do," Rizzo said.

After Panther Perry Miller won
his match to put the score at
23-12, Pitt defaulted its
heavyweightlohn Owens. Pitt is
saving all its strength for the Nit-
tany Lions Saturday night.

Kent State Coach Ron Gray,
whose squad upset the Panthers
last season, said he was simply
outmatched.

”We only beat Pitt last year be-
cause we got all the breaks.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Pitchers
John Franco of the Cincinnati
Reds and Bob Kipper of the
Pittsburgh Pirates avoided ar-
bitration Tuesday by agreeing
to one—year contracts, reduc-
ing the the players in arbitra-
tion to 32.

Franco, who lost in arbitra-
tion last year, settled with the
Reds for $1,067,500, a raise of
$392,500.

He was 6-6 last season with
a league-leading 39 saves and

To avoid arbitration,
Kipper and Franco sign

a 1.57 earned—run average.

Franco had asked for $1.3
million and the Reds had
offered $950,000.

Kipper agreed to a one—year
deal for $230,000, a $105,000
raise.

Kipper was 2-6 with a 3.74
ERA last season in 50 relief ap-
pearances. He had asked for
$295,000 and the Pirates
offered $185,000. He can earn
an additional $135,000 in

bonuses.

”Santoro was out and Pitt
defaulted a number of times, so
they basically gave us 12 points.

”Pitt has a better team, that's all
there is to it. I don't think we
wrestled badly for our level, con-

scholarships and Pitt has 11.”

Phil Cruz finished third in the
1-meter, equaling his best posi-
tion this year.

”Phil did a real good job tak-
ing third, splitting up John and
Vernon; he keeps getting better
after each meet,” said Bradshaw.

This weekend, Pitt competes in
the Big East Championships at
Trees Pool, and Bradshaw said

that the win against Ohio State
will help the team for that meet.

”Our times were good for this
meet; they were excellent for not
shaving. We're continuing to
progress. It should take us into
the Big East with a real positive
look.
