Comment, an original ballet about the Pittsburgh Inter-
national Exhibit of Art, willbe rebroadcast Sunday at 6 p.m.
on television Channel 13, WQED. The program, which pre-
miered Monday, was created by and features Mrs. Jeanne
Beaman, a dance instructor at the University.

The performance displays a new concept of visual com-
mentary carried out by the television director and the chore-

ographer. The idea for the ballet
was developed by Jay Rayvid,
WQED program manager who
won a $1,000 Reader’s Digest
Foundation Award for the sta-
tion. Pianist and composer Rich-
ard Russell wrote the music for

the production and also plays the .

piano and percussion instruments
in the program.

The ballet will be seen all over
the country this winter. It praca

this problem.
Dr. Corn points to the Cathe-
A -dral of Learning as an example
’ of the less dramatic effects of
‘pollution. The’ Cathedral is built
of Indiana limestone, which is a
very light gray material. The
stone has been turning black
over the years, however, as the
result of dense smoke and chemi-
cals released into the air by
heavy industry in the area cou-
' pled with the weather that char-
acterizes Pittsburgh.
The problem in visibility has
cleared up somewhat, but haze
and fog still create visual dif-
ﬂculties in the city's numerous
. valleys. Many of the air pollu-
tions’ processes are invisible to
the eye, however, and do not of-
fend the nose. Rain water, for
instance, picking up pollutants
from the air, may disintegrate
stone just beneath the surface,
causing ﬂaking.
Metals corrode faster where
there is air pollution. In Chicago
it was alsofound that dust pol-
. luted with sulphuric acid caused
runs in the nylon stockings of
thousands of office girls; fabrics
fade, soot destroys paint, electric
contacts are deterred by corro-
8i011. Plants are damaged, "and
human beings and animals suffer
from respiratory ailments due to
air pollution.

There are two types of air pol-

  Professor Studies Air
By MARIE KUKICH ,
, The supply of air that we can breathe is exhaustible;
‘yet air is essential for survival.

, Dr. Morton Corn, assistant professor of air pollution
for the Graduate School of Public Health, is trying to study

lution, oxidizing and reducing.

Smog resulting from surplus oxy-
gen is an example of the oxidiz-

- ing type. In reduction, which is

Pittsburgh's main problem, air
pollution is often caused by the
older type fossil fuels such as
coal or oil creating a surplus of
sulphur dioxide or other chemi-
cals in the air.

Air pollution is essentially the
result of the micrometeorology
and geography of the city. Each
city's problem is, therefore, uni-
que. In Pittsburgh smog or even
a slight haze is caused by stagna-
tion of the air. This is called an
“inversion.”

“If we shut up 15 people all
smoking cigarettes in a room and
turn off the ventilation, also clos-
ing all windows and doors, a
comparable situation would oc-
cur,” Dr.~ Corn explained.

What goes into the .air must

come down, although it may not’

come down until it has traveled
100 to 150 miles away. It is im-
possible to tell whether damage
to a tomato plant, for instance,
is caused by air pollution without
help from special research in the
area. ‘ ' A

Moreover, a speciﬁc factory
cannot be sued for polluting the
air because pollution is a com-
bination of various particles re-
leased into the air.

U. of Ala. Administration
Cancels Armstrong Show

— A decision by the Uni-
versity of Alabama adminis-
tration to prevent entertain-
er Louis Armstrong from
appearing on campus has
met with strong student ob-
jection.
The administration had “ad-
vised” a student organization not
_ to contract with Armstrong, a Ne-
gro, for an appearance at the
organizations Festival of Arts in
February. The university admin-
istration denied that its decision
,  had anything to do with race.
 '.v. As a result of the incident,
" which attracted national atten-
tion when it was reported in the
student newspaper, the Crimson-
White, the Alabama student gov-
ernment unanimously passed a
resolution asking that “the ad-
ministration repeal its ban on
the appearance of Louis Arm-
strong and his All Stars.”

A student group circulated a
petition requesting that Arm-
strong be allowed to appear, but
later withdrew it on grounds that
“due to the distortions of the
controversy by the national news
medias, (it) could do nothing but

_ harm the university.”

The group said that its orig-
inal decision to petition “had

 

 

 
    
 

nothing‘ to do’ with the racial
issue, but was a protest against

- the administration depriving the

students of seeing the renowned
entertainer.”

“We dropped the petition,” a
group spokesman said, “not be-
cause our feelings about want-
ing the entertainer on campus
have changed, but because the
original purpose of the petition
had become distorted by the ra-
cial implications which the na-
tional news medias" have placed
on the controversy.”

Exactly what role——if any—the
question of race had in the inci-
dent was unclear. The univer-
sity administration issued a state-
ment denying that Armstrongs
race had anything to do with the
decision not to have him appear,
but it did not offer any explana_
tion for its action.

The statement said “The ad-
ministration of the University of
Alabama advised the student Co-
tillion Club not to contract with
101115 Armstrong for an appear.
ance in February.

DR. MORTON CORN. assistant professor of air pollution for the Grad-
uate School of Public Health, is presently conducting a study of the
problems and effects of air pollution. Air pollution is essentially the
result of micrometeorology and geography of the city.

An “air pollution scientist” is
a combination of an engineer,
chemist, physicist, and physiolo-
gist. University researchers work-
ing with Dr. Corn, including Dr.
Felix Stein, who attempts to de-
termine the density of air pollu-
tants, and Dr. Lawrence De-
tants for chemical content, are
seeking to prevent future ‘harm-
ful effects.

To obtain a readable sample
of the air, the University re-
searchers have constructed a “set-
tling chamber,” which collects

dust particles on the roof of the
school. The quantities dealt with
however, are so minute that it

takes two weeks for each sam-
pling-

One particle to one millionth
or even. one billionth part of air
is often considered pollution. Dr.

On Mentor

Training Set

Helen Pool Rush, dean of
. students, will meet with fe-
male students interested in
becoming mentors on Jan.
25 and 26, at 4 p.m. and on
Jan. 27 at 5 p.m. in 1228 CL.
Applications will be handed out.

At the meeting Dean Rush will
discuss the duties of a mentor
which include meeting once a
week for an hour with a group
of freshman women during their
ﬁrst three months to help them
out with problems and to answer
any questions they may have con-
cerning the University.

The selection of mentors is
based on scholarship, maturity,
good citizenship, leadership abil-
ity, service, and interest in
others, as shown by one’ overall
record.

The ﬁnalists will be chosen
after the grades of this trimester
are received. Dean Rush is initia-
ating the selection process at this
time, however, so that interested
students will be able to attend
the week-long training session
beginning Aug. 23. Last year
more than 150 girls applied from
which 57 were chosen.

A girl must be a mentor before
or during the time she is a sen-
ior assistant. '

Corn and his colleagues also work _

closely with a special Allegheny
County committee which attempts
to control industrial pollution of
air. However, they have little
legal power.

Dr._ Corn, who received his
Ph.D. in engineering and applied
physics from Harvard University,
is concerned “with mankind's fu-
ture." What would we do if we
couldn’t breathe the air that we
live in? We are not as immor-
tal as .we think.

Summer Employment  
Available in Germany

Students interested in seeking summer employment in
Germany may now obtain applications, according to the
Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange.

Both male and female students may apply for unskilled
labor positions on Germany farms, where they wﬂl general-
ly be treated as one of the family. Other occupations avail-
able include factory, hotel -and restaurant work. Students

proﬁicient in German may seek
jobs as waiters and waitresses,
although there is little possibil-
ity for reception positions.

Opportimities for hospital work
abound for medical students. The
Office emphasized, however; that
students will not be able to ob-
tain skilled positions, e.g. office
workers, interpreters, guides, as-
sistant teachers.

A “standing room only”
audience had the opportun-
ity Sunday afternoon to hear
a truly responsive orchestra
play an excellent work un-
der the direction of ‘an ex-
citing conductor. The Work
was the Ravel orchestration of
the “Pictures at an Exhibition”

_, by Moussorgsky; the conductor

was John Pritchard and the or-
chestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony.

In the “Pictures” there oc-
curred one of those all-too-rare
musical events in which the con-
ductor was perfectly able to com-

. municate his wishes to his or-

chestra and in which his orches-
tra was perfectly able to trans-
form them into sound.

As treated by Ravel, the Mous-
sorgsky “Pictures” are an ex-
ceedingly diﬁicult set of vignettes
worthy of a virtuoso orchestra;

‘on Sunday afternoon the Pitts-

burgh A Symphony proved itself
one of the world's ﬂnest.

Pritchard is an extremely care-
ful musician, choosing his orches-
tral colors and dynamics with a
sensitivity that places him apart
from the rank-and-ﬁle of his col-
leagues. He does not ‘make the
“Great Gate of Kiev” roar the
way Reiner or Toscanini did, but
Pritchard‘s own special gift for
the correct phrasing imparts‘ to
a grandeur that this listener has
never before heard in the “Great
Gate.”

Unfortunately, all of the con-

.cert did not achieve this level.

For Van Cliburn, the person for
whom this “standing room only”
audience had ‘gathered, was no-
ticeably lacking in artistic acuity.
His playing was insensitive and
clumsy, his phrasing was vir-
tually non-existent, and his use
of the damper pedal could be
considered didactic only if he was
trying to show how not to use
it.

tation toward the Macbowell

“Concerto” seemed to indicate
that he thought of the work as
one for solo piano with orches-
tral accompaniment rather than
one for’ piano and orchestral to-
gether. This, however, would
seem to be more the fault of the
composer, for MacDowe1l does
not quite seem to understand
how to integrate completely the
piano and orchestra.

For an encore, Cliburn played
the Chopin “Polonaise in A-min-
or” to which he imparted a sound
too much like Rachmaninoff to

sound like authentic Chopin.’

Furthermore, his piano‘ had a
particularly tight, dry sound -
even for a Steinway — so that
his base and treble tones had
much the same quality.

When it was announced in dorm council reports Sunday night that women resi-
. A dents should start picking their roommates and suitemates for the spring term and next
 fall, many juniors turned to each other in confusion. The proposal that senior women be
allowed to live off campus is still on the table, and a ﬁnal decision here would be a
 i determining factor in many juniors’ plans.
' ‘ According to the report, applications will not be out until the middle of February,
. ; then due within a week or ten days. But planning starts now, and the uncertainty as to
5 u the outcome of this proposal could cause several complications.
‘, First of‘ all, most of the women live in suite set-ups where picking a roommate
._ extends beyond one‘ person: suites may include as many as six women and most fre-
.f quently are arranged with an eye to total compatibility by the women themselves. Thus,
' for example, if six girls decide to live together, and one senior later finds that she can
 »move to an apartment, either the other ﬁve must ﬁnd a replacement, which would be
S difficult since the other women would have made their own suite arrangements, they
 would be placed in a suite smaller than theone they had originally chosen, or the head
i ‘ resident would select another roommate for them. A
‘ Seniors who have lived in one dormitory also have preference for which rooms or
_ suites they want over underclassmen or women moving in from other dormitories, not
 1- to mention the confusion that could arise when sororities decide which of their mem-
917. V bers. will be living in the sorority suite or house, which frequently involves a large num-

ber of senior women. ..

_ Thus no junior woman who would be interested in living off campus if this pro-
posal were passed can make deﬁnite plans for living arrangements next year. And the

1 V  head. resi ents who map out the plans -must h ave deﬁnite commitmentsfrom these women.

If no decision is made on this proposal within the month, it might as well be shelved

  
 

According to Emmanuel

j Mounier, the point of the
 ‘existential method is to urge
' people to a more thoughtful
" approach to life by remind-

ing them that they are, as
individuals, inextricably in-
volved in the affairs of the

 , world, and that to deny this,
 by talking frivolously of

serious things is an act of
bad faith. Existentialism, if
taken properly, would re-
press the superﬁcial pass-

” ‘ words which are used. to

_ i avoid serious thinking, or
L not to thing at all, and en-
, j courage people to an attitude

where they can at least exist

 for themselves as individ-
- uals, and perhaps even exist

responsibly for others.
Jean -Paul Sartre, as the

 . best known representative of
’ the existential bias, has suf-
; . fered perhaps more than any
. other contemporary thinker

by the very opposite of this
tendency, i.e., ‘idle talk. The
discussion padded out by Pe-

 . ter Horn in two articles ap-
 ‘ pearing in The Pitt News

(Dec. 11 and 14) reminds me

 very much of this.

In these articles, Mr. Horn

V I has not revealed very much

about Sartre, and in fact,

 I while reading the articles,

one wishes that Mr. Horn

» would -at least make an at-

tempt to relate -his own ideas

. ‘to the philosophy of Sartre. .
, Setting up a series of straw -

men —Heraclitus, the ideal

 ' philosopher, and Sartre him-
 . , self—Mr. Horn’s quasi-pla-

tonic predisposition attrib-

gutes them with any qualities _
_ which favor his wish to con-
demn, and we are supposed
‘to believe he is talking abou

 existentialism!‘ ' 

     

A. MORE MINUTE analy-
sis of Sartre’s text might re-
veal the contradictions that
Mr. Horn implies in his ar-
ticle, “At Variance with
Himself,” but as it is, we
must accept implicitly Mr.

Horn’s assertion without un-
derstanding the grounds for
it. Besides, the Sartre who
turned down the Nobel Prize
is by no means obliged to
be the Sartre who wrote Be-
ing and Nothingness. Any
Nobel nominee could have
turned down the Prize for
the same reasons as Sartre,
and we would not have
doubted his good faith.

Actually, what has Sartre
got to do with Heraclitus?
Nothing. Moreover, what has
Sartre got to do with a critic
who seems to be better ac-
quainted-with his public-im-
age than with his dialectics ?
Answer: nothing again. In

short, as long as the author
of these two articles substi-
tutues prejudice for knowl-
edge, he himself risks being
a not-hingness.

I do not take strong ex-
ception to Mr. Horn’s partic-
ular statements because he
is trying to be a pure intel-
lectual. This does not come
off well in such a statement
that “we admire Sartre’s de-
cency and humanism when
he affirms freedom, action,
and responsibility in the ab-
stract.” It is the voice of a
sick liberal who supports
freedom, action, and respon-
sibility but uses abstract
thought as an excuse to do
nothing. Surely it would be
more graceful to add that
we admire Sartre’s ideas not
only in the abstract but
when applied to particular is-
sues as well. The f‘secret” of

B Sartre’s success is precisely

his .n5»€¢ti0nj .0.f.- existential

  
  

.;_i_,ﬁ_i_-fl‘-gfor a year, because contracts through the winter of 1966 -will be released by the end of
 V February.’ We would hope that the need for organized housing‘ plans would mean immedi-
 -ate attention.to this proposal. ’ ‘

idea into the daily case and
into special situations be-
tween human beings. His in-
fluence picks up force main-
ly because Sartre, as a per-
son, has made the committ-

ﬁtment. This is one thing about
=Sartre that is worthy of ad-

miration-—just as it is in the
case of Bertrand Russell
and Albert Schweitzer who
are actively involved with
men as well as with ideas.

THE AUTHOR’S disre-
gard for Sartrian existen-
tialism gives way to naive
misinterpretation. Horn at-
tacks the ideas of subversiim
a n d irrationality without
realizing that he is dealing
with mere publicity. Subver-
sion is the criminal connota-
tion of revolution, and is
easy to deride as such. It im-
plies that Sartre’s committ-
ments taken for ethical rea-
sons, are in realty the acts
of an outlaw,and that if he
set foot in America he could
be . arraigned before the
House un-American Activity
Committee. Horn does not
react like a cheap lawyer
pleading a kidnapping case,
but. his digust with destruc-

tive negativity bears no lu-
cid connection to Sartre.

Not informed of -the whole
existential equation, Horn
allows himself to be frankly

anti - existentialist without.

knowing it. The existential
leap involves a rejection of
abstraction as a source of
values in favor of individual
singularity, yet Horn com-
ments: “. . . that philosophy
must deal only with ‘con-
creteness” presupposes that
concrete situations have
meaning apart fro abstract-
ed values and conceptual
frameworks.” Certainly, cer-
tainly, Mr. Horn is simply re-

“Essence predeeds existence."
Later Hornsays, “The con-
temporary philosopher func-
tions not simply" as a world-
machine ‘creator, but labors
rather toward the end of
uniting different forms of
experience.” It is not just
my personal prejudice that
I am not interested in a phi-
losopher who takes himself
for God, and yet proceeds in
his work like a novelist. Be-
sides, world-creation—-from
Socrates’ “Know thyself” to
Kierkegaard’s curse of He-
gel——has been banned from
the list of philosophical ac-'
tivities. And Sartre is not
the only thinker who has re-
jected it in turn.

OTHER AESURDlTIES—
but unfortunately not of a
philosophical nature--found
in Mr. Horns discussion are
the following: “He (the phi-
losopher) must establish cri-

   

    

    

 science

    

haps so, but in what way is
Sartre lacking in criteria?
We must accept this state-
ment of Horn’s on good faith
alone. Again: “He must have
a sense of discipline, and be
willing to admit of errors,
including, at times, those of
subjectivity.” Bravo. Valu-
able counsel for someone in
the earlier stages of learn-
ing, -but if a philosopher
counts change wrong once in
a while who expects him to

agree that his subjectivity

is to blame?

Sartrian existentialism is
aimed at tearing people away

from vital sleep and a false
sense of security gained by
refusing, personal engage-
ments. Thus “subversion” as
Mr. Horn points out accur-
ately is not the ultimate job‘
of just the philosopher, but
of anyone who chooses to
have a soul, i.e., creative con-

Junior Wins Every Event Entered

Panthers Lose to lMountaineers;
Maphis, Camp Spark Winners

By FRANK SMIZIK.
The hot shooting of Moun-
taineers Bill Maphis and Bob
Camp in the second half en-

abled West Virginia to down
the Panthers here, 86- 72.
Maphis ﬁnished the game
with 25 points and Camp hit for
18.

The Panthers were in the
game until Camp started hitting
on long shots from about 20 feet
and it sparked the Mountaineers
to a 16 point lead with only three
minutes to go.

“We were giving Camp the out-
side shot the whole game,” said
Panther Coach Bob Timmons.
“We just didn’t expect a guy that
tall (six-foot-eight) to have such
a shot and-he put it in at the
right time.” _

Maphis had 15 of his points the
ﬁrst half and scored seven of the
Mountaineers ﬁrst nine points.
“He was supposed to have an in-
jured back, but it didn’t hamper
him,” said Timmons.. “He al-
ways seems to have a good game
against us.”

The hot shooting would have
normally buried the Panthers ear-
lier, but the Panthers played one
of their best games this season.
Dave Blyshak came of the bench
to score 17 points. It was his abil-
ity to make long jump shots that
kept the Panthers in the game
when leading scorers Bob Lovett
and Larry Szykowny weren’t hit-
ting.

“I used Blyshak because we
were giving away too much
height with Fisher in there. The
guards were th_ree or four inches
taller than Brian and they were
shooting over him. I also kept
him in the game because he was
shooting well,” said Timmons.

“I’ll probably use Blyshak
whenever the team has guards as

By TOM SACKS

The gymnastic team has in-
sured itself for the long, rough
season ahead with two quick vic-
tories in its ﬁrst two meets —
Slippery Rock, 70-50, and Mass-
achusetts, 66lé-5l% —- Saturday
and Monday mainly on the ef-
forts of junior Dave McKinnis.

In both meets he has taken
ﬁrst place in the six events he
entered."‘I expected that he’d be
one of the better boys,” said
coach Warren Neiger. “He’s cer-
tainly been doing the ultimate
for us. He settled on his routine
early in practice and he's been

That’s the only way for a smart
competitor.”

The long horse W35 the 0111)’
event in which the gymnasts did-
n’t capture ﬁrst place, yielding
to Massachusetts’ Roy Cohen.
Close behind him was Ig Perez.
The other sophomore on the
team, Jim Sacco, won the all-
around event, including the top
spot on the parallel bars.

“Sacco and Perez showed deﬁ-
nite improvement in this meet.
even though they only had two
days to practice from the last
meet,” said Neiger. “The team’s

over-all performance came up
from the Slippery Rock meet.”

Tom Misage received the high-
est rating on the horizontal bar
and Gary Barr won the tram-
polining event for the Panthers’
other ﬁrst place ﬁnishings.

“The trampoline still looks
pretty bad,” said Neiger. “Since
it’s such a new event the caliber
of competition is still pretty
poor.”

The gym team goes on the road
for the next month on what will
probably be its hardest stretch
of the season.

enski ineligible because of schol-
astic diﬂiculties and Roth Mc-
Nally hobbled witha bad knee I
have to go with Blyshak who is
usually a forward.”

Timmons also changed the Pan-
thers defensive tactics that have
been the trademarks of the Pan-
ther teams of past years. The
Panthers usually use a pressing
type defensethat forces the other
team into mistakes. Against West
Virginia, however, they played a
ball control game and a zone
defense.

“When I you have to go with i

the small amount of players that
I have,” said Timmons, “It’s im-
possible to play an aggressive
type game and have your team
last. If we would have pressed
West Virginia with their speed
they could have easily gone over
a hundred points.”

The loss gives the Panthers a
3-6 record and marks the ﬁrst
time the Panthers have lost to
the Mountaineers in four games.
They won both games of the tra-
ditional home and home series
last year.

WVU Frosh Trounce Cubs;
Ron Williams Leads Attack

West Virginia University’s freshman basketball team

rolled to its twelfth consecutive victory of the season Mon-
day night defeating Pitt’s freshman team, 108-79. Coach

Quentin Bamette’s “dream team” now has a 12-0 record  _
with seven remaining games.

Ron Williams, a 6-foot, 3-inch, 190-pound guard, led the
Mountaineers with 24 points, 22 rebounds and 12 assists.

Williams comes from Weirton,
West Virginia, where he led his
team to the state championship
and was named a high school
all-America.

His 24 points was the highest
for both teams, but is the lowest
total he has had this season. Wil-
liams leads the team with a 31
point average, and also leads in
rebounds.

The well-balanced Mounties
also had ﬁve other players in
double ﬁgures. Norm Hohnes and
Darrel Dillenback had 19 and 14
points, respectively, whﬂe Let-
cher Humphries and center Dick
Penrod. netted 10 each.

not return. Heavyweight Bill

 

Return Helps
Coach Peery

By BILL CABIN
For the ﬁrst time in a
month, the wrestling team
has good news. Mike John-
son is back.

Johnson had a knee opera-
tion to remove excess carti-
lage five weeks ago, and was
not expected to rejoin the team
until February. This week, how-
ever, Johnson is almost fully re-
covered and he may wrestle at

Syracuse this Saturday.

“He’s been okayed by the doc-
tor,” said coach Rex Peery, “and
he’ll begin wrestling either this
week or next week.” This means
Johnson will only be missing two
meets, instead of the four Peery
anticipated.

Johnson's reliability gives the
depthless matmen some stability.
He won the 130-pound title and
was named the outstanding
wrestler in last year's Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling tourna-
ment. He has also compiled a

Back at 191.

25-3-2 record in his two years of
varsity wrestling.

Bill Beck also rejoins the team
this week in an attempt to bols-
ter a weakness in the heavier
weights. The matmen still lack
depth in the 191 and heavy-
weight divisions, having only
Beck and Bill Bodle.

The matmen started the year
with bad news. Three. good
heavyweights from last year did

 

Swimmers Face Long Year; 

Coach Grady Rebuilds Team

Four of the swirmning team’s opponents were ranked
in the nation’s Top Ten in pre-season pools. The swimmers
have lost to sixth ranked Army 63-31, and must meet second
ranked Indiana, ninth ranked Michigan State, tenth ranked
Wisconsin, and NCAA Small-College Champion, Bucknell.

Coach Ben Grady must also face inexperience this sea-
son with only 14 varsity swimmers, eight of them sopho-
mores. Grady called this a. rebuilding year and the team’s
ﬁrst two losses to Army and Maryland validate his prophecy.
Although the score of the two meets was almost identical,
the swimmers showed an improvement against the Terra-

pins. Diver Don Hahnfeldt who ‘finished ﬁrst against the

Cadets, didn’t repeat his per-
formance at Maryland but the
Panthers won the 400-yard free
style relay in addition to ﬁnish-
ing second and third in the last
ﬁve events. Relays count seven
points for ﬁrst while individual
events count ﬁve points for first
place, three for second, and one
‘for third.

Coach Grady still follows his
policy of not telling his swim-
mers what they are going to
swim until the meet. “I know
Pm going to swim a free style
event but this makes me plan for
all the events,” said sophomore
Mike Olesak. “I think its a good
idea.” said Bill Fitzgerald, “. . .
because I concentrate on the
Whole meet and not on any one
event.”

' Grady has thus far switched
from last year's 200-yard swims
in practices to swims of 100
yards. Due to the Christmas lay-
off, when it was hard to schedule
practices because many of the
swimmers went home, Grady is
trying to rebuild the team.

Buchanan and Tim Gay, a 167-
pounder, had academic trouble.
George Radman, the top sopho-
more prospect, transferred to
Michigan State.

Gay placed third in the East-
erns and sixth in the Nationals
while wrestling in 157 pounds
in 1963. John Carr, a 157 pound. , b
er, transfered to Wilkes College. 
and Dave Clery, at 137 pounds,
went to Oklahoma University.

Despite the teturn of Johnson
and Beck, another loss was in-
curred as sophomore Terry Sulli-
van withdrew from school. Sulli-
van was one of the team’s most
promising sophomores, and he
was runner-up in the 130-pound
division of the P.I.A.A. Cham-

“We’re hurting,” said coach
Peery, “and we can’t afford any
injuries, especially in the heavier
weights.” The matmen’s weak-
ness in the 191 and heavyweight
divisions could be crucial in Sat-
urday’s meet at Syracuse.

The Orangemen have Gary
Everling, a 191-pounder, and Jim
Nance, a heavyweight, two of the
best wrestlers in the East.

L
HARVARD UNIVERSITY
Graduate School of Business Administration

Jim Brown, Northwestern University, '62, came
with Western Electric because he had heard about
the Company's concern for the continued develop-
ment of its engineers after college graduation.

Jim has his degree in industrial engineering and
is continuing to learn and grow in ’ professional
stature through Western'Electric's Graduate Engi-
neering Training Program. The objectives and edu-
cational philosophy of this Program are in the best
of academic traditions, designed for both experi-
enced and new engineers.

Like other Western Electric engineers, Jim
started out in this Program with a six-week course
to help in the transition from the classroom to
industry. Since then, Jim Brown has continued to
take courses that .will help him keep up with the
newest englneeringtechniques in communications.

This training, together with formal college
engineering studies, has given Jim the ability to
develop his talents to the fullest extent His present
responsibilities include the solution of engineer-
ing problems in the manufacture of moly-permal-

~ loy core rings, a component used to improve the

quality of voice transmission.
