Communication top SGB goal

Zachariah Blott

Managing Editor

Among their campaign goals,
many Student Government Board
candidates last November said
they wanted to improve commu-

munication, the 1998 board made
other promises to the student body
about its goals.

Byron Woodson said he
wished to increase minority reten-
tion rates. Mark Murphy said he

Hudac, letting out a laugh. He
explained that he just wants stu-
dents to notice what the SGB
does.

In addition to improved com-

members and president have been
in oﬂice for over three months, the
students who elected these oili-
cials are probably wondering
what campaign promises were
followed through with, and which

   
    

were pipe dreams that sounded
good.

COMMUNICATION

VV1th the goal of improved
communication being a staple of
last election’s campaign promises,
the board has had a slow begin-
ning, but is prepared for the next
semester.

“We’re going to be much
more active at communicating in
the fall,” said board President
Alyson Wallach.

Hudac, who is responsible for
setting up Town Hall Meetings
once a month, said he’ll use
“much more aggressive and inter-
esting strategies” next semester to
get students to the meetings.

He mentioned riding campus
shuttles to tell students about the
meetings and the ﬁre stunt as his
only concrete ideas right now, but
added he’ll be coming up with
some new tactics over the sum-
mer. His ﬁrst two Town Hall

CIS employee found dead, l

Tuesday, 14 April 1998

falsely reported as ianitor

Brett Taylor

Assistant News Editor

A Katz Graduate School of
Business computer analyst found
dead in the third ﬂoor men’s restroom
at Mervis Hall Thursday died of a
blood clot in his lung, according to
the Allegheny County coroner’s
office.

John Lundberg, 45, was found in
the men’s room at 11:30 p.m. by a
security guard and pronounced dead
at 11:40 p.m., according to Joe

from the county coroner’s office.
Frank Miller, for whom Lundberg

worked, said the analysts work ﬂexi-
ble schedules —— coming and going as
needed between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. -
so he didn’t know how long Lundberg
had been missing.

The Pitt News, based on informa-
tion provided by Pitt spokesman Ken
Service, wrongly reported yesterday

that Lundberg was a maintenance

worker. He was actually a full-time
computer analyst at Katz Business
school.

His body was removed from the
Mervis Hall at 1:35 a.m. Lundberg
died of natural causes, according to
Dominick.

Anti-semite says Jews are
responsible for Holocaust

Around the World

MOSCOW — An ultra-nationalist in
Moscow claims Jews are to blame for start-
ing World War II and provoking the
Holocaust. » 4

Vladimir Zl1irinovsky’s anti—sernitic
comments have drawn international con-
demnation for years.

Sunday he said, “Ihe essence of the
conﬂict around the Jewish people is that
when their number grows too much in some
country, war breaks out there.” He added,
“That happened in Germany.”

Arabbi at the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center says the comments are a
slap in the face to Jewish victims. He has
called on Russia’s political and Orthodox
church leaders to reject the statements.

Asked why he made his remarks now,
Zhirinovsky said: “Many Jews were born in

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —— A
second replica of the Titanic is in the works.
RMS Titanic’ Shipping Holdings of
South Africa plans to send its vessel on its
maiden voyage December 29, 1999.

There is no word on the cost. But the
company’s public relations firm says the
replica will be built to the exact speciﬁca-
tions of the original ocean liner but with such
modern amenities as air conditioning and
satellite TV.

The South Aﬁican ﬁrm is the second to
announce a Titanic replica. A U.S.—Swiss
partnership is spending $500 million to build
a steamer that will travel from Southampton,
England, to New York City in April 2002.

The original ship cost $10 million. It
sank on its maiden voyage in April, 1912.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland —- A
Protestant minister in Northern Ireland
marked Easter by urging worshippers to ‘

pray that a historic peace agreement will last

The Rev. Jack Shearer said the best way

friend

But outside of church, that Easter spirit
of reconciliation was missing among those
who feel betrayed by the deal. The plan calls
for establishing a formal link between
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic —
while keeping the province ﬁnnly tied to
Britain.

One Catholic woman called the deal a
‘‘sell—out’’ because Sinn Fein settled for less
than a united Ireland. She had been a long-
time supporter of the IRA—Allied party but
now has joined an extremist party that has no
ceaseﬁre.

Across the Nation

UNDATED — The tobacco industry is
squaring off against lawnrakers and Clinton
administration officials on the “Sunday
Talks Show.”

Phillip Morris Sr. Vice President Steven
Parrish said a bill working its way through
the Senate would give the FDA “unbridled
authority” to ban cigarette sales and could
bankrupt the industry.

Lead tobacco negotiator J. Philip
Carlton put it in even stronger terms, saying
the goal is to put the tobacco industry out of
business.

But Senate committee chairman John
McCain disagreed He also defends efforts
to move ahead on legislation without the
industry’s support, saying the cigarette mak-
ers no longer have veto power.

White House adviser Rahm Emanuel

acknowledges the administration is taking a

political risk by taking on one of the nation’s
most powerful special interest groups. But
he says it’s essential to snuff out teen smok-
ing.

“Students are more likely to read a

OUSING

Another area that many candidates
touched on last fall was housing.
p Some candidates, such as Murphy,
wanted to get answers for students about
 Sutherland Hall overcrowding. Others, like
[Elizabeth Klein, hoped to pressure Pitt into
‘building a new residence hall. I
p So far, the board has only reached the
linformationgathering stage of the propos-

als. Wallach said she and Murphy attended
a meeting with ﬂie departments of Housing
{and Property Management to discuss
‘ Sutherland’s and other housing issues.
“Our agenda was just to ﬁnd out
what’s happening,” said Wallach. “We
think this is important before making sug-
*\ gestions.”
Murphy and Ken O’Shaughnessy, of
Property Management, were not available
i for comments.
E Kelly Meyers was another board
, member who campaigned for more

 University—owned housing. She said the
3 board’s effect is on a “level of input, help-

ing to cry to the administrators for the stu-
dents.”

INDIVIDUAL GOALS

Most of the current board members set
individual goals that have not seen fruition
yet. In most cases the individual members

.. he aCCOm- make SGB announcements in the WPU lobby. “We’Ve had
plishments or

several prelirni—
nary conversations about [the programs] so
far,” he said. “Once things get started, he’ll
be in the loop.”

Michael Friedberg campaigned that
student life at night needs to be addressed,
possibly including a 24-hour eatery and
video store on campus.

Since then, he’s become a member of
the University Senate’s Libraries
Committee and is working toward a more
accommodating library. He’s trying to
extend I-Iillman’s Sunday night hours until
2 am. The building is currently open until
midnight.

“Most students procrastinate so this
should be looked at,” he said.

Also, he is working toward keeping it
open until Friday of ﬁnals week, not just
Wednesday, as it is now.

In addition, he is hoping to set up a

leadership class at Pitt to help train students

as leaders. He’s talked with a few vice
chancellors and vice provosts about this
possibility.

“He set up a meeting about this with

us,” said Bob Gallagher, interim—vice chan— ‘

cellor for Student Affairs. “I’m enthusiastic
about the initiative he’s shown.”

Since some of the board’s campaign
goals are clearly not going to come true,
many of the board members have shifted
their efforts toward more feasible ends.

“My goals for gargoyles were crushed
very early on,” said Hudac, who cam-
paigned. that he would put gargoyles on the
Cathedral of Learning. “But there’s other
things to work on now.”

It's only harassment if you do it twice?

Paul Clark

 

;Don’t ask, don't tell:

*3 The Baby Boomers had it good. American produc- -

grew up in households with improving standards of

And they had drugs. Sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll.

.At least, that's the stereotype: Boomer kids living
;‘;h a cultural revolution who had wild and wonderful
"jsxperiences with marijuana while it was easy to come

2i’-

  
 
 
  
   
 
  

Y- '
.  So why does a new study from the Partnership for
. Drug-Free America show that the Boomers, who are
arents now, are so blind to the fact that their children
. moke grass? I
The numbers from the survey are staggering:
ile 44 percent of teenagers say they have tried the
lrug, only 21 percent of parents acknowledged the
possibility that their children might have experimented
yrith marijuana. Seven out of 10 teens say they have
riends who smoke marijuana, but only 45 percent of
iarents think their children have drug-using friends.
The disparity here is incredible, and the most like-
. y explanation is that parents just don't talk about drugs
with their kids much anymore.
One might think that in this day and age, when we
’reely discuss our president's sexual habits over meals

" ‘ pr coffee, communication on this subject might be a bit

lnore open. Oddly enough, it's not.

Even more surprising is that children want their
parents to talk with them about marijuana. The survey
shows that 66 percent of fourth graders wish they par-
, ents would talk more about drugs.

Perhaps the Boomers are embarrassed of their tales

bf youthful mischief. Maybe they feel uncomfortable

broaching the topic with their children. It's hard to

believe anybody would think there's no drug problem

in America.

Even if you're not so sure marijuana is as harmful

as some claim, you ought to agree that a child should

,be informed by his parents before listening to the kid

[sitting in the next seat on the school bus.

l Even if you believe, as many do,—that a reasonably

‘ ature adult should have some experience with mind-
ltering drugs, that for a properly educated person the
xperience can be an enlightening one, you probably
on't think 9-year-olds ought to be experimenting.

When this generation starts having children of its

wn, let's agree to take off the blinders and start paying
ttention to our kids.

Columnist

Federal Judge Susan Webber—
Wright has done all of us chauvin-
istic males a great service. Finally,
some government authority has
placed definitive legal limits on
sexual harassment. Judge Wright
clearly demonstrated in her ruling,
that certain behavior is accept-
able, even though a woman may
find such actions distasteful.

In dismissing the Paula Jones
case, Judge Wright stated that
even if Jones’ accusations were
true, although "boorish" and
"offensive," they still do not con-

" stitute sexual harassment. Jones

alleged that then-Gov. Bill
Clinton (her boss at the time)
called her into his room, sat down
next to her, moved his hand up her
thigh inside her skirt, pulled out
his "Jim Beam" and asked her for
oral sex. 1

From now on, this is not sex-
ual harassment. In fact, these
actions have such obvious perrnis—
sibiljty under the law, that it does-
n't even warrant a trial.

WAIT! Before Chancellor
Nordenberg, Coach Harris, Chief
Breznican, or any other head hon-
chos around here begin calling
their favorite Hot Lips underlings
into their office, you all must
remember one thing. You may
only ask once. Any repeated
requests constitute sexual harass-
ment. Ask twice and you're out of
a job and a few hundred thousand
dollars. The key to Judge Wright's
ruling is that, in Jones‘ situation,
there existed no threats or poten-
tial perks to her job security,
salary or beneﬁts and she was
only asked once. Wild Bill

Clincock took no for an answer,
left her alone, and that makes it
okay.

What does this say about
women's‘ rights? Feminist organi-
zations proclaim that women
should be protected from a hostile
work environment — i.e. being
the constant brunt of sexual jokes
or remarks over a long period of
time. Similarly, shouldn't women
be protected from their boss whip-
ping out his "Spicy Beefstick" and
asking them to take a bite?

Judge Wright's decision
allows for such one—time, per-
verse encounters. Her ruling
assumes that since the proposi-
tioned woman's paycheck is not
damaged, she is not damaged.
While, in reality, the woman ends
up feeling intimidated by her
boss, wondering whether he will
do it again, and looking over her
shoulder afraid of sexual assault.
Think about it: If someone is
crazy enough to expose his
"Executive Branch," stalking,
sexual assault, and rape may not
be too far off.

In reality, however, only the
really sexually insane would seize
upon this legal opportunity. The
question becomes: How prevalent
is this danger to women?

Having listened to much fem-
inist rhetoric over the years, one
may expect that without govern-
ment intervention, sexual harass-
ment would dominate the work-
place. Perverts like Clinton would
run rampant through their offices,
approaching women in "boorish"
and "offensive" ways. However,
liberals will be surprised at the
findings of an Investor's Business
Daily survey.

After questioning over 200

THE PITT NEWS

executives of top companies in
the United States, IBD_ found that
the following actions are consid-
ered sexual harassment and would
not be tolerated by the businesses:
- requests for sex tied to incen-
tives or penalties (99 percent of
those surveyed agreed this was
harassment) I
- indecent exposure (98 percent)
0 displays of sexual-ly oriented
photos or clippings (85 percent)
- sexually explicit language (74
percent)

The private "Big Businesses"
that most liberals loathe actually
protect women and women's right
to work in a safe environment
more than the government does. If
Jones‘ allegations were true and
‘Bill Clinton was the CEO of one
these companies, he would have
had a 98-percent chance of termi-
nation at the hands of the board of
directors. Business holds higher
standards than government.

Liberal feminist organizations
and anyone who supports equal
rights for women (including
myself) would be hypocritical.
Kathleen Willey, Monica
Lewinsky, former Ms. Arkansas
Elizabeth Grayson-Ward, and
Gennifer Flowers all demonstrate
Clinton's disrespect for his wife
and women's rights in general.
Willey and Lewinsky received

benefits and job promotions fol- O

lowing their encounters with the
president. I ask you, which work-
place is in need of reform: the

Oval Office or the rest of the

United States?

Paul Clark would never send his
sister, mother, or any other
woman who he cared about to
meet Bill Clinton.

Well yinz, this is it, the whole kit and *

City’s later, the latest chapter is closed.

My years here at the University A’
Pixsburg have been rill, rill memorable
—-— even more memorable than the
immortal one Terry Bradshaw’s first

Lotsa changes have taken place in
these four yirs. Some things have been
great, even better than a double kielbassi
and kraut samrnich. Other things have
been worse than Neil O’Donne1l on third

For instance, the Bucs have gone
from good to bad to good again (“We

'don’t miss ya Barry Bonds!”), the ‘Guins

have made a rill nice change from the Le
Magniﬁque’s era to L.W.M. (Life

are still searching for de’ elusive “One for

And the team that I live for, the for-

Immaculate Reception.

But -the Panthers’ road back to
national prominence has been littered
with more potholes than the Parkway
West and more starts and stops than the
Scroll Hill Tubes.

We’ve been through three football
coaches, two basketball coaches and two
af’letic directors in the last four yirs.
We’ve endured John Ryan’s four-inter-

Those past debacles make the future

least Mr. Walt Harris and Mr. Steve
Pederson ﬁnally look like the rill-dill. Of
course, they had to make plenty of
changes along the way.

They changed their attitude from
“We Believe (We Played Well Even
Though We Lost 72—0)” to just plain “We
Believe.” They changed their uniforms
from those ugly-as-the—C1eveland-
Browns-mustard—yellow to those rill
tough looking navy and gold. And they
actually made it fun to go to Pitt Stadium
again.

I’m looking forward to the next four

yirs of Pitt sports — a four yirs that hope-

fully will have more wins than you can

On Easter Monday, Steve Pederson
brought the women’s basketball team a pre-
sent.

Just a half-hour before she was intro-
duced to the media, new Lady Panther
hoops Head Coach Traci Waites met her
team for the ﬁrst time.

And Waites, an eight-year veteran of the
college coaching ranks, already had praise
for her players, who are currenﬂy deep into
off-season conditioning workouts.

“'Ihey’ve already made that commit-
ment without me,” Waites said, “I’m the last
piece of the puzzle.”

Waites announced two other pieces of
the puzzle as well — assistant coaches
Jennifer Britton and Bill Broderick, who will
be joining her. Broderick and Britton boast
17 years of combined coaching experience.

Broderick worked with Waites at
Arizona, where Waites spent the last four
years as an assistant coach. While at
Arizona, Waites helped take the team from
an 11-19 record in 1994-95 to a NCAA
Tournament berth this past season. Arizona

Arizona assistant replaces Bruce, meets team for first time

made it to the sweet 16 last year, and upset
national power Stanford during the regular
season, ending the Cardinal’s 48-game Pac-
1O Conference winning streak

In her last two seasons at Arizona,
Waites served as an associate head coach
under Joan Bonvicini. Her only prior head
coaching experience came at Santa Monica
Community College, which she captained in
the 1993-94 season after serving for three
seasons as an assistant The Corsairs reached
the state playoifs in each of her four seasons
with the team.

Pederson hopes that Waites can bring
similar successes to a struggling Lady

Panther hoops team; Waites is looking for- ,

ward to trying.

“I love challenges,” she said “We are
going to make a change in this program.”

Waites has already made one signiﬁcant
change to the program — she’s the ﬁrst
coach recruited from a different time zone.’

‘This was my ﬁrst time on the East
Coast, except for Georgia,” said Waites, who
played her college ball at Long Beach State.
She was born in Conyers, Ga., and noted she
was “anxious to be a part of the Pittsburgh

Tennis gets first-e er n ver Georgetown

Every year for over a decade, they
came up empty-handed. 9

But on Saturday, the women’s tennis
team ﬁnally broke its streak, beating the
Georgetown Hoyas for the ﬁrst time in
Pittsburgh women’s tennis history, 5-2.

“It was a real solid team effort,” said
Pitt Head Coach George Dieffenbach, who
has coached the Panthers in each of their
losses to the Hoyas, dating back to the 1982-
83 season. The match was Pitt’s last of the
season; The Panthers travel to Miami for the
year-ending Big East Tournament April 23-
26.

“This should help us in the Big East
seedings,” said the coach, who predicts that
the Panthers will be the ninth seed in the 13-
team event. Final pairings could be
announced as early as this weekend.

Singles winners for the Lady Panthers
against Georgetown this past weekend
included seniors Fran Davis and Amanda
Hoffman, junior Erin Shalbrack, and sopho-
more Alison Bucher.

Davis’ match ended in a 6-3, 6-1 win,
Hoffman was victorious in her match 6-2, 6-
1, and Shalbrack took a 6-4, 6-0 victory.
Bucher won by the narrowest margin of the
day, downing Hoya Lindsay Manwell by
the ﬁnal of 6-3, 6-4.

Freshmen Dana Jafarian and Lindsay

 
     

and by the team of Hoﬂinan and
Bucher, who won 8-2.

The only doubles loss for
Pittsburgh came from the duo of
Jafarian and Carlson, who lost an
8-3 match to Julie Horn and Jean
Roberts. Their teammates would
avenge the loss later — Shalbrack
defeated Hom in her singles’
match, and Davis downed
Roberts.

The singles and doubles
victories gave Davis a total of 121
career wins, adding to the school
record that she set last week at
Duquesne. The closest active play-
er to her record — Shalbrack, who
now has 81 victories — has been
Davis’ doubles partner for the
entire season.

Thanks in part to the suc-
cess of this pairing; Shalbrack is
 P only four wins away from where

Carlson — Pitt’s ﬁrst and second seeds —-
were the only Pittsburgh singles losses.
They were defeated 6-1, 6-4 and 64, 6-3,
respectively.

Doubles matches were won by Pitt’s
Davis and Shalbrack, 8-1 at the No. 1 seed,

Shalbraﬁc-Ii is still 40 wins shy  

“Every time she [Davis]
plays with her, she helps her
[Shalbrack] toward her goal,” said
Dielfenbach of the Davis-Shalbrack pair-
ing. Davis leads Pitt tennis in all-time dou-
bles victories with 68, and she is second in
total singles wins with 53. Julie LoPrinzi
holds the record with 66 singles victories.

Pitt's Tony Orlandini sprints toward the scouts at a recent Cost Center tryout.

Part II: After the season ends,
more work for three Pitt seniors

Brett Simon

Staff Writer

There is more to preparing for the
draft than the on—the-ﬁeld workouts and
drills. The players have to travel for pri-
vate workouts, interview with scouts,
and, when they are in the area, attend
classes.

Pete Gonzalez has been a busy man
during this off-season before the draft.
Gonzalez has attended both of the draft
workouts at the Cost Center and posted
some impressive numbers.

He achieved a 35-inch vertical leap,
and a personal best 4.64 seconds in the

“The scouts don’t want to show their
hand, but I know I won’t disappoint once
I get [to the NFL],” Gonzalez said.

Right now Gonzalez is working
hard with Panther Strength Coach
Buddy Morris to get ready for the draft.
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,
Gonzalez works out with Morris in the
weight room from 8 a.m. until noon.

“On off days I get together with Jake
Hoffart and work on footwork and
routes,” Gonzalez said. He said they
spend hours working on routes and tim-
ing passes to prepare for their workouts.

“You can’t please everyone and I’m
just trying to have a good time and do

40-yard dash,
while impressing
some scouts with
his throwing arm.

   

 

what they ask.
Hopefully I can
please someone and
keep them happy,”

A few weeks K in   V V.      Gonzalez said.
ago, Gonzalez  i   U n 1 i k e
ﬂew to Miami ' “ .. A A , " ‘ . Gonzalez’s modi-

with Michigan
quarterback Brian Griese for a workout
with eight different teams. Present at the
workout were ‘the Miami Dolphins,
Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers,
Cincinnati Bengals, Washington
Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, New
York Jets and Carolina Panthers.

“It went real well. I think I did better
than expected as a matter of fact. I think
it was a great opportunity for them to see
what I can do,” Gonzalez said.

During the workout in Miami, the
former Panther worked on throwing,
mobility, mechanics and arm strength.
Bruce Coslet, the head coach of the
Cincinnati Bengals, even stopped in to
check out the quarterback.

Still, Gonzalez wasn’t sure if any of
the teams were planning to draft him.

   

 ﬁed regimen, offen-
sive lineman Tony Orlandini has decided
not to change a good thing.

“I haven’t changed my workout
much. I just have to keep working hard
and wait for things to come,” Orlandini
said.

Orlandini lifts two hours a day, three
to four times a week to build up his
strength. In addition to weight training,
Orlandini runs for an hour and works on
his blocking technique during his work-
outs.

Orlandini is also using the Pitt
coaches for help preparing for the draft.

“The coaching staff ’s door is always
open. Buddy Morris is helping us out
with training,” Orlandini said

Orlandini said workouts with the

Panfher strength? coach are extremely
intense, but thatlijithey will help him pre-
are. 

“Something V 5’-}",;ve always believed in is
give 100-percent?’-iieffort. It’s always going
to pay. The people who give 100 percent
are the ones who;rsucceed,” Orlandini said.

The training seems to be paying off for

Orlandini. He bench pressed 225 pounds 9
an amazing 34 times in an early tryout

that number of presses is most likely
among the top marks in the country.

Orlandini credits some of his prepara-
tion to the Offensive Line Coach Tom
Freeman and Head Coach Walt Harris.

"‘Coach Harris brought in a lot of new
aspects into my game. The fact that he
brought in the West Coast Offense has
really helped me prepare for the NFL.”

The lineman is conﬁdent he will be
drafted on April: 19 -— the second day or
the draft, when rounds three through seven
take place.

“As far as I know they [scouts] are
impressed with my workouts. I’ve got to
continue to impress them. It’s in their
hands now,” Orlandini said.

Jake Hoffart has also had some
impressive workouts during his prepara-
tion for the draft. Hoffart was tops in the
Panther workouts in the shuttle run with an
impressive 4.13 timing. He also has per-
formed very well in the other quickness
drills.

FROM PAGE 8

“Everything I’ve donehas been excel-

’ lent except my 40-yard dash time. I just

have to go in and ‘make plays,” Hoffart
said. , I ’

On his own time,»»Hoffart works out
Mondays, Wednesdaysrand Fridays. “I’ve
been working real hard on the Stair Master
to improve my speed and windg”

» Hoffart has had private Workouts for
many teams including San ;Francisco,
Seattle,’ Cincirmati, Washingtoii, Carolina
and the Nevfﬁﬁgland Patriots.’ Not surpris-
ingly, the 49er workout made jhe biggest
impression on the California native.

“I was standing beside Dwight Clark‘

[former superstar wide receiver and now
executive for the San Francisg,%§9ers] and
I was in awe,” Hoffart said.

Despite the 49er experience, the senior
wideout would be more than happy to con-
tinue his career with the St6ClC£§.

“I’d love to stay here in ,,P,ittsburgh.
I’ve got my friends here  love the
city,” said Hoffart. ’ ‘

While these three players are all hop-
ing to get drafted, it’s possible that one,
none, or all three will actually be drafted.
No one will know until draft day what will

I happen.

But someone who’s in a good position
to guess —— Tom Donahoe, director of
Football Operations for the Pittsburgh
Steelers — was particularly impressed
with Gonzalez. "

“Pete had a great year,” said Donahoe.
“He has a lot of leadership and he’s

improved tremendously. He’s deﬁnitely
going to be in someone’s camp.” Donahoe
also said the only thing going against
Gonzalez is that he’s only 6-foot-1 — not ’
tall enough, perhaps, to see over the NFL’s
monstrous offensive linemen.

However, height is not the only thing.
to look at. “You really have to take a look
at other aspects. His height is only one fac-
tor. He broke records, and had a great year.
He has great leadership qualities,”
Donahoe said.

Todd Vasvaci, a Carolina Panther
scout agreed with Donahoe. Vasvaci said
he and another Carolina scout inMiami
have been very impressed with Gonzalez’s
workouts.

When Hoffart’s name was mentioned,
Donahoe did what most scouts do to
quickly gauge a wide receiver — he
looked over Hoffart’s average times in the
40-yard dash.

“Jake Hoffart has been a great receiv-
er for Pitt. He’s very dependable and he
plays much faster than he is,” Donahoe
said. Donahoe said that he thought Hoffart

_ had a shot a being drafted, but couldn’t say
for sure. .

Overall, Vasvaci was excited about the
Panthers’ workout

“I think Orlandini and Gonzalez have
a real good shot to be drafted. Real good,”
Vasvaci said. ’

Donahoe added that Orlandini “plays
a position that’s in demand. That will also
help his chances.”

look back. While it’s difﬁcult to
sum up my four yirs at Pitt in just
one word, I’ll do my best.

I thought of so many different
ways to paraphrase my experi-
ence, but in the end, it came down
to sports. _

The word that I thought of to
sum up my ‘past four ear is,
admittedly, stolen from e most-
famous, most—beloved, most-
revered, Pitt News sports editor of
all time, Myron Cope.

“Yoi!”

But before I get out like Neil
O’Donnell,“*I want to send some
rill important shout-outs to all the
yinzers, and even the non—yinzers,
who have made these yirs so good.
