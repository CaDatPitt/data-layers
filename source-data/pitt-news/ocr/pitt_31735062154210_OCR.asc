said, a team which is at all times cap-

There is anabundancc of, material

due Coach Mays lidmundson, who has
worked so uritiringly to turn out a

Baseball has had a rapid rise in the

three years ago the, team was a. sthlgr

up with its schedule, and to-day lt»lS
one of the leading college _,teams of
