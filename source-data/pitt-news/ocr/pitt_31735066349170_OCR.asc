Vol. 70, No. 32

Monday, November l7, l 975

BY RICK STOUFFER

The Pitt football team has

accepted a bid to appear in the 41st

annual Sun Bowl game December

26 in El Paso, _Texas. The bid

- followed the Panthers’ stunning

upset Saturday of the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish, 34-20.

[See story, page,l0]

The announcement was made
jointly by Head Football Coach
Johnny Majors and Sam Jenkins,

 assistant chairman of the SunBowl

Committee.

“We have invited,Pitt to appear
in our Sun Bowl this year, and they
have accepted,”
“We are tickled pink.”

“We look for a, high-powered,

offense when we search for a bowl
team, and Pitt certainly showed us
that today.”

The game will be the second part
of a doubleheader televised nation-
wide on CBS beginning at noon
(Eastern Time).

“I am indeed honored and
delighted to accept a bid to_ play in
the Sun Bowl,” Majors said. “We

_;,---‘,.took a straw vote following the

1,23,.

' game and the players unanimously

agreed to a bowl.

“I had the pleasure of coaching
there in 1971 with the Iowa State
team and I can safely say it is a

tremendous place to play football. ” .

“We were very wary to make the
selection this- year and because of

the NCAA rule that states you can’t

Did a One-Mani Crusade
Strangle ‘Deep Th root’?

BY BILL MOORE V

Odds are against Pitt students
seeing Deep Throat this year, but
Amateur Radio Association (ARA)
President Sanford Silverberg
doesn’t seem to "realize ‘it, and
that’s about the only thing he has
going for him.

Silverberg has been trying to

convince the.Student Government"

Board (SGB) to grant his organiza-
tion a $600 budget modiﬁcation to

cover the cost of bringing the»

controversial ﬁlm here.

That request was turned down,
and now Silverberg is banking on
undergraduate student Ron Voll-
mer, who has pledged to come up
with the cash needed to rent the
ﬁlm and cover related expenses.

But Silverberg’s chance just
about died with the Student
Government decision Wednesday
not to allow the budget modiﬁca-
tion, according to Student Activi-

‘ties Director Dan Meloro.

Meloro said Friday it is unlikely
Silverberg will be able to show the
film. First of all, Meloro said, the
Franklin Pangbom Film Club and
the Student Union Board already
show entertainment 'ﬁlms, and it
has been University policy to
restrict ﬁlm programming chieﬂy
to those_two groups.

Second, Meloro said, for any
type of program to be held within
the‘ University, using University

, buildings and ‘equipment, the
ﬁnancial arrangements have to be
chaneled through the University
Accounting Ofﬁce. Silverberg’s

i plan to use the private’ funds

instead of Student Activities funds
probably would be unacceptable,
Meloro said.

'And, Meloro pointed out, there
is also ‘ the possibility City
authorities could take action
against any showing of the ﬁlm.

The ﬁnal blow to Silverberg’s
plans is the discovery that the ARA
nolonger needs the money from
the film to pay for_ equipment it
planned to buy, but can afford the
equipment with funds it presently
has.

Silverberg is undaunted, how-
ever. “I’m going ahead now on
principle,” he said yesterday.

He said he hadn’t approached
the administration since the SGB
decision, but wanted to construct a
“good, solid argument” ﬁrst.

Silverberg has spoken with a A

lawyer, and if the student body
were behind him, he promised, he
would go to court.

But Silverberg need only ask
SGB president Larry Platt to ﬁnd
out how hard it is generating any
sort of student support. Granted,
there are quite a few who would see
the ﬁlm if it came, but they
wouldn’t necessarily storm the
Chancellor’s office if it didn’t.

A student group legitimately
needing funds might have been
able to overcome the problems, but
Silverberg’s one-man crusade on
matters of principle probably can’t.

Unless Silverberg finds strong
support—-and that is doubtful——or
the administration changes its‘

stand—and that is even more-

doubtful—it looks like Pitt Voyeurs
will have to look elsewhere for
vicarious entertainment.

Davis Calls for Unity

To ‘Tear Down the Wall’   .

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

“We’re going to have to ﬁght
like hell to tear down the wall of
racism,” Angela Davis said,
keynoting the third annual confer-

‘ence against racism and political

repression Friday at Soldier’ and
Sailors’ Memorial Hall. She told
the crowd unity is the only solution.

“If we can unite one day we will
not only be able to ﬁght City Hall,
one day we will take it over, ”Davis
said.

Davis charged that racism is
being fostered by the
administration in league with
several of the country’s largest
corporations, in order to keep the
working class from uniting. Their
ultimate goal, according to Davis,
is the preservation of an elitist
business monopoly and the de-
struction of the power of the
working class.

“As long as white workers’

believe that black workers are the

‘ ones whothreaten their jobs, and
_ _ not the racist repressive system,

then the capitalists will not only

"succeed in oppressing black work- '

ers, but white workers also.”
While there have been some
victories against racism, Davis

Pro-AC0” roiﬁct vs. VD, Birth A

BY MARILYN ZRUST

.Two departments in the Grad-
uate School of Public Health
(GSPH) are conducting a study to
ﬁnd a contraceptive preparation
that will serve as a veneral disease
prophylactic.

The Population Division and the
department of epidemiology and
microbiology of GSPH, under
contract with the Office of
Population of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, have

‘ designeda study known as the’

Pro-Con (Prophylaxis-Contracep-
tion) Project.

“In prevention of the sexually
transmitted diseases, particularly
VD, there are three types of
prophylaxes, the ﬁrst two of which

‘ depend primarily upon the patient,

while the third requires medical
intervention,” said Dr. John C.
..Cutler, associate chairman and
director of the Population Program
of the Department of Health
-Services Administration.

I Cutler said the condom, origin-_

Ford ’

said, it is still the ideology guiding ’

the country’s police departments.
She reported that in the last three
years, 30,000 people have been
killed and another 30,000 have
been wounded by police action.

Davis‘ said the government is
carrying out a campaign against
those ﬁghting racism, and cited the
San Quentin Six, who protested the
murder of George Jackson, as an
example of political‘ frameups.
Davis further warned that the
murders of Dr. Martin Luther King
and Malcolm X were no mere
coincidences. '

“Most important, if it were not
for racism, we in this country would
not be so tragically divided against
each other, while Mr. Ford laughs
his way to Mr. Mellon’s bank.”

Davis contended Watergate was
not an isolated incident and that its-
spirit still lingers over-the country.
She_ described Ford as a “clean”
Nixon, dubbing him Gerald “Sec-
ond-Hand” Ford.

The irony of the U.S. political
system, Davis said, was character-

ized by Dick Gregory when he said .

it was the only country where “A

‘ man like Gerald Ford can become. a - 4:

president . ’ ’

The very decision-making pro-
cess of a corporation is dictatorial,
Davis pointed out. A board of
directors makes a decision, which
is passed on to managers who in
turn pass it on to the workers. This
IS the same sort of thinking that
permeated Watergate, she said.

“The corporation’s attempt" to
turn the government into a political

dictatorship, that is the underlying 7
meaning of Watergate,” Davis’

"said.

Davis asserted that Pittsburgh is
a traditional site for the struggle
between labor and the industrial

complex. The Camegies, Scaifesv

and Mellons, she claimed, have  ll

tried to make Pittsburgh a city of
the ruling class, and not of the
struggles of the workingclass.

Sarcastically punctuating Cher

sentences, Davis questioned Whe-0 .,

there the names of Carnegie and
Mellon could be synonomous with
the ideals of a university education.
And, she went on, “one gets the
distinct iimpressiong that this isn’t

ally perceived as a mechanical
barrier of transmission of VD, in
most of the world now regarded
more as a contraceptive.

The Pro-Con Project was de-
signed to ﬁnd a preparation that

will be easily used prior to sexual .

tricted medication so that it would‘

be available for over-the-counter »

Strike Likely}, PFTSays  

A strike by Pittsburgh teachers
on December 1 is inevitable and
may last a month or more,
Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers
(PFT) president Albert Fondy said
at a press conference Friday.

In a news session called
especially for a news writing class
at Pitt. Fondy said the PFT is

preparing for a lengthy strike in the ‘

likely event a satisfactory contract
proposal on this year's contract is
not offered to the teachers by the
November 30 deadline.. _
“Right now we're nowhere near
resolving the differences we have
with the school board on pay,

working conditions and class size,”-

Fondy said. “I can't even say right
now what a reasonable offer to us
would be at this time."

Fondy also said the proposed

school budget cuts of $8 million to

$9 million made by Pittsburgh

_judges and school board members

would serve only to hamper the
educational system.

“You can't take nine million
dollars out of the budget without
dccimating the educational sys-
tem," Fondy said. “Inflation, new
programs and increases in the
experience level of teachers have
combined to increase costs."

Fondy said the PFT considers
itself a constructive force in the
Pittsburgh school system and
blamed the impending strike for
the most part on _an adament
school board.

“The school board can’t criticize
the validity of the PFT proposal, so
what it says is that the demands are
unncgotiable and there's no money
to pay for the demands, anyway,"
Fondy said.

 Granting partial recognition to the Pitt chapter of the national
‘Student Coalition Against Racism (SCAR) was a wise compromise
measure for the Student Government Board (SGB) to take.

.  SCAR members requesting full recognition before proving
themselves under a probationary period of partial membership, and
with the_Committee on Student Organizations (CSO) recommending no
recognition at all, the SGB had no reasonable alternative to taking the
middle road.

I l The reasons given ‘by the CS0 for its recommendation are feeble.
’, First, it claims SCAR’s overwhelming thrust is directed toward the
outside community. How much more “outside” can SCAR’s activities
be than those of other student political groups? '

1, _ Second, they see a danger in recognizing a group “whose sole
E ‘purpose and goal is one single-issue area. ” The rationale for this point
‘ 1. is ridiculous and raises serious questions about the competence of the

T CSO.
 ftmction with one single-issue area? Does the Ski Club? And even if

. they don’t, what would be wrong with functioning with one objective?
f  Finally, the CS0 claims SCAR would duplicate the function of the

What is “one single-issue area?” Does the Unicycle Club

"§ Republicans, the Student Government and the Young Socialist
" Alliance. To that we can only say the ﬁght against racism is but a
.t sideline for each of these groups, and some naturally give the issue less
attention than others. _
 Under the CSO’s reasoning, the Undergraduate Women’s Union ‘
 ‘should not be an ofﬁcially recognized group since women’s rights is
. just as much an objective of the above groups as is the decline of

Taking SCAR’s argument into consideration, however,’ we "feel it

The Zionism-as-R aeism Vote

BY W..JACK ROMBERG

There comes a time when we
must detach ourselves from the
throes of our mundane lives and
take stock of the world around us.
During this time, there are certain

= events that deserve more than a

precursory notice. They must be
evaluated within the context of the
human condition. Then, and only
then, can these events be judged.

The passage of the U.N.

resolution equating Zionism. with

racism is such an event. This event
is important for two reasons. First,
it is the only measure of functional
anti-Semitism ever to gain the
sanction of a world body. But more
disillusioning is that the third world
countries ﬁnally have descended to
the depths of the colonial powers
that used to rule them.

Some will argue that anti-Zion-

ism is not anti-Semitism, because

the former does not deny anyone
the right to be a Jew. Therefore,

the U.N. resolution is not anti-

exploit more people per square .

mile, stimulating the economy as
well as the religious’ sector.
However. new and faster means
of exploitation, mass media cam-
paigns and the development of a
federal government may well have
rendered the city obsolete.

Semitic. What the U.N. resolution
is really saying, however, is that all
national liberation movements are
legitimate except for the Jewish

‘ one. The argument that Judaism is

just a religion is invalid because
throughout history, Jews ‘have
been treated as a race, as a people,
as 'a misplaced nationality, but
never as “just” a religion.
Further, the idea of a- Jewish
homeland, or “n_ext year
Jerusalem,” is so central to the

Jewish religion that to. deny a Jew‘

the right to believe it is to deny him
his right to be a Jew. In essence,
the U.N. resolution is trying to gain
justice for Palestinians at the
expense of justice for the Jews.
The ideas of a Jewish and a
Palestinian homeland need not be
contradictory. The U.N. resolution
of 1948 partitioned Palestine into

The city, a nexus of interaction,

of this can be conducted in a matter

In fact, some noted sociologists,
aware that mass-marketing and
consumerism are the core of the
cash ﬂow that makes this counry
great, have gone _so far as to
suggest it is time to scrap the city.

No Jew with any common sense
and compassion would deny that
the Palestinians have been op-
pressed, but it has been an
oppression as much by Arabs as by
Jews. The only solution that even
approaches justice would be the
creation of a West Bank State

While Israel so far has refused to
consider this possibility in negotia-

While there have been govern-
mental changes in some of these

premier racists.

But the U.N. resolution repre-
sents a lot more than the latest
round of anti-Semitism. It is an
example of a type of vote-buying as
dirty and underhanded as the
United States’ use of foreign aid as
a blackmail weapon. Western
diplomats who lobbied against the
resolution said the response of
many of the third-world countries
they approached was, “What can
you offer us?" i"

What happened was relatively

especially Libya, offered aid to

corrupted decision-making in ‘
whichlogic and morality have no
bearing. Instead_ of leading the
way to new world order, the third
world has succeeded only in
furthering the polarization that
already has devastated human
relations.

If nothing else, this resolution
has shown the western world the
consequences of its policy; it no
longer can try to bully the third

world with threats of withholding , 

aid. But this revelation does little
to lessen the impact of a resolution
that is patently anti-Semitic.
Perhaps the only respite is the
knowledge that this resolution, like
so much of the U.N.’s work, is only
another piece of paper.

A SInoki11gBan?

I am a student in the External
Studies Program—a middle-aged,
employed professional woman with
ﬁve children. The return to the
classroom was at ﬁrst frightening.
then amusing to have to ask my
own college-age children to clarify
issues and concepts. It has become

exciting to have my mind stimula- .

ted with new information and new
understandings.

But I ﬁnd one aspect of campus
life annoying. This is the common
practice of smoking in class and

public meetings. It irritates my,

throat (I -am a singer) and it
irritates my eyes. They burn. itch
and water, which makes reading
and note-taking difﬁcult. There are
times when the odor of tobacco, or
whatever, is so sickening-sweet I
feel asif I'm going to vomit.
Everyone may not be as sensitive
as I am, but the fact remains that
smoking is hazardous to the
health ofsmokcrs and non-smokers
‘alike. I am subjected to smoke
against my will. Let me cite another
example. _
Wednesday evening, my hus-

band and I -attended a public-

lecture at the Student Union, the
keynote address to the Bicentennial
series "The American Religious
Experience." This was followed by
a panel response. during which
time a young female teacher at Pitt,
a member of the panel. passed out.
It may have been unrelated, but
she was surrounded by a "cloud"
of witnesses. including ﬁvc panel-
ists who were smoking. some
chain-style. Such an onslaught of
pollution in a warm, closed room
was at best unkind. And these are

value system one of concern for
others’ freedoms, or is it one of
freedom to do as one pleases?" It's
‘ironic that the actions of this
auspicious group negated thei_r
rhetoric. Likewise, ‘students, in the
audience, some of whom professed
superior. motives to their elders
caught up in “pop culture-‘civil

Maybe I over-idealized the
college community, but I really
thought that the present campus
trend included a concern for
environment and clean air; espe-
cially at a major university like Pitt
with its famous School of Public
Health. whose "staff and students
had» some impact upon
Pittsburgh’s pollution problems. Is
it that only corporations sin, but not
people?

Penn State University has

This is the first of a three-part
series examining the feasibility of
holding the 1984 World’s Fair in
Pittsburgh. 5 V

BY CAL RITCHEY

Will Pittsburgh sponsor a
world’s fair in 1984? It could
happen, if some of the City's
leaders have their way.

It’s probably a good idea—if it’s
planned with care. Since 1984 isn’t
far off, it’s time to be thinking
seriously’ about that planning.
Fairs take lots of _money to
construct and operate, and it takes
time to raise money.

The idea of a world’s fair in
Pittsburgh isn’t unreasonable. The
City is ready for the outside world.
After decades of living shrouded in
clouds of dark smoke, Pittsburgh is
emerging from the neolithic ‘smog
to become a modern city. s

For years television writers have
found peculiar delight in making
Pittsburgh the butt of jokes.
Perhaps it’s time to show the world
that we too are capable of
entertaining the nations.

Of course, Pittsburgh will be

putting itself on trial by attempting

  

to sponsor a world’s fair.

critics—including a lot of Pitts-

It’ll take a lot of planning and a lot
of patience before we prove we can
do it.

There are many problems built
into a world’s fair. It isn’t just a
case of throwing up a few big
buildings and paving over a vacant
lot or two for additional parking.
Fairs have encountered more than
their share of difficulties since the
first “world’s” fair back .in 1851.

It was held in London in the
Crystal Palace, a specially con-
structed building measuring 1,851
(the date of the fair) feet by 456 feet
by 66 feet. The Crystal Palace» had
800,000 square feet of ﬂoor space,
across which some six million
visitors strolled to see the displays.
The Crystal. Palace closed its door
with a neat surplus of $750,000.

Since then, fairs have. had their
ups and downs. Costs are
astronomical for modern fairs; of
the three major fairs in the last 10
years, two lost money. The, New
York Fair of 1964-65 cost $150
million and lost about $21 million.
Expo 67, in Montreal, lost about
$200 million, despite attendance by
50,306,648 people. The Osaka,

BY STEVE FINE

Theft is the most prevalent crime
on campus, comprising nearly 50%
ofall crimes reported. The Campus
Police estimate more than 1000
thefts will take place on campus in
I975. The loss in property ‘to
students, faculty and the Univer-
sity will total approximately
$100,000. __ _

Dennis is a thief. He steals
stereos, televisions, expensive
appliances. jewelry, Clothing...
"anything worth a few quick
bucks." Some of it he trades for
drugs ("I just steal it back later"),
but most of his haul is sold and
traded among his circle of thieves.

“I've been thievin' for over 10
years," he said. “Only the turkeys
get caught. If you got any class at
all, it's easy to get over.

“It’s easy to tell if a person’s
home or not. I walk into a building,
‘check the mailbox, look for a
newspaper lying in front of the
door. I usually don't rob a person
unless I know them, so I usually
know their hours, too. People set
stereo speakers in the windows...
it's easy to tell what people got.”

Gaining entry to a room or an

‘apartment is relatively easy for

Dennis. He carries only two tools, a
screwdriver or knife, and a rigid
card, like a credit card or an ID.

A deadbolt lock on the door is

about the only defense against a‘

thief like Dennis. This lock is
jimmy-proof, is easy to install, and
costs less than $10. It is available at
most hardware stores.

Other steps can be taken to‘

prevent theft. Thieves learn a lot
about where to look just by
listening. ' '
“Somebody gets a new stereo or
a TV and they want to tell the world

“I guess the best way to stop me _

A the ' economy,

( Continued from Page 5)
Japan, Expo 70 was more
fortunate; it claims to have ended
with a surplus of about $56 million.

The key to a world's fair does not
lie’ in the gate receipts (except

' tangentially). It's what is spent in

outside money that is important to
both local and
national. _ '

In Osaka, the fair had a
signiﬁcant effect, according to the

 Osaka Ofﬁcial Report, a three-

volume compilation running more
than 1,500 pages. The construction
and operation budget for the
Exposition was more than $307
million. The money was obtained
from the Japanese Government

A’  a ($37,500,000), the,State and Osaka

City ($39,725,000) and the" Kinki

 A District (county) ($4,375,000).

All this money eventually was

0 ffunneled through the Japanese

economy. The Official Report
estimates that gross demand as a

N result of the Expo was a whopping

Yen 700,000 million—$2.45 billion.

With the Multiplier Effect (an
economic principal that suggests
each dollar spent provides income
for someone else down the line),

 the total demand created by the

Fair was on the order of $5.25
billion. ‘

Even without the Multiplier
Effect,.the gross demand created
by Expo 70 was estimated to be
about .3% of the Gross National
Product for all of Japan from
1967-1970.

Putting aside the plethora of
ﬁgures, it’s obvious that Expo 70
brought in great amounts of money
to the Osaka region. That’s
inevitable when 50 million people
visit a speciﬁc site.

There were other beneﬁts for
Osaka, however.

itself closed, the site was restruct-
ered; some of the buildings were
torn down, and a permanent park,
which includes the Japanese
Garden structure, the Japan Folk
Crafts Museum and the Expo
Museum of Fine Arts, was left.

In Montreal, the site of Expo 67
was also reopened as a park after
the fair closed. Although it
operated at a loss of more than $11
million in the 1970 season, half of
the loss was absorbed by the
Quebec Government. In addition,
the park is said to have generated
$260 million in tourist revenues.
The San Antonio HemisFair of 1968
lost $6 million, but when the dust
settled the city had a $10 million
convention center and a permanent
entertainment park. V

In Osaka, hotel space increased
by 58% as a -result of the fair,
while Osaka’s Rapid Transit Lines
expanded by 27.5 kilometers-
about 44 miles——in 1968 and 1969.
In the eight years preceding 1968,
there was only a 20-kilometer
increase. The mileage of paved
roads increased also.

There's little doubt that a fair in
Pittsburgh would beneﬁt the City,
the State and the nation.
Interestingly enough, there are
reported to be no fairs scheduled
for the U.S. for the remainder of
this century, though that could
change—and probably will. '

Pittsburgh could do a lot with a
ﬁve billion-dollar input as the

result of a fair. And if the fair is’

well-planned, Pittsburgh could
enjoy the fruits of 1984 for many
years. ‘

Transcendental Meditation

Religion, Science, Scheme?

BY BARB MUROCK
Transcendental Meditation
(TM), the technique of daily

meditation to achieve a deep state
of‘ rest, recently has been the
subject of wide publicity. Televi-
sion talk shows, a best-selling
novel, and newspaper and maga-
zine articles are exploring this new
phenomenon. A wide cross-section
of Americans, from celebrities to
athletes, from clergy to politicians,
have claimed beneﬁcial results
from practicing two 20-minute
periods of meditation each day.

Just what is TM? The newest
popular craze orreligious cult to
capture temporarily the fancy of
the American public? The money-
making scheme of a mystical,
bearded Hindu monk? Or does it
have long-lasting beneﬁts for its
followers?

The technique of TM is simple,

'according'to Mike Horner of the

Student International Meditation
Society. In an introductory lecture
last week in David Lawrence Hall,
Horner explained: ‘‘It involves two
20-minute periods of meditation.
The meditator sits in a comfortable
upright position with his eyes
closed."_Horner stressed that the
mind is allowed to flow freely
without_ attempting to control
thoughts.
. ‘.‘TM is a very deep state of rest,
deeper than sleep," Homer said.
“It releases stress, tiredness and
fatigue." The meditator learns how
to relax better, and therefore
perform better at whatever he
does. _

“TM brings out the more within.
It taps your own creative intelli-
gence.” V

But a meditator is not in a trance

v or asleep during meditation.

Horner calls the condition “restful
alertness," in which one “closes
his mind and quiets his body, but is
awake inside."

The niationwidei interest in TM‘

ls Transcendental Meditation just a money-making scheme of a
I mystical, bearded Hindu? Or does it offer long-lasting benefits?

has spurred scientists to explore
the phenomenon, and many have

undertaken experimentation.

“Something is deﬁnitely going on
in meditation," Horner said.
“There are significant physiologi-
cal changes.

“The body shows a 16% drop in
oxygen content, where there is a
.8-10% drop experienced in sleep.”
Cardiac output, he said, drops by
as much as 30%. In addition, TM
brings on Galvonic Skin Response,
brainwave and biochemical chan-
ges. ,_
“Interestingly, scientists have
found greater synchroneity be-
tween the two spheres of the brain
during TM,” Homer said. He said
scientists long have believed that
one half of the brain controls logic
and onehalf controls emotion. He

believes inconsistencies in person-

Walter photo

.ality.are caused possibly by a
conflict between logic and emotion.

“If this is true, then what we
may be seeing is the individual
becoming more in tune
himself." This synchroneity may
account for claims by meditators
that they are better equipped to
deal with problems in their lives.

Much of the seeming mystery
surrounding_ TM stems from
the meditators’ use of a secret
mantra. A mantra is a meaningless
sound repeated during meditation.

“Sound is really powerful,"
Homer stressed. “It affects
different individuals different .

ways.’-’ He claimed the pitch of a
mantra resonates with an indivi-
dual's mind and life support
systems. That is why different
people require different mantras.

Piano Students Debut,
Unique Mix of Styles

BY PAMELA EUSI

Thursday night at the Frick Fine

Arts Auditorium, eight piano
students from Pitt’s music depart-
ment presented a program that was

’both interesting and effective. It

consisted of the entire 24‘Preludes
Opus 28 by Chopin.

For any one person to tackle all
24 Preludes is a major task. The
students alternated and provided a
variety of unique playing styles.

Chopin began the Preludes late
in 1835. He worked on a number of
them in 1838 while he wintered
with French authoress George
Sand in Majorca, Spain. Finally,
all 24 were completed in January,
1839. _ _.

Chopin's major influence for. the
Preludes was Bach. Chopin was
interested in counterpoint and
thought the fugue was the logic of
all music. , Before giving a concert
he would immerse himself com-
pletely in Bach for a couple of
weeks. -

Robert Schumann once said,
“The Preludes are. strange
pieces...they are sketches, the
beginnings of studies.” He is
correct; They reflect-the varying
moods of Chopin from 1835 to 1839.

Of the eight students, Larry
Meeck and Paula Rodney stood out
from the others. Meeck’s

interpretation of No. 21 ‘facinated V

the audience and his No. .5
contained some of the most difficult
technique of the evening.
Rodney’s forte seemed to be
tricky patterns and complicated
rhythms. As far as she was

piece that would have beenterriblyr-at
monotonous except "for her quiet? -If

grace at the keyboard. Her
rendition of Nogll wove fantastic
harmonies andfdynamics within a
lovely melody. The result left
everyone wishing for more of this
“cheerful Chopin."

Schulz got off to a slow start, but
his playing of No. 15,, with its
recurring “raindrop," gave a
melancholy note to the last part of
the concert. He really triumphed in
No. 22, in which Chopin's sense of
tragedy struck in-a blatant way.
Fiery chords formed a superb
contrast to the otherwise subdued
moods.

Two other short pieces must be

Chopin works everyone knows but
that no one can name.

Believe it or not, classical music

does find its way into popular’

music occasionally.‘ No. 20 has a
chord pattern that is repeated ﬁve
or six times. This chord pattern
forms the backbone of Barry
Manilow’s single “Could It Be
Magic.’-’

The effort by these students was
not the most professional by any
means. but the feeling put into the
concert as a whole and into the
individual pieces more than made
up for the awkward. moments and
mistakes.

Production ‘Settles for Half’

A (Continued from Page 8)

The home should be a
metaphor for Eddie’s
power.

But her utilization of the physical
design is excellent. She sustains
the triangular nature of the
relationships and reveals them in
her design. ~

David Rinear’s direction has
improved greatly over that in his
past productions of Scapin and
Pantegleize. The pace and rhythm
mounted until the ﬁnal blow. But
the endingseemed rushed. Many

eroding

events occur within a short time
span. So Rinear must simultan-
eously allow enough time for the
audience to catch on as he
completes Eddie’s tragedy.

Under Rinear’s skill, a multitude
of characters lived and died.

Donald Eisen’s sensitivity to
Eddie’s tragic ﬂaw is a subtle
mixture of explosion and control.
He unleashes his pent-up emotion
in a ﬁnal act bursting with “Purity
in Passion.” Yes, he is a driven
man———but in the ﬁnal scene he is

driving straight__to hell in__ the

driver’s seat. \

Victoria Paal gave her acting
debut as Catherine, the child/
woman in Eddie’s life. She and
Jocelyn Johnson comprise the neat
world that has learned how to
bend. ,

Paul Binotto, as Catherine’s
ﬁance Rudolpho, displays his
diversity as an actor once again.

A View From the Bridge had.the
potential to be a great piece of
theater. Pitt’s theater, unlike
Eddie Carbone, has _‘‘settled for
half.”

BY RICK STOUFFER
’ Sports Editor’

It’s been due for a long time, 12
years in fact, ‘ but it ﬁnally
happened. Last Saturday the Pitt
Panthers put together probably the
best day they have had in more
than a decade to defeat Notre
Dame, 34-20.

Not Army or William and Mary,
but NOTRE DAME, the Fighting
Irish, one of the most respected
teams in the entire country and
known for the rugged defense it

‘displays at the drop of a shamrock.

“We did it and I can't think of’

A the words to describe it,” Johnny

Majors said. “I’ve never seen a
group of assistant coaches work as

.hard as ours did this week in

preparation for this game.

“But it came down to the kids
goingout on the ﬁeld and doing the
job and they did ‘it. V I’m not
popping off but we did it.”.

When talking about players, how
can you _ not talk about _Tony
Dorsett? Thecomment throughout
the game in the press box was that

, if you live to be 100, you might

on Saturday. On just" 23
carries—303 yards rushing plus an
additional 71 through the air.

“If ‘I hadn't seen it I wouldn’t
have believed it,” said Irish Coach
Dan Devine. ’

But Dorsett wasn’t the only
bright spot of the day. The Panther

« defense came to life and shut down

the Irish attack at every turn, save
for one _ sustained drive in the
fourth quarter.

“The defense was just fantas-V

tic,” Majors said. “They didn’t
get frustrated, kept their poise
throughout and did a heck of a
job.” . I -

balance all day. Three plunges int.“
the line netted three yards. 

With a fourth and one, Devine
gambled, and it payed off when
quarterback Rick Slager snuck over
for the touchdown. The extra point
made it 10-7._ I

But they yet had seen the last of
Dorsett.

Touching the ball twice, the
“Hawk” picked up eight yards on a
fumble out of bounds and then
amazed the _spectators with a
71-yard touchdown run on a sweep
to the outside. The PAT again put
the Panthers ahead with a lead they
never gave up. .

“You know things are going be‘,

\

when a kid can fumble the ball and ’

eight of our guys kick it out of
bounds,” Devine said.

The Irish got as close as one
point in the opening seconds of the
second period when Reeve hit on a
47-yard ﬁeld goal. But six minutes
later, Long reciprocated with a
42-yarder of his own and_ Pitt led
17-13.

Six plays later, Randy Cozens,.
who played an outstanding game
on defense, caused a Notre Dame
fumble that was recovered by Al
Romano on the Pitt 34.

Three plays later, Cavanaugh hit
an obscure ﬁgure in the middle of
the ﬁeld (at least Notre Dame must

have thought so) when Dorsagf:

caught a pass and went down the-
middle of the ﬁeld, as if he were
the only one playing ball, for a
49-yard score with less than four
minutes left in the half.

Halftime statistics were ridicu-
lously in Pitt’s favor. Total offense

Offensively Matt Cavanaugh
showed the concentration and
savvy not many sophomores have
when facing the caliber of a Notre
Dame.

“We had planned all day to come
out and throw more on ﬁrst and
second down to open up their
defense,” Cavanaugh said.

“I think we’ve been building for
a big game for a long time,”
Majors said. “All week long I felt
we were going to have a good
game. But I was cautious about the"
feeling. I didn’t_ want to '53,,

“We needed a win like this, and

1 it will deﬁnitely help our program.

It shows wecan win the big games
when necessary. Our people have
consistency and conﬁdence, things
you have to have to be a winner.”

The win does indeed show the
world and especially the Nittany
Lions of Penn State that the little
showdown next week in Three
Rivers Stadium might be a bit more
even than at ﬁrst imagined.

At least one staunch State fan
will think so; Joe Paterno sat mute
for most ofthe contest, occasionally
pointing out plays or players to his
scouts, and even cheered for
Dorsett a few times. But the fact

remains, the Panthers have grown‘-V-_
up. If Notre Dame can be taken, “ ‘

and taken with the skill and power
displayed last Saturday, the Lions
just as easily can be taken.

The answer is as simple as

No one scored for the rest of the
quarter, but it then became a game
of how many yards Dorsett could
make. On his 23rd carry of the day,
T.D. went over the magic 300-yard
