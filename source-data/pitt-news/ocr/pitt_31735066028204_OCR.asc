University of Pittsburgh

Interim Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said Margaret McDonald will move into
the position on an interim basis.
McDonald is currently the assistant vice
chancellor for academic affairs in the
health sciences and has been with Pitt
since I984.

Weber’s main role at Pitt was oversee-
ing fundraising and alumni relations.
His two—and—a-half years at Pitt were
spent while the school battled public
image concerns, which might have
affected stagnant fundraising cam-
paigns.

One of those is the undergraduate
business school, which to date has
raised $1 million of the $25 million it
needs. Pitt’s Master Space Plan, which

The door for Pitt administrators has
been wide open since the departure of
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor, and
another university official has just
walked through it.

Lawrence Weber announced his resig-
nation Friday, effective immediately.
Weber held the post of vice chancellor ‘
of institutional advancement since May
1992. .

Weber said his decision to leave Pitt
was based on the belief that when the
university selects a new chancellor, it
will need a new team, according to Pitt
spokesperson Ken Service.

WASHINGTON —— Black
men from across the country
will join together today for the
Million Man March on
Washington to make statements
for racial pride, political respect
and to pledge atonement for
social sins past, like parental
absenteeism and spousal abuse.

Their intent is to show the
world that there are more than
just a few good black men.

The march takes place at a
crucial time when the issue of
racial equality is in the fore-
front in the wake of the O.J.
Simpson trial verdict and the
move (to re-exarnine affirmative

Many have complained that
the true idea of the march has
been put on the back burner,

Israeli room captures dramatic history

By Melissa Pearlman
For The Pitt News

If you have classes in the Cathedral of
Learning, you are bound to have at leastone
class in one of the many nationality rooms.

If you enter a room where your desk chairs are
intricate pieces of stonework, or the walls con-
tain historical bookcases and scrolls, or the door
of the classroom contains the Ten
Commandments written in another language,
then you have entered the Israel Heritage
Classroom. ‘

Dedicated on Nov. 1, 1987, the room is located
in Room 337 of the Cathedral. The result of
almost 20 years of planning, the room contains
architecture and artifacts ranging from the third
century B.C. to the sixth century A.D. ,

The room encompasses the dramatic history of
the land of Israel and its people. It suggests a
dwelling room of the period as well as a modern
classroom. '

.The left, right and rear walls of the room are
lined with second and third century stonework
benches to resemble a bright replica of
Jerusalemrstonework. Encased in glass on the
right wall are two bookcases containing a variety
of Jewish works. The volumesthat were chosen
represent works that were written over ‘the ‘past

three millennia.

On the back and outermost wall is what is
called the Window Wall. There are six windows
capped by white oak shutters on each side. There
is a Hebrew inscription that states the Talmudic
laws for ancient methods of crop-growing for
figs, melons, barley‘ and potatoes. '

The most detailed and intriguing part of the
room is the chalkboard doors that contain a
mosaic painting of the Western Wall.

The design of the chalkboard originated from
the second commandment, stating that there
should be no graven images of likeness. The
designs are copied from what was discovered in
1929, during the excavation of the third-century
Dura Europos Synagogue in the Euphrates val-
ley.

“I love to teach Hebrew in this room,’ said
Ruth Gelman, a Hebrew professor. “It gives my
advanced students the opportunity only to speak
Hebrew, and that in itself adds to the room’s
atmosphere.” I '

Teachers are not the only ones who enjoy the
Israel Heritage Room.

“It is really a long-awaited pleasure to finally
be able to study the language of my heritage in
this room that is so full of heritage,” said junior

where we can influence other members not to mix
sex and alcohol to prevent HIV infection, and we
need to take advantage of that opportunity.”

Sullivan and Goldman, fraternity members and col-
lege friends from Indiana University, began travelling
and delivering their message to college students all

over the country after they had discovered that '

Goldman was HIV positive. They have delivered
their message to over 80 campuses this year.

Goldman said that he feels the program is very
effective because the Greeks can relate to him.'He
said that more people listen if you talk to them rather
than preach.

“I think that everyone thinks that ‘it can’t happen to
me because I’m educated,”’ Goldman said. “That’s
what I thought, but if somebody who I could relate to
told me a story like mine, I would’ve listened.”

Mike Green, a former Theta Chi member and
recovering alcoholic, complemented the AIDS pre-
sentation by delivering an alcohol awareness speech.
Green focused on teaching Greeks to reduce their
alcohol intake rather than to abstain from drinking
entirely.

“This is not an AA program,” Green said. “This is a
program for you to make personal decisions about
alcohol.”

Green defined the social drinker and the alcoholic
drinker and distinguished social drinking from drink-
ing to get drunk; A one—nighter is someone who gets

Almost 10 years ago, Davin
filed for the Workers Alliance
documents through official FBI
channels, citing the Freedom of
Information Act as a source for
him having a right to their
release.

After years of inaction by the
government, Davin sued the
FBI. One of the claims made by
the FBI is that the documents are
law enforcement-related, and
under exceptions in the Freedom
of Information Act, law enforce-
ment records do not have to be
released to private citizens.

“Well, there is a presumption
that all FBI records are law
enforcement records,” said
Marketta Sims, Davin’s attorney.

Sims said that one of the FBI’s_
biggest concerns is that it will .
have to prove that records are
law enforcement in nature every
time an applicant is denied
access to documents under the
FOIA. '

Though the FBI was refused
an appeal by the circuit court, it
has asked for a stay of mandate;
which delays the enforcement of
the court’s ruling until Nov. 13.
At that point, Davin said, the

agency will probably apply for
an appeal to the Supreme Court.

“Department of Justice
lawyers have taken over this case
for the FBI,” Davin said. “And
the Justice Department will get
its day in court, unlike the aver-
age citizen.”

By Nov. 13, the FBI will have
to ﬁle the request with the Justice
Department’s solicitor general,
who will make the decision if the
appeal will be forwarded to the
Supreme Court.

“Their attorneys seemed very
conﬁdent in their request,” said
Sims, who is affiliated with
Pittsburgh law ﬁrm Reed, Shaw,
Smith and McClay. “In the
meantime, I have heard nothing
from the government about
releasing any documents.”

If the appeal is accepted by the
Supreme Court, Davin and his
attorney will lock horns one
more time with the Feds.

If the appeal is refused, or if
the case will not be heard by the
Court, Davin will receive over
10,000 documents, and other
researchers all over the country
could possibly re-apply for docu-
ments that the FBI would not
give out._ ‘

“There is a professor in
Wisconsin that tried to do almost
the same thing that I did,” Davin
said. “I know he is rooting for
me so he can get documents too.
This will set precedent for others
to use.”

Davin says the Workers
Alliance was part of a 40-year
investigation by the FBI, but
there were no arrests, convictions
or indictments. According to
Davin, this makes it hard to
understand how this could still
be considered a law enforcement
investigation.

drunk once in a while but
isn’t necessarily an alco-
holic, he said.

Once the Greeks become
aware of where they are,
they can decide where they
want to be.

“If you choose to drink,
then you should learn how
to drink,” Green said.

Mike Costanzo, Inter-
Fraternity Council vice
president for member educa-
tion, said he feels the annual
program, co—sponsored by
the Panhellenic Association,
is an important event
because it targets pertinent
issues.

Costanzo said new Greek
members must be informed
about these issues so that
they can be prepared when
these situations occur. Greek
101 helps them to do that.

“I think that the Greeks
are in a lot more danger than
independents, because we
are more socially involved,”
Costanzo said. “We are in
more danger, and we need to
be prepared for that.”

Green left the Greeks with
this admonition: “You,are
your brother’s keeper."

One million men...

Today in Washington, Louis Farrakhan hopes to gather 1 mil-
lion black men in a march on the capital. Public opinion about
‘the march is mixed. Many feel the message behind the march is

good, but they do not agree with the messenger. Others believe _

the march is a positive thing for the African-American popula-
tion, hopefully restoring a sense of pride and direction for them.

One thing, however, which has been largely neglected by the
national media is the fact that everyone except black men are
excluded from this event. The Million Man March is supposed to
be just that - 1 million black men. Aside from the exclusion of
any other race or nationality, even black women are being
excluded from the march.

One woman apparently ignored that, saying, “I feel the march
is really about me because black men will be reaffirming their
responsibility for black women and for the black family” (New
York Times. Oct. 13).

It is amazing that the thing most fought for by the African-
American community is being denied to other groups by the

leaders of this march. Women, especially black women, should -

be outraged that they are expected to sit by the road and cheer the
men on. Equality is something that every person, regardless of
gender, deserves.

The message of taking responsibility for one’s actions is
admirable and deserves a 10 million person march. But that is a
message that everyone should be able to spread. It is not a man’s
job to take responsibility for a woman’s actions. There used to be
laws that said it was a man’s duty, but that was in the Middle
Ages —— this is not.

This is a cause which could be successfully furthered if every—.

one united behind it; but excluding women from the fight does
nothing but send mixed messages about who should and should
not take responsibility for their actions.

But what about women?

Though women have been excluded from Farrakhan’s march,
there are other parts of society which hold women and women’s
health in high regard. In the interests of promoting women’s health,
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.» 7 ’

According to the Chicago Tribune, approximately 182,000
women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the next year. Breast
cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and is the
second leading cause of cancer deaths for women. Though breast
cancer is stoppable if it is caught in the early stages, frequently
women do not know they have the cancer until the later stages
when it may be too late to prevent the tumor from spreading.

The best way for a woman to protect herself from fatal breast
cancer is by educating herself. Contact the American Cancer
Society at 261-4352, Women’s Health Services 1-800-426-4636, or

Just gotta have faith... in What?

Do 
have
Dash faith?

Are you sure? Faith is such a
compelling concept to most
humans that it appears to occu-
py a truly central role in peo-
ple’s lives. People seem to
either center their lives around
their own faith, or to occupy
themselves attacking other
people’s faith. I, being the

. modest, objective_obser_ver

that I am, feel stuck in “faith
limbo,” so to speak. I will
show that both of these posi-
tions are pointless, because
either faith does not exist at
all, or it is such a trivial con-
cept that it is nothing like what
we perceive it to be.

Webster matter-of-factly
defines faith as “belief without
proof or evidence.” But which
is it —— “belief without proof”
or “belief without evidence?”
Are these two definitions simi-
lar enough to be included into
a single definition? I think not.
To see this more clearly, ‘we
must consider carefully the
concept of “belief.” So what
does good ole Webster have to
say about that? “Belief. 1(a)
The state of believing.” OK,
skip that one  “l(b) convic-
tion or acceptance that certain
things are true or real.” That’s
better, only “acceptance” is
ambiguous because we
“accept” things all the time
(for the sake of argument, say)
that we don’t truly believe.
Furthermore, “true or real” is
redundant because if some-
thing is real then the proposi-
tion: “that thing is real,” is
true. So something being real
can always be reduced to
something being true.
Therefore, a more reasonable
definition for belief is: “con-
viction that certain things are
true.” ‘

A crucial point is that in
order to truly believe some-
thing, one must first be con-
vinced of its truth, by defini-

tion. That is, belief is a passive

occurrence. One can’t just go
to the “belief store” and pick
out whatever beliefs look
good. Belief is the result of
one’s intellect being forced to
accept a proposition due to the
presence of sufficient evi-
dence. In the same sense. one
can’t truly believe a proposi-
tion merely because one wants
the proposition to be true: You
would love to have a million

. bucks in your right coat pock-

et, but it takes more than that
desire for you to actually
believe that it’s there. Fine.
Now that we understand the
nature of belief, 1et’s reconsid-
er‘ Webster’s definitions for
“faith.”

It is clear that “belief with-
out evidence” is a useless defi-
nition. Such an action in real
life is impossible by the very
definition of belief. That is, it
is impossible to be convinced
of something without the pres-
ence of some evidence. It
would be like “drinking a cold
drink without a cold drink.”
The truth of one notion (drink-
ing 'a cold drink) implies the
existence of the other notion (a
cold drink). Furthermore, even
a less stringent definition, say.
“belief without sufficient evi-
dence” doesn’t make sense,
because without sufficient evi-
dence one still can’t be con-
vinced (by definition of “suffi—
cient”); this would be analo-

gous to “drinking 10 ounces of -

a drink with only 5 ounces of a
drink.” Again, “drinking 10
ounces” implies that there
were 10 ounces to start. Thus.
if this definition is what we
mean by faith, then faith sim-
ply does not exist.

So what about the second
definition: “belief without
proof?” This definition is more
reasonable in the sense that it
is certainly possible to be con-
vinced of something without
having proved it. Consider, for
instance, thebelief that a
weight will fall to the_ earth if
dropped. Everyone believes it,

but on what grounds? We have
empirical evidence; however,
the fact that we have witnessed
some behavior in the past does
not logically imply that this
behavior will continue in the
future. So using this definition,
we conclude that faith surely
exists. However, close inspec-
tion reveals that this definition
leads to a different problem, in
fact exactly the ()pp()Sil‘e prob-
lem as the first. That is, with
this definition essentially all
beliefs are based on faith
because it is so rare that we
truly prove anything — in fact,
only in the abstract realms of
mathematics and symbolic
logic do true proofs occur.
While this definition then
allows for the real existence of
faith, this “faith” has a totally
different meaning from the
common usage.

What, then. is all the to—do
about this obscure concept‘?
Why do so many people use
the word in the most cavalier
sense, as if it were well-
defined, and furthermore sup-
posedly use it as the basis of
their actions? Why do other
people so adamantly reject
faith as if it existed‘? For peo-
ple who purport to hold beliefs
based on faith, there are two
options: Either they do not
truly “believe.” as defined
above, or they are basing their
beliefs on some evidence that
they are not aware of. People
who attack faith are essentially
attacking the act of “drinking a
drink without a drink:" they
fail to realize that the occur-
rence of such an action. even
in principle, is impossible.

Am Ijust making a bunch of
fuss about semantics? My

argument is semantic, but

there is more to it. Define faith
however you like; it’s just a
word, but however you define
it. you must realize that faith
simply is not important.

were exploding fireworks to

watching a bunch of drunken

Now that’s how I want to
spend a Saturday night.

But it was all made worth—
while when the clock struck

something to say — and some-

First Willard wanted to thank
the fans for making this year’s
Midnight‘ Madness the biggest
ever here, and he also wanted to
thank the fans for sticking
through last year’s dismal 10-

that welcomed the then first-

plague of injuries that limited
him to eight players for most of

Soccer upsets No.4 Ruigers

By Mike Kovak and
Mark Gordon
The Pitt News

The Pitt Panther soccer team notched
one of its biggest upsets ever, dropping
nationally ranked powerhouse Rutgers
University 2-0 Friday at Pitt Stadium.

Pitt shutout the No. 4 Scarlet Knights
on goals from junior Matt Gray and fresh-
man Drew Kopp and outstanding play
from goalie Adam Spitzer, who made 10
saves.

night’s game at Pitt Stadium. Pitt defeated the No. 4 ranked Scarlet Knights 2-0.

Owl-t lasted

“This is the biggest win since I’ve been
at Pitt,” said head coach Joe Luxbacher,
who is in his 12th season as Pitt’s coach.
“This should be a tremendous boost for
our program.”

Pitt (8-4 overall, 5-2 in the Big East)
moved into a tie with Boston College for
second place with the win. They are two
points behind Rutgers, whose record
dropped to 5-2 in conference play, 9-2-2
overall. Pitt has 10 points in conference

before halftime when Gray scored on a
pass from senior Todd Graf, who dribbled
the ball right down the middle of the field.

Gray took the shot from 15 yards out on »

the left side of the field at the 41:20 mark.
The icing on a very sweet cake came at
the 61:57 mark, when Kopp scorched the
Rutgers goalie, Steve Widdowson. The
shot sailed over Widdowsons’ head. That
made the score 2-0. Senior Jeff Porter was
credited with an assist on the play.

standings, Rutgers has 12.

The Panthers got on the board shortly

“The second goal was a funny goal,”
Luxbacher said. “Their goalie just wasn’t
anticipating a shot being taken there.”
, Spitzer has recorded four shutouts
, on the season, the most since he pro-
; duced 10 his freshman year. Spitzer
, is second in the Big East in shutouts,
behind Widdowson. He has been in
. the net for every Panther game.

_ “Spitzer has been steady all year.
/ The defense doesn’t give up many
’ shots, either,” Luxbacher said.

The defense also succeeded in
shutting down two of the top four
scorers in the Big East Conference.

“The defense played a hard, tough
game. Real tough defensive play,”
Luxbacher said.

Rutgers forward Hamisi Amani-
Dove, second in the Big East scoring
race, was named Big East Offensive
Player of the Week last week. Pitt
also shut down the Big East’s fourth-
leading scorer, Rocky Strazzella.

“The guys really got after it,”
Luxbacher said. “I couldn’t be any
prouder of their effort.”

The game also featured 22 fouls
on the Panthers, including a yellow
card on marking back J.L. Gorsin.

Temple cleteots Pitt for its
first-ever conference win

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

A dismal season turned very ugly last
Saturday as the Pitt Panther football team
dropped its ﬁfth straight game to the forev-
er-lowly Temple Owls, 29-27, at Veterans
Stadium.

The victory for Temple was its ﬁrst Big
East win in 27 tries. It also snapped a 13-
game losing streak.

“There was a bad start, there was bad ﬁn-
ish, and most of the rriiddle was bad, too,”
said Panther head coach Johnny Majors.

Bad mojo abounded from Pitt’s opening
drive. After Ryan lost three yards on the
first play from scrimmage, he was then
sacked by the Owls’ Willie Brown. Pitt was
faced with a third-and-27. A big play need-
ed to be called, and a QB keeper would be
that play. Ryan netted only one yard on that
carry. ‘

“It doesn’t help your conﬁdence to start
like that,” Majors said.

Pitt’s mojo worsened as Nate Cochran,
by far Pitt’s best player on the field
Saturday, had to punt on the following two
drives.

“I had nine punts. That’s a lot,” Cochran
said. “That” tells a lot about our ineffective-

Wness on offense.” A  V

   

 

Then, Temple got the good mojo work-
ing.

After a few strong runs by fullback Frank
Carter, tailback Eugene Culbreath busted a
33-yard touchdown run. With 1:06 left in
the ﬁrst quarter, Temple led 7-0.

Bad mojo continued to plague the
Panthers on their following drive. A Chris
Patton fumble was recovered by the Owl
defense. Mojo, that damn mojo. Patton led
Pitt with 44 yards worth of rushing mojo.

“The running game is one of the biggest
problems we have,” said Majors. “We are
horrible offensively.”

After the fumble, Temple started at its
own 41-yard line- and proceeded to march
off a series of ﬁrst downs before the drive
stalled at the Pitt 19. Temple kicker Zane
Michalski’s mojo was ﬁne after he booted a
36-yard field goal. Temple led 10-0 with
12:07 remaining in the second period.

Pitt’s mojo started to improve when
Mark Butler returned a punt 74 yards to the
Temple 16. Fullback Chris Schneider kept
his touchdown mojo ﬂowing, as he plunged
over the goal line from 3 yards out. With
5:53 left in thehalf, Pitt trailed by 10-7_.

Sometimes when good mojo gets click-
ing, Pitt gets going. After an interception by

comer Rasshad Whitmill, Pitt was kicking A

The Pitt Lady Panthers volleyball team remained
perfect in the Big East at 3-0 with a pair of confer-
ence wins this weekend against Providence and
Boston College.

The Lady Panthers hosted the Lady Friars of
Providence College Friday night and notched a big

four-game win. Pitt took the first two games by the‘

scores of 16-14 and 15-11, but they dropped the next
game 15-13. Then the Lady Panthers responded with
a 15-5 win in the fourth game to take the match.

“In the match against Providence, we created some
problems for ourselves,” Driscoll said. “We had some
unforced hitting and service errors, but we were defi-

player last Friday night.

nitely the better team.”

The Lady Panthers were again led by their three
veterans: Driscoll (16 kills, .305 hitting percentage)
and seniors Sarah Mikla (18 kills, .300) and Sara
Mitchell (14 kills.) Mitchell’s 32 digs against the
Lady Friars tied a school record for digs in a match._

Lady Panther setter Stephanie Dufresne also played
well Friday night with 62 assists and 20 digs.

Providence was led by Kelly Tooley’s 16 kills and
Kristen Ham’s .333 hitting percentage, but it was not
enough as the Lady Friars dropped to 0-3 in the con-
ference and 14-7 overall. -

The Lady Panthers returned to action Sunday after-
noon, as the Boston College Lady Eagles visited the
Field House. Pitt finished off the Lady Eagles in
quick fashion with a three-game sweep, 15-12, 15-7
"and 15-2, in a match that lasted only one

hour and four minutes.
A major difference in the match was
‘ ’ errors. Boston College racked up 21
errors compared to only six for Pitt.
- Driscoll stepped up again Sunday by
notching 11 kills and hitting .733. This
hitting ‘percentage was good enough for
third best in school history. She also
added five digs and four blocks in the
match.

The only bright spots for the Lady
Eagles were Katherine Tortorello, .333
hitting percentage, and Deanna Herman,
who had 10 kills.

On the weekend, Driscoll had 27 kills,
hit .440, had twoaces, nine digs and six
blocks. These numbers were good
enough to make her a nominee for Big
East Player of the Week.

Pitt went to 10-7 with the win, while
Boston College fell to 9-16 overall. The
1 Lady Eagles are winless so far in the Big
East at 0-3. A

“We feel really great after two wins
this weekend,” Driscoll said. “The older
. players are putting up good numbers, but
- the freshmen have been playing well,
" too. At this point they aren’t even fresh-
men to anyone, they’re just normal play-
ers.”

After dropping five of their first eight
matches of the season, the Lady Panthers
have reeled off seven wins in their last
’ nine contests.

The Lady Panthers are idle until Friday,

its mojo on the Temple 28.

On a third-and-10, John Ryan found receiver
Dietrich Jells for a 28-yard touchdown connection.
Kicker Chris Ferencik must have left his mojo in the
locker room. For the first time this season Ferencik
missed a kick, and Pitt led 13-10 with 2:55 left in the
half.

With 8:35 left in the third quarter, Temple once
again found magic in mojo. They embarked on a
nine-play, 61-yard drive that culminated when 230-
pound fullback Ramod Lee scored his first touch-
down of the game from 1 yard out. There was 2:24
left in the third, and Temple led 17-13.

With‘l0:l4 left in the game, Temple began a drive
at its own nine. After marching to the 45, defensive
lineman Tyler Young intercepted a pass from Temple
QB Henry Burris. The play was set up by pressure
from linebacker Roderick Humphrey.

Young said, “The ball was tipped, and I just threw
my hands in the ai-r. Humphrey should get a lot of
credit for getting the pressure on that play.”

Ryan, who threw for 74 yards, was benched. In
came back-up Pete Gonzalez.

Gonzalez had some mojo with him, and he sparked
the Panthers. After runs by Gonzalez and Harris, the
latter rambled on a 25-yard run that saw him fumble
and pick the ball up himself. Then, Schneider’s touch-
down mojo worked again as he plunged in from the
one to give Pitt a 20-17 lead with 5: 19 remaining.

“Pete gave us a spark,” Cochran said. “Maybe he
should have been put in earlier.”

Controversial mojo reared its ugly head on the kick-
off. Pitt kicker Todd Barton grabbed the facemask of
returner Kevin Walker. Barton yanked Walker to the
ground and subsequently received two personal foul
penalties on the play. Temple started at the Pitt 22-
yard line.

“I couldn’t see it,” Majors said. “It was a critical
penalty, extremely critical; but I couldn’t see it.”

Lee scored from the 15, and the Owls led for good
23-20 with 4:59 left. .

After an interception by Temple linebacker Tealang
Lloyd, Lee once again pounded out a 15-yard touch-
down scamper to give Temple a 29-20 lead. Temple
rushed for 202 yards on the day.

“They just ran the ball on us and hurt us with the
under routes,” Cochran said.

With 12 seconds remaining, Gonzalez found Mark
Butler in the end zone for a 9-yard score, and that set
the ﬁnal score at 29-27. _

Gonzalez, in only seven minutes, threw for 45
yards, one touchdown and one interception.

This Saturday, Pitt entertains the Miami Hurricanes
at noon in the annual homecoming game.

He meant it. I believe him.

Then Willard gave the proof.
He let his thoroughbreds graze
the court.

It was a totally different
team. Only four players return
from last year; the rest of the
roster is filled with talented
freshmen, transfers and, of
course, Ice is back. Jerry
McCullough, Pitt’s ultra-quick
point guard, returns from a
knee injury that he suffered
before last season started.

McCullough showed in,
layups that if he suffers from
any ill effects, it’s not
detectable. The 5-foot-ll
senior took an alley-oop from
Andre Alridge, climbed well
above the rim and threw down
a two-handed mojo.

Others were equally, if not
more, impressive. But what
really made these guys stand
out from the other Pitt teams
were their attitudes. They were
chest—bumping, high-fiving
and high-ﬂying. Anyone at the
gym could sense something
special was happening. You
could hear it in Willard’s voice,

see it in the players’ extra.

bounce and, most importantly,
you could feel it in the gym.

Following layup drills,
Willard took the mike again.
First he pointed out that last
year’s team broke Pitt’s all-
time three-point record. Then
he declared that this year’s
team will break that record
halfway through the season.

He was serious. So is his
team.

“I wasn’t relieved until the
game was over,” Luxbacher
said.

The freshman forward,
Kopp, leads the" Panthers in
scoring. After Friday’s goal,
Kopp now has notched four
goals and one assist for nine
points on the season, which is
good enough for sixth in the
conference. (Two points are
awarded to the goal-scorer,
while one point is given for
the assist.) «

“Drew has been doing his

job, as have all the freshmen,"

but this team isn’t only one or
two guys,” Luxbacher said.
“We’re the type of team that
‘has to go out there and play as
a team every night.”

The victory is Pitt’s second
in the last two weeks over a
top 10 opponent. On‘ the first
day of October, Pitt upset the
eighth-ranked St. John’s Red
Storm, 2-l. Not including Pitt,
which could be ranked after
Friday’s win, the Big East
boasts four teams in the top
25. Boston College and Seton
Hall are ranked 23rd and 17th
respectively. n

-Frompage8

when they travel to West
Virginia to play the Lady
Mountaineers. Following the
trip to Morgantown, Pitt will
visit the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame Sunday in the
first ever Big East match
between the two schools.

The last time these two
schools met, last season, the
Irish bounced the Lady

Panthers from the Sweet 16
of the NCAA tournament.

“It will be tough going into
Notre Dame because that is
where we lost our final match
last season,” Driscoll said.
“We know they’re good, but
we’ve never given them more
thought than any other team.
We will just have to make
some small adjustments here
and there.”
