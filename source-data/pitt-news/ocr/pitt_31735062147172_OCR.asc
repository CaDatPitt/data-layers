Inquiry Speaker
Defends Italian
Stand On War

Mellon Bank Oﬂicial Declares
Mussolini’s Chief Concern
Italy’s Colonial Policy

 

Blames Propaganda

“Italy does not want war merely

for war’s sake.”

Dr. Giacomo Brunetti, head of the
Italian department of the Mellon Na-
tional Bank, pointed this out to the
Inquiry Club Wednesday in its first
meeting of the year.

Italy’s concern in Ethiopia revolves
about questions of “colonial policy”
rather than questions of honor and
glory and the reviving of the old Ro-
man tradition.

Italy wants Ethiopia, or at least a
“protectorate” over the country (1)
because of the imperative need of a
source of raw materials in order to
straighten out the unfavorable bal-
a.iice of trade between Italy and the
nations of the world; and (2) because
the incessant border raids of the
Ethiopian tribesmen into Italian ter-
ritory necessitate a constant outlay of
men and materials by Italy to enforce
favorable conditions.

According to Dr. Brunetti, Italy has
tried time and again by means of con-
cessions and the like to reach some
favorable agreement with Ethiopia to
secure permission to develop the re-
sources of the country. But each time
Ethiopia has either broken the agree-
ments openly or nulliﬁed them by re-
fusing Italian interests physical pos-
session of the concessions.

In voicing these views, Dr. «Bru-
netti revealed the ever-present in-
trigue going on among the larger na-
tions, each jealous of the other, fear-
ful of Italian activity in the East
African country.

The speaker held England to be
the greatest factor in the present
dispute, charging that she has in one
instance, at least, actually incited an
Ethiopian attack on Italian territory.

French interests have also had a
share in the trouble at the border
during the last 20 years. ,

Dr. Brunetti claimed that America
is prejudiced in favor of Ethiopia be-
cause propaganda has been circulated.

He also said that American news-
papers were not telling the truth.
speciﬁcally charging that the full ac-
count of Eamon De Valera’s speech
before the recent League of Nations
meeting was not printed. The full
account, Dr. Brunetti believes, would
have given a completely different iii-
terpretation than the current one.

Ita1y’s interest is not to be con-
strued as carrying the white man’s
burden, but as an imperative need
for a colony capable of sending i-aw
materials to Italy to bring about a
more favorable trade balance.

And Musso1ini’s statements about
the “honor” of the Italian nation are
to be considered as indicative of
Italy’s position with regard to Ethi-
opia’s breaches of concessions. Th-e_y
are not to be thought of as an indi-
cation of a. spirit of revenge for the
military defeat inﬂicted on Italy by
Ethiopia in the late years of last cen-
tury.

Dr. Brunetti came to this coui‘..ti'f.-'
in 1924. During the years 1925 and
1926 he took courses at the Uiiiveisity
in the School of Business Administra-
tioii.

UniversityHistory To Be Compiled;
Old Programs, Bulletins Requested

In preparation for the coming ses-
qui-centennial anniversary on Febru-
ary 28, 1937, of the founding of the
University, Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett,
assistant professor of English, has
been asked by Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor of the University, to organ-
ize aiid write a detailed history of
the University from its beginning as
Pittsburgh Academy, through its re-
establishment as the "\Vesierii Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and conclud-
ing with the development of the Uni-
versity on its present site.

The history will be all-inclusive,
and will be compiled from records
dating back to the time when the Uni-
versity was located at Third avenue
and Cherryalley in downtown Pitts-
burgh.

Much valuable historical informa-
tion has been lost through ﬁres and
frequent moviiigs, and so a great part
of the history will hinge largely upon
assistance alumni and friends of the
University may offer.

Several alumni have already sub-
mitted records and memeiitoes stored
away in attic trunks and old bureau
drawers.

More of such documents—old bul-
letins and catalogs, commencement
programs, old diplomas, notices of
campus activities, pictures of early
students, faculty members, and trus-
tees, or letters, dia.ries_. and memor-
aiida concerning the University—is
requested by Mrs. Starrett.

Material for the history may be left
at her oﬁice, Room 108, State Hall.

Mussolini Finds
Local Defender
---M rs. Dambach

“I agree with ‘Mr, Brun'ett.i that
Italy is perfectly justiﬁed in its stand
regarding Ethiopia,” said Mrs. Jolni
Dambach, wife of the University’s
professor of physical education, and
former graduate student at the Uiii-
versity, Wednesday in commenting on
Bruiietti’s pro-Italy speech before the
Inquiry Forum.

Mrs. Dambach, who made a tour of
seven European countries recently,
was much impressed with Italian
efliciency under a fascist regime, ﬁnd-
ing Italy, she says, by far the best run
of all the countries she visited.

The reason for pro-Ethiopian propa-
ganda iii American newspapers Mrs.
Dambacli lays to British inﬂuence and
to the fact that “Americaiis_ naturally
distrust and would like to get some-
thing on a country with a dictatorial
form of government.”

Americans, Mrs. Dambach claims,
are allowing their sentimentality and
traditional sympathy for the under-
dog to becloud the real issues in the
Italiaii-Ethiopian conflict, and are
making them forget Italy’s economic
need for more colonies.

Dr. 
Traveling Fellowship

Dr. Dorothy Torreyson, instructor of
Spanish at the University last year,
has been granted a traveling fellow-
ship to the University of California
where she will major in Spanish. ,

Dr. Torreyson will take up her
studies either at the branch of the
University at Los Angeles or the
main unit at Berkeley, California.

To ﬁll the vacancy caused by Dr.
'l‘orreyson’s departure, the University
has announced the appointment of
Dr. John R. Bickley. Dr. Bickley has
the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and
Master of Arts from the University
of Missouri and Doctor of Philosophy
from the University of Pittsburgh.

Placement tests for all modern
languages are still being given, ac-
cording to an announcement by Dr.
Shelton, head of the modern language
department. Anyone, who still wishes
to take the test may do so by ar-
rangement with Dr. Shelton at Room
224, Alumni Hall.

Revised Panther
Eleven To Start
Against Prexies

Sutherland Shuﬁies First Team
For Initial Pitt-W&J Battle
‘On Presidents’ Field

For the ﬁrst time since their grid
warfare began back in 1890, a Pitt
varsity eleven invades College Field
tomorrow afternoon for a battle with
Washington and Jeffei'son’s football
team. Tomorrow's clash will mark

the thirty,-third time that teams from
the two schools have met on the grid-
iron. .

When the Panthers trot out on the
ﬁeld for the opening kickoff. at least
four faces that were absent la.st week
are expected to be found in the start-
ing lineup. Vin Sites, senior letter-
man, will take over Eddie Quaranti-
l0’s duties at right end. S-ite’s work
against the lateral passing attacks of
Navy and Nebraska last fall is likely
to prove an asset in ﬁguring out the
President’s tricky “hidden-ball” man-
euvers.

Art Detzel, another senior, has been
working out during the practice ses-
sions this past week at the right
tackle post. George Delich, husky
sophomore lineman, who started at
that position against Waynesburg, has
been temporarily relieved due to a
leg injury and will probably be with-
held from action.

The other changes will be made in
the backﬁeld where Bobby LaRiie, vet-
eran halfback, gets the starting as-
signment at right half,‘ in place of
Leon Shedlosky, and Johnny Michel-
osen calls signals, in place of Arnold
Greene from the quarterback post.

Frank Souchak, who showed ﬂashes
of brilliance in the opener against
Waynesburg, will hold down the left
end job again. Next to him at left
tackle comes Ave _-Daniell, and Biff
Glassford completes the portside tri-
umvirate at the guard position.

Nick Kliskey will handle the snap-
per-back duties, ﬂanked on the right
side by Dante Dalle-Tezze at guard,
Detzel at tackle, and Sites at end.

The backﬁeld will line up with Pat-
rick at fullback, Randour and ‘I.-aRue
a.t left and right halfbacks, respec-
tively, and Michelosen at quarter.

While Coach Day has not ‘deﬁnitely
selected his starting eleven as yet, a
probable lineup will include the fol-
lowing: Hennen and Reed, ends; Cap-
tain Paulekas and "Garvin, tackles;
Slenski and Skulos, guards; Petrecca,
center; Merritt, quarterback; Rosso

Skeptics are spreading malicious
misinformation on this campus.

“You’re going to the t;ollege As-

ask they. “Doii’t be nuts. The News
says that about 400 couples are ex-
pected. How are you going to sur-
vive such a mob without a few broken-
dowii insteps?”

Friends, such un-American chican-
ery on the part of said gossips hurts.
It bores deeply into the noble prin-
ciples 011 which our great couiitry
was founded. It isn’t true. Lies,
nothing but lies.

Yes, 400 couples are expected. But
the Grotto Ballroom on the Northside,
where the Kickoff‘ Informal gets un-
der way at 9 o’clock tonight, will look
barely lialf-ﬁlled, even under an
avalanche of 400 couples.

Back about three years ago when

they experienced one of the greatest

Assembly Begins
Semester, Elects
Ninth Executive

Roberta N ern Chosen To Steering
Body; Harvey Appoints New
Investigating Group

 

Student Faculty Assembly work for
the year began Tuesday evening, when
the group met in the University Club
as dinner guests of Dr. John G. Bow-
man, Chancellor of the University.

Dr_ Bowman, in his address to the
body, stressed the value of spiritual-
ity in the University idea, and said,
“I have come to be1iev_e that kindness
is among the most important things
in life.” . .

“Just how the Student Faculty As-
sociation can bring about a better
feeling on this cam-pus, among stu-
dents and between the student and
faculty, 1 cannot say,” the Chancellor
remarked. “That is your job, and just
sucha group as this is the most ef-
fective body to ﬁnd a way.” .

Following the speech, the Assembly
elected to the Executive Committee
Roberta Nern, C36, who succeeds Mar-
guerite Swank, C36, resigned. In the
special session of the Executive grioup
which followed the Assembly meet-
ing, Miss Nerii was also chosen to‘ ﬁll
Miss S-w,ank’s post as treasurer of the
organization.

Reports on the social committee,
given by Vvilliam McQua.de, E37, and
the book exchange committee, pre-
sented by Leah Stark, C36, were ac-
cepted by the members. Recommen-
dations to the book group were includ-
ed in the motion of acceptance.

-Course Auditing Continues

Auditing of courses by seniors will
be continued this year, William Har-
vey, C36, chairman of the Executive
Committee, informed the Assembly.
‘Fourth-year students desiring to at-
tend courses for which they do not
wish to pay and for which they are
not registered may do so by ﬁling ap-
plication ,,c_ards ,w.i_th____R,egistrar John
G. Quick. Their applications, it was
pointed out, will be approved if they
are carrying the proper academic
load. _'

As indicated in The Pitt News Wed-
nesday, the University library now
opens at 8 o’clock each morning, in-
stead of 8:30. Charles Ebert, C36, re-
ported that the change in hours was
effected aft.er he had consulted John
Weber, University business manager,
on the matter.

Harvey, after discussion of several
minutes, appointed a new committee
headed by Charles Holstein, C36, and
Israel Goldberg, C36, to plan for and
investigate possibilities for new As-
sembly committees. Suggested as a
desirable group which the investiga-
tors might recommend was a student
relations body, which would sponsor
student-faculty forums on varied sub-
jects. , -
The newly chosen committee, which
Miss Tliyrsa VV. Amos, dean of we-
men, said “can ﬁnd out exactly what
opportunities are open to the Student
Faculty Association,” was asked to re-
port at the next Assembly meeting Oc-
tober 22.

A report on the men’s customs and
orientation program was presented b_y
Charles Herald, C36, chairman of the
orientation committee. Herald com-
pared the recommendations of his cus-
toms group last year and the concreti-
zations of its suggestion this semes-
ter.

Messrs. Presidents, Farewell

HEN THE GUN SOUNDS to end the Pitt-

VV&J game tomorrow afternoon a football
_ _ ' relationship of’ great age and ﬁne tradition
will beat an end. Doubtless, University athletic
officials are sorry to see the probable ﬁnish of this
gridiron rivalry, a rivalry that has been truly both
keen and friendly at the same time.

For many years the Pitt-\V&J game was the
classic of the autumn for district football fans.
Overﬂow crowds which gathered annually at
Forbes Field for these games formed strong points
in the decisions which brought about the construc-
tion of the .Stadium.

Few of those who were in the stands during the
two years when the teams fought to scoreless ties
will ever forget the thrill of those powerful out-
its slamming up and down the ﬁeld, working for
the break which never came. Bill Amos, J ap
Douds, Carl Aschman, big Ed Paulie, all these are
names which Pittsburgh fans recall almost as
vividly as those of Panther teams during those two
years.

Again, two years ago, the Presidents rose up in a
mighty eﬂ"ort and held off the snarling Panthers
for 57 minutes of the game, a ﬁeld goal ﬁnally
breaking the ice and leading to a 9-0 Pitt victory.
Now VV&J is continuing its program of deempha-
sizing football and has considered it wise to play
its games with colleges of enrollment relatively
equal to its own.

That fact can not mar any relations between the
two schools. Pittsburgh has a large body of W&J
alumni who are friends of the University. Many
graduates of W&J have entered our School of Law
or School of Medicine to work for advanced de-
grees. There is between the two schools a web of
good feeling which, it is hoped, will carry on with-
out the strengthening stimulus of an autumn foot-

As many Pitt students as possible should make
the short trip to Washington to cheer on the Pan-
thers and say so long to the Presidents. For the
last time, very likely, the \Vash-J eff students will
send rolling across the ﬁeld the verse of:

“‘\V&J was W&J when Pitt was merely WUP
And W&J will be W&J when Pitt is gobbled up.”

Those close to it can have a pardonable pride in
this “Oldest college from the Alleghenies west.”
Pitt wants to keep right on being good friends
with the boys from Little VVashington. But listen,
Presidents, you’re not going to make this one to-
morrow too tough, are you?

Those driving to the game tomorrow may take
heed to a few words concocted by the columnist of
a west coast college paper.

Famous last words: “This car has swell
brakes. It can stop on a dime.” (Crash !)

A word to the wise, it has been said, is often
sufficient.

Colonel Holcombe Has Unusually Fine

Collection Of Literary Masterpieces

Cc py Of La F onta.ine’s Book
Selling For 40, 000 Francs
Contained In Library

Books, hundreds of years old, ﬁrst
editions, classics in ﬁne old covers,
works of masters with priceless etch-
ings of world-famous artists——all can
be found in the library of Colonel
John L. Holcombe, newly appointed
head of the University department of
military science.

Although an hour late for their ap-
pointment at the Colonel's home, the
two reporters of The Pitt News were
genially greeted as they entered the
house. Saracen knights guarded the
hallway and countless historical
weapons—guns, knives, sabers-—hung
over the shelves of the books, as
though protecting them from attacks
of untested contemporary literature.

While the Colonel appreciates that
there undoubtedly is merit in some
present-day literature, he feels that
there is so much chaff among it that
it would be a waste of time to attempt
to ﬁnd the best. He says, however,
that he has read every book that has

,cott’s “Phillip the Second,”

passed down the ages as a classic.

The books in the Colonel's collec-
tion bear out this contention. There
are volumes of Homer, Herodotus.
Machiavelli. Boccaccio, Chaucer, Bal-
zac, Rousseau, Ben Jonson, Polybus,
La Fontaine, Shakespeare, Samuel
Johnson, and Moliere. All told, there
are about 6,000 volumes of classics
and historical works, all of which
Colonel Holcombe has read or re-
ferred to.

Perhaps the most valuablewvolunie
in the collection, as regards.-mdnetary
standards, is an edition of La Fon-
taine’s “Fables,” an almost identical
copy of which recently sold in Paris
for 40,000 francs. The most valued
for sentimental reasons is a copy of
the “Memoirs” of the Empress Jose-
phine, given to Holcombe by his
grandmother 40 years ago, and in-
trusted to him to pass to posterity
through his son.

The Colonel has not made

1935 Graduates

Teachers Appointment
Bureau Makes Best
Record Since ’30

Of encouraging interest to students
in the School of Education is the re-
cent list of graduates of that school
placed by the Teachers Appointment
Bureau.

According to Mr. Theodore A. Sic-
dle, acting director of the Bureau,
more recent graduates have been
placed in teaching positions this year
crease over last year is slight, but
than at any time since 1930. The in-
suflicient to justify a more optimistic
outlook for the future, Mr, Siedle be-
lieves.

Bureau statistics reveal that 45 per
cent of the graduates of the February,
June, and August, 1935, classes from
the School of Education are engaged
in the profession for which they pre-
pared; that two per cent have mar-
ried since being graduated; and that
four per cent have entered other
kinds of work.

Most of the placements were in the
special ﬁelds of commercial, physical,
and elementary education. There is
still little activity in the general aca-
demic ﬁelds in the high school. The
few vacancies that do occur, Mr. Sie-
dle indicated, seem to go to “home
town” teachers or experienced teach-
ers with advanced preparation.

Among the recent graduates placed
are: Grace Ackard, commercial, West-
minster College; Clara Ertman, com-
mercial, Turtle Creek Union High
School, Edith Kerschner, commercial,
Penn Township Schools, Butler Coun-
ty; Orpha Leighty, Cecil Township
High School, McDonald; Nelson Mills,

geography, Springdale High School,

mercial, Mrs. Pinkerton’s School,

ary, Conway; Frances Dent, physical
education, Shaler Township, Glen-
shaw.

mercial, Etna High School; Rosemary

commercial, Dale Borough High
School, Johnstown; Vlfonnetah Parks,

High School; Lillian Ziegler, element-
ary, Coraopolis; Lillian Smith, ele-
mentary, West Deer Township; John
Ramsey, vocational, Scott Township.

In addition to the foregoing persons
in full-time teaching positions, many
other recent graduates taught summer
high school in Pittsburgh, and these,
as well as more University of Pitts-
burgh-prepared teachers, are on the
faculties of the Pittsburgh Evening
Schools.

lVork Continued
On Cathedral

Construction of partitions on the
first, second, and third floors of the
Belleﬁeld Street wing of the Cathe-
dral is being continued, according to
John VVeber, business manager of the
University.

The plastering of the fourth, ﬁfth,
and sixth ﬂoors, site of the future
University library, is also being com-
pleted. In addition, radiators, pipes.
and electric wiring are being installed
in preparation for winter.

Work on the Heinz Memorial Chapel
is being held up, pending the arrival
of the special stained glass to be
used in the windows. The entire
chapel will be completed as soon as
possible after Mr. Weber makes the
necessary arrangements for the glass
with Howard Heinz, Jr., donor of the
memorial.

What? A League
Of Nations Yet .’
Glance At This

By Leo Hollein

Every University student cannot
boastfully trace his family tree back
to that day when a great-great-grand
daddy leaped onto Plymouth rock
after a pleasant crossing on the S. S.
Mayﬂower; nor can he, in truth,
claim that his not-so-far-off ancestors
met the boat when it dropped anchor
on that historic date. This privilege,
if it is a privilege, is reserved for the
very few.

But what of the parents of the
other students-—fron1 whence come
they? Five hundred thirty-four par-
ents of undergraduate students at the
University—-by far the largest num-
ber—come from the land of the sickle
and sledge, Russia; while tiny Luxem-
bourg, sandwiched in between Ger-
many and Holland, furnished only one
parent.

Sunny Italy is second in the list
of nations from which University stu-
dents descend, with 319 fathers and
mothers, followed in decreasing num-
bers by Poland, 163; Austria, Eng-
land, (including Wales), Germany
and Czechoslovakia totaling 155 from
each; and Hungary with 139.

Jugoslavia combining Ukranians,
Serbs and Cro_atians, is the birthplace
of 114 parents. Lithuania, the country
that pays its national debts with
monotonous regularity, is responsible
for 100 parents, Ireland 97, Roumania
56, Scotla.nd 52, Sweden 46, and Greece
44.

Our very good friend from the
north, Canada, has sent to us 37 par-
ents of Pitt students, in contrast to
the eight parents from distant China.
Among the nations sending but a few
of their number are Finland with 6,
Spain 5, Norway 5, and Denmark 3.

Just as all the parents of under-

graduate students were not born in

the United States, so all the students
themselves were not born under the
stars and stripes.

Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Mexico,
Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Cuba, Bul-
garia, Africa, and Roumania were
each the birthplace of one student
now present in the University.

Russia, the nation that heads the
list with the number of parents bQ_r_';
there, leads also with the number of
students, with eight being born
there. Just as with parents, Italy is
second, with seven native born sons
and daughters. Canada ties with
Italy.

Poland, Austria, Greece, England,
and Jugoslavia are represented at the
University, each country having three
students present.

University Host
To Slav Prelate
On Recent Visit

The University played host to an-
other distinguished visitor Monday, as
Archbishop Gregory Rozman of Yugo-
slavia made a tour of the ground,
while on an inspection trip of Pitts-
burgh points of interest.

The churchman, who is the Arch-
bishop of Slovenia, one of the states
which make ‘up the Kingdom of Yu-
goslavia, stopped off in Pittsburgh, en-
route from the Eucharistic Congress
in Cleveland, which he attended as a
representative of Slovenia.

Archbishop Rozman inspected the
Cathedral of Learning, and saw the
view from its top ﬂoors. He showed
special interest in the design for the
Yugoslav room in the Cathedral. He
was greatly impressed by his trip
through the tallest college building in
the world.

The Archbishop formerly taught at
the University of Ljubljana, Yugo-
slavia, where he now makes his home.
He was conducted through the Uni-
versity by Rev. Matthew Kebe, who
is the member of the committee for
the Yugoslav room.

For the room sponsored by the peo-
ple of his nationality, Archbishop Roz-
man will send two paintings by Slo-
venian artists to add to the Yugoslav
atmosphere. He is now on the way
back to Slovania, after making a three-
day inspection trip of Pittsburgh.

Collector Says ModernNovel
Has Too Much Chaﬁln It

For Serious Reading

Davis, Marshall Suchet’s “War in
Spain” (1829), Johnson’s “Lives of
the Poets” (1803), and Hubert How-
a.rd's “Edition of Bancroft’s Vvorks"
(1833). He also has a second edition
of the works of Thomas Carlysle.

History is the Colonels chief inter-
est, but he has studied literature, in
order, he says, “ . . to know the
philosophy of the people whose his-
tory I study.” Many of the volumes
in the collection are in the original
language. Colonel Holcombe has a
ﬂuent command of Spanish, Italian
and French and a reading use of
Latin. He prefers the original lan-
guage rather than translation.

The correspondents left the silent,
museum-like house on Denniston Ave.
with an appreciation of the extensive
library and the vast knowledge be-
hind Colonel Holcombe’s army-ofﬁcer
exterior.

fullback.

Paulekas and McBurney, both veter-
ans, gave good accounts of themselves
in last year’s Pitt-Wash-Jeff struggle.
The former held down the center po-
.sition but was converted into a tackle
this fall. McBurney, fullback, follows
in the footsteps of other great Red
and Black line plungers who have
caused the Panthers plenty of trouble
in the past. A few years back it was
Bill Amos; two years ago it was a
gentleman by the name of King. To-
morrow it may be McBurney. ‘

Don Croft, appropriately titled the
Sharon speedster, is reported to be on
the hospital list. However, he may
get in the game tomorrow. Croft sur-
prised the Pitt boys last year by turn-
ing in a neat 87-yard jaunt to dent the
Panther goal line for VV. & J.’s lone
marker.

The Presidents have not won a pig-
skin engagement from Pitt since 1923,
when they handed out a 10-0 defeat.
In ’26 and '27 two tie games were
played, but since that time it has been
all Pitt. Last year the ﬁnal score was
26-6. Of the 32 games played between
the two teams, the Panthers have won
the decision on 18 occasions, while
the Presidents have tasted victory 12
times, the other contests ending in
deadlocks.

Due to a new athletic policy initiat-

ed down at the Washington County in-_

stitution, the game tomorrow may be
the last one to be scheduled between
the two schools.

The Panthers will leave for Wash-
ington late tomorrow morning, arriv-
ing there shortly before game-time.
Immediately after the ﬁnal gun
sounds, the locals will pack bag and
baggage and head for Pittsburgh.

According to James lHagan, gradu-
ate manager of athletics, Coach Suth-
erland will take a little more than
three full teams down to Washington
for the game.

Kickoff is scheduled for 2 o’clock.

their doors to see what in tarnation
is the matter when the University
Band swings down the ﬁeld tomorrow
afternoon with brasses booming and
drums rolling.

Making their ﬁrst appearance on
foreign soil, the band members are
out to show everyone concerned that
their unit performs as well abroad as
it does at home, according to a couple
of fellows near the middle of the clar-
inet section. The full band, compris-
ing 120 pieces, will make the trip by
bus and private machines.

Mr. Lee M. Lockhart, director of
the unit, is continuing his plans for
organizing a “B” Band. This outﬁt
does not take part in any marching
maneuvers, but its members are pre-
pared to ﬁll any vacancies occurring
in the ﬁrst-string unit.

Students interested in playing in
the “practice” band, a unit designed
primarily for beginning musicians,
are still welcomed by Director Lock-
hart. Some instruments owned by
the University are available for use.

Varsity, Frosh Swimming
Practice Gets Under Way

Pat Corr lost little time in getting
the varsity and freshman swimming
teams off to a ﬂying start at the ﬁrst
practice of the year Tuesday after-
noon. Every candidate was timed in-
a. 100-yard freestyle race.

Although no remarkable times were
turned in, the average time was some-
what better than expected for the
first drill. Captain Russell Lindberg
gave the 33 freshman candidates an
idea as to how the race should be
handled when he ﬁnished the distance
in 53 seconds.

Any student in the University who
desires to try out for the team is re-
quested to report to Trees Gymnasium,
Monday or Tuesday afternoon at 5
o’clock. Students interested in the
managerial end of the team are also
requested to report to the pool on
Monday afternoon at 4:15 o’clock.

'2 For Coed Dance

 

Bradley’s Band To Furnish Music;
Paper For I-Iats Now On Sale
In Alumni Hall, Cathedral

Once more the freshman women
and new transfers pull out their sum-
mer formals and meet their dates for
the Co-ed Prom, VVomen’s Athletic
Association's annual classic on next
Wednesday evening. But this time
they’ll foot it at the University Club,
the entire second floor of this place
having been given up that evening
for the Prom.

The upperclass women will borrow
their big brother’s white flannels and
dark coats for this event, for it has
been ruled by the WAA Board that
both the “men” and the women must
wear summer formals.

In addition to their long dresses,
the freshmen will wear garden hats
of their own making—blue. and gold
crepe-paper hats. There will be two
prizes given, one for the most orig-
inal hat, and one for the most clever.

The dance will get under way at 7
o’clock to the strains of Howdy Brad-
ley’s music, a.nd will ﬁnish at 10
o’clock promptly. There will be a
program and a stag-line, the latter to
be composed of senior mentors and
WAA Board members. _

Material for the hats IS on sale
now at the VVAA sandwich stands, in
Alumni Hall and tenth ﬂoor Cathe-
dral. Five cents will be charged for
two sheets, one of blue and one of
gold. .

Escorts for the freshmen will be
-secured through the senior mentors
only, according to a new ru‘a.inv.

before local organizations and the in-
tercollegiate debating both at home
and abroad, the team for each debate
being selected after preliminary try-
outs open to every member of the as-
sociation.

tions. Books and pamphlets are

School Girls Of India Keep
Pace With American Coeds

- By Frances Unseld
“College girls in India are more likecollege girls in the United States
than diﬁerent from them,” said Miss Dorcas Hall, graduate assistant in the
Dean of Women's ofﬁce, in answer to the question how Indian school girls

differed from American coeds.

Crushes, school girl peeves, and borrowing

clothes are as prevalent in India as in Kalamazoo, according to Miss Hall,
who has been in charge of the Christian Normal School at Khandwa, India,

for the past ﬁve and one-half years.

Ball room dancing for men and woe

men is almost non-existent among na-
tive Indians. “But,” added Miss Hall,
“we have no trouble getting our girls
to go to Epworth League or to Prayer

Meeting." ‘But there’s a reason:
that’s where the boys go. Instead of
exchanging names over a “coke,”

Hindu boys and girls glance at each
other from behind hymn books and
become acquainted over the discus-
sion of the League’s coming Christ-
mas pageant.

Soda fountains are a rarity in In-
dia, so much so, added Miss Hall, that
when Americans reach Calcutta (the
soda oasis) they have been known to
indulge in three and four of the Amer-
ican concoctions in one hour. Pea-
nuts, however, are the vogue among
all ages, and when Johnny wishes to
be particularly nice to his Mary, he
presents her with a sack of salted
nuts.

Style and this year's fashion trend
is as much a subject of polite conver-
sation with an Indian college girl as
with any Vassarite. The saris, worn
by all the native girls, consists of
six yards of material draped from the
ankle over the shoulders in Grecian
style. W'hen Chanel of Paris predicts
the swagger back for the winter sea-
son, the saris all hang in loose folds
away from the ﬁgure; and. when
Adrian dresses Joan Crawford in a
high waist line, the draped ends of
the sari go up from knee length to a
normal waist’ line. ‘

Physical Exams Required
Of All Transfer Women

Dr. Auleene Marley Jamieson, Di-
rector" of Women’s Student Health
Service, requested yesterday that all
transfer women who have not had
physical examinations call at her of-
ﬁce at Room 222, Alumni Hall and

make appointments.

Examinations are required, regard-
less of the fact that transfers may
have had physical examinations in
other schools.

these girls. They adorn their arms
and throats with bracelets and beads
of solid gold, almost completely un-
alloyed. The more bracelets an In-
dian miss dispays from waist to elbow
the greater her social . . and inci-
dentally her ﬁnancial standing.

“No, the Hindu girl doesn’t use

cosmetics, not as the American girl
knows them,” said Miss Hall, “but she
does use beauty artiﬁces.” The tika.
somewhat analagous to our beauty
mark, is a red spot worn directly in
the middle of a girl's forehead when
she wishes to be particularly dressed
up. The married women wear red
powder in the parts of their hair and
all the women and girls outline the
bottoms of their sandaled feet with
the same red powder.

, In India all women part their heavy
black hair directly in the middle. But
when one girl is peeved with another
she immediately combs her hair
straight back without any part. This
is Indian Mary’s way of notifying her
school mates that she has quarreled
with‘ Susan. The braids and wind-
blowns, and hangs effected by Ameri-
can girls would make a change in the
parting of the hair go unnoticed. But
when American Jane starts luncheon
dating with Dot’s Johnny, it’s pretty
certain that Jane and Dot have phffft!
And though the reactions are obvious-
iy different, psychologists would have
it that they are both the result of
the same stimuli. Indian girls aren’t
so different!
