Pitt Greeks plan to raise
$75,000 to benefit the Western
Pennsylvania School for Blind
Children this year as part of their
annual Greek Week.

”This year's Greek Week
promises to be more successful
than any other, due to the dedi- -

”The biggest thing about this

Brody. ”A lot of times in the past,
you're raising money, and it

you to raise money for a faceless

where the money is going.”

Hunn agreed, ”We’re going to
have the Greeks come here,

WASHINGTON —— Secretary of

State George P. Shultz indicated
Sunday that if Soviet leader Mik-
hail Gorbachev continues to put
obstacles in the way of an arms
control agreement, a U.S.—Soviet
summit might not occur in the
Reagan presidency. 9

”We’lI have it when he's ready
or, if he waits too long, maybe we
won't be ready,” Shultz said on
NBC—TV’s ”Meet the Press,” one
day after returning from two days
of talks in Moscow.

”This administration ends in
January 1989. And as you get into
the heat of the election cam-
paign, it’s no time for a Soviet
leader to be here,” Shultz added.

”So_there’s only a finite amount
of time, only a finite amount of‘
patience with all of this.” ,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze raised the topic of
a summit this fall during meetings
in Washington in September,
Shultz said, adding that during
talks in Moscow last week, Gor-
bachev suggested that President‘

_ Reagan visit the Soviet Union

next year.
- ”We discussed it. Not only a
summit here, but he clearly has
in his mind President Reagan"
coming to Moscow -next year,
which is fine if we have some-
thing worthwhile to do,” Shultz
said. ”But then he somehow isn't
quite comfortable, he hasn't
made up his mind.” I
Administration officials had

voiced puzzlement at Gor-
bachev’s sudden refusal Friday to
fix a date for a summit, but em-
phasized -that the decision should

not block a treaty banning

intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.

Shultz said Sunday the ad-
ministration was willing to sign a
treaty with the Soviets, even
without a superpower summit
meeting, and he said he remains
optimistic about such an
agreement.

”We have basically worked out
practically all the problems and
our negotiators will be back,”
Shultz said. However, he point-
ed out that the Soviets ”can
change their minds. But what we
should do is not be thrown off by
them changing their minds."

”We have to stay on our track,
and when they're ready to sign,
fine we'll be there,” he added.

The treaty, applying to missiles

mostly based i_n Europe, was the‘  ‘

projected centerpiece of the next
summit meeting between Reagan

-and Gorbachev. The two have

met face-to-face twice before in
Geneva in November 1985 and
in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October
1986. ‘

Frank C. Carlucci, the national
security adviser who accompa-

nied Shultz on the trip to‘
Moscow, said Sunday Soviet’

leaders indicated that they would  ., ._

Pitt faculty dean honored at governor's luncheon

By Chih-Cheng Yen

Staff Writer

Elizabeth Urey Baranger-, dean of gradu-
ate studies for the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and
professor of physics, was named one of
the seven 1987 Distinguished Daughters
of Pennslyvania at an awards luncheon
recently held at the governor's residence
in Harrisburg.

”For 39 years, we have honored out-
standing Pennsylvania women ‘for their
personal accomplishments which have

benefited mankind and brought honor to I

their families,_ communities and the
state,” said Governor Casey.

Women are nominated for the award,

by organizations within the Common-
wealth and Distinguished Daughters of

yesteryear. Of the nominees this year,
three were Pittsburgh women.

Baranger, an internationally known"

nuclear physicist, was at MIT from 1969

‘to 1973, where she did research and

taught, but came to Pitt because she was
offered an opportunity todo administra-
tive work in the graduate school.

’’I wanted to become interested in a
wider variety of issues,” she said. ”I want-
ed to interact with people and students
and try to make an impact on programs
at Pitt.” Baranger was named to her cur-
rent position in 1978.

Baranger said she was pleased with the
award and stressed the importance of-
recognition for women's accomplish-
ments. ”Itam grateful to them for think-
ing of me,” she said. _

Baranger-is the‘ daughter of Nobel Prize .

 

winner Harold Urey, one of the world's
pioneers in nuclear science. ”I grew up
in an atmosphere of science,” she said.

Baranger graduated from Swarthmore
College with high honors in 1949 and
received her Ph.D. in physics from Cor-
nell University four years later. She did
her post-doctorate research in nuclear
physics at Caltech.

”I was a math major at Swarthmore, but
I realised that I would not be able to do
math research,” she said. ’’I was attract-
ed to ‘nuclear physicsbecause at that time,
it was a very exciting field. And there
were very few women in- physics.”

Baranger is the first chairperson of the
Committee on the Status of Women in
Physics. She serves on_the‘Council of the

American, Association for the Advance:
ment ‘of Science and is also ja. fellow of

    

the association. She also serves on the
American University Women's Commitee-

on Fellowships to American Women. She

has published widely in the field of. . *0

nuclear physics and higher education.

Baranger said she is especially interest-

ed in attracting women to graduate school
and particularly to science. She said she
was influenced by her father, who be-
Iieved ‘ that ’’all people should study

science, and all women should get 

Ph.D.s.” \ _
’’It is important for women to go into

science,” she said. ’’It is an excitingIfieI.d,. I_

and we need to develop this under-

utilized national resource. I think that all ,
people should go tograduate s,cho,ol.-_”_ 71

_WASHINGTON — In a de-

lvelopment that won't cheer

Republicans hoping to hold onto
the White House, many of the na-
tion's economists are sharply

‘reducing their 1988 forecasts

with some even predicting a mild

j recession early next year.

Those economists who are not
forecasting an outright recession
believe that economic activity
will be much weaker than they
had expected before the record-
shattering plunge of the stock
market.

The reason for the pessimism is
a belief that consumers will feel
poorer following the market's big
plunge, which wiped out $500
billion in wealth in a single day.
- ”The future has become much
more uncertain. None of us has
lived through anything like this
before,” said Lyle Gramley, a
former member of the Federal
Reserve Board and now chief
economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association. ”The big
question is what this stock mar-
ket volatility will do to the confi-

dence of consumers and their

willingness to spend.”

Economists at Data Resources

economic consulting firms, said

New publication to
track AIDS litigation

-EDG EMONT, Pa. —— Attorneys
and others involved in the grow-
ing number of AIDS-related
lawsuits soon will be able to keep
up with court developments in a
new legal publication that will

track such litigation nationwide. ‘

The.biweekly AIDS Litigation
Reporter will be launched Nov.
13 by Andrews Publications Inc.
and be geared toward attorneys
and businessmen,‘ said Arthur

McGuire, assistant managing
editor.

The journal will carry the full
texts of important AIDS-related
court opinions and will report on
step—by—step developments in key
cases. '

The number of AlDS—related
lawsuits has grown tremendous-
Iy, prompting the need for AIDS
Litigation Reporter, McGuire
said. Nearly 400 AlDS—related
suits are pending in courts, and
at least 150 have been filed
against blood banks and plasma
manufacturers, he said.

”Whenever litigation is emerg-
ing very quickly, we find that at-
torneys and businessmen need to

follow the cases,” said McGuire. .

”They can't afford to wait weeks
or months to get the documents
in their. hands.”

The first 20 pages of the

68—page magazine will offer sum-

maries of major cases developing
within the past two weeks,
McGuire said. Another section
will include verbatim court ord-
ers and decisions, lawyers’ peti-
tions and docket sheets.

Soviets working on

WASHINGTON —— Disclosure
last week of new details of Soviet

political significance on Friday as
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev

President Reagan agreed to curb

known as ”Star Wars.” Reagan
has steadfastly refused Soviet de-

GM-UA W reach pact
on work agreement

DETROIT —— United Auto Wor-
kers members overwhelmingly
approved a new three—year con-
tract with General Motors Corp.
that protects union jobs while
freeing GM to seek looser work
rules, the UAW announced Sun-
day night.

UAW members at 152 locals
nationwide voted'80.7 percent in
favor of the agreement, said
UAW spokesman Frank Joyce.

GM has been notified of the
ratification, which means the
contract takes effect Monday,
Joyce said.

Ratification had never ap-
peared to be in doubt. Most
resistance came from workers at
plants GM plans to close by the
end of 1990.

600 middle school

students tour Pitt

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

Six hundred students and
faculty of the Fort Couch Middle

- School left their classes on Thurs-

day to be the largest tour group
ever to walk through Pitt.

The field trip was created
through Pitt's Outreach Pro-
grams, to foster a greater aware-
ness of the opportunities Pitt
offers to area students, according
to Jim O'Brien, assistant director
for the Outreach Program.

O'Brien said that the prime ob-
jective of the trip was to guide
middle and junior high school
students toward higher edu-
cation.

”We’re opening up a lot of
doors at the University of Pitts-
burgh,” said O’Brien.”These kids

‘coming in, many of them and

their parents have never been be-
hihd all the doors they're going

to be going through on a field trip

like this.”

Fort Couch students and faculty
began the tour at 10 a.m. at Pitt's
Fitzgerald Field House. Students
were introduced to Pitt coaches
and participated in two mini-
clinics for either basketball,
wrestling, soccer, gymnastics,
volleyball or strength and condi-
tioning.

At 11 a.m. the tour proceeded
to Trees Hall where the Pitt div-
ing team performed a diving ex-
hibition. At 11:20 a.m.lunch was

served at Pitt Stadium.

After lunch, the middle school
students split up and attended
half-hour sessions held at the Pitt

. schools which interested them.

Representatives from schools of
Law, Dentistry, Business, Phar-
macy, Social Work, Nursing, En-
gineering and Education talked
with students and answered
questions.

At 1 p.m., the students and
faculty were given a brief tour of
the Cathedral of Learning, fol-
lowed by an organ recital at
Heinz Chapel. The tour official-
ly ended at 2 p.m.

Tom Harshman, principal of
Fort Couch Middle School said
he was pleased with the trip.

”The kids are hearing the right
things,” said Harshman. ”Every-‘J
one’s telling them they have to
start making up theirminds now
that they're going to be serious
students, that they have to get it

together if they're going to go to _

a place like this [Pitt .”- A

’’I want to study medicine,”
said Jeff Barbarita, a seventh
grader at the middle school. ’’I’m
still not sure what kind of doctor
I want to be.”

Coleen Flaherty said she was
impressed with the ‘tour and is
considering attending Pitt in the
future. ”The campus is beauti-
ful,” she said. ’.’I like the
Cathedral [of Learning] a lot.”

Because the Talent Show is
not a contest, the contestants
were encouraged to express
their abilities without fear of
competition. This year's acts
-ranged from the mellow and
acoustic, to rap messages,
high—energy jazz and rock ’n’
roll. The acts used original

' music, their favorite artists or

they used a diaoblo, which is ‘

what juggler Jeff Mason used
as one of his props.

The diaoblo is a gyrating
rubber mechanism upon a
string connected by two
pieces of wood.

’’I wanted to make them go
WOW!” Jeff said before the
show.

The crowd responded

warmly to the diaoblo though,
many of them didn't know’

what it was.

A few of the acts‘ including
Frankie and ‘Annette, T.L.B.,
and Pat Boyle performed origi-
nal material well-liked by the
audience in pop, rap and
comic acoustic music. Fanta-
sia, Mel Mapel (and David
Jefferson demonstrated ver-
sions of their favorite artists.

One of the more unique
musical talents was Jazz Dis-
covery. This high—energy jazz
fusion group excited the au-
dience with their covers of
David Sanborn and Spyro
Gyra selections.

The school is ‘celebrating’ its
Centennial this year. Founded in
1887, the school services chil-

dren between the ages of two and

21. It no longer serves blind chil-
dren only, however, but also chil-
dren with other physical
handicaps. The school is under

going a rebuilding program in’

which 66,000 square feet of new
space is- being built, consisting of

classrooms, therapy areas, and a"

swimming pool. An old building
is also beingvconverted into a dor-
mitory. The cost of these renova-
tions should be around $9
million. ‘

”This is really an exciting‘ year
for all of you to get involved with
the school because you can be-
come a part of our move into the
second century,” said the

school's Public information.

Officer Rosanne DiCola. ”And

the school, part of the campus

BETWEEN THE LINES

I'm no stranger to stress. Near-

ly every aspect of my profession-
‘al life is governed by strict
deadlines. And the very fact that
my professional life takes up so
much of my total time sets up

deadline pressure in my personal,

life as well.

The scene goes something like
this: Let's say, in my two spare
hours on Sunday, I have to pay
my bills, have my clothes laun-

1-dered and re—acquaint .myself

with my girlfriend, of whom I'd
lost track during the preceding

5 week.

Faced with this kind of situa-
tion, I often end up doing two or
’ three things at once, and every-

. thing manages to get accom-
L plished. Such is the life of the
« achievement—oriented, tension

junky. But I'm not alone in this.
Most professional people these
. days find themselves faced with
the same type of dilemma.
The reason I'm thinking about
i stress these days is because, re-
’ cently, one of my friends had
V been hospitalized due to a stress-
j related breakdown. It was not a
. pretty thing.
i _ A few years back, when I was
'-‘attending a highly competitive,
f. private university, I went for a
r regular physical exam. and told

   

5. mydoctor that I felt OK but had '
-- toldo something a,bovu.t,tlhge,V_str,e_ss.

in my life.

The stress I've spoken of had
arisen from a strong desire to do
well in competition with people
who had been used to being "the
best” all their lives. Out of this
group, only one could be the
best. And someone had to be the
worst of the better. This, as you
can imagine, pushed the mini-
mum level of performance up
and eventually, to put it in au-
tomotive terms, I found myself
automatically "red-lining." In that
kind of environment, it doesn't
take long until you blow your en-
gine completely.

After a brief chat, my doctor ex-
plained a few things to me about
stress.

First, he explained, there was
no way of eliminating stress from

my daily life. In fact, he said, he-

doubted that I would want to do
so, even .if given the chance. A
healthylevel of pressure is good.
It pushes people to perform well
and to stretch themselves in ways
they never thought possible. Bas-

ically, life is stressful, like it or‘

not. ’

_ Next, he said it was important
for me to realize that stressors are
neutral. The key, he said, is how
a person reacts to them. Did you
ever wonder why somebody is
able to sit atop a multi-billion-
dollar corporate empire in the
midst of a hostile takeover and
not sweat it, while another per-
son fails a calculus test in school
and goes to pieces?

So far, we've talked about
negative stressors. Don't be
fooled, however. Stress isn't the
by-product of only negative hap-
penings. Successes can be the
most stressful experiences of all
—— with their constant demands
and, of course, the curse of the
"golden ladder": the higher you
climb, the more people see your

ass. This kind of scruti‘ny‘has"‘
ruined many otherwise, vstrorigjj "
.and goo'd’peop'l"

I'm probably the last person
who should be telling anyone
about how to deal with stress.
Everyday I learn more about it,
but I still haven't mastered the
technique. -

One way I" try to deal with

stress is to maintain a positive’

se|f—image, to be good to myself.
I also have learned to divorce my-
self from my creations. If I write
a column or an article that I'm not
particularly pleased with, that
doesn't mean I've lost my touch
or that I never had the touch. It
just means that I wrote a column
or article that I'm not particular-
ly pleased with.

It has taken me a long time to

realize that I judge myself much '

more harshly than ‘most of my

professional associates. I work at .

quelling my perfectionistic mind-
set." Some details just aren't worth
the time spent hammering/-away
at them.__ ' ,
When it comes to the break-
downs of others, I hear many
people scoff. ‘I try not to do this.
I realize that, given the right col-
lection of stressors, all converg-
ing at the same time, the potential
for such an occurrence exists for

 One step over the line, sweet Jesus .

all of us. »

While visiting my friend in_ the

hospital in the days following his
breakdown, I was overcome by
a sense of frustration. Observing
the people who were on the floor

with him — people with mental .
and emotional problems of a ,

much more severe and, in many
cases, organic nature made me
realizelhow’ much‘ he didn't be-
long there.

Hesimply had allowed himself '

to be overcome by._attempts to
find answers to problems that
were not solvable and efforts to
handle situations that were real-
ly out of his control. He wasn't
crazy — or at least no crazier than
I am when I'm finishing a final
draft of an article an hour before

‘deadline and the thinglgets lost
,in the computer. -Those things

happen. How you react to them
is the key. '

In the end, I think, people must I-

realize that they succeed and fail
in life in spite of their personal
standards and not necessarily be-
cause of them. So why kill your-
self, literally orfiguratively. Ijust
keep plugging away. '

Just a chilling thought to begin
this article. The reader is som-
where near Khuzestan in Iran,
standing around with thousands
of Iranian soldiers waiting for a
meager, warm meal served out of
trucks. Most of the "soldiers”
around you are younger than 18.

Most of you are pretty out of it
from malnutrition, fatigue and the
exertions of a Middle Eastern
summer. When one more jet flies
over the troop concentration, no
one really cares. No explosions
are heard. It's just one more jet.

Then, without warning, people
all around you aresuddenly vio-

_lently ill. Many soldietswaippeair to"

develops pus-filled blisters; others
are convulsing. Many others are

It took me a pot of coffee and
a half a pack of cigarettes to get
through my first midterm cram
session. I began studying around
7 p.m. and finished up around 5
a.m. —— a complete wreck.

For the first hour of studying, I
was comfortably sitting at my
desk, reading, underlining, sip-
ping some coffee. But within the
next few hours, I slowly changed
into an alter ego —— apathetic,

other since time began. Nowa-
days, it's an exact science notjok—
ingly referred to as "better killing
through chemistry." Nangrahar
province in Afghanistan has had
its soil and water table infected
by the Soviets’ confirmed use of
"yellow rain” (tricothecene
mycotoxin). I marched through
there five months ago.
Civilized countries have long
condemned the use of chemicals
on humans. World War I saw

wide spread use of chemical and S

incendiary weapons by both
sides. One out of four American
casualties were caused by chem-
icals, and the Russians took hor-
rendous casualties, something we
both never forgot.

Following the carnage of
World War I (the war to end ’em
all), some effort was made by the
League of Nations to prevent
another use of chemical warfare.
The 1925 Geneva Protocol calls
for the prohibition of asphyxiat-
ing, poisonous, or other gases
and of bacteriological methods of
warfare. The United States never

» signed the Protocol after protests

from U.S. chemical-weapons
manufacturers and the chemical
branch of the military. ~

The 1925 Protocol has been

violated several times. When lta- .

Iy attacked Ethiopia in.193«5, it

used mustard gas-disseminated f

from aircraft, causing many
casualties. Japan allegedly used
chemical weapons against China
in:I938. In 1951, Korea, and later
China, alleged that the United

’ States was conducting bacterio-

logical warfare against them,
which was substantiated by two
independent investigating groups

done. I told myself I worked best
underfpressure and blocked the
test out of my mind. It worked for
me until midnight, the night be-
fore the exam. That's when my
nervous breakdown set in.

I was reading along, concen-
trating. on the material, when I
madethe drastic mistake of stop-
ping to check how much more I

needed to study. Icounted the '

page numbers, added up my

notes, and I felt increasingly"

nauseous. My notes seemed to be
stacked up to the ceiling, and I
felt like I was trying to move a
building. I reached for a cigarette,
took a long drag and tried to con-
tinue my concentration where I
left off in the text book. However,

itwas never the same.

All of a sudden, myireading
speed decreased about 50 per-
cent. My eyes wandered back
and forth from my book to my
reflection in my coffee mug. Five
minutes went by before I realized
I had been staring at thesame
sentence. The chair felt like .a

' rock, and I began to pace.

In 1965, Russia accused the
United States of chemical attacks
on the population of South Viet_-
nam, but the United States
described this as "tear gas.” Dur-
ing the civil war in Yemen in
1967, the United Arab Republic
(Egypt) allegedly used chlorine
and phosphorus devices on
royalist troops. The United Na-
tions took no action on this
matter. ' ‘

More recently, the Soviets have
used a variety of chemical
weapons in Afghanistan, includ-
ing Yellow Rain, which is one
step away from being biological
warfare. The Soviets-fhave sup:

. plied South Vietnam with Yellow
Rain and other chemicals for use
against the neighboring Cambo-
dians, and, a little closer to the
headlines, confirmations exist of
Iraqi use of Yellow Rain and
other chemicals against the Irani-
ans and the Kurds.

At first, no one took Iran's cry _.
of "gas!" seriously, chalking it up

to _paranoia or propaganda.
When the first surviving casual-
ties were hospitalized in Switzer-
land and otherineutral ‘countries,
the world had its evidence. Iraq
had definitely experimented with
a variety of chemicals in order to
deal with human waves of attack-
ing Iranians, some unarmed
children. ‘

Did Iraq ‘produce its own stock-
pile of poisonous gases? Israeli In-

some bizzare thoughts were

_about Snuggles, the’ fabric

drifting down in ‘to pile of laun-
dry cheerfully saying, "Hi, it's

i_ me, Snuggles!" played over and

over in my brain. I rubbed my
eyes, massaged my temples,
pulled my hair, but I couldn't get
Snuggles out of my head.

At this point, I was certain I-
would fail my exam and began to
shout out every piece of foul lan-
guage I could think of about my
professor. When Ifinished my

, recital of four letter words, I start-

ed thinking about taking a va-

. cation.’ V

Once my winter vacation was
organized, I felt a little more
relaxed and decided to resume
studying. When the last chapter
was done, I dragged myself to the
bathroom to brush my teeth be-
fore going to bed. Looking in the
mirror _was a disgusting ex-
perience. It reminded me of the
remake of The Fly. '

Regular Steelers return to defeat Bengals

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

When was the last time the
Pittsburgh Steelers resorted to
their passing attack (if you can
consistently call it that) in win-
ning a football game? Long time,
huh? Gotta go back to the days
when Bradshaw and Swann and
Stallworth made life miserable for
defensive_backfields.

But now make this entry into
The Morning Star of your
memory: The Pittsburgh Steelers,
behind the sharp, pregise passing
of Mark Malone (yes, that Mark
Malone), rallied to defeat the
schizophrenic but run—proof Cin-

cinnati Bengals 23-20 in the

.year’s first post—strike football

game.
Quarterback Mark Malone (18
of ' 30, 230 yards), who was
booed viciously by the crowd
even before taking his first snap

of the game, moved the club

from its own 32 to the Bengals 4,
setting up a 21-yard Gary Ander-
derson FG. The‘ key play in the
drive was 19-yard screen pass to
Ernestlackson on second-_and—ten
near midfield. ”They had been
stopping the run‘ pretty effective-
ly all day,” said Jackson. ”The
screen isn't something we run all
the time, and it hurt them.”
The ensuing Cincinnati drive

was smothered by an inspired
Steeler defense, and the ball
again belonged to Pittsburgh.

Then Malone caught fire. -

In perhaps his best drive ever,
Malone guided Pittsburgh straight
downfield for the tying touch-
down — a 12-yard dart to wide
receiver John Stallworth, who
was somehow accessible in a sea
of white—shirted Bengal
defenders. Malone completed
five of six passes on the drive, in-
cluding a 23 yarder to a shifty
Walter Abercrombie that moved
the Steelers down to Cincinnati's
13.

’’I think the key to that drive
was that we were passing a lot

more on first down than‘ before,”
said Malone. ” In the first half, we
threw a lot on second down, but
[the Bengals] like to put on a lot
of pressure on second, so we
made some changes.

”Heck, in the fourth quarter,
the fans were even getting behind
the offense a little bit, so that
made things even easier,” he
joked.

Stallworth’s TD reception gave
him 510 career catches, tying
him with Nat Moore at 15th on
the NFL’s all-time list. On the
next series, he snagged number
511, moving him into the 14th
po9ﬂon., ‘

And that next series was set up

by Cincinnati quarterback Boom—_
er Esiason’s boo-boo interception-
to Steeler linebacker Bryan Hin-
kle. ”V\/hat can I say,” Esifason
remarked. ”The turnovers killed

Pitt defense pushes   
Panthersto 10-6 
victory over Navy

By John Enright
Editor in Chief '

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Rep-
resentatives of the Peach and
Sun Bowls were on hand to
watch Pitt battle Navy at Navy-
Marine Corps Stadium Satur-
dayafternoon, but’ they must ‘.
have left feeling quite_ambi'va— A
lent about the Panthers.

Sure, Pitt-won, improving its
record to 5-2. But the Panther
offense-, which has become‘
nothing more than Craig
”|ronhead" Heyward and a‘
large cloud of dust, could
manage only 10 points against
the 1-6 Midshipmen, and that
was barely enough to give Pitt
the 10-6 win before a crowd
of 29,167.

To say the least, Pitt's victo-
ry over Navy (previous losers
to William & Mary and Le-
high) was hardly of the impres-
sive variety. —

”The thing I told our players
is a lot of [teams} today are go-
ing to get beat, upset or
whatever, so we found a way
to win. I don't care how it
looks. We didn't play very
well, but a lot of things hap-
pened to us,” said Panther
coach Mike Gottfried, whose

team must now prepare for
this weekend's showdown
with 7-0 Syracuse at Pitt
‘ Stadium. ,
In the early going, it ap-
peared Pitt, a 26-point favorite,
would have very little trouble
disposing the Midshipmen. _
Navy took the. opening. kick-‘A
off and was forced to punt, give. .-
inglthe Panthers the ball on

4 their own 33-yard line. Pitt ‘-
drove 67 yards in 16 plays for '_ .

the game's first score.-

Heyward, who carried 10 3-

times for 30 yards on the
drive, dove in from the one, "
giving Pitt the early lead.

Heyward finished the game '
with 37 carries for 140 yards
— his seventh consecutive
100-yard rushing game this

- season.

Navy came right back and
closed the gap to four points
7-3, with a 37-yard field goal

by Ted Fundoukos early in the _ ‘

second quarter. -

Pitt had two good scoring -
opportunities in the second
quarter but could only manage
three points.

Panthers’ special teams continue to shine

By Sam Tallarico

ANNAPOLIS, Md. —- Even
though Pitt raised its road record
to 3-0, the win wasn't the least bit-
impressive. Navy held the Pitt
offense to 10 points, as compared
to the 27 and 24 points scored by
William & Mary and Lehigh,
respectively.

0 Pitt's special teams have
been pulling their weight as of
late.'Two weeks ago, the special
teams never gave Heisman

much time to set himself up for
a good return.” , ._ —

Against Navy, Pitt held the

for Pitt returners, they were able
to place Pitt in good field position
most of the afternoon even
though Pitt didn't capitalize.

Senior Billy Owens returned
two kickoffs for 40 yards, and
junior Michael Hadley returned
one for 27 yards.

On punt returns, senior Teryl
Austin returned two punts for 43
yards, one of which was a
41-yarder. Senior Gary. Richard
returned one punt for 44 yards,
thanks in part to a reverse from
Austin. Richard was tackled at the

fourth down twice in the same
drive, both attempts being suc-
cessful. This is _a very risky move,

especially in a close game like.

this one, but Gottfried wasn't too
concerned about the risks.

”l’ve been doing it since Nor-
walk [Ohio] St. Paul [High-
School, Gottfried’s first coaching

Go ahead and finish it up,
Boomer. ”That last play was
designed to go out of bounds, to
stop the clock, but my main
receiver was covered. We figured
18 seconds was enough time to
get into a good field goal range,
but me scrambling around back
there took way too much time.
Those things just happen.”

And the Bengals never got that
last field goal opportunity, for the
final seconds ticked off before
kicker Jim Breech and company
could get in their appropriate

The Steelers needed a spark, a
swift kick in the gludius to get

As a result of winning their

volleyball team now has the lon-

gest current winning streak of any g

volleyball team in .the nation.
They have won their last 21 ‘con-
secutive matches and have a

”lt’s a streak to be very proud

‘of to be-sure. We are on track to

becoming the most_ successful

On Saturday, the Panthers had
some troubleiwith "Miami. Pitt
was losing two games to one, but
Jenelle Latagne, Denise Frawley

and Lisa Stewart led a spirited P

comeback to win the match three
games to two.

”That win was a season saver,”
said Collier. A loss would have

reverse handoff, giving Pitt a first—
and-goal at the Navy 8. ”Scott
[O’Brien, Pitt's special teams
coach] had seen [the opportuni-
ty] on the film, and he wanted to
try it out. He thought it was a
good time to try it out/’ said
Gottfried.

But three plays produced only
two yards, and Pitt settled for a
22-yard Jeff VanHorne field goal
with 7:50 left in the half.

Pitt's next possession started at
the Navy 39, courtesy of a
42-yard punt return by Austin.
The Panthers faced a fourth-and-
three play at the Navy 32, and it
appeared they would go for the
first down.

But, the penalty bug, which has
victimized Pitt all season, struck
again. The Panthers were called
for illegal procedure, and John
Rasp came in to punt. Neither
team amounted any serious scor-
ing threat the rest of the half.

The Midshipmen added a
48-yard Fundoukos field goal
with 9:21 left in the third quart-
er, closing out the game's
scoring.

But not the excitement.

Navy started a drive on its own
five with 10:01 left in the game
and drove all the way to Pitt's 25.
Faced with a fourth-and-four,

freshman quarterback Alton Griz- -

zard kept the ball but was
stopped short of the yardage mar-
ker by linebackerlerry Wall with
3:12 left.

”Overall, we're hurt, but that's
not an excuse. I think what Navy
did is they played a very fine foot-
ball game against us. They took
some things away. They really
made it a close game,” said
Gottfried.

Pitt's first— and second—string
fullbacks, freshmen Louis Riddick
and Prentiss Wright, both were
injured in the game, leaving Pitt
without a fullback.

V Gottfried said he almost had to
use Ronald Redmon, a freshman
from Miami, Fla., who has yet to

the sidelines and do pushups for
the amount of points after Navy
hasscored (similar to the Pitt mas-
cot). It was a sad sight to see
when, after Navy's second field
goal gave them six points, some
of the Middies stopped a little bit
short of that goal.

0 Remember Brian Davis, the
running back who was going to
help the Panther backfield be-
come one of thebest in Pitt his-
tory? Well, Davis was in
attendance at the game and was
in the locker room after the game.
He is presently attending Mont-
gomery Junior College in Rock-

ville, Md. It is reported he will -

meet with university officials to-
day about re—entering Pitt in the
winter term and possibly playing
football again for the Panthers.

Neither team was able to pose
another threat, and the game end-

Heyward was moved to full-
back for one play, and he fum-
bled for only the second time this
season at Navy's 43 in the third
quanen

”We have to get a third full-
back. We just have to get our in-
jured people back or make some
position switches in practice,”
said Gottfried, who isn't sure if
Riddick or Wright will be back
this week. ,

Adding to Pitt's offensive woes
was the play of quarterback Sal
Genilla, who completed only five
of 11 passes for 30 yards. In the
second half Genilla was zero for
four.

He also fumbled two snaps
from center, but Gottfried wasn't
complaining. ’’I thought Sal did
the things we asked him to do,
and we won the game. He made
some key completions for us.
Overall I was pleased."

”|t’s not the greatest thing in
the world, but we got the victo-
ry,” added Genilla. _

While the win improved Pitt's
road record to 3-0, it was the sec-
ond straight road game in which
the Panther offense has struggled.

The Panthers beat West Vir-

Soccer team loses-to St. John’

‘By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team (3-8-1
overall, 0-3 in the Big East) ex-
tended their losing streak to four
games by falling in overtime 2-1
to St. John's, Saturday afternoon.

”This was the same old story,”
said Pitt head coach Joe Lux-
bacher. "We play a good team

 

tough, only to come out on the
wrong side in the end. We just
can't seem to turn it around.”
. The first half started off very
slowly. Both defenses took im-
mediate control of the ball. It
never really made it down to the
goalie unless it was kicked out of
bounds. ~
”We were more aggressive
than we havebeen,” said Pitt's

Jon Ascher. ”We just didn't get
the breaks.”

Pitt now took control of the
ball. They again moved down the
field and again were turned back.

Then, with about 17 minutes to

go before halftime, St. John's .

moved down the field. Redman
Michael Tolkin took a shot from
about the 20-yard line that was
able to sqeeze through the hands

of Kapusta. St. John's led 1-0.

’’It seems that every one of our
errors comes back to haunt us,”
said Luxbacher. ”They [St. John's]
got that one bad goal, and the rest
of the game was a fight.”

”We played a much better
game in the second half,” said
Pitt's Kurt Weber. ”We forced the
issue better, but we can always
improve.”

The second 45 minutes started
in direct contrast to the first. It
was the Redmen who controlled
the ball, but the Pitt defense held
tough. _

Finally, with about 15 minutes
gone, the Panthers were able to
get on the board. Pitt's Mike Blatz
put a side kick right over the mid-
dle, and Dave Moss jumped up
to head the ball into the net.

With less than three minutes re-
maining in V regulation, Moss

again took the ball down into the
St. John's end. A couple of pass-
es later and Moss had the ball in
front. He took a measured shot
that was just about to go in, when
the St. John's goalie dove to his
right to stop it. '

This was the last real threat as
time ran out. The game moved
into overtime tied at one.

The first 10-minute overtime
was like a miniature replica of the
second half. Defenses controlled
the play, and time ran out with
the game still tied.

As the second overtime started,
it looked like the game was go-
ing to end the same way it start-
ed — tied.

But with less than four minutes
gone, St. John's came alive. They
took the ball down the field, and
Kevin Casey‘ put the ball past
