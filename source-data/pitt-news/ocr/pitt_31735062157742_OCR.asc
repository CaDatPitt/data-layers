Men is Cauncilfndswark 

 

The much talked-about major changes to the constitution
of Men’s Council were completed last Tuesday. The two most:
important changes are those affecting membership size and
eligibility requirements. _

The constitutional revision was begun last December by a
committee headed by A1 Capozzi. Since the committee report-
‘ed a month ago discussion and planning meetings of Men’s Coun-
cil have been held every Tuesday. ,

The revised membership clause, intended to result in ac‘ _
more compact and manageable men’s governing body, accord- ‘ 
ing to secretary --Bob Kaufman, is as follows: - ‘ ‘

“The’.schools represented in this Council» shallbe:
Business Administration, College, Engineering and<Mines, _,
Education, and Pharmacy. Men’s Council shall consist of
ﬁfteen members to be elected proportionally by the ‘above’ 
schools, each; school being entitled to at least one repre- -
senta.tive.” ' _ - 2 ' ‘ ‘ 1

Up to -ﬁve members will be elected internally, that is, from:
members of the previous year’s Council. These members are to ’be_‘1
chosen by Senior, members. I‘ A Q

The Pharmacy School has been included because of .the Uni- 
versity’s plans to move it to the campus proper as part of Pitt’s
long-range building program. _ ‘ ’_ " "

Eligibility. requirements have been ‘raised considerably.‘ The
quality , point requirement has been raised from the former 1.00
average to a. 1.2 average. The new activities requirements, ‘set
by Carl«'Angstrom, constitute another gréatichange in the con-
stitution. This point applying to candidates for Council reads
as follows: L , T. _

“He must have one major and one minor activity, or two major r
activities, or three minor activities, as listed by Men’s Council Ac- 1
tivities Committee.” . - ~ _ I

Council’s new activity scale system considers the ‘following
as major activities: being an officer in an honorary or a’ social
.fraternity, the YMCA, a departmental club (social or otherwise);
or a religious club; being a dance chairman, a member or «a ~
manager of a varsity sports squad, ‘amember of a. vocal or in-_W '
strumental musical organization,’ a member of _a student gov-1 "
erning body having .a. major position on a. publication, "or a}m'a-
jor part in the acting or "production of a dramatic presentation.‘ —

Thefollowing are considered as minor activities: being a. mem_-V ,f

awards to remain on the program.
These are‘: ODK, Mortar Board,

As to pre-election publicity, A_r- -
, ticle IV Section 5 reads: “The
names of each candidate for elec-
tion to Council shall be given to
the Pitt News for publication
within two weeks prior.to these
elections, giving the candidate’s_
activities and scholastic average.”

tions on April 20 in conjunction

take place simultaneously, as in
the past. ' -

Voting machines have been rul-._ _

changes. Instead, voting will be -
by hand ballots placed in ballot _v
boxes. Ballot boxes will be placed  
in the Commons Room, State Hall, V
the Pharmacy School, and Ells- .

As to amendments, Article _
‘VII states: “This constitution '
may be amended by three-

Military Ball
Tonight  

Tonight’s the night of the an-
nual Military Ball, which this year
is being held at West View Dance-
land. Blues and OD’s as well as
the brass with their pinks, greens-
and bars will be on hand to dance
to Tex Beneke’s music_. ‘

As at all Pitt formals, corsages
are taboo. The cadets of the ROTC
are requisted to wear their uni-
forms but this does not come as an
order. If they wish they may wear
regular evening dress. a

“The Ball is the ﬁrst open
formal dance that has been given
this year and the turnout has
been more than gratifying. It ‘
shows that the students want
name bands and formal dances,
and that they are willing to pay _
for them,” Dave Cleland, the

costs of the dance had been met,
thus insuring the ticket holders

‘ plenty of dancingroom.

COUNT us out!

At their last meeting student Congress passed a resolu-
tion putting their okay on a publicity committee to be made
up of nine men, one of whom would be the editor -of the
Pitt News.

During the debate and revision of this publicity committee

plan we privately started our objection to the inclusion of the
News editor on such a committee. We did it not once, but many
times. Eiiidently it meant nothing to Congress.
’ ‘ For the past year ormore publicity for dances and other
Student Congress events has been handled under a plan set
up jointly by Congress and the News. Under this plan publicity
chairmen for Congress affairs come to the News several weeks
in advance of theirevent and a schedule of stories is w.ork_ed
‘out. I A

The plan has worked t.o the -mutual satisfaction. of the‘

News and Congress—at -least no member of Congress, even in
the debate over the new committee, has stated any differently.
We have repeatedly told Congress ‘that we wish to continue
-dealing with publicitychairmen directly, not through a com-
mittee. ' a
Congress and the committee that recommended the new
publicity group says that the committee will not disrupt this
arrangement. They say that the committee will merely “ad-
vise” publicity chairman.-But “advice” can be as strong as a
command or as weak_ as a suggestion. There is nothing to pre-
vent the board from becoming avirtual dictator of what pub-
licity chairman can and cannot‘ give to the News. S
From our standpoint it is not desirable that the editor of
the News be a part of the committee. From the committee’s
standpoint it is not necessary that he be a member of it since
the advice he could give on publicity measures is negligible.
a All of these reasons and others dealing with the editor’s.
responsibility have been voicedato member's of Student Con-
gress and to members of the committee that drew up the pub-
licity report. None ofthe objections have ever been answered.
No on has questioned them and proved them wrong. ‘No one
has ever pointed out ‘how or where. the-new -system will be any
better than the present arrangement with the News.
' When the committee is formed in April the present editor
of the News does not intend to join it since no one has yet
shown that his presence is either necessary or desirable. Nor
_ doeshe intendto send a representative because, though he may
delegate authority, he cannot delegate responsibility.

You Can Learn
All About World

Right Here at Pitt

By PAT SEGER
The “Now Seven Days a Week”
newspaper has a man about town
by the name of Charlie Danver.

Last Wednesday Mr. Danver men-
tioned in his column that at a
Rotary get-together for district
colleges, two Pitt students from
Greece‘ met for the first time. P
‘ “Though both had been at Pitt
since last September, they had
never. met,” the Post-Gazette
columnist reports.

I had one after-thought when
I read that. Why do foreign stu-_
dents have to go off campus to
meet one another Apparently
University oﬂicials ‘realize the
irony of the situation, too, for
they sponsor a dinner for ocean-
hopping students each year. But
even a» dinner to acquaint our

. non-American students" 1 e a v e s

something to. be desired. Not only
should the travelers in the crowd

get to know one another,’ but .

American students, too, should-

'learn their names and ways of

thinking. a There, should be oppor-
tunities for “we and they” toameet
and ‘discuss matters of universal
concern. H .
Firsf'Hand information

I'm rather, sure of the positive
beneﬁts from such get-togethers
because I was one of ﬁve student-
hostesses to ‘foreign students at
their annual dinner in the -Faculty
Club last Monday evening.

There ‘was a gentleman from
India at our table. What he told
us about India has never been
printed in books, or colored and
recorded by globe-trotting report-
ers. Everyone at our table be-'
lieved what the native of India
had to say, for h_e spoke with a
tone of authority. Here was a
ﬁrst—hand report, from a mind of
one who knew.

Industrialization in India was
the gist of the young man’s words.
Since that discussion, I’m sure to
watch the goings on in India much
more closely. Things are happen-
ing there—but fast, even faster
than in the days when Ghandi
held the spotlight. '

' The other 64 students, in -at-‘
tendance at the dinner probably
had just as interesting a" tale to
tell. We rub elbows every day

with these ‘men and women, yet

never hear their stories. They go
unheard. Who knows how many
of them come here and return
home without pouring out the
things that will help us to better
understand the peoples of the
world? I wouldn’t venture a guess
at the number. A ~

Chance to Meet ‘and Learn

An attempt is being "made at
present on campus to reactivate
the Cosmopolitan Club, an organ-
ization to schedule meetings where
foreign and American students
could spend many hours exchang-
ing ideas. V

The ﬁrst meeting of the club is
scheduled,‘ for Monday night at
8:30, in the basement of the First
Baptist Church, located across
Fifth Avenue on the Belleﬁeld
side of the Cathedral. American
and foreign students are invited
to attend and exchange news and
views. A

If many students attend, the
time is not too distant when for-
eign students may meet eachother.
often, know each other by ﬁrst-
name, and be known by _Pi_ttites
as great storehouses of culture and
knowledge that can never be
found in books.

There have been four changes

Modern Bridge

 There has been a school of thought that used the openin »

notrump bid as a request for partner to name his ._beS.t.3'Sui
This is absolutely contrary to modern practice. A, suit “bi
over a notrump opening by part- ’
ner is made only with exceptional,
hands. It shows an unbalanced
hand (i.e., one that contains a
Void, singleton, or two doubletons).
With a weak unbalanced hand,
holding, for instance, a, six—card
club suit headed by the queen and
an outside queen, the proper re-
sponse to-a one notrump opening
is two clubs.

This warns partner that your
hand is not very good and will
play better at clubs than at no-
trump. The notrump bidder should
pass unless he has such a good
club ﬁt that he is sure that he can
make ﬁve or six tricks in that suit
and can stop the other suits long
enough to make a game at no-
trump. With a moderately strong

This shows eightpoints which ,added to the eighteen l
your hand and divided by three, promises to produce llll
tricks, three notrump, then, can be made. But the two four car
suits suggest that if partner has’
four of either major suit, four
hearts or spades can be made. In
rubber bridge this is not impor-
tant but the scoring in duplicate
is such that the extra twenty
points may mean the difference
between a very good score or a
very "poor one on the hand.

It is easy to investigate the pos-
sibility of playing at four of a
major without , going above the
three notrump level. After the
two notrump, response, -with the
hand shown above, the best bid
is three hearts. This tells’ partner

Thomas Jarret Reviews
23 Years As Official  

‘Campus Camerman

. I By BILL SCRIVO

Thomas M. Jarret, oiﬁcial University photogra-
pher, is a man who “shoots” what he goes after.

For instance, that beautiful color reproduction
of’ the. Cathedral of Learning you have all see on
the cover of the summer College bulletin was tak-
en by Mr. Jarret from the next to the top ﬂoor of
the University Club. —

‘-‘If I could“ have gotten of the roof, -I would
have taken it from there,” says Mr. Jarret.

This is typical of the short, ;pleasant,. pipe-
smoking man who has been taking pictures for
Pitt for 23 of his 55 years and who thinks nothing
of ‘going to the zoo to get a picture of a panther.
“From outside the bars,” "Mr. Jarret adds.

Mr. Jarret learned his trade from his father,
an East Liberty photographer for 50 years, who
specialized in taking ﬁne portraits of children. Lo-
gically, Mr. Jarret’s favorite lens subject is chil-
dren.

“I like it here,” Mr. Jarret says:
of Pitt, “In_ all my time here, I’ve
never "had 5 run—in with. anyone.”
He does all his own work, from
taking the pictures to developing
and printing them in 813 C1. His
duties include taking pictures for
“Pitt” magazine, publicity shots,
and making ofﬁcialphotos.

He even cleans his small office
and workshop. “It’s better this
way,” he explains, “I know where
everything _is.” 

The oﬁicial photographer is
married and has two sons and an
adopted daughter. Neither, of his
sons are photograpehrs. They are
“both in the telephone business,”
Mr. Jarret "says, without a trace
of regret in his voice. But _he loves

Club Plans
New Start

On Campus

An attempt will be made next
Monday evening to reorganize

‘the Cosmopolitan Club.

Thomas Wheel, a student from
London, England, feels that there
is a great deal to be gained by
bringing together foreign stu-
dents.

“Our main reason for trying to
reorganize the club is to foster
better understanding and rela-
students
and Americans at Pitt,” said Tom.

The ﬁrst meeting will be —held
in the basement of ‘the First Bap-
tist Church at the corner of Bay-
ard and Belleﬁeld at 8:30 p. m.

Tom said that‘- all students
would be welcome, foreign and
American. Foreign students

/Francisco White, Halim Akol, and

Selahattin Engez will be on hand
to assist in the organizing.

The Model. That Is

Sports Editor

The ﬁeld house is ﬁnished.

But don’t try to use it. It’s not a very strong structure.
One step “inside” would mangle the balsam wood beams and

tissue paper roof.

For the completed building is merely a model of the new
athletic structure to be erected on the bluff beside the Stadium

during the next year or so.

Walter Ridley, the dean of the
athletic ofﬁce staff, was given a

A plaster model of the Gaelic-
Romanesque design of the future
Irish room along with 12 scale
drawings have arrived from Ire-
land.

According to Mrs. Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, though the plaster
model has been received at the
‘University, the drawings are still
in “diplomatic pouch” in Wash-
ington.

The design of the Irish room
was first drawn up by A. A. Klim-
check, University architect, who
was inspired ‘by ‘he Gaelic—Ro-
manesque architecture of small
chapels or oratories along the

‘Irish Coast, built. by missionary

monks from Rome between '600
and 1200 A.D. i
The co—operating committee in
Dublin approved the design with
the‘ understanding ‘that certain
revisions of ornamental details for

The Irish government then got
a well known Irish sculptor to
make a plaster model of the
Gaelic - Romanesque ornamenta-

Senate Arranges Low Cost
Student Fares to Europe

Approximately 7,500 students will be able to go to Europe this
summer for as little as $250 for-the round trip.

The trips are made available
bi-partisan group of senators.

Commission troop ships will be
used to carry the students to Eur-
«ope. The movement of the stui
dents would‘ be integrated with
the transportation of displaced
persons. This would furnish

prompt transportation for another ,

5,400 displaced persons to the
United States.

Senator
speaking for the group of spon-
sors said, “The'sponsors of this
program recognized the education-

‘ al Value of travel and were alarm-

ed that the policy of encourage-
ment was to be frustrated.”
Senator’ Flanders was referring-
to the fact that many people were
blocked from going to Europe be-
causeof the extreme shortage of
transportation. _,
, The Program which the senators
will introduce requests the Pres-
ident to ‘provide accomodations at
reasonable rates for stu-
dents‘ and other-persons traveling
for educational or cultural pur-
poses.”
The low rate of the trip is pos-

\.

' sible because the ships will be

carrying full loads each way. No

v direct'cost to the government is

expected. -

It is planned that the ﬁrst sail-A

ing in the student program would
be on June 4 from New York to
