Race colors dating scene, dean says

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

More than two-thirds of the black population in
America are single.

“African—Americans are the only group where most

people aren’t married,” Dr. Larry E. Davis said Wednesday

, afternoon at a book signing for the latest edition of his book, ‘

“Black and Single: Meeting and Choosing a Partner Who’s
Right for You.”

In his book, Davis, who is the dean of Pitt’s School of
Social Work, applies psychological theories to dating with-
in the black community. His ﬁrst edition sold more than
50,000 copies nationwide. His new edition will be available
nationally and in the University Book Center.

During his quest to publish his first edition in the early

‘90s, Davis faced criticism. His ‘book was the ﬁrst to‘

explore dating from a purely racial perspective.

“Most people are unaware of the diﬁerences between
blacks and whites,” Davis said, referring to dating and rela-
tionship statistics.

Davis explained that black people face different issues ‘

than whites do when dating. Demographically, the black
community has a shortage of available men — incarcera-
tion’ and a lack of black men with steady jobs create odds
against black women ﬁnding good matches, he said.
“Even if all the black women wanted to get married, it
would not be possible,” Davis explained. There are only
eight black men for every 10 black women in America, and
if factors such as education and income level are taken into
account, the number drops to about ﬁveeblack men for 10

“A lot of black women feel that if they are educated,

there is a discrepancy [with] the
numbers of [educated] men,”
Solomon said '

This discrepancy presents a
unique dilemma within the black
dating community, where more than _
two—thirds of degrees. are given to
women, Davis said.

“I  [available men] are out A
there, but it’s hard to be in the right
place at the right time,“ said Bill
Gaston, a senior at Point Park
University who showed up for
Davis’s signing. ~

“Most people who are educated v 

aren’t into the clubs and the bars,”
Gaston added.

Davis’s book gives advice for
singles facing dating diﬂiculties.

Since black women tend to have
their children younger than other
women, Davis devotes an entire
chapter to dating with children.

He also explores intenacial dat-A I I I

ing. .
“White women have more
power because they have more
options,” Davis said.

He added, however, that black

but he willingly signed books on Wednesday.

Although Davis’s book may seem to revolve around

race, the core of the book focuses on
relationships. The book is about

selective activity,” Davis said.
' People take into account class,
race, ethnicity and religion when
looking for a partner, he said, adding"
that people don’t really like those
who are the opposite of themselves
but, raﬂier, those who complement
them. _

“J. Edgar Ashcroft,”
Bush infuriate Bond

Bond, page 1

He is no less passionate in his opposition
to the cunent war and the Bush administration.

“Their idea of equal rights is the
Confederate and American‘ ﬂags, side by
side,” Bond said. “They draw their support
from ﬂie Taliban wing of American politics.”

He turned his criticism to the USA

‘ PATRIOT Act as well, referring to Attorney

Gen. John Ashcroft as “J. Edgar Ashcroft,”
and remarking that “democracy is too often
lost in the pursuit of democracy.”

Reﬂecting upon racial progress in the
United States, Bond insisted that afﬁnrrative

action is still imperative to bridging achieve-

ment gaps between whites and blacks. _ ,

Bond believes that opponents of aﬁirma—
tive action really want a “color—free America,”
rather than a color—blind America.

“Most of our elite professions have long
been the exclusive reserve of white men,”
Bond said. He added that racial stigmas are
“virtually as alive today as they were m the
19th century.”

He assailed the Bush administration’s
positions on affirmative action, particularly the
adrninistration’s brief ﬁled in opposition to the
University of Michigan’s aﬂirmative action
program. Bond called Bush’s opposition
“ironic,” noting that Bush is said to be a bene-
ﬁciary of “legacies” in admission to Yale and
Harvard. -

Bond called Secretary of State Colin
Powell and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice “human shields on any crit-
icism on civil rights,” but he did applaud their
support of afﬁnnative action programs.

When questioned about changing ethnic
demographics and the growing population of
Hispanics in the United States, Bond wel-
comed them to the NAACP, saying that “col-
ored people come in all colors.”

Discussing the growing burden upon
younger people to support entitlements, he
said that the ratio of workers to retirees receiv-
ing Social Security would eventually drop
from 5:1 to 3:1, and added that the names of
those three people could easily be “Tamika,
Maria and Jose.”

Local food workers don’t need Vaccines

When given the choice between
overreaction and reason, an Allegheny
County Health Department committee

I chose reason, and decided not to

require Allegheny County food service
workers to get hepatitis A shots.

According to yesterday’s
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, this decision
comes after an investigation into last
year’s outbreak at the Chi—Chi’s
restaurant at Beaver Valley Mall — in
Beaver County, not Allegheny. The
outbreak was eventually linked to
green onions from Mexico, not
employee behavior.

Given that hepatitis A is a nation-
wide problem, considering that there
were outbreaks in Georgia, Tennessee
and in many western states, companies
should be worried about their employ-
ees. But requiring mass vaccination in
a county where there haven’t been out-
breaks is overreacting — particularly
when Chi-Chi’s has stopped using
green onions altogether.

Hepatitis A can be contracted by
eating contaminated food that has
either been handled by someone with
hepatitis A or someone whose hands
have been contaminated with the virus,

according to the Food and Drug ‘

Adrninistration’s Web site.

People are now aware of the dan-
ger hepatitis A poses — and should
continue to educate themselves of
food’s potential dangers.

The fact is, eating anything comes
with a certain amount of risk — there
are high mercury levels in fish; botu-
lism in canned goods; bovine spongi-
form encephalopathy in cows;
Salmonella and E. coli in undercooked
meat; and, released yesterday_ on
Reuters, higher arsenic levels in chick-
en than expected. It’s a wonder people

‘haven’t tried subsisting. on Styrofoam

and double-filtered water.

Keeping people informed is a bet-
ter method than requiring a select
group to get vaccines. That said, if
companies are concerned about hepati-
tis A, then they should provide vac-
cines gratis, thus gaining safer
employees and good press.

Hepatitis A is widespread in
Mexico and is often carried into-the
United States by people going back

and forth over the border, accordingto

a Health Department spokesman quot-
ed in the Post‘-Gazette. \

In fact, some doctors consider it to
be enough of a threat to call for vac-
cines in the New England Journal of
Medicine. Their report recommends
vaccines for high-risk groups,‘ includ-
ing people living in western states,
drug users and people living in coun-
ties with a high incidence of hepatitis
A — of which Allegheny County isn’t
one. So kudos to the committee for

picking the reasonable choice and not '

requiring unnecessary vaccinations.

A couple of days ago, I received
an e—mail titled, "“George Bush’s
resume.” Naturally, I assumed this
meant the President was shopping
around for better offers and wanted to
sign on as my personal assistant.

Actually, it was a long list of
dubious accomplishments, from a
1976 DUI arrest to a
prescient sell-off of
Harken Energy stock .
just before the compa-
ny — on whose board
of directors he served
—— nose-dived.

With the election looming, the tone is
more frantic, the need to “get out the
message” more dire.

Unfortunately, no one seems to
know what the message should be,
and the notion of ‘speaking up’ paints
the problem as one of volume rather
than coherence, as though
parroting the same lines
grows more persuasive
with an. increase in deci-
bels.

Some of the shrillness
is just exasperation.

Nothing seems to

trating. ' ‘

No matter how many
lists of cynical voter

divide you stand.
Some, like the men-

'tion of Bush’s cheerleading days at

Yale, are trivial no matter where you

Others, like the cuts in health-
care benefits for war veterans and
duty beneﬁts for active-duty troops,

activists and Democrats would like to
believe the botched weapons search
is a serious issue. America, seeming-
ly, thinks it’s a non—starter.

Speaking up is only the first part
of building a credible opposition to
Karl Rove and the Republicans (the
name of my new death metal band) in
November.

Most of the facts that Democrats
want to address are already on the
table. _

We’ve been watching the Iraq
war, the Valerie Plame probe and the
state of the economy. We know about
the corporate inﬂuence and the disre-

gard for the environment. T

The information is out there, and
while most people have already cho-
sen sides, that‘doesn’t mean it’s time
to start screaming to the choir while
complaining that no one else is listen-
ing.
The difficulty in taking on any
sitting president, especially this one,
is that the Presidency and America
are so often synonymous. There’s
still an aura there, and anyone whose
mind is made up can dismiss com-
plaints about the president as attacks
on America.

The Democrats need to tease

apart the two ideas — this president
and American ideals — and show that
they are not one and the same.

That means more than making
lists and speaking out. It goes beyond
advertising and brand management,’
into talking about ideas for the future
of the country. ’

Yes, .you’ve given -us the lists;
you’ve spoken up and out about how
bad Bush. is for America. Now tell us
why you’re better.

through creative dance expression.

The dancers and choreographers showcase
their talents in “Multiplicity” — the multi-genre
performance with lighting by resident lighting
designer Brant T. Murray. This show will feature
performances of modern, jazz and even ballet
dance — minus the tutu. - .

Multiplicity was created to present eclectic
works in different genres, danced and choreo-
graphed by Peter Boucher,
Shannon Hritz, Christina Jones and Lauren
Suﬂita, all of whom are classically trained. Yet
they are open to pushing their technical back-
grounds to find their individual dance talent.

BCB encourages breaking away from the
mold and creating movements that are special-
ized for the individual. That is why the concept
of contemporary ballet sprouted from the classi-
cal ballet arena —— each dancer is allowed to
have his or her own style. The choreographers
who will perform _have studied and worked in
collaboration with Maria Caruso, the artistic
director of BCB.

Caruso is the founder and school director of
BCB. She is a native of Pittsburgh and has her
studio and school located on Forbes Avenue in
Gene Kelly’s first studio. She received her
Bachelor of Fine’ Arts in performing arts and
dance at Florida State University at the -age of
19. She has studied and performed in Florida,
Georgia and New York, and now has developed
her own company with the mission to inspire and

’ enrich young and talented artists.

The institution functions as a nurturing envi-
ronment for high—quality dance education that
also encourages a community of artists to pursue
their passion and take their talents to a higher
level of learning. A

Jennifer Guy,‘

What Caruso would like to see from this per-
formance is taking dance to a higher level.
Through studio work, Caruso encourages stu-
dents to educate themselves in dance not only in

» a pre—collegiate setting, but in‘ a university insti-

tution where dance is the main focus" of educa-
tion. Dance, according to Caruso, should be a
lifelong professional career.
What is particularly unique
about BCB is that Caruso encour-
ages people of a Variety of body
types. It has been said and even
viewed by many audiences_ that
ballet and dance are targeted at
those with lean and petite body
types. Caruso not only showcases
different genres, but she also
makes it a point to encourage
people all shapes and" sizes to
dance. Her‘ mission ‘sprouts from
seeing dancers discouraged
because of their body type, which
led\ to a misguided conception of
dance and the art form, Dance
should focus onmovements, she
believes; no dancer should get
caught up in body image. _
Caruso’s experiences
inspired her to find success in a
professional career that would
allow dancers to eliminate the
body-image issue. Caruso
believes that the technique and
artistry of the art ' form is the
most important aspect, rather
than how well the body assimi-
lates itself into the ensemble.
With’ this in mind, BCB was
founded, and contemporary bal-
let was adopted as a style that

“Multiplicity” will be performed byvBCB at
the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater on Fri., Jan., 30,
Sat., Jan. 3] at 8p.m. and Sun., Feb., I at 2 p.m.
For tickets call (412) 521-6094.

The Story Of severalnew bands coming tothe Rex  

As January draws to a close,
we’ll start to see some life being
breathed into this cold city, in terms
of shows. The Story Of will pay a
visit to the Rex Theatre this
Saturday, along with The Lights
Ahead and School of Athens.

All the bands bring an indie feel
to the table, which should warm the
hearts of Pittsburghers. The indie

scene .has been stagnant; as emo ‘

becomes more of a sensation, some
good, old indie rock ingthe “veins
never-hurt.

The Story Of will show off ethe-
real indie textures when they headg,

.s.~,,
a_«~?‘

line the show this Saturday. The
five-piece from Ohio is led by
vocalist Christman Hersha,“ who
also plays keyboards and does “pro-
gramming.” You’ll hear a lot of
electronica textures on their debut
album,’ and perhaps even strings -
which might even be synthetically
transposed on the keyboard at the
show. -

Critics across the country have
been describing them as art rock
and dark dance music. Some songs
will have you thinking they’re the
infamously catchy and danceable

....,i_ndi_e rockers-A, The Faint.A;_.‘Q,ther¥“i

‘ rs. ‘

songs will convince you they forgot
the ‘80s are long over. Regardless,
this music is fun with a dark spin on
it.

The Lights Ahead are somewhat
reminiscent of Coldplay, combined
with the aesthetics of college rock.
The music is piano fronted, with a

fluttering lead vocal done by Jon

Zebraskey, and his partner in crime,
Josh Shapiro.

The Lights Ahead were original-
ly a two-piece hailing from ' the
Steel City, but have recently enlist-

, ,egl a full-time drummer. The show 
Ethis ‘we_e_kend\ will be the first time. ,

they play as a full band, rather than
an acoustic-only set. .

~ So not onlywill yougwonderful
folks see two bands you may have
never heard rock out, but you will
also get a- taste of School, of Athens.
Try to make it to this show to hear
some truly original music from the
tri-state area.

The Story Oﬁ The Lights Ahead and _

School ofAthens will be performing
this weekend, Sat., Jan. 3], at Rex
Theatre from 9 p.m. to closing.

Carolina looks to defeat the favored Patriots

   
 

For the past two weeks, the only thing
that I’ve been hearing and reading in the
hours of Super Bowl XXXVIII coverage
that I’ve seen has been variations of the old
cliche “defense wins championships.”
However, while I certainly believe that this
adage is true, the men on the other side of
the ball, the olfense, will ‘decide this year’s

‘ Super Bowl.

And it’s for that reason that the Carolina
Panthers will win Super Bowl XXXVl]1 to
secure their ﬁrst World Championship.

Now, before you go off and conclude
that I’ve spent too much time out in the cold
dodging snow banks, hear me out; ‘

In a game that will feature twoof the
NFL’s top ten defenses, each defense will

rely on its offense for ﬁeld position, points,

and, ultimately, the Vince Lombardi trophy.
During the playoffs, it’s an undeniable

fact that-the Panthers have played better *

offensively than the New England Patriots

despite playing against arguably better
defenses. In Carolina’s ﬁrst playoff game,

’ Deborah Gentile

against the Dallas Cowboys, nmning back .

Stephen Davis ran for 104 yards, and quar-
terback Jake Delhomme threw for 273
yards against a defense that allowed 89 total
rushing yards and nearly 250 total yards per
game during the regular season, both league
bests. Delhomme’s quarterback rating dur-
ing the playoffs is higher than 100, while
he’s completing more than 60 percent of his
passes.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, on the
other hand, has struggled during the play-
offs to the tune of a rating below 75 percent
and a completion percentage of just above
one-half. Against two average defenses
Brady struggled as New England relied on
its own defense for victory. ’

For the Panthers to win, Delhomme
does not have to play a perfect game. The
Patriots can count on seeing a heavy dose of
srnash—mouth football in the form of the
two-headed monster that is Davis and team-
mate DeShaun Foster. Against the
Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC
Championship, Davis and Foster combined
for 136 yards on 33 carries. While " New
England has allowed only one 100—yard
rushing game this season, that game came
against a Denver Broncos team that was
very similar to Carolina. The Broncos, like
Carolina, featured a strong nmning game
led by Clinton Portis and complemented by
Quentin Grifﬁth and Mike Anderson.

Meanwhile, against the Eagles,

Delhomme completed only nine passes for
101 yards, including a touchdown strike to
Muhsin Muhammad. Should Delhomme
perform _similarly against New England, the
Panthers would have a hard time not leaving
Houston victorious.

Conversely, for the Patriots to win,
Brady must play a virtually perfect game.
Against Carolina’s defensive line, consid-

-eredbymanytobethebestintheleague,

New England will have a hard time nmning
for more than 40 yards, meaning the pres-
sure will be. on Brady to move the Pats
down the ﬁeld At this point, one of the most
underrated secondary defenses in the league
awaits Brady — the same defense that inter-
cepted the St Louis Rams’ Marc Bulger and
the Eagles’ Donovan McNabb three times
apiece on their own home ﬁelds. Led by

rookie Ricky Manning, ﬂue Panthers’ top-

ten pass defense stymied the NFC’s leading
pass-oﬁense and shut down one of the
NFL’s most talented players. When
Carolina’s aggressive pass-rush is not forc-

’ ing Brady to make quick decisions, the

Panthers will be forcing him to make near-
perfect passes under heavy pressure. The
Panthers defense will prove to be the best
defense Brady has faced all year, and head
coach John Fox will have Brady more con-
fused than Peyton Manning in the AFC

. Championship game.

Lastly, one cannot forget the intangi-
bles. Two years ago, an underdog Patriots

team went to the Super Bowl in a dome after ’

defeating the top seed of their conference on
the road in Pemrsylvania. In that game, a
ﬁrst—year starting quarterback, aided by one
the NFL’s top defenses, beat a heavy
favorite and previous Super Bowl
Champion to claim its_ ﬁanchise’s ﬁrst
championship.

Unfortunately for the Patriots, history

‘will repeat itself when the underdog

Panthers will play under a closed roof at the
Super Bowl after defeating the top seed of
its conference on the road in Pennsylvania.
And once  a ﬁrst-year starting quarter-
back, on the play of one of the league’s

strongest defenses, will narrowly defeat.

another heavy favorite and former Super
Bowl Champion to claim the Carolina
Panthers’ ﬁrst Super Bowl title.

In a defensive battle, Tom Brady
becomes the third star quarterback to be
intercepted three times in a game this post-
season by Carolina, and kicker John Kasay
kicks a ﬁeld goal as time expires. The Cats
beat the Pats, 23-20.

David Shearouse is a staff writer for The
Pitt News. Being from New Hampsh1'ne, he
actually hopes the Pats destroy the Panthers
and thinks‘ that  Tom Brady does win his
second Super Bowl in three years, he should
be considered a better quarterback than
Peyton Manning. He can be reached at
