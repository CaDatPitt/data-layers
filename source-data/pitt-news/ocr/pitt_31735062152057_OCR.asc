Ex-Socialist To Speak
At Community Forum

On Monday Evening

 

A Socialist who turned Republican
will speak on “The Republican Point
of View” at the Monday meeting of
the Community Forum in Schenley
high school.

John Spargo has been brought to
the Community Forum, according to
W. W. Mendenhall, a member of the
Forum executive committee, in an-
swer to criticism that the forum rep-
sented liberal but not conservative
thought. Mr. Mendenhall, who is also
executive secretary of the University
YMCA, stated that Mr. Spargo as a
former Socialist, can speak for both
liberal and conservative thought.

Mr, Spargo, an Englishman, came
to the United States early in this
century as an advocate of socialism.
With Samuel Gompers, he founded
the American Alliance for Labor and
Democracy. He was a member of
the National Executive Committee of
the Socialist party for several years.

In 1927 Mr. Spargo announced his
resignation from the Socialist party.
Last election he supported Herbert
Hoover for the presidency.

University Debaters’

First Meet Scheduled

The debating season will be off to
an early start as the University de-
baters travel to Washington, Penn-
sylvania, to meet a team from Wash-
ington and Jefferson College, Thurs-
day evening, October 27.

The match has recently been sched-
uled, according to Arthur Kelly, C37,
manager of the debate squad, at the
request of the W&J group. The sub-
ject will be, “Resolved, That Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt, in the Light of Past
Accomplishments and Present Condi-
tions, Should Be Reelected as Presi-
dent of the United States.”

Anyone interested in trying out for
the debate is asked to report to Room
220, Alumni Hall.

Block To Swing Into Action
At Tomorrow’s Game

When the crowd moves into the
Stadium tomorrow, it will perhaps be
startled at the huge block of bright
blue which ﬂashes before its eye.
For it will be the ﬁrst crowd to see
the Pitt demonstrations block in ac-
tion.

According to Louis Bearer, E37,
student chairman of the block, no
complicated maneuvers will be at-
tempted tomorrow. His committee
has in preparation three possible for-
mations which were practiced yester-
day afternoon.

The ﬁrst of these is a gold “P” on
a background of blue. Plans today
call for a “rolling P,” in addition,
giving the effect of “unpeeling” a
cover from over the letter. Also
planned is a stunt to be done with red
cards on the blue background. A
huge red and blue “D” will ﬂash
across the Stadium between halves.

 

Second Prize Canvas Lacks
Brilliancy, Enthusiasm,
Declares Professor

 

By Ruth Horowitz

Commenting on the Carnegie In-
ternational Exhibit, Walter R. Hovey,
acting head of the department of ﬁne
arts says, “The same people exhibit
every year. The show suffers fr-om a
lack of sufﬁcient representation of
newer artists.” Mr. Hovey found
the general tone of the exhibit this
year somewhat conservative, the
small number of countries repre-
sented regrettable, but presenting an
unusually high average.

“The ﬁrst prize this year, Leon
Kroll’s ‘The R-oad From the Cove,’ is
one which will probably please the
public a great deal more than the
awar-ds usually do,” Mr. Hovey con-
tinued, in commenting on the exhibit,
which opened yesterday. “Al-most
everyone will at least like the picture.
The committee last year showed good
judgment in purchasing Kroll’s
Morning On the Cove’ for the Insti-
tute’s_ permanent collection."

Follows Old Tradition

Of Pierre Bonnard, winner of the
second prize award, Mr. Hovey re-
marked: “Bonnard is an old man,
«brought up in a tradition now out-
W1 -n. In trying to keep with the mod-
ern movement, using a technique
derivative from Matisse, he has done
very competent work, but it lacks
the brilliancy and enthusiasm of ﬁrst
discovery.”

For, according to all reports, fra-

pledges expected in practically every
corner of the campus.

Meanwhile, the Men's Fraternity
Committee, student-faculty group
which supervises fraternities, met for
the ﬁrst time Wednesday afternoon.
A petition by a new prospective fra-
ternity group, to be called Sigma Phi

for Alpha Phi Delta, social fraternity,
to restablish itself on campus was
withheld until the fraternity has sat-

Inquiry To Hear

Labor Organizer

Philip Murray Will Discuss
Steel Labor Problems

Labor organization problems, es-
pecially those in the steel industry,
will be discussed by Philip Liurray,
chairman of the Steel Workers’ Or-
ganizing Committee, before Monday’s
Inquiry Forum, in Room 107, Alumni.

Mr. Murray will discuss the strug-
gle between the industrial and craft
unionists, in which he is playing a
large part. As head of the SWOC,
a division of the Committee for In-
dustrial Organization, he is aiding
John L. Lewis in the campaign to
unionize the steel and several other
mass production industries.

The SWOC is working to organize
the steel workers into a vertical union
as opposed to the traditional Ameri-
can Federation of Labor craft or
horizontal type union. As a result
of the unionization campaign, the
ranks of organized labor have been
split into two parts. Ml‘. Murray is
International vice-president of the

United Mine Workers of America.

Public Can Now View 1936 Prize Winner

“THE ROAD FROM THE COVE”
LEON KROLL, New York art-
ist, which has been awarded the
first prize of $1,000 in Carnegie Insti-
tute’s 1936 Exhibition of Contempo-

BY

rary Paintings. Mr. Kroll,_a native

American artist, has contributed to
previous Internationals, and his entry
last year, “Morning On The Cape,”
was "purchased by Carnegie Institute
[for its permanent collection.

The exhibit should, Mr. Hovey said,
strive to be comprehensive and yet
at the same time stress "one particu-
lar artistic movement each; year.

“They might, for example,” said
Mr. Hovey, “emphasize in one year’s
exhibit the surrealist movement rep-
resented by Pierre Roy, "with much
more verve and imagination, by Sal-

vador Dali.” ‘

Besides Dali’s ‘Essai Surrealiste,’
Mr. Hovey found particularly inter-
esting Paul Nash’s ‘Rotary Composi-
tion,’ Hopper’s ‘Mrs. Scott’s House,’
and Spe~icher’s ‘Susan.’ ‘Segonzac,’
he said, “was as excellent as usual,
and Carroll’s ‘Meeting at Twilight’
had something of the same appealing
qual-ity as his ‘Sleeping’ last year.”

Lawrence’_s ‘Mr. _and Mrs. L. Stuy-
vesant and Children,’ Mr. Hovey

thought, showed excellent craftsman-
ship, although painted in the artist’s
usual conservative style. The fact
that Lawrence was on the committee

of judges which made the awards
probably inﬂuenced the conservative
ﬁrst prize choice, Mr. Hovey believes.

‘In Somerset, Pennsylvania,’ by
Alexander Kostellow, of Carnegie
Tech’s department of ﬁne arts, was
also very good, Mr. Hovey thought.
“Kostellow’s work has improved a
great deal,” Mr. Hovey pointed out.
“His colors are much more delicate
and subtle.”

American Section Outstanding

The American section of the ex-
hibit was especially outstanding, Mr.
H-ovey continued. “The English sec-
tion also is better than it has been
for a long time. The exhibit as a
whole is quite superior to the national
academy exhibits in America and
England. The American section
stands up surprisingly well, in spite
of the refusal of several artists to
exhibit on account of the recent dis-
putes about the payment of rental
fees.

“The policy of the museum, how-
ever,” Mr. Hovey insisted, “should
be to get the best paintings possible
with the funds available, regardless
of the rights or wrongs involved in
the rental "fees demands.”

' very important tea-party.

In fact, of the two previous parties
the Panthers and Dukes have had,
this one looms as the high-light of
the series. Back in ’32, the Dukes
received their ﬁrst invitation to come
0Ve1‘ and play with the big, bad Pan-
thers and they went home with 33
less cookies than the Panthers. Two
years ago the social lions met again
and this time the Dukes allowed the
Sutherland boys only seven more
cookies than the Bluﬁites had them-
SelVes, which was quite surprising,
considering how hungry Panthers us-
ually are.

It was last season, however, that
the Dukes really came out and as-
serted their rights to a cut of the
elty title. They beat Tech, 7-0, then
the Tartans surprised and came over
to the Stadium to _hold Pitt to a score-
less tie, all of which _made the Dukes
Very happy. Immediately they were
named city champions. And as such,
the Panthers aim to entertain them
tomorrow.

Cheering Block Adds Color

As an added attraction to an al-
ready attractive game will be the ﬁrst
appearance of the new Pitt cheering
block. . Wearing gold and blue rever-
Slble Jackets, 800 students will go
through their ﬁrst maneuvers between
the halves of tomorrow’s game when
they form the letters “D” and “P.”

The organized cheering section, a
novel idea borrowed from the West
coast where it is one of the biggest
lfhlngs Of a football game, will make
its debut into the Eastern circles to-
morrow at the Stadium.

Over on the Bluff the Dukes boast

The Last Rush

NE MORE DAY and it will end. The week has been bustling,

perhaps even a bit hectic at times, but as it nears a close frater-
nity men and rushees alike must admit it was “a lot of fun.” For
many freshmen, it is one of the highspots of the freshman year.
When they are Seniors they, too, perhaps will look back to this
time when they were supreme.

True, it may be termed a rather questionable show of suprem-
eacy. But the fact remains that the ﬁrst-year men, for the major-
ity, were escorted quite royally through rounds of lunches, din-
ners, smokers, dances, and the many other events on the various
rushing programs. They were escorted by a pretty ﬁne cross-sec-
tion of the sophomore, junior, and senior classes.

It will take a short time to catch the breath that escaped so
quickly during the early part of the week. To the men who are
able to “pledge” a fraternity that condition may continue for sev-
eral weeks. However, most ‘everyone will remember this swift,
shifting period of action as one of goodwill, laughter, suspense, and
“great fun.” To some, it will be a “turning point.”

City Football Champions?

ONCE MORE, a city title ﬁght comes up for “Jock” Suther-
land’s Pitt Panthers. However, this one is a bit different.
Where the Tech Tartans played the supporting role now steps the
ambitious Dukes to make the thing a three-cornered scrap. Du-
quesne defends the city title, but has yet to take the measure of
Pitt. However, last year’s title came to them by virtue of de-
feating Tech by one touchdown, followed by the Skibo—Panther
stalemate shortly thereafter. Tomorrow we hope the title is stowed
away in the Stadium for the Pitt-Tech game in November.

Mr. Theodore A. Siedle, assistant

tion, was one of the speakers yester-

Switch Subjects

New Topics To Be Discussed
At Tuesday’s Meeting

Instead of using the electric utili-
ties question for extension debating,
the Women’s Debating Association
will use the question selected by Pi
Kappa Delta, national forensic fra-
ternity, for intercollegiate debating
this year. The question is, “Resolved,
That Congress Should Have the Power
to Fix Maximum Hours and Minimum
Wages.”

The association will hold a supper
meeting on Tuesday at 5:30 o’clock
at Heinz House.

A mo-del impromptu debate will be
given on the question Tuesday night.
Marcella Leyton, C37, and Ruth Hor-
owitz, C37, will uphold the aﬁirma-
tive. Jeannette Schwartz, C38, and
Phyllis Tabor, C37, will argue the
negative.

Towel Bests Flames
In Chemistry Lab Fire

Fire broke out in the organic
chemistry laboratory last we-ek while
Milton Hansburg, M38, was heating
a test-tube of frozen benzene.

When the tube came in contact
with the ﬁre the benzene burst into
ﬂames spreading onto the table-top
and his notebook. In his attempts to
put out the fire, he beat the ﬂames
with his hands. Anna Margaret Pat-
ton, C39, smothered the ﬂames with
her towel when his efforts proved
futile.

Mr. Hansburg was given first aid
for his hands, then rushed to the Falk
Clinic.

Students of all types of art and
architecture may ﬁnd books of inter-
est in the volumes recently received
in the Library of the Fine Arts De-
partment.

For English students there is a two-
volume series of “William Morris,
Artist, Writer and Socialist.” The
ﬁrst volume, written by May Morris,
tells of the art of William Morris
and his ability as a writer. The sec-
ond volume tells of Morris as a So-
cialist, with an introduction by
George Bernard Shaw entitled “Mor-
ris As I Knew Him.”

Another book is “Hellenistic Arch-
itecture,” by Theodore Fyfe. Mr.
Fyfe hopes this book may point to
the more comprehensive study that
the subject deserves.

Freshman Runners
Star In Novice Meet

 

F rosh Kristel, Ohl, Chatham Take Firsts In Two Events;
‘ McKee, Bradenbaugh Win Longer Dash Runs
As First Day Of Tourney Opens

 

Championships, eight of them, were handed out Wednesday
up around the Stadium cinder path as the ﬁrst half of the two-

day all-University Novice Track

and Field Meet ran into the tape

with eight footraces.

Almost as numerous as the cham-
pionships were the individual stars.
The three freshman Franks, Kristel,
Ohl, and Chatham, distinguished
‘themselves is the same manner. That
manner was simply the winning of
two ﬁrst place ribbons each.

Frank Ohl won two of the big dash
events. In the 100-y-ard dash, after
winning his heat, he captured the
ﬁnal heat with a time of 10.4. His
second victory came in the 440-yard
dash, in which he coasted in by a sub-
stantial margin. .

Frank Chatham showed his spikes
to the distance ﬁeld. After stepping
ahead in the mile run with a time
that was cl-i-cked oil’ at 5:14, he
stepped over into the two-mile com-
petition. In this event he pace-d a slow
ﬁeld by about 20 yards. Another good
race in this event was run off by Joe
Kristufek. Kristufek ﬁnished strong-
ly to cop the second positi-on._ _

Franklin Kristel spent his time in
placing in three events. The hurdles,
which is his specialty, brought two
ﬁrst places. They were victories in
the 120-yar-d low hurdles and the
120—yard high hurdles. A second in
the 100-yar-d dash ear-ned another
victory for the third Frank.

- Bijadenbaugh Wins .

On-e of the meet’—s highlights was in
the 220-yar-d dash. Red Bradenbaugh,
one of the few contestants in the
meet who didn’t have an opportunity
to get in top condition for the meet,
was far ahead of the ﬁeld in the 220-
yard dash. The spectacled runner
gave a good account of himself in
his appearance, and can be classed
among the ﬁnds of the novice meet.

McKee, in the 880-yard dash, was
the other ﬁrst place winner. Field
events, for which Coach Olson had
the collaboration of Charley Gong-
loﬂ’, were completed late yesterday
afternoon.

Cub Football
Team Plays
Tech Plebes

Milligan Men Open Season
At 10 O’clock Tomorrow
On Carnegie Field

Coach Mike Milligan’s Little Pan-
thers are all set for their football
season opener with the Tartan Plebes
tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock in
the Tech Bowl. Although a starting
line-up was uncertain until recently,
the Cubs are ready to go to work on
their rivals from across the hollow.

Last year a twenty-yard ﬁeld goal
by Jack Lee in the closing minutes
of the ﬁrst half decided the annual
tilt between the Cubs and Tech
plebes, sending the Pittites down to
defeat, 3-O. Both teams have com-
pleted a month of training and are
in the top of condition for the
fracas.

Many scholastic stars stud the ros-
ter of Milligan’s squad. Slated to
start at the signal barking position
is Kish, from North Towanda, New
York. Johnny Dickinson, a former
Peabody gridder, is a standout for the
right terminal post. Dick Cassiano,
starting at left half, is a ﬁne, hard-
running back.

Milligan’s Second Year

Tomorrow’s game will start the
second season the frosh have been
coached by Mike Milligan. Last year
Milligan’s men, with a couple of boys
under the names of Goldberg, Dad-dio,
Stebbins and Lezouski, went through
ﬁve games, winning three, losing two.

W-ith no way to determine how
good or how bad the 1936 frosh will
turn out during the season, tomor-
row’s game is one of the most impor-
tant games of the year for the fresh-
man footballers. A bad start last
season, which had the Cubs drop-
ping their ﬁrst two games, spoiled a
mighty promising season.

Panthers, Dukes

 

(Continued from Page 1)
gathering more strength and power as
they went along. So going into to-
morrow’s game with a great collection

of backs, a big, heavy line, and_a
city title to hold on to, the Dukes W111
give their best.

Sutherland’s powerful squad, On
the other hand, has traveled through
the Ohio Wesleyan, West Virginia,
and Ohio State lines for three straight
impressive victories. Last week’s af-
fair at Columbus only helped to make
the Pitt-Duquesne battle tomorrow
the more important, with the Dukes
offered a grand chance to step into
the middle of the national spotlight
if they take the Panthers.

Clipper Smith, busy with last
minute tapering off processes. has
gone on record as desiring a dry, fast
ﬁeld on which to send his team
against the Panthers. Smith’s lads
are big and fast and go much better
on a dry ﬁeld. In agreement, “Jock”
Sutherland has mentioned that he,
too, would like a dry ﬁeld.

Duquesne’s line will average 180
pounds and will be led by Mike Bas-
rak, captain and center, one of the
best linemen around these parts. Mike
comes in about 210 pounds, which is
a lot of pounds. Starting at left
tackle will be a 200-pound sophomore,
Bill Critchﬁeld. In the Rice game Bill
stood out like an old shoe among
rice at a wedding.

In the backﬁeldare a mob of stars.
Foremost is Boyd Brumbaugh, a half-
back that can really go places with
the ball. Brumbaugh will probably
not start the game but he will cer-
tainly see plenty of action later on.

Battle Tomorrow

‘At quarter is Frank Zoppetti, and at
half is Veto Vairo, both smart, fast,
and hard running backs.

The Dukes’ greatest threat in their
type of play is long passes, the kind
that scored against Rice a few weeks
ago. If the Panthers play any sort
of the ball they did againstthe Buck-
eyes last Saturday, the Duke passers
are in for a long, hard afternoon.

This week at the Sutherland camp
has been spent mostly upon offensive
work, especially the double wing-back
formations. Only one change has oc-
curred in the Panther lineup, that be-
ing Al Lezouski at right guard in
place of Dante Dalle Tezze. Lezou-
ski earned the position with his hard
play against Ohio State.

One other change may occur, this
change at fullback. Frank Patrick
has been the starter for the last two
games but Bill Stapulis may replace
him in the opening lineup tomorrow.
Right now it appears to be a toss-up
as to just who will start.

The remainder of the lineup will
stay the same. Bill Daddio and Frank
Souchak will be at the ends, Tony
Matisi and Ave Daniell at the tackles,
Biff Glassford and Lezouski at the
guards, and Heinie Adams at center.
In the backﬁeld Johnny Michelosen is
slated to start at quarter, Bobby La-
Rue and Marshall Goldberg to team
at the halves, and either Patrick or
Stapulis at fullback.

Neither “Jock” Sutherland nor the
players are taking the Duquesne
game as an easy one, for it appears to
be one of the toughest‘ tests on the
Panther schedule. And that is how
the Panthers will feel going into the
game.

Novice Cagemen

Start On Monday

 

With a promised demonstration of
basketball varying from the ludicrous
to the superlative, Dr. Carlson’s nov-

ice basketball tourney will get under
way on the Stadium Gym ﬂoor Mon-
day at 2:30 o’clock. Late entrants
will ﬁnd an entry blank elsewhere on
this page which should be ﬁlled out
and ﬁled today either in the Stadium
oﬁ"ice or in the oﬁice of Dr. Carlson
in the Falk Clinic.

The tourney is scheduled to run on
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Fri-
day, with games beginning each of
these days at 2:30 o'clock, and con-
tinuing at hourly intervals. This does
not mean that entrants are to cut
classes in order to play in the tour-
ney, and they are advised to do all
basketball playing during free hours.

Every male student who enjoys
playing the cage game is urged to
enter in the frolic and is promised
a good time. Dr. Carlson is not too
optimistic about the chances of ﬁnd-
inghidden among the entrants a gem
who might make a valuable addition
to future Panther basketball teams,
although such men as Zehfuss, Ar-
turas and Kowalis were uncovered in
former editions of the tournament.

Aren’t you “ex-tra proud” that you
go to Pitt after that swell showing
we made at Columbus on Saturday?
Well, you just show Goldberg and
Stebbins that the girl spectators can
be as smart to look at as the game
is exciting to watch.

Rugged smartness is what you
want when you “bounce” up and
down in your cheering section. When
your ﬁngers and nerves are tingling,
let your feet be extra warm and com-
fortable in a pair of Nisley’s crepe-
soled, buck oxfords. They originated
on the coast, so they must be smart
and practical! You may have your
choice of green, brown, grey, and
bl-ue (to match your little blue hat)!
in either one of two styles———the monk
strap which costs $4.45 and the three
eyelet t-ie costing $3.95. Besides -be-
ing sturdy shoes, they’re awfully
practical as they can be worn in-
stead of clumsy rubbers in wet
weather. The front seam gives the
shoe a slenderizing effect, to say
nothing of the metal-edged eyelets.
Honestly, they’re an “awfully swell
buy” in addition to being THE new-
est in campus footwear. Remember,
the ﬁrst store in the city to carry
them is Nisley’s, located at 333 Fifth
Avenue, downtown.

Adrian, located at 505 Sm-ithﬁeld
Street, again comes through with a
knockout of a “Date Dress.” It’s
really known as a Scotch and Soda
dress, but who at P-itt drinks Scotch?
Soda? Maybe! Anyhow, the dress
comes in either Coronation blue or
black with non-tarnishable metallic
threads running through it. It has a
Swing skirt and buttons down the
back.‘ The shirrcd wing-like sleeves
do wonders for the most non-angelic
looking specimen of our weaker sex.
Red and blue velvet bands the high
neckline and comes to a bow of
leaves in front. Did I hear you gasp?

If not you will when you see this
dress. It’s priced at $14.95, and
while _Vou’1'e looking, there are oth-

ers priced from $10.95 and up,

What do you lose more than any-
thing else? If you're a typical girl
the answer should be handkerchiefs.
The Trousseau Shop, located at 4010
Fifth Avenue, in the Schenley Apart-
ments, has an unusually excellent se-
lection of hand-made linen hankies
at -only three for a dollar. If you
are pretty well stocked up in hankies
from last Christmas, a sure bet, that
you don’t have, is a perfume ring.
The oblong ring, in all colors, is made
of a non-tarnishabl-e metal with an
opening in back of the stone into
which you put a drop of your favor-
ite perfume. The price of this
unique ring is ﬁve dollars, and wheth-
er you use Guerlain’s or Caron’s,
you’ll be sure to love it!

The Wardrobe, located at 190 N.
Craig Street, is featuring a typically
collegiate sheer wool dress at $12.95.
This two-piece dress, which comes in
Coronation blue, has white detach-
able collar aand cuffs plus small
pockets, and is punctuated all the
way down the front with small but-
tons. Since blue can be worn with

either black or brown accessories,
the skirt may be worn as a separate
skirt with either blouses or sweaters.
Even if you d-on’t need it for school,
you will need a dress of this type for
afternoon gatherings in the winter—

so there!

If you didn't write a note to your
Columbus chapter thanking them for
their hospitality on Saturday, you
really should. Undoubtedly the Ry-
tex -Sketchies (informals to you)
would serve the purpose so very ef-
ficiently. These clever little up-and-
down note sheets are deckled on one
side, bordered in blue, re-d, or green
on the other side, and have your name
or monogram at the top fold. One
hundred of these note sheets and one
hundred envelopes would cost you
only one hundred cents. It’s an Oc-
tober special, so take time off to
place your order at the Ann M. Galla-
gher Gift Shop at 1823 Murray Ave-
nue.
