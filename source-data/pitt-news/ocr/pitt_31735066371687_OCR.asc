Visitor to Africa speaks
on horrors seen there

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

Every day in Africa, you can be
absolutely certain that someone will
die of hunger. The land and the
mountains are totally devoid of
trees.

Yesterday at the Red Cross build-
ing in downtown Pittsburgh, the
chairman of the Women’s Commit-
tee of the Italian Red Cross, Maria
Pia Fanfani, gave a presentation on
the hunger—stricken continent.

A major part of the presentation

consisted of a slide show depicting
parts of the tragedy. The slides were
taken in the nation of Djibouti,
where Fanfani led the distribution of
supplies. Fanfani said she went
along so that she could personally
oversee the distribution. ln a letter
distributed to all in attendance, she
said she felt her presence was neces-
sary because she didn’t want to see
the supplies “accidentally end up
consigned to a local warehouse or
fall into the wrong hands.”

She spoke in heavily accented
English, turning often to a translator
beside the podium. She wanted to

convey what she saw in the most

accurate terms. Often the audience
understood the word she was
attempting to say by her expressions
and gestures. When they did, she
would smile and attempt the word.

When the people of Djibouti saw
her and the trucks that followed,
they smiled and began walking in
that direction. Fanfani said she was

struck by the way the people waited

patiently for their turns. In her let-
ter, she wrote of the faces: “In their
eyes one could see the limitless
patience brought about by centuries
of submission ofa cruel fate, a quiet
acceptance of the tests of pain and

Nicaraguan

struggle

seen first-hand

By Kelly Caruso
The Pitt News

“We are making an enemy out of
a country that we do not need an
enemy of "

- Michael Snyder

Since l98l, 8,000 deaths have
occurred in the strife—torn nation of
Nicaragua. Nearly 5,000 of those
deaths were a result of U.S.-
supported Contra raids and
ambushes, according to Michael
Snyder, a Ph.D. candidate of Pitt's
English department.

Snyder lived in the city of Esteli,
100 miles north of Managua. He
stayed with a family for eight weeks
and he lived a life close to that of a
middle—class' Nicaraguan.

The lifestyle is primitive com-
pared to the way Americans live,
Snyder explained. Many goods,
such as toothpaste, lightbulbs and
soap, are difficult to acquire in Nica-
ragua. Firewood is expensive and
very sparse. Aspirin and other medi-
cines, such as antibiotics, are in
short supply.

Ammunition, though, is not in
short supply, Snyder noted. Nicara-
guans are issued weapons at local
defense centers to defend themselves
against frequent Contra raids. Com-

munities defend themselves with
automatic rifles and have nightly
patrols.

According to Snyder, the Contras
show no mercy toward teachers,
health officials, religious leaders or
children. Just before Snyder arrived
in Esteli, the child of a community
leader was kidnapped by Contras; a
day later the child's body was found
mutilated in a nearby cemetary.

On Oct. 29, at a San Gregorio
resettlement community near the
town of El Jicarc, Contras report-
edly murdered six children between
the ages of live and ll in a dawn
raid.

At a school near Mataguapo,
close to Chaquitillo, Snyder learned
how to use an automatic riﬂe since
there was a constant threat of Con-
tra attack, he said. “Children as
young as l3 years old are taught how
to defend themselves with automatic
weapons,” Snyder acknowledged.

Nicaragua is struggling for survi-
val, he explained. It has a Marxist-
oriented government, which Reagan
called “totalitarian.” Snyder said
that Nicaragua is not strong enough,
nor does it have the finances to pose
a threat to the United States.

Economically, Nicaragua sur-
vives only on coffee exports. Since
many of the Nicaraguans left their

 Wilds named to

university post

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News A

Dr. John M. Wilds has been
appointed Pitt's director of human
resources. The appointment was
announced last Friday by Dr. John
Yeager, vice president for manage-
ment and budget.

Wilds will replace Gus Reineckc,
who retired at the end ofAugust. He
will be responsible for all aspects of
human resources at Pitt, including
employment, staff development and
benefits.

The university hired an independ-
ent firm to search for someone to
replace Reinecke. Approximately
I50 applicants were found. These

H applicants were then screened by an

in—house interviewing committee.
Wilds was informed before Christ-
mas that he had the position.

“This gentlemen has all the cre-
dentials you would need," Yeager
said.

A long-time resident of Pitts-
burgh, Wilds progressed through
several positions in his 20-year asso-
ciation with Jones and Laughlin
Steel Corp. He started there as an
employee interviewer, moved on to
labor relations and eventually
became supervisor of the training
division. ln l973, Wilds was named
manager of employee development
for J and L and became manager of
corporate human resources plan-
ning in l980. After this, he accepted
the position of vice president for
human resources at Warner Cable
Corp.

Wilds received his undergraduate,
master’s and doctoral degrees from
the University of Pittsburgh. He is a
board member of the Pittsburgh
Personnel Association and the Pitts-
burgh Regional Engineering
Program.

“We are delighted that Dr. Wilds
has accepted the position,” said
Yeager. “We feel that it is an added
bonus that he is an alumnus of the
University of Pittsburgh."

jobs harvesting coffee to join the
military, volunteers were needed to
harvest the coffee. Snyder added
that the volunteers were on a truck
when they were ambushed and then
blown up by Contra fighters.

According to Snyder, the Contras
are headed and controlled by the
CIA. The Contras have sophisti-
cated gear to allow them to sneak
into the homes of the unsuspecting
and brutally murder them. They
always travel at night and they never
build campﬁres, Snyder explained.
They have the latest man-made uni-
forms which have special features,

such as hidden inﬂatable pockets.
The Contra fighters travel in
bands of 20 men, so tracking them
down is almost impossible, Snyder
said. However, the morale of the
_men is very low because many are
coerced into joining the Contras and
are told that their -families would be
killed it they didn't join. ‘Many

academic year 1985-86 to finish his
latest book, “Cathedral and City in
Medieval Florence: the Archiologi-
cal History of a Thousand Years.”

Toker characterizes the book as a
tying together of facts and artifacts
gathered over the last 400 years. “I'll
. make a book of it by perceiving it
"better than others in the past,” he
said.

Only one systematic excavation
has been done in Florence. It was
run by Toker from 1969-74, when he
excavated the cathederal beneath
what is now the Cathederal St.
Maria del Fiore. Toker claims that
this dig “provided the missing fac-
tor” in studies of the city of
Florence.

“The unrest that is occurring in
Nicaragua is not a civil war as much
as it is foreign aggression,” said
Snyder. The Sandinistas want to
provide the people of Nicaragua
withjobs, better health facilities and
a stronger economy; the United
States, Snyder claimed, does not
want them to survive at all.
Although the Sandinista govern-
ment is a Marxist-oriented govern-
ment, it is more concerned with its
people than with communist ideals.
The Nicaraguan people have very
strong feelings and respect for their
government. “For the first time, they
have an opportunity to improve
their lives," Snyder explained. Cam-
pesinos (men who for the first time
in their lives own land) are growing
crops. The standard of living has
gone up and the literacy‘ rate has

increased. Nicaragua is ‘ now the _

awarded the Porter Prize of the Col-
lege A-rt Association, I980, and a
National Endowment for the
Humanities Fellowship,« both in
1979. Toker’s present fellowship

-differs from his previous grant in

that it affords him more freedom to
do individual work without as strict
accountability. He plans to work at
Princeton or the National Gallery
with occasional trips to Florence
although, he said, that most of his
research gathering was complete.

Toker has authorized three books
prior to “Cathederal and City;” his
third, “Pittsburgh: The City/The
Buildings/The Neighborhoods,” is
the first complete architectural and
urban history of the city. The Penn-
sylvania State University Press will
publish it in October I985. “Cath-
edral and City” will be published as
two volumes, in both English and
Italian in 1987. The first volume will
aim at the general historical
audience and maybe released in a
paperback edition. The second will
be a documentation of the facts pre-
sented and the basic of Toker’s inter
pretations and conclusions.

According to Snyder, the U.S.
and the CIA recently mined the
main port in Nicaragua. The port of
Corinto is where 80 percent of the
nation’s imports and exports pass.
Nicaragua responded by filing suit
in the World Court, saying, “The
U.S. was trying to bring down the
government of a sovereign nation."

The United States did not respond
because it would not recognize the
authority of the Nicaraguan govern-

, ment. This is another indication of
the attitude of the Reagan adminis-
tration, he claimed.

According to Snyder, there are
four Americans working for the
Nicaraguan government. “The N ica-
raguan government is an economic
and political experiment struggling

‘ for survival because of the_po.:licy

America has toward it._,"f he said,

Labor, Ethics and Eggtoss

The Denominational Ministry Strategy has given
local Catholic churches an eight-day ultimatum:
Either arrange a meeting between Governor Thorn-
burgh, Pennsylvania’s two senators, U.S. Steel Cor-
poration Chairman David Roderick and local union
leaders (the DMS), or be subject to skunk oil bomb-
ings and uni-directional egg tosses. The churches
have refused, and as yet violent threats have
remained nothing more than uncarried-out threats.
The threats, however, have become louder, and
Father Leo Vanyo of St Paul’s Roman Catholic

‘Cathedral said that he believes the DMS may soon
begin to turn those threats into action.

Given the high tension of the situation, it is difﬁ-

cult to believe that it will soon be resolved. Given the ‘

tactics of the DMS, it is difficult to believe that the
situation will ever be resolved unless their tactics
change. No one is likely to think of a group of angry
egg chuckers as serious people who are anxious and
willing to find a practical and practicable solution to
a real and solvable problem. Certainly, the gover-
nor, two senators and the chairman of U.S. Steel
don’t, for they have only addressed the DMS issue (if
it can be called an issue without fear of contradic-
tion) lightly. '

Also, it is well outside the realm of the likely that
threatening to make the local cathedral smell nox-
ious shall lead to Catholic support for the DMS
cause. The DMS, however, does not seek to win
others over to its cause. It seeks to force prominent
persons and institutions to pay enough attention to
it to allow for steady media coverage. There is little
evidence to suggest that the DMS has a concern for
Pittsburgh labor at heart.

Some of DMS’ leading spokespeople are’ union
bosses. Betty Fischer is a steward for Teamsters
Local 538. Raymond Baker is the secretary treasurer
of the same union. Ron Weisen and Mike Bonn are

presidents of. their local unions. If Pittsburgh’s steel '

industry goes, as it has, the local unions, and there-
fore un_ion bosses, will lose their power.

Given these things, and the necessary contradic-
tion between DMS’ espoused religious convictions
and its overt behavior, it is unreasonable to believe
that it can, or wishes to, do anything good for Pitts-

Letters to the Editor

if Special

Defects

Once again your papers knee-jerk
reactions and liberal standards
make their appearance in your opin-
ion pages (“Special Defects,” Jan.
l6). Obviously, you agree with Sena-
tor Kennedy when he ridicules the
Strategic Defense Initiative as “Star
Wars”; you do not recognize the
senator’s ridicule as a sign of his lack
of understanding. You continue by
joining those who call SDI “a foolish
idea conceived by an old man too
much enamored of modern technol-
ogy.” Do you believe it is possible to
be too disenchanted with modern
technology? And who are “most
members of the scientific commun-
ity” who do not like the idea? You
forget that scientists are no more
knowledgeable than laypersons
when speaking of things outside of
their fields; most scientists are not
military strategists, and a scientist's
opinion about the arms race is not a
scientific fact. If you are referring to
anti-S DI resolutions from the

From Where I Stand/ Dirk

American Association for the
Advancement of Science or the
Union of Concerned Scientists,
remember one need not be a scientist
to join either of these organizations
— l have received, through third-
class mail, several invitations tojoin
both. Also, it’s funny that you don’t
mind a scientist being “held in dim
regard by [his] colleagues” when he
happens to agree with you; why does
being in a minority detract from the
expertise of scientists who disagree
with you? When discussing other
controversial technologies, such as
nuclear power, the media presents
many so-called “experts.”
whom are as qualified to discuss the
merits of a particular technology as
its supporters, and many of these
“experts” are not even scientists at
all: The anti-nuclear “experts” who

also do not like SDI include an.

actress, a pediatrician and a lawyer.
(Read Dr. Bernard L. Cohen‘s
“Before It's Too Late: A Scientist’s
Case FOR Nuclear Energy" and see
what the real experts think of their
work — and why.)

As for the merits ofSDI, I will not
confuse you by introducing facts
since your minds are made up. If
your readers wish to check out the

none of

other side ofthe story, they may pur-
chase General David O. Graham’s

.“The High Frontier,” which comes

in a low—priced paperback edition
that even poor, starving college stu-
dents can afford.

lt’s a sad comment on liberalism
when a conservative in his seventies
has an ideal more optimistic, more
futuristic and more original than
anything young liberal have to offer.
Perhaps the “special defects" are
between your ears.

King Bowl Weekend

A three-day weekend is a many-
splendored thing. The weekend past
gave us all the opportunity to sit
back, relax and take in a little of the
great American tradition. Some
may have gone off for a weekend on
the slopes, an equally traditional
venture. The Superbowl was on, the
president was in and the beer ﬂowed
freely. Noble, traditional, American
ideas. ‘

Through the benevolence of our
wonderful, considerate government,

the three-day weekend has become a ‘

tradition of itsown. This is unfortu-
nate, because some very big names
in our country’s history are getting a
stinging slap in the face. The tradi-
tion of the holiday in America has
been lost in the holiday traditions.
This year may be the beginning of
the Martin Luther King/Superbowl
weekend. Just as Thanksgiving now

A has it’s afternoon games and Christ-

mas has its holiday bowl games, the
celebration of Martin Luther King
Day may be well on its way to disap-
pearing into inauguration and
Superbowl weekend.

Back in I954, America had other
traditions. Especially in places like
Montgomery, Ala. Blacks tradition-
ally sat in the back ofthe bus, ate in

separate restaurants, used separate
restrooms. All these things were
steeped in tradition. Most thought
they would never change.

A woman named Rosa Parks
tipped the scales of justice and
stepped out of tradition when she
took up the courage to fight for her
right to sit on a bus. A white woman
boarded a bus that was filled, so the
driver ordered Parks to give up her
seat so that the white woman could
sit down. That day, Park's feet were
tired and she was in no mood to
stand. She was arrested for refusing
to move.

This event sparked a protesi
against injustice in American
society. The movement was led by
Martin Luther King Jr., and it was
to carry him into American history
books.

His greatest obstacle was tradi-
tion. The white man could not
understand what the protest was
about; things had always been this
way. Some white people did com-
mend his nonviolent movement,
anonymously. You could feel the
change in the country, but it was
cutting away at American tradition

— and that couldn't be good. Hencg,

any congratulations had to be anon-

ymous and therefore rather shallow.
low. The blacks that King worked
with were often impatient with non-
violence. He was tested at every
move and he remained steadfast in
his beliefs. The Constitution states
that all men are created equal, but
tradition dictated otherwise. King
set about to change tradition.

At one point in the busing protest,
King stated, “I want young men and
young women who are not alive
today but who will come into this
world with new privileges and
opportunities, I want them to know
and see that these new privileges and
opportunities did not come without
somebody suffering and sacrificing
for them.”

Given the events of I954-I968, I
hope that at some time this weekend

doubt it. Perhaps today or tomor-

Arms and Arms Control

(Editor’s Note: This is the second
part of a three-part column that
shall continue throughout this week.
Part one appeared in Monday’s
edition.)

Part one examined the United
States‘ and the Soviet Union’s mutu-
al but failed search for stability in
their strategic nuclear relationship.
It was shown that two methods have
been pursued — one diplomatic, the
other militaristic — with meager
results.

The problems created by satellites
in space illustrate the differences in
these two approaches. The diplomat
argues that these important instru-
ments of maintaining the peace
allow both sides to track each other's
activities and must be protected. He

satellite weapons, which are capable
of destroying satellites.

The military strategist argues that
neither side could possibly prevail in
a battle without their satellites, upon
which they are both highly depend-
ent for field positioning, communi-
cations, etc. As such, anti-satellite
weapons should be developed, not
only to prevail if war were actually
to occur but also to deter one's
opponent from initiating global war
in the first place.

_  third approach may lead to sta-
bility by merging the best aspects of
both approaches. The United States
and the Soviet Union could mutu-
ally and symmetrically embark upon
a path of developing a defensive ca-
pability to actually protect them-
selves from incoming nuclear

has any significant ballistic missile
defense. It has been considered anti-
thetical to stability. Presumably, if
one side possessed such a defense, it
may in a time of crisis be confident
enough that it could strike at its
opponent first and defend itself
against the opponent’s ragged retali-
ation. But a ballistic missile defense
may just work.

The main stimulus to the arms
race and the reason why arms con-
trol has failed are not that one side
seeks superiority over the other.
Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. most
likely recognize that, however desir-
able superiority may be, it is not
attainable in the nuclear age.

Rather, the main reason why sta-
bility has been so elusive is that both
.P0.wers_ perceive the other as

ti‘?

continued from page four

attempting to attain superiority.
Therefore, they both have sought
safety in numbers of warheads. The
logic seems to be that one can buy
safety by investing in nuclear weap-
ons. It ‘may not make for thewmost
stable and controlled situation, but
who is going to mess with a super-
power having 10,000 weapons?

This is why bilateral defense may
work. If a superpower is intent on
attaining superiority, then it may
pursue unilateral defenses as a
means of gaining an advantage.
Even if the intent is not to actually
attain superiority, the defensive
deployment will be perceived that
way by the opponent, who will build
up his offenses to overwhelm the
defense. This is the logical, fairly
cheap and easy response, and it will
effectively mitigate the defensive
advantage.

However, if each superpower is,
as they claim, concerned with safety
and stability, a bilateral defensive
effort may be the key to slowing
down the arms race. Simply put, the
unstable safety obtained by exorbi-
tant numbers of offensive weapons
can be replaced and made better by
fewer warheads and a partially effec-
tive defensive system. (Note that no
defense has ever been perfect and
never will be. The defense should
therefore not be judged by this
standard.)

Question: Why don’t the super-
powers simply reduce their offensive
stockpiles, without the expense and
bother of defensive deployments?
Answer: That would require trust
and on a scale unforeseen in human
history. With fewer warheads, the
value of each remaining warhead
largely increases. With a defensive
system, the value of each remaining
warhead is reduced.

A negotiated bilateral defensive
deployment is not an idealistic hope,
itself based on trust. It is a pragmatic
means for the superpowers to reduce
their arsenals. Working on a bilat-
eral basis, the superpowers can
insure that neither will unilaterally

r increase its offenses to overcome the

other’s defenses and thus gain a uni-
lateral advantage.

Such a deployment would open
the way to offensive arms control.
Each side can feel safe with the fewer
nuclear weapons because they are
compensated by the defensive
deployment. As they negotiate and
deploy better defenses, they can
safely reduce their arsenals still
further.

The bottom line is this: the deve-
lopment of a ballistic missile defense
would require overcoming numer-
ous technical problems of two types.
Some are intrinsic to the system ——
i.e., actually building a system that
would work. These will most cer-

tainly be overcome in the
laboratories.
The other type of problem,

though, is external to the system -
i.e., the cheap and easily developed
and deployed countermeasures,
available to both the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R., which can easily reduce
the utility of the defensive system.
These problems require political
solutions in the form of bilateral
cooperation. Without such coopera-
tion, the system will ultimately fail
and instability will accrue. With
bilateral cooperation in manner
herein described, a safer, stable
world may actually be attainable.

This Bud's For You / Niccol Donnelly

Now that Reagan is our president
for a second term, I would like to
look back at this past election race.
In this race for the championship -
the championship being the presi-
dential seat in the Oval Office —
both teams made a mockery of the
importance of thejob. This is not to
say that either team was unqualified
for the job, only that they made it
appear very trivial. The numerous

accounts of mudslinging, requests
and denials of apologies, and humil-
iating experiences were comically
reported by the press. Now that the
election is over, we can see it for
what it was: a game. So, I take you
now to the winding-down ofthis his-
toric event.

To recap: On an evening of great
success for Walter Mondale, he
defeated an ex-party animal (Gary

DMS: A Lot of “Crock”/ Bryan Lee

A comic strip recently appeared in
The Pittsburgh Press funny pages
that was especially relevant to the
stand-off at the Trinity Lutheran
Church in Clairton and the tactics of
the Denominational Ministry Stra-
tegy and the Network to Save the
Mon/Ohio Valley.

The comic strip is called “Crock,”
and the characters in it are part of a
farcical foreign legion outpost in the
desert. In this particular strip, two
legionnaires happen onto
horseshoe-shaped tracks in the sand.

“You’re our top tracker, Gar-
wood,” says one legionnaire to the
other, as he points to the tracks.

' “What made these tracks?”

Garwood replies, “A purple
ostrich wearing horseshoes made in
Taiwan.”

“Incredible!”

“I know,” says Garwood. “In the
past they’ve been made in
Pittsburgh."

It’s an old gag, but this particular
strip is quite useful to illustrate the
View that the DMS-Mon/Ohio Net-
work position is as groundless as the
shifting desert dunes.

No one told these men when they
were hired at the mill that they were
guaranteed a job for life. Instead of
finding a constructive solution to
their plight, they run about like
spoiled adolescents, throwing stink
bombs at affluent churchgoers and
blaming Mellon Bank‘s investment
policies for their economic distress.
Instead, they should blame their
own union.

Granted, there was a time when
unions were needed and quite useful,
but perhaps they were too success-
ful. Working from a position of
strength when American industry
led the world, unions lobbied for
safety in a dangerous workplace and
a better wage for union workers.
Through strikes and confronta-
tional labor tactics, unions brought
the steelworker from having to work
70 hours per week, just to feed his
family, into a firm place in middle-
class America.

But in the last 30 years, as strikes
forced wages and benefits higher
and higher, productivity declined.
At the same time, more modem for-
eign mills came into being to com-
pete with American steel. Faced
with rising costs and sagging pro-
ductivity, American steel found it

could not compete.

This is a cycle to be seen time and
again in American industry. Some
50 years ago, New England textile
workers found themselves out of
work as the textile mills moved
south in search of less expensive, less
organized labor. Today those south-
ern textile mills are finding the going
extremely tough as they compete
with less expensive Asian textiles.
An Asian worker will work for far
less than his American counterpart.

For another example, letus return
to the comics, or to be more specific,
the animated cartoon. There was a
time when many of the major ﬁlm
studios in this country maintained a
staff of artists to produce cartoons
and animated shorts. Walt Disney
Studios, the best of them all, pro-
duced full-length animatedfilms —
masterpieces such as “Pinnochio,”
“Snow White” and “Fantasia.”
Warner Brothers and MGM car-
toons were a Saturday morning treat
for generations of children. Today
that is all changed, and just one
glance at the Saturday morning car-
toons is enough to see the difference.

The first strike for higher wages
by animation artists occurred at the
Disney Studios during the making of
“Pinnochio.” The artists were terri-
bly underpaid. But what was already
an expensive process became even
more so. The industry barely exists
in America anymore. Those Satur-
day morning cartoons,using cheaper
animation process, are made in
Taiwan.

All this is not to make light of the
situation in the Mon valley. The area
is extremely hard hit with the shut-
down of the mills, and fewjobs are
to be found. More and more, Pitts-
burgh looks like a part of Appala-
chia, which it is.

But the bottom line is profit. As
long as there exist foreign workers
who will provide the same or better
productivity at much less cost, more
and more American workers will
find their jobs exported overseas."

The DMS and the Mon/Ohio
Network may kick and scream and
hold their breath until they are blue
in the face, but their jobs will not
return. Perhaps their efforts would
be better expended looking for a
purple ostrich wearing horseshoes
made in Taiwan.

Hart) and Jesse Jackson, not to be
confused with the famous singer
Michael Jackson (who, it is said,
might have had as good a chance), to
gain the unanimous nomination of
the Democratic party.

In what Time magazine called a
“historic choice," he chose Geral-
dine Ferraro as his running mate —
the first female vice presidential
candidate. The Reagan team took
an early lead when Ferraro fumbled
in releasing her tax returns to the
press. This led to a Reagan-Bush
touchdown. Reagan seemed to be an
effective quarterback despite his
age. He then threw an interception
— the first debate. This debate gave
Mondale a touchdown to tie things
up. Reagan made some great passes
in the second quarter, vowing not to
raise taxes, which led to an addi-
tional field goal.

The halftime show consisted of
cartoons ‘of Geraldine Ferraro
standing beside tombstones with the
caption “Gerry's Kids,” and ads of
Reagan and do-it-yourself abortions
with pictures of coathangers. Other
slogans came up, such as “Fritz and
Titz,” and stories of Reagan being
the devil circulated because of his
connection with Jerry Falwell and
his name having six letters. So the
press left us with a great halftime
show.

When play resumed, relief quar-
terbacks were sent in by both teams
(Bush, Ferraro). This debate proved
to favor neither candidate but
brought up some memorable plays.
Bush treated Ferraro like a helpless
woman, and Ferraro reintroduced
the abortion controversy that high-
lighted the halftime productions.
Each scoring a touchdown, the
result proved that Bush had more
experience at the office and within
the government but Ferraro S had
more experience being a woman.
This last point was
because it was a factor in many of
the fans‘ reactions. .

Problems arose on the Mondale-
Ferraro team when she tried to take
on their first—string quarterback,
Reagan, on the issue of abortion.

Reagan had the church behind him
while Ferraro’s own religion was

denouncing her.
In the final quarter, Mondale

made some last attempts to discredit
Reagan with the second debate and
his TV ads. But he was the underdog
and was grasping at straws with his
awkward plays on Star Wars and
Reagan’s age. But Reagan will play
injured, as he has shown us he can
through the attempt on his life, the
Grenada crisis and his non-attack-
oriented ads. Reagan played on,
confident that if he tired Bush could
take over; some Americans would
likethat. Mondale was tiring, his
relief becoming more like a set of
ankle weights than an inspirational
lift. The game was lost for Mondale
when he attacked a man who was
almost a grandfather ﬁgure to many
people. The end was drawing near.

As the last few seconds ticked off,
stark reality set in on the Mondale
bench. Losing was no longer an
issue; making a good showing was.
A mere six states became too much
for Mondale to ask for. With Mon-
dale’s winning only one state, this
turned out to be a Superbowl no one
would forget.

The Mondale-Ferraro team lost
to Reagan-Bush. The victory was
bittersweet. To hear Mondale’s con-

cession speech made even the Rea- \.

gan supporter sad. Americans don’t
like to see runaway victories; they
want to see a close game. It doesn’t
matter who won or lost, just that the
Mondale
won’t run again, Ferraro gave up a
promising re-election to the Senate
and two families faced a tragedy in
this loss. The question of whether
Ferraro was an asset or a liability is
no longer important. They lost —- it
was the end.

As I watched the inaugural gala, I
knew that Jesse Jackson was‘ pro-
testing its expense. The only thing
missing from this election was a
Budweiser commercial, to all those
who gave it their best shot but just
weren’t good enough...Mondale-
Ferraro, this Bud’s for you.

(UPI) — With bitter cold weather
gripping much of the nation, the
National Safety Council has some
tips on how to survive frigid
temperatures.

Layers are best, they trap air and
insulate. Wear thermal underwear,
cotton or wool slacks and shirt, wool
sweaters, cotton or wool stockings
or knee socks or bib overalls. All of
this should be covered by an outer
layer that’s waterproof and
windproof.

For the feet, wear two pair of
socks. A light layer and a thick layer
reduce friction. Leave room so that
you can wiggle your toes after your
boots are laced up. Otherwise, circu-
lation can’t be normal. Wear water-
proof boots with good traction.
Wiggle toes and march in place to
keep circulation moving while wait-
ing for the bus, trolley or train.

For the hands, wear light gloves
topped by mittens if you need
dexterity.

Keep your head covered. Twenty
percent or more of body heat
escapes through the top of the head.
A wool hat that pulls over the ears
and forehead is ideal. In extreme

cold, wear a facemask with holes for
eyes and mouth.

The greatest danger is during
extremes of temperature. Frostbite
can occur in only five minutes.
National Safety Council safety
director Todd Turiff said “hypother-
mia and frostbite sneak up. Frost-
bite shows first as a slight ﬂushing,
then grey-yellow with white
splotches. That means tissue is
beginning to freeze.”

When driving, the greatest danger
is not being prepared for being
stranded, even when the trip is short.
Motorists must carry extra blankets,
coats and other clothing; anything
to wrap up in ifthe car breaks down,
stalls, or is blocked by a snowdrift.

The safety council cautions not to
drink alcohol to warm up. Alcohol
increases the loss of heat indoors
and out. Instead, drink soup, broth
or some other hot beverage without
alcohol or caffeine in it. Extremes of
caffeine also cause heat loss.

WASHINGTON (UPI) —- When
bad weather threw a monkey wrench

into the plans for Monday's inaugu-
ral events, officials had to make
changes in the number of people
who’d see President Reagan take his
oath in the Capitol rotunda, rather
than on the steps outside.

Faced with only a little room in)

the rotunda, the guest list had to be
chopped down from 140,000 people
to only 1,000. A spokesman for the
chairman of the inaugural commit-
tee said members of Congress were
invited but they couldn’t bring their
wives.

The rapid change in inaugural
plans caused problems for the TV
networks, who spent weeks planning
to set up cameras and equipment for
an outdoor parade.

When "CBS anchorman Dan
Rather talked from the east wing of
the National Gallery overlooking
the Capitol, he wound up apologiz-
ing because the window fogged over,
obstructing the spectacular view.

The window was defrosted during
a commercial.

Commission for a $325 million rate
increase.

Bell officials said 75 percent ofthe
increase will be sought in higher resi-
dential charges. The proposed
request also asks for $17 million
reduction in the cost oflong distance
calls.

Under the request, monthly rates
for unlimited service in Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh would increase from
$12.28 to $19.65.

Bell's budget and standard rates
would also increase by varying
amounts, depending on wherethe
customers live in the state. The

increase was needed because of
government mandated changes in
operations, reduced earnings and
increased costs.

The prepared request also asks for
a $l7 million reduction in costs for
toll calls and would allow Bell to put

p.m. instead of the current ll p.m.

Bell also is seeking PUC permis-
sion to time local calls and base bills

Doug McKeon is burning up———he’s
getting dangerously close to college
without hitting a “home run” with
any girl, much less Kelly Preston,
the cutest one in the class. Let’s face
it—it’s the 1950’s, and Doug would
settle for a “single”. That is, until
big city buddy (and screen newcom-
er) Chris Nash arrives at school and
bets that he can help Doug hit a
grand slam.

A winning cast

The cast of “Mischief” is particu-
larly hip. Doug McKeon is best
known as the “suck-face” kid in
“On Golden Pond”. Kelly Preston,
soon to be seen in the upcoming
“Secret Admirer”, played the lus-
cious damsel in distress in “Metal

 

"Please, MariIyn—i!'s been 18 years! ”(

Storm”. Cathei ne Mary Stewart,
who plays Chris Nash’s girlfriend,
was a smash hit as the lead in both
“Night of the Cornet” and “The
Last Starfighter”.

Major league mischief

Together, Doug, Kelly, Chris and
Catherine stir up more rowdy “mis-
chief” than little Nelsonville, Ohio
can take in one year. We’re talking
major league tomfoolery here:
motorcycles on sidewalks, cars on
fire hydrants, parents on the war-
path, romance on the sly. In short,
all the things that make life worth
living before college.

The cars may have changed, but the .

action in the back seat has not!

Pittsburgh Dance Council presents New York City's

1984 — a year of change
for student radio station

By Lisa G. Gordon
The Pitt News

Last year was a year of change for
WPTS. To begin with, the station’s
move from AM to FM has increased
the size of its potential audience
from only those in the dormitories to
20,000 listeners. And other changes
are still taking place.

According to program director
Chris Kramer, the station is trying to
get the syndicated “Dr. Demento"
for a Sunday night slot. The cost
would be underwritten by a pharma-
ceutical company who would spon-
sor it. When and if this takes place,
the old. station manager will proba-
bly be gone.

K.J. Jones, who is the present
manager, is graduating, which will
leave a vacancy in one of the sta-
tion’s top positions. Kramer would
not comment on who will succeed
him.

A marketing department has
recently been formed. Darla Grif-
fith, director of marketing, is pres-
ently working on two promotional
ideas aimed at building the station’s
image. ’

The first idea is to advertise on
PAT buses. PAT buses have panels
that display ads from various com-
panies and organizations. “What we
are getting underway, and it will
hopefully be done in February, is a
bus promotion where we will place
our advertisements on the busses,”

lGri_ffith said.

The second idea involves printing
WPTS’ logo on bags which Oakland
merchants will be invited to use. The
marketing department hopes to
agree on a logo soon. Griffith said,
“I can’t tell you how many logos
have already been shot down.” She
said the logo should be finalized by

the end of January.

The end of January will also spark
the radio station’s first ice skating
party, with a live broadcast from
Schenley Ice Rink. It is being spon-
sored by the station and the Resi-
dent Student Association.
Admission is free and there will be
complimentary cocoa, soda and
snacks. .

Formerly WPGH, WPTS can be
found at 98.5 on the FM dial. The
station had tried to acquire WRCT’s
(CMU’s station) spot. “We wanted
their spot and offered them plenty of
things for it, but they would not
budge,” Kramer said. “The reason is
that people in Oakland are always
suspicious of Pitt.”

The move was spurred, according
to Kramer, because “if you weren’t
in the dorms, you couldn’t hear us.
Now we can be heard in all of
Allegheny County. On a good day
we have an 18-mile radius and an
even larger north radius." The north
radius is larger because the antenna
points in that direction.

Their music format includes air-
time for current music, potential hits
and oldies. According to Kramer,
the format “is eclectic, progressive,
album-oriented rock. We can play a
potential hit because we don’t have
to worry about advertising. Or if
someone makes a request, our policy
is ‘If we have it, we'll play it!’ ”

The station does not play com-
mercials as they are a non-
commercial classified FM station.
But they do have a method for get-
ting around not being able to
advertise.

“When a sponsor pays for an
hour, we can get on the radio and say
something to the effect, ‘This hour
has been brought to you by  ,’ ”
Kramer explained.

But they are not exempt from the
Emergency Broadcast Test. When
asked what it was for, Kramer rep-
lied, “In case the Russians attack.
But I don’t see how that [the test] can

help because it they did all we could
do is put our heads between our legs
and kiss our *&!3 goodbye.”

If an emergency did occur, they
would receive a message with a code
word from KDKA, the Pittsburgh
area emergency ﬂagship station.
They immediately tell listeners to
tune into KDKA.and sign off.

Being a discjockey is open to any
student — all they have to do is show
an interest. Students are trained by a
competent DJ and given a room to
practice in. When they feel they are
ready, Kramer gives them a board
test.

“The test I give, very few people
pass the first time,” Kramer said. I
make them go on play-air in another
studio for about a half-hour. I make
sure that something goes wrong
because it always happens and they
should be prepared.” '

The other day he gave a test and
pulled out one of the turntable
plugs. The student taking the test
forgot to turn off the mike and
swore. He failed.

Presently, there are between 30
and 40 DJ’s and none of them get
paid. The station has also fired and

‘ suspended DJ ‘s, too. Recently, a DJ

missed his airshift for a week and
Kramer let him go. Once Jones, the
station manager, broke a record and
got suspended. Jones had broken a
scratched album before throwing it
in the garbage. Kramer compared
this questionable suspension to the
triumph of Woodward and Bern-
stein: “Just like Watergate showed
the president was not above the law,
I also judge fairly."

Pittsburgh has the l4th largest
radio market in the United States, so
any experience in the city can add a
feather to the cap. “Not only is it the
l4th biggest, it is the most stagnant,”
Kramer said. “That is where WPTS
is making an impact. We can play
what we want and other stations are
starting to pay more attention to
us."

need. They stood silent; immobile

heirs to an ancient and noble tradi-
tion in a land where pain is a way of
life  All at once a smile began to
brighten on those pained, exhausted
faces; .1 ray of hope danced in their
eyes.”

She spoke of the effort that is
underway. She said that the food
and water that were coming in could
not keep coming in forever. Her
hope for the future is to load a ship
with IO tons of tools and equipment,
and a team of men who would teach
the native people how to use them.
Fanfani spoke to many people who
were very pleased with the food.
They were afraid, however, that
once the original hunger had dimin-
ished, the help would disappear.

The people were in the same

. straits many times before. Drought

struck; the food disappeared. Other
countries immediately began ship-
ping in food. This lasted only until
the environment had a chance to rec-
over. Fanfani hoped that the “so-
called civilized nations” would
finally take steps to stop this cycle,
involving contributions of tools and
technology, along with the people
who know how to use them. She
elaborated further on her plan, say-
ing: “I would like to see each country
in the Red Cross network take a
country in Africa; Djibouti, Ethio-
pia, etc. People are always talking
about Ethiopia. All of the countries
in Africa are in desperate need of
help. Each country would stay in
that nation it was helping until all
the work was finalized.”

During the slide show, she spoke
of the constant death and desola-

frﬁifrifrﬂriﬁrﬁﬂrﬂrﬂrﬁﬁrﬁﬂrﬁﬁrﬁrirﬁﬁﬂrfrﬁﬂrﬁfrfrﬁTfnfr

frﬁikgﬁirﬁﬁikikﬁirﬁﬁﬁﬁﬁrﬁﬁﬁikﬁikir

tion. “I don’t have as many slides as I
would like to have. So many times I
was overcome by the sheer tragedy
ofwhat I saw. One morning I saw 40
children die from the cold during the
night.“ Their environment has
turned to desert. The days are
incredibly hot but there are no
clouds to hold the heat in. The cold
that begins when the sun goes down
is even worse for the people that
have no energy to warm themselves.

One of the SildCS pictured three
children gathered together in front
of their mother, who had died dur-
ing the night. She was covered with a
dingy blanket; beside her lay a white
linen cloth that would serve as her
shroud. “All of the families have
these white linens" said Fanfani.

“They use them to bury the members
of the family that eventually die.
They want the dead to be buried in
something clean." ‘

Many of the slides were taken at
one of the hospital centers in Dji-
bouti. Twenty thousand people were
gathered at the site. Some were given
medicine to help alleviate the ills
that weakened them. Fanfani admit-
ted, “The medicine is not enough.

The people need hospitals. Often,
even after they’d been given medi-
cine, they would die during the
night.” I

She showed photos of the Italian
“hospitals,” which are differentiated
from the others by color. The hospi-
tals are little more than tents, and
the patients lie on the floor. Occa-
sionally, one of the patients will be

According to Fanfani, these tents
provide adequate shelter. The typi-
cal Djibouti house consists of just
five or six rocks that serve as a cook-
ing area. The tents provide enough
shelter for the afflicted to recuper-
ate. Once they have recovered
enough to survive from day to day,

they are transferred by Russian
helicopter to another part of the
country. Fanfani said that this
breaks the spirit of the people. She
told of a scene in which natives were
being loaded into a helicopter for
transfer to another camp. Most were
crying. “They were being pulled
away from their roots. This was the
land that held so many memories for
them. They did not want to leave the

desolation that was all around
them.”
Fanfani described the land:

“When I arrived, I could not have
imagined I would come face to face
with a landscape so completely dev-
estated by drought. All that remains
is a desert ofdusty rock at the foot of
mountains that seem to point
toward the sky in defiance. I saw
miles of putty-colored plains —~ a.
lunar landscape of small dark crat-
ers that seemed to cry out for water,

a sight reminiscent of volcanoes
extinguished by violent eruptions. It
was as if some ancient curse cast
upon this land had snuffed out all
forms of life.

“Everything seemed new to me,

although I thought I knew Africa
well. In Djibouti and Ethiopia, I saw

the proud people of the mountains
and the pastoral nomads. They
stood like stone statues silhouetted
against the background of a sore
landscape scorched by the sun and
swept bare by the relentless wind.
They were the human embodiment
of a land that time forgot.”

In conclusion, she said to the
members of the Red Cross, “We
must work together if we want to
really do something. There are so
many things to do. Above all, we
must continue to help."

Fanfani said that even as desper-
ate as the people are for food and
water, they also need intangibles.
“When I caressed the face of one of
the children who sat in the crowd of
people, he looked up to ‘me and
smiled.” She said the constant mov-
ing and wandering in search of food
has driven some of the people mad.
One of the slides pictured a small
boy tethered to his father. Fanfani
approached the man and asked
why. “He said that his son would run
off, without the family, in search of
water.” In another case she saw a
man running across the desert. “He
was screaming to the sky, ‘Food!
Food! Food!’ ”

Finally, she told of a man who
asked what the red cross on the tents
meant. “I told him it was the symbol
of an army in march, fighting for
love.”

Award given
to Hamilton

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — The
Philadelphia Sports Writers Associ-
ation Monday night named,26-year-
old Scott Hamilton of Denver Most
Courageous Athlete for 1984.

Hamilton began skating as a child
as therapy for a near-fatal intestinal
disease and went on to dominate the
sport.

The athlete who won the Olympic
figure skating gold medal last year at
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, was honored
by the association at its 8 lst annual
awards dinner in Cherry Hill, N.J.

Hamilton was afﬂicted with an
intestinal disease diagnosed as
Schwachmann’s Syndrome at the
age of 5. The disease prevented his
body from absorbing nutrients,
leaving him in danger of starving
himself to death. He also s.:_'»ped
growing.

After years of treatment, Hamil-
ton" finally recovered from his illness
and plunged headlong into his new
sport. Hamilton said his illness and
recovery gave him the determination
to pursue his career.

Altzheimer’s
looked into

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — Doctors
at West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh
said more than 200 people have
volunteered to be part of a study on
a drug designed to control symp-
toms of Alzheimer’s disease.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 23, I985

Doctors said they need 20 patients
with the disease to test whether or
not the drug bethanechol can ease or
eliminate the senility-like symptoms
of the disease. The drug will be sup-
plied to the brain through a small
pump implanted under the skin in
the abdomen.

Tests have shown that the drug
may serve the same function as a
chemical believed absent in the
brains of Alzheimer’s victims.

The U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration has authorized I2 hospi-
tals, including West Penn, to begin
six-month experiments’ with 20
patients.

Doctors said even if the drug is
successful it will not cure the disease.
But it will allow victims to lead more
normal lives.

Reagan urges

economic boost

WASHINGTON (UPI) — At
11:48 a.m. Monday, Ronald Reagan
repeated his oath of service to the
American public beneath the
rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.

One thousand Washington digni-
taries looked on and heard the 40th
president call in his inaugural
address for an economic surge that
would unleash a new dynamism
even in the most distressed areas of
the United States.

"It was also a speech that called for
a freeze on government spending,
lower deficits, tax reform, a strong
national defense and negotiated
arms reductions.

69 dead after
plane crashes

RENO, Nev. (UPI) — There's
very little left of the Lockheed Elec-
tra that crashed after takeoff from
Reno early Monday morning.

The turbo-prop went down on a
sales lot filled with recreational vehi-
cles, throwing up a ball of flame on
impact and killing up to 69 people. A
deputy sheriff who watched the
charter aircraft hit the ground said
he saw two people hurtle across the
highway next to the sales lot - still
strapped to their seats.

One of those people may have
been I7-year-old George Lamson.
Along with his father and the other
passengers, he was returning to Min-
nesota from a gambling weekend at
Lake Tahoe.

After the crash, he found himself
sitting in the icy night air on US.
Highway 395, still belted to his seat.
He unbuckled himself and walked
away with a cut on his head and a
burned arm.

Lamson‘s father, George Sr., also
survived, but with fractures to his
skull, face and leg, and burns over I5
percent of his body.

A third survivor who ran scream-
ing from the wreckage with his
clothing on ﬁre has third degree
burns over 80 percent of his body.

The same Lockheed Electra car-
ried Democratic presidential candi-
dates Jesse Jackson and John Glenn
during their campaigns last year.

The pilot reported just before the
Galaxy Airlines plane went down
that the plane was vibrating.

On their way: Panthers, Smith stun.BC

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

9’ CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. —

in

For several precious hours after the
basketball game, word was that the
victory served as a sign of things to
come. Euphoria was that prevalent,
yet tempered, after the Panthers
wrested a 6 l -55 victory from the pre-
viously sure talons of Boston Col-
lege Monday night.

Pitt’s (I0-5, 2-3) first win in four
games proved to be the Eagles’(l 1-5,
2-5) fifth setback in a half dozen
tries.

Roberts Center — your next-best
thing to walk-in closets — is not the
enclosure struggling teams necessar-
ily look toward to undo losing
streaks. Definitely not for the
Panthers. Yet it wasn’t so much the
safety-valve victory that stood out as
did how Pitt jostled to erase a 14-
point, second-half deficit.

It did it with youth for the better
part of 15 minutes there. Seniors
were hard to decipher as Coach Roy
Chipman stuck with his frontcourt
of Charles Smith, Darryl Shepherd
and Keith Armstrong. Behind them
were the three years worth of expe-
rience in Curtis Aiken and Deme-
treus Gore.

“Anytime we rang, they answered
the call,” Chipman said ofthe future
of our ballclub. “When the game was
on the line, they wanted to win the
game."

“We were making a lot of mis-
takes in the first half, and were not
very aggressive in the first half,”
Smith said, accurately portraying
both teams’ play. “Then by the
second half B.C. had that spurt, the
same thing that happened against
El88‘r§Et8Wll: By tlléll WE RHEW HBW
to react at the end.”

The end greeted the Panthers
early, as in with 15:22 remaining,
after the Eagles‘ Dom Pressley con-

verted an eight-footjumper, making
it 42-28.

Then The Youth took over, iron-
ing out a 16-6 spurt ofits own to trail
46-44 with 6:54 remaining. Before it
was over, Shepherd would play all
17 ofthe minutes credited him in the
second half before fouling out with
eight crucial points and the fresh-
man Smith would lead all scorers
with 26 points, setting two school
records with 18 free throws in 21
attempts.

“We needed offense and he not
only gave us offense, but rebounded
the ball,” Chipman said ofthejunior
who should byinow get used to the
calling of ‘Short Notice’ Shepherd.
All year he has produced consis-
tently well cold off the bench.

“I just like the way the kids came
in and didn't back off," Chipman
added.

The 3,429 fans whipped into a
frenzy by now, Gore, a freshman,
arched an eight-foot baseline shot
putting Pitt ahead to stay for good
56-55 just before Trevor Gordon
missed two freebies with :29 remain-
ing. The 6-9, 235-lb. JUCO transfer
has been a dike at the pivot along
with fellowjunior Roger McCready.

Both helped bring Pitt to its knees
before the 33-25 intermission as the
Panthers scored on only 22.7 per-
cent of their shots (5-22). Even so,
both sides —— like children with
matchsticks and kerosene — played
costly turnover and pass-out-of-
bounds games in the first half.

After deﬂating double-digit leads
on the road against Florida State

and Connecticut, the Panthers were
not about to let it happen again.

“I have to credit the coaching statt
for this one,” Aiken said. “They pre-
pared us well, more mentally than
ever before; Motivating us with
words. AndCoachplayed us well. He
was subbing at the right times. When
[Charles Thompson and Shepherd]
came off the bench, they were ready

happen," Thompson said. “I could
see little things Curtis wasn't doing.
A little more penetration, moving
the ball back and forth with full
force. All Coach said is work hard
and things will work out.”

“We got a lot of key rebounds,”

Chipman said of Pitt‘s play during ‘

its breakaway gallop. “And there
were no easy shots. My feeling is
defense had something to do with it.
We were coming at [B.C.] strong.”

Reasons for easing up are
drowned out by Saturday’s game
against Syracuse and Tuesday
night’s rendezvous with Villanova in
its “Cat House."

“We’re right where we want to
be,” Aiken said. “Games we won in
the past, games lost in the past are all
behind us — awful or bad. Now, we
have to work hard."

OFF THE BOARDS: Freshman
Junie Lewis was disciplined for the
second time this season when he was
sent home before the game, punish-
ment enough, Chipman said, for
missing an ll:30 p.m. curfew Sun-
day night. .

“Right now it’s only a disciplinary
action," the tight-lipped coach said.
Lewis had earlier missed a team
meeting before the Panthers‘ 83-76
road loss to Florida State.

_ The Eagles’ loss was not only their
first to Pitt since 1959, but also their
tenth in 76 -Big East games played at
Roberts Center.

Charles Smith led all scorers with 26 points.

McRae smashes record at Kodak,

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

As the world was watching this
past summer's Olympic games in
Los Angeles, certain victories meant
certain things to different people.
For those in Pittsburgh, nothing
stood out more than Roger-King-
dom's gold medal triumph in the
l 10-meter high hurdles. Call it pride,
if you will.

In any case, Pitt may have found
Roger’s legacy in freshman extraor-
dinaire Lee McRae. As a highly rec-
ruited high school All-America out
of Pembroke, N.J.. McRae has been
nothing short of spectacular in com-
piling a 4-0 record against some of
the toughest competition in the
nation.

Head coach John Vasvarydoesn‘t
seem a bit surprised. “Of course,
we're pleased with his performance
so far." Vasvary explained. "He's

finally showing people how good he
really is."

Vasvary continued. "When he
went up against the sprinters at East
Tennessee. he was facing some ofthe
best in the nation. The Southeast
conference is always well
represented." '

The speed of McRae‘s contribu-
tion to the record books thus far in
his young career is approaching the
pace of Dan Marino's passing
records of this past season —— and
that's no overstatement.

Try these for starters:

December — He qualified for the
lC4A Championships in the 50-yard
dash with a time of 5.2 at a Pitt
developmental meet. He set a school
record with this time and tied a Fitz-
gerald Field House record.

At the George Mason Invita-
tional. he gained two victories in the
300-meter run and set a school
record with a 0.26 ‘in the 55-meter
dash.

January — He qualiﬁed for the
NCAA Championships in the 55-

gunheralded freshman noticed

meter dash during a recent meet at
East Tennessee State. The Cham-
pionships will be held March 8-9 in
Syracuse. ’

All this, and only a freshman.

Vasvary commented that his
quick improvement is the result of
practice and experience. “We work
on little things in practice.” Vasvary
said. "But it's these little things that
make the bit: things happen.”

McRae. a sprinter. was also an
Olympic trials qualifier with a l0.l
in the l l-meter — even before com-
ing to Pitt.

McRae explained. '‘I was happy
with my performance at the trials.
but qualifying for the .\'C.-\.-\s is the
biggest thing that's happened to me
so tar  I'm really looking forward
to it."

Strong coaching is the key to any
athlete's success. With Vasvary and
assistant coach Steven Lewis at the
helm. there's no telling how far
McRae can go.

"The coaches have been great to

Pitt head football coach Foge
Fazio feels he has found the
offensive coordinator he was
looking for in former Utah head
coach Chuck Stobart.

“He'll be in charge of our
offense, and I believe it will be in
good hands," said Fazio yester-
day over the telephone from
Toledo, where he is on a recruit-
ing trip. “In our search for an
offensive coordinator, we felt he
was the ideal guy.

“He’s concentrated on the

offense at Utah and Toledo, and-

both were among the national
leaders in that category when he
was in charge.”

“He’s gotten good recommen-
dations from people like Lavell
Edwards of Brigham Young,
who competed against him in the
WAC Conference, Schen-
bechler, and pro people like Gil
Brandt of the Dallas Cowboys.”

The 50-year-old Stobart had
been head coach of the Utes for
three seasons and posted a 16-
17-1 record there. Before that, he
was head coach for five years at
the University of Toledo. He was
the offensive backfield coach for
eight seasons at Michigan, for
two years at Miami of Ohio and
four earlier one-year stints at the
start of his career at Marshall
and Cincinatti.

He was dismissed at Utah after
the 1984 season, when the Utes
posted a 6-5-1 record following

‘two 5-6 showings. In 1983, the
Utes ranked eighth in the nation

. in total offense and were llth in

the nation last year.

PITTSBURGH — If you were to
see Renee Henderson walking down
the street, you would most likely
find yourself stopping and taking a
second look. It is not only her attrac-
tiveness that draws attention to her,
but also her bright smile and bubbly

ﬂ personality.

Henderson, a senior on the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Lady Panther
track team, is never without a smile.
Whether it be after a tiring practice
or a long class, her smile is always
apparent. Being cheerful is just a
part of her style.

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will be looking to make a move
upward in the Big East standings
tonight when they host the Univer-

O sity of Connecticut at 7:30 p.m. at

Fitzgerald Field House.

Coach Judy Saurer’s squad is cur-
rently 4-3 and will need some help
inside the conference if they are
going to get back into the race for
the Big East championship, but no
one is surrendering yet. ‘.‘The season
is still young,” said Saurer..“Hope-
fully we can get some help with some
losses by these other teams.”

C These other teams are the likes oi

Villanova, St. John’s and Boston
College, all currently ahead of Pitt in
the Big East. Pitt lost to these three
by a combined total of eight points.
That’s what kind of season it has
been for Saurer and the Panthers.
Tonight presents the opportunity

“Renee always does what is asked
of her," said Coach Elbert Kennedy,
who has been her coach since she
began running. “She has done it all
at a very competitive rate. She is
very durable.

. “Also, she is a class person. She
represents Pitt well. People are
always talking positively about her.
She has respect on and off the track.
She has shown that you can be a
good athlete, student and lady at the
same time.“

The talented sprinter competed in
her first meet ofthe season recently.
She missed the first few due to an
injury. “I didn’t get hurt running,”
Henderson explained. “I was walk-

As frustrated as Pitt has been, it
has been worse for the Huskies from
UConn. The Huskies are currently
l-6 in the Big East and occupy the
conference cellar. Their only confer-
ence victory comes over a Seton Hall
club that Pitt defeated by 18 points
earlier in the year. _ g _

Fifth-year coach Jean Balthaser
looks to senior Leigh Curl, an aca-
demic All-America from nearby
North Hills High School in Pitts-
burgh, and junior Peggy Walsh to
provide most of the Huskies’
offense. Both are averaging over 14
ppg and are what Saurer described
as “good shooters.”

Joining Curl and Walsh in the
lineup will be sophomores Lori Kulo
and Tammi Sweet and freshman Jill

twist resulted in a broken bone in her
right foot.

“It will affect her until late in the
indoor season or early in the out-
door,” Kennedy said. “We will use
her in low key meets as rehabilita-
tion. The injury will really limit her
events. It is dissappointing since it is
her senior year.”

Henderson, who always looks at
the bright side, is not letting her
injury get her down. “At first I was

Profile in courage: Tricia Ney pushes on

Dave Hooker/T74e'Pitt News. .
Tricia Ney has refused to let physical handicap stop her.

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

Still recovering from the frigid
walk to the Towers lobby, Tricia
Ney’s eyes lit up when the 1988
Olympics were mentioned. The
sophomore on the Pitt women's div-
ing team is planning a bright future
for her team as well as for herself.

Ney, a 19 year old from Chalfont
Pa., started diving when she was ll
years old. According to Ney, she got
interested in diving after watching a
diver while she was swimming at a
nearby pool. “It looked like fun, sol
tried it. I've been diving competi-
tively ever since."

Through the course of her diving
experience Ney has had to learn to
deal with some obstacles. One such
obstacle is her deafness.

Ney’s parents discovered she was
deaf when she was two and a half
years old. Her mother realized there
was a problem when she’d call and
her daughter wouldn’t respond.‘ Ney
went to several doctors. They finally
confirmed that she was deaf.
According to Ney, the exact cause of
her deafness is not known, but she

‘said that she does have some nerve

damage in her ears.
Ney has been determined not to
let her deafness hinder her develop-

ment as a diver. She said that she has
had to make some minor adjust-
ments. When she was in high school,
for example, she had to go outside of
the school to find a coach who could
handle her deafness. That is when
she began training under Karen
Deyer.

Deyer worked out a signal system
with her that they could use in place
of the verbal cues that coaches often
use in practice. “Karen used lights as
a visual cue for me to kick my feet
out. The only problem with that was
I had to keep my eyes open in order
for the cue to help,” she said.

According to Ney’s diving coach
at Pitt, Julian Krug, Ney doesn’t use
deafness as an excuse in diving. He
said that he makes sure he is looking
directly at her so that she can read
his lips to be sure she is doing the
right dive. He said that he also uses
hand signals to communicate with
her while she is diving.

Ney, who was interested in both
Clarion and Pitt, decided to attend
Pitt following her graduation from
Central Bucks West High School.
“The diving program at Pitt seemed
more together and supportive and
they had the best facilities. I also
liked their Athlete Support Services.
I knew that I would be more comfor-
table at Pitt.” ‘

-According to Krug, the Athlete .

Support Services provide Ney an

interpreter for her classes. “When a
professor is turned around writing
on the board, Tricia misses what
they are saying. The service pays for
someone to help her take notes and
interpret for her,” Krug said.

By putting her deafness behind
her Ney has had a consistent season
thus far. She has attained at least
five first place scores in the six meets
so far this season.

Last season Ney was slowed down
by an injured finger and mono for
three months. But she came back
later in the season to set a team
record in the one-meter board.

“She has always had a good atti-
tude and has worked exceptionally
hard.” Krug said. “This year she’s
got the capacity to handle things bet-
ter. When she doesn’t do well in
practice she used to take it too hard.
Now she can put it behind her and
keep going.”

Ney's performances this year,
along with Jennifer Brown, Tricia
Schultz and the other women divers,
have contributed to the undefeated
record of the Lady Panther swim-
ming and diving team. “I feel really
good about this year." Ney said.
“Practices have gone well, although
I get picky about my performances.”

According to Ney, Krug has had a

- strong influence in her development

in diving on the collegiate level.
“Julian gives me as much individual
attention as he can. He is pacing me
so that I don't peak at this point in
the season. I have to save that for the
NCAA pre-qualifiers in the spring.”
Krug added, “She has done excellent

THE GAY 8c LESBIAN ALLIANCE

Martin and Emore fitting in

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

When it comes to the great teams,
seldom do true champions gain suc-
cess without the combination oftwo
important elements: experience and
youth. This year's men’s swimming
team is no exception. With proven
experience in the upperclassmen
being combined with a promising
batch of young freshmen, a third
consecutive Big East title appears
within reach. Senior Geoff Emore
and junior Donald Martin are two
key reasons for this.

Martin, last year’s team MVP,
believes this balance of swimmers is
an important element in terms of
success. “The team has really
strengthened with our large number‘
of freshmen," he said. “We lost a lot
of seniors last year, but they (the
freshmen) made up for it  they
have unlimited potential.”

Born in Africa, Martin began
swimming competitively in clubs
under the suggestion of a coach.
Now coached by Fred Lewis, Martin
has no regrets about attending Pitt.
“I met Coach Lewis before coming
here and I liked his coaching style,”
Martin stated, “although the reputa-
tion ofthe engineering program was
a big factor, too."

Pitt swimming couldn't be hap-
pier. Since concentrating early on a
strict weight training program, Mar-
tin gained 10 important pounds
before his sophomore year.

“The training made me stronger ,’
Martin said. “Last year was very
successful for me. I had the best
times in all my events.”

Successful may not be the word as
Martin went undefeated in all colle-
giate dual meets in the 200-meter
breaststroke and won this event
along with the 400 IM at last year's
Big East meet. He capped this off by

9

' capturing the 200-meter backstroke

title at the Eastern Championships.

This year, Martin has his eye set
on qualifying for the NCAAS and
possible All-America honors, but
said his biggest thrills were “qualify-

Geoff Emore

Don Martin

ing for senior nationals in high
school and beating Penn State last
year.”

The story of senior co—captain
Geoff Emore is just as colorful.
Although he sat out last season as a
redshirt, he is still the team's best
butterfly performer and was team
MVP in 1983.

Emore began swimming at the age
of eight at a summer club. In high
school, he spent most of his time
with the swim team, notjoining any
specialized clubs like many success-
ful swimmers.

To some, this may appear a set-
back, but for Emore it did not hinder
his performance as his collegiate
career indicates. Geoff's biggest
thrills: “Being a member of Pitts-
burgh's 400 medley relay team in the
NCAAS as a sophomore, although
beating Penn State and Virginia this
year felt good.”

Emore came to Pitt for the reputa-
tion of the swimming team and the
engineering program. Now in his
fifth year, he has seen many
swimmers come and go, but feels
this could prove to be the strongest
Pitt team ever. “This team is coming
along really well,” he commented.
“Another Big East championship is
definitely possible."

The men’s team is now aiming
toward Saturday as they serve host
to West Virginia at Trees Pool. Both
swimmers indicate a strong desire to
win, but for different reasons.

“We lost to them the last two
years,” Martin stated. ‘‘I’d like to
change that this year and I think we
have the team to do it.”

Emore agrees. “Beating West Vir-
ginia in swimming is like beating
Penn State in football . . . the rivalry
is that great. A victory would be sure
to enhance our season.”

Defeating the Mountaineers will
be no easy task as a total team effort
from the Panthers will be needed. As
a close-knit squad, Pitt has no inter-
squad rivalries. Team members are
always ready to help each other out,
many times giving praise to one
another. Said Geoff Emore,
“Donald Martin is an excellent
swimmer who can be used almost
anywhere -— freestyle, breaststroke,
he can do it all.”

That's a tough compliment to live
up to. Head coach Fred Lewis puts it
all in perspective as he remarked ear-
lier this year, “What Geoff can’t
swim, Donald can. It’s aperfect fit."

Wrestlers host Kent State

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The Pitt Panthers prepare to host
Kent State in a match which prom-
ises to please the crowd with its
intensity and excitement.

“Our schedule includes tough
competition from here on out as we
meet Kent State on Thursday and

~ Purdue at Ashland on Saturday,”

explained head coach Rande Stot-
tlemeyer. “We gave the guys a short
break over the weekend and now
they're back on the mat practicing,
looking forward to the challenges
ahead.”

“Kent State is a strong team and
they may be tough to beat, but if we
go out and wrestle to our abilities,

Just no

c_ontinued from page fourteen
really show her potential ar; the
championship meets later on in the
season. That's when she should be at
her sharpest.

Although Ney is keeping the
NCAA Championships in the back
of her mind, she is first concerned
with getting the team wins during
the dual meet season. “Right now I
am mainly concerned with scoring
the team points when I compete.
When I go to Harvard for_ the
NCAA pre—qual, I'll be more con-

we're sure to make it a close compe-
tition," continued Stottlemyer. “We
haven't seen their lineup but we're
sure to expect strengths, particularly
at I18 and l77 lbs."

Panther Joe lagriema, who wres-
tles at 118 lbs., will face stiff compe-
tition against Kent State's Don
Honning. Honning captured the
title at the Midlands, a prestigious
Christmas tournament held in Chi-
cago, lll.

“Joe's young and he still has some
weaknesses, but he's been doing well
and we're sure he'll give I50 percent.
It's that kind of match where you
don’t mail in the results in advance
— youjust let them go out and wres-
tle the bout and see how things work
out," said Stottlemyer. I

Not only will the Panthers be pre-
pared physically to meet the chal-

lenges that lie ahmd of them, but
prepared mentally as well — as their
enthusiasm and desire show. “The
team's spirit and attitude are excel-
lent," explained assistant coach Jack
Spates. “We will certainly attack our
competition head on. No one will be
able to blow us out; we're going to be
right in there in every match.

“We'll need to receive the perfect

' effort from each individual in order

for us to contend," continued
Spates. “But the guys have been
working hard and they're in excel-
lent physical and mental condition.
The upcoming matches are sure to
offer great intensity."

The match against Kent State is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m.
Thursday and will be held at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

stopping N ey

cerned with my individual
performance."

As for the future, Ney seems to
have everything in line. She wants to
win on both boards at the Big East
Championship, then make the top
two at the NCAA pre-qualifying
meet, then make the top eight in the
national competition, which would
make her an All—America in diving
and finally she'd like to qualify for
the Olympic Trials this season.

According to Ney, in order for her
to qualify for the Olympic Trials,

she'd have to be one of the top four
in the country. It seems like an awful
lot to shoot for in one year but Ney
has got the determination. “I want to
be an All—America," she said. ‘‘I
know what I have to do to achieve
that, and that is hard work.”

According to Krug, an Olympic
gold medal is not out of reach for
Ney. “It's possible with the way she
is. She wants to be the best. To make
it that far you've got to dive like a
genius. She just has to keep up her
determination."

Henderson .
runs past injury

 

Renee Henderson, a three-time
team MVP and All-America.is
hoping for her best year yet.

continued from page thirteen
because I had not run since Thanks-
giving. But I am working on it. Ijust
have to take it as it comes.”

Aside from track, Henderson
finds plenty of other things to keep
her busy. The English writing/com-
munications major is very serious
about her studies. She is always try-
ing to do a little extra, and that
includes internships.

Currently she is an intern at
KDKA-TV and is working as a pro-
duction assistant. She is mainly
involved with _t_h_e_shq_ws “Vy_eekend

 

 

Magazine” and “Vibrations" and
she has produced two programs. She
also helps with the writing of some
of the shows’ feature stories.

Last summer, she displaved her
talents as an intern in the Pitt Sports
Information Office. She wrote fea-
tures on different Pitt athletes and
helped with the publication of Pitt‘s
All—Sports Yearbook.

It seems like a lot of responsibil-
ity, but Henderson is able to handle
it. “lt’s no problem balancing school
and track,” Henderson said. “I‘ve
been doing it for so long. It is a part
of what I normally do. lfyou really
want to do something, you find a
way to do it.

“I’ve had to make some sacrifices,
but I don’t mind. I am usually gone
every weekend so I do miss some
things. I don’t have time to get
involved in other things at Pitt."

Henderson began running when
she was nine with the New Image
Track Club, of which Kennedy is the
coach. Since coming to Pitt she has
set numerous school records as well
as Big East ones. She is hard work-
ing, dedicated and she has the com-
petitive spirit possessed by winners.

“She is an inspiration to other
kids on the team,” Kennedy said.

She is also an inspiration to those
who see her walking downthe street.
Her bright smile is contagious and
gives those around her the urge to
smile.

me," McRae stated. “They're behind
me I00 percent.”

Besides McRae’s complete perfor-
mance this past weekend at the
Kodak Invitational in Johnson City,
Tenn., an additional school record
was in the men's mile-relay. Jun-
ior Dorrill Hilliman, and sopho-
more Alan Laws, Rodney Giles, and
Jesse Mikell comprised the record

setting quartet.

Individual performers, all qualify-
ing for the lC4As include freshman
Calvin Holmes in the 60 high hur-
dles, Scott Abel in the 1,000-meter
run and Roger Thomas in the 60-
meter run.

Finally, the distance medley relay
team of Tim Manes, Alan Laws,
Rodney Giles and Bob Weiner
gained a spot in the lC4As by taking
a fifth place at the weekend meet.

The Pitt men’s track team is offto
a promising start, thanks partly to
the closeness of the team. Lee
McRae said it all, “The team unity is
_so high  it’s just like family.”
