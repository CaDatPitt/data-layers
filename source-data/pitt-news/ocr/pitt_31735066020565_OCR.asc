On Sept. 24, fossils dating back 50
million years were ' found in the
Wind River basin at the base of the
Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming.
The two discoverers are from the
Carnegie Museum of Natural His-
tory —.Dr. Leonard Krishtalka and
Dr. Richard Stucky. If the name
Krishtalka sounds familiar, it’s
because he teaches at Pitt.

It all started 40 years ago. when the

paleontologists ‘at .the Carnegie

Museum of Natural History first
became interested in the Wind River
Basin area of Wyoming. When

Krishtalka started col‘ sting pieces ‘

of scattered bone‘ 1 -this remote
desert, he only followed in the foot-
steps of early workers. Seven years
ago, Stucky joinedthe field group.

“You don’t know where there are
going to be fossils until you go and
look. You don’t go to areas that have
tremendous vegetation cover; you
want to go to areas where there is

erosion, where the fossils are being

eroded out of the rock. If‘ you are

 

One more time p

election debate.

Arms race issues dominate the second presidential

looking for animals of a particular
age, then you‘ go to areas where
rocks of that age are exposed at the
surface," said Krishtalka.

Once there, we prospect. “We
walk over the badlands  and some-
times crawl over them and collect
the remains. Usually, they are scat-
tered; you prospect and find a bone
here, a jaw there. Sometimes you

find concentrations of fossils in.

small pockets that we found this
summer,” he added.

Once a bone is found, it is taken to
the‘ museum’s lab. The age of the
bone is determined by radiometric
dating of the rocks from which they

‘ came. This includes measuring the

decays of carbon 14 and other radio-
isotopes.

“There is another way of dating
rocks called faunal correlation. You

compare all animals from one group i

of rocks to other such faunasfrom
other rocks which have been already
dated,” said Krishtalka. If the fau-
nas are similar, then it’s probable
that they have come from rocks of
the same age. ‘ 
“When you find fossils like we did

A this summer —— so many ofthem and

so exquisitely preserved —- the first
thought is:.we have a tremendous
wealth of materials to answer some
of the questions we have been asking
ourselves. What is the tempo and
mode of evolution? Do species
change slowly one into the other, or
do species evolve abruptly and then
remain unchanged for millions of
years until-they go extinct?” ‘
The potential to answer those
important questions stirs an interest
in the scientific world of natural his-
tory. “We now-know a great deal
more about the kinds of animals that
were living in the American. West 50
million years ago. We know a lot
more about not only who they were
but what they looked like .— their
anatomy,” said Kristalka. '

“Most of these animals were‘

known to science but were only
known from fragmentary teeth and
jaws; now, we’ve recovered skulls,
partial skulls, complete jaws, partial
skeletons. We’ve.probably found a
total of about a hundred species; 10
to 15 percent of those are new, but
that’s not unusual. Plus, it’s only the
beginning. We’ve only excavated
about 10 percent of the quarries."

Speaker opposes  i
  legalized abortion

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

The Pitt Students for Life organi-
zation. made their point clear Thurs-
day night, in a group sponsored
lecture entitled “The Politics of
Abortion.” Though the guest
speaker, Dan MulHolland, Liber-
tarian candidate for Congress in the
l8th District, expressed why he
thought the issue of abortion was
playing a ‘major role in this year's
political campaigns, both MulHol-.
land and the members of Pius pro-
life group seemed mainly concerned
with stressing to students the
dangers and moral repercussions of
taking the life of an unborn child.

Pitt Students for Life prefaced’

MulHolland's talk with a vivid pro-
life documentary entitled. “A Mat-
ter of Choice." The film made use of
real footage of abortion methods
and interviews with doctors and
supervisors of abortion clinics to
stress the pro-life concept of abor-

'tion as the murder of an already-

human fetus.

MulHolland continued the event
with an endorsement of the film and
a pre-life criticism of government
funding for abortions. “Government
has no role whatsoever in the fund-
ing. of an abortion,” stated the Liber-
tarian candidate. .

MulHolland stressed that the
Libertarian Party endorses a-hands-
off, passive policy toward all issues
from taxation to foreign affairs, but
no abortion, he said, “the Libertar-
ian Party is split.” .

Such a collection will allow the
paleontologists to study the anat-
omy of long-extinct animals.
According to Krishtalka, “Once you
know a lot more about their anat-
omy, you can reconstruct their evo-
lutionary relationships — who
might have given’ rise to.

“Another way of looking at it is to
study -community evolution. Fifty
million years ago, that area had a
community of mammalian herbi-

vores, carnivores, insectivores; how u

did they all combine to form an
interrelated community? How did
that community change through
time? - '
_ “You compare the fauna that we
find in 50-mil-lion-year-old rocks to
faunas that are older and younger to
see how the proportions of these
animals change through time. What
kind of changes in the environment
are causing these changes; for exam-
ple, 50 million years ago, that area
[Wind River basin] was not a desert,
it wasva lush subtropical forest filled
with streams and marshes.” ,

MulHolland was dismayed,“
mostly by the media's tendency to ’

issue. “I disagree fundamentally
with that," he said. “That doesn’t: .-
necessarily mean that it [ab'ortion]~ 
can't be‘ wrong in anotherisense.“ L 

MulHolland felt that the position
of the federal government since the
pro-choice Roe vs. Wade decision
by". the Supreme Court in I972, is", 
faulty in its inability to control all ff
but the method of abortion used in a_7 -
certain time periodlof pregnancy.‘i'"‘f
The federal government is also, he. 
said, actually encouraging inhu- V 
mane activity through its funding. 
MulHolland compared the abortion u .
issue with that of illicit drugs. He ' “
claimed that the government's con.-V _
cerns that a pro-life amendment will  
lead to an increase in the number of i ' ,2;

unwarranted. “There will always be  
some that break the law,” he stated. .T7:
“Most people will think that some- 
thing that is legal is good. Fifteen? 
million individual human beings are
not being permitted to live.”

“If a pro-life candidate enters the _.. .
presidential office in I985,” said .
MulHolland happily, “he’ll have the ,
opportunity to appoint fourjustices , "
to the Supreme Court.” MulHol- 
land stated that he felt something A’
had to be done on the federal level,’ ,
and criticized the Democratic Par-j, 
ty‘s distrust of the conservative
Christian candidate for‘_Supreme
Court appointment, Jerry Falwell.“
“This seems to be a theme running , _

Speaker talks sex

By Carrie Stetler
The Pitt News

You might call Ron Ralston a
love crusader. He travels to colleges
all over the country, giving such lec-
tures as “What 175,000 women want
in a man," “What 15,000 men want
in a woman,” and “Sex and the
Search for Intimacy."

Ralston arrived at Pitt last Tues-
day and gave his first lecture to the
residents of Holland Hall. On
Thursday night, he spoke to a siza-
ble gathering at the Student Union.
During both of the lectures he read
answers from a survey he conducted
on what women want in a love rela-
tionship. In his talk, Ralston
stressed “needs” and “communica-
tion" and explained the differences
between men and women. No, these
differences aren’t simply anatomi-
cal; women have different needs
than men and men have trouble
communicating.

.“Women are more person-
orientated and men are more perfor-
mance oriented,” Ralston said.
“Girls, have you ever been with a guy
and asked him this question: ‘What
are you thinking?’ and the guy says,

‘Well, I went to class today, I ate
lunch, I went to play ball and now
I'm here"?”

According to Ralston, men
develop their obsession with action
by playing with G.l. Joe dolls during
childhood. In adolesence, they fall
prey to the “James Bond syndrome.”
In this state, guys try to be utterly
cool and unemotional and need to
prove themselves by having sex.

Ralston painted a brief scenario
of a boy’s transformation from mor-
tal to 007. “A guy.sees one of these
movies,” Ralston said, “and one day
he looks at himselfin the mirror — it
usually happens while he’s shaving
— and thinks, ‘Hey —— James Bond.
I'm as cool as he is.’ Then he goes to
a party, his shirt unbuttoned to here
[Ralston points to his knees]. He’s
got this smile on his face, one eye-

brow is perpetually raised, some get.

it surgically lifted. He leans against
the wall, one hip out, and moves his
beer in a semi-circular motion.”
Girls, said Ralston, grow up
thinking that their Barbie dolls have
souls and spend time dressing them
and talking to them instead of send-
ing Barbie out on a cherry-bombing
mission. Incurable romantics, when

asked to describe their ideal date,
mentioned candlelight, wine and a
fireplace. “One girl says she wants a
little Johnny Mathis,” Ralston said.
“Now, I don’t know how far in the
background she wants him 
Ralston grew serious for a
moment to present some statistics
illustrating the gulf between men
and women. Ninety-three percent of
the women he interviewed said that
they had sex for loveywhile 84 per-
cent of the men surveyed said that
they had sex for pleasure or out of
curiosity. Once couples marry, the

divorce rate is 50 percent. “The big- ,

gest reason?” Ralston said, “self-
centercdness.” He then proposed a
game plan to help people overcome
egotism so that they could form
more satisfying relationships.

Although sex is one of Ralston’s
hottest topics, he also speaks on psy-
chology, philosophy and ethics.
“Students are most responsive to the
lectures on love and sex though,”
Ralston said. ” If I gave a lecture
about the existence of God, only
about three people would show up.
During college, most people are con-
cerned about falling in love or find-
ing a mate.”

Nuclear warfare,  
leadership dominate debate

Walter Mondale last night tried to
raise doubts about Ronald Reagan‘s
ability to command, while the presi-
dent said he dreams of the day when
nuclear weapons will be eliminated.

In the second and ﬁnal debate of
the presidential campaign, there was
not "as clear a winner as in the first
debate on domestic issues, where
Mondale was largely regarded as the
victor.

But the networks’ commentators,
in assessing the 90-minute debate in
Kansas City, predicted Reagan -
by returning to his homespun style
and avoiding details and figures —
would benefit more from the
confrontation.

In fielding a" question on the age
issue, Reagan unleashed what one
commentator later called a “brilliant
one-liner.”

Asked if he could get by on little
sleep, as President Kennedy did dur-
ing the Cuban Missile Crisis, Rea-
gan responded yes . and added:~ “I

‘ won’t make age an issue. I am not

going’ to exploit my opponent’s
youth and inexperience.”

It was the longest laugh of the
evening and Reagan took the time to
sip some water as even Mondale
smiled at the.quip.

In his rebuttal, Mondale said,
“No, I have not made it [age] an
issue nor should it be. But Harry
Truman said the ‘buck stops here,’ ”

Speaker

continued from page one .

When asked if this meant that he
supported the Republican Party,
MulHolla»nd stated that, “In a sense
‘that Reagan would be pro-life, he
would be better than Walter Mon-
dale. I don’t see it a possiblity that a
pro-life amendment would be

enacted, though. It’s very difficult.

for the Senate, especially, to take a
definite position.”

Mondale said, reiterating his
evening-long theme of a president
needing to be knowledgeable to be in
command.

Mondale said that since Reagan
took office, the escalation in the
arms race means “2,000 more war-
heads are pointed at us.”

In his concluding statement,
Mondale said 100 more warheads
have been built by both sides just
since the first presidential debate
two weeks ago.

Recalling the briefing he received-

the night before he became vice pres-
ident in I977, Mondale said he felt
the weight of possibly deciding the
fate of humankind at a moment’s
notice. “Pick a president who will
know what he must know if that
fateful day ever comes, because
there will not be time for‘ staff meet-

‘ ings or advisers . . . but pick a presi-

dent who will work to avoid that
day.”
I The one possible surprise of the
evening was that Mondale por-
trayed himself as the one who would
deal toughly with the Russians on
the arms issue while Reagan said
that if the United States developed a
“Star Wars” space-based technology
that would negate all
nuclear weapons, he would share it
with the Soviet" Union.

“Are we to believe that after ‘all
your tough stances about the Soviet

0PP0ses

MulHo1land showed his own
moral color, when one rather uncon-
vinced studenbquestioned MulHol-
land’s ﬁnancial argument‘ against
the funding of abortions by saying

that perhaps “more tax money

would have to be filtered to welfare _

to support children born to poor
families" if there were no freedom of
family planning. _Mu1Holland, who

Union?" asked one panelist.

“Why not?" Reagan said. “If we
came_up with a weapon that makes
the rest obsolete, the ultimate defen-
sive counterbalance, why not tell the
Russians sit down with us and get rid
of these nuclear weapons and we will
share this technology with you."

But Mondale rebutted, “I won't
share [that technology]  I would
not let the Soviets get their hands on
it ” '

‘ Reagan's sharpest attack came_

early on in the debate when he said

his opponent has “a record of weak- ~

ness when it comes to national
defense that is second to none." He
said Mondale has a commercial in
which he stands on a war ship look-
ing on at a squad of F-l4s taking off.

“But if he had had his way, he‘d

~-be deep in the water because he

voted against the Nimitz, against the
B-1 Bomber and against the F-14.”

Mondale said that when he made
that vote more than a dozen years
ago in the Senate, the F-14 deserved
to be delayed because “it was -not

flying right, it was a waste of.

money.

“I want a dollar spent to buy a
dollar of defense. Not spending $500
for a $5 hammer. Your [Reagan’s]
concept of defense is to throw dol-
lars at the Pentagon.”

abortion

opposes all taxation “which is
nothing more than legalized theft”

as he states in his campaign material,
ironically said that this money issue
was the “grizzliest of arguments

against a pro-life amendment. He

_ claimed that with such logic, one I

“might as well go out with a gun an

the editorial board. I

According to Ray Hiebert’s “The Press in Washington,”
Marvin Kalb, chief diplomatic correspondent for the NBC
News, once wrote, “Lying is a legitimate part of the defense
mechanism of the administration, and the reporter goes along
with it when, in his opinion, it is in the national interest.” For
Kalb, freedom of the press and the right toknow take a back
seat to national security. We should know by nowthe difficul-
ties of developing a consistent definition of national security.

Reagan employs a very broad interpretation of national
security and believes that much heavy equipment is needed to
protect it. What the president fails to acknowledge is the impor-
tance of maintaining freedom of information to ensure govern-
mental legitimacy. Rights of the free press and those of the
people using it are essential elements of a democratic govern-
ment responsible to the people. Once instruments of informa-
tion, like the free press, are manipulated or distorted to further
an administratrion’s views, that administration endangers the
national security by creating a climate of illegitimacy. If a given
regime or administration becomes illegitimate in the eyes of its
people,chances are that administration is soon to go, unless it
uses brute force to quiet dissenters. ' p

Not only can the administration in question lose its legiti-

A macy, but so can the fundamental system of governing which

existed for so long on the faith of the people to make it work.
When discussing natio.nﬂ2}Ls.ec.urity, we must not only give atten-
tion to weapons systems and perceived threats but also civil
liberties and the active maintenance of constitutional rights
and reponsibilities. The greater threat to U.S. national security
is the suspicion and distrust of the people toward their own

‘ government, ‘not a Soviet first strike.

Naturally, all of this is arguable. Certain things come to
mind, however, when one investigah.-s a few of the journalists
on last night’s debate panel. Georgie Ann Geyer, columnist for

United Press Syndicate, for example, is known to have worked ~

with the CIA in its attempts to overthrow Salvador Allende in
Chile and explained in her book “Who’s Who” that “the
Cubans‘ did not understand their own revolution." Marvin
Kalb’s compliance with administration Public Relations has
been well-documented in the case of the shooting of Pope John

Paul II, as he and other journalists provided “facts” on Agca’s -

connections with the KGB. Morton Kondracke, another pane-
list, is the executive director of “New Republic,” a popular
conservative publication. I

It appears that Reagan is attempting to get an edge on

Mondale not simply by better answering questions, but by

being asked better questions by more sympathetic questioners.
The wording of questions can, if posed accurately, reinforce the
‘expected answer.

in the second debate and its aftermath, it would be valuable
to think about who asked the ‘questions, how the questions
were presented and if the event was an unbiased presentation.
These debates are presented to inform the public, to encourage
citizens to vote and to react to issues. Unfortunately, the
nation’s highest office does not recognize the freedom of infor-
mation to hold priority over personal advantage. This is
politics. ‘

Letters to the Editor

“No Bus, No Fuss

(Editorﬁs note: This letter is the
second part of a column run in Fri-
day's Pitt News)

The bottom line is that despite all

V that has been tried over the years,

nothing can change the basic danger
inherent in the combination of

pedestrians of the university, the.

hospitals and the ﬁve lanes of traffic
with one counter-ﬂow lane for the
buses. Let’s look at everything that
has been tried.

At a recent meeting in Oakland,
recommendations were presented by

the Pittsburgh_Dept. of City Plan-.

ning, the Pittsburgh Dept. of Public
Works, the Department of Engi-
neering and Construction and the
Port Authority of Allegheny
County. Theproposals came rolling
like oranges: Post the buslane for 15
mph; painf 39 diamond buslane
emblems between Craft and Belle-
field; paint pedestrian warning signs
on the sidewalk, at curb — “look left
for buses”; post signs at the curbs, on
street-lights; establish a railing com-
mittee to recommend additional
railing locations. None of these
modifications to the buslane are new
ideas. All have been tried before,
and none have helped protect the
university's students.

Other proposals included: the
change of two bus routes to make
the traffic flow more evenly on
Forbes and Fifth; to change the
patient loading and access zones by
the hospitals and doctors’ offices; to
create new loading zones and
improve some of the existing areas
for access; to step up enforcement of
all signed traffic on the buslane, as
well as parking signs on Forbes; and
the enforcement of jaywalking fines.
Several roadway, traffic and pedes-
trian changes have been proposed,
including a traffic signal at Fifth and
Meyran with a pedestrian cross-
walk, repainting of center lines, no
turn-on-red signs, and altered traffic
signals.

The Port Authority offered mer-
chants a generous proposal to pro-
mote businesses and bus service, and
also planned was an evaluation of
the impact of all the recommenda-
tions on traffic, bus travel times,
pedestrian congestion, effectiveness
of safety improvements, and impact
of the number of people entering
selected stores on Forbes and Fifth.
But where does the safety of the uni-
versity’s students, or anyone walk-
ing on Fifth Avenue stand? Exactly
where it did last year and the year
before. it is simply in the nature of
the street to look only to the rightfor
traffic.» _ ~‘ ,. ’  » .

' v uslanes;are-riot-,_intand of them-

town do not create the same
problem. There, the way the street is
set up around traffic is problematic..
A buslane —— a highspeed lane -
going through ‘a community of
10,000 students, with our high per-
centage of elderly and handicapped
people becomes a senseless hazard
here. The special circumstances of a
lot of people crossing all day here
were neglected because, on paper,
there should not be a safety prob-
lem. Downtown does not have five
lanes of one-way traffic with one
counter-flow buslane. On Fifth
Avenue, anyone can forget the
counter-ﬂow buslane.

Fifth and Forbes are both state
roads under the maintenance of the
city. Any changes have to be coordi-
nated by a" tangled mess of interest
and committees, which can be easily
worked by those interested in keep-
ing the status quo. Even though the
university president wants to help,
he is forced to stand before all par-
ties with interests in our community,
all of whom profit nicely from the

university, and take -no action.

It is time to let the president know
we are behind him this time, 100
percent, because his is the only logi-
cal conclusion: The problem must be
removed, and it will take strong
action to do it. There is _agreement
now that if there were one more acci-
dent, nothing could save the _
buslane. ‘

Writeto President Posvar now,
and tell him of your support for the
removal of the busway. If only a few
hundred of the thousands reading
this write to the president and the
mayor, we will finally have the full
weight of the university brought to

_ bear.

1 read the letter to the editor con-

cerning WPTS (Oct. 12 issue) and it
just makes me sick. Everybody at

Pitt seems to be the same — apa- '

thetic. We as students are unique in a
strictly negative sense of speaking -

all we do is complain. If trouble
arises we cry and point our fingers
shiftingthe blame on all but our-
selves. If there is a problem, we
should stand up and do something
about it instead of just voicing our.
opinions in The Pitt News or spread-
ing gossip around campus. Students

at Pitt are just too submissive. We- .

want our way but only by having the
university bend over backwards in
order to appease us. Well, I say this
state of mind has to go!

If the student (name withheld)
who"wrote the WPTS article has a
grievance against the station, he
shouldn’t cry to the newspaper but
rather possibly join the staff at
WPTS. If he cares at all, he’ll' ﬁght
bureaucracy and red tape which may
be corrupting the university and try
to correct the problems.

So why don‘t we students unite
and put the University of Pittsburgh '
at the top of its class where it should
be? Well maybe it’s because we truly
are spineless, little degenerates who
really did come to Pitt because we
couldn’t get accepted to a “real" col-
lege. Wake up students! This school
is ours and if we don’t take pride in
it, nobody will!

Sen cilia letter  

The-Pitt News, Monday, October 22, 01098.4‘    

About Town/ by J. Stephen Lewis,

Those Who Could Vote But Didn’t

Today is Oct. 22. Election day will
be here before most Pitt students do
their next load of laundry, and
election-year ‘propaganda is ﬂying
like expletives in a shipyard. The
president has accused Walter Mon-
dale of spendthriftery and attempted

to portray him as a madman with a '

checkbook ready to write the coun-
try into a second Great Depression._
For his part, Mondale has accused
the president of over-cutting social
welfare programs and quite implic-
itly suggested that Reagan has as
much as ripped the food out of the
mouths of babes with one hand
while doing the same to the nation's
elderly with the other. Even the most
perfunctory examination of either_
candidate’s proposals for the future
of social programs, however, makes
the point moot; both the president
and Mondale propose relative aus-
terity for social programs for the
next four years, the only question
being not whether but by how much
to raise such funds provided. Inter-
estingly enough, though, each candi-
date also wishes to increase military
spending. ’

Military spending has been, since
the Eisenhower presidency, the
phantom of government spending.
Indeed, it was, even in 1960, enough

of a problem to compel Eisenhower
to warn future presidents against the
evils of the military-industrial com-
plex. Unfortunately, President
Eisenhower's warning went the way

of the hoola hoop and stocking sus- ‘

penders; private business/govern-
ment rip-offs have become as much
a part of the administration of
America as the Congress or the
Supreme Court, and the voting pub-
lic doesn’t seem to care.

When, on May IS, the Depart-
ment of Defense responded to Iowa
representative Berkly Bedell’s

~ request that itjustify paying $436 for

a $7 hammer, the public did not

respond (the Navy explained that is -

spends $429 on “administrative
expenses”). When the Defense
Department gave. the contract to
build DlVADs (tank.-mounted can-
nons) to the Ford Motor Company
rather than General, Dynamics,
although the Ford cannon hit only
nine out ‘of twenty targets as

opposed to General Dynamic’s can-
-non’s nineteen, and although the

system is more expensive and less.

efficient then the one it is to replace,
‘the public did not respond. I

When the Wall Street Journal.
certainly no enemy of big business or
the current administration, pub-

lished a series of articles detailing
how the Defense Department
spends over $200 for a $1.85 screw-
driver and $50 and upwards for such
items as screws, lug nuts and nails,
the public did not respond. .
\ When retired Admiral Richover
of the U.S. Navy wrote and pub-
lished a startling book, “No Holds
Barred," in which he explained that
the U.S. Navy intends to’ build sev-
eral times as many Trident subma-
rines as it can possibly use for any
practical purpose, and that the cost
of one-third of one Trident Subma-
rine is enough to clean the entire
nation's water supply,"the public did
not respond.

The public has thus far only
responded to more frivolous though
perhaps less frightening issue: Does
the president dye his hair? ls Walter
Mondale as exciting and gallant as
Ronald Reagan? Does the candidate
support abortion? Does the candi-
date wear a gray suit over and over

again, or does he switch colors

periodically? _

The results of this election will,
indeed,. say a great deal about the
American people and the worth of
freedom of choice, but not, perhaps,
what political analysts and we our-
selves might like to_ think.

(UPI) — A newspaper in Chico.
Calif., joined the growing list of
newspapers that have stopped pub-
lishing the Doonesbury comic strip.
On Saturday, an editor at the paper
described the Pulitzer-Prize winning
strip as a “hatchet job on the Presi-
dent.” He said the strip will not be
run again until after the elections.
Earlier this week, two West Virginia
papers dropped the comic strip, say-
ing it treated Reagan unfairly.

(UPI) — Marine algae found
along the California coast could be
beneficial for people suffering from
the pain of herpes. Organic chemist
Raphael Pappo said that the algae is
not a cure, but an extract from it
shows promise of relieving the
symptoms of herpes. Pappo said
initial tests indicate that one gram of
the extract taken daily as a food sup-
plement for several days has had
remarkable effects on even the most
extreme outbreaks. Pappo heads
research being conducted by the
U.S. Navy and the University of
California. Scientists warn that
extensive testing of the extract is still
needed.

(UPI) — Moscow has been
reportedly wooing the Arab leaders
of the troubled Middle East. And
one Islamic commander threatened
fresh violence in Lebanon against
the United States. Western diplo-
mats in Moscow said the Kremlin
appears to be trying to cash in on
rising Arab resentment of America’s
increasing support) for Israel. The
Soviets have been playing host to a
steady stream of Arab officials over
the last few weeks, and more are
expected to follow. The presidents
of Syria, Yemen and South Yemen
have all checked into Moscow,
along with the deputy prime minis-
ter of Iraq.

The Pitt News, Monday, October 22, 1984

Newsbriefs

(UPI) — Tens of thousands
marched in cities across West Ger-
many Saturday to protest the devel-
opment of U.S. missiles. Rallies
were held in Bonn, Hamburg and
Stuttgart, where the US. European
Command is headquartered. Many
of the protestors wore Reagan
masks and others carried signs read-
ing, “We will gladly sacriﬁce our-
selves for America.” Former West
German Chancellor Brandt and his
wife joined the human chain of pro-
testors near his home outside of
Bonn. In a speech, he told demon-
strators that funds being used for
nuclear weapons should instead be
sent to help Third World nations.

(UPI) — A former U.S. strategic
arms negotiator said that the con-
troversial Pershing II nuclear mis-
siles being deployed in Western
Europe are of no military use. Paul
Warnke said on West German tele-
vision yesterday that the purpose of
the hotly debated deployment was
purely political.
PITTSBURGH (UPI) —
Richard Henkel has been convicted
in a retrial of charges filed against
him stemming from a six-day hos-
tage siege and foiled escape attempt
at Western Penitentiary in Pitts-
burgh in April 1983.

The jury, which was selected in
Philadelphia, deliberated about
one hour and 15 minutes before
returning a guilty verdit on charges
of attempted murder, kidnapping,
making terroristic threats, assault
and attempted escape.

Henkel’s previous convicton in
February was overturned when it
was learned that the jury was given
prejudicial evidence.

Police said that Henkel and fel-
low inmate Louis Coviello held
prison guard Daniel Kohut and
prison employee Kostas Mastros

AMARILLO, Texas (UPI) -
Some parents have been set off by
Twisted Sister's “We're Not Going

Singer Daniel Snider was
charged with public lewdness in
Amarillo on Sunday night when
parents picking up their children
at the end of a Twisted Sister con-
cert complained that he was urging
a rebellion against parents,

Snider pleaded innocent, posted

in the ﬁeld. If the proposal is met
with approval, the scientists get the
research funds. However, there is
one more requirement: “The institu-
tion where the grant applicant works
[must be] a recognized institution
where the fossils will receive the care
and attention that is required.

“The fossils we collect belong to
the Museum of Natural History and,
since it was collected with govern-
ment moneys, technically they are
the property of the American
people.

“Carnegie Museum of Natural
History is a national resource and it
is its collection, in both fossils as well
as the recent animals, that makes us
a national resource. That’s what
good museums are all about."

The Carnegie Museum of Natural
History will benefit from the Wind
River Basin. “It is an important
addition to our collection of verte-
brate fossils. When some of these
fossils go on display, we benefit by
being able to serve the public better
in terms of providing knowledge of
natural history and, in this case,
knowledge of the life in the Ameri-
can West 50 million years ago. Plus,
our stature as a research institution
is increased.”

When asked why he chose paleon-
tology, Dr. Krishtalka said: ‘‘I was
always interested in zoology and
while I was majoring at the Univer-
sity of Alberta in Edmonton, I got a
summer job working for a paleon-
tologist, and I also took his courses.
The summerjob, collecting fossils —
dinosaurs and fossil mammals —
was very exciting. And for me
paleontology was the most challeng-
ing field in natural history. It's like a
detective story; you get a few clues,

The Pitt News, Monday, October 22, I984

Archaeologistmbr. Leona Kiishtalka.

A university group yesterday
distributed 1,000 signs through-
out campus aimed at making stu-
dents better aware ofthe perils of
the Fifth Avenue busway.

Printed in Pitt's colors of blue
and gold , the posters say “Watch
the Bus” and have an arrow
pointing to the left — the direc-
tion buses come from when trav-
eling in their exclusive lane on
Fifth Avenue.

Since the beginning of the
school year, two university stu-
dents have been struck in thebus
lane by Port Authority buses,
including one student who for a
period was listed in critical con-
dition at Presbyterian-
University Hospital. A third
student was also injured while
crossing Fifth Avenue, but not in
the bus lane.

The poster campaign was
undertaken by the freshman
council of the university’s Stu-
dent Government Board. A
spokesman for the group said
although the message is elemen-
tary, it is needed.

She said there are misuses of
the bus lane by some students

“Watch the bus”

who ride bikes or roller skate in
it. A Port Authority official who
spoke on a campus radio pro-
gram recently said he observed
one student who walked in the
bus lane reading a newspaper to
avoid a crowded sidewalk.

Even before the rash of acci-
dents on Fifth Avenue, city, uni-
versity and Oakland community
groups had begun meeting to dis-
cuss problems involving the bus
lane.

In one effort to improve.
safety, beginning Nov. I8 two
PAT bus routes will switch from
using the Fifth Avenue bus lane
to Forbes Avenue. The affected
routes are the 6lA East
Pittsburgh-Wilkinsburg and the
61B Braddock-Swissvale. That
will reduce the number of buses
in the lane from 514 daily to 401.

It will also please Forbes
Avenue merchants who say they
want an increase in bus commut-
er traffic because of lost sales
attributed to fewer pedestrians
on Forbes since the bus lane first
opened in 1980 after the city
reconstructed Fifth Avenue.

namely bones and teeth, and from
those you have to reconsruct the life
of the past as well as the evolution-
ary relationships.

“Paleontology is a discipline with
many tentacles that reach out to
other areas. It takes you into zool-
ogy, geology, astronomy, biome-
chanics, anthropology."

Astronomy at first doesn’t seem
related, but accordingto Krishtalka,
“One of the currently popular theor-
res on why the dinosaurs became
extinct 65 m‘illion'years ago is that
an asteroid hit the earth and
exploded. [It] sent a big dust cloud
into the sky which then enveloped
the entire earth, blocked out the
sun’s rays, created a greenhouse
effect, and killed off the dinosaurs.
To evaluate that hypothesis one
should know a bit of astronomy.”

Religion

By Ingrid §mith
The Pitt News

“There is a religious revival in
communist states
Europe," according to Dr. Dennison
Rusinow.

Dr. Rusinow spoke to a small
group of political scientists yester-
day in the Forbes Quadrangle about
the church-state relation_ships in
communistic countries. V -

Rusinow has written numerous
reports and articles on the church-
state relationships in central and
eastern Europe and is the author of
the widely acclaimed article, “The
Yugoslav Experiment.”

in Eastern‘

According to Rusinow, since
1950, communist governments have
been besieging the principles of
church and religion. They encour-
aged their citizens to be athiests or
agnostics and even go as far as
socially punishing citizens for affili-
ation with church and religion.

Poland, a communist state, has a
strong religious background.
Whether through inheritance or
strength, the government has been
forced to deal with it.

However, in Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia, the churches are
weak. Rusinow feels that since the
governments are unstable, they look
upon religion as a threat to the state.
This results in the communist’s war

in communist bloc

against religion.

“Monopoly in politics is some-
what similar to monopoly in eco-
nomics — it breeds rigidity”, said

Rusnow. “This in turn implements r

hostility towards religion.” As a
result, he says, the communist states
and the churches in these states are
left with few options. Either the
churches must continue to practice
their religions underground, or the
governments must open the doors to
accept religious views.

Dr. Rusinow has been reporting
for the Universities Field Staff Inter-
national from Zagreb, Belgrade and
Vienna since 1963. He is a Rhodes
scholar and holds a Ph.D. from
Oxford.

Also scoring for the Panthers  
were sophomore John Mooney,
who finished 28th, freshman Scott
Abel, who finished 32nd, and fresh-
man Joel Ninos, who finished 42nd.
Vasvary was pleased with the
overall effort and improvement of
his team, and said, “I told the team
after the meet to remember that
they're at young team and that the
entire team will be back next year
with maybe even some’improve-
ment. That includes a healthy Rod-
ney Giles, along with some incoming
recruits and more experience, which
will make us stronger and better.”
Vasvary was unsure if he was
going to enter his team in the NCAA

This past Saturday, the University
of Pittsburgh cross country team
finished sixth in the Big East Cham-
pionships. That in itself does not
seem like much, considering that
there are only nine teams running.
But considering that the past two
seasons the team finished eighth,

*""* that the Big East program predicted
them to be fighting with Seton Hall
for last place and that Pitt has a
considerably young team, this was
quite an accomplishment.

The team scored 163 points and

A “Pat

  Spikers invite  

The Pitt News, Monday, October 22, 1984 E‘   I

tournament

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
(I8-6) ﬁnished third in a field of four
by winning one of three matches at
its own invitational this weekend.
Inexperience, generated by a
depleted roster, and an emotional
letdown following a highly success-
ful tournament in New Orleans last
weekend contributed to the subpar

’ performance. The Spikers were
often forced to play with one senior,
one junior, two sophomores and two
freshmen.

However, the two teams Pitt lost
to have impressive credentials. York
(2-1) is ranked No. 3 nationally in
Canada and Providence is now 28-3
and in first place in the Big East with
a 9-1 record.

“After winning at LSU, we had a
real good feeling about our team,”
said head coach Shelton Collier.

;‘_'‘‘We still think we’re pretty good but

we relaxed some. In order for us to
be good we really have to fight
hard.”

v Pitt played York on Friday night
and appeared to have difficulty
returning spikes and serves, drop-
ping three straight games, 11-15, 6-
15, 8-15. York Coach Marv Mosher,
whose Canadian season does not
start until November and ends in
March, evaluated Pitt's perform-
- ance. I

Mosher said that he did not know
‘Pitt's Ulana Kohutiak too well,

“although she is a native of Ontario,
the province York is in. “She was ,

hitting fairly well and can obviously-
be very intimidating,” he
commented.

“The player who impressed me‘

was [Kris Wexell]. She had a good
attitude,” Mosher said. “Our. game
plan was, don’t hit to No. 10 [Wex-
ell] and hit opposite the side Ulana

,:”was on. Pitt’s weakness was in serve

' reception — their setter [Cathy
Rupp] was having to scramble all
over the place and turned some bad
passes into good sets.”

’ Rupp utilized many sets, includ-

' —ing jump, back, one-handed and

sliding sets, and scored several times
on dumps over the net. i
Pitt appeared to fall into a rut th
following morning when it faced
Cleveland State and lost the ﬁrst
game and was extremely far behind
 the second. “We played them
"pretty well after losing the first. We
fell behind 3-12 in the second and
came back towin it, 15-13, and then

won the next two to win the match.’’. 5

The abbreviated roster once again
became a factor in the Spikers’ loss
to defending Big East Champion
Providence Saturday night. Pitt has
been without the services of team

captain. and ‘senior setter Judy»

Young, _who contracted mononu-
cleosis threc weeks ago. Addition-
ally, senior Pat Belcher is again
experiencing problems with injury-
weakened knees and could not play.
normally plays very well

3 ‘E’-~’against Providence,” said Collier.

Kohutiak played at “70 percent,"
according to the coach, because of a
back injury sustained in Louisiana
last weekend. It seemed to lessen the

intensity and number of kills she '

unleashed. .
Pitt lost in an exciting seesaw

match that adhered to the pattern

that whoever scores first wins, and

that occurred in each of the five.

games. Pitt lost, 13-15, 15-8, 10-15,

 ,;,_15-4 and ‘8-15. In the first game, Pitt

“returned from a 2-10 deficit in an

impressive display of perserverance.
“Providence was an exciting spec-
tator match," Collier said. “Staying

close despite all our injuries indi-

cates that with a healthy roster we’ll
have a real good chance of beating
them. The best kind of match to see
is a five-game struggle [that lasted
over two hours], but that gives the
_ advantage to the team with a full
roster. We fought hard in spite of

that.
“It was‘ like getting a B on a test

“We knew they were going to
throw,” Dean added. “We knew they-
had to go to the air to score.”

"Whether they’ve had to or. not,
opposing teams find it most accom-
modating to infiltrate this once near-
impenetrable-Pitt defense to drive
downfield and score. Changes —— a
number of changes — have been
made to stop the ﬂogging.‘

Lewis and Tinsley both have rela-
tive experience but have failed dis-
mally in replacing the departed Hill.
Callahan began the year at free
safety, faring well after accruing
playing time last year. But he dis-
placed Smith at strong after Fazio
decided to give Wiley a shot at free.
Wiley, after missing classes last
week, didn’t make the Miami trip, so
Dean’s backup, Austin, moved in at
starter.

Nothing’s worked, only that quar-

terbacks know better than to look in

Dean’s direction.

“Don’t_ blame it on inexperience,’
Dean said. “lt’s hard to pinpoint it.
lt’s hard to say whatthe problems
are.”, 3

Defensive end Chris ‘Doleman, a

9

tri-captain when he’s not a surrogate -

father to fellow teammates,’wasted
no time. “There’s a lot ofyoung guys
and when you have young players
_you’ll get hesitation and mistakes.
I'm a defensive end, and if] have to
make a tackle in the secondary, I’ll
-make it. The same with Melvin if he
has to make one up front. You don’t
play as an individual.”
“You don’t want to expect [to play

I poorly], but you’re young,”said Cal-

lahan, who converted to safety after
‘being recruited as a fullback. “If we
had the answers and knew what to
correct, we’d correct it. You can’t
say this is why, that is why.”
Interestingly, several times
against Miami the secondary played
up to its billing of yore. At the start
of second quarter, after Shakespeare
beat Lewis on a 58-yard pass play,
Lewis bounced back, shoving half-
back Alonzo _Highsmith out, of
bounds at Pitt’s two before Greg
Cox mis_sed on afield goal try. Later

in the third quarter, Lewis blanketed _
Shakespeare in the endzone before ’

Highsm_ith picked up his second
touchdown run. ‘
The isolated incidents involving
the secondary paled in the presence
of Kosar.
In UM’s two losses this year to

rMichi‘gan and Florida State, he

threw six interceptions in the former
game while the Hurricanes scored
three points to" FSU’s 38.

When the Kommander loses, UM
loses — which hashappened only
three times since last year. “Bernie
showed a tremendous amount of
heart by playing on an ankle that
wasn’t 100 percent,” said Kosar’s
second coach in as “many years,
Jimmy Johnson. “He did just an
outstandingjob. What more can you
say about a guy who totally domi-
nates the football game?”

team wins

The Pitt Hockey team opened its
1984-85 season with a 6-2 victory
over Slippery Rock Saturday at th
Lakevue Ice Palace. '

The Panthers skated a strong first
period, taking a 3-1 lead into the first
ir‘ irmission, before adding one
second period goal and two in the
third. Their first win of the year,
which came after two exhibition

,.,_]osses last weekend, was no surprise
to Panther Coach Jim Owens. “We ,
should win a lot of games this year,” _

' Owens predicted. “We are heavily
favored to win the league. We have
won it five years in a row.”,

The team is primarily self-funded,
with the SGB paying for the ice ses-
sions. The players buy their own uni-
forms, sticks and pucks. Equipment
often runs over $300 per player.

Pitt is in a league with CMU,
Duquesne
McKeesport, and plays all_ home

ames at the Lakevue Arena near
" Butler. Their next game is on Sun-
day at home:

Volleyball team  
aced at Penn State

continued from page sixteen
Ulana Kohutiak, Pitt’s top spiker,
was less effective due to a nagging
back injury suffered in New Orleans

' last weekend. Collier said she played

at “70 percent -efficiency. She was
not as effective because ofthe injury,
but she really pushed hard and I
have to hand it to her."

The spikers will play at North
Allegheny High School tomorrow

night in a match against Ohio Uni-
versity, which Collier said holds a
two—fold significance for the team.
Ziener is familiar with many of the
teams members and the match is “a
homecoming of sorts” for Ziener. In
addition, Ohio University is the
school Rupp transferred from to
attend Pitt two years ago.

Ziener said that the match should

be fun but that she will be nervous."

Rupp is equally eager to play her
former teammates. “I am so pumped
up to play them. I can't wait to see
everybody,” she said. “I made the
right move coming to Pitt, and I
haven’t played against them since
I’ve been here. Last season, I was
hurt and couldn’t play, and I was‘
really disappointed. We’ll be ready

to play.”
