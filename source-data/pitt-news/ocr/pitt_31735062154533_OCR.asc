A committee of three to investi-

Vgate” conditions in the school cafe-
.ter1.a.V_.was appointed. by President

John Davis, Dent. ’29, under the in-
structions to recommend any im-
provements they see ﬁt.. Acting on
a motion for”such an investigatory
committee, introduced by Betty
Clark, Col.‘ ’29,. andgpassed by Coun-
cil, Davis appointed Gerald Woods,
Eng. ’30; Seibert Lynch, Bus..Ad.'

‘ Druids. Should‘ Be Tribunal’

- As an aid to discussion of regula-
tions,» Viers Adams, Col. ’30, chair-.
man of the freshman regulations.
committee, “suggested. that regula-
tions should be-adopted only_in case
that deferred rushing be-continued,
‘that, freshmen be requ.ired"to wear-
black ties and dinks,,and that the
Druids, with the aid of a. faculty ad-
_visor, should act as the enforcing
"body and as a tribunal to try regu-
lations infractions.

Asked by President Davis what.
method 1 the . committee had consid-
ered for compelling ﬁrst year men
to accept regulations, Adams said it
was not a matter of compulsion but"
of educating the freshmen to the
proper signiﬁcance of therules. He ..
said his committee had no solution’ ,
for the problem of the freshman, "
who consistently disobeyed rules, but
that they had several measures
under‘ consideration. '

Lindsey Questions Advisability

regulations ‘ struck a snag when p -
James, Lindsay,-.Bus....A_d... f3_0',...past._ .    .....;:;_.j,;.-
president. of the Druids," questioned "  
the advisability .of_ such a. scheme. V ~_ 
Instead, he suggested that’ agroup ;  
composed‘ of ‘several administrative- ' =. .1. 
heads and, activitypleaders would be A
preferable. Adams.replied that hav-__  .
ing;not only. sophomore Druids, but . V ;-ti‘
also junior. and senior Druids serv-—' '
ing on the. board, would “add to the
prestige of the Druids ‘and give them
something deﬁnite on the campus to
work for.” . _ '

Without further discussion the
tentative rules were referred back
to the committee, with instuctions

We are one of the ones who are

# if

for a theme a fundamental human.-

problem, at once intensely nation-
al and universal. A cross section,
of a. portion of the great‘Ameri-
can scene, something with exact
realities of time and place, is far
removed from ‘the Henchman. A
Jewish dreamer, a
daughter, wobblies, fruit dealers,-
anduwhitewings are not material

‘idiomatic, ~ structurally tight, there
are bound to be many pages neces-
sarily unconventional. To quote
Mr. Downes, “how will the libret-

I” was "thinking. that ' if my
mother had really. belonged,
‘to herself she wouldn't have
had to do whatshe did. And’
if my father had» really, be-

have, had -to" do what hedid
either. It was only because
they , were always needing
somebody else so much that it
happened —~ always depending
on somebody else for what they
ought to "have inside them-
selves. ‘

These ‘words-are obviously not for
musical investiture—moral precepts
seld-om yield inspiration to com-
posers. ‘

But despite Mr. Downes’ blue

freshmen still unaffiliated with any
fraternity who have passed the
scholastic requirements may be
rushed during this extendedperiod.

“As yet no deﬁnite date for the
rushing of freshmen who entered
in February is established, nor has
any deﬁnite time been appointed
for the pledging of men who failed
to earn the required 12 creditsand
12 quality points during the past
semester,” says Mr. Wilson.

During this -two-week period
contact between fraternity men
and new rushees is permissible; no
bids, however, may be submitted
until‘ the close of‘ the extended
rushing season. on Monday of next.
week.

Men officially pledged by frater-
nities during the recent rushing
period -are eligible for initiation’
into their respective fraternities
at any time during this semester,
Mr. Wilson says. . -

To The Editor-

MAKING A CORRECTION
To-the Editor of The Weekly:’

In theinterest of truth,*and in
justice to our opponents, will you
not publish this correction of the
widely circulated misstatements con-
cerning debate “victories” on our re-.
cent‘trips?' .1 

It is not true that we “won all
decisions." ’On the eastern triD'0n13’
eight debates were judged,»and- of
these eight decisions. our'team lost
three. The western team. lostgone
out.of four such decisions. 0

\Ve regret notonly that these mis-.

stateinents-" should have been pub-
lished, but also that the impression
should’ have been given) that de-
bating hereis conducted for .tlielpur-
pose of winning "v.ictories.” We do
not regard debating as a competitive
sport,‘ and we pi-efei-»NOT to have
debates judged. Where an impartial
audience expresses its opinion on the
question both before and after hear-
ing the debate, it is conceded "that
some signiﬁcance attaches to a de-
cided SI-IIFT of opinion one way or
the "other. , A

Such shifts, however, are not prop-
erly calledl decisions. During the
eastern trip, in’ the eighteen cases’
in whic_h such a shift of opinion was
measured it always favored our
team. Perhaps this’ is- the origin of
the unfortunate rumor that our
teams were "undefeated."
' ‘Will you, not cooperate with-us in
putting an end to this most em-
barrassing uiitruth? ’
W’. M. PARRISH.

Director “of Debating.

 

AIIIING MATTERS
To the Editor of The Weekly:

Now’ that I am no -longer‘ presi-
dent, of the Liberal Club" and my

opinions. cannot -be interpreted to. be I

those. of the club," I feel‘ as though.
I should like ,to’u,nb,urden myself of
a. few matters, that have prayed one
my‘ mind for some time". - ..

I should like, _ﬁrst‘of all,_ to ex-
cuse myself. for a. technical‘ error I
made_in reading in public whatljl

thought was a. public letter, having’

_wri_tt,en3.,-it myself to. Major I-Iorsfali,
head’ or-the, Pitt R. 0. '1'. c.,- which
letter invited, him -to. rebut John‘
Nevins Sayre, iiithe clatter’: Liberal
Club talk on “Militarisrn in Educa-
tion."' My error was‘ in assuming
the letter of suﬁlcient news value to

print in The Pitt ‘Weekly; and, a.p-_'

parently wrong: in that respect,‘ in,
reading the"1ettcr to , those who "at-

A'- tendedthe Sayremeeting. Somehow
or..' other, I haven’t'.a. guilty con-'

science for"- committing this technical
error. ’ .

Next, I'wish,‘with, all humbleness,
to take‘ Major I-Iorsfall to task‘ for
not beingfrespectful. enough to an-
swer my letter, and also for the tone
of his‘ conversation when_ I called
him by phonefor an answer. It was

in good faith that I sent the" letter .

in an effort to present both sides of
a controversial question, and done as
a result of advice and consent of
the Liberal. Club faculty advisory
committee. ' A11" in‘ all, I feel‘ that
Maj. Horsfall owes myself and the
Liberal Club atleast an explanation.

I also wish to condemn The Pitt
Vveekly for what I feel to have been
a perversion of its respons_ib_ility,. to
the student body, in faillng'.to're—
port news ofpinterest to the campus
in instances too numerous to men-
tion during this ,pa.ss'ing school year.
I grant the editors the right to de-
cide what is of news value, but when
the student body ‘must depend upon
city newspapers for news concerning
campus occurrences, then I feel that
The VVeekly has forfeited its right
to be called the "Official Student and
Alumni Journal of the University of
Pittsburgh.” , '

I should like to thank Dean Amos.
Miss
Heinz House who have been ex-
tremely kind and helpful in conduct-
ing our open meetings. Here, at

‘least, has been a redeeming ‘feature
of unpleaszmtries that have marked

my two terms as head of a campus
organization. .

twelve counters with ﬁve ﬁeld goals
and two free shots.
In the last game of the season
the frosh coach used ten men, sub-
' stituting at will. It was after W.
Kowallis ran wild in the ﬁrst half,
scoring nine points,_ that the coach
allowed his substitutes‘ to sift into
the-play. The second period ‘found
Brown, Wrobleski and Lawry in
scoring sprees,-and the team’s‘ac-
count for the half was eighteen
points. . .
- This year’s freshmen product
was one of the best to be turned
out on the stadium ﬂoor. From a

;list of. some ﬁfty odd candidates,“

George, Kowallis picked’ a team
which failed to ﬁnd its equal at an
point during the season. Although

thequintet met with three near-de- .

feats, last~minute attacks saved the
day in each case and as a result
the-frosh remai_n ‘undefeated after
a season of seventeen games. -

- Backed by the two younger Ko-
-wallis brothers, Stephen and Wil-

of whom are younger brothers of
former Pitt cage stars, the 1929

‘ Just one year ago this paper
carried the story of the elec-
.tion of Charles Jerry Wander-
lich to the captaincy of ‘the
Panther basketball team. -‘ Now
that the season is ‘over and
Captain Wlmderlich 18 the only
man who will not be. back next
year, it is interesting to note
. how far‘ Wunderliclfs predic-
tions werecarried out. ’

Wunderllch said: “We ought
to have a good"team;n_ext year.
I wouldn't just sayu ht now
whether we will win t em all
again,_»but‘I- hope so anyhow.
The schedule; will be tough and
Notre‘ Dame‘ as well as the
other victims-{will be laying for
'us next year.” " _

True to Wunderl1ch’s fore- .-
cast, Notre’ Dame, Northwest- ‘-
ern, Butler,‘ Wisconsin. and
~West.‘ -Virginia‘ trimmed: the
Panther‘ ﬂoor-men. He captained
a good team, one of the ‘best
in Pitt basketball history with
the exceptionof the 1928 team.
So ‘pre-season predictions do
mean. something, ‘after all.

winning‘ four straight games, and
are the favorites over the Gordons

- This fra will-conclude the Inde-
pendent cague basketeering. It
will be one of keen opposition on
both sides as both teams are primed

ticing on  the . Trees gym. ﬂoor.‘

The Ramblers have a singularly
impressive array in their linen . as
it includes Collins, Johnson, C ark,
Romig, Quatslei. Uansa, Peters,
Bornanavski and ‘Duncan, Most of
these men. are experienced basket-
ball players. of high school fame,
while one of them hails from the

campus was given the center last
week when Deana E. A. Holbrook
and Professor H. E. Dyche of the
school of engineering spoke here.
Dean Holbrook contrasted college
life in America and on the Euro-
pean‘ continent. Professor Dyche
spoke on electrical engineering. At

the close of the assemblyhour, en-'

gineering students remained" -to
meet the two men and hear a spe-
cial address by Dean Holbrook.

Show Photos

The library at" the Erie. Center
has been transformed into an art
gallery temporarily. Pictures. -on
display "are those which were taken
by Prof. William S. Maulsby of the
journalism department» of the ‘Uni-
versity, last fall. They represent
various student groups, such; as _stu-
dent council, council committees,
students at work in laboratories and
classrooms; and also groups of the
faculty and the Erie board of edu-
cation.

Second semester freshmen spent
the greater part of last week taking

placement tests: required; of all en-.

tering students. The regular school
routine was resumed Monday.

Chorus Girl aWi'—ites
Music For ‘Yip-Yip’

Singing and dancing to his own

musical, composition, “That’s Why
. I Love You,”, as a member of the

girls’ dancing chorus, Frederick
Schmadel Jr., Col. ’29, will pro-
vide one of the original features
of “Yip-Yip,” this yea_r’s' produc-
tion of the Cap and Gown.Club.

Schmadel, who was a./member ofi .

the girls’ chorus and: had a minor
speaking part. , in_ “Miss
quin,” the 1927 Cap and Gown
show, composed his number in re-

sponse to a call from Gus,A.'_Schna'-~

bel, musical,‘ director of the
and Gown, for student.
songs for “Yip-Yip.” . ,

According. to Schmadel, the mu-.
sic of “That’s Why I Love You”
represents the typical" conception
of the modern trend of music, its
novel swing and. appealing rhythm-
tending to- captivate the _ listeners.
The lyrics ‘of the song were also
written by him. He composed the
senior class song at Sacred Heart
High School, when he was; presi-
dent of the graduating class. ’

At Pitt Schmadell has been ac-
affairs since his
freshman year. He was accom-
panist of the Combined Musical
clubs in 1927, and is a memberfof
the‘ technical staff of Pitt Players,
of the Panther staff, of the Uni-
versity chorus, and of the Under-
graduate Cap and Gown Club. — He
belongs to Theta Kappa Nu, so-
cirl fraternity.

ILLITERACY PREVAILS
AMONG OUR STUDENTS

“There is more illiteracy on the
campus of any Pittsburgh college
than there is in a Tennessee moun-
tain county,” stated Dr. James
Stinchcomb, of the law department,
in an address entitled “Illiteracy
Among College Students?’ before the
Unitarian young people last Satur-
day at the First Unitarian Church.

Dr. Stinchcomb continued, “The
mountaineer reads: all that his men-
tal equipment and supply of'litera-
ture allow, which is more than the
average student does. No student
attains so higl. a degree of literary
eﬂiiciency unless he gives every
available hour to intelligently se-
lected lit-3'.'a.ture.”

.In the discussion which followed
Dr. Stinchcomb’s speech, he called
attention to the wide and intelligent
reading of technology students com-

Cap

pared with that of the others at the »

conference.

search. Similar specimens were
givengto the Pitt» department by
the county engineers last year
