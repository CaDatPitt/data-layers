Mathematician To Belabor

‘Objective’

Taylor Says “Practically

Test Methods

No J ustification Exists”

For Use Of “Normal Distribution Law”

By Roman Lapica
The true-false or objective test
takes another on the jaw today.
Dr. James S. Taylor, acting head of

the department of ii1atheina.t.ics, is re-'

sponsible.

Dl'._ Taylor is in Philadelphia in re-
sponse to an invitation to present a
critical evaluation of modern tenden-
cies in test procedures.

In an interview with The News, the
most Dr. Taylor was able to say for
the objective type test was:

“Maiiy such tests are not adequate
for the purposes they attempt to
serve.”

The professor agreed that ﬁll-iii,
matching and tru.e—false tests are
easier to grade, but he claimed many
“did not appear to test understanding
to any very Slgl1l‘llCallt degree.”

The professor's remedy—if adopted
~—nia.y bring grief to many students.
The proposal is none other than im-
provénient of‘ the-essay-type exam
rather than its abolition.

Another controversy was stirred up
wlieii Dr. Taylor touched the “normal
distribution curve problem.” He ex-
plained lie had been asked to evalu-

ate. from “the point of view of mathe-,

matical theory and statistical princi-
ples.”

He said, “I am forced to say there
appears to be practically no mathe-

matical jiist.iii(-atioii for the use of the
nornial distribution law in standard-
izing tests or distributing grades.
“And on the experimental side it
must be reported this type of distri-
bution is the exception rather than
the rule in the phenoinena of nature.”
- Dr. Taylor asserted the use of ,tlie
curve may be justified in the minds

of some on the ground of “social ex- -

pediency.”

(Joncerning objective type tests, the
professor said, “I feel that while for
certain purposes and in some ﬁelds
such tests have value, most such tests
are not adequate for the purposes
Lliey attempt to serve. 0

 C0111‘-‘Se such tests are much
easier to grade than essay type exam-
inal:ions,'but in  very large. number
of cases such tests do not appear to
test understanding to any very’ sig-
niﬁcant degree. .

“Also, while the grading of the pa-
pers in .-this type of test is objective,
the exuniination process as a whole is‘
decidedly subjective, the difference be-
ing that the subjective features enter
at an earlier stage of the process.”

'.l‘omorrow Dr. Taylor will address
the 22nd annual ineeting of School-
nieifs VV'eek nieetiiig jointly with the
Southeastern Conventioii dist1'ict of
the Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation.

Wholey Reviews
Personality Case

Psychology Forum Sees Pictures,
Hears Problem Of “Mrs. X”

 

Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll was quite a
well-balanced personality compared
to Mrs. X, whose case Dr. Cornelius
C. Viflioley, assistant professor of psy-
chiatry and‘ lecturer in DSYCl10l0gY.

presented before the psycllolosy
forum Monday afternoon.
Scheduled to speak on “SCl‘-i7-0-

phrenia and Manic Psychosis,” Dr.
Wholey changed his subject at the
last minute and reviewed instead the
case history of a “Multiple Person'-
alitv.” The talk was illustrated with
motion picti1i'es taken while the
patient manifested dissociated person-
ality states.

The patient, a young woman about
21 years old, displayed four distinct
personalities. In her primary state,
referred to‘ as Mrs. X., she appeared
normal, though irritable and hyper-
sensitive. Her “false” personalities,
through which she escaped from her
ordinary humdrum existence, includ-
ed such divergent characters as
“Susie,” a ﬂirtati.ons hoyden, “Jack,”
a. thoroughly masculine individual,
and “The Baby,” ‘in which she appear-
ed to have the nientality of a year old
child. ' I '

As “Susie,” the most fully develop-
ed of the sub-pei'sona1iti.es, the patient
was irresponsible and childish. She
did not talk, but wrote answers to
questions. In the “Jack” state she
brushed back her hair, assumed nias-
culine postures, and objected stren-
ously to her woman's clothes. In
both of those conditions she was an-
esthetic to a pin-prick, though Mrs.
X reacted, readily. ,

The most interesting of the states,
as shown in the ﬁlms, was “The
Baby” personality. In that state Mrs
X clapped her hands, played with a
ball, and learned to’ walk, watching
her feet as a year-old infant might
do. She passed from one personality
to another by swooning and emerging
a completely different individual.

“A multiple  personality,”.... Dr.
Wholey explained, “is a form of ma-
jor hysteria. It is a. protective state
in which parts of the “ego,” having
been lopped off the main personality,
dominate the individual's behavior
and enabled him to sidestep conﬂicts
with which his primary personality
was unable to cope."

Dixon Declares American Consumers
Prey To Misleading Ads, Bogus Claims

 

Byxlames Donoghue

100 million guinea pigs!

Kal1et’s phrase was applied ﬁgu-
ratively if not literally to the
great mass of American consumers
by Russell A, Dixon, instructor in
economics, in a talk before the YMCA
Moiiday freshman club.

Mr. Dixon spoke on “Getting your
moiiey’s worth.” Misleading adver-
tisements, bogiis claims of purity and
curative qualities, and downright
“chica.ner_v” cause the American peo-
ple each year to spend twice as much
money for various products as they
are really worth, he said.

As far as the general public is con-
cerned, Mr. Dixon thinks it is compos-
ed of unintelligent consumers.

“The public thinks that price is re-
1a.te.d to quality, that if you pay a lot
of money for something it’s bound to
be good,” he said. “This isn’t true,”
he contended, and went on to cite
a number of tests made of four promi-
nent makes of vacuum cleaners. In
efficiency, durability and economy,
the lowest priced cleaner ran a close
second to a medium priced cleaner,
whereas the highest priced cleaner

was shown to be practically worthless.
Zvlr, Dixon blamed the present sales
attitude of the nation in general, and
the trickery of the cleaner salesman
in particular.

The spx:-naker here branched off his
(ii;s(:llSSl(_)7,l to comment on The Pitt
News article about getting married
on $1._.500 a year. “You can double‘
your income,” he said, “if you marry
a girl who is a student and knows
wliat to buy and how much it’s
worth.

“lnt-::lligent consumption goes hand

he to expect in the nineteemh cent.ury criticism of institutions as institutions.
iitm-lyle, it is true, preac-hell the necessity of re1nodeledb’or new clothes for
nineteenth century institutional life; but not until our own time. when decay
[1233 bitten deep into the whole social order, has criticism of our basic ways
of thinking and acting become general.
~We do not need to turn for evidence to sociologists alone.

 

We can

“test our age for decadence ourselves by an examination of its institutions

and its expressions. If we generalize our reactions which we have to the

. literature of our own times, for instance, we can come to a certain under-

-standing of the collapse of our culture». We can see that men with the
Hkeenest minds have either bewailed the life we live today, or have tried
to escape from it, or have attempted to criticize it.

Of course, 11o.classiﬁcatio11 as neat as the one above can actually be
made. Each literary figure is made up of many elements. Gertrude Stein,

"for instance, occasionally bewails, now and then she criticizes, but in the

main she attempts to escape from a life so barren that it cannot excite either
her admiration or her disgust. Miss Stein has escaped into the realms of
technique. The abstract nature of words interests her more than the emo-
To words She implies more importance
than ‘she does to persons. She herself says that she sits up nights trying to
think out her primary reaction to words. We quickly dismiss her as silly,
‘£13 sensation-seeking", or as insane. We forget that an age other than our

But this woman who acknowledges herself to be a genius is not alone
in her insistence on the importance of tiny abstractions over the whole
field of human experience. Many writers join her in this belief. Tech-
nique for its own sake is the rallying cry of a great part of our literary
world. The French poet and critic, Paul Valery, himself one of the lovers
of words, suggests reasons for his attitude. He says that the world and
.life in the world are barren and inconsequential, and that reality and
significance can be found only by retiring into one’s own intellect and by
expanding petty personal problems into universal questions through the
medium of words.

But the literati have escaped more openly and boldly, Joseph He1'ge-
shimer, the color splasher. quite frankly picks out a spot sufficiently removed
by time or space from the present and proceeds to describe :3. life which
D. H. Lawrence, of a more realistic frame of mind,
flees to Mexico to see how more primitive persons meet the problems of life.
Our own Mr. Cabell escapes at the same time to realms of fantasy and word
wizardy. The life he sees about him is not worth the life of an imagined
world. Mr..Cabel1 is pleased to call himself the only civilized American.

Today the desire for escape has been carried so far that some authors
in an attempt ltovconvince the world that its symptoms indicate no mortal
over to a shameless and flimsy wish-fulfillment. The writings of such men
-of Joseph Hergesheimer. Behind those writings there is unconsciously the
‘attitude of the more thorough and. frank escapists, a despair and disillu-
sion with today.

But how do the men we call realists, the men who are dedicated to a
scientiﬁc examination of each aspect of our life today react toward their ma-
terial? Today the realists are all social critics. Theodore Dreiser and Sin-
clair Lewis are not given to a. fond admiration of the aspects of the life
they analyze. For some time they have assured us that each typical indi-

they know is harmful and oppressive. Yet, like the rest of the social critics,
they have not developed a complete view of their civilization. They describe
certain individuals, or the effects of certain institutions; they have not at-
tempted to bring together on a huge canvas the whole life of their times.
Their criticism is local, not universal.

It may be well to mention that most of the social critics live in Amer-
ica. a country not yet as thoroughly disillusioned as are the countries of
Europe. Galsworthy, almost the last prominent European social critic,
suggests by his gesture of despair in writing novels such as his last three
that social criticism, however, true, has been productive neither. of change
in society nor of a tonic view of life for the writer.

But others, however, who have not allowed themselves to be limited by
the use of the scientiﬁc microscope have attempted a world view. The re-
ports of their examinations have been unhappy. Without exception they
have found that the activities and emotions of people can bring only despair.

Proust fight madly against the aristocratic life he himself has known
in Paris; in the end he advocates evoking past memories as the only pleas-
ure in life.

' Huxley calmly dissects London life and discloses its dryness, its worth-
iessness. ‘

Joyce, writing about Dublin, can do nothing but despair.

Arnold Benntett, starting to write the life history of two sisters in “The
Old Wives’ Tale” ﬂoods his whole narrative in futility.

Even Willa Cather, in her description of the environment of Professor
Saint Peter and in her comparison of it with the more vital environment
of Tom Outland in his earlier years, implies the futility of struggling
against the oppressive life of today.

Some of these writers, in the expression of their deep-rooted despair,
attack the scientiﬁc view of re.-alism. The universe, they say, is not so well
ordered; it is not so simple. They throw up their hands not only at at-
tempts at understanding living persons, but at the examination of inanimate
objects.

Of the writers who have revealed the widespread poverty of our tradi-
tional existence, Thomas Mann is one of the very few who has retained a
sympathetic attitude toward mankind. The European society which he
criticizes he sees as a sanitarium, set off on the side of a mountain, very
much divorced from actual life. Yet Mann has not come forward to ex-
plain how those conditions which produce his despair are to be removed.
Bernard Shaw has viewed his society with some thoroughness; yet every
day he resorts more to banter and less to instruction.

_ These Writers of our own time have criticized society; they have found
it fruitless, oppressive, deadening. They have tried to escape it; they have
mourned over it. But they have found little to hearten them. They have
been unable to suggest what is to be done. They can diagnose; it is for us
to cure.

Comments Sundry That Concern The
Invitation To Protest Against War

By Edwin P. Banks ,

al invitation

Before zltxcepting
the honor, I shall
like a. couple of
observations about
the privilege:

In the first
place, 1 don't. care

strations, includ-
ing marriage cere-
monies, ‘com-
mencements, mur-
der trials, and ban-

Edwin Banks
voice their protest
some less dramatic fashion.

At the Sflllle time I have come to
the deﬁnite conclusion that the people

who enjoy watcliine; one of Mr.
Hearst's army manuever newsreels
cannot appreciate collegiate paciﬁc-
istic sentiment unless we, too, stoop
to the necessity of collectively cutting
a class and hold a peace assembly.
The day has not yet arrived when
we can all declare ourselves individ-
ually and reach a nation-wide audi-
ence. Vlfhile taking part in a mass
action may seem messy or in bad
taste to some of us, we must suppress
our emotions of shyness or reserve
for the sake of a. great cause.

I like Mr. Tibby’s direct appeal to
Pitt organiza'l:ions to act in this mitt-
ter. W'lir;-n only one group is forced
to take all the responsibility, it usual-
ly gets a bad name and is suspected of
the most amazing types of insidious
motives. Such was the case with the
early Christians. VVhen there is ma-
jority responsibility. however, profes-
sional labellers ﬁnd the nasty terms

If the YWCA, alone, for example,
stages a peace demonstration on
April 12, a certain downtown daily
will undoubtedly run another flam-

ing editorial. But if all our campus
organizations have the spirit and the
courage, and the latter is certainly
necessary, to show that college stu-
dents will not be led so meekly to
the next slaughter—then,-wonder of
wonders, we may possibly receive
the damnation of faint praise.

Vie have all heard the cynical com-
ments of the great minds about us who
are quite sure they know human na-
ture. Our elder brothers swallowed
the ballyhoo about the German atroc-
ities and saving the world for democ-

us, and wha.t.eve1' you may say to the
contrary, you’ll swallow similar bally—

Champions To Get

Winners Of Cage Tourney First
To Win Intramural Medals

Intramural champions at the Uni-
versity will receive distiiictive watch-
cliain awards. This "typically Pitt"
award was chosen over two stock
models by popular vote of the stu-
dents during the past week, ending
March 29.

ponents are unknown, the tournament

be pitted against some stiff opposition.
Navy, for one, will be represented
witli the possibility of Army also
competing in the matches.
Lieutenant Kleinman will take a
six-niaii squad on the trip to attempt
to show the service schools the proper
way to handle a riﬂe. Five of the
riﬂers who are certain to leave tomor-
row evening are Captain A. R. Davis,
A. T. Duff, J. C. Duff, J. L. Poellot, J".

For the sixth place, J. Robson and W‘.

Buhl Foundation
Supports State

Pennsy1vania’s Transportation,
Industry, Title Of Work
By Editor, Professor

 

 

Arthur Pound, associate editor of
the Atlantic Monthly, and Dr. E.
Douglas Branch, associate professor
of history at the University of Mon-
tana, are soon to write the history of
transportation and industry in ‘West-
ern. Pennsylvania, under the auspices
of the Buhl Foundation and the Uni-
versity.

Mr, Pound, the author of, “The
Penns of Pennsylvania,” “The Golden
Earth,” "Industrial America.” _ and
other books and magazine articles.
will write the history of industries.
Dr. Branch, author of “The Romance
of the American Frontier,” “Vv'est-
ward,” and other books, will cover
the transportation history.

These books will supplement the
program of historical writings now
being sponsored by the \Ne—stern_Penii-
sylvaiiia Historical Survey, which is
conducted under the auspices of the
Historical Society of Xvestern Penn-
sylvania aiid the University. ,

Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, in announcing the
University conception of the impor-
tance of these books, said: “In writ-
ing the history of early VVesterii
Pennsylvania, dealing primarily with
science and transportation, four things
stand out in my mind as important:
the culture of scientiﬁc advancement,
the advance of science growing out of
need, the increase in individualism
through the very nature of material
advancement, and the assimilation of
the old culture by the new.”

Concluding, Dr. Bowman said, “The
‘books are to be more than histories
of industrial technique and of trans-
portation, They are to be histories
of the human mind in \Vestern Penn-
sylvania ﬁnding its way tlirougli scien-
tiﬁc advance.”
