Interim chancellor foresees bright future for Pitt

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

When Mark Nordenberg
first told his father that he
was thinking about going into
law, after taking mostly math
and physics courses during
his early years in college, he
got absolutely no encourage-
ment. .

“He said, ‘Well, you better
have thought about all those
opportunities in math that
Nordenberg said. »

But Nordenberg pursued
his interest inlaw because
the field presented a unique
opportunity to study social
issues while interacting with
and helping people. It’s this
kind of interaction that

Tight bud

"ﬂy Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Both the University of
-Pittsburgh and the U.S.
Congress have asked students to
help them out of a tight situa-

- 11011.

Pitt has asked/students to pay
more tuition in order to relieve
the ﬁnancial burden caused by
decliningenrollment. And the
country’s deficit has caused

‘ Congressmen to consider cutting

studentaid, which would make
certain loans and grants more

and more elusive.

The scenario at Pitt is not
unique. Tuition costs nationwide
have soared above inﬂation
And, if the Senate
approves the same student aid
cutsthattheHousedidinJu1y, it
will aﬂ‘ect thousands of students

. across the country.

Many worry that this combi-
nation will work to make higher
education increasingly inacces-
sible to the lower and middle
classes, leaving this l1ighly-val-
ued commodity in the grasp of
only the wealthy who can pay
tuition costs, and of the few who

areluckyenoughtosoakupthe:

limited aid spared by Congress.

The United States Student '

Association (USSA) calls it “the
death of education.”

Nordenberg says he. has
enjoyed in his roles-at Pitt as
a teacher, interim provost,
law school dean, and now, as
interim chancellor. ’

In fact, his first two weeks

as interim chancellor entailed

mostly meeting with various
constituents in and out of the
university. ‘

On one particular day,
Nordenberg participated in a
lengthy meeting about the
university’s master space
plan — Pitt’s plans for con-
struction over the next 20
years — with governmental
and community groups. He
also met with the director of
the university’s center for
international studies to dis-
cuss ways to improve current
programs. And finally, he had

USSA has launched a cam-
paign to ﬁght proposed cuts to
grants and loans, such as the
Student State Incentive Grant
(SSIG) and the Perkins Loan,
which have both been -slated to
be eliminated completely. Other

tion with the senior vice

' chancellor for health sciences

about pressing issues, all
before 11:30 a.m.

“I think there are those who
might either hope or believe
that the daily life of a person
in a position like this would
be exciting,” he said. “I’m
not sure that it’s exciting in
the superficial sense, because
the activities do not vary dra-
matically from the activities
of people in lots of other jobs
— reading mail, dictating
responses,’ answering -the
telephone. V

“But if you like people, it
is the kind of job that pro-
vides the opportunity for
interaction with a broad
range of interesting people

for USSA‘. “It’s to symbolize

what will happen if these cuts go 9

through. It will be the death of
education for thousands and
thousands of students.”

Nordenberg came to Pitt 18
years ago and has made it the

home of his family, which

includes three children —
Erin, '21, Carl, 15, and
Michael, 12. He grew up in
Duluth, Minn., but moved to
Pittsburgh in 1965 where he
graduated from North

Allegheny High School and t_

Thiel College in Mercer
County.
He practiced law in

Minneapolis for two years
and worked as an assistant
professor at Capital
University before coming to
Pitt. *

Nordenberg came to Pitt in
1977. He served as law
school dean from 1985 to
1993 and served as interim
provost from. September 1993
through June 1994.

In his first role, as a profes-
sor, Nordenberg says one of
the highlights was being able
to help and direct students.
And few things are more
rewarding, he says, than
hearing from former students
who say they took from his
classes valuable lessons. _

Some have even sent con-
gratulations cards after

sources of aid in danger of being
cut are the Pell Grant and certain
aspects of the Stafford Loan,
such as the six-month grace
period given to students between
graduation and the" time they
have to start paying back the
loan, and there has even been
talk of eliminating Stafford
Loans for graduate students.
“We’re calling it the death of
education campaign,” said

America has surfaced, many
have protested how the aggres-
sive budget-cutting outlined in
the contract will affect what_they
view as necessary programs.
Mclntosh says she’s sympathetic
to the need to cut the deﬁcit, but

she calls the cuts to student aid _
_ “inesponsible deﬁcit-reduction.”

“It’s putting [the deficit] on

‘the backs of students,” McIntosh
"said. “Students are very much

~

of so many.

Another trend that troubles
many students is the shift in the
grant-to-loan balance. In 1975-
76, federal grants constituted 76
percent of financial aid to stu-
dents. In 1993-94, grants made
up only 22 percent of ﬁnancial
aid, forcing many more students
to take out loans to ﬁnance their
education.

. The proposal to eliminate the

gets threaten future of higher educcttioni

six-month grace period on the
repayment of the Stafford Loan
was approved by the House.
Appropriations Committee in
July. This proposal and others,
like one to eliminate the interest-
subsidy on the Stafford Loan,
will go to the Senate in
September. The interest—subsidy
is one type of loan where the
government pays the interest on
the loan while the student ﬁnish-
es school,

The USSA has also targeted a
proposed change made to the
Pell Grant program.

“[The House Appropriations
Committee] suggested increas-
ing the m_aximum grant [by
$100] to $2440, but this comes
at the same time that they
increased the minimum,”
McInt_osh said. “That cuts off
nearly a quarter million students
that would be eligible for th
Pell Grant.” ‘

“Those are “students that really
need funds.”

Disputes about priorities and
lack of funds have saturated

campus affairs during the past"

year at Pitt.
But the attention that ﬁnancial
affairs receive does not mean

Board of

Trustees

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief ‘

A retired vice president of ad

ketchup company, a president
of an agricultural school in
Florida, a medical lieutenant in
the Navy and the CEO of one
of the biggest airlines in the
country all have something in
common that plays a bigger
role in your life than you prob-
ably imagine. -

They are all members of
Pitt’s board of trustees, a group
that hires and ﬁres the chancel-
lor, decides tuition rates and
sets the mission of the univer-
sity, among other duties.

Collectively the most power- V

ful group at Pitt, the individu-

’als of the board also wield

major influence in politics and
business of Western
Pennsylvania. Seth Schofield,
for instance, is the CEO of
USAir, the airline that is
responsible for about 90 per-
cent of the trafﬁc at Pittsburgh

Cal 4 _

International Airport, or J .W.
Connoly, the chairman of the
board who was the former
head of the H.J. Heinz compa-
ny. .
Along with powerful busi-
nessmen, the board has some
trustees who come from_far
away, such as Fredrick
Humphries, the president of

the Florida Agricultural and ’

Mechanical University in
Tallahassee, Fla. ’
With the power the board of
trustees has generated comes
inevitable power struggles,
like the one that lasted for four
years between _ former
Chancellor J. Dennis O’
Connor and some high-ranking
members of the board who had
lost conﬁdence in the universi-
ty president. O’Connor
resigned last April, and
although many ‘board members
were dissatisfied with his
tenure, he was given a lucra-
tive offer to stay at Pitt and

teach biology.

4“I wish I had sought the con-
ﬁdence of the board of trustees
more then I did,” O’Connor
said in an interview with The
Pitt News last May when
reﬂecting on his term as chan-
cellor.

O’Connor remained silent
for a few months on why he
resigned, but at the board’s
semi-annual meeting last June,

. BQAKD OF TRUSTEES
C): W. Carma” 

he blasted the trustees.

“Don’t misread my succes-
sor the way you misread me,”
O’Connor said at the meeting.

He_ urged the board to avoid
the turmoil it created for him
by giving the next chancellor a
set of goals and a mission to
lead the university.

Not every board member
wanted to see O’Connor
resign.

Former board chairperson
Farrell Rubenstein was in
charge of the committee that
landed O’Connor at Pitt.
Rubenstein gave a passionate
speech defending the exit
package O’Connor received
when he left Pitt.

But battles for power aside,
the board of trustees at Pitt is a
complex, bureaucratic organi-
zation that includes the mayor
of Pittsburgh and the governor
of Pennsylvania as non-votin
members. ’

There are 36 voting mem-
bers on the board and, along
with the chancellor, they are
divided into four groups —-
Commonwealth, Charter, Term
and Alumni. There are also 14
special trustees who are not
allowed to vote but have all
other rights given to a board
member. Another section of
the board is the emeritus
trustees, of whom there is not
a set number. They are, “any

     
 
 

SENIOK V.“ Foﬂ
BUQNE55

    
  

person who has served as a
trustee of the university and
who is considered worthy of
special honor,” according to
the «board’s bylaws.

Charter and Term Trustees
can get on the board after
being elected by current board
members. They can get them-
selves into a position to be
elected by being nominated by
the nominating committee.

Alumni trustees get on the
board by being elected by
Pitt’s Alumni Association,
while Commonwealth Trustees
are appointed by three differ-
ent individuals in the state
government —— the governor,
the Senate president pro-tem-
pore and the speaker of the
General Assembly. "

The individuals on the cur-
rent board, and of past boards,
make up a small who's who
list of Pittsburgh, such as
Pittsburgh-born playwright
August Wilson, who wrote the
award-winning “Two Trains
Running” and “Ma Rainey’s
Black Bottom.”

Eight trustees were listed in
the Pittsburgh Business Times’
most recent Highest-Paid
Executives in Pittsburgh list,
including four in the top~l5.
Anthony O’Reilly, an Emeritus
Trustee, placed fourth on the
list with an annual salary of

$1.9 million. O’Reilly is the.

A-5

Pil-I lrusiees make ketchup and flyplunes

chairman, president and CEO‘

of the H.J. Heinz Company.
Also on the list, hauling in
over $1.2 million a year, were
Frank Cahouet and Thomas
O’Brien, the heads of two of
the leading banks in
Pittsburgh, Mellon Bank and
PNC Bank. .

Along with leading business-

men, the board has some -

heavy political players.

Mike Fischer (R-Allegheny)
is the majority whip in the
State Senate and made a run
for the gubernatorial office of
Pennsylvania last year. His
adversary in the Senate,
Democrat Mike Dawida, is
also is a trustee. Dawida
recently ended the Tom
Foerster regime in Allegheny
County by winning‘ the
Democratic primary for county
commissioner. '

In more local politics the
board is represented by the
Allegheny County controller,
Frank Lucchino, and an asso-
ciate justice of the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania in

' Pittsburgh, Justice Ralph

Cappy.
The board usually has two

full meetings a year in addition
to 15 various committees that
meet throughout the y_ear'on
topics such as ﬁnance, athlet-
ics and affirmative action.

Pitt police takes student safetyseriously

By Jackie Duggan
Asst.gNews Editor

Being safe on campus is a

‘serious topic that freshmen

and even the most seasoned
Pitt student can easily forget.
For_freshmen, the excite-

.ment of campus life away

from restrictingparents opens
the door to many unexpected
problems. For more experi-
enced students, the familiarity
of the campus routine often
lures students into letting

‘ their guard down.

You may be tempted to
ignore these tips if you have
heard them all before. But
when was the last time you

' actuallyipracticed being safe

on campus? Will you think
about being safe before you
go. to your first fraternity

.party, or as your walk around

campus at night?

The most important thing to
keep in mind about campus
safety is using common

sense. As you leave a party in’

the Oakland ‘area, remember,

you are not in a comfortable

_ suburban neighborhood.

To protect yourself from
attack, it is important to go
with someone and to stay
away from isolated areas.
North and South Oakland are
full of alleys, parks and park-
ing lots that may seem like
easy shortcuts. These areas
are generally not well-lit and
often create an opportunity
for you to be attacked.

If you are being followed,
you and your partner should
change direction or cross the
street. You should keep look-
ing back so the person knows
you are aware of their pres-
ence and can’t be surprised.
Go to a store, residence hall
or any area where there are

other people, and most impor- —

tantly, stick with your partner

— there is safety in numbers.
Despite taking these safety

precautions, the possibility of

being held up can not be
ruled out. If you are being

"mugged, it is best not to
resist. No amount of money‘

or jewelry is worth taking
chances with your life. Try to
remain calm and cooperative.
If a robber is armed, it is best
to go along with what they
demand. '
What you can do is notice
and remember every detail
about the assailant. Age,
height, weight and any dis-
tinctive characteristics such
as tattoos, clothing, scars or
jewelry are very useful to

report to the police.

Also, it is important to noti-
fy campus authorities imme-
diately after an incident or if
you feel unsafe. Pitt Police
are trained professionals who
want to help to ensure student
safety.

Sometimes, no matter how
cautious we are, there is no
protection from a violent
crime. On July 13, 1995, Pitt

student Kevin Cecil was
escorting a female friend
back to her apartment and
was shot in the back of the
head. Cecil will likely be par-
alyzed for life.

While this sort of incident
does not usually happen on
the Pitt campus, it is a crude
reminder of the randomness
of some violent acts and why
these safety precautions are
so essential.

Students should also be
aware of safety facilities

Alcohol took the life of a
Pitt student celebrating his’
21st birthday last year, caus-
ing university administrators
to become more aggressive
in their battle against abuse
of alcohol on and off cam-
pus.

“We must_ make students
aware of_ the dangers of
excessive alcohol abuse,”
said Pitt Vice Chancellor for
Student and Public Affairs
Leon Haley.

After the death of Attif
Bhatti, a Pitt senior, Haley
formed an alcohol abuse
task force chaired by the
director of the counseling
center, Bob Gallagher. The

On November 5, 1895,

‘ teenager Ralph Taylor

squeezed through the legs
of a man in a 300-person
line and raced to become
the first customer of the
Carnegie Library.

Ironically, when
Andrew Carnegie was a
boy, he was refused ser-
vice at a library. Only
after an appeal to the
library owner was he
allowed to use the facili-
ty.

This year, The
Carnegie complex in
Oakland celebrates 100
years of service to

_ Pittsburgh. It stands to

ensure that what hap-
pened to young Carnegie
will never happen again.
The Scottish steel mag-
nate Carnegie donated

.millions to establish free

public libraries all over

the world. Hailing from
Pittsburgh, Carnegie saw
the need-for working-
class people to have free
resources to further their
education.

The main entrance of

the library in Oakland.
simply states Carnegie’s‘

goal: “Free to the
People.”
By , donating

0 $1,000,000 dollars with

the stipulation that the
city of Pittsburgh would
appropriate $40,000
annually for its mainte-

nance, Carnegie secured ‘

his plan for a free library.
Now as_a permanent
fixture in Pittsburgh his-
tory, the Carnegie facility
encompasses a museum
of art, a museum of nat-
ural history and the
library. All facilities are
world renowned.
Beginning Sept. 16,
The Carnegie will cele-
brate its centennial with a

“World’s Largest Open

Oakland complex, "the
Warhol Museum and the
Carnegie Science Center
will be open free to the
public for a 24-hour"
“marathon.”

Ellsworth Brown, pres-
ident of the Carnegie
Institute and the Carnegie

Public Library, wants
Pittsburghers to under-
stand the positive impact
the centennial celebration
will give the city.

“The Carnegie
Centennial is a lever to
activate increased sharing
of the wonderful ongoing.
outreach programs of our
museums ‘and libraries,

so everyone has access to '

tional and entertaining

was designated as the Regional
Resource Center for Science and‘
Technology because of the
strength of its collection, making
the it one of four libraries in
Pennsylvania to hold this hon-
ored designation.

Publications from NASA and
the Department of Defense can
be found in this department, as it
is also carries the additional des-
ignation as Regional Technical
Report Center.

In addition to his resolve to
educate the people, Andrew
Carnegie was also remembered
for having a love of music. He
once said this began as a child
listening to his father singing
Scottish songs. .

In .1895, the library started
with a collection of 2,000 vol-
umes on music. Today it has
grown to over 100,000 reference
and circulating books and scores

. as well as LPs and compact
4 discs.

The collection of scores
includes the earliest known sam-
ple of Johann Sebastian Bach's
handwriting, which is a manu-
script he copied as a youth.

“The Carnegie music depart-
ment is one of the best public

resources in the country. It’s out- .

standing,” said Robert Lord, a
Pitt music professor and per-
forming organist.

Since 1928, the Pemrsylvania

' department has been a valuable

resource for all aspects of local

. history. Over 30,000 pictures of
' famous Pennsylvanians and
 events are housed here as well as

every Pittsburgh obituary in the
last two centuries.

Audrey Iacone, librarian in the
Pennsylvania department, said
that this department is not only

. excellent for Pennsylvania histo-

ry, but also for individual family
history.

“People can come here to
research their heraldry, or family

crests. We also have a large ».

. genealogy section for those who
. want to find out about their

ancestors,” said Iacone.

Iacone also said that the
Pennsylvania department has a
complete listing of all

I Pennsylvania political officials

and their addresses.

The Leonard C. Staisey
Library for the Blind allows
handicapped people to enjoy the
benefits of the library. The inclu-
sion of this department gives
credit to Carnegie’s idea that
everyone should have access to
educate themselves.

Since most patrons of this
department are unable to browse
for books, they register for a free
service that enables them to
receive recorded and braille pub-
lications. ’

In 1901, the ﬁrst ever Training
School for Children’s Librarians
opened at the Carnegie. This.
school trained librarians to work

. with children and to understand

children’s literature.
This school eventually became

the University of Pittsburgh’s _

School of Library Science.

The Fall Festival of Children’s
Books began in 1964, and it
brings famous writers of chil-,
dren’s literature to Pittsburgh.

Although college students
claim to be poor and starv-
ing, many do have a lot of
expensive valuables that are
very attractive to robbers.
The best advice is to keep
an itemized list including ser-
ial numbers of major pur-
chases. You should keep your
apartment or dorm room

locked at all times, and never,

leave valuables (including
’ books and bookbags)'un'at-
tended when studying. Buy a .

good lock for your bike, and
always double check to ‘make
sure you lock it securely. It is
also best to register your bike

.with Pitt Police so they have .

your serial number and regis-
tration number in their
records.

Once you are in your room
or apartment, it does not nec-
essarily mean you are safe.
Students must be cautious of

' open windows and doors at

all times. Just last month
Carnegie Mellon University

‘security was beefed up

because of a series of rob-
beries and rapes which
occurred near the CMU cam-
pus. In all instances, the
rapist or robber entered

through the first floor win-, ; ‘
dow of the victim’s apart- ,

ment.

Nordenberg     

°From page A-4
Nordenberg’s appointment as

1 .i'n‘terim‘ chancellor, though

not all of them with-the con-

ventional c_ongratulat»io‘ns

message. A ’ .
“I’ve gotten all kinds of

letters of congratulations-,”:_he
s"aid..“Somctimes with the»

message. ‘We wish _you
.Weren’t doing thi's.-°'.We1.,»think
you should be"‘i'n th'eVclass-
room —— that’s where’ you
really belong.”

But Nordenberg.’s commit-

ment to and the feelings he i
g -has for the university encom-

pass his desire to help stu-
dents move ahead. During
‘the firsttwoweeks of his
new position, he found the
time to set up a meeting

_ The-Pitt News, M_onda—y,-_:August 28, 1995

we owe toour students really
could not take a second seat
to anything else.”

Some V priorities of the
office that Nordenberg said
he plans to maintain are cur-
ricular innovations within the

, College of Arts and ‘Sciences,

classroom renovations, pro-
viding the kinds of technolo-
gy students need tobe able to
use today and holding the
quality of teaching to a high

. standard when making pro-

moti.on and tenure decisions.
But chief among chal-
lenges that face the universi-
ty today is the pressure that
economics seems to push

‘against efforts to_ move,

ahead.-

stronger ten years down the
road than we are today.
“We’ve got to re-examine
how it is we are investing our
time, our money‘ and our
other resources and ask our-
selves whether all of -those
things are actually better than
things’ we might be doing. If

the answer is no, -then we»

need begin‘, to make
changes.”_

Not only does Nordenberg
believe in this kind of institu-
tional introspection, but he
said Pitt should also examine
ways to engage in partner-
ships with other universities.

Recently, Nordenberg spent
about two-and-a-half hours at
Carnegie Mellon University
discussing a partnership

with a student he met
while he served as inter-
im provost. The student
was interested in law‘
sc_hool.a_nd wanted-to
talk about it with
Nordenberg. ,
“These are the kinds

me to an academic posi-
tion in the first place,”
he said. “When you
come away with the

ly helped another person

that Pitt and CMU have
formed to create a center
for neurobasis cognition,
a project largely support-
ed by a multimillion dol-
lar grant from the R.K.
Mellon Foundation.

‘ .’.‘i‘What it says in the
most basic terms_'is, the
way the brain works is
one of the most impor-
tant frontiers of knowl-
edge. And if you look at
Pitt, and you look at
CMU, either of them

move in a direction that
he or she wanted to move —
what can be more satisfying
than that?” ‘ ' 7

Nordenberg says he hopes
to inject this attitude into his
office, a feeling that is also
exhibited in a statement
made by Pitt’s founder, Hugh
Henry Brackenridge:
“Whereas the education of
youth ought to be a primary
object with every govern-
ment, that we ought to have
this institution...”

“And I really always have
thought," Nordenberg said,
"that even in a research insti-
tution, which has a broad
range of important missions,
that education is really the
most fundamental mission
and that the obligation that

“There just doesn’t seem to
be the money to spread

around today that there once

was, whether you’re talking

about support for education ~

or whether you’re talking
about salaries with law firms.
So that is a challenge.”

But Nordenberg said he
believes Pitt is making‘nec-
essary adjustments, such as
formulating the master space

' plan and the long-range acad-

emic plan, to feed the hope
of becoming a stronger insti-
tution.

“The planning process that

is underway on campus is,

though sometimes a painful
exercise, exactly the kind of
thing that we’ve got to be

doing if we want to be

standing individually has
people who can make unique
contributions to our under-
standing of the processes of
thought and thinking.” _
When the complementary
strengths of the two campus-
es come together, “you have
within a few blocks of each
other a combination that can-
not be equalled any place,”
Nordenberg said. \
Innovations in Pitt’s med-
ical school, as well as’ the

Equality of its neuroscience

and psychology departments
can benefit the center. And
CMU can add its pioneering
work in artificial intelligence
and computer science.
“Here’s an opportunity for
us to do something that can
really make a difference that
we could not do standing
alone as institutions,”

1 Nordenberg said. “And that’s

the kind of thing that we sim-

' ply have to do more of in the

future.”

Consider the purchase of a per-
sonal alarm device such as
those sold in the University
Book Center.

4. c. Don’t hesitate to call the
police. If you are victimized or
a witness to a crime or merely
observe something suspicious,
call the police immediately.’
They can typically respond to
your call in a matter of minutes.

5. a. Be rational even when
others are not. Try to remain
calm if challenged by persons
who are intoxicated by drugs or
alcohol. Don’t allow yourself to
be baited into trading insults or
threats with drunks.

6. b. Take full advantage of
the shuttle system and Van
Call. These services exist for
your convenience and safety
and can provide ready trans-
portation throughout the imme-
diate area nearly 20 hours a
day. a

7.oa. Stay in the brightly-lit
sections at night. If you’re
going to walk, follow those cor-
ridors which offer the advan-
tage of illumination and com-
fort of having other people

8. c. Take care of your
friends. Plan activities together,
look out for one another and
don’t allow yourselves to be
separated at parties. Let your
friends know when you’re
going to be gone and where you
can be reached.

9. b. Protect your’ property.
Keep your room locked at all
times. Don’t leave valuables
(including books and book-
bags) unattended when study-
ing. Buy a good lock for your
bicycle — don’t use cable or
combination locks. Place
expensive car equipment (stere-
os, CD players, mobile phones)
in the trunk of the car whenever
possible. Always keep an item-
ized list including serial num-
bers of major purchases.

10. b. Be part of the solution,
not part of the problem. Take
pride in your university com-
munity. Be respectful of your
neighbors and all the people
who are working hard to make
Oakland a great place to be.
You are much more than just a
visitor here —— this is your
home and it deserves special
treatment. Do not bring danger-
ous weapons on campus, be
mindful of our state laws and
finally, don’t forget to enjoy
yourself.

impending disaster. It simply
helps the university to control
costs, said the associate vice
chancellor for budget and
ﬁnance, Art Ramicone.

"A lot of attention was paid to
our ﬁnances by the board and by
the provost, so I think that we're

certainly headedlin the right"

direction," Ramicone said. ‘

"Sure, we're concemed about
controlling costs and seeking out
additional sources of revenue,
[but] you're not going to walk in
here one day and ﬁndthat we've
gone bankrupt or don't have the

_ money to turn on the lights." -

But both faculty members and
students will have to make sacri-
ﬁces in the university's quest to
control costs. ‘

The University Planning and
Budgeting Committee found a
way to pull the reins in on
spending by voting to freeze hir-
ing and salary increases for the
ﬁscal year 1996.

“They realized early on it was
going to be a tough year,”
Ramicone said.

Then tuition increased. When
enrollment ﬁgures came in, _the
numbers were less than what
had been projected, leaving Pitt
with about a $5 million shortfall.
To compensate, a 4.5 percent
tuition increase was approved
by the board of trustees in June
and goes into effect this semes-
ter.

“One of our major sources of
revenue is tuition revenue,” he
said. “When the actual enroll-

. ment ﬁgures came in, they were
less than we had anticipa .”

has decreased from 34, 514 to
32,519, a difference of about
2,000. For the ﬁscal year 1995,
$204,708,000 fed Pitt's total
budget of $808.9 million,
accounting for about 25 percent
of the budget.

The operating budget is divid-
ed into two categories of funds
—— restricted and unrestricted.
The restricted portion goes for
purposes speciﬁcally designated
by the board of trustees, such as
the computing fee. The unre-
stricted portion, roughly half of
the FY 1996 operating budget,
includes tuition revenue and the
state appropriation.

So the state appropriation, the
amount of funds given to Pitt by
the state, also influenced the
increase in tuition.

."The wildcard was the state
appropriation," Ramicone said.
"The expectations weren't high."

Pitt will receive about $144.1

million from the state, paid to

the university in monthly install-
ments over the ﬁscal year 1996.
The appropriation did not signif-
icantly increase from last year.
In fact, while Pitt's tuition has
increased at a rate of about 45
percent over the last 10 years,
the money the commonwealth
has given to Pitt and to the state-
aided schools as a whole has
increased at only a rate of about
10 percent.
' McIntosh says this scenario is

also not unique to Pitt or to .

Pemisylvania

“Both the states and the feder-
al government have lost their
commitment to education,” she
said. “It’s a lack of priorities.”

investment for the common-
wealth to make, there’s only so
much money to go around,” he
said. “It’s really our position that
we’re doing the best we can
with the resources we have.”
The state’s commitment to
‘education is shown by programs
such as the tuition challenge
grant program, according to

Chris Corbe, spokesperson for ~

the state department of educa-
tion. The grant offers more
funds to schools that keep tuition
raises down to 4.5 percent or
under, which Pitt has done.
Also, “there is certainly a
I strong student aid program
through Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency
(PHEAA),”‘ Corbe said. ‘‘It
reﬂects a commitment to help-
ing students and their families.”

Student campaigns

USSA would like students to
strongly push both state and
national legislators to do a better
job of funding education, even
with limited resources,
McIntosh said. President Clinton
has said that he will veto any bill
that specifies drastic cuts to stu-
dent aid, but students must still
force senators to hear echoes of
discontent from the campuses
while the Senate reviews the
budget.

The House version of the bud-
get, which includes the cuts to
student aid, will go to the Senate
for review in early September. In
the past, the Senate has been
kinder to education than the
House has, said Mclntosh.

Pennsylvania Senator Arlen
will chair the

Appropriations subcommittee
that will make decisions about
the language that goes into the
bill describing funding for
education. Pitt Student
Government Board member
Keith Campbell said he believes
Specter will respond to student
lobbying power and hopes Pitt
students will provide some of
that power.

. “The Student Government
Board is now working to mobi-
lize students as part of a nation-

' wide grassroots student move-
ment to ensure continued access

to higher education,” Campbell .

said. _ .

SGB will kick off the “Save
Student Aid” campaign on
Wednesday, Aug. 30 at 6:30
p.m. in Dining Room B of the
William Pitt Union. The session

A will provide an update on pro-

posed cuts and will be atime to
plan a regional student cam-
paign.

USSA members hope other
students across the country will
take the lead to ensure that stu-
dent aid becomes a top priority
in the national budget, Mclntosh
said.

“It’s so important,” she said.
“It affects everyone."

A History houses

Carnegie
°From page A-10

This festival allows
Pittsburghers to augment their
own creative processes by work-
ing with these famous authors.

Staying on the cutting edge of
information technology, the
Carnegie library has recently
added almost twenty computers
with free Internet access.

In addition, there are numer-
ous computersconnected to
CAROLINE, the Camegie’s
automated card catalog. With
CAROLINE, any book in the
Carnegie library system can be
located.

The huge Camegie building in
Oakland also houses the
Museum of Natural History and
the Museum of Art.

-The Museum of Art was
Camegie’s gift to the people to
educate and expose them to the
best of classical art and to
improve the quality of American
art by exposing artists to
European works.

The International Art Exhibit I

is the largest contemporary
international art exhibit in the
United States and one of the two
oldest in the world.

The newest department at the
museum is dedicated to the art
of architecture. The Heinz
Architectural Center focuses on
both the architecture of
Pennsylvania and international
exhibits.

Adding a new slant to the cul-
tural aspects of Pittsburgh was
the 1993 opening of the Andy

, Warhol Museum. It's the largest

single-artist museum in the

_ United States.

The Museum of Natural
a world
renowned fossil and dinosaur
collection.

Camegie’s first major fossil
purchase was an almost com-
plete skeleton of a mastodon in
1898. Later that same year,
Carnegie found a newspaper
headline claiming the larget fos-
sil in the world had been found.

Carnegie sent the clipping of
this article and a check for
$10,000 dollars to Dr. William J.
Holland, director of the Museum
of Natural History. Camegie’s
instructions were simple: buy
this for Pittsburgh. ‘

Scientists from the Museum
of Natural History also have
found what is believed to be the
largest deposit of dinosaur fos-

sils in the world, which is"

Dinosaur National Monument in
Utah. ’

From 1909 to 1922, paleontol-
ogists worked year round at the
site, which was known to be

called Carnegie Quarry. This‘

resulted in 446 crates of fossils

' weighing 700,000 pounds being

added to the Museum.

With all the resources The
Camegie has to offer, it gives
great credit to the role that
Pittsburgh plays in educating not
only the city, but also the world.

“The defining element of any
city is its arts and culture,” said
Pittsburgh mayor Tom Murphy.

. “The success of The Camegie is

a remarkable story about the
kind of city we have and how
deeply we believe in what
deﬁnes this city.” .

University of Pittsburgh Mmldaya August 23, 1995

  
   
   

I - Jewish

  Topray ornot to pray? That is the problem

“That '5 me in

 ing my reli-
 gion.” ‘
Michael Stipe
of REM sang
_those lyrics a

    

Mark few years ago,
Gordon and I have no

idea what the
heck he was talking about,

I. but I think this happens at

Pitt. Thousands of freshmen
come here every September,

and a good portion of those

‘lose their religion. I sort of
lost mine my freshmanyear,

. and now, my senior year, I
sort of have it back.

Jews, Catholics,

-"Protestants, whatever. No

more parents to force them to
go to Friday night services or

- Saturday Mass. Who wants
» to goto some religious’ ser-

vice when you could be
going to Peter’s Pub or a

-_ football game or aparty?

I tried whenI was fresh-

1 man. Two weeks after I got
here they were staring me

right in the face— thertwo
most religious days in the
_ religion, Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur. l

A ' ‘heard about some Hillel thing
.'_ on North Craig Street, so off

I went.
I didn’t think it would take
me only two weeks to 

dying to go back home, but
that’s what I felt like after 10
minutes at this Rosh
Hashanah dinner. No offense
to the‘ people at Hillel, they
tried real hard, but it just
wasn’t my grandmother’s
cooking. - _

After dinner I went off to
the Assembly Room in the
William Pitt Union for a ser-
vice sponsored by Hillel.
Looking around, I noticed a
guy wearing sweat pants and
a couple of girls in shorts and
tee-shirts. The whole thing
didn’t sit well with me. It
just. wasn’t like home.

The following week 1 pre-

pared for Yom Kippur, the _

most religious day in the
Jewish year where it is" cus-
tomary to fast. I was awak-
ened by my next-door neigh-
bor in the glorious Tower B
residence hall to the sound
of Temple of the Dog singing
“Hunger Strike.” Funny.

My religious crusade didn’t
get much easier in April
when Passover rolled around.

Pretty soon, many of you will‘

be trying to swallow some-
thing from the Towers cafete-
ria. ‘Imagine a Towers menu
with no breaii or fl.our. It‘s
not a pretty sight. ,
Friends nf mine who prac-
tice dif:‘.:‘:ent religions also
have €T:U3.l'l€ up with some

good excuses or they do
some serious cutting of cor-
ners. My buddy Sam once
planned on going to a Mass
at a certain church because it
was known for it’s quickness.
I think it started at 6:10 p.m
and ended at 6:15.

Another friend of mine suf-

fers from hangover syn-

drome. She says she just
can’t get up in time for
Sunday morning mass. One
too many rum and Coke from
Peter’s Pub, I guess.

“Those services are just
way to early,” she complains
as she grabs a couple of
Tylenol. _

Lucky for me, in my reli-
gion most holidays begin in
the early evening, usually at
sundown, which has aided
me in my quest to recapture
my religion. Like Hanukkah,

_ which has developed into the

Jewish answer to Christmas
for a lot of Jews.

-Sophomore year, the first
night of Hanukkah, 1 was in
Sutherland Hall preparing to
go a Pitt basketball game
when I heard that Mike in
Room 512 had a menorah.
Well, off we went to the TV
lounge. A 10-word prayer

"that .I had been forced to

The Pitt News, Monday, August 28, 1995

Why are you here?

Well, what would an orientation issue be without an advice
column? (Really, we old people just like to spew forth little
tidbits of wisdom every now and then. It makes us feel
important.) Let us begin by saying welcome! To some, wel-
come for the first time; to the rest, welcome back. OK, that’s
out of the way,‘ back to the real world.

First thingsfirst, you are at college now. This is not any-
thing like high school. College is an experience unlike any-
thing you have ever known. Accept that now. Do not expect
your professors to care if you were sick for a day and don’t
have your homework on a certain day. There are no hall pass-
es here. If you have to go’, get up and go. There is no school
disciplinarian to stop you from throwing spit balls or smok-
ing. Spit and smoke all you want. There is no truant officer
to make you go to class. Cut as often as you like. No one
really cares what you do.

Well, that should make everyone feel nice and cozy. Really,
for a large university you will find it remarkable how many
times you have class with the same people, how easily pro-
fessors learn your name and remember you after the class is
over, how easy it is to get to know people who will become
your best friends. The only way you can be just a number is
if you allow it to happen. The best way to do that is to cut
class, sit in the back of the room like a stump when you do
go, and slip out early every session. If the professor is kind
enough to ignore you and let you remain a number, you are
lucky. What is more likely is that your grades will be miser-
able.

While all the other things we have said are true —— there are

.no passes, disciplinarians, etc. — be aware that there are

consequences for every action. If you choose to skip class all
the time, throw spitballs or otherwise act like a moron, you
will be forced to accept the responsibility for that behavior.
At college you can’t have mommy call to explain to the dean
that you were dropped on your head as a child (and if she did
you would be mortified anyway, right?) and should be
excused for your stupidity.

Figure out whyyou are here (presumably to get an educa-
tion) and follow that goal. Parties, drinking, sports, going
out, etc. are all a part of the college experience. But the main
purpose of going to college is, we are sad to say, to get an
education. That is what should come before everything else.

If nothing else, remember that someone (whether it is you,
your parents, your grandparents, or your pet goldfish who
does a circus act) is spending a hellish amount of money to
‘put you through school. Don’t waste that money. You are
also going to spend a considerable amount of time here —— at
least three years, probably four or more. Don’t waste that
time. Finally, you had to have something going for you to get
into college. Don’t waste yourself.

Whoever said that college should be the best time of your
life is certainly right. You can learn about anything you want
to here. You will make some of the best friends you could
have. You will experience things you never even thought of
before. But there is no reason why you can’t have a great
time and get the best education possible at the same time.
Remember, it won’t be very fun if you fail out of school and
have to leave.

It's nothing but Greek to him

he new semester is
about to begin, and
for a lot of you new

folks, these first few weeks
will be a time when many
new ideas and possibilities
you had never considered or
possibly even heard of will
scream for your attention.
As you dither through your
options, one which will
undoubtedly arise at some
point is the Greek system.
Since the decision whether
or not to join a fraternity or
sorority is one much greater
than it might appear, I come
to offer some hopefully
helpful advice to those of
you who may consider this
route.

There are many fraterni-
ties and sororities at Pitt,
and you’ll find (by goingto
parties, seeing posters, talk-
ing with friends and actually
meeting some of their mem-
bers) that each one has a
particular “flavor”; don’t
believe anyone who says
that “they’re all the same.” I
won’t attempt to describe
which ones are good for you
— that’s for you to decide.
There are, though, (in my
opinion) good and bad rea-
sons to choose a fraternity
or sorority. ,

One of the worst criterion
to go by is to join a “popu-
lar” house. How well-known
a house is is a product of a
number of factors, not all of
which are necessarily good.
House size, location and
alumni financial support can
all help or hurt a house’s
reputation, yet none of these
say much about the members
of these houses. Many hous-
es might brag about how
well they perform at differ-
ent Greek functions, such as
Greek Week. But again, that
is somewhat a product of
resources, and quantity does
not equal quality, though
don’t think I’m saying that
they can’t coincide.

A second way to make a
bad decision is to go to
rushing (i.e. recruiting) par-
ties and to base your deci-

sion solely on that. It isn’t
that this is a worthless crite-
rion. The type of party that a
house throws is a reﬂection
of what kind of members
that house has: in a sense,
it’s an expression. However,
the purpose of these parties,
beyond the personal recre-
ation of that house’s mem-
bers, is to impress you. This
doesn’t mean that what you
are seeing is fake; it’s just
incomplete. There is much
more to being a Greek mem-
ber than drinking and get-
ting laid. That leads to my
next point. (As a side note,
for those of you who don’t
drink, don’t worry about the
peer pressure; the great
majority of Greeks I’ve
known don’t care, and in
fact, would respect you
more for standing your
ground than for giving in to
whatever is popular.)
Joining a Greek organiza-
tion is not a frivolous mat-
ter. More or less depending
on the house that you join, it
can be a very large commit-
ment. It takes, first of all,
some money for most, and
for some it can get a bit
expensive. More than that, it
can require a good amount
of time and energy. This
leads into the most impor-
tant point, and that is
grades. Many friends of
mine have joined houses
only to have their grades
fall, forcing them to choose
between the two. And while
I am not going to tell you
which to choose, I can tell
you from experience that
memories of good times
only go so far when you are
struggling to get a job above
McDonald’s. And if grades
do mean a good amount to
you, and you are in a house
that devalues them and
doesn’t care too much how
many other priorities it
sticks on you, then you have
to ask yourself how much
this house knows about
brotherhood or sisterhood.
That, my freshfriends, is
the best reason to join. Each

house will define differently
what it means, but I can give
you a general idea.
Friendships, unfortunately,
come and go, and "many of
them end for bad reasons. To
be a member of a Greek
organization, however,
means being a member of a
group of permanent friends.
Friendship can often take a
bit of work, and it is the best
houses that put the most
work into it. Brotherhood
and sisterhood, as I have
experienced it, means
putting every effort it a
common goal of, to be
cheesy, “brotherly love.” If
you can go to your house
both to have good times and
to work through bad, then it
has done its job. I don’t
mean to make a house sound
more like a support group,
but I cannot emphasize how
many people I have known
who have joined a house
only to leave to find out that
they just couldn’t get along.
.You can buy a keg anywhere
— you can’t buy a brother
or sister.

So if you are serious about
joining a house, get to know
some of its brothers or sis-
ters. Find out what kind of
people are there, because it
is those people more than
anything else that will even-
tually determine whether or
not joining is the right thing
for you. ‘

Don’t think that I am
pushing anyone to join here.
Being Greek is simply not
for a lot of people, and
that’s fine. But for some of
you, it may be the right
thing, and the fruits of actu-
ally making the right deci-
sion are almost indescrib-
able. I got both great times
and lifetime friends out of
being a Sig Tau back at
CMU, and I hope that if
some of you decide to take
this route that you approach
it wisely, so that you can get
the same.

‘a lot of changes since I first

came here in the fall of 1980
(yes, it’s been that long -— how
could I stand it?) While you will
certainly find out about the
things that change while you’re
here, you may be interested in
some of the things that have
changed dramatically since.

Get ready for a trip back in
time — to “Lost Pitt.”
Schenley Hall

Actually, this place still exists,
or more accurately, the building
still does. You may even be in it
right now —- it’s the former
name of the VV1lliam Pitt Union
-— but it looks nothing like when
I first came here. A «

It still resembled the hotel tha
it used to be, what with the tile
ﬂoors and commodes in every
room; if you had some kind of
meeting upstairs, you took your
life in your hands, especially if
the weather was bad outside.
The main entrance was on
Forbes Avenue and it didn’t have
connecting ramps to the rest of

   

campus the way it does now. The
interior was painted a dull yel-
low and featured a staircase that
went literally nowhere. I tell you,
it was UG-LEE! !! .
The recreation area, which
consisted of tables, chairs, a few
vending machines and little else,

was on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, where one ‘

of the assembly rooms is now. It
contained my all-time favorite
pinball game, “Flight 2000.” (As
a matter of fact, a lot of people
liked it, so much that it stayed
down a lot.) When I was on the
Pitt Hotline, a peer counselling
service which no longer exists,
we had a little cubicle there, and
I’m surprised we had as much
privacy as we did. The basement
was non-functional at that time.

Thankfully, renovations began
the following year, and though
they took a while, you see the
results.

So why did it not retain the

name of “Schenley Hall?” Well,

it came down to this: Money.
Seems that the heirs of Mary

Schenley, a 19th-century philan- _

thropist who also gave her name
to a city park and a high school
within walking distance of carn-
pus, wanted the university to pay
for use of the name. Thus, it

became the William Pitt Union.
Pitt vs. Penn State .
As far as this native

Pittsburgher’s concerned, this
rivalry has been far overrated,
for two reasons. One, it was

always pretty much limited to
one football game that took
place either around Thanksgiv-
ing or the week before. The
men’s basketball teams haven’t
played each other since 1982,
and contests in other sports just
never generated the fan interest.
Two, in my lifetime, except dur-
ing that period in the late ‘70s
and early ‘80s when future All-
Pros were matriculating at Pitt,
PSU has dominated. That’s the
reason I was a Lion fan growing
up. (Please forgive me.)

So why did the “battle of
Pennsylvania” end? Well, most
of the blame rests on the shoul-
ders of Penn State football coach
Joe Patemo, with an assist to the
Big East Conference. About 14
years ago Patemo, who at the
time was also athletic director,‘
wanted to upgrade Penn State’s
basketball program (it had been
either an independent or part of
what’s now the Atlantic 10), so
he approached the Big East
about joining. Perhaps con-
cerned about State’s lack of
access to a major media market
and basketball tradition, the Big
East tumed him down ﬂat.

Patemo then got the idea of an
eastern all-sports league, which
would also have included Pitt,
West Virginia, Temple, Rutgers,
Boston College and Syracuse.
Big problem for the Big East,

since the last two schools were

conference members, and its

officials were concerned that
State’s leverage (by possibly
cancelling the football series
with BC and SU) would pull
them out. Reluctantly, the Big
East went after Pitt, collapsing
Patemo’s plans. So after State
joined the Big Ten+l, he decided
he had “no room for Pitt” on the
schedule. Anyway, the last game
was held at ,State\College in
1992, with Pitt being wiped out,

«57-13. Ironically, the eastern

conference he dreamed about
has since come to pass; he’s just
not a part of it. And if you’re
wondering, Pitt and Penn State
will indeed meet on the football
field again, beginning in 1997,
only earlier in the season. (Big
Ten rules prohibit games against
non-conference opponents after
its conference season begins.)
Greek Life

I have fond memoriesof the
“Bayard Street Rockers,” my
name for a quintet of fraternities
—- Phi Kappa Theta, Delta Tau
Delta, Zeta Beta Tau (which I
belonged to), Theta Chi and
Sigma Chi — which then called
the 4600 and 4700 blocks of
Bayard Street home. I wouldn’t
really call us “Animal Houses,”
but we sure did know how to
party, and while there wasn’t a
‘lot of closeness, the frats did
cooperate on occasion. That
helped one night whenwe had a
ﬁght at our house during a 1982
fall rush party and the Delts gave

us a hand.
In those days rush lasted pretty
much the entire months of

September and January; two ~

weeks open, two weeks closed.
After rush, most frats would
charge a couple of bucks to get
into parties, and someone would
have one just about every week-
end. That is, until neighbors

located some kind of then-unen-

forced ordinance that declared
that practice illegal — something
about selling alcohol without a
license. Anyway, we were
unusual in that our dance ﬂoor
was in the living room and not
the basement like other houses.
Things began to change in
1983, when the university insti-
tuted dry open rush. While many
houses complained, we actually

made a go of it, and the IFC -

lauded us for our efforts. That
was also the last year of the
Bayard Street.Rockers, as all
ﬁve fraternities moved up behind
Pitt Stadium in the fall of 1984.
Now, of course, rush is totally
dry (in theory anyway), lasts one
week and ZBT national has
abolished pledging.

Are things easier or harder
than before? Can’t say —
they’re just different. And they
will be different 10 or 20 years
from now, so hang on to your
memories. They are valuable.

Freshmen, welcome to

___._._ reshmen,
Jarrod Fwelcome
Caruso ‘ to the
ultimate party!
That’s right, you are about to
enter the wonderful world of

“college where every night

includes alcohol and members
of the opposite sex, and every
morning includes Tylenol,
warm beer and cold pizza.
And your cover charge will
only be $5,600 a year plus
expenses. Who could ask for
a better deal? Of course some
of you, the ones who really
party hard, the ones who mas-
ter the beer bong andthe 21-
shot salute, may graduate

from the party and only spend

$2,800. But you get your

‘money’s worth.

Speaking of the tuition bill,
have any of you taken a look

‘ at the breakdown? After
. $2,600 for the classes you

take, there are a number of

fees. The reason I bring this
up is,,well, I have to pay them
too. My advice, use them. The
university gets a good deal of
my money and yours, so use
every dollar’s worth.

For example, you pay a
$110 computer network fee
—— use it. This gives you
access to the wonderful world
of the Internet, ‘e-mail, word
processors, cyberporn and so
forth. Hey, e-mail is the
quickest and easiest way to
keep in touch with your
friends at other colleges. But

the most important reason to‘

use it is it costs you $110
every semester whether you
use it or not!

All of these fees are
assessed whether you use
them or not. There is a securi-
ty and transportation fee -
you have, for $30 each term,
unlimited access to the uni-
versity shuttles. Ride them

around for hours, back and
forth. They can’t stop you.
Get your money’s worth!
Student Health fee —— $46 a
semester. Get sick weekly and
use it. Of course, they won’t

treat hangovers. This doesn’t V

mean you can’t try to get $46
a term worth of aspirin or
Pepto Bismol. I’ve never used
Student Health; of course, I’m
waiting until the end of next
term, right before I graduate,
to demand my $368 worth of
condoms, Tylenol and
antacids (not necessarily to all
be used at the same time).
This of course brings us to
the student activity fee that so

many of us waste — $40 a.

term!! Join each and every
club you can, even if they all
meet at the same time. Now
this doesn’t include fraterni-
ties or sororities, where you
have to" pay an additional

$500 a year to make some

the ultimate

party !

rich friends for future consid-
eration when you need _bail a
few years down the road. But
it wouldn’t be college without
them around. I’m referring to
student groups like the chess
club or gaming club or turkey
on rye club at Denny’s. It
doesn’t matter —- just join a
club or student group of some
sort.

.I’m the president of the
College Republicans. If you
are of a conservative mind or
are republican in nature, come
to a meeting. If you and I are
diametrically opposed, then
go to a University Democrats
meeting. Concerned femi-
nists, join the Campus

Women’s Organization. There’

is a group out there for every
kind of person. The point is,
get involved. Through

The university, gener

Iassu
 m e

: everyone has
now been
exposed to the
' wonderful reg-
istration process
here at the Ivory
Tower, some for
the first time
and some for more times than
they can count. For those of

   

Erika
Kendra

you who are freshmen, wel- ‘

come to the wonderful world of

» long lines, closed classes and

required courses. For those of
you who have been around a
bit longer, thank God you are
one semester closer to enduring
this process for the last time.

As you sat through your reg-
istration meeting— last spring or
over the summer, you may
have noticed a lengthy list of
“general education” require-
ments which all CAS students
need to fill before you will be
eligible to receive your over-
priced wall hanging (i.e.
“degree”). Sorry, there’s no
way around it. (Believe me, if
therewas a way I would have
found it by now.)

Since these courses are
“Required,” most students
never question them, at least
not out loud. But (especially
for those of you who are new
to the process) you should
think about what you are being
forced to spend your time and
money on.

. First are the “skills require-
ments”: basic writing, general
writing and quantitative reason-
ing. These are (fortunately for
some) requirements’ you may
place out of by doing well on
entrance exams or the SATs.

I have no problem with the
quantitative reasoning require-
ment, since the type of thinking
required for these classes is a
valuable asset in life.

The composition and writing
requirements, however, are a
different matter. I was fortunate
enough to be exempted from
these requirements. But from

whatlcountless. people. have —-

told me, these classes are noth-
ing more than an indoctrination
into politically correct writing.

I would have no problem with «

requiring students to take a
class on how to write a good
paper, but not one on what to
write in a paper. It seems that

grammar and structure are not
as important as belief and view-
point. This, as a requirement, is
ridiculous.

Then, as you all know, we are
all required to fill a foreign lan-
guage requirement: two semes-
ters (l0 credits) of the same

language‘. You may have been’

able to place out of this one if
you took three years of the
same language in high school.
Many of us. did not. I sat
through two hours of Spanish
every day over the past summer
to fill this one. I crammed 28
weeks (two semesters’ worth)
of Spanish into l4, and I will be
lucky if I remember how to say
“The desk is made of wood” by
next week. Two semesters is
not enough to be functionally
literate in any language, but I
spent 10 credits’ worth of time
“learning” it anyway.

Well, on we move to the gen-
eral education requirements.

This package of 13 fun-filled
courses can (and must) be
yours for the minimal price of
around $20,000. To start off
your prize package, you will be
entitled to enroll in a music or
art class. You will get to spend
an entire semester either listen-
ing to jazz or classical music, or
looking at paintings. I like jazz,
classical music and paintings,
but none of this is at all rele-
vant, since these classes usually
start with around 400 people
the first day and fall to around
200 during the last week.
People don’t drop the class,
they just don’t go. And some of
them still get good grades. How
important or educational is
that?

Onward and ‘upward. You
now must‘ take a literature
course, a history course, a phi-
losophy course and a public
policy course. (You will also be
required to take a second

course in one of the latter three
areas.) In principle, these are
not bad requirements. Everyone
should have at least heard of
some of the literary master-
pieces, be able to pinpoint the
general century of the
American Revolution and know
that Hobbes was not just a
stuffed tiger. You should also

know a little bit about how gov-

ernment works, so I don’t dis-
agree with the public policy
requirement either. These
courses also help students
develop good writing skills, so
they can be beneficial. -
These requirements could, in
theory, be ‘very educational and
could conceivably turn each of
us into a Well-Rounded Person.
The problem is that the require-
ments are so narrowly defined
that only a few classes each
semester count to fill them. For
example, not just any literature
class will fill the first—level lit-

B-7

al education, and general waste

erature requirement. The ones
that do are the lower-level
courses that don’t expose stu-
dents to much more than a
novel or two. The same is true
of the other humanities require-
ments. How round can this
make a person? If the universi-
ty wanted to make everyone
take a history course, shouldn’t
any history course count?

The next stop on your whirl-
wind tour of knowledge is the
sciences. You will, during your
tenure here, take either two
“life sciences” and one “natural
science,” or the other way

around. Either way, you will.

take nine credits of science
before making the great egress.
Here is where my main prob-
lem lies. Even those of you
majoring in underwater basket
weaving will sit through these
courses, probably some sort of

Way down
south in the
land of  

biscuits
———————— “No lie, the
Sarah a v e r a g e

Stevenson Yankee knows

about as much
about the South as a hog knows
about the Lord is plan for salva-
tion.  — William Price Fox

If anyone had told me a few
years ago that the time would
come when I’d crave a plate of
biscuits and gravy, I would
have laughed. Loudly. Yet here
I sit in an apartment in Oakland
wanting nothing more than a
big serving of sausage gravy
and buttermilk‘ biscuits. With
grits. A strange change of
events.

I grew up about anhour out-
side of Pittsburgh, in Grove
City. For most of my life I pret-
ty much assumed I’d attend
college at a large in-state uni-
versity such as Pitt. Yet the
spring of my senior year-in
high school, I found myself
agreeing to attend a small
Tennessee college “nestled in
the foothills of the great Smoky
Mountains.” -Not just small,

tiny. What was I thinking? Here‘

I was, committing myself to
spending time at Maryville

My parents went there, my

grandparents went there, my
great—grandparents taught
there, my —— well, you get the
idea. But I liked it, sort of.
Besides, time was running out;

I had to choose. And they‘

offered me money. So I decid-
ed to try it.

When I arrived on campus
for orientation, my doubts

grew. The campus wasn’t near '

anything, not anything with

, entertainment value, anyway. It

seemed that everyone I met
had a strong (read: annoying)
Southern accent, even those
who claimed to be from some-
where other than the South.
_People referred to me as a
“Northerner” and laughed at
how annoyed I got with their s-
1-0-w pace. As we ate our
meals in the cafeteria, (We
have only one. Cafeteria that
is, not meal.) country music
blared over the sound system.
What had I gotten myself into‘?

When some people I knew
slightly asked me if I wanted to
go to a club in Knoxville, I
jumped at the chance. Once we
entered the door, though, I
realized it was a line—dancing
club. I spent the rest of the
evening dodging “good ol’
boys” whose belt buckles were
larger than their heads and
convincing my friends that I
was just fine sitting in the cor-
ner. Really. I began to wonder

asaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

College (no, it’s not a “girl’s
school”). It’s the family school.

how difficult it would be to
transfer in the middle of the
semester.

I am now halfway through
my undergraduate education,
and I am still a student at
Maryville. It took some time,
but I truly appreciate my
school and many aspects of the
South now. I met people who
share my interests. I became
involved with the theater and
the college newspaper. I met
others who don’t like country
music, line-dancing or the UT
Volunteers. And I became
friends with those who do in
spite of our different tastes.

This is not to say that I have
remained unchanged. As I
mentioned before, I now like
Southern food. A lot. I can dis-
tinguish between most
Southem accents, and further-
more, I occasionally drawl
myself. I think “y’all” should
be accepted as proper English
grammar-. I Say “excuse me,”
“please,” “thank you,”
“ma’am” and “sir” without fail.
I bristle when people make
jokes about the South or
Southerners. I think the Smoky
Mountains are absolutely beau-
tiful, and there’s nothing I’d
rather do on the weekend then
go camping or hiking in them.
And there are plenty of things
to do in Knoxville that aren’t

‘ I am currently living in
Pittsburgh for the summer, and
my time here has shown me
how accustomed I’ve become
to certain things in just two
years, such as the slower pace.
City life has been a little bit of
a wake-up call. I’ll be surprised
if I stumble upon someone
working the checkout line at
Giant Eagle who holds up other
customers to have a conversa-
tion with me. Whenever I say
“sir” or “ma’am,” people look
twice to see if I’m being sar-
castic. I think they believe I
am. And although I love
bagels, what I’d really like is a
huge plate of biscuits and
gravy. (I don’t think that’s on
Schwartz’s menu.)

The choice of college I made
is not for everyone. (Obviously
— look at our enrollment.) I
am enjoying my time in
Pittsburgh, and I will most like-
ly end up in a city when the
time for graduate school
comes. For now, though, I am
content to be heading back to
begin my junior year. One of
my friends from Alabama once
commented that there’s some-
thing kind of backwards about
going to the South to become
open—minded. Maybe so, but
I’m glad it’s happening.
Perhaps one day I’ll even learn
to line-dance. Nahh.

You’ll remember. You will
remember that your anonymity
gives you both refuge from, and
rejoicing for the fact that you
can be some “one.” Make a
name for your “self,” a self that
will evolve and change.

Values and judgments will
shift and rattle quicker than the
coins in a panhandler’s cup.
Saturday’s social connections
and philosophies will shift by
next Friday. It will seem quite
logical to you that, to borrow
from Rene Descartes, ‘‘I think
therefore I am,” early in the fall
term, changes to: “I think, there-
fore I am [not sure]” later when
the autumn chills-

You’ll feel the chills too.
Perhaps for the first time‘ you’ll
be sick without Dr. Mom stand-

fered with a roornie who has the
hygiene of a sewer slug, and
cares more about world peace
than those pieces of stomach lin-
ing you’re losing through vari-
ous exit openings of the body.

It will be cold outside too.
You’ll realize this because you
will be walking. Yes, as in walk-
ing on the planet Earth, versus
driving.

More of your travels will be
vertical as you try to catch an
elevator to class. Due to their
slowness, you’ll walk more
steps.

Steps that will also include
walking over and on people as
you kick and ﬁght your way to
great grades. With other steps,
you will walk with people.
Cherish and respect those
friends and associates when you
find yourself walking “with.”

You will change and reﬂect
while you are here. You will
begin to look into the mirror
more for contemplation and
courage than for cosmetology.

Cosmically, I believe I know
you. We both shoulder the
changes that are always ongo-
ing.

Personally, I know the two
semesters I spent not going to
my geology classes (and still
getting good grades) was a
valuable experience. I can now
tell you authoritatively that the
earth7is round, and that it
revolves around some other big

Six credits wasted.

The final trip on your excur-
sion is the foreign culture
requirement group. This one I
have no problem with, and I
actually think everyone should
take a few of these’ courses.
(No. I don’t disagree with
ei>er_vtl1irzg !)

The rationalization behind
the general education require-
ment is to expose all college
students. to a range of different
fields. It is generally believed

' that. as naive freshmen, none of
us could possibly have any idea
about what we would want to

do with our lives, right‘?
Wrong. Many of us know
exactly what we intend to do,
or at least have a good idea.
While the concept of exposing
people to different fields for

those who are unsure might be

a good one, the general educa-
tion requirements actually
penalize those of us who have
decided what we want to do.
This is not high school, and

there are countless advisors on

this campus to help us make
decisions about our schedules.

While they should encourage’

students to take courses in dif-
ferent areas, we should be able
to make the ultimate decision.

«If a student makes a bad deci-

sion, it will become evident
readily "enough. But in order to
learn to be adults, we must all
learn to make our own deci-
sions and learn from our mis-
takes, shouldn’t we?

By Sean Drmcan

‘ Managing Editor

Tom Tumulty carnouﬂages his cool stare behind the 10
steel bars on his facemask Cocked and poised, he’s like a
sniper waiting for the perfect moment to pull the trigger. He
quickly glances around the defense, checking if everyone is
in the right alignment, and then anxiously awaits the snap of

He has a knack for the ball, he’s strong and quick, and has
the killer instinct necessary to make big-time plays.

“He’s a linebacker,” Babich said. “If you just threw him
out there and didn’t tell him anything, he would tackle the
ball. That’s how good linebackers are.”

“He lays it on the line at all times,” fellow linebacker
David Sumner said. “It’s straight football, with no ifs, ands
or buts about it” -

game, NFI.

But the award doesn’t interfere with Tumulty’s goals.

“It’s not distracting,” he said. “Yeah I’m an All-America
Butkus candidate, but tell me after I win it and I’ll be happy
because right now I’m concentrating on having a good year
and going to a bowl game. It’s ﬂattering, but I don’t talk
about it unless it’s 

If Tumulty has the type of year he and everyone else
expects, I00-plus tackles is well within his reach — after all,

he’s done it before. That would make him Pitt’s third

It’s a run play to the left. Tumulty anticipates the
movement and meets the back at the line of scrimmage.

Tumulty plays it like a fourth—and—goal situation in the
Orange Bowl.

“Tom’s always intense,” linebacker coach Bob Babich
said. “He goes full speed at every snap. He’s never satis-
ﬁed with himself, he’s always trying to get better.”

Tumulty’s intensity, coupled with his all—around ability,
is what makes the ﬁfth-year senior one of the most feared
linebackers in the nation and the heart of Pitt’s defense.
Already the Panthers’ llth all-time leading tackler, the 6-

best season ever.
“I’m more ﬂexible now,” Tumulty said. “I’m thinner,
but not lighter. I put on some good weight —— 9 percent

For a player who’s especially good at stopping the run,
that’s bad news for opposing running backs. Tumulty’s
offseason additions came after he hyperextended his
knee in last year’s Homecoming game against West
Virginia

“I just thank God I have strong tendons and ligaments,
or it would have been a total blowout,” he said.

Regardless, the injury dampened a statistically tremen-
dous season and his chances of wimring the Butkus

But even after missing two games and seeing limited
action in three others, Tumulty totaled 82 tackles, sec~
ond-best on the team.

But this year, winning the Butkus Award is not just a
fantasy for Tumulty, it’s reality. The award is a natural ﬁt

all-time leading tackler, only behind Arnie
Weatherington and the legendary Hugh Green.

In ‘93, his redshirt sophomore year, Tumulty
notched 114 tackles, 73 of which were unassisted. He
also tabbed three sacks and two interceptions. But the
single game that spoke volumes about Tumulty was
the season opener at Southern Mississippi.

The scenario had all the makings for greatness. It
was Johnny Majors’ ﬁrst game game back in his sec-
ond stint as head coach. It was televised nationally on
ESPN, even though the two teams were mediocre at
best. Tumulty made the best out of the prime-time
opportunity. When the smoke cleared, he recorded 17
tackles, two interceptions, a sack and a Pitt win.

‘That Southern Miss game he was making plays
left and right,” Sumner said. “Everyone was dead
tired, but was still out there making plays.”

Tumulty’s ‘93 performance was even more
remarkable in that he sat out all of ‘92 with an injury.

“I was ready to go,” Tumulty said of the ‘92 sea-
son. “I worked real hard. I was real strong, but not
ﬂexible.”

But against Kent in the ﬁrst game, he tore a pec-
toral muscle. Redshirted, he was sidelined for the year.
But this may have been a hidden blessing.

“I think that was God telling me to slow down
because everything happens for a reason,” Tumulty
said of his ﬁrst serious injury. “I didn’t deserve to get
hurt, but I think everything was going too fast I didn’t
really appreciate anything. I was just assuming I was
going to play football for a long time. I didn’t do any
school work. It was His way of telling me, ‘Calm

When the Pitt Panthers welcome Washington State to Pitt Stadium for the season open-

er Saturday, Sept 2, all eyes  be on the offense.

The 1993 season saw the Panthers ﬁnish an embarrassing seventh out of eight teams in .
the Big East in total offense. The team ﬁnished 3-8 that year. Last year was going to be a
turnaround, , but Pitt once again ﬁnished 3-8, though with a .
noticeable improvement. The offense bounced back and ﬁnished
' second in the conference behind  As Pitt enters the 1995 _
season, there will be some large shoes to ﬁll from the ‘94 squad,

but the team is conﬁdent the challenge can be met.

“We were second in the conference last year, and I honestly- 
' think that this group has" a chance to be better,” said offensive line

coach Jack Hemy. .

Overall, the Panthers will have to replace ﬁve starters on -
offense, including three from the solid offensive line. Lost to
graduation were Ruben Brown, the 14th pick in the 1995 NFL

-draft; center and four-year letter winner Lawson Mollica; and

three-year letter winner Matt Bloom;

“Those guys did a great job while they were here You only see
so many of those in your life. These guys now know how good
the others were, but I don’t think their goal is ‘necessarily to
replace them. Instead it is to just come out and have agood offen-

sive line,” Henry said.

Redshirt sophomore Reggie Thomas (6-5, 260) will start at

center after starting all 11 games last season at left guard

“I think it’s going to work out real well,” Thomas said. "The
transition has been smooth. I still have to work out a few bugs —
getting the technique down for instance —— but all in all, it’s going V

well.”

Jeff Craig, a 6-5 285—pound junior, is slated to start at right
guard, while Jon Marzoch, a redshirt sophomore, beat out junior

Tim Glass during spring camp and will start at left guard.

“Inexperience isn’t a concern for me, because I think we’re P th 9 N 1 t b k
coming together as well as an inexperienced line could We are an ers 0 quar er ac

really gelling,” Marzoch said.

Sophomore Tony»Orlandini is expected to start at right tackle, but he will no doubt get
competition from converted defensive lineman Tim Robbins. Matt Hosilyk (6-4, 285)
also makes the switch from defense to offense and may get the nod at left tackle after
senior Brian Curran went down with an injury. ‘
Senior tight end Dell Seagraves will once again start this year. He will have sophomore
John Jones, last season’s Ed Conway Award winner for most improved offensive player,

breathing down his neck.

The special teams p

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

T The Pitt kickers and punters might as well rent a
clown car. Early at summer camp, they could have
filled one up, with characters ranging from happy to
sad as they booted footballs at Johnny’s big top.

The Panthers had a total of eight kickers and punters
in the first couple of days of training camp at the
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown earlier this
month. One of those is not a happy camper. He is last
season’s opening game quarterback, Sean Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald, a senior, was asked by head coach,

Johnny Majors to compete for the punting spot‘ cur-
rently occupied by Nate Cochran. Kickers coach Steve
Bird said it is an open competition for the spot, but
early on Fitzgerald was not getting much of an oppor-
tunity and Cochran looked like he was ready to put last
year’s off-season behind him. V ,

“The last game of last season is the worst I ever had.
It probably is one of the biggest disappointments of
my life,” Cochran said.

He was talking about last year’s Rutgers game,

i where he punted seven times for a dismal 31.3 yard

average, 10 yards lower than his season average. That
game, added with his slumping sophomore season,
prompted Majors to bring Fitzgerald into the mix, sort
of.

“I kind of got bored not getting any reps at QB so I
started kicking,” said a disgruntled Fitzgerald. “But
now I’m not getting any reps at punting.”

“Nobody has the job right now,” Bird said. “At any
given time whoever is kicking the best will be the
punter.”

“It’s good to have competition. It makes me work
harder,” Cochran said. '

Cochran worked much harder this past summer than
last year, especially when he went to kicking camp, he

‘ ‘ said. He kicked two hours a day with former Oakland

Raider punter Ray Guy. ‘

John Ryan will start the season as the

impact player.”

little closer to the body,” Cochran said. “He taught me
things about hang time, gave me an edge.”

Another key to a successful junior season for
Cochran is his mental toughness, which he said he
gained from Panther head basketball coach Ralph
Willard during last season’s stint as a walk-on forward.

The Panthers also have an overload at the placekick-
ing position, where Bird said two freshmen will be
competing with l993’s kicker, Steve Kalmanides. The
junior from Norwalk, Conn., was redshirted last year,
and he looks to get his job back this season.

“The two freshmen, Chris Ferencik and John
Shikella looked real good so far,” Bird said after the
first two days of practice.

Shikella, 5-9, 175 pounds, is from Butler, Pa., and he
said his main goal right now is just to makethe team.

Ferencik, an Ohio native, turned down scholarship
offers from Rutgers and Michigan State because he
said he wanted to be close to home. '

“I also wanted an opportunity to play,” he said.

He said he is confident in his ability to kick at this
level, and the fact that there is a lot of kickers in camp
does not bother him.

“It’s not a contest between me and the other kickers.
It’s a contest between me and the uprights,” Ferencik
said. “I control my own destiny.” _

Todd Barton, who was also getting a look at punting,
is expected to return as the kick-off’ specialist. The
transfer from Richmond missed the spring drills last
April and May due to a back injury, but the Panthers
expect him to be 100 percent this year.

Two other kickers who were getting a shot early in
camp were junior walk-on Chris Burnett and freshman
Grant Coffield. Burnett, form nearby Baldwin,
impressed both players and coaches early at camp,
withhis long kicks. He is also the smallest kicker in the
group, coming in at 5-8, 150 pounds

The return unit is solid, according to Bird. Mark
Butler and Dietrich Jells are both back and have big
play capability.

“Dietrich is a threat every time he touches the ball,”

Pitt’s linebacking corps, otherwise known as “The Pitt Bulls,” has another little saying that
they think will keep them hungry for the ‘95 season and help nudge the rest of the defense
‘ over that hump it has been trying to reach for the past two seasons.
The saying is “Best in America.” .
V » “As we go into the ‘95 season, what we want to do as a unit is be
the best in America,” Pitt Bull trainer and linebacker coach Bob
Babich said. “So we’re just going to use that little saying ‘Best in
America’- to get us in that frame of mind and help us understand what
we have to do to be the best in America.”

The three linebackers who have the responsibility to uphold that
saying are Tom Tumulty, John McCray and David Sumner. Tumulty, ~
a ﬁfth-year senior, spearheads the corps and is the focal point of the
whole defense. For the second straight season Turnulty is a Butkus
Award candidate, which goes to the best linebacker in the country.
He was well on his way to making a strong campaign last season
before he went down with a knee injury midway through the season
that limited his playing time. But Tumulty still managed to ﬁnish as
the team’s second-leading tackler with 82.

McCray beat out last season’s leading tackler Jason Chav-is in
spring practice and never looked back

“John McCray is having a great fall so far,” Babich said. “He has
established that he can playwirming football at this level.”

McCray is no newcomer in the lineup, though. Two seasons ago
he was Pitt’s second-leading tackler. And when Tumulty went down
in the West Virginia game last year, all McCray did as his replace-
ment was collect 17 tackles and a sack If you take Tumulty’s tackle
totals and add them with McCray’s, they had 150 tackles at that posi-

Surnner is the only big move on defense. He moves from safety to
outside linebacker. At 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, it’s a relatively smooth -
transition for Sumner. =

“It’s a big time move, we’re very excited about it,” Babich said.
% “It gives us a lot of speed that we need to win football games. He’s a
natural at the position. So you can see why I’m so excited about this year, because he’s an

“At ﬁrst I wasn’t sure if I would be able to handle going against all the big linemen,” said
Surrmer, who was Pitt’s third-leading tackler last season. “But as time went on, I ﬁgured out
that it’s not always a game of size, but a game of leverage.” .

VV1th nine returning starters, the defense has plenty of experience. Butwhether that trans-

’lat’es into a big plus for the Panthers is another story. Pitt’s defense was virtually last (except
for Temple) in the Big East in almost every category. Statistically speaking, the defense’s

olleyball sets sights for eighth-straight Big East title

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

Labor Day weekend is usually filled with pic-
nics, family and friends, but this holiday week-
end will be real labor for coach Cindy Alvear
and the Pitt Lady Panther volleyball team.

The Lady Panthers, who have won the Big
East seven consecutive years, travel to the
nation's capital for the George Washington tour-
nament, where they will play four games in two
days. The Lady Panthers will go up against
Akron, Portland, Maryland and host George
Washington. ' .

The following week offers an even stiffer chal-
lenge, as the Ball State Tournament looms on
the horizon. -

“This will be a tough, tough, tournament,”
Alvear said. “With host Ball State and the
University of Paciﬁc, we are facing two squads
that are consistently in the top 25 nationally.

“Kansas will also be a concern. They are a tal-
ented, young team with great coaching.”

September does not get any easier, as Pitt will
travel to sunny California for the Loyola
Marymount Tournament on the 15th and 16th.
The Lady Panthers will be joined by
Sacramento State and Baylor at the tournament.

Pitt closes out the month with four non-confer-
ence games against American University, Texas
Tech, Youngstown State and cross-town rival
Duquesne.

“The ﬁrst month will most certainly be a test-
ing period,” Alvear said. “The upperclassmen
must step up, and I realize that freshmen will
need time. The kids will need to find their place
and learn the roles that they will have.”

When October rolls around, the competitive
Big East season begins.

. in News File Photo
Coach Cindy Alvear feels junior Stephanie Dufresne is the

C-5

Pitt has owned the Big East for most of the
decade, but there is a new kid on the block this
year: the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.

Alvear, having grown up in South Bend, Ind.,
finds it strangeto now have to battle her roots
year in and year out.

“We have a healthy rivalry with Notre Dame.
Both schools have quality programs,” she said.
“Notre Dame is usually always ranked national-

, 1y. I guess we are no longer the team to beat.”

The Lady Panthers are anxious to battle from a
different standpoint this season. Pitt fell to Notre
Dame in the NCAA Tournament last season
after losing the final three games of a best-of-
five match, all by the score of 13-15. Notre
Dame moved on to the Sweet 16; the Lady
Panthers came home. .

Alvear feels that the team has three leaders
coming into the 1995 campaign.

Six-footsenior Sarah Mikla, a native of
Hammond, Wis., has earned a great deal of
respect from her teammates.

Alvear praised Mikla by saying, “Sarah is a
great player, but more importantly, she is a quali-
ty person. She will no doubt lead our team in the
right direction.”

Middle hitter Jennie Driscoll will also be an
important piece of the puzzle this season.‘
Driscoll, from Wheaton, Ill., is a senior academi-
cally, but has two more years of eligibility.

“Jennie is a fiery girl. No matter the situation,’

she is always competing,” Alvear said.
No team is complete without the sleeper who

steps up and makes a greatimpact. Alvear‘

believes junior Stephanie Dufresne is that player.

“She is by far the unsung hero of the team,”

Alvear said. “When ‘Stephanie decided she could

Ferguson returns after posting an impressive

played linebacker for the ‘Canes at one
time. Fifth-year seniors Derrick Harris and
Kevin Brinkworth and redshirt ﬁosh Carlo

Big East Rookie of the Year in 1994, are
back and will look to welcome some new
faces this fall.

A trio of junior linebackers is back again
this season. Twan Russell, who had 55 tack-
les as a reserve in ‘94; All-American candi-
date Ray Lewis; and James Burgess are
three of the ﬁve or six who will see action,
Others include Antonio Coley, Marlin
Barnes and Cliff Jackson.

Despite losing three starters from the sec-
ondary to graduation, the ‘Canes are still
well stocked. Although he has never started
a game, safety Earl Little will likely start,
along with Carlos Jones and Juco—transfer
Duane Starks.

Davis, placing a high priority on special
teams,‘ has a pair of seniors back to handle
the lcicking duties. Dane Prewitt will look to
better his school-record 13 consecutive ﬁeld
goals, while Mike Crissy bounces back,
although tentatively, from a groin pull that
caused him to miss most of ‘94.

Miami faces another tough schedule in
‘95 and enters the season ranked as high as
10th in some polls.

Big EcistPreview:The Pih‘ News picks Miami No. l

, Warren Sapp with 8.5, and Kenard Lang,

Tech’s passing and rumiing attacks were
both second to last in the Big East last sea-
son, but yet the Hokies ﬁnished second in
the conference with a 5-2 record and 8-4
overall. ‘

The explanation for those enigmatic stats
is simple —— Tech’s defense was one of the
stingiest in the country. Head coach Frank
Beamer can expect the same this season as
he returns 10, yes 10, defensive starters. All
four defensive lineman return, led by junior
Cornell Brown, Ruben’s brother. Brown’s
11 sacks was third—best in the league last
' season, and his
numbers should go

up.
‘ The only casual-
ty in the lineback-

ing core is first-
.. team All-Big East
selection Ken Brown. Beamer won’t lose
any sleep over Brown’s departure, because
he still has senior George DelRicco to hold

‘down the middle. DelRicco’s 130 tackles

was second-best in the Big East. On the out-
side, junior Brandon Semones is back with
his 99 tackles.

, But that’s not even the scariest part of
Tech’s defense, which is pretty scary in
itself. The Hokies’ secondary is among the
tops in the nation. Three of the four
retumees earned All-Big East hon-
ors last season. Led by ﬁrst-team
pick junior Torrian Gray and his
four interceptions, Tech was sec-
ond in the conference to only
Miami (like always) in passing
defense. Senior William
Yarborough and junior Antonio
Banks both were second—team
selections.

The Hokies’ oﬂ°ense relied heavily
on the defense to put points on the
board. But it also put a lot of stock
into record-setting quarterback
Maurice DeShazo to make things

 
     
    

which leaves the job to junior Jim
Druckenmiller. He’s a 6-foot-4
dropback passer, which is a stark
opposite to DeShazo’s roll-out
style. This might cause a minor
shake up in the offense, but the
answer could lie in running back
Dwayne Thomas. Thomas rushed
for 655 yards and ﬁve TDs last

‘ Eric Prex picked the wrong year to graduate. Just as
soccer powerhouses Rutgers, Notre Dame and West
Virginia come rolling into the Big East, the speedy for-
ward is off to play professional soccer.

The Panthers’ leading scorer last year averaged
almost a point a,game, and head coach Joe Luxbacher
will‘ have his hands full as he prepares for the Big East
opener Sept. 15 at Providence. »

7 Even with Prex’s departure, the Panthers will be
returning 13 lettermen and seven starters from a team
that ﬁnished 9-8-1 overall last year. The immediate

goal for this year’s squad is to irr1_;.‘.'<.‘»‘ve on last year’s 1-

6-1 showing in Big East play.
Assistant coach Chris Karwoski is looking forward to
the challenge, especially the new competition.

“We have a lot of guys coming back and we also
have four new players,” Karwoski said. “We really feel
we can beat these [new] teams.”

Up front on the forward lines, trying to replace the
offense generated from Prex, will be seniors Todd Graf,
Dean Astorino and Knut Saeter.

While Astorino with his three letters is the leader of
the trio, Saeter. returns with the most incredible statistic.
Despite only starting three games last season, Saeter
scored five goals on seven shots, a percentage that
would have been one. of the best in the country if he
had enough attempts.

“That truly is an amazing stat,” Karwoski said. “He’s
one of the guys we can count on up front.”

' Saeter, a compact 5-9, 165-pounder was born in
Oslo, Norway, but attended nearby Upper St. Clair
High School, as did Astorino. 9

occer squad looks to improve conference play

I * By Mark Gordon

Last year the six-footer knocked in six goals and
picked up four assists. Three of his goals were game-
winning.

1 “Dean is a dangerous player. He is capable of scoring
15 goals in conference play with his speed and
strength,” said Karwoski.

Graf, from Mt. Lebanon High School, rounds out the
big three, and he is primed. for a big season. Karwoski
said he had a real good spring and is ready to break out
this year. Last year he had 12 points, scoring four goals
and assisting on four others.

In the midfield will be senior Jeff Porter, who will be
trying to shake off last year’s injury-plagued season,
when he scored three goals, a big drop from his sopho-
more year, when he knocked in eight.

“If Jeff can remain healthy, physically and mentally,
he will be one of the top midfielders in the Big East,”

Another
rivalry
ruined

omewhere,
somehow,
‘ somebody
screwed up
again.
First they took
away Pitt—Penn
State. Now, the
Columnist Pitt-West
Mark Virginia game
Gordon will be played
. the day after
Thanksgiving. ’
§ The best remaining football
rivalry at this school will be
‘played with half of the stu-

dents at home, recovering from

' Grandma’s stufﬁng. Well, at

least we have Eastern

‘Michigan on our schedule. We

all know the Panthers vs. the
Eagles has always been a
fierce rivalry.

The NCAA, Pitt, WVU and
especially ESPN are all play-
ing a role in ruining what col-
lege football is all about —
rivalries.

Remember last year’s Pitt-
WVU game? That was
absolutely the most exciting
game in any division, in any
conference, in any league the

_ whole season. Pitt coach

Johnny Majors said he had i
never been involved in a game
like that in 37 years of coach-
ing.

Pitt lost 47-41 in a game that
included two interceptions
returned for touchdowns, two
blocked ﬁeld goals and a 
blocked punt — and three lead
changes in the last two min-
utes. A crowd of almost
40,000 people packed Pitt

. Stadium that Saturday after-

noon.

The rivalry is not only on the
field. It’s in the seats and in the
press box. Pitt’s public address
man Don Ireland temporarily
resigned after last year’s game
because, in a very non-politi-
cally correct fashion, he
implied WVU fans are don-
keys. (Heck, he was right.)

Now, granted, this year’s
game would not have 40,000
screaming Pitt fans because it
is going to be played in
Morgantown, but a lot of peo-
ple who would make that 90-
minute drive to cheer for our
Blue and Gold will not be
doing it.

Even some of West
Virginia's donkeys (whoops, I
mean fans) won’t be at the
game because of the date.

You’re probably wondering
why television has screwed
with this great game.

3 ESPN and its sister station,
ESPN 2, have been playing up
the rivalry thing for all it’s

' worth, and they are just trying

to capitalize on Pitt and WVU.
I have no problem with capi-
talism, or even a little bit of
greed, but when it directly
affects the fans, it just has to
stop.

Despite losing the big three from

Fifth—year senior John Ryan

the Panthers possess excellent speed
and numerous deep threats. Dietrich Jells,

another fifth-year senior, is only 51 yards ’

away from becoming the all—time leading
receiver in school history. The record, 2,264
yards, is currently held by Dwight Collins,
who played from 1980-1983.

Juniors Mark Butler and Curtis Anderson
are both healthy, and senior Jay Jones and
sophomore Vital Joseph offer depth and expe-
rience. Two talented redshiit freshmen, Dante
Bryant and Keith Jackson are also expected to
contribute.

The biggest retumee from last season, how-
ever, is tailback Billy West. When Curtis
Martin went down with an ankle injury in the
second game, West was called upon and wast-
ed no time getting accustomed to the spotlight.

In fact, West ﬁnished the game against Ohio
University with a season-high 226 yards.

The Big East Offensive Player of the Year
tallied 1,358 rushing yards and six scores. His
123.5 yards per game average was good
enough to earn the Ohio native a place on the
All-Big East First Team and the Associated
Press honorable mention All—American squad.

“Billy West is a back with a very unique
style,” said running back coach, Charlie Coe.
“He has exceptional quickness, is low to the
ground, and is difﬁcult to bring down. Billy is
just a quality back.”

Unlike the receiving corps, depth is a prob-
lem in the backfield. The fullback position is
open with the loss of Maurice Washington to
graduation and will likely be ﬁlled by sopho-

more Chris Schneider. Schneider, who was
impressive in spring camp and workouts, will
be backed up by senior Vince \V1lliams.

Sophomore Ken Konek and true freshmen
Demetrius Harris and Karim Thompson will
also see time in the backfield, along with
senior Chris Patron.

Karcher is excited about the 1995 season
and does not anticipate any big surprises.

“Our offense will be balanced again this
year,” he said. “Billy West will no doubt touch
the ball at least 30 times a game, either rushing
or receiving. We have great players on the
perimeter and we will spread out the passing
game. Ryan is a heady player, and we will be
sure to utilize all of our abilities and just hope
for the best.”

ondary. But still, it was: only the
conference’s fifth-lead1\ g pass
defense. ”

The corners have two of the
team’s fastest members on each
side, Denorse Mosley and
Anthony Dorsett.

“Right now Denorse and
Anthony are looking very good,”
said defensive back coach Tony
Pierce, who replaced Tim Lewis.

‘ But all eyes are on Mosley, a

junior. As a sophomore, he picked
off six passes, which tied him for
fifth in the nation‘. Not only is
Mosley fast, but he has the 6-1
size to back it up.

“I think he’s in for a big year,”
Pierce said.

After moving around to several
different positions, Dorsett has
ﬁnally found his niche. He moved
into the comer spot the third game
of the season and has held it ever

since.

ﬁed, the safety slots are not Pierce
said redshirt junior Jimmy
Williams will ﬁll Surrmer’s void at
free safety. Curtis McGhee and
Eric Kasperowicz most likely will
be Williams’ backups.

Vying for the other safety spot
are redshirt freshman Chuck
Brown and John Jenkins, who saw
action in all 11 games last season.
But according to Pierce, there are

Junior cornerback Denorse Mosely listens to advice from Tony Pierce, the team’s new
defensive backs coach. Last year Mosley started all 11 games and led the Panthers with six
interceptions and 12 pass deﬂections.

no locks.

“We’re in a position to move
people around at either safety,”
Pierce said. “It’s going to be a bat-
tle. It’s going to be close back
there.”

Besides ﬁguring out what to do
with the logjam of safeties, Pierce
has to ﬁnd a way to prevent the
big play, something Pitt was sus-
ceptible to all last year.

“I think the way you correct that
is through the mindset,” he said.
“Our job is not to let people beat
us deep, and that’s what we have
to concentrate on.”

The defensive line was hit with
only one casualty, but it’s a notable
one —— second-tearn All—Big East
tackle Tom Barndt. The three
other returnees are all seniors.
Tackle Mike Halapin, a four-year
starter, will be the plug in the mid-
dle with his 6-5, 275-pound size.
At defensive end, two—year starter
Zatiti Moody has the spot, but
junior Mike Mohring is close
behind. Rounding out the line is 6-
4, 275—pounder Tyler Young.
Young, hampered with nagging
injuries last year, still managed to
start every game. He collected 4.5
sacks, which was second—best on
the team.

But the difference between last
year’s line and this year’s is depth.

“We ﬁnally have some depth.”
Tumulty said. ‘‘If someone goes
down, someone else will be able
to come in and do the jo .”

Last year the offense made the
notable improvement. This year
appears to be the defense’s tum.

In fact, Tumulty established his
name the first week of preseason
camp, which was too quick for
some jealous seniors.

knew it, Keith Hamilton just blast-
ed him. It started a whole team
ﬁght, offense vs. defense. After
that, I knew these guys were going
to take care of me. I think that’s
what I do now.”

Now, the same time ﬁve years
later, Tumulty still goes about his
business with that same intensity.
This time, he has a lot more
responsibilities than just “killing”

~ people. He has to take freshmen

under his tutelage and show them
how to be successful Division I
football players. He has to make all
the defensive calls in the huddle.
And he has to make sure his team-
mates are ready to play.

“I make sure everybody is men-
tally sound, as far as their attitude,
their emotions, to keep them under
control,” Tumulty said. “If they
make a bad play, I have to reassure
them that they’re a good player.
But the biggest responsibility is to
make sure everybody’s lined up
right and I call the right forma-

tion”

That’s a lot of pressure to put on

I a person, but Tumulty doesn’t

seem to mind

“I accept it,” he said. “lt’s not
bad pressure. I enjoy being in that
role.”

“Great players like the pressure,”
Babich said “When the garne’s on
the line, he wants the other team to
run the ball right at 

And off the ﬁeld, Tumulty has
the same kind of pressures. Just as
he’s a marked man by the 300-
pound offensive linemen, he also
feels the burning spotlight from his
fellow students. Sometimes it’s
easy to forget that star college ath-
letes are students because of all the

' hype, but Tumulty doesn’t

' “I treat everybody with respect,”
he said. “That’s how I was brought

up. I’m just as equal as any stu-
dent. I excel in a sport, where they
may excel in singing. God put us
on earth for a reason. One of my
reasons was to play football.”

But Tumulty’s collegiate career
is in the fourth quarter, and NFL
expectations are charging at him
like a 240—pound fullback. Like all
things on the ﬁeld, Tumulty will
meet the challenge head on.

“I want to play football for a
while,” he said. “It’s something
I’ve been dreaming to do. I think I
have the talent to play at the next
level. I’ve proven to be a player,
and I’m the prototypical size.”

But right now NFL goals are
secondary. Tumulty is geared up
for the ‘95 season, and more
importantly, ending Pitt’s six-year
bowl drought But realistically, is a
bowl appearance really within
reach for a team that has had back-
to-back 3-8 seasons?

Tumulty’s eyes lit up and
speared the question before it was
completed.

“It’s very realistic,” Tumulty
said with a fiery tone. “We sincere-
ly believe in it, too. Our defense is

so conﬁdent right now, we know
no one can run on us, and that’s
what we have to believe in at all
times.

“I want to go to a bowl game.
That’s why I came to the
University of Pittsburgh.”

lt’s do-or-die time, now. The
pivotal season opener against
Washington State is this Saturday.
Before every game, Tumulty said
he’s very quiet, visualizing all
good plays in his head. But right
before kickoff, “That’s when I get
crazy.”

Kind of like a sniper scoping,
then waiting and waiting until his
target is zeroed in, and then

— The receiving core is solid.
Flanker Bryan Still, and his 21.7
yards per catch average, is back
for his ﬁnal season. Still will be
joined Jermaine Holmes and
Cornelius White. Out of the seven
returning offensive starters, four of
-them are offensive linemen, which
is a big plus for Beamer. Despite
losing DeShazo, Tech’s defense
should enable the Hokies to make
their third straight bowl appear-

Before Boston College recruits

another football player it should

consider adding another class to
its curriculum: Schedule Making.

A The Eagles have road games
versus Notre Dame and Michigan,
at home battle with Michigan State
and faced off against Ohio State in
yesterday’s Kickoff Classic. If
you’re scoring at home, that’s

the usual Big East foes like 
and Virginia Tech.

But scheduling aside, BC
should be a major force in the Big
East if it can get past two key loss-

es — TE Pete Mitchell and DL
Mike Marnula, both gone to the
NFL.

Junior Mark Hartsell leads the
way at QB, and returning to make
up his backfield are Omario
Walker and Justice Smith.

Blocking for all three will be

monster left tackle Pete Kendall
and his 6-4, 295—pound ﬂame .

Kendall, who’s on almost
everybody’s preseason All-.
America list, anchors an offensive
line that retums four of its starters.
Last year the Eagles outran their
opponents all but one time, and
they look to get more of that
blocking this year.

Walker and Smith have their
work cut out for them in the back-
ﬁeld, replacing David Green, who

’ ran for over 1,000 yards last year.

Smith ran for 708 yards last year.
and Walker lead the team with
nine touchdowns, all from inside‘
the five-yard line, forming as a
tough duo to beat. _

Hartsell, who threw for 1,864
yards last season, will be backed
up by sophomore Scott Mutryn.
Last year, Mutryn got the start
against Pitt and threw two touch-
downs in a 21-9 victory.

On the other side of the line BC
will have a top—notch pass defense
that will try to match last year’s
Big East-record 47 sacks.
Anchoring the unit will be senior

nose guard Tim Morabito, who

led the Big East last year with 18
tackles for losses.
Last year BC ﬁnished 7-4-1 in

The 1994 campaign for the

-West Virginia Mountaineers was ,

anything but ordinary. After a
shaky 1-4 start, including an
embarrassing 31-0 loss to
Nebraska, the Mountaineers
recovered to win six of their ﬁnal

seven games and earned a trip to
the Carquest Bowl. The
Mountaineers lost their magic and
fell " to the South Carolina
Gamecocks
24-21.
W l 9 9 5
looks to be a
V p r o m i s i n g
- year for Pitt’s
backyard
rival. Junior Chad Johnston
returns as the top returning starter
at quarterback in the Big East.
Johnston will be joined by an
experienced backfield, as well as
returning starters at the split end
and tight end positions. -
Senior tailback Robert Walke
returns after being hampered by a
bad ankle last season. He will look
to eclipse the school’s single-sea-
son rushing record he set back in
1993 when he gained 1,250 yards
on 2l4carries and scoredll
touchdowns. Leading the way for
Walker will be fullback Kentroy
Barber. At 6-3, 245, Barber has a
combination of sheer power and

excellent catching ability out of 

the backfield. Sophomore Leroy
White will also see action at full-
back.

Despite the loss of team MVP
Zach Abraham, the receiving
corps is dangerous again this sea-
son. Rashaan Vanterpool, a sec-
ond-team All-Big East selection
last season, returns to top his 50-
reception sophomore season.
Lovett Purnell is back at tight end

after starting all 13 games for the -

Mountaineers last year.

WVU coach Don Nelilen has a
long list of returners anchoring the
offensive line, including senior
tackles Joe DeLong and Chris
Klick, guard Buddy Hager and

centers Jay Brooks and Derrick T

Bell.

Juniors Mike Horn (6-5, 290),
Tom Habak (6-6, 290), Bryan
Washington (6-6, 305) and sopho-
more Bill McElroy (6-3, 280) are
all expected to see ample time.

The Mountaineers return six
defensive starters from the ‘94
season, when they had a plus-
seven turnover ratio and held Ball
State to a season-low 71 total
yards. ‘

NCAA interception leader
Aaron Beasley returns at comer-
back and will be joined by Mike
Logan. Logan struggled last year
after suffering a broken arm in the
season opener versus Nebraska.
He failed to learn his lesson and
rebroke his arm in a pick-up bas-
ketball game, forcing him to miss
spring practice. Juniors Charles
Emmanuel and Varrn Washington
will start at the safety positions. i

ing of a ll2—tackle 1994 season,
and junior Canute Curtis looks to
improve on his team-high eight
sacks.

Possibly the biggest loss from
last season was All—American
punter Todd Sauerbrun. Junior
Brian West will be the successor
at punter, while sophomore Bryan
Baumann returns as placekicker.

—Matt Grove

This year, the Pitt Panthers can
do one of two things: improve or
stay the same.

Several national publications
have picked Johnny Majors’ crew
to do the latter, matching last
year’s record of 3-8. ‘

Even if the Panthers’ record
stays the same, there’s no doubt

t ha t
Majors
will be
fielding
his best
talent

 

since his

retum two years ago.

Six offensive starters return,
including the Big East’s Offensive
Player of the Year, RB Billy West
(1,358 yards). West will have to
stay healthy, because backup
Chris Patton has a total of 142
yards in two years. ,

For the first time since Alex Van
Pelt, the quarterback position is
stable. John Ryan looks to be the
top signal-caller after stepping in
last year for Juco-transfer Sean
Fitzgerald Ryan threw for 1,294

yards with 14 TDs and six inter-
ceptions, and he completed 60.4
percent of his passes. Sophomore
Pete Gonzalez and redshirt fresh-
man Matt Lytle are second and
third on the depth chart. Fitzgerald
is out of the picture and is trying to
beat out Nate Cochran for punting
honors.

The receivers are led by

Dieuich Jells, who needs just 51
yards to become Pitt’s all—time
career receiving yardage leader.
Mark Butler will be back from a
shoulder injury that sidelined him
for the season after just three
games last season. Curtis
Anderson and TE Dell Seagraves
return as experienced targets for
Ryan.
The key trouble spot for the
Panthers is the offensive line.
Defensive linemen Matt Hosilyk
and Tim Robbins have switched
sides and will fight for starting
offensive tackle positions.

On defense, 23 letterrnen and
nine starters return for the
Panthers.

Leading the solid linebacking
corps is Butkus Award candidate
Tom Tumulty. He finished last
season second on the team with 82
tackles (42 solo), while nursing a
sore knee the last five games.
David Sumner switched from free

‘safety to OLB. Jon McCray and

Jason Chavis hold down the and-
dle.

Tom Bamdt was the only key
loss to the defensive line. Zatiti
Moody (6-2, 235), Mike Halapin
(6-5, 270) and Tyler Young (6-4,
275) are all seniors and all were
starters. The three combined for

said. “Hopefully, with effort
from everyone. we can get
comfortable with our identity
and rhythm.”

Overall, the team is anxious
to begin the season, especially
the Big East competition.

Once again, Connecticut and
Providence will bring it all to
the court against the Lady
Panthers. The emerging Seton

Hall is also likely to make

some waves.

The conference schedule
ends the weekend of Nov. 17,
with the Big East Tournament.
Ironically, it’s being held in
South Bend, the same site
where Pitt fell to the Irish in
the NCAAS.

The Lady Panthers, with less
than a week’s rest, will then
have to prepare for the Baden
Blowout in Long Beach, Calif.
Pitt will battle perennial pow-
ers Long Beach State and U.C.
Santa Barbara.

After that it is on to the
NCAAs

“We will run into some .

excellent competition late in
the year,” Alvear said. “All of
a sudden, the schedule ju
grew like a monster.” '

Soccer

Karwoski said.

In goal, just like last year, the
Panthers have two capable net-
minders. Last year’s starter,
Kirk Brodows, is gone, and he
took his solid 1.60 goals
against average with him.
Adam Spitzer, who was 2-1 in
10 games last season, will try
and regain the magic he had in
1992, his freshman campaign.
That year he went 12-4-1 with
a school-record 10 shutouts
and led Pitt to its first playoff
appearance since 1985.

Junior Chris Tedesco will
compete with Spitzer for the
starting nod throughout sum-
mer training camp, which
began last week.

“Chris is good and hopefully
he will push Adam,” Karwoski
said. “Were looking for Spitz
to come into his own this sea-
son.”

Defensively, the Panthers are
led by junior Mike Dyer. Dyer
came on to the team in 1993
and started all 17 games his
rookie season. He missed only
three starts last year, scoring
his first career goal and adding
five assists. Junior Brett
Stezoski did not miss a start
last year, and along with
sophomore Jason Piombino.
they add depth to Pitt’s back-
ﬁeld.

Karwoski doesn’t see the
added power to the schedule as
a roadblock toward the
Panthers return to the Big East
Championships in November.

“Those teams play on a great
level, but you’d rather play
good teams,” Karwoski said.

The Scarlet Knights will be
at Pitt Stadium on Oct. 13, and
the Fighting Irish come to
town on Oct. 22. The Panthers‘
home opener in Big East play
is on Sept. 29 against Boston
College. The regular season for
Pitt kicks off this Saturday at
Robert Morris College.

Although the Orangemen ﬁn-

S ished third in the Big East with a

4-3 record and 7-4 overall,
Syracuse’s senior-laden squad
squandered a huge opportunity to
be the conference’s elite team.
Now, those seniors are gone,
and with them, so went ‘Cuse’s
chances in the Big East. Head
coach Paul Pasqualoni said this is
a transitional year, which basically
means he’s expecting the Carrier
‘Dome to cave. Put bluntly, the
Orangemen are hurting. This year
should prove the toughest test for
Pasqualoni, who in the past four

‘years has compiled a 33-12-1

‘Cuse
lost 15 letter
winners, and
only returns
five offensive
and six defen-
sive starters.
VV1th all the voids, the biggest hole
is at quarterback. The departure of
ﬁrst team All-Big East QB Kevin
Mason leaves a wide open field.
The QB race is between last year’s
backup Keith Downing, who’s a
sophomore, and redshirt freshmen
Donovan McNabb and Kevin
Johnson. A

Last year ‘Cuse led the confer-
ence in rushing, but now the

 

A Orangemen will be without Kirby

Dar Dar, the Big East’s f1fth-lead-

_ ing rusher. Malcolm Thomas, who

split duties with Dar Dar and was
the seventh-leading rusher, will
assume full responsibility in the
backﬁeld. The lone star on this
squad‘ is senior -receiver Marvin
Harrison, who should vie for All-
American honors, if anyone can
get him the ball.

The only returning starter from
the defensive line is 6-foot-3, 232-
pounder Dave Rebar. The line-
backing core lost its gut and glue
with the graduation of six-year
starter Dan Conley. Conley’s heir

_ will be sophomore Antwaune
Ponds, who as a freshman com- A

piled 122 tackles, second-best on
the team. But on the whole, the
third-to-last defensive squad last
year, should be relinquishing
points by the minutes with all the
holes ithas to ﬁll.
—Sean Duncan

The Rutgers Scarlet Knights
come into the season with the dis-
mal memory of last year’s night-
mare finish still fresh on their
minds. At 5-3-1 they thought they
were headed for bowl land.
Instead they got beat by Virginia
Tech and Pitt to ﬁnish the season
sixth in the Big East. ,

The Knights will have a tough
time improving on that record,
despite returning 15 starters. The
inconsistency they showed last
year will be back this year, along

' with those starters.

The running game is solid, led
by Terrell Willis. Willis didn’t get

We’ve seen it in baseball and
hockey and we’re seeing it in
basketball. A few people in
charge see a small picture ﬁlled
with dollar signs, and they
don’t look at the big picture,
the one with fans.

Pitt should no longer tolerate
these scheduling screw ups.
First, they bought that garbage
that Penn State and Mr. Big 10
Joe Patemo “did not have any
room for Pitt.”

They found room to take a
trip to New Brunswick, N.J., to
play Rutgers this year. There’s
a tough game.

The Panthers are OUR foot-
ball team. They belong to the
students, the ones who go to
the game, the ones who buy the
hats and the ones who fork
over the tuition. The fans, even
the ones who don’t wear a shirt
in December, deserve a chance

i to go to what could be one of

the most exciting games of the
year.

The suits at ESPN and the
NCAA schedule-makers
should take a peek outside the
bubble they live in and get a
glimpse of what the fans really
want.

Chieffor The Pitt News.

Johnson totalled 622 yards on 34

receptions with ﬁve TDs last year._

He is joined by seniors Marc
Baxter (33 receptions, 589 yards)
and Tim Israel, who returns after
missing last year with knee
injuries. Sophomore Troy Kersey
logged 16 catches for 301 yards.
Junior Kedrick Whitehead and

. Kyle Benzio will battle to replace

departed P.J. Cook at tight end.
Last year’s numbers: Whitehead,
one reception; Benzio, none.

The offensive line is the most
stable part of the Owls’ attack. All
ﬁve starters return and have played
more than 600 snaps. Senior guard
John Summerday (6-2, 288)- is
predicted to be a top—round draft
choice and didn’t allow a sack all
last season.

Linebacker Lance Johnstone
led the team with 114 tackles. Of
his career 276 tackles, 191 have
been solo. Johnstone will be
helped by Alabama transfer Willie
Brown and Alshermond
Singleton. who led the conference
with ﬁve forced fumbles.

One of two returning starters in
the secondary is senior CB Allan
Jackson. He started every game
last year, and he intercepted three
passes and deﬂected 10.

improve much in terms of its

August 28 1995

 

Reminiscent of the Nazi
regime’s labeling of some art as
“degenerate,” the U.S. House of
Representatives recently voted
that the National Endowment for
the Arts budget for the upcom-
ing fiscal year be limited to $99
million, while the Senate voted
for $110 million, compared to
this year's budget of $167.4 mil-
lion. According to Time maga-
zine, the American government
currently spends 0.05 percent of
this nation’s budget on all forms
of all cultural subsidy per year.
This Congressional motion will
not take a noticeable chunk out
of our growing budget deficit,
but instead is a giant leap
towards the elimination of feder-
al arts funding in America. Ol’
‘ Newt seems to be using the bal-
anced budget as a smoke
screen to eventually furnish big
business with corporate censure
of the arts.

The NEA creates jobs and
introduces the arts and creative
expression to millions of school
children. It funds inner-city arts
programs and many young film
makers’ and dramatists’ projects
that might be too risky for some
private investors to undertake.
Contrary to Congressional
_ assumption, this is a program
invested with family values. So
is the Contract With America
really a Contract on America's
Youth, or are the men/women of
our current Congress just too
removed from the taxpayers
they represent?

“This is a serious, substantial

 voxsP£K G  

cut that will affect every arts pro-
gram across the country," said
Kelly Sullivan of the NEA.

How will it affect Pittsburgh?‘
Keeping in mind the practical
impossibility of an arts organiza-
tion to rely solely on generated
revenue alone, let's take theater
as an example.

The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
will survive because it remains
dependent primarily on endow-
ments, but the City and Public
Theaters both receive grants
from the NEA. According to City
Theater Art Director of
Development, Karla Boos. the
significant amount of funding
thatthey receive from the NEA
is through the Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts. Therefore,
through a trickle-down effect,
their funding will be considerably
cut.

Saul Straussman, Managing
Director of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival who also
once worked for the NEA, pre-
dicts that the larger companies
will only feel a pinch. Smaller
companies too, will survive
because they are used to deal-
ing with miniscule budgets from
the state. However, the mid-size
companies just beginning to
expand will be the hardest hit.

“An NEA grant is like a seal of
approval. Peers feel your work
has a certain validity,” explained
Straussman. “Then when you go
back to local (supporters) there
is an air of legitimacy. Mid-size
companies will either have to
really scale back, or fold up their
tent.”

 

The budgets have been set
for most companies’ ‘95-‘96 sea-
son, but look for changes in
September of ‘96. If Congress’s
proposal is put into law, the arts
will be even less accessible to
the poor and middle America.
These decisions by Congress
are completely contradictory to
the reasons — see Bill ofPights
— this country was founded.
Why are they sending the mes-
sage that free expression has to
be limited to talk shows and
‘HBO?

The numbers reached by the
two branches are now in the
process of becoming reconciled
and and put into a Conference
Report, which the President has
the option to veto. This down-
ward spiral of funding for arts in
a democracy can only be curbed
by approving Clinton’s plan for a
‘96 NEA budget of $172.4 mil-
lion. E—mail Congress using the
central address for government
information pages
http://www.alw.nih.gov/govt.html
— and the information you
reach will tell you how to contact
the legislative branch.

It scares me that the people of
Germany during the 1930s did
not see the stifling and censure
of their arts development com-
ing and that therein lies the pos-
sibility for history to repeat itself.
You vote (or should) to put rep-
resentatives in office. Let them
know that if they threaten us tax-
payers with a country without
free expression, we can take our
votes back.

Well, indie rock IS certainly a
big deal as of late. Everybody’s
talking about vinyl and wearing
gas station jackets and sporting
short, snappy haircuts.
Mainstream media is having a
field day — grunge out-lived any
me‘aTn‘ing and lost it's head-tum-
ing abilities. The major-label
music business is pushing indie

The Trio have just been

 signed to Merge Recordsll The

them as a cross between Unrest

only one KHT. Watch then play :

“Your Damned lmpertinence"
and see what I mean. Karl

keeps the beat snappy, while

got style, attitude and chops!

William Pitt Union, there is a place of great
mystery and romance; a place with a
grand history and a starry destiny; a place
where the golden joyful noises of musical
legends and the newest kids on the block

-9 are trumpeted proudly across our great
city.

It is a radio station. Its name is WPTS.

“We have a radio station? Huh. I didn't
know that." Yes Pittsters, believe it or not,
we have our very own chunk of airwaves
at 92.1 FM. Both an entertainment bulwark
and a Pittsburgh best-kept-secret, WPTS
is a laboratory, classroom and playground
for Pitt students to create and the commu-
nity to enjoy.

WPTS has a long, complicated history

that dates back to 1957. In that year, the
Student Broadcasting Association, led by
Adrien Cronauer of “Good Morning
Vietnam” fame, first proposed the idea of a
campus radio station to the Pitt administra-
tion. On February 9, 1959, WPGH-AM was
to have its first broadcast throughout the
Pitt Student Union and dormitories. The
switch was flipped and — SURPRISE! —
all the lights were blown out in Schenley
Hall. .
‘ To make a long story a short, WPGH
finally went on the air in 1961 at 820 AM,
then switched to 640 AM in 1966. In 1977,
‘PGH and the Student Government Board
started working toward moving to the FM
dial. There was much protest from the
other stations with which Pitt's station
would share the non-commercial band'(91
FM and below). So Pitt requested a space
on the commercial band. The FCC was
eventually convinced, and WPTS went on
the air at 98.5 FM at 6 pm, August 26,
1984.

In 1992, when a local commercial sta-
tion increased its wattage and complained
of interference with WPTS, the FCC
requested that the station move again.
WPTS moved to 92.1 FM on August 3,
1994. This brings us to the present home
of our nomadic station.

In the lofty heights of our beloved.

Radio Goo-Goo, Radio Dada

stephanie alarcon deconstructs 92.1-FM. WPTS

Spinnin’ Records, Fightin’ Windmills

Call it a concept station. Well, no, don't,»

because someone will kick you in the head
for being pretentious. It's more of a chaot-
ic, Quixotic ideal pursued by a ragtag col-
lection of Sanchos. PTS's musical mis-
sionaries sally forth against the corporate
windmill of crappy assembly-line music
and the honorless Cretans who shove it
down the throats of the innocent towns-
people——er, media-consuming public. And
they do it all while shyly standing around
pigeon-toed, gazing at their shoes.

The idea of ‘PTS, and of any college
radio station worth its place on the dial, is
to play music, expose ideas and flirt with
creativity that wouldn't stand an idealist'S
chance in politics on “normal" radio.
Freedom from the noose of parent sta-
tions, advertisers, and just about everyone
but the Federal Communications
Commission (grumble grumble) gives pub-
lic and college radio stations the freedom
to run programs that wouldn't necessarily
have mass appeal. Thus, there is an outlet
for local, underground, obscure, unusual
or cutting-edge music and ideas. The non-
commercialband is a small strip of the FM
band where capitalism gets derobed, and
we all know the emperor's only wearing
his skivvies.

Therein lies that sensitive, militant spot
in the college radio mentality that some
denounce as exclusionary, even elitist.
Once in a while ya get ta feeling like the
whole world is run by people who want to
shove a product down your subliminal
throat until you start thinking you actually
want what they're selling. You can't
escape. It's enough ta make a gal a little
pissed. Some people respond by defaming
billboards, some by swearing off TV.
Others roar mightily and threaten to dis-
embowel you if you call during their shows
and request Pearl Jam or Rusted Root.

‘‘I don’t think it's college radio's responsi-
bility to play major label releases", said
secretary and DJ extraordinaire, Craig
Seder. “That’s why, when you turn on

WPTS, it's good that you're scared."

However, college radio is much more
than angsty yalps from card-carrying
members of the “l-Took-lntro-To-Mass-
Communication-Process-And-l-Feel-
victimized Club". Part of the charm is find-'
ing something to relate to, be it a “lo-ti",
sensitive, indie-rock song that you could
have written yourself, or a musician from
halfway across the globe who, for whatev-
er reason, strikes that unique, goose-
bumpy chord in you for the first time.

The sheer availability of the airwaves
(access to non-mainstream media, for you
Intro to Mass Comm Process vultures) to
any old schmuck who applies and gets in,
is liberating in itself. Some college radio
stations are not even run by the students
at the school. WDUQ from Duquesne
University, for example, is an excellent

-jazz station. However, most of the people

that you hear on the air are professionals,
not students.

But stations like ‘PTS and WRCT from
Carnegie Mellon University (also an excel-
lent station) are more free form and open
to the student body. Your resume can be
empty and your major can have nothing to
do with communications, but when the
public surfs the FM stations. they could
hear yourvoice just as easily as any flashy
WDVE-meister’s. How‘s that for a powe'
trip?

Don, Tell Them What They've Won.

But wait! There’s more  ‘PTS is fun. it
the last five loquacious paragraphs of two-
bit mass media theory and insider
pedantry have made you gnash your teeth
and screech, “l DON'T GIVE A FUCK!".
never fear. ‘PTS is still the station for you.
Flip on the radio any Friday night for
‘PTS's legendary rap shows and you feel
like you just got let in on the best party of

the year. Listen for random mock poetry ,

by Father Mike, Pittsburgh’s own "punk
rock priest". and hear enthralling tales of
light-bulb changing and bears with
chapped asses. Hear DJs talk their way
out of screw—ups like playing records at the
wrong speed. Not that it's always an acci-
dent. There have been interviews with Jan
Brady. God and several DJs‘ friends. And-
are there any other offices in Pitt where

Recognize the real for those
that know! For those that don’t,
I'll be more than glad to intro-
duce myself. l’m Blakk Steel,
Rap Music Director of WPTS
92.1 FM (Fri. 9-11pm). l’m also
lead host of Underground Hip
Hop Video Magazine (Mon. at
11pm on PCTV cable channel.
21 -— cable-ready B-side chan-
nel 7). it’s a critically acclaimed
R-rated video show that runs on
Pittsburgh public access chan-
nel and also in Manhattan!
‘Uncensored videos when made
available (unedited vocals and
sometimes body parts!) provide
for an entertaining hour of music
and other things. From time to
time, I write this weekly column
that I like to call Diggin’ In Tha‘
Crates. In it, I give record

"reviews from an underground

DJ’s objective standpoint
(meaning, if something is phat,
no matter what my personal
feelings for the artist(s) are, they
receive their proper respect). I
use a five-point system to rate
albums. The system is as fol-
lows: '

@@@@@ - IT’S ALL GOOD,
Baby Baby!!!

@ @ @ @ - IT'S The Phazznatll
@@@ _- IT'S I-Ight.

@ @
Suspect!
@ - Get The Dillznick!!!

(The symbols are supposed to .

be headphones, but this’ll have
to do.)

I also DJ the majority of the
parties on campus (when orga-
nizations choose not to be
cheap). My love of music is raw,
underground, East Coast hip '
hop beats; but I play what the
audience likes when I spin the
parties (which tends to be a lot
more commercial).

Right about now, it’s time to.
get my thing in action and start
the reviews.

Diggin’ in the Crates

with blakk steel

You know the
click, or should! say the I
Clan. ‘The Wu Tang Clan
housed the scene like crack took
over the ghetto. The platinum
debut paved the way for a lot of
solo efforts. The Method Man
(Johnny Blaze, Tical, etc.) was
the first with Tical; this album
proved that platinum is the metal
of choice for the Wu. Ol’ Dirty
Bastard dropped an odd-colored
jewel entitled Return To The 36
Chambers: The Dirty Version’.
Although it’s only gold for the
moment, the legacy was well
continued. Now it’s Chef and
Ghost’s time to shine, with the
Genius and the entire Wu ‘fol-
lowing shortly,

Chef and Ghost’s album con-

. tains jewels that the lost dutch-

man would be happy_to find.
“Knowledge God” is reminis-

c e n t
of Nas’ “One Love” in the
respect that it sounds like a letter
or message to one of his peeps
on lockdown. The track has an
odd but buttah appeal with the
music line that sounds like it

came from a Japanese soap

opera.“lncarcerated Scarfaces”
highlights Rae rippin’ it clean
with no breaks over a sparse but
wicked drumtrack.
“Criminology" (first single)
drops lovely with atrack that's a
mixture of 1970s blaxploitation
movies and sheer confusion;
with Chef and Ghost tossing
their unique blends into the pot,
the ‘chemistry is complete. “Ice
Cream” has Method Man
(Johnny Blaze) and a new kid
named Cappachino joining the

     

duo
over a
piano line
' that sounds like some
0!’ ‘As The -World Turns’ type of
shit; it’s buttah! “Wu Gambinos”
puts Blaze, RZA (Bobby Steels)
and Master Killa (Noodles) in the
mix over a track that sounds like
it could've been on the first Wu
album. Standouts have to be
“Guillotine” with lnspektah Deck
(Rollie Fingers) and The Genius
teaming up with the two-man tag
team to shred one of the phat-
test tracks of all times. it’s verbal
kung fu meets music; it’s the
illest. “Verbal Intercourse” has

\a Clan outsider (Nas aka Nas

Escobar) upping the ante to
those that wish to dabble in
wordplay. With its sparse track, it
points the focus to the lyrics.
And, of course, “Glaciers Of
Ice” (the current video and B-
side of first single); you already

- know about this one. The music

 

that sounds like it came from a
video game hits you repeatedly.
As a whole, the album-is on
tight. One of the biggest strong
points is that this album is not
reliant on hooks to get it over; it’s
just straight Parkay.

With almost every album,
there are a few problems; this
one is no exception. The main
problem is the excessive talking.

For what I spent on vinyl and

CD, I didn't want to hear them
talking about dye shorts and shit
different colors for summer. Or
about a whole bunch of people I
don’t know and probably aren't
known out of their respected
areas. With the exception of
“Shark Niggas” (which is dissin’
a well loved rap artist - l’m not
saying until they do),.the conver-
sations are needless. Musically,
the only lowpolnts are “Rainy
Dayz” and “North Star” (you
have to have the CD to hear
this).

With this album, they join
Clanmate Ol’ Dirty Bastard and
friends Mobb Deep ashaving
one the best_ albums of the year.
Only Built... definitely continues
the Wu saga.

(Reality) Checking the local scene

 

Sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll
have stimulated erotic behavior
since Jesus was a boy. But late-
ly the Rock ‘n’ Roll bit has been
increasingly hard to come by. if
you're interested in seeing a
band in our ripe young city you
will most likely find yourself at a
bar or club, and if you are under
21 you may find yourself missing
out on some good shows. There
have been some ups and downs
in the live music scene that
some may find significant.

The venue known as the
“home of Rock ‘n’ Roll and the
Crib ofthe Blues” was deep-
sixed a week ago, sold to an

-entrepreneur with Mexican food

on the brain. The Decade is
gone, and with itnthe rock n’ roll
we love to hate has been dis-
placed by one Senor Froggy’s.
The Decade, famous‘ for it’s
over-21 local and national acts,
hosted bands ranging and rag-

ing from the Red Hot Chili
Peppers to the Nixon Clocks. it
was a cold day in August when
this Oakland room packed up its
last amp. ’

Another recent loss came with
the transformation of what used
to be called the Artery. Now
called Planet Earth, featuring
global cuisine, it was once a
place to hear great bands featur-
ing poor sound. Regardless of
the crowded room and poor
acoustics, it was still a place you
could count on for some exciting
sweat-crazed shows. Here we
could once gather to hear
bands, view art and drink until
the dreaded last call.

These places will just have to
go down on the list with the
other places which have locked
out Pittsburgh's musicians.
There was a time when you
could smash your head to a
cock-rock band at the Upstage
or enjoy a caffeine high while
checking a band at the Beehive.
Future groupies will probably
say something similar about
what used to go down at the

, restaurants which took the place

of our local rock houses.
Fortunately, larger venues
such as Graffiti, Bloomfield
Bridge Tavern, Metropol, Nick's
Fat City and Rosebud still have
their doors open for band busi-

you may or may not have to be
over 21 to attend. But, more
importantly, if a band can't bring
in the masses to fill the room,
they may end up having to pay to
play the club.

some fabulous bands, some of
which have done well for them-
selves and moved on. Supporting
them is both fun for the audiences
and necessary for the band’s sur-
vival. Keep in touch with where
your favorites are debuting and
don't neglect them. Keep in mind
that “lt's all Good!”

It was the great Beehive
Summer of ‘92. Inexpensive, all-
ages shows werebeing put on
several times a week upstairs at
the Oakland coffeehouse. This
was the Pre-Yuppie Facelift era
Beehive, and who cares if all the
"art on the walls was embarrass-
ingly ugly; what about the street-
whacks? The fre_aks always
need a place to hang and Ioiter,
even if it ain’t good for business.

Anyway, one evening I
checked out a band from

Munhall's noise-artis
noise-artists, Blunde
made it look. I saw three guys
rip through some 'fiercely
aggressive, feedback-laden
jams that night. The guitarist
screamed undecipherably

the end of the set, the
drummer, who looked like
across between Dave Grohl
and Dana Och, dove through his
drum kit, and if I remember cor-
rectly, his nighttime shades
remained on throughout. I
bought their 7" as soon as it
was over. ‘

Records signed them the follow-
ing year and they put out the
“Road to Arizona” 7". They
recorded nine songs in Detroit
for Conspiracy, engineered by
Matt King at White Room
Studios. 8

I talked to Bill and Jim one
night over a few cans of Jacobs
Best. Unfortunately, guitarist
and singer (a task shared with
Nemeth) Ben Matthews refuses
to give interviews and instead
issued a single written state-
ment: “Blunderbuss Declares
War on Every Mind, Ear, and
Heart on the Planet.” Actually,
he had to help his mom with
something. ,

Bill and Jim say that they
played hardcore music as a
four-piece band when they first
started out, at the tender age of
sixteen. I bring up Unsane.

“Actually, we didn’t even know
who Unsane were when we first
started. We just hated how
Ben's voice sounded, so we put
some distortion on it,” says Bill,
who lists old XTC, The Beatles
and Roxy music as a few of his
influences.

Jim says that he hates being
stereotyped. “Fuck that record,”
he said at the Conspiracy record
release party earlier this sum-
mer.

‘‘I just want to go and play as
many places as we can, and put
out another record.”

One moment Bill nods his
head in agreement. A minute
later he says, ‘‘I don’t want to go
anywhere. I just want to put out

another record.”
“We want to go down in histo-

 ry,” says Jim.
I get the feeling that BiI|.won’t ‘

really mind that much when the
band does hit the road later this
year. They recently bought a
van in preparation for just such
an occasion.

The band received letters

from as far away as Germany in~

response to their Homestead
single, which is cool with these
QUYS- .

“lt’s nice to know that people
notice it. because every record
we've put out has been pretty
half-assed,” says Baxter in his

Since the beginning of the
‘90s, when “Alternative” music
started to become the main-
stream, and MTV and the record
label moguls began to realize the
capitalistic potential that inde-
pendently made music had, the
American music scene has
quickly been wrapped into a nau-
seating tension: the race to be
involved. Since it is now possi-
ble, once again, to be a musician
and gain semi-widespread
recognition fairly easily, the mod-
ern music world has become a
marathon of participation, with
bands and genres vying for lis-
teners and styles, changing like
the weather all along. It is a
scene mostly of instant gratifica-
tion, a lack of stylistic aesthetic
and mass communication/mar-
keting. ’

Deep within the bowels of this
music world lies it's Caliban, the
buried curmudgeon of

independent music, the oft-
ignored realm of Gothic/Ethereal
music. Over the 15 years in
which Dark Ethereal, or Gothic, '

W/Z0/‘d5 0/‘ gbfﬂ

music (whatever you wish to call
it) has existed, it has gone
through many guises —— from the
seminal melodramatic punk of
Bauhaus, to the dark dances of
Sisters of Mercy and Skinny
Puppy, to the pop of Lush, and
finally the most artistically suc-
cessful soundscapes of His
Name is Alive or  And Also the
Trees. '

In the Northeast of America,
Dark Ethereal music has evolved
into a shade of the last style, an
esoteric scene of musicians
whose dedication to the music
defies the new pop-culture impe-
rialism. The musicians know
what they want to do, and they
do it —— recognition be damned.

One of the focal points of this
scene is the Washington D.C.
record label Bedazzled, who
have just released their new
compilation album Wake Up
Smiling, containing one track
each from such household
names as Mistle Thrush, Siddal,
Where I Wake Warm andthe
Pittsburgh-based group
Underflowers. The compilation

   

   
     
 

proves a diversity among the
groups while maintaining a unity
of artistic expression, a map of
territory to cover. While Gothic
music is often pegged as
“depressing,” none of the music
on Wake Up Smiling is truly
dragging and most of it is, in
fact, uplifting. Where some see
the slow, ambient music, devoid
of guitar licks and fevered
squealing, as being depressing,
a listen to these new groups will
show a spectrum of artists
enthralled by their surroundings,
in awe of the world around
them, and attempting to both
cope with, and communicate,
that awe

Underflowers, Pittsburgh’s
contribution to Bedazzled’s field,
are one of the best purveyors of
this ethereal, yet powerful
music. With a stripped-down
lineup of two voices (Mia Chesla

 

and J Orazi), acoustic guitar
(Orazi), electric guitar (Dave
Wallace) and violin (Tanya
Kavalkovich), Underflowers’
music evokes a more primitive
emotion than many of the other
groups on Bedazzled. While still
using many of the reference
points of Gothic style, they add
pagan and baroque elements to
the music, creating a sound
which is reminiscent at once of
Dead Can Dance and Barrett-
era Pink Floyd.

Underflowers’ recordings are
conceptual pieces, completely
self-executed under the direc-
tion of one-time professional
studio engineer Orazi. Using all
the possible sounds they can
extract from their instruments
and from the soundscapes
which they encounter in their
lives, the group. creates music
ranging from serene to violent,
moods from ancient to post-
modern.

In concert, Underflowers are
artists and professionals
through and through. From their
appearance on stage, to the
perfect aura of sound which
they produce, the group main-
tains an aesthetic of purpose,
an overall continuity which

makes each of their perfor-
mances an intact, complete
work, and not simply another
aspect of some pop-culture net-
work. They are well on their way
to being a completely self-con-
tained artistic unit, a goal which
too few musicians even strive
for, nonetheless reach.

This genre of music is one
which is. rarely talked‘ of in
Pittsburgh, though many people

,in town appreciate it, as the

attendance at one of
Underflowers sporadic local
appearances will show. For this
reason, it should be quite a
worthwhile event when Cloud 9
in the Strip District hosts a
release party for the Wake Up
Smiling compilation, featuring
Underflowers, D.C.’s shimmer-
ing, ethereal group Siddal and
New York City’s poppier Where
I- Wake Warm, on September
7th. ' -
Underflowers, Siddal and
Where I Wake Warm appear at
Cloud 9 on Thursday,
September 7. Underflowers’
se/f-titled CD should be out mid-
October, and the Woke Up
Smiling compilation is out now.

rating: @@@

With the first volume breaking
barriers in music, this series was
something missing in all forms of
Black music: unity. By bringing
together jazz, blues, reggae,
R&B, funk and rap artists, this
album was to appeal to every-
one. The thought itself in theory
is fine. but with that, you have to

-include two very important ingre-

dients: phatness and flavor.

I’m not saying the album is
totally lackluster; but it is missing
something. “Respect The
Architect” has Guru and
Bahamadiah (whom I believe is
his best find and represents
Philly at its finest) mixing it up
over a glazed track droppin’
nuggets for the cerebellum.
“Watch What You Say” tosses
Chaka Khan in this piece to
bring back that soul tlava over a
smooth and unusual track; it
works lovely. Hands down, the
phattest has to be “Medicine”,
where he teams up with lni
Kamoze over a barebones hip-
hop Mark Spark track. They
accent each other very well to
provide a buttah joint that should
be the next single. Other stand-
outs include “For You”, “Lost
Souls” and “Nobody Knows.”

As l stated before, something
is missing. I can’t put my finger
on it, but I can point out a couple
of things. Throughout this
album, Guru tends to sound
sleepier than usual. The monot-
ones don’t mix with the tracks,
therefore creating a monotonous
and boring mixture. With the
plethera of guest stars and the,
reputations that proceed them,
there is no way this album
should be like it is. Also, some of
the tracks are just plain wack. A
good house has to be built on a
strong foundation; this founda-
tion is kinda weak.

Jazzmatazz /I brings a new
perspective to the listener. This
means how you see this album
is left totally up to you.

The Starting 5 Singles from
the Crate this time are:

1. Das Efx - “Real Hip Hop”

2. RBX - “AWOL”

3. Kool G. Rap - ‘‘It’s A
Shame”

4. Redman/Method Man -
“How High”

5. Onyx - “A Walk In New
York”

Next time, I'll be bringing you
more of the phattest in the world
of Hip Hop music as I continue
to dig in  you know the rest!
Until next time  u

you could expect to hear the
anguished cry of, “Don’t spank
me!’’? It's parefor the course at
our dear station.

People visit WPTS to hang
out, eat lunch, read, make
futile attempts at getting work
done, take naps, fraternize
with the locals or drink a darn
good cup of coffee courtesy of
S zder. “We pride ourselves on
always having flavored cream-
er," he said. And how is this
creamer gleaned? “I go down
to the 7-11' and scam it. I don’t
even get reimbursed for it.
That’s how much I care.”

People listen to ‘PTS
because there is a lot to listen
to. There are ‘PTS traditions
like Punk Rock Saturday
Night, the award-winning rap

Metal Zone on weekend after-
noons, and the “love it or hate
it” Mad Mike show. ‘PTS has
shows specializing in jazz,
house, 1960s garage punk,
Canadian “goodies”, world
music, ska, oldiesf Frank
Zappa and local band music.
There are weekday news

 
  

’ assistant adds a little bit of a

‘ program announcements in
shows on Friday nights, The .

broadcasts, a sports call-in
show and The Queer Journal.

‘PTS also works closely with
local bands and promoters to
keep listeners up to date on
what’s going on in the city. If
yer lucky, you might even get
a shot at some free tickets,
wink wink,- nudge nudge.

Best ofall, new shows pop
up all the time. Each new DJ,
writer, engineer, intern, or

new angle to the station. New
ideas are welcome and
encouraged, as well as new

‘‘I’d be happy just putting out

life."

The members of Blunderbuss
are totally supportive members

of Pittsburgh’s rock community.-

No local rock show would be
complete without the presence
of Bill Baxter, with his usual
backpack full of Iron City six-
teen-ouncers. He also pounds
the skins for local heavies Six
Horse, featuring Pat from the
now defunct Northern Bushmen,
and indie popsters Final lris Co.
Parties at Jim’s house in
Duquesne have been the sight
of many truly inspired and chaot-
ic performances by local bands
this summer. _

Rhythm reigns supreme on
Conspiracy. Melodic bass hooks
combined with rock-solid drum-
ming lay the foundation for Ben
Matthews triumphantly elevating,
solo-laden, yet crunchy guitar
playing, which is, I suspect, what
draws in the Legions of
Dedicated Fans at Each and
Every Show. Much like Led
Zeppelin (or any great rock
band), each element is integral
to the beauty and power of the
music. ' .

At their most melodic,
Blunderbuss today reminds me
of a heavier version of old
Dinosaur, but with more slam-

  

att ews,
min’ drums. Baxter sure knows
the importance of his cymbals.
Lyrically, Nemeth and Matthews
pretty much stick to exploration
of loss and regret, and then, of
course, there is rage. Jim
describes it as “that lowdown
feeling”, which he believes is
getting old.

“Ben just sits in his room too
much, that’s his problem," says
Bill.

There is one unexpected twist
on Conspiracy, which is Manny
Theiner’s piano coda to “Decree
of the Comet”. Otherwise, this
record pretty much represents
the live Blundebuss experience
accurately, with the added
attraction of vocals a bit louder in
the mix. I was glad to hear new
recordings of Blunderbuss clas-
sics like ‘‘Black Stump and

axter and Nemeth drive the Blunderbuss.

  
 

Crooked Mick”.

Conspiracy. instills a sense of
good old self-righteousness in
the listener, as does all great
rock ‘n roll, without having to
think too much or feel guilty
about it. In fact, Blunderbuss is
one of the last bands in the

  
   

world that should be being writ- .

ten about, because they’re so
much more fun to listen to. They
are to be counted among the vic-
tors in the war between pure
expression and fashionable _bull-
shit. Buy their record immedi-
ately, because you’re a con-
sumer and you want to be hip.
And if you don’t like it, Sonny, I'll
bet your cousin, the burnout who
listens to AC/DC, will. Trade it to
him for a bag, and the world will
improve just that much. -
