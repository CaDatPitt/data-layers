 Is Coming . . .’

Poet, playwright, and writer Leroi Jones spoke at T. S 
the University Wednesday as a part of the Black Week , ‘
celebration. ’

In his speech, Jones lashed out at prejudice and
white racism. He urged blacks to unite behind their
culture. He spoke out against black men who» tried _
to become white. He mentioned two kinds of'Afro-
Americans, Negroes and Blacks. Negroes identify with,‘
white America while blacks recognize their African".
origins.   ,

Jones analyzed white hatred and exploitation’ of
blacks that has existed in America for the la st 4OOl7i

, years. He called the collective white man a “rapist_’-’~
and “lyncher.” He citedvwhite ownership of the busi-f.
nesses and institutions that blacks must deal with-—'j
every day of their lives. A A A A

At no time did he mention “integration.” 

An in-depth analysisnof the Jones speech and the; ;
entire Black Week will appear next week. ' ‘-

American Legion Still    

Fighting University

The Pennsylvania American Legion has reported that it has re-
ceived a number of replies from the leaders of the Pennsylvania Leg- _ ‘g .1:
islature favoring the resolution of its Departmental Executive Jan. — r
18, that the “failure to reinstate credits. for ROTC by the University. V

of Pittsburgh should result in_the
withholding of state financial as-
sistance to the institution.”

The Honorable Joseph V. Zord,
Jr., a membefof the Pennsyl-

vania House of Representatives.

stated: “‘In my opinion, all State
Aid to this University should be
stopped until the administra-
tors decide that the University of
Pittsburgh will be an institution
of higher learning for all students
who obey rules and regulations.”

He continued, “We must im-
press f upon the administration
that the majority of students
want to receive an education and
we cannot condone the actions of
a minority who wish to overthrow
the American principles.”

In one of its editorials attack-
ing the Legion’s stand, The Pitt
News in its Feb. 3, 1969 edition,
referred to “that majority of
half-wits the Pennsylvania State
Legislature.” This information,
as well as other editorials, was
forwarded by the Pennsylvania

Legion‘ to all State Legislators.

To this, John E. Gilbert re-
sponded, “The name-calling, such
as ‘motherhood-ish, super-patri-
otic,- anti—intellectual and pow-
erful American Legion’ shall
not in any way divert us from
our stand on this matter.” He‘
continued, “We can fight mili-
tancy with militancy, if need be,
where the defense of Our Nation
is at stake.”

“As in all the recent disrup-
tions of college life,’’ -Gilbert
said, “the demands are ‘we want
it because we want it,’ with no
reasoning whatsoever.”

'Mr., Gilbert concluded, “It -is

obviously * just anotherjw,ay- to__

About Hubert Humphrey, the
TV monitor said, “He’s a dead
duck. He should have had the elec-
tion but he blew it. He's like
taking a high dive into a jar of
echhh!!!!”

Susskind believes that politi-
cians turn out to be the worst
guests. According to him it is
their mission in life to only make
“non-statements.” As an exam-
ple he gave Adlai Stevenson. Be-
fore interviewing Stevenson, Da-
vid Susskind always placed him
in the position of a hero. How-
ever, during the interview, Ste-
venson seemed to evade every is-
sue that was presented to him.

Recalling the\ early days in
1958 when “Open End” was a live

show in which nothing was cen- 
sored Susskind talked about Nor- ‘

man Mailer. Said Susskind, “Af-
ter calling Eisenhower a whore,
Mailer proceeded to explain that
he has _just recently been disin-
vited from appearing on another
television program because he
was going to talk about orgasms
— so I had to immediately break
in with a ‘good night folks.’’’

The discovery. of

The highlight of Susskind’s
speech was an account of his in-
terview with Nikita Khruschev
Oct. 4, 1960. Since Khruschev
was not allowed to leave New
York, the show was taped from
from the U.N. building. Prior to
the show. however. the sponsors
wanted affidavits of Susskind‘s
good citizenship etc. and final-
ly cancelled sponsorship altogeth-
er. Unwittingly, the space was
filled by adds to Radio Free Eu-
rope which showed Khruschev
smashing the heads of babies
and other equally gross pictures.

Said Susskind, “Since Khrus-
chev had ordered the monitors
to be taken out of the interview
room, we didn’t find out until
later what was actually happen-
ing during ‘station identifica-
tion.”

Iii spite of difficulties, the in-
terview ended well. Relates Suss-
kind, “When he started to leave.
he invited me to his country to
see ' a ‘true democracy.’ All I
could think of was, ‘he’s hugging
me coast to coast!” I was careful
to keep my arms down at my
sides like a reluctant virgin how-

Susskind concluded his lecture
by encouraging students to get
into television instead of com-
plaining about it. He emphasized
that if students really wanted to
see television ‘become a more ef-
fective medium they should think
about becoming writers and pro-
ducers. They shouln’t despair

Speech

Hecklers ‘Sneak—Up’ '0
On TV Personality    

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Feature Writer

“It’s the condition of the young to be angry,” commented

David Susskind after his Wednesday speech. And, to the dis-
pleasure of the audience Susskind’s speech had been repeatedly inter-  if

rupted by hecklers “embarrassed” that the Student Union Board had. I

spent $2,000 for a teller of stories.

Susskind explained that the light
speech was decided upon be-
cause such speakers as Nat Hent-
off. James Farmer, John Kenneth
Galbraith, Leroi Jones, and Dr.
Benjamin Spock have and will pro-
vide the University student body
with a confrontation with major
issues.

Paul Hensler a member of the
SUB Public Affairs committee
pointed out later that his commit-
tee which chooses speakers js pre-
sently looking for new menbers.
If a segment of the student body
is unhappy with the speakers and
speech selection they have the op-
portunity to apply for member-
ship on the committee rather than
depend on de facto protests.

Put on the spot by the crude

demand of the hecklers that he turn‘

over his fee to set up‘ a David Sus-
skind scholarship for black stu-

' dents, Susskind brilliantly put the

hecklers on thedefensive ending
with a reference to the hairy heck-
lers, “God I hope my daughter
doesn't marry one!”

As Susskind’s entertaining and
generally well received speech

.came to an end. the famous movie

and television producer turned
to face the issues. In a question
and answer period, a news con-
ference and a bull session (more
politely termed a reception) in
the SU ballroom, Susskind gave
his opinions on various important
issues.

He seemed remarkably in tune
with student thinking as he was
surrounded by some 200 students
for the 21/2-hour session. Calling
for reforms in abortion, welfare,
draft, and divorce laws, Susskind
told the students that he has
tried marijuana and found it to
give a “Hell of a sensation — in-
stant drunk.” .

On the basis of experts he has
interviewed, Susskind believed
marijuana should be legalized.

However, he warned that changes
must come through the system.

tion soon to be under 25 years of
age, Susskind urged students t‘o.use

their “political muscle” and de- “
plored campus violence.

Referring to Sen. Flemming’s

"proposals and similar one’s in

other states, Susskind warned
“blacklash against students is
one of the dangers of excessive
protest.”
of FBI agents on campus, and,

when asked if ROTC should be ac- 
credited, commented “Hell no, ' ,
You should do what Harvard did I

throw them out.”

Susskind declared that the

blacks need material advancement‘

and this depends on white help.
He considered the tendency for
blacks to disengage and form their
identity sophomoric and silly.”

Susskind also admitted that he
supportsdraft resistors who're- .

fuse to serve in the “ghastly” war

in Vietnam. Comenting, "‘I would A

not be able to fight in this war.”
The ballroom bull session fea-

tured a discussion between Josh 
Chasan, a leader of the hecklers, 
and Susskind. From an initial mu- . ‘

tual dislike over the issue of

the “Susskind scholarship,” the 

University history teaching fellow

moved into a friendly and de- » 
cisive dialogue with the televis- v
ion personality. At one point,: 

after apologizing for the earlier

strategy, refering to what Suss- ‘

kind had retorted earlier in the
evening; lfhasan asked Susskind,

“You mean I can marry your A 
daughter now?” In mock despera- . 

tion Susskind, who was there
at the expense of his dinner, re-

plied, “Don’t do that’ I'd never get I

a chance to eat.”
In fact, the sincerity display-

ed by Chasan and the other stu- - 

dents who engaged Susskind in dis-
cussion brought a promise of fi-

nancial assistance for the suggest- ‘ 
ed scholarship assistance. Not . ‘ ’

long after this, a petition arrived

atthe University of Pittsburgh which you
said is ,a political move “in an attempt to
obtain publicity" is irrational, ridiculous
and absurd for a man in your position and
of your intelligence. I am inclined to be-
lieve‘ you want the publicity, not Senator
Fleming.

 Your statement will lead to unrest
and may ferment revolt among the stu-
dents when the legislation is being con-
sidered. If you and your administration
are unable to regulate the actions of the
‘students, the legislation must do it for the
good of the University.

 If--Dr. Charles H. Peake believes that
credits should not be given for the ROTC
program. I believe you should dismiss him
and all the other administrators and fac-
_ulty members who have the same opinion.
If the University does not promote the wel-
fare of-the United States of America, then
it should not exist. The University is sup-
ported by the tax payers, I am one, there-
-fore, the University should support the
welfare of the country. , . -* -

rights of free speech and assembly.

Beyond this, many of the other pro-
visions in sections 1 and 3 of the Flem-
ing bill may be deemed unconstitu-
tional after the test case. Legal sourc-
es have told The Pitt News. that there
is some le g at precedent running
against the grain of Fleming-type
legislation. In the final analysis, the
Fleming bill seens to be a huge waste
of time for all concerned parties.

The legal question, however. is
only detriment to the Fleming legis-
lation. Sen. Fleming honestly believes
that his bill will serve as a deterrent
to campus disorders. This percep-
tion seems to be based on a profound
lack of information. ‘

The reaction to the passage of the
Fleming bill will prostitute the ideals
which Sen. Fleming seeks. No one here
at the University of Pittsburgh really
wants to stage violent demonstration.
And if. a “violent demonstration” is
precipitated, students are quite con-
fident that our administration can
handle the problem.

But no force in this state will be
able to handle the student reaction
to the possible passage of the Fleming
bill. To students, it represents a re-
pressive force that limits dissent in
the free and open environment of a
university. \

Sen. Fleming says he is interest-
ed in the progression of sound educa-
tion. We believe this statement. And
if he is truly interested in averting
violent protests, he will withdraw
his bill. -

What Sen. -Fleming fails to realize
is that his bill will cause an unparal-
led holocaust on this and other Penn-
sylvania campuses. This would be un-
fortunate. Don’t you agree Senator?

.-. ' 

  

I am happy to learn that Mr. Clarence
G. Beers has the integrity and fortitude
to refuse to be intimidated by the demands
of the students and it is about time that
some of the “top administrators" take
a lesson from him. If you are timid. please
resign before you are discharged.

I am not sure what Wolfram Swoboda
means when he says “It's not their (cor-
poration executivesl university. it‘s our

_ university." If he means that the Univer-
sity belongs to the faculty. he is inaccur-
ate and mistaken. The University belongs
to the United States of America. the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania. the City of
Pittsburgh. and to the tax paying public.
If the present administration is so weak
that it cannot properly operate the Univer-
sity as a great institution. then it is time
to change.

I  From The End Of The Barge;

How It REALLY Is...

By GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

For. the second time in a week. a very
close friend has called this newspaper an
ideological test program to implement
very. very liberal ideas. It either has been
called a “slanted yellow sheet." or the
sole philosophy of the editor.

Well. it‘s about time someone told it

- like it REALLY is. A  .

  
   

Let’s go back several —'
years.

The actions of The
Pitt News generally
have been conserva- 
tive. extending from ‘
the last year rule un-
der the late Chancellor ., _
Edward Litchfield un-   ”
til Dr. Posvar became LIES
chancellor. The newspaper might have
been called a pal of the administration.

WHEN IT WON a small concession.
like. a bookstore discount. the newspaper
claimed a great victory. And when it took
an editorial stand in one issue. it would
let it drop in the next. feeling one editor-
ial had done justice to the problem.

One of the reasons for this conserva-
tive-slant was that for three years this
school remained stagnant. It had no lead-
ership. After incurring a $19 million dol-
lar expansion debt. Dr. Litchfield left.
Acting Chancellor Stanton Crawford died.
and until Dr. David Kurtzman was ap-.
pointed acting chancellor. the school had
no leader for over a year.

For three years. the establishment
creaked and croaked. Nothing could be
done by The Pitt News or any other univer-
sity function. In those days. the newspaper
was called a “wishy-washy sheet."

WHEN THE TRUSTEES and the top
administrators on campus went hunting.
for a chancellor. they found Dr. Wesley

the Negro in this country/.’

   

Today's Quote

Malcolm X, in his autobiography:
. ‘‘I would hate to be a general of an army as bad-
ly informed as the American white man has been about

 

Posvar. “The best man possible." they

said at the time.

They were correct. But in the last an-
alysis. Dr. Posvar will be the best possible
man for the times and not for the conserva-
tive attitude of the university hierarchy.
He is a man who confronts change. look-
ing for the best solution in perspective
to today's scene. (His only mistake thus
far has been‘ his choice of certain advis-
ers.>

That is why he’s in very hot water now.
His decisions may be in tune with today’s
social picture. but they go against the
grain of this university environment. The
higher-up men have failed to understand
their own choice.

Into this conservative environment,
The (“slanted”) Pitt News did come.

_ And there is no doubt about. this newspa-

per carried the biggest liberal f'lag in all
of its history. Even with the staunch con-
servative ideas of certain editors. every-
onerealized the only way to achieve even
small change was to ask for huge chang-
es.

THE NEWSPAPER has attempted to i "

look beyond the sometimes narrow mind-
ed ideas of not only administrators but of
students. too. Students many times get
bogged down with the today. neglecting the
tomorrow. They try to get by for the pres-
ent. and do not plan ahead.

This newspaper has voiced its approv-
al of what so far have been constructive
demonstrations. things vital to all stu-

dents on this campus. Through editorials ‘I

and columns. the newspaper has hit at the
“step-backward attitude"
Harrisburg and the Cathedral of Learning.

Literally. through various viewpoints.

The Pitt News has tried to make a scene.

And if the black student sit-in isan exam-
pletof getting things accomplished. then

maybe the newspaper has the right idea.

   

;;;;;;.;?Reflections Of The Spleen 

Just FilliOut The Blanks

By MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist ,

Out of curiosity. I went to the meeting
held Monday concerning the language re-
quirement at this University. The con-
frontation held on the ninth floor between
Dean Kehl and about 20 concerned stu-
dents was fairly interesting. but. as usual
inconclusive.

I think that these //
meetings can be done
away with; that is. the

business that goes on
at them could be con-
ducted by using a stand-
ardized form.

Each side of the con-
frontation would just
nu in the blanks on//

 
   
 

/ . 
l 
these forms. thus rid-Q all /[
osding themselves of the -\\ 1, //

necessity of -actually talking to each other.

HERE IS AN EXAMPLE of what I
mean — I'll call this form the “Concerned
Students Versus the Administration“
form. It would go something like this:

Student: Good afternoon. Dean ———.
my name is —e—— ———. and I represent
an ad hoc committee of students who are
opposed to the ———-— policy at this Uni-
versity. We feel that the present —-——
policy is unfair because 1) ——— 2)-———
and 3 )———. Therefore. we feel that ———-
should be abolished from this campus.
We would like you to make a statement
of your views on the —-—-— problem.

_Dean:i’Well. ,——e. let me ‘start off by

saying I'm glad that you came up to see
me. Let me introduce Assistant Dean
———— of the ——— department and Assis-
tant Dean ——— of the ——— department.
Now I realize that the ———- problem has
been an important one for many years.
The points you bring up about ———— are
well-prepared and very relevant-. This is
the first time in ————— years that the ———
issue has been brought so sharply to my
attention. and I can assure that I have done
extensive thinking on this ——-— problem.

Student: But Dean —————. we don’t want
any more revisions. All we want from you
is a statement that you either support or
reject the present University policy on

Dean: Well. I think through a process
of revision and reconsideration we can
come upon a’ more viable manner of re-
viewing the ———— policy. Now the ———-
———— committee is meeting tomorrow at
——— o’clock and I’m sure that the ———
issue will be discussed. A

Assistant Dean: Yes. I believe it will.

Assistant Assistant Dean: Certainly.
of course it will.

Student: Thank you for your views?.
Dean ———. but you really haven‘t ans-
wered our request. ’

Dean: Well. I have a ——— meeting to
go to at ————— o'clock. so I must be off.-
I thank all of you for coming up here and
voicing your opinions on the ——+ issue.
Remember. my office is open to you any-

time. I think more concrete discussion
like this is what the University needs,"

Michigan Has Language Requ

Editor's note:

George Gray, former captain of the‘Uni-
versity’s.College Bowl team, is presently a
graduate student in History at the University
of Michigan. He sent the following letter
and columns to Editor-Elect Dave Tiernan,
and we have reprinted them here to present
the views of others on the language require-
ment.

Former Student Writes
About Requirement

Guten Tag Herr Tiernan,

While I was home in Pittsburth this weekend. I happened to read
a column you wrote in the Pitt News on the question of language re-
quirements. I thought the column raised many of the issues which are
important in such a discussion. Although I have not in the past had too
much difficulty with foreign languages and have taken four of them at
one time or another. I fully sympathize with those who oppose the
language requirement. I agree that it should be abolished.

I remember that on the day of Pitt's commencement last spring.
you interviewed me on the steps of Schenley Hall and I expressed the
opinion that universities should grant two (at least two) sorts of de-
grees, i.e. an honors degree and a regular degree. I believe that the
language requirement and a stiff distrubution requirement should be
met by Anyone who wants to graduate with honors; for those who
wish to get the regular degree the language requirement is unneces-
sary and the existing distribution requirement is adequate.

The University of Michigan is also experienceing debate over
language and distribution reqirements. At the risk of swamping you
in clippings, I have enclosed a sample of what has appeared in The
Michigan Daily during the past week. (A note of clarification: refer-
ences in the articles to “the literary college” mean the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts which is the equivalent of Pitt’s
College of Arts and Sciences.)

Here at Michigan, the students soon found that the issue of re-
quirements soon became entangled with another, that of, student pow-
er. While the faculty has not yet voted. the tone of the discussion at
recent faculty meetings has indicated strong faculty sentiment to
retain the requirements. So students now claim the prerogative of hav-
ing a voice in the decision—making process, something more than just

» the opportunity to voice their feelings. The question of student power
has also come up with regard to the recent der.ial of tenure to two pop-
ular faculty members (the same sort of thing which brought about the
recentsit-in at the University of Chicago I.

As far as student power is concerned, I agree with the views which
held that students should have an advisory role, but no share ih deci-
sion—making. The enclosed articles of Prof. Cohen express this view.

A separate matter is that of the scholarship fund ($7.000) won by
our appearances on College Bowl. Last spring Mr. Critchfield and Miss
Bonney asked the team members to propose how the fund would be ad-
ministered. Our proposal was submitted last April. but I have never
heard what became of the idea. -I wonder if anyone does know what
finally was decided. Our proposal seems, in retrospect. a little too
cumbersome in its details, but the general idea we agreed upon does seem
sound. I would be interested to know what happened.

I hope you find the enclosures of some interest. I think the, issues
are more complex than they appear at first and it is well to study a
wide range of opinion. ‘

George T. Gray. Jr.

Michigan Daily

My French books burned sur-
prisingly slowly in our fireplace.
At first the three books just smold-
ered. But when I threw in a pizza
box. the flames leaped up the
chimney. ‘

After finals in December when
I set fire to my French books. I
experienced an outpouring of
anger. frustration and resent-
ment. I felt very little relief as
I sat watching Moliere’s pompous
wig on the cover of Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme darken into as.

Mostly there were just bad
memories.

Memories of the three terms I

T spend fulfilling the language re-

quirement.

Memories of 50 dull. stifling
minutes in the Frieze Bldg.

Memories of cutting French to
avoid those 50 minutes.

Memories of French quizzes
every Friday morning and of
pulling all-nighters every Thurs-
day night to make up for the time
I refused to spend in class.

THE ARGUMENTS against the
language requirement will not

bear restating. During the past-

year. as the outcry against the
requirements gained at least
some audibility. those arguments

have become hackneyed clarions

of a movement that somehow can-
not move many students to action.

For those who have suffered
through two. three or four terms
of elementary language studyjat’
the University. there can be no
distilling the causes of pain. In-
deed, some of the malignancy
comes from the‘ juxtaposition of
coercion and uninteresting. fruit-
less hourswasted in unwanted
language classes.

But the question of just how
that painful combination oper-
ates on the student is an ir-
relevant detail. Clearly. the
language requirement must go.

THE RECENT OUTCRY, how-
ever weak. has thrown light on
some of the significant effects
and side—effects of the required
language study.

And unlike the arguments a-
gainst the requirement. these ar-
guments bear repeating, for in
microcosm. they replicate the
lifestream of the University.

At recent meetings of the liter-

Teaching Fellows Voice Views
On Proposed Language Reforms

yesterday’s meeting spoke against
the language requirement in its
present form. although they did

by DAVID SPURR
Michigan Daily

Teaching fellows from four
language departments aried their
views yesterday on the language
requirement before the literary
college curriculum committee.

The committee also heard a
proposal from Prof. William Cres-
sey of the Spanish department
which provides for the gradual
adoption of a language entrance
requirement rather than the pres-
ent language graduation require-
ment.

Cressey’s proposal also suggest-
ed that all first-year language
courses be taught on a pass-fail
basis.

The committee will consider
Cressey’s proposal, with several
others that have been submitted.
at its next two meetings.

Committee Chairman Prof.
James Gindin has said the com-
mittee will have a recommenda-
tion on the language requirement
for the college faculty at its
March 3 meeting.

A ,Most of the teaching fellowsat

favor some type of requirement.

Jo Shuchat. a teaching fellow in
French, suggested the University
provide language instruction in
foreign countries. Students who
studied abroad for one semester
could then be granted the 16
credit-hours needed to satisfy the
language requirement. she pro-
posed. ‘

Gindin then pointed out the
“impracticality" of the idea. “It
would take several years for the
University to establish such a pro-
gram.” he said.

Mrs. Shuchat said she favors
some kind of requirement because
“American students are too pro-
vincial.

“We could substitute a two-
year requirement of study in lit-
erature. culture. art or music of
a particular foreign country,"
she offered.

David MacMurray. a teaching
fellow in the Spanish Department.
said he was “suspicious of people

who say language is necessary to

learn a culture."

MacMurray proposed that stu-
dents be given the option of cul-
tural studies. claiming that “many
students would be inspired to
learn the language after they had
studied a country.” -

Prof. Otto Graf of the German
department. a member of the cur-
riculum committee, lended sup-
port to the idea. “Courses in
Asian studies are often recruiters
for the Chinese and Japanese
language courses,” he said.

Karen Bloser. another French
teaching fellow also favored sub-
stitution of culture courses that
could meet the requirement.

“We are supposed to educate
students for the future.” she said.
“but very few students use their
language after graduation.”

Miss
doubt concerning the intellectual
value of learning a language.

“Learning a language is a ver-
bal skill," she said. “Its value to
the mind is different fromithat
of literature or history.” ' '

 

ary college faculty, the scene

, has been a frightening reminder

of the hypocrisy of a group of
professors claiming to provide lib-
eral education for their students.

Perhaps the seemingly blind
intransigence of these professors
is unrepresentative. Perhaps the
truly liberal faculty members are
in the majority and are merely
waiting on the sidelines until the
reactionaries tire of anachronistic.
elitist rhetroic. Perhaps.

But equally likely, the tone
of recent faculty debate will be
repeated when the question of
language requirements, comes
up again in March. And what is
worse. the 'mood of the recent
debate over language require-
ments may only be a prelude to
faculty reaction against upcom-
ing proposals to give students a
meaningful vote in college-wide
decision-making.

“Look! Someone’s taken all the good seats!” he said. Dr

‘I I say it, but it must have been said. After all, no one likes to sit

 ' in the back.

Nevertheless, all of the good seats were taken at the Leroi Jones

in the»SU ballroom early in order to get a good seat. ‘But black people

C ‘in those front rows.

The lecture was an experi-
 ence that all caucasians (includ-

iety) should undergo. First, we
.,;. crowded into the back rows and
-_ ’ told each other that we could see

1 the podium perfectly. Shortly
thereafter, a black man stepped
up to the podium to announce
 that Mr. Jones would be late.
 The voice was clear but, the
face was hazy and we couldn’t

_, Then it was announced that
'j‘we.would all be entertained by
j ‘dramatic readings of the poetry
" of Leroi Jones and others until
- the speaker's arrival. It was
 racial poetry. It was poetry that
,:.‘ could be summed up in two
5 words, “hate whitey.”

, “This poem is for us,” the

 zblack reader announced, “as op-
 -posed to them.” This was the in-

troduction for most of the poems.

 The poetry reading was on the
A 1 » order of a revival meeting. Blacks

shouted, cheered, raised fists, and
 5, gave standing ovations while the
 poetry called whites “ignorant,”

  
  

“exploiters,” “rapists,” and “lyn-

V Mr. Jones speech was of the
 "same order. Black separation.

, word “integration” was con-

We whites (probably for the

first time in our lives) had the

. feeling that we weren’t wanted

Even though we comprised a

‘ slight majority of the audience,

. we were treated as if we weren’t

We whites were hated for our
color. (Imagine that! In the Unit-

indiscriminately and collectively

No one called us names. No

the hatred. We sensed the un-

We hated it, and I hated it.
And I hated myself. I hated my-
~ self for being a part of a group

I hated myself for the times
that I have uttered “nigger.” I

in which my friends and I called
each other “niggers” when we
argued. It was the ultimate in-

spoken before the first fist was
raised.

Worst, worst, worst, worst of
all. I hated to listen to the truth.
I am ashamed that I have no de-
fense to offer to the hateful
charges leveled against whites at
that lecture.

The saddest thing of all is

that more whites did not attend..

Where was that lily-white group
of affluent Americans that likes
to call itself “liberal” and likes
to believe that it knows where

wrong but I didn’t see one admin-

istrator in attendance.

mending the . condemnation of

do you white “liberals” or ad-

man? What do youknow of his
history, his present condition in
America, his hatred of you?

I, too. hate white America.
For what it has done to non-
white America and continues to

_V Many popular muths concerning
 _alcoholism and the alcoholic
 were explored at the lecture en-
‘ titled “Current Issues in Alcohol-
ism.” The lecture, one of a ser-

it fecutive director of the Chit Chat

Wold contends that the term
A" I‘ “alcoholism” resists definition.
 One definition he came across
‘- 7 stated that “An alcoholic is a per-
1- son who drinks at the wrong time,
in the wrong place, for the wrong
reason.” Wold did not agree
 with this and offered his own def-
‘f , inition. He stated that alcoholism
 “ihhibits one’s potential for ex-
 periencing life.”

 . _ Wold feels that the popular be-
,“lief that only alcoholics can help
 other alcoholics is purely a muth.
He feels, however, that very few

tion. He contends that people in
the medical field tend to see al-
coholism as a medical problem
while social workers tend to see
it as a social problem. He termed
this tendency “parochialism.”
This parochialism causes diagon-
ostic labels to be used in reha-
bilitation attempts. Wold ar-
gues that these labels are the
greatest deterent to rehabilitation
because they emphasize the fol-
lowing of a model. He strongly
contends that one must ‘look be-
yond the symptoms since one
cannot manufacture recovery.

Wold stated that although no
one treatement stands out Alco-
holics Anynymous has proved to be
the “most available and most ef-
fective” of present treatments.
The primary prerequisite for re-
habilitation, he concluded. must
be the motivation to change the
situation.

 

A  GoaliIl’lrerequisites Determined

choice, his intelligence, and his desire to
buy or not. However, even the most
creative and persuasive advertising will
not sustain sales of inferior merchandise
for very long.

Thus the question: are today's ad
campaigns designed to shock a
media-controlled public into buying or to
prove the creative splendor of the
advertising business? l’contend business
is being trampled upon by the ad
agencies’ quest for creativity; and,
therefore, if the product does sell

it is strictly accidental.

“If I were starting life over again, I am inclined to
think that I would go into the advertising business
in preference to almost any other. This is because
advertising has come to cover the whole range of
human needs and also because it combines real
imagination with a deep study of human psychology.
_ Because it brings to the greatest number of people

actual knowledge concemi,ng useful things, it is
essentiallya form of education... It has risen with
ever-growing rapidity to the dignity of an art. It is
constantly paving new paths...The general raising. of
the standards of modern civilization among all groups
of people during the past half century would have‘
been impossible without the spreading of the knowl-
edge of higher standards by means of advertising!’

' Analysis by Roy Jacobs

Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
Dave Adams’ wrestlers hope
to even their record at 4-4
against Army at the Field
House. All indications are that
the meet will be very close.
We see it this way:

123

Army’s Scott Patten has
been inconsistent this year,
while the varsity’s Torn Grant
is fast improving, losing only
once in his last four outings.
Patten’s experience, though.
will give him the decision.
Army, 3-0.

130

Mike Mulladay of Army is
a tough customer, but this is
Larry Cuba’s year. A six—meet
win streak will propel Cuba
to a hard-earned victory over
Mullady (4-5). Match ,tied,
3_3' , ,

137

‘The Cadets’ Jim Byrnes is
having a good senior year (5-
3-1) after being sidelined last _
season, but Pat Lavery has
beaten some better wrestlers
already in compiling a 6-1
record. Lavery in a thriller.
Pitt, 6-3.

' 145

Varsity sophomore Mark
Payne has scored pins the last
two times out and has won
four straight. Army’s Bill Mc-
Beth is streaking, too, winning
his last five including an 11-1
victory over Lehigh’s highly
regarded Jay Leeman. Payne
should ‘manage a decision.
Pitt, 9-3.

‘ 152

Army’s Mark Hoffman has
had a poor season so far after
finishing fourth in the East-
erns last year. However, last
week he upset Lehigh’s Tom
Muir, “3-0. Buddy Morris is

last year in the E.I.W.A.’s.

at the hands of -the Lions

Penn State tomorrow night at
the Field House. Game time

is8:15 p.m.

Earlier this season, the cagers’
were dumped. 65-50, at State
College. But the score should be

a lot closer in the return match.

“We split with West Virginia,”
recalled freshman coach Tim,

Grgurich. “It would be nice

we could split with Penn State

also.”

The key to beating the Lions
will most probably be rebound-
ing. Against Army and Fordham,
the cagers were outmuscled and
- jumped underneath the
boards and the results were two
big losses. However, Penn State
doesn’t have the same animal-
power that the New Yorkers use.

“They’re not as_ strong physic-
ally,” said Coach Buzz Ridl, com-
paring Penn State with Fordham,
“They won’t give us as much

out

trouble.”

The Lions, however, will be
trouble — particularly big Bill
Stansfield, whose 14 points_help-
ed Penn State win the first meet

of the two rivalries.

In that game Stansfield’s big
6-8 frame proved hard to cope
with.‘ In fact, the only way the
cagers managed to stop the pivot
was by fouling him. However,
that didn’t really stop Stansfield
who converged on 10 of 14 char-

ity tosses.

The varsity will be gunning for
i_ts third ‘straight win tomorrow
and its fourth ‘in the last five
meets. A win tomorrow would
even the matmen’s dual meet re-
cord at 4-4.

Army, meanwhile, comes into
the Field House with a 4 - 3 - 2 -
mark. Although the record is not
impressive on paper, the Cadets
are undefeated against Eastern
opponents, _having defeated Yale
(36-0), Princeton ‘('24-6), Syra-
cuse (38-6) and Springfield (22-
11). The West Pointers also hold
ties with perennial Eastern pow-
ers Leheigh and Penn State.

“We have a chance to win to-
morrow,” explained Adams.

triumph over the hoopsters mark-
ed the tenth straight.

Ridl hopes to see an improve-
ment in rebounding against the
Lion five, a team that is more
in the cager weight ‘and strength
class.

of

“Sometimes a couple of re-
bounds make the difference,”
said Ridl earlier in the week.

Rebounding improvement will
depend on Jerry Causer and Mike
Patcher. Both performers have
had recent trouble staying in the
game for the final buzzer. Wed-
nesday night, against Fordham,
Patcher fouled out with just. un-
der 7 minutes left on the clock.
Causer was a little luckier. com-
mitting his fifth personal with
2:11 remaining in the contest.

Causer. the cager’s second lead-
ing rebounder. will probably get
the Stansfield assignment.’ That
will leave Mike Patcher lined-
up against Bill Young, a 6-6, 220
pound senior forward.

“I perfer playing forward,”
said Patcher. “I hope to finish
my college career as a forward.

’ With Causer taking the big man,
I have more of a chance under-
neath. There's less pressure.”

The cagers also expect to have
work cut out for them tomorrow

and keep from getting pinned.
It’s going to be hard.” he contin-
ued, “but we have six boys who
are capable of winning against
them if they wrestle up to their
potential.” ’ .

Army’s balanced line-up is
considered to be very strong in
the heavier weight classes, no-
tably from l52‘and up. The
Cadets also have experienced
lettermen in each of the first
four weight classes.

Leading performers to date

for Army have been 160 pound-
er Mike Nardotti and 167-pound-

er Greg Smith. Nardotti is cur-_

rently 7-1-1.’ He places third in
the Easterns and sixth in the na-
tionals last year, when he went
undefeated in dual meets.

Smith is undefeated at 9-0 this
season and has three pins to his
credit thus far.

Mark Hoffman, at 152, is also
a tough performer, according to
coach Adams, despite the fact that
his 3-4 won-lost record does not
measure up to those of Smith and
Nardotti. “Hoffman has beaten
two good boys, one from Penn
State and one from Leheigh,” ex-

, plained. the coach. “He’s been up

and down but he can be tough.”

Dave Adams’ streaking grapplers will be out to keep their
winning streak alive tomorrow afternoon when they tackle

In Crucial Bout

Hoffman will be going against
Buddy Morris at 152, and ac-
cording to assistant coach Bob
Fehrs, the 152 bout could be the
most important in the match.

With Morris going at 152,
Bobby Kuhn will move down
from 167 to 160 for tomorrow’s
match. Kuhn has won three
straight at 167. Undefeated Ralph
Cindrich will be going for his

sixth win, while Mark Payne, Pat -

Lavery, and Larry Cuba are also
out to keep alive long winning
strings.

The only changes in the line-
up for the varsity tomorrow will
be at 167 and 177, where Adams
says he won’t be sure who’l1
wrestle till they walk on the
mat. Either Greg McClure, Ron
Levandowski or Marty Poehl
will wrestle at these two weights.
Jack Kuhn, a 177-pounder, has
been declared out for the sea-
son with an injury.

Cubs Seek Revenge Against
Rugged Johnstown Campus;

‘‘1 0 0 0 0
bt1llM1ss1ng Injured Scott
7 by BILL NAAB 7
Tomorrow night at 6:15 the Panther.Basketball Cubs bat-
tle forrevenge and respectability. The Cubs meet the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh at Johnstown and will attempt to avenge an
earlier loss at the Johnstown Campus. ~

The Cubs have only won one more game than they have lost (6-5) -
and need this game to remain above .

Coach Tim Grgurich isn’t tak-
ing the two-year campus light-
ly. Last_ week Johnstown
downed Wesley Junior College
of Delaware. Wesley is ranked
second to only Robert Morris in
Eastern Junior College basketball.

In the first game against John-
stown, the Cubs neither shot nor
rebounded well. Kent Scott play-
ed a good all around game and
scored 26 points. Reserves Jim
Tweardy and Ed Paluzzi also
added some punch to the unus-
ually weak Cub attack. However,
four of the Cub starters produc-
ed only four field goals through-
out the dreary evening.

If ‘the Cubs look for Scott to
carry the load again tomorrow.
they will have to look elsewhere.
More than a -week ago, he sprain-
ed his wrist and it has not been
responding to treatment. Grgurich

  
   
    
  

reports that he’ll probably be out 

for the season‘.

Glen Wolfel. small but sharp
defensively, will probably once
again take over for Scott. In ad-
dition, Paul‘ O’Gorek and Rod
Schoon will be expected to com-
mand the boards, since Johns-
town’s tallest man is only 6’4”.

. Grgurich mentioned that
Johnstown has. one or two play-
ers who might be able to help
Coach Buzz Ridl’s varsity next
year. However, there is a strong

become a four year school next
fall. This would mean that an
athlete would lose a year of
elgibility in transferring to the
Oakland Campus.

In looking back over theipast
couple of games, Grgurich said,
“I can’t really say if I’m disap-
pointed ornot, but I know they
can play and that’s the main
thing.” ’

He also remarked that losing
to Duquesne twice surprised him.
“But, we lost to them twice
when I was a freshman, and then
came back to knock them off two
straight years when we were var-
sity players in the Steel Bowl
finals. Our freshmen are just as
good as their’s at least I think so.
We’ve got good potential, and
some of the boys are going to find
themselves next year.”

Thinclads Try K. of C.

‘by ED CONLEY

Two of the world’s best milers go against each other to-
night in the feature race in New York City’s U. S. Olympic
Invitational meet; one of them is Jerry Richey.

Richey has been tabbed “by World Distance Performances”
as one of the ten top milers in the world, according to his coach, Jim
Banner. The other champion is Brian Kivlan, an Olympic trials vet-
eran, who has turned in a 3257.4 run indoors. The North Hills sopho-

more’s best indoor clocking is 4:07.

As if Kivlan wasn’t- tough
enough for Richey, another top
speedster, Marty Liquori of Vil-
linova, will be in the chase, also.

Banner won't have anyone else
in the New York meet, but the
other thinclads will be busy this
week end as they cross the state
line to compete in the Cleveland
Knights of Columbus Invitation-
al, tomorrow night.

“I don’t know much about the
field,” Banner mentioned. “but
it’s a big meet, it’ll be pretty
tough.”

Richey will lead the squad in
the meet. running in the two-
mile. The race will be a‘ change
of pace for the trackster. but the
Cleveland meet, itself, will not
be too strange. He entered the
mile as a freshman last year and
finished second.

The only other event that Ban-
ner had competitors in last winter
in the Invitational was the mile
relay. That team also grabbed a
second place finish,. This year
improvement is very likely since
the present quartet holds the var-
sity mark and has been winning
consistently. ‘

The other relay team, also a
varsity record holder, will be
there, too. Banner was thinking
of placing Smitty Brown and
Richey in the two-mile quartet.
an effort aimed at improving the
record. that was set a few weeks
ago. '

‘ “I don’t think we’ll be able to
do it, though.” he coach said.
“They have the events set up al-
ready. We’ll probably have to
WAITTILL Delaware( the Delaware

Invitational which has been post- I

poned until next month).

“But,” he added, “we can still
get a good squad in there.”

That statement is backed up by
the 7:45.7 effort that the quartet

of John Werner. Mark Vornha‘gen. 1

Greg Rodgers. and John Aiken
turned in a couple of weeks ago,
One other record—breaking thin-
clad will take the trip to Cleve-
land — Bryant Salter. He will
enter the high jump in the meet.

Gymnasts Vtstt   

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

The scene is set for a clash between the west-
ern Pennsylvania rivals. But any resemblance of a
clash between this meeting of the gymnasts and
Penn State’s powerhouse at University Park tomor-
row night will be purely accidental.

Unlike the track team, the gymnasts have had a
very rough season with only one win in eight
meets and don’t have the strength to defeat State.
In fact Penn State’s team is now in first place in the
Eastern Conference as they defeated Temple by 1.4
points last week.’ Being now undefeated in six con-

He has been competing in the
leap in the majoreastern invi-
tationals this season. but hasn’t
been able to win any top spots.
Last week against Penn State he
showed some indication of being
ready to end that drought
though, when he hit the 6’8” mark
again.’ The high jumper is still
seeking his first success above
that height.

meet of the year, but the visitor

It looked like the tankmen ‘were going to have a good evening as
they won the medley relay to take a quick 7-0 lead. Howard and Rich-
ard overcame a two body length deficit in their laps to win the race-.

Richard continued to sparkle in the 200-yard individual medley as
he copped first. In the 200-yd. butterfly, Howard swam his best time

of the year to capture first position.

They also took two second places, Howard in the 200—yd.. free-
style, and Richard in the 100-yd. Freestyle.

Dave Wessel again won both the one and three meter diving events.
He beat his nearest competitor in both events by over sixty points.

In the most exciting race of the evening, Gene Hoffman was touch-
ed out for first place by one-tenth of a second in the 200—yd. breastroke.
Despite the loss, Grant was pleased with many of the mermen’s
times. “Dave Smith swam his best times in both the 500 and 1000»yd.

freestyle,” he commented.

As in past meets, the tankme

Chuck Zientak placed second
' mark of the year.‘ -

Coach Bill Grant probably wishes. that the Norris twins
were triplets. Howard and Richard turned in outstanding per-
formances against Grove City in the final home swimming

ference meets. State seems to have the Eastern
Championships all but wrapped up.

Following this trend of eternal optimism. coach
Warren Neiger feels although a loss ‘is inevitable
that this meet has much to offer the gymnasts in
way of experience for next year.

“The boys havenever performed before a crowd
larger than one thousand and Saturday's meet will
provide them with the chance of performing before
a crowd of as much as four thousand.”

Continuing Neiger stated. “I’m really curious‘ to

prepare his team.

Except for meets against Syracuse and Temple.
State has completely dominated all their outings.
With scores consistently 160 or higher. They haveg,

_ eight men on‘ the team that can perform in all’
events including senior Bob Emery, who has been 
consistentently scoring above 9.1 in his events. ‘

“Their score may be a bit lower against us as T"
they may use some of theiryounger gymnasts,’-’f‘
explained Neiger. As for the gymnasts’ score they’ll .-
still lack one score in the floor exercise, but should, 1
still give very respectable performances in mostfr
of -the -events. A score between 95

expected. ’

The gymnasts will be at Syracuse‘ in two weeks
and are hoping to end the season then on a winning",
note. Syracuse has been scoring below one hundred

gymnasts.

he is for a much stronger team next vear. Neiger
