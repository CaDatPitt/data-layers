Thrill seeking makes for a costly week

By Kelly B. Casey

Photography Editor

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. —
Spring Break usually conjures up
images of drunken daredevils
diving from hotel balconies into
beer-laden swimming pools.

But Pitt spring breaker and for-
mer Pitt mascot Richard “R.J.”
Bock found an alternative sober
way to get a thrill out of Spring
Break — and not get evicted
from the hotel.

“What a rush,” R.J. explained to
the crowd what it was missing as
it watched the bungee jumpers.
“It was just like sex. A mental and
physical adrenaline rush,” said
the brave fourth—year student.

Penn State junior Scott Shell
had a different experience.

“Everything went black. I felt
like I was going to die,” the
health education major said, after
the $25 death defying plunge.

R.J., who said he does not real-
ly like to drink, had no problem
finding other ways to pass the
week.

Monday afternoon he sped

through the gulf on a wave-run-
ner, trying not to run over the
dolphins he met about two miles
out. Tuesday afternoon he spent
four hours throwing a ball at a
pyramid, a new beach game
called Trangleball.

Wednesday afternoon he
sailed two miles down the gulf
harnessed to a 28-foot nylon
parachute, pulled along by the
wind and a 600-foot rope tied to
a motor boat.

Thursday afternoon, R.J., sav-
ing the best for last, tried the
bungee jump.

Being a daredevil is not cheap.
By the end of the week, R.J. had
spent around $100 just for the
thrill of it.

0 $25 for 30 minutes on the
wave-runner.

0 $50 for parasailing.

0 $25 for a five-second bungee
leap.

° $15 to relive the jump vicari-
ously through a video tape and
to use it as evidence to prove it to
his unbelieving friends back
home.

0 $15 to buy a T-shirt pro-

claiming his feat.

Fortunately, he did get a free T-
shirt and a free lunch (nine
pieces of pizza) in the pizza eat-
ing contest. Unfortunately, he
was out-eaten by a 200-pound
spring breaker.

As R.J. combed the beach look-
ing for adventure, a dozen Ball
State spring breakers never ven-
tured more than a few feet from
their keg buried in the sand.

Monday through Thursday, the
Indiana spring breakers chugged
beer for breakfast and lunch, tak-
ing a rest only to eat and nap
before drinking the night away.

The secret to non-stop party-
ing?

“You’ve got to
endurance,” pre—law senior Bruce
Crelon said.

Ball State junior Chuck
Calobrace got a notice from the
police to appear in court this
Wednesday. He was cited for
public drunkenness after he
passed out in a car he mistook
for his own. The next day he was
given a $39 fine for “noise pollu-

Research paper substitutes for beach

By Beth Kovaly
Asst News Editor

Spending Spring Break at
the beach sounds ideal --
spending it in the library or
computer lab does not.

While many Pitt students
lived it up in sunny Florida
last week (before the torna-
does and snow, that is), a
week of break meant a week
of work for others.

Hillman Library remained
open, and ambitious stu-
dents could be found
researching term papers,

typing on the computers or
just plain studying.

Pitt junior James said he
had a lot of assignments due
this week and wanted to get
a head start.

“I figure I’ll go and put my
time in now,” he explained.
“When [students] come back
and I’m pretty much caught
up and doing all right, they’ll
pretty much be busting their
asses.”

Sophomores Rachel and
Cindy, surrounded by note-
books, calculators and
papers, studied for a math

exam.

“Having a test right after
break is really dumb,”
Rachel said. “I mean, what
are teachers thinking?”

Cindy added that she start-
ed the week full of expecta-
tions of what she would get
done by Friday — but it
wasn’t working out quite
like she planned.

“I took a night off, and
then a friend came in from
Penn State, and, well, I
guess I got about half of
what I wanted to do done,”

An Equal Opportunity Employer M/F/D/V

By Chris Palmiero
For T be Pitt News

About this time every year thou~
sands of students migrate to
Florida’s sunny beaches to escape
college stresses. But this tradition
of going to the beach to catch
some rays is not for everyone.

I had the opportunity to go to
Stone Mountain, N.C., with the Pitt
Outdoors Club for part of Spring
Break. This mountain is far away
from the coast or any other signs
of what we call civilization.

Instead of spending lazy after-
noons on the beach, we hiked,
biked and climbed through the
mountains. If you think that
sounds more strenuous than going
to the beach, you’re right! But club
members wouldn’t have it any
other way.

I found that those who went had
common reasons for taking this
nontraditional vacation. One major
reason was the cost of the trip
itself. The three-day camping trip

she said.

Procrastination is also a
big problem for biology
major Eric.

“Last year I went to
California for break,” he
said. “It was great. But this
year, I keep thinking about
all the fun I had last year. So
I don’t get anything done.”

The library had none of its
usual humming activity. The
William Pitt Union was also
mostly deserted. No crowd-
ed lunch lines at Schenley
Cafe, no groups of sign lan-
guage students practicing in
the Red Room.

Most students said they
enjoyed the quiet emptiness
that break brought to cam-
pus.

When asked why, one stu-
dent replied, “Nobody gets
in my way.”

Some of the top reasons
why most students stayed at
Pitt included:

-I don’t have the money to
go anywhere.

-I’m saving for next year.

-I went someplace last
year.

-I couldn’t get off work.

-I have too much work to
do.

-I love Pitt and I can’t
stand to leave it, even for, a
week. (Just kidding.)

There was a very tan
female student working in
the computer lab at David
Lawrence. It looked like she
had already been to Florida
and back, yet it was only

Wednesday.

Her secret? Tanning salons.

“I can’t afford to go to the
beach,” she explained.

“But I don’t want to look
like a ghost when everybody
comes back golden. So, I’m

.spending the week on tan-

ning beds.”

After the rough weekend
weather, at least the students
hanging around Pitt missed
the travel hassles of getting
back.

“It was almost worth stay-
ing here over break,” first-
year student Stephanie said.
“At least I didn’t get stuck at
the airport for the weekend.”

Besides, everyone knows
Oakland looks a lot better
when it’s covered with
snow.

Pitt student Mike Ivan said that besides being cooler
than the beach, Stone Mountain is also cheaper than
Florida. “There all you do is spend, spend, spend,” Ivan
said.

Not everybody has $200 to $300 to go to Florida. Club
President Russ Wilson said he was surprised more students
didn’t take advantage of the trip because of its low cost.

Some club members agreed that a trip to Florida
wouldn’t be much of a break at all.

Pitt student Andrew Bamford said he doesn’t like the
stereotypical college crowds that are drawn to the tradi-
tional places.

He said that he wanted to get away from it all, relax and
bike through the mountains.

Sophomore Wright Bagwell said that a break in Florida
with a lot of other college students would not be much dif-
ferent than school or the city. For him, break in Florida
means the same big crowds and traffic.

“This was a sanity break for me, the hardest choice was
if I should go mountain biking or hike,” student Rick
Peterson said.

get in trouble. “Tomorrow I’m
gonna get thrown in jail or some-
thing.”

The Ball Staters were deter-
mined to make sure they'd be
remembered in Panama City
Beach.

By Thursday, the Ball State stu-
dents had already lost their six
rooms at the Sand Piper Beacon
Inn along with a $600 security
deposit for busting a refrigerator,
several deck chairs and throwing
a microwave off the balcony.

“We don’t get drunk, we_ got
stupid,” said senior Gordon
Hensely, majoring in secondary
education.

The only extracurricular activi-
ty, besides beer—chugging, that
the Ball State paitiers participated
in was the final game of a volley-
ball tournament.

Hardly able to stand up from
drinking all day, they lost miser-
ably, 15-4, 15-5.

Sixty—nine-year-old John
Guerin, who vacations a few
hotels down from the spring
breakers, was shocked by how
tame the students seemed.

“It’s amazing how they behave
themselves,” he said, over the
hundreds of scantily—clothed col-
lege students chugging beer,
tossing frisbees and flirting.

“They gave us a great impres-
sion,” the Canadian vacationer
said. ‘‘They’re all nice clean, with
all nice haircuts.”

Everybody, from bus drivers to
local police were pleased with
the relatively mellow spring
breakers.

“Last year it took 14 garbage
bags to clean up the bus,”
Trailway Lines bus driver John
Branoff said, noting how clean
the Pitt students left the bus after
21 hours. He added that last year

the toilet had to be disassembled
after students mistook it for a
beer can disposal.

“Pitt students are the best,” said
the Holiday Inn general manager
George Dracos. “They gave me
the least problems.”

Dracos noted one incident this
year with a Pitt student who inde-
cently exposed himself from a
balcony.

Housing nearly 800 spring
breakers, Dracos said his hotel
was well-prepared for the party-
proned guests.

“We have an 80—person securi-
ty staff on duty at all times,” plus
48 housekeepers to clean up the
aftermath of the week-long party-
ing, Dracos said.

Tom Misuraca, who founded
Pitt Spring Break trips five years
ago, said Pitt students know how
to have a good time without
causing trouble.

“Pitt students are absolutely the
class of the country,” said
Misuraca, who has been coordi-
nating Spring Break trips for over
15 years.

“I get nothing but compliments
from the hotel management,” he
added.

Misuraca also had nothing but
compliments for the hotel buses
and mother nature, who brought
five straight days of sun and
warm weather.

“Needless to say, Pitt students

are getting a hell of a vacation,”
he said.
“You won’t find a better hotel.
You won’t find anybody getting
buses better than Pitt students.
We [Pitt Program Council] do it
right.”

At rates of $150 a night for a
room in one of the top 20
Holiday Inns worldwide, most
college students could never
afford this vacation.

But the travel agency Inter-
campus Programs, which deals
solely with providing affordable
Spring Break trips to college stu-

dents, got 150 Pitt students a
round-trip bus ride and seven
nights at the ocean-front Holiday
Inn for $259.

Steve Cox, director of sales for
ICP, which packages Spring
Break trips for 16,000 to 20,000
college students nationwide, said
Pitt is one of his favorite schools.

“It’s so great to stait_the week
with the University of Pittsburgh
students,” Cox said. “They have
fun, but they don’t destroy.”

Cox said he has sent college
students to Cancun, Daytona,
Fort Lauderdale, South Pacific
Islands, Texas as well as Panama
City Beach, which he said is
probably the best new place for
spring breakers.

“The city really welcomes col-
lege students with open arms,”
he said, noting the cooperation
of the hotel security forces.

“The security guards walk
around in golf suits, not uni-
fomis,” he said.

As Fort Lauderdale and
Daytona deter college students
with higher hotel rates and jail
cells, Panama City seems to be
the most hospitable spot for
spring breakers.

University of Horiela first-year
student Juan Ivez said he prefers
the lax police force of Panama
City compared to other Florida
cities.

“In Daytona,” he said, “if you
get caught with a beer on the
beach, it doesn’t matter. They
throw you in jail. Here, they
just tell you to pour it out,” said
19-year-old Ivez, who has been
an avid spring breaker since
his sophomore year of high
school.

Misuraca agreed that Panama
City is the “up and coming”
Spring Break destination,‘ mainly
because it treats students with
respect.

“They [security] ask you,
they don’t tell you,” he
said.

ing through the eastern half of the country and was
expected to bury the whole eastern seaboard in snow.

What began as a two-day trip for The Pitt'News
turned into a seemingly nine-and-a-half week ordeal.

The trip was not without its highlights. The Big East
quarterfinals proved to provide a precedent for ugly
basketball. Miami scored a record-low 40 points in los-
ing to Georgetown in the first game.

While Pitt fans thought that nothing could top, or
bottom, this “game,” the Panthers then stepped on the
court against Syracuse and didn’t register double fig-
ures until the last nine minutes of the first half.

While weather still prompted sunglasses and
Madison Square Garden scalpers refused to comply
with our request for $10 tickets, Greenwich Village
awaited. Unfortunately, so did Bella Pizza.

At the poor advice of the resident hoops guru, a
plastic-esque substance was consumed to the tunes of
Toad The Wet Sprocket, The Doors and Urban Dance
Squad.

The tournament selection show soothed any aggres-
sions that built up over the extended week. As James
Brown guided the way through the murky waters of
the tournament, all feelings were assuaged and future
columns were born.

The ordeal ended when both the band and The Pitt
News staff arrived safely in Pittsburgh Monday after-
noon. Classes resumed Tuesday after an extra day hia-
tus and the college returned to normal.

Those who chose Florida got beaches, babes, bikinis
and tornados. Those who chose New York got basket-
ball, Broadway and a blizzard.

A fair trade—off?

The Waco Wacko

Terrorism is running rampant throughout the United States. In New

York a bomb was set off killing seven people and injuring hundreds .

more. In Florida, a pro-life activist shot and killed a doctor who per-
formed abortions. And in Texas, a cult leader has taken 107 people
captive, promising to fight to their very end.

For over three weeks, federal officers and the leader of the Branch
Davidians, David Koresh, have been involved in a standoff. Well armed
with highly advanced weapons, Koresh seems to be an unanswerable
question for the FBI.

Even his identity is a problem. First, Koresh, who has a long criminal
record, claimed to be Jesus Christ. Then, according to FBI spokesman
David Ricks, he changed his story. Now it seems that he claims to be a
messiah who is here to fulfill his prophesies. While it may be difficult to
figure out this man’s story, one thing is for certain — he is a very dan-
gerous individual.

Ninety adults and 17 children are held captive at the 77-acre Mt.
Caramel compound. Koresh claims several women as his wives, and it
has been reported that he frequently engages in sexual acts with the
children. To halt these atrocities, the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Fireami Agents battled with Koresh for over an hour on
Feb. 28. Four agents were killed and 16 more were injured. There is
also speculation that 10 cult members may have died. Koresh continues
to taunt federal ofiicials. “Let's get it on” and “we’re ready for war,” he
said to negotiators. .

Koresh’s act of defiance and his failure to cooperate with federal offi-
cials, has put the lives of many innocent individuals in jeopardy. Some
have expressed the desire to leave. Koresh says they are free to go but
choose not to. Others have claimed that they are willing to fight for
Koresh to the very end.

Mocked by the leader of the Branch Davidians, federal officers must
be careful not to repeat the perfomrance of Feb. 28. Going in well
armed and in large numbers could prove disastrous for an already-tar-
nished FBI. Koresh is not a normal individual. He would unquestion-
ably take the lives of his followers as he himself dies a “maityi’s” death.
Negotiation may not be an end in itself, but officials should stay the
course, resist the rash temptation and not enter the compound.

Happy Anniversary

Happy 25th anniversary to Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers. The popu-
lar television host has been a valuable friend and neighbor for children
and parents for a quarter of a century, and we hope that the next 25
years will be just as enlightening.

As children today look to characters like Bart Simpson for guidance,
the experience of growing up with Mr. Rogers takes on a special kind
of meaning — particularly to undergraduate and graduate students
today. Most of us have grown up with the warmth and caring of Mr.
Rogers.

While today we may look at a more comnlex world through different

‘ eyes, in Mr. Rogers’ world our droughts were filled with the innocence

>- -43¢. 1"

of characters such as the mailman Mr. McPheely, Lady Elaine the muse-
um curator, and King Friday the King of Make Believe.

Most importantly, our Pittsburgh neighbor continued to teach chil-
dren long after they were home from school. As he chariged his shoes
and cardigan sweater he took us o y excursions. He showed us
the ﬂowers and plants in the Phipps Conservatory, stressing that “like a
plant, we grow too.” -

It has gotten more and more difficult for children today to find posi-
tive role models. Popular athletes refuse to sign autographs and are sus-
pended for drug use. Musicians use explicit lyrics and photos to sell
records. Hollywood expounds on the virtues of violence. Thank god
we still have Fred Rogers, every bit the same man he was 25 years ago.
Congratulations on a job well done Mr. Rogers. You’ve been a positive
inﬂuence in all of our lives.

in

The idea behind an economic
plan is to increase the standard of
living. That’s simple enough. For
business that means — among
other things — increased profits,
greater investment and larger
shares of the market. For the aver-
age person, it means less concern
with a basic subsistence and more
focus on leisure activities and the
consumption of higher quality
products.

The American Dream is the dic-
tum with which we have come to
associate an increase in our stan-
dard of living. It is this notion —
that-the subsequent generations
should do better than previous
ones —— which led dissatisﬁed vot-
ers to choose demigod Bill Clinton
to lead a country run by mere mor-
tals in Congress.

Before Clinton took the oath of
office two months ago he cam-
paigned on the fact that during the
past four years just the opposite
occurred.

Yet, miraculously enough, the
economy “rebounded” immediate-
ly following Clinton’s election. Most
of the nation’s major newspapers
declared the recession over.
Business investments expanded at
an annual rate of eight percent in
the second half of last year.
Inflation remained fairly constantat
the lower end of three percent, and
ﬁnancial markets were particularly
happy. All are key indicators of a
successful recovery, which led me
to wonder, did President Clinton lie
to us about the problems underly-
ing the economy the same way he
did about his policy on Haitian
refugees or his middle-class tax cut’

As a result of the sudden upturn,
a debate was spurred as to whether
or not Clinton’s economic propos-
als favoring short-term fiscally dri-

ven growth were now necessary.
Clinton held steadfast to his pro-
posals (as evidenced by his speech
on the economy), and he is now
meeting with troubles not only
from Republicans but members of
his own party as well. It is hardly a
revelation to say that increasing
taxes is not a popular political
move. Now that it isn’t “necessary,”
many ask whats the sense?

I say because it is necessary. A
cyclical upturn in the business cycle

does not a health economy make.
Despite the good news about the
economy, the problems highlight-
ed by Clinton during the election
are representative of the deeper
issues facing this country. A dollar
today buys you as much as it did in
the early 1970s. Unemployment
increased 2 1/2 percent since its
low of 5 percent during the mid-
 The budget deficit skyrocket-
ed from 1.7 percent of Gross
National Product in 1979 to more
than 6 percent in 1993. Interest pay-
ments climbed to 15.8 percent of
GNP. Economic growth moved
along at a snails pace with the aver-
age annual increase in GNP declin-
ing from 3.3 percent in the 1970s to
2.85 percent in the 1980s.

Worker productivity and techno-
logical innovation grew much\
more slowly than our major com-
petitors abroad. Today, it seems
that by the time an American com-
pany has leamed a lesson from a
Japanese “How—to" book the
Japanese have moved on to a sec-
ond and third edition.

Popular conservative columnists
such as William Safire, George Will

and The Pitt News’ Ed Kichline have
called Clinton’s plan more tax and
spend. It seems to be the major
consensus among Republicans on
Capitol Hill as well. But while
opponents scream and holler about
the “Old Democrat” Clinton, they’re
canying on misses the point

Clinton’s plan is remarkably sen-
sible. First of all, it calls for an
investment tax credit of 7 percent
for both small and large business.
Small businesses receive a credit on
what they spend this year and next
on new equipment. Larger busi-
nesses receive the credit for long-
term investment schedules and
increases in spending on equip-
ment.

Secondly, “the wasteful spend-
ing” element of his plan is based on
long—term investment in the
nation’s infrastructure —— something
that any economist would tell you
is essential for continued prosperi-
ty. His fiscal injection goes to high-
ways, airport safety systems, the
weather service, mass transit, rural
water systems and education.

Even Adam Smith, the father of
modern economics and a propo-
nent of small government, knew of
the failure of markets. He, too, rec-
ognized the inability of markets to
allocate public goods efficiently
and advocated a role for govem-
ment in the building of roads and
education of children.

As Jack Kemp, fomier congress-
man and Bush cabinet member,
asserts, lower taxes are always bet-
ter for the economy than high ones.
But so are lower deﬁcits better than
high deficits. If Clinton can both
straighten out some of the funda-
mental structural problems facing
this economy and lower the deficit
he will undoubtedly be remem-
bered as one of our nation’s great-
est presidents. Amidst all the prog-
nosticating, only time will tell us
how good or bad his plan was. But

NCAA selection p

In the aftermath of selection Sunday, a
mob of analysts, columnists and talk show
gurus have been quick to jump on Pitt for
receiving an NCAA Tournament bid. And,
after all, with the exception of some local
colunmists who have been rambling on
ignorantly, those in the know agree that the
Panthers are undeserving of a tourney bid
under the current selection system.

That’s not to say Pitt wouldn’t be worthy
under a different system, say one that select-
ed the top 64 teams, period. If that were the
case, Pitt would certainly merit a selection.
That does not mean Pitt, at this moment, is a
quality team, and that is why so many peo-
ple have a problem with the Panthers’ place
among the field under the current circum-

ference tournaments is the first problem with

tumbles to team records

By Todd 8. Rimer
Staff Writer

The goal was set two months
ago.

“We will break the school team
record of 186.90 by the end of
the season,” first—year Pitt gym-
nast Bethany Toellner said after
the Panthers’ first meet of the sea-
son back on Jan. 15.

That was quite a bold state-
ment at the time, considering the
concern over the existing and
possible future injuries and the
uncertainty surrounding the per-
formance of the frrst—year students
over the course of the season.

Seven weeks later that prophe-
cy became reality as the gymnas-
tics team ilipped and tumbled its
way en route to having the best
three meets in team history.

On the first Saturday during
Spring Break the team hosted
Ohio State and Towson State,

automatic bids to teams who excel for one
weekend would produce a better field. Now,
teams that perform well all season and get
upset in conference tourneys are punished
for having one bad game. Conference tour-
naments serve one purpose: making money
for the leagues. That’s all. Is there anybody
in America who thinks ACC tourname.nt win-
ner Georgia Tech is better than regular sea-

son champ North Carolina?

That brings us to the next issue, that of the
“small" conferences — those like the Big
South, the Mideastern Athletic‘. the Metro
Atlantic, the Southland and the Ohio Valley.
Should these conferences receive. the oppor-
tunity to compete for the Championship like
everyone else in Division I, or should they
bag the system of dishing out automatic bids
like candy and simply stack the tourney field

with the best 64 teams?

That would mean the difference between
seeing \Y'right State, Rider, East Carolina,
Coastal Carolina and Tennessee State and
seeing INLV, Oklahoma. Minnesota, St.
_jo<e.plr‘s and Providence. That sounds like

an easy decision, but as much as many of

with each team earning a score of
191.1 and 188.8, respectively.

This meet was the crux of the
season for Pitt. The possibility of
qualifying for the ECAC
Championships and an eventual
berth in the Regional
Championships (playoffs) rested
on the outcome. They had a cou-
ple of questionable performances
going into the meet and they
needed to resolve the problems
of inconsistency and below aver-
age contributions on the part of
some of the gymnasts.

The record-breaking score of
187.50 was due in large part to a
rebirth of a confident, unified
team. The team had good scores
throughout the better part of the
season, but for various unknown

forming up to its potential. The

is also available.

In this, the new age of
freedom and free agency
(ironic words knowing the
money it will cost NFL own-
ers), White is the top prize,
being courted by much of
the NFL.

The main link between
White and Gibbs is that
their similarities were
expected to make White
choose the Redskins, but
with Gibbs gone, the Reggie
Derby seems wide open.

Too bad the Steelers are
no part of it. The lack of

the fatal flaw of a solid

the team a championship

Steelers could actually break
their conference’s dismal
showing in the big game.

Due to the Rooney rule
(thanks Dan), the Steelers
can spend overa million

another team and the
Steelers have to decide
whether to match it or not.
What do they do? Forget it.
If he gets that, Barry Foster
has to get about eight mil-
lion. At least he has one full
all—pro season as opposed to
just a few games with nice
number like Mr. O’Donnell.

Besides, the Steelers don’t
lose much with Brister and
there are plenty of quality
backup’ quarterbacks avail-
able (David Archer, Mike
Tomczack, etc.).

The Steelers need to direct
their money toward filling in
the holes. They moved back
into contention last season,
but free agency could be
the key to reaching the next
level.

NCAA

Continued from page 9
these deserving “big time”
teams have been severely
deprived, it would not be fair
to eliminate the small confer-
ences.

They are Division I schools
and deserve a fair shot at play-
ing the Indianas, North
Carolinas and Dukes of the
basketball world. Every so
often the tourney produces a
scintillating upset, like Austin
Peay over Illinois in 1987 and
Richmond over Syracuse in
‘91. That is an element that
cannot be taken away.
Furthermore, if the committee
did its job properly, there
would only be one or two
worthy clubs missing the tour-
nament rather than seven or
eight.

Look at Pitt. The Panthers
survived the cut largely due to
two wins. If two “quality” wins
get it done then 15-12 Ohio
State should still be in before
Pitt.

How Paul Evans can sit there
and say he had confidence all
along in Pitt’s chances is
beyond me, but then again the
system is to blame. Beating
UCLA at home and Illinois on
the road is not enough in itself
to merit an invitation. NIT-
bound Ohio State beat Purdue
and top—ranked Indiana, and
has improved dramatically
from December. This is a
faulty process, plain and sim-
ple.

Entirely too much of the
selection process revolves
around numbers and statistics,
completely disregarding any
subjectivity. Why not just put a
committee of robots in a room
and feed them numbers and
let them spit out the brackets
at this point? The human ele-
ment is missing.

While the Ratings Percentage
Index provides valuable infor-
mation and weighs vital cate-
gories like strength of sched-
ule, it still does not tell the
whole picture. Wins and losses
are all that matter in the final
analysis, but it is unrealistic to
totally disregard performance.

in order for success to come its
way, and every gymnast respond-
ed by putting forth her best
effort.

The highlights of the meet
were a career all-around score of
37.65 for senior Karen Jorgensen,
a then career-high all-around
score of 37.9 for senior Kristin
Brown and a then school record
38.35 for Alisha Friend in the all-
around.

Pitt began the meet, which was
designated as Senior Night, on
vault with a score of 46.15. The
score consisted of performances
by Christine Battista (9.0), Brown
(9.2), Friend (9.4), Meg Johns
(9.3) and Bethany Toellner (9.25).

The next event was the uneven
parallel bars where the team

earned a school record score of
47.20.

The Panthers were represented
by Brown (9.45), Jorgensen (9.4),
Friend (9.75), Toellner (9.15) and
Brenda Stevens (9.45), who saw
her first action since the first meet
of the season when she suffered
an injury. The scores of Friend,
Toellner and Stevens were career
highs.

Beam has been the question-
able event throughout the season,
but not on this day as the team
earned a then season-high score
of 46.50.

Brown (9.5), Deena Daller
(9.05), Friend (9.4), Jorgensen
(9.65) and a career high for Johns
(8.9) racked up impressive
scores.

Going into the final event,

which was floor, the team need-
ed only a total score of 47.05 to
tie the 186.90 mark. But the team
would not settle for a tie. The
team said it wanted the record for
itself finished with a score of
47.65, which was then the season
high.

Commanding performances
were represented by Brown
(9.75), Johns (8.8), Jorgensen
(9.7), Toellner (9.6) and Friend
with a 9.8 for the second time
this season.

Following the meet, team
members said they were excited
but they were not satisfied with
their performance.

“I am pleased with my score,”
Friend said. “But as a team we
know we can do even better.”

The team came out on

with a score of 188.3 against
West Virginia University (190)
and Indiana University of
Pennsylvania (180.3).

On vault the team score was a
46.5 with Battista and Brown
each earning a 9.3, Johns and
Toellner a 9.2 and Friend a career
high 9.50.

The team earned a strong score
of 46.25 despite a few falls. The
competitors on the apparatus
were Toellner (9.15), Stevens
(9.05), Friend (9.05), Shannon
Brown (9.35) and Kristin Brown
(career high 9.65).

The team moved on to beam
where it earned a new team
record of 47.40. Toellner scored a
9.0 and the Panthers got career
highs from Daller (9.45), Friend
(9.5), Jorgensen (9.7) and Kristin
Brown (9.75).

Brown’s and Jorgensen’s scores

were more than simply career
highs. Jorgensen tied the team
record shared by present gymnast
Mikie Myers. But no sooner was
Jorgensen reﬂecting on her per-
formance she had to turn her
attention toward Brown who sur-
prisingly broke her record set just
minutes ago.

Pitt finished the meet on ﬂoor
with a score of 48.15, also a new
team record on this event. The
scores were represented by a sea-
son high for Halovanic (9.25) and
career highs for Toellner (9.65),
Jorgensen (9.7), Friend (9.8) and
Kristin Brown with a 9.75.

Brown’s_ score was good
enough to give her an all-around
score of 38.45, which was a 10th
of a point higher than the record
set by Friend just three days earli-
er.

Tournament Committee
Chairman Tom Butters
answered the question of
Oklahoma’s exclusion by rat-
tling off about how the
Sooners did not beat enough
top 50 teams. He and his com-
mittee only looked at the
record against the top 50,
rather than looking at how
teams perform in those games.
For example, Oklahoma
played at Duke’s Cameron
Indoor Arena on national tele-
vision and battled the Blue
Devils to the wire in overtime
before losing. But to the com-
mittee that just shows up as
just another L and nothing
more.

St. Josephs, at 18-10, also
suffered because of the RPI,
ranking only number 70 on
that list. But if any member of
that committee would have
watched a St. Joe’s game this
season, they’d have a hard
time keeping the Hawks out of
the field. There aren’t many
' :ams in the country that do
nore with what they have than
St. ]oe’s. No size, no depth —
just 40 minutes of guts and
heart every night. But those
are silly intangibles. Again, no
consideration of performance,
just the cold, hard numbers.

Alotting a predetermined
number of slots to conferences
is another problem. Butters
made no bones about the fact

that the Big West would
receive just two bids, regard-
less of the circumstances, so
when Long Beach State upset
UNLV and then New Mexico
State, Vegas was left at home.
That seems a bit unrealistic
and also shows the lack of
respect that some deserving
leagues get.

If slotting is in effect, then it
should at least be consistent,
and SMU should be out of the
field. The Mustangs were the
regular season champ in
Southwest Conference and
were upset in the tourney. but
the SWC is horrible, so one bid
 all it deserved.

Until the selection process is
revamped. expect more prob-
lems in the future. Speaking of
problems.

-Whats up with the bracke-
teering ring they have going in
Chapel Hill? North Carolina
gets yet another cakewalk
region, not unlike two years
ago when the Tar Heels
marched through the “Dean
Smith Invitational” in the East.

Meanwhile, Indiana, 21 team
that performed at a superior
level to anybody all season,
gets strapped with both Duke
and Kansas in the Midwest,
not to mention a dangerous
crew from Louisville. The
Hoosiers looked unbeatable
until Alan Henderson went
down, but now they get a
minefield. It would be pretty

easy to replace Duke or
Kansas with Vanderbilt or
Massachusetts and balance the
regions a little bit.

Olnjuries will determine the
National Champion this season
more than any year in recent
memory. Four legitimate title
contenders have their hopes
on hold right now. Of that
quartet, the Hoosiers appear to
be in the most trouble.
Henderson’s left knee is not
progressing much at all and
his season appears to be over.
It would be a shock if he steps
on the floor, even in later
rounds. The Hoosiers are
nowhere near the same team
without the lanky 6—foot—9-inch
rebounding machine and will
be forced to lean on Calbert
Cheaney even more.

-Duke is also holding its
breath. Grant Hill played on
his injured foot in the Devils’
ACC Tourney loss to Georgia
Tech Friday, but it was obvi-
ous that he did not have his
majestic leaping ability and
explosive step. Duke needs
Hill back at close to 100 per-
cent to have any hope of mak-
ing it six straight final fours or
three straight championships. .

-North Carolina lost to
Georgia Tech in Sunday’s ACC
Tournament Championship,
but the Heels were without
Derrick Phelps, their point
guard and defensive catalyst.

have had all season,” head coach
Deb Yohman said. “But the real
test to determine how good this
team is will be to go a third time
in a row with such high scores.”

Yohman’s team did just that
when its members travelled to
North Carolina State and earned a
convincing score of 187.15,
which helped the team receive a
spot in the ECACS and all but
guaranteed it an invitation to
regionals.

On vault the team earned a
46.6, which ties the..t,eam record.
The event was highlighted by
career—high scores for Kristin
Brown and Daller each with a
9.4, Battista (9.35) and Johns
(9.5).

The score on bars was 46.8,
highlighted by more career-high
scores from Daller (90), Shannon
Brown (9.45) and Jorgensen
(9.5). Tying their career highs
were Toellner (9.15) and Kristin
Brown (9.65).

The next event was beam,
where the team compiled a score
of 45.60. The top performers
were Toellner (9.15), Jorgensen
(9.45) and Myers (9.45), who
returned to the lineup after miss-
ing several meets due to the ﬂu.

Pitt finished its record setting
week on floor with a score of
48.15, which ties the team record.
The competitors were Johns
(9.25) and Halovanic (9.35), each
with career highs.

Toellner tied her best effort
with a 9.65, and Friend tied her
career high for the fourth time
with a 9.80. Jorgensen and Kristin
Brown finished with a 9.65 and
9.7, respectively.

game against the Pirates. He hit
a routine double-play ground
ball — an easy 6-4-3, but
limped so badly into first that
Pirate Gary Redus called for the
double-play to be stopped and
the ball to be held, as not to
show up what was once one of
the toughest guys to double—up
on in the majors.

An empty season and an artiﬁ-
cial hip later, Jackson began, last
week, to showcase his unbeliev-
able skills at the Sox’ spring
training park in Sarasota, Fla.
He and fellow White Sox star
Ozzie Guillen, also of 1992 dis-
abled list fame, took some
groundballs and hit a little in the
cage. And then Bo stepped on
the basepaths.

Gone is the pathetic limp that
put an end to his 1992 come-
back and sent him to the operat-
ing table. Though not full speed,
he is running with the grace and
power that we have come to
expect from the former two-
sport star and Heisman Trophy
winner. And I’ve got some news
for y’all: Bo is back.

Baseball has not been nearly
as much fun without Bo. Plays
of the Week on “SportsCenter”
and “This Week In Baseball”
featured Micky Morandini and
Andy Stankaweicz last year. No
Bo going over the wall. No Bo
robbing someone of a sure dou-
ble in the gap. No Bo gunning
down a runner at the plate. A
great play may be a great play,
but when Bo is in it, it becomes
21 “Honey, come-here, you’ve-
GOT-to-see-this” play.

A home run is a home run,
but a B0 home run comes at the
most opportune time. Try lead-
ing off the All-Star game against
one of the National League’s
best pitchers and parking an
offering that should not have
even been swung at onto the
black tarp in the Oakland
Alameda Coliseum.

But aside from his talent on
the field, his marketability has
been sorely missed. How many
sports figures can walk around
with only one name? Mario.
Magic. Shabq} Wayne. Bo.

Since his injury, we have had
only one decent Bo commercial:
the Dennis Leary “and-what-are-
you—doing-with-your-good-hip?
Watching commercials!” spot
that showed the rehabilitating
B0 on the bike, in the pool and
under the weights.

We’ve had to tolerate stark
amateurism during our 30-sec-
ond ad spots since Bo’s depar-
ture. I was relieved to see
Christmas finally end —- no
more Deion Sander Claus. No
more Barkley vs. Godzilla. No
more Dee Brown jumping over
the Empire State Building.

And even now- Barry Sanders?
Come on, that’s just a poor
adaptation of NFL Films’ Joe
Namath vs. the Baltimore Colts
short.

They’ve all had their turn to
hawk their goods. Bo has
returned and he’s got all of
Madison Avenue riding on his
back, from his pool to your liv-
ing room to the bank. Bo’s
back.

The odds are stacked against

a full-out comeback. Physicians
say that after receiving an artiﬁ-
cial hip, patients are lucky to
even walk this soon in their
rehabilitation. But hey, I’m not
about to put anything past him.
Brian Bozworth thought that he
could tackle Bo in the open
ﬁeld, with Bo just coming
around the end and the Boz in
perfect position to make the
play. I don’t think that they’ve’
picked Boz up off of the field
yet. And hey, without Bo who
will Dick Shapp have to inter-
view every week?

Phelps hurt his lower back

on a hard fall against

Virginia and should be
ready this weekend. The
Tar Heels need him at his
ball-hawking best, applying
intense pressure to the bas-

ketball at all times.

-Finally, Florida State.
The Seminoles have lost just
two games when Charlie
Ward is in the lineup, run-
~ ning the show. He separat-
ed his shoulder twice this
season, and although he

returned for the ACC
Tourney, that is no guaran-
tee with Ward.

He has been snake-bitten
for two years, and every
time his health seems to

return, he goes down again.

Ward went down in last‘
year’s tourney, denying the
‘Noles a Final Four shot. If
he stays healthy, watch out
for FSU.
