REBECCA R:DDLE/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Maa Angelou helps a sold-out crowd understand the importance of poetry.

 
 
  
   
   

Why the caged

bird recites poetry  

Christal Hall

Staff Writer

“Poetry is a ‘hero or
shero’ of our world, but
unfortunately too many
teachers use poetry as
punishment to our kids
when it’s really a
reward,” said Dr. Maya
Angelou.

Angelou spoke last
night at the Carnegie
Music Hall about poetry
———its importance to her
and to everyone else.

When Angelou
walked onto the stage,
she recited one of her

 poems and sang “I open

my mouth to the Lord
and I won’t turn back oh

99

no.

She encouraged stu-
dents to recite poetry
every day, even if it
means closing the door
and saying it in front of
the mirror. She said peo-
ple should carry a poem
in their pocket to make
them laugh. After all, the
people who don’t laugh
— and call themselves
“serious” —— tend to be
boring, Angelou said.

.‘‘I don’t trust people
who don’t smile.”

She recited poetry
about the slavery days
when some black people
were called “Uncle
Toms.” The chorus of the
poem stated “We wear

the masks and yet we
smile.”

“They kept my race
alive,” Angelou said, “by
wearing the masks.”

Angelou reminisced
about her childhood. She
was three years old when
her parents sent her and
her older brother to
Stamps, Ark., to live with
her grandmother.

“Mama [her grand-
mother] always told me
to never accept a shirt
from a naked person,”
Angelou said, joking.

She lived with her
grandmother until the age
of seven, but was uproot-
ed again to go live with

Philadelphia's best

chance cal ‘culture’

Across the Nation

PHILADELPHIA — The future of
Philadelphia is in Rafael Vmoly’s hands.

At least that is what fans of the arts
say. .
He is the architect charged with not
only designing a new performing arts
center, but also with coming up with a
ﬁve-star plan that will help secure the
money to build it.

There are only seven months left
until groundbreaking, and fundraisers
are still at least $70 million short of the
$220 million they need to build a world-
class performing arts center.

Vmoly is set to unveil his plan next
week.

The New York architect gained
worldwide attention for his design of the
Tokyo International Forum. Now
Philadelphia officials are hoping he can
do the same at the comer of Broad and
Spruce streets.

Arts supporters hope the new facili-
ty will restore the city’s reputation as a
national culture center. . .

The 2,500 seat ball will house the
world—renowned Philadelphia Orchestra.
Smaller theaters will be used for the
Pennsylvania Ballet and other perform-
ing arts groups.

PITTSBURGH — Pennsylvania’s state
universities and community colleges are
talking about a merger in an eﬁort to
save money and improve the education
they deliver to students. The combina-
tion would link 14 universities in the
state system with 15 community colleges
and serve more than 200,000 students.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. —— President
Clinton is kicking off what he hopes will
be a national dialogue on Social
Security. ‘

At a town hall meeting in Kansas
City, Mo., Clinton said this is a good
time for the nation. But, he said it is not
a time to rest.

Clinton says Americans must reach
across the generations and come up with
a way to keep the govemment-rim pen-
sion system from going bankrupt in the
next century.

There were plenty of people gath-
ered for the debate, including some who
are already getting Social Security
checks, like Betty and Owen Miller.

Mr. Miller says he would like to see
some partial privatization of the system.
He thinks it would be a good way to pre-
serve the system.

CINCINNATI — Publisher Larry Flynt
has been indicted on obscenity charges
in Cincinnati.

It is the same city where he was con-

victed in 1977 for distributing his
“Hustler” magazine.

Prosecutors say Flynt and his broth-
er, Jimmy, have been indicted on 15
counts each —— including pandering
obscenity. They are charged with selling
an obscene videotape to a 14-year-old
boy in Flynt’s downtown store, and with
a pattern of selling materials that offi-
cials call obscene.

_ If convicted of all charges, they
could be sentenced to up to 24 years in
prison and a $30,000 fine.

Flynt’s 1977 conviction was thrown
out on appeal.

In October, he opened a bookstore in
downtown Cincinnati and has chal-
lenged authorities by selling “Hustler”
along with adult videos and sex toys.

ALBION, Ill. — Illinois investigators
now believe a man who was a suspect in
a shooting rampage that killed four peo-
ple was shot to death by his partner in
crime.

The 19-year-old was buried yester-
day, four days after he was found dead in
a ﬁeld as police closed in. Authorities
initially believed Chalk Wessell had
killed himself.

Ofﬁcials now say evidence shows
Wessell may have died when Steven
Hale shot him. They are awaiting further
forensic tests.

One person survived the shootings
that began in Indiana and crossed over
into Illinois.

Officials are looking into the possi-
bility of the death penalty for the 21-
year-old Hale. He is being held on $1
million bond.

Around the World

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA —-
Australia’s wildlife authorities face a
dilemma — how to preserve the Dingo
and still keep people safe.

One of the wild dogs attacked a 13-.
month—old girl Saturday night on Fraser
Island, off the coast of eastern Australia.
The animal dragged the child several
feet from her family’s camp before the
girl’s father woke up and scared the
Dingo off.

It was the third Dingo attack in ﬁve
weeks at the popular camping area.

There have also been reports of
packs of Dingos circling tourists on the
island.

The environment minister for .1

Queensland says he does not want to
remove the animals from their native
habitat. He says humans just have to take
extra precautions.

The state has already moved croco- V

diles out of populated areas in northern
Queensland.

MAYA

the maternal side of her family in St.
Louis. _

Angelou said she remembers how
sophisticated they were and how they
never dropped “g’s” from words like
“looking.”

“They were so sophisticated they
ate bologna,” Angelou said in a sophis-
ticated French accent.

Shortly after she arrived in St.
Louis to live with that part of her fami-
ly, her mothers’ boyfriend raped her.
She told her family, and the police
arrested him. _

Angelou then reminisced of hear-
ing the news of his release — the next
night.

“My brother and I were playing
‘mama poli’ [monopoly]” Angelou said
joking, “we weren’t told how to pro-
nounce the name.”

Later that evening she was told the
man was found kicked to death.

“I thought that my words had killed
him so I stopped speaking,” Angelou
said. “I thought my voice would kill
people.” ‘”

After one month, her mother sent
Angelou back to Stamps to live with
her grandmother. Apparently, her moth-
er couldn’t handle little Maya getting in
the way of her lavish lifestyle.

“Mama know when the good Lord
is ready, you’ll be a preacher or
teacher,” said Angelou, going back and
reiterating the ﬁrst thing her grand-
mother told her upon her arrival.

The rape so traumatized her that
she remained mute for six years —— until
a woman named “Miss Culture Lady”
prompted her to speak.

“She was every race. You could
tell, she had a falsetto,” Angelou said,
referring to Miss Culture Lady’s ability

FROM PAGE 1

THE PITT NEWS

to change the tone of her voice for each
different person she met.

Angelou said Miss Culture Lady
put her kids in every talent show she
could, despite their obvious wishes to
not be there.

But Miss Culture Lady always

made it very clear she felt Angelou did-

n’t belong in the company of her extra-
ordinary children.

“I thought that if I could only
speak, I would show them,” Angelou
said not knowing that the first words
she would speak would be of a poem.

Poetry became Angelou's voice,
reciting it in her mind, when she
stopped speaking. She said at the ages
of six and seven she would remember
poetry by Edgar Allen Poe, Paul
Laurence Dunbar and William
Shakespeare.

“My voice never left me, I left it,”
Angelou said.

She had a glow in her eyes as she
spoke of a childhood teacher.

“One of my teachers told me that I
will never truly love poetry until I say
it,” Angelou said.

That was enough for her to return
home and recite one of her favorite
poems by Dunbar — the ﬁrst time
she’d spoken out loud in six years. That
day she decided that she’d recite one of
Shakespeare’s sonnets at the next
school talent show.

“I had to tell mama that
Shakespeare was white,” Angelou said.
“It was going to get out sooner or later.”

Angelou’s grandmother objected
and told her to recite a poem by a black
writer. She cracked, and recited a poem
by Paul Lawrence Dunbar instead.

“When I physically and emotional-
ly left the condition called Stamps,
Ark.,” Angelou said, “I found myself
and I will continue to find myself as
long as I live.”

Don't rob children of  

,9 their chance to grow up

Just when we thought our country's grade schools
were making progress toward becoming better educa-
tors —— with computers in classrooms and redesigned
curriculums meant to keep up with a rapidly changing
world — we ﬁnd out that they're not really evolving after"
an

They're phasing out recess.

This is a really dumb idea

Children learn a lot about life, society and other peo-
ple by interacting on their own terms in unstructured set-
tings. But elementary schools across the country have
begun to remove that opportunity for personal growth
from the kids‘ schedules, The New York Times reported
yesterday. -

Remember the kids who kept to themselves during
recess, who were too shy to interact with ﬂre other kids?
Remember how much longer it took them to make
ﬁiends? Remember how unprepared they were for deal-
ing with social situations?

Shyness wasn't the reason for kids being socially
clumsy. The problem developed because ﬂre shy kids
didn't get much practice interacting with other people.

Elementary school is the only place) where most
children get to interact with a lot of other kids. They
might make a few friends with whom they interact after
school (though they're less likely to make friends with-
out a recess period), but a schoolyard provides the
opportunity for children to begin to deal with many other
people.

Social interaction is quite possibly the most impor-
tant skill that people in our civilization need to know.

When children don't know how to interact with their
peers, how to resolve quarrels and behave humanely
toward each other, they resort to imitating whatever else
they know about human interaction. When that happens
to be adults killing each other on TV and in movies, it's
no wonder kids come to school with guns and try to kill
anybody with whom they have a disagreement.

Recess is where boys are supposed to learn how to
tell jokes and pick teams. It's where girls are supposed to
learn that boys don't have cooties.

Ifteachers are worried thatthey need more time to
teach children the skills needed for a rapidly changing
world, perhaps they should spend more of their own
time planning classes instead of relaxing in the teachers‘
lounge.

Perks of driving in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania has a large number
of traﬂic laws that out-of-state people
just don’t know about Because our
glorious state has existed ‘since
William Penn and his buddies ﬁrst
rode into this woodland region in a
tightly spaced line of several hundred
horses in 1681, (thus the ﬁrst docu-

' mented instance of honest—to-God

tailgating) the rules of the road have
been a rather haphazard and random-
ly documented phenomenon.

For example, if you’ve lived in
Pemrsylvania more than a year, you
have probably heard about the leg-
endary “Pennsylvania Rolling Stop”
exception. This law —— which states
that any stop sign with a white border
is optional —- is a cherished tradition
practiced throughout the common-
wealth. For a textbook example of
how it works, walk beside the Pit
Theater across from the Law School
building and try to cross the street
between the three stop signs. You

can’t. Why? Because it is what we '

like to call a “ﬂowing intersection.”
No one stops. Why? All three stops
signs all have white borders, silly!
You won’t ﬁnd this rule written
down anywhere in the PA State codes,
either. Why? Well, quite frankly, it’s
because it has a white border, too.
Pemrsylvania drivers —— a very
adaptive species — have developed a
highly intricate set of these sorts of
laws and exceptions. A classic is the
“Spirit of the Sign” exception. As long
as drivers adhere toithe general princi-
ple for which the trafﬁc sign was
placed in its spot, any maneuver is
le.
Thislawhasledtoourfrequent
practice of such things as backing up
one-way streets. As long as the vehi-
cle is facing the proper direction, we
reason, what could possibly be ille-

' gal?

MARC
Nuzzo

Corummsr

 

For anyone who says that we

Pennsylvanians disregard our laws,

just direct them to the nearest “No
Parking” sign, and the corresponding
vehicle parked underneath it. We take
our laws so seriously that we are will-
ing to place our vehicle over that spot
just to ensure no one will park there. I
believe you would be hard-pressed to
ﬁnd similar state pride anywhere!
Another example is our “Lines, I
don’t need no stinking lines” law. This
law states that the lines on all city,
country and interstate roadways are
placed there for two basic reasons: 1)
to govern the ﬂow of traﬂic on’ our
incredibly immense parking zones
and 2) because they look really pretty.
(In a similar fashion, the Pemrsylvania
Department of Transportation devel-
oped the “Caution: PED X-ing” signs.
Because there is no such thing as a
“PED,” and “X-ing” isn’t a word,
these signs are strictly for their retro-
l970’s cosmetic appeal.)
Pemrsylvania is unique because it
is the only state in the nation to have

more than 4,000 square miles of con- I

tinuous public parking. If you have
ventured along our roadways dining
the year, you will notice that drivers
are apparently allowed to stop their
cars,getoutandret1nnanytimewith-
in a year or two.

Pennsylvania drivers respond in
one of several ways. The ﬁrst is to
stop behind the car, check for any
oncoming trafﬁc and upon seein ’

_none,passthecartoitsleft.'Iheoth

is to stop behind the car, check for any

THE PITT NEWS

oncoming traﬂic, step out from their
car and proceed to smash the
“parked” vehicle with any device they
would normally use to ﬁx a ﬂat tire.
They then retum to their vehicle and
pass to the left.

The only way to prevent this sec-
ond fate from happening is by follow-
ing the “Hazard lights don’t kill peo-
ple, people kill people” law. You can
see this law — which states hazards
lights make any vehicular maneuver
acceptable — in effect almost every-
where. If you need, for example to
double park, which isn’t really double
parking at all (see “Lines ...” law
above) just tum on your hazard lights.
If you are suddenly overcome by the
desire to drive tight circles in the rnid—
dle of any ‘major state highway, don’t
be bashful! Just turn on your hazard
lights! It’s OK, the Commonwealth
understands. o

How could we ever overlook the
“I’m bigger than you, you scrawny
(expletive)” law? In any situation
where one of two vehicles must yield
to the right of way, it’s always the
smaller one that must comply. If a
smaller vehicle attempts to challenge
the larger vehicle for the right of way
and succeeds, there is also a law stat-
ingthatthisvictory mustbemarked
with an ancient virility ritual involving
the driver being coated in Penn Motor
oil, being spanked with a worn piece
of tire treading and then ritually heat-
ing a tractor trailer with that same
piece of tire.

And no matter what you say or
how bizarre you may consider
Pennsylvanian drivers to be, at least
we all drive on the right side of the
road.

Unless our hazard lights are on.

Man‘ Nuzzo’s hazard lights have
always been on.

that turns a calm day at the ballyard
into a gathering of rabid, pennant-
thirsty fanatics.

Rabid, pennant-thirsty fanatics
are what teams count on for support

, in the latter stages of the season,

Zwhen all could be riding on one

 pitch, and postseason berths slip

l the Pitt baseball team —-— the fellas

i relegated to Trees Field, buried
behind the Cost Center, oblivious to
fans both rabid and non-rabid.

It is midway through their sea-
’ son, strange as it sounds. They have
; already played 20 games in 1998.

V“ And right now, they could use a
 little help. The team is currently 1-
: 8 in the Big East Conference and
will need somewhat of a minor mir-
acle to make the league’s postsea-
son tournament, which includes
;,only four of the 11 schools enrolled
E in Big East baseball.

Because of where they play and
gwhen they play — weekends, start-

For Fran Davis, there was

After the win, she

two courts away.

She did it with a 6-2, 6-2

But up 2-1 in the first set

Davis quickly took the advan-

“I had to get used to play-

Meyers keeps busy as student-athlete-leader

Matt Grove

Staff Writer

Being a student-athlete is often
more demanding than a full-time job.
One must perform not only in
front of teachers and classmates in
order to remain eligible, but also
must give another performance in
front of coaches and fans to keep his
or her spot on the team.

On the other hand, student-lead-
ers have a similarly demanding task.
Just like the athletes, they carry the
weight of a full-time course load on
his shoulders. But after the day is
done in the classroom, they have
meetings and conferences and bud-
geting sessions that help determine

. campus life for all students.

The lives of either one of these
students is hectic to say the least.

There may not be an adjective to
describe the life of junior Kelly
Meyers.

Meyers not only is the captain of
the Pittsburgh Lady Panthers volley-
ball team — a perennial power in the
Big East Conference —— but shealso

serves as a member of Pitt’s Student
Government Board.

Why would a student who spends
three months in the fall rising for
volleyball practice, before the sun
comes up give up her free time for
the rest of the academic calendar?

“The roots of SGB began last
year when I was outwith an injured
foot and it looked as if I would have
to get surgery on my other foot as
well,” Meyers said. “I thought maybe
the injuries could be career-ending
and I started getting scared.

“Most student-athletes don’t
think about life after playing and it’s
hard to realize that in most cases they
aren’t going to be playing the sport
professionally for the rest of their
lives. So I thought, ‘What am I going
to do?"”

Meyers got involved in SGB last -

year as a member of the Community
Relations Committee, eventually
becoming the co-chair.

The Butler, Pa., native realized
how large a time commitment being
a campus leader was, but said that
she found her niche serving the stu-

dents.

Over the past two years, SGB at
Pitt has been less than squeaky clean,
an image Meyers feels can" be
changed.

“What happened over the past
couple years is part of the reason I
ran for board,” she said. “They were
under constant scrutiny and I thought
that there had to be more to it than
just what we heard about or read in
the papers.”

Meyers felt that she could help
bring the SGB back to where it
should be —-— fulfilling student needs
and staying in the public eye, both
without controversy. ’

.Before Meyers decided to offi-
cially place her name on the ballot
and start changing the way people
look at SGB, she had to get permis-
sion from her coach.

“I immediately encouraged her to
go for it,” Alvear said." “I encourage
new challenges outside of our sport
for our athletes, especially academic
ones like this. She had a great oppor-
tunity to get involved with _a real

YSU falls to Panther offense
Three homers pace Fill‘ in 8-7 victory

Kevln Lilley

Sports Editor

After being held to seven runs
in three games last weekend, the
Pitt baseball team was due for an
offensive outburst.

They delivered.

On the strength of home runs by
Lou Melucci, Jason Oliver and
David Hoopes, the Panthers scored

eight runs in one game on Tuesday,

surviving a late  
Y o u n g s t o w n
State rally to
defeat the
Penguins 8-7.
All bats were
silent early in the
game, as the
teams stayed
scoreless through
the first three
innings. In the
fourth, Melucci
ended the
drought, drilling
a one-out homer
to give Pitt the 1-
0 lead. _
Youngstown
would answer in

starting pitcher
Eric Rosing —
the eventual game—winner —
allowed a run thanks to a single, a
double and a run-scoring ground-
out.

Rosing left the game after five
and two-thirds innings, after giving
up two YSU singles in the top of the
sixth. Reliever Jason Schultz
stepped in to get the final out of the
inning, keeping the score tied at one
apiece moving to the bottom of the
frame.

In the bottom of the inning,
Panther bats broke loose.

Melucci, who went 2-3 with
three runs scored in the contest, led
off the inning with a double. He

moved to third on a groundout, then
scored on Chris Delsignore’s RBI
single.

One batter later, Delsignore _

would reach the plate thanks to
Hoopes’ homer, making the score 4-
1.

The Pitt catcher had two RBI at
bat, but committed what could have

been a costly error in the field dur- \

ing the eighth inning. A misplayed

ball by the backstop allowed a

Penguin runner
on third to
score, starting a

inning runs
would hold, but just barely.
Youngstown rallied in the ninth,
scoring two runs off Pitt’s third
pitcher of the day, righty reliever
Scott Schultz.

Scott, a 6-foot-4 freshman,
eventually overpowered the
Penguins, coaxing a groundout for
the final out of the game and earn.-
ing his first save of the season.

Tomorrow, the Panthers take on

ence matchup, scheduled for 3 p.m.

unnoticed by baseball fans prepar-
‘ ing for Pirate Opening Day revel-

ry.

Fans missed Pitt Head Coach
Joe Jordano’s fit of late—inning
heroics, arguing a call with the
home plate umpire until he was
finally tossed from the contest.

Then, he really got angry.

“Bump me again!” he yelled to
the arbiter, a good five inches
shorter than Jordano. “Bump me
again! I’ll stand up for my team!”

The coach left the field to
cheers from the dugout. It was
great theater. A bit disturbing,
when read out of context, but great
theater.

And the game itself was great
baseball, even though the Panthers
weren’t exactly on the right end of
the scoresheet. St. John’s hurler
Robert O’Connor, already drafted
by the Atlanta Braves, started the
contest throwing 88-mph fastballs.

He finished throwing 92-mph
fastballs, complemented by break-
ing pitches that nearly hit Pitt bat-
ters in the shoulder before hanging
a sharp right and nicking a corner
of the strike zone.

O’Connor’s complete—game
performance reminded those in
attendance why even 1-0 baseball
games can be fun to watch.
Watching the bitter battle the
pitcher, enjoying the mind games
of managers and umpires and
applauding the slick fielding of
players like Pitt’s Lou Melucci and

Harry Ciavarella makes baseball
the greatest game on the planet.

But fans don’t want to watch
games on patches of uneven grass
like Trees Field.

They don’t want to walk up the
hill at noon on Saturday.

It’s too much work. 8"

Well, fans are in luck.

Next Saturday, April 18, the
Panthers travel to Three Rivers
Stadium to take on Notre Dame, in
one of only a few home games this
season that will be played on a
field with more than one set of
bleachers.

A Panther-Irish doubleheader
will take place immediately fol-
lowing the 1:35 matinee between
the Pirates and the San Diego
Padres.

The Irish are perennial powers
and have dominated Big East play
since joining the league in 1995.
The Panthers will need all sorts of
rabid fans to help them in a last-
ditch attempt to reach the
promised land —— a ticket to the
Big East Baseball Championship
in Connecticut in the middle of
May.

The Panthers play four games
at Three Rivers (April 15, 16, 18,
19), but Saturday will be the only
time a Pirate game comes along
with the PAT bus ride to Three
Rivers.

No more excuses —— time to
watch the Panthers go to work.

With the win, Shalbrack
moved her career victory total to
76. Only a junior, she stands to
challenge Davis’ new mark in her
senior season; Davis began her
senior year with 85 victories, and
Shalbrack has two meets and a Big
East Championship left to play as
a junior.

Still, Dieffenbach said Davis

has “a good chance to set that
record out there,” especially con-

two decades to fall.

Other individual winners on
the day included Amanda Hoffman
and Bucher, who each earned
straight—set singles victories to
compliment their 9-8 doubles win
earlier in the meet.

Alvear did have some apprehen-
sion, though, that her captain could
be spreading herself too thin.

“I know how demanding some-
thing like SGB can be and I was wor-
ried that with volleyball, it would be
like working two full-time jobs and
going to school for Kelly. She has
been great, however, and she has a
great support staff from her team,
coaching staff and the athletic
department in general. She has
impacted the students on a broad
scale and I couldn’t be happier for
her.”

The team responded in a similar
fashion.

“All of my teammates were
great,” Meyers said her tone becom-
ing upbeat. “Everyone on the team
wore my buttons and helped me cam-
paign the whole time.

“Athletes from other teams
helped out, too. We [athletes] are like
a great big fraternity or sorority. We
stick together, support each other,
and I know that all of the support
helped me get elected.”

Since being elected to SGB, one
of Meyers’ goals is starting to take
shape: motivating other student—ath-

would have to take more classes dur-
ing the summer,” she said.

That doesn’t mean the legislative
dreams that Meyers holds will be
placed on the back burner when sum-
mer blossoms.

SGB President Alyson Wallach is
excited about the progress Meyers
has made in her short time as a board
member.

“Kelly is simply a fantastic board
member, and on top of that she’s an
excellent representative for the stu-
dents here at Pitt,” said the president.
“She is always busy working on pro-
jects for the entire student body,
mainly the Pittsburgh Pride cam-
paign for next fall. She is the queen
of the human logo that is slated for
display at Homecoming in October.”

Meyers will spend the summer
not only getting back on track in
school, but also continuing her SGB
work.

“Being on campus all summer
will allow me to be even more
involved in programs that we are
working on for next year,” Meyers
said, “like the Homecoming bonfire,
pregame bashes in- the fall and many

others.”

Meyers has nothing but kudos for
the SGB and has, in the short time
she’s been a member, realized that
this opportunity is one that she can’t
led slide away. :

“I’ve had an amazing time so far.
I have learned a lot about myself and
what I want to do with my life,”
Meyers said. “I don’t necessarily
want to be a politician, but if for no
other reason, being on board has
given me the opportunity to improve
relationships with all people — fam-
ily, friends and teammates.”
