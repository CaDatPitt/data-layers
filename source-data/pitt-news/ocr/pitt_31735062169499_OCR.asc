  ‘Speak Your Peace’ 

C0111TIl11t€1”S Strat-egY   - Seeks Support

by PAT BORKOWSKI

“The greatest Student Pow-
er possible could be fashion-
ed out of the mass of commut-
er students here at the Univer-
sity,” said Jack LaPietra. head
of the Commuters Association
for the 1968-69 academic year.
“The commuters are often called
apathetic. but actually they are
untapped potential.

“At the first Commuter Asso-
ciation meeting. the attendance
is great. but gradually it dwin-
dles off. and that's the end of the
Commuter Association." LaPie-
tra commented. "In the past there
has been nothing to sustain the
commuters interest because the
Association was concerned main-
ly with long-range projects like
an improved bus schedule and en-
larged parking facilities. It's not
that the commuters aren't inter-
ested in these problems. or expect
them to be solved in one day."
LaPietra explained. "The real
problem is in organizing one mass
into committees and subcommit-
tees to effectively meet these
problems.‘

In order to make the Commut-
er’s Association more representa-
tive this year, students will be
divided into smaller groups, de-
termined by their geographical
area. With enough student sup-
port and the co-operation’ of the
.Port Transit Authority, students
from one area could decide on a
place and time to meet and be
bussed directly to the University.

"Smaller groups can lead to

better communication within the
commuter circle.“ feels LaPietra.
“Students would be encouraged

 

st-» :4 «M ¢°*~!-'M-

]ack LaPietra

to get together with others from
their own area. They could elect
their own officers. decide on per-
tinent issues. and then present
their views to the entire Commut-
er's Association for action.

“Small groups would also be
easier to integrate into other Uni-
versity activities.“ according to
LaPietra. For example. commut-
ers hold an equal part with the
Greeks and Men's Dorm Council
in planning activities and staff'-
ing judicial board for the Men's
Council. LaPietra said. “I‘m of-
ten asked to suggest names of
commuters for Men‘s Council
and other activities. but in as
large an organization at the Com-

‘muter's Association. I don’t have.

the opportunity to know who is
interested in what."

 

 

This year the Commuter’s As-
sociation is co-sponsoring activ-
ities with the Student Union
Board in the hope of making com-
muters more aware that activities
are not only for dorm students,
but also for them. LaPietra men-
tioned that Jim Ranii, chief co-
ordinator of the Student Union
Board, has commuted for four
years himself. '

In order to diminish commuter
inconvenience. Carnegie-Mellon
University has provided dorm-like
facilities for commuters to use
during the day. To combat the
parking problem. CMU has a uni-
versity-owned parking lot. V

“Something of this nature is
being planned for the Student
Union. but the Commuters Asso-
ciation should be the one to arti-
culate these demands." asserted
LaPietra. "It's not Student Gov-
vernment‘s job or the faculties.
it's ours. Maybe we can even pe-
tition for commuter priority in
scheduling until better arrange-
ments are made.“

The Commuters Association
even has a new administrative ad-
visor this year. Replacing Dean
McGibbony is. Ludwig, Hayden,
who, according to LaPietra, “has
some terrific ideas and the drive
to put them through.”

Yet the Commuter Association

. does, not plan to abandon long

range projects such as parking
and bus facilities. but hopes rath
er to maintain interest by “keep-
ing something going all_ the
time.” But LaPietra added. “We
can’t. do anything until we prove
the commuters are interested.”

The “Speak Your Peace" Con-
ference, ‘scheduled for Oct. 12
seeks student support. The con-
ference, and other similar confer-
ences that will be set up in the
future, may very wéll decide the
future of this institution.

The problems of this Universi-
ty are to be discussed on a face
to face confrontation with admin-
istrators and educators. Suggest-
ed topics include.

—Social Regulations: The dis-
cussion of curfews. sign-out sys-
tems, Men’s Housing regulations,

and Judicial Boards, including’

fraternity and sorority social
rules.

—Academic Requirements: Lan-
guage requirements, Distribution
of Studies, course evaluation, and
the counseling system.

~Admission Policy: This could

cover the role‘ of the administra-
tive staff. ‘entrance requirements
and the policy concerning black
students.

The. conference will also in-
clude a discussion of these ques-.
tions:

—Does Student Government rep-
resent the student body?

—Should academic credits be
given for non-academic activities.

—Should reform be fomented
by the administration?

Where should the impetus for
this reform li'e?,_ T ~ R ’

Island Visit Proves
Relaxing To Author

By ALAN BARR

Freeport, Grand Bahama is not
only a_ nice place to visit. but an
expensive one. The community is’
quite new, and as a result, there
are a limited number of things to
do. But still, people come to
“taste” an island. On a weekend.
you can actually have difficulty

in making _a plane

    
 

 Miami airport sells
35* for about twenty-
seven dollars.

As you approach the island from
the ~-air, you get' an eye full of
green trees and concentric bands
of blue water. After going
through customs, which is no pro-
blem for an American Citizen.
you must catch a cab to your ho-
tel. Although the cabs were pri-
vately owned, prices were pre-set
by an island council.

For eleven dollars per night.
my room turned out to be a pri-
vate single with air conditioning
and private bath. This was about
the only thing I felt was not ex-
pensive. Food on ‘the other hand
was costly. The restaurants I tried
were all quite good but it was
difficult to find a place to get
a snack or a small dinner. Because
of this my meals were often ex-
pensive if only because I had to

_ buy more than I wanted. Desserts
were usuallyvextra and menus
very limited.

The island brochure advertis-
ed “exciting shopping” without
duty. As it turned out, the only
place you could shop was at the
International Bazaar. Here, in a to-
tally new complex, stores sold
goods from all over the world.
If you wanted something orien-
tal, you wandered through the com-
plex until you found yourself in

what resembled a street from old
China. But the prices weren't old!
The same held true in the old
streets of Spain, India, and Ja-
pan.

One of the Islands two Casino.
was located at the Internation
Bazaar. Both money and a sport
jacket were prerequisites for en-
trance. (1 never did get around
the finding out _ bout an age stip-
ulation.  »‘

I was goingcto rent a Honda
and “explore” the island for eight
dollars a day. Then however. I de-
cided I could never sit on a bike
all day long-besides. in half an
hour, you run out of island. In-
stead. I went “on a “Safari" for

ten dollars. This included a cook-

out on some deserted section of
beach. Our guides supplied
snorkling equipment. and I spent
the day looking at the fish and
weeds on the “ocean floor."

Actually, the water deepened
so gradually that I never found
myself over my head in water.

We had a good day though, and ,

the sun lit the crystal clear water
revealing everything from crabs
to purple “aquarium” fish. On the

x way back to the hotel, we passed

a section of marked of lots. Berk-
ey, my guide, told me they were
set aside for private homes and
tagged between $40,000 —- $60,-
000alot!

I left after four days feeling
sorry for people I had met who
were planning on staying for over
a week. You could easily see every-
ting in two or so days. Ironically.
it cost me two dollars to leave the
country—a “Tourist Tax." From
Miami to Springfield. Massachu-
setts, was the biggest problem.

‘After getting off the plane in

I Miami, we walked for fifteen min-

utes to get to customs. We were

‘Auto Strikes Crowd: 
Two Students Killed,  
  Four Others Injured’

We hope The Pitt News never has to
print this headline; we hope that we never
have the dire situation of having to publish
an obituary of a student hit by an automobile
or truck on either Fifth or Forbes Avenues.
But our hopes may very well be in vain.

For years, members of the University Ad-
ministration and Student Government (SC)
have been attempting to ease the threatening
traffic problem. For years, the main door of

City Hall has been slammed right in their  « V v   -

Schueler was not alone in his concern
about the traffic problem. Chancellor Wesley
Posvar pleaded his case to Miscimarra. But
even the Chancellor’s case seems to have been
ignored.

Miscimarra, however, was kind enough
to send a reply to Schueler. He told Schueler
in a letter dated May 2 that the Bureau of
Traffic Planning was considering the install-

  

We feel the City Government has failed to take the iniative in
this area—they seem to be rather unconcerned about our calamitous
traffic situation. In the context of City Hall’s complacent attitude,
we must lodge a formal complaint against Mayor Barr’s administra-
tion. They have repeatedly ignored the very miniscule request for
the installation of traffic signals. The tragedy of it all is that a hu-
man life may be lost in the interim. A life may be lost not because of

because of an ignorant lack of interest and
distorted sense of priorities on the part of
City Hall. _

A number of University students have

‘nearly been killed on Fifth Avenue near the

Clapp Hall area, and no individual at the
University can idly sit by and wait for the
inevitable. Maybe it’s time for the City Bu-
reaucracy to wake up and meet some of the
needs of the University campus. Maybe its
time for City Hall to open its doors and its
eyes to look at our dire needs.

The Mayor and his staff must look at our
needs and immediately install traffic signals
on Fifth and Tennyson. And we hope the tra-
ditional silence at City Hall will be inter-
rupted by a resounding response. If we fail
to hear from City Hall on our threatening
traffic situation, the students at this Univer-
sity sould use other means to influence our

—--The Different Drummer I ,
Lovely Rita Fills L’il White Book;
Pay Thru The Ear 

Commuters

BRUCE LEVENSON
_ Staff News Editor
The University’s fragment-
ed student power movement
has failed to touch upon one

- vital issue——at least as far as

our umpteen commuting stu-
dents ar_e concerned—parking.

As a fourth term _commuting
student who drives to school every
day, I feel adequately qualified
to comment on this situation.
Parking in Oakland is almost in-
tolerable. grossly unfair. and fur-
thermore I believe that there is
a conspiracy against the student-
a conspiracy to try to ‘make it as
easy as possible to get parking
tickets._ I ' .

TO PROVE my point. I will
cite the “nickels only" meters.
the one and two hour limit me-
ters, and the well-concealed street
cleaning signs on Tennyson and
Lytton Streets.

Why is it that all of the me-
ters on Fifth Avenue accept only
nickles? The meters on the side
streets and in the Carnegie-Hil1-
man Library area will take dimes
and quarters as well as five-cent
pieces. Why weren't these change
meters installed on Fifth Aven-
ue? I'll tell you why. Because if
you have less than four nickles in
your pocket and you plan to oc-
cupy your space for the maxi-
mum two hours you will be ticket-
ed. ~

If you wish to park for four '

hours. which means that you will
have to run back to the meter
sometime to put in more money.
you must have eight nickles. I
think it is unrealistic of the city
to expect people to be carrying so
many nickles with them—and
they know this. At any given
time during a school day. 25 to
40 per cent of all automobiles in
the campus area will have a yel-
low surprise on their windshields.

I have tried to walk the straight
and narrow path of the law. I have
purchased rolls of nickles. I have
hoarded nickels. yet since I have
begun attending the University
I have averaged at least one tag
a week. This has been the result

of two factors. As conscientious
as I have tried to be, I some-
times come up a nickel or two
short. This is because I never know
when I am -going to need a slug
or two for other expenses. The
other factor is overtime.

ONE HALF of the Fifth -Av-
enue meters have a one hour ‘time
limit. The other half allows for
two hours. Bigelow Boulevard’,
O’Hara, Bayard, Bellefield, and
the library area also have two
hour meters. Only the side streets
off of.Fifth Avenue (excluding
Bellefield and the Forbes Field
area have four hour time limits.
But. you have to be awfully damn
lucky to get one of the few four
hour spots.

zen, been able to amass such an...

Student Issues Gain Voices

Editor. The Pitt News

We feel it necessary at this
time to state our views on the cur-
rent Student Power issue. We re-
cognize that change is essential
for the continued growth of any
organization. We also recognize
that the opportunity to suggest
and to help implement change is
an integral part of any democra-
tic institution.

The implication in the present
Student Power issue here at Pitt
is that meaningful change is im-
possible within the present pow-
er structure. We challenge this
statement-.

First, The Student Power ad-
vocates here feel that the Uni-
versity power structure is un-
democratic. Is it any more demo-
cratic for a group of 250 students
(slightly less than '1 per cent of
the student body) to try to force
the administration to accept their
idea of a power structure, when
this change could affect the other
99 per cent of the student body?

We realize that no movement of
any worth would ever begin if a
majority had to decide that it
was necessary. The civil rights
movement is an example.

‘But we feel that a poll of stu-

dent opinion be taken to see if '

the student body really wants
this change.

Secondly, have you tried work-
ing through the present system
of organizations? Don’t tell us
that change is impossible! What
about the pass—fail course op-
tions; honor dorms for women; the
quarter hour curfew system; the
recent retirement of the quarter
hour system in favor of agblanket
2:30 curfew on weekends? These

are all changes of significance
which have come about through
existing student organizations.

Also. you don‘t want mere ad-
visory power. but you are de-
manding decision-making pow-
er. Seriously. do any of you hon-
estly feel that you could. even as
a group. make policy decisions
pertaining to this University?

That" is essentially what de-
cision making power implies.
Even a board of Trustees which
includes some of the finest ad-
ministrative minds in the coun-
try. and a dynamic young
chancellor such as Dr. Posvar,
must feel that it is quite a task.

Even if your demands were
met, do you believe they are real-

ly practical? For instance, if a

legitimate student group arrived
at a decision on some issue and
presented it to the proper admin-
istrative official, your system en-
tails a two week time limit with-
in which action must betaken on
the issue; otherwise it would be-

come university law through de-

fault.

There are at least 30 recogniz-
ed student groups here. Suppose
they all presented a demand (de-
cision) at the same time. If any
were seriously worth consid-
ering, two weeks would be an im-
possible time in which to study
them and come to a decision.

Student Power people, do not
be too hasty in labellinglanyone

_ not joining your group as “Apa-

thetic.” Chances are they simply
disagree with your ideas on the

issue, as we do. Why not have a

As a member of the’Editorial Board of the Pitt
News, and a Pitt student, I cannot print words strong
enough to express my disgust with those persons af-
filiated with the University, who have given up on
the football team and the coaching staff’ after the

first game.

Evidently, it would be futile
for me to enumerate on the fact
that sophomores need more than
one game to jell, that the final
score of the UCLA game was
not indicative of the strength of

' either team, etc. I will leave
that to the sports writers.

I AM (however,) disgusted.

even ashamed, of those students ‘

who have given up on Coach
Dave Hart; of those students

who have already written off the 1968 season as an
instant replay of the past two years. WHY?

V Because I know damn well that those same fair-
weather fans will be the ones to brag and boast
and wallow in the glory of the remainder of this

season’s victories.

Sure, all of us lost our pride Saturday night.

‘i.Serious  Stuff

by JOE ANDERSON
It was a toss up a few nights

_.to review: The Fugs —— It Crawal-
-‘ed into My Hand, Honest (RS)
"or Ravi Shanker- Chappaqua (OS
3230). Both are excellent records
.-but due solely to the state of my
‘ﬂmind at that time I decided on
the Fugs. At a time when futility
-‘and indicision pervade the poli-
tically minded individual the Fugs
(appear with a delightful respite.

It Crawaled Into My Hand,
Honest is the latest collection of
’_ dross from the Fug’s cloacal vat_
of genius. It is the most imagina-
tive (and funniest) album they
have produced to date. It is also
the final step in the Mothers of
;,=Invention — Fugs assimilation.
"There are now two groups which
.,successfu1ly define the new con-
“sciousness while tromping through
-A'merican’s Political — Social
;‘.Miasma.
I ' The first song, Crystal Liaison,
opens with the pageantry of a full
force brass section seemingly an-
nouncing great things to come.
From here it lapses into Ed San-

ders’ cryptic verbal profundities

which become all the more inscrut-
able by an echo effect. Exactly
what is happening is just about
impossible to relate without be-
coming unintelligible. A rather
concise translation might be: “on-
',ward worldlyites, the supernal
scum of the inexorable reality is
‘festering on your tongue.”’

 The next song is a comical
ithremody entitled Rames II is
Dead, My Love. As a country and
western arrangement, Rames II

I features the talented Ed Sanders
yodeling. The song delineates the

departure of Rames II from‘

‘Memphis to heaven, a noteworthy
event in itself.

“Rames the second is dead my
love

he’s wandering the plains
where the Blessed live

Ptah and Ra and Sokaris too

are taking him on the Celestial
Boat.” '

Reminiscences of J. Strauss’
Blue Danube Waltz are to be
_found in the Fugs original Bruial
Waltz but a more interesting and
timely piece is Wide, Wide Riv-
-er, featuring the nefarious Ken
Weaver lamenting this “great

~ b big brown river.” A political and
social comment upon the pre-

, sent situation “Wide, Wide River”

The Fugs Commen
The Political S cene

ago as to which of two records ’

“s..— “”

. c g gt".”.*rnE pm NEWS’-—Wed_nesday, September 25, 1968  

questions the value of an elective

process “supposedly democratic

. . where you end up always
voting for the lesser of two evils.”
Ugh, the river’s getting higher.

Due to certain absurd journalis-
tic conventions, the title .of the
first song on the second side is
unprintible (but not unthinkable).
The main character is Johnny P.
0. “With a violent heart.’_’ Johnny’s
favorite pastimes are drinking,
punching out fags, stomping on
peace creeps and commies and
pulling legs off frogs. He swears
that no legislator is going to take
away his guns.

But the one fear Johnny does
have is that of the Red Angel.
“When the Red Angel comes . . .
do you think that you’re going to
go toheaven./with a violent
heart?” The next song is Mari-
juana, a really fine rendition in
the style _of a Gregorian chant
which simply enuciates the vari-

‘ ous colloquial and technical terms

associated with marijuana.

Among Tuli Kupferberg’s many
contributions is When the Mode
of the Music Changes, a rather
complicated piece with shifting
tempos and disjunct melodies.
When the Mode of the Music
Changes is a pithy collection of
Kupferberg aphorisms. Some of
which are:

“He who does not dance neith-
er shall he eat.”

“You can have the men who
make the laws, give me the mu-
sic makers.”

“Beware a man who is not mov-
ed by sound.”

“Music hath alarums to wild
the civil breast.” ‘

There are many more selections
which are basically self-explana-
tory such as: Whimpers from the
Jello, Tuli Visited by the Ghost
of Plontinus, Grope Need and The
National Haiku Contest.

The thrill of the Fugs lies in
their ability to be both funny and
yet deadly serious. One can laugh
for just so long at their songs be-
fore one is disposed to think.

The Fugs explore and use ev-
ery aspect that today’s Rock me-
dium affords, and they do so with
a high degree of competence and
command. Music can shake the
walls of a nation, and if any na-
tion needs a little shaking, it’s
ours.

Advisors
  Ready
To Aid  

by ALAN E. BARR

Each year many freshmen
enter school with set career
goals, only to later discover
that they cannot achieve these
ends.

“One of my most important
concerns,” pointed out ‘Dr.
James Kehl, Dean at the School
of Arts and Sciences, “is how
to handle these students who
find. that they won’t make it.”

About eighteen per cent of in-
coming freshman set their goal
on becoming doctors. “Unfor-
tunately, many students do this

because of their parents’ in-
fluence,” stated Dr. Kehl. Af-
ter a term or two, many of these
studentssfind they cannot hand-
le the work load. “How a stu-
den't handles this problem is
not only his problem, but the pro-
blem of the Advising Center,”
said Dr. Kehl.

The Advising Center is
more than just a place to re-
gister for next term’s classes.
“Many students are at a to-
tal loss as to what to do when
they find themselves "unable
to succeed in a specified de-
partment,” indicated Dr. Kehl.
“If a student finds ‘that he will
not be successful in an area,
often his or her advisor can
point out a direction in a re-
lated field. This is one of the
jobs of the advisors and stu-
dents should not hesitate to
come talk to them. Sometimes,
a new major or a transfer to a
new college is the only answer.

At the University of Pitts- _

burgh, or any other school,
there are many programs "avail-
able that most freshman are not
even familiar with. “We sug-
gest that if a student finds a
subject interesting which is
not his intended major he
try a few more courses in the
subject just to familiarize him-
self with other programs.”
cluded Dr. Kehl.

COH-

participated as leaders’ in the
informal mass.

The Oratory Club, a Catho-
lic ortanization based on a
community of peace with mem-
bers working for the same re-
ligious goals, is a Catholic stu-
dent organization on the cam-
pus of the University and Car-
negie—Mel1on.

Last year the Oratory Club
decided to experiment with a
relatively new form of the
mass, the Hootenanny Mass or
Folk Mass. The mass, “origin-
ally intended to be a commun-
ity- _ celebration and .. worship,”
according to Father Kennedy,
“had become too out-dated for
contemporary relevance. ”

The use of popular liturgies,
forms for public worship, be-
gan in the hopes of involving
more students in the mass it-
self. The experiment included

the use of contemporary folk .

music and instruments as mod-

 ern vehicles of the mass.

Two types of contemporary

» musical masses are employed:

the “Father Clarence Rivers
,Mass,” and the “Missa Bossa
Nova.” Last year Father Ken-
nedy and members o_f the Ora-
tory adapted the “Father Clar-
ence Rivers Mass,” which has
lilting melody and the tone of
a Negro Spiritual. This year
they are trying the “Missa
-Bossa Nova,” which has a sny—
copated rhythm and a driving
beat. The instruments used are
the guitar, the bongo, and an
African instrument which pro-
vides a scraping ‘sound. The
music committee of the Ora-
tory Club plans to continue
with this form, as “the parish
seems to be responding well
to it.” * -

In the Folk Mass the parish
participates in the singing of
both hymns and songs which
are a part of the proper of the
mass, parts which stay the
same from week to week, such
as‘ the Introit, Kyrie, Sanctus,
Communion, etc. However, it
is the popular version of the
songs that is being employed.
Joan Ba_ez’s version of the
Lord’s Prayer, is now a regu-
lar part of the mass.

Leo Del Pasqua, an under-
graduate at the University and
a member of the Oratory Club,
wrote the words to two songs
which are sung in the Folk
Mass, One and Spirit of God.
Mr. Del Pasqua and Mary
Bartlett supervise the selection
of hymns. Frequently used
hymns are the following: Pe-
ter, Paul and Mary's Because
All Men Are Brothers, Pete
Seger’s version of Turn, Turn,
Turn, for which the words
come from the Ecclesiastes
Book of the Bible, and two
hymns from Hymns for Young

Christians, ‘ “Of My Hands”
and “Take Our Bread.” A
Father Kennedy cites t h e

purpose of the religious experi-
ment with the mass as an at-
tempt to make the mass cul-
turally more significant.

The elimination of an altar
boy is another important
change in the presentation of
the mass. At the Folk Mass
students from the parish carry
the bread and wine to the al-
tar from the back of the parish
in what islcalled an offetory
procession, as a ymbol of the
life and work of the offering
community. Father Kennedy
feels that this actual student
participation makes the mass
more meaningful to them.

Another obvious difference

in the Folk Mass and a regu-

lar mass is the casualness of
the attire and conducts. Girls
do not wear a. veil or has as
they traditionally have done,
as the symbolism is not longer
pertinent, explains Father Ken-
nedy. The general attitude and

conduct of the entire parish is

more relaxed and far less for-
mat then it is in the more tra-
ditional mass.

The change of place of the
mass from Heinz Chapel to the
Common Facilities Auditori-
um occurred for two reasons:
One, the Folk Mass did not
fit in the e_nvironment. Two,
the University Music Depart-
ment» controls the type of mu-
sic to be used in Heinz Chap-
el, and the music of the Folk

Mass is still to experimental

to be accepted.

“The purpose of our open let-

“All too long we have had no

‘. . . Some key administrators
do not want to listen; they seem
uninterested in confronting the
problems we bring up. Perhaps
they have good intentions but
they indicate their contentment
with the structure that now ex-
ists.

“This is a structure that has
proven to be incapable of solving
theproblems now confronting the
University. The administration is
unwilling to consider any of our
proposals. This became all too
clear to us in a meeting with
three representatives of the ad-
ministration on Sept. 20. They re-
fuse to do anything that will en-
danger their position of total and
all encompassing power. The pro-
per channels have thus been ex-
hausted.

“Thusly we state that the time
has come for faculty and students

to join this movement. It is time
that students stop responding like
children to those who treat us like
children: it is time we asserted
our rights of equal participation
in decision making processes of

T the University.

“A position of equal participa-
tion of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration must replace the an-
tiquated ‘in loco parentis’ posi-
tion which the University now
follows. It is the faculty and stu-
dents with the help of those in ad-
ministrative positions who should
run this Universitv.

“We hope all students and fac-
ulty members interested in bring-
ing about a change in the aca-
demic and social regulations of
the University will get in touch
with one of us.”

Fraternity softball finally
got underway last Thursday
and Friday with full slates of

games. Earlier delays were
caused by weather and rush week.

In the Fraternity A league two
favorites and two underdogs won
season inaugurals in games that
ranged from slug fests to pitch-
ers’ duels. Sigma Alpha Mu. Phi
Kappa Theta, Delta Sigma Phi.
and defending champion Pi Lamb-
da Phi all won their openers.

Sigma Alpha Mu edged Sigma
Chi, 18-15." The Sammies put nine
runs across in the second inning.
but actually had to come from be-
hind to make pitcher Dave Shear
a winner a f t e r trailing 13 - 0.
Shear, as well as Jay Kaplan and
Randy Bergman, added three hits
while centerfielder Willie Baxt
scored the winning run. Barry Lo-
pez led Sig Chi’s attack with three
doubles.

Bill Webber’s hurling paced Phi
Kappa Theta to a 5-3 upset of Phi
Epsilon Pi. Tim Leister rapped a
two-run single in the sixth to pro-'
vide the deciding runs. Phi Ep led
3-0 going into th e fourth, b ut
RBI’s by Pat Bienconi and Jerry
Fair tied the game.

In another squeaker, coach and
professional baseball p l a y e r
Geroge McKenzie guided Delta
Sigma ‘Phi to a. 4-2 win over Zeta
Beta Tau. Jeff Heimberg doubled
with the bases loaded inthe first
to give ZBT an early lead, but
Brian Provan countered with two
RBI’s in the fourth to make a win-
ner of Delta Sig’s Buzz Krwonak.

Finally, Pi Lambda Phi made
easy work of Delta Tau Delta,
winning 10-3. Home runs by Tom
Ginsberg and John Kates were
among the 19 hit Pi Lam attack.
The Lemmels also committed no
erros behind pitcher Steve Rosen-
baum as they opened defense of
their A league title.

The B league results also show
several mismatched games. How-
ever, with a win Monday over
Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon (2-0) has opened an early
lead in an effort to unseat defend-
ing champion Kappa Sigma. Kap-
pa Sig lost its opening game to
the PiKa’s and must come up
through the losers’ bracket to win
the title.

and this is
our apartment

Anyway, this is part of our living room-
the bedroom and dinette look just as sharp.
How can a couple of college guys like us
afford all this loaded luxury stuff, you ask?
Nope—we’re no Rockefeller kith or kin—just
typical students, nursing our ﬁnances along.

   

     

VVhen we first rented this place we
ﬁgured to scrounge some furniture from the
folks, maybe get a piece or two from a second-
hand store and fill in with a couple of orange
crates.

Then we read in the newspapers that
Sheffield rents furniture!

Know what we found out in a huny?

We found we could rent three whole rooms  .

of beautiful furniture  no strain! My
buddy, Jeff, and I split the tab——$12.50 apiece
a month, to be exact—and we have a place to
bug our friends eyes out!

Sure . . . you can do it, too . . . whether
you're students, or anybody! [lust check in
with Sheffield Furniture Renta at 1200 Cha-
teau St. and pick out the furniture you like.
It’ll come to maybe $25 to $30 a month in all!
Live in the lap of luxury like we do without it
knocking the old wallet for a loop!

P. S. if you want, they can also rent you a TV . . . a
rug . . . a-portable bar with stools . . . extra lamps, chairs,
pictures, paintings . . . almost anything you need with
room furniture rental. ' ’ I

New Dish Created For University;
Eggs a la Pitt To Aid Hunger Fight

by MARC SIMON

In the history of the culinary
arts. there has probably never
been a creation that can quite
compare to the masterpiece I
have concocted. Eggs ‘a la Pitt.
This special preparation of the
common henfruit is especially de-
signed to please the discerning

taste of the University’ student
and after I have given the recipe.
I urge all who have read it to de-

_mand that it be served in the

Tuck Shop and the Towers Cafe-
teria.

The preliminary step in the
creation of Eggs ‘a la Pitt is to

gather all the ingredients. Prob-
ably the most important one in
this egg creation is the egg. We
also need a hamburger, well
done. from the Sardi’s of Oak-
land. Winky’s. a vanilla milk-
shake from the Original. and
some exotic spices (such as salt
and pepper). After assembling all
these extravagant ingredients we
are ready to start the crucial steps
of blending and mixing.

TAKING A LARGE mixing
bowl, we separate the eggs and
beat them for exactly two and
two-thirds minutes. If the beat-
ing process is much longer. the
Eggs ‘a la Pitt will have that
“worn-out” taste; if much less.
the final product will look like a
runny hamburger iceball. While
beating the eggs we gently fold
in the vanilla milkshake. This

will give the final product that ’

“continental" flavor. the conti-
nent being Antarctica if the milk-
shake is cold enough.

Next we take the Winkyburger
(already cooked to save us time)
and grind it up. One can use his
hands to grind it. thus giving our

dish a down—home earthy flavor, .

especially if one’s hands are dir-
ty. Then we blend the mushed-
up hamburger with our egg-milk-
shake mixture until the mixture
has the consistency of molten
lava.

USING OUR salt and pepper
liberally (this is‘ a democratic
university), we season. season.
season to our heart’s (and per-
haps, heartburn’s) content. Then
we pop it into an oven preheated
to exactly 387.62 degrees centi-
grade and bake for a week. or 40.-
000 miles. whichever comes first.
or whatever. and presto — Eggs
‘a la Pitt!

P.S.: Do not attempt to create
this dish unless you possess a
strong stomach or have eaten caf-
eteria food extensively.
