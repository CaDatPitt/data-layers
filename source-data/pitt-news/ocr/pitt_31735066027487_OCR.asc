SGBicreates new mall shuttle

Rebecca N. Jones
  :i:‘v"’  "

 

It’s a rainy Saturday aftemoon, the day
after payday. The kitchen has been cleaned,
your clothes are washed, and now you are
sitting in your room wishing for something
to do.

No matter what ideas you may have,
theic’s still one problem: no way to get there.

Some people’s weekend wishes will
soon be granted. Beginning Feb. 22, a new
Pitt shuttle will whisk students to and from
local shopping malls on weekends.

Student Government Board member
Marquette Bowman and the parking and
transportation depaitrnent are the genies
responsible for the idea

Bowman said the plan for a shuttle trav-
elling to either Century III Mall or Ross Park
Mallhasbeenintheworkssincethebegin—
ning of this term.

“I know some students expressed an
interest in having [shuttles to the mall]. From
there, the idea went to Parking and
Transportation, and it was decided that the
University could, in fact, do it,” said
Bowman.

Bowman said the buses will travel on a
rotating schedule. Each week, the shuttles
will switch between Century III and Ross
Park Malls.

If enough students show an interest in
having another bus rim to Momoeville Mall,
the shuttle may eventually be re-routed, or
another route could be added.

“The mall shuttles are a good idea,” said
Bob Harkins, director of parking and trans-

 

portation. “Bowman brought the idea to me,
and we played with it. We decided we were
willing to work with it. Students will now
have the fieedorn to go out and go shopping
in other areas besides Oakland. Really, it’s a
win—win situation on both ends of the p .”

Students wanted the shuttle because of
convenience and safety concerns, according
to Bowman. ‘

“The PAT buses are not convenient You
may have to stand late at night at a bus stop,
waiting for the bus in the cold. And then
there are the long, long rides it takes to even
get to Monroeville,” he said

The ﬁrst weekend of shuttle runs will
determine how many buses are used and for
how long the service will be available. There
will only be one, 48-passenger bus operat-
ing; however, that number may rise if the
trial runs are successful.

“We are hoping for a lot of students to
use this. We need ridership and would like to
seeridershipatamaximuminordertocon—
tinue,” said Bowman. “I would like to see a
few shuttle runs during the summer and def-
initely next year.”

The trips will be ﬁee for Pitt students,
and the buses will be ﬁmded by the student
activities fee, the parking and transportation
fee, and the SGB.

The shuttles will leave the Union at 12,
2, 4, and 6 p.rri., and are tentatively set to
leavethemallsat 1, 3, and5 pm. So far, nei-
ther Harkins or Bowman are certain whether

Student activists get second
chance at $2 K for conference trip

Unless the Student Governirient Board decides to provide
extra ﬁmding for more delegates to attend, Pitt students may be
few in number at a legislative conference for educational access in
Washington, D.C. this April.

The United States Student Association is a national group that
ﬁghts for the rights of students in universities across the coinitry. It
isthelargestaridoldest studentassociaiion, andmenibersﬁomdif-
ferent delegations around the country come together in the District
of Columbia to lobby for access to higher education programs.

The Student Govermnent Board voted last Wednesday to
deny an extra $2,000 for the Governmental Relations Committee
to send ﬁve more students to the USSA conference this April.

At the end of its life, a prehistoric

Days of rain ell, push-

Pitt graduate Vince Santucci is the
man the federal government has chosen
to stop them.

Santucci, who studied geology and

graduate and grad student, is a real—life
“Indiana Jones,” the nation’s only pistol-

“I ﬁnished my graduate work in ‘91
and started work in the National Park
Service, and I was recruited by the FBI to
assist in a multi-agency investigation into
fossil theft,” Santucci said. “Because so

take fossils from national parks, and

many important fossils are found there,

salamander fossil found

Around the World

MOSCOW — Boris Yeltsin made
his first radio speech since becoming
ill in early January on Saturday. At
the same time, a bid to demand the
Russian president’s resignation in

‘ the parliament failed. Even though

they couldn’t garner enough support
for his ‘ouster, lawmakers did adopt a
resolution requiring the government
to provide a detailed assessment of
Yeltsin’s health. They also started to
talk about laws that would govern
the transfer of power should Yeltsin
step down.

Meanwhile, Yeltsin sounded very
smooth in his speech, but lacked the
energy that won him re—election in
the first place. In the speech, he
made no mention of his health prob-
lems or the fact that people are ask-
ing him to step down. Instead, he
spoke of improving Russian relations
with Chechnya and talked about pro-
tecting pensions for elderly
Russians. Associated Press

SYDNEY, Australia — Several
weeks ago, an Australian farmer
found the fossil of a salamander.
Saturday, a group of Australian sci-
entists said that it is one of the most
important Australian findings this
century and disclosed that, according
to their findings, it is 220 million

I years old. The fossilized salamander,

almost six feet long, is an amphibian
related to today’s frogs and salaman-
ders, but it existed before dinosaurs.

FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — A Fort
Bragg paratrooper joked about hav-
ing earned a skinhead spiderweb tat-
too for killing a black person. Fellow
paratrooper James Burmeister said,
“Maybe I’ll earn my Spiderweb
tonight,” shortly before taking part
in the murder of two black men,
according to testimony from eyewit-
ness Randy Meadows. After a night
of beer drinking, Burmeister left the
car where he made this statement,
apparently hunting for blacks. If
found guilty, Burmeister could face

the death penalty for killing Jackie .

USSA

After SGB President Justin DalMolin
broke a 44 tie vote to overrule the Allocation
Cornrrrittee’s refusal to provide the funding,
the board voted to investigate the request
more extensively.

SGB are currently sending ﬁve repre-
sentatives to the conference at a combined
cost of about $1500, according to Allocations
Chair Noelle Campagna

“The reason that we are pushing for this
is because we need a delegation to this con-
ference that is representative of our campus,”
said Governmental Relations Comrrrittee
board member Aisha Anderson.

The USSA is divided into over 15 dif-
ferent caucuses to address student needs,
such as the People of African Descent
Coalition and the National Women’s Student
Coalition, of which Anderson is co—chair.

“The United States Student Association
is for educational access,” Anderson said. “It
deals with certain issues and differences that
would prevent this access to students for
ﬁnancial or ethnical or other reasons. We
need to send a diverse group of students that
will address our needs on this campus.”

There are ﬁve spots that already have
funding for the trip in April. Three of the ﬁve
are reserved for the three Govemmental
Relations Committee board members:
Anderson, Adam Neary, and Keith
Campbell. The fourth will probably go to the
head of the Federal Relations section of the
GRC. That leaves one spot to ﬁll.

‘The purpose of USSA is for students to
unite and ﬁght together to address the issues
that affect us,” Anderson said. “I don’t think
that sending only ﬁve students will effective-
ly accomplish that”

Neary said the Legislative Conference in
Washington, D.C in April will help bring
together students from all over the country to
share their ideas and their concerns about
their schools.

“I am in favor of a large delegation ﬁorn
Pitt because the students get to attend differ-
ent meetings and interact with other stu-
dents,” he said. “Delegates from other uni-
versities get to hear and learn from what we
have to say, and we get the same beneﬁt ﬁonr
them.”

 

Neary also said that USSA provides stu-
dents with a constant contact with
Washington, D.C. During the April confer-
ence, delegates from Pemrsylvania will be
honored with presenting one of two
Legislator of the Year awards to Sen. Arlen
Specter.

“As one of Pennsylvania’s only delega-
tions, the students from Pitt will get to have
one-on—one contact with Sen. Specter,”
Neary said.

The Governmental Relations
Conrrnittee’s request was ﬁrst denied by the
Allocations Committee two weeks ago, and
SGB voted to send the request back to
Allocations for further consideration.
Allocations denied the request, and the board
itself will now revise the request.

DalMolin said he wants more students
to attend the conference in April so Pitt is as
well represented as possible.

“The main thing that I am concerned
with is that the delegation needs to address
our concerns here at Pitt,” he said. “We need
to let USSA know where we stand, whether
we agree or disagree on issues with them.”

DalMolin said the split vote on the issue
by the board is a signal that this is something
requiring further investigation.

“Ifthe board is split, their the request def-
initely needs to be revised,” he said. “Also, a
lot of students voiced their concenrs about the
issue two weeks ago at-the meeting where
Allocations ﬁrst denied the request. As
Student Government Board president, it’s
my job to listen to those voices.”

DalMolin said he thinks the information
and knowledge gained by the students at the
conference will help those individuals and
the university as a whole.

Anyone who is interested in attending
the conference may apply. Neary said that the
interview and application process will be
announced soon, pending the ﬁnal revision
of the request by the Student Government
Board.

The board will armounce its decision on
how many more students they will supply
ﬁmds for at their regular weekly meeting on
Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. in room 637 of the
Wrlliarn Pitt Union.

Some dealers say the government
doesn’t protect America’s fossil riches and
that commercial dealers actually protect the
specimens ﬁonr the elements by taking
them from their natural environment.

“The skeletons are harder than the sed-
imentary rock around them because tlrey’re
crystalized, but it’s true —— they can still
erode away,” Santucci said. “In a way, the
dealers are protecting the fossils, but tlrey’re
destroying their research value by not let-
ting scientists do it.”

Theft, tax fraud, customs violations,
and a host of other crimes united agents
from the FBI, the IRS, Customs, and the
National Park Service to hunt down fossil
dealers with Santucci.

“They had to hide their income and

smuggle these fossils out of the country
because taking the fossils is such an illegal
activity,” he said.

Their efforts resulted in a raid on the
world’s largest commercial fossil dealer and
the recovery of a perfectly preserved
Tyrarmosaurus Rex skeleton nicknamed
“Sue.”

Sue’s worth is estimated at around $5
rrrillion, but Santucci said that price can go
as far as $12 million at an auction.

“People in labs and doing research for
museums can’t afford to pay that cost,”
Santucci said. “These precious fossils end
up in the hands of a private collector, away

ﬁorn the public where they really belong. I

These remains were taken from public land.

They belong to everyone.”

As part of a team of FBI agents,
Santucci raided the Black Hills Institute of
Geological Research in South Dakota in
1993, uncovering not only Sue, but a moun-
tain of evidence implicating the institute and
its director, Peter Larson, in nationwide fos-
sil theft from national parks.

They also discovered that leaks within
the Department of the Interior were provid-
ing Larson with information about Santucci
and his colleagues.

“[Larson] knew I opposed what he was
doing and was working with the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology to develop stronger
fossil protection legislation,” Santucci said.
“He was trying to get evidence to discredit
us, discredit that movement, and destroy our
investigation of his business.”

Santucci could not comment further,
saying only that these discoveries have
sparked new investigations of government
workers involved with the Black Hills
Institute.

The controversial raid brought wide-
spread public attention to the dangers of
“fossil rustlers.” A Feb. 25 “NOVA” docu-
mentary about the Black Hills case featur-
ing interviews with Santucci and other
members of his team has also brought atten-
tion back to the case.

Larson maintains his innocence, but
was convicted of multiple felony and mis-
demeanor charges ranging from from fraud
to customs violations and government theft.
Currently in a federal prison in Colorado, he
is appealing the convictions.

But the case is shrouded in still more
controversy. Larson discovered the
Tyrannosaurus on a ranch on a Sioux Indian
Reservation in South Dakota. He says his
hunt was legal because he provided the
rancher with $5000 to search the land.

Santucci said that complicates the rnat—
ter, but it is still government theft.

“Because it’s an Indian reservation,
both a federal permit and tribal permit were
necessary for Peter Larson to legally collect
that specimen. The rancher’s permission
wasn’t enough. It was reservation land and
belonged to all Native Americans,”
Santucci said. “He knew he needed these
things but also knew he would be refused.
Peter Larson knowingly broke the law.’’

After complaints from the rancher and
members of the Sioux tribe the local US
attorney ordered the dinosaur conﬁscated.

Today, Sue is in government storage
and is technically still owned by the ranch-
er. Santucci said he’s heard rumors that
Sotheby’s auction house will try to sell it in
April.

This case may aid in the completion of
Santucci’s mission for stricter fossil hunting
regulations, serving as an example of the
damage commercial dealers can do to sci-
entiﬁc research, even when it’s performed
on private lands.

Some have attacked the investigation
as an invasion by the government, but
Santucci maintains new legislation will ben-
eﬁt Americans through the research it pro-
vides.

said. “But in places like the Petriﬁed Forest

He said amateurs can assist researchers
by digging out fossils on designated sites
rather than doing it on their own.

“That’s a positive way of maintaining a
hobby — learning on your own and assist-
ing scientists in the process,” he said.

Many of the reasons for Santucci’s cru-
sade are personal, he says.

“For young  dinosaurs are the eas-
iest way to get them interested in science,”
he said. “We need to make sure our most
important discoveries are not lost because of
one person’s greed. We may lose more than

just valuable data. We may lose the inspira-
tion for a new generation of scientists.”

Currently on hiatus from his work as a
ranger at Petriﬁed Forest National Park,
Santucci is delivering lectures at Carnegie
Museum about national parks.

Because Pittsburgh’s Carnegie
Museum boasts one of the most important
dinosaur exhibits in the world, Santucci
hopes his hometown inﬂuence will raise
interest in science from grade schools to
universities.

“I remember sitting in professor Harold
Rawlin’s paleontology class here at Pitt, and
I never dreamed my life would be changed
by science in such a positive way,” Santucci
said. “I only hope discoveries that might
make powerful changes in other people’s
lives aren’t lost. That’s why I do what I do.”

[ilil] VIEWS

 

SGB should worry
about Piﬂ not D. C.

SGB President Justin DalMolin was the deciding
vote in the Student Government Board’s decision to
overrule the Allocations Committee’s refusal to provide
the funding to send more than five members of the
Governmental Relations Committee to Washington, D.C.
for the United States Student Association conference in
April.

The board is planning to investigate the request to
determine whether or not more students need to be sent.

What interests are actually being addressed at the
USSA conference? If it is just a conference where a
bunch of students get together to talk about ways to
lobby for student aid, then five are plenty. If this is a lob-
bying effort, once again, five are plenty.

As in the campaign, when such national issues as
abortion were discussed, Student Government Board is
trying to play national politics rather than deal with the
tasks that need to be accomplished right here on campus.
Student needs at Pitt need to be solved by working with
the administration here, not in D.C. The major function
of SGB is to lobby for student interests on campus, not
to spend student money for trips to D.C.

Also, why is it that four of the five positions for the
trip have already been claimed by people affiliated with
SGB? The last position is supposedly up for grabs, but
there has been no search or advertisement for people to
apply for the trip. According to Adam Neary, a member
of the Governmental Relations Committee, the applica-
tion process will start soon. Shouldn’t they be soliciting
students to apply? Once applications are accepted, who
will be reviewing them and under what criteria? Will the
group going be representative of the student body at Pitt?

The first place students and the SGB need to go is the
Board of Trustees meeting on Feb. 20. If we can’t make
the people in our own backyard listen, we’ll never get
the folks up on Capitol Hill to listen, either.

to get it done.

Besides, she’d be too busy making the coifee to

hired a danre to be the chief fund—raiser, for crying out
loud.

But things’ve gotten a bit outta hand.

After all, there are, by my count, seven out of 42
lady trustees, andithree of 30 emeritus trustees. This
seems, to me, a bit excessive. Of four vice chancellors,
one’s a babe. There’re 12 deans at Pitt, and two of
them’re women. And let’s not forget that only one of
seven vice presidents at UPMC is a chick. ‘

Now I’m sure that all’a these girls are “qualiﬁed,”
but really — a few more, and the men’re gomra start
to feel out of place.

Speaking as a member of the fairer sex, men don’t
deal well with women in positions of authority over
them — whether these men work for us or not. The
other day, a male student leader came to our oﬂice to
complain and was so disappointed to learn that he
needed to be talking to me about his problem that he
called several times to try to speak with my male boss.
When he still ended up talking to me, he included in
our little chat a man who works beneath me, because,
after all, how could he be certain he’d get any results
if he only talked to a chick?!

It took me a while to realize, of course, that he was
rightinwhathedid. Icertainly didn’tcatertohimlike
I should have. My mama’d be mortiﬁed if she heard
how I treated him. She done raised me right, after all.

I was a bit upset still, and I was talking with a
male ﬁiend, who’ll tell any dame who asks that he’s
not intimidated by intelligent women, about the situa-

let's not have chicks making the decisions i

tion. He set me straight. I was just taking it too per-
sonally, thinking this “leader” was intentionally slight-
ing me and trying to sidestep me. Some men, my
friend said, just need to work things out with other
men.

You girls don’t understand, he told me.

“This student leader greets me with a hug rather
than a handshake, and I ’m the one taking things too
personally?” I asked.

There are 5,163 undergraduate skirts in the
College of Arts and Sciences alone, compared to
4,330 men. Throw in the grad students, and the num-
bers swell to 5,958 gals and 5,273 men. There’s one
maleFAS dean,andhe’sgotthreeassociatedeans—
one’s even a babe. Eleven of the '50 departments and
programs in the school’re chaired by those ofus in
heels. .

Maybe those numbers are just a little out of pro-
portion with the student body. After all, since half of
the little ladies’re only here to catch a husband, some
of the lady administrators should step down.

And those seven shapely trustees should be at
home raising their broods.

Now, the lady deans’re in information science
and nursing, deﬁnitely well placed. Information sci-
ence has 347 delightful damsels and 348 burly boys, if
we combine grads and undergrads. I’m sure that all the
chicks’ll make ﬁne librarians, and the men’ll be handy
with the computers and technology.

What I really wanna know is why there are men
in nursing at all. If we’re not allowed to tread on their
ground, why are they trying to push in on ours? That’s
right, 124 men in the nursing program and 742 angels.
I’m sure that when these men have to change some
bedpans or give a sponge bath, they’ll realize that
chasing the skirts in college wasn’t such a hot idea

Maybe Chancellor Nordenberg should take steps
to correct this problem. When he’s hiring permanent
replacements for all the interim administrators, he
should look for people to ﬁt in with the broad—shoul-
dered, square-jawed staff he already has. Maybe
instead of eliminating faculty, staff, and students from
the Board of Trustees, J .W. Connolly should think
about cutting the board’s ridiculous size by purging it
of the distracting, lipstick-wearing skirts that keep any
progress from being made.

After all, y’all know who does the real work in
this world.

Cesca Antonelli Is‘ gonna punch the next student leader
who thinks he can get away with hugging hex

The Constitution of the Unchallenged Service of Marriott

 

We, a food serving body of the
University of Pittsburgh, in order to form a
more imperfect William Pitt Union, establish
jaundice, ensure salmonella, provide for
common botulisrrr, promote our employees
turning to Welfare, and secure the Blessings
of Monopoly to the students of Pitt, do
ordain and establish this Constitution for the
Unchallenged Service of Marriott.
ARTICLE 1

Section 1. The House of Marriott shall be

composed of the Members randomly chosen
for their rude treatment of human beings.
No person shall be a Representative in
the House of Marriott who shall have the
ability to serve a portion of food that could
satisfy the hunger of a common cockroach.
Likewise, they must not possess the ability to
work at any speed that would match or
exceed that of the yearly growth rate of Mt.
Everest.
Section 2. Personnel must be able to warp
and destroy any student ID in scanners with-
in no more than three (3) swipes. They must
also be capable of staring vacantly at the reg-

ister while building backup lines 40 to 50’

students long.

Section 3. Persons in the House must be pro-
ﬁcient in communicating with students
through a series of grunts, obscene gestures,

and foul language.

Any personnel determined to be
“friendly” or “happy” shall either be placed
on janitorial duty or ﬁred immediately. If a
worker still refuses to become miserable, he
will be reminded of the employees who
“accidently” got Legionnaires’ disease.
Section 4. The food service of Marriott shall
have the right to use any fonn or combina-
tion of fomrs of currency, including the
Choice Dollars, Dining Dollars, Campus
Funds, Blocks, Food Poison Funds,
Penicillin Pennies, Diarrhea Dollars, and $5
bills ﬁom the Monopoly anniversary edition.

Any food—purchasing system that is
understood by anyone not an attorney gener-
al or professor in Pitt’s School of Law will be
immediately removed and replaced. 0

ARTICLE 2

Section 1. All powers shall be granted to
those who are so far removed from the stu-
dent body and so ﬁscally secure that they
shall have “no clue” as to the situation of stu-
dents attending Pitt’s main carrrpus. The gov-
ernment shall be divided into three govem—
ing bodies: the House of Marriott, the
Supreme Food Court, and the grand food
czar.

Section 2. The grand food czar must be a
United States citizen over the age of 20 and
shall have worked in food service for at least
23 seconds. Likewise, the czar must be capa-
ble of being deaf, blind, and, most irnpor—

tantly, dumb whenever possible.

The czar shall be assisted by several
aides—de—crarnps spread out in several oﬂices
and will be solely responsible for seeing to it
that nothing is accomplished.

Section 3. The czar shall be assisted by an
undersecretary in charge of usery. The czar
may declare war for no apparent reason by
ordering the undersecretary to gather “his
boys” to remove threats.

ARTICLE 3

Section 1. The House of Marriott shall
appoint a board of nine members to the
Supreme Food Court. The Supreme Food
Court shall be responsible for investigation
of student food complaints. They will con-
vene every 90th year of every third century,
beginning in 2222.

Section 2. The House of Marriott shall not
enact any law granting the voicing of griev-
ances by its customers.

This clause ensures that the Student
Government food service committee of the
University of Pittsburgh shall be regarded, at
best, as co-vice—sub-assistant—undersecretary
to the chancellor of undergraduate colfee
grinding and ﬁlter changing.

If a task force threatens this ineplness,
the undersecretary to the food czar in charge
of usury shall call upon his minions to neu-
tralize the threat.

ARTICLE 5

Section 1. The House of Marriott shall not
promote non—hurnans to the rank of supervi-

our facilities more often than health inspec-
tors, they are not to be regarded as “friends”
or confused with “managers.” They are sim-

Section 2. To avoid eliminating its members
through disease, depleting its ftmds, or
weakening our ranks, the House of Marriott
shall appoint a cheaper, healthier caterer for
its own events.

*>I<*

I strongly suggest that we act quickly on

this proposed constitution. We have already -

effectively severed any ties to the Marriott
corporation, and now is the time. If we do
not enact this constitution, I am sure that we
are doomed to continue in our current state
of chaos.

Marc Nuzzo wants Marriott to know they
shouldn ’t dish it out if they wouldn ’t feed it to
their dog.

SPORTS

Baseball and
Belle are meant
for each other

 

I’m not a naturally sadistic person. I
generally don’t enjoy seeing others suffer,
but the latest allegations of gambling by
Chicago White Sox slugger Albert Belle
could turn out to be wonderful. The ironic
part is that major league baseball’s screwy
system of “justice” may actually turn out to
be responsible for something beneﬁcial to
baseball for a change.

Belle has admitted to losing $40,000
gambling on football and basketball games.
This, from a man who just signed a contract
worth $11 million per season for the next
ﬁve years. That’s like Joe Average blowing a
few hundred bucks in assorted oﬁice pools.
Thousands of people do it, and it doesn’t kill
them. Belle claims he hasn’t bet on any base-
ball games, so there are no immediate viola-
tions of any major league baseball rules.

Of course, Pete Rose claimed he never
bet on baseball, either, and he still got banned
from baseball for life. That was back when
baseball had a commissioner, whose job was
to maintain some kind of order and act in the
best interests of the game, as opposed to
whatever “acting commissioner for life”
Bud Selig is doing now.

This whole situation has a twofold
irony. First, Belle appears to have done noth-
ing wrong, which is a departure from the
norm. Second, it looks like the baseball lords
are going to punish someone, which is also
unusual. As it stands now, Belle is looking at
one year of probation, though nothing is oﬂi-
cial yet.

A year of probation would not be a
problem for most major-league players. It
wasn’t a big problem in 1991 for Len
Dykstra when he was under the same sen-
tence.

However, Belle acts like more of a jerk
than most players. Placing him on probation
is like storing ﬁreworks at a gas station. Belle
has done everything from chasing kids down
in his truck to throwing balls and bats at

Two more Pitt grapplers are on

pounder Jacob Schaus (shoulder)
were both injured in practice last
week and were out for Saturday’s
match against conference rival West
Virginia.

The Mountaineers, ranked 25th

hogs and grizzly bears. But the beat-
up Panthers pulled out a 19-18 vic-

Pitt’s lightweights stepped it up
a notch. Chris Stevens (118), Rob
Loper (126), and Chad Jesko (134)
dominated early, earning major
decisions and giving the Panthers a
12-0 lead.

“Coach [Stottlemyer] wanted
me to beat my guy by at least eight,”
Stevens said of his 10-0 win. “We
needed to be up by at least 12 going
into 142.”

West Virginia cut the score to
12-9 with victories at the next three
weight classes.

The most exciting match of the
day was at the 167-pound weight

When Air Maile throws

they’re in trouble. That’s
exactly what happened to
Pitt’s basketball team
Saturday afternoon at
Providence, where the
Panthers bowed out to the
Friars 84-70.

Coming off a 40-point
night against national power-
house Villanova, guard Jason
Maile scored only two points
in the first half, and hit nothing
but air with his ﬁnal shot of
the day. _

Providence, on the other
hand, wasn’t so cold. Their
starters combined for 67
points and 16 assists. Pitt mus-
tered only 11 assists, consider-
ably lower than the target of
20 that Coach Ralph Wﬂlard
said he wanted from his

' squad.

Providence also beneﬁted
from the poor play of
Vonteego Cummings. He hit

only two out of seven shots,
cormnitted ﬁve turnovers, but
he did record four assists.
Cummings’ seven points for
the game is his third—lowest
total this season, ending his
six—game streak of double-
digit performances.

Providence’s probable

Austin Croshere had a big day
on the stats sheets, though. He
pulled down 12 boards, scored
a game-high 25 points, and
put on a free-throw shooting

from the charity stripe.
However, Croshere only con-
verted four of 14 shots from
the ﬂoor on the day.

“He didn’t shoot the ball
well, but we put him on the
line,” said VV1llard. “If he’s
going to get 25 points, you
want him to get them from the
ﬁeld, not the free-throw line.”

Howard, Thompson lead Lady
Panthers over Pirates, 56-54

Mike L°."¢ ... 

 

When you’re in the midst of a 10-
game losing streak,”and you’re playing on
the road in the Big East Conference, some-
times the best hope you have is to keep the
game close.

Work hard, give a maximum effort,
and try to come away with something pos-
itive to build on, right?

On Saturday aftemoon, playing on the
road against the Seton Hall Pirates, the Pitt
women’s basketball team fulfilled all of
the above objectives, with only one differ-
ence.

This time, the Lady Panthers came
away with a victory.

Pitt was able to snap its 10-game Big
East slide by way of a stunning, last—sec‘—
ond 56-54 win when Latia Howard came
through on a layup with only 5.1 seconds
remaining in the game.

Howard’s game winner came only
after an intense final minute of play, during
which the Pirates broke up a tie game and
then proceeded to give it away.

When Seton Hall’s Danielle Golay
sank two free—throws with 57.8 seconds to
play, the Pirates gained a 54-52 advantage.
However, the Lady Panthers came right
back down the court and re—tied the score
on a layup by Melissa Thompson. When
Seton Hall’s Sandy Mitchell committed an
offensive foul on the Pirates’ next posses-
sion, the stage was set for Howard’s deci-
sive shot.

“We just wanted to get the ball to
Latia,” said winning Head Coach Kirk
Bruce. “When she got the ball, she made a
nice pump—fake and just put the ball in the
basket.”

Howard led all Lady Panther scorers

with 12 points. Teanimates Melissa
Thompson and JoJo Guzman added 11
and 10 points, respectively, to help lead Pitt
to the victory.

After the game, Coach Bruce was
impressed with Howard’s performance.

“Latia had a great second half,” Bruce
said. “She was very active offensively, get-
ting to a lot of loose balls and then putting
them in for us. She also did a great job
defensively.”

After the first half of play, the Lady
Panthers were fortunate to even have the
opportunity for Howard’s heroics. The
Pirates threatened to make this game a run-
away 'in the early going, jumping out to a
quick 12-0 lead in the first three minutes.
The score was as lopsided as 26-9 at one
point late in the first half.

Seton Hall Head Coach Phyllis
Mangina lamented about her team’s appar-
ent lack of effort after forging such a large
lead.

“We jumped out to a 12-0 lead and
thought we were going to beat them pretty
badly. And then we stopped playing,” said
Mangina.

By halftime the Pirates held a 34-20
advantage, but Coach Bruce knew that the
game could still be won. _

“I just told them that we can turn this
thing around,” Bruce said. “Our main
objective for the second half was to take
the ball inside. [Seton Hall center] Dana
Wynne had a couple of fouls in the first
half, soiwe wanted to get her out of the
game. We felt that if [Wynne] was on the
bench, we could take advantage of some
rriatchups inside.”

Earlier in the game, Wynne became
Seton Hall’s all—tirne rebounding leader
with her l225th career rebound. She was

Womens’ tennis team makes history
Earns first wins ever at Pitt Invitational

Kevi li"eY   .    

 

. For the first time in the six-year his-
tory of the Pitt Invitational women’s ten-
nis tournament, the home team found the
winner’s circle.

Tamara Kalesnick won the Flight D
ﬁnals 6-1, 6-1 over the University of
Buffalo’s Amy Borden to claim Pitt’s
first—ever singles’ title in the event. The
tournament featured six singles ﬂights,
with players ranked by their coaches and
placed against suitable competition.
Kalesnick’s win made her the best
fourth-seeded player in the tournament.

Pitt also took the Flight A doubles
title, with the team of Fran Davis and
Erin Shalbrack defeating Akron’s
Colleen Hollowell and Elizabeth

Tenbroeck, 9-8. With the score tied at

eight apiece, the Panther duo won the 1

ensuing tiebreaker 7-4 to claim the vic-
tory. The Flight A win gave Davis and
Shalbrack the overall doubles title for
the Invitational.

Hollowell would avenge the doubles
loss in singles play, besting Davis in a
Flight A semifinal match. Shalbrack
dropped her Flight B semifinal game to
Akron’s Leslie Wargo, 6-3, 6-2.

In other singles action, Pitt’s Beth
Gang and Amanda Hoffman were ousted
in the semiﬁnals of their ﬂights. All four
Panthers lost out to the eventual touma-
ment winners.

No team scoring was kept in the
Invitational. The Panthers’ next team
match takes place Friday, Feb. 21 at
Mercyhurst College.

As appealing as getting rid of Belle’s

antics sounds, theie’s even more potential a

good news here. Belle was just signed for
ﬁve years by the Chicago White Sox. The
White Sox are owned by Jerry Reinsdorf,
who is almost as obnoxious as Belle.
Reinsdoif spent much of this winter whining
about how players’ salaries were rising out of
control. He promptly went out and spent $55
million on Belle. I, for one, would ﬁnd it
highly amusing if Reinsdorf’s money turns
out to be wasted on someone who isn’t even
allowed to play.

Maybe Reinsdorf would learn some-
thing from that. Maybe being on probation
will teach Belle to clean up his act. Either
way, it looks like the current baseball lords
are ﬁnally acting in the best interests of the
game.

Geoﬁ Moak is a columnist for The Pitt
News.

 

tuned—in viewers were switched to the Pitt
game, Providence was already ahead 15-
6. Three minutes later, Blount scored his

eighth point to close the gap to 18-10.

Unfortunately, this was ‘ as close as the
Panthers would get for the rest of the half.
The next four minutes belonged to the
hometown Friars, outscoring Pitt 9-2 dur-
ing that stretch, with four different players
throwing in points for Providence.

But Pitt responded with a ﬁve-
minute, 8-2 run of their own, to pull with-
in nine at 29-20.

The teams exchanged baskets for the

last 4:40 of the half, keeping Providence
on top, 38-27. After the game, Willard
expressed his displeasure for his team’s
first—half play. -

“We didn’t show any poise in the first
half, committing 15 turnovers,” said
Willard. “I can mention our seven for 13
foul shooting in the first half. We make
ﬁve or six of those, it’s a ﬁve—point game,
not an 11-point game, and it’s a whole dif-
ferent story coming out of the locker room
from a mental standpoint.”

The second half was not a whole dif-
ferent story. Providence starting things off

with a 24-12 run that found Pitt behind 62-
39, with only Blount lighting it up.

Pitt picked it up for the last 10 min-
utes of the contest, outscoring Providence
31 to 22. Kellii Taylor made the run worth
his while, scoring 15 of his 17 points in
that time period.

Wiﬂard summed the game up well
with his final post-garne comments: “We

didn’t have a lot of poise and we paid the 1

price for it.”

Georgetown travels to the Civic
Arena Wednesday for Pitt’s next game.
The contest begins at 7 p.m.

W-hoops

already the Big East Conference’s a1l—time
leading rebounder. Wynne finished the
game with 9 boards to give her a career
total of 1230.

Danielle Golay led the Pirates with 20
points’ in a losing effort.

With the victory in conference play,
Pitt now owns a Big East record of 3-12,
with an overall record 8-18.

 

Coach Bruce expressed his relief
about the end of his team’s losing streak.

“You never want to get into a losing
streak. A game like this builds conﬁdence
for us. It’s always a good conﬁdence
builder to win on the road, but now is an
especially good time with UConn coming
up,” said Bruce. “We’ll see if we can put
something together with the Big East tour-

The Lady Panthers visit the first-
ranked Connecticut Huskies this
Wednesday night, Feb. 19.

Earlier this past week in Big East
action, the Pitt women had dropped a 89-

61 contest away from home against the '

Miami Hurricanes. Alecia Balich led the
Lady Panthers with 15 points in the loss.
