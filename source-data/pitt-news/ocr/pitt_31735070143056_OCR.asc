A liver on a lymph node

Professor receives grant to grow organ replacement cells in lymphatic system

A new liver grown from a human
lymph node? .

It might sound like science ﬁc-
tion, but one Pitt professor be-
lieves the novel technique could
save the lives of people with ter-
minal organ failure.

 

technique with the help of a recent

$2.9 million grant from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health.

The grant, which extends over
a ﬁve-year period, will help La-
gasse and his six to eight-member
team pioneer the technique in
animal models, contributing to
a long-term project which could
eventually lead to clinical trials
in humans.

In the long_ run, I’m hoping to save lives.
That is the dream of a lot of scientists.

Eric Lagasse

“The idea is sort of new. No-
body has done this before,” said

Eric Lagasse, an associate profes—.

sor in the School of Medicine’s

C pathology department. “We

thought [it] was a very interest-
ing approach.”

Lagasse and his team are re-
searching the organ regeneration

Lagasse said_that when patients
exhibit degenerative diseases, af-
fected organs sometimes become
too damaged to transplant, and
medication or cell therapy fails.

“So far, there is no solution for
these people,” he said.’

But by using organ cells, he and
his team of researchers are look-

ing at the human body’s more than
500 lymph nodes for the solution.
The lymph nodes produce white
blood cells to attack pathogens
when triggered. ~
“We can turn this into other
types of tissue,” he said. “What
we’re saying is that the lymph
node is a great place [for organ
regeneration].”
F For the study, Lagasse and his
researchers will inject cells from
body organs, such as the liver,

‘pancreas and thymus — an or-

gan that creates white blood cells
during childhood — into lymph
nodes. The injection will cause a
new organ to grow ectopically, or
outside where the organ would
usually reside. '
Lagasse said the eventual goal

' is to grow new organs for termi-

nal patients, including those with
end-stage liver disease, insulin de-
ﬁciencies or a missing thymus.

But at this stage, the research
is not yet clinical.

“To test it, you have to try dif-
ferent approaches until you are
very sure that it will work in pa-
tients,” Lagasse said, adding that

G—2O committee might not focus on allegations of police brutality

A new Pittsburgh City Council
committee, approved two weeks
ago, will focus on analyzing the
costs of the G—2O Summit. It will
not necessarily discussallegations
of police brutality in detail.

A city ofﬁcial, who asked to re-
main anonymous because legisla-
tion is pending, said city council’s

. G-20 Committee willylook at the

cost — in terms of money, pub-

lic safety and human rights — of
hosting the G—2O and archive that
information for the future.

She said the committee will
brieﬂy consider Pitt students’ ac-
counts of the events in Oakland
to determine how they affected
the monetary cost of the Summit.
She said some council members
have talked about creating an inde-
pendent committee to investigate

how students and ofﬁcers inter-
acted with one another during the

 

Summit. No council members have
introduced legislation for the ad-
ditional committee yet.

The G—20 Committee has not
met yet, Its members — some of
whom have yet to be determined
— will include members of the

‘council committees on Finance

and Law, Public Safety and Inter-
governmental Affairs, as well as
the City Controller, the Director
of Public Safety and two of his ap-
pointees. ’ ﬂ
City Council members said

in council documents that they
created the G-20 Committee to
conduct “objective fact-ﬁnding in
matters associated with the deci-
sion to host the G—20, the planning
and preparation for the event, the
costs of the event and contribu-
tions -—- monetary and in-kind
—- from other governments, and
the operational decisions made
leading up to the event.”

Surveysays most people  
wouldn’t use H1N1 vaccine

Liz Navratil
News Editor

The majority of Americans wouldn’t
use an emergency H1N1 virus vac-
cine, according to new research from
Pitt and the University of Georgia.
Sandra Quinn, associate dean of
student affairs and a professor in the
Graduate School of Public Health,

worked with three Pitt research as-.

sociates and a University of Georgia
professor to survey 1,543 people. The
group found that 63 percent of peo-
ple would not take a “new, but not yet
approved” vaccine for H1N1.

Congress passed an act in 2004,
the Project Bioshield Act, that allows
the Food and Drug Administration
to distribute medicines that haven’t
been through the normal testing
cycle in emergencies. A

Forty-six percent of the people the
team surveyed said they were con-
cerned about getting H1N1.

Quinn said shethinks part of peo-

has to do with their upbringings.

“Most of us  all had childhood

She added that it was also pos-
sible that people might have a hard

time distinguishing credible medical '

sites from people’s blogs and thus
read information on the Internet that
would cause them to panic about tak-
ing an emergency-use vaccine.
Quinn said her team hopes to
conduct an additional round of ques-
tioning later this month or in Novem-

a clinical trial might not be available for at
least eight more years. ,

The team is already working with liver
cells in animal models. Before making any
attempts at a human clinical trial, it plans
to test human organ growth in animals
by transplanting human cells to the test
animal. - «

Lagasse said he’s been traveling to de-
liver lectures to fellow scientists, and so far
his research ideas have been well—received

_ in the scientiﬁc community. .

“People are very surprised by this ap-
proach, but they are very interested,” he
said. 4 I

And his peers aren’t the only ones im-
pressed by the research proposal.’

Lagasse received a new type of grant
from the National Institutes of Health —
the T-R01 — that is intended only for ex-
perimental and high-risk projects.

While there was no requirement for
T—RO1 applicants to focus on speciﬁc areas
of research, organ regeneration is an excit-
ing and up-and-coming ﬁeld, Kristin Abra-

    

earns $30million grant

ham, of the National Institutes of Health’s
Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and

Metabolic Diseases, said.

“This is an area that is of very high inter-
est to NIH,” she said. “We want to invest in
 exploring-the idea.”

Abraham said while the National Insti-
tutes of Health annually awards grants to
researchers, the T—RO1 is different because
it does not impose a budget cap; require a
team member limit or demand preliminary
data before the grant is given.

Instead, it is intendedto support the
development of “edgy” research projects
—— even if they fail, Abraham said.

. “Whether it works or not, we will know
at the end if the approach is worth moving
forward with or not,” Abraham said, “and
’that’s important.” r

Lagasse-and his team are among the 42
groups of researchers awarded the new
grant. .

In its inaugural year, the awards —
whichtotaled $30 million — were granted
to research teams from Harvard, University
of North Carolina, Columbia, Stanford and
Vanderbilt, among others.

“This will help us tremendously because
this will now allow us to have the ﬁnances
behind this new idea and concept,” Lagasse
said of the grant award.

But Lagasse said a research project of

g this cost is not unusual.

“Of course, we are very happy to have
this money. It will be spent well, but it will
be no problem to spend it,” he said.

Lagasse said he is optimistic of the re-
search.

In translating the 1ab‘work_to, clin‘ilcal..q, .
applications, he said the ultimate’ goal is" f

to uncover new medical approaches to ter-
minal patients. ‘

“In °the‘lorng run, I’m hoping to save

Pitt volleyball records fl1’St
ever win over Louisville

l Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Ever 2005, when Louisville joined
the Big East, the Pitt women’s
volleyball team had yet to win a
match against the Cardinals.
That is, until the Panthers went

4 to Louisville last weekend.

The Panthers notched their
ﬁrst victory over the Cardinals,
in a thrilling ﬁve—match tilt, with
a 15-12 victory in the last set of
the match.

The match was close through-
out,'and the Panthers came from

“ behind in the ﬁfth deciding set

to beat ‘the defending Big East

champions. .
The Panthers (11-7, 3-1 Big

East) moved into a tie for second

place in the Big East — joining ‘

Syracuse and Connecticut -— after
the win. '

“We were really aggressive,
and the focus, I thought, was re-
ally good from start to ﬁnish,” Pitt
coach Toby Rens said.

The Panthers ﬁnished strong
in the match against a Louisville
team that was picked to win the

' Big East ina preseason poll.

In the ﬁfth set, the Panthers
had 11 kills on 25 attempts for
a .280 hitting percentage, their
highest hitting percentage in the

entire match.

Offensively, the Panthers had
four‘ players notch double-digit
kills. ~

Senior Meagan Dooley led
the Pitt attack with 22 kills, four
blocks and a .487 hitting percent-
age, while senior Melissa Stadel—
manhad 15 kills and seven digs.

 

So many people
stepped up
throughout the

V match.
’ Toby Rens

Junior Amy Town notched a
double-double for the match,
posting 13 kills and 15 digs.

Senior Allyson Hodnik also
had a doubleedouble, collecting
67 assists and 10 digs. ‘

“So many people stepped up
throughout the match,” Rens said.
“We were deﬁnitely led by Mea-
gan. She scored 26 points total,
but players like Michelle Walker
came off the bench and had seven
kills. For a freshman coming off
the bench, she did really good for
that.” P

“Rens also said Dooley, along

with junior Imani Harper, were _
_ key in shutting down Louisville’s

powerful middle—hitters. ’

“I thought Meagan and Imani
did a-great job controlling their
middle-s,” Rens said. “[Louis—
ville’s] Lecia Brown has one_of
the highest hitting percentages

in the country, and we held her 1

to a .167 average, and the other
middle, we held her to a low hit-
ting percentage.”

Pitt lost its ﬁrst match of the
weekend 3-1 to Cincinnati, anoth-
er team picked to ﬁnish ahead of
Pitt in the preseason poll.

Rens said he wasn’t pleased I

with Pitt’s sloppy play on Satur-
day.

“We had 13‘service errors and
no aces against Cincinnati, and
as far as passing, we had seven

reception errors,” he said. “I 2

think that_was our worst" number
all season.” .

' Against the Cardinals, the
Panthers had four reception er-
rors and ﬁve service errors in ﬁve
sets.

“We, wanted to rebound from a
loss to a quality team,” Rens said.
“We were a little disappointed be-
cause we feel like we didn’t play
our best. We did a good job ‘of
focusing on match day against
Louisville and put the Cincinnati
loss behind us.”

the Paul Short Invitational held

The 8-kilometer race was the
tﬁrd for the Panthers so far this
year. .

“We try to run to our potential,
and I think we came close to our
potential this weekend,” Pitt coach
Clinton Bell said. “Unfortunately,

%~ competition was stiff. Two ' ‘I

‘years ago, we would haveplaced
in the upper echelon.” S

Christopher, a junior, ﬁnished
ﬁrst for the Panthers, recording a
time of 24 minutes, 55 seconds —
