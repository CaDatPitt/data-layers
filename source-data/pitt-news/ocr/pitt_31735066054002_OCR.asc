Two Bosnian women sit down
to drink tea. Both have no legs.

A Cambodian man lies on a
hospital bed, a recent victim of a
landmine blast, writhing in pain,
his legs torn to shreds and shards
of metal burned into his torso.

A young boy on crutches, who
lost his right leg during the civil
war, hobbles through the streets
of Kabul, Afghanistan, examining
ruined buildings.

These were three pictures of
landmine victims presented by
Australian photographer John
Rodsted last night at a lecture in
McCluskey Auditorium at
Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital.

inate killer. They are designed to

blow up, kill or maim any person,
at random, whether he or she is a
soldier, a mother, or a child," said
Rodsted, traveling on the
Landmines Ban Bus along with
six international activists pressing
for a worldwide ban on the manu-
facture and use of landmines.
The Ban Bus is traveling
across the United States for six
weeks, urging the U.S.
Government to add its name to a
treaty, which would effectively
ban landmines, being signed on
Dec. 3 and 4 in Ottawa, Canada.
The U.S. is not one of the 120
nations signing the treaty.
Rodsted said that by nature,
landmines are illegal according to
the terms of the Geneva
Convention.

cian, mine manufacturer, general

decided. that a 13-year-old
Bosnian boy should be a victim?"
asked Rodsted.

Michael Hands, a deminer,
who searches for and clears areas
of landmines, said that mines can
detonate 75 years after they were
planted. He cited them as a brutal
killer of innocent people.

"If you're lucky enough to be
alive, you'll go through years of
agonizing pain, and that's if
there's rehabilitation," said
Hands. He added that rehabilita-
tion is not so readily available to
victims in countries such as
Cambodia, Mozambique,
Chechnya and Bosnia, where
"landmines' brutal legacy will
still be felt for generations to
come."

Pitt prof who helped create

News Asslstant

In the last few years of his life, Charles C.
Brinton Jr. could be seen wheeling himself to
the Immunology class he designed and taught at
Pitt.

He was the only professor who had taught
the class until this semester, when he took a sab-
batical due to his declining health from Lou
Gehrig’s disease. He died on October 24. He
was 71 years old.

His wife, Sarah Wood, teaches the class for
him this semester, but she has done so with a lot
of help from Brinton.

David Burgess, chair of the Biological
Sciences Department, says Brinton was an
exceptional teacher whose lose has shook the
department.

"I can't tell you who will teach immunology
class next year," Burgess said. "We can find
someone to teach the class, but we will never
replace Charlie."

In the past two years of his life, Brinton pro-
duced two educational videos for his immunolo-
gy class, in addition to designing the class cur-
riculum itself.

According
Brinton's former

to Nicole Earnest, one of
students, the class was

MINES

Mette Sosie Eliseussen, a
Norwegian mine-awareness instruc-
tor, described her time in Kabul
teaching Afghan children the danger
of landmines, and how-to avoid them.
She showed the audience drawings by
Afghan children of landmine victims,
landmine-infested .1 countryside and
building‘ ruins. _

"It's so chaotic, so traumatic,
children seeing their own body being
blown apart," said Eliseussen. "I've
talked to many kids who have seen
others lying dead or crippled in‘ the
minefields."

In Kabul, Eliseussen said she was
always on the lookout for landmines,
because they could be found any-
where. A

"They put them in buildings,
under cars, under old cars that have
been blown up before," said
Eliseussen. "They even put them in

trees. There is no such a place as a
safe place for children to play in

Kabul."

Paul Piattio, veteran and member
of the Vietnam Veterans of America
Foundation, said that President
Clinton is afraid to take a stand and
sign the treaty because of pressure
from the military.

"[Clinton] is a coward for not
standing up to the military," Piattio
added. "The Pentagon is petrified that
civilians want to take a weapons sys-

tem away from them."

All four speakers appealed to the
audience to actively lobby for their
cause.

"We need to keep this in the
media spotlight; we need to keep this
in their face," said Piattio.

aHe pointed to Rothsted's, pho-
tographs of landmine victims, saying,
"Speak for those who can't speak." ‘

BRINTON

designed to be team taught. But, it
was only team taught in that
Brinton brought in guest speakers
who were specialists in areas of the
course and could better explain the
concepts.

Brinton's passion in life was to
discover ways to combat bacterial
diseases such as salmonella,
cholera and gonorrhea, according to
Burgess. Brinton also worked on
vaccines for ear infections in chil-
dren and for the ﬂu.

Brinton's most notable scientif-
ic contribution came in the 1950s
when he was a graduate student at
Pitt. He was a member of the team
that discovered small, hair-like
appendages called pili used for
movement by bacteria. « -

' Sam To, the senior scientist for
Brinton's research company Bactex
who worked with Brinton for 25
years, said this discovery was a cul-
mination of both great scientific
thinking and the newest technologi-
cal development, namely the elec-
tron microscope. ,

Despite all Brinton's scientific
accomplishments, the people who
worked with him would say that his
biggest contribution was his atti-
tude. .

Brinton was a very optimistic,
can-do type of person, according to
To.

"That's a very important charac-
teristic in a scientist," To said. "He
was willing to confront failure."

FROM PAGE 1

"He didn't even even quit in the
last three years of his life when
[Lou Gehrig's disease] was getting
the best of him," To said. "He
worked more diligently than ever,
because there were things that he
wanted to be discovered."

According to Burgess, Brinton
worked up until the the end of his
life.

"He worked on Friday —- and
died the following Sunday,"
Burgess said.

Earnest said Brinton helped to
push all of his students to achieve.

"He did everything he could to
help you learn. He went out of his
way," she said. "I've never had any-
body treat me like that."

She also mentioned that Brinton
never gave up and that this attitude
rubbed off on every person with
whom he came into contact.

To said the Chinese have an old
story about a wise man who could
always find the best wild horses
just by watching them run.
Everybody needed a good horse, so
the wise man told them which ones
were the best ones, according to To.

To said that people are the same
way — there are many great ones
out there, but only people who can
find great people are rare.

Dr. Charles Brinton Jr. was that
kind of man, To said. As a scientist,
he always needed to find the perfect
person to do a job, and he was a
master at this.

Curtis Smith won't teach you how to kill
someone, but he will teach you conﬁdence
and whip you into shape if you enroll in his
upcoming Fitness Kickboxing course.

The ﬁtness instructor, Pitt Police oﬂicer,
police trainer and self-proclaimed master of
martial arts says this following one of his
Fitness Boxing classes, which was oifered
this semester at Trees Hall. Meanwhile,
some of his students who have decided to
hang around after class are jumping rope,
others are stretching and a couple with taped
hands circle each other, whipping out quick
jabs, uppercuts and front snap kicks.

"You could bill this as a selfrlefense
course," Smith said. "You are learning a
valuable skill. But we emphasize the ﬁtness
mode of this, the wellness mode of it."

Learning to kill is not the idea as much
as is getting in shape with a good workout,
according to Smith. The Fitness Boxing and
Fitness Kickboxing classes are about "get-
ting in shape and becoming a trained ath-
lete."

Smith conveys a great sense of pride in
the class he teaches by the excitement he
exudes describing it. He claims that his class
is one of the best around. Many have popped
up around the country as ﬁtness boxing has
become something of a fad, but he says that
outside observers who have compared sev-
eral classes cite his as the best.

Smith has several assistant instructors,
which he says is an "uncommon concep "
among such programs, which typically have
only one instructor leading the class. When
trying to teach technical movements, like
some of those found in boxing, Smith said

that having extra instructors who can move

around the room provides an "enormous
amount of coaching" that is very helpful.
The equipment involved is something

to brag about, according to Smith. Indeed,
one of the ﬁrst things you notice walking
into his class in the Multipurpose Room is
the array of heavy bags, portable punch-

ing/kicking bags and speed bags lining the T

matted area in the back ofthe room.

Smith says he likes to vary the program
from class to class to keep students interest-
ed. He tries everything from changing the
aerobic routine, to an occasional "aqua aero-
bics" workout in the small pool at Trees Hall.

The main difference between next
semester’s Fitness Kickboxing class and the
regular Fitness Boxing class will be, not sur-
prisingly, kicks.

"The students want more classes,"
Smith said, explaining what prompted him
to start the new class and add more variety.

Therese Tallarico started in Smith's
Fitness Boxing class over two years ago, and
became an assistant instructor during her
second semester in the class.

"It's the best class, an awesome work-
out," Tallarico said. "It works out all your
aggressions when you're stressed."

She said two things beckoned her to
return after her first semester: Srnith‘s
knowledge and enthusiasm. According to
Tallarico, Smith knows the technique,
knows what he's teaching, and excites and
motivates people. .

She added that she also likes the loud
music played during workouts. Not only
does it make the physical activity less
tedious, it helps students develop rhythm.

"People who didn't have rhythm before
all of a sudden have rhythm," she said. P

But by and large, the best thing about
the class is how it makes you feel, claimed
Tallarico. Being in shape is wonderful, and
knowing a few techniques, even just how to
block an attackers punches, gives conﬁ-
dence to her and the other students.

"You have conﬁdence that you can do
this s ," she said. "The conﬁdence --

’that's the most important part of it."

AndacompanyintheUnitedStates ofArrrericarnade
thousands of dollars on the deal

That’s why the United States won’t be one of the 120
nations to sign a  banning landmines next month in
Ottawa, Canada , .

The United States is the largest producer of anti-personnel
mines in the world We make them, we plant them in foreign
soils, and we sell them to other countries so they can do the
same.
The United States argues that we use landmines responsi-

bly, marking and mapping mineﬁelds and removing them all '
when we pull out of an occupied area. You can almost imag-.

ine hearing our politicians call our military’s policy “humani-

tarian,” or some hogwash like that.

The United States is unwilling to sign a treaty that would
save lives, just so we can make a few bucks.

The anti-landrnine treaty would require all its participants
to cease manufacturing landmines and to remove all currently
planted mines from its home soil.

Presently (aside from the militia groups in Michigan who
have booby-trapped their front yards in case the FBI shows up
asking questions), there are very few landrrrines on American
soil. It wouldn’t take that much effort for the United States to
comply with that part of the treaty. _ .

As for defensive purposes, laser beam perimeter alanns
and sentries with riﬂes will work just as well as a landrrrine in
protecting a military camp. Give the sentries a megaphone and
handcuffs, and they might even be able to take prisoners with-
out killing anybody.

But to stop manufacturing landmines? To stop selling
them to other countries not signing the treaty, so they can set
unmarked, umnapped mineﬁelds that they won’t clean up?
That would jeopardize our gross national product.

And that, well, that’s just unacceptable.

Isn’t it?

Wouldn’t it be much better for our nation to make a prof-
it on the lives of other countries’ children?

Where's the sex? Where's the booze?

James Maude
Columnist V

I have been criticized for not
getting to the point. So, here it is:

If you’re going to throw a
party, whether it’s a birthday,
engagement or frmeral, make sure
you do it right. That means“ lots of
frm things — like women, alcohol,
music to savage the ears and, um,
more alcohol.

Which brings me to an inci-
dentthathappenedtomeandmy
friends, Shaun and Darren, last
year in South Africa. Leoni, a girl
rather light on the intelligence fac-
tor, decided to host a party. It was
probably her boyfriend Paul’s (an
Afrikaner whose name is pro-
nounced “Pole”) idea, so it was
doomed from the beginning. ’

Another friend of mine,
Kenneth (Lordy, he has three
friends!), was asked by Leoni to
bring as many ﬁiends as humanly
possible.

Promises of sex, promises of
booze, she even promised that
Shaun could nail her rather attrac-
tive sister, Elmari, on the pool
table. Being a relatively naive fel-
low, I fell for it as soon as Kenneth
relayed the invitation on to me.
Kenneth, prone to exaggeration,

blew up Leoni’s promises some

more. Elrnari’s friend, Rika (these
are Afrikaans names by the way),
was added to the pool table equa-
tion. From out of Kermetlr’s red
head yonder, a bathtub of vodka
martini emerged.

Then, it was my turn to exag-

_ gerate; While Shaun and Darren

drooled over the models in a Toys
“R” Us catalog, I asked if they
wanted to come to the party. I
addedthatDarren and Shaun could

nail Elmari, in turns, on the pool
table, and Rika, in the vodka mar-
tini bathtub. They expressed
doubts. I said Leoni was renting
John “Buttman” Stagliano’s new
ﬁlm for the evening — that won
them over.

The saddest thing - about
expectation is when reality sets in.
The innocence, then the experi-
ence, if you will. We turned up at
Leoni’s place, a small holding on
the outskirts of Midrand, 20 miles
north of Johannesbmg, in a lively
swagger, armed with Hooch (the
alcoholic fruit pop). Carling Black
Label andabagfullofdomes (a
colloquial term for contraceptives)
which would give a buffalo a her-
nia. Driving in my Toyota Raider
(the South Aﬁican equivalent of
the 4Rurrner), we were in the mood
for lots of decadent Roman style
partying .

But for every Louis XVI,
there are at least 15 Oliver
Cromwells. Instead of landing in a
sea of debauchery, we landed in an
ocean of bring-’_rr-braai (a South
African colloquialism — a bar-
beque) 1950s backyard American
hell. What big thing did Leoni
neglect to tell us? Name two peo-
ple who generally turn ﬁivolity
into sobriety. Yes, Leoni forget to
tell us that her parents were there.
Unless Leoni Groemor and her
parents were like the Mansons, I
couldn’t see the pool table scene
carrying on. I

Kenneth arrived before us, but
he was with his sex-mad girlfriend
Samantha, so he wasn’t quite as
shocked by the lack of shocking
things to notice. The chips were
brought out, and Leoni’s 8-year-
old cousin joined the group. No
Sepultura here, but Yanni’s music

PITT NEWS

had the kids grooving (in a
Silverstonesque voice, “As if!”).
Rika was christened Sack ‘o Taties
(sack of potatoes) by Darren,
because she was so dull. And for
entertaimnent, Shaun started
chewing ice “cubes.

_, During the ﬁrst half hour,
Darren, Shaun _and I downed three
Hooches each. Leoni’s grandad
turned up, wearingonly his boxer
shorts. Most of the group left us
after35 minutestogotothevideo

Columnist’

it Continuing in the vein of my last
piece about relationships (which, if I
think about it, is probably not a good
idea at all), I have come up with some
more useless crap about what we tend to
put ourselves through in the desperate
attempt tofulfrlleither our emotional or
hormonal cravings. Actually, this piece

_ is more about the latter two distinctions

than about relationships in general.

We human beings are complicated
animals. We are possessed of a wide
range of emotions and capable of
thoughts of infinite complexity. At least,
most of us would like to think so. Unlike
all other forms of animal life, we are
capable of communicating using means
of corresponding complexity (Yes, I

i, know other animals can communicate,

but in general it seems to be limited to
discussions involving other animals in
the immediate vicinity on the food chain,
as opposed to quantum theory or the
palette of a particular wine).

Well, perhaps the language itself is
not all that complex. Although the
English language contains some quarter
of a million words, which can be com-
bined in an amazing array of conﬁgura-
tions (the 50 monkeys with the 50 type-
writers still haven’t come up with the
tiniest bit of Shakespeare), there are still

THE PITT NEWS

There just aren't any words for what we really mean sometimes

limits to what mere language can con-
vey.

This problem becomes manifest
every time I try to tell somebody some-
thing in writing, whether it is an excuse
for an overdue term paper or a reminder
that yes, you really do still owe me $50.
It is also apparent whenever I try to write
this column. But the main problem with
the written word is that it doesn’t have
the immediacy of a face-to—face conver-
sation. It does, however, allow you to
collect your thoughts and get them into
some semblance of coherence before
expressing them. And when you are try-
ing to tell someone what you think about
them without appearing to be a total jerk,
this matters.

Speaking to somebody in person has
its own problems, though. Unless your
name is Fabio or something (and speak-
ing for myself, I’m glad it’s not), you are
probably going to have a hard time
mouthing the buttery compliments and
terms of endearment that the object of
your attention wants to hear, without get-
ting your geeky high—top sneakers firmly
wedged in your mouth. But at least you
may be able to get -the point across that
you care, albeit in a not entirely urbane
or sophisticated manner.

Now, to return to the point I men-
tioned earlier. It seems that some people
are only interested in physical relation-
ships — biology and Freud triumphing

over something a little more cerebral. Or
to put it crassly, they just want to get laid.
For these people, communication is a
means to an end —— nothing particularly
meaningful other than
a rather effective form
of ﬂattery. At least, so
it seems sometimes.
How many times have
you seen someone you
know who is utterly
insincere when trying
to convince someone
else that he/she thinks
that person is the most
wonderful being in the
universe and that
he/she wants to be
together forever and
ever, and whatever else
he/she can come up with? For those of us
not Machiavellian enough to resort to
such tactics, this can be extremely
annoying, to say the least.

The problem with insincerity as I see
it is that it has a tendency to destroy the
credibility of all of the rest of the people
who actually mean what they are saying.
So really, next time you are pulling some
killer pickup line out of wherever you
pull your pickup lines, remember that all
you will end up doing is making it hard
for yourself.

But that’s not anything you didn’t
know already. I hope.

 

    

Tuesday, 18 November 1997

 

So, whether your preferred method
of communication is written or verbal,
you are still going to run into problems,
be it in expressing what you really feel or
ensuring that what you
express comes across
as genuine. Either way,
it appears, you can’t
win.

So what’s the
solution? Good ques-
tion. I have no idea.
See, I have my own
problems in this area
myself (you knew that
was coming, didn’t
you?). I mean, look at
this column.

One
‘' think that aperson with
such a great faculty for the language

would

(right) would have no trouble expressing

himself. One would be wrong. And don’t
even ask about my speaking skills.

So what do I have to say? Other than
complaining about the limitations of my
own communication abilities, not much.
But lies never did anything but hurt peo-
ple. So don’t do it, OK?

This has been a public service
announcement. Thank you.

hemy j. mason would like to tell every-
body that  well, he just can ’t ﬁnd the
words for it right now.

U. 5. sanctions,
mid-east policy
are’ harmful

In response to Alison Novicki’s column
on Iraq from Nov. 11: Novicki’s column is a
cheap attempt to evoke hatred toward Iraqis
and Arabs in general. First of all, if the Iraqis
hate the U.S., then they are justified, because
the U.S. has pushed for imposing sanctions
on Iraq that have resulted in a shortage of
food and medicine, and is causing the death
of thousands of Iraqi children every year.

Second, Novicki argues that Iraq’s
hatred of the U.S. is the problem, but I say
that the source of the problem is the irra-
tional and biased U.S. foreign policy in the
Middle East. Why is this the case? The
answer is that the U.S. foreign policy on the
Middle East doesn’t reﬂect the American
national interest in the long run. The forrnu—
lation of this foreign policy is dominated by
AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs
Committee] and other Zionist groups,
whose only goal is to serve Israel’s domi-
nance in that region.

Why impose sanctions on Iraq claiming
that Iraq had violated or did not comply with
U.N. resolutions and attacked neighboring

countries, when no sanctions are imposed on ,

Israel‘? Israel is the one who is the big bully
in the Middle East. Israel has been attacking

It is time for us to become more ratio-

against people just because they are a certain

put a stop to the sanctions imposed on Iraq,
because these sanctions are only hurting the

Gay Jeans Day
is a bad idea

I disagree with “Gay Jeans Day.” I
understand the reasons behind it, namely to
show homo- and bi—affect:ionate students
that the whole world is not against them and
that they do have supporters among their
straight friends, classmates and colleagues.

However, I disagree with the method
chosen to achieve this goal. I personally
resent that fact that I am being forced to

   

 sarne-sex or three—party marriages; if I do
. .   .2--41  r  .-  I .    not wear jeans, I run the risk of inadvertent-
tries and occupying

ly (and incorrectly) portraying myself as a
homophobic hatemonger. As a Christian, I
believe in fostering a spirit of mutual
respect, love and friendship amongst all peo-

ple, but by no means do I embrace a fully

laissez-faire worldview.

And what about people who are not
100-percent supportive, but own no other
pants? They are forced either to make a
statement contradictory to their beliefs, or to
spend money on other clothing. This is pol-
itics by coercion. I also carmot help but feel
sorry for the people who did not hear about
Gay Jeans Day and who show up wearing
clothing that makes a statement —— either
way —— with which they may disagree.

I do not believe that Gay Jeans Day is a
malicious attempt to polarize the campus,
but rather a ﬂawed idea which was not ade-
quately thought out; in either case, the result
is still the same. So when you see me in
khakis on Gay Jeans Day, it is most certain-
ly not because I hate anyone; I am protesting
against an event which forces me to choose
between what I see as two bad choices.

Learn the
ways of the

black & gold

This is a tale of two cities.

Two football teams.

And two opposing theories on how to
win in the NFL.

This saga began in December 1994
when the Philadelphia Eagles visited a near
riot-level Three Rivers Stadium. It was a
typical Pittsburgh winter day. It ﬂurried on
and off all game, and it was cold —- damn
cold

The Birds scored ﬁrst on a ﬁeld goal.
But that would be it for the Eagles offense.
Cunningham was knocked down, picked oﬂ°
and embarrassed by a Steelers defense for
the rest of the Eagles’ humiliation.

Philadelphia dropped its remaining
games to ﬁnish with a 7-9 record and
received the dubious honor of being the ﬁrst
teaminNFLhistorytostarttheseason7-2
and not make the playoffs.

The Steelers went to theAFC title game
andledrnostoftlregame,butlostinthe
fourth quarter to the underdog San Diego
Chargers. It was a demoralizing end to a
breakout season for the black and gold

In the oﬂ°-season the Steelers said au
revoir to running back Barry Foster, o1Ten-
sive lineman [eon Searcy and defensive
coordinator Dom Capers. The Eagles rid
themselves of their mindless head coach and
the over-priced Walker.

Andthisis wherethetwodistincttlreo-
ries begin.

The Steelers ﬁlled in their holes on the
oﬂ’ensive line with draftees, and Foster’s
backup, Barn Morris, supplanted him as the
offensive workhorse.

On the other/moronic side of general
management, the Eagles signed Super Bowl
champ Ricky “rrmning” Watters to a lucra-
tive four-year contract when they already
had an up-and-coming Charlie Gamer.
Later, Philly would realize that the running
in Watters name was put there more for his
running of the mouth than the football.

Heading into the 1995 season, new
Eagle Offensive Coordinator John Gruden
was focused on installing the latest fad in the
NFL (and right here at the University of
Pittsburgh) —— the West Coast offense.
Cunningham could not read the opposing
defense squads quick enough and was
forced out of his starting position and then
the league a year later.

The Eagles’ answer was Rodney Peete.
The same shmuck who couldn’t win a start-
ing job against such slouches as Andre Ware
and Don Majikowski in Detroit The sad
part of the Eagles’ season was that they ﬁn-

Pitt’s Ralph Willard
must have the worst luck
among college basketball
coaches.

Last year’s squad was
plagued with injuries, and
already this season he has
had to handle the loss of two
of his highly touted recruits.

And now he has to deal
with the loss of last year’s
Big East leader in steals,
guard Kellii Taylor, due to a
stress fracture.

However, Willard was
not concerned by the fact that
he only had seven players
available for the tearn’s first
game against the Bucknell
Bisons last night. Rather, he
was worried about how those
seven would respond to all of

the playing time.

The young Panthers
struggled in the first half, but
overcame a two-point half-
time deficit to defeat

Bucknell 74-67 in front of

6,104 fans at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

“I am very proud of the
effort we gave tonight,”
Willard said. “Our effort was
just outstanding. We only
had 12 turnovers tonight.
That is a staggering number
for a young team.”

The Panthers jumped out
to a 11-5 lead following a
Ricardo Greer alley-oop and
an Isaac Hawkins reverse
layup that brought the crowd
to its feet, sparking a
Bucknell time out.

However, Pittsburgh
native J.R. Holden kept the
Bison in the ganre, scoring

16 of his game-high 27
points in the first half.

Then the Panthers began
to accumulate fouls and
make mental mistakes, but
still managed to lead 32-31

The Walt Harris press conference cer-
tainly had its ups and downs this week
After a heart-wrenching 32-27 loss to
Syracuse this past Saturday, there was
much to be said concerning the Panthers’
football season and its future. .

Upon further review, a fumble that was
never called and a questionable touchdown
pass left both Walt Harris’ squad and the
fans with thoughts of “what might have
been.” Harris, however, remained opti-
mistic about the rest of the season and the
future of Pitt’s football program.

"Ihe Temple and Boston College loss-
es were diﬂicult for me, along with this
one,” said Hanis. “Our seniors want to
leave us with something. They want to
leave this program with some legacy.”

Harris was impressed with the way the
Panthers fought back during their corne-
back by citing senior leadership as a key
factor.

‘The Syracuse game showed we have
it in us, but we just have to bring it out,” said

get beat like last year, especially our
seniors.”

Amid the fourth-quarter comeback,
the Panthers suffered a huge blow by losing
John Jones to a broken ﬁbia for the remain-
der of the season.

“John Jones was operated on Saturday

night. He seemed to be in good spirits
despite a great deal of pain. He’s out for the
rest of the season. Hopefully he can gain
about 25 pounds and line up at defensive
end for us next year,” Harris said.

Harris also commented on recruiting
and what type of players Pitt is looking for.

Reclemtion for Holden ar eing overlooked  

Ned Schano
Senior Staff Wrlter

The Pitt Panther’s ﬁrst regular season
basketball game turned into a showcase of
two of Pennsylvariia’s best point guards.

Sure, most people know about
Vonteego Cummings, Pit1’s leading scorer
and a preseason ﬁrst-team Big East selec-
tion. But fewer people know J.R. Holden,
the preseason Patriot League Player of the
Year candidate and Buc1cnell’s unheralded
one-man scoring machine.

The 6-foot-1 Holden hails from
Wilkinsburg, only a 10-minute drive from
the Fitzgerald Field House. Yet, despite his
proximity to Pitt, Holden was not recniited
by the Panthers.

Holden did his best to make the
Panthers regret their decision not to recniit
him. He scored a game—high 27 points for
the Bison and turned more than a few heads
with his lightning quick ﬁrst step.

Bucknell’s Head Coach Pat Flannery,
for one, was glad the Panthers let his play-
maker slip by.

“We’ve been real fortunate to have
him,” Flannery said.

- Holden said he did his best to make his
Pittsburgh homecoming a memorable one.

‘Holden added seven assists in his 39

‘Cummings countered with 20 points

“I was nervous at ﬁrst,” Holden
said. “But after the ﬁrst three or four
minutes, I got into the ﬂow.”

In addition to his 27 points,
minutes. Not to be outdone,
and eight assists, while suffering from
the ﬂu. The illness kept Cummings
out of practice on Thursday and
Friday and forced him to take medica-
tion to stop him from vomiting at half-
time.

“I can’t say enough of that kid,”
said Head Coach Ralph Willard. “He
had no energy in the second half. How
he got through the half was beyond
me.”

Appropriately, Cummings and
Holden were matched against one
another for most of the game. Both
players were familiar with each other,
for the two standouts played pickup
games together this summer at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The two guards provided the
offensive spark for their teams. The Bucknell
guard held the early advantage over his
counterpart, stripping Cummings twice in a
row early in the ﬁrst half, once converting

With the Big East Conference
Championships one week away, the
Pittsburgh Lady Panthers ﬁnished up their
regular season schedule by splitting a pair of
games against Connecticut and St. John’s.

Pitt traveled to Storrs, Conn. on Saturday
to face the Lady Huskies and were handed a
straight-set loss -- 15-10, 15-13 and 16-14.

Pitt, which was originally scheduled to
depart for Connecticut Friday, had its ﬂight
cancelled and didn’t reach Storrs until two
hours before the match.

“We controlled our own destiny in that
match,” said Pitt Head Coach Cindy Alvear.
“If we would have beaten Connecticut in three
straight, we would have entered the tourna-
ment as the third seed, but we just didn’t do
that and ended up losing the mate .”

Freshman Marcia Thiesen was the lone
Lady Panther to notch a double double with
12 kills and 12 digs. Melissa Alpers recorded
nine kills and 10 digs for Pittsburgh, while
junior Tara Haefner chipped in with ﬁve kills
and a team-high 25 assists.

Connecticut was led by the trio of
Annette Rynn, Jenelle Koester and Ann
Roberson. Rynn recorded a double double for
the Lady Huskies with 14 kills and 17 digs.
Koester had 16 kills and seven digs, while
Roberson added eight kills, 13 digs and a
match-high 42 assists.

Pitt rebounded Sunday and raised their

record to 14-12 and 6-5 in the conference,
with a straight-set win over St. John’s —- 15-
13, 15-3 and 15-10.

“St. John’s came out like gangbusters in
the ﬁrst game, but we also came out we 
Alvear said. “We played very well and they
just folded, realizing their season was over.”

It was a balanced effort for Pitt. Jessica
Van Der Mallie and Melissa Alpers each had
nine kills for the Lady Panthers. Van Der
Mallie added ﬁve digs and Alpers added three.

Thiesen contributed seven kills and eight
digs, Stacy Renick notched seven kills and
ﬁve digs and Meinhart added six ldlls and four
digs of her own.

Haefner continued to dominate the assist
category for Pitt with a match-high 27 of the
team’s 41. So far this season, Haefner has 958
assists, an average of 10.19 per game.

Pitt enters the Big East Tournament as
either the fourth or ﬁfth seed, and will face
Syracuse in the ﬁrst round with the winner
moving on to face conference powerhouse
Notre Dame.

“Our goal is like always- to win the con-
ference toinnament and it doesn’t matter who
you play or in what order,” said Alvear.

Alvear has a good feeling going into the

_ tournament despite having such a young
team.

“I honestly think there are only two teams
that can win this toumament- that’s us and
Notre Dame. We are the only team that realis-
tically gave them a good game all season in
the conference,” said Alvear.

Pitt’s biggest mistake of the game
occurred when freshman Michael Shin
threw a bad pass with three seconds
remaining that allowed Holden to nail a
35-foot 'shot at the buzzer to give
Bucknell a 39-37 halftime lead.

The Panthers got a scare at halftime
when 6-foot—4 junior guard Vonteego
Cummings fell ill with the ﬂu. But
Cummings returned and led Pitt to a 22-
5 run in which the Panthers regained the
lead, 58-44.

“I can’t say enough about Vonteego
Cummings,” Willard said. “How he got
through the second half, ‘playing the
way he did is beyond me. That just goes

that electrified the crowd.

Minutes later, Greer dribbled down
the court, then dished the ball to
Hawkins, who delivered a reverse layup
and was fouled. He completed the
three-point play and Pitt seemed to have
the game in hand.

However, Holden and the rest of the
Bucknell squad just wouldn’t give up.

Trailing 66-56, Holden hit a three-
pointer to bring the Bison within seven.
Valter Karavancic added another three
to give Pitt a scare, but a Cummings

first victory of the season.

points, Hawkins with 17, Cummings
with 20 and sophomore Jarrett

and two of Pitt’s top offensive players.

“We’re not trying to be a junior college
program, but we need to ﬁll some irnmedi—
ate need,” said Hanis. T

Talk about special teams has become a
broken record at the weekly press confer-
ence. The talk this time was the Panthers’
botched kickoff coverage, which allowed
Kevin Johnson to return a kickoff 90 yards
for a score and halt Pitt’s momentum after a
Panther touchdown.

“Special teams have been a problem
for us, both because of numbers and incon-
sistency,” Harris acknowledged.
“However, we did hold Spotwood to mini-
mal yardage, and he’s the No. l kick retum-
er in the country.”

9

Harris has already started preparing to
improve special teams for next year noting
that there was a kickolf-specialist recruit at
the Syracuse game.

“We will give a scholarship to a kick-
off specialist. It’s that important to us,” said
Hanis. A,

Harris looked to this week’s tough con-
test against an impressive Virginia Tech
squad. When asked if he thought the loss of
Cornell Brown, who was drafted by the
NFL’s Baltimore Ravens last year, would
be a factor, Harris responded, ‘They don’t
rebuild, they rel .”

, The coach believes that the Panthers
must be consistent to win on Saturday.

“They really shut down Miami except
for a few long runs. Their defense only
gives you certain things, but takes away a
lot of things,” said Harris. 3 -

Quarterback Pete Gonzalez said the
Panthers will try to keep the Hokies off bal-
ance this week, but will need some big
plays.

Gonzalez had a big day himself pass-
ing for 274 yards and two touchdowns, in
addition to leading the fourth-quarter corne-
back

“It makes us realize we can play with
any team in the Big East,” Gonzalez said

ished 10—6 and won a playoff game against
an overrated Detroit team before bowing out
to the Cowboys. -« 9 ,

The Eagles played an easy schedule,
and their success only gave them false hope
that they were truly a good team with Peete
and Watters at the helm. They would later

bring in the 5-foot—10 Ty Detmer, who was

best known for his college play four years
ago, to help the quarterback situation. 1

In that same year, the Steelers lost in the
Super Bowl to the Cowboys. After the loss,
Neil O’Donnell left for the the bright lights
of the 1-15 New York Jets, Kevin Greene
left for Carolina and Barn Morris just took
off + with a couple pounds of ganja.

The Steelers’ basic philosophy is to
draft hard-nosed players for the future. Even
if they have a stud, they will draft a player at
that position. In 1996 they replaced Greene
with Chad Brown, a pro bowler, the injured
Greg Lloyd with speed-rusher Jason Gildon
and eventual quarterback duties went to
Kordell Stewart.

They sign free agents, but they know
the right kind of guys to sign or trade for.
Usually they are proven veterans like
Donnell Woolford, who replaced Rod
Woodson, or someone who just needs a
change of scenery, like tailback Jerome
Bettis who took over for “Smoky” Morris.

It all comes down to this: When the
Eaglesneedsomethingtheygooutandsign
a high-priced superstar like Watters or pay
toomuchforakickerlikeChris “Ican’thit
a 40-yarder” Boniol. The result is a team
without depth, which has caused the NFL’s
worstspecialteamsforthepasttwoyears.

On the other side are the Steelers,
whose economic restraints force them to
always be preparing for the future. And

because of their proven-offensive and defen-‘

sive systems, a younger player; like line-

backer Earl Holmes, can step in and play

well.

It’s a simple theory: Adeep team is bet-
ter than one with a bunch of high—priced
jerks.

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports editor
of The Pitt News.

36:46 earned him 136th place. Right
behind him were freshmen Mike
Orzechowski, in 139th place with 36:50,
and Max Itkin, in 140th place with 36:51.
Freshman Justin Wiley, in just his fourth

cross country race ever, almost caught the

pack. He ﬁnished 147th in 37:19.

“Our lack of upperclassmen hurt us.
For some of these guys right out of high
school, that would be a long training run.
To race that long is tough,” Sobal said.
“The conditions didn’t help. 'I'hat’s a long
time to be out there slipping and sliding
around no matter how you look at it.”

Both teams will receive a short break
before the indoor season ‘begins, when
most of them will run distance races on
the track.

tal relationships, counseling skills, activity programming
and program design‘ to promote positive child and youth
