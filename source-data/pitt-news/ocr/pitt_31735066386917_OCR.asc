Minority retention, enrollment rates increase slightly

By Christine Hanna
Managing Editor

At T hursday’s Board of Trustees meet-
ing, Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
announced that enrollment and retention
rates for black and minority students are
up this year. -

“These rates are still well below the
rates of our white population,” said
O’Connor. But, he said the newly creat-
ed Chancellor’s Diversity Task Force will
help correct these numbers.

According to O’Connor, black under-
graduate enrollment is up from 7.9 per-

 Sigbts of spring?

cent in fall 1992 to 8.5 percent in fall
1993. Minority undergraduate enrollment
is up from 11.2 percent to 12.3 percent.

In fall 1992 there were 3.02 first-year
black students, while in fall 1993 the
number increased to 310, O’Connor said.

O’Connor said the graduation rate of
black, first—ti1ne, full-time, first—year stu-
dents after five years of enrollment went
from 30.5 percent for the fall 1986 enter-
ing class to 46.9 percent for the entering
class in 1987.

The retention rate for the fall 1987
entering class is up to 46.9 percent from
the previous year’s 38.9 percent, said

O’Connor.

According to O’Connor, the graduation
and retention rates are still considerably
lower than those of Pitt’s white students,
whose graduation rate was 61.1 percent
and retention rate was 69.9 percent.

Black and minority graduate and pro-
fessional student enrollments were up as
well. Graduate students are up from 4.1
percent to 4.6 percent, while profession-
al students are up from 6.9 percent to 7.5
percent, he said.

For females, the undergraduate enroll-
ment remains at 50 percent. Female
graduate enrollment is up from 51 per-

He also said the number of total
minority faculty representation has
slightly increased since fall 1992.

for students

By Robin Senor
and Christine Hanna
For The Pitt News

According to a report by the Student
Health Service Committee, a number ol
recommendations have been made by the
committee to keep down the health ser-
vice fees.

One of these recommendations, inte-
grating Student Health Services into
the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, was accepted during the past two
weeks.

- Another, which would require all stu-
dents at the University of Pittsburgh to
have health insurance, was not accepted,
but could be sometime down the road.

The policy would require students who
registered for classes as full time students
to show proof of insurance — or they
would be blocked from registering,
according to the recommendation.

“The last I heard, the policy would not
be mandated,” said Robert G. Houston,
executive assistant at the Office of the
Vice Chancellor at the Office of Student
Affairs. -

BAS provides spiritual
outletfor Pitt students

By Tom Damico
For The Pitt News

Started by the university nine
years ago, the University Child
Development Center is 21 Valu-
able asset to parents in the Pitt
community.

The program is designed to
provide all students, faculty and
staff of the university with quali-
ty care for their children while
the parents are working or
attending classes, according to
Director of the UCDC Sherry
Cleary.

“We don’t value child-
hood/parenthood in America.
Many European countries have

socialized child care for work-
ing parents,” Cleary said.

Since many children can’t
be at home with their parents,
daycare should be “the
second best place to be,” she
said.

The UCDC is located in
Bellefield Hall and consists of

eight classrooms for infants as’

young as six weeks, toddlers
and preschoolers.

In the fall of 1993, a kinder-
garten class was implemented
into the program for 5 and 6
year olds. There is also an
evening program that runs until
9 p.m. which can benefit CGS
students.

According to Cleary, there are
currently 25 full-time teachers
and assistant teachers, all of
whom have many years of
experience and at least a bache-
lor’s degree in many areas deal-
ing with child care and educa-
tion.

Also, there are several part-
time aides and student assistants
who work at the center. “The
biggest asset of the program is
the staff,” said Cleary.

The program is very flex-
ible regarding the parent’s
needs as well as the child’s
needs. The cost can be
based on a monthly fee for

In praise and celebration of
God, the Black Action Society
danced, read and sang as part
of their second annual Gospel
Night at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The music started early
when the audience sang the
“Black National Anthem” with
the lyrics “Let our rejoicing
rise  let it resound  let us
march on.”

“We want to fill your heart

and ears with the gospel of
the Lord,” said Pitt student
Felicia Gardner.“If you want
to clap your hands, clap ‘em.
If you want to tap your feet,
tap ‘em,” she said. “Whatever
you feel like doing, do it.”

“This isn’t just a talent show,
it’s a spiritual expression,” said
Master of Ceremonies Noel
Harris. He then led a prayer
while the audience clasped
hands.

Students learn uncommon languages through LAI

By]. M. Gonzalez

For The Pitt News

Pitt’s language opportunities extend
beyond the languages most students take.

French, Spanish, Italian and Gemian are
among the commonly taught languages, yet
some uncommon languages are available to
students through the Language Acquisition
Institute.

The institute offers the Uncommonly
Taught Languages Program. Students can
request a language that is not currently
taught, provided that a native speaker can
be found to teach it.

According to Robert Henderson, director
of LAI, a native speaker can relate personal
knowledge from their country. The small
classes allow students to receive individual
attention from a native speaker rather than

9 reading about the country’s language in a

textbook, he said.

LAI was established in 1970. It was
designed to bring less commonly taught
languages and their cultures to the interests
of students.

Edward Anthony said he helped start the
institute because “Pitt was interested in the
international dimension.” He said he

believes that it makes people “aware of the
cultural, linguistic strands of our country.”

LAI tries to bring in languages unavailable
elsewhere to students. Some of the lan-
guages popular now are Arabic, Irish
Gaelic, Korean and Swahili.

Pitt senior Chris Callahan, who is taking
Thai, said he believes that “the school
should be focusing on broadening classes if
we are entering an international market.”

Reeny Davison, the Dutch instructor,
agrees on expanding language education.
“The world is a lot broader than French,
Spanish and German.”

According to the “Pittsburgh Plan for the
Study of the Uncommonly Taught
Languages,” Anthony wrote that “the faculty
recommended that  the university should
be strongly urged to strengthen its program
in the less commonly taught languages 

When the institute was founded, any stu-
dent could request a language, but
“because of budgetary constraints, ideal sit-
uations must remain destinations,” accord-
ing to Anthony.

Anthony suggested the university should
provide more funds to LAI. Although this is
difficult, universities “must acknowledge
their students and to provide linguistic tools

for research,” he said.

According to Henderson, the most com-
mon reasons students enroll in uncommon-
ly taught languages are for personal inter-
est, for communication with family mem-
bers that speak the language, to prepare for
a foreign exchange program or for research
in areas of political science,. Religious
Studies, business or archaeology.

The largest enrollment is in American
Sign Language. The majority of the students
taking it are interested in interpretation and
deaf education.

Sophomore Maureen Fox said she is
studying Irish “to bring it back into the fam-
ily” because her grandparents spoke it.

Senior John Connolly said he studies Irish
for family reasons as well. “All my family
still speaks it.”

According to Kevin McLauglin, the
instructor for Irish Gaelic, there is also
another reason so many are taking Irish. He
said, “Interest in Irish is growing because it
is becoming recognized in the Irish commu-
nity. It is officially recognized as a minor
language in the Common Market.”

When asked how she liked taking
Swahili, sophomore Chris Hilton said it is

“Righteousness, peace and joy in the holi-
ness. Don’t you want to be part of the
Kingdom? Come on everybody!”

Immediately after Bethea, Jayson
Williams performed a monologue from
August Wilson’s Fences. The scene
showed a son’s frustration from growing
up in the shadow of an overbearing
father.

With clenched fists and uplifted face,
Randi Reynolds did a ballet to “Don’t Cry
for Me” by Whitney Houston.

Harold Brown read a piece of poetry
entitled, “Hope for a Lost Nation.” The
poem said the nation’s “hope” lies with a
faith in God and reading the Bible.

After Brown had everyone stand and
say “Praise the Lord,” he said this year’s
Gospel Night seemed more spiritual than
the one last year.

“The last Gospel Night, I didn’t hear the
Lord’s name at all,” he said, “but that’s all
I’m hearing tonight.”

“Let the church  usher the spirit of the

Lord,” Harris said. “Don’t be ashamed to
tell people that you are Christian, that you
go to church, that you believe in the
Lord.”

Dressed all in white, Renee Pope and
Duane Pettus danced to “Face to Face.“
They slowly rose from the ﬂoor, pointing
their amis to the sky. In the middle of the
song, several audience members leaped
onto the stage and began jumping and
hugging the dancers and each other. Pope
and Pettus finished the dance while those
who came on stage stood silently in the
background.

Tanita Harris and Laquanda Smack,
another duet, danced to a soul version of
“Bridge over Troubled Waters.” Dressed in
black, the two women mixed slow move-
ments with faster spins and gestures and
ended their performance kneeling, arms
crossed over their hearts. Harris and
Smack later joined three other women
from the Black Dance Workshop to per-
form a slow, rhythmic dance while the
words “sweet moments” chanted in the

Students who didn’t carry
health insurance would end up
paying money aside from tuition
to purchase a minimum health
insurance.

“Right now, health care
is expensive. We tried to pro-
vide at least a minimum for
an affordable price. Thoughts
were for better, extensive, more
comprehensive coverage,” he
said.

Mark Smith, student advocate

he supports any policy that

The black-and-white

played, the two mimed a

God is real. They received

fun. Her language study will
help her in missionary work in
Tanzania and Kenya.

Her professor, Rashidi
Kabogota, agreed. He said he
believes that learning Swahili is
“easier than English because,
linguistically, it is more logical."
He said the language is easier to
analyze in pronunciation and
phonetics, but that the grammar
is very different from English.

“For example, in an English
sentence, the verb is stressed
[while] in Swahili the noun is
more important,” he said. He
explained that there are eight
different ways of saying an
object, and that you can change
the noun’s beginning for syntax
reasons like number agreement.

Most of Kabogota’s students
are African Americans taking
Swahili for personal interests.
Others are taking it for their
majors such as linguistics or
anthropology.

Although some students take
an uncommon language to try
something different, more than
half continue in the language
for four terms because they are
interested in speaking and
learning a particular language.

Anthony said he believes that
“there is more of the world than
Europe." Language can cross
communication barriers within
a family or open relations with
other countries, he said.

Space race not overyet

The nation’s space program has come under increas-
ing attack from those who argue that the money would
be better spent elsewhere. Some argue that the money
would be better spent at home, on Earth, and that all
of these ventures are merely “pie in the sky” attempts
at pipe dreams.

However, with the world moving ahead at a rapid
pace, it is time to look beyond the confines of the
planet. The space program is a necessary endeavor for
many reasons, not all of them scientific.

The most important reasons are scientific. As humans
attempt to survive the hostile environment of space,
hidden benefits come which help all of humanity. Most
of the technology which has come to help the handi—
capped, most notably the blind, has come from the
space program. These technological advances will also
help America retain its competitive edge in the world
of science. _

The knowledge that is to be gained about the uni-
verse by further exploration is invaluable.,It is impor-
tant to know about the universe as a whole in order to
understand very important areas of science such as
physics.

Launching" rockets and space probes is better than
launching missiles. Attempting to explore and develop
the resources outside of the Earth provide an outlet for
much of the military technology developed during the
Cold War. However, instead of using such technology
as a tool of mass destruction, it can be used to better
our lot on the planet. 1

The scientists who might otherwise peddle their
knowledge to third—world despots, who want such
weapons to use in conﬂicts with their neighbors, could
be better employed in space explorationefforts.

The United States is considering joint projects with
the former Soviet republics. This will increase the influ-
ence of the United States in a region that is becoming
increasingly important, and at the same time, increas-
ingly unstable. This is an opportunity that the country
cannot afford to miss out on. The former Soviet Union
was making great strides in important areas such as
heavy lift boosters, whichallow for the construction of
space stations and the like. By working with the for-
mer Soviets, not only can the United States raise its
clout, but it can also save money in its own space pro-
gram. With complaints about the increasing costs, a
method of cutting costs while gaining benefits should
appeal to all.

Looking to history, it was not so long ago that
President Kennedy mobilized the nation with the goal
of putting a man on the moon. With clear goals such
as a manned space station, returning to the moon and
even a possible mission to Mars, the nation can once
again regain some national focus and ‘resume its place
as a leader on the Earth and beyond.

President Clinton claimed that one of his great-
est accomplishments in his first year in office
was the passage of the Brady Bill. According to
the polls, the majority of people agree with this
piece of legislation, but doubt its effectiveness in
curbing crime.

Supporters argue that the Brady Bill‘ will
reduce the number of deaths by guns. There is’
no doubt that this country must do something to
lower the number of murders by handguns. In
1990 alone there were 10,567 murders by hand-

people last year on the New York City subway.
He bought his gun LEGALLY in California, a
state that has a 15-day waiting period — three
times that of the Brady Bill.

There is no legislation whatsoever that can
stop people like that from getting a gun. It is
only through harsh prison sentences that society
can keep gun toting prisoners off the nation's
streets.

Gun control is a bandage for a society that is

hemorrhaging from all of its arteries.

guns in the United States (“NBC
Nightly News” 10/7/95). The
Brady Bill, however-, is not the
answer.

On “This Week with David
Brinkley,” George Will pointed
out a number: of important facts.

Tony
Dickensheets

It does absolutely notliingfgto
-take the weapons o‘ut"of"the
hands of the scum that commit
the crimes.

Criminals don’t buy
weapons in gun shops, and they
are smart enough to know that

With 200 million guns already cir-.
culating in the United States, there is a gun for
anybody who wants to purchase one —— legally
or illegally.

Furthermore, there are already 100,000 gun
control laws in this country, and the murder rate
continues to increase.

I am not a member of the National Rifle
Association and in fact, I support the Brady Bill,
but we must realize that it is legislation of sym-
bolism, not substance.

_ It is an indisputable fact that the only people
who will register and buy their weapons legally
are law—abiding citizens.

The criminals will continue to buy their
weapons the same way that they’ve always done
it — on the street corners or in the back alleys
of cities and towns.

As George Will has also pointed out, 95 per-
cent of all crimes which are committed with
guns in this country are done with illegally-
bought weapons.

Gun control is a re-election strategy used by
politicians to play on the emotions of the public.
It is a feel-good strategy that does little, if any-
thing, to reduce crime.

A case in point is the wacko who killed six

- good common sense. '

weapons charges are the first to
be dropped in plea bargains. We must make
people pay for committing crimes with weapons,
not take guns away from law-abiding, tax—paying
citizens. ,

The soaring crime rate in America is not a gun
problem, it is a criminal “justice system” prob-
lem.

We must attack the crime epidemic at its core
through harsh deterrents such as mandatory life
sentences for repeat offenders and the death
penalty for murderers and other violent offend-
ers.

Gun control is a liberal attempt at a quick fix
that blames the weapons instead of the people
who are pulling the triggers.

People ,not guns, are committing crimes and
murders, and they should be held accountable
and responsible for their actions.

Until this nation can guarantee the people that
the criminals will have their weapons taken
away, there is no way that law-abiding citizens
should, or will, give up their weapons.

The Second Amendment aside, this is just

With 7:56 remaining in Saturday after-
noon’s Pitt-Villanova basketball game at
Fitzgerald Field House, Wildcat center Jason
Lawson fouled out. Power forward Ron
Wilson followed five minutes later with his
fifth foul.

Villanova turned

to 6-foot-7-inch, 210

pound swing man Eric

Eberz to play center

against Pitt’s 6-11, 256-

pound Eric Mobley,

who already had 26

points in the contest, with the other four
Wildcats on the floor all being guards.

“It was a serious gut check,” Villanova
head coach Steve Lappas said. “Five small
kids like that having to go to the glass. They
all had to do it together.”

The 12-9 ‘Cats (8-6 in the conference)
checked out well enough to pull out a 93-
88 victory in double overtime and deal
another blow to the fading NCAA tourna-
ment hopes of the Panthers (13-10, 7-8).

“I think we probably have to win the
tournament in New York,” Pitt head coach
Paul Evans said after his team’s fourth
straight loss in Fitzgerald Field House.

Villanova actually dominated the early
part of the game, running out to an 18-4
bulge six minutes in on a three-pointer by
Kerry Kittles.

Kittles sizzled in the first half, scoring 17
of his team-high 29 "points in the opening
stanza.

Pitt slowly pulled closer as the half went
on, pulling within five just before the break
on a bucket by Orlando Antigua.

The Panthers continued to charge in the
second half with a strong inside game.
Mobley converted a three-point play, then

Last Sunday at Seton Hall University, the Pitt women’s
basketball team lost as the game-tying free throw
rimmed out.

Wednesday at Fitzgerald Field House, it was a shot in
the final seconds of overtime by Villanova that sent the
Lady Panthers to their second defeat in a row, their first
consecutive losses of the season.

“Any time you lose a close one, it’s a heartbreaker,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said.

Yesterday in Storrs, Conn, there was no last-second
heart breaking. There was no need as the fourth-ranked
Huskies (22—2, 15-1 in the Big East) smothered the Lady
Panthers (17—7, 11-5) in an 85-59 pounding.

Connecticut rode its devastating inside game as it did
in beating Pitt earlier this season at Fitzgerald Field
House. The low-post trio of forward Jamelle Elliot and
centers Rebecca Lobo and Kara Wolters, who combined
for 51 points the first time around, chimed in with 42
this time. 6

Shooting guard Jennifer Rizzotti, who was relatively
quiet in Pittsburgh, tied Lobo for the team high with 16
points including four three-point shots in six attempts.
The once-potent Lady Panther long—range game contin-
ued its recent struggles, as they hit only three of 13
from beyond the three-point arc in the contest.

The Huskies did not miss much from anywhere, hit-
ting 27-of-51 field goal attempts (55 percent). Pitt took
67 shots, 16 more than UConn, but hit one fewer for a

his only points of the game, a dunk on the
fast break, to give Pitt 21 51-40 margin.

The Panthers held a sizable edge most of McCullough with 1:44 remaining.

‘Nova forward Eric Eberyz scored 22 points as small Wildcat line-up held Pitt front-line in check

59 percent shooting game.

The Huskies controlled the glass, grabbing 45
rebounds compared to Pins 32. Lobo led the way with
11 rebounds to go along with four blocks.

Connecticut also had a wide margin in free throws,
going to the line 33 times (hitting 22) while‘Pitt only
attempted 10 free throws (draining four). This also led
to the Lady Panthers’ foul trouble. Forward Jonna
Huemrich and point guard Carol Morton were both
gone with five fouls before the game ended.

The fouling started early for Pitt, as Huemrich got her
first only 21 seconds into the game. Her second fol-
lowed with 11:10 remaining in the first half. By then Pitt
was within one at 14-13 and Huemrich had six points.

Connecticut slowly pulled away as the half pro-
gressed, but Pitt managed to pull within six at 28-22 as

Jenine Joyce scored with a runner on the baseline.

Then the Huskies blew it open.

Elliot responded to Joyce’s bucket with a three-point-
er, only her sixth of the season, with 6:08 left. Two min-
utes later, Huemrich picked up her third foul and Lobo
hit one of two free throws to give Connecticut a 37-24
bulge.

Lobo’s 18-footer stretched the edge to 41-24 before
Pitt forward Jill Colabrese ended the 15-2 run with a
three pointer to pull the lady Panthers within 41-27. Pitt
went to the locker room down 46-27 despite 12 points
by Huemrich.

Huemrich finished with a total of 18 points. The
Huskies extended the lead to as many as 34 when

The Pitt women’s tennis team
hosted their invitational this
weekend taking 11 wins —— a
team record since the invitation-
al was started four years ago.

The Fourth Annual 1994
University of Pittsburgh
Women’s Tennis Invitational
took place last Friday, Saturday
and Sunday.

Pitt hosted seven teams and
the competition consisted of
single and double play with six
single flights and three double
flights.

The singles flight A champi-
onship was taken by Santi
Nalluri of Youngstown State
University.

Pitt’s Alison Baker won the
flight A consolation singles
championship. Baker defeated
Carey Sisko of Duquesne in the
final round 5-7, 6—3, 6-2.

Head coach George
Dieffenbach said that Baker had
a terrific tournament.

“She beat two players that
beat her during the season in
dual matches,” Dieffenbach
said.

Dieffenbach was also pleased
that Bakers performance
became a lot more offense-ori-
ented, playing the net more
than usual.

In flight B, Pitt"s Marla
Zielinski won her first round
against Kristen Blayney of
Cleveland State University.
However, she lost in the next
round to the University of
Akron’s Colleen Hollowell.

Hillary Gordon of Pitt com-
peted in the Flight E singles
despite illness. Gordon lost her
first round but went on to
defeat Natalie Fate of Akron
University in the semifinals with
6-2, 6-5.

Caren Lincow competed for
Pitt in the flight F singles, win-
ning the consolation champi-
onship. Lincow played Amy
Protzman of Marshall University
in the final round winning 4-6,
6-4, 7-5.

“I went out there and gave it
my best today and Ifelt like a
great player,” Lincow said.

“Caren really progressed a lot
and raised her game at least a
level this weekend,”
Dieffenbach said.

flight A was won by a pair from
Akron.

Playing for Pitt, Baker and
Zielinski won their first round in
the flight A doubles.

"They opened up the tourna-
ment setting the tone or the
weekend by beating
Duquesne’s No. 1 team which
beat them earlier in the season,”
Dieffenbach said. “It was a good
confidence booster. They
showed that they could play
against a quality team and be
victorious.

The duo of Andrea Passarello
and Lincow played for Pitt in
the Flight C doubles. They won
the consolation championship
round by a Colgate University
default.

“I was confident that they
were going to do well in that
final anyway," Dieffenbach said.
“They performed well as a team
—- attacked more and returned
serve better."

Although the invitational was
under individual competition
format, there was evidence that
the Pitt team benefitted as a
whole.

Dieffenbach said that it was
promising to see depth in his
team. He also said that the
Invitational gives his team the
advantage of solid competition
early in the season without trav-
elling.

“It really helps to become
tournament tough early in
February,” Dieffenbach said.

According to Dieffenbach, the
team has been practicing hard
since early January, He felt that
his team was ready for the com-
petition.

“I would have been very
pleased with 10 individual vic-
tories, singles or doubles, from
my players,” Dieffenbach said.
“I got 11 —— so I’m real happy
with how my team performed.”

Forehands and Backhands:
The Pitt men’s tennis team also
hosted their annual invitational

_ one week before the women’s

team. The team achieved 12
wins and Pitt’s Doherty took
second place in the singles’
championship.

Wildcat rookie Alvin
Williams answered with a
driving shot and a three-
pointer to cut the edge to
four with just over a
minute left.

“He found it at the
end,” Lappas said of the
reserve guard. “He had a
clutch, gutty performance
for a young kid.”

With Mobley on the
bench most of the last
three minutes, the
Panthers did not score a
field goal in regulation
after McCullough’s trey.
The Wildcats pulled with-
in two as Gant fouled
Roscoe Harris on a three-
point attempt and the

three shots.

Kerry Kittles tied the game
with an inside bucket, leaving
Pitt seven seconds to win it.
With Mobley still on the side-
lines, McCullough tried to drive
for a score, but went down
before he could get a shot off.

“I got tripped up and the refs .

didn’t call it,” McCullough said.
“I don’t think players just come
down and ﬂop to the ﬂoor.”

Mobley said that he was frus-
trated by having to watch those
final minutes of regulation from
the sideline.

“He couldn’t defend any-
body,” Evans said. “That’s not
anything negative to Eric, he
just can’t guard a player 22 feet
away from the basket.”

Mobley was back in at the
beginning of overtime. Pitt lost
the ball as Eberz forced Mobley
too close to the backboard on
an attempted alley-oop, but
Gant tipped it loose and
McCullough grabbed it and
found Mobley alone for the
slain.

The basket was one of only
two Mobley scored after the
Wildcats went to their smaller
lineup. The Villanova double-
teams continued to force the big
man to pass the ball back out-
side.

‘‘I don’t think we really took
advantage of the [Villanova] big
men fouling out,” McCullough
said. “Maybe our [power for-
wards] should have stepped
up.”

Gant did that with a bucket
inside that gave Pitt a four—point
edge with 1:47 left in the first
overtime, but Pitt did not score
the rest of the period.

Things got tougher when
Gant fouled out a minute later.
Willie Cauley did not play after
the first half, but Evans said that
the matchups were only part of
the reason.

“He just hasn’t been ready to
play,” Evans said.

Eberz hit one free throw on
the Gant foul to pull the
Wildcats within one, then Pitt
had a chance to run some clock.
Orlando Antigua fired up a
three-pointer with 19 seconds
left and missed.

Mobley grabbed the rebound,
but Wildcat point guard
Jonathan Haynes picked his
pocket and fired to Harris up
the floor. McCullough fouled
Harris to take away the lay-in,
and the Villanova guard hit one
of two shots to tie the contest at
81.

“We were supposed to get a
better shot,” McCullough said of
Antigua’s attempt. “We were
supposed to reset. Orlando felt
he was open and he would
make the shot. If he’d have
made it, it would have been one
of the greatest shots of his
career.”

Pitt had the ball and 19 sec-
onds remaining but did not get
a shot off.

Mobley gave Pitt an 83-81
margin as the second overtime
began, but the Wildcats took
advantage of the center from
there.

Eberz shook loose from
Mobley for a three-pointer
which Haynes followed with a

 

Chris Gant (40): a rebounding machine.

throws.

“You’ve got to make the foul
shots,” Evans said. “The big
ones, we didn’t make. We went
50 percent or less down the
stretch.”

Eberz drove by Mobley on the
baseline, hit a short leaner and
drew a foul on Antigua. He
made the foul shot, giving
Villanova an 89-83 lead with
1:23 left.
