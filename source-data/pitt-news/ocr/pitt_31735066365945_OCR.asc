Emergency Moratorium
held in Market Square

by SUE McDEVITT

Despite the morning rain, about
400 people turned out for the
noon rally in Market Square,
Thursday, May 4th. The rally
commemorated the second anni-
versary of the killings at Kent
State.

Msgr. Charles Rice acted as mod-
erator of the program which in-
cluded people from a wide divers-
ity of causes speaking on" the
range of problems afflicting Amer-
ca.

TheGodshall Four-Forty All-
American‘ Band played Kentucky
Mountain music to the crowd, a
cross-section of the city.

Sixty anti-war protestors who
xmarched from Carnegie-Mellon
University, housewives and chil-
dren, many businessmen, the me-
dia, a few old people and the po-
litical- left of Pittsburgh who
plan and presentmost rallys and
moratoriums made up the crowd.

Mgsr. Rice introduced the first-
speaker, Bob Linday of the Pitts-
burgh Chapter of Vietnam Veter-
ans against the ‘war, who spolie
on The American Dream. .'

“It used to be,” he said, “that

America meant Mom and apple
pie, baseball on Sundays, harn-
burgers and a nine-to-five job.

“But where,” he asked, “do we

find America today? We find it
a country where the poor still go
hungry and the rich live by the
law of loopholes.” Linday, who
talked about the war and those
who are called traitors for not
Supporting it, ended by saying.
“Everyone who continues to sup-
port the war is a traitor to this
country.”

The next speaker was Clifton
Caldwell, international vi.ce-presi-
dent of the Amalgamated Meat-
cutters and Butcher Workers of
North America AFL-CIO.

Caldwell, a middle-aged man
withhgraying-white short hair.

Maintained that the war" is al-
most over and cited as evidence
the recent positions taken by
Howard K. Smith and William
F. Buckley, Jr., advising com-
plete withdrawal. “When those

two advise getting out, perhaps
we will,” Caldwell said.

-Speaking of Vietnamization he
said, “The ‘South Vietnamese can’t -
fight, because they don’t want to
fight.” ’

He concluded by analyzlflg the
relationship of the Presldents
aide, Henry Kissinger, to North
Vietnam’s Lei ‘Due Thou. He
stated htat Kissinger trusts L91
Duc Thou and Lei Ducv Thpu
trusts Kiissinge“ “NOW, he Sa_1d9
“if the other man in the Whlte
House will let Henry _Kissinger
do his thing the war will end.”

Ruspresentﬁtives from various
groups, including the Third_World,
spoke of the war as g€110¢'de and
gouted a Vietnamese poet,.“Wl10
will be left to celebrate this vic-
tory of blood and tears?”

Jean Jones, activist in the Wel-
fare Rights movement, talked of
the Presidents notable lapses In
promoting the development of
Day-Care Centers and in remod-
eling the welfare system.

Alice Farentia, fiery, tough
member of the Farmworkers Un-
ion, said “We are gonna boycott *-
lettuce until we get this through
and the hell with Nixon.”

Leonard Rodberg, tall, beard-
ed assistant to Senator Gravel of
Pentagon Paper fame s_aid “for
twenty-five years this has been a
president’s war, not a peop_le’s.

Modiﬁed Forbes plan announced

MoFADDEN‘, People oriented solution.

The people have never been con-
sulted.” He concluded by saying,
“This is the time and it is up to
us.”

Councilman John P. Lynch, who
had never taken a stand on the
war, detailed his protest in two
points: “One, the war is immoral,
inhuman and pointless. Two, it
isn’t working. It leads to nothing
but the death of our boys and
Asian boys.’ '

David Montgomery, Labor his-
torian at Pitt, concluded the rally
saying, “The people of South Vi-
etnam are fed up of fighting for
the Yankee dollar.” Nixon, he
said, claims’ that we have to
prove we are number 1. “This is
the dream of a madman. This
madman’s dream has only one re-'
sult. Every day it kills more and
more Vietnamese.”

“But ,the society it is blowing
up is not Vietnamese society. It is
ours. Nobodywants this goddamn
war.” Montgomery called for the
formation of a new coalition with
one demand, withdrawal from Vi-
etnam now.

A general University/ City/ Com-
munity meeting will be held on
Thursday to discuss the Report
of the Task Force charged with
formulating planning and~‘devel-
opment guidelines and a m'6di-
fied Forbes Phase I plan.

The purpose of the Task force,

is to impliment a joint planning

process concerned with physical“,

development in Oakland.

The Department of City Plan-
ning'has suggested a modifica-
tion of the Forbes Development
plans which would relieve traffic
congestion and conserve land.

The City Planning proposal
suggests that Sennott Street be-
tween Bigelow and Bouquet be
closed and relocated approximate-
ly 340 feet to the south thus con-
necting.Schenley Plaza and Ban-
quet Streets.

SC holds first spring meeting a

The first Student'Government
Board meeting of the term, held
last week, consisted mainly of re-
vues of allocations to various stu-
dent organizations.

The board passed a $756.03
emergency allocation to the Po-
laris $681-03 went towards wip-
ing out deficits accrued by last
year’s staff, $25 for advertising,
and $50 for printing up descrip-
tions of the publication for the
purpose of obtaining advertising.
Jeff Pasek, business manager of
the Polaris, stated that this allo-
cation was necessary to enable
the new staff to begin with a
zero balance.

Members of the Owl staff, rep-
resented by Lisa Kronenfeld, re-
quested that the Board review
the decision. by the Allocations
Committee concerning their budg-
et. The Committee had recom-
mended that the price of the year-
book be raised from $5 to ‘$5.25
for non-seniors and from‘ $3 to
$3.50 for seniors to avoid an an-
ticipated deficit at the end of
next year. The Owl staff oppos-

 

es this plan, saying that --the in-
crease would discourage students
from buying the book and cause
problems in handling money. The
Board voted to send the issue back
to Allocations for a new rationale
of their budget cut.

Also reviewed was the alloca-
tion to the Nursing Student Or-
ganization. The organization was
reque§?'Ing money to send two of
its members to a workshop spon-
sored by the National Student
Nurses Association and had only
been granted enouah for one to
go. After some discussion, it was
decided to postpone any decision
until the organization could rep-
resent itself.

The allocation to the College

Young Democrats was accepted by

both groups at $312.90.

In further action the Board ac-
cepted John Black as a new mem-
be rof the Allocations Committee.

The law firm of Fridman,
Friedman, and Weisman was elec-
ted to represent students, retro-
active to April 7th. Five at-
torneys will be available, on a re-
tainer basis at $300/month, for

 

services through the Legal Aware-
ness Committee and the Tenants
Union.

In an effort to present movies

to students as inexpensively as
possible, the Board requested that
the Franklin Pangborn Film Club
set $.50 as the top price for their
films. Suggestions were also made
that the club sell tickets in ad-
vance and sell a season packet of
about 15 tickets at a reduced rate.
It was noted that this would be
a convenience for commuters and_
guests. Pangborn agreed to insti-
tute these suggestions for a term
on a trial basis. ‘

 

Due .to a breakdown in our
computerized printing process, the
Pitt News has not followed it's

regular publication

schedule this week.

 

 

Pennant Place would also be
closed._

Dan McFadden, Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs,
stated that this by pass of the
proposed Forbes complex would
eliminate conflicts between pedes-
trian and vehicular traffic.

Persons walking from the Ca-
thedral of Learning to the new
Forbes Complex would have to
_cross at least three streets, caus-
ing a great deal of traffic con-
gestion between classes.

The by pass would take vehicle
traffic off of Bigelow,' Forbes
and Sennott.

“This is a people oriented so-
lution in that it allows people to
guse these streets “McFadden
said.

The street closings will create
13 acre plaza stretching from
Oakland Avenue to Carnegie Mu-
seum. .

The Schenley Plaza parking lot '

will be moved underground and a
landscaped plaza will take its
place, according to the City's pro-
nosal. ‘

has also suggested trading the

‘ Because of these orders, all

'lhis letter concerned negotia-
tions for a contract under which
Curnow, Band Director of Gen-
esee Community College, Flint
Michigan, would arrange Pitt
Band music for a price, then re-
sell the arrangements to high
schools, ,in alleged violation of
ASCAP rules for the sale of mus-

Williams had previously de-
nied any knowledge of an outside
arranger to the Pitt News.
Schlotter further feels that Dr.
Snow has been embarrassed by
this
exposure of his protege’s dupli-
city. _
“Dr. Snow is~doing all of this

as a smokescreen to cover up the‘

embarrassment of having this
letter publicized,” Schlotter said.-

Schlotter also admitted that he
was the one that found Cumow’s
letter. He explained that he came
across the letter by accident when
he went into a supply cabinet for
tape.

The.letter was lying on top of
many personal letters addressed
to Williams and he picked it
up and read it. He felt that this
was proof against Williams’ pre-

-vious denial of an outside arrang-

er, 'and made copies of the let-
ter. . ,

Bandfraternity upset over

Schlotter pointed out that Band
members have been fighting the
situation created by Williams for
months now.

In a report to the Chancellor
concerning the Wind Ensemble
Concert which was held recently,
Mr. Williams was criticized. for
allegedly recruiting members of
the Pitt faculty, Carnegie Mellon
student musicians, and students
from North Hills High School to
play to enlarge the size of the
group because of the excessive
number of bandmen quitting. The
members, according to Schlotter,
lost confidence in Williams’ con-
ducting ability. The Concert Band
was usually made up of about 90

players,-but this years’Wind En-

semble numbers about twenty
ﬁve.

According to Snow, Schlotter’s‘

account of what took place with the
mail situationrfs “totally untrue.”-

“I made a request three months
ago to the University’ Mail Serv-
ice asking them to deliver all of
Mr. Williams’ mail to his office
in the Music Building,” he ex-
plained, “This is more efficient
than for him (Williams) to run
to the mailroom to get it.”

Snow denies that this request
had anything to do with the let-
ter that was found by Schlotter. He

also feels that the Band fratemi- '

ty’s mail was rerouted because

The Dean of Student Affairs’
Disappearing Task Force on Re-
muneration to Student Leaders
lciﬁld its first meeting last Fri-

y.

Dean of Student Affairs Alfred
Moye explained that the purpose
of the group is to “Classify posi-
tions which require a great deal
of time and therefore discrimin-
ate against poor students,” who
cannot participate in programs
because of the necessity for part
time employment.

Moyepstated, “I am not against
salary payments because I feel
that meaningful jobs are being
done by students which should be
salaried.” The Task Force, ac-
cording to Moye, must determine
the nature and source of. remun-
eration.

In deciding which activities mer-

it remuneration the Task Force
must also distinguish between
“interest groups” and “universi-
ty wide services,” the Dean said.

Moye told the Task Force that
he has a survey which indicates
that most schools compensate
members of their Student Govem-
ments and student newspapers.

The Task Force can decide that
such remunerations are not feasi-
LE. However, their recommen-
dation can only be used to argue
against using the student activity
fee as a source of remuneration,
as some organizations operate as
a business or have other sources
of income. .

Moye explained that the term
Disappearing Task Force” Iden-
tifies the group as a one shot
study group,” contrasting it with

the Student Affairs Task Force

 

 

Task Force studies stlident Salaries

which has become a standing com-
mittee.

The Office of Student Affairs is
also preparing a position paper on
student activity fees and how they
can be liegitimized.

Moye feels that “we must have
an activity fee to support student
activities.” He characterized the
fee at Pitt as “rock bottom,” cit-
ing schools where an activity fee

of about $100 are paid by students.

Several members of the Students for a Democratic Society
have been arrested by the Campus Police and sent before a
grand jury by a city magistrate for hanging posters on the Cathe-
dral of Learning advocating that students protest “University
war complicity,” ROTC, and the Vietnam war.

" Some students have questioned the action of the University
in this matter, charging that a double standard of justice exists.

4 While it may be beneficial th-at the Universit judges cases
of student violations individually rather than fol owing a rigid
policy, we question the judgement of the University in treating
marijuanna smoking as a counseling problem and poster hang-
ing as an offense meriting action by municipal courts. ‘ I
 Last Fall several students were arrested for smoking mari-
juana in a Towers room. The students, however, had the arrest
expuin-ged from their record, and their case was tried through
the University system and treated a's"'"a “counseling problem.” .
_ — The PITT NEWS felt at that time, and still feels that the
problem was handled correctly.-
~ , ~ However, we cannot. see why such serious action has been
taken -against students for such a minor infraction of University
rules as hanginga poster on the Cathedral.
-;  The posters were des-igned to wash off with water, causing
little problem with removal. Therefore, the offense cannot be
considered vandalism.

    
   
  
   
  
   
 

 
    
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
    
   
 
 
   
    
   
  

action has been taken after the arrest.

' Campus judlicial Officer, Alden Bowen, stated that the de-
cision to take the students before a grand jury -was m-ade by the
city magistrate on the basis of facts presented by the arresting
 officer and that the Campus Police were forced to take the ‘sus-
peots to thecity «authorities because -there was some doubt as to
heir stud'en.t status at the time of the arrest.

It seems that he nature of the offense did not warrant im-

layed while the status of the people involved was confirmed.
 These students are now faced with a ériminal record and
_have been put to_a great deal of inconvenience.
L ' if The only feasable solution is to drop the charges as soon
 possible and handle the matter through the University judicial

Injustice seen

Editor,

It has long been argued by
Black leaders that a duel system
of justice exists in the United
States, where black and white
skins are unequal before the law.
This is particularly true in the
front lines of justice, where the
law meets the people, that is,
the police, Whites as a whole
have been slow to accept this
claim, however, in recent years,
more and more whites have
grown to accept it too..

The recent arrest by campus
police of three SDS members for
posting signs on campus build-,
ings adds a new dimension to this

inequality. That is, the cate- 2

gory of political dissenters. There
are several factors which high-»
light--the unequal and repressive
attitude of the Pitt campus in this
matter..

According to Campus Judicial
Ofﬁcer Bowen, (Pitt News May
4), the arresting officer did not
know what the content of the
posters was, nor did he know that
the accused were members of the’
SDS. This is ridiculous; the post-
er, reproduced in the same is-
sue, clearly identifies the spon-
soring organization as the SDS.
If the arresting officer did not
read the sign before making an
arrest, then that officer can only
be classified as an ass. _

Secondly, Bowen/’s rationale
for not dropping charges is also
phoney. He argues that if charges
phoney. He argues that if charges
are dropped then the arresting
officer can be charged with false
arrest. If Bowen is so naive as to
assume this point, "then one must
ask why someone who is so un-
aware of judicial reality holds
the position of campus judicial
officer. Charges .are made and
dropped every day in Magistrate
Court; all it takes to drop charg-
es is to ask_that those who are
charged not to prosecute in re-
turn. Perhaps the term ass might
apply to Bowen too.

The real question is, why are
these people being -singled out
as an example when violations of
these rules occur every day _by
other campus politicaland social
groups? The answer lies in the
attitude of the police toward" poli-
tical dissenters. I recount below
two personal experiences of the
last week that serve as further ex-
amples of this repressive attitude.-

Last Saturday, I entered the
Monroeville Mall shopping cen-
ter to distribute handbills pub-
licizing the May fourth anti-war
moratorium (this was unrelated
to the SDS project.) After a few
minutes‘ I was stopped by the
Monroeville police, my name
_and address was taken and I
"was told to leave or else I would ~
be arrested for soliciting. The
policeman explained that solicit-
ing of any kind‘ “including votes”
was illegal. I asked him why Hu-
bert Humphrey was allowed to
solicit votes in the mall only a
few weeks earlier. The police-
man said that Hubert had “got-
ten permission.” I asked him how
I could get permission, just like
Hubert did. He said, “Look kid,
just get lost before I run you

In H

The next day, I’ was with some
friends who were putting up mor-
atorium posters on lamp posters
near the corner of Craig Street
and Center Avenue. A police car‘
stopped us and the officers said
that we were violating the law
because we were defacing public
property. Hubert’s benign xface
looked down on us from a poster
that his friends had put up on the
same lamppost only a few weeks
before. .

I pointed to the Humphrey sign
and asked, “Did you stop Hub-
ert from putting up his signs?”
The reply was that the Humphrey

Letters to the Editor

folks had “gotten permission.” I

then asked what agency in the.

city gave that permission and he
said, “Look, just keep it up and
somebody will run Y0“ 111- 
leave and we won’t say anything,
0.K.?” .

The. reason that Hubert “got
permission” was because he rep-
resents the power structure of this

«country. The supporters of the

May fourth moratorium or the
SDS Mayday demonstration are
those who are on the short end of
the nightstick because they seek

to stop the power wielders from

controlling our lives and the lives
of millions of Vietnames. _

Is there a double system of jus-
tice? My personal experience says
yes. Furthermore, the campus pol-
ice, by persecuting these SDS
members, only demonstrate the in-
sensitivity of the Administration to
the problems of political rep-
ression.

Divergent views

Dear Editor:

I have learned never to be
surprised by anything that hap-
pens at the University of Pitts-
burgh. However, I have not yet
learned not to feel indignant at
grossly unfair actions. Coming in
the wake of the arrest and prose-
cution by campus police of a
person for curculating a nomina-
ting petition for the Communist
Party, the recent arrest of three
SDS’ students just for putting
up innocuous signs, and the un-
relenting efforts of Campus Sec-
m'ity Chief Joseph Gil to prosecute
them demonstrates that the camp-
us of the University of Pittsburgh
is not a place where people who
profess divergent view points can
feel safe. ’

One would think that Campus
Security Chief Joseph Gil could.
find better waystofillhis time and
expend his energy. Or perhaps
Mr. Gil has deluded himself
with megalomanis pretensions and
seriously believes that by hound-
ing ‘ petitioners ‘and moratorium
advocates he is, preserving the
Cathedral of Learning from cer-
tain destruction and the United
States from irmninent subversion.-

But Mr. , Gil should take a
stab at trying to comprehend
that there are those of us who find
it difficult to believe that the
Cathedral of Learning is so
insubstantial a structure that the
addition of the milligram weight
of two pieces of paper would
cause the building to . come
crumbling down, and that there
are those of us who believe that
our nation’s political fabric is not
weakened but rather strengthened
when citizens are permitted to
carry out peaceful and legitimate
political actions.

The arresting officer's role can
be excused, since he was merely
acting as the irnplementer of
the policy that Mr. Gil formulated.
However, the policy itself and
the continued prosecution of the
three students carmot be justified.-

In his public explanation of the
arrests ‘and prosecution, Mr. Gil
stated" that anti-semitic slogans
had been appearing on campus
and that damage had been done
to university property. I certainly
agree that damage should not be
permitted to occur. But the.three
SDS students were not com-
mitting acts of destruction to
University buildings. They mere-
ly stuck up two signs advocat-
ing that people exercise the right
guaranteed under the Bill of
Rights to peacefully assemble for
the purpose of getting the gov-
ernrnent to redress certain grie-
vances regarding the conduct of a
war in a far-away Asian land,
and suggesting that people voice
disapproval of the University’s

  
 

connection with that war. What
damage was done? Are not citi-
zens permitted to have what Rob-
ert Frost called “lovers quarrels
with their country?” ' .

If somebody else has been do-
ing damage to University prope-
ty, and Chief of Campus Security
Joseph Gil has been unable to
apprehend them, why should
those SDS students, who were
irmocent of doing any damage,
have to suffer persecution in
place of those who have been do-
ing damage? No one should have
to suffer for a crime he didn’t
commit.

There were no anti-Semitic slo-
gans on the signs the students put
up. Why should the SDS stud-
ents who are innocent of putting
up offensive slogans have to suf-
fer in place of the -people who have
‘been putting up such slogans?$a

Campus Security Chief Joseph
Gil’s style of “justice” seems to
be to order arrests first and then
later make up some charges out
of thin air to explain the arrests
and to justify their continued pro-
secution.

Campus Security Chief Joseph
Gil and persons of his mentality
who occupy positions of authority
in the law enforcement apparatus
are much more dangerous to do-
mestic tranquility than the harm-

less people who serve as their =

victims. .

’-Editor, Pitt News:

On Thursday, May 4, the Stud-
ent Government Board met to con-
sider three budgetary recom-
menda- '
tions from the Allocations Com-
mittee. One of the three was for

- the‘ Nursing Student Organiza-
tion. As soon as the recommen-
dation was brought to the floor,
Terri‘ Weaver, a Student Govem-
ment Board member and a nurs-
ing student, disqualified herself
from the vote." '

This type of behavior by a’

member of the Student Govem-
ment Board is highly commen-
dable and speaks well for both
Weaver and the Board. Since the
adoption of the new Student Gov-
ernment constitution last fall,
there have been no by-laws in ef-
fect. This means that members of
the Student _Govemment Board
could vote to give more money
to those groups in which they
were members. Of course, such
an action would be highly suspect,
but perfectly permissable under
the present ‘circumstances.

Last year’s Allocations Commit-
tee and Student Government pre-
vented this type of behavior from
taking place within the Alloca-
tions Committee by instituting a
by-law preventing any members
of the Allocations Committee from
voting on the budgets of those
groups they belong to. Alloca-

tions Committee members have .

gone beyond. this to, the point of

leaving the room when the rest of C

the committee discusses the bud-
get of one of the groups they be-
long to.

It would be wise for the Stud-
ent Government Board to adopt
a similar ruling to help guard the
integrity of allocating student ac-
tivities fees. The by-laws commit-
tee, headed by Paul Symczyk
should_ consider this matter and
present a recommendation on it
in its final report to Student Gov-
ernment. " '

In the meantime, pther mem-
bers of the Student Government
Board should follow the lead that
Terri Weaver has set.

“It was a well played game. A
base hit here or there would have
broken the game wide open,” ex-
plained Pitt’s coach Bob Lewis
about the Panthers’ 3-1 loss’ against
the Penn State mitters on Friday
at Trees Hall Field.

The Panthers’ lack of timely hit-

_ ting was again the cause of their

defeat, as they now post a 7-3
record on the season.

’ PSU’s ace pitcher Jim Conroy,
now 6-0 this season,‘was racked
for nine. hits but only one run.-

The Pitt mitters managed to
leave nine men on base, bases
loaded in the second, two on in
fourth and ninth, and one in the
third and ﬁfth. -

After not scoring in a bases
loaded, one out situation in the
second, the mitters came back in
the fourth to take a one run lead.
Third baseman Paul Quarantillo
doubled to right ﬁeld and scored
on a double to the center field
fence by center fielder Scott
sufrin. - .

The Panthers maintained a 1-0
lead until the sixth inning when
the Lion hitters jumped on Pitt
rpitching for tworuns. ,

Conroy singled to right and
right ﬁelder Harry Rogers drove a
single past the shortstop. One of
the Nittany Lions top hitters, short-
stop Jerry Micsky, clubbed a
double to deep center ﬁeld, scoring
both Conroy and Rogers and giving
PSU a lead they never relin-
gulshed. _ .

Burkett explained that there
were two reasons why she chose

1 the’ Foreign Area Fellowship.

“Both grants covered basic ex-

Perhaps a more important rea-

work should take her at least a

“My grant is good for a mini-
mum of one year,” she said, “with
a possibility of a one year ex-
tension.”

Burkett also indicated that there
was an element of good fortune
involved‘ in her receiving the
grant.

“There are eight or ten basic
grants that persons who specialize
in Latin American history are

the people who sponsored the
fellowships to give a number,
of them to women this year.
Thus, women had somewhat of
an advantage over men this year.

However, Burkett was not say-
ing that it was entirely luck that
got her_the award.

“I know it’s a funny thing to
say,” she laughed, “but I felt I‘
really deserved it.” ’

By WILLIAM ALLEN, JR.
Many excellent bands on the

current scene get choked out of

their due acclaim by giants like
the Stones, Grand Funk, etc. One
of these bands is Savoy Brown,
an English group that continues
to prove its talent and versitil-
ity album after album.

Its latest LP, “Hellbound
'11-ain,”
(London) is no exception.

Savoy’s usual driving rhythm

75:. and blues is there, but things are
_::, polished a little. Guitarist Kim
 Simmonds switches from electric
 to accoustic on “Lost and Lonely
* Child,” a mellow, body-rnoving
"_> song. From there the band’s spir-

ited blues arrangements keep“ your

feet stompin’ and set you up
for the final crashing surprise. ‘
“Hellbound 'I‘rain,” the tital
ut, holds you in suspense from
the beginning. Something has to
happen, and does, with the entire

” band blasing full strength to-

ward the end. Words can’t des-

3" cribe the sheer energy of this
1- cut; you have to listen to it.

While we’re talking Savoy
Brown, the group’s. “Street Com-

A er Talking” (London), released

earlier, is probably Savoy’s great-
est achievement. The English

 mate, the Flair Hot Liner.)

blues are there, plus some old-
fashioned rock ’n’ roll and a typi-
cal Savoy Brown surprise. Sim-
monds’ guitar work is excellent;
the best he’s ever done.

The group has recently been
touring America. Catch them if
you can. Superstardom is knock-
ing at Savoy Brown’s door, and we
may never see them again.

Blood, Sweat & Tears is making
wives once more. Columbia fin-
ally released a Greatest Hits LP
and little needs to be said.

'It’s a collection of the group’s
best” from Al Kooper and the 1967
beginnings through _1971 and
David Clayton-Thomas. To name
a few now Golden Great-
s: “You’ve
Made Me So Very Happy,” “I
Can’t Quit Her,” “Spinning
Wheel,” “And When I Die,” “Go
Down Gamblin!”

Few bands have contributed as
much to popular music as has
BS&T. To quote Playboy: “Blood,
Sweat and Tears are still first
and best in the field they
created.”

David Clayton-Thomas and his A

record-selling voicehave left
BS&T, and everybody’s wonder-
ing what the group will do. The

   

Current bands choked by giants

guess here is that they’ll survive
Clayton-Thomas’ split as they
did Kooper’s. 'I‘hey’re too good to
fold. .

Al Kooper‘, who founded BS&T -
and then quit, has switched from-
keyboard vituoso to super-musi-I

- cian for his latest Columbia LP,

“A Possible Projection of the Fu- »

ture-Chi1dhood’s' End.”

He now plays, in addition to
piano and organ: guitar, three

different synthesizers, melotron,'

sitar, and a host of background
blend- ~
Add to this Kooper’s raspy, mel-
odic voice plus six original com-
positions, and you have one hell-
uva record. . ~
Kooper has deep roots
past: the pre-acid rock music he
grew up with. He’s not afraid to
let these roots come to the sur-
face in “Projection.” The al-
bum is a good one for a young»
generation that is torn between the
"seeet, goodtime tunes of the six-
ties and the‘ driving, progressive
rock of today. This new LP con-
tains a nice blend of both.

A strange, new group is pro-
ducing light, happy music in the
spirit of the season. They call
themselves the Rascals.

These days you don't have to look
very farto find a small, economical car
But to find one that's economical
and a pure-bred, SCCA—winning
sports car—wel|, that leaves you a

‘choice of about one.

MG Midget.
Just the right size for you, your

friend and enough gear to see you

through a weekend.

You’ll discoverthat the real
meaning of “sports motoring" has
nothing to do with 1/4-mile strips a
abandoned airports_. »

It has to do with roads that take

I to the hills where the scenery and

fresh air are. Roads that turnand twist
and meander down the other side,
faithful to the contours.of nature.
That's where terms like rack-and-
pinion steering, front disc brakes,
race—seasoned suspension and a
close—ratio 4-speed gearbox, start
making sense to the uninitiated.
And you'll wonder how you

MG MIDGET
it’s a lot of sports car fora little price.

ever drove without full sports car

instrumentation: an electric tachometer,

separate gauges for oil pressure,
watertemperature and fuel level.
There's even a trip odometer.

MG Midget sports otherstandards
like a 1275 c.c. overhead valve
engine, mag-style wheels, radial-ply
tires, leather steering wheel cover,
reclining bucket seats, full carpeting
and three-blade windshield wipers.
