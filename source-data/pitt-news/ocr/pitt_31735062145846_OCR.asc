The‘ ratio of the working to the to-

is to raise ‘the power.-factor-. to unit ,_

the Fynn-Weichsel motor does more
successfullythan it has ever been
done before. It is » si.m.ila'r’ in
construction to the old slip‘-ring mo-

commutator, which takes the neces-

armature rather than from the power-

) Although -we cannot question the
truth of the synonymity of “ignor-
ance” and “lack of knowledge”, we do
question the recognition of their like.-
ness by most persons. it has often
been said that a person who talks a
«lot usually has little to say- That
kind of "person considers himself any-
thing’ but ignorant yet in many ‘cases

The particular reference} to which
we used our sentence was to the reg-
istration problem. We can‘ say with
conﬁdence that hardly‘ one student
really knows the actual‘ information,
or has the knowledge of the condi-
tions‘ and problems of registration,
yet none of them refrain from giving
their earnest opinion about it. A

If our sentences become -banal be‘-
cause of their utter obviousness we
would have them so, even if they must

Captain Carr’s‘ Timely Goal Ends Fray at 31-30——Flanagan,
Prostrate on Floor, Kicked by Outsider—Riot N arrowly
Averted-Panthers All Brilliant--State Form 1 Perfect '

 

OOLLY, smoothly, deliberately, and accurately working against the hard-

’ iest foe on the annual basket ball card,.the supreme production of the

‘ hands of the master floor coach, Dr. .“Red”. Carlson, doggedly rose as a me-

teor to dazzle even the satellites of the far-famed passers of the Pennsylvania

State College, brazenly blazing across the murky ﬁrmament of Pitt HI“

enveloping the miserably cramped Trees Gymnasium to twist the tawney

mane ofthe shaggy Nittany Lion, 31-30, in the most riotous and tumultuous

~ basket ball sessicnever held on-the apex of the Ohio, Allegheny and Monon-
‘gahela Rivers. , l

‘ Fight, action, excitement, spirit and thrills, capped bya general free-fon

.all riot threat, sent a host of nervous rooters into paroxysms of spasmodically

uncontained joy and alternate fearful apprehension, demanded recourse to

‘the interference of heavy night-sticks wielded by‘huge blue-coated Pittsburgh,

policemen, caused one arrest,-and ended with a Gold and Blue neck-band of a
victorious "but badly battered Panther flying triumphantly from the tail of a
-defeated Mount Nittany Lion. The average individual called it a basket.

“Throughout the clash the --S‘taters

player. Flanagan, ﬂaring up with a
great sense of injustice and prompted
by‘ the nausea of the contemptible
trick, turned upon the offender with a
gleam of a smoldering vengeancein
his deep blue eyes. A list shot from

ment of the thrilled and stupeﬁed
crowd, was answered from the lines.
Another round’, a veritable shower,
and the nearer rooters took up the
ﬁght. Bedlam reigned. The ﬁghters
were separated, oﬂicers rushed to the
vicinity, and in ten minutes quiet was
restored and the game resumed ‘after
the instigator was removed from the
hall and lodged in the station house.
At this point an oﬂicial decision
barred Flanagan from the remainder
of the game but Coach‘Carlson re-
fused to make the substitution.

- differences settle'cl,—students of the University are coolly. giving due
 thought to the calamity that marred the evening. Almost did hot-headed and
‘frenzied rooters form a mob and assume mob-spirit to do the cowardly work,
of insane instants. Although such a state of affairs existed for about ten
€"‘gyi‘nutes until city policemen took the delicate situation safely into hand,
, one might freely say that the Pitt record has not again been besmirched by
— a repetition of the Tech embroglio ofxseveral years ago. Due credit must
also be given to level-headed State backers ‘in the assemblage. As for Flan-
‘ . -agan and his actions in‘~the_ tumultuous eon,‘ long to. be remembered by under-
‘- graduates, he did nothing but what any live, red-blooded Yankee would do’
. , ~_to such a yellow, whimpering, and interfering cur who found his way into the
I ‘gymnasium to perpetrate such a grossly foul deed. The Pittsburh coach,
'“Red”_ Carlson, stuck gam.ely to his rights in demanding the officials to keep
l“Ho_ot'.,’ in the fray after he» had been ejected. To the Nittany. mentor.
,“Du,tch” Hermann, not enough praise and glory can fall upon his head as
the peer of sporting-bloods, his generous request to hold Flanagan in the
game coming from his heart and sense of‘ fairness to vindicate American col-
/ _~leg‘iate-athletics. May Pittsburgh and State students ever unite in -ostrasizing
the cowardly offender from the ‘Association of good men,.meanwhile hoping
against hopeﬁthat he may in no way be attached to the State institution.

 

’ ARE PITT WHEELS TURNING BACKWARDS’?
N ECHO-answer “No!” In fact they are not but the forward motion of
progress som_etimes appears to be so very slow. Several weeks ago it
.was generally announced that the final elimination series of the Western
.Pe'nnsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League, basket ball teams will be
played in the new Tech Gym instead of on the Trees floor on the Pitt campus.
For years and years this series has been held under Pitt auspices and a Pitt
trophy awarded'~the winner. The change was made for the better, the
cramped Trees Gym allowing few spectators to witness the clashes so vitally
‘important to West _Penn High ‘Schools. This is just another indication of
, Pitt lo_sing out and Tech gaining an advantagethrough the possession of
real facilities. For such a deplorable state of affairs from a Pitt standpoint,
there «is only one remedy the organization of all Pittites, present and past,
Alto keep on a par or ahead of Tech, Pitt's only dangerous rival for superorlty

A  LITTLE   DDPE 

THE INTER-FRATERNITY TRACK SITUATION

 At last it is hoped the Inter-fraternity council in charge of making-the
rules for the inter-frat track competition has learned its lesson, and that in
the future it may be more careful in the drawing up and ratiﬁcation of the
same. The old, old. story was enacted last week in the way of mid-season
changes in the rules that govern the competition, -and__ln so doing has come
close to opening a breach within the inter-fraternity circles. The amend-
ment passed barred from further inter-fraternity track competition all letter
and numeral winners‘ in Cross Country. Four men were effected by the
ruling, they are Howell, Kappa Sigma; Kerr and Robinson of Sigma Pi, and
Lies of ‘Phi Kappa, all 'Freshmen‘numeral winners in Cross Country last fall,
but who under thefrggles were eligible, until last Tuesday. '

The justice of such a ruling is’ not for me to dwell upon,

 

but I do be

lieve that the middle of the series is a very inopportune time t9 amend rules .

in‘ effect, especially-when a team looms strong with certain runners eligible,
and when their victory is practically assured to have the Council vote to
pass an--amendment that will considerably weaken them. The time to make
rules is before the ﬁrst race, not after thg series is well under way.

Two years ago the Alpha Phi Alpha "colored fraternity was permitted to
compete. But when they broke several records, the Inter-fraternity Council
decided that they were not to be permitted to compete further. Last year
the Phi Gamma Delta team was the victim of the circumstances and_the way
matters ﬁnallyl ended the mistake cost them’ a little larger cup» than the one
they ﬁnally won.- This year the Sigma Pie and the Kappa Sigmas are the
loser by a late amendment. , 1 ' '

Whether this late amendment is a good one or not is not for me to
decide, but it does seem that a little more care in" the future in drafting of
track rules will be conduciveto better feeling among the several fraternities,
for! after all the two primary purposes of’ the track series are first, to make
better inter-fraternity feeling,fand second, to work through the fraternities
in getting new track men out for the varsit and Freshmen squads. Good
rules as to eligibility will aid the latter, but those rules should be passed,
not in the middle of the season when it loo? |ike.a set-uptb swing the series’
another way, but should come before; the ' ompetition is opened, for if they
do not they tend to kill the remaining p'urpose'of the games, that of breed-
ing better Inter-fraternity spirit. Surely a session similar to the council
meeting held last Tuesday night is not in accordance with the purpose, and

what took place in amending-the rules last week” has aided feeling between
the fraternities very little.

' in the future, if the Council makes a slip in‘ the rules it would seem adr
visable to make the change‘ for the following year, not for theremainder of
the-series. A good plan is-to have the council exert more care with the rules
in the future. . .

As matters stand at present there is still another point that threatens
to throw the Inter-fraternity circles into another difficult position, and that
is the matter of placing additional events on the program. ,3-.Much talk is
current at the present time to the effect that one and possibly two :.events are

to be added. The ‘addition_of these events must be in the very near future“

or trouble'is sure. The series is going to be close and the teams that lead
at the end of'the already scheduled races are notiggoing to permit the addi-
tion of new events that threaten to cause their defeat. The situation is
going to be very much like the present! situation, the leaders will accuse the
other members of the conference of attempting to beat them out by running
in new events. The time is even now too late for additional events, but if
those in charge wish to add them, they had better act in the near‘future.-

Panther Gigsls defeated by the Univer-
sity ofmcincinnati team last Saturday
night in one of the best -girls’ games
ever staged at the Ohio University.
The ﬁnalscore was~'32 to 30;

At the opening whistle the Pitt ._team~
jumped intofthe lead and at the end
of, the ﬁrst quarter held a 12 to 7 edge.
During the secondiquarter the home
team appeared to ﬁnd itself and made
the going a little more rough for the
visitors, scoring 10 points %while Pitt
could account for but 3, the half-time
ﬁnding the home team on the long
end of a 17 to’ 15 score. This-two point
lead proved to bathe necessary ad-
vantage. for the two teams each
scored the .same number" of counters
during‘ the second half, making 15
apiece, the ﬁnalwhistle found Coach
M‘c‘;Clenahan’s charges ﬁghting for-all
that was in them to bring the victory
‘back to the Smoky City.. The at-
t7emﬁts_ were fruitless however and the
game‘ ended with ,a two-point advan-
tage for the locals. - Each team had
thesame number of ‘ﬁeld goals but the
Clncy co-eds scored two more foul
goals, which ﬁnally proved to be the
necessary pointers. 3 Last year these
‘two teams played a 17 to 17 tie at
Trees Gym. This defeat marks the

Sextet, in four games. A

- a it -Mutter was the scoring star for the

iPanthe.-rs while‘ Olga Strashun was
best for» -Cincinnati. _
Thegirls’ game was played as a
preliminary to the University of Cin-
cinnati and University of Virginia
varsity game, the latter team winning
by a two point margin. The evening.
program also contained the ﬁnal
‘games of the ‘State ‘Interscholastic
Tournament that had been in progress
for three"days of continuous play.
Seventy-two teams had been elimi-
.nated. A great body of Ohio coaches
were present to witness -the contests.
The neat. new Blue and Gold uni-
forms of the Pitt team that met with
wide approval when ﬁrst’ introduced
at the Pitt-Geneva game last week
brought ‘a, long round of applause from
the great crowd when the team ran
out on the ﬂoor. The suits are new
to this section, having been modeled
after those used by the co-ed teams
on,'the Paciﬁc Coast. Coach McClen-
ahan, while attending school on the
coast last summer, was attracted by

-the design and persuaded the Pitt

authorities to equip the team with
them. ( - ‘
