As Officers
At’ Newport

Six Pitt men are among the 530
graduates who received their Navy
Commission in graduation cere-
monies at the United States Navy’s
Officer Candidate School, Newport,
R. I. Vice Admiral James L. Hol-
loway, Jr., Chief of Naval Per-
sonnel, was the principal speaker.

Pitt graduates include the fol-
lowing: Peter H. Block, B.A., Col.,
’55; Ralph E. McCullough, B.S.,
Eng., ’54; Leonard T. Kern Jr., B.S.,
Eng., "52; Alfred G. Lunz, B.S.,
Eng., ’54; Bruce A. Giron, B.S.,
Engr., ’53; Harry M. Drew Jr.,
B.B.A., ’54.

V‘ Two fraternity men are Block,
Zeta Beta Tau and Pi Lambda
Phi, and McCullough, Delta Tau
Delta.

The graduates have ﬁnished a
four—month indoctrination course
in Seamanship, operations and tac-
tics, naval weapons, marine engi-
neering, navigation, and naval or-
ientation and military law.

This academic schedule, about
one and one half times that of
the average college, supple-
mented with the rigid military
routine of the school, has equip-
ped the graduates to serve as
junior officers aboard Navy com-
mands. '

In the class of 530, 310 officers
commissioned in the Naval Re-
serve are college graduates, repre-
senting some 160 colleges and uni-
versities across the country. Two
hundred and twenty former petty
ofﬁcers, chief petty ofiicers, and
warrant officers were commission-
ed into the regular navy.

Oﬁicers were selected from thou-
sands of applicants -in the ﬂeet
as the annual contingent of the
Navy’s “Seaman to Admiral” pro-
gram. The integrated class, ﬂeet
and college men, has set an ex-
cellent example in military and
academic performance, Navy of-
ﬂcials reported.

The ‘La Prensa

By lrv Rofhmon

For four years he had inain-
tained silence. Exiled by dicta-
tor Juan Pe!'(,'.1, he had first
sought asylum in Uruguay and
then tied to the United States for
the freedom which had been
robbed fromlhim, and his people
in Argentina.-
And because,
there was littl
h e c o u 1 d 'd
that w a s n 0
being done by
others, he sat
and watched as ..

tory ‘unfolded

political asy-' ’_
lum himself. «
‘La Prensa‘ Darkened

But this ian who sat and
waited, whose property had been‘
conﬁscated, left behind influence
that weighed heavy against Per-
on. For, when ‘he escaped,,there

was left  the country no ap- '.
parent protagonist for freedom’s ’

most powerful weapon, the free
press. There remained onlyrthe
darkened tragedy of the La
Prensa building. The world’s
fourth greatest newspaper ‘had
been closed down. .

Dr.’ Alberto Gai_nza Paz, a
rather large fellow with a~doub1e
chin and usually" a smile on his
‘face,’ became the modern Garri-
son as he lost the ﬁrst round
against Peron’s criminal tactics.
For the ﬁrst time in 81 years,
three -generations of the -Paz,
family, La. Prensa ‘failed to
appear on the news stands. Eva
and Juan‘ Peron realized the
ultairnate in dictatorship. Their
only steps from then on -were to
maintain such status quo and‘-
then to _dip downward. .

What were some‘ of th

crimes. that the opposition
newspaper had committed
against the government?

Dull Buf Obiecfive

Althouﬂh. by comparison to
American newspapers, it may
have looked dull—it carried ad-
vertising almost completely .on
the ﬁrst few pages as did the

London Times  South Amer-.

ica’s leading newspaper was
restrained and scrupulously ob-
jective. It , carried complete
foreign and doinestic reporting,
syndicating articles and supple-
ments to_ some one hundred and

seventy-ﬁve o t h e 1' Argentine 4

newspapers. l
»But it didn’t,.iust say that‘

, which was just; it did those .-

things which would exemplify
the right. that. it expounded.

La Prensa had operated a free
health clinic, and offered free
legal advice to the poor. The
.paper paid for a freeindustrial

and agricultural bureau and had 7

its library constantly open to,the
public. To encourage literacy, Dr.

Paz offered 1,000 pesos to the»

person who taught the largest
amount of illiterates to read.

Public Conscience

A La Rezion, an evening com-
petitorof La Prensa adequately
listed Peron’s‘ greatest objection
to the newspaper when it edi-~

torialized, about Paz_’s paper, “It ’

is «a safe andserene guide in the
difficult task of creating a public
conscience.” ,
~ As far as Peron.-was con-
cerned, the journalistic “30”
signifying‘ the end of an article
wasgwritten to the La Prensa.
But the din of an outraged world
touched his sensitive ears. In
Chile, La Nacion urged the free
world to refuse to print news
from Argentina until La Prensa
was restored. 1
The New York Herald-Tribune
saw signs of weakening in the
dictatorship as it wrote, “It is
obvious that Peron, more than
ever before is<fearful of what a

Free Press can do to his regime ‘'

and that his hold onthe countr-y
requires constant tigtening”.

18, 1953. In an annual May Day
speech,‘ Peron called for a probe
against'United States news agen-
cies to ‘investigate “lies and
slander” and the possibility of
American newsmen working as

.. spies.

 _INS, UP, and AP were're-
Vfused by all Argentine news-
papers and Government radio-
telegraph lines were refused. to
these sources for newspapers
out of Buenos Aires.
The ﬁnal subjugation’, how-

’ ever, of free newspapers in Ar-

gentina enabled Peron to carry
out his ideal of “personalismo”-—-
absolute rule based on demo-y

goguery and personal popularity '

with the masses.

During the newspaper war,
Peron enhanced a great follow-
ing by strengthening the Genera-1
Confederation "of Labor (CGT)
which had in 1946 brought to-
gethei‘ country gauchos and city
workers for the ﬁrst time--he,
their champion. ' .
Respecl-ed" Officer ,

As a respected officer in Lthe
army movement, Peron quickly
saw to it that political parties be
abolished and out—o'f-office poli-
tici-ans, who had cheered; the
revolutionary coup in 1943: that
put-him into power had the op-

portunity t'o sob in their beers.

Argentina businessmen and
overt. nationalists were satisﬁed
in turn with the seizure or con-
ﬁscation of a great many foreign
properties. However, the _ delus-
ion was sh_ort lived. The charms

' of the man, the viciousness of his
‘attack temporarily blinded these
groups. _ »_
Buenos Ajres Harvesf
.High exports" placed ‘one all’
ports, except ,Buenos Aires, in-_
creased the B.A. commerce.-but
degraded the remaining ; areas.

The great wealth expended in ,

Buenos Aires to business and in.
,. . I
behalf of commercial enterprises

- was conﬁned to the capital city,-

_while the inferior cattle industry
which had during the war been
so lucrative dipped downward.
After the Second World War,
Argentina was rich from hav-
ing supplied necessary beef
hides. But _ Peronistic policy
bought cattle low and sold. it
high—proﬁ'ts going into the
state Welfare’ fund for Buenos
Aires workers. CGT, Peron’s
.1argest backers, received their
beneﬁts——a_nd he received their
votes. Interior cattlemen ‘suf-
fered. , . ‘ ‘

The attraction of city beneﬁts
has caused desertion of
ranch, enough to be economically
painful, And presently, in the
world’s .beef center, steaks ‘are
rationed. ' ..

The Argentine dollar has been
drastically reduced on the world

scale. The‘ shenanigans of an
'egocentzic idolizer of Benito
Mussolini have caused disrest

and havoc in a government which
had for ninety years followed
democratic government before
him.. '

The Peronista government,
however, had even in the last, a
great following. Although, it was
involved in conﬂicts with both

"army officials and the Catholic

'. Example

the .

Recently, Peron swelled be-
yond even his own capabilities,
and attempted to subjugate the
church under the commands oi
the state will. In a country 90%;
Catholic which requires that “El
Presidento” be Catholic, he com-
mitted the inexorable folly of
dictators—- believing themselves
to be so beyond thevlimits of the
state institutions that they can
create their own.

Three Bullefs Per Rifle

In the last months, somearmy

units suspected of'having dis-

loyal elements found ‘themselves _

with only two ‘or three bullets per
rifle. As long as he asked for the
support of the army, he had his
military strength. But when he
offered ammuntion and guns to
the masses and mob—the union
employees -— as he did during
early-September, 195-5, threaten-
ing even the position . of . his»
closest
found himself alienated from not
onlyireligious sympathy, but also
armed support.

And then Dr._.Alberto Gainza
Paz wrotefor the United Press;
his ﬁrst public pronuncia-
mento about -the whole grue-
some war. ~

Referring to the Peronista rule

since World War II, Paz wrote’

.r

“During ‘the 10 years". . {the Ar. A ' i

gentines have been shamed’ and

humiliated;'their legislature and -
courts and .. schools were cor-'

rupted, their labor unions,were
taken over by Peron, ‘the, coun-
try’s resources were squandered
‘in graft. Their Free,Press,- with-'
outno other freedom could exist,
was‘m_urdered.” « V a

ponent of Peron’s, has _ been

merit; a military ‘junta of four-

settle and subdue the affairs of
' state. . .

No ‘Comment-_ On Refurn
However, Dr. Paz is happy over
the results, he is cautious and has

declined to comment on whether "

he would attempt to return soon
to his belabored country..
Military rule still prevails‘

,over Argentina. The prospect .

of censorship and possibly
similar dictatorship is preva-
lent. Even Peron, who still has
» many _friends in the country,
cannot be ruled out as forever
exiled. ,

An assuring word comes from
A. Hugo, Grassi of Montevideo,
‘Uruguay, general seci'etary of the
South American Federation of
YMCAs. The YMCA secretary
said that Chile is friendly to
Peron along with a few“~other
countries, but none will provide
him with military support,‘ He
warned however, “He is a’ dan-
gerous man . . . he has proved
he will stop at nothing.”

Whether he comes back or not, '

we can be assured that Argen-
tina will be in democratic hands
when La. Prensa._is restored to
the prominent place it once held.
And once La Prensafs presses
start running, any comeback. b

ANYONE. ‘FOR FOOTBALL?’

Pancho Sigafoos, pale and sensitive, ﬁrst saw Willa Ludovic,
lithe as a hazel wand and fair as the morn, outside a class -in

money and banking. “Let us not hem and haw,” said Pancho to t A

Willa. “I adore you.” -

“Thanks, hey,” said Willa, blushing prettily. “What position

do you play?” . ~ _ ,
“Position ?” said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The askance
is a ligament just behind the ear.) _ ‘ ’ -.

“On the football team,” said Willa- . V

/Zé’/2.0

“Football!” cried Pancho, his lip curling in horror. “Football _-

is violence, and violence is the death’ of the mind. I am not a
footballplayer. I am a poet.” A ‘ '
“So long, mac,” said Willa". »
“Wait!” cried Pancho, clutching "her lissome young forearm. ‘
. She placed her foot on his pelvispand wrenched herself free. .

“I only go with football players,” she said and walked,,shim- . 

mering, into the setting sun. » '

Pancho-went to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered hisj‘ 
vexing problem. What kind of cigarette did Pancho light? Why 

Philip Morris, of corris! A “.

Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than -when ~ 
you are weary and sore beset. When a fellow needs a friend,’ '

when the heart is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, when

darkness prevails, then, then above all,»is the time for the mild- -_ 

ness and gentleness that only Philip Morris can provide. .
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psychewelded, his fevered brow_
cooled, his synapses restored after smoking a gentle Philip“
Morris, came swiftly to a decision. Though he was rather small
for football (an even four feet) and somewhat overweight (370
pounds) he tried out for the,team—and tried out with such «pluck
and perseverance that he made it. ' I

Pancho’s college opened-the seasbn against the Manhattan.  '

School of Mines. The Miners were always a mettlesome foe, but

this year, strengthened by four exchange students-from Gi-‘ . ‘

braltar who had been suckled by she-apes, they were especially
formidable. By the middle of the second quarter, the Miners had
wrought such havoc upon Pancho’s team that there was nobody
left on the bench but Pancho. And when the quarterback was
sent to the inﬁrmary with his head driven into his ribcage, the
coach had no choice but to put Pancho in. . :
Pancho’s team-mates were riot conspicuously cheered as the ‘

little! fellow t0ok'his place. in the huddle. “Gentlemen,” said .

Pancho, “some of you may regard poetry as sissy stuff, but
nowin our most trying hour I can think of no words more apt
than these lines from Milton's Paradise Lost: ‘All is not lost;
the unconquerable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and

~ courage never to submit or yield!’ ”

So stirred was Pancho’s team by this ﬁery exhortation that,_

they threw themselvesinto the fray: with utter abandon.

As a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before
the half. The college was forced‘ to drop football. Willa Ludovic",“
not having any football players to choose -from, took up with '
Pancho and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Todag they
are seen everywhere together-dancing, holding hands, smok
ing, smooching. -

Smoking what? Why, Philip Morris, of -corris!

Panthers Fool
Foes, Experts

By GENE AROMATORIO
Sports Editor

 

By GENE AROMATORIO
. Sports Editor

Some of this year’s Pitt grid opponents are more than
mildly surprised and others are possibly due for a bigger Jolt
before long. _ ,

Picked by the pre-season prognosticators to win about
half their games, the Panthers have caused these experts to
sit back and ponder a bit.

True, there is nothing sensational in the mere fact
that John Miche1osen’s gridders whipped California and Syra-
cuse. They were favored both times. '

But the -eyebrow-raisingpart of it is the manner in which Pitt
has handled the opposition. Against the Bears, the Panthers com-
pletely outplayed their West Coast visitors and won by a 20-point
margin. And, if it hadn’t been for the eight Pitt fumbles, the score
would have been twice as bad. ’

It wasn’t the score alone which caused the football experts to
blink twice, however, but it was the vastly-improved ground game
and line play that was displayed.

‘* The Panther backs were good enough to roll up -274 yards
via rushing and were much more impressive than at any time
last year. * ,

On -the line, which this year is minus tackles Lou Palatella and
Eldred Kraemer, there wasn’t one game last year- '(except‘at West
Virginia) where the forward wall performedas well as the line-

Shrewd Swamis
Slightly Stunned
By Ripon Romp

An investigation of the select-
ing swamis from the eighth ﬂoor
was gotten under-way after the
weekend’s football results came
in. For the second straight week
the yog_is were respectable—even
cellar-dweller Rothman man-
aged to pick eight of ten right. s

Still hanging on to his tem-
porary lead is writer Butchock
who cam_e through with eight for
ten, missing on only the UCLA-
Maryland clash and the Mon-
mouth-Ripon struggle which
fooled all but ’Michelosen.

At last week’s seance, Michel-
osen was the only -yogi to select
the Rippers while the other
swamis were content to stick to
the heavy favorite, Monmouth.

It develops now that jaunty
John had a cousin playing for
Ripon who gave John the inside
dope. Result: Ripon ripped off
a 38-6 win over the befuddled
Monmouthites.

The other yogi charts showed
Aromatorio with 8-2, Michelo-
sen 7-2 (he wouldn’t pick Pitt-
Syracuse), and guest Harold
Hunter with 7-3. Ole master
consensus took a whipping this
week by calling three wrong

men did against Cal.

As good as Kraemer and Pala-
tella were, there have’nt been any
more gains made through Bob Pol-
lock and Herman Canil than were
made against last year’s duo.

In addition to having ﬁlled
these tackle posts. quite satis-
factorily, the entire line has im-
proved over last season. A year’s
experience can do a world of
good for a player and it has for
most of thelinemen. Joe Walton
for ‘instance, though highly re-
garded last year, missed tackles
then that he hasn’t been missing
this year.

Another-point which was known ‘
before the season opened, but,
which has become even more evi- 
dent, is the tremendous depth at*
Michelosen’s disposal.

In these ﬁrst two games, Mich-
elosen has used two different
teams with ‘no noticeable differ-
ence in the performance of either.
In fact, he's had the third-string
lineup in there plenty and there’s-
been no serious lag. ~ ’

Against Syracuse this depth
became especially obvious when 
the second team replaced the [
starters after the ﬁrst quarter. I
The first -string line hadn’t l
played up to par in the open- .
ing period so the reserves were 5
sent in to pick things up.

The Panther defense began
perking as it should and in the
second half rolled nito high gear
by holding Syracuseto only six
yards rushing for the first half
and a game total of 98! Not‘bad
against a team that averaged 230;
yards per game on the ground last
year.

Twice Daily Workouts.
Put Booters in Shape

While the gridders hold two-day practices at Ellsworth
Center, Coach Leo Bemis also puts his soccer squad through
a pair of workouts at Trees Field. The sessions run from 9:30
to 11:30 in the morning and 1:30 to 3:30 in the afternoon.

After this week’s drills, the booters will taper off until
they start into the schedule nexté
Tuesday. The Tuesday opener
ﬁnds the Panther booters scuffling
with the Indiana Teachers away
from home.

After the inaugural with the
Teachers, the Bemismen tear into
a s c h e d u'l e
which is dotted
with some of
the biggest soc-
cer powers in
the nation.

N u m b e r e d
among the Pan-
ther opponents
this season are

sity competition, the Panther
kickers made more than a favor-
able impression with some of the
better teams in this district. The
Bemis booters were able to chalk
up a very impressive 8-1 record-
not bad for a first year effort.

The reason Bemis feels his boys
can do a repeat performance even
though the schedule is much
tougher is that he has a ﬁne nu-
cleus headed by Mike Culhane re-
turning from last year’s Cinderella
eleven. Last year Culhane -was
both a defensive and offensive

standout.

City Business Up _
To Balance Drop

Listed Labor Day

About one-half of the drop in I
business in the Pittsburgh district

reported over the Labor Day holi-
day period was recovered last
week, according to the Bureau of
Business Research of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Gains were re-
ﬂected in nearly all _lines of activ-
ity, the more impressive increases
being. in. shipments and in the
volume of trade. '

The Pittsburgh steel ingot rate
last week moved up to 97.5, the
highest since late Junefthe num-
ber of active blast furnaces’ held
unchanged. Bituminous coal "pro-
duction increased to the level pre-
ailing- before the holiday; electric
power was up appreciably. Like-

wise, freight carloadings and river 1

traffic showed large increases from
the week ended Sept. 10.

Bank clearings were the‘ second
highest reported for the year, and
department store sales recovered
sharply. New motor car registra-
tions were up from the preceding
week but the gain was ‘less than
seasonal. Gross sales of Pittsburgh
department stores in the four
weeks ended Sept. 17 were 26 per

A cent greater than in the compar-

able four weeks in 1954.

After, allowances for seasonal
changes-, the index of general busi-
ness activity rose to 195.0 per cent
of the 1935-39 averagelast week;

it was 194.0 a month earlier and ,

198.8 at the middle of July.
