Pitt’s 2013 football season was one of an-

ticipation and hope for the future, espe-
cially since the University’s athletic pro-

‘ grams recently joined the Atlantic Coast A

Conference. .

Most eyes were ﬁxated on what was
to come in the ACC, but some recognized
the importance of the past and how Pitt.
football reached its present status.

In honor of the new conference and in

j memory of all past triumphs, a photogra— ' A
V phy exhibit called “Pitt Football: Through

the Years” will be open until Friday. The
exhibit features a rotating selection of
hundreds of pictures, with 15 shown at a
time, accompanied by a brief caption that
‘describes the images’ signiﬁcance in Pitt’s
124—year—long football history. .
Miriam Meislik, the media curator o

s Pitt’s Archives Service Center, said she

came up with the basic idea of the exhibit
and played a part in the selection and pre-
sentation of the photos that are included.

“I wanted to represent the evolution
of Pitt football,” Meislik said.

Meislik said she wanted the exhibit to
include past coaches and players, as well
as other aspects .of the football program’s
history. Forivleislik, the story of Pitt’s
football program should includeeleménts

is an ongoing collaboration between the
Office of Technology Management, Office
of Enterprise Development and Institute for
Entrepreneurial Excellence. According to
its coordinators, the institute will consoli-
date the three departments’ efforts to better
support students developing and market-
ing their ideas on campus and throughout
the region.

The expansion of the Innovation Insti- *

tute will span several years.
“Forming this comprehensive institute
will allow previously separate units to inte-

grate their resources and avoid duplication -

of services,” Beeson said in a statement.

Haley agreed that the combination of
talents will enhance innovational success.

“I think the [Innovation] Institute will
help those that come up with an invention,”
Haley said. “Where people in business come
inpis they’ll be the ones that, after the in-
vention is made, will help move it to that
commercialized product.” _

Marc Malandro, the Office of Technol-
ogy Management director and the Inno-
vation Institute interim director, said the
Innovation Institute is currently addressing
administrative tasks to merge the three
offices. He said he predicts the institute’s
development will take at least two to three
years, and it will need about ﬁve additional
years to reach culmination.

Over the next several years, the merging
advisors, faculty and consulting students
will work together to “get the' wheels roll-
ing” on the Innovation Institute, according
to Malandro. The institute will hire new
employees and plan events leading to its
full development.

According to Institute for Entrepre-
neurial Excellence founder Ann Dugan, the
Gardner Steel Conference Center, located
at the intersection of Thackeray Avenue

and O’Hara Street, will house the new in-
stitute. The space will undergo renovation
this semester, and it should be completed
next spring. ’

Dugan said the Ofﬁce of Technology
Management focuses more on working with
students and faculty on commercializing
their inventions, whereas the Institute for

Opportunities for idea growth

The Innovation Institute will host a
number of events throughout the semester.

Startup Weekend will take place from
Jan. 24 at 5 p.m. to Jan. 26 at 2:30 p.m. in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom. Startup
Weekend is a hands—on event that occurs
globally and connects entrepreneurs with
aspiring entrepreneurs to experiment with
startup ideas, according to its website.

Babs Carryer, an entrepreneurship
professor at Carnegie Mellon University
and Pitt, and Mark Visco, a Pitt student,
marketer and entrepreneur, organize the
event at Pitt.

In addition to Startup -Weekend‘, the

who competeforthe funds andresources
to launch their own business and actualize
their hopes and dreams.

Lastiyear, Pitt’s David Berg Center for
Ethics and Leadership hosted the competi- ’
tion. The eventwas previously hosted by
Pitt’s Institute for Entrepreneurial Excel-
lence from 2009 through 2012. '

The top ﬁve teams that participated in
last[year’s competition received a total of
$85,000. 0 .

Four grand prizes, each worth $20,000,
will incite this year’s—teams to market their
ideas. A winning team from an additional
“wild-car ” category will receive $5,000.

“Not only will [the participants] be able
to havemuch more support and assistance,

but it always takes money to commercialize _ ,

something, so 'there’s a nice price on it,’-’
Dugan said.

Carryer, who will also organize the
competition, said the visibility provided

by the Innovation Institute will bring the

competition “much more to the fore for
students and faculty.”

Malandro echoed her conﬁdence.

“It’s the ﬁrst time we’ve offered a num-
ber of different programs from different
schools,” Malandro said. “You’ll walk out
with a business opportunity.”

According to the Office of Technology
Management’s annual report, Pitt faculty
members, staff members and students
submitted 254 invention disclosures, or
conﬁdential reports of ideas, to the ofﬁce.
These disclosures included plans for soft-
ware, medical devices, processor inventions

EDITORIAL COLUMN P

Bridgegatezi Political media spews news

against Christie, protects Obama -

Matt Barnes
Columnist

Saddened. Humiliated. Heartbro-
ken. These descriptions would not
‘usually describe an overwhelm-
ingly re-elected governor, po-
tential presidential nominee and
immensely popular politician. Yet,
on the morning of Jan. 9, 2014,
Newjersey Governor Chris Chris-
tie felt these emotions.

During a near two—hour long i

press conference, Christie an-
swered questions and made state-
ments regarding what has come to

I be known as “Bridgegate.”

In mid-September, the Port
Authority of New York and New
Jersey unexpectedly closed two
access lanes on the New Jersey
side of the George Washington

' Bridge, the nation’s busiest bridge.

A massive, week-longtrafﬁc jam
followed, clogging the streets of
nearby Fort Lee, NJ.

Last week, emails were ex-
posed linking Christie’s Deputy
Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly

and Port Authority officials to the

ordeal. Allegedly, the closure was
intended as an act of political re-
venge against Democratic Fort Lee
Mayor Mark Sokolich, who did
not endorse Governor Christie for
re-election.

The story has since spread na-
tionwide, sparking many ques-
tions from all directions. How
much did the governor know?
How could something like this
happen under his watch? How
could he possibly have not been
involved? Isn’t this proof that
Christie is a bully who seeks
destructive revenge against his
opponents? If he didn’t know,
doesn’t this signal incompetent

- leadership?

Because of Christie’s promi-
nence, it is reasonable for-such
an episode to become a national
headline. Elected ofﬁcials should
be held accountable and investi-

gated for any potential criminal

activity, but such inquiries and in-
vestigations should not be formed
onthe grounds of irrational as-
sumption and opportunistic par-
tisanship. ‘ . V

As a seemingly moderate poli-
tician in today’s polarized political
culture, Christie has attracted ad-
versaries who are ready to attack
at the earliest possible chance.
The television media has certainly
had a ﬁeld day with the story. ,

In regard to media coverage
of Bridgegate, some have claimed
it to be disproportionate, com-
pared to scandals under Obama’s
term in ofﬁce, _including ‘Opera-

/tion Fast and Furious, Benghazi,

AP wiretapping and IRS targeting
scandals. Objectively speaking,
statistics prove the aforemen-
tioned notion correct. According
to Scott Whitlock of the Media Re-
search Center, the three networks
devoted 17 times more coverage
to Governor Christie’s Bridgegate
scandal in 24 hours than they did
to President Obam_a’s IRS contro-_
versy over the past six months.

To be fair, controversies such.

as the IRS targeting scandal
eventually matured and revealed
President Obama to be truthful in
his denial of involvement. This is
exactly why Christie critics should
remember the importance of pa-
tience. Because events were al-
lowed to properly transpire, Presi-
dent Obama was able to shed the
controversy ofsuch episodes and
movepast them. Governor Chris-

tie deserves the same treatment.

For those who previously de- T
fended President Obama when ’

Operation Fast and Furious,
Benghazi, AP wiretapping and IRS
targeting scandals were ﬁrst re-
ported but now criticize Governor
Christie, it is terribly hypocritical
to make assumptions at this stage
in the investigation.

Using a double standard in re-
gard to scandal and controversy

is imprudent judgementand ir-

responsible behavior.
Regardless of one’s political
disposition, whether left, right
or moderate, it is always a danger
to draw conclusionsifrom only the
early, often misconstrued, facts.
Rather, it is important to step
back and consider what has trans-

‘ pired: Emails were exposed, the

Port Autho_rity officials involved
resigned and Kelly was ﬁred by the

- governonrhimself. Furthermore,

Christie called a press conference
during which he spent almost two
hours answering questions and
speaking candidly to the public
about the sadness and embarrass-
ment with which the episode has
left him. The governor did not
deny the severity of the matter,
nor did he defend his former aide’s
actions. He vowed to comply with
investigations.and to continue
to do his best as governor of his
state.

A What more do critics want?

Christie has directly addressed.
the issue, ﬁred the staffer involved
- and vowed to comply with fur-

ther investigation. Above all else,
if Christie has, in fact, lied, the

- person most affected would be

himself.

i As ‘former New York City Mayor Rudy
Giuliani said on Sunday’s “This Week” with
George Stephanopoulos, “He says he didn’t
know. I think it’s pretty darn credible. He
wouldn’t make this blanket denial unless
it’s not true.” ‘ ‘ ‘
Moreover, Giuliani made clear that “If,

for some reason, it’s not true, the man has
put. his political career completely at risk.

January 14, 2014 I ThePitt News | \/\'/\/v\/vpiiinevvscom

If it turns out there is some evidence that
he knew about it, he’s taken the complete
risk that his political career is over. I don’t
- think he’d do that if there’s any suggestion
he knew about this.”» .
Governor Christie is a masterful p‘oliti-
cian, as well as a_former U.S. attorney. He
is more aware than anyone of the repercus-
sions lying has on a political career. He
has to understand that if any knowledge
of the scandal exists, it will surface and
become known. Therefore, downright lying

to the public about information that will

surface would be completely inconsistent
with Christie’s blunt manner and political
adeptness.

Instead of speculating on the governor’s
sincerity or impulsively demanding an-

P swers on the spot, the public must take a

rational and patient approach that allows
‘for the facts to rise up and the falsities to
fade away.

If Governor Christie did know about
the motive behind the lane closings, then

if the public has every right to'criticize and
V condemn him for an untruthful response

to an already awful situation. If nothing
comes of the investigation, however, it is the
responsibility of the media and the public
at large to move past the episode and focus

' on the issuesfacing the governor, rather

than the reckless actions of a former staff
member.

Governor Christie deserves a chance,
and in order to provide a respectful ap-
proach to politics and journalism, it is the
nation’s duty to give him one.‘

“Her”

Directed by: Spike Jonze

Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams,
Scarlett Johcznsson '
Grade: A

“Man falls in love with Siri” might sound
like an idea from a scrapped “South Park”
episode, but ignore any reservations about
the premise: “Her” transcends its superﬁ-
cial absurdity to become the most thought-
ful, moving and imaginative major studio
release of 2013 (and now a Golden Globe
winner for Bestscreenplay).

Director Spike Jonze (“Adaptation,”

“Where the Wild Things Are”) has always i

had a penchant for packaging the surreal
into a cinematic universe that is not only
totally believable but always feels bracingly
immediate. Aside from the vibrant ward-
robes and interior designs, futuristic Los
Angeles (which was created by blending

 

   -A‘ v *

shots of modern Los Angeles with shots of
Shanghai) bears few aesthetic differences
to the modern city. Although “Her” may
be set in a plausible and not-so-distant
future, it has just as much to say aboufthe
current state of relationships and personal
disconnect.

In the ﬁxture according to “Her,” hu-
man connection is in a perilous place.
People entrust professionals to pen even
the most personal of messages, including
love letters, birthday wishes andnotes
to their children. One such letter—writer,
Theodore Twombly (a loveably pathetic
Joaquin Phoenix), struggles with the very
affection that he so eloquently expresses
for others. _

Separated from his stone—cold wife
Catherine (Rooney Mara), Twombly con-
stantly seeks ways to ﬁll the void of losing
“someone to share his life with.” After an
attempt to ﬁndpleasure through a pseudo-
Chat Roulette service for single insomniacs
goes (hilariously) wrong, he stumbles on
a far more unorthodox companion: his

operating system, “Samantha” (voiced by
Scarlettjohansson).

Samantha is more patient, understand-
ing, quick-witted and compassionate than
any human being could ever dream to be.
Jonze hardly seems to want Samantha to
come across as eerie or unsettling, despite
her larger-than—Iife ability to process data,

read information and solve abstract phys- .
ics problems, Throughout the ﬁlm, there’s ..

an underlying sense that Samantha and the
other operating systems are growing to be
far II‘l0I‘€p0W€l’f11l than they were intended,
but it doesn’t dominate the thematic tract
of the movie. /

That Jonze doesn’t primarily treat
“Her” as avehicle to condemn technology
and the corporate titans associated with it
islespecially impressive, given how easy it
could have been to bludgeon viewers over
the head with cautionarymessagesqlonze
is far more concerned withthe human than
the machine, and it makes “Her” a truly

.transcendental ﬁlm.
Buoyed by Phoenix and Johansson’s ‘

charming chemistry, the central relation-
ship takes only ’a few minutes to feel as
natural as any other in the ﬁlm, except
for the fact that every exchange bears the
weight of the world.]onze has crafted more

Maintenance, visibility the keys to safe winter biking

Vincent Smith
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

If you plan on riding a bike to commute
this winter, be prepared for a plethora of
remarkably annoying obstacles.

Icy turns, snow—encrusted bike lanes
and the creepy way that cars refuse to pass
you during winter are just thebeginning.
Salt deposits can build up into mounds, es-
sentially becoming speed bumps on a busy
road, and fallen autumn leaves saturate into
tire-imprinted mush, caking the sides of
congested roads right where many cyclists
prefer to ride: In addition, concrete shrinks
in winter, causing potholes to expand and
deepen, turning a jarring bump into a bike
crash waiting to happen. *

Traversing these obstacles while avoid-
ing the sid_e-view mirror of that Volvo pre-
cariously positioned on your left side is by
no means an easy task. And by the way, that
lady in the red Subaru is totally giving you
the ﬁnger.

Riding a bike in winter is different than
in summer e— and far more dangerous —- so
all riders should be prepared for the ‘ele-
ments and the toll that winter can take on
your bike. A

thing works.

“Lubricating parts a lot is really im-
portant,” Lundgren said. “If you have rim
brakes, you want to lubricate the pivots on
those, [as well as] your chain, of course.”

“You just want to clean it up, get all the
salt off,” he said.

According to Lundgren, salt can cause
your bike a lot of trouble in winter by jam-
ming up the works, and it can very well
lead to permanent damage if not properly
handled.

“You actually really need to make sure
you wash off as much salt as you can -— like
every time you ride it,’f he said. “The more
you do it, the better.”

Lundgren also recommends checking
your brakes before every ride, purchasing
bike fenders to avoid excessive road splatter
and ﬁlling up your tires with air every week.
Putting front and back lights on your bike is
also recommended. When roads are icy at
night, other vehicles need as much advance
warning as possible to get around you.

TELEVESIQN

Some little-known  

  independent films
discovered over break  

Andrew Fishman
Staff Wrz'ter

Faced with the freedom to do whatever we
wanted and free of our responsibilities (at
least for three weeks),.winter break was a
great opportunity for many of us to really
ﬁnd ourselves. A '

Most of us didn’t have to look too far,
either. The couch and the bed are just afew
ﬂights of stairs apart.

Though it’s wonderful seeing friends
from high school and spending quality time
with one’s family, I don’t thinkll would be
wrong in saying that a large percentage of
college students spent an equally large per-
centage of their time numbing their already
ﬁnals-killed brains even further by engaging
themselves in quality television watching.

In today’s society, winter-break couch
potatoes (orWBCPs, if you will), ﬁnd them-
selves presented with a far wider variety of
television and movies than what happens
to be on cable at 2 p.m. that day (for no
respectable WBCP dares to wake up before
2 'p.r_n.). If you don’t own a Netﬂix account

' or at least “borroW” the password to an ac-

count owned by your roommate’s brother’s
girlfriend, it’s time to re—evaluate your life.
Netﬂix provides both WBCPS and your
everyday television or movie fan with hun-
dreds of instant options right at their ﬁn-
gertips. As if leaving the house, driving to a
movie theater and paying to watch a movie
wasn’t already about the laziest, yet ex-
tremely fun, activity one could participate
in, Netﬂix allows people to get the same
form of entertainment (and more) without
even leaving his or her house (and for less
money). It really is quite a brilliant idea.
The key to Netﬂix is the aforementioned
hundreds of instant options. Every genre
and subgenre imaginable is well represent-
ed in the movie database, giving viewers an
opportunity to watch a ﬁlm that they didn’t
get the chance to see in theaters, or even
something outside of their comfort zone.
This winter break, I immersed myself
in the world of Netﬂix. I kept a running

list of the movies I watched with the goal
in mind to watch as obscure, yet highly
recommended of a collection of indie mov-
ies as possible. Now that the semester has
started up again and we WBCES have had

our procrastination sessions dut to 2-hour‘

blocks, I’ve narrowed down the list to my
top threefpicks of the break.

“J iro Dreams of Sushi” (David Gelb, 2011)

This documentary that is quickly gain-.

ing a cult following (albeit 3 years after its
release), takes place injapan, and follows
the life of Jim Ono, an 85-year old sushi
master whose highly-‘esteemed restau-

rant has 10 seats and requires a month-

in—advance reservation. The ﬁlm delves
into Jiro’s techniques, family and history,
and provides an eye-opening experience
into the value of work, as well as the craft
of sushi-making.

after a huge forest ﬁre (a seemingly un-
eventful plot in which the two men form a
seemingly unlikely bond). The ﬁlm made its
way around to many ﬁlm festivals in 2013
(including Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Film
Festival) after premiering at the Sundance
Film Festival.

2013)

This increasingly popular documentary
discusses and criticizes SeaWorld — par-
ticularly the theme park’s treatment of its
iconic killer whales .— and examines how
the overall practice of keeping the species in
an unnatural captivity can lead to extremely
violent behavior by the orcas. “Blackﬁsh” is
a haunting, saddening tale of the dangers
of keeping any animal, particularly killer
whales, in an unnatural environment. I

That is ayear-round, universal rule for all
cyclists, but it takes on special signiﬁcance
in winter. When ice is on the ground, driv-
ers are more paranoid. That means that
if you are riding a bike, you are automati-
cally even more of a nuisance to them than
usual. People in cars typically hate people on
bikes. The feeling is generally reciprocated,
but seeing as one group has a 2,0o0—pound
weight advantage over the other, you should
probably swallow your pride and avoid a
crash. ’ ‘

So to avoid altercations, “you have to
make sure you signal your turns,” Lundgren
said. “I see a lot of riders out there not doing
it, and it’s not safe.” F

- The safety of those on bikes is more or
less dependent on the behavior of the drivers

- around them, so cyclists need to do’ every-

thing in their power to follow traffic laws and
avoid confrontations with vehicles. Stop at
red lights, maintain a consistent speed and
try to stay on your side of the lane. When you
hold up your end of the agreement, you have
full rights to yell at drivers when they don’t.

system. Yet through most of the movie and
his relationship with Samantha, he continu-
ously puts off signing divorce papers to end
his failed marriage. “Her” is just as much a
meditation on loss and moving forward in
life. Theodore is hesitant to abandon the sta-
bility and certainty of marriage — even when
the mutual passion is depleted. Though his
affections seem fully invested in Samantha,
the lack of physical connection still crafts
a barrier. _

Samantha develops a wide array of emo-
tions and desires at an alarming rate. As she
grows closer to Theodore, she longs for a
physical form — to walk alongside him, to
scratch her back.,Subtly, Jonze wants us to
consider the ongoing modern dissatisfac-x
tion with appearance and functionality. What
makes Samantha’s desires any different from
those of an unattractive woman who dreams
of beauty? Or a disabled girl who longs for
the ability to walk? .

Sure, the sheer ambition of “Her” may b
what makes it most infatuating at ﬁrst (then
again, “John Carter” was ambitious, too). But
much like Samantha, it’s the ﬁision of heart
and perception that truly makes “Her” one

Onus on Artis, Newkirk

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Over the past decade, Pitt basketball head
coachjamie Dixon has relied on senior play
and leadership year-in and year-out to guide
his teams to the third-best winning percent-
age of any current team in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.

This year is no different, with redshirt
senior forward Lamar Patterson leading the
team in scoring and ball distribution, posting
17.9 points and 4.5 assists per game, ‘while
redshirt senior center Talib Zanna anchors

the paint with 12.4 points and a team-best

eight rebounds per game.

But veteran leadership isn’t the Panthers’
only claim to fame. Over the years, they have
gained a reputation for having a deep bench
that wasn’t going to change this year, with
redshirt sophomore swingman DurandJohn—
son and freshman point guardjosh Newkirk
leading the reserves.

“Both of them are spark plugs off the
bench,” Patterson said, adding that oppos-
ing teams need to, “be ready for Durand and
Josh —— it’s just a different feel.”

After tearing his anterior cruciate liga-
ment (ACL) and meniscus in his right knee
against Wake Forest, Johnson is lost for the
rest of the 2013-2014 season.’

Johnson was the leader of the reserves,
playing 19.8 minutes and scoring 8.8 points
per game.

Newkirk, a freshman, helped assuage
concerns about Pitt’s backcourt depth, play-
ing 14.8 minutes per game in relief of sopho-
more starting point guardjames Robinson.
WithJohnson’s injury, the onus is on fresh-
men Newkirk andjamel Artis to sustain the
bench’s high level of play. _

In last Monday’s 79-59 win against Mary-
land,Johnson scored a career-high 17 points
on 6—of-8 shooting, and Newkirk provided
a valuable 18 minutes off the bench that

included eight points and a pair of assists.
Dixon said Johnson’s performance was a
“great sign of growth and maturity” after
Johnson was limited to eight minutes against
North Carolina State because of the ﬂu.

“He plays hard, and yes, he is going to

make some mistakes,” Dixon said. “He brings
intensity every day when he’s out there, and
that is why he has gotten better. I’m proud
of him andjosh.” 1
Johnson has been a hit—or—miss player ear-
ly for the Panthers,,but his development as an

i . all—around player has helped mask stretches

when he shot 2—of—17 from 3-point range.
- , ‘‘He’s a different player than he was two
years ago,” Dixon said. “I actually said to him

I the other day, ‘Right now, I think that you’re ‘

3”

a rebounder. V 1

Dixon also told Johnson about how he
can do other things to help the team besides
scoring, and it appears the Baltimore, Md.,
product has embraced that ideology. ‘

“Coming off the bench, I just try to play
hard, bring my energy,” Johnson said. 5‘I
know the guys kind of look at me to bring
that energy, to be the energy man.”

And despite Dixon’s perceptions,Johnson
isn’t gun-shy when it comes to taking looks
at the basket from 3—point‘range'— which
may partially explain his below-average 33.8

' percent clip from beyond the arc.

“As a shooter, it’s just conﬁdence,”John-_
son said. “You’ve always got to know the next a

shot is going in no matter if you miss. I just try
to stay conﬁdent, and my teammates found
me, and I was able to make shots tonight.”

Johnson’s conﬁdence should be his most
valuable asset as he rehabilitates his knee
over the next 9 to’ 12 months.

As for Dixon’s conﬁdence in Newkirk,
it seems to grow with each game. In turn,
Newkirk’s own conﬁdence in himself grows,

I‘ as well.
L “It means a lot, it gives me a big conﬁ-
dence boost,”Newkirksaid. “I like being able

to bring that energy.” ~ J
Withjohnson out, Newkirk’s level of play
must boost with his conﬁdence.
What has convinced Dixon, to play
Newkirk nearly 15 minutes per game is the
emergence of his shooting ability, which sur-

prised not only his coach but also Dixon’,s/,

~ former boss.

well from the start. Probably a better shooter
than I anticipated coming,” Dixon said. “[For—
mer Pitt head basketball coach] Ben Howland
was here, and he was surprised at how good
a shooter he was.”

Newkirk showed off his shot, which he
says has “deﬁnitely” improved, in the season’s
ﬁrst game Nov. 8, 2013, when he made three
of three 3-pointers against Savannah State.

“[I’ve] just been in the gym working, get-
ting better,” Newkirk said.

N ewkirk’s shooting must continue to im-
prove over the rest of the season. He and
Robinson are tied for third on the team with
eight 3—pointers made this season. Ahead of
them sitjohnson with 22 3-pointers made
and Patterson with a team—high 31 triples.

.“He’s a great kid,” Dixon said of N ewkirk.
“He listens and wants to get better.”

Pitt Panthers have an opportunity to start
conference play with four straight wins for

That year, the Panthers attained both a No.

No. 22 Pitt (15—1, 3—oACC) is one of three

Maryland and Wake Forest by an average
of nearly 16 points per game. Georgia Tech
(10-26, 1-2 ACC) last beat Notre Dame at
home, 74-69, for its ﬁrst conference win
of the season.

The Panthers are led by a pair of red-
shirt seniors in forward Lamar Patterson
and Talib Zanna. Patterson averages team
highs in points and assists at 17.9 and 4.5
per game, respectively, and he has poste
six 20-point games this season. ‘

sive ‘attack with three players averaging

   

A double—digit point totals. Senior guard Trae

Golden leads the Yellow Jackets, with 13.1

points per game, and he scored‘20 points ’

on 8—of—11 shooting in his last game against
the Fightinglrish. ,

Sophomore forward Marcus Georges-
Hunt pairs with Golden in the backcourt-
and averages 11.9 points per game.

‘In the frontcourt, Georgia Tech is ‘led *

by hulking Daniel Miller’s 10.4 points and
8.2 rebounds per game. The 6—foot-11,
275—pound seniorlfrom Loganville, Ga.,
will test Pitt’s frontcourt as one of the larg-
est post players the Panthers have seen
this season. 1

But the Yellowjackets, like the Panthers,
were bit hard by the injury bug as leading
rebounder Robert Carter Jr. tore his me—
niscus Dec. 29 against Charlotte and will
miss the remainder of the season. Carter
was nearly averaging a double-double at
10.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per game in
the 13 contests he played prior to his injury.

Pitt plays the rest of its season without
fourth—leading scorer Durand Johnson,
who tore his right ACL and meniscus in
the Panthers’ last game against Wake For-
est. Johnson was scoring 8.8 points per
game in 16 games off the bench.lE

Artis generally comes olf the bench to

   

spell fellow freshman Michael Young, but the .

two will now ﬁnd themselves playing more
minutes together with,Artis needed to ﬁll
the minutes at the small forward position
made available by Johnson’s injury. But for
the player who says he “doesn’t even look
at stats,” positional labels are just as incon-
sequential.

“I just play basketball,” Artis said. ‘‘What— ‘

ever’s open for me, I try to get my teammates
open. I try to get an offensive rebound, or it’s
shooting the ball. I just play basketball”!
