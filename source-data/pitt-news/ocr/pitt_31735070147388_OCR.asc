WANNSTEDT RESIGNS 

Jamie Martina I Assistant Visual Editor

Pitt football players surround Dave Wannstedt in an emotional show of support at last night’s press conference in the South Side.

Staff Report

In three short months, head football coach
Dave Wannstedt fell from his position as
the Big East’s predicted champion to its
latest coaching casualty, announcing his
resignation under pressureat the South
Side yesterday.

“It just seemed to be the right time,”
Athletic Director Steve Pederson said at an
emotional press conference, providing no
clear details about why Wannstedt decided
to resign now in particular.

Rumors that Wannstedt would resign or
had been ﬁred circulated throughout the

day on Facebook, Twitter and several news
outlets. After the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette
reported that Pederson would meet with
Wannstedt, conversation erupted on social

‘media sites and “Wannstedt” became one

of the top trending topics on Twitter.

Pitt remained mum until an evening
press conference, at which it announced
that Wannstedt will “remain at Pitt in the
capacity of special assistant to the athletic
director.” _ .

When Wannstedt walked into the room,
much of the football team applauded the
six—year coach and walked to stand by his
side. - -

“I had a few things to say,” Wannstedt
said, “but I_think that says it all.” -

Wannstedt reﬂected on his years at
the program.

“I appreciate the opportunity from
Mark Nordenberg and this University to
come here andwin games and most impor-
tantly try and make a difference in these
young men’s lives,” he said.

He then took the team for a private V
‘meeting.

Pederson addressed the media.

“It made the most sense to do it now,”
he said of replacing Wannstedt as coach.
“If you’re going to do it at the end of the
season, then you need to do it so you can
get after the next phase of the program:

About an hour before head football
coach Dave Wannstedt officially an-
nounced his resignation at a press con-
ference in the South Side yesterday,
students were already discussing his
departure across campus and on so-
cial networking sites like Twitter and
Facebook. p

Many were happy with the news that
Wannstedt would not return for a sev-
enth season. Many were not.

Tom Crowther, a sophomore, heard
the news at Market Central while watch-
ing ESPN. He said that at one moment,
it was announced that Wannstedt would
meet with Pitt officials, and then “10
minutes later, it was like boom — he’s
out.” ‘ ‘

“I think it’s sad. He was an ambas-
sador to the University and a good re-
cruiter,” Crowther said.

Crowther believes the Pitt football
team lost some games it shouldn’t have,
but there might be instability now that

‘Wannstedt is out. The football .team’s

record this season was 7-5 overall, 5-2
in the Big East.

“He was the best coach we had in
the past 20 years. We finally won 10
games last year —— he’s made us relevant

CORRECTION:

An article in yesterday’s paper, “Trustees approve pay hikes,” incorrectly stated that Chancellor Mark Nordenberg andother officials will
receive raises next ﬁscal year._The oﬂicials will actually receive raises this ﬁscal year. The article also incorrectly stated that salaries of other
Pitt employees will be discussed next summer. They were actually discussed last summer. The Pitt News regrets the errors.

‘Dead week’ not so dead

Emily Marmion
C For The Pitt News

At some universities, the week before
ﬁnals is declared “dead,” meaning pro-
fessors are not allowed to assign tests or
papers in order to give students ample
time to prepare for the semester’s end.

But here at Pitt, some students report-
ed being bogged down with papers and
exams this week, whereas others do have
somewhat of a dead week, allowing them
to begin studying for ﬁnal exams.

Although Pitt will administer a final
examination period, starting this Monday,
many professors do not follow this policy,
and some faculty are largely unsympa-
thetic to student complaints.

Laura Dice, Arts and Sciences assistant
dean and director of freshman programs,
said the amount of work students have the
week before ﬁnals is their own fault.

“Students leave their work to the last
minute,” Dice said.

Whether the stress is the result of ir-
responsibility or an overload of assign-
ments, the decisions professors make
during the run-up to finals are highly
calculated, administrators and instruc-
tors say.

Patrick Altdorfer, a political science
adviser, said that the amount of work
professors issue during the week prior
to ﬁnals depends on how much of the syl-
labus they cover during the duration of
the semester.

Altdorfer said that students might
falsely think their professors are “letting
up” during the week before ﬁnals when
professors do not successfully get through
all of the assignments on the syllabus.

The ones who don’t let up often issue
tests instead.

Biological Studies adviser Christine
Berliner said that some professors give
out tests the week before ﬁnals to see if
their students know the information from
the last portion of the ‘semester.

Many students in the Biological Studies
Department, as well as in other depart-
ments, ﬁnd this system unfair.

Sophomore Julia Glick said, “I have
papers and exams in two classes that I will
also have ﬁnals for next week. I do think
that teachers who give ﬁnals during ﬁnals
week should not give exams and papers
during the last week of classes.”

Glick said she has four papers as well
as two exams this week. She also has four
ﬁnals next week. ' V

Students said that an authenticated
dead week would give them an opportunity
to perform better on their ﬁnals.

Sophomore Samantha Segraves said
she would use the extra time from a dead
week to study for ﬁnals.

Dice said that the University should
enforce the policy that professors must
give ﬁnals only during ﬁnals week.

Many students and faculty believe that
an overarching dead week implemented by
the University might be a bad idea.

Altdorfer said professors should be
permitted to enact their own syllabi and
doesn’t believe a dead week is neces-
sary. ,.

“Isn’t that what spring break is for?”
Altdorfer asked. '

Glick said if a teacher assigns a test the
week before the ﬁnal examination period,
in lieu of a ﬁnal exam, she doesn’t mind.

“I don’t mind having half of the work
due this week, so I am not completely dead

for ﬁnals week,” she said.

Whatever their opinion on a dead week,
many Pitt students will be busy prepar-
ing for the ﬁnal examination period this
weekend. ,

Although senior Liam Sweeney said
he considers his week to be somewhat
dead, he has two exams and three papers,
amounting to'about 100 pages, due next
week.

But Sweeney said the ﬁnals workload
does not bother him.

“It separates the mice from the men,”
Sweeney said. '

A collaboration of 45 nonproﬁt groups,
including Pitt, has pledged to commit a
total of $5.2 million to Pittsburgh over
the next two years, enough to aid but not
entirely balance the city’s budget.

Neither Pitt nor CMU would reveal
exactly how much of the $5.2 million in
PSF donations they will contribute to
aid the city. ' -

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl has repeatedly
said that the next few years will be critical
to Pittsburgh’s ﬁnancial stability, and this
Public Service Fund is one of manyideas
to raise money to balance the city budget
and keep Pittsburgh ﬁscally sound.

The fund also includes Carnegie Mel-
lon University and Highmark Health
Care.

These nonproﬁts. along with Pitt,
pledged to help Ravenstahl come up with
solutions to ease the city’s ﬁnancial woes
because his “fair share” tax proposal was
rejected last year.

The tuition tax would have raised
money to balance a $15 million hole in
the city budget by adding an additional
1 percent tax to college students in the
Pittsburgh community.

not require extra direct contributions
from students. It relies solely on dona-
tions from nonproﬁts that are willing to
contribute to the city.

“All the contributions from the non-
proﬁts are voluntary and will go to the
city’s General Operating Budget,” said
Reynolds Clark, co—chair of the PSF and
a Pitt vice chancellor for community ini-
tiatives. ‘ I

According to Kenneth Service, execu-
tivedirector of the Pittsburgh Council on
Higher Education, which is comprised of
the 10 accredited universities and col-
leges in the Pittsburgh Area, there is a

$15 million plug in this years budget that
says “Public Service'Fund.”

’ But the PSF has only pledged $2.6 mil-
lion for 2010 and $2.6 million for 2011,
so it is clear that the PSF will not balance
the entire budget. 

Dan Gilman, chief of staff for Council-
man Bill Peduto said, “We have a number
of dollars that we can move around to
close gaps  But you can only do that
for so long before eventually there’s a
long-term problem to address. If we don’t

ﬁnd a solution, there will be no dollars to A

shift around and we will be in a financial
crisis.” ‘

Ravenstahl was not available for com-
ment on these issues. l

Clark did say that Pitt gave signiﬁ-
cantly larger contributions to the new
PSF than it had provided to the PSF that
existed between 2005-07 -and that Pitt,
CMU and Highmark would be “major
contributors.” .

The original Public Service Fund in-
cluded more than 100 nonproﬁts.

Clark said only 45 of these 100 non-
proﬁts in the current budget are making
contributions to the city budget, partly
because the funds are-voluntary and
partly because the budgets of nonprof-
its are now constrained because of the
economy. '

“These nonproﬁts have less discre-
tionary dollars to donat_e,” Clark said.
“These are precious dollars, you have
to understand. The nonprofits are do-
ing this as an expression of cooperation
to the city because they understand the
importance of Pittsburgh being a ﬁscally
sound city.”

It is unclear whether or not Ravenstahl
will ask for more donations or help from
the PSF in the future. V - ‘ . '

Clark said, “It is not reasonable to
expect any increase in donations toward

Lame —duck SGB holds last meeting of the year

President Charlie Shull and Board members finish out the year with final allocations and recommendations for new Board

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

The atmosphere was jovial for "much of
last night’s SGB meeting — the final
Tuesday night installment for the lame-
duck Board. ' '

President Charlie Shull called the
meeting to order shortly before 9 p.m.,
wielding his wooden gavel for the last
time. _ 3

It took him longer than usual to quiet
the roomful of Board members, commit-

tee chairs and student leaders eager to .

defend their allocations requests.

“Despite the tone of this meeting, so
far I’m taking this very seriously, and we
need less chatter from the audience,”
Shull said after whacking his gavel on
the long wooden table set up in Room
630 of the William Pitt Union.

The Board could not meet in its usual
spot — Nordy’s Place —— because the
room was occupied by other student
groups. -

When the room ﬁnally quieted, Board
members and committee chairs ‘made
their regular reports.

Board member David Petrone men-

. tioned a planned “Black Out Day” to be .

observed on campus in February.

The day will honor students and com-
munity members who have been killed
by drunk driving accidents. '

Board member Kieran O’Leary an-
nounced that the new Student Affairs
website will be up and running in the
near future, whereas academic affairs
chair and Board member—elect Alex Zim-
merman gave an update on his work ex-
panding the number of classes that meet
general education requirements.

Zimmerman said he will meet with

the Arts and Sciences Undergraduate
Council on.Friday to formally present
his research and recommendations.

Other business discussed by various
committee chairs included the planned
return of the Blue, Gold and Green Sus-
tainability Festival to be held next se-
mester as well as the installment of the
first Student Sustainability Project.

As a part of the project,’ Pitt main-
tenance crews installed new aerators
on sinks in the bathrooms of six Tower
C floors. .

The aerators are meant to save up to
77 percent of water usage in the sinks,

and more are slated to be installed
throughout Tower C if the project proves
successful.

The Board also announced that Friday
will be the last allocations meeting of
the semester.

Any organizations with pressing al-
locations requests should get them in
as soon as possible. .

At the end of the meeting, Shull made
an appeal to next year’s Board and the
Pitt student body to stay active in civic
processes ——. speciﬁcally byattending

next year’s Pitt Day in Harrisburg.

“In the face of further and deeper
cuts in state and federal allocations
as stimulus funding runs out we could
realistically see huge hikes in tuition
next year,” Shull said. “I’ve heard from

other state-relatedlschools, and they’re- A
in similar situations. Keeping an eye on
and protecting students from increas-

ing financial burdens is going to bethe
most important work the Board does
next year.” V

Shull also passed along a number of
recommendations for next year’s Board,
including a motion to enact ethics re-
forms and committee chair performance
reviews. I -

“A predominant feeling among the

Dave Wannstedt

makes a good call

It’s hard to argue with a standing ovation.

Since the Pitt football team chose to give
head coach Dave Wannstedt one last night
when he announced his resignation, it’s clear
Wannstedt was no minor blip in Panther
football history. In fact, most of his time
at the helm was a spot of light among two
decades of mediocrity — he won’t be re-
membered just for his mustache.

In more ways than one, he was a great
face for the program. Whereas past coaches
couldn’t mesh as well with the team, Wannst-
edt clearly commanded the respect of the
players and enthusiastically engaged with
the press. And who could forget the Back-
yard Brawl on Dec. 1, 2007, the day when
unranked Pitt knocked No. 2 West Virginia
out of its assured BCS Championship Game
by beating it 13-9.

But given his record over the past six
years, it’s also hard to argue with Wannst-
edt’s decision to step down. It’s time to move
on.

Sure, the Panthers’ disappointing past
season can be traced to many factors, but in
the end someone must be held accountable.
Especially considering the potential the last
two years presented, Wannstedt fumbled the
opportunity, consistently losing the chance
to get Pitt into a BCS bowl. Heading afootball

team that was once picked to stomp all over
the Big East, Wannstedt lost all ﬁve of this
season’s important games, and he did it all
on national television.

The issues with Wannstedt were more

speciﬁc, too. When situations allowed him '

to take risks, he was too conservative. Worse
still, he was predictable in his conservatism
—— on third and 10, he’d pass the ball one yard
instead of_ trying something more daring.
And even though Pitt offers prospective play-
ers a top-notch professional stadium to play
in, Wannstedt still had difﬁculty recruiting
cohesive, talented teams.

As Wannstedt transitions into a different
position within the athletic department, who

' will take his coaching job? As they make
. their choice, the chancellor and athletic di-
rector should look for a collegiate coach, ‘

someone carrying a history of success and
someone who’s gutsy enough to go deep on
third down. And most importantly, it should
be a coach who can ﬁnally bring Pitt to a Big
East Championship game, preferably next

year before No. 3 Texas Christian University»

enters the conference in 2012 and changes
the playing ﬁeld.

If you disagree with us, you might ﬁnd it
appealing to express your support for Coach
Wannstedt by growing a mustache.

personalized homepage any given day of
thesweek, and instead of news headlines or
weather forecasts, you’ll ﬁnd three horo-
scopes: one for love, one for every Aquarius
and one personalized by my exact birth-
day. ‘ '

I know what you’re thinking: There’s no
way-my horoscopes come true every day.
You would be right. My love horoscope is
boundless with its relationship advice —-
although for what relationship, I don’t know
—— and my other horoscopes are always ex-
ceptionally vague, suggesting that I ‘follow
my star” and “put faith in my intuition.”
Dangerously, it often suggests that I “listen
to my heart and not my head” a convenient
excuse for lying in bed and spending six
hours watching “30 Rock” instead of, you
know, doing my homework or something.
If my heart and my horoscope told me to do
it, I can’t be heldresponsible. It’s destiny or
something, right? '

Even though both my head and heart
tell me that my horoscope is full of lies —— I
mean, sometimes the predictions are even
misspelled —-— I keep reading each day, and
not just because it’s entertaining. At most I
might only half-believe it, but I read them be-
cause astrology creates the perception that
I am a part of great forces in the universe,
forces that operate like clockwork. There’s
less gray area than in religion because mo-

‘ lrality doesn’t come into play -— there’s no
“wrong” sign to be and no penalties for .

questioning its accuracy. It’s a nice little
safety blanket under which it’s impossible
to do wrong.

Astrology began with the Babylonians
and was later taken up by the Greeks, who
passed it on to Baghdad and Damascus. It
lost its appeal for most of the world during
the Scientiﬁc Revolution but continued to
thrive in India, where some still believe aus-
picious signs to be necessary before making
important life decisions such as getting mar-
ried. The 20th century saw a rekindling of
interest in astrology — more self-indulgent
than serious. ,

Unscientiﬁc and self-indulgent as it might

be, astrologers are still employed. People like
to read their horoscopes for the reassuring
hints of destiny and character — which, as
Daniel Cohen observed in the Chicago Tri-
bune in 1968, is glorifying: “Who can object
to a ﬂattering description of themselves?
One astrologer told me that under my hard
exterior I was a sensitive person. How was
I to refute a statement like that? Could I say,
‘No, I am really a hardheaded c1od’?”

Astrology is so vague that it points out
characteristics that are more or less present
in most people -— things like having a shell at
times or liking certain amounts of attention
from others. For instance, as an Aquarius,
some of mytraits include creativity and a
strong attachment to my friends. Because
I like these traits, I am more than willing
to recognize them in myself, even though
it’s perfectly human to be a loyal friend,
and almost everyone on the planet ismore
or less a creative thinker in some capacity.
Whether I capitalize on these traits more
because I know I’m supposed to have them
is another question — which came ﬁrst, the
zodiac sign or the character trait?

Either way, I’m attracted to astrology be-

‘silly’ astrology can promote introspection

cause it encourages us to recognize qualities
within ourselves we would be less aware of
without some sort of medium to illuminate
them.

Surely, it’s too New Age-y to say thatour
personalities or destinies are contrived by
the planets or by the signs we’re born under.
But I like to read my horoscope because it
encourages meto examine my day and look
for signs connecting me to some larger order
— even if it’s just the larger human order.
It’s the same reason I like to read books or
listen to music. Sharing in an experience — a
ﬁctional character’s plot line or an Aquarius’
personality traits — keeps me from feeling
alone and lets me know that there are oth-
ers out there like me. Whether or not that’s
because we were born under the same sign
is debatable.

So I think that believing too much in as-
trology is silly. I mean, predetermination in
most capacities just turns out to be a con-
venient excuse, a way to avoid the elfort of
further investigation. But where’s the harm
in a little daily introspection? —

Wow a portal into complexsociety

Michael Macagnone
Contributing Editor

Surrounded by hundreds of people at the bot-
tom of the ocean, Pitt senior Charles Hughes
tried to pick up a shell for about 15 minutes. He
died three times in the process.

The shell was not real —— it was constructed
from pixels. Hughes, an industrial engineering
major, sat safe and dry in his chair the entire
time. It was his avatar, a humanoid bull called a
Tauren, that ﬂoated lifelessly in the water each
time, waiting for its soul to return to its body.

The clacks of the keyboard and click of the
mouse ﬁlled Hughes’ bedroom as he and his
friends worked their way through World of
Warcraft, the world’s largest multiplayer online
role—playing game.

In World of Warcraﬁ, players create their
own character in a real-time fantasy world —
magic spells and all —— with thousands of other
players on each server. Characters level up and
improve their abilities, allowing players to take
on more difficult challenges that include human
opponents and computer-controlled monsters.
The game often encourages and even requires
cooperation with other players, as many of the
game’s achievements are impossible alone.

According to its manufacturer, Blizzard En-
tertainment, the game was released almost six
years ago and just passed 12 million subscribers
a few months ago. At midnight on Monday on
the West Coast, Blizzard launched its newest
expansion, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. So
for Hughes and everyone else who bought their
games at midnight on the East Coast, that meant
a three—hour wait to begin playing. That was
after Hughes had lined up two hours early in the
20 degree night, amidst wind and snow.

He described himself — while standing
outside of the Gamestop on Forbes Avenue in
a parka — as something between a casual and
hardcore player.

“I’ve put my hours in,” he said. “But I’ll
slow down depending on the time of year and
schoolwork.”

Once the game launched, it took another half
an hour for Hughes and his friends —— includ-
ing his brother —— to log on to the game and
get organized.

Out of his friends, Hughes was the first
to sign on his server, one of more than 100
game worlds populated by thousands of play-
ers each.

His armor-clad Tauren warrior, named
Momingstare, lumbered around the fantasy
world ofAzeroth while hundreds of other play-
ers streamed by him in the city.

Trying to pass some time, Hughes took a
quest —— an optional task for players — that ‘
involved picking ﬂowers.

“Great. Nobody is in except this one guy

named Chuck who’s running around picking

Pitt senior Charles Hughes plays the new World of Warcraft expansion w

ﬂowers,” his friend Wally Khuze — whom
Hughes knows only through WOW — said over
their voice chat.

In another few minutes the group made
its way over to a boat loaded with hundreds of
players that seemed as if it would take them to
an entirely new zone. V.

Once there, halfa dozen tentacles reared up
over the boat, threatening to pull it down into
the ocean. Ifplayers didn’t jump from the boat
at the right time, the Kraken, a sea monster,
threw them into another zone to take the boat
andtry again. '

The success of the game has turned it into
a cultural phenomenon — garnering an ap-
pearance on “South Park” —— and raised con-
cerns about safety and addiction for some of
its players.

“When I say addiction, I mean it in the col-
loquial sense,” said Bonnie Nardi, an anthro-

pologist at the University of California-Irvine,
who has studied social interactions in the game
for the past ﬁve years. “Addiction is a medical
condition, and whether that exists for some,
we don’t know yet.”

In her experience with playing and studying
the game, people who are playing too much are
generally able to correct it for themselves.

Hughes — still intently playing just aﬁzer 5
a.m. —— agreed.

“Its all about knowing your limitations,” he

said. “If you do it too much or do it when you ‘I

shouldn’t, then it’s a problem.” ‘

He said he stopped playing for more than a
weekbeforethe release. He had run all ofthe in-
stances — parts of the game world with bosses
and other challenges — and didn’t have much
interest in player—versus-player competition.

But before heading to GameStop Monday
night, Hughes picked up an energy drink so

he could settle down for the long haul with
his new game.

A little after4 a.m., the group moved into in-
stances. Hughes, used to tanking —- or playing
a protector role in the game — in the highest
level instances of the last game, was slowed
down by the cautious pace of the dungeon.

“It’s about this time people start waking
up and I need to pay attention to the outside
world,” Khuze said. - ~

Hughes wanted to play all night Monday,
and into Tuesday. He said he’d be able to bal-
ance it. ‘

Nardi, who also wrote the book “My Life
as a Night Elf Priest” about her time playing
the game, said that players’ guilds —— semi-
permanent organizations of players — will

MUSIC COLUMN

Neutral Milk Hotel the forefathers ofindie

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

I always tend to listen to music in cycles. I’ll listen
to one group consistently for a while, get inter-
ested in somethingvaguely related, then return
to the original group worthy of my affections
just every once in a while after. An amateur his-
tory buff, I tend to channel that vaguely related

_ category intothe seminalmusiciansthatinspired

the artistic ﬁre of my favorite bands. _

With myﬁrst musical love, punk rock, itwent
all the way back to the Velvet Underground’s
transcendental atmosphere. With my later high
school musical interests inagenrelstillﬁnd hard

' to deﬁne — indie mck — my research went back

to a group who channeled three chords of noisy
folk into magic. Before there could be anArcade
Fire or Good Net:/sfor People IV/Jo Love Baa’Neu/5,
there had to be Neutral Milk Hotel.

Though you could argue all day about who
created the now Grammy—winning and Platinum-
selling genre of indie rock, it came out oftwo con-
ditions: the demise of alternative rock’s integrity
with music fans —— as the industry marketed that
genre into oblivion -4 and an increasing interest
among musicians insound outside of its rather
rigid conﬁnes. ' ' '

Neutral Milk Hotel’s plaid shirt-clad leader

Jeff Mangum certainly channeled those ideas

when he founded the group as essentially a solo
projectinthe early 1990s, releasing cassette tapes
that combined auditory art with his seemingly
simple songs. The Louisiana native eventually
moved his recording toward more conventional
releases with an unset full band, producing an
EP entitled Ewart/ying I: in 1994 and an album
entitled On Azzegr Irkma’ in 1996.

These releases featirre rays ofNIangum’s con-
nective songwriting. The Ewgrt/2z'ngI.rtitle trackis
adistorted burst ofKinl<s’ melodywithanavant—
garde backbeat, whereas “Song Against Sex’?
from On/lmy Irkma’ is achugging rock number
propelled by two guitars and a trombone solo.
Each has lyrics that are introspectively free-as-
sociative while Mangum’s articulate voice propels

these early creations, each seems to be held back

strum ofhis acoustic guitartothe warbly croon of
his voice, it’s easy to tell that Neutral Milk Hotel
moved somewhere few had ventured. Lyrically,
while describing domestic quarrel, the song’s
speaker delivers dynamite pieces of perspective.

“I sank into your soul / Into that secret place

where no one dares to go,” the lyrics read.

The sixth track on the album, “Holland,
1945,” isn’t just Neutral Milk Hotel’s mostfamous
single song, but also one of the clearest indicators
to the albLun’s underlying lyrical theme: the life of
Anne Frank. “The only girll ever loved / wasbom
with roses in her eyes / But then they buried her
alive / one evening 1945,” the lyrics read.

After Mangum introduces hirnselfwith a
count olf, Barnes’ hypnotic intensity on the
drums and the rest of the group’s orchestrated
grid of overwhelming colorﬁrl noise takes his
song from the earth into the stratosphere.

As the music is delivered in some form of
raw feeling, the lyrics spring from the track like
petals from a ﬂower, constantly reminding the
listener ofhuman emotion. Each perfect morsel
connects in away that not only reminds you of
Anne Frank’s story, but of your own.

Shortly after Neutral Milk Hotel completed
the tourinsupport of In tbe/lerrphrze Owrt/ye Sea,
the band broke up. As is often the case, increas-
ing stress over its success was too much for the
group and particularly for Mangum, who has
made sporadic live appearances and released a

few low-key albums. The other members have
moved on to other musical careers. _

In t/ye Aengpkme Over 2.‘/ae’Sea is probably con-
sidered a masterpiece by those mildly preten-
tious music lovers in your life, but beyond what
the admittedly hip have to say, it’s a great album
and Neutral Milk Hotel remains more than the
Abraham of some musical hipster religion. As
indie rock dominates the world, new listeners
continue to ﬂock toward one of the originators,

Jeff Mangum, and his sound that launched a
thousand Pitchfork reviews.

Gilt suggestion:

Rather than searching for a perfect new CD
or concert ticket for that special someone this
holiday season, maybe you should look for a
musical gift in the form of the “obsolete” vinyl
format. The 33.5 RPM record has gotten its sec-
ond wind as amateur audiophiles have clamored _
in the last few years for its authentic sound and -
more substantial artwork. Record players can’
still be found for relatively cheap at most ﬂea
markets, but even without these devices the re-
cords themselves are great giﬁs, whatever your
budget. Classic rock staples (Black Sabbath, The
Rolling Stones) and indie releases (Neutral Milk
Hotel) cansometimes cost more than anew CD. '
However, used records easilyfound at many local
music shops for less than $5 can offer a diverse
set of quirky musical (and visual) experiences to
whomever might be on your list. I

Here are some highlights from Wannst-

Overall record: 42-31
Big East record: 19-16 »
Bowl record: 1-1

zoos (5-6, 4-3 Big East)

The Wannstedt era at Pitt began with a
subpar season. But that wasto be expected,
as Wannstedt wasn’t leftwith much taleniiut
his disposal after Walt Harris departed.

ESPN’s College GameDay came to Heinz
Field for the much-hyped season open-
ing game between Pitt and Notre Dame. It
was the ﬁrst game as head coach for both
Wannstedt and Notre Dame’s Charlie Weiss.
Weiss’ Irish won the game 42-21, but he
would ultimately be ﬁred in 2009.

2006 (6-6, 2-5 Big East)

Wannstedt began his second season 6-1
and it looked like the Panthers had a bowl
berth locked up. Butthe team lost its ﬁﬁiil
ﬁve games, and the .500 Panthers were left
out of the postseason.

Yet the season will forever be remem-
béred for the Darelle Revis 73-yard punt
return against West Virginia. Not only did

’ Revis juke and weave_his way into the end

zone for the score, but it was all made pos-
sible by a bone-crushing block from Pitt’s
Derek Kinder that took out two ,Mountaine'er
defenders. The play was voted by ESPN as
the 2006 College Football Play of the Year.

If there is one fond memory that all
Panther fans will have of theiywannstedt
era, it will be evoked simplyby the phrase

down as Wannstedt’s biggest win as Pitt’s
coach.

2008 (9-4, 5-2 Big East)
Wannstedt took the Panthers to their

. ﬁrst bowl game since 2004 after posting

a 9-3-regular—seas0n record. The season
included a marathon four-overtime win at
Notre Dame and a 19-15 win over West Vir-
ginia at Heinz Field.

The Panthers would ultimately lose to
Oregon State, 3-0, in one of the most boring

. bowl gamesin .the..history of bowl games,
but at least the4Pant'hers were back in the

postseason.

2009 (10-3, 5-2 Big East)

The Panthers only lost three games and
all three were by one touchdown or less -
two of them were by less than a ﬁeld goal.
And Pitt again defeated rival Notre Dame in
a primetime matchup late in the season.

Wannstedt capped it off with a 19-17 win
over North Carolina in the Meineke Car Care
Bowl. The 10 —win season was the ﬁrst time
the Panthers reached double digits in the

Maybe the expectations for the Pitt foot-
ball team were a little too high. Perhaps

the Panthers had more rebuilding to do ‘

than most people anticipated.

In a year where basically every expert
picked Pitt to go to a BCS bowl and some
even thought the team wouldn’t lose a
Big East game, the Panthers finished 7-5
overall and 5-2 in the conference.

That’s a three~way tie for first place
with Connecticut and West Virginia, but
it’s the Huskies who will wrap up the year
where Pitt fans thought their team would
be playing —— in the Fiesta Bowl.

So where did it all go wrong? What
did everyone overlook?

First, replacing Bill Stull. You wouldn’t
know it for the amount of “boo”s and “We
want Tino!” chants that ﬂoated from the
Heinz Field student section, but Stull
was the first quarterback to lead a Pitt
team to 10 wins since the Dan Marino
era. Last season he threw for 2,633 yards

. and 21 touchdowns, with only nine in-.
terceptions. '

At the end of the season, he was named
to the All-Big East first team. And per-
haps more important than all of that,

Stull was the unquestionable leader of '

his football team. The players said it,
the coaches said it, Stull said it —- there
was no doubt. ‘
So say what you want about Stull, but
that kind of leader is hard to replace right
away, especially with a redshirt sopho-
more who never played any extended
time at the collegiate level. Tino Sunseri
definitely improved as the year went on
and I, for one, am looking forward to
watching him develop throughout his
career. But it’s hard to start your career
on a high note with an opening game
against Utah and one soon after against

game play  

with purchase of 8510 game play

Perhaps this Pitt team had too many holes that weovelrlooked

Miami.
Here’s another reason the Panthers

.. , fell short of expectations: They really

missed tight ends Dorin Dickerson, an
All—Big East ﬁrst team selection, and Nate
Byham, an‘All-Big East second team se-
lection, more than fans anticipated.
Pitt missed Byham’s blocking ability
and Dickerson’s, well, everything. In his
second season at tight end, he had 45
receptions for 508 yards and was named
an Associated Press All-American.
Also, the offensive line lost three
starters last season and Pitt’s struggles
to replace Rob Houser, ﬁrst team All-Big
East right guard, John Malecki and four-
year starterjoe Thomas were obvious —

especially in the early going — and had a A

lot to do with Dion Lewis’ struggles.

Lewis, with the exception of the last
game of the season against Cincinnati,
never really seemed to get going this year.
At least not in the way many expected
from a sophomore starting the season
on the Heisman watch list.

The Panthers also implemented two

, new starting cornerbacks, Antwuan Reed

and Ricky Gary, and both interior defen-
sive linemen were first-time starters.

Defensively, Pitt missed Co—Big East De— .

fensive Player of the Year Mick Williams
and All-Big East first team performer
Adam Gunn. '

So maybe Pitt ‘did start the season fac-
ing too-high of expectations. Maybe we
were all blinded by the promise of of-
fensive stars in Dion Lewis andjonathan
Baldwin, so much so that we ignored some
obvious holes in this football team.

Off the ﬁeld problems — both injuries
and legal issues —— didn’t help. It’s nearly
impossible to replace a player like injured
Greg Romeus, the Co-Big East Defensive
Player of the Year last season, both as a
performer and _a leader. '

It often seemed like leadership was
what these Panthers lacked most. I
