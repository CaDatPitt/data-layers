. Committee
To Concentrate
On Lobbying _  

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

In an uncontested election,
junior Jeff Miller was named
chairman last week of the Student
Government Board’s Public and
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee.

Miller worked as an intern
during the last term in Harrisburg
for James Manderino, D-West-
moreland, state house majority
leader. ‘

“My whole aim as chairman will
be to develop student interests
politically,” Miller said in an
interview last night. "

‘‘We’re going to concentrate on
things we do best,” he added.

Miller stated the areas in which
the committee has operated effi-
ciently over the past term are
lobbying, and inter-university and
intra-university relations. . ‘-

'By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Conney M. Kimbo, newly-
appointed vice chancellor for
student affairs is anxious to move
ahead on the Student Union
renovation project and will submit
a list of his recommendations to the
chancellor within the next several
weeks.

Kimbo assumed office Feb. 19
after a seven-month search for a
replacement for Alfred Moye who
resigned the position last year to
become deputy commissioner of
the Federal Bureau of Higher
Education. '

“.At this time, I have listened to a
two hour _presentation by associate
director of student activities, ‘Terry
Milani, that brought me up to date
on the entire matter (the renovation
project),”Kimbo said. “I also plan
on talking with more students. I
have already talked with the past
SGB president (Josh Baylson) and
with /the new president (Stan
Galanski). I have looked at the
results of a survey taken and plan
to draft my recommendations
within the next several weeks.”

Several possible sources of
funding for the renovation project
have been cited by the university in
the past months. Funding could be
sought from the state General
Services Administration, from the
university physical _plant fund, the
university general gift fund or from
a Student Union renovation fee.

Kimbo said he would support the

Student Union fee as a" mode of
funding because it is the only
feasible source of money for the
project.

“I am sensitive to the needs of
students and if I had my druthers
about me I would rather seek
funding from other sources. But if
the Student Union is to be
renovated, students must face the

fact that they must pay .a fee,”

Kimbo said.

Although Kimbo listed the
Student Union renovation project
as being very high on his list of
priorities, he stressed that it was
not his only concern.

Kimbo also expressed concern
over the dropping enrollment
recently experienced by Pitt.

Although he could state * no
specific plans to A remedy the
problem of decreasing enrollment
he said it is the primary concern of
his office to make Pitt a school that
is “pleasing to the students.”

“It is the small things that make
students happy or unhappy and it is
the small things that we must look
at, such as not shuffling students
around from office to office,
returning phone calls and just
being courteous,” Kimbo said. ”I
certainly hope that the Student
Union renovation project will help
the commuter sector of the
university community.”

Although commuter students
make up over 60 percent of the
undergraduate population, Kimbo
said the residence halls are one of

his main concerns. He added he
will be touring the residence halls‘
later this week with Fred Fonseca,
director of Office of Residence Life.

Another issue facing the student
affairs division is the fate of the Pitt
Union Program Council. The
program council is the official
channel for programming involving
student activities fees.

In it’s initial year, the program
council fell victim to charges‘ of
improprieties within the council by
members of various student organi-
zations,” Kimbo said.

“I do support the Pitt Union
Program Council and understand
that any problems experienced by
the council were more or less
growing pains in its early days,”
Kimbo said. “In all other aspects,
the Pitt Union Program Council is
comparable to the methods of
programming at other college.
campuses.”

Kimbo is no newcomer to
western Pennsylvania, having been
born in McKees'port. Before
coming to Pitt, Kimbo served as
dean of student affairs at the
University of Missouri in St. Louis
and, prior to that, dean of student
affairs at Grinnell College in Iowa.

“The university community,
which included students, faculty
and administration, is very stim-
ulating and exciting,” Kimbo said.
“It will be one of my primary goals
to get out and meet as many
students as possible.”

“students are taking a more
pragmatic, more honest and more
professional approach to issues at
hand.” "

Additionally, Miller said rela-
tions with the Pennsylvania Assoc-
iation For State Related Univer-
sities have been good.

Pitt, "Penn State, Lincoln and

Temple are “close knit” with the ,

committee through the association,
Miller said, and that relationship "is
to be continued during his term in
office. '

(Continued from page I)

would not occur. One employee
commented, “A strike is the last
thing we want,” explaining that
the workers could_ not afford a
strike.

Wages, work hours;-and benefits
are said to be three areas of

disagreement between the union

and management.

Because of the workers desire to
avoid a strike at any cost,
negotiations are expected to move
along at a brisk pace over the next
several days. Union officials claim
that they will be prepared to issue a
statement assessing the situation
at the bargaining table sometime
today. No specifics concerning
demands for changes in working
hours, wages or beneﬁts have been
disclosed by either side.

Miller stated the committee has
become a “recognized and highly
respectable” organization in the
eyes of Pitt administrators.

That relationship will be
strengthened over the remainder of
this academic year and into the
next by working with Pitt’s Office
of Commonwealth Relations, he
added.

“We’ll try to work with the
university on issues that are
equally important to the adminis-
tration and to students. However,

we will keep our autonomy, ” Miller
_ said.

Work with People’s Oakland, an
organization composed of Oakland
residents concerned with the
direction of the community, will
continue, Miller said.

A request for approximately
$4,800 will be submitted to SGB’s
Allocations Committee this month,
Miller said. Most of that money is
to be used for eight lobbying trips.

Decisions about the issues the
committee will lobby for will be
made when it is known what bills

are coming before the state
legislature, but efforts will be made
to push for the lowered drinking
age, marijuana decriminalization
and any landlord-tenant bills,
Miller said.

Issues of student tenant rights
will be particularly pushed over the
next few months, he added,
because ‘ ‘lots of students statewide
are affected by this.”

Two political workshops are
included in the budget as “basic-

The workshops are designed to

added.

The committee will be in

Miller said.

Pitt Residence Halls Plagued By Rash of False Fire Alarms

Bruce Hall residents were forced
to evacuate their building late last
night when a tenth floor smoke
detector was touched off by the
smoke from a resident’s kitchen
stove.

Batallion Chief Joe Harper said
he and his men were “happy” to

answer the call in light of the rash
of false alarms recently turned in at
Pitt dorms.

According to Harper, ﬁremen
have been forced to answer more
than 66 false alarms at Pitt since
September. »

Harper added that this total is
the highest nationwide for colleges
and universities across the nation.

“When we look at this tonight,
we have to point to the fact that
things like ﬁres really do happen,”

Opinion

The
Pitt Times

“The University Times” will continue tooperate
as a bi-weekly paper—at least that’s the latest word
from Pitt administrators. ’

,“The Times will publish as usual and will continue
to do so in the foreseeable future,” Mary Ann Aug,

director of News and Publications said last week,
disputing rumors that the university planned to cease
publication.

She added, however, “Some steps will be taken in
the future to help the paper meet the communica-
tional needs of the community.” Aug said she had
been instructed to investigate the possibility of
making The Times a “high quality, objective

newspaper” with a new look. It will be interesting to '

see just what the university intends with these
“steps” to make‘ the paper “objective” and of “high
quality.”

“The University Times” was established in the late
1960s in order to keep faculty and staff members in-
formed of events within the university. The Times
does not sell advertising space and relies entirely on
administration funding for its existence. It is written
in the constitution of the paper that the ad-
ministration will never try to inﬂuence the editorial
policy of the newspaper.

There have been occasions where certain ad-
ministrators have been bitterly opposed to the con-
tent of the Times’ pages and tried to influence the
directors. One issue entirely devoted to the subject of
changing sexual mores infuriated one vice chancellor
and many administrators were adamantly against the
paper covering a 1976 faculty attempt to unionize.

Most‘ recently, some Pitt officials have voiced op-
position to the “Letters to the Editor” section, and
this may have lead to the rumor (if, indeed, that’s all
it was).

Faculty members at a Faculty Assembly meeting
recently who questioned the paper’s situation should
be commended for offering their support to the
paper in light of the alleged “secret resolution” to
replace the Times with an “in-house publication.”

Page 6—Monday, _March 5, 1979',

Such a publication would probably cost no less than
the Times to produce and would violate the univer-
sity’s original commitment to an independent paper
as well as violate the spirit of the first amendment.
The university is, in a sense, run much like a cor-

.-poration, and corporations do have their own public

relations leaflets. But, the university was established
to promote higher education, and this purpose
demands the free dissemination of ideas without cen-
sorship. If the administration is contemplating
changes for the Times, that is their right——after all,
they are paying for it. But, if there are to be changes,
let us hope they are of a technical nature, involving
better equipment or increasing the efficiency of the
staff without affecting actual content or origin of the
stories.

If publications like the Times are not given the
chance to survive, it'will only be a matter of time
before student publications will become open to cen-
sorhip also.

‘They Don’t Pay Us Enough Either, Cyril.’

By JOHN RIGHETTI

Joe Pacek, on his lunch, sat with
fellow workers in the locker room of
a Pittsburgh steel mill, leafing’
through the daily paper. Suddenly,
he jumped to his feet, wide-eyed.

“Hey; fellas! I‘ve just'been
reading about this coroner's
business-—you know that profes-
sional education fund?” he said.

“So,” Ed Cicchi, a laborer, said.

“So, I just got a great idea,"
Pacek said.

“What?” _

“Well, this Lain Lee...he’s the
secretary for Pittsburgh’s 13th ‘
Ward Democratic Committee and
he was at those Democratic
endorsements at the Syria Mosque.

He said——“listen to this—‘I
don’t think the county pays enough
for men in professional positions.
It’s the same in Harrisburg.
Salaries are not enough for the
caliber of men we want in office.

,Wecht had to find some way to

compensate his employees.’ That's

‘I

where the professional education
fund comes in.” .

“So what's the idea?" Cicchi
said, slipping a quarter‘ into the
coffee machine.

“Don’t you see? Do we feel we
get paid enough to do what we have
to do?"

“No,” shouted one of the men
through a mouthful of chicken
salad.’ '

“Don't you think we could use
some compensation?” _

“Yeah,” a few of the men
mumbled.

“Well, why don’t we get it?”~

Pacek said.

“Joe, what are you talking
about?” Cicchi asked-. “Get to the
point.”

“Ah, Cicchi, don’t ya see? We
start one of these professional

“education funds for ourselves."

“But, we aren't professionals.”

“Hey Cicchi, how do they know
who to let in the Olympics? How do
they decide who is a professional
and who is an amateur athlete,?”
Joe asked.

“The professionals are the ones
that get paid,” answered Cicchi.

“Right! And don't we get
paid?“

“Yeah."

“Then we are professionals,’
Joe said”.

Pacek sat down and reached into
his lunchbucket, pulling out an
apple and taking a big bite.

.“Now here’s the scoop," Pacek
began, whispering in conspiratorial
tones to the other men huddled
around him. “We set up one of
these professional educational
funds for ourselves here at the
plant.” '

“How we gonna do that?"

“Come on, Cicchi, don’t you
read the papers? We take in
outside work and then put the cash
in a special account for ourselves."

“What outside work?"

“Oh, all kinds. Nippon steel,
some orders from Canadian and
West German steel companies. It
wouldn’t be any trouble. Every-
body knows we’re the best
steelworkers in the world. Qur

reputation is well known."
“How would we operate this?”
“Well, we’d take the requests
for outside orders—-steel sheets,

rods, what-have-you—and then do.

them here in the plant," Pacek
said, taking another bite.

' “When would we do this outside
stuff?”

“Cicchi, I don’t know about you.
When do you think? We’d do it
during our normal work day.”

“We’ll get caught!” Cicchi said,
jumping up from his seat.

“How?” Pacek replied, taking"
off half the apple in one bite. “Sit
down, Cicchi. Now, how are we
gonna get caught? We'll be
running sheets and rods like any
other day. How’s management

gonna know we’re doing an outside‘
- job?” ,

“Hey, that’s pretty smart, Joe!"

“Thanks. I don’t want to be
immodest but I'm one of the
smartest steelworkers this side of
Youngstown."

The men sat around for a while,
mulling over the idea and digging
into their lunches. The smell of
lunch meats and coffee filled the

- air. Finally, after his last mouthful

of bologna, Cicchi spoke up again.

“Hey Joe.”

“What Cicchi?”

“What -you’re saying is we'd
work on outside jobs right here in
the plant on company time using
company equipment, but put the
money we get for the jobs in an
account to compensate ourselves.

“Right.”

“Can we do that?”

“It's been done before.”

Letters

Major change in B-ball? C

I am writing in response to an
excellent letter by Charles Perlow
regarding Pitt basketball. It brings
out what many people know but
about which they never said
anything.

My friends are sick of hearing
me complain about the poor
treatment of the basketball team.
There is no reason a school the size
of Pitt should not have a nationally
recognized basketball team. The-
attendance at“ the Eastern Eight
Playoffs shows that the city, of
Pittsburgh would indeed be willing

to support a team.

A few years ago the school
poured money into its football
program and saw the team become
the best in the country. Now that it
has been shown it can be done in
one area let's do it in another.

The university can start by
putting into action the plan to
renovate the Field House. If I was
a top-notch prospect and saw that
dirty place, I wouldn’t come and
play here.

 - Paciﬁc Repertory Brings Greek Tragedy to Life  

«it:

By MICHAEL McCABE
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Baochae
Directed by Denis Aubrey

Paciﬁc Repertory Company

The abundance of long speeches and heavy reliance on
narration rather than action in ancient Greek tragedy can
potentially be very dry and dull. Yet, it doesn’t have to be
that way and the Paciﬁc Repertory Company proves this.

Last weekend, they brought “The Bacchae” to the
stage, alive with frenzy and fury. This play by Euripides
tells how the god Dionysus exacts revenge on those who

fail to rmognize him.

The Greeks are chieﬂy remembered as progressive men,
upholders of - reason and order.
represents the other aspect of human nature——the

primitive and the immersion in emotions.

Since it is so old, no set version of the play exists. While
the main theme is ﬁxed, different interpretations can vary
in details and emphasis. This production seizes on the
primitive element and presents it powerfully and vividly.

Members of the chorus, followers of Dionysus, leap and
run about. They crawl, roll and writhe in delight and in
rage. Their yells and chants mix with the rhythm of drums.

Also, a good deal-of actionis added to round out the
story. Actions such as the good-natured wrestling between
Teiresias and Cadmus are not included in all versions of the
play, but they niakethe characters much more lifelike.

Dionysus, however,

One danger of trying to intensify the play, according to
director Dennis Aubrey, lies in going too far and stepping
over the bounds of seriousness into comic exaggeration.

But, the performance was not overdrawn and the horror

that fell upon Pentheus and his family showed clearly.
Though he doesn’t have the prescribed blond curls, Tony
Acierto suits the role of Dionysus well. His sly. smirk and
inscrutable leer fit the countenance of a sensuous god.
The best moments of Michael Harris’ portrayal of
Pentheus come when Pentheus, dressed as a woman,
attempts the Bacchic dance. Harris’ dazed and awkward
movements make it so pitifully apparent how Dionysus has
possessed his mind in order to lead him to death. Jeffry
Paul Freundlich as Cadmus and Alexander C. Wright as
Teiresias also play their parts with spirit and energy.

‘The Deer Hunter, ’ ‘Coming Home’

By SAM ROSSI
Pitt News Staff Writer
Intimate Strangers I
Tom Scott
Columbia

To say that Tom Scott is merely

~prolific is a gross misjudgment.

Scott has literally emulsified
himself in jazz and anything else
that requires spicy sax accompani-
ment. -

Scott’s latest release, “lntimate
Strangers,” is but a pinnacle
among pinnacles. The guy just
produces quality stuff album after
album.

Scott’s name is as familar in rock
music as it is in jazz circles. Scott’
has played back-up on albums by
Joni Mitchell, Barbara_ Streisand,
Steely Dan, Blues Brothers, Carole
King, Eddie Money and B02 Scagg

to name but a few. He has written
musical scores for several promi-
nent television series, as well as
several motion pictures. He is also
the recipient of countless music
awards.

As the title suggests, “Intimate
Strangers” is concerned with
romance and deep feelings. The
latter is a very appropriate
description of Scott’s approach to
his music.

The ﬁrst side is composed of a
three-part, six-song suite. titled
“Intimate Stranger’s Suite.” Scott
tells a story through the continuity
of the suite. A saxophonist notices
a certain female in the third row of
a jazz club. He is encaptured by
her appearance and consequently
conjures up images of her with him
in a romantic setting.-

Particularly effective is Scott’s

  Scott Continues High Quality

light‘, airy, tenor sax solos
throughout the suite, as well as
excellent performances by the

accompanying musicians.

Side two is comprised of four
separate numbers that are com-
plete in themselves, not integrated
into the suite. The first number is a
mellow tune titled, “Breezin’
Easy.” Three up-tempo jazz pieces
follow: “You’re So Good to Me,”
“Puttin’ the Bite On You,” and
“Beautiful ’Music.”

Unlike many genres of music,
jazz possesses an inherent quality
of showcasing the musicians
feelings, particularly so in “Inti-
mate Strangers.” Scott’s music
transcends the limitations of plastic
vinyl. It brings a tangible feeling
from artist to listener that makes
both, “Intimate Strangers.”

The Vietnam Experience Comes to the Screen

By. PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor
The Vietnam film—the actual,
truthful look at the war that went
beyond the toy soldier posture of
epics like John Wayne’s “The
Green Berets”—first surfaced in
1973 in “American Graffiti,”
although this past year saw the
greatest inﬂux of films on the
anti-war theme.
“Graffiti, ” of course, was mostly
a ﬁlm of coming of age for two
friends leaving the cruise and
booze scene of southern California
for college in the East. The film’s
end, however, showed the high
school graduation photos of the
leads with “where are they now”
captions and it brought a pleasant,
light film down to startling reality.
These boys of 1962 were the ones
shipped over to Vietnam and it
changed the whole meaning of

“American Graffiti” from light-

, eﬁrtainment to a statement on
,the'war. ‘

The two most highly acclaimed
Vietnam films are “Coming

Home” and “The Deer Hunter.”
The former is about the awakening
of an army wife (Jane Fonda) to
reality and the adjustments made
by the paraplegic vet (Jon Voight)
who becomes her lover. The latter
deals with three friends (Robert
DeNiro, John Savage and Chris-
topher Walken) who leave the
Clairton steelworks for an 11th
hour effort in Vietnam. Both deal
with adjustment on the home front:
“Coming Home” focuses on
romance and growth, “The Deer
Hunter” juxtaposes scenes of the
horror that was Vietnam with the
improbable, naivete‘ of the home
folks in Clairton. Combining the
two makes for the perfect Vietnam
film: separately, they do not
sustain credibility.

“Coming Home” is actually a
glorified soap opera. Fonda’s
husband (Bruce Dern) seems to
have been trained on old World
War II films. It is too easy to see
why she is anxious to stand on her
own for once and how she can be
attracted to Voight who gives an

FILM .
ANAL YSIS

exceptionally charismatic perfor-
mance.

Penelope Milford, as Fonda’s
friend, plays a spaced-out Greek
chorus. Her character is sup-
posedly verging on a nervous
collapse because her brother
returned from the war as a
shellshocked vegetable. But Mil-
ford’s hysteria and“‘loosen up”
advice to Fondaseem stagey and
pretentious. It is hard to believe the
staid army wife Fonda portrays
would immediately find a kindred
spirit in Milford.

Voight’s performance sustains
the film. He has suffered, yet he
can still strive for change; he still
fights to warn others about what’s
really happening in Vietnam.

There is no footage of the war. It
is seen only ‘through the eyes of
Voight and Dern.‘This tends to
build distance. Dern describes his

feelings on a My Lai-type massacre
to Fonda, but the background
music—a tastelessly blaring track
of the Rolling Stones
“Sympathy for the Devil”—makes

what should have been a poignant
scene into high camp for its H

simple-mindedness.

“The Deer Hunter” lacks the
one-track approach of “Coming
Home” but the magnificent con-
trasts between the home and
Vietnam scenes is weakened due to
the choppiness of the editing and
the apolitical tone of the film.

De Niro and his friends join up,
but the reasons are not given. De
Niro, who looks at least 10 years too
old for his part, plays the old Bogie-
type hero-—the loner who can lead
his weak friends, the survivor who
has the self-assurance to face
anything—-even a Russian roulette
game in a mad contest for life
against his Vietcong captors.

The costars are among the most
believable in any film released

recently. They are not educated or,‘

sophisticated like many of the

singing '

characters in “Coming Home.”
The trip to Vietnam is treated like a
great adventure, something to top
all those hunting seasons in the
Pennsylvania hills where De Niro is
obsessed with a kill with one_ shot.

The female lead, Meryl Streep as

the girl back home, waits for .

someone to marry her and take her
away from her sadistic, drunk
father and the job at the local
supermarket check-out. When
Streep’s fiance, Walken, is re-
ported AWOL, she clings to De
Niro, back home after his dis-
charge, and drags him. into the
market to show off his medals as if
he won them for her.

So, in "The Deer Hunter,”
where there are no political
references, where the actual
feelings about the war are
expressed only by an occasional
subtle contrast scene, the ending is"
a total shock, because it is
extremely sardonic and political.

“The Deer Hunter” comes so
close it is all the more painful that it
does not quite’ satisfy.

Tanner Band Comes Across Strong in New LP

By SAM ROSS]

Pitt News Slaffwriter
No Escape
The Marc Tanner Band
Elektra Records

The debut release from the Marc
Tanner Band, titled “No Escape,”
can best be summed up as
tastefully done pop-music. Most of
the material is done in the same

discerning listener would find it
hard to distinguish Tanner’s vocals
from Scaggs’ at times.
Predominantly, the material on
“No Escape” is standard, pop-
based rock
intermittent ballads. The strength
of “No Escape” lies in the fact that
Tanner takes the cliched pop
sound, adds a personal touch
and—‘-Aprestol—égood music that
lacks redundancy. ,
Tanner’s band consists of Richie

“acoustic keyboards

’n’ roll with‘ some "

Zito on guitars, Mike Baird on
drums, Bob Glaub on bass and
by William
Smith. “No Escape” also has
some established veterans-Jim
Hom, Jeff Porcaro, David Paich,
Rosemary Butler, Vanetta Fields
and others. Paich, Horn and
Porcaro backed up Scaggs’ on his
“Silk Degrees” album. T

Throughout “No Escape,” Tan-
ner’s vocals are dynamic without
sounding strained. The musical

performances are comparable to a
finely honed piece of machinery.
The string ensemble back-up is
simply" ﬂawless as arranged by
production veteran Glen Spreen.
“No Escape” opens ‘with an
up-tempo, crisp rocker called
“Never Again.” Following is
‘ ‘Crawlin’ , ’ ’ another fast-paced
number. These tunes are over-
whelmed by Tanner’s infectious
style that__mal§e_bgth excellent cuts.

intrigue about “She’s So High.”
Tanner paints a picture of jet set
night life with fast cars and even
faster women.

“Elena” is a rocker with just a
touch of the Latin beat a la early
1960s Jay and the Americans. The
interplay between the sax part and
the rhythm section here is superb.

Closing” up side one is “Edge of
Love,” a ﬁne tune that serves to
keep the listener in anticipation of
side two.

The first number on side two is
“Getaway.” It's another rock ‘n’

roll number that starts this side off

with a bang.

“Lady in Blue” opens with a
symphonic string arrangement that
changes over to a soul-based guitar
lead. The lyrics elicit more imagery
of the give and take of night life.

"‘In a Spotlight” is an ethereal
soul number and, once again, the
night-life imagery comes through.

“Lost at Love” is a straight-for-
ward love ballad performed with
feeling by Tanner. Closing “No
Escape” is another brisk rocker
titled “Your Tears Don’t Lie.”

It would be advisable to pick up a
copy of “No Escape” as soon as
possible. This is just the type of
album radio stations love to wear
out.

Rutgers Downs Pitt in Final, 6

Rutgers’ James Bailey and Pitt’s Terry Knight are synchronized their rebounding

efforts.

Srakocic photo

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

King James and his Knights did
it again to Pitt Saturday night,
defeating the hopeful Panthers,
61-57, before the largest crowd
ever to watch a college basketball
game in Pittsburgh.

The Panthers simply could not
take advantage of Rutgers’ 21
turnovers, especially during the
closing minutes of the Eastern
Eight Championship, when_ the
hometown favorite had several
opportunities to pull within one or
two points.

Rutgers trailed only once in the
game, 2-0. Although Pitt was
outrebounded, 36-22, the Panthers’
poor field goal shooting (37
percent) was the suicidal element.
The new Eastern Eight champs
shot an excellent 58 percent and, at
one point, led by 10. .

Not a team to roll over and play
dead before 16,009 screaming fans,
Pitt clawed its way back with shots
by Terry Knight, Sammie Ellis and
Carlton Neverson. At 2:15, the
score was suddenly a competitive
56-53.

The margin was still three points
more than a minute later, when
reminiscent of the ﬁrst Pitt-Rutgers
game played just a week earlier,
the Panthers muffed a golden
opportunity to score after Rutgers
Kelvin Troy missed the front end of
a one-and-one. -

Troy put the game away at the
free-throw line moments later
when he stretched the Scarlet
Knights’ lead to four with eight
seconds remaining.

Rutgers’ James Bailey, the
tournament's Outstanding Player,
had an even game of 12 points and
as many rebounds, but his mere
presence was inﬂuential. Scarlet
Knight head coach Tom Young said
of Bailey:

“(Bailey) didn’t score as many
points as usual but...he controlled
the boards and he controlled Sam
Clancy...the league won’t miss
Bailey next year, but l’ll sure miss
him.”

Young then mentioned another
key aspect.

-57

“Everyone thought Pitt’s press
would bother us, but it didn’t," he
said.

“When you play three games in
ﬁve days and press for 40 minutes
in each, you’re bound to be tired,”
said Pitt coach Tim Grgurich.
“With a team our size, we had to
press.”

The breakdown of Pitt’s press
allowed Rutgers to score on several
fast breaks during the second half.

“We missed some opportunities
of our own on fast breaks,”
Grgurich added. “I really felt the
last three minutes we were
ﬂustered. We just could not make
the big basket.”

Knight and Neverson led Pitt
with 16 points a piece while
Rutgers’ Abdel Anderson and Troy
each had 15. While Bailey was not
his usual domineering self, neither
was Sam Clancy. Clancy picked up
his third foul with eight minutes
remaining in the ﬁrst half and had
to sit out part of the game.

Clancy ﬁnished with eight points
and four rebounds, but this was
partly due to Rutgers’ stifling
defense.

“We tried to get the ball to
Sam,” said 'Grgurich, “but their
defense did such a good job.”

And so Rutgers (21-8), the
perennial pre-tournament favorite,
ﬁnally becomes the Eastern Eight
champ, prompting an exuberant if
understandably cocky Young to say
from the press podium after the
game,

“See you here next year, same
time, same place.”

-PITT NOTES: A 31,217 total
attendance ﬁgure for the Civic
Arena games, plus 19,699 for the
ﬁrst-round games makes this the
most successful Eastern Eight
tournament yet...West Virginia

remarks about the league. Follow-

Panther Swim Teams Capture Eastem Titles
Men Cop Fourth Straight

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s swimmers (10-0) have
ambivalent feelings after winning
their fourth straight Eastern
championship this weekend at the
Penn State Natatorium.

The Panthers, who scored 479
points, 159 more than those posted
by second-place West Virginia,
were happy to win the team title
in such convincing fashion, but

, disappointed that more of their

swimmers did not qualify for this
month’s National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association Championship.

Pitt made the NCAA mark in
only ﬁve events.
“As a team, we did great,” Pitt
swimmer Dale Pﬂaumer said about
Saturday's meet. “Most of us had
our best times of the season, but
there were some people who
wanted to do better, like Jeff Trew
and Bob Clemmer.”

/

Trew, 500 and 1,650-yard free-
styles, and Clemmer, 100-yard
breaststroke, were both expected
to qualify for the NCAA champion
ship but failed to do so.

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women's swim team (10-1)
rolled to its ﬁrst Eastern regional
championship this weekend at
West Chester State College. Pitt
scored 500 points, easily outdis-
tancing second place Rutgers,
which had 342.

Rutgers, the defending cham-
~pion, and Pitt were both favorites
heading into the three-day meet.

“We did super," said coach
Kate Mathison, noting that all but
four Pantherettes scored. “Every-
one contributed. Kathy (Stetler),
the freshmen—they all did a super,
super job. We got a real team
effort.”

Stetler, and freshmen Julie
Terrell, Sandy Taylor and Amy
‘Jackson, who teamed up to win

Pitt's Holly Martino and Bob
Besong set season highs in the
all-around competition Saturday to
lead their respective gymnastics
teams to impressive showings
againsftough competition.

Martino scored 35.0-good
enough for second place—--in
helping the women to rackiup their
highest score of the season against
second-ranked Penn State, which
won the meet, 139.35-134.6.

“Holly had a very good night,”
said coach Donna DeMarino Sanft.
“l was very pleased.”

Martino also placed in the top
four in each individual event. She
was third in the vault (9.1), second
in the uneven bars(8.95). tied for
fourth in the balance beam (8.2)
and tied with teammate Bonnie
Tressler for second in the ﬂoor
«exercise (8.75).

Sanft was also pleased with the
performances of Roxanne Evans
and Myra Bachuchin, who scored
season-high marks in the vault and
uneven bars, respectively.

Evans was fourth in the vault
with 8.95 and ﬁfth in the ﬂoor
exercise, with an 8.45. Bachuchin
was fourth in the uneven bars with
an 8.7 and third in the balance
beam with an 8.25. The two Pitt
teammates tied with each other for
fourth place in the all-around,
scoring 33.35

Penn State was paced by Lisa
Ingebretsen, who edged Martino
for top all-around honors with a
35.05. lngebretsen was also first in
the uneven bars and floor exercise
scoring 9.25 and 8.85, respectively.

Two Lady Lions dominated the
vault and balance beam. Marcy
Levine and Jan Anthony went
one-two in each event—Levine
scored a 9.3 in the .vault to
Anthony’s 9.2, while in the beam,

Levine scored 8.75 and Anthony,

8.35.

ISSUES AND AN OCCASIONAL ANSWER...

You have something to

according to Sanft.

“Our first goal is to place third in
the regionals and secondly, we
want to qualify for nationals,” she
said. “If we achieve those two
goals, I'll be able to call this season
a very successful one.

“This score will help our season
average a lot in our bid to make the
nationals,” Sanft said.

The men, while not scoring that
elite mark of 200 points, managed
to run up a total of 196.15 to
Farmingdale State’s score of
195.45.

“The judging was poor,” said
coach Frank D’Amico. “It was as if
we were competing at Farming-
dale. We should have really scored
200.”

The Panthers were ‘led by
Besong, who won the all-around
and placed second in four
events—the floor exercise (8.8),
vault (9.05), and rings (8.9) and
tied for second in the high bar
(8.85).

“Bob did a new move on his
dismount in the rings, and if that
didn’t earn him a 9.0, nothing
will,” said D’Amico. “It was a
one-half in, one-half out—an
international move that made his
routine worth at least a 9.2, and
they"only scored him with an 8.9.”

Alan Meyers also . did an
outstanding job, taking ﬁrst-place
in ‘four of five events. He won the
floor exercise. (8.85), vault (9.2),
parallel bars (8.9) and high bar
(8.85).

“The entire meet came down to
that last event——the high bar,” said
D’Amico. f‘Actually, it came down

to the last two performers for us,
Bob (Besong) and Al (Meyers).
They pulled it out and managed to
place one-two while doing it.”
Leading Farmingdale State was
Mike Nowakowski, who placed
second in the all-around with a
48.9. He also won the rings (9.2)
and placed second in the parallel

bars (8.8).
D’Amico said that he was
pleased with freshman Joe

Femiani, who scored his highest

all-around ever, 44.65, which.

placed him fourth. Captain Doug
Smith also had his highest
all-around score, 46.35—-good for
third place. 0
“Doug will certainly be missed
after he graduates, along with the
three other seniors, Tony Savelli,
Mitch Spero and Dave Rich,” said
D’Amico. .
“Gymnastics is a sport of
rewards,” D’Amico said. “The
individual gets rewarded for

executing a tough move, but we "

just didn’t get any of the rewards
that we deserved Saturday.” _
GYM NOTES: The Panthers
ﬁnish the season with a record of
4-3 and will compete in the Eastern
regionals at Louisiana State Uni-
versity March 23. T The men will
compete only individually and not
as a team...the women’s ﬁnal
season record is 6-3. The Penn
State meet is not counted because
it was a substitute meet. However,
the score of the meet will be
averaged in with all the other
scores when bids to national are
given out...The women’s regionals
will be held at Maryland March 15.

Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pitt women’s basketball

team was unable to capitalize on an

11-point ﬁrst half lead and lost to
top-seeded Cheyney State, 62-46,
in first round Eastern Regional
playoff action last weekend at
Delaware. .
Although the Pantherettes‘ found
themselves in the , eighth-seed
position and facing the number-one

team in the East, they were able to

take a 20-9 lead in the ﬁrst
half——the biggest lead of the game.

“In the first half, our defense
was outstanding—they played
really great,” said Pitt coach Jean
Balthaser. “Then two of our big
players got in foul trouble, which
forced us to play a much more
conservative game in the time
remaining.”

Centers Wanda Randolph (who
ﬁnished the game as the only
Pantherette in double ﬁgures with

Pantherettes Win First.

the 400-yard freestyle relay,

(accounted for many of the

Pantherettes’ first place finishes.

Stetler was Pitt’s leading scorer

. for the second straight year with

wins in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyles, and the 50-yard butter-
ﬂy. The senior from Oakmonti set
meet records in both the 100- and
200-yard freestyles.

Besides Stetler, Terrell, Taylor
and Jackson, Pitt’s scorers in-
cluded swimmers Linda Franken-
bach, Judy Klotz, Nancy Henry,
Suzanne Pulley and Christy Elston,
and divers Cindy Ferraro, Holly
Sluss and Hillary McBride.

Pulley, who set a meet record by
winning the 100-yard individual
medley, swam on the winning
200-yard freestyle relay team with
Taylor, Elston and Terrell.

After winning eight of the‘ 12 4

events during the first day of
competition, Pitt, improving each
day, never trailed in the meet.
“Rutgers thought they had us
beat on the first day when they won
the 800-yard freestyle relay,”
‘Mathison said. “Boy, were they

sure riding high after that victory.

“But we came back the next day.

and won the 200-yard freestyle
relay, the first event and Rutgers
was never the,/same,” Mathison

continued. “They just didn’t have .

it that second day.”

Pitt now prepares for the
Association of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women national cham-
pionships, which its host March
14 to 17.

Stetler, Henry, Jackson, Klotz,
Pulley, Taylor, Terrell, McBride
and Sluss have qualified for that
meet.

18 points and 17 rebounds) and
Gail Aughburns were tabbed with
three fouls each early in the game,
diminishing the Pantherettes’
aggressiveness at the boards on
defense, allowing Cheyney State to
dominate the game.

Fouls took a toll at the foul line
for the Pantherettes as Pitt only
shot 2 for 8 from the line, compared
to Cheyney State’s 14 for 21. Only
one field goal separated the two
teams, as Pitt went 22 for 65 from

I

the field and Cheyney State, 24 for
66.

Ahead by a 24-22 score at
halftime, the Pantherettes played
even ball with Cheyney State,
keeping the lead until five minutes
into the second half. Up by a 32-31
score, Cheyney State began _a
scoring drive of seven unanswered
points that clinched the victory.

“I believe that we could have
won this game,” Balthaser said.
“We werein a position where we

    Pantherettes Fall toTop-Seeded Cheney state, 62-46 

were playing the number-one team
in the East and our lead forced the

‘pressure to their side.

. “But when they started coming
back we started to press instead of
playing loose. We let it get to us

‘and lost composure which'even-

tually lost us the game.”

The top four seeds in the
tournament , won. Next week's
competition will find Cheyney State
playing Maryland and Penn State
pitted against Rutgers.

cRAzv FOR GOD

The Nightmare of Cult Life

by Christopher Edwards

How are young minds twisted in the name of
God? What happened to Chris, son of a
prominent surgeon, could happen to
anyone. CRAZY FOR GOD offers insight
into what ‘draws ordinary youngsters to
extremist religious cults and answers

‘ questions about what cults “actually do, what

it is like to live in one, why members can't
get out, what brainwashing and de-
programming are really like, and more.
