begin with accusations
of company conspiracy

By Manuel Hernandez
Staff‘ Writer.

An inquiry into the research
practices of Dr. Herbert
Needleman began yesterday with
accusations of a conspiracy by
the lead industry to destroy
Needleman’s reputation as a
pioneer in research on the effects
of lead on children.

Needleman said many of his

colleagues who have published‘

research challenging the lead
industry have fallen under the
same scrutiny. He cited lawsuits
against colleagues as well as
attempts to damage their
professional reputation.
Needleman suggested that his
accusers — Drs. Sandra Scarr of

Case Western Reserve Medical,

School and Claire Ernhart,
commonwealth professor at the
University of Virginia —— were
acting on the behalf of the lead
industry" to discredit him.

He stated that the legal firm
representing the two is the same
firm known to represent the lead
industry. .

‘‘The very same law firm that is"
representing my accusers today
is the same law firm that
represents much of the lead
industry in legal matters,”
Needleman said. '

Both Ernhart and Scarr refused
to comment when asked by

validity of Ernhart and Scarr’s
testimony, Saying they will testify
for whoever will pay them. He
added that he believed the two
have received over 33 100,000 fro
the lead industry. '
In a further attempt to discredit
his accusers, Needleman
defended his method of reporting
his research, saying Ernhart
followed the same methods when
publishing a paper in 1981 that

challenged his 1979 research on ‘.

lead toxicity. Ernhart said
Needleman failed to follow
relative standards of practice
when doing his research.

Ernhart refused to discuss her
research methods. ,

“The purpose of these hearings
is to determine whether or not
Dr. Needleman followed the
relative standards of practice for
research. My methods of research
are irrelevant to the issue at hand,”
Ernhart said. ,

Needleman also said Ernhart
criticiaed his work as early as
1981, prior to seeing his raw data
in 1990, at which point she felt
his research methods were
questionable. Ernhart refused
comment.

Ernhart criticized Needleman
saying he was attempting to take
the focus of the hearings away

4 from his research practices.

First black woman preside

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

Calling for a return to democracy and
equitable treatment for African—Americans,
independent presidential candidate Dr.
Lenora Fulani spoke to students yesterday
in the William Pitt Union.

The first black woman to be on the
ballot in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, Fulani said she wants to make
democracy the issue of the 1992 election.

“I am a black woman who will go
anywhere andldo anything for democracy,”
she said. ’ A

Fulani, a developmental psychologist .

and practicing social therapist in Harlem,
first ran for the presidency in 1988 and is
currently the chairperson of the New
Alliance Party, a liberal political party.
Though Fulani said she does not expect

to win the White House, she said her
. campaign has a purpose. A

“I have no illusions about _the‘:Whit'e
House: Blacks, women, need not apply,”

 Fulani said. “I'm” running as at national

candidate who has benefits for the black
community, the white community, the
people of this country.”

Fulani said the American people are fed
up with the current political system. The
dissatisfaction people have with the two
main political parties is the reason more
people have come out to run for office and
vote. ‘ v

“The public is fed up with corrupt
politicians  people are beginning to see
and realize there is a need to go in other
directions  they want more choices in
the electoral arena,” she said. “The issue is
if we’re going to be home and [angry] or
come out in November.”

Specifically addressing the needs of the
blackicommunity, she said the current
situation must change and the future of
the black community is at stake.

The actions and programs that are
currently operating could destroy
the African-American people, Fulani
said. u .

“Black. folks are dyingin this community,

and black politicians have a responsibility _

to respond,” she said.

When asked about the rift between
black Republicans and black Democrats,
Fulani said. “I don’t give a {care} about
disunity or unity; I care about what’s
happening to our people.”

When addressing the issues regarding
the black community, she brought up the

campaign ofthe Washington, 'D.C., shadow '
' Sen. Jesse Jackson.

Fulani said Jackson sold out.

“Uacksonl has four houses, while many
of o'ur people are sleeping on the goddamn
streets,” Fulani said.

She told the audience to respond to
Jackson's requests to vote for Democrats
by saying, “Dr. Fulani says a vote for a
Democrat  is not only a dumb vote, but
it’s a dangerous vote. We’re tired of being
ripped off and left with nothing.-”

Fulani also discussed the other
politicians, specifically those currently
running in the presidential primary. Many
are racists and could harm the future of
America, she said-. ‘ i

“I think [presidential candidate Bill

ntial candidate calls for equality,

Clinton] is a racist. You don’t accidentally
play ‘golf at a place for 10 years and "not
notice they don’t allow blacks. If you’re
not that perceptive, you don’t deserve to
be president,” she said.

“lClinton and presidential candidateJerry
Brown] discovered black people about

three weeks‘ before they came, into the —

primary,” she said.

“Pat Buchanan is a white supremist. The
only difference between Pat Buchanan
and David Duke are their names,” Fulani
said.

Fulani said she has also been the recipient
of harassment during her campaign. The

FBI ‘is investigating and harassing her, she‘ . J

said. ‘ ’

She said she was beaten up by the -
police in New York outside of a debate for , 

no legitimate reason. “I had a ticket and
was told by the police I couldn’t go in [to
a political debate]. I told them I wasn't’
going to move; they then physically

i_ assaulted me,” she said. V
Fulani says many actions need to be. _‘

“We want to make a fair
representation of American
music,” Goldsmith said.
“Europeans usually flip over
American music,” he said.

Twenty-five jazz, pop, country,
spiritual and Zulu tribe selections
will be performed a cappella by
the choir. It will also be singing
each country’s national anthem
in its native language.

:“The European audiences just
like to hear harmonies and
rhythms. They love spirituals,"
he said.

choir speaks the native language
of each country to be visited. “We

According to Goldsmith, the
choir began planning the trip
two years ago.

’ He said the choir did everything
it could think of to raise funds.
To raise money, choir members
became “singing valentines,"
sponsored a raffle, had a patron
drive and even tried to sell frozen
meat.

They also received a grant from
the Vira Heinz Foundation.
Collectively, the choir raised
$44,000.

“We have been reallyfbusy this
year,” he said.

This year the choir sang at Pitt
Chancellor}. Dennis O’Connor’s

installation, two CAS_ alumni
gatherings, . four and a half
concerts on campus as well as
other concerts on and off campus.

The choir performed its spring
concert this past Sunday at a
packed Heinz Chapel and
received a standing ovation.

The choir members will be
able to spend at least 24 hours
touring each major city visited
and will sightsee between concert
cities.

“It will completely change [the
students]. They will realize how
lucky we have it here,” Goldsmith
said. “They will also realize how
young we are as a nation. It is a
sobering experience to realize
what youngsters we are as a
culture.” '

He said he thinks the students
will come back with an appetite
to travel. “We are all very glad
that the day is coming,” he said.

Goldsmith said the students
will be happy to be on the plane
with fund—raising and exams
behind them.

T eachingrl 45 y

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Standing in front of his United
Sta_tes Political Parties class,
Professor James Kehl told an
account of how he, as a graduate
student in 1948, attended the
Democratic Convention in
Philadelphia.

“Once we got in, we all waited
for Trumanto arrive,” l_<e_hl, said.
“Harry finally walks up onto. the
stage, stands at the podiumtand
reads offa notebook. ‘Now for a
few words about agriculture  
Kehl mimicked the former
president’s harsh drawl.

“It was a little disappointing
after having heard FDR’s eloquent
speeches as a kid. By the time
Harry was through reading off
the page, I knew, as everybody
else did, that he would never win
the election” ’

The class waited attentively as

' Kehl paused and turned to the

chalkboard. After a moment, he
said ruefully, “But, of course, I
was wrong.” The class broke into
laughter.

Kehl, who is 70 and has been
teaching at the University of
Pittsburgh longer than any other
professor, is retiring this spring.
After 45 years of lecturing in
various American history courses,
he has provided his students
with the historical perspective of
one who has lived through
many of the events he lectures
about

Kehl himself was introduced to
politics one day in the first grade,
when he was wearing a Hoover
pin that someone had given
him.

“Some kid pointed at me and
said, ‘He’s for Herbert Hoover,”’
Kehl recalled, “and with that about
six kids hit me and wrestled me
down.”

By the time he entered college,
Kehl said he had recovered from
this event enough to know that
he wanted to teach American
history and politics in the future.
But upon his graduation in 1944,
World War II interrupted his goal.
He was shipped out tothe South
Paciﬁc as a-Navy lieutenantjunior
grade.

Second—in—command of an

amphibious ship that landed men

and supplies on the beaches of
Okinawa and Luzon, a 24-year-
old Kehl returned home in 1946

and was soon hired to teach at _

the Universityof Pittsburgh.

Kehl was inspired early by the
teaching style of Pulitzer Prize-
winning University of
Pennsylvania Professor Roy
Nichols. .

“He was probably one of the
best classroom teachers the U.S.
has ever produced,” Kehl said.
“He was humorous in everything
that he did in the classroom, yet
he was always on the subject.

“In his undergraduate course,
when he would describe
Theodore Roosevelt’s charge up
San Juan Hill, he would wave his
papers in his hand and yell,
‘Charge!”’ Kehl said. “He would
charge down the aisle out of the
classroom and never come back
that day. There would be a
hundred people out in the hall
on that day, waiting for
Theodore’s charge up San Juan
Hill.”

Kehl said he didn’t try to

emulate Nichols’ style but instead -

used aspects of it to influence his
own.

“I felt you had to be able to say
to students that these people in
history were all human,” Kehl
said.

“They had their loves. They
had their hates. They had their
disappointments, and they
showed them.”

Using these clues, Kehl himself
developed a unique classroom

style.

A Kehl lecture has a’ classic
aura, steeped in the passage of
time and tempered by historical
events.

He strides back and forth,
around and behind the desk at
the front of the room, occasionally
tipping his glasses down to glance
at the yellow, cracking pages of
his notes.

Kehl also infuses his lectures
with humor, as his past and
present students reveal. ,

“Kehl was masterful as a
classroom performer,” said
Duquesne law Professor Samuel
J. Astorino, whom Kehl directed
in his graduate studies during the
late 1950s. “He was well prepared
with a dry wittiness that made it
interesting.”

A member of Kehl’s political-
parties class this semester, Alex
Cone, agreed: “The stories he
tells give you a feeling for the
people and the times he’s talking
about,” he said.

Kehl intersperses anecdotes
within his lectures in order to
illustrate the nature of the
historical figures he is discussing.
During last Friday’s class, he
explained the more informal

personality brought to the White
House when Truman took over
after Roosevelt’s death.

According to Kehl, one day
when Truman was displaying the
White House grounds to a group
of reporters, he kept saying that
he had improved various beds of
flowers by “dumping loads of
manure” on them.

“Truman’s wife was following
the group and talking to one of
the reporters," Kehl said. “Finally
the reporter leaned over and
whispered to her, ‘Can’t you get
him to say fertilizer rather than
manure?’ ‘Well,’ she whispered
back to-him, ‘You should have
seen how long it took to get him
to call it manure.”’

Kehl admits to saying the wrong
thing himself sometimes. That,
he said, is why he prefers to teach
politics rather than participate in
it. .
“I never considered going into
politics myself because I don’t
have the personality,” he said. “I
would say things I shouldn't say.”

Although Kehl never attempted
to enter politics, he did become
involved in university
administration for a lengthy
period, serving as‘ administrative
assistant to Chancellor Edward
Litchtield in the late 1950s and
eventually becoming the dean of
the College of Arts and
Sciences.

But problems arose between

Kehl and the next head of the
university, Wesley Posvar.

“After ’69, I knew I wanted no
part of a Posvar administration,”
he said.

“When you become part of

someone else’s institution, you

have to think like the people
who are at the head of the
administration to do your job
well or to be happy doing your
job.” ,_

Unable to think like the new

to full-time teaching, Kehl
dropped most of his admin-
istrative work.

He continued to hold positions
in the Pennsylvania Historical
Association, among other
historical groups.

Today Kehl seems to hold no
regrets about teaching full-time
during the last two decades. He is
as enthusiastic in class as his
former students say he was 35
years ago.

As his last semester draws to an
end, Kehl sat'last week in his

I president and wanting to return .

Forbes Quad office, which '

overlooks the Cathedral of
Learning, the symbol of Pitt that
was built only a decade before he
arrived.

He clasped his hands behind
his head and thoughtfully
summarized his career.

“I stepped off the deck of a
ship and into the classroom,” he
said, “and I never left.”

A university placement official
has received an award for writing
one of the 10 best articles of 1991
in The National Business
Employment Weekly.

Patricia B. Carr, assistant to the
director in the University

-_Placement Servic, won the

I

magazine's Top 10 Award for her
article, “Tips on Working With an
Inept Interviewer.” This is the
second time Carr has won the
Top 10 Award from the magazine,
published by The Wall Street
journal.

“Tips on Working With an Inept
Interviewer” deals with strategies
for keeping interviews on course,
Carr said.

“For the article I talked with
lots of different people throu ghout
the United States who’d had bad
interview experiences; most
people have,” Carr said. “I know
even on our staff and in the

a

[placement] profession in general
lots of people  will start telling
good stories about terrible
things that happened during
interviews.” _

Carr said that the quality ofthe
interviewer isn’t always the cause
of bad interviews.

“I think that it's not that the
person is deliberately out there
to trick you or out to give you a
rough time, but I think some
interviewers are just tired and
they've had a long day or they
have a very unstructured style
that’s really difficult for some
people to deal with.”

Carr also said that people
shouldn't expect interviewers to
have prepared questions or the
ability to draw prospective
employees out of their shells.

“In reality, interviewers are just
like you and me. They get tired;
they get off track, and you have

to help them out as much as you '

can in the interview.”

received a B.A. and master's
degree in education in 1976 and
1981, respectively, from Indiana
University of Pennsylvania. She
earned a Ph.D. in higher
education administrative and
policy studies from Pitt in 1989.

At the placement center Carr
performs administrative duties,
preparing reports and organizing
information.

She works with students and
employers.

“I  work withistudents quite
a bit,” Carr said. “I see graduates

I've been working with some in
humanities and English writing
majors  I’ve,probably worked
with just about every major there
is — the technical and non-
technical side.”

Carr said she helps students to
prepare for interviews, including
doing mock interviews.

Along with administrative work
and helping to place students in
jobs or graduate schools, Carr
said she works with employers.

person that they’re looking for,
and I try to help them find that
person,” she said.

Carr and two other placement
officials, interim director of the
placement center Bob Perkoski
and engineering placement
counselor Kevin Collins, have all
written articles for career
publications.

Carr said, the three have
written articles on their own
and in conjunction with each
other. '

“It started out with two people,
Bob and Kevin, writing,” Carr
said, “and then as time went on 
I wrote with Kevin, I wrote with
Bob, we all wrote by ourselves.”

Carr said that she would like to
put all their articles together for
students who use the placement
center. “I’m real interested in
getting all of our articles together
that we’ve done  collectively
there are about 20 of them
between the three of us,” she
said. 7 ’

Their published work includes
articles on interviewing, reviving

students. In addition to The
National Business Employment

articles in Managing YourCareer
(the college edition of The
National Business Employment

College Placement.

Carr said that she, Perkoski and
Collins also made two series of
training videos with WQEX
television.

“One is a ﬁve-part [series] on
how to telephone employers,”
Carr said.

“The other one, that Kevin
[Collins] and 1 did, was on resume

Protest songs theme
of Dear Friends finale

By F. Paige Heller
For The Pitt News

In their ﬁnal performance of
the season, the University of
Pittsburgh’s Dear Friends will
perform 19th-century American
protest songs. The concert, “Get
Off the Track,” will be held
Sunday, April 26, at 2:50 p.m. at
the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Jean Thomas, director of the
ensemble and American
musicologist, has been involved
with the group ever since its
beginnings 10 years ago. She was
an instrument of its founding
along with Deane Root, curator
of the Stephen Foster Memorial.

The focus of the upcoming
concert is on American protest
songs. These songs have been a
key in the art of persuading
listeners.

“Music played a great role in
the 19th-century reform
movements: abolition, temper-
ance, women’s suffrage and labor
rights, because of its persuasive
powers,” Thomas said. The songs
were inspirational. They were
used to attract people to a cause
as well as to create a sense of
unity within the groups
themselves, she said. -

Set to popular songs and
patriotic hymns, social reformers
spoke out their beliefs through

music. “Pretty soon everyone was
singing along. It’s a pretty effective
way to change minds and hearts,”
Thomas said.

Protest music was at its height
in the 19605, but it is still alive
today. “In a sense, rap music is
the protest music of today,” she
said, because the songs speak
about social conditions of life in
the ’90s.

The performance next week is
a complete stage presentation.
Musicians will be dressed in full
costume. “ltenables the audience
to hear the music in the context
of how it was performed
originally,” Thomas said.

The musicians, all ofwhom are
professionals, are Kate Young,
James Ferla, Robert Rocco, Dave
Krysty and jean Thomas. They
perform four concerts a year.
Each concert holds a different
theme about American, 19th-
century music. These include the
music of the Civil War, Irish
Americans and Victorian
Valentine’s Day and Christmas
melodies. Some of the songs
included in the upcoming concert
include “Old Dan Tucker,” “In
the Sweet By and By,” “John
Brown’s Body” and “My Kentucky
Home.” A popular theme of
protest songs from this era was
the poor working conditions of
the working class.

For The Pill News

Emphasizing women’s issues
and the importance of artistic
expression, Megan Terry, a
feminist playwright and actor
from Omaha, Neb., spoke
yesterday in Pitt's English
department.

“We may not have a big
constituency, but we have big
mouths," Terry said.

Terry called attention to the
political climate in Washington
and said, “With the political
implosion of the Soviet Union,
the government has lost its
historic enemy: the Com-
munists.” As a result, she said
she feels the National
Endowment for the Arts is
casting about for a new enemy
and is treating artists as
“scapegoats.” _

Terry paralleled the women-
operated Omaha Magic
Theater to the federal

government and said, “In 25
years of operation, we’ve never
had a deﬁcit.”

The Omaha Magic Theater
embraces “plays of particular
interest to women” and finds
innovative ways to incorporate
overhead projectors, portable
neon light wands and
eggbeaters into the
performances, according to
Terry.

“Elementary school teachers
come to our shows and see how
we use the projectors and tell
me they never thought of that,"
Terry said.

Using as an example a play
about teenage eating habits,
Terry stressed that the Omaha
Magic Theater's contemporary
material targets ordinary
people rather than
alternative theater aficionados.
“For this play, we advertised

in local Weight Watchers

offices.”
The company goes on tour

Playwright lauds expressive freedom

several times a year, in part
financed by consistent
attendance that reaches 98-
percent capacity in its new,
expanded facility. “Our artists
are thinking bigger and bigger
and finding new uses for
household appliances trying to
get the audience to take a little
vacation in their heads,” Terry
said.

“Anyone who makes the effort
to come out to the theater
anymore is our peer or our
better,” Terry said. “It means
they aren’t at home out in front
of the TV.” _

Regarding newspaper
coverage of the performing
arts, Terry sarcastically
noted-, “More people go to
performing arts in Minneapolis
than sports.”

In reply, a similarly sarcastic
member from the audience
retorted, “It takes longer
to explain to the sports
readers.”

The women. explored ways in

“I won’t let myself use that

themselves.

“Don’t gain weight. Don’t ever

African-American drama, music
dance, classes bold performance

By Rebecca Baker
Stajf Writer

The sounds of bongo drums, wood blocks and
over 60 chanting voices filled a packed Assembly
Room as the Contemporary Black Drama class, the
African Drumming ensemble and the African-
American dance classes performed at the William
Pitt Union last night.

Students from the classes worked this semester to
put on the show, which will be counted as part of
their final grade.

“This has been a great learning experience for
them,’-’ said dance instructor Shona J. Sharif. “For
some of them it is their first time performing in front
of an audience. They’re nervous, but they want to
do it.”

The opening dance, called “Ajaba,” a Yoruba
sacred procession, had some dancers dressed in
brightly colored skirts and headdresses, while

others wore pure white.

Besides music and dancing, several students read
poetry from the Black Renaissance, acted out
scenes from films by Julie Dash and other black ‘

filmmakers and improvised scenes that represented
black culture.

One reading, titled “My Life, My Loves and My
Dreams,” had a performer in the role of a taxicab
driver:

“I take them anywhere they want to go, in

neighborhoods other drivers say they won’t go . 

into.”

In the same reading, a female performer
compared the earthafter a fresh rain to a black
woma,n’s love. - '

Another dramaticpiece, called “Ladies Night V
Out,” had several young men asking two young

women to dance.
The piece showed positive and negative attitudes

LCB cites UBC, Winners

By Heather Gahres
Staﬂ“ Writer

The University Beverage Center and Winners restaurant were
charged with selling alcohol to minors, according to the
Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement
(LCB).

UBC was given administrative charges for sales to minors on
both Friday and Saturday. There were 11 minors cited for
possession at UBC. A person was arrested on Friday night for
selling alcohol to minors, and two. people were arrested
Saturday night for furnishing alcohol to minors, according to the
liquor-control board's reports.

The LCB patrolled the Oakland area due to continuing
complaints from residents. The patrols began at 6 p.m. and

— continued until 3 a.m. on April 10 and 11.

Over 100 minors were also cited for the possession,

consumption or transportation of alcohol, and six people were

' arrested for selling alcohol to minors, LCB officials said. Most of

the citations were given to people at apartment parties in South
Oakland.

Both UBC and Winners refused to comment on the charges.

Pitt study has police use cardiac kits

_ By Vincent Gadrix
Ustaﬂ" Writer

Along with protecting residents
from crime, the police
departments of seven South Hills
communities are now equipped
to save people from sudden
cardiac death.

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s division of
emergency medicine is
conducting a one-year study of
the use of automated defibrillation
by police officers in out-of-
hospital cardiac-arrest cases.

Sudden cardiac death is the
leading cause of mortality in the
United States, according to Dr.
Vince Mosesso, assistant professor
of medicine and principal
investigator in the study.

He said many cardiac cases are

caused by ventricular fibrillation,
a condition in which the muscles
of the heart ﬂutter, preventing
the heart from pumping
blood.

“The normal electric
coordination of the heart
essentially gets screwed up. The
heart is not pumping blood. The
brain, kidneys and other body
tissues do not receive blood or
oxygen,” he said.

Mosesso said that studies found
that if a person who has suffered
ventricular ﬁbrillation is shocked
within five minutes using a
defibrillator, survival rates
increase with no significant
damage to the heart or brain.
Patients can suffer permanent
brain damage if their heart is not
shocked out of its irregular rhythm
within five minutes.

He said a review of police and
emergency—medical services
records indicated that police units
arrive within two to four minutes
of dispatch on over 50 percent of
calls.

In this study police officers
who have CPR certification along
with four—hour training in the use
of the defibrillator will be able to
increase a victim's chances of
escaping serious brain damage.

Officers follow strict protocol
when using the deﬁbrillators and
only use the device prior to the
arrival of an advanced life support
EMS unit, which then takes charge
of the patient’s care.

The study is being conducted’

in Baldwin Borough, Bethel Park,
Castle Shannon, Dormont, Mt.
Lebanon, South Park and Upper
St. Clair.

spend the money of our society
on these things,” she said.

Fulani said every American
should receive a free, quality
education, from kindergarten to
the post—graduate level.

She told the audience to look at
the kind of money‘ that is spent
on education and compare it to
the amount spent on defehse.
She asked where the country’s
priorities are.

“The people of this country
should decide how they want
their money spent,” Fulani said.

Like the box on tax forms. that
can be marked if one wants to
donate one dollar to a charity,
Fulani said this idea should be
expanded to a larger scale.
Constituents should be able to
mark off it they want their money

to go to defense, health care,
housing programs or other
programs.

“The decisions need to be made
through democracy,” Fulani said.

“Certain institutions need to
take heed to these words of free
education. They must understand
institutions can’t exist without
students. With tuition hikes going

up more and more, black people A

are being left out even more.
They say they want to see more
black students enrolled in the
institution, but the only policies
they have are reactionary. When
we start making noise is the only
time they act,” political-action
chairperson of the Black Action
Society Darryl Wiley said.

“She seems to be looking out
for the interests of the masses of
black people,” Wiley said.

with the issue at hand,” Ernhart
said.

The accusations against
Needleman stem from Ernhart
and Scarr’s analysis of raw data
from Needleman’s 1979 study
about the effects of low—level lead
exposure on children’s
intelligence. The study has been
used by the Environmental
Protection Agency to set
guidelines for maximum levels of
safe exposure _to lead.

Ernhart and Scarr were
permitted access to Needleman’s
data in September of 1990. The
two were testifying for the lead

industry, while Needleman was
the govemment’s opposing expert
witness. After studying the data,
they noted what they considered
serious research errors in the data.

“The flaws that we saw are
serious. The investigators acted
in ways that are contrary to
common research practices,
Ernhart said. “Investigators did
not report results that failed to
support Needleman’s
hypothesis.”

Ernhart and Scarr prepared a
report identifying the problems
they saw with the experiment.
They then forwarded their report
to the National Institutes of Health

after a failed attempt by the
Department ofjustice to prevent
Ernhart and Scarr from disclosing
the report.

“We saw sufficient evidence of
misrepresentation of data. We
felt it necessary to report this to
NIH,” Scarr said.

Ernhart added the she and Scarr
did not have enough time to
critically analyze the raw data.
They were prohibited from
photocopying any data, forcing
them to hand-copy areas where
they saw discrepancies. She
added they were asked to leave
and discontinue their analysis.

“We cannot guarantee the

accuracy of our report due to our
inability to thoroughly examine
the Needleman research data,”
Ernhart said.

In his opening statement,
Needleman questioned the
charges being brought against
him.

“I do not feel I have a set of
specific charges against me, and
therefore I cannot answer the
charges,” Needleman said. ‘‘I have
been accused under a vague
section of the integrity policy,
charged with engaging in
practices that severely deviate
from the normal.”

Needleman said that although

there were small errors inhis

research technique, they were

minimal and failed to effect the in

outcome of the experiment. He
added the EPA found his work to
be satisfactory.

The hearing will continue today

as both sides continue to present ”

witnesses.

After the hearings are complete,

the board, composed of Pitt
faculty, will make confidential
recommendations for disciplinary
action, if necessary, to George
Bernier, dean of —

School of Medicine. Needleman
will then have 10 days to respond
to the recommendations.

Opportunities stiflzci ’

More difficult than any final or any term paper, higher
education in Pennsylvania as well as throughout the
United States continues to become increasingly off—lirnits
to high-school graduates.

This year tough times will fall upon hundreds of
Pennsylvania high-school students who are making the
momentous decision of picking a university or college to
attend in the fall. '

Upcoming cuts in higher education by the state of
Pennsylvania will send tuition climbing. No significant
relief is to be expected from the federal government,
either. State funding cuts will not only cause current

students’ tuition to increase; it will also restrict education

opportunity for high-school graduates. - ,
This year the Pennsylvania State System of Higher
Education placed a cap on enrollments at state-owned
universities and limited the number of out-of-state
applicants significantly. With the increases in enrollment,
Pennsylvania schools have high enough teacher-student
ratios. Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey has put $461.6

, million earmarked for campus repairs on hold, pending

a shortage of state funds. ,
Tuition at Pennsylvania’s state-owned colleges and
universities is significantly lower than the over-$4,000

. cost to attend the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State

University. At the state-owned schools, tuition for
Pennsylvania residents is $2,628. Universities in Slippery
Rock and Edinboro are capping incorning—student
enrollment. Students unable to afford Pitt or Penn, notto

‘mention the expensive private colleges, face hardships.

This is not surprising. For over a decade, priorities in
Washington have shifted; education, as well as most
domestic issues, have not received attention. '

Bob" Watson, dean of academic services, told The

 Rittsbugb Post—Gazette, “Unfortunate1y,'we are denying

students from coming to Slippery Rock who are qualified
to do.college—level work because what we have to do is
decide, from among 4,400 or 4,500 applicants, which of

_ those is the most qualified.”

Disadvantaged students will be the most severely
impacted. University education should not be a privilege
for the affluent. ' \ ‘

In yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Kerry L. Moyer,’
director of research and information technologies for the
State System of Higher Education, predicted a bleak
outlook for high-school graduates in the future. “From
1995 to the rest of the decade, the number of high-school
graduates is going to jump almost as much as it recently
dropped. If were feeling tremendous pressure now with
the low number of high-school students, we’re going to
feel tremendous pressure eight years from now.”

Action on and access to education must become issues
in the upcoming elections. Without a firm commitment,
candidates will opt to wrap themselves in the rhetoric of
championing educational opportunities while never
planning to fund proposals.

I feel as if I’m dying. No, not because of graduation
and the prospect of leaving Pitt, but because I did
the college thing in fouryears — not seven or 10
or 23. I guess that makes me an endangered species
of some sort. ' I ‘ ‘  X‘ _ '

Generally, columnists talk about the things they
see. And generally, they give you their opinions
with an ‘‘I don’t care what you think” attitude. So I
won’t depart from age-old customs in this, my final
installment from the fourth floor.

to eat at more places, especially for breakfast, but

since I usually don’t believe in breakfast, it never

happens. ' ' _ '
Being one who never has a 100—percent positive

outlook, I’ve just got to rail Pitt and Pittsburgh for ‘

a few things, too.

— The continual joke called the registration
process. One thing I’ll miss dearly, I assure you.

+ A-P-A-T-H-Y. I’ll bet half the people reading
this didn’t make it past the second 

— The never—ending rain. I realize this isn’t, say,

was put off by their ‘attitudes
when I first got here, and in four

here I’ve done some good things
and some bad things, but there were plenty of
things that stuck out. So if you’ll accept my brazen
notion of being able to tell you what to do, I’ll offer

up some of the things which make Pittsburgh — ,

and Pitt — a bit more tolerable,-beginning with

‘things to do here at school. -

First, everyone on campus should take a class
with communications Professor Ted Windt. I was
fortunate enough to take two, and I wish Ivhad
taken more. Windt is the rare kind of professor who
cares more about students than about academia.
After years of relentless, droning hours of lectures,
Windt is, atthe very least, a refreshing re-minder that
academicians don’t have to be academic at all. He
is a real human being with emotions and everything,
and that’s why I have a lot of respect for him.

Other profs who get props include Lester Olson,
teacher of the feared Rhetorical Criticism class, and
Thomas Kerr, for Freedom of Speech and Press. If
you're vaguely interested in those sorts of things,
I’d recommend taking one of those courses.

Enough for the course guide; let's move on to
some of the enjoyable things I’ve experienced here:

—Jazz shows at Manchester Craftsman’s Guild on '

the North Side. Every year somebody over there
signs up some major artists for a great series of
shows that no one in Oakland ever seems to hear
about '

—Jazz in particular. While Pittsburgh’s scene isn’t
the best, it’s not bad for a casual fan. And there are
some great undiscovered talents here.

— Primanti Brothers. Need Isay more?

— Uncle Sam’s. The pizza cheese steak is my
personal fave.

Come to think of it, I’ve really enjoyed eating in
Pittsburgh, and the culinary aspect just might be the
one I’ll miss the most. Some restaurants you should
check out: Max & Erma’s (Downtown — I haven’t

eaten at the one in Shadyside), Mallorca on the -

South Side (slightly offbeat but really good) and, of
course, the Grand Concourse’s Sunday Brunch at
Station Square. Any place that throws you a ton of
food and some music with it is OK by me. Someday
‘I’ll dine at Angel’s Corner on Atwood, if it kills me.
Ijust haven’t gotten there yet. Of course, I wanted

years I’ve utterly failed to

‘understand what goes through their minds. Other 5

people in other cities don’t act this way, folks.

— Forms. Pitt has provided mewith an invaluable
service by preparing me for all the red tape I’ll
encounter elsewhere in life by burying me in tons
of useless forms. Thanks, and could somebody
pick up the seven tons of trash in my room?

— The generally caring nature of Pitt. Hey, I know
this is a big school, but should I really be getting
alumni notices and letters asking for money before
I graduate? It’s a good thing I kept track of when I’m
graduating," because I have no confidence in the
administration’s ability to do it. '

- The support (or lack thereof),of music at Pitt.
In four years I’ve seen more than my share of
students either leave or discontinue a possible A

career in music because of the reputation of and?

dearth of support for the music department.

- The amazing amount of people who will
believe anything, no matter what. Faith is one
thing; blind faith is another. For a reference, see
Pittsburgh sports fans.

Things I’ll never miss, besides the registration
process: <

— Classes in the Cathedral. Would someone
please tell the faci1ities—management people that
most modern buildings are able to — get this —
keep their classrooms at a stable room temperature?

—— Hills and the cold. These two factors alone have

practically determined the location of my graduate  ,_
school (Avg. temp. in Gainesville, Fla.: 70.1 degrees). ‘W

— Finally, I’ll never miss 8 o’clock classes, mostly
because I never took any.

To round things out, things I will miss:

— Being able to participate in campus activities,
especially singing.

I’ll never forget some of the people I’ve met:
some good, some bad. I’ve made some memories,
none of which I expect to last for long. As Woody
Allen put it, “I don’t want to achieve immortality

through ‘my work. I want to achieve it through not  "

dying.”
Well spoken.

Oh, the woes of our times.
They continue to build upon one
another, suffocating free thought
and promoting venality. What to
do? -

-Given the anti—politics
sentiment that has been the ’92
American bandwagon, I was
trying to figure out why it was
that I haven’t been alive when
there was a really spectacular
candidate for president.

Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Dukakis
—— just to name a few — all claim
or claimed to have a plan for the
betterment of America, but really
none had a cause that they
successfully championed into
progress in society.

Many would argue that it is the
nature of politics that keeps

The ethical compromises, the
rigorous campaign and the fact
that simple experimentation with
marijuana is enough to cast a
shadow on someone’s ability to
run the country are just some of
the reasons that keep people
from running.

I would argue another reason:
America doesn’t want a leader in
the White House.

People don’t appear to want a
visionary, or else there would be
a demand for one. Bill Clinton
and George Bush would not be
the frontrunners in a presidential
election if America demanded
better from its leaders. Scholars
would replace men like Jesse
Helms. Empassioned pleas for

social reform would replace

A democracy is based upon the
notion that the people know what
they want and get what they

Scot
Ross

deserve, and obviously America,
for a great part, has gotten what
it deserves. High unemployment,
a repression of civil liberties and
legislated morality are the results
of an American slumber over the
last decade.

When people say that’s enough,
things will change.

-Manuel Noriega’s conviction
on eight counts for everything
from drug trafficking and
conspiracy to racketeering and
money laundering. This is a good
example of George Bush’s typical

-handling of a domestic problem.

The horrors of drug abuse are
without question. But the
ramifications of a president using
military troops to bring a foreign
leader to face our justice system
are typical of the skewed logic of
Bush. Drugs will not be eliminated

definitely not the way to go. Our.

judicial system is not without
flaws, but in theory it is one of
history's finest. It only becomes

perverse when politicians and

pundits manipulate it for votes
and power.

-The process of the disclosure
that Arthur Ashe has AIDS is not
a failure of the press. The problem
is that people continue to view
the disease with a stigma. AIDS is
a tragic affliction not a punishment

competent people from running.

Pro-choice

The Pitt News often mentions the “pro—
choice majority.” But because the phrasing

‘ of questions significantly affects the
outcome of opinion polls, to get an accurate
assessment of the public’s views on
abortion, it is necessary to compare many
surveys from different sources. According
toJames A Davis, “General Social Surveys,
1972-1985,” analysis of 14 years of surveys
and other research reveal that while around
98 percent of abortions “are performed for
social, non—medical reasons  77 percent
‘ of the American public opposes permitting”

those abortions. David Reardon notes that ,

most ‘polls show about 20 percent of
Americans to be strictly pro-life and 20 to
'25 percent strictly pro—abortion, while

,“Fifty—five to 60 percent would limit

abortion to specific circumstances,
particularly the ‘hard cases.”’

Regardless of which side has majority
support, abortion should be decided on its
merits. The truth IS,‘ abortion is not a
question of “reproductive rights” but of
reproductive responsibility. A pregnant
woman has already reproduced, and a
new life has been created — a life that
should be protected. Rather than fighting
for women’s / emancipation from
responsibility, the pro-abortion movement
should be directing its resources against
the real injustices: rape, sexual harassment
and lack of opportunity.

Palestinian situation reconsidered
After reading the [letter] by T ambi Katieb,
“Israeli’s actions undermine human rights,”
I was shocked to see the ignorance of the
average college student. Mr. Katieb has
made very outlandish assumptions in his

article. First of all, if you had cared to see .

what this “Palestinian reaction” was I
believe that you would be quite appalled.
The Palestinians had rocket bombed a
peaceful civilian community from the
Golan Heights; To me and probably the
rest of the sane world, attacking a civilian
community is a terrorist act. There is
nothing wrong with the assassination of a
terrorist organization leader. Is taking 13
lives of innocent civilians and wreaking
terror in northern Israel the actions of a
peaceful organization? You claim that is a

lie. Face reality: There were 13 documented.

deaths. If this is, as you put it, “military
action by the Zionist regime simply to
demoralize and dehumanize the
Palestinians,” face reality and don’tblindly
make judgments. The action taken by
Israel was a reaction to the terrorist acts
which they had received. Wouldn't you
retaliate if someone was attacking your

political rhetoric.

majority inconsequential in abortion debate

home? There would have been no actions
taken by anyone if there was no preemptive
strike by the Palestinian organization.

Now recently the Hezbollah ﬁre-bombed
an Israeli convoy carrying food and
medicine. There were no war materials in
the convoy. The only point in doing this is
to stir more havoc in Northern Israel.

If you believe that the U.S. backing of
nations who have been attacked by terrorist
organizations is wrong, then your views
are insane. The only reason for the recent
lash by Israel was because of the Hezbollah
attacking innocentcivilian communities.

Virginity exposed
Ed Kichline’s article on sex, college and
virginity was certainly naive. Being HM
(heterosexual monogamous) and a former
practicing virgin through my undergraduate
career, I never noticed that my “dating
pool” was “awful small.” There were (and
still are) plenty of virgins, pretty ones at
that, on campus. Also, there were as many
actively abstaining non—virgins on campus
who realized that their previous sexual

encounters were mistakes and had no.

This article focuses

right” and the
“[woman’s] bodily integrity and privacy.”
The weakness of this approach lies in that,
biologically and genetically speaking, the
embryo/fetus in the mofher’s womb is not
pan‘ of her body.

The woman does have a right to choose
—— she has “reproductive freedom” —
before and until she is pregnant. After
conception, however, the embryo/fetus
is, scientifically, a separate entity.

At approximately three weeks after
conception, the heart begins beating. (An
EKG can be done as early as 7 1/2 weeks.)
Six to seven weeks after conception, the
fetus’ ﬁngerprints are formed. All bodily
organs and systems are in place and
functioning 10-12 weeks after conception.
From this time until birth (or later, in the
case of some systems, such as the
reproductive), they grow mainly in size
with relatively little substantive refinement.

From the moment of conception, the

parent which form the 46 chromosomes of
the new human.

It should, be pointed out that the
heartbeat, measurable in the third week, is
a legal sign of life in human beings.
Furthermore the ﬁngerprints, distinct after
two months, later will serve as a form of
legal identity. This new human is not part

promiscuous); neither ' are they

» exceptionally horny. The same could be

said about virgins. I’ve known virgin/non-
virgin couples who abstained until
marriage. They had the same challenge as
my wife and I in conquering premarital
sexual temptations. Regardless of
experience (sexual or otherwise), seriously
dating couples have “conflicts between
principles.” It’s called growing up, and I
can’t see Mr. Kichline’s linkage to virginity.
Ed’s populational approach (“the odds
are not in [the virgin’s] favor”) does not
take into account some cruel realities ofa
promiscuous population. Persons that have
had sex in their teens with a number of
partners are likely [to] have received and
transmitted a number of [sexually
transmitted diseases], including the AIDS
virus. If they have acquired HIV during
their teen years, they may not be diagnosed
positive until after college. If you have
weekly sexual encounters with an HIV-
afﬂicted person, assuming you use a 99-
percent effective condom, over a year you
will have acquired a S0—‘percent chance of
being exposed to the virus. The everybody-

does—it excuse is now a strong argument .

for abstinence.

So if you’re still a virgin, Ed, don’t use
your article as an excuse for promiscuity.
If you’ve denied your sexuality by tossing
your virginity, try to recoup your losses
and work on a life—long commitment with
your “lover.”

And if you're promiscuous, I hope you
and your partners will still be around in 10

-years to tell me what I’ve' missed.

Traditions valid
In Mondays article, “Traditional sexual
mores reassessed,” the author addressed’
the problems of the “traditional” marriage
in American society. As with any problem
where an individual has a choice, he can
either hold fast to his personal beliefs e
religious or otherwise — and act to
eliminate the problem, or he can fold to
accommodate it, using whatever means
necessary to justify it. l...l
The author also makes various statements

describing sex as a-primary concern of .

marriage. While many people also think
that love is an important consideration,

we should also ponder the puvpose of.

marriage. Next to the individual, the family
is the smallest societal unit. "Improper
behavior in this institution can cause
individual and societal misery. A healthy,
“natural, normal” sex life should take place
— but inside of marriage. This possibility
is undermined by creating an unstable
perception of marriage through adultery,
fornication, illegitimate or wedlock children
and the plethora of modern, dysfunctional
families in the U.S. The author also justifies
the ever-popular test-drive theory of sex
before marriage on the grounds of the
possibilityof a mysterious “complete sexual
incompatibility,” whatever that is. (Are we
so obsessed?!) '

As with the issue of sex education, it is
the responsibility of parents to provide for
the children through knowledge and
example. Failure to do so is the mistake of
the parents and not an excuse for the
children. Same goes for the “traditional”
ineptitude of the Judeo—Christian method
of ignoring the reality of the problem by
giving unrealistic options and not providing
an intelligent upbringing to avoid falling
victim to the worship of oursexual desires.

Finally, saying that it is “ludicrous” not
to have sex before marriage because you

want to save your children from a “broken _

home and a damaged family" is like stealing
money from your mother and then saying
that you were concerned that she might

have used it to go buy crack. Have these _
problems inflicted the divorce rate on our

country, or has the divorce rate inflicted us
with these problems? It is important to
keep our trusts with the opposite sex and
to keep our errors to ourselves. We should
not propagate our personal ideas (of
marriage), whether in a relationship, in
society or in the media, overour duty to be
just in our dealings with others.

All-American Hovan

  named Athlete of Year

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer

One of the finest wrestling careers in
Pitt history closed last month, when
Scott Hovan took the mat for the final
time. I

Hovan didn’t leave Oklahoma City as
an NCAA champion, but his relentless,
attacking style and intense spirit
propelled him to accomplishments that
will be forever etched in the annals of
Pitt wrestling. .

Now that it’s all over, Hovan said he
has no regrets about the time he spent
wrestling at Pitt. In fact, given the
chance to do it all again, Hovan said he
wouldn’t change a thing.

“I feel really good about my whole
career at Pitt, academically and

athletically,” Hovan said. “I was always

striving to be a national champion, and
even though I haven’t achieved it, the
whole effort and excitement of it all
was definitely worth it.

“Going beyond just academics and

athletics — just going to school here at

' _the University of Pittsburgh _— I think

I’ve learned a lot about myself and the
kind of personl want to be,” Hovan
said.

“He set the pace out there. \We’re
gonna miss him,” Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “He’s done a heckuva
job. His forte is his explosiveness; he
just hates to lose. He likes to get out
there; he loves the limelight.”

Hovan’s storied career culminated
last month, when he placed fourth in
the 158—pound weight class at the NCAA
Championships in Oklahoma City,
earning All-American status for the
second time in his career.

“I was beaten by two better guys this
year at nationals,” Hovan said. “I was
hoping I could put together a good
tournament and beat them.”

“In wrestling nobody votes us All-

American — we earn it,” Stottlemyer I

said. “That’s what Scott did. He went
out and earned his two All-American

and rose from the unseeded ranks at
nationals to garner_All—American honors.
Two-time runner—up at E\WL tournament.
Closed out Pitt career with a record of 78-
43-2.

Matt Brady— In his first season, Brady
was instrumental in leading the Pitt men’s
swimming team to its 10th straight Big East
title. At the league meet, Brady posted six
individual or team first—places, including a
personal—best time in the 200 individual
medley.

reasons

to celebrate end
of hockey strike

Everybody else in the world
seems to have done their own
David Letterman Top 10 lists
by now, so here’s mine: the
Top 10 reasons why it’s great
to have NHL hockey back
after the first—ever NHL players’
strike. -

Jim Clark

10. I was getting tired of
seeing re-runs of the “Bobby
Knight chair-throwing
competitiong’; You know it's
bad when that was among the
top sports stories of the day.

9. The hockey players are
rich enough already. I know
that I would have a tough time
living off a job where the
average salary is in the vicinity
of $300,000 a year. Maybe
they should get real jobs
(except for PAT bus drivers.
Their $33,000 a year is almost
as bad as the NHL players’
salaries.)

8. The owners are too
dishonest. The NHL is a rich
league when it wants to be
(like when expansion teams
wanted in only last year). It’s
also a poor league when it
wants to be (like when the
strike was still going on).

7. It was nice to see the
Penguins in the playoffs one
year. Two years in a row is

going to be unbelievable.

6. Regu1ar—season WLAF
games just‘don’t cut it when
compared to’ NHL playoff
games.

5. Hockey ﬁghtsemake for
good viewing. Say what you
must about them, but I would
much rather see a Bob Probert/
Marty McSorley fight then a
bench—clearing brawl in
baseball that results because
of some arrogant, whining
pitcher who is upset because
the last batter he faced just
drilled a pitch out of the park.

4. It’s much more appealing
to watch generally even-
headed hockey players, who
average only $500,000 a‘ year-,
in comparison to the ego-
maniac baseball players, who
average $1 million a year and
then still complain about not

being paid enough.

5. The Pens being in the

playoffs for the second week ‘

in a row while the Flyers have
missed for three straight years
is something to hold over your
friends from Philly.

2. Judging by the way that
the Penguins ‘played before
the strike, it looks as if they
may actually have another
deceht year in the playoffs in

their quest to defend the W
' Stanley Cup. '

Steve Lewis labeled the
competition “grandiose.” Over
150 Division I schools competed.

junior Carmela Mariani placed
sixth with a time of 17:03.79 in
the S,000—meter race and was
an ECAC qualifier. Laura
O’Donnell placed eighth in the

' 3,000—meter event, setting a
school record in the process.
The junior was an ECAC
quahﬁer

The 10,-000-meter race saw

juniorjennifer I-Irach finish fifth
- and senior Stacy Wyzykowski
finish eighth. Hrach had a time
of 37.25 seconds and
Wyzykowski a time of 37.49.
Judy Facey, a junior, set her
personal-best time in the 1,500-

meter event with a time of 4:51.

In the 4x800 event, the team
of Monica Hockaday, Katina
Miles, O’Donnell and Facey
finished ECAC qualiﬁers with a
fifth—place ﬁnish and a time of
9:13.19. The 4x400 race saw
the team of Lekeya Smith,
Hockaday, Kim Blair and Ronise
Crumpler finish fifth with an
ECAC-qualifying time of
3:40.84. Crumpler went on to
post a qualifying time of 54.60
in the 400—meter race. She
finished eighth in that event.

The 100-meter hurdles saw
Staci Suggs, Sidney Cooper and
Blair finish with respective times
of13.98, 15.58 and 14.24. None,
however, were ECAC

At a separate competition held
at Carnegie Mellon, first—year
student Stacey Roth set a school
record in the hammer throw
with a distance of 134 feet. Roth
also competed in the shot put,
discus and javelin events and
posted respective distances of
338", 950 and 80'. Also at CM,
junior Joanne Warner won the
shot put, the javelin and the
discus events. In the discus
event, she set a’ school record
with a distance of 147’0. Kelly
Letchenfield performed at the
shot put and discus and tallied
distances of 307.5" and 90’0,
respectively.

After seeing the way that his
team has performed so far this
season, Lewis said he was
pleased with the balance on his
squad. _

“Few teams in the East have a
balanced team from the 10,000
down to the long jump,” Lewis
said.

Crew continues success at [aSalle Invitational

By Brian Gallagher
Staff W1'iter

The Pitt Crew team hit the
Jersey shore over the weekend
(well, the man-made Cooper

Reservoir, to be exact) for the

LaSalle Invitational in Camden,
N.J.lt returned with two top efforts
from its familiar suspects, plus
several notable performances
from its novice boats.

In what is becoming an absolute
given in their performances, the
Panthers’ varsity men’s heavy 4
boat once again captured top
honors, taking a gold in the 2,000-
meter final.The women’s heavy 4
boat also fared quite nicely, thank
you, finishing second to a
powerful Vassar squad.

The men’s open 2 boat ofTodd
Ridenour and: Bert Losken

followed its third-place finish at
Johns Hopkins with a second-
place showing.

As far as the novice-division
competition, Pitt lassoed in a first-
place finish, courtesy of the men’s
4 boat of Shawn Ellis, Curt Miller,
John Whiteford, Ron Schmoll and
Coxswain Jeff Kamis, while the
women’s 4 boat of Jen Sari, Jen
Buck, Nancy Zebo, Michelle
Zielinski and Coxswain Beth
Gingrow placed a solid third.

Pitt head Coach Joel Kehm
noted the improving efforts of
the novice boats against tough
competition as proof that his team
will be a force to be reckoned
with by the time Dad Vails roll
around. ' _

‘‘It was a great performance by
the crew and evidence that we
are not a one—boat team but a

well-balanced rowing power,"
Kehm said. |
While that may be the Case, the
Panthers still receive a majority of
their “power” from their varsity
heavy 4 boats. '
In the women’s heavy 4
Competition it was a matter of
better versus best — Pitt being
better.Vassar finished 20 seconds
ahead of the Pitt boat, with
Richmond taking third. The
Brewers’ decided advantage in
upper—body strength was the
difference in the race, according
to Pitt crew member Dana Jaros.
“We were lacking in upper-
body strength, and Vassar took
advantage of that,” Jaros said.
“This week at practice we’ll do a
lot of heavy lifting for the rest of
the season and Dad Vails.
“When we improve our

sport. I’m sure that it’s the favorite
sport of some of you. To me,
that’s reason enough that it’s great

' that this strike is finally history.

It’s only a week into the season,
but the Pirates are starting where
they left off last season (before

the playoffs). This shows that I
defense and pitching wins games. '

With the exception of Barry
Bonds, the Pirates haven’t hit

-worth a damn, yet they are 4-2.

The Mets, in contrast, are 2-5.
This is a power—filled lineup with
the likes of Bobby Bonilla,
Howard Johnson, Eddie Murray,
Dave Magadan and‘ Vince
Colemanllowever the -only
player that can play defense out
of this bunch is Murray, and he’s
well past his Gold Glove—winning
days. Bonilla is a natural first
baseman playing right field.

  

:Johnson._is a shortstop playing

Center field. Magadan is a first
baseman playing third. Coleman
is a Center fielder playing left
field.A team with this many

players playing out of position is
going to lose. The Pirates may
not be in first at the end of the
season, but count on this: The
Mets will finish behind the Pirates.

' strength, we’ll be fine. Overall, I
, think we rowed much better [than
' in the last two weeks],” she added.
Jaros noted the competition, .

which included the likes of host
LaSalle, Villanova, St. John's and
Old Dominion, was far and away
the crew’s stiffest yet.

“This was the toughest
competition so far,” Jaros said. “It
showed us where we stand so far
[this season]. I think we are in
pretty good shape, but we still
have a lot of room to improve.

“On the whole, we rose to the
level of the competition,” she
said.

Rising to the level of
competition was a Concept
unknown to opponents of Pitt’s
heavy 4 boat so far this spring.
Pete Alpern, Bob Falk, John
Dougherty, Matt Precthel and
Coxswain Leanna Hopkins further

entrenched themselves as Pitt’s ’

top boat with a gold medal,
defeating rowing powers Army
and Fordham, which ﬁnished
second and third, respectively.
, “We crushed them,” Hopkins
said. “[Fordham] is pretty strong
[individually], but together as a
unit, they Can’t row.” I
Like the women’s 4, the Panther

men’s performance against_

formidable foes proved valuable

in gaging how the team has _

progressed so far this season.
Besting a Dad Vail finals-
participant like Fordham speaks
volumes on the type of effort the
boat is able to put out.

“It was a good indicator of
where we are,” Hopkins said.
“lPrior to the season] we had no
idea where we were gonna be.

“This win tells us where we’re
heading,” Hopkins said.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April 14, 1992

 

‘Wait 72'! next year’ ozfozfmiliozr CV3/for Piltfoms

As the '91-'92 school season

-comes to an end, let us take a

look at the Panther athletic season.
The football team had a great
start but ran out of gas halfway

, through the season and ended

up 6-5. The Panther basketball
team started out pretty strong as

. well, but like the football team it

ran out ofgas and ended up with
a C+ season as well.

Both teams seem to be on that
cutting edge. If the football team
would have won only one more
game (and most of its losses last
year were extremely close games),
it probably would have gone to a
bowl.

And if the basketball team
would have perhaps won one

Stephen
Fﬁnn

more game, it would have
probably gone to the NCAA
Tournament.

Pitt is part of the Big East
Football Conference now in its
infancy, and that is exciting. We
also have a new athletic director
and even a new chancellor, so
the athletic administration has
cleaned house.

So Pitt athletics is on the right
track, right? Well, lam not so
sure. But thatis OK. And here is
why.

When the football team ended

up “close but no cigar,” what did
Pitt fans say? “Oh well, there is
always next year. But for now
thank God basketball season is
upon us.” And when the
basketball season finished the
same way, what did the fans say?
“Oh well. Wait ‘till next year.” Do
you see a vicious cycle spinning
here? I don’t know about you,
but I am dizzy from riding on this
Panther pinwheel.

I am tired of saying, “Wait ‘till
next year!” I am tired of hoping
the Panthers will once again return
to national glory. If they do, great.
If not, it is not the Panthers’ fault
but rather the fans’ fault for
expecting them to do better than
they are capable of. I think the

best solution is to accept the
Panthers for what they are and
not to compare them with teams
of the past.

I don’t know ‘about you, but
the next time I ﬁnd myself sayin g,
“Wait ‘till next year!” I am going
to stop midstream. I hope you do
the same.

So next time you say, “What
happened to the Panthers?” or
somebody asks you the same
thing, just say that they are alive
and well and living in Pittsburgh.
Because “Wait ‘till next year” is
no different than the sign that
hangs in the local bar that reads,
“Free Beer Tomorrow.”
Tomorrow never comes, and
neither does next year.

Continued from page 14
plaques.”

The senior from Allentown, Pa.,
closed the books with a 31-6
season that saw him ranked in
the top five in the nation all year.
Hovan marched through the
Eastern Wrestling League with a
perfect 7-0 mark before finishing
second at the EWL Tournament.
He became only the 23rd wrestler
in league history to qualify for
NCAAs four times.‘

Hovan showed steady
improvement each year while
compiling three consecutive
seasons of 30-plus wins and a
career mark of 121-36-2.1-Iovan
went 28-14-1 during his first
season and capped that campaign
by being voted to the Freshman
All-American team by Amateur

Wrestling News.As a sophomore
I—Io.van+~._-"went 31-11—1.He
redshirted during the 1989-90
season and returned with a 31-5
junior season in which he took

the EWL title at 158: In addition,
Hovan was the EWL scoring

champion and garnered All--

American honors by finishing
sixth at nationals.

With so many accolades Hovan
found it difficult to pinpoint the
most memorable one, but a few
stood out.

One of the most memorable
accomplishments for Hovan was
winning his first collegiate
tournament, the West Virginia
Open. Another moment that
jumped out for him was the 1991
nationals, when he beat
Michigan’s Sean Bormet in the
quarterfinals.

“To make it into the semiﬁnals
and know I was guaranteed an
All-American as a juhior was a
great feeling,” he said. “I think
the Clarion match (a 22-19 Pitt

win on Feb. 14) was one of the-

biggest as far as dual—meets. It
was definitely the most exciting
accomplishment, as a team, since

/

I’ve been here.”

Hovan made history on Jan. 11
by recording his 100th career
win, a 21-8 major decision over
Clemson’s Chris Danegan. The
victory lifted Hovan to a plateau

-that only two-time national

champion and four-time All-
American Pat Santoro had
previously achieved at Pitt.

Hovan’s list of accomplishments .

also includes EWL Wrestler of the
Week and Pitt’s Most Valuable
Wrestler for 1991.

In addition to that EWL crown,
his victories include a number
of other tournament
championships. Hovan won the
Wilkes Tournament twice, the
West Virginia Open and the Lock
Haven Invitational.

His trademarks were intensity‘

and an extreme dislike forlosing.
Hovan preyed on the opposition
from start to finish, never letting
up until the match concluded.
Stottlemyer said Hovan brought

a great deal of enthusiasm to Pitt
wrestling. ‘

“Scott Hovan is certainly not
boring. He makes wrestling
exciting,” Stottlemyer said.

Hovan will attend graduate

school as part of Pitt’s teaching-

certification program. He said he
aspires to become a graduate
assistant coach for the Panthers
next season. Looking back, Hovan
said he learned many valuable
lessons at Pitt and credited his
teammates for pushing him
ahead.

“I made a lot of close friends.
Everybody’s working for a
common goal. To achieve that
goal you have to push yourself to
the limit,” Hovan said. “You never
do that on your own. Your
teammates are there to push you.
Your coaches, your friends —
you take a little bit from everyone.
It’s especially important in
wrestling when they’re always
there for you.”

\Villis—

sad to see him go for many
reasons. He was the best
interview among all the Big
East coaches. Even though
he dealt with the New York
media quite often, he
remained cheerful and
always put his team above
himself. And he would not
only acknowledge writers,
he would stop and directly
answer them, as if he were
talking to a friend. Now all of
his answers may not have
been the ones that all writers
are looking for, but he took
time and he showed how
much he cares: about people,

about “kids.” -
Looie has constantly talked
about his “kids,” meaning
his players, of course. He
has successfully cultivated a
father—image in a league
which has some of the best
four-letter men in the
business: Jim Calhoun of
UConn and Paul Evans. Looie
was different. “Class” was
the operative word here,

Calhoun or Evans lacks class,
but simply that Looie is the
ideal.’

Carnesecca is . St. Johns,
and yet I always find myself
thinking about the players
first: Mullin, Malik Sealy, et.
al. This is part of Looie’s

. mystique. He elevates his
players and doesn’t take
center stage forihimself. He
is not larger-than-life. Lou
Carnesecca is leaving, and
