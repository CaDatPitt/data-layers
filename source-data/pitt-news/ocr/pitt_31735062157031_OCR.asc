Indifference Follows

Resignatio

A long sizzling gripe-bomb

n Epidemic

exploded in the YMCA. oﬁice

late last week and »pr'ec.ipitated accusations and excusesthat
scratch the surface on the long unanswered question: “\Vhat’s

happened to the Y cabinet?"

. Theentire cabinet meets at a special session at the home of
Frederick L. Broad, Jr., Y executive secretary, tonight in an
attempt to reorganize the governing group.

Midway through the fall semes-9

ter, President Jim. Cochran and
Vice-President Lanny Govic’ re-
signed A their cabinet positions
without adequate explanation of
their action. The Y office too,“ kept
mum on the scandal. A
Then last week Harry Pluebell,
trouble shooter for the Independ-
ent Association and member of
the Y Committee of Management,
let out a torrent of dissatisfaction '
to a group of unsuspecting fresh-

- men at the weekly Y Men’s Club

meeting.
Cabinet Going to Pot

“Our cabinet is more or less go-
ing to pot,”~; Pluebell told the
freshman group. .

Since Frederick Miller left his
fulltime post here for at position
with the downtown sYMCiA, the
cabinet has been in difficulty, ac-
cording to Pluebell.

Once -on the subject, Pluebell
rambled on about how the; cabinet
began to fall apart when Mi1ler’s
influence was goneand there was
no one to goad the group.

‘-‘After Miller's departure Fred.
Broad took over as executive sec-
retary in October. From then‘ the
cabinet‘ -has been functioning un-
satisfactorily.”

Mil1er‘Made Difference

‘Inhis original statement, made
in Broad’s absence from the meet-
ing, Pluebell indicated that since
Miller had ceased to goad cabinet
members, little had been accom-
plished.

Broad countered this statement
with the announcement that he
had followed -the “old idea” until
recently, when he began to have
matters of policy brought up in
meetings.

. The “old idea” was a pat sys-
tem where the cabinet members
would ﬁle into the meeting, the
chairman‘ would call on "each
member for a report on his par-
ticular phase pf Y activity. “Then
they would ﬁle out,” said,Broad.

Independent Association
C-ains Official Sanction

Pitt’s Independent Association received probationary recognition by uuanirrxous vote in
an unusually quiet 85-minute session of the student—faculty Committee on Recognition.

Since this was the second time the Independents had petitioned for recognition. the
chairman, Miss Helen Pool Rush, dean of VVOIII en, requested that Ray Pluskey, president of the
Independents, give a. progress report. This report lIl(ll(3/{lied that the organization now has

To Play Here
For 'Whirl'

With the spotlight centered
around the new look, Ted Weems
and his orchestra will have the
ballerina skirts whirling at the
Junior Prom, Friday, Feb. 27 in
the Main Ballroom and Urban
Room of the William Penn Hotel.
' Famous for his ,“businessman’s
bounce’? which brought his fame
in “Heartaches,” a 1923 revival,
Ted». Weems will come "direct from
a tour which includes appearances
at the Waldorf-Astoria, Palmer
House and Meadowbrook Country
Club.

Efforts are being made to have
Weems appear on one of the local
shows to tell about his secret of
staying on top of the band world.
Couples may expect such noted
personalities as Elmo Tanner, the

Whistler; Shirley Richards, vo-
calist; and Billy Blair, novelty
man.

“The Secretary’s Song,” Weem’s
latest hit will be one of the even-
’ing’s novelties featuring a type-
writer clicking through the entire
song.

Formerly associated with. the
‘Mason-Dixon Seven,” the band
with which he made his first pro-
fessional engagement, Weems
may be remembered as a former
resident of Pittsburgh.

Congress to Choose
Hall of Fame Names

At the last meeting of Student Congress the members appointed
the Hallof Fame nominating committee whose purpose. is to nominate
the -20 outstanding seniors for place in the Hall of Fame.

The Student Congress members did this themselves this year
instead of the regular Student Congress nominating committee be-
cause‘ there was not enough time for the resolution to go through.

Congress picked six junior men, who with three faculty mem-

bers and T. W. Biddle, dean of¢

men, will choose the ten men. It
also appointed six junior women
who will work with three faculty
members and Miss Helen P. Rush,
dean of women, and will nominate
the ten women.

The Junior ’Worthy Committee
chooses the 12 outstanding Juniors
who receive the silver spoon at
Tap Day exercises. Both the
Junior Worthy Committee and the
Hall of Fame Committee are
chosen by Student Congress.

The committee for choosing the
six outstanding Junior women this
year is the same as the Student
Congress Nominating Committee.
They are: the president of WSGA‘;
the president of VVon}_i_e11’s Speech
Association; the president , of

 

WAA; the president of YWCA;
the president of Woman’s Choral;
the president of Pan Hellenic
Council; the president of Mortar
Board; and the highest ranking
woman in publications.

The men’s committee for the
Junior Worthy nominations are:
the president of Men’s Council;
the president of ODK; the presi-
dent of YMCA; the president of
IF Council; the president of E &
M Cabinet; the president of The-
atron; the president of Men’s Glee
Club; the president of Men’s De-
bate; the president of the Band
Association; the editor of the Owl;
the business manager of the News;

Easy questions and satisfactory answers followed until the point
of membership was brought up. Questioning reached perhaps. the
most brisk point during the afternoon as the members of the com-

be sought. The Independents fought off the questions with replies
that seemed to indicate they wanted to follow the rules already es-

Midwikis Gets
Chem. Award

Joseph D. Midwikis, senior in
chemical engineering at the Pitt,

as recipient for the 1948 Harri-

The award was established in
memory of Harrison Collin Bash-
ioum, who served as head of the
chemical engineering department
at Pitt from 1919 until his death
in 1936. The awardee is chosen
on a basis of scholarship, char-
acter, and personality, by vote
of senior chemical engineering
students.

Froshi Mixers
Planned by
WSGA. MC

Freshmen mixer dances make
their bow this afternoon in Ma-
sonic Temple ballroom under the
joint sponsorship of Men's Coun-
cil and WSGA with the express
purpose of cementing relations
between the freshmen men and
the freshmen -women.

Five, such mixer dances are
planned by the joint organizations
to take place on the next ﬁve suc-
ceeding Tuesday afternoons.

“Mixer dances are sponsored
free of charge for freshmen to
give them a chance to know each
other better. Chance acquaint-
ances in class don’t serve this
purpose," states Marjorie Soffcr,
WSGA representative.

Music ~will be furnished by
Pittsburgh’s disk—jockey, Leo Bal-
dizar, who promises the latest
dance tunes by popular bands.
Both fast and slow numbers, ap-
pealing, to ‘all tastes, have been

Gtablished by WSGA and the IF

Council and seek membership at
the same time.

Pluebell interjected “We’re not
ﬁghting fraternities!” At this point
he was reassured that no onehad

made such a claim, and»-.qiiestio~?mt~.~-; .é>:§~«

ing was resumed.
Mrs. Harriett Kohlberger, as-

sistant to the dean of women, stat-  .
ed that “conﬂict seems to be with

Student Congress.” Pluskey quick-
ly ‘denied this, but stated that he
thought blame must be placed for
failure of dances on publicity and
organization. Questioning upon
social events was left, as Pluskey
stated that all social affairs would
be open without discrimination ‘to
fraternity or non-fraternity mem-
bers. '

The discussion was halted tem-
porarily by Audrey Gaul, when
she said she believed the “.
few items that need to be ironed
out could be ironed out by the
group” (i.e. the Independents).

George Lynn, Student Congress
president, asked, “What are your
political ambitions on campus?’*,

Professor Short claimed the
question unfair. “Why not ask
Fraternities what their political
purpose is?”

’ Lynn began to answer when

Betty Welsh interrupted to reply,
thatfraternities had already made.

this clear to Lynn’s original ques-
tion.

“Our main purpose" is social.’

Anything political will grow out
of that,” she said.

No more questions were asked
and the meeting was closed to
visitors and the News representa-
tive.

As he left the room Pluskey
said, “I "am very optimistic and
was before I went in.” '

When the vote was taken it was
the unanimous opinion of the
committee that the Pitt Independ-
ent Association be recognized.

The committee also gave pro-
bationary recognition to three
other groups: the Ski Club. the
Bridge Club, and the Chess Club.
All were recognized unanimously.

, Ticket P,olicy  

The editorial appearing last week concern-
ing parking tickets has promoted considerable
comment around campus. The position taken,
and condoned by many of the parking tibket
holders here, is that the Oakland police should
be consistent about tagging, and they should
attempt to make the parking place situation
clear.

In particular question is the area along
Bigelow Boulevard opposite the Cathedral,
which has a useless continuous yellow line
from Forbes St. to to Fifth Ave. On investiga-
tion, it is found that part of this area is free
for parking, and part isn’t. Just where the line
is drawn is up to individual decision.

The two hour parking limit on many streets
North of the Cathedral leaves a doubt in the
mind of the student who must attend three
classes in succession. Is the two hour limit nec-
essary‘!

Brotherhood Week

Higher education has greater purpose than
the acquisition of a technical skill. The liberal
arts advocates claim that we are well on the
way to losing an ability to think. That colleges

have fallen down in their purpose to teach

mental and spiritual leadership. That the uni-
versities of this country are now producing
scientiﬁc robots.

VVhether the grounds for the claims of the ‘

liberal antagonists are just or not is open to

debate. Whether the American college student .

and graduate of today is broad enough, in his

mental and spiritual backgrounds, to under- .

take his position of responsibilitylin society,
or not, is in the same category.
% I G:

This week has been designated by a world-
c’ombination of Christian and Jewish groups as
brotherhood week. This week has been set
aside as one of tolerance and understanding
among the diverse peoples of the world.

This week, the Jews and Arabs slug it out

-in Palestine; this week, the Hindus and the A

Moslems, and other groups ﬁght for spiritual

V supremacy in India; this week, a group of

   
 

Southern governors have converged on Wash-
ington; this week, the “Communists” and
“capitalists” wage cold war to ﬁght Tru-
man’s "Civil Rights” program: this week is
brotherhood week. ’
I= ¥ '$

If, in no other way, the liberal arts advo-
cates are right, they speak real truth when
they claim tolerance is a forgotten item in
education. If a man can sit through four years
of college graduating with the same prejudices

he had at enrollment, the American college has V
failed its purpose. If we do not teach toler- ‘

ance, wp have no “higher” education.
Brotherhood week has great symbolism for
the college student, on an over all basis, far
greater than for any other group of persons in
the world. If tolerance and its synonym,
brotherhood, have not permeated the minds

of. today's college student, then, ‘the leaders
of tomorrow will be just an incompetant, as -

war minded, as narrow and bigg-oted, as those
men who play games with peoples of the world
today.

Fact or Fiction

The statements appearing in the Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph last Thursday have caused con-
siderable stir both. oﬁicially and unoﬁicially
throughout the University family. As an out-
growth of this supposed release of information
the six members of the reporting committee
and, strangely, the Pitt News have received
the accusing ﬁnger “news leak.”

In neither case, as far as we know, is the
accusation valid. The material printed in the
Sun—Telegraph sems to represent a piece of in-
dividual guesswork combined with a bit of
deductive reasoning. According to George
Lynn, it represented nothing in the way of
actuality.

VVhatever the errors of the report appear-
ing last week, everyone who has given a few
moments thoughts on the subject of Pitt in
athletics awaits the release of the official ﬁnd-
ings. \Vhen this will come in debatable. It must
be reviewed by the University Board of Trus-
tees before it reaches the public.

It is our opinion that the report will con-,

of the members of the Temporary Athletic
Committee, themselves, the report does not

ﬁnd the solution to\ a problem with the facili-
ties and manpower at hand. On this one point
alone, the Committee has shown considerable
intelligence. _ C‘

For one thing, the report is nothing more
than a recommendation. As such, whatever it
says is subject to the veto of the Board. It
would be ridiculous to advise a complete r;
would be ridiculous to criticize ofﬁcialvpolicy

too. . .

The Student View. . a

Student Control Issue i 

     
  

  

On Other Campuses

:3-

By Glenn Beymer

The student government issue is not peculiar to Pitt. It
is found in varying degrees of complexity in colleges and uni-
versities throughout the country. Recently, The Herald, of-
ﬁcial student publication of Fisk university, had students ex-
press their opinions, pro and con, on “Should student govern-

ment be abolished?”

The “pro” side maintained that student government was

a complete, farce, that the faculty:

and administration looked upon
the students as children, allowing
them to go through the motions

of “student government,” indulg-
ing them, but depriving them of.

any real power over student af-
fairs. With the student council
relegated to the position of a “big
entertainment committee” why
not label it as such and have done
with pretense.

“No,” cried the “cons” on the
opposite page, “student goyern-
ment at Fisk, as at allschoolb, has
its faults, but to abolish it would
be disastrous.” The student coun-
cil, they maintained, fulﬁlls its
purpose of acquainting the stu-
dents with the “democratic, legis-
lative process." It -still provides
the best opportunity‘ to develop

leadership among students, an ad-

mittedly important function of
such a body. Finally, said the
“cons," student indifference is as
much at fault as is administrative
red tape. “Interest and intelligent
criticism by students,” they said,
"will rectify many of its faults
Both Have Points

Well, we think each side has
made some telling points. We be-
lieve with the" “cons” that aboli-
tion of student government is‘ not
the answer. The arguments ad-

vanced by the “Cons” ‘are, as far

as they go, sound. Especially im-
portant is the last point concern-
ing student interest and intelli-
gent criticism. If the students are

‘ interested enough to examine their

governing bodies with an eye to

constructive criticism, some pro-
gress undoubtedly can be made.

But what about this protest of
the “Pros” that student represen-
tatives are treated like children,
that actually the whole thing is a
farce. There is, we think, more
than a little truth to the charge.
Part of it is a condition of the
times. The last several years, due
to the veteran inﬂux, has seen/a
noticeable increase in the average
age of the college student. The
more mature students” naturally
resent a faculty or administrative
attitude that regards them as un-
able to cope with problems aris-
ing out of their own government.

Situation Always 

To a lesser degree, however, the
situation has always existed. The
college student, presumably above
the average in intelligence and
ability and approaching complete
maturity, is to a large extent de-
nied by the college authorities an
opportunity to govern his own af-
fairs. We do not advocate and
have not advocated the assump-
tion by a student governing body
of those powers which are by their
nature an inherent, part of uni-
versity administration. lWe have
advocated and will continuevto ad-
vocate the establishment of a stu-

dent congress with full power to.

deal with all issues that are clear-
ly student in ' nature and extent
without any form of outside dicta-
tion.

Liberal Powers Make

A Gestapo

of FBI

ANN ARBOR, Michlf the Federal Bureau of Investigation
uses all the powers granted to it under the government ’s loy-
alty program itmay tend to become another Gestapo, H. L.
Bretton, of the University of Michigan’s political science de-

partment, said here recently.

I

Bretton, a former member of the OSS in, Germany, said

that the powers to collect data on federal employees by on-'7

disclosed means and to dismiss9*

employees of the government
without -i confronting them with
their accusers held great potential
danger for the exercise of civil
liberties.

“The Gestapo under .1-Iimmler
was successful," Bretton said, “be-
cause there were no legal re-

straints on it, and it had unlimited
scope. The principal difference be-
tween the Gestapo and the FBI
operating under its new powers is
in the assumed motives of J. Ed-
gar Hoover.”

“There is no public check on the

methods used by the FBI in se-.
I curing information about govern-

ment employees," Bretton said.

“By including political as well as,
criminal acts under the jurisdic-

tion of the FBI we are_.doing the
same thing that enabled Himmler
to become such a big power in
Germany.”

Bretton stated that the argu-
ment that the government acted

with as much discretion as a pri-
K vate corporation in selecting its-

employees’ is not valid. “By its
nature and. position in political op-
erations, the government cannot
be considered a private corpora-

, tion."

The alternative to the present

i loyalty check program, according

to Bretton, is the continuance of

’ the FBl’s investigations along its
Hlfg

usual, “constitutiona1" lines.
the FBI has evidence that cannot
be released for reasons of national
security, it should keep its suspect
under surveillance until it gets
evidence presentable in court,” he

A recent bill, signed by President Truman on Feb. 14,
1948, increases subsistance allowances for ex-GI college stu-
dents, providing an increase from $65 to $75 monthly for stu-
dents without dependents, and an increase from $90 to $105
for students with one dependent.

Scheduled to become effective April 1, 1948, the bill had
been hanging ﬁre since the terlnination of the 79th session of

Congress.

Vet students now receiving gov-
ernment allotment checks are ad-
vised not to Contact VA officials
or university departments. All
additional paper work will be
handled automatically by VA per-
sonnel.

The increased subsistance meas-
ure, primarily designed to help
Vet students fend off the ex-
travagant costs of~living, has an
added feature in that it will al-

 low an additional $15 for vets

supporting more than one depen-
dent.

ROTC Names
Top Cadets

Nine advanced
students have been designated as
“distinguished military students”

by Colonel John I. Hincke, pro-

fessor of military science and
tactics, with " the approval of
Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald.

The nine students, all members
of the artillery unit, /are: William

F. Hurd, Donald H. Jones, Wil-_

liam TO. Keeling, Jr., Edward J.
Lamb, John ‘M. Mccue, James J.
Scannell, Jr., Harry R. Snyder,
James F. Schaughency, and Jo-
seph L. Walker, Jr.

A distinguished military stu-
dent is one who has completed
one year
stands out in all his academic as
well as his military work, and
possesses outstanding character
and aptitude for military service.

Students who retain this des-
ignation until graduation are cit-
ed as distinguished military grad-
uates, and are eligible for direct
commission into the Regular
Army. V

Cadets Keeling, Lamb, McCue,
Scannell, and Schaughency are
also members of Scabbard and
Blade, national honorary mili-
tary society.

Research simpliﬁes print making
with development of “Varigam” Paper

Chemists and physicists make
important contributions

Photographic ﬁlm that has been over-
exposed or overdeveloped usually means
a “hard” or"‘contrasty” negative-too
’much silver is deposited on the high-
lights in comparison with that. in the
shadows. The opposite effect, a “soft”
or "thin" negative, results from under-
exposure or underdevelopment. At one
time photographers had to stock four or
ﬁve grades of enlarging paper to correct
for these conditions and get the right

degree of ‘contrast.

To eliminate this expensive, unwieldy
situation, scientists developed “Vari-

gam” variable contrast

paper. With " Varigam,” the whole
procedure of getting different degrees
of contrast is reversed. Instead of using
several grades of paper, the photog-
rapher uses only one. He gets variation
in contrast by use of ﬁlters that control
the wave lengths of light reaching the
paper, thereby getting ﬁner degrees of '“
contrast than are otherwise possible.
The action of “Vari.gam” depends
on the ability of certain dyes to extend
the sensitivity of silver halide emulsions
beyond the blue and blue-green regions.
This eﬁect was well known to scientists.
But “Varigam" has an added feature
—it gives high contrast in the blue por-

On Trading

Dr. Asher Isaacs, professor of
economics in the School of Busi-
ness Administration is the auth-
or of a new and up-to-date book
—“International Trade.”

Providing a complete analysis’

of international trade, the tariff,
and commercial policies in all
their various aspects,‘ the book
has been written with a new ap-
proach, not only to portray the
principles and policies of the sub-
ject, but also to orient the sub-
ject in terms of history, geogra-
phy, politics, international law,
human relations and economics.

The book is divided into ﬁve
parts. Part one deals with the na-
ture of trade policies in general.
Part two is a study of the tariff
in the United States from the
earliest beginnings of the nation
up to the present time. It includes
the problems of tariff-making, the
work of the Tariff Commission,
and a discussion of protectionist,
revenue, and free-trade view-
points. The third part studies the
tariff and closely related poli-
cies in Europe and Asia and the
fourth part covers the same top-
ics with reference to the prob-
lems and policies of international
trade growing out of geographic
conditions and sovereignty.

The ﬁrst job was one for the physical
chemists. Silver halide emulsions, nor-
mally sensitive to blue light, had to be
made to give maximum contrast when
exposed to light in this region.

It was known that certain dyes would
extend the sensitivity of the emulsion
over as far as the infra-red. But they
were not practical for photographic pa-
per, being affected by the red safety
light need i the darkroom. Research by
chemists s owed that certain dyes such
as 1:1’-diethylthiopseudocyanine iodide
extended the light sensitivity only to
the green region. And, most important,
they produced low contrast when used
in lower-than-normal concentrations.
When such a dye was combined with
high-contrast silver halide emulsion,
the result was an emulsion that gave
high-contrast prints when exposed to
blue light, and low-contrast prints when
exposed to green light.

Physicists made this contrast control a
reality by preparing sharp-cutting ﬁl-

‘All My Sons’ Cast

Goes Into

Rehearsal,

Pitt Players took to the boards this week as rehearsals for next
month’s production of the Broadway dramatic success, “All My
Sons,” got under way. Castingihas been completed by Director Har-
vey Pope and will be released in the News Friday.

Like last spring’s offering, “Joan of Lorraine,” the forthcoming
play is straight dramatic, though the contemporary setting and sub-
ject combine with the story’s tense drama to make a play more ap-

pealing to the average person than:

“Joan.”

Author Arthur Miller w a s
praised by top Broadway critics
for his expert weaving and grad-
ual untangling of the plot which
traces the events of one bitter
day in the lives of the Keller fam-
ily and their friends. Miller’s
story points up the moral that not
only can no person escape the re-
actions of his own misdeeds, but
that his actions involve countelss
others as well.

The plot and its climax boil
down to show Joe Keller, a small
industrialist who has let his friend
and former partner take the blame
for defective airplane parts that
cost the lives of over a score of
American airmen during the war,
although Keller is actually respon-
sible. One of his own sons is
missing and undoubtedly dead,
while the other has returned in-
tending to marry his dead "broth-
er's ﬁancee, the daughter of Kel-
ler’s imprisoned partner.

Both his son and his wife se-

cretly realize Joe’s guilt, but it is
not until the ﬁnal act that the
facts come to light, making a cli-
max of dramatic impact after‘ a
steady build—up of pulse-pounding
suspense that leaves audiences as
limp as the ﬁnal curtain.

With such a play, Players hope

this year to draw Pittites to Fos- '

ter Hall in larger numbers than in
previous years.

Use of the still in industry is expected to yield products of greater
purity than can be obtained by present methods. In working with
high molecular weight substances used in modern plastics and drugs,

high vacuum distillation is almoste

essential for puriﬁcation.

Eight Year Standard

Benjamin Franklin Grady’s Panther swimming team is on the
threshold of being the ﬁrst unbeaten varsity athletic team at the Uni-

versity in eight years.

Tomorrow night, the Pitts are top-heavy favorites in the con-
cluding dual meet with Davis-Elkins at the YMHA tank at 8:15.

The West Virginians, sponsoring¢

to American University,‘ 57-18, in
their inaugural. ‘

Not since Carl Olson’s track
team copped every dual meet in
1940 has a University of Pitts-
burgh varsity weathered every
event on the schedule. It was the
fourth successive year on an unde-
feated skein started in 1937.

The last perfect record swim-
ming team was the 1934 edition.
which copped four meets. Car-
negie Tech bowed, 49-23, mighty
Ohio State succumbed, 42-28,
Delaware dropped, 48-23, and
Franklin & Marshall, then a pow-
er, was defeated, 44-27.

Pat Corr was the coach. Pres-
ent ‘mentor Grady did not join the
University staff until 1940.

In ﬁve meets to date, the cur-
rent natators have drowned Al-
legheny, .45-21, submerged. Fenn,
44-31, inundated Slippery Rock
and Edinboro, each by the score
of 59-16, and ﬂooded Penn State,
53-22.

The most recent undefeated
football team was the 1937 eleven,
but one tie marred the season.

er, 31-30. Then they deadlocked
the count on Dan Gallagher’s con-

Everybody left the Stadium Pavilion Friday night feeling
satisﬁed. True, West Virginia won, 70-59. But long after the
score is forgotten, 2800 fans will remember the contest as the
best display of basketball skill seen here in two years.

Although befuddled on defense by Pitt’s slick passing at-
tack, Lee Patton’s tall Mountaineers banged in 29 ﬁeld goals
in 68 attempts (.426) and missed only six free throws out of
eighteen to register seventy. points.

Dr. H. C. Carlson ’s “best littleteam in America” was just
thatas they connected 22 times from the ﬁeld in 48/triesfor

Freshman ‘Trip

Educators

ln Preliminary Tilt. 45-32

By Donald Giﬁin
Six football players tangled with a squad of basketballers Friday
night and the cagers proved the better at their own sport.
Pitt’s basketball Freshmen trimmed the Educators, a team of
gridders who are considered one of the top intramural ﬁves, 45-32,

in a repeat preliminary performance an hour before the Pitt-West ‘
Virginia thriller. 9

In the early contest prior to the
Allegheny game two weeks ago
these same quintets battled to a
34-34 tie. They were naturally re-
matched.

At halftime Friday the two
clubs seemed to be trying to run
off a carbon copy of their other
encounter, for the score stood 17-
all, the result of their first meet-
ing cut in half.

The Frosh apparently wanted
something better than another
deadlock, though. They destroyed
the pattern in the opening min-
utes of the third quarter when
they moved ahead to stay. Cliff
Sinewe’s layup and Bob Everett’s
set shot did the disrupting.

Until then the Educators had
monopnlized the play, mainly
through the work of halfback-
forward Carl DePasqua and his.
six points. I

Fans. who arrived early to nab
the few choice Pavilion seats, saw
Tay Malarkey’s proteges display a
bit of ‘set-shot artistry. The Frosh
registered 9 of 17 ﬁelders the stop-
and-shoot way.

Mike Belich, shortest man on
the ﬂoor, took scoring honors with
15 points. Teammate Bob'Everett

hooped 11, while Lindy Lauro,

usually a fullback, was ‘spearhead-
ing the Educator assault with nine
markers, mostly from outside.

switching to a dribble offense.

Great High School Record to Pitt

By Myron Kopelihan _

Getting Art Malmberg to talk
about himself is like wringing out
a dry bathing suit.

Malmberg, a scoring sensation
from East iWashington High and
now a member of Tay Malarkey’s
freshman team, has plenty to talk
about but takes the view that he
-doesn’t want to be out on a limb
“if ,I shouldn’t make good her
at Pitt.” - *

Such a circumstance is hard
to foresee when you consider his
high school ‘accomplishments. Art
lays claim to the WPIAL scoring
record, having scored -1650 points
in four years of ‘play, an average
of morethan 400 per season.

Set Section 21 Record

In his junior year he racked up
496 markers to set a new record
for Section 21. Together with
teammate Dick Palmer, who now
is at Duquesne, he led the East
Washington Ghosts to the section
title four straight years.

, That they never survived a
playoff is Art’s chief regret.

Main weapon in Malmberg’s
wholesale A destruction of high
school records was an overhead
set shot which he dropped in from

the pivot spot.

“But I can't shoot as much from
he pivot anymore,” Art "explains,
‘because we don’t‘ use a pivot

an in the figure eight system. "

like it a lot.” _

lieives Malmberg will be a great
scoring threat.

“At first Art was a little slow
in picking up the system,’_’ said
Tay, “but now he’s caught on
and is coming along just ﬁne. And
he certainly knows how to sink
them with that overhead shot.”
, Six feet three inches tall and
built like a popsicle stick, be-
spectacled Art is a studious-look-
ing individual. He plans to be a
dentist but looks too timid to pull
a tooth.

Many a fan in Washington, how-
ever, will testify that Art is a
mean man with a basketball.

This is Malmberg’s eighth year
of participation on his school bas-
ketball team, which should add
some sort of record to his already
extensive collection. He's been
wearing school colors since sixth
grade. _

Next season Malmberg becomes
a full-ﬂedged ice cream eater for
Dr. H. C. Carlson. So Sammy Da-
vid is liable to have competition

in the scoring column. ~

in an address before members of

Mr. Rich predicted that present

pers can afford lull-time photog-

plained.

With the present demand for
pictures in the papers, it is a good
idea for all reporters to carry

them, he added.
