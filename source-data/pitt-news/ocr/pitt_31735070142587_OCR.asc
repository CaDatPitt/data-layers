Campusfood.com is an acces-
sible way for students to scan the
menus of local eateries without
leaving their computers. Yet what
exactly is Campusfood.com, and
how does it work?

“Campusfood.com is a virtual
food court,” Rob Saunders, a Cam-
pusfood.com employee, said.

The site is an online marketing
system for restaurants that allows
the customer to navigate easily
through local menus, he said. More

than 3,500 students on Pitt’s main ’

campus order from Campusfood.
com every month.

“I use it because it’s more con-
venient and easier than calling.
Especially with the crime rate ris-
ing in Oakland, I feel safer ordering
it at home on the computer rather
than walking,” Nicole Ciofﬁ, a Pitt
junior, said.

While it’s convenient, Campus-

case, Campusfood.com isn’t re-
sponsible._

Cioffi explained that after
she contacted the site about her
missing order, they sent her an
e-mail explaining that they aren’t
responsible for problems on the
restaurant’s end.

Chelsea Meenan, a Pitt junior,
claimed the inconsistencies in the
service dissuade her from using
the website entirely.

“I would rather call because it’s
faster, and I like my food spicy,
which calls for special instruc-
tions,” Meenan said. “I don’t
think the ‘special instruction’ box
is ever communicated correctly
on Campusfood.com. My food is
never spicy enough.

“Although, from a business per-
spective, I think Campusfood.com

is a good idea because it serves as a ’

central location for menus, which
ultimately branches out to a wider
customer base,” Meenan said.

Pitt widely recognized as one of
the country’s leading producers

Nigerian officials train at   Pitt

Marissa Meredyth
For The Pitt News

Nigerian oﬁicials have spent the past four days
in Pittsburgh.

They went shopping at the Monroeville Mall.
They visited the Carnegie Museum ofNat11ral
History.

And they took classes at Pitt. Sort of.

Twenty top officials from Nigeria’s customs
agencybegan aﬁve-dayleadership-trainingsemi—
narhosted by Pitt’sJohnson Institute forRespon—
sible Leadership on Monday.

The officials wanted to learn how to improve
accounmbilityintheirbusinesses andbetter oper-
ate ina global arena, KevinKearns, director of the
Johnson Institute, said.

InNigeria, customs ofﬁcialsare responsiblefor i

instituting safeguards against fraud, corruption
and abuse ofofﬁce, among other things.

BubaMisawa, aprofessor ofAﬁicana studies,
said government corruptionandmismanagement
of oil proﬁts has crippled Nigeria.

As the leading oil producer in Africa, Nigeria
has the potentialto generate massive economic
development ﬁ'orn high oil prices on the world
market, Misawa said. '

Yet more than halfof the count1y’s popula-
tion of about 80 million people live in poverty,
their livelihoods destroyed by the brunt feelings
of deprivation, he said.

He addedthat many Nigerian communities
and people aren’t seeingmoneyfromthe govem-
ment’s oil supplies because corruption occurs on
the local and state levels of government. '

Rebel groups challenge the governments’ 
agementofthe conditions, eachwithverydifferent
motives, Misawa said. ‘ "T;

A Criminal gangs take advantage of the disor-
ganized state of the region to commit oil theft,
which undermines the government and furthers
the misallocation of wealth, while political rebels
rigelections for personal gains, said Misawa.

Kearns said Nigerian leaders need to foster a

climate of change if theywantto help overcome the

problems of ethics accountability and oil theft.
InWednesday’s session, the leaders discussed

ways to toughen business restrictions, whichwill

' hopeﬁilly prevent corporate scandals like those

that occurred inthe U.S.

Kearns said that thoughtteachingthe leaders
was different than teaching Pitt students, hewas
pleased to workvvith them.

“The come here very experienced, often hav-
ing managed alot of people and controlling large
budgets,” he said. “They have strong beliefs and
are opinionated, with their own ideas about the
appropriate ways of dealingwith issues, drawing
from experience.” '

The programbroughtinprominentleaders in
to speak, including Ernesto Butcher: As the chief
operating ofﬁcer of the Port Authority of New
York and Newjersey at the time of the Sept. .11
terrorist attacks, Butcherhas experience in 
management.

This was the fourth time Nigerian officials at-

tended tiainingat thejohnson Institute.
’ Kearns credited aforrner GSPIA graduate and
Nigerian, Deji Olaore, with putting him in touch
with colleagues in Nigeria to get the program
started. '

Fromthere, thejohnson Institntehasworked
with Akin Iroko, CEO of 'I‘VL Consulting, a ﬁrm

’ specializing in corporate governance and ethical

issues inNigeria. Italso holds workshops to update
leadership skills of professionals and works with
theAssociationofNationalAccot1ntantsofNigeria

and gender stereotypes.

One in four girls and one in six boys are sur-
vivors of sexual abuse, Miller said, but very few
violators are convicted. In order to change this,
he encouraged women to engage men and “get

' them involved in the movemen ”

He advised st11dents to evaluate their own
lives, relationships and interests and to determine
whether they were making healthy choices — or
“toxic” ones. He insisted that people need to un-
derstand why sexual abuse_is not acceptable and
change their behavior accordingly. Inorder to do
this, Miller suggested that those already involved
with the movement “draw people in gradually 
[and] approach the issue so people want to talk
about it.” ’

The CWO rally wasanetfortto dojustthat

Robin Lane, CWO political action chair and a

Pitt junior, said the march was not catering to an
audience of one gender, but to men and women
alike. Lane said thatthe group purposely marched
in places where women would be afraid to walk
at night.

‘To women, it’s encouragement. To men, it’s
saying, "I'hat’s not ok,”’ Lane said.

Student speakerjulie Good, a junior transfer
studentmajoringinmedia and professional com-
munications, encouraged survivors of rape and
sexual assault to seek help.

“Silence,” Good said, “encourages the tormen-
tor.”

Pitt Counseling Center counselor Kym]ordan-
Simmonsstressedthatthe centerotfers free, conﬁ-
dential servicesweeklyand biweeklyto allstudents
because “Even one violation, episode, or incident
is too much.”

Beloved children’ 3 book adaptation a great ‘ing’

Merritt Wuchina
For The Pitt News

“Where the Wild 'I‘hings Are”
Starring: Max Records, Catherine
Keener,]ames Gandolﬁni

Director: Spikejonze

Studio: Warner Bros.

Grade: B+

Try as we might, it is impossible to
make our own perfect kingdom in an
imperfect world.

“Where the Wild Things Are,” di-
rected by Spike Jonze, portrays this
lesson in 101 minutes — aremarkable
featconsideringthatits source material
is a 10-sentence picture book.

Jonze, known for quirky features
such as “Beingjohn Malkovich,” em-
ploys the same brand of creativity in
WTWTA.

Likewise, screenwriter David Eg-
gers brings poignant dialogue to the
script as he does in his acclaimed
memoir, “A Heartbreaking Work of a
Staggering Genius.”

The storyistoldthroughthe eyes of
rambunctious and misunderstood Max
(Max Records), who loves his single
mom (Catherine Keener) even though

she usually neglects him while strug-
gling to balance her work, boyfriend
and children.

A‘ One night, Max starts acting up
while his mom has her boyfriend over,
so she sends himtohisroorn. Maxbites
herandrunsaway, then stumbles upon
a boat in the woods, and using it, he
sails offto anislandﬁ1llof1m' ag1nary'
creatures called the wild things.

At first, the world seems exciting.
Max makes new friends, including a
stripedbeastnamed Carol (James Gan-
dolﬁni) and the friendly, long-haired
KW (Lauren Ambrose).

Somearenotso nice,while several
are just plain silly.

Eventually, Maxsees howthisworld
is not much diiferent from his own.

MaxhasanepiphanywhenKWtells
him that even among the wild things,
“it’s hardto beafamily”..

As expected, the movie heads in
the direction of a kid-friendly and
message—appropriate ending.

However, the themes in W'I'W'I‘A
are quite dark for a movie marketed
toward children. Although playful
montages often diffuse the intensely
emotional scenes, sometimes Jonze
imbeds even lighthearted scenes with
traces of spiteﬁil dialogue.

The wild things try to be caring
creatures, but nothing ever feels quite
right in their world. And Max begins
to misshishome life.‘ ' e

Along with the powerful universal
themes, the setting, cinematography
and special effects are stunningly
organic. Even though Max’s world is
make-believe, the scenery looks like
it came out of your backyard — just
bigger and better.

The camera captures the natural
landscapes’ earthy shades of brown,
Max’s fortress looks like a giant bird’s

nestandthebeachfeels likeali_fe—sized' T

tion, mechanical puppets and -

technology, the wild things come to
life. Although they are about six times
Max’s size, the furry and horned crea-
tures come across as something more
likelytowalkoutofthewoodsthansay,
a deer or a raccoon.

The world of the wild things takes
audiences on a whimsical journey
through the nostalgic joys and hard-
ships of growing up.

After traveling with Max, it’s only
natural to want to spend some time
taming our own wild things. Now if
only we could getahold of thatboat 

Max and one of the wild things hug it out —— hipsters everywhere swoon. -

Layton: Don’t believe all the
hype surrounding ‘hype’

You are about to see a sentence that
could potentially change the way you
look at every other sentence for the
rest of your life. It is unique and elu-'
sive, and its creation has been plagued
with problems and controversy. Early
reviews of the sentence are touting
it as masterful, and the sentence has
high expectations to become radically
popular (or even makealotof money).
Are you ready? Here goes 

Hype.

Yes, that’s the sentence. Are you a
little letdown? I’m not surprised —you
were potentially pumped up to read a
revelatory sentence based on the ex-

, citement I instilled in you before you

actually read it.
Welcome to the dastardly decep-

tive phenomenon known as hype.

Hype, by deﬁnition, is the extrav-
agant and intensive promotion of a
product, but as it is more commonly
recognized today, it’s when a product
experiences anutterlyformulaic series
of spikes and falls in public interest.

The mass media steers anddirects
the ﬂow, but itisthe potential consum-
ers of the product that do the dirty
work — mostly through the tangled
web of social networking sites that
seemingly have no commercial pur-
pose otherthan generating awareness
as quickly as possible.

One recent example of a ﬁlm that
has ridden the hype wave with outra-
geous success is“Paranormal Activity,”
the latestlittle-indie-horror—that—could
in the same vein as “The Blair Witch
Project.” The movie’s plot (and quality)
is irrelevant — what matters here is

and also takes out a percentage of
each order the restaurant makes.
Muhammad Issa, the owner of
Leena’s, which, according to a sign
outside the restaurant, is home of
the “World’s Greatest Gyro,” said that
Campusfood.com is not an ideal ser-

takes too longto get delivered through
Campusfood.com. I’d rather people
come here, and see the man behind

In some students’ experiences,
ordering through Campusfood.com
seems to take longerthan if they had
simply placed a phone order.

“I don’t knowwhy it takes so long

whenlorderfrom Campusfood.com,”
Meenan said.

Saunders said that the restaurant
can make its own deliveries, but if
they don’t, Campusfood.com offers
a pick—up service. '

Some restaurants, however,
choose not to publicize through or
use Campusfood.com at all.

“We don’t have the capacity to
handle it,” Rhonda Abraham, the
owner of Antoon’s Pizza, said. The
restaurant is open until 3 am. from
Thursday through Saturday,‘ but if
you call before that and don’t get
through, it’s not because Antoon’s
is closed .— it’s because the phone is
off the hook.

“Friday and Saturday nights are
too crazy here. Sometimes we need
to take the phone off the hook,” Abra-
ham said.

Abraham said thatanlntemet or-
dering site would be too much — “Its

It has been a top trending topic on Twitter
for over a week now, and though I have heard
mixed reviews from people who actually sawthe
ﬁlm(again, much like the response “Blairwitc ”
received), the ﬁlm is only poised to grow, expand
and make even more money.

— The hype machine isn’t necessarily a bad
thing, as long as consumers can keep their ex-
pectations in check with reality. Regardless of
how much we pump something up in our minds,
the chances of the product being revolutionary

. (or even meeting our expectations) are depress-

ingly middling.

Giving into excessive hype doesn’t‘make the
consumer stupid, justalittle overzealous. “Where
the Wild Things Are” has been one of the most

hyped—up movies in recent memory, and while it

went through the backlash process (an entirely _

different concept worthy of its own column)
months ago for supposedly being “too scary for
kids,” it is getting rave advance reviews.

Once this occurs, however, the question is
raised ofhype’s impactonaconsumer’s judgment.
Do wethink somethingis good, or perhaps alot

itwas hyped up? I wish I could say yes, but it’s not
always so clear.

“Wannstedt still looking for first winagainst Rutgers

Greg Trietley ‘

Staff Writer

Last season, the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights knocked off then-No. 17
Pitt, racking up almost 400 yards
through the air in a 54-34 romp at
Heinz Field.

One year later, Rutgers (4-1, 0-1 Big
East) will try to repeat the feat when it
meets the Panthers (5-1, 2-0 Big East)
Friday night in Piscataway.

The Scarlet Knights have always
beenathorninDave Wannstedt’s side.
Rutgers rides a four-game winning

5 "‘streak against Pitt into this week’s

game.

“Ijustthinkthat they’ve made few-
er mistakes than we have,” Wannst-
edt said of Rutgers’ play against Pitt.
“They’ve just played better than we
have. That’s been the bottom line.”

Although the running game saved
Pitt last week against Connecﬁcut,
repeating the ground game success
might prove difficult against the Scar-
let Knights. Rutgers leads the Big East
in rushing defense, limiting its opposi-

tion to 2.3 yards per run.

“They move constantly with their
linebackers,” Wannstedt said. “It forc-
es you to handle it physically, but it
really tests you mentally too. You’ve
got to be sharp.”

Dion Lewis and Ray Graham han-
dled the mental challenge of a 15-point
deﬁcit lastweek. Lewis nowtrails the

nation’s leading rusher, Stanford’s I

Toby Gerhart, by eight yards.
Meanwhile, this weekend marks
a bit of a homecoming for Graham.
Rutgers Stadium sits 25 miles away
from his hometown ofElizabeth, N.J.
Wannstedt said 11 current Panthers
hail from NewJersey or New York.
While Lewis and Graham both
weigh in at less than 200 pounds, the
Scarlet Knights bringpowerfrom the
backﬁeld. Juniors Joe Martinek and
Jourdan Brooks each see a good deal of
carries, and neither goes down easy.
“[Brooks] is 230 [pounds] and
[Martinek] is 215 [pounds] ,” Wannst-
edt said. “You have to tackle them.
They’ve got the ability to run away
fromyou,buttheycanalso overpower

you.”

, Accordingto Wannstedt, Martinek
and Brooks also aided the develop-
ment of true freshman quarterback
Tom Savage.

“It’s a matter of giving [Savage]
conﬁdence,” Wannstedt said. “They
do a nice job of protecting him from
the standpoint of they’ve got ‘a very
good running game.”

In addition, Wannstedt said that
Rutgers likes “throwing in a little bit
ofwildcat,” using senior quarterback
Jabu Lovelace.

For Pitt, quarterback Bill Stull
holds a 163.5 passer rating after last
week’s 24-21 comeback win over the
Huskies, placing him fourth in the
nation. '

Wide receiver Jonathan Baldwin
caught eightpasses for 104yards and
atouchdown against Connecticut. As a
result, Wannstedt said thatthe Scarlet
Knights‘ might double-team him this
week.

“We’re not hung up on the idea
that we have to get the ball to Jona-
than,” he said. “If people are going

to double cover him or do certain

Rutgers enters tonight’s game

Southern last Saturday. With the vic-
tory, the Scarlet Knights have scored
144 points in four consecutive wins

shoulder against Connecticut. Safety
Elijah Fields, whp missed last week
with an ankle injury, is day-to-day.

Although- the Panthers escaped
last week with a win, Wannstedt still
wants the full 60-minute effort that
was absent from both the Louisville
and Connecticut games.

“What we went through Saturday

is unusual,” he said. “I asked [the play- _

national, Maryland and the Tigers. perience. I wanted to make sure that
Pitt will likely play without cor- they didn’ttake itfor granted orthink

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s basket-
ball teams start practice Friday, and
‘both must work to ﬁll the holes left
by departed starters.

The men’s team lost four starters
ﬁ'om last year’s Elite Eight squad. The
Panthers have a young roster, with
four true freshmen and two redshirt
freshmen on the team.

Despite the youth, coach Jamie.

Dixon holds high expectations for
the season.

“On paper, I know what it looks
like,” Dixon said, “We’re going to be
picked lower, but we’ve always been
picked lower and ﬁnished higher.
We’ve always had guys elevating their
games and surprising people. I an-
ticipate that happening again.”

The team’s two seniors,Jermaine
Dixon and Chase Adams, have one
year of experience between them.
Dixon, who averaged 8.4 points for
the team last season, is out until No-
vember because of foot surgery.

Jamie Dixon said Jermaine has

continued to be a leader for the
squad, adding that sometimes it
helps players to see the game from
the sideline.

Adams transferred from Cente-
nary College in Louisiana to Pitt this
year, but he is eligible to play because
Centenary dropped from NCAA Divi-
sion I competition to Division III.

Gilbert Brown, a junior and one
of the team’s more experienced play-
ers, has been suspended from the
team for the fall semester because
of academic reasons.

One of the intriguing storylines
going into the season is who is going
to take over for departed star point
guard Levance Fields. The Panthers
have three point guards on their
roster:.Adams, Ashton Gibbs and
Travon Woodall.

“We recruited Ashton and Travon
for this situation right here,” Dixon
said. “We took two very good point
guards in the same class and two guys
that can play together, too.”

' Jamie Dixon said he likes the
versatility and quickness the guards
bring to the ﬂoor, saying that ﬂexibil-
ity is something the team will work

[With practice starting today, both Panthers areready to rebuild 

on in practice and is a tool he has
utilized over the years.

Junior guard Brad Wanamaker is
an experienced player the Panthers
will look to for leadership. He was on

the ﬂoor in every game last season, .

averaging 5.8 points. 3
“I want to be a playmaker while
still getting shots up,” Wanamaker
said. “I want to be more vocal. Our
expectations are still high. The
didn’t get lower.” 8
Most ofthe Panthers’ experience
is on the perimeter. Dixon said the
recruited three big men forthisyear’s
freshman class because he knew
there was going to space for them.
Among those frontcourt recruits is
McDonalds All-American Dante Tay-
lor. Talib Zarma andJ.J. Richardson
round out the big men recruits.
“Some freshman is going to play a
lot of minutes this year on the front-
line,” Dixon said. “This will be the
best four guys We’ve ever brought
in as a class.” 7°
The women’s team must replace
four-year starters Shavonte Zellous
and Xenia Stewart, but like Dixon,

tcoach Agnus Berenato is conﬁdent ,

Syracuse stumbling

After a 2-2 start, the Orange have looked bad in Big East play

its ﬁrst two Big East matchups — a 34-20 loss
to South Florida followed by a shellacking at the
hands of the Mountaineers.

“We’re creating too many mistakes, more so
i1owthatwe’vegot1:en into BigEastplay,” Syracuse

coach DougMarmne saidinateleconference. “We
keep shooting ourselves in the foot, but ‘we also
have to be strong enough mentally to come back

Mountaineers afcergivingthe ball awayjust seven

A _ timesinitsﬁrstfour games.

Seven of those turnovers camefrom passes by
quarterback Greg Paulus.

Eventually, Marrone benched Paulus in favor
of sophomore Ryan Nassib in the second half. It
begs the question —— is the Paulus experiment
over at Syracuse?

There’s still no ofﬁcial word, but there isn’t a‘
whilfof encouraging news, either.

“We’re goingto lookback and seewhat’s going
wrong in our passing game and on third down,”
Marrone said, “We’ll look at the plays were run-
ning to see if they’re not being run enough in
practice.”

Luckily for Syracuse,-they don’t play another
game until Halloween, which should allow some

“We have a great program,” Berenato said.
“It wasn’t about just a team. The kids that are
here, they’re the ones that are going to step
up.” , _ .
Among those players is junior point guard
Jania Sims, who suffered a season—ending in-

" jury in Pitt’s ﬁrst game last year. Sims is one of
.. the best point guards in the country, Be_renato

said, and Sims used last year to improve her

 knowledge of the game and ﬂoor coaching

abilities. . ,

“Iwas surprised thatI could do all the physi-
cal things thatl did before when I came back,”
Sims said. “Now, I’m just a smarter player.”

: Iii Center Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson, a sopho-
- -Iinore, also returns to the team after becoming

the only Big East athlete selected for the USA
Basketball U19 squad.

Despite not being able’ to compete with the
team because of surgery, Wilson said it was a
great experience and that competing with play-
ers at that level boosted her conﬁdence.

Shayla Scott will move from the forward to
the guard position this season, a chance she’s
excited for. She said she wants to step up and
contribute more offensively.

16 appearances the Panthers experienced were
the beginning of a tradition for the women’s
basketball program.

“We don’t want, to have a good team, we
want to have a good program,” Berenato said.
“Anytime you get to back—to—back Sweet 165,
you start to establish a tradition, and that’s
something we haven’t had here.”

  W VU ’s Devine earns offensive player of the week for second straight

Big East < 9

. A’: '.g.~ _
time for the Orange to improve.

Pitt Football Question of the Week:

In six games, Pittfreshman runningbackDion
Lewis has had seven rushing and one receiving
touchdown for a combined 48 points. Lewis is

on pace to break this Pitt freshman’s record of 90

4' points in a_season. Who is this player?

Last weel<’s answer: Thanks to seniors Tina
Oravec and Ashleigh Hogue, who both had the
correct answer of Larry Fitzgerald as Pitt’s all-
time, single-season receivingyards record holder
(2003).

Big East Player of the Week (Offensive):

Noel Devine, West Virginia — Devine gets the

back-to—back award for another stellar perfor-
mance against Syracuse, 103 all—purpose yards
and two scores.

BigEastPlayer of the Week (Defensive):

Robertvaughn, Connect1'cut—Vaughn almost
single—handedly dismantled the Panthers Withhis
play. He picked olftwo passes, returning one fora
touchdown, and had 10 tacldes.

Rankings of Power — Week 4:

1. Cincinnati (Last week: Bye) — This depends ‘

on the huge matchup against South Florida late
last night.

2. South Florida (Last week: Bye) — Likewise _

for the Bulls, they could take the No. 1 spot with

an upset over Cincinnati.

3. Westvirginia (Lastweek: 34—13winat Syra-
cuse) - The Mountaineers keep chugging along,
but they still remain outside the top two teams
because of their lackluster schedule. Their daunt-
ing Big East slate (UConn, at Cincy, at USF, Pitt,_at
Rutgers) is’ creeping ever so closer. M

4. Pitt (Lastweek: 24—21win over Connecticut)
— The Panthers against Louisville are contenders in
the Big East, butthe Panthers against Connecticut
are mediocre. This team is a mystery but should
contend the rest of the way.

5. Connecticut (Last week: 24-21 loss at Pitt)
— The Huskies needed a win against Pitt to vault

Pitt (5-1, 2-0) at Rutgers‘ (4-1, 0-1): The
Scarlet Knights will try to run their 
streak to ﬁve against the Panthers, who don’t

— have anybody on their roster that beat Rutgers.

Louisville (2-3, 0-1) at Connecticut (3-2, 0-1):
Here’s an easy must-win for the Huskies to get
back on track and inthe race for the Big Easttitle.
Marshall (4-2) at West Virginia (4-1, 1-0): The

Mountaineers own intrastate rival Marshall.

in football, as they’re a.-perfect 8-0 against the

A Thundering Herd. But here’s the debate: Who

beats who in star power, West Virginia, with tlie
likes of Billy Mays, or Marshall, with its own
Hollywood ﬁlm and Billy Crystal as an alum?
