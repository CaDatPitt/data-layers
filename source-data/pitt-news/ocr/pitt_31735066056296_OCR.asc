 

Veteran speaks out against gays in the military

By Rebecca Baker
Staff‘ Writer

The issue of gays in the military
exploded as college students listened to
the views of David McMullin, Soldier
and Sailors chairperson of the Board of
Managers and Korean War veteran.

At last night’s College Republicans’

‘meeting in the William Pitt Union, the

CRS were not the only group listening,
also listening were the University
Democrats, BiGALA and CMUout.

McMullin said that the military’s
l’esprz't de corps would be ruined if
homosexuals were admitted into the
military. _

“When you’re in the military you see
all the differences evaporate, except
one — that you’re all men. If you have
homosexuals fighting with other men,
there would be a bre.akdown of the
morale factor,” McMullin said.

He said another problem of having
gays in the armed forces is housing. He
said the way that soldiers live in bar-
racks and on ships are not suited for a
homosexual lifestyle.

“Where would they fit?” he asked.
“Physically, they’re men 

McMullin related his experiences in
the military with the standing room
only audience.

“When you go to basic training,
you’re thrown in with a diverse group
of people that if you had the choice,
you wouldn’t associate with,” he said.
“The people you’re with are from differ-
ent racial backgrounds, different ethnic
backgrounds and [different] economic
backgrounds."

He said that the Army breaks you
down mentally and physically.

“And everyone there from these
diverse backgrounds come together as
a group,” McMullin said. “A spiritual

He said that because of this bond, no
man leaves another man behind in
combat.

“When you’re down in the mud and

bullets are whizzing over your head,
you’re fighting for your life and the
lives of your brothers,” he said. “The

Teens suspected
in two Oa/eloma’
area robberies

By John Temple

Asst. News Editor

Groups of‘teenagers wielding
handguns robbed people in two
separate incidents last week.

On Wednesday, three male
teenagers entered the front door
of a university student rental
apartment and demanded money
from the three student occupants
inside.

One suspect was wearing a ski
mask and brandishing a small cal-
iber, blue revolver. After taking
about $75, the three suspects ﬂed
in an unknown direction on foot.

In another case, which police
believe was unrelated to the first,
two teenage males with a hand-
gun stole a woman’s purse.

At 1():4() p.m., the victim was
getting into her car behind Trees
Hall after Saturday night's Pitt bas-
ketball game, when the suspects
approached, partially displayed
the gun and took her purse.

“We don't think the incidents
were connected because the one
after the game was a crime of
opportunity, but the one in the
apartment was planned,” Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses said.

Moses also said he does not
believe that these smaller-scale
robberies were connected to a
recent city-wide string of conve-
nience store stickups attributed to
a Homewood gang.

Infection kills second

Student Government Board member Ted
Schroeder presented a recommendation on the
proposed essence of an undergraduate business
school to fellow board members at last night’s
SGB meeting. The recommendation was also
discussed at last week’s Senate Council meet-
ing.

Faculty’s complaints dealt with the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences’ unanimous decision against
the undergraduate business school and that the
proposal did not go through the Planning and
Budgeting Committee.

SGB is strongly for the business school. The
recommendation reads as follows:

“Understanding the objections of faculty, par-
ticularly the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, to an
undergraduate business school, the Student
Government Board realizes that the creation of
such a school will place at least a temporary
strain on faculty resources, both fiscal and
physical. We also acknowledge that the possi-
bility of short—term detriment to some CAS stu-
dents exists.

However:

1) Whereas the Katz Graduate School of
Business already provides an excellent base for
business education at the University of

2) Whereas the academic needs of students
seeking undergraduate education in business
are not sufficiently provided for under the cur-
rent undergraduate structure, and;

3) Whereas the establishment of an under-
graduate school of business would be of long-
term benefit to all students and the entire uni-
versity community;

The Student Government Board resolves that
the proposal for the creation of the College of
Business Administration should be carried out
as efﬁciently as possible by the Ofﬁces of the
Provost and Chancellor, who have to this point
been diligent in their support of this issue. We
believe such action to be in the greatest general
interest of undergraduate students at the
University of Pittsburgh.”

After hearing the recommendation, SGB
unanimously accepted it.

SGB President Jacob Brody said the SGB
feels that the establishment would be the
“greatest benefit to the students of this universi-
ty and to the prestigious image of the University
of Pittsburgh.”

“It will create a greater position, an entrance
for high school graduates that apply to _the
University of Pittsburgh and can now apply
knowing they'can get a degree in undergradu-
ate years for a business program,” Brody added.

The second baboon-to-
human liver recipient died
apparently due to complica-
tions resulting from an infec-
tion. The source of the infec-
tion was thought to be a leak
in the small intestine, possibly
where the liver was attached.
However, the exact source has
not been determined.

“There are about 10 possible
causes, we don’t have an iden-
tifiable source for the infec-
tion,” University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center Chief of
Transplantation John Fung said.

“Unfortunately, we’ll proba-
bly never be able to find out.
The cause could be related to
age, it could be related to med-
ication, it could be related to
technical issues. Some of those
you are not going to be able to
find out on a microscopic
autopsy,” Fung said.

Further autopsy results will

baboon liver recipient

not be available for at least six
to eight weeks, Fung said.

The patient died Feb. 5, 21
days after transplantation.
According to Fung, there may
be little or no observable
results of some new procedures
that were instituted following
the results of the first baboon
liver transplant. For example,
the infusion of white cells from
the baboon into the recipient,
which was done to acclimatize
the recipient’s body to the for-
eign tissue.

During a liver biopsy con-
ducted on Feb. 3, surgeons dis-
covered a leak in the patient’s
small intestine. A hole in the
stomach or intestine will allow
bacteria to be released, result-
ing in an infection. The
immunosuppression drugs
being administered to the
patient (to prevent rejection of
the baboon liver) makes it hard
to treat infections effectively.

Pitt Law argues
international case

By Victor Wallace
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Law School did not
fare well in the Phillip C.
Jessup Irlternational Moot
Court competition hosted by
Pitt on Saturday and Sunday.

Pitt’s team squared off
against 11 schools from
Washington, D.C., Virginia,
Maryland and Pennsylvania
in the Mid-Atlantic Regional
Competition.

In competing, the teams
had to argue an international
case involving countries dis-
puting over manufacturing
arrangements of a country’s
new government.

“This competition provides
students from a number of
schools in the region Ia
chancel to learn more about
international law,” Dean of
the Law School Mark
Nordenberg said.

George Washington
University beat George
Mason University in the
finals to win the competi-

tion. Both teams were
anchored by women.
“That’s unusual," said

Caroline West, Jessup coor-
dinator for Pitt. “It‘s been
hard for women to break
into it. I hope to see more of
it in the future.”

George Washington now
will proceed to Washington,

D.C., for the nationals. If the
team wins it will ‘compete
internationally, which will
also be held in D.C.

Pitt placed ninth overall in
the event. The team won
three out of four of its oral
arguments, but was stomped
in the memorial, or written,
part of the competition.

“If this was solely oral
we’d have done well,” West
said.

However, Pitt does have
hope for the future since
team members Todd
Shenkin and Mark Epstein
may return to compete next
year.

Individually, Shenkin was
ranked seventh out of 70
people in the oral category.
And Epstein, along with
teammate Rich Matesic, got a
perfect score in one round.

According to student
spokesperson for the event
Steven Miller, the biggest
benefit of the competition
was the exposure it brings to
the. Law School.

“Hosting the competition
was a really big deal for us,”
Miller said. “It brings a lot of
attention to our school. They
are already talking about
bringing more on interna-
tional law to Pitt.”

But for now, it is classes as
usual for the Pitt team and
event coordinators.

plant, the liver seemed to func-
tion well despite the other
problems.

“Prior to the discovery of the
infection, the liver consistency
was normal and functioned, as
evidenced by the production of
bile and normal coagulation
parameters. Even at autopsy
there did not appear to be any
immunological damage to the
liver blood vessels, although
there was terminal damage to
the liver from the infection,”

Fung said.

Pitt’s Institutional Review
Board had previously given
approval for four baboon-to-
human liver transplants to be
performed on patients with
chronic, active hepatitis B.
Continued IRB approval
depends on a case-by—case
analysis.

will not go forward with any
additional human trials until a
full analysis of all the clinical
results becomes available.

sidered unnatural. It doesn’t
cause anger or fear, it causes
disgust.”

According to McMullin, the
media have tried to shift views
from homosexuality from a
mortal sin to a mental illness to
now an acceptable lifestyle.

“The question here is not
‘Gee, can I get into the mili-
tary?’ but to make homosexual
acts legitimate, to make them
acceptable into society,”
McMullin said. “The military is
not designed to be compas-
sionate or sympathetic. It’s
to win the war, to win the
fight.”

When asked about homosex-
uals already in the military,
McMullin said, “Sure, there are
gays in the military. They got in
because they concealed their

’ practices.”

“The way male and female
sexual organs are made, they
harmonize each other,”

McMullin said. “With two males
 I’m sorry.”

CMUout member Scott Safir
quoted from Gays in Uniform,
a book about a study on homo-
sexual practices in the armed
forces. While Safir was speak-
ing many people voiced their
opinions about the issue, but
were then cut off by CR
President Kevin Doherty when
a violent shouting match
ensued.

“He thinks homosexuals can’t
control their sexual urges, and
this study says otherwise,“ Safir
said after the meeting. “its like
[McMullin] wrote his speech
from the book except he
ignored all the evidence."

CR Vice President Eric Lurie
agreed with McMullin’s views
about gays in the military. “In
the past 48 years that this poli-
cy has been in effect,
Americans have emerged from
three wars as the last valid war
power,” he said.

Discriminatory ban

George Orwell, in his classic novel Animal Farm, wrote that all
pigs are equal, but that some pigs are more equal than others.
Today, as military and congressional leaders debate over the
issue of homosexuals in the military, the United States seems des-
tined to fulfill this prophesy.

When young men and women join the armed forces, they do
so because they love their country lzind because they are willing
to die for it. T heyfight for their country, not as blacks, Catholics,
Jews or Chinese, but as Americans. Still, there remain a few citi-
zens unable to enjoy the same inalienable rights of their fellow
Americans — homosexuals. The discrimination against them, tra-
ditionally advocated by the military, is no doubt partly responsi-
ble for the acceptance of anti-hornosexual legislatio‘r‘i in Colorado
as well as other states. '

There has been much concern as to whether or not the accep-
tance of homosexuals in the military will lead to the early retire-
ment of top leaders and other military brass. If this be the case,
then so be it. The issue here is: what’s good for America?

And the answer is to end this policy of discrimination.
Homosexuals have performed every bit as good as their hetero-
sexual counterparts in other NATO countries. Only Britain and
America have this type of policy.

It is difficult to understand why this has turned out to be such
a politically damaging issue. Especially for many republicans.A
basic premise behind the Republican ideology is a smaller role
for government. Most Republican members of the Senate object
the lifting of the ban. The military spends countless dollars and
time on worthless witch hunts. Lifting the ban would enable the
armed forces to get on with important issues and save some
money in the meantime. Now that’s something that should
appeal to those Republicans who oppose it.

Multicultural questions

Today, the buzzword on many college campuses across the
country is “multiculturalism.” The University of Pittsburgh is no dif-
ferent. As racism and crimes against homosexuals are more and
more in the public eye, increased awareness, it is hoped, will help
alleviate the problems and move society toward more‘ tolerant
lines. '

But even with all this talk of multiculturalism on campus, the
temr is still a very difficult one to define. Does it celebrate the dif-
ferent ethnic groups on campus?

As it stands now, multiculturalism strives to increase cultural
awareness on campus by focusing on those groups which have
been historically challenged. Among them are the Black Action
Society, Campus Women’s Organization, BiGALA and deaf or
blind groups. The problem is these groups do not represent "cul-
tures" but rather special interest groups. There are many women in
CWO that represent many cultures.

The quest for either a center or a multicultural display is an hon-
orable one. But the way it looks now, the display windowmay
focus more on political correctness than on substantive meaning.
In its proposal, the Student Government Board failed to identify
what is multicultural and what is not.

Who is going to decide what cultures are accurately represented’
And what criteria will be used? The meaning of culture has been
loosely defined in the proposals issued by the SGB. Failure to
address these issues will seriously gut the true meaning of the pro-
ject.

Cultural understanding is a slow and evolutionary process which
occurs through close interaction and individual choice. A multicul-
tural center is a good idea, but it must be done with the interests
of all groups in mind. Otherwise it shouldn't happen.

Knowing one's roots is important

In reaction to Mr. Michael
Gilberts letter (Pitt News Feb. 18,
1993), I see that Gilbert intuitively
realizes that racism is increasing on
both white and black sides of the
board. However, it seems he places
some blame on the intensified
African-American search for their
ancestry. May I point out that Mr.
Gilbert is well aware of his German
and Italian ancestry, and I detect a
subconscious pride, knowledge-
able of the cultures or not. Few
African Ameriarns can even guess
from which part of Africa they have
descended, let alone the varied
other cultures from which we
come. The great jazz drummer,
native of Pittsburgh, Art Blakely
once said, “You must know your
history, or else the next thing you
know, Duke Ellington is gonna be
white.” Roll over Beethoven. The
fact is, that the nature of the U.S. of
Ahasbeentoerasethehistoryof
those not related to the “main
stream descent of the ‘founding
 That is less so due to the
rise of many voices in this ever-
shn'nking world today.

As for the case at hand, Mr.
Gilbert need not know of his
ancatryifhisgnoupinthefamily
of man controls most of the econo-
my. Asians and East Indians have
been able to do well precisely
because they are aware of their tra-
ditional heritage and partly, also,
due to the existence of a stable
“mother country.”

The African American, out of
frustration, has intuitively realized
the need for a mother country in
order to gain respect in this U.S. of
A, if not self-respect. People in this
country have isolated themselves or
have been isolated, such that it is
not necessary for some to see what
is born of such frustration for very
long. Thus, I suspect there are
many who hold Gilberfs opinion,
which has led me to my pen

Yes itissadthatitdoesnotsuf-
free for one to know merely one's
own nation’s history. But, in this
ever-shrinking world, even
Americans of European descent
scold their recent immigrant par-

us!

If there is an award for stupidity
it should be given to Michael “20
years old without being taught his-
tory" Gilbert. On Feb. 18 in me Pitt
News, Gilbert tried to attack the
African Ras Oscar Eybers for his
excellent article about the new
black revolution which is unfolding
in our worid. He used a number of
petty arguments (if you can call
them that) to try and make Eybers
look foolish for telling the truth.

The first stupid thing he said was
that he “managed to survive in this
world for 20 years without being
taught the history of [his] German
and Italian ancestry.” First of all, I
don’t believe this because I don’t
know one white person who, in
their course in white studies, have
never been taught about people
like Hitler, Eichrnann, Bismarck,
Freud, Mussolini and the Caesars. It
was always taught in my schools,
and if Mr. “white conservative
male” Gilbert has not heard of
these people in  ancestry" by
now, it speaks loudly of how une-
ducated he is.

Secondly, Mr. Unhistory said that
he doesn't “personally see how
tracing African roots is going to
help black Americans succeed in
this country.” A blind man can’t see
anything. Malcolm X was right
when he said, “History is a people’s

memory, and without a memory
man is demoted to the lower ani-
mals.” Gilbert expects Africans to
be reduced to the lower animals
like he is, but we won’t do it
Finally, Eybers is not “doing him-
self a a disservice." He is doing
himself a service. He is doing black
people and all people a service by
telling the truth. As Jesus said, it is
the truth that makes people free. If
Gilbert wants to be a slave to igno-
rance, fine. But he shouldn‘t expect
black people to lower themselves
to his ignorance. And as for my fel-
low black man, Oscar: continue to
concentrate on the truth, not lies. j

Michael Stephen Barge
Black Action 

Pitt News was right on target

I want to commend The Pitt
Neus for the editorial on Tuesday
Feb. 16. Finally, a position that will
allow the News to live up to its
masthead.

I understand it is the job of the
paper to try and be objective, but it
is also the pwpose of the paper to
protect the minority and be the
voice. Since the paper is run by stu-
dents it should slant in favor of the
students.

Your observations about tenure
are right on. Pitt has a reputation
as a graduate/research school -——
now it’s time to develop the under-
graduate school. Pitt needs to take
a holistic approach to the purpose
of education. If the undergraduates
are treated respectfully, equal with
the graduate students, then the
word will spread and quality stu-
dents will come.

Asking the students to take eval-
uations seriously is a good idea and
the kind of propaganda the paper
needs to push. Now take this start
and point out the school’s inconsis-
tencies; make suggestions for the
university to support the under-
graduates — ideas for undergradu-
ate students to focus and rally
behind. The purpose can be a
voice, unifying the students and
raising hell.

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News
Eric Mobley, as he did on this play against UConn Saturday,

had trouble ﬁnding room inside last night at Providence.

By Brian Gallagher
Sports Assistant

PROVIDENCE — A scout
from the Phoenix Suns was
courtside at the Providence
Civic Center last night look-
ing for some talented bas-
ketball players.

After enduring just 2O min-
utes of the Monday night
Big East matchup between
Pitt and Providence, Mr. Big-
time-NBA scout’s verdict was
in on the relative talent
assembled on the pieced-
together 94-foot slab of
hardwood.

“There are no good
ballplayers,” he said, disap-
pointed at his futile attempt
to discover a ray of light.
“This is a terrible basketball
game.”

In a game best described
as anything but an example
of seini-competent NCAA
Division I basketball, the.
Providence Friars survived
yet another Big East battle
of ineptitude, downing the
swooning Pitt Panthers 53-48
before 9,745 ranting Rhode

Island residents and a
national television audience.

Maybe the invitations
should have read, “The
University of Pittsburgh
cordially invites you to the
Charles L. Cost Center on
March 19-21 to serve as
sparring partners for the
players of Akron
University,”

That's the way that play-
ers from Pitt, Youngstown
State and Duquesne must
have felt this past weekend
as players from all four
schools competed in the
Pitt Women’s Tennis
Invitational. The awesome
power of Akron University
could not -be matched in
the tournament, as the Lady
Zips compiled an overall
record of 18-0 (12-O singles,
6-0 doubles), as well as the
Flight A doubles title. A

The only reason that the
Zips didn’t win the remain-
ing four championships
was thatthe final match in
all three singles brackets, as
well as the Flight 13 doubles
bracket, pitted Akron play-

tion, Pitt compiled an 11-12
overall record in the tour-
nament, suffering nine loss-
es at the hands of the Zips.

The Panthers had the
misfortune to draw Akron
in the opening round of
four different brackets, so
they were relegated to the
consolation round for much
of the tournament. Pitt
players competed in the
consolation round of three
brackets, winning the con-
solation finals in Flight A
singles and Flight B dou-
bles.

“I feel that the team
played well, despite having
no outstanding individual
performances," Pitt head
coach George~Dieffenbach
said. “In an individual tour-
nament, there’s less pres-
sure on the players, and_ it
gives us a good chance to

in the Big East) avoided the
tag “loser in a loser‘ game”
by hustling to its fourth
straight victory.

Pitt (15—8, 7-8) continued
its annual February slide,
losing three straight for the
first time this season and
now sharing sixth place in
the Big East with the Friars.

“I was told if you don’t
have anything nice to say,
don’t say anything at all,”
Pitt head coach Paul Evans
said. “I have nothing to say."

Providence led 24-23 at
the half and extended its
lead to as many as eight (50-
42) on a three-pointer by
Tony Turner with 2:53
remaining in regulation.

Pitt closed to within four
on a bucket by Brock
Generalovich with 15 sec-
onds left but ran out of
missed Friar free throws and
ticks on the clock in falling
to Providence for the first
time in six meetings.

With both teams shooting
blanks from the opening
whistle (Pitt shot 30.2 per-
cent from the field.
Providence only 36.4 per-
cent) the battle of the bum-
bling became the battle of
the bulge, rebound for
rebound. That is where
Smith was the key.

Grimacing and cajoling
with equal aplomb, Smith
controlled the glass — and
the ball game —- by snatch-
ing a career-best 18
rebounds to go along with
eight points.

He and center Dickey
Simpkins (11 points) helped
Providence pound Pitt’s one-
two inside punch of Chris
McNeal and Eric Mobley,

rendering the Panthers’
low—post game null
and void for the entire
evening.

McCullough, who led Pitt
with 12 points, said desire
and hustle were the differ-
ences in the ball game.

“I guess they wanted it
more than we did,"
McCullough said. "It doesn't
get any lower than this."

Frustrate.d with the play of
his starters, Evans said after
the game that a change in
the starting lineup was like-
ly. One candidate for the
pine is McNeal.

“I don't know," Evans said
about McNeal’s possible
ouster from the starting line-
up. “He‘s captain. He‘s a
senior  but he's got to do
more than he’s doing.

“He scores 30 against
Illinois and we haven't seen
him since so  we’ll see."

Murphy wins as Pitt men's
track places sixth in Big East

Byjason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

First-year hurdler jay Murphy
must have been saving up for the
time when he was going to make
his presence felt in the Big East.
Murphy won his first race of the
year as he edged University of
Miami’s Aaron Jones in the 55-
meter hurdles for his first title of
his collegiate career at the Big
East Championships this weekend
at SYFZICUSC University.

Murphy led the way for the Pitt
men’s track team, which finished
in sixth place in the Big East
standings. ‘

“The young guys performed

4 very well,” Pitt head coach john

Vasvary said. “For Jay to step in
and win the hurdles in the Big
East Championships, that means
quite a bit.”

Junior Jim Monk and senior
Dave Senay used the Big East
Championships as the time to
turn in their best performances.
Monk threw the shot to a second-
place mark of 53-11 3/4, just miss-
ing the winning throw by 1/2 an
inch. Senay took home a fourth-
place finish on a throw of 51-6
1/2.

“Those were their best throws
ever,” Vasvary said. “It was a great
job by both guys.”

There were other individual
bright spots on a team that fin-
ished in the second half of the
conference.

Sophomore Wes Alexander fol-

lowed Muiphy’s lead in the hur-
dles and finished third with a time

2 of 7.70 seconds.

In the 200 meter, senior Brian
Whitley finished fourth with a
time of 2236, while his teammate,
first-yeai' ninner Cuitis Anderson.
finished sixth with a time of 22.4‘).

junior Tim Flanders needed to
run his best time in the l,()()()
meter to beat out Mike Buonomo
of the I lniversity of Connecticut to
finish third in the Pentathlon.
Flanders slipped into thirdlby
beating Buonoino by just one
point, 3,552 to 3,551.‘

Besides the 1,()()()-meter run,
the Pentathlon consists of the
high jump, shot put, 55-meter
hurdles and long jump.

Vasvary feels that his team’s
standing in the Big East was not a
lack of performance but just a
case of missing some breaks.

Vasvary said they have had
some injuries this season and they
dropped the baton in the distance
medley, which was a potential for
more points. He said they could
have finished higher.

Sophomore hurdler_Iohn Dixon

inissed the meet due to a

sprained ankle. If the Panthers
had Dixon, who is at the same
level as Murphy and Alexander
and could have placed in the dis-
tance medley, they would have
easily finished ahead of fifth place
Miami, which beat Pitt by only
two points and could have been
in contention for fourth place

bach said. “Right now
