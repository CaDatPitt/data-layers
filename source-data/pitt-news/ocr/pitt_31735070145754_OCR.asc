Medical students surrounded Mr.
Smith. His vital signs blinked and
changed on the monitor. He stopped
breathing. ‘

’ The students’ teacher, Dr. Pau1Rog- V

ers, sat nearby, evaluatingtheir perfor-
mance. Smith’s pulse dropped.

“Now what do you want to do?”
Rogers asked his students.

The deﬁbrillator .— one of the stu-
dents applied it to Smith’s chest. She
bit her lip, looking at the monitor. It
didn’twork. The students rejoined their
classmates, who watched them try to
save Smith. He didn’tmakeit. ‘

Fortunatelyforsmith, he isrftareal
person. Smithisamannequin—anex-
pensive, realistic one, anda mostvalu-
able tool for Pitt’s medical students.

“They have mere months before _
H theybecomerealdoctors,andtheyare

scaredto death,” Rogers said ofthestu-
dents, who are all in their fourth year
of study.

The students work in simulation
rooms inPitt’s PeterM.WmterInstitute

forSimulationEducation and Research
on McKee Place. There theyface medi-
calsituations designedtobeas realistic
as possible.

The key is the mannequins, some
ofwhich come witha$45,000 or more
price tag. They talk, bleed, give birth
and die, just like people.

Jamie McKinney, who had intubat-
ed Smith —- the standard mannequin
moniker — pointed at him.

“That thing blinks and sweats,
and its throat closes up,” she said “It’s
freaky.”

Thomas Dongilli, director of op-
erations and administration for the
institute, saidthe realism, although oc-
casionallyunsetﬂing, isbestfordoctors
and patients.

“You don’t want them doing stuff
the ﬁrst time on you,” he said

Besides procedural experience, the
idea is nervousness — getting rid of
it, that is.

Dongilli walked through some of ‘

theinstitute’s 16 simulation rooms, all
of which can be manipulated as nec-

essary.

Schwinn Airdyne bikes and Spinning

U.S. Steel Tower Saturday morning,
along with more than 800 riders,
myriad volunteers and a speaker

system blasting epic ’cuneslike“Sand—

more serious riders wore Spandex
and elastic cycling suits smattered
with team logos and sponsors. Oth-

Health Plan. Teams included at least
12 riders, with each rider completinga
 of one 15-minute heat.
Teams could only change riders
as new heats were armounced --
the process worked like a pit stop in
NASCAR. First, a rider’s teammates
stopped the bike’s wheel, immediately
adjustingtheseat height and toe-cage

g size for the next rider;

Speedometers tracked eachteam’s
distance, whichfor some climbedwell
over 200 miles. In the end, each cat-
egory of racing, such as “corporate
teams,” “men’s team,” “women’s
team” and “spin open,” named a
winner.

Several teams from Pitt partici-
pated in this non-stop stationary ac-
tion, including the Panther Cycling
Club, who raced in the more competi-
tive “spin open” division. A group of
Pitt dental students and a group of
pharmacy students also raced, com-
peting in the less competitive “open”
category. Matthew Appleton, a Pitt
student and captain of the Panther Cy-
cling Club team, explained his squad’s
motivation for joining the event.

“The Race to Any Place is some-
thing of a tradition for the Panther
Cycling Clu ,” Appleton said. “We’ve
participated every year since our club
was founded in 2005, and we’ve man-
aged towinthree of those fouryears.
We’re kind of known when we show
up that we’re here to win. We also hold

the record for the most miles logged A

at the race.”

Appleton said the race represents
one of the friendliest and most excit-
ing competitions of the year, complete
with rivalries and complex strategiz-
ing.

“This is the only event of its kind
that I’ve ever seen,” he said. “There is
always so much energy, especially out

of the ﬁmdraising groups. Of course,

* everyone gets really into the com-

petition, but when you get down to
it everyone is cheering for everyone
else. It’s all about how much money
we can pull in.”

KiraFoley, campaign managerfor
the Leukemia 8: Lymphoma Society,
said the society will use the race pro-
ceeds to combat leukemia, lymphoma,
Hodgkin’s disease and myeloma. Ev-
eryteam makes a $500 ﬂat donation,
with many teams soliciting additional
per-mile pledges from people and
companies in Pittsburgh. ’ ,

Mike Lueck, a Pitt dental student
and captain of the Pit Dental Student
team, is a seven-year veteran of the
race. He ﬁrst participated withhis fra-
ternity at Pitt back in 2003, and this
year he convinceda group of fellow
dental students to grow mustaches
and join him in the race.

“We had our annual dental school
mustache competition going on this
week,” Lueck said. “We decided to join
the race and keep the ‘staches as an
intimidation factor.”

Lueck said his squad has yet to de-
velop any rivalries at the race despite
winning the “open” competition last

year, but he hoped they could “beat

out those pharmacy kids.”

“It’s an amazing thing to be able to
participate in this event,” Lueck said.
“We (the groups combined) raised
over $100,000 inasingle day to help
ﬁght against leukemia and lymphoma
last year, and we are deﬁnitely going
to hit that goal again. Plus, we get to
eat a ton of free food. It seems like
every restaurant in Pittsburgh donates
something. I’n1 lookingforward to the
pierogies and burritos.”

Lueck’s squad again claimed the

“open” division title. It is unclear ‘

whether their mustaches had any-
thing to do with the victory.

cityscape. Street noises play fromspeakers as
students simulate emergency medicine.

There are simulations for dental sedation
emergencies. A “wet room” simulates biohaz-
ard situations, with traurnalimbs that squirtfake
(edible) blood. ‘

Noelle, the obstetrical mannequin, gives
birth to a mannequin baby from her motorized
uterus. In one room, full of mannequin pieces,
Dongilli drew fake blood ﬁom a torso’s subcla-
vian artery.

The simulation rooms are as close to the real
environment as you can get, Dongilli said, and
students get caught in the illusion of reality.

Often, physicianswillcallanendtothe simula-
tion, and the students will insist on continuing,
intent on saving their Smith.

‘‘They’re not ready to give up,” Dongilli said.

The importance of advanced  have-

become more acute since the turn of the century,
when an Institute of Medicine report revealed

0  onmedical errors.

The term “medical errors” generally deﬁnes
those that are preventable. Medical errors can

refer to implementing the wrong procedure or

incorrectly implementing the right one.

The institute’s report said between 45,000
and 98,000 Americans die each year because of
medical errors.

A 2009 report by the Pennsylvania Depart-

‘ mentofHealthfoundthatPennsylvaniahospitals

reported 13,771 health care—associated infections
fromjuly 1 to Dec. 31 of the previous year.

The subclavian artery ﬁ°om which Dongilli.

removed fake blood is located next to the vocal
cords, the carotid artery and the lungs. In the
event a physician needs to ﬁnd that artery, preci-
sion is necessary.

This is why Rogers’ students spend two hours
per day, ﬁve days perweek at the institute.

The class is not mandatory, but Rogers said
most of the students sign up. He said it’s akind of
experience that doesn’t exist in a textbook. q

“I neversawapatientwhohadmultiple choice

‘answers on their chest,” he said.

His students taketurns“nmningthe code”-
or managing a patientfs treatment.

AdamFangranthe code Fridaywhen the stu-
dents cou1dn’t restart Smith’s heart. On the other
side of a one—way mirror, operators watched and

controlled Smith’s Vitals. Someone spoke through
a microphone as Smith’s voice and manipulated
controls that can stop Smith’s heart.

Fang said he sees the positive in the experi-
ence. "

“It’s trialbyerrorhere so we don’t mess up on
the ﬂoorg” he said.

Amanda Stephenson, the studentwho applied

the deﬁbrillator, said it can be scary, especially '

when Rogers tellsthem how he’s seen their simula-
tion situation really happen.

Rogers stopped the sirnulationto reviewwhat
went wrong.

The procedures are all recorded so that later,
even at home, the students can go online and re-
view their procedures and mistakes.

Simulation services coordinator Melissa
Wanker cited one area of the program in need
of improvement: Laerdal Medical, a Norwegian
company, manufactured most of the mannequins,
and theyaremostly pale, blond ands feettall; with
ﬂat stomachs and blue eyes. .

Wanker suggestedcdiiferent kinds of manne-
quins — obese ones, for instance — to achieve a
greater realism.

Still,  saidthewtserprogramis as close
totherealdealasitcanbe.

The program prepares Pitt medical students
invarious disciplines, and it involves doctors from
varied backgrounds who workparttime with the
institute.

The Institute also oﬁ'ers a program for Basic
Life Support training that any member of the
public can take.

Dongilli said the results of their work already

years in a row. The Leapfrog Hospital Survey is a
national public comparison ofhospitals on issues
like infections rates and safety practices.

A Tribune-Review report found a 43 percent
decrease in a kind of intensive care unit blood-
stream infection since 2001.

The realism of the experience is keyto reduc-
ing mistakes in the ﬁeld.

When a student makes a mistake in the in-
stitute, Dongilli said, and Smith goes down, that
studentwill never make the same mistake again

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Learning to speak easy

MCT Campus

With practice and preparedness, overcome fears of-‘ public speaking

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

  
 

Horror movies, forallthe horror and
revulsionlthey provoke, are seldom
criticized for having plots that are
too realistic. Indeed, part of the al-
lure of a horror ﬁlm is the opportu-
nity to have the bejeezus scared out
of you and yet calmly realize that if
you actually see dead people, you
should watch a more recent ﬁlm.

So, what’s the most realistic hor-.
ror ﬁlm of the last decade? I would
nominate “The Great Debaters.”
Why, you say? Well, try saying that
in front of a crowd of people. I dare
you. The Book of Lists published a
list of the 14 most common human
fears, based on a3,00o-person sur-
vey —— chances are, you’ve heard of
this before. Toppingthe list? Speak-
ing before a group, with 41 percent
of respondents listing it. Coming in
tied for number six is death, at only
19 percent. That’s right, if you kill
somebody on his way to a speech,
odds are you did him a favor.

. .,...- .. .c.,._...-....n..—.~.......»- ~

The fear of public speaking is very
real, very keen and very common. In-
deed, I would argue that 59 percent
of people inthat survey were notbe-
ing completely honest. As someone
who was on his high school speech
team for almostfour years and is a
speech coach nowadays, you might
expect me to be completely unafraid
of public address. Yet I still feel a

twinge of anxiety before going in

front of a crowd, and many of my
teammates —— even the most sea-

soned — confess to being slightly ‘
nervous before competition.

What about speakers that seem
really, really conﬁdent, need I say
fearless, on TV or on stage? Take
a closer look: Some of them walk
around a lot, some will keep one

_ hand in their pocket and some will

ﬁddle with the microphone. Others
have a tight grip on the podium. I, for
one, hold my hands on my stomach.

These little ticks are ways of com- '

fortingyourself. The fear hasn’t gone
away; it’s simplybeen mastered. This
is not to say that some people aren’t
less scared than others, but even
those who are comfortable in front

of an audience are still a bitafraid. « '
Where does this fearcome from?

' Most likely itis acombination oftwo

fears: exposure and fear of humilia-
tion. Being “on the spot?’ means that
it is just you facing a seemingly end-
less sea of eyes. This could work on
one of two fears: Claustrophobia,

, where the eyes seem to be closing
' in on you, as they all stare in your .

direction, or agoraphobia, where
the eyes suggest an endless and very
open void. The exposure part might
be a stretch, but fear of humiliation
is not. Show me a person who can’t
wait to be embarrassed because he
likes it so much, and.I’ll show you

a person who needs serious help. *

There is no better place to make a

_ fool of yourself in front of a lot of

people than, well, talking to a lot of

T peopleat the same time. '

V Ironically, the fear of doing

. poorly in front of a crowd leads to

a poor performance in front of a
crowd. What do bad speakers usu-
ally do? They talk inaudibly. They I
talk to their notes or to their Power-
Point. They hem and haw. The inau-
dible speaking and talking into the

the speaker has an audience of just
himself Hemming and hawing is the
verbal equivalent of keeping your
hands in your pockets: It ﬁlls awk-
ward silences when the speaker does
not know what to say next.

So, what can be done to manage
this fear? Clearly, some people are
able to handle it quite well. The ﬁrst
and most important thing to realize
is that you, the speaker, are in con-
trol. Unless you are speaking to the
British or Taiwanese Parliament, the
audience is expected to sit there qui-
etly and listen. They ultimately are
not determining what you are going
to say and by extension what is going

to be said. With great responsibility ‘

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 

To the Editor,

In Giles Howard’s Feb. 24 col-
umn, “Obama plan undemocratic,”
Howard attempts to make the as-

' sertion that “the executive version

of health care expands government
without_consent.” I take issue with
the manipulation of data that’How-
ard includes in his article, and I
seek to make the debate a balanced
one. Howard points out that 40
percent of voters polled support
the president’s health care bill and
49 percent oppose it.

This statistic, featured in News-
week and seemingly accurate, is not
put in context. This percentage is
based upon voters who were asked
whether or not they supported the
President’s bill without being given
any background information. Af-

mind up about you in the ﬁrst 30 or
so seconds of the speech. It actually
helps if the ﬁrst 30 seconds of your
talk are somewhat tangential to what
you are going to say —— something
related to your topic, but not just ﬂat-
out saying “Hi, my name is Bob, and
I’m going to talk about newspapers.”
A better start might include some
anecdote aboutjoseph Pulitzer, for
instance.

Lastly, telling a few jokes can be .

reassuring provided the audience
appreciates them. A laughing audi-
ence isn’t as menacing, and when
you can get the audience to laugh, it
clearly establishes who is in control,
which is reassuring.

After a while, speaking in public
does come more easily, but this natu-
ral human fear never fullyvanishes.

The best thing to. do to reduce a fear
is to practice —— a lot. '

To the Editor,

I am writing regarding the view-
points on faith and science presented
inthe Feb. 16 article “Movie shows Dar-
win’s struggle with theologr.”

Accordingto Gregvoss, aminister
working with the Christian Student
Fellowship, students of faiths still en-
counter signiﬁcant diﬁiculties in sci-
ence classrooms atPitt. This, perhaps,
ﬁts a particular narrow deﬁnition of
faith, and certainly some number of
religious students. Itwould seem, how-
ever, that if students have ideological
issues withthemateiial presented, such
problemsaretheirowntoresolve. Also,
why should professors be expected to
“engageinagive-and-take conversation
thatequallyaddresses creationism”?In
science classrooms where some stu-
dentshave“diﬂiculties,”the professors
are scientists, and the topic is science
(e.g. cosmology orbiological evolution).

Creationism is in no way scientiﬁc.

Darwin did indeed call upon the
next generationtowork onhis theory,
‘and help to conﬁrm or deny it.

Hiswords in“Onthe Origins ofthe
Species,” were, “I lookwith conﬁdence
totheﬁ1ture,toyoungandrisingnat:u—
ralists,whowillbeabletoviewboth
sides ofthe questionwith ’
Darwin was referringto the next gen-
eration, of scientists, and the question
referredto is the mutability of species.
He was conﬁdent that, ﬁom an unbi-
ased view, scientists would be forced
.to acknowledge his theory on descent
with modiﬁcation. He was right.

We do science and scientiﬁc prog-
ress a disservice if we re-inject centu-
ries-old religious ideas into the biology
classroom.

D.C. band brings “brutal expeijience” to Pittsburgh

A necessary part of being a tour-
ing musician is the love of traveling,
especially for ghosts.
The best part about being in the

bandistravelingto new places, Tommy
SiegelsaidinanemailtoThePittNews.
The vocalist and guitarist forjukebox
the Ghost was in Europeat the time,
ﬁnishing up his most recent tour.
The current tour abroad is the sec-
ond intemational tour forjukebox the
Ghost, an established band that has
been praised for entertaining piano-
pop music thatprovides entertainment
and optimism. The band sounds like
a harmonious combination of The
Morning Light and Owl City.
Jukebox the Ghost consists of Ben
Thomewill (vocals and piano) Jesse
Kristin (drums), and Siegel (vocals and

guitar). Whilethis is only their second
tour abroad, the band began touring
extensively in2oo6, usingthe time to
develop their musical skills and estab-
lish a name for themselves.

Before they started touring,Juke- II

box the Ghost went by a different
name. I ‘

“The band ‘oﬁicially’ startedas The
Sunday Mail, and existed under that
name in college for a couple of years,”
Siegel said. “Benandjessehadalready
been playingtogetherfor ayearwhen
I put up an ad in the college music
department in an attempt to start a
band.”

From an ad in the paper, the new
trio set out on the road all new bands
travel. They performed and gained
supportlocallyintheir neighborhood,
speciﬁcally the Washington D.C. area
music scene.

“It was a challenge for a few years,
but once we caught on at our school,

[we were] quick to catch on locally,”
Siegel said. “One of the hardest things
about any local music scene  is the
lack of small, all—ages venues for local
bands to get their start. We couldn’t
evenﬁndawaytoplay outside of cam-

pus events regularly until our senior
year of college, which deﬁnitely im-
peded any attempt at playing for new
people.”

As they searched for venues the
band continued to compose, taking
inspiration from “anywhere and ev-
erywhere,” Siegel said. '

“Ontheﬁrstrecord, allofthe songs
I wrote were about the apocalypse, so
Iwasusingsome oftheweird imagery
inthe Book ofRevelationas my source
of inspiration,” Siegel said. “Currently, I
my inspiration (and Ben’s) comes from
all over the place.”

The eclectic mash of inspirational
sources may contribute to the fact
that the band’s composition process
is“prettynatural.” Butit does makefor
an interesting viewing, he added.

“I thinkanoutside observerwould
be surprised to see how much nitpick—
ing goes on,” Siegel said. “When we
arrangeasong, we’reallpainﬁ1llyaware
of what everyone else in the band is

I playing. We micro-manage every part

of a song and try to make sure the
whole thing is airtight. To an outsider,
I’rn sure it would sound like pointless
bickering, but itsanimportantpartof

the process.”

Jukebox the Ghost has also man-
aged to ﬁnd a strongfan base during
the recovery of the economy, especially
because of the Internet.

“Ifanything, we’ve beneﬁted ﬁ'om
the viral quality of the Internet from
people passing our album aroun ,”
Siegel said.

Behind the scenes, Siegel recently
dealt with vocal nodules — tissue
masses that form on vocal cords and
make speech difﬁcult — but noted
this was the only issue he’s had with
his music career: -

“[I] had to get surgery, which was

. a pretty brutal experience. But if any-

thing, that just made me more dedi-
cated to the band and keeping myself
healthy. I don’t think any of us have

he said.

CONCERT RECAP

McBride
shines
at Pete

( Tonyjovenitti
‘ ’ Staﬂ" Writer

Martina McBride iswidely recognized
as one ofthebestvocalists inmusic, but
Saturday night at the Petersen Events
Center she proved that she can rock,
too.

I Her Shine All Night tour, which
she isheadlining along with country
crooner'I‘race Adkins, invadedthe Pete
with a vast stage that covered nearly
halfof the arena’s ﬂoor.

She jammed through most of her
upbeatsongs inthebeginningofherset,
including“When God Fearingwomen
Getthe Blues” and “Wild Angels.”

McBride’s strongest talent is her
powerful vocals. Her singingcan send
chills down a listener’s spine, hitting
shatteringhigh notes for nearly20 sec-
onds, but a set full of power-ballads
couldleadtoaboringshow.ThanlcEully,
McBride‘—aiter18 years of experience
— knows when to use cover songs to
keep the crowd excited.

I She led a sing-a-longto BillWither’s
soul hit “Lean on Me,” and then sanga
beautifulversion ofthe classic countiy
song of Kris i_<ristoﬁ'erson’s “Help Me
Make Itthrough the Nigh ” ,

Afterfurther showing off her vocals
during the inspiring-song “Anyway,”
McBride rose up ﬁ*om behind the side
ofthe stage sitiingonalarge neon-blue

crowdto asmall stage nearthebackof
the ﬂoorwhile singingthe tear-jerking

I “Concrete Angel.”

“Now you can all say you were
mooned by Martina McBride,” she
said as fans in the back of the arena

rushed down to get temporary front I

rowseats.

Anewtrendincountry musicisfor
the musician to walk directly through
the crowd at a concert — something
thatTaylorS/viftand KeithUrban have
helped perfect. McBride followed that
trend and gave hugs to several women
as she made her way back to the main
stage while singing‘“I‘his One’s Forthe

She nailed one of those chill—in—

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will play its last game of the regular
season when the Panthers host No.
18 St. John’s (23-5, 11-4 Big East) on
Monday night.

Pitt (16-12, 5-10) is coming off a
72-60 victory over Cincinnati on Sat-
urday and the Panthers will look to

‘end the season on a two-game win-

ning streak when they tip off with the
Red Storm at 7 p.m. at the Petersen
Events Center. 8 ~

The game marks the last home
game for the lone senior on Pitt’s
roster, Sophronia Sallard.

Sallard played in 12 games and
started two so far this season. She
averages 6.2 points and 2.9 rebounds
per game for the Panthers.

Aversatile playerwhocanbe used
as a guard or aforward, Sallard trans-

‘ ferred to Pitt after spendingherfresh—

manyear at Kansas, where she played-
in 15 games and averaged 1.8 points in
8.5 minutes per game. '
During her redshirt sophomore
and junior seasons, Sallard played in
65 combined games, including all 33
during herjunioryear. She scoredaca-

Particularly intheir last two wins,
the Panthers limited their turnovers:
an issue they struggled with for the
majority of the season.

Against the Bearcats, Pitt turned
the ball over 11 times and allowed 16
points off the mistakes. On their win
over Seton Hall on Feb. 20, the Pan-
thers turned the ball over14times, al-
lowing on1y13 points off the miscues,
including just ﬁve in the second half.

In contrast, when the Panthers fell
to DePaul, they turned the ball over
20 times and the Blue Demons took
advantage of the mistakes to the tune
of 19 points. V

A constant for Pitt throughoutthe
last three is the play of forward Chel-
sea Cole. Cole scored 10 points and
grabbed a career-high 22 rebounds
against Seton Hall and followed that
game with a 12-point, 18—rebound
performance against DePaul.

Against Cincinnati, Cole led all
scorers with 20 points and grabbeda

game-high 16 rebounds, including six V

offensive boards. Four other Panthers
reached double ﬁgures against the
Bearcats, a statistic that head coach
Agnus Berenato pointed to through-
out the season as the reason for her
team’s success.

Brittaney Thomasandjania Sims
each scoredlspoints, while Taneisha
Harrison addedlo points. Shaylascott
was abasket away from double digits,
scoring eightpoints forthe Panthers.
She also grabbed 10 rebounds and
dished out six assists.

Pitt tallied 18 total assists in the
game, which left them one short
of their game-high total in Big East
play-

The Panthers will look to carry

they take on St. John’s.

The Red Storm, who are having

Top pick in the NBA draft is demoted, second round pick Blair shouis up doubters

This past Thursday the Memphis
Grizzlies announced they were de-
moting former Connecticut star

“and No. 2 overall pick Hasheem

League. ‘

Thabeet averaged a whopping
2.5 points in 50 NBA games with
the Grizzlies and used his outra-
geously lanky 7-foot-3 frame to
pull down almost 3 rebounds per
contest. V

Meanwhile, Dejuan Blair scored
22 points and 23 rebounds in the
NBA, All-Star Weekend Rookie

Challenge seven months after he
lasted until the second round of
the draft.

To be fair, Thabeet had a re-

. spectable eight points and two re-

bounds in his Dakota Wizards de-
but. The Wizards beat the mighty
BayHawks of Erie, 108-103.
With Thabeet struggling and
Blair succeeding, I have to ask:

who’s_scouting these players?

I Everybody who watched Pitt
play Connecticut last year saw
Blair manhandle Thabeet under

the rim, ﬂipping him over his '

back for a rebound and probably
shouting, “I AM DEJUAN, RULER

McGrady’s expiring contract. In a few short
months, future cap space became more valu-
able than top prospect Hill.

Meanwhile, nobody dared to take Blair in
the ﬁrst round because his knees apparently
would give out within the week. The scouts
had a right to be nervous, since Blair had
surgery on both knees as a sophomore —
in high school. I must say, he really hasn’t

the Indiana Pacers, though, he was a ﬁrst
round pick to help resurrect a franchise with
three straight losing seasons. The Pacers
this year: 19-39. Make it four straight los-

It will happen in April’s NFL draft, too.
Some poor team will invest a lot of money,
a high draft pick and years of development
in Tim Tebow. It won’t work out.

Mel Kiper says. _

And when a team goes against the media’s
enlightened projections, it faces a backlash
of colossal proportions.

The Houston Texans deﬁed the consen-
sus in 2006 and passed on Reggie Bush for
defensive end Mario Williams. A visibly
frazzled Kiper harangued the franchise,

"predicting that Williams would bust and

Reggie Bush or Matt Leinart —- the steal of
the draft! — would make Houston regret
its decision for eternity.

Williams made the Pro Bowl in 2008 and
2009, and the Texans quietly took Steve
Slaton as their running back in the third
round ofthe 2008 draft. Slaton last season:
1,659 yards from scrimmage. Bush’s best
season: 1,307 yards.

Of course, things like this won’t stop
post-draft grades to come out the day after
the draft. It won’t stop teams from selecting
playerslike Tim Tebow orSean May way too
high. It won’t stop Hasheem Thabeet from
receiving a deal for more $4 million before
playing an NBA — or D-League —— game.
And it won’t stop teams from criminally
