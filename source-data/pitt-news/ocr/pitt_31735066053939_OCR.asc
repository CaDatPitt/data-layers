ACLU files  
suit against
county public
defenders

Ben Jackson

   

 

Yesterday, the American Civil Liberties
Union ﬁled a class action lawsuit against the
Allegheny County Public Defender system.

The defendants named in the case are
the Allegheny County Salary Board, County
Commissioners Lawrence Dunn, Bob
Cramer, and Michael Dawida, and Chief
Public Defender Kevin Sasinoski.

The suit alleges that indigent defendants
are being deprived of their right to adequate
criminal defense provided by the Sixth and
14th Amendments. ’

A fact sheet provided by the ACLU says
that the district attomey’s ofﬁce had a budget
that was approximately three times larger
thanthe public defender’s oﬂice in 1996. In
addition, according to Claudia Davidson, of
the Healy, Davidson, & Homack law ﬁrm,
when the public defender program’s budget
was cut by one third, the prosecutor’s office
only received a cut of two percent

"This is not just a matter of money. We
want to take a real comprehensive look at the
[conditions of the public defenders oﬂice],”
Davidson said.

“I would stress that this is a lawsuit that
has been engendered by historical defects in
the public defender system. It is not a reac-
tion to recent budget cuts; it has deeper
roots,” said Jere Kravkolf, one of the lawyers
for the plaintiifs.

The case focuses on three general areas:
excessive caseloads, insufﬁcient number of
attorneys, and a lack of resources in the face
of the prosecutor’s oﬂice.

The ACLU says that the public defend-
ers are asked to handle between 600 to 1,000
cases a year while the national recommen-
dation is for no more than 150 felonies, 400
misdemeanors, or 200 juvenile cases to be
handled by one lawyer. The caseload
also increased this year though the number
of public defenders declined after budget
cuts.

Finally, the ACLU said the public

Presidentol Greensburg campus resigns

Tom Scanlon and Mike Swanson
 .. .. .., ' .  '

     

George F. Chambers, president of

University Of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg, has announced his retire-
ment, effective Jan. 1, 1997.

Chambers had been planning his
retirement for awhile, but wanted to wait
until the time was right. ’ .

“I would have announced my retire
ment sooner,” Chambers said, “but I felt
it would be better for the University if
we waited until a chancellor was found.”

Chambers has been president of
Pitt-Greensburg since 1980. Upon his
retirement, he will become president-
emeritus. He also will serve as chairman
of the University of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg Foundation, the campus’
fundraising body.

As of yet, no plans have been made
to ﬁnd Chambers’ successor. University
officials said that a\search committee
will be formed, but didn’t specify how

. SOOII.

Pitt-Greensburg experienced signif-
icant development during Chambers’
tenure. “When I came here, there was
little in the way of facilities. I helped
build or acquire every building-and ﬁeld
on this campus,” he said. _

Chambers ran a successful capital
campaign, which raised $22 million for
major renovations to the campus. These
renovations included the addition of res-
idential living facilities. This allowed
the enrollment to double in size to 1,150
students. '

Pitt Provost James Maher agreed
that the campus has seen substantial
improvement under Chambers’ guid-

ance. .

“During his 16 years as president,
the stature and reputation of Pitt-
Greensburg has grown signiﬁcantly, and
we’re all pleased that even in retirement,
Dr. Chambers will be continuing his
involvement with the campus,” Maher
said in a press release.

Chambers takes great pride in the
work he’s done at Pitt-Greensburg. ‘‘I lit-
eraﬂy built this campus,” he said.

Under Chambers’ direction, the I

campus developed into a four—year
degree granting unit of the University
and expanded its curriculum to meet a
broader spectrum of community needs.

“We worked off a 10-year master '

plan for the University’s growth, that we
essentially’ comp1eted,” Chambers said.-'

Fraternal Order of Police
throws support to Clinton

BAGHDAD —' The caution of its Persian
Gulf allies has cast doubts upon the United
States’ potential capability to quickly latmch
signiﬁcant military operations against Iraq.

Defense Secretary Wﬂliarn Perry visited
Kuwait Sunday to seek approval for the dis4
patch of thousands of U.S. troops to strength-
en forces on Iraq’s southem border, but left
with only a promise that the request would be
considered. a

This development came as the United
States struggled to mass Army, Air Force,
and Navy forces against Iraqi dictator
Saddam Hussein in a Persian Gulf region that
appears increasingly uneasy with the effort.

The cautiousness of the Persian Gulf
allies is certain to brew political problems for
President Clinton as he attempts to manage
the Iraq confrontation in the middle of a pres-
idential election campaign. Pittsburgh Post

Experts coming for SGB sponsored internship seminar

Alexa Seretti

 
      

If lack of on-the-job experience
makes you cringe at the prospect of
handing" a resume to a prospective
employer, then look no more —
your Student Government Board

wants to help.
Last night members of the
Student Government Board

unveiled a plan to bring two intern-
ship placement specialists to Pitt
for a seminar on Oct. 14. Mark
Oldman and Samer Hamadeh are
the only nationally recognized
experts on the subject of internships

and have lectured extensively at
colleges and universities across the
nation.

SGB members Justin DalMo1in
and Cyrus Zolghadri devoted most
of their summer vacation to bring-
ing this seminar to Pitt.

“This is our baby, we are com-
mitted to showing students’ how
important it is to have internship
experience when looking for a job
in any field,” Zolghadri said.

Oldman and Hamadeh will pre-
sent a 90-minute seminar on how to
go about finding internships and
turning them into permanent posi-
tions. They will also give students

an idea of what companies look for
in prospective employees.

Both men have served in 11'

internships collectively and have
interviewed over 1,000 interns in
organizations ranging fro1n’MTV to
the CIA. These accounts are fea-
tured in theirmost recent book “The
Internship Bible.”

“I don’t think people understand
how important internships really
are,” DalMolin said. “If a person
has nothing on their resume but a
4.0 grade point average, and some-
one else has a lower grade point
average but more experience, that
person will be more likely to get the

In addition to better preparing

ACLU

defenders’ office does not have the resources
for legal research or case investigators. This
means that the lawyers have to do all
research themselves, including visiting crime
scenes and serving subpoenas.

“Not even the best defense lawyer could
provide adequate defense under Allegheny
County conditions,” said Vic Walczak of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the ACLU. V

The suit has been ﬁled on behalf of three
plaintiffs who have been defended by court
appointed attorneys. One of those cases
involved theft, the second was a juvenile
case, and the third centered around involun-
tary commitment of a person to a mental
institution.

The ACLU said these plaintilfs met
their defense lawyers literally minutes before
their hearing was to begin._

- Their lawyers did not have enough time
to prepare an adequate defense, according to
Walczak. _ ,

Walczak said the three cases are indica-
tive of almost all the cases handled by the
Allegheny County public defenders.

“We’ve taken cases that are representa-
tive. We didn’t comb throughq2,000 cases to
ﬁnd honor stories,” Walczak said.

Krakoif said the lawsuit is not the fault

Thursday, September ‘I9, ‘I996

of the lawyers worldng in the department.

“We’re trying to change [the way the
system works] without: placing blame on
individual defenders; it’s the system we’re
working on,” Krakoﬁ" said.

The time frame for handling this case
will depend on how the county reacts,
according to Krakolf. The county can either
try to disrnissthe case _or answer the com-
plaint, which would shorten the litigation
time.

“This is part of the national trend that
money is tight everywhere,” said Walczak.
“Once again, it is a matter of scapegoating
the poor.” .

Walczak said cutting funding -for the
public defender system is an attack on the
rights of people who can’ta1ford to hire their
own lawyers because it denies them access
to equal rights under the law. '

Robin Dahlberg said that the national
ACLU is concerned about “the inclination of
the government to de-flmd legal services of
the poor.” '

She also said that there is a similar law-
suit pending in Connecticut and other juris-
dictions are being examined to see if their
public defender programs are doing an ade-
quate job.

do that didn’t get done.”

Chambers has no definite plans for
retirement, but would like to escape
Pennsylvania’s winters, possibly to
Florida where he owns a condominium.
He also is interested in ﬂying and hang-
gliding.

Previously, Chambers served as
president of Nassau Community College
in Garden City, N.Y.. He also has held
development positions at Pitt and the

Rick Boyd says there's no place he’d rather be than Pitt

I Drybur_gl1

   

K.»

On the outside he may look like
your average dad, but in reality he’s
the hard-working leader of the
Campus Police.

He is Chief Rick Boyd, and he’s
been in charge of Pitt’s police force
for over two years.

Boyd graduated from the Police
Academy in 1972 and got his first
job as a patrol officer for Michigan
State University. Undercover nar-
cotics was his next task. He spent
four years in undercover operations
with the Michigan State Police
before going back to school and get-
ting his master’s degree from
Michigan State University in 1983.

A big hockey fan all of his life,
Boyd made the trip to Pittsburgh a
few times before he worked here to
watch the Penguins play. “I was
extremely impressed with this city,”

he said. “I thought it was beautiful.”

When he saw that Pitt was look-
ing for a new police chief he quickly
applied and was hired.

A lot of police departments
would take a guy with his credentials
in a second, but Boyd said there’s no
other place he’d rather be. “I love the
school.” he said. “I love the city. I

love the students here.”

Boyd said the urban campus of
Pitt especially appeals to him.

“The University of Pittsburgh is
the nicest urban campus I’ve ever
seen. You’ve got a beautiful urban
campus right in the heart of a big
city. What’s not to like?” he said.

Boyd said he is pleased with the
recent shutdown of Bigelow
Boulevard.

“I hope it is closed permanently,”
he said. “It will make things safer,
but I also think it will
create a center point
for the campus,
which would be nice
to see.”

Boyd said he was
also happy with Pitt’s
dedication to improv-
ing public safety in
Oakland. ,

“This school has given the police
department a great deal of support,”
Boyd said. “It’s the kind of support
you don’t find at other universities.”

The Pitt Police Department based
in Forbes Quad is the third largest
police force in Allegheny County.
Boyd said his offices answer over
35,000 calls a year. He said the
majority of problems on the campus
are the result of alcohol or substance

 

abuse.

Chief Boyd feels Pitt’s image has
improved due to the decline of
underage drinking in the past two
years.

“We have changed this police
department into a pro-active ‘mold.
We are fostering a group of officers
who are very professional and highly
trained in handling [the problem of
underage drinking],” Boyd said.

“At one point in time some peo-
ple were under the impression that
Oakland was a place
that 18 and 19-year-
old kids could drink
with immunity,” he
said. “When you have
an environment where
substance abuse is tol-
erated or wide open,
it’s a dangerous envi-
ronment. The idea of
zero tolerance [of underage drinking]
at Pitt makes a lot of sense.”

Boyd thinks one of Pitt’s biggest
problems is not crime itself but stu-
dents putting themselves in a posi-
tion to be victimized by crime.

“The problem is taking kids who
come from a non—urban environment
and educating them on how to live in
a big city,” he said. “I don’t want
anyone here to be frightened, but by

the same token I want everyone to be
realistic. If you’re going to be drunk
wandering the street at 3 a.m., you
might as well put a sign on your back
that says ‘victim.”’

Boyd was born in Colorado but
moved to Detroit, Mich. shortly
afterwards, where he grew up.

After high school, he attended
Michigan State University as an
English Writing major, but got draft-
ed into the army during the Vietnam
war where he was trained as a»mili-
tary police. Boyd spent two years in
the military, after which he came
back to Michigan State to finish up
his English degree.

Boyd went from being an English
major to becoming a cop because of
a “five—day—a-week one—credit typing
class” his junior year that was
mandatory for his major. He then
became ill and was hospitalized for a
few weeks.

He had missed too many days by
the time he returned to the class, and
wasn’t allowed to take the final, even
though he was sure he could pass it.
The teacher said he had to retake the
class.

Boyd said he hated the class so
bad that he changed his major to
criminal justice to avoid taking it
again.

upcoming year and pledged to
make good use of the student activ-
ity money at their disposal.

“Every program that we spend
even 50 cents of the student fee on,
we will make sure that it will be 50
cents well—spent,” Wuertele said.

Pitt’s College Republicans armed-

their members at Tuesday’s meeting with
information on voter registration, state
candidates’ platforms, and how to get on
MTV.

Marc Friedberg of the Student
Government Board spoke at the meeting
about some upcoming projects to get stu-

dents involved in politics, such as Project ‘

Pitt Vote and MI'V’s Choose or Lose Bus.

Friedberg said Project Pitt Vote is an
event organized by SGB to get as many
Pitt students registered to vote as possible
before the upcoming election in
November.

MTV’s Choose or Lose Bus will also
be on campus Sept. 24. The bus travels
around the country to various college
campuses promoting voting among
young adults, Friedberg said.

Students will be able to register to
vote at the MTV bus, as well as partici-
pate in a survey of their opinions on
issues relating to the presidential race.

Also speaking to the group on
Tuesday were state Senate candidates
Dick Reid and Tim Murphy.

Reid, who retired from Westinghouse
Electric Company in 1994, is running in
the 45th District against a favored career
politician—something Reid said he deﬁ-
nitely is not.

“I am not a politician and I never will
be. But I have the ability, the strength, and
the willingness to make a difference in
this state,” said Reid.

Reid said he would like to improve
the Pennsylvania court system by institut-
ing harsher penalties for first time offend-
ers, especially dmg users and dealers. He
also said he supported the downsizing of
federal and state governments in favor of
increased control for a larger local gov-
ernment system.

Reid asked for volunteers for his
campaign at the meeting. He said he
needed people willing to go door to door
and talk to voters and people to work the
phone booths and polls at his campaign

College Republicans hear from local candidates

headquarters come election time. Reid
said he feels young voters are the best
volunteers to have in his campaign.

“I am really pleased when I see
young people involved in politics because
there are very few of you out there. It is
important to get you involved because
you are the leaders of the future,” Reid
said.

Murphy is running in the 37th
Senatorial District, which is considered to
be the number one race in the state.

Murphy is a Pitt alumnus who
received his doctorate in psychology and
worked at Children’s Hospital and Magee
Women’s Hospital for several years
before opening a private practice.

Murphy said one of his main con-
cerns in the race is the terrible state of job
availability in Pennsylvania. Murphy said
he wants to change the fact that
Pennsylvania is the worst state in the
country in unemployment and the highest
in business taxes.

“The college graduates in this state
are in a neverending cycle that forces
them to leave the state to get a job,”
Murphy said. “If you elect republican
candidates to the state Senate, you can
change that cycle so that when you grad-
uate, you can work here and so can the
generations that will follow you.”

If elected, Murphy will be the only
member of the state Senate with a back-

ground in the health care ﬁeld. He said his
perspective will make him more knowl-
edgeable and better able to propose laws
concerning health care.

“[Republicans] will win [the elec-
tion] because we are focusing on families
and what is best for them, and that is hav-
ing jobs, education, and healthcare,”
Murphy said. “We will win because I
know when to listen and I know when to
act.”

The next meeting of the College

Republicans will be on Sept. 24 at 8:30 I

p.m. in the Kurtzman Room of the
William Pitt Union. Republican
Congressional candidate Bill Ravotti is
scheduled to be the guest speaker.

sure, stress, danger, and fear of
assault.”

Smith said there is empowerment
in learning “the science of move-
ment” and being in control in danger-
ous situations. He said people learn-
ing self—defense should also know
how to handle pressure properly and
how to get away from illegal drugs.

Smith, a Pitt Police officer and
police academy instructor, also pro-
vides .many opportunities for stu-
dents and the community to take
advantage of his programs.

The BYAM [Buy Yourself a
Minute] method is a program Smith
designed as a comprehensive self-
awareness, self—defense course.

“BYAM tries to heighten percep-
tion and self control in a dangerous
situation,” Smith said. “When you
start to stress your vision is impaired,
your senses lessened. You have a
physical and chemical reaction, and
[the BYAM method] tries to condi-
tion students to deal with that.”

Smith also teaches “Fitness
Boxing,” a popular Pitt course that
he said is composed of 95 percent
women this term.

“Fitness Boxing” is an energetic,
hyped—up period of intense skill
learning and a medium to put away
the academic and social pressures of
the University, Smith said.

Smith said he also hopes to
redesign the multi-purpose room at
Trees Hall and introduc_e new work-
out equipment. He expects this will
encourage students to enroll in cours-
es like “Fitness Boxing.”

For people who might benefit
from these types of programs but
can’t afford them, the East-West
Martial Arts Club and Smith provide
scholarships.

“We don’t turn down anyone. If
-someone has it in their heart, mind,
or soul that they want to train then
we assist them,” Smith said. “But we
don’t just give away money. There
are social, physical and spiritual ben-
efits  We lift up the human spirit.”

Money from the “Ultimate
Force” demonstration will aid the
East-West Martial Arts Club and
Smith in assisting city youth.

Proceeds will go to fund summer
camps, free sports equipment,
reduced-fee karate lessons, and
scholarships for Pittsburgh city youth
as well as highlighting Smith’s pro-
grams within Pitt.

The cost for area residents and
non—students is four dollars for chil-
dren and six dollars for adults.

Smith hopes that students and the
community will come check out the
“extravaganza” and participate while
they see some of the options avail-
able. B

Bacteria in the
water: are we safe?

How safe is residence hall life? Students are sup-
posed to be reassured by the measures taken by the
University to ensure our well being, such as campus
police, security guards, police phones, and the safety fea-
tures of the new IDs. These things are supposed to keep
us safe from external enemies, but what about pathogen-
ic bacteria? _ 4

Legionella bacteria was found in the Towers’ water
system. This is the bacteria which causes Legionnaires’
disease, a form of pneumonia which can be fatal. The
truth of the matter is that two cases were diagnosed this
summer in Marriott employees who worked in the
Towers. .

There is no reason to panic about this occurrence.
Legionella bacteria occur in small quantities nearly
everywhere and most people are completely safe. The
only way to contractthe disease is by inhaling it through
ﬁne water mist such as steam. However, given the fact
that there have been two documented cases of infection
in people who frequented Towers, there is cause for con-
cem.

Supposedly, it is extremely rare for anyone to get
infected with the disease, but two Marriott employees
were diagnosed with it this summer. Even though no stu-
dents have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease,
anyone who is ill should be tested immediately.

Yesterday, the Towers’ water system was ﬂushed
with scalding hot water to kill the bacteria. The other res-
idence halls have been tested and proven to be bacteria-
free. The University is also planning to install water ion-
ization equipment which will insure that the bacteria
does not get back into the water system. Now, there
should be no danger of catching Legionnaires’ disease.
The problem is that the University‘ was so slow to catch
on and do something about it.

Abortion and Iran are topics of debate 

A funny thing.
’ happened on the way
to biology class...

I will admit that advertise-
ments about abortion in news-
papers sometimes go a bit far
in the guilt department.
However, as a brief response
to p.r. taylor’s article which
was published ’in. the
Wednesday, Sept. 18 edition, I
would like to point something
out which I believe she over-
looked. The decision is not as
simple as she makes it out to
be, and it certainly is not just

a decision about “the contents

of a woman’s uterus.” The last
biology class Itook informed
me that at the point when most
women find out they’re preg-
nant (around 2-3 months) the
child already has a beating
heart, functioning lungs, and a
brain that can perceive sensa-
tion.

Maybe anti-abortion liter-
ature is propaganda, but so is
what ms. taylor is writing. To
say things like “if you are par-
alyzed with guilt over having
an abortion, don’t have one; if
you feel paralyzed with guilt
over having a baby, don’t have
one” shows a remarkable and
fundamental lack of compas-
sion, disrespect, and misun-
derstanding of the entire abor-
tion issue.

How I feel about abortion
is irrelevant to anyone else’s
opinionseand most of us don’t
care about ms. taylor’s opin-

ion. However, I believe the
uncompassionate and sweep-
ing arguments of her article
reflect a tendency toward
Nazi-ism on her part alone. In
the future, please do all
women who are considering
this momentously difficult

decision a favor and keep your

opinions about
uterus to yourself.

Iranians need
understanding, not
stereotypes

I am writing this in
response to an article by
Daniel Weiss that appeared in
The Pitt News on Sept. 4
titled, “Vying to be the King
of Arab Solidarity.” I believe
that the quality of our school’s
education should be represent-
ed by the school newspaper.
The Pitt News should portray
the intelligence and ideals of
our students. Therefore, I was
displeased by Daniel’s article.
We have a fine political sci-

ence program at our
University and I believe his
article did some disservice to
this department and its intelli-
gent students.

Mr. Weiss referred t_o Iran
as a nation seeking to be the
“King of Arab Solidarity.”
This could not possibly be
true because as any astute
social science student knows,
Iran is not an Arab country.
Iranians have a language, his-
tory, religion, and culture
unique to themselves and dif-
ferent from the Arabs. Also
his reference to “Iran’s suicide
bombers” serves to discredit
Iranian Americans and gives
them a negative stereotype. In
fact, I am unaware of any inci-
dents where Iranians have
engaged in suicide bombings.
If Mr. Weiss knows of any
then at least he could have
worded his statements differ-
ently, so as not to portray a

negative stereotype of
Iranians and Iranian
Americans.

I suggest that next time
Mr. Weiss would like to write

a an intellectual column, he at

least research some basic
background information.
Also, a correction concerning
this column would serve the
interests of The Pitt News and
the University community.
Thank you for your attention
and best wishes to you and
The Pitt News staff in your
future endeavors.
Respectfully Yours,

Mike Bahoosh

 

 

Tupac had a chance to make a dif

 

If the death of hip hop artist Tupac
Shakur teaches us nothing else, it’s
that bullets hurt. Hell, bullets kill.

Tupac’s death was unfortunate,
yes; no one deserves to die the way he
did, but I’m tired of people trying to
make him into a saint just because he
passed away or saying that he was so
great and his death was such a traves-
ty.

But has anyone said to herself that
maybe it was bound to happen? Even
if those bullets weren’t meant for
Shakur, it was only a matter of time.
He doomed himself a long time ago
with his “Thug Life” image.

I am aggravated by his death, not
because he died, not because hip-hop
lost a dope lyricist, but because I don’t
feel great sympathy for him. I’ve
always supported his music, but I
can’t think of any other reason to be
concerned.

All I keep playing over in my head

. is all the times I’ve seen him act like a

fool on TV and further contradict him-
self.

How can someone make a song
about respecting women and then get
arrested for rape at the same time?
Damn.

I was a supporter because I
thought he truly represented the con-

THE PITT NEWS

ﬂicts and stresses within urban
America. He let people know about
AmeriKKKa"s poisoned ideologies.
But he traded in his morals for a
Beamer and a gold watch.

I’m not trying to diss him after his
death. However, let’s be honest. How
many of us were with him mentally up
until the point he started that “Thug
nigga, Westside ‘til I die” ra—ra? How
many of us were asking, “Why is
Tupac trippin’?” He ﬂipped the script
on everybody. It got to the point that
what he said wasn’t important any-
more.

I know media forces played a
dynamic role in his demise. He never
received major exposure until after the
negative press surfaced. The name
Tupac became synonymous with “jail”
in the media, and you couldn’t ﬂip on
the TV without seeing him in hand-
cuffs. The media helped to promote
his thug image.

_ Perhaps Tupac was going through
some type of inner conﬂict, like
Hamlet. Is it better to inform, uplift,
and be broke, or wave your nine—_milly

-and make millions?

He made a difficult but poor
choice.

Like the title of his last CD said,
all eyes were on him. With all of the
attention on him, he could have tried
to enlighten and educate. The media
would have certainly left him alone,

since positive news is like kryptonite
to them.

Instead, he opted to hold his nutz,
yelling “Thug Life, Thug Life!” If
there was another side to Shakur, he
never showed it. He was too busy act-
ing hard for the cameras. I think he got
caught up in his Bishop character from
the movie Juice.

He held an enormous amount of
justifiable rage, but he didn’t know
how to channel his frustrations. I’m a
young black male feeling maddening
stress everyday, despite the fact that
I’m trying to improve myself. But I’m
not going to spit venom on my people
and blow herb smoke in their faces
just for the sake of “representin”’ or
“keepin’ it real.”

The responsibility for his actions
was his own.

After receiving five gunshot
wounds one evening in New York, you
would expect a normal man to tone
down somewhat. Instead, he was shot
in the head, missing a testicle, and still
opening his mouth to talk garbage:

After being arrested close to a
dozen times, you would expect a per-
son to say, “Damn, maybe I should
chill.” But no, not Tupac. Upon get-
ting out of prison, he screamed,
“Prison ain’t changed me, nigga.”

Someone was bound to test him
again. He thought he was Superman,
only now, the “S” on his chest stands

ferenc

e and lost II‘

for “See Ya.”

I do have some respect left for
Tupac. Although  think he sold out to
capital gain, he still symbolizes a
struggle, a struggle to maintain amidst
the rubble of urban decay. But
America’s temptations got the best of
him.

While preaching against the evil,
he ended up embracing it, and it
altered his thought processes like
coke.

So to all those who thought of him
as a hero and idolize his thugging
ways, think about him before you step
outside. You’re probably in the same
situation right now that he was in, and
you don’t even realize it.

- . Think about the fact that although
you believe you’re “keepin it real”
(and by the way, baggy jeans, blunts,
and boots do not a thug make), you’re

obviously setting yourself up for your

own funeral.

Think about Tupac’s burning body
in the incinerator. Think about his
ashes in the vase. That could be you.

In these days of “representin’,”
recognize the consequences and
change. Besides, the only thing truly
“keepin’ it real” is Death...Just ask

Tupac.

Theron C. Warren thinks there’s more

to the ﬁtture than the “thug life” has
to offer. '

Tupac was no role model, it's time for the torch to be passed

 

Less than a week ago, music’s most
unoriginal genre, rap, suffered a devas-
tating blow — the world’s most overrat-
ed, commercially-successful “thug,”
Tupac -Shakur, died of a respiratory ill-
ness.

Tupac’s lung problems weren’t
from cigarettes or the endless supply of
weed he inhaled, they were the result of
a drive-by shooting.

Tupac hung on for a few days
hooked up to a respirator, despite losing
a lung (not the only body part he’s lost
in a shooting). The shooting occurred
outside a Las Vegas hotel casino follow-
ing an argument inside.

According to the Associated Press,
Tupac sat in the passenger seat of a car
driven by Death Row Records president
and CEO, Suge Knight, who is the
bodyguard’ of gangsta rap (which is,
thankfully, a dying form of “music” .
Tupac reportedly took at least five bul-
lets. Knight received only minor head
injuries from shrapnel.

Poor Tupac, former leader of a fol-
lowing called “Thug Life.” It was the
second time that people had tried to kill
the man who got his start with an origi-

nal, innovative rap group— Digital
Underground.

During November of 1994, Tupac
says he walked into an ambush staged

by former friend the Notorious B.I.G., a

300—pound lard—ass whose unintelligible
raps deal with pimpin’ hoes and being a
general stud, and Sean “Puffy” Combs
—- an. East Coast equivalent to Knight,
though not as large.

Tupac took ﬁve bullet wounds that

' day, including one to the head and one

that knocked off a testicle. Thank God,
he was still able to reproduce, as he
assured us in a Vibe magazine interview.
Unfortunately, there’s been no confir-
mation of Tupac passing down his con-
siderable “skills.”

All of America wept for Shakur as
his bandaged body went to court the
next day on charges of rape and
sodomy. Spending 11 andl/2 months in
San Quentin, he denied his guilt right to
the end.

At first, I was glad he went to
prison. I thought he could turn this into
something positive, like telling street
hoodlums that “thug life” was not the
way to go.

My dreams came true when Tupac
told Vibe magazine in an interview
while he was incarcerated, “If thug life
is real, then let somebody else represent
it, because I’m tired of it. I represented
it too much.”

Wow! Words of wisdom from

Tupac? Was he really going to change
his ways? He came across in that inter-
view as a man who had come to grips
with a sketchy past, a past that gloriﬁed
gang life, robbery, killing, drive—bys,
and hating anybody that wasn’t his skin
color.

That interview changed my mind. I
thought that Tupac would now become
a worthy role model like Ken Griffey Jr.
or Neil Diamond. Tupac, for the first
time, seemed like someonevwith integri-
ty and initiative.

Apparently, once a “thug,” always a
“thug.” Once released, Tupac went back
to his old ways and adopted Death Row
as his new label. He said the toughest
thing about being in jail was that during
those first two days he couldn’t smoke
weed (I can feel his pain on that one.)

Tupac represented everything that
is wrong with rap music.

Number one, if rap didn’t utilize
drum machines and constantly use beats
from other songs, where would a guy
like Tupac be? He’d probably have died
long ago. Most rap lyrics aren’t very
original either. Most groups and MCs
brag about how many blunts they can
roll in a sitting or how many ﬂy
hoochies they tagged after the show.
When they’re not rapping about that,
they’re rapping about puttin’ a cap in
your ass or dropping names from car-
toons and professional wrestlers.

Tupac’s “music” was no different

than any other gangsta rapper’s,
although he was more successful than
most because of his acting career
(something he did well) and his bad rep-
utation.

Rap needs a facelift. There are some
rap groups out there that don’t act hard
and still keep a catchy beat. The
Pharcyde and A Tribe Called Quest
come to mind.

If rap musicians continue to be role
models, these groups should‘ be looked
up to. They inject their styles with orig-
inality, plus they’re funny while still
knowing what’s going on in the world.

Gangsta rap should die. Maybe
Tupac’s death, which didn’t come as
unexpected, will alert the masses. Tupac
had a “Thug Life” tattoo and died
believing that motto. That’s the point:

he died just like too many others. Jerry‘

Garcia, a man I idolize, ruined his life
with heroin and cocaine. His music can
still be enjoyed (I do every day), but fol-
lowing in his footsteps is a mistake.

Tupac fans should be wary as well.
If you follow his music and preachings
too closely, you’ll end up just like him
— dead, with nobody caring.

Tupac once said, “I don’t have no
fear of death. My only fear is coming
back reincarnated.” Let’s hope he
comes back with a brain and some tal-
ent.

Mike Kovak is grateﬁil not to be dead.

Clinton bash

  

I have to admit that a smile comes to

gmy face when I imagine the horror the

Republicans may be feeling right now con-
cerning President Clinton’s double—digit
lead in some polls.

Things like, “Here’s a guy who we
know to be totally corrupt. He’s a card-car-
rying liberal who changes his political posi-
tions with the wind - and stole some of ours
in the process. He and his cronies have
engaged‘ themselves in all sorts of shady

deals, especially that Whitewater thing
down inArkansas — which we’d have nailed
him-on already if our enemies in the liberal
press would have only cooperated.
“Instead of serving his country in
Vietnam, he pulled some elaborate stunt to
evade the draft. On top of that, he kept a
woman for 12 years and has continually hit
on others - can’t say we blame him, since
his wife is a power-hungry shrew. Let’s face
‘it, this guy has no moral character whatso-
ever and doesn’t deserve to be where he is.
“So why can’t we beat him?”
I offer one theory: they’re no better.
The GOP may not want to acknowl-
edge this, but it has a big problem with char-
acter itself - especially since some of its
more conservative members often crow

about “moral values.” Don’t think the vot-
ers don’t see the hypocrisy;

Let’s see - where shall I start? How
about 1981, when then—President Reagan
fired the nation’s air—traﬂic controllers for
going on an admittedly illegal strike? Now,
on the surface, he took an immediate, deci-
sive action which most applauded. at the
time. However, that’s not the whole story.

According to a report on ABC News’
Nightline, the Professional Air Traffic

"Controllers Union (PATCO) had written to

each of the three presidential candidates the
year before, in hopes that one of them
would consider their complaints about job
burnout and outdated equipment, among
other things. Reagan replied positively — the
only candidate to reply at all - and as a

result, PATCO endorsed him for president.

However, after the election, the gov-
ernment eventually offered PAT Co a con-
tract which addressed none of their con-
cerns, leading to the controllers’ walkout
and their subsequent dismissal, and that
decision to can them sent an unmistakable
signal to the business community, as corpo-
rations got tough with their workers, telling
them that “if you won’t work for this con-
tract, we’ll ﬁnd people who will” and doing
their best to break labor unions. We see
those effects today.

Clinton dodging the draft? More
phoney baloney. So did Dan Quayle and

Jack Kemp (both of whom ended up in_

reserve units), as well as Texas senator Phil
Grarnrn. Now, conservative columnist
William F. Buckley, Jr. suggested that
Grarnrn’s deferment was routine, but that’s
not the point. You see, the aforementioned
GOPers, to the best of my knowledge, Sup-
ported the Vietnam War, while Clinton
actively opposed it. Whatever your posi-
tion, you have to admit that at least he had

_ the gurrrption to act on his convictions, _
which is more than you can say for his crit-

rcs.

Speaking of his critics, I caught Oliver
North on the Comedy Charmel’s show
“Politically Incorrect” last month saying
that Clinton’s cabinet and advisors “should

be in jail now.” Want to talk about audacity? '

Here’s a man who was convicted of
three felonies (which were overturned on
technicalities) of selling arms to our enemy
Iran at an inﬂated price and then using the
proceeds to fund a CL'X—formed force

‘implemented to overthrow the Nicaraguan

government in violation of U.S. law. With
recent revelations that Nicaraguan cocaine
barons also helped fund ﬂie Contras - with
proﬁts made in this country - the question
arises: Did North work with them at all?

Sex scandals? How about Clarence
Thomas, whom we learned was a porn
addict at his Supreme Court nomination
hearings? And both Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich have left wives, the latter because
he wanted a younger woman — he pulled out
a tablet to go over the divorce settlement
right after his soon—to—be—ex—wife came out
of cancer surgery! Vanity Fair reported
rumors of George Bush’s affairs, and I still
haven’t- heard any explanation as to the
identity of one Paula Parkinson — and, more
importantly, her relationship with Quayle.

Changing positions? Look at Dole-
Kemp. Dole, long a deﬁcit hawk, now pro-
motes supply—side economics, complete
with a budget—busting and inﬂationary 15-
percent tax cut. Kemp has walked away
from 1ong—held stances opposing irnmigra—
tion reform and supporting affirmative
action. I could go on, but...

Some Republicans have suggested
that, in order to win, Dole should hit Clinton
hard on the “character” issue. Bad move.

The president is an effective counter-
puncher, and has plenty of ammunition.

TNIVERSITY OF PITTSEUREET
NEWS UPDATE ON TOWERS RESIDENCE HALL

This is an update and clariﬁcation of information canied by local news media.

The University of Pittsburgh in conjunction with Allegheny County Health Department
investigated two cases of Legionnaires Disease that occurred in Marriott employees earlier this
summer. As a result of these investigations, the Towers water system was tested and found to
contain small amounts of the bacteria that causes Legionnaires Disease. lnorder to assure the
continued safety of the Towers water system, University officials‘ and the Health Department have g
decided to superheat the water, a step expected to kill any Legionella bacteria present. ‘

The purpose of this bulletin is to inform you of the ﬂushing procedure and to enlist your
cooperation to avoid the possible burns that could result from inadvertent useof superheated
water. We are also providing some factual information concerning the minimal risk of students
becoming ill. Some frequently asked questions include:

0 Are there any precautions I should take?

No, the risk of Legionnaires disease is very low for healthy individuals since Legionella
primarily infects susceptible individuals, such as thosewith chronic lung disease, immune
compromised people and the elderly.

0 What are the symptoms of this disease?
Ifthe bacteria enter the lung, it can cause a pneumonia. Symptoms may include loss of
appetite, weakness, muscle‘ ache, fever, dry cough, nausea or diarrhea.

0 How serious is this disease?

There are many effective antibiotics used to treat Legionnaires disease. As with other
respiratory tract infections, proper medical treatment is essential. The individuals diagnosed this
summer have returned to work and are doing well. .

0 What if I feel sick or have other questions?

The Student Health Service is available to answer your questions and provide any
treatment if necessary. 4  

0‘ What is being done to decontaminate the plumbing system?

' A system known as “heat and ﬂush” will be used, where the boiler system temperature is
increased to 70° C. The superheated water will be run through all of the sink spouts and showers
to kill any bacteria colonizing these sites. All ﬂoor bathroom facilities will be closed during the
ﬂushing process. This may require several hours to assure complete ﬂushing of the system. This
is for your protection and we request your cooperation. The University and the Health
Department experts will continue to monitor the system to assure your safety.

Secondary must stop
big play offense

Kevin Lilley

Last weekend, the Pitt Panther secondary
gave up only 193 passing yards, and forced
Houston’s Chuck Clements to complete 22
passes to get them.

The Cougars’ short passing game proved
eﬁective anyway, but not without an assist from
nearly 300 yards on the ground.

Saturday, everything changes.

While the Ohio Buckeyes are not consid-
ered a passing team by many, they have
become one m the absence of last year’s
Heisman trophy winner, Eddie George. In their
one game this season against Rice, the
Buckeyes threw for 315 yards — good enough
to keep them ranked ninth nationally despite
two bye weeks.

A larger concern for the Panthers is how I

quarterback Stanley Jackson racked up this
massive total + by throwing only twelve com-
plete passes. ’

completion. The reality works out to a big—play
potential that the Panthers have yet to face this
season.

“Naturally, we’re going to try, and ﬁt up our
man-to—man defense better,” said Pitt Defensive
Backs Coach Tony Pierce. “We’ll try to play a
little more deep coverage with our safeties, not
allowing the deep balls down the middle. We’d
rather have the ball go down the sideline.”

Forcing the ball down the sideline means
relying on strong safety Curtis McGee and free
safety John Jenkins to shut down the middle of
the ﬁeld. Both are coming off good statistical
games, with McGee’s ten tackles leading the
Panther defense and Jenkins making the garne’s
only interception. V . .

Their mission Saturday isn’t an easy one
— keeping OSU’s Mike Wiley and Dave
Boston between themselves and the end zone.
Wﬂey caught only two passes against Rice, but
still earned over 100 yards on the day. Boston
made just one reception, but it went for 72
yards.

Eddie George’s 122 yards, Ohio State bull-

en route to a convincing 54-14 victory last
season.

George can thank an imposing offen-
sive line, led by Outland Trophy candidate
Orlando Pace.

This season, Pace may very well be the
offensive lineman in the country, and is
without question the best left tackle. Just as
Joe Patemo once said about Tony Dorsett,

“How many ways can you say the word’

‘great?’” Coaches and players opposing
Ohio State wonder, “How many ways can
you say the word ‘huge?’”

The junior stands in at 6-foot—5, weighs
an astronomical 330 pounds, and is
extremely mobile on run and pass blocking.

“Pace is a_ good athlete,” OSU Head
Coach John Cooper said. “He is a big,
strong football player. The best thing about
him, though, is his foot speed.”

Also returning to the line are senior
right guard LeShun Daniels, a 285—pound
senior and junior center Eric Gohlstin.
Gohlstin weighs in at 295 pounds.
Replacing Jamie Sumner is Brooks Burris,
a 295-pound right tackle, and finishing out
a solid ﬁve is freshman Rob Murphy.
Murphy only weighs 252, by far the small-
est lineman at OSU.

The Ohio State line averages 6—foot—5
and 292 pounds.

Pin needs to pad its schedule

 

The Pitt football program dramatically needs a
change.

But I am not proposing hiring a new coach or over-
hauling the whole athletic department. These changes
are far too drastic for what I believe is an easy solution.

What Pitt really needs to turn around their sagging

program is more pushovers.
Call them patsies or whimps, but Pitt needs more
easy wins. .
Winning is the bottom line in athletics, and unfor-
tunately for Pitt, in the last seven years, wins have been
extremely hard to come by.
That’s why I’m suggesting alterations in the sched-
uling for future years.
As the football program now stands, Pitt is severe-
ly overrnatched in many games. Pitt football is in a
down period and therefore carmot compete with teams
like Notre Dame and Ohio State. \

houses, why not play lesser teams, teams that the
Panthers have a viable chance of beating. Non—confer—
ence teams, like Kent State University this year and
Eastern Michigan University last year, nicely pad the
Panthers’ win-loss record. While they may not bring
the interest or fans that a team like Notre Dame will,

I’m certainly not suggesting eliminating all quality
teams from Pitt’s schedule, but as I see it, each year
since the Big East Conference’s inception, there have
been national powerhouses inside the conference.
Often, there are three, four, or even ﬁve Big East teams
in the top 25. For instance, this year Miami, Virginia
Tech, and Syracuse are all in the top 25, and West
Virginia is knocking on the door. This means that Pitt is
forced to play quality teams within the conference.
While it would be nice to think that Pitt has a chance to
beat those teams, in reality, teams in the top 25 are
extremely more talented than Pitt.

That is why I am proposing scheduling a substan-
tially easier non-conference schedule for the next few
years. Playing away games at the Golden Dome in
South Bend and at the Horseshoe in Columbus is
ridiculous. Both Notre Dame and Ohio State have rabid

If you’re a college football fan, which
I assume you are if you’re reading this,
make sure you clear your social calendar

Tennessee is not only the best game of the

been salivating over this year’s rematch
ever since.

LSU (1-0) at Auburn (3-0) —
Tradition—rich LSU armounced to the col-
lege football world that they were back
with last season’s 12-6 upset of Auburn in
Death Valley. At Aubum, Teiry Bowden
set himself up for unrealistically high
expectations by going 11-0 in his first sea-
son on the Plains and many alumni are
upset with last season’s _8-3 record.
Bowden’s predicament brings back mein-
oiies of how an 11-1 season was consid-
ered an absolute disaster at Pitt in the early

19803. Second Blue Plate Upset Special-

of the Week - LSU 29, Aub1u'n 24.
Boston College (1-1) at Michigan (2-
0) — I’m not sure what is a worse sign for
BC, their 45-7 drubbing at home last week
by-Virginia Tech or their opening week 24-
21 overtime win over Hawaii. Hawaii lost
last week to Wyoming, 66-0. You have to
admire Michigan for playing a tough non-
conference schedule which also includes
Colorado and UCLA. Michigan 30,
Boston College 17. -
East Carolina (1-1) at South
Carolina (2-0) — South Carolina is con-
sidered one of the toughest places to play
in ﬂie country. In fact, when those rednecks
get really riled up, the upper deck of the
stadium actually wavers, prompting a for-
mer coach to admonish the fans, “If it ain’t
swayin’, we ain’t playin’.”

be very popular with everyone in the state
except the man who rriatters most, Athletic
Director Vince Dooley, who dumped Goff
last year after an injury-riddled 6-6 season.
If Georgia loses this game, 6-6 is going to
look pretty good because the Bulldogs will
struggle to win ﬁve. Georgia 20, Texas
Tech 17.

Georgia Tech (2-0) at North
Carolina (2-0) — When Miami joined the
Big East several years ago, many thought
that the Hurricanes would dominate the
conference and that the only real suspense
would be the battle for second place. That
obviously hasn’t happened, as the ‘Canes
have won only one championship in three
years of round-robin conference play. On
the other hand, new member Florida State
has more or less dominated the ACC as
predicted. If anyone is going to challenge
FSU this year, it will be North Carolina,
who already owns the most impressive vic-
tory of the young college season with a win
over Syracuse in the Dome. This game was
tempting as a Blue Plate Upset Special, but
Carolina will squeak by. North Carolina
27, Georgia Tech 24.

Indiana (2-0) at Kentucky (0-2) --
The Hoosiers barely nipped Miami (Ohio)
last week by intercepting them late in the
game near their own goal line, thus spoil-
ing a Blue Plate Upset Special. Kentucky
Coach Bill Curry is one of the most decent
men in sports, but he’s gone if Kentucky
doesn’t start to show some progress. Last
year, Curry did manage to lure the nation’s
top recruit, quarterback Tim Couch, to
Lexington. Kentucky 38, Indiana 31.

Syracuse (0-1) at Minnesota (2-0) —
Just about every preseason magazine had
Syracuse in the top 10 and quarterback
Donovan McNabb as the Big East player
of the year, but both Syracuse and McNabb
looked bad against North Carolina. They
always say that a team improves most from
the first to the second game, and there’s no
way that Syracuse is going to lose to a Big
Ten doorrnat. Syracuse 41, Minnesota 20.

Penn State (2-0) at Temple (1-1) —
Penn State no longer plays traditional
Eastern rivals Syracuse and West Virginia
because the Nits wanted them to play six
games in State College for every four at
their place. That Penn State would think
those proud programs would even consid-
er such an asinine request is one reason
why many people in college football con-
sider Penn State and Patemo to be class-
less. Temple, however, agreed. Penn State
48, Temple 21.

West Virginia (3-0) at Purdue (0-2)
—— Every ﬁve years, West Virginia man-
ages to make a serious rim at the national
title. In 1988, the 11-0 Mounties lost in the
Fiesta Bowl to Notre Dame only because
Major Hanis separated his shoulder in the
ﬁrst series of the game and was ineffective
thereafter. In 1993, the Mounties again
went 11-0 and had a 7-0 lead .before getting
jacked by Florida in the Sugar Bowl.
Could West Virginia be two years ahead of
schedule? They could be 7-0 and ranked in
the top 10 when they host Miami on Oct.
26. West Virginia 25, Purdue 10.

Buckeye wideouts but thought that they
stood out on ﬁlm as disciplined rout runners.
He said, “They can really mix you up. They
never give you the same look twice.”

If the safeties can force the OSU tan-
dem to the sidelines, it will fall to comer-
backs Rashaad Whitmill and Chuck Brown
to stop the big playmakers. They were suc-
cessful at this in the Houston game, with the
longest pass totaling just 20 yards.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Pierce says that
the Ohio State offensive scheme has little or
nothing in common with the Cougar pass-
ing attack

‘”l‘hey’re diﬁerent than Houstonin that
they don’t come out with all the speed guys
at the same time,” said Pierce. “You rarely
see the four wide receivers [from OSU] that
Houston ran.”

Jenkins agrees with his coach’s assess-
ment of the Buckeye offense, saying that
“you can’t compare them — they’re almost
totally different. But both are very high-

powe .”
The feisty Buckeyes have had a week

to prepare since their 70-7 dismantling of
Rice, but Pierce does not expect them to
change their offensive formations or game
plan versus the Panthers. In other words, the
passing should be infrequent, but geared
toward the type of big—play production that
overwhelmed Rice.

Last season, the Buckeye big plays
came from the backﬁeld, with George piling
up his share of long—distance runs, including
some against the Panthers. While the Pitt
lineman and linebackers may get a reprieve
with the Heisman winner gone ﬁom the
backﬁeld, the secondary will not be as
lucky. _

“The thing about Ohio State is that they
can just reload,” said Pierce. ‘They always
have a lot of ﬁrepower. Stanley Jackson is
an excellent athlete. And they just have a
sense of conﬁdence that comes with playing
for Ohio State.”

pick then you were the man. That
technicality would take a couple of
minutes and then the ground rules
were set. Touch or tackle? Blitz or no
blitz? If no blitz, then just how many
Mississippis would the slow kid have
to count before he could wobble after
the quarterback? The preparation was
endless, but once it was in place, then
you had hours of action-packed, hard-
nosed gridiron action.

No matter where you were play-
ing, that field was the home field for
some of the players. They knew that
plot of land by heart and maybe they
were even lucky enough to have it be
their own backyard. The kid with the
big back yard was the most popular
kid on the block, next to the kid with

 

won 70-7. It doesn’t take a genius to
figure out that this Saturday could get,
and most likely will get, ugly for the
Panthers.

Keep in mind that the Panthers’
roster looks more like a hospital ward

attendance sheet. Punter Nate
Cochran, center Reggie Thomas,
defensive end Jason Chavis, tight end
Juan Williams, and running back
Dwayne Schulters will all miss the
game against the Buckeyes due to
injuries.

Week in and week out, I sit at the
computer and try to push out positive
words about the Panthers. I love Pitt
and I grew up watching the likes of
Darnell Dickerson and Alex Van Pelt
light up defenses for huge numbers. I

never even thought of going to school
anywhere else. Pitt is it, but I am a
realist at the same time. I can’t force
my mind to believe something that
my heart wants to so very badly. I
hope that Pitt pulls off the biggest
upset in school history, but at the
same time my money would go on
Ohio State, if I were a betting man.

The line on this game is 35 1/2
points and growing like a freshman
girl with no willpower at Eddie’s. The
best thing to remember this week is
that kickoff is at 12:30. So if your
bookie’s line is busy, keep calling
back ‘til you get through. This baby’s
a lock, and I don’t think the Buckeyes
will give Pitt many “redos.”’ Ohio
State 58- Pitt 10

 

“We do have a good’ offensive line,”

Cooper said.

The Buckeye defensive line is just as
good.
C_ooper’s ﬁrst line of defense is laden
with experience. They’re led by seniors
Matt Finkes and Mike Vrabel. Both weigh
260 pounds and last season, they stulfed
the Pitt running game to the tune of just 67
total yards rushing. Their consistent pres-
sure on former Pitt signal caller John Ryan
forced him intothrowing four intercep-
tions.

Joining Finkes and Vrabel on the four-
man front are senior Luke Fickell, who
started last season, and mammoth defen-
sive tackle Winﬁeld Gamett, who weighs
305 pounds.

in the biggest TV in his basement.

- . Over time, you would figure out a
way to have the games on your turf.
That was the biggest advantage a
team could have. You knew where the
gas lines stuck above the ground and
you could avoid them. You knew
where the dog liked to mark his terri-
tory and you stayed far away from
that area, but the biggest deal with
being at home was making the calls.

No matter how talented your team
was, if you had the power of the whis-
tle you had total control. If it was 4th-
and-goal and the pass hit the tree, then
it was obviously interference. And if
they put up a fight over the interfer-
ence call, then the next step was the.
ever-popular “redo.” If the redo didn’t
 go over well, then you always had the
‘ option of simply telling them to get
, out of your yard and then go inside
i your house. They would contemplate
l their final decision and then usually
concede to allow the redo in order to
solidify their open invitation to play
on your turf because, some day, they
1 will be on your side and they will be
able to make the calls.

The moral of this story so far has
been that you can always have the
upper hand when you’re at your own
house. You know what’s going on and
you feed off it.

So far this season, Pitt has gone 1-
2 at home and they are far from know-
ing what’s going on. In fact, the
Panthers are a good team away from
 being 0-3, when they should be 2-1,
maybe even 3-0. They’re not good,
1 and this week isn’t going to get any
% better as the team bus heads to wmumv _-K
Columbus to face the 7th-ranked Ohio   ﬁg?

football programs in the nation. Pitt is not yet
up to their level.

Some people may think this idea is ludi-
crous. They may say that playing top-10 teams

  

FROM PAGE 18 

 

' helps Pitt’s recruiting, not to mention bringing

in revenue for the school through national tele-
vision ratings. '

But realistically, how many top recruits
will be impressed with Pitt if we lost to Notre
Dame by 40 points? No matter what these
people say, embarrassment is not a good
recruiting tool. A good win-loss record is.

The money that Pitt generates through
television exposure is undeniable. It’s not real-
istic to believe that ESPN or NBC would want
to broadcast a Pitt-Houston rnatchup. So,
while Pitt may be excluded ﬁom badly needed

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

money, wins would ultimately help the recruit-
ing which wo11ld bring more wins ——
which would eventually make Pitt a top-25
team.

So the equation for making Pitt a winning
team is easy: scheduling easier non—confer-
ence opponents = more wins = better recruits
= top 25. Check out Penn State’s non—confer—
ence schedule if you don’t believe me.

After Pitt establishes itself as a winning
program, they could eliminate the patsies on
their schedule and replace them" with Notre
Dame, Texas, or even Penn State. By that time,
Pitt will be able to beat these teams because
they have conﬁdence and talent, two compo-
nents this year’s team lacks.

Hopefully in the next four or ﬁve years,
Pitt will beat these teams. At that time, Pitt
football will once again take its rightful posi-
tion as one of the ﬁner programs in the nation.

Free shows. More importantly,
good bands. Free hotel rooms. Four
days in Manhattan. Free beer. And
finally, as one post to a private, radio-
types-only e—mail list said, "sex with
people who like Stereolab."

Rock and roll.

Well, I did see some free shows,
they were good bands, and I drank
some crappy free.beer, but I had no
sex’ with Stereolab fans. Nobody else
I know did either._ ,

Nonetheless, I did learn some-

 

thing about the music industry, which-

almost makes up for it. Coming to
CMJ as the newly-crowned(?) station
manager and ex—music director at

,WPTS FM, my previous experience

of College Music Journal consisted of
stories from slackeresque predeces-
sors who didn't talk about much more
than the shows and the freebies.
That's all part of it, too, but I took
away a new picture of how college
music works. « '

Let me start with the bands. CMJ
detractors attack the fact that badge
holders have a hard time getting into
some shows. I say, "Who cares?"
CM] is there to showcase bands
you'll never see in Pittsburgh or any
of the other godforsaken college
towns that don't get a lot of shows.
Big-name former indies like the
Archers of Loaf, Sebadoh, and
Spiritualized, as well as legends like
Patti Smith, played and sold out
quickly, but hey, so what? I ‘took a

' friend's advice and went to see the

bands I'd never see anywhere_else and
was never turned away. And guess
where the real indie label reps were?
Checking out the lesser-known pop
acts like Moped and Tinsel at Coney
Island High, chilling in the Alterknits
room at the Knitting Factory, watch-
ing Tullycraft. Seeing the newer
bands they wouldn't get to see else-

»where. Other bands that rocked?

Modest Mouse (Up records),
Kittywinder (Zero Hour), Pest.5000

The College Music Journal Music
Marathon amasses probably the largest
number of sparkling, geeky, indie
rockers you'd ever imagine in one
place. I was a registered participant for
the last two years (one of the millions),
but just a humble observer on the out-
side for this year's affair. With a certain
amount of distance from the con_ven-
tion clique, my understanding of the
Music Marathon's role in indie rock
culture has grown.

First off, the nature of independent
rock is D.I.Y. — do it yourself. Like
any subculture, consumption is a fore-
most concern. So, if ..the big -money

, corporate music machine is avoided,

kids can determine what they will be
listening to, what they'll read, and what
they'll wear instead of clueless fat busi-
nessmen whose main concern is prof-
its. This is the watered down indie
ethos; it makes sense to me, and
explains why I became a part of the
community. CMJ, the magazine and
the marathon, provides an invaluable
opportunity for Joe Indie-Rocker to
meet face-to-face with his peers and
network, to expand horizons, to dis-

tribute information/music, etc. .

(Consult Sean Stevens‘ article for an
illustration.) However, times -have
changed since the mid/late '80s when I
first discovered the indie alternative —
mass culture has caught up with indie-
rock and assimilated it into popular
culture. .

There are countless examples of
this assimilation, far too many to list.
In the specific realm of the CMJ Music

Marathon, the barrage was unavoid—.

able. Every registered participant
receives a care package filled with a
list of events, club locations, and a
map. Aside from these practical items,
the majority of the packet is major-
label CD samplers, and a small library
of big—time music mags (Rolling
Stone, Gavin, Spin, etc.). Likewise, the
long stretch of information booths are
comprised of corporate organizations
who have adopted that "indie" look in
an attempt to get you to sign up for
some radio program they're pushing or

Last Man Standing

Directed by: Walter Hill

Starring: Bruce Willis, Bruce Dem,
Christopher Walken

The heydays of gangster films
were the post—prohibition era and the
post—World War II era. The films that
were made in those periods actually
depicted the real-life gangsters of the
day. Because of the government trying
to get a tighter grip on society, every-
thing went underground, giving the
gangster a whole world of opportuni-
ties to make a living.

At the same time, a new type of
novel sprang forth. This dime or
"pulp" novel was created out of the
same circumstances. The stories dealt
with gangsters or other criminals, con-
tained quick, snappy sentences and
dialogue, and were very popular. Jim
Thompson and David Goodis had as
their protagonists the criminals (the
"bad guys"), not the police (the "good
guys").

Though Last Man Standing is a
remake _of the Japanese film Yojimbo,
it lives within these two counter-soci-
ety worlds that are purely American. .

Set during prohibition, Last Man is
about a criminal (Willis) who is run-
ning away to Mexico. Along the way,
he takes up every opportunity to make
as much money as possible. His search
leads him, by chance, to Jericho, a

Bruce Willis in yet another sensitive, Mr. Nice-guy role.

_ small Texas town along the route of a

major booze—smuggling trail.

Jericho is inhabited by two gangs.
One, an Irish gang, is led by, a man
named Doyle (David Patrick Kelly).
The other, a mafia extension, is led by
a man named Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg).
All of the "decent folk" have been run
out of town ' while these two gangs
fight ‘over the territory. One of the
locals tells Willis‘ character, known as
John Smith, the only thing he'll find in

Jericho other than gangs is '"el muerte" I

(death). Indeed, the first shop he spies

is the undertaker's, complete with a
body already in the window.

As soon as Smith arrives in
Jericho, he runs into trouble with one
of the gangs. In the process of getting
out of this initial trouble, he falls deep-
er and deeper, thinking about getting
rich the entire time. He ends up work-
ing for both gangs, turning them
against each other. People are double-
crossed, people are killed, and bullets
are wasted, all for the lure of "easy"
money. V

em genre, tries to take the gangster out
of the city, placing him deep in the
heart of Texas. ‘He does not succeed,
however; only in a place that has laws
established can laws be broken.

Bruce Willis gives an excellent
performance as the major lawbreaker.
He has a quick, but non-cliché dia-
logue, and an overall tough look about
him. He is admittedly conscience-less,
like the characters in the popular dime

novels and the only "chink in his’

armor" is what trips him up.
Christopher Walken's character,
Hickey, Doyle's assassin, could easily
have been played over—the—top, but
Walken reels it in. Michael Imperioli
(of Spike Lee and Scorsese fame) does
a great job as a "junior" mafioso. His is
a great character that calls back images
of the early prohibition—era gangster
representations.

Composer Ry Cooder is to Walter
Hill what. John Williams is to
Spielberg. The score is a wonderful
biting companion to the dry desert
images of Jericho and its surroundings.

The prohibition gangster and crim-
inal have recently been revived criti-
cally and now theatrically. Last Man is
a smart, entertaining film that creates a
link between the lone-wolf hero image
of the°'80s and '90s and the gangsters
(antiheroes) of the '30s and '40s.

thanks to Yellow Cab company, I got
to see four good bands a night, while
other people sat through hours of
lines and crap openers to see a big-
name headliner, or worse, were turned
away after standing in line for an
hour

I guess I really shouldn't say I
never stood in one of those lines,
though. I waited about 45 minutes to
see Modest Mouse in the ironically-
named, warmest club on Earth, the
Cooler. I couldn't keep quiet forever,
so I struck up some conversations
with members of other bands I'd seen,
and with people from other stations.
Having already seen the small indie
bands in small venues it was no prob-

THE PI'l"l' NEWS

lem to start up a conversation, plug-
ging our live on—air show, or even just
talking music. I found out inside dirt
on Wesley Willis ("easier than work-
ing with a junkie, when you never
know what you're going to get") while
standing in line. Likewise, a little
bullshitting with other station types
—- in cabs, in lines —— hepped me to
new ideas for training new DJs, man-
aging theft, and dealing with music
reviews. All this, just from standing in

smaller lines, at smaller clubs, where’

the -bands haven't already sneaked
through the VIP line.

So now I guess it's on to the free
beer. My first night at CMJ was spent
on the roof of an apartment building

in Union Square, drinking Rolling
Rock given to me by a record rep.
Indie sleaze? Not really, considering
Chuck of Want Adds distribution and
No Life records has never offered me
so much as a good—boy lollipop for
charting his records and never will. I
got to meet him in person, as well as
some other label types you won't care
about but who turned out to be really
cool. They didn't push records, they
were human beings with us.
Theoretically, getting to know people
shouldn't make any difference in how
you respond to the music they push,
but it does.

In fact, those private smal1—labe1
parties may have been the most dan-

gerous forms of record label inﬂu-
ence. Because in the DIY world of
college radio (see Jesse Trbo's arti-
cle), knowing the man in the garage
or basement who mails the records is
more important thanhaving a glossy
poster on your wall. It's more valuable
to the reps, /too, because their name,
and more importantly, their music, is
all they have to offer us. Their parties
were about people. The majors‘ par-
ties, most notably Capito1's Pukefest,
were about free beer and free shit (or
was that free shit beer — never, ever
drink "Wit Beer”!) and not meeting
the real people behind the music.

In a sea of message‘ slips, I'll call
the people I know are good first, no
matter how many posters or extra
copies of CDs Joe Blow at Epic sends
me.

Is there really a lot of that sort of
thing at CMJ? Unfortunately, yes.
Reps buy CMJ registrations to the
tune of $170, dinners, cabs, you name
it. And yes, I took some of those free
cabs. But there's a difference between
a free cab and a free cab with a
record-push string attached. A promo-
tions panel moderator ended his
speech by reading the Webster's defi-
nition for payola, then took Clemson's
musicdirector to a free lunch. She
tried to pay, but he said he had the
check — if she'd chart his next record.

But as much of that ooze that per-
vaded CMJ, there ‘was just as much
good, especially on the panels. Friday
is College Radio Day, and panelists
from bands, labels, intemet firms, and
promo companies were all there to
answer questions. I went to the promo
panel just to meet Josh Kazooass from
Epitaph, figuring the topic would be a
waste of my time. After three months
of listening to promo people on the
phone, I figured I'd heard it all. But I
was shocked to hear it was OK to pass
on a record. My predecessor had told
me it was best to just lie to avoid get-
ting dropped and get them out of your
hair, but these guys said that a real
dialogue, complete with "Leave me
alone, we hate your record" phone
calls was what they wanted.

If you think about it, it makes
sense. How can they know about us if
we don't talk? And that's really what
CMJ is all about — talking to people
face to face, building a network of
contacts that ﬂows both ways to keep
college radio alive. Otherwise both
radio and the industry are talking to
themselves. CMJ, if it's done right,
will keep college radio alive and can
make a station better.

But you probably still won't get to
have sex with someone who likes
Stereolab.

The question now arises: is it OK
to accept the corporate junk or is doing
so corrupting the indie community and
furthering the assimilation process‘?
Example: by accepting a stack of CDs
from the majors, Joe Indie can proba-
bly sell them to a used CD store for
four bucks adisk, thus taking the cor—
porate rock world to the bank accom-
panied by lewd hand gestures. Or per-
haps Joe Indie is just another link in the
distribution process of the major label
and is therefore propagating a watered-
down version of "his" music for some
sucker to buy. Another interesting

discussions of indie issues? Should he
just assert the assimilated indie look
that companies are trying  sell to

This paradox will always exist. I
personally feel that indie rock is at its
apex as far as pop culture marketability
goes. Just as the face of indie rock is
changing and will only faintly resem-
ble the faux corporate—indie parody,
pop culture will be force—fed so1ne new
gimmick. Big industry will always try
to get its hands in what it perceives to
be hip new trends, but here's hoping the
kids stay one step ahead of it.

Every September, thousands of col-
lege radio staff, DJs, newspaper and
magazine writers, music industry reps,
and other vultures descend on New York
City for the CMJ (College Music
Journal) Music Marathon.

I rose, bleary eyed, before dawn on
Wednesday, Sept. 4, to meet those faith-
ful servants of WPTS who would be my
companions on the trip to New York. I
was twenty minutes late for our 6 a.m.
meeting time and freaked that they'd
leave without me. My fears were
unfounded, however, seeing as Mr.
Trbovich was still sound asleep when I
reached the rendezvous point.

Anyway, we made it to the Big
Apple without incident. Wednesday

Ugly Kids and other to

 

night I caught the magnificent Steven
Merrit, a.k.a Magnetic Fields, at the
Simple Machines showcase. This man is
so truly introverted that he really should-
n't be appearing in front of live people,
but every single living body packed into
the Cooler was very appreciative of his
efforts. It's really great when you get to
witness the process of a person facing
real demons in front of you, and then, if
not conquering those demons, at least
making some great an out of the struggle.

The keynote address for CMJ this
year was Patti Smith. At 11 a.m.
Thursday, she looked about as wide
awake and prepared for the new day as I
was. She came onstage wearing shades,
which she jokingly referred as her "only

chance to look cool up here," before
removing them to read her notecards.

I have a whole lot of respect for Patti
Smith, which is why I made sure not to
miss her speech. She, along with other
writer/musicians like Richard Hell, were
among those so—called New York "liter-
ate punks" in the '70s who really forged
the whole scene before it was called
PUNK ROCK.

Patti's speech was concerned mainly
with the fact that rock 'n roll is in serious

trouble. She pointed the finger not at "the '

industry" per se, but at each and every
person involved in the rock world,
including her entire audience. She didn't
hold back at all, yet she didn't come
across as being condescending or repri-

manding. She referred to herself as "a
benevolent thorn in the side of the entire
process," and urged artists never to com-
promise their vision and to always be
true to themselves. This stuff might
sound a bit droll but, considering the sad
state of rock, these were welcome words
indeed.

Patti is regarded by many as being
especially important because she's a
woman, but don't expect her to see her
define herself by gender. Hell, she
always used to say that if she could be
anyone who ever lived, it would be
Rimbaud. When asked by a young
woman, during the Q&A session that fol-
lowed her speech, which of the "new girl
bands" that Patti liked in particular, she
responded by saying that she doesn't’
draw a distinction between male and
female music.

"I like music made by human
beings," she said, in the first of what were
to be a string of unintentionally unsatis-
factory (for those asking the questions)
responses. Some guy who called himself
"Lord Duke" from some band called
Total Sexual Freedom said he felt his
band had been discriminated against in
the "business" because some of them
were African Americans. She ﬁrst went
into an AIDS diatribe, sparked by the
band name, and then questioned the guy's
motives in trying to "break into the busi-
ness." -

"If you are happy with your art, find
other people around you who like it too,
don't be so concerned with getting rich,
because it hardly ever happens," was her
message. ,

CMJ was, for me, pretty helpful. The
panels were kind of like class; I didn't so
much learn something new, but rather,
was forced to think about and discuss
things that I might not ordinarily think
about.

I got to see Johnny Cash Saturday
night, and despite what Stevens says
about waiting in lines, the Man in Black
was deﬁnitely worth the wait. He played
a Beck song and a Soundgarden song.

great example of the beauty "of CM]:

It was Thursday night, and although
I had’ just returned from seeing my man
R.L. Burnside tear up a rockin' blues set
(for the second time in three months—I
truly felt blessedi), I was still pretty
bummed about having missed
Spiritualized for the second time in two
days (see last week's spectrum to find
out why I missed them the first time).
Though my companions were all ready
to crash, I myself was not ready for
Dreamland. The lights in our room were
shut off, so I sat out in the hallway of the
Radisson in order to read some of the
free magazines I had received earlier that
day.

The elevator doors opened and three
rowdy, drunken young CMJ-types came
stumbling out. Theylaughed when they
saw me.

"Look, man, a straggler!" said the
one in front.

I chuckled, thinking, ” What a bunch
of assholes... ”

"What's up, man? How's it goin'?"
asked the second guy.

At this point I hadn't hob—nobbed (or
even spoken) with anyone in NY, and
these three guys, bumping into each
other as they searched for the correct
hotel room door, looked friendly enough,
so I responded, "I'm doin' alright, how
‘bout yourself?" _

"I found it, man — this is our room!"
said Drunk Dude #1, before turning back

- to me; "Hey, man, you wanna smoke

one?" -

Being a journalist, naturally I was
curious. "Sure."

I stood up, and began to follow them

into their room.

As I entered, I noticed guitar cases

" laying around, as well as a tray full of

hours—old room service food.
Dude #1 picked a hotel bill up off

; the ﬂoor. "Man, they have my name on

I expect me to pay for all this shit, man!

That's $750, man!"
Dude #2 soothed him. "Don't worry,

. By this point, I knew that my new-
found hosts were some Very Important
People indeed, not just your average col-
lege-rocker-types at all. Two of them
descended on the skanky room service
food, while the other one began rolling a
joint.

"So, who do you guys play with?" I
asked.

"Ompla kon jah," said Dude #2,
through a mouthful of club sandwich.

"What band?" I asked.

"Ugly Kid Joe, dude!" responded
Dude #1, as he cracked open a Heineken.

It was pretty late, and I had been
drinking earlier myself, so I wasn't sure if
I heard him correctly. Was I really sitting

here bullshitting with Ugly Kid Joe,
(hopefully) the last of "the goofy funny-
metal-funk bands (not counting the
reigning kings of ugly-shit music, the
Chili Peppers) that were put to rest when
Nirvana put "grunge" on the map in the
early '90s? This was unbelievable!

We sat around for about an hour,
drinking, smoking, and philosophizing
about the origins of the human
race.(Dude #1 believes that it had some-
thing to do with space aliens and some
vague molecular "lifeforce.")

They.were pretty sensitive about the
fact that they got dropped from their
record company last year, after the fol-
low—up to their hit debut album ﬂopped.
They said things like, "We used to be

they won't touch us! If MTV doesn't play
you, then you're nothing, man! We got
pigeonholed with all these bands like
Winger and Warrant, man! It's not fair!"
It's funny how they didn't realize the fact
that they were merely pawns, who bene-
ﬁtted from the same machine they were
now criticizing. I kind of felt bad for
them.

Basically, these guys were pretty
much how I would have expected them
to be. They were nice guys, sort of Bill
and Ted-esque, but not quite as dumb as
you might think. '

I got an advance copy of their new
CD ("Dude, get this, it's called Motel
California, dude!"), and had to sit
through the whole thing with them, too. I
didn't want to lie to them, so I had to

make vague complimentary-type com-
ments such as, "Hmmrn, this really
sounds a lot dzﬁerent than the other one!"
and "Wow, the production on this thing is
pretty smooth, man."

The whole experience was pretty
valuable to me as a music lover because
it forced me to think about this whole
issue of music fandom, and how person-
ally music lovers like myself take the
music that we listen to; how we "hate"
bands that suck, and sometimes might
even imagine that we'd like them to die
horrible deaths, etc...

But when faced with the actual
human beings who create that music
(even if it is throwaway trash like Ugly
Kid Joe's Motel Caltfomia), it's not so
simple. There are bands who I respect,
but whose music I don't necessarily get
into, and half the bands I love might be
total assholes if I met them. Then there
are bands who seem to embody every-
thing that I hate about the pasteurized
rock 'n roll money mill, like Ugly Kid
Joe, and they turn out to be decent guys
who share their beer with me, without
giving a shit whether I write for some
college paper or not.

I didn't mean to turn this thing into
some Rick Nowlin-type personal essay
or anything. The "UKJ" (as they referred
to themselves) experience was really
thought-provoking, and I think that it
reﬂects the essence of CM].

Some years ago, a small spaceship
crash—landed in Alabama. On board were
three teenage extraterrestrials who came to
conquer our Earth with their sounds from
space and beyond. As the story goes, they

' formed a space punk band and joined up with

Estrus records for their ﬁrst long—player, Is it
Man  or A.st70man?. After hearing this
record, I was under their power. It is a great
record ﬁlled with sci—ﬁ samples and some of
the rockinest surf/space/spy tunes known to
man

Now, after 22 singles, ﬁve LPs (includ-

    

The great white pizza. Created from
outrageous quantities of ricotta, mozzarella,

provolone and parmesan cheeses, plus garlic
and spice, topped with fresh tomato slices.

cake. In "Evil Plans of Planet Spectra," they
let us in on their plot to subdue us with their
rock and rule our Earth.

On this album there are three tracks with
vocals, possibly an all—time high for Man  or
Astroman. The ﬁrst is a mediocre track called
"9 Volt." The second is a great song titled
"Anoxia." It is a slower song chock—full of
reverb, almost in a "Theme from Endless
Summer" fashion. It also features some bare-
ly audible — at least with our inferior earth-
ling ears —vocals and anice minute of feed-
back and space noise. "Television Man" is a
straight pop song with the expected Man  or
Astroman guitar sound. '

A couple of weeks ago, Man  or
Astroman stopped by our measly town for a

ing a very entertaining live record on One
Louder records out of England), and more
compilation tracks then you can shake a stick
at, Man  or Astroman have released
Experiment Zero, their second for Touch and
Go Records. As with Deluxe Men in Space,
their last Touch and Go release, this one is
also recorded with Steve Albini.

The album starts oil" with "Stereo Phase
Tes " which is done in the style of the old
stereo demonstration records. "Television
Fission" comes after the speaker test, with
drums and guitars kicking loud enough to
shake the planet.

The fourth track, "Planet Collision," con-
tains some of the sci—ﬁ style sampling that
puts the icing on the Man  or Astroman

show at the Graﬂiti. They brought all the
usual gear: televisions, sci—ﬁ movies, and lots
of wires and general mess. They put on a
good show, despite being obviously upset
about the oVer—2l age requirement and gen-
eral greed of the Grafﬁti. However, this time
they brought a new toy on tour and ended

their set with quite an electrical display.

Basically, if you have heard Man  or
Astroman before, then you love them. “With
names like Starcrunch, Coco the Electric
Monkey Wizard, and Dexter X Man From

never heard them, try to. You will fall under
