By NAT MARY'N

V The University will open a
free parking lot tomorrow
which will accommodate over
300 cars. ’

’ The lot is located at Alli-
quippa and Darraugh Sts.

across from the ﬁeld house, and
will be open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The information was revealed
Monday by Lt. Charles Ray of the
University Police.‘ “I hope that
many students will take advan-
tage of this parking area” he said.

Students have been parking in
this area already, and many are
expected to use the new lot.

The lot is an open one and there
is no attendent. Students, faculty
and other members of the Univer-
sity family may use it. No permit
is required.

The lot was formerly a football
ﬁeld and can accommodate as
many as 500 cars.

Lt. Ray warns those who will
park there to lock their cars.
“We would like to have someone,
on guard there but it is not feas-
ible at this time. People who
parkthere will do so at their
own risk. To be safe they should
lock all doors and not leave
anything visible in the car.” he
added.

He also hopes that opening the
lot will ease the parking situation
near the Cathedral.

SC To Ask
For Change
Of Tap Date

Student Congress voted at
Monday’s meeting to recom-
mend to the Student Affairs
Calendar Committee chang-
ing the Tap Day date so as
not on conflict with Spring
Festival Week.

It was the consensus that Tap
Day ceremonies were of a sober
nature and thereby conflicted with
the light atmosphere of Festival.

Spring Festival Chairman,
Helen Tishon, Ed. ’58, made note
that the traditional Sweepstakes
race may be either replaced by a
special event or that the Inter-
fraternity Council will assume re-
sponsibility for running it.

To defray the $459 expenses
of the Pitt Chest campaign,
Men's Council representative
Larry Fiedler, Col. ’58 success-
fully moved SC to allocate up to
$250.

Stassen Gives Views
On Primary, Election

An Exclusive PITT NEWS Interview
By MILLARD AMDUR t-

Harold Stassen spoke against Republican State Chairman
Bloom in an interview on the way from the airport to a cam-

paign meeting downtown this

“He (Bloom) selected a group of 28 to meet and that 28

then slated my opposition , I

od.” He stated his view, later expanded in his talk to Pitt
students, ,_that he was for openO-

primaries and open conventions.
Stassen asserted that he planned
to re-examine the distribution of
party funds in Pennsylvania and
rules under which they were dis-
tributed. ‘ 

Stassen claims to be in the
process of setting up “67 county
organizations.” A meeting of six
of these was held over the
weekend, in Pittsburgh.

Stassen claims that the “oppo-
sition” to him in his party gen-
erally’ concedes that he would
have strong support in the gen-
eral election. He stipulated that
he felt particularly able to gain
support of union workers, min-
ers, building trades, and inde-
pendents.

The “adverse dip” in the
economy he blamed on the weak
state administration which fail-
ed to build up business and pub-
lic works in the state. He noted
the:$l00,000,000 in unused fed-
eral appropriations for public-
works in the state of Pennsyl-
vania. _ '

’ Pennsylvania has a dispropor-
tionate share of the unemployed
in the United States due to the
“inefﬁcient, over-lapping govern-
mental structure.” '

He has decided to campaign on
a four-point program which he

.di.scussed at length in interview

and student talk.

Expansion of manufacturing
and industry is necessary to oﬁ-
set slips during the past ten
years. He attributed this trend
to hightaxes and unnecessary
regulations. "

He pledged that he would take
advantage of the lessons to be
learned from “upsurging Califor-
nia and Ohio” in luring new in-
dustry and thus increasing the
payroll and decreasing unemploy-
ment. '

Point two on his program is
broader educational opportunity
in the state for everyone and in

rest opportunity for the youth of

  

past weekend.

particular the gifted science stu-

He proposed formation of seven
geographically—located s c h o o l s
with special scientiﬁc facilities.
Students without any scholastic
potential, Stassen proposes to re-
lease from school on a full-time
basis. He would allow them to
work.part—time, to release them
from the explosive situation.”

Stassen approves expansion of
state-scholarship programs with
funds allotted to individual col-
leges and universities. These
funds would be awarded to stu-
dents, who would have “a moral»
obligation” to repay the scholar-
ship aid when able.

In this way, he provides “great-

the state,” and takes the burden
off the middle income family.

The last two points in his plat-
form are to streamline and ‘re-
model the governmental structure,
in Harrisburg and to exercise
“keystone leadership” in national
and international affairs.

Stassen wants revision of Penn-
sylvania Constitution (1874).

He conceded the Democratic
primary to Mayor “David Lawr-
ence stating: “My impression is
that he has been an able Mayor of
Pittsburgh and will be a formid-
able candidate——whom I believe. I

It is possible that Men’s
Conference may become a
course that is accredited by"
the University.

Gerald Lesher, Bus. Ad. ’59,
Chairman of the Men’s Con-
ference program told vMen’s Coun-
cil last Friday that there is a
movement underway to make the
non-credit, one hour per week
course into an accredited course.

Council then established a
study committee to work with a
graduate assistant in the Dean
of Men’s Office to study the
feasibility of such a plan. The
study will probably take two
years. If the course is accred-
ited it may be run by the Uni-
versity rather than Men’s Coun-
oil as it is now.

Edward Nemeth, Eng. ’60, was
elected to Men’s .Court to fill a va-
cancy as Justice on the tribunal.
His election is only to‘ fill out the
unexpired portion of; the current
term. , .

A ﬁnal Report on the Men’s
Council Confab to be held tomor-
row evening was given by Lee
Thompson, Col. ’60, Social Chair-
man. The confab will consist of
“brainstorming” sessions and dis-
cussions to evaluate Council and
improve it in the next year.

Thompson also reported that
arrangements are being made to
have the ﬁnal banquet of Coun-
cil Apr. 16. At that time the new
oﬁicers of the group will be in-

- stalled.

  FOR BETTER oR FOR WORSE’

The first thought that comes into our minds upon entering
college ‘is, of course, marriage. But how many of us go about
seeking mates, as I like to call them,'in a truly scientiﬁc manner?

So let us today make a scientiﬁc survey of  two principal
causes of 'marriage—personality need and ‘propiuquity.

Personality need means that we choose mates because they
possess certain-qualities that complete and fulﬁll our own per-
sonalities. Take, for example, the case -of Alanson Duck.

As a freshman Alanson made a fine scholastic record, played
varsity scrabble, and was president of his class. One would ,, ;
think that Alanson was a totally fulﬁlled man. But he was not. ~ 4 A
There was something lacking in his life, something vague and

, indeﬁnable that was needed to make his personality complete.

Then one day Alanson discovered what it was. As he was
walking out of his class in Flemish pottery, a fetching coed
named Grace Ek offered him a handsome red and white

pack

“Yes!” he cried, for all at once he knew what he had been
needing to round out his personality-the hearty fulﬁllment of
Marlboro Cigarettes, the soul-repairing mildness of their line
tobacco, the easy draw of their unparalleled filter, the ease and
convenience of their crushproof ﬂip-top box. “Yes, I will take a
Marlboro!” cried Alanson. “And I will also take you to wife

“La!” she exclaimed, throwing her apron over her face. But
after a while she removed it and they were married. Today
they live happily in Baffin Land where Alanson is with an
otter—glazing ﬁrm and Grace is a bookie.

Propinquity, the second principal cause’ of marriage, simply
means closeness. Put a boy and a girl close together for a sus-
tained period of time and their proximity will certainly ripen
into love and their love into marriage. A perfect example is

While a freshman at Louisiana State University, Fafnir was
required to crawl through the Big Inch pipeline as part of his
fraternity initiation. He entered the pipe at Baton Rouge and,
alone and joyless, he proceeded to crawl north.

As he passed Lafayette, Indiana, he was agreeably surprised
to be joined by a comely girl named Mary Alice Isinglass, a
Purdue freshman, who, oddly enough, had to crawl through
the Big Inch as part of her sorority initiation. ‘

  

After a good hot bath they were married and today they live.
in Klamath Falls, Oregon, where Fafnir is in the weights and
measures department and Mary Alice is in the rooﬁng game.
They have three children, all named Norman. o 1958, Max Shulmnl

Letters To The Editor

From time to time almost every newspaper reader takes
objection to something he has read. He then uses a privilege
given him by the newspaper, that of writing and submitting
for publication a letter to the editor. _ A

That this is a right given by the paper is indisputable as
the only thing that is permitted in print is what the editor
has approved. '

But no editor can cut himself off from this criticism
Without suffering direct obstruction to his own growth as
a result. He needs the controversy to maintain new ideas
and an ever broadening viewpoint.

It has never been the policy of this paper_or any right-
thinking paper to withhold a letter from print in order to
protect the editor. Toomuch time and personal sacriﬁce has

‘gone into the building of this paper during its 53’years pro-

duction for any individual to think himself more important
than the paper.

A newspaper represents a point of view» which _is in-
formed and—through constant ef’fort—objective. It has a
duty to reﬁect public opinion and to inform the public.
These two roles are often divergent and sometimes conﬂict-

ing for space. In this case it is popularly held that the role -A

of public information is more important.
Reader’s ,letters are vital to th’e growth of the paper in

.- its given role. They act as a safeguard against error, inac-

curacy and irresponsibility, All of which are great sins
which plague the best of newspapers.

' No editor will ever suppress thevoice of the people that
he is representing. This effort would be suicidal.

The only limitations placed on letters are the same as
those dictated by principles of newspaper production. That
is brevity, timeliness and space availability. Any one of
these can make it impossible to print a letter.-

There will always be a place in this paper (space will-
ing) for the opinions of its readers.

There is no place in this paper or the minds of the read-
ing public for those who haven’t got the guts to criticize
publicly.

Collegiate Press Clippings

By Gordon Clowney

Thefollowing items gathered from the Associat-

ed Collegiate Press may prove of interest, while at
the same time giving an insight into the happenings
in other colleges and universities throughout the
country.
_ Four Kappa Sigs at Southern
Methodist University have a
hearse for sale. Last November
theyibought’ the 1948 black Cad-
illac hearse for $200 because
they wanted a “different” mode
of transportation. They ﬁrst
thought about getting a ﬁre
engine but found the prices too
blazing high, according to the
SMU Campus.

Now in debt, the four are
willing to sell for $150. They say
the hearse is in perfect condition and will carry 12
passengers. Coeds have refused to ride in it. how-
ever, they said, despite the tasteful midnight blue
interior decorations.

“Fraternity parties are great, girls worry too
much about getting fat, and university students are
often apathetic concerning government and poli-
tics.” So ran the summation of American college
life by one Honduran student, Joseiweizenblot, a
business administration senior at University ‘of
Connecticut.

No Eoliﬁcal lnferesf

In an interview in the Connecticut Daily
Campus, Weizenblot expanded on his ideas about
the American student’s lack of concern over poli-
tical affairs.

He blames it in part on the isolation of the
campus: the American college is an entire com-
munity with newspaper, shopping district, religious
and cultural elements and so many other things the

 

student can simply exist in this separate world
and ignore what surrounds it.

“Apart from speciﬁc organizations within the
university, students fail to follow world affairs.”
He called the student senate a bunch of children
playing at toys, making trivia into major issues,
getting nowhere when they discuss.”

 

“In the event they do not decide upon a major .

issue” it makes little difference because “they have
so little authority they probably would be unable
to carry out their plan.”

He contrasted this with the position of univers-
ity students in Honduras. “There students have the
dual role of acquiring a profession and also of pre-
paring themselves for future leadership of their
country.

“They are active in their civic role and are re-
garded as an important political factor in their

country and therefore play a deﬁnite role in the'

political life of the nation.”
A surprise trip to Hawaii was “awarded" Occi-

dental College freshman class president Bill Paden:

during hazing at the Los Angeles school. Reported
the Occidental, 50 sophomores kidnapped - the

freshman leader as he left a class, told him hehad:

a one—way ticket to Honolulu and put him on a
plane with a stack of literature on Hawaii. The
airlines made him their guest (for two hours) on
the Islands ,then put him on a plane for home.
Dung Ho _

Board of Control members at South Dakota
State College, Brookings, S.D., were worrying
about how to keep campus paywalkers off the
grass. ‘‘Let’s have snow .fences across those paths
all year long,” expounded Dave Christensen, stu-
dent president, according to the Collegian. -

“Better still,” muttered another board member,‘

“let’s‘pi1e manure along the edge of the sidewzxlks.
That’ll keep ’em in line.”

Letters To The Editor

PADDLING PROBLEMS
Murray Chass, The Pitt News

You are young and innocent, it
plainly is seen, Are you, by any
chance, an Education Major? It
sounds as though you have been
reading some of the “pat” state-
ments taught children for some
time. ‘ _ '

Although I agree with you on
the paddling subject, I think
you will ﬁnd that the solution to
the problem is not putting itin
the parents’ hands, for most dis-
ciplining problems originate be-
cause Johnny is always right in
his parents’ eeys, and the school
is always wrong. _ Hoping you
will enjoy the classroom profes-
sion as much as I do.
J Education 51

*Murray Chass, The Pitt News

I have taught in the public
schools for several years. As a
teacher, I was not aware of the
sadistic impulses “obviously” ap-
parent in my fellow co-workers
and myself. Neither was I aware
of such “teacher releases” when
I was a student in the public
schools.

Deﬁnitely, the paddle does not
bring respect for the teacher.
This respect, that we demand,
because of our “many insecuri-
ties,” should have been instilled
in the child at the time or short-
ly after reaching school age.

A call to arparent who has not
made his child aware of “teacher
demands” would be rather futile.
-I doubt the teacher paddles in
preference to forfeiting an hour
of her school‘, time. Most school
systems have time set aside for
disciplinary measures.

Few accomplishments are real-
ized when a parent (mother) is
called, dad is told of the situa-
tion at the conclusion of‘ his
third “trick” at the plant or his

'weekly bowling event. Johnny ,

(the persecuted) has long been
in bed. The next afternoon when
Johnny arrives home from
— school, he is punished some
twenty-four hours after commit-
ting his crime. Johnny had for-

-gotten this misdemeanor of » yes- ;

terday, and may have committed
a new -today.

 

You will note that I disregard
the idea of mother punishing her
son. I'm sure Johnny is'quite a
sizeable fellow to have lived
through the brutalities imposed
by his teachers.

Abandon your newspaper
career. Pursue the “Street of
Sadism” in education. When
you’ve become a teacher, I'm
sure you’ll trade in your-“yellow
journalism Underwood” for a
sturdy board and a book about
“How To Administer Rabbit
Punches in the Classroom.”

Editor, The Pitt News

The Pitt News hasjumped the
gun in its‘ editorial “Public
Spirited Citizens.”

They state the Allied Colleg-
iate Party “has not found it nec-
essary to extrovert themselves

on any one topic.” Two days be- _

fore the editorial it was an-
nounc in the News that two
parties were being formed.
Neither party at that time listed
faculty advisers, party platforms
or proposed candidates.

Only 48 hours later, the News
claims the Allied Collegiate
Party is shying away from tak-
ing part in the election. They
say we are “keeping quiet.” This
is nonsense!

We further question that
bringing Harold Stassen to Pitt
is “garphic proof” that the
United Independent program as
a whole is either “dynamic or
worthwhile.” This event is to be
praised but in no way indicates

"that they have assumed a sense

of “p o l i ti c a l responsibility.”
What programs have they pro-
posed that have given them “the
initiative in the political race.”
None! The initiative has been
taken toward city wide publicity,
but nothing in the form of con-

crete, deﬁnite party platform on

which to stand.

STUDENTS AND
FACULTY

Editor, The Pitt News

The editorial in -the Feb. 27
Pitt News issue entitled “Stu-
dents And Faculty” came as _a
surprise to the Pitt YMCA and
YWCA members. The editorial
stated that the student-faculty
discussion groups are “compara-
tively new and ‘vital part of our
Univ'ersity"s ‘extra—c 1 a s s r 0 om
program” and “Greek Week
Committee very admirably has

set aside an eevning for stu-

dent-zfacul-ty discussions.”

This _Is NOTHING NEW ON

"THE Pitt CAMPUS. Just asua

point of information, the Pitt
YMCA and YWCA have been
sponsoring such a project with?
success for the past three years.
Last year we had 15 student-
faculty discussion groups in
various parts of Pittsburgh, and
this year we have 10 such
groups. The Pitt News had two
articles describing these groups,
one in the Mar. 14, 1957, issue
using Professor Virgil Cant.ini’s
group as an exabple, and in the
Dec. 18, 1957, issue using Dr.
Raymond Brittain’s group as an
example.

The purpose of these groups
has been to provide a meeting
ground between students and the
faculty outside the classroom in
an informal atmosphere and to
intellec-
tual horizon. This is precisely
what the groups have been do-
mg. ' '

As for the statment, "The fac-
ulty members must take the time
(unreimbursed time),” we can
answer" that they have ‘given
their time in the past and are
giving it now. We could not ask
for more cooperation from them.

, By JIM LACEY
The Eastern Intercollegite Wrestling Association Cham-
pionships will be on tap Friday and Saturday at the Field
House. Sessions will start at 1 pm. and 8 pm. both days. The

tournament is the oldest one
in 1906.

in the country starting back

Early Tournaments were held with four teams and the

number of competing teams in-6

creased until the present 16 team
ﬁeld. The Panthers were one of
the last entrants, entering in 1954.

The Blue and Gold have domi-
nated the tournament since they
were admitted. They took the
team championship three years in
a row before Penn State upset
them last year. Even then they
finished. second with Ed Peery,
Dave Johnson, and Ron Schirf
capturing titles.

Lightweights Important

Of the three winners from last
year, only Johnson remains in an
attempt to take his third Eastern
title. .

“This year’s tournament could .
be decided by the results of the
123, 130, 137, and 147 pound
classes,” states Coach Rex
Peery, “because all five powers
have top wrestlers in these
classes."

The powers in this year’s tour-
ney will be Lehigh, Cornell, Syra-
cuse, Penn State and the Panthers.
The Nittany Lions are late comers
to the group, but have to be added
on the strength of their 14-11 up-
set win over the Blue and Gold.

Auble Favored at 137

Eleven other teams are entered
in the tournament but none of
them will be given much of a
chance to upset the favorites.
Among the other entries are:
Army, Franklin and Marshall,
Navy, Rutgers and Temple. Ivy
League schools entered in the
tourney include Brown, Columbia,
Penn, Princeton, and Yale.

The 123 pound class has four
outstanding wrestlers, all from
the favored teams. Panther Paul
Powell, sensational sophomore
with a 10-0-1 record, will give
the favored Dick Auble of Cor-
Auble decisioned
Powell at the Wilkes Tourna;
ment by an 8-3 count.

Other top entrants in the 123
pound class are Ed Carlin, of Syra-
cuse, Robert Myers of Lehigh and
GeorgeaEl1is of Army.

Gratto Returns

Johnny Johnston of Penn State
reigns as the 130 pound class king.
Four men are ready and waiting
if he falters. Sherm Moyer of the
Blue and Gold, Leon Harbold of
Lehigh, Carmen Molino of Cornell,
and George Creason of Syracuse
are all waiting to challenge John-
ston. Robert Green of Navy and
Jerry Weisensell of Army will also
compete in this weight class.

Joe Gratto was the 137 pound
champ in his sophomore year,
but John Pepe of Penn State
edged him in the Easterns last
year. Gratto took the National
title by beating Pepe. Pepe has
since graduated thereby making
Gratto a heavy favorite to take
the title.

The other entrants in the 137
slot trying to cop the crown be-
side Gratto will include Vic De-
Felice of Skyscraper U., Tom
Grifa of Rutgers, and Les Austin

of Syracuse.

Competition at 147 Tight

The 147 pound class finds an-
other Lehigh Engineer in the
favored role. He is Dick Santoro
who had, a 10-0 season. Santoro
has never lost a dual meet’ match
in his varsity career, although he
has been beaten in tournament
competition.

Ray Poust of Penn State and
Bill Waples of Syracuse will
give Santoro the most trouble.
Other entrants will include: Don
Kovalchik of Rutgers, Larry
Fortenbaugh of Princeton, and
Don Yeats of F&M.

The heavier weights have as
much talent, but there are not as

many top entrants as the lighter 1

classes.

Johnson Seeks Third

Dave Johnson, a two time win-
ner for the Blue and Gold-——once
at 157 pounds -and then at 167
pounds, is back to try at 157.
Johnson had a 10-1 record with
the lone loss coming in the Iowa
State meet when he wrestled at
177. ‘

John Driscoll of Lehigh, Dick
Vincent of Cornell, Gordon Car-
berry of Syracuse ind Ed Haw-
thorne of Rutgers will give
Johnson all the competition he
can handle,

The outcome of the 167 pound
class depends how well Tom Al-
bert’s shoulder has healed. If he
can’t start, Alex Skirpan will re-
place him. Steve Friedman of Cor-
nell will be made favorite if Al-
berts is not ready. George of Rut-
gers will be another strong con-
tender.

The 177 pound class has no real
outstanding candidate. Bill White
of Syracuse is the best of the
group. Doug Volgenau of Navy,
John Kohr, of Yale, and Dick Gar-

retson will provide other opposi- -

tion. .

Tony Stremic, footballer turned
‘wrestler, will be favored in the
‘heavyweight class. Stremic was
runner-up to Schirf of the
Panthers in the Nationals, and
since Schirf has graduated, Strem-
ic will be out to cop the Eastern
title. Competition for Stremic will
come from John Traendly of Penn,
a 260 pound sophomore, Dave
Dundap of Cornell, Bill Pfromm-
ler of F&M, and Pete Davidson of
Lehigh.

The success of the Panther thin-
clads in the recently completed
indoor track season may prove to
be a forerunner of what to expect
from Carl Olson’s speedsters in
the outdoor season. i
The Panthers, who won third

--place in the ICAAA Champion-
ships two weeks ago with but six
men, have shown that they have
the neucleus which can help better
last year’s duel meet record of
three wins and two losses.

“My closest shave happened under water while baiting
sharks to photograph,” says shark expert Elgin Ciampi.
“My speared bait-ﬁsh hid in a hole, pouring clouds of
blood around me. Smelling blood, a 7-foot man—eater,
unable to find the bait,rushed me. I dodged and started
taking pictures. I kept the camera between us while
u the shark circled hungrily for five full minutes. Then
" my air supply ran short, so I used psychology: 1 lunged
at the shark with my camera. Startled, he i
shot away——and so did I!"

Foundation will be held for the
co-eds to meet exchange students
from Poland and view the Polish

“I guess everybody’s. a little concerned about his ﬁrst
assignment on a new job,” Robert Schopp says. “I
know I was. For one thing, I was worried about getting
stuck in some work I didn’t like—and not being able
to get into what I really wanted to do.”

Bob Schopp joined IBM in 1954. He already knew’

something about the company and electronic com-
puters, having worked part time during college at the
college IBM machine installation. “But I still didn't
know just how my M.E. degree from Kansas State
would be put to use,” he recalls.

He started as a Machine Designer in Production Engin-
eering, with cost reduction work as his primary respon-
sibility. “But, like most M.E.’s,” Bob Schopp says,
“I’m a ‘tinkerer’ by nature. I soon saw that Product
Development was the place for me. So I received a

transfer. You can do this at IBM because they believe I

that what's best for you is best for the company.”

Promoted in six months

Promoted six months
later to Associate
_ Engineer, he now works
as part of a small group
i headed up by a Project
Engineer. This “team”
consists of another
M.E. and himself, an
E.E. and a model-
maker. Bob Schopp is
an “idea man”—that
3 is, his efforts are de-
voted to basic develop-
ments rather than spe-
ciﬁc jobs. Right now, his project entails the creation of
the “ultimate package in printed circuitry.” His group
“brain storms” this project in continual sessions. The
results are put in model form. Then the group tries to
“tear the idea to shreds” in order to create something
even better.

  
 
 
   

Bob works in a small team

“I call this practical creativeness,” Bob Schopp says.
“You create freely, yet you work toward a practical
end. I guess maybe a quarter of my time goes into
‘dreaming.’ To me, this job is more creative than
production, less creative than pure research."

Many opportunities for the M.E.

While circuitry packaging is his present work area, ,

there are many other challenging projects under way
at IBM. All are handled by the same “small—team"
approach. “There are many ways,” Bob Schopp says.
“in which an M.E. can contribute tothe development
of com puters or other IBM machines. You may work on
either analog oridigital computersyori on theiroom-
