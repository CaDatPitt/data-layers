Congressman despite tax problems

to speak at
graduation

As Budget Committee chairman.
Gray is in the center of the ﬁght to
shape federal budget priorities. In
1980. during his freshman temi in Con-
gress, he wrote the bill that established
the African Development Foundation
to deliver visible U.S. aid to African
villages. In that same year, Gray made
legislative proposals to increase the
number of minority and women of-
ficers in the U.S. Foreign Service, and
his proposals were adopted as amend-
ments to a bill that was signed into law
by President Carter.

Since that time, Gray has made
minority and women's rights issues key
to his work on the House Committee
on Appropriations and that body‘s
Transportation and Foreign Operations
subcommittees, the District of Colum-
bia Committee and the Democratic
Steering and Policy Committee. Gray-
also has served as vice chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus.

Semester at Sea offers

Staff Writer

It happened again today. I was sit-
ting in my political science class, and
I started to daydream. I tried to focus
my attention back to the teacher. It’s
getting close to ﬁnals, and it was an im-
portant lecture. I think he was talking
about international relations, the role
that the United States plays in regard
to other countries. All I could think
was: Boy, I'd sure like to be in another
country now. I wonder what it’s like.
I've always wanted to go to Egypt. To
see the pyramids and the people, the
way they live. I wonder what the
students there are thinking right now.

Sometimes books get so dull. It’s
easy to dream about far away places.
There’s something mysterious and
adventuresome about it. Imagine hav-
ing classes on a ship and learning about

Oakland‘s self—proclaimed home of
rock ‘n’ roll is back in business. The
Decade returned to operation follow-
ing a brief shut down Tuesday aftemoon.

The state attorney general‘s office
seized the popular nightc|ub's assets
Tuesday after the Decade allegedly ran
up a more than $50,000 sales tax debt.
The building. located at 223 Atwood
Street. was padlocked by the sheriff‘s
office but was reopened shortly after-
ward. Dom DiSilvio. the promoter for
the Decade. was inside the bar at the
time.

“The Decade owed tax money and
they [the sheriff's deputies] came in to
collect it without any notification."
said DiSilvio. “They wanted a large
sum of money and the Decade's man-
agement didn't have the money at the
time to pay them on the spot. so they
padlocked the doors.

“The Decade wanted to give them
a portion of the money at the time, but

they wouldn’t agree to that. They
wanted all of the money right then.”

Authorities had gone to the Decade
asking for approximately half the
money owed — about $33,000. The
Department of Revenue had previous-
ly worked out a plan of payment with
the owners of the Decade so they could
pay back their debts. but the payments
were never met. When the owners
could not pay the sum, the bar was
padlocked. The Decade then filed for
bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code.

Chapter ll of the bankruptcy code
involves the reorganization of a
business. not its liquidation, and is
available to corporations and partner-
ships as well as individuals. The typical
Chapter ll case involves a business
that continues to operate after the
bankruptcy petition is filed. If a
bankruptcy trustee is named in such a
case, he will take over the business.
Generally, however. the debtor will re-
main in contror of the business after

bankruptcy issue is settled in court or

South African to speak at concert today

By Michael Ashford
Special Projects Editor

The organizers of today’s “Rock
Against Racism” concert say they
hope the event will be as much an op-
portunity to disseminate ideas and in-
fonnation as it will be to have fun in
the sun.

Besides the three bands scheduled to
perform, several groups and individ-
uals will be on hand to express their
views on the apartheid system in South
Africa and to voice the call for di-
vestment.

One featured speaker today is a
South African student preparing to
study mining engineering here at Pitt.
Zingie, as she calls herself, has been
in the United States for four years. As
a political refugee, she was able to
come to the United States on a scholar-

the world as you sail along. Imagine
going to Spain, Greece, Turkey,
Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

Jim Jacobus, a junior at Pitt, does not
have to imagine any of this because it
is exactly what he did last temi. Jim
was one of about 500 students from
colleges and universities throughout the
country to participate in what has
become known as the Semester at Sea
Program, academically sponsored by
the University of Pittsburgh. It is ad-
ministered through the Institute for
Shipboard Education, a non—proﬁt
organization designed for educational
purposes.

“It is an introduction to the world
that we live in," said John Tymitz, the
executive director for the Institute for
Shipboard Education. “There is no
substitute. It is more than just another
semester. It is a global semester which

ship and equipped with a United Na-
tions passport.

Commenting on the ongoing con-
frontation in South Africa between the
white minority government and a dis-
enfranchised black majority, Zingie
said, “The current situation is really
a consequence of two things: ﬁrst. the
intensification of apartheid as the gov-
ernment tries to maintain control and,
second, the realization by more and
more people that they can change
things with their action.

“People know now that they have
nothing to lose,“ she said.

Zingie explained that she herself
spent two years in prison for working
with resistance organizations.

“Somehow they always track you
down,” she said. “Because my in-
carceration coincided with Steve Biko’s
death in prison. the government was a

little more careful handling prisoners."

Steve Biko was a popular anti-apart-
heid leader who died under torture
while in prison in 1976. His death
received international attention and he
became a martyr to the resistance
movement.

“The pattern, however, is always the
same," Zingie said. “It is psycho-
logical and physical torture.“

Responding to claims that the South
African government is attempting ac-
tual reform, Zingie called the actions
“cosmetic. “

“They don‘t address the basic issues
of political and economic injustice,“
she said.

The reforms were enacted, Zingie
said, because “the government is
tremendously afraid of the ﬂight of
capital out of the country. That is why
it is a federal offense to talk about

divestment in South Africa.

“The South African people have
made clear that they want corporations
from the United States, England and
West Germany and everywhere else to
pull out," she stated. “That they don’t,
makes them complicitous in our eyes.

“If these companies truly had the
long-term interests in mind," Zingie
said, “they would leave South Africa
until actual change has occurr 

On the Sullivan Principles, Zingie
said, “They are prolonging apartheid
and cannot have any effect. First, all
companies must obey South African
law, which won’t allow true reformist
policies. Second, the number of peo-
ple affected is so small —— less than 0.5
percent of the black population —— that
they are completely insignificant.”

Zingie will address the crowd dur-
ing the concert this afternoon.

unique learning experience

combines a superior academic experi-
ence with a unique seagoing shared
community and unparallel traveling op-
portunities around the world.”

When speaking about his experiences
aboard the traveling university, Jacobus
gets a wistful look in his eyes.

“It definitely left a lasting impres-
sion," said Jacobus. “Every place was
so beautiful. In Sri Lanka it was a
tropical paradise. We saw wild ele-
phants. We went swimming on tropical
beaches, and we rode motorcycles in
the jungle. Even Bombay was beau-
tiful, although it was one of the most
disgusting places I’ve ever been to. But
that’s what is so great. You learn so
much. I left India not feeling sorry for
the people. It kills all the philanthropy
in you. In fact, I had some of the
greatest conversations in my life with
the people in Bombay.”

Fifty percent of the voyage is spent

at sea while the other 50 percent is
spent ashore, with port calls ranging
from three to seven days. The cur-
riculum consists of about 50 courses
geared to the ship’s ports of call. The
courses are all listed in Pitt’s College
of Arts and Sciences.

Pitt also appoints the academic dean
for every voyage. The dean is respon-
sible for all the academic planning and
recruiting of competent faculty.

“It's really an exciting program,"
said Barry Applbaum, the assistant
academic dean last fall on the S.S.
Universe, the name of the traveling
university. “It gives students the op-
portunity to do serious coursework in-
volving ﬁeld activities.”

All the students are required to take
a minimum of 12 credits aboard the
ship. “When we were in port," said
Jacobus, “we had more free time. The
professors didn’t make us do much

work then. But they didn‘t give us
breaks either. If you fail a class, you
fail a class.”

Tymitz said that they did studies on
the issue of academic performance and
found that students who had a 2.0 to
2.5 grade point average generally
brought their grades up when they were
on the ship.

“The ship is more of a one-to-one
relationship,” said Tymitz. “The
faculty members have more time and
can do more in the classes. Student in-
hibitions begin to dissolve."

Applbaum agrees that one of the
most rewarding aspects of the voyage
is the community that you become at-
tached to on the ship.

“You share a lot between the ports,”
said Applbaum, “a comraderie
develops.”

Black students
reverse segregation

WASHlN(}T()N The racial tables
were turned at Georgetown Universi~
ty as black students assumed power
over whites in an all-day anti-apartheid
demonstration. Mock rioting broke out
inid-day Wednesday on the steps ofthe
administration building. Bathrooms and
water fountains were segregated. and
sitting areas were designated “for
blacks only" and “for non-blacks.“

Student organizer Desiree Arrentz.
said the demonstration was aimed at
showing exactly how it feels to be
discriminated against. But some white
students apparently were unhappy with
the role—reversal and ripped down

segregationists' signs so they could use

the facilities without regard to the tem~

porary policy.

Semester at Sea

continued from page I

the core of the semester at sea. The
students are forced to deal with an
enclosed world. But the ship offers a
lot to keep the students busy. There is
a student union, a swimming pool, a
bar and a volleyball court. There are
also numerous extracurricular activities
such as the drama club, student coun-
cil and aerobic classes.

“It really was good," said Jacobus.
“It was neat interacting with the pro-
fessors and the other adult passengers.
Some of the best friends I've ever made
were on the ship. I’m going to be
spending a lot of money this summer
getting in touch with them.“

Jacobus sits back in his chair and ap-
pears thoughtful. “It’s probably time
for the sun to set," he said. “I should
go watch." He smiled. “It's a habit.
On the ship I used to get up to watch
the sun rise, and then I would go back
to sleep. The sunrises and sunsets on
the ship were incredible. Nothing on
land could compare."

Jacobus said that he saw so many in-
credible things that it is hard to think
of any one particular instance or scene
that stands out above the rest.

“If I had to say one though, it would
be the experience that I had in Japan."
said Jacobus. “I was traveling with
four friends, and we had been directed
by a travel agency to a campsite. When
we reached it we saw a big lake and
the sun was setting. We were psyched.
All you could see were rice ﬁelds.
everywhere you looked. We hadn't
brought any food, so we went to ﬁnd
a store. We found one finally. and the
owner was extremely nice. He even
drove us back to the campsite.

“The next day it was cloudy. and we
were bummed out." continued
Jacobus. “Then. all of a sudden the
owner of the store was there. and he
took us to his house. We stayed there
for the next three nights. and we
worked in his store. I ate raw squid.
octopus and whale. When we left. the
man told us that he had three American
brothers and one American sister. We
felt like crying.

“I guess it was special because it was
our introduction to Japan and to
Semester at Sea. It was the first port
that we had stopped at. For me. it was
the first foreign country I‘d ever been
in...

It is experience such as this that
makes the voyage so special to the
students. But not all students are for-
tunatc enough to have the opportunity
Jacobus did. Jacobus received a special
grant b_v the university which enabled
him to pay the price of a regular
semester at Pitt.

The average cost is between
$8.000—$I0.000. This does not include
personal expenses and transportation to
the ports of embarkation and
debarkation.

The Institute for Shipboard Educa-
tion seeks contributions from industry
and individuals who wish to assist the
students. A limited amount of ﬁnancial
aid is available to those students with
the greatest ﬁnancial need. There are
also loans, academic scholarships and
work-study programs available.

“It is expensive," said Applbaum,
“but so many students are caught up

ﬁnishing school and getting a job that
they don’t realize the beneﬁt of such
a broadening experience.”

The effort that it took to be able to
provide such a “broadening experi-
ence" for students stretches over many
years and a few dedicated individuals.

It all began in 1877 when shipboard
education was first considered by
James Woodruff of Indianapolis, Ind.
Woodruff wanted to take college stu-
dents around the world, but he died
before he had time to carry out his goal.

Then in I920. James Edwin Lough,
from the University of New York, led
a group of students on a tour of Greece.
There he met Constantine Raises, a
young Greek student at the University
of Athens. They developed a friendship
that was to last a lifetime.

Lough and Raises were excited by
the idea of a ﬂoating university. Both
men felt that the experience would be
invaluable to college students.

In 1925, Andrew McIntosh. a
wealthy shipping broker, gave the two
men $25,000 to help start their dream
of a ﬂoating university. Then the
Holland American Line offered, for
one dollar, the use of an idle ship.
Preparations began for the S.S.
Ryndam.

After a few problems, 504 students

set sail from New Jersey on Sept. 18,
I926, for a seven-and-a-half month
voyage which was viewed as a major
accomplishment. After the return of the
ship in May 1927 more unforeseen

_ problems arose.

It was not until '29 that the ﬂoating
university, now called the S.S.
Hirondelle, sailed again. Everything
went well until 1936. For the next 22
years, war and economic instability
forced the ship to remain docked.

In 1958, Dr. Gerald Black, a Whit-
tier. Calif., dentist and president of the
local Rotary Club, decided to form a
committee to work on world peace. He
appointed club member Bill Hughes as
the chairperson. Hughes was intrigued
by the idea of an international univer-
sity. He heard of Constantine Raises
and established contact with him.
Together, they came up with the
University of the Seven Seas.

They initially had problems ﬁnding
a ship, but the Holland American Line
came through again with a passenger
ship.

The ship sailed in ’63, and it markedi
the awakening of the traveling univer-
sity. But the ship only had two sails.
It needed to become part of an already
accredited. land-based college. Chap-
man College in California decided to

sponsor the ship. In I966, a larger ship
was found, and Chapman renamed the
program the World Campus Aﬂoat.

In 1970, the ship needed major
repairs. Chao—Yung Tung of Hong
Kong offered to help. Tung was a ﬁrm
believer of education, and he strongly
supported the idea of the traveling
university. He found and bought the
historic liner, the Queen Elizabeth II.
The ship was set to sail in January and
catastrophe struck. A ﬁre broke out on
the ship on Jan. 9 and could not be con-
trolled. But Tung did not give up. He
had purchased the liner Atlantic and
made it available to Chapman. In 1971
the ship sailed. Finally, in I975 Chap-
man could no longer continue to sup-
port the ship.

Two men at Chapman College, Dr.
Grifﬁth and Dr. John Tymitz, then
decided to ﬁnd a way to keep the
university sailing. In I971 they set up
a non-proﬁt corporation called the In-
stitute for Shipboard Education. They
also came up with the Semester at Sea
concept.

They found an academic sponsor in
the University of Colorado, and the
ship sailed in the spring of '77. Again.
problems arose ﬁnancially and in 1980
another search for a sponsor began.

“Four schools were interested." said

Tymitz. “The University of Pittsburgh
was chosen because of their widely
respected Center for International
Studies and for the fact that we needed
to spread to the East Coast to get more
students involved.”

In 1981 a formal agreement was
signed, and the ship sailed in the
spring. “I like it here,“ said Tymitz.

The university, led by President
Wesley Posvar, speaks favorably of the
program. “Semester at Sea is an

academic experience without parallel
in the world. Its beneﬁciaries are in-
deed students in the most ideal sense:
Beyond the superb faculty and rigor-
ous curriculum, they encounter the
voyage to unfamiliar landscapes and
cultures, by its very nature an utterly
profound stimulus to imagination and
personal growth. The University of
Pittsburgh is proud to be the academic
sponsor of this enterprise.”

It is students like Jim Jacobus that
beneﬁt from the program most.

“I feel that the experience has
changed me," said Jacobus. “I realize
now that there are problems in the
world but that basically everything is
okay."

Would he go back again?

“You bet,” said Jacobus, “as soon
as I can save up the money.”

The American Cancer Society has called for a ban
on cigarette companies sponsoring cultural and sport-

the advertisements is an attempt to reduce the cigarette .
consumption among the younger populace, it is doubt-
ful whether this type of ban will achieve the desired goal.
It has become obvious that cigarette smoking is, in
America, a health hazard of vast proportion. It is

The Ritqgl Dissent/James M. Crary

A foreign policy which took into

in the countries over which America
wanted control wouldn't be very
popular in I986, a period during which
we underwent a romance with the
moral equivalent of (‘ih* is Khan.

which few people in this country have
ever seen. smelled or tasted. Yet we
are determined to decide what is best
for them. Even after years of support
for murderous policies of Sonio/.a. we
believe ourselves wise enough to
choose new dictators.

If $5 billion worth of anything other
than bombs had been dropped on Viet-
nam, we wouldn‘t have had a country
of such waste and horror that no
American can travel there now. But we
wouldn‘t have our pet (ihengis Khan.

dollars tearing the intestines out of
communist soldiers on the silver

The goal in foreign policy should be
creating conditions where the ideals of
freedom. democracy and justice can
take root. It‘s hard to care about the
Declaration of Independence when

you’re a mother of five living in a
thatch house trying to wash the napalm
offa screaming baby that is evaporating
before your eyes.

If somebody thinks the :)ple of
Nicaragua are going to th' as for
bringing them war. he should go there
and ask. Such a person also would have
to suffer from the illusion that
American gunboat diplomacy actually
had the interests of peace and freedom
in mind. Peace. freedom and justice are
difficult to discern at a distance so
obscured by ideology.

The continuing adventures of the
gunboat diplomats are nothing if not a
failure on the part of Washington think

policies intended to help the people of

also have to inspire people to believe
in democracy; we have to be sensitive
to their desires for peace and freedom.

Nicaragua won't be free if the (‘on-
tras win the war because the Contras
don‘t know what peace and freedom
are. The Contras are the old guard of
Somo/ta. They will simply establish yet

18 months. Wissinger, a sophomore at
Pitt, said, “The biggest problem with
the Angels nationwide is that people
don’t understand what the Angels are
about. There are misconceptions that
we‘re a gang or vigilantes. Some say
we’re socialists or communists, and
that’s not so."

When asked about the campus po-
lice, Wissinger replied, “The campus
police are doing what they’re supposed
to, though the campus police are not
as effective in deterring crime as the
Angels. I think they're afraid that we're
posing a threat to their job."

Walt Waters. assistant director of
public safety, said. “The' campus
police are an adequately staffed force,

and we’re utilizing the officers to the A

best of their capabilities."

Waters stated that Pitt‘s campus
police do not have the manpower for
an escort service. though the officers
will drive behind a yoting female to her
destination at late hours.

'‘I’d like to stun a campus organiza-
tion concerncd about crime.“ said
Waters. According to Waters. the force
will attempt to organize such an organ-
ization this summer.

In 1984. thefts were the No. 1 crime
with 667 thefts reponed to the campus
police. Disorderly conduct was second
with 242 reports. Waters said crime is
decreasing. but he provided no sta-
tistics for 1985 and 1986. Over the last
12 years there have been two murders
on campus.

why the Decade should not continue to

however. there is no reason to expect

DiSilvio expects all the debts to be

“The Decade pays all its taxes. and

“The Decade is an institution of rock

Cubist Canvases

More paintings about buildings and trees

By Shaun Martin

Although artist Jean Metzinger
(1883-1956) played a key part in the
development of Cubism and was co-
author with Albert Gleizes of the first
treatise on the movement, Du
"Cubism, ” he has often been
overlooked as a founder and a main
artist of Cubism. Now, after almost 70
years of being overshadowed by
Picasso and Braque, the works of Met-
zinger are on exhibit at Carnegie In-
stitute from now until May 25.

Metzinger is most closely associated
with “analytica|" Cubism, the first
phase of the development of the move-
ment. Cubism rejected the long-
standing tradition of 3-dimensionality
of the Renaissance and the impres-
sionists’ ideal of capturing a transient
moment. Rather, objects were de-
picted by capturing different views at

different times and translating them .

onto a single canvas. They were
broken down and analyzed into in-
teresting and overlapping planes. Col-
or was almost monochromatic, and
subject matter was not meant to be ex-
pressive or symbolic.

In Metzinger’s “Le Village," we are
given a bird’s-eye view of a city land-
scape. The colors are very somber and
dull, ranging from the dark greens of
a forest to the muddy whites of the
clouds. Buildings and trees are broken
down into elemental shapes as they
are seen from different vantage points.
There is an unusual curved perspec-
tive in the painting that almost lets us
see the path that our “bird’s eyes” will
fly before it actually happens.

Metzinger was the bridge between
the two schools of Cubism, that of
Picasso and his following at Mont-
martre and of Jacques Villons at
Puteaux. He gradually became more
closely associated with the Puteaux
group and was even said to have
misunderstood Cubism because of his
divergeance from Picasso's more
widely accepted interpretation of the
movement.

After 1912 Cubism went through its

second stage, “synthetic” Cubism,
which shifted its emphasis away from
the analysis of solid forms to the

1913-14, we get a glimpse of pre-World
War I Parisian life. A woman sits at a
table smoking her cigarette. We see
her face broken into three distinct
“panels" each representing a different
time. To the left her face is looking at
the viewer. The center panel shows a
profile, her hand pulling the cigarette

intense. The center section, however,
is depicted in the gloomy night. Given
the period, perhaps this represents
both the sophisticated, proud female
smoking in public and the guilty,
shameful woman. However, we must
remember that Cubism strived not to
be symbolic and, therefore, any subse-

quent interpretations are wholely our
own.

During the first world war, the cubist
movement was breaking up and Met-
zinger, along with his close friend,
Juan Gris, became associated with
what is sometimes called “classical”
Cubism. This phase was less radical
and less strict than the two preceding
stages and sought reason and clarity.
“Fruit and Jug on a Table” is one such
work. Colors in this still life are richer
than in his earlier works, yet they are
still subdued. The use of strongly cur-
vilinear forms as well as geometrically
simplified forms also come into play.

This exhibit also includes works
before and after Metzinger’s ex-
periments with Cubism. Metzinger
painted many beautiful pointalist paint-
ings early in his career. “Two Nudes
in a Garden,” c. 1906, depicts two
nude women standing in a gently sunlit
garden. The painting is more like a
mosaic than a pointalist study, each
“point” being a rectangular patch “set
into” a beige background. The sun
radiates its warmth and soft light in
concentric circles in mixed shades of
pink, blues, yellows and greens. The
women themselves are painted in a
patchwork of pink and light green.
Because Metzinger chose to use both
warm and cool colors in this painting,
our mood is constantly shifting but re-
mains very pleasant overall.

World War I broke up the cubist
movement, and Metzinger turned to
other, more traditional means of
representation, “Peches et Faisan,” c.
1926, is a very clear and simple paint-
ing of a woman placing a bowl of
peaches on a table off which hangs a
dead pheasant. Without the woman
this would be a still life, although the
woman is so motionless and unlifelike
that it still may be considered this.
There is minimal play with light and
depth. Colors, although more realistic
than in his earlier works, are flat and
exaggerated. The quality of his work
appears to have been in decline at this
period, however, in this show there is
more than enough evidence to qualify
him as a leading figure of early 20th
century art.

The Money Pit:A Bad Entertainment Investment

By Eric Glick

Lately, movie screens across
America have suffered the deluge of
Steven Spielberg produced or directed
films (Back to the Future, Young
Sherlock Holmes, and The Color Pur-
ple, to name a few). The latest of these,
The Money Pit, a Richard Benjamin
film, is a comedy starring Tom Hanks
and Shelley Long. It is about a young
couple who purchase what they think
is a dream house at a price which
could be considered a steal. The
house, of course, has more than its
share of problems. So much for the
premise. The problems with this film
are multiple, complicated further by
choppy editing and extremely bad
slapstick humor.

Sometimes physical humor can be
quite entertaining. The greats —
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and,
more recently, Peter Sellers —— refined
it to an art, encompassing all the
subtleties and gestures necessary to
make physical comedy funny. In The
Money Pit, however, the slapstick is
unwarranted, useless and serves on-
ly to create an awkward atmosphere.
More importantly, it makes Hanks and
Long look truly silly and depletes
energy from their performances. In a
rather involved scene, Walter (Hanks)
gets literally thrown out of the house
and lands in the fountain. A laugh is
probably supposed to be the au-
dience’s reaction, but one can’t help

   

feeling sorry for Walter, and even sor-
rier for Hanks who, undoubtedly, had
to spend weeks in training for those
few minutes.

The problems with a film like The
Money Pit don't end with the fact that
it fails to entertain. Unfortunately, for
director Benjamin (director of My

Favorite Year, a fine film) it acts as a
strike against him. Benjamin's direc-
tion is not completely responsible,
though. The acting is fair; as good as
can be expected in a film of this kind.
The script, however, serves as an ex-
ample of the banality and mediocrity
that typifies recent Hollywood com-
edies. The fact that Mr. Spielberg

 
  

chose to produce this film only adds
more darkness to this grim picture.
One would hope that a producerldirec—
tor of Spielberg’s prestige and in-
fluence would be a bit more selective
of films to which he attaches his name
and reputation. We may be forgiving
toward Spielberg, however, consider-

point is we shouldn’t have .to forgive
him. One can only hope that as he
grows older, his tastes will mature, and
his selection will narrow.

Other problems with this film are,
unfortunately, commonplace in the
light of many recent examples of bad
Hollywood comedy. Besides a rancid

of insipid material. It must have been

 
 

ing his excellent track record, but the difficult for them to have worked with

and stale script, there are several
unclean cuts in the editing, and some
flat acting in the parts of minor
characters. The real problems occur,
however, when Hanks, Long and
veteran performers like Maureen
Stapleton are expected to make sense

4‘ y 5;,“ y _; )4.‘

such low-brow material, and it shows.

Hollywood has recently been lag-
ging in its comedies. It started over the
summer and seems to have continued
through this year. One can only hope
that things get better. Otherwise, a trip
to the movies may seem more like a
visit to the dentist.

CANDY APPLE GREY
Husker Du
Warner Bros.

The Minneapolis trio Husker Du has
traveled many musical miles in the six
years they've been together. From the
maniac. white noise abandon of 1982’s
Land Speed Record, Husker Du has
progressed to creating smart, impas-
sioned pop-punk records like last
year’s New Day Rising and Flip Your
Wig, albums rich in memorable
melodies. But creating some of rock’s
most creative, original music hasn’t
brought the band commercial success.
Bob Mould and Grant Hart’s frenzied
vocal deliveries, and Mould’s thick,
statically distorted guitar sound have
probably been enough to convince
more conservative radio programmers
to keep from giving Husker Du the
chance to break into the listenership
niches bands like R.E.M. and U2 have
found. But Husker Du’s major label
debut Candy Apple Grey may prove to
be the record that finally lifts the band
over the top.

When the Huskers left SST records
last year to record for Warner Bros.,
some followers of the band worried
that their music would be toned down
somehow and that soon we’d see the
group opening arena shows for
Madonna. Such fears were illogical.
With their new album, Husker Du con-
tinues on their long-established path
into new musical territory by further
refining their compositions while re-
maining as intense and powerful as
they have ever been on vinyl.

‘Three tremendous, essentially
acoustic songs prove to be the biggest
surprises on Candy Apple Grey. Grant

DIRTY WORK
Rolling Stones
Rolling Stones Records

Allow me to cast some stones. Mick,
Keith and the boys lost their power to
surprise and subvert over 15 years
ago. There have been great moments
on the handful of albums that the band
has released in recent years: “Beast
of Burden,” “Hang Fire,” “Worried
About You” and “Waiting on a
Friend,” a rare attempt at compassion
and one of the Stones’ finest moments
ever. But has this band become too
tired, too bored or too comfortable to
produce a consistently satisfying
work? As usual, high expectations
greeted the release of Dirty Work. Does
the new album give us anything as ter-
rifying as “Gimme Shelter” or “Sym-
pathy for the Devil”? Are there
moments as buoyant and brassy as
“Tumblin’ Dice” or “Rocks Off”? Ob-
viously, the answer is no, but Dirty
Work is what we have come to expect
from the Rolling Stones. There are no
explosions but rather a series of un-
connected sparks of life from the
deposed “world’s greatest rock ‘n’ roll
bandf’

Dirty Work is chock full of Jagger’s
foul-mouthed snarling and Keith
Richards’ six-string sting. Do some of
these riffs sound a bit familiar? “Had
it With You” is about the 12th rewrite

Hart’s “No Promise Have I Made”
could be a typical Top 40 ballad as it
opens with flowing piano runs, but in-
stead it turns into a chilling defensive
as Hart walls the chorus above the
metallic din of his cymbal. Bob Mould’s
two acoustic guitar songs are equally
moving. “Too Far Down” benefits from

 

 

one of Mould’s finest vocal perform-
ances, his voice jumping_ to catch
every lyrical nuance. The ballad
“Hardly Getting Over It’’ uses soft in-
strumentation and hushed singing to
contrast the hard-edged, at times
Dylan-esque words: My parents, they
just wonder when they both are going
to die/ And what do I do when they

of “Respectable” from Some Girls. lt’s
a decent song which is practically beg-
ging not to be dredged up again. The
single “Harlem Shuffle” quickly grows

. stale after a few listens much like

1980’s tedious “Emotional Rescue.”
The only value in “Harlem Shuffle” is
that the yeah, yeah, yeah’s in the
chorus are reminiscent of the fade-out

of “Bitch,” one of the nastiest four
minutes in the entire Stones catalogue.
The absolute low point on Dirty Work
is the cliche ridden “Hold Back.” Even
though Jagger’s suggestion to grab
opportunity while you ’re alive may be
sincere, the droning guitars sink the
song and render it a tuneless and
monotonous bore.

Don’t despair, Stonophiles. Dirty
Work is not completely amiss. As
usual, Charlie Watts keeps time like a
fine Swiss watch and Keith actually
sings on the lovely “Sleep Tonight.”
He's abandoned his familiar gargling
and wheezing and actually sings for a
change. “One Hit (T o the Body)” is a
steamy dance tune that would have

 

 

die?/ Now I’m hardly getting over it/
Hardly getting used to getting by.
Mould and Hart, as well as bassist
Greg Norton, branch out musically
throughout the album. Besides the
acoustic pieces, Husker Du blends
’60s pop with The Ramones’ guitar
overdrive (“Dead Set on Destruction”),

gives psychee arce twist
(“Sorry Somehow”) and simply rocks
out (‘‘I Don’t Know for Sure,” “Don’t
Want to Know if You are Lonely”).
Every song benefits from the clean
production offered the band in record-
ing for a major label. And while the
sound is clearer, it has in no way

become antiseptic; the vocal har- V J

' made a superior choice as a single and

both “Fight” and “Dirty Work” are
classically styled Stones rockers that
somehow sound fresh to these ears.
I wish Dirty Work was full of such
moments.

I love rock music because of the
Rolling Stones. For three years my
musical diet was strictly Stones. As a

    

14-year-old, this band was the audio
equivalent of a Playboy magazine.
Some Girls is the type of album that
had to be listened to behind a locked
bedroom door. God only knows what
Mom would do if she heard Mick use
the ‘F’ word. To me, the Rolling Stones
have always been the essence of rock
‘n’ roll, vile and abrasive but always ex-
hilarating. I may be expecting too
much of this band in 1986. Maybe Dir-
ty Work will serve as a new genera-
tion’s introduction to the art of the Roll-
ing Stones. Or maybe this is just
another average (not even good)
Stones album. I would rather not
ponder such weighty questions right
now. I think l’|l seek exile on Main

Now We See That Such Fears Were illogical

monies stand out above the in-
struments to work as one great sonic
mass.

Lyrically we find Husker Du still
frustrated and trying to make some
sense of what makes no sense at all.
While Hart continues to explore the
outer parameters of “love songs” on
tracks like “No Promise Have I Made”
(If I could change my mind, what
changes would it bring/ If I could
change you, well it wouldn’t change a
thing) and the vindictive but confused
“Sorry Somehow” (Life too can cut
you and I ’ve cut you out of mine/ You ’re
making me  Sorry, sorry somehow),
Bob Mould struggles with reality’s in-
justice. Mould remains short on
answers, (I never get confused ‘cause
I don ’t really know/ So I ’m happy and
so what/ So what means that I don ’t
know from ‘‘I Don’t Know For Sure”)
but creates moving scenes from his
personal and, ever more universal,
pain. When Mould yells, The finest
things in life are the ones that can never
be hurt, in “Crystal,” every word

seems to snap back at an uncaring,

decaying society.

Candy Apple Grey provides soaring,
raging, moving music, desperate, long-
ing lyrics and the finest collection of
songs l’ve heard on an album in over
a year. This is a band paving new
musical paths with aggressive and,
almost certainly, honest rock music.
Don’t wait for mainstream radio and
the record-buying public-at-large to
catch up to this band. Find Husker
Du,’s Candy Apple Grey and ex-
perience the passion rock ‘n’ roll is
meant to deliver.

The Firm:seemsthey’ve lost their grip on reality

   

THE FIRM
Civic Arena
March 27, 1986

By David Zafrls

The scene looks like it came out of
a horror movie: Smoke fills the stage
and only four olive-colored laser
beams pierce through the darkness. A
thin, sinewy creature with long, scragg-
ly black hair moves within the pyramid
of light, raising a long violin bow that
disappears into the darkness. A guitar
is cradled sensuously between the
creature's legs as an eerie feedback
blasts from hidden amplifiers.

Jimmy Page, the mystical guitarist
for The Firm, has just finished a varia-
tion of a Chopin prelude. The crowd
cheers frantically, worshipping the lone
figure presented to them.

Without Robert Plant’s searing,
screeching vocals to support him, Jim-
my Page stands out as a one-man
show with The Firm. Paul Rodgers ap-
parently has trouble keeping up with
Page’s flying fingers, and he seems
like he has trouble translating Page’s
heavy metal/psychedelic/classical
guitar riffs. As a result, The Firm’s con-
cert at the Civic Arena last Thursday
resembled more a freak show, featur-
ing the former Yardbird and Led Zep-
pelin guitarist, than it did a rock
performance.

Page has been branded a heavy
metal guitarist throughout his career,
but his critics often fail to recognize the
dramatic shifts during his perfor-
mances. One moment his guitar
sounds like thunder, the next moment
only a whisper. During last week's con-
cert, Page provided the crowd a quiet
interlude before the thunderous roar of
The Firm’s “Live in Peace.” On an

acoustic guitar, Page played a song in-
fluenced by Indian and folk music, a
song that originated as the Yardbirds’
“White Summer” and included sec-
tions of Led Zeppelin's “Black Moun-
tain Side.” Page has played the tune
throughout his career, and it has e-
volved into the guitarist’s personal

 P

concerto.

Shifts in tempo in Page’s concerts
are nothing new, and they have led
critics to label his dramatics as ramb-
lings from an eccentric. Clearly,
Page’s personal preoccupation with
the occult rubs off on his perfor-
mances. Page has expressed his in-

. 4 . i . _ .

terest as a “quest for knowledge,” and
he maintains that he is not a devil wor-
shipper. In 1968, before he played with
The Yardbirds, Page purchased a
house owned by Aleister Crowley.
Page had plenty of money through his
work as a session guitarist and spent
much of it on the renovatign of

Crowley's house.

The name of the building, the
Boleskine House, originated from the
10th century, when a church burned
down there along with its entire con-
gregation. Crowley, a philosopher who
performed pagan rituals, built the
Boleskine House on the sight of the

Scottish church, which rested on the
shores of Loch Ness. Crowley didn't
have a very high opinion of women,
and he reportedly performed satanic
rituals at his home,

Page hired satanist Charles Pace to
paint murals in his newly acquired
home, but he maintained that the oc-
cult was just a curiosity of his, and it
should not be blown out of proportion.

When Led Zeppelin drummer John
Bonham died of suffocation in Page’s
home in 1980, rumors were circulated
that Page’s mysticism had something
to do with Bonham’s death. in reality,
Bonham apparently drank too much.
Police reports stated Bonham had too
much to drink, passed out on a bed
face down and drowned in his own
vomit.

Led Zeppelin broke up as a result of
Bonham’s death, because the band
was apparently too closely knit to go
on with another drummer. When Page
announced over two years ago that he
and former Bad Company singer Paul
Rogers were forming a new band
called The Firm, many fans expected
the music to resemble Led Zeppelin’s.
The Rogers-Page combination,
however, has failed to live up to the
legends of their previous bands, and
rumors of Led Zeppelin and Bad Com-
pany reunions are beginning to
appean

But Page, with his bow raised high
into the shadows, still resembled a
modern-day Paganini, the violinist who
hypnotized women and made them
faint with his grinding sensuality. Men
said that Paganini must have been
possessed by the devil, considering
the effects of his playing. Maybe men
make these assertions about Page and
Paganini because they refuse to ap-
preciate their talent. lt’s a lot easier to
label an eccentric as a satanic, heavy
metal dinosaur rocker.

Translator: Standing In Line

When rock critics are called upon to
name their favorite unsung American
bands, names like The Replacements
and The Meat Puppets usually come
up, and deservedly so, but rarely do
we hear the name Translator arise.

 These fellows have been cranking out

i

high quality rock ‘n’ roll for years, with
progressive improvements in song-
writing technique and sound quality.
Perhaps this single, a breakneck blues
number with a catchy, Byrds-like
chorus, will finally win them some of
the recognition they’ve always de-
served. No one can ever tell what will
go on to become a hit and what won't
— there are a thousand variables in-
volved — but “Standing In Line” cer-

° tainly deserves airplay. Translator has

the polish now to break out into the
“mainstream,” but they still have the
same gutsiness and integrity that's

made them interesting all along.

Not bad, but it might have been

Feargal Sharkey: A Good Heart
Dave Stewart’s popularity as a pro-
ducer is perhaps the worst trend in
contemporary music: He has a way of
making anything he touches turn to
boring rubbish. “A Good Heart”
manages to shine through the techno-
logical murk, just barely, and only
because the author is Lone Justice's
Maria McKee, whose sassy, hook-filled
songs are virtually foolproof. (I'd love
to hear this song in its original country
& western setting.) The song is also a
good showcase for Sharkey’s voice,
and if this single doesn't do as well in
this country as it did in England (where
it went to No. 1), he can take heart in
the knowledge that a song with true
grit can’t be destroyed, even by the
man responsible for some of the cold-
est, deadest music the '80s have
produced.

are thinking of doing cover of Henry
Mancini’s “Theme From Peter Gunn,”
please, for God's sake, don’t. Three
recent versions by bands of diverse
styles indicate that there is nothing
new to be done with the venerable riff.
Of these three, surf band The
Delmonas’ version is slightly more suc-
cessful than the other two, perhaps
because it is the most faithful to the
original. From The Art Of Noise we
have mere product, with the gimmick
being Duane Eddy’s ghost (they now
can digitally sample actual styles of
musicians, so that anyone playing the
keyboard can “become” that musi-
cian, but in this context, who gives a
damn?); the result is no more in-
teresting than Grandmaster Flash’s
pedestrian rap reworking, full of the
now-cliched
“scratching" and a few bars of funk
harmony, all very tired and contrived.
“Peter Gunn” deserves better treat-
ment than these half-hearted did-
dlings. lt’s not out of the question that
someone might do something really

stunning with it, but l’ll not expect it

any time in the near future, and at any
rate l’ve had my fill for the next five
years. Is there a creative drought? Get
this crap out of my face!

It eats up the high notes like a tractor

somewhat of a problem singing songs
from her last album Feel My Soul, Say
You Love Me is a wonderful effort in
which Jennifer Holliday’s high-octane
delivery is produced within the
framework of popular soul music's
perfect balance of energy and believ-
ability.

Say You Love Me begins with
Michael Jackson’s “You Are The
One,” a good example of Holliday’s
ability to control her falsetto and re-
main within the realm where pop
listeners’ mostly listen. The same is
true with the downcast “Dreams Never

avenues and cul-de-sacs as death rock

out only when she needs to, and the

around and break your heart with a
simple line like, It hurts to let go/ But
it hurts to hold on. On Duke El|ington’s
“Come Sunday,” Holliday lets her
gospel yells loose and adds a couple
more cracks to the church ceiling.
But Say, You Love me is not an
album of ballads. A pair of mighty soul
cuts, “Just a Matter of Time” and

Harris/Holliday  

“He’s a Pretender,” flow right into
each other, and Holliday belts out the
dynamic “What Kind of Love Is This”
like Chaka Khan with her hair on fire.
“No Frills Love,” the Arthur Baker
dance hit, is the album’s best cut. Time
is on my.side/ Cause I been around,
Holliday admits, securing the “| Need

with plenty of thunder and lightning
verve. When this lady says she wants
a no-frills love, she means it.

If Sam Harris qualifies as a falling
star in this musical galaxy, then Jen-
nifer Holliday is a rising star. Catch her,
before she’s out of sight.

By Dave Zuchowski

lt’s award season again! Grammys
last month; Oscars just last week. And,
here in Pittsburgh, the Sixth Annual
Restaurant Survey, published in this

;- April's Pittsburgh Magazine. Oakland's

own favorite dining spot, Angel’s Cor-
ner, was a winner in six of the survey
categories, meriting two first-place
trophies, one for Best American
Cuisine and one for Best Menu. The
restaurant also received second-place
awards in the Best Service, the Most
Underrated and Best Moderate-Priced
Restaurant categories. Finally, in the
category of Best Neighborhood
Restaurant, it came in third.

This plethora of civic plaudits and

:1 esteem seems indeed to be merited

based upon my last week's outing
there. For starters, the credentials of
the personnel are impressive, as
owners Charles and Shawn Davis,
Chef Matthew Musmanno and Wine
Steward Erik Schwarzl are all
graduates of the four-star-rated
Hyehold Restaurant.

But why the name Angel’s Corner,
you ask? Well the restaurant graces
the corner of Atwood and Bates
streets, but more significantly, it had
formerly been the Holy Spirit Byzantine
Catholic Church, hence its angelic
appellation. The shell of the former
building has been left intact. What
used to be the choir loft now serves as

, bar and lounge area, where on Satur-

day nights you’ll be entertained by a
live classical guitarist. The loft is also
being used to serve dinner parties of
between 15-25 people. The original
stained-glass windows, illuminated by
night from the outside, remain. The
marble slab on the buffet table at the
front of the restaurant used to be part
of the original altar of the church. And
the painting above the buffet table
sports three angels, exemplifying the
theme of the restaurant.

The restaurant was given a second-
place award for Service — I'll say no
more about the waiters than that they
were polite, knowledgeable, efficient
and unobtrusive. Management here
seems to be greatly concerned with

‘the quality and freshness of the food,

which is beautifully presented. The
menu is daring and innovative. For in-
stance, the creamy Parmesan dress-
ing, a mixture of sour cream,
mayonaise and grated Parmesan and
Romano cheese, is so thick that it's
pastry-tubed into rosettes and placed
on the salad. The lettuce is unique —
its hydroponically grown, and the roots
are still intact when purchased. (Don’t
worry, they’re removed in the kitchen
before being served.)

The dinner rolls show a creative flair.
Some are shaped like angel wings;
others are biscuit-like in flavor and tex-
ture. The rolls vary from day to day but
more importantly, are homemade and
delicious.

We began our meal with Chef
Musmanno's version of angels on
horseback, called Royal English
Oysters ($4.25). The oysters were
topped with seasoned buttered bread
crumbs, chopped bacon and parsley,

'then broiled and garnished with lemon

wedges. As much as we enjoyed the
dish, we liked the Smoked Salmon
Rosettes ($5.95) even more. Luscious

nova lox were wrapped around a
cream cheese and caviar filling that
had been splashed with a touch of
vodka. The salmon was served with
chopped red onion, capers, lemon
wedges and soft, homemade rye toast.

Salad is included with each entree
and consists of lettuce, julienned red
pepper and sliced cucumber. Crum-
bled bits of bleu cheese are offered by
the waiter and go well with the creamy
cheese dressing.

There are three daily dinner
specials, one seafood, one veal and
one beef selection, the style of
preparation changes from time to time.
The beef, for instance, is called
Medallions St. Martha (named after the
patron saint of cooking) and is two 4
oz. cuts of filet mignon prepared and
sauced according to the mode of the
day. We opted for two of the regular
menu items, one being Scrod Sereda

($13.25), a filet of haddock, topped
with diagonal strips of smoked salmon
and leek, then baked to a moist finish
and served with a side of Hollandaise.
All the seafood entrees_come with a
side of pasta, again varying from time
to time. My pasta was a blend of shell
noodles covered with a rich tomato
cream sauce.

Our other entree was Casmaron
Chicken ($13.50), large chunks of
boneless chicken and jumbo
Chesapeake Bay crabmeat that were
simmered in a chicken and cream
veloute sauce and served over fet-
tucine noodles garnished with crab
claws. The dish had an abundance of
meat, and the chicken-crab combina-
tion proved to be a successful and in-
novative idea. Both entrees came with
a side dish of gently sauteed zucchini,
yellow squash and asparagus spears.

The meal was brought to a suc-

Angel’s Corner:From theSub|ime to the Divine

cessful conclusion by ordering a
raspberry torte (all the desserts are
homemade and cost $3). The torte was
a layered cake made with raspberry
jam, separated by intervals of vanilla
Bavarian cream and topped with a but-
ter cream icing.

In addition to serving cocktails and
the usual variety of house wines, two
special wines of the week are available
by the glass. The wine list is also worth
perusing as it offers a variety of in-
teresting selections.

By G.B. Patterson I

Once upon a time  there was this
college. And this college was the
perfect place to be in the springtime.
It was a pretty good place to hang the
rest of the year too, but spring was a
special time — even better than
Christmas. So anyway, it’s springtime
at this college and all the students are
just enjoying the warm weather and
sunshine. The atmosphere is quite
relaxed. Nobody has anything that has
to get done right away. Tension is low.

But, what reason is there to feel
stress? This college is blessed more
than almost any other college. lt’s
located in one of the best cities in the
whole country. It has two main
beaches, one smaller one and a resort
beach at one of the dorm condos.
Classes are strictly optional — like any
good stop sign. The profs are seen on
the school's beaches throwing some

   

"""i"""‘HA VE A NICE DA

disc with the students. They even join
in on a little Ultimate on the weekends
— that means Saturday and Sunday,
which are hard to identify since every
day is like the weekend.

Not only does this institution of
higher learning have private beaches,
it has a shorter year than any other
school. The students finish winter
semester about a month ahead of their
friends. This allows them to start their
summer festivities earlier than
everyone else. This place has
everything a student could want, and
much, much more 

You may or may not realize that I’m
talking about our very own university.
Yes, Pitt. So where are all those
beaches pal? They’re all around us,
valued reader. Soldiers and Sailors
memorial, Flagstaff Hill, the Cathedral
lawn and the deck down at Forbes Hall
-— all of these are the beaches about
which I speak. After all, what com-

‘<

prises a beach? is it pushy tourists
fumbling around with umbrellas and
playpens on the sand? is it men and
women walking by the water in a
perma-pose? I think not. Isn't a true
beach what we have right here in
Oakland? Lots of happy people sitting,
playing, sunning and learning, maybe
not book learning, but learning just the
same — this is what we have here at
Pitt. And to tell you the truth, I enjoy
this beach more than the sandy ones
I frequent during the summer months.
You should too. Have fun, treasure this
time, it's special.

Back to that college again —— it's wild
just to walk around it right about now.
You’ll see people dressed in bright,
happy colors. They’re wearing shorts
and sunglasses. They are content. The
whole atmosphere is very up. What’s
ironic is that finals are coming up, and
along with them are final projects and
term papers — and nobody cares! I

 
     

guess t at may be a tad strong. Wh
I mean to say is that people start to get
things into perspective when the sun
comes out. They realize that no project
is impossible, nor is its deadline. They
see that a semester has just slipped by
them. They feel that a class missed
won’t kill them or their profs, but that
it may make them a whole lot more
able to handle the pressures put upon
the average student.

So I tell you to go to our beaches.
Blow off a class (or two) and enjoy
yourself. In the long run, you’ll feel bet-
ter and probably do better. Revel in the
people you see combing our beaches.
But the main point is to relax. Hey, the
sun is out!

Cha} .PalIa/The Pitt . 'ews

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Just eight practices and two scrim-
mages into spring football drills, Mike
Gottfried appears well on his way to
conquering some of his goals.

With Pitt having depth problems at
most positions, Gottfried hasn‘t prom-
ised anything close to a national cham-
pionship in his initial season as head
coach. But he did stress that the 1986
edition of the Panthers would be giv-
ing l00 percent at all times. something
many speculated wasn‘t happening with
Foge Fazio‘s teams in recent seasons.

Pitt showed the characteristics of
hustle, desire and hard work at Mon-
day afternoon’s scrimmage, and Gott-
fried was more than pleased.

“I see good working habits," Gott-
fried said. “I’m satisﬁed with the way
the players have been working.
They‘re showing me that they want to
win. And there’s only one way to win
— and that‘s when you work hard."

The installation of new game plans
on both offense and defense and Gott-
fried‘s disciplinarian way of thinking
is making it twice as difficult for the
players, but the new coach insists
everything is going according to plan.

“We‘ve only practiced eight times,"
Gottfried said. “but I’m really happy

why he holds that title.

“It feels great. but I have a lot more
to do'." McRae said. “Indoors [track]
is over, but I am looking forward to
outdoors. I want to better my times."

For a man who possesses even the
talent McRae does. improving his
speed will not be easy -- he can‘t get
much faster. He works out daily at Pitt
Stadium. running sprint after sprint. at-
tempting to make a smooth adjustment
from the indoor season to the outdoor
season.

Pitt students will get their first
chance to see the 1986 Pitt football
team when it holds an intra—squad
scrimmage this Saturday morning
at Pitt Stadium. Kickoff is at 9:30
a.m.

Immediately following the scrim-
mage. the Pitt track team will host
the Panther Relays. featuring the
fastest man in the world. sprinter
Lee McRae.

McRae. a sophmorc from Pem-
broke. N.C.. is the world record
holder in the 55—meter dash and the
NCAA champion in the same
event.

He will be joined at the Panther

on his strength. getting out of the
blocks. Now, during the outdoor sea-
son. it is the lOO—meters he competes
in. He must not only start fast but ﬁn-
ish fast in those extra 45 meters.

“My start is definitely a strength."
McRae said. “but now I have to work
on my kick."

That means spending more time in
the Pitt weight room. McRae said he

The two—mile team was cham-
pion ofthe Big East and the IC4As
before eventually achieving All-
America recognition by ﬁnishing
fourth at the NCAAs.

On the other end of the scope,
ﬁrst—year Pitt head football coach
Mike Gottfried will display his
wide open offense and the new 4-3
defense.

It will be the third scrimmage that
Gottfried has held during spring
drills, and he believes it is time for
the Pitt students to get acquainted
with the new Panthers.

The weatherman is expecting
sunny skies with a high of 65
degrees. Admission is free to Pitt
students. but you must have a
university I.D.

 

at this point. The players have an awful
lot to learn because we’ve been throw-
ing so much at them, but they’ve real-
ly responded well.” ‘

While Gottfried contends that he
spends most of his time teaching the of-
fense, it was the defense that drew his
praise in Monday’s scrimmage.

“Our defense really looked good.
They were very aggressive. find I love
to see that. The defensive line was get-
ting a good pass rush —- they really
ﬂew off the ball.“

Pitt‘s defensive line drew criticism
last season as it failed to put much
pressure on opposing quarterbacks.
The lack of a pass rush helped turn the
Panthers into one of the worst pass
defense teams in the country.

That doesn’t worry Gottfried,
however. He looks at the positive side,
presenting data that showed Pitt was
one of the best defensive teams in the
nation against the run, which forced
teams to constantly throw the ball.

“We gave up so many yards against
the pass last season because we were
so good against the run," Gottfried
said. “Pitt was really tough to run
against. We gave up only 2.2 yards per
rush. Teams had to pass the ball
because they couldn’t run."

With defensive coordinator John Fox
installing a 4-3 defensive front (op-
posed to the 5-2 in past years), Gott-

A Page 15

fried is conﬁdent some pressure will be
off the defensive backs with a consis-
tent pass rush.

In Monday’s scrimmage, Fox’s new
scheme was successful, shutting down
Gottfried’s newly styled, pass-happy
offense.

“The defense got the better of this
scrimmage,” Gottfried admitted.
“They were sluggish at times. but they
had the better day. The offense wasn’t

believes that with added strength comes
a stronger finish, and it cannot hurt his
start much, either.

“l think with more weight training,
I will have a better stan and a better
finish.“ McRae said.

His ultimate goal. for the time be»
ing. is to win the NCAA outdoor 100»
meter dash. Last spring, be advanced
to the finals but was disqualified for
jumping before the gun. Witnesses still
contend that McRae did not false start.

“He had proved earlier that he be—
longed. “ Pitt track coach John Vasvary
said. “He was just denied a chance to
show the people what he could do."

He gets a second chance this spring.
Pitt opens the outdoor season this
Saturday with the Panther Relays at Pitt
Stadium. and he already has his plan
of attack laid out.

The Pitt News, April 4, I986

McRae said he wants to run the
l()()-meters in l().l or 10.2 seconds
consistently throughout the outdoor
season.

“That will get me to the NCAA
finals," he said with a smile.

Then he will have his chance to erase
the ineiuory of the false start last
spring.

“It was just a freshman mistake."
said McRae. “I still say. to this day,
that I did not ‘jump. but that is the way
it is in the books. l aui going down
there with the same attitude l’ll get
out when l hear the gun. and ll it’s
good. it‘s good.“

Vasvary expects McRae to return in
grand fashion.

“The thing that happened there was
not going to stand in his way." Vas—
vary said. "He had so many great

things ahead of him. When it happened.

we told him we still loved him. He
was a freshman, and we knew he was
going to be back. He just learned a lit

tle lesson, and he is going to be that
nitich tougher because of it."

Pitt's last NCAA champion, hurdler
Roger Kingdom, went on to win an
Olympic gold medal in l.os Angeles.
Will McRae follow in l\'ingdom‘s path"
There is a strong possibility he will.

"I am definitely looking forward to
the I088 Olympics in Seoul.“ McRae
said. "I cannot say what the outcome
will be. but I do know what I want the
outcome to be "

McRae qualified for the ()l_\mpic
trials when he was in high school. but
a hamstring iiuury kept him lroiu com
peting. He always knew his day would
come; it was gust a matter of time.

“I knew it was within my grasp

when l was in high school.“ McRae

I see it

By Jim Brueekner

Baseball memories: Oh so sweet

Memories.

Perhaps when Barbra Streisand
sang about memories, in the theme
song from the movie “The Way We
Were." she captured the essence of
something that we all experience the
magic of memories.

Memories cannot be bought or sold.
They just happen. They are an integral
part of life. We learn from them. and
we fall back on them during times of
despair.

Baseball has provided billions of
memories for billions of people.

I learned how to play baseball dur-
ing the summer of 1969. From that mo-
ment on. a large majority of my life
has been devoted to exploring the many
joys of the summer game. About 90
percent of the memories that l have of
my childhood are connected with base-
ball. And that's a conservative
estimate.

I remember first employing the head-
first slide at the age of six. I found
that you could get to a base faster and
lower that way. To this day. I can't
understand why anyone would slide iii-
to second on a steal attempt using the
conventional slide. Considering how
many of these plays are the “bang-
bang" type with every fraction of a
second vital, you would think that all
runners would want the advantages of
the head—first slide.

But then again. baseball players are
not noted for being logical  or nor-
mal. lor that matter.

()ne other thing I remember about
baseball (that still holds true today) is
that when I played Little League. the
top players in the league were the same
kids who were the most unusual. There
are always exceptions. but nio.st base-
ball players are a little goofy". You haye
to be to let someone fire this hard. lit-
tle. round ball at you while you swing
at it with a stick. All sports have their
flakes, but in baseball. everyone's a lit-
tle weird. Remember Mark Fidrych.
the Tigers’ phenom pitcher who used
to talk to the ball and groom the mound
because the groundskeepers didn‘t do
a good enough job’? Well. he wasn‘t
the only one. The only difference is.
he made it to the big leagues. and I
never did.

Speaking of the big leagues, I be-
came an avid Pirate fan just in time.
The first season that I followed the
Pirates was 1971.

At that time. Steve Carlton was still
a Cardinal. and Nolan Ryan was still
a Met. American League pitchers still
batted. and Bill Mazeroski was still see-
ing part-time action as the Pirates‘ sec-
ond baseman.

Mal, wasn't the only holdover from

I

an The Beautiful Han

the 1960 world championship team.
however. A kid who had been deemed
a future superstar in I960 was, in
1971. arguably the best player in the
game. Roberto Clemente was appro-
priately nicknamed “The Great One."

There have been a number of great
hitters in baseball history. Clemente
was one of the most consistent hitters
of his or any era. but in reality. he
was not among the very best ofall time-_

Placing him among the lower end of

the top 5() would be more realistic.

It is another part of his game that I

will never forget. No. I didn‘t see Mays
in his prime. And Tris Speaker was
around before I was even born. But
one can make a very good case for
Roberto Clemente being the absolute
greatest defensive outﬁelder in diamond
history. For two years, I marveled at his
grace. speed and legendary ami. I used
to get chills every time an opposing
batter hit the ball his way. You knew
that anything hit in his direction was
catchable.

There is one specific memory that l
have about Clemente that perhaps best
sums up his awesome defensive talent:
In the early '70s. you saw a lot of in-
stances when players would try to
stretch singles into doubles. But if
anyone dared try this bold move against
Clemente. I was actually shocked that
he had the guts to try.

A lot of players tried to beat the
Pirates in l97l. but few succeeded
they won the World Series by beating
the ()rioles four games to three.

It was a memorable team that took
the field for the Pirates in the early
'70s.

There was burly Bob Robertson at
first base. sporting those huge foreanns
and long sideburns. Bob was one of on-
ly three players (Willie Stargell and
Greg Luzinski being the others) to hit
a home run in the vicinity of “peanut
heaven." Who can forget his missing
the bunt signal in the ‘'71 series, only
to connect for a three—run homer?

Dave Cash and Bill Mazeroski were
splitting time at second base. but Ren-
nie Stennett was the heir apparent. He
was one of the most acrobatic men to
ever play that position. I'll never for-
get how he used to stop those ground
balls that were hit up the middle and
had “base-hit" written all over them
and throw the batters out at first with-
out even setting himself up to throw.
He made more off—balance throws than
anyone I've seen yet. and almost all
were dead-eye accurate.

Pittsburgh has seen a lot of shonstops
come and go since then. most notably
Gene Alley. During the '60s. Ma‘: and
Alley were regarded as the best dou-

ble play combination in baseball. ()f

what I saw of Alley. I can see why.

How can anyone forget Richie Heb-
ner'.’ Whenever he wasn‘t keeping us
impressed by his steady bat. there
were always stories about his father's
grave-digging business or his female
following. But most memorable was
the way he was constantly tugging at
his shin whenever he stepped up to the
plate.

There are a lot of memories about
Willie Stargell. most still fresh in
everyone‘s mind. But here's one I'll
bet a lot of people have forgotten. I'm
not sure if it was Game I or Game 2.
but how many ofyou remember Willie
trying to climb the fence twice in one
game of the '7l Series. going after
Oriole home runs‘? Grace was not his
forte. nor speed. which was evident
years later when he signaled for a time-
out in the middle of a steal attempt.

Stargell stealing was about as smart
as a pitcher throwing a fastball to
Richie Zisk. Zisk hammered fastballs
and almost killed himself while trying
to go after the breaking balls. His every
at—bat was an adventure.

What more can be said about Al
Oliver‘? Personally. I think that he has
a few years left. and any team would
be wise to try to talk him out of retire-
ment. He‘d make a great No. 1 pinch
hitter for any team. I‘d like to see
him back in Pittsburgh. but that would
be too good to be true.

The pitchers provided some memo-
rable moments too. Remember how it
used to rain whenever Nellie Briles was
scheduled to pitch‘? ()r how Bob Moose
used to fall down after pitches.’ ()r how
Luke Walker once went ()-39 before
finally getting a base—hit‘.’

But what really’ makes these memo-
ries stand out is the man who relayed
them to the public. Bob Prince. I saved
the best for last.

There will never be another Bob
Prince. No one will ever come close.
There was no such thing as a boring
game with him behind the microphone.
I could go on and on about him, but
I will simply say that he was the very
best his ﬁeld has ever produced.

The currrent Pirates are suffering
because of the memories of Pirate fans.
We are spoiled. Take it easy on these
new guys. Give them a chance. There
could be another superstar ready to
provide us with some new memories.

Until then. we still have the old ones.

“Here‘s the one-one pitch to Star-
gell. There's a long ﬂy ball. deep to
right field! He's going back! Way back!
You . can  kiss it goodbye!!!
Chicken on the Hill with Will!“

Tennis win streak ends

By Gregg F ieery
Staff Writer

The Pitt men‘s tennis team trounced
area opponents from Slippery Rock and
St. Francis earlier this week but ran in-
to a runaway freight train in the form
ofthe Mountaineers of West Virginia.
losing yesterday in a late afternoon
match in Morgantown. The loss
snapped the Panthers’ three-inatch win-
ning streak and evened their record at
6-6.

Coach George Dieffenbach had
guaranteed that his team would be on
top of their games for West Virginia.
but the “backyard brawl" turned out
to be more ofa sidewalk scuffle as the
Mountaineers, who are slowly estab-
lishing themselves as a power in eastern
collegiate tennis. simply had too many
weapons for the Panthers to match.

“They're going to bring out the best
in us," said Dieffenbach before the
match. “Any time you play the
strongest team on your schedule.
you're going to be ready. but it’s go-
ing to take five separate upsets for us
to win the match. and that probability
is low."

Indeed. it is especially low when one
considers that the Mountaineers.
ranked in the top three in the Middle
States region. had just beaten perennial

powerhouse Penn State 5-4 in Happy
Valley last week. (Penn State. by the
way, refused to play the traditional
match against the Panthers this year on
the grounds that it was. in essence. not
worth their while.)

Earlier in the week. the Panthers’
performances against Slippery Rock
and St. Francis were a more reliable
barometer of how the squad is pro-
gressing this year. ()n Tuesday in Slip-
pery Rock. the team powered their way
to an impressive 8-I victory over an
almost identical Rock squad which the
Panthers barely edged last year 5-4
the only difference being the absence
of both of last year's No. I players
(Slippery Rock's to graduation and
Pitt's Dave Johnson to an injury).

“We pounded a good team up
there," said Dieffenbach. “We won all
of our three setters, and that has been
our main drawback all year long."

Freshman Neil Meyerowieh (No. 2)
and sophomore Greg Campbell (No. 3)
each pulled through to score three set
singles wins for the Panthers. which.
combined with four other straight set
triumphs. led to a sweep of singles play
and clinched the victory.

A 9-() win over St. Francis on
Wednesday was expected. but it was
satisfying nevertheless. It was the type
of match in which you want to win
every point just because you think you

should. The Panthers were not serious-
ly threatened in any of the matches_

“They were definitely the weakest
team wc’ve played this year," said
I)ieffenbaeh. Not the type of team you
like to play before playing west
Virginia.

The Panthers will resume play with
a four-day. four-match homestand
beginning with neighborhood rival
(‘arnegie—Mellon on Monday at 3 pm_
at Trees Courts.

I-\

N()'l‘ES: No. 3 player Dave
Johnson, who was leading the team in
wins before injuring his ankle in a
challenge match two weeks ago, is ex-
pected to return to the lineup for next
week's matches. according to Coach
[)ieffenbach. Johnson will probably be
inserted at the No. 6 position for the
remaining six matches.

off what could be considered their best
indoor season in a long time. They
came out of nowhere and ended up
finishing fourth in the Big East. In ad-
dition. they sent athletes to the Eastern
Championships for the first time in at
least two years.

This weekend will see both the men
and women hosting the Panther Relays
here at Pitt. The meet is basically a
steppingstone in preparation for all of
the other competitions that both the
men and the women are going to lace
latcr this year. Both coaches are not
putting much emphasis on the meet; in
stead they are tising it to take a look
at their athletes and see where they will
fit into the syslcm of things in terms
ofthe outdoor season. It is meant to be
a fun meet. giving all those involved
a chance to relax a little before the
pressure of the big meets once again
begins to build up.

Both the men and the women had a
very successful indoor season. and they
are hoping to do even better during the
outdoor season. The men have more of

strengths, which lie in the sprints. Therm

men. who looked like world beatersi
during the winter. now have their en-
tire team ready to run. and it looks as
though they will be able to live up to
expectations during the spring. There
is the possibility that Pitt could have a
Big East champion this year if the
whole team is able to stay healthy.

Stottlemyer happy
with EWL honor

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

People who make a difference.

It's not necessarily the heroes who
make a difference but those who simply
do their job — and do it well. Quite
often their accomplishments and talents
are over looked.

This past week, one such individual's
accomplishments were not ignored.
Pitt’s Rande Stottlemyer was named
co—winner of the EWL Coach of the
Year award by his peers.

“It's a really nice honor to be award-
ed," said Stottlemyer. “This should be
shared by everybody. The assistant
coaches and the team itself had a hand
in this as well."

There were many who helped Pitt
regain national prominence this season,
but none was more visible than Coach
Stottlemyer. It took seven long seasons
for the Panther wrestling program to
shake through the cobwebs. Finally,
under Stottlemyer's guidance. they
emerged as a legitimate Eastern
contender.

This season, Stottlemyer & Com-
pany scratched and clawed their way
to a 9-3-2 record. capping off the year
with two All-Americas — Kyle Nellis
and Pat Santoro. Though it was to be
Pitt's rosiest season since the '79 team
finished I3-4, there were many pro-
blems that had to be solved.

“When I came in as the coach, it was
a very hard time adjusting,” said Stot-
tlemyer. “My first season, I was
coaching kids I [had as] teammates in
previous years.

“I didn‘t know anything about
recruiting [or], for that matter, about
coaching itself. It was very difficult in
the beginning.”

Since those trying and often
frustrating early years, Stottlemyer has
grown with the program. Stottlemyer
admits he's had support from the ad-
ministration. Regardless, it takes a
fighter and a survivor to come out on
top. Both adjectives describe Stot-
tlemyer well.

Many others might have quit during
those early days, but this is one guy
who will not quit. Even now in the off-
season, Stottlemyer works long and
hard trying to lure prosective talent to
Pitt.

Through it all. even Stottlemyer has
needed a crutch to lean on. His wife
Regina (who is expecting their second
child). and I4-month—0ld daughter
Tara, provide the support his chosen
profession demands.

“I’ve really had the support at home
[of] a good wife." said Stottlemyer.
‘‘It‘s this off-season recruiting time that
takes the biggest toll. But, I do have
my family to go home to. I love being
a father, and I try to spend as much
time with my family as I can."
