The issue of cultural diversity in high-
er education has recently been a popular
issue for discussion, but many people
talk about it without being sure what to
do about it.

At a lecture yesterday sponsored by
the University of Pittsburgh Challenge
for Excellence Programs ,(UCEP),
Professor Edmund Gordon not only dis-
cussed the importance of this issue, but
also offered his views for solutions.

Gordon, a professor emeritus of psy-

the challenges that universities face in
their attempts for academic excellence,
cultural diversity and social equality.

Gordon said he sees the subjects of
academics, diversity and equality not
only as human rights, but also as neces-
sary for the structural support of soci-
ety.

“The conjoining of universities’ com-
_mitments to honor the characteristics of
our diverse peoples and the pursuit of
academic excellence is not only one of
the moral imperatives of our time, it is
also a required condition for the contin-

Conferences sharpen SEAC's vision

By Jennifer McGinnis
_.lt_lff Writer

Pitt’s Student Environmental Action
Coalition is sharpening its vision of
what wilderness should be.

Members of SEAC and the
Allegheny Defense Project (ADP)
attended a Central Appalachian Forest
Activist Conference in Clifton, Va.
last weekend. The conference was
sponsored by Preserve Appalachian
Wilderness (PAW) and brought envi-
ronmental organizations together to
design a strategy for wilderness pro-
tection.

“PAW, ADP, Buckeye Forest
Council and Virginians for Wilderness

attended the conference,” said Susan
Curry of SEAC. “We were working to
form an alliance between the groups,
hashing out our visions, strategies and
goals.”

Jim Kleissler, of Philadelphia’s
SEAC, described the group's vision as
“Big Wild Wilderness.”

“We want to recreate what was once
there from what we have now,”
Kleissler said.

“There were a lot of older people at
the conference who have been forest
activists for years,” Curry said.
“People always say ‘You’ll get burned
out, this is just a phase,’ but these
people have been activists for years_

Councilman
seeks advice
from Pitt

Democrats

By Ed Abolins
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh City Councilman Bob
O’Connor sought some advice from
Pitt students at last night’s
University Democrats meeting.

O’Connor asked students how
they felt about current proposals in
citygovernment dealing with the
issues of cracking down on panhan-
dlers and imposing a curfew on
minors in the city of Pittsburgh.

Most University Democrats pre-
sent at the meeting were either
undecided on the issues or against
the proposals.

University Democrats’ Vice
President Eric Schultz was one of
the few in the group that supported
the idea of greater restrictions on
panhandlers.

“I think it would do wonders for
Pitt, and the image of Pittsburgh, if
panhandlers weren’t around,” said
Schultz.

City Council is expected to
debate both issues in the coming
weeks, and O’Connor is currently
formulating his views on proposals
to restrict the activities of panhan-
dlers and to impose a curfew on
minors.

He questioned why a juvenile
would need to be on the street on a '
weeknight after a prescribed time.

But, O’Connor also said he
believed there might be problems
with correctly identifying whether
or not a person is a juvenile if they
are not carrying identification. He
also foresaw problems with devel-
oping sanctions for, and applying
them to, curfew violations.

Singling out people suspected of
panhandling also posed a problem
for O’Connor. “If you do pick up
the person, can you get them help?”
he asked.

TOKYO — Police still have
no suspects or motives regard-
ing the nerve gas attack in the
subway system in Tokyo,
Japan.

Officials reported that the
attack, which killed eight and
injured as many as 5,000,, was
organized carefully. Five trains
on three target lines were
selected during rush hour
when the destination of the
trains was Kasumigaseki sta-
tion.

The city of Kasumigaseki is

JERUSALEM — Palestinian
automobiles have been banned
by Israel from the Gaza Strip.
The ban was in part the result
of the police seizure of a truck

checked a parked truck that
looked suspicious and a fight
started between the police and
the Arab occupants of the

Pitt students choose to help others over spring break

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

Santo Domingo, shelters,
volunteering and impover-
ished communities are not
words or images that the aver-
age Pitt student conjures up
when thinking about spring
break.

For many students spring

break means beaches, tans and

parties, but for a small num-
ber of students at Pitt it signi-
fies a chance to volunteer
their time to help the less for-
tunate.

Some members from two
campus clubs skipped the
usual Florida beach vacation

for an offered Alternative »

Spring Break.

Pitt’s Collegiate YMCA and
the Pitt Student Volunteer
Outreach program (formerly
known as the Center For
Student Community Service)
donated their spring break
timeto help build houses and
shelters as well as friendships.

Four members of the
Collegiate YMCA traveled to
Santo Domingo, the capitol of

‘ the Dominican Republic, to be

involved in a cultural
exchange and help refurbish‘ a
shelter.

The purpose of traveling to
the Dominican Republic was
“tovprovide community ser-
vice to people who are in need
in another culture,” said Sara
Moss, one alternative spring
breaker.

Although the Collegiate
YMCA has been going on
similar trips since its exis-
tence, this was its first inter-
national one. "

The students’ main project
was tearing down and rebuild-
ing a camp shelter that was
overrun with termites. The
shelter housed kids who have
found their way off drugs and
the streets or children whose
parents had abandoned them.

Since the students were
dealing with a Third World
country, their living condi-
tions were quite different then
those of the Florida vacation-
ers.

“I remember specifically
banging out every nail [from
the shelter] because they recy-
cle every single one. They
didn’t have the money to get
new ones so we had to dig
around in the dirt to make

sure we hadn’t missed any,”

said Moss.

‘For the first two nights of
the trip the volunteers stayed
with a host family in houses
without running water and
electricity most of the time.

“The waterand electricity

lla.m. to 4 p.m.

came on for a little bit in the
afternoon and a little in the
middle of the night. They
were available when you least
needed them,” said Moss.

“As soon as Lily [Jeng,
another student_ on the trip]
arrived to her host family’s
house they handed her a metal
pail and told her that was her
toilet,” Moss said.

Jeng said she remembers
not how impoverished the
families were but instead how
they played music all of the
time and found things to be
happy about.

“The thing that stood out
most for me was that since I
didn’t know any Spanish I
didn’t know how well I’d be

- able to communicate. [But] at

the end of the trip I felt really
close to the family without
having to speak the language.
Ifelt attached to them through
their actions and their sense of
humor,” said J eng.

On Friday of their trip, the
group went to Don Gregorio,

Whichever direction you decide to
take, we can help you get there in style,
with a brand new Ford or Mercury.

If you're a graduating senior, or a graduate student,
you can get $400 Cash Back or a Special A.P.R’.“*

or be enrolled in graduate school, between 1/

a YMCA school about two
hours outside of Santo
Domingo. The school is the
only school around and if the
children don’t go there, they
don’t go to school. The people
are so poor that many of the
children don’t wear pants or
underwear and none of them
have shoes.

Besides rebuilding the shel-
ter the students were also
there to be involved in a cul-
tural exchange. They took
gifts, clothes, school supplies
and candy to give to the chil-

, dren.

“One student
Washington University of St.
Louis brought bubbles. It’s

funny how something so sim-'

ple can make them so happy,”
said Moss. “We taught them
the peace sign and they loved
getting their picture taken.”
Members from the Pitt
Student Volunteer Outreach
joined 12 other schools and
125 volunteers in Appalachian
Kentucky to renovate and

from ,

rebuild low-income homes for
families and the elderly.

For Molly Mulhern, pro-
gram director, the most mean-
ingful thing for her was work-
ing with an unemployed
father and his family building
a house.

“It must have been very
humbling to have people
come in and help you out,”
said Mulhem. “When we left
they wanted our address and
gave us theirs because they
wanted to send pictures and
keep in touch. Even though
we were only there for four
days there was a bond
formed.”

All of the volunteers were
placed into groups with peo-
ple from other schools and
then scattered throughout 13
different work sites. They
worked right alongside the
people for whom the houses
were being built. The Pitt stu-
dents built a total of two new
houses from the ground up,
replaced many windows and

doors and even had to pick up

and move an entire house

after building it because the
ground it was on began to
sink.

. For the first few days the
students.weren’t installing
windows the best way and had
to redo them later.

“The whole reason we were
there was to build the houses
and I figured I’d gain some
stuff like friendships on the
side, b.ut in actuality it didn’t
happen that way. In one
aspect, the houses ended up
being the least important
thing,” said Laura Beecher.

Although this was the
Student Volunteer Outreach’s
first trip of this kind they said
they hope it will be a spring-
board for future similar trips.

In relation to both groups
and their trips, Mulhem said it
best when she said, ”Even if
[the volunteers and the.fami-
lies] don’t keep in touch, it
will always be something
we’ll remember.”

Speaker discusses reasons for pro-Iite activism

By David Palmer
lﬂur Ilhe Iﬁttlvewvs

Mary Beddingfield addressed the
Students for Life Monday on the rea-
sons why she believes pro-life activism
is important and what is involved in
being a pro-life activist.

“Abortion destroys the most innocent
and helpless beings of our society,”
said Beddingfield, who has been a pro-
life activist for the past 11 years.

Beddingfield outlined several reasons
for pro-life activism. She said the first

thing pro—lifers must realize is that I

actions speak louder than words.

“We need to realize that we can make
a difference by providing education and
support to troubled women,” said
Beddingfield.

She said pro-life activists are the
Oskar Schindlers of today because it’s
up to them to stop the senseless slaugh-
tering of innocent lives.

“We know when and where the

 

killings are done. All we need to do is
look inside of ourselves and realize that
we are the answer,” said Beddingfield.

She also said being actively involved
in the pro-life movement snowballs an
individual into awareness of things
such as politics, governmental and
prison reforms and the plight of the
homeless.

The most important reason for a per-
son to be a pro-life activist, said
Beddingfield, is that they are America’s
final and last hope to save the country
from suffering the fate all other coun-
tries have already.

Beddingfield told the Students for
Life what happens outside of an abor-
tion clinic and the different things an
activist can do.

The activities can be as simple as car-
rying a picket sign, which Beddington
said can be powerful and carry great
conviction.

Other activities include prayer sup-
port, handing out leaﬂets and brochures

to the public and sidewalk counsel.
Another activity that only men usually
participate in is being a gideon.

“A gideon protects the other pro-lif-
ers from being injured by the escorts
who often times become physical with
the female activists,” said Beddingfield.

The focus of pro-life activism in the
Pittsburgh area are on two abortion
clinics in East Liberty and one located
Downtown.

“If there’s no doubt in your mind that
you are doing the right thing, being an
activist is easy, no matter what happens
to you,” said Beddingfield.

She said the programs like Project
Multitude, which is a monthly trip to
clinics, and Life Chain, which is an
annual event, are not enough because
over 4,400 children die each day.

“Standing against abortion is not a
particular ministry nor a specific call-
ing; it is the normal, Christian response
to the innocent being dragged off to
slaughter,” said Beddingfield.

Distinguished
professor
captivates
students

By Tara Munkatchy
§gg[7'lV?iter

“Teaching is my priority,”
according to Pitt Professor
Ted Windt, who teaches
Presidential Rhetoric and is
one of the Chancellor's
Distinguished Teachers at
I’itt.

“It’s always challenging
to make the material inter-
esting,” Windt said.

Windt must be a good
“spin doctor” because.he’s
been teaching at Pitt for 25
years, has authored several
books — the most recent
being “Presidents
Proteste_rs: Political
Rhetoric in the 1960’s” —
and his class is well known
for being filled during the
first days of registration.

“One of the things that

,has occurred recently has

been the rise of presidential
rhetoric as an integral part
of presidential governing. A
number of books are being
written in this media age on
this subject,” Windt said.
“Most of us in the public
get our information from
public sources, or from

I presidential statements.”

“I learned so much from
[Windt] it was amazing,”
said former student Susan
Brozek, who currently
works for WTAE-TV.
“What I learned really
allowed me to begin ana-
lyzing my speeches, which
helps me at my job today.”

Presidential Rhetoric
allows students to interpret
messages about the speaker,
‘policy and even their own
future from the information
they receive. ‘

“It helps students assume
political responsibility,”
said Windt. «

“His style, manner of
teaching was superior in
every way,” Brozek said.
“[Windt] is an excellent
professor. There were days

‘when there wasn’t a seat

left in the classroom, and I
would sit on the floor in the
aisle.”

In one ‘word, Brozek
described Windt’s class as
‘captivating.’

Windt said he didn’t
always know teaching was
his calling.

“I never really had an
ambition to be a teacher,”

he said. “But it’s something ‘

I enjoyed.”

He said he was deeply
influenced by his own
teachers at Texas Lutheran
College, at Bowling Green
State University and at
Ohio State.

“Teachers make a real
impact on your life. It
seemed natural to go into

and they are pretty hard-

‘ core. They have some radi-

cal ideas. It was inspiring.”

Curry noted that all four
speakers on the keynote
panel were men and said
that created some friction at
the conference.

“I felt a weird feeling of
exclusion (at the confer-
ence), and other women felt
it too,” Curry said. “All the
speeches used masculine
examples and 1anguage..I
am certain it was not done
intentionally, but a lot of
people expressed frustration
over this.”

Various people spoke on
the importance of gender
balancing within the envi-
ronmental movement, and
the importance of- the
processes used to achieve
environmental goals was
discussed.

“That was one of the best
thingsthat came out of this
weekend,” Curry said. “We
faced problems within the
movement and are working
together to change those
feelings.”

“We need to look at some
of the negative roles that
society puts women into and
try to do something about it
within our group,” Kleissler
said._, “Every perspective is
rimportanrt .to .o.bt.a_in our
goals in the best way.”

The conference featured
educational sl_ide_shows,
guest speakers and work-
shops on various topics
from Appeals and Grant
Writings ._;:to  Wildilands
Mapping to Community
Education.

SEAC member Matt
Peters said he attended a
similar conference at Otter
Park in
Kentucky two weeks ago.
The conference was spon-
sored by Heartwood, a mid-
western environmental
group. A

“Heartwood is made up of
farmers, landowners, and
people from all walks of life
who are trying to establish a
wildlands vision,” Peters
said. ,

The first part of the
conference dealt with
appeals and litigation, giv-
ing participants ideas on
how to become more
involved in public input
activities, Peters said. The
second part focused on
mapping issues.

“We made a wish list of
bio-sensitive areas that need
to be protected,” Peters
said.

SEAC will be attending
another Heartwood confer-
ence May 26—29 in Hinton,
W. Va.. Also, from April 15
to May 15 the Buckeye
Forest Council will be pre-
senting a strip-mining road
show with speakers, slide
presentations and musical
groups. The show will go
through Ohio, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, New York
and Kentucky.

teaching,” he said.

He began teaching theater and directed some plays.
Eventually, he made the choice to move into rhetoric, the
field he continues to teach today.

Windt received the Eastern Communication Association’s
highest award for scholarship, the Everett Lee Hunt Award,
back-to-back during’ the years of 1991 and 1992.

Windt’s office is filled with videotapes, books about and
posters of Richard Nixon, who recently passed away.

“I miss Richard Nixon,” Windt said, “A fascinating presi-
dent whose psychological complexity comes through, espe-

cially in his speeches, regardless of what you thought of.
' his presidency.” -

There is a definite influence of President John F.
Kennedy in his office as well.

“Kennedy and political television came of age together.”
Windt himself has been political commentator on
“Weekend Magazine” on KDKA-TV for the past nine
years.

Brozek said she regrets that she’s “not in school today to
hear what he has to say about recent presidents. I really
feel like I’m missing something.” a

What does he think about President Clinton?

“He’s not doing enough [rhetoric]. One of the major
precedents of presidents is to define agenda —— that’s
important. President Clinton has allowed himself to be
defined by other people. The whole conglomerate of radio
talk shows setting his definition does not work to his

: advantage.”

ion either for or against the proposals, but in trying to get
student input into local matters he remained true to his belief
that political involvement is necessary for any person that
wants to see action taken on issues.

“One major problem all over this country is that nobody
gets involved with politics,” said O’Connor. “People who get
their way, whether they are right or wrong, are organized and
know how to lobby us.”

According to O’Connor, the best way to get your point of
view represented is to get in touch with local government
leaders. “Letters, complaints and lobbying all get across to
city council members,” he said.

Diversity

°From page I
the difficulty when we brought them in
in larger numbers,” Gordon said.

Gordon also said that though bringing
in those large numbers of minority stu-
dents would provide a hospitable envi-
ronment for education and a community
where they can work together, it could
produce a problem if they are not prop-
erly prepared for higher education.

“If the efflux of the spirit of that criti-
cal mass of students is not directed
toward academic achievements but
towards some other kinds of things, the
very presence of the critical mass itself
can get in the way,” Gordon said.

The professor stressed the term
“development” in the structure of devel-
opmental education and diversity pro-
grams.

“The reason that I include ‘develop-
ment’ is that it suggests the potential,
the human potential, the human capaci-
ties for change, for growth, for expan-
sion,” Gordon said. “And if we define
ourselves as educators  it’s about
expanding, about improving, about opti-
mizing human capacity. So the develop-
ment piece of our field is critical.”

Gordon said he believes that opportu-
nities for advancement and education
are not enough. He suggested that
developmental education provide assis-

tance to students so that they have the
ability to take advantage of those oppor-
tunities. _

“If I had to define  developmental
education, [it] is the guidance and medi-
ation of teaching and learning transac-
tions in ways that insure successful
development, or optimal development,
of specific populations of students in
need,” Gordon said.

He stressed the importance of the stu-
dent in this process, and said he
believes they play an active role in their
education.

“[Developmental education] isn’t
something we only do for students, it is
something we enable students to do for
themselves,” Gordon said. “But many of
us need the help of a mediator. We need
the help of a teacher.”

Gordon said programs that follow_

those types of guidelines will insure
success, and allow minoritystudents to
take advantage of the opportunities
available to them.

He also said the wide range of effects
of a program should be looked at before
we can judge them. A

“We not only want to know what [ser-
vice] has been delivered to whom, but
we also want to know what the person
who received it thought that she was
receiving,”- Gordon said.

He acknowledged that a problem of
diversity and development in higher
education is a contradiction.

“We have these intellect-producing
institutions and these intellectuals who
are at one and the same time committed
to conserving, but at the same time
committed to radical change,” Gordon
said. “More of our less disenfranchised
people can’t be about conservation, they
can’t be about keeping things the way
they are. They have to be about radical
change.”

Gordon said he believes a large part
of developmental education is helping
minorities understand these contradic-
tions and get past them.

According to Gordon, diversity

‘among cultures should a11ow'under-

standing and allow them to interact with
each other.

“I don’t think we can be satisfied, be
content to simply know our own culture
and  be comfortable in it. [We] also
have to be able to deal with a lot of
other people’s cultures,” Gordon said.

The professor stressed the importance
of learning as a way to create strong
peoples of all backgrounds in a society.

“When we talk about intellectual
competence  that’s the source of
power,” Gordon said. “That’s the source
of human liberation.”

sex situations.

Some individuals con-
clude that a woman was
“asking for it” if sex was
forced on her while she was
passed out or because she
had been intoxicated. How
can something be asked for
in an unconscious state?
And, according to the
Pennsylvania Crimes Code,
forced sexual situations
include those in which the
victim is not able to give
consent or is unable to resist
due to alcohol or drugs
administered by the
assailant or with the knowl-
edge of the assailant.

Alcohol and drugs play a

significant role in sexual ‘

assaults. Responsible deci-
sions are compromised
while under the inﬂuence of
alcohol or drugs.
Intoxication inhibits effec-
tive communication and
active listening.
Responsible drinking is an
important ingredient in the
prevention of sexual
ex-ploitation.

Opinions
Move slow on NATO

Andrei Kozyrev, Russia’s foreign minister, warned that adding
new members to NATO from the former Eastern Bloc could cre-
ate a rift between Moscow and the members of the NATO
alliance. The New York Times quoted Kozyrev as saying “Why
rush things at the risk of creating new divisions?”

In light of recent Russian military action in Chechnya and
protests over the expansion of NATO, American and Western
relations with Russia have been. somewhat strained. It is impor-
tant not to alienate this developing area. Unlike other countries
in similar situations, the collapse of order in Russia would be a
catastrophe. As the situation now stands, anything resembling
civil order has a very tenuous grip in the former Soviet
republics. With ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky
vying for positions of power, and nuclear weapons kept under
questionable circumstances, making change move slowly is the
best policy concerning the states which have come out of the
Soviet Union.

At the same time, however, relations with Eastern Europe
must not be dictated by the whims of the Russian government. If
this is allowed, then it would be as if the Soviet Union had never
collapsed.

Last Tuesday, in a talk concerning the fu_ture security of
Europe, Phillip Thomas, an officer with the British embassy in
Washington D.C. made the point that a strategy must be devel-
oped to deal with the emerging nations .of central Europe
(Poland, Hungary, the Ukraine). They must not be left as pawns
on a political chess board between the European Union in the
west and Russia in the east. These sort of tensions will lead to
security and economic troubles throughout Europe.

Kozyrev called for the creation of a new, all encompassing
alliance, according to The New York Times, which will deal with
issues of overall -European security. The argument for a new
alliance is strong. NATO itself is rapidly becoming little more
than a paper tiger. Its use in Bosnia shows that either NATO
does not have the ability to be effective in its own sphere of

I inﬂuence, or that the European Union lacks the political will to

use it.

A comprehensive alliance, which would also include Russia,
is not the way to go either. The nations of Europe cannot be
integrated into the alliance until they reach an economic and
social level which gives them common interests with the
European Community. They must be able to integrate within the
family of nations as it were.

It is important that the President and the Congress do not prac-
tice a Chamberlain-like policy of appeasement toward Russia.

Maintaining the stability of Europe, while also keeping Russia
from being completely alienated must be the main goal of any
policy. So, due caution must be exercised in the expansion of
NATO, but this caution should take into account the various
complexities of the European situation, not the whims of
Russian leaders.

Politicians ignore the real threats

/ V f all the
 p 1' 0 b -
lems in

America that
are mentioned
by both parties,
the threat to

 our democrat-
Tony ic system is
Dickensheets S"‘d°‘“’ ‘f

ever, men-

tioned. It should be because
it is a major problem that is
getting worse. Neither party
wants to discuss this problem
because they both are con-
tributors to the current
atmosphere of political apa-
thy that exists throughout the
nation.

Political apathy in the US I
has been getting progressive-
ly worse since the 1960s. The
reasons for this are many, but
two of the main ones appear

V to be linked together. They is

an overall decline in the
integrity of our political lead-
ers and the evolution of the
mass media which allows
more of the public to be
exposed to the negative cam-
paign ads along with a con-
stant stream of political pos-
turing and lies. This sort of
behavior by the politicians
and the apathy of the voters
(only 38% bothered to vote
in the ‘94 mid-terms) clearly
threatens our political sys-
tem.

For all of the preaching
that the US government does
about the promotion of
“human rights” and democra-
tic political systems around
the world, it seems to me that
they haven’t done a very
good job at sustaining
democracy in our own coun-
try. As I see it, there are two
major problems with ourrt
political system. The first is
the myth of the US being a
“representative democracy”
and the second is the undeni-
able fact that our political
system, in its present form, is
unable to solve many of the
nation’s most serious prob-
lems.

Although I don’t think
many.politicians in D.C.
would admit it, this is exactly
why many Republicans and
Democrats (don’t forget that
many liberals flip-flopped
from their vote last year)
wanted a Constitutional
amendment to balance the
budget. They were smart
enough to know that capital
pork and special interest lob-
bies prevent them from limit-
ing spending unless forced to
do so by Constitutional law.

It is . not accurate to
describe the US political sys-
tem as a “representative
democracy.” I would describe
it as an aristocracy that
throws some crumbs to the
voting masses every few
years at election time. When
Republican presidential can-
didate Phil Gramm boasts
that a candidate needs at least
$20 million to buy -—— oops, I
mean win — the presidency,
he is not exaggerating.
Money, not Jeffersonian val-
ues, is what rules our current
political system. This is
why 94% of the incumbents
from both parties routinely
“win” re-election. Even in
the so-called ‘94 mid-term
“revolution” 90% of incum-
bents were sent back to the
capital. p

This money-system warps
our democracy in two ways.
First, it is indisputable that
this system severely limits
who can run for political
office. Secondly, since politi-
cians receive the bulk of their
money from individual con-
tributors and large corpora-
tions, once they take office
their votes are clearly swayed
by the policies that their con-
tributors want pursued. Why
else would special interest
lobbies give money to both
political parties? Clearly they
feel that they are getting their
money's worth. The media
calls it the status quo, I call it
vote buying.

The second problem
involves the public. With

politicians campaigning year-
round throughout their
career, they are obviously
concerned about public opin-
ion. This is why pollsters
have so much inﬂuence and
Congress gets so little
accomplished.Most
Americans are in favor of
balancing the‘ budget until
they find out that in order to
do so entitlements such as
Social Security and Medicaid
will have to be cut. Then
there are the politicians who
for years have been too
cowardice to cut overbloat-
ed agricultural subsidies. In
this respect, our democratic
system has become a danger-
ous hindrance to solving
many of our nation’s prob-
lems.

It has also created our
current short-term, let some-
body else pay attitude that is
so pervasive in American
society. The AARP is the
posterchild of this ideology.
This is the reason why no
politician from either party
will admit the obvious fact
that Social Security must be
on the table (and cut) in any
discussion of balancing the
budget. . '

Another flaw in our politi-
cal system is that politicians
have full autonomy to make
laws. that affect their conduct.
For example, by all polls
Americans of both parties
overwhelmingly support term
limits and campaign finance
reform. Congress will never
pass either term limits or real
campaign finance reform
because that would mean
ending their own careers and
cutting off their money sup-
ply.

For these reasons I expect
voter participation to contin-
ue to decline and our form
of democracy to become
even more endangered. I
guess we'll worry about it
when it becomes a crisis. _

among other moot points that

He returned for the love of

baseball is ridiculous. One
seems to forget that he is the

doesn’t need any more

Nike, he has more money

And let’s all shed a tear for
Dickey Simpkins. Here is a

essentially a practice dummy.

Georgetown overpowers wom

By Jim Wheeler
For The Pitt News

The women’s tennis team
traveled Saturday to play Big
East. foe Georgetown. Even
with the loss of ‘the Hoyas’
No.1 and No. 2 players,
Georgetown defeated the
Lady Panthers 6-1.

The Lady Panthers were
overpowered, losing all three
doubles matches. The closest
set came from Alison Baker
and Tammy Keister, who lost
9-7.

In doubles, three matches
are played, and the team
which wins two out of three
receives the one team point.

“I thought we had a good
chance to defeat them,” said
coach George Dieffenbach.
“The No. 1 doubles match and
the No. 2 doubles match were
very close. I think we could
have won, both of those
matches, but we were unable
to do so because of errors.”

“I think Georgetown was a
great experience for us,” said
Baker. “I think everyone
played very well despite the
scores. I think it gave us con-
fidence that we can play
against a Big East team when
we go down to Miami to play
in the Big East Tournament.”

In singles action, Pitt
received its only point from

Baker, playing at the No. 1
spot. She defeated Laura
Schoellkoph 7-6, 3-6, 6-2.

Losing the rest of the sin-
gles matches were Fran Davis
(6-2, 6-2), Marla Zelenski (6-
1, 6-1), Tamara Kalesnik (6-0,
6-3). and Tammy Keister (6-1,
6-2).

The No. 6 seed, Kristin
Siegel, suffered a close loss to
Mary McNally 5-7, 6-3, 7-6.

“I think our team is really
improving,” said Siegel. “We
played well
Georgetown who in the past
has been a more dominant
team. This year even though
we didn’t win, we had a lot of
close matches.”

“We had a good win from
Alison Baker at No.1 and a
close loss from Kristin Siegel
at No. 6,” said Dieffenbach.
“That goes to show that over-
all we were closely matched
with the Georgetown team.

“We had too many errors.
We will work harder this
week to reduce our errors. If
we can reduce our errors and
become more consistent we’ll
be more competitive in the

future with teams such as _ 1

Georgetown. The team needs
to not get discouraged and
work "hard in practice to
reduce our errors before our
next Big East opponents.”

This college athlete doesn't
receive ‘special treatment‘

An introspective
look at a week
in the lite of
Pitt baseball's
Rob Garvey

By Brett Fondrk
Senior Staff Writer

(Editor’s Note: This arti-
cle was written prior to the
start of the baseball sea-
son.)

Many students at Pitt are
undeniably jealous of ath-
letes. They feel that colle-
giate players get special
treatment that regular stu-
dents are not entitled to.
Sometimes it looks like the
university will pull some
strings and do anything to
keep the athlete in school
so they can play their
respective sport.

What the detractors of
college athletes do not
know, is what the life of a
college athlete isreally
like. The truth is, they work
hard even in the off-season.
And despite the fact they

devote an allotted amount
of time each week to their
sport, they are not much
different from most stu-
dents.

I took the time to attempt
to dispel the stereotype of
the college athlete. I fol-
lowed around Pitt baseball
player Rob Garvey for a

ull school week. Garvey is
a sophomore first baseman
on half-scholarship.

What I found was that
Rob is just like the average
student. The difference was
that he had to devote a por-
tion of his week to baseball.
I found no evidence of spe-
cial treatment or favoritism
as I followed Rob from
class to class.

MONDAY: Rob wakes up
around 9 a.m. and showers.
He has political science in
David Lawrence at 10 a.m.
Living in Sutherland, he
has a nice walk ahead him.
To his credit, he made it to
class although he looked to
be half asleep. The class is
a long, boring, lecture. I
watched Rob as his eyes
flickered shut four or five
times throughout the ordeal.

Next on his schedule is
algebra recitation which is
followed by lecture. He
goes to both and turns in

his homework. At around 2
p.m., Rob returns to
Sutherland to eat and watch
TV. I found out that he is
addicted to soaps. His day
is seeminglyin jeopardy if
he doesn’t get to watch
“The Young and the
Restless” and “The Bold
and the Beautiful.”

After the soaps, he does
algebra homework and
studies for a geology quiz.
At 4 p.m. he has baseball
conditioning. Today is the
timed three-mile run. Every
player has to meet a certain
time.

Monday is a short base-
ball day for Rob. At 4:45
p.m.'he leaves to go eat
because he has a night
class. Administrative
Justice class flies by and by
8:10 p.m., Rob is at a
friend’s apartment in South
Oakland to watch “Melros_e
Place.”

TUESDAY: Rob gets up
at 10 a.m. to go to geology
at 11 a.m. He has a quiz
that he feels is quite diffi-
cult. “I studied the wrong
stuff,” he says to a class-
mate as he leaves the room.
At 1 p.m. he has history
class which is another long
lecture. This class causes

another step in rebuilding as
they received a verbal commit-
ment from Penn-Trafford’s star
quarterback Tony Zimmerman

to play in
1996.
After
a record-set-
ting sopho-
more year,
when he
completed 191 of 308 passes
for 2,618 yards and 34 touch-
downs, Zimmerman suffered a
season-ending injury his junior
season.

Although he didn’t play this
year, Zimmerman’s sophomore
second team all-state status
still had the college recruiters
interested. Instead of waiting
any longer, Zimmerman decid-
ed on Monday to commit to
Pitt, before his senior year.

“I wanted to get it out of the
way so I can concentrate on
my senior year,” Zimmerman
said. “I liked the school right
away. The coaches were really
friendly and it was a nice,
warm atmosphere.”

him to miss some of his
soaps, which he is not too
thrilled about. At 3 p.m., he
has to lift for baseball.
Today the team works on
their legs. They also do
huge amounts of sit-ups
and stomach crunches.

“The sit-ups are hell,” he
says. “No one likes them
but we have to do them.”

At 4:45 p.m. he returns to
Sutherland to eat. After
dinner, he does homework
until 10 p.m. when he
watches “NYPD Blue” with
his roommates. After that,
he passes out after a long
day.

WEDNESDAY: Tod’ay’s
class schedule is the same
as that of Monday. The dif-

ference is that baseball is

more intense.
From 2:30 p.m. to 3:30

I p.m. Rob lifts. The players

get a half-hour break in
between and at 4 p.m. they
work on agility. This con-
sists of shuffles, cone run-

his sickness is not from
drinking. It seems that he
has gotten the bug that
many people on campus
have had. By the afternoon,
he has missed all his class-
es and has thrown up three
times. But later in the day,
he begins to feel a little
better and goes to baseball
at 4 p.m.

Today is a particularly
rough day. The team must
run ten 300—yard sprints in
under 55 seconds. What
makes matters worse is that
one out of the 10 times a
player must be the “rabbit.”
The “rabbit” is a player
who must meet a personal
time or the whole team has
to run. Rob has about aver-
age speed. His time is about
43 seconds whereas the
fastest guy on the team is
around 40. Today goes pret-
ty well. ‘

After having an hour off
to eat, he lifts until 6:45
p.m. Rob then does a little
homework and starts" to
watch a football game. By

ditioning, Rob returns to
the dorm to eat and do
homework.

At 8 p.m. he goes to
watch TV with his friends
in South Oakland. At 9
p.m., we all went to a party

— down the street. I find out

at the party that Rob does
use baseball to his advan-
tage in one aspect. I leave
him alone for a few minutes
and come back to find him
in an animated conversation
with two attractive young
women. It seems that he has
told them that he is a
minor-league baseball star.
They fall for it and I play
along. This goes to show
you that anyone, whether
you are an athlete or not, is
capable of using bad pick-
up lines.

THURSDAY: This morn-
ing, Rob wakes up on the
couch of his friends’ apart-

ment. He walks home
around 10 a.m. and feels
very sick.

. After con-

half-time, he feels sick
again and calls it a day.

FRIDAY: Rob wakes up
early and feels much‘ better.
Friday isabout the same as
Monday. He has homework
due and a quiz. Baseball is
earlier today and he is lift-
ing by l p.m.

By late in the afternoon,
Rob is done with all
his work. Like most college
students, he is tired by

the end of the week and -

takes a short nap before
spending the evening with
friends.

This early in the base-
ball season, there is no
conditioning on weekends.
Rob will take it easy
Saturday and Sunday to get
himself ready for next
week, during which he has
two tests.

He plans to study Sunday
night. Rob is a bit of a pro-
crastinator, just like the
average college student at
the University of
Pittsburgh.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
NOW PRACTICIN G DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST SOME BUSINESSES IN

OAKLAND...

The University of Pittsburgh is state and federally
subsidized, and is now practicing discrimination. The
Original Hot Dog Shop has applied for choice dollars and has
been denied. The Original Hot Dog Shop is the oldest
restaurant in Oakland, having been there for 36 years.
Recently a new restaurant was opened, and they were given
choice dollars right away. The party that owns the restaurant
includes a member of city council. Does that tell you
anything? The Original Hot Dog Shop is a landmark in the
city of Pittsburgh. We have complied with all rules and
regulations and we have still been denied choice dollars. We
appeal our case to students, doctors, the board directors, and
the professors of the University of Pittsburgh. Question:
What do the University of Pittsburgh law students think of
this one?...

Wrestling

-From page 10
front of you.

All of the sports I’ve
mentioned have big follow-
ings in other parts of the
country, but are hardly visi-
ble here at Pitt.

I don’t buy the notion
that because this is a major
city with three professional
sports teams, only the
major athletic programs
can thrive.

The school on the whole
could do a better job of
promoting some of these
sports. Aside from an ad on
an occasional PAT bus, you
never hear enough about
the Pitt ladies’ basketball
team. There are more teams
here than just the football
and the men’s basketball
team.

Even The Pitt News could
do a better job of getting
the word out about upcom-
ing events. In the past there
have been sports schedules
on the first sports page. At
least with that little bit,
someone would know when
a given team’s event would
take place.

And writers here at the
paper must make a better
effort to cover these teams

to the fullest.

Recently, the Pitt
wrestling team defeated
Penn State for the first time
in 14 years, but nothing
was in the paper because
the writer missed the event.
I guarantee no one here in
the sports department
would miss a football or
basketball game unless
some form of divine inter-
vention prevented him from
attending.

The point to all this is
that the university could do
more for some of the
teams. Maybe some more
posters around school dis-
playing their upcoming

, events, or just a little more

marketing. The Pitt News
needs to balance its cover-
age of sports teams and
-devote more columns to
some of these lesser-known
sports.

Some of these teams are
of championship caliber,
and deserve better from the
school and this paper than
they’ve received in the
past.

for The Pitt News.

Column

°From page 9

Jordan is long gone. My guess
is you'll see him sometime in
the future — in the CBA.

It was also suggested that
the Bulls’ future is with “tal-
ented young players” like
Simpkins. I do believe that
Pippen, Armstrong and
Kukoc, the core of the team,
fit the description of young
talent. What the Opinions
department fails to realize is
that it is nearly impossible to
win an NBA title with young
players. Look at the Charlotte
Hornets. They have one of the
most talented rosters in the
league. In the last two years,
they have only made the play-
offs once and were eliminated
that year in the second round.
In order to win a title, a team
needs a good mix of young
players and veterans. With
Jordan on the roster, the Bulls
have just that.

It was pathetic when it was
suggested that Jordan’s return
is injurious to the team. It
doesn’t take a rocket scientist

to ﬁgure out that the Bulls will
be a much better team with
him on the ﬂoor. Chicago’s
highly structured triangle
offense, which is designed to
create jump shots and
rebounding opportunities all
over the ﬂoor, has not been the
same since Jordan left. With
his return, everyone will bene-
ﬁt. Pippen will no longer be
expected to carry the team,
Kukoc will not have to take
every big shot and Armstrong

. will once again get more open

looks at the hoop.
And finally, Jordan’s return

- is good for the NBA. The

league’s image has sagged
recently as young stars are
now known more for whining
and shoe contracts as opposed
to what they actually accom-
plish on the court. Jordan is a
class act, both on and off the
court, which is more than I can
say for the views of the
Opinions department:

Brett F ondrk is a senior staﬁ
writer for The Pitt News.

Tennesee. There are four
divisions. West Virginia,
Bethany, Weeling, and Ohio
University join Pitt in its
division.

Women's lacrosse was
started on campus just six
years ago and for that reason
it has very little funding.

“We put a proposal for
money into the school and
we got only about $600 this
year, which is almost nothing
when considering our
expenses,” Kapili said. “We
had to pay for our own uni-
forms through fund raisers.
Funds are lacking, and if we
don’t raise the money then
there won’t be a team, it’s as
simple as that. We are trying
to start‘a booster club with
parents which should help.
Parents and the men’s
lacrosse team have been sup-
portive.”

The school pays ‘for van
transportation to games and
goalie equipment only. The
team does not have a coach

and is currently looking for
one. ' .

“If we had a coach we
would be a better team,”
Marcus said. “The first cou-
ple of practices were really
unorganized and that is
where a coach could help.
The captains are doing a
good job leading the team,
but a coach would only
improve our team.”

Despite these disadvan-
tages they are undefeated.
Leading scorers Bowman, 15
goals, and Marcus, 11 goals,
will lead their team to a tour-
nament at Michigan State
this weekend with six other
schools, including Notre
Dame and Ohio State.

The squad of 19 girls,
made primarily of under-
classmen, looks ahead to the
league playoffs at Ohio
State, where they will con-
tend for the league title. The‘
last women's lacrosse home
game is Sunday April 3 at
7:00 p.m. at the Cost Center.

°From page 9
In Zimmerman’s sophomore

_ campaign he led Penn-Trafford

to a 9-1 record. But that sum-
mer the 6-foot-3-inch, 215-
pounder tore his anterior cruci-
ate ligament in a basketball
game, causing him to miss his
junior season. With
Zimmerman’s absence, Penn-
Trafford went 2-8.

“I’d like to get back on top
this year,” he said.

Having already made infor-
mal visits to Penn State and
Michigan, Zimmerman decided
on Pitt because “they came right
out and offered me a scholar-
ship.”

Zimmerman also said that he

likes the direction the football

program is going.

“They made a commitment to
rebuilding and I would like to
be part of it,” he said.

Besides being cited as one of
the best players in-the East,
Zimmerman has already passed
his Scholastic Aptitude Test, so
he will be eligible to play right
away.
