By JIM MARGITAN‘
* e Staff News Writer V I
_, “‘I think it’s a thrill . . . an honor.” This is how
Laura Kurland, the 1968 Homecoming Queen, de-
scribed the first few weeks of her reign in an ex-
clusive interview with The Pitt News.

’ Miss Kurland didn’t‘ know that the girls in her
dorm had nominated her for the position ‘until a
“member of. the Homecoming Committee approach-
ed her to ask abouther extra-curricular activi-
ties.

A Her twin sister told Miss Kurland of her elec-
.. tion as a finalist. Following this was lunch with
A; ' the judges _on Friday, Oct. 25 and later 20 minute

; interviews. The winner was notified of her selec---
‘ tion at the concert Friday evening. The crowning
‘ at the football game on Saturday was, according
to Miss Kurland, a sort of anti-climax when com-
pared to Friday night.

A senior history major, Miss Kurland is in the
internship teaching program and will attend col-
lege after she graduates this year to receive her
Master's and teaching degrees. Her chief area of
concentration has been American history with
Russian and European histories as. minors. She
loves the University but said that she was unde-
cided whether to stay here or go to ‘Boston or New
 York for further education. ‘

_A native of New York’s Manhattan district,
she is familiar with large city life and enjoys all
the activities available in Pittsburgh, both on and
1. off campus. After she receives her teaching degree,-
-“she thinks she might return to New York to teach.
’_.Miss Kurland likes art also, although, by her
own admission, she isn’t much of a painter herself.
Her other interests include singing, dancing, ten-
nis, "swimming, and baseball. She said she left out
football ‘because, in her own .words, “I’m too
small.” ' ‘

A  7 Her position as a Resident Assistant in North

 Holland «Hall provides her with much knowledge on
‘fthe present issues of social rules and curfews. She
 likes the new social rules that are in committee be-
,‘ cause the students “need privacy.” However, she
_?disagrees with the idea of open houses every night
‘ since this would make studying almost impossible.
' Although ‘ agreeing that first term freshmen
need the curfew, she thinks that it should be abol-
_ ished for the rest of the girls. If the girls’ moth-

Club Betters

Student-Prof
Relationships

A proposal has been made by
the Psychology Department for
an active psychology club that
would emphasize student-facu1-
ty participation. The club could-
well provide the initiative for pro-
moting improved relations be-
tween University’ students and
their professors in all major
fields.

Members of the proposed club
could get to know their profes-
sors outside class. Coffee hours
would provide an informal. at-
mosphere for the discussion of
-pertinent topics. Other activities
of the club would include guest

as Western Psych, and student-
faculty social affairs.

A club of this nature would give
the psychology students a chance
to learn about interesting job
opportunities with a B.S. in Psy-
chology; discussion chology;
discussion of graduate-

 

psychology, but related fields

She is quite pleased with life at the University

Michigan Relaxes Rules

While the University’s dorm"

At Michigan, all girls over 21
and all girls under 21 who have
parental permission are free of
curfews, in contrast to the Uni-
versity here where all girls have
curfews except for those in the
Honors Area of Tower C. Men
at both universities have no cur-
fews.

Michigan’s policies were estab-

‘lished within the following guide-

lines: “The proper balance of
academic, social, and political
aspects of University life; the
maintenance of good taste; the
meticulous safeguarding of the
rights of minorities; the utiliza-
tion of the experience and advice
of University Housing staff.”

The decision was reached after
a survey of opinion on" the Michi-
gan campus. The vice-president
of student affairs recommended
to the Regents to continue the
policy permanently because there
have been no abuses.

Premarital sex and cohabita-
tion at Michigan will not be tol-
erated.

The Michigan policy recogniz-
ed “the capacity of University
students to manage their person-
al lives in a mature and construc-
tive fashion” and fostered “a
climate within which personal
freedom and responsibility con-
tribute to educational and social
development.”

Richard Cutler, the vice-pres-
ident of student affairs, issued
a statement which said that this
idea “attracted attention from
college administrators across the
nation. With few exceptions, it has
been the subject of unqualified
praise, and the University is en-
vied for having faced the issue
with careful thought and for hav-
ing reached a forward-looking de-
cision.”

Months ago new social rules ‘

were formulated here, but since
then have been tied up in com-
mittee while the University of
Michigan has been enjoying the
benefits of liberalized rules for
almost a year, with no ill effects.

Looking Ahead

The election is over, and Richard Milhous Nixon’s strat-
egy has worked. Now he must govern.

A Mr. Nixon will be in for a rough four years. for he is
ascending to the Presidency in times that necessitate pro-
‘found change in America. But Mr. Nixon will not only be
troubled by problems in the city; he will have to resolve

-many vastly important foreign policy questions. The war in

Vietnam is still in progress with no end in sight, people are
dying of starvation in India; Red China is increasing her
nuclear capacity; germ warfare research is producing so-
phisticated and frightening results; the Middle East threat-

ens to explode; and Latin America is threatened by future so-

cial revolutions.

Equally disturbing is the fact that the United States is
now a divided house, facing external as well as internal di-
lemmas so profound that they threaten the future of demo-
cracy, the United States, and mankind.

These aren’t pretty thoughts, but these problems do, in
fact, exist. And no solutions seem to be in sight. Maybe Mr.
Nixon will be able to solve these problems; maybe he will
fail; maybe he will leave things as they are. No person can
predict the unpredicatable future. -

Even so, there are some forthcoming problems that
Americans—and Mr. Nixon—should be thinking about at this
time. What action will the United States take if the Middle
East flares up again. Will we take sides with Israel? Will
we remain neutral? Will we confront the Soviet’s in the Mid-

 dle East in the name of democracy?

If the problem of Vietnam is not resolved at the confer-
ence table, what will we do? Will we pull out our troops

immorality? Will we bomb Haiphong harbor. Will we in-
vade North Vietnam? Will we start World War III?
Vietnam and the Middle East are two geographic areas

‘of the world that receivethe focus of world opinion. There
[are other areas—neglected areas—that will, -in- the future, be

stages of world drama.

' Ever since the advent of Vietnam, a Latin America,
ripe for revolution, has been neglected by the publicity
agents. In the next four years, the foreign policy of the

United States and the judgment of Richard Nixon will be

tested by the forthcoming crises" in Latin America. The po-

litical scamble in Chile—of all places—may very well foment

war. The Chilean people, next year, will go to the polls to

-elect their next President. In 1965, an unusual coalition of

the center and right combined to stop the election of a Cas-

ltroite Socialist. There is serious doubt, however, that this

unusual feat can be repeated in 1969. It is quite possible
that a Castroite may be elected legally to the Chilean Pres-
idency. What would our government’s position be in this
circumstance. Would President Nixon accept the election
of a Communist in this the “American Hemisphere.”
Would he send troops to Chile to set matters “straight.”
How could he justify this situation to the American people?
This situation would be a test for any man. But it will be

_ the first of many tests.

There will be “tests” at our universities; there will be
“tests” in the cities this summer; there will be “tests” be-
tween the old and the young. And there will be confronta-
tion between the old and new politics, between rich and

poor, between black and white, between left and right, and

between police and citizen. Yes, the era of confrontation is
beginning to unfold. «

The era of confrontation will bloom simultaneously
with the era of assination, for we live in sick times. Our na-

' , tion is neurotic. People today are so caught up in their own

problems that they don’t give a damn. They worry about
their own hang-ups, and forget about other people. In this
situation, all-of us are going crazy, and hope is dying out.

So many students have been put down in this election
year. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were assi-
nated, and Eugene McCarthy never had a chance against the
machine. But there is a new era forming around the his-
torical corner. It is the era of youth. Soon most of the elec-
torate will be under 35; soon the nation will be governed by
young men with young, progressive ideas.

If we as a nation survived years of the old politics, we
can survive four more years of the same. After that, a new
day will be born.

Idealism  . The One Fatal
Quality To T0day’s World

by DON MARBURY
Staff Feature Editor

I am dying . . . Everyday that I wake up death
eats at me more and more.

You see, I am an idealist, and idealists have one

fatal quality; they have hope for the future; hope.

that things will get better with V
time. I am going to die because ‘
I can’t hate. The expression, “an
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth,” has no meaning to me.

I DO THINGS like looking at
another man’s heart, instead of
his skin. I don’t ask people what
their last name is or what is their K
religion, before-I ask them things _ '
like, “Is there anything I can do MAR1_3URY
for you” . . . . or “Can I help you in any way?”

When I am gone, I will be called a fool, an
idealistic idiot. “Imagine him,” they will say,
“thinking there might one day be one big race,
with everyone equal to everyone else.” They will
ridicule me ‘by saying things like: “You know, that
old fool even had the nerve to say that a person
with white skin and a person with black are equal

    

to each other?” They won’t realize that both of
their skins are the same. If cut, won’t they both
bleed, and won’t both of the persons feel pain if
you burn their skin.

IF I COULD only hate, maybe I wouldn’t have
to die. If I could hate, the sight of so much hate
and animosity that people have towards one an-
other, wouldn’t cause me such pain. If I could only
get rid of this optimism that is inside of me, I
might have a chance for life. But I can’t. Instead
of taking hate for granted, and accepting it as a
perpetual thing, I keep hoping and wishing that it
will not exist. Instead of feeling hate and violence
for the person who calls me a nigger, all I feel is
pity.

Who will they call my murderer? Most likely
it will be blamed on myself. “He should have ad-
justed to the way things are,” they will say. But»I
can’t adjust. How can a person accept something
that is completely against every thought and feel-
ing he has ever had?

So_I will continue to die . . . little by little, ev—.

ery day. I will be dead when my hope is not longer
able to keep out the hate, and I to, become just an-
other common, average, hate—filled individual.

because of the lack of South Vietnamese cooperation? Will ‘
.-we keep our troops in their same precarious position? We
"will let more young men die in the name of illegality and

 

The Different Drummer

Some Words Are Vile, Some Sick
But Here Are The ‘Gross Words’

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

The Pitt News has lately been
criticized for printing “obscene”
and “dirty” language on it pages.
Revised newspaper policy dic-
tates that abbreviations (such as
“fl/43/81/25/8” and “S-3/45/3&3/8") a n d
euphemisms (such as “inter—
course” and “waste”) will sub-
stitute for spe— r

cific obscen-
ities.
N 0 n e t h e-

less, if I write
‘ ‘ w a s t e 0 r
“s—1/25/s ?_,».” it is
still going to
mean the same
thing to the
reader. After  .
all, if I want LEV
to transmit a certain thought to
the reader it doesn’t really mat-
ter if I spell it out or abbreviate
it, I’m nonetheless communicat-
ing.

It seems a curious thing to me
that if I say intercourse, I offend
no one, but if I say “f—1/25/33/4,” lof-
fend many people. Of course,
both words mean the same
“d—5/s3/4” thing. This newspaper, at
any rate, has managed to offend
many—many who insist on our us-
ing the above rules of censorship.

IN THIS COLUMN, however,

 

 

I win" attemp to offend everyone
by employing the‘ “filthiest”
words in my vocabulary for no
instructive, informative, or es-
thetic purpose_— save offending
as many people as possible.

The first word I am going to,

use is “war.” I refuse to call it
“battle” or “fighting” and Iwill
not abbreviate it “w—5/s.” I will
stand solidly behind what I write,
wheter it entails insult, degrada-
tion, civil suit, or otherwise. The
word is war. Bloody, senseless,
useless, war. I’ll write it on every
bathroom wall just to see how
gross I can be.

Another obscenity that supple-
ments war is “kill” or “killing”
or “murder.” There isn’t even a
euphemism for this one. People
are killing each other in wars.
People who are like you or me;
people who just want a little hap-
piness and peace out of life;
These people are killing each
other in wars. They are stabbing
each other with knives and shoot-
ing each other with “guns” (an-
other filthy word ). "

“BOMB”; IS A rank word. Al-
most an unthinkable word. It is
almost unthinkable to think that
a handful of men in this world
have the power to push a few lit-

tle buttons that can release a few-

little bombs’ that will instantan-

‘ Reflections Of The Spleen P'W""""""

word “bomb,” a gross obscenity_

hanging over our heads like the
sword of Damocles. How many
people were there like us; law-
abiding, peaceful, raising fami-
lies, going to school; in Hiroshi-
ma and Nagasaki who were
bombed to a bloody death, who
were murdered by people they
didn’t know for reasons that they
never understand?

But the filthiest of all words
in. ‘any language is the word
“hate.” Couple that with the ob-
senity “prejudice” and it’s
enough to stink out the city of
Pittsburgh. People in Pittsburgh,
like people in cities and towns
everywhere, hate and prejudge
each other day in and day out ad
infinitum.

PEOPLE HATE each other for
their differences and then hate
again for their similarities. The
inclusion of a person in a class,
be it racial,’ religious, political,
or otherwise, automatically qualf-
flies him to prejudices and hatreds
from people of classes of which
they are not members. This is ob-
scenity in its dirtiest form.

understand

by MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist

It seems that today everyone
has something to say and feels
that it is important that they be
heard. This situation, although it
may seem to be a healthy one,
can become quite disastrous when
we realize that if everyone had
something to say and said it, there
wouldn’t be anyone to listen to
them.

THIS COULD lead to a gen-
eral misunderstanding—I take that
back, there wouldn’t be any mis-
understanding if nobody listen-
ed and misunderstood in the first
place. For example, you could
say, “I didn’t understant that‘lec-
ture.” Since nobody would be lis-
tening to you, they couldn’t un-
derstand your not understanding;
but then again, they couldn’t un-
derstand your not understanding
either.

Perhaps all this sounds rather
silly (at least I hope it does), but
I feel it serves to show that we
are no longer interested in being
good listeners. As a matter of
fact, when was the last time you
and your friends got together and
listened? Sure, everybody can
talk, but I_’ll bet you couldn’t find
two people anywhere nowadays
having a good listening. This is
sad, because‘ it’s really so easy to
be a listener.

For example, let’s say you want
to impress your professor, by ask-
ing a monumental question on
some ponderous topic. Now you
know he’s going to give you a
long answer, and the best way to
make him think you understand
him is to listen well.

HE MIGHT start out by say-
ing, “Well, the metamorphosis of
the gargantuan tendency some-
how being, equated to diabo_lic

reciprocity of the tangent, we can 

only endeavor to ascertain cer-
tain sundry facets concerning its
mating habits. . .”

He looks at you and you nod,
then squeeze your eyes close and
purse your lips as if locked in
deep concentration. He’ll be re-
assured by your look of deep re-
flection and continue . . . “some-
how transcendant to the hypo-
tenuse of the plu-perfect squared,
not forgetting for a moment the
inevitable inturstices of this con-
glomeration which collectively
we call ‘silly putty’ . . .”

Again he’ll stop and look at
you to see if you’re listening, so
this time you shake your head
from side to side, sigh, and wet
your lips. Given these encourag-
ing signs, the professor will go
on and finish his answer. '

Maybe you’ve read this article
and said to yourself, “Well, I’ve
listened long enough.” Easy, was-
n’tit? .

Remember After We Forget

 

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

Now that the election is over,
everyone has his opinion as to
what happened and what could
have happened. But if it were pos-
sible, wouldn’t it be interesting
to hear what certain neutral bodies
thought of the campaigns, the
election, and the result.

Considgr the ‘

merits the Civ-
ic Arena heard
from all three
political par- .‘ =
ties and their /;
respective fol-

lowers. What
do you think 
the Arena, and l l

thousands of

of similar buildings ‘across the na-
tion, have to say now as they re-
sume their duties as auditoriums,
field houses, and ballrooms?

THE BUILDING from which I
would like to hear the most is
not a large arena; it is not a ball-
room; in fact, it will have a dif-
ficult time regaining its identity
now that the final vote is cast. I
am referring to the little build-

ing on the corner of Fifth Avenue
and Atwood Street, two blocks
from campus.

Just think how excited that little
building was last spring when a
group of interested students util-
ized it for their “Students for Mc-
Carthy” headquarters. And im-
agine the importance the build-
ing had when more students joined
the “Students for McCarthy and
Kennedy” and filled the build-
ing daily to plot strategy forthe
Pennsylvaina primary.

September came, and the build-
ing joined forces with the “Citi-
zens for Humphrey,” hoping to
salvage what they could from the
election year.

THE LITTLE BUILDING was
in its glory on Monday and Tues-
day, as interested passer-by stop-
ped in to pick up last minute signs,
buttons, and literature.

But when I saw the building on
Wednesday, I felt sorry for it.
A few shared the suspenceful vi-
gil with the building Tuesday
night, but in the short space of
a few hours the little building had
become a deserted battlefield, and
had only the fond memories of

‘ the past eight months to console

its lonely heartbreak.
We, as students, may express

our feelings and look to the fu-
ture, for we have other causes for
which to unite now. That little
building saw it all, heard it all,
felt "it all —- but now it is alone
once again. -

HOW MANY of us would have
heard from buildings similar to
the little ‘one on Fifth Avenue last
year at this time if they could have
told us of their past experiences
with elections, campaigns, and
strategies, offered to plan strat-
egy.

And how many of us will hear
the cries of the little building in
future years when we have grown
old and lost our student idealism?
Will we remember, as the little
building does now, how-much work,
energy, and time went into the Mc-

cause?

Possibly the little building feels

that its ultimate fate is to be burn- 1

ed by discontented students, or
to be replaced by a classroom in
the expansion program so nec-
essary for mass-programming of
students.

The little building suffered a
defeat with "its concerned stu-

I read each article in hopes of

literary opportunities, from ser-

Humor in this isse also hit its

lack of originality, over-exploi-

Band Deserves
Editor, The Pitt News:

It’s discouraging when a truly
high class organization right here
on campus such as the March-
ing Band is overlooked when dish-
ing out credit where credit is
due. .

The Pitt Marching Band is an

. organization that has brought

recognition and a sense of pride
to the University. The 120 men
practice an average of 7 hours a
week to perform a 9 minute half
‘time show of fine precision mar-
ching and excellent musician-

viding an enjoyable show, and

Fraternities Oust Students

Editor, The Pitt News;

A few years ago, there was talk
of urine trickling down the Cathe-
dral and falling on the students;
well, now, the wind has changed
and blows straight out of frater-
nity row!

Dick Gregory was right; there
are new Niggers in the country,
and here, the new Nigger is the
independent. The Homecoming
Theme — “This is my Country”
“really makes one stop and think.

Racism permeates our campus,
and the black is not the only one
who suffers. After being “fro—
zen out” at- the football game on
Saturday, I took my girlfrield

‘Recognition’

time will probably agree with me.

This past weekend the Band
traveled 1200 miles to Miami to
represent the University and re-
ceived a standing ovation from the
crowd of 55,000 (the first stand-
ing ovation in the history of the
Orange Bowl).

The crowd was so enthusias-
tic over the Band that it joined
in by singing “God Bless Am-
erica.” Many people in Miami
said the Pitt Marching Band was
the best that has ever played at
the Orange Bowl. In view of this,
I congratulate the Band and say
thank you.

to the Homecoming Dance that

night.

But the fraternities, apparent-
ly resenting our encroachment on
their private party, forced us off ‘
a crowed dance floor by mono-

oplizing it during their “circle”

dance, and out of the dance by
pulling barious stunts, like hiding
my girl’s purse. If Homecoming

is a fraternity function, why is it
advertised as a school function?
If the student section at the foot-
ball game isn’t for all the stu-
dents, why not call it the fra-
ternity section?

I know that nothing concrete can
be done about the piggish and
boorish behavior of the frater-
nities at most school functions;
but, something can certainly be
done about the seating at the foot-
ball game.

If the fraternities don’t change
their seating policies, we, as in-
dependents, could either save the
whole student section and let the
fraternities sit in the end zone,
as we are so often forced to
do, or consider any seat with no
one in it an available seat and up
for grabs!

It’s about time that someone
told the greeks that on this cam-
pus, no one’s rear end is golden!

Cultural Clash, Film Festival,

‘Fiddler’ 011 N

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Entertainment Editor

Rumor has it that the Living Theater guided by
the magic fingers of Julian Beck and Judith Malina
is soon to smash head on with the -stodgy languid
forces of the Pittsburgh cultural front. The out-
come is surely to be that of bitter confusion and
wild invectives. That is only to be expected. It is a
type of reaction-formation which is a direct out-

growth of the confrontation between two opposing -. 

and mutually exclusive existences. The Living The-

ater represents anarchy and cultural guerrilla war, Ti

fare. It is a reaction to social complacency, to hate
and violence and to brooding, self-defeating ego-
ism. Its aim is to take the theater off the stage and
into the streets; to remove the illusion of the actor-
audience polarity and to establish a one-in-all in-
volvement. '

It is not too clear when and where the Living
Theater will perform. A big question right now is
whether or not they will be performing at all. A
light whisper came to my ear proclaiming the holy

. grounds -to be the Soldiersand Sailors Hall and the

date somewhere around the 16-19 of November. But
all that is obscure and unsubstantiated. As soon as
I find out more, I’ll let you know.

I hope everyone by now is aware of the Reper-
tory Film Festival which is being initiated by the
Playhouse. It promises to be the most ambitious
and comprehensive film showing in the Pittsburgh
area. The selections for November are a compen-
dium of the classic films. Some of the directors rep-
resented are Bergman, Antonioni, Sternberg, Truf-
faut and Kurosawa. The films are all 35mm and

‘ are shown for two days, twice each nigth. Tuesdays

are set aside for special series and this month is de-

voted to comedy. For more information, see ac-
..companying schedule. Thiscoming Monday’s pa-

per will have a preview by film critic Paul Anderson
of the films in the November series.

It really seems strange to -jump from such things
as the Living Theater and contemporary film clas-
sics to Broadway musical but nevertheless Fiddler
on the Roof will begin a four week engagement at
the Nixon Theater starting Monday night, Nov, 11.
I have not yet seen this performance so it is im-
possible for me to recommend it at this particular
tir_r1,e. Tickets are now on sale at the Nixon b0x-of-
fice and National Record Mart stores. This is a pro-
duction by a national road. company which is re-
turning form a six month engagement at the Cae-

 .r Marketing at IBM

 ‘fworking with

‘‘I’m pretty much the IBM Corporation in.

the eyes of my customers,” says Andy Moran.
“That kind of responsibility's not bad for an I
engineerjust two years out of school.” '

Andy earned his B.S.E.E. in 1966. Today,_ -
he’s aMarketing Representative with IBM,
involved in the planning, selling and installa-
tion of data processing systems.

Plenty of business experience

“Engineering was my first love," Andy says,
“but I still wanted good business experience."
So far, he’s worked with customers involved
in many different computer applications,

from engineering to business. His contacts

go from data processing managers all the
way up to the president of his largest account.

“At first I was a little nervous about working
at that level,” says Andy. “But then you realize
you're trained to know what he’s trying to

 ;   company presidents
  is part of the jobi’

learn. That gives you confidence. You're
helping him solve his problem.”

With his workingpartner, the data proc-
essing Systems Engineer, Andy has helped
many customers solve their information‘
handling problems. ‘‘I geta broad overview
of business because I run into every kind of
probl-em going. Sometimes I know the solu-
tions from experience. Other times I need
help from my manager. '

“That's one of the best things. My manager? .-

is more of a backup than a boss. He’s there‘
when I need him. Usually, I pretty much call
my own shots."

Andy’s experience isn’t unusual at IBM.
There are many Marketing and Sales Repre-
sentatives who could tell you of similar
experiences. And they have many kinds of
academic backgrounds: business, engineer-
ing: liberal arts, science. '

\

They not only sell data processing equipment
as.Andy does, but also IBM office products
and information records systems. Many of
the more technically inclined are data
processing Systems Engineers.

The Draft

. COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE
;. Although the nation's graduate
schools did not face the 70 percent re-
gductin in fall enrollment some predicted
last -year because of the draft, the sec-
ond semester crunch may hurt them badly.
* Most universities were taken by sur-
-"prise this fall when the 25-50 percent of
their students expecting to be drafted
es-returned to school. Some universities,
accepting more graduate students than
they couldhandle in order to make up for
the draft’s toll, have been faced with mon-
‘ey andhousingshortages — and too many
students. -

ice System announced that graduate stu-
’ dents would no longer be deferred “in the
national interest,” both the universities
and the government predicted that schools
-might lose up to 70 percent of their first-
Iyear, students. They forecasted a great in-
crease in female‘ and middle-aged gradu-
L,-ate students. —

In February when the Selective Serv- '

  Prrr NCCEAWS-—FriVday, November 3, .1968

Selective Service officials predicted
that students would make up as much
as 90 percent of the draft call-ups in many
states. The Defense Department said 63
percent of the 240,000 draftees predict-
ed for 1969 would be students. Students
comprised 3.8 percentof the total this
year.

But the crunch failed to materialize

~ this fall. Draft calls beginning in July

were drastically lower than those for pre-
vious months. This trend should continue
until January when the elections are well
over. I

How much calls will rise depends on
the manpower needs of the armed forces,‘
the status_of the Vietnam war and the
mood of the new president.

Whatever the increase, it -is sure to’
hit. the universities harder next semes-
ter; under present ‘draft regulations,’ the
oldest eligible males are first to go, and

graduate students newly classified 1-A’

are perfect targets. Those who receive

induction notices during the present school
term are allowed to stay in school to finish
the term, but must then report for induc-
tion. ‘

But despite the fact that total gradu-
ate enrollment has changed very little
numerically, the edict has not been without
effect. Graduate schools at several uni-
versities have reported drops in enroll-
ment from one to 20 percent. Profession-
al schools seem harder hit than most. At
many schools, graduate departments
have found that women and older men
(over 26) made up a larger portion of their
enrollees than‘ever before. Some schools
claim that their students are~of' lower
ability than they would have been ‘before
the draft’. ,g

Decline of graduate schoolequality is

impossible to_document but a decline in_ '
-morale among graduatestudents is more_

obvious. And graduate students this year,
knowing they are sitting atop the prover-
bial powder keg and may get the letter

' :3’

V Second   Semester To Hurt GradSchools

any day, are unusually nervous and fear- ,

ful.

Universities which opposed the move
to end graduate deferments are react-
ing to their students’ concern in many
ways. Several universities have announc-
ed that students whose education is inter-
rupted by the draft — either for two years
of service or for a jail sentence for resist-
ance_ — will later be able to resume their
degree work where they left off, and will

stand a good chance of having their fellow-.

ships renewed.

The institutions are understandably
vexed. Many of them —— like their students
— concurred with the 1967 recommenda-
tions of the President’s Commission on
the Draft. The Commission’s report sug-
gested a two-pronged attack on the draf.t’s
present inequities and injustices: abolition
of student deferments and reversal of the
present “oldest firstl’ system so that 19
ye_ar-olds would be ‘drafted first — pref-
erably by lottery. ‘

Project Upward Bound prefers

 ungle Cats vs. Irish Coliseum Revisited? ”'

‘by ART ROSENGARTEN

In biblical days, it was the Christians who
were thrown to the lions. Tomorrow after-
noon, the reverse may happen. The Irish of
Notre dame will attempt to devour the punch-
less Panthers.

In a season in which the gridders aimed for five
or six victories, the drive has now been directed to-
 wards striving for respectability and pride. As
' head coach Dave Hart commented earlier in the
 week, “I just hope that our young men have enough
'3 pride to get themselves ready to play one of the best
games of their lives.” '

After a shellacking last week at the hands of
Miami, Hart expects that Terry Hanratty and Co.
will try to run up the score. “Everybody tries to
 run it up on us, because of the edge it gives when
_; recruiting in Western Pennsylvania. Also, when a
5 team is fighting for a place in the top ten, a big
3 score always looks impressive.” 1

 “Believe me, we try not to let them do it,” he

continued. “We certainly suffer when they run up
the score.”

   
 
  
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
 

action against Notre Dame.

To replace Stevens at defensive tackle, the coaches have shifted defensive end Paul
Naponick into the tackle slot. “Paul is best going straight in, and he should help us at
this spot,” commented Hart.

The all-important prowler position usually held by Pribbish, is up for grabs. Hart
may work Barr back into the line-up at that spot or he may start sophomore Bill Ramos
there. '

In an effort to get the offensive team back on the beam, Hart plans to utilize differ-
ent blocking patterns for the linemen and have quarterback Dave Havern do part of his
passing out of the shot-gun formation.

. Last week Havern had his worst game of the season. “He just wasn’t sharp at all,”
said Hart. He had open receivers and either overthrew or underthrew them.

“We plan to do a great deal of passing and I certainly hope that Havern is on the
beam. Last week, he had the the time and the receivers, but just couldn't -et the ball
there,” Hart stated.

The Panther’s receiving corps has been one of the bright spots, and if Havern can
get the ball near one of themnthe chances are quite good that they will catch it. Lead-
ing the receivers is All-East candidate Harry “Skip” Orszulak. Orszulak has already
corralled 31 passes for 530 yards and 4. TD. He ‘ -
is only 15 receptions shy of Bob Longo’s school re-
cord of 46 set in 1966. '

Tight end George Medich has caught 28 passes

 

 

he: .
.,f'E ‘

so far this season for 314 yards and two touchdowns.
Wingback Joe McCain, who has been hampered by
injuries at times this season, has managed 20 catches
for 278 yards. "

With an Irish defensive front four averaging 6’3”
and 246 pounds, the Panther offensive linemen will
have their hands full. Even though they are giving
away as much as 40 pounds per man, Hart feels

that with the shot-gun formation and different types
of blocking, the linemen should be able to provide
Havem with the necessary time to pass.

 

As an added aid to. the Irish, the injury list
of the gridders continues to grow. Lost for the season
is starting offensive tackle George Richards. Rich-
ards has a bone chip in his knee and will be operated
on Monday. /

Also not making the trip to South Bend will be defensive tackle John Stevens,
middle guard Lloyd Weston, and Rod Fedorchak. Stevens suffered a leg injury during the
first half against Miami, while Weston is still recovering from strained ligaments in

' , his knee. .

Fedorchak is a different story. He was suspended indefinitely by coach Hart, for
breaking curfew the night before the Miami game.

On the other side of the ledger, Jeff Barr, Denny Ferris, and possibly George Prib-
bish will return to action. Barr is stillfeeling the effects of a broken thumb and Prib-
bish is still hobbled by an ankle injury. Ferris still has the charley horse which has
sidelined him for the past two games. Hart expects all three of these boys to see some“

BILL RAMOS
(.‘0ul(l Start at Prowler

Hart feels that his offense must be able to control
the ball much more than they did against Miami, if
the Panthers are to have any chance to win of keep-
ing the game close. “The most important thing is to
stay in the game,” he said flatly.

 Irish Top Pass Combo 1

y MARTHA HARTLE
Terry Hanratty and Jim Seymour give Notre Dame one of

 the top passing combinations in the nation. Tomorrow after-

noon at South Bend Indiana, the Panther pass defense will have
its work cut out for it in trying to stop the Irish glamour boys.
“It’s really going to be tough,” explained Jeff Barr, who returns to

the lineup as a prowler this week after missing three games with a hand
injury. “We’ll just try to catch Seymour off the line and rough him up

a little.”

“Hanratty and Seymour form
the best combination in college
ball right now,” commented de-
back Bryant Salter.

“I feel he can keep up with
Seymour. He’s only a sophomore

agreed“ Salter, _“but we’re going

Notre Dame (5-2), fresh from last week’s, 45-14 trouncing of Navy,
moves the ball at will both in the air and on the ground.

The pass-catch combination of ‘Terry Hanratty and split-end Jim
Seymour is probably the best in the nation. Hanratty has completed

58 per cent of his passes, good
through the first six games.

Hanratty’s accuracy is aided
by the sure hands of All-American
Seymour, who after six games has
grabbed 35 passes and scored three
times. But tight end Jim Wine-

Stu Parry brings his soccer team
here, tomorrow, and the Zips don’t’
intend on making the visit a pleas-
ant one. At least, not for Leo Bem-
is. The game is at Forbes Field at
2 p.m.

The Zips boast the best record of
any squad the kickers will face.
They.have yet to lose after nine
games, and are headed for their
second consecutive Ohio Collegi-
ate Soccer Association title.

“They’re the only undefeated,
untied team in th e Midwest,”
Bemis complained. “In fact they
beat Michigan State."

The Zips’ biggest win, however,
came last Saturday when they
edged Cleveland State, 1-0. CSU
had been tied with Parry’s kickers
in the OCSA.

The score in that battle was,not
very indicative of th e type of
game the Zips have been playing.
They have a powerful offensive at-
tack. In their nine games to date,
they have totaled 37 goals, many
more than the booters. ‘

A pair of Dundee, Scotland, ath-
letes have been carrying the load
so far. Jim Malcom, a senior line-
man, is leading the Association in
-total points. He has hit the nets 16
times and assisted on two other
scores, giving him 18 po'ints..The
Scotsman played his finest game
against Ohio Wesleyan when he
bagged four goals, and he hit for
three against Bowling Green.

His fellow countryman is John
Kissner. This lineman has contri-

RON BUGAJ ,(left)in action against Ohio U. The Bobcats are the only
booter opponent that has faced Akron, tomorrow’s opposition. The Zips
defeated Ohio, 5-3, while the kickers bowed to the Bobcats, 3-0.

 

buted seven goals and five assists
to the Zips’ winning season.

But, the Akron soccermen are
not all offense. As the CSU victory
would indicate they can get tough
on defense. The important defend-
eris are John Lwaerg and Paul Far-
re .

“I don’t look for them to play,
defense against us,” B.emis reason-
ed. “They figure they can get
enough goals, and they always
have been offensively ioriented
from the coach down.”

“But,” the coach continued, “I’d
be very surprised if anyone beat
us 7-0 (Akron beat Bowling Green
by that score), right now.”

Bemis believes that the team
may finally be ready to do some
winning, and that Tuesday’s deci-
sion over Kent State (see page 15) -7,.
helped them regain their confi-'
dence.

Kent State is in the OCSA, but
doesn’t play the Zips this year.
However, Akron did play one team
that challenged the booters——Ohio
U. Bemis’ kickers lost to the Bob-
cats, 3-0, a couple of weeks ago.
The same Bobcat squad was smash-
ed by, the strong Zip offense, 5-3.

That game uncovered one of Ak-
ron’s major problems. T h e one

Harriers Oppose Penn State  
In Top-Rate Eastern Rivalry  

by BILL NAAB
Cross Country coach Jim
Banner remarked, “Penn

State has a great squad, but
so do we.” The rugged Nit-

‘tany Lions visit the Schenley

Park course tomorrow morn-
ing. The freshmen run at
10:30, and the varsity squads
race at 11:00.

Banner indicated that his team
has been spending equal time be-
tween speedwork and distance
running in preparation for the
meet. The last few days, however,
the harriers have been running on
the long, hilly Schenley Park
course.

Record-breaker Jerry Richey re-
vealed_ that he believed that the
Penn'State meet will be excel-
lent preparation for the upcom-
ing IC4A’s..He remarked, “It’l1
be a big "boost if we win,
and everyone will do their best.”

Richey continued by saying
that opponents Steven Gentry
and Ray Smith are good runners,
“but if Paul Zink continues run-
ning well, we can place two run-
ners in front of .them.” Jerry ex-
plained why he believes that
Penn State is .‘mu_ch improved
since the beginning of the sea-
son. “Villanova killed Penn State.
Then Georgetwon slaughtered
Villanova, but just barely edged
Penn _State. So it looks as if Penn
State has come a long ways. They’ll
be the best team We’ve faced in
a dual meet.” '

Senior harrier Ken Lawton ex-
pects the meet to be much more
exciting than had been the case
last year, a 15-54 loss. “There’s
lots of difference between this

Besides Steve Gentry, the for-
mer PIAA record-holder, in the

mile, distanceman Ray Smith is

also highly regarded. Smith led
the Nittany ‘Lion runners across
the finish line in all but one dual
meet last season and finished fifth

inrthe IC4A championships. He’s

ratedamong the East's top cross
country runners.

Sophomore Mike Nolan be-
lieves that the meet will be rug-
ged for both sides. He commented
that the competition should be ex-
pecially tough because of the tense
rivalry between schools. He ad-
ded that Mike Schurko is the out-
standing sophomore of the Lion
squad. “When we beat the Penn
State freshmen last year, Schurko
was particularly impressive, “No-
lan related. Schurko, incidently
holds the Penn State frosh re-
cord in the mile.

Banner -remarked that sopho-
more Mark Vornhagen has been
steadily improving. Bannersaid,
“He’s looking real good, running

. better than he has all season.”

Banner will need a healthy
team, Vornhagen and Gred Rod-
gers included. As he said before,
his squad must perform at their
best in order to defeat the tough
harriers from Penn State.

Delts Capture IM Wins

Special to the Pitt News _
Delta Tau Delta picked up _two victories in fraternity “A”
football to remain a leading contender for the intramural cham-

pionship.

The Delts nipped Sigma Chi 7-0 this week, after edging previously
unbeaten Pi Lambda Phi 19-12 in last week’s action. In the latter game, ,
the victors jumped off to a 19 point lead in the first half and held

off the Pi Lams the rest of the way.

Pi Lam picked up a victory over
Delta Sigma» Phi, 13-6, this week,
in the double
elimination tournament. John
Kates took a 40-yard pass from Al-
lan Ginsburg in the final 18
seconds of play to score the win-
ning TD. Ginsburg scored the first

IC4As Ahead

Frosh Get Rugged

, The Canisius Invitational and -the Penn State dual meet con- ._
test are the two giant tests of the season for coach Jim Banner’_s

freshman cross country squad.

The freshmen finished a strong third at Canisius two weeks ‘ago;
and tomorrow face the powerful Penn State frosh. Even though, Bob
-Hagner and Dave Cobb are no longer hampered by injuries, Banner’-

Booters VVin
Second Tilt
At Kent State

Leo Bemis’ soccermen had
some fun Tuesday and, as a

result, they came home from.

Kent State with a 2-0 win,
their second in eight tries.

Bemis knew that something had
to be done if his squad was to
win again. He advised: “In the
last four games be loose, loose,
take some of the pressure off, and
have some fun.”

“And, they weren’t as_tight and
tense in the game,” the coach men-
tioned.

This may have been because
of one well-executed play that
came near the end of the. first
quarter. The hooters took the hall
the entire length of the field with
little trouble. Near the goal Bob
Trexler passed into Conference
Lekoma who led Dave DiEmido
with a perfect pass to the left of
the nets. DiEmido promptly scor-
ed from about five feet out.

Then, at 19:16 ‘of the second
period Lekoma hit with a penalty
shot, his third goal of the fall.

“Yes, they were just winning to
play soccer,” Bemis stated. “They
were settling the ball and pass-
ing well. They played as a team.”

The -kickers did play a good
team game. But, some of the in-
dividuals probed up to a slight
emergency that resulted from
the quitting of four players, _in-
cluding _Bob Quinlin one of the‘
team’s three scorers.

Norm Shulma, starting his first
game of the season, DiEmido,
Lekoma, and Randy Dry, a line-
man coverted to fullback, all
played their best game accord-
ing to Bemis.

of the Zips, yet, is the tiredness;
that overcomes them late‘ in the ,-
game. Often, they have jumped .
off to the quick, commanding leads
but have found themselves strug- 1
gling to protect the win late in the
final half. . -

“We can do the job,” Bemis said,
“as long as we keep putting -the "
pressure on. They aren’t terribly
aggressive. ‘ ‘

“They play a short-pass style,
they’re crisp and accurate. Then,"
they work slow, and keep the ball. {

The Zips use a 4-3-3 set-up,.
which could be.ideal for the kick-'
ers who should stay with thej5-1- A
3-1 formation. . ‘- ‘

“We should keep our composure ‘
and get the ball down the wings,
pass quick, and use centering a bit '
more,” Bemis explained. ‘ ‘ l
