 Comment on Nyden Case

BYVBILL MOORE
Noofﬁcial response to Faculty of

-Arts and Sciences (FAS) Dean

Jerome Rosenberg’s decision not to
follow the recommendations of the
F AS Tenure and Promotion’ Hearing
Board (TPHB) will be forthcoming,
according to TPHB chairman
Michael Margolis.

The TPHB issued a report two
weeks ago calling for formation of
an ad hoc committee which was

better qualiﬁed to review the"

dismissal of assistant sociology
professor Paul Nyden, but Rosen-

' berg responded with a nine-page

report "last week which concluded
that no further review was
necessary. The clean said he would
stand behind his earlier decision not
to renew the Marxist sociologist’s
contract, which expires at the end of
the current term. *

“The board has never in the past
made any official response,”
Margolis said over the weekend.
“We are an advisory board. We
give our report and that is it.”

Asked for his personal responses

_ to Rosenberg’s decision, Margolis,

an associate professor of political
science, said he still supported the
board’s recommendation. “I wish

the dean had followed the report,”
‘.‘But it’s basically his V
perogative. ’ ’

he said.

Economics professor David
Houston, a second member of the
ﬁve-man TPHB, said, however, that
he thought some responses would
be forthcoming from his colleagues,
“but I don’t know if the whole
committee will make it.” .

Houston indicated he, at least,
would be responding. “I don’t want
to say anything right now,” he said,
“but I think I will have something

later. I don’t want to go off

Dorm Room Bids Start Soon

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Room drawings for the fall term
in the University’s residence halls
will start on Sunday, March 6, for
the special units, according to
JoAnn Gibbs, assistant director of
the Office of Residence Life (ORL).
Drawings for rooms on coed ﬂoors
and intensive study floors will begin
at 2 p.m. and suite bidding will sta
at 4 p.m. '

Bidding on singles, doubles,
triples and quads will be held on
March 8 and 9. «

Gibbs said the lottery system will
be used, with seniors, juniors and
sophomores bidding in that order.
The lowest numbers will bid first in
each ' section. “Students who
attended the special orientation
‘sessions on the special units will be
given preference in the room
drawings,” Gibbs said. .
Room retention will take place
from March 1 through March 2.
Students wishing to- retain their
room for the following year must
have full occupancy—one student
cannot retain a double without a

Pitt Active in Energy Search

BY PETE BUTCH

The research and development of

‘alternative sources of energy have

been emphasized by Pitt’s School of
Engineering and other science
departments for the past three

years after trends started to] predict "

our current fuel crisis.

According to T. W. Sze, 'an
associate dean of the Engineering
School, “Basic research is being
conducted to make resource utiliza-
tionmore efficient, "its application
safer and environmental pollution
less.”

A research inventory compiled by
Sze last year, indicated 22 projects

and 29 are pending approyal of
grant requests. The projects
represent $4.73 million in research
funds. They are supported by
agencies of the federal and state
government and industry.

A survey ’of‘1Unive_rsity faculty’

with energy related interests,
compiled by engineering professor
B.S. Gottfried, totals 97 researchers
from 15 departments working in 11
resource categories.

The areas are coal mining, coal
other than mining,‘ oil and gas,
nuclear, economics and systems
analysis, electricity, solar, conser-
vation, conversion, environment
and transportation.

“Energy research is one of the

major thrusts in the Engineering '

School,” Sze said. “It has always
been a basic area for
departments of chemical engineer-
ing and electrical engineering.

partment has always dealt with

Engineering’s faculty expertise can
make the biggest contribution.

“The basic expertise was always
there,” he said, “but directed in
different application problems.
Work has been redirected and
concentrated a great deal on
energy, environmental and bio-
medical _related questions.’’

Sze cited Professor William
Rudoy, who experimented with air
conditioning but switched to the
energy conservation area, as an
example.

“The energy crisis has encourag-
ed a concerted effort from the
faculty to redirect their work_into
the energy area,” he said.

“The basic expertise remains
unchanged. In the .60’s it was
directed in space program related
problems. In the 70’s the expertise
is directed to the societal.related
problems,” he said.

In the College of Arts and
Sciences chemistry department,
research concentrates on improving

Fifth and Forbes Avenue areas.

“There has long been a feeling,
especially among Oakland resi-
dents, that there is a general lack of
interest or concern for the
community directly surrounding the
University,” Colgan said. “This
causes concern among residents in
that many decisions made by the

, University, that greatly affect the

community, are made independent-
ly,” she said.

training to realize his back was
broken when he was injured in the
Langley Hall explosion, his father,
Robert Cina Sr. says.

Cina Jr.‘, one of two seriously hurt
in the blast which killed two persons
and injured 68, was pinned in the
Langley rubble and asked for a

After the operation, Cina lay
immobile for two weeks to allow the
lesion to set before being ﬁtted with
a body cast. Friday, he was moved
to Harmarville for rehabilitation
therapy. I

“He does small arm exercises

Cina is well on the road to
recovery, but fellow student Greg

the 1 p.m. class scheduled for
Langley 221, is still in traction at
Presbyterian.

“Greg was sitting_ in the

Malzone, too, had a spinal fusion
and was set in a body cast last
Tuesday. But because of his broken
neck, he is wearing a collar and has
a circular traction piece (halo trac-
tion) attached to his head to keep it
immobile. The halo is ﬁxed to his
head by means of four bolts: two in
the front and two in the back of his
head. It may be four weeks before
he’s allowed to move, his mother
said.

“He was unconscious for three

BY NANCY J. WINTNER

The results of a.Brown University
study indicated that literary skills
can be improved by computerized
instruction. according to Robert
Scholes, an English professor at
Brown University.

The study, administered by
Scholes, Andries van Dam, a
computer scientist, and two grad-
uate teaching assistants, was ﬁrst
conducted during the. 19,75-1976
school ‘year and involved 12
undergraduate students.’ in an
introductory poetry course.
students used a computer and
television-like terminal for studying
purposes.

The computerized instruction
system—known as hypertext——con-
sists of a number of cross—referen-
ced documents which can be
retrieved in a matter of seconds by
typing messages on a computer
terminal.

Scholes said the study, sponsored
by the National Endowment for the
Humanities, was so effective that it
is being repeated with an additional
10 students. ,

“Students showed progress in

their ability to respond to poetry and ’

to interpret it better,” Scholes said.

“People were reading a lot more
and were more conscientious,” van
Dam said. “They were more
conscientious because they were
aware of the fact that the system is
one of a kind _and 'futuristic.’.’

Scholes said hypertext “freed:
students of the fear -of poetry”,

because it makes poetry relatively
easy to read and interpret.

Van Dam said, unlike a typical.

book of poetry, where poems can
only be read one at a time, hypertext
allows students to see several
poems or segments of poems at one
time "on a ‘TV’ screen. Students
consult the table of contents then

The .

Scholes and van Dam both
stressed that hypertext is not a
substitute for teachers. but rather a
homework device.

“It's not a substitute for
teaching," said van Dam. “but a
nifty adjoint to classroom ideas and
personal attention."

The largest drawback with using
computerized instruction. such as
hypertext. is the high expense, van
Dam said. This particular study
cost slightly over six dollars an
hour. In order to cut the costs, van
Dam said, hypertext would have to
be used for a large number of
students and courses.

Van Nostrand, chairman of
Brown’s English Department, Van
Dam said, told the New York Times
recently that he plans to use
hypertext for teaching written
courses, providing the University
receives the necessary financial
backing.

But inspite of the financial
drawbacks of computerized instruc-
tion, computers are being used as a
major learning device at Dartmouth
University.

“Dartmouth students treat com-
puters as a 1ibrary—and there are
no additional costs," van Dam said.
“As a result, Dartmouth has far
more literate arts and humanities
majors.”

He said he sees hypertext as the
future teaching tool at colleges. “In
the next -10-20 years, it has to be all
over the place.” A

Vast linkage with computers and
television screens is making it
cheaper per hour to employ
computerized instruction tools, he
said. No one could afford television
sets, at ﬁrst, he said, but once they
were produced in mass, the prices
declined. _ » . '

Pitt professors are taking oppo-
site views toward hypertext.

‘ ‘I don't know ifthey'd ever use it
at Pitt." Paul Zimmer. associate
director of the University Press
said. “Writing is a funny business.
It doesn't seem to me that
computers culd make a connection
that only an exceptional person
could make. If it does work. it will
be very interesting. Although, I
shudder to think of the day
computers begin to write poems for
us." .\ '

Dr. ‘Christopher Rawson, asso-
ciate chairman of Pitt's English
department, questioned hyper-
text's financial situation.

“If Pitt is going to spend money,
where are they going to take money
from?" he asked.

Editor’s note: The following is
the third in a series of articles

. dealing with the subject of women

and the law.
BY BETSY NORMAN

\

Women are especially inter-
ested in knowing their rights in the
area of domestic violence, primarily .
wife abuse, according to Atty. Pat
Miller of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU)._

Another area of large concern is
how .to handle the process of
reporting ,a rape, and just what
rights a woman has when she is
raped.

“Rape occurs when a person
engages in sexual intercourse with
someone not his’ spouse by force Or
the ‘threat of force. ‘Any
penetration, anal and oral as well as
vaginal, qualiﬁes asrape. Emission"
is not necessary,” states ACLU’s
“Women and the Law” pamphlet.

Rawson said that if Pitt is to
appropriate money. it should
perhaps be for the library or for
remodeling the Student Union.
“With all the needs there are for
money in the University. I would not
be able to give this a high priority."

Referring to a recent comment
made by Scholes in the “Cronicle
for Higher Education."...the com-
munication that they had with one

4 Pennsylvania law states that
both men and women can be victims

is a seconddegree felony. Statutory
rape is any ‘ kind, of sexual

was the large amount of writing the

“Writing was built up a great

said.

Hypertext, van Dam said, saves
students from scanning through
various materials which can be
quite time-consuming. Instead of
searching for Encyclopedia Britan-

pokes a button and seconds later the

“The only way hypertext can be
duplicated,” van Dam said, “is by

critique each other’s work, read the

"7/' Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Better Spent Elsewhere

It is difﬁciilt to ﬁnd something optimistic to say about Governor
Shapp’s budget for next year. _ .

First there was the educational appropriation that left Pitt. the other
state-related schools and the Philadelphia primary schools stuck with

. the sticky,end of the balance sheet.

Then, as one digs deeper, projects of exaggerated priority arise.
There is the department of transportation, PennDOT. A body so corrupt
their job applications leave a line for the signature of someone with
political clout within the state who is sponsoring the applicant. Their
budget is so large, they could bankroll a couple of universities.

The state legislature was seen as the avenging angel for students, the
people with the budgetary power and guts to stand up to the governor
and right his ﬁscal wrongs.

But that image of responsibility went down the drain last week when
the lawmakers started considering an expense allowance increase for
themselves. This gift comes via the Commonwealth Compensation
Commission, a group appointed to decide whether or not governors,
judges or other people too responsible to decide for themselves need a
payraise.

Their advice is as sound as one dieter telling another they deserve a
banana split since they had no french fries with their Big Macs at lunch.

This time around, the commission is considering an expense account
increase for the legislators and pay increases for cabinet members,
judges and party leaders in the legislature. That's to be added to the pay
raises and expense increases the commission stuffed in their paychecks

' last fall with little opposition by the house and senate.

What is really disappointing about this talk is that it comes at a time
when the money is desperately needed elsewhere—in secondary and

highereducation.

It is especially appalling when one realizes that to be a state
representative or senator is to be a part-time worker. Students are
full-tinie workers and no compensation commission ever comes to their
aid to help them meet expenses. . =

Only Governor Shapp and the legislature can stop the commission's
recommendations from becoming law. And judging from the budget he
presented. one knows not to expect Shapp to do the responsible thing
and axe the increases.

For the lawmakers not to consider the same, though, is a great

. disappointment. They are expected to stand up for the students, to ﬁnd

that money somewhere and turn it over to higher education. They found
themoney last fall. alright. but they kept it for themselves.

This cannot be allowed to happen again. There will be a commission
hearing on March 1 in Pittsburgh. The Student Government Board must
lead a contingent of concerned students to express the view that this
pay-raise is better spent elsewhere; ’

Students must show lawmakers more than tacit enthusiasm. The
legislators must be warned that if they wish to maintain the conﬁdence
of their constituents, they had better not let an expense hike like last
fall's pay increase slide through again. '

Twelve years ago today the
charismatic black activist Malcolm
X stepped up to the podium in the
Audobon Ballroom on Manhattan's
upper Broadway. On a bright
Sunday afternoon some 400 blacks
had jammed the crumbling hall to
hear one of the most articulate and
spellbinding orators of the twen-
tieth century.

In the stuffy room they looked on
a life that ‘had been as calamitous
and metamorphic as the American
civil rights movement would soon
prove to be. ‘Born Malcolm Little in
the heartland of Nebraska, he later
adopted the X to replace ‘ ‘the white

' slave-master name which had been

imposed upon my paternal forbears
by some blue-eyed devil."

As a youth he prided himself on
his reddish hair and light skin,
traces of his white maternal
But eventually he
wrote in an autobiography that
would serve as a personal bible to
many: “I was for years insane
enough to feel that it was some kind
of status symbol to be light-com-
plexioned. Now I hate every drop of

thatnwhite rapist’s blood that is in

me.

Malcolm's formal education went
as far as the eighth grade, when he
sojourned to New York in the
mid-40's. He prowled with the best
of pimps. his hair straightened by
"conking" with lye. his zoot-suits
pressed. and his shoe toes yellow.
He was soon hustling full time and

pushing marijuana. Cocaine
became a $20-a-day staple for him
and he took to burglary. In 1946 he
was hit with a 10-year rap in
Boston. End chapter one. _

‘ In prison he developed an interest
in the Nation of Islam (Black
Muslims). He also wanted‘ to
improve his vocabulary, so he

copied a dictionary from A to Z.

Paroled six years later, he left
Malcolm Little, to rot in his
slime-filled tomb and sent a
resurrected Malcolm X to the
Harlem streets and inevitably the
six o'clock news.

The comparisons between Mal-
colm and Martin Luther King were
to be expected. King was cast as the
establishment Negro, while X was
ﬂaunted across TV screens by’ the 4*
networks as a dangerous counter-
racist, one who believed in an
international revolution of non-
whites. I

Even the X struckfear in the ’

minds of whites, as if to signify
some unknown, perhaps volatile,
quantity which some day might
explode, whereas the name King
was safe. It was «familiar,
non-threatening; it was white. He
even had a “Jr. ’ ’ tacked on—ahaaa,
a family man.

Malcolm’s involvement with the
Islam produced an even more alien
aura about him. The pilgrimage to
Mecca. the fez worn by Elijah
Muhammed, the daily ablutions
toward the East.

But Malcolm returned from his
pilgrimage with a revised philos-
ophy toward the races. There could
be reconciliation, he said.
‘He moved. albeit unevenly. for

community between blacks and
whites.

The new Malcolm X was
compassionate, soft-spoken, yet
ever captivating—as if part of a

A grand design. He had aroused his

people, built some backbone into
them and now he was ready to sit
down as leader and father of a
frantic nation—sit down with
another nation which had never»
been his because in turn “I have
never been an American.”

And so the 400 blacks in the
Audobon Ballroom came to hear
when and where. They had rolled
through the changes with Malcolm,

arming themselves first, now,

preparing to live with the whites,
notibreak with them.

Malcolm X cried ﬁnally, “As_-
salaam alaikum” 1 (Peace be unto
you), and his avid listeners replied,
“Wa-alaikum salaam” (And unto
you be peace). -

A disturbance broke out in one of
the front rows, catching Malcolm’s
attention. “Now brothers!” he
cried, “Be cool, don’t get excited,”
when three men rushed down an
aisle and opened ﬁre on the speaker
eight feet away.

A double-barreled sawed-off
shotgun, a .45- and a .38-caliber
pistol bludgeoned Malcolm’s chest,
throat, thighs and legs.

Some say Elijah Muhammed was
behind it. Others say the whites.

Twelve years to the day later
they’d be celebrating Great Ameri-
cans Day. From the hard roads from
which he came. and down the new
paths he may have led, Malcolm
lived and died his way into history.
For what he was and what he dared

. and threatened to be, he. today is

remembered.

Presidency—More Than Image

. BY CASEY BAER

“The‘New Spirit of Jimmy Carter
is sweeping across the nation. Men.
women and children alike are all
inspired by the very humility of this
man who rejects the trappings of
power and wealth to serve in the
best intcrestsofthe ‘common man.’
Business and labor both are
optimistic over the prospects of his
presidency and his spirit has
wrought him and his nation the
respect of world leaders."

Were these statements true.
there might be good reason to
accept and encourage the image
which our President has for the last
month attempted in vain to project.
That image--one of a farmer who
-elevates himself beyond the realms

 

of vanity and power, retaining the -
_ability to think and act as the

common man would have him think
and act-—has produced little more
than skeptical interest on the part of
a nation that has been subjected to
political imagery for decades.
There is little doubt that it was
this imagery which won the election
for Mr. Carter. but he can scarcely
expect it to carry him through a
demanding and critical four-year
administration. Thus far. Mr.
Carter has produced little more than
a mixture of hick-imagery and
previously successful political tech-
niques and phraseology (i.e.—his

desecration of the ﬁreside chat of '
of Trumani

FDR and revival
one-liners such as "'1-”he'Bucl<V'Stops

. Herel"). ‘It appears. in fact.._that .

Carter "is a master of American
political image techniques. With
his rhetoric, he has been able to sell
himself without making any major‘
commitments or sacriﬁces to the
American people. One wonders
how he will fare. however, .in the
international system, where his
record and personal qualiﬁcations,
and indeed maybe his durability
and judgment under pressure. will
be of much more interest to his
world leader peers than his “down
on the farm ‘honesty’."

The fact seems to be that
President Carter could prove to be a
very capable and responsible’
leader. Yet to be recognized in an
overall perspective as a great or

Amateur Group Seeks
  Vinyl Path to Riches

BY KEN GORMLEY

Did you ever ﬂick on the radio.
lean back and dream of becoming a
famous «recording artist? Did you
ever have a feeling in your gut that,
with a cheap guitar or 50 cent kazoo,
you could make better music than
the stuff that grinds out of 13-Q?
My friends and I are far from
being professional musicians.
(Whenever we get together to play.
our guests quickly remember they
have dentist appointments. And
passing stray dogs howl moumfully
in back alleys.) '-
But we were sure we could make a
better recording than most of these
' new disco bands that earn millions
of dollars warbling about carwashes
and rubberband men.
The music industry is a goldmine.
And we wanted a chunk of it.

HOW IT’S DONE

The first step to becoming a
rich, famous musician is to cut a
“demo tape.” So we cleaned the
dust off our instruments and made a
date ata local recording studio.

Where did four starving musi-
cians get enough money to visit one
of these high-priced studios, you
might wonder. Did we sell our
sisters into slavery, or worse?

Nope. Luckily for our sisters, we
had discovered a homemade

,_ recording studio in the basement of

a Pitt student's home. Ten dollars
an hour is a mighty cheap price to
pay to make a professional
recording—especially when it’s
going to make you a millionaire.

. We loaded up our instruments-

an electric piano, three acoustic -

guitars and a set of Ricky Ricardo
bongo drums—and headed for the
home of Bruce Lichtenstein.

THE RECORDING STUDIO

‘‘It’s probably just a bathroom
equipped with two cassette record-
ers,” I grunted as we unloaded our

equipment in front of the small East‘
McKeesport home.

“Good, ' ’ our ever-talented lead
guitarist snickered. ‘‘If we ﬂush the
toilet every once in a while, it might
improve the quality of our music."

But the recording room was no ‘

latrine. The basement of the
Lichtenstein house had been
converted into an honest-to-good-
ness studio.

There were microphones allover
the place, a soundproof equipment
room with a glass window and a sign.
that flashed “Shhh. . .Rec<n'ding” at

appropriate times. . o It was like

’ -isomething .-.you’ve “seen, inean " Elvis’

..Presle 4 movie

       

It didn't take us long to set up.
We were anxiousto get started (and
finished). We didn't want to,
prolong the agony for poor Mr.
Lichtenstein.

“Okay," Lichtenstein‘s voice
blared from a microphone, as he-
stood behind the window in the
soundproof room. “Ready with the
first song?"

We were as ready as we'd ever‘
be. The three guitarists tuned their
instruments and I nervously
plunked away at my piano to get
warmed up (I had taken piano
lessonsin my grade school and high
school d_ays. My _friends often
compare me to Beethoven. They
say I play about as well as
Beethoven did, after he went blind
and deaf.)

"The “Shhh...Recording” sign
ﬂashed on and we went through our
ﬁrst three songs—“South City
Midnight Lady” (an old Doobie
Bros. tune), “Melissa" (by the
Allman Brothers) and “Tequilla
Sunrise” (the Eagles).

Lichtenstein played them back to
us. Something was desperately

wrong—-we sounded pretty good.

[Our normally raspy voices came out
with a clear echoey effect.

And the instrumentals sounded
like real music. (A big surprise,
since they usually sound more like a
herd of bleating sheep stampeeding

A to their feeding trough).

Now it was time for our
blockbuster——the tune that was
going to put. our names up in
lights—the tune that would have
thousands of teenyboppers begging
for a lock of our underarm hair.

We wrote the song in a flash of
inspiration (or was it delerium?) at
2:30 a.m. the previous morning.

With Lichtenstein assisting usvon

bass guitar, our. heads started
bobbing, our feet began tapping
and we recorded a near-ﬂawless

version "of the catchy tune that’

would make us stars...

BY KAREN KADILAK

The implementation of the study
of sports within all a university’s
departments was one of the topics
discussed by Michael Novak, author
of the best-selling book, ‘ ‘The Joy of
Sports,” during a lecture Thursday
at the S.U. ballroom.

The lecture, “In Sports We
Trust,” was co-sponsored by the
Univer_sity Chaplains and the
Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation.

“Sports is such an important
reality of human life that it ought to
be studied thoroughly,” Novak
contended. “It'should be studied
through literature." It should be
studied through communications. It
should be studied from sociology

‘ and psychology, through philos-
ophy and religious studies through
anthropology. lt’s such a pervasive
study for all the departments of the
university to study. "

“The American public apprecia-
tes sports, but it doesn't have an
understanding of sports,” Novak
continued. “It doesn't have a great
intellectual theory about sports.
And that means that the university
is failing in half its mission. And
that’s bad. The university is
incomplete without the other half. ”

Novak also discussed athletic-

recruiting and the black eye it has
received as a result of what he
‘implied to be some unwarranted

‘muckrakingi on the f part of‘.

misinformed‘ journalists. V

\ -‘‘l-Jnder the -table tl_1,_i_ngsr=_are11’t

the illegal payments and induce-

ments often given to college
athletes. ‘

“They’re dishonest. But good.
students are also recruited.

Harvard spends a lot of money
recruiting the best students. Well,
in the same way, there’s nothing
wrong with recruiting the best
athletes. And the best way to do it is
above the table. \

“Being an athlete is a profession
like being an accountant or being a
lawyer, or being a doctor,” he said.
“The competition to get into the
best places is very keen and the
competition to get the best talent
into the best places is very keen.

“If the newspapers looked into
the recruiting practices of college
‘faculties trying to hire other faculty
members, they’d find a lot to write
about just like they ﬁnd a lot about
athletic recruiting.

Novak also talked about Pitt's
number one ranking and the assets
he feels that the University can
ultimately gain as a result of that

. ranking in non-athletic-related

areas.

“One of the great powers in the
world is publicity, ” Noval commen-
ted. “It’s even more powerful than

money because money can't always

buyit. ,

‘ ‘It raises everyone’s morale to be
associated with the best, if only for a
moment. After all, this may pass.

could make the University say ‘Let’s

“We face our most serious

He explained that money provi-

has been limited.

“The policy of the ,Energy

istration (ERDA) is to support
research representing only minor
variations of existing technology.
That's why solar energy has not

Carter to offer his philosophies on
the direction the energy search
should take.

Sze feels that solar energy
research will require increased
attention but cannot be developed
fast enough or in quantitites large
enough to fill the gap economically.

“The problem is that the cost of
solar energy is not commercially

MAKING IT BIG

“I'd like to help you,” the fellow

‘ from KQV answered, scratching his

chin. “But half the station
employes would lose their jobs if I
played that on the radio."

It looked bad. KQV couldn’t play
our smash hit, because “then every
two-bit band in the city would
demand equal air time." ;
‘ But the guy felt bad—he wanted
to help us out. So he arranged for

me to play the tape for Marci, a
WDVE disc jockey. V

Itwas no use. Marci took one
good listen to the tape and offered
her condolences. “Have you tried
submitting it to the WDVE comedy
hour?” - _

“I guess the Beatles started out
this way too,” I muttered, and
trudged out the door.

I‘ was desperate now. The tape
had to be played—-so that a few
thousand fans could call in and send
“Crahee Disco Downs” skyrocket-
ting up the charts.

Oh well, I decided. Might as well
do my school a favor and let it be the
ﬁrst to air the song. , Ifpresented the
tape to WPGH and (naturally) they
agreed to play it.

“Better keep your phones open,’ ’
I advised them. “You’ll probably
be swamped with calls.”

It was late Sundav night, at some
hour unfit for msomniacs, that

 

“Crahee Disco Downs” made ‘its
debut. _

And, just as I suspected, the
phones rang all‘night. People all
over campus wanted to know where
the strange radio signals were

coming from. China? Eastern
Mongolia? '
THE BEAT GOES ON

The next time you flick on the
radio, lean back and dream of
becoming a famous recording
artist—keep right on dreaming.

Sure, the music industry is a
goldmine. But only a few lucky
people get a chunk of the treasure.

Only a few musicians will ever
become as rich and famous as I’m
going to be...when “Crahee Disco
Downs" makes it to the top of the
charts.

More than a Sixties’ Rebirth

BY JIM FARERI

Ramones

Leave Home

Sire SA7528
Sparks Big Beat
Columbia P034359

Since the death of the 60's protest
music and the consequent ﬂowering
of apathy, no one is looking for
anything in music but music.
Nothing wrong with this—although
when thinking artists can no longer
ﬁnd audiences, and AM radio
appeals only to the lobotomized,
well, it gets a bit frightening.

Groups like Sparks and the
Ramones have not only evoked the
60's tradition of music as popular
philosophy, but have gone a step
further and transformed them-
selves into symptoms of weak spots
in modern culture. And they
haven't gone so far out as to forget
about entertaining—“Big Beat”
and “Leave Home” are as
listenable as “Frampton Comes

Alivel,” and a hell of a lot more
refreshing too.

The Ramones have been wrongly
dismissed as an archaic rebirth of
the 60's pop phenomena. Their
wonderful, superfast, all-chord pop
music, cast into tasty little
two-minute morsels that follow each

other like machine-gun ﬁre, is not -

intended to please old Herman's
Hermits’ fans.

‘ ‘Leave Home's” lyrics are full of
confusion and paradox, veiled by
naive language and simple subject
matter. The irony created,
especially by the contrast between
the supposedly innocent pop music
and the outrageously twisted
situations of the lyrics, is aimed at
producing ill-at-ease if not hysteria.

The Ramones’ existential world is
so disheveled, unpredictable and
irrational that nothing like order,
logic, or even consistency ever has a
chance. Everything is in insane

contradiction (“First rule is: the
V laws of Germany/ Second rule is: be

e o mommv”) and we are caught

  

inescapably in the middle. Find
anything like this on a Herman's
Hermits’ album.

Sparks covers approximately the
same territory as the Ramones, but
as the Ramones come off as 60-ish
punks, Sparks makes mocking

pretensions of class and reﬁne-

ment.
For “Big Beat,” composer Ron
Mael has scrubbed most of the

SPARKS

keyboards, hired Tuff Darts’
guitarist Jeff Salen and brought
more rock'n’roll into Sparks than
ever before. Mael has also’ grown
more distraught with the world and
has created a childlike, but
visionary, persona to sing his
bitterly satiric songs of the
alienated man.

“Big Beats,” lyrics tell the story
well: “Nothing To Do,” “Screwed
Up,” “Everybody’s Stupid,”
“Confusion." The lyrics sharpen
Mael’s picture of contemporary
man with their keen little razor
sharp insights: we know just what
Mael is saying when his high-pitch-
ed brother Russel croons “no-
thing’s blowin’ in the wind," or

supposes that “If I had a million.

thumbs/I'd twiddle, twiddle/But I
just have two."

The greatest achievement of both
albums is the balance struck
between good, original musici n-
ship and pertinent, aggressive
statement. These two usually don't
blend well and it is a pleasant

IIE RAMONE; A

surprise to ﬁnally see them working
symbiotically.

Both LPs are not isolated
phenomena, but part of a trend at
last touching popular music after-
sweeping through art and litera-
ture. These albums are truly signs
of the times, burrowing their roots
to the heart of man's problems in
the 70’s and reaching depths that

the 60's never fathomed.

     
  

 

Interview

 

Playing Because They Care

I BY M.PATRICK MONAHAN .

lt’s amazing to ﬁnd Steve Hillage
and Clive Bunker, two English
musicians with extremely different
personalities and philosophies,
playing together in the same band.

Talking to the bearded and
emancipated Hillage is not unlike
talking to a flower child straight out
of the psychedelic 60's. He ‘is a
guitarist who lives comfortably with
notions of the New Age, electric
gypsies, healing music, cosmic
symbols, global awareness, ancient
vibrations, angels, rock‘n’roll and,
oh yes, he believes in them all
wholeheartedly.

Bunker, on the other hand, is
more “down to earth" and
reserved. The quiet and extremely
competent drummer played with
Jethro‘Tull from '68 up until the
release of the classic “Aqualung”
album in '71.

Both men were found-Thursday
night at the Civic Arena where
Hillage's band opened the show for
the Electric Light Orchestra and
Journey.

“l'm deﬁnitely a musician who is
looking toward the future,” Hillage
said. the words dripping slowly
from his thin lips. “Maybe I won’t
ever be considered a success in the

» commercial terms of the music

business because I'm so different.
“However, there are always
people willing to open their ears to t

Bowie’s Newest More   .

Pointless than Ever

BY TOM WASELESKI

Low
David Bowie
RCA Records, CPL 1-2030.

“The European man is here. I
rnustlbe only one in a million,”
David Bowie sang in his 10-minute
song of myself, “Station to
Station.”

 

DAVID BOWIE

And maybe he had a point.
Just as it seemed Bowie was
becoming too commercial and too
‘easily deﬁnable, i.e. soul on this
album, heavy metal on that one, he
serves up a record called “Low, ’ ’ an

new music. My role is to try and
synthesize all kinds of different
strands as much as possible to unify
many different ideas. I’d like a
jazz-rock element, ultra-ultra-
spaced-out element, a rocking lead
guitar and an” alternative society
element to all be a part of it.”

Bunker was shaking his head
every time Hillage started to get
into his cosmic rap. Bunker seemed
to be saying that Hillage might be
hoping for too much this time.

“The band I'm playing with here
is really different,” the stocky and
blackbearded Bunker said. “All of
these people ‘are so well educated
and knowledgeable in all aspects of
playing music, but they are really
like babies. "

It was strange when Bunker up
and left Tull right at the time when
they were moving into the superstar
ranks of rock n’roll. The media said
it was due to personality conﬂicts
with Tull’s mastermind, the ﬂam-
boyant Ian Anderson. Bunker
assured me that this was rubbish.

“I always got along well with Ian
Anderson," said Bunker. “At the
time of ‘Aqualung’ I was about to be
married to a girl who wasn’t into
music at all, plus, I bought into a
very lucrative factory business in
England.

“I 'had been touring and
recording with Tull at a treacherous
pace for three years. d1dn’t
feel as if I was getting anything out

  B ” 7"" D""'t 69* i"th°.,.Gl'99.V¢i

/:

ll-track disc that would've sounded
certain death for a new artist. But
Bowie’s too much of a staple to do
himself in with a single LP.

Besides, Bowie has a knack for
being ahead of his time. Take 2'»
“Space Oddity” (“...ground con-
trol to Major Tom...”). Released in
England in 1967. A hit in the U.S.
four years (count ’em) later.

What about the . “Pin-Ups”
album? Released in 1974, it was a
deplorable collection of Bowie’s
favorite oldies done in his (then)
unmistakable glitter style. Within a
year everyone was massacrmg
oldies——including John Lennon-
unmercifully.

So now we have. “Low,” perhaps
as dissonant and brutally pointless ":-
as Bowie’s ever been. But who's to
say that two years from now every
cut that spins off any black vinyl disc
won’t sound like this?

David serves up. two different fxsﬂl
styles here, though. Ifyou hate one.
you might be able to stomach the
other. But then again you might
hate both of them.

On side one seven short cuts (two
.of them instrumentals) blare,
sometimes to the point of pain.

The instrumentals on this side are

. probably the best cuts on the album.

(Continzted on Page 

is

of my career at that time.”

Bunker was bafﬂed at the
mentality of the industry and the
fans when he quit Tull. He was
upset that he could go onstage and
play ' horrendously some nights
without people caring or knowing
the difference.

“When you reach a certain level
with a band, people will absolutely
ﬂip out, no matter how bad you
play,” Bunker said, “and with Tull
it was starting to get that way. We
were hot, and people were loving us
no matter what we did. But as a
musician, I think it is a healthy

_ situation when you have to prove
yourself. You feel much better and
you’re always motivated to reﬁne
your craft.”

/1.)

.3;

“The only reason I joined Steve's
band was the desire to get back into
music,” Bunker said. “My
business interests are still doing
very_well. It was never a strictly
money thing.”

Hillage interjected, "‘I can’t
understand it when people continue
to play music that is absolute
rubbish just because they’re
rewarded with a fat paycheck.

And so the interview ended. The
experienced pro and the naive but
optimistic rookie were making their
ﬁrst visit to the States. Two men

game, the Panthers came up with a

Larry Harris and steady freshman
guard Sonny Lewis for the entire

which were officially termed

It was the second straight game

BY JIM LEWIS

The program handed out at the Pitt-Penn State wrestling match
Saturday contained a good article on a Panther wrestler taken from a
press release issued by the Pitt Sports Information Ofﬁce. The article
was so good. it reminded me of Friday, January 21, 1977. 0

That's the day the Pitt News ran a similar article which I wrote.

When I read the program article, I was shocked. It was not written by
me. yet it contained the same information and ideas my article did and

was credited to someone else! The author (whose.byline appeared at the

end of the work) covered the exact topics (though not in exact words) I
covered when I interviewed the very same Panther wrestler and called it
his own. original idea-—even though my piece was printed before the

author held the interview.

The author never told me that his article closely resembled mine; he
never asked if it was okay to have the article, which looked so much like
my own creation. released all over the city. perhaps all over the country.
Instead. the author submitted his article to the Sports Information

— Office. which never bothered to check and see ifthe idea had been used

 before. Unfortunately. it had.
Due

_/

to this author's and the Sports

Information Office's

irresponsibility, someone is getting credit for an interview which I have
already done and had printed. All over the country, this person's name
is associated with an article which may not have been an original idea-
which may have been a carbon copy of my own.

I asked the wrestler in question when the author got in touch withhim.
He claimed that he was interviewed “sometime around the Clarion

match——either just before or just after.‘

The Clarion match was on

February 2. My article appeared almost two weeks before.
Could the author have read my article and taken questions from it

instead of creating new ones? Did the author use my story as an exact

model just to meet a deadline? If that was.the case. then the author's

actions could be labeled plagiarism.

To say that I'm upset is an understatement. lfthc Sports Information
Office wanted an interview with that particular wrestler done in that
pan icular vein. they could have asked me for mine. instead of accepting

an obvious pseudo of my work.

Hopefully this will never happen again. Hopefully one of its authors
(Sports Information Office representatives. no less) won't make another
mistake like this. Hopefully the Sports Information Office will check to

,3 see if its‘ press releases resemble articles already printed‘ in a
' iie\\:spapei'—'—and if they ‘still insist on running them. toat least give

downs on or off the court. This isn't
the Larry Harris show or the Sonny
Lewis show, we have certain rules
and the rules were broken.”

The game itself seemed to be a
replay of so many previous Field
House losses this year: the recent
66-63 overtime loss to Duquesne;
the 75-71 loss to Massachusetts; the
81-77 loss to Rutgers; the 62-61 loss
to Virginia, etc., etc. The Panthers
somehow managed to lose each
game in the closing minute, despite
numerous opportunities to win.

Coach John Bach's Nittany Lions
raised their ECBL record to 4-5 and
are 10-14 on the season. Chris
Erichsen, playing only his fourth
game after missing 11 contests with
an ankle injury and sporting a
protective face mask, burned the
Panthers for 22 points (his third
consecutive 20-plus performance)

I 0' I and hauled down nine rebounds.

While Erichsen was getting his
22, an unknown freshman guard,
5-10 Bob Dulin, shocked the
Panthers by connecting on 10. of 12
tries from the ﬂoor, mostly on
medium-range jumpers, to ﬁnish
with 20 points (one more than he
had totaled thus far on the season).

State shot an unreal 73 percent in
the second half, including nine of
their final 10 shots, and for the
game connected on 36 of 58 ﬁeld
goals for an excellent _62.percent.

Harris started the second half and
poured in 19 markers to leadva Pitt
rally. Lewis entered with 15:35 to
go in the game and hit four of seven

' shots, contributing nine points.

Down by nine early in the second

- half, Pitt fought back to a 61-61 tie

on a Scott Nedrow jumper with 7:28

to play. Nedrow enjoyed his finest

offensive night of the year to lead
the Cats with 20 points, including

-s.i.x. in. the ﬁ.na.1...minut._e.s.

Pitt grabbed the lead for the ﬁrst
time after intermission as the
rejuvenated Harris canned a 22-foot
jumper at 6:48 for a 63-61 Pitt
advantage.

But the Panthers again fell back,

Pitt assistant hockey coach Bob
Klemz may not be a Henry
Kissinger, but he did manage to
curtail most of the expected
bloodshed when the Panthers, now
11-3-1. outmaneuvered Gannon
College, 10-6, Friday night in Erie.
Based on the bloody, game-end-

ing brawl of two years ago at the
Alpine Arena in Swissvale, this
rematch was expected to be a
preview of World War III on ice.
But the Panthers proved they no
longer include the fight-seeking
troops of years past.

“We were happy to get out of
there," Klemz said. “I’ve been up
there before and it's chop-chop.

Applying the pressure to an enemy goalkeeper, Pitt’s Jeff Saunders
I9] moved from his wing position to fill a gaping hole on defense and

When Gallick starts swinging, I
know something‘s the matter
because he’s intent on playing 100
percent hockey."

Aside from a number of roughing
calls, there was only one ﬁght in the
game-—involving Pitt defensemen
Larry Gallick and Gannon’s Mike
Sanberg. Because of shoulder and
hand injuries to defenseman Bob
Stein. the Panthers dressed only
four defensemen, so the loss ‘of
Gallick for seven minutes -(on
roughing and ﬁghting calls) hurt the
Pitt back line.

Klemz's solution was putting
winger Jeff Saunders, who has not
seen much action lately, on defense
with Bob Arturo. “Without that
help there, we could have been in
trouble," Klemz said. “Jeff did a
good job on defense. I would give

_ him the accolade.”

After Jim Wayne and Dave Elson
tallied ﬁrst period goals 21 seconds
apart to give the Panthers an early
2-0 lead, Tom Sherwin raised the

SC01_'€.t0 3-1 in the opening minutes 4

of the second frame. From there, it
was a barrage of goals led by Curt
Hetz and Bill Gedeon, who banged
home four and three, respectivelv.
Hetz’s‘ big -output gave the
sophomore center 26 goals on the
season, high on the Pitt team.
Gannon fought back to tie, 3-3, in
the second period, but two goals in.
46 seconds by Hetz and one by‘
Gedeon put Pitt on top again, 6-3,
going into the ﬁnal frame. Hetz

missed his first attempt as Mike
Rice cleared the boards for Pitt and
the Panthers quickly signalled for a
timeout, their last, at 0:03.

I F loormen Easy Pickup

BY CRIS HALL

A few weeks ago, after Penn

State's basketball team had defeat-
ed Pitt, 74-60, in a particularly
lackluster exhibition at State
College, Panther forward Wayne
Williams was moved to remark,
‘;‘they (Penn State) couldn't come to
the Field House and beat a good
pickup team.”
_ Strong stuff, especially coming
from a member of a 4-19 team. And
the reason Pitt is 4-19, and not 4-18,
as they were before Saturday night,
is that Penn State invaded the Field
House and conquered not a pickup
team, but Williams and his
teammates.

But that loss, one of a string of
hope-dashing losses that is proving

‘embarrassing, wasn’t enough to

silence Williams or his teammates.

To be sure, Pitt had taken Penn
State to the wire—the wire that is
choking Tim Grgurich and his team
as they continue to register close
losses to teams they should beat.
But it was hard to remember that
these were members of a 4-19 team
depreciating teams to which they
had fallen.

‘‘It shouldn't have even been
close." said Williams Saturday
night. “We should have ran them
right off the court—and shot them
off, too. But they were hot in the
second half..."

The Lions shot almost 70 percent
in the last 20 minutes, spoiling a
valiant effort by Larry Harris to
shoot Pitt back into the ball game.
Harris didn't harm his season’s
scoring average of 23.7 as much as
one might have expected, pouring
19 points into a Pitt attack that
faltered in the first half as Harris
assumed a disciplinary seat on the
bench.

It is Harris’ recent emergence as
a truly dangerous offensive perfor-
mer that could give Pitt a reason to
travel to Philadelphia for the ECBL

FORE WARNING

The spring edition of the 1977 Pitt
golf team will hold an organizational P
meeting 4 p.m. Monday at the Field
House, according to Coach Steve
Petro. Procedures for team
selection will be discussed. For-

tournament. And, if conﬁdence
counts, the Panthers could have
cause to stay longer than the
ﬁrst-day eliminations.

“I don't think we should have any .

problems in Philadelphia,” said
Williams, a 6-2 forward with
remarkable leaping powers and
hopes that rise even higher than he.

“We've played every team that will
be there close, but we haven't won
(Pitt is 0-9 in the ECBL). I ﬁgure
something has to give somewhere-
and Philadelphia seems like a good
place for things to give."

" “We’re capable of beating
everyone in -that group,” echoed
freshman Ed Scheuermann. “It’ll
take a good effort, but we're
deﬁnitely capable of taking it.”

“‘lt” being a spot in the NCAA

tournament. .

The NCAA tourney. For Pitt, it's
possible, though not probable. Lis-
tening to this band of youthful
optimists and its recently subdued,
though still enthusiastic, coach, can
cause the mind to wander through
the realm of what we wish to

happen. Maybe it is because none .

of them knows any better, but this
team thinks it's going places sooner
than most people expect.

Most people admit this team will
be a good one sometime, but these
players think sometime is tomor-

row, and maybe that's not so bad. '

Panthers could go 12-22 and win the
NCAA championship? They have.

what he thought of their "no-call
on the previous play.

After order was restored, Erich-
sen stepped to the line, missed his
first attempt and had his second
nullified when Jefferson was
spotted in the lane too soon giving
the Panthers yet another chance to
tie. Pitt again tried the long pass,
Nedrow ﬁring long but straight into
the arms of Jefferson, who dribbled
away the ﬁnal two seconds and the
Panthers’ flickering hopes.

The question that

real offensive threat, out of the

nearly 31 per game in his last ﬁve
contests, accounting for 45 percent

lnhospitable Wolverines
Cop Central Collegiates

BY DAVE MCDONALD

ANN ARBOR—The University
of Michigan, host of the 51st annual
Central Collegiate Conference
Track Championships, wasn’t very
congenial to the other teams this
weekend, as the Wolverines
captured most ofthe medals and
claimed the ﬁrst place team trophy
for themselves. ' ~

The Wolverines took ﬁrst place in
the 16-team battle with their
overwhelming 148 points, ‘followed’
by Eastern Michigan with 114, Penn
State (66), Air Force (63), Kentucky
State (37), Kent State (32) and Pitt
in the seventh spot with 31 tallies.

Track fans in the two-year-old
tennis and track facility witnessed
ﬁve conference record-breaking
performances . :

Mel Boyd and Keith Taylor were
the big scorers for the Panthers. On

,Friday night’ Boyd anchored the

mile (4:08) for a second-place ﬁnish

ning the other three legs were Rich

The worries ended, however,
when Hetz (one) and Gedeon (two),
put in three insurance goals late in
the third period to send Gannon to

“The ofﬁciating at Philadelphia
was sluggish, but this was the
worst,” he said. “Our fellows were
afraid to go out and hit somebody
because they were afraid of_being
called for penalties. I~had« a hard
time keeping our guys under
composure. We played mostof the
game short-handed.” -

The Panthers had six penalties
called on them before Gannon had
its ﬁrst and were outwhistled, 11-8,
forcing goalie Larry Newill to come
on strong and kick out what Klemz
termed as “four sure goals.”

“Regardless of the score, he
made a lot of saves that should have
been goals,” Klemz said.

Pitt Matmen Speechless

BY MARK MURPHY

What can a coach say after his
team has failed to win since January
15, has lost six matches in a row by
an average margin of 22 points and
has been crippled by injuries? Not a
whole lot, as Pitt wrestling coach
Dave Adams proved after his club’s
42-5 annihilation at the hands of
Penn State Saturday at the Field
House. -

“We couldn’t make any moves
today,” Adams said shrugging his
shoulders. “We didn’t talk about
Penn State that much duringthe

‘week. We are just trying to get the

top performances and the best
techniques out of everyone.”

In the past few, weeks the
Panthers have only had winning
performances from a handful of
people and as a result have fallen

5'’ from an unbeaten, nationally-rank-

ed team to one that is now below the
.500 mark at 5-6.

The visiting Lions started off the
afternoon as they ﬁnished it some
two hours later, picking up six

'A_ points at the expense of Pitt. At 118

lbs., undefeated Mike DeAugus-
tino, 10-0 going into the Pitt match,
made Panther Bill Clark victim
number 11, pinning the lightweight
at the 3:30 mark. .

-‘ ‘Jackie Kline (a winner last week
at 118) was hurt Thursday night,”
Adams said. “Billy Clark did a
great job just making the weight.
He pulled down from 132 pounds
Thursday night.”

In the 126-pound match, Pitt’s

“"1Iose Martinez- continued to give

Adams one of his few reasons for
smiling as he deadlocked State’s
Ray Frantz 5-5, picking up the two
tying points in the last minute.
“Jose has been coming along real
well each match,” the Pitt coach

‘H

 

praised. “He is definitely our most
improved wrestler.”

Martinez’s two points were all the
Panthers could muster until the 167
match when unbeaten Skip Bolin
squeezed by his opponent 5-3. In
the four intervening matches, the
Lions won two by fall and two by
decision, sending Pitt down'to its
sixth straight loss.

“We have been giving away a
minimum ofll points each match at
142 and -150,” Adams lamented.
“That sort of thing has been killing
us.”

Bolin’s last minute takedown of
Ashley Swift allowed the Panther
middleweight to keep his undefeat-
ed status (14-0) and give Pitt three
points out of its total of five.
However, the hosts handed the
Lions six big ones right back when
Panther Don Amdt forfeited at 177.

“Arndt’s really been hurting,”

« Adams explained. “He has had a

sprained neck. Why throw a guy in

BERKELEY, Calif. (AP)—Can-
