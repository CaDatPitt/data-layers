' . BALKAN TROUBLE;

Student Whose Home Is 1 in Greece
Writes Special Article for
The Weekly.

 

The following is the first install-
menh of a series of articles on the
Balkan situation byC. E. Diamond,

A ’l’5 :. ' '

Ever since. the fall of Constanti-
nople, the Christian people inhabiting
the Balkan peninsula - Greeks, Bul-

‘garians, lServians, Montenegrins,
Roumanians—wer.e conquered by the
most barbarous and most atrocious
race--the Turks. The Turks have
;since considered the Christian as a
slave, and tried 1:3 treat him as such
The*Christian was never equal before

the ,Turk« courts; his life‘ was not

worth anything to the Turk—in brief,.

H —_ the Turk thought that the Christian

ought to be pushed off the face of the
‘earth. Space will not allow full treat-
ment of the -terrible sufferings of -the
Christians through the dark_ ages up
to ‘the nineteenth century.

B The unbearable taxation, the fanati-
cism of the Turk and the inhuman

“treatment of i_ the Christiansﬁmade

them groan under the yoke of ‘the
Turk. They longed for freedom and
waited for the‘day to rise against the
Turk and ‘drive. him out of Europe.
During the‘ reign of Peter the
Great, efforts weremade by Russia-
to protect the ‘Christians in Turkey,
but Turkey’ was then powerful and
Russia could not do much in behalf
of the Christians.‘ The other great

‘ Europeans powers got more. or less

Amixedupl with Turkey for their own
-ben.eﬁt,—some for ‘trade, others for
territorial aggrandizement, etc. ,
Had not the great powers of Eu-
rope been jealous and blindedby

V selfish interests and material consid-

‘erations, they would not have forgot-
ten all laws,“human and divine; they
_would not have tolerated the sacrifice

p of.'Christian blood; they would not

have permitted the Turk to blot the

, most beautiful, the most. historical

sp.ot——the key to the world.

As it is, nations, calling themselves
-civilized, have permitted these atroci-
ties to go on, looking ealmly and
cooly, up’ to the twentieth century-.

Otempora! .Oimores! What ingrati-t

V tude to the nation which checked the
‘hordes of Asia and gave them time to
grow so great!

In 1821 the greatest event of the

‘nineteenth century ‘happened-——-as a
great French historian termed it4the
Greek Revolution. After an unpar-

, alleled‘ struggle of seven years against

the most blood-thirsty and infuriated

. ‘soldiery, a small part of Greece be-

came independent. The movement

' for liberty was condemned by the

—Holy Alliance, and Europe looked on

FIRSTJANNUAL RECEPTION
TO NEW STUDENTS

Successfully Held in Tree’s Gym-
nasium—S<_:ene of Much .En-
joyment.

 

The ﬁrst annual reception to the new
students. of the University was held

at. _Tree’s Gymnasium last Friday
evening’. The affair was a hug suc- '

éess in every possible way. Every
one was provided with" a card contain-
ing their name and department, thus,
all formalities were banis’hed_ and
every one knew every one else.
Chancellor S. B. McCormick and
wife headed’ the receiving line, con-
sisting of the majority of the mem-
bers of, the faculty. Registrar A. E.
Frost‘ was master of_‘cere'monies.
After calling the entertainment to
order Chancellor McCormick made a
speech,
greeting to the freshmen and other
new students, and emphasized the im-

portance of college education in fu— *

ture‘-life. _ _ A .
Mr. R. H. Wettach of the Student‘
Senate also made a very excellent ad-

dress, urging every student to take’.

part in some kind of collegegactivity.
The Chancellor said in criticism of
this speech ‘that it was the best ad-
dress he had‘ ever heard. ﬂ

The‘ remainder of the evening was
spent in having a social time. Re-
freshments were served, after which
the student orchestra played tuneful
melodies, while gaily dressed‘ co-eds
waltzedaround with gallant young
students. A ~ ‘

PITT HOLDS UNIQUE Y.

9
One of'th.e most interesting events
.on the Collegiate Field Card ten or

twelve years ago was the baseball
throwing contest. This has since been
abolished and Pittsburgh is credited
with ‘the Intercollegiate record.’

Pennsylvania held’ the record at 117
yards for a number of years, but in
one of the last contests of the kind
held Floyd Rose, of Pitt, threw a
regulation ball 124 yards, thereby
breaking the former record by seven
yards. The contestants threw from
left ﬁeld" to home plate and the meas-
uring was done from the throwing
line to the point where the ball struck
the ground, but Rose’s toss struck
the wall of thegrandstand several feet
above the. ground and the measure-
ment-pwas taken to the bottom of the‘.
wall, which cut him out of several
yards. Had the ball! traveled the f.ull
distance, he would probably. have
Eome near to eqiualing ‘the ‘profes-
sional record, which is about’ 134
yards and is held by Le’ Jeune.

COLLEGE HOLD.S MEETING

The College Department at its
weekly meeting in Thaw Hall stated
the year’s work in a most enthusiastic
meeting. Dean Fetterman gave half
of the morning to the singing of the
Alma Mater and patriotic songs. The
old tradition, that school spirit. is cen-
tered about the college department,
was emphatically proved. (One la-
mentable fact was in evidence: tliat
many upper classmen “ stood while
freshmen occupied -the seats. .Now,
remember, Willie, youn place is in one
corner after this.) I i

-"Dean Fetterman then gave 7, an in-
teresting talk on studgnt activities
and their ‘relation tr; college, work.
Mr. Lane of the English department

‘ was speaker. of the rnorning,pand told

of many amusing incidents.

Next week the meeting will be in
the hands of the faculty, and in the
following week will be in charge of
the students. I

WESTMINSTER, GAME
As is always the case when the foot-
ball team from McWatty Russell’s in-
stitution of learning comes to do

 battle vwith Pitt, the United Presby-
Saturday

terians in the game last
played just a littlebetter thanthey
generally play and the forces of Pitt
were off color to a great extent.

 ’.Westminster has ever given Pitt a
i g ’ .Ahard tussel, but the game last Satur-

day was the hardest that the New
Wilmington aggregation has ever
played on a,Pitt ﬁeld. From the
time that the ﬁrst whistle blew until
the last, play had been made every
man on their team played as if the

. A sole object of his existence was to

win from Pitt———or to come as near to
it" asiwas possible. A lighter team
tfhan"Pitt, they displayed all kinds of
grit and nerve, and on several occa-

sions threatened to crossthe goal line.
, by the tou-ch—down route.

And while

‘they failed to »score a touchdown,
they made as pretty a ﬁeld goal as
has beenseeii. on Forbes Field for
some time.

_ . » Our own men were away off in

Aform‘ and did not play the ball that
‘they are capable of ‘playing, and. the

kindof ball that they will play later '

in the season. The line was woefully
weak, and the whole team played a
‘decidedly, loose ‘game. _ Only the suc-

cessful working of the forward pass _

Abrought
ner

victory -to‘
was ‘the best.

Pitt. Wag-
performer for

. ‘t.h¢ 13‘1u‘e' and Gold, but even his work
~A‘was rather mediocre on several oc-h

t‘c_~as-ions’.'_é ‘  _ - . A
But-there-~is _no ‘need forany ofthe

E‘

'1

has, there will‘ be a marked improve-
ment in their play from now »on.
What do we ca_re about the score of
the Westminster struggle as long as
the games with W. & J. anAd.State are
victories for Pitt?’ Is it not better to
have all our poor. games early in the

season and then when the real con-

tests of the season come‘ around to
have the team ih the best possible
shape to play? '- This is'the time in

_the yearwhen a great amount of ex-

perimenting is being done in order to
ﬁnd out the weak places in the team
and have them strengthened for the
race ‘own the last lap of the season.‘
Have no ‘fear, before long “Foxy”
Joe Thompson will have the combina-
tion picked out that he wants for the
’Varsity, and when the time comes to
play our biggames there will be a
team on tl,A1‘eAﬁeld,',for Pitt that will
be hard to beat. i

versity continue to be of the caliber
of the man that addressed the gath-
ering on last Friday -morning,»there
will be no complaint from the student
body. It was not the ﬁrst time that
Dr. Callan had addressed the students
of .the University, and in all the times

that he has spoken at the assembly»

meetings’ he has never failed to give a
lecture that was well worth hearingA.
Dr. Callan possesses the power to
hold the attention of his audience to
the subject that he wishes to impress
on their minds. AHe says what he has
t0.say in a pleasing and forceful man-
ner, selcl_om exceeds the time that is
given him to speak, and invariably
presents something that is worth tak-
ing-Jhome and thinking over.
Chancellor McCormick has 'prom-
ised that the best speakers that are
available will be secured to make the
weekly addresses in chapel. This is
a. duty that those in charge of the ex-
ercises are bound to perform for the
student body of the University. Every

, student, unless he has a good excuse,

is supposed to ﬁbe at these weekly
convocations—-this ,is’ t‘he Astudentis
duty———and it is the duty therefore of
theUniversity to have the best men
that "areto be had make the ad-

dresses, for it is unreasonable to ex- ’ '
epect the students toattend the meet-

ings and listen to some speaker that
is worthless as a speaker, and who
creates a desire if) the hearts of the
students to cut. chapel just as often

as it is possible. A

lwEEI,i<Ly *  R .
i _PoL1T1es'.

It,i»s with a feeling of great joy that
‘we note the interest politics that

has been man.ifested'_in’ the Student
body during the last week. It shows
that the students of the University
are ‘awake and are taking a lively in-
terest in the affairs of the day. 4This
is the right spirit to display, and we
feel conﬁdent that there will be much
good derived from the meetings that
are to be held by the various political
clubs of Pitt from now until election
day. '

VVilson men and Roosevelt men are
hard at work getting their. forces
lined up for the campaign that is to
be waged.’ A meeting of the Roose-
velt_ men that was held on Thursday
of this week for the purpose Of or-
ganization was well- attended, and Ait
is expected that the meeting of the
Wilson men-to-d'aAy will bring out a
large number. After the clubs have
been well started it is the in_,tentiAon
of the leaders. of the organizations to
have many pro ent speakers of the
city. address “the meetings. It is to
be hoped that there will be no horse
play at the meetings this fall, such as

there was at the meetings that were’

attempted to be held just «before the
close of schoollast term. There is a
great amount of good to be gained
from these meetings, if they are con-
ducted on‘the._proper biasis.

So far nothing has been heard
-from the Taft. men, if there be any in
the University. It is time for the
“stand patters” to wake up if they in-
tend to make any showing in the
school campaign.

In describing the condition of the

United States at a certain period in’

its history, Dr. Holdsworth said the
other day: “It was just like a youth
at the period whenuhe is trying to
raise a mustache and can’t.” Then he
looked straight at a fellow that is
struggling to raise an overcoat for his
upper lip. R ‘ A i

We understand that the great
Thorpe went on a ﬁne little spree
after the  & J. game. You cannot
blame a man, though, for going on a
drunk after as hard a game as the
Indians played last week.~ -»

Just wait until John O’Conner,
Democrat, and Bernard Cooper, Pro-
gressive, get to throwing mud in the
political campaign that is to be waged
in the UniverAsity——-those times will be
real times. '

Q .
At ‘the weekly assembly on la

{Friday in Memorial hall a new item

was‘ added to the usual onder of

events. ’ Beginning to-day a period of.
‘ten ‘minutes will be devoted to the

practice of college songs. Between
the announcements and‘ before the
address ofjthe morning the students
will have complete charge of the

‘ meeting for songs. In inaugurating

this custom the Chancellor took oc-
casion to say‘ that t'he singing should

be of...a volume commensurate to a
'couple*hundred voices at least. Now

is our chance to make those songs
ring, .fellows, so that when the alma
mater is. started at ‘a game, there will
be no solos, but a thousand voices
singing for victory. ‘

Mr. Wagner was called by the stu-
dents to lead the singing last Friday
and" the music was stronger and more
enlivened than heretofore.

The ‘speaker of the morning was

 Callahan of Pittsburgh. Heis a
“ brdad mindedgman and speaks direct-

ly to the hearts of this hearers. His
subject was_: “The Gift of the Uni-
versity.” -

'Broido, Brady and Bane are eligible
to play, which gives the nucleus of a
goodteam. Among the new men are
Johnny Baker; Reese and Dillon. The
former "played "a star game at Pitts-

‘Penn Freshmen last season. He, is
eligible to play here, as he did not

son of‘t’he State Bureau of Profes-

Pittsburgh. The particular business
of this bureau isto pass upon the pre-

students in Pharmacy, Dentistry, and
Medicine, and to conduct examina-
tions three times a year for those
whocannot furnish evidence of hav-
ing done preparatory work in some

'the 'hope _ of establishing not only

higher_ but more uniforni ‘educational

~ standards. ,

This bureau is not provided for by
the new school code, 4but_the purpose
of the special law which authorizes it
is quite in keeping with thebroad pur-
poses of the recently enacted school
code; and it is expected that the ‘work
of the bureau will favorably affect
both the ‘higher and the lower phases
of our extensive educational system.

Surely those educators and profes-
sional men who are actuated by the

‘highly altruistic motive'of7 ﬁne social

service through their respective pro-
fessions will welcome the activities of
a bureau whose purpose is to make
sure that young men and women are
at least reasonably well prepared to
take up the study and practice of such
professions as have so much to do
with , human welfare. Professor
Johnson is easilyﬂapproadhed, and he
fwelcomes not only those who have
immediate business with his bureau,
but_ all school men and laymen who
may be interested. in the improvement
of educational conditions through
state agency. The oﬂice is open‘ on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in
the afternoons from one o’clock till
four, and on Saturday morning from
nine o’clock till twelve.
