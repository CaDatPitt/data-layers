Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett an-
nounced Wednesday that he will run
for re—election. A = B

Corbett, a native of Shaler Township,
returned to Pittsburgh to announce his
campaign at the Heinz History Center,
which is located Downtown. Corbett,
a Republican, has served as governor
since 2011 and based his candidacy for
a second term on claims that he has
fulﬁlled his promises to create more
jobs and reducetaxes.

While Corbett claims that he has cre-
ated morejobs, researchers at the Uni-
versity of Arizona have ranked Pennsyl-
vania 43rd in theicountry in job growth.
Jobs in the state grew .74 percent from
August 2012 to August 2013.

According to Billy Pitman, press sec-
retary for Corbett’s campaign, 141,000
new jobs have been created since Cor-
bett took office. The governor’s focus
area has been improving Harrisburg,
and if elected, he plans to “focus on
breaking down barriers to small busi-
ness, which affects job growth.”

said the current Allocations Manual is disor-
ganized and includes outdated policies. He
wants to revise the manual to ﬁgure out how
to fiind student organizations more efficiently.

N ites wants to establish a council of stu-
dents from Student—Affairs—afﬁ1iated groups
and outside of SGB to hold the Board ac-
countable and to provide input to the Board
on changes to the Allocations Manual and
other projects .

He said he would unite the Board by having

‘members work on projects together. Nites
said the members currently operate mainly A

as individuals to implement projects. He also
said that he would make SGB more transparent
by requiring the Board to vote on its budget at
a public meeting and that he wants the Board
members to publicly discuss decisions more
frequently, as opposed to making up their
minds before entering Board meetings.

Klein, ajunior studyingbusiness and ﬁlm,
is a sister of Theta Phi Alpha, the director of

dure for students outside of the Board to get
their ideas heard and to implement projects.

Klein has met with Commander Shawn
Ellies of the Pitt Police Department to dis-
cuss placing more of the Pitt Police’s blue light
emergency phones off campus and to ensure
that students who are leaving the library at
later hours due to its extended operatingﬁmes
will feel safe in the Oakland area.

To increase communication between stu-
dents and the Board, Klein said she wants
to have a central theme every month, such
as food, to which students would be able to
submit project ideas through social media
and other venues. The Board would choose
the most commonly submitted ideas or note-
worthy plans to implement on campus.

Benjamin, a junior studying linguistics, is

Judicial Board of the Interfraternity Council
and a teaching assistant in the linguistics de-
partment.

Benjamin said he will try to increase the
number of workout facilities on lower cam-
pus and- to streamline course registration so
students can search by general education re-
quirements and see syllabi while enrolling. He
said he also wants to install aﬁxture on campus
thatwould be painted by student organizations
and would serve bothas anadvertisingtool for
groups and to promote school spirit.

He has spoken to Kathy Humphrey, vice

provost and clean of students. Benjamin said

Humphrey wants to revamp campus workout
facilities, including putting a small workout

center on the third ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union. ‘

Affairs Committee to streamline the course
registration process. Benjamin wants to revise
Peoplesoft to improve the search process and
is contacting professors to discuss publishing
tentative schedules to courses so students will

CORBETT

Marc Eisenstein, spokesman for the
Pennsylvania Democratic Party, did not
respond to multiple requests for com-
ment.

The Center for Opinion‘ Research at
Franklin and Marshall College in Harris-
burg, Pa., conducted a survey in August
2013 on voters’ evaluation of Corbett’s
first term. The sample included 594 vot-
ers,‘ 292 Democrats, 217 Republicans and
85 people who identified themselves as

’ ‘independent or “other.”

The survey, which had a margin of er-
ror of plus or minus 4 percent, reported
that 62 percent of voters said that the
state is “off on the wrong track.”

Voters were skeptical of Corbett’s
performance in office.

Twenty percent of all voters —— and
38 percent of Republicans -— said that
Corbett deserved re-election.

According to the survey, respondents
also said that education and unemploy-
ment are the two most important issues
Pennsylvania faces.

While the voters who answered sur-
vey questions disapproved of the gov-
ernor’s performance, Pitman said that

Corbett has taken steps to increase the '

number of jobs in the state.

Pitman added that the numberof jobs
in natural gas drilling hasggrown during
Corbett’s administration.

“His main priority is job creation,
and he wants to make sure that jobs
are there for when [college students]
are graduating and having just a better
economy, in general, to come out to,”
Pitman said. I

fare recipients as leeches of the‘ system
who are unemployed or spending more
than they need. I always seem to doze
off when the rationalization from the
right begins with, “Give a man a ﬁsh,
and feed him for a day,” and ends by
miraculously transforming welfare cuts
into measures that help the poor in-

' "stead of hurting them. Readers, I give

you the mental acrobatics of the con-
servative right.

Welfare recipients can earn a maxi-
mum of $1,000 per month to qualify for
the program, meaning that the potential
for abuse — especially with restricted
programs such as food stamps — is
minimal. However, one common argu-
ment from the other side is that welfare
gives people an incentive not to work,
and in some ways, they’re right. In 39
U.S. states, welfare ‘pays more than an

more than a $12—per—hour job. And in
eight states, it pays more than the aver-
age salary of a U.S. teacher. Conserva-
tives interpret this as a sign that welfare
gives the poor too much money, but I
see it more as a sign that there is some-
thing wrong with our economic system
if workers can’t make living wages.
Beyond anecdotal evidence for abuse
of the welfare system, let’s take a look
at the facts. According to the Depart-
ment of Commerce, 4.1 percentof the
U.S. population uses the welfare sys-

tem, and the unemployment rate was
estimated at 7.3 percent in August of
this year. It doesn’t take a statistician
to see that even the unemployed aren’t
taking advantage of social government
programs. ‘

Perhaps if we stopped starting wars
for “humanitarian efforts” and started
actually putting some of that money
toward humanitarianism in our own
country, the;U.S. might not have the
fiscal burden it currently carries. I

Notre Dame travels to Heinz Field Saturday as Pitt A

seeks revenge for last year’s triple-overtime loss

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt’s last game against Notre Dame end-
ed in heartbreak, embodied by Kevin
Harper’s missed ﬁeld goal from 33 yards
out — a ﬁeld goal that would have given
Pitt an upset victory over the then—No.
3 Fighting Irish if it had gone through

’ the uprights.

One season later, the stakes are slight-

ly different for No. 23 Notre Dame. The‘

Irish will travel to HeinzAField this time
and will be without quarterback Everett
Golson, who was suspended for the sea-
son after he violated N otre Damefs honor
code by cheating on an exam.-

“You think about everything you do

in the past and use it, but I’m over that -

one,” head coach Paul Chryst said. “I
don’t know what the players think. A lot
of them didn’t play. This isthis year, and
we have to do a good job of making sure
they understand that.”

Quarterback Tom Savage, for one, is

looking forward to this game. Savage"

stood onlthe sidelines during last year’s
contest as a result of transfer rules.
“It’s going to be fun,” Savage said.

‘ “This is just like Florida State and that
game here. I’m pretty sure it’s sold out.

It’s every quarterback’s dream.”

The loss last year dropped the Pan-
thers under .500 after nine games, which
could-happen again if Pitt (4-4, 2-3 ACC)
falters at Heinz Field against Notre Dame
(7-2). '

“Last year was a completely different
year. Obviously, it was a close game,” Sav-
age said. “They have a great team coming

A back and so do we.” I -
Savage leads a Pitt offense that hasn’t ,

been as explosive as it was at the sea-
son’s onset, which was highlighted by a
58-point outburst against Duke. Since
their matchup with Duke, the Panthers
have scored no more than 35 points and
averaged just more than 17 points per
game.

Following the ‘matchup against Geor—, , -

gia Tech, Pitt faces a Notre Dame defense
allowing just 23 points per game.

“I think they’re just very disciplined,
[and] they don’t make too many mis-
takes,” Savage said. “We’Ve gotta ﬁnd
our ‘shots and take advantage of them.”

In the eyes of offensive coordinator
Joe Rudolph, the Fighting Irish build
their defense around a talented defen-
sive front.

“They have great size up front, [and]
they have great athleticism,” Rudolph

Pitt needs to establish the run to defeat Notre Dame. Bobby Mizia |Visua| Editor

said. “They do a little bit more defen-
sively, where they pressure you a little bit
more. They show you a few different looks
and even more than they did last year.”

Recruiting normally comes in season as
fall turns to winter. For example, Mike
Young signed his letter of intent in No-
vember 2012.

Now, before Pitt basketball’s 2013-2014
season has even officially begun, head
coachjamie Dixon already has talent lined
up for not just the class of 2014, but also
for 2015 and 2016.

In Dixon’s tenure, Pitt basketball hasn’t
recruited heavily around Pittsburgh be-
cause of a perceived lack of talent, but has
instead made New York and N ewjersey the
primary conduits. For the 2014 and 2015
classes, however, Dixon and his staff have
cashed in on both regions by recruiting
players from Pittsburgh and New York.

Pittsburgh natives Sheldon Jeter and
Ryan Luther have committed to Pitt for
2014, while Damon Wilson, a Georgia na-

. tive who’s attending school in New York,

‘Y

add local talent in next 3 years

has committed for 2015.

Jeter, originally from Beaver Falls, Pa.,
became the ﬁrst of the three to officially
commit, although he sought to attend
Pitt months before. Initially a member
of the 2012 recruiting class and ranked
as the 150th-best player in the country by
Rivals, Jeter didn’t receive a scholarship
offer from Pitt and instead committed to
Vanderbilt.

Jeter immediately contributed off the
bench as a true freshman for the Com-

modores and averaged 5.5 points on 47.1
percent shooting with 3.4 rebounds in 17.5
minutes per game.

Jeter wanted to play closer to home,
however, and hoped to transfer to Pitt fol-
lowing his ﬁrst season. Vanderbilt coach
Kevin Stallings had other plans, though,
and refused to releasejeter to Pitt for un-
disclosed reasons.

Strapped for viable options,_]eter’s fa-

Pitt men lookfor first Acc

Andrew Stern
Staff Wrz'ter '

The Pitt men’s soccer team heads into
tonight’s conference match with a bit
of conﬁdence fresh off a 9-0 victory
over Howard University. The conﬁdence
may be short-lived, however, as Pitt
heads to South Bend, Ind., to play No.
1 Notre Dame.
After losing 10 of their first 14
matches and failing to produce a single
' win over that stretch, the Panthers (1-
1o—4, 0-8-2 ACC) ﬁnally broke their
season—long slump Tuesday against
Howard. Pitt struck for nine goals and
tallied 38 shots on goal.
The nine-goal performance was the
best offensive showing in 20 years.

“The performance just proves one,’

what we’re capable of, but [also] the

  
 



 

strength of our schedule,” head coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “We’ve played so
many top teams, and now we finally
faced an average Division 1 team, and
we smoked them.”

Tuesday, the Panthers received goals
from six different players, including
a hat trick from senior striker ghris
Davis. ’

“It was great to finally get a goal,”
Davis said. “[The scoring] has been ab-
sent this season, but it is just about the
win, really. It’s nice to finally get a win.”

The win against Howard provided a
bit of a respite for the wary Panthers.
In addition to being the first win this
season, the match was the first time
the Panthers held a lead since a home
match against Boston College.

end Sheldon Day all contribute to a for-
midable defensive line. '

“Those guys up front make it happen,”
Rudolph said. “They can sit in their base
and play defense, those guys are good.”

Pitt’s own (defense, which has per-
formed well recently, will face a Fight-
ing Irish offense that’s scored 45 and 38
points in its last two games, respectively.

“When you watch them on tape, they’re
pretty good,” House said. “They’re deﬁ-
nitely a good offense, and it’ll be a good
challenge for us because it is back to
normal, similar to what you practiced in
training camp.”

In the backﬁeld, Notre, Dame quar— '
terback Tommy Rees presents a new
challenge to defensive coordinator Matt
House’s unit — one entirely different than
the one posed by Golson last season.

“I think Rees is playing really, really
good right now,” House said. “He’s throw-
ing-the ball really well.”

Rees has thrown for 2,186 yards and 22

‘ . touchdowns this season and poses more

of an aerial threat to the Pitt defense than
Golson, who relied on his dual—threat ca-
pabilities last season.

In last year’s contest, Golson racked up
301 yards of total offense, throwing for
two touchdowns and rushing for another.

“He can make all the throws,” House
said. “You watch him on tape and he’s
throwing nine routes to the ﬁeld. He’s
got the arm strength to do it.”

On the perimeter, the efforts of T.].
Jones and DaVaris Daniels complement
Rees’ passing ability. Jones leads Notre
Dame with 48 receptions for 742 yards
and seven touchdowns this season, and

each receiver gains an average of 15.5

yards per catch.

“They’ve got good wideouts, [and]
they can go up and make a play,” House
said. “He certainly takes advantage of
it, and I think he’s got great poise in the
pocket.”

Overall, Chryst says his team has put
last year out of mind and looks forward
to another opportunity to play.

“Our guys are looking forward to this
week,” Chryst said. “We’re playing a very
good Notre Dame team with a lot of good
athletes and football players.” I

RECRUITING

ther, Carliss Jeter, called his good friend
Matt Furjanic, who suggested that he en-
roll at Polk State College in Winter Haven,
Fla. Furjanic is the Polk State Eagles’ head
coach, and Jeter’s cousin Brock VanLier

plays for the junior college team, which

competes mainly against other two-year
schools in the Florida College System Ac-
tivities Association.

Jeter followed Furjanic’s advice.

On Sept. 28,]eter committed to Pitt at
the Panthers’ Morning Madness event. In
the meantime,]eter_ will practice with Polk
State and focus on academics, preserving
three years of eligibility when he arrives
at Pitt for the 2014-2015 season.

Furjanic describes the 6—foot-8Jeter as
a very good outside shooter, good athlete.
and a decent ball—handler. Dixon recruited
Jeter as a small forward, a position that
requires Jeter to handle the ball and cover
smaller players than him.

Furjanic saidjeter is working on each
of those aspects. .

“This year will give him a chance to
work on his game and work on'his body,”

. Furjanic said. “I think when Pitt gets him,

he’ll be a much better player than he was
at Vanderbilt.”

Although Jeter has made it a priority to
improve his own abilities, he’s also taken
on a leadership role at Polk State by keep-
ing practices intense and leading in the
weightroom.

“Sheldon has really become a leader
with us, explaining to the players what it
takes to get to the next level, because he’s
been there,” Furjanic said.

In addition to his contributions with
the team, Furjanic speaks just as highly
of]eter’s character.

“He’s just an outstanding kid,?’ Furjanic
said. “He’s personable. He’s good academi-
cally. He does everything you ask.”

Luther, a 6-foot—8 small forward from
Hampton High School in Allison Park,
Pa., is Pitt’s second commit for the 2014
class. Although Pitt was late to offer, Lu-
ther chose the Panthers over Duquesne,
Dayton and Iowa.

Rivals grades Luther as a three—star
recruit. As a junior at Hampton, Luther

_averaged 21 points per game. _

His size and varied skill set allows Lu-

ther the ﬂexibility to play both forward
spots. Hampton head coach Joe Lafko
spoke highly of Luther’s versatility in a
story by the Pittsburgh Tribune—Review.

“Ryan is a versatile player,” Lafko said.
“He has the ability to play in the interior
and also has the ability to stretch a defense
by shooting from the perimeter.”

Although they’re not ﬁnished with the
2014 class, the Panthers secured their
most recent commit for 2015 in Wilson,
a 6:foot—4 point guard and four—star recruit
according to Rivals. Wilson chose Pitt over
Alabama, Florida, Florida State, Georgia,
Georgia Tech, Miami, Stanford, Virginia
and Virginia Tech.

A Originally from Powder Springs, Ga.,
Wilson decided to transfer to Our Sav-
ior New American School in Centereach,
N.Y., for his junior and senior years of high
school. '

Assistant coach Brandin Knight was
Wilson’s lead recruiter, and the two es-
tablished a relationship that became a key
factor in Wilson choosing Pitt, according
to Our Savior assistant coach Ericjaklitsch.

“It was a combination of playing in the
ACC, playing for a winning coach likejamie

Dixon, playing with a friend of his in‘ [Pitt A

freshman] Mike Youngand playing with a
kid that was all rookie last year in James
Robinson,”Jaklitsch said. “And he’s going
to be under the tutelage of a former Big
East Player of the Year in Brandin Knigh .”
Jaklitsch believes Wilson could grow to
6-foot-6 by the time he arrives at Pitt, an
abnormal height for a point guard. Com-
bine that height with his left—handedness
and Wilson might become a mismatch
nightmare for opponents. ‘
Jaklitsch believes thispotential will
make Wilson an excellent college player.
“He’s a great facilitator, can get to the
basket, he’s a good defender and he’s got
a very strong will to win,”Jaklitsch said.
Wilson’s commitment should only help
in Pitt’spursuit of his teammate, 6~foot-9
power forward Cheick Diallo, who is a fel-
low member of the class of 2015, a ﬁve—star

prospect and Rivals’ No. 8—ranked recruit.‘

Next to these players, Pitt also has
Maverick Rowan out of Lincoln Park High
School in Midland, Pa., inbound as a mem-

ber of the class of 2016. Rowan is already a

four-star recruit, according to Rivals, and
the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic Leagues’s top—ranked underclass
player. I

“At the end of the day, though, we
have not gotten the results we wanted,
but coming into Notre Dame the guys
feel good,” Luxbacher said.

The Panthers currently sit in last
place in the conference, a fate that
means the team will not qualify for next

weekend’s ACC postseason tournament.
On the ﬂip side, Notre Dame (10-1-

5, 6-1-3 ACC) enters the match leading
the ACC standings. Like Pitt, the Fight-
ing Irish are in their first season as a
member of the conference.

Notre Dame’s only loss came on Oct.
26 against current No. 15—ranked Vir-
ginia.

“[Notre Dame] is the No. 1~team, and
they’ve only lost once in the ACC, so it
is going to be an extremely tough test,”
Luxbacher said. “But [our performance
against Howard] shows that we’re ca-
pable of playing pretty well.”

The Fighting Irish currently have
one of the most dangerous players in
the nation in captain Harrison Shipp.

This season, Shipp has produced 21
points (7 goals, 7 assists), which is cur-
rently good for second place in the con-
ference. Shipp also is tied for the ACC
lead in game-winning goals with four.

In net, the Irish pose a threat in the

form of starting keeper Patrick Wa1l,.

whose play in—goal mirrors the meaning
of his surname. .
Through the first 16 games of the

season, Wall has produced a goals-
against average of 0.64 and compiled
51 saves, while producing the second
most (6) shutouts in the ACC.

After the match on Friday, the Irish
will advance to next week’s ACC Tourna-
ment, while the Panthers’ season will
be finished.

“Going into the [last] match of the
season,’ and the last [match of my ca-
reer], we are definitely going to give
it one more shot,” Pitt senior captain
John Cordier said. §
