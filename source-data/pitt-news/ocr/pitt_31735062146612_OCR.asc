« P Secret Committees
1 Each year at this time not less

“than ﬁve nor more than seven

iwomen ‘are chosen by a secret

_, of an unknown number of indi-
 viduals, which meets clandestine-

,1.y.."I‘his nominating committee, in
turn, is appointed by an anonymous
individual or group of individuals.
, . In selecting the outstanding
iwomen of the senior class, the
committee looks for girls who are
‘symbolic of Pitt womanhood.
9; The Coronation ritual, a part of
the tradition of the University,

_.states: “In choosing one girl to
‘ receive the official crown, mem-

‘bers of the class not only honor

‘ her as a person, but also see in her
. and honor in her her their own
, personalities. They pay tribute to

“ideal of what a w-oman graduate
‘ofthe University should be.”

X " ‘Qualiﬁcations for Selection

 {Although high scholarship is

ilconsideredg in selecting the nom-

sjinees, it is.not- requisite, and there
jyis no set low of quality point aver-
‘fage below which a considered
‘ nominee becomes" ineligible. Activ-

; ities, also, are not important.

 ,, “It is not the key position which
Faegirl occupies, nor the number of
activities in which she takes an
V active interest,” says Miss Helen
,Poo1 _Rush, dean of women. “We
"select girls on‘ the basis of how
g unselﬁshly the’y- have given of
their time and effort to the Uni-
versity.” '

Graduate Record examina-
tion will be given to advanced
sophomores on the afternoons
of April 3 and 4 and to cer-
tain other students on April 7
and 14.’ Interested faculty
members may take the exam-
ination free of charge at the
regularly scheduled times under
a plan which preserves their
complete anonymity. They
must, however, agree to take a
complete set of examinations,
which requires two sessions of
four hours each. The under-
signed will be glad tosupply a

terested and to answer any

Sing Date Changed 1

To Avoid Conflict

Date for Inter-class Sing, spon-
sored by Women’s Self-Govern-
ment association, has been changed
so that it will not interfere with
an examination of sophomores
scheduled by the School of Edu-
cation for admission to that school.

The sing will take place on

Monday, March 19, instead of
Wednesday, March 14, in the YM
and YWHA auditorium, from 1 to
2:30 o’clock. ' ‘

General theme of the traditional
affair this year will be “Spring.”
The decision of the judges will be
based on: attendance, 25 per cent;
originality, 25 per cent; singing, 25
per cent; appearance, 15 per cent;
enthusiasm, 15 per cent.

Women students will be author-
ized to be absent from sixth hour
classes on Monday, March 19, but
they may not be absent the sixth
hour on Wednesday, March 14.

Twelfth Floor Plans Changed;
Dollars Donated at Affairs

TO ALL THE 'WOMEN OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTS-
BURGH.

There can be no understate-
ment of the power of the coed of
Pitt. There can be" no greater af-
ﬁrmation that the Women’s Self
Governing association represents
the wish and will of the Pitt
Woman than the revisal of the lat-
est WSGA -project.

To celebrate the ﬁftieth anni-
versary of the co-education pro-
gram at this University, WSGA
has initiated, and promoted a cam-
paign to raise a sum of money to
be presented in the name of Pitt
women at next year’s ceremony.
The amount desired was $100,000
—to be a-chieved by the individual
eﬁorts of 1,100 coeds by the end
of March.

The beginning slump of the

  

won-dered about Pitt Sp‘: it and
backing. To get to, the bottom of
the difficulty, they held. meetings
in the rooms of the Cathedral, lis-
tening to girls speak frankly con-
cerning the project, and ultimate-
ly revamped the program at a
commission meeting last Thurs-
day.

“The girls who had spoken to
Helen Hadgis, Ed, head of the
Governing Association, and to the
other rnembers, said they felt the
average coed did nothave the con-
tacts to raise $100. They further
stated that it was neither unwill-
ingness to cooperate  the ven-

representatives. that prevented
their backing. ‘

“We really want a 12th ﬂoor.”

“Would you ﬁnd another way
for us to raise the money-?” ,WSGA
members asked.

The coeds would. Because it was
asked by -the women“ whom they
sincerely represent, WSGA elim-
inated the March deadline and
presented another ide‘a‘—ﬁrst to
the girls present and then to the
commission.

The raising of the ﬁftieth anni-
versary fund will be done as a
group movement by the 1,100 co-
eds. Plans are in process now by
which dollars will be donated at
“Pitt Women Affairs.” The affairs
will be spread out over a large
margin of time, and students will
work as a group, as well as in-

mdividually. Progress has already

been made in this direction by
the freshman class,‘ who are in
the rhidst of promoting skits and
various other “fund-fi,nd“,ers.” Pan-
hellenic and Mortar Board intend
sponsoring a bridge in the near
future. Pitt Players organization
has donated a portion ofthe pro-
ceeds from “Hedda Gabler” in the
interest of the campaign, and
other groups have entered into the
trend with equal zest. {More than
$3,000 had been turned in by
Friday, March 9, through the co-
operation of individuals who had
succeeded in collecting'* the money
from their outside contacts. When

Trips to Seton Hill, Bowling
and Pennsylvania State
colleges hav-e ‘beenplanned this
week by Men’s Debating associa-
tion as the major part of its.pro-
gram for March. '

Four rounds of -debating on the
1944-45 college debate question

resent Pitt will be Harvey Sal-
kovitz, C, an-d Dick Hazley, C,

in Ohio on March 24. Five rounds
of debating, ﬁve rounds, of ex-
tempore speaking and two rounds.-

do with Germany after the War?”
The speakers are Dick Hazley, C,
and Leonard Walk, C, aﬂirlmat-ive;
and John Wagner, C, and Jack
Gilbert, C, the negative:

Because of the ODT prohibition

March 22-24 allow Men’s Debat-
ing association only three repre-
sentatives. These will be Gerald
Stern, C, Victor Stein, C, and

dent congress announces the ac-
ceptance of applications for posi-
tions on spring festival planning
committee. Petitions may be ob-
tained in the oﬂ‘i.ces of the dean

Rowbottom Resigns

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, has announced that Lois
Rowbottom, former editor of the
Pitt News, has resigned her posi-
tion as secretary to the Dean, ef-
fective on March 24. Miss Row-
bottom plans to assume a writing
and advertising job with the Hos-
pital Service association at that

   
 
  

‘Pitt last year.

The goal here at Pitt is a con-
tribution from ‘everybody. No
minimum has been set, but the
students are urged to give as much
as they possibly can. Friday, ‘those

persons who are not wearing the

white tags with the Red-Cross in-
signia, will again be solicited by
committee members stationed in
the booth on the ground ﬂoor. Not
only are individuals being asked
for contributions, but also all or-
ganizations and fraternities on
campus. . —~

Co—chairman Burwinkel says,
“Everyone knows what wonderful
work the Red Cross is doing, and
I think our students should con-
sider it a privilege to do every-
thing they can to make our drive
a success.”

Miss Helen Pool Rush, dean of
women, announced today, “The
cause of the Red Cross is so Well
known that little more must be
said for it. Every student should
feel the obligation to give freely,
and I hope every student does give
as freely as he possibly can from
his own money.”

Officially opening the Red Cross
War Fund drive on Tuesday,
March 13, Mrs. Peggy Usher, back
from eighteen months service in
England, addressed the student
speakers and others interested at
a meeting in Room 132. Mrs.
Usher is an International Red
Cross worker.

To continue its wartime work
during the next twelve months the
Red Cross needs $200,000,000.
Last year thousands of dollars
were contributed to the Red Cross
by American college and univer-
sity students.

Gallery Exhibit

Paintings

An exhibit of Chinese paintings
organized by the fine arts depart-
ment is now on display in the sev-
enth ﬂoor gallery.“

Many of the examples reveal
the aesthetic richness attained
during the Sung and Yuan periods.
Also represented are scenes char-
acteristic -of the Ming and Tang
times which were nearly equal in
artistic achievement to the above-
named dynasties. Each of these
ages had their own distinguishing
features in art, such as the pre-
dominance of emotion, spontaneity,
and humor during the late Sung
era and the romantic quality of
the Yuan time. I The Ming period
was characterized by a decorative
style and the portrayal of genre
themes. Buddhist subjects were
popular especially during the lat-
ter part of the Tang age.
the most decisive factors in the

consideration of Chinese art is the

profound effect of imperial patron-
age upon its growth through many
centuries. Under the fostering
and encouraging inﬂuence of the
emperors, China became one of
the principal cultural centers of
the world.

It has been announced that
the dance, scheduled by the
Engineers for April 7, has been
changed to April 13.‘ The
dance will be held. in the Wil-

There ’s a subversive ‘movement afoot. 'It’s not very strong,
as yet, but echoes a similar attempt made last year. Already,
therelhave been a number of discussions about this particular
situation.

The powers-that-be and a handful of agreeable students are
appalled by the “chaotic” situation of the two cafeterias. In
Commission, less than a month ago, the Tuck Shop problem came
up for discussion. The concensus of opinion, that is of those
few who contributed to the discussion, seemed to be that: ‘the
Tuck Shops are overcrowded and noisy—crowded by people
who shouldn’t be there, for they aren’t eating and are keeping
paying customers from sitting down (Where else is a large stu-
dent body to go? Out onethe s:treets?), books and articlesof
clothing litter the tables (But lockers area scarcityl); cigar-
ette smoke is so dense that--one can scarcely breathe (Try to ﬁnd
a solution to that one!) ; there is gambling in the corners (Bridge,

" with no money involved, seems innocent enough); students are

ill-mannered and rude (Which, after all,_is a relative accusa-
tion) ; there is necking in broad electric light (This I and most
of us have never seen, but they insist they can cite examples.)
In addition to all this, the students are very cliquish and un-
friendly to strangers. , ' i . -
i We have expounded on this “clique” business before, ‘so
I’ll say no more than this: there are numerous teas and social
events designed to acquaint the new student; classes facilitate
getting introductions; other than that, time alone creates friend-
ships.‘ Pittsburgh has “always been considered a friendly city,
and its children are not odd in this respect. Pitt students are
‘not unique in reserving judgment of new acquaintances.
Commission hadn’t time that evening to discuss the prob-
lem fully, for it was brought up in connection with another
subject for discussion. But they did suggest that the answer
might be to have student hostesses directing Itrafﬁc in the Tuck
Shops. And there was unanimous agreement, that is among

those who managed to get their two,-cents-worth in, that the
‘general atmosphere of the Tuck Shops should be more digniﬁed.

They cited the Commons room» as an example, and posed the
question, “VVhat would visitors and outsiders think of our Uni-

, versity if they happened to drop in for a spot of coke in either

the ‘Blue or Red Shambles’°.?”
I First of all, the question. A Visitors, and especially visitors

A who have attended or seen other college campuses would cer-

tainly not be so appalled at conditions as a percentage of Com-
mission is. Every campus has its Student Union where the stu-
dentbody can go on their free time to relax and smoke, read.a
magazine or join in a bridge game or work off a little steam_1n
dancing. And anybody who knows anything about college life
expects that there to be a place comparable to a.Union on
every campus. Dr. Bowman and Dr. Fitzgerald know it; in their
plans for the University, there is a Student Union to be in-
cluded among the new dorms and labs to be constructed.

The Commons room is a ﬁne andlbeautiful place, and stu-
dents are often in the mood to go there just to sit quietly and

‘listen to the organ. Just the same as they like to slip into Heinz.

chapel in ‘the, afternoon merely to sit and think or let their minds
wander and watch the long sun rays come through the red and

1 blue and green of the windows- But people don ’t exist forever
in an atmosphere like that.

And for most people, the percent-
age of time that they like to spend in meditation is far less than
that other portion in which they crave company and entertain-
ment.

However, all of these points cloud the real issue. Until
the school supplies another place where students can relax, I
say they can’t justly nor successfully deprive us of the Tuck
Shops. There is nothing outrageous going on there that would
shock :the sensitive soul in an onlooker. The only answer, of

‘ course, is an honest to goodness Student Union.

, In the) meantime, watch out for this subversive movement.

Just a few months back, there
was an editorial in The Pitt News
concerning fraternity hazing. Now
that rushing is over and another
hazing period is coming again,
thesubjlect- could be given an-

other going over-—.but not in the
same s-ense as was written before:
The article on Hell Week in one!

of our past issues was deﬁnitely
for hazing. Well, ‘this one is tak-
ing the other point of view. C
One of the mos‘. pathetic and
unnecessary -sights during and af-
ter the usual Hell Weeks around
Pitt is -the “beat” look of the new
actives. They wsnde—r around the
halls with the ‘most dog-faced ex-
pression any one ‘ever saw on a
college boy. When you ask them

their trouble, they tell you they

haven’t had any sleep for three
nights, had to hike back into town
after being deposited thirty miles
‘away, had to do ‘this, had to do
that. Some of the things they
were forced to do aren’t even
printable. ‘

Just ‘What’s the idea, boys?

of not letting a pledge get a rea-
sonable amount df sleep anyway?
Professors will tell you more men
fall asl—eep in their -classes, during
and iafterl Hell Week than any
other time of the year. There’s
nothing like it.

~ Granted, a few fraternities have
had the insight and intelligence
to go easy’ with their men, and
much is to be said to their credit.
But a lot mor-e should follow suit.
Be more lenient with the future
actives, won’t you? Give the fel-
las a break. Your fraternity won’t
collapse because of it.

SOPHOMORES AN GRADS TO
TAKE ACHIEVEMENT TESTS

Graduate Record examination,
achievement test in academic sub-
jects, will again be given at the
University in early April. Dates
set for the quizzing are the after-
noons of April 3 and 4, at which
time advanced sophomores will be
examined. Another group consist-
ing principally of graduate stu-
dents planning to do advanced
work in chemistry will take the
tests on the afternoons of April 7
and 14.

FOURTH GROUP OF PITT
SOPHOMORES TO BE TESTED
ON G. R. E. PLAN

The above sessions will mark
the fourth consecutive semester
in which this series of examina-
tions will have been available 10-
cally. The University is one of
more than 70- institutions of high-
er learning making use of this
highly scientiﬁc instrument to
assess academic progress by invit-
ing or requiring certain students
to take the Graduate Record ex-
amination. Pitt’s endorsement and
participation in the project fol-
lowed soon after" its initiation un-
der the auspices of the Carnegie
foundation and an original spon-
soring group of leading universi-
ties. Originally designed to help
prospective graduate students to
assess the thoroughness of their
preparation for advanced studies
and independent research, the
tests: are now being given also
at the sophomore level to help
students determine more intelli-
gently the direction which their
training in the upper division of
the college should take. By show-
ing up relative strengths or weak-
nesses in several basic ﬁelds of
knowledge the student may dis-
cover the ﬁelds. in which prepara-
tion is adequate as cor'npared with
other students, and those in which
it would be advisable to do fur-
ther work in order to prepare for
a particular specialty, or to get a
well—rounded liberal education.

doesn’t like examinations. He feels
that they “put him -on the spot,”
that their purpose is to give him
as low a grade as the law will al-
low. Yet most people, including
the genus under discussion, seem
to enjoy all kinds o-f tests when
they know that their knowledge
is not being graded. Quiz pro-
grams are popular with young and
old, as are the many tests pub-
lished in newspapers and maga-
zines. The so-called “personal-
ity” test, too, is popular.

The difference is that the latter
quizzes and tests are taken in the
spirit of a game, or for the pur-
pose of ﬁnding out “how good you
are.” The Graduate Record ex-
amination is different in this same
sense. It is not given for the pur-
pose of grading the student, or of
showing up his ignorance. Rath-
er it is given to help him by

unite, the present attainment will
expand more rapidly and in great-
er leaps than at the beginning of
the project.

In presenting the idea of group
action, WS-GA is hoping to achieve
two important goals: the ﬁnal ac-
complishing of the amount desir-
ed, and the unifying of the coeds
through group participation. The
members feel that any lack of
Pitt spirit and enthusiasm will be
dispensed with when the girls
work on a mass project.

If there is any vagueness con-
cerning the future plans of the
WSGA for the twelfth ﬂoor, if the
facts have not been presented
clearly enough, it is advisable to
see Helen Hadgis or Lucille Mor-
gan, C. They will be willing to
help in any way. Any suggestions
whatsoever to insure the success
of the undertaking should be ‘given
to someone in authority.

plishments are at a certain date.

A MEASURE OF GENERAL
EDUCATION IN EIGHT FIELDS
WITH ADVANCED TEST
IN MAJOR SUBJECT

The Graduate Record examina-
tion gives. an inventory of “what
you know, regardless of Where

and how you learned it,” in each ‘

of eight basic subject ﬁelds and,
by means of an advanced test, in
the subject in which you are ma-
joring. The tests are given in two
sessions lasting four hours each.
Thus they are unquestionably ex-
hausting as well as exhaustive,
but the price of two afternoons of
hard work is well worth paying
for the beneﬁts tobe derived in
increased self-knowledge.

A COMPETENT SERVICE AT
UNIVERSITY EXPENSE
Advanced sophomores and cer-
tain graduate students ‘are requir-
ed to take the Graduate Record
examination at the expense of the
University. They are being reg-
istered for the examination
through the College oﬁice and in
certain English classes. Juniors,
seniors, and special students who
are not authorized to take the ex-
aminations at the University’s«ex-
pense may do so on their own
initiative for a fee of $1.50. Ar-
rangements may be made through
Mrs. Gertrude Ku.mmer in the
College office on the eighteenth
floor of the Cathedral. Dr. Alfred
G. Dietze of the department of
psychology is examiner in charge.
A descriptive brochure giving full
information about the nature of
the test and beneﬁts to be derived
from it may be obtained from
either Mrs. Kummer or Dr. Dietze.
Students who wish to avail them-
selves of this opportunity should

Spickness and spanness were de rigueur in the col-
leges of the 1840s. This portrait depicts a member
of the Class of 1845 attired for the Junior Prom.
Observe the height of his stock and the costly ruﬂies

on his shirt.

In that same year, 1845, the Mexican War was im-
minent. Railway Express service was 6 years old.
The colleges were few. Now, a century later, Amer-
ica is ﬁghting a global war, the colleges are counted
by thousands, and our service is nation-wide.

Today, the colleges are training students for the
armed services; and the rail and air facilities of
Railway Express are being largely utilized for the
speeding of war~goods shipments. So, to help all
concerned, please do three simple things with your

curely—address clearly and adequately—avoid ab-

breviatiug state names.

over, they know all money then

and will not be cashed until after
the war. Who knows whether
those dollars would have ever
reached war bonds if it hadn’t
been for Pitt Women?

War Finance

Sets Schedule

The War Finance committee,
continuing its program of bond
and stamp sales sponsored by ac-
tivities organizations, wishes to
announce that three new dates
have been scheduled. Next week,
March 21, Cwens, the, sophomore
women’s honorary, will have
charge of the ground floor booth,
and on April 4 and 11 the YMCA
and YWCA respectively will take
over. Dates for Druids, Mortar
Board, ODK, and other campus
organizations will be announced
soon in the Pitt News.

In urging students to support

Jacqueline Goodman, Ed, chair-
man of the committee, emphasizes.
the importance of small regular
purchases of stamps. Few stu-
dents can buy bonds very often,
but 25 cents every week from a
million college students is enough
to pay for ﬁve P-47’s a week.

Basketball Research and Fatigue.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, -director of student health service for men, after
ten years of research, sponsored by the National Association of Bas-
ketball Coaches, has published his ﬁndings on whether competitive
sports, such as basketfball, are harmful to the youth of today.

After the research was com-9

pleted, the information compiled
and the graphs made, Dr. Carlson
wrote a «book on his ﬁn-dings. The
proof is that there is nothing bet-
ter than compet-itsive athletics to
develop a sound body.

The methods used in the re-
search were developed at Pitt and
were conﬁrmed in m-any nearby
junior and senior high schools.
Later they were utilized by uni-
versity and college basketball
teams to set up this Work. The
Aircrew students at Pitt offered

-in their conditioning program a

rare opportunity for nearly per-
fect controls. Other groups which
contributed greatly in the doc-
tor’s research were the Pitt engi-
neers, AST Reservists and 296
athletes in 39 colleges all over
the United States.

The following is what was prov-
ed. When a person is in good con-
dition, i-t will cost him less en-
ergy to do more; after completion
of his work when he is in a state
of fatigue, he will recover in two
minutes, much more quickly than

the individual in poor physical

condition.
Dr. Carlson bases his results on

I 2~O;O~0~04 subjects who ran through

such tests as leg muscles, spot
running, exercising, and basket-

. wball play. Each “guinea pig” had
'tests run over a period of time

and ‘the pulse rate was recorded.
In makin-g out .the charts to deter-
mine the ﬁndings, two things were
kept in mind: (1) Effort put forth
and (2) cost in heart ‘beat. The
ﬁrst count was taken immediately

‘after exercise then at intermit-

tent periods until the normal heart
rate is reached.

Summing it -all up, Dr. Carlson
has proved that “Strenuous com-
petit-ive athletics is the best way
to develop health, and structural
and functional development of
American youth.”

School Makes Awards

The faculty of the School of
Law has made awards from the

James B. Eisaman Fund to Vin-'

cent L. Swegzda and John M.
O’Laughlin. Swegzda, Pitt, A. B.,
’44, and O’Laughlin, Allegheny,
A. B., ’43, were elected by the
faculty to share in the income

from the fund which was estab-

lished by the late Lillian Eisaman
in memory of her husband. The
awards, which are given annually,
are used to help with tuition and
other Law school expenses.

Irish Celebrate
The Wearing
Of The Green

Did you ever stop to w.onder
why we celebrate Saint Patrick’s
day? Or why we wear a sham-
rock on Saint Patrick’s day?

We celebrate March 17, Saint
Patrick’s day, because it was St.
Patrick who Christianized Ireland.
In A. D. 423, he received his
mission from Pope Saint Celestine,
and he was sent as Bishop to Ire-
land. In Ireland, Pat-rick devoted
himself to his work of convert-
ing heathens, establishing bish-
oprics, holding councils, organiz-
ing Christian -societies which he
found in existence on his arrival,
organizing the church of the coun-
try, and planting the faith in re-
gions which had not come under
the sway of the gospel. In urging
the reform of Irish law, he con-
demned the enslavement of Chris-
tians. Tradition says that Patrick
found “Ireland all heathen and
left it all Christian.” '

His intense spiritual nature and
enthusiasm enabled him to sur-
mount difﬁculties and become the
ﬁrst missionary whose labors were
crowned with any considerable
success. For his work in bringing
the Faith to Ireland, Patrick was
canonized a Saint by the Catholic
Church.

Of all the legends about Saint
Patrick, probably the most fam-
ous is the one about Saint Patrick
and the serpent. Tradition has it
that Saint Patrick cleared Ireland
of its .snakes with the exception of
one. Saint Patrick made a box
and invited the serpent to enter.
The serpent after protests that the
box was too small entered to
prove its case. Saint Patrick closed

the lid and threw the box‘ into the
sea, Legend says the waves of the
sea are made by the writhing of

the serpent and the noise of the
sea is that of the serpent implor-
ing the saint to release it.

Saint Patrick chose the sham-
rock for his emblem because the
three leaves symbolize the Trinity.

Journalism Class Visits
The Pittsburgh Courier

Pitt’s journalism class, directed
by Miss Emily G. I-rvine, toured
the offices of The Pittsburgh Cour-
ier, the _largest negro newspaper
in the country, last Thursday
afternoon as part of a program.
during the course, of visits to
newspapers.

The group was taken through

the composing room, the press
room, the art department, the
business . department, and it saw
linotype machines in operation,
the make-up department, and the
engraving room where they were
photographed.
Mrs. Sadie P. Herron, a member
of the class and also an employee
of the Courier, made the arrange-
ments for the visit.

Rev. Gordon S. Huffman, chap-
lain to the Lutheran students on
campus, will speak at the next
chapel service to be held Friday,
from 1 to 1:30 o’clock. He will
deliver a talk entitled “Some-
where Over the Rainbow.” ,

This special Lenten program is
sponsored by the Lutheran Stu-
dents’ association which has reg-
ular monthly discussion meetings
at the University. Their advisor,
Rev. Huffman, who is pastor of
the St. John’s Lutheran Church in
Mars, Pa. is available for student
consultation every Tuesday after-
noon in the Cathedral. He re-
ceived his bachelor of arts degree
from Lenoir—Rhyne College in
North Carolina and attended Theo-
logical Seminary at Capital Uni-
versity in Columbus, Ohio. Rev.
Huffman was formerly assistant
pastor of youth work at St. John’s
Lutheran church in Akron, Ohio.

It’s been said in the past that “A
word to the wise is sufﬁcient."
Well, Wise Guys, here’s your
word! Your frequent little gems
of wisdom, ingenious. as they may
be, are seldom appreciated by the
lecturer. Oh, an occasional ﬂight
of humor is a good thing, but the
habitual use of it is frowned on,
by all means.

And you lovely co-eds . . .
(you are lovely!) . . . don’t mis-

‘take the Norwegian room for a

powder room, and that black piece
of furniture in the Chinese room is
not a dressing table; This infor-
mation comes via a number of dis-
tracted instructors.

Sleeping in class is not solicited
by your teachers, either, especially
if it is the noisy variety. "There
are a few isolated cases where the
professor doesn’t care whether- his
students sleep or not, but no names
will be divulged.

The philosophy that chewing-
gum is scarce; chew it when you
can, holds no water where Pitt’s
faculty is concerned. Even mak-
ing a concession, most of them will
agree that “It’s not what you do,
it’s the way that you do it” that
counts. If you are inclined to use
that Borden’s cow approach, your
best bet would be to eliminate the
negative and keep the gum under
the thumb.

By Ursula Halloran

We’re in sort of a morbid moo-d
this -week. It’s all because of a
poll that was taken by the News.
It seems that of all the columns in
the paper we ﬁnd ours is the least
popular, although seemingly the
most read. Ahem——sort of a West-
brook Pegler situation———on a
slightly smaller scale, of course.

What a week for news! What
a ‘week for news! And none of it
printable, as usual . .

‘Saturday night was Uncle Joe
(This curfew’s the only thing I
haven’t been able to beat) Mazer’s
night, and Chuck Tremont (Bill
Humes has bequeathed his “Hot
Copy” title to Fausto) started off
the evening with a semi-civilized
dance in somebody’s nightgown in
front of Bill’s Hamburger Joint on
Craig Street.

.During the course of the even-
ing we noticed a lot of former Pitt
men home on furlough and helping
to cut the smoke that pervades
the atmosphere. Among them
were Len Matonak, George “Juicy”
Hawker, both former PiKA’s, and
Phi Gam\Jack Davis. Also pres-
ent was Jack 0’Toole. (We don’t
know who he is or what fraternity
he belongs to, but he looked in-
teresting.)

This item sounds like it came
from the sports department.‘
Strange, isn’t it? In spring train-
ing Nate Prashker made a triple
play. The Phi Ep pin went from
Flagg to Prashker, and back to
Fla-gg. Credit an assist to Norm
Weissman.

New freshman Mary Lou Wilson
had a‘ big week-end. Friday night
with Vinnie Stuift, and Saturday
night with Dick Matson. She’s
Pitt’s gift from Brookville, popula-
tion ﬁve thousand.

News from TPA has it that Ruth
Fallon will be married by April 15,
at 'the latest. Ah, me, one more
good woman leaving.

Anne Whitlinger’s problem dur-
ing the coming week will be what
to do about former RCAF pilot,
Jack Barry, now a Pitt student,
Howdy Masquelier, an old Phi
Gam, who will hit town for a fur-
lough soon.

Bob (Has anyone seen my kitty
—car) Buell is looking for Jim
Johns, who had a little accident
with a street car while driving
Buell’s car. Bob told _us that while
Johns is footing the bill for a
smashed fender, he may as well
have the brakes relined at the
same time. To save money,
though, he’s having the pledges
re-paint the car with a nice thick
coat of Kem-tone.

See Ed Wagner, June Thomson,
and Ed Deichman for directions
to a new nightspot that’s supposed
to be really hep. The name is
Jackson’s Tea Garden. Solly, no
tea!

This week the pledges of men’s
fraternities are getting acquainted
with the new women pledges,
which should have some interest-
ing results for next week.

In the meantime, may we re-
mind you of the E & M Cabinet
dance on April 13. More informa-
tion later.

Former Editor
Writes in Post

Technical Sergeant Milton Leh-

Pitt News, tells the story of the
front line infan-trymen in an ar-
ticle, “Nothing Ahead But Krauts,”,
published in the March 10 issue of
the Saturday Evening Post.

Sgt. Lehman, correspondent for
the army newspaper Stars and
Stripes, interviewed men who be-

have been through it.” These men,
veterans of Anzio now ﬁghting in

the physical exhaustion, an-d quiet
heroismof life in the front lines.

A 1939 graduate of the College,

What is the first thing you're going to do when the war’s over?

This is definitely a _sixty-four dollar question, and most Pitt stu-
dents prefer taking it instead of leaving it. . . -.

‘According to the results of a Tuck shop booth-to-booth survey,% it
students’ post-war plans cover a wide range of activities.

expected, household tasks and “tiny shoes for tiny feet” take a high"

priority in the catalogues of nu- 2 ‘
merous curvesome coeds. '

A cross—section of opinion, com-
plete with brilliant remarksand
caustic comments, is as follows: i

Bob Steen, C, says, in a forward-
looking tone of voice, “I shall play
leap-frog on the .Cathedral lawn,
just like a gay gazelle.” 2 _

Bob Wright, BA, prophesies,
“I’m going to break down. and
have a bottle of beer.”

With so many coeds looking for-
ward to marriage, Chris Manion,
C, has a rather unique approach to
the subject. She says, “Im going
to accost my mother and tell her I
know where ‘_a man is, and that
I’d like to get married if I can
talk him into it.”

Seeking to give vent . to her
Wanderlust which has been sadly-
neglectecl because of war-time re-
strictions, Blanche (You-take-the-
high-road-land-I’l1-take-the - low 
road) Unkovic_h, C, says, “I’m go.“
ing to take a ride. I don’t know“. .
where but I’m going to take a-
ride.” A . J
According to June Thomsori,
June prefers a career to marriage. ’ J
In fact, she plans to be a foreign
correspondent. She philosophizes, '
“You can have your ‘I love you
trulys.’ I’ll takegay Paree.” -

Dave Reisberg, C, adds his two
cents by predicting “First, I shall
raise a little cain. Then I’ll set-
tle down and raise chickens.” (Ed,
note-—He may’ mean blonde or
brunette, he didn’t say.)

So you see, student opinion on_
post-war plans’ displays a wide
diversity of projects and ideas. If .
you haven’t made yours yet, you -
had better get‘ into the groove be-
cause it’s later than you think.

Pitt Fails To
Get N CAA Bid;
\Vest Virginia
Accepts Offer
To N. Y. Games

By LARRY BONDY

Hopes were running high in the
Skyscraper until the news was
released late Thursday afternoon
that NYU would be District 2
representative in the NCAA. Now
the Panther’s 1944-45 basketball
edition is closed and tucked away
in Dr. Carlson’s center desk draw-
er.

Pitt and NYU were the logical
District 2 candidates to compete
in the tournament, but the Violets,
75 to 48 victory over CCNY last
Wednesday left no doubt with Dr.
Carlson, Lew Andreas, and Nat
Holman that Howie Cann’s basket
marauders should represent the
district.

‘The NCAA play is divided into
two sections, the Eastern and
Western, with games in the Gar-
den and Kansas City, March 22
and March 24. East—West winners
clash Marc-h 27 in the Garden for
the NCAA crown, the victor to
meet the survivor of the Garden
invitation tourney in a Red Cross
beneﬁt match on March 29.

The “Buzz Kids” of NYU go in-
to battle with a record. of 13 won
and 7 lost, but in their last two
games they’ve burned up the
courts with an 85-54 blitzing of
‘Temple, and the one—sided win
over CCNY.

>l< * *

When Pitt lost out in getting
the bid, it looked as if the district
college teams were through for
the season. But, up in Moun-
taineer territory, the folks didn't
feel that way, for Coach Brickels
kept his boys practicing. On
Thursday the Mountaineers. re-
ceived an invitation from Asa
Bushnell to play in the New York
Invitationals, and it was imme-
diately accepted by Athletic Di-
rector, Roy Hawley. The Panthers
had their eyes set on the NCAA
tourneys and overlooked a possi-
ble bid to the Invitation, thus let-
ting West Virginia grab it off.

The Mountaineers are we-lcom-
ed in Gotham because of the swell
showing they made this year in
knocking off NYU an-d Long
Island U. Another reason fo-r their
getting the bid was because of the
Metropolitan title they won in ’42.
The Mountainmen made basket-

ball history that year when they

were rated eighth in the tourney
and ‘came through with three
straight upsets to win the crown-

their moaning and groaning, and

places like French Lieiks, Muncie,

a little different. Rooms with
éold running water, inﬁelds cov-
ered with pools Of murky, swirl-
ing ﬂood waters, one blue-plate
special beanery in the town—it all
addS_ tip to spring training a la
1945. A

To top all these woes there’s
the almost unmentionable man-
power situation. The big league
boys still left in circulation are
coyer than a blushing, fuzzy-
cheeked high school kid about to
ring his best girl’s doorbell on
that all-important ﬁrst date.
They’d like to ring it, all right,
but, darn it, few of them have the
nerve. Until Washington turns
that yellow-greenlight up to a
rich emerald hue, they’re going to
sit tight and ﬁnd out what the
Score is.

Perhaps the best summation of
the muddle has been supplied by
Tom Meany, who declared that
baseball is in the same spot as the
unlucky gent who has been hauled
into a police station on suspicion
and doesn’t know whether or not
he’s going to be booked because

bill is the cup of coffee. Until the
status of the game is clariﬁed, no-

Word around Washington is to
the effect that the authorities are
not unkihrlly disposed toward the
game. But all hands are tied
tighter‘ than a shrunken sweater
until those men-of-the-people,
Congress tr>*_ you, untangle the tot-
tering stack of manpower bills
piled high before them. If the
game is not made a present of its
4-F atliletes, the magnates‘ might
just as wéfll buy themselves some
shiny new padlocks and turn their
spacious parks into‘ day nurseries.
They couldn’t carry on with pant-
ing, white-thatched gaffers and
bright-eyed, unshaven youngs‘te.rs.

Baseball is the national past-
time. Give it the break it needs.
I know . . they’ve cracked down
on the race tracks and blacked out
the bright spots but this is a lit-
tle different. It’s not essential,
but it’s an integrated part of our
national heritage. It’s everybody’s
game——hero-worshipping kids, G.

workers, screaming ladies day

. Too small to play in high school,
Nate Apple had to go to college to

Ford City’ where you have to re-
ceive an invitation to go out for
the team. The ﬁ've—foot, eight-inch
forward was then only ﬁve-two. '
Perhaps the most under-rated
man on the Panther ﬁve, Nate was
more than compensated by being
selected a member of the all-dis-
trict team.
In this years Westminster fray,
I the ’ diminutive forward played
what was probably his best game
of the year. Of course, Dodo Can-

‘Apple who handled the ball su-
perbly and set up Dodo on the

not have fared as well as he did.
Nate’s biggest thrill was in the

Geneva game of last season. The
CoVe‘nanters had outplayed the

of the ball game and were lead-

Phi Game Top Pi Lamsgii

SAE’s Rack Fourth Win

Phi Gams Cop Two

In the most interesting game of
the week, the Phi Garns defeated
the Pi Lams 34 to 33. To most
people this game did not appear
to be a surprise. However, to those

who realized the number of ex-
pert ballplayers that the Pi Lams
have acquired since rush week,
the Phi Gam victory was an up-
set. Trailing from early-in the
first quatrer until two minutes be-
fore the ﬁnal gun, the Phi Garns
never gave up hope. Time and
time again they c-ame within one
point -of the Pi Lams but were
never able to grab the lead. Final-
ly, with two minutes remaining
the Phi Gams surged ahead on
successive baskets by Anthony and
Sarules. They never relinquished
this le-ad as they went on to win
34 to 33. Outstanding for the los-
ers was Joe Pollock whose expert
ball handling enabled the Pi Lams
to build up their early lead.
* >54 =5‘-

Continuing at their merry pace
the Phi Gams trounced the Phi
Kaps 31 to 11. Uninteresting as the
game seemed, compared to the
other important contests, it show-
ed that tl_e Phi Garns are one ball
club that has improved 100 per
cent since rush week. Sporting
Anthony and Sarules as their main
threats the Phi Gams have a well-
balanced team" which will fare
well in the more crucial games of
the year.

Phi Kaps Lose Another

Reeling from their ﬁrst defeat,
the Phi Kaps were snowed un-
der in their second contest of the
week. The Pi Lams, using their
substitutes freely, easily overcame
the Phi Kaps 36 to 8. It was the
all-round power of the Pi Lams

that was responsible for this one-

sided defeat. Sporting men 
as Schafer, from the Taylor A111}-r ’ -

derdice varsity, and Klein, from

the Fifth Avenue varsity, the Pi»
Lams appear to be well on their .

way to a comeback in the IF

league.

SAEs Score Win

Playing without the services of.»
Payton, the SAEs surprised the’

Delts 28 to 19. The Delts fought
furiously throughout the entire
game but were never ‘able to surge
ahead. The biggest advantage for

the SAEs was that their height’

enabled them to control the bank-7
boards. Heading the SAEs was A17

Sciullo who showed why the-SAEs

In Business

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-

-trict averaged slightly low-er dur-

ing February than in January, de-
spite a pronounced rising ten-
dency in nearly all lines of eco-
nomic activity, according to the
Bureau of Business Research at
the University. Business in the
district averaged 3 per cent lower
in the first two months of 1945
than in the same two months of
1944. .

_ Retail sales held at record high
levels. Combined sales of the
Pittsburgh department stores were
16 per cent greater in the first
nine weeks of 1945 than in the
corresponding weeks of 1944.
‘These percentages make no allow-
ances for price changes, the
bureau stated.

Falling early in February to
about 80 per cent of capacity, the
steel ingot rate reached its low-
est rate in recent years. The in-

Feel Sick . . .

In case you girls happen to catch
a cold or sprain a wrist or want
to grab forty winks, the Student
Health service for women is tem-
porarily located on the sixteenth
ﬂoor with all the facilities of its
former oiiices.

Previously the location of the
military inﬁrmary, room 1617 has
been easily converted to .meet
the needs of Dr. Arleene M. Jam-
ison and her staff of nurses.

A large ofﬁce serves as the dis-
pensary, where the white plaster-
ed walls do as much to cure your
headache as the pills. Folding
screens separate this office from
the facilities
ments.

a bright, cozy conference and
reading room, furnished with
-chairs and large tables. Room

1617’-C is equipped with eight cots
for the sleepyheads.

Dr. J amison’s private ofﬁce is
separate from those mentioned,
and next to it is a small room fur-
nished - with two cots for emer-
gency cases. This section was the
“isolation ward” when these quar-
ters were used by the army.

Just as soon as their former of-
ﬁces are completed, Student
Health service for women will re-
turn to the twenty-eighth ﬂoor,
but in the meantime, say, “Six-
teen, please.”
