Questions the Future With Doctor of Laws Degree .

Of International Body

by DIANA McDONALD .

Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, speaking at the annual dinner
of the United Nations Association of Pittsburgh, stated
that “the United Nation’s capacity and its future is being
called into question.”

Dr. Johnson, guest speaker of the event held Monday
night at the Hotel Webster Hall, is president of the Carne-
gie Endowment for International Peace. His speech was entitled
“The United Nations Faces the Future.”

“Although the UN has a responsibility for the maintenance of
ninternavtviornal peace and security since 1945, this responsibility has
been sh.a-red. by other organizations,” he stated. The telephone “hot
-line” between Moscow and Washington has lifted some of the bur-
den of r-espon~sib~ility from the shoulders of the UN, yet has set
up a balance of terror between the two nations, “The balance of
te-rror has indeed served to maintain peace over the last 20 years,”
Johnson asserted.

 

Admitting that “in the ﬁeld of peace and ‘security the UN’s

recent record ha-s not been a
happy one,” he went on to say
that “the UN is not coping with
Vietnam” and that “the UN dis-
appointed many people in the
Middle East crisis.”

The present UN, limping along
from wounds sustained in Kash-
mir, Cyprus, and Israel, and
weak from lack of funds, is a
far cry from the envisioned
peace organization of 1945.

According to Johnson, the
cu-rrent UN reﬂectas the shape
of things throughout the world

- today.-

There is a “failure of the peo-
ples of the world, as represented
through their governments . . .
to recognize that each nation is
his brothers keeper.”

Reﬂecting on the major pur-
pose of the UN, he started that
“The ﬁrst element is the ca-
pacity for bringing about peace-
ful change; the second is keep-
ing apart potential enemies and
preventing the growth of hos-
tility; and the third is the peace-
ful settlement of international
disputes.”

Although “it is not the role
of a historian to predict” Dr.
Johnson commented on the ap-
proaching UN meeting, saying
that he did not think it would
‘be “one of the most fruitful as-
semblies, but I hope it wi-ll be
less acrimonious than those in
the past.” He expressed opposi-
tion to the pro-posed UN char-
ter revision, stating that the act
would be “self-defeating, a fail-

‘Pit’ Opens in Hunt Room
Grant Robbin Sings, Plays

by BETH LAZERICK

“No cover charge, Grant Rob-
bin, and atmosphere,” the signs
advertising “The Pit Coffee
House” could read. “The Pit,” a
student effort to establish a
place that the University com-
munity can enjoy and use for
the entire year, opened its doors
Monday night.

The coffee house, pondered
by Shelly Balkin and Bob Lip-
sitz and implemented by Ken
Adler and the Student Union
Board Social Committee, is lo-
rated in the Hunt Room of the
Student Union. Tables are cov-
ered by red and white checked

and late comers inevitably stand
around the room.

Students who ﬁlled the room
sat quietly and listened to the
piano playing of Bruce Goss, a
junior at the University, for the
first few minutes of the evening.
They could choose simply to sit
and listen or to order something
from the snack bar. University
women, including Nancy
Switkes, Enid Gloger, and Kathy
Kaplan, volunteered their time
to serve the guests of the cof-
fee house.

be on hand to greet all alumni.
N o admission will be charged.

Panther Name Entries
Copious, Lack ‘Class’

The ﬁrst two weeks of the Name the Panther contest brought
in more than 250 entries, but also brought a_ mixed -response from
the people on the Name the Panther Committee.

“Naturally we are very pleased with the number of entries,”
Commented Mike Brourman, one of the members. “But frankly,
we’re not pleased with the quality of the names we're getting.

“There seems to be a misunderstanding as to the kind of name
we're looking for,” said Jay Rosenstein. “We want something with
class; something that will last.‘So far, we’ve gotten very few really

good names.”

Brouman concurred with this.
“Most of the names are names
people give to race horses.
That’s not what we’.re looking
for.

“For instance,” he continued,
“LSU name their tiger Rajah
and Baylor named their bear
Brutus. We want something

along these lines.”

“We don’t want something
like ‘Chancellor's Delight,”’ said
Rosenstein. “That’s corny.’

The prize in the contest was
announced at the football pep
rally last Friday. It is a $50 Gift
Certiﬁcate at a store of the win-
ner's choice.

Besides Brourman and Rosen-
stein, the committee consists of
Cathy Walker, Paula Radvak
and Dean Billick, University
Sports Information director.

APODanceAims
To Sink Middies

Alpha Phi Omega will present
the world-renown jazz sound of
Woody Herman-and His Herd
in a dance and concert. The pre-
sentation will kick off the week-
end of the Pitt-Navy game. The
-theme of the evening’s entertain-
ment is “Sink the Mid-dies.”

Critics rank this edition Otf
Woody Herman's Herd as his
most outstanding, and unani-
mously agree that Herman be-
longs in the same class as Count
Basie and Duke Ellington.

Friday’s dance and concert
will take place in the Common’s
Room CL from 9 p.m. until mid-
night. Tickets are $1 per couple
and may be obtained at the SU
desk. Coat and tie are requested.

Velvet Underground

by JEANNE ELKAN

There are no real categories within which to classify
Andy Warshol’s album The Velvet Underground. Theré’s is
an acid-rock explosion that shatters all those familiar clich-
es concerning the combination of vocal and instrumental
sounds. Disparate imagery associations and instrumental
inventiveness obliterate any rational comprehensions —— so

comfortirng, but oh, «so very constricting. So, I’m hard put for a
description. I've found myself ‘immersed in a cataclysmic musical

extravaganza.

The Velvet Underground has produced a bizarre chunk of mu-
sic. Words are deliberately outrageous, circular, repetitious and
antilogical. The sound is primitive, vicious and frenzied, the dis-
sonance innudating us in its intensity. Taken as -a Whole the diffu-
sion loosens out -sensibilities, and we listen, abandoned to the dis-
cordant thrustings. It'.s a total assault upon our -senses, and we're
mesmerized by the incoherent imaginings elicited. So ﬂuid is the

Anti-war Organization
Raises Peace Funds

The “Yale Law Students End the war Committee,” a
newly formed peace organization, has completed one month
of a planned year-long, fund-raising effort on behalf of

nature of the music that all we
can hold to is a beat line——
steadily driving, pushing, pro-
peling us. But where to . . . to
what?”

The songs themselves take all
the confusion of our generation
and split them Wide open. The
son-g, Sunday Morning,” brings
the dawning; it’s just the wast-
ed years so close -'beh.i.nd.” This

- justiﬁably (?) though-free asso-

ciation imagery leads to ’Wait-
ing for My Man, about a junkie
cmnplied with “$26 in my -hand”
for a “junkie friend of m.ine.”

Is all this designed as a kind
of enlightenment on a society
where one “can taste the whip
or love not given lightly (Ven-
us in Furs)? A society where,
as in (All Tomorrows Partyss)
“’l'hursday’s child «is Sundays
clown for whom none will come
mourning?”

Does the “depravity” of the
compounded elements of guitar
improvisations, electronic feed-
back and free association imag-
ery further acknowledge the de-
-cadence of our, society? In a so-
ciety offering so little as ours
must me ﬁnd our “solution” in

, nullliﬁcation? Possibly this is in

the gloriﬁcation of narcotics,
where as in Heroin, “it makes
me ’feel like I'm a man when
I put -a "spike into -my vein.” In
this way, to escape from “the
big city where a man -cannot
be free . . . “With everybody put-
ting everybody else down.”
Not only does The Velvet Un-

an intense confrontation, but
we’re left gropin.g for answers.
But no «answers are given. For
just as Heroin begins with ‘‘I
don’t know where I'm going,” so
also does «it culminate with “Oh,

. and I guess that I just do-n’t

know.” Well, the associations

are ours to -determine. They can

Liberal Arts Cabinet Offers

Registration Suggestions

The Student Government Lib-
eral Arts Cabinet has forwarded
several suggestions for winter
term registration.

One of the areas the Cabinet
clariﬁed was the new free-elec-
tive system that was p-ut into ef-
fect this fall. Each student is
permitted two free electives in
his college career, to be taken
at the sophomore level or above.
A pass or fail grade cannot be
used as a prerequisite to an-
other course, in a student's for-
eign langu-age requirement, his
major, or in a co-urse taken to
fulﬁll a distribution require-

The organization was formed to encourage Yale Law
students to pledge $1 per week to the anti-war movement.

The recipient organizations
are the Resistance, Negotiation
Now, New Haven Draft Infor-
mation Center, National Law-
yer’s Guild Draft Defense Fund,
and Fifth Ave. Peace Parade
Committee. Checks totaling over
$170 were sent to these groups
last week.

Members predict that 100 of
the 500 students in the Law
School will eventually sign

‘pledges. It is expected that over

$2,000 will be raised during the
1967-68 school year.

According to Robert Sable,
’68 L, organizer of the pledge
movement, the committee hopes
to encourage other schools and
organizations to initiate similar
pledge campaigns. It is also
hoped that pledges and weekly
contributions will encourage par-
ticipants to commit themselves
to -a more serious involvement
in the anti-war movement.

Sable also commented that
“-the reaction to the pledges,
even from those not part.ici'p'at-
ing, has been very favorable. It
is obvious that sentiment against
the war among Yale law stu-
dents has increased consider-
ably since last year.”

mean whatever we want them
to mean. But by albu-m’s end
we're left exhausted and still

groping.

Violinist Werner Krotzinger

Performs Works By Bach

Werner -Krotzinger, famed
European violinist, will -be per-
forming works by Bach, Bee-

Krotzinger, who is making his

nearly eight years, will be play-
ing the P.artita No. 3 in E Major

for Piano by Beethoven, and the
Sonata in D Minor for Violin
and Piano by Brahms.

Mr. Krotzin er, who  now

ment. The free electives are of
primary value in ﬁelds of study
outside the student's major in-
terest.

Another area discussed by -the

Cabinet was the Honors Pro-

gram. Anyone with a strong B
average is eligible to take cer-
tain underclass Honor courses
(numbered in the 70's), with his
advisor’s consent. Usually the
political science, art, geography,
philosophy, history, sociology,
and English Honors courses, 73-
'75, can be scheduled by any
capable student, while the nat-
ural sciences tend to restrict en-
rollment in 705 courses to po-
tential Honors majors.

The underclass Honors ses-
sions are not limited to majors,
but are usually based on the
same -subject material as a cor-
responding 80 or core course;
the difference is a more infor-
mal class session, with discus-
sions and papers, rather than
lectures and tests.

The -Cabinet suggests speak-
ing to the instructor of an Hon-
ors course before registering for
it to ﬁnd out the exact content
of the course.

Other options are upperclass
Honors courses, which are lim-
ited in enrollment at the discre-
tion of the department, and
reading courses. These are of-
ten listed in the time schedule
under the 160’s (special prob-
lems). The procedure is as fol-
lows: a student, usually a major

ure, and would create more of a
Babel than we now haVe.”

The conference ended with a
question - and - answer period in
which Dr. Johnson did not care
to comment on the Israel-Egyp-
tian crisis because he “did not
really know the essential facts
in relation to it.” He favored the
admittance of Red China to the
UN organization, provided that
“the monkey is taken off our
backs and placed on their (Red
China’s) back so that they might
make the deci.sion to enter.”

The last question, posed by
the president of the Student
United Nations of Pittsburgh,
concerned the taking away of
the veto of Great Britain, France
and Nationalist China. “This
would be parading a power dif-
ferential more than is neces-
sary,” Johnson answered. “I op-
pose taking away the veto. If
this be logic,” he concluded,
"make the best of it.”

The student presents a read-

dent. Usually one or more pa.-
pers are included in the pro-

to offer the student a chance to

Stranger’ s Viewpoint

Reporter Visits Mississippi

by DAVID LLOYD-JONES

STRONG, Ark. (CPS) —— It
is a truism of journalism that
it i-s not possible to report events.
just the way people and events
react to a reporter watching
them. This is nowhere truer
than in the rural South.

To spend a week in Arkansas
and three days in this rural vil-
lage near the Louisiana border
is not to be able to tell what
these places are like or how
their people think. It is only to
‘be able to write, with whatever
objectivity one can m-anage, how
their people react to a long-
haired stranger who drives a
car with Mississippi plates and
speaks with a strange accent.

And what objectivity one can_
man-age is problematical. To vis-
it and talk with the ‘people of a
small Southern town is an ex-
perience which forces one to
suspend normal logics, to don
new thought processes. The two
policemen I encountered both
waved guns at me in the course
of ordinary conversation, and it
was not until I had return-ed to
the comparative normality of
Little Rock that I noticed there
was -something odd about the
fact. In the surrealistic ambi-
ence of rural Arkansas it its no-t
odd, shocking or even frighten-
ing. Until one returns to the
outside world, it slips one’s mind

_that the purpose of an “equaliz-

er” is to sh-oot people.

Children of both races have
one characteristic they share
with all Americans, but carry
perhaps to extremes in the
South, the desire to always give
the response desired, in word,
deed, and expression.

A white 13-year-old will tell a
racist joke with a wide grin on
his face, then switch to decry-
ing the attitudes of the people
he heard it from when he de-
tects that -one does not think it
funny. A black 14-year-old will
explore the ridiculous in telling
how much progress is being
made, how good the white folks
are and how the fellow blacks
cannot be trusted without white
supervision. Significantly, the
white child in question could ad-
just instantly to my disapproval,
while it did not penetrate to the
black one that I thought his
fast, pat answers ludicrous

I though revealing.

With adult Afro-Americans
one has two conversations, al-
ways. The first is the introduc-
tory one in which one is assured
of their good will, lack of ambi-
tion, trust in the white man,
and conﬁdence in the future.
Rap Brown is equated with the
Klansman, and one is duly thank-
ed for having passed the Civil
Rights Act.

After a while one makes the
transition to a second conversa-
tion. In one case this happened
as I was leaving after a point-
less 20 minutes with the vice-
principal of a black school. He
had reassured me that as a
guidance teacher he took no
steps to encourage integration,
and was not at all worried by
the inferiority of the equipment
at his school.

“Ah ain't seen every school in
Arkansas, but I guess we is as
good as any black school. ‘Course
the white schools is better every-
where, but that’s just the way
things is.”

As I got to the -door, his tone
changed a little, from deferen-
tial to plaintive: “Do you think
things will always be like this?
What is happening in Washing-
ton? Will the Federal govern-
ment ever do anything?”

I answered as truthfully as I
could, since I’m new to the US
that I expect civil rights en-
forcement to slow down because
of the coming election year, and
that I think the principle sup-
porters of civil rights are a tiny

powerless minority; I conﬁrmed

deferent, less “based in the easy
assumption of the superiority of
any white man, even one from
a college newspaper service.

One woman who is a cleaner’

at Arkansas Light and Power
with a year of college gets $1.15
an hour for a job at which
white men are paid $2.45. There
is the 16-year-old who failed at
the white school and returned to
the black one ‘because he had no-t
been prepared for the algebra
his grade was expected to know.
There is the angry pare-nt who
accuses the black «teachers of
sabotaging integration because
they don’t have the qualiﬁca-
tions to match the whites. There
is the youngster planning to
join the service because he
knows that is the only place
he’ll get mechanics papers.
There are all second selves, sym-
bols of the schizophrenic racism
behind the smiles ‘and the well-
lubricated traditions.

For the white, the correspond-
ing 'mental set is paranoia. He
knows his society is crumbling,
despite the radio programs that
tell him otherwise. Yet there is
enough decency in his tradition
to tell him that the offerings of
the liberal society that would
supplant his own. are rotten and
corrupt. -

“We’ve never had a Detroit in
the South” is a ready answer to
all questions. And while it is
irrelevant, it is nevertheless true
and evidence to the Southerner
that the lawyers, agitators, and

 

journalists who question him so
impudently have nothing to of-
for him as they tear down his
world.

The ancient grace of the South
is now corrupted. Hospitality is
a shot of bourbon from a bottle
under the counter, and erudition
is the well-memorized catalogue
of Northern ills. The ancient
trusts, the business done with a
handshake, give way to the ﬂ-
nance companies and the mod-
ern corporate legalisms. Nob-
lesse oblige has lost the Church-
illian ability to recognize that
the trade union consists of real
people with real concerns. The
surface decency that was possi-
ble when the Negro knew his
place crumbles when black men
ask for justice instead of char-
ity.

Despite this catalogue of de-
cadence, the South is no worse
and is probably better in most
ways than the North, at least to
my eyes, where progress and ef-
ticiency are not the capital vir-
tues. The Faulknerian ﬁxation,
the love-hate relationship to the
South, infects many there. For
the poor, the hatred of the land
that has given them so little is
combined with the clinging love
for what little they have. Among
the well-to-do one hears passion-
ate denunciations of both the
racism of the South, and the
commercial moralities of the
North.

The cult of the gun, the Will-
ingness to prove manhood
through violence comes from
those who were‘ raised in tlie
zeitgeist they decry. If most of
the religion of the South is based
on ignorance and Bible worship,

it is nevertheless possible to -

ﬁnd people who still follow the
laws of the prophets. The trials
of Job are being lived out by a
man I met, the town liberal of
Strong, whose sons have cere-
bral palsy and multiple sclerosis.
They live out their blighted lives
at home. In the North they
would be in asylums.

There is a peculiar attraction
to the South for even the out-
sider. The conservatism, nay,
the ossiﬁcation can seem -at
times to promise something bet-
ter than the worship of the dy-
nnamic, the compulsive world of
permanent change.

Israel Corps
Offers Work

ToVolunteers

A six-month Israel work vol-
unteer program will be leaving
Nov. 28 and Feb. 5. According
to David Goldberg of the Vol-
unteer Service Corps for Israel],
various types of work are offer-
ed to the volunteers.

Kibbutzim work, archaeologic-
al digs, teachers’ aids, social
work in slums, salvage in the
Old City, and agricuil.-tural work
are examples of the things of-
fered. However, “the volunteers
are going over there to pick
and choose," says Goldberg.
“They’ll build wherever work is
called for.”

Goldberg added that volun-
teers are needed for temporary
work and as a task force to set
up new settlements. He em-
phasized that volunteer work in
Israel might be of interest to
those interested in social prob-
lems. “Israel is an interesting
lab because it is -a developing
country.”

In addition to the six-month
program, there is also a one-
year program. For more infor-
mation on either, Contact Eddie

Dr. Kurtzman’s performance in the chancellorship dispelled any
i doubts about not only for his capabilities of solving the University’s ﬁnan-
cial problems, but also for leading our institution when questions such as
academic freedom arose. In this instance, he was staunch in his refusal
to_ budge to the unreasonable demands made by Helen Clay Frick on her

was indeed unique. He attended as many student functions as his hectic
schedule permitted, placing a high priority on our events. And although
his accomplishments are overwhelming, his natural friendliness and
warmth erased all barriers. He was a chancellor students considered a

Monday’s presentation of an honorary doctor of laws degree to
Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtzman marked one more attainment by
this remarkable man. For throughout his illustrious career, Dr. Kurtzman
has been recognized continuously for outstanding achievements not only
in his own ﬁeld of ﬁnance, but also in the academic arena.
-<. »At the dinner held in Dr. KUlrtzman’s honor, following the formal
presentation, former Chairman of the Board of Trustees Gwilym Price
fj greminisced about the doubts Dr. Kurtzman had about assuming the post
i of acting chancellor in January, 1966, following Dr. Crawford’s death. For
 Dr. Kurtzman’s career had been centered in the area of ﬁnance and he
‘i'“"l1ad only been at the University several months at the time of his appoint-

 that will make a little bit sad

‘a little bit happy when I am

At ﬁrst they searched
through the nearby country-

met if they had anything
that would make the king

 just a little bit sad when he

that they had been unsuc-
cessful. The king, though,
did not get angry. Instead,
he simply asked them to
l..eep searching.

So the ministers returned I

to the countryside, but this
time they traveled further
than before. Now, you must
remember that transporta-
tion was not by aii-plane but
by mule and horsecart, so
going 10(7) miles was no mean
task. But the ministers con-
tinued their search.

Luck was not with them,
"for, not only did they fail to

ﬁnd anything to meet the _

not even know what they
were looking for! “What,”
people would reply, “are you
crazy or something?”
FINALLY, in one small
village that is hardly even
on a map, an old white-hail:
ed man said that he did have
something that would make
the king a little bit sad when
he was happy and just a lit-
tle bit happy when he was
sad. With this, the man re-
turned to his shop and re-
turned with a small package.
The ministers smiled when
they saw what was in the
package and said that this
was exactly the right thing.

ution

Dr. Kurtzman is now serving as superintendent "for public instruc-
tion for Pennsylvania and is a member of Gov. Shafer’s cabinet. His fami-
liar ﬁgure is no longer an integral part of our University life. We had
hoped that he would remain at the University in his capacity as Chancellor

’ Emeritius, but it was inevitable that he would move on to another chal-
lenging assignment, working once more on a statewide level.

We congratulate Dr. Kurtzmlan on receiving his honorary degree, a

rightfully deserved recognition. We also take this opportunity to tell the
freshmen,.who did not attend the University when Dr. Kurtzman was at
the helm, not only what a ﬁne leader our Chancellor Emeritus was, but
also what a ﬁne person he is. His absence from the scene is a void to those
of us who had the privilege of working with him.

Dr. Kurtzman stated Monday evening that his two years at the

Thanking the man, they
started back for the king’s
village.

When the ministers re-
turned, the king asked them
what they had brought him.
They gave him the package
and the king opened it.
“Yes,” he said, “this will
make me just a little bit sad
when I am happy, and just
a little bit happy when I am
sad.”

What was the gift, you
ask ? It was a simple silver
ring which had the follow-
ing words inscribed on it:
This too shall pass.

WHEN YOU think about
those four words you realize
that they can change your
attitude toward things and
people. I wish more students
would remember these words
because the University would
be a better place to live in if
we did not complain so in-
cessantly, or, for that mat-
ter, if people were not so
“happy” all the time.

Next time you ﬂunk a test,
next time you ﬁnd a ten dol-
lar bill on the sidewalk, re-
member, This too shall pass.

The Pitt News is one of
America's great student news-
papers. The reason for this is
that some of America's great
students are responsible for
producing this great student
newspaper.

These great students can be
working greatly on The Pitt
News in the offices on the
fourth ﬂoor of our great Stu-
dent Union until greatllours
of the night.

The Pitt News is a student
newspaper by virtue of the
fact that the great students
publishing it are true stu-
dents. This, our great Univer-
-sity, was conceived in the be-
lief that American youth has
a. lot to learn, and those
youths publishing The Pitt
News have as much to learn
about anything -as ‘anyone.

And, lastly, The Pitt News
is a newspaper. In the great
tradition of the American
pres-s, our student newspaper
presents news, features and
sports with an unjaun-diced
eye for objective, in-depth re-
porting.

Isn't that great?

  
 

University were the two happiest: years of his life. As Mr. Price stated,
they were also two of the ﬁnest years for our University.

Letters to

Senator Defines

Her Role in SG

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a recent Pitt News column,
the role of a Student Govern-
ment (SG) senator was charac-
terized as lacking in deﬁnition.
I am forced to agree with this
general point, but feel that some

nanaususususnm

clariﬁcation is needed. Ideally.

an SG senator holds great re-
sponsibility and power overstu-
dent affairs. He or she may ini-
tiate legislation, approvei"presi-
clcnti-al nominees to special
(events, decide on all allocations
for student activities, serve on

speciﬁc sub-co-mittees, and act as.

a liason between the student
body and its executive: the pres-
ident and vice-president o-f SG.

However, most students (in-
cluding senators") see only -the
bill-producing aspect as truly in-
dicative of senatorial me-ri»t.
They tend, therefore, to concen-
trate on the quantity of resolu-
tions and their pass-age rather
than the full-time job of being a
vital link in the entire Universi-
ty community. I am the ﬁrst to
admit that our SG meetings are‘
long (female senators now even
receive free quarter hours for
meetings) and sometimes be-
come reduced to discussions of
procedural techniques. It is
hoped that the Parliamentarian
made mandatory for next term’s
Senate will help to restore a lit-
tle decorum. Yet, I am ﬁrmly
convinced that these “distaste-
.1'ul” sides of SG meetings are
both symptomatic and Vital to
the Senate. The questioning of
an informed, intelligent Senate
is vital; the ﬂoundering around
for guide-‘posts is symptomatic
of the lack of deﬁnition.

Why, then, is the role of a
SG senator So vague? Must it
continue to be -so? The ﬁrst
question I must answer by ask-
ing others. How many perspec-
tive senatorial candidates have
ever attended a SG meeting?
HOW many are Chosen to run
because they have a well-known
name, a pretty face, or because
they belong to a powerful fra-
temity 01‘ sorority? During the
campaign, who really cares what
the individual senatorial candi-
dates feel about their roles?

Atlhough the 1967 SG Senate
has been criticized, sometimes

vjus-tly so, I believe it has made

some contributions. Publicity for
SG is now coordinated and more
prominant than in the past, the,
new realms o-f off-campus hous-
ing and traditions «are being ex-

the Editor

unauaumnnnnlls

plored, clariﬁcation of continu- .

ing segments of SG (notably
(Recognitions Committee, by-
laws revisions, and new alloca-
tions procedures) have occurred,
and the machinery has ﬁnally
been set in motion for ‘the Presi-
dent’s Council and University
Review Board.‘ These have been
attempts at more concrete deﬁni-
tion for future Senates.

The fact that criticism -exists
of sena.torial action points to the
increasing awareness that SG,
as the representative body of -all
students, should be the one to
respond to University problems
and their solutions. This aware-
ness implies that the under-
standing of SG’s function has
come a long way.

The involvement of a SG ‘sen-
ator does not have to be string-
ently deﬁned to be effective, but
the knowledge that there is the
duty -to become involved is es-
sential to any perspective can-
didate. We cannot afford not to
have a questioning Senate, but
neither can we have a Prufrock-
like group of people who can
only ask and never do.

Elevator Graffiti

Editor, The Pitt News:

Besides being inoperative much
much of the time, there is a.
more serious problem with the
elevators in the dormitory tow-
ers, and that is the Ptoblem of
the “graffiti” on the walls. Graf-
ﬁti has come to be a vital link
in the campus communications
system, and the storage of graf-
ﬁti on the elevator walls is a
concern of all elevator patrons.

In an attempt to -alleviate the
problem, I make the following
proposal: line the elevator walls
and doors with lightweight slate.
And around the elevator, place
chalk rails to be periodically
supplied with fresh chalk and
erasers.

New graffiti can then be add-
ed instantly (without the tire-
some bothcr of having to hunt
for crayon or pen knife), and,
old graffiti can be easily dis-
patched with erasers. Grapevine
communication would increase
in speed ten-fold. And at the
next Parents’ Weekend, the
more “avante-garde” graffiti can
be quickly deleted simply by
erasing it and temporarily hid.
ing the chalk. This method, I
believe, would far outweigh the
present one of scrubbing, re-
painting, or sandpapering.

Study In Contrast

(Ed. Note: This article, the
fourth in a series about the 1967
Stmlcnt Union European trip,
was written by Miss Harriet Fri-

day, assistant director of the Stu-I

dent Union. Miss Friday accom-
panied the tour group and she
was one of the several Pittslmrgh,
members of the tour who went to
Czechoslovakia, when the tour was
in Vienna.)
by HARRIET FRIDAY

It bore little resemblance to
Check Point Charlie, this quiet
little countryside checkpoint at

{Elie border station between Aus-

tria and Czechoslovakia. Yet all
01 us Americans, and probably
our German guide, Alf (who
had escaped from East Germany
at age 17) felt somewhat tense
and uneasy as we wa-ited an
hour while the Czechoslovakian
guards examined our visas, pass-
ports, and the bus.

Alf knew the ropes. He knew,
too, that a gift of American
cigarettes for the Czech guards
would ease the grossing. The
guards responded as Alf had
hoped. They were friendly and
bid us a good trip to Bratislava.
The last guard, stepping off the
bus, turned and said, “I’m sor-
ry.” Speculating on his words,
we crossed into Czechoslovakia.

Bratislava, situate-d on the
Danuke River, lay just seven
miles from the Austrian border.
As we reached the city, its 250,-
000 inhabitants were leaving
their jobs and heading home-
ward. '1‘1he lack of rush-hour traf-
ﬁc left us questioning whether
we one and two—car American
families really “had «it so good”
after all. In Bratislava, where
only a few can afford ca.rs, the
streets are practically empty.
But -the sidewalks are crowded

..»~—.ana passengers queue in long
‘Wlines waiting for buses and trol-

leys.

We were traveling in a Ger-
man-made bus and were imme-
diately recognizeable as for-
eigners. The wide-eyed pedes-
trians nuged each other as we
passed, and responded to our
waves with smiles.

Bratislava’s cobble-stoned
streets led us past many small
shops, all dull and drag com-
pared to the gay and attractive
shops we had .seen in Vienna the
previous day. Many of the homes.
were in poor repair and remind-
ed me of East Berlin and her
-'bOI'Illb-pOCk€d buildings, left un-
repaired since World War II.

AN OPEN LETTER TO CHANCELLOR

How long can it go on? How long can University offi-
cials sit in their boxes at the Stadium and allow Pitt’s proud
football heritage to become the laughing st-ock of the na-

69 tion? How long can University officials expect student sup-

port for Pitt football when it doesn’t have the proverbial
chance of a snowball in hell to compete against the pro-
grams of Miami, UCLA, and Notre Dame?

HOW 1011!; will Sports Illustrated continue to call Pitt
a patsy? And when Wlll people want to make the trek up
the hill to watch Pitt football again?

Pitt will not win against the caliber of opposition every-
one wants Pitt to play, unless there are changes in the
football program.

IF UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS refuse to rejuvenate

Pitt football, the-y had better de-emphasize it and fast.
Since the schedule is set for the ‘next eight years or so, that
would only mean -eight more years of humiliation before
the de-emphasis took effect.

To be blunt, either Pitt has to drop teams like Notre
Dame or do at least some of the things they do. There is
absolutely no consistency between Pitts program and the
programs of Pitts opponents. ~

The stranglehold on Pitts program has got to be lifted,
and the officials of this University are the only ones who
can do that job.

The problems with Pitt football are numerous. All of
them can’t be adequately treated in this one column. But
the Pitt News promises to replace the naivete of its read-
ers with an awareness of the true situation.

PITT FOOTBALL IS GOVERNED first by standards
set by the Administration here, next by those established
by the ECAC, and ultimately by the rules and regulations
of the NCAA. .

If Pitt abided soley by NCAA standards, that is, have
a 1.6 minimum academic average, allow junior college ad-
missions and give sophomores eligibility, and permit red-
shirtiiig, there wou.ldn’t be a major disaster now. No one
wants to lower,,adinission requirements, but the point is
that many of Pitt’s opponents now and future, abide solely
by the NCAA criteria.

Even schools that have additional standards, as Pitt
does, somehow manage to outprogram Pitt. Penn State has
no foreign language requirement. Penn State places its
football players out of Liberal Arts for the most part, and
into Forestry, Business, or Physical Education.

PITT HAS NO UNDERGRADUATE business program
and a Pitt physical education major is not geared to teach-
ing and coaching but rather to biology and chemistry. There
are no physical education majors -on the varsity football
team right now.

Schools such Harvard, Princeton, Army, and Navy turn

out over 100 candidates for fall camp. Miami, UCLA, Notre

__ Dame, Berkeley, Duke, and Southern California redshirt and

accept junior college transfers. Panther senior Ray Radako—

Vich played Saturday against a Miami player who graduated
high school two years before he did.

The list of inconsistencies can go on and one, and losing
football at Pitt will go on and on unless University oﬁicials
decide otherwise.

Hart Stresses Fundamentals

‘For Distraught Jungle Cats  

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor

(Quarterback Bob Bazjz/lair was injured in Monday’s practice
am] is a doubtful starter Saturday.)
Football people used to pity Ken George.

George, the Panthers’ business manager for 19 years,
has never seen a football game at the Stadium. Before every
game, he completely absorbed with the selling of tickets.

Yet where he may have missed some good football in those
years, he isn’t missing much now. In addition, George's work has

tailed off lately. Last year for
the Navy game, 39,029 paid to
see the Panthers lose, 24-7. But
this year only 25,000 are ex-
pected. . .

The reason may lie in last
week’s disastrous loss to Miami,
58-0.

“Miami is too good for Pitt,”
Dave Hart ﬁnally said. “We
made too many mistakes, and
when you make so many mis-
takes, everything caves in.

“I feel sorry for the kids who
have to face the public,” said
Ha-rt in a solemn after game
interview.

“I’m embarrassed to face the
public myself,” related Hart.

Hart called the team complete-
ly ﬂat,” and to the spectators
who paid $3’to $5 to sit in the

‘stands, it certainly Was. Never-

theless, Hart will try to prepare
the Panthers for the second of
ﬁve straight home games, a
homestand which may go down
as the worst in history.

Hart wanted to get “people
who'll block” in the offense so
he made more changes, adjust-
ments after losing, but never
made after winning.

Art Alois, a 6-3, 222 pound
junior, ‘was’ moved from guard
to tackle, replacing Frank Pec-
inan. Warren Allen, the sopho-
more from Homestead High, re-
turned to the ﬁrst team guard
position after an injury had
forced his demotion to secon

Another injured sophomore,
Chuck Hutchko moved to the

ﬁrst team center spot. An in-
fected knee had sidelined him..

Before the changes were made,
a comment usually set aside for
spring practice, the teaching
part of college football.

“We mu-st regroup. We’ll have
to go over the basic fundamen-
tals, blocking and tackling,”
Hart said. In this way, Hart is
preparing for the Midshipmen.

Navy, an upset victim for Wil-
liam and Mary last Saturday,
shouldn’t score like Miami, a
team Hart considers “deﬁnitely
equal to UCLA, and a team
which probably has more depth.”

Last Saturday, Hart said the
Panthers “weren’t strong enough
or quick enough to block Mi-
ami,” and then on Sunday, he
read assistant coach Carl Ko-
kor’s Navy scouting report.

It said: Navy is a quick, high-
ly spirited team which gives
you that second effort, that sec-
ond block, and gang tackling.
They play as a team.

“People have moved the ball
on them (Navy)/’ said Kokor.
Navy has allowed three touch-
downs a game, b-ut the Jungle
Cats again are headed for an-
other record in allowing points.

In ﬁve games, opponents -have

averaged 31.6 points. Last year,

opponents averaged 32.6 points
a game. With games with Not-re
Dame and Penn State yet to
come, a new mark isn’t impos-
sible.

Especially since ﬁve defensive
players are ailing. Sophomore

of Saturday's game was this . . -

Defensive back Mickey Depp
sprained his jaw, and his con-
dition is questionable.

probably start are defensive

bad bruises; middle linebacker

Depp Hcmkers To Discover
Runback Knack Against Navy

by ROY JACOBS
Nothing in football, college or pro, is
more exciting than a long kickoff or punt

return. Unfortunately, this commodity has

been rare indeed for the Panthers since Eric
Crabtr-:=c’s departure to the pro ranks-

In fact, one of the many sore spots in Sat-
urday’.s 58-0 drubbing by Miami was the Pan-
tliers’ trouble ﬁelding kiickoffs in the end zone.
And one of the principle offenders was defen-
sive halfback Mickey Depp. It seems he was
having trouble catching the ball.

“I was catching right in the -sun,” Mickey
explained, “and I couldn't pick them up. The
ﬁrst one was lucky because it came down right
in my arms. That sun is really terrible.”

Depp returned the opening kickoff 24 yards,
which is slightly above the college average of
18-20 "yards. After that, he had his problems,
largely due to poor footing which resulted from
wearing a pair of short spikes. Although George
Pribish replaced him on the “suicide team” later,
Mickey ﬁgures to return the ball against Navy
this weekend.

“George did a good jo ,” offered Depp. “But
lie does a lot of running on offense and I think
the coaches will want to save him.” But to Mick-
ey, kickoff returns are only half the job.

“A lot of guys hate punt returns,” he said.
“They don't like the ball way up in the air. The
idea of all those tacklers charging downﬁeild
scares them. Actually, I like punt returns better.

“A return is just luck, anyway,” he con-
tinued. “If you can hit the right hole, it doesn’t
matter if the block is there or not.”

Still, Dep_;)’s main job is defensive halfback,
rind ki"k returns are only an important side-
!"ne. Saturday he was the Panthers’ defensive

W. Tl 2:1" faster than you can say Opalsky
the defense was behind 18-0, through almost no

 

fr-.u-It of its own. It's hard playing inspired foot-
ball against those odds. _

“When we g-et behind to some of these good
footba‘-... teams, we go out there and have «a good
time,” Mickey mused. “We just hit anybody
in sight.” Obviously, the defense has been do-
ing a lot of hitting.”

But, another weekend means another new

opponent, usually a tough one. Now it’s time .

to get ready for Navy.

“Coach Hart had a genenal meeting with
the freshman and varsity," reported Depp, “and
he really let loose. He said this game means a
lot. I think we’re going to Win. Practice has
been just like it was the week before Wiscon-
sin. The spirit was lacking last week. I guess
some of the guys just didn’t think we could
beat Miami.” .

Navy isn’t exactly waiting to be knocked
off, and Depp knows from whom most of the
pressures on the defense will be coming——John
Cartwright and Rob Taylor.

“Cartwright running or throwing to Tay-.

lor will be our biggest problem,” suggested Depp.
“They’re doing a. lot more passing this year. Tay-
lor's caught 34 passes already. I’m sure he's going
to be up for us after losing to William and Mary.’.’

Mickey’-s had a good time pllaying against
Navy. Last year he returned an interception 88
yards for the Panthers only score.

“They made a big fuss over last year's inter-
ception ” remembered Depp. “I’m sure they're go-
ing to run a long pattern on me. Oartwri-ghIt’s

been pretty good to me. My sophomore year I -

intercepted two passes.”

Returning a pass interception for a score is
almost as exciting as returning a punt or kick-
off. Stitl, nothing would be more exciting for
Panther fans than a win over Navy. Mickey will
be doing more than his fare share against the
Middie-S Saturday.

Esposito’s Torn Rib Cartilage
Hinders Cubs’ Rushing‘ Offense

by JERRY GRUEBEL

Penn State won the open-
ing toss and they elected to
kick off. The kick was a
good one and it was fumbled.

._ The freshman football team re-

covered the basil, but on their
two-yard line. Quarterback Don
Plusquellic needed’ working
room. He handed off to his full-
back and after a cnashing, driv-

ing run up the middle, the ball
was -on the 11 yard line.

The offense was still to deep
in their own territory for safe-
ty. Plusquellic handed off to his
fullback again, «and after an-
other determined run up the
middle, the ball was on the 17-
yard line. The offense had Work-
ing room.

But the fullback, Tony Esposi-
to, was injured on that play, and
the offense was limited to one
touchdown the rest of the way.

I The absence of Esposito hurt.

Esposito is quiet off the ﬁeld.
But once he grabs the football,

back carried the ball 10 times
for 46 yards and ' two touch-
downs. And he did it before the
half-time -gun sounded. Espos-ito
was ejected from the game in
the middle of the ‘second quar-
ter when he argued with the
referee about a call, and he lost
his clnanee to run in the second-
half.

The injury that Elsposito ‘suf-
fered last week could be seri-
ous. It could prevent him from
‘playing against Ohio State.

“He has a torn rib cartilage,”
said one of the trainers. “I don’t
know how long he’ll be out. But

Esposito doesn't think so. He
wants to play.

“I'll be alright,” hopes Esposi-
to. “I’ll be ready for the Ohio
State game.”

Maybe Esposito will be ready.

Maybe he’ll be able to play the
entire game. And most probably,
he’ll gain big yardage on the
ground ‘If he gets his chance.

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

A network of computers to put confusing facts and
ﬁgures into perspective. '

And that can be an advantage.

’ How? Well, take Ford Motor Company. Were a giant
in an exciting-and vital business. We tackle big problems.
Needing big solutions. Better ideas. And that‘s where you
come -in". Because it all adds up to a real opportunity for young
engineering graduates like yourself at Ford Motor Company.

Come to work for us and you'll be a member of a select
College Graduate Program. As a member of this program,
you won‘t be just another “traince“ playing around with
“make work" assignments.

You'll handle important projects that you‘ll frequently
follow from concept -to production. Projects vital to Ford.
And you’ll bear a heavy degree of responsibility for their
success.

You may handle as many as 3 different assignments in
your__ﬁrst two years. Tackle diverse problems. Like ﬁguring
how high a lobe on a cam should be in order to yield a certain
compression ratio. How to stop cab vibration in semrtrailer
trucks. How to control exhaust emmission.

, Soon you’ll start thinking like a giant. You‘ll grow bigger
because you’ve got more going for you.

Complete testing facilities to prove out better ideas.

And at Ford Motor Company, your better ideas wont
get axed because of a lack of funds. (A giant doesn't carry a
midgets wallet, you know.)

Special programs. Diverse meaningful assignments. Full
responsibility. The opportunity to follow through. The best
facilities. The funds to do a job right. No wonder 87% of the
engineers who start with Ford are here 10 years later.

If you’re an engineer with better ideas, and you’d like
to do your engineering with the top men in the ﬁeld, see the
man from Ford when he visits your campus. Or send your
resume to Ford Motor Company, College Recruiting De—
partment.

You and Ford can grow bigger together.
