Chuck Farinella, president of the lnterfraternity Council, will
meet with all fraternities to review Pitt's alcohol policy.

Pitt students, for the first time
in university history, will be given
the opportunity to escape class-
es to a blue ocean or a snow-
capped mountain for one week
designated as spring break.

Two popular vacation spots
where Pitt students will venture
are Florida and Vermont.

Students have heard about
spring break in Florida either
through Hollywood's depiction,
MTV or the media. But what is it
exactly that draws college stu-
dents there year after year?

’’It’s a combination of things,”
said Lee Daniel, a spokesperson
at the Daytona Beach Chamber of
Commerce. He explained that
one reason many students may
travel down to Daytona, F|a., in
March is due to the summer—|ike
climate. He said that during
spring break, temperatures
should be in the mid-70s with the
”clean, clear" water in the
mid-60s.

Daniel described the 23 miles
of beaches as being ”very clean,
flat and about 500 feet wide,”
which he added, ’’leads to a real
good time.”

Daniel commented that one
major advantage Daytona Beach
has over many other vacation
spots is that, due to publicity from
past years, many large corpora-
tions choose to sponsor activities
there and to draw popular bands
and celebrities.

This year, Budweiser is spon-
soring events and concerts to
help college students enjoy them-
selves. One ”highlight” event is
billed as the ”world’s largest
squirt gun fight,” called the Bud

Clazer Chase. Budweiser is also
sponsoring a concert with
Richard Marx and Squeeze,
which will be shown live by
MTV, broadcasting spring break
from Daytona for the third
straight year.

Another service Budweiser will
provide for students is ”Pit
Stops,” located on major Georgia
highways on the way to the Flori-
da beaches, offering travelers free
coffee, doughnuts and other
refreshments, as well as tourist in-
formation.

The Interfraternity Council is in
the process of developing a plan
pertaining to ”party procedures”
for Pitt fraternities.

Paul Chappano, external vice
president of IFC, said ”We want
to completely eliminate any
charging for parties."

According to a letter sent to IFC
and Panhellenic Association
presidents on Jan. 7, 1986, by
former director of Student Activi-
ties, Andrew Smith Jr.: ”Fraterni-
ties and sororities are prohibited
from using tickets, donations, raf-
fles or other means for charging
admission to any function where
alcohol is provided.” This policy
is in compliance with Pennsylva-
nia Liquor Code 492.3 and the
university's alcohol policy.

”We have been in contact with

will be doing some promoting of
its own. Visitors to Daytona this
year will see the opening of Club
Coca—Cola, a dance club open to
all students that will serve no al-
cohol. Daniel said that this
should offer a good alternative to
those students under 21 years of
age.

Daniel said that police enforce-
ment in Daytona has been effec-
tive in keeping order during
spring break. -

”The police are used to big
crowds and try to help, not hass-
le. Students also need to realize

ls Oakland the place
to go for a vacation?

By Keri D. Smith
Staff Writer

As spring break quickly ap-
proaches, many students are
buying new bathing suits and
making their final travel plans.
However, for those students
lacking the funds or the desire
for an out-of-state vacation,
next week is a good time to in-
vestigate the recreational pos-
sibilities of Pittsburgh.

Pitt freshman Donald Col-
lins said he will stay in Oak-
land for spring break because
’’I need the money from my
job," and ”there’s nothing else
to do."

On the contrary, there are
several local events scheduled
for Pitt's spring break week.

Mia East from WDVE—FM
said that there will be a con-
cert at the Syria Mosque on
March 5 featuring the O—Jays

and Levert and a second Frank

Zappa concert on March 8.’
Also, The Temptations will be
at the Holiday House March 9
and 10.

The Carnegie has scheduled
the Claude Bolling Trio and
John—Pierre Rampal to play on
March 7 and 9. Both concerts
are sponsored by the Pitts-
burgh Symphony.

Aside from concerts, the Ice
Capades, featuring Torvill and
Dean, will be skating from
March 8 through 13.

March 6 is the last day for
the Pittsburgh Broadway ser-
ies, Can Can, at Heinz Hall.
On the dramatic side, Mac-
Beth is playing from Feb. 23
through March 6 at the Bene-
dum Center.

Mike Smith, a Pitt freshman,
said, ”|’l| probably watch
some TV [during spring break]
and go out at night: to the rno-
vies or go to friends’ houses.

IFC stresses Pitt's alconol policy

every fraternity,” said Chuck
Farinella, IFC president. ’’All of
the presidents are aware of it [the
enforcement of the policy].’’

Chappano said, ”This is not a
change of policy; we're just let-
ting them [fraternities] know
we're going to enforce it now.”

The IFC board and its represen-
tatives have been attending each
fraternity's individual meetings
since Feb. 21 to stress the regu-
lations of the university's alcohol
policy.

"With the past [IFC] execs, this
[the alcohol policy] was not a
concern of IFC,’’ Farinella said.

Jim Sluck, former IFC president,
could not be reached for
comment.

Farinella said that the differ-
ence between the present
administration and past ones is
that, ”none of the other admini-
strations ever bothered to walk

right into a chapter.”

”We're being straight up
front,” said Dave Wilcox, IFC in-
ternal vice president. ”We're put-
ting everything right on the line.
They [the fraternities] understand
and know our motivations.”

Farinella said, ”The details for
enforcing this plan may take two
weeks or the rest of the term. It's
something we're going to adhere
to, though —— and hopefully put
into the bylaws. That way, the
next administration will have to
adhere to it, too.

’’It’s not my idea to incriminate
any fraternity at this time,"
Farinella added. ”This is an
educational service, as well as a
means to bringing it out in the
openX'

Wilcox added, ’’It’s a total
change, but we're hoping some
very positive changes may come
from it."

that there are rules and regula-
tions," he said. "There is no al-
cohol allowed on the beach.

"[Daytona] is traditionally a
moderately priced resort town.
We have not received complaints
in the past [about prices]." He ad-
ded, "Hotels realize we need to
be competitive.”

One Pitt student, who wished
to remain unidentified, is travel-
ing to Daytona by way of a trip
sponsered by the Pitt Program
Council. He said, "My roommate
and l have been dieting and
working out for weeks to get
ready to take Daytona by storm."

According to University Travel
Sevice, located on Forbes
Avenue, a round-trip airline tick-
et to Florida will run about $220.
A hotel room with double oc-
cupancy on the beach runs about
$70 a night.

Many of the hotels require stu-
dents to leave a $50 to $100
damage deposit, which is
returned to students at the end of
their stay. All prices are suscepti-
ble to change.

For those who do not desire, or
cannot afford the warm sun and
the cool, clear water of Florida,
there is an alternative. It's called
Snow Break '88, and it is being
sponsored by Mount Snow, Vt.
and Orangina soft drink.

’’It's a blast — we have a great
time every year. Last year, we had
over 200 students, and they were
all from a college in Florida," said
a Mount Snow spokesperson.
”The snow is fast and good, and
at that time of the year [mid-
March], the weather is usually
good in Vermont.”

She explained that although the
weather was pleasant last year,

New England weather is notori-

ously unpredictable.

For the ski lover, Mount Snow
offers 75 trails, 80 percent of
which are covered with snow-
making machines, 16 chair lifts
(including a new high—speed,
base-to-summit quad), five triple
chairs and nine double chairs.

The mountain consists of four,
interconnected areas including
the North Face, which ”boasts
some of the most challenging ex-
pert terrain in New England," ac-
cording to Steve Crosby, a Mount
Snow communications assistant.

For the serious skier, Mount
Snow will be holding a College
Cup Ski Race as part of the Snow
Break '88 festivities. The winners
of first, second and third place
will receive new skiis, compli-
ments of Mount Snow and
Orangina.

Along with the race, Snow
Break '88 will consist of a varie-
ty of other events for both the ski-
er and non-skier. These include
the Welcome Party; Snow Ar-
chitecture 101; Snow Golf; a
Hawaiian Jamboree, featuring of
a live D.J. and mixed drinks; a
Klondike Toboggan Race and a
basketball Hoop Shoot. Prizes
will be awarded at all contests,
according to the spokesperson.

Although the drinking age in
Vermont is 21, during spring
break the resort night club, the
Snow Barn, announced it will
lower the drinking age for all vis-
itors to 19‘/2. Valid, photo iden-
tification is required.

According to a spokesperson
from the state liquor control
board, this is possible due to a
grandfather clause that went into
effect last year. Since Vermont's

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 2, 1988

Delvalle calls for economic boycott of Noriega

' WASHINGTON —— Panama's
president in hiding, Eric Arturo
Delvalle, called on all Panamani-
ans Tuesday not to engage in any
financial transactions with the
authorities who seized power
from him last week.

The proclamation contem-
plates a series of steps aimed at
creating-a cash flow crisis for the
new government, which Delvalle
regards as unconstitutional.

The document, made public by
Delvalle’s ambassador in
Washington, Juan B. Sosa, states
that payment of debts, taxes and
other obligations should be with-
held until constitutional govern-
ment is restored in Panama.

The Panamanian National As-
sembly, dominated by forces loy-
al to military strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega, deposed Del-
valle last Friday after the presi-
dent had attempted to fire

Noriega as defense chief.

In a parallel measure, Panama-
nian opposition leader Gabriel
Lewis, a former ambassador to
Washington, said legal steps were
being taken to freeze Panama's
assets in the United States.

Lewis gave few details about
the measure, saying that public
disclosure could enable Panama-
nian authorities loyal to Noriega
to take counter-measures. He said
U.S. courts were being asked to
attach any Panamanian govern-
ment airliners located in the Unit-
ed States.

Hostages ’innocent’;

captors set them free
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The group
that claimed it kidnapped two
Scandinavian relief workers said
they were freed Tuesday after be-
ing ”proven innocent.”
The whereabouts of the two

men were not immediately
known, but the Swedish Foreign
Ministry confirmed that Jan Sten-
ing, 44, of Sweden and William
Jorgensen, 58, of Norway had
been released.

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS
 

The Revolutionary Cells said in
a handwritten Arabic statement
delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut late Tuesday that
after the two U.N. Relief and
Works Agency employees were
”proven innocent, they were
released.”

The statement did not say of
what the two men were proven
innocent, or where they were set
free. It was accompanied by one
photo showing both men.

Stening and lorgensen, who

work for an agency that cares for
Palestinian refugees, were ab-
ducted Feb. 5 near Sidon, provin-
cial capital of south Lebanon.

Earlier Tuesday, the kidnappers
of a U.S. Marine officer said in a
statement that they are deter-
mined to put him on ”trial” for
espionage.

The typewritten Arabic state-
ment from the Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth, said the
’’trial’’ would begin once the in-
terrogation of Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins was completed.

 good for you. It's bad for
you. It causes cancer. It prevents
cancer. It makes you more fertile. It
makes you less fertile. You should
get on it. You should get off it.

All the conflicting information
ﬂoating around about the Pill is
enough to make you contemplate
abstinence. We recommend a far
less drastic measure: educate your-
self. Gather all the information you
can from reliable sources and,
together with your doctor, make the
decision that’s right for you.

Here are a few facts to start you

off. First, the Pill is actually many
pills. Since its introduction in 1960,
it’s evolved from one high dosage
product into many much lower in
dosage. From 150 megs. ofestrogen
in 1960. down to 35 or less today.
Yet, it’s still the most effective form
of birth control available to you
other than sterilization.

What about the Pill and breast
cancer? Although there are con-.
flicting reports concerning this
issue, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol reported that women who took
the Pill—even for 15 years-ran no
higher risk of breast cancer than
women who didn’t.

The CDC also reported that ovar-
ian and uterine cancer are substan-
tially less common among women
who use oral contraceptives. In
addition, Pill users are less likely to
develop benign breast disease, pel-
vic inﬂammatory disease (tubal
infections) and ovarian cysts. I

One of the Pill’s greatest areas of
misconception is conception. Does
the Pill make you less fertile? Stud-
ies indicate that if you were fertile
before you took the Pill, taking it
should not affect your ability to
have children later. However, some

women may experience a short per-
iod of readj ustment after discontin-
uing the Pill. Even so, they usually
become pregnant soon.

Some women wonder if their
bodies need an occasional rest
from the Pill. The simple truth is,
they don't. And switching to a less
effective form of birth control
increases your chances for un-
planned pregnancy. So much for
giving your body a “rest?

You‘ve also probably heard that
there are risks associated with tak-
ing the Pill. That is a fact. And you
should know what those risks are.
For example, if you are taking the
Pill you should not smoke.
Especially if you are over 35.
Cigarette smoking is known
to increase the risk of serious
and possibly life-threatening
adverse effects on the heart
and blood vessels from Pill
use. What’s more, women
with certain conditions or
medical histories should not
use the Pill.

Even if you're already on
the Pill, you should see your
doctor at least once a year.

Decisions about birth con-
trol aren’t easy and shouldn't
be taken lightly. Moreover,
they should be based on
information from first-rate 
sources, not secondhand
advice. If you‘re a Pill user, p
read the patient information Se a
regularly. Learn everything you can
about what you’re taking.

Whether you’re considering get-
ting off the Pill or getting on it, the
better informed you are, the better
you‘ll feel about your decision.

And that's the truth.

Tuesday that officers seized a var-Q»

iety of animal parts including
genitalia from tigers and sea
lions, rhinoceros horns and dried
abalone.

Several hundred male sex or-
gans from other species were also
seized, said Chuck Monroe, a
California Department of Fish
and Game patrol chief at the
department's Yountville head-
quarters in Napa County.

The operation began as an in-
vestigation into illegal trafficking
in bear gall bladders, said
Monroe.

Most of the charges involve
poaching and commercialization
of wildlife, both misdemeanor
violations of the state Fish and
Game Code, he said.

Munroe said the animal parts
were marketed mostly to the A-
sian community as aphrodisiacs
and general health foods. In some
cases, he said, gall bladders from

cows or pigs were sold as bear 0-

organs.

. BAS needs people

for its elections

For the second consecutive year, the Black Action Society
has been confronted with problems arising from its elections.
Last year, a question of validity concerning those eligible to
vote arose, and 147 votes were disputed. The election was to
be reheld; then it was announced that the original results would
hold.

The BAS has worked long and hard to pick itself up off of
the ground after those incidents. Unfortunately, this year, the
election has been rescheduled, due to ineligibility of the ini-
tial two candidates because they submitted incomplete
”packets.”

It is discouraging not only to members of the Black Action
Society, we are sure, but should be to all members of the univer-
sity that such a viable, powerful resource for students lacks peo-
ple who are interested in leadership posi_tions.

As one of the largest, most important organizations on cam-
pus, the BAS is merely fulfilling its responsibility by reopening
the election. It is certain that there are students who are quali-
fied for the positions of chairperson and deputy chairperson
but who, for some reason or another, have not applied.

We encourage any student who is eligible to apply and run
for a BAS office. Now is your chance to improve things and
be directly involved in something you care about.

Shultz is hindered
by a large mouth

For the past week, Secretary of State George Shultz has been
touring the Middle East trying to drum up support for a revised
version of the 1979 Camp David accord.

Under the plan, Palestinians would receive land in the Gaza
strip and on the West Bank in return for an agreement to stop
rioting. Israel has refused to negotiate directly with the PLO,
which they suspect of playing a role in the current wave of Pales-
tinian riots.

Before he left for the Middle East, Shultz had high hopes for
progress between Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and
Egypt. So far, only Egypt has agreed to take part in the negotia-
tions, and King Hussien oflordan is said to be ”seriously con-
sidering" the proposal.

After remarks by President Reagan to the effect _that the riots
in the West Bank and Gaza strip were terrorist inspired, the
PLO instructed Palestinians invited to attend the negotiations
to stay away. To a person, they did.

Israel has consistently refused to negotiate directly with the
PLO, an attitude which has proved to be a serious stumbling
block in the negotiations. With the PLO obviously pulling the
strings on the side of the Palestinians, and Israel refusal to negoti-
ate with the PLO, the talks would seem to have reached an
impasse.

Before Shultz continues his efforts, perhaps it would be wise
for the administration to decide what its priorities are. If Rea-
gan feels that a declaration of suspected terrorist involvement
in the Palestinian riots is more important than the success of
the peace negotiations, he should keep his staff at home.

Q--

Home is where the heart is

In 1986, I decided I wanted to
write a few articles about the
homeless, in an attempt to show
what life is like for them.

Even as I type, I can look out
the window in the William Pitt
Union and see the bench at the
bus stop where I met Forbes that
October.

It was difficult for me to ap-
proach him. How would I know
for sure that he was homeless? I
studied his pockets —- they were
stuffed with food and napkins. I
asked him when the next bus was
coming, to see if he was waiting
for one.

He was sitting hunched over,
just enough to hide his wrinkled
face and chilly blue eyes. It was
sleeting outside, the first sign of
imminent bad weather I had seen
that fall.

I told him I wanted to write
some articles, and we agreed to
have coffee in the Union.

He told me about the days
when it was the Schenley Hotel
— where he used to bring the girl
he was engaged to for ballroom
dancing. That reminded him of
the William Penn Hotel, where
he said he saw Lawrence Welk
perform at the Chatterbox Inn.

”I had a lot of good times in my
life,” said Forbes.

Forbes told me he had been
homeless for a month — even
though he received Social Secu-
rity and two other pension
checks, which totaled about
$600 a month. He said it had
something to do with an alcohol
abuse problem he once had.

Forbes told me he thought he
was pretty lucky. ”My father and
mother built a house near Car-
negie Tech. I graduated from
Taylor-Allderdice, and because of
a football scholarship, I went to

Westminster.

’’l was a sergeant with the Ma-
rine Air Corps in World War II.
I hauled mail and supplies. I was
in the same outfit with Tyrone
Power.”

Forbes said he started drinking
after the war. ”I was at Vet's
Hospital three times. Alcohol had
control over my life.”

This was not the first time he
has been without a place to live.
"My mother died in I975. I lived
with her until then. When she
die(l, I got ever worse [his alco-
hol abusel."

He said he spent about five
months in a Salvation Army
shelter, where they found him a
job. From there he moved to a
hotel in East Liberty where he
lived for five years until it was
sold. After living in an apartment
for a short period of time, he
stayed at a shelter in East Liberty.

"I'm not doing much of any-
thing. I play the numbers on the
lottery. I just missed it the other
day.”

I look out my window now,
and remember him. It is true that
home is where the heart is. I can
only hope that Forbes has found
a place to keep his heart.

Will Young explain himself?

It seems that the New Student
Network for Social Change, Stu-
dents Against Apartheid, as well
as anyone with a concern for the
homeless owes William Young
an apology for forcing him to
look at, and yes, even walk by the
shanty erected as a reminder of
the failure of our society to care
for its own. Mr. Young does not
seem to quite grasp the fact that
the homeless do not want his
pity. Perhaps compassion and a
slight committment to them
would be more beneficial.

Mr. Young's assertion that all
the homeless require to totally
resurrect their lives is a job is
reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's
ability to reduce complex
problems to a simplistic catch-
phrase. This is useful for gaining
unthinking support, but not for
much else.

Finally, the irony in Mr.
Young's last point was apparent-

LETTERS

Iy lost on him, as part of the
problem with the homeless is that
they are not staying alive. People
are dying on the street, and Wil-
Iiam Young is wondering why
they're ”Ioafing” around. This
type of thinking is characteristic
of those who actually believe that
a cure—aII exists for this, a nation-
al tragedy.

Bret Dohner
CAS

William Young took the easy
way out. Nationally, 250,000 to
3 million people are estimated to
be homeless. This is a very real
problem, and it deserves to be ad-
dressed with the facts. Instead,
Mr. Young wrote an article, ”Are
the homeless the problem?” [Feb.

24] based on naive generali-
zations.

It was easy for Mr. Young to
categorize the homeless as lazy
garbage-pickers. I believe he was
referring to the ’’long-term’' street
people, many affected by alco-
holism or mental illness. These
are only a portion of the home-
less people. The ”transitionaIIy
homeless" include adolescent
runaways and the newly unem-
ployed. I am sure that Mr. Young
would be surprised to learn that

_ 22 percent of the homeless do, in

fact, work or attend college full-
time, but simply cannot afford the
increasing cost of living. Others
who are homeless are those in-
dividuals or families who ex-
perience domestic problems,
such as spouse beatings, and are
forced to leave home for tem-
porary periods.

Mr. Young's response was typi-

cal. Sure, there are jobs available.
Under the Reagan administration,
millions of new jobs have been
created. Obviously, Mr. Young
was unaware that more than half
of these jobs pay less than $7,000
per year. The minimum income
needed for a family of four to sur-
vive is $ll,200. However, the
minimum wage, which has not
been raised since 1981, remains
set at $3.35 an hour. As inflation
continues, the real value of the
minimum wage has already
decreased by more than 25
percent.

Of course, this issue of home-

lessness is a controversial one,
and unfortunately, some people
do share William Young's opin-

ions. I am just so surprised that
he admits his superior attitude
toward other human beings so
enthusiastically and openly.

William Young's view of the

”homeless” issue. How such at

sane and logical perspective end-
ed up in The Pitt News is some-
thing we don't fully understand.
Instead of being one of the
”bleeding-heart” liberals usually
‘associated with The Pitt News,
Mr. Young comes across as a
more conservative, intelligent,
well-informed observer. His ideas
about how to deal with the
homeless situation are right on

target. We, along with all Ameri—"

cans, sympathize with the plight
of the homeless. However,
government handouts and tem-
porary housing, while being
short-term answers, are not the
best solutions.

We, being Americans who care
about what happens to our fellow
man, would like to see the home-
less become productive members
of society. Of course, we realize
that there are those who are ill or
handicapped and are not able to

hold regular jobs. However, the Q.

majority of the homeless do not
fall into this category.

By having the government sup-
port them, we, in a way, promote
their current situation. Who, in
their right mind, feels motivated
to get a job when they know they
can survive without one,
however shabbily? By forcing the
homeless to seek employment,
we help them retain their dignity
and feelings of self-worth, as well
as improve their economic status.

I'm sure many see our view as
simplistic and insensitive. We, on
the other hand, see the shanty
displayed on the Cathedral lawn
as a naive, self-serving symbol of
misguided youths. While we are
sure the people involved with the
shanty are caring people, they are
not solving the problem. Unless
this problem is dealt with logical-
ly and quickly, it will not go
away. it will grow.

Is anybody out there?

Recently, there has been some
opposition to the Student
Government Board's decision to
ask the university to accept ”sex-
ual orientation” as one of their
policies to protect against dis-
crimination.

The fact that the SGB is being
presented with opposing views is
not disturbing. That it took six
weeks for someone to oppose the
phrase is. The Pitt News and 5GB
have done an admirable job of
keeping the issue in the public
eye. However, there were no dis-
senting voices until after the 5GB
took action.

The point is, why wait so long?
Why wait at all? Each Board
member maintains 10 office
hours per week. If you have a
problem, either call or visit the
office. Sometimes, we acquire
tunnel vision working on projects
and overlook a problem that is af-
fecting students. The SGB is try-
ing to improve the quality of life
for all students. With only nine

group to draw information from.
SGB needs to hear from the

Swim team places fifth at championships

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

After winning their sixth con-
secutive Big East title two
weekends ago, the women's
swim team took its act on the
road for some much stiffer" com-
petition.

When they walked away from
the Easterns competition, which
was held at Harvard over the
weekend, they came away with
a fifth-place finish out of 28
teams.

”Overall, we had good perfor-
mances. Actually, we did better
than it may appear -- fifth place

-— especially after winning the
Big East,” said Coach David
Belowich.

Although Belowich was
pleased with the outcome, he
seemed particularly pleased with
Marian Cassidy. ”Marian had
three lifetime bests at the meet.
She got her bests in the 400-yard
individual medley, the 500-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard back-
stroke.

”What was really great was that
she placed in the top eight in all
three,” Belowich added.

Among the other women who
placed in the meet include There-
sa Picklo, who placed fifth in

both the 500- and 1650-yard
freestyle. Diver Tricia Ney
finished second in the 3-meter
competition and sixth in the
1-meter.

Celeste Makiel placed seventh
in the 200-yard freestyle.

Makiel was also part of the fifth-
place 200-yard freestyle relay.
She was joined by Cindy Rose,
Laure Walczak and Tricia Rickert.

Rose was also a member of the
200-yard medley relay which
finished sixth. She was joined by
Sandy Albright, losette Prosser
and Judy Haughton.

Makiel, Cassidy, Rickert and
Picklo also took part in the

Seniors Charles Smith and Demetreus Gore will play their final home game tonight.

800-yard freestyle relay. The re-
lay team placed fourth, but
finished less than one second off
the school record.

”What’s nice about the whole
championship aspect of the sea-
son is that we had so many life-
time performances,” said
Belowich, referring to the Big East
and Eastern Invitationals. ”We
had 20 lifetime performances and
23 seasonal bests in the two
championships.

”What it means is that every-
body on the team had a lifetime
best, and that's what you strive
for. You just go out and do the
best you can,” Belowich added.

As for the season, Belowich
feels that ’’overall, it was a good
year. it was nice to win the Big
East, and we got good and better
competition at Easterns. It indi-
cates progress. Our freshmen -
it was good for them to see where
Eastern swimming is going, and
[they] performed well.”

For Albright, her season will
continue March 17 through 19.
She qualified for NCAAs in the
100-yard backstroke. ’

Two divers, Ney and Margie
Paulick will compete next week
in pre-qualifiers. Both still have a
chance to make the NCAA finals
to be held in Austin, Texas.

Smith and Gore bring
in a new Pitt era, exit
with lasting memories

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

The Big East and NCAA Tour-
naments are right around the
corner, and the 1987-88 Panther
basketball season is nearing its
end. More importantly, or
perhaps more sadly, so are the
careers of two of Pitt's most
renowned players, seniors
Charles Smith and Demetreus
Gore.

Smith and Gore will play their
final home game at Fitzgerald
Field House tonight against the
Seton Hall Pirates.

But Smith and Gore will leave
Pitt with a sense of accomplish-
ment. They began a period of
basketball at Pitt which has seen
the program go from relative ob-
scurity to national prominence
and recognition.

”Along with Charles, we start-
ed an era, and brought Pitt back
to respectability,” Core said.

Panther coach Paul Evans is
responsible for directing the Pitt
squad to the top twenty for the se-
cond consecutive year, but form-
er Pitt coach Dr. Roy Chipman
can take some pride in Smith and
Gore's accomplishments.

Chipman is the one who
signed Smith and Gore in 1984,
after they were named Mr.
Basketball in the states of Con-
necticut and Michigan, respec-
tively.

Rising Pirates bring talent to Fiel

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Who's the hottest team in the
Big East these days?

Syracuse? Yeah, but they’re al-
ways a top-notch ballclub. No
real surprise when those guys do
well. The Orangemen have been
pushing around the Big East for
years.

Pittsburgh? True, the current
Big East leader has a nifty 11-3
league record, and, if it can top-
ple Syracuse in the Carrier Dome
this Sunday, Pitt will gain at least
a tie for the regular season title.
But then again, everyone and his
big brother figured that the Pitt

Panthers would do well this
season.

So it seems that the real ques-
tion is, ”Who is the hottest Big
East squad that nobody expected
to hear from this deep into the
trenches?”

Simply, Seton Hall.

Tonight, the rapidly improving
Pirates invade the unfriendly con-
fines of Fitzgerald Field House for
a crucial conference matchup
with the Panthers.

Seton Hall historically has not
enjoyed much success against
Pitt, winning only three of the 13
overall meetings. Also, the Pan-
thers are currently enjoying a
14-game winning streak in Fitz-

gerald. But considering the way
the Pirates have been playing as
of late, that trend could change
a bit.

It's 1988, and suddenly gone
are the days when the Hall would
fall to basically anyone at all.

At an unusual 19-10, the
Pirates are assured of their second
consecutive winning season, only
their second one since 1979-80,
when CBS and ESPN college
basketball analyst Bill Raftery was
the coach at the South Orange,
N.J., school.

Since head coach P.J Carlesimo
joined the program six years ago,
the Pirates have continuously im-
proved their output of yearly wins

from six to nine to 10 to 14 to 15,
and now this season, 19 and
counting.

Last year, the Pirates finished
15-14, but struggled through con-
ference play, finishing 4-12. Still,
the Seton Hall faithful had reason
for hope, as out of those four con-
ference wins, two surprisingly
came against highly-touted
Georgetown, the eventual Big
East tournament champion.

And the Hall's average margin
of loss within the conference: 5.8
points. In other words, wood
borers hadn't exactly been
munching on the hulls of the
Pirates’ ships along the way -
Carlesimo had some unpolished

”There was no question they
would both be outstanding play-
ers,” Chipman said from Edwin
Bell Containers, where he is vice
president.

”We signed Smith because we
hadn't had a big kid who could
be competitive in the Big East,"
Chipman said. "Core was a good
sized guard and an explosive
scorer. They both suited needs.”

[1 [fl Cl

Chipman resigned in Decem-
ber 1985, Smith and Gore's
sophomore year. He continued to
coach Pitt for the remainder of
the season. The Panthers lost to
Southwest Missouri State in the
NIT, finishing with a mediocre
15-14 record. The Pitt program
was in disarray. No one could un-
derstand how a team with four
high school all-americans (Smith,
Gore, Curtis Aiken and Jerome
Lane) could lose 14 games, 11 in
the Big East.

But through all the early trou-
bles they’ve experienced, Smith
and Gore have had successful
careers. And when Evans took
over as coach, the team started to
flourish.

Statistics can often lie, but in
Smith's case, there's no doubt
No. 32 has left his mark on the
college game.

Monday night against Boston
College, Smith, a 6-foot-10

potential to work with.

Seton Hall wound up the year
with an NIT bid, its first post-
season birth in 10 years, but the
team quickly bowed out of the
tournament in the first round, los-
ing 74-65 to Niagara.

Early on in 1982-88, it was
once again Miss-Fortune and not
Lady Luck as the damsel inviting
Seton Hall in for a drink and a
rubdown. As late as Feb. 2, the
Pirates barely had their heads
above water with a 13-9 record.

With one of the tougher parts
of the schedule coming up, post-
season action, even a repeat bid
in the NIT didn't appear to be an

time scorer (1,916) and rebound-
er (940) in Pitt history. He also
became the Big East leader in free
throw attempts with 434.
Smith is also Pitt's a|l—time lead-
er in blocked shots with 327.
”Overall [my career was] a suc-
cessful one,” Smith said. ”A lot
of players would love to have the
career I've had.”

Gore has not been as consistent
as Smith, but has always been
regarded as an offensive threat.

The 6-5‘/2 Gore led Pitt in scor-
ing and free throw shooting as a
sophomore, averaging 16 points
per game and shooting 83.7 per-
cent from the line. But Gore
suffered through a slump in his
junior season trying to learn
Evans’ system.

Expectations ran high for Gore
this year, but an ankle injury kept
him from reaching his potential.

’’I think [my career] was up and
down, but for the most part
productive,” Gore said.

Productive and memorable.
Gore is the consummate offen-
sive innovator on the court, spin-
ning off picks and driving the lane
with unmatched creativity.

Gore is seventh on the all-time
Pitt scoring list with 1,459 points
and has started 92 consecutive
games.

ty to create situations on the floor
[are his greatest attributes]/’ Chip-

Oh, What A Taste!

Detroit agrees. ”He’s a great ath-
lete. He can adjust very well to
conditions out on the floor.’’

Smith, though not as creative as
Gore, has become well known

‘for his all-around game and team
attitude. ”He’s got a very well-
rounded game. He's not a ball
hog,” Chipman said. ”But his
greatest attribute is his versatility.
He can do a lot of things very
well.”

There seems to be one person
not quite satisfied with Smith's
performance, however, and that
is Charles Bentley, Smith's coach
at Warren G. Harding High
School in Bridgeport.

Asked how far he thought
Smith would take his game, Bent-
ley replied, ”farther.

”But, he's a good player and a
good kid. He had a lot of desire.
I think his attitude is his greatest
trait — he does the things he has
to do to win.”

D E] [T

Smith isn't overwhelmed with
his success, though. He said his
”greatest moments came off the
floor.” But as far as his most
memorable basketball ex-
perience, Smith said it was play-
ing against Florida on CBS Jan. 2
when he scored 30 points to lead
Pitt to an 80-68 win. ”Everybody
finally realized I could shoot the
jump shot. I was the only one
who knew I could do that before
then.”

Gore still remembers his first
game at Pitt. Who wouldn't?
Coming off the bench early in the
first half of the season-opener
against St. Francis, Gore proceed-
ed to come up with three steals,
and three subsequent rim-rattling
dunks in a matter of minutes.

There's little doubt Smith and
Gore will be sorely missed by
both teammates and Panther fans.
They've been the cornerstones of
a Pitt program that was hardly
first-rate their freshman year. Both
players could have gone else-
where. Many expected Smith to
end up at Villanova. Many
thought Core would wind up at
UCLA.

”They’re gifted athletes and
very likeable and enjoyable peo-
ple," Pitt assistant coach Norm
Law said. ”Even if they weren't
players, I'd want them as
friends.”

And what will Smith and Gore
miss most after college?

”I think I'll miss the friends I've

Smith and Gore are excited
about the senior night matchup.
The Pirates have come on strong
late in the season, winning six of
their past seven games, including
an 89-72 victory over Pitt last
Monday.

”I’m gonna try to downplay
[senior night] because I want to
win this game,” Gore said.

But asked if he would try to
bring his play up a notch for his
final home game, Core said,”|
think I will.”

Both player's families will be at
tonight's game, and Core, for
one, is glad. ”They understand
I'm leaving something I'm close

Continued from page 7
integral part of Carlesimo’s im-

mediate plans.

Since that date, the Hall has
ripped off six wins in its last seven
games, improving itself to a
respectable 7-7 in the ornery Big
East. The Pirates are currently in
sixth place in the league stand-
ings, but only one game behind
Georgetown and St. John's, who
are tied for fourth.

A week ago Monday, the Pan-
thers came snarling into the
Meadowlands Arena riding a
3—game winning streak that in-
cluded a hard fought 5-point vic-
tory over Georgetown. They
pussy-footed out of the place,

89-72 losers to the Pirates, the
worst Big East loss that Pitt has
ever suffered.

The main Panther poacher in
that contest was forward Mark
Bryant. The 6-foot-9 senior scored
a then career-high 32 points — 20
in the decisive second half -— and
pulled down 16 rebounds in the
Seton Hall victory.

Essentially, Bryant has been the
Pirates’ big gun throughout the
entire season, as he leads the
team in both scoring (20.9 ppg)
and rebounding (9.0 rpg). He re-
cently set a Big East single—game
scoring record by pouring in 38
points during the team's lopsid-
ed win over Villanova.
