Activities Group
Asks Resignation
Of Druid Leader

Point Scale Check-Up Results
In Removal Of Edwards,
Cheerleader Struble

Druid Oﬂice Unﬁlled

The inﬂuence of the men's point
scale committee was soundly felt in
the membership of Druids, national
sophomore activities fraternity, this
week, when the resignation of its
president. iFred Edwards, BA37, was
requested.

sEdwards tendered his resignation
as an officer at a special Druid meet-
ing Monday afternoon

A request for the resignation of J
Edison Strublc, C36, as a varsity
cheerleader was also made by the
committee at its opening meeting
Saturday morning.

Although the constitution of Druids
states that in the absence — either
temporary or permanent—of the presi-
dent, the vice president shall assume
that office, the vacant executive po
sition was not to have been ﬁlled un-
til a dinner meeting of the group last
night.

In the meantime, Gordon Rauck,
C37, was appointed temporary chair-
man Monday. Dale Van Ormer,
C37, has been the vice president of
the group, but an explanation was not
forthcoming from Druids as to why
the automatic step-up in office had not
been accomplished at the time of Ed-
wards’ resignation.

Scholastic difficulties. which have
clgpped the heavy hand of frustration
on many outstanding campus person-
alities during the last few weeks, con-
stituted the reason for the action
against Edwards and Struble.

The point scale committee, com-
posed of faculty members
investigates the records of all men
serving in activities and acts against
all students who have not passed 12
credits the previous semester or who
are not carrying 12 credits currently.

This group includes: Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfcar, dean of men and chair-
man of the committee; ,_Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant dean of men; Dr.
Omar C. lH‘eld, personnel director and
assistant dean of the -College; C. L.
Van -Sickle, assistant professor of ac-
counting; William E. Briiiker, in~
structor of chemical engineering;
Theodore A_ Siedle, assistant to the
dean of the School of Education; and
N. Robert Seidle, secretary of the
committee and assistant to the dean
of men.

Though forcing Edwards to relin-
quish his prominent position in Druids,
the committee acquiesced to his con-
tinued activity as a member of that
organization, of Pitt Riﬂes, and as
a member of the varsity cheerleading
squad.

It was announced by Mr. Seidle that
the committee will shortly issue a re-
vised scale of activity points, All
men are prohibited from carrying more
than too such points in extra-curricw
lar a.ctivities unless they have pro-
cured the special permission of the
committee. A close check-up will be
maintained by Mr. Seidle and the
committee. and the rules of the group
will be rigidly enforced, he declared.

   

 

Report On Rayon Analysis
To Be Given Thu rs day

A scientiﬁc report on the use of
rayon fabrics by Pittsburgh women
will be given ‘Thursday, -October 18,
jointly b_v D_r_ David R._ Craig, direc-
tor of the Research Bureau of Retail
Training, and Dr, Paul F. Lazarsfold
of Vienna. The data and information
on which the study is based was col-
lected largely by undergraduate wo-
men of the University.

The report, entitled, “Measure-
ments of the acceptance and rejec-
tion of rayon fabrics by Pittsburg‘-1
women,” will be delivered before the
Rayon Fabrics subcommittee of the
committee on textiles of the Ameri-

The study shows the attitudes of the
persons interviewed, and attempts to
explain those attitudes by analyzing
the age, marital status, income, living
and social status of those who favor
rayon as compared with those who
do not.

§Regis Toomey, Former Cap-Gowner,

Comes Back To Watch Panthers Win

By Ron

Idol worshippers, autograph seekers, and those who were just
plain curious milled around a certain box in front of a student sec-
tion at Saturday’s Southern California game, and inflicted them-
selves on one of the University’s most prominent alumni.

He stood it like a true gentleman; he autographed calling cards,
programs, tickets, memo books, in fact, anything that was pushed
in his direct.ion—one erstwhile athlete even getting the famous sig-

 

The. name on those souvenirs was
found to be Regis Toomey, ’21_

For your years at the University,
Toomey constituted one ofthe main-
stays of the annual Cap and Gown
show, managed the baseball team (we
had one then), managed the grid
squad -one year, sang the sweetheart
song of Sigma Chi, became a fast
friend of the good Doctor Sutherland
(and of the track coach too—Toomey
ran the 220 and 440 yard dashes on
the varsity), and garnered himself a
college education.

After writhing with his alma
mater’s team through two smashing
New Year’s day defeats from South-
ern Cal on the coast, Toomey “could
not be stopped” according to his man-
ager, “from rushing to see the tables
turned.” He saw it, and, after the
game, was among the ﬁrst to rush. to
Jock’s side in the Panther dressing
room and offer the old congrats.

A News reporter was fortunate
enough to squeeze through the melee
surrounding Toomey long enough to
ask a few questions.

“Did you ﬁnd that your experiences
in Cap and Gown were useful when

nature on an athletic eligibility card.¢

you broke into the movies?” he was
asked,

“Sure, sure lots . . say what you
like in your story mister and it’ll be
ﬁne with me. Sure lay it on thick

. I got a great deal out of those
four years.

“I worked out under Doc Ashbrook,
you know, and trouped with Gus
Schnabel, Lou Fushan, Ben Levant,
and others who are still carrying on
with the organization."

Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, professor in the
School of Dentistry is now president
of the graduate ‘Cap and Gown club
and wrote the book for “All to the
Point’-’ two years ago. Schnabel,
Fushan, and Levant are still writing
tunes for the annual all-male musical
productions.

Toomey is now under contract with
RKO. He declared that “Alibi,” re-
leased last year, was his favorite pic-
ture. '

urday.

EW. Prendergast
Addresses Forum

Sun-Telegraph Writer Discusses
Candidates For Election

Refusing to commit himself on the
coming election, E. W. Prendergast,
former University student and poli-
tical writer for the Pittsburgh Sun-
Telegraph, comes here today to de-
scribe the issues and candidates to
the Inquiry forum, , ‘,,_

The address to the forum, which
will be at 12:30 o'clock in Room 107,
Alumni Hall, is the ﬁrst of a series
of three which will include political
leaders of both parties.

Prendergast would not discuss the
alleged “corruption” of candidates in
both parties, saying voters should
“try again” if they fail to choose
“honest” men next month.

Katherine M.onori, C36, and Roger
Hanson, C36, co-chairmen of Inquiry
announced today that Harry A, Estep
and Henry Ellenbogen, political lead-
ers, will present Republican and Dem-
ocratic viewpoints in following forums.

Sales Exipierience
First Requisite
In Job Hunt

“Sales experience is a primary re-
quisite in obtaining positions in al-
most all lines of business administra-
tion,” says J. C. Barton, director of
the University Placement bureau.

Commenting on a statement made
by Lawrence W. Zimmer, director of
the New York university Bureau of
Employment, who said that a knowl-
edge of stenograpny was one of the
most important necessities for col-
lege graduates who desire positions,
Mr. Barton said that before a position-
seeker could display his knowledge of
stenography he would have to sell his
abilities to the interviewing execu-
tive. ‘

“A knowledge of salesmanship has
often enabled a poorly trained person
to get a good position over a better
trained rival,” said Mr. Barton, citing
individual examples. “Such experi-
ence is invaluable and every gradu-
ate, no matter what ﬁeld he is in,
should get some sales experience in
order to meet the public and present
himself in the most favorable light."

 

Silence. No, not “Lights out” at a
Tech dorm, just the third day of fra-
ternity silence period. Rushees are
wondering where all their so-called
rushing friends are. All the fellows
that treated them so royally last week
have gone to the mountains or some-
thing. VVhen you do see one of them.
he doesn’t even speak to you. Res-
taurants in Oakland are getting back
their trade. Rushees are buying their
own meals for a change. Dances,
smokers, and stags are “out” until
another rushing season in February.

“W'hat’s it all about?" freshmen ask,
Last week they were kingpins; now
they’re just the dust on the alley-
Big shots last week; now small fry.
Why the sudden change?

Rushees will have to suffer until
tomorrow at 5 o’clock. Then silence
period is oﬂicially over, and fraterni-

Thief Enters Y
Hut Late Sunday

Candy, Checkers Taken; Broken
Window Used For Entrance

A checker-playing ﬁend with a
sweet tooth entered the Y hut late
Sunday night and made away with two
sets of checkers and a quantity of
candy.

The thief evidently tried to pry
the window o,p_ei_1_, and failing, broke
the glass. (He entered the office and
found the checkers and the candy.

Miss Mary Deinpster, Y office sec-
retary, after checking over the candy"
counter estimated the loss at about
$10. W. W. Mendenhall stated that

the checkers and the candy were the
only things that seemed to have been
touched by the burglar.

The theft was not discovered until
Monday morning when ‘Mr, Menden-
hall opened up the hut, which had
been closed since Saturday afternoon.
Maintenance men r'e_plac_ed the broken
glass this morning.

   

Kronenwetter Delegate
To Journalism Conclave

The University chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi will have delegates at the
silver anniversary convention of the
national professional journalism fra-

drivers, according to chapter oﬂicials.
At present, plans have not been re-
vealed, but the “conventionites
leave tomorrow morning for the con-
clave at De Pauw university, Green-
castle, Indiana.

Wilbur Clark, C35, president of the
local chapter, was elected oﬂicial
delegate and O-mer E. Kronenwetter,
C35, alternate at a meeting two weeks
ago, The trip was to be made on
Clark’s motorcycle, but Clark and the
machine were both put beyond reach

as delegate, will make the trip in
company with an alternate not yet
chosen.

Fraternity men were suddenly

serious and vital thinking was done.
Bids were sent in “to the office” and

of the variety and abundance of rush-

Students Pacify
Riot Urge With
Quiet Parade

Many a wild “Alleganee-geiiac
genac” split the welkin on Monday
morning as approximately 75 auto-
mobiles carried between 500 and 1,000
triumphant students in the almost an-
nual victory parade.

“The Wild Boys (a.nd girls) of the
Road” were organized at 9:30 o'clock,
and, under a. convoy of eight mounted
policemen, began the most orderl.y
riot in history by grinding and tooting
up the University drive. When all
the would be “whooper-uppers” were in
line, the cavalcade made for the down-
town district, smugly hooting all out-
siders trying to cut in on the parade,
since the patrolmen stopped all side
traffic and granted right-of-way
through traffic lights.

Down Fifth and Sixth, over Liberty
and up the Boulevard of the Allies,
the rioters were led by the amiable
arm of the law. Before the celebra-
ters knew it, however, they were in
the entrance to Schenley Park, and
festivities were abruptly terminated
by the same minions of justice who
had led them to believe that for once
there was going to be a really riotous
riot. Running-board riders were drop-
ped, cars were released one by one,
and the students straggled toward the
campus. And another Pitt victory
riot bit the dust.

Sportafeather Sales
Aid Needy Students

Birds of a feather ﬂock together!
Over 40 student salesmen shouted
this over the campus Saturday as they
successfully inaugurated the Pitt
“Sportafeather.” Jack Hill, former
Panther artist, conceived the idea,
copyrighted it, and with the backing
of D, A. Eneix, BA22, and V. E, Riva,
L33, is carrying on his drive through
the University employment bureau for
the beneﬁt of unemployed students.

Similar novelties have been popular
on the campuses of Princeton, Yale,
Harvard, and Colgate, but to Pitt goes
the distinction of having the ﬁrst wa-
terproof painted feather.

Dr. McCabe To Address

“National obstacles to recovery”
will be the subject of an address to
be given by Dr. George K. McCabe,
assistant professor of economics, at a
meeting of Alpha Kappa Psi, profes-
sional commerce fraternity, in the
Fort Pitt hotel, Monday evening.

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of

First Assembly
Meet Scheduled
Tuesday Night

Dr. Bowman Invites University
Governing Body To Dinner
Session At Club

40 Members To Attend

The 40 members of the University
Assembly, campus governing body,
will be the guests of the Chancellor
of the University, Dr. John G. Bow-
man, at the initial meeting of the
group next Tuesday night.

Included in the invitation list will
be the 30 students and ten faculty
members who were either elected or
appointed to the group since its in-
ception last spring.

The meeting, orginally scheduled
for last night, was postponed for a
week to make the Chancellor's
presence possible. It will be in the
form ofia dinner meeting at the Uni-
versity club.

The general assembly has not met
since it organized in May and elected
ﬁve student members to the executive
committee. This group, augmented
by Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, Miss Tliyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, and Theodore W, Biddle, as-
sistant dean of men, has acted for
the Assembly on all matters which
have come up for consideration so far
this semester.

It was thought possible by Mr.
Biddle that the vacancy in the execu-
tive body caused by the resignation
of the former president, King Derr,
C35, either would be ﬁlled by the
Assembly Tuesday or a method of
naming another member would be
suggested at the meeting.

The position left open in the larger
body was awarded to Marion Epping,
C35, by the executive group in ac-
cordance with the constitution.

Leonard Marks, C35, former vice-
preside-nt of the Assembly, stepped in-
to the presidency last month. Marks
has been prominent in undergraduate
activities on campus, having been a
member of the editorial board of the
Pitt Panther, of Pi Sigma Alpha, na-
tional honorary political science fra-
ternity, and of Pi Tau Phi, honorary
scholastic fraternity.

“ Use. Not Proﬁt”

INCE IT IS FAIRLY commonplace to see the
NRA assailed in the daily pressby clergymen
who resent the New Deal ’s restrictions of industry
or who are shocked by the private emotions of the
younger Roosevelts, it is all the more surprising
to read the prediction of the Very Reverend John
W. Day, dean of Grace Cathedral of Topeka, Kan-
sas, that the NRA will fail “because it seeks to
preserve the proﬁt motive.”

Mr. Day told a group of 1,000 young men and
women attending a mass meeting of the general
convention of the Protestant Episcopal church that
the “present administration, although moving
slowly to the left, is still dedicated to the preser-
vation of capitalism and all that it means in inter-
national warfare, race hatreds, sweatshops and
economic slavery generally.”

Dr. Day advocated a new economic system
“based upon use instead of proﬁt,” with pub-
lic utilities, including railroads, under public
ownership . War is inevitable, he said, until cap-
italism is replaced by a socialized economic system.

As measures to promote world peace Dr. Day
urged youth to refuse to bear arms in aggressive
warfare, the clergy to stop recruiting from their
pulpits in time of war and the American legion to
work for a war-time draft of all wealth as well as
men. The proﬁt system inscparably links the man-
ufacturer of armaments to int.erna.tional politics,
according to Dr. Day, who said that, althougli
progress toward peace has been, achieved by dis-
armament and arbitration projects, neither gov-
ernment ownership of munitions industries nor dis-
armament will bring peace.

All that Dr. Day asserts has been asserted be-
fore. It was all said ten years ago by Norman
Thomas, who was once a clergyman himself, as the
American Communist pa.rty is fond of reminding
him. The interest of Dr. Day’s address is that it
helps further to deﬁne the tendency of the con-
temporary Church to undertake a political and so-
cial mission.

The alignment of Dr. Day, and of strong groups
in his own and other denominations, with move-
ments toward peace and social justice through a
revised economic order remind one of how seldom,
historically the Church has allowed social revolu-
tions to be made without it. - ~~

Dr. Day concluded with a dejectedpicture of
American youth as a force. in the social develop-
ment of the country. They have permitted them-
selves to be “lulled into a peaceful dream of eco-
nomic conceit by political leaders, preachers and
general uplift men,” ‘he said. ,

“The future of— the countryidoes not depend
upon what the young people are thinking and do-
ing today,” he added. “As a group they are do-
mg very little thinking.”

It is no “peaceful dream of economic conceit”
that preacher Dr. Day has to diffuse.

 

 

Rest For The Cheering Section

T IS PATHETIC to observe how a sincere undergrad-
uate elation, such as the one following the Panthers’

surprising victory over Notre Dame two seasons ago, can
become Monday’s conventional stereotype of the football
holiday.

Logically a Monday demonstration might be the end-
product of patriotic exhilaration over the forty-odd hours
since the end of a Saturday game. But Monday’s gen-
teel riot was a very much delayed response. The grins
were false and the cheers falsetto.

About the same time that the cheering section re-
turned from its conducted tour of the big city, won-
dering what to do with the rest of the holiday, the foot-
ball squad was at work on the practice ﬁeld, wondering
What to do with M-ninesota. The Panthers didn't get a

Concerning The Passing
Of The Dirge Chanters

By Herrymon Maurer

HE LITERARY MAGAZINE Story presented an en-

lightening advertisement to the readers of the last
issue of the New Republic. The advertisement strikes
out boldly with destructive and ﬁnancial intent. “The
cries of those passionate Americans. who, since the
W'orld “Var, have vociferated so long and loudly that to
be literature, ﬁction must ﬁrst last and always be ‘stark
realism,’ have faded away at least to a hollow echo . . .
After 1929 the reading public was gradually drawn away
from ‘stark realist’ ﬁction by the superior starkness and
reality of depression facts, ﬁgures, privations, and dis-
asters. And now a third phase is under way. The pub-
he has been over-starked.” People are “turning for com-
fort and stimulation to Story-—the only short story mag-
azine of high literary merit now published in America.
If you have been ‘over-starked,’ read Story. Regularly
it costs $4 a year by subscription. But you can obtain
it just now at the special acquaintance price of only $1
for ﬁve months.”

Think of it, my friends, under one single tent we
have collected all there is of comfort, stimulation, _and
merit in the United States. Usually the admission fee
is $4 but now in order to present the excellence of our
collection to our many friends you may enter at the
“special acquaintance price of only $1.” That guy across
the street? He’s no good; he’s a “stark realist.”

There is, however, in this advertisement of the edi-

‘ torial policy of Story more than a pleasantly pointed an-

nouncement of the death of realism and a cultivated ap-
peal to join the new religion. This is an announcement
that more boats have been added to the South Sea Steam-
ship line and that more ivory towers are being built, or
rented, than in any period in past history.

The effect of this news is interesting, but is should
not be astounding. Realism has so many component

"factors and it itself appears in so many forms that it is

not difficult to point out how literature has begun to
stop striking out blindly at Scylla and has ﬂoated off
quite close to Charybdis. Abroad there was, ﬁrst of all,
the pure product of the Russian writers, some of the
English, Balzac. Zola, and Ibsen. As the social scene
which these writers observed became more and more
disheartening, the new writers began to pull the bed-
clothes over their heads. The bed-clothes were all
ready; they had been woven by Baudelaire and Mal-
larme. Once an author had retched over the outside
world, he could cover his head, announce himself a Sym-
bolist, proceed to analyze himself, his friends, and be
profoundly unhappy.

HIS SYMBOLIST POETRY a.nd ﬁction was in reality

the realism which communicated itself most violently
to its readers. The mere fact that literarymen after
one good look at the world should run off and hide, to-
gether with the fact that the reports of occasional
glimpses over the edge of the covers and continual gaz-
ings inside themselves were profoundly despairing, con-
tained enough ammunition within itself to reduce to the
horizontal all those who could yet stand.
more unpleasant to meet Va1ery’s M. Teste on a clear
day than a madman on a dark night. But here there
was no undiluted realism; aside from escaping under
the bed clothes, the symbolists also escaped into theory
and tried to redeem their souls with theories of art for
art’s sake, or intellect for intellect’s sake, or remem-
brance of things past. Then too, at the same time, there
was growing up the escape motive, in which one rushed
off with D. H. Lawrence to Mexico or with somebody else
to a dim and rose-colored past. »

In Europe after the war the wail of symbolism and
-the unconvincing shout of escape fused together into a
denioniacal shriek of D-adaism_ The shriek rose to an
insane, madly—oppressing pitch, and then annihilated
itself. After a. time attempts were made in Europe, only
half successful, to recreate realism if only in its sym-
bolistic guise. Escape, of course, which demands only
a distant country or an age removed continued as jollily
Denial of the past, and escape for the future
became the vogue. T. S. Eliot, essentially a French poet
though American born, announced after so much effec-
tive expression of futility that he could drink no more
of his own liquor and that he was going to embrace
“classicism in literature, royalism in politics, and angle-
catholicism in religion.” Wliereupon he explained that
his conception of this holy trinity was vague and that
the terms were without deﬁnition. The spinelessness of
Mr. Eliot in refusing to face his own conclusions made
upon many persons a more despairing and disillusioning
impression than had “The Hollow Men,” the supreme ex-
pression of impotence in which Eliot beat loudly on his
own chest and discovered it to be hollow.

This change in T. S. Eliot symbolizes the whole tran-
sition in the United States as in Europe, because in this
country ofﬁcial realism had started later and had begun
to decline after a short ife. American literature has not
had the intermediate stages of foreign literature, but
has stayed at the extremes of real realism or decided
escape. And escape, whether it be called romantic
amoral idealism or not, is beginning to have the higher
hand, In addition to the perennial Hergesheimers,
Bromﬁelds, and Cabels we now have the Anthony Ad-
verses-——a1id the magazine Story to which you may still
subscribe for the slight sum of one dollar.

There is perhaps only one way of revitalizing realism.
To revitalize one must ﬁght, and understand clearly
what one is ﬁghting. The object attacked may be the
novel of escape itself—see Edmund Wilson’s satiric story
“What to Do Till the Doctor Comes” in the July 11 issue
of the New Republic. It may be the social order which
the novelist believes must be destroyed, Andre Malraux’s
novel, “La Condition Huniaine," for instance. In all
events it is not necessary to fall into a complete and dis-
orderly rout. We can still “pray God and walk straight
forward.”

Editor, the Pitt News:

I wish to commend through you the author, Herrymon
Maurer, of the clinching, clear thinking article appear-
ing in Wednesday’s issue of the Pitt News entitled,
Orozco’s Dartmouth Murals. t is a. type of feature that
characterizes, every well-rounded and high ranking news-
paper; and to ﬁnd a literary composition of this type
in the Pitt News, proves conclusively that the News is
not just another, ordinary college news publication. May
we have intermittently a column—from your footnote it
is evident that we will-—similar to the one mentioned.

, So congratulations to Herrymon, and to the progressive

editor of the Pitt News.
LEO HOLLEIN.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I suggest that the Pitt News continue the 1ast—semester
policy of agitating for a course in Russian. At the close
of last semester, students who were hopeful that the
articles in the Pitt News would accomplish their pur-
pose were confronted at the last registration with the
excuse that the teacher whom the department hoped to
get was an unemployed engineer. If he were hired as
a teacher, it was feared that he would be recalled to his
real profession. Consequently, in the middle of the year
the language department would have a group of Rus-
sian students on its hands without a teacher. It was
further stated that due to the depression the department
was forced not to expand. Blame it on the depression!
The excuses are almost as good as the recent alibis we
heard during the losing of one of our best faculty mem-
bers. FRANK DIETRICH.

‘Wie Lustig Das Studentleben’

I ran across a good one, myself. After a
dinner at the fraternity house, and a dance at the College club, ten
couples meandered into a downtown liashadasliery, and were led
by the ina.nagement into one of the small rooms adjoining the dance
They were taking seats at a long table when a group of four

couples at another table recognized‘:

some of the Pitt students, and began
to sing at the top of their voices,
“Dear old Tech, Carnegie Tech . ”’
The party stopped and looked around,
then the twenty swung into “Hail to
Pitt . .” likewise as loud as they
could. The two songs do not harmon-
ize. The management came scowling
into the room.

“You’ll not be served until you are

perfectly quiet!” he stormed in a lull
after “Allegenac!” But as a school
teacher, he lacked technique, and
when he left the room both the Tech
and Pitt groups yelled, “Yeaa, Man-
agement!” The management scooted
back into the room. “You will have
to either be silent, or get out,” he
issued the ultimatum that had si-
lenced generations of rooters. He left
again, then a Pittite stood up and re-
marked in his most religious manner,
“Okay, let's go.” So the twenty Pitt
couples arose and trooped out. Car-
negie, not to desert their opponents,
likewise arose and marched out be-
hind. The management was sur-
prised, and pursued the fact that Car-
negie had ordered their food_ Despite
this, the whole gang left, with every-
one in the restaurant looking either
pained or amused. But it must be
emphasized, if only for the sake of
Carnegie’s reputation, that they left,
and were not requested to do so.

A half hour later, the Pitt group
met again at a neat little place in
East Liberty. They started to sing
some of the fraternity songs, while
everyone else in the restaurant ap-
plauded. Then, from an adjacent
room, came familiar strains of “Dear
old Tech, Carnegie Tech . . .” and it
seemed the Carnegie bunch had beat
them there. The duel continued,
while an orchestra vainly tried to get
started in between verses, but it was
only when the Alma Maters of both
schools had been sung and toasted
that the music (instrumental) began.

A little investigating disclosed that
the men of the Carnegie group were
members of Alpha Rho Chi, profes-
sional Architecture fraternity, and in-
cluded a couple of the Carnegie soph-
oniore class oﬂicers. The whole par-
ty, including the girls, claimed to be
architects and sophomores. The Pitts
hope that the Carnegie people en-
joyed the evening as much as they.

Dear Father:

IVAS LATE TO,,class again today,

for I was back to my favorite pas-
time of veneration. I arose early this
morning, and slipped out of my dorm
in Alumni hall before the other fel-
lows were stirring, and hiked around
the campus lot, watching the sunshine
creep down the side of the Cathedral
until it reached the spire on the
Chapel. By the time I was back, ﬁrst
breakfast was being served, and I al-
most missed it.

A Discussion Of

Acting, Voice---And Health

joyed both times.

Of course the plot is stale and the connection between the title
and the story too subtle to exist. But “One Night of Love” is a ﬁlm
that doesn’t have to bother about an original theme or a signiﬁcant

All this made me so late that when
I returned to the temple again the
halls were empty except for a few
persons studying in the Commons
room. The doors to the classrooms
were closed, and the corridor lights
dimmed, so that standing at one end
of the passage parelleling Fifth ave-
nue, I could look down to the far end.

The expression “Hallowed Halls”
came to my mind, and I understood
it for the ﬁrst time.

“Every frescoed wall,

Every hallowed hall,

Every soul, and all

That goes with life

Is better for its being in the

Cathedral,” was the theme of
the 1961 Owl, and I think it was
well chosen.

The corridors here on the classroom
ﬂoors are long, and so of course they
seem narrow in the perspective. The
ceilings are barreled in a round arc,
and would be like old Roman tunnels
but for the lunettes that cross regu-
larly overhead, and the columnettes
along the walls; as it is there is none
of the darkness and gloom of a per-
fect tunnel. On the ﬁrst ﬂoor the
walls are all of block stone. You
know, do you not, that every class-
room door is handcarved, and despite’
a set pattern in general, the details
are different and interesting. Name
anything splendid or famous, and it
is represented somewhere on a
C’athe.'.lral door, These doors are so
spaced along the passageways that
they, with their rounded lentels, bal-
ance the small arches that line the
inside wall, looking into the Com-
mons room. The result is a medieval
monastery cloister, and the effect is
the same, respectful and honorable.
No spirit but a noble one can be com-
fortable here. And so what do you
think will be the effect on an indi-
vidual’s morale and mind, after four
years of training in an atmosphere
such as this?

I hurried down the hall, passed the
Swedish, Chinese and Grecian rooms,
and slipped into my seat in 154, the
Scottish room, where I am studying
the Scottish Poets. Someday I’ll tell
you about this room.

Last night I was going, just at dusk,
to my instructor’s office, on the fourth
ﬂoor.

I walked along the third level;

corridor, which was unlit except for! '

the lights that gleamed through the
arches from the Commons room. It
was unusual to walk in light, like this,
when theceiling above was dark, and
the light reached only to my knees.
As I walked I could see only my legs
and feet moving. It was almost
eerie. It has been said that more can
be done by using the different light-
ing combinations than any stage can
accomplish with even the most mod-
ern equipment. But shadowed or il-
luminated, I shall never regret hav-
ing known the cloister-respect in

is quite enough.

Perhaps you suffer the common
delusion of individuals like myself,
who hear all their opera by radio,
that vocal virtuosi merely have to be
able to accomplish amazing things
with their voices, and that these sing-
ers don’t have to act and in most;
cases can’t act, Miss Moore, you will
discover, is a delightful exception.
She not only has a clear, smooth voice
rich in its lower tones, but she is an
excellent actress. She could main-
tain dramatic stardom if she could‘ no
longer warble a note.

The Flower Song from “Carmen”
was just a beautiful melody to me un-
til I saw and heard Grace Moore
heighten it to the exotic lure of a
Spanish siren_ In that short scene
she created a living character and
made you feel the embryo of tragedy
behind the jollity.

But one quality about the prima
donna impressed me even more than
her voice and her . dramatic talent.
Miss Moore radiates healthiness. And
that is a condition sadly lacking
among the lovely ladies of the screen
colony. Most Hollywood heroines
look either like starved consumptives
of the Constance Bennett fashion or
like the overstuffed bloaters of the
“c’mup and see me” variety. Personal-
1y I care neither for languid dietary
ascetics nor for the greasy voluptuar-
ies of the movies. With Miss Moore,
however, you watch a woman who
seems to go through a daily dozen of
quarts of milk, steaming mounds of
spinach, and twenty—mile hikes.

Miss Moore simply has the zest
for life, sparkling energy, “e1an vital”
or what have you, She communicates
vigor, spirit, enthusiasm. I haven’t
talked to a single person who saw
“One Night of Love” who hadn’t come
away without being imbued with some
of that pep.

A dairy farm, a carload of Popeye’s
strengthener, and a thousand miles of
Pennsylvania highway to Miss Grace
Moore for a lovely voice, ﬁne acting
ability, and health. And the greatest
of these is health,

All it has in it is Miss Moore¢

Citizens Of Minnesota
Go For Their Gophers

Minneapolis and St. Paul are a couple of towns up in the north-

ern state of Minnesota.

hey are located on opposite sides of the

Mississippi river and if there were no bridges across that river 110-
body in either town would mind it much.

In other words, these two hamlets have a feeling for each other
uhich would rival that which was a mutual set-up between Polly
Gann and Alice Longworth in their heyday. Never have they agreed

on anything. That is, not until now.¢

The towns are in perfect harmony on
one point, that being to the effect that
Minnesota has the best football team
in the country, or in the world; it
makes little difference.

The Minneapolis and St. Paul peo-
ple aren’t tossing any haphazard bou-
quets when they say that, either.
Their business is spelled f—l-o-u-r, not
the bouquet kind. Long before the
season opened, the authorities were
making ready to have Minnesotais
name engraved on the Big Ten foot-
ball trophy this year.

There was no reason in the world
why the authorities shouldn't do that.
Minnesota had not bowed to any team
on her list last fall, including our own
Panthers and with the exception of
Oen, a fairly decent center, the Goph-
ers had the whole blame ﬁrst team
back for another year. Then, just
when things began to look very nice
indeed, along came a couple of new
men who make last year’s regulars
look weak by comparison, All of which
would make any coach with a heart
less stout than Bernie Bierman’s take
down his hair for a good cry.

The only interesting thing the
Gophers have done so far this year
is to trample Nebraska, 20-0, This
same Nebraska outﬁt is reputed to be
strong enough in the backﬁeld but
rather green in the line. However,
the lads from Lincoln took over Iowa’s
outﬁt just last Saturday, 14-13 which
may go to prove that the Nebraskans
have something on the ball besides
the name “Cornhuskers.”

Minneapolis being considerably far
removed from Hollywood, the Gopher
men haven't been accused of some of
the ailments with which Southern
California's boys were said to be af-
flicted. Mr. Pug Lund and his mates
have also the beneﬁt of having two
weeks rest between the Nebraska and
Pitt games, which may mean some-
tli*l'.ig_ It’s hard to get away from the
conclusion that Saturday’s game at
the stadium will be some ball game.

Pitt could stand a victory over Min-
nesota. Not since 1931 have the
Panthers taken the measure of a Big
Ten team. A scoreless tie with Ohio
State in 1932 and last year’s loss at
Minneapolis have come after Iowa’s

Dr. H, C. Carlson's Varsity basketball
team spent most of their time in lini-

has limited the practice to tossing a
ball around, and going over old and
preliminary basketball fundamentals.

Practice that was to continue
through next week has been post-
poned a week because of the needed
repairs on the Stadium ﬂoor. After
the necessary repairs are completed

drills will be resumed for a week, fol-
lowing which the squad will take a
two-week rest. _

The squad, consisting of nineteen
men, are all in excellent physical con-

weeks diet of Doc Carlson’s hot choc-
olate and ice cream, be able to begin

their difficult twenty-three-game sched-'

Artiﬁcial Flashes
To Be Exhibited

Portable Lightning Generator
Featured In Display

 

Lightning in all its glory will flash
at the University Stadium tomorrow
when Vvestinghouse engineers exhibit
apparatus for the manufacture of arti-
ﬁcial ﬂashes. Engineering students
and any others who care to may at-
tend.

This exhibit, sponsored by the de-

partment of electrical engineering,
has been made possible by the use of
a portable lightning generator, along
with a modern cathode ray oscillo
graph, an instrument which can record
on a photographic ﬁlm or make visi-
ble on a ﬂuorescent screen electrical
charges of one one-hundredth of a
million of a second.
According to Mr, Howard S. Dyclie,
head of the department, these experi-
ments with artiﬁcial lightning mark
a long step forward from the time
when such natural phenomena were
regarded with terror and trepidity.

The exhibit at the Stadium tomor-
row is ihe aftermath of attempts
first made by engineers to measure
surges of lightning with their ﬁrst ele-
inentary instrument, the klydono-
graph. In 1927. Westinghoiise carried
out measurements of the phenomenon
with artiﬁcial lightning propagated
over an actual transmission line.

Thereafter investigations of light-
ning have been conducted all over the
United States, and valuable data has
been collected not only on the behav-
ior of lightning transients on elec
trical systems but of the character-
istics of the lightning discharges
themselves.

Jezebel’s fourth birthday, says l\'Il'.|

this week. “Of course,” continues‘
Mi'_ Dunkelberger, “it’s hard to set any
speciﬁc date _about Jezebel’s age,
since like most females she is an as-
sembled job.”

When she is really working and
making the correct buzzing ‘noise,
Jezebel can measure temperature
changes of one ten-millionth of a de-
gree. Eventually with her lielp Mr.
Dunl{1ebei‘gei' will write his doctor’s
dissertation on heats of dilution. In the
meantime, she is not ordinarily visible
to the layman, but Mr, Dunkleberger
may permit outsiders to see her if
they promise not to tickle her in the
ribs, poke her in the stomach, or
otherwise upset her,

There is no other machine exactly
like Jezebel in the world, a.ltl1ougli
there are a few somewhat similar ma-
chines in Munich.
