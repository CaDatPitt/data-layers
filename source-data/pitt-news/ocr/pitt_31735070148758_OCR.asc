Vice President Joe Biden will
visit the University of Pitts-
burgh Friday as part of his ef-
fort to push for the American
Jobs Act. /

Biden will give a speech in the
Connolly ‘Ballroom of Alumni
Hall at 11:45 a.m. According to

South Side about the importance
of having Congress pass the Act.
Two months ago, Obama pitched
hisjob creation proposal and in

V October, congressional Repub-

licans shot down the full $447
billion jobs package. A few days
later, they killed a piece of the
proposal that would forestall
layoffs of state and government
employees.

Student Government Board
President Molly Stieber will be
introducing Biden. She said that
Biden’s visit shows the Obama
administration’s interest in
large semi—public educational
institutions.

Occupy Pittsburgh protesters
wanted to march in solidarity with
California’s Occupy Oakland pro-
tests, so it’s only natural that they
marched in the Oakland neighbor-
hood Wednesday night.

More than 100 protesters, who
currently have a camp set up in Mel-
lon Green, met in Schenley Plaza
and began their march around
Oakland at 6:30 p.m. The protest,
which lasted for more than two
hours, was meant to support the
efforts of the protestors in Occupy
Oakland, whose camp was raided
by police last Tuesday.

Unlike the events in California,
the protest remained peaceful. One
person was taken into police cus-

The Occupy Pittsburgh movement, which normally camps Downtown, trekked to Oakland last night.

tody toward the end of the protest,
when protesters tried to enter an
event held by the Pitt student group
Students for Justice in Palestine.
Police initially denied entry to pro-
testers who were not Pitt students
before allowing them in at about
10 p.m.

Pitt junior Liam Swanson, a po-
etry and history major, said he was

at the march to “stand in solidarity B

with Occupy Oakland and to pro-
test police brutality.”

The group marched down Forbes
Avenue to Litchﬁeld Towers, where
they chanted, “Out of the dorms
and into the streets.” The group
then tried to enter the Cathedral
of Learning, which was locked. By
7:30 p.m. the march had spilled off
the sidewalk and into the streets.
The protestors marched down the
middle of Bigelow Boulevard and
into the bus lane on Fifth Avenue,

chanting and playing music from

‘a PA system being transported in

a shopping cart.

City police, who had been fol-
lowing the demonstrators through-
out the evening, responded to the
protesters by telling them to get
back onto the sidewalks and sound-
ing sirens from their cars. The pro-
testers responded with chants of
“Whose streets? Our streets.”

Eventuallythe group settled in
front of Soldiers 8: Sailors Memori-
al Hall_ to decry the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan and express their sup-
port for Occupy Oakland. Standing
infront of a black and white banner
spelling out “Fight Strike Occupy,”
war veterans and general protest-
ers took to the microphone to ex-
press their discontent.

“We come here in solidarity
with Occupy Oakland,” one pro-
tester shouted.

KOOKY FOR COCOA? PAGE 8.

Protesters were speciﬁcally an-
gry about the case of Scott Olsen,
a veteran of two tours in Iraq, who
was hit in the head by a projectile
thrown by Oakland police during
last Tuesday’s confrontation. Olsen
has become an accidental symbol
of the movement. Media outlets-
are reporting that Olsen’s skull is
fractured, leaving him unable to
talk.

The Occupy movement began
Sept. 17 when Occupy Wall Street
formed in Zuccotti Park in New
York City. Since then, more than
900 Occupy movements have be-
gun worldwide. The Occupy Pitts-
burgh movement started Oct. 15
with a kick- off march and rally. The
group set up camp at Mellon Green,
but leaves the camp periodically to
protest in different areas.

New Panther Programs in Ghana, Ecuador andChina

Tiffany Grossi ,

Staﬁ” Writer

It’s not a small world, and Pitt’s
Study Abroad Office wants stu-
dents to know that. _

The Study Abroad Office has
introduced three new Panther
Programs in Ghana, Ecuador
and China. Pitt in Ghana is set
to run in the spring, while Pitt
in China and Pitt in Ecuador
are scheduled to start in the
summer.

“We are very, very proud
of the new programs that we
are launching this year,” Jeff
Whitehead, the director ofthe
Study Abroad Office, said in an
email. “These programs are the
result of many months, and in
some cases, years of develop-
ment work from inspired fac-
,ulty directors and staff in the
University Center for Interna-
tional Studies.”

Pitt in Ghana made it to the
forefront of potential study
abroad programs afterjoseph

Adjaye, faculty emeritus of’-

African Studies, proposed the
idea.

The Ghana native has direct-
ed numerous study abroad pro-
grams over the past 25 years,
and this spring he will be the
'program’s director and the only
Pitt professor to join the_Uni-
versity of Ghana faculty in this
program.

Offered only in the spring,
this will be the first semester-
long Panther Program in Afri-
ca. Students who make the trip
will study at the University of
Ghana, which Whitehead said
is “one of the premier, compre-
hensive institutions of higher
learning in Africa.” In collabo-
ration with various academic
departments at Pitt, the pro-
gram offers courses in Africana

studies, history, anthropology, ‘

political science and music.
Students will live in the In-
ternational Students’ Hostel
on campus, eating at canteens
and restaurants provided by
the University for the students

and staff.

Adjaye said that the facul-
ty, along with the experiential
learning that the students will
encounter, allows for a compre-
hensive cultural experience.
Each academic course is‘ paired

with a field trip to a histori- o

cal site.

“For example, the study of
European slavery in Africa will
be reinforced by a field trip to
one ofthe slave dungeons... and

a lesson on African systems of -

government will be enhanced
by direct observance of Parlia-
ment in session or a local chief
holding court,” Adjaye said.
Adjaye encourages enroll-
ment into the new Panther
Program in part because the

We are very,
very proud
of the new
programs.

overall cost is reasonable for
college students. In-state stu-
dents will pay $9,200, while
out-of-state students will pay
$13,018.

Adjaye saidthat the cost
difference between a semes-
ter at Pitt and the University
of Ghana allows the regular Pitt

tuition to cover tuition, airfare"

and hostel accommodation in
Ghana. '

With the boundless opportu-
nities that students can experi-
ence, Adjaye finds it unfortu-
nate that enrollment has been
low ‘so far.

“I am anxious that we do get
a good number to assure con-

tinuation in subsequent years,”

Adjaye said.

Whitehead said only three
or four students have officially
signed on for the Spring 2012
session. Although the deadline
has passed, students are still

encouraged to apply in the next .

week.

If Pitt students h_ave__al-A

ready decided on their spring
schedule, they still have the

option of hopping..on,,a plane V 
‘tor Napo, Ecuador‘ for ,a"‘m‘oinfh  7
or two duringthe months 

June and July . p _

~ Students may enroll in a
variety of courses focusing on
Amazonian society and the en-
vironment through the Andes
and Amazon Field School, a
private institutiofnfounded, in

1999, according to the AAFS -

website. _ -
Courses and field research

will be conducted by both local

instructors and Pitt faculty. _

Pitt—Greensburg professor J

Tim Savisky will be teaching
Global Ecology during the July
session.

« “We will learn about envi-
ronmental issues, as well as the
issues facing the tropical rain-

forest community right there in I

Ecuador,” Savisky said.

Savisky also said that Ecua-
dor is rich in oil and cacao, so
students will have the oppor-
tunity to observe the pros and
cons of each industry through
excursions throughout the
country.

Students will live on the
grounds of the Andes Amazon
Field Schoolwith three meals
per day provided in a riverside
dining room.

A single session costs
$3,500, but if students pre-
fer to stay for both June and
July, the entire program will be
$6,500. Program fees include
tuition for six to nine credits,
day trips, airport transfers,
housing and health insur-
ance.

Students also have the op-
tio_n of studying in Beijing’ over
the summer through Pitt in

China.‘ Whitehead said that this
is a great opportunity for stu-
dents interested in the country,
the Chinese language or gender
studies. I '

The total cost for in-state
students is $4,800 and $6,708
for out-of-state students for
the summer session.

student loan repayments at 10
percent of their discretionary
income, down from the current
15 percent that Obama enacted
in 2010.

Another order will allow stu-
dents to consolidate their stu-
dent loans.

EDITORIAL

Education gap not
a national crisis

In cities across the country, the
self-proclaimed 99 percent con-
tinues to rally against the growing
income disparity between the rich
and poor. But one writer believes
these activists have failed to rec-
ognize a more problematic social
divide: the education gap.

In a Monday op—ed piece,
New York Times columnist David
Brooks argues that educational
inequality is in some ways more
concerning than income inequal-
ity. People with a college degree,
he says, constitute a singularly
privileged socioeconomic class
whose living conditions far out-
strip those of their less-educated
counterparts.

Brooks is right —- according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, on
average, degree-holders make 75
percent more money than those
without. Furthermore, if the stud-
ies Brooks draws upon are to be
believed, college graduates are
much less likely to have a child out
of wedlock, smoke, divorce or suf-
fer from obesity. Most insidiously,
the children of college graduates
are more likely to successfully
complete college than the chil-
dren of those who didn’t.

Proclaiming this a gross in-
justice, however, may be prema-
ture.

Although college degrees are
undoubtedly more marketable
than high school degrees — and
thus, increase your chances of
becoming wealthy —- we consider
them indicators of upward mo-
bility, not catalysts. If students
have the determination and intel-
ligence to graduate from a four-
year institution, they almost cer-
tainly possess the skills needed

to succeed later in life. Granted,
it’s possible to graduate with me-
diocre grades, but a work ethic
that permits such results will

undermine any future attempts ‘

at prosperity.

Many might protest that col-
lege is an upper-middle-class
luxury and that only a select few
have a chance to excel in aca-
demia. In reality, this is an out-
dated perception: More and more
people are joining theranks of
the college-educated. Over the
past half-century, the number of
college graduates in the United
States has steadily increased. In
1960, only about 8 percent of
Americans older than 25 held at
least a bachelor’s degree. Today
that percentage has risen to 29.9,
according to the Census Bureau.

Of course, not everyone can
afford to attend a four-year uni-
versity, even with all the student
loans currently available. None-
theless, the disparity between
college and high school graduates
is easier to mend than the income
gap that Occupy members have so
outspokenly condemned, at least
from a political standpoint. More
ﬁnancial aid and more funding
for public universities will ensure
that college educations and their
beneﬁts are more accessible.

We agree that the quality~of—
life gap between college and high
school graduates is unacceptably
wide. But rather than deeming
this a national crisis, we should
realize that there are many unac-
knowledged factors contributing
to this dilemma. When it comes
to the education gap, solutions
to inequality are much easier to
attain. . J

‘THE STAMATTACK

Wall Street isn’t as villainous

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

The worst job of my life was my
six-week stint as a community
day camp counselor.

As anyone who knows me
could guess, I was pretty awk-
ward around the young’uns. I
liked talking in full sentences
too much, and I don’t think they
understood any of my satirical
references to Friedrich Hayek.

But the worst part of the job
was listening to kids complain
about the unfairness of their
four square games. Typically,
two or three kids would take
the top positions and destroy all
the others. Sometimes, this was
because they were more skilled,
but mostly they just knew how
to make up rules as they went
along.

Children recognized the in-
justice, but felt powerless to
stop it. The obvious cheating
went on without rebuke.

I think of most of the Occupy
members camping in Mellon
Square or elsewhere as these
same children, 20 years older.
They see rising income inequal-
ity and assume that the people

as some protestors believe

on t-op are cheating —— espe-
cially people in the financial
sector.

But the world isn’t a game
of four square. The increase in
wealth at the top of the pyramid
does not imply that money is
being removed from the rest of
society, and it certainly doesn’t
imply that we’re subsidizing
cheating. Far from conspir-
ing against us, those at the top
often work to our collective
benefit, despite their obscene
salaries.

One arena in which people
become filthy rich is the futures
market. Buyers and sellers make
bets on the future price of a
commodity and often reap vast
benefits. As unfair as this prac-

tice seems, it stabilizes prices,
allowing seasonal industries ‘
-to survive. Tomato farmers,

for instance, need these trad-
ers. Otherwise, when millions
of tomatoes hit the market at
harvest, the price crash from
increased supply would leave
many dusted. So sure, people
get grossly rich from trading
futures, but to everybody’s ben-
efit.

Even more insular practic-
es, like high frequency trad-

MCT Campus

ing, have redeeming aspects.
High frequency trading is the
act of buying and selling huge
amounts of assets for very short
periods of time, using com-
plicated algorithms instead
of human decision-makers to
calculate exchanges. Typically,
the rich benefit most from this

' because they have access to the

proper equipment.

But even this practice im-
proves the economy as a whole.
A February 2011 paper in the
Journal of Finance notes that
high frequency tradingliquefies
markets and provides valuable
pricing information to ﬁrms. So
even if many of these benefits
are transferred to the wealthy,
some good is distributed
through all levels of society.

Of course, the seemingly
biggest example of Wall Street
cheating is the ‘subprime mort-
gage debacle. In this instance,
we’re told, investors knowingly
ripped people off by playing hot
potato with quickly defaulting
mortgages, making billions be-
fore jumping ship.

But this narrative is incor-
rect, according to the University
of Texas’ Jeffrey Friedman and

The only problem with the
Revolution is that Valley Forge

be clear: The people winning
wildly on Wall Street are more

they aren’t producing anything
you can touch or see.

These people are making up
rules in their own four square
games.

But most people making mil-
lions are not cheating at four
square. Even if the rich keep 90
percent of the wealth they cre-
ate, their income in no way pre-
vents others from getting rich.
Perhaps more importantly, just
shuffling some wealth from the
top to the bottom won’t change
things in the long run.

There are a million prob-
lems with the financial situa-
tion we ﬁnd ourselves in now.
Inequality is bad for societies,
both socially and economically.
Thousands of our most brilliant
students are going into ﬁnancial
engineering instead of other
wealth-generating industries.
Simply put, there may be some-
thing intrinsically unfair about
such an unbalanced system.

But that isn’t what this col-
umn is about. Rather, it’s about
the economy not being a game
of four square: When there are
more people firmly in place at
the top, it doesn’t prevent the
rest of us from moving up.

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND .

iGiving time to goodcuuses offers students many unexpected rewards

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh needs me. It needs you
too.

Volunteering is one of my fa-
vorite activities and I do it pretty
often. Working in the community

tﬁnot only gives a volunteer a sense
‘of purpose and happiness, it can
also help teach people about their
city and give them networking op-
portunities.

I’m not alone when it comes
to volunteering. Nationally, 62.7
million people volunteered a total
of 8.1 billion hours of service in
2010, according to Volunteering
i'nAmerica’s website. The average
Volunteer spent about 34.1 hours

_ for no-pay to help others :.

difference” comes up among vol-
unteers at any site. There are other
reasons to get involved, too, from
learning about local issues to po-
tentially getting academic credit,
according to Terrence Milani, di-
rector of Pitt’s Student Volunteer

Outreach ofﬁce.

There are different levels-of’ vol-
unteering. Some people take part
in one-time projects with multiple
organizations, and others spend
their time working at one site‘ re-

peatedly. I do a little bit of both.

For example, through one of the
organizations I’ve worked with —-I
The Pittsburgh Project — I learned
about food deserts, areas where
people have absolutely no access

to nutritious,’ healthy food.

Brett Probert, the volunteer
resources assistant of The Pitts-
burgh Project, reported that so far
in 2011, the group has had nearly
1,200 volunteers work for 6,000
hours.

“Obviously, the impact vol-
unteers make for our ministry is
huge,” he said. “We could not begin
to accomplish much of what we do
without them.”

A lot of organizations utilize
one-time volunteers for various
projects because “episodic volun-

Probert said.

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Anonymous’ an addled mess

Gareth Gebhardt
- Staff Writer

“Anonymous” .
Directed by Roland

Emmerich

Starring Rhys Ifans, Vanessa
Redgrave, David Thewlis
Grade: B- '

cwilliam Shakespeare was a

drunken, illiterate buffoon. So
goes the premiseiof “Anony-

mous,” the latest piece of con— ‘

fused and confusing cinema to
re-examine the Bard’s legacy.
Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of
Oxford (Rhys Ifans), has a pre-
dicament.. He’s,_a,t,alented and
proliﬁc poet forced to publish
anonymously because of his sta-
tus and title — in other words,

ﬁrst-world problems. Needing

a public face to represent his

works at the theater, he hires '

a fictionalized version of Ben
Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) to
pose as the author. But on open-
ing day,.]o{nson gets cold feet,

allowing playwright credit to
fall to a little-known drunken
actor by the name of William
Shakespeare. And thus begins a
tragic comedy of fame, intrigue
and mistaken identity.

There’s_also something rot— _

ten in the British nobility. There
are bastard children, hints of
rebellion and treason, and a
character that is highly remi-
niscent of Richard-III, with his
plots involving royal succession.
The plot gets about as com-
plicated asfour Shakespeare
plays mixed together — which
is pretty much what this film
feels like. It might be advisable

— to take some notes.- .

The biggest problem with

“Anonymous” is that it tries too ‘

hard to do entirely too much,
using plotydevices that mimic
Shakespearean standards. It
crams in twisted threads of in-

-trigue and montages of famous

scenes from “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” “Hamlet,” and
other Shakespearean works, as
well as explosivechase scenes

for the action—hungry viewer.
In studying the Bard’s work so
closely, it’s a shame the film’s
creators did not learn a thing or
two about the perils of employ-
ing multiple identities.

And then there’s the drama
— and it’s not the good kind.
Few moments in ﬁlm will ever
rival the laughable melodrama
of Natalie Portman’s infamous
“Anakin, you’re breaking my
heart!” line in “Star Wars: Epi-
sode III,” but the hysterics that
Edward de Vere and his wife ex-
change might be worthy con-
tenders. “Are you possessed?”
she cries. “Maybe I am!” he re-
torts, and the movie theater’s
audience chortled.

Taking on Shakespeare’s
legacy certainly takes mettle,
and the movie does possess
some admirable qualities,

such as Armesto’s and Ifans’

strong performances. But on
the whole, “Anonymous” just
gets bogged down by too much
toil and trouble to make a com-
pelling ﬁlm. I

ALBUM REVIEW

Instrumental album still
manages to tell stories

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer
Nalada
Lisa Miles
Ravello
B-
Rocks Like: Cello Fury

Not _every album needs lyrics to tell a
story.

Such is the case with Lisa Miles’ Nalada,
the most recent release in her 25-year histo-
ry of performing. A Pittsburgh-based artist,
Miles is a violinist and composer known for
combining classical styles with punk rock
rhythms and creating dark and meditative
music. Her latest album manages to tug at
the emotions of the listeners by using sound
instead of words to tell tales.

Nalada, which means “mood” in Czech, _
features original compositions used in live,
collaborative performances with other art-
ists. The album is completely instrumental,
primarily featuring violin, cello, bass, harp
and guitar, among other instruments.

The lack of lyrics doesn’t make for bor-

ing music, though. Miles’ songs all set a
different mood and manage to tell listeners
a story. Often, the meanings behind the
songs are in their titles, as well as in pitch
and tempo. _
Take, for example, the softly melodic

if track, “Now I See Myself” —— an obviously

self—reﬂective number with an entrancing
sound. In the beginning, a single violin wa-
vers longingly as a vocalist hums between
bars. Halfway through, the tempo picks up
and a guitar strums along in a moment of
musical epiphany.

Some tracks in the album feature a sin-
gle instrument moving freely in a smooth,
relaxed manner. It is apparent that Miles’
sound and style is inﬂuenced by well—known
classical composers, like Mozart.

Other tracks, like “Potent,” combine
a number of sounds, swinging more into
Asian—inspired styles. Brisk, staccato notes
played intensely create a heavy sense of
tension until the end of the song.

Not every song is particularly memo-
rable, but overall, Miles has produced an
impressive instrumental display of com-
position and put a contemporary spin on
classical music. 3 ‘

Volunteering offers learning
experiences about Pittsburgh

Volunteering ( 6

relatively brief, and some opportunities are
lost when a volunteer’s involvement is brief.
This is why there’s another option volun-
teers have that I take part in: volunteering
on a regular basis.

Currently I volunteer with a local mu-
seum and a local animal shelter, and I could
go on and on about the beneﬁts these two
things have brought my way.

Volunteering not only helps with volun-
teer networking, but with career networking
as well. At the Pennsylvania Trolley Mu-
seum, a nonproﬁt museum that operates and
preserves old streetcars, I have a network
of people who are like family to me. People

We could not begin
to accomplish much
of what we do with-
out [volunteers].
—Brett Probert

have written letters of recommendation as
well as connected with me on the website
Linkedln.

I can also add real—world experience to
my resume, like marketing. I also work as
a Volunteer for the Western Pennsylvania
Humane Society’s College Canine program.
The shelter sends volunteers to campus once
a week to help students reduce stress. For
three years now, I’ve helped the group man-
age their online media and I can add those
advertising clips to my resume.

After three years, I’ve bonded with the
coordinator of the program, Marsha Rob-
bins. Last summer, she helped me land an

 

internship I desperately needed to ﬁnish

my major and helped me ﬁnd a job at the ,

same site.

But these are all side beneﬁts of volun-
teering. The real beneﬁt is helping others
and at the shelter, that can make a huge
difference, Robbins said. Animals are calmer
and happier thanks to cat cuddlers and dog
walkers, meaning it’s easier for vet techs
and adoptions coordinators to handle the
animals and do their jobs.

Depending on the site a student picks,
volunteering potentially “enhances academ-
ic performance and pursuits,” Milani said.
Often, people ﬁnd volunteer programs that
match their personal or academic interests,
which means that their volunteer work gives
them extra time to learn and even work

- ahead of their peers. And there are always

the beneﬁts of hands-on experience and
networking.

Some students avoid volunteering be-
cause of time issues, so ﬁnding a great
volunteer site is important. Some require
extensive time on site, but others are very
relaxed about hours students put in.

Fortunately, ﬁnding a place to volun-
teer. that matches your personal interests is
not difﬁcult. Students can ﬁnd a club at Pitt
that aligns with their personal interests and
ask about volunteering opportunities. They
can get involved in religious activities and
service projects, or even talk to professors
about volunteering options in their ﬁelds
of interest.

Google is always a good place to look, too.
On the Student Volunteer Outreach website,
www.svo.pitt.edu, students can sign up to
receive a bulletin that currently reaches
about 9,000 students a month and features
about 150 volunteering sites.

This weekend, consider starting a few
one-time volunteer projects and see where
you want to keep going, what matches your
personality and which one matches your
time schedule the best. What do you have
to lose by trying something new? !

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Andrew Gretchko
Staﬁ Writer
. Ambition .
Wale
Maybach Music/Warner Bros.
Grade: A-

On Tuesday, tweets tagged #Ambition
ﬂooded Twitter in honor of Wale’s newest

album. ’

The latest addition to Rick Ross’s May-
bach Music record label, D.C. rapper.Wale
has put out an album that takes advantage
of his lyrical talent. Keeping the old-school
importance of lyrics alive, Wale has man-
aged to create something special here and
—— as he often tells us —— it isn’t easy. “It’s
all work / No days off,” he proclaims in the
ﬁrst track, “Dori’t Hold Your Applause.”

Nothing could sum up Wale’s project

more than this track. The driving snare
beat is accompanied by a female chorus in
the background, both accentuating Wale’s
D.C. sound. He ﬁlls the song with thoughts
on his treatment in the rap industry.iThi,s
underlying message is repeated throughout
the album, including in the beginning of the
second track, “Double M Genius,” which
Wale opens by saying, “I tried to tell ‘em

I’m one of the / best thinkers of this class 1

Waledemonsirates his hip-hopAmbition with hisnewest album

It seems that no matter how much fame
some artists acquire, they will always feel
they’re being disrespected unless they’re
considered the very best. Fortunately, this
acts as a driving force for artists like Wale to
keep giving their all. The title track, “Ambi-
tion,” discusses this dilemma as Wale, Ricky
Rozay (Rick Ross) and Meek Mill talk about
their climb to the top. The song “Slight
Work,” which features up-and—coming art-
ist Big Sean, focuses on,the amount of work A
Wale has put into his music.

For all the diehard Wale fans out there,
some things never change. Departing from
the radio—rap style he exhibited on his ﬁrst
album, Attention Deﬁcit, Wale is back to
his mixtape roots, and the improvement in
his lyrics shows. As usual, Wale provides
wit and humor in his lines, along with the

usual sports references. ,
2 if 4-The icing on the cake forAmbition is its
focus on the artist. Unlike many rappers
nowadays’, Wale has produced an album
that is centered around him and does not
rely on others to help boost his album’s
sales. A V A —

Wale also deals with the issues plaguing
current hip—hop in his song “Legendary”
4 “Tryna see if real lyric spittin’-can buy
me a Porsche / Tryna see if I get rnyicritics
as silent as auctions.”_A rapper who isn’t
afraid to give us a glance into his personal
thoughts, Wale discusses dealing with the
pressure and stress of receiving criticism
throughout the album.

An album that true Wale fans will ap-
preciate,.Ambition proves that Wale’s goal
of rising to the top of the rap game isn’t
.very far off. I ‘ '

destinies, each knowing that the

game will help decide the Big East’s I E

BCS representative. Saturday’s win-
ner will be on the inside track for
therconferenvce championship.
“It’s all about playing meaning-
ful games in November. From here

on out, every game is a champion- _ -

ship game,” Cincinnati head coach

_ Butchjones said. “That’s the beauty

of playing in a conference: Every-
one’s goal is to .become Big East
Conference Champions. Everyone
is chasing that goal, that dream,
that aspiration. For us, it’s focusing
on the task at hand.”

Pitt head coach Todd Graham
also stressed the importance of
winning the big conference games
in the month of November.

“You practice ‘and do all this
stuff to go ’ into November, and
this league is won in November,”
Graham said. “Right now we are up
against a team that is undefeated
in the league and at 6-1. Cincin-
nati is a top 25 team in the country
and this is the biggest challenge

ahead of us. If we want to win the -

Big East, then we have to go and
win this Saturday. It’s not easy to
win championships.”

The Panthers lost a large com-
ponent of their offense in the loss
of junior running back Ray Gra-

\.

ham, who suffered an ACL injury .

in the win over Connecticut. But
Pitt will still look to continue its

strong ground game against the

every week,” Brown said. “Being
in this game for years, I just know

' that a man can go down like he did

Saturday. When he goes down, you

‘ just have to be ready.”

, Brown will do his best to bring
to the Panthers what Graham did,
but it won’t be easy.

“You can’t stand up and talk
about replacing a player as good
as Ray Graham,” Coach Graham
said. “Zach Brown did a tremen-
dous job coming in and being pro-
ductive. We will have one of our
freshmen come in and play the role

that Zach played. It will be impor- A 1‘

tant for those freshmen to step up
and play.”

Jones knows how important
Graham was to Pitt’s offense, but
the Bearcats are still focused on
stopping the very talented Brown.
After seeing limited action behind

Graham early on, Brown rushed for .
30 yards and a touchdown against .

Connecticut.‘ He was more effec-

tive receiving out of the backﬁeld,

catching nine balls for 84 yards.
“Zach Brown is as good as any

running back in our conference,”
Jones said. “You look at the expe-
rience that he’s had from Wiscon-
sin. When Ray went down early in
the UConn game, they put a lot on
Zach’s plate and he responded. I
don’t see them changing much at
all; they’re going to do what they
do.”

It appears as though the much
maligned Pitt offensive line will
receive a boost this week, as NFL
prospect guard Lucas Nix might
return to play against Cincinnati.

The Pitt and Cincinnati match-
up has recently become a heated
rivalry, largely because of the high
stakes that have ridden on the
meeting in the past few years.

“It’s a rivalry, game and we talk
about winning our rivalry games,”

Jones said. “That’s very important *

ministration. And we all know in

WPIAL provides
pure competition

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

“Friday Night Lights.” “Remember
the Titans.” “Varsity Blues.” We are all
aware of the high school football cul-
ture in this country. The year starts
fresh and new for every team, and
the season goes on until there are
but a few teams left that can win. It’s
corny and cliche, butl love it and you
should, too.

This week, the Western Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic League
football playoffs begin. That’s the
WPIAL, for you out-ofltowners, and
it produces some of the best football
in the country.

Perennial football powerhouses '

like North Allegheny, Pittsburgh
Central Catholic, Thomas Jefferson,
Aliquippa, Rochester and Clairton fill
up the WPIAL’s four brackets, from
big schools’ ‘AAAA” down to small
schools’ “A.”

To give you a better idea of how
dominant the WPIAL (District 7) is,
check out this stat: Since the Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic Asso-
ciation went to four classiﬁcations in
1988, the WPIAL has wonaridiculous
33 total state championships (Dis-
tricts 11 and 4 come in a distant tie
for second, with 11 champs each). On
top of that, WPIAL teams have made
an additional 29 title game appear-
ances, blowing every other district
out of the water.

So this Friday, go check out a local
high school. If you’re from around
here and your team is playing, go
out and support them, orjust ﬁnd
a local n1atch-up that intrigues you.
Want to see a defending state champ
play? Travel to North Allegheny --

just 25 minutes up the road in Wex- -

ford — and watch them take‘ on Fox
Chapel in a Class AAAA ﬁrst-round
match-up. ,

You could also-head to Clairton
— a half-hour south —— and watch as

FOOTBALL

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

No one is who they seem in Big East

, ,football this season.

As Syracuse demonstrated this
weekend by losing miserably at

Louisville a week after dominat— .

ing West Virginia, Big East teams
are easily the most inconsistent in
the country. "

The race for the conference ti-
tle remains as ambiguous as ever.
And with all eight teams in action
against Big East opponents this Sat-
urday, this could be the weekend
that separates the contenders from

. ,the pretenders.

Here are my rankings heading
into this crucial weekend of Big East
football:

Cincinnati —— Coming off a bye,
the Bearcats (6-1, 2-0 Big East) will
face what is probably their biggest
test in conference play up until now
when they travel to Pitt Saturday
night. Cincinnati sits as the last
undefeated team in the confer-
ence, but the Big East’s history has
shown it isn’t always good to have

7:00 pm.

that distinction. Experience might
help the Bearcats break the trend
with senior quarterback Zach Colla-
ros and senior running back Isaiah
Pead leading their high—powered
offense.

West Virginia — The Mountain-
eers (6-2, 2-1 Big East) responded
well after their embarrassing defeat
against Syracuse as they recorded a
vital comeback win in the snow at
Rutgers on Saturday. With Cincin-
nati still onthe schedule, West Vir-
ginia controls its own destiny again,
and that could be a scary thought
for the rest of the Big East teams.
But the Mountaineers can’t look
too far ahead with upset-minded
Louisville coming to town this
weekend.

Rutgers — Despite back-to-back
close defeats, the Scarlet Knights
(5-3, 2-2 Big East) maintain a place
in the top half of my standings. The
top two teams in the Big East seem
to be well ahead of everyone else,
so consider Rutgers the best of
the worst in this conference. Greg
Schiano’s team played its worst half
of the season and got outscored

20-0 in the second half by WVU

.Saturday. The Scarlet Knights will

need to rebound Saturday when
they host South Florida in what is
a must-win game for both teams.
Pittsburgh — The news of Ray
Graham’s_ season-ending knee in-
jury doesn’t bode well for the Pan-
thers (4-4, 2-1 Big East) heading
into the remainder of the season.
The onus is nowon inconsistent
quarterback Tino Sunseri to lead

the Pitt offense down the stretch‘

for Todd Graham’s team, which 4
strangely enough — still controls
its own destiny. This Saturday’s
home test against‘ Cincinnati will
say a lot about what is in store for
the Panthers during the rest of the
2011 campaign.

‘ Louisville —- The Cardinals (4-4,
2-1 Big East) protected home ﬁeld
for the second straight week as
they upset previously high-ﬂying
Syracuse on Saturday. This team has

looked awful at times this season, -

but its defense has been phenom-
enal the past two weeks, and ‘now
Louisville surprisingly has a win-
ning record in conference play. A

diﬂicult road test at West Virginia
this Saturday will show just how
serious Charlie Strong’s young
and talented team is about possi-

_ bly competing for a Big East titl

this season. '
Syracuse — They might be leav-

ing for the ACC soon, but right now B

Syracuse (5-3, 1-2 Big East) exempli-
ﬁes what it means to be a typical
Big East football team. From really
average to incredibly impressive to
shockingly bad, the Orange have
done it all this season, and Satur-

day’s game at Louisville couldn’t
-have gone much worse for Syracuse

fans. On the bright side, the game
at Connecticut on Saturday is the
perfect opportunity for this team to
right the ship and pick up its sixth
win to become bowl eligible.
South Florida —— The Bulls (4-3,
0-3 Big East) ‘manage to move up
during a bye week thanks to how
bad UConn looked against the Pan-
thers on Wednesday. As the only
winless team in. the conference,
South Florida’s title hopes are ﬁn-
ished. Fortunately for them, they
sit only two wins away from being

likely to earn a bowl bid. I don’t
know if the Bulls can beat Rutgers
this Saturday, but I’ll still be sur-
prised if they completely collapse
and ﬁnd a way to ﬁnish with a los-
ing record.

Connecticut —Judging by their
performance at Pitt last week, the
Huskies (3-5, 1-2 Big East) might
just be the least—talented team in the-
conference. With zero star players
and a putrid d‘efensive secondary
that even managed to make Tino
Sunseri and Pitt’s receivers ‘look
good, this team is going nowhere
fast. If UConn doesn’t ﬁnd a way to
beat Syracuse this week, consider
their season over. .

Offensive Player of the Week:
Tino Sunseri, Quarterback, Pitt -

‘ I’ll give some kudos to Sunseri for

_his performance last week. UConn
is awful, but Sunseri’s 419 yards

total touchdowns are still very im-
pressive considering he had to carry

Cincinnati boasts an
explosive offense

Football 4 11 I 

Cincinnati is led by a strong offense, fea-
turing senior dual-threat quarterback Zach
Collaros. He has passed for 1,576 yards and
14 touchdowns in seven games this season.
The senior has also added another 225 yards
and six touchdowns, making the Bearcats’
offense potent.

“We know the magnitude of this week

Cincinnati has the
best rushing team in
the Big East. They are
very well-coached.
—Todd Graham

__..._.._.._-_....;.....- 9’ .... .............

and know what type of team Cincinnati has
to offer,”Graham said. “It will be a big chal-
lenge for us defensiyely. Cincinnati has the
best rushing team in the Big East as well as
the best scoring offense. They are a very well-
coached team.”

The Panthers were sucgessful at stopping

USF’s dual—threat’ quarterback, BJ Daniels,
but Collaros willlook to beat Pitt his arm and
legs. His head coach is hoping that Collaros
stays aggressive and limits his turnovers.
g “One of Zach’s strengths is his ability to
ad-lib a little bit. But it also is managing those
and not making catastrophic plays,” Jones
said. “Sure, you may scramble, but if it’s not
there, throw the ball away and play the next
play. You don’t want to take a person’s aggres-
siveness away and make them play passively
because that’s not in Zach’s game. That’s all
part of managing the offense.” .

Coming off a big, nationallytelevised win
isn’t new for the Panthers. Unfortunately,
after beating South Florida earlier in the
year, the team collapsed against Rutgers.
For junior defensive back Andrew Taglianetti,
there is a lesson to learn from the team’s
struggles earlier in the season.

“We just can’t let it happen again,” Taglia-
netti said. “We were on cloud nine after that
win [against South Florida]. National TV, we
really went out there and played well all in
three phases._I think that this team and the
character guys we have are guys that can go
out there and back that up and continue to
win and play like that. As long as we go out
there and play hard and play smart, I think
we’ll be ﬁne.” ‘

Graham likes his team’s ambition, and the
ﬁrst-year coach wants to see his players come

out and play their best football.

“I feel like we have some momentum going
and I’m excited about this Saturday,” Graham
said. “I feel like this is when we play our best,
when your back is up against the wall and no-
body thinks you can do it. That is when your
true character comes to the top and I think
our guys are going to play their tails off.” 3.
