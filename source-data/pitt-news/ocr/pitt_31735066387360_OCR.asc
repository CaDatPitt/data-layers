Chaplains
aim to
improve
studentlife

By Kelley Butt

News Editor

Contrary to popular belief, the
sole purpose of University of
Pittsburgh Chaplains Association
is not to ”save souls.”

Rabbi Joseph Levine, past
chairman of the organization,
said, ”We don't see ourselves as

dogmatic. Ideally, we're here to

assist the student with any strug-

gles he may be having, but we're .

certainly not trying to impose our
religious values on’ anyone.”

According to Levine, the main

purpose of the campusministry
organization is to enrich the stu-
dents’ lives. Often, the awkward
-transition between-high school
and college is a motivating factor
for students to initi-ally check into
one of the campus-based
churches. _
, Levine said he believes that
”the most effective antidote  is
to establish community bonds.
Often that will lessen missing
one’s family.” «

Levine added, ”We are not in
competition with the area
churches, and we are not work-
ing out of any hostile feelings
towardsthem. We work hand in
hand with them. The difference
is we use a full time staff to serve
the university.”

The Chaplains Association
does not limit functions to reli-
gious servicesonly. Through so-

Condom machine
installed at UPB

By Rae Ann Collette

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh at
Bradford has recently installed a

condom vending machine on its A

campus.

According to the director of
Residential Life and Housing,
Philip Burlingame, UPB students
may now purchase a condom for
50 cents from a vending machine
conveniently located in the Self
Care Center.

Burlingame said the machine
was installed Aug. 21 before stu-
dents arrived for the fall term.

To his knowledge, the machine
has not yet been refilled with the
product, but some condoms have
been purchased.

Burlingame said" student

response to the condom vending
machine has been positive.
”They [UPB students] expect: cl
the machineand look at it as the
university is concerned about the
health of its students,” he said.

Burlingame said some people
have expressed great concern"
over the issue. He said some peo-
ple wrote letters of concern to the

. editor of the The Pittsburgh Press

in regards to an article about the
installation of a condom vending
machine at UPB. ”Butl have not
received any complaints,” Burlin-
game said,

may be one of the first universi-

machine. ’’I haven't. heard of any i

other campuses doing this,” he

”You can just offer your patient
a better deal by being able to do
it in a more rational, calm man-

procedure . without all of this
hurly-burly and scurry.”'

Rally

By Heidi Hanchey

For the Pitt News

The nomination of Supreme

Court Justice Robert Bork ‘has.

caused extreme concern for
many local and national groups
who believe they must protect
their rights.

Locally, the Western Pennsyl-

, vania Alliance to Block Bork was

formed. Over 40 community-
based groups in the Pittsburgh
areaare working individually to
fight the Bork nomination.
According to Maria Northouse,
secretary of the ’ Alliance,
”Through letters of petition and
phone calls [the groups] became
aware that they wereveach striv-
ing to prevent Bork’s nomination

_to the Supreme Court.”

On Aug. 5, these organizations
united to become the Western

that donor organs .' could be
shipped virtually anywhere in the
world,/cutting down on the
amount of waste and allowing
better matches.

About 400 people are awaiting
liver transplants at any one time
in the United States, according to
Arthur Harrell of the American
Council on Transplantation.
About half of them are children
for whom donor organs are par-
ticularly scarce.

Doctors from Ireland said at the
forum Wednesday theyare con-
sidering giving dying babies the
livers of infants born fu|l—term

‘without brains or spinal cords.

PITTSBURGH — Trials were

I  ordered Wednesday for three of

seven people arrested following

7' anattack by whites against blacks

Aug. 16. . -
Magistrate Joan Melvin found a
fourth city man, August Mazza,
29, guilty Tuesday of disorderly
conductand fined him $300 plus

‘court costs. She dismissed two as-

sault charges against Mazza.

Three others, Dominic Fusca,
18, of suburban Shaler Township,
William Huff, 18, and Conrad
Michalek, 18, both of Pittsburgh,
were held for court to face
charges of ethnic intimidation,
criminal mischief and conspiracy.
Fusca and Michalek are also
charged with assault.

Three juveniles were turned
over to juvenile court authorities.

Marilyn Jackson of Pittsburgh
testified at a hearing Tuesday that

0 she was in a store in Pittsburgh's

Morningside neighborhood
when 15 to 20 white males at-
tacked her daughter, Tonya, 14,
and three of the girl's friends as
they waited in a car.

”Some of them had sticks, and
one had a shovel,” Mrs. Jackson

said. ”One of them came at me
and the baby with the ice pick
and said, ‘I'm going to kill this 
child.’ ”

Holliday said Fusca started the
fighting by shoving a bicycle at
them. Holliday said he was lift-
ed and slammed to the ground
twice and was struck in the back
with a baseball bat.

The whites caused $2,700 in
damage to the car by hitting it
with sticks as the blacks drove
away, Ms. Jackson said.

Scheduling the activities does
not fall entirely upon the
chaplains. ”The students are
quite active and vocal in the plan-
ning of mixers, ice cream socials,
study groups and other func-
tions,” said Levine.

The university's Chaplains As-
sociation can also serve as a liai-
son between the student and the
university. If an exam is going to
coincide with a religious holiday,
the Chaplains Association can
see if the exam can be changed
or special arrangements can be
made. Counseling programs also
correspond to the ones offered
through the _university’s student
health center.

The organization's staff is very
diversified. Not only do they em-

and other people who are not
members of the clergy.

”We do refer students to other
organizations if we feel it is
necessary, but we are equipped
to handle problems from the
death of a loved one to career
choices,” said Levine.

Eckankar is the ancient
science of soul travel. It is a re-
ligious organization that offers
people the opportunity to ex-
plore this science.

According to Betty Rapin,
chairperson of the board for
the state of Pennsylvania, ”|t
[Eckankar] is chartered: in
Pennsylvania as a religion un-
der the name Pennsylvania
Satsang Society Inc.”

Eckankar draws some of its
historical origins to temple
carvings in ancient Greece,
scrolls in Egypt, the Sanskrit
texts of Indian culture and the
Pali texts of China and Tibet.
Eckankar was introduced to
the public in 1965 by Paul
Twitchell.

"Part of the religious ritual for

the Eckists is the Satsang ses-
sion. ”A Satsang session is a

A spiritual gathering in the name _

of Eck, in which Eckists discuss
the teachings and readings
made available to them,” said
Rapin.

The organization abides by
these basic principles: The
soul is eternal, with no begin-
ning or ending. Whoever trav-
els the high path of Eck always
dwells in the spiritual plane
with the soul living for the
present moment; it has no past
or future, and the soul exists
because of God's love for it.

For Eckists, God has no
gender and is referred to as
”Sugmad.”

According to Rapin, Eckists
have four basic precepts of Eck
printed on their hearts and
minds.

”There is but one God, and

it's reality is Sugmad. Second-
ly, Mahanta is the living Eck
master, a messenger of the‘
Sugmad in all worlds: psychic,
spiritual and material. The
faithful [Eck] shall have all of
the blessings and riches of the
kingdom of heaven given to
them and that the Shariyat-Ki-
Sugmad is the holy book;
there will be none above it.”
The current spiritual leader,

, Sri Harold Klemp, is the 973rd

living Eck master. He took the
”Rod of Power” on Oct. 22,
1981, which is their spiritual
new year.
However, teaching is not
limited to living professors.
Rapin said, ”An Eckist tran-
scends the physical world,
transcending time and space
to meet the ‘light body’ of the
living Eck master.
”The outer teachings are the

Eckankar: The study of soul travel

tip of the iceberg. Further" 

teachings come from within,
as Eckists project their cons~ .
ciousness to the inner world
where teachings are given by
Eck masters in the dream
state,” she added.

To participate, one can visit
the Eck center to pick up a
book. One can also join a
study program, which is ongo-
ing, according to Rapin.

Eckankar is an individual
path, according to karmic pat-_
ternsand with twin goals: self
realization and God reali-
zation.

Book discussions are held ‘
every Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at
413 Semple St., and videos are.
shown on the second and
fourth Wednesdays of each
month. In addition, group dis-
cussions are scheduled for the

first Wednesday of the month. I ‘S ‘

tives of many of the national
denominations (like Catholicism,
Judaism and others).

Each religious group sponsors
its own activities and religious
services; however, the Chaplains
Association does sponsor ecu-
menical functions.

”One of the most important

aspects our ministry is concerned
with is the ‘total person.’ Students
must challenge the university and
what's around them,” said

Levine.

Hart only human

When Gary Hart admitted he was unfaithful to his wife on

! national television Tuesday night, he admitted that he was a

human being.
Politicians must obey a strict code of ethics (at least while

. under the watchful eye of the media), and those politicians who
5 break that code must be subject to'the wrath of a judgmental
; public. -

Hart was probably this election year's best bet for the

‘ democratic ticket before the Monkey Business scandal broke
. loose.

It is a shame that so many potentially good presidential can-

1 didates have fallen prey to the standards set by the public —

_a public which itself often does not comply with these standards.
According to a report published in the August issue of Life
‘ magazine, Americans agree that the president is ”a moral sym-

'« bol for our nation.” The report went on to "say that 71 percent

of Americans think a president should have higher moral stan-

 dardsvthan the general public.

While the libidos of some politicians have caused their

 demise, it seems unfair that other politicians who have com-

mitted equally and perhaps even more ferocious ”crimes” do
not have to suffer the consequences of their actions because
the public is unaware of them.

Who knows what goes on behind closed doors?

-5 As long as we don't have to see it.

Can you say birth control?

If you're reading this column
during prime time, maybe you'd
better pick it up to read later.1Af-

ter 10 p.m., maybe  you know _

how the networks are about the
use of those words—— condoms,
spermicides, sponges.

There, I've said them. OK, the
networks can't stop me from say-
ing them. After all, I'm a writer.
They can't take me off the page
for talking about birth ‘control.
But why is it that these words
cause such problems?

When was the last time you
saw a condom ad on TV? For a
society that claims to be "free, we
pay an awful lot of" attention to
what people think and do. The
No. 1 rub (no pun intended) is
that we care what society thinks.

We all know about birth con-
trol, so why do the networks get
so uptight at the mention of con-
doms on national TV?

Because society says ”... nice
girls don't talk about  it just
doesn't feel natural  it's an in-
sult to ...”

lnsult or not, would you rather
wind up a premature parent?

Think about that. lftyou, as a
college student, have problems
with the thought of being preg-
nant, how do you think_a high
school student would react?

There's not that much differ-
ence between a high school stu-
dent and a college student, right?
At best, there's a couple of years
separating the two. .

But Americans are _having a
problem that the Europeans aren't
having. Year after year, the birth
rate among children under 16
rises.

At 18, a woman is legally

KELLEY BIl'I"I'

responsible for her actions. She
doesn't need mommy's or dad-
dy's permission for many of the
decisions concerning sex that she
will‘be making.

Come to think of it, I don't
know too many people who con-
sulted with —their parentslwhen
they decided to become sexual-
ly active.

The point is, as a society we are
becoming sexually active at a
younger age than our parents did.

We live in a free country. It's a-

personal choice, but this factlwill,
not prevent even one pregnancy.
Age means absolutely nothing.
Do you think that because she is
not legally an adult she is incapa-
ble of becoming pregnant?

Like most of the European
countries, there is a market devot-
ed to birth control. So why are
there still so many teenage preg-
nancies here?

Recently, in an attempt to curb
this problem, many school dis-
tricts across the country have
been considering the idea of set-
ting up in-school health clinics —
in-school clinics that offer birth
control to the students. And the
idea has met with a lot of
resistance from parents, the
”moral majority" and the clergy.

Why? Is it so terrible to want to
offer these kids a chance to have
a normal life without the added
responsibilities of being a parent?
Should abortion be an alterna-
tive? It can be expensive.

Even if premarital sex and birth
control go against some religious
teachings, that isn't stopping us

from having sex or using con- '

doms. Twenty-four percent of
those polled for the Sept. 7 issue
of Time considered artificial birth
control wrong despite the
church's teachings.

So why are there so many preg-
nant teenagers?

Is it strictly a matter of weigh-
ing the evils — going against
church teachings or having your
parents discover birth control
pills or condoms in the dresser
drawer? Or is it just a lack of com-
mon sense?

Unlike many members of the
clergy, I don't believe that the is-
sue is condoning teenage sex.
We're beyond that stage. It's ir-
relevant if we approve or disap-
prove of it. Kids are having kids,
and the government is subsidiz-
ing it. Offering birth control in
public high school clinics is not
condoning sex. At this point, it's
the only smart thing to do.

Protesting the immorality of the
issue will not do these high
school students any good. Judg-
ing a pregnant 14-year-old for her
decisions isn't going to help her.
Should she decide to have the
child, she will be paying for that
decision for the rest of her life.
Doesn't it seem more reasonable
to stop the problem before there
is one?

Still don't agree with me?

Just suppose ‘one day your
14-year-old daughter comes
home pregnant  at last you'll
realize that this isn't a problem
that will only happen to someone
else’s child. Then how vocal will
your demands be for the availa-
bility of birth control when stu-
dents need it most?

THE Pm NEWS, Thursday, September I0, 1937 '

 

Educational buyers beware

BOSTON — There was a scene
in an old movie, Goodbye
Columbus, that I still remember.
In it, a father is watching his son
bumble through his first day of
postgraduate work at the family
trucking firm. Finally, in exasper-
ation, the older man complains:
”Four years of college and he
can't load a truck.”

It was a wonderful non sequitur
and a ripe portrait of the genera-
tion gap of the early '60s. But it
was more than that. Here was the
man who had paid the education
bill for his son now wondering
what he'd gotten for his dollars.
What had the kid learned in that
fancy college anyway?

I wonder what that son, now a
father, would say of his own chil-
dren, a second generation of col-
lege students. He might be
reluctant to sound as philistine as
his own dad. His pragmatic con-
cerns about the link between
education and vocation exist, but
he may not be comfortable ex-
pressing them so crassly.

Parents today are more likely to
question the content of educa-
tion. ”Four years of college and
he can't tell you what's in the Bill
of Rights! Ten thousand dollars in
loans and she thinks the Phil-
lipines are in the Caribbean!
Seventeen thousand dollars a
year and they don't even read
Plato!” '

These are the updated sounds
of the consumer revolt. As the
price of college outdistances in-
flation and reason, as the ceiling
rises to some $18,000 a year,
$72,000 a degree, not including
books, paying parents are ques-

' tioning not only the value of edu-

cation but the values in it.

I expect this accounts for the
success of_ Allan Bloom's The
Closing of the American Mind.
The book, No. I on the best-

 

 

ELLEN
soomymn

seller list, is as much a product of
the '80s as The Greening of
America (a youth—exto|ling book
Bloom detests) was a product of
the '60s.

The University of Chicago's
cranky curmudgeon offers a
respectable intel|ectual’s com-
plaint: universities no longer pass
on the core of western civilized
thought to the next generation of
the best and brightest. Bloom in-
sists that the university, like the
culture, has become intellectually
wimpy, infected by cultural relati-
vism, unwilling to make value
judgements.

The book's message is less
newsworthy than its sales. The
treatise is uneven — pop analy-
sis masquerading asanti-pop in-
tellectualism. The author, a
philosopher, alternates between
real insight and remarkable blind-
ness. He indulges lustily in bash-
ing: '60s’ bashing, rock-music
bashing, feminism and family
bashing‘.

I don't share his nostalgia for
the campus of 25 years ago, a
place I knew as an undergradu-
ate. Nor do I share his antipathy
to the current ”openness.” He
prefers the days of narrow and
deep-mindedness when, he says,

Catholics and Protestants may
have hated one another ”but at
least they were taking their beliefs
seriously ..."

More importantly, as a parent

of a college student, I don't see_

students in a state of moral apa-
thy, unwilling to wrestle with
good and evil. After decades of
teaching the young, I wonder if
Bloom still listens to them. I
wonder if he still likes them.

Of course, it isn't students who
are buying The Closing of the
American Mind or that other un-
expected hit, Cultural Literacy.
It’s consumers. Bloom's appeal
may not be the text: one profes-
sor’s philosophical yearning for
the great-books tradition of liber-
al arts. It may be the subtext:
warning, today's education isn't
worth the money.

As a parent who just signed at

check for one semester in exact-
ly the same amount as the down-
payment on my house, I un-
derstand the anxiety of the pur-
chaser. How much knowledge
can you get for the buck?

As the price goes up, so do our
demands and our criticisms. The
best universities, with my bless-
ing and Bloom's, are stressing
core curriculums that do teach
our heritage again. But I am un-
comfortable with critics who
stroke my generation by telling us
how great it was in our day and
then insist how much things have
fallen apart. The scoring is more
subtle than that.

Finally, I cannot agree that
higher education has, in the
words of Bloom's subtitle, ”im-

poverished the souls of today's 1

students.” Let the educational
buyer beware. But don't confuse
empty pockets with empty souls.

Casino blues leave him in the red

From the mountains _to the‘.

prairies.to the oceans, America
goes to Atlantic City, the place of
cotton candy and casinos. Where
else can you find so much of the
red-blooded, USA" way of life?

I was 17 when I made my gam-
bling debut. Dressed_in my most
conservative suit, I fooled the
guards at the casino entrance of
the Golden Nugget. With my
hands in my pocket,‘clenching
my wallet, I wandered through
the rows of slot machines and act-
ed like I knew where I was going.

The place was packed with a
melting pot of secretaries, grand-
mothers, tourists, blue-collars,
white-collars, singles, couples
and foreigners of every culture.

I quickly dug in my pocket for
a’ quarter, dropped it into the
nearest slot machine and yanked
the silver handle. The machine
clicked, and I greedily awaited
my fortune. Within a few sec-
onds, a cherry, an orange and a
pot of gold halted in the
machine's windows. I waited for
a few more seconds and slowly
concluded that I lost._

Looking to my right, I observed

‘_ the technique of my fellow lever-
pullers. They moved with a

professional grace in harmony
with their machines. Like clock-
work, they steadily shoved in
quarter after quarter without los-

ing their--focus of the spinning.

fruit in front of them. I noticed a

DIICIIIIN

small elderly woman with a Vir-
ginia Slim cigarette dangling from
her mouth, sitting at the machine
next to me. Half her cigarette was
smeared with the bright red lip-

' stick that matched her fingernails.

Now and then, the bell on the top
of her machine would soundoff
and 20 to 30 quarters would pour
out on to the silver tray below.
She never paused to fill her pock-
ets but- kept her concentration

and steadily played on. She made

it look easy.

My inexperience at the slot
machines was apparent as I stead-
ily lost $15. However, I still had
the rest of my hefty paycheck

...from Bain’s Delicatessen. I in-

tended to make those hours of
cleaning moldy plates pay off.
I strolled to the blackjack ta-
bles. I was certain my luck was
brewing. How difficult could
blackjack be, I thought? You
either hit or stick and try to get as
close to 21 without going over,
sounds simple.‘ How naive I was.
I watched my fellow blackjack
players before participating and
soon realized the game, -was an.
art. ‘
One must possessthe ability to

react quickly _and__lo_gically, yet

 

also have the confidence and
spirit to challenge the odds. There
were countless options a player
had to consider. One must al-
ways ’y’double down" with an I I
when the dealer has anything be-
tween a three and a six. Always

— stick when the dealer has a five.

Always, with no exception, split
the aces. It seemed the best gam-
blers were the ones with the big-
gest bets.

After about five minutes, I felt

my education was complete. I sat
downat the table and placed a

$10 bet. My first card was an ace

and my second card a king.
”Blackjack” the dealer called out,
and I knew, then, this was my
game.

Everyone at the table was
friendly. They said I brought good
luck. A waitress gave me a free
drink, and the guy- next to me
offered me my first cigarette. Even
the dealer seemed to ‘be happy
when I won.

Well, an hour later, I lost every-
thing in my wallet except my bus
ticket. Everyone that I met at the
table had gone. I lit my seventh
cigarette and said good-bye to the
dealer. ”C’est, la vie,” he said.

Leaving the casino, I swore I
would never return. ‘However, I
knew it was inevitable.

Mr. Brown, maybe Pitt isn't

ly offended and my feelings
are deeply hurt by your article
(”Maybe Pitt isn't the school
for you," Sept. 9) on new stu-
dents. I was not aware that
some students like yourself
were forced at gun point to at-
tend Pitt. If you were not
forced, I am confused as to
why you are writing for The
Pitt News....

 In regard to some specif-
ic points in your article:

here. But, you contradict your-
self when you mention the

Mark Brown, Pitt may not be
_ for you.

In his column yesterday he
presented his case why stu-
dents should flee from Pitt. To
support his proposal he
whined about the truly novel
subjects of dorm food, Oak-
land crime and the Towers.

And, might I say, he did it
with such subtlety! Also in the
course of his enlightening ar-
gument he treated the reader
to a devastatingly clever, not
to mention tasteful, analogy
between the University of
Pittsburgh and a sexual
prostitute. '

Sarcasm aside, his article
was awful. The Pitt News, an
otherwise fair quality publica-
tion, really lowered itself
when it printed such a pathet-
ic excuse for journalism.
Brown's article was not en-
lightening or entertaining —
just trite and trashy.

So the question remains,
why is he still here? If Pitt is
such a horrid place, and he is
such a strong advocate of
abandoning this university
why isn't he gone? |’.m sure a
great many students who are
fond of this university would

It seems that the new fall
semester brings vandalism
back to the streets of Oakland!
On to the streets of Oakland!
On Saturday, Sept. 5, at ap-
proximately 12:30 a.m., four
students decided that the sign
that was bolted on my porch
railing was fair game — they
stole it!

The sign was rigged with an _
alarm, and it went off, but by
the time I got out on the porch,
it was gone. I saw four young
men running up the street with
the sign — they were drunk.

My wife and I operate a
small business from our home,
and the sign helps our clients
find us. when they come to
Oakland. This is our second
sign; the first one was taken
last yearat this time!

I have been an Oakland resi-
dent all my life and have seen '
the conduct of the students get I
worse over the years. I under-
stand that I cannot condemn
the entire student body for the
actions of a few, but this type
of conduct is getting out ‘of
hand. I will not put up another
sign — I can't afford it, thanks
to some of the students.

In his column Mr. Anater.

think the same."

Well, Mr. Anater, who are

Very few things in life are free.
Even fewer things at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh come without a
price tag. But there is an alterna-
tive, an exception to this general
rule. The exception is the UP

Gallery on the corner of Forbes-

and Bouquet. ~

The Gallery will hold an open-
ing Saturday, Sept. 12 from 7 to
9 p.m. The show, called "Half-
Life," will feature recent, large-
scale, mixed media collabora-
tions by Shelle Lichtenwalter Bar-
ron and Daniel Burke.’

Both Lichtenwalter Barron and
Burke teach at Mercyhurst Col-
lege in Erie, and show extensive-
ly. In producing their latest
efforts, they worked together on

   

. I

each piece, which is unusual;
most artists complete their work

’ alone.

The UP Gallery is sponsored by
the University of Pittsburgh stu-
dio arts department.

"The gallery is a logical exten-
sion of the studio arts department,
and itis a very visible extension
of the department because of it's
location," says Ken Batista, chair-
man of the department and direc-
tor of the gallery.

"The function of the gallery is
primarily education. It differs
from a commercial gallery be-
cause it is not a sales gallery. No
commissions are made. The
gallery exists to educate the
public.” -

The gallery is staffed by work'-
study students who monitor the
gallery and serve at openings.

With a new single soon to be

says their tightly structured songs

’-'A lot of college radio stations

and they say we're too ‘poppy,’ ”
Rhythm said.

"But Elvis Costello put out

are stuck on the Dead

There is a new show every
month, which begins with open-
ing receptions to kick off the
show. These receptions are free
and open to the public. R_efresh-

Anyone can apply to have a
show at the gallery. That is — any
serious, practicing artist with a
body of work can apply. Artists
are also solicited to show their
work at the gallery.

In the past, a faculty vote decid-
ed whether an artist's work was
accepted for display. However,

instituted and will be curating
and making selection decisions-.

The book is a reprint of the first

seven Godiva sisters, in the 11th

-century, each clad in her birthday

suit: ”Nowhere could there be a
group of young ladies that wast-
ed less time on f_rivol_and froth 
they were simply themselves and
chose not to disguise it.”

i. In the 11th century in England,
the horse remained a mysterious
creature. When Father Godiva is
thrown from a horse and killed,
the seven sisters resolve to dedi-
Cate their lives to the study of
these intriguing animals. Each
naked sister has an adventure rid-
ing her horse while trying to dis-
cover a Horse Truth worthy of
revelation.

What the sisters discover are
proverbs such as ”Don’t ever

”don’t lock the barn door after

even the ancient belief that horse-

shoes are lucky.

THE PITT NEWS

Panthers ready
to meet ’Pack

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

As important as game one was
for Pitt, the second may be cru-
cial just as well.

Saturday afternoon 18th—ranked
Pittishost to North Carolina State
at Pitt Stadium in a 1:30 p.m.
contest. It is the first of seven
home games for the Panthers this
season.

if the Panthers can continue

their winning ways, a successful
season could reap a nice bowl
bid by season's end.

However, in order for the Pan-
thers to win, they have to over-
come one obstacle that haunted
them last season -— injuries.

Junior linebacker Jerry Ol-
savsky, the team's leading tackler
last season, and Nate Heyward,
Pitt's starting fullback, both sus-
tained knee injuries and will miss
the North Carolina’ State game.
They are both expected to be out
for at least two weeks.

Either freshman Prentiss Wright
or sophomore Adam Walker will
start in_ Heyward's place, while
Jerry Wall will move from his
strongside linebacker position to
middle linebacker to replace Ol-
savsky. ‘

Senior James Turner should see
his first start ever as a Panther,
taking over at VVall’s strongside
linebacker spot.

North Carolina State's

' problems may be a little more se-

vere, but injuries are not the
problem. The truth is that only
one starter, guard Jeff Hojnacki,
i’s injured, and he's questionable.

The Wolfpack is coming off a
disappointing season opening
loss to arch-rival East Carolina last
week, 32-14.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried isn't
taking North Carolina State light-
ly, though. He overlooks the East
Carolinaloss and instead speaks
of the 49 lettermen returning

from a Wolfpack squad that went
to the Peach Bowl and sported an
8-3-1 record last year.

"We’re going to be in for a
fight/"said Gottfried.

North Carolina State coach
Dick Sheridan, who was inter-
viewed by-Pitt for the vacant
coaching job after Foge Fazio,
was dismissed in 1985', wasn't
pleased with his team's opening
season loss.

"We weren't a good football
team [last week], and we got beat
by the weakest team on our
schedule," said Sheridan. "We
will work with what we have."

The quarterback situation for
the Wolfpack looks very bleak as
sophomore Shane Montgomery
and freshman Preston Poag will
have to fill _the shoes of Erik
Kramer, last season's ACC Play-
er of the Year who graduated.

Replacing Kramer will be no
easy mission, neither for the quar-
terbacks nor for Sheridan. This
leaves Sheridan in a quandary as
to what to do. '

"Both [quarterbacks] are very
close and both will probably
play,” said Sheridan. "Mont-
gomery may start. I'm not sure
yet.”

Sheridan has nothing but
respect and kind words for the
Panthers because of their all-
around good play and consisten-
cy in a 27-17 win at Brigham
Young Sept. 1.

"Everybody’s going to have a
problem with them. They have a
very fine finesse game and pass-
ing game,” he said.

Pitt fell to a quick 7-0 deficit in
the Brigham Young game but
quickly recovered andrled at one
time 27-7.

Senior quarterback Sal Genilla
threw for 166 yards and two
touchdowns, while Craig "lron-
head” Heyward ran for 136 yards
and tossed a 17-yard pass to wide
receiver Bill Osborn for a

Pitt soccer team

By Vince Carey

A Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther soccer team
opened its 1987 campaign last
night at Pitt Stadium by outlast-
ing Slippery Rock 2-1. ‘

"We madea few mistakes,”
said Pitt head coach Joe Lux-
bacher. "Yet overall it was good
to come away with a win.”

The game started off slow, but
quickly picked up pace. Pitt's
offense started to gel. A couple of
shots were warded off by Slippery
Rock goaltender Tim Robinson.
Then with less than four minutes
gone, Pitt scored on a perfect pass
by Dave Moss to Mike Grimes.

"The pass was just perfect,”
said Grimes. ''It was right in front
of the net, and I barely had to
touch it. As far as the game was
concerned, I think we played
well. The defense made a few

mistakes, but we will get‘ better as

the season moves on." _
The goal picked up the Pitt

team. They continued to press the P

Slippery Rock goal. Then with
34:49 left, Grimes took a shot
that hit a Rockets’ player in the
hand. As a result of this the Pan-
thers were awarded ’a penalty
shot, which Moss quickly
deposited into the back of the ne
to give Pitt a 2-0 lead. '
_ "That was kind of an iffy call,
but we'll take it," said Grimes.
As the game continued, the Pitt
defense“ did a disappearing act.
Slippery Rock pushed the ball.
into the Panther end. But Pitt
goalie Mark Hendricks hanged
tough to preserve the shutout.
Then about halfway into the
first half, the Rockets mounted
another attack. A couple of pin-
point passes took Hendricks out
of the play as the ball sailed
towards the net. Yet all was not

lost when Panther Scott_A_rm-

touchdown.

The 6-0, 260-pound Heyward
also caught two passes for 66
yards in the BYU game. Obvious-
ly, Heyward is a multi-
dimensional player who could
pose problems for North Caroli-
na State.

"We’ve got our work cut out
for us. He is a well-rounded ver-
satile player,” said Sheridan.

Sheridan knows of what he
speaks. In last year's 14-14 game,
he saw what the Pitt squads can

wins home opener, 2-1

strong knocked the ball away at
the last minute. .

"We played - -the first ten

minutes of thegame good, but
then stopped,” said Moss. ”We’ll
get better though.”
. The rest of the half moved
along slowly, with both teams try-
ing to get in on goal. Nothing
very serious’ happened, and time“
ran out with Pitt ahead 2-0.

”We lost our concentration a
little, but we were lucky it didn't
hurt us,” said Hendricks. "The
defense got confused at times,
but I'm confident that they'll get
better.”

Pitt came out firing in the se-
cond half. They quickly moved
the ball down the field, and
mounted a few serious drives
only to be turned away by a few
things. First, the play of the Rock-
ets goaltender, who made some

"diving saves. Second, there were

a few mental mistakes, like a mis-

Linebacker Fred Stone had 18 tackles in N.C. Stat’s e" w-

.do without much pressure. And

because of his own calculations,
he was able to steer at least the
tie' at the end of the 4th quarter.

Sheridan saw this as a stepping-
stone for the rest of their success-
es last season.

”The game gave us a lot of.con—
fidence,” he said. ”§omehow we
got breaks to salvage the tie. This
[victory] prepared us to go
through with the rest of the
season.”

But Sheridan does not know if

played pass, that stopped drives.

Then with about ten minutes
gone the Slippery. Rock offense
came to life. They moved down
the field, and crashed in on goal.
They were finally able to get on
the scoreboard on a free kick that
sailed through the defense, and
into the net. The Pitt lead was cut
in half.

’’I think that their goal was a
result of some defensive confus-
sion,” said Hendricks. "After it
was kicked, there wasn't much
that could be done."

The game slowed down after
that. Mistakes on both sides
turned the offenses away. The
best entertainment that could be
found at this point was watching
a collection of kids racing on the
track behind the teams benches.

Pitt came back to life with
about 11 minutes left to play.

They’ moved the ball with the".

Tennis team preps for CMU and Penn State ‘

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt women's tennis team
will start their season off with a
weekend of tennis, beginning this
Friday when they host CMU at
Trees Hall, followed by an away
match against Penn State on
Sunday.

Pitt has had no trouble defeat-
ing CMU in previous match—ups,
last year's 8-1 victory for the Pan-
thers is a prime example.

This year, Pitt head tennis
coach George Dieffenbach stress-
es the fact. that CMU is not a team
to be taken lightly.

”Playing CMU is a good way
to start off the season. We will

really have to play well to win,”
said Dieffenbach. ”CMU has a
new coach, Richard Sceines.
They also have a couple new girls
in the line-up, so we really aren't
too sure what to expect from
them this year.”

The Pitt women's tennis team
will face an even more challeng-
ing match on Sunday against
Penn State, whom they consider
to be one of the toughest teams
on their schedule.

The Nittany Lions rolled over
the Panthers last year, as they
have done in previous years, 9-0.

Preparing to play such a team
is not easy, but the Panthers al-
ways look forward to playing this
top-caliber team.

   

”To prepare for the Penn State
match, we will work hard in prac-
tice, hopefully do well against
CMU and set a competetive line-
up,” said Dieffenbach. ”Playing
against a top team like Penn State
is always a challenge and acts to
raise our team's level of play. It's
a good experience. We would
like to win some sets off them this
year, though.”

The Lady Panther’s line-up is

not yet completely set.
The No._ 1 through 4 singles po-
sitions have been decided, but
the No. 5 through 7 positions are
still up for grabs.

Sophomore Tracy Feltingoff
will move up into the No. 1 sin-
gles position for the Panthers af-

VTHE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September l0, 1987

ter a solid freshman year playing
at No. 2.

”My game has improved a lot
this summer,” said Feltingoff.
’’I’m playing more aggressively
now. Lifting weights this summer
has made more serve stronger.”

Dieffenbach is pleased with the
improvement he sees in Feltin-
goff’s game.

”Tracy is playing a lot better
this year. She has greatly im-
proved over the summer,” said
Dieffenbach. ’’It will naturally
take some time though for her to
play at the same level Jodi Levine
did.” (Fifth year senior Levine
was the Panthers No. 1 singles
player last season).

position will be senior Carrie de-
Vera. Playing at No. 3 will be
junior Bonnie Kartzman, and the
No. 4 position will be played by
senior Stephanie Nelson.

The uncertainty involves the
No. 5 through 7 positions for
which Dieffenbach said the com-
petition between incoming fresh-
men is close.

Play-off matches are held be-
tween team members to deter-
mine team position.

Jill Cohen from Mt. Lebanon
High School, Sandy Hunt from
Hempfield High School, Sarah
Glick from Carlisle High School,
Sharon Jaffee from Coral Gables
High School in Miami, Fla., and
Gwen Mclntyre from North Al-
legheny High School will com-
pete for the open positions.

The Panthers will play their
toughest schedule this season
with the addition of such top-
flight teams as Temple, Bowling
Green, and Clarion. '

Volleyball
team has
Georgia
on mind

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

‘The Pitt women's volleyball
team will face one of the tough-
est challenges of their season ear-
ly on, when they host nationally-
ranked Georgia at the Field
House, Monday night.

The Georgia match is especial-
ly important for the Lady Panthers
because an early season upset of
Georgia might mean a better
draw at the NCAA Champion-
ships for the Panthers later on in
the season.

(‘A win against Georgia Mon-
day night would have a positive
effect on the rest of our season,”
said Collier. ”Georgia is a top 16
team. lf we beat them we would
then be considered a legitimate
top-ranked team.”

’’If we can be consistent and .

win at that level, it would raise
the level of our program,” con-
tinued Collier. ”Ourtrouble spot
in the past has been losing at that
level of play.”

A factor that may affect the
Lady Panthers in Monday night's
match is the full weekend of
volleyball they will play at the
Temple tournament this
weekend.

Pitt is favored to win the tour-
nament, which they will start on
Friday playing against George
Mason and James Madison.

Saturday will provide a interest-
ing grudge match between Pitt,
last year's Big East Champ, and
last year's Big East runner-up,
Providence.

The Lady Panthers will also
take on Bowling Green on Satur-
day. Bowling Green, who recent-
ly_upset nationally ranked Purdue
will provide a sizeable challenge
for Pitt.

’’It will be a tough tournament,
but if we can win it, we should
be extremely confident for our
home opener,” said Collier;

5-THE NFC EAST
, Last time we saw the Washing-
ton Redskins, they were being
waxed in a 17-0 loss to the Giants
inthe NFC title game. But then
again, the Giants manhandled the

. Skins three times last season, so

the memories aren't really all that
distinct and memorable — kind
of like one 9-hour game spread
out over four months. What
should elevate Washington to the
top of the East is their Top Gun
offense, which is your basic Full
Metal Jacket. Quarterback Jay
Shroeder, Washington Redskin’s

' Gary Clark and Art Monk and

running backs Kelvin Bryan and
George Rogers all have a full sea-
son together behind them, so that

HOIJVSZ

faction should operate like clock-
work. The Hogs are healthy, even
though some new faces may be-
gin to surface in the line-up.
Washington is competent defen-
sively, although the linebacking
corps has become stale — and in-
jured, as Neil Olkewicz could
miss all of '87 — and the secon-
dary is inconsistent. Regardless,
the Redskins have the only
offense in the NFC capable of
shredding the defenses of the Gi-
ants and Bears. And shred they
will. 13-3.

I've said it before and I'll say it
again — it's too hard to repeat as
Super Bowl champions. But for
some odd reason, the New York
Giants don't want to hear that
gibberish. They avoided any.off-
season, off-the-field troubles,
avoided contract problems — mi-

Reasons — had a successful draft,
and basically have nothing wrong
with them. At all. And that's just
it — the whole thing seems too
smooth to be true. What New
York did avoid last season was in-
juries to key people, the silent
killer of champions-of-yesteryear.
How long can quarterback Phil
Simms, who was a walking dis-
pensary earlier in his career, re-
main intact (he’s played the last
3 seasons relatively injury-free)?
How long can little Joe Morris
take the punishment of being
crunched by men twice his size?
And how long can the team's
passing game thrive without a
truly explosive receiver?
Although first-round selection
Mark Ingram of Michigan State
has exciting potential, his contri-

‘ bution remains to be seenf For

the Giants’ sake, Ingram had bet-
ter pan out, for the team shipped
starter Bobby Johnson to San Die-
go. Complacency? A rest on the
Iaurels? The silence is deafening.
12-4. I
It's been quite some time since
the Philadelphia Eagles have
fielded a competitive football
team -— not as long as a few other
losers in the league, but certain-
Iy long enough for Eagle -fans.
This year things might start turn-
ing around. Slowly, head coach
Buddy Ryan is acquiring the type
of players capable of executing
his famous, high—pressure ”46”
defense. The '87 draft yielded a
killer defensive tackle in Jerome
Brown and a tough OLB in Byron
Evans. Team these guys with All-
Everything pass rusher Reggie
White and DB's Wes Hopkins
and Roynell Young, and the Ea-
gles have a pretty solid founda-
tion on which to build. The
ground game will go as Keith
Byars goes. And now that old-
timer Ron Jaworski has" been
waived and is in Miami, the QB
job is Randall Cunningham’s to
lose. But if the offensive line can't
improve on the 104 pitiful sacks
it allowed last season, the bruised
Cunningham won't be physical-
Iy capable to do even that. 8-8.
Who would have predicted
that the timeless Dallas Cowboys
would finish at a miserable, un-

characteristic 7-9 last season,
their first losing season in 22
years? Not 35 year-old QB Dan-
ny White. Not Herschel Walker.
Not WR Mike Sherrard. Sad
things for Cowboy fans is that the
team may helplessly endure its
second losing season in 23 years
if these three guys don't become
active, healthy football players.
Well, Sherrard is unquestionably
lost for the season with a broken
leg, White's wrist may never
heal, and Herschel has a bum
knee. The offense is only the best
thing the Cowboys have going for
them —- talent—wise, that is. And
to a team with a stagnant talent
well about two inches deep, they
can't afford to lose what little they
have. 6-10.

The St. Louis Cardinals? That
team with a psyched-out,
washed-up quarterback and an
incredibly inept backup and an
owner who's constantly making
the city miserable with his‘ ”by-
the-time-we-get-to-Phoenix”
threats and an unimaginative, slo-
mo offensive scheme and a rag-
tag, give-what-the-offense—wants
defense and fed-up, mad-as-hell
fans and the uncanny ability to
produce the league's annual
stinko draft and a ”we don't mind
losing” attitude and  and  I
don't even wantto talk about this
mess. 3-13,.

THE NFC CENTRAL

”There’s baars in them thar
hills,” a panicky, greybearded,
goldmining hillbilly once yelped
in a frenzied? gallup down the
mountainside. And something
else, Festus — there's bears in that
thar NFC Central who could
probably scare those other bears
right out of them thar hills, then
go ahead and steal the gold of the
Super Bowl. The Chicago Bears
are stacked everywhere, even at
quarterback to coach Mike Dit-
ka’s dismay. Trouble is, their best
one, the inspirational Jim McMa-
hon, is_beaten up pretty badly. If,
and it's a big if, he ever fully
recovers from off—season shoulder
surgery, look out NFL — this
team will win the Super Bowl.
But if he doesn't, which is much
more likely, then Chicago will be
a burly body without a head, a

scarecrow without a brain, a
goldmine without the gold. 1 1-5.
' The Minnesota Vikings — the
sleeper teamof 1987. But first,
QB Tommy Kramer must go cold
turkey and get himself off the
booze — an alcoholic quarter-
back might be the life of the
party, but not the leader of a Su-
per Bowl team. So far, so good.
The Vikes snapped up Penn
State's D.J. Dozier in the draft,
thereby bolstering the sometimes
flimsy rushing attack. Kramer al-
ready has four, count ‘em, four
explosive wideouts as targets in
Leo Lewis, Hassan Jones, Steve
Jordan and Anthony Carter, so
the passing game will again be
threatening. The defense is tough
and durable, led by all-kamikaze
defensive back Joey Browner.
Last year, Minnesota gave scares
to the Giants and Redskins, while
breaking Chicago (23-7) and San
Francisco (27-24). With a little
luck, they could take all four this
time around. 10-6.

_ For some strange, demented‘
reason, I have this incredible faith

in the Detroit Lions. I don't know
why — maybe it's some bizarre,

-chemically induced phantas-

magoria — but I have reason to
believe Detroit is a good football

team, you know, a lion in sheep's »

clothing. True, Darryl Rogers’
club has been nothing more than
a bunch of Little Bo Peeps pranc-
ing around the Silverdome since
last winning the Central Division
in 1983. The 1987 schedule is a
toughie, but if QB Chuck Long

, emerges as a solid team leader

and if running backs James Jones
and Gary James play like men
possessed and if hard.-nosed rook-
ies Iike DE Reggie Rogers and NT
Jerry Ball make some noise on
defense, the lambs_cou|d once
again become lions and march
into the playoff picture.
Phantasmagoria? Uh, I think I
hear reality setting in. 7-9.
Figure the arm of Vinnie
Testaverde is worth at least three
wins by itself. Pair that with the
two victories that the Tampa Bay

-Buccaneers scrounged up by

themselves in '86 and this team
is moving in the right direction.-
New head coach Ray Perkins will
instill some discipline and grit in
his spineless inheritance. The key
for Perkins now is time. Like the
Buffalo Bills, Tampa Bay has a

new quarterback foundation on-

which to build — Testaverde is
truly terra firma. 5-11.

A prophetic, pathetic ditty
based on the Stroh’s beer com-
mercial jingle — ”Now you're
talkin’ football, Now you're
talkin’ beer, Now Forrest's still in
Green Bay, But he won't be
’round next year.” Pretty clever,
huh? Beer, football, Milwaukee
breweries, the Green Bay Pack-
ers. Looking into my crystal ball,
I see Forrest Gregg being the first
head coach given the boot in
1987. The quarterback-less Pack-
ers area stale team, ready to as-
sume Tampa Bay's position as the
Central’s sediment..,,QB’s Randy
Wright, Don Majkowski and
Robbie Bosco won't take the
Pack anywhere. And when the
team goes nowhere, the coach is
usually given the free ride out of

THE P|1T NEWS ‘FOOTBALL SUPPLEMENT

PITT STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By John Enright

Editor in Chief

t’s a hot, humid Saturday night in
Raleigh, N.C., where the Pitt Pan-
thers are taking on the_ North
Carolina State Wolfpack in Carter-
Finley Stadium. '
Holding comfortably to a 14-3 lead in
the fourth quarter, Pitt appears headed for
its first win of the season under new head
coach Mike Gottfried.

 

Despite Pitt's win against BYU -and
N.C. State's loss to East Carolina,
coach Mike Gottfried thinks the Pan-
thers may still be in for a fight.

 

The previous week the Panthers failed
in their first attempt to initiate Gottfried
into the all—time Pitt win column by los-
ing to Maryland.

But on this night, Pitt's 11-point lead
seems secure.

With five minutes remaining in the
game, members of the press head off to
the elevator to beat the rush of
newswriters down to the lockerroom area
for post-game interviews.

When the writers arrive on the field
minutes later, the scene has changed.
Pitt's lead has suddenly shrunk to three,
and seconds later, the game is tied.

That's how it ends — tied, 14-14.

While the early exiting media members
ask their associates how North Carolina
State got back in the game, Gottfried, a
man who admits he can't stand defeat,
can only ask why.

Thirty minutes after the game has con-
cluded, a sullen Gottfried paces the side-
lines of the now empty and quiet stadium,
trying to understand where his team went
wrong.

That wasthe scene exactly one year ago
tomorrow.

‘Pitt would go on to win ‘five of its last
nine games in '86, finishing the year at
5-5-1 . ‘But each loss brought Gottfried and
his staff players down. V .

But so far this year, Gottfried and the

 PREGAME  

PITT VS. N. C. STATE

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1987, 1:30 PM.

Gottfried enters with reserved confidence

Pitt football team haven't disappointed
anyone. But remember, it's still early.
That's why Gottfried isn't satiated just yet.
There are 10-games to go, 11 if the Pan-
thers go to a bowl game.

Gottfried thinks North Carolina State,
despite a surprising 32-14 loss to East
Carolina in its opener at home last week,
poses a threat to his Panthers in this af-
ternoon's 1:30 contest at Pitt Stadium.

”[North Carolina State] -is coming off
the Peach Bowl with a lot of returning
players. We expect a tough ballgame,”
Gottfried answers when posed with the
how—can-you-take-this-team—serious|y bit.

But considering Pitt's — and not North
Carolina State's — first game perfor-
mance, that question may have some
merit.

The Panthers beat the Brigham Young
Cougars, 27-17, in Provo, Utah Sept. 1.
The score wasn't indicative of the domi-
nation Pitt displayed. The Panthers had
one touchdown called back because of
a penalty, missed two field goals, gave
BYU two points on an intentional safety
and blew a coverage allowing the Cou-
gars’ first touchdown. '

-5 Obviously, the score was deceptive.

The Panthers performance was reason
for alumni and fans to celebrate, but not
Gottfried. He doesn't let his emotion
show, or at least not when he wins

anyway.

Privately, the satisfaction of a win. is 1 I

there for Gottfried, but outwardly he re-
mains the steady-handed mentor at the
helm of the program, looking on to the
next opponent with the businesslike ap-

proach necessary in an occupation where-

you're paid to win games.

’’I think sometimes you can spend so
much time talking and thinking about the
win [that] it bothers you the next week,”
he said.

Displaying his emotions could be
detrimental to his players also. There are,
of course, delicate 19- and 20-year-old
egos he has to massage.

Keeping things in perspective is as
much a prerequisite on this level of
coaching as teaching the X5 andUOs.

”Football is an emotional game, but

you still have to play every week,” said‘

Gottfried. ”Anytime you get a road game
out of the way and win — that's a plus.

But, as I told our players, [BYU] is in the.

[Last now. That's over, so now you just go
to the next [game] and get ready for NC
State. ‘ 2
’’We’ve talked to the team about adver-
sity and prosperity. We've handled both.
When you have this much invested, you
don't take a day off. We're going to play

. hard 11 football games this season. There

will be no letdown.”
