yesterday that the UQS. and I

Europe should aid carefully-

selected groups of German stu-

dents if the problem of a div-
ided Europe is to be solved.

on to point -out that two minority ,

Germany down a democratic road.
These‘ two groups, according to
Sorensen, who recently completed
an‘ educational survey in Ger-

I‘ .'many for the American Military

Coed     
Set   for Tomorrow "

I . Three-hundred and ﬁfty freshmen women are scheduled to par-
ticipate in traditional Lantern Night ceremonies tomorrow in Foster

Memorial and the Commons Room

‘ The class .of'1952 will be swelled by 41 Johnstown Center fresh-
‘men who plan the trip to Pittsburgh especially for the ceremony.
In what is known as the oldest traditional event here, Queen
Corrine Nelan of the class of 1948 returns to pass on the light of

the recent graduating class to the”
incoming freshmen.

Described as the apex of events
for freshmen‘, the ceremony is,
perhaps, the only one of its kind
in the world.

Although limited seating facili-
ties prevents the general public
from viewing the event, parents
of freshmen are invited to attend,
according to Jeanne Elliot, chair-
man of the WSGA Traditions
Committee. .

Parents may be seated on the
Commons Room level. Those who
do not‘ ﬁnd seats in this area may
stand or be seated on the bal-
conies of the second and third
ﬂoors. G.uests'are asked to arrive
by 7 p.m., using the Fifth Avenue
entrance.

DON'T CONDEMN
MIKE TOO SOON,

Condemnation of Head Football Coach \Valter (Mike) Mil-

ill-advised.‘Tl1ere are several circumstances that ought to be

considered bef_ore'Mike' has to_take this premature abuse.

.

Because of several bad breaks in the first two games,
against top-notch Southern Methodist and.Notre Dame, the
transition that Mike has made from a defensive club trying to
hold the score down to an offensive team has not been as appar-

I

ent as it might have been.

The Pan.tl1ers gained 321 yards net from rushing and pass-

z eﬁea-am '3 ~I30l010O “Kevin -SM':1N i.I..|.l'd.: -EH1

ing against Southern -Methodist. Add to this the 165 yards on
kick returns. Throw in 249 yards from scrimmage plays and
176. yards on punt: a11d kickoff returns in the Notre Dame
game.

In nine games last year, 1009 yards was the meager Panther
total on scrimmage plays. Two games this year have resulted
in over half that .total+570 yards.

True, a game is measured by the score. But- the bad breaks
sustained against SMU and ND will not last all year. Not
every team will catch the speedy Jimmy Joe Robinson from
b.ehind as happened‘ to prevent at least one ‘touchdown in
each of the games to date. ' '

Time running out cost a ﬁrst—half score in the SMU battle
and a. la.st-minute tally against the Irish.

It must be admitted that the blocking and tackling. were
bad especially against the _ surprisinglyflstrong Irish. It
is reasonable to expect that someimprovement will be shown
in subsequent games. The experience of the players indicates
this. -= ‘

/

"No one can deny that the Panthers furnished a share of
oﬁensive thrills against two ‘teams out of the class of the'Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Not so long ago everyone was wondering why the Pan-
thers didn’t do a litle more gambling. And fans raked Mike
over the coals for his defensive game and his announced policy
of “holding down the score.”

 _ ‘The argument was that it was just as bad to l.ose by 30
points as it was to lose by 40 or 50. Just two weeks ago when
the Jungle Cats took to the air against Southern Methodist’s
Mustangs the complaint was that they started too late in
the game. 

Last week Mike and the boys took chances from the Very
beginning. Unfortunately _the first pass was intercepted and
resulted in a Notre Dame touchdown. But instead of showing
their appreciation for at least the attempt the fans just
groaned. It seems that even when you give people what they
want they still‘ refuse to be pleased. . I . '

Sure, we lost the Notre Dame game. ‘But at least the Pan-
thers didn’t just stand around and wait for the Irish to beat
them. They didn’t merely try to hold down the score-they
tried to win. a ‘ ‘ i A »

I

\
It’s an encouraging sign to see this changein attitude.
'And continued against teams in Pitt’s own class, _i.e., West
Virginia and Penn‘ State, is bound to bring an improvement.

Notes    

BY JERRY NEWBURG

West Virginians: Their — Cause
and‘ Cure. '

Origin: According to Dr. Far-
quar Gundleﬁnger, leading an-
thropologist from the University
of Wyoming, the species “west
Virginian” "is possitively not de-
scended from the classiﬁcation
Homo Saipens. This comes as no
surprise after having just read the
new Thorne Smith novel, Sprung
from the Ape. v

Mr. Smith claims that the “west
czirginian,” about the year 70,000
B.C., branched off from the lower.
anthropoids but not very far. (Ed.
note: No self respecting anthropoid
will admitit.) Dr. Albert Einstein,
whose theory on relativity claims
that everyone in the worldis re-
lated to everyone else, makes-no
mention -of the “west Virginian”.
Kinsey, the famous whiskey, and
author of Behavior of the -Human
Male, refused to include the “west
Virginian” in his ﬁnal results, stat-
ing that his thesis material was
strictly gathered and accumulated
from the activitiesof the “human”
male. '

A Mr.‘ Ray Sprigle, to better

study the habits of the phylum.

“west Virginian,” attempted to dis-
guise himself and Venture forth
into the land of the moonshine
and the hill-william. But the at-
tempt was thwarted when‘ Mr."
Sprigle had difficulty in growing
another head. i as
They Had a Band, Too

Other pertinent facts: The “west
Virginian” marching band is com-
posed of 32 jug-blowers, two
zithers, a violin, and a drummer
who used to play for Joe Grape
and his.Bunch. The “west Vir-
ginian” marching band is‘ straight
from a triumphal two weeks en-
gagement at a comfort station on
Route 66. t '

Physical Characteristics: The
“west Virginian” is easily distin-
guished from the human race be-
cause. of their low forehead, long
arms, heavy, unkempt, matted

beard and thick skull hair, short-

squat legs, and big, bare-footed
feet. Season opens Oct. 3, closes

Dec. 9. Limit: bucks, 3 -points, 2.’

Does, not worth effort. .

Tomorrow the “west Virginian”
will be in town. Leave us not treat
these poor, backward, people with
.the arrogant air of the conqueror.
Add Eighf-Cenf Coffee.

New topic: Orchids to, those
members of Student Congress who
‘gave their hearty approval to the
eight-cent cup. A lot of moaning
and groaning plus a good deal of
newspaperspace has been devoted
in -the past few weeks to this sub-
ject, “the rise of the-cup of coffee.”
But still the price is stable, re-_
It

status here at the University if

as to rock the credit and banking

This is an affront which cries to
heaven for vengeance. These are
the times that try men’s souls.
Why stand ye here idle? Our
chains have been forged and their
clanking is now heard in the
streets of Soﬁa, Warsaw and

Lack of Quorum Hampers  

Student Congress Meeting  

No quorum and no action but plenty of talking marked the_.
Student Congress meeting last, Monday.

The lack of a quorum meant that a successor to

Pat Seger, who

resigned last week, could not be‘v‘ .

elected. With no quorum the
members present acted as a com-
mittee. , _ '
Several isues were discussed, the
ﬁrst of which was the failure‘ of
the Tea Dance last Friday. It went
$236.50 -‘ in the hole. Chairman
Larry Burwinkle wanted to know
why and what could be done to
prevent similar future ‘failures.
Reasons presented for the fail-
ure T centered -around the lack of

advertising. Another factor was

the increased: costof the‘ band, aci-
cording to William Saalbach, .as—
sistant to the dean of men. There

Students

Now Assigned Beats

Osarily have to be entirely from
beat stories. ~

Deans and heads of departments
have ‘ been contacted’ by Mr.
Graham and asked to cooperate
with the sixty students who have
been assigned weekly beats.

Not only will this enhance the
accuracy of department coverage
in the News, but» it should be a
valuable asset to the student in
reporting, Mr. Graham believes.

War Experiences In Germany
Pitt’s YWCA will open its ranks to membership next Tuesday

from 6 to 8 p. m. at the Metropolitan YW on Dithridge street
when Ilse Iltsch will discuss the work of the YWCA in Germany.

Miss Ultsch, area secretary ofe
the Young Women’s Christian As-
sociation in Hanerau, Germany,

has gone through many‘ stirring
experiences in Germany during’
the war.

Her work in the YW has re-
ﬂected the alliance of church and
the‘YWCA. Born and educated in
Munich, she became a theology
student. Upon graduation from
the University of Erlangen, she
took the examinations of the Lu-
theran-Church in Bavaria and be-
came -a “Vikarin”, this being the
title given women church work-
ers, some ofwhom perform the
duties of a man pastor.

Joining the YW in Munich in
1929, she gave Bible lessons in the
clubs and trained club leaders.
Later she spent a year in Bethel,‘
Westphalia, nursing epileptics for
the Inner Mission, a charitable
church organization. Duringthe
Hitler regime nurses and doctors
waged a constant battle to take
proper care of their charges in the
face of the government’s demand
that they be put to death, she re-.
vealed.

Miss Ultsch will tell the group
about her variousexperiences. -In
her honor, the meeting will be
Teutonic in nature with German
folk—songs and refreshments.

Electricity is transmitted in raging, siz-

be allowed to enter a home or factory. To
“housebreak” this hot stuff-—step it down
toward a useful 110 or 220-volt distribu-

The “skeleton” of each substation—the
framework of beams and girders that sup-
port the transformers and equipment—is
prey to weather, corrosive atmosphere,
clinging dirt. Good maintenance has
always called for frequent painting, arid

NEW PUBLICATIONS ADVISOR Paul Lohmeyer takes ltimeV,o,1_.'ii_
from his duties to smile for Pitt News photographer. Replacing Bill.
McElwain, Lohmeyer assumed his post when the fall semester began

Publications Aclvisor
Plans Improvements  

Any noticeable improvement
this year in the Pitt contributions
to American literature known as
the News, Owl, and Panther may

‘be ascribed by public opinion to

the new editors and their staffs——“-

but then youknow just how much
you can trust public opinion.

From his desk in the ﬁsh bowl
which he calls an office, Paul E.
Lohmeyer, new advisor to student
publications, announced that he
intends to ‘help make the publica-
tions better and of more interest
to the general student body, and
he sounded as though he meant it.

Mr. Lohmeyer is well—equipped
to guide the publications along
lines of student interest, since only
a few years ago he was a student
here himself—and quite a wheel at
that. '

His days on campus were di-
vided between the Pitt News and
a -sports program which included
three years of varsity basketball,
intramural football, and softball.
He worked up to the position of
associate editor of the ‘News.

While an undergradruate at the
University,_ Mr. Lohmeyer was
also honored as a Junior Worthy
and a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa. A

After graduating in 1943, he
served with the Army until 1945,
returning to Pitt asfan assistant
to the deaniof ‘men, and working
with the Veterans’ Administration
on‘ campus for two and a half
years.

He finished up his work there
Sept. 8, and began working with
publications Sept. 16, replacing
William McElwain, who was‘lost
to the Sun—Telegraph at the end
of the spring semester.

With his new position came also
the responsibility of teaching
classes in journalism, but he does

home in,Black'ridge, and

spends them. ‘ . - . .0 ff",

As far as his long rangefplarlé
for the Pitt News are concerned,
Mr. Lohmeyer is decided. In
days when he was associate »editoié_,
the News hit the‘ corridors tlirfefe
times a week, but was forced.

Out This Year

At a Student Congress meeting

5‘ Monday afternoon, it was decided

that a student demonstration block
would be .impossible to operate

‘ this year. 4

‘Last.year’s leader, Jack Finey,
boiled the issue to one short state-
ment. “The Student Congress ap-

_ propriation‘ for the block was not
‘large enough for the many ex-

penses required to renovate equip-

, .ment.’’

0 5 Students running the block last
year found a shortage of 200 blue
and gold capes after the ﬁnal

_gam_e.‘ A» seating capacity of 950
‘is needed for an impressive color-
' ful block.‘ ’

}_3‘_i_ney explained that the re-

— ﬁmaining 80-0 capes were in need

of cleaning. .

’ New color display cards, tacks,

ii" ‘paint, and perfect loud speaking

equipment are amo_ng other diffi-

T .culties’harrassing a good Saturday

demonstration. ‘ -
It was suggested by congress
that. the block be made into a

L school-approved and ﬁnanced stu-

dent _'act'ivity. ‘Keys plus recogni-
tion would be granted those stu-
dents _who joined such an organ-
ization.

First step in the University of
161/4—million dollar
building fund program has been
launched with publication of a
brochure which ‘tells a story of
University cooperation with busi-
ness. and industry in Western
Pennsylvania and beyond.

The brochure is designed to
show business and industry, which
will be asked for $6,200,000 for a
new science building and a new
library, that their present and fu-
ture advancement “is inﬁexibly
bound to the present and future
progress of the University of Pitts-
.burgh,”, according to Alan M.
Scaife, chairman of the executive
committee of the building fund
campaign.

Mr. Scaife explained that Pitt’s
building fund program ‘is divided
into three parts, and that funds
for the science building and the
library will be ‘raised’ as the ﬁrst
part‘. of the program. ‘

Second project wil be the Med-
ical Center, for which three build-
ings are planned — a Medical
School, a Clinical Wards and Clin-
ical Laboratories building to con-
nect the Medical School with Pres-
byterian Hospital, and a.School of
Nursing. Individuals and founda-
tions will be asked to. subscribe

' the $6,500,000 neded for the Med-

ical Center phase.

A new gymnasium, student cen-
ter, and ﬁeld house makeup the
third phase "of the program, total-
'ing.$3,550,000, and plans call for
the ﬁnancing of these units
through, a bond iss_L;e,,leaving a
total of $12,7~0-0,000 to beraised by

public subscription for the other
projects.

Of this amount, an al1011yp'10uS
gift of three million dollars has
already been pledged toward the
$6,500,000 needed for the Medical
Center, contingent upon the bal-

being raised.

The new science building will
be called George Hubbardgclapp
Hall and will house the Chemical
and Metallurgical Enginering de-
partments, as well as units of the
University’s Division of Research
in the Natural Sciences.

Together with the new library,
it will be erected on the Cathedral
of Learning Campus.
Headquarters for the building
fund campaign have been set up

brief outline of the University’s
over—all program, covering its
schools and’ divisions and the
“tangibles,” such as students, fac-
ulty, and curricula, through which
the program is carried out.

The ﬁnal pages of the brochure
are given over to the Pitt cyclo-
tron, which, together with
Westinghouse “atom smasher” and

the new cyclotron under construc-

tion-at Carnegie Tech, will help
the Pittsburgh district to make
signiﬁcant contributions to re-
search in induced radioactivity.
“Within a few years,” the book-
let concludes, “the harnessing of
atomic energy may become a vital
factor to industry. Thus Pitt’s
program of training students and
industry personnel as. far as such

training is possible under security .

regulations will be helping local
industry to keep pace with atomic
developments.”

Colorful new jerseys brought only misery to the Phi Epswhen
they were eclipsed, 12-6, by Delta" Tau Delta in a battle of undefeated
IM powers at Trees Field, last Friday afternoon.

Delt Bill Hawkins ﬁgured in two ﬁrst half touchdowns that gave

_the winners their edge.

He threw a ﬁrst quarter pass to Bill Webber for one TD, and
snareda second period aerial from the intrepid Bill Brehmfor the

A pass from Curly Weitz to
Mark Chernoff, who raced 40
yards behind excellent blocking,
accounted for the losers’ score in
the third quarter.

Another. Weitz to Chernoff aerial

‘penetrated to the Delt six in the

the last threat.

In" addition to his regular end

campaign last year. Under the
WPIAL system, however, the Bob- S,

for the Class A title playoff. _
Following the 1947 season, Chris
was awarded a coveted slot on the

All—WPIAL eleven. “’
He also received a further hon-

two All-star aggregations, placing '

him at one of the wing positions.
In this capacity, Warriner played .

Pitt’s cross country squad is looking for a crisp fall start when
