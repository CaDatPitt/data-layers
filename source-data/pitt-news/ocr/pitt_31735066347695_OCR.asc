Buildings Vanish “From Campus; Police Stumped

Bv SAM TOOTI-'IMONGE__R

In yet ' another disappearing
occurrence on the University of
Pittsburgh campus yesterday after-
noon, Hillman Library vanished. It
simply left with no warning. As
usual, there were no serious
students in the building. Some
sources have hinted there is a plot
underway to overtake the Univer-
sity and convert it into a large
corporation or a home for the
deranged.

The Chancellor issued a state-
ment:‘ “We are at quite a loss to
explain this inexplicable event, ” he
said.‘ “But we have complete
confidence that-Hillman cannot be
far off and will be located shortly.”

Philosophy professor Max Long
Beard, a Platonist who insists his
ofﬁce is on the hundredth story of
the Student Union, put forth the
hypothesis that since learning was

vigorously pursued in Hillman, then
perhaps students had reached such
a pinnacle of knowledge that
.Hillman had ascended into the
world of the Forms.

“Of course,” he mysteriously
added, “That is trtie only if our
assumption about the students is
correct.”

Several University bureaucrats
arrived on the scenewith long, red
tape measures. “According to our
computer cards,” one intimated,
‘ ‘the building is still there. We have
received no release forms signed by
the Dean or anyone else.”

After some intense measuring
the band of
bureaucrats sent a program report
to the Chancellor reporting that
according to all their records,
Hillman Library was still there.

The Chancellor searched his
“cabinet of Ready-Made Respon-
ses” and issued a new statement.
‘ ‘We are making real progress, ’ ’ he
said.  am pleased.”

Several protest movements
mounted. “I pay good money to
attend buildings,” one student
said. 

Another student, obviously an
intellectual or University Scholar,
said, “I would find it an extreme
metaphysical hardship to surmount
the impingement of having my
scholastic endeavor take place in an
invisible structure.”

Finally, the Chancellor took
decisive action. “I have ordered
Hillman Library‘ to reappear by

V tomorrow morning at the latest, ’ ’ he

said with ﬁnality. “These are not
those crazy days of the '60s, you
know.” The campus is expected to
be ' back to its normal rut by

Dunkin Donuts

By CARL MARXSTEIN
AND BOB WOODWORK

The University administration
announced tentative plans this
week to convert the site of the
recently destroyed Langley Hall
auditoriums to a Dunkin’ Donuts
restaurant.

In explanation of the ‘move, one
University official, who wished to
remain anonymous, said, “Well,
why not? There’s already a big hole
in the ground.”

Contracts for the projects have
not yet been finalized, although one
Dunkin’ Donut sales representa-
tive, Duncan Munchkin, reported
the proposed restaurant would cost
approximately $2 million. Accord-

ing to Munchkin, the University \

would foot the bill initially, but

could expect to generate enough‘

money to ﬁnance the project within
5 years of the opening.

“At least Dunkin’ Donuts will be
a money making proposition for the
University, unlike the lecture halls
that used to fill the site, ’ ’ Munchkin
said.

The Langley Hall auditoriums
were destroyed by a natural gas
blast in January of this year.

The Student Government Board
issued a statement yesterday

supporting the University’s plan to
build a Dunkin’ Donut. “Anything
to keep down tuition,” the letter
stated. ‘ ‘This will, in a non-political
way, help the University in its long
range goals to make money so we
don’t have to pay as much tuition.”

The letter also commended-the
administration for consulting with
the Student Government Board
before making the decision to

Not yet ﬁred sociology ‘professor
John Brown, a visiting professor

more problems than it solves.

“A whole new class system of
lower class laborers will stratify to

perform the. menial tasks associ-

ated with farming this plant," he
said. “People are needed who will
plant. harvest and process the fiber
cheaply. It will have to be a group

Brown suggested that University
of Pittsburgh graduate students
could transfer to those jobs
immediately with little hardship.

Posvar doesn't care

By AL A. GHENY

President Carter revealed today
that his nine-year-old daughter
Amy will attend the University of
Pittsburgh next September.

“It was a hard decision to make,
but we felt that Amy is as mature as
most Pitt students, having as much

. political and social conscience as the
best of them,’.’.. Carter said.

Pitt was chosen, Carter said, over
the President’s, alma mater, the
U.S. Naval Academy, as Amy failed
to meet Naval height requirements.

Some Ivy league colleges,
piqued by the presidential neglect
of their institutions, expressed
some dismay at the presidential
choice of the southwestern Penn-
sylvania university.

A Harvard University spokesman
said, “The Carter administration’s
egalitarianism is being pressed a bit

too far. Peanuts and the President’ s .

brother Billy we can endure, but Pitt
is intolerable.”

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
expressed his pleasure at Amy’s
forthcoming enrollment, saying it

proves that Pitt is not just interested
in building up its big league football
image.

’ “We are concerned. with the
quality of non-football students
entering our University. Amy will
undoubtedly be an asset to the
community and will give us the
beneﬁt of her unique perspective on
world and national events, ’ ’ Posvar
said.

The President declared Amy is to
receive no special University
privileges due to her familial ties.

“Chancellor Posvar and I have
had many conferences and have
decided no measures will be taken
other than to ensure Amy’s
security,” Carter said.

Professors unfavorable to the
Carter administration will be
subject only to nominal search and
seizure before. Amy’s classes,

Student Apathy Running

Rampant On Pitt 7

3,; ANN BY

A recent Pitt News poll of 800
Pitt students reinforced charges of
apathy on campus.

When asked “Who is Paul
Nyden?" 33 percent of the students
polled said he was the newifootball
coach, 27 percent said he was in
charge of the Avella archeological
digs, 22 percent said Nyden selects
the Golden Girls, 12 percent
offered no opinions and 6 percent
correctly identiﬁed Nyden as the
sociology professor denied tenure.
The opinions were gathered during
Nyden’s rally last Wednesday on
the ‘Cathedral lawn.

When asked why they were
attending the rally, 88 percent said
they came to hear the music.

.“I don't know who Nyden is, but
his back-up band is great,”
one bystander.

“Pitt students are not apathet-

brainwashed. 1 think it has

Read This Varnish Report

By TODD WHIPPERSNAPPERER

All Pitt dorm residents have been
asked by the University Housing
Office to temporarily relocate while
a coat of vamish-like varnish is
applied to all University living
areas.

The announcement came as an
unexpected surprise to Pitt stu-
dents. Many laughed, others cried
and wrote home to mom, some just
burped.

The varnish-like varnishing of the
walls was begun almost immediat-
ely and a number of students did not
have time to escape. Naturally,
they suffocated.

A few of these students were later
purchased by Carnegie Museum to
be used in displays.

Many of the relocated students
grouped and took counter action, a
new drug by R&R Phantasy Co.
“With counter-action, I don’t have
to worry,” quipped Laurie C.
Distraught. i

Some 3,000 students met in room
083 in Tower A to discuss relocating
among friends and peers. Most of
these students were not students at
all, but arare type of celestial bi-ped '
that thrives in telephone booths and
shower stalls.

According to Craven R. Altamira,
a freshman bi-ped majoring in the
study of lower vitamins found in
sewage, this varnish would make
things rough on people taking
woodshop. “After all, in woodshop
you practically drink varnish all day
and you practically die, unless you
are practically rushed to a
hospita .”

Shelob Adbul-Jabber, a spider
majoring in electrical engineering,
squealed these comments: “There
goes 10 months work on my web.’ ’

Some students staged a sit-in in
the office of an unknown assistant
sub-dean, who was so thrilled by the
attention he awoke and offered -
them crackers and old water.

We\Don’t Care

From time to time, it has been the place of this newspaper to
comment upon and sort out the assorted rubbish that fills this
University’s files of history.

 

For the most part, that has been a time-consumingsand thankless

task. That’s OK. we don’t mind. We praise ourselves enough
already, .

But it has come to our attention that some of you have been
complaining (privately, of course, since you don’t have the nerve to
confront us) about such things as ethics, coverage, bias, the size of
our classified section and our admitted hate for all of you.

Well, let’s set the record straight.

First, we hear complaints that we’re impersonal and aloof.
That’s possible._ But if we do step all over you, it’s not out of any
malice. It’s just that we don’t notice you. L

' And then, some say we misquote them. I Again, that’s "possible.
So what? Why, for every time we insert a “not” or a “yes, I admit
I hate Puerto Ricans,” that shouldn’t really be there, there are a
hundred times we changed your meaningless meanderings like

‘ “Hmmmmmm,” “Duhhhhhhhh,” and “Wait a minute while I ask

my secretarys” into coherent, human statements. Forgot so soon?
You lousy ingrates.

_..,.-But what’s more, you cut on us personally. That’s dirty pool,

even for rats like us. But if you want dirt,"we’ll give it to you. Like

what food service director secretly brings his lunch in his New York

a Times every morning? Huh? Thought we didn’t know?

, And what head football coach wears a leather jockstrap at
practice? And how about the physical plant director who is the

‘Y W beneficiary of the Benedum Hall insurance policy? Did we ever

spill those beans? Well? ,

And what chancellor and provost have been living together in the

Student Union Annex? And what med school dean sold his body to

tthe.Health Center for $50 and spent the next three weeks trying to
rub off the tatoo on his foot? Don’t believe us? We’ve got
pictures!

Not that we’d ever dream of naming names or divulging any
other details of our massive files on each and every one of you. But
we just want a fair shake. So, if you have a complaint, come up
and ‘see us. Alone. We, along with our good friends Kevin Cooper
and Barry Weisband, will make sure you don’t leave until you are
completely satisfied that we’re the best damned paper in the world,
let alone this damned campus.

By KENNEDY MATT '

With political and lunatic kidnap-
pings so much in vogue, many of
,'yo'u have written asking for
guidance as to the proper etiquette
to be observed on such sudden and

delicate occasions. I

Of course, the rich and famous
have been used to the whole thing
for many, many years, but there is
no reason why you have to show up
a social bore for simple lack of
experience.

 So, without further ado, some of
the inside tips on hostage etiquette
from the lips of the people who
really know...

THE INVITATION

Since most political or terrorist
kidnappings are quite impromptu,
invitation may be rather
informal. An old favorite is “One.
move and you're dead!” Of course,

. there may be a ﬂourish to, this

simple. andﬂelegant invitation such
as “one more move running dog
revisionist and you are dead!” or

- “One more move socialist ﬁend and

you are dead!” or “One more move
and I’ll blow your J ewish/ Irish/ ~
Sudanese/Bengali/East Coast pub-
lisher's head off!”

Don’t be ' put off by these
variations. It’s the first clue to a
rank novice. Learn to recognize an
invitation to a kidnapping and
respond quickly. Most RSVP’s will
give you only a few heartbeats and
you wouldn't want to be crossed off
the list, would you?

You can recognize a host
immediately. He will be armed and
dangerous and of course, the ﬁrst
tell-tale warning shots into the
ceiling should tip off even the rank
beginner.

The proper response is either to
raise your hands swiftly over your
head or to drop to the ﬂoor and lie
very still. Don’t keep your host
waiting. It is the heighth of poor
etiquette and a good way to get a
pistol-whipping.

THE DRESS

‘Once again, the informality of
kidnappings these days makes
these social gatherings come-as-
you-are. Because you never know
when or where you might be given
an invitation, it is considered smart
to keep a toothbrush, change of
underwear and some shaving
equipment near at hand. Fabulous
designers like Gucci are already on
the market with trim. sharp-looking

Not to belabor the point, but
thinking of the suddenness with
which these invitations are deliver-
ed, it would be considered smart to
go to bed fully dressed. One New
Jersey woman stepped outside for
the mail just last week in the
tackiest of shuffling terry-cloth
robes and wound up in Libya! It will
be sometime before the cocktail
circuit lets her live that one down!
When putting together your
hostage wardrobe, keep in mind you
will probably be on national
television. Informality doesn’t
mean you cast all good taste to the
wind. Blues in any range of shade
or pattern are best .for color
broadcasts. Television has a way of
making you look about 10 pounds
heavier, so slim down now.

    

Sneakers if you must, but only if
you can trust your friends not totalk
behind your back. Footwear is
especially important if you happen
to leave a kidnapping early.

CHIT CHAT

One of the biggest challenges of
being a good hostage is the chit chat
you will be involved in at the
particular affair- Because you never
know who will deliver the invitation,
it is wise to be conversant on a wide
range of political and psychological
topics. ’

Big on the hostage circuit this
season are French separatismand
Canadian repression, the struggle
of the Kepone People’s Republic of

Ancient Ape-Man
Dug Up On Atwood

By CLOVIS HOHOKAM

The University has announced
today that the anthropology depart-
ment has discovered a new missing
link. It was disclosed today by
University News and Publications
Director Mary Jane Dog, that
“Atwood Man” is a direct
descendant of the mutant species
Studentis locos.

Dr. Eccentric Digger described
this find as “totally arbitrary on our
part. Here we were walking out of
the local establishment, the Score,
when he just stumbled down at our
feet. .

“I believe that Atwood Man is
the culmination of the ﬁnal phase
of Oakland Man. He is
characterized as having extreme
prognathis of the upper brow and
lower jutting jaw. His cranium is

, shrunken almost to the point of

having a microscopic brain, but we
did locate it with our scientific
mini-scanner (supplied by the
Kelloggs Corporation).”

When quieried about the impor-
tance of such a find right in the
anthropology department's back-

yard. Digger replied that 7‘It is

unquestionably a boon to the
Oakland resident to know that he
can sleep, at night with the
knowledge that ‘Atwood Man’ is
safely held for observation in the.
department's back laboratory.

“There's no question that who
knows what might have happened
if we hadn’t come across him when
we did. Maybe he’d still be
hanging around Palmyrafs (Res-
taurant) asking for a quarter or a
cigarette. That can really scare the
living daylights out of you if it’s
nighttime."

The “Atwood Man" has no
intelligible means of communica-
tion with people except for an
occasional grunt or groan or
request for, in his own words, “A
cup of tea and a smashing good
novel to read by the fire with the
telly running low in the back-
ground.”

The facilities in the back lab are
some of the finest in the country for
observation_ of creatures of this
caliber. »With the expansion and
addition of new quarters at the
Forbes Quadrangle, soon derelicts
from all over the country will be
shipped to the -famed facilities.

Past Pitt Prof Dogged

By INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU ‘

The FBI, CIA and National Guard
have been mobilized, by order of the
President, in a frantic effort to
capture Hegel the philosopher-dog,
former professor of astrophysics
and philosophy here at Pitt.

The dog-hunt began shortly after
Hegel was ﬁred from his post on the
Pitt News, at which time he
reportedly went berserk.

“I hate the living guts of anybody
who has anything to do with any

newspaper,’ ’ a colleague heard him
growl after he got the boot. “I’m
going to kill them all, booohoow-
ahahah!”

Literally thousands of Pitt News’
were found the following day,
soaked with a suspicious foul-
smelling yellow liquid. After
conducting a series of thorough
tests, Pitt chemists announced “It
smells like someone took a leak on
them.”

disclosed he received a threatening

think you got problems?” are
considered the worst of bad taste
and you certainly don’t want to eat
lead. Remember that your host will
be under pressure. Especially if
he/ she is hosting 32 people with
nothing more than a sten gun or the
ever-popular grenade. Would you
want your guests acting up?

The ﬁrst rule of hostage chit chat,
above and beyond a simple
conversational knowledge, is. to‘
agree with everything the host says.
Of course, you might be gagged,
but that doesn’t mean you can’t nod
very sincerely. Practice sympath-
etic shrugging, grunting and eye
movements in the mirror; they will

prove invaluable and, who knows, .

you might be invited back again
sometime.

SOME GENERAL TIPS

Don’t make the mistake of.
thinking that the hostage scene is-

not your bag, that you never travel
in those circles or that kidnap crowd
is out of your sphere. The point is

that you have no choice and

following simple, rudimentary eti-
quette can make all the difference

between an Entebbe or a dull, A

‘drawn-out social bomb.

Do accept gagging, roping or if

handcuffing graciously. Don’t
make comments about the_knots,
the quality of rope, etc. Do have a
few ready comments about the
nasty police. Don’t mention your
uncle who is an FBI man.~ Do
mention you gave the Untied Way.
Don’t mention you work in a B-1
bomber plant. Do suggest you’ve
always admired crazy, desperate
killers.

IN PASSING

While kidnapping has yet to
.receive the place of the football
weekend or the Las Vegas
overnighter, the popularity of these
last-minute get-togethers is spread-
mg.

Take the opportunity, since you
have little say in the matter, to meet
new friends and broaden your social
contacts. Friendships formed at
these little gatherings have a way of

~ lasting and it's often a good way“ to

meet the best sort of people. The
kidnapping has a way of breaking
the ice like no other social event,
which probably accounts for its
increasing occurrence in our
society, which was lost touch with so
many of the other reﬁned means of
mixing with new, interestingjjand
jpsychotic people. 
Finally, you really ought toithink
seriously about having your own
little kidnapping. Remember, it
"doesn’t have to be a special
obcasion. Anything will do. An IRS
audit, a parking ticket, an unhappy
love life or just one of those dreary
rainy days that could, well, drive a
person crazy. Don’t be shy, we’ll
give you all the help you need.

Baylson mentioned that although

Hubbard blamed the dilemma on

No one cares about rock ’n roll.
No one cares about anything. That’s
why I’m writing this album review.
Enough with my personal philos-
ophy, so let’s get on with the review
part.

This LP is really standard, as far
as LPs go. It is your basic blackwith
all the trimmings of a really artistic
label and spaces in between the
songs. Between-track-time, as we
reviewers like to call it, varies from
LP to LP but the really big ones
usually include a common 10

probably ﬁnd that ‘ ‘Mommy’ ’ fits in
well with the mean of 10 inches.
Since black is a must for all albums,
the more colorful an inside label is
the bigger the sale of the disk, even
though one doesn't get to see the
label till one buys it.

“Mommy” has been blessed
with one of the few good
measurements for an LP cover to

dimensions—12 and 1/4 inches

couple of Grammys, might even.

all too radical 25 x 25 design which is
much too bulky for fans to tote home
from their local distributor.

On the inside are contained all of
the goodies, especially the label
pasted on the record itself. The
Little Cents proved to have little

sense in its choice of a colorful
pastiche of childlike scrawls from
elementary school. This also proves
that the name of the group states its
current ﬁnancial condition.

The grade-school motif is contin-
ued on the outside jacket as the
crayon marks are so real that they
can almost stain your sweaty palms.
Bright greens, purples and yellows
run all over the place. Nowhere is
there a photo of the little known
group who cut this LP (Thank God).

As for the tracks on the album,
you’ll have to be the judge of those
yourself. I got so wrapped up in the
more fascinating aspects of the LP
that I completely forgot to listen to
the songs. You’ve probably heard it

After months of infighting, the SGB was able to find an obscuregroup, the

petered out and the rest were quick

and fun and excitement was had by all.

The game was rollercard, a futuristic versionof pinochle played by a
six member team outﬁtted with roller skates, inner tubes and hockey

sticks.

They sk_ated around the indoor track at the Fitzgerald Field House in
groups of three, ﬁghting for the cards dealt randomly into the center of
the track. When hands were established-they bid according to meld

points.

When it came time to take tricks, if a player. could not follow suit, he

had the choice of trumping his
opponent or hitting him over the
head with the hockey stick. When

\ meld and trick points were totalled,
if a team did not make bid, they
were penalized with a crack to the
cranium.

To win, a team had to bid at 120,
ﬂoat out at 150 or pass out at the
side’ of the track. No substitutions
were allowed.

Alexander Hospitalized

By MYRON COPOUT

Robert Alexander, West Virginia
University’s blue chip football
recruit, is resting comfortably in a
Morgantown hospital today after
his head blew up last night.

Alexander's surgeon and long-
friend, Dr. Con Seat, attributed the
explosion to a rare gridiron disease
known as Tonyitis, which was
compounded by self-proclaimed
greatness. ‘

“His head just got too big for his
body," Seat said of the South
Charleston High school running
back. “Robert's self-conﬁdence
simply got out of hand."

Witnesses said they noticed
Alexander kicking pebbles along
the street outside Mountaineer
Field at about 7:33 p.m., approxi-
mately 33 minutes before the

explosion took place. People
present overheard the much-
sought-after athlete talking to
himself.

"‘He was mumbling something
about the 1978 Heisman Trophy,”
a witnesssaid.

One WVU student, who identi-
ﬁed himself as Paul Peesh, said he
saw Alexander pull a crayon from
his »tube sock and ‘scribble
“Alexander the Great was here”
on the stadium wall just before the
future Mountaineer went berserk.

“It was crazy," Peesh said.
“The guy pulled out this voodoo
doll and started sticking pins in it.
Icouldn't believe my eyes. He had
the thing dressed in a blue
tear-away jersey with the number
‘.13’ on it."

According to Peesh, Alexander
suddenly threw the doll to the

ground and began jumping up and
down on it, repeatedly shouting
“Tony Dorsett" at the top of his
lungs. A

“His head was getting-bigger
and bigger,” Peesh said, “and on
the 33rd ‘-sett’.it just blew.”

Dr. Seat said Alexander’s head
had been expanding ever since
national letter of intent day on Feb.
16. but explained that his patient
had contracted the disease long
before that.

“It's something that's been
building up inside of Robert for
about six months," Seat said.
“His condition's gotten progres-
sively worse ever since Dorsett had
that I99-yard day against the
Mountaineers back in November."

In a related announcement,
Posvar expressed a desire to avoid
any scheduling conﬂict with the
Steelers in Three Rivers Stadium.
Therefore, the University has made
plans to begin destruction of the
Law Building on Forbes Avenue
and will soon commence construc-
tion of a badly-needed A new
stadium.

Small sports are not left out in
this reorganization of Pitt athletics.
Athletic Director Casimir Myslin-
ski unveiled plans to place a dome
over Trees Hall and turn it into
“the most exotic practice ﬁeld in
civilization.” .

All the equipment, personnel
and ofﬁces displaced by “Myslin-
ski Hall” will be housed on the ﬁfth
floor of the Cathedral, soon to be
vacated by the English Depart-
ment. Pitt Stadium will
re-named the “Soccer Pit” and will
house all the outdoor activities of
Pitt's minor sports.

Myslinski to Michigan;
Best for Both Schools

By SARUMAN

Pitt Athletic Director Casimir J.
Myslinski was traded to the
University of Michigan yesterday,
according to a statement issued by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. ,

“It’s going to work out a lot
better for ‘everyone concerned,"
Posvar said. “Cas did a fantastic
job. He brought the football
program up from nothing to the
national championship and he's
leaving us just as he found us."

Posvar declined to discuss the
monetary compensations for the
trade, saying only that “Michigan
drives a hard bargain." However,
sources at the Sports Information
Ofﬁce said that Pitt will receive
three of Michigan's top high school
recruits. Ofﬁcials from Michigan

refused to comment on what they
are receiving in the reported
“package deal.” »

Myslinski is taking his ofﬁce
furniture and 7 bodyguards with
him to his new job.

‘‘I was really shocked to hear
that I was being traded,” he said in
a phone interview, “but the
compensations are fantastic. I’ve
got the rights to a story in Sports
Illustrated on the Majors‘ years at
Pitt, a copy of the Sugar Bowl
trophy and a substantial cash

ettlement."

‘Also, Posvar announced plans
for a statue of Myslinski to be
placed near the goal posts in Pitt
stadium. It will be paid for by
student activitiy fees.

“It's the least we can do,”
Posvar said. ‘ “This is the end of an

WRITTEN; I’ve been thinking quite a
bit about things, and I think it’s a
damn shame things turned out the
way they did. it’s like something or
someone neither of us had any control
over just drove a wedge between us. I
loved you then, I love you now, and I
don’t understand. But enough of that.
Law school isn’t as tough as people
say, but those Yale-types are getting
to me. Real stuck on themselves. I
can’t really say |’ve met anyone who
I’d consider a good friend. These
obsessive-compulsive, over-achieving,
bookworms make poor company. I’d
like to see you again. I’m sending you
a plane ticket. I know you hate
accepting my gifts, but I have money
and I can’t think of any way I’d rather
spend it. Please think about it. Just

I’ll meet you at the airport. Weekends

lineup next fall, but “he will have
to open the season at a lighter
weight than expected.” ~

With all that added head weight

gone, Seat explained. Alexander's»

I85-pound frame is a thing of the
past. .

“Robert's down to 152, which is
a loss of 33 pounds," Seat said with
an air of concern. “That’s a lighter
weight than what Dorsett started
out at."

Although Seat spent over 33
minutes in the operating room
re-piecing Alexander's head with a
half-roll of masking tape, he

refused to take total credit for the
operation’s success.

“If it weren't for Coach (Frank)
Cignetti’s efforts, I’d hate to think

where we’d be right now,” Seat,

said. "He sacrificed his entire
night by scanning the explosion
site, picking up the scattered
pieces of Robert's head with only
the aid of a flashlight."
Reporters tried desperately to
get a comment from Cignetti in the
hospital waiting room, but the
coach merely sat with his head in
his hands and his elbows resting on
his lap, mumbling something about

a national championship and a ,

drain.

Richard Nixon Denies

Watergate

T (Continued from Page 2)
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who
broke the Watergate story, Nixon
said it was a prime example of the
press trying to “play G_od.”

‘ ‘I have my own conscience. Who
needs them messing around? I’m
sick of Woodward and Bernstein
being called heroes. They were just
after a fast buck. They even got two
books out of me. Plus that movie.

Well, at least it didn’t get the
Academy Award. I’m even happy to
see it go to that film about the Dago
boxer rather than a pack of lies like
“All the President’s Men,” Nixon
said.

Following the lecture, Nixon was
the guest of honor at a brunch held
at McDonald’s where Pitt students
were able to have informal
conversations with the former
President. ‘ \

Knowledge

‘ ‘Right now, I’m checking out the
scene, so to speak, and trying to
drum up support,” Nixon said over
an Egg McMuff1n. “I want to run
for the senate in ’78 and revive my
political career. And then it’s only a .
jump until 1984.”
