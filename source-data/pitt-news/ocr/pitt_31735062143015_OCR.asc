There’ll be no vacations for
the engineers this summer.
Oﬂicial announcement was
made early this week that all
students in the School of Engi-
neering and Mines will be re-
quired to attend aspecial 12-
week summer session to main-
N tain active status on the
School’s rosters.

Long Sought Revisions

(See Page 2 for Chart) N
I Weather permitting, the Schenley Park Plaza parking area
will have its face lifted this weekend.
City workmen will spend tomorrow and Sunday painting

it-white and yellow lines over the area to provide an entirely

new parking arrangement. Whi.le the work is being done the
Plaza will be closed to parking.

Should rain interfere, the two-¢

day job may extend into the ear-
ly part of next week. When it is
ﬁnished, an additional 5-0 to 100
cars may be accommodated.

The new system should put an
end to the sad stories of students
who wanted to go home after sec-
ond hour, only to ﬁnd their cars
—parked in the Plaza’s inner cir-
cle -— hopelessly hemmed in un-
til noon or later by the outer ring
of autos.

The city’s action is the result
of a letter last semester from Stu-
dent congress'to City Traiﬁc En-
gineer Donald (McNeill. Congress
at that time asked McNeill to do
something to_ relieve the ever-
growing congestion in the Plaza
parking area.

Mr. McNeill notiﬁed Congress
shortly afterward that the prob-
lem was being studied" and as-
signed Charles S. Cunningham,
traffic planner, to draw up a pro-
posed parking plan.

After several weeks of propos-
als and counter-proposals by the
city and the University as to how
the plan might best be adminis-
tered, McNeill ﬁnally agreed Wed-
nesday to have the area lined, on
the condition that the University
accept responsibility for educat-

ing students and faculty to the
proper use of the new system.

“Daytime parking in the oak-
land area,” McNeill said, “is chief-
ly a University problem, and un-
less Pitt people will cooperate on
this plan there is no point in the
city spending several’ hundred
dollars to paint in the lines.”

To help accustom drivers to the
new setup, two patrolmen,. paid
by the University, will be on hand
every day but Saturday for the
ﬁrst two weeks after the painting
is ﬁnished. A single patrolman
will supervise the parking a third
week and, if necessary, a fourth
week. By that time, it is expect-
ed that further active supervision
will be unnecessary.

The number of cars in the Plaza
proper will be 206, just a few
morejthan can be parked there
now, but the new system will per-
mit constant access to the park-
ing stalls. Each parking space will
be outlined in white and the no-
parking areas in yellow. Revision
of parking arrangements in other
sections of the Plaza area will al-
low for the parking of a minimum
of 77 cars.

Auer and Bonnie. Baker share

the intermission spotlight with Freddy Schaeﬂer and his all-
girl orchestra to round out an evening of dancing and enter-
tainment. Bonnie Baker will be remembered for her “Oh ,

Tickets for the ball at $3.510 per
couple, will be hawked Wednes-
day, April 21, according to, the
festival committee. Price of tick-
ets at the door will jump to $4.

but under the exceptional circum
stances of a dance of this type,
Festival committee members pe-
titioned Student congress to ex-
tend the hour until 1 a. m. Con-
gress’ social committee approved
the recommendation this week. It
has been submitted to University
authorities for ﬁnal approval.
The grand ball is an open dance.
Students who plan to wind up the
hectic four days of Spring festi-
val at the dance can bring as
many guests as they wish.
Present plans of the festival
committee, headed by Luicelle

, Zuerner and Bob Griewahn, call

for decoration of the entire barn-
sized Armory in a bizarre Spring
festival cartoon motif. The dec-
orations project will be handled
by outside ﬁrms on a contract
basis.

Krupa’s decision to play for the
grand ball came this week, and
the contract has been signed, seal-
ed, and delivered. On the.pro—
gram besides the heat-beat of
Krupa’s drum, will be the soft
swing that Krupa recognizes as
wanted by college students. There
will be no more than one jazz
number in any dance series.

instead.

This ﬁrst Military Ball since
the war is scheduled for Satur-
day, May 24, in the Syria Mosqu_e

Members of ‘Men’s Debatehold their heads high and well.

they may.

Four student orators returned Sunday from the National

Forensic tournament at Mary Washington college in Virginia

with the two highest awards offeredin competition with 84
teams representing 49 colleges from ‘all over the United States,

Although both the affirmative and, negative teams Won

seven of their eight debates, the-¢

grand national award went to
the “yes men” on points while the
Pitt dissenters claimed a close sec-
ond place. '

Success in the national compe-

'tition climaxed months of deep

thought and strong talk as Men’s

‘Debate moved from a hasty re-

organization in November to the
national championship in April.
"The forensic society hadlpbeen
inactive for more than a year
when the 20 male students staged
a‘ comeback and began to air their
views under the direction of Ben-
jamin Elkins, an instructor at
Munhall high school.
a After sponsoring a district high
school debate on Dec. 14, the de-
baters turned to the radio as a
means of expression. In collabora-
tion with the other Pittsburgh
colleges, Men’s Debate supplies a

speaker for the bi-weekly School

of the ‘Air over ”W.IAS.

Every Tuesday evening a mem-
ber of the ‘club proffers his opin-
ion on a current national or civic
issue on the University Soap Box

of the Air sponsored jointly by

station WWSW and the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

During ‘mid-semester vacation,
Men’s Debate entertained members
of the Princeton debate team and
the following week left for an

eastern tour highlighted by non-

decision verbal bouts with Rutgers,
Penn State, and Temple.

After participating in a tourna-
ment at Kent State Teachers col-
lege in Ohio on Feb. 17, the Pitt
orators came home to win ﬁrst
place in the Mount Mercy tour-
nament on Feb. 22. Edging out
the Penn State affirmatives, the

Pitt negatives were the only team

at the Mount Mercy tournament
to win all four of its debates.

Last Saturdiay’s national triumph
brought Men’s Debate its ﬁrst not-
able victory since the Bowling‘
Green tournament in the spring
of 1945 when the Pitt orators
placed ﬁrst in ‘competition with
eastern colleges.

In the ﬁnal round of last Week’s
three—day tournament, the affir-
mative team of Tom Skifﬁngton
and David Rhodes defeated Penn
State while the negative team of
Dick Hazley and Jack Gilbert took
the decision from the University

of Chicago debaters.

of Women’s Day, a Pitt tradition
abandoned during the war.

Traditions chairman Betty Mal-

moor of the reception. Peggy
Hurrel and Jean Stickle are head
ushers.— Publicity directors are
Haddie Nixon and Audrey Lang-

In addition to the installation,
Women’s Day includes a nation-
ally—known guest speaker and a
reception in the social room of
Foster memorial. In the receiv-
ing line will be prominent Pitts-
burgh women, invited as honor
guests.

The entire project is being
supported by contributions from
all Women’s organizations on cam-
pus. ’

“The response to WSGA’s re-
quest for funds for Women’s Day
was most gratifying. In fact, Uni-
versity oﬁicials were so impressed
by the enthusiasm of women stu-

Frats Meet Faculty ‘
In Open House Session

The doors on Pitt’s fraternity row will be thrownopen Sunday ‘

afternoon for all faculty members of the University.‘

Sponsored by Interfraternity council, each of the 15 fraternities
will participlate in the event. Those fraternities without houses have
been invited to share the six active fraternity houses for the after-

I100l'1.

Although this‘ is the first time this event has been on campus,

tentative plans call for perpetua-
tion of the Interfrat—Faculty Open
House as an annual affair.

Purpose of the reception is to
“ﬁll the void that exists between
fraternities and the faculty and
administration.”

Edward Ray, Alpha Phi Alpha,
director of the entire program,
extended a cordial welcome to all
members of the faculty and the
administration, ' “especially those
who did not receive personal in-
vitations because they were not
listed in last year’s Faculty di-
rectory.”

Research Problems in the Manufacture of Nylon

Last month in this space the develop-
ment of nylon was traced from a funda-
mental research study on linear polymers
to the ﬁrst synthetic organic ﬁbers, the
superpolyamides. This installment deals
with the complex manufacturing re-
search problems that followed.

_ From the start there were obstacles
to the production on a commercial scale
of the,“66” polymer—so named because
the adipic acid and heXamethylenedia-
mine from which it is made have six

carbon atoms each.

Although adipic acid was being pro-
duced in Germany, it was necessary to
develop a new process to meet conditions
at Du Pont’s Belle,W.Va., plant, where,
because of the catalytic technique in-
volved, it was decided to make this
intermediate. _Hexamethylenediamine

was only a laboratory curiosity, and a

process for its commercial production
had likewise to be worked out. Fortu-
nately it was found that the diamine
could be made from adipic acid by new
catalytic processes. The results of these

investigations may be summarized as

follows:

only part of the problem. Nylon poly-
mer was an entirely new material with
properties different from any previous
synthetic product. It provided the ﬁrst
example of spinning ﬁber from a molten
polymer (m.p.263°C) and required en-
tirely different techniques from rayon

molecular weight and viscosity. A long-
chain linear polymer is formed with a
molecular weight of 10,000 or higher.

The melt is converted to solid chips
that are later re—melted and extruded
through a spinneret to form ﬁlaments
at a speed of 2,500 feet a minute. The
ﬁlaments are then drawn out to about
four times their original length in order
to develop the desired textile qualities
characteristic of nylon.

These operations sound simple
enough, but some of the problems en-
countered were extraordinarily diﬂicult-
For example, a specially designed grid
for melting the polymer was necessary
because of the poor thermal conductiv-
ity of the polymer; pumps had to oper-
ate at 285°C with only polymer as a
lubricant; special abrasion-resistant:
steels that did not soften or warp at
285°C were necessary; the spinning as-
sembling required radically new engi-
neering developments to produce the
necessary ﬁber qualities. ”

mechanical engineering problems had

‘Rutgers Press

Republishes »

Bowman Book

Dr. John G. Bowman, presi-
dent of the university and author,
has written a book, The World
That Was, a story written about
his , own childhood “for 1 anyone
who was ever a child and particu-

larly for those who think they.

don’t have time to‘ remember.”

First printed in 1926 by Mac-
Millan company, the book was re-
printed by demand this year by
Rutgers university press.

Shows Three Inﬂuences

The story shows three influenc-
es marking Dr. Bowman’s early
life-his relationship with nature,
his father, an.d his deep apprecia-
tionof poetry.

Dr. Bowman uses unusual
phrases to describe his youthful
experiences. In describing his at-
titude toward life then, he de-
ﬁnes the word “lazy” as it was ap-
plied to him by his family, in
saying “all day with a doorstep
and a string or with a mouse or
an ant hill was the same as be-
ing lazy.” When he sits reading
alone in his home he looks about
him and says “we never had so
much stillness in our house be-
fore.”

Dr. Bowman seems to feel that
there are rare, memorable mo-
ments in living when man ap-
proaches God. He says, “Poets
Were, of all people, most like
God.” He has said that his great
aspiration as a child was to be a
poet, since he felt these spiritual
inspirations asa result of his as-
sociations with nature and his
father.

Discovers Beauty of Music

The passage describing his ﬁrst
realization of beauty in music il-
lustrates inspiration clearly and
concretely. He is playing the ﬂute
and his music teacher, Mr. Peter-
son, joins in, playing the violin.
The two play, and as Dr. Bow-
man describes it, “it was pure
sadness passing by, -lifting me up
. . . to a kind of glory of which
poetry at its best had only hint-
ed.”

Dr. Bowman, chancellor of the
University until 1945, has writ-
ten another book, of children’s

verse, which was published by
the Volland company.

Horse Chase, Ex- Grid Star, Praises
Carlson ’s ‘Patience To Coach Me’

Carlson for quite a number of
reasons but the primary one is
“for having enough patience in
trying to coach me for basket-
ball and football.”

“Horse”, as he was known dur-
ing his years at Pitt, was one of
the ‘many former Panther athletes
who gathered in Pittsburgh re-
cently to honor his former coach,
“Doc” Carlson. The occasion was
a testimonial banquet celebrating
the Doctor’s 25th year of tutoring
Pitt athletes.

An all-around’ player while at
Pitt, Horse earned varsity em-
blems in football, basketball, and
baseball. ,

Football His Game
Football was probably the
I-Iorse’s specialty, particularly in
1925. That year he captained the
Panthers and was selected as a
tackle on the 1925 all-American
eleven. A
Chase was dubbed “the spread-
eagle tackle” by Philadelphia
sports writers who viewed the
1925 Pitt-Penn State game. For
60 minutes that day the Panther
line seemed to be all Chase’s.
breaking up Nittany’s , plays all
over the ﬁeld and pile-driving
holes in the State line so his mates
could roar through for long gains.
~ Two years earlier, against the
same school, the Horse played in
“his most thrilling game”. That
year Pitt came into the fray with
Rose Bowl-bound State, ‘gunning
for an ‘upset. And upset them they
did, 21-3. ‘

Blocks Kick With Face

The deciding factor in the game
was a blocked kick, Ralph Chase’s
face the obstacle in the pigskin’s
path. The loose ball bobbed into
the Lion’s end zone. Pitt’s Milo
Gwosden falling on it for a Pan-
ther touchdown.

Commenting on that play after
the game, Horse muttered, “Gwos-
den got all the credit, all I got was
a black eye.” - I

“Doc” Carlson drilled the fresh-
man football team when Chase
was in school. Horse remembers
the Syracuse game well. At the
half it was 0-0. Inthe dressing
room, Carlson and one of Horse’s
teammates, Wendel Steele, had a
little discussion.

Ralph Chase‘ admires Dr. H. C.¢

Steele moaned, “Those oflicialsv

won’t give us anything.” To which
the Doctor grunted, “Won’t give
you anything? I’ll give you some-

thing-a sock on the nose.”
Court Ace As Well

Ralph starred on the Panther
basketball team, too. His inspira-
tion came from the dollars the
ﬁery Carlson gave him for each
basket he made.

The amiable Chase is head foot-
ball and basketball mentor at
Drexel‘ Institute in Philadelphia.
He has also found time to pen ﬁve
books. " '

Although he doesn’t coach it,
Chase added a lot of color to base-
ball as a ﬁrst-sacker. One day,
acting on an impulse, the Horse
parked on the initial hassock in-
tead of at the usual ﬁrst-base-
man’s position.

The batter lined the ﬁrst pitch
right into his glove. .Retiring to
the bench, the hitter muttered,
“You would never have caught
that danged ball if you’d been
playing your position.” Chase re-

torted ca~lmly,“‘I always play the
batter.” '

Pitt Wins *YMCA  

Basketball Crown

With their star Tony Razzano
sidelined in the last quarter be-
cause of ﬁve personals, the Pitt
Y, defeated Allegheny YMCA
53-47, at East Liberty, Wednes-
day evening. Thisgives the Pitt
team an undisputed claim to the
Metropolitan YMCA league cham-
pionship. ~ X

The Pitt ﬁve, accused of being a
one-man team by some fans, won
the game without the aid of Raz-
zano in the c-rucial ‘last quarter.
Razzano was watched closely all

scoring with 13 points.

Marty Rosepink was the real
star of the championship game.
His accurate shooting in the
pinches, which netted him 11
points, kept the Pitt team ahead.
He was cast in an iron-man role,

..p._l.aying the entire game.

The Pitt team was composed of
Tony Razzano, Leo Skladany,
Marty Rosepink, J oh'n .'iosh, Ed

i McConnell, Jim Gallagher, Ray

many yarns with Ed Latagliata A

night but nevertheless‘ led all Pitt ,

Keenan, and Bob Schumaker.

Tech Champ

ions, 39-34+

Beta Theta Pi, Tech’s intramural basketball champion, was
outclassed, 39-34,; by Pitt’s Douglas Phys Ed club, Tuesday
night at the Skibo gym.‘The Beta ’s were good shots and sound
in» their fundamentals, but the Douglas boys had a monopoly

on class.

.w

Bill Morton and big Red Graham were the big guns of the

Pitt team. Time and again, Gra-9
‘hams drove, head down, through

the opposition zone’ defe , and
whenthe points were add cl, Mr.
Graham was found to have gar-
nered 18 markers. ’

Plenty of excitement was fur-
nished in the second period when
the lead changed hands ﬁve times,
Douglas ‘ﬁnally coming out with
a 146-15 -edge at half-time.

’ From there on in, however, the
Tech team provided little power
in the way of a threat, as the
Douglas club stretched their 16-15
lead into a 26-15 margin before
thelopposition was able to s-core.

Apparently Douglas had found

‘ the key that opened the sliding

zone defensé which had, in the
first half, caused] them much an-
noyance. Quick, deliberate passes
were whipped around in the back
court. ,

Phillips, Waseko, and Wolfe,
ﬁnally worked the ball through
the zone to Morton or Graham

or who promptly sank the lay—ups.

.Constantly in the hair of the

Douglas, boys was Vince Prus. ,On

several occasions when the Beta’s
were sagging badly Prus came
through with‘ a much needed ﬁeld
goal, giving his teammates new
life.

But in the ﬁnal analysis, Doug-
las had too much ﬁnesse for the
Tech intramural champs.

Veteran Stars
Spark Spring
Grid Drills

After several weeks of condi-
tioning, Coach Mike Milligan and
his staff have begun weeding out
the candidates in drills at the
hilltop practice ﬁeld above Pitt
stadium.

‘Competition is exceptionally
keen among the candidates. Out-
standing guards are Bill Coury,
Arnold, Johnny Kosh, Donora,
and Bernie Barkouskie, Kulp-
rnont, who alternated at the guard
posts last year and continue to
show plenty of drive and ﬁght. .
‘ Of the new guard candidates,
Tony Razzano, New Castle, will
probably be the biggest threat in
his efforts to capture a starting
berth. Although ‘weighing only
175, Razzana ‘ sports plenty of
speed and ﬁght.

Earl -Sumpter, Clairton, and
Robert Hahner, Mt. Lebanon are
two more guard candidates who
show promise. Sumpter, former
all-WPIAL lineman,’ was con-
verted from center.

Lee Ward, returning center who
had knee trouble last year, leads
the list of candidates seeking the
middle spot of the line. Sam Had-
dad and Ralph Short,” converted
quarterback from the Fesler-
coached squad, round out the list
of leading center candidates.

All-around backﬁeld man, Bill
Bruno, Penn, was moved again.

the singleiwing formation. Other
men changed to quarterbacks in-
clude: William Hardesty, Langley,
Pete‘ Fuderich, Aliquippa " and

Charles Underdonk, V Moundsville.

Intramural All-Star
-Selected   by Weekes

Intramural sports director George Weekes has nominated
his annual all-IM team which he claims: “Would give Carlson ’sV
gang 9. run for their money.”

Holding down the forward posts are J ohmiy Gallagher of
PiKA and Ed Burns of the Psi Os, dental frat. The- center
pivot man is Bill Morton, phys ed student. Tom Sheeran and
Elwyn Stewart, -who round out the squad at guard positions,
represent the Law School and the Dental Frosh, respectively.

Mr. Weekes was asked to se—, 
lect these teams, since he is
in the best position to compare
the player’s performances. As
director of the basketball tour-
ney, he has viewed each team
in competition at least once
during the long winter season.

This telephone strike hit Izzy
Mercurio right where it hurts.
His marathon calls to McKeesport
are completely kaput now.

Joe Platner has already sent in
his application for the French
Foreign Legion. You’ll have to

his ﬁrst date in seven months, that

Ralph Wilde and Betty Rank are

happened to Russ Ferguson and

A certain Pitt man, who isn’t
anonymous though he is alcoholic,
is having a tough time retrieving
his pin, which he gave away
awhile ago in a fit of something
or other. Guess he doesn’t real-
ize that a frat pin is a sacred
thing, not to be used in augment-
ing a sales talk.

Due to spring football training
rules, Harry Fabry is not allowed

A Dance Tickets

To Be Printed
As Subpoenas

Pitt students in the Law School
will dance with their dates and
their wives at the Eiarristers’ Ball,
scheduled for the South Hills
Country club this evening from 9
p. m. to 1 a. In. Joey Sims’ or-
chestra is supplying the music.

For their ﬁrst Law School dance
since before the war, the commit-
tee is limiting the number of
tickets to 150. Students in the
Law School can purchase tickets
on the fourteenth floor today.

The price of tickets has been
set at $3 per couple, according to
committee member Hal Gondel-
man. In keeping with the spirit of
the school, tickets are being is-
sued in the form of subpoenas.
The dance is informal, with the
“no Corsage” ruling in effect.

Besides Hal Gondelman, com-
mittee members working on the
dance include Bill King, Owney
McManus, Roy Reymer, Len
Greenwald, and Charles Starr.

This year’s Barristers’ Ball is
sponsored by Phi Alpha Delta,
Phi Delta Phi, and Tau Epsilon
Rho, professional law fraternities
at Pitt.

Festival
(Continued from Page 1)

Most leaders have been con-
demned for their lack of person-
ality and stage presence, but
Gene, whose recorded and radio
music ranks with the ﬁnest in the
land, is superlative on the stage.
Curiously enough the drummer
makes no particular effort to be
a showman, it just comes natural
to him. .

Paul Steinlauf, chairman of the
grand Ball, and Bill Zefﬁro, busi-
ness manager, heaved a sigh of
relief upon ﬁnal signing of the
contract.

“The gang has been looking
for a good band,” said Steinlauf,
“and we made every effort pos-
sible to secure Gene Krupa for
Spring Festival.”
