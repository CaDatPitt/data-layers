SGB Recommends Increase In Student Activities Feed

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staffwriter

An increase in the current $12
student activites fee was recom-
mended to members of the
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee yesterday by Student Govern-
ment Board member Todd Park.

Park said that in light of the
climbing rate of inﬂation and the
university’s decreasing enrollment
he believed an increase in the fee is
necessary. Park added that most
students are not aware of how

Study Calls
For Closing
Titusville

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

A preliminary study of Pitt’s
Titusville campus indicates that
school may be closed in the future,
according to Dr. Robert Nossen,
associate provost of regional
campuses.

Nossen, who conducted the
Titusville report, said the study is
still in its “final stages” but added,
“there is enough evidence to
warrant closing the campus.”

The report should be completed
in about a week, according to
associate provost David Powers.
The University Senate last month
set guidelines requiring a compre-
hensive proposal be sent to the
Titusville faculty and adminis-
tration, Chancellor Posvar, as well
as University officials and Senate
committees.

CMU Professor Receives Honorar

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Carnegie-Mellon University Pro-
fessor and 1978 Nobel laureate
winner Herbert A. Simon was
presented‘ with a University of
Pittsburgh honorary doctorate of
letters degree yesterday.

The presentation was made by
Chancellor Posvar at the 1978-79
university honors convocation held
at Carnegie Music Hall, where
Simon, whose outstanding work in

the field of economics won him the,’

Nobel award, was the keynote
speaker.

“As a longtime neighbor of Pitt I
hope I can say a few neighborly
words,” Simon said.

“Pitt and CMU are strong
collaborators. The City of
Pittsburgh is made notable as an
intellectual home and home in
general by the presence of more
than one strong institution of
learning.”

Universities, he continued, are

much the current fee is, one that
has not been increased since its
inception in 1966.

“If SGB can make a convincing
case for Dr. (Conney) Kimbo
(newly appointed vice chancellor
for student affairs), he has the
power to pass his recommendations
to increase or not to increase the
fee to Dr. Posvar,” Bill Markus,
assistantvice chancellor for stu-
dent affairs said. “The entire
matter is ultimately in the hands of

the Board of Trustees who make
the ﬁnal decision.”

Markus said that increasing the
fee had been discussed in the other
years but always deemed un-
necesssary by some level of the
administration.

“We can look at an increase now
but we also have to look at a
student union renovation project
that is down the road and how the
additional fee will affect students
now as well as future recruitment
efforts,” Markus said.

In other business, Tom Kukucka,
former editor-in-chief of The Pitt
News cited what he termed
“loopholes” in the content and
formulation of the Student Publi-
cations and Media Board.

Kukucka claimed that board
by-laws were never officially
approved by the Board of Trustees
at its February meeting.

Kukucka also claimed that the
concept for the board, which was
formed to replace The Pitt News
Board of Directors, was never

made strong by incorporating
research, academic knowledge and
social life.

“The marvel about it is that
these functions (of a university)
coexist most amicably,” Simon
said.

“The notion of a single-purpose
university (is wrong) because it
would destroy the value of a
multi-purpose institution,” he
stated.

Concerning research at uni-
versities Somon said, “(It) is
misunderstood by the public, by
students. Research is sometimes
regarded like drinking or smoking
pot, that it is a indulgence for
people who would be doing
something else. But research lends
itself to the central purpose of
universities, knowledge.

“(We are here today) to
celebrated the university in its
heterogeny, in its confusion and in
is richness,” he said.

Maintenance
Tests For
Asbestos

By JANET MENOSKY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Plant Services and Build-
ing Maintenance Division has
initiated the testing of various
university buildings to determine if
asbestos may have been used in
fire prooﬁng or acoustical treat-
ment of buildings.

Asbestos, a sprayed-on material,
has been proved to cause a rare
form of cancer, mesotheliomia,
after repeated exposure. Particals
may ﬂake from ceilings or travel
through ventilation systems and
may be inhaled.

“We have reviewed the speciﬁ-
cations of all university buildings to
determine areas that may possibly
have asbestos and we are now
testing those areas,” said Van
Conklin, associate director of plant
services. One of the areas which
may possibly contain asbestos is
the Trees Hall Gvmnasium.

Which Way To Peace In The Middle East?

By PATRICIA LANGFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Which Way to Peace in the
Middle East” was the subject of a
debate held yesterday in the Lower
Lounge of the Student Union. The
opposing speakers were Carl
Greshman, founder and chairman
of the Youth Institute for Peace in
the Middle East, and David
Frankel, a member of the Socialist
Workers Party.

Speaking ﬁrst, Greshman offer-
ed a favorable view toward the
recent peace negotiations between
Israel and Egypt.

“Both Egypt and Israel had a
stake in a real, genuine peace
settlement. Egypt, because it
would prefer economical develop-
ment to war, because in past wars
in the Middle East it had born the
brunt of fighting, had suffered the
most casualties and did not want to
suffer them in the future,” he said.
“Also, Egypt did not have an

interest in seeing the Soviet Union
dominate the Middle East, which it
(the Soviet Union) would if the
conflict were not settled.”

He continued, ‘ ‘Israel also had an
interest in peace because it, too,
did not want another war...(lsrael),
too, understood that even a
settlement with Egypt, while it was
not a total ‘settlement in the Middle
East...would be a step towards a
settlement, would be a part of the
peace and would make war very
unlikely in the future.

“Without Egypt, which is the
largest county of the Arab
countries (and) the main force in
past wars with Israel, war would
become very unlikely in the Middle
East. And a compromise was
achieved-—-a genuine comromise
settlement. ’ ’

Greshman pointed out that it was
the aim of the Palestinians and
other groups opposed to the
compromises made in the negotia-
tions between Israel and Egypt to

abolish the state of Israel. How-
ever, these oppositon groups only
showed outwardly for propaganda
purposes a desire to only establish
their own state, he added.

These elements,” he continued,
“and fundamentallly opposed to
the existence of Israel.
consider the very existence of
Israel not a matter of territory but a
matter of aggression. So it is
rather simple to point out why that
is not the direction where peace can
lead to. It is only the direction
where war can result.”

In response to Greshman’s
defense of the recent peace talks,
Frankel said, “Not surprisingly,
Carter is trying to cloak his war
policy in rhetoric about peace.
Carter's diplomacy will not bring
peace and he knows it, which is
why he is preparing for war.

“Washington's real intentions
were spelled out by the editors of
the Wall Street Journal, March 9,
when they said, ‘We want to
ensure the stability of the Middle
East and the security of our
friends. There will be no substitute
for actual U.S. presence in the
area.’ And when the Wall Street
Journal talks about stability and
security, it's talking about protect-

They-

ing imperialist regimes from their
own people.

“That's what the U.S. govern-
ment went to war in Vietnam over
and that's what it is preparing to
go to war in the Middle East over.
The revolution in Iran and fear that
the example of the Iranian people
will be followed elsewhere has
inspired Carter's war preparations
with a new urgency.”

Frankel’s viewpoint was sum-
med up in this statement: “The
conflict is not a religious conﬂict. It

is not due to any desire on the
part of the Palestinians to be new
Hitlers and exterminate the Jewish
people.

“Peace in the Middle East
requires first of all a recognition of‘
this fact, not Carter's phony
autonomy plan. _It requires
acceptance of the right of the
Palestinian people to return to their
homeland and their right for
compensation to the property that
was taken from them.”

Plant Services Tests
Buildings For Asbestos

(Continued from page I)

The testing is being conducted
by Material Consultants and Lab-
oratories Inc., a private organ-
ization not afﬁliated with the
university.

“About six months ago, we
really got involved in reviewing
building specifications and testing
for asbestos,” said Alex Kaminsky,
director of . plant services and
building ‘maintenance. An En-
vironmental Hygenist from United
States Steel visited the university

two weeks ago, offering advice on
testing and handling possible
asbestos hazards. Test results,
determining if asbestos is present,
should be ready in approximately
two to three weeks, according to
Kaminsky.

If asbestos is found, solutions
include complete removal of the
affected ceiling or area, spraying a
special sealing substance over the
asbestos of installing a drop seated
roof.

Nossen said the study examined
ﬁnancial and demographic trends
in addition to the alternatives of
where Titusville students could be
placed in the university system.

Some 400 students and 27 full
and part—time staff members
currently attend Titusville.

Kukucka also charged that the
method of selection of Board
members presented some conflicts
of interest.

“Dean Schulman, who has come
under fire in the past few weeks by
The Pitt News, is a member of our
Board and if he is elected chairman
we would be criticizing him,"
Kukucka said. “The President of
the United States isn’t on the Board
of Directors of The Washington
Post is he?”

“I recall being assured at the
time that exhaustive efforts were
made by Student Affairs to involve

students in this decision by way of
SGB and The Pitt News,” Posvar
said. “It seems as though we’re
dealing with a problem of turnover
within these organizations. But if
anyone here thinks as this as some
kind of move by someone to cover
something up you're dealing with
fantasy."

“I don't think that we are trying
to cook up some fantasy but we
don't like what we see and we
would like and want to see
some changes made,” Kukucka
said.

The Media Board was scheduled
to meet today for the second time

The status of Titusville was also
discussed at last month’s Board of
Trustees meeting. At that time,
Provost Rhoten Smith said it was
the smallest and most costly of the
regional campuses.

Nossen described the study as a
“very, very intensive document,"
explaining certain aspects, such as

restrictions on the future use of the
property, must be examined.

Nossen cited one possible
restriction on requiring the pro-
perty be used for educational
purposes only.

Nossen said the campus’s assets
and liabilities will be studied
closely to determine what Pitt can
do with the property.

meeting be cancelled until Judge
Ruggero Aldisert, chairman of the
board of Trustees’ Student Affairs
Committee can be contacted
concerning the matter. The media
board was scheduled to elect
officers for the coming year at this
meeting.

Posvar said he would not cancel
the meeting but added he would
suggest that the board elect only
temporary officers so that it might
first consider the questions raised
by Kukucka and other members of
The Pitt News.

Fred Fonseca, director of the
Office of Residence Life reported

.on the outcome of the numerical
room selection process used for the
first time this year.

Fonseca termed the new selec-
tion process as being “good news”
for the resident hall students.

At the end of the selection
process Fonseca said there were

approximately 1300 students on a
waiting list to receive housing
space.

Currently there are only 300
students on this list as a result of
students deciding not to live on
campus and students who failed to
turn their housing contracts and
$100 deposits in by the required
deadline.

Of the 2,000 total numbers to be
drawn by the males there were 300
numbers left undrawn.

Of those on the waiting list
Fonseca said the majority were
freshmen and sophomores.

Fonseca cited the housing
situation at Penn State University
where the ﬁrst come, first served
method of room selection (the
method used until this year at Pitt)
was used, causing more than 5,200
students to stand in line for an
excess of 38 hours.

No Price
For Peace
Too High

Peace in the Mideast may cost the United States $5
billion or more in the next five to six years, but no

With the agreement of Prime Minister Menachim
Begin of Israel President Anwar Sadat of Egypt to
peace proposals made by President Jimmy Carter,
officials in Washington indicated it would take at
least that amount to cover the United States’ end of
the bargain in these historic plans.

The bulk of the funds would go to Israel and
would include $3 to $4 billion to help pay for the
removal of airbases and settlements the Israelis have
built in the Sinai Peninsula. With the abandonment
of these bases, the Israelis would also build new for-
tifications and airbases, as well as add new weapons
to their arsenals with the aid of the United States.

Besides these definite commitments, Carter ap-
parently has given assurance to both Begin and Sadat
that his government would give a sympathetic ear to
their requests for military and other aid. Increased
aid to Egypt may also be-needed if Saudi Arabia
refuses to extend further help to the Sadat gover-
nment because of the peace agreements.

Still, peace in the Mideast is worth $5 billion or
even $10 billion. For too long mindless bloodshed
has happened again and again because of the
traditional hatred between the Arabs and Israelis,
and the battle over the historic home of both Jews
and Palestinians. Any moral American must agree
that any costis worth it, if it will end this blood shed
and the suffering it has caused. -

But, it will take more than money to bring final
peace in the Mideast. There remain the legitimate
claims of the Palestinians for autonomous rule of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Also, the problem of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Egypt and other

area will remain an armed camp. The only difference
would be that Israel will not have to worry as much
about its Egyptian border.

Carter has shown he plans to seek answers to these
problems with his promise to include the United
States in any discussions on the Palestinian question.
If he fulfills this promise, it is necessary that Carter
ensure that Jordan and Palestinian representatives
are included in any negotiations. Without these two
groups, any discussion could not be considered
legitimate.

While it seeks a complete solution, the United
States must not allow Israel to shirk from its duty to
reach a solution to the Palestinian problem that is
agreeable to all except the unrealistically hard-line
Palestinians, who "seek the destruction of Israel.
It must be willing to take any step—-even the com-
plete withdrawal of foreign aid to Israel—to win
Israeli cooperation. '

Presumptious Prof Questions Cottam ’s Views on Iran

Of all forms of intellectualized
insult, academic snidery, the art of
avoiding substance by attacking
style. is and perhaps the most
boring. Thus, it is with a touch of
ennui that I respond to a recent
letter by a Professor Rockman that
appeared in your paper. The writer
complained that, in answering
earlier comments by Professor
Cottam concerning the situation in
Iran:

1. I lack the credentials to
assess politics; _

2. My bibliography is sus-
pect, and;

3. Iain presumptuous rather
than patronizing.

The first charge represents a
new way ofthinking, at least new to
American tradition. It would limit
the election rolls to members of the
Political Science Association, chief
amongst them, one Henry Kiss-
inger. His political expertise led

him to conclude that, in Chile,
Allende was a communist and
Pinochet a democrat, and that here
at home the CIA, I'I'I‘ and the
United Fruit Company are patriotic
organizations. I rest my case.

The second charge is untrue. My
letter dealt with the relation
between theocracy, and religious
and ethnic persecution. My biblio-
graphy contains six million names.

The third charge is likewise
untrue. I am both patronizing and
presumptuous. I always have been.

But, let us return to the real
world. one with a rapidly increas-
ing number of “Isla’mic Repub-
lics.” In my previous letter, I made
two statements. The first held
generally that a theocracy does not
and by its very nature, cannot
create democracy. The second
characterized Ayatollah Khomeini
as a religious bigot who demeans
women and calls for acts of violence
against those who deviate from his
moral. social or political precepts.

Recent events clearly support this
charge.

In the past weeks, his followers
have stoned women in the streets
of Teheran, murdered political foes
(however justified) without indict-
ment or trial, killed Marxist
dissidents in the north and Kurdish
patriots in the east.

He has called for a revocation of
the divorce laws now in force which
protect the legal and economic
status of wives and ordered a
return to the law of the Koran
wherein a man (but not a woman)
can go to Reno and back by telling
his mate “I divorce thee” three
times. There is no alimony and he
gets to keep the kids (male, that is).

He and his government have
perpetrated another act which is
particularly saddening and ironcial
to a Jew. Let me explain by
presuming to teach you a bit of
Persian history. In 580 B.C., the
Babylonian tyrant. Nebuchadnez-
zer, conquered Israel. A signiﬁcant

part of the Jewish population was
slaughtered and thesurvivors dis-
persed ,westward to Alexandria,
northward to Spain, Italy and
Europe, and eastward to Babylon
and Persia. In 536 B.C. Cyrus the
Great defeated the Greeks, Baby-
lonians and Assyrians, and created
the Persian Empire.

One of his first acts was to
promulgate an edict, which specifi-
cally recognized the contributions
of the Jewish exiles to the culture
of his country"and the civilized
world in respect to mathematics,
philosophy, medicine and law, to
the moral climate and to the
economy. In the Decree, he
permitted their return to their
homeland, authorized the recon-
struction of the Temple of Solomon
in Jerusalem and established Israel
as an autonomous state within the
Persian Empire.

During the reign of Cyrus the
Great and his son, Persia emerged
as a world power and created
among other things, art forms that
rival those of Egypt, Mexico and
China in brilliance and originality.
During the 25.00 years that
followed, Persia remained a friend
of the Jewish people and a haven
for the survivors of recurrent
slaughters perpetrated by Romans.

crusaders,‘ inqufsitors, Russians
and finally Germans. In turn,
Persia was enriched by an
especially vital and active Jewish
community which made signal
contributions in culture, philoso-
phy, art, music and commerce.

Now, twenty-ﬁve hundred years
later, Cyrus has been replaced by a
new de facto king, the Ayatollah
Khomeini. As did Cyrus, he has
looked upon the Jews, a people
who in the past century have
enriched the world with an
Einstein, Freud, Marx, Heifetz,
Horowitz, Rubenstein, Kafka,
Schoenberg, Mahler, Chagall; a
people slaughtered by Germans
and oppressed elsewhere, who
have once again gathered in their
ancestral homeland and in the face
of unremitting hostility and brutal
terror over the past 70 years
created yet another center of
intellect, culture, art, spirit and a
true democracy. And the edict of
this new king? He gave the Israeli
embassy in Teheran to the Palistine
Liberation Organization. Now real-
ly Professor Cottam. how can you

Regatta Committee
Discusses Celebration

By FORREST BUFFENMYER
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Three Rivers Regatta
Committee met Wednesday aboard
the Gateway Clipper Partyliner to
discuss plans for the second annual
Three Rivers Regatta to be held
Aug. 10 and 11.

After last year’s turnout of
300,000, the group hopes to double
that ﬁgure. The event will be
headquartered around Point State
Park where a large deck barge will
be used as the main stage. The
regatta water activities will focus
on such events as; a decorated
pleasure boat race, houseboat and
speedboat races, a week-long
ﬁshing contest, and a canoe race
which the regatta committee hopes
will match Gov. Richard Thorn-
burgh against the governors of
Ohio and West Virginia.

The main attraction will feature
twelve sternwheelers (riverboats),
all converging on Pittsburgh from
the tri-state area. The riverboats
will race for a set of gold antlers,
the annual Greater Pittsburgh
Steamboat Trophy and a purse of
$75,000.

Honorary Regatta Commodores
include Milton Shapp and Alle-
gheny County Commissioners
Robert Pierce, Tom Foerster and
Jim Flaherty.

The officers of the regatta are
Chairman Eugene Connelly and
Vice Chairmen James J. Kelly and
Ed Beachler.

The major sponsoring groups
‘include the Allegheny County Port
Authority, the Pittsburgh Histor-
ical and Landmark Society and the
Waterways Association of Pitts-
burgh.

Shutdowns Show Hazards

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON-The shutdown
of nuclear plants in four states,
including Pennsylvania, because of
insufficient earthquake protection
has focused attention on the
potential for tremor damage.

While quakes are widely assoc-
iated with California and Alaska,
they have been recorded in every
state.

In fact, the most powerful tremor
ever to hit the United States was
recorded in southeast Missouri in
the early 1800s.

Officials said the plnts are being
shut down because incorrect
calculations led to insufficient
protection against quakes.

Besides the shutdown of Du-
quesne Light Co.’s 850-megawatt
Beaver Valley nuclear generator in
Shippingport, the plants are in
Maine, New York and Virginia.

Here is a brief rundown of the
earthquake history of the Keystone
State.

Since 1800, when two quakes
reported as severe were felt at
Philadelphia, 16 quakes capable of
causing damage have originated in
the state.

IN 1840, severe quakes at
Philadelphia were accompanied by
a swelling of the Delaware River.

A tremor lasting 10 seconds was
reported in 1889 at Harrisburg,
Philadelphia, Reading, York and
other towns.

IN 1934 a shock at Erie caused
buldings to sway, poeple ﬂed
theaters and dishes were thrown
from cupboards. The area west of
Reading experienced some minor
damage from a quake in 1954.

Also in 1954. a localized quake
damaged buildings in Wilkes-
Barre, cracking plaster, heaving
roads and breaking gas and water
mains. A moderate quake alarmed
people in Lehigh Valley in 1961.
but little damage was recorded.

A strong local shock caused
damage at Cornwell in 1964.

‘ The Shadow Box "
A Triumph for Studio

By MARK HOLAN

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Shadow Box

Directed by William Mclaughlin
Studio Theater

People are often accused in
moments of folly that they are
“living their lives like there is no
tomorrow.” Yet all of us live as
though we have an inﬁnite number
of tomorrows to live.

Laboratory Theater and Pittsburgh
Public Theater.

Studio Theatre, however, obtain-
ed permission and has created an
exemplary production.

Director William Mclaughlin has
done a ﬁne job casting the play
composed entirely of Pitt under-
graduate and graduate students.
The entire cast comes off quite
natural in their respective roles.

Especially good are William
Castle as the dying middle-class

“...No matter who you are, no matter what you do, no
matter anything-sooner or later it’s going to happen.

You ’re going to die... ”

“The Shadow Box,” Michael
Cristofer’s 1977 Pulitzer Prize and
Tony Award winning play, is about
people facing the inescapable
reality that they are not immortal.

One of the characters facing
imminent death sums up people’s
attitudes when he says:

“They think it’s a mistake, they
think it’s supposed to last forever.
I’ll never understand that. My
God, it’s the one thing in this world
you can be sure of! No matter who
you are, no matter what you do, no
matter anything-sooner or later-it’s
going to happen. You’re going to
die.”

That’s an obvious, but difﬁcult
realization for people near death to

.make and it’s equally difficult for

those around them to accept.
People have a habit of tightly
clutching onto the sundries of their
lives: words, possessions, friends,
lovers and memories.

All these things, unfortunately,
are very transit.

This is the Pittsburgh debut of
“The Shadow Box” and rights for
the play had been sought by two
larger companies; Pittsburgh

worker Joe, James Edmondson as
the dying writer Brian and Debra
Gordon as his brash ex-wife
Beverly.

Further enhancing the produc-
tion is a beautiful tiered stage
created by Jeffrey Kramer and
effective lighting technique design-
ed by Elizabeth McKenna.

There were, however, a few
acting and technical flaws in
Wednesday night’s opening per-
formance. This is not suprising,
however, considering the amount
of interweaving that goes on
between the play’s three vignettes.

Studio Theatre’s production of
Cristofer’s intense drama is highly
commendable nevertheless. Wed-
nesday night’s audience was
visibly touched by the play-—sever-
al people left weeping.

“The Shadow Box” deals with a
subject most people would rather
not think about, let alone see
vividly portrayed on stage. But for
those not afraid of facing up to it’s
ultimate truths, “The Shadow
Box” is a production well worth
viewing.

James Edmondson and Debra Gordon star in one of three segments in “The
Shadow Box.” The Pulitzer Prize winning play is being performed by Pitt’s

Studio Theatre.

Generation X Connects With New Release

By SAM ROSSI

Pitt News Staffwriter

Valley of the Dolls
Generation X

Chrysalis

Generation X is your basic New

Wave quartet courtesy of the
British pop scene. Naturally, the
foursome specializes in rapid-ﬁre,
intense rock ‘n’ roll. Their new
release, “Valley of the Dolls,” is
their second effort and anyone
familiar with their release will ﬁnd

the same type of sound here.

The group is perhaps best known
for their progressive New Wave
single hit such as “Ready Steady
Go" or the spinoff on the Who’s
“My Generation” titled “Your
Generation."

 

-.\\\-.\ - -

\

Generation X is back ivith another

~.«4ta»»,.....;.m.s»ata:s-3+‘ '»

 

,5 , . V . . , \ ‘

Generation X consists of Billy
Idol singing lead vocals, Tony
James plays bass with Bob
Andrews on lead guitars and Mark
Laff on drums.

“Valley of the Dolls" is
considered by Generation X pro-
ducer Ian Hunter (late of Mott the
Hoople) as part of the groups
“second phase” as a force in the
New Wave scene. The group is
veering away from Top 40 type
sounds and aiming at a somewhat
higher level of New Wave.

The members of Generation X
are self—proclaimed “denizens of
the asphaltjungle.” Through their
rambunctious rock ‘n’ roll they
hope to offer some escape and
solace to other “denizens” forced
to cope daily with contemporary
city life.

Overall, the album is much more
dense than their debut album. The
release is better arranged and
produced and more thought has
gone into the lyrics.

Vintage Lampoon In
‘If We’re Late’

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staffwriter

What do you call fast moving
R-rated entertainment that consists
of 90 minutes worth of skits, songs
slides and zany routines?

The National Lampoon’s “If
We’re Late Start Without Us"
show, of course.

‘‘If We’re Late” is the latest in a
long line of National Lampoon
revues—particularly the infamous
“Lemmings,” which is a parody of
Woodstock——according to Eric
Greenberg, _a writer for the
publication who was in town

‘Wednesday to promote the show.

The show starts off with a rock
concert by the Michael Stanley
Band, then moves into a number of
things ranging from skits featuring
popular Lampoon characters like
New York cab driver Bernie X,
pre-taped projections and musical
numbers.

“The audience doesn’t quite
know which way to look next,”
Greenberg said. ‘.‘It’s in the style
of ‘Animal House.”’

The production stars Rodger
Bumpass, Mark King, Tommy
Koenig, Sarah Durkee and DiDi
Dobbs. It was written by long time

staff editor Sean Kelly with
assistance from several other
Lampoon regulars. ,

Previous Lampoon shows have
given starts to “Saturday Night
Live alumnus Chevy Chase and
current series regulars Gilda
Radner, Bill Murray and John
Belushi. The show has also
absorbed a few’ Lampoon writers
like Michael O’Donoghue and
Anne Beatts.

“It’s a one way relationship,”
Greenberg said of the trade-off
with “Saturday Night Live.”
Lampoon finds new young talent-
writing and performing. We give
them a showcase and then
television picks them up.”

The magazine, which will cele-

brate its ninth anniversary in April,
has a deserved reputation for
ﬂagrant male chauvinism. Accord-
ing to Greenberg, the image pays
off. The initial issue featured a
chaste frony cover—— and bombed.

“We found out that sex on the
covers sells better than political
satire,” Greenberg said.

National Lampoon boasts a 2.5
million readership, 75 percent
male, but last year, the magazine
branched out into ﬁlms with the
release of “Animal House.” A flip
answer to that “American Graffiti”
slogan “Where were you in ‘62?”,
“Animal House starred Belushi
and is the most financially
successful screen comedy of all
time. Greenberg said another
Lampoon film is slated to be ﬁlmed

In the cut “Night of the
Cadillac” the listener finds himself
traveling a treacherous landscape
of a nightmare that seems too real
and tangible.

“The Prime of Kenny Silvers,”
one of the album’s premiere cuts,
is a two-part number depicting
urban life for a growing London
youth.

“Paradise West” is a naturalist-
ic and fatalistic look at life that is
effective in its weary downtrodden
motifs.

Some of the remaining cuts are
more up-tempo and typical rock ‘n’
roll in nature. These cuts are
“Friday's Angels," “Running with

the Boss Sound" and “King
Rocker."
“Valley of the Dolls” will

decided which work to produce.

“It could be ‘Lemmings,”’
Greenberg said, “or it might be

The National Lampoon offices,
which most readers visualize as a
den of chaos. sometimes live up to

that reputation, but Greenberg was
quick to make amends.

“At times, it’s a bit chaotic,” he
said. “But we do put out a national

Most students play by the rules
when placing a long distance
call. They take advantage of bar-
gain rates and make their calls
during the discount periods. If
you're not sure when you can call
at discount rates, check your
phone book.

A few students think it’s OK. to
break the rules by stealing their
telephone calls. They're not beat-
ing the system, they're taking
advantage ot allot us, because it
drives up the cost of providing
telephone service.

Students who break the rules also
run the risk of paying a large tine.
Spending time in jail. And getting
themselves a permanent police
record.

It's just not worth it!

Diver Greenwell Hopes to Fellow in Father's Footsteps

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt diver Pat Greenwell, set to
compete in the upcoming NCAA
Championship, has some interest-
ing career plans.

“I would like to study sports
medicine in Germany,” said
Greenwell, a sophomore physical
education major. “They (the East
Germans) have a program where I
could coach diving and go to school
at the same time.”

Greenwell is familiar with sports
medicine. His father, Robert, is
chairman of American Sports
Medicine for the Amateur Athletic
Union (AAU) and one of the
leading authorities in the ﬁeld.

“I’m pretty much following in
my father’s footsteps,” Greenwell
said. “He’s done a lot of work in
the cardiac rehabilitation area of
sports medicine.

“My father’s been a big factor in
my career, which is good because

you always like to please your
parents.”

Those are Greenwell’s far-range
goals. For now, the sophomore is
aiming to do well in the
championship to be held next
Thursday through Saturday at the
Cleveland State Natatorium.

“I feel pretty confident,” Green-
well said. “I've put in a lot of
background (training) to make it,
although I’m not too sure what to
expect at the nationals.”

“The top contenders will be
there,” added Greenwell, who will
compete in both the one and
three-meter diving. “That in itself
explains everything. It’s going to
be tough.”

Greenwell expects Miami’s di-
vers, led by Olympic champion
Greg Louganis, to win the team
title. Ohio State, which lost to Pitt
last January, is the defending
champion’.

It will be Greenwell’s first NCAA

championship. The sophomore
qualified by finishing second and
third in his events in last
weekend’s pre—qualif1er at Har-
vard.

SWIM NOTES: Pitt’s swimmers
and divers leave Tuesday for the
championship. Besides Greenwell,
diver Scott Winkler and swimmers
Stu Swanson, Mark Schuman,
Mickey Termin, Rick Carter, Mike
Connor and Bob Greenwald will
compete.

  Stetler Places

Stanford Leads AIA W

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Kathy Stetler became only the
second Pitt athlete to gain
All-America status four years in a
row last night at the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wom-
en (AIAW) national swimming
championships. The only other
athlete to gain that honor was Tony
Dorsett.

Stetler finished sixth in the
100-yard butterﬂy with her best
time ever of 256.21. Pitt freshman
Amy Jackson was 16th in that
event. Also achieving All-America
status were Jackson, Suzanne
Pulley and Linda Frankenbach
who, along with Stetler,‘ ﬁnished
eight in the 800-yard freestyle relay
in 7:34.02.

“I’m pleased and excited to be
an All-American for four straight
years,” said Stetler. “But now I
have to prepare for the rest of the
events in which I will be
competing.”

Stetler will be competing in the
200- and 400-yard relays as well as
the 50- and 100-yard freestyle and
the 50-yard butterﬂy. She was
national champion in the 50-yard
butterﬂy last year and is seeded
third this year.

Stanford is leading in the team
scoring race with 178 points.

Arizona State holds second with
165 and Florida is third with. 163.

Rounding out the top ﬁve are Texas
and North Carolina with 128 and
107 points, respectively. Pitt is in
11th place with 38 points.

- placed 42nd overall.

The Stanford women set a new
American record in the 200-yard
medley relay.‘ The team of Linda
Jezek, Noel Moran, Libbie Beaudet
and Kim Peyton took nearly two
seconds off the old record.
ﬁnishing in 1:44.87.

Pitt was 16th in the 200-yard
medley relay. The team of Pulley,
Frankenbach, Sandy Taylor and
Julie Terrell ﬁnished in 1:50.70.

In all, one American record, ﬁve
AIAW records and seven (out of
seven) Trees Hall pool records
were broken last night.

Freshman Joan Pennington of
Texas was the only individual
double winner last night. She was
ﬁrst in the 100-yard butterﬂy
(:54.44) and 200-yard individual
medley (2:00.8l). Both of these
times are new pool and AIAW
records.

Stanford’s Jezek was ﬁrst in the
200-yard backstroke (1:58.83) and
teammate Jo Clark took top honors
in the 500-yard freestyle (4:48.33).

Other national champions
crowned yesterday Allison Grant of
Arizona State in the 50-yard
breaststroke (:29.56) and the
University of Florida’s 800-yard
freestyle relay team, which also
broke the AIAW record, ﬁnishing
in 7:21.00.

In the one-meter diving champ-
ionships, Janet Ely Thorbum of
Southern Methodist set a pool
record, scoring 425.30 points. Pitt
diver Hillary McBride, a freshman,
She missed
making the consolation round by

only four points.

Purdue, Alabama Triumph; Will Clash in NIT Semi-Final

By The Associated Press

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.—-
Junior Joe Barry Carroll scored 30
points last night, leading 15th-
ranked Purdue to a 67-59 victory
over Old Dominion in the National
Invitation Tournament quarter-ﬁn-
als. '

The Boilermakers take a 26-7
mark to New York's Madison
Square Garden, where they will
meet Alabama in one of Monday’s
semiﬁnals. Indiana and Ohio
State, which received third-round
byes, play in the other semiﬁnal.

Carroll had seven of Purdue's
nine consecutive points as the
Boilermakers took the lead for

good. The 7-foot-1 center began
the streak hitting a free throw with
14:08 left in the first half, cutting
the Monarchs’ lead to 13-10.

Keith Edmondson’s 10-footer
with 12:03 left put Purdue ahead to
stay. Then Carroll completed the
surge with a pair of ﬁeld goals,
giving his team an 18-13 edge with
9:53 left before halftime.

Late in the ﬁrst half, Carroll had
ﬁve points as the Boilermakers
outscored Old Dominion 9-2 to
open their biggest lead of the half,
.33-24. They led 33-28 at
intermission.

With 9:22 left in the game, the
Monarchs, who ﬁnished at 23-7,
trailed by only ﬁve points. But
Purdue put together a 10-point
streak, taking a 59-44 advantage
with four and one half minutes left.

Old Dominion lost starting
forward Tony Ellis on fouls during
that streak and their other starting
forward, Tommy Branch, was
ejected for a technical.

Ellis and Bobby Vaughan paced
Old Dominion with 14 points
apiece. .

In other NIT action, Alabama
overcame a 17-point deﬁcit to

outlast Texas A&M 72-68 behind,

Reggie King’s timely buckets and
the clutch play of freshman Eddie
Phillips to move into the semiﬁn-
als.

King "scored 18 points and
Phillips added 17 as Alabama
fought back from an ice-cold first
half in which it went 7:29 without a
point.

The Texas Aggies of the
Southwest Conference scored 19
straight points and rolled to a
23-6 lead before King got Alabama
back in the game with two quick
baskets.

Sophomore forward Ken John-
son scored 20 points for the Tide,

but yielded game-high honors to
Texas A&M’s Rudy Woods, who
had 22 points. Woods was followed
by Vernon Smith and Tyrone
Ladson, who had 10 points each for
the Aggies, who ended the season
with a 24-9 record.

Alabama, now 21-10, built up an

King scored two buckets and
Phillips made a four-point play
when he made ‘a slam dunk and

Two-Piecers
‘Suit’ Ladies
With Record

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

The new two-piece swimming
suits introduced by the Stanford
University team are as outstanding
as the Cardinal women. Stanford's
conspicuously-attired 200-medley
relay of Linda Jezek, Noel Moran,
Libbie Beaudet and Kim Peyton set
an American record of 1:44.87 last
night in AIAW competition.

“We were afraid of diving in at
first, but they don’t fall down,”
said Stanford freestyler Laura
Raymond. “They’re faster and

comfortable. ”

The suit, made by Hind-Wells, is
connected in the back by a
spaghetti-thin strap so as to
conform to international uniform
rules, but there are still doubts
about the suit’s legality.

“We conducted an extensive
search of the rules, paragraph by
paragraph,” said Steve Lee,
national director of sales and
promotion for Hind-Wells. “There
is no rule for costumes.”

“I plan to look at the rulebook
tonight,” said Pitt head coach Dick
Bradshaw, “but I think it’s a one
piece. There hasn't been a
complaint registered. It gives us
all something to think about,
whether to use the suit. It's not
attractive and I think that’s part of
athletics.”

Cardinal coach Jim Gaughan
said the suit gives his team more of
a psychological, ratherthan phys-
ical, advantage.

“You feel like you're going
faster,” agreed Valerie Lee, the
defending national champion in the
1,650-yard freestyle, “because you
have more feeling (against the
skin). They’re more comfortable
but I feel embarrassed.”

Hinds-Wells developed the suit
two years ago with the help of some
Stanford women and gave several
to the team. Stanford kept the suits
a secret for three weeks, until last
night’s finals.

The suit was a mam topic of
conversation at Trees Pool last
night.

“Everyone is interested in the
suit," said Lee. “We’ll be passing
them out to all the teams

tomorrow.”

INDIANAPOLIS——Notre Dame
has the experience and the No. 4
ranking in the nation. But Toledo
coach Bob Nichols believes his
Rockets have a chance for
championship honors in an NCAA
Mideast Regional that also includes
third-ranked Michigan State and
No. 7 Louisiana State.

Nichols is confident about
today's semifinal game with Notre
Dame even though his starting
center is playing with a broken
bone in his left foot.

Michigan State, the Big Ten
co-champion, plays Southeastern
Conference regular-season cham-
pion Louisiana State in the other
semiﬁnal at Market Square Arena.
The winners meet Sunday after-
noon for the right to represent the
region in the NCAA ﬁnals at Salt
Lake City.

“We’ve won our way into the
country’s top 16 teams and we did
it where it counts—on the court,
not by virtue of somebody’s vote on
Monday morning,” said veteran
Toledo Coach Bob Nichols.

Toledo, 22-7, got here with two
consecutive second-half come-
backs. Saturday, the Rockets
edged Big Ten co-champion Iowa
on Stan Joplin’s last-second shot
after trailing the Hawkeyes by 14
points early in the second half.

“I was not surprised at the
victory. . .We did not consider it an
upset,” Nichols said. “We think
we can play with any team in the
country, regardless of where
they’re ranked.” Still, Nichols
, V V . respects the 23-5 Irish, who are
..  V , trying to improve on last year’s
fourth-place finish in the tourn-
ament.

“Notre Dame is a very physical
team. They have a lot of big bodies
and they set good picks and
screens. They’re not only big and
strong, but have a great deal of

Stanford women don the new Hinds-Wells swimsuits that have coaches and
competitors alike debating their legality.

depth. They’ll present a matchup
problem for us, especially at
guard,” he said.

“But our guys are not afraid of
them. We don’t mind playing a
physical game ourselves.”

Dick Miller is the Toledo player
with the bad foot. He broke a bone
on Feb. 14 and didn't practice until
last week. But, the 6,-foot-6 junior
has scored 18 points and pulled
down 14 rebounds in each of his
last two games while mi§sing..only
two minutes of action.

The Irish used a balanced
scoring attack that had fivefplayers
averaging in double ﬁgures at the
end of the regular season.

LSU, 23-5, is still trying to
overcome the shock of Coach Dale
Brown’s suspension of its leading
scorer, sophomore forward De-
Wayne Scales, for reportedly
meeting with a pro basketball
agent during the conference
toumam_<_;nt.

“These guys continually amaze
me,” Brown said after LSU won
despite the absence of Scales.
“I’ve got great faith in all of them.
I’d walk in front of a bullet for any
of them.”

Michigan State, 22-6, is con-
cerned with the physical condition
of sophomore center Jay Vincent.

The Spartans’ No. 3 scorer was
on crutches with a sprained right
ankle after Sunday’_s tournament
victory over Lamar. And he hurt
his big toe in a game the week

‘ ‘The cut for making consolations
was at 32 and while I was ten places
back, I was only four points out,”
said McBride. “That’s how tight
the competition was. I hope to do
better in the three-meter diving
tomorrow.”

Both Stetler and McBride said
that having the nationals at Pitt
was definitely a plus.

“... WE’VE GOTTEN
POSITIVE FEED-
BA CK FROM

OTHER S WIMMERS
THAT IT’S JUST
GREAT.”

I

“I’m really glad it’s here,’ said
Stetler. “Usually, it’s nice to go
away. It’s a psych-up. But, we’ve
gotten so much positive feedback
from the other swimmers that it’s
just great.”

“It’s exciting meeting all of
these other athletes,” McBride
added, “and being in our own pool

is a real advantage. The crowd '

here tonight was great, too.”

Head coach Dick Bradshaw was
pleased with all“ the Pantherette
competitors.

“One of Kathy’,s (Stetler) big
goals in life had to be to make
All-America again,” he said, “and
now she’s done it. With the other
girls making All-America, that’s
the best Pitt has ever done.”

SWIM NOTES: Pitt placed 14th
last year, and Bradshaw said the
Pantherettes’ goal is to place in the
top ten this time....A large, vocal
crowd attended last nights meet,
and a sell-out is expected for
tonight. \

..Events slated for today
and tonight include the 200-yard
freestyle relay, 100-yard breast-
stroke, 200—yard butterﬂy, 50-yard
freestyle and 400-yard medley
relay....Pitt has qualified swim-
mers in seven of those events....
Preliminaries will begin at 11 a.m.,
with ﬁnals starting at 7 p.m....
Three meter diving preliminaries
will begin at 2 p.m.
