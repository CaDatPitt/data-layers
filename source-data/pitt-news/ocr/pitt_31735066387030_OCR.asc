Despite the nature of last night’s
debate between pro-life advocate Phyllis
Schlafly and pro—choice advocate Sarah
Weddington, only a few people were
outside of the William Pitt Union last
night voicing their opinions on abortion.

But sides were definitely drawn inside
the Assembly Room, where the debate,
sponsored by the Pitt Program Council,

was held.
Schlaﬂy, best known as being a force

O behind the defeat of the Equal Rights

Amendment, won the coin toss deciding
who would speak first.

“It seems rather coincidental that we
are here to debate this subject tonight,
the very week that the Pennsylvania
[abortion] law goes into effect. You won-
der what’s wrong with our democratic
process when it takes a law five years to
go into effect,” said Schlatly.

The reason for the delay of this law,
Schlally said, was because of the pro-
choice supporters rallying on the steps
of the Supreme Court, “announcing that
the world was coming to an end  that
this was the end to all abortions. I think
it’s still a question of whether it will stop
any abortions at all.”

Schlafly also spoke of President
Clinton’s campaign pledge to make abor-
tions ‘safe, legal and rare. She said the

abortion is a constitutional right.

“It is not a constitutional right at all, it
is a Supreme Court right, and a Supreme
Court right doesn’t always have to be
there, it can be changed.”

support from university students

‘ By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Support from Pitt students is
needed tor the university’s ath-
letic programs’ success, accord-
ing to Pitt Director of Athletics
Oval jaynes.

Jaynes spoke during yester-
day’s President’s Council meet-
ing about how a proposed $8
or $9 price increase in football
tickets would affect the Pitt
community.

Jaynes said the proposed
increase has been a long time
coming, since Pitt students pay
significantly less for season tick-
ets than students at other uni-
versities.

“We’re proposing and asking
ways in which we can help
finance some things we need,”
Jaynes said.

“Over the course of time, Pitt
has lagged behind in what stu-
dents lat other universities] pay
in ticket fees.”

According to Jaynes, the $20
or $21 students would pay
under the proposed cost hike
would still be much lower than

season ticket prices at other Big
East schools.

“We need the chance to com-
pete with the people we want
to compete with,” Jaynes said.

“Right now we’re far below
those people.”

jaynes said the revenue nec-
essary for expansion and
improvements of athletic facili-
ties would be impossible with-
out a price increase, since rev-
enues from student season tick-
et sales now go toward student
athletic fees.

“The money paid for tickets
stays with the students, and we
don’t get any portion of that
money for athletics,” Jaynes
said.

“Right now we need your
help,” he said. “We hope stu-
dents will understand it.”

Pitt Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs William Harmon
said students should weigh the
increase in season ticket prices
with the $3 per ticket hike in all
other football tickets.

“It’s not a tax across the
board for all students. It's a user
fee,” Harmon said. “Those stu-

dents who want to see a
dynamic football team will [still]
be interested.”

Approximately 6,700 student
season football tickets
were sold last year at $11
each. If this year’s sales re-
main similar, the $9 or
$10 increase in season ticket
costs would result in approxi-
mately $65,000 in additional
revenue for the athletic depart-
ment.

In other President’s Council
business yesterday, Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance co-
President Sacha Layos dis-
cussed the status of Pitt’s action
against its ROTC branch for vio-
lating the university’s anti-dis-
crimination policy.

Layos said ROTC’s “don’t ask,
don’t tell” policy violates Pitt’s
anti—discriminatory policy
because it states that homosex-
ual conduct is grounds for
dismissal from ROTC activities._
Under the policy, the university
cannot discriminate against
employees or students on
the basis of their sexual orienta-

nearing deadlines

By Laura Zotis
For The Pitt News

As the deadline approach-
es, students scramble to get
their financial aidforms sent
in. There are many steps to
the process, but it is not as
hard as it may seem.

The financial aid office
at Bruce Hall has set up
walk-in appointments for
students to help them fill
out their aid forms and
answer any questions that
they may have today and
Thursday.

“As long as you follow the
steps, it’s easy,” said senior
Raymond Rush. —

The forms must be filled
out and all of the signatures
must be in the right
place, and the process can
be completed without a has-
sle.

Chris Zampogna is in his
fourth year at the university
and is a summer employee
in the loan division at the

Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance
Agency. He said if there is a
problem with the loan and it
is not being processed, con-
tact the school, not the loan
center.

“All loan papers have to
be in three months before
the semester starts. If the
school year is about to start
and your loan is not
approved, call the school
and they will approve it for
you,” said Zampogna.

“If the loan center says
that they cannot disburse
the loan, call the school and
find out what the problem
is.”

There are two deadlines
for university-based aid. For
first-year students, the dead-
line was March 1. The
upperclass students must
have their aid forms in by
April 1. _

This aid could get the stu-
dents Perkins loans as well

-Sdrorities, fraternities get moment on stage -at

By Bruce DeBroff
For The Pitt News

Greek Sing brought a cheering
and lively crowd to Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall for one of
the final events of Greek Week
last night.

The contest combines the tal-
ents of singing and dancing of Pitt
fraternity and sorority members
and helps decide who will win
the title for Greek Week.

Performances ranged in variety
from renditions of popular musi-
cals such as Grease and 42nd
S'treet to the traditional titles of
O/elaboma and Oliver.

Several twists were put on a
variety of shows such as “The
Partridge Family” vs “The Brady
Bunch,” and a surprise addition
of rapper Snoop Doggy Dog to
the cast of Mary Poppins.

This year brought the new tra-

dition of combined groups of fra— A

ternities and sororities instead of
each individual one performing
separately.

Chi Omega, Phi Sigma Kappa,

and Sigma Chi’s adapted version
of Oliver won -first place; second
place went to Kappa Delta and Pi
Kappa Phi for their revival of
Grease II, and Annie brought a
third place trophy to the sisters of
Delta Delta Delta and brothers of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Fraternities and sororities
worked long and tiring hours to
pull off a 10-minute song and

dance routine. “We have been
practicing for almost two months
and we‘ve had our share of prob-
lems along the way, but things
have definitely worked out” said
Jennifer Basile of Kappa Kappa
Gamma.

Each year during Greek Week
the fraternities and sororities pick
a charity for which to raise
money. This year the charity of
choice is the Special Olympics.

“This year were sponsoring the
Special Olympics as our charity;
it’s definitely a worthy cause
worth our time,” said Zeta Beta
Tau member Tom Puitell.

There were no holds barred

lambda Phi’s feisty version of the
mambo in a salute to West Side
Story, to the zany offbeat perfor-
mance of the Roc/ey Horror

song “The Time Warp” by Theta

The evening was capped off by
a medley of ‘50s surfing songs by
Delta Phi, Zeta Beta Tau and
Sigma Delta Tau. Unfortunately
the gimmick of throwing beach
balls‘ to the audience backfired
when they were used to assault
the actors.

A formal complaint was
filed against Pitt’s Public
Safety Department yesterday
alleging an officer violated
the first—amendment rights of
a student reporter.

Shawn Maclntyre, editor of
Allegheny View, the student
newspaper of the Community
College of Allegheny County,
said he feels" his first-amend-
ment rights were violated
while he was videotaping a
protest in the Cathedral of

Learning Monday morning.
Maclntyre was covering the
actions of Pitt’s Student
Enviromental Action
Coalition, who were conduct-
ing a protest in Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor’s office.
According to Maclntyre, the

group was approached by‘

two uniformed officers out-
side the cathedral who asked
the protestors to come inside
the cathedral to file a report
of what had occurred in the

‘ chancellor’s office. At that

point another man, who later
identified himself as a plain-

Reporter ﬁles formal complaint A
against Public Safety Department

clothes officer, told Maclntyre
to turn the videotape off.

“He said that he would con-
fiscate my videotape if he
appeared on it, and that if I
used the video, he would
arrest me,” Maclntyre said.
The officer said it was his
right as a citizen not to be
videotaped.

Gary Moses, director of
Public Safety at Pitt, said
Maclntyre should have shown

— his. press credentials and

informed the officers they
were being audiotaped.

Mount Graham activists
sing in chancellor's office

By Robin Senor
Sta ff Writer

Six members of the Mount
Graham Coalition entered Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s office Monday at
about 10 a.rn., sang a rendition
of “If you only had a brain,”
then left the office.

Members of the coalition said
the action was in response to
O’Connor’s request for a 6.8
percent overall increase in
funding from the state last
Wednesday.

Nancy White, secretary to the
chancellor, said the chancellor
was in a meeting at the time
and had not commented on the
action.

“They were very loud and
disruptive,” she said.

The Mount Graham project,
according to the Associated
Press, lost support from
Michigan State University

' Sunday.

According to Josh Knauer,
a member of the Mount Graham
Coalition, the University

of Pittsburgh is the only
institution still interested in
funding the Mount Graham pro-
ject.

“We were wondering how
Chancellor O’Connor could lie
to the state when he says he has
no finances for 1995, but the
Mount Graham telescope pro-
ject is on the budget,” said
Knauer.

“We were also wondering
why O’Connor would want to
spend $15 million out-of—state
when he could be using that
money to improve the overall
general service at Pitt,” he
added.

According to the Student
Environmental Action Coalition,
the observatory originally had
approximately 15 institutions
financially supporting the pro-
ject, but these institutions
dropped out for financial, ethi-
cal and scientific reasons.

SEAC, which has several
members in the Mount Graham
Coalition, is gearing up for a
national day of action on April

pron/toting sensitivity

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance celebrated Sexual
Awareness Week with a series of events that have included a
“Sexual Awareness” information table set up on Monday and

Tuesday in the William Pitt Union.

The booth focused on such issues as combating sexual discrimi-
nation, AIDS issues and the anniversary of the Stonewall
Riot, which is considered the beginning of the gay—rights move-

fIlCﬂ[.

“Sexual Awareness Week is a nationwide week of recognition
where groups make an effort to promote visibility,” BiGALA mem-

ber Megan Hickey said.

In addition to the booth, BiGALA will welcome the Pittsburgh
AIDS Task Force, which will host a “Safer Sex” workshop
Wednesday at 8:30 pm. in the union.

. A University of North Carolina professor of history will speak at
the Graduate School of Public.Health Auditorium at 7:30 pm.

Thursday.

I-Iis speech is entitled “American Gay and Political Movements

Since Stonewall.”

Member Chris Koch described Awareness Week as a “time to be

Visible.”

“I think one of the best ways to do that is to let people know
you’re here and you’re just like everybody else,” Koch said.
BiGALA co-president Sacha Layos said she thought the booth

was successful.

‘‘We’re happy — the boothldrew a lot of people who are taking

information,” Layos said.

Pitt police
By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Student Government Board
public safety chair Pat Catena
announced the addition of bike
patrols to the Pitt campus
police force at Thursday
evenings SGB meeting.

“Hopefully, police on bike
patrols will get to the scene
quicker than they can now,”
Catena said.

“The major problem in
Oakland is traffic, and bike
patrols may be able to get
around that, especially in the
case of catching an assailant in
pursuit.”

According to Catena, the
majority of the plan was set up
by interim Public Safety
Director Walt Watters and
Campus Police Chief Tim
Delaney.

Catena said it will be formally
introduced this Friday at a
security seminar.

add bike patrol to improve campus safety

with universities from through-
out the United States to
develop this plan,” Watters
said.

“We’ve had positive feedback
about its effectiveness in fight-
ing crime and increasing police
visibility."

Catena said the officers have
been specially trained in details
of bike patrol through a pro-
gram sponsored by the
Pittsburgh City Police
Department. The patrol will be
on duty primarily» during day-
light hours.

“There' will be two bike
patrols when the program
begins,” Catena said. “But we
are expecting to have three
within a few weeks.”

Patrols will begin on Sunday,
March 27, according to Watters,
who emphasized the program
is basically experimental this
year.

“It will continue until weath-

At that point we will evaluate‘

Catena also said that for stu-
dents’ safety, the Department

“There has been real prob-
lems with people unaffiliated

"People just get on because

responded to recommendations
of Senate Council’s Ad Hoc
Committee on Non-

promising to monitor ROTC

could be done to ensure
ROTC’s compliance with Pitt’s

anti-discrimination code.

“Our concern is that ROTC is
still present on campus,” Layos
said.

‘‘\We’d like to work on finding
a result to this problem.”

According to _Layos, the
university has not made
much progress since the

recommendations were pre-
sented to O’Connor two years
ago.

“At the time [1992] they were

responsive, but they imple-
mented all the committees pro-
posals that were easy to imple-
ment,” Layos said.

“There hasn’t been much dis-
cussion since that time, and I
think the discussion needs to be
opened back up because no
one is taking action on the
issue,” she said.

deadlines the students, if eli-
gible, can only receive federal

loans.

There are several different
loans that can be acquired
through the government.
They include the PHEAA
loan, the Stafford student
loans and the Parent
Plus loans, which are loans
designed for students who
are still considered depen-
dents.

If all of the loan papers
were not sent to the student’s
home, the student may pick
them up at Bruce Hall.
The supplements and the
tax forms ‘are to be signed,

dated and sent to Bruce
Hall, and the Free Federal
Student Aid forms are to be
mailed in early enough so that
they can get through the sys-
tem, which helps in process-
ing.

“Read directions carefully
and keep copies of every-
thing,” said Cindy Henderson,
senior assistant director of
admissions and financial aid.

The financial aid office sees
students on a walk-in basis
daily, but with this six-
day program that started
last week, Henderson said
she encourages students
to come in and see a coun-
selor from 10 21.111. to 5
p.m. on today and Thurs-
day.

This is the only time that
this service will be available
to the students for the 1994-95
school year.

However, it is not the only ‘
time that students may come
in for assistance.

“Bring all of your papers,

I and the tax returns for 1993

with you to the meeting,” said
Henderson.

“Something else that might
be important to know is that
there is not a separate appli-
cation anymore for a grant.
On the federal aid forms,
answer ‘yes’ to the question
if you want your information
sent anywhere, and the fed-
eral government will send
your forms to PHEAA,” she
added.

Verbanec brought up ESC"s
concern for additional space
usage in Benedum Hall.

Verbanec said many engi-
neering students have been
looking for more study space
and would benefit from the
expansion of Benedum’s facili-
ties.

“were feeling very cramped
in Benedum, and we really
have no space to study,”
Verbanec said.

Abortion

Court who might try and over-
turn Roe vs. Wade. “Bush was
defeated and Roe vs. Wade will
never be overturned.”

“The reason so many doctors
and nurses help women today
is because they were in this pro-
fession before Roe vs. Wade,
and they saw the tragedies
played out in the lives of
women,” Weddington said.

“We sometimes think of peo-
ple representing themselves that
if you’re Christian you have to
be opposed to abortion,”
Weddington said, “but that isn’t
at all true  there are Christian
groups that are opposed to
abortion, but there are many
other Christian groups who
believe that it is an individual’s
decision and it has nothing to
do with the Christian faith.”

Speaking on the Pennsylvania
law that would mandate a 24-
hour waiting period before an
abortion is performed,
Weddington said there is no
medical procedure that a man

could have that requires a wait-

ing period.
“I guess they were trying
to say that [women] just

don’t think about these things
and we’ve got to make them
think.”

Weddington said the money it
would cost for an abortion is
four times less than the cost of
the first two years of welfare
benefits to children born. “What
I’m hearing is people saying
‘Lets cut welfare dependency’ 
at the same time they want to
cut funds that would allow
women to make their own
choices.” .

Schlafly’s response was, “Yes,
it’s cheaper to kill people than
to keep them alive  nonciti-
zens should have rights, they
should not be killed.”

Schlafly concluded her posi-
tion by saying, “Abortion is the
great social, political and
immoral equivalency of slav-
cry.”

Responding, Weddington

UNIVERSITY OF PIITSBURGH

.  g ‘WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23, .1994 I

Women deserve to ma/ee the choice

Once again the abortion debate has hit Pitt’s campus,
drawing both pro-choice and pro—life believers into a
heated debate. Attorney SarahWeddington, who suc-
cessfully argued Roe vs. Wade in the 1975 landmark
case granting women the right to have abortions, and
Phyllis Schlaﬂy, who is best known as a major contrib-
utor to the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment,
debated the issue last night in the union. '

The debate was made more "relevant and timely in
that Pennsylvania’s new abortion law goes into effect
this week, requiring a 24-hour waiting period before
an abortion is performed in the state.

Both women sited human rights as their main selling
point in their arguments.

“It’s cheaper to kill people than to keep them alive 
noncitizens should have rights, they should not be
killed,” Schlafly stated.

“I will never forget a black woman who once said to
me, ‘Ifthe government said that I had to have a child, I
would once again be a slave,’” Weddington responded.

The difference in their argument is that one is pro-
moting the protection of unborn, not-yet-fully devel-
oped fetuses, and the other is promoting the protection
of over half of the United States’ population. A woman
should have control over her own body. It’s that sim-
ple.

We are not advocating that abortion be used.as birth
control, but rather that the choice should be available.

Weddington raised the point that no medical proce-
dure a man could have requires a waiting period.
Pennsylvania’s new law is telling women they aren’t
capable of making a rational decision themselves the
first time they visit a doctor, that they need an addition-
al 24 hours to think. This is treating women as second-
class individuals. If a women is mature enough to
become pregnant, she is mature enough to weigh her
options and make a decision. Whether she chooses to
make that decision in one hour or in 48 hours should
be her choice and her choice only.

Although pro—life advocates are pressuring for restric-
tive laws prohibiting abortions, if such legislation pass-
es it will not stop women from seeking abortions.
Abortions were not permitted in the early 1970s, yet
women still had them.

Prohibition of abortion will make what is now a safe,
medically-regulated procedure a danger.ous, unmoni-
tored process that will result in tragedy for thousands
of women who .have no other option than to seek an
abortion from someone who may or may not be med-
ically qualified to perform the procedure.

Everyone in this country should have the right to
decide what happens to their bodies. This right should

include women and their choice to be or not to be"

pregnant.

The Clinton administration
not only thinks its cabinet
should “look like America,” but
it also feels that way about col-
lege campuses. They believe,
and rightly so, that the student
bodies of major colleges and
universities should be represen-
tative of the people of the
United States. The more people
that this country educates, the
better it is for all people. Steps
should -be taken to see that
anyone who wants to go to col-
lege can afford to do so.

In order to achieve diversity
the , adminis_tration has
approved the controversial
practice of awarding scholar-
ships solely on the basis of
race. The policy, as reported by
The New Yorle Times, will let
race-based scholarships contin-
ue at schools that receive feder-
al financial aid, but the same
schools must comply with anti-
discrimination laws.

According to Dr. Betsy
Porter, the Pitt Director of
Admissions and Financial Aid,
no money will be taken from
any of Pitt"s need- or merit-
based scholarships.

Diversity should not be used
as an excuse to create exclusive
scholarships. Separatism and
attempts to advance specific
groups by exclusionary means
are unconscionable. True diver-
sity will not be promoted by
these methods. Instead they
will lead to legal battles and
cries of “raci-sm” all around. It
must also be remembered that
true diversity is not a black-
and-white issue, nor can it be

quantified. Diversity is foundin

the mindset of the students. If
they want nothing to do with
members of other ethnic
groups and races, then no quo-
tas will promote diversity.

At the 25th annual sympo-
sium of the Center for the
Study of the Presidency, White
House Director of
Communications David Gergen
suggested that education would
help to solve a large number of
the problems that face this

2‘ W;

Excellence more important than diversity

country. One of my fellow con-
ference members, Howard
Murphy, suggested that educa-
tion be completely free for
those who want to take advan-
tage of it. Everyone from Ice-T
to David Gergen has intimated
that education is the panacea
for America’s conundrums.
Free, unlimited education
would eliminate questions of
minority retention and repre-
sentation and would be a good

measure of educational quality.*5

However, this egalitarian pipe

Benjamin
Jackson

dream would probably be
bashed by conservatives for
being government interference
and by liberals for being cultur-
ally—biased.

If there is publicly-funded
money involved in scholarship
money, there must be a blind
standard of fairness. Instead of
trying to match percentages of
population, basing scholarships
strictly on merit or strictly on
financial need would be much
more productive. There are no
guarantees that these scholar-
ships will go to those who truly
need them. It would be a
shame to have a scholarship
which, being designed to help
out a truly disadvantaged indi-
vidual, instead pays for some-
one’s education who has had
all the advantages that a stu-
dent could ask for.

In 1991, according to The
New Yorle Times, the Bush
administration tried to abolish
scholarships awarded solely on
the basis of race. Their argu-
ment was that scholarships
should be given out on the
basis of merit. This argument
stems from the idea that those
who do well should be recog-
nized. It is odd that in the
realm of athletic scholarships,
very little discussion is given to
the ethnic background of the
players. In addition, as NCAA

t. i.:.>\s,.>  s, “§“c‘;‘

investigations have-shown, little
discussion is given to the ‘play-
er’s academic ability. They are
recognized entirely for their
athletic prowess.

I don’t‘ mean to imply that
athletic scholarships should be
banned or that athletes are
unworthy. Quite the contrary, I
believe that because these
scholarships recognize those
who can do things well and
promote human attainment that
they should be encouraged. I
would like to seemore sports
become high-profile sports so
that a more diverse range of
talent could be recognized as
opposed to the standard foot-
ball and basketball recognition
that takes place.

It is a sign of decadence that
this country does not hold aca-
demic prowess in the same
regard. I asked Dr. Wesley
Posvar, who created the
Chancellor’s Undergraduate
Merit Scholarship when he was
the chancellor of Pitt, about
why he created them. He said,
“I thought if we could give
them for athletics, we could
give them for academics.”
There is an anti-intellectual
strain of thought in this coun-
try. It seems as though intellec-
tuals are lauded when they
build a better bomb, but ask a
guy with an engineering schol-
arship if he can pursue his true
intellectual goals, and you will
find that this is not always
encouraged or possible, at least
according to one such recipient

—whom I know. Scholarships,

especially those which claim to
promote expungation of igno-
rance must allow students to
roam the halls of knowledge
with impunity.

If there is no better way to
address the problem of racial
disparity at colleges and univer-
sities, then this way must be
carefully guarded to ensure that
the truly needy get the scholar-
ships.

Football take '

By Jason Brame
Sports Editor

In the midst of weekend

NCAA basketball upsets and 

daily spring training news,
another sport has moved into
the local limelight and promises
to grip the hearts and minds of
Pitt sports faithful for the next
couple of weeks.

No, it’s not the vastly growing
women’s rugby competition
that is sweeping across a
Cathedral lawn near you. It’s the
annual green-grass football sea-
son up at Pitt Stadium — col-
lege football spring practice to
you and me.

Enthusiastically back for his
second year at the helm of the
Pitt Panthers is the always-
beaming Johnny Majors, who
led a very untalented Pitt squad
last year to as close to a magical
3-8 season as is possible.
Stressing an improved attitude
amongst his team and a pair of
All-American candidates, Majors
is excited about a spring prac-
tice that includes two new
junior college players and a pair
of transfer.

“I have seen a tremendous
attitude change,” Majors said.
“To see how far we’ve come
from last year with this group
was amazing. I have no idea
what the win-loss record will
be, but we will have to meet the
challenge to the best of our abil-
ities.”

Majors will rely heavily on
three stand—outs from last year’s

team: All-American candidates‘

Huemrich wraps up bluacollozr career

By Ryan Buneher
Asst. Sports Editor

Through all of the changes in
Pittsburgh over the years, the
blue—collar image remains. The
people here also love sports
and have a special soft spot for
blue—collar athletes, that player
who you can count on every
game, that athlete who would
rather play ball than talk trash.

Jonna Huemrich, who will
finish her career at this week-
end’s NWIT, has been that kind
of player over the past four sea-
sons for the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team.

“You don't want a player that
is always in your face telling
you how good she is,” Lady
Panther head coach Kirk Bruce
said. “Jonna’s about the busi-
ness of playing the game.
People tend to gravitate more
towards someone like that than
somebody you have to put mus-
tard on. She is definitely not a
hot dog."

Huemrich has gone about the
business of being a rock—solid
consistent scorer for Pitt the last
four years, averaging 15.5
points per game over her
career.

She raised that mark to 18 per

and scratch-and-claw defensive
tackle Tom Barndt.

“I’ll be going out. there and
practicing technique, as far as
running-wise and lowering my
shoulder and testing its
strength,” said Martin, who
missed some time near the tail
end of the season with a shoul-
der injury. “I’ve gotten a lot
stronger over winter condition-
ing and a lot quicker, I feel.”

Martin’s All-American candi-
dacy seems to impress everyone
but himself, as he is content to
just “do the job that I know I

game each of the last two years,
while racking up double digits
in points in the last 55 games.

“The pressure is even more
on her, because they try to stop
her,” Bruce said. “With each
one, it becomes increasingly
more visible that she is doing
the job because the other team
is dying to stop her.”

She does it with solid games
every time out. Huemrich has
only scored over 30 points in a
game once in her career, a 56-
point effort against Providence
her sophomore year.

“I don’t want to score 30
points a game,” Huemrich said.
“Basketball is a team game.”

Still, there are those pretty
plays that get your attention.

“All year long, Jonna will
make a shot and [assistant
coach] Larry [Anderson] and I
will turn to each other and say,
‘Do you believe that?’ \X/e’ve
seen a lot of players come and
go, and it takes a lot to make us
say ‘wow.’ \X/'e’ve done that a lot
with her.”

They have also seen her work

‘to improve the rest of her game.

“She is willing to look at her
shortcomings and work on
them,” Bruce said. She’s never
satisfied with her performance.”

can do, and all that stuff will
take care of itself.”

Martin, Brown and Barndt
headline a squad that, along
with the return of Dietrich Jells
from a season-ending injury and
probable redshirt junior season,
will receive the help of strong
safety Ricky Rowe and defen-
sive tackle Tyler Young -
transfers from Penn State and
Notre Dame, respectively.

“I blocked against [Youngl
last year [on the scout team] and
I like the way he plays,” Brown
said. “He takes no mess from

“My main job is scorer, along
with other things that Coach
Bruce yells at me all the time
about doing,” Huemrich said.

The self—depreciation creeps
back in. Huemrich will show
you how good she is, but she
won’t tell you about it, and,
despite her competitive nature,
she is not a trash-talker.

“I don’t want to sound arro-
gant, because I can’t stand peo-
ple who are that way. When I
make a shot, I don’t say any-
thing,” Huemrich said. “I feel
like it is a jinx, and my next shot
will be a brick. I’m supersti-
nous”

Huemrich has her rituals,
such as her pregame musical
choices and private time before
home games, but her supersti-
tions failed her at the Big East
Tournament.

Huemrich dominated a game
against Miami in the first round,
scoring 28 points on 12-of-16
shooting from the field and
grabbing 17 rebounds.
Huemrich said it was probably
her best game at Pitt, so she
tried to repeat the same prepa-
rations for the next day’s game
against then 14th-ranked Seton
Hall.

anybody. I think he’s going to
move into a good position —— I
don’t think he’ll start but he’ll
get some good playing time.

“A lot of the receivers tell me
that [Rowe] is tough and aggres-
sive, and we obviously need a
lot of help back there.”

Aside from scouting new tal-
ent, Brown is being counted on
to be the mainstay of the
Panther offensive line. His work
ethic, once highly questionable
under former head coach Paul
Hackett, has become exemplary

ties that could be expected
during their Pitt career.

It now appears that the
speculation over facility
improvements is turning into a
tangible, eight-phase plan that
could be announced within a
week. The plan is too late for
Pitt’s recruiting season this
year, but it could be paying
dividends by the time Majors:
hits the recruiting trail again.

“This is a start,” Majors said.
“We need to start with the

that makes it the best for the

“It’s important for us. We
needed them.”

There isno definitive cost
yet for the initial phases of
improvements, but some pro-
jections have it at over $5 mil-

The facility improvements,

said, “the highest level of

“Today, with the way

to the point where you can’t

Jaynes said. “You have to sell
what is on your campus.”

Majors was obviously
pleased with having a plan
about to go into effect as he
spoke at Pitt’s spring football
press luncheon, marking the
first day of spring drills, yester-
day. .

“There has been a renais-

Lacrosse
dominates
late, blows
out CMU

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer '

The Pitt Men’s Lacrosse team

made the long journey down
Forbes Avenue last night in
order to play against their
rivals at Carnegie Mellon
University.

. The final score was no sur-
prise as Pitt went on to win by a
final of 12-4. The game started
out shakey for the Panthers
as CMU came out firing and
took a 3-0 lead to start the
game.

However, Pitt got its act
together and went on a 5-0 run
to come back and take the lead
at halftime.

The third quarter was also
competitive, as CMU remained
in striking distance.

Thefourth quarter was a dif-
ferent story as the Panthers
started to open things up.

With the score already 8-3, Ed
Croot scored the ninth goal for
Pitt with his third of the game at
the 11:10 mark.

Jeff Shaner answered next for
Pitt at the 9:47 mark.

From that point on the game
was played in running time, and
Pitt added two more goals and
CMU added one late to close
the scoring out.

“\Y/hen we started off we were
down three and we were able
to rally and come back and
played a good solid second
quarter and then was able to
continue it into the second half.
The team played well together
and we never quit and we came
up with the ‘\X/",” Pitt’s Eric
Seamen said.

“Once everybody gets their
heads into the game, you just
can’t stop us,” defenseman Tim
Kenkel said.

“We can come back from
deficits and win. We should
have. come back on Saturday la
loss to Frostburg State], but we
just took too long to start play-
ing our game.”

Speaking of Pitt’s loss on

A Saturday, which was their first

of the year, they were able to
get back on track on Sunday
afternoon at Pitt Stadiumagainst
juniata and won by a blowout
score of 25-2.’

Last night’s win, along with
the one against juniata, raises
the team’s record to 6-1 overall.
Pitt’s next game is at Pitt

One game. One single, soli-
tary game.

No matter how you size it up,
no matter how many impressive
wins a team may have under its
belt, no matter how much one
squad deserves to be in the
playoffs, so often a long, ardu-
ous baseball season can come
down to one game.

One seemingly insignificant
game can often send a good
team packing, agonizing over
every single squandered oppor-
tunity during the year. Just ask
the San Francisco Giants.

Or, for that matter, just ask
the Pitt Panthers.

Last year, the Panthers were
the Big East’s Cinderella kids,
climbing out of theconference
dungeon to become a serious
championship contender’. But,
losses in six of their last eight
games sent the Panthers on a
steady downward spiral, deny-
ing them their first-ever Big East
Playoff berth.

They finished the Conference
season with a stinging 5-3 loss
to UConn, giving them a 10-11
record. That left them one game
behind St. John’s, giving the
Redmen the fourth and final
playoff spot over the Panthers.

One lousy, miserable, revolt-
ingly rotten game.

Fast—forward to 1994. This
year’s Panthers show only a
slight resemblance to last year’s
squad, with several key players
gone and just as many new

“Last year, we hada lot of

our guys began to cool off,
other teams started to heat up.

“We have several guys back
who made key contributions
last year  [and] we have a lot
of good recruits. I think we are
right in [the playoff huntl.”

All told, the Panthers lost 13
players from last year’s team
that posted school records in
wins (30), runs scored (385),
hits (443), doubles (84) and
stolen bases (164). Those 13
players include five who, com-
bined, figured in, on over three-
fourths of the Panthers’ run pro-
duction last season. They also
lost their two top pitchers
(Jason Rakers and Bill Junker)
and both of their starting catch-
ers.

The graduation of Brad Reese,
Jason Roth, Al Lardo and Pat
Walsh ended one of the most
productive eras in Pitt baseball
history. Along with Jerry
Berteotti, whose eligibility ran

‘out after last season, Pitt’s Fab

Panther lineup in 1993.

Second baseman Reese, a fix-
ture in the Panther lineup since
his rookie year in 1990, finished
among the Big East leaders last
season with a .350 batting aver-
age, including a .397 mark in
conference games. His 13 dou-
bles tied Pitt’s single—season
record, and he finished his illus-
trious career as Pitt’s all-time
leader in games played (144),
and remains among the school’s
leaders in hits (136) and stolen
bases (45). He has remained
with the team this year as an
assistant coach.

First baseman Roth and center
fielder Lardo added a ferocious
power element to a squad that
was second in the Big East with
43 home runs in 43 games, and
sixth in the nation in team bat-
ting average (.333).

Lardo headed up the Panther
longball department with eight
round—trippers, including six in

kept him among the conference
leaders in that category.

most consistent players in ‘93,
ﬁnishing with a .362 average, 32
RBI, 12 doubles and five home
runs.

The’ one-two punch of Walsh
and Berteotti made up the Big
East’s most potent catching tan-
dem in "95. They led the Big
East by gunning down 58 per-
cent of all runners attempting to
steal. S

Walsh was a powerhouse,
batting .550 and driving in 55
runs in just 103 at-bats.
Berteotti, one of Pitt’s most pro-
lific clutch-hitters since his
rookie season in 1991, finished
the ‘95 campaign with.26 RBI
and five home runs in 98 at-
bats. He is third on Pitt's all time
list with 88 career RBI.

Such a mass exodus of
proven talent would normally
drive most programs into
obscurity and perhaps an early
burial, but don’t break out the
shovels just yet.

As per usual, Jackson has
dipped into the junior-college
talent pool for experienced and
capable players to fill in the

huge voids in the lineup.

One of the most notable juco
transfers is Ontario native Tyler
Shantz, who was a member of
the Canadian National team.
Shantz, a third baseman, was
expected to add good offensive
numbers in the middle of the
Panther lineup this year, and he
has not disappointed so far.
Playing much of Pitt’s first 11
games in the cleanup spot,
Shantz is currently batting .555
and leading with 15 RBI.

Junior Scott Etsell, another
juco prospect, will have some
big shoes to fill, as he becomes
the man to replace Reese at sec-
ond base. He has already
shown his ability to make things
happen in a game when against

Kent, when his three—run homer

in the top of the sixth brought
the Panthers back from a four-
run deficit to trail by just one. In
that game, Etsell also scored
three runs while going two-for-
two at the plate.

Junior Jon DeBernardis, a
juco transfer out of Lindenhurst,
Ill., will try to replace the
Walsh—Berteotti platoon to

the team in batting average

percent of all would-be thieves.

One true first-year player
making a significant contribu-
tion is center fielder Jason Conti
out of Seneca Valley I-l.S. Conti,
who has batted in several differ-
ent spots in the Panther lineup,
is currently hitting .514 with five
RBI and 10 runs scored.

With so many new faces on
the Pitt team, Jackson will be
looking more than ever to his
few returning lettermen to lend
a little leadership to a group in
need of some chemistry.

Senior shortstop Danny
Gonzalez leads the group of
retuming players as a fine con-
tact hitter and defensive short-
stop. Gonzo batted .415 against
all opponents and .446 against
Big East competition as a rookie
last year. ' ’

He and Reese formed a near-
ﬂawless middle infield, as the
Panther double-play combo tal-
lied just 19 errors in 550
chances between them.

First baseman Josh Tyler, a
former Big East player-of—the—
week, brings his .562 average
and 52 RBI of a year ago back
for another season. Roth, along
with designated hitter Ken Strish
and outfielders Kurt
Womelsdorf and Kurt Allen, will
provide experience and leader-
ship to the Panther squad.

On the mound, the exit of
Junker and Rakers coupled with
the loss of LHP Mickey Vincent,
RHP David Kelley and LHP Rob
Hanawalt gives coach Jackson a
cavernous hole to fill. One the
size of 19 wins and 179 strike-
outsj

One workhorse that Coach
Jackson will be leaning on to
make up for the lost talent will
be junior RHP Jamie Goettler.
Goettler redshirted last season
after appearing in just ‘two
games, compiling a 1-0 record
in just eight innings "of work.
Goettler has already nearly
tripled that amount of work so

far in 1994, while posting a 1-1 _

record with a 2.53 ERA.

Shaffer will likely make up the
remainder of Pitt’s starting rota-
tion, while Ed Curtis, Chris
Bean, Trevor George and Bob
Richardson look to be the
important set-up men.
Sophomore RHP Matt
Skokowski is back for another
season as Pitt’s primary closer.
Skokowski finished a successful
rookie campaign in ‘95 with
four saves and a 2-1 record, as

well as 15 strikeouts in 14 relief -

appearances.
“We’ve had some very good
performances [from our pitch-
ersl,” Jackson said. »“We’ve been
focusing on challenging hitters

‘with whatever the pitchers

throw well. It’s been working
well so far.”

This latest group of Pitt
hurlers look to finally bring an
end to the erratic pitching that
has plagued the team in years
past. Though finishing with 50
wins, last season’s Panther
pitching staff finished a distant
fifth in the Big East with a 5.94
team ERA and gave up 24 ‘home
runs — more than any other staff
in the conference.

in his senior year — a senior
year that many thought he
would forego to enter the NFL
draft. '

“I’m willing to take a lot more
responsibility,” the newly-
Afroed Brown said. “I had a lot
of people approaching me after
last season telling me I had the
opportunity to leave [for the
NFL], but I still got some things
around here that I need to do
and I don’t think I’m ready for it
yet.

“lHackett’s tenure] was a dif-
ferent time for me, when I blew
a lot of things off and didn’t
take responsibility for a lot of
things. If they punished me by
waking me up at six in the
morning, then it wasn’t a big
deal. But I went through a lot of
things, and I’m willing to take a
lot more of responsibility now.

“I’ve seen myself do things
that I didn’t think I could. I hate

, to lift, but I got into it. And after

it was all over, I felt really good

-about it,” Brown said. “That’s

why I came back — because
I’ve seen the things I can do.”

Majors has had the Panthers
in the weight room four times a
week since the end of the sea-
son, and has watched bench-
presses and vertical jumps
increase exponentially since the
mandatory work became more
strictly followed.

“There has been a big attitude
adjustment,” Martin said. “This
year, everyone is looking for-
ward to spring practice as
opposed to last year when they
were like, ‘Oh, it’s time for
spring practice again.’ This year
a lot of people are hungry to
make their spot on the team.”

“We had a struggle many
times last year,” Majors said,
“But we’ve had a decided
improvement in our off-season
work. It has been a very rare
circumstance when I had to
push a guy into the weight
room [this off-seasonl.”

And while Majors has players
more physically prepared, he
also has, well, more players. At
times dressing only 70 or 75, the
roster is up to around 105,
thanks in large part to a success-
ful walk—on program and a bet-
ter recruiting season in which
Majors landed vaunted junior
college quarterback Sean
Fitzgerald and Canadian defen-
sive back E.C. Varoutsos from
Montreal.

“I really don’t know what to
expect from Sean Fitzgerald —
that’s what practice is about,”
Majors said. “lQua1terbackl John
[Ryan] is still our No. 1 because
he got a lot of the time last year,
but I don’t know who will be
one, two or three going in.

“I like to exit spring practice
with a No. 1 quarterback, but
there have been many, many
times when we have not,”

With hopes of exiting’ the
April 16 Blue—Gold game with a
clearer understanding of
strengths and weaknesses of his
team, Majors said that they want
to try to scale down offensively
and make the plays that his
offense missed last season.

"We plan to cut back offen-
sively, to execute a little better

Dietrich Jells returns from injury this season.

and to line up and come off the
ball better,” he said. “We know
more about the players and
their capabilities.” '
David Sumner, who left the
team late in the year last season,

 

is back with Pitt workingto get
his job back in th.e defensive
backfield. Sumner walked off
the practice field last year,
thereby resigning his on-again-
off-again starting position.

“David Sumner wanted to
come back and I’m giving him
the opportunity,” Majors said.
“He’s been moved down and
will have to work his way back
up. He felt like he made a mis-
take, and he probably did.”

Those not competing in drills
are few but noteworthy. Tight
end Chad Skrocki will be out
because of an off—season shoul-
der problem. Redshirt freshman
running back Dion Alexander,
who had surgery on his back
during the off—season, will not
compete. Senior defensive back
Maurice Williams will be limited
due to continuing knee prob-
lems. _

There are also several players
who will be getting looks at dif-
ferent positions. Linebacker
Tony Reardon will get some
time at tight end, and 190-lbs.
Anthony Dorsett will play some

at outside linebacker instead of
defensive back or wide receiver
— positions where he received
time last season.

There have also been a few
coaching changes since last sea-
son. Former running backs
coach Charlie Coe has been
promoted to assistant head
coach, and Ken Karcher has
been upgraded from pass coor-
dinator to offensive coordinator.
He will continue to work with
the quarterbacks.

The vacancy at linebackers
coach left by Rusty Russel has
been filled by Aliquippa native
Bob Babich, who coached the
linebackers at East Carolina the
previous two years.

end coach, resigned his position

"Everything had to be exactly
the same. I was trying to do
everything the same." Huemrich
said, “But we lost anyway."

That loss left the 19-9 Lady
Panthers on the edge of an invi-
tation to the NCAA Tournament.
The invite never came.

"I'm happy with what I did
here personally. but as far as the
team went, we never won any-
thing big. I’m disappointed that
we never made the NCAA tour-
nament lin my careerl,"
Huemrich said. “That leaves a
bad taste in my mouth. I wanted
to do something more.”

What I-Iuemrich did was step
right in as a starter coming out
of Bethel Park High School as a
big time recruit. The Street

able mention All-American
turned down such high profile
programs as Penn State and the
University of Virginia to stay in
the Pittsburgh area.

“What first attracted me to Pitt
still does — Coach Bruce and
the team,” Huemrich said.

Huemrich said she has ques-
tioned the decision at times,
wanting the success of the top-
level programs.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, March 23, 1994

“It’s everybody’s dream to be
in the tournament, the Final
Four and have a great follow-
ing," Huemrich said. “Those are
things I wish could have hap-
pened here. I don't regret my
decision coming here.”

One of the reasons for that is
the relationship Huemrich has
had with her teammates.

“My teammates are great."
I~Iuemriclr said. "I want to take
them all [to the top level of
competition] with me."

The other positive aspect of
Pittsburgh was being close to
home.

“It‘s been great to have my
family come to all of my home
games," Huemrich said.

One thing that frustrated
Huemrich over the last four
years was the lack of company
her family and friends had in
the stands. Pitt continues to
struggle to draw fans, averaging
just 385 fans per game at home
this season.

“I thought when I first got
here that everything was going
to change,” Huemrichsaid.
“People would com-e to see
games. We were going to be
great. I think I was naive.”

JOSTENS

1'ooAY, 1 OAM-4PM
‘ma BOOK CENTER

Meet with your Jostens representative for full details.

Bruce and her teammates, but is
eager to escape what she con-
siders a place as second-class
citizens to the men‘s team.

"I won’t miss feeling second-
rate,” Huemrich said. “How we
are treated is so different from
how the men’s team is treated.

“I know it’s come a long way.
I remember my freshman year
when the band. and the cheer-
leaders didn’t come to games
and we had maybe three people
in the stands."

Exaggerations of lack of peo-
ple aside, not many fans have
seen Huemrich’s contributions.

She stepped in as a rookie in
the ‘90-‘91 season at small for-
ward, a natural position for a
six-foot player with good quick-
ness and a sweet jumper, oppo-
site Pitt’s all—time leading scorer,
Lorri Johnson. Huemrich has
moved to the ‘post relatively
early and has stayed there as
she has started all 115 games
the Lady Panthers have played
the last four years.

“She’s played hurt," Bruce
said, “We haven’t babied her in
practice. She is time-tested."

When Jolmson and center
Connie Hurt left, the low post
and a good bit of pressure fell
on Huemrich.

“[Her sophomore and junior]
years were really tough because
those complementary players
weren’t kicking it in like they
are now,” Bruce said.

“My sophomore year and all

of last year, I didn’t sleep during ,

basketball season, especially on
the road,” Huemrich said. “I
could never sleep on the road. I
do this to myself. I put a lot of
pressure on myself."

The team struggled to an 11-
18 mark in the ‘91—’92 season,
improving to 13-12 last year, but
still lacking offensive balance.
Huemrich led the team in scor-
ing and rebounding each year,
 she did this season.

Huemrich has led the way
again in the 93994 season, but
things have been different. Jill
Colabrese and Jenine Joyce
stepped up offensively. The
team was able to run and
improve its long—range shoot-
ing. The club got its first post-
season invitation since the ‘80-
’81 season.

“This year, I slept well all the
time. If I had a bad game, we
could still win,” Huemrich said.

The reality of that basketball
career coming to an end is
beginning to set in. Huemrich
said that she is considering
going overseas to try pro bas-
ketball. She said that she even-

" tually wants to get into coach-

ing. most likely at the high
school level.

“I'll miss being a part of the
team -— the relationships with
my teammates on the court and
off," Huemrich said. “I’ll miss
Coach Bruce and the relation-
ship we have.”

Bruce is faced with replacing
not only Huemrich, but also
seniors Colabrese, Erin Maloy
and Carolyn Miller. V

“Do I have to think about that
right now?" Bruce said. “It’s
going to be a sad day around
here. I don't want to think about
it.“
