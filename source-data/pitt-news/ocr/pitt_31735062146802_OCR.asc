Students will be able to register
more rapidly than was possible in
September, when nearly 6,000, un-
dergraduates go to Syria Mosque to-
morrow,‘Friday and Saturday to ar-
range their second semester sched-
ules, registration ofﬁcials indicated
early this week. With many sched-
ules which will only have to -be dupli-
cated, and with only a handful of new
students entering, it is believed that
the registration line will move more
rapidly than ever before. . «

Only new freshmen will register
as a group, J. G. Quick, registrar,
states, all other students being ad-
mitted indiscriminately according to
the number on their trial study lists.
Incoming freshmen will register from

U   This Term, Tentative Plainsi Indicate

 

-9 to 11 o’clock tomorrow morning.
Tentative statistics on the num-
ber of students who will regzster
were drawn up from the number of
study lists taken outby undergrad-
uates last week.‘ The college leads
other schools, with approximately
2,000 planning to signup. Over 1,000
will be registered in the_.school of
education, 670 in the ‘graduate school,
610 in the school of business admin-
istration, 360 in the school of engi-
neering, and 90 in the school of
mines.. All ﬁgures, given are only
approximate, registration officials
stated.’ —. ’ , e . ‘
Students in the medical, -dental and

other graduate schools will register
in their own, schools, it was stated.

Faculty, Students Sec
V Value In Final Exams

Faculty and students in general
seem to agree thatﬁnal exams are
worth the trouble, interviews show.
Finals give the student opportunity
to get a comprehensiv view of his
semester’s study, it is believed.

Dr. M. O. McKay, head of the eco-
nomics department, believes that
they are necessary. “Generally pro-

fessors areable to tell by the marks
from quizzes‘ throughout the semes-

ter what tthe »'student will make as.‘

a ﬁnal grade. -"However, by-a ﬁnal
test the student graspsthe subject
as a whole.”
Dr. M. L.
-science department, says, “The
nervous strain of the student tak-
ing an. ‘exam is iallthe bunk. ‘Tile
student gets hiswork in fragments
and a ﬁnal exam enables him to get
a general view of the course.”
Robert D. Ayars; assistant pro-
fessor of accounting, does not give
ﬁnals V in This course. .“When given,
however, I do not believe the ﬁnal
exam‘ should count more than one-
third of the ﬁnal mark,” he stated.
Ford Curtis, instructor in Eng-
lish, said, “I believe in ﬁnals for
they tend to makefthe course a
unit. They hold the. work up for
the poor as‘ well as good student.”
Paul Schupp, of ‘the history d_e-
partment", does. -not believe in
"springing questions in a two-hour
test. “I am ‘in favor ‘ofgiving. an
analytical or problem type of test
in’ which the student uses‘ all the
material in the course in a paper,
on-which he has sufficient time to
work." Otherwise, a ﬁnal ‘is anab-

normal. device rather,.than anything, ,.

else.”

philosophy department, said, ‘‘All

exams are for the student’s bene-

ﬁt. Their functions‘ are to give an
‘opportunity to the instructor to
judge the quality of the student’s

work,‘ and to indicate to the" stu-_.

dent where his preparation and

grasp of ‘the. subjectis satisfactory.

or unsatisfactory. The more oppor-
tunity the student has V-to
himself the better it is'for the stu-
dent.”.

S. H. Kimball and P. G. Hoe1,_ in- V

structors in mathematics, believe

the student to obtain a view of the
course as a whole. * - _
' Some studentsbelieve that cram-
ming for exams permits the stu-
dent to pass if he has not studied
much before. ‘That they cannot do
any haarm was the general opin-

 Americans.” V i _
 Thus Benny 'i.eonard,.- retired

, ’ ed’ the American college against the
  grecent zittack by Sir Harry ‘Lauder.
  --Lauder. claimed two weeks. ago,
.1  :;through the _We‘ekly, that the
V - - “American college student is al-
 . «lowed too much rope.” ,
,  Leonard said that if Lauder re-
 aeferred to the extra-curricular ac-
“ tivities. -Lauder is off the trail. The
~ ‘-champ thinks that ifthere is any
 fault to find with athletics in Amer-
 ican colleges, all he would say is
‘Vthat there are not enough branches
-offered and developed within the
colleges today. -
‘, “Whyuis it that America consist-
entlyturns out better athletes at
V the Olympic games?” said Leonard,
~;“th'e majority of the American rep-
.,resentati-ves at the Olympic games
-are’ college men.”
- “No, I can’t -hardly agree with
Lauder,” the title-holder said, “I
do not‘-think that the college stu-
 dents in“ America get too much lee-
V Way.»
 Leonard said -that he was poor
V -when young and had no opportun-
ity to, attend college. “It is the
 one thing-of my life that I regret,”
_-he said.
 Leonard, the pugilist, certainly is
out Vef his clime as Leonard, the

goers than boxing fans, but I’d
rather box. A ‘pug-ilist is a slave of
the public‘. My friends tell me that
ﬁghtiVng,.is my line. I’m going back
to it. ’

When asked if he read much,
Leonard said that he‘ had, but he
preferred not to mentionhis. favor-
ite books. ‘ ‘

When told of Lauder’s views on
the American college student, Leon-
ard said that, he had 1s.poken~‘-to
Lauder several“ months “ago on the
same question. ._They disagreed on
their opinions of college men in
America. “I’m all for ~-the-Ainerican
college man and college girl, though

he said. ‘ .“Newertheless,” " he- con-
cluded, ‘-‘I think the proper expan-
sion of athletics for girls as. well
as men in colleges. will tend toward
the development of bigger and bet-

ter Americans.” I .
