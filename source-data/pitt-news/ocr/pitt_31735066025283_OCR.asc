Safety forum garners new ideas for security

By Christine Hanna
and Gary Knapick
The Pitt News

Students had a chance to voice their concerns and suggestions
about campus safety at a four-hour session of the vice
chancellor's open forum on campus safety. _

The nine—member Presidential Task Force on Safety and
Security presented recommendations for reducing crimes
against Pitt students. The task force also took questions and

criticism from the audience to better understand the needs of ’

the student population.

Director of Human Resources John Wilds said the only way
anything will be solved with the safety of the _campus
community is if students, staff and faculty work together
collectively. .

Transportation subcommittee chair Herb Chesler presented
a report that made many suggestions for improving the current
transit system. Before presenting the committee’s
recommendations however, Chesler warned that the group’s
brainstorming was not constrained by any budgetary ceiling.

“We are thinking big,” Chesler said. He feels that it is
necessary to distinguish between long—term and short—term
problems.

“You can’t solve all problems at all times,” Chesler said.

Immediate concerns include the opening of the new dorm
next fall, which will present “an enormous logistical problem,”
according to Chesler. . '

Recommendations of the transportation subcommittee.

include the establishment of an office of campus transportation
independent of the Department of Public Safety. Officers from
the public safety department who currently drive the university's
two shuttles should be replaced by full-time drivers. A

“The sense is ﬂoating around that [using campus police
Officers to drive the shuttles] is a diversion of trained and
needed personnel,” Chesler said.”Students have also expressed
that the drivers seem like they would rather be doing
something else."

The subcommittee also recommended that bus stops for
new bus routes are moved near emergency telephonesand
that «comprehensible, “route-focused” maps are produced.

’ By incorporating the complaints of students at past meetings
into the recommendations, Chesler said he is “using the
weight of the committee to support what the students have put
beforeius,” , A

A {similar proposal submitted by theastudent Government
Board ; recognized the insufficiency of the existing transportation
system and the burden that the new 612-bed residence hall
will place on any future system. The proposal listed several

Pitt to open
Needleman
proceedings

By Heather Gahres
Staﬂ" Writer

The_ University Senate
unanimously to allow Dr. Herbert
Needleman’s research integrity hearings
to be open to the public at yesterday’s
meeting. :

Needleman is being investigated fo
allegations of research misconduct in his

landmark 1979 ﬁndings which showed , ~
low levels of lead exposure can be harmful -

to children.
Needleman asked for the proceedings

to be open to the public for three reasons. _

The first reason was that these hearings

could effect the strict regulations to prevent

lead toxology inforced by the
Environmental‘ Protection Agency. '
“There are much greater stakes than my
own interests. The EPA has been attacked

by the [lead] industry for their regulations .

that go back to 1972 that my research
helped to install,” he said.

Needleman said that the lead industry‘

attacked his misconduct to change the
standing regulations. “[The integrity
hearings] are sponsored by the lead
industry,” Needleman said.

The two scientists that reported

Needleman’s alleged misconduct have both ’

been supported by the lead industry in
their own research, according t.o
Needleman.

“The one’s research has been supported
by the lead industry, and the other onehas
been a‘ paid witness for the lead industry
in a number of court actions,” Needleman
said. ‘ , ‘

Another reason is that the University of
Pittsburgh's Medical School has arguably
the worst reputation in the country for
dealing with allegations of fraud, according
to Needleman.

After submitting a nine page report
defending himself against the allegations
of misconduct, Needleman said that when
he received the final version of the
investigating com'mittee’s report, it
contained things h_e had already refuted.

This explained his lack of confidence in

closed proceedings.

Student Government members, editor breachpolicy

' members Jacob Brody and Ross

Pasquale violated SGB policy,
according to SGB President Gil
Golden, when they appointed
former Pz'ttNewssports editor Rob
Mazur to a Senate Budget Policies

Committee seat without informing ’
T the other members of the SGB.

Golden said he neither received
nor signed a letter that Brody and
Pasquale wrote to Chairperson
Edward Symons, recommending
that Mazur replace Brody on the
BPC. Brody and Pasquale also
failed to follow standard
appointment procedure when
they did not bring the
appointment up at that week’s
planning session, according to
Golden.

Golden said that he didn’t
receive a copy of the letter and
called it “very peculiar” because

he said he is supposed to receive
a copy of all SGB outgoing mail. K

The BPC, which advises the
University Budget Committee, has
two student seats which are
appointed by the SGB. Mazur has
attended two of the committee
meetings this semester.

Brody said that the omissions

of procedure were an oversight
and that he had informally asked
Mazur if he would attend
meetings.

“There was, I guess, some mix- a

up in paperwork, where Gil didn’t
receive a copy [of the letter to the

another oversight on Ross’ and

it up for the board's approval.

“It wasn’t like we were trying

Delegation Zobbiesfor student bills in Hozrrisbu

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

While state legislators ponder
the creation of two laws that
would affect college students,
student representatives from Pitt
traveled to Harrisburg to
encourage their legislatures to
pass such measures.

Making fifth-year under-
graduates eligible for financial
aid and requiring colleges to open
campus—police reports to the
public were the goals of the
Student Government Board
Governmental Relations
Committee’s lobbying trip to
Harrisburg on Tuesday.

The bills the GRC'lobbied for

taken in criminal or disruptive
incidents, and that the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency make financial
aid available to ﬁfth—year students.

Six members from the
governmental—relations
committee met with state
legislators to discuss two bills
which are currently being
lobbied for by campuses across
the state.

House Bill No. 366 was
introduced to enable
undergraduate students to be
eligible for five years of financial
aid from PHEAA. As of now, a
student’s aid is cut off after the
fourth year of undergraduate
work.

The SGB pointed out that only
36 percent of Pitt students
graduate within four years, and

PHEAA should be revised. A few
of the reasons why a fifth year is
necessary for many students in
order to graduate are that some
students work during the terms,
have majors that require five years
of undergraduate work to meet
requirements or change majors.

“We were told the PHEAA bill
needs two revisions: the two M’s
—— merit and money, which it
doesn’t have,” SGB board member
and liaison to the governmental-
relations committee Bryan Bender
said. -

Senate Bill 1378 would require
colleges and universities to

safety. The police would be
accountable for their actions, and
students would know the specifics
of campus safety, the
governmental-relations
committee said.

“The main objectives are first,
accountability, and second, it’s
pro—active. It will tell the people
where crimes are occurring and
the areas they should avoid. The
incident this weekend is a good
example of why we need this,”
Bender said.

The lobbying sessions went
well, said Colleen McCabe, chair
of the GRC.

The committee is optimistic
about the future of the bill
regarding the_open crime logs.
However McCabe said bill 566,
concerning PHEAA, will be hard
to get through this year due to the
budget cuts.

Rosenberg said that by opening
the hearing it would violate the
university’s existing research
integrity policy, which states that
the proceedings shall be closed

-‘Rosenberg also said that the
reasons for a closed proceeding
was not only to protect the
accused; but also to protect the
rights of the witnesses and the

Needleman also criticized that

male, Hill, said. Rather, it is ignorance and
fear.

“Privilege, which many straight, white
men have, makes it easy to remain ignorant,
and those who are privileged to have
power are fearful of those who don’t,” she
said.

Answering the second question, Hill
said that gays and lesbians need not limit
themselves to only their issues, that they
need to realize that other organizations
struggle in the same way.

“There is a pressure for me to be either

- black identified or gay and lesbian
identified,” Hill said. “Whatl would really
like is a space wheregl am a person."

She wasn’t advocating that all of society
be controlled by one group, either. “I’m a
little biased. I happen to like African-i
American lesbians,” she said. “But if the

‘ world tomorrow became African-

American-lesbian-controlled, it would not
be right. Sometimes when I ‘m mad I feel
it would be better, but I’m not mad long,
and it wouldn’t be right.”

. Coalitions must be formed within the
lesbian and gay community. Three things
must be done to form coalitions, she said.

“First, we must find allies, and to do that
we must realize that the world does not
revolve around lesbian and gay issues.

Second, we have to get off of it that we are
the most oppressed, and finally we need to
support other communities,” she said.

Although "groups must work together
and attack diverse issues, individuality is
very important, Hill said. As director of the
Mayor’s Office for the Lesbian and Gay
Community,.she said she “has spent the
past two years believing that one person
can make a difference.”

“I honestly believe that our success is
contingent upon our individual ability to
decide how, not if, we are to make a
difference," she said.

Making a difference involves educating
the bigots at all levels of society, Hill said.

“There are moments when I feel sorry for
bigots, because they really miss out [on the]
world. It’s like being color—blind,” Hill said.
“Like being in a world where there are 10
shades of view and only being able to see
one.” .

Outing, when a gay or lesbian person
openly tells people their sexual orientation,
is not absolutely necessary to change
society’s attitudes, Hill said.

“Look at it this way. We can take two
students — one who is ‘out’ about their
‘Pittness,’ wearing Pitt 't—shirts, pants and
jackets, and one who is not,” she said. “We
still know they are students.”

But gays and lesbians who come out

should not be made to feel uncomfortable
about it, just as a student in Pitt clothes
wouldn’t feel uncomfortable, Hill said.

“People say, ‘Why do you have to tell
everyone?’ Heterosexuals do it all the time.
The best example is Feb. 15, when general
conversation is about this girl’s wonderful
boyfriend or this woman’s husband who
gave her a ring,” she said. “Now ifvl said,
‘My lover gave me six dozen roses and
she...’ Well, all of a sudden I have said
something inappropriate. People just get
weird.” '

It is important that the public know that
straight people are being affected by
homophobia, Hill said. As an example, she
talked about cases where straight people
were beaten up for looking gay.

Another example of homophobia
occurred this year when the Irish Lesbian
and Gay Organization of NYC was barred
from marching in the St. Patrick’s Day
parade. Hill’s advice to an Irish man in the
audience who wanted to organize his own
gay group to march in Pittsburgh’s parade
next year. was, “Ask someone at the top. If
they are smart, they’ll let you in.” The
organizers of this year’s parade made a
huge political mistake when they didn’t
allow the gays and lesbians to march. “Un-
less you are, like, super bigot, you have to

see that it is totally wrong,” she said.

Calabrese dismissed Mazur after
Brody accompanied him and two
other Pitt News staffers to New
York on a Pitt News trip covering
the Panthers in the Big East
tournament. Calabrese said that
she had previously reprimanded
Mazur for allowing Brody press
privileges to Pitt basketball games
and for campaigning for Brody’s
SGB bid last fall.

“The relationship between The
Pitt News and the SGB is one that
has to be handled.very carefully,”
Calabrese said. “I felt that Rob
was "compromising the proper
distance that we have to keep

STUDENTS

from the SGB in order to maintain
an objective stance at the
newspaper.”

Mazur said he did not
understand that it was against
policy to ask Brody to go along
on the‘New York trip and that he
thought it was an overreaction by
The Pitt News to fire him; .

“Brody bought his own ticket
to the Big East tournament,” Mazur

i said. “He got a ticketto the Boston

College game at home, but he
was helping me at that game.”
Brody said when he took press
privileges to the basket ball game,
“it was in the capacity of a friend

that I went to the basketball
games with Rob,” he said. “We
can’t be SGB representatives 24
hours a day.”

Calabrese said the main issue -
was not that Brody went on The '

Pitt News ’money but that ThePz'tt
News’ editors must maintain
certain standards.

“When we see situations like
this going‘ on in other student
groups,‘ we always write articles
about it,” she said, “so we have
to hold ourselves to the highest
standards of making sure that
these things do not go on in our

I organization. ”

recommendations for revamping
the current transit system.

According to the proposal, the
campus bus system requires an
additional bus in order to
adequately serve the students.
Other SGB suggestions for
improving the bus system include
extending weekday hours of
operation and creating a
weekend schedule. Presently,
campus buses do not run on
weekends. I

. In order to improve the shuttle
system, the SGB would like to
see the purchase of three
additional shuttles.

The shuttles would follow three
circuits through Oakland serving
the stadium and Trees Hall area,
North Oakland and South
Oakland. _

According to SGB member
Jacob Brody, the proposed routes
have been taken directly from
the old South and North Oakland
shuttle routes. These routes have
been expanded to include all
areas where students reside and
attend classes and sporting events
around Oakland.

In addition to these changes,
the SGB advocated several minor
improvements, including posted
and well-lit bus and shuttle stops
where a bus would stop every
ten minutes.

SGB said that it is also
recommending an extension of
hours. It would like the shuttle to
run from 6 a.m. until 3 a.m. five
to seven days a week. The board

would like the campus bus system
to extend its hours to 6:27 a.m. to
12:41 a.m. instead of the current
schedule of 7:27 a.m. to 10:41
p.m.,

The main concern of this
proposal is that students have
safe, efficient and reliable
transportation.

The monetary recommendation
to Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor
for the new transportation
proposal will be $600,000, up
from $120,000.

The implementation of these
changes will not be cheap.
According to Chesler, a “modest
fee” of 25 to 50 dollars may be
imposed on all students to help
defray the cost of the
transportation improvements.
Students should not have to “pay
out of the pocket” to ride the bus
or shuttle, he explained.

One of the few students present
at the meeting expressed his
approval of the tuition increase.
“You’ve only got one life,” he
said.

SGB member Barbara
Rodriguez said that students are
already nickeled and dimed with
computer and activities fees and

might object to the tuition
increase. Rodriguez suggested
that money is diverted from other
sources.

According to Chesler, all
university transportation will be
equipped to transport
handicapped students.

. The SGB wants to see the van-
call system retained. That system,
put in place after a Pitt student
was sexually assaulted last fall,
was both praised and berated at
yesterday’s meeting.

“This van-call system works. It
really, really, really works,” said
SGB President Gil Golden.
Director of Public Safety William
Brennan said that van-call
ridership was growing “by leaps
and bounds.” A

“Some students may be abusing
the system,” said Vice President
of Student Affairs William
Harmon, who cited examples of
students ‘using the telephone-
dispatched vans to pick up pizzas
and go to bars. _

Harmon asked that students
not use the vans for social activities
because they are needed by other
students with more legitimate

Golden later said that any use
of the system was good use if it
was keeping students safe.

“If they want to go to a party, or
even a bar, at least we’re keeping
them off the streets. If they're just
downright lazy, at least we’re
keeping them from running
alone,” Golden said.

A number of students
complained to Brennan about
rude van drivers, and Brennan
once again extended his invitation
to student complaints about any
officers.

“Take the time to drop me a
line,” Brennan said, adding that
this would help to open lines of
communication.

A student brought up the
prospect of developing an escort
service.

SGB member Jacob Brody said
that the prospect is being

UCLA.

“If students are not going to _

Brody said.

If the program would go
through, volunteers would need
to take self-defense and C.P.R.
courses.

The volunteers would carry"

two-way radios to stay in contact
with the main office. _

Chesler recognized the Inter-
Fraternity Council’s proposal for
a transportation service on nights
of registered parties. “It is the first
step of sharing" the responsibility
of protecting ourselves,” Chesler
said.

Violence demands action .

Early Sunday morning a female Pitt student was raped
while jogging home along University Drive. A rr1ale
suspect attacked her from behind, restrained her arms and
dragged her off to the hillside.

According to another Campus Crime Alert released this
week, two armed, masked men robbed two Pitt students
between Oakland Avenue and Bouquet Street on Friday
night around 7:50.

Violence on campus is not a new issue for university
students. Last November a female student studying in
Forbes Quadrangle was taken at gunpoint and sexually
assaulted behind the Katz School of Business. The exact

' measure of the problem may never be accurately recorded.

As students, faculty, staff and administration, we are
painfully aware that violence will impact all of our lives
in Oakland and at the University of Pittsburgh.

Whether we feel safe in our university buildings late at

. night, in the middle of -the day or whether wefeel safe’

leaving buildings at night, violence and the threat of

» violence inhibits our actions and a collective sense of

well-being.

Central to any discussion concerning crime and violence
are public-safety" officers. Although they "cannot be
omnipresent, the Department of Public Safety and its
director, William Brennan, once again have come under
attack with the latest wave of crime at Pitt.

Student Government Board members have questioned

Brennan’s response to a 2.7-percent decrease in allocation l

for public safety. .
The Student Government Board safety comrr1ittee is
currently rallying support against a 2.7-percent budget cut
for the university’s Department of Public Safety. While
Brennan is not responsible for cuts, SGB board member
Derrick St. Clair has pointed out, “lBrennanl should be
talking to the administrators who are responsible, and he

‘is not doing that. Therefore the students must.” The safety

comrnittee’s petition opposing the budget cuts is a first
step for students to empower themselves on campuswide
issues. '

Cutting public-safety funds is not an acceptable budgetary
move by the administration. Maintaining the same level of
spending on public safety is equally unacceptable.

An increase in appropriations for public safety at Pitt is

proper and justified. It's that simple. ’
. Hiring more officers for basic patrols is an option. Hiring
women in particular with specific training to address
sexual assault is another action that would be wise on the
part of the university administration. .

Education campaigns for students are an alternative

i already explored; however added emphasis on crime’

prevention, reporting and follow—up can add to a unified

approach to campus violence in areas of assault, robbery
and rape.

It is improper to hurt or

. purposely endanger the lives of

our prisoners of war.

Police officers are not allowed «

to use force during questioning,
an arrest or an investigation if it is
not called for. Teachers are not
allowed to punish students by
force in our Country’s public
schools. But new Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas would
like to see that change..

A In -a recent decision the
Supreme Court declared the use
of excessive force illegal in the
Country’s prison systems. Justice
Thomas dissented, saying that
the Supreme Court stepped over
the bounds of proper

. interpretation. He stated, “The

expansion of the cruel and
unusual punishment clause  is
yet another manifestation of the
pervasive view that the federal

Constitution must address all ills ‘

in our society.” He went on to say

. that “it does not mean that [abusive C

and deplorable behavior by
prison guards] is invariably
unconstitutional.”

The Constitution, despite what
Justice Thomas may think, is and
was written to protect the people.
Cruel and unusual punishment is
prohibited and should stay that
way. Making exceptions for
prisoners is an outrage. The
constitution was set up for “We,
the people," not just certain
sections of that “we.” Whether
people are good or bad, right or
wrong, the Constitution was

Liberty land   justice for some

created to protect them all. When
you start to make exceptions like
Justice Thomas did, you are
violating not only the rights of

Joshua
Silverman

the persons at stake, but all
people. What if the case that
came before the Supreme Court
had declared that cruel and
unusual punishment or use of
excessive force was okay, but
only for blacks or Jews or
homosexu_a1s or children? I
wonder what kind of opinion
Justice Thomas would have had
then.

Prisoners are in jail for a reason.
They are there to serve out the
time v declared enough
punishment by the courts of the
United’ States. Prisons are
overcrowded, dangerous, violent
and probably below the standard
of living to begin with. Prisoners’
life is hard enough just serving
the time for their crimes. They do

not need a bunch of sadistic

prison guards beating them for
the fun of it. Justice Thomas
would allow for that.

Justice Sandra Day, O’Connor
said that when prison officials
use any type of “force to cause
harm, contemporarystandards of
decency always are violated.” That
is what is atstake here. If excessive

force was allowed in the prisons,
the Eighth Amendment would
lose all meaning. The ﬂood gates
would open, and rules governing

‘proper punishment on all levels

would be challenged.

The days of the hickory stick or
the ruler across the knuckles died
out a long time ago. Justice

Thomas wants to see that brought

back. His loose interpretation of
the Constitution to subjugate a
class of people that he finds
displeasing borders on Nazism. It
is bias. ‘
Perhaps our new justice should
take another look at civil rights
and the Bill of Rights that protect

him as a human and a citizen, not _

just as a justice of the Supreme
Court. C _

The United States is still a very
young country. We have a lot to
‘learn. And if protections founded
in the Constitution are not
defended on all counts, not just
speciﬁc ones or when they apply
to specific people, then blacks,
women, children and all other
people who are not white, upper-
class males would be unprotected.
We would regress to the point of
our origin.

We should not forget what
rights we fought so hard for to
establish in these last 200 years.
America is a land of “We, the
People,” and it should stay that
way.

Gag rule binds medical professionals

The Bush Administration is again putting a spin
on its gag rule, denying a poor woman the right to
be dealt with honestly about her legal option to
have an abortion, Late last week it declared that

clinics partially funded with Title
X money are now allowed to tell
women that abortion is legal and
to give referrals to clinics which
perform abortions.’ D

As you note in your editorial of March 23, the
catch is that under Bush’s latest ﬂip-ﬂop, only
medical doctors are allowed to do this counselling.
Nurses, social workers and other professionals are
still banned from discussing abortion with pregnant
women. Since doctors’ time is more expensive than

other medical professionals 

 When I wrote to President Bus,h.las,t_Au'turnn,,_ _,  _ ,_ 1

Letters  

a special assistant to the President wrote back

denying that his policy —— which directly reversed
more than 15 years’ interpretation of Title X policy
— consisted of a gag on clinics at all.

This issue is not about the government's providing

or paying for abortions to women
who can’t afford them. It is strictly
about the Control of information
and whether the federal

government will continue to interfere with health-
clinic professionals who need to provide pregnant
women with honest and accurate information about
their legal medical options. Bush’s latest move still
violates the purpose of Title X: to provide quality
care and honest information to people who can’t
afford it on their own.

Thirty-four games. That’s

season lasted, and I’m
probably not the only one

After Monday’s loss to
Florida, Darren Morningstar
was sitting in the locker room
talking about the game. He
just sort of shook his head
and said, “It’s been an awfully V
long season.”

This from a senior,
someone who might be used 1
to the rigors of a full season
of hoops against college
competition. You can’t fault
Mornings_tar, though,
because the season was
probably longer mentally

. than physically for the
players.

At the other end of the

Hovan named NCAA

Scott Hovan doubled his
pleasure at last weekend's NCAA
Wrestling Championships.

Not only did he become a" two-
time All-American by placing
fourth at the 158-pound weight
class, but in the process, he
knocked off Penn State’s Tim
Wittman, who upset Hovan in
the Eastern Wrestling League
Finals less than three weeks ago.

The nationals marked the end
of an outstanding season for Pitt,
which saw the Panthers finish

last season’s 27th-place finish at
the NCAAs. In. addition, the
Panthers grabbed the‘ No. 20

ranking in the ﬁnal coaches’ dual— S

meet poll- .

“We were pleased to do what
we did. It sure wasn’t a bad year
4 finishing in the top 20 in dual-
meet rankings and in tournament
rankings,” Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said.

Hovan,_ the senior from

on an illustrious career by

finishing fourth in Oklahoma City. '

over Arizona State’s Ray Miller,
Smith has won the national title
three straight times.

On his All-American run Hovan
avenged two of his four losses
from this season. He defeated
Tenness'ee—Chattanooga,’s
Howard Langford, who pinned
him earlier this season. Then in
the consolation semifinals, Hovan
decisioned Wittrnan 7-‘S, avenging

regretted not letting Wittman up
after taking him down because
Wittrnan ended up reversing him
twice for costly points.

“I thought Scotty wrestled a
real smart match,” Stottlemyer
said. “We certainly changed the
strategy a little bit, taking him
down and letting him up.”

Stottlemyer said it was a
satisfying win for Hovan _and a
bout that both Hovan and
Wittrnan will remember.

“The only one that counts is the
last one, not the one from before,”
Stottlemyer said.

o fill void

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Sports Writer

Football player Jeff Craig may
be the biggest recruit for the Pitt
fall sports teams for next season.
But if you listen to the Panther
volleyball coaches, Jennie Driscoll
may be the best. A

Driscoll, a 6—foot middle hitter,

is one of five recruits trying to fill’
the void left by the graduation of .
six seniors from Pitt’s‘four—time 

defending Big East champion
volleyball team.

These six seniors were four
starters and the team’s top two
reserves. Starters Dee MacAulay,
Heather Hollands, Sue Zonneville
and Linda Zols and reserves
Bridget Gary and Shelly Seanor
won conference titles each of
their four years at Pitt and were a

big ‘part of the program going i

from a. contender in a weak

conference to a Top 25 team, as.

it was in the 1990-'91 season. The
team ranked much of last season
and dominated the conference,
losing onlyone game and no

matches in Big East competition. '

Adding to questions on the
team, outside hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie, 1991 Big East Player of
the Year and Most Outstanding
Player award—winner in the last
two conference tournaments, is
recovering from ankle surgery.

Rugby wins first spring matches

Sports Editor

The Panther Rugby Football

Club opened its spring season
with road wins over
Westminster Rugby Club and
Youngstown Rugby Club.
' On March 7 the Panthers
beat Westminster, 11-3, on the
strength of solid team play.
Being the first match of the
semester, however, the team
was a bit rusty in its execution,
according to team member
John Lewis. .

“In the first match, we lacked
the support that we had during
the fall,” he said. “But by the
second match, our
organization and support was
coming back.”

They needed that
organization against their
second opponent,
Youngstown, which fielded a
physically larger team

comprised of mostly adult
. players. Still, Pitt posted a 17-

O victory, scoring all of its

points in the second half.

“We were sluggish in the
first half,” said Lewis, “but our
teamwork and organization
just overpowered them, even
though they were bigger.”

Scoring tries for the Panthers

_one match short. Miller, the
sixth seed, won his first two
bouts and advanced
unblemished to the
quarterﬁnals. There he fell to
the third seed, Iowa State’s
Jamie Cutler. He needed to win
the next bout to place among
-the top eight and garner All-
American status, but he had
the unfortunate draw of facing
Oklahoma State’s Kirk
Mammen, the fourth seed.
Miller’s loss to Mammen closed
his season at 27-4. Despite the
results, Stottlemyer said he still
views Miller as an All-American.
“Perry did a good job. He
had a bad draw,” Stottlemyer
said. “It’s a shame. Cutler was
pretty tough, and Mammen
ended up placing. It’s ashame
because Perry’s definitely one
of the top eight heavyweights
in the country in my opinion.”
Miller was not the only
returningAll—Americanwhodid
not place Only 34 of S2
returning managed to place in
the top eight this year.
Stottlemyer attributed this to
the tough atmosphere of
nationals.
“You either do it, or you

don't. And a lot of kids who
were No. 2 or 3 seeds got beat
in the first couple rounds,”
Stottlemyer said.

“Perry has nothing to hang
his head about. He’s had a
tremendous career, and he’s
gone above and beyond what
people expected of him,”
Stottlemyer said. _

Junior Sean Gibbs (167) and
sophomore Jeff Kloiber (190)
also competed at Oklahoma
City, but they both suffered
defeats in the opening round.
Kloiber lost to the eighth seed
from Northern Iowa, getting
taken down in the final 30
seconds.

“Jeff had the worst draw you
can get,” Stottlemyer said. “I
was hoping that he would do
better. Hopefully, Jeff realizes
he has to come back next year
right where he’s at now. He
can’t lose ground."

Gibbs had the unfortunate
draw of meeting the defending
national champ from Iowa in
the opening match. Stottlemyer
said that being at nationals for
the first time had an effect on
Gibbs.

“You could tell it was his first
time there,” Stottlemyer said.

the rehab is going well. She
rebounds [from injury] well. I
expect her back, and after sitting
out the spring, maybe even
stronger.”

Lucanie’s return is a key. So is
the development of last season’s
reserves. The setter spot is in the
very capable hands of Annemarie
Mernagh. First—year players
Chelsea Hemingway, Melanie
Gustafson, Tracy Komar and
redshirt freshman Carrie Thornton
will try to fill in after limited
playing time last season. Woodstra
said everyone is working hard,
but she would give no indication
of any of them having an inside
track on starting next season.

The five recruits will have a lot
to say about that — especially
Driscoll.

“She has the kind of potential
in the middle that Ann Marie
Lucanie has on the outside,” said

assistant coach Cindy Braziel, who -

is in charge of recruiting. “She
should be newcomer of the year
in the Big East. We expect her to
be an All-American someday. She
is what we call a blue-chip recruit
in anybody’s book and can be a
dominant player.”

in Chicago, ranked No. 3 in the
country last season, will join her
at Pitt. Laura Horvath is a 5-4
defensive specialist who also
gives the Panthers depth at setter.
She is experienced, with eight
years of club volleyball under her
belt. Woodstra pointed to her
ability to control the ball as a key
since that is something Woodstra
stresses for her team. She and
Braziel both pointed to attitude
as a key ingredient of Horvath’s
game.

“She’s the kind of girl you
expect to come in and be a team
captain very soon,” Braziel said.
“She is incredibly mature,
sparkling and hyper—intense.”

Intensity was also a word
Braziel used to describe Elyssia
Yanik, a 5-11 outside hitter from
South Haven High School in South
Haven, Mich. Yanik is the least-

experienced of the incoming‘

class, butshe is a top—notch athlete
whom Braziel compares to
Zonneville. Yanik already has a
connection to the Panthers,
having played on a club team
with Mernagh.

One player who could help at
outside hitter is Hammond, Wis,
native Sarah Mikla. Woodstra said
the St. Croix Central High School
senior can play either the middle

or outside and is an excellent
player at the net.

“She’s very consistent, very well
trained,” Braziel said. “She’s an
all-around solid player, not at all
ﬂashy.”

From Braziel’s description, Sara
Mitchell of Columbia Heights
High School in Fridley, Minn., is
the exact opposite.

“She’s very quick and dynamic,” ,

Braziel said. “She has good ball
control. She’s great defensively,
and she’ll be very tough to deal
with offensively because she is
very quick to the ball.”

Woodstra also pointed out that
the 5-9 left-hander is a “heady
player,” who can also provide
depth at setter.

Both coaches are very high on
all five players, especially Braziel,.
in her second season at Pitt after
two seasons as assistant coach at
Wyoming and two years at Texas
A&M.

“In eight years of recruiting,
this is one of the most exciting
groups I’ve been around,” Braziel
said. “I think we have a very
good shot at winning the Big
East.”

“All five players come in with
excellent experience,” Woodstra
said. “They are used to a good
level of volleyball.” I

harmoniously embrace to form a
vivacious, cocksure demeanor
that spells pure gold.

Throughout the band’s self-
titled 11-track release, Baby
Animals, DeMarchi and company
churn out a veritable firestorm of
ferocious forays as well as stark,
juicy, midtempo ballads. And
while the compilation features
capable wattage from lead
guitarist Dave Leslie, bassist Eddie
Parise and backbeat Frank
Celenza, DeMarchi is the reason
to believe, the reason to buy and
the reason to listen.

Her dominating presence takes
flight in the album’s first single
“Painless,” in which ‘ the
anticipation of Suze’s heated
vocals created by the stark intro

' (“You want to feel a little warmth,

a little mercy”) are realized in a
hopping jaunt driven by a catchy
bass line and jazzed—up
percussion work.

The tempo and volume step up
a bit for shallow yet tough tunes
like “One Word,” “Early Warning”
and “Big Time Friends,” the last
of which curiously opens to a
mid—70s, Sonny and Cher-like bass
sound that — believe it or not ——
thrives, survives and makes for a
more than palatable jig.

Lyrically, Baby Animals won’t
make anyone forget rock poets
like Springsteen and Dylan, that’s
for sure. But that’s not what Suze
and the Boys are out for. It’s
simple hard rock with a COCky
attitude.

A prime example of BA’s mood
comes in “Ain’t Gonna Get” —— _a

spiteful, lusty run that purveys
the tempting yet thrusting ‘mood
of DeMarchi with refreshing
vengeful lyric work aimed
towards tail—hungry men (“If all
you want is a_ little piece of ass,
All you get is a_ little piece of
me”). .

In “One Too Many,” Leslie’s
scorching axe-work does musical
intercourse with DeMarchi’s
taunting crooning (“One too
many! I’ve had enough of that
stuff from you —— One too many!
I'm packin’ up I’m through with
you”) to create a tamed, speed-
metal sonic raunch.

While most tracks follow this
devil-may—care attitude, it is the.
presence of two stark yet
captivating ballads like “Make It '
End” and “Break My Heart,” that
shed a‘ blinding light on
DeMarchi’s potential as a major
figure in the rock scene.

WDVE D] splits time between the ‘scene’ and the unseen:

By Tonya Hurley

' Staﬁ‘ Writer

_Sipping on apple—flavored tea, Michele
Michaels sits in the office she shares with
Phil Kirzyc at WDVE-FM. She has just
finished her radio show, “The Electric
Lunch,” and is hoping the tea will help her
snifﬂes. She has a short break before she
has to go over to KDKA-TV and work on
her entertainment piece.

Michaels has managed to have two jobs
in these rough economic times, but more
impressive is having dual work in such a
highly competitive field as the media. She
works the Electric Lunch from 11 a.m. to
3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and

then she does the entertainment report on
KDKA television on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday.

Working two jobs is a trend that Michaels
picked up while she was in college at
Penn State. She managed the college
station, and on the weekends she worked
three shifts at a local commercial station.

“I am not a Type-A personality ingthe
least. I’m not the kind of person who says,
‘I must have more challenges,’ she said in
a hyper voice. “I would be very happy to
sit on my couch and watch cartoons.”

But once she gets involved in something
she gives it her undivided attention,
including her wedding, which took place
a year and a half ago. “I spent a whole year

planning for it,” she said, looking at the
wedding picture on her desk.

Michaels has a husband, a step—son, a
house and two successful jobs. But these
accomplishments didn’t appear magically.
She had a rough journey to get where she
is now. When she graduated from college,
she was offered a position at the nearby
radio station where she worked part time.
She worked there two years for $118 a
week. _

“They know you’re not staying. They
just use you until you gasp for air and just
leave,” she said. “You have to take the
crappy jobs. We have interns here at DVE
that want to start out as Djs, but they’re not
ready.”

Baby

inducing centerpiece of the album,
is a painfully dreamy and peaceful
stroll of emotions drenched with
DeMarchi’s soft, whispering
passion (“The silence is so loud,
it’s deafening. Oh it seems to
hang around, just to threaten me”).
The lullaby kicks in at mid-
slumber with an optimistic, REM-
like energetic gallop to the finish.

Overall, there’s real hope for
fem—jams thanks to Suze and the
rest of Baby Animals.

With a break or two on the US.
rock scene, some improved lyrical
work on future discs and
continued focus on the stellar
existence of Ms. Suze DeMarchi,
Baby Animals just may be the
next big splash from Down
Under.

Michaels also worked summers as a

nurse's aide in a geriatric center. “We used ' '

to have wheelchair races down the halls,"
she said. She said she believes that college
is the time to get all the experience you
can. “Your friends will be out at parties" or
skiing in Vermont, and you’ll be in a

dumpy, little hole of a radio station, but it _ 
J

all worked out,” she said.

Michaels has been through some rough
terrain (including work in Syracuse and
San Francisco for two years apiece after
college), and her advice is crucial for
anyone considering a job in the media.

“Work your butt _off, be yourself and
don’t make up excuses when you fail.

Our picks are better thant: The Oscars

By Brian Berger and

Scot Ross
The Pitt News

Trades and tabloids alike have

[been offering» cash prizes to

devoted readers who can predict
the winners of the Academy
Awards. I-Iampered by our
modest budget, we can't offer an
Atlantic City-like gambling spree,
only our pick, predictions and
ponderings about this Monday's
Oscar festivities, which once
again snub the bizarre and
beautiful in favor of sap and
money in the Academy’s elite,
social-club mentality.

Since who will get it and who
we think should get it will
undoubtedly differ, we’ll serve
up both.

Best Director: John Singleton,
Boyz in the Hood; Barry
Levinson,’ Bugsy; Oliver Stone,
]FK,- Jonathan Demme, The
Silence of the Lambs; and Ridley
Scott, Thelma and Louise.

Ducats bet: Ridley Scott and
John Singleton have no chance
with the Academy. Scott isn’t
making the kind of movies the
industry likes, and despite
Singleton’s impressive debut,
they’ll hedge on him, given his
age of 24 and the fact that he will
have many more chances.
Demme, on the other hand, is in
the same boat as Scott, but he has
a better shot because Hollywood
is more willing to award a film
about a psychopath than a film
that depicts all men as villains.
The Academy loves Barry

on the subject, a.k.a. Ruby), thus
creating a buzz without having to

the country this decade, they’ll

Eugene M. Guy
For T be Pitt News

‘ sDespite the rumor that Pittsburgh’s
nightlife is dead, a group of die-hards
continue to breathe life into clubland. A
wave of rave is sweeping across the Atlantic
and has found its way to Pittsburgh.
“Rave parties originated in London and
then became popular in Los Angeles and
New York,” said Rick Lee, a native New
Yorker and former Bennetton model who
has been responsible for recent rave parties.
“When I was in New York, I was so used
to this [rave] environment that when I
came to Pittsburgh there was like a void.
There was nothing to do. So I take things
that I see in New York and try to establish
them in Pittsburgh. I just want to introduce
this type of atmosphere to the city," Lee
said.
While the atmosphere, like most social

genres, is not easily classified, it is in this
meeting ground where geniuses, marginal
people, dreamers and misﬁts all band
together and share a commonality — to
have fun.

-“Rave is like a movement,” said Rodd
Vano, a Pitt ﬁlm student, “the people, the
clothes, the clubs and the atmosphere.”

The look is one of rebellion and of
daring to be different. Parents often
disagree with the way the younger
generation dresses today, and if they were
to see one of these “ravers” leave the
house, they would probably think they
were going to Mardi Gras. Yet in fact these
young people are draped in clothing that
at times you might find on the runways of
Paris. Baggy jeans,’ catsuits, motorcycle
leather jackets and big, clunky shoes called
Doc Martens are just a few of the things
worn at raves.

When it comes to dancing, and that’s

what the “raves” are all about, anything
goes. Men and women writhe, bob and
gyrate their bodies in positions once
thought humanly impossible without
missing a beat as they surrender themselves
to the big beat.

While Raves can range in musical styles

‘from house to hip—hop, one particular

sound seems to be catching — techno-
rave, which sounds like the world falling
apart to a disco beat.

“The difference between regular house
music and techno—rave is that house is
happy and danceable, whereas rave is
harder with a definitive industrial edge,”

T Lee said. Loud, hostile and funky, techno-

rave music synthesizes the aesthetics of
the avant garde that was with the‘ cyber-
noise of the future. '

Years back, in London, stimulated by
the fast, synthetic beat of House and the
techno—dance psychadelics, hundreds of

people gathered together in large and,
chaotic warehouses illegally — thus the« ~

birth of the rave.

As rave ’s popularity grew, London clubs
had no choice but to incorporate the
parties into their repertoire. Soon raves
were legalized and became weekly, all-
night dance events.

As for the Pittsburgh scene, “Any rave I

event helps Pittsburgh,” said Tony Pfeifer,
art director at the Artery in Shadyside,

where various House and Techno—rave‘
' gigs have been thrown.

“Pittsburgh nightlife is very limited; it’s

monopolized by that ‘industrial club’ -
[Metropol] in the Strip District,” said Jon A

Eisner, an architecture student at Carnegie
Mellon. Thus clubs like The Artery have
tried to cash in on the rave wave that
Pittsburgh is experiencing in hopes of
expanding the scene as well as diversifying
It.

Staff Writer

' Art imitates life in A.R. Gurney’s
new play, The Coc/etail Hour,
which is currently playing at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater. The
central character, John (Mark
Hofmaier), has just finished his
latest play. The subject matter?
His semi-dysfunctional family
with the names changed. The
play’s title? The Cocletail Hour.
Gumey’s play gives us a glimpse
into the frustrations, fears and
desires of his “fictitious” drawing-
room family, while strongly
hinting that the play is semi-
autobiographical. The program
notes mention that Gurney did
not write this play until after his
father’s death, and that he asked

his mother not to see it. The
thread, which appears to tie
together Gumey’s world and that
of the play, is the script of John's
The Cocletail Hour, which is used
throughout the play as a medium
for John to speak with his father
about their estranged relationship.
The entire play takes place
dur-ing the family’s cocktail hour,
which drags on for two and a half
hours because of several mishaps
in the kitchen. During this time
Gurney shows us John’s skewed
relationships with his father,
Bentley (Burt Edwards); his
mother, Ann (Kim Hunter); and
his sister, Nina (Margery Shaw).
The repartee between the four
characters moves the play along
at a fast pace, which is ably
handled by the four actors, all of

whom are excellent.

John is perfectly played by
Hofmaier. He creates a sarcastic,
dry-witted character who is
entirely believable as the
“troublemaker” son of this
comfortable family. Hofmaier’s
reactions to the rest of the family
are the true beauty of his
character, however. Conveying
volumes witha wry grin and a
raised eyebrow, Hofmaier’s John
comments on the action every
second he’s onstage.

Edwards is equally good as the
blustery old Bentley, John’s
conservative father. His character
has a complex mix of rigidity and
vulnerability, which he portrays
incredibly at all times. As well the
rapport he shares with Hunter, as
Ann, is warm and genuine enough

THE prrr~NEWs, Thursday, March 26, 1992

\ Art imitates life in Public T heater’s The Cocktail Hour

to encompass their character’s 50
years together. A true chameleon
in this play, Edwards excels in
the role.

Another ﬁne performance is
that of Hunter as the witty
peacemaker Ann. Attempting to
help smooth the knotty
relationship between her husband
and son, Hunter plays the
character with charm and grace.
Her sense of comedic timing is
the best in the show, and her Ann
is a joy to watch. A nationally
known actress, Hunter is best
known for her award-winning
work in the stage and screen
versions .of A Streetcar Named
Desire, inwhich she played Stella.

Shaw rounds out the cast as the
anxiety-ridden Nina, John’s older
sister. Shaw is sometimes

 

annoying as the whining older-
sister, butshe turns in an adequate
performance as an unlikable
character. She lacks the depth of
the other three characters in her
angry scenes but is still far from a
bad performance.

The elaborate living-room set

of this play also deserves special-

mention. Gary English has created
a comfortable yet imposing space
which mirrors the characters who
live in it. The look is perfect.
Aptly directed by Peter Bennett,
this comedy of manners for the
1990s is a close look at the
restrictive atmosphere from which
many wealthy families suffer. It

explores the tangled relationships .

of the family with an implicit

honesty which is well portrayed _

by the fou r‘ actors.

Michaels

Continued from page S-3
Don’t say, ‘I didn't make it because
I am a woman or I am black.’

‘That’s bull,” she said.

Michaels said she strongly
believes that if you have a vision
and you follow it, you can
accomplish anything.‘ She has
strong advice for people coming
out of college and going into the
media.

“Some people feel it is necessary
to distort their voices to be in the

‘media. The only thing this will I

get you is nodes on your vocal
chords,” she said. The most
important thing is to use your
personality.”

Michaels said success evolved
because she relied on herself.
She is where she wants to be, and
it isn’t all fun and glamour. “I
spent one night watching Dusty
Hill from ZZ Top spit spitballs
into women’s hair at a dumpy
Holiday Inn,” she remembered.

She works some -rough hours,
and she is starting to get
recognized because of; her
television spot. “I can’t go into
the ladies’ room and pee,” she
said “People are outside saying,
‘Michele Michaels is in there,’
and they are standing out there
listening to me pee.”

The reason she puts up with all

 

of it is because she has a driving
passion for rock ‘n’ roll. It is her

first love, and she isn’t considering '

jumping over to television. She
looks at her job at KDKA _as an
opportunity. “Radio people
certainly aren’t for.‘ sure,
employment wise,” she said. .“It

is good to have your foot in a pilot -

of places.” .
“Radio is my life, and television
is icing on the cake. Before there

was MTV, there was us rock Djs,”

she said, finishing up the last of
her tea and getting ready to leave
WDVE and make her way over to
KDKA with her other foot in the
doon- "

Beatty’s on a roll. If his production
with Annette Benning wasn’t
enough, his film Bugsy is a lock
to score best picture.

We Sez: Berger says Slacleer, but

Rose; Bette Midler, For the Boys,-
and Jodie Foster, The Silence of

Ducats bet: The favorite has to
be Jodie Foster because she’s
Won before and the Academy
likes her. No one else has taken
the lead since Foster’s early
accented portrayal made her the
favorite.

Sarandon and Davis would split

Jessica Lange was also overlooked
in the nomination game for her
undaunted mother in Cape

DeNiro, Cape Fear; Robin

Ducats Bet: Scot thinks Nick
Nolte is as close to a sure thing as
you’ll get, and Berger will go
with him despite reservations
about the strong field. The sappy

Academy loves this type of tender-
male portrayal. Let’s see, he’s

to help his sister. Too much family
plot for the Academy to snub
him. DeNiro, who has numerous
performances over the years that
should have won, won’t get his
second Best Actor Oscar for his
over—the-top psychotic, Max Cady.
If it wasn’t for Nolte, Anthony
Hopkins would score the gold.
His Hannibal “The Cannibal”
Lecter sets the “standards” by
which to judge criminal
psychiatrists.

Warren Beatty has a chance,
according to Berger, and Robin
Williams seems to be the forgotten
man in this field. But he could be
