FOK LOGFI E VOOK

The tendency to view education at a four-year
residentialcollege or university as a practical goal,
and thereby represent an opportunity, is radically
diminished as one moves down the socio-economic
ladder. If opportunity is to exist, it must be present
in all the diverse forms dictated by the clientele.

_‘Parochialism dictated by government scholarship is

T inferior to an educational system designed ,to pro-

vide all people with fulﬁllment. _ . ,
Unfortunately, many students who graduate
from high school (and many more who don’t) do
come from lower socio-economic categories and re-
side in_ culturally deprived areas. It follows natural-
ly from previous analysis that these students will
certainly not perceive of their opportunity for
education at Harvard or Yale, nor will the vast
imajority of students from the Hill District view
Pitt or Chatham as an opportunity for a mean-
ingful educational experience as interpreted by
their background. _ i ' -
These same culturally deprived students will be
affected by the presence of the community college.
The intangible orientational inﬂuence of the pre-
sence; of an institution will stimulate’more people
into perceiving higher education as a practical goal,
as Pitt does to some Pittsburghers. The mere presence
of the institution coupled with no-tuition will un-
doubtedly attract more students. But the majority
of the culturally deprived students have value systems
that emphasize more practical aspects of education
(as opposed to the purely academic liberal arts pro,-
gram) and even those students who are mentally
able would not attend. a free University of Pitts-
burgh. , ’ ~
A tuition-free community college, with its
broad curriculum, free education, emphasis on prac-
tical education, and strong identiﬁcation with the
community, will effectively ‘ attract almost every

student who can proﬁt from the education. Scholar- V

ships, loans, and the world on a platter are in-
end school

The United States is showing a
‘ loss in the-_Vietnamese war.

not moving forward quickly,’

‘but they are advancing. AI-
most- every day we can pick up _

money and personnel in Viet Nam.
Obviously, our investment ‘in men and money
in Viet Nam has been unproﬁtable so far. i

The United States government has four al-
ternatives in waging its war iniViet Nam. We
can pull out completely, leaving South Viet‘
Nam to carry on its own war. Second, the
United States could give the Vietnamese mili-
tary aid without advisors to help the Southeast
Asian government run its war. Third; we can
continue with what we are doing now. Fourth,
we could ﬁnally commitment ourselves in Viet
Nam, and wage an all-out war against the
Vietnamese guerillas.

. If we leave the South Vietnamese to carry on
their own war, we will lose that Southeast Asian
country to the Communists. They arelosing the
war now, even with our help, ' Without it," they
would have as much chance of beating the Com-
munists as a Russian roulette player, who has
pulled the trigger ﬁve times in a six—chambered
gun, has of living.

Second, we could give the Vietnamese mili-
tary equipment, and let them_ run it themselves.
This would be as effective as giving a six-year-
old the proper surgical tools, and telling him
he is now equipped to perform appendectomics._

  The eS.ocio-Economic. Laclderi

in a manner such that students recognize it as the
place where they do belong. . -
Having explored the philosophy behind the var-
ious types of two—year institutions, placed them on a
continuum, and announced the community gollege far

the raw cold facts.as to the various degrees of success
achieved by these institutions_._ Surveys done by the

The South Vietnamese, without the proper
technical abilities, would be inept at handling
modern Americanﬂcombat equipment. The ‘new
equipment, in unexperienced hands, would prob-
ably do more harm than good. The Vietnamese
could not win a war with modern equipment un-
less they had the people to use the arms properly.

Third, we could send trainers to teach the
South Viets how to use the modern equipment we
are giving them. This is what we are doing now. _

There were roads and railroads linking North

‘North Viet Nam is not easily accessible." There 7‘?

ﬂare few roads from Communist China "to North ,

It is interesting to observe how near the com-

Aside from offering attractive forces so ‘powerful
as to overcome ﬁnancial and motivational obstacles
to higher education, the community college effective-
ly removes the obstacles and reinforces favorable
attitudes toward higher education. Providing the op-
portunity to live at home, attend school at no cost,

the diverse kinds of ‘educational opportunity. This ’

cannot be done by other institutional approaches

such as Pitt, Chatham, Carnegie Tech, Point Park,‘

and‘ Robert Morris, .but all of these, schools have a
place in _t_he fabric of higher education. They all
provide different kinds of opportunity in different
ways that attract different people. Certain of these
institutions.striv,._e for ideals suited to the type of
education offered, such as the “community of schol-

. ars” approach advocated by‘Dr. Eddy.

To be a successful institution in striving for an
ideal more peculiar to its own type of opportunity,
the community college cannot be a four-year resi-
dential institution. To_ demand that the community
college be abandoned because of this unreasonable
and harmful criticism is to endorse parochialism,
the very situation Dr. Eddy deplores. Demanding
governmental scholarships not only allows such
parochialism,-but actually induces it.

In light of the dynamic role the community col-
lege plays in‘ rounding—out the American educational
system, I argue that governmental aid, if it should
come, (I, make no judgments here) is most meaning-
ful to the public and the structure of higher educa-
formiof greatly expanded support

       

  

 

       

At Clapp Hall Friday

‘La Dolce Vita’

, By CHARLES DENNING .

Friday night at eight o’clock the Student Union Board will
present La Dolce Vita free of charge in Clapp Hall. Due to the
unusual length of this ﬁlm there will be only one showing.

It is not often that a film which hopefully presents itself as

a meaningful motion picture achieves such ubiquitous circulation

as La Dolce Vita has. However, if one remembers the publicity
which surrounded its openingfin this country, he will have no
trouble explaining popularity. It was originally heralded as an
expose of the Roman orgy or as ‘a “sexsational” indictment of

modern society.

The results of such exploitation were unfortunate. Those
who went to the theatre seeking a little slice of pornographywent
home disappointed and the many serious viewers who were in-
terested in the ﬁlm’s artisticworth were repulsed by the type of
publicity. which accompanied its showing. Consequently, it was
passed over in many circles as mere sensationalism. -...-_ J

The movies central ﬁgure is a journalist, played by Marcello
Mastroianni, who’is a. troubled and unhappy man working for a '
cheap Roman tabloid. Since his profession calls‘ for a certain
freedom of movement it 'gives_direi:tor Federico*Fellini a chance
tokfocus on a number of varying themes. The emptiness of sexu-
ality, the commercialization of religion, the intellectual fear of
life, and the insensitivity of mankind are just some of the material
which he covers. Though his treatment might seem glossy it is in

accord with his ‘purpose.

’ The movie’s central ﬁgure is a journalist, playedby Marcello
is passing through anunreal side-show experienc ‘of only surface
depth. But this does not mean that La Dolce Vita is itself lacking
in depth. It’s point is made by ironically reversing the newspaper
realities"-of our society and exposingthem for the dross they are.
