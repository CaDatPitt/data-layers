Eviction decision not settled

ByMGwenn Barney
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Members of the “99 percent” oc-
cupied the Allegheny County Court-
house Wednesday, urging Allegh—
eny County Court of Common Pleas
Judge Christine Ward to allow them
to stay on the 10 percent of Mellon
Green on which they currently reside
Downtown. .

Round 2 of the Occupy Pittsburgh
and BNY Mellonjudicial showdown
concluded Wednesday just after
12:30 p.m. After the cross-exarninae

tions of three more witnesses — all .

either Occupy Pittsburgh members
or supporters ——~ Ward called an end

to the preliminary injunction hear— .

ing, which will determine whether
members of Occupy Pittsburgh may
remain camped on the privately
owned Mellon Green.

BNY Mellon ordered the Occu-
piers to vacate Mellon Green Dec.
11, but the headstrong campers
decisively remained in their tents
and claimed seizure of the park,
renaming it The People’s Park. The
next day, the bank ﬁled an injunction
against the_Occupiers to prove the
illegality of the Occupiers’ continued
residence on the bank’s property.
Their occupation began in mid-
October. ,

Counsel for BNY Mellon and
supporters of the Occupy move-
ment ﬁlled every chair in the small
courtroom. The fashion choices of
the trial’s audience ranged from
suits and ties to" ripped jeans and
T—shirts. V

Most Occupiers seemed conﬁ-
dent in the prospects for a possible
spring—time trial. Occupier Mel Pack-
er, who testiﬁed_on the ﬁrst day of
the hearing, wore a smile almost as
bright as his pink peace-sign button

as he exited the court room.

“We looked good during the en-
tire hearing,” he said’.

Attorneys for BNY Mellon and
Ron Gruendl, spokesman for BNY
Mellon, declined comment following
the hearing. .

Both sides willﬁle ﬁndings of fact

for Ward to reviewbeforeshe makes _

her ruling.

Attorneys for both BNY Mellon
and Occupy Pittsburgh have two
weeks from the time the court re-
leases transcriptions of the hear-
ing to complete and submit their
ﬁndings of fact. The "date of those
transcriptions’ availability is not im-
mediately known.

If Ward decides Occupy Pitts-
burgh is lawful in its habitation of

_ the park, then the case will go to trial.

Either side can appeal the decision, a

' process that would allow the Occupi-

ers to remain at the camp. .
Pittsburgh’s branch of the Occup

Wall Street movement ﬁnds itself in

a unique position. Members of the

‘ movement have claimed that Oc-

cupy Pittsburgh is the only branch of
the larger protest to occupy abank’s

‘ property, and it is also amongthe few

movements that have avoided raids
by police. Occupy camps in New

-- York, Philadelphia, Oakland‘, Calif.,

and other cities across the U.S. have
been raided or evicted by police. . _
Much of ‘the discourse for the

hearing’s second day centered on .

whether the Occupy camp is safe
and whether Mellon Green should
be treated as private property or an
“urban open space.” I

Robert Damewood, a mem-
ber of the movement’s legal
counsel,‘ said “the city’s zoning
code dictates that 10 percent of

Stricker gives State of UHC speech

During the ﬁrst State of the Honors
College address, Honors College
Dean Edward Stricker focused
on looking ahead to the future of
the Honors College, including the

plans for the fall 2012 transforma-
tion of Brackenridge Hall into an
honors dorm.

Stricker, named- dean of the
University Honors College early

_ in July 2011, spoke to about 50

people Wednesday afternoon in
the‘Frick Fine Arts auditorium. The
hour—long address,.which he said

would become an annual event,
chronicled the UHC’s accomplish-
ments and its organizers’ plans to
move forward in expanding the
college. ’

Brackenridge Hall would become a second
honors dorm 4 in addition the UHC dorm-
style living already available in the West
Wing of Sutherland Hall ——— in the fall of
2012. The honors wing of Sutherland cur-
rently houses 408 primarily ﬁrst-year hon-
ors students.  "

A University spokeswoman Patricia White
said in an email that Brackenridge Hall’s
incoming honors students will pay the same
rate for’ the rooms as do current Bracken-
ridge residents, and the dorm will be open
to honors sophomores and juniors. Brack-
enridge, which holds 210 upperclassmen,
was picked because of its central location

and suite—sty1e living, White said.

Located on the 35th and 36th ﬂoors of
the Cathedral,. the Honors College —— es-
tablished in 1986 -— grew out of the earlier

- honors program.

’ classes ‘must have an SAT combined math

Inhis speech, Stricker described how he

. researched numerous universities’ honors

colleges and noticed that they all are mem-
bership organizations, with some honors
colleges acting like smaller schools within
the larger universities. , T l

But Pitt’s UHC is quite different, because
no student is admitted into the UHC and
therefore no student is excluded. Stricker
said the major goal of the Honors College
is to provide the best quality education to .
students on campus. He deﬁned quality as
“the kinds of courses that are intellectually
stimulating that inspire students.”

“The Honors College at the _University
of Pittsburgh‘ is unusual,” Stricker said. “It
has alumni, but no students, and courses,
but no faculty.” T l . 4

Currently, there are about 100 honors
courses at Pitt, Stricker said. The average
honors class size is 18 students.

Any upperclassman can take an honors
class, as long as.he or she either have a 3.25

‘ GPA or get permission from Stricker. Incom-
ing freshmen who want to enroll in honors

and English score of 1400 or a composite
score of 32 on the ACT and must have been

in the top 5 percent of their class in high

school. . . L

Stricker said those rules were in place
before he obtained the position and that he
did not set them.

“These courses are hard, demanding and

a lot of wor ,” Stricker said. ‘-‘It is a hard
adjustment to go from honors high school
classes to’ honors college courses. I don’t

mind the harsh standards so students don’t -

get in over their head.”

The UHC has become a leader in pre- if

health professional advising, what Stricker
labeled as “supplemental advising.” Pre-
health majors include students who want
to go into medical professions, including

medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine.

and optometry, among others:
“Supplemental advising is needed by
students who have majors whose interest
don’t fall exactly into their major, such as
pre-med students,” he said. ‘
Beginning thisspring, the Honors Col-

lege will be supervising the pre-health pro-
fessional committee. juniors can present
their qualiﬁcations —— which include medical
school application materials, transcripts
and a personal essay — to this committee
for evaluation, The committee then writes

a letter of evaluation, which students can

send to medical schools. . V _

» “The University Honors College has
room to support both students interested
in a traditional liberal arts education and a
pre~health professional education,” Stricker
said. , "
Strickerlalso highlighted how UHC co-
sponsored academic events this past year
that were open to all students, such as the
American Experience Lecture Series and

social events like ﬂag football and dances.

“I like his policy, because each individu-
al’s aptitude is different, and college can be a
life-changing experience,” said Dillon Haas,
a senior who has taken honors courses. “It
could be true that someone at ﬁrst may not

be capable of the Honors College‘, but two _

years later may be a fantastic candidate for
taking honors courses.” I

  new chari

By Tiffany Grossi
Staff Writer

After celebrating the completion of its

$500,000 pledge in support of the Univer+

sity of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute this past

December, Pitt’s Greek Life has turned its
V attention to another philanthropy; V.

, The donations raised from this year’s
annual Pitt Dance Marathon, sponsored by
Greek Life',.wil_l go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foun-
dation. The 2012 installment of the event will
be held in the Fitzgerald Field House from
3 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 25, to 3_p.m. Sunday,
Feb. 26'. Sign—ups began Monday at pdm2012.‘
eventbrite.com. A ' ~-

"‘It is sure to be a fantastic event and ben-
eﬁts an outstanding cause,” event organizer
Kyle Miller said. ' I ».

Although Greek Life canceled the 2010 Pitt
Dance Marathon due to snowy conditions,
organizers have high hopes that this year will

' be a success. Last year’s dance marathon was

heldon Bigelow Boulevard in April.

For the all—day event, students can either
choose to be a dancer (a 24-hour participant)
or a moraler (a 12-hour participant).

' _ “The hardest part is having the endur-
ance to stay on your feet for 24 hours,” Miller
said. I j

5 Participants are encouraged to raise a
minimum amount of money to donate to the
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. For Greeks, it
costs $400 to sponsor the ﬁrst two dancers,
$175 for each additional dancer and $100 for

each moraler. Non—Greeks are asked to raise
$100 per dancer and $50 per moraler. The
inclusion of non— Greek organization partici-
pation began last year. ’

“We want to make it easier for students
who are not a part of the Greek community to
participate in Pitt Dance Marathon so that it is
not a Gr_eeks—on1y event but is a campus—wide
fundraising event,” event organizer Shannon
Krohe said.

The Pitt Dance Marathonis organized by an
ei t—person committee, which falls under the
authority of the Greek Week executive board.
Greek Week consists ofyea,r—1ong fundraising
activities organized by leaders from different
sororities and fraternities. In previous years,
Greek Week has supported a number of other
foundations, such as Ronald McDonald House
and Make-A-Wish Foundation.

About 100 student contestants helped
raise $32,000 for the University of Pittsburgh

‘ Cancer Institute last year.

Krohe is optimistic about this year’s mara-
thon’sfundraising outcome. “We have high
hopes that this year’s Pitt Dance Marathon will
be extremely successful in raising awareness
and support for a wonderful cause,” Krohe
said. E l ‘

be set aside as an area open to the public.
Occupy argues that this 10 percent would
include all of the land on which they ca'mp.
BNY Mellon counters that 10 percent of the

regulated property only consists of a small V

portion of Mellon Green, primarily a set of
steps, and-that the remainder of the park is
_ private property.

Paul O’Hanlon, an Occupy supporter and
co-chair of the City-County Task Force on Dis-
abilities, testiﬁed that the camp site is anurban
open space and that the steps portion that BNY

’ Mellon considers an urban open space  not

handicap—accessible

The serious issues addressed in the hear-
ing were interspersed with moments of comic
relief. At one point, after announcing that the
prosecution would rest in its cross—examina-
tion of Occupier Don Carpenter, Dan Booker,
the attorney, representing BNY Mellon, re-
tracted his statement armouncing he had one
more question.

'“Because I can’t resist,” Bookersaid. “Can
you tell me what an ‘occucuddle puddle"
is?” The query referred to a tweet Carpenter
had sent: out from the camp one night.

The courtroom burst into laughter and

Carpenter proceeded to inform the court that
an occucuddle puddle is a nighttime gathering
of Occupiers in a single tent to chat and spend

time together.

Booker said his daughter used to partici:
pate in those, but she had called them pajama
parties. ‘

According to Pitt alumnus Stephen Fuegi,
the attorney representing Occupy Pittsburgh,
members of BNY Mel1on’s legal team did not
prove the criteria necessary for eviction of
the Occupy camp. Fuegi said these criteria
included proving the camp created dangerous
conditions on the land or a detriment to the
public good. ,

“I don’t think they were able to show
irreparable harm. We feel they have not met

I

. that burden. The court likely will not grant

preliminary injunction, and then it will be
set for trial.”

years on the Internet —— Google

and pervasive fashion.

All this seems to reinforce the
idea that humans are becoming ob- '

MOVIE REVIEW

By Natalie Bell
Magazine Editor

“The Devil Inside”

Directed by William Brent Bell
Starring: Fernanda Andrade,
Simon Quarterman

Grade: F

The horror—movie genre is one that’s
often unfairly known for its low stan-
dards. This is because movies with
ample advertising like “The Devil

Inside” plague movie—goers, while _

truly creative and innovative hor-
ror ﬁlms garner smaller measures
of success. " ,

If we’re to take the principles of
song mash-ups and apply them to
movies, “The Devil Inside” is “The
Blair Witch Project,” “The Exorcism
of Emily Rose” and “The Divine Se-

; crets of the Ya—Ya Sisterhood” com-

bined into one ﬁlm. Hear me out on
this. With the shaky, ﬁlmed—it—myself
camera shots of “Blair Witch,” the ex-
orcism conventions of “E1nily Rose”
and the “searching my mother’s past”
component of “Ya-Ya,” this movie
sparkles with mediocrity. "

It’s not that the movie is, in it-
self, some kind of awﬁil monstrosity.
Rather, it’s tired. It’s taking overused,
cliched ideas and packaging them
together, hoping we won’t feel like
we’ve seen it all before. Perhaps in
the age of the Internet we’ve become
jaded by the sheer number of ﬁlms
out there, but worse than laughably
awful, this ﬁlm is almost totally for-
gettable. ‘ _

The movie kicks off with Isabella
Rossi (Fernanda Andrade), who,
after years of growing up in a mys-

WPTS COLUMN

tery-shrouded and motherless atmo-

sphere, has decided to investigate her
mother’s odd crime — murdering
three people — and its even stranger
religious connections — the killings
took place during an exorcism. She
decides to make a documentary and
go to Italy to learn about exorcisms,
the Catholic Church and what can be
done for her mother who currently
resides, heavily medicated, in a psy-
chiatric ward. I
Travelingwith Isabella is the cyni-
cal and barely tolerable Michael (Io-

_ nut Grama), her cinematographer.

There’s absolutely no background
discussed on how these two got
together, and even less insight into
what their current relationship is.
Over the course of the ﬁlm, it remains
unclear whether they’re friends or

Something that music lovers

 ;--r,-' .5. o s._‘,.,;,.. -.».-~..-._.~ .

and another begins is crafting their
very own year-end list of favorite
music. '

While popular blogs like Pitch-

widespread interest for their own
year-end lists, chances are that your
own list might not be held to the
same high standard or, thankfully,
the same scrutiny.

.just two strangers stuck together.
After a particularly difﬁcult inter-
action with ‘her terrifying mother,
as Isabella cries in obvious distress,
Michael excitedly tells Isabella they
got some great shots —'he’s either
completely oblivious or an incred-
ible jerk. ‘
Fortunately, clergymen Ben (Si-
mon Quarterman) and David (Evan
Helmuth) are mega—priesty badasses
who perform unsanctioned exor-
cisms on the side. They take_Isabella
‘on one of their missions before de-
ciding to tackle what is apparently
the biggest, baddest demon takeover
of all time .——~ Isabella’s mother.
They somehow convinceher psy-
chiatric ward to let them run some
tests and then proceed to try to ex-
orcise this dernon. No one’s sure if

Why, then, would anyone take the “
time to compile awritten document
to archive and display his own views
of music’s best of the best — or, for
that matter, worst of the worst? The

' answer is simple and lies in music’s

nostalgic properties, which allow,
lovers to" document their lives with
what’s relevant or buzz-worthy.

- The year-end list —— and, indeed,

Courtesy Paramount Pictures

they’re ever successful or not, but
Isabella’s mother’s vital signs drop
back to normal, and she seems con-
siderably improved. Afterward, as
they listen to the tapes of the exor-
cism, Ben claims he hears four voices,
meaning multiple demonic posses-

‘ sions. But, wait, aren’t their four main

characters? How convenient.

Part of the problem from the
get—go is that we never get a feel for
Isabella: What was her life like after
her mother went to jail? What kind

of person is she? What ﬁnancial --

situation allows her to completely
neglect her previous life and run off-
to Italy? This total lack of character
development plagues the entire ﬁlm.
Everyone is such a sketch of a person
that the audience feels completely
ambivalent toward their mission and

all painstakingly constructed music
lists — serves as a way not only to
document your musical taste, but
also your development over the past
365 days. The lists serve as a testa-
ment to the number of hours you’ve
spent alone pouring over the _vast
reaches of the Internet searching
for the next best records.

Had a great year‘? Remember it

 

a ’The Devil Inside’ should ei our of theaters

fates. Whatever happens, happens.
After all, none of these people are
likable or even hateable enough for
viewers to hope for any particular
outcome.

With so little to go on, the only
things the audience seems to react
to are the surprising jumpy moments
—,; of which there are plenty. But even
these come fromvery contrived situ-
ations. Look, we get it — in horror
movies the victim always runs up-
stairs. Do we really need to perform
exorcisms of evil, violentgdemons in
rooms with walls ﬁill of potential or
actual weapons? The protagonists
always seem to be trying to save oth-
ers’ souls in basements with tools on
the walls, employing only delicate
fabric ties on the possessees’ wrists
and ankles. ‘

Worse yet, nearly every scene
is nauseating thanks to the home-
camera shaky-hands problem. Un-
like “Paranormal Activity,” which
managedto skirt around this issue
by using mounted home cameras,
this movie almost exclusively uses
unstably ﬁlmed footage.

And yet another snag in an al-

Z ready bumpy cinematic ride: The

dialogue is totally unbelievable.
Whereas the “you complete me”s of
romantic comedies aren’t realistic ei-
ther, they’re something most people
desire to hear. The lines in this movie,
while trying to mimic reality, are ﬂat
and totally uninteresting —— at times
even inappropriate, as demonstrated
in Michael’s previously mentioned
inappropriate excitement.

Overall, this ﬁlm is not very good
— but worse, it’s pretty much for-
gettable. H -

RESTAURANT REVIEW

Byjulie Allerton & NatalieeBell
Magazine Staff .,

For ‘students on a budget, the new restaurant
arrives on Forbes with an affordable selection
for any eater.

Located just down the street from Litchﬁeld
Towers, Noodles is abright and welcoming spot
for hungry college students to enjoy just about
any type of pasta at an awesome price.

Based on the idea that most people will ap-
preciate a nice, big bowl of carbohydrates -
particularly when they’re allowed to choose
between three international cuisine styles -
it’s hard to see how the establishment couldn’t
be wonderful. Choose from Asian, Mediterra-
nean and American and you cango on aworldly

Grade: A * A '

The moniker “entertainer” truly ﬁts the rap-

‘ per Common.

The once—raw rapper has produced album

i ' after album, appeared,in‘multiple ﬁlms and

even dabbled inja form of rap more akin to
spoken word poetryfthan. hip—hop. Since the
1998 track’ “I Used to Love H.E.R.” in_which
Common lamented theistate’ of hip—hop, he’s
experimented with many paths, each of which
has been reﬂected in his music. Now it seems
like the multi-talented Chicagoan —— aside from

appearinginAMC’s“HellonWheels”—is once , .

again focused onbeing a rapper.

Formerly known as Common Sense, Chica-
go’s South Side emcee starts off his new album
with a track titled, “The Dreamer.” Produced

‘ by fellow Chicagoan No I'.D., the album features

Common laying down meaningful lyrics over
No I.D.’s characteristic blend of samples and
electronic sounds and the typical snare and
hi-hat which deﬁne the genre. Although Com-
mon’s lyrical talent shines through, the spot-
light belongs to featuredartist Maya Angelou,
who ends “The Dreamer” with a poem that
urges the listener to “dare to dream.”

Calling on another poet, Common also en-
lists the help of New York City emcee Nas in his‘
second song, “Ghetto Dreams.” It seems as if
the poet inside Common is battling the Com-

mon of his earlier days on the music scene as '

the performer lays down raw lyrics while still
conveying an uplifting message of positivity
and belief in dreams.

Panthers’ longest losing streak

under Coach Dixon.

Before this season, Dixon had
never lost four games in a row.‘
But with the 62-39 loss to Rutgers

. (10—7, 2-2 Big East) at the Petersen

Events Center, they-Panthers (11-6,
0-4 Big East) extended their los-
ing skid and remained winless in
the Big East.‘

The 39-point ﬁnal tally in the

_ Panthers’ fourth home loss of the

season marked the lowest number
of points Pitt men’s basketball (11-
6, O—4 Big East) has scored in the
Dixon era. It was also the fewest
points scored by Pitt since De-
cember 1973 and the fewest by

Miller said
he could tell
before‘ the
game that
his team was
in the right
frame of
mind to earn
the win.

“We could
kind of tell

during warm—ups thatwe were

locked in and really focused to win
the game,” Miller said. “[During]

the ﬁrst four minutes of the game, «

we saw that we were out-hustling
them the whole time.”

1 The Panthers made only four
ﬁeld goals in _the ﬁrst-half, shoot-
ing 12.5 percent from the ﬂoor
and 18.2 percent from beyond the
arc. With the game tied 14-14 with

8:12 remaining in the ﬁrst half,
the Scarlet Knights went on a 16-5
run to build a 30-19 lead before
thelbreak.

They never looked back, and it
appeared like Pitt stopped trying
to catch them.

“We just got to want it more,”
Pitt senior Ashton Gibbs said.
“Me and Nas [Nasir Robinson]

as leaders, we got to step up and .

let everybody follow our lead  It
starts with us, and we just have to
keep it going from here.”

It didn’t get much better in the
second half as Rutgers started on a
17-7 run to extend its lead to 47-26'
with 9:44 remaining. ' "

Pitt shot 21 percent during

the game and made just 12 total‘

ﬁeld goals, struggling even with
layups. - ‘
‘‘We’ve been emphasizing that
in practice, making layups and
stuff,” sophomore].J. Moore said.
“We getdown on ourselves and we
start taking it out on each other
and that’s one thing that we have

to stop doing.” _

Since losing starting point
guard Travon Woodall to an ab-
dominal tear and groin strain, ‘the
Panthers’ offense has been stag-
nant. Dixon said Woodall has been

' shooting and warming up, but. is

not near being up to competing
in a game.

_ The defensive problems that .
have plagued Pitt this season don’t

seem to be going away, either. The
Scarlet Knights were able to con-
sistently drive past the Panther
guards and into the lane.

In contrast, even when the
Panthers could penetrate the Rut-
gers offense, they often turned
the ball over. The Scarlet Knights
scored 17 points off 15 Panther
mistakes. ’ .

“They just played good defense
as well,”Gibbs said. “Their guards
played really good defense. The
times'We did get in the paint, usd-

' ally we got deﬂected passes and

turnovers.”

Gibbs said former Pitt assis-
tant Mike Rice knew several of
the Panthers’ offensive plays. Rice
agreed. 1

i “We run half of what they run,
to be honest with you,” Rice said.
“They are good plays, they are
good sets. Our switching defenses
doesn’t allow Ashton to getlopen
and get looks.”

_By Donnie Tasser_
Staff Writer

As the latest college football sea-
son shrinks away in the rearview
mirror, we can reﬂect on an unfor-
gettable year of forgettable college
football with -- you guessed it — a
top—10 listof  well I don’t know
what tocall it, so here goes.

10. The meaning of the phrase
“high octane” will forever be ironic
in the minds of all Pittsburgh_Pan-
ther football fans.

9. Andrew Luck is apparently ’

Christ in cleats. All blasphemy
aside, the ‘Stanford quarterback
was treated with such reverence by
draft experts that if the guy doesn’t
walk on water soon, Mel Kiperjr.
and Todd McShay will be running
out of categories in which they can
rate him a “perfect 10.”

8. The Big 10, now with 12 mem-
bers, should not be confused with
the Big 12, now with 10 members.
Whatever happened to logic in this
country? _ T

7. Props to the little guys. Chan-
neling their inner Drew Brees, lilli-
putian quarterbacks Case Keenum
of Houston and Kellen Moore of
Boise State — measuring 6’2”
and 6’O”, respectively (the aver-
age height of N FL,quarterbacks is
6’4”) ended their careers in pos-
session of NCAA quarterbacking
records. Keenum broke the NCAA

A

MCT Campus

 

record for touchdown passes, total
touchdowns, yards and comple-
tions, and Moore became the ﬁrst
quarterback in FBS history to win
50 career games.

6. The commercialism of col-
lege sports was the most inter-

esting part of that snoozefest we 5

called a BCS National Champion-
ship Game between LSU and Ala-
bama. Next year, instead of a subtle
decal the size of a bowling ball,
maybe they can insert an actual
Dr Pepper can inside the crystal
football. And then the Allstate guy
can perform at halftime.

5. RG3 4 H31SM4N. ’

4. Withthe addition of Hous-

ton, Central Florida, Southern

Methodist, Boise State and San
Diego State, the loss of Pittsburgh,
Syracuse and West Virginia and
the ﬂip-ﬂopping of TCU, the Big
East will henceforth be renamed
the,“Temporary-Stay Conference.”
This is not a true fact.

3. They now have security
guards stationed inside the locker
rooms at Penn State University.
This is a true fact.

2. Evidently body ink is a legiti-
mate form of currency in Colum-
bus. Also, the sanctity of sweater

3 vests in the state of Ohio has been

revoked. ,
1. The winner of LSU-Alabarria
Round 3 (if any of us could‘actu—
ally sit through another one) will
decide who is the National Cham-
pion, right? Oh. Nevermind  3

The return Of th

By Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

After a lockout that lasted 161 days, the NBA
ii back in ﬁill swing.

Despite the lockout, the league has the
potential to have one ofits strongest seasons
yet with a spread of talent that fans haven’t
seen since the mid—’8os when players like
Larry Bird, Michaeljordan and Magicjohnson
were the faces of what many consider the

NBA’s “Golden Age.” -

Presently, the association is onlthe thresh-
old of another Golden Age. A common argu-
ment against the league’s popularity.—— and
an issue debated over and over again in talks
between owners and representatives of the
Players Association during the lockout — is
that too many teams do not have the chance
to compete with teams possessing more ﬁ-
nancial resources. As a result, according to

some owners, talent is concentrated in too

few places.

That argument could not be ﬁirther from‘
the .truth. , . I

We are all aware of the Big Threes that exist '
in today’s game: Dwyane Wade, LeBron]ames
and Chris Boshpf the Heat; Kobe Bryant, Pau
Gasol and Andrew Bynum of the Lakers; and
(what people now refer to as the Big Four) ,
Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and
Ray Allen of the Celtics. However-;what makes
the NBA’s current era special is that —— despite

the standings not reﬂecting success for some
teams — nearly every team has a player that
is recognizable, which is more than sports
associations likethe NHL and MLB can say.

Some’ of these most recognizable faces
come from two of the league’s worst teams:
Kyrie Irving and John Wall of the Cleveland
Cavaliers and Washington Wizards, respec-
tively. - . .

Currently, NBA owners are shiftingfocus
from the paint and opting for a cornerstone
power forward or center to place a premium
on young, talented point guards. As a result,

, three of the previous four No. 1 overall picks

in the NBA’s draft were point guards, with
Irving drafted last year at No. 1 and Wall the
year before.

The most notable member of all these picks
is Derrick Rose, the No. 1 overall pick of the

Chicago Bulls in 2008, who was tabbed as the I

NBA’s Most Valuable Player of the 2010-2011
campaign. At 23 years old, Rose became the
youngest player in the league’s richhistory
‘to win the honor. a '

Furtherevidence of the league’s parity
made itself obvious in the most recent NBA
playoffs. For just the fourth time since the
NBA playoff format-expanded to include 16
teams in 1984, a team seeded eighth upset
a team with the top seed in a bracket. The
Memphis Grizzlies -——_ missing arguably their
best player, small forward Rudy Gay-—— upset

the Western Conference’s top-seeded team,_

the San Antonio Spurs, in six games.

In the Eastern Conference, the Indiana
Pacers did nearly the same thing against the
top seed, the Chicago Bulls. Although Chicago
won the series four games to one, the ﬁnal
tally deceives fans. In every game Indiana lost,

. the Pacers held a lead in the fourth quarter

against the Bulls, and‘ very well could have
won the series. - . ~

That beingsaid, fans should expect parity.
to carry over to this season and make itself
clearer. H

A number of teams I expect to contend
might surprise many fans across the nation.
Despite being a supporter of the Lakers thanks
to my time spent in Southern California, I also
have been intrigued by the Minnesota Timber-
wolves. Although their president of basketball
operations, David Kahn, has a terrible reputa-
tion after making some of the worst transac-

~ tions in recent memory, Minnesota has been

traveling a path that many teams take in order
to get out of the cellar. The Timberwolves have
ayoung core of talent consisting of Kevin Love,
Michael Beasley, recent No. 2 overall draft pick
Derrick Williams and Ricky Rubio. The group
has astronomical potential.

Rubio possesses the capability to be one

of the next great point guards in the league, ‘

and his passing ability has drawn comparisons‘

to that of one of the all-time great players in '

basketball history, “Pistol” Pete Maravich.

NBA» l3

January 12, 2012 I The Pitt News I WwW.pittneWs.com

NBA- 

FROMPAGEI2 p - U .

_Much controversy_existed over Rubio, as he
was drafted by the Timberwolves with the No.
7 pick in the 2009 NBA Draft, directly after
another point guard, Jonny Flynn, the N o. 6'

__ overall pick by Minnesota.

Another team that I expect to rise from me-
diocrity — or worse — this season is, believe
it or not, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Although the
Cavs_won only 19 games last season, Cleveland
fans should be hopeful. With the drafting of
Irvinggas well as No. ‘4 overall pick Tristan
Thompson, the Cavaliers have an outside shot
at grabbing a seven or eight seed in the post-
season in an Eastern Conference that appears
-to have only four locks for playoff spots.

. _ Currently, the Cavs are 4-5. But as fans have ~ 
seen many times before, you don’t necessarily

need a winning record to make the playoffs
in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland has a
veteran scorer in forward Antawn Jamison
and solid defenders in guard Anthony Parker
and center Anderson Varejao. In the event
Irving and Thompson make strides in this
shortened season, Cleveland could be a team
to look out for. ’
For this upcoming week, here are some
games to check out on national television:
Fridayjan. 13 — Chicago Bulls at the Bos-
ton Celtics 6
This game offers two facets of basketball
that currently make it great. For one, both
teams are among the most successful at de-
fending the basket and playing physical, so if
you like defense and rebounding, you’re in for

-treat. Second, this game features a matchup

of arguably the league’s two best point guards:
Rondo vs. Rose. For any basketball fan, watch-
ing these two marshal their troops on the hard-

,‘ wood is an experience.

Mondayjan. 16 —— Dallas Mavericks at the
Los Angeles Lakers '

For the ﬁrst time since the Mavs embar—
rassed the Lakers with a sweep in last year’s
Western Conference semiﬁnals, these two
teams will meet. The dynamic here should
intrigue fans, as many expected the Lakers to
look old and slow and the Mavs to be serious
contenders to repeat. However, the opposite is
the case here, as the Mavs have yet to come to-
gether as ateam, and age is certainlyaffecting

’ their play early in the schedule. Los Angeles, on

the other hand, has looked far from old, with
Kobe Bryant posting 48 points against Phoenix
Tuesday night, the league high so far and a
record for most points scored in a game by a
player in his 16*“ season or later in the league’s
history. You can also keep an eye on Lamar
Odom, who played for the Lakers last season

and is now decked out. in Mavericks blue. I . ‘
