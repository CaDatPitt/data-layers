bowl game — another ﬁrst in the

Pitt junior receiver Oderick
Turner, who caught a touchdown
pass from Bill Stull in the sec-
ond quarter, said he and his team

couldn’t be more "excited about‘

the success they’ve had this sea-
son, and is looking forward to his
ﬁrstbowl appearance.

“It’s such a weight off our

so close. But more importantly,

Pitt [7-2, 3-1 Big East] took
a steptoward that title on Satur-

sion two weeks ago in ‘a loss to
Rutgers and didn’t play last week
against Notre Dame, returned to
lead the offense. He finished the
game 15-of-27 with 216 yards, a
touchdown and no interceptions.

For many students, games like
red rover and tag were left on the
playground a long time ago. But
for members of Pitt’s 4-Square
Club this is far from the truth.

“Just come to play for 10 min-
utes,” said Phil Thomas, the club’s
president,'while trying to encour-
age potential new members to
join in last Monday’s meeting by
offering them free Little Hug juice

drinks. The club has no member- _

Thomas said the first proposi-
tion for the club started in 2004
when Justin’ Keogh, who was
a Pitt student at the time, got a
strange idea. After four hours of
work one day, he created a-consti-
tution for the 4-Square Club and
urged his friends to be the first
members. ,

“Things have just escalated
since then,” said Thomas. The
group now has 200 active mem-

bers.

$43 million go to campus construction

by Michael Ploetgz
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Property and Facilities Com-
mittee recently approved a long list of
construction projects around campus,

which altogether will cost millions of I

dollars

At its meeting last Friday, the Com-
mittee, a portion of ‘Pitt’s Board of
Trustees, approved construction and
renovation projects for University-
owned buildings and four leases that
collectively will cost $43,151,300.

The largest of these projects in-
cluded the purchase of roughly 12.5
acres of land located on Robinson and
Carrillo streets, near Trees Hall The
plot of vacant land, formerly known
as Robinson Court, will be the site of
a sports complexthat will house facili-
ties for baseball, softball, soccer; track
and intramurals

The committee also approved a
total of $9,085,000 to be used toward
improving Amos Hall. The dorm usu-
ally houses about 135 female students
in nine different sororities Changes to
be made include the installation of a

~ new heating system, renovated bath-

rooms and improvements to building ‘

security.

In addition, the University will up-
grade portions of the Van de Graaff
Building, which is connected to Old
 Hall To accommodate a

_ growingnanoscienceinitiativehere, the

University will convert approximately

1,900 square feet of former physics V

laboratories to better suit the needs of
the nanoscience department

The committee plans to use $3,955‘
to install an emergency generator in
midcampus The 1,000-kilowatt diesel
generator will provide backup power
for the Van de Graaff Building, Space
Research Coordination ‘Center, Old
 I.-Iall, Thaw Hall and Al-
len Hall. ’

The committee said in a news
release that it views the generator as

a necessary expense because many .

buildings in rnidcampus house critical
research projects. I . '

The research is classiﬁed much in
the same way as life support systems at
a hospital

A signiﬁcant amount of the $43
million budget will also go toward four

leases .

The largest of these leases is _for
20,965 square feet of space at 128 N.
Craig St, which the Universityfs Of-
{ice of Institutional Advancement will
use The ofﬁce’s_ purpose is to 
philanthropy and foster relationships
with those who might become ﬁiture.
philanthropists to Pitt.

The committee approved a 10-

- year lease, with an  annual cost

of $418,132 that will allow the depart-
ment of rehabilitation science and
technology to have space in the Bakery
Square development at Penn Avenue
The committee also approved

. leases for the Clinical and Translational

Science Institute and the Physical‘Ac-
tivity and. W/eight Management Re-
search Center. According to the com-
mittee, both of these programs have
outgrown their current facilities

John Pelusi, chairman of the com-
mittee, said these projects received
 not only from the University,
but from the state of Pennsylvania
and the city of Pittsburgh, as well

“It’s a win-win situatiorl,” said Pe-
lusi; “[lt’s] another way that the Uni-
versity is helping with the overall com-
munity.” I 1

‘Justin rule'and idea for ring of ﬁre spice up 4-Square

4-Square, page 1

Meetings primarily take place
on Posvar, Hall’s patio, but the
game can be played on anyflat

‘surface where four squares can

be formed, according to the
4-Square rulebook. The squares
are numbered one through four,

and the "game begins with a pass

from the player_ in. the fourth
square, often referred to as the
king, to the player occupying the
second. .

Though four players can only
be in action atone time, once one
player goes out, another player
takes the open spot inside of
square one. Many games occur
simultaneously during the course

of one singlemeeting so everyone '

can participate, said Thomas.
“The server can make up any
rule they want at the beginning
of a game,” said Thomas. “If.
the serversays ‘anything goes,’ it
means just that. Some meetings
we spend all night trying to hit
the patio ceiling.”
No one’s been able to do that.
yet this semester, said Thomas.
The club members all have
unique rules.to bring to the game
when it’s their turn to serve the
ball. Pitt student Jason Bennett
favors the “Justin Rule.”

“You stretch out your domi-
nant arm in front of you and
then wrap your non-dominan_t
arm underneath to bring your
non—dominant hand up over your
face,” said Bennett.AThe mask-
like technique impairs the player’s
vision and disables the move-
ment of both arms, makingit
difficult to hit the ball, let alone
see it coming. . '

I Bennett said the group al-
ways has a first-‘aid kit available at

meetings in case a technique goes .

wrong.

But he said he doesn’t think
anyone’s ever had to use it. He
added that other medical‘ re-
sources are in close proximity if
anyone got seriously injured.

Bennett holds the titleiof club
ofﬁcer and the important duty
of keeping the Little Hug juice
drinks safe throughout the year.

“At the beginning of the fall
semester I have about 4,180 Hugs
in my basement,” said Bennett,
who one day turned the large
amount of Hugs into a life-sized
fort that still stands today.

The club has an agreement
with the 'company' to get free

' little Hugs, which are distributed
during regular meetings.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

The group takes part in tourna-
ments and other events through-
out the_year. It ‘receives funding
from a mini—grant that allows it to
have an alcohol—free event inside
of the _Schenley Quad, and it col-
laborates with St. Jude’s Church
to puton a‘ 4—Square tournament
for charity.

 club has not only grown
in members, but also it has an
ongoing Vision List, according
to Thomas. The list includes pos-

sible events or even idealslforthe '

game.

Some items have been on the
list since the first year. A

Flaming 4—Square, which in-
volves playing 4—Square in an
environment made of ﬁre, is just
one of the ideasgthat makes the
list. '

“This is a guaranteed thing
that we would need waivers for,”
said Thomas. “I am not sure that
I feel totally comfortable about
that.”

Regular meetings take place
Monday nights from 7,_\to 9:30
p.m, weather permitting.

If the group gets enough sup-

port, it will have meetings during"

the winter inside of the Fitzger-

.ald Field House.

“Accounting has had, and will

ing about changing career paths
as a result of the crisis. ‘

“Students are going to have to readjust
their expectations,” said Matychak. “Stu-
dents planning on going to Wall Street
should probably consider taking a govern-
ment job' for a couple of years, or getting a
job from a company that’s not in the news.
It may not be exactly the money or the ex-
perience that they were looking for, but at
the very.least they can be great stepping
stones to a bigger, better career later on.”

Lehn agreed and "said students should
pursue less commercial ﬁrms on \Wall
Street and around the country.

“Th_e best advice I can give is to go af-

' ter jobs at second—tier banks and ﬁrms,” he -

said. “These places like Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey and even PNC are all poised to
take the place of the former huge banks
and ﬁrms like Lehman Brothers. Go for
places that are under the radar.”

Both professors and students said they
were optimistic about the economy over
the long run and were anxious to see what
changes would come about over the next
few years. _

“The major risk we all have is that pol-
icy-makers may create policies that would
worsen the situation justto make it look
like they were doing something,” said
Lehn. ‘TI hope  the election and every-
thing, politicians will make good; positive
changes that will Help rather than hurt.” ‘

Infrastructure spending 

is the best stimulus plan

President-elect Barack
Obama has pledged to bring
change to Washington, but he
might end up emulating Franklin
Roosevelt in his plan for how to
bring the economy out of reces-
sion.

The idea of public works
projects brings to mind images

« of workers from the 109305 toil-

ing to build dams, bridges and
other infrastructure in order to
provide jobs and counteract the
Great Depression. But Obama
supports infrastructure spe_nding
and could make it a central part

‘ of a stimulus package Demo-
M crats are expected to bring be-

fore Congress later this month.
Many experts ridicule infra-

:structure spending for being

too slow and time-consuming
to counteract the effects of an

economic crisis, and they argue

j instead for stimulus checks and

bailout packages that give money
out as it’s needed.
They also criticize the slow

' turnaround on public works
3 spending, citing the fact that
‘ large public projects take years
 of planning and development—
1 time when nobody beneﬁts from
- the project.

Some also worry that these

; projects could lead to an increase

j in pork-barrel spending, wasting

Obama could be onto some-

 thing with this plan, though. De-

spite criticism, infrastructure and

4 public works spending could be
 key to pulling the United States
. out of the current recession, es-
, pecially now that it looks like it
 could go on for far longer than
1 many estimates predicted.‘

Public works projects are

t ages. Building a bridge takes

thus it takes longer for the econ-

these projects. Instead of an ex- 
tra stimulus check, these projects 
simply provide the same wages 
any other job would, which nec- 
essarily reduces how fast people 
will spend it.

But what’s different about

infrastructure spending is the
added beneﬁt it provides outside ‘
of econornic_ stimulus. It helps
people directly in the form of
repairs or public beneﬁts, like Q
by providing repairs to public l
schools and ofﬁce buildings or 
performing necessary upkeep E
for crumbling bridges and water
systems. A

Public works projects can
provide beneﬁcial urban renewal
and more efﬁcient infrastruc- 
ture systems, and the beneﬁts of 
these projects endure for years 
longer than the quick ﬁx of
stimulus checks. Even after the
work is done, the project itself
still remains and gives a tangible
beneﬁt to anyone who uses it.

For instance, Pittsburgh’s
“Three Sisters” bridges — the
Roberto Clemente, Andy War-
hol and Rachel Carson bridges
—— were built between 1924 and i
1928 by the Allegheny County ;
Department of Public Works ‘
and are still a crucial part of
transportation in. the city today.

Residents of Allegheny
County recognized the beneﬁts
of public works spending last
Tuesday, as they voted in favor
of a referendum allowing the
state to incur $400,000 of extra
debt for the construction and
upkeep of water and sewer sys-
terns.

These projects create more
long-term beneﬁts than stimulus

checks and also provide needed V

jobs.

They are. simply a more at-
tracdve and socially conscious ’
way to improve the economy
and the well-being of American
citizens. Hopefully Congress 
sees it the same way. i

Student orgs aren't all Worth funds

by Lewis Lehe
Columnidt

    
 

You will "sometimes hear
about controversies over Student
Government Board’s allocations

choices. It’s a hard row to hoe,
doling out cash to folks who all
offer intriguing uses for those

dollars. Because of time and in- 0

formation constraints on our of-
ﬁcers, they can’t always make the
best choices. And so I hold my
tongue on most issues, but on two
matters I cannot.

First, Habitat Against Human-
ity is a complete waste of money.
“But why?” you ask?

For one, Habitat Against Hu-
manity burns down poor people’s
houses all the time. It rejoices in
carnage and discomfort. Mem-
bers of the group put a torch and
battering ram to anything that
approaches adequate shelter, and
they take more pride and pleasure
in their work than most professors
do. Here is the Habitat Against
Humanity mission statement:

“Habitat Against Humanity is
heinously dedicated to razing af-
fordable housing freaking all the
way to the ground, giving Jimmy

Carter nightmares and -— as a
tertiary objective —— telling little
kids that the school they go to is
secretly a ‘special’ school and no
one is supposed to let them know
about it.”

For my activities fee to spon-
sor the organization’s brilliantly
executed midnight swarm attacks
on innocent households is absurd.
I won’t stand for it! And I espe-
cially won’t pay for it. These peo-
ple should be stopped, _and they
especially should be unfunded!

Likewise, it is hard to walk
more than a block without hear-

ing that we should send peace-
keepers to another backwater
nation where the supply of toler-
ance falls far behind a bottomless
demand for machete sharpeners.

Most of the students play-~

ing Paul Revere to these massa-
cres are good kids with a ﬁre in

their souls. Maybe you disagree
with them. Maybe you say, “Our
troops must be conserved. iHere
we ﬁnd ourselves overextended in
all corners. And now is not that
time.” But you must respect these
electriﬁed minions of the pure-at-
heart.

The same cannot be said of
STANDM, a group united by un-
ﬂinching comrnitrnent to waste
billions deploying UN Peacekeep-
ers to Darfur, Minn. Members
of Students Taking Action Now,
Darfur, Minnesota, are nothing
but idle int_erlopers who have
shouldered a cause of absolutely
no ‘merit. Their allegations of
genocide are baseless. The tiny
village of Darfur, Minn., is little
more than a church, a lounge and

a bank by a railroad crossing.

Here is STANDM’s mission,

statement: “Students Taking Ac-
tion Now, Darfur, Minnesota,
aims to tie up at least 40,000 sol-
diers from an expensive and highly
trained international coalition by
sending them to puddle around,
 their little. thumbsies
in Darfur, Minn. We think there
might be a genocide there.”

Shamowl shows some shifting salesman styles

by Josh Green

Colum/ziot

  
 

ladies and gentlemen, 
have changed. Our country has ﬁ-
nally made the transition that many
of us have been waiting for since the
beginning of this new millennium.
We have chosen a man who sets a
new tone in America, far from the
loud, confrontational voice we have
been used to for a decade. This is the

beginning of something new and ex-
cidng.

That’s right, ladies and gentle-
men. I am  of course, about
the rise of the ShamWow! guy.

But how much do we ieally know
about the ShamWow! guy?

Vince Offer is his name. Long-
time viewers of Comedy Central at
3 in the morning might know Vince
from his movie, “Underground
Comedy Movie.” It’s the late—night
commercial that wasn’t “Girls Gone
Wil .” But he has moved on from
comedy to the difﬁcult art of being a
television salesman.

His style is unique, something

that infomercial viewers have not
seen before. He appears with a head-
set microphone, clearly visible, as if
he were  in for Garth Brooks.
He directly addresses the presence
of the cameraman, saying “Ya fol-
lowing me, camera guy?” Camera
guy, probably a rnild-rnannered per-
son named doesn’t even have
the dignity of being called by his
name. 4 V

This style exempliﬁes the future
of television salesmanship. Vince
Offer is new and fresh. His prod-
uct is good, and he knows it What
reason does he have to prove it?
His commercials seem as though
he remembered that he was 
an advertisement in 10 minutes, he

‘ showed up at the set, and a minute
later he had his paycheck.

Offer has nothing to prove to
the customer. He is not interested
in impressing us with his sale. Seth
Stevenson from Slate said of Offer,
“He makes us feel like idiots for even
entertaining the notion of not buy-
ing a ShamWow!.” Stevenson asserts
that Offer is the future of television
salesmanship.

’ But if Offer is the future, then
. who is the past? That would be Billy
Mays, the black-bearded, blue—collar
everyman who yelled his way to
infomercial stardom through Oxi-
Clean and OrangeGlo. When Mays
ﬁrst entered the scene, people were
immediately drawn in by his energy
and enthusiasm. He really wanted
viewers to have his product, and he
would yell as loud as he could for
them to understand.

Mays assumes a rapport with the
audience “Billy Mays here,” he says.
“You know me. I’ve never let you
down before. I just want to make
your life easier.”

Now there’s the new kid in town.
If Offer’s style takes root, then it
is possible that Billy Mays will fade
into obscurity. After all, Mays tries to
convince viewers to buy the prod-
uct Vince Offer doesn’t even care.
People will soon wonder why Mays
is so desperate.

Offer’s inﬂuence is already evi-
dent

In his newest advertisement,
Mays is selling a product called

Mighty Mendit, a ﬂexible bonding

agent used to repair torn clothing.
He goes through a series of sce-i
narios in order to prove the legiti-
macy of the product I got a sense
of Mays’ desperation when he said
these words: “We even repaired this
parachute with Mighty Mendit” The
next shot is Billy Mays in an airplane
with a skydiver who leaps from
13,000 feet

Has Billy Mays jumped the
shark?

How does a man know when
the end of his inﬂuence is near? It
becomes clear when he must throw
a human  from an airplane to
prove he still has worth.

Vince Offer wouldn’t even drive
to an airport

It is clear that America is at a
crossroads. What do we want for the
next decade of our lives? High—deci—
bel delivery and extreme demonstra-
tions or half—hearted condescension?
Do Americans want a new path?
How many of us are afraid of Of-
fer, a man we just met? Has he been
properly vetted to take over the role
of main television salesman?

At a Halloween party this year I

saw someone dressed as the Sham-
Wow! guy. But there was not a single
Billy Mays in sight Younger custom-
eis will certainly identify with Offer.
But what of the older customer?
Wilich way will this demographic
sway?

The bearded community has
resoundingiy voiced its support for
Mays, unsurprisingly.

I was undecided on this issue.
That was until I saw a Billy Mays
commercial for Zorbeez. This prod-
uct is nearly identical to the Sham-
Wow!, and Mays uses similar dem-
onstrations. The difference is the
salesman.

Well, thanks but no, thanks, Vince
Offer I’m going to stay with a man I
know and trust There is something
soothing about Billy Mays of which
I cannot let go. Is it his beard? Is it his
voice? I’m not sure. But one  is
clear: If it isn’t broken, then donft ﬁx
it.

And if it is broken, use Mighty
Mendit.

ship is beyond me. I was particu-
larly unimpressed by STANDM’s
awareness—raising project where it
folded 137 origami cranes and put
up signs saying, “Each of these
cranes stands for one person
who could be killed by genocide
in Darfur, Minn., if there was a
genocide in Darfur, Minn., and
they killed every single’ person in
the whole place.”

Who cares? Darfur, Minn.,
is 15 hours away! Call me cold-
hearted, but it’s no sweat off my

back! And also, there is no geno-
cide there.

I argue that STANDM’s recent
divestment campaign did more
harm than good. All it accom-
plished was to deprive Darfur of
its dollar store. The bewildered lo-
cals found themselves compelled
to travel long distances to nearby
Comfrey just to obtain basic sup-
plies for some festive Halloween
and Thanksgiving decorating. Ev-
eryone is just trying not to even
think about Christmas. A’ coat

to burn down people's houses

drive for the 10,000 isolated and
ill—equipped African Union troops
huddled over campﬁres in a beet
ﬁeld has strained everybody’s
pocketbook.

Now a people on the brink,
the simple villagers ﬁnd their
lives complicated by faraway un-
dergrads with too much free time
on their hands. Two whole days
of the city clerk’s week are sunk
sifting through buckets of letters,
heartfully rendered by English
writing majors, demanding she

quit ordering air attacks.

Worship at the Lutheran
church serving the region’s Chris-
tian majority — estimated at 100
percent of the population — is
spooky and tense ever since some
bright—eyed Pitt students came
one day to announce Arab ma-
rauders from the North would ar-
rive any moment and start cutting
everyone’s hands off. I

Many locals are packing up
their confused lives to cross the
border into Jackson County. Re-

lief organizations will be over-
whelmed, because, who knows
for sure, but there is probably not
even a homeless shelter there or
any relief organizations of any
sort at all, given the small popu-
lation and last week’s Habitat
Against Humanity emergency
ﬁeld trip to the area.

I hope that in the upcoming
SGB elections, a candidate ad-
dresses my concerns.

‘Then and Now‘ shows Pittsburgh's queer history

Images ﬁom the Hill District's colorful past on display Downtown

by Katie Blemler
Staﬁ’ Writer

“Then and Now”

Space Gallery
812 Liberty Ave.
through Dec. 31, 2008

Ten years ago, Pittsburgh art-
ist and minister Deryck Tines
was walking down the street in
the Strip District when he was
overwhelmed by the discovery
of ’black—and-white photographs
from more than 50 years ago of
people who appeared to be living
his current life —- they were black,
queer, and they lived in the Hill
District.

The lively black—and-white
snapshots of elaborately coiffed,
elegantly styled cross-dressers
performing and having a good
time in small clubs and bars, often
among a mixed crowd of individ-
uals, reveal the little-known but vi-
brant history of the Hill District’s
queer community in the ’30s, ’40s
and ’50s. Tines knew this history
needed to be seen and celebrated.

 

This is a celebration of queer-
ness or whatever that means
or whatever it looks like, and

it's not just gay people but

straight people celebrating
with gay people
Deryck

 

Tines

In “Then and Now,” on dis-
play at Space Gallery Downtown,
Tines, guest—curator of the show,
juxtaposes these and other photo-
graphs of this rich history from
the Carnegie’s Teenie Harris Ar-
chive with photographs and other
media that reveal the contempo-
rary community as captured by
15 current Pittsburgh photogra-
phers.

The main difference between

then and now, Tines said, is that
now there is a greater awareness
of the queer community. More
people have come out today, and
more people are conscious of the
queer lifestyle in general, which he
credits to television, the Internet
and the fact that people feel open
to talk more freely now.

“That we are able to celebrate
openly, publicly in wonderful spac-
es [is what’s different today],” said
Tines. “In your space, in some-
body’s space —— how wonderful
this thing is. So that’s what is hap-
pening here. This is a celebration
of queerness or whatever that
means or whatever it looks like,
and it’s not just gay people but
straight people celebrating with
gay people. All this is not queer
people  it’s queer and straight
and black and white and old and
young.”

The diversity of the show’s
current works, from a collage of
heavily muscled bare men’s chests
to color photographs of the ev-
eryday street scene, illustrates
the range of this increased con-
sciousness. An iPod audio display
includes individuals in today’s
lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-
gender community sharing their
experiences of confronting the
stereotypes that exist even with
this increased awareness.

“Then and Now” is the most
recent phase of Tines’ The Car-
ryin’ On Project. The first phase
of the project was a show that
included only the photographs
from the Teenie Harris Archives.
It opened at the'\Y/arhol Museum
in the summer of 2007.

After discovering the original
photographs on the streets, Tines
realized there might be more in
the Carnegie’s Teenie Harris Ar-
chive. The archive contains more
than 80,000 images taken by Har-
ris in the Hill District’s heyday
from the ’30s to the ’60s, when
Tines explains the Hill District

“How to Choose Happiness  Most
of the Time: Thirty Ways in Thirty
Days” ’ -

_ By Pitt alum Chappale Burton B

Life is ﬁlled with choices. Pitt alum
Chappale Burton would argue that being
happy is one of them.

Burton’s book, “How to Choose Hap-
piness  Most of the Time: Thirty Ways in
Thirty Days,” which came out in early Sep-
tember, discusses the strategies for ﬁnding
andmaintaining the type of happiness that
helped Burton through the difﬁculties in
his life. i

“My deﬁnition. of happiness is basically
living as fully as you are capable of living
at this moment in timeand truly appreci-
ating life for the miracle that it is. That’s
something that we can choose to focus on,
because we control our own thoughts and
emotions,” said Burton.

These ways to happiness include mak-
ing nightly lists of things to be grateful for
before going to sleep or exercising to cre-
ate a healthier mind and body, as well as

,mental activities like starter questions for

daily self—contemplation such as, ‘Am I do-
ing my best?’ or ‘What is my ideal future’?

“It’s an experiential book; it’s not just
reading about it. I’ve used the techniques in

my book myself to overcome what could
have been potentially a really tragic life,
and I wanted to share those techniques,”
said Burton.

Burton ‘attended Pitt with a track schol-
arship,vgraduating in 1991 with a degree in
psychology before going on to work. as a
milieu therapist at Western Psychiatric In-
stitute and Clinic. After leaving WPIC he

pursued an acting career, before starting

his current career as a motivational speaker
and author. But before all of his successes,
Burton experienced mental and physical
abuse and witnessed the murder of his
parents at the age of 8.

Burton refused to allow these traumas .

to ruin his life, instead focusing on the

positive aspects and his potential. With.

the support of his maternal grandmother
and his athletic coaches he was able to go
to college, where he ﬂourished, even be-

_ coming Pitt’s homecoming king his senior

year. ,
Of his experiences at Pitt, Burton said,
“I had a lot of wonderful experience and
met a lot of wonderful people, but the
most important thing, hands down, is that
I learned how to learn. That’s the key: The
world is at your ﬁnger tips if you’re open
to it.” '
Burton feels that his background makes
him uniquely qualiﬁed. as a specialist on
happiness. “I had an extremely tragic child-
hood, and I never had any therapy. I basi-
cally did therapy on myself.” Burton found

 

much solace in the self—help movement,
becoming more enthusiastic and develop-
ing what he describes as a different appre-
ciation for life. J

“My friends used to tell me I should
bottle that energy and sell it as liquid sun-

Courtesy Chappale Burton

shine, so writing this book was the next
best  I "took those things that worked
for me and used them to provide a system-
atic approach to. happiness. That was my
way of bottling sunshine.”

But if happiness is indeed attainable

Pitt alum explains 'HoW to Choose Happiness'

through choice, why be happy only ‘most

_ of the time’? Burton explained this ratio-

nale, saying, “We’re human beings, and it’s
important to leave room for tears and for
imperfections. Being happy doesn’t mean

, you have to be happy 100 percent of the

time. Happy and sad are two sides of the
same coin; if you’ve never been sad, how
can you appreciate happiness? I like to
say that ‘bad’ emotions aren’t necessarily
bad.” . ’

Skeptics of self—help should note that
Burton does not advocate substituting
his methods for conventional treatment
methods. “I deﬁnitely believe in traditional

‘therapy. If someone is clinically depressed,

the most important thing is that they get

-help from a psychiatrist or psychothera-

pist, and then this book is a supplement to

, that. This is not somethingipeople should

do by themselves. It’s really important that
you have a supportive environment.”
Burton and his wife co-own a self-
development company, "Monday Smiles,"
which provides products and services to
individuals and businesses to motivate the

~ celebration of every day, even the dreaded

start of the work week.

“Don’t get me wrong, weekends are
great, but there are people who wake up
and are like, “Ugh, it’s Monday again.”'It
goes back to my deﬁnition of happiness,
about living and appreciating each day. I’m
just as happy to wake up on a Monday as
on a Friday.” B

 'Soul Men‘ lacks the jazz to impress orentertain

Staff Writer_

"Soul Men"

Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Bernie
Mac, Jennifer Coolidge, Sean Hayes,
Isaac Hayes

Directed by: Malcolm D. Lee
Distributed by: Dimension Filmsl
Metro-Goldvvyn-Mayer

“Soul Men” is like theiessay
you had to write for your Eng-
lish teacher 40 minutes before
class started. It’s made up of just
enough bull to persuade your
teacher into giving you a fat,
fresh 

“Soul Men” seems like it was

V whipped up 40 minutes before
it premiered. It starts off with a
premise that would have to catch
the audience on an extremely

boring day to interestit.

V Floyd_ Henderson (Bernie
Mac) and Louis Hinds (Samuel
L. Jackson) are the backup soul
singers of Marcus Hook (a John
Legend cameo) and must travel

. cross-country to play at Hook’s

funeral. Neither have performed

or spoken to each other in more

than 20_ years. .
With episode after episode
of repetitive, simplistic humor,

the cliches start to rip at the-

soul. It really becomes work
staying seated comfortably in
the theater. Almost every come-
dic rechnique and strategy is as
predictable as the ending of a
"Dora the Explorer" episode.

Racial humor is thrown ev-
erywhere in “Soul Men,” and the
characters areinowhere near be-
lievable or complex.

Perhaps Samuel L._ Jackson
plays a “deep” character by be-
ing mysterious and playing that

_ tough-guy role "that he’s known
for. But why sit and watch “Soul

Men” when you could just turn
on “Pulp Fiction” and see Jack-
son play the role that youwant
him to play?

It is unfair to put blame on
the actors, though. Jackson and
Mac play their characters to the
best of their abilities with the
utmost energy. Unfortunately,
it’s not enough to hold this ﬁlm
above the murky waters‘ of fail-
ure. ’

Bernie ’ Mac is fun in this
movie. It is one of the only ﬁlms
he’s been in the" past few‘ years
where the sole emotion the au-
dience should have for him -isn’t
pity. It’s not only evident that he

is having fun making this movie,
but. also that everyone work-
ing directlywith him is enjoying
himself, too. '

It would be extremely in‘-
triguing to  Mac and Jack-
son together again in another
ﬁlm because their relationship
in “Soul Men” would have been
absolutely entertaining to watch
if the writing wasn’t so awful. It
is a shame that this pairing can
never happen again, because
Mac passed away of sarcoidosis
in August. .

“Soul Men” should ' have
stayed in the oven for an extra

month or two. Why doesn’t the

comedy go further? Why does
the writing have to be so shallow
and oversimpliﬁed? _

“Soul Men” doesn’t have_any
substance to it. It’s a 90-minute

' shame of “what could’ve been.”

This ﬁlm is hard to talk about
because there isn’t anything deep

to think about afterward, and it’

doesn’t provide much short-term
entertainment while watching.
Perhaps the only thing worth
watching in “Soul Men” is during
the credits when the ﬁve-minute

“in memoriam” to Bernie Mac-

and Isaac Hayes appears. Thisis
possibly the most respectful and

Peppers: an overlooked and

by Margaret Krauss
Staff U7/iter

‘Restaurant cooking on a budget
Giant Eagle bill: $22.18

Dinner for four + copious leftovers:
$15.61

, Short of some friendly matron deliver-
ing a laden picnic basket to your doorstep, _
the decision to cook or not to cook often

I vies with the constraints of a workload.

Limited time, compounded by a pantry.
lacking the deep stores of a parent, it might
seem easier to just eat a granola bar slath—
ered with peanut butter or boil some pasta.
But you’re better than that. v.

As the economy spirals cheerfully into
the depths of a full—blown recession, imag-
ination becomes an invaluable asset. Even
while students forgo the price tags of res’-
taurants for the aisles of the grocery store,
there is no reason to wave a sad goodbye to
great ﬂavor and atmosphere. ,

Instead of critiquing the sauces and
service of one  Pittsburgh’s many ﬁne
restaurants, I’ve set my sights on the ﬁnal
frontier: Armed with naught but a student
budget (i.e., no money at all) and the one
skill college students are renowned for, re-
sourcefulness, I aimed to convert my house
into a Zagat destination.

The first stop was the grocery store.
There are a number of small groceries
throughout Oakland, Shadyside and Squir-
rel Hill that can add affordable spark to
your cupboards. .

But in order to build a pantry that
can help you make dinner in a ﬂash, Gi-
ant Eagle is a good place from which to
launch. Your staples will vary dependingion

tasty restaurant alternative

your tastes, but I cannot get along without
these foodstuffs: fresh garlic, onion, lemon
juice, salt, spinach, tomatoes, carrots, rai-
sins, chickpeas, black beans and couscous.
These few things can be worked into any
number of forms, but I wanted to make
something distinctive and different — a
dish that I could make for a dinner party or
something myroommates and I could eat
for a weekend lunch. -

Enter the pepper. An unassuming veg-
etable, the pepper is most often found
pulling shifts as salad garnish or fodder for

salsa. But let’s take a moment to redraw '

the bell pepper’s possibilities._ According
to Cornell University’s horticultural Web
site, green bell pepper's, by weight, con-
tain twice as much vitamin C as oranges or
grapefruits, providing a whopping 134_per-
cent of your daily recommended intake.

Beyond its nutritional value, the pepper
is the kitchen’s equivalent to a good wing-
man, always ready to jump in just when
things get awkward. You have a can of
black beans, half an onion and some corn
hanging around? What you have, friends,
is a dinner of _stuffed peppers — there is
no right or wrong, and the pepper is kind
to both vegetarians and ornnivores. Here is
the basic equation: Vegetables and a pro-
tein, whether beans or meat, plus a carb
(couscous, rice, pasta) equals satisfaction.

I had decided to try out both meat and
vegetarian stuffed peppers. My roommate
Suzie and I stood in our narrow kitchen,
sizing up saucepans like generals.taking the
measure of their troops before mounting
a major offensive. The raw makings of the

feast covered our kitchen’s available coun— _

ter space.
After organizing everything we needed,

we cut the tops off of our peppers to per?

mit filling. Then we lined a small baking

‘Then and Now’ on display Downtown

‘Then and Now’, page 8
was the place to be, outside of New York
and Chicago.

Tines did ﬁnd 40 additional photographs
in the archives that included queer life. He
paid to have the images printed from the
negatives, and with the help of a $50,000
donation from a private friend, Tines was
able to start the project. j

The Carryin’ On Project seeks to cel-

I ebrate the queer community, especially that

_or the Hill District, by exposing its rich his-

tory. ‘

In celebrating queer life, Tines con-
fronts the stigma and stereotypes that have
historically surrounded the community.

The project is named after the terminol-
ogy that queer people often used to refer to
their lives in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s.

“People didn’t use the terms gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender,” said Tines. “It wasn’t
spoken of like that. There were other terms
for it.‘ We were just carryin’ on.”

Tines explained that queer life was just
another part of the vibrant Hill District
community that Harris captured.

“A lot of these people were perform-
ers,” said Tines. “That’s how they made

their living. So there was no real trouble -

because they were going to work. You went
to work and then you went home. A lot
of these’ people dressed like this every day.
They went to church like this, went to the
grocery store like this.”

The everyday scenes of diverse com-

munity members mixing together in private ’

and public spaces and bringing their unique
experiences into the larger world celebrates
and affirms the life of every individual.

“If people enjoy people and enjoy life,”
Tines said, “if people want to be larger than
their surroundings, larger than their worlds,
want to expand themselves, this is the ex-
hibit to check out. Otherwise, it’s not for
the faint of heart.”

dish with tin foil (you can also use a baking
sheet) and popped the empty peppers into
a 350—degree oven for 15 minutes-.

While the peppers softened, we set
about prepping an assortment of vegeta-
bles for the stufﬁng. We chopped half of

an onion and six cloves of garlic, separating '

them into two piles to be used in both the
meat and veggie ﬁllings. Whatever ingredi-
ents you choose to throw together in your
peppers, it is best to always saute garlic and
onion before you add other ingredients, al-
lowing the ﬂavors to emerge and mingle.
Suzie’s computer rolled, through her
iTunes library: The smooth tones of Iron
and Wine,- the Decembrists and other sur-
prise musical guests added a palpable ease
to our workaday experimentation. After we
ﬁnished, sauteing the two ﬁllings; adjusting
spices to our tastes, we ﬁlled our peppers
and returned the baking dish to the oven

for another 15 minutes. From start to ﬁn- -

ish, dinner took 40 minutes to assemble,

prepare and cook. '
While we prayed for delicious outcomes,

I cleared away the kitchen and set the table,

‘ creating an atmosphere I would want to eat

in — forks and knives set, "a seasonal ar-
rangement of leftover gouxds and pump-
kins in the center ‘of the table. _

Gray clouds hung heavily in the after-
noon sky, November ﬁnally living up to its
seasonal chill as my roommates and I sat
down to lunch, bundled in sweaters. The

-peppers came steaming out of the oven._

After a few thoughtful bites my roommates
offered compliments and suggestions be-
fore returning reluctantly to their home:

touchdown, Turner’s catch and
a Conor Lee ﬁeld goal.

Pitt came out of the half with
the longest drive of its season,
resulting in another three points
from Lee. But good ﬁeld position
for Louisville after the ensuing
kickoff led to a 30-yard touch-
down from Cardinals’ quarterback
Hunter Cantwell to receiver Troy
Pascley, cutting the lead to 13.

Still, Louisville wasn’t celebrat-
ing for long.

After a Pitt punt and a failed
fourth—down conversion for Lou-
isville, Stull and Pitt faced a third-
and-l8. Stull dropped back and
connected with freshman receiver
Jonathan Baldwin for 44 yards
down the right side. McCoy, who
gained more than 140 yards in
each of Pitt’s previous five games,
lined up in the W/ildcat forma-

tion on the next play and took it .

11 yards for his only score of the
game.

“They did a great job of stack-
ing the box,” said Wannstedt of
the Louisville defense. “This was
a game when we needed to force
some turnovers. We did.”'

The turnovers, which started
when Louisville muffed three
punts in the first halﬁ continued
giroughout the second half.

Two possessions after McCoy’s
touchdown, Cantwell threw a
misdirection pass to tailback Vic-
tor Anderson backwards that was
dropped. Players from both teams
gtopped momentarily, thinking
the play was over. But Pitt corner
Ricky Gary picked up the loose
ball and took it three yards for the
score. ‘

McKillop intercepted a
gantwell pass on Louisville’s next
possession, then took it 18 yards

for another defensive touchdown, _

securing Pitt’s win.

“Today was pretty clean,” said
\X/annstedt. “The last few weeks,
the last few games we’ve won, that
has not been the case.”

Pitt has a week off before trav-
eling to Cincinnati for another Big
East matchup Nov. 22.

Michaeeaterl Phot ditor
Scott McKillop, Austin Ransom and the Pitt defense came up big against Louisville on Saturday, scoring

Thankfully for Stull and the

In its ﬁnal tune-up before its
season opener, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team dominated La Roche
from start to ﬁnish yesterday in
an 82-30 pounding.

Sam Young paced the Pan-
thers with 18 points, while Tyrell
Biggs and Jermaine Dixon totaled
11 points each.

Every Pitt player scored, but
the defense was the key. The 30
points scored by La Roche was
the least amount of points Pitt
has ever given up in an exhibition
game. The Redhawks shot 23.8
percent for the contest and com-
mitted 26 turnovers.

The win was Pitt’s 20th straight
exhibition victory.

Point guard Levance Fields,
who practiced this week, sat out
for the second straight game.

“It’s his decision,” said Dixon.
“We had hoped he’d be back by
now It’s not where we thought it
would be. But we have to recog-
nize what it is. He’s been injured
for 11 months.”

Fields could be ready for the
regular—season opener on Friday
against Farleigh Dickinson.

Forward Gilbert Brown also
did not play for the Panthers.
Dixon said that Brown has a
chance of returning on Friday
but that he hasn’t done anything
since suffering a stress fracture in
his left foot last week.

The only change in the start-
ing lineup from last week’s exhibi-
tion game against Seton Hill was
the insertion of Dixon for Brad
Wanamaker at shooting guard.
Young, Biggs, Dejuan Blair and
Ashton Gibbs rounded out the
initial ﬁve.

Young’s seven rebounds also
led Pitt. The senior hustled around
the court, tipping loose balls and
keeping possessions alive. The

rest of the team followed suit for
the duration of the game.

“It’s something we talked
about before the game,” said
Dixon. “I was happy with our at:
titude today.” I

Young started at small forward
but said he still is adjusting to the
position. He started at power for-
ward last season.

“I still see myself running all
the way down to the block instead
of ﬁlling out on the wing,” said
Young. “I think as we continue to
play, it’s going to become more
normal. I don’t see it as a prob-
lem. Actually, when I become as
comfortable as I was before, I
think we can be an even better
team than last year.”

La Roche junior guard Dylan
Grazier led the Redhawks with
seven points.

Pitt started the game on a 12-4
run, highlighted by a thunderous
dunk by Young over La Roche
center David Culp.

Penn State's perfect season smashed, W V U falls,

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Eaitor

Joe Paterno’s dream of a third
national title just couldn’t survive
past Saturday.

Iowa kicker Daniel Murray
knocked through a 31-yard ﬁeld
goal with one second left, and the
Hawkeyes secured a come—from-
behind upset of No. 3 Penn State,
24-23, crushing its national title
hopes for good.

There were talks among col-
lege football experts about Pa-
terno, who is now in his 43rd year
of coaching, missing out on a na-
tional championship game even
if the team did go undefeated.
Penn State trailed Alabama and
Texas Tech in the BCS rankings
heading into Saturday and had
been left out of the champion-
ship game in the past even after
going undefeated. But this game
silenced those talks, forcing the
Nittany Lions back four spots in
the Top 25 to No. 7.

Penn State will now focus
its eyes on the Big 10 title and a

berth to the Rose Bowl, which it
can secure by winning the‘ rest of
its games.

Iowa tailback Shonn Greene
rushed for 117 yards and two
touchdowns. The junior ran for
147 yards and a touchdown in a
loss to Pitt Sept. 20.

Big East bash

With its win over’ Louisville,
Pitt jumped from No. 25 to No.
21, making it the highest-ranked
team in the Big East. Cincin-
nati, which upset West Virginia
at home in overtime Saturday
night, jumped to No. 22, while
the Mountaineers dropped out
of the Top 25. A

West Virginia was undefeated
in the Big East before its match-
up with Cincinnati and now sits
in a three—way tie for first with
Pitt and the Bearcats.

Pitt can secure the Big East
title with wins over Cincinnati
and West Virginia in its next two
games.

attempts, and went 4 for 11 in the ﬁrst 20
minutes. But La Roche couldn’t take advan-
tage, as Pitt’s defense clamped down and
limited the Redhawks’ ability to ﬁnd any
open looks.

Unlike last week against Seton Hill, the
Panthers put La Roche away in the ﬁrst
half. The Redhawks only shot 20 percent
from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst half, while Pitt
notched 51.7 percent of its shots.

Young led the Panthers with eight ﬁrst-
half points. The nine players who touched
the court all scored, leading to a 37-14 half-
time advantage.

Pitt then blew the gates off to open the
second half. It scored the first 13 points
of the half and led, 50-14. Young scored
10 points in the ﬁrst seven minutes before
coming out of the game for good.

When Young exited with 13 minutes to
go in the game, his point tally, of 18 was
higher than La Roche’s entire team total,
which was 17.

The Redhawks only scored ﬁve points
in the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the second half. A
Gibbs jumper with 9:16 to go in the game
placed Pitt ahead, 63-19.

Guard Ryan Tiesi hit a 3—pointer with 28
seconds remaining to ﬁnish the scoring.

Louisville clearly focused on stufﬁng Mc-

a career-low 39 rushing yards, which is all the
more surprising considering that he topped

caused problems for the opposing defense.

Baldwin caught two long passes for 80
yards, both leading to clutch touchdowns. The
first was a 36-yard dart that came one play af-
ter W1ight’s 76-yard touchdown run was called
back because of a holding  Wright
would later score.

The second came on a third—and-18, when
Stull lobbed a pretty pass that Baldwin pulled
down in single coverage for 44 yards. Seconds
later, McCoy took a direct snap 11 yards for a
score and a 27-7 lead.

“We’re going to try to establish 'our 
game no matter what — that’s our bread and
butter,” said Stull.‘ “But, [we need] to be able to
‘have the conﬁdence with the coaches and our
guys up front and our skill guys, to have the
faith in me to ﬁnd someone who’s open and if
not to make the smart play and throw it away.”

Baldwin is a potential force any time he

steps on the gridiron. With Stull at the helm,
his talent can be utilized to the highest possible
degree.

Bostick can be an accurate quarterback,
but last; week he missed Baldwin and the other
receivers too often. Stull holds the advantage
over Bostick ir1 terms of mobility and arm
strength as well.

While the offensive line struggled to open
holes for McCoy, it pass-blocked admirably,
giving Stull ample time to maneuver in the

backﬁeld. When the pocket broke down, Stull
moved around and made the right throw Bo-
stick doesn’t have that capability at this stage in
his career.

Warmstedt admitted after the Notre Dame
game that his passing game was limited with-
out Stull. Against Louisville, Pitt threw down
the ﬁeld quick slants, screens, outs and ins,
early and often. ’

Pitt’s dismantling of the Cardinals is a
warning to the rest of the Big East It scored

“We want to get to the main one,” said
Stull. “We love the fact that we decide our own
