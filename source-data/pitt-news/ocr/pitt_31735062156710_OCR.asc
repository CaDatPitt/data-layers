was elected to the position of
scribe during the Spring term.
Miss Williams withdrew from the-
University this month. ‘

Since Irene Maloney, Miss Wil-
liam’s running mate, did not re-
enter school this term, it was nec-
essary to consider a third party
for the position.

According to WSGA policy, the
new secretary was chosen by ap-
pointment rather than by an elec-
tion. The executive committee of
WSGA, headed by Corinne Nelan,
president, made the appointment.

The second replacement in-
volves Senior Court. One of the
members of the court, Eleanor
Lynch, also withdrew this semes-
ter. Joanne Kelly, a senior men-

on the judicial board in place of
Miss Lynch.

ﬁrst time in the history of Wom-

Guyler Tells Interrupted Vets:
"Expect No Checks Til Nov. I "

The Pittsburgh office of the VA
recently warned veterans entering
school for the fall term and stu-
dents who interrupted their
schooling during the summer, not
to expect their September sub-
sistence checks until October
checks are sent early in Novem-
ber. 1
Current. plans of the VA call for
payment as usual to students who
have attended summer school.

According to Alvin R. 'Guyler,
manager of the Veterans Admini-
stration regional ofﬁce here, dis-
abled veterans studying under
Public Law 16 also will receive
their checks as usual.

Guyler disclosed that this pro-
cedure was adopted by VA offices
throughout the country to avoid_
the confusion which would arise
from attempting, to issue thous-
ands of special checks covering
periods of less than a month at a
time when school and VA facili-
ties are strained in handling oth-
er work relating to new schoo
enrollments. _ 5

There will be still another ser-

brought about by the free use of

Final deﬁnite policy for the op-

been fully determined, according
to Dean T. W_ Biddle; in fact,
suggestions for desk operations
are requested from any group

Activities Boom

Stiudengh interest in activities seems to be
on the increase, especially as far as publications
are concerned.‘-

For .the past week students have been ﬂock-
ing to the various offices on the eighth ﬂoor

seeking positions on the three publications.’

While the News ofﬁce is overﬂowing with
sports writers and reporters, the Owl is re-
cruiting salesmen. The Panther also has~ex-
perienced a small avalanche of writers.

We certainly welcome this show of eager-
ness toward our various staﬁ's and we hope the
people who have offered their time will not
lose their initial interest. Too long has the
News, Panther and Owl been haﬁmstrung by
a lack of sufficient personnel to share work
and responsibility. I *

So far, however, the students who have ap-
plied_ just “want to work for the News”. We

‘cannot help admiring their desire to help but

it ishard to fit these “jacks—0f-all-trades” into

such a specialized ﬁeld as the publication of ai

twice-weekly paper.

The News and the other publications need
specialists; persons who know how to write a
feature article; reporters who will not edit-
orialize; photographers who will not complain
about an assignment; copy readers who will

‘not make mistakes and’ any person who is

willing to give a .great deal of time and ef-
fort to any job they may secure.

In addition, we need students who will be
willing to pass up the special assignments to
do more tedious work such as rewriting.

The efforts of anyone who worksfor the
News will be amply rewarded, perhapsinot in
finoney, but in the satisfaction of a job well

one.

Music
Notes
By Jerry Newberg

Music lovers, we are ready for the ne“
semester.

Tomorrow Evening

Trio of Mosque

Taking the spotlight at the Mosque- t
morrow night will be the King Cole Trio. T
“King” (Nat Cole) is an Albany boy whos
scintillating piano artistry and personal, in.
timate vocal stylings have won many a follow
er. Cole is blended with two superb musicians
Oscar Moore, fhaster of the electrically-ampli
ﬁed guitar, and Johnny Miller whose bass W0
is a vital componant of the Trio’s performance..

This combination forms one of the mos
popular instrumental and vocal aggregation
in the realm of American Jazz. The group _
greatest record hit was achieved by their Capi-3
tol recording “For Sentimental Reasons.”

For those of you who wish to add some

’King Cole hits to your record collection be

sure to get the Capitol album BD8 which con 1
sists of such standards as “Sweet Lorraine,’
“Embraceable You,” “The Man I Love,” and,
“Body and Soul.” A

Their other album BD29 is not done a"
well. However, it contains ﬁne arrangements
of “I’m Through With LoVe,”. “I’miIn Th
Mood For LoVe” and “I Don’t Why.”

The Trio’s latest release is “Naughty An-,—
geline” with ,,the “King” givinggoods advic.
to a nice but ﬂighty gal. This side I know
you’ll like. On the ﬂipover is “That’s What’
and it will make you say “what’s that?” Th

Panthers on Display I

Tomorrow—Picked

To Win Four Games

Tomorrow afternoon at Champaign, Mike Milligan and his
"assistants put on display a product upon which they
e labored for over two months. How well they have per-

ed their task will be evident tomorrow at 5 p. m., Pitts-, ‘

gh time.

’It’s been.a long hard pull for both the team and the
ches. They switched from Wes Fesler’s modiﬁed “T” to the
erland-style single wing, which meant continuing the con-
ration on fundamentals begun under Fesler. It has been

gc

, block, and more block.

'Pr'obably_no other system requires as much patience ,to
gftall as does the single wing. Milligan and his staﬂ have
’n'ty’ of that. It required also much hard work and coopera-
,n from the team. They responded nobly.

co. many, the single wing means
straight-ahead power. A
em which is unspectacular, oc-
nally boring, but does win
V-rnes. This is not Milligan’s sin-
wing. A man doesn’t spend

and weak blocking have held him
back, but he is expected to come
around before the season is over.

Meantime, most of the ﬂinging
willbe handled by Cecconi, Lee,
and DePasqua. This means plenty
of oifensive action for Bill Mc-
Peak and Leo Skladany who be-
gin their third season as regular
ﬂankers. Another frequent target

Johnson Comes Through

Milligan is well fortiﬁed at the
guards. A pleasant surprise is
Buck Johnson, letter winner in
1945, who will team-_-up with last
year’s stalwart, Bernie Barkouskie.
When Buck pulls out of the line,
it’s like snapping a whip_ In ad-
dition, there are Johnny Kosh.
Tony Rozzano, and Earl Sumpter.

‘Forsythe are the only question

marks in the starting line. Bob

It’s a matter of insuﬂicient ex-
perience with'Radnor and lack of
strength with ‘Forsythe. Wib has
not completely recovered from a
serious throat infection. Irregard-
less, Milligan rates high for his
line-building ability, and his repu-
tation won’t suffer this season.

I pick the Panthers to win four
games. With the possible exception
of Notre Dame, no one will run
up a score against the Milligan-
coached eleven. There’s one thing
that should be remembered. Pitt
hasn’t lost any of last season’s
ﬁght. They won’t lose their games
in the dressing room. .

Prognosticate

Don’t tip off Police Lieutenant
Maloney, but, conﬁdentially, , the
football writers, caught in a weak
moment, by their satin-tongued
head man, J oh‘n Golightly, of the
ﬁrm of Zeller, Workmaster, and
Golightly, humor mongers with-
out parallel, have been designated
as the swamis for Pitt’s “under-
cover” football pool bookies.

Each —week, using dope that’s
strictly from the horse’s (Max
Scherb’s) mouth, the pigskin pen-
men will do a bit of “yogiing”
over some of the week’s top grid
classics, _

The seers wish it to be known
that, in direct deﬁance of a, com-
munique from the office of T. A.
Perkinson, Panther editor, who
INSISTS that the Panthers will
be “red hot” this year, they will
not pick Pitt to win a game if it’s
against their better judgment.

-Regardless of the brand new
whip of News Art Editor Mim
Cooper, that Boss Golightly was
snapping dangerously close to our
talented craniums, we gridiron
scribes stout-heartedly refused to
quote odds or give points.

It was bad enough I that we
“agreed” to pick the winners, for
it seems there is a shortage of

honored alumnus, ‘ Robert “Ego”

  Chances Slim
For Pitt Win

Hopes of a Panther upset over
the Illini are fading in the face of
late reports from the Champaign
campus. The Eliotmen are ru-
mored to be packing as much
power as last year’s Rose Bowl
winner.

Seven regulars are back from
the team that won the Big Nine
championship, and replacements
for the four graduates are consid-
ered adequate. In addition, the
Illini can boast of at least 26 let-
termen on their squad. This ‘ex-
perienced nucleus is an able nu-
cleus for Eliot’s plans.

At the mention of Paul Patter-
son,
and successor, Illinois partisans
grow lyrical. Although a bit
slower than the peerless Buddy,
Paul isthe sensation of the Or-
ange and Blue campus.

Patterson Runs, Kicks, Passes

The 185-pound colored boyfrom
Aurora, Illinois is being heralded
as better all-around player than
Young. He is a better than aver-
age left-handed passer, and a sen-

Buddy Young’s understudy '

sational receiver. He can also run, _ ‘

kick, and, despite his relatively

light weight, backs up theline on ,

defense.

Pitt rooters will be able to see
Perry Moss in action for the ﬁrst
time tomorrow afternoon. Al-
though Moss was a regular last
year, his eligibility was question-
ed by the Conference around Pitt
game time. Eliot benched him un-
til the week after the game when
he was okayed.

The remainder of the backﬁeld
includes Captain Art Duifelmeier,
the Big Nine’s leading ground

gainer last year, and Russ Steger‘

at fullback. Steger is a line shat-
tering bucket and he can run the

. ﬂanks when necessary_

Veterans Handle Terminals
The terminals are regarded as
the strong posts in the Illinois

line. Veterans Sam Zatkoﬁ and,_.

Ike Owens are repeating at the
ﬂanks they protected in ’46. The
two are both 27-years-old and are
noted for their defensive perform-
ances. I ,

Lou Agase and Bob Cunz, both
big and fast, are at the tackles.
Herb Siegert and John Wrenn will
start at the guards and Lou Le-
vantin will hold down the cen-

ter. Eliot is deep in replacements

in all line positions.
Big Nine Teams Slated

Although the complete .1948

schedule is not yet ready for re-
lease, Pitt will meet three Big _

Nine foes. Indiana, Purdue, and
Ohio State are deﬁnitely on the
1948 slate. ’

It will be the sixth scheduled en-
counter with Indiana, the ﬁfth
meeting with Purdue, and the
thirteenth clash with Ohio State.

Indiana’s. Bo McMillin says of
tackle John Goldsberry, “We
wouldn’t trade him for anybody’s
tackle.”

Weiektot Light Grid Drills  

A squad of more than 70 freshmen gridders under the coaching

of Ralph Mitterling and Doc Hartwig winds up its ﬁrst week of

drills today.

Working out at Trees Gym ﬁeld, the frosh have engaged in only
light work thus far. Rougher work, including scrimmage may begin

sometime next week.

As to the ability of the candidates, Doc Hartwig maintains, “It’s _

too early to tell a thing.”
