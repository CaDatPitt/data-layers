Platt Says Students Exploited

BY TOM "WENSTON
Pitt student employes possibly

-are being treated unfairly and

should consider unionization, Stu-
dent, Government Board (SGB)
President Larry Platt said at

_ Wednesday night’s meeting.

=... .!"“~

_‘ ‘I've heard. several complaints

from workers at Burger Chef and in
the Towers Cafeteria,” Platt said.
“The students are dealt with in an
arbitrary way, as if they’re an
exploitable commodity.”
After the meeting, Platt men-
tioned two possible goals the SGB
could try to facilitate for student
workers. “The ultimate goal would
be the unionization of student
workers,” Platt said.

“Before that is possible, we
could establish a . series‘ of
regulations for companies and
University departments that em-
ploy students, with speciﬁc rules
concerning student working hours,
pay and other similar matters.”

Platt said student complaints
warrant an investigation of the
issue. “The complaints are little,
but they deserve consideration.

“At Burger Chef, I’ve heard of
people being delayed in receiving
their paychecks. And in the
cafeteria, the students working in
the kitchen are paid the same wage
as the meal-ticket checkers,’_’ Platt
said. “Wages should be based on
theamount of work one has to put
in. ~
“I know student workers are
usually kept from working 40 hours
a week, so tuition remission
beneﬁts can be denied them,”
Platt said. “And I remember last
year there was an attempt to
reduce meal-plan benefits to
resident assistants. I'm against
that kind of arbitrary, unregulated
treatment of student employes.”

Platt added that as of yet, no
speciﬁc effort toward unionization
was being launched.

In other action, SGB member
Dan Stiﬁler reported that a student

food co-op in the Student Union .

should be ready to begin operation
by November 1. \

“If the Board could provide
funds for some of the overhead
expenses and give us a small cash
base, we’d be ready to start soon,”

Stifﬂer said. “Tom Albert (director_
of University Housing and Food
Service) can establish contacts, for
us with Strip District food
dealers.”

Board member Mark Satinoff
proposed partial funding of $500

for student bus trips to the National '

Student Conference Against Rac-
sim (SCAR) in Boston next week.
“The conference is needed to
help ‘begin a strong student
movement against racism through-
out the country,” Satinoff, a SCAR
member said. “In Boston, it is
especially important for us to put
pressure on city officials and police -
to provide protection for bused
black students.” ‘
" Platt was against the motion to
allocate funds toward the Student
Conference. “These kind of

conferences can go on and on,.and _

I’m not sure much will
accomplished.”

“I hope they do go on and on,”
Satinoff replied. “Larger scale
movements take time to develop.”

The Board voted to refer the
matter to the Allocations Commit-_
tee.

SGB member Tyrone “Chip”
Hubbard reported that he had
investigated several alternative
security systems for Pitt residence
halls. He will submit his plans _to
the Resident Student Association
(RSA) and the Office of Residence
Life. I

The Board approved allocations
for the Human Sexuality confer-
ence slated for next February. The
conference, which will feature
workshops and speakers on gay
sexuality, is sponsored by the Gay '
Students at Pitt.

SenateMeeting Endsln

Tenure LanguageC|cIshn

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Disagreements over a resolu-

tion to clarify language in a tenure
motion ended Thursday’s Univer-
sity Senate meeting after roll call_
showed low attendance.
' Opponents of \the resolution,
frustrated, by the ‘defeat of their
counter-resolution, called for a
count of the members present and
requested the meeting end when
the number was found to be below
requirements for a vote.

The resolution, according to
associate vice chancellor of the
Health Professions Edison Mont-
gomery, was created so tenure
discussions would not be stopped

Band Denies Discontent Rumor

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Members of Pitt’s marching
band denied reports last night that
they were dissatisﬁed with the
competency, of their director.

The reports, which came in the

' form of anonymous telephone calls,

said the band members were
openly attempting to unseat the
band's director, Donald E. Hower.

The reports speciﬁcally cited as

proof of the discontent a '14-page,

critique of Hower’s work‘ and a
petition calling for his removal
signed in March by about half the
band’s members and sent to the
Athletic Director. The band, the

callers said, was still divided on the _

question of Hower’s competency.

Band members who signed the
petition, however, said they had
since reversed their position.

“Hower has changed since last
year,” said John Mack, a graduate
student who helped draw up the
petition . ‘ ‘He’s
competency, and I’m satisﬁed now
with the job he’s doing.”

then the charge would be a

“If it were placed on our

  Health Care System

BY DENNIS KELLY

In spite of the advanced medical
expertise in America today, health
care is ' a luxury commodity,

according to Susan Beck, a nurse at

Allegheny General Hospital and
Socialist Workers’ Party candidate
A for Pittsburgh City Council.
Beck’s comments came yester-
day during the Young Socialist
Alliance forum in the Student
—Union. _ ' 
‘ ‘Our health care system is based
on profits,” Beck said. “The main
concern” seems _to;..be» not what
- America-needs but what itwill pay.

The proﬁt drive in ‘medicine,-

according to Beck, has led to the
poor distribution of health service,
unnecessary service to those‘ who
can pay, minimal service to those
who cannot pay, proﬁteering by
drug companies, racism and
sexism.

Inﬂated costs, aggravated by
government subsidies on a “cost-
plus” basis, -maintain a high-
paying demand _ while existing,
agencies like Blue Cross and Blue
Shield have done nothing tocombat
these costs. Blue Cross and Blue

“We tried talking about tenure
at meeting after meeting, and we_

accomplished nothing because ’

quorums were being called because
ofmisunderstandings,” Mont-
gomery said.

Opponents of the resolution, led '

by professor Benjamin F. Bart,
maintain such preliminary- mea-
sures are unnecessary and are an
attempt to prevent discussion of
the issue.

“We hear much of the desirabili-
ty of participation in Senate
matters, and yet the June Council

meeting rejected a proposal that we .

take up the Tenure ‘Commission
Report in any rational land
straightforward manner” said prfoi-
fessor John W. Chapman. “The

man indicated too few members

were present to technically act on .

Before the adjournment, »the‘li"': '

instructor William J. Brown was
elected president, Barbara ' K.

Out-going President Frank

Slaughter alluded to the difficulties : 7 ‘-S‘

over the tenure issue, and wished
his successor better luck.

“I became frustrated with the 
slow rates of the Senate’s tenure . 

debates," Slaughter said.

“There was continued wrang-_

ling. and meetings ended with no
resolution.

Chancellor _Wesley Posvar
praised the new president. “No
one will work with greater diligence

toadvance the purposes offaculty

“To get at the source of

America’s health crisis we must
reorganize the production ofhealth

should establish a directly control-

 The college campus at one time
’ Had the reputation of being a place

where sex was wet and wild.
Students, female as well as male,
were supposedly uninhibited, lust-
ful, experimentative and active in
sexual matters.

Well, as far as . Pitt today is
concerned, that seemed a some-
what false picture. So, I decided to
go to the students--armed with a
survey sheet and a notebook--
themselves. Some interesting
results came up.

'Before college, most students
said they had the stereotyped
image of the college sex scene. A
male sophomore said, “I was

I hoping there would be so much of it
ﬁﬁitt that I could burn myself out

“Er

the first two years and then be able
to concentrate more on studying
the last two.”

Most males interviewed had high
hopes of finding it easily and
getting it easily. ‘

Although females thought col-
lege was much freer sexually,
many admitted to never having
thought about it much until after
they went out with afew college
fellows. One freshwoman said
that just recently at a fraternity
party, about half a dozen guys

approached her, talked for a few

minutes, and then asked her if she
wanted to go upstairs.

After a few years here, attitudes
change. Men and women agreed a
lot oftalking about sex goes on, but
it doesn‘t reflect how much is
actually going on. Guys generally
agreed most males are “big
bu11shitters” when it comes to
sexual exploits. However, there
was agreement among those
interviewed that if you really want
it, you can ﬁnd it at Pitt. Not as
much goes on as is sometimes
claimed, but it’s not true either that
most are abstaining.

SEX--WHY OR WHY NOT

If presented with a willing
female, most guys would have no
qualms or moral constraints about
having sex. A junior engineering
student said, “If I’m attracted to
her, and she’s attracted to me, then
I'm ready for action.”

However, these same guys
thought sex was much better in the
context of some sort of relation-
ship. This relationship did not
necessarily have to he love, or one
pointing towards marriage, but
could be one of friendship.

But all males interviewed said
sex and love were separable.

Most females,’on the other hand,
said they felt sex was right for them
only in the context of a serious
relationship. Some were quick to
add that this didn't necessarily
mean marriage, or a relationship
that would eventually be one of
marriage. Living together was
acceptable to them. However, just
as‘ many thought a serious
relationship did mean marriage,
and this was the only place for a full
sexual relationship. ’ L

To the question of mutual sexual
attraction outside a relationship, a
majority of women said even if they
were sexually attracted ' to an
unknown guy and he to them, it
would not be all right to have sex.

A married grad student said she
never looked at any guy and
thought of him as sexually
attractive. Rather, she looks and
sees guys as good-looking, aver-
age, or not good-looking.

[NOTE: Along with the serious,
systematic look at sexual attitudes,
Undercover Reporter Paras also
distributed a questionnaire chock-
full of purportedly humorous
questions and purportedly humor-
ous answers. The second part of
his article deals with the results of
that questionnaire.]

HUMOR: RESPONSE TO
SURVEY SHEET
[100 polled--49 males, 50 females,
lneuter] '

Most students think parents
think they study quietly while at
school--it’s hard to believe parents
are that naive’. Some males,
however, said their parents
thought they “attended orgies” or
“turned into sex maniacs.”

For men and women alike, the
sex scene at Pitt generally borders
on “dull to non-existent.”
However, for a small segment of
people (25%), it is “truly excit-
ing,” and often “kinky.”

Five people said Pitt was “a
haven for their wildest fantasies.”
Otherwise, the answers ranged
from “false” to “dream on.”

People are having their most
exciting sexual experiences in their
dorms, houses or apartments.
However, the bathroom, the
library, Atwood Street and the
kitchen ﬂoor got an occasional
check mark. Nowhere, under the
bed, and the swimming pool at
Trees Hall--keep an eye out from
now on--were the most\ unusual
write-ins.

The large majority of females
thought they were “nice enough to
deserve a second look." Only two
thought they were “downright
erotic.” Guys modestly answered

A Test for Input

In the wake of student-input controversy come two opportunities for
disgruntled students to inﬂuence the decisions of administrators.

ﬂieupcomingstndyofundergraduate 
the planned survey on the eﬂectiveness of the Student Health Service
will provide students with ways to contribute the input that manyclaim

islaclnng.

Both areas under study play important roles in the student’s life at

' — , Pitt, one dealing with the immediate concerns of health, the other

involving the morerlong-range problems of counseling and seeking to
answer questions related to course selection, choice of a major, and

general University problems.

_ ' Student apathy in response to both studies would be self-defeating
and hypocritical in light of the recent clamor for more input into major
‘decisions. We reasonably can expect the student leaders who have
complained of certain administrators’ lack of receptiveness to student
opinion to participate .in_ both studies.

Since the studies come at such a timely moment in the steam of
campus events, there may be more at stake in the students’ response
than the immediate beneﬁts to health andcounseling. The officials
setting up the studies are showing prudence in soliciting student ideas.‘

Whether students follow through with the serious participation and

‘ concern we like to think we have, showing the administration that our

input matters enough to us to matter something to them, may very well
determine how many more “coupon distribution plans” are put over on

students in the future.

..T'~Rt'sing secularism

  I omit,

I 1' BY DAN MULHOLLAND

It has been said that history is
essentially a process of constant
change and that every period is

therefore as crucial as the one
— before. But a strong case can be

made that the present age is far
zmd_.away the most crucial of all.

Many point to the fact that with
the atomic bomb, super techno-

logies, famine and constant war-

fare, man is moving rapidly toward .
self-destruction. But all of these
are paled in significance when one
considers the most dangerous
threat to modern civilization: the
growth of secularism. -

Secularism for our purposes may
be defined as that move away from
religious thought toward a life
devoid _of God and his teachings.
Although this is a world-wide
‘phenomena (one need only look at
the communist slave states and
their enforced atheism), we shall
confine our discussion to the rise of
.secula1‘ism in the United States,
since we are most affected by it.

Until very recently. this country
could truly call itself “one nation
under God," but with the advent of
the 1960s, this title began to have a
hollow ring.
certain forces opposed to religion,
formerly on the lunatic fringe,
began to gain national recognition.

.-Among these was a group
headed ; by» "_Madeline. =Murray
whose‘ shrill‘ cries of
militant atheism became louder
when the national news media took
up the cause. Still, all their
bleatings would have come to

. naught had not the government,‘

under the aegis of the Supreme

-‘ Court, lent its credence to the

anti-God forces by banning all
forms of religious expression in
"public schools. 4

From then on, it has been
downhill all the way. The federal

-courts have been .transformed. into I
a sort. of .. “reverser Inquisition," .

which tiniconjunction with such

‘ unsavory groups as the ACLU has

conspired‘ to destroy ' every -aspect
of American life once -held sacred.

It was then that.

? The Darker Ages  

Birth control was lega1ized,.along
with pornography and foul speech,
not to mentionall sorts of perverse
acts now legal if done by
“consenting adults." .

And time and again, the Court
has refused to aid the ﬁnancially
endangered parochial schools,
SIITCC. their. continued viability
constitutues a major threat to the
Insiders’ New World Order. But
the nadir. of this judicial skull-
duggery was reached in January,
1974, when the court voted 7-2 to
legalize abortions’, i.,e. murder, in a
decision that rivals Dred Scott in
legal and moral incompetence. V

The courts have not been the‘
only instrument for secular change,
however. An even more insidious
battle for our minds is taking place
in the media and in the schools. .
Both newspapers and television
have gone all out in twisting the
truth beyond recognition. In the
news and entertainment fields,
organized religion, especially the
Catholic Church, is portrayed as
the villian in the phony population
explosion, or else ridiculed as on
the shows such as ‘fMaude” or
“All in the Family.”

Now, a movement is underfoot
by O‘Hair et all to have the FCC
ban all religious programmingfrom
radio and TV. Meanwhile. the
schools have ceased to teach of
God, and have substituted in His
place situation ethics and a vague
and insipid humanistic philosophy.
Moreover, Darwin's unproven
theory of evolution is taught as fact

‘alongside amoral sex education

courses, while the Creationist point
of view (as taught in Scripture) is
ridiculed or even forbidden.

Historians often refer to the
medieval times as the Dark Ages,
because of its relative backward-
ness. But the times we are living in
today are far blacker, and unless
we move quickly we any many

.generations to come will be

subjected to a servitude far more
grueling than the serfswof old.

Secularism is like a cancer: Radical
surgery" imay‘ be called. ‘ for to
remove it.‘ . . - .

BY CAL RITCHEY

Newsweek’s September 29 issue
carried at least 10 pages on the
saga of Patty Hearst, a story that
will be quickly forgotten except for
the tedium of the trial, if one
should occur.

Relegated to one column and two
pictures, on page 76 of the same
issue, was a story that may have
greater effect on the American way
of life than any Patty Hearst story.

In April, Karen Ann Quinlan, a
21-year-old New Jerseyite, went
into a deep coma from which she
has not awakened. According to
the Newsweek story, the girl is
being kept alive by a respirator.
Her electroencephalogram pattern
shows only minimal brain-wave
activity, an indication that Quinlan
may already be dead, except for the
spark of “life” being maintained
Presumably, in the
event of -a power failure at the
hospital where she is being
maintained, she would be medic-
ally and legally dead.

But Quinlan is not yet legally
dead. Her parents have asked a
New Jersey Superior Court to give
them “the express power of
authorizing discontinuance of all
extraordinary means of sustaining
(her) vital processes.”

(To make such a request must
have taken many agonizing mo-
ments of introspection for Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph Quinlan, Karen’s
parents. They argue that the girl
is, practically speaking, already
dead.)

The ﬁnal decision of the court--if
it agrees with the Quinlan family
and allows doctors to disconnect
the “life” sustaining respirator»

will have consequences far beyond ‘

the life or death of Karen Quinlan.

‘A decision favorable to the
parents is almost certain to be
appealed by the public defender,_
appointed by the court to represent
Karen’s interests, if indeed she has
any interests in this case. Any such

The PPU’s view

t’ higher quality education.

‘appeal  ably  go  e

Supreme Court. There, a
sustaining ruling could set an
almost unalterable precedent:
once Quinlan is removed from the
respirator, pronounced dead, and
buried, the court’s decision will be
history. There will be no retreat.
Given the possibility of a
sustaining opinion by the Supreme
Court, the case will be used in
arguments for two other hotly
contested right-to-life situations:
the abortion question, and the
legality of capital punishment.
Pro-abortionists will point to the
Quinlan precedent as having direct
bearing onlthe right to abort: if
Quinlan’s ‘_‘life” may be termin-
ated for the beneﬁt of her parents
(and certainly she herself has no
knowledge of the struggle her life
or death has caused), then it
follows that a pregnant woman has
the right to abort" the fetus for the
potential mother’s beneﬁt. .
And again, if Karen’s “life” may

be ermmate , regar ess of the
reason, it follows that a criminal’s
life may be terminated.

The final question in the Quinlan
case probably will not be resolved

for years. Almost certainly, havjrgaﬁ. /
the. =-'

made the initial decision,
Quinlans will carry their case to the
Supreme Court if necessary, just as
the public defender is sure to do.
In the meantime, Karen Quinlan
lies comatose; she may be already
dead, both legally and morally.
And, like her, other people are
being kept alive without their
knowledge or consent, in other
hospitals. , Thousands of women
are denied the right to an abortion,
and theiprisons _are packed with
offenders who in other years would
have been executed long ago.
Perhaps the New Jersey Superior

Court could. help more than Kare I ,
Quinlan, with a speedy aﬁd%r

favorable answerto her parents’
request to be allowed to end her
non-life.

Faculty Union Advantages

BY MARK McC0LLOCH

‘ In recent issues the editors of the
Pitt News have criticized campus
unions and the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) in particular on a
number of issues. This column will
attempt to deal with one of these
issues: the implication that faculty
unionization somehow will hurt
students on this campus, for
example, by increasing tuition. In
fact, given the current situation in
which "the administration wields
nearly total control over decisions
affecting both faculty and students,
the reverse is probably true. On a
number of fronts, a victory by the
PPU will affect students positively.

Tuition: The PPU opposed the
_latest tuition hike. The labor
representative on the Board of
Trustees was the only trustee to
vote against the increase. The
AFL-CIO maintains a powerful
lobby in favor of low tuition and
It does
this because many unionists and/ or
their daughters are students in
institutions such as Pitt.

Class size: The PPU" is opposed
to productivity plans being pushed
by the administration and state
legislature. These plans mean that
fewer and fewer professors will be
teaching larger and larger classes.

Student Participation: On
September 16, the PPU Executive
Council sent a letter to the student
government organizations on cam-
pus. The letter stated part that
representatives , of _ the_ PPU “are
empowered to‘ begin -discussions
with representatives of the student

governments and organizations’

concerning _ the positive’ role of
‘students in collective bargaining.”

No other union has made such a"
» . .~ statement, nor has the. administra..”*

tion._

Educational Quality: Believe it or
not, faculty and graduate employes
do need money to live. Over time,
the low wages paid at Pitt (lower
now than those paid at Slippery
Rock), will lead to a deterioration in
the quality of instruction.
basic PPU position on faculty
salaries is that there be: a) a
standard minimum salary for each
rank, b) an annual cost-of-living
adjustment equal to the change in
the Consumer Price Index, and c)

The -

an annual step increase for all
employes in the bargaining unit.

These are just a few of the
positive aspects of the relationsh' ,_
between PPU and students. T I.
PPU is conﬁdent that the divide-
and-conquer policy followed by the
administration will not succeed in
frustrating the hopes of both

students and faculty for a better

University.

(Mark McColloch is a member of
the PPU.)

A Different View
Of United Nations

The disgusting article I had the
displeasure of reading in the Pitt
News called “Cracks in the UN” by

'Don Mulholland, whose simple

pro-facist mentality could not
phathom that the US could ever be
the bad guy, disturbed me
extremely. Besides his lack of
understanding of international
affairs, as reflected in his state-
ment on the so-called inequities in.
the UN, “The unfair treatment of
Israel, Rhodesia, South Africa and
free China,” his racist, ultra-right,
Birchite ideas of equality surface.
Let’s first of all look at . South
Africa, which was booted out of the
UN General Assembly for its denial
of the human rights of-83% of its
indigenous African population.
The role of the racist South African
minority is enforced by a barbarism

' which can be compared to Hitler’s

regime. South Africa was expelled
from the UN for its racist apartheid
state policy which keeps the
majority of its African population in
slavery; denying them their basic
rights of education, health care,
trade union activity, adequate
housing, family life and participa-
tion in politics. The small minority
that supports South Africa in the
UN are the US, Britain and France
which all have economic ties with
South African government through
big banks and multinational
corporations. These same corpora-
tions that pump billions of dollars
into this apartheid state and
receive up to 22% returns on
investments are the same corpora-
tions that are-responsible for laying
off millions of working people in
this country today.

South Africa is only one example
of the imperialistic adventures of
US ﬁnancial bandits and their state
apparatus. Rhodesia has a similar
system of white apartheid rule that
suppresses its indigenous majority.
The Zionist government of Israel,
with itsexpansionist policies that
are supported to the hilt by the US’
government, economically and
politically, have cried that Arab
terrorism is the reason for
expansion and that the Arab

governments, from the beginning,

have tried to extinguish Israel.

These lies hide the intrigues of
Israeli expansionism and further
penetration of US ﬁnancial expedi-
tions into the Mideast. The
Mideast crisis today as yesterday is
centered around oil and who

  Letters to the Editor

COIlll'()lS itll

Mulholland suggests that it is
communism that has taken over the
UN and his Birchite, racist ideas
conclude that the US government
“Throw the UN out of this
country.” But this ridiculous
assumption is not based on what is
happening in the UN today.
Mulholland is still living in the Cold
War age when the US public was
blinded by anti-communism and
generally misinformed about US
foreign policies, Today not many
working people, students, intellec-
tuals or small businessmen are
fooled by these falsehoods. With
the experiences of Indochina and
the covert activities cjxthe CIA in
Chile, Cuba and presently in
Portugal, we can plainly see that
the US has consistently tried to
manipulate the less developed
countries into its economic and
political stranglehold.

In Chile, billions of dollars were
channeled into the country and
military officers (Chilean) were
trained in this country to overthrow
the democratically elected Salvador
Allende. When the facist Chilean
coup took place, American Navy
troops were posted off the Chilean
shore. Thousands were slaughter-
ed and thrown into concentration
camps and Allende, the Chilean
president, was assasinated. The
US conglomerates--ITT and Ken-
necott Copper-- along with the
military industrial complex in this
country bear particular responsi-
bility for these acts of aggression
against the Chilean people.

In all parts of the world more and
more countries and their peoples
are seeing the true aggressor as US
multinational imperialists. The
change in the UN reflects the
change of the balance of power in
the world away from the policies of
imperialist aggression towards
policies of peaceful coexistence.

In conclusion let me say that I am
for freedom but when Mulholland
openly writes approval of racist US

is relative, because the ideas that
Mulholland expouses attempt to
legitimize the denial of the

condemn these ideas as racist and

Facts on Smoke
And Non-Smokers‘

In response to what seems to be
a pressing issue, the Medical
Action Committee has set up a
subcommittee on Smokers’ and
Nonsmokers’ Rights. In that
smoking in classrooms seems to
bother a number of nonsmokers for
medical reasons, or that it is simply
an annoyance, we have investi-
gated the law behind the “No
Smoking” signs posted in all of the
classrooms. City Order 210, Article
Numbﬁr 34, states that there is to
be smoking in any part of any
school by anyone at anytime. Yet
special smoking facilities may be
provided for teachers. We were
informed that Pitt, even though a
university, is classiﬁed as a school
in this case. I he city enforces this
law by having one of their ten ﬁre

inspectors respond to a complaint.
Then if the inspector ﬁnds someone
in a classroom smoking, the
professor or the dean of the school
is given a liability receipt. The
professor or dean then goes to
court, and if they are found guilty,
a ﬁne of $300 per each day
someone is found smoking is
levied.

Not only does smoking annoy
many non-smokers, and it is
against the law, The American
Lung Association has published a
leaﬂet stating “The Facts for
N0nSm0k8l'S-’° Consider some of
the facts: ~

--Inhaling second-hand smoke
makes the heart beat faster, the
blood pressure go up and the level
of carbon monoxide in the blood
increase. -

--There is more cadmium in th
smoke that drifts off the burning
end of the cigarette than in the
drag the smoker takes. Large
doses of cadmium have been
related to hypertension, chronic
emphysema.

--The amount of carbon monox-
ide in the blood of nonsmokers
.doubles in a poorly. ventilated room
ﬁlled with cigarette smoke. Even
outside the room, the , inhaled‘
carbon monoxide stays in the body
for three or four hours.‘

--The nonsmoker is forced to
breathe in smoke from the burning
end of the cigarette as well as the
smoke exhaled by the smoker.

--An estimated two million
Americans are sensitive to tobacco
smoke and suffer smoke-caused
asthma attacks.

This clearly indicates that
nonsmokers are subjected to
hazards similar to that of‘ a
cigarette smoker. Therefore, in
view of the legal and medical
implications, doesn’t it make sense
to follow the advice of ’the“‘No

Smoking” signs and prohibit‘

smoking in the classrooms?

I Variation of Themes

BY PAMELA EUSI

If your tastes in the world of
music happen to include piano, you
might have been sitting in on an
excellent concert Tuesday night in
‘the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.
Pianist William Doppmann pres-
ented a program of sensitive and
interesting compositions.

Andante * con varlazioni and
Fantasia in C by Haydn were two
short pieces establishing Dopp-
mann’s style and skill.

Andante began with a slow,
simple theme. The variations came
later. A number of trills and
cross-hand motions dominated the

Fantasia sounded remnants of
Bach’s baroque style. Intricate
'tlgurish_es and the simultaneous

playing of two separate themes
kept the piece moving.

The next work dealt with the
King Arthur legends. Sonata No. 2
in G minor, Opus 50 by Edward
MacDowell employed four move-
ments pertaining to four famous
elements of the legend. V

A royal setting captured the

- ﬂavor of King Arthur’s court and

his notorious Round Table in the
ﬁrst movement. All sorts of sound
mixtures displayed the gamut of
possible emotions in this scene.

Examples include fast, stormy

technique, eyil, villain-like, sneaky '

themes; gracious, tender motifs;
and a majestic ﬁnal theme in lower

the comedic aspects of Merlin, the
wizard in mischievous and daring
passages. The third movement
was devoted to Guinevere with all
the passion and pure emotion
available to the composer.
MacDowell could not resist
writing a death scene and so the

« Boys Behind ‘Jazz’ Man

BY MICHAEL COHEN

Don’t be misled by the Market
Square area where the nightclub is
situated.-. You might have to wade
through a gang of dirty pigeons.
The glaring marquee, “WALT
HARPER LIVE AT THE ATTIC,”
stands as a tribute to the man.
Once through the glass door you've
escaped into the web of Walt
Harper's Attic. No one else exists
as dynamic and personable as the
man. His brash piano is heard
overcoming the rain.

A large placard with a blown-up
newspaper interview of Walt greets
you.

“How can you entertain every
night of the week and remain in
business? What attracts people to

enough to keep up with the
contemporary scene. I even do a
Seals and Crofts number.” .

On the wall to the far left,
beneath photos of Duke Ellington
and Satchmo, a glaring Walt
Harper is shown shaking hands
with Mayor Pete Flaherty. Other

stage. Each ﬁnds his spot under
the dim red, blue and green lights.
For the next 40 minutes you listen
to soothing, sometimes rocking
jazz. Harper at the piano
dominates. His Cheshire Cat smile
remains steadfast. The music is
flawless and appears well rehear-
sed, as the musicians ﬂow from one
number to another. Occasionally
the saxophone, flute and bass are
given freedom to move. But
everything begins and ends with
Harper’s piano.

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

Duke University is located in one .

of the most beautiful areas of the
country, the rollillg hills of North
Carolina. Its academic standards
are among the highest in the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation (NCAA), 90% of its faculty
has doctorate degrees and 90%--
90”/2--of its football team
graduates, a rarity in these days of
so many football factories from
sea to shining sea.

With such an academic reputa-
tion to live up to, it should be a
wonder Duke even fields a_ football
team, right? '

The truth now can be told: the
Duke Blue Devils indeed are
ﬁelding a football team, and a
pretty good one at that.

“The people from Duke feel this
is the best team they’ve had in
years,” said Head Coach Johnny
Majors. “This game will be a real
test for us.” -

Basically it's hard to classify the
Blue Devils as a running or
throwing team; they can do both
with about equal capability.

Their quarterback is 6-2, 190-
pound senior Bob Corbett, who
took over the QB job last week
against arch-rival Virginia and led
the Devils to their first victory of
the year, 26.-11.

“Corbett is deﬁnitely an impres-
sive passer,” said Pitt defensive
backﬁeld Coach Joe Madden. “So
far he has completed 54% of his
passes. This will be the best

throwing team. we have faced so_

far."

BY YAIER 

The word going around nowa-
days is Danny Murtaugh must be a
miracle worker to have led his team
to the Eastern Division title. The
fact is, though, with the talent on
the Pirate team, Bozo the Clown
could have managed and the Bucs
still would have won the title.

‘The Pirates will have to call on
every bit of the aforementioned
talent they can ‘muster to beat the
Big Red Machine when they open
the N ational League Championship
Series in Cincinnati tomorrow.

One of the most important things
in the Pirates’ favor at the moment
is they will not exactly be facing the
toughest pitching staff in the
league. Last year’s ace at
Cincinnati, Jack Billingham, has
been bombed worse than Dresden
was in World War II. The Buc
sluggers will have to get to the "Red
pitching early, though, or it will be
a very short series, with the Reds
on top.

It should be no problem for
National League slugging leader
Dave Parker, Willie Stargell,
Richie Zisk and just about anyone,
except for Frank Taveras, to get to
the Red pitching. They’ve done it
to better pitchers.

The only question is, can the
Pirates stop —Johnny Bench and
Company from doing the "same?

The Pirate pitching certainly is
up to the task. Jerry Reuss, Jim
Rooker and John Candelaria will
get the calls to «start the first three
games of the playoffs. Reuss is
having his best season ever, while
Rooker has been a model of
constancy and has a low ERA. _

‘ Rookie Candelaria is facing a
tough situation. He has been very
strong during the season, but
starting a playoff game is another
thing altogether. Then again,
Bruce Kison did it as a rookie in
1971, helping the Bucs stage -a
come-from -behind World Series
win over the Baltimore Orioles.

The —7Pirate pitching staff is
second- in -the league in «five
departments, including«ERA. .» The

Buc ERA is 3.01, due largely to ‘

Larry-‘Demery, Ramon Hernandez,

 

‘Chief targets for Corbett are
wide receiver Larry Upshaw, who
has caught seven passes for 121
yards, and split end Troy Slade,
who has caught 10 pigskins for 156
yards. But his credentials don’t
stop there.

Slade also runs back punts and
kickoffs and, for good measure, he
runs the ball occasionally. He's
sort of an all-round player.

“Slade has good speed and is
also a very ﬁne downﬁeld blocker,”
said his coach, Mike McGee.

The" Blue Devils’ biggest plus is
their talent and depth at running
back. I

Leading the pack is tailback Art
Gore, who has 128 yards on 28
carries. Unfortunately, or fortu-
nately, depending on your outlook,
Gore severely injured his ankle
against Virginia and is listed as
doubtful for the game.

Behind Gore is Pittsburgher
Tony Benjamin, who played his
high-school ball at nearby Mones-
sen. The “Monessen Greyhound,”

as he is known, is third in rushing
for the Blue Devils, with 82 yards,
averaging over four yards per
crack.

The tailback position for Duke
features Larry Martinez, a senior at
200 pounds, averaging 4.4 yards a
carry.

Behind Martinez comes a guy
with a name familiar to anyone who
has followed college ball over the
past ﬁve years--Pruitt. No, Greg
hasn’t decided to return to the
classroom, it's only his cousin Rob,
but he isn’t a bad man for backing
up the front lines.

Pitchingversus

‘not pitched well at all in the latter
half of the season. ,
This pitching staff will have to

‘stop one of the most _awesome

aggregations of power ever. Some
- have tried to compare these Reds to
the 1927 Yankees, who sported the
likes of Musial, Ruth, Gehrig,
Lazerri and Coombs, and although
the Reds do not compare with the
sluggers of old, they still have
Bench, Perez,“ Morgan, Foster,
Geronimo and Rose. '
To stop these sluggers, it will
take not only pitching, but also
defense. Defense is a sore spot on
the Pirate team, especially on the
left side of the inﬁeld, where
Taveras and Richie Hebner are
erratic at best. i
The outfield has its problems,
too. Al Oliver has to cover a lot
more ground than a centerfielder

Defensively the task

took over the reins, Duke ranked
either first or second in defense_for
the Atlantic Coast Conference.

This year however, graduation
has left a seemingly big hole in the
Blue Devils. Bright spots do exist.
At the linebacker position, Dave
Meier and Ernie Clark are rated
excellent, and free safety Laniel
Crawford is considered by Panther
coaches as a “good one.”

-yards and could become “crucial,”

as Majors is so fond of saying.

“This is an even game going into
game day," Majors said. “Duke is
impressive both offensively and
defensively, with their defense
giving us additional problems
because they use three different
defenses (the 4-3, 50 and 60
defenses). This game could go
either way." ~

Despite their academic stand-
ards, the Blue Devils have shown
they can take care of themselves in
the cruel world of college football.

The Panthers had better beware.

Power  

normally should. Zisk cannot get to
a lot of balls not hit right at‘ him, so

« Oliver has to make up for some

ground. Parker has plenty of speed
but is only adequate in the ﬁelding
department.

The Cincinnati defense is much
more solid, with a solid double play
combination of D,aveg:,Concepcion
and Joe Morgan. T_hir",d,base.could
be a weakness with "Pete Rose’s
inexperience at the position. '

The outﬁeld is not much better
than that "of the Pirates, with the
only difference possibly being the
strong arm of Cesar Geronimo in
right ﬁeld. .

The whole story of this series is
Pirate pitching and offense vs.
Cincinnati offense and defense. On
the basis of stronger pitching,
Pittsburgh should win it" in ﬁve
high-scoring games.

  Harriers Venture To  
Ashland Invitational

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt cross-country team will

journey west to the Ashland-

Invitational today. The rolling
ﬁve-mile course will be the next
stepping stone toward the climax of
the season. After a sound win in
their opener, Coach Agostinella’s
harriers are ready to take on .10 of
Ohio’s better college teams, plus
the University of Western.Ontario.

“When you have a group of guys
who were front runners in high
school, they have something to
learn about college running,”
Agostinella said. “If they can run
as a group like at Cal State, they
will do well. ’

' “By running as‘ a pack,‘the team

“accomplishes two"things; ﬁrst,

Herrmann. “Instead of four or ﬁve
good runners, we have twice that
number this year. Our enthusiasm
is also high. Evervone helps the
other guys and keeps them up for

Each meet is very important for
two reasons, according to Agostin-
ella. - ' J »

“First, we have to do well in
every meet since the only way
independents such as Pitt can
qualify for nationals is to be in peak
form all the time. And second, to

Panther Cubs Visitpi
Potomac State 1 1  

BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

Excedrin headache #47, the JV
football coach. What can Larry
Holton look forward to when his
0-0-1 Panther Cubs travel to
Potomac State (2-0) for their Friday
night contest?

“This could be a complete
disaster,” said Holton of the
upcoming game. “Our entire team
is made up mostly of walk-ons.
“We’re very green, and Potomac
State has a decent squad. It’s
going to beea tough game for us to
win.”

This year’s squad will be

(5-11, 165) from Brooklyn, N.Y.
His passes will be directed toward
the-_sure hands of Ken Dapp, a
Newcumberland, Pa., sophomore.
Both of these offensive stars are
walk-on players. 

“This year’s - team has little
experience behind it, not like in
past seasons, when we had a lot of
good scholarship talent,” Holton
said. “Our saving grace this year
will have to lie with our linemen,
where most of the scholarship
players are centered.

“Dave Logan and Ed Gallagher
have been doing a good job for us
in the trenches this year. I have to
give all these kids a lot of praise.
They’ve been working hard, and
their desire to play isn’t dampened
by the fact that most of them
aren’t getting anything out of this

»except the thrill of playing

football.”

What does Holton expect from
Potomoc State? “They use the
basic pro-set offense, which means

Pantherettes, to Penn St. a

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

It is Year Two in the reign of the
Pantherettes, and volleyball teams
everywhere are steadying their
serves and tying their shinguards
in hopes of an upset. Last year, for
its debut, the Pitt team compiled a
14-3 re'cor.d and there is‘ every
indication it will improve even on
that. ‘ _

“We’re basically young, we’re
well-coordinated and we’re work-'
ing very hard,” said Head Coach
Mary Kromer. “The team has a
tremendously positive attitude.

“With a year’s experience,
they're more consistent. We have
more power hitters and more
depth, deﬁnitely more depth,”
Kromer said.

“This year, every person on the
team has the talent_and the skill,
where last year we were just
learning,” added 1974 MVP Jamie
Andrews.

The Pantherettes will open the

7 Temp|e—Best Defense ls

BY JIM LEWIS

It’s like a soap opera.

In last Saturday’s thrilling
episode, the Pitt Soccer team--the
young, struggling, up-and-coming
youngster--beat a rough, sneaky,
slippery Edinboro soccer team, the
‘Simon Legree of local soccer, and
therefore made life worth living for

' . Pitt Soccer Coach Leo Bemis.

But, just as the deﬂated Scots

A. left Pitt Stadium, bagpipes drag-

’ ging behind them, in walks another
‘~ ' seemingly unbeatable foe, the
 gTemple Owls. They threaten the
 A Panthers with an ominous 10-3-1
—record from last year and an
‘ ‘opening 2-0 victory over East
- Stroudsburg last week.

Can the youngster defeat this

new villain and raise his record to .
4-1-1?

Can he win a second time in front
of a pre-football game crowd, or
will he fall into the hands of this
treacherous ne'er-do-well?

Is there sex after death?

These and other fascinating
questions will be answered tomor-
row when Pitt hosts Temple in
another one of those pregame
soccer matches. Gate 7.will be
open for students at 10 am. Your
football ticket entitles you to
admission.)

The Temple game should prove
interesting. Here are two
extremely similar teams, both of
which have growing offenses,
sturdy defenses and hopes of
getting a bid for the NCAA

Championship Tournament. And a
win for either Temple or Pitt might
be the edge that will enable one
team to be in the championships at
the end of the season while the
other patches deflated soccer balls.

For that reason‘, there is no doubt
tomorrow’s game will be a battle to
the end.

“Temple is the best team we will
have played to date,” Bemis
stated. “It has exceptional
talent.” .

Not only does it have exceptional
talent, but experienced talent as
well. The Owls have eight of 11
starters returning from last year’s
team, including forwards Joe
DiSalvo, their high scorer with 11
goals and an East Coast Confer-
ence All-Star.

Also joining. the Owls this year
will be John Sullivan, a freshman
who was top scorer on the United
German Hungarian soccer club in
Major Division “A,’-’ one of the top
leagues in Philadelphia.

Plus, Temple has a defense that
gave up only 15 goals in 14 games
last year. That, as all you math
majors know, is an average of 1.06
goals a game.

But the Panthers counter with
some pretty good statistics of their
own. The Pitt offense, the biggest
question mark on the team at the
start of the season, is coming alive.

“We’re starting to generate
good offense,” Bemis said. “Our
passwork was real good in the last
couple games.”

Pitt has the offense able to break

Offense

open Temple’s stubborn defense.
While the Owls threaten with an
offense that scored 31 goals last
year, the Panthers counter with
their explosive offense, led by
center Al Jutca, whose four goals in
ﬁve games is tops on the team.
Forward John Morahan is right
behind with two goals so far. Also
contributing to the Panther scoring
cause are Tom Murphy, Mark
Nigh, John Curley and Bob
Graham, each with one goal.

Injuries are beginning to plague
the Panther offense, though. The
one bright spot on the injury report
is the return of Mark Nigh, who
injured his leg in the Bucknell
game.

The one dark. spot on the report
is the chance that Curley may be
lost for at least the Temple game
because of a suspected broken toe.

“Curley was playing good ball.

Jay is proﬁcient in a variety of
styles. His favorite form curves out
from the bottom, stops at a point
and ﬂares out with a concave line.
A number of large bowls, casserole
pots and hanging planters are done
in this style. ‘

Only one piece is done in the
elongated bubble form. This vase
stretches gracefully upward, ex-
panding into a bubble near the top,
which is tightly collared by a high
rim. Jay swirls the top with a blue
comb design dramatically slashing
down the length of the piece. It is a
superb demonstration of J ay’s
control. and -conﬁdence with clay.

He exhibits two ﬁnely done
porcelain tea bowls. Once again he
shows great harmony with his
medium. The forms are light,
graceful curves, and soft, clear
glazes. '

Among potters, clay is seen as a
mystical being. Clay is a god--both

With Jay’s demonstrated ability
to concentrate and his sensitivity to
form, beautiful pots should
emerge.‘ Instead, the rest of the

bulkiness and shoddiness. '

Also exhibited are three large

A beautifully glazed coffee set is
