The petition stated that parking meters would be unfeasible
and create an additional parking problem for daytime students
Over 1,500 people signed the petition;
Bijur and Tom Olofson, past president‘ of Student Government,
presented the petition to City Council. ‘

In its ﬁnal form the petition wanted students to have per-
mission to park for any length of time in the metered area at ~
rates one-half as high as those proposed by the City Council.

The petition was rejected. "‘We could have had 10,000.

made any difference.”

According to Mr. A. S.» Miscemarra, trafﬁc engineer, the
meters will provide additional parking spaces for University
students because it will eliminate all day parking and create
a greater -turnover in parking spaces.

There will be one, two and four hour meters. A change
in’ the type of meter that will be installed has delayed the com-
pletion of the project. until late June. . _

By N ancx’ “elaney

As part of the University’s pro-
gram to encourage older women
to continue or update their edu-
cation, an all-day seminar on the
“New Horizons for Women” is
being held on campus today. The
seminar is open to any women
interested in attending.

The program is aimed at help-
lng the Pittsburgh area to better
utilize the talents of its women.
A build_-up of qualiﬁed women
should entice research laborato-
ries and industries to settle in

Pittsburgh, which would bolster

the area’s economy, explained
Mrs. Hibbard Kline, new co-

ordinator of the University’s wo-
men’s advanced, study program.

The ﬁrst speaker for the morn-
ing session was Mrs. Esther Peter-
son, Assistant Secretary of Labor
and Consumer Counsel to Presi-
dent Johnson. Mrs. Peterson spoke
about “The Changing Status of
Women."

“Who Needs Women?"
Mrs. Peterson was followed by
Dr. Ruth Useem. Research Con-

Publications
Request Raise
ln Allowances

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Student Publications have sub-
mitted their requests for budget
increases for the school year be-
ginning‘ September, 1964. All ﬁve
publications, The Pitt News, The
Owl, The Skyscraper Engineer,
The Pitt Capsule, and Ideas and
Figures have asked for increases.

The Publications have asked
for a total increase of $3,785,
$1,500 to the News, $500 to the
Owl, $700 to the Skyscraper, The
Capsule, $350, and Ideas and
Figures, $435.

According to Director. of. Stu-
dent Publications, Irving Roth-
man, the publication are asking
for the funds to “expand and meet
the increased demands of the res-
ident students.” ‘

“Without the budget increase.”
Rothman continued, the Pub-

lications might have to cut back A

from their current schedules.”

According to Rothman, the
budget demands are not excessive,
but a bare minimum of what is
needed. The News wants money
to increase its publishing schedule
to three times per week. The Sky-

_ scraper wants money to publish

six times a year rather than ﬁve.

*They had published six times a

year in 1960, but had to cut
back the next’ year to ﬁve.
Ideas and Figures wants to in-
sure twice a year publication,

The News needs. their budget

ber of the Publications Board,

The Hill Education P r oj e c t
(HEP) will maintain abooth on
the ground ﬂoor of the CL. today
through Friday to recruit, Uni-

versity students for two projects
and to answer questions, Irv Gar-
ﬁnkel, co-ordinator of HEP an-
nounced.

Firstof the programs is that
of tutoring -high schools students
for two to four hours a week at
Heldman Centre. Hep needs 100
such tutors, for the program since
many tutors will not be. here

number of tutees will remain the
same, Garﬁnkle explained.

The other project is to serve
as counselors for athletic games

Both the "academic disciplines '

Certain undergraduate courses
in the School of Liberal Arts _will
be revised to place greater stress
on aspects of knowledge which
are not conﬁned to particular cul-

new courses to ﬁll the gap in the ~

University’s present international

During the past eight years, the
University has increased the num-
ber of foreign students studying
on campus. The Ford grant will
promote the establishment of an
English Language Institute, which
will offer intensive training in
English as a -second language for
foreign students. The Language
Institute program will be taught
differently than a regular English
course. In addition, it will give
instruction to teachers going
abroad, in teaching English as a
second language. A

The programs made possible by
the grant rare in keeping with
Chancellor Litchﬁeld's 1962 com-
mencement remarks when he said
that “there is a concensus that a

Pitt Book Store

Now Showing
Hungarian Art

Woodcuts by Joseph Domjan
are now on display in the Fine
Arts Book Room in the Book

Store.

' The folk art of Domjan’s native
Hungary, his work" reflects the
imagery of peasant men and W0-
men, plants, flowers, birds, and
other forms of nature. '

The woodcuts are rich and
luminous in color. Domjan’s uni_
qu_e way of handling them ac-
counts for their brilliancy.

Prepare Woodcuts’

In making a woodcut, after
carving the block, he seals the
surface with a coat of shellac,
then applies an ink he has made
himself. The ink is composed. of
poppy seed oil, French turpen_
tine, linseed oil and lavender oil.‘
This is mixed with the dry pig-

ment and applied with a flat’

brush.
In Dfinting, he transfers the
image to the paper with just
the pressure of his thumb. This
process keeps‘ the color resting
gently on the surface, and gives
the effect of great luminosity.
The many layers of color are
produced by huccessively print-C
ing the many blocks he has
made for each print, often as
many as eight or ten blocks.
Domjan’s art shows great joy
and enthusiasm for life and free-
dom, qualities that are closely
allied with his own life.

 Editorial: Publications In The Poorlmuse

With their eye on the September tuition raise, Student Publications
Business Managers have applied for their share of the increased Univer-
sity funds. And rightfully so.

V, When the University “slashed publication appropriations in 1960-
1961, the total setback was 17 per cent. As a result the ﬁve organizations
scrambled to keep their heads above water through their own incomes,
but the rising production costs were too much for them.

The cut forced the Skyscraper Engineer from six issues a year to ﬁve.
Ideas and Figures could no longer insure twice a year publication. Only
Pitt News expanded from two to three times a week on the basis of its
own advertising, but with the withdrawal of cigarette advertising last
summer, the average number of pages per issue decreased in relation to
the expanded schedule.

According to Irving Rothman, Director of Student Publications this
increase in appropriations is essential ifpublications are to expand to
meet the needs of the students. He cites the demands as not excessive,
but a bare minimum of what is needed.

The business_managers are asking only to insure the frequency
and the quality of their publications. Nothing more. The Skyscraper

wants to regain its status of four years ago. Ideas and Figures wants
to make sure it can come out twice-a year. The Pitt News wants to
maintain its thrice-weekly schedule.

Last trimester Director of Education Planning Dr. Carl E. Wedekind _

authorized a $1000 appropriation to The'Pitt News to insure biweekly
publication during the spring trimester. He striplated that $150 of this
would go for monthly _Skyscraper supplements within the newspaper to
further strengthen the area.

Dr. Wedekind has recognized Student Publications as one of the
most important student forces on campus. He has also seen that they
cannot maintain publication without ‘additional funds when publication
costs are up 25 per cent since 1961 and appropriations were cut 17 per cent
in that same year.

We would hope that this indication of administrative interest in
promoting the spring term by strengthening itsstudent programs doesn’t
wilt with the_A_ugust heat. The proposed budgets’ are legitimate requests
to mai_ntain publications worthyof the University. "Without the increase
they cannot; I ‘A * '

Letters Ot Reference . . .

 

Each year hundreds of graduating
seniors scurry from professor to professor
and back again with varied requests for
letters of references to be sent to inquistive
graduate schools throughout the nation.

I Nowadays no graduate. application is com-
plete without a complex list" of interests,
abilities, accomplishments, and other such
da-ta.

tain student in his class three times a week

for one or two terms, most graduate schools
consider him superbly qualiﬁed to talk
’ about that student’s qualiﬁcations for grad-
uate study. A reasonable assumption or
not, the student almost always ﬁnds him-
self going to one or more of his professors
-for such a reference. ' ‘ "

Of course, having taken so~ many
courses from so many different professors
at student has his pick of possibilities to ask.
What happens, however, when he makes a

fessor out of a: hundred who can’t stand
him? What happens when a professor sends

. a derogatory letter of reference to a grad-
uate school and the college of his choice
rejects the student because of such a letter?
What resource does a-student have in such
‘a situation? How does he ever know when
such a letter has been sent out? What can
he do about refuting the letter? ,

The answer to all these questions is,
unfortunately, contrary to the interests
of th e student applying for graduate

" study. He knows nothing and therefore

In reality, he squeaked in through the
back door. , “ _
Perhaps it might be unfair to profes-
sors who are asked to write‘ letters of
. reference to be required to submit carbon
copies to the students. This would al-
most be an admission on the part of the
professor that he cannot quite be trusted.
Most probably, they would refuse to write
any letters of reference should such a
policy be instituted. ‘

The question here_'is not one of the stu-
dent’s qualiﬁcation for graduate school._ If
a professor does not feel that-a student is
capable of higher academic [work then, he
should say so in a letter of reference,'or
simply. ‘refuse to write the letter -entirely."
The point‘ in question is that a student,
should at least know where he sta'r'1ds."He‘
should be able to defend himself in the
event of a derogatory letter of ‘reference. »
He should know that a particular profes-
sor thinks that he is iunqualiﬁed.

.Perhaps the best move would be to re-
quire the professor to place’ a copy of the
letter of reference on" ﬁle so that a student
would be able to look at it ‘if he desired.
This would place the initiative in the hands
of the student. If the student checked up.
on the professor, he would be admitting
that he did not trust the professor to be

professor of the requirement of submit-

The easiest I solution, of course, is for

to even partially understand the role of citizen action in
bringing about social change in our modern society.

jail —- and other, often physical abuses —— to dramatize
the injustice of discriminatory practices. “Much of 1 the
leadership of this movement, both North and South, has
come from the university campus — students, faculty,
and staff. It is only natural that young people of intel-

social change and assume a leadership role in bringing
it home. -

You also fail to perceive the relationship of demon-
strations of the type in which Miss Kellams was in-

eﬂicient the Commission may be in doingsits job, it is

. constrained by extremely complex and slow-moving

legal procedures. Non-violent demonstrations and

similar actions both supplement and. give community

support to the activities of the Commission. The two

approaches are complementary means of achieving
‘ the same goal.

A ﬁnal point — the position of the University in

support of equal opportunities for the Negro has been ’

made amply clear by the policy statements and actions
on the part of the Chancellor, the faculty, and the stu-

it Mitters Lose Three Straight;

. Battle Allegheny Tomorrow

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

L Allegheny College’s baseball team visits the Panthers tomorrow in Bobby Lewis’s
home opener in Forbes Field. It will be the ﬁrst game the Panthers have played in Oak-
land in two years. Lewis is looking- forward to tomorrow’s game, hoping it will break the

Panthers’ three game losing streak.-Lewis will pitch Roger Johnson against the Gators.

This past weekend, the Pan-
thers dropped three games on
an Eastern trip. Friday they
lost to Cornell, 5-4. Saturday
they dropped a doubleheader
to Syracuse, losing the ﬁrst
game, 2-0, on a one-hitter by
Glenn Borkhuis. They lost the-
second game, 5-4.

Dave Blyshak pitched the

ﬁrst game of the doubleheader,
and according to Lewis, pitched
well enough to win. “Two runs
usually isn’t good enough to win
a ball game,” Lewis said. “It’s
unfortunate that it was good
enough to beat us.”

The Panthers‘ only hit in the
game was
Yedlicka, who hit a ground ball
single over second base in the
second inning. The Panthers
never mounted a serious scoring
threat in the ball game. “We
were never really in it,” Lewis
said, “That kid (Borkhuis over-
powered us.”

Although not overpowered in
the second game, the Panthers
were still unable to gain a win,
although they led_by 3-2 in the
seventh inning of the game.

The Panthers scored two runs

“in the sixth ' inning when
George Prussin walked with the

ed to bring in the winning run.

The Panthers lost to Cornell
Friday in spite of a home run

and three-runs batted in by

Mazurek. The two, three. four,
and ﬁve batters collected all
eight hits in the Panthers’ losing
cause. Bryan Fisher had two
singles, Mazurek aisingle and a

bases loaded to force home'Yed-
licka. The second run of the
inning came on Tim Grgurich’s
sacriﬁce fly. '

-The Panthers went ahead in
-the seventh inning when Fred
Mazurek singled, moved the
third on a-sacriﬁce hunt, and
scored. when Yedlicka singled.

The Orange tied the game in
the bottom of the seventh off
starter Dave Sauer, who was’
relieved by Andy Alex. Alex
gave up an intentional walk,»
and was ‘then. relieved by Lee
Brueckel. Brueckel threw a
wild pitch with the bases load-

home run, Dave Reichenbach a
single, and Tim Grgurich a
double and two singles.

Roger Johnson strated the
game, but was relieved by
Brueckel in the ﬁfth inning,
when Cornell scored their win-
ning runs.

Despite his team's 3-4 record,
Lewis is not discouraged. “This
club will come along,” Lewis
said. “We. just haven’t -been
putting our hits together, and
a couple of hits in the right
places would see us undefeated
now. We’ve lost three one run
games, and a two run game.”

Golfers Lose
Seventh Match

The Panther golf team lost

three more matches this weekend
to make their season record, 0-7.
The Panthers were beaten by
Virginia, 141/2-131/g, at Chartiers
Country Club Saturday, and came
in third in a triangular meet
against Kent State and Toledo at
Kent, Ohio, Saturday.
’ Ray McIntosh was the only
Panther to score less than his op-
ponent against West Virginia as
he posted an 83 compared to
Jim Smith’s 87.

The Panthers were badly beat-
en by Toledo, 21-3, but made it a
little closer against Kent State,
15]/2-8.1/g. Phil Fasset was the
standout for the Panthers as he
shot a 71. This tied him for meda-
list honors with Bill Buss and
Denny Spencer of Toledo. Rich
McBride was the only other Pan-
ther who scored better than his
opponent in the triangular meet.
Fassett was also the Panthers
top scorer against West Virginia
with a 77.

Opening Matches
Prove Disastrous

For Tennis Team
Coach Ben Pope’s Panther ten-

feated in its opening matches this
weekend. The Panthers lost at
Navy, 9-0, Fridayand at George-
town by the same score Saturday.
The shutouts didn’t begin to
tell how badly the Panthers lost.
Against Navy the Panthers won
only ten games to the Middies
72 in singles play and in doubles
it was worse as Navy won 36
games to two for the visitors.
Georgetown won _72 singles
games against ten for the Pan-
thers Saturday, but in doubles
play against Hoyas the Panthers

weekend. The duo of Adrian
Hartman and Dave Orth actually
won a set. They were beaten by
Lee Vandercarr and Dick Hanford,
6-4, 5-7, 6-2. The Panthers’ other
two doubles teams could only win

eight games.

Lewis then explained his
team is travel-weary. .He says
playing the next‘ four games
in Forbes F/ieldshould give his
team the edge they need to win
the close games.

“This team can still win
games.” the coach said. “We’ve
been hitting the ball, but it's

always right at somebody. If we ‘
keep hitting ’ the ball, theyfll.

start falling in.”

The play of the -team other-_- ,
wise has been good, according-

to Lewis, mut not quite good
enough to compensate for his
his team’s hitting deﬁciency. ‘‘I

feel sorry for the pitchers,”
“They’ve pitched‘

any game. Blyshak has been
pitching well, and so have
Sauer and Johnson . . . and we
haven’t had many errors by

Lewis thinks his team can
start a winning streak tomorrow

‘ against Allegheny. ‘‘We’ll beat

them tomorrow,” he said.

 

Entered in College Division

Track Team Place
Well in PennRelays

By HOWARD AINISMAN

The Panther track team took a ﬁrst, two seconds, and a
fourth in the Penn Relays last weekend. The ﬁrst and two
seconds, however, were accomplished in the college division

of the relays.

The relays are divided into two sections ,—‘- the all-American
and the college. Theindividuali or teams with the best time trials
go into the all-American division. The remaining teams are in the
college division.

The Panthers winning time in
the 880-yard relay was 1:27. Joe
Friend, Mike Slu_tsky, Bill Del-
.Vecchio, and Dick Crout scored
the triumph for the Panthers.

 

In the sprint relay the Pan-
thers ﬁnished a close second

__to Holy Cross. They had been
‘leading from the beginning of

the race, but were nipped at
the tape by Holy Cross. The

,medlay relay consists of a

quarter mile, two 220-yard
dashes, and a half mile. Crout
and DelVecchio ran the 2205 for‘
the Panthers, Bob Buell did the
440, and Don Henchberger the
half mile.

Although they failed to .make

the ,all—American division the
sprint medley relay team’s. time
"was the third best in the entire
tournament,
Carl Rees. It was"a case of-the
Panthers ,-not doing well in- the
qualifying, but coming on strong
in the ﬁnals. , I
Al Thomassey took a second in
the college division discus throw

according to coach

Rees said that if Thomassey had

qualiﬁed for the all-American ,

division he would have taken a
third in that event since the only
throw in the all-American Idi-
vision that was better than the
top two throws in the college di-
vision was the winning one.
Hurdler Joe Friend. was the
only Panther: who was not in.
the college division. Friend had

L . Football Team Ends Drills
Lucas, Howley Star
In Intra-Squad Game‘

The footballteam ended is spring practice on April
18th as the Blue squad defeated the Whites, 22-6, in the
annual intra-squad game. The Blues had a natural ad-
vantage because they had 14 lettermen and the Whites
had only four.

Bill Howley, a senior and a two-year letterman, led the Blues
as he scored the game’s initial touchdown in the second quarter
on a 14-yard pass from Ken Lucas. Howley accounted for an-
other Blue touchdown with a 95-yard.kickoff return in the fourth
quarter. On that run, Bernie LaQuinta, Barry McKnight and
Paul Cercel led the interference. ’

Lucas piloted the Blues for most of the game and completed
two touchdown passes. Besides the second-quarter pass to
Howley, he hit Dale Stewart with a six-yard TD aerial in the
third quarter. 1

Despite the fact that the Whites only scored‘ once, the team

made"a decent showing, since it had 15 sophomores and only four <

lettermen. Ed Assid scored the touchdown on a six-yard sweep

around right end. Thequarterbacking chores were divided among -
_Assid, Pete Smith and Tippy Pohl throughout the game. Smith

gave the best showing of the three, as Pohl tumbled the ball and
had a pass intercepted. ~

The standout for the Whites, however, was Jim Flanigan.
The bruising sophomore from West-Miﬂ‘lin North thrilled the
sparse crowd with his driving runs. Flanigan was the work horse
of ‘the team, and broke away twice for runs of 15 and_ 13 yards.
