t"PinbaII Machines Roll Back

mew

BY THOMAS PETRISKO

Towers pinball machines are
temporarily back in the main lobby
as a result of an agreement
between the Resident Student
Association (RSA), and the Office
of Student Affairs.

Threepinball machines are now
in their former position, after being
moved from the inner lobbies of the
Towers where they were placed last
Dctobcr 25.

The decision to move them back
was reached in ameeting between
RSA Chairman Marty Doeﬂer and
Director of Residence Life, Fred
Fonseca. Doefler contended that
the machines still were making too
much noise in whichever area they

‘were situated. '

“The decision to move them

_back was a temporary compromise

  Faculty Union Forces Y F
Gearing Election Drive

ff-,,

.. ./

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

While _most of us will be
frolicking in the snow over the
Christmas break, there are many
on campus who will be working
overtime, in particular the heads of
the faculty unions struggling to
lock up the University and the
University's labor lawyers.

Sometime soon, at least in the
next three weeks, the State Labor
Board will declare the ﬁrst election
on this campus to choose between

    

unionization or no unionization in
the history of the institution's
faculty. ‘
This election will cap nearly two
years of work on the part of
pro-union elements in the Universi-
ty, 38 days of official testimony and
untold thousands of dollars spent
on either side to direct the outcome
of the nearing election.

As it stands right now, all the
interested parties are in a watch‘
and wait period. gathering their
forces for the beginning of the real
campaigns which will begin as soon
as the State Board makes a decision
on the type, size and constituency
of the bargaining units on campus.

The bargaining unit is a sort of
territory in which the union

‘ functions, and is the very basisiof a

a_
.

union's ability to face management
in the interests of its members.
Make the bargaining unit too
large and it becomes unwieldy,
difficult to control and almost
impossible to unite when and if the
time comes, for a head-to-head
confrontation with management.
Make it too small and the
bargaining unit carries no clout.

and so union leadership views the .

size and constituency of bargaining

units very carefully.

The University. on the other

- hand. has stated for the record that

it would prefer a campus-wide

Tfaeulty u_ni,o_n,g including; all Winem-.. '.ipponents... :

’ bargaining unit. '

bers of the faculties of the various
schools.

From a_ management “point of
view this single, giant bargaining
unit would be much easier to deal

_ with. One union, one contract, one
set of demandsand so on. Not to
mention ‘the fact that if indeed
large bargaining units make for
weak unions, University labor
experts would be foolish to ask for
anything else. A '

Now the above is the-generaliza-
tion, when in fact the three unions
working towards collective bargain-
ing at Pitt have differing views on
what exactly would be the best

This was the

subject of 38 days to testimony
before a state hearing-examiner.

Since the close of testimony
earlier this term, the hearing
examiner has filed a conﬁdential
report to the State Board, making
his recommendation as to how Pitt
should be split for a union election.

According to a source close to the
State Labor Board, the recommen-
dation suggests Pitt be cut into four
separate bargaining units, one in
the medical school, one in the law
school. one in the health-related
professions and one in the
Provost’s area, ‘which includes all
remaining schools and would
‘comprise the largest voting popula-
tion. ‘

There is still a chance the State
Board could change the hearing
examin;er’s recommendation, but
in any event, after the ﬁnal
decision is handed down, the real
work will begin.

_ In the meantime look fora sharp
in rease in union and anti-union
act vity in all areas, building to a
pe k at the date of elections, which
so e in the union struggle at Pitt
see as soon as February.

ln some quarters the first signs
are already evident.~ Faculty
members. opposed to faculty
unionization are meeting next
week to hold a symposium on the
cffectsof collective bargaining on
Pitt. ‘ ' - ‘

Whatever the decision from the
State Labor Board, this coming
Christmas break will be no vacation
for faculty union forces or their

between the RSA and the Office of
Residence Life,” said Cliff Pretz-
man, RSA treasurer. According to
Protzman, new locations are going
to be considered and other
suggestions will be examined. '

Protzman also said timers will be ’

installed on the machines to control
when the machines are to be used.

"The machines may be — used
from noon until midnight,” Portz-
man said. “We also _are going to

have signs posted to inform the

students of the new regulations.”
Since the machines already have

been moved twice this semester, a '

final decision on their location will
not come until next semester.
According to Protzman, this will
give the RSA and Residence Life
enough time to weigh the alterna-
tives and ﬁnd the best solution to
the problem.

With finals passing before their eyes,» two Pitt students attempt to
digest the entire term in a one-hour sitting in the Cathedral. According .

T to some reports, there has been a higher incidence of study and prayer

in the last week, sparking a comment by one authority that “they’re

working their butts off in that joint.”

Pitt OK'd for Police Training A B

BY BILL MOORE

Pitt has been certiﬁed as a state
training facility for police forces
required to meet the guidelines of

, the state Lethal Weapons Training

Act, according to Campus Police
Sergeant Richard Walters.
Although Pitt's state-related
standing exempts its police force
from many of the act's require-
mcnts. the Pennsylvania Council of
Higher Education approached ’Pitt
to ask it to become, one.of four

Emergency Loans Available 

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR

Two separately administered
e-mergency loan funds are available
to Pitt students.

The Student Emergency Loan
Fund, administered by the Office of
Student Activities, will loan a
maximum $100 to undergraduate
or graduate students for education-
al purposes. such as paying for.
books or tuition. over .a maximum
period of 90 days.

Although students are-..required_
to obtain an endorsement by
parents or some othe'r person
considered ﬁnancially responsible,
they can, in most cases, following
an interview and upon completion
of an application form, expect their
money within three days. A

tified to train officers to meet the
state requirements, Walters said.
. Twenty-six persons, including 12
Pitt officers, and officers from
Duqucsne, Chatham and local
hospitals, are enrolled in the ﬁrst
‘phase of the 80-hour course.
Along with the required sections
on firearms use, Pitt has added to
the course various sections dealing
with narcotics, first aid,’sociology,
psychology and safety, Walters
said.

Louis~McLinden, assistant direc-
tor of Student Activities, explained
the fund is composed of three
endowments. .

The Mrs. George H. Clapp Loan
Fund, established in 1929, original-
ly totaled $5,000. The Bing Crosby
Youth Fund Student Loan, estab-
lished in l966, had an initial
amount of $2,000.

The third source. Pitt’s ‘Men's
Council, no longer exists. but its
loanfund is administered by the
Office of Student Activities.

McLindcn said, “At the present
time, we have a total of $100 in the
emergency fund,- but we will
probably be out of money by today.

"The amount we are actually
able to loan to students is-directly
proportional to the current balance,
which is the sum of loans repaid by
students." '

Though McLindcn could not say
which class (freshman, sophomore,
etc.) made the most use of the
fund. he did say the peak periods
for loans corresponded to the end
of the ﬁrst term and the beginning
of the winter term. .

NEWS  
ROUNDUPl

BY BILL MOORE

The fall term wasn't a momen-
tous time for news, lacking
anything on the scale of last year’s
widely embattled tuition hike,. but
many less spectacular stories did
appear, many of them promising to
make the next four months both
interesting and important.

Among them were:

SEPTEMBER 5, 1975

The controversial new ticket-

"‘».:~ distribution method for home

football games was announced by

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs

Alfred Moye, and received immed-

iate criticism from representatives

of the Student Government Board
(SGB).

Burger Chef, replacing the
much-loved Tuck Shop in the
Cathedral basement, opened its
doors to crowds that were, at ﬁrst,
wary of the bright lights and fast
food.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1975

Pitt administrators were accused
of originally planning to charge

students admission to attend home V

football games by SGB President
 Larry Platt.

\.§)

The University Senate passed a
resolution adding a. student_ mem-
ber to a panel studying faculty
unioni/.ation.

SEPTEMBER 12, 1975

The Engineering Student Cabin-
ct. more upset than most about the
ticket coupon I plan, voted to
support a proposed boycott of Pitt
football games by engineering
students.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1975

Refusing to forget, a coalition of
student leaders called for the
resignation of Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski, charging he
misrepresented the allegedly criti-
cal shortage of seating for home
football games that resulted in the
coupon plan.

The leaders. including heads of
the SGB, the lnterfraternity Coun-
cil, BAS, and others, charged
Myslinski with lying when he said
the‘ Notre Dame game had been
sold out.

Myslinski denied the charges.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1975

Reacting to the call for the
athletic direetor’s resignation,
Chancellor Posvar issued a state-
ment. increasing the amount of
seating allocated for student use,
but retaining the coupon system.

SGB and Resident Student
Association leaders joined forces to
blast another unpopular plan—the
updated" dorm security system-
claiming there was not enough
student input.

protest of the coupon plan and
alleged misleading of students by

Chancellor Posvar, present at the

  Pre-Election Bungling

~ It’s-strange the Student Government Board (SGB) would lose sight of
. the coming elections when we have naturally come to accept re-election
time as the politician's favorite season. . ' ' A ‘
_If we choose, "we can look on this nonconcem as a sign for the better.
But for better or worse, the failure of the SGB to make sufficient

preparations for January’s elections will in one way or another be
»' crippling to the elective process and open the door for malcontents _to
challenge the outcome once the vote is over.
Though it was the job of last year's Board to appoint the Judiciary
Committee that would eventually select the Elections Committee, it
can’t be overlooked that the current SGB had all year to rectify their

 J predecessors’ error.

As it stands, a number of things can happen, depending on the

g T ‘.CO1.l.I‘Se of the SGB’s action: ﬁrst, the election can be postponed,
’ ‘ - keeping the usual campaign period intact; second, the election can be

held as scheduled, and third, the requirement_of candidates to petition
for signatures can be waived, permitting anyone who can meet the

I _ other requirements a spot on the ballot. .

No matter which read is taken, the normal procedure will in some I

' way be aborted.

. The least of all evils seems to be the suspension of candidate
petitions so the election can be held, on its usual date.

Regardless of what the SGB does, however, students will no doubt
remember this-ﬁasco when reading the names of the incumbents on the

it ._ voting machine.

Pole for study purposes (it was the

to prompt me to study for ﬁnals), I
met a fascinating man.

./He is the controller and boss of a.

He has over 10,000 direct

He is more
than Howard Hughes,
fatter than Sidney Greenstreet, and
has a better ad campaign than
Alka-Seltzer. And he is loved even

more than Jack Benny was. His
name, to us, is Santa Claus.
I met Mr. Claus quite by

accident. I was sitting on a snow
‘bank, ﬁnally studying Oedipus
Rex, and basking in the silence.

‘I P Suddenly, since it is my destiny to

be forever interrupted in my
studying, a man walked up to me
out of nowhere. He said, “Hello,”
with a deep, masculine voice, and
an accent like Grducho. Marx. The

“Freddie!” I said. “Did you

Blitzen is a reindeer, who presently

boarded the sleigh, and Blitzen
returned without us. So I never
saw Santa Claus’ castle, but we did

" ‘How do you deliver all those

asked, in the style of Marie Torre.

laughed at me. “I have associates

Where You Think You Are

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

If anyone ever tells you this is
Pittsburgh, don't believethem.
Few people know it, but we are
living under one of the greatest
deccptions in history. This decep-
tion is being perpetrated by a
coalition of mapmakers and geog-
raphers. who have undertaken to
make us believe we are where we
are not. _ = _

When we drive up the Parkway,
how do we know we are really
entering Pittsburgh and not St.
Louis? The only word we have to go
on is the map in our car and the
signs on the road.‘ By whose
determination are they a valid
reference. Only by mapmakers’
and signmakers’? And who
appointed them the _task of
determining where we are? The
answer of course is no one.

The origin of this deception was
over 400 years ago when an Italian
mapmaker scrawled, his name
across the portion of his map at that
time known as the “New World."
The general public, taking his
name to mean the name of the
land, started refering to it as
America. If this mapmaker had
only signed his last name, then our
country would be known ‘as
Vespueei. The real crime here is
that the New World has been

\ totally robbed of having an original
‘name.-

es/calated. Instead of having a new
country with a new name and lots
places, all sorts of
nonexistent places have gained the
reputation of existing.

Now you may ask, if the
‘conspiracy already has succeeded
in convincing us that this is
America-when it really is not, then
why botherwith deceiving us into

believing the existence ‘ of ‘other I

. 9 - ’
places.

The answer is obvious. By

. convincing us of the existence. of a

lot of places, we are a lot less likely

to question the existence of,‘
America. It is the old philosophy.

that a bigger lie will be more easily
swallowed than a smaller one.
Perhaps an illustration will make

Lower East Side of New York, and I
have this uge chateau in France,
outside Paris, wherethis gorgeous
chatelaine lives.” (I have to look
that word up——just a lady who lives

in a chateau). “Oh, what a

magniﬁcent creature. People think
I only like reindeer for their

sleekness, but they’ve "never asked —

me about my French woman.”
“I see,” I interrupted, writing all
this down. “Then being Santa
Claus isn't such a bad business
after all?”

“Not such a bad business!” He
was shouting again. “-Last year my
workers organized a union. They
want more money, and two sets of
longjohns for every Christmas.
They want retirement I beneﬁts.
And free toys for their children.

. And the toymakers. Now they are .

manufacturers. They make twelve
varieties of the same toy, just so I
have to keep them straight. And
they charge more for the toys, but
still give me the same royalties
they did back in 1262. Not such a
bad business?! I'm the only boss
who doesn't give a Christmas
vacation. And my French lady
wants me to go on a diet, but it’s
_part of my job to be-fat. And it’-s
‘hard to get people to work for me,
because no one ever believes who I
am. So all my employes are a little
meshugeh. ,
‘_‘Not such a bad business being
Santa Claus, you say? Feh, I say to
you."

~ I was beginning to feel like Carl

Reiner interviewing Mel Brooks.
He told me he was tired of being
the only person whose first name
was accented over his last. Finally
he calmed down and asked,
“Wheredo you live, little girl???

things clearer. For example, I‘have
always doubted the existence of
Poughkeepsie. There seems to be
no reason why anyone would want
to name a town Poughkeepsie
unless they had some evil designs
for the world. I once met a person
.who was reputed to be from
Poughkeepsie, but I am convinced
that she was really a member of the
conspiracy, sent to allay
suspicions. I am further convinced.
ofthis because I have only seen her
once in my four years at Pitt.
New York, New.York- is suspect
because it has the same name
twice. Why should New York be in
New York if it is already New York?
The only answer is that New _York is
not New York, which is why it can
be in New York, What then, is New
York? This is a good question, ‘and‘I

suspect that the answer lies
somewhere with Vespueei.
One of my most Shocking

discoveries was ﬁnding that my'

home town, Allentown, may be
part of this grand deception. As I
was driving in New Jersey this
summer, a good hundred miles
from where I had always thought
Allentown to be. I noticed a.sign
which read, “Exit to "Allentown -
3/4 mile."'Imagine my shock when
Iidiscovcred the Allentown I knew
and‘ loved may not be the real
Allentown. Of course, the New
Jersey Allentown may be the

counterfeit one, but the thought of -

there being an imitation Allentown
was just too much. ,

But when I think about it, there
are -dozens of places that have

City to name two. The case of
Kansas City is interesting. Some-
one is trying to make us believe
there is- a Kansas City, Missouri as
well as in Kansas. However, logic
dictates that if there exists a city in

‘r

Kansas then it seems logical it“-,_*.,'Z

would be called Kansas City. A
similar place in Missouri should be
called Missouri City.

Or take the cases of Indiana and
California. People living in those
places do not know whether they
are really living in Pennsylvania, or
if California is in Indiana or ifiall
three are really streets in Hacken-
sack, New Jersey.

Most distressing is that our
government is taking part in all
this, either willingly or unwillingly.
The turnpike commission, for

‘example, prints turnpike cards that

list exits to various and sundry
places._ Since we ‘end up ‘paying.
tolls to get to these places, we
rationalize their existencein order
to ‘justify our paying tolls to get
there. However, as the toll booths
get more and more automated, I_
am beginning to doubt even the

_ existence of the turnpike commis-

sion.

I do not know the solution to this
dilemma, nor do I even know that
a solution is desirable. It may be
better for all of us to continue living
in ignorance. Maybe I am doubting.
the wrong things. Perhaps it is the
existence of conspirators and
Italian mapmakers which should be

doubted. Or, it is possible that only ’

Pittsburgh really exists, and that
the rest of the world originates
from here? I doubt it. E

Who is better qualiﬁed to

 research a guide to the best routes

‘between buildings for students
~ using wheelchairs on _the Oakland
‘campus than the handicapped
.4 students themselves?

_ f‘There are tricks that other

people wouldn't be aware of," Jeff
—Palmer. a junior at Pitt, said. “The
ionly easy access into a building
" may be through a loading dock."
‘ Palmer and three other students
‘are mapping the location of ramps
enabling wheelchair students to
know where they can get from
street to sidewalk. This plus
identifying the new wheelchair
up around

" and the‘University will be included
inan accessibility guide. The guide
will be completed next spring for

. - the Ofﬁcenof Veterans Affairs and
-. Disabled Students (OVA).

d“The guide will emphasize

._»_where they can't get to,” according
to Palmer. “When I first came to
campus l had to drop two classes

where people can go instead of

because l couldn't get to them.’

OVA has helped solve problems
for veterans since 1972 and has
expanded its service to include
other temporarily and permanently
disabled students over the past
year.

Providing services for disabled
students is a delicate tightrope to
walk. .

"You can eventually become
depend_ent, not just when you
really need a hand, but for little
things like having someone pick up

books at the library instead of.

going yourself," a blind doctoral
student said. “You begin to
question your own ability to
function when you fall into the trap
of accepting too much help.-”
OVA Director Jack Hayes, a
veteran himself, explained, “Stu-
dents who are best served are those
who help themselves. We’re”not
trying to do the whole job for the
student." .
A service organization, like a
friend. needs -to understand a
problem before they can help.
The young director is straight-
forward. He refers to his staff of

  

four as “creative amateurs in
student problem solving.

“Some social service people
have a preconcievcd idea in mind
and try to serve their constituents
on that basis without really
knowing what their problems are,"
Hayes said. “I tell my staff to"
worry about the guy across the
desk. We do what we can,'if it's not
within our power to do, we get the
student to someone who can do it.

“Anyone in the University
willing to take 10 or 15 minutes out
to help can often solve the
problem," Hayes said.

An electric wheelchair stands in
front of -Hayes desk. A student
needed space _for the chair’s
storage and recharging. Hayes
offered his fifth floor Schenley Hall
office. The chair'sihad a place ever
since.

Another student interested in
water‘ therapy and swimming
secured a special student member-
ship for the pool at Y-IKC ‘on
Bellefield Avenue through OVA. A
‘blind student needed tape record-
ing and other equipment. Hayes’
office called the Bureau for the

patched a car to pick up the

'l‘eniporarily disabled students,
for exaniple a person with a broken
leg. havealso received assistance
from OVA.

Exteiiding their expertise in
servicing veterans to other disabled
students has been the long range
plan for the office since its
inception in 1972. But in August,
1974. Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye told OVA to
begin familiarizing itself with the
needs and interests of disabled
students. , ‘

ln the middle of a period of the
largest veteran enrollment since
just after World War II and with no
additional budget allocations, OVA
undertook the new mandate.

Thomas Gilanti, a blind graduate
in speech, communications and
psychology, was hired this past
summer as University adviser,
for disabled students. Keeping in
step with the expansion of the
office, Gilanti has been collecting
information on post-secondary edu-
cation and the disabled, as well as

-interviewing disabled students to

understand some of their prob-
leins. ’

, "Gamma Gamma Sigma, the
service sorority. is recording
campus publications for blind

students," Gilanti said, citing one

current project. “The tapes will be
available in our office and
elsewhere on campus."

Through late 1974 and early l97S
OVA budget surpluses were used
to send representatives to three
universities known for their service
to the disabled. One was the
University of Illinois at Cham-
pagne-Urbaiia, which is prominent
for
electronic/mechanical aids for stu-
dents. The others, the University of
Calil'oi‘n'ia at Berkeley and Long
lsland University, were in urban
settings and utilized old buildings.

Pitt Dancers (Stir Imagination

BY A. IRENE SCHMDT

Imagination, more than skill,
was the keynote of the Pitt Dance
Ensemble’s program at Stephen
Foster Memorial last night. The
choice of music supported a varied
and entertaining series of dances
that somehow fit under the title,
“Dances for Wet Weather.”

The musical selections, from the

_ waltzes of Johannes Brahms to the

ragtime of Scott Joplin to the
national dances of Israel, carried
the Ensemble over the program’s
weak spots and accentuated its

V strengths.

The Ensemble was enhanced by
the choreography and dancing of
Dan Wagoner, head of a New York
dance company and presently‘ the
afﬁliated artist with the Pittsburgh
Dance Council. In addition to
doing choreography for the third
dance, Dan’,s Run’s Penny Supper,
Wagoner performed two short
solos, both self-choreographed.

The ﬁrst solo, Rag Dances, was a
visualization of a Joplin composi-
tion.
example of Wagoner’s freeness on
the stage and his ability to project

 

with simple movements.. Despite
the intensity of his features, which
bring to mind a rather intelligent
and good-looking Cro-Magnon
man, Wagoner combined the
comedy of a Charlie Chaplin dance
with the inherent grace of a trained
ballet dancer. In effect, it was‘the

further was strengthened by
Posnak’s,mastery at the piano.

Turkey Struts, stomps and glides
were at home in the French recital
atmosphere of Mozart and Chopin.

In Storyville jazz piano, a strong
left hand was imperative to stomp
it and step it out. The offbeat
rhythmic syncopation of barrel
house blues tpiano gave way to
ragged or ragtime, the earliest
crystallization form of jazz. Synon-
ymous with ragtime is Scott Joplin,
who was known for his ecclesiasti-
cal playing: “The right -hand
knoweth not what the left hand
doeth."

Posnak proceeded to play a

‘sophisticated, urbane and compli-
cated composition by Joplin equal ‘

in elegance to any‘ classical piece.

Blues is the rhythm of speech
superimposed over the rhythm of
work, and characteristic of James
Pete Johnson, King of the Kansas
City Stompers..
stop-action playing brought to

mind the dance style of the time.‘

Fats Waller's “Viper‘s Rag.". a
satire on cowboy and
lndian movies followed “For Me
and My Gal." played in dry caustic
iro_nic cocktail style. Posnak played
each the way it was meant to be.
When at home Fats would practice
playing Bach fugucs.

-, Why then were those N.Y. Dixie
Bands from New ‘Orleans so

castigated and described 
"J'ass" niusicians?

It came across as a perfect _

The second solo was less

audience rather bewildered.

seems. A

the program. The accompaniment

and “Amazing Grace” sung by a
senile baritone. However, several
movements stood out, characteri-
zed by excellent solo dances.

Susan Gillis, a teaching assis-
tant, and Margaret Skriner, a
instructor at Pitt, were
especially noteworthy. Gillis and
Edward Rupert also danced several
perfectly executed pas de deux.

panicked and shut down Storyville
fearful of its lurid and sensuous
ﬂavor. The “Big Band Sound"
capitalized by creating watered-
down versions_of Jelly Roll Morton,
James Pete Johnson, and Fats
Waller. Now jazz ‘became
acceptable to society.

Paul Posnak is concerned with

returning to the beauty and vitality '

of the original. His performance
last night lent convincing credibil-
ity to the inﬂuence of classical over
jar.‘/.. and vica versa. - Pos‘nak’s
rendition of Chopin was as complex
and intricate as Jelly Roll's Blues
earlier in the show.

With a genius and talent as‘

interested as Posnak's in preserv-
ing authentic old-time jazz and
ragtime. we can fortunately retain
this vital aspect of American folk
tradition. '

minutes. Although the dancers
tried, the one short week of
rehearsal necessitated by the
services of a New York choreo-
grapher took its toll on the ﬁnal
production.

In addition, the dance suffered
from its staging. For such a serious
performance, the audience ‘is
simply too close to the stage in

   
    

 

qr .

Stephen Foster. In a dance like
this, the performers must be
bodies, ‘not people. Seeing the
dancer’s expressions,‘ the slight
missteps and the involuntary
trembling in‘ a strained pose is
almost embarrassing.

The movements in ‘Brahms’
Waltzes also seemed, somehow
incongruous. Some seem to be
derived from classical ballet, some
from black dance, some from such
dances as the minuet. Together,
they were jarring, adding to the

. lack of continuity that characterized

1

the entire‘ piece.

In contrast, the evening's last
selection, Holiday in Israel, was
beautifully» choreographed. The
music was interrupted by the voice
of the narrator, who explained that
each dance was the contribution of
various nationality groups in_ Israel
to the ancient Festival of the Fruits.

Costuming (Heidi Hollman Pri-
barn) and lighting (Dick Knowles
and Vickie Paal) were excellent,
climaxing with the performance of
the national dance of Israel, the
Hora. The dancers whirled in a
large circle,.dark ﬁgures illumin-

. ated only by occasional ﬂashlights,

silhouetted against a slowly dark-
ening blue background.

The dancing was good, but the
music was better. Dance can be
one of the most accurate illustra-
tions of music. Perhaps the music

- was just too good—it’s not easy to

surpass the best. ,

ls Relief for

BY TOM WASELESKI.

The Hissing of Summer Lawns '
Joni Mitchell

    

IOITIOITOW - '

But for the work I've taken on 

Stoking the star maker
machinery
Behind the popular song.” .
Joni Mitchell seemed to .be
making a confession in her last
album that she finally was set to
jump tocommercial rock from her

more aesthetic genre.

Highly praised by fans and if

nonfans alike, Court and Spark sold

in markets that had had no. use for .  

Mitchell’s music. The reason—a
deﬁnite change in style.

Court and Spark was a sleek,
slick album. You could whistle the
songs; you could even sing them.

Some, like “Help Me” and “Free 1
Man in Paris," were suitable for-

recording by Ray Coniff, Johnn
Mann and the like. ' '

What was going on here? This‘,

wasn’t Joni Mitchell.

Deep down, her fans feared the
more traditionally structured melo-
dies and their consequent success

would point Mitchell in a more pop by

direction.

It's understandable why this i

album, The Hissing‘ of Summer‘
Lawns, was so anxiously awaited.
And the verdict as seen by this
juror is that Mitchell is not out to
compete with Olivia Newton-John.
Despite the initial comfort. this

brings, there is stillmuch in the -

album that is disturbing—in a nice
sort of way.
This may be a concept album-
not that a concept .

Conductor Rates Fair

' BY PAMELA EUSI

J amesLevine, a major American
conductor, was supposed to take
dual roles as soloist and conductor
in this weekend’s Pittsburgh
Symphony concert. I say was
supposed to because for some
unknown reason he didn’t, and _a
mediocre concert (instead of a
great one)- resulted.
Johanos, the Symphony's associate
conductor, and Robert de Gaetano
ﬁlled Levine’s shoes. They tried.

Two of the program's pieces
came off quite well in spite of
Johanos' conducting. But the ﬁrst
work, Bach's Concerto in (1 minor
for Piano and Orchestra, left a lot
to be desired. ,

It's not that de Gaetano played
badly; he did all the right things at
the right ,times.— He started out
weakly and continued that way
until a few intense moments near
the end of the third movment.

In its Pittsburgh premiere,Three
Orchestral Pieces, Opus 6 by Alban
Berg turned out to be one of the
bright spots in the concert. Berg
admired Gustav, Mahler, and
Berg's style ’resembled that of

The second movement’s _intro-
duction , reminded me of the
“Prelude a_ la nuit ” from Ravel’s
Rapsodie Espagnole. A slow waltz
theme is interrupted by a trumpet
call that clears the way for ominous
brass chords, various string ef-
fects, heavy celesta and xylophone

emphasis, and piccolo and clarinet "

cavortings. - -

There was _no way of telling what _ A I 

to expect or from where it would
come next. The orchestra almost
blasted the audience from its seats;

After the intermission, the air of_ ‘
excitement was maintained with‘

Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A
Major, Opus 92. This symphony
is so crammed with rhythms that
you almost want to dance in the
aisles at several points.

The second movment is ‘one of
Beethoven’s most famous. The
theme is stated again and again,
first by the lower strings then by all
the string sections, until the entire
orchestra is contributing to the
weaving of this musical tapestry. f

something to be uneasy about, but

i the fact that it may and yet may not

be one is what is so distressing.
The 10 songs are held together
by a fine, yet ever-present, thread
of references to things African.
“Rousseau walks on trumpet

_ paths, safaris to the heart of all

that jazz”...And he chains me with
that serpent to that Ethiopian

in ~wall”...“There’s a black ﬂy buz-
” zing, There's a heat wave burning

in her master's voice, And the
hissing of summer lawns.” And
there are songs entitled “The
Jungle Line” and ,“The Boho

—» Dance.’ ’

A_.Yet with all this tribal, tropical
footnoting, the great body of the
songs are stinging commentaries

A . on suburban American life.

“In France They Kiss on Main
Street” plays with the dichotomy of
parent-child generations, at least
as seen from the standpoint of
kissingin public: “Amour, mama,
not cheap display.”

.“Edith and the Kingpin” docu-
ments a small-town gangster’s

" nightclub ploy to pick any woman
he wants.

A poignant depiction of love
succumbing to the -doldrums of

I middle age is found in “Harry’s

House”:
. “He's caught up in Chief of Staff

 Joni's LPYie|ds Contrasts

‘ I

“‘lf (>...'. .
.» ‘ I. 1

He drifts off into memory

Of the way she looked in school

With her body oiled and shining

At the public swimming pool...”

The lyrics overall are crisp. The
music. however, is somewhat-
lackluster. As usual, the melodies
are subtle, but perhaps a little too
bereft of color, despite the
multitude of tones in Mitchell’s
inﬂective voice. p

Probably the strongest song on
the record is “Shades of Scarlet
Conquering." Much of it resem-
bles “Down to You” from Court
and Spark in its quiet force. Even
without Mitchell’s expressive vo-
cals, this piece can stand alone on
the sheer tightness of its melody.

A strange closing tune, “Sha-
dows‘and'Light," is sung prac-
tically a cappella; the only
accompaniment is the intermittent
buzz of a synthesizer. As if it were
a Gregorian chant, Mitchell cantil-
lates several lines, then responds
with multiple voice trackings in
unison. _

Here she once more returns to
primitive references: “Man of

-cruelty—mark of Cain, Drawn to all

things. Man of delight—born
again, born again. Man of the
laws, the ever-broken laws, Gover-'
ning wrong, wrong and right."
Even the cover lends itself to as
theme, contrasting the tribal
existence with that of modern

suburbia. The top half shows
several suburban dwellings on the
periphery of a city; in
foreground is a band of natives
carrying a hugh snake.
Mitchell says on the inner sleeve
that the album- as a whole
“unfolded like a mystery." and
that “it is not my intention to
unravel that mystery for anyone."
Whether she herself knows the
intricacies behind the mystery is
hard to tell. But The Hissing of
Summer Lawns, perplexing though
it may be. leaves Mitchell’s fans
with welcome relief, for this is
obviously not the one-dimensional
stuff of which Top-40 is made.

our immoral destruction of our own
being and those who surround us.
Until this reality is accepted people
aren't going to understand the rest
of Neil Young.
' Zuma isjust another Neil Young
record. It is on the same label,
sounds the same as any other in
your collection and will play just
like the others.

There is one difference—this
Neil Young record is the best since
Everybody Knows... I put this in
the position of :1 Yesterday and
Today. This is the record you will
look back on and see that it was
Neil’s revival. Like the Beatles it
‘has the roots, the reclamation of
those roots, but it _also has a brand
new direction to travel in.

Musically Zumal has the same
sound as the old Crazy Hors
material (they are part of this grou,
again with Frank Sampedro or
rhythm guitar). The electric guitar
and machine-gun solos are present.
The extended jamming and the
bounce that Crazy Horse had is
again relived. It is a sound so
welcome after all the garbage
contemporary artists are schlocking

out. .
The songs’ lyrics are shattering

to the emotions; his shocking

introspection, which everybody
thought might be gone with
Tonight because of his pointing out
style. is as penetrating as ever.
“Cortcz the Killer"
Zuma. “On the
Montezuma/With his coca leaves
and pearls/In his halls he often
‘wondered/with the secrets of the
worlds” is a "historic song for a
people who have no history..us.
This country is so new_and young
and .we think we are so mature.
“But they built up with their bare
hands/What we still‘ can't do

is about

today."

Needless to say I feel this album
is an important one not only for
Neil Young but for the musical
world. The screeching guitar and
matching voice of Neil Young has
lost many folks. This is not music
for everybody. You who are into
disco will not like it. You who enjoy
jazz (or should I say Jazz) will not
like it. If you own Starship for the
song “Miracles,’7 forget it kids.

This album is for those of you
who know what being bummed out

is like. Who know what sadness is A

and can relate to it in songs with
Neil Young singing them. This

album is for...well, it's for me, "

that’s for sure.

// '.‘

I‘:

The Universitylof Pittsburgh Support Personnel Association ,(UPSPA) has been organizing at Pitt for over
a year. Our Association initiated and carried on this organizing effort. At no time since we began organizing at Pitt

has anotherorganization approached any Pitt staff employees.

Only the University of Pittsburgh Support Personnel Association has consistently held meetings’, circulated
cards, leaﬂets, extensive mailings, and the hard day to day worklwith the objective of informing University em-

frail; ployees about collective bargaining as a means of improving conditions of employment.

The University of Pittsburgh Support Personnel Association (UPSPA) has demonstrated that it has the _
support and confidence of the overwhelming majority of staff. Through hard work, we have been able to come

further than any other organization which has ever attempted to organize Pitt staff employees.

Our efforts have resulted in the scheduling of a secret ballot election. Now another union, which has never
before contacted Pitt staff employees, seeks a place on the ballot. Over 1,000 staff members at Pitt have signed
authorization cards with UPSPA, which is far in excess of the 30 percent required by the Pe_nnsylvania_Labor

Relations Board (PLRP) for an election. Because of our efforts, this other organization needs only one percent on
J'‘g?; ’ the ballot. ' . '

We view this intervention as an attempt to dividethe unionivote.

We intend to stand united in order to guarantee complete victory in the effort we initiated for the benefit

of the employees atathe University of Pittsburgh‘.

 The Long 8
   Goodbye

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

 Since thisis my last issue as sports editor of The Pitt News, I'd like to
ask you to remember a few things with me since I took over this office
last March.

‘ Y One-of the biggest things thathappened at Pitt late last Winter term

was the resignation of Charles “Buzz” Ridl as headrbasketball coach

'5 '~ and the hiring of his replacement, Tim Grgurich. Although I didn’t

. with him?

know Ridl that well, he never turned me away, and he always had
something sensible to say. He thought it was best to retire after taking
two successive teams to post-season tournaments. Who could argue

» Assistant Coach Grgurich stepped ‘up and the tempo of Pitt
basketball immediately did, too. At 32, “Grg” is regarded as one of

,the best young coaches in America today. And when he took over

things looked pretty rosy for yet another post-‘season offer in the
1975-76 season. But then the roof fell in. First Melvin Bennett, who
had sucha fantastic freshman year, waved bye-bye to an education and

' went to the big leagues for a shot at a good hunk of money. And why

not? Who wants to pass up making more bread in a year than he would
have probably made in six lifetimes?

Then there was the Phil Hubbard episode, or how I gave up the Steel
City and learned to love snow. Hubbard, who was supposed to be the
second coming of Sidney Wickes, found that after he was supposedly

p loyal to the Blue and Gold, he suddenly became very friendly with the

Michigan Wolverines, so friendly he decided to play his basketball
there. , < '
And then there was the Kelvin Smith episode, or what’s good for
every" kid in Pittsburgh is good enough for a 6-11 basketball center. A
technicality of sorts in correcting and making up grades did away with
probably one of the best centermen Pitt will ever have. But then if he
decides to stick it out at Pitt and show he can cut it academically he will
be in the same position as one, William Knight. And we all remember
him, don’t we? ‘

But losing two recruits and a top returning player wasn’t enough for V

the new head honcho. Tommy Richards, one of the smoothest men in

‘the East as a guard, fell on his hand during a practice and broke his

wrist. Although he still isplaying, he is not up to the par he has set for
the past three years. ’

And ﬁnally, last but certainly not least, is Keith Starr. Yes, Keith
Starr, the man touted by Sports Information before the start of the
season as a sure All-American, the kid who could do it all—play
defense, shoot, rebound, pass the ball—you name it, he could do it.
From watching him the past two years I would have to agree. But he,
too. wasiinjured during an exhibition game with a touring Yugoslavian
team, an injury that could really cause Grgurich to tear his hair out in
large clumps. - .

However, at last look Starr was coming around nicely _and could
begin playing up" to potential in a few weeks. For Grgurich’s sake let’s
hope so. If not it will certainly be a long season when the likes of
Marquette, Notre Dame and other powerhouses take on the Panthers.

Early last spring, Head Track Coach Jim Banner left the Panther fold

. and went across the street to Carnegie-Mellon University to become its

 

athletic director. Banner’s years at Pitt were some of the most fruitful
ever in the history of the school. When everyone else was losing big he
consistently put together winning teams in both indoor and outdoor
track, proving you don’t have to have a million-dollar budget to turn
out quality teams. ‘

His successor, like Ridl‘s, was a young dynamic assistant, Mike
Agostinella. “Gus” was a former field event man at Slippery Rock.
He gets along with everyone on the team and has the expertise to take
up where Banner left off and keep building the track squad into one of
the best in the East. Congratulations to both Grgurich and Agostinella.

In the tank.«Coach Dick Bradshaw should go around bragging. He
has one of the finest swimming teams in the country—certainly east of
the Mississippi. Last year it destroyed most of its opponents with ease
and this year it is much stronger. Pitt destroyed everyone at the recent
Penn State Relay Championships, including arch-rival Maryland.

Associate Sports Editor

The 1975 Pitt Panther basketball
squad may not be as big as in
former years. But there is no lack of
desire or hustle on the current
team. One thing was blatantly
evident in last weekend’s double
loss to Duquesne and Syracuse-

the Pitt Panthers played their guts-

out. '
A crowd of 7,551 saw one of the
most tense games in recent Steel
Bowl history as Duquesne edged
the Panthers, "75-74,
night’s highlight contest.

It‘ was a bruising battle in which
the smaller Panthers out-rebound-
ed the Dukes, 39-35, without the
services of center Ralph McClel-
land who .sat out much of the
second half with four personal
fouls. McClelland still battled
under therboards to scrape off 12
bounds, a game high.

His performance made believers
out of a lot of Pitt fans, and wiped
the smirks from the faces of the
Duquesne partisans. who knew

  Tankers Win Big

BY JIM LEWIS

You no longer have to go to the _

National Record Mart for a record.-
You can now go to Trees Pool.
Trees Pool?

Yep. Just ask Pitt Men’s
Swimming Coach Dick Bradshaw,
Diving Coach Dave Coffey, or
Assistant Coach Fred Lewis and

, they’ll gladly show you their team’s

long list of records ‘shattered en
route to the Panthers’. wonderful

_ PSU Relays Champion title victory,

the first in their history.

Thirteen teams competed in the
event and Pitt won seven of the 12
relay events—all of them PSU
Relays recordbreakers. The
Panthers outscored six-time champ
Maryland by 340-306.

“Consistency and good physical
shape,” Bradshaw beamed when
asked the reasons for his team’s
standout pbrformance.

Consistency especially. »,,Pitt
constantly broke records and pulled
far away from the 12-team pack
early, beginning with the very first
event, the 2000-yard freestyle.

Bradshaw had to chuckle over
that one.

“Before the event, the Maryland
coach cameover tome and said
that he felt whoever won the 2000
yard freestyle would win the
championship,” he explained.

And the Maryland coach was
right—much to his dismay. Pitt
won the freestyle, and the title.
Bob Clemmer, Neil Wasserman,
Bob Greenwald and Jerry DeMuro
sped quickly away from the
second-place Terrapins to win the
event in a record-breaking 19:38.66
time. ’

That was only the beginning.

Dave Civis, Greenwald, John‘
Schepner and Dennis Harrington
(whose 46.83 time helped Pitt come
back to steal first place) teamed up
to break another record, with a
3:12.15 in the 400-yard freestyle
relay.

The Panthers broke yet another
record and took a first place, this
time in.the 400-yard breaststroke
relay, with Mike Nelson, Clemmer,
Orlando Catinchi and John Templin
finishing in a 4:07.03 time, leaving
second-place Maryland in the dust
(or water?) by a full five seconds.

Then came the one-meter diving.

~ Pitt is known for its great diying
P team, but who’d have thought Jeff

in _Friday

before the game that Pitt would get
killed on the boards.

But the real superlatives belong
to 6-6 forward Willie (“the
Rejector”) Kelly. Playing what
must be the best game of his
career, Kelly chippedin 18 points,
seven rebounds, ﬁve blocked shots,
and an assist to lead the Panther
barrage. V

Unfortunately for him, as fate
would have it, it was Kelly’s shot
from 25 feet at the buzzer that

could have turned the game into

the biggest win of Pitt’s young
season. The shot hit the front of the
rim and bounced harmlessly to the
floor. ,

The first half saw the Panthers

jump out to an early lead, rattling,

off 12 unanswered points to come
from a 10-5 deficit to a command-_
ing 17-10 lead, and retaining the
margin up to the lastzminute of the
half.

Then came the breakdown, with
the Dukes scoring three quick
buckets to narrow the halftime
score to one point at 38-37.

Part two_ in the intra-city
championship started out much the
same way as the opening period. A
neck and neck, tooth -and claw
battle for the first six minutes
found the Panthers gaining a little
breathing room, taking a 48-45
lead.

But before anyone could say
“Tiger Paul Auslander,” the
Dukes outscored the Panthers,
14-2, taking command of thetight
game, 59-50. Duquesne still held a

, _.
Miller and Dave Reeder would win
so easily against the rest of the
ﬁeld? They did, compiling a total
of 489.8 points (another record) and.
winning by a 36-point margin.

And that’s not all.

The 500-yard crescendo, the
record—shattering event with which
Bradshaw and Lewiswere most
pleased, again ended with Pitt in
first place. This time, Harrington,
DeMuro, Schnepner, Civis and
Steve Leach got together to
establish another record, 4:03.4,
smashing the old one by over two
seconds. Lewis couldn’t contain
his enthusiasm.‘

“Every team stacked this
event,” he bragged. “They all put‘
in their best sprinters and distance
swimmers. We won by almost two
seconds.” ‘

Meanwhile, the three-meter
diving was coming up. Everyone
expected the Pitt diving duo of
Miller and Reeder to repeat the-
performance they gave a few
events earlier. They didn’t
disappoint.

Miller and Reeder again esta-
blished a new record, gaining a
total.of 484.4 points and domina-
ting the rest of the teams.

By now the other participating
teams were sick of looking at the
scoreboard. But was Pitt satisfied
with its accomplishments? ' Of

nine point margin, 65-56, at the
six-minute mark, before the Pan-
thers’ desire was rekindled.

And before Mossie Murphy
could get a word in edgewise, the
Panthers Larry Harris, Tom Rich-
ards. Wayne Williams and Bobby
Shrewsbury chipped in two points
apiece to make the difference one
point at 65-64. A

In the last hectic minute, with
the Dukes on top, 73-71, Shrews-
bury took matters and the ball into
his own hands. Driving toward a
breakaway layup that would have
tied the game, Mickey Davil_a,Ithe
Duke guard, proceeded to instigate

.ﬁi‘

a riot by wrapping Shrewsbury?'~_.‘._§'.

around the basket support.
Shrewsbury made the first of the

. ¢,_..

two—shot foul, cutting the margin to ,

one with 49 seconds left in the
contest. Davila made both ends of
his one and one when_.Terry Knight
fouled out at 34 seconds, making
the score 75-73.

Freshman Williams hit a base-
line jumper at 25' seconds. The
score was now 75-74. After some
crucial turnovers by both teams,
Kelly's desperation shot narrowly
missed, robbing Pitt of a victory.

The Dukes were paced by guards
Norm Nixon and Davila, both of
whom had 18 points, and back-up
guard Lonnie McClain who came in
for Nixon in the second half",
scoring 10 clutch points.

And so, there it was-—seven

championship. And if you don’t
think seven records is’ a big deal,
then try reading them all in one

The relays championship title‘

was a result of team effort. The
victory establishes Pitt as one of
the best in the East.

Bradshaw said. -

But Maryland will get another

in the month.

There's no doubt about it; the

The Pantherette swimming team
placed fourth in the Pitt Invitational
Saturday, taking first place in three
events and accumulating 82 points.

Coming after Friday's upset of
Princeton, Pitt's victories came in
team events rather than the
individual victories that sank the
Tigers. Two relays, the 400-yard
freestyle and 200-yard butterfly,
plus the graduated medley com-
prfsed the Pantherette wins.

So“ Long to Pitt  

(Continued from Paye 12)

In wrestling Dave Adams continues to build a powerful squad as he
keeps picking up a state champ here or a runnerup there as they. too,
keep building.

And finally we come to the strongest Panther team of all. the one I
know the most about. the football squad. What new can be said about
Johnny Majors? He is bright, bold and a deﬁnite presence on the
ﬁeld. Yet he manages to be ‘down home‘ and able to talk with anyone
one-to-one. The only problem with this is trying to get hold of him.

In Tony Dorsett. Majors should have the ﬁrst person to rush for
1,000 yards for four seasons, the leading rusher in the history of college
football next year and—this is a very probable prediction—the next
Heisman Trophy winner. Hang in there “Hawk," don't get hurt and
things should go your way.

But don't count out Elliott Walker and Matt Cavanaugh, who also
put the explosiveness into play on offense. The offensive line was
superb for most ofthe season opening up the holes the backs needed to
spring for big yardage while the defense clawed and fought with the
best and came out on top a lot more often than not.

The only thing for Johnny to do is try and keep the hyperactive
players out ofjail or at least out on bond, or I might have "to suit up for
the Sun Bowl. That might be the biggest mistake since Colorado went
for atie against Oklahoma this year and missed the extra point kick.

Honestly, I wish Coach Majors continued good luck and much
success in the future, but I don't think he will have much trouble
accomplishing it. Just ask Joe Paterno.

Just a word about our esteemed athletic director, Casimir Myslinski.
Now I am not a great lover of the former West Point center, but
regardless of that he has accomplished in a very short period of time
what this University has needed for a long time, a rebirth of good
athletic teams. _

Everywhere one looks it can be seen: swimming, track, basketball,
football and the new emerging power on the campus, women’s sports.
For this reason my hat is off to Myslinski.

Well, that's about it. If you’ve made it to the end with me you are a
glutton for punishment. If you have, and are offended, tough. When
you step down from your position, you can bring in your soapbox and

BY STEVE SYBERT

Following the Pitt hockey club's
5-l conquest of Carnegie-Mellon
yesterday. there was locker-room
talk of acquiring a nickname for
this year's squad.

Junior defenseman Rick Vernon
does not especially like it, but the
Panthers may soon become known
as the "Battling Bullies.” They are
not like the bullies from Broad
Street in Philadelp_hia-—-who most
people call the Flyers——for they
don't go looking for trouble. Then
again, they don't walk away from it
either.

“Our guys are 100% hockey
players," protested Coach Len
Barcalow. “Thesother guys start
the stuff, we don't. But once
something is started, I don't blame
our guys for ﬁghting back."

Pitt racked up 15 penalties in the
game for a total of 46 minutes of
conﬁnement, but the Tartans were
the instigators. Though amassing
only eight penalties for 16 minutes,
C-MU resorted to its usual
unethical style of play.

Vernon feels the penalties didn’t
really matter. “The team played
exceptionally well,” he said.
"We killed all those penalities and
everyone just played super. We're
waiting _now for those New York
teams in two weeks.”

The Pitt Wrestling team
participated in the Penn State

_ Invitational over the weekend,
‘ . ﬁnishing sixth in the field. The

meetwas described by grap Coach
Dave Adams as “...perhaps the
toughest tournament in the coun-
try, next to the nationals.”

Penn State won the team
championship going away with
38% points. Michigan State

indicates,” said Adams. “Rande
was down 3-1, and had to make a
move to score some points, and it
just didn’t work out.”

The toughest loss the Panther
grapplers suffered was Jeff Min-
erd., In his semi-final match, he
suffered a shoulder separation that
will put him out for the rest of the
season. His match in the ﬁnals had
to be forfeited.

“We're going to miss Jeff a lot,

said Adams. “I think we learned
a lot from this meet, and we're
making the progress that 1’ve
expected from these guys. We
have a good, talented team, now all
we have to do is get to work and
correct the mistakes we’ve been
making." .

HORRORS

FROM SCREEN

TO SCREAM

A treasury of the

_ BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Steelers, behind
the running of Franco Harris,
ground out their tenth straight win
...er the surprisingly tough Cleve-
land Browns 31-17. Quarterback
Terry Bradshaw ﬁred touchdown
passes of 3 and 18 yards to Lynn
Swann in the third quarter to bring
the Steelers from a 17-10 deﬁcit to
a commanding 24-17 lead.

The first half of the contest was a
brutal defensive struggle. With
the Steelers on top 7-3, Browns‘

quarterback Mike Phipps drove the
‘team 80 yards to set up Greg

Pruitt’s one-yard burst for the
touchdown, giving Cleveland a 10-7
lead midway through the second
quarter.

On the ensuing kickoff, the
Steeler_’s Mike Collier fumbled,
and Willie Miller picked up the
loose ball and returned it 17 yards
for the TD. With the extra point,
the Browns led 17-7.

The Steelers mounted a come-
back late in the second quarter, but
time grew short before the wiley

-Bradshaw could ﬁnd the end zone.

The Steelers settled for Roy
Gerela’s 32-yard field goal, and
went into the locker room at the
half trailing 17-10.

The Browns were deﬁnitely for

ire

41- I'-

real. but reality ultimately came in
the form of the devastating Steeler
defense. They kept the ball in the
Cleveland half of the ﬁeld for
almost all of the third quarter.
Every time you looked around, poor
Don Cockroft was punting out of his
own end zone.

One of those punts fell into the
waiting arms of rookie punt-
returner Dave Brown, who rambled
down to the Cleveland 10 before
being ‘tripped up by Cockroft.
After a couple of unsuccessful

running plays, Bradshaw foun ,
Swann cutting across the middle 

for the score.

The next Brown attack was cut
off by the NFL's leading pass
interceptor, cornerback Mel
Blount, who picked off number 11 ‘
for the season. With the ball on the
18, Bradshaw ﬁred to Swann again
to put the Steelers ahead to stay,
24.-17. Blount’s 6th interception in
six games is a new Steeler record.

All that was left at this point was
an 8-yard touchdown run by Franco
Harris that put him over the 1000
yard mark for the third time in his
career. Sort of the coup de grace
you might say. The ﬁnal-——31-17.

When it's all said and done, the

Steelers earned this one. And now J

all that’s left is the Steelers’ (11-1?‘:

ilk

match with the Cincinnati Bengals"”"

(10-2) for the ACF Central crown
