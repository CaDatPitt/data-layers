Guy Clafshenkel, former Pitt student, waves a ﬂag at the Kuwait liberation rally in front
of the Federal Building on Saturday. About 30 Bush supporters attended the rally, along
with 10 peace demonstrators protesting them. "We are in support of the troops, the
president and military action in the Gulf," said Chris Hoenscheid.

Pro-peace protesters
arrested downtown

Police arrested 10 people
committing an act of civil disobedience
after a peace rally at Market Square
Saturday.

The 10 people, charged with
obstructing traffic, sat in a circle and
held hands on Forbes Avenue at
Market Square, with supporters on
both sides of the street chanting,
“Support the troops! Bring them
home!” The offenders received
citations and were released the next
morning, according to the Zone 2
police station.

At the rally, Brown University
student Jennifer Adivi discussed her
trip to Iraq, where she and nine
students and professors from America
protested for peace with the Iraqi
people.

Group gives body bags to Senator

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

Twelve people delivered two body
bags to Sen. John Heinz’s office
Thursday morning to protest the
senator’s vote in Congress authorizing
President Bush to declare war.

“This body bag represents the
snuffed-out life of a human being,” said
James Collins. “The calls going into
Washington, D.C., were 10-to-1 in favor
of no war. The calls here were 6-to—1 in
favor of no war. My elected official
[Heinz] failed to represent all of us,
failed to represent his constituents."

Police charged 11 people with
defiant trespass after they failed to
disperse during a peace rally at the
Federal Building on Jan. 17. All were
released the next day with no money
required for bond.

In an act of civil disobedience to
protest allied military action against
Iraq, the group sat inside the building
until after it closed. The police escorted
the protesters to police wagons which
transported them to the Zone 1 police
station.

Three older members of the group,
Ty Luokkula, artist Colleen Dougherty

A and writer Angele Ellis, were released
at 2:30 a.m., Friday, and the rest of the
group was released at 10:30 a.m.
Among them were four people who

Pitt panel debates U.S. involvement in the Middle East

By Jennifer Skriba
Staﬁ“ Writer

Shortly after hearing the news
of the U.S.-led allied attack on
Iraq, a previously scheduled panel
discussion on the use of military
force in Kuwait began
Wednesday.

Although the eight-member
panel was divided in terms of

support or opposition to the war,
all acknowledged that people
should not look at the war in
extremes.

“We all share an emotional and
moral repugnance toward war,”
said Phil Williams, Ph.D., a
professor of international security
in Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.
However, he said there were no

other options other than the use
of sanctions or force because of
the nature of the regime being
dealt with.

Richard Cottam, Ph.D.,
university professor emeritus, said
that removing Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein from power will
not solve problems in the Middle
East.

“What we actually are going to

do is destroy Saddam Hussein.
We have not bothered to think
who will take his place,” said
Cottam. “Settling international
disputes by violence has to be
stopped."

Cottam also said that the Arab
Street, a group comprised of
people in several Arab cities, were
in strong support of Saddam
Hussein. Ninety-six percent of

them oppose U.S. presence in
the gulf, he said.

“Our alliances are with
governments, not with people in
the streets, ” said Laura Eisenberg,
Ph.D., an instructor in
international affairs in GSPIA. She
said the diplomatic arsenal has
been met with nothing but
contempt and the United States

Man tbreatens to /eill Dr. Martin Luther Kingjr. speaker

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Campus police arrested a man Tuesday
night after he threatened to kill Islamic
minister Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, who
was speaking in the William Pitt Union in
commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.’s birthday.

According to police reports, the suspect
placed a call from a pay phone in the
union lobby to the Pittsburgh police’s
emergency number and stated that he was
going to “blow away” Muhammad. Karen
Battle, a 911 communications supervisor,
traced the phone call to the union and
contacted campus police.

Before the suspect made the call, Officer

Ronald Bennett, who was patrolling during
Muhammed’s speech, noticed that the
suspect was yelling comments to the
speaker, some of which were racist. The
suspect left the speech, and Bennett
followed the suspect and saw him make
the call.

The suspect then got into a car parked
in the union driveway and drove away.

Bennett noted the make, model and
license—plate number of the car.

Bennett then saw the suspect return to
the union ballroom with an unidentified
male. The two men remained in the union
for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before
they exited again. Bennett then received
word of the man's threat Making the

Coping on campus...
Graduate school may be solution in tight job market

The word is that the job market
is going to be exceptionally tough
this year for graduating seniors.
Usually when the market is tight,
applications to graduate schools
increase.

Is graduate school an option
you should consider? For students
who have not had graduate school
as part of their “life plan,” this
option bears careful consid-
eration.

If you feel that your own
prospects for a job are good in
spite of the tight market, there are
benefits in gaining some work
experience before applying to
graduate school.

It not only helps you to ﬁnance
your graduate-study expenses, it
may also provide you with a
clearer focus for your career
direction.

If on the other hand, your
prospects for a job seem bleak,
yet your grades are decent and
graduate school figures in your
long—range plans, this may be a

good year to get started.

Before taking this leap,
however, take some time to
review your previous academic
history and to assess whether a
graduate program would enhance
your career goals.

You also need to estimate your
chances of being accepted into a
suitable program. To get some
help with this decision you might
want to talk to a counselor at the
Counseling and Student Devel-
opment Center (334 William Pitt
Union) or the University
Placement Service (224 WPU)
and/or review other career
planning resources available in
these offices.

If after following this
assessment, graduate school still
makes sense, your next task is to
select the school and program
best suited to your needs.

Faculty members can be an
important source of help with
these choices. Information on
graduate programs and on how

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

to handle the application process
is also available in the Career
Resource Center (534 William Pitt
Union).

There are some things that will
require your immediate attention:
selecting the right people to write
your letters of recommendation
and investigating financial-aid
packages for graduate school, for

 

example.

Competition for scholarship aid
at most schools is fierce, so be
prepared for the prospect of
funding at least your first year of
graduate study on your own or
through loans.

Teaching or research ass-
istantships are sometimes
available, but usually these are
easier to obtain after your first
year in graduate school.

If you do decide to change
your immediate career focus from
the job market to pursuing
graduate study, you also need to
remember that students who have
been planning on graduate school
for some time are way ahead of
you in the application process.

You will need to act quickly
and decisively.

Finding the right graduate
program and getting accepted is
hard work, but there is still time
and there are many opportunities
for students who take the
initiative. Good luck!

Allies dominate skies over Iraq, Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia

By J eff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

Seven days into the war in the
Persian Gulf, the United States
and its allies dominate the skies
over Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia with planes and other
weapons.

The Iraqi air force, after its
marginal victory against Iran in
their eight-year conflict, has
suffered heavily under the allies’
saturation bombing. Many planes
could not get off the ground
because the bombing destroyed
airports and runways.

These bombings began Wed-
nesday at approximately 6:37

IN THE GULF

p.m., and have not ceased. As the
raids continued, the allies faced
little opposition from Iraqi
ﬁghters.

Most of the resistance has come
from heavy anti—aircraft ﬁre and
surface-to-air missiles.

The Iraqi people have never
seen anything of this magnitude.
During their war with Iran, air
attacks generally consisted of one-
plane suicide missions, which

turned the pilot into either a hero
or just another casualty.

The allied raids, however, have
shocked the Iraqis. Constant raids
upon Baghdad and other military
installations keep the people in
bomb shelters and out of the
streets. Reports from Baghdad
said that the people are dazed
and confused.

There is the possibility,
however remote, that these
attacks may so demoralize the
people that they will pressure
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
into withdrawing from war.

The allies have been very
successful at keeping civilian
casualties to a minimum. Reports

Analysis

from the Iraqi capital said that
casualties number around 20.

Instead, the allies have
concentrated their attacks at
military installations and
positions. American B-52 bomb-
ers have doused Iraq's most
skilled fighting force, the elite
Republican Guard, with saturation
bombing.

The allies have not been able
to completely destroy the SCUD
missiles. These missiles have kept

the entire Middle East under a
constant state of alert.

Originally, U.S. projections said
that these missiles would be
virtually wiped out soon after the
raids began.

Later reports have said that the
United States may have under-
estimated Saddam’s capability in
this area.

He may have been able to
construct more mobile launchers,
which are more difficult to find
and destroy.

If this is true, these missiles
could lengthen the war by
keeping the allies worried about
the missiles’ existence.

Despite the visible anti-war
movement on campus, members
of the Pitt College Republicans
voiced their support and approval
of last week’s military action in
the Persian Gulf.

“ITheI platform of the
Republican Party is a strong
defense. Most Republicans favor
a strong defensive posture and
an active role in world affairs,"
Robert Lewis, public relations
director for the College
Republicans, said.

Lewis likened Saddam Hus-

sein's ‘atrocities against minorities
in his own country and savagely
attacking his neighbor" to the
actions of Adolf Hitler.

“I don’t see many differences
between Saddam Hussein and
Hitler," Lewis said. Hussein is a
man who, in Lewis’s opinion,
“has to be stopped."

College Republicans President
Todd Jordan not only supports
military action but also accurately
predicted the time of the military
attack based on his own
knowledge of war strategy.

Jordan is optimistic that the
war will not last longer than two
months.

I--" STUDENT

He said that last night’s action
placed the United States at a
military advantage and right now
“Hussein is very vulnerable.”

Jordan “completely supports”
military action because “aggres-
sion should not be ignored."

While he is aware of the strong
anti-war movement on Pitt’s
campus, Jordan said he hopes
everyone realizes that “supporting
troops is beneﬁcial to everyone.”

He added that he would report
fora draft if required.

“Anti-war demonstrators should
realize that they are using freedom
of speech people in Kuwait don’t
have. They have to realize we are

that right,” said College
Republicans Treasurer Kevin
Docherty.

He feels it is “too early to
predict how long it will go on. I
think it will be over a lot quicker
than most people think."

Docherty thinks military action
in the gulf is “justified.”

Docherty said he would go
serve if he is drafted because “it
is the job of the U.S. government
and military to be the policemen
of the world.”

Being drafted does not worry
him because he thinks the crisis
will end in “a matter of weeks.”

Lawyers Guild trains students to give legal advice on war

By Stacey J akubowski

For Tbe Pitt News

The National Lawyers Guild
participated in a training session
at the Pitt Law School to discuss
legal counsel available for people
opposed to war.

“The major thrust of the meeting
was to train law students to give
legal advice or counsel to people
interested in resisting arrest, ﬁling
for conscientious-objector status
or defending people who are
arrested for acts of civil
disobedience or anti-war protest,”
said Connie Rankin, who heads
the steering committee at the Pitt

chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild. “We will do these things
without pay," she said.

The session also included
speeches by Molly Rush andjules
Lobel

Molly Rush, a peace activist,
spoke about local anti-war
marches and rallies.

On behalf of 54 members of
Congress, Jules Lobel, a Pitt law
professor, recently filed a suit
which challenged the president’s
authority to declare war. Lobel
discussed this at the meeting.

However, “the session primarily
functioned to train lawyers and
law students to counsel people

about their options in protesting
the war,” said Rankin.

The Pitt chapter of the National
Lawyers Guild will act as a liaison
between students and lawyers,
Rankin said.

“Students may not know where
to tu m to get questions answered.
If we as law students cannot
provide the answers, then we
can make sure the students have
lawyers to talk to who can answer
their questions,” said Rankin.

According to Rankin, the train-
ing session was arranged as a res-
ponse to the needs expressed to
the National Lawyers Guild by
the Friends Meeting House, an

organization that counsels people
who think they are pacifists.

“Recently the Friends Meeting

House has been getting about
one call a day from people who
do not want to go to war,” said
Rankin, “and the protests are
increasing in intensity and
quantity. If history follows in the
same path, it will not be long
before protesters are arrested.”
Rankin said, “The major
accomplishment of this session
was to train a group of people
who will be ready should the
need occur — and the need is
already starting to express itself
— to counsel people about issues

involved in protesting war or
becoming a conscientious
objector.

“For example, if someone came
to us saying, ‘I cannot go over
there and kill people,’ then we
would tell them about the options
legally available to them,” she
said.

information about the services of

the National Lawyers Guild can '

Pitt students Justin Ahren, Tina
Howard, Bill Pettit and Ellen
Dorsey.

During the night, a support
group of students from Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon waited
in the lobby of the police
station for the release of or
news about those arrested.

Trespassing

Members of the support group
thought that the protesters
received a more serious charge
than was expected. A group
arrested onJan. 15 at the Software
Engineering Institute had been
charged with summary offenses.
but this time those who were
arrested were charged with
misdemeanors.

"[The people arrested] were
prepared," said Pitt student Liz
Berlin. “They knew the risks of
being arrested twice in the same
week. [The charge] was a little

higher than we hoped for, but
it is within the realm of what
we expected."

To pay any fines, a support
group took a collection at the
rally and at a Pittsburgh
Students Against the War
meeting, raising approximately
$275. Other events may be
held to raise money, according
to Berlin.

“A lot of people were upset, ”
said Berlin, “but a lot of support
was shown. It was a strong,
supportive night.”

Analysis
Continued from page 3

In other war news:

olraq, living up to its pre-war
promise, has attacked Israel twice
with SCUDs since the war started.
Approximately 17 Israeli citizens
have been wounded, none
seriously, in these attacks.
However, several have asphyx—
iated in their gas masks.

Tel Aviv, where three SCUDs
have landed, was most seriously
damaged.

Saddam has been attempting
to drag Israel into this conﬂict to
drain Arab support for the
coalition against him. With Israel
as a participant, Saddam believes
that the Muslim countries will
turn against the other allies and
instead fight their common
“enemy,” the Jews.

Despite the pounding,
however, Israel has refused to
retaliate. Upon U.S. request, the
Israelis have kept their distance
from the conﬂict. But unless the
missile attacks cease, this position
could change.

-Small—arms fire was reported
Saturday near the Saudi-Kuwait
border. Squad—size reconnais-
sance patrols came across a group
of Iraqis. No injuries were
reported.

0 Four Americans were slightly
injured Saturday in an exchange
of artillery fire. The fighting was
contained to a small region near
the Kuwaiti border.

-The allies reported that 13
allied planes have been shot down
so far. The Iraqis, however,
reported that 177 allied planes
have been destroyed.

Both sides have also displayed
the first prisoners of war. While
the Americans have played down
their POWS, Iraq has ﬂaunted
them, parading them through the
streets and taping interrogations
for the American public to hear.

Saddam has now said that these
POWs will be placed at military
installations and used as “human
shields” in an attempt to stop
attacks.

Disobedience

“In Iraq we discussed the
possibilities of peace between
our countries,” said Adivi. “Of the
people we talked to, they do see
a chance for U.S.—Iraq peace
settlements.” Adivi left Iraq on
Jan. 14, the day before the U.;\'.
pullout deadline.

During the march Adivi and
four others carried a banner that
she received from the Iraqi peo-
ple. lt read in English and Arabic,
“Peace and Justice for All.”

The rally also included students
who arrived after walking from
the William Pitt Union.

“We are told that we do not
support the troops. But we do
because we want them home
safe. That is how we support the
troops, not by sending them to
possibly die," said Rick Adams,
state chairperson and local co-
chairperson for the Rainbow
Coalition.

Another speaker at the rally
looked ahead to the possibility of
the reinstatement of the draft

“I want you [the students] to
find out where the draft board
is," said local activist Vince Eirene.
“We will go to that building and,
brick by brick, we will tear it

must compensate for failed

Eisenberg said sanctions
would not work. “If anything
will make Saddam Hussein
change positions, it is fear, not
hunger,” she said.

However, Joshua Epstein,
Ph.D., senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, said that
the United States had not yet
exhausted all its alternatives.

“We don’t know sanctions
will fail. If there was ever a
case these would be met, I
think it is this case," Epstein
said. He said the burden of
proof lies on people who will
expend thousands of lives
before exhausting all options.

According to Epstein, U.S.
casualties could run as high as
16,000 per month in intense
operations, and it is possible
tens of thousands will die

before the war is over.

“Could I look at people
whose family members have
died in the war? Could I say
they died for a vital interest of
the United States, andlevery
avenue has been exhausted? I
couldn’t," Epstein said.

Joseph Eaton, Ph.D., of the

sociology department and
GSPIA, said that the US. action
in the gulf has been well
thought out.

“I don't think there has been
a war in American history
where so much thought has
been given —— over five and a
half months,” said Eaton. “I
think the reason we had to
enter this war was to make
clear that state terrorism doesn’t
work. There is no defense
unless the world community
unites to control this weapon
—- the weapon of state
terrorism.”

Robert Hazo, Ph.D., director
of special seminars, said that
President Bush has made the
situation in the gulf worse.

“Bush personalized the
conflict by calling Hussein a
liar," Hazo said. According to
Hazo, the worst thing you can
do to a Third World leader is
to shame him in front of his
people.

Hazo said he believed
economic sanctions would
work, eventually bringing the
Iraqi economy to a halt. “One
year of embargo would be
much cheaper than one week
of war,” he said.

Keep the war in Iraq...

Anti-war protesters are always something our generation
associates with history books, nostalgia and Time/Life
photo essays. Modern America is fascinated by the ’60s,
but our generation hasn’t experienced a feeling of similar
urgency until now. The events of recent months have
given us our own chapter to write in the history books.
And across campus, children of the ’80s are facing a major
war for the first time —— in very different ways.

Today's protesters march in the shadow of their ’60s
counterparts. In the past month, anti-war protesters --
students and non-students alike —‘—— have been ubiquitous.
Although the interaction between protesters and supporters
of President Bush has been peaceful in Pittsburgh,
considerable hostility and disrespect has been directed
toward protesters, particularly since bombings of Iraq
began last Wednesday. A lot of the hostility comes from
people who think that the protests of the ’60s tripped up
the military during the Vietnam War and lowered morale,
causing the United States to lose the conﬂict, and indirectly
causing the deaths of many American soldiers.

Whatever one’s views on the war are, the protesters
deserve respect. They are not traitors, anti-Americans or
finger—pointing demagogues. They are people with
legitimate questions about a war that affects their lives.
They are exercising their right to free speech and given
their respective consciences, they are being the best
Americans they can be —— just like the soldiers in the
Middle -East.

It also ‘important to note that the protesters have been
very verbal in their support of our troops and have
objected specifically to President Bush’s decision to go to
war. We commend the protesters for saying, “Love the
troops; hate the war.” With this kind of attitude, we can
trust that the soldiers returning from Iraq will not meet the
apathy, antipathy and ingratitude that Vietnam vets faced.

The American people, whether they are for or against
the war, have supported the troops in several practical
ways. They have given blood and sent letters and care
packages during the troops’ long and lonely stay in the
desert.

At a time of crisis it is good to know that many U.S.
citizens are willing to be active, whether in support of
Bush or in protest against the war. Our country was
founded on the principle of free speech, a right increasingly
important during a crisis like the one we face now.

Episodes of violence have ﬂared in certain locations in
America over opinions about the war. In some of our
larger cities, physical confrontations and vandalism have
erupted. On Pitt’s campus, while the spirit of activism
continues to flourish, we are hopeful that proponents and
opponents of Operation Desert Storm will not allow such
ugliness to be a part of their agenda.

 

Pro -war activists speak out

Letters

be over for all intents and purposes
by D-Day + 72 hours (the length
of time it will take the [U.S. Air

in the Middle East to speak up.
For weeks now, we have sat back and listened to
those who have demonstrated and protested over
the entire campus. Despite the relative silence of
we who support the president's policy in the
[Persian] Gulf, our views are no less worthy of
attention.

Having lived with the beneﬁts that this country
offers, one should show some support for
governmental policies, regardless of one’s fears for
personal safety. Those who, for religious or other
moral reasons, cannot support violent action by
the government, have the right to express their
views. However, those who protest‘ merely for
something to do are beyond contempt.

The ignorance of these protestors is evident For
example, their use of yellow ribbons, traditionally
symbolic of loved ones being held captive or
serving in hostile areas, as -a symbol of protest is
unthinkable. Additionally, their methods of using
entertainment to draw large crowds is offensive. If
these people were truly dedicated to peace and
against armed conﬂict, then fun would be the last
thing on their minds.

The right to demonstrate and protest against the
government when it is in the wrong has always
been a, right of the American people. However,
draft dodging has not. Students on this campus
should be learning how to support their
government, not undermine it.

Don't turn war into propaganda battle

Over the past several months The Pitt News has
printed a seemingly endless number of one-sided
and outrageously uninformed articles pertaining to
combat against Iraq. l...l

My greatest sticking point I have is with your
continuous “reporting” of how terrible and costly
in lives a war would be. I know personally that no
one on The Pitt News staff has the slightest idea
what modern warfare, technology, etc., can do to
limit friendly casualties. You suck up the pabulum
offered by over-aged hippies and moral pacifists
(truly unbiased news sources) that conflict would
cost many thousands of American dead and maimed.
Then you expect the readers to believe this
nonsense. That isn't journalism; it's propaganda!

A war with Iraq won’t last long enough to require
a draft; it won’t mean another 55,000 wasted lives
as in Vietnam, and it certainly won’t lead to an
American defeat. Take this as gospel from someone
who dow understand warfare. The Iraqi War will

After that Saddam Hussein has one of two choices
to make -— slaughter his own starving, thirsty, ill-
supplied forces in a last—ditch counterattack or
surrender his hold on Kuwait. To keep his power
in Iraq, he must do the latter. It is as simple as that.
Rest assured, GIs and British T ommies will be

U.S. must take out Hussein now

I am writing to ThePittNew5 in response to all the
anti-war and anti-bloodshed demonstrations and
similar activities happening on campus this week.
I truly agree with these activists and don’t want to
see the loss of human life, whether it be American
or Iraqi. But, however noble their efforts are, they

seem to be overlooking a very important variable in ’

the equation.

Our activists against American intervention in the
Persian Gulf look at our roughly 500,000 military
personnel sent by President Bush as epitomizing
American greed. However, they have forgotten that
there has been a true democracy struggling for
survival in the Middle East for the past 42 years,
right in Saddam's [Hussein] back yard, and has
overcome many obstacles, to do so. With the threat
Saddam poses for Israel he is threatening the United
States as well and democracy the world over.
Everyone would like to see a peaceful solution to
the Middle East crisis, but in order to preserve peace
and tranquility in the world,.sometimes we have to
make sacrifices. Sometimes quite large ones.

If we pull out of the Middle East tomorrow and
leave Saddam in power to do as he pleases, we're
going to be some sorry activists down the road. It
seems that we must get rid of him and his domination
of the Arab world now or get‘ rid of him later at
higher cost. With today's technology, he could have
possession of nuclear warheads, in addition to the
chemical weapons he already possesses. The only
democracy in a strife-ridden area could be history
-— not to mention the damage he could do to the
West.

I truly believe that our presence in the [Persian]
Gulf is justified. Whether we are there for the
reasons I have stated or not remains to be seen. l...l
It is interesting, though, to project what the outcome
of the Holocaust would have been if there had been
oil ﬁelds in Eastern Europe during World War II. l...l

Double decker...
Lady Panthers whip two

teams from the tri—state area

By Arthur Graziani
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team had great
success this weekend, scoring victories
over Ohio State and West Virginia. Pitt’s
record now is 7-2, with one more dual
meet remaining next weekend at Villanova
before the Big East Championships. ,

On Friday Pitt hosted Ohio State and
literally overmatched the Lady Buckeyes.
The Lady Panthers had almost three times
as many swimmers as OSU, and with that

@" much depth Pitt had no problem attaining

a 137.5-96.5 win.

Because this was the last home meet of
the year, the seniors on the team were
honored with a small ceremony before the

meet. Head coach Dave Belowich gave‘

the seniors a rest during most of the meet
and gave a few of the younger swimmers
a chance to get some much- needed
experience. One such participant was
freshman Jennifer Burns, who had one of
the best meets of her career, winning the
50-yard freestyle and the 200-yard
backstroke.

Another freshman standout was Candie
Burke, who placed third in the 400
individual medley with 4:43.78, Pitt’s best
time in the race. Also, sophomore Clare
McShane turned in a stellar performance
for the seniors, winning the 200 freestyle
and placing third in the 100 free.

As the last race approached, Pitt was
already secure in a win, so the seniors got
a chance to swim together for the last time
in the 400 freestyle team relay. Although
the team didn’t win the race, senior

Theresa Picklo and Liz Sari, along with
senior divers Diane Chmielewski and Krissa
Ratliff, have left their impact on Pitt teams
of the past, present and future.

On Saturday the Lady Panthers faced a
much tougher opponent upon traveling to
West Virginia. Unlike the previous day,
Pitt was matched race for race against the
Lady Mountaineers, with both teams at full
strength.

From the very beginning, Pitt had an
uphill climb. The Lady Panthers fell behind
early, losing five of the ﬁrst six races. The
only victory was in the 1000-yard freestyle
by sophomore Jill Comeau. Coach
Belowich realized that the women had
dug themselves into a hole. “We definitely
started off slow, ” he said. “But on the other
hand, some of those second and third
places we got in the beginning helped so
that we had a chance to come back.”

The momentum started to go Pitt’s way

when junior Christine Gallagher wonthe
100—yard freestyle with a time of 53.68. In
the 500 freestyle, Pitt took first, third and
fourth to vault up just behind WVU in the
scoring. As the last race approached, the
women knew they still had a chance. The
Lady Panthers realized with a win in the
400 relay, they could win the meet.

The race itself was close. The swimmers
on each team pushed as hard as they
could, with West Virginia gaining a slight
edge after three legs of the race. But senior
Celeste Makiel moved up on the Lady
Mountaineer, and going into the last lap
they were dead even.

The West Virginia crowd, very strong in.

By Ryan Buncher
Stajf Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team scored its third victory in

four road games against the Big .

East as it came back from a 13-
point deficit to defeat Boston
College on the road. The win
raised the team’s record to 10-7
overall and 5-1 in the Big East.
Boston College led 35-30 at the
half and extended the lead to 47-
34, with 15 minutes and 24
seconds remaining. “They were
running," said Pitt head coach

Kirk Bruce. “They broke our press.
We switched to man-to—man
[defense] and did all right.”

Pitt did more than all right,
going on a 17-3 run capped by a
three-pointer by senior forward
Lorri Johnson with 10 minutes
left, giving Pitt a 51-50 lead.

After Boston College retook
the lead, freshman center Carolyn
Miller hit a layup with 4:16
remaining in the game to put Pitt
ahead to stay, 64-63.

Johnson led Pitt in scoring and
rebounding with 28 points and
nine boards. Sophomore guards

Maureen McConnell and Lisa
Fessler and senior center Connie
Hurt all scored 10 points.
McConnell also led the team in
assists with four.

Sarah Behn of Boston College,
who entered the game second in
the Big East in scoring, averaging
23.7 points-per-game overall and
23.5 against Big East competition,
topped all scorers with 30 points.
Carla Wenger scored 18.

“She is a great player," Bruce
said of Behn. “It was important
for us that we didn’t send her to
the free-throw line. We only sent

her there once. “

Behn leads the Big East in free-
throw percentage with a 92.6-
percent mark.

Pitt returns home to face St.

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team opened its season this past
weekend when it traveled to
Williamsburg, Va., to meet up
with the Tribe of the College of
William and Mary. The Lady
Panthers lost 184.65 to 182.65.

Both head coach Debbie
Yohman and assistant coach Ben
Rovee were proud of their team’s
performance. Yohman said that
in her five-year career at Pitt,

she has never had an opening
score as high as this.

One of the many fine
performances was that of senior
Carrie Camesale, who earned a
37.25 in the all—around
competition. Camesale came
back from a knee injury that
took her out of competition
before last year’s season.

During Sunday’s competition,
Camesale earned three career-
high scores in the all~around,
the vault (9.50) and the floor
(9.3).

The Lady Panthers held their
own on the vault this weekend,
scoring a 45.90, while the Tribe
scored a 46.50. “Our vaults are
average, and we performed our
average vaults very well,” said
Yohman.

Turning in strong
performances for the Lady
Panthers were Camesale (9.50),
Gina Venezia (9.20),. Kathy
Wallish (9.15), Kristen Brown
(9.05), Tina Taylor (9.0), Karen
Jorgensen (8.90) and Jen
Butkovich (8.85).

The Lady Panthers displayed
a strong standing on the uneven
parallel bars (45.85), while the ‘
Tribe earned a 45.4. “We hit
seven for seven, which is the
first time that’s happened since
I’ve been at Pitt,” said Rovee.

Rovee was proud of the
performances turned in on bars,
mainly because he is
instrumental in the team’s
training in that event.

Turning in fine performances
for the Lady Panthers were

Brown (9.45), Taylor (9.40),
Jeannie

Vecchio (9.10),

 

Camesale (9.05) and Wallish
(8.8).

“That was T ina’s career high,”
said Yohman. “Tina's weakest
event has always been bars, but
they weren’t weak on Sunday.”

The Lady Panthers turned in a ,
strong floor performance, but
not as strong as usual. The Pitt 4
squad scored a 45.95, while the

Tribe scored a 46.40. “We had

Strong supporting cast anchors 1991 gymnastics

By John Labriola

Sta_[f|V1-tier

When gymnastics fans go to watch the
Pitt women's team this year, they will see
what should be Coach Debbie Yohman’s
strongest team in her five-year reign at Pitt.

Yohman returns eight of last year’s
squad as well as four of last season’s
injured gymnasts, while gaining one
freshman.

The Lady Panthers ended last season by
placing sixth in the Northeast National
Collegiate Athletic Association Regional
Championships with a record of 7-8, and
8-15 overall.

This season, however, the team is starting
out on the plus side of the board. According

lg to Yohman, all of the Lady Panthers have

shown a great deal of strength and
determination.

Six of last year’s strong competitors will
be key members of the squad.

Kristen Brown, a sophomore from
Jefferson Boro, Pa., will be returning to
her role in the all-around competition.
“Kristen right now looks like she’s going
to start out the year as our top all-arounder, "
said Yohman. “Right down the line she’s
better than she was last year.”

Last season Brown was scoring as high
as 37.15. She also broke the school’s
balance-beam record with a score of 9.65.

Jen Butkovich, a junior from McMurray,
Pa., will be returning to the all-around
competition as well. Butkovich was out

for most of last year with mononucleosis.
“Right now she is not ready to compete all-
around,” said Yohman. “I see her ready to
compete in bars?’

Butkovich was one of the Lady Panthers’
strongest parallel-bars performers last
season, but an elbow injury took her out
of the lineup. She was the Lady Panthers’
top vaulter with a score of 9.4, a score
achieved against West Virginia University.

Karen “BatKate”Jorgensen, a sophomore
from Boyertown, Pa., will be coming back
into the Lady Panthers’ lineup after having
foot surgery. Jorgensen is one of the Lady
Panthers’ strongest ﬂoor performers.

She scored a consistent 9.5 last season in
the floor exercises. Jorgensen’s routine is
done to the music from the motion picture
Batman and is especially thrilling to watch.

Tina “Big Dawg” Taylor, a senior from
Charleston, W.Va., will be competing in
the all-around event this season. Taylor
owns the school's ﬂoor-exercise record.
Last season, Taylor tied her own score of
9.7 and is expected to do it again this
season.

Gina Venezia, a junior from Pittsburgh,
will once again return to the all-around
competition. Venezia broke the school's

beam record last season and will be

working with a new beam performance.
Kathy Wallish, a senior captain from
Hummelstown, Pa., will be a major part of
the Pitt squad. Wallish went the entire
season last year without a fall. “You could
always count on her before; she’s ready to

go now,” said Yohman. “Boy, she’s on a
roll-, she’s hot.”

Re-entering competition this season are
four injured-reserve competitors.

Coming back from a knee injury that
took her out of the lineup early last season
will be senior Carrie Carnesale from Goleta,
Calif.

Carnesale was competing as an all-
around competitor before her knee injury,
and Yohman says that Carnesale will be
competing in that capacity this season.

Suzzie Coast, a sophomore from Beaver
Falls, Pa., will be making her collegiate
debut this weekend. Coast underwent
knee surgery during her senior year of
high school and did not compete during
her freshman year at Pitt. At present, Coast
will be the Lady Panthers’ alternate on the
vault.

“She will be a very good seventh person
for us,” said Yohman.

Tracy Jung, a junior from Flemington,
N.J., injured her ankle near the end of last
season. According to Yohman, Jung was
doing great this season, but doctors feel
she may have a stress fracture in her foot.

Jeannie Vecchio, a senior from
Pittsburgh, will be retuming to the all-
around this season after suffering from
tendinitis in her foot. Yohman feels that
Vecchio could be the Lady Panthers’ top
all-arounder if she lives up to her potential.

The team’s newest performer is Meg
Johns of Pittsburgh.

Johns comes to the Lady Panthers with

a unique tale. During her senior year, she
had an emergency append€CE0mY-

She talked to Yohman over the summer
but had to be talked into coming out for
the team. According to Yohman, Johns
had received no rehabilitation after her
operation and therefore was out of shape.
“She could not do a single sit—up when she
walked into our gym,” said Yohman.

Johns is now ready to compete in the all-
around competition. According to Yohman,
Johns is a quick learner and a hard worker,
which makes her an essential part of the
team.

Three performers who will be missed
this year are senior Robyn “Bird” Borchers,
sophomore Beth Dyson and sophomore
Kim Miller.

.Borchers has been complaining of sore
feet and has decided to retire from
competition.

“I thought it was real hard for her to

make that decision because she felt real ~
bad,” said Yohman. “She felt like she was »
not doing her job — letting the team

down.” i‘

Although Borchers will notbe competing
with the Lady Panthers this season, she
will be supporting them from the bench as
the team’s manager.

Kim Miller, a sophomore from
Sroudsburg, Va, will miss this season after
suffering a knee injury last year. Yohman
says that Miller needs this year to rebuild
her confidence level. ’

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 22, 1991
 

Hockey club breaks losing streak  

Byjohn Labriola
Staﬂ’ Writer

It was both a barn burner and
a backyard brawl. The Panther
hockey club broke its nine—game
losing streak with the Ice Dukes
of Duquesne University this past
Friday night by defeating them 6-
3 at the Neville Ice Complex on
the South Side before the
Panthers’ largest home crowd this
season. On Saturday night the
Panthers lost to the Mountaineers
5-0 in West Virginia.

On Friday the Dukes started
the game off with a goal scored
only 45 seconds into the

competition and set the pace of

the game. The Dukes’ celebration
was short—lived, because one
minute after they scored their

goal the Panthers netted one of

their own. Scoring for the Panthers
was Rich Skalosky, with assists

ﬁoing to Dave Koval and Andy
Ross.

Much of the game was played
in the Panthers’ own zone by a
short-handed Pitt squad. During
the course of the season, the
Panthers’ penalty killing has
improved. They were able to
hold the Dukes’ power-play line

from scoring for the majority of

the period.

The Dukes managed to break
through the Panthers’ line and
score their second goal of the
evening with five minutes

 remaining in the period and

closed the _scoring at 1-2.

but at the end of the race Pitt
pulled out the win with a
time of 3:37.42, just three-
hundredths of a second faster
than WVU. Makiel said she
couldn’t hear the crowd.

PITT BITS: Lorri Johnson leads
the Big East in scoring, averaging
24.7 ppg overall and 26.8 against
Big East opponents. She is also
fourth in rebounding overall with
8.9 boards per game and first in
games against the Big East with
10.8 per game. Her recent streak
of 33 straight free throws, which
ended Jan. 9 against Villanova,
was a team record. Connie Hurt
leads the Big East in average
shots blocked per game with 2.5.

The second period opened with
the Dukes holding a power play
over the Panthers’ heads, but this
was to be Pitt’s period. Pitt
managed to hold down both its
penalties and its tempers — but
barely.

As the period progressed both
teams seemed to be exploding
on the ice. The Panthers began to
take control of the ice and refused
to let the Dukes score a point.
Five minutes into the period the
Panthers scored their second goal
of the game. Netting the goal was
Bill Crousey, with the assist going
to Steve Karas. The Panthers
quickly regrouped and netted
another goal 40 seconds after
Crousey’s goal. Scoring the
Panthers’ third goal was Chuck
Rose, with assists going to Eugene
Barilla and Ross.

With 44 seconds left in the
second period, Ross set Crousey
up for a shot on goal. Crousey’s
shot was deﬂected off the crossbar
for a power- play goal. At the end
of the second period the Panthers
held a solid 4-2 lead.

Pitt was unstoppable during
the third period. Koval scored an
unassisted goal one minute and
six seconds into the period to
widen the Panthers’ lead over the
Dukes.

During the course of the third
period the Panthers earned eight
penalties, which left them short-
handed for much of the period.
This allowed the Dukes to score
one more, only to have the

Panthers retaliate with one last
goal, to close out the scoring for
the night at 6-3. Scoring the
Panthers’ final goal was Crousey,
with the assist going to Barilla.

On Saturday the Panthers
headed south to meet up with the
Mountaineers of WVU. According
to Koval, the Panthers’ team
captain, the Pitt squad members
did not seem to have their minds
on the game. “I think that
Duquesne game Friday night took
a lot out of us," said Koval, “but
I’d definitely rather beat
Duquesne and lose to West
Virginia than beat West Virginia
and lose to Duquesne.”

Marc D’Amico, the Panthers’
goaltender, played the entire
game on Saturday even though
he was injured while warming up
before the game. While D’Amico
was stretching, he was hit in the
head by a stray puck. “One of
their pucks came ﬂying down
and [hit] him on the side of the
head, and he was bleeding
everywhere,” said Koval.

According to Koval, the game
came down to whoever had the
best goaltender. “It was the
league's best offense against the
league’s best defense, and this
time the defense won,” said Koval.

“We were able to hold them to
three goals, and they were able
to hold us to none,” he added.

Wednesday the Panthers will
be hosting the Penn State West
Saints at Golden Mile Ice Center.
Faceoff is set for 10:30 p.m.

Dave Martin, who won the 500

dual meet and that no one should
get overconfident. “I was pleased
with the swim,” said Martin. “But
I’m looking forward to the Big
East as far as having ‘big time’
competition.”

The highlight of the day for Pitt
was the performance of junior
diver Phil Cruz. Cruz took first
place in the 1- and 3-meter diving
competitions. He also qualified
for the NCAA diving prequals
later in the semester.

Cruz, who was expected to

qualify for the prequals, knew he *5

season. “The pressure was on [to
qualify], this being one of the last
meets, so I’m really pleased.”
Next week the swim team faces
its last dual meet a gainstvillanova
before the Big East
Championships. Assistant coach
Mark Davin feels his swimmers
are ready. “They’re looking real
strong right now,” he said.

Continued from page 3
University departments have been
asked to appoint representatives
to an acadernic-affairs committee,
which will deal with foreign
teaching assistants, teacher
evaluations, computer availability
and various aspects of academics,
according to SGB member Gil
Golden.

SGB member Andrew Gould
announced that Tower A, Lothrop

Hall and Oakland Avenue will be
trial areas for the Crime Stoppers
program. Crime Stoppers, started
by last year’s SGB, will involve
student volunteers working with
campus police to reduce crime.

Extending shuttle services into
North Oakland and expanding
the shuttle’s evening hours to
accommodate nursing students
are other proposals being worked
on by the SGB.

PSAW

Continued from page 4
Organization for Peace so we can
spread what happens there
around Pittsburgh.”

When asked what the group
hopes to accomplish at the march,
Oblak said, “Peace; we hope to
accomplish peace.”

Oblak also stated that PSAW
supports the soldiers, not the
war. PSAW is planning a blood
drive to help the soldiers.

“I want students and anyone
else who reads this to know that
we are supporting our troops.
We are afraid of what the troops
might be hearing and what they
feel. We want them to know that
we are behind them and are
trying to help them.

“We're planning to have a blood
drive and in the next few days

we’ll be organizing it,” Oblak
said. “We want the troops to
know that our prayers and souls
are with them.”

Student reactions toward the
group going to Washington were
mixed.

James Sheeder, a Pitt student,
approves of the idea.

“I think it’s a really good idea.
The way that they are giving a
lower rate to people who can't
afford it is a good idea also.

Mikael Rosciola does not
oppose the march, but he doesn't
think it will do any good.

“I think it’s too late; the war has
already started. The president
already made up his mind, and I
don't see where an outside
inﬂuence will change it,” said
Rosciola.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 22, 1991 S

 

IT’S YOUR MONEY 

Questions to ask before you put it down
on a Spring Break Trip:  

1. Has the on-campus representative ever been to this destination?
The Pitt Program Council HAS BEEN GOING TO DAYTONA BEACH FOR 5 YEARS. We know
p the area very well.

2. Has the on campus rep. ever stayed in the advertised hotel?
SEE #1... We’ve inspected the majority of the beach hotels —— we know which are ﬂea bags
& what hotel policies are.

3. Is the on campus rep. making money on this trip?
The Pitt Program Council does not make any money on your trip -- we know you work
hard for your $ — we guarantee the highest quality for the lowest price.

4. What is your satisfaction rate?
The Pitt Program Council Daytona Trips have a satisfaction rate of 98% over 5 years —— we
know because we follow up! (We have Canadian student newspaper articles detailing
problems with the competition. Ask to see them.)

5. How can you guarantee where we will stay?
The Pitt Program Council has a letter from Howard Johnson’s that guarantees rooms for
students on our trip — ask to see it!

6. What can you tell me about the busses?

The Pitt Program Council has a letter from Lakefront Trailways that guarantees Wide
Body, MCI Model 102 coaches with VCR & Stereo. (Hint: bendable busses have a difficult
time going up hills — double-decker busses have very little headroom for people taller
than 5’ 5” -— 70 passenger busses are always bendable or double-decker.)

7. Will I have to stop on the way to Daytona Beach? .
The Pitt Program Council Trip stops only for meal breaks & driver changes — we know
you want to get there quickly. (Hint: other trips stop at other schools if the bus is not
filled to maximum capacity — WE DON’T COMBINE!)

8. Did you sell a Spring Break Trip last year? Will you be here next year?
The Pitt Program Council has run Spring Break Trips for 5 years 8: will continue to do so.
(Hint: other companies HIRE STUDENTS ON A COMMISSION BASIS — they have no vested

interest in the welfare of Pitt Students —— they’re only in it for the money!)
