Honors Plan-A Plus

 Associate ProvostSays

.\.l

W

 

BY MAGGIE McKAY

The recently proposed University
honors program will enhance Pitt’s
ability to attract and hold high
caliber students and faculty mem-
bers, according to Associate
Provost David Powers.

“The honors program will
provide an excitement that’s been
missing for a while,” Powers said.
“It will have a positiveimpact on
high school counselors and ‘parents
who advise students where to come
to school. We’ll also be able to ﬁnd
teachers who really want to come to
Pitt who really care about an honors
program.” '

. Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye views the
honors ‘program as one way to
brighten Pitt’s image in the eyes of
students, faculty and the commun-

I ity at large.

“Pitt is suffering from a poor
self-image. We do have a problem
of an , undistinguished reputation.
We’ve doneiinothing to stop it. The
honors program will be worth trying
if it raises our self-image,” Moye
said. '

Students who attend prestigious
schools, according to Moye, have a
tendency to persist in their studies.

“Some schools are prestigious in
reputation so people there -work
themselves real hard. Many a
young person would work himself
40 hours week at Harvard but only
20 hours .a week at Pitt. It’s

ridiculous, ” Moye said.

The reputation of any institution

is determined by the people it .

graduates both directly and indir-
ectly, Moye said. A

“You can’t fool anyone.» If you
give ‘someone who can’t read a
degree, it hurts the person, the
school and the people who come
after him,’7 he said. “It bothers me
when I talk to people downtown and
half the executives gripe about the
skills kids have. But when our own
faculty at Pitt ‘say skill preparation is
unnecessary, those evaluating the
product of the institution have a low
opinion.”

 



Worrledpto  over the  cost of.»'a decent

Though the quality of students at
Pitt can be improved, according to
Powers the quality is not as poor as

, some people believe it to be.

“I think we have a lot of bright
kids here and have no reason to be
ashamed of their caliber,” Powers
said.

There has also been a tendency,
for some faculty members to sell
their students short when it comes
to quality, according to both Moye
and Powers.

According to ‘Moye, the honors
program, along" with the recently
approved faculty teaching evalua-
tions, is an idea whose "time has
come at Pitt. -

“This is -one of the few times
where the issue of quality has been
seriously discussed. It certainly
feels good to know our faculty and
others are now talking about the
quality of education,” Moye said.

- “We want to improve the
ambience of the campus at large,”
Powers said. “The honors program
will help both students and faculty.
It takes energy to teach an honors
course and hopefully this energy
will spin off into all of the

participating faculty’s classes, .

stimulate thinking and revitalize all
their teaching.” .-

Original '5 Owner

Police Harassent Charged

BY PETE DICKS

Original Hot Dog Shop owner
Sidney Simon claims his recent
seven-day liquor license suspension
is the indirect result of “selective
law enforcement” and “harass-
ment” by local police. -

The license suspension, which
began February 22 and ended
yesterday, stems from‘ a violation
which occurred last summer when
Original Hot Dog Shops, Inc. of
3901 Forbes Ave. sold beer to
minors.

Simon, whose license has been
suspended before for the same
offense and who has been fined in
the past for exceeding the 144-ﬂuid
ounces of beer per sale limit,
contends his establishment has
been singled out by local police.

. “You’ve got 30 or 40 bars in a
radius of 10 blocks of here, and if the

Oakland police wanted to enforce_

the law, they could probably bust
every bar every night of the week,
so why do theypick on the Original?
Nobody’s fooling nobody, that's
what you call selective law
enforcement,” Simon said.
Pittsburgh police officer A.
Ludovico, of No. 4 Oakland station,
sees the problem relating more to
the fact that much of the Original
Hot Dog Shop’s business is for
carry-out beer. “You’ll see gangs

of kids loaﬁn’ on the corner, you'll

Grad Students Air Concerns

BY BETSY NORMAN

Pitt Graduate students brought
their growing needs and concerns to
the attention of Chance1lor,Wes1ey
Posvar at a closed meeting Monday.

The student committee included
members of the Graduate and
Professional Student association

(GPSA) and the Union of Graduate
Employees (UGE). _‘

The meeting, held at the request
of UGE, a student organization
designed to work toward the

unionization and collective bargain-
ing rights of the graduate employes,
was ‘organized through GPSA. The
Chancellor was advised by his legal
counsel that a m_ee_ting with UGE
would in effect constitute recogni-
tion of UGE, which is not an official
Pitt organization_, according to John
Quatroche, assistant secretary to
the ‘Chancellor. ,

The graduate students reported
to the Chancellor areas of concern to
the students. Former GPSA
Chairperson Sandy DeBourelando

suggested the University investi-
gate the possibility of on-campus
graduate housing.
‘DeBourelando spoke in terms of
both long-range plans for housing
.and short term, temporary housing.
She suggested the use of Bruce Hall
as temporary housing, "which is
currently being used to house
international students as well as the
ofﬁces of various student organiza-
tions. She mentioned the possibility
of purchasing Forbes Pavilion,
located at the corner of Forbes Ave.
and .McKee Place, for use as
housing. .

“The Chancellor considers hous-
ing for graduate students an urgent
problem and there are some specific
proposals under con‘sideration,”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg said about the
meeting. Rosenberg was present at
the meeting.

“The Chancellor said he would
explore the possibility of on-campus
graduate housing, and he listed this
as one of Pitt’s top priorities,”
Quatroche, who was also at the
meeting, said. “The problem is,
though, there has always been
continuous concern in the commun-
ity when it came to the building of
more student housing facilities.”

While Simon admits that minors»

area as posing a problem. “-When i V

BY BETSY NORMAN

In one of its most revolutionary
decisions of this decade, the U.S.
Supreme Court, in 1973, granted
women the right to an unconditional
abortion in the ﬁrst trimester of
pregnancy.

The two cases, Roe v. Wade and
Doe v. Bolton, led to the expansion
of the privacy doctrine and stated a
woman has a constitutional right to

. choose, in consultation 'with her

physician, whether or not to abort
her baby. However, this right is not
absolute.

While there can be no laws to
interfere with a women’s right to an
abortion in the first trimester—the
ﬁrst 13 weeks of gestation—there
can be restrictions later in the
pregnancy.

In the second trimester, from
about the 13th week until viability-
about 25 weeks, the government

can institute regulations to protect

maternal health, including restrict-

ions on licensing the facilities and
personnel. During the third
trimester, which begins at the point
of viability, the Court held that laws
prohibiting abortion altogether can
be passed to protect the state’s
“interest in the potentiality’ of
human life,” but these laws must
make exception for the preservation
of the woman's life and health,
including her mental health.

“That decision was revolutionary
in a sense. It simply said that a state
couldn't limit abortions in the ﬁrst 3
months,” Ellen Doyle, executive
director of the Pittsburgh American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said
recently.

Various other questions arise
concerning abortion, including the
issues dealing with spousal and
parental consent. Just last year, the
Supreme Court, in the Planned
Parenthood of Central Missouri v.
Danforth case, held it is unconstitu-
tional for states to require the
consent of a married woman's
husband as a prerequisite for
abortion. The Court said since the
state held no veto over an abortion
in the ﬁrst trimester, it may not
delegate such power to a spouse.

"But this refers only to the first

trimester. The Court’s opinion
offered no view concerning spousal
consent after the 13th week.

The Court also ruled out the
requirement of parental consent,
using the same reasoning as in the
above mentioned case. It held no
blanket provision may be imposed
requiring parental consent for

minors. The Court stated,
“constitutional rights do not mature
and come into being magically when
one attains the state-defined age of

’, -. maturity. Minors, as well as adults,

are protected by the Constitution
and possess constitutional rights.”
It reasoned that when a teenage
daughter and her parents are
opposing each other over an
abortion, giving the parents abso-
lute veto power would not “enhance
parental authority or control,” and
said, “any independentinterest the
parent may have in the termination
of the minor daughter’s pregnancy
is no more weighty than the right of
privacy of the competent minor
mature enough to have become
pregnant.” _
Other court rulings concerning
abortion state that a woman can be
required to give her consent in
writing before an abortion, that
private hospitals do not have to
perform abortions and in most
cases, public hospitals can be forced
to perform abortions upon'request.
The question dealing with public

hospitals is a complicated one. The
courts have consistently ruled
neither administrative inconven-
ience, staff unwillingness, nor
community opposition is sufficient
justification for a public hospital to
prohibit elective abortions if it
offers analogous obstetrical-gyn-
ecological services (ob-gyn ser-
vices) such as full-term deliveries
and “therapeutic” abortions.

Another question dealing with
public hospitals arises when a
public hospital that offers ob-gyn
services claims none of its medical
staff is 'willing, on religious or
conscientious grounds to perform
elective abortions. The question is
whether or not such a hospital can
be forced, through a requirement to
provide the community with
abortion services, to hire non-ob-
jecting physicians and nurses and
other personnel required to staff
such services. This question still
has not been answered, and the
Supreme Court will hear the case, ‘
Doe v. Poelker, this term.

An important side ‘question

concerning the advertising of
abortion clinics was answered in

one of the Supreme Court decisions

concerning abortion. A state
statute prohibiting such advertising
was deemed unconstitutional by the
U. S. Supreme Court due to
violation of the first amendment.

“Now that women have an
established right to privacy, this can
be applied not only to abortion, but
also to voluntary sterilization,”
Doyle said. “The Court has decided
that the choice to be sterilized rests
with the woman alone.”

The consent of parents or spouse
cannot be required to obtain a
sterilization operation, nor can one
be forced to undergo such an
operation, except in the case of
mental incompetency.

There are no restrictions concern-
ing contraception under Pennsyl-
vania law. Neither parental consent
nor spousal consent is required.
One dges not need to be over 18
years of age to obtain birth control

legislature.” Williams said he had
been in touch with the University
lobbyist Thomas Lamb concerning
an effortwhich would concentrate
on one-to-one contacts with key
state legislators. ‘ ’ . ‘

“Steve has a very good approach
to the problem,” Quatroche said.

Graduate student researcher and
FAS representative to GPSA Bob
Nelson presented information re-

garding salaries of graduate’

employes throughout‘ the country at
the meeting, and said Pitt has
consistently been on the bottom of
the list. Nelson cited statistics‘
showing Pitt graduate employes
were being paid up to $1,600 less for
comparable jobs at the University of
Florida and listed Pitt as paying less
to graduate employes then the
University of Michigan, in addition
to many other schools including

- Penn State, another state supported
_ school.

At the meeting College of Arts
and Sciences academic advisor and
history department representative
to Faculty of Arts and Sciences-
Graduate Student Organization
Peggy Renner spoke about the
working conditions at the University

and said if working conditions were

improved, the quality of education -

would be improved. To improve
working conditions, ‘she advocated
an expan'sion of Pitt’s Affirmative

‘Action programs, child care facili-

ties, health care programs and
expansion of counseling services.
“She presented a full agenda of
things,” Quatroche said. “The
basic reaction of the Chancellor was
that it would be great to do all. those
things. There were basically three
levels of response by the Chancel-
lor. The first level is that what Pitt is

doing it is doing well; secondly what .

Pitt is doing should be expanded‘
and improved; and three, that some
of her proposals were ﬁnancially
unfeasible. ’ ’

so. .She feels there is a national
trend toward unionization and

‘Selective Enforcement’

(‘Continued from Page 1)
while of the Original a Hot Dog
Shop's customers, he said, “It’s
mostly all transients, kids from
different neighborhoods, it's not
the students at Pitt. Actually I’d say
90 percent of the troubles we have
are not with the students at Pitt.”

Simon expressed little optimism
about the effects of the suspension,
Saying. “When we get our license
back. we're gonna get busted again;
it's just a matter of time because
we're being harassed by Oakland
police. Why? lhave no idea. maybe

because we don't believe in the free

we don’t feed them, or maybe_

’cause we're the big mover of beer

Officer Ludovico reiterated that
there is not selective law enforce-
ment for liquor violations at
Oakland bars; rather, he felt that
laws were being enforced ,where
they were being broken, adding, ‘‘I
don't know why he's hollering about
being harassed; any trouble we

large and prestigious universities
across the country are leaning
toward unionization.

UGE filed a petition with the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board (PLRB) in 1974, requesting
an election to determine if graduate
students wanted UGE as their
collective bargaining agent.

PLRB is still trying to- decide if
graduate employes are covered by
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act
195,, which covers unionization.

“I think the Chancellor was very .

synipathetie with the concerns of
the graduate students and em-

Chancellor did say that he wants to

 A Necessary Program

The creation of a structured honors program within the University will
. contribute an increased academic excellence and help eliminate Pitt’s
image as a scholastic also-ran among major universities.

College is a time’to further one’s secondary education. 'Ihis applies
not only to those who perform below the level currently accepted as the
academic norm, but to those above this level too.

It is the responsibility of a well-rounded University to provide
instruction for those who need it to catch-up to and succeed at this norm.
And it is also a responsibility to provide a higher level of instruction to
those who ﬁnd little challenge in their course load from term to term.

A University Honors Program (UHP) will accept this responsibility
and provide the instruction. To have it administered by the College of
Arts and Sciences will insure excellence in the program across
departments, and maintain a quality comparable to similar programs at
other schools.

Unfortunately, an honors program often has the connotation of a
special favor project created for an elite group set apart from the rest by
a superior intelligence quotient. But UHP will be nothing of the sort. It
will give the student something he deserves for the tuition money he
pays——the chance to choose the academic level at which he wishes to

work. A

To make sure that the honors program will not be regarded as a core of
elitists, the administration must not forget the needs of the student
majority toiling at the academic norm. Advising programs for them are
in dire need of improvement. These students must not be shut out of the

nors courses, either. There must be open enrollment; even if they
don’t qualify for the program, students must be given the opportunity to
enrich themselves one course at a time. ‘

Administering this program will require budgetary support from
CAS. And this is a tough time to spend money, even on the necessary
things. UHP will have to adhere to the same stringent allocation rules '

other departments and programs follow.

However‘, there is no question of its necessity. UHP, like Pitt’s
Community Education Program, should have been an integral part of
this University years ago.

Give to Solve Puzzle

Greek Week is next week and one activity that is part of this annual
event is a six-week charity drive which concludes March 11.

The American Cancer Society was selected as the charity this year and I
along with can collecting on street corners, fraternities and sororities
have staged beneﬁt events to solicit funds for this worthy charity.

Basic cancer research is expensive, and inﬂation hits it too. Labora-
tory rats cost five dollars and up, depending on the breed needed.

T -Chemicals required for the synthesis of experimental drugs cost tens of

 dollars per gram. Equipment like electron microscopes, high speed
centrifuges and scintillation counters cost tens of thousands of dollars.
And the human element. the brains behind the solution. have years of
training invested in doctoral and post-doctoral work—-you can't rent
their creativity for minimum wage.

To make a contribution through a friend in a fraternity, or sorority will
not only give the 46 weeks of the year they aren't collecting for charity
some redeeming social value but also bring man one step closer to the
cancer answer.

to do so are shedding the coat of
hypocrisy—not religion. A person’ s
real religion is more like his skin,
which he wears every day in every
situation, including the classroom.

So there is something funda-
mentally wrong with public educa-
tion. The fact that state-related
universities are promoting reli-
gious perspectives shouldn't both~-
er anyone—they can't help it. On
the other hand. these same
universities have effectually barred
certain other religious perspectives
from the academic scene. And
that, if religious freedom is really
valued, should bother everyone.

. Pitt's cross-registration program
offers students the opportunity to
study at ‘ Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary. but no credit is given for
courses in theology.’ Yet students
are welcome to accumulate credits
in capitalist. socialist. evolutionist.
or absurdist theology at any
participating school. For example,
perspectives on man’s environmen-
tal and human relationships are
basic to any theology. Capitalism,
evolutionism and the rest all make
statements of this sort. Should we
allow some statements and struc-
turally disallow others?

More important than the cross-
rcgistration program is what goes
on right here at Pitt. l can‘t speak
for people of every faith. but I've
been pretty frustrated in the search
for courses taught from a Christian
perspective. l know of only one.
and I'm told that the instructor has
been warned about his teaching.

Again. I can get all I want of
capitalism. socialism. evolutionism
and several other un-Christian
approaches to the various disci-
plines. but information leading to
the development- of Christian
perspectives is sadly lacking at
Pitt. Such information is lacking
not -because it is non-c.xis’tent. but

in as

system has failed to recognize that
all thought reli_gious—not just that
which goes under the name of an
institutional church.

(It ‘should be recognized that
when I emphasize the need for
Christian perspectives on aca-
demics and theoretics I do not
mean plugging personal. moral
values into appropriate sockets.
Not lying and not stealing are part
of Christian economics. for in-
stance. but so are the concepts of
stewardshipiand justice. 7 These
latter two elements require atten-
tion from Christian economic
"theorists and students at the
highest levels; advanced. applica-
tion of these concepts cannot be
learned in Sunday school.)

So ' the’, approach to public
education that seeks to eliminate
religious inﬂuence on academic
work has failed. and has instead
resulted in an abridgment of many
people's religious freedom. The
tax money of many Christians.
Jews and others goes to support
the secular religious perspectives
taught in the 'public schools. but
those same, citizens and their
children must ‘attend privately-
funded. often prohibitively expen-
sive. institutions if they are to learn
according to their faith.

Three ways to remedy the
situation come immediately to
mind. 

‘One approach would be to
expand the different departments
in the state universities and include
in them course taught from the
perspectives currently unrepresen-

ted. This would be difficult. if not.

impossible. The present ﬁnancial
status of most institutions prevents
such a solution and the difficulties
involved in representing each and
evcr_v religious perspective would

be monumental.

and staff their own learning
centers. Education funds could be
distributed according to a religious-
ly qualiﬁed demographic break-
down; public institutions could
serve those indicating no prefer-
ence. Problems with this approach
include the danger of creating
isolated, educational ghettos, as
well as the difficulties mentioned in
connection with the first sugges-
tion. .

Though one of the above
solutions might eventually be_
ideal—-if the problems can be
solved—l think a third approach is
currently the most viable. Public
monies in justly determined
amounts, could be set aside for the
purpose of funding religious

alternatives within the public,

schools. These funds would be
made available to groups deemed
qualiﬁed according to agreed upon
criteria and could be used to hire
appropriate instructors. Members

of the religious groups. desiring"

representation would be respon-
sible for initiating action and
ensuring academic integrity.

At Pitt. this would mean that
Christians. Jews and other reli-
gious groups could learn about
language. economics. science. en-
gineering and other disciplines
from their. own perspective rather
than from some‘ sccularistic point of
view.

The practical problems involved

inproviding educational alterna-V

tives_ require detailed attention.
They are not insigniﬁcant. but they
are also not insurmountable.
Whatever new approach is best
from a practical standpoint——one
of the three above or another-—-the
status quo must fall if we're to have
‘ a just educational svstem.

Which way now?

Foreign Policy's Direction

BY CHRISTOPHER BREWER

The first foreign policy of this
country was, essentially, not to have

a foreign policy. Avoid “entangling.

alliances” cautioned Washington,
and heeding his words, in 1823
James Monroe’s Doctrine estab-
lished an important precedent.
“Our policy in regard to Europe. . .is
not to interfere in the internal
concerns of any of its powers.”

Such a course of action was
prudent at the time; it allowed the
young nation a chance to grow and
mature. The trouble is that our
leaders today are unable to chart a
consistent and rational course in
foreign affairs. The country’s
maturity has cut loose from the solid
moorings of Monroe’s 150-year-old
doctrine.

Over the past few decades,‘ we
have alternately supported and
opposed democracy, socialism,
fascism and monarchism. At one
time we thought our policy was
Communist containment. So we
intervened in Korea. But then we
failed to intervene in Eastern
Europe. And after failing to "stop
Communism in Cuba, we ‘spent a
decade ﬁghting it in Vietnam. We
have consistently violated one of
Napoleon’s most basic maxims
“International incidents should not
govern foreign policy, but foreign
policy, incidents.”

One factor behind the lack of
_continuity in our foreign policies is
the electoral system and our
changing of leaders every eight, if
not four, years. New leaders simply
take new directions. _ But while most
of us are willing to live with this
situation, it is nonetheless worsen-
ed by a misunderstanding of foreign
affairs on the part of the American
public. ~

“An appalling ignorance of
foreign affairs is one of the most
strikingand dangerous defects of
American public opinion,” writes
historian Thomas A: Bailey.
Americans simply have little sense
of the customs, priorities and values
of other peoples and other cultures.
Thus our leaders, responding to the
will of the people, perform in an
often rough, uncalculated, high-
handed manner. “Yankee," the
world cries, “go homel” A

Against that background now is a
month-old presidency which has
announced to the world that a
concern for human rights will guide
U.S. foreign policy over the next
four years. Remember, President

Carter is essentially untested in
foreign affairs.

But shades of Metternich, what
activity! Over the last few weeks,
Carter envoys Walter Mondale,
Cyrus Vance, Andrew Young, Clark
Clifford and Ellsworth Bunker have
been off to Europe, the Mideast,
Africa, Cyprus and Panama,
respectively, while Carter himself
dined with Canadian Prime Minis-
ter Pierre Trudeau at home and
corresponded with Soviet dissidents
inside Russia. Didn't this man
campaign on domestic policy
issues?

And what’ is this human rights
doctrine? On the surface, it appears
very credible; who‘ can argue with
utopian ideals? But does it meet the
essential test of balancing available
resources against national security
and economic interest priorities?
Or is it an easy way to go, another
zag in the zigzag history of
American foreign policy?

One State Department official has
recognized, “We’re trying to keep
an awful lot of balls in the air.”

Giving Carter full credit, the
human rights apprqach, along with
such things as the appointment of
Andrew Young as United Nations
ambassador, may be calculated to
improve relations with the Third
World. Perhaps the U.S. has begun
to recognize the economic and
military potential of these develop-
ing countries and views this
potential against the decline" of
European economic and military
power and the demise of NATO.
The Third World may one day hold
the balance. of power in the palm of
its hand.

For the time being, the doctrine is
certainly an appeasement. Carter
seems to be saying to all parties in
trouble spots everywhere that the
United States recognizes their
interests and will attempt to protect
them. Proving that U.S. security is
a function of world-wide peace, we

~ have gained ground.

But what happens if the United.

States is forced to choose, to rank
the human rights of one particular
group over another? Does not
recognition of the human rights of
black Rhodesians to black majority
rule violate a white Rhodesian’s
sense of human rights? Carter has
already drawn Soviet ﬁre with his
letter to Andrei Sakharov, for
meddling in the internal affairs of
the communist giant.

Still in its embryo form, we can
only hope that the human rights
doctrine will bring much-need_ed
structure to American foreign
policy. Sidney Harris has observed,
“You can have a foreign policy only
when you know who you are and
what you want to be.” Well, the
U.S. is top dog and needs to protect
that ranking.

If human rights can for the
present bring peace to the world
through U.S.-negotiated comprom-
ises we will have taken a step,
though plans for steps that follow
are needed. _

What is most worrisome in the
end is the tone of Carter's
pronouncement. Hopefully, he is
not playing Sunday school teacher
for the whole world, for if so, the
U.S. will again come off high-hand-
ed, in yet another mis-appreciation
for other peoples and cultures.

Idi Amin has already told the U. S.
to worry about its own human rights
problems. Love, peace and
brotherhood make good religion.
They can even help a small town boy
rise to the Presidency. But they
cannot make a‘ foreign policy. The
U.S. needs to set out realistic goals,
develop a strategy for achieving
them and not just exchange the blue
uniform of the world’s policeman
for the black robe of the world’s
preacher.

decided. The only decision yet to be
made is whether our type of
employment falls under the juris-
diction of the PLRB, as outlined in
Pennsylvania Public Employees’
Act 195.

The situation in which Pitt TA’s,
TF’s, GSA’s and GSR’s find
themselves, where no governmen-
tal agency is ready to sponsor a
collective bargaining election for
them, is not an unprecedented one.
Labor laws and the various
governmental boards which enforce
these laws have come into being
only when unions already are
functioning and ﬁghting for collec-
tive bargaining with employers.
Until 1971, any public employe
in » Pennsylvania—nurses,
hospital workers, welfare workers,
as well as teachers—was not
allowed by law to unionize. But in
the mid 60’s,_ groups of public
employes like the Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia school teachers began
to unionize and bargain collectively
in spite of the law. Act 195 was then
passed in 1971, once it was clear
that publiciemployes wanted
unionization. In short, labor laws
changes when workers’ activities
change.

Graduate employe unionization is
a relatively new phenomenon. And
that’s why the PLRB has to rethink
the whole idea of public employee
unionization, so that our state labor
laws can once again reflect employe

' activities.

Yet all this takes time. The UGE
requested that the FAS-GSO
sponsor ‘an election because we
believe that graduate employes at
Pitt want a union now. We are not

content to wait for another four or I

ﬁve years until Pennsylvania labor
law catches up with labor reality.
UGE urges all TA’s, TF’s, GSA’s
and GSR’s in FAS to spend the next
month learning all they can about
unionization in general and about
the UGE in particular so that they
can participate in the March 23 and
24 election as fully-informed voters.

Th Crematory Man:
‘Me and the Devil’

BY KEN GORMLEY

The practice of cremation is
nothing new. Since the beginning
of time, men have burned their
deceased loved ones. (Some
over-anxious civilizations didn’t
even bother waiting until their loved
ones were dead.) '

But today‘, cremation is taking on
a new importance. These days,
there just isn’t enough space to
_accommodate every person who
decides to drop dead.

To make matters worse, the cost
of a decent burial is skyrocketting.
.It’s no wonder more and more
people—worrying themselves to
death over these problems--are‘
choosing to solve everything by
going upin one quick puff of smoke.

As I walked through the gatesof
Homewood Cemetery—which

houses one of the four Crematories.

in Pittsburgh—I ’assured myself
there was nothing to be afraid of. It
would all be over with one quick puff
of smoke.

The crematory was an old,
‘castle-like building. I twisted’ the
giant iron handle, swung open the
door and stepped into a dark,
marble corridor. ,

The sound of my footsteps echoed

- ominously off the walls as I headed
towards the dim light of a lamp that
ﬂickered ahead.

Then, I spotted them—three
giant. furnaces. An old guy with a
stocking cap half-covering his wild
black hair sat beside the first
furnace. He was hunched over a
pile of large white chunks—they
looked like pieces of plaster—and

was scooping them into a Crisco.

can.
“Excuse me, are'_you Jimmy?”
The unshaven face slowly peered
up at me, and a thin smile crept
across the man’s’ lips.
right. You must be the fellow who’s
gonna help with the cremation.
You're just in time.”
_ . Jimmy slid the Crisco can into a
corner.

“We might as well get
started. I'll finish these remains
later.” '

Remains? You mean...? My

Quick—what religion started in
1973 and now owns the New Yorker
Hotel, the Tiffany Building and
Manhattan Center in New York and
the Jordan Marsh Mansion in
Boston? Another clue—this
institution ~ grossed $40 million,
tax-exempt, last year.

The Uniﬁcation Church, headed
by Sun Myung Moon, a Korean
refugee since 1973, was the subject
of “The Students Confront Rever-
end Moon and the Occult,” a recent
speech by Rabbi James Rudin for
the Pittsburgh Section National
Council of Jewish Women and B’nai

stomach twisted itself into a knot as
I shot a glance at the white chunks
sitting at my feet. To think that a
few days ago these ashes had
been. . .It sickened me to think about
it. '

THE CORPSE

As if to fill his role as the.Master
of the Crematory, Jimmy walked
with alieavy limp. He led the way
back to the receiving room—a place

that looked like a little church——_

where relatives of the deceased can
hold services.

In the middle of the room sat a
golden metal casket—just deliver-

ed‘.‘You don't have to take the body
out of that, do you?” I asked, m
voice shaking. '
“No. We burn the casket, too.”
Whew! Was I relieved. I wasn't
really in the mood to...

“But we take the lid off, so the _

body will burn better,” Jimmy
added. He calmly ﬂipped’ open the
casket, undid a couple of screws and
slippedthe lidoff. I couldn’t bear to
look.

The nauseating smell of funeral
parlor ﬂowers filled my nostrils.
“Let’s wheel this over to the
furnace,” he grunted.

My heart was pounding furiously.
I forced my eyes down—to the
upper rim of the coffin, to the white
silk bedding and, ﬁnally, to the pale
white face inside. It was an old lady.

We rolled the casket over to the

’ opening in the brick-lined oven and

Jimmy positioned some little pipes
in the furnace so the box would roll
right into the middle.

_ I didn’t know how much longer I
could take looking at the gaunt,
white-haired face lying below me. I
started pushing the metal box into
the furnace.

“Not so fast,” Jimmy said,
propping his elbow on the rim of the
cofﬁn. “Can’t get started for a few

minutes—pollution regulations.
Might as well ask me any questions
you have.”

What a time for an interview, I
thought. The poor old lady wasn’_t
going to like this one bit.

“How did you ever get into this
line of work? ’ ’ I asked, nonchalantly
staring at the ceiling.

— “Well, I walked into this place 27
years ago, looking for a job. I

'couldn’t do no heavy work,

understand, cause of my hip. Well,
they needed someone to do ‘the
cremations, so I took the job."
“Didn_’t it bother you—working
with dead bodies and all?”
“Hell no, son. When I was a little
kid, I lived next to a mortician. Me

and crawl all over the bodies-
didn’t know any better, understand.
So I’m used to it.”

But I wasn't. A few more
minutes, I thought, and I’d need to
ﬁnd myself a bucket. “Listen, can't
we get on with the cremation?”

“Anything you say.”

INTO THE FIRE

Jimmy called in_ some help-
two guys who were painting the
ceiling in the next room. We lifted
.up the casket and slid it into the
furnace.

One of the helpers pushed a
button and the old lady disappeared
from sight as a metal door slammed
down and sealed the vault.

“It’ll take about two hours for the
body to burn,” Jimmy explained,
ﬂicking on an after-bumer. “And
the rest of the day for it to cool off.
We won’t be able to touch it till
tomorrow morning.” ‘

He handed me a pair of asbestos

and my playmates used to sneak in

   

gloves. “Put these on so you don't 
get shocked. You wanted to help, 

didn't you?” ~
I nodded half-heartedly.
“Okay. Turn the gas on.”
Poor old lady, I thought. She'd

probably ﬂip over in her casket if 
she knew she was about to go up in a V,

blaze and drift out over Squirrel Hill
like a cloud of smog.

With a ﬁrm tug. I pulled the 

lever—almost as far as it would go.
Flames shot into the oven with a
roar and licked every inch of the
casket.

Within a few minutes, the poor
old lady was sitting in the middle of
a 1,300-degree incinerator.

Two thousand years later, a third

not say he is the third Adam, but his L

followers believe he is.

Rev. Moon's following could be
classified as another cult movement
Rubin contended, if families were
not being torn apart. “The target
group for the followers is 18~3O
year-olds, overwhelming white
middle-upper class from a strict
religious background who are
disappointed with their churches,”

' he said. “Members of the church

approach someone on the streets
and say, ‘Are you happy?’ The
person is then asked out to dinner
and introduced to the Unification
Church._

Rubin said he investigated the
solicitors, who sell things for the
church’s funds, at airports, street

jcornersfand bus stations. “A team -

Rubin talked about the breaking
of family ties. ‘ ‘Emotional bondage
is cutoff. Moon is the true parent;

the others are just natural parents. .

Sometimes the members are
allowed a telephone call home.
When we bring these people home
they need psychological help in
breaking the dependence on
Moon,” he said. ‘

Parents wishing to “steal” their
children from the Moonies are not
allowed to do so because, Rubin
said, it is a violation of civil rights.
Rubin said the reason these people
prefer to follow Moon is the failure
of the churches.

Rev. Moon came to the U.S. in
1973, ﬂeeing prosecution from the
North Korean government. He had
been educated in Presbyterian
schools in Korea. Former President

’ NEW McCART

A Secret Report

On November 1, 1976, Dr. Gilbert Shapiro of the
Pitt Sociology Department sent a secret report entitl-
ed, “Communism, Marxism, McCarthyism and So-
ciology” to the FAS Tenure and Promotion Review
Board. The board was reviewing the Nyden firing.

This report is one of many on the Nyden case. The

A others still remain secret. Our question is: Do they all

look like this one?

The Tenure and Promotion Review Board, which is
the only level in the appeal process at which faculty
input takes place, reviewed the Nyden case for al-
most four months. They recommended to Dean Je-
rome.Rosenberg that an ad hoc committee of Pitt pro-
fessors be set up to review Dr. Nyden’s scholarly
work. No member of the Sociology department could
be on this committee; the implication being that pro-
fessors like Dr. Shapiro are obviously politically bias-
ed. Dean Rosenberg, however, totally rejected their
recommendation. I

As you can see from the following excerpts from Dr.
Shapiro’s report, the Nyden firing was based upon
political, not scholarly, grounds.

“In his testimony before the-FAS panel on October 8, Nyden
seems to have repeated the claim that I had made ‘McCarthy-
ite’ attacks upon him on March 10, I976, andquoted me as
uttering the sentence, ‘Never fire a communist. ’ He also quoted
statements of mine which had been tape recorded, he says, at
a student occupation of Burkart Holznér’s office on March I6.
These statements have been distorted by the manner in which
they are quoted, in the same spirit as the claims about the
‘last Marxist faculty member, ’ and to the same end: Nyden’s

Come to the Rally-

I

case is that he was fired for being a ‘Marxist. ’ To make it plau-
sible he must show that we are the sort of people (‘McCar-

thyites, ’ or on other occasions ‘red-baiters’) who would not

tolerate ‘Marxists ’ in our midst.

“The incident occurred at ameeting of European historians
at David Sabean’s house, to discuss the work of Visiting Pro-
fessor Dorothy Thompson on ‘The Changing Image of Work-
ing Women: I800-I850. ’ The meeting. came in the midst of
the first burst of political mobilization over the steering com-
mittee decision to recommend against N yden ’s renewal, and I
arrived late at the meeting, which began at 8:30 p.m., after a
thoroughly exhausting and frustrating day attempting to
chase down and refute what seemed like an infinite flood ru-
mors. I felt then, as I do now, that we have been subject to
attack in a (highly professional media campaign reflecting the
skills that develop in a relatively small group able to share
experience over decades spent in mobilizing hundreds of such
efforts. After the conclusion of discussion of Thompson ’s pa-
per, the gathering shifted to a social tone. In describing the
day's trials,- I did, in fact, say ‘Don ’t ever fire a Commun-
ist."—in a spirit of hyperbole. Of course, I did not ’mean
this literally. One ‘fires’ whoever needs it regardless of his
convictions. This was my way of saying that we were go-

- ing through the very‘ difficult experience,-_ for which acad-

emic men are hardly fitted, of attempting to defend our-
selves against a skillful, .-devious, orchestrated. disciplined.
and devoted politcal sect.

.. “Why did I refer to N yden on this occasion as a Communist?

The answer must be clear:'because_ that is what I thought he

Here Is What an Informer’s Report Looks Like g

On February 16, an all-day public hearing on “Dis-

. criminatory Practices at Pitt” was held in the Student

Union. Among the more than 50 people who testi-
fied, was Dr. Paul Nyden, recently fired by the So-
ciology Department.

Two days later, this informer’s report was circulated
in the Sociology Department. While that department
has contended that the Nyden firing was not political-
ly motivated, its Chairman has refused tocondemn
this report. ‘

Who hired this informer? Who“ else did this person
report to? Is this what the-University of Pittsburgh

has come to? To us, this demonstrates, once again,
the growing McCarthyite mentally on our campus.

Here is the informer’s report. Aside from everything
else about it, it is full of distortions. There were 200
peopleat the hearing, not 30. Channel 4 television was
only one of many news media covering the event.
Members of the citizens’ panel were not acquainted;
most had never met one another before that morning.
The statements attributed to Dr. Nyden are totally
misquoted. Henever said that he has a copy of the 14-
page secret report;-nor did he‘ ever say. “Research
takes away from teaching.”

Western Penitentiary inmates

prison routines last Sunday after-
noon. ,

Nathan Davis and the Pitt Jazz
Ensemble donated their time and
musical expertise to fill the
penitentiary’s auditorium and the
ears of those inmates in attendance

, with what is probably the best jazz

available in Pittsburgh.

Playing before an audience of
approximately 700 of the 1030
inmates incarcerated in the omin-
ous federal pen, Davis and the
ensemble gave a lively perfor-
mance, featuring the music of such
jazz greats as Eddie Harris, Miles
Davis, Count Basie, Herbie Han-
cock and Stanley Turrentine.

The ensemble found a receptive
audience who showed their appre-

‘ciation for the lyrical respite with

enthusiastic applause and an
occasional standing ovation.

In fact, considering the ensem-
ble's infectious beat—and contrary
to one guard’s prediction—the
musicians were better received than

Year of the Cat
Al Stewart
Janus JXS-7022

In many ways, Al Stewart is like
Bob Dylan. Like Dylan, Stewart
writes all his own material, plays
guitar and sings. His music is
essentially acoustic; he adapts
many rhythms and sounds from a
variety of musics, molding them
together from a mild rock perspec-
tive.

Also like Dylan, .Stewart is
sqmething of a balladeer. His
songs, although not as down-to-
earth and literal as Dylan’s,' are all

It's where Stewart parts from the
Dylan tradition, though, that he

After listening to ‘ ‘Year of the Cat. ’ ’
it is apparent that Stewart can reach
and manipulate music at ﬁne and
delicate depths that Dylan has yet to
plunder.

many hours of_ working and
reworking.

The tracks are uniformly com-
plete and integrated. Stewart
doesn’t just blend the different
instrumental strands together, he
weaves them into ‘intricate patterns
with the precision of a symphony
conductor. In fact, the arrange-
ments on “Year of the Cat” are
symphonic in quality; each. instru-
ment is optimally on course and
well-at-home.

Stewart is also an adept lyricist,
able to work in the ballad mode
without being bound by its rather
rigid prescriptions. Never mun-
dane, excessive, or self-indulgent,
he has given more breadth and
scope to this age-old genre than a
generation of artists before him.

.”Casanova”:~ Lush But Boring

BY M.c. PILECKI

'.Probably the first word that
comes to mind after seeing Fellini’s
“Casanova” is “disappointing.”

Theﬁlm is certainly lush—sets
and costumes are opulent in the
extreme—but the plodding plot
ranges from raunchy to boring.‘ It’s
one non-erotic scene of‘ sex after
another, each duller than the next.
One, perhaps two of them, threaten
to be humorous, but they’re so
overdone they quickly lose even that
promise.

Franks Hits on
Breezy Formula

BY M.D. KAMBIC

Michael Franks ~
Sleeping Gypsy
.Warner Bros.

BS 3004

‘ ‘When I hear stuff like this I want
to go down to the beach and relax, "
was a response of a Michael Franks’
fan on listening to Franks’ new
release.

Well, there are no beaches near
enough to run down to after hearing
Michael Franks “Sleeping Gypsy”
but you can lean back and play it
again if you liked it that much. The
album_ is the follow up to Franks’
successful “Art of Tea” album and
it is better.

The new album starts out on side

one nice, slow and easy, like a’

breeze coming off a beach, with
“The Lady Wants To Know.” The
highlights in this song emphasize
the strength of the album: smooth
saxophone solos with the kind of
professional backup musicianship
that is so refreshing to the
ear-—.eve_n if you don't like the lyrics
orvocals. ‘ ‘ i- ' ‘ ’

 

the kind of voice that is distinctive
enough to make the separate tracks
melt into one long-playing song
with only the rhythms and moods
varied. If you like his voice—the
one that cranked out “Popsicle
Toes” three million times on AM
radios last spring—you’re on your
way to loving this album.

And what of Franks’ lyrics? Some
are heavy, some are ‘cute,’ but
again, they are distinctively Franks.
Remember “Love is monkey-see
and monkey-do” from “The Art of
Tea?" This time its ‘Love is a chain,
it’s just a chain reaction” and “Love
is always just like hide-and-seek.”

There is also a soft, Latin

‘atmosphere inﬁltrating the mood of

many of the songs on this album.
“B’wana—he no home” and
“Down in Brazil" were in fact
recorded in Rio de Janiero. Other
songs refer either in lyric or beat to
Latin, but it is a mistake to call
Latin the over-riding musical
influence on the album.

Franks borrows a little Latin

incidents occurred, one guard
remarked that the tight security was
necessary for the protection of the
musicians.

Once, he said, a few inmates
staged a knife ﬁght after a concert
and jeopardized not only future
concerts, but also the prison’s
relatively unstructured audience
control efforts.

Looking back on the situation, the v

same guard also remarked, “Only
about 10 percent of these guys

really enjoy the concert, the rest of _

them are here only to see the girls. ’ ’

If what this guard said has ‘any
validity, the ensemble did not
disappoint the crowd. The concert

The Casanova legend is about a
not overly attractive Venetian
gentleman who attains sexual
heights because he " supposedly
understands the female spirit. ‘He
played up to that, thus serving both
his partner and himself. Fellini’s
alleged lover has as much ﬁnesse as
a drug store hood, who is not above
stooping to rape to appease his
appetites. He is more narcissistic,
wrapped up in his sensitivity, and
managing to ﬁnd women eager to
serve him. There’s no spirit of
“conquest” in his sexual exploits.

The ﬁlm is rather muddled in.

upon his intellectual triumphs-

recites poetry to try to establish his
reputation as a romantic." But he
does all this inia wildly decadent
atmosphere that was ‘appropriate
and highly effective in Fellini's
“Satyricon,” but here it’s merelv
excessive and often out of place.
The 18th century simply wasn’t this
much fun.

What is left is a loose collection of
some occasionally impressive im-
ages,- but in a sort of underdone
stew. The film is choppy, with
(perhaps intentionally) little sense
of time, and is frequently hard to
follow. There is little plot—just

Jazzy—Rock and Heavy Wine:

BY TOM WASELESKI

Flying, The Hometown Band
A & M Records, SP4605

This album is a living tribute to
the thrilling, unexpected quality of
music. Its very issue is proof that
however seldom fresh and invigora-
ting new artists come up, they do
nonetheless break through from
time to time, causing stereo junkies
to stop beating the dead dogs of
stars in their decline and perform-
ers living off past laurels.

Stewart maintains an ironically
placid tone. The music is also calm,
as in “If It Doesn't Come Naturally,
Leave It” and “Flying Sorcery.”
Stewart's throaty British elocution
is sharp and clean, as toned and
reﬁned as the music.

This English Dylan for the 70’s
separated from his American
forerunner by light-year of musical
progress, is perhaps too out of step

With a female lead vocal and a
gutsy sax section, The Hometown
Band on _“Flying” is one who’s time
has come.

Shari Ulrich sounds like (for lack
of a better peg) Roberta Flack,
though not as mellow. As potent as
heavy wine, Ulrich can belt it out at
will, unlike Roberta. She also lays
down a mean violin, which can come
in handy _ on a twelve-minute
instrumental like “Spread ’Em All
Around.”

Ulrich leads her tight, new band

to be. Breezy. Swooping. Power-
ful. She lets the words slip from her
mouth like tiny clouds, then pacing
herself with the building backup,
she lets loose a crescendo that goes
beautifully with some careful
orchestration. ,.

Geoff Eyre, the Hometown
Band's percussionist, assists in the
vocals on “Everybody Wants to Get
to Heaven,” a slow, soul tune with
an absolutely first-class saxophone
backup by Claire Lawrence.

“Wingless Bird’ is similarly
melancholy, with its solemn drunfw
pound and sad mellotron. “I’m
Ready” is the closest the band gets
to a solid rocker.

Side two is more than interesting.
With only two cuts of 11 and.,~1;"\*

shows some innovation too seldom
seen, particularly on a debut album.

“Spread ’Em All Around” is
nothing short of a fantastic

tough ﬂute and violin weave.
Through the middle Doug Edwards’
bass work gives way to Ulrich’s
violin which dances a Gaelic jig fort
several minutes. This is certainly
the tastiest chunk of the entire

“Into the Night” proves Ulrich
vocalizing ability. Asteamy, sexy
song, it opens with a soft sax solo
which, almost unnoticed, becomes
Ulrich’s mellower-than-ever voice.

The Pitt basketball team is in Philadelphia today—at least, most of it

is.

But while their teammates are preparing for and playing what could
be the ﬁnal game of this torturous season, three of the taller Panthers
’will be going to class, sleeping late and wishing they were there. A

Until recently, two of the trio’s members—Kelvin Smith and Mike
Rice—were there. Rice was there more than most; if you're talking
about the area under the backboard, he waslthere more than everyone

else on the team combined.

But for one Panther, 6-5 guard-forward Terry Knight, there ‘has been
no 1976-77 season. That, some might say, could be a considerable

blessing, considering Pitt’s 6-20
record. But while Knight won’t

SLIPPERY ROCK--Winning one
out of four events may not sound
like much of a success, but by the
time host Slippery Rock had won the
first three races in the “Rock
Relays” Saturday, the Pantherette
track team cherished that solitary
win.

In the ﬁve-team competition, the

I Rockets began by edging Pitt in the

sprint medley relay. Following a
440-yd. ﬁrst_ leg by Sue Lewis, Pitt’s
Lisa Sciullo (220) and Pam Shaw
(220) had difﬁculty with their

Slippery Rock’s Heather Pullen on

win by 1_.3 seconds. -

  

The distance medley was ‘much
the same story. This relay of Tina
Spivey (.660), Maria Sciullo (440),
Jenny Westman (880) and Chor-
penning (three-quarter mile) trailed
the home team for most of the race
to ﬁnish second by a sizable margin.

Slippery Rock’s Krogstad per-
formed some last second heroics to
overcome the efforts of Panther-
ettes’ Shaw, Lewis, Michelle
.Bressant and Karen Krichko in the
880 relay. The Rocket anchor leg
runner made up a five-yard
difference to give her squadtheir
third victory and for Pitt, a third
second-place.

Panthers Net Saranac

BY STEVE SYBERT

“No one expected us to win
except ourselves, ” Pitt tennis coach
George Dieffenbach said philoso-
phically after the combined men’s
and women's tennis teams won six

matches, lost none and toppled"

two-time defending champion Ohio
State on Sunday to win the third
annual Saranac Cup at the Alpine
Racquet Club.

The team tennis event featured
the top collegiate teams. in the
Mideast, including Ohio State,
whose men are ranked third and
women ﬁrst in the Big Ten; and
always-tough Maryland, runnerup
the past two years in the tourney.
The Panther squad entered the
affair unseeded, having lost to
Maryland in the semiﬁnals last
year, with seemingly little chance
for victory.

But, starting with the opening
round Friday, Pitt mowed down the
opposition one by one and
culminated the tournament victory
with a heart-thumping 26-25
overtime upset of Ohio State in the
ﬁnals on Sunday.

“It was a very, very exciting
match,” Dieffenbach said. “The
whole team made a

team effort. ’ ’ '

In the first event of the
finals—women’s doubles——the

-Maria Paris and Janet DeCostro,
6-1, to build an early margin. The
Paris-DeC,ostro duo ﬁnished with a
4-2 record, losing only to Ohio State
and Maryland.

Paris, who was undefeated in I

women's singles, then nipped
Wilson, 7-6, in the next event. “It
was a really big win, because it got
the momentum swinging in Pitt’s
favor,” lauded Dieffenbach. ‘

Down 12-8 in total games .won,
the Panthers gained an important
victory in_the men’s doubles from
freshman Tom Liebenguth. (the
tourney’s most valuable player) and
senior veteran Mike Habbel, who
Dieffenbach cited as “one of the
reasons we did so well in the
tourney.” The 6-4 men’s doubles
win raised the Liebenguth-Habbel
record to 5-1 and closed the gap of
total games won to 16-14 in Ohio
State’s favor.

was conﬁdent that her teammates
would not let themselves return to
Oakland without a win. “We are
going to turn them (Slippery Rock)
right off the track,” she declared
before the race.

Figuratively, Spivey proved cor-
rect as she, Maria Sciullo, Krichko
and Bressant led from start to ﬁnish
to win the Pantherettes’ only medal.

Second Season Opens 
For Panther Tankmen  

BY JIM GEFSKY

T_hegPitt«men’s swimming team
begins its “second season" today
through Saturday when the Pan-
thers travel to the third annual
Eastern Swimming Championships

~ at West Virginia University.

Finishing with an overall 7-2
slate, Pitt will go against the
Maryland Terrapins, a team to
which the Panthers dropped a close
58-55 dual meet contest at College
Park and ﬁnished second at the
Penn State Relays—a mini version
of the Eastems. The fact that
Maryland has beaten the Panthers
twice could be deceiving, however,
since the Terps were in much better
condition for_ the relays than any
other team. It could be that
Mary1and’s times may have peaked
at Penn State, an unenviable
condition considering the ideal is to
peak at the Eastems.

Although Pitt and the Terrapins
are the super-powers at the meet,
there are also some very strong
mortal powers present, with East
Carolina being the strongest.
Carolina could win the Eastems,
but it'would have to get outstanding
performances from its swimmers.
Since diving was de-emphasized
several years ago, that area of the
East Carolina program is very weak.

Syracuse and West Virginia (who
will have the home pool advantage)
probably won't win, but are strong
enough in several events to be

_ considered spoilers.
Despite those strong squads, the]
‘ Panthers will_be__trying_to  their 5 -

  

second-straight Easterns title. Last
year, with champions Jerry DeMuro
in the 1650- and 500-yard freestyles,

Dave Civis in the 200-yard freestyle )

and Neal Wallace in the 100-yard
backstroke, Pitt downed second-
-place East Carolina by 144 points for
the honors.

"‘I think the kids can do it this
year,” head coach Dick Bradshaw
claimed. “We’re going to have to
get up mentally and overcome the
psychological disadvantage of los-
ing to Maryland twice before.
We've shaved and tapered, and are
getting a lot of rest and doing two
light practices a day. We’re
generally healthy—although we’ve
had some illness. But in any event
the Easterns are a tremendous
challenge to us.”

The tankers have a huge job
ahead of them and will ﬁnd. out
Saturday just’ how long their
“second season” lasts.

Tankers’ DeMuro Very Un-Naber-ly    

BY MARK MURPHY

The impression one gets upon
greeting Pitt swimmer Jerry
DeMuro for the ﬁrst time is that he
is not as tall as expected. Anticipa-
ting the long, lean John Naber-type
swimmer, one is temporarily
surprised to ﬁnd a grinning,
medium-sized ﬁgure instead.

DeMuro wears a bright friendly
smile and is able to put a guest at

L ease in the cramped recesses of a

dormitory room.) Soon, the
swimming expert begins to talk of
his specialty and the conversation
becomes one-sided. ,

“I started swimming when I was
eight years old,” the senior from
Philadelphia said. “I swam for a
country club in the summer, mostly
because it gave me something to do.
The thing sort of snowballed as I
became older.

_ “Icame out to Pitt as a recruit
after a close friend of mine had
come out,” DeMuro continued.
“He really liked it a lot. When I
came out I met some of the guys on
the_ team and I liked them very
much. As far as swimming goes,
you can’t beat the facilities here.
They are some of the best in the
world. I saw a real good chance to
improve myself.”

Despite his claim to being only a
mediocre swimmer after he entered
Pitt, DeMuro has managed to work

“Right now, swimming is an
everyday thing,” he said. “On a
typical day I swim yardage
amounting to about 10 miles. I get
up before six o’clock in the morning
and swim until about eight. Later I
go back and lift weights, then swim
again until about six. Some days we
swim less, some days more.”

Despite his great love for the
sport, DeMuro often grows tired of
the work and questions himself as to
why he took up swimming, possibly
the most time consuming of
hobbies.

“Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Why
did I take up swimming and not
some other sport that is not" an all
year, 24-hour a day thing?’ I am
kind of tired of the hard work but it
has been fun. I enjoy the winning.”

DeMuro should enjoy the win-
ning—he has had much practice at
it. The tanker has been a prep
school All-American, an Eastern
United States champion, an Olym-
pic Trials competitor, the premier
Eastern college swimmer at 500 and
1,000 yards and is also undefeated
at Pitt in dual meets three years
running.

In spite of the time-consuming

lighter things in life as well as his
studies.

do that, you have to be sort of cool
and conﬁdent. You have to take
things as they come and be
conﬁdent of your own abilities.”

However, while Harris has the-

inner drive to succeed, he’s also

peting in a different way than when
you aren’t in a game.

“Once I'm off the ﬂoor, I sort of

pragmatic standpoint, if you don't
stay eligible you can't compete.” t

DeMuro’s main problems this
year have been‘an injury and the
catcalls from opposing fans—the
penalty of success in sports.

“I was out of the pool for two
weeks this year because I pulled a
muscle over Christmas vacation,”
DeMuro said. “It was really
frustrating. The time really

Just after the various swimming
championships are completed in
March, DeMuro is due to attain his
degree in speech communications,

and thoughts of employment are

splashing around in his mind.

“I could go home and get a job,”
he commented. “But I would also
like to coach, especially at the
college level. It is tough to just walk
away from something after you have
been at it for so many years.”

Considering the success DeMuro
has had over the past four years, it
will be even tougher for the Pitt
swim team to watch him walk away.

the two years he has left at Pitt. A 6-5 ballhandler is a rare and treasured
ﬁnd, and that’s one of the areas in which Knight is working.

“I think I can handle the ball,” he said. “I think I can handle it fairly
well—no one will take it from me—but I’m no Earl the Pearl."

Knight is realistic when evaluating his abilities and attempts to
remain level-headed when reviewing his situation.

“I’m not the kind who, if we lose, keeps it with me," he said. “I sit
down, think about the game and what happened, and after that, that
game's gone. It’s time to start on the next one.

“I tried not to let the injury get to me. I felt bad enough wishing I
could play and it was enough just trying to deal with that."

‘He’s had a whole season of practicing how to accept a street-clothed
seat on the bench, andnow he's ready for next year.

“We can be as good as we want to be...but I can't forecast the future
and I don't even want to try. Ijust want to play.”

Thanks to the redshirt rule, Knight will be eligible for the next two
seasons, years most persons agree will see Pitt basketball rise at a rate
faster than tuition, room and board. ,

“I’m glad I have two more left,” said Knight. “I want to use both of
them—every year I can. lhave a goal and] want to do everything I canto

I reach that goal. ' '

His goal is a high one—“I want to keep on playing ball when I get out

Eagles Go to Pieces Over
Pantherette Gymnast Squad

BY MARK MURPHY

Breaking records as easily as a
rock breaks glass, the Pitt women's
gymnastics team trampled Lock
Haven State 132.10-97.35 Saturday
to ﬁnish the year at 4-3, their third
straight winning season.

“That was our goal all year (over
130 points), coach Donna DeMarino
said. “It was our last meet and we

' went way over. This wasn't a fluke.

We deserved 132 points and we are
a 132-point team. Everyone
performed well.”

No one performed better than
Pantherette Regina Carson.
Though just a freshman, the Belle
Vernon native alreadv holds three
Pitt gymnastic records—for vault-
ing, 3 balance beam and floor
exercises. She captured all those
titles'Saturday and also copped the
all-around championship with
score of 34.75. -

“Regina is definitely the best

all-arounder we have ever had,”
DeMarino noted. , ‘

Complementing Carson against
the’ Eagles was Alison Hoburg,
another of DeMarino’s record-shat-
tering freshmen. Hoburg set the
Pitt record for the uneven parallel
bars Saturday with an 8.65 and
finished second in the all-around
with a 33.70.

“This has been the year of the
record,” said DeMarino. “This is
our strongest team ever. The nicest
thing about it is all the high scorers
are freshmen except for Cyndee
Severyn, who is a junior. They will
all be back."

In addition to the records Carson
and Hoburg set, the 1977 Pan-
therettes are also the highest
scoring team in Pitt's history and
hold the record for highest team
score in all four events.

“There has been an amazing
improvement this year,” DeMarino
understated. “When you meet both
Clarion and Penn State in your dual
meet season you have shot your
chances for an undefeated season.
But we would not change it. We like
the competition. Still, this has
been an outstanding year for us.”

Others who lent a hand in the Pitt
win were Severyn, who took third in
the all-around and second on the

' invited,” DeMarino said.

beam, and Germaine Zubritsky with
a second on the vault.

“Germaine’s vaulting has im-
proved tremendously over the
course of the year,” DeMarino
praised. “Her all-around scores
have also improved.”_

The Pantherettes will learn today
or tomorrow whether they are one of
14 teams invited to the Regionals to
be held in Towson, Md.

Bowlers Spared Loss

BY JERRY VTLLELLA

“On any given day...” goes the‘

old sports saying, invoked when-
ever a hapless underdog topples a
powerhouse. The words were never
more in place than last Saturday
when the Pitt bowling team scored
its first match win of the season over
a stunned Duquesne squad, taking
two of three games on the Dukes
home lanes.

The Dukes, winners of the
American College Union Invitation-
al Region 4 tournament champion-
ship at Maryland University on
January 29, needed a sweep of the
Panthers to set up a rematch
between themselves and St.
Vincent College for the champion-
ship of the Western" Pennsylvania-
lntercollegiate Bowling Congress
(WPIBC) southern division.

Pitt Swimmers Really
Have It All Together

BY PIXIE SOHN

The theme has been togetherness
for the men and women's swimming
and diving teams this past season,
but with the Eastems on March 4-6,
it's time each team went its
separate ways.

Followng an old Amateur
Athletic'_ L.lion theory, both squads
have combined coaches, practice
techniques, facilities and equip-
ment. Recently, they have added
their own unique touch—an out-
break of measles.

The new program has the teams
divided into groups of 30 according
to each event. These groups are
then assigned a speciﬁc coach-
either head coach Dick Bradshaw or
one of his assistants—-Fred Lewis,
Kate Mathison and Al Coffey. The
result has been more personal and
individual instruction as well as
emphasis on the group’s own
strengths and weaknesses.

There have been positive results

on both sides, but especially for the
women. ‘

According to assistant coach
Lewis, one of the goals has been to
increase the level of international
competition for females.

“By getting the girls to lift
weights and swim yardage, whether
they believe in the technique or not,
and placing them along side of the
guys, we are increasing their
aggressiveness and confidence,”
said Lewis. “Competition with the
guys has forced them to live up to
their potentials.” -

The work has paid off as the‘

women’s times have steadily
decreased throughout the season,
but for the men, the advantages of
co-training’ have mostly been a
matter of pride.

Since recruiting was down last
year, there have not been enough
newcomers to push the veterans for
positions and the women have filled

this void. In this two-way rivalry,

bafﬂingly miserable performance
which lost them the match after the
first two games. While Pitt was
breaking out of its usual slow-start
pattern, firing a sharp yet
unspectacular 876, Duquesne dug
itself a huge hole with a 763, giving
the young Pitt squad an unprece-
dented 113:pin lead. The beauty of
the Panthers’ effort was the-
improved consistency of their
individual scores, ranging from
Steve Fendler’s excellent 195 to
Jacqui Kemp’s and Ed Connor’s
combined 15S—'far better than
many of the low ﬁrst-game scores
Pitt has thrown this season.

The second game became a
classic struggle as the’Dukes tried
to clean up their act while Pitt fell off
the mark. The result was a
heart-stopping 816-814 Panther
win, clinched in the ﬁnal frame by
freshman Kevin Fleis_chood’s clutch
spare. Since WPIBC matches are
scored on a seven-point system,
with two points for each game
victory and one for the total
three-game score, Pitt had snared
the match. ' i

The Dukes, though, were not to
be denied some measure of

respectability in the third game,
tossing an early barrage of solid
strikes while Pitt broke down. It
seemed Duquesne might overcome
the Panthers’ 115-pin lead and win
the total pin score, but the Panthers
held on in the ﬁnal frame to take a

'2,444-2,441 squeaker, despite an

excellent 864-752 third-game win.

besides the men not wanting the
women to beat them, the women
realize there is a possibility of
beating the men. This circle has
resulted in both sides working hard
all the time.

The one head coach system has
also allowed for more organization
and stability on the squads.

“Overall it takes twice as much
time with responsibilities to both
teams,’_’ said Lewis. “But it also
keeps everyone jumping, thinking

sharp and staying tough.”

Now it’s time to take these long
hours of practice to the full test as
the women head for Delaware and
the men for West Virginia for the
Eastern meets.

Coach Lewis sees some possibili-
ties for the women this year in the
Easterns. Already the 400-yd.
medley relay team has made the
national qualifying time to compete
in the Nationals at «Brown University
March 17-19. Individually, Lewis
feels the best bets to make

qualifying times lie with Nila
deJesus, Kathy Stetler, Jennifer
Price, Jamie Conley, diver Linda
Hamner and Christy Elston, who
was one of the measles casualties.

“Winkler (Scott) was the ﬁrst to
get them and now Christy,”
explained Lewis. “Not practicing
for a week could really hurt her‘ shot
at the Nationals.” ,

As for the men, Jerry DeMuro
has already made the qualifying
standards for the Nationals, at

three events), DeMuro, Dale

Civis, John Schepner, Orlando
Catinchi, Bob Clemmer and N651
Wallace.
‘ ‘The Eastems is where everyone
is psyched-up,” said Lewis. “They
swim only one event a day, so
everyone is rested. They have t0 be»
as every swimmer there will be a top
competitor.

“We really want an All-American —

this year,” he continued. “Last
season, Jerry missed by one place.
This year we have a éhance of
sending 10 people to the Nationals
to try. It would really be a nice
accomplishment for the seniors
particularly. None made it four
years ago,. and even though it’ll be
tough, maybe this time all of them
can go.”

When it’s all over, the teams just
might have togetherness again—as
winners.
