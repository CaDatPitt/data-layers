Q‘ measures is taken every year to help

By MAGGIE McKAY

Pitt’s Board of Trustees yester-
day approved a resolution authori-
zing the University to borrow $30
million to tide Pitt over until the
State Legislature resolves its
appropriations impasse.

The University is losing an
estimated $2,000 per day while the
legislature debates on whether or
not to give Pitt the $62 million
appropriation recommended by
Governor Shapp, according to
Edward Bozic, assistant to the
Chancellor.

Besides the daily monetary loss,
Bozic estimated Pitt is losing
approximately $5 million per
month, the amount it would have
accrued in interest from the state
appropriation.

“We’ve been losing interest on
these funds, interest which we’d
built into the budget already,”
Bozic said. ,

The trustees’ decision, which
authorizes the University to borrow
funds from area banks, is not a new
According to Bozic, this

Pitt weather_ “upturns and down-
turns in revenue.” . ,

However, he said the Administra-
tion has not had to borrow funds in
the past few years.

Money will be borrowed as it is
needed, according to Chancellor
Posvar, rather than acquired in one
$30 million chunk. '

The trustees executive board
yesterday also approved a new
“affiliations agreement” that will
strengthen the working relationship
between the University Health
Center and the ﬁve Pitt-afﬁliated
hospitals in Oakland. p

Presbyterian-University, Magee-
 men’s, Children’s, Eye and Ear

and Monteﬁore _ hospitals, plus
Pitt’s School of Medicine, from the
University Health Center, which
was incorporated in 1965.

Under the new agreement that
University Ofﬁcials expect to the
hospitals to approves next week,
department chairmen in the School
of Medicine will coordinate clinical
services, teaching and patient care
throughout the member hospitals.
Each department chairman also will
bear the title of ‘ ‘health center chief
of service.” ’

The individual hospitals, accord-
ing to Assistant Vice-Chancellor for
Academic Planning Robert Hickey,
also, will be able to choose ‘their
chiefs of service, who will be under
the direction of the Health Center’s
chief of service.

violation is alleged to have occurred
Sept. 10.

Delta Tau Delta’s charge stems
from a recently written IFC code of
conduct instituted, in part, because
of a long Bayard Street fraternity-
neighbor battle that reappeared
during the past summer.

Neighbors reportedly called IFC
members Sept. 7, complaining of
“congestion” in that area during
the evening. Delta Tau Delta is
charged with not cooperating with
IFC’s investigation of the neigh-
bor’s report.

“IFC ofﬁcers have a responsi-
bility to investigate neighbor
complaints under the new system, ’ ’
IFC president John Powers said.
‘ ‘We tried to in this case, and had no
problems from any of the members
except Delta Tau Delta. ‘

‘ ‘They were not cooperating with
us,” he said.- _

Delta Tau Delta president John
Finn said he thought both the
charges and the complaint by
neighbors were in error. “The new
code says we have to keep a
situation reasonable,” he said,
“and it was reasonable that night.

“It was before midnight,” Finn
said, “and they wanted us to move
people off our porch. We didn’t
think it was unreasonable to be out
at that hour.”

“They didn’t have control of the
people at their house,” said
Powers.

The IFC verdict has not been
announced, but Finn said he
believed the outcome was decided
before the case was heard.

‘ ‘They (the judicial board) went in
there with their minds set, ’ ’ he said.
“We didn’t have a chance.”

Another Greek source said Sigma
Chi and Delta Tau Delta may be
used as examples of a new
get-tough policy on T fraternity
misbehavior.

“They’re scared," the source
said of IFC, “and they aren't about
to let them get away with this type of

thing anymore.”

Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Chi face lntrafraternity Council penalties after

being charged with violations of the new fraternity code of conduct.

Task Force

Budget Battle Strategy

By MARK MURPHY

Aware that the state appropria-
tions battle looms just ahead of
them, Pitt’s ad-hoc student Task
Force for Higher Education met
Tuesday night to ﬁnalize strategy
and ready itself to join the
Administration in a ﬁght for Pitt’s
ﬁnancial life. '0

Led by Student Government
Board members Dave Hesidence
and Chip Hubbard, the task force
formed committees and established
priorities for the impending appro-
priations fight scheduled to begin
Monday in Harrisburg.

“There is a very real possibility
the University will close its doors,”
Hesidence said. “People don’t
realize this and letting them know
will be the biggest job of this task
force.” F

Finalizes

Although the meeting was
attended by only nine students, a
number Hesidence termed “ex-
tremely disappointing,” the group
divided into three committees:
Media Relations, Workshop and
Legislative Research.

The Media Relations Committee
will prepare‘ and send advertise-
ments and news releases to area
papers and local television and
radio stations. The Workshop
Committee will instruct students
about ways to deal with legislators
in letter and phone campaigns.

The Legislative Research Com-
mittee will keep tabs on each
legislator’s position on non-prefer
red appropriations, making sure all
participants in the budget ﬁght
have accurate, timely data.

Physicians named to the medical
staffs of the hospitals will also have
to be qualiﬁed for teaching posts
within the medical school.

“I don’t know if you can say the
University will have more control
over the hospitals,” Hickey said.
“Rather, we'll have a more _efﬁcient
organization. Ifthere are too many
chiefs and not enough Indians, it’s
hard to come to an agreement about
program development.”

The agreement took a year to
negotiate. Monteﬁore Hospital, the
newest member of the ﬁve-hospital
complex, objected to the plans to
centralize administrative power in

medical school department chair-

men. The hospital feared its
autonomy in clinical practice and
instruction would be compromised.
The original plan, which varied
little in detail from the present
arrangement, was voted down by
the medical school faculty last
September. The measure fell 21
votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed to pass it.
“Monteﬁore was dissatisﬁed. It
was the last hospital to join the
Health Center and most areas of
excellence were well developed
before they joined,” Hickey said.
Monteﬁore, along with Presby-
terian-University, is an adult
medical surgical hospital. The

E Plan Unites Pitt, Health Center

other three institutions are specialty
hospitals. According to Hickey,
Presbyterian had many more highly
developed patient care and research
program than Monteﬁore, which
tended to duplicate its educational
programs.

The administrative centraliza-
tion, Hickey said, is expected, to
guarantee all hospitals the oppor-
tunity to grow and develop better
programs.

Throughout the meeting, quick
action was stressed as the crucial
factor in determining Pitt’s immed-
iate future. If this appropriations
ﬁght should languish in the State
House until January, the money Pitt
receives “won’t do one bit of
good,” according to Hesidence.

“There’s a possibility we won’t
get any appropriation but the odds

_are greater we will,” Hesidence

said. ‘.‘We have to guard against
letting this thing string out until
January. There will come a point in
time when Pitt will not have any
money. The interest payments (on
loans Pitt would have to take out to
remain open) would get so high we_
would have to raise tuition.”

‘ ‘I think what we have to do is lay
the cards on the table,” he said. ‘ ‘If
giving people the facts isn’t enough
to elicit action in the matter,
something is wrong._ The facts are
shocking. ”

The task force has met with
Chancellor Posvar and will work
with the Administration toward the
goal of a quick resolution of the
problem. Hesidence was quick to
point out that his group serves as an
additional voice from Pitt to the
legislators.

“We realize we’re in the same
boat as the Administration,”
Hesidence said. “We've been
sensitive to them and they’ve been
sensitive to us. It would be idiotic to
allow differences to arise between
elements of the University. We are
a spontaneous movement of stu-
dents and are in no way run by the
Administration. They have dictated
nothing.”
Unlike legislators and
the task force
refused to criticize Posvar’s public
handling of the crisis.
“He’s been criticized by some
people who believe he should be

SOITIC

taking a harder public stand,”
Hesidence said. “Those people
who have been critical don’t
understand the inner workings of
the State Legislature. The
Chancellor is extremely concerned
and he’s very well aware of the
legislature’s inner workings.

“His concern is that this thing
will get really strung out to‘the point
where we can’t run the University. ’ ’

Two male students on the third
ﬂoor of Tower A received numerous
phone calls over a two-night period
from a man who identified himself
as “Wong” from Wong’s Pizzeria,
telling them the pizzas they ordered
were ready to be delivered. The
students were confused because
they never ordered any pizzas, and
threatened to call the police. Wong
said not to bother because he was a
police officer. The students called
the campus police to confirm the
authenticity of Wong’s story, but
the claim was denied.

A 25-year-old man, who had
previously assaulted a 30-year-old
female Pitt student, trapped her in a

ﬂed. Campus police later picked
him up in the Frick Fine Arts
building. .

An unknown person -destroyed a

A 23-year-old man was observed
rolling a suspected marijuana
cigarette in his parked car on Fifth
and Bouquet Streets Saturday
night. When campus police asked
the man to get out of the car, he
attempted to throw a bag of
marijuana and a scale, in the
backseat. A 10 inch throwing knife
was found on the ﬂoor of the car.
The male was arrested for a drug
violation and possession of an
offensive weapon.

At 2 a.m. Saturday, a male
student on the second floor of
Webster Hall received a knock on
his door from an unknown male,
who asked if he could stay the night.
The student’s roommate was gone
for the evening, so he gave the man
permission to stay. The Pitt student
awoke at 7 a.. to ﬁnd the unknown
male gone, along with his wallet,
$20 cash and a sweater. The visitor
left a sweater and a shirt behind.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

SGB Review-Part Ill

Last February we made a Student Government Board (SGB)
campaign issue of student input.

Noting grass-root dissatisfaction among black students and
commuters, we advised SGB members to make good their
campaign promises and do more than talk about advised SGB
campaign promises and do more than talk about student

needs.

Our complaint is not that SGB has not been listening; instead,
the students have not been talking.

This was not always the case. Last year the Black Action Society
(BAS) held’ a sit-in in SGB offices. The commuters were vocal
about their problems. A referendum approved an assembly
representing a broad segment of the student body, given commuter
involvement. -

With this dissent we welcomed Bernie Payne, a former member
of the BAS steering committee, and the commuter champions,
J oAnn Levinson and David Hesidence.

Eight months have elapsed for the Payne administration. Little
has been heard from the black or commuter communities. And to
top that, the new student assembly met the other day with only 35
of its .117 members in attendance; many saying they came only
because their budgets would be frozen if they didn’t.

Something is wrong with Pitt students. Perhaps they are still in a
stupor, celebrating a number-one football team. It is more
probable that their aspirations direct them past today’s student
government and toward a future.

rnititllisneeetltx line:-°>_,.t°.<>_ l_<zI!ef.*1°*._1.2.h..,al1 the input students
fought for in the past WIII be shelved. 1t’s time for students to get
off their lazy aspirations.

Editor’s note: The following is a
letter from black studies depart-
ment chairman Curtiss Porter to
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg concerning the
tenure denial of assistant professor
Patrick Ntukogu.

Dear Dean Rosenberg:

I have read your letter to Prof.
Ntukogu. In it you state that you
will not go to the Tenure Selection
Committee to review Ntukogu.
Rather you have evaluated and
determined that he should not be
awarded tenure nor an appropriate
tenure review. Additionally, I have
discussed this matter with -you on
the phone. You indicated at that

matter was “challengeable.” I
think this is. so.

In reviewing the cited FAS
Gazette I do not ﬁnd that the duly
constituted tenure review proce-
dures as constructed and approved

-by the faculty of the University of

Pittsburgh give you the prerogative
to derail_Prof. Ntukogu’s right to
review by the Tenure Selection
Committee. Moreover it appears
that your action in this case violates
both the spirit and the letter of
that faculty document. .

It occurs to me that I have in the
past defended your office against
charges of effecting a more
“direct” control over the personnel
and program of this department
than others in FAS. I had thought
that you had attempted from your
own point-of view to operate with
candor and fairness. Your action
here, in the shadow of the Yusef Ali
case, has caused me to question my
defense. It appears that I, as
representative of‘the cooperative
ideals of this department, had
sought too much to “get along” in
the interest of creating an
agreeable framework for the work

Language Incompetence Doubted  

Iwanted to make some comments
concerning the faculty English
competency survey in the Pitt News
last week. First, I'm sure that there
are numerous instructors whose
competency in the English lan-
guage leaves something to be
desired; however, I have met many
students who totally exaggerate the
prob‘. em. Ihave had ﬁve instructors
at Pitt who are foreign and who all
spoke English very well, yet I have
heard some students complaining
about their English when there was
absolutely no reason to do so. Yes,
they had slight accents, but their
English was completely compre-
hensible. As a matter of fact, they
probably spoke better English than
some of the American-born stu-

dents themselves. I'd like to see
some of the people here do as well in
a Japanese, Spanish or Indian
University! I think we should give
many of the foreign students and
instructors who are here credit for
doing as well as they do.

I also think we should not forget
that a large number of us in the
United States at one time or another
had ancestors who did their best to
learn the English language.

I think there should be English
competency tests for instructors,
and I'm not saying that this problem
does not exist, but I think that in
certain cases some people should
learn a little~tolerance.

and development of this faculty. I
can not see how you consider your
action in this case to be in the
interest of the DBCERD or the
University at large.

Section 6, Page 7, Vol. 9, No. 1 of
the FAS Gazette states clearly and

unequivocally that. “Whenever a.

recommendation for appointment
or promotion to tenured rank is
submitted by a department to the
Dean of FAS, he shall seek the
advice of a Review Committee...
(see section a through e).” To the
extent that this constitutes normal
and biding procedure in FAS you
have violated such procedure by
your recent action.

It -seems also that you have
adopted a peculiar manner of
separating the recommendations of
the DBCERD into parts convenient
to yourself. You have stated that
departmental Tenure Review Com-
mittees report to yourself and not
to Chairpersons. This does not
seem likely, except in our own case
where you have unduly separated
the view of the chair from that of
the tenured and non-tenured
faculty in several issues of
promotion or retention.

I think your judgment in this case
should be challenged. I think it
ruptures a hard-sought unity of
purpose between this faculty and
the University in general. I think it
opens this department up to
continuing and debilitating interanl
_turmoil. I can not help but think
that, given your statement on
precedents in these matters. vour

long-standing involvement with the
problems and accomplishments,
aims and ideals of this department
point out that there is in this act a
more than apparent potential for
the disruption of continuity and

purpose inthe work of this faculty. * -

You must know that this will fan
the flames of conflict both within
and outside of this department.

In thinking this matter over I ﬁnd
that I am forced to judgments of the
sort which I have contained in this
communication. I regret that
diplomacy and ﬂexibility have not
served to increase your u_nder-
standing of the special concerns of
black studies practitioners, faculty,

have no bass sax, since there is no
such instrument. They do however
have a baritone sax, played by
Manion. Novi plays alto sax and
tenor sax, something Mr. Brian
failed to catch. Brian also informs
the naive reader that the Jukes
have a keyboard player named Mr.
Popeye. Any Jukes fan could tell
you that “Popeye” Pentifallo plays

plays the harmonica. Believe it or

Southside Johnny and the

By BETSY NORMAN

Bert Lance’s voluntary resigna-
tion Wednesday as the director of
the Office of Management and
Budget must have come as welcome
relief to Jimmy Carter. Despite his
vigorous defense of Lance, Carter
had to come to the realization the
political cost of keeping Lance was
too great.

Lance, a long time friend of
Carter, had been charged with
unethical, if not outright illegal,
banking methods while president of
the Calhoun, Georgia First National
Bank. Among the chargs were
extensive overdrafts, double use of
collateral for loans and personal and
possible political use of a bank
plane.

Carter soon realized the so-called
“Lance affair” was blemishing his
relatively untarnished image. The
President was losing credibility
daily.

The whole Lance situation was a
painful onefor Carter. His actions
at the nationally televised press

conference were illogical. On one
hand, Carter said Lance’s reputa-
tion was clean and that he had
completely exonerated himself at
last week's Senate hearings. But
later Carter agreed with Lance that

resignation was the right thing to
do.

Carter made it clear he knew the
possible consequences of the Lance
controversy to his image. As he put
it, the affair had created “serious
doubts among the news media,

among the people of this country,
about the integrity of me and our
government.”

Carter set unusually high re-
quirements for himself and his
future appointments during his
campaign. While Lance’s actions
were not proven illegal, they were
certainly far below Carter’s white
knight standards. '

Carter’s obvious struggle be-
tween a desire to be fair and just
when dealing with a friend and
advisor and an obligation to
preserve the integrity of his
administration could help him win
back some of the public support he
recently lost. By allowing Lance to
answer charges before the Senate
committee, Carter both gave his

friend a chance to clear his name v

and the American people the
opportunity to hear the facts
ﬁrst~hand. .

Lance’s resignation will also help
Carter in the political sphere.

Reports from the Senate, which
plays an important role in
determining the fate of Carter's
energy plan as well as the Panama
Canal treaty, indicate Carter is
losing credibility there, also. On
issues such as these, Carter must
lay his image on the line to try to
swing critical votes in his favor.

Lance’s resignation ends his own
dilemm_a. But questions remain:
how much damage did the Lance
affair do? Will Carter regret his
initial appointment of Lance? Will
Carter emerge from this whole
thing unscathed?

discriminate. All ages, sexes and
abilities are sought. Only
interested runners should inquire.

After seeing some .of the

, classifieds in the Pitt news, this one

doesn’t seem too unreasonable.

More and more people are taking to
the streets this year (running, that
is) and some people may be

~ wondering if there are other crazy

people who have the same interests
in running as they do. Well, if you
live in the Pittsburgh area, you are
in luck. Not only are there other
crazy people of the same sex, age
and running ability as you, but
there are groups of them.

In the Pittsburgh area, you are in

luck. Not only are there other crazy

people of the same sex, age‘ and
running ability as you, but ‘there
are groups of them.

In the Pittsburgh area, and at
Pitt, three well-established running
groups are waiting for all inter-
ested runners to join their ranks.

If you are a runner who is just
getting started, the Pittsburgh
Road Runners may be the group to
turn to. If you have been running
for a longer time and are interested

in some unpressured road races

and cross-country meets, check out
the Human Energy Club. If you are
an eligible college student who has
a more serious interest in inter-
collegiate running, why not go out
for the Pitt track team?

Runners or joggers who have the
competitive spirit or who are
looking for a jogging companion in
Schenley Park should contact the

' Pittsburgh Road Runners. “We’re"

looking for anybody,” says Stu

Levy, president of the Road
Runners Group. “Age, sex and
ability make no difference. We

were established to promote the
cheapest and best exercise
known.”

The GPRR sponsors numerous’
meets and fun runs throughout the
year. including several runs during
the fall season. In celebration of

"National Jogging Day, the -Road

Runners have .slated two races for
10 a.m. on Oct. 8 at North Park;
one is two miles and the other five.
The following week, on Oct. 16,
South Park will be the scene of a
two-mile and a 15-kilometer race at
1 p.m. On Oct. 23, ‘Levy and his
Pittsburgh Road Runners will
sponsor a 4‘/2-mile cross-county
championship in Schenley Park at
1 p.m.

Moving up the ladder a bit—for
runners bitten deeper by the bug, it
is wise to look into Pitt’s Human
Energy Road Racing Club. Along
with the Human Energy team, it is
possible to run a variety.of road
races, from the John F. Kennedy

FEATURES

.\

cross-country race at Schenley Park
to the Boston Marathon.

The Human Energy group also
provides the opportunity to run

against Pittsburgh’s best. in‘

addition to the Frank Shorters, the
Bill Rodgers and the Lasse Virens.
The club has had a member in
nearly every major race in the
country.

Tom Allison, founder of the club,
also extends his invitation to all

interested runners (men and

women) who are looking for. a well
established team.
“We’re not necessarily looking

for the runner who was a star in
high school, Allison said. “ hat

we are looking for is a runner who
likes low pressure, competitive

races. .
“There's a lot of running talent

here at Pitt, not only under-
graduates but grad students. staff
and faculty,” Allison added. “You
never know what you can do until
you try. Long distance running is a
sport in which you continue to
improve with maturity.”

Allison cited famous runners like
Jack Foster, who didn’t start
running until the age of 34, and
current mile world record holder
John Walker, a former tennis and
rugby player, who didn’t run

competitively until his late teens.

The Human Energy Road Racing
Team currently has more than 40
members. They include Sam Bair,
who is a 3.55 miler and cross
country coach at Allegheny Com-
munity College and one of the top
women marathoiiers in the world,
and Lisa Matovcik, a cancer
researcher at Pitt.

The club has a great lineup of fall
meets, including Pittsburgh’s
Great Race next Sunday from Frick
Park to Point Park, the Johnstown
Marathon Oct. 1, the Skyline
23, the JFK
three-mile race at Schenley Park
Nov. 6 and "the International Peace
Run, a 25-kilometer race on Nov. 12
in Youngstown, Ohio. ’

“If you're an eligible Pitt student
and thinking about goingout for the
Pitt track team, why not give it a
try?" said Mike Agostinella, Pitt’s
head track coach. “We're
currently looking strong with 50
guys signed up for the team. but

with 18 events that’s less than‘;

three men an event.”

Agostinella is interested not only
in runners but jumpers_ and
weightmen as well. “We’ve had a
good turnout from students so far,
but I know there still is a lot of track
talent on campus," Agostinella
said. ‘

Pitt’s cross-country team has
been practicing since July\; The
other Pitt trackmen will soon start
light conditioning workouts in
preparation for the indoor season.

She ’s All Strung Up Over Flying Kites

By RICH HARRY

“Go fly a kite.”
A hackneyed expression, but say

it to Maryann Brown and chances

are she’ll take you seriously.

Earlier this year she visited a kite
store in Philadelphia——one of a few
of its kind on the East Coast-and
decided to transplant the idea to
Pittsburgh.

“It looked like such a fun thing,”
Brown said. So, she abandoned a
career in special eduacation to
launch her own establishment.
Last April, Brown opened “Flying
High,” a Shadyside shop dealing
exclusively in imported and domes-
tic kites. ,

Manufactured in countries such
as West Germany, China and
Japan, the kites vary in size, color,

With Learning

“Let him work his way through
college.” Pitt’s Financial Aid
Office took that advice and, due to
its work/study program, almost
500 students are working their way
through school this term.

“Eligibility for the program is
decided by the Financial Aid Office
after a student submits requests for
aid,” said Libby Fonseca, program
coordinator. “We attempt to
match the job with the student's
interests.”

There are 700 job openings on
the Oakland campus alone.
Carnegie. Museum, the Boys Club.
Children’s Hospital and the De-
partment of Environmental Re-

search are
employers.

A student can work for any
organization on campus that is
non-profit and non-sectarian. The
job supervisor is responsible for 20
percent of the student’s $2.50 per
hour wages; the University pays
the rest through Federal funds.

The number of work hours
awarded is determined by aca-
demic year. Freshmen get nine
hours ‘a week; sophomores, 10;
juniors, '11 and seniors, 12.
Graduate students. receive 15
hours a week.

range from $12.50 to about $90. A
kite that will carry a $400 price tag
is in the offing.

“Kite-ﬂying is relatively inex-
pensive; people pay as much for
skateboards and bowling balls,”
Brown said while walking among
her wares, which are fashioned
after things like bi-planes, octu-
puses and insects. “It’s a cheap
sport, but one that’s lots of fun.”

Brown termed kite-buying an
investment because kites usually
survive flights intact for about 20
years and “if they get caught in a
tree, they are easy to repair.

“These kites are beautifully
engineered,” she added‘. “Most
are nylon and some are paper—but
those kinds usually are used for
decoration. although they can be
flown.”

Brown also plans to design kites
with school or fraternity colors to
attract the college crowd.

But kite-flying is geared to all
age groups, she said. from, 6-year-
olds who want to play in the park to
60-year-olds who purchase kites as
collector's items.

“I've met the most interesting
people." Brown said of her
customers. “They don't come here
looking for status items. but for
kites they can use as decorative
items. in addition to flying them.

“And when they come into here.
they can't believe it." she added.
"They haven't seen a kite store.

except those that sell nickel and
dime kites. But those things are

such bummers they can’t fly.”

Brown, who said she has ﬂown I

kites since her youth, claimed the
sport has grown “terrifically” in
Pittsburgh, as suggested by her
sales. But she pinpointed the West
Coast as the area where kite-ﬂying
eiithusiasts abound.

“Kite-flying is the most popular
thing on the West Coast,” Brown
said. “In New York City, people
take their lunch outside and watch
the pigeons, but in places like San
Francisco, they go out and fly their
kites.”

Lament:

Uneventful Weekends

couldiyt wait until Friday car?,,_ ‘
. S A

By MARK CELENDER

lt’s Thursday evening and Tim
Myers (pseudonym), a Pitt fresh-
man, sits on the desk of his Tower-C
single room. Arms folded, legs
sprawled forward, he stares out the
window wondering how he’ll spend
the weekend.‘ Looking around his
room, you can tell he’s not ready to
accept it as his home away from
home. The bulletin board is bare;
only a pencil and some change lie on
the shelves; clothes, books, football
banners, albums and other goods
are still packed in opened boxes.

‘‘I hate when Fridaysﬂcome,” he
says shaking his head. “As soon as
classes are over you have to start
planning. the weekend, and there's
never anything to do. At home I

around. There was alwa
something to do.”

Home for Tim is a small town in
Northern _ Pennsylvania with a
population of less than 4,000. In
high school he played first string
football as a running back and
wrestled at 145 lbs. But at Pitt he’s
too small for football and doesn’t

feel he’s good enough to compete in‘

collegiate wrestling.

“It’s just not the same, you know.
Autumn doesn’t seem right without
going to football practice and

fooling around with my buddies A

back home.” "
Tim looks like the stereotype
rural American youth: worn blue
jean overalls, longsleeved red and

white plaid shirt rolled to. the
elbows, tan earth shoes and a fresh
hair cut that displays a contrast of
tanned and greyish skin around the
neck and ears.

“Back home I always had
something to do when the weekends
came, but here I don’t really know
anyone and there’s not much to
do.” .

He turns his head from the
-window and looks at the wall across
the room. Suddenly, as though
under the inﬂuence of a drug, his
eyes become glassy, his cheeks rise
and a smile comes to his face. Once
again he’s in that small Northern
Pennsylvania town. ’

“Autumn was always my favorite
time of the year. You could feel the
excitement in the air with the new
school year beginning. All through
the school there was the fresh small
of paint and everyone wearing new
clothes and being excited about who
was in their classes.

‘ ‘After school I’d always take my
dog for a walk in the woods and we’d
stalk up on deer, rabbits, just about

‘anything we’d see. This is a good

their jobs worthwhile. Many of
them are working as counselors in
the University.”

Many of the undergraduates
work/ study students are employed
by University departments as
secretaries and assistants. Psych-
ology and life sciences are the

‘ggest department employers.

“Debbie Domon, a senior math
major, works in the psychology
department “measuring the inter-
action in ﬁlms of parents and their
children.” Although she does not
want to make this her career,
Debbie believes the job has helped
her “because I learned to pay more
attention to what people say.” The
job also has provided her with
invaluable references from faculty
members, she said.

Another math major with a job

I _nreIated to her field is Karen
xgemko, a secretary for Pitt’s‘

yearbook, ’the ’owl. “I don’t mind
ﬁling all afternoon because it's
money for school,” Karen said.
She added that being a secretary
for a school organization is a good
way to get involved and meet
different types of people.

There is a correlation between
having a University job and staying
in school, according to Fonseca.
“A freshman usually feels like he
is a part of the University and is
more likely to stay if he has a
University job."

waiting list for job openings,
Fonseca said. The Financial Aid
Office will know by Oct. 1 if there
are funds available to award more
jobs during this winter term.

time of the year for animals running
around.”

When telling anecdotes of back
home, Tim’s body becomes enthu-
sed. Hand gestures and facial
expressions change quickly with his
speech and his foot dangles from
the desk, moving back and forth like
a happy pup wagging its tail.

“I remember one time me and
Shiner (his dog) were stalking up on
a rabbit grazing in a ﬁeld by my
house. We were about ten feet
away from it,” he points to an
imaginary rabbit on the
ﬂoor. Then, slumping his shoulders
and holding his hands out'like cat
with its paws ready to attack its
prey, he continues: “Just when we
were ready to spring at the rabbit, I
hear Shiner give out this loud yelp.

“The rabbit takes off toward the
woods and I look over at Shiner and
there’s this big swarm of yellow-
jackets (bees) ﬂying all around us.
You should have seen us. . .I swear if
me and Shiner were clocked we’d
have broken the four-minute mile. ’ ’
He pauses, then shakes his head
with a smirk. “I got away with only
a sting on my arm but poor Shiner,
he was hurtin’ all over.”

A photograph album lies-on the

. bolster above his bed, close to his

pillow. Inside are pictures of his
family and friends at picnics,
football games and graduations;
Tim in his football and wrestling
uniforms and various shots of
wildlife. ‘'1 took all the animal
pictures,” he says boastfully.
Much of his free time is spent
paging through the album.

When asked about school here at
Pitt, the lively mannerisms and
enthusiasm fades away and he
withdraws from the blissful
memories. Once again he turns to
the window.

“I don’t know. I’d like to be a
veterinarian but I hear it’s pretty
tough getting into vet school. I
don’t know.. .I guess I'll give it a try
and see what my advisor thinks I
should do.”

He becomes uneasy when the
conversation is related to Pitt, and is
quick to change the subject. “I
brought all my ﬁshing gear,” he
points, with his thumb extended
like a hitchhiker, at a Garcia fishing
rod and reel propped in the corner.
“But I don’t think anyone around
here likes ﬁshing.”

“Sometimes I kind of wish I’d
have signed up for a double room.
At least I would have had a
roommate to buddy around with.
But you know, when I was
registering for a room I ﬁgured I

wouldn't have enough privacy to
study if I had a roommate.” He
forces as laugh and says, “Now I've
got too much privacy." .

The phone next door rings but can

ALL ABOUT GRADS   @652  

Plus-minus Proposal Sparks Controversy

By BETSY NORMAN

The issue of plus-minus grading
for Faculty of Arts and Sciences

_ (FAS) graduate students has been

controversial for months. The
proposal, ﬁrst suggested by FAS
Associate Dean Elizabeth Baran-
ger, followed the enactment of plus-
minus grading for undergraduates

in the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) last spring.

The issue was ﬁrst aired in April
at an‘ FAS Graduate Council
meeting which was chaired by
Baranger.

According to Baranger, it is
confusing to have two grading
systems within FAS.

“Plus-minus grading has been
approved for CAS, and since
graduate students can register for
100-level CAS courses and the same
faculty teaches both graduate and
undergraduate courses, it would
make the grading system simpler,”
Baranger said.

“A grading system without
plus-minus grading does not make

The proposed graduate student
directory, a fall term project of the
Graduate and Professional Student
Organization (GPSA), has been

bandoned due to unexpected legal
culties, according to GPSA
vice-chairman Bill Voharas.

The project was designed to
supplement the faculty and staff
directory, which does not contain
addresses and phone numbers of
graduate students other than
teaching assistants and teaching
fellowsj

One problem with the directory
is the student’s right to have his
name deleted from the publication.

“The deadline for waivers is
Sept. 30, and by then it would be

  too late to get the directory out,”

Voharas said.

The announcement to abandon
the project came at Wednesday’s
GPSA meeting.

In other business, chairman
Steve Williams announced his
resignation, effective the end of the
fall term. Williams will step down
because he will graduate. An
election to replace Williams will be
held at the December meeting.

Scheduled for later meetings are
discussions of three proposed
by-law revisions. The revisions
include expanding eligibility for the
office of chairman to all graduate
students instead of limiting it to the
14-member GPSA council.

“By working as vice-chairman,
I've met people not on the Council
who should have the chance to run
for the chair. It gives the
impression of being elitist if we limit
the ofﬁce to council members
onlv.” Voharas explained.

"The by-laws now limit the pool
of availabile people. Under the
proposed revision, nominations for
chair must be made by a council

0 AGPSA Directory Scrapped  

member. That will provide some
sort of quality control, for the
candidates,” Voharas continued.

Other revisions include creating
an additional seat on the GPSA
council for the Interdisciplinary
Program and a provision that
states, “any shcool whose repre-
sentation has been less than ﬁfty
percent of the announced GPSA
Assembly meetings will forfeit
their funds for that term to GPSA. "

ﬁne enough distinctions between

students and does not represent a

totally accurate picture of how well a
student is doing,” "she continued.

“It is to the students’ beneﬁt to

have a ﬁner grading system.”

But the argument that ensued
indicated Baranger does not speak_
for all.

Neil Lien, a graduate student
member of the FAS Graduate
Council, feels there are larger
issues underneath the proposal.

“This proposal covers much
larger issues that involve the entire
grading system. The addition of
plus-minus grading makes an
already cumbersome grading sys-
tem worse. The relation between
graduate students and faculty is
different than that of undergrad-
uates and faculty. The grade
distinction is less important in
graduate school; there is less
emphasis on the ﬁner distinctions
between grades in graduate pro-
grams. If plus-minus grading is the
only way a student knows how well
she or he is doing, that in itself says
something about the quality of
Pitt’s graduate programs,” Lien
said. -

Gale McGloin, FAS Graduate’

Student Organization representa-
tive to the Graduate Council and
leader of opposition to the proposals
feels this issue is another example
of the bureaucracy of Pitt.

“I really don’t care about

plus-minus grading, but the
principle behind it is in question,”
McGloin said. “When this issue
ﬁrst came up, the Graduate Council
was. involved in much more
important issues, such as the
necessity for teaching assistant and
teaching fellow training and
evaluation, and the need for an
effective placement service for
graduate students. Issues that
matter just passed away unnoticed.
And then something as trivial as
plus-minus grading comes up and it
ends up before a full ‘faculty
meeting. I don’t understand the
rationale behind that.

‘‘All the faculty cares about are
grades. They forget about the need
for interaction with grad students,”
McGloin continued. “If people are
going to use the rhetoric that
graduate students are apprentices
to faculty and we’re here to learn,
then let’s learn and forget about all
this bureaucratic hogwash. This
issue reafﬁrms the feeling the
University is a bureaucratic mach-

.ﬁrst year graduate students. This
place is educationally dead and is
not intellectually stimulating. Stu-
dents feel alienated at Pitt,”
McGloin said.

Despite the opposition, the
proposal passed the Graduate
Council by a one-vote margin and
was presented to the full faculty
meeting in May. .

"At that meeting, McGloin
presented an alternate motion to
make all grading in FAS pass-fail,
with written comments.

“The issue was brought up at the
full faculty as sort of an
afterthought,” McGloin said.
“There was no quorum at the
meeting, so I called for a quorum
and the motion was tabled.”

A related issue arising from the
controversy was that the Graduate
Council and councils like
McGloin contended, don’t allow
their representatives time to
discuss the proposals with their
organizations.

As the issue now stands, the
‘plus-minus grading proposal will be
discussed and voted on again at a
full faculty meeting in October.

Baranger refused to speculate on
the results of the October vote.

“We’ll just have to wait and
see,” she said.

At F AS-GSO Meeting

The Faculty_ of ‘Arts and
Sciences-Graduate Student Organ-
ization (FAS-GSO) began accepting
nominations for officers and council
representatives at its meeting last
week. '

The nominating period will last
until noon on Friday, Sept. 30. At
that time, elections for the 1977-78
school year will take place.

Available positions include presi-
dent, vice-president and treasurer,
as- well as 13 representatives to
councils such as the University
Senate, the FAS Council and the
FAS Graduate Council.

All FAS graduate students are
eligible to run for office.

Information on nominations can be
obtained from the FAS-GSO "in
Room 1001, Cathedral of Learning.

In other business, discussion of
the organization’s draft. constitu-
tion and by-laws was postponed for
several weeks. Copies of the
constitution can be obtained at the
FAS-GSO office.

Rebecca Corlett was introduced
as the new administrative assis-
tant, and Jim’ Murphy was hired

Punk Rock’s And Sex Pistols Future Is Rotten 

By JIM FARERI

Punk rock is a lot like hell.
Everybody’s heard of it, but
nobody’s been there. There is even
some question about whether or not
punk rock exists. Few “punk
rockers” know themselves as such
and “punk-rockers” had nothing to

A do with the selection of their label.

But the term persists, as it is
more exotic, and often more
precise, than the proper but drab
option of the “New Wave.”

In general, punk rock comes in
two varieties: American and
British.

The American version came ﬁrst,
originating in New York and
diffusing to only one other city, L.A.
Punk bands may hail from
anywhere in the country, but NYC is
the only place where a band can eke
out a living as a band.

The New York scene began when
several bands found audiences at a
lower Manhatten bar called
CBGB’s. A community of
performers, promoters, and fans
emerged and the label “punk rock’ ’
was dusted off and applied anew by
rock critics.

Dumping these bands into one
pigeonhole is tempting because
they play in the same places and
share attitudes and fans. But
musically they are diverse; it is
reductive to put any two in the same
box.

Patti Smith, the godmother of
New York punk rock, plays
interpretative, experimental rock.
Blondie couples 60’s sounds with a
tough, 70’s, consciousness. The
Ramones take a less-is-more
approach, mixing a few chords, pop
pretension and speed into a bullet
aimed at the heart of teenage
frustration. Television works with
rock as Picasso worked with paint,
abandoning any straight-forward-
ness for the subtleties of mood and
image. Mink DeVille invites street
romanticism and Spanish ethnicity
into their music.

These performers all have one or
two albums out; many more New
York/L.A. bands are in the stages
that lead up to a recording contract.

The Clash

Many more are vying for that

. privilege.

Listen to these bands, and it
doesn't take long to realize that
“punk rock” is being used as a new
substitute for ‘ ‘underground rock. ’ ’
These bands all work outside of the
mainstream, but that leaves a lot of
distance between neighbors.

Where American punk rock is
varied, decentralized and much
more that one phrase can capture,
the British version of punk is
uniform, cohesive, and perhaps
worthy of a single tag.

The English New Wave took its
ﬁrst breath when a few far-sighted
Englishmen got their first look at
the Ramones. British youth are in a
stinking way, in terms of employ-
ment, living conditions, recreation
—everything. If the Ramones
epitomize American frustration and
boredom, teetering on the verge of
insanity and violence, imagine what
a British equivalent could do with
the sad state of English youthl

So Malcolm McClaren put
together the Sex Pistols, the ﬁrst
principals of U.K. punk and the
biggest thing to hit England since
the U-2.

The Sex Pistols aim at the
jugular, not just with lashing,
high-caliber rock, but with lyrics
and stance hot enough to get the
group banned from the BBC.

The Pistols are four angry,
violent, nihilistic young men of
about 20, led by vocalist Johnny
Rotten (I am an anti-Christ l /I am an
anarchistl). They point to anarchy
and destruction as both an
alternative and consequence of
working-class English life.

After the Sex Pistols set up shop,
U.K. punk bands began prolifera-
ting as fast as -rabbits on vitamin E.
Styles in dress, like torn clothing
and short hair, emerged as a
reaction to the rich, meaningless
generation of rock stars gone before
(summed-up in the person of Mick
Jagger), and became as important
to the English punk as his
rediscovery of me ’n’roll.

British punk characteristically
contains the essentials, tuned and
pitched to a deadly maximum.

A Gold Mine
For Green Stamps

By JIM FARERI

Import albums are a buck or two
more than homegrown, but in the
case of The Clash, a buck or two well
spent. Buying The Clash’s debut
LP “The Clash” is like getting ‘a
gold mine for a book of green
stamps. ‘

This album clears up any
misrepresentations of British punk
rock as inept noise-making. The
Clash are as young, angry and
distraught as any punk band—but
they play their instruments, don’t
ﬁght them, and write fresh,
exceptional rock’n’roll.
don’t throw together a few chords.

“The Clash” is comprised of
fourteen songs: thirteen originals
by Joe Strummer (guitar, vocals)

     

They just V

and Mick Jones (lead guitar, vocals)
plus a six-minute reggae tune,
“Police And Thieves,” written by
Junior Murvin. Punk has a lot of
empathy for reggae, and the
Murvin piece ﬁts well in The lash
repertoire,
socially.

The Strummer/Jones collection
is a grab bag of two- to three-minute
‘bursts of rock perfection. The Clash
sound, most importantly, is new
rhythms, crafted in an innovative
style and played deadly fast.

Lead guitar often picks out the
rhythm, sometimes ﬁlling in the
gaps, sometimes indulging in
melody. But melody is not needed
or wanted, since the inventive
rhythmic structures of Strummer
and Jones themselves approach
melodies.

Guitar solos are strictly a la punk:
no longer than a gasp, but as
effective as,,.a stick of dynamite.
However, the‘ bass play of Paul
Simonon is strictly averse to popular
punk trends: Simonon leaves the
bottom line to drummer Tory
Crimes and slaps out the rhythm
with the guitarists.

It’s senseless to talk about the
best cuts on the album: each one is
a favorite at one time or another and

(Continzied on Page /2)

both musically and '

Songs rarely exceed aufew minutes
and concentrate only on the basics:
guitar solos, if any, come in
10-second bursts. The chorus is
usually the choice part of the
song—overbearing and climactic.
Notable bands with albums out
(in the U.K.) include The Clash, The
Damned, the Jam and The
Vibrators: bands cut from the Sex
Pistol cloth, but each with a
different angle and style of play.
Punk rock, as it exists in England,
is on the threshold of breaking
through to a wider, more cosmopol-
itan audience. The Sex Pistols, who
were successively dumped by two
reactionary record companies, are
just now coming out with their ﬁrst
album. If released in U.S., it could
bring an English punk invasion.
On the other hand, American
punk rock (with the exception of the
Ramones) is too far off the beaten
path to hope for large followings.
But this is ﬁne; these bands were
made for small, interested audien-
ces. However, FM listeners should
be disturbed because such fresh,
virile music is being denied airplay.
Little audiences are one thing;
obscurity is another.

L

British rockster Johnny Rotten and his group The Sex Pistols are the impetus

for punk rock.

“Animation Festival”

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Animation Festival
King’s Court

“Animation Festival” is an
assortment of short sequences from
a variety of animators in England,
France, Italy and the United States.
Each segment is totally different
and unique in plot, as well as
artistry and music.

C

#3

There are sequences of color and
multi-shaded patterns that ﬂash on
screen like a continuously moving
kaliedoscope: these sequences
serve as breaks between with story
cartoons.

The highlight of the show was an
animated version of Cat Stevens’
song ‘ ‘ Moonshadow. ’ ’ Stevens
wrote the story as well as the song
and the whimsical drawings that
often grace his album covers
magically come to life in the tale of
Teaser and the Firecat, who get
trapped on the moon. This short
ﬁlm, narrated by British comedian
Spike Milligan, is an absolute
delight. .

Another good short subject is
“The Cat's Cradle, which features
art similar to the Beatle cartoon
“Yellow Submarine.” This story

concerns a spider who converts its
web into a stringy cat’s cradle that
protects the Holy Family from an
advancing army.

There are two sequences that are
more like puppets than cartoons.
The ﬁrst is a world of clay where
mud men eventually emerge from
the ground to learn to crawl, then
walk and ﬁnally sprout wings to ﬂy.
The second, “Mountain Music,”
starts out in a forest where a trio of
folksingers are playing soft music.
As the sequence progresses, their
instruments gradually become
more advanced and the sound
becomes more deafening until it
touches off a volcano.

Other ﬁlms were bleak and
despairing particularly a French
entry about a creature half woman
and half bird——that stands in front
of a man’s house continuously.
Colored only in dull blues and grays
(except for the golden light of the
street lamp illuminating the crea-
ture) with the sound of rain pouring
down, it foreshadows the creatures
ultimate, bloody demise.-

A few ﬁlms were vagﬁﬁ
amateurish; one, from the UCLA
workshop focused on a creature that
spends its entire life trying to open a
door. When it ﬁnally collapses from
a heart attack, the door opens to
reveal an ironing board.

Pryor In Prime Time:

Zany New Show 

By THERESA RAIMOND

Clever, colorful and creative all
add up to a capital C in comedy as
Richard Pryor does it again. His
material is so alive that the viewer
is inclined to go along, whether he
had planned to or not. Richard
Pryor can switch from an African
tribesman to a white southern
attorney with the subtle grace and
charm only a master of comedy
could have.

Pryor’s comedy also conveys a
message. Portraying the only black

member of an archaeological
expedition, Pryor discovers, in an
ancient Egyptian tomb, that the
book of life was actually written by
black men. Consequently, the
white expedition members entomb
him in the ancient grave, burying
his newly-found black beginnings
'with him. In this skit, Pryor
manages to make light of the white
man’s reaction to a very real
possibility.

Pryor seems to be able to try on
any role he wishes and wear it well.

Trudeau Wins “As TheKid GoesFor Broke ”,..,

By PATTY TASCARELLA

As The Kid Goes For Broke
By Garry Trudeau
Holt, Rinehart and Winston

“As The Kid Goes For Broke"
brings the number of Garry
Trudeau's Doonesbury books to an
even dozen in ﬁve years. While the
quality of these cartoon adventures
has varied. Trudeau’s latest effort
is on target and hits hard.

“As The Kid Goes For Broke” is
a grab bag, with something for
everyone. There’s a Wayne
Hayes———type congressman who
(after winning re-election over
Ginny Slade) is revealed to be a

Rate Import

rock fans are bound to love them all.
Titles representative of The Clash
philosophy include “Remote Con-
trol” (the government has “remote
control” over the working class),
“London’s Burning” (“...with
boredom nowl), and “Career
Opportunities” (“...the ones that
never’ knocked’ ’).

There is a lot of lyric. Sentiments
are not just ﬁred at the audience;
ideas are transmitted. Unfortun-
ately, Strummer’s gruff, expressive
oockney is foreign to American ears,
although often his tone is more than
enough.

It has been said that British punk
is too culture-bound and full of U.K.
politics to be translatable in the U. S.
The Clash smash that notion into
oblivion with the universal appeal of
rock’n’rol1.

Punk is makin the world safe for
task, and The glasli, with 5 new
music that commands instant
dedication, are making rock safe for
punk.

GrantA Success Minus Mary

By THERESA RAIMOND

Thepremiere of “The Lou Grant
Show” was a bit different than
expected. The approach to this
new series is a realistic one.
Although he remains a professional
newsman. the character of Lou
Grant (Edward Asner) changes as
the sweetness of his previous role
gives way to the ruggedness of the
true newsman.

i There also are some episodes

Lacey and Dick Davenport (the
elderly couple who met at their
50th class reunion). and a slew of
Washington sketches ranging from
Jimmy Carter catching frogs in
Miss Lillian's back_\yard to the
Presidential debates.

Best of all are the return of
quarterback B.D.'s football huddle
and science whiz Bernie's trip to
Scotland to search for the Loch
Ness Monster. Bernie makes his
trip for “implies science” credits.

What's missing is the complete
knot of original characters: Mike

viewer is acquainted with the ugly,
more true-to-life stories that a
newsman encounters. As city
editor of a Los Angeles newspaper,
Grant has more prestigious air than
the Grant of the WJM-TV
newsroom. He deals admirably
with the fast-moving world of
news.

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt offensive line coach Don
Boyce is optimistic, yet wary, when
it comes to praising his offensive
line.

“No one can afford to get hurt,”
he said of his starting ﬁve. “We
don’t have the depth. We’ve
improved 100 percent in the last two
weeks, but we just don’t have the
depth.”

That Boyce is worried about his
substitutes is amazing; before the
season began, experts predicted he

L-~~».,,..would have enough problems just

I teaching his starters how to block.
“They said that (left tackle Art)
Bortnick, (left guard Jim) Buoy, and
(right guard George) Link couldn't
play college caliber’ football,”
Boyce accused, “but we’ve dis-
proved that. Only (right tackle)
Matt Carroll and (center) Tom
Brzoza have really played in a
college game before, so we’ve spent
a lot of time in meetings going over
plays. Everyone has improved
tremendously, but we must do
better if we want to be national
champion again.”
Boyce had comments about all
the members of his line, a line that

  helped Pitt to 446 total yards and 28

‘points against William and Mary.
About Bortnick: “Art was the
offensive player of the week against
the Indians. Although he’s only a
ﬁrst-year starter, he has come to the
front as a leader on the line.”
About Buoy: “He always gives a
lot of effort. He’s gone through
games all taped up—a physical
wreck, but he gives it all he’s got.”
About Carroll: “Matt played well
last year, but this season he’s doing
even better at offensive tackle.”
About Link: »“He’s such a strong
kid. Jim’s only a first-year starter,
but when he decides to do

,a~~}<_;mething like make a block," he’s

beatable.”
' About sub Mark May: “Ifthere’s
a youngster in America -who has to
be anall-America, it’s him-he has
a chance to be a great player. If he
improves, he may be starting for
Pitt—-we won’t be able to keep him
out of the lineup.”

     

But of all the good comments
directed at the “know-nothing”
gang (Sherrill’s nickname for the
line; most are ﬁrst-year starters, so
compared to more experienced
players in the other positions, they
“know nothing”), the most im-
pressive went to Brzoza.

‘ ‘Brzoza’s been doing better than
I’ve seen him do at Pitt,” Boyce
remarked. “When the year’s over,
he’ll be the best center I'll have
coached. I’ve had the opportunity
to coach three all-America centers
(Tom Rohany, Kay Mendenhall and
R. C. Tillman), but Brzoza has more
talent and a better attitude—he’ll
be the best I’ve coached.”

Despite his praises, Boyce isn't
satisﬁed with what the offensive
line has showed him.

“We’ve got along way to go,” he
stressed. “If we don’t function, the
offense doesn’t function—anyone
who knows offensive football knows
that.”

One man who knows that is
Temple coach Wayne Hardin,
whose team lacked offense in its
24-20 opening-day loss to Southern
Illinois, but found hope in a 48-0
stomping of Drake.

“Our offense improved last
week,” Hardin said.‘ “Two weeks
ago it was not good at all. We’ll
have to execute this week. We're a
young team playing the national
champions and all we hope to do is
keep our composure and improve
like we’ve been doing.”

One part of the Owls’ squad that
has improved since they were last
year’s 21-7 losers at Pitt Stadium is
the offensive line.

“The offensive line is the best
part of Temple's team,” Pitt coach
Jackie Sherrill stated. “'I”hey’re
always able to get up for us and do
the right things.”

. Hopefully; the Panthers offensive
line can again help out with the
(scoring chores, forit seems Pitt will
need a ton of points to climb back

into the Associated Press’ Top 20, a

list it was dropped from despite
winning last Saturday’s game by 22
points.

“If ‘we had won 50-0 against
William and Mary, we wouldn’t

If the offensive line is any

Jacobs A -Doors Job  

By KAREN KADILAK

Pitt football player Fred Jacobs,
who starts his second straight game
at tailback against Temple in
Philadelphia on Saturday, ﬁnds
himself in a revolving door; he must

. produce or step aside and let

someone else take over one of the
most critical positions in the
Panthers’ attack.

It’s a situation Larry Sims faced
several weeks ago against Notre
Dame. He took his turn on the
revolving door and had to get off, for
he didn’t produce the way Pitt head
coach Jackie Sherrill and offensive
backﬁeld coach Joe Moore hoped he
would.

On stepped Jacobs. The
sophomore running back from
Cincinnati, Ohio, performed the
way both Sherrill and Moore hoped

The Panthers, ranked eighth in the nation last season, expect even better
things this yearns they vie for the University's second national title in two

years.

Sims would have against the Irish,
rushing for 98 yards in the
Panthers’ 28-6 win over William
and Mary last weekend. Needless
to say, Jacobs hasn’t stepped off
yet.

But he realizes it’ s a situation that
could change. Like Sims, he could
be pushed aside in favor of another
tailback. Steve Harris, Artrell
Hawkins and Sims himself are the
leading candidates if Jacobs does
falter.

However, if left to Jacobs, the
situation never would occur. He
likes starting too much to sit on the
bench, as he did all last season.

‘‘It was terrible,” Jacobs ex-
plained. ‘ ‘You’re used to playing all
the time in high school, and all of a
sudden, you a_ren’t playing that
much. It seems like you’re missing
something——missing all the excite-
ment. I guess that’s what it is.

‘ ‘But you have to hang in there,”
he continued. “You have to think
you’re going to play. That one day,

you just might start. That’s why I’m
trying my best not to give this-up. I
want to start—it’s the greatest
feeling in the world.” “\

But wanting to start and actually
starting are two different things.
It’s a situation Jacobs, realizes.

“We all realize it," he claimed.
“Larry, Steve and Artrell-we're
all football players and we want to
play. So I'm going to make the most
of the situation.’ Larry had his
chance to start—-now it’s my turn. I
beat out some pretty good football
players, but they can beat me out,
too. It’s all in the game. It’s
competition. It’s what makes this
such a nice game-

“For now,” Jacobs added, “I’m
just going to do my best and let the
pieces fall where they may. What
happens happens.”

Jacobs realizes that if something
not so good happens tomorrow
against Temple, the revolving door
could change. He won’t ﬁnd
himself in it; he'll probably ﬁnd
himself looking out of it.

Water Poloists Ready
For Pitt Invitational

By BOB LABRIOLA

Although they toil in relative
obscurity. Pitt's water polo team
has the best chance of bringing a
national title to the University this
year.

The Panther credentials are
impressive: ﬁve of seven starters
are returning from the squad that
ﬁnished eighth in the nation a year
ago; in all. nine letterment are
back. Five members of the I976
team were chosen all-East and four
of them. George Machiote, Mike
Mere. Butch Silva and Luis Toro,
return for the 1977 campaign.

Pitt will open the season, hosting
the Pitt Invitational on Sept. 23-25.
According to past results and
pre-season evaluations, theiteams
Competing in the Invitational are
among the best in the country.
Participants in the weekend tourna-
ment will be Bucknell, Ohio State,
Penn State, Indiana, Cornell,
Army, Slippery Rock and Akron.

“Bucknell was Eastern cham-
pion in 1974 and 1975 before we
beat them out last year,” explained
Coach Miguel Rivera. “Ohio State
is favored to win the Big 10, -Cornell.
is the Ivy League favorite and Army

The women’s cross country team
Sunday will travel to Penn State,
where it will be challenged by seven
teams in a 5,000-meter or 3.1 mile
‘race. The teams competing will be
Penn State, Maryland, Lock Haven,
Rutgers, Villanova and a team from
the Catholic Youth Organization
(CYO).

The Penn State team will offer
Pitt some very stiff competition.
Before the season started, Penn
State was ranked ﬁrst in the East
and third in the nation. One reason

is that last year’s entire team will
return, along with two talented
freshmen.

Rutgers and CYO also will be
tough competition, according to Pitt
coach Freda Goff. Rutgers is a new
team, like Pitt, but it has some good
runners. CYO also has some
nationally-ranked runners.

Last weekend the Pantherettes
ﬁnished second out of a ﬁeld of six
schools in an event in which over 50
runners competed. Therese
Walton, who ﬁnished ﬁfth in that
race, said, “This weekend’s race
should be easier. The course will be
ﬂatter and we are leaving early so

we’ll have time to walk through it. ’ ’

. By walking through a course, the
girls Judge how fast to run the
various stages of the race. Thus
they increase the chance of
winning.

At the California State meet last
week, the Pantherettes didn’t have
time to walk throughthe course.
Both Walton and Becky Falck feel
this affected their performance
adversely.

This Sunday’s meet should be a
challenge for the girls and although
nobody can predict the outcome,
they should be readyito accept the
challenge.

is always a powerhouse. Slippery
Rock is number one in Division II
and Indiana is always among the
best at the NCAA swimming
championships.

“Our match with Indiana will be
a classic." Rivera predicted.
“They rely on aggressive. fast
swimming, while I feel we must
play under control and eliminate
mistakes to win. Iguess you could
compare it to a basketball game
between Nevada-Las Vegas and
UCLA.”

The Panthers will compete in an
eight-team league comprised of

mond. Fordham. LaSj1lle and

Eastern championships. The

premier team from the East then 

proceeds to the Nationals.

“Stanford was number one last
year." Rivera said. “but since they
lost their coach and. some key
players. I don’t think they can
repeat. I look for California
(Berkeley). UCLA and California
(Irvine) to be very tough. but if we
don’t finish at least ﬁfth in the
nation. I'll be very disappointed.”

Pitt’s potential Achilles heel
could be at goalie. where all-East
Walt Young, who has graduated.
will be replaced by freshman Steve
Feller. Feller. however. is touted
as the best goalie ever produced by
a Pittsburgh-area high school. p

“The team is very excited about
Steve because we feel he has more
talent and potential right now then
Walt did as a senior,” Rivera said.

Pantherettes Net Victory

By CINDY NATALI

The Pantherette tennis team won
its season opener against Edinboro,
8-1, dropping only one of the
doubles matches yesterday at Trees
Courts.

A team of six veteran players and
three freshmen reinforced Coach
Nancy Gordon’s optimistic view of
this season by its performance.

The singles lineup, consisting

entirely of returning players, sent .
Pitt into the doubles competition 3
with a 6-0 lead over the Scots. The i ,
outstanding match of the day was 3

played by Nancy Ballestreri in the ‘ " V

fourth singles position. Winning a 
grueling match that lasted 2‘/2 1.

hours, Ballestreri was dubbed by

Gordon as the best player of the i 0
According to Gordon, *

day.
Ballestreri worked very hard to
defeat her opponent, who is a
freshman from Sweden and a “real
steady player.” '

Number-one player Maria Paris A ’

defeated Sue Trzcinka in straight

sets, 6-0, 6-1 and Janet DeCostro L
followed with a 6-1 , 6-1 victory over ’

Barb Wolfson. In Pitt's third
position, Janis Irwin won, 6-1, 6-0.
Pam Bachman defeated Mary
Hunbelf in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1,

with Jan Brownstein ﬁnishing off  '

Terri Reynolds, 6-2, 6-2.

Irwin and Bachman teamed in the J

ﬁrst doubles match to defeat Sanay,
McCarthy and Hunkele, 6-1, 6-2.
After splitting sets, 7-5, 3-6, Lisa
Brownstein and freshman Jennifer
McNally triumphed with a ﬁnal 6-4
set over Tammy Reynolds and
Kathy McDuff.

The sole Panther loss came in the
third doubles match as the
freshman duo of Lois Moses and
Jennifer Mullan held off Betty
Shultz and Wolfson until the ﬁnal
set, 6-2, 0-6, 6-1.

Ballestreri sat out the doubles
competition for a rest after her
lengthy contest. This gave younger
players a chance to gain experience.
Although she feels that her team's
doubles play still needs work,
Gordon was still pleased with its
performance.

“The singles just played beauti-
fully,” Gordon said. “I couldn’t
have asked for more.” She added
the Edinboro had a lot of strong
players.

Beginning her third season as
coach, Gordon commented that she
has never seen the team look better
in the early season.

Mark May, freshman offensive line offensive line coach Don Boyce. “lf Boyce claimed before leaving for
sensation, has shown much promise there is a youngster in America who
so far this season, according to Pitt has to be an all-Amerlca _, it's May,”

 

Maria Paris, the Pantherettes, number-one singles player, was in top form
against Edinboro yesterday, shellacking the Scots’ Sue Trzcinka, 6-0, 6-1, to
help lead Pitt to an easy 8-1 victory.

“I’m pleased with the condition PITT HOME SPORTS
the players are in and how well they
are hitting,” she added.

The netters tomorrow will face FridaY“5°°°er‘ ‘’5- Sup‘

Lock Haven, who, along with the ‘pe"y_ R°°k- 7 P-mu Pitt’
University of Maryland, is one of Sta_d"‘f“- Water P010. Pitt
theirtoughest competitors. Gordon Inwtauonal (Bucknenl Ohio

5tat€, Penn State, lndiana,
C01‘n€“. Army. Slippery Rock
and Akron) Trees Pool,

anticipates a good match.

With her “solid team,” Gordon
hopes to improve the doubles play
this season and do well in the
tournaments. The team will take
part in three tourneys, including the
East College Tournament in New
York, the Garﬁnkel Tournament
and the Salisbury Invitational, both
in Maryland. .

An additional asset to this year’s
team is assistant coach Erma Tytka.
Gordon feels Tytka, in her ﬁrst year
of coaching, has been a big help,
alllowing the players more indiv-
idual attention.

The team has four home matches
and hosts Slippery Rock on
Monday.
