IIAN.III-MANDIIEIN CLUB

Many students attended the ﬁrst re-

which was held last evening.

‘ John G. Arnold is in charge and de-
sires to have any Evening School
students join who have not already
done so.

The mandolin club plans to add in-
terest to the many social affairs that
are planned for members of the Even-
ing School Association this year.

up AND unwll PLAYS
MUST BE SUBMITTED
F BY NIIVEMBEII 624

The Cap and Gown Club decided
that any person desiring to submit a
play, lyrics or music to be used by
the club in this year’s production,
may do so. Material will be accepted
up to Thanksgiving.

Sidney Hoehl, graduate manager of
non-athletic activities, has arranged
so that all material ~submitted will
b numbered, ‘and the name of the
a thor will be withheld from the
committee which will evaluate the
material -submitted. The plays, lyrics
and music will be judged according
to merit, and no partiality will be
shown in; making a decision. A Fresh-
man has as «much chance to have his
material accepted as h-as an upper
classman, and it is urged that anyone
having ability in these lines will sub-
mit ’ material.

The personnel of the evaluating
committee will not be made known
until after the decisions have been
made, so that no one may claim that
the committee was unduly prejudiced‘
in the favor of any person submit-
ting material.

The following points will be taken
into consideration when the work
submitted is judged: (1) Merit of the
work submitted; (2) Adaptability to
-production by students; (3) Adapta-
bility for staging.

Material may be left at Mr. Hoehl’s
office, Room 1, State Hall.

VOnly one side of the paper should
be used, and if possible, the material
should be typewritten. The author's
name and address should be on the
work, on a separate piece of paper.

‘Try outs for the cast will be gov-
erned by the .same rules that govern
the plays. Parts ‘will be given accord-
ing to merit only, and not on the.
past record of candidates.

EIIIITIIA.I.L SYMBDIIZES- -
MANY IDEALS DE PITT

-“That football at Pitt symbolizes
the energy, drive, success and spirit
of team play which the University
wishes to‘ make a. vital part of every
classroom recitation and every facul-
ty meeting” was the keynote struck
by Chancellor Bowman in address-

_ ing the football squad as his guests

at dinner at the University Club last
Thursday evening, November 3. The
entire University squad, coaches
and managers met as the Chancel-
l.or’s guests and heard him an-
nounce the University's complete
support of Pitt’s athletic program
and received his congratulations on
the success of the Pitt teams.

‘A, R. Hamilton, ’93, a. member of
the Athletic Council and of the Uni-
versity's Board of Trustees, told of
the old days of football at Pitt,
and of the hardships and difficulties
which had to be overcome before
our teams were recognized pas
worthy opponents for other schools.
Floyd Rose, “'96, who assists Pop
Warner in coaching the squad, spoke
of the harmony and good-fellowship
which prevails among coaches and
players, and paid .,;tribute to Glenn
Warner as the “all-American coach.

Ca S. Miller, director of Athletics
Captain Tom Davies. and Tom Ho-
leran, expressed to the ‘Chancellor

\their appreciation of his recognition

of their services to the University,
and promised their full support to
make football at Pitt a clean and
going concern, of which the Uni-
versity would ever be proud. Pop
Vvarner was introduced by Doctor
Bowman as “the greatest coach .wl2

ever stood in shoe leather,’'. and Pop
responded effectively by paying just
praise to his squad of playeis, in-
cluding the second and third‘ string
‘men who have done so much to
‘make the season a success.

That football at Pitt .syImbolizes in
spectacular form many of the ideals
of the University was» received by
the squad and coaches with great
-enthusiasm, and with a just, sense
of their responsibility to worthily
represent Pitt on the gridiron and
off. The players, as a team, and
individuglly. voted Chancellor Bow-
man to be a regular guy and told
him so in emphatic terms.

-there is going to be a big Pitt get together at the Hotel Schenley that

expect to see Saturday's great battle.

For some reason there is always ’an inclination to wait until the
last minute to go to a football game.

If this is done Saturday and there is a last minute rush, many
won't see the kickoff or the first 10 minutes of play. ‘

A Colorful Game.

With thousands of alumni of both
Pitt and W. 8; J. at the game Sat-
urday it should certainly be a cot-
orful affair. Pitt alumni roters will
be in the right wing of the stands,
with several cheerleaders to direct
them. In the alternate sections of
the stands will be the students’ fam-
ilies, all of them 100 per cent for
Old Pitt, so that there should be a
solid section of Pitt noise makers
from Section 1 to Section 10.

The W. as J, alumni motors will
be in the left wing, or third base
side Practically all of “Little"
Washington will be up for~ the game

and, as usual, they will make their

presence known. The W. & J. ‘stu-
dent section, with ‘a capacity of
500», has been assigned to the spe-
cial right field bleachers, adjacent
to section 1 of the stands. W. &
J. will have a band/ with them to
foot.» against the great Pitt Student
Essa. I i

There will be numerous rooting
features, arranged by the Pitt and
 &" J. c’heerie‘aders:. All in all, it

will be ‘a bitterly fought -but friendly 

battle between the old rivals; and,
judging by comparative: scores
either side has a chance for victory
Pitt may not be in the best of
shape for the game but in at W. &
J. battle a, Pitt man, be he substi-
tute or regular, usually comes
through with his best playing. The
same usually holds good with W.

a. wire return of the- play through the

alumni office. A letter from the pres-
ident, James S. Gleghorn, tells of the
plans, the W. & J. alumni of that
city being invited to join with them
on this occasion. Copy of the notice
sent to Detroit grads. is given below:

former students, wives, sweethearts

and friends are invited to attend. An

invitation has been extended to W. 8:‘
J. alumni and friends living in Detroit
and vicinity to join the Pittites on
this occasion. ‘Returns of the game
will be received by wire during the
dinner. Those in charge of the at-

the Pitt Faculty Dancing Club was
organized. lt is planned to have
dances on alternate Tuesday even-
ings in Mellonlnstitute. Arrange-
ments have been made to have in-
struction given during the first part
of each evening by one of the best
teachers of dancing in the country.
Plans also include provision for
very good music. All members of
the faculty together with their fam-
invited to join the club.
During the winter several formal
dances will be given also. The next
dance will be on Tuesday evening,
November‘ 15, at eight o'clock. The
faculty members of the various
schools are asked to extend the in-
vitation to other members of their

T'he Cosmopolitan Club of
Univers.ty which organized
year plans another active year.

The purposes of the club are to

 

the
last

fellowship amongst its members, to
promote sympathetic international
understanding and world brother-
hood, and to establish and cultivate
a closer, friendlier and more cordial
intercourse between the foreign and
American students at Pitt.

The club is composed: of sixty-
eight members representing Austria,
China, Colombia. Czecho-Slovakia,
France, _ Honduras, India, Italy,
Japan, Lithuania, Palestine, Philip-
pine Islands, Poland, Porto Rico,’
Roumania, Russia,-Scotland and the
United States of America.

The regular meetings are held on
the ﬂrst and third Thursday
evening of every month ‘in the Y.
W. C. A. Hospitality House. In ad-
dition to the business transacted at
each meeting, a program is prepared
consisting usually of a musical num-
»ber and an informal ‘talk. A dis-
cussion of the topography, customs,
manners, government and politics of
one country is presented by its rep-
rescnta.-tive at each meeting. Con-
sults, vice consuls and various men
‘interested in international affairs
are. also procured as speakers.

The club also maintains dramatic,
musical and literary departments’
whose eflcrts successfully brought‘
about a public entertainment held in
the Carnegie Music Hall. The pro-
gram consisted of the recitation of
“Mary Had a Little Lamb” in elev-'
en‘ different languages, national"
dances, musical selections and play;
lets in Englis-h and French. Period-
ically a meeting night is assigned to

representatives to enable it to pre-
sent an entertainment, VVl.liCl1 in its

nation. For example the following
nights have already been set aside:
Hebrew Night, Italian Night, Rou-
manlan Night and French Night. Oc-
casionally the club holds dances for
its members and their friends. At
the beginning of the fall term a
reception and dance vvas given in
honor of the foreign students at
tending the various colleges in
Pittsburgh, which included the 0

Pennsylvania College for Womélﬁ,
and Duquesne University.

The following officers have beer
elected for the school year 1921-52:

An entertainment very similar to
the one presented last year has been
planned to be held in the Carnegie

~SENTENCES

There are still a. few‘ feminine of
fenders in the Freshman class who
refuse to obey rules, a.nd these cu‘.
prits were sentenced by the Senior
Court of the W’, S. G. A. on Fri-
day.

One girl was ordered to Wear 21

disloyal Pitilte,” and also to wear
white stockings. Thesentences im-
posed on two of the girls were

One was told to wear green stock-
ings and a white oil cloth bib, and
the other to carry a teddy bear dec-
orated with a._ green ribbon.

After the Nebraska game some of
the Freshman girls left the stands
during the singing of “Alma Mater”
and these girls will have to appear
before the court.

HIINR ERADUATES Tl]

Realizing, the need of increased
public recognition of «scholarship
and of higher scholastic standing in
the University, the honoi graduates
of the undergraduate schools since
1915 when honors were first award-
ed. met in Room 208, Alumni Hall on
Friday evening of last' week to ‘con-
sider what steps might be taken in
that direction. .

More than 40 former honor stu-
dents attended the meeting, among
them being many whose names
stand high in the annals of Pitt ac-
tivities. In addition to those at-.
tending, 25 sent regrets that they
could not attend because of the dis-
tance, but all pledged. their support
to the movement_

 

 

In order to form a basis for activ-

ity, a committee was appointed to
draw up a. constitution and to sub-

mit it for the consideration of the’

organization. This committee is
composed of J.‘— Steele Gow, '16,
chairman; J. P. Herron (“Pat”),
Col., ’15; Louise Callan, Col., '16;
Robert B, Bossler, Mines, ’18; Mary
J. Baird‘, ‘Col., ’18; Bertha Z. Young,
Ed., ’15, and Todd F. Buzard, Ec.,
’16. The committee is expected t.o
report at the next meeting ‘of the
group, to be held on Friday even-
ing, November 18, at 8 o’clock, in
Room 208, Alumni Hall.

The purposes of the new organi

, zation as expressed Friday night
are to bind togetlier the honor
graduates to each other and to

their Alma Mater; -"to ﬁnd some way
of giving greater public recognition
to students who attain honor; and
to take whatever steps may pre-
sent themselves toward the encour-

agement and improvement of svchol- A

arship ant‘ scholastic attainment.
The response to this call for organ-
ization was enthusiastic, according
to Prof. Sage, who was in large part
responsible for the meeting, and
points to a work of deﬁnite service
to Pitt. The authorities ha.ve been
considering such an organization for

some time. and the work of com-.

piling a directory of honor grad-
uates_ was carried on last year.
E!/ery class since 1915, when the
custom of awarding honors at the
University was instituted, was rep-
resented at the conference Friday
night, and
school, with the exception of En-
gineering, was represented as well.

TII BISARMAMENT
IIIINFERENEE

It was decided in the Student Sen-
ate meeting last ,Wednesday to send
a delegate to the Disarmament Con-
ference to which all universities have
been requested to send a delegate. A
special meeting ,will be held this week
to select the Pitt representative.

A complaint has been registered by

both students and faculty in regard
to loitering that has been going on in
the halls and at the entrance of
Alumni Hall.‘ This condition is con-
trary to Pitt spirit and a committee
was appointed to take charge of’ the
matter and report at-the next meet-
mg.
Discussion of the lax enforcement
of Freshmen rules by the Sophomores
was next in‘ order. The president of
the Student Senate was empowered
to call a special meeting of the Soph-
.)more class to present the cause to
them. Continued laxity may result in
the discintinuation of the regulations
and the Freshmen will be allowed to
do as they please.

strongest yearling teams in the

ISPANISH CLUB MEETS

   

A meeting of the Spanish club will
be held this afternoon at 1 o'clock
in the lecture room on the second

Jean McCrum_. ’l9', and Margaret floor of Aluinfii Hall.
King, ’20. The Spanish club of the University
Announcements will go out to of Pittsburgh was organized with the

following ends in view:

.1. To establish a meeting place for
students interested in Spanish life,
language and literature, including not
only those students who are taking
classes in Spanish, but alsothose who
come from ‘Spanish speaking coun-
tries.

2 To give students insight into the
Spanish life and custom such as they
would not receive in the classroom.

3. To co-operate with business men
dealing in foreign trade with Spain
and Spanisli-American countries. ,

,4. To foster in those not already
interested a desire to learn the Span-
ish language. =

The aims of the club were express-
ed in the programs of meetings held
last year. The customs and manners
of Spain and Latin America were por-
trayed in plays, music, dances and
games. Speeches were delivered on
Latin American politics and trade re-
lations. Translation work was secur-
ed for several of the members of the
club and steps were taken for estab-
lishing a translation bureau.

‘While many of the accomplishments
for which the club worked were not
fully realized during the past year.
it is felt that a foundation has been
laid upon which it may build during
the coming year.

DAVIS

 

The Keith vaudeville bill at the
Davis Theater next week, beginning
Monday afternoon, November 15, and
including daily matinees, will pre-

 sent a galaxy of international stars

in a range. of acts that-will embrace
all the angles of theatrical art. Irene
Bordoni, the fascinating Franco-ItaL
ian star from “Sleeping Partners,”
“Miss Information” _and ‘,‘As You
Were,” is to render a cycle of Ameri-
can, French and ‘Spanish songs, to
piano accompaniment by Jacque
Grandei. Miss Bordoni is an inset)-
ciant young woman with wonderful
eyes, a sweet voice, slim pretty ﬁgure

and all the chic commonly attributed -

Parisienne chanteuses. It will be but
her second vaudeville engagement in
Pittsburgh, the ﬁrst having occurred
some years ago in company with the
late Melville Ellis. She hasalso been
a co-star with Raymond Hitchcock
in “Hitchy-Koo,” and is just now re-
garded as one of the most accom-
plished, interesting and entertaining
young women in the theater in
America.

Ben Welch, the favorite character
comedian who was last ‘seen with
Frances White in “Jimmie,” is to re-
appear in vaudeville with Frank P.
Murphy in “Pals,” an original char-
acter study. In it Mr. Welch will
introduce his audience to the rough,
low caste, but exceedingly interesting
and witty Hebrew types.

Broadway’s dainty and petite star,
Edith Taliafenro, with a splendid sup-
porting company, is to play “Under
the Same Old Moo'n,~” a love tale of
three continents written and staged
for her by Kenneth Webb. It has
music by Roy Webb and is in three
episodestwith prologues. Miss Talia-
ferro is the accomplished star whose
fame is ever associated with “Polly
of the Circus” and “Rebecca of Sun-
nybrook Farm,” although she has
more recently toured in “Captain
“Kidd, Jr.,” ‘_‘Kissing Time” and
“Mother Carey’s Chickens.”

GRAND 

 

Can true love be purchased, or is
it a matter entirely of mutual under-
standing and sympathy? This is. one
of the questions brought up in Norma
Ta1madge’s latest First National pho-
todrama, “The Wonderful Thing,” de-
clared _to be the biggest production
she has ever made- and booked for
showing at the Million Dollar Grand,
Pittsburgh, all next week, starting
‘Monday morning, November 14. It
is a society drama, of the type in
which this world wide favorite made
her greatest success, and yet entirely
different, in story, characterizations
and situations from anything she has
appeared in previously. It is a photo-
play of heartbreak: and happiness,
suffering and joy, and intense dra-
matic interest from beginning to end.

“The Wonderful Thing” is a dis-
tinctive sort of picture, with a fas-
cinating blending of comedy and
drama. In the early portion of the
story Miss Talmadge is a madcap
American girl, just out of 3. convent
in France. Her role is that of Jac-
queline Boggs, the only daughte-r of
the American Hog King, and imbued
with the‘ American spirit of freedom,

she knows how to make the staid Eng- ,

lish, followers of tradition, sit up and
take notice when she visits in the
United Kingdom. She meets the
members of an impoverished English
family, the Mannerbys, and does not
know that -Donald Mannerby, when
he asked her to become his wife, is
really considering -the funds she will
bring into his family purse, more
than her own sweet self. In fact
she conceives the idea that it would
hurt Donald’s stern -aristocratic pride
to offer him money, and after their
marriage she never mentions the mat-
ter of ﬁnances to him. But it hap-
pens he is worried about a scrape in-
to which his weak brother has fallen,
and another complication enters when
he does actually begin to fall in love
with his wife. This brings engross-
ing developments, ﬁlled with grip-
ping interest, events that are deeply
human, and incidents that appeal to
the emotion-s. .

Miss Talmadge was never lovelier,
and she seems to be more histrioni-
cally superb than ever before. She
acts the lighter bits with cleverness
worthy of her comedievnne sister, Con-
stance, and in the serious moments
she is tremendous. Harrison Ford
is the handsome and very capable
leading man and others in the cast
include Julia Hoyt, a famous New
York society woman; Howard Truss-
dale, Robert Agnew, Ethel Manning,

"Mabel Burt, Fanny Burke, Walter

McEwan, and Charles Craig. The
story is adapted from the speaking
stage play by Lillian Bralley and was
directed by Herbert Brenon.

On the ‘bill in addition will be a
Christie comedy, “In For Life,” the
Grand News Weekly and “Topics of
the Day.” An excellent program of
music will be played by the symphony
orchestra; under’ the direction of David
Broudy. Both orchestra and pipe
organ will be all-day features. Per-
formances will be continuous from 10
a. in. until 11 p. m.

Musical clubs. that a phonograph rec-
ord had been completed and placed
in the club’s hands for sale. The rec-
ord was produced by the "Starr Phon-
ograph company of Richmond, Ind.
The songs were sung by the- Criterion
Male Quartette of New York City.
“Hail to Pitt,” and “Alma Mater” are
on opposite sides of the record.

The Musical clubs have been grant-
ed sole rights for the sale of the rec-
ords on the campus. They will also
realize a certain percentage of the
proceeds of each sale. Every student
and alumnus who buys a record will
also get two songs of the Alma Mater.
The records are to be sold by mem-
bers of the clubs who will try to
place one in the home of every stu-
dent and alumnus. The price of the
record will be one do-llar. The songs
were heard Wednesday and Thursday
nights by.§he clubs at their meetings.

A magnavox, sound amplifier will
be connected with a phonograph pla.y-
ing the records and will be stationed
on the steps of State Hall for the ben-
efit of the students.‘

The Starr Phonograph company
will also have two sound amplifiers
at the W. & J. football game, where
the records will be played and sold
by the Musical clubs between halves.

The club's announcement that they
had donated their services to the Red
Cross for their coming drive, was also
given out. The clubs will entertain
in any manner the Red Cross commit-

s

The picture of the combined clubs
was taken Wednesday morning, with
the largest number of men present in
the history of the club. Fifty-eight
men reported for the picture. Pre-
viously thirty-five was considered a
large number for the picture.

Individual pictures were also taken
of Manager Little and Russel Carl,
president of the clubs.

The position of leader of the Glee
club is still open due to the resigna-
tion of former leader Sisler last week.

C. E. Keagy has been named as
‘publicity manager for the combined
clubs for the coming season.

Rev. J, Cabot Clark. representing

 

I the Near East Relief, spoke on condi-
tions in the Near East before tlie

general student assembly in Soldiers’
Ilemorial Hall last Wednesday noon.
Rev. Clark said in substance:

After he had been in Soviet, Rus-
tin, and Turkey for a few days he

inc conditions dn those countries had
not been in the least exaggerated.
In Constantinople there are the
rei'nan'.n of Wrangels Soviet army
100.0100 in number, that are hoping to
see the destruction of Sovietism.
Conditions in Soviet Armenia and
Georgia are even more terrible than
in Turkey. Former members of royal
Russian families have fled into these
regions lrom Russia and are glad t.o
do the most menial labor. Rev. Clark
said he saw one former Russian
nirince who was acting as a coach-
ﬂan.-
These countries were already de-
vastated by famine and wars before
the Soviet took the reigns of power.
But Soviet rule has not relieved fam-
ine conditions. Sanitary conditions
are bad. In Alexandropol, Rev. Clark
law bodies hauled out every morning
to the trenches and the bodies thrown
thereinu All the result 01’. starvation.
Children with sunken cheeks, glazed
«eyes, hatchet-shaped faces were seen

then bloat and a death of most hor-
rible agony would ensue.

In the capital of the Arabian Re-
public, the Near East Relief has es-
tablished orphanage to provide cloth-
ing, food and shelter to the Arabian
children made homeless a.nd father-
less by the ravages of the Tu-rk.
These orphanages on first taking the
children give them a thorough; bath,
then provide food gradually increas-
ing the rations to normal. The or-
phanage teaches tlie children how to
live and how to smile. that they for-
,2;etthel".or1'il)le nightmares they have
experienced The Near East Relief
has established these orphanages, notg
tor commercial reasons or gain, but
to save human lives. Even at that,
there are two children outside the or-
plmnages that cannot be given ac-
commodation to every one within.
There are about 100,000 cared for by
the orphanages.

, Thus Rev. Clark brought his words
to a close and he emphasized that the
conditions in the Near East -'3-‘ertainly

, warranted our help. He said ti’.-at. the

Relief was not asking for money, but
for contributions in the form of cer-
tain non-perishable foodstuffs. He ap-
pealed to the students to give what‘
they could of things of that nature.

LAREE FACULTY liYM CLASS
INDICATED BY APPLICATIONS

An encouraging number of applica-
tions have been received to date for
the Faculty Gym class, in response
to notices sent out from Director Mill-
er-’s office last week. About twenty
or thirty have already signiﬁed their
intention of entering the class which
is to be instructed by Professor H. H.
Provin of the Department of Physi-
cal Education. ’

It has been decided to hold the class
from 9:80 to 11:30 on Friday morn-
ings, that time having been pre-
ferred by the big majority of the ap-

 

lplicants. The class would have start-

ed» this Friday, were it not for the
fact that it is a University holiday.
It will therefore not commence until
Friday week, November 18. Appli-
cations are still being received and
faculty members who have not yet
returned their cards may still do so.

of certain good results, though the
latter may seem somewhat intangi-
b-le. To the everydaycollege under-
graduate, llie seriousness of such 2
quesl;ion as armament limlitation.
forces him to relegate it to that
group: of subjects which he knows
he should be interested in, but
which he rather automatically steers
clear of. It is rather a characteristic
thing among ,Ame'rican college stu-
dents—~this manifest disinterest and
almost utter apathy regarding the
more profound issues of the da

It must have been thistenclency
which prompted President Hibben (
Princeton University to conceive
this idea of a conference for tl:
discussion of the disarmament ques

tion. Will; the date of the Wash-
ington Conference looming near

at hand. Mr. Hibben graspeld this op-
portunity of bringing this all-import
ant issue before the thought of each
undergraduate student in our 
em colleges. Again there might ‘be
a. pressure brought to bear 011
branches of public opinion other
than the student thought.

Before the conference took place
word went out from Princeton that

it. was not the purpose or hope of‘

the conference to. exercise any in-
ﬁuence at the larger conference in
Waslhington. The’ intention of thl:-2
meeting; at Princeton was to arouse
interest and stimulate discussior

The response and interest which
has been aroused is an excellent
thing. Why should the men who
will probably have to bear the brunt
of future wars remain quiet and think
disinteresiedly on this subject? It
is to be hoped that the considerate‘
thought of every Hopkins student
is given over to the possible settle-
ment of this menace. It is a very
adequate way .01 showing apprecia-

Wrigley Building

   

 

Wrigley’s new ofiice building in
Chicago is at the new Boulevard Link
Bridge, Michigan avenue and the river
and heads the vista looking north on
Michigan avenue, so ‘Mr. Wrigley chose
a beautiful design which makes the
building a decorative feature of the
Chicago lake front and harmonizes with
the Chicago Beautiful plan.

Wrigley Building
The main building is 16 stories high,
surmounted by a tower 42 feet square
and rising 393 feet from the street
level. This tower will contain a clock
with dials on four sides, each 20 feet in
diameter and will be surmounted by a
Searchlight lantern 9 feet in diameter.
The building is covered with enamel
ﬁnish terra cotta on all four sides. It
is regarded as one of the most beauti-
ful buildings in Chicago and people and
press are enthusiastic about it. The
Chicago Tribune published a picture
labeling it a “A Jewel of the Link.”
Wrigley also recently completed new
factories at Chicago and New York.

. All‘ this new construction work in
the space of a few y rrs is certainly a
tribute to the power of advertising and '
the accumulative effect of a multitude
of 5-cent sales.

, Practice Game Last Saturday

 

Everything is in readiness for the

_ annual clash with W. & J. here Sat-
.‘ , urday. To the winner of this game

will go the gridiron title of Western
' Pennsylvania.‘ The games between
the two institutions are always hum-
mers a d this year’s promises to be
no exc tion. . .

This year marks the twenty-second
engagement between the two schools.

- In eleven of the contests, the Presi-

dents have been victorious; in ten
Pitt is deter-
mined to square the match with this
year’s battle. Prior to 1915 the mat-
_ter of ’ victories was a see-saw affair
with W. & J. holding the advantage.
However since then the Panthers
have had a monopoly of victories.

‘ Pitt has six straight triumphs to its

- Overcoat new-

credit. In 1915 Pitt won 19-0; the
next year they won 37-0; in 1917 Pitt

had a 13-10 victory; in 1918 Pitt wal-

gloped the Presidents 34-0; 1919 they

wc'n 7-6; last year Pitt won 7-0.

V The Pres-idents -have a “whale” of
«a team and claim it to be their year
for" a reversal. They have a highly
experienced squad with many bril-
liant stars. Russ Stein, Herb’s broth-
er, is the captain of the team, a cap-
tain with few superiors. Like his
brother, Russ is one of the outstand-

when. he scored two touchdowns with-
in ﬁve minutes. This year he was
again the feature of the contest. His
work at Forbes Field last year is
still fresh in our memories.
McLaughlin at quarterback is con-
spicuous with his ability in aerial at-
tacks. With his demlon ﬂings he
keeps the game continually in doubt.
Basista, a Pittsburgh product has
played well at fullback for the Presi-
dents this year.’ Mitchell, West and
Brenkert have had a prominent place
in the victories this season. The
line is well balanced from end to end
and has shown particular aptitude in
stopping the opponent’s attack. Kopf
has a neat fashion of snatching the
ball from the air and in scooping up
fumbles. Marion on the other end,
also plays a prominent part. In the-
center of the line, Weiderquist, Vince,

that is well nigh impregnable. This,
together with a dependable string of
substitutes,_ is the team that has
played havoc with their opponents.

On the other hand the Panthers are
not so fortunate at the present time.
It is feared that injuries will lessen
Pi'tt’s chance with the Presidents Sat-
urday. The tolll-. of the last several
games has exacted considerable of

ing stars of -the season. He is a

‘ giant and a tower ‘of strength on the

attack and defense of the Washing-
tonians. Following closely behind
him is the whirlwind Swede, Erick-
son, and it will take some close
watching on the part of the Panthers
to prevent this ﬂa‘sh from getting
loose. ‘ Last year he sprang into
prominence in the Syra_cuse game

 

QUALITY is the one thing
that will win against all ac-
cidents of fortune—-—the best

Pitt’s strength. _
Little Washington is planning a
wholesale migration to Pittsburgh to
support the Presidents. They are
planning to come here to support a
winning team so well do they regard
their team’s chances before the Pan-
ther onslaught.

. There is really only one medium
of comparison between the two teams,
the Syracuse game. With its game
at its zenith, the Panthers marched
over the Orange 35-0. On the fol-
lowing Saturday, the Red and Black
defeated Orange 17-10. However the
scores are not indicative of the
abilities of the teams. The condi-
tions were entirely different. With
Pitt, Syracuse was boastful and over-
conﬁdent; with W. & J. they fought
with their backs to the wall. As, for

  A LITTLE DOP

ANOTHER DEFEAT

Again we are forced to bow down in defeat and again we take it like
sports. There are absolutely no alibis to be offered for Saturday's defeat.
We lost to 5 team that outplayed us in every department of the game. We
lost to one of the greatest’ teams that ever played on. Forbes Field. All that

that the Lafayette defeat, followed by ‘the close calls with West Virginia and
Cincinnati, had in putting the team on edge forpthe Syracuseand Penn
games, then W. &. J. and State better look out. And that is the thing we
must set out to accomplish this week. We must get behind ‘the team with

« our “Beat W. &. J.” slogans,and prepare for Saturday as though nothing

else mattered in the world.
THAT EASTERN CHAMPIONSHIP

The eastern championship lsagain a badly muddled affair, largely" a
result of the season's upsets- Last year Pitt, State, Prlnceton_and Harvard
were tied for supremacy in the east. ‘This year Pitt has been defeated twlce,
Harvard has lost twice and been tied once, Princeton has been beaten twice,
and ‘State has been tied. The chances are that none of these teams can
claim the championship of the east. Leadin undefeated teams in this
section of the country at present are State, ‘W. &. J'., Lafayette, Cornell, Yale
and’ the_Navy._ It is not often that‘-we stoop ‘to predictions, but we venture
that at the end of the season Cornell and Lafayette will be the only teams
with perfect records and_ of these two that Cornell will be generally recog-
nized as the champion, in view of Lafayette’s“‘comparatively easier schedule.
That prediction is based on several preliminary ones, namely, that State
knocks off the Navy this Saturday, that Pitt beats W. &. J., that Princeton
eliminates Yale from the running, that‘Yale conquers Harvard, that Penn in
walloped by Cornell, that Lehigh bows to Lafayette, that the Navy wins
from the Army, and ﬁnally that Pitt beats State. lf we'are right, give us
credit, if‘ we are wrong, rub it in.‘ We dz; not mean to relegate Pitt to the
ranks of the “Also Rans” at this date. We believe that by Thanksgiving we
will again be near the’ top of the list and that some may rank us ﬁrst on the
showing made aalnst Syracuse. and Penn and that we are going to make
against W. &‘ J. and State.- However, the two defeats have given us a
temporary set-back in eastern rankings and make it hard for anyone to con-
ceive of a team twice defeated as"-champions. ' '

SUPREMACY OF WESTERN FOOTBALL -
This is certainly the west's year on the gridiron. Every big intersec-
tlonal clash to date has been won by the west. First, Princeton is forced ’
to bow to Chicago in what was considered a big upset. After that battle it
is supposed that Chicago is the strongest team in the western conference.
when suddenly they are beaten by Ohio State,-rindlcating that there are
other teams in the west stronger than the Maroon. Therefore, if Princeton
is one of the best teams in the east and there are better teams in the west
than Chicago and Chicago is ‘considerably better than Princeton, what is
the only logical conclusion? Secondly, the Army, which never has a slouch
of a team,‘ is humiliated, 28-0, by‘ Notre Dame. Thirdly, on top of its form
against Syracuse and Penn, Pitt loses to the Cornhuskers who showed power
such as had not been seen at Forbes Field in a long time. Again the dope
points to the same thing——that western football is gaining the upper hand.
Personally we, even on the evidence of these three, games, are unwilling to
concede that western football is becoming -classier than eastrn, but will
concede that western football is becoming classler than eastern, but will
som kind friend help us out with an explanation for the west’s successes?
some kind friend help us out with an explanation for the west’s successes?

should be said is that if the defeat at the hands of Nebraska has the effect ~

Half Fatal to Panthers

For the second time since 1914 our
Panther football team lost a game at
Forbes Field when the University! ‘of
Nebraska eleven defeated them last
Saturday, 10-0. Some may say that
it was an upset of the dope,.fo‘r most
local football fans were fully conﬁ-
dent that Pitt would win by at least
two touchdowns. But anyone that
saw the game last Saturday was suf-
ﬁciently -convinced that Nebraska
could defeat almost any eleven in the
country and that Pitt, although beat-
en, was not disgraced. Nebraska's
only defeat this season was suffered
at the hands of Notre Dame, who,
many are inclined to say, is the best
team in the country.

We simply lost to a superior team.
They are the bulkiest and massiest
team in the West. However, they
combined their bulk and mass with
speed and brains, and the four worked
in perfect co-ordination. At no time,
it seemed, was there a combination
of less than the four.

Their line outcharged ours at all
times. The Westerners gained con-
sistently through our forwards. Our
backs, -on the other hand, merely
bounded back when they attempted to
force their way through the Scarlet
wall of the visitors.

In spite of the fact that their line
played better than 'o‘lxrs, they.’ were
unable to do any scoring through it.
Several times they marched almoss.
the entire length ‘of the ﬁeld, only to
be checked when they approached the
vicinity of our goal line.

It was only the quick thinking of
Nebraska's quarterback, Preston, that
enabled them to: score against us the
touchdown that gave them. the jump,
and in reality, the victory. Preston,
realizing that less‘ than a. minute re-
mained for the whistle to blow that
signiﬁed the end of the ﬁrsthalf,
called a forward pass signal. The

FRESHMEN _ANll    
lllslll Tll MEET E  
THIS SATURDAY

When the Pitt Freshman team lines
up against Kiski Saturday in the pre-
liminary to the Pitt-W. & J. game,
they will be contending with” their
most formidable opponents of the
season. This game will ring down
the curtain for the Kiski team and
they are sure to put up a great battle
in an, effort to win their ﬁnal contest
and so keep her record unstained.
The Saltsburg boys have been play-
ing a brand of football which stamps
them as having undoubtedly the best
prep school team in the east; she has
victories to date over W. & J. Re-
serves, West Virginia University
Freshmen, Carnegie Tech Reserves,
Slippery Rock Normal, Princeton
Freshmen and Cornell Freshmen;
has played a scoreless tie with the
Penn State Freshmen which team
was beaten Saturday by the Panther
Cubs.

Kiski’s line and backﬁeld is heavy,
clever and fast and may be depended
upon to give a good account of them-
selves every minute. Gray at center,
captain of the team, has made an en-
viable reputation for himself in prep
school circles due to his excellent
punting and great defensive playing.
Jones, drop kicker for his team and
playing left end, a cousin of our own
Tommy Davies, is deserving of much
credit for hisgability to diagnose and
break up plays of his opponents. The
tackles are speedy and the guards
present a veritable stone wall; the
ends are fast and clever. Taken as
a unit they are an aggressive and
well balanced combination.

The Panther Yearlings havebeen
hitting a great stride this season and
at present are riding on the crest of
the wave; undefeated in every start
is their record and they are deter-
mined not to allow Kiski, whose team
is laying claim to the ‘prep school
championship of the United States, to
win a victory over them. The Cubs
have a powerful charging machine,_an
impenetrable stone wall line. and a
wonderful backﬁeld, which combina-
. tion has spelled defeat for such teams
as Cornell Freshmen, 'lWest Virginia
_ Freshmen, Slippery Rock ‘Normal,
Penn State Freshmen and Syracuse
Freshmen, --the best reresentative
Freshmen teams in the east. Dope,
if it may be counted upon for any-
thing, favors Pitt, for Slippery Rock

.every stage of the game and would

The Pitt Freshmen. added another
victory to their season’s record, when
they defeated the Penn State Fresh-
ies at State College last Sa.turday by

the score of 14 to 6. The Pitt team
clearly outplayed their opponents at

have won by a much larger score had
it not been for a number ofpfumbles
in the second half. They should not
be censured too strongly for this how-
ever, as the severe cold with constant
snow ﬂurries made fumbles numerous.
By closely following the .‘ball and
playing their usual hard smashing
game the Freshies made most of their
opponents" fumble-s count to their ad-
advantage, without suffering any ser-
ious loss from their own misplays.
In the ﬁrst half the Pantherings
completely outplayed, outguessed, and
outgeneraled the Nittany Cubs, mak-
ing eight ﬁrst downs to their
two. However, they were unable to
score more than one touchdown be-
cause of the fact that whenever dan-|
ger threatened their goal line the
State Yearlings deve‘,;o‘ped an unex-
pected ﬁrmness of defense which
coupled with the occasional Pitt
errors brought them momentary re-
lief. . .

The second half, barring the open-
ing kick-‘off, was indeed one of weird
plays and combinations. It was im-
possible to tell one moment what was
going to happen the next. Due to

Pitt 26 to 6; Kilski played
Penn ‘State Freshmen a. score-.
less tie, Pitt beat State
14 to 6. Nevertheless, it is quite evi-

dent that this game will be one worth
whilewatching for both teams are
quite evenly matched and out for a
victory, full of ﬁght and aggressive.
It is quite possible that some future
Pitt star may be: seen in action ‘here,
when we recall the number of Kiski
men now playing on our’ Varsity squad.
“Pie” Williams, Ewing, Davies, Hol-
leran and Stein.

.The Kiski team will probably line
up as follows: Ends, Jones and Vas-
sia; tackles, Prendergrast and Magee;
guards, Bauchman and Fenton; cen-
ter, Captain Gray; quarterback, West;
halfbacks, Wilds and Millman, and
fullback, Amos. '

The ==Fre_,sl1men will present the fol-
lowing team: Ends, Gwosden and
Frank; t'ack1'e_s, Murdoch and Akins;
guards, Captainll-Iangartner and Car-
nahan; center, Ashbaugh; quarter-
back, Flanagan; halfbacks, Bruder
and Bohren, and fullback, Johnson.
