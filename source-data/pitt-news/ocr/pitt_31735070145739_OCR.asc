Students read
for ‘stardom’

3 Pitt students vie for Campus Superstar title.

Olivia Garber
For The Pitt News

Three Pitt freshmen made it to the ~

ﬁnal round of the Campus Super-
star competition, and they have the
chance to steal the spotlight. from
Carnegie Mellon, which swept the
podium last year.

Campus Superstar is a solo-
singing competition involving
area colleges. The competition
began with 156 hopeful singers,
but a panel of judges has narrowed
that number to the ﬁnal 10. The
event will be hosted by Hillel jew-
ish University Center of Pittsburgh
on Sundaygat 7 p.m.'

The ﬁnalists will sing in Sun-
day’s event, which the Hillel web-
site calls “a spectacular, profes-
sionally produced show, where
performers are accompanied by a
full band, with all of the ‘glitz’ that
one would expect from a concert,
Broadway show or  American
Idol.” The winning performer will
receive a cash prize of $5,000, and

» two runners—up will receive $1,000.
Pitt students Tyler Kirkland, Ra-
chel Labosky and Laci Mosley are

"three contendersto become the
next Campus Superstar.

Tyler Kirkland

Tyler Kirkland, a freshman ac-
tuarial mathematics major, wowed
judges with a gospel rendition that
earned him a spot in the ﬁnal 10.

Kirkland, who decided against
majoring in music because there
“was not enough ﬁnancial secu-
rity,” has been singing in front of
audiences since childhood.

“I sang in the church choir ,

pretty much all my life,” Kirkland
said.»

A strong musical background
helped Kirkland in the ﬁrst round
of auditions for Campus Superstar.
Kirkland, who learned about the
event by ﬂiers and advertisements
in the mail, made the ﬁrst cut de-
spite being slightly sick and run-
ning late to work. ‘

l “I was thinking, will I be able
to do this? I have to go to work,”
he said.

Kirkland was able to do it, and '

received an e—mail congratulating
him for making it to the semiﬁnals
during Christmas break.

Before auditioning for Campus
Superstar, Kirkland was active in
the music scene at Lincoln Park
Performing Arts Charter School.

_ While there, Kirkland participated

in shows and musicals, a scholastic
career which included earning a
memorable role of Hugh Pickering
in “My Fair Lady.”

Now Kirkland lends his vocals
to the Pitt Men’s Glee Club. If he
wins the $5,000 prize, Kirkland
hopes-to use the money to fund a

~ summer trip to Europe with the

glee club.

Kirkland enjoys singing locally,
but he doesn’t plan on trying out
for national competitions. He said

Pitt’s Study Abroad Oﬁice identiﬁed a
group of study abroad programs last
month that are not directly rtm by the
University but will be recognized as
partner programs.

The list of Pitt-recognized institu-
tions includes the American Univer-
sity in Cairo, the London School of
Economics, Konan University (for the
Year Injapan Program) and Comenius

Universityinslovakia. Four schoolswill
be recognized inlsrael and two eachin
Germany and Poland.

Between this past December and
February, Pitfs Council ofDeans, which
sets academic policy, reviewedvarious
third—party provider programs based
on their academic merits. Those that
passed made the list ofPitt—recognized
institutions and providers. Some pro-
grams, such as Semester at Sea, will
no longer be recognized program
providers. The updated list includes
programs through Arcadia Universi-

ty, Academic Programs International
and the American Institutef'orForeign
Study, according to the Study Abroad
Office website.

The policy that began this initia-
tive was passed in the spring of 2007
and clariﬁed in a subsequent memo in
early 2008 as part of an larger effort
to bring more control of study abroad
programs to Pitt. ‘

LarryFeick, seniordirectoroflnte -
national Programs, offeredanexample
ofhow this could apply to students in-
terested in studying abroad.

A student might want to study
through the University of Wisconsin
because a certain class isn’t offered
through Pitt, Feick said.

“Recognized programs are pre-
screened, where students don’t have
to go through as much of a hassle as
theywouldingettingaregulardomestic
transfer credit,” he said.

Feick said this change is a way to
startbuildingasetofprovisionally rec-
ognized programs at Pitt.

“Once the approved process is in
place, any non—Pittprogramswillhave

C Pitt extends control over study abroad programs

to go through academic reviews to be

allow students to maintain registra-
tion at Pitt and use the University to
process federal or state ﬁnancial aid on
the program. However, Pitt scholarship
ﬁindingwill notbe eligible forit.A_study
abroad contract mustbe completed to
participate.

“The recognized list is essentially

SGB proposal addresses budget requests

Carla Trinca-Conley
Staﬂ’ Writer

Student Government Board member
Phil LaRue introduced a new resolu-
tion last night allowing some of Pitt’s
largest and most inﬂuential student
groups to submit supplemental bud-
get requests throughout the year.

The groups — Asian Student
Alliance, Black Action Society, Engi-
neering Student Council, Interfrater-
nity Council, National Pan-Hellenic
Council, Nursing Student Associa-
tion, Panhellenic Council, Resident
Student Association and SGB -— can
only submit annual budget requests
at this time.

Charlie Shull, Board president,
said, “It makes it diﬂicult for them to
be abletoplan every program speciﬁ-
cally for the year.”

The annual budgets, which goups
must determine early in the school
year, include the entire money supply
used forlectures and events hosted by
the group for the school year.

Three groups wanted to change
something they had previously re-
quested for in the budget this year,
he said.

However, because they are Student
Affiliated Affairs Groups, they are un-
able to requestapreviously approved
or denied line item, Shull said.

With the passing of the new reso-
lution, the Board will then be able
to hear for line items — part of the
group’s annual budgets -— that were
previously reviewed, Shull said.

Voting of the resolution was post-
poned to allow for the public and
Board members’ review.

The resolution will be submitted
online for the public to view. Shull said
the resolution online would serve as
one more venue for people to look
at, making it more convenient for
them.

The Board meetingwas lightly at-
tended but did hear from Emma Oti,
a freshman at Pitt.

Oti addressed the Board about her
concern for the lack of housing and
“viable options” offered to freshmen
and sophomores—to—be.

Oti said, “It’s been very difficult
ﬁnding housing, and the options that
are available have been out of people’s
price ranges.”

“It’s not only an issue of where
[students are] going to live, but can
I afford to live in the options that are

presented to me,” Oti said, “and if not,
what then am I left with?”

She asked for the Board to inﬂu-
ence the administration to help ﬁx
the problem.

_ “Housing has continuously been
the number one issue for studen ,”

' Shullsaid,“butit’s usuallyofilcampus '

housingasfaraswhatwe hear in'Stu-
dent Government Boar .”

Shull said he will research into
the problem and talk with Panther
Central.

Last night’s meetingwas the short-
est ofthe 2010 schoolyearbecause the
Board is in moratorium.

Allocations is not taking any re-
quests until Monday.

Shull said Board proposals are due

A Friday at5 p.m. Each Board memb_er’s

proposal represents a cohesive project
of the research conducted andworked
on for over a year.

Shull hopes the documentswillbe
readyfor-submission to the appropri-
ate administrators.

al for their credits,” Feick said. ”
These programs differ from Pan-

ther Programs, which have been de- ‘

veloped by Pitt faculty from various
departments. The program developer
travels with the students and teaches
one or more classes in the program
abroad. .

AllPanther Programs offer classes

directly affect the student’s GPA.

Feick said thatPittistryingto create
more Panther Programs because “the
Universitywantstohave abetter handle
on the academic quality of a student’s
experience abroad.” ,

“With programs that we create
ourselves, we can control the choice
of faculty andtrustthe syllabus,” Feick
said. i .

He said whereas some universities
only offer their own programs, Pitt
doesn’t have a large enough under-
graduate population-to operate that
way. .

Studentswho studyabroadthrough
any other non-Pitt program do not
maintain registration at the school
during the semester they are abroad.

The amount of information available for human use doubles every three years.

Laci Mosley

Pitt freshman Laci Mosley is
one of the top—10 solo singers of
local universities, but she’s a re-
luctant “superstar.”

“I actually don’t like singing
that much at all,” Mosley said.

Mosley, a theater and business
major, said acting is her main pas-
sion. Although she prefers acting,
Mosley works on what she calls a
“triple threat” —— a combination of
acting, singing and dancing — to
become a better performer.

“In acting I don’t have a prob-
lem making a fool out of myself.
Singing makes you feel vulnerable.
I push myself to do more singing
competitions,” Mosley said.

From bubbles to R&B, student sings spectrum

Superstar < 1

Although Mosley said she didn’t
expect to make it this far, singing
has been a part of her life since
childhood.

Mosley remembers singing a
song about bubbles during church
when she was 5. Despite another
child having the microphone, Mos-
ley said she took the microphone
away from the child in order to
sing.

Now, instead of songs about
bubbles, Mosley sings with amore
R&B style.

Mosley is not a stranger to
performing competitions. In
her hometown of Terrell, Texas,
Mosley participated in many local
competitions, and even won a few
talent shows.

Mosley said that Campus Su-
perstar is the biggest competition
she’s participated in.

If she wins, Mosley hopes to
use the money to help pay for next
year’s attendance at Oxford Uni-
versity, although she admits she

would like to splurge a little on herself.
“I want to use a little to buy shoes. I have
an addiction, you could say,” Mosley said.

Rachel Labosky

Rachel ‘Labosky is grateful for her friends.
If it were not for their encouragement, La-
bosky would not have tried out for Campus
Superstar —— or made it to the top 10.

The Pitt freshman saw the ﬂiers around
campus, but said she didn’t consider audi-
tioning until her friends pushed her.

i “I’m really g1ad—that my friends encour-
aged me to try out for it. I’m lucky to have
made it this far,” Labosky said.

J While Labosky is a communications ma-
jor, she would “love to make [music] a pro-
fessional career.”

Labosky’s interest in music began in sixth
grade, when she started taking vocal lessons.
Labosky has since sung in churches, chil-
dren community theaters and high school
choruses.

During her high school career, Labosky g

played the role of Fanny Brice in a production
of the musical “Funny Girl,” as well as singing
the national anthem for the state football
championship at Hersheypark Stadium.

Even though Labosky competed in district
and regional musical competitions in high
school, she was still nervous for Campus
Superstar. Whereas she had experience sing-
ing in front of a crowd, Labosky said there
is a difference between singing the national
anthem and a song of one’s choice.

“The national anthem has a guideline of
how you have to sing. I get to express my-
self by choosing what song I’m singing,” La-

A bosky said. “The kind of music I’m geared

towards is Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson and
Alicia Keys.” _

Labosky said.getting to sing a song of her
choice made her “become more comfort-
able,” but this was still her ﬁrst time audi-
tioning for Campus Superstar.

“I didn’t know what to expect. I was kind
of nervous,” Labosky said.

Despite the nerves, Labosky’s rendition
ofjennifer Hudson’s “Love You I Do,” helped
her win a spot in the ﬁnal 10. I

Although Labosky could only be one per-
formance away from a $5,000 prize, she
hasn’t given much thought to winning. I

“My parents encourage me to use a lot of
it towards school, but I’d also like to splurge
it on something special,” Labosky said.

The cash prize is a perk of winning, but the
money isn’t Labosky’s main concern.

“I just want it to be something I’m going to
remember for a long time,” Labosky said.

THE GILES FILES

Don’t forget to have an open mind when you arrive at college’s perriiciously altruistic atmosphere.

 
   

Giles Howard

For many, college is the time to
venture out on their own ideo-
logically, discarding the beliefs
of family and friends in favor of
new ideas that they either stumble
upon or are exposed to in this new
setting. Indeed, the way in which
the college experience severs the
social and geographical bonds that
tie young people to the commu-

nity of their adolescence creates a,

vacuum of inﬂuences where fresh
ideas ﬂourish and a new morality
often develops.

Importantly, this campus-
centered morality is founded on

Columnist

an appearance of independent
thinking, but it often involves the
uncritical adoption of another
person’s needs as the driving force
for morality. This is evident in the
international humanitarian who
organizes students to stop hun-
ger in Africa, in the new socialist
who self-consciously sloughs off
his middle ‘class background to de-
cry the excesses of capitalistsand
starts a group working to unionize
service employees —— and, most of
all, it’s obvious in the student who,
in 2008, worked tirelessly to elect

(Barack Obama because he felt that

health care was a right.

What all these archetypes of col-
lege life have in common is that
they involve the college student’s
acceptance of another person’s

needs or values as more impor-
tant than the individual’s own. Ayn
Rand called such people “second

it in the only way it could be accept-
ed. By seeking self—esteem through
others. By living second-hand.”

Rather than accept the Leﬁ’s second-hand ideal of
altruism and self-sacriﬁce, students should fully

pursue that ﬁrst impulse.

centuries of being pounded with
the doctrine that altruism is the

Indeed, the dominant campus
Left that so many politically ac-
tive students identify with is a po-
litical movement whose morality
is “second-hand,” whose ideology

is deﬁned by altruism and whose
adherents —- though claiming to
think for themselves — just un-
critically adopt this other—focused
way of thinking.

Dr. Allan Gotthelf, avisiting pro-
fessor in Pitt’s Department of His-
tory and Philosophy of Science and
an expert on Rand’s philosophy of
objectivism, explained the relevant
part of Rand’s View of morality in
two principles: First, “Each person
has a right to pursue his own ratio-
nal self-interest,” and second, “We
will beneﬁt from [others] pursuing
their own self—interest, just as they
will [beneﬁt] from our pursuing
ours,” Gotthelf said.

These pillars of objectivism con-
stitute the morality of that segment
of the political Right that values

Howard -1 7

individual responsibility, free markets and
small government. It is this morality that is
largely absent from college campuses today
whereas the Leftist morality of altruism per-
vades higher education.

Part of the reason for this, Gotthelf said,
is that the ﬁrst-mentioned principle of ob-
jectivist morality isn’t defended or advanced
in American society. Instead, Gotthelf said,
“people are imbued with the moral sense that
lies behind socialism” in their places of wor-
ship, schools and families throughout their
lives, and although they are “too American”
to accept the political dimensions of social-

ism, they buy in to its morality. *

This acceptance of altruism constitutes
a perversion of that ﬁrst liberating impulse
that many students encounter when they
arrive at college: the new responsibility over
one’s own thoughts and actions. Rather than
accept the Left’s second-hand ideal of altru-
ism and self-sacriﬁce, students should fully
pursue that ﬁrst impulse.

Of course I realize that, as Gotthelf said,
“it’s not easy to be ﬁrst-hand.” The groups
dedicated to saving Darfur, unionizing uni-
versity employees or volunteering on alter-
native spring breaks all tug at the emotional

heartstrings of college students and conform
nicely to the socialist ethic of altruism that
pervades our society. Indeed, scofﬁng at
these groups and their goals seems callous
on a campus where we are told regularly
that we are privileged and should give back
to those less fortunate.

Students who already reject the second-
handedness of Leftist altruism must over-
come this pressure and begin to defend this
ﬁrst principle of objectivism if the ideological
makeup of college campuses is ever going
to change.

It’s no longer enough to oppose the spe-

ciﬁc political initiatives of the Left because
its embrace of altruism as morality makes it
far stronger -— on campuses and around the
country —— than the Right will ever be until
it acknowledges and advances the morality
of its cause.

We must make the case on campus that
the rational pursuit of self—interest is a moral
action and that the best way to live is to live a
life for oneself rather than a life for others.

The man who would later be-
come a master of the mix never re-
ally saw himself hurtling toward the
life of a disc jockey, let alone that of
a serious musician.

But “it just happened,” said

, Ramble Jon Krohn, better known

as RJD2. “I had a friend who played

guitar, and that got me interested V

in learning guitar. Later, I started
playing percussion.” '

RJD2 really made his foray into
the music scene when he tried
his hand at Djing with one of his
friends.

“He was selling his turntables
and a bunch of records, and I
bought it. Really, I bought it so I’
could get the records,” he said. “I
never aspired to be a D], but I just
had these turntables lying around
my house.”

« Soon, an interest in Djing led to
an interest in producing.

In his early days, RJD2 predomi-
nantly used a sampler in creating
most of his music. A sampler is a
very commonly used device that
allows an artist to mix and match
various bits of music. The resulting

» collage of sounds can then be ma-

nipulated in different ways and then
ultimately combined into a single,
cohesive piece. A

”It’s really an indispensable tool
in hip—hop and dance music today,”
RJD2 said. .

Humble beginnings soon gave
way. Before long, this virtuoso
amassed a larger- collection of in-

struments that he began. incorpo— -

rating into his established style to
produce an even more unique and
diverse sound.

“I’d say my music is somewhere A-

between electronic, hip—hop, ‘soul
and rock music  but in every song,
I’m not trying to cram in every style I
can or anything like that,” he said.
“Different songs come out differ-

ent ways,” he said. “Each song is an .-
odyssey into its own style.”

In the 10 years hehas made
music, R_]D2’s sound evolved from

“pretty much all sample-based”
music to an eclectic and original
combination of his signature mixes
and his own instrumentals.

“Sometimes what I do is really
traditional — writing chords, writ-
ing lyrics. Sometimes it’s coming

from other songs. It really varies,” —

he said.

V RJD2 often draws his inspiration l
C from soul music, “because it’s so

true to form,” he said. He cites Jimi

Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and particu-

larly Stevie Wonder as inﬂuences.
“All of the great rap music from

the late ’80s and into the ’90s, like V

Run DMC,” also had an effect on his
music, in addition to the funk music
of the ’60s and ’7os.

Consistent with his seemingly
laid—back personality, RJD2’s expec-
tations for the experience of his lis-
teners are relaxed. , ,

‘‘It’s not my place to put out any
limitations or hope that people take

my music in any particular way,” ‘

he said. “I don’t have any speciﬁc
desires other than for people to
enjoy my music. If people can ﬁnd

music that they really enjoy, they

are lucky.”

Cutrone’s tough advice hits deep for Stahl

Sam discovers the self— help section at the bookstore, and realizes when combined with fashion, it’s actually helpful.

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

It’s not often that I’ll admit to
liking anyone who’s had any-
thing to do with “The Hills.”
Nor is it a frequent occurrence
that I reference a former meth
addict as a role model. But I’ll
make an exception for all of the
above for fashion PR maven Kelly
Cutrone. S

After all, this is someone who
once said of Lauren Conrad, “She
didn’t really have the sense of

how to do things. She wanted
stuff to fall on top of her and into
her lap. I don’t know how she’ll
do [in the fashion industry.]”

Well, thank God someone who
counts said it out loud.

Kelly Cutrone is the founder of
People’s Revolution, a PR ﬁrm re-
sponsible for landing clients like
Vivienne Westwood and Long-
champ on the pages of Vogue.
To fashion insiders, Cutrone has
been a legend for a long time.
She came to mass fame, however,
when she appeared on “The Hills”

as Whitney Port and Lauren Con-
rad’s cutthroat boss. These days,
she has a reality show of her very

own —— a Bravo series titled “Kell

on Earth” —- and a new book.
I ﬁgured this was something I
needed to read.

So I took atrip to Borders

when I was home for spring

break. I scanned the “New Hard-

backs” section but couldn’t seem

to ﬁnd what I was looking for.

I went to the customer service

desk. “Excuse me,” I said, “Could

you help me ﬁnd Kelly Cutrone’s

new book?” I spelled out her

name and tried-‘ to recall the ex-,
act wording of the title.

“Ah yes,” the Borders employ-
ee said, “‘If You Have to Cry Go
Outside.’ Well, that’s an interest-
ing title. Yes, yes we have it. It’s

No ‘Chance’ for Taxi

AM T axi’s latest album a mediocre letdown

Staff Writer

AM Taxi

We .Don’t Stand A Chance _
Virgin Records

Sounds Like: Ballyhoo!
Grade: C

AM Taxi does not stand out from the
crowd, and the album title We Don’t Stand
A Chance might be more foreboding than
it intended. . L

The lead singer has an average voice,
with vocals that aren’t outstanding — but
not quite awful, either.

The band’s sound is eclectic, playing
smoothly one minute and “rocking” with
a rough—and-tough beat the next. Yet
even this isn’t done well enough to earn
an above-average approval.

with what one has to assume is an attempt
at changing emotion within the song. This
only manages to sound repetitive in chord
choice, essentially creating an album of
thegsame song repeating over  and over
 and over.

Once in a while there are a few bars
moved about in an attempt to create a
new tune, but it’s not enough change to
make that same old song into a brand new
song.

Worst of all are the mediocre lyrics.
AM Taxi hardly lives up to its rock genre
with songs like “Mistake” lamenting, “I
will be the razor, baby/I will be the pill/I
am the ambulance that never comes/The
antidote you spill.” Really? That’s all you
could come up with?

It’s time to dub this band AM “Aver-
age Music” Taxi. They have not created
anything awe-inspiring or moving —— at,
least not this time around.

Fashion industry no cakewalk

Fashion < 9

“Are you serious? I thought it was a
memoir,” I muttered half under my breath
and half loud enough for. the guy to hear
so he didn’t think I’m the kind of girl who
reads self—help books. Mortified, my eyes
nervously darted around the store mak-
ing sure no one I knew in high school
was watching me get assistance locating
a self—help book. I stiﬂed the urge to pull
a Charlotte York in that episode of “Sex
and the City” on which she tried to ﬁnd
a copy of “Starting Over Yet Again.” She
chickened out when she saw the collection

of weepingbasket cases in the se1f—help

aisle and instead said aloud, “Travel? Is
this the travel section?” and ran home to
order the book on Amazon.

No, I am not a middle—aged, teary—eyed

soon—to—be—graduated senior in need of
some life guidance. I read Cutrone’s “If You
Have to Cry Go Outside: And Other Things
Your Mother Never Told You,” (named
after her token advice for employees)
cover-to-cover in nearly one sitting. And
you know what? It turns out I am the kind
of girl who likes self—help books. Cutrone
details her life of partying, divorce, spiri-
tual rebirth, addiction and pregnancy out

of wedlock. This woman has done and
seen it all.

In an age when fashion has been glori-
fied as an industry full of free samples and
celebrity shoulder rubs, Kelly Cutrone has
swooped in to show that fashion is not a
cakewalk. Not even a carb-free cakewalk.
It’s gritty, mean and takes a whole lot of
hard work.

“Fashion,” the way most people see it,
is different from the way industry insid-
ers see it. Listing “Fashion” as an interest
on Facebook — particularly when listed
before or after “working out,” “hanging
with my besties” or “Living. Laughing.
Loving.” — does not mean you’re going
to be Vogue’s next contributing editor.
Being able to turn heads with a denim mini
skirt and tube socks (think Holly Madison)
does not mean you’re going to be Nylon
magazine’s next “It Girl.”

While the fashion industryis a less pen-
etrable social circle than “The Plastics,”
their standards are a little different than
Regina and the gals’. Gretchen Wieners
might demand pink on Wednesdays, but
the fashion world demands originality
and ruthless determination. The industry
is competitive, and not manylpeople are
willing to offer tips about how to break

. in. So it’s refreshing to watch and read

Cutrone’s words of wisdom.
At ﬁrst glance, girls who are looking
for a step—by-step guide for how to make

it to their magazine dream jobmay be -

disappointed that there aren’t explicit
instructions in Cutrone’s book. What she
does offer is a suggestion for some soul
searching and tough love. “I believe that

the universe constantly rearranges itself
to support your idea of reality. If you’re
always thinking, ‘Life sucks, and I suck,’
you’re deﬁnitely going to see a lot of dismal
sh*t out there,” she says in the book.

As for the people who just want to know
how to get a job at People’s Revolution, Cu-
trone says this: “Your pitch letter should
be something more than, ‘I love fashion,
please help melmanifest my dream.’ Do
not use rhyming words on your resume,
as in, ‘My passion is for fashion.’

This works only if you’re applying to
work for the estate of Dr. Seuss, Nickel-
odeon or the Scholastic Company.” And
that is why Kelly Cutrone is my favorite
b*tch in fashion. ‘

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt offense limps int ourname

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Wri ter

Under Jamie Dixon’s reign, the Pitt
men’s basketball team has become
deﬁned by its hard—nosed, gritty de-
fense.

Ranked ﬁrst for points in the Big
East, Pitt has contained the offense of
conference teams like Syracuse, Vil-
lanova, Westvirginia and Connecticut
all season. On average, the Panthers
have allowed a mere 61.4 opponent
points per contest.

, A good team, however, has a
healthy balance of both dependable
defense and explosive offense. While
ﬁnding success in half-court sets is es-
sential, being able to play up—tempo
“rim-and-gtm” offense is equally im-
perative.

Lately the Panthers have struggled
to put points on the board. The prob-
lem started early last month, when
theteamsuffered through aﬁve—game
streak when they averaged only 60
points per game.

Suspicions of offensive troubles
were conﬁrmed in the team’s recent
showing at Madison Square Garden
atthe BigEasttournament, where Pitt
struggled for each and every one of
its 45 points in a 50-45 loss to Notre
Dame.

“Takingaquality shot each and ev-
erytimewehavetheballis important,”
Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs said. “Ithink
shot selection was a big problem for

us, and it was one of the main things
where we couldn’t get overthat hump,
and couldn’t take the lead. We can’t let
that happen again.”

In the NCAAToumament, theteam
willdepend on Gibbs, who scored only
four points inthe Notre Dame game, to
create his own shot off screens. Dur-
ingthe regular season, the sophomore
guard led Pitt scoring 15.8 points per
game.

Chances are that Gibbs, who shoots
40 percentfrom the ﬁeld, won’trnake
every shot he takes, though. And in
that case the Panthers need to get sec-
ond chances.

Gary McGhee, Nasir Robinson,
Brad Wanamaker and Dante Taylorall
average at least one offensive rebound
per game, with McGhee and Robinson
pulling down atleasttwo per game. As
a team, the Panthers average 12.4 re-
bounds per game, placing them ninth
in the 16-team conference. The more
offensive rebounds Pitt gets not only
keeps the ball on its end of the ﬂoor,
butcanalso open up the perimeterfor
guards like Gibbs andjermaine Dixon
for uncontested shots.

The rigors of the NCAA Tourna-
ment will also demand consistent
contributions from Pitt’s backcourt, es-
pecially Dixon, the leader on the ﬂoor.
This includes waiting to get more pa-
tient shots from the half'—court sets.

In the frontcourt, McGhee and
Taylor shoot 60 percent. Gibbs shoots
40 percent from beyond the arc, with
Wanamaker closing in at 34 percent

from the ﬁeld. Workingthe ball inside
and out, and having patience, could
help the team come up withbetter shot
selection.

To avoidarough patch inthe Tour-
nament, Gibbs said that offense and
defense must be in sync.

“Getting the most out of every
possessionis something [head] coach
[Jamie] Dixonhas been stressing,” he
said. “We’ll need to execute on the de-
fensive end and get stops and rebound.
Ifwe do that, offense comesalot easier
and we ﬂow a lot better.”

Carrying his experience from last
year with him, Gibbs remarked thatthe
NCAA Tournamentis a special part of
his college basketball experience.

“This only comes acouple oftimes
in your lifetime. You’ve got to cherish
it. It was a great experience getting to
the Elite Eight, and now we want to
get even further. We’re going to start
one game and keep it moving,” Gibbs
said.

McGhee, who also traveled to the
Elite Eightwith theteamlastyear, ﬁg-

Adams, Pittbounce back against Spartans

After losing 7-0 to Syracuse, the Panthers dominated Norfolk State  last week, led by junior Elizabeth'Adams.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Heading into this past weekend,
junior Elizabeth Adams had lost
three consecutive singles matches
for the ﬁrst time in her Pitt tennis
career.

Now, she appears back on track

after beating Norfolk State’s Jen-
nifer Astbury in their No. 1 singles
match 6-0, 6-0 as the Panthers
(4-2, 1-2 Big East) dominated the
Spartans last week with a 7-0 vic-
tory.

“[The win] helped me regain
some conﬁdence. I was 2-3 and
not off to a good start this season,
but I didn’t feel any more pressure

to win,” Adams said, adding that
she couldn’t recall another period
in her career when she lost three
straight matches.

Adams, who last year became

the ﬁrst Pitt tennis player iirséhoola

history selected to the all-Big East
team, had only lost consecutively
once since joining the Panthers.
Two years ago,j. as a freshman,

she lost singles matches against
University of California, Riverside
and San Diego before beating Emily
Thayer of Youngstown State 6-2,
6-2.

“She was able to be aggres-
sive and attack,” Pitt Head Coach
George Dieffenbach said of Adams’
performance against Norfolk State.
“She was on top of her game.”

The win against Norfolk State
comes after a poor showing against
Syracuse, when the Pantherslost
7-0. The loss snapped Pitt’s three-
game winning streak.

“Syracuse was a much stron-
ger team. Norfolk State was a good
team, but not as good as Syracuse,”
Dieffenbach said. “That was a tie§rn

effort. Everybody played well. It

WNIT berth gives Panthers five consecutive trips to postseason

Q’ Adam Littman

Assistant Sports Editor

For the ﬁfth straight season, and only the eighth
time in school history, the Pittwomen’s basketball
mm is heading to the postseason.

While the Panthers (16-13, 5-11 BigEast) trailed
off once conference play started, dropping their
ﬁrst ﬁve Big East games, they will compete in the
Women’s National Invitation Tournament. Pitt
plays Toledo (24-8, 12-4 Mid—American Confer-
ence) Friday at7 p.m. in the ﬁrst round.

“We’re just really excited we’re in a tourna-
ment,” Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said in
a press release. ‘‘It’s our ﬁfth straight postseason
appearance and a new challenge for us, another
opportunity to compete and play in the WNIT‘.
Were really excited for the opportunity.”
as» Pitt last played in the WNIT in the 2005-06
season, and won its ﬁrst three games. The Pan-
thers beat Delaware 64-57, Mississippi 85-76 and
Virginia 68-58. The Panthers thenlostinthe semi-
ﬁnals to Marquette 77-64.

The following year Pitt made its ﬁrst NCAA
Tournament appearance, itsﬁrstofthree straight
appearances with the Panthers mal<ingthe Sweet
16 the previous two years.

The PantherswilltraveltoToled_o forthe game,
where the Rockets are 12-1 this season. The Pan-
thers, however, are just 6-8 on the road this year

and have lost three of their last four away games.

Toledo boasts three players who average in
double ﬁgures with Tanika Mays (14.8 points a
game), Naarna Shaﬁr (13.8 points per game) and
MelissaGoodall (10.1 points per game). Mays isTo—
led0’s leading rebounder, pulling down7.2boards
a contest, and Shaﬁr leads the Rockets averaging
6.8 assists per game.

“I know Toledo is a really goodteamfrom the
MAC,” Berenato said in the same release. “It’s al-
ways greatto playteamsfrom other conferences,
and I’m looking forward to going to Toledo this
week. They’re well coached, a very good point
guard and some girls that can score, so it will be
a challenge. But we are excited to have the op-
portunityto play.”

The Panthers also havethree players averaging
double digit points injania Sims (13 points per
game), Taneisha Harrison (12.7 points per game)
and Shaylascott (10.4points per game). Sims leads
Pitt by averaging 3.8 assists a game, and Chelsea
Cole ﬁnished ﬁrst in the Big East in rebounding,
averaging 11.3 boards a game.

The winner of the game plays the winner of
the Kent State and Michigan game. The date and
location of that game will be announced once the
ﬁrst round is completed Ifthe Panthers want to
get to the semiﬁnals, or even further, this year, it
will take abit more effort. For the ﬁrsttime in its
13-year history, theWNI'I‘has 64teams, expanded

was a complete team match.”

One reason Dieffenbach got credited for
the win against Norfolk was that the Panthers
were able to practice outside on consecutive
days for the ﬁrst time since the fall.

“We got down there a little early and were
able to go outside and get used to wind and
sun,” Adams said.

Pitt’s ﬁnal doubles pair was Sabrina Vis-
ram and Gabrielle Catanzariti. In the No. 2
doubles match they beat Rebecca Graft‘ and
Chenge Tsapayi 8-2. In the No. 4 singles
match, Catanzariti beat Tsapayi 6-2, 6-3.
Visram beat Graff6-2, 6-2 in the No. 5 singles

This will be a good chance-for us to try and build

Along with her singles win, Adams also

The Panthers are back on the courts today

State. After that, Pitt hosts Duquesne March

the Big East action.

“Youngstown State will probably be a bet-

to continue to be aggressive and attacking on
offense. This will be a good chance for us to
try and build up some momentum heading
