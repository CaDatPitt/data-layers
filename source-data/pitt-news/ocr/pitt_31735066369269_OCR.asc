Viel-Cambodian Dispute

Result of l||-Feelings

By FRANK PHILLIPS

In January the Vietnamese swept through Cambodia in less than two
weeks and overthrew the regime of Premier Pol Pot. What is unclear to
many is why the Vietnamese would invade the small weak nation of

Cambodia. '

Dr. Joseph Zasloff, professor of political science at Pitt and a former
teacher at the University of Saigon, recently gave his explanation for
the Vietnamese attack in an interview.

News Analysis

According to Zasloff, the traditional hatred and mistrust between the
people is one reason for the dispute. This hatred stems-from historical

disputes over territory.

In more recent years the Cambodians under Pot have been involved
in many border disputes and small skirmishes with the Vietnamese.
Pot claims that the Vietnamese have been trying to bring down his

regime and exert their inﬂuence in Cambodia.
The Cambodian fear of the Vietnamese made accomodation between

the two nations impossible. Vietnam, a nation of 50 million people,
decided it was best for them to dispose of the provocative government

that ruled 7.5 million people.

Once you leave home and

become a college student, you
don’t see many childrenanymore.
But Pitt students find themselves
in a unique situation with Frick
Elementary School right on,cam-
pus.

Frick, which has preschool
classes as well as grades kinder-
garten through eight, is located
directly across from the Towers on
Fifth Avenue. Some may question

_if having a grade school on a
university campus could be haz-
ardous to the children’s education.
Quite the contrary, according to
Frick’s principal Dr. Rachel Jones.

“Our relationship with the Pitt
campus is a very good one,” said

scussion of Alternati

Jones. “We have a good deal ‘of
communication with the University
and with the Learning Research
and Development" Center (LRDC)
that has benefited our students.”

There are a number_of inter-
actions between the University and
Frick that allow the students of
both schools to be exposed to each
other and to share their close
environment, according to Jones.

“The LRDC has done a number
of things for our students,” Jones
said. “For instance, they have
sponsored field trips and a
graduation party ‘for our eighth
graders. The students--have a good
chance to see a lot of university
activities, like the Homecoming
parade.”

In return, Pitt students are able

to gain valuable experience from
this interaction.

“From time to time,” said
Jones, “we get student teachers
from Pitt’s School of Education.

Also, we have had university__
students tutor our students in math-

for the last three years.”

The 600 students who attend
Frick Elementary School come from
various parts of Oakland. A
number of these students are
non-English speaking children
from Africa, the Hispanic countries
and Vietnam.

Some of the children ride a bus to
school while others walk. Walking
means children are in Oakland
streets. However, there has been
no trouble controlling the students,

The Alternative Curriculum pro-
gram, altype of open classroom
learning program for freshman and
-sophomore students, was the
target of criticism and possible
elimination at Wednesday’s CAS
Council meeting.

The program, which was insti-
tuted six years ago, has undergone
re-evaluation recently because of
its rapidly declining enrollment and
excessive cost. 1

Currently, there are only twenty
students enrolled in Alternative
Curriculum, which operates on a
yearly budget of more than $10. 000.

Irwin J. Schulman, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences said
that he believes the program has
much to offer to students desiring
an informal classroom setting.

--Inside today ’s Pitt News

goes down bad, twice.

Schulman added however that
because of the “financial crunch”

that Pitt is experiencing, some

consideration of eliminating the
program must be made.
Gail McGloin and Hanson

Kappleman, co-coordinators of the ‘

Alternative Curriculum program
and four students enrolled in the
program ‘spoke out in favor of
maintaining the program as part of
the CAS curriculum.

Kappleman and McGloin claim-'
ed that the program allowed for a
lower student-teacher ratio in
addition to building a sense of
community among the students
involved in the program.

Kappleman pointed out that
there are a minimum number of
workshops that a student must
attend to receive credit (a student
may receive 9-15 credits per term).

Most students enroll in more
workshops than necessary. Be-

cause of this, Kappleman said, the —

Alternative Curriculum students
are enhancing their education
voluntarily.

McGloin blamed the decreased
Alternative Curriculum enrollment
on the University's failure to
publicize the program.

' “I just saw the University's
public relations brochure, a slick
publication sent to high school

students. We’re not mentioned,” -

McGloin said.

McGloin also said college stu-
dents today are more oriented to
graduate school and careers than in
the past. This causes them to
register for more formal classes
and less open learning- situations.

Windt Offers Analysis of I980 Presidential Race

By GARY L. TWEED
Pitt News Staff Writer

Dr. Theodore Windt Jr. began
offering a course for upperclass-
men on presidential rhetoric in
1970. Initially 20 students
enrolled. This term, enrollment
was over 500 students.

In numbers alone this qualiﬁes
Windt as the most outstanding
teacher at Pitt. He alone teaches
one out of every four Pitt
undergraduates.

But the substance is there also.
Windt has been a consultant for
Gov. Richard Thornburgh during
his primary campaign, has ap-
peared as apolitical analyst on the
“AM Pittsburgh” television show
and ‘has served on various
professional committees.

With the 1980 Presidential
primaries only months away,
Windt previewed the potential
candidates and gave a perspective
of the Carter administration, as
well as views on the man and the
office.

Q: Looking back over the Carter
administration, how would you
evaluate Carter’s rhetoric and his
performance as a president?
A: I think his performance is better
than his rhetoric. Rhetorically,

_ he’s been inept. He has not been
able, so far as I can see, to rally the
people behind his legislative
programs.» In terms of his
performance, I would probably give
him better marks than most people
would.

He has been able to g'et the
Panama Canal Treaty ratiﬁed;
he took a dramatic step with the
Camp David Summit.... I approve
of his recognition of the People’s
Republic of China....those are the
things I would give him. It was a
pretty fair performance for a
president. I think it was a more
progressive performance than the
first two years of the Kennedy
administration.

Q: Do you think Carter will seek
nomination for a second term?

A: ‘ I’m sure he will be seeking
renomination, and if he gets" it,
re-election to the presidency.

Q: What would Carter’s chances
be if Ted Kennedy ran?

A:_,I think that right now he’s in

a good position to be renominated
unless Ted Kennedy gets out there.
Then it becomes a horse race at
that point.

Q: Could Ted Kennedy wrestle
the nomination from Carter if he
sought ‘it?

A: He would be a formidable
candidate. ‘
Q: What about Gov. Jerry Brown
of California?

A: He certainly has an appeal to a
number of people as he demon-
strated in California and in the late
primaries of 1976. He’s an adroit
politician.- Anybody that can be
against Proposition, 13 in Cali-
fornia, then have it passed and
then switch his stand and con-
fiscate, if you will, the issue as his
own and get away with it is an

extremely adroit politician! I have
a certain amount of admiration for
Jerry Brown.

Q: On the Republican side, who do
you see as potential candidates,
and what do you see as their
chances for nomination?

A: A couple have announced
already. Ronald Reagan is out
publically acting like a candidate.
He will be 70-years-oldbut he looks
15 years younger. He has a strong
constituency. He almost had the
nomination in 1976. 7

Gerald Ford has not ‘ruled out
running again. I personally doubt
that he will.

Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee
has long had presidential ambi-
tions. He’s had public exposure
nationally as the ranking Re-
publican on the Watergate Com-
mittee. He’s viewed as a
moderate. He certainly might be a
candidate.

John Connally has announced his

candidacy and is a very captivating
campaigner. His greatest difﬁculty
would be getting the nomination,
having been a Democrat and so
closely associated with Lyndon
Johnson, his patron.
. I think there would be a
reluctance, on the part of many
Republican voters to support
someone who has been so closely
associated with Johnson in the
past. If he got the nomination, on
the other hand, he would be a very
formidable candidate to oppose
Jimmy Carter. '

Q: Getting back to Carter, how do
you view his chances, if nominated,
at a second term?

A: Well, I think it would be
difficult to defeat Carter in 1980 if
he runs‘ again and gets the
nomination. He’s a sitting

Marijuana Reform Group Sets Up Committees and Budget

By RICHARD COOK

Pitt’s new National Organization.
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
began to formalize its structure
Wednesday night by calling for
applicants for committee chairman
positions and by asking members
to draw up the group's budget.

During their regular meeting

George Tweardy, presiding for the
first time as general chairman,
urged members to submit written
applications for the chairman’s
positions on the lobbying, pro-
gramming, public relations and
membership committees.
NORML’s ﬁfth committee, ﬁ-
nance, is chaired by Mark
Grabowski, who is also treasurer.

Grabowski requested volunteers
to draw up a budget which must be
completed in order to gain
recognition from the Student
Government Board. NORML’s
only funds currently come from
sales of buttons and T-shirts, ‘he
said.

According to Tweardy, the ’

group’s application for SGB recog-

nition and subsequent funding
from the student activity fund was
nearly complete with the "exception
of the budget. Allocations would
be needed for advertising, speak-
ers, ofﬁce supplies and possible
ﬁlm presentations Tweardy added.

He called for‘ ’a vote on the
subject of membership dues that
resulted in the passage of a $2

initiation fee and dues of $1 per
term.

Al Deroy, advisor to NORML,
stressed that Pitt’s NORML was
not affiliated financially with the
national group but was using its
name. '

“They’re letting us use their
name with their blessings,” Deroy
said. ‘

Cambodia separating it from
communist Vietnam.

Zasloff said that Pot’s regime
“will rank as one of the most
radical in the 20th century.” Pot
had been known for his massive
oppression and may have been
responsible for over one million
deaths.

Pot’s ‘chances of returning to
power are not very good, according
to Zasloff. There have been reports
of successful guerrilla warfare
against the Vietnamese in western
Cambodia. But, whether Pot is
involved no one knows. Zasloff
said it appears that the Vietnamese
will be in control of Cambodia for

some time.

The question’ that arises is
whether their takeover will prove to
be worth it. The Vietnamese
economy is in a shambles.
Propping up a new state, one that
is the poorest in Southeast Asia,
could prove to be a difficult and
costly task for the Vietnamese.

   A Mild
Success

Change rarely occurs overnight and, while the
faces in the Student Government Board will change
Mar. 1, president-elect Stan Galanski will inherit

‘ more than the legacy of that position from president
- Josh Baylson. , ‘\

Galanski comes to the office after a year as aboard
member, just as Baylson did before him. As Baylson
learned the ropes during his days.in Bernie Payne’s
administration and then put his lessons to use, so will
Galanski. '

It is a rare board that can start fresh and a rarer

‘one that does. Most presidents come into office with _

certain illusions about the extent of their powers and

.capabilities; once there, most find frustration in

trying to accomplish what they set out to do. So it
was with Baylson and so it will be with rGa,lanski.,

But Baylson accomplished some important things,

frustrations and all.

Baylson’s efforts for Pitt to establish a student’

lobby in Harrisburg were realized. Not only does
Pitt have a voice in the legislature, but it is a viable
force, and some of the credit for it goes to Baylson,
who encouraged the project, and to Galanski who
spearheaded the effort.

The lobby was formed during last year’s budget
crisis. While the situation’s once desperate state soon
took on an appearance of calm and most students
believed that the issue was finished, Baylson knew it
was not. ' . -

The board could easily" have dropped the lobby
once the alarm was over, but Baylson not only of-
ficially established the Public and Governmental
Relations Committee, but expanded it to deal with
the pending drinking and marijuana bills.

The lobby was at project to which Galanski gave
much effort and on which he built his reputation as
an active board member.

Not only~"is this committee a strong point for
Galanski’s administration to build upon, but in-
coming board member Todd Park has special exper-
tise as he‘ served as chairman of the committee.

Likely, Galanski will find a new area where he will
make his own strides, just as Baylson established the
lobby. But it will be good for his inexperienced
board to hav.e this as a secure part of their operations

and as an example of what student government can '

accomplish at its best. i
And this, if for no other reason, marks the term in
office of Josh Baylson and his board-——Diat'1e Behers.

Despite this bright spot in Baylson’s board, there is
much more that must be done if student government

’ is to serve students effectively. Allocations process

reform, academic reform, student union ren-
novations, commuter problems, scrutiny of ad-
ministration actions and student advocacy within the
university are some of the most immediate issues that
Galanski and his board must grapple. It is up to
Galanski as an experienced member of student.

dents have entrusted him. _

of S More Responses for Jerry Miller

  Demographics and Our Educational System

I am writing in regards to a letter

‘\ written by. Jerry Miller that

appeared in The Pitt News on Jan.
31.

Miller made a number of
comments concerning the decline

in “enrollment at Pitt and the

general academic climate at the
university.

' Miller states that he believes
demographics has nothing to do
with Pitt’s declining enrollment.
He believes that Pitt’s declining
enrollment is caused by a poor
quality of education.

To ignore demographics is to
ignore reality. Anyone who is
familiar with our nation’s demo-
graphics knows we are a- nation
whose median age is steadily

raising. As time goes by there are
fewer college aged people. The
baby boom is” over. Anyone
involved in public education, such
as myself, can cite statistics — of

tion’s public schools. i‘:

For example, the school district I
am involved in has lost 600
students since 1973 or 17 percent of
our total student population. This
is a situation that all colleges and
universities will soon face.

I agree in part with Miller in that

. the university has problems with

poor instruction, high-living ad-
ministrators and _an unresponsive
bureacracy. However, much of the
problem is the students them-
selves. Many are not prepared for

college life. They don’t have a

strong command of the basics.
Because of this they cannot

‘ succeed in college.

They have been ill:prepared by
our public educational system. We
should remember that professors
are not high school teachers. They
are specialists in a given ﬁe1d,
They should not be expected to
teach basic skills to a student.

, Miller implies that state schools
provide a better education. How
can he be sure? Has he ever
attended a state school? I do and I
also believe itto be no better. In
fact it is worse. I. am a full-time

undergraduate work at Pitt and my
graduate work. Overall, my
education at Pitt was far superior.
Miller suggests a state takeover for
Pitt.

How would this solve the
problem? Is the state an instant
cure-all for a university’s ills?

I say no. In fact, things would be
worse. Another bureacratic layer
would be imposed on the university
in the form of the Pennsylvania
Department of Education. A
degree from Pitt is worth far more
than a degree from a state school.
No, state control is not the answer.
The answer is better prepared
students, and an efficient ad-
ministation, as well as good
instruction.

their leaving can be linked to some
failure by university personnel and
where the problem lies primarily
with the student.

Faculty, by the way, are not
unaware of problems in the life of
the institution. Some of us have
had difficulties with mindless
bureaucratic machinery that might
curl Jerry Miller’s hair. We know
of some instructional problems but
need to know of others.

However, Mr. Miller is wrong in
his suggestion that demographic
downturns age not real. Already
there isieividence to show that in
some areas of the university
enrollment declines have had a
negative impact. This is not to
suggest that the situation is
impossible to meet. It does very
deﬁnitely mean that the situation is
serious.

In the last paragraph of his letter
Miller uses the Iranian situation as

' an example of problem solving.

How ludicrous. Iran is close to civil
war. In my opinion the ousting of
the Shah solved nothing. .

It merely eased the way for the
replacement of one totalitarian
regime,~the Monarchy, with
another equally as bad or worse, a
religious-based dictatorship, that
will be dominated by the\Soviets.

No, Miller’s letter appears to be
poorly thought out. Its premises
and conclusions are, illogical.

Phil Davis
CAS 1975

Further, Miller can recognize
that Pitt is a large, urban
institution. It will not be
automatically warm and personal.
As is the case with a city, the
system will be humane only as we
ﬁnd ways to make it so.

I invite the Jerry Millers of Pitt to
let us know their problems. We
will not insure anyone better
"placement on a Gaussian curve. No
one can insure that instruction will
be universally satisfactory. But we
can hear concerns before they
become impossibly frustrating.
There are Senate bodies ready,
willing and able to provide some
help. So Jerry Miller, wherever
and whoever you are, let us hear
your best thoughts.

‘Movie, Movi ’ -5-
Two Flops in One

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Entertainment Editor
Movie, Movie
Directed by Stanley Donen

The old Doublemint Chewing gum commercial slogan “double you
pleasure, double your fun,” claims two for one is best. “Movie,
Movie,” a ﬁlm with two separate storylines that are affectionate spoofs
of 1930s movies,doubles neither pleasure nor fun. George C. Scott's
latest effort tries hard but comes across as ﬂat and bland as chewing
gum left on the bedpost overnight.

Scott and his wife, Trish Van Devere, star in both “Dynamite
Hands” and “Baxter’s Beauties of 1932,” the two segments of
“Movie, Movie.” .

The ﬁrst story deals with a young man, Harry Hamlin, who becomes
a boxer to pay for his sister’s eye operation. Scott plays the gruff
manager and Van Devere the loyal girlfriend.

The second is about a dying Broadway producer named Spats Baxter
(Scott) who is angling for one last smash. Baxter’s daughter has been
away at school for so long she and her father are strangers.

Hoping to become a star, she slips into the cast and becomes the

understudy to the star. Of course, the arrogant star, Van Devere, takes '

the traditional opening night wish, “Break a leg,” too literally and the
understudy steps in to steal the show. _ — l A

The script for “Movie, Movie” opts for cuteness instead of wit,
which mars both performances by Scott. He carries off the manager
role in “Dynamite Hands” rather well but Scott mugs to excess in his
Billy Rose parody for “Baxter’s Beauties.” t

Conversely, Van Devere shines in'the second offering but her acting
in “Dynamite Hands” is studiedly sweet. As the overbearing
Broadway star, she combines camp with elegance.

There are some good performances by the supporting cast. Barry
Bostwick is fine as the earnest young songwriter ordered to write a
score in a single evening in “Baxter’s Beauties” and Art Carney is
sleazily delightful as the lecherous optometrist in “Dynamite Hands.”

“Movie, Movie” is pleasant and well-paced. The problem is that the
picture is in need of an occasional sarcastic dig or healthy injection of
cynicism to add balance. ‘

“Bish,” Stephen Bishop’s latest
release, is a ﬁtting follow-up to his
award winning “Careless" album.
It’s ﬁtting in that “Bish” is
deﬁnitely a step ahead, and Bishop
has made what was superb even
better (if that’s possible).

“Bish” is a rainbow of romanti-
cism and intimacy that owes its

impact to Bishop’s almost ﬂawless
performance. i

Predominantly, the material on
this album, like “Careless,” is
slickly passionate pop ballads.
There are a few exceptions though,
that showcase Bishop's versatility
as a vocalist. V

“Bish” also boasts a slew of
popular music's biggest names.
Present here are Art Garfunkel,
Bill Payne, Natalie Cole, Mike
McDonald, Tom Scott, Chaka Khan
and others.

The album opens up with an

relaxed, intimate atmosphere of a
performance in a living room with
his‘ songs and he succeeds in
creating that personal link with his
audience on a number of selec-
tions. However, just as not all
meetings in living rooms are
intimate or exciting, not all the
songs on the album succeed in
creating the personal mood. .' i

In the ﬁrst song “Dancin’ Boy,”
Chapin clearly communicates the
pride and love a father feels for this
young performing son. Chapin’s
emotions come through without
being at all gushy or overly
sentimental.

In “If You Want to Feel,” deeply
felt lyrics overcome a weak melody.
Chapin advises a lover not to fear
the pain that may accompany an
open expression of love.

The next song, “Poor Damned
F001” is a letdown and suffers from
a worn out country melody and dry
lyrics.

Just when boredom begins to set
in, Chapin saves side one with “I

easily recognizable number—“If I
Only Had a Brain”--from the score
of “The Wizard of Oz.” It’s an
instrumental that might seem
corny initially but it’s taken
seriously by Bishop and is
performed movingly.

“Losing Myself in You” is one of
the album’s brisker numbers that's
followed by “Looking For the Right
One," probably the most enchant-
ing ballad on the album.

‘Everybody Needs Love" is a
mild rocker. “A Fool at Heart" is a
rhythm and blues number with

"Can Love Do.”

Wonder What Would Happen to
This World.” The upbeat gospel
melody with harmonies provided
by the Dixie Hummingbirds sets
feet stompin’ and hands clappin’
while Chapin asks what would
happen “if a man‘tried/ to take his
time on earth/ and prove before he
died/ what one mans life could be
worth.” The next cut, “Jenny,” is
another worn out country love song
that can not keep up the pace.

“You Only Love Me When It
Rains” is a song detailing the pain
of an uncertain love affair, opens
side two. It rises only slightly
above mediocre. Again, Chapin’s
lyrics lack the vivid imagery and
emotion that are his strongpoints.

“Why Do Little Girls” follows
and is perhaps the best song on the
album. Chapin combines a
throbbing folk banjo melody with
angry lyrics denouncing society’s
constant practice of casting women
in inferior roles.

“Flowers are Red” ‘goes back to

Another ballad follows, “Only

couple of campy swing-oriented
tunes,

“Bish" ﬁnishes with an inno-
cent, delicate ballad,“When‘ I Was

Stephen BishopMakes at Good Thing EvenBetter  

Friday, February 9, l979—Page 7

By DAVID R. MAYHER
Pitt News Staff Writer

For those of you who have read
the book “Watership Down, ” there
is a new movie out under the same
name which will deepen your
fascination with that novel. Those
of you who go to see the movie
without having the opportunity to
have read the book—good luck.

Martin Rosen, who wrote as well
as directed the ﬁlm, seems to take
for granted that everyone has read
the book. The rabbits hop from one
adventure to another and the

audience is left bewildered as to
what is going on. It takes detailed

narration to explain and justify
action in a novel, and this simply
can’t be done in a short,
action-packed ﬁlm.

For example, the rabbits’ ven-
ture to Cowslip’s warren makes up
six whole chapters of the book; on
the screen it uses two minutes,
losing the impact of an important
socio-political comment the author,
Richard Adams, makes in his
novel. Cowslip’s warren is a group
of helpless, sophisticated rabbits
leading unnatural lives—being fed
lettuce and carrots by a farmer who
also sets traps for them. They have
no natural enemies and abundant

food, so they ignore the fact that,
every so often, one ‘of them
disappears. They are unaware that
they are being manipulated, as
Fiver soon realizes.

Also, Richard Adams invented a
number of words used by the
rabbits in their language (Owslafa,
silﬂay, hraka) and he included an
entire glossary explaining these
terms. Rosen uses these words
without hesitation and seemingly
without regard for those with no
previous knowledge of “Watership
Down.”

The movie seems concerned only

with the activity and violence the
rabbits encounter throughout their
odyssey and not their individual
characteristics. Adams gave each
rabbit a deﬁnite personality, so one
could relate to their predicament. It
is an individual’s character that
makes an audience feel compassion
for him. Some argue that an
animated film allows little room for
characterization, but without it, the
action seems meaningless.

For those who know the book,
the movie should be an enjoyable
experience. The movie may move

fast, but its a lot of fun seeing these '

‘Watership Down’ Too Condensed from Book

characters (the ones Rosen ‘bothers
to develop) “made real” on screen.

Kehaar, the seagull, virtually
steals the show. Speaking‘ with a
Russian Jewish accent (the voice is
Zero Mostel’s), he struts and
squawks his way about for most of
the ﬁlm’s laughs.

General Woundwort and Bigwig
look and act like you hope they
would and the animated English
scenery is just wonderful.

melodies with lyrics that are often
sensitive, sometimes amusing and

usually low-key. McTell’s warmth
and light hearted humor are quite
evident and easily appreciated.

There are quite a few pleasant
songs on this album, which was
recorded at concerts in London and
Sydney. ‘

“Big Tree” tells of a six-year
old’s first experience with the
opposite sex. McTell remembers
those days, innocent days when “I
showed her/ she showed me/ lots
of fun behind the big tree.”

“Michael in the Garden” is a

sensitive exploration of the private

world of an autistic child.
“Zimmerman Blues” expresses

disillusionment with the sixties in
general and Bob Dylan in particu-
lar.

McTell explores the joy of
growing old not with the woman of
your dreams but with the woman
who satisﬁes your needs in the
haunting “Naomi.”

The next song “Sylvia” is
dedicated to the late poet Sylvia
Plath. He makes a sympathetic
attempt to understand her suicide

and the result is a beautiful yet sad .

and extremely emotional eulogy.

“Streets of London’,’ explores
the empty lives of those who live
alone in London. “Ralph McTell
Live” is a fine album which gives a
vivid picture of the performer and
the man. -

In 1932, Herbert Hoover ran for
re-election, but the circumstances

were extraordinary, with the
Depression, and he was not
re-elected.

A third president is Jerry Ford,
of course, but again he came into
the presidency under extraordinary

circumstances. He had never been '

elected either to the presidency or
vice presidency, had been ap-
pointed and had the weight of
Watergate and a declining Re-
publican registration in the
country.

Q: How do you see the 1980
presidential race as differing from
past presidential races?

THE SENTINEL

A: One of the things interesting
about 1980 is that since 1840 every
president elected in a year ending
with zero has died in ofﬁce
Since 1840! You can take it right

’ William Henry Harris, 1840.

I don’t want to predict anything.
Obviously, I don’t believe some-
thing like that would happen but
it’s just one of those quirks of
history I guess.

As it is, “Movie, Movie’f is too much like the genuine article--the
slurpy little ﬁlm of the 1930s that could send and incipient diabetic over
the edge in ﬁve minutes. “Movie, Movie” obviously was prepared
with loving homage to that film tradition but officiandos would be

better off to watch genuine oldies like “Champion” and “The Great .

not such a great deal.

Beat St. Frmcis, 65-57

Panthers   Meet Over-Confident Blue Devils

By CRIS HOEL
PittNewsStaffWriter ‘

DURHAM, N.C.—What sort of
team has Pitt coach Tim Grgurich
brought here to duel Duke’s Blue
Devils, who may be the nation’s
ﬁnest fivesome? —

The Panthers are a team recently
recovered from a numbing series of
shattering losses. The Panthers
are a team whose sturdy ‘star, Sam
Clancy, is injured. The Panthers
are a team that in few ways
matches Duke on paper.

And the/Panthers are a group of
players who may be set to startle
the Atlantic Coast Conference
(ACC) tomorrow night and ‘the rest
of the country, by way of the-
Sunday newspapers’ scores the
next morning.

A 65-57 win against St. Francis
Wednesday night at the Field
House sent Pitt toward Durham
with a 13-8 record and a six-game
winning’ streak.

The Panthers brought an estab-
lished—and efficient-starting
lineup to Durham. If Pitt’s plan to
press Duke is supported by a smart
performance from each of the
seven Panthers who can be
expected to play, tomorrow’s
contest should not be the massacre -
Duke’s backers believe it will be.

Duke fans have reason for
expecting a one-way game. Duke’s
starters—center Mike Gminski,
forwards Ken Dennard and Gene
Banks and guards Bob Bender and
Jim Spanarkel—took their team to
the NCAA championship game last
season despite youth and a
hazardous schedule. This season’s
team is different from last’s in that-

‘ it runs less, features an improved

all-America player (Gminski) and
(at least through 20 games) wins
more (17-3 vs. 15-5).

One thing that remains at Duke,
and at all ACC schools, is a difficult

schedule. Pitt, in fact, is to Duke’s
schedule what St. Francis or
Mercyhurst was to Pitt—a nagging
opponent that « could stay close
throughout the game.

Pitt’s press could bother Duke,
as St. John’s did during one of
Duke’s losses this season. Carlton
Neverson and Wayne Williams
have used the quickened pace of
Pitt’s new defense to rattle
opponents and produce Pitt points.
Pitt’s offense, especially when it
gives Clancy the ball with his huge
back facin the basket, has been
calm—-at times dangerously calm—
of late, but the defense and some
fortunate shooting has masked that
problem in recent wins.

Duke will take Pitt lightly; Pitt
plans to peak here, since this game
will hold much importance that will
transcend the change of record.
And so it could be that Pitt, which
has calmed lately and won because
of it, could be ready to storm a
band of unsuspecting but talented
Blue Devils tomorrow night.

——Clancy’s calf injury, suffered
during the Hawaii win, did not
prevent him from accumulating 13
rebounds (just short of his second-
in-the-country average) against St.
Francis, but it may have caused
Grgurich to replace him with Terry
Knight during a portion of
Wednesday night’s first half.
Clancy’s injury comes at the same
time Gene Banks——like Clancy, a
terrific sophomore forward from
Pennsylvania—is playing with a
sore foot for Duke.

—Knight, who continues to
provide steady play when Pitt
requires it, scored 15 points against
St. Francis to ‘lead the Panthers,
who also received 13 points from
both Sam Ellis and Clancy.

Neverson, whose improvement at ~

shooting guard has come at a time
(Continued on page 10)

Pitt and Sam clancy may find that any resemblance between the mquesne Dukes and the team from Duke is

Purely coincidental.

Wrestlers’ Maxwell Set For Foes at Pitt Quadrangular  

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor

Pitt 118-pounder Glenn Maxwell
really “caught hell” for the way he
was wrestling. 8

“I wasn’t doing’ very well at the
beginning of the season,” Maxwell
admitted, “so I had a big meeting
with the coaches and they
straightened things out. They put
my head on straight.”

The result—an 8-2-2 individual
record which includes a four-match
winning streak. His three-match
win-by-fall streak was stopped
when he superior-decisioned Lock
Haven’s Kevin Dixon, 18-1.

So going into tomorrow’s Pitt
Quadrangular at the Field House (1

p.m.) against ninth-ranked Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) rival
Cleveland State, Navyand William
& Mary, Maxwell is one of the
hottest Ranthers.

“It’s about time,” Pitt head
coach Dave Adams’ said. “We
were really disappointed with him
when he came back from Christmas
vacation. He wasn’t wrestling well
at all.” ~

Maxwell wasn’t wrestling well
enough to compete when the
season opened. Baptist Bible
transfer Dan Kublick beat him out
of the starting spot and performed
against Bloomsburg and in the
Penn State Invitational.

“He (Maxwell) was just getting
beat out,” Adams said. “There’s
no excuse—he just got beat.”

Maxwell, a sophomore who
already had a visit to the NCAA
ﬁnals last year as a freshman,
never faced having to sit out in a
varsity match.

“I was on the varsity for all four
years of high school,” Maxwell
said. “And when my roommates
(150-pounder Ed Bredniak, 177-
pounder Jim Gordon, and manager
Bob Meyers) left for Penn State, all
my friends were gone. I’d much
rather be on the mat.”

A team needs a lead to get it
fired‘ up, and so far Maxwell has

provided that lead in the last four
bouts.

“Any team counts on the
lightweights,” Maxwell said. “It
makes a big difference winning the
first two matches. That’s what
happened at Lehigh (a 24-17 Pitt
loss). We lost the ﬁrst two weight

classes and went flat.”

Maxwell will be needed to supply
early leads if the Panthers (5-5)
hope to up their dual meet record
and improve on their 1-2 EWL

‘mark.

“I like quadrangulars, ” Maxwell
said. “More than regular matches.
They’re almost like tournaments.
And we have 18 days until the EWL
Tournament (at the Field House

Feb. 24-25), so we’re going to get
ready.” . ~

MAT NOTES: Pitt will open the
quadrangular against Navy, while
Cleveland State meets William &
Mary. Then it will be Pitt-William
& Mary, Cleveland State-Navy,

and ﬁnally Pitt-Cleveland State, ~

Navy-William & Mary...all four
teams have the same strengths-.-at
158, 167, and 177, while CSU
boasts 150-pound Greg Drenik and
heavyweight Tim Payne (last year’s
EWL Champion) as two other

standouts...Navy’s best wrestler is 5 

150-pound Larry Kihlstadium,
while W&M has 126-pounder Jim

Pagano and heavyweight Jeff,

Godwin on their side.

Pantherettes Crack   Rock, 56-53, In Key Regional Game

By ANNA ARLOTTA
\ Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Pantherettes won an
important regional basketball game
at the expense of Slippery Rock
State College, 56-53, Wednesday
night at the Field House.

“We played bad and they played
worse,” head coach Jean Balthaser
said. “You put a win like this in
your back pocket and don’t look
back.”

Turnovers were a big factor in
the game as the Pantherettes

  Swimmers Love Underdog Cleveland State For Its Pool

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s swim team (8-0) -had an
ulterior motive when it scheduled
Cleveland State before the season.
Expecting to qualify many of its

3 swimmers, Pitt wanted to become

more familiar with the Vikings’
pool, the site of this year’s National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Championship.

“It’s good for our guys to get

p, acclimated to the pool now,” Pitt
. coach Fred Lewis said. “This way,

turned the ball over 33 times.

After a Stephanie Stripling
basket put Pitt ahead 24-14,
mistakes led to four unanswered
Rockette points, cutting’ the Pan-
therettes’ lead to 24-18 at halftime.

“Offensively we had so much
trouble,” Balthaser said. “A team
like Slippery Rock should not be
able to stay with us man-to-man. It
was the folding of our offense that
allowed_ them to keep up.”

The Rockettes forced Pitt into a
two-guard situation, instead of its

they can see the key points of both
thebuilding and the pool and use
them to their advantag in
March.” »

Cleveland State, according to
Lewis, has one of the ﬁnest swim
facilities in the world, but the team
is not as good. The Vikings are
decisive underdogs in tomorrow’s
meet. _

“They have’ some good indivi-
duals and are very strong in the
sprint‘ events, but we are better,”
Lewis said. “We should have no

. pool

usual three-forward offense. The
Pantherettes had so many pro-
blems with Slippery Rock’s defense
that Carol Dugan, suffering from a
stress fracture was put into the
game to add control to the Pitt
offense. ~
“Carol was ready against West
Virginia (a 69-67 Pantherette win),
but we didn't have to use her,”
Balthaser said. “Against Slippery
Rock it was necessary to put her in.
“We were having trouble with
the ball so we had to go back to

problems with them.”

Although Lewis denies it, the
Panthers probably will be concern-
ed with learning more about the
than defeating Cleveland
State.

“Sure, our direct reason for
swimming them is because of their
pool, but we also want to beat
them,” Lewis said. “We aren’t
spending all that money going up
there just to ﬁnd out about their
pool.”

The NCAA championship is

playing with two guards. We
needed a big guard and Carol
responded (seven rebounds in 10
minutes of play).”

In the second half, Slippery Rock
took control, 33-32, with 12 minutes
left to play. But Rockette turnovers
and a Robin Fry conversion at the
foul line with seconds remaining
gave Pitt the three-point victory.

“We just can’t seem to get up for
Slippery Rock,” Balthaser said.
“But we had some bright points.
Robin played a real nice game for

important to Pitt, which has won its
last 18 dual meets. The Panthers
want ‘to be nationally ranked and

they must do well at the NCAA)

Championship to gain their goal.
Dual meet records do not
determine national rankings.
Consequently, any new information
that the Panthers may gain about
the pool this weekend may help
them do better at the NCAA

championship at Cleveland State,

early next month.

SWIM NOTES: Two Panthers

us (11 ‘points -and 11 rebounds). We

had so much trouble with then"?

but we’re at a point right now in the
season where a win is a win.”

Wanda Randolph led the Pan-

therettes with 18 points, followed

_ by Fry with 11 and Stripling with
10.

Pitt will take a rest before a long _
weekend trip including. two impor- .

tant regional contests, one at St.
Joseph’s on Saturday and another
at Delaware Monday night.

tomorrow will try to earn a return
trip to Cleveland. Stu Swanson
(200-yard backstroke) and Mark

Schuman (100-yard butterﬂy) are \

expected to qualify for the NCAA
Championship...No Panthers have
yet qualiﬁed. Most probably will
qualify, at next . month’s Eastern
Regional championship to be held
at Penn State...On Wednesday,
Pitt was still ranked second in the
East...Harvard, which met third-
ranked Princeton last weekend,
remained in first.

Tracksters Travel to Columbus to Take Test at Ohio State

‘By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
February is a month for tests,
both academic and athletic, for the
members of Pitt’s varsity teams.
Tonight the Panther track squad
will face its ‘most important test to
date as Pitt meets Ohio State and
Wisconsin in a triangular meet in
Columbus.
In 1977, when Pitt and Ohio State
last met in a tri-meet, the outcome
was so close it was decided by the

Women

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Although it has a dual meet at
Slippery Rock tomorrow, Pitt’s
women’s track team (0-1) plans to
relax.

“We’re using this as more or
less a tuneup for next weekend’s
Princeton Relays,” Pitt coach
Alfreeda Goff ‘ said. “Slippery
Rock, according to our statistics

ﬁnal event, the 1600 meter relay.
Tonight’s me'et could be another
cliffhanger with important races in
the middle and shorter distance
events. V, I .

Three Panthers out to qualify for
the NCAA indoor championships
are Darren Geary, 800 meters,
Gary Siriano, 1500 meters and
Larry Kinney, triple jump. The
qualifying standards for these
events are 1:51.5, 3:45 and 52 feet,
respectively.

“The track at Ohio State is not
partigularly fast,” said Siriano. “It
won’t be as good an opportunity to
qualify as next week (at Illinois
State).  , .

Kinney, who has the Pitt record
for this event, would need about a
foot and a half more to qualify but
the fact that he has jumped 50-6 at
all this season is amazing because
Kinney wears flats in competition
instead of spikes.

“_Larry has to have jumped the

farthest of any triple jumper
around who wears only ﬂats, “said
jumping coach Dan Goodyear.
“We’re looking for a good pair of
spikes for him but for now it’s
unbelievable that he can jump so
far without them.”
Kinney and Geary are freshmen.

Geary ran his split of the two-mile
relay last weekend in about 1:52, so

he has an excellent chance to

qualify in the 800 meters, which is
slightly shorter than 880 yards.

Wisconsin has depth in the
distance events. The team ﬁnished
ﬁfth at the NCAA cross country
championships last November, a
fact that indicates exactly where
their strength lies.

So tonight it won’t be number 2
pencils and computerized answer
sheets for Panther thinclads but
instead a 400-meter track and a
jumping runway. The test is
scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.

Regulars Relax for Tracksters-Rockettes Meet

not really strong. They seem to be
much more competitive during the
outdoor season.” “

At the Pitt Invitational last

jweekend, Slippery Rock did not

‘score, while the hostess Panther-
ettes ﬁnished sixth, missing third
place _by only a few points. _
“They really don’t have any
outstanding, individuals,” Goff

said. “They have brought in a few
new names from last year, but none
are all that spectactllar.”

Last year, the Pantherettes
clobbered Slippery Rock by almost
40 points. g I

Pitt will use several of its
reserves against the Rockettes.
Runners Carol Grober, Debbie
Sczmansky, Donna Pangburn, and
Francie Lagana, none ~-of whom

ordinarily travel with the team, are
expected to compete Sunday.

The Panthers will be led by Peri
Jude Radecic. The freshman from
Brentwood, considered a potential
Olympian by Goff, has broken the
team record in the shot put three
times.

Meanwhile, another starter-
sprinter Gwen Murray—will miss
the meet with a hamstring pull.

President Josh Baylson gave the Presidents report beginning with two open
meetings sponsored by the Legal Awareness Committee. The fist conc erns ad-
missions to Law school: the correct procedures, to be held" Monday, Fe b. 12, at
4:00 in Dining room A. The second meeting: relates to the pros andcons of renting
apartments which will be held, Tuesday, Feb._13th in the KUTIZITBR room. The
Inter—Resident Board meeting held Monday January 29th was thelast ite m on the
President's report. The IRB voted unanimously to reject support for the p roposed
Engineering Student Cabinet Amendment. . -

Mike Seitz, Allocations Committee Co-ordinator reported on the current budget

-» modification requests made by BAS, PISO, and AISU at last Mondays allocations

meeting. These recommendations were passed by the Board merrbe rs.

Nello Giorgetti of the College Young Democrats’ spoke before the Bard stating the
CYD’s sentiments towards certain Policies and Procedures followazl by th e Alloca-
tions Committee. Speciffically the organization opposes any’ typed blan k et policy
which would affect each group regardless of its particular request. Presid ent, Josh
Baylson replied by stating he hopes that organizations lwouid prioritize their
requests to aid allocations committee members in their budget reocmmen d ations.
Board Member, Jan Medoff reported on the results of the entertainment survey
that was conducted during the 1978 Fall term. According to these results, rock
music was voted the most popular by students with jazz, countryrock, classical,
and soul following respectively. The majority of students find it convenient to
attend ‘ musical events on campus. «The types of entertainment preferred by
students are concerts and small shows, and a high percentage ofstuden ts would
like to attend such a program more than once every three months The surveyed
students felt a.fair price range for shows would fall between the$4 to_ $10,000
range. Jan Medoff made three basic recommendations; (1) priority should be
given to on or near campus rock shows, preferably-“album-orierted” sh ows, (2)
small shows can be used to fill the other musical tastes prevalentat Pitt, (3) more

low-priced musical events should be produced with local or “up and caring" talent.

A report of the Thursday, February 1st Student Assembly Meefrg was given by

Board member, Stan Galanski. He critisized the apathy and pea atten dance of
organizations on campus and called for suggestions to improve irierest a nd atten-
dance. The SGBA meeting was called as a special meeting to dscuss the_ pro-

posed ESC amendment. Those who attended the meeting votedunanim ously to .

oppose the amendmvnt. The Assembly decided on a future neeting date, of
Thursday, March 8th to discuss the possibilities of a Student Activities Fee in-
crease. If such an increase is instituted, recognized student orgaization s benefit
most from such an increase. ’

David Hesidenceloffered a position paper to the SGB as_the Board's official
position on the proposed ESC amendment. He called for the SGBto den y support
of the amendment on the grounds that certain clauses within theamend ment are
