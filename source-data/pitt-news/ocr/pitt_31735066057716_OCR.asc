Crowell and J.C.s take SGB elections

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

The J .C. slate dominated yes-
terday’s Student Government
Board elections, as Julie Crowell
was elected president with 58
percent of the votes and Julie
Clouse gamered the most votes
for board members.

J .C. slate-mate John Capriotti
was elected to the board as well,
coming in second behind Clouse.

“I’m very honored to be elect-
ed as president. But I’m also
very shocked, and that’s why I
had no comment when they told
me, because I never really
expected it to happen,” Crowell
said. “The campaign did get a
negative response because of the
disqualiﬁcation, but all in all I’d
just like to thank Heath [Golden]
for a fair campaign.” 5

Crowell, who defeated two
other presidential candidates fol-
lowing the disqualification of
Chris Fedeli, said she was
amazed that her two slate mem-
bers, Clouse and Capriotti, Came
in ﬁrst and second among board
candidates.

Crowell’s platform included
plans to establish relationships
between the student govern-
ments at the branch campuses
and to create a community rela-
tions committee to serve as a
community service liaison and

Heath Golden finished second

“Our slate — Julie Crowell,

Proposed changes to the uni-
versity’s health care beneﬁts pro-
gram have sparked a debate
among Pitt faculty and staff who
favor the plan currently in place.

Discussion centering around a
proposed multi-year relationship
with Blue Cross was fueled at
yesterday’s meeting of Senate
Council after Senate members
expressed concern that one of
the university’s ﬁve health care
options, HealthAmerica, would
be eliminated.

Of the ﬁve health care beneﬁts
options currently available, four
are Blue Cross-based and one is
provided by HealthAmerica.
According to Senate President
James Holland, approximately
30 percent of eligible Pitt

HealthAmerica.

Greeks vital

to blood drive

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

If you walked into Forbes
Quad last week, you might have
thought you were at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center or any other
hospital for that matter.

Nurses were scurrying
around carrying scissors, wear-
ing stethoscopes, taking blood
pressures and checking your
medical history ——- all so they
Could take your blood.

Last week the Central Blood
Bank (CBB) visited Forbes
Quad as part of the Panhellenic
Association and Interfraternity
Council’s Greek Week.

“The blood bank really appre-
ciates all the help from Pitt stu-
dent groups. The groups like
the nurses and resident life help
us out immensely, but it’s really
the Greeks that put us over the
top,” said Paige Allen, field
consultant for the blood bank.

The bank had been in an
emergency phase since last
Thursday, requiring all elective
surgeries to be postponed due to
lack of blood. The Greek drive
alone helped the bank not to
postpone any surgeries, said
Allen. .

The Pitt Greeks are the single
largest givers at Pitt and the
second largest in Western
Pennsylvania. The Greeks
encouraged students and faculty
or anyone else to come and
give, according to Paul Dunn,
co-chairrnan of the drive.

This year the Greeks collect-
ed 943 pints of blood, even
though 283 people were
deferred because of health relat-
ed situations.

The act of giving blood only
takes about ten minutes, but the
whole process takes around a
hour

The nurses start by checking

the donor’s medical history..

They do a verbal screening
process, ask if you weigh over
103 lbs. and test your iron level
and blood pressure.

All donors are also required
to read a handout about high
HIV risk to determine if they
are people at risk of infection,
according to Allen.

“I like to give here, because
you can just stop in and you

don’t have to have an appoint-I

ment,” said Susan Sunseri, a
graduate student of education.

“I try to give a couple times a
year whenever [the blood bank
is] on Pitt’s campus. I don’t
mind giving, because it doesn’t
bother me and especially now
since they're on a shortage.” .

Each house or sorority lS
required to serve a total of four
hours in the resting area. Since
the blood drive is part of Greek
Week, the Greeks compete for
places one through five by the
number of pints given, based on
one percent of house size, said
Dunn.

Everyone who donates blood
is required to sit in a resting
area for 15 minutes and is sup-
plied with free cookies and
juice.

Internet

-From page 1
“One of the things special about the

‘Internet is that it goes beyond govern-

ment,” Sucevic said. “It’s like anarchy:
no one rules and anyone can do any-
thing. There’s always a way that if some-
one wants the information, they can get
around the system and access it.”

Pitt might make a stand against
pornography on the Internet without
having the ability to implement it,
Neufeld said.

Pitt will consider how it will imple-
ment its policies as it forms them, said
Paul Stieman, associate vice chancellor
for computing and infomiation services.

“It doesn’t make sense if you can’t
implement it,” he said.

The Internet is connected to more than
3.5 million computers and Pitt cannot
control Intemet access beyond Pitt com-
puter labs, he said.

But even if certain information is

barmed from Pitt’s sewer, a user can still
access another server anywhere around
the world from a Pitt computer, Musi
said. A server is the machine that holds
the messages that students can access.

Even if students can get around
restrictions, limiting access to pomegra-
phy on the Internet would welcome a
flood of questions about who should
govern and moderate the Internet, Musi
said. Universities are the primary users
of the Internet, and they will follow the
lead of other universities, just as Pitt
now responds to what CMU did, he said.

Pitt’s executive committee for acade-
mic computing will make a recommen-
dation to the administration after study-
ing various legal issues wrapped up in
the Internet, including the pornography
issue, Stieman said.

Committee members will discuss
Internet access issues with students, fac-
ulty and staff while forming the policies.

Also on next year’s Board, Paul Ufberg said he was
looking forward to working with the other members.

“I think Julie’s going to be an excellent president, and
there’s a lot of things to look forward to that this board
can do,” Ufberg said.

Current president Ross Pasquale said both registered
candidates were extremely qualiﬁed and he would have
trusted either to carry out the duties of the office.

Second place presidential candidate Golden said he’s
conﬁdent Julie would do a good job.

“Julie’s a good candidate, and I wish her the best of
luck. We remained friends throughout the whole thing,”
Golden said. “Voter turnout was rather disappointing. I
guess I hoped it would have been higher.”

Pasquale said he didn’t know why voter turnout was
significantly less than last year, with only 1,367 stu-
dents voting compared to 2,648 the previous year.

Senate

°From page 1
Pitt community dated yesterday states that
exclusive Blue Cross coverage would result
in savings which would result in reduced
health insurance premium payments.

As a result of the proposed relationship
with Blue Cross, the insurance provider
would require Pitt to offer only Blue Cross
options.

Holland said the substantial amount of Pitt
employees who currently enroll in
Hea1thAmerica’s program would be adverse-
ly affected by making Blue Cross Pitt’s sole
provider of medical coverage.

“The business of changing the doctors and
changing the whole health care perspective
from those HealthAmerica centers that con-
centrate on keeping you well instead of [oth-
ers that concentrate on] treating you when
you’re sick — that’s a big blow,” Holland
said. “And 30 percent. of the (employees)
would have to suffer that blow.”

Among the proposed changes in health
care coverage is the exclusion of coverage for
single-child households. Professor Herb
Chesler criticized the omission of single-child
coverage, calling it a “gross discouttesy” that
faculty and staff involved in the medical

insurance review committee were not proper-
ly notiﬁed of this exclusion.
“I’ m surprised at that. I’m shocked,”

Chesler said. “I was totally unaware [of the

decision]  and I think that whatever process
that was used to produce that result is
ﬂawed.”

Despite its promises to reduce current pre-
miums, Holland also said he cannot see how
the Blue Cross plan can save employees
money, despite the proposal’s claim that
health care premiums would initially be
reduced by more than 20 percent from cur-
rent premiums.

“That ‘magical’ savings has not been docu-
mented [as far as] how they’re going to do

it,” Holland said. “They’re going to lose .

money and pay for it out of the reserves the
next few years. They’ll be the sole provider
after that  what are you gonna do?”

But Lewis said the proposal is not set, as of
yet, and still allows for input from employees.
“We knew the proposal was on the table, and
this was a recommendation from the medical
rates committee as well that should inform
people about what was going on,” Lewis
said. “We will take any suggestions.”

However, professor Richard Tobias said he

felt the widely circulated letter may have tried
to persuade employees to avoid enrolling in
HealthAmerica during the open enrollment
period later this month. He said a section of
Lewis’ letter which reads “employees think-
ing about enrolling in Healtl1America during
the health care open enrollment period 
should consider that decision very carefully”
sounds like a warning against involvement in
the HealthAmerica. plan. “It looks to me as if
the letter says, ‘Do not enroll in
HealthAmerica,”’ Tobias said. “It eliminates
HealthAmerica as one of our choices.”

Lewis said the “caution” statement
appeared in the letter only because the Blue
Cross proposal suggests the elimination of
HealthAmerica.

“The proposal is for us to have [an exclu-
sive] partnership with Blue Cross,” she said.
“I think we would be fiscally irresponsible
not to look at it. It’s a substantial saving.”

Enrollment in the HealthAmerica plan will
stay open until a decision about whether or
not to accept the Blue Cross proposal is
made. According to Lewis’ letter, ,a decision
on accepting Blue Cross as Pitt’s sole
provider of health care coverage is expected
to be made by spring 1995.

Rally

°Fromrpage 1
two lovers is the most beauti-
ful thing we know,” Godwin
said.

CMU’s Vice Provost for
Education Erwin Steinberg
defended the university’s deci-
sion which he said was made
because many of the images
would violate the state’s
pornography laws.

Images on the Internet
include forced sex acts involv-
ing women, children and ani-
mals, Steinberg said.

But no school has ever been
liable for carrying this materi-
al on the Internet, Godwin
said. And this fear of liability
draws on a legal myth, said
Vic Walczak, executive direc-
tor of the local American Civil
Liberties Union.

Carnegie Mellon cannot be
held responsible for every-
thing that is on the network,
Walczak said, citing a case in
which CompuServe, a compa-
ny that sells subscriptions to
the Internet, was sued because
of material carried on the
Internet. The judge in that
case decided that the company
cannot be held liable for that
material.

“CMU does not have to take
this action,” Walczak said.

‘ “The principle here is academ-

ic freedom ...”

CMU has hurt its reputation
with its decision, said Peter
Berger, a Carnegie-Mellon
alumnus and lawyer from
Telerama Internet.

“You can’t be just a little bit
dead. You can’t be just a little
bit pregnant. You can’t throw
away just a little bit of acade-
mic integrity and expect the
world to respect you,” he said.

Many students who attended
the rally said they do not use
the Internet to view sexually
explicit material, but they
believe that CMU has violated
the ﬁrst amendment.

“I’m mad, I'm fed up with
the CMU administration that
doesn’t stand up for free
speech but caves in from some
fear of radical censorship
freaks,” said CMU student
Justin Boyan.

Students also objected to the
fact that CMU is considering
barming bulletin boards on the
Intern-et that allow users to
discuss sex in an explicit man-
net.

But some of the bulletin
boards contain information
about safe sex and allow open
discussion about a subject
that society hides too much,
said CMU student Tony
Rippy, a sophomore computer
science major.

As the crowd of about 150

. people chanted “hey hey ho,

censorship must go,” other
students and staff peered out
from Warner Hall and bowed
their heads over open win-
dows to view the rally.

The rally was organized
by CMU students and dis-
proves the theory that CMU
students are apathetic, said
Andrew Sproule, the editor-in-
chief of CMU’s student news-
paper, The Tartan.

Before the election, we met with all the candidates so we
could learn from the them what they felt were the most
important issues facing the university and what should be
done to solve them. From these meetings we formulated our
endorsements, which we announced on Monday. But we also
discussed amongst ourselves many of the issues and pro-
posed solutions raised at these meetings. We would like to
take this opportunity to express our recommendations for
SGB’s next term.

A major problem at Pitt is the apathy of the student body
and general lack of interest in the activities of the SGB.
SGB meetings and open forums are very poorly attended by
the student body. To correct this, many of the candidates,
nearly all in fact, suggested that the SGB members quit
holding their meetings in their office and stop “talking into a
tape recorder.”

This is an important and wise step for SGB to take, but
this is still far from a solution. Meetings also need to be
better advertised. Ads in The Pitt News should be run before
the day of the meetings, ﬂiers could be put up on campus
and other methods of getting the word out to students should
be utilized. Of course, while the SGB needs to take these
steps, the students themselves must take the initiative
to attend these meetings and take an interest in the universi-
ty. ~
We also suggest SGB develop a newsletter which could
serve two purposes. One, to inform the students of the topics
and content of SGB meetings. The other, to provide a calen-
dar of events on campus. This would provide the students
with a valuable aid as well and make them more likely to
take an interest in SGB. The events calendar would cause
students to pick up the newsletter, and many would likely
read the SGB information as well, thereby seeing SGB’s rel-
evance to their lives.

To president-elect Crowell we suggest that she act as a
leader and a delegator, not merely the most powerful
SGB member. Other presidents in the past have placed
too much emphasis on their own pet projects, to the detri-
ment of other projects and losing the cohesiveness of the
board. The purpose of a president is to lead and represent
the board to the university. It is crucial for the president to
organize the board, members efficiently and to make sure
there is no redundancy of efforts, and also that nothing gets
ignored. »

We wish the best of luck tovall the newly elected members
and hope they will consider these recommendations when
they take office next term.

a S t
spring,
h i 1 e

reading an
issue of that
ri g h t - w i n g
excuse for a
campus news-
paper which
calls itself the
Phoenix, I ran
across a
thought-provoking cartoon. One
part showed a man with a Bible
standing in front of a crowd
labeled as “Christian Communi-
ty” and saying, ‘The God of the
Bible says that homosexuality is
an abomination! He also tells his
people to hate the sin but love
the sinner!” The other was made
up of a group of people calling
him names such as “Nazis!” and
“Hatemongers!” for saying that.
Now, since that paper has an
avowed anti-gay stance, the fact
that it labeled the former a “hate
group” and the latter a “tolerant
group” was supposed to be sar-
castic and ironic. Trouble is, it’s
closer to the truth than a lot of
people may want to admit.

Do you know what the Bible
really says about homosexuality?
Not a whole lot. And therein lies
the problem: When people use
the Bible to denounce homosex-
uality, they are usually motivated
not by Godly righteousness but
by spiritual pride -— that is, they
take the attitude that “we may
have been involved in some sort
of sin, but we NEVER did that!”
Shows how much they know
about sin, huh? Let me leave no
doubt as to where I stand.
Homosexuality is indeed morally
wrong according to Scripture, so
don’t try to change my mind on
that. However, it’s not particular-
ly heinous, as some would like to
you believe; in fact, the Bible
actually teaches that homosexu-
ality is nothing more, and noth-
ing less, than a symptom of what
we Christians believe is ultimate
rebellion against God. Therefore,
it’s no worse than stealing, lying,
swearing, racism, pollution or
even heterosexual sex outside of

marriage.

Now, that may not be what
you have heard. Most people
know of the story of the destruc-
tion of the cities .of Sodom and
Gomorrah in the book of
Genesis, and the traditional inter-
pretation is that they were burned
up primarily because of homo-

sexual behavior. Not so! Ezekiel"

16:49 and 50 say this, my para-
phrase: “Sodom was arrogant,
overfed, unconcerned and did
not help the poor and needy. It
was haughty and did detestable
things toward God. Therefore,
He did away with it as you have
seen.”

And what about Romans 1:26
and 27? Well, consider the rest of
that passage and continue into
chapter 2. Here again that kind of
behavior is a result of rejecting
God, and the apostle Paul begins
chapter 2 with “You [believers],
therefore, have no excuse, you
who pass judgment on someone
else ...” Not only that, the few
other verses where homosexuali-
ty is even mentioned (Leviticus
20:13, for example) are, without
exception, part of a catalogue of
transgressions against God’s law.

However, the Bible also teach-
es that everyone who has ever
lived, with the exception of Jesus
Christ, has run afoul of God —-
and not just the gays, either. It’s
patronizing to the gay communi-
ty to take the attitude that one
should “hate the sin but love the
sinner” when those se1f-right-
eous religionists who have
turned that quote into a useless
cliché often have issues of their
own that they haven’t dealt with.
Truth is, they seem to be more
interested in being “morally
superior” than in being truly
righteous; as far as I’m con-
cerned, that's a far greater sin
that homosexuality.

And what are the results of
such an overemphasis? Well, we
seem to think that there is some
kind of conspiracy against soci-
ety by gays, what with ﬁlms like
“The Gay Agenda” having come
out in the past couple of years. A
number of us are convinced that

homosexuals are always on the
prowl, trying to seduce little chil-
dren into that lifestyle and that
they want “special rights” that no
one else has. 7

We are willing to lie about
them — one example was a
radio commentary by the Family
Research Council’s Gary Bauer,
a blatant homophobe, against a
man who wanted to apply for
political asylum in this country,
supposedly’ because he was gay
and “being discriminated
against.” (Bauer didn’t mention
that his very life was in danger in
his own country BECAUSE he
was gay.) And there was the true
story about an 18-year-old kid
who was kicked out of his house
upon “coming out” to his father,
while his drug-addicted older
brother was allowed to stay. Is it
any wonder why some gay
groups have become militant,
especially against religion?

That may have been the reason
that then-Phoenix co-publisher
Patrick Mooney got into such hot
water at Carnegie-Mellon
University last spring. Whether
he had the right to rip down a
poster he found to be offensive
to his Roman Catholic faith or to
refuse to wear a “pro-gay” but-
ton — which cost him his job as
a resident assistant — had
become beside the point; any
number of religious people and
institutions have become so
obsessed with stopping “gay
rights” that they’re now alienat-
ing the community at large. Call
it “political correctness” if you
must, but tl1at’s what things have
come to these days. As I’ve said
earlier, I don’t believe in homo-
sexuality, but I don’t treat gays
any differently than I would any-
one else. They are entitled to the
same respect and dignity as you
or I, so it’s time those of us who
are religious humbly recall that
“there but for the grace of God
go I.’’ And then we’ll be free to
“love the sinner.”

decided he
couldn’t
swim with the
big ﬁsh.

In the past,
Lenard would
have drowned and ﬂoated off
to the Continental Basketball
League or across the sea to
Europe. But now, after a new
NCAA rule passed in January,
he has the option to doggie-
paddle back to shore within 30
days.

The 6-foot-4 inch shooting
guard harbored his success at
the University of Minnesota
for three years before he opted
to go pro at the end of his
junior year. With lofty first
round thoughts in the 1994
draft, Lenard jumped boat; but
before he could come up for
air he was the 46th overall pick
by the Milwaukee Bucks, the
19th selection in the second
round.

Disappointed with his posi-
tion, Lenard returned to
Minnesota to complete his
senior year.

Once again the collegiate
basketball players are being
catered to. I guess $70 million
contracts aren’t enough reward
for being able to dribble, shoot
and dunk. If they want to
leave, ﬁne. But they shouldn’t
come groveling back to col-
lege when the NBA spits them
out. It’s their fault —— the big
bucks blinded them and they
want to cash in now.

Buoys are there for a reason:
cross at your own risk. In the
past, several swam past the
buoys and never returned ——
like the multi-talented UNLV
junior guard Anderson Hunt or

Ryan in for true test against Hurricanes

Jim Miadl/Staff Phetegifapher

John Ryan is being chased by Warren Sapp last year.

“John Ryan deserves more
credit than anyone else in this
organization because of what
he’s done,” coach John Majors
said. “He never lost confi-
dence in himself.”

It’s hard to believe that Ryan
had any confidence left after
what he went through“ last sea-
son.'Ryan threw more inter-
ceptions than touchdowns, and
the Panthers were a dismal 3-
8. People saw his stats and
wrote him off. He received
more of a slap in the face

when Fitzgerald was brought
in to take his job.

“He took a pounding both on
and off the field last year,”
center Lawson Mollica said.
“What people didn’t realize is
that we didn’t have a strong
supporting cast last year.”

Ryan ended last year as the
No. 1 quarterback but received
a rude awakening when the
job was wide open in camp.

“I improved almost every-
thing in spring camp,” Ryan
said. “I was kind of shocked

anything to lose it.”

He ended up losing the job,
but to his credit, he took the
demotion like a professional.

“It really didn’t hit me until
the first game of the year when
you see another quarterback
out there” he said. “You know
what you can do, but you’re
not given the chance.”

In fact, it bothered Ryan so
much that he briefly enter-
tained the thought of leaving.
But to his credit, he didn’t let
his disappointment show in the
field.

p “I just went out there and
practiced,” he said. “I don’t
think that I gave the attitude to
anybody that I had given up. I
was frustrated, but I tried not
showing it to anybody else.”

And as Ryan waited,
Fitzgerald was ineffective and
unable to move the team.

When Ryan was given his
chance, he made the most of it.

This week, he will face his
toughest test of the season.

The Miami defense is the
best in the nation. The
Panthers are averaging 386
yards a game_in total offense.
They will be hard pressed to
reach this mark against a
Hurricane defense that is only
allowing 218 yards a game.

Fifth Column, amongst the found-
ing mothers of the Riot Grrrl explosion
of the past few years, and_ Louisville lit-
tle strummer boys the Palace Brothers
have about as much in common as
Hillary Clinton and Mickey Rourke.
While the Toronto dyke-punks who
comprise Fifth Column run around
making ‘zines, films and generally
shouting about the situation of les-
bians, particularly, and women, gener-
ally, the Palace Brothers are stuck in a
truck stop that’s all out of diesel  and
bourbon.

Seems like the perfect show already,
but once we tip the scale in the sexual-
ly atheistic direction with London riot
kids Huggy Bear, we have a truly com-
pelling evening of fine entertainment.

Palace Brothers started out a couple
years back, hoedownin’ it with founder
Will Oldham and a few rhythm lads
from local superheroes of indie rock,
Slint. Known (at least amongst certain
circles) as having a reputation for play-
ing brilliant post-country jams, as well
as for skipping shows, breaking up,
etc., the Palace Bros. called it quits last
year to leave Will on his own, sitting in
a bar somewhere writing songs.

Now, after a single as Palace Songs,
a new album on the legendary Drag
City label (see Royal Trux) and a sec-
ond stage tour with (gasp!)
Lollapalooza (including Pittsburgh,
catch ‘em?), Billy and the Boys are
hopping in the van again to deliver the
spirit of Hank Williams back to us. With
his band of thieves, or on his own,
Palace can be relied upon to give us
110-proof music which knows not the
bounds of indie and rock. To find the
Palace secrets, one must dig deep
through Bob Dylan’s sinful past, and
find the sadness and anger rooted in

through un-Slinted eyes to the lone- ‘

some fields Jim Beam harvested. One
must hear it to believe it. American
music, dammit.

Fifth Column singer Caroline Azar
claimed in an interview that, while the
band actually kicked off in ‘83, Fifth
Column truly started in 1927, along
with country music archetypes the
Carter Family: ‘‘If you’re white, the
Carter Family is part of your DNA.”

, Oddly enough, that's where Fifth

Column and Palace Brothers compar-
isons basically end.

G.B. Jones, the band’s guitarist, is a
much-lauded filmmaker (see No Skin
Off My Ass for acting and Yo-Yo Gang
for directing), artist (the Tom-Girls; car-
toonish lesbian biker drawings) and
‘zine creator (J.D.’s, one of the first
Homo-core ‘zines, and the more recent
Double Bill, which centers on deflating
the bullshit of the gay scene, with
genius writer extraordinaire William S.
Burroughs as her public enemy num-
ber one). Donna Dresch, Olympia,
Wash.’s queer-punk queen, just came
through town with Team Dresch, and
singer Azar and bassist Beverly von
Brucker each wear their own political
and artistic “many hats” as well.

Mostly, however, Fifth Column is
about women playing hard, Ramones-
inspired, punk rawkus with pro-woman,
pro-dyke lyrics, such as “She’s got a
gun, she’s got a knife, she’s got some
scissors, she’s got a life,” from “All
Women are Bitches,” lead-off track on
their new K Records LP, 36C. (Yes, the
title is what you think.)

Huggy Bear fall into the Riot Grrrl
thing themselves. They rock, they don’t
complain too much (Is that good? is

that Bad?), or at least not as loudly,
and they're English. What does that
mean? lt’s the “Kids are Kissing Again”
revolution, of course! They sound like,
in their own words, “A 20th century
misplaced invasion fighting the indie
rock world in a civil revolt; proud and
proper manners exploding cocktails
into the blues punk rock implosion.
More fun than you ever imagined.”
That sounds fine to me, as long as they
still have icy rabies froth pouring out of
their Hello Kitten mouths, I'm sure
they’ll be enjoyed by myn and womyn
alike. Their new LP, on Kill Rock Stars,

 cylinders of silence. A way to tune into

At first glance, the Eye of Horus,
1305 E. Carson St., looks like a typical
bookshop lined with hardwood floors
and sturdy book shelves. Well, it ain't.
The off-beat texts and subversive
books are over-shadowed by a man-

the synchro-energizer. Go ahead, buzz

tools, but prepare to lay down your
cash because it is going to cost you to
whip those brain cells into shape.

“We want the Eye of Horus to be the

and you have got your basic sensory

 

ence total relaxation. As the name
implies, once you are in this gem, you
are shut off from any outside stimuli.
My past experiences with a deprivation
tank have been mind warping to say
the least. Once engulfed by these
futuristic looking wombs, the world gets
sucked down the drain, and every care
or problem is riding piggyback. Even
moving my hands took on a whole new
experience. Shrouded in nothingness,
they became useless conduits of flow-
ing blood and tissue.

Being in this sort of environment
allows you to explore your mind with no
interruptions. Once fully relaxed, I
could hear my heart pounding like a
cement truck rumbling down a bumpy
road. Concentrating on this rhythm, my
mind turned into an elevator, taking me
to some seriously uncharted mental
waters. Have you ever just thought
about colors? I did. This sort of thing
happens when you float around in a
tank all by yourself.

Thoughts blurred into action as my
mind started to travel to higher levels of
consciousness. It traveled so hard that,
if I did not have a skull, my mind might
have flown right out of the tank. This is
when meditation entered Olympic-like
levels. For one of the few moments in
my life, I felt bionic-strong in mind,
body and soul. With my brain waves
revving at 10,000 RPM, I probably
could have bent a spoon with mere
thought alone. Talk about a rush, and I

music, which emerged in the 1940s as
a fusion of Southern folk music, jazz
and swing, High Lonesome offers more
than 100 musical recordings to go
along with interviews, performances,
photographs and archrival footage.
The film traces the bluegrass legacy
via Bill Monroe, Ralph Stanley, Mac

I Don ’t Hate Las Vegas Anymore
Directed by Caveh Zahedi

A film that opens with its director
directly addressing the camera, “This
film is an experiment in faith, an
attempt to prove the existence of God,”
should surely give audiences high
expectations. His premise is that, if
God is all powerful, thenshe/he will
see to it that the unscripted, underfund-
ed film will be entertaining and fulfill
those expectations. When it appears
that no miracle or sign from chief is
coming, Zahedi tries to convince his
father and brother to take the drug
ecstasy with him in an effort to salvage

The Last Words

Directed by Scott Saunders

Natrona Heights native and CMU grad-
uate Michael Kaniecki not only stars in
Scott Saunders first feature film, but he
also co-wrote the screenplay and wrote
and performed most of the soundtrack.
Kaniecki plays Charles, an underem-
ployed singer/songwriter/videotape edi-
tor who hopes that videotaping his life
and his relationships will help him
understand them. The film was shot on
hi-8 video, transferred to film and has
that “no budget” feel and appeal.

Dog Man Star
London Suede
Nude/Columbia

British glam-rock has a cer-
tain charm about it that has
been heating up the frigid
streets of London and inflam-
ing the already feverish dance
clubs in the states. The
London Suede (formerly
known as Suede) came out
with their first self-titled album
in ‘93. The group’s music
spread like a plague. Brett
Anderson, the androgynous,
slutty and narcissistic lead
singer brought a new feisti-
ness to British rock that is not
only intoxicating but also
addictive. Brett Anderson has
this provocatively melodra-
matic voice that can invoke
sexual desire in men, women
and some animals. If you
haven't heard of them, l’m
sure you've heard of songs
from their first album such as
“Animal Nitrate,” “Metal
Mickey" and of course

R “Drowners,” which should be

the teen-sex rock anthem of
the nineties. Their sound is’

fast, frisky and fierce, and I
love it.

Once again, another one of
my favorite bands has decid-
ed to change its sound com-
pletely. This time, fortunately,
it’s a change for the better.
Dog Man Star has a more
obedient sound in comparison
to the first album, -Suede.
Anderson and Bernard Butler
are remarkable songwriters;
The lyrics are “like buttuh!"
Dog Man Star is a perfect
album, save for one or two
songs. “We Are the Pigs” is a
little too repetitious, and “Still
Life" sounds like a soap opera
theme song. But other than
that, the album is great.

Some of the high|ights.are
“|ntroducing the Band," which
has a wonderfully snobbish,
processional sound. The liquid
lyrics drip from Anderson’s
lips and sizzle into an elec-
tronic mix. in “Black or Blue,”
he sings about love, loss and
fate. He does it in such a deli-
cately fluid way that you think
he’s crying. Brett has this
futuristic tunnel voice set to
these fierce string instruments

in “Daddy's Speeding” that are
definitely the brainchild of
Bernard Butler's marvelous
knack for songwriting. “The 2
of Us” is beautiful and sooth-
ing. it’s the kind of song you
listen to when you feel like
killing yourself over some idiot.
Brett's voice varies from alto to
sissy in such an abrupt way
that you forget it's the same
singer.

Brett Anderson has the abili-
ty to go both ways musically
as well as sexually. In the past
year, London Suede has gone
from dynamically ruthless and
intense to slow, mellow and
serious. Yet they still maintain
their glamorous sound ‘and my
ardent admiration. Dog Man
Star is one those albums you'll
want to keep close to the

God Don't Make No Junk
The Halo Benders
K Records

In contention with only
Thurston Moore, Calvin
Johnson is arguably the
Godfather of indie rock. in

addition to being the founder
of K Records, Beat Happening
and Dub Narcotic studios, he
is now a proud member of The
Halo Benders, the latest Io-fi
project from K.

The Halo Benders is really
the baby of Doug Marsch of
Built to Spill, who originally
was only looking for someone
to sing songs and play with
him. Although Johnson actual-
ly ended up writing a good part
of the album's lyrics, as usual
his voice is what distinguishes
him from the latest hodge-
podge of would-be vocalists.

The first mistake I made in
trying to target the band's
sound on God Don't Make No
Junk was that I called what
Marsch and Johnson were
doing a duet. Multiple listens
later, I've determined that they
are merely singing at the same
time. Marsch takes the high
road, and Johnson remains
king of the low, low, low road.
it doesn't mesh too well, but
Johnson has never really been
one for blending. While this
may sound like you’d rather
listen to a 2-year-old play the
pots and pans, it’s actually

NOVEMBER 10 1994

pretty melodic if you're into
semi-euphony.

Beat Happening fans should
not expect a remake of “lndian
Summer" or “Black Candy.”
The songs are still pretty sim-
ple, but the difference lies in
the approach to the music.
The Halo Benders surprised
me with their relatively hard-
hitting, guitar-driven garage
rock. This is particularly evi-
dent on “Canned Oxygen" and
“On a Trip,” which made me
dance around. Check out “Will
Work for Food,” “Freedom
Ride" and “Sit on It.'' Also pay
attention to “Don't Touch my
Bikini" unless you want to miss
Calvin Johnson pioneer the
merge of steadfast indie and
rap.

Recorded in only 10 days on
an eight-track board, The Halo
Benders have pounded out a
delightful 30 minutes of Calvin
Johnson's version of rock ‘n’
roll. Chalk up another point on
the indie rockboard as you
frolic in the basement-punk
happiness that is God Don't
Make No Junk.

Brother Love: Murder,
Money and a Messiah

by Sydney P. Freedberg
Pantheon Books. $24.00

The investigative journalism
of today is equated mostly
with the flashy, slick television
programs that feature celebrity
problems and Midwestern dis-
asters. We, as viewers, can no
longer always rely on televi-
sion news as truth, for the
truth is often masqueraded as
entertainment. The same can
be said for Sydney
Freedberg’s book, Brother
Love. This work chronicles the
life of a religious leader from
Miami, Yahweh Ben Yahweh,
through his beginnings in rural
Oklahoma to his arrest involv-
ing charges of racketeering
and accessory to murder.
Brother Love leaves no stone
unturned, a book so well
researched that there is no
part of this man’s life we do
not see into. Yet several prob-
lems arise in the book involv-
ing the never-ending slick
reporting and the author's
reluctance to go any farther
than the simple facts.

Born Hulon Mitchell Jr., we
see a man grow up through
various religions — from
Holiness Pentecostal church
in Oklahoma where his father
preached; to Atlanta where he
became Hulon X, a minister in
the Nation of Islam; to Miami
and the Temple of Love, a
Hebrew sect that Mitchell -
known first as Brother Love

and later as Yahweh Ben
Yahweh — founded and made
into a multi-million dollar enter-
prise. Through the work of his

many followers, called
Yahwehs, he became one of
the richest black businessmen
in Florida. In Miami, Yahweh
preached that the members of
the black race were the cho-
sen ones written about in the
Bible, not the Jews, and that
he alone could bring his race
to the promised land. His
dreams and goals, though,
were not all sacred. Acts of
sexual infidelity with young
girls, murders of sect mem-
bers who tried to leave the
Temple and a wealth into the
millions that was left unac-
counted for surrounded his
secular life. ‘

In 1992, Yahweh Ben
Yahweh was convicted of
numerous crimes and impris-
oned. The story is an interest-
ing, if not familiar, one. David
Koresh‘ in Texas and the
recent mass deaths in Quebec
and Europe of cult members
show that this is all too com-
mon an occurrence. Yet, it
seems that in every place that
Freedberg could look into the
reasons behind Yahweh’s
popularity, and" the reasons
how he could lead so many
people to do hateful things,
she merely states the facts.

Like the television shows
that discussed and dissected
the Waco debacle for weeks,
Freedberg writes mostly of the
killing and personal sacrifice

Let's start at Luciano’s, across
from Duquesne University on
Forbes Avenue.

My smokes were within
reach, and l was ready for the
Susquehanna Hat Company
to come and burn the stage
down.

David White, one of the two
directors of this local improv
group which formed last May,
leaped on stage kicking off an
hour of insanity.

It was cool because the
company sat in the audience,
which made me feel more
comfortable, more willing to
participate. The fact that the
only chairs were where we
were sitting didn't make a dif-
ference.

Okay, let me get on with
this. The company did about
five or six games but didn't
include audience members as
much as I would have liked. I
was willing to jump in, but
they were obviously some-
what rehearsed sketches.
Flehearsed in the sense that
the members were needed for
the sketches, so I couldn’t
participate, which is what I
wanted to do.

I guess it comes down to
the fact that I’m not in the
company. Oneof my favorite
sketches was a talk show
about “The Women Who Love
Women and the Men Who
Love Them,” which was unbe-
lievably funny.

Now, the Unseam’d
Shakespeare Company is
putting up Duchess of Malfi
by John Webster, which isn't
so funny. The play is a
Jacobean melodrama first pro-
duced in 1613.

“A widowed duchess
(Barbara Williams) falls in love
with her steward (Scott
Ferrara) but has to hide the
relationship from her tyranni-
cal brothers (Dereck Walton
and Scott Thewes), who
respond lethally when they
learn of her deception,” sung
director David White out a
16th floor window of the
Cathedral.

did not have to break any laws
to feel this way. Sensations
and experiences felt in the
tank are different for everyone,
according to Buckley. You
could swirl off into another
dimension, as I did, or remem-
ber that you forgot to turn the
television off.

If you do not want to get wet,
take your clothes off or bend
silverware with your brain
waves, the Eye of Horus has a
synchro—energizer that fetches
10 dollars for 20 minutes. A
pair of eye glasses, with circu-
lar lights in place of the lenses,
are worn with a set of head
phones. Massaging your brain,
a wash of blips and rough stat-
ic are choreographed to strob-
ing lights by a black control
box. The noise and light show
is an attempt to synchronize
the Alpha, Beta and other.
waves that radiate from your
boney cranium.

With the glasses strapped on
my face and the earphones all

in page 4

plugged in, I sat back in a
rocking chair, nervously coax-
ing the synchro—energizer to do
its thing. A trickle of sweat
snaked down my forehead,
then BLAM, a blitzkrieg of fire-
works shot off in my mind's
eye. Swatches of blue tangoed
with flaming red and then melt-
ed into twists of dazzling pur-
ple. After five minutes, the
lights became so lush and
vivid that my brain turned into
a hyperbolic racing machine
ready to eat large strips of
asphalt at the drop of a flag.
When my 20 minutes were
up, I was ready for another
hour. The extravaganza of
lights and blips soothed my
soul. I felt calm and in control
for at least 45 minutes after the
session. Bob Weir, musician
for the Grateful Dead, endors-
es the synchro—energizer on
some sales literature saying,
“Guaranteed to change your
state of mind.” Weir must need
a rest from his acid-dropping

days and has sought after a
safer high. No flashbacks here,
just a menage of jumping
color.

A take home version of the
synchro—energizer is available
in the form of the Day
Dreamer. A favorite at this
year's Lollapalooza, the Day
Dreamer is a mask-like toy
with reflective spinning disks
over the eye openings. When
you close your eyes and face
the sun, you blow into a tube
that makes the discs spin. A
throbbing strobe effect, like the
one generated by the synchro-
energizer, hammers on your
retina. Tap, tap, tap — a per-
sonally-induced, psychedelic
utopia can be yours for $15.00.

Here is where reality takes a
header into the dream world.
Under a glass counter in Horus
sits the lucid dream machine.
The name of this setup
appears to be a paradox.

are aware that you are dream-
ing, but are not conscious of
reality. Once you reach lucidity
in your dreams, you can then
control them as if they were
happening in real life. A lucid
dream machine consists of a
night mask, with a computer
controlled brain wave sensor.
It is supposed to alert a sleep-
er of the REM stages of sleep
which are associated with
dreaming. A little red light
appears behind the closed
eyelid of a sleeper, gently
telling him or her that the sand
man is sending a dream.
Stephen LaBerge, a psy-
chophysiologist, is a pioneer
and promoter of lucid dream-
ing. He has been researching
dreams and developing lucid
dream machines since the
Sixties. He told Omni maga-
zine that he dabbled with psy-
chedelic drugs to open himself
to an inner world. In 1968, he
lost funding from NASA and
other sources where he ‘con-

cocted hallucinogenic drugs to
unveil the mind’s landscape.
Still wanting to probe the
brain, LaBerge refocused his
research into lucid dreaming.
He and his fellow lucid dream-
ers call themselves “oneiro-
nauts,” a neologism from the
Greek words for dream and
explorer according to Omni.

Is it possible that these
machines could make people
lose their ability to discrimi-
nate the dream world from
reality? Omni reported that a
psychologist ‘ from the
University of West of England,
Susan Blackmore, has
become concerned with such
anecdotal reports. Of course,
LaBerge feels the opposite,
believing rather that lucid
dreaming helps one distin-
guish reality from the dream
world. You be the judge. Two
hundred and fifty bucks, a lot
of practice and a hell of an
imagination is all it takes.

Sensory deprivation tanks,
synchro-energizers and lucid
dream machines have chis-
eled a niche in our drug cul-
ture which has erupted into a
seething form of cyber-dope.
Pittsburgh has a new way to
get doped up. it promises a
sanitary high free of bad trips,
disease and under-cover
pushers. People hooked on
this shit will only worry about
pruned-up skin from soaking
in a tank all day or heavy cir-
cles under their eyes from
synchro-energizing too long.
Could the days of owning a
bong crammed with weed be
replaced by a lucid dream
machine hooked up to every
bed in America?

Back in the Sixties, kids
dropped acid and smoked
intense amounts of weed to
rebel against their parents or
to find their inner-selves. In

the ‘90s, kids still want to get
high, but they know »it’s not

Besides offering a clean

_ Guelwaar (Senegal)
Directed by Ousmane
Sembene

Third Cinema stalwart and

 

done for one man s words. In
the book, murder is not only
written of., but graphically
described. Pain and suffering
are glamorized. It becomes a
slick package of facts, hardly
touching what really seems to
matter in situations such as
this — the effects on the indi-
viduals. Insights are side-
stepped, it is journalism that
stays off the editorial page,
which is the major flaw with
Brother Love. The race issue
is reduced to the chosen peo-
ple vs. the “White devils,” and
the psychology behind the
man is never fully discussed.

With the way Freedberg
relays the information, with her
sources clearly stated, and the
easy, fiction-like writing, it is
hard for me to say that the
book wasn't interesting. But
stating the facts can only go
so far, and the reasons behind
the bizarre actions are never
spelled out in the book.

- Raphe Cheli

returns with a trenchant comic
portrait centering on the mys-
terious death and disappear-
ance of Guelwaar, political
activist, philandering patriarch

Sembene combines black
comedy, political allegory,
social satire and family drama
to examine the internal prob-
lems of modern Africa.

scoreless

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The dominating Miami
defensive unit is cooked and
loaded and has its sights set
on the Panthers in a Big East
Conference matchup
Saturday afternoon in the
Orange Bowl.

This season the Hurricane
defense has all but destroyed
its opponents’ offenses.
Miami is holding its oppo-
nents to a paltry 218.8 yards
per game.

The defense has given up

I l 2 9 . 4

' passing
and 89.4

MIAMI yards

p e r
game rushing. Opponents are
averaging only 10.8 points
per game against Miami.
Miami leads the Big East in
each of these categories.

“We are playing really well
on defense,” Miami head
coach Dennis Erickson said.
“That’s been the key to our
success this year.”

This year they have held
Florida State, West Virginia
and Virginia Tech each to
under 50 yards total rushing.

Hurricane opponents have
not done much more through
the air. .

The ‘Canes have allowed
just four pass plays over 30
yards all season, and just one
over 37 yards in length.

In its last three games, the
Miami defense has held
opponents to 6—of-38 (.158)
on third-down conversions.
On the season, Hurricane
opponents have converted
36-of-121 third-down
attempts (.298).

“We have just been able to
keep people out of the end
zone,” Erickson said. “We

After being rejected by Pitt
in 1989, Chris T. Jones has
emerged as Miami’s most
consistent receiver.

Going into this weekend’s
contest with the Panthers, the
6-foot-4-inch, 210-pound
senior has caught at least one
pass in each of the last 23
games, which is the longest
current streak for the
Hurricanes.

“Chris is leading receiver

A and has made a lot of great

plays for us,” Miami coach
Dennis Erickson said. “He is
our go-to guy. We try to get
the football to him on third
downs.”

The native of West Palm
Beach, Fla. leads his team in
every receiving category this
season.

In eight games, Jones has
caught 27 passes for 468
yards,

He averages 17.3 yards a

reception to go along with
his five touchdowns.

Erickerson said Jones’ per-
formance on the field is an
example of his pride for
Miami.

I guess you can say
Miami’s gain is Pitt’s loss,
because Jones, who contin-
ues the tradition of great
Miami receivers, always
wanted to be a Panther.

C.T. Jones: A receiver u|dn't catch

As a teenager, Jones’ bed-
room walls were decorated
with the Panther blue and
gold. ‘

While his friends told sto-
ries of Jerome Brown,
Bennie Blades and Vinny
Testaverde, he talked about
Tony Dorsett, Dan Marino
and Hugh Greene.

During his senior season at
Cardinal Newman High
School, Jones, who was
regarded as an all-state and
Super 24 receiver while
catching 73 passes for 1,089
yards and nine touchdowns,
didn’t even want to talk to
scouts if they were not from
Pitt.

But according to Pitt,
Jones’ grades were -not good
enough. Even though he
scored higher than a 700 on
his SATs and achieved better
than a 2.0 in his core courses
in high school, Pitt said he
didn’t belong.

That's when he opted stay

lar,” Majors said. “We’re play-

ing one of the best teams in

the country.”
The trademark of the Miami

' defense is blazing speed. The

Hurricanes are one of the
fastest teams in the country.
Running against the ‘Canes is
exceedingly difficult because
their linemen are as fast as
many halfbacks. Passing is
also a problem when the
defensive backs are some of
the fastest players in the
nation.

“You have to run right at
them,” Ryan said. “You have
to run wide, and you can’t
throw deep outs. Their speed
is unreal along with almost
every other aspect of their
defense. We just have to
adjust.”

The Panthers will have to
make a number of adjustments
if they plan on putting up the
kind of offensive numbers that
they have generated in the last
few weeks. Coming home
from the Orange Bowl with a
win over the ‘Canes and their
vaunted defense would be the
equivalent of winning a bowl
game.

“We can’t go in there
scared,” Ryan said. “We can’t
get caught up thinking about
their defense. We just have to
go out there and follow our

game plan. Hopefully, it’s’

good enough to get us a win.”

at home and learn the
Hurricanes’ offense,
redshirting in 1990.

With one year of
learning under his belt,
Jones earned a varsity
letter as a reserve. He
appeared in 10 games
and made eight recep-
tions for 125 yards.

His highlight of the
season came against
San Diego State, as he
caught a 53 yarder
against the Aztecs.

The next year, he
earned his second varsi-
ty letter, while snagging
13 receptions for 151
yards.

But last season was
his coming-out party.
Starting in all 12
games, he seemed to get
better as the weeks
went by.

Jones emerged into a
first-team All-Big East
performer, while lead-
ing the team in recep-

tions (45), yards (700) I
and average per catch r
(15.6). He was second .
on the team with four _.

touchdowns.
Against Florida State,

Jones earned ABC-TV’s i
Most Valuable Player 

award for his efforts.
He caught seven catch-
es for 86 yards in the
game.

Jones came into this
season as part of The
Sporting News presea-
son first team All-Big

‘East. His hard work in

the weight room is
among the best on
Miami’s receiving
corps, with a 385-pound
squat, _a 280—pound

power clean and a 325- .

pound bench press.

Due to his hard work
over the years, his
teammates selected him
as one of three captains

Sapp

°From page 6
take advantage of the oppor-
tunities that are presented to
you.”

Sapp, a preseason All-
American and finalist for the
Lombardi award, is already
being predicted as a top five
first round pick in the
National Football League, an
honor he appreciates, but
realizes is just that -— a pre-
diction.

“I’ve seen people go from
preseason All-American to
almost a nobody, not even
known at their own house at
lunchtime,” Sapp said. “It’s
nice to see my name in the
magazines, see that people
hold me in high regards for
my football talents. But it
doesn’t do anything to me
because pressure is only what
you put on yourself, and I
demand everything of myself
everyday.”

There has been a lot of
speculation that Sapp, cur-
rently a junior, will leave
Miami after this season for
the NFL, but Sapp has
remained firm in his state-
ment that he intends to stay at
UM. He said his only goal
right now is to help the
Hurricanes win a national

‘ championship, and that is

where all of his effort is
going right now.

Sapp spends hours each day
in the weight room and can
squat over 550 pounds and

bench press 385 pounds. His
work ethic is something Sapp
thinks rubs off on his team-
mates, making everyone work
harder. He said working hard
is just his style of football,
and if it makes his teammates
work harder, then he has done
his job.

“If working hard is being a
leader, then that’s being a
leader,” he said. “When they
see you working hard, they

want to work hard, and that

makes me want to work even
harder. Hard work is conta-
gious. We’re trying to make it
a track meet to the quarter-
back.”

“He just goes 110 percent
every play,” graduate assis-
tant Greg Mark said. “He’s
not just running around obliv-
ious, he knows what [the
opponent] is doing blocking
scheme-wise to him. I can’t
explain how helpful that is.”

The one thing Sapp does
not do is taunt the opposition.
He feels it gives them moti-
vation and encouragement to
play harder. He said everyone
knows when someone makes
a good play, so why make a
big scene of it. He celebrates
with his teammates but has
made it a custom not to get
into opponents’ faces.

That is something different
than past Hurricanes football
players who have created a
negative image about the
team. Miami has been por-

trayed in the past as a team
full of arrogant, 1oud—mouth
players, an image Sapp feels
the team has done a good job
of changing.

“The way you demoralize a
runner is you hit, you swarm,
you bring all 11,” Sapp said.
“You get seven, eight people
hitting him, and he won’t
want the ball anymore. You
conventionally beat them
every play, and let your
actions speak louder than
words.”

The side of Sapp that can’t
be hidden is his outgoing
nature. He can constantly be
seen spraying teammates with
water hoses or teasing the
cornerbacks after beating
them in sprints. He carries
that attitude onto the field,
always trying to keep the
game fun.

“Just the way he plays, you
can’t help but get excited,”
Mark said. “He makes me
want to put on a helmet and
get back in there. It’s some-
thing he carries with him and
is very prevalent and carries
over to the whole defense.”

Sapp’s attitude, along with
his dominating play, has
drawn- praise from both
coaches and teammates.

Ray Lewis, who leads
Miami with 113 tackles, gave
most of the credit to Sapp
after compiling 17 tackles,
four pass breakups, half a
sack and interception against

Virginia Tech two weeks ago.

“When I have Warren Sapp
in front of me, I can do'any-
thing,” Lewis said. “He
makes my job easy.”

Most analysts and coaches
have called Sapp the best
defensive lineman in action,
and Hurricane coach Dennis
Erickson agrees.

“If there’s a better defen-
sive lineman in college foot-
ball, I’d like to see him,”
Erickson said. “He just goes
out and plays well every
game.”

Being a Miami Hurricane is
part of Warren Sapp. As a
tight end in high school, he
was heavily recruited by
many major universities, but
said he had always intended
to play for UM.

“I was coming here the
whole time,” Sapp said. “All
I needed was my mother’s
approval, and when I brought
her here and she said she
liked it, I said OK.”

But that didn’t stop him
from taking the free trips
offered to him by other
schools for him to come see
their campuses.

“I had never seen snow, so I
went to Michigan State,”
Sapp said. “I rolled around in
that for two days, got sick of
it and came back. Florida
State? Nah! And that other
place up there [Florida], I
can’t even get my mouth to
say that place.”

And this is where the minor
stipulation lies for the ﬂeet-
footed players eager to bail.
Claxton and Lenard are bound
to the original teams that draft-
ed them. What’s better, they are
paid second-round money,
which usually means the
league minimum of $150,000.

This is a big ‘blow to Lenard.
If he stayed one more year,
then he would have been an
easy lottery pick in ‘95 with a
king’s contract. Instead, he is
drowning in the waves he
waked.

In the NBA’s narrow sea,

GVERNMENT

Joining Sapp on the defen-
sive line are senior Pat
Riley, sophomore Kenny
Holmes and surprise fresh-
man Kenard Lang. Lang has
30 tackles, eight sacks for a
loss of 64 yards and 14 quar-
terback pressures.

Miami also has a more
than effective defensive sec-
ondary. Leading the hit
parade is senior safety C.J.
Richardson. He was named
Big East Defensive Player of
the Week for his efforts
against Syracuse last week,
which included a team-high
15 tackles. Richardson has
58 tackles (34 solo) on the
season.

At strong safety is senior
Malcolm Pearson, who is
tied for the team lead with
four interceptions.

At cornerback for Miami
is the duo of Carlos Jones
and Chad Wilson. Jones has
four interceptions with one
returned for a touchdown,
and Wilson has two picks.

“Everybody’s executing
their assignments,” Erickson
said. “There’s a lot of guys
making big plays on
defense.”

This season’s edition of
the Miami defense has
equalled the great defenses
that have christened the
Orange Bowl. The Hurricane
defense has recorded 109
shutouts in their 69-year his-
tory, and Pitt is one of its
most common victims, being
shutout four times. After
shutting out Georgia
Southern in this season’s
opener, the ‘Canes have
recorded at least one shutout
in 52 of their 69 seasons.

“Right now, they’re play-
ing better than any defense
that I’ve had since I’ve been
here,” Erickson said. “Our
defense hasn’t allowed a
touchdown on the road this
season. We haven’t had a
touchdown scored on us in
our league. That’s a pretty
damn good defense.”
