Current Economy Boom——

W h     W ' I I
by JIM HOSEK
There is no question today as to

whether an economic boom is now .

in progress. but how that boom is
going to end has left economists
guessing. '

The U.S. Department of Com-
merce reported that first quarter
corporate profits were up to 26
per cent from a year ago at $62.3
billion, after taxes.

Butas the old sa-ying goes:
“Whatever goes up must also
come down.” ‘ ‘ ‘

Whether thatcurrent boom will
fall drastically to lead ‘into a de-
pression in early 1974 or wh’ether
a smooth transition from boom to

“semi-boom" will take place is

on the minds of many people
across‘ the country. especially
those involved in industry.

Here on the Pitt campus. a few
people from‘ the Department of
Economics do not seem concern-
ed about the possibilities of a 1974
depression or "mini-depression".

Associate Professor in Eco-
nomics Norman Miller said, “Sure
there _will be a drownswing in
the U.S. economy sooner or later,
but to predict when that would
happen would be like trying to
take a. stab in the dark.”

|tLead?i

"I tend to shy away from ana-
lyzing any fluctuati,ons in the eco-
nomy." said David Houston. pro-
fessor in economics,

"Booms and recessions do not
indicate anything about the wel-
fare of the people. They only say
how well.big business is doing."
continued Houston. '

He also claimed that “very few
people today would say that we
are well off living in what is now
call an economic boom—mai_nly
because of inflation.

"I‘m sure that there will be a
recession. but when it will be. I

. don't really‘know, and I do not

think that most people in this
country really care." ._

David Bramhall, professor in
economics. said that he could not
make a “snap judgment“ as to
whether a‘ recession would take
place in‘ the future, but only said.
"The US." definitely is plagued by
a. number of economic problems.
What they will lead to. I'm not
prepared to say."

Miller explained that at the pre-
sent time, contrary, to many prog-,
nosticators, _“the I economic_ sit-
uation does notindicate a reces-
sion.”

Bimbo’s Renovation Planned;

by RITA VITOLO

Several Pitt administrative ol-
ficials at Pitt are in the process
of developing plans to renovate
the University-owned block of
buildings between Bouquet St. and
Oakland Ave.
"The remodeled buildings will
eventually house such student or-
ganizationsas the Black Studies
Office. the General Studies Of-
fice. the Graduate and Profession-
al Students Association. and the
International Students Associa-
tion. ’ _

According to Dan Meloro of the
Office of Student Activities, the

buildings might also serve as a

meeting house for some of the"

black fraternities and sororities
on campus, as well as housing the
coffee shop on weekends. It may
operate as an on-campus commu-
ter center by day. A

One proposal suggested the

creation of a BYOB. over 21 club}

within the old Bimbo's building.
However. these plans are still un-
der review bythe participating
student organizations.

Although Meloro expects "at
least minimal renovations" to be
completed by Sept. 1: the entire
project is is being held up on

Baker, 1973 Polaris editor.

I Bouvier»S,peaks On Budget Cuts

by RITA VITOLO ’

"A university has a responsi-
bility to function as well as it can
within the given system; I don't
feel Pitt is fulfilling that respon-
sibility. And the studentsare the
ones getting screwed." said Pe-

. ter Bouvier. an ex-staff associate

for research and planning in the
Office of Student Affairs. ‘
Ostensibly. Bouvier was fired as
as part. of the six per cent cut in
progr’a’m financing required of
every department within the Uni-
versity in order to meet" the over-
all fiscal budget for 1973. _
Acknowledging that ' his job
held relatively little practical sig-
nificance, and was a valid target
for budget-trimming," Bouvier
charged Pitt’s top administrators,

“the Chancellor and his Vice-i

chancellors” with incompetence
in not forseeing this budget crisis,
despite past budget crises at Pitt.

"This same thing.happened in
California in'1968. has been hap-

’ pening on campuses throughout

the nation. Are the administra-
tors here so naive as to believe
that it wouldn‘t happen at Pitt?"
asks Bouvier.

Bouvier suggested that one way

to prevent future financial crises ..

at Pitt was to institute selective
budget cutting and better pro-
gram planning. Heparticularly
felt that the largeamounts re-

~ cenitly spent to bring "a' major

change inifootba-ll" toP.-itt were

 

“Urban college football,” Bou_-
vier claims, “is on a decline na-
tionwide, yet Pitt spends thou-
sands of dollars" on its football
team—money that would be better
spent in other places, particularly
to offer more scholarships.”

Feeling that the University sys- '

.tem ','brutalized and demoraliz-I

ed" all those associated with it on
a daily basis. Bouvier granted

that it was difficultifor an organ- ,

ization "the "size of a small city”
to avoid. certain" bureaucratic
functions. However. he argued
for a "change in priorities" at
Pitt. V ‘

which includes $300 for travel
expenses which will be incurred
by his staff, mainly from the Phil-

adelphia area, in drawing up the '

magazine here this summer.

Baker, while knowing that this
may be the last issue of the finan-
‘cially-plagued Polaris, wants to
dedicate the magazine to the Class

of ‘77. and State Rep. Martin Mul.-.

lin. However.’ Student Govern-
ment and the_Allocations Com-

-mittee disagree with many of
Baker's throughts concerning the ;

magazine. I.
"When I took the job of editor

, of the 1973 Polaris, I knew that it

would probably be the magazines
last issue. for the magazine has
run in the red for the last" five
years. I want to sabotage it so
that no one will want a Polaris
again." he said.

“By dedicating the Polaris to
Martin Mullin I in no way intend
.to slander or libel anyone.’How-

self, my business manager,- the

In addition, Meloro feels the ex-.»~-11%;

Bella Abzugn (D..' N.\'.i recently attracted attention when she
introduced a resolution in the House of'Representatives calling for

impeachment proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon. lt ’

was the second such resolution brought against Presidentriixon
since his election in 1968.

Dr. Richard Seeburger. professor of constitutional law at Pitt's
Law School. outlined the impeachment process and discussed the
potential outcome in the event of Richard Nixon's impeachment.

According to ‘Dr. Seeburger, “Impeachment is an act, vested
by the people into the Congress and Senate, to remove members of
high government office who have committed high crimes or mis-
demeanors.”

Seeburger explained that the impeachment process begins in
the House of Representatives. when a member submits an impeach-
ment resolution to the floor. '

Then following testimony.t'rom many witnesses. including the_

defendant. the House takes a vote. When a two-thirds majority vote
in favor of impeachment is registered. the resolution then moves to
the floor of the’ Senate. ,

Once_the Senators have voted, the proceedings come to a halt.

A two-thirds yea vote will mean impeachment for the incumben
President, and any vote less returns the defendant to office. V ~

Seeburger went'on to discuss -the legal_.and political impl-i'ca-f
tions of an impeachmentresulting in the termination‘ of office. "Le-p

gally. of course. the Vice-President assumes the role of President’;

in this case meaning Spiro Agnew."

“But then the political implications of impeachment would be‘-
tremendous. It would first create great political stress (within the‘_ _
governmental coalition i, as in the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868." - --

Seeburger continued,’ “Impeachment would also cause a reor- 9
dering of the center of political power in the United States. This-
would not only mean that the power of the office of the President 1‘ 
would be lessened to a state of normal balance, assuming that the -
President now has more power than Congress, but that the power.‘
of the Congress would be increased which would create an opposite ._ I

imbalance of power ‘perhaps more dangerous than the one we now 5

have. -

_ “This imbalance. where the Senate would have tremendous"
influence over the White House. is one that most senators do not 6'

want. and one they wi1l_fight to avoid."

- Seeburger said the most damaging political effects would corne"__ — 

in the area of foreign policy and relations. "In the past. _any~Vice_- ,

President who comes unexpectedly into the office of the President

has had problems with foreign policy."

And in the case “with Agnew as President, foreign relations .
would come to a standstill. Nixon’s overture with China just’ would _

not stick.” '

 Pm Student Hopeful

pol City Council Win

by JIM HOSEK

. _A University student, who last
 ~ week pulled in the top number of
‘ votes in the Republican City Coun-
cil primary, feels his chances for
a November win are "good."
Twenty-four-old Robert Price

said that he is looking for the en-

dorsement and votes from three
._ key areas to be assured of a vic-
_ ’ ltory: the Republicans, blacks and
 youth. ‘ '
V _Price hopes that “the people
" who did not endorse me in the past
primary election don’t feel alien-
 ? ated because I won.” He was re-
_ 0, ferring to thexlack of endorsement
' i from the Republican Party.

,. Although he thinks that endorse-

 sments are helpful, Pricerwants

 ‘,‘people to support me because

 they believe in me and because
I ' they feel that I can win.

_ "I don’t want them voting for
._'me because of party affiliations."
_.,_he~continued.

..He pointed to the re-election of
Mayor Peter Flaherty and his vic-
toriesgin all three major parties,
, wliich__shows “that you don’t have
‘tobe party affiliated to win.”

" '1 f‘I wantpeople to vote for the
’ﬁ man and not the party in Novem-
 ber," said Price. “In fact, [found
that most people running for City
. Council this past primary rep-
resented themselves and not the
‘parties that they were somehow
'- affiliated with."

;He'hopes to crack the Demo-
1' ‘cratic machine's past ability of
 getting the City to'vote straight
 _fa‘long party lines in regard to City
-Council elections by “just getting
out to meet the people to let them
know where you stand.“

Price described his experience

  
 
  
 

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 

in this past election as “valuable
in that meeting people and listen-
ing to all their ideologies is really
great..

"I‘ve learned something from
almost everyone that l’ve spoken
with this year in campaigning."
explained the candidate.

By his possible election in No-
vember, Price wants to “bring
cohesiveness into City govern-
ment.”

Pitt chapter forms

by DEBBIE POPP

The Eastern Regional Conven-
tion of the National Organization
of Women (NOW) will be held
May 25-27 in the William Penn Ho-
tel.

The convention, sponsored by
eight southwestern Pennsylvania
NOW chapters. is designed to
confront the economical. social.
and organizational issues facing
the members of NOW.

Aspects of these issues will be
discussed in three, two-hour ses-
sions Saturday and Sunday. The
sessions will seek answers to
questions such as “Is NOW dis-

couraging feminist, business?”
“What is the unconscious sexism
in NOW?” and “Are Men the ene-
my?”

A secondary purpose of the con-
vention described by Mary Tis-
era. public relations director for
the convention. is to destroy
myths about the NOW organiza-
tion. "We have made a strong ef-
fort to encourage local women and
men to participate and realize the
benefits of the feminist move-
merit."

Keynote speakers on the con-
vention schedule are Wilma Scott
Heide, national president of NOW.

NU-WRO. Organizes Working Class

by MICHAEL CLINTON

The National Unemployed and
Welfare Rights Organization
(NU-WRO) held its first organiza-
tional meeting in Pittsburgh Mon-
day.

According to the organizations
statement of purpose. "NU-WRO
is a team of organizer-fighters for
the just rights of the whole pop-
ulation of unemployed and under-
employed in the USA.“ The state-
ment explains that with the “in-

crease in unemployment, the cap-.

italist ‘class must implement a
fascist re-cycling program to
maintain debt service. resulting
in forced scab labor."

NU-WRO’s_ purpose stresses

that the group “provides a human
alternative by uniting the unem-

joint struggle of unemployed with
employed can‘, the needs of the
working class as a whole be met."
Martha Hilty. one of the initia-
tors of the Pittsburgh faction of

' NU-WRO described her group as a

"socialist movement." She stated
that the "only socialist organiza-
tion to help build and continue to
support NU-WRO is the National
Caucus of Labor Committee
(NCLC).“ ’ -

New Solidarity, the weekly
newspaper of NCLC, covers all of
NU-WRO’s efforts and activities
and has recently written a com-
plete histgry of the NU-WRO
movement.

At Monday's meeting, a mem-
ber\of the New York chapter of
NU-WRO said that the “goals of

played with the employed arogd-/_V,the organization are to develop a

a common interest, resulting in a
self-interest movement for the
working class.”

The statement continues that
only through the “relationship of

national, semi-mass organization
concerned with unemployment.”
He told the audience that it is
“necessary to develop a_ con-
sciousness among workers, in or-

term goal of the NU-WRO move-
ment was a "complete overhaul

He did ‘say, however. that a re-
cession will take place. "but only
after we have full employment.
Then the economy will fall."

Authorities from the US. De-
partment of Commerce indicate
that unemployment will reach a
low by the end of this year (be-
low five per cent, but that it would
rise again above five per cent in
1974).

Therefore, according to Mill-
er’s standards, a recession could
not take place in the near future.

sion.”,

of the people. “ ’

He pointed to a number of eco-
nomic problems which will exist
despite the existence of “a so-call-
ed boom": problems of distribu-
tion of money and inflation, to
name a few.

“These problems,” he said,
“will not go away regardless ‘of
how much the economy booms.”

like to analyze fluctuations in the
economy, the predominating opin-

African liberation week. run-
ning Monday May 19 (Malcolm

May 26. has five purposes. said
Kiburi of the Atrican
Liberation Support Committee.

Financial, material, and moral
support to liberation struggles
fighting European colonial rule
is one of the major goals. Others
include: passing information to
Blacks in diaspora of these strug-
gles and their importance, inform-
ing those on the fighting lines
in Africa_ of the Committee's posi-
tions and need for cultivating re-
lationships, removal of military,
economic, and political support
of the White minority ruled gov-
ernments in southern Africa; and
stressing the participation of
other African nations in the con-
flict.

Last year's African liberation
climax was held in Washington.
D.C.. but to cut costs and enable
larger contributions. the events
will be local this year.

The national objective of the
African Liberation Support Coin-
mittee is to raise and send $40.-
000 to further African indepen-
dance. Pittsburghs contribution
should exceed $691.25. which is
35 of the Pennsylvania require-
ment. and is figured into the na-
tional average and effort.

pathy. for not only the support of
the liberation struggles. but in
the common knowledge that our
fellow black in Africa is fighting
and winning the right to govern
and take his rightful position
among the peoples of the world.
said Kiburi.

May 24, from 7:00 p.m. until
11:01, will be Kuumba (creativity)
night. This, like most of the "ac-
tivities of the week will be held
at The New Hill House Associa-
tion on Center Avenue. Programs
will continue throughout the
week, in the same time period.

May 25 will feature The Sel-
ma Burke,Dancers. who are not-
ed throughout the Black coni-
inunity for their creativity!

The climax of the week will
be May 26. when there will be
a march and rally. The march
will begin at "freedom corner"
(Crawford and Center Ave.»
Assembly time will be 12:30. and
the march will then pi‘oceed
through Downtown to Point State
Park. b

Some of the speakers will be
Mr. Bouie Hayden. Anugo l\'tu-
kogu. Tiga Tita. and Salid Upiii
Salaam.

Some of the other performers
on the program will be The Ma-
Iaika singers and The New World
Drummers. Singer Loretta Wil-
liams will also contribute to the
solidarity climax.

Contributions should be asent

Baker says he is trying to

Student Government questions
the need of the Polaris, because
the Freshman Orientation pro-

tion of the freshman class pic- .

tures.

"And if the pictures arethat
important. there may be a way to
publish them at a much cheaper
cost than publishing the Polaris,’_’

_ said SG member Sue Ruffner. -,

At present, a committee com-
prised of publications members
and Student Government is being
organized to decide whether or
not the Polaris is worth funding.
"We don’t want to cut it. but the
role of the Polaris may be out-
dated." Ruffner concluded.

Complains  

of Enrollment Problem 

By JIM HOSEK

The deanlelect of Pitt's School
of Engineering last week pointed
out that "universities today are
faced with decreasing enroll-

which will be felt in the indus-

Dr. Max Williams spoke at a
Materials Advisory Program-Penn-

gram workshop,_heId at the Grad-
uate School of Public Health,
which was designed to explore
new opportunities for industry/’
university cooperation. ’

"It is engineering and techno!

we are today." said Williams.
"and if we allow things to devel-
ope the way they have been. were

 How Much Do
wWe Need to Know?

By SCOTT MacLEOD

, Now that Bella Abzug has submitted a resolution to the House
calling for the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, we must ask our-
Selves a multiplicity of questions concerning the Watergate conspir-
Tacy and"cover—up scandals. First, how much do the American peo-
ple need to know? This central theme suggests three more questions.

 ,1; Can the committees investigating the scandal possibly learn
the whole truth about the episode, even to the extent that the Presi-
dent was personally involved?

 2. Will the committees be willing to take every possible measure

> . l

 .exp'osin_g those truths?

 ,3. Should the investigating committees reveal, if possible,revery-
'th_i'n‘g there is to know about the scandal, even if it means threaten-
ing national security? i
 Addressing the first question is it possible for the investigating
' ‘committees to find the entire truth? This will undoubtedly be their
-‘ major concern. However, there are very real possibilities of obstruc-
tion, which would eliminate any answer at all to one last question;
is the President involved? '

 ‘Naturally, to convict the President. or at least to find out the
»'/extent of his involvement, testimony would have to be given by the
President’s top aides, namely Haldeman, Erhlichman, and Mitchell.
These are intelligent men, legally and politically speaking, and they

people may never learn the truth.

willing to expose these‘ truths as adequately as their power al-
yvs? Under normal circumstances, it seems that investigators and
prosecutors work hurriedly to amass evidenceand secure convic-
tions. But'in this case, many Senators believe that the indictment
offthe President for impeachment proceedings (which normally
wduld follow first-hand proof of the President’s inyolvement) would
lie extremely dangerous; both to our domestic security and our for-
‘ei‘gnre‘lation's._ ‘ '

  Tenure Decisions Illicit Protest

Dear Dr. Posvar:

We the undersigned graduate
students of the Earth and Plane-
tary Sciences Department are
deeply shocked to learn that ten-
ure has been denied to three
members of our faculty; Drs.
Inoue, Khoury, and Lund. ‘After
they complete the next academ-
ic year, they will be forced to
seek positions elsewhere. Their
absencewill be particularly no-
ticed because they have research
intereststhat cannot be replaced
by the remaining members of
the faculty. Their loss will nar-
row the scope of our department
"considerably. '

We are told that the criterion
used in making tenure decisions
is avague combination of,teach-
ing and research skills. We find
ourselves hard pressed, however.
to find shortcomings in the teach-
ing and research records of these

. three faculty members.

In the area of research, all

three have published many papers
in respected scientific journals.
Those of us _who specialize in
their areas of research find the
quality of their published work-
comparable to that produced by’
other authors in their field. Fur-
thermore, the volume of their
published material is certainly
equal to that produced by other
members of the EPS department.

In the area of teaching, Drs.
Khoury and Lund have had some
of the highest teaching loads in
the department. Those of us who
have been in their classes feel
that their classroom performance
has equaled that ofiany other
senior member of our_depart-
ment. Furthermore, all three have
shown considerable interest in
rendering assistance after class.
a quality that we feel is of great
importance. -

The denial of tenure to these
three faculty members represents
not only a major blow to their
careers. but also to the careers

of those of us who came to Pitt
specifically to work under them.
In our opinion. they served the
department well, and their ab-
sence will be sorely felt. We
beg that you act to investigate
this situation.
Respectfully yours.

As l_write this, the countdown for the Skylab
astronauts has just resumed. By the time it ap-
pears in print. the world's most expensive repair-
men will be within eighteen hours of departure
foradesperately risky mission. ‘ _

The ferociously expensive Skylab has already
been launched; it is the heaviest object ever flung
into orbit." Unfortunately. it is broken. Tempera-
tures inside range from near freezing to about
120 degrees, neatly exceeding both the high and
low limits of human toleration. Food and medical
supplies on board may have been spoiled beyond

-any hope of salvage. The electrical system is pro-

re‘ ducing about‘ one—half of the power required for

the scientific experiments which are the justifi-
cation for the whole project. '

And we are sending three men of the standard

"fragile design we all share up to fix it. We are
giving them about ninety pounds of jangling hard-
ware and a makeshift repair kit. If the problem

- is what it seems to be, there is a chance the re-

pair kit will suffice to fix it.
As lagniappe, we are giving them instruments

/, to detect toxic fumes which may very well be

present. No such detectors" were included in the
original design. __ ‘

foolhardiness, to accept this mission. We are pro-
bably crazy to impose it on them.

The argument for the 'frescue“ mission (can

invested so much money and effort in the first
part of the experiment, we are obliged to go on to
further investments of money and, now, lives, to
salvage what we can.

I would like to recommend a book to ‘NASA and
all other interested parties. It is Exploring New
Ethics For Survival, by" Garrett Hardin. It is

available in-a Penguin paperback for $1.45. and

well worth it. *

I will cite two observations on Progress. which

Hardin expresses as religious dogmas: '

“l. The dogma of Aladdin’s Lamp: If we can
dream of it, we can invent it.

.“2. The dogma of the .Technological Impera-

tive: When we‘ invent it, we are ‘required to use _

it.”

Hardin goes on to assume that our concept of
messianic Progress was laid to rest with the de--
funct_ SST. He may have suffered an excess of
hope. ‘We are playing the same game "again. Hav-.

e ing got one machine in orbit, and being able to

send another up to join it, we will do so, whether
the original purpose can be served or not.

_ Pittsburgh has often been call-
ed the center of the country's
teel industry, and as such. any
‘attack on U.S. Steel, Jones and
_ aughlin, or Bethlehem Steel
‘makes headlines in this town.

| (A recent study, published by
fthe Council of Economic Priori-
' ties _(CEP) , a New York-based pri-
:vate, non-profit research group,
3 is- exactly this kind of attack. The
CEP report maintains that “the
tee] industr_.y’s anti-pollution ef-
‘forts lag far behind what is leg-
;.'a1_l'y required and technologically
;'}possible.”

The study, which focused on 47
1ants,.'with five. of the 12 Penn-
"__sylvania plants in the Pittsburgh
area, has been called by Bethle-
vi-hem Steel, “for its sheer bulk
alone, an impressive work."

_, Yet this comment, and similar
ones from-U.S. Steel, are as posi-
Vtive as the corporations get about
{the study. Perhaps, because the
study pointed to the U.S. Steel

'.o_nd worst of the 47 studied be-

however, was the “generally bias-
ed approach, disputable method-
ology, and editorial thrust of the
document.”

Bethlehem’s statement. which
is reflected in the reactions of
other firms may be put into the
context of an academics approach
to the report.

Dr. Dennis Weeter, assistant
professor of civil engineering,
explained that it was “tough to
evaluate” a report of this sort

- because “people who write them

are sometimes not qualified to do
so.

The companies counter the re-
port ‘in a second fashion. They
explain that "You can't clean up
all the plants all the way. at
one time." (Bethlehem), or “We
have made great achievements
to date, and have a continuing
program to clean up the problem.‘
(U. S. Steel) and "We partici-
pate strongly in the creation and
preservation of acceptable en-
vironmental quality»--in all com-
munities in which the corpora-
tion operates" (Jones and Laugh-
lin).

Another reaction on the part

"of the corporations is to quote

the figures concerning funds em-
ployed in pollution control.

U.S. Steel reports expenditures
of $300 million over the last six
years, and an appropriation of a
similar amount for'the next five.
Bethlehem Steel reports allot-
ments of $230 million in the last
10 years and plans to spend an-
other $230 million over the next
five.

Jones and Laughlin. a smaller
firm. reports spending $105 mil-
lion over the last 22 years. and
expects to spend‘ another $78
million in the upcoming three.

The vastness of these expendi-
tures for anti—pollution programs
on the part of the steel manufac-
turers was put into focus by
Weeter. who said. "if they say
they're spending this kind of mon-
ey on pollution control you can
be sure that they are."

“But are they doing a rational
and conscientious job with that
money is another question,” the
civil engineer added.

Another aspect of the CEP re-
port seems questionable.-accord-
ing to Dr. Jim Miller. associate
professor of civil engineering.
According to CEP the steel cor-
porations are not reaching the
best level of technology possible
in their control of pollution. But.
says Miller. “there are many as-
pects of the pollution problem that
existing technology cannot han-
dle." ~ ’

Miller also pointed out that
there is a lack of "consistency in
emission standards. they get
tougher and tougher all the time.

Bardo Resigns

and a corporation may install
equipment. that they can pay for
over five years. which will be
out-moded before they've paid for
it.“

Weeter agreed that the “lack
of consistent standards” was a
problem. He feels that “what we
lack, most of all, is somebody who
can make judgements and then
enforce them, because in every
case of a report like the Council’s
there are people who are right‘
and wrong on both sides.”

And "then, even if the report.
released Tuesday, stresses that
“no major steel producer emerg-
ed with an over—all good record
in water and air pollution.” the
corporations are unwilling to
commit additional funds to emis-
sions control because of financial
necessity.“ In the last analysis.
as Miller. put it. "it is the pub-
lic who must pay for pollution
control."

David Marshall. co-ordinator

I of Environment: Pittsburgh.

- sold by non-polluters,

agreed with many of the com-
ments made about the CEP report.
Yet he did not agree that the
people must pay for cleaning
up the environment.

“From the economist’s view-
point, goods should reflect, in
their price, the social cost of their

. production,” said Marshall, “and

so products sold by polluting
firms should cost more than those
and the
cost of the equipment will be
offset by an increase in sales.”

Though there‘ is a great deal
of room _for questions concerning
the nature of the actions and re-
actions that should come out of
a report like that published by
the Council, there seems to be no
doubt that the pollution by Pitts-
burgh’s biggest industry. steel
manufacturing is still great.

And even though all of the
people questioned about the re-
port doubted its accuracy. all
agreed that solutions have to be
found.

Budget Freeze Hits Art Dept.

By DEBBIE POPP

- The University’s budget freeze
1S now being felt in the Art De-
partment.

Pamela Bardo has resigned as
director of the Art Gallery in the
Frick Fine Arts building and no
one has been named to replace
her. '

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, Dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences must decide how and who
will direct the gallery. That de-
cision is complicated by the fact
that the budget deems no new

The alternatives are a revamp-

A major responsibility of the

Experienced Cli Chapel

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor Emeritus

Performance problems. just like
problems of interpretation. will
probably plague music as long as
the concert hall continues to sur-
vive as part of our artistic "her-
itage." These problems. so no-
table in the rendition of mammoth
works which reuire massive
choral and orchestral forces. are
perhaps even more ‘easily per-
ceived in more intimate musical
circumstances.

Our case in point here is this '

past Tuesday's performance of

3--‘baroque music. sponsored by our

5n

musical department. and offered
in the very un-baroquesplendor
of Heinz Chapel. The principal dif-
ficulties which arose from this
concert were basically perform-
ance problems and the interpre-
tive difficulties of the evening
stemmed from basically the same.
As’ far as the listener is ‘con-
cerned, the instrumental music

" of Bach and Blavet were meant

for the pseudo-Gothic glory of

Heinz Chapel. Hence, the princi- ‘

pal performance of the evening:
the feeling of baroque intimacy,

nboth spatially_ and sonically, was

lost somewhere “up there” in the
vaults. Even those of us close to
the harpsichord and string ensem-
ble marveled that the sound was
so distant.

This acoustical problem thriv-
ed particularly upon the _delicate
sound of the har.psichord through-
out the evening.°In.the Bach d
minor Concerto, ably performed
and conducted by Don Franklin.
the so1oist's work was swallowed
up by the sound of the string en-

_semble. For as much as this lis-
tener heard of the harpsichord.
Franklin might as well have play-
ed in an airplane test tunnel.

in complete contrast was flut-
ist Bernard Goldbergs virtuosic
interpretation of the Blavet a min-

or Flute Concerto. Rather than a *

muddy undercurrent, we heard a
vibrant. precise tone from his
instrument; evidently the chap-
el’s acoustics play favorites with
various instrumental qualities.

After interval, an Italian Conta-
ta, attributed to J. S. Bach (and
if it was by Bach, one must judge
it as bad Bach) was performed
by soprano Mary Ann Doody flut-
ist Goldgerg, and the string en-
semble ’conducted by Franklin
from the harpsicord. Not terribly
interesting, the da capos only re-
peated uninteresting material and
the general demeanor of the work
inspired ennui rather than delight.

Performance and interpretive
difficulties plagued the string en-
semble in many instances during
the program There was not al-
ways the best rapport between
Franklin, .who conducted from the
keyboard, and his orchestra mem-
bers. Sometimes a nod of the head
was not enough to bring in the
group and the establishment of
tempi was very often a problem.

Nonetheless, despite all of these
difficulties. there were cedtainly
some rewarding moments during
the program. Franklin’s cadenza
at the end of the harpsichord con-
certo, seemingly inspired by the
Fifth Brandenburg Concerto and
the Chromatic Fantasy, was a joy
to hear. _

The orchestras interpretation
of the finale of the Blavet was in-
vigorating for us all (even though
a group of nonprofessionals. their
quality of tone was quite smooth).
And indeed, much of this program
could have been just as invigorat-
ing, if a more conducive environ-

-ment for the concert had been

chosen. Next time, that will hope-
fully be the case.

“We get very good response to
our editorials,” according 'to

Perry. “But what] like most of
all, is that the -reaction is /from
people from all walks of life.

T f"l‘he really ‘fun part’ of it is that
the editorials are read by the gen-
eral manager—a male—but are

. written by, a. female‘. They're sur-

prised when they come in to talk

‘ to theyone who wrote it and they
find out that the writer is a female '

or a Ms. I guess I just write like
what some might consider a
male." . .

Perry said that she can very easi-
ly identify liersell with the current
feministmovement.

“Although I’m not involved in
NOW (National Organization for
Women) activities, I'd like to
think that I’m a part of that move-
ment because after all, I am a
,woman—a black woman.

DIANE PERRY
“Female, Gifted and Black"

» Being black. though. in ‘journal-

’ ism really isn‘t too much of a

burden. according to Perry. "The
price of the ticketitoday in any
field is productivity. Its not the
blackness that counts. lt's merely
performance.

“I’ve won all the awards this

past year in doing something 1 en- .

ognized for it not as a w_oman or
a_black, but as a writer.

 Special to the Pitt News

Jumping star Bill Rea will lead
a contingent of nine Pitt track
athletes into the 97th -annual IC4A
Outdoor Championships this Fri-
day and Saturday at Rutgers Sta-
dium.

Defending’ champion Penn has
been installed as the favorite
among the more than 50 schools
that will enter this Eastern trac_k
showcase. Other top. teams fig-
ures to be Navy, Penn State. Pitt.
Villanova, Maryland, West Vir-
ginia and ‘Williamand Mary.

Pitt made its best showing in 15
points

--v

SUPER JUMPER BILL REA will defend his_,"titles

   

and a third-place finish, but Pan-
ther coach Jim Banner figures
that may be a bit difficultto
match this time.

“I figure the best we can pos-
sibly get is 20-25 points,” Banner
says. “That would put us in the
top 5-6 teams.” _ —

Pitt will again be relying on

the East's top jumper. Bil Rea.

The Panther junior from Eliza-
beth, Pa.,— is the defending IC4A
long jump and triple jump cham-
pion, and will be the favorite to
repeat that feat this weekend.
A_lthough hampered by rain and
cold weather this spring, Rea has

triple jumps this weekend _at ?he IC.4A’s in New Brunswick, New Jer-
sey. Rea is again favored to win both titles again.

 

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIE

In the long and if

jumped over 26 feet in the long
jump and twice been over 50 feet
in the triple jump.

In addition to Rea. Pitt will be
counting on some high places
from its mile relay team and rap-
idly improving high jumper. Tim
Riley. Running for the Panthers‘
mile relay entry will be Chuck
Mozingo, Rich Jackson, Ted Bob-
by. and Jack Patrick. Riley last
week set a school outdoor record
when he high jumped 6-101/4 and
Banner says he is capable of
clearing the magic 7-0 mark. .

Jackson and Mazingo, who as
sophomores are quickly develop-
ing into bonafied sprinters, will
also run in other speedy races.

.Mazingo, who ran a 47.8 quarter

in the Pitt Invitational, will run in

the quarter miletat New Bruns-

Jackson will try his feet in the

Despite a lack of cooperation
from the weather, the Pitt tennis
team posted a 5-4 record this sea-

didn't return to the peak we

streaks, two winning and one

chance in the high jump competi-
tion. Both jumpers were WPIAL
state high jump champions and
they finished one-two in the col-
lege division of the Penn Relays
a few weeks ago. Riley failed to
qualify for the finals in last years
IC"s and Jupin will make his first
appearance.

Bobby, along with his appear-

ance in the mile relay—which by

the way has run a 3l3.3—will run

uled.- The netters suffered defeats
at the hands of Penn State, West _
Virginia, Kent State, and Grove‘
City.

Several of these matches were
rescheduled, and the rains were
so frequent that the netters
couldn’t even practice much.
The first three mentioned teams
were ..the toughest ‘on the sched-
ule, but Grove City would have
been easily defeated if the Pan.-
thers were sharp. ‘

Pitt finally got back on the
winning track for the final two
games._ Alleghenyfell victim to
the Panther attack, and a May 16
victory over Westminster insured

‘a winning season. A total of six

matches were washed out.

Webster is .losing only one
starter, Joel Hurwitz. He should
be able to replace his talent, but
is worried about the spirit Joel
generated. "Well misshis real,
desir_e "to play." said Webster-.
"His efforts over the last four
years were an inspiration to all
the players. That will be hard
to replace." V

The top returnee will be Joel
Kantor, who will be a junior, and
who has been playing number
one since his freshman year.
“Joe could become a really great

~ player next year if he goes to the

net more and gets more aggres-
sive,”-said Webster. “He can be-
come one of the best in the area.”

Other returning juniors include
George. Dieffenbach and Tom
Current, who have played doubles
together the last two seasons.

Current, who played third seed-
ed last season. "needs work on his

net game and his backhand."

according . to Webster. "Tom
was disappointed with his perform-
ance this season-. He's going to
work on his game this summer."

“Dieffenbach didn’t' play as

‘consistent as he’. did when he
_was a freshman,” ‘said’ Webster. »

The Pitt roadracing team open-

day in Warren. Ohio. but. unfor-

--tunately. they weren't around for

the llnlSl'l. The Pitt Javelin suf-
fered a collision on the first lap

 Last weekends race was the

first eastern contest of the 1973
National Sports Car Club circuit.
The Pitt team had great expec-
tations for this race. and up till
the time of the crash. it appear-
ed as though they may start out
with an important win.

'l‘lie Javelin was .running ex-
ceedingly well for the time-

the lirst day. Bob Fryer iound

to an early lead. and keep the
Javelin there for the remainder
of the race.

But, on the second turn of the
first lap, the Ohio State driver
got a little overanxious and at-
tempted to move ahead of the
.Pitt car. As he pulled even with
the Javelin, on the shoulder of the
track, he spun out and hit the
Pitt vehicle broadside. Both cars
were knocked into the infield,
where they remained for the re-
mainder of the race.

The crash was particularly dis-

felt their Javelin was easily the
best car in the race. This was
the first race ever for the Ohio
State team. and their drivers in-
experience can be blamed for the
tragedy. Fortunately. neither
.driver was hurt and the damage to
both cars was only slight.

The Pitt team will now have to
get their Javelin in shape for the
next race which will be held on
June 9 and 10 again in Ohio.
Considering the minor damage
sustained by their car. Fryer feels
the team will easily be able to

- have the Javelin ready.

In other developments. it ap-
pears that the Pitt team may be
soon entering two cars in each
race. The new car will be driven
on an alternating basis by mem-
bers of the pit crew. This will
give some of the other members
of the team an opportunity to
gain some valuable driving exper-
ience. At the present time the
model of the new car is unknown.
It will either be a Dodge Colt
or a Triumph GT6. The car will
not be entered in the sa'me class
as the Javelin. so the Pitt team
will have an opportunity to cop
two top honors at each outing.

The purpose of amateur sports seems to encompas‘ _
idea that professionalism breeds corruption and unhealthy at— ' “J W
titudes, such as winning at any cost. The members of the Pitt a

baseball team have to be wondering if something got lost in the

The Panther mitters were not invited to the NCAA District

11 playoffs. They probably would not have won it. but they'll

never get that chance. because two of the teams that did make

~“"”“"\,the tourney were apparently afraid to find out if Pitt was as
good as they were. ’ ‘ _

The strange happenings were caused by the heavy rains
which plagued all of the spring sports here at Pitt. Four teams .

far. Temple, Penn State, and Buffalo. have all had games rain- She Wants me! V b t ,

avoided rescheduling (or actually playing) Pitt. L

Penn State thrashed Buffalo, 17-0 and_6-0, a week ago Sun-  Wants my ‘Vasque boots ' ' '

day, and it’s obvious that those two won’t be much of an ex-

citing game. Buffalo posted a mediocre 19-11 record, defeating

. such powerhouses as Cannsius and Rochester. Penn State had

 a more impressive 16-5 card. Going into last Tuesday, Pitt
was 10-2.

‘Although playing fewer games. the Panthers won-loss per-
centage was superior to_ those who made the tourney. They
hadn't played the top-notch opponents either and were pro-
hibited from doing so last week. A

The Pitt baseball team, fresh from a convincing victory
over Allegheny on Monday, went. up to Penn State to prepare for
the big game against the Nittany Lions on Tuesday. Upon awak-
ing Tuesday morning, head coach Bob Lewis discovered that it
had rained overnight, but that it was now sunny. "Don’t worry,"
he assured the squad, “They have a tarp here. There won’t be
any problem.” But there was. ‘

When Lewis took his squad over for batting practice one
hour prior to the scheduled 3 o’clock starting time, he was told
by Penn State coach Chuck Medlar that the field was unplay-.
able. It seemed that somebody had forgotten to cover the field,

" and it was in‘ no condition for a game. Not after it had been
raked up all morning insteadof being allowed to dry in the wind
and sun. * C A

Penn State obviously had nothing to gain by playing Pitt.
With Medlar in charge of the selection committee, even though
he couldn‘t vote on Penn State getting an invite, he was friends’
with those who would. Besides. Pitt needed to beat Penn State
to have a chance for an invite.

So Pitt didn't play Penn State. But Penn State was observed
practicing on their freshman field at about 3 o’clock, the time
that the game would have begun. Bear in mind throughout this
that the P.enn State and Buffalo coaches were in contact two days
before.

Buffalo was scheduled to play here on Thursday. The Pitt
ground crew would of course do their best to make the field play-
able, and in fact hashad the Trees‘Field in shape withother
fields in the area were deemed unplayable. Buffalo got in touch
with Lewis Wednesday and told ‘him the team couldn't come
down because they had finals. A

So Pitt didn't make the NCAA tournament. If they had beat-
en Penn State and Buffalo, “It would have been tough for them \,_ Z
not to take us.“ said, Lewis. “We would have liked to play them.   
Not doing so leaves a question in the back of your mind.". 5“

The tournament gets under way next Thursday when Tem-
ple plays Buffalo. Look for Temple to roll over the Bulls. who
don't really belong in a tournament with that record. Penn
State. although a bit underhanded. has a team that belongs in

Several days ago the almighty NCAA announced that Fred
Samara, a decathon senior from the University of Pennsyl-
vania was ineligible to compete in his senior year because he
competed in the United States-Russia track meet at Richmond
several months ago. That was the meet that Pitt track coach
Jim Banner was forced to resign from coaching because of pres-
sure from the NCAA.

Samara turned around and filed a suit against the NCAA.

and lo and behold, long before the case ever got to court. the
NCAA has decided that Samara is eligible. -

lt’s hard to figure what goes through the heads of these     

social edifices that run the NCAA and AAU, but right now they‘re

running scared because the Senate has opened hearings to try to A . M°""tai" Tm“ Sh°P Mountain Trail Sh°P S°”*h

. Siegel Leads leer--4-1Win

by ROBERT MACK ,
Associate Sports Editor

The Panthers got back on the
winning track last Monday night
by defeating the Mallers. 4-1. at
the Alpine Ice Chalet. The victory
brought the Panthers record to
4-2.

Ron Siegel led the Panther
scorers with a pair of goals. his
fifth and sixth of the campaign.
Jeff Leston and Dan O‘Shea also
lit the red lamp for the'Panthers.

The lvlallersoffense wasnt any
match for the Panther defense.
putting only 10 shots on Panther
goaltender Bart Mack. Defense-
men Kerry Browne and John Fin-
ney did-an admirable job: keep-
ing the Maller“s from getting oft
shots from close in.

At 8:32 of the first period,‘ Sieg-
el w‘as tripped by Billy Harris and

the Panthers promptly capitalized l

on the man advantage, Siegel and
Jim Richter combined for Les-
ton to pick‘ up his fifth goal of the
season. Leston picked up. there-
bound of Richter’s shot and flip-

ped the puck into a virtually open"

net. V
"I, almost didn‘t shoot the
puck.” Leston admitted after the
game. "There was open net in
front of me and I couldn‘t believe
It."

Siegel picked up both of his
goals in the ‘second period, on the
same shift. The Panthers carried
the play throughout the contest.
and Siegel used his quick shot
from the slot to-beat Mailer net-
minder Paul Hoganson.

On the first goal, Siegel picked .

up thepuck in thetcorner and
walked in on Hoganson. Firing for
the low right hand side. Siegel

"slipped as he shot but the puck

made the back of the ’nets and
Siegel fired the rubber into the
upper right hand corner ‘befor
Hoganson could move. ' .

Dan O’Shea gave the Panthers
all the insurance they needed with
a power play goal early‘ in the
third‘peri_od. The Mallers mount-
ed their best offensive threat of
the game when Steve Steve Card-.
well broke in alone on the ‘right
wing. Cardwell fired from the

faceoff circle but Mack made the
save and Browne cleared the puck
from danger.

The Mallers spoiled Mack.s
shutout late in the final frame
when Jack Egers put his team on
the scoreboard. Egers picked up
-the puck from behind the net and
swungaround the left post un-
molested. Turning wide, he fired
the puck and it deflected off
Mack's outstretched goal stick,
hit the far post, and deflected in.

The Panthers will be action
next on Friday, June 1, when they
face the Hillcats at 6:45 p.m. at
the Alpine. , In the meantime,
_Frank’s Lunch, with ex-Pitt skat-
ers Bill Glanville, Phil Clarke
and Denny Browne continues to
tear up the summer circuit.
