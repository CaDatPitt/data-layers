Student
passes away
in t rafting
accident

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

The remains of a rafter who
went missing Saturday in Fayette
County were recovered Monday
night and identiﬁed as a former
Pitt student. ,

Robert Vega, 22, of Lancaster,
was last seen on Saturday after he
fell into the water while rafting
at Ohiopyle State Park. The park
manager designated the search for
Vega, which was a recovery effort
instead of a rescue effort Saturday
afternoon. His body was recovered
from the Youghiogheny River 7
p.m. Monday.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said that records show Vega grad-
uated last spring with a bachelor’s
degree in psychology and political
science. He had also been admit—
ted into Pitt’s School of Law.

In addition to his studies,
Vega worked as a Pathﬁnder for
all four years that he was at Pitt.
Deborah Rupert, senior associate
director of the Office of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid said that,
of the roughly 170 Pathﬁnders who
usually work for the office, Vega
stood out. .

Vega began working for the of-
ﬁce as a Pathﬁnder in his ﬁrst term
as a freshman.

“It is such a competitive pro-
cess to be hired as a Pathﬁnder
that not very often do we hire ﬁrst-
term freshmen,” Rupert said. ‘

Fate of humanities grad programs in question

Unizzersity considers closing relzgions studies, ending admissions to at/aers

Cristina Holtzer
For The Pitt News

This September, Pitt officials will decide
whether certain graduate programs within
the humanities will be cost effective enough
to remain available.‘

If Pitt’s administration elects to pass
current proposals, admission to graduate

F programs in German and the classics will

be “indeﬁnitely suspended” until further
notice. Additionally, the religious studies
graduate department would be entirely ter-
minated by_2022, under the current plan,
which was proposed last m’onth"and,iSvcur—
rently under consideration." ‘ if ' 
The University’s plan reﬂects a nation-
wide pattern of universities cutting or termi-
nating humanities programs at higher rates

than the sciences in order to meet ﬁnancial

constraints.

According to Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele,
the proposals will not be released publicly
until September after the University has
decided whether or not to follow them. In
early June, Provost Patricia Beeson’s office
received the proposals from University ofﬁ-
cials, and they will be “reviewed internally”
until their release. In a statement Chancel-
lor Mark A. Nordenberg issued in February
2012, he alluded to a change on the horizon.
Although the state cut its total budget by
one—tenth.of 1 percent, Nordenberg said the
cuts would disproportionately affect Pitt.
Despite the state reducing its total budget
by about $22.5 million, it cut funding for Pitt
by more than twice that amount.

According to the same statement, Pitt’s
state funding had been reduced so signiﬁ-
cantly that the budget, when adjusted for
inﬂation, would be equal to what it was in
the mid 1980s, when Pennsylvania’s budget
was about one-third of what it is at present.
When left with such a relatively small budget,
the University has a few choices to make
—— it must either spend sparingly or raise
student tuition to make up the difference.

“I appreciate the ﬁscal restraints that Pitt

and other institutions of higher education
are under in this economy,” Department of
Religious Studies Chairwoman Linda Pen-
kower said. ‘-‘[But] rather than hold an hon-
est and open discussion with the Dietrich
School faculty about the future of education
and how to deﬁne what constitutes value
in higher education, this administration
has chosen, in my opinion, a short—sighted
and reductive approach in dealing with the
humanities.” _

Penkower, as well as the rest of the de-
partment, is upset by the proposal to close
down the graduate program.

_ She said that admissions to graduate
programs in classics, German and religious
studies were all suspended in April 2012.

The University wili decide in September whether to terminate the graduate religious
studies program. Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor

Since then, none of these departments have
been allowed to admit new graduate stu-
dents for the academic year 2013 cycle nor
subsequent years.

Fedele declined to comment with a re-
sponse to Penkower’s feelings, stating again
that the proposals will be discussed with the
public in September.

In President Barack Obama’s 2013 State
of the Union Address, he placed high impor-
tance on encouraging the nation's children
to study ﬁelds in math and science.

According to data the National Science

Foundation collected last yea-r, the fed-
eral government paid for just 20 percent

of humanities programs in 2011 at public
institutions that receive federal funding,

while paying for more than 70 percent of '

mathematical and physical sciences at those
same institutions.

Publicly funded institutions of higher
learning across the country are dealing with
not only state, but also federal budget cuts.
Such measures are causing Pitt, as well as
some other schools that receive public fund-
ing, to re-evaluate certain courses that have
low enrollments and do not bring in as much
ﬁmding from student tuition.

Pennsylvania
DOMA
challenged in
federal court

Patrick McAteer
Editor in C/zzef

Three Pittsburgh-area couples were named
plaintiffs in a lawsuit that demanded the
recognizance of same—sex marriages under
Pennsylvania state law, ﬁled by the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union in a Harrisburg
federal court Monday.

The ‘three couples from Allegheny
County, who joined 10 other couples
and one widow statewide in the lawsuit,
included Deb and Susan Whitewood, of
Bridgeville, joined as litigants by their
daughters Abbie, 16, and Katie, 14; Fre-
dia and Lynn Hurdle, of Crafton’Heights;
and Dawn Plummer and Diana Polson, of
Point Breeze. ,

Philadelphia law firm Hangley Aronch-
ick Segal Pudlin & Schiller joins the ACLU
in ﬁling the lawsuit, which names a num-
ber of state‘ and county government of-
ficials, notably Gov. Tomcorbett and
State Attorney -General Kathleen ‘Kane,
as defendants.

The lawsuit also rrames state Health
Secretary Michael Wolf, whose agency
provides marriage licenses requiring the
name of a bride and groom, as well as two
county Register of Wills, Donald Petrille,
of Bucks County, and Mary Jo Poknis, of
Washington County. Poknis is named in the
lawsuit because her office refused to offer
a marriage license to the Whitewoods.

Nils Hagen—Frederiksen, press secre-
tary for the Pennsylvania Office of the

F General Counsel, said attorneys in the of-

ﬁce were currently reviewing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit asserts that Pennsylvania’s
1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which de-
fines marriage as ‘between one man and
woman, has been invalidated in light of
the Supreme Court’s decision to strike
down the national Defense of Marriage
Act two weeks ago.

Under the 5-4 decision, the court invali-
dated a federal law that defined marriage

as between one man and one man. It did .

not, however, clarify whether the right to
marry is a constitutional right, nor did it
eliminate laws banning gay marriages in
states nationwide". '

Witold Walczak, ACLU of_-Pennsylva-
nia’s legal director and an attorney in the
case, said in an ACLU press release that
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit share almost
all of the same characteristics of legally
married couples. ,

Pitt announced earlier this week that
it has chosen a new vice chancellor for
communications.

Kenneth P. Service, executive director
of the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Edu-
cation, -will assume the position on Aug.

1. Service has formerly worked for Pitt ‘

as director for news and information, a
position he held between 1994 and 2001.

“It is my good fortune — and the good
fortune of the University of Pittsburgh —
that Ken Service has agreed to return to
Pitt,” Chancellor Mark N ordenberg said
in a statement Pitt released Wednesday.

In addition to his previous position at
Pitt, Service has worked for public rela-

. tions departments at several other area

institutions of _higher learning. Before
his current position with PCHE, which
he took; in 2010, he was vice president
for institutional relations at La Roche
College in the North Hills, according to
the same statement. .

, He has also worked in senior commu-
nications and institutional advancement

positions at Carnegie Mellon University, '

Duquesne University and the University
of Cincinnati. From 1987 to 1994, before
Service took the position of director of
news and information with Pitt, he held
multiple publicfrelations director posi-
tions with Duquesne Light Company.
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in
an email that Service ‘‘will be reshaping

'the focus of this senior position to better

serve the communications needs of the
overall University, as well as the those of

the schools and departments within the
University,” in his role.

Service sits on the boards of directors
for United Cerebral Palsy—Community

Living and Support Services of Pitts-.

burgh, Pittsburgh Mercy Health System,
Bulgarian-Macedonian National Educa-
tional and Cultural Center, Sisters Place,
Holy Family Institute International Un-
dergraduate Education Program and the
Sister Thea Bowman Foundation.

He is also a member of the advisory

boards of several other community or-

ganizations.
“Beyond respecting his professional
stature, all those.who know Ken recog-

nize him to be a caring,'capable, thought- ’
ful and kind person,” Nordenberg said.-

“And I look forward to working with him
again.”

are the cornerstones of marriage. They are

one — under Pennsylvania law,” he said.

‘According to the lawsuit, legislators
who enacted the original amendment ban-
ning same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania
had a “moral opposition to same-sex mar-
riages  and support of the traditional
family unit” as well as a belief that the

tax beneﬁts extended to same-sex couples"

Legislators at the time, the lawsuit
states, also believed that children raised
by same-sex couple parents could miss
out on the beneﬁts provided by a hetero-

. sexual couple.

The lawsuit refutes all three argu-
ments, saying that overwhelming evi-
dence has arisen over the last 17 years to
disprove them.

“None of these justiﬁcations —— or any
other justification that might now be of-
fered —— passes constitutional muster,”

McGinley, ﬁeld director for the Pennsyl— '

Vania Family Institute, said the decision to
attempt to change the deﬁnition of mar-
riage through the legal system excluded
the state’s electorate from the process.

“It is disappointing to see this strategy
being used,” McGinley said.

McGinley said that the Pennsylvania
Family Institute planned to alert support-
ers across the state of the ACLU lawsuit,
though he acknowledged that it would
be difﬁcult to alter the process since the
ACLU decided to wage a “behind-the-
scenes battle” on the definition of mar-
riage through the legal system.

For the lawsuit’s supporters, however,
the ﬁling of the lawsuit presented yet an-
other step toward social equality in Penn-
sylvania. Deb Whitewood, who entered
into a civil union in Vermont with her
partner, Sue, in 2001, said in an ACLU
press release that she joined the lawsuit

. as a plaintiff in hopes of one day enjoying

the benefits already extended to hetero-
sexual couples.

“We only want what every married
couple wants — to express our love and
commitment in front of friends and family
and the security and protections that only
marriage provides,” she said.

GRAD CUTS

According to the University’s list of grad-
uate students, fewer than 20’students are
currently enrolled in the religious studies
graduate program. Similarly, only 11 stu-
dents are currently enrolled in Pitt’s gradu-
ate German program and eight students are
enrolled in the graduate classics program.

In contrast, graduate programs in tech-
nology and science-oriented areas, such
as computer science, have upwards of 90
students enrolled.

. Amy Slagle, who earned her Ph.D. in re-
ligious studies and is now a professor at the
University of Southern Mississippi, said she
is saddened by the possible closure of the
religious studies graduate program.

“Not only did I receive a solid founda-
tion in the diverse theories and methods

available for the study of religion across‘
cultural contexts, but the program afforded
doctoral students an opportunity to tailor

education in the humanities as less desirable

than those in disciplines more focused on i

science and technology, several employers

world religions and cultures is ever more

their course of study according to their own

interests and dissertation projects,” Slagle

said of the program. _ .
While the federal government might View

would agree with Slagle that a liberal arts
education can still be an asset.
In a study conducted by the National Hu-

manities Commission, 51 percent of Arr_ieri— '

can employers said they would endorse the
concept of a liberal arts education to possible
employees. In that same study, three out of
four employers said they would recommend
a “liberal education” to their own child. '

Although closing the program will save
money and undergraduates will still be able
to major in religious studies, classics and
German, Slagle insisted that closing the re-
ligious studies graduate program “would
be a true loss to the University community
and beyond.” A .

“The ability of persons to reﬂect deeply
on matters relating to world religions and

cultures is ever more pertinent and acute Q

in today’s world. The fact that an impor-
tant institution of higher learning like [Pitt]
is signaling a possible disinterestin this
pursuit in eliminating the religious stud-
ies graduate program is disappointing and
disheartening,” she said. I

to reprimand employees for issues such as ‘

tardiness, she said that she never had to do
so with Vega, whom she called “just a good,
good kid,” who took a lot of satisfaction
from his work.

Jim Juran, the manager at Ohiopyle
State Park, said that he initially declared
the search a recovery effort for several
reasons, When he made that decision at

4 p.m. Sunday, Vega had been missing for

' approximately 28 hours since he fell into

the water at a point in the river above Swim-
mers Rapid. . _
Juran said that according to witnesses,
Vega’s personal ﬂotation device had slipped
off when he fell in the water, also increasing
the likelihood that he had not survived.
Additionally, water levels in the river
were rising, and there was a severe thun-
derstorm in the area. Juran said that after
declaring the search effort a recovery rather
than rescue, park staff continued to search

for Vega’s remains, but he did not ask for
additional resources for the effort.

Fayette County Deputy Coroner Alissa
Williams said that Vega’s remains were
found at Bottle of Wine Rapids, more than
a quarter mile down the river from Swim-
mers Rapid. .

She said that the coroner’s office is still
working to determine the cause of Vega’s
death. The coroner’s ofﬁce also has not
conﬁrmed the time of death.

Rupert said that it was unclear when
there would be a memorial service for Vega.

But when one is scheduled, the OAFA plans
toisend any Pathﬁnders who can attend the
service to Lancaster so that they can show
their support. - A

“All of the staff at [the OAFA] has his
family and loved ones in their prayers,”
Rupert said. -

juran called the incident that claimed _

Vega’s life a “tragic accident” that was not
typical at the park.

down this river annually without incident,”
he said. I I

Ramadan: at time to remember
tradition and roots

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

“Ramadan Mubarak!” read
several text messages I
received Tuesday. Cousins,
aunts, uncles and family
friends hundreds of miles
apart took a moment to
break the distance. With
each text, despite their
busy lives, they extended
welcomes during this ex-
citing time of year.

I spend little time out-
side of important family’
functions communicating
with them, partly because
of distance and partly
because of the awkward
differences in our level

of Ireligiousness —- thank
goodness for privacy
features on‘Facebook.

But this is the nice thing
about tradition: It acts as

a staple in unifying us, a
concrete contradiction to
the blurred cultural rules
between those who strictly
adhere to Islam and those
who do not.‘

Congratulations from the ’_

family act to remind me
that while the rest _of my
Muslim relatives and I do
not exactly share the most
perfect connection to each
other regarding religion,
the connection we have is
very strong, and just like
the traditional concept of
Ramadan, it has resisted
change overtime.

Our use of cell phones to
connect with each other

during this holiday is one
of the nicer examples of
modern life mixing with .
tradition. Combining

the old and the new,the
friendly iMessages, emo-
jis and smilies exchanged
between me and my
cousins function like an
inside joke that our parents
certainly aren’t a part of.
But for most Muslims in
America, speciﬁcally those
of the ﬁrst generation, this
modern inﬂuence comes
at a confusing cost. The
intermingling of western
life and eastern ideals,

our peers and our parents,
it leaves many feeling as
though we can’t give full
satisfaction to anyone.
Islam is a religion that
boasts peace and modesty
and typically embraces the
past heritages, that has led
us to the religion.

The United States’ mental-
ity is, conversely, for-
ward thinking, constantly
pushing the boundaries"
.we currently have along-
side a culture that screams
anything but modesty. The
problem is that, for most
Muslims in the young-
adult age group,'being a
representative for both is’
relatively important to_ us.
But this awkward pairing
is not the primary reason
why young Muslims feel
lost in this country. Rather,
it’s the defensive tone we’
almost automatically as-
sume regarding our‘ reli-

gion. This generation of
Muslims had their grade-
school experience marked
by the memory of hearing
the news of 9/11 from
teachers and of watching
the media with confusion
as they disparaged the
religion that raised us.
Polarization within the
demographic as a result of
this deﬁning event exem-
pliﬁes the sense of confu-
sion it inevitablycreated.
Some Muslims ch_ose to
cling closer to their reli-
gion by deciding to wear
hijabs or increasing par-
ticipation within Islamic

communities. Some sought

to move away, either from
a genuine loss of belief or
ﬁom growing tired of the
antagonizing environment,
allowing only their Ara-
bic last names to connect
them to the religion. The
remainder fell into a faded,
in—between stance, ﬁnding
little beneﬁt from either '
position. In addition to
feeling lost within our na-
tion, many youngAMuslims.
became lost among each
other. ' l f

Taking these factors into
consideration, the title
“Muslim” for Americans
of this age requires you to
fulﬁll many roles: a de-
fender, a representation, a
juggling act and a teacher.
We are constantly ex-
plaining that Allah is just

On Monday night at Mr. Small’s Theatre, Fitz
and The Tantrums showed Pittsburgh that,
although it’s a bandin transition, its mem-
bers still know how to make a crowd roar.

Once the opener, Ivy Levan, had vacated
the stage after an underwhelming perfor-
mance, the time had come to see Fitz and
The Tantrums’ new album tested on a live
stage. Just under two years before this per-
formance, the band had wowed a similarly
large and excited crowd at Mr. Small’s with
its dapper suits, stage presence and irresist-
ible brand of neo-soul.

But the past year had seen the band shift

ing in the surprising and somewhat disap-
pointing release of More thanjust a Dream in
May. Would the two live performances differ
as much as the band’s two albums?

Yes and no. The minute Fitz and ‘company
stepped onto the stage, it was clear that the
band had transformed. Frontman Michael
“Fitz” Fitzpatrick and saxophonist James
King had ditched the sharp suits and ties in
favor of sneakers, jeans, T-shirts and light
jackets, while vocalist and tambourine aﬁ-
cionado Noelle Scaggs rocked shorter hair,
black stockings, shorts and a top that had no
semblance of the ‘6os motown style she had
brought to the same stage less than two years

before.
Yet the band’s exuberant energy — the

version of the band opened up with More

it was clear that King’s incredible saxophone
play, Scaggs’ dance moves and driving cha-
risma and all of Fit_z’s bandstanding antics
still essentially drove the live performance.
They brought bells and whistles this time
too. Behind the band was a giant series of
snaking lights, which formed a.heart iden-

Throughout the show, the apparatus ﬂashed

lights, however, Fitz’s manic movements
around the stage and Scaggs’ ability to play
the hell out of the tambourine while keep-
ing time, dancing and belting out choruses
remained the most entertaining parts of the
act.

Throughout the performance, the band
switched back and forth between old and
new music with ease, and although crowd
members had been enamored with both,
they clearly favored the hit songs off Pickin?

Furry enthusiasts flock to Pittsburgh’sAnthrocon

Matt Singer
Staff W‘rz'Ife'r

Over the weekend, Anthrocon, the
world’s largest furry convention, came to
Downtown’s David L. Lawrence Convention
Center and brought with it some 5,000 at-
tendees, who took part in everything from a
Fursuit Parade to panels on how to improve
one’s digital animation skills.

Each year, Anthrocon brings together
furries -— some of whom are known for
their fandom of anthropomorphic fantasy
animals and the costumes they wear to re-
semble them — from all over the United
States, as well as several countries abroad.

Although the furry community’s most
recognizable constituents are the ones who
don their fursuits — full-body costumes
that can cost upward of several thousand
dollars — the majority of the subculture
sport casual wear. According to Anthrocon
Publications Director Karljorgensen, only
about 20 percent of attendees came to the
Pittsburgh event suited—up.

Much of the interest furries have in their
subculture is predicated on a ﬁercely dedi-
cated appreciation of the arts.

Pittsburgh’s arts scene threatened
by public transport woes  

John Lavanga
A€®’E Editor

Last weekend, the Deutschtown Music Fes-

” ‘tival took'over;several_ bars, —t-aver-n»s;-record «~

stores and other impromptu venues across
the Deutschtown section of the North Side.

The event showcased more than 40 bands‘

that scattered around a fascinating, though
oft—neg1ected, neighborhood of the city for
no cost whatsoever and served as a perfect
example of all the tremendous successes —
and glaring issues — that the Pittsburgh arts
scene has accumulated in recent years.

The result was an incredibly accessible and

' friendly festival that allowed curious attend- ‘

ees to discover the city’s emerging talents.

After sets, bands would pack up their gear ‘

and come back to grab a beer and chat with
their fellow Pittsburghers while the next band
geared up to wow audiences ‘with another
short set of surprisingly original music.

The city’s small—town feel was on ﬁill dis-
play. Many who attended realized that they

weren’t far removed from most of the people .

on stage and in the audience. It was a great
moment for a neighborhood and a city to
come together and congratulate themselves
on a music scene that’s heading in the right
direction.

But that could soon change, and the city’s
continuing issues with accessibility are to
blame.

Though the Deutschtown neighborhood
is an area with a culture and vibe all its own,
it’s no surprise that the area is so often over-
looked by the broke, carless 20-somethings
that compose a large constituency of our
generation. Because with the public trans-
portation system as effectively defunct as

; it is —- especially on weekends —— taking a

trip to an area as close—by as the North Side
becomes a voyage that will take hours, if it
can be made at all. ’

This transportation problem isn’t unique
to the city’s North Side either. Numerous ven-
ues around the city are currently inaccessible

because of the patchwork of bare—bones bus
routes that now make up our public transpor-
tation system. Two great venues that exem-
plify this problem are Mr. Small’s Theatre in
Millvale,which has_12s:qo_r.r1<:.Pi..tt_Sl?‘%rgh’S best
mid-range venue-by virtue of its é3:c'e‘1Iéht
booking choices and unique atmosphere,

' and 222 Ormsby in Mt. Oliver, the grocery

store—turned—punk venue that provides an
unrivaled DIY atmosphere.

Both of these venues are testaments to
Pittsburgh’s diverse appetite for the arts, but
getting to either is never an easy task for mu-
sic lovers. It’s a confusing mishmash of bus
rides and long walks through sleepy neighbor-
hoods that makes seeing a weeknight show
a real drag and causes arriving to a weekend
show on time a matter of praying to the Port
Authority gods for mercy.

Without easy accessibility and affordable
public transit, it’s hard for those in the arts
community —_most of whom don’t proﬁt
from their passions — to get around, and it’s
hard to foster the sort of tight—knit commu-
nity that is conducive to a healthy arts scene.

Unfortunately, the public transportation
situation is only worsening. Onjune 16, 430
total stops were eliminated across 36 routes,
and the failure of the Pennsylvania legislature
to pass any sort of transportation funding
promises makes the situation appear dire as
the city moves forward.

Whether this is the result of misplaced
priorities or congressional ineptitude is up
for debate. What can’t be debated, though,
is that Pittsburgh as a whole, and especially
its burgeoning arts community, will suffer.

The Deutschtown Music Festival demon-
strated the great features of the music scene,
but also laid bareits incredible vulnerability.
There are dozens of reasons to ﬁght for in-
creased funding for public transit, and the
economic implications of the transit cuts will

go far beyond concert venue accessibility. But-

these recent developments threaten an arts
scene that isn’t yet strong enough to stand up
without the support of a solid infrastructure.

in preparation for “Breakin’ the Chains of
Love,” the eruption from the crowd felt

“as though it shook the foundations of the

church—tumed venue they ﬁlled.
Unfortunately, some of the tracks on the
new album, though met with cheers, clearly
didn’t carry the same live heft as theolder
ones. “House on Fire,” which Fitz introduced

. with a lengthy and just slightly too personal

anecdote about being cheated on, didn’t res-
onate quite as well as expected.

Despite the subdued reaction to some of
its songs, the band displayed an impressive

level of endurance. After taking the stage, _

keeping Pittsburgh cheering and tearing
. through tracks with glee and passion. After
closing out with “L.O.V.” to end the-night,
the band answered the lengthy calls for an
encore with another half—hour of show-
manship, which included its new hit, “The
Walker,” old hit, “Mo_neyGrabber,” and a jaw-

dropping cover of The Raconteurs’ “Steady '

as She Goes.” It was clear that the audience
had earned the band’s respect.

More than anything, Fitz and The Tan-
trums looked comfortable. Over the course

of several years, the band has found its niche 1

don that niche in favor of making whatever

best traits. According to Beagle, furries don’t
judge one another artistically or socially.
The social and artistic air of the furry

Andy Runton, author of the Owly graphic
novel series, said that the “mainstreamness”
of non—furry conventions proves that they
lack the sort of creativity that Anthrocon
brought to the table and "the individuality

“I’ve just been blown away because at nor-
mal conventions, a lot of people are licensed
characters, like Superman,” said Runton.
“These are all original creations, and that’s
what makes it so cool because everyone is
supporting each other as creators just by
coming here.” ,

and as artists, the furries of Anthrocon also

Pittsburgh as its recurring home since 2006,
it has raised about $100,000 for charities
around the city and area, such as Hello Bully

This year’s charity, Equine Angels Rescue,
is based in Cabot, Pa., and works to reha-
bilitate injured, sick or harmed horses and
ponies, as well as care for them if rescued

zation’s founder, said that she was speechless
when she learned that she could expect to
bring about $20,000 back to her charity at
the conclusion of Anthrocon. ,

“I would have never expected this kind of
giving,”. Vivirito said. “We’ve had to be car-

However, despite its reiverence for artis-

F IFA needs to act more seleciel n chsing ho

The Confederations Cup, an international
men’s soccer tournament involving such
powerhouses as Spain and Italy as well.as
lesser teams such as Tahiti, ended Sunday.
But what became a more interesting as-
pect of the event were the protests and their
intersection with the action on the ﬁeld.
The past two weeks were meant to serve
as a sort of trial run for the bigger compe-
titions that Brazil will host in the coming
years v— the World Cup next summer and
the Summer Olympics in 2016. If the civilian
attitudes during this much smaller tourna-
ment are any indication, Brazil has the mak-
ings of an explosive uprising on its hands.
Millions hit the streets of Brazil’s major
cities before the tournament’s ﬁrst game
June 13 to protest a rise in the cost of public
transportation fares, a decision some mu-
nicipal governments have since changed.
The demonstrations then became broad-
er in focus, turning attention to the abysmal
quality of public services such as education,
health care and the rising cost of living. The
issue that laid the foundation for all the dis-
cord is that as the country prepares to host
two of the world’s biggest sporting events
and incur all the costs that such a commit—
ment entails, it continues to ignore sectors
still in dire need of ﬁnancial support.
The conflict didn’t spill over into the
stadiums for the most part, but the ways in

The Confederations Cup served as a catalyst for major demonstrations throughout Brazil last month.

which it did proved worrisome. Gabriele
Marcotti of ESPN FC tweeted on the day of
the ﬁnal between Brazil and Spain, “11,ooo
law enforcementand army officials outside.
Fire raging on hillside Mangueira favela up

the road. Safe and sound at Maracana.”
The protests made focusing on the soc-
cer, without thinking about what was go-

ing on outside the arenas, difﬁcult, which

seemed to be the point.

‘ Pitt senior defensive tackle Aaron Donald

Pittsburgh fans struggle at gauging player talent, value

Nates Barnes
Sports Editor

Every year when the respective seasons of
each Pittsburgh professional sports team
end, it seems as though topics become
increasingly complicated and that fans

of the Penguins, Steelers and Pirates even
more than when the teams were actually
playing. . .

Just listen to the radio. Want to hear
about you-r ﬁrst—place Pittsburgh Pirates?
Well, hold it right there, we have to talk
about Craig Adams first.

But, in listening to all ofthis noise —
because it’s"rather unavoidable — there
appears to be some sort of deep-seeded
vitriol among Pittsburgh sports fans when
it comes to Pittsburgh franchises retain-

certain fans’ desires are executed by the
franchises, it leaves the on-ﬁeld product
wanting. »

Let’s remember, Pittsburgh, Hines
Ward held out of training camp in 2005,
but everyone is still quick to tout him
as a “class act,” and fans still voted for
him to win “Dancing with the Stars,” de-
spite Wallace showing more talent in his
fourth year in the league than Ward ever
possessed. V

Anyway, Steeler management then
gave the money to Antonio Brown in a
six-year, $48 million deal, which effec-
tively sealed the end of Wallace’s tenure in
Pittsburgh, as the Steelers do not negoti-
ate during the season — a stupid policy.

But it’s also ironic in that, without
Wallace, Brown probably wouldn’t have
received that six-year deal.

Pittsburgh fans might say Brown is
a good guy and that they love watching
him in those “It]ust Tastes Better” com-
mercials for Uncle Charley’s sausage, but
good luck trying to watch a N o. 2 receiver

that has no deep threat, let alone demand
the attention of two defensive backs on
every snap.

’ For hard proof, just look at Wallace’s
first four years in the league: 235 recep-
tions for 4,042 yards and 42 touchdowns.

1,964 yards in 2012. And‘ yes, his name
is Calvin Johnson, the Detro-it Lions star
receiver: You might have heard of him.

Don’t forget that this is the third time
in Ben Roethlisberger’s career that he had
his best pass-catcher taken away from
him. Nice work, Kevin Colbert.

Exhibit B:’ Kris Letang-Evgeni Malkin

Look, I know next to nothing about
hockey, but I will say that when you
think the second-best player in the world

doesn’t deserve to be paid like it, and

one of the league’s top-three defense-
men shouldn’t be kept around, you should
probably wonder if you’re following the
right sport.

Yeah, Letang is more of an offensive
defenseman, but it works out well when
Marc-Andre Fleury has it all together, and
Malkin won the Hart Memorial Trophy
in 2012.

Teams don’t let that get away.

While the disappointing Eastern Con-
ference Finals loss to the Boston Bruins
probably didn’t do much to drum up sup-
port for these two players, it was refresh-
ing to see the Penguins make the right
call. ' B

Exhibit C: Pedro Alvarez?

The date of Pedro Alvarez’s arbitration
eligibility is approaching. Under arbi-
tration, a player’s salary is decided by

varez’s arbitration years to sign him to a
long-term dealand keep him in Pittsburgh
well through his prime, which is what
they should do. I

But, a month or so ago, Rob Biertemp—
fel, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review’s Pi-
rates beat reporter, questioned whether
or not it would be worth it to the Pirates
to extend Pedro Alvarez’s deal. As with
Wallace and Letang, it seemed many Pitts-
-burgherslwere less than keen on the idea.

One fan said he would prefer to see Neil
Walker’s contract extended before Alva-
rez’s. You know, because he’s “from here.”

Look, the months of watching Pedro
hitting .215 are terrible, but when he puts
together a month like he did injune, when
he hit .309 and 10 home runs with an on-
base plus slugging percentage of 1.060,
that’s a guy worth watching every time
he picks up a bat and certainly one worth
keeping around.

Alvarez is the key guy here, even
more so than McCutchen, Jeff Locke or
Jason Grilli because when Alvarez steps
up, things such as a 17-9 month of June
happen, and the Pirates end up with the
league’s best record after 81"games. But
these attitudes seem to derive from the
traditional image of Pittsburgh sports
teams, which might not necessarily apply
anymore. “Steeler football” is a thing of
the past, and the way fans view athletes
should be as well. These are different
players raised in much different circum-
stances than the heroes of the 1970s. ﬂ

the conﬂict, and even if an individual stops

I» watching on TV, no real change results. Link-

ing to a YouTube video or an article as a way

to spread awareness is effective to an extent,
sure, but what good is awareness by itself?

FIFA, the sport’s governing body, has built

a reputation on corruption, so hoping the

0 _organization will be moved to change its ways

in the wake of recent events is delusional. It
will take more than awareness to change the

system that is culpable for the protests, at _

least in some part.
Some people took matters into their own
‘ hands by hacking the 2014 Brazil World Cup

SCHOOL or 

   'ﬂf0 rma

website to demand change from FIFA. Others
continued their efforts. Change FIFA, a move-
ment aiming to reform the world’s governing
body for soccer as its name suggests, has
more than 15,000 followers on Twitter and
shared various links and statistics about the
events in Brazil throughout the tournament.
The organization’s mission statement helps
illustrate the sorry state of theadministrative
site of the sport.

“Freedom For Football. We'seek to reform
world football and football governance so
that it is honest,.free, democratic, transpar-
ent andacc'ountable.” '

The goals of this mission statement should
go without saying. They should be implied
and inherent. But they aren’t. These protests

ion

shouldn’t have occurred. But they did.

There is an easy remedy to these issues,
which is to have common sense become the
standard operating procedure in awarding
these competitions, but getting to that point
is difficult. However, recent developments
suggest that the process has begun.

The responsibility lies not with us, as av-
erage citizens, but with our representatives
to bring about positive change. As people in
the U.S., our hope for improvement lies with
the president of our soccer federation, Sunil
Gulati. In an interview with Sports Illustrated,
he addressed the progress FIFA has, or hasn’t
made, in terms of reform.

“I’d say incomplete. What’s been done up
to now, I think, is a long way toward address-

ing some of the issues, but I think more needs
to be done,” Gulati said. E ~
But on the issue of improving the selection
process for World Cup hosts, the improve-
ments are unclear. All that is known is that

fall FIFA member countries will now have a

say in the process. _

“The changes are incomplete in my view
on the World Cup [host] decision making.
The only formal decision to be made so far
is the ﬁnal decision will be made by [all] 209
countries;” he said.

While that answer doesn’t say much,
here’s to hoping that whatever develops will
keep episodes in Brazil from occurring again
and prevent a dangerous cycle from begin-
ning. I
