Associate Editors, Business
Staff Already At Work;
Seniors Solicited

With plans for one of the most
complete and pictorial editions
of The Owl, student yearbook,
nearing completion, the 1937
staff opens a senior subscrip-
tion campaign today that bids
fair to shatter several all-time
sales records.

Commemorating the 150th anni-
versary of the founding of the Uni-
versity, the 1937 edition will trace
the shifting, changing history of the
University that grew with Pittsburgh.
From the time it was known as the
Pittsburgh Academy to its fast ap-
proaching climax in the Cathedral of
Learning, University progress will be
marked in its sesqui-centennial year
with a complete history book edition
of The Owl.

Two-Month Campaign

The senior campaign will have ap-
proximately a. two-month run, sched-
uled to close previous to the Thanks-
giving recess in November.

Every undergraduate activity of
the University is represented in the
group of 50 senior salesmen that will
make a complete canvass of the class
of 1937. ' Senior subscriptions, selling
at $5.00‘ (ﬁve dollars) include sittings
at the Photo—Reﬂex studio, Smithﬁeld
and Sixth, a picture in the Senior sec-
tion of the annual, and a copy of the
book. Undergraduates will be solic-
ited at a later date. ,

All pictures are to be taken in for-
mal attire. A draping effect will be

used for the women while the men

are to pose in tuxedos. It is empha-
sized that the men may borrow the

start Thursday. Freshmen who peti-
tioned last year in the race for chair-
manship will ﬁnd the same polic.V 0"’-
selection being used this year.

The Hop is scheduled for Novem-
ber 13. Indications are that there
probably will be plenty of competi-

job.

Award Involves Cartwrights,

Santa Claus comes twice a

wright, a ﬁrst semester fresh-
man.

At ROTC drill practice on
Friday, more to his own sur-
prise than to any one else, Cart-
wright was awarded a bronze
medal for being the third liigh-
est, scliolastically, in the fresh-
man class.

Cartwright was deﬁnitely mys-
tified, for Friday was the first
day he had ever been in an
ROTC uniform.

From lieutenant to captain to
general spread the news and
then to the disappointment of
Tom and the humiliation of all

was supposed to go to T. E.

library will be asked to give his name,
address, school, and year, which will
be entered in a ﬁle at the lending

able to the library without recourse
to other University ﬁles as before.

After registration, the University
registration card is stamped and will
have to be shown by the student to
obtain use of the reserve book read-
ing room and the Darlington collec-
tion.

Some 300 entries have been made

since the system was installed, ac-»

cording to Miss Downs. Students
who have not yet been registered are
asked by Miss Downs to do so at
-once.

,Miss Henry Finds

Youth Of France
Resigned To War

Modern Language Associate
Takes Three Courses At
Paris University

Among t h o s e who vacationed

abroad this summer was Blossom L.
Henry, assistant professor in the
Modern Language department. Miss
Henry sailed for France aboard the
Normandie early last July. Once in
Paris, she registered for three
courses at the Sorbonne.

Asked about the labor situation in
Paris following the June strikes,
Miss Henry answered that at the
time of her trip no disturbance was
apparent. However, beneath the
superﬁcial peace there was a current
of unrest and dissatisfaction on the
part of the working classes.

French youths with whom Miss
Henry spoke evinced a cynical atti-
tude toward the European war situ-
ation. War for France they consid-
ered inevitable, and themselves the
necessary victims.

Concerning the European situation,
Miss Henry feels that this same cyni-
cal younger generation may furnish
the solution to the problem. If war
is postponed a few years for econom-
ic reasons, today’s young Europeans
will in time take the helm and change
xiatioiial attitudes.

Ten Years Ago
T WAS JUST 10 YEARS ago, yesterday, according to Thomas
Nee, University night foreman, and seconded by Ulysses S.
Grant, 72, Pitt News night foreman, that the ﬁrst excavation was
made for the present Cathedral of Learning.

Ten years ago, the ﬁrst steam shovel scooped up its ﬁrst load
of top-dirt from Frick acres. At that time the present Cathedral
quadrangle contained an old frame building hous.ing some 300 rab-
bits for the experimental work of Dr. Fish, head of the Biology
department, and the flower gardens of a Mr. Schwartz. On the
Bigelow side, four brick buildings, numbered consecutively from
one to four, included in addition to Zoology laboratories and other
University departments, the office of the old Pitt Weekly.

Since that day
many. things have happened on this spot. One quiet evening three
years later, “General” Grant cleaned the ﬁrst classroom. An en-
gineering group had assembled earlier on that day for the ﬁrst
classroom meeting held in Room 717, Cathedral.

A seven-ﬂoor climb in those days was accepted cheerfully by
both professor and student. More important things like rough
bricks, cement, and steel frames were given preference in trans-
Piercing January winds shrieked through the lower
“Ulysses” Grant made his rounds of “punching the
clock” from the ground to the thirty-sixth floors by lantern light.
There was a moving spirit that guided University men in those
days.

Then came a period of . . .
inactivity on the heels of a national depression.

parted, followed by the stone masons, electricians. Construction

~ ceased. Yet the spirit was still there.

Recently, the ﬂame became brighter. It was not long before
it roared once more. Much was accomplished during the past
year. Beautiful libraries, reference, and reading rooms on the
fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth were completed. The books will come
later. On the seventeenth ﬂoor, Faculty club rooms not only
solved the eating problem for the faculty and administrative|
groups, but also provided a ﬁne social center for this important
section of the University.

This year marks the celebration of the 150th anniversary of
the founding of the University. Two days ago the Post-Gazette,
Pittsburgh morning daily, published a great anniversary edition
to announce their own 150th year, containing a full page announce-
ment of the University’s progress. It is signiﬁcant that every
library and large city in the country will receive the story of the

" rise of Pittsburgh’s “skyscraper” University, the Cathedral of

Learning.

"General" Grant hopes . . .
to live to see it ﬁnished. We hope Chancellor John G. Bowman
lives to do the same. We know most of us will live to see Dr.
Bowman’s dream realized . . . For he has fought long and hard
for this dream. When others foretold failure, he was certain
that success was the only way out. Dr. Bowman’s ﬁfteen years
here have been well spent. But there is much yet to be done.

It took a long one-hundred and forty years to reach that day,
ten years ago yesterday, when the ﬁrst steam shovel dug into the
soft turf where now rests tons of solid concrete and steel. Things
such as these are never quite completely ﬁnished, they are made
of much ﬁner stuff.

. . . He Talked To Himself. . .

By Milton Lehman .

“He talked to himself as he walked the proof—for the proof of the pic-
by himself, and thus to himself said ture is in the negative_but we turn

With these words Chancellor Bow- toward the touchedmp print’ like
man began his message to the student V011,” ﬁnd in the “O“'l’5 Hall Of
body in The Pitt Compass this year. Fame.”

With these words we introduce this
column.

THROUGH PERSONAL experience it
is proved that the proof is not the
ﬁnished product.

There is a certain beauty in walk-
ing and talking to yourself. Possibly
more of us realized it during the suin-
iner, with school behind and the only
assignment that of having a good
time.

The Photographer returned my proof:
It was a proof of

My olfactory organ was elongated,
Proclaiming my unity;

My hair, dishevelled;

Other facial blemishes were

Graphically

Upon my countenance;
Besmirclied was my visage.

He walked by himself and he thought
of the lessons that he had been taught,
and he wondered.

Perhaps the sky was too clear,
too high, yet terribly near,

he pondered, The unlike likeness disclosed

A fake—for had not the hoi polloi
Acclaimed his work

‘So true to life’;

I asked him why

And how he had such nerve

To send me such a proof-

It didn’t look at all like me,

I claimed. He replied,

That is only the

And if vou want, I shall

and it thundered.

Now that Anthony Adverse and his
1224 pages are in the movies, many of
us who followed the oath of the wit
who promised to read Anthony as soon
as he appeared in the Reader’s Digest
are seeing what a Pitt grad can do if
he has enough paper.

When Anthony appeared in a book
some time ago, we were stunned. We
had thought the days of Richardson
were gone. Not so. There is a stout
man with a high forehead who is even
more proliﬁc than Mr. Allen, and
perhaps more brilliant. He, Thomas
Wolfe, has not written one book that
comes near the thousand page mark,
but six.

Wolfe is proliﬁc. He tells and ex-
plains and sometimes editorializes,
and takes his time to do it. But his
work is good, and it is good to read.

.:. Opinion .:.
By J. M. Eichelberger

Out of three months of summer
vacation little remains for me but
memories of travel and the effect of
several books which have stillto wear
off under the impact of English His-
tory and Political Theories. The ac-
tual travel was inconsequential, but
the books were real voyages of dis-
covery. The things discovered were
Thomas Wolfe and John Dos Passos.

Thomas Wolfe, in case you don’t
know, is the author of a huge novel
entitled “Of Time and the River,”
only two volumes of which have been
published. If the succeeding parts of
this work are of the same quality as
the ﬁrst, -the novel will, in my opinion,
become a monumental piece in Amer-
ican literature.

What strikes you about the man is
the flow and cadence of his style and
the lyric quality of his work. At times
his prose becomes indistinguishable
from poetry. I am thinking of a scene
in the second volume, a picture of
drunken youth on the rear of a lighted
observation car on a train roaring
northward through the blackness of
the night. The youth is drunk on both
“corn likker” and the spirit of adven-
ture, his hunger driving him from
home on the wastes of North Carolina
to New England, to Harvard, and to
the “golden land.” The volume is sub-
titled “The Story of a Man’s Hunger
in the Days of His Youth.”

In these pages that hunger soars on
the wings of Mr. Wolfe's lyrics. I
have always thought that good poetry
must do what good prose should do
rather well. In this passage the differ-
ence between prose and poetry is a
nuance more subtle than I should care
to deﬁne. Mr. Wolfe is a great writer,
fundamentally earthy, realistic, and
deeply sensitive to things. “Of Time
and the River” has proved a revelation
which, among others, demolishes my
erstwhile conviction that the last
great novels were written by Russians
at-the turn of the century.

My second discovery, John Dos
Passos, is, I feel, one of the worth-
while American novelists. He has just
published the last volume of a triology
—“42nd Parallel,” “1919,” and now,
“The Big Money.” This is Dos Passos’s

 

own history of America from the be-

ginning of the century, an account,
with merciless realism, of several ﬁc-
titious characters interspersed with
biographies in free verse of such men
as Burbank and Ford. All of which
would not be liked by sentimental
Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion, for Dos Passos exposes bitterness
and gall, frustrated energy, and strips
away all dissimulation and sham, bar-
ing the core of American existence.
Most people would rather not believe
Dos Passos is a realist, and therein
lies a good reason for reading him.

In Dos Passos is found an unusual
development of the novel: two devices,
namely, the “Newsreel” and the “Cam—
era Eye,” both of which succeed in
becoming very tiresome after a hun-
dred or so pages. The “Newsreel” and
“Camera Eye” appear every chapter,
the former being a staccato series of
news flashes from journals of the
time, together with snatches of inter-
views with public ﬁgures and frag-
ments of popular songs; the latter
a piece of subtle, autobiographical,
poetic writing which at ﬁrst reading
is more mystifying than enlightening.
The “Newsreel” is designed to unify
the work by recreating the tenor of
the times, and the “Camera Eye” is
intended to give the novel the depth
of a personal attitude and feeling.
These vagaries from traditional form
have caused the author to be criticised
as a writer of “bastard” novels, a
criticism which I feel is justiﬁed. How-
ever, one soon learns to skip both the
“Newsreel” and the “Camera Eye,”
and to read for biography and fiction
alone. In these Dos Passos is splendid.

Women Prepare
For Annual Prom

,Freshman Hat Designers

To Compete In Contest

Freshman women will be given a
chance to prove their skill at hat de-
signing when they march before the
judges at the Coed Prom, Wednesday
evening, October 7. Cleverness, orig-
inality and workmanship will be the
main points in judging the winning
hats, so freshmen will be busy with

scissors and paste (flour and water
will do) and maybe a bit of card-
board will help.

Last year the prizes were awarded
to Betty Bowman and Lucille Upte-
grafl’. Material for this year’s hats
can be found at the WAA candy
stand in Alumni Hall.

Members of the WAA cabinet in
charge of the Prom are: Audrey
Graham, Ed37; Virginia Boyd, Ed37;
Marion Patterson, Ed39; Louise
Baughinan, Ed38; Betty Cox, Ed37;
Peggy Donley, C39; Ruth Barry,
Ed38; Margaret Trussel, Ed38, and
Ruth Crosby, C39.

Accounting Beginners

Will Use Ayars’ Text

This is the history of the textbook
which beginners in accounting will
use this year: “Fundamental Ac-
counting” by Robert D. Ayars, pro-
fessor of accounting.

Starting with nothing but the title,
a send-off from his own former pro-
fessor of accounting at the University
of Pennsylvania, George McFarland,
and a request to write something
which even freshmen could under-
stand, Mr. Ayars spent seven years
on his book.

After three years of work the man-
uscript was stolen, but luckily enough
the printers had kept a copy of it.

Mrs. Ayars offered herself as the
“guinea pig” on which her husband
could try all his deﬁnitions; Mrs.
Ayars is now prepared to take any
and all accounting exams.

The book will appear as the third
in an accounting series edited by Dr.
Scobey, professor of economics at
University of Wisconsin; the ﬁrst two,
already published, are on “Advanced
Accounting” and “CPA Accounting.”

Panthers Show Power

In Sinking Bishops, 53-O

 

Sophomores Goldberg, Stebbins, Veteran Wood Make
Long Runs As Pitt Scores Eight Touchdowns;
Hard Blocking Marks Opening Clash

 

Turning on more power than Duquesne Light turned off dur-
ing the late St. Patrick Day’s flood, Jock Sutherland s powerful
Panthers served warning to Ol’11O State, Notre Dame, and a few

others with their crushing
53-0, before 20,000 fans at

win over the Ohio Wesleyan Bishops, _
the Stadium on Saturday afternoon.

It was the end of depression in‘
opening game results for the Panther
squad. Not since 1929, the start of
several depressions, have the Pan-
thers given such an exhibit of of-
fensive power. It was in that season
that Pitt swamped a weak Waynes-
burg team by the same score, 53-0,
and went on to complete an unde-
feated record.

With Marshall Goldberg, the sen-
sational sophomore halfback, Curly
Stebbins, another brilliant sophomore
back, and Johnny Wood, a veteran
half, running wild, Pitt followers
were reminded of the good old days
back in ’27 when Gibby Welch and
Whitey Hagan used to worry the
Panther opponents with long runs.

Goldberg Scores Twice

Goldberg, who sparkled in both the
spring and pre—season practices, did
everything and a little more than
what was expected of him. The very
ﬁrst time Goldie was handed the ball
he scampered around right end for
22 yards. An instant later he dit-

toed the run, placing the ball deep-

in Bishop danger zone. Stapulis and
1Rue advanced it to the three-yard
line and Biggie went over for the
first Panther touchdown of the sea-
son. Souchak booted the extra point
to make it 7-0 at the end of the ﬁrst
five and a half minutes of play.
After eight and a half minutes the

Panthers owned another touchdown

when this same Mr. Goldberg, aided
by brilliant blocking, dashed 76 yards
behind perfect interference.
Throughout the entire 60 minutes
of play the Panther line and the back-
ﬁeld gave remarkable and efficient
lessons on blocking to the game, but
overwhelmed, Wesleyan lads. On sev-
eral occasions not a Bishop would be

on his feet at the ﬁnish of a Panther

offensive maneuver, which made it
considerably easier for the Panther
backs.’ It didn’t seem to make much
difference what Panther team was on
the ﬁeld, the third, the second, or
even the fourth, the Ohio Wesleyan
boys were usually sitting on ground
at the completion of a number of
plays.
Stebbins Makes Run

After Goldberg’s two touchdown‘

runs, the Pitt elevens that followed
the varsity on to the ﬁeld kept up
the touchdown parade. Malarkey
and Stebbins teamed to score the
14th to 20th points. Leo went
through for several nice gains before
Stebbins took charge and charged
through the weakening Bishops for
42 yards and six points worth of
Panther stock.

These were the opening plays in
the second quarter and after a change
in halfbacks and a change of a min-
ute’s time on the clocks, the Suther-
land powerhouse changed the score
again. On the kickoff following the
Stebbins’ contribution to the Pitt
cause, Johnny Chickerneo carried the
ball back to the Pitt 47-yard line, a
gain of 32 yards. Then another
Johnny, this one named Wood, pulled
what was perhaps the best piece of
broken ﬁeld running of the day, go-
ing 53 yards for the fourth Panther
touchdown.

Touchdown No. Five came 30 sec-
onds before the end of the ﬁrst half
when Joe Troglione, senior halfback,
sent a 30-yard pass whistling into
Johnny Wood’s hands on the ﬁve-yard
line for the score. As the half ended,
the count was Pitt 34, Ohio Wesleyan
none.

The ﬁnal 30 minutes were much
the same as the ﬁrst 30, except that

the Panthers used more power than
speed in the touchdown parade. La-
Rue scored after a 66-yard march,
then Patrick tallied after a 42-yard
Panther ramble, and Malarkey wound
up the team scoring with the ﬁnal
touchdown following a 59-yard ad-
vance.

All in all, it was a rather perfect
and encouraging start for Sutherland
and his Panthers. The blocking was
exceptionally well done, the reserve
material showed that it really had
the stuff, and the 53 points proved
the Panther power on the offensive.
Perhaps the only thing not proven
was the Panther defensive side, which
in two weeks will be given a supreme
test by Ohio State and company.

,Feely Plans Varied Program

For Novice Sportsmen

Of special interest to the Greek
and independent athletes is the an-
nouncement that entry blanks for
Intramural touch-football will be
available today at Trees Gym and
at the Dean of Men’s office.

Martin J. Feely, director of Intra-
mural activities, reports that he has
made extensive plans for lr.tramural
competition and expects more stu-
dents to participate in this year’s ac-
tivities than ever before.

The number of entrants and their
enthusiasm in last _vear’s competition
gives ample proof that this type of
athletics will continue to hold a dom-
inant place in the affairs of the Uni-
versity. Last year, 250 different ath-
letes took part in the ten activities
which Mr. Feely’s department offered.
In addition to the teams sponsored
by the fraternities, the Engineers,
the Medical School, the Dental School,
and the College, many independent
teams were represented in the various
games.

Cross country, touch football, vol-
ley ball, basketball, boxing, wres-
tling, table tennis, bowling, track and
mushball were among the sports in
the program. Of these, mushball
and basketball probably had the most
participants, but every activity had
a good share of Greeks, scholastics
and independents.

Carlson’s Novice Basketball
Tourney Opens October 12th

Entries will soon be dribbling in to
Dr. H. C. Carlson or the
Stadium floor when novices, both
freshmen and upperclassmen, sign up
for the annual Novice Basketball
Tournament which will open Monday,
October 12th. All eligible candidates
are requested, yea, urged to partici-
pate.

Dr. Carlson plans to run his tour-
nament Monday, Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday. It is important that
each entrant, when ﬁlling out the ap-
plication blank appearing below, sig-
nify what time is most suitable for
him to play. The ﬁrst game of each
day will begin at 2 o’clock and
other teams will play at intervals of
one hour,

No fee is connected with the tour-
nament. All that is necessary to
enter IS 3 Suit. a pair of shoes, a pair
of socks, and a towel. The most
unique uniforms will be awarded

given awards.

The team will be selected from the
floor. This will aid in making the af-
fair a hilarious success. Varsity
members will serve as referees and
Dr. Carlson will act as timekeeper.
A treat is in store for all partici-
pants.

Dr. Carlson, who by this time is
probably recognized as tournament
director, stated that the extension of
good fellowship is the primary pur-
pose of the tourney and that tech-
nique is of secondary importance.

All freshman basketball candidates
may participate although actual frosh
practice will not open until after
Thanksgiving. Varsity practice be-
gins October 19.

8-Game Schedule i

Varsity Cross-CountrV'Team
Prepares For Opener
With Daily Sessions

Now that two weeks of practice
are under their spikes, Coach Carl
Olson’s varsity cross-country team is
beginning to chug over the hills and
valleys of the Schenley Park course
with a trot that is only called a dog-
trot because they use their dogs.
That stride will continue to pick up
speed in the next few weeks as the
season draws closer to the starting
line.

According to the schedule that Carl
Olson has packed away in his hip
pocket, eight matches will constitute
the varsity’s cross-country season.’
The opening is still far enough away
to give the harriers a chance to de-
velop a second or even a third wind.
October 17th is the opening date
with Waynesburg College from down
the valley as the competition.

One Week later, Notre Dame, which
is now the all-around Pitt athletic
rival, will send its long striding run-
ners across the Schenley Park course
with the -Olsonmen running right bo-
side them, or possibly right in front.
That date is October 24.

First pullman stop for the Pitt
runners will be out in the prairie
state of Indiana where Butler fur-
nishes the opposition in a cross-coun-
try duel. This is scheduled one week
after the Irish encounter, on October
31. Penn State, defeated by one
point, 27-28, last year, will come back
to Schenley Park on November 9.

High point of the harrier season
comes on November 16 when Pitt
sends its team to the IC4A meet.
Against .'he nation’s best runners
last year, Pitt placed fo-urth.’ An
even better showing seems imminent
this year. _

Anti-climax will be the final match‘
at Annapolis, the home of the United

All through the game there was a
secret yen for an Ohio Wesleyan
tackler to tear a Panther’s trousers,
just so we could yell, “Your Panther
down!”

Cass Announces Program For Year;

‘Cock Robin’ Tryouts Begin Next Week

Carl B. Cass, director of the Pitt
Players, announced yesterday that
he has set next Friday, October 2,
as the last day for new people to
1-e_«.>;ister for tryouts.

Mr. Cass said that he has decided
to conﬁne his casts to registered
Pitt players who have tried out this
year or who have had successful
auditions during a previous year. He
will follow this policy in all four of
the plays to be produced this year.

The first play, “Cock Robin,” by
Philip Barry and Elmer Rice, was
originally scheduled for production

last April, but the untimely interven-
tion of the ﬂood forced a postpone-
ment until an early fall date. The
members of the cast who worked on
the play last spring and who are
still in school will retain their origi-
nal parts.

The parts which were originally
given to Ellis Tumpson, Joseph Mad-
den, Ola McGrail, Joseph Wasel, and
John Baker, who have graduated or

.left school, will be cast early next

week so that rehearsals may be start-
ed for the production which
scheduled for October 21 and 22.
