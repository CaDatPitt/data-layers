_ Congressmen propose

corporate regulations

PITTSBURGH (AP) —— Two
western Pennsylvania congress-
men Wednesday introduced pro-
posed legislation to prevent
investment firms and foreign
bank holding companies from
pursuing corporate takeovers of
other companies‘. '

U.S. Rep. Doug Walgren, D-
Pa., and U.S. Rep. Tom Ridge, R-
Pa., said their proposal stemmed
from a $1.7 billion takeover bid
for the Pittsburgh-based Koppers
Co. Inc. by BNS Inc., a takeover
company formed by British in-
dustrialist Brian C. Beazer, Shear-
son Lehman Hutton Inc. and
National Westminster Bank PLC.

They said their bill would pro-
hibit a financial services compa-
ny that owns a federally insured
bank from taking more than a 5
percent equity interest in a com-
pany not involved in financial
services.

Shearson owns Boston Safe
Deposit and Trust Co., which

ranks as the nation's’ 20th largest
bank. It also owns nearly 50 per-
cent in BNS. J

The Ridge-Walgren bill also

"would prohibit a foreign bank-

holding company that owns a
federally insured bank from using
its financial resources to acquire
interest in a company not en-
gaged in financial services.—

”If investment banks are per-
mitted to become full partners in
takeover efforts through an equi-
ty interest — that is, to go beyond
the traditional role of lending
money — corporate America will
be controlled by banks at un-
precedented leveIs," Walgren
said.

The bill is expected to be
referred to the U.S. House Bank-
ing Committee, Wa|gren’s office
said. Ridge serves on that com-
mittee.

U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.,
has introduced similar legislation
in the Senate. '

Soviets reinforce Afghanistan

By Bryan Brumley

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) —— The
Soviet Union, on the verge of
signing an agreement calling for
the withdrawal of its forces from
Afghanistan, sent 15,000 more
troops plus armored vehicles into
that country, administration
sources said Wednesday. J

The troops were sent across the
border within the past week, said
U.S. intelligence sources who
have been monitoring the fight-
ing. Their sources spoke on con-
dition that they not be further
identified.

At the same time, the Soviet
troops were dispatched, the
sources said, Soviet armored
units already in Afghanistan
moved south from Kabul to
relieve the beleaguered city of

_ Gardez.
These units consisted of an un— E
1. __determined number of soldiers

and 420 vehicles, including T—72
tanks, armored personnel carriers
and mobile rocket launchers.
The increased activity was
reported the day before the

Soviets were expected to sign as
guarantors of a United Nations
agreement on the withdrawal of
the Red Army from Afghanistan.

Gardez is 80 miles south of
Kabul and 60 miles from the
Pakistani border.

Mujahedeen guerrillas recent-
ly cut the road to Gardez, where
a Soviet special forces, or spets—
naz, regiment is garrisoned, said
one source.

Some analysts said they believe
the Soviets will withdraw the
spetsnaz unit to Kabul as they be-
gin to withdraw the Red Army
from Afghanistan.

The advancing column and the
spetsnaz regiment are also ex-
pected to attack stockpiles of
guerrilla armaments.

U.S. intelligence analysts were
divided as to why the Soviets sent
the 15,000 additional soldiers to
Afghanistan. Some suggested
they were sending in more elite
combat units to replace engineers

in their occupation force, estimat- .

ed to total 120,000.

Other analysts, in the adminis-
tration and on Capitol Hill, fear
the Soviets will heavily fortify the

IFC holds awards

By Erik Kridle

staff writer

Excellence among Pitt fraterni-
ties and sororities was recognized
last night at the Second Annual
Greek Chapter Awards Banquet.

A first-place trophy was
presented to the brothers of Del-
ta Tau Delta for their first-place
chapter service project in which

they raised $24,000 for the
1 Western Pennsylvania School for

the Blind. The chief fund-raising
sorority was Delta Delta Delta
which succeeded in raising

$11,500 for the Blind School.

Awards were given in the
categories of academics, alumni
programming, fraternity educa-
tion, social programming and ath-
Ietics.

IFC President Charles Farinel-
la said the awards program was
first conducted last year by form-
er IFC president Jim Sluck.

”Before the initiation of the
banquet,” Farinella explained,
”awards were handed out in a
formal fashion.”

This year's recipient of the
overall All-Sports trophy was Sig-

area around the capital city of
Kabul and the northern
provinces, adjacent to the Soviet
Union, where Afghanistan's rich
natural gasfields are located.

Under the withdrawal agree-
ment, the Soviets are supposed to
pull out 50 percent of their troops
within 90 days, and U.S. analysts
believe the Red Army will pull
back from exposed positions and
concentrate in Kabul and around
the northern city of Mazar-i-
Shanf

Most U.S. analysts believe that
the Kremlin-backed regime head-
ed by Najib will collapse during
or after the Soviet withdrawal, the
intelligence sources said. The
withdrawal is supposed to be
completed by Feb. 15, 1989, but
the United States wants it finished
earlier, they said.

But the collapse of the Kremlin-
backed government ”may not be
as imminent as we thought be-
fore,” said one source. The Af-
ghgan guerrillas are thought to be
divided and may not be strong

Assistant News Editor

Mary Ellen Callahan, a Pitt
sophomore, got an incredible
surprise last Thursday when
she talked to her mother on
the phone. Her mother in-
formed her that a letter she
had just received named Mary
Ellen as a 1988 recipient of a
Truman Scholarship.

”I’m ecstatic,” said Calla-
han. ”I was so surprised. I wor-
ried myself so much [about the
interview], it_didn’t really mat-
ter anymore once I got there.
I didn't care, I think that really
helpe. .”

Applicants, who must be
sophomores, were judged on
their academic record, an es-
say, and an interview. Approx-

imately 1000 students applied
initially. Over two hundred
students were selected for the
second stage of the selection
process of which the interview
was a part. After the interview,
the field was narrowed down f
to one applicant from each
state (including Washington,
D.C. and Puerto Rico) along
with 52 students at—Iarge. Each
of the 104 students was given
an appointment.

”I don't know which
[category] I am,” Callahan
said, ”but it doesn't really
matter.”

Callahan will receive up to
$7,000 each year duringher
last two years of undergradu-
ate studies and her first two
years of graduate or profes-
sional study.

Student nationally recognized

Callahan said the worst part
of the process was writing the
600 word essay. Her topic was
on the American immigration
policy.

She said, ’’All I wanted to
get to was the interview. I do
better in person than on paper.
I figured, if they take me, they
take me; if they don't, they
don't. I just wanted to defend
myself.”

Both the essay and the inter-
view reflected upon Calla-
han’s experience this past
summer as an intern to both
Senator Arlen Spector from
Pennsylvania and Senator
Alan Simpson from Wyoming
(who serves as both Minority
Whip and a member of the
Subcommittee on Immigration

Hijacked

ALGIERS, Algeria —— Algerian
officials Wednesday boarded a
hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet and
began negotiations with Shiite
Moslem gunmen who killed two
people and were holding about
35 others hostage.

A delegation of Kuwaiti offi-
cials arrived in Algiers to help in
the effort to free the plane, which
was hijacked April 5 on a flight
from Bangkok to Kuwait with 112
people aboard. The Boeing 747
left Larnaca, Cyprus, Tuesday
night after 12 more hostages were
freed and flew to Algiers.

Fifty-seven others were
released earlier when the plane
was on the ground in Mashhad,
northeastern Iran.

The hijackers are demanding
that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
extremists convicted in the 1983
bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait. Kuwait has
rejected the demand.

 

One of the 12 freed passengers
said the gunmen got new
weapons when the plane was in
Mashhad. Ramadan Ali, who
holds dual U.S.—Egyptian citizen-
ship, spoke in an interview in Lar-
naca with NBC-TV’s Today.

”They changed the crew, you
know, their team,” said Ali. ”One
of them left  and another two
guys came over . . and they
provided them with new
weapons  and bombs  and
ropes  and explosives.”

Reagan says he didn't
know about quotes

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said Wednesday he was
not aware until recently that his
former spokesman, Larry
Speakes, had attributed state-
ments to him that he did not
make.

Reagan, answering a question

ASSOCIATED PRESS

at a meeting of the American So-
ciety of Newspaper Editors, also
branded a new book by Speakes,
in which he describes the prac-
tice, a ”kiss-and-te|l” volume of
”fiction.” 7

His remarks conflicted with a
statement by Speakes, in an inter-
view on Tuesday, that after
fabricating the quotations he told
the president that he had done so.

The president was asked by
ASNE President Katherine Fan-
ning, editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, whether he ap-
proved of what Speakes says he
did.

’’I was not aware of that and
just learned of it recently as all of
the rest of you did, and I can tell
you right now that l have no af-

fection for these kiss-and-tell
books that are being written and
I find it entirely fiction,” he said.
Reagan also made an oblique
reference to the Speakes con-
troversy in a speech to the editors
before he answered questions.
After referring to a previous
speech that he had made, Reagan
said, ”That’s one of the nice
things about this job. You get to
quote yourself shamelessly, and
if you don't, Larry Speakes will.”

’’I learned so much working
on the Immigration Commit-
tee,” said Callahan. ’’In fact, I
learned so much about the
state itself.”

Callahan said that during the
interview, she was asked
about working with Senator
Spector. She said that she ”...
didn't really like Spectorfs
style as a politician,” but has
”a lot of respect for him now
after the Bork hearings.”

”I followed the whole thing
[Bork hearings] so closely,”
said Callahan.

This fall, Callahan will be
traveling to the University of
Copenhagen in Denmark to
study liberal arts. She will be
focusing on international rela-
tions and be taking classes on
European perspective in the
world. She is traveling through
Pitt's Denmark International
Studies Organization.

Callahan said that along
with her stay in Denmark, she
will also spend one to two
weeks in the Soviet Union.
The trip is funded by the Tru-
man Scholarship but is not
part of the benefits of the
scholarship itself.

Callahan is a Chancellor's _

She hopes someday to be in

For The Pitt News

Renowned authors and pub-
lishers will gather at Pitt to rev-
eal their techniques of fiction
writing and publishing as part of
a ”Paperback Writer” conference
scheduled on May 7.

According to Margie Fusco,
conference coordinator, the pur-
pose of the conference is to give
all aspiring novelists or ”closet
writers” an opportunity to meet
and talk with many reputable
authors, editors and agents.

Those invited to speak at the
conference will speak on subjects

ranging from publishing
problems to market trends.
The conference is co-

sponsored by Pitt's Informal Pro-
gram,‘ Romance Writers of Penn-
sylvania and Pennwriters, a
newly formed statewide group of
writers affliated with Romance
Writers of America.

Fusco, a Pitt alumni and co-
founder of Pennwriters, attended
Pitt's Writing Conference, held
last March and said that ”[the

event] didn't have a great amount
of romance writing.

Lee Gutkind, chairman of Pitt's
English Writing department and
coordinator of last year's Pitt writ-
ing conference said that the En-
glish Writing department will not
sponsor a writer's conference this
year. ”It’s just not an annual
thing,” he said.

Fusco said that since Pitt is not
sponsoring a writer's conference
this year, ”It was a perfect
chance” to organize the ”Paper—
back Writer's Conference.”

Fusco also said that she and a
group of other ”romance” and
fiction writers planned the confer-
ence over the past year and a
half.

According to Fusco, ”Michael
Chabon brought a lot of attention
to Pittsburgh” and thus opened
up the market for Pittsburgh
writers.

Michael Chabon, a former Pitt
student, has just recently had his
first novel, The Mysteries of Pitts-
burgh published and has been
offered a film contract for the
book.

Fusco said that ”a lot of people
in the publishing industry are be-
ginning to realize that Pittsburgh
is an untapped market of
writers.” She also stated that ”this
is the one time that people in
Pittsburgh will get a chance to
meet some of the top people in
the publishing industry to im-
prove their chance of of selling
their novels.”

The conference features a word
processing demonstration, a me-
dia presentation on publishing
from Harlequin, genres of popu-
lar fiction and tips from profes-
sional writers. Suspense,
adventure, romance, historical,
science fiction and mainstream
genres will also be represented.

Among the speakers are near-
ly two dozen published authors,
agents and editors from New
York publishing houses.

Speakers include Pitt alumni
Fredda lsaacson, vice-president
and senior. editor for Warner
Books and bestselling author
Molly Cochran.

Susan Anderson, president of
Pennwriters, encourages writers
to attend the conference ”he-

cause writing is a business and
the author who is going to get it
published is the one who knows

the market and trend.” she said.
Nancy Martin, an author and

speaker at the conference,
remembers her first writer's con-
ference. ’’I took a big swallow
and walked into the hotel ball-
room, and I saw 200 romance
novelists looking exactly like I did
in their polyester suits,” she said.
’’I realized I wasn't alone, but
here were all these women that
did what I ;id, they came to New
York to learn to become profes-
sional. ‘

”Writer’s conferences are the 0

perfect place for publishers to
find that undiscovered author
who's going to make them mil-
lions,” added Martin.

Private interviews can be ar-
ranged during the conference
with an editor or agent for
manuscript consultation.

The seminar costs $42 per per-
son, which includes continental
breakfast and lunch. To register,

Dogs and cats will

benefit at fundraiser °

by Keri D. Smith
Staff Writer

The Mobilization for Animals,
a group designed to protect
animal rights, is kicking off
”World Week for Laboratory
Animals” with a fund—raiser to
raise the consciousness of the
Pittsburgh community to the
plight of animals.

The event will be held at the
Pittsburgh Brewing Co. on April
21, 1988.

”|t’s a fund—raising party,” said
Pat Knezevich, the fundraising
chairperson for Mobilization for
Animals.

The fundraiser will cost $5 per
person, and the Pittsburgh Brew-
ing Co. will be supplying beer
and other refreshments at no ex-
tra charge to participants. To
stimulate greater interest, the
fund—raiser will include door
prizes, free caricatures, Tarot card
readings and handwriting
analyses.

According to Knezevich,
Mobilization for Animals is a
non—profit organization staffed by
volunteers. Knezevich said that
the group was at the U.S. Steel
Building protesting H.J. Heinz
products because she said that
the indiscriminate killing of dol-
phins by tuna boats just for tuna
was ”not right.” She said that
people don't know much about
the potential of dolphins, and that
killing them without fully know-
ing their usefulness wasn't
justifiable.

facts,” continued Knezevich.
”We can only say,’hey, look —
we are wiping out dolphins here
and we know nothing about
them.’ What if man had been
wiped out by dinosaurs thou-
sands of years ago? We’re wiping
them [dolphins] out all for a can

of tuna. We have to ask our—_

selves: ’do we have the right?’ ”

Knezevich went on to say the
Mobilization for Animals group is
new and that the fund—raiser is for
people who are interested in the
issue of cruelty to animals.
Knezevich feels that animals are
abused and misused because the
human species thinks that it is the
superior species.

Knezevich continued, ”And
there are many questions that are
unanswered and it will always be
that way. I think it all boils down
to our mentality that we are a su-
perior species.”

Knezevich stressed that Mobili-
zation for Animals is not like the
many other animal rights groups;
its main concern is not just cats
and dogs. _

”We protest the use of furs. We
feel that the killing of animals for
vanity is not right. We protest the
use of animals for laboratory pur-
poses — especially for commer-
cial use like mascara and
lipstick,” Knezevich said.

Knezevich has been searching
for grants from well—known foun-
dations in Pittsburgh, but as soon
as she mentions the word
”animal” to any of them, they
want to hang [the phone] up.

Knezevich said that no one
wants to give any money for the
benefit of the animals. She said
that money is needed to get
animals spayed and neutered as
well as to house stray cats and
dogs.

’’I can show you facts that the
Humane Society on the North
Side has to kill 100,000 animals
a year because we don't have any
place to have them spayed or
neutered, and as a result, the in-
nocent suffer. Whether it's a
kitten—life or a chi|d—|ife or a
puppy—life, the innocent always
suffer.”

Knezevich said that the upcom—
ing fund raiser for Mobilization
for Animals is going to be more
of a social gathering than people
trying to force their opinions on
others.

Knezevich also said that on
April 30, there will be a confer-
ence of Mobilization for Animals
at Community College on the
North Side. The April_30 confer-
ence will also include a vegetar-
ian lunch. The fee for this
conference is $15.

Candidates should
have learned to read

On April 23, Mike Dukakis and Jesse Jackson will attend a
debate at the Steel Valley high school. Each of the seven groups
involved in organizing the event were permitted to draft one
question each for the candidates to address.

These questions have already been sent to the participants.
Abnother victory to the apparent opponents of real-time in-

tellegence. \

Maybe, it has been found in a survey that when the candi-
dates have the questions before hand, there are better quotes
from the debate. Truly, a study in enforced stupidity.

When we are involved in the selection of one of the major
players in the farce that has come to be known as American
politics, it would seem wise to get a feeling for the candidate's
reaction to a problem his staff hasn't had a week to study. Hind-
sight, we have been told, lends the most perfect vision. Fore-
thought is second best. Then, bringing up the rear, there is the
difficulty of dealing with the present as it comes.

Certainly it is in the best interests of the candidates to have
to prepare an opinion before a debate. However, it would be
much more productive to examine the ability of the candidates
to react to a new situation than their ability to read and memo-
rize. Those skills are best learned in grammer school, not dur-

ing a campaign forpresident.

In a nutshell 

There are two ways to slide easily through life: to believe everything and
to doubt everything. Both ways save us from thinking.

Bush on the bandwagon

What happens when Novem-
ber comes around and we have
to choose between Mike Dukakis
and George Bush for President?
It's a question, I feel, of no small
import.

On the Republican hand, Bush
has certainly had an ample op-
portunity to observe the workings
of the post of president — ample
because he seems to have done
very little else. I think we can
probably take it as read that Bush
has gotten a rather extensive edu-
cation in the machinations of the
White House.

However, I have to wonder
what the value of that education
is. The mentor was Ronald Rea-
gan. The role models included
Edwin Meese, Elliot Abrams,
Oliver North and William Casey,
surely a cast which would do
justice to the best Hollywood Big
Brotheresque movie.

Then, turning away from the
White Elephants, we find our-
selves confronted by Michael

MATTHEW
THORNTON

Dukakis. He's not an inspiring
man, that much is certain, but
Ronald Reagan was inspiring.

Dukakis has had no real~ex-
perience with foreign policy, or
with the size of audience he
would be confronted with in the
Oval Office. He has done fairly
well playing to small crowds, but
theatre that works well in an inti-
mate setting often loses itseffec—
tiveness on a larger stage.

The Massachusetts Miracle, a
financial program met by rave
reviews from nearly all quarters,
is persuasive evidence for the
managerial skills in Dukakis’ pos-
session.

However, without the ability to
incite some emotion in a large
crowd, he is going to have a
difficult time pushing any similar

measure through Congress. Bruce
Babbitt showed us that the mes-
sage is often less important than
the politics it embraces.

People in the Bush camp are
quite fond of citing statistics and
campaign strategies for Novem-
ber. There is an attitude of "damn
the people, look at the poll
returns" that is very dishear-
tening. I

Which, of course, is not to say
that the Dukakis team is not
equally guilty of shaping the mes-
sage to fit the numbers, but at
least they do it in their own
offices, not on the campaign trail.

It seems to me that a man so
proud of his political acumen as
George Bush, a man so proud of
his political lineage, must have
dreadfully little else to say.

We've had enough of that sort
of vacuous leadership. A

Matthew Thornton is the per-
spective editor for The Pitt News.

Losing it on the I 1th floor of Western Psych.

WALKING BY MOONLIGHT

The following is true, only the
subject's name has been
changed.

Tom is a 22-year-old former Pitt
student. He's been out of school
since December. He decided to
take a year off ”to get my head
together.” -

Many students decide to take
time off, but Tom's story is a lit-
tle different than most.

In November, 1986, Tom
could look down from his room
and watch the goings-on in Oak-
land. He could look, but couldn't
participate. Tom's room was on
the IIth_floor of Western Psych.

Earlier that month, Tom had
committed himself to the hospi-
tal after a suicide attempt, his
third that year.

”I was diagnosed with a unipo-
lar affective disorder —— my brain
couldn't properly utilize the neu-
rotransmitter norepenepherine —
in lay terms, I was suicidally
depressed.”

While in the hospital, he was
prescribed an anti-depressant

PAUI. ANATER

medication, which made him feel
so much better that ”my suicidal
ideation went away. I had been
suicidal for years, at least since
high school, and it was just
gone/' '

He was released from Western
Psych. on Dec. 1, and immedi-
ately went to his parents’ home
to rest up. '’I felt great. I felt that
I was ready to take on anything
at that point, but I wasn't really
exposed to anything, I didn't
have to deal with any real stress.
I guess I was lulled into a false
sense of sanity.”

He was more than ready to
take on the world when he
returned to Pitt for the Winter
term.

As soon as he walked back into
his apartment, "The bottom just
fell out. I was standing in the
livingroom of my apartment, star-
ing at the blood stains on the

couch. It was my blood, and the
hell I'd gone through two months
ago came rushing back.”

His ’’false sense of sanity,” was
wrong, he realized. ”The drug
was treating’ my brain, but it
couldn't do anything for my
mind.” A

”I was seeing a psychiatrist
once a week, and I expected that
just talking about stuff would
make it better. I guess I was just
being naive.

”Things weren't getting better,
I was falling into the same ruts I
was when I was sick. I started to
get bitter, I mean really bitter. Fi-
nally, I stormed out of my shrink's
office, and took myself off of my
medication. I just drifted and
brooded for about two months af-
ter that.”

"I really dwelt on it. I mean
openly. I saw myself as a victim,
only I couldn't tell who the at-

tacker was. I went from bitterness
to anger. I mean hell, ‘if depres-
sion is chronic illness, why
should I even try to cope with it?’
I used to tell myself.”

He finally snapped out of it
when a friend called him on his
tragic pose. "Stop using it as an
excuse, everybody has to deal
with something, you're no differ-
ent,” the friend told Tom.

"That was when I figured out
that my recovery was in my
hands, no one e|se's. I was back
at rock bottom, and I saw that
Steve [the friend] wasn't the only
one who was sick of pitying me.

'’I took a long walk through the
park that night. I did a lot of cry-
ing and screaming, but more im-
portantly, I did a lot of thinking.”

He goes on, ”That night, I ad-
mitted the root of my problem —
I had no self-esteem. My
problems were a result of my lack
of self-love, and my lack of self-
love made my problems even
worse. Self-esteem is the most im-
portant aspect of your personali-
ty. If you don't love yourself,

you're nothing.”

But how do you get self-
esteem?

"Wel|, I don't have a clear an-
swer for that, but for me it came
from seizing control of my life.
When I began to praise myself for
the good things instead of blam-
ing myself for the bad, things real-
ly started to click."

Tom says that he re-examined
every aspect of his life and kept
what he wanted, and threw away
what he didn't.

”It’s been a long road back, but
all that matters is that I'm here.
I'm not as angry as I used to be,
because now I understand that
who I am today is the total of
everything that's ever happened
to me. I don't look at my Western
Psych. days very fondly, but if it
weren't for them, I wouldn't be
who I am.

”There’s a whole lot of people
that are out there who've been
through similar problems; I just
wish I would have known that
earlier.” I

What shoulds e do abouther
son and the girl next door?

Q: I went into our garage to get

something and found my son, 10,
with the neighbor's daughter, 13,
in a compromising situation.
Who‘ was compromising with
whom was a question, since she
is older and she was giving him
the manual stimulation. I picked
"up the first thing that came to
hand, which was not what I went
there for and walked out saying
nothing and looking as if I, had
not seen them.

A number of questions have
come to mind. Should I speak to
him about this? Isn't he too
young for this kind of thing? Can
he ejaculate at his age? Does this
kind of thing encourage or inhibit
sexual development? Can it be
bad for him? Should I talk it over
with the girl's mom and dad?
Should I tell my husband?

A: Say nothing to anyone. I
don't say to encourage more of
the same, but one occurrence
that you happened to see is not
a thing to raise a storm about.
Your son is young to have a com-
plete sexual experience. I doubt
that he can ejaculate — that
comes with the secondary sexu-
al characteristics like voice
changing, chin fuzz, body hair. A
prepubescent boy canstimulate
himself, or be stimulated, and this
can produce pleasurable sensa-

tions. He may even have an or- «

gasm -— but without ejaculation.
This kind of activity won't
strengthen or enlarge him sexu-
ally, the way exercise and
muscle-building affect physique.
It won't harm him, either.

Don't tell the girl's parents -
raising her is their concern. But
if you ever see her doing some-
thing dangerous, such as using al-
cohol or drugs or having sex with
an adolescent boy, then let some-
body know. I

Since you ask me if you should
tell your husband, I sort of hear
that you are afraid he will make
a big deal of it. If that is the case,
I would not tell him. On the other
hand, if this boy's father has a
good record for keeping calm
and sensible about things, if you

usually talk everything over
together in an amicable way, go
ahead, but ask your husband to
keep quiet, neither scolding nor
kidding the boy about this.

Q: lam a nice woman, 64, and
I look much younger. I fell for a
married man some time ago. No
intimacy took place and I have
tried to put him out of my mind.’
But he stays in my heart no mat-
ter how I try to stop thinking
about him. What can I do?

A: In your mind or your heart
is OK; just keep him out of your
bed. And avoid seeing him unless
it is unavoidable, because who
knows what happens when peo-
ple let their guard down just to be
friends? To put him out of your
mind is impossibleso don't wear
yourself out trying, but put in
your mind that he is attractive,
nice, you have been in love with
him, he is good for daydreams
and fantasies if you pleasure
yourself sometimes, but you are
keeping his hands off you — and
your hands off this other wom-
an's husband. That can take root
in your mind, too. Keep it there.
Don't blame yourself. Just do the
right thing and sleep soundly. In-
time he will take a less prominent

placein your thoughts.

Q: My high school sweetheart,
Class of 1927, has become a
widower, an old friend from my
home town tells me. I have been
widowed with time on my hands
for some years. Certainly my chil-
dren leave me with plenty of time
to fill up. I want to write Lover
Boy with definite intentions of
reviving old feelings. Do I write
a letter of condolence, after 50
years of silence? That seems a lit-
tle transparent. I don't want to
condole, I want to sail into the
sunset with him.

A: Well, you can't tell him how
delighted you are that he is free.
One sentence of condolence will
be required, decent and ap-
preciated. More may well seem
insincere. After that one sen-I
tence, write a letter full of news
and expressing the wish to see
him again —— before, not after,
that sunset. In that sentence of
condolence; say you heard about
his loss and you wish him
strength because you have been
there yourself and know that
strength is needed.

Then talk about yourself and at
the end say you would be happy
if he would call you and you
could have lunch together. Make
it lunch — if you make it dinner
it will look too much like seduc-
tion. When you go to that lunch,
prepare yourself for the possibil-
ity that he already has a girlfriend.

PBT repertoire

By Cathleen Karlsson
Staff Writer

It's hard to believe that Pitts-
burgh Ballet Theatre's mainstage
1987-88 season is coming to an
end. The company has offered its
audiences so many beautifully
composed performances, includ-
ing their own world premieres of
ballets which can be recognized
as major accomplishments for
PBT.

From this past season, we can
see the maturity of the company's
repertoire — it has earned them
national recognition. As PBT’s Ar-
tistic Director Patricia Wilde stat-
ed, ”we grow the most when we
overcome our greatest
challenges." With an attitude like
that, one can easily understand
why PBT’s image has improved
— the dancers have striven to bet-
ter themselves. Last week's per-
formances are proof of this
progression.

The company performed
Balanchine's Scotch Symphony,
Paul Taylor's Mercuric, Tidings
and Harold Lander’s Etudes. Each
work expressed the individual
choreographer’s representations
of ballet, ranging from the tradi-

tional fluidity of classical dance
(as in Scotch Symphony and
Etudes), to the exuberance of
modern dance (in Mercuric
Tidings).

Scotch Symphony captured the
lightheartedness of ’’Highland’’
dance, mixed with eloquent clas-
sical ballet. The liveliest role of
the piece was that of the ”Scotch
Lass” portrayed by Dana Lewis.
Her petite figure and quick
moves made her appear to be
flame sprite on the stage.

In contrast, the romantic sec-
tion of the ballet, between the
sylph and the Scotsman — played
by Tamar Rachelle and Scott
Jovovich —— brought the audience
to a dreamlike state of romantic
tranquility.

Mercuric Tidings exhibited a
much different approach with its
high—energy, nontraditional
movements. The costumes
helped develop the theme, as
well. They resembled a fiery es-
sence which seemed to hop
about the stage as the dancers ex-
ecuted the flighty steps.

Etudes showed the audience
the creating of a dancer, starting
with the first five positions and
continuing on to the demands
made by the repertoires on prin-

matures as season progresses

ciple dancers. The company dis-
played tedious barre work, turns

-and leaps across the floor, show-

ing the evolution of their strength
and technique.

Throughout the performances it
was noticeable that, at times, the
dancers appeared to be fatigued.
But since this did not seem to
hinder their performances or
make the presentations any less
spectacular, it may be logical to
assume that they were truly giv-
ing each step careful and precise
attention.

That means that audiences can

9 look forward to the same dedica-

tion in this week's productions of
Valse Fantaisie with the Minkus
Pas de Trois, Petrouchka and
Theme and Variations. Also, the
April 14 performances will be
shared by a Pas de Deux danced
by Irina Nestorova and Igor
Yurlov, the two Soviet guest per-
formers brought to Pittsburgh by
the Pennsylvania Peace Links
project.

If the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's
season must come to an end,
there is no better way than to
promise its audience that next
season will be something special
to look forward to.

Unless you've been hibernat-
ing underneath a well insulated
shag rug, you've undoubtedly
heard of the Affordable Floors in
conjunction with Pittsburgh's
newest music — and with very

- good reason.

Last year, their debut album
The Sounding took the city, at
least in the ”progressive” parts,
by storm. The band attracted a
large following, drawing
hundreds at their live shows, and
a couple of tracks from their al-
bum were hits at both WPTS and
WXXP.

Now, a year after The Sound-
ing’s release, the Affordable
Floors are still raising the roof off
the local music scene. Just last
Monday, for the second year in
a row, the band won ”Best Local

, Band” honors in WXXP’s New
Music Awards. There is a flurry
of excitement surrounding the
upcoming release of their new al-
bum, Drumming on the Walls.

The band has undergone a line-

up change over the year. Origi-
nal guitarist Steve Morrison left
the group in November to pursue
other interests. He is currently the
guitarist for Fusebox. After an ex-
tensivesearch, the band selected
Eric Hertzog for the role of lead

guitarist. Along with newcomer \

Hertzog, the Floors are keybor—
dist and vocalist Harvey Coblin,
keyboardist Kirk Botula, bassist
Eric Riebling and drummer Ken
Zenkevich.

Drumming on the Walls is al-
ready causing a stir in the musi-
cal community. WPTS has started
playing choice cuts, and WXXP
has recently featured the band
and their new music on ”Neigh—
borhood Spotlight.”

In order to give you a taste of
Drumming on the Walls, local
music personalities have agreed
to share their opinions.

John Young — Assistant Mus-
ic Director, WPTS:

The Affordable Floors’ second
LP, Drumming on the Walls, out-
distances their first by emphasiz-
ing the band’s many strengths.
Eric Riebling’s quick, melodic
bass playing and Ken Zenkevich’s
dynamic drumming are particu-
larly prominent in the mix this
time. .

As well, Harvey Cob|in’s ever-
expanding vocal range is put to
good use, hitting the highs of
’’Berkeley Square,” the lows of
”Ca|m Without a Storm” and the
rapid—fire phrasing of ”Wedding

Which witch is the good witch and why?

A“ By Patricia Lomando White

Staff Writer

Just about everyone can say
that, at one time or another in
their lives, they've been a little
greedy or vengeful. In Arthur
Miller's The Crucible, we see
how these frailties of the human
char en unleashed en-
masse c destroy human ideals

‘ﬁnd societies.

Written in response to McCar-

thyism, the play is about the peo-
ple of Salem, Massachusetts and
how the Witch Trials, held in
1692, affected their lives.

The play opens with the sound
of a cricket heard in the back-
ground as two candles softly light
the dark stage. A group of young
girls dance about what appears to
be a steaming kettle, as a black
woman kneeling before it sways
to and fro, chanting. As the ritual

progresses, the group appears to .

have made contact with spirits.
There is a scream and the scene
is over. '

These young girls, like curious,
young girls of any era, are toying
with something unknown and

, forbidden to them. The darkness

symbolizes the unknown, and

the scream symbolizes the terror
of that unknown and the horror
of what is to come.

At the back of the stage there
are rows of chairs on risers. In the
next scene, actors dressed in Pu-
ritan clothing stand before them,
together speaking the play’s nar-
ration. As they speak, three wom-
en, dressed in black and wearing
masks, dance about the stage.
These women are rumor, venge-
ance and greed. While the actors
represent a jury standing in
judgement over their peers, the
masked women represent the de-
mons hidden in everyone.

Central to the play is the rela-
tionship between John and

Elizabeth Proctor andtheir re|a—t

tionship, to Abigail Williams. Abi-
gail is orphaned and lives with
her uncle, Reverend Parris. At
one time, before the play begins,
she worked for the Proctors be-
cause Elizabeth was ill. While
working there she had an affair
with John. Elizabeth, upon dis-
covering this, threw her out.

In the meantime, Reverend Par-
ris can't awaken his daughter_af-

ter her night of dancing in the
woods and has called in
Reverend John Hale, who is
known for his ability to unearth
witches. Because of ignorance
and superstition, these people
turn to witches for an explanation
of the unknown.

Riding the crest of the wave of
fear and turmoil created by the
witch hunts, Abigail seizes the
opportunity to destroy those
whom she feels have wronged
her. She accuses Elizabeth of be-
ing a witch and thus punishes
John for his indiscretion and his
disinterest in her.

This character doesn't care
whom she destroys. Her venge-
ance drives her to bring many of
her neighbors to trial to achieve
her revenge and to lend credibil-
ity to her story.

To emphasize the timelessness
of the play’s theme, several actors
appear in modern day dress.
Also, a cabbage patch doll is used
to represent the puppet made by
one of the girls.

Another dramatic touch can be
seen in the costuming. Bits of red

fabric are sewn on the clothes of
cast members who are responsi-
ble for condemning innocent
people. This signifies that they
wear the blood of their victims.

Anne Louise Bannon, as Abi-
gail Williams, skillfully plays a
determined young girl who ap-
pears to be both innocent and
wicked. On the other hand,
Camille Hallstrom, as Elizabeth
Proctor, shows a quiet inner-
strength while exuding purity and
goodness.

Providing some comic relief is
Willard Korth as Giles Corey. He
is humorous and likeable. While
Kenneth Roberts, in the role of
John Proctor, creates moving
scenes that evoke empathy from
the audience, Daniel Frezza as
Deputy—Govenor Danforth is the
man you love to hate.

The production is handled well
by Scott DeNier, whose direction
is both inventive and thought-
provoking. Although there are
some slow moments, the tension
created by the frenzied cries of
”witches” keeps the play
moving.

Michael Chabon
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh

Morrow

Undoubtedly, you've heard all
the hype surrounding Pitt gradu-
ate Michael Chabon’s novel The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh. Most of
the noise has to do with how
great his prose is (the next J.D.
Salinger) and how much money
he received in advance
($155,000, the largest amount
ever offered for a first novel).

Chabon’s book is set mostly in
Oakland and details Pitt graduate
Art Bechstein’s last summer of
freedom. A brief summary of the
book would go something like
this:

Art (son of Pittsburgh's Jewish
organized crime boss) meets Ar-
thur LeComte (a fancy-dressing
housesitter for Pittsburgh's richer
citizens) and they strike up a

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 14, T988

strong friendship. Arthur then in-
troduces Art to Phlox (a beautiful
girl who wears just a little too
much makeup), and Art falls in
love with her.

Art then meets Arthur’s long-
time friend Cleveland (a pseudo-
biker who collects money for a
loanshark) and they form the od-
dest threesome of characters not
in a Douglas Adams novel.
Somewhere in the middle of the
book, Art falls in love with Arthur
as well and begins to date him as
well as Phlox.

Cleveland then decides its time
to show Art the seamy side of or-
ganized crime, something Art's
father has been trying to keep Art
from getting involved in. Phlox
then gives Art an ultimatum —
her or Arthur, but not both. Art
chooses which one he wants, and
then breaks it off after his father
begins to get involved with Art's

Solving the clues to the Mysteries of Pittsburgh’

friends. Art then moves out of the 

country and the book ends.

‘ Actually, a whole lot more than

that happens, but you get the
general idea of the plot.

‘Most of what has been said of
Mysteries is true. It's a quite en-
gaging tale of a mixed up man
trying to decide what he’s going
to be doing with his future.
Chabon’s prose, something that's

been widely acclaimed, is exce!—Q

lent. Technically speaking, the
language of the book never gets
in the way of the story being told,
and its seeming simplicity adds
flavor not found in most novels
being put out by most modern.
authors.

Unfortunately, the story is just
a litt|e—bit larger than life. While
the various aspects of the story,
taken individually, are believa-

ble, their combination isn't.

Blue Blue Blue: more than just a color scheme

' By Manny Theiner

Staff Writer

Despite the concentration of
music industry moguls in New
York City, bands there have to
struggle just as hard as anywhere
else to be noticed. The various
trends of East Village, art—damage,
noiserock and performance art
have all contributed to the Big

.OApple scene recently and gained

some national attention.

Other groups have chosen to
hang together, as in the case of
the Sorority, an informal associ-
ation of 10 bands who often
share the gigs and are all featured

on the Sorority Sampler compila—
tion with one track apiece. One
of these bands is Blue Blue Blue,
who will perform at the Decade
on Wednesday, April 20.

With the whomping bass and
wailing guitars reminiscent of ear-
ly PiL and maybe newer Killing
Joke, one might think Blue Blue
Blue were headed for instant al-
ternative stardom, but it's not that
simple. A quick listen to ”On the
Moors” from their new cassette
opens a world of dreamy mists

standing with the best slow

material from such bands as
Minimal Compact and Breath-
less. Two sounds, one band -——_a

A certain amount of versatility
is perhaps what causes the band
to shy away from stating obvious
influences on their music, as well
as the fact that every member

”Face it. God is dead; you just
didn't have a suit to wear to the
funeral.”

This was just one of the stabs
the Second City comedy troupe
took at modern life Tuesday night
in the William Pitt Union.

The Second City players —— or
Second Citizens, as they are
sometimes called —— performed
several rehearsed skits as well as
some completely improvised
scenes in their show.

A successful performance re-
quires a verylreceptive audience
to shout out ideas. The troupe
then develops a quickly paced
scene as if they were racing
against the clock. Scripted skits
are developed from these im-
provs and are then worked into
the show.

products. He's also into Edgar Al-
len Poe, the master of gothic liter-
ature. Take it from there.

Not surprisingly, the first label
interested in Blue Blue Blue
turned out to be C’est La Mort
known as the American 4 AD for
its emphasis on the atmospheric
and molasses thick pop sounds of
bands such as Room Nine and
Beautiful Pea Green Boat. Ac-
cording to Wood, Blue Blue Blue
signed with CLM (located in Loui-
siana, of all places) in March and
will release their first record in

September. Wood also empha-
sizes that Blue Blue Blue are
more uptempo in their live
shows, though not adverse to do-
ing slow songs like the un-
released ”Junk Truck”

Blue Blue Blue will not be
planning a mini-tour until Sep-
tember, coinciding with their al-
bum release. The Decade show
is therefore a one—shot, straight
from New York City and back.
Avoid the autumn rush — the
time to see them is now before

the darkness returns.

the Second time

In one of the rehearsed scenes
two comedians pretended to ride
aroller coaster while an off stage
announcer said ”coming this
summer to Hershey Park, The
Stock Market. Ride it if you can."

This is the group's second year
touring together as a troupe. Per-
forming on several college cam-
puses in cities throughout the
U.S. has been like ”a Whitman
Sampler of America,” according
to Citizen Michael McCarthy.

Jill Talley, another member of
the Second City troupe would
like to have more time to see the
cities where the troupe performs.
”We get off a plane and do a
show.” But aside from not being
able to see Pittsburgh, Talley
”had a blast.”

Performer Jane Lynch said that
the troupe was using a new run-
ning order for the first time and
they had the opportunity to use

some of their own skits Tuesday
night. ”We’re still real high on
the new material.”

Gregory Hollimon, another
member of the troupe, also ”felt
good” about the new scenes in
the show.

The new skits included a paro-
dy ofjefferson Airp|ane’s ”White
Rabbit” that the troupe helped to
arrange. The song lampooned the
adverse effect of the Brady Bunch
utopia on American
teenagers.Remember what Alice
said/Make your bed.

l_n keeping with the improv
theme, the Second Citizens use
props and costumes sparingly
and rely on their jokes and move-
ment to keep the audience
laughing.

”We had a good audience,”
said Second Citizen Dave Sinker.
”They were very receptive. l en-

songs makes Drumming on the

1 Walls varied and interesting.

”B|ackout” is a spare, high-tech
sing-along (with a banjo, no
lessl); ”Berkeley Square” is a
moody, Peter Gabriel-esque
song; and ”Only Grey” is just
good, solid, straight-ahead pop.
The melodies are engaging, the
musicianship first rate.

Manny Theiner — Program
Director, WRCT:

There is a definite Peter Gabriel
sound to this, especially in ”Wait-
ing.” In ”The Red Room,” I heard
the baseline from the Peanuts
theme. This album also sounds a
little more like Level 42. It may

become popular with the dance
crowd. It's very professional and
has a commercial flavor that may
attract major recording labels. It's
ironic that this album (produced
by Al Snyder and the Affordable
Floors) is so much better
produced than The Sounding,
which was done by Zapple Enter-
tainment.

Phil Harris — Hector in Paris:

The first thing that struck me
about the tape is that The Floors
have one of the best rhythm sec-
tions in town, and as on the last
record, they seemed to be mixed
down, with keyboards being the
prominent instruments. Although
this does not detract from the

overall sound, it would be nice
to hear Eric Riebling and Ken
come through a little more.

The keyboard samples seem
fresh and not overly gimmicky,
although, the glockenspiel sound
may be overused on side one.
Harvey's voice is stronger on this
effort and ti is particularly pleas-
ing when he overdubs and sings
his own backups. The guitar is
relegated to basically a rhythm
function, giving warm contrast to
the often cold sound of the syn-
thesizers.

Rod Schwartz — 11th Hour:

1987 ended with the Afforda-
ble Floors facing two tough ques-
tions: 1. Could they replace

Improvs are troupe member
Timothy Meadow’s favorite part

his actions in the story detract
from the sense of humanity other-

This fault, however, does not
seriously detract from the story in

something different every time.”

The Second City has been tak-
ing satirical glances at social, cul-
tural and political life since its
opening in Chicago on Decem-
ber 16, 1959. The concept
caught on quickly, and The Se-
cond City received almost instant

success.
The Second City has fast be-
come an institution, as Clive
Barnes stated in The New York
Times in 1969, ”The entire recent
tradition of American theatrical
satire can be summed up in three
words: ‘The Second City’ .”

departed guitarist Steve Morrison
and 2. Could they top their suc-
cessful debut album, The Sound-
ing. Drumming on the Walls
answers both questions with a re-
sounding YES! New guitarist Eric
Hertzog’s tasteful playing
throughout shows why the band
took so much time searching for
a replacement. They wanted to
find the perfect foil for the crea-
tive twin keyboards of Harvey
Coblin and Kirk Botula. ,, One
listening of Drumming shows
they found the right man.

On Saturday night, the Afford-

able Floors will officially
celebrate the release of Drum-

formances at Graffiti. The first, at
7 pm., is an all-ages show, and
the second is at 10 p.m. for the
over-21 crowd. The Mondays
from Washington, D.C. will be
the opening act for the 10 p.m.
show.

Advance copies of Drumming

night of the show. The album,
which will be only available on
CD and cassette, will hit area
record stores on April 18.

Smith ready to take
on starting role in
young defensive team

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Some feel that defense is what
wins football games.

Pitt won a lot of games last sea-
son because of the efforts of their
defense — a defense that finished
in the top 10 in the country. One
which held Brigham Young to
minus 76 yards rushing. A
defense that completely shut
down a not-so-terrible Rutgers
team — allowing them only 62
yards on the ground, 35 in the air
and a total of eight first downs for
the entire game.

The Panthers lost seven starters
from that defense and will rely on
a youth movement to fill the
holes. .

The defensive line will be
called on a lot this season. One

of those ready for the challenge’
is junior defensive end Carnel“

Smith.

”lf we don't play good defense,
we don't win,” Smith said. “We
have to go out on the field with
the attitude that we have to win
the game. It will make the whole

team that much better. Defense, ,
» is what wins Championships." 5’

Smith only started six games
last season but played in all
twelve. He finished the season
with 48 tackles and three sacks.

”Last season, he alternated a lit-
tle with Jon Carter but played a
lot,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said. ’’I think he really showed a
lot of promise and ended up hav-
ing a good year. I think he is just
going to get better.”

A few weeks ago, the defense
was hit with a bit of bad news.

Defensive tackle Tony Siragusa
will miss the entire 1988 season
after he has knee surgery.
”Anytime you lose a player of
the caliber of a Siragusa, you
have a lot of ground to make up,”
Smith said. ”But the guys filling
in are doing a good job. That's
the difference between a good
team and a great team. With a
great team, there is a player
standing there ready to fill an in-
jured guy’s shoes. When Siragu-

-sa went down, that was the

opportunity for Richard Allen,
Eric Seaman, Tommy Sims and
all the rest of those guys.

”You hate to see a player go
down, but everybody came in
here to play and that's just an op-

portunity for them. We really

hope he can make it back. But
with the quality of guys that we
have in there, it really doesn't be-
come much of a factor."

Smith feels that the competition
to fill Siragusa’s spot will be a
benefit to the team.

”Competition should bring out
the best in all of us,” Smith said.
’’I know it brings out the best i
me. Alot. of our player strive 0%

P‘-of th}e'\eompetitit;zj;r _ 

 
  

‘.

we.-.»look for.” . , .4 ,1

For his part, Smith likes to go
into camp feeling like his job is
secure, but he also likes some-

body pushing him to do better. ,

For Smith, that push makes him
a better part of the team. H”
Smith doesn't see that much of
a problem with the defense.
”That’s what spring ball is for.
Everybody should be getting to
know each other. Coach Gott-

Basketball recruits considering   
all options before picking school

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

0 Although yesterday was na-
tional letter-of—intent day for in-
coming basketball players, the
University of Pittsburgh has yet to
announce the recruitment of any
players.

It's not as if high school seniors
and junior college transfers aren't
interested in Pitt, though. There
are at least seven yet unsigned

T prospects the Panthers are wait-

ing to hear from, and any num-
ber of them could be in a blue

' and gold uniform next season.

0 Heading the list was Brian
Sallier, a 6-8, 230 pound center
from Lincoln High School in Port
Arthur, Texas.

Sallier, who averaged 19
points, 15 rebounds and five
blocked shots last season, an-
nounced yesterday that he will at-
tend Oklahoma.

Sallier reportedly gave a verbal
committment to the Panthers
earlier in the season, according to
a March 23 article in The Beaver
County Times but toldThe Pitt
News last week that he never
gave any indication he would

definitely attend Pitt.

Sallier has yet to score more
than the required 700 on his
SATS, as required by NCAA
Proposition 48.

0 Pitt, however, is in conten-
tion for 6-10 forward Don
MacLean from Simi Valley High
School in Simi Valley, Calif. In
the April 4 issue of The Sporting
News, MacLean was rated as the
best unsigned power forward in
the country. J

MacLean has narrowed his
field of schools down to Pitt, Ge-
orgia Tech, UCLA, UNLV and
Kentucky.

Following the Roundball Clas-
sic at the Civic Arena last week,
MacLean said he was waiting to
see who took over as UCLA
coach before making his de-
cision.

Pepperdine coach Jim Harrick
filled the position yesterday, and
MacLean has apparently decided
to attend either Pitt or Georgia
Tech. He will announce his de-
cision on April 20.

0 Another big man consider-
ing Pitt is Michael Curry, a 6-10
center from Columbia High
School in Decatur, Ga. Curry,

however, is also considering Ten-
nessee, Georgia Tech and Mis-
issippi.

0 Despite the outstanding
class of freshmen Pitt recruited
last year, another guard has ex-
pressed a definite interest in play-
ing for Pitt.

Jason Buchanan, from Nottin-
gham High School in Syracuse,
N.Y., was noted in Eastern
Basketball as a possible Pitt
recruit.

Syracuse was also reportedly
after Buchanan but recruited a
number of other outstanding
players and never signed him.

0 Johnny Walker, a 6-7 small
forward from Quincy, Fla., is also
interested in playing for the Pan-
thers. He is also apparently con-
sidering Florida State, Temple
and Tennessee.

0 MacLean and Sallier were
the only two of the above eight
rated in the top 100 scholastic
players in the nation at the begin-
ning of the season.

0 A number of junior college
players are also interested in Pitt,
according to Wednesday's edi-

tion of The Pittsburgh Post-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April l4, T988

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -
The Green Bay Packers have
identified who they consider
to be the top seven players
available in the National Foot-
ball League draft, one of
whom they plan to take with
the No. 7 pick.

Tom Braatz, the Packers
vice president for football
operations, said the group in-
cludes defensive end Neil
Smith of Nebraska; cornerback
Ricky Dixon of Oklahoma;
safety Bennie Blades ofMiami
(Fla.); wide receiver Tim
Brown of Notre Dame; wide
receiver Sterling Sharpe of
South Carolina; offensive tack-
le Paul Gruber of Wisconsin;

Packers list their top
seven players in draft

and fullback Craig Heyward
of Pittsburgh.

Bratz said Auburn lineback-
er Aundray Bruce would have
been in the group but he al-
ready has been signed by At-
lanta, which has the first pick.

”We would like to stay in
the top eight players,” Braatz
said. ”We do not want to drop
down to the second plateau to
take a need.” ,

The Packers biggest need is
on the defensive line where
they hope to improve last sea-
son's weak pass rush. That
makes Smith a perfect choice
but Braatz doesn’t expect him
to be there by the seventh
pick.

Vecchio to nationals

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

It has been four years since a
Pitt woman gymnast has won a
NCAA Regional title and ad-
vanced to NCAA Nationals.

In 1984, senior Lisa Shirk
earned NCAA Eastern Regional ti-
tles on both the uneven parallel
bars and the vault. Winning these
events advanced Shirk to NCAA
Nationals. In that same year, a
freshman, Alisa Spector, qualified
as an all-arounder for Pitt.

Now, four years later, freshman
Jeannie Vecchio holds the NCAA
Eastern Regional bar title and will
compete at NCAA Nationals.
Vecchio and Coach Debbie Yoh—
man will be at the University of
Utah April 22 and 23, where the
competition will be extremely
tough but a great experience for
the freshman.

Both Vecchio and Yohman are
very pleased about going to Na-
tionals. Qualifying for NCAAs
was one of Vecchio’s goals for
the season.

’’I had two main goals, one to

make a Pitt record and the other J

to make it to Nationals,” said
Vecchio.

Vecchio did obtain the other
goal by tying the Pitt record on
balance beam with a 9.5.

As for their expectations, Yoh-
man and Vecchio seem optimis-
tic going into the competition. ’’I
am just going to go all out,” said
Vecchio. ’’It should be a fun meet
and great experience for me. Of
course, I want to hit a nice bar
routine, but l also want to make
a good showing for Pitt,” she
added.

’’I’m not making any predic-
tions,” said Yohman.

Smith said that some players
worry too much about making
mistakes. To him, that is what
keeps them back.

”Sometimes the coaches can

way you can capitalize on it,”
Smith said. ”That makes you a

an offensive and defensive tackle.

Smith is looking forward to the
upcoming season and is anxious
to get it started.

”We have set higher goals for

As spring practice starts to
dwindle down to the end, Smith
feels that the defense is starting to
come together.

”We are starting to get closer
and better as a team,” Smith said.
”I feel pretty good about the way
that practice is going. We are still

Smith seems to be making the
