Veteran Hopes to Teach Russian

Polish,Colonel Runs

C athcdral

Elevator n

An elevator operator with an exciting past and a promis-
 ing future is Colonel Frank Orlowicz who speaks six lan-
1 guages and who has received 17 decorations for bravery dur-

ing his military career.

Colonel Orlowicz is a professional soldier, and has led.

his military life serving in the

United ‘States in 1956 as a dis-0,

‘-9 placed person. For the last two
years students have seen him
running an elevator in the Cathe-
dral of Learning.

/' This elevator operator has the

distinction of having escaped‘

from German,prison camps on

three different occasions. I

Early Escape
His first chance to break from
the ‘Germans came shortly after
the last battle of Warsaw, early
in October 1939, when the Polish

Army was_forced to surrender.

Thisﬂwas the beginning of Or-
lowicz’s personal game of hide-
and-seek with the Germans.
Being imprisoned in a camp in:
side of his native Poland he was
able to escape six weeks after
his capture.

At this time there, was no of-
ficial Polish Army. Colonel Or

Former Polish Colonel.
lowicz began to organize the un-

1, derground army after his escape. 

He was. engaged in the operation
of this unit for the next ﬁve years.

_ _ Evades Gestapo

As special assistant to General
Bor-Komorowski, the chief of the
entire underground, he was in-
volved in many exciting maneuv-
ers. Evading the Gestapo was also
a full time job, but not always
a successful one.

"I was arrested by the Ges-
tapo in 1942. I was able to es-
cape later during the trans-
portation of many prisoners,”

- said Orlowicz.

And so once more he went

into hiding from the Germans.

he Warsaw uprising in Aug- ,

ust of 1944 was an unfortunate
incident for the entire under-
ground as well as for Orlowicz
.personally. He received two
wounds in this uprising, and has
one of the bullets inside him
still.

 
 

Sent To Germany

As for the army, they were
forced to surrender once again to
the Germans. This time the pris-

_oners were sent to‘ Germany.
The wounded colonel—whose

Polish Arrh‘y. He came to the

rank was then major-—was tak-
en to a hospital for prisoners
near Leipzig. After ﬁve months
he had recovered enough to.be
sent to Mulberg, a special camp
which housed 25,000 prisoners

of every nationality. Of this
number, 1,200 were polish sol-
diers. «

Here the scidiers were secretly
reorganized under ‘the colonel’s
command. “The radio we had was
never discovered,” he recalls.
“Through it I learned of the ap-
proaching Russian army from the
east. At the same time I heard
that the American Army was
nearing a river west of Mulberg.”

Americans Stop '

“We were hoping the Americans

would reach the camp ﬁrst, but
they stopped at the Mulda River.
I knew that the Russians would
send all Polish soldiers to work
in Siberia if they found us at Mul-
berg.” ‘
, So Orlowicz ‘appealed to the
German officer in charge to
have the Polish soldiers moved
to another prison camp further
west. Nine hundred of the men
were able to march, and they
were marched to the new camp
with-an escort of 35 armed Ger-
mans.

After two days ‘of marching,
Colonel Orlowicz seized one of the
guards. His men quickly took care
of the rest of the escort, and they
escaped to the American camp on
the Mulda. —

Decorated in 1919

Colonel Orlowicz received his
ﬁrst decoration for his heroic part
in the liberation of Latvia from
the Bolsheviks in 1919. As a young
sergeant cadet, he was decorated
by the Latvian minister of de-
fense for bravery, in this battle.

Among his other decorations,
the colonel has received the
highest Polish decoration for
bravery, and the British and
French decorations for.brav_ery.

Orlowicz served as commander
of the eastern frontier of Poland,
bordering all of Latvia and a part
of Russia. During his ﬁve years at
this post, he taught Russian to the
Polish officers.

Colonel Orlowicz has taken sev-
eral! courses in Russian literature
here at the University, as well as
a workshop for Russian teachers.
He hopes to become an instructor

"in Russian at the University,

sometime in the future when he
ﬁnishes the required courses.

Pre-S-season Drills
  For Footballers
Open August 23

By TED COLTON

(IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

There hasn’t been too much happening around the cam-
pus in the way of sports the past couple of months but there
will be plenty of activity come next September when the
fall sports program. swings into action. There will be _lots
of excitement in store for the avid sports followers as the
Panthers’ football, soccer, and cross~country teams take on
their opposition. ‘

Looking over this past trimester the only interesting
sport note to come out of Pitt is Larry Lauchle’s attempt to
make the Olympic team. With all of the spring sports teams
having dismal seasons, things have been pretty quiet around
here. ‘

Speaking of Lauchle, it looks as ‘ifhe has a pretty good
chance to make the United States squad if he doesn’t get
injured. He has been working out at the ﬁeld house most
of the summer and should be in top’ shape when the team
meets for ﬁnal eliminations at Oklahoma University.

Larry “has a great deal of conﬁdence in himself (which
is the best attitude for a wrestler) and feelslsure he can
make ‘the team. Coach Rex Peery has been working with
Larry a11d will make the trip to Rome if Larry makes
the team. ~ I

The ﬁnal eliminations will start on July‘ 22 when each
wrestler who has qualiﬁed will be in aspecial camp until
the best man in each weight class can be determined.

To take a quick look at the future it, looks as if the
Panther gridders are going to have a great season, maybe
one of the best the Pitt followers have ever seen. With a

host of returning lettermen, several of which will be in the’

run for All—American honors, top-notch coaching and a few
breaks, the Panthers could ﬁnd themselves right up there
near the top of that mythical top—ten rating.

August 23 is the day the gridders get down to serious
work. This will be two weeks earlier than most of the
other colleges in the country and may turn out to be a
big advantage in the ﬁrst couple of games. But oh, look
at that schedule: UCLA, Michigan State, Oklahoma, Miami,
West Virginia, TCU, Syracuse, Notre Dame, Army and
Penn State.

One last note: The baseball tickets that were alloted
the Pitt students for the Pirates’ baseball games were only
half-used up. We suggest students write to the Pirates and
thank them for their consideration. '

Cat .Wrestler’s
Way To Home

Rex Perry and Larry
Lauchle stand an excellent

chance of making the cross-
water trip to Rome with the
U. S. Olympic team come
this August. Lauchle, who has

qualiﬁed in both the freestyle and
greco-roman‘ style Wrestling, will

be a heavy favorite to win the '

latter style.

“We have been spending all of
our time on the greco-roman style
because we fell that Larry has a
better chance to make the team
in that division,” said Peery, who
has been working with Lauchle
every day. Peery will also make
the trip to Oklahoma for the ﬁnal
eliminations and then to Rome if
Lauchle makes the team.

“Larry has been looking very
good and should win this thing,”
continued Peery. When asked’
about Lar'ry’s weight Peery
said, “He left I here at 133
pounds which is about right.
He’ll report to the" camp on the
21st at about 129 and should be
down to the 125 limit within
the next couple of days.”

Lauchle wrestled in the 130
pound class during the regular
season but usually goes down to
123 for the Nationals.

Lauchle will wrestle in Okla-
homa from July 22 to August 15
and then the team -will go to
New York and will depart for
Rome on the 18th. '

Peery will coach Lauchle
throughout the trip and will act
as a judge at Oklahoma and hopes
to do some refereeing at the

Gridiron Drills

August 23 is D-Day for Coach
John Michelosen’s Panthers. For
the ﬁrst time in ten years the foot-
ballers will leave their campus for
pre-season drills. The sight of the
Panther workouts will be Alle-
gheny College, Meadville, Pa.

I Michelosen plans to limit his
squad to 55 men who will stage
ten practices at Allegheny before
returning to their home campus,
where they will be joined by ‘the
rest of the squad. _
The main reason for the shift
in ﬁelds is the fact that con-
struction and renovation of the
dormitories here are not expect-
ed to be completed prior to Sept.

1, and under NCAA regulations

the Panthers can begin their

training season on August 23.

' The squad will leave for Alle-
gheny College on Sunday, August
21 and drills will start on Tues-
day. This will be the second time
the Panthers have held pre-season
drills at Allegheny. The last time
was back in 1950.

Return of the ‘One Room Schoolhouse’

  University Combines

   Traditional with New

While other grade school children are romping about
during their summer vacations; 200 children are studying
busily at Falk School. Hardly forming a homogeneous group,
‘these children are carefully chosen. They include groups of
“brilliant,” “normal,” “retarded” and “handicapped” stu-

dents.

The atinosphere of the school iso

‘a combination of the new and the
old. -Modern educational tech-
niques are being tried out -in
the classes. Classrooms are pat-
terned after the traditional one-
room schoolhouses where children
‘of all grades study together under
‘one teacher.

It is believed that in this in-
formal atmosphere each student is
’ ‘given valuable individual atten-
tion and is encouraged to progress
I at a rate most natural for himself
w»’ _ without being self-conscious.
"T The students are separated into
two schools. In the first, 120vst.u-
, dents, selected from wide cultural
and economic backgrounds are
taught in six classrooms. In the
second, 80 children, composed of
- 20 “gifted” students, mentally re-
tarded students, and students with
visual, auditory, and physical
handicaps are placed in five class-
- rooms. _
The University departments of
elementary and special education
are conducting this educational
‘study. According to Dr. Jack W.
Birch, of the Department of Spec-
ial Education, the aim of the pro-
 gram is “. . . to demonstrate how
much, children of dilferent age
groups, and those of different
physical andmental abilities, can'-
profit by being partitioned off by
themselves, or with others of just
~ jthe same age and abilities.”
Having begun June 27, the
_ school will be run for six weeks.
.Along with the teachers, admini-
strators, and special consultants
.working in this program, Univer-
sity graduate students are parti-
cipating, thereby earning from one
to six credits. ~

they were said to be making too
much noise at the station. He con-
cluded by saying that a ten page
paper could be written on how the
police treated them.

Pease also commented on the
manner in which the incident was
handled. In the July 13 issue of
the Post Gazette, Pease was quot-
ed as saying--“The magistrate (E.
N. Johnson) just made _a blanket
penalty and ﬁne for all. I don’t
think he considered all the fac-
tors in the situation," I will bring
it to the magistrate’s attention."

‘Pease deﬁnitely plans to con-_
vey these (concerning the three
boys uninvolved) to the magis-

trate in an,attempt to clear them ‘

of this
conduct. A ,

“Statements will be enclosed on
the permanent records of the boys
who were involved,” said Pease.
They were: Bob Erlich, Kenneth
Lazer, Larry Levy, David Spott,
and Steve Swartz.

Each boys also has been warn-
ed that should a similar occasion
arise during their Pitt career they
will receive strict displinary ac-
tion. .

Pease -concluded, “It is unfor-
tunate that these incidents receive
such widespread attention, when
much of the ﬁne work done by
fraternities goes unnoticed.
