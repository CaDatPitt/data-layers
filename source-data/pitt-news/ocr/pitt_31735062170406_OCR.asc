noon at2p.m. ‘

Fonda will not present slides of her recent trip to North Vietnam
because there is no space available on campus during the time of her

“Space is bad on campus, and since Fonda is scheduled for 2 p.m.,
most large rooms on campus are being used for classes,” Seman said. A

Seman dispelled any rumors of the University‘s not providing a
place for the controversial slides by saying that when Fonda asked for

Seminars Trigger Interest

by BOB OBENREDER

The first day in a four day ‘se-
ries of Career Seminars kicked
off today when 525 people attend-
ed the “Careers in Government
and Public Service" seminar in
the Student Union Ballroom.

Tedie Fakles. Career Planning
Co—ordinator for the University
Counseling Center, remarked.
"This is the best turnout that we
have ever had for our seminars
in government careers. After
reading the student evaluation
forms I can also say that most of
the people that attended found the
seminars highly informative and
helpful."

The seminars, which bring pro-
fessionals to campus to discuss
careers in their area of expertise
with interested students have
been increasingly well attended
in the past few years.

Fakles attributed this to "a
growing awareness among under-
graduates that success in finding
jobs requires that a student have
a focused, as opposed to general.
undergraduate education and that
they get some practical experi-
ence in their field of interest prior
to graduation.“

The guests at the seminar said
they talked with many interested
students during the session. which
was held from 1-4 p.m.

Doug Walgren, Democratic can-
didate for Congress from the 18th
District, was one of the profes-

L Faculty for McGovern Plans Action

Pitt Faculty for McGovern has
announced plans for its first two
activities.

Today from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m.
in the Public Health Auditorium.

lbthere will be a meeting with a

J

teach-in sort of purpose. A dozen
or more faculty and students with
particular areas of. concern‘ and
experience will present a series
of brief talks on a variety of cam-
paign issues. All are welcome to
attend for any or all of the time.
(A partial list of the speakers is
below.)

On Wednesday, Oct. 11, from 4
to 6 p.m. in the new Faculty
Lounge on the 17th floor of the
Cathedral of Learning, there will
be Qrifund-raising cocktail party
($5 a person) with speakers from
the McGovern campaign. Tickets

-7' will be available from the ‘depart-

mental representatives.

Pitt Faculty for McGovern has
for several weeks been involved
in setting up the organization and
in recruiting volunteers. There is
now a representative in every
school and nearly every depart-
ment. The principal goal to this
point has been the identifying of
faculty volunteers t'or- various
tasks in the campaign: research.

An alarming increase in the
number of bicycle thefts. amount-
ing to a loss of over $3,000 from
May-July alone. has paralleled-
the increasing popularity of bikes
on campus. according to compar-
ative figures. Reported thefts re-
flect that the number and total
values of losses have more than
tripled in the past year.

There is no "safe“ place to
leave an unattended bike on cam-
pus. but the areas hit hardest have
been the Cathedral (Bellefield).
Schenley Hall. and Hillman ‘Li-
brary. Nor is there a safe time.
t'or most of the thefts have oc-
curred in broad daylight.

Nearly all of the bikes stolen
were the English Racer type (10
speeds included), and nearly all
were locked and chained.

Bike Thefts

Many security-minded (read
paranoid) readers are aware of

available deterrents like the sup-

posedly “uncuttable" chains. but
according to Detective Charles

Graham of the Campus Police. A

these chains are largely ineffect-
ual. "With a larger chain on one
of the more expensive bikes. the

thief will simply switch from 18",

bolt cutters to 24" cutters. ‘What
many students do. and I hate to
see it come -to this. is to detach
the front wheel and carry it
around to class.“

A registration drive by the Cam-
pus Police will be held Tuesday
and Wednesday, Oct.10-'-11 on the
patio of the Student Union. Stu-

dent identification will be affixed.

extremely difficult to eradicate. ‘

people interested in running for
political office, andlie outlined his
ideas on how to do this. Walgren
indicated active political interest
was the key to a career in politics;
that getting elected is a result of
this interest. “Politics is a way of
being involved with people." Wal-
gren stated, and suggested any
job dealing with the public. such
as legal service or social work.
is a good way to get started.

Keith Swenson, administrative
assistant to Congressman John
Heinz, III, talked to students con-
cerning congressional aides. He
suggested the internship pro-
grams sponsored by congress-
men as one possible means of be-
coming an aide. Swenson stressed
experience over academic pur-
suits as the most important fac-
tor in seeking a position.

Experience seemed to lie the

recurring qualification in talking
with all the guests. Billie Bram’-'

noster, Director of the City Plan-
ning Department, emphasized the

need for education beyond a bach-' -

elors degree or experience in such
groups as the Peace Corps,
VISTA, or development firms as
important prerequisites for jobs
in city planning. She said, “The

idea of being a change agent in .

terest to the students, and that-
she was impressed that most of,
these people were more concern- »

ed with improving society than
with pecuniary benefits. V i

The Mayor’s Committee on Hu-

Face Subsidy Repayment

by VIRGINIA cook

The State Senate last week ap-
proved legislation that, if also
adopted by the State House of
Representatives, would require
medical students in all Pennsyl-
vania schools to repay that por-
tion of their educational costs the

_ state contributes to the school.

It is expected this would affect
all seven medical schools in Penn-
sylvania, since the state contri-
butes to all of them.

Although .tuition costs at the
schools would not be affected by
this legislation, it is estimated
that the amount a graduate would
be required to repay would be be-
tween $17,000 and-$26,000.

Payment of the required state
-"loans” could be accomplished in

thorized racks and to take advan-
tage of the registration program.

which will facilitate recovery of ‘

stolen vehicles. Thus far about 15
per cent of these bikes have been
recovered, and a number of ar-
rests have been made. i

Finally. any students who are,
or have been. victimized are
urged to report their loss without
delay to the Campus Police to
help combat this problem.

one of three ways. ‘For each year
that a graduate engages in “gen-

eral family practice” in a “phy-_ 

sician shortage area," as desig-
nated by the Pennsylvania State

Secretary of Health, 20 per cent of  if

the loan would be forgiven. Or,
for each year of residency served

in any hospital in Pennsylvania. 5
10 per cent of the loan would be‘ .'

forgiven. Or for each year of prac-

tice in Pennsylvania in any medi-f  
cal specialty in any location in the?  v_
state, 10 per cent of the loan. " i

would ”be forgiven. If the grad-

uate decides to repay the loan out- I ‘I

right. i.e., if he decides to prac-
tice outside Pennsylvania,
payments must begin" no later
than four years after graduation.

For each year he practices less ‘

than nine months in Pennsylvania,

he would be required to repay five I 

per cent of the loan.

A student being sponsored 
another state would not be re- w  
quired to pay back any money to ' ' '

the state, but no money will be
given to the medical school on be--
half of these students.

The legislation, introduced by"
Senators Donolow and Stapleton, ’
was passed by a vote of 45 to-0.,"
As of Monday afternoon, Senator

Donolow could not be reached for
clarification of the measure. Sim-
ilar legislation has been intro-
duced in the last legislative ses-

sion, but was defeated. The leg- fl

islation now goes to the House.

AN ORGANIZATIONAL meeting of those interested in serving on the
CAS Cabinet will be held Thursday, Oct. 5, at 7:30 p.m. in Room

425, SU.

Ro'n Eskin, the president of the Cabinet, is interested in organ-
izing a Cabinet with a representative from each of the departments .
within the University. It will be the responsibility of the represen-
tatives to bring student gripes and opinions as expressed within

ty of jobs in the social field.

One field where scarcity of jobs
was not the case was that of cam-
paign technician. Mary Ellen Mill-
er of the National Republican Con-
gressional Committee, said, “The
opportunities are great. Nothing
takes the place of ‘ adequate ex-
perience,” she added. She encour-
aged students interested in the
profession to participate actively
in every campaign possible dur-
ing‘ college and advocated spe-
cializing in a particular area of
campaigning because of the need
for such people. Miller mentioned
the profession may be a full or
part-time occupation.

Jim Seif, representing the U.S.
Attorney's Office and the Pitt Law
School, commented on the’ job
scarcity in the law profession and
the difficulty of getting into and
staying in school. He explained
that law school was difficult, chal-
lenging and, paradoxically, boring
at times.

FBI agents John Shay and
George Stephan said they had ex-

_ perienced a “big response . . .

about 35 people who were inter-
ested.” They defined the require-
ments for a special agent: a’ law
or’ accounting degree was prefer-
red, but also a B.A. coupled with
service in the Armed Forces and/
‘or mastery of a foreign language.

‘Job opportunities for females

were described as better than av-
erage.

Career Seminar Informs

The City Detective Bureau was
represented by,Robert Coll, As-
sistant Supervisor in charge of
the Detective Branch of the Pitts-
burg Police. He said job oppor-

- tunities in municipal police de-

partments were not great, but
that corporate, state, and federal
security fields were “opening
up.” Experience in these fields,
with a degree in police science

could be valuable in obtaining a
police position in the future. The
Pittsburgh Police has not hired
any new policemen since 1970, but
may be hiring next year. Coll stat-
ed most policeman like their jobs
because of the satisfaction of
helping protect others, but a
drawback is the scarcity of su-
pervisory positions and subse-
quent lack of lateral movement.

SDTS Win Scholarships.

by JEFF PASEK

Two members of Sigma Delta
Tau Sorority at Pitt were surpris-
ed this summer to" find that they
were the recipients of scholar-
ships from the National SDT
Foundation.

Bebe Weinberg and Debi Paris
applied for the award last spring.
Only 17 of the scholarships were
awarded nationally among mem-
bers in 46 chapters. The awards
were based on academic perform-
ance; community, university. and
sorority service; and financial
need. Grants ranged from $200 to
$300. '

Weinberg found out about her

scholarship while working at a
camp outside Cleveland last Aug-
ust. She commented: ‘fl didn’t re-
member applying. I really didn’t
think__ there was any 'chance.”1-A,
senior Dance-Therapy major,
Weinberg is now serving ascor-
responding secretary of the Pitt
SDT chapter.

Paris was “really shocked,
’cause I didn’t expect it at all. The

only reasion I applied was be-

cause I thought there was some
remote chance.” Paris is a senior

majoring in Elementary Educa-'

tion. She was first vice-presi-
dent of Alpha Zeta chapter last
year.

Health Laws Protect  

Ott-Cam pus Tenants

by JEFF PASEK
Before you rationalize yourself to another year with cockroaches

and without screens in your off—campus apartment. you might be wise-

to check the rules of the Allegheny County Health Department.

\ Some of the regulations can help to make your apartment more
1 liveable at the expense of your landlord.

Many landlords are satisfied with a quick, cheap painting of their

units that takes no account of windows. If your windows are painted (or

1 even nailed) shut, you may have a legitimate complaint. According to
the Health Department, “Every habitable room shall have at least one
window which can be opened easily, or such other device as will ade-

‘ quately ventilate the room.” '

If opening your windows means allowing every insect in Oakland

the free reign of your apartment. the Health Department rules again

.,.’..\ come to your aid. According to the law. "Every window or other device

with openings to.outdoor space. used or intended to be used for ventila-
tion. shall have screens . .  . -

If you look out your window and find a clogged drain pipe filled with
last week’s rain, you may have another provision of the law on your
side. “No person shall maintainor permit to be maintained any recept-
acle or pool, whether natural or artificial, containing water in such con-

" dition that insect breeding therein may become a menace to the public
health.” While it might be difficultgto force your landlord to clean the
drain spouts, your being able to refer to the law may be enough to con-

_ vince him that cleaning them is in his best interests.

It's hard to find an apartment in Oakland, or Shadyside for that
matter, which doesn’t have its share of cockroaches and other assorted

, pests. If your apartment is the only one in the building with coachroach— .

 ea‘. the responsibility to have them exterminated is yours. But on the
other hand. if other tenants in the sameybuilding have apartments which
are infested with cockroaches. "extermination shall be the responsibil-
,5’-"' ity of the owner.“ , I V
Violations of the’Allegheny County Health Department rules are
common inthe Oakland area. If your apartment contains enough viola-
tions. you may be eligible for Rent Withholding. The Rent Withholding
, program allowstenants living in sub-standard housing to pay their
5 ' rents to a bank instead of their landlord until the violations are cor-
; rected. If reported violations are not repaired‘ in a short time. the
1 owner may be prosecuted. If the violations remain unrepaired for six
months, the tenant may have his rent money returned to him.

These are only a few of the provisions of the Allegheny County
‘ Health Department r_egulations. For a copy of these rules and further
information on the Rent Withholding program in Pittsburgh. stop in at
the Pitt Tenant Union and the Legal A-wareness Committee. 306 Stu-

HARRISBURG (APi — Penn-

Herbert Denenberg has issued an
"Investor‘s Guide to Polluters."

governments in the state he says
have been cited for pollution.

The guide indicates the name of
the company and type of pollution
involved — sewage. industrial
waste. water and air.

Denenberg said the guide is be-
ing sent to all insurance compa-
nies doing business in Pennsyl-
vania so the companies can exert

influence by withholding invest-
ment funds or by providing funds
to help eliminate the particular
problem.

“We think an investor should
avoid companies that do not meet
their social responsibilities even
if they makea profit.“ Denenberg
said. "An investment should be
socially sound as well as finan-
cially sound.

"This is part of our continuing
effort to push the insurance in-
dustry to invest its $260 billion
portfolio in a constructive -way."

Death Penalty Bill Pending

WASHINGTON (AP t-—Stift' leg-
islation to permit death penalties
against skyjackers and terrorists
and to suspend U.S. air service to
countries that harbor them.passed
the House Monday. 354 to 2.

The bill was sent to House-Sen-
ate conferees for the compromise
with a similar Senate bill that
would in addition authorize a new
airport security force.

House Commerce Committee
Chairman Harley O. Staggers
(D.-W.Va.), who will head House
conferees, promised they will
look favorably on a Senate provi-
sion to expand use of gun and met-
al detecting devices for U.S. air-
ports.

Both the House and Senate bills
would authorize the President to
suspend air service with any
country he determines to be har-
boring or encouraging skyjackers
or terrorism involving airliners.

Service could be halted also to any
third country that continues to
maintain service with the offend-
ing country.

Both bills also would set a mini-
mum’ 20-year prison sentence for
the skyjackers and give U.S.
juries the option of recommend-
ing death.

year as opposed to the Johnson
administration’s $531 million in
1968 for crime prevention and
control. Let’s take a further look
into the increase in expenditures
by President Nixon from those
of the Johnson administration
which might explain in part the
crime control records of the two
administrations. In the area of
crime research there has been a
20 fold increase in expenditures.
Criminal law reform and crime
prevention expenditures have each
increased 10 times while law en-
forcement went from $309 million
to $933 million. Money for re-
habilitation increased six fold. ‘

There has also been an increas-
ing concern over the drug problem
that plagues the U. S. President
Nixon has also had a notable
record in this aspect of his ad-
ministration. Expenditures for
programs designed to confront
the drug problem have increased
600 percent over the past three
years. New offices have’ been
set up in the administration while
existing ones have been expanded
to encompass a wider scope. Nar-
cotics are being siezed at an in-
crease of 400 percent since 1969.

Talk of all the federal assist-

‘ance provided to state and local

law enforcement agencies‘ ex-
clude the fact that actual funds
have barely trickled down to the
local level. More than 95 percent
of the appropriations_assigned to
the federal Law Enforcement
Assistance Agency in the fiscal
year. Realization of the need for
a multitude of changes within
the nation_,’.s prison systems has
evidently not reached the admin-

every dollar spent today on cor-
rectional institutions goes toward
rehabilitation. Meagre Congres-

Perhaps most detrimental of

vention is the absence of presi-

of strict gun control legislation.

such legislation “under study,” a

Editor's Note: This is the third
in a series of debates in which
the College Young Democrats,
the College Young Republicans
and student members of the Hall,
Tyner, Henderson campaign
(communist party) discuss
rent campaign issues.

CUF-

The debates will appear in this
space every Wednesday until the
election.

The opinions expressed in these
articles will not necessarily re-
flect official party positions, but
rather the opinions of the indivi-
dual writers.

The topic of today's debate is
law and order.

over 100,000 have experienced
a decrease in the number of seri-
ous crimes in 1971 and statistics
have shown in the past that the
number of cities in this category
increases annually. Indictments
against organized crime have
tripled and convictions have
doubled. ’

President Nixon’s re—election
would mean continued improve-
ment‘in the war against crime
and four more years of effective
programs in the fight against
lawlessness. Re-elect the Presi-
dent.

 Ciime Rate Deﬁes Optimistic Rhetoric

York Police Chief Patrick Murphy,
a supporter of gun legislation,
from an FBI sponsored meeting
on police safety held in the spring
of 1971.

Senator George 'McGovern’s
legislative record and proposals
for crime prevention involve the
application. of realistic solu-
tions ‘that do not threaten to
curb basic civil liberties. In the
Senate he has sponsored alter-
native proposals to the excesses
of the D. C. Crime Bill, initiated
efforts toward passage of a Police-
man’s Bill of Rights, that would
provide educational and career in-
centives to create an updated po-
lice force, and supported the Gun
Control Bill of 1968. He has call-
ed for an increased federal com-
mitment to the reduction of
hard drug traffic, a burgeoning
enterprise supported primarily by
organized criminal operations.

McGovern’s overall
toward the crime problems re-
veals a thorough understanding of
the complex social forces that
have led to the current crisis.
He agrees with those who feel
that white-collar crime and vio-
lations performed by corporations
involving billions of dollars
should be attacked as vigorously
as the purse snatchers and the
car thieves. He recognizes the
need for a complete overhauling
of our prison systems, ’.“Factories
of Crime” as described by Ram-
sey Clark, with an emphasis on
rehabilitation and treatment inno-
vation, directed toward the re-
duction of the phenomenal rate
of recividism. His more sophisti-
cated and humane approach con-
trasts sharply with the “Dragnet
— Gangster” philosophy oflthe
Nixon administration, a philoso-
phy that in practice has brought
us more wire-taps and more
crowded jails but no concrete re-
sults.

Most fundamental to the Mc-
Govern alternative is the redir-
ection of federal revenues toward
the eradication of the environ-
ment of crime——the poverty and
plight of the_ urban ghettos. Un-
like his opponent and past can-
didate of both parties, McGovern’s
proposed defense spending cuts
and tax structure reform provide
the means for conducting such an.
urgent transformation, a trans-
rrriation _tha_t.will attack crime

Labled ‘Racist Attack’

by NANCY BITENSKY
Hall—Tyner—Henderson
Campaign Committee
Today in the United States there is a campaign being waged by
many politicians about “law and order.” The Nixon administration

is making this one of their main platforms with a special RACIST’

ATTACK ON THE BLACK AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES in
this election year. -

But, let us look at the facts: today 92 per cent of the nation’s
wealth is owned and controlled by two percent of the population.
Unemployment, by a CONSERVATIVE estimate is.nationally 5.9
percent (this figure does not include welfare recipients and first
time job seekers.)-Among Black people unemployment is as high as
12.5 percent and in some cities among Black youth it is as high as
47.9 percent! '

Over 30 million people in the U.S. or one out of every ten fam-
ilies live, according to gov’t. standards, in poverty. Clearly, we have
a si_tuation in which peoples’ needs are not met, with no available
jobs and an insufficient welfare system. I

Eighty-five percent of the crimes committed here are considered
PROPERTY CRIMES. This seems only logical in a situation in
which millions are in need of food, clothing, etc.

Today we find that 85 percent of the inmates in prison are from
working class backgrounds. In Philadelphia, for example, last year
there were 19,000 arrests. Ninety-three per cent of those._ arrested
were Black. 6 percent Puerto Rican and 1 percent white. This is
indicative of a clear-cut racist policy. Coupled with police brutality
it makes the situation disastrous.

Meanwhile, one of the most vicious and barbaric crimin L
of all time is not only free to roam among and infest the minds oi
the people but he is currently the president of the U.S.A. Richard
Nixon has murdered millions in Indochina. He has purposely bomb-
ed the dikes and seeded the clouds so that it would rain and bring
distruction and death to the Vietnamese people.

This outlaw has robbed the American people of their jobs, food
and just decent living conditions. He has inflicted the most racist
policies upon the Black, Puerto Rican, Native American, Asian and
Chicano peoples. Clearly, Richard Nixon is the worst criminal
living today.

The Communist Party has a platform that speaks out against
racism, something that George McGovern hasn’t even addressed him-
self to.' We call for the extension of democracy and an end to po-
lice state methods. We will outlaw racism and treat all those who
commit racist crimes as criminals.- We will end the illegal presi-
dential use of war making policies. We will abolish the FBI and
end all political frame-ups’. We will repeal all prepressive legisla-
tion and, end police brutality. We will disarm the police and
forbid the use of them or the national guard to supress labor at}
peoples’ struggles. We will demand a judicial system that works for
the people. The state will pay for all court costs including the
defense. Bail will be set according to the capability of those who
can pay.

Fire Extinguishers
Pose Safety Problem

by JOHN METCALFE

A discrepancy in safety? conditions has recently come to
our attention. Fire extinguishers in the Student Union are fur-

nished with inspection tags which indicate that the last in-.

spection was carried out in September of 1971. The tags fur-
ther state that, the inspection is “invalid after date stamped.”
Aswe are now well into October. the extinguishers are. def-
initely beyond the inspection period required by law. The

wording is ambiguous; they may be more than a month over- ’

due.

The extinguishers in question are of .the soda-acid type,
which must be inverted to provide a stream of water. They
donot represent the latest technology in fire-fighting appara-
tus, but they are very nearly fool-proof. They are useful only
against “Class A” fires (paper, wood, rubbish, etc.) and are
not recommended for use on electrical fires or flamable liq-
uids. Presumably they are adequate protection for any fire
likely to begin in the Student Union. I '

It "would be silly to assume/‘that every one of those ex-
tinguishers has become unusable on its anniversary date. Most
of them would probably function if needed. But this iﬁx
approach to safety on the part of the University goes beyond
simple considerations of danger. ~

Every student is reminded by the Student Handbook of the
Student’s responsibility to observe all appropriate laws, local,
state and federal, while in attendance at Pitt, as well as the
Student Code of Conduct.

Apparently this arrangement is not reciprocal.

The University, which is probably obliged to conform to

city and state fire regulations, does not. The law requires that «

central records be kept on all fire-fighting material, to,facil-
itate prompt inspection as due dates occur.

If the University is sometimes indifferent to our safety,
nobody will be too indignant. It fits the stereotype; it is
the nature of large institutions to treat us with contempt.

But when the University demands compliance with all
la.wS,,by its students...,;whil

As this is my first term in Oak-
land, having transferred from the
University’s Johnstown campus,
I have been inclined to compare
things here with those at UPJ.
Some I have found far superior
here while the Johnstown campus
also had its distinct advantages.
One difference I have found is
worth mentioning. That is the lack
of television sets on this campus.

Living on campus, I have found
only two televisions available for
resident's use. One is an old,
poor quality black and white set
in Schenley Hall, and the other-a

lobby. With approximately‘ 3,000
students residing in the Towers
and the Quadrangle, only two tele-
vision sets is extremely insuffi-
cient: When I’ve gone to watch a

TV special or a sport’s show, I‘

have found the rooms overcrowd-
ed and I’m forced to take a dis-
tant seat where it is next to im-
possible to follow the show.

This is not my major gripe-—but

it’s the fact that both of these sets v

can only be used during certain
h‘q'txrs. This past weekend I was
lucky enough to get a seat near
the set, and was watching a ‘good
movie. At 10:45 a campus guard
came in the lobby and shut the set
off, with only 15 minutes of the
movie left!

The Johnstown campus had at
least two full size color sets in
each dorm available for resident
student’s use 24 hours a day !’ With
approximately 120 students per
dorm this is a ratio of only 60
students to a set, compared to
1500:1here.

Many students are not affluent
enough to afford their own tele-

vision sets, and television is a
source of entertainment as well
as information to them. The 11
p.m. news, of interest to many,
will be a thing of the past if the
sets are continually shut off at 11.

With the rising cost of higher
education and dorm fees one
would expect that the University
should be able to afford the cost
of strategically located television
sets.

Editor; The Pitt News:

One vital point which remained
obscure in the recent articles on
the tax structure by the College
Young Democrats and Republi-
cans, as well as the Communists,
is that coercive taxation is an in-

-fringement on individual liberty.

By condoning an involuntary tax
structure, the major political par-
ties are not only supporting a vio-
lation of individual property
rights, they are granting that gov-
ernment has the right to regulate
the lives of individuals and seize
the products of their labor with-
out their consent. In effect. the
governmental tax system is noth-
ing less than legalized theft.

It has been apparant in the ar-
ticles which have been published
thus far, and it will become more

evident in future articles that the '

sole difference between the major
political parties is the degree of
socialism they advocate. If the
Pitt News readers will study fu-

ture articles by the College Young.

Democrats and Republicans, they
will ascertain that one group ad-
heres to a liberal approach. while
the other adheres to a conserva-
tive ’approach towards statism

Editor, The Pitt News:

Congratulations to the Pitt News
for acquiring the services of one
John Metcalfe, columnist, critic.
and wit—at-large. John’s column on
the monstrous one-way plan for
Forbes and Fifth Aves. should be
required reading for all city coun-
cilman who favor continuing the
plan.

What the author failed to-men-
tion in his column was his pen-
chant for running over old ladies,
foreign exchange students, and
volunteers (?) for the re-election
of President What’s-His-Name.

Having had ‘the good fortune of
being a journalistic associate of

Metcalfe when we frequented a‘

local education slum (read com-
munity college), I am pleased to
note that John’s wonderfully ir-
reverant wit has not been silenced
by his arrival at the Giant Cathe-
dral. No, I am not one of John’s
relatives, nor the president of his
fan club.

Sartre's Hellish Vision Revealed

by KEITH SHUSTER

No Exit, Jean-Paul Sartre’s one
act vision of hell, is a curious
piece of theater. Written by a
philosopher, the play never es-
capes the syllogistic quest of the

’ author. It is filled with the its

of premises; each speech suggests
an endless circle of questions
about the various truths to be
found in the human personality}, ‘.
Truth here has awesome rami-
fications, for it is the final judge-
ment, the last definition assigned
to the lives of the three dead souls
whoare the play’s main charac-
ters. In attempting a play of this
nature, the Studio Theatre has
shown no small amount of temer-
ity, for No Exit requires not
only the usual exuberance of life
to bring it the touch and scent of
humankind, but also, balanced
against that, it demands a care-
ful tautness to preserve the awful
endless questioning that is part
of the burden of existential free-

dom. The audience must never

be allowed to lose itself completely
in the tragic task of three persons’
ultimate self-knowledge and self-
acceptance.

Unopenable, inescapable doors
dominate the set with a sense of

growing frustration with things
' -that cannot be moved or changed.
For in this hell, action can no long- '

er be taken, only rather impotent-
-ly attempted. The struggle in this
room is..one between action, the

.I_

will to live and to become, and in-
ertia, the acceptance of oneself
as one is at a certain point. “

Sartre and director Williams

"not only insist that this struggle

never ends, but also simply re-
peats itself in variations. They
also force the people concerned.
both actors and audience. to in-
flict stinging reproaches about that
never attained inertia of self-

‘acceptance. To end this particular

search for truth, to rely upon a
final answer to “Who am I?" is
death, and there is no hell or
theatre in conclusive certainty.

So around ‘and around in mazes
of self-delusion, self-hatred, and
self-denial the three "absent"
characters go. The fulcrum of pow-
er rests on Inez, played by Nicol-
lette Gramatikas, a lesbian who
sees only too clearly her own sins.
a knowledge which makes her
too adept at perceiving others.

She admits to having caused
three deaths from this knowledge
including her own. Gramatikas
is horrifying as only \a human
monster can be. Her knowledge
reveals itself in every painfully
piercing look, in every tortured
gesture. What she does not under-
stand, however, is loving, and
the way she loves ma_kes her vul-
nerable to her other two room-
mates, J. J. Tierney as Garcin
and Pauls Swart as Estelle.

lieves himself not to be one. He's
the type of man who is called a
bastard because he so desparately
wants someone to punish him. Mr.
Tierney does an excellent job of
maintaining this ambivalent atti-
tude towards himself throughout
the play. Trapped by this ambigu-
ous self-image, he is— unable to
leave when the doors at last open.

When he finally says. “Hell is
other people," we recognize this
is true because he cannot define
himself for himself. Paula Swart‘s
Estele is a small masterpiece of
carefully controlled shallowness.
A temptation to Garcin and Inez's
desire to win affection, she is
nonetheless disgusting to both for
her lack of self-awareness, her
ability to live lies about herself.

So the play proceeds. Caught ina
chain-reaction of self-inflicted and
mutual torture, these three toss
Eve’s apple around, inextricably
bound up in a deadly game of
“Hot Potato”, because they can no
longer act and have resigned them-
selves to the judgements of the
others.

Like we too watch without res-
pite this role-playing that claws
down -the masks most wear, but
never penetrates them entirely,
never revolts to reach a self-ac-
ceptance. Williams has shut the
doorson us too. There is no es-
cape in emotion, no escape in ra-

_ tional logic, that this mixture of

art and philosophy could_give us
if the balance between them
was broken. Rather we are left
with the paranoia that results
when one does not act, when

one weighs too many sides too. ,

and yet, not enough.

Johnson Says TV Fails 
To Reach Its Capacity

by GORDON BARTAGE

dividuals cope with society and fight the crisis commercialism of'=.,:;;?
the ‘system’ he helps run? Preposterous. you say‘? Then read Nichol-t-‘:33-i7_
aus Johnson’s‘ Test Pattern for Living. It offers some unique sugges-ff;
tions as to how a person can come to greater appreciation of life.’;'f_ff

  

' with a stress on the media Johnson has directed the past _six years.

Many of the‘book’s ideas are not new. If you are acquainted with‘-.-
self-realization books like Charles Reich’s Greening of America}:-‘i
you will find a new enlightenment in about 20 of the book’s”1‘45'. ‘
pages. Although he admonishes Reich for believing that the ultimatei.
political result of consciousness will be a new form of government;
Johnson reaches much the same conclusion.

  
   
 
  
  
   
  
 
  
  
  

One of Johnson’s main points is the failure of television to achiev _
any of its potential. He is greatly dismayed at the vast differenc“ 
between what it is and what it could be. He sees where TV could help,

Concerning television commercials, Johnson says. "once you start
manufacturing needs as well as products. the whole system spins out?
of control. ‘ 

Its (television’s) primary measure of an individual‘s worth 
his consumption of products. his measuring up to ideals that are{ ‘
found in packages mass produced and distributed by corporate Amer-If

1C3.

In reference to the fact that over 60 percent of America gets mos
of its_information from TV, the author says, "Of all the corporat_,
influences in our lives, the corporate control of television is perhap 
our nation’s greatest tragedy.“

There is a closer connection
than a mere coincidence. how-
ever. The name belongs to both.
the father and the son.

It was no large accident that
Louie. Jr. plays on the.same foot-
ball team his pap is coaching. He
wanted it that way.

As a star halfback-linebacker at
Thomas Jefferson High School,
the son really considered only two
other schools to attend on football
scholarships. Iroonically—or is‘ it
—both schools were ones the
father had previously coached.

Since he was going to follow his
father around, he decided to go -
right to the source of his admir-

' ation.

Three years later now, stretch-
ed out on a training table in the
Pitt locker room, the yﬁinger Lou
doesn’t regret his choice in the
least. -

s“I guess everyone expects that

,.there will be problems,” he said,

commenting on the father and son
matchup. “I haven’t had any at
all.”

face resting on his folded hands._

was a chance,” he noted, “Be-
sides, it’s a lot easier for my
parents to. see all the home games
h

))

Venzin was not a regular un-

enough last year to earn a letter.
He quotes the two Florida State
games as being the highlights of
his career at Pitt, but feels that
his performance in this year’s
game was by far his best.

Venzin plays middleguard in
Pitt’s T15-2 defense, acting as a
conglomerate of both linebacker
and lineman. “You never know
what's liable to happen,” be
emphasized, “You mostly hit the
center and try to read the play.
You follow the center’s head as
he ‘blocks you and try to get to
where the play is going ahead of
him. “ _,

“The 5-2 is a good stable de-
fense, I’m satisfied with the
whole defense in general, we
have a bunch of good players
and everybody does their job.”

Venzin would love to play pro-
fessional football, but *doesn’t
expect to get drafted because of
his size (6’ 230 lbs.).” It’s every-
body’s dream to play pro foot-.
ball, but the scouts will he look-
ing at kids twice my size. I’m
heavy enough but not tall enough.”
Unfortunately, his height is the
one thing he can’t control.

He would like to go into coach-

ing, or anything to stay in foot-

ball. “If I don’t become a coach
at a college or high school, I’ll
probably end up coaching little kids.

Venzin has by nomeans given
up on the season, and is one of
the most devoted players on the
squad. “All the guys want to win,’
we have the people_to win,” he
enthused.

With Linebacker George Feher
the latest in a long line of injur-
ies, one could understand the team
or a/player being a_ little down.

But Venzin refuses to be so. He -,
" still insists that the team can win,

and will do so despite the injur-
ies.

“Even with all the injuries we
have, we still have the talent to
win. Our attitude is much better
than last. year, V and nobody wants V

ticeably across the small_of his
back, with heat packs comforting
both his leg and butt, Cecconi the
runner looks a sports writer in the
face with his hazel eyes and says‘:
“You could say that,” when "asked
if he thought highly of his father.

In this player’s case. it wasn’t
a matter of a father forcing a son
into a football career.

“He came to football camp when
he was five years old,” remem-
bered his dad. “I was coaching
Sharpsburg High School. I think
that’s where he started to enjoy
football and the outdoors.”

Although both Cecconis will
have worn number 36 when their

careers are "over, and even though.

they will have both been running
backs, the Cecconis are not alike
in many ways.

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

Venzin will graduate f_rom Pitt
this year, and his absence will
hurt the team in more than one
way. Not only will his playing
skills be missed, but also his un-
yielding enthusiasm. The team
that gets-him, as a player Aorta
coach, will have a prize find.

how Haines is.

“A goalie is only as, good as his fullbacks,"
Haines remarked. "And our fullbacks are great.”

It’s true, the fullbacks are an integral part in
preventing goals, but when a- shot goes flying
into the nets all scrutinous eyes are usually focus-'
ed on the last man on the defense, the goalie.

So far this year Haines has only hadto re-'
trieve the ball from the nets only once in three
games. And that single goal came as a result of a
penalty kick called against the hooters in their

game against West Chester State.

Haines had absolutely no chance on the kick,
as is the -case for any goalie in a penalty kick.
and had a few words of digust on the-play.

“It was a poor call,” Haines said. “It shouldn’t
have been -a penalty at all. All a goalie can do
in that situation is pick a side of the net. dive.
and hope the ball comes that way. ”

Ironically, diving to block shots isn’t some-‘
thing that you see Haines do much of, not that he
doesn’t have to. Standing six feet two inches and‘
weighing an extemely solid 220 lbs., Haines covers
a great deal of the cage by just standing up and fac-

ing shots.

Another factor in the ‘junior’s favor is his ex-
ceptionally long reach. Haines canalmost effort-‘
lessly leap to the top of the goal cage,to deflect
shots ticketed for the top corners. Haines will
dive whenhe has to, but his size ‘always keeps him

in good position.

Last year Haines. played only the first few
games in a Pitt uniform before leaving the team
with an injured elbow. He then joined the Can-
onsburg entry "in the Keystone Soccer League
taking his team to the semifinals of the National

Open Cup Championship.

_ With a veteran defense in front of him, Haines
has really been tested . only «once so far .‘jn.__the ._
first three’ ga es. 'Last«_;Saturday.’ ’

 

The rather small. very dark
skinned Italian father is no physi-

cal match for his son, who took

after his tall blondmother.

Louis, as his father calls him,
has a light complexion, brownish
blond hair, and at six feet, 185
pounds is bigger than his father
ever hoped to be. He loves the out-
doors and has‘a boa constrictor as
aroommate.

Combing his jet black hair in.
the coaches locker room, Lou.
Sr. has something to say about
that.

"As long as he keeps that thing
away from me.” .

Though both men are rather
quiet, Lou the student has been
loud on the football field.

To date, he has run the ball 45.

Injuries Take Toll On Cats   

Very little. if anything. has been
going well for the Panther grid-
ders so far this season.

The Cats have dropped the first
four battles against their promi-
nent foes and the front line troops
are being downed with astounding
regularity.

Eight starters for the Panthers
have already fallen prey to that
dreaded evil — the injury —— and
other assorted hazzards.

The last in a long line of vic-
tims is senior linebacker George
Feher. Feher, a 6-1, 220 pound na-
tive of Aliquippa, was considered

be “a top backup man for the past -

two years” and since then has
successfully occupied a starting
position.

Last Saturday against North-
western at Pitt Stadium. how-
ever. the star lineman was se-
verely injured. Feher suffered an
injury to his knee. has since been
operated on and will be out for the
rest of the season.

The list of Panthers stricken
before the injury to Feher is cer-
tainly a disheartening one.

Even before the season was un-
derway the Cats were feeling the
bite into their starting lineup.

Junior fullback Paul Felinczak.
who was generally considered to
be a great asset in the new Pan-
ther Wishbone offense. sustained
an injury to his knee late in Aug-
ust during a scrimmage at fall
training camp. That injury was
enough to knock Felinczak out for
the entire season.

The first contest of the year
took its toll. on the Pitt Panthers
as the Cats lost the services of
three of their starters.

turned, defensive end, was lauded
as possibly “one of the nation’s
finest defensive ends.” This is
something Moss hasn’t been able
to prove—he hasn’t seen any ac-
tion since an injury to his knee. If
all goes well he may get his
chance as he is expected to return
for either the Navy or the Penn
State games.

The other two starters to exit
the same time as Moss were Er-
nie Webster and Rick Lozier.

Senior offensive tackle Webster
suffered a broken wrist while Lo-
zier. an offensive guard and tri-
captain of the team, suffered a
partial ligament tear in his knee.

The UCLA Bruins, on the sec-
ond game of the ’72 campaign,
were not to be denied their vic-
tim, and defensive tackle Dave
Jancisin was the most seriously
hurt in that contest with a hip-
pointer.

The Air Force Falcons were
content to just humiliate the Pan-
therslby downing them, 41-13. and

dis no serious damage to Pitt.

starters.

As if losing all these players to
injuries wasn't enough. the Cats
have lost two other starters for
different reasons.

Before the season even, began
junior halfback John Chatman de-
cided to forego football in order to
enable himself to concentrate
more fully on his future as a

wrestler.

Linebacker Lou Julian also drop-
ped out of the ranks as a Panther
gridder for personal reasons.

At this point what more could
happen to the Panthers? The an-
swer to that should come this
weekend at Tulane.

PROMlSES—PROMISES

The lighting an all-purpose
fields have not functioned
since the softball season last
year. Endless efforts have been
made to get the lights in op-
erating condition. However,
all attempts have resulted in
promises, excuses and burea-
cratic circumvention from our
University's Physical Plant.

We ask that all intramural
enthusiasts voice their concern
on this matter by calling the

In School And On The-lDia'mond

Martorelli Works Harder

Pete Martorelli, Pitt’s outstanding catcher, is
the product of an athletic oriented family and is
proud of it. ,

This pride is derived from Martorelli’s father
Mario, who is presently the Athletic Director of
the North Hills School System. It was his father who
introduced him to a variety of sports, but never at
any time forced him to participate in any of them.

From the time Martorelli was nine years old

' and learning to play baseball, he discovered that the

only way to be successful was to have confidence in
himself.

It was this confidence that helped him to main-
tain a .359 batting average last spring, making him
the second leading hitter on the Pitt squad. ‘

Martorelli, like many other mitters at this Uni-
versity, has had offers from many professional.
baseball teams. He realizes, however, that his fu-
ture would be quite bleak if he left college before
graduation and then could not make the grade in the
pros.

The sophomore catcher was a four year letter-
man in both baseball and football while attending
Kiski Prep. ' .

Martorelli received many scholarship offers
for his athletic prowess. After high school gradua-
tion he was seriously considering continuing his
football career at Marietta College. ‘

Because of his size, however, Martorelli de-
cided against pursuing a future on the gridiron’. He
is only ‘five 10, 190 pounds, a frame too small for
football but just right to propel a baseball.

Martorelli’s aspirations now are to follow in
the footsteps of his father. He would like to either

GET-TOGETHEII

Sat. Nite, Oct. 7

at 9:00 p.m.
' inthe

coach high school ball or join the ranks as a profes— -

sional baseball player.

The Panther mitter, however, realizes that all
this depends on howsuccessful he is with baseball
upon graduation.

At this point in Martorelli’s life, he is busily’
working toward being the best possible ballplayer
he can be.

While the star catcher is trying to perfect his
abilities behind the plate, he is also attempting to
acquire some valuable knowledge for either a future
in coaching or teaching.

Whatever may happen after graduation, an im-
portant fact of the situation will be a matter of how
much confidence Martorelli has in himself to ac-
complish what he sets out to do. -

“Confidence decideswhether or not you will
make it,” explained Martorelli in a tone that be-
trayed his own confidence.

It is not a statement of egotist but of an individ-
ual who is secure in his potential as a player.

An example of this was his reaction to a question
asked him about hitting slumps during his short
career as a Pitt mitter.

“I have had
slumps for may-
be a game or two
but that was the
extent of them,”
replyed the aston-
ished Martorelli.

After watching
him go three for
seven with eight
total bases, ’a
home run, and
two RBI’s so far
this fall; it is
easy to under-
stand his aston-
.ishment. '

ON NOV. I5 at the Pitt Field
House, the I972 edition of the
Pitt Panther basketball team
will give the student body an
idea of things to come, hope-
fully many bids.

The “sneak preview” will be
free of admission charge and
will start in the evening at 8
o'clock. There will be no op-
ponent, as the game will be an
intrasquad affair.
