Supreme Court

In just a few months, legal repre-
sentatives for The Pitt News, the
University’s independent student
newspaper, will find out whether their
on—going battle against Act 199 will be
heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The statute, passed in 1996, pro-

hibits The Pitt News andany other
schoo1—related publication from print-
ing “all alcoholic beverage and malt
beverage advertising.” It provides for
fines against any business advertising
alcohol within “any booklet, program

book, yearbook, magazine, newspaper, _

periodical, brochure, circular or other
similar publication published by, for or
in behalf of any educational institu-

On June 6, Witold Walczak, of the

Pittsburgh chapter of the American,

Civil Liberties Union and lead counsel

‘for The Pitt News, lost an appeal at the

Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
With a loss there, and after being

denied an en-banc_ hearing during‘

which an entire panel of judges would
examine the case, the-onlyremaining
option for the ACLU and The Pitt
News was to petition the U.S. Supreme
Court to hear the case.

“The only other place we can go is
up,’’ Walczak said. He expects that if
the court accepts the case in January —

' early by Supreme Court standards—— a

decision could be reached by April.‘If
the Court decides to hear the case later
than that, then it could not begin to
hear arguments until its next term,
beginning in October 2001. ,
The Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has been notified by the

Court that its response to The Pitt

News’ arguments is due by Dec. 15.
The suit stems from a 1997 inci-

. dent, during which the restaurant Fuel

& Fuddle was prosecuted under Act
199. A first-time violation carries a

fine of between $100 and $500 or
imprisonment for up to three months._

A second offense receives mandatory

L jail—time for a minimum of three

months.
The constitutional issue in the case
revolves around the First Amendment,

according to Walczak.

“The issue here is who decides
what gets printed in The Pitt News,” he
said. “lt’s all aimatter of control.”

He and the ACLU have asserted
that by dictating advertising within
The Pitt News, state legislators are
effectively dictating ‘content, and are
thereforein‘ violation of the First
Amendment which ‘guarantees free-
dom of the press.".’*’ ' , ‘ 0 .‘

Walczak has ‘argued that by elimi-
nating alcohol advertis'ing,;the length
of each issue.of‘VThe Pitt News is
effected, thereby affecting content. He
has also argued that the lost revenue
caused by the statute] limit_s the news-
paper’s ability to purchase new equip-
ment to ensure that it remains compet-
itive with other local newspapers.

Pitt News Editor in Chief Rehan
Nasir also mentioned ‘the importance
of competitiveness with local Weekly
papers; The City A Paper and
InPittsburgh Weekly, which regularly
publish drink specials. He said that
message boards and kiosks around
campus also contain. advertisements

. for alcoholic drink speeials.

“It’s ridiculous to that by our-
tailing specials in a college’ newspaper,
students will be less likely to drink,”
he said. “College students aren’t dumb.
They know where to go to get; what
they want.” V v

Representatives for the ‘common-
wealth, defending the statute, have
arguedlthat The Pitt News is ineligible
to assert the First Amendment rights of

third parties. The commonwealthr’

maintains that readers and advel isers
are capable of bringing suits them-
selves.

' In June, the court ;agreed, finding.

that “The Pitt‘ News lias not demon-
strated that the advertisers  or its
adult readers, have any impedi ent to

bringing their own suit to challenge the

statute.” V

Walczak disagrees, saying that
regardless of third parties, the statute
“directly impacts” content of The Pitt
News.

Nasir agrees. “I’rn offende that
the state thinks of us; as smallf irre-
sponsible children who don’t ,know
when to say when,” he said. i‘They
don’t respect us as a real newspaper.”

King hut

PizzaIHut in Schenley Cafe
praised for superior quality

CHRISTINA KEFALOS

Staff Writer

The Pizza Hut Express received
recognition for its outstanding qual-
ity of pizza and customer service on
Oct. 25.

With the team effort of six
employees running the busy sub-
unit, the restaurant managed to
acquire the highest level award pos-
sible —— platinum. ’

Jerry Miller, operations and
recognition specialist, said that the
employees of .the restaurant should
be proud. A

“They did it the best they coul
with the tools we gave them,” he
said.

The small express unit needed
to score between 96 and 100 to
receive the platinum award.

The unit was evaluated on ser-
vice, product quality, cleanliness
and overall operation.

“We base it on Pizza Hut stan-
dards. It takes a lot of time and
effort to move up,” Miller said. I

In the past, the highest level the
restaurant attained was gold, but
this year the team transcended pre-
vious ratings.

Pizza Hut employees made up a
list of items that needed more atten-
tion in order to achieve their goal.

Out of 186 Pizza Hut Express
units in Pittsburgh, Ohio and West
Virginia, 12 have reached platinum
level.

The times and dates of inspec-
tion are unannounced, so employees
must always be prepared.

Inspections happen about three
or four times a year, but can be less _

frequent if the rating is higher.

“The better they do, the less we
come around,” Miller said.

Abdou Cole, director of food
services of Schenley Cafe, said she
holds the Pizza Hut name to high
standards.

“It’s someone else’s name and
we have to take care of it,” Cole
said. _

The Pizza Hut Corporation has
a contract with the express unit in
the Schenley Cafe and expects the
restaurant to be run exactly the
same as the larger Pizza Hut restau-
rants are run.

The dough, sauce, application
of toppings, oven temperature and
cleanliness must coincide with larg-
er Pizza Huts.

Managers of the Pizza Hut sub-
units, like Cole, must go through a
three- to four-week training pro-
gram in Texas in order» to become
certified.

In turn, they train their employ-
ees under the same conditions.

The workers of the Pizza Hut

Express were individually recog-.

nized for the award and given a cer-
tificate of excellence" and a gift cer-
tificate to Giant Eagle.

Between 800 and l4,0()0 pizzas
are prepared each day at the restau-
rant.

“It’s one of our busiest coun-
ters,” Cole said.

Yellow comment cards at the
cashier’s station are available for
student’s questions, ideas and opin-
ions.

Cole said they always look for-
ward to hearing from students.

“We come in everyday and give
150%,” Cole said.

President and, co-founder
Mackens Audena said that the orga-
nization was designed to support
existing black groups and allow the
ideas of its members to come to
fruition.

“What makes us differen_t from
being just another organization is

Audena said. .“We’re like a fraterni-
ty or sorority without the Greek let-
ters.” .
According to Tehuti member
Jasma Rucker, the organization

originated when a handful of black 1

students at Pitt were displeased with
and vocally critical of existing
Greek organizations. They wanted
to form a similar enterprise. as the
Greek‘ system but within a more
Afrocentric context. 0

As a result, a band of students

-got together and began pooling

ideas for what would later become
Tehuti Maati Nu. By the time the
ideawas fully delineated and ready
to implement, the number of stu-
dents involved had dwindled to four.

 

These four students formally
introduced Tehuti to the Pitt com-
munity during the springsemester.
They recruited about 12 new mem-
bers to join.

“Right now we’re in our embryo
stage so we’re mainly» just focusing
on solidifying ourselves and setting
the foundation for whatever we may
pursue in the future,” said the
group’s treasurer and co-founder
Abimbolao Fakinlede.

Last semester Tehuti held a
panel discussion with the National
Pan-Hellenic Council to dispel" the
idea that a rivalry exists between the
twogroups. _

The event featured a lecture by

Vice Provost of Student Affairs Jack

Daniel, who serves as one of
Tehuti’s advisers.

Other ventures in which Tehuti
has taken part include a movie and
discussion held for Pitt’s FOCUS
group, a week—long trip to Detroit to
talk to elementary school students
and the creation of a black literary
magazine entitled Black Fire. ‘

rAs far as the future goes for
Tehuti, the group remains opti-
mistic, as they recently gained three
new members.

“It’s definitely a sacrifice,” said
Audena of his experience leading
Tehuti. “But we have to always keep

in mind those who sacrificed before '

us so that we can be where we are
now.” ‘
