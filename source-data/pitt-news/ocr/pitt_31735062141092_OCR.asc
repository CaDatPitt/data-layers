Ina Ray Hutton, we’ll have you
know, has nothing to do with mor-
ale-—nothing at all to do with
acceleration or deceleration, noth-
ing whatever to do with today’s
election. She never went to Pitt,
isn’t impressed very much with the
Cathedral or the nationality rooms,
and made no comment at all about
the signiﬁcance of the war to col-
lege students.

Therefore we decided  run her
.picture.

“The Morale is so excellent,’

 bawled Dr. Wan Allover, blowing
;f:.his nose into a Nazi Flag. “It’s

excellent, excellent, excellent.”

“What’s excellent?” we asked,
sitting on one of the Dr’s misplaced
AV-buttons.

“Morale. Honest it's oex‘c‘ellent,”
screamed Dr. Allover, as he press-
ed a button and into all classes
ﬁled 17 pairs of shell rimmed glass-
es wearing’ men and red-loin cloths,
carrying banners which read:
“Trounce Tojo,” “Harass Hirohi-
to” and “Stampede Schickelgrub-
er.” '

Turn.” V

He pushed another button. Leaf-

agressor is upon us,” they read. He
has burned our homes'——he has

our tires.

“Leaflets he’s passing out. Like
the Reds, and the paciﬁsts, and the
GDI’S, leaﬂets hes passing out.”
He‘ passed out.

We did too.

“And we hectrol him exclaim as «-

he faded from sight, “By God

all right.”

only said, “Looks pretty good up there under the
Gettysburg Address, doesn’t‘he. I’m going to take the

out of it.”

When asked whether he thought. there was 35
left in the University treasury, he cleaned out his
pockets on the ‘desk. There was $3.86 and a stu-
dent identiﬁcation card which he admits he ﬁlched
from a freshman to get to see a basketball game.

We begged the question.

That- raised the money on the desk to $4.09. .

The Chancellor begged the question. That raised
the take to a -little over $4.50. Damn little.

The Chancellor excused himself, and rang for his
secretary Miss Legagain. As she camein he beckoned
her over to a screen by the ﬁreplace.

A few minutes later the Chancellor issued from “

behind the screen.

“Uhhhh, Miss. Thgam n is feeling ill,” he mut-
tered, wiping the blood o his-undershirt. “But I got

another half buck.”

He tucked in his shirt, spat on the half buck, and
bounced it oil’ the desk. There was a leaden ring to .

the coin.
The Chancellors face fell.

All Tloroughthe Faculty Club

It was Faculty night in the Fac-
ulty club. Chancellor and Mrs.
Jongee Bonum were starting to
receive professors and their wives
and their wives’ children by for-
mer husbands in more foolish cir-
cumstances.

Mr. Neber, with a decided list to
the port side and a face lit up with
a four-rosy smile, sailed up to the
Chancellor, breathed heavily in
his face, murmured alcoholic apol-
ogies and slumped to the floor.

_M1-. Brupp, with an unmistak-
able tendency to ﬂounder on the
starboard _side, and a small pint
bottle beveled in his lip, bumped
into Mrs. Bonum, peeked her on
the hand and collapsed against her
surprised bosom.

Let’s get out of these wet clothes into 3
dry Martini
Mr. Spitzcurl, with an undeni-
able slump to the leeward side,
crawled up to the Chancellor, etc.

It was Faculty night in the Fac-
ulty club, and all the children hav-
ing been left to ﬁddle with the
elevators, the eating commenced
suddenly. Mrs. Bonum remarked
that she was simply famished and
that she wished to hell they would
get something better than the usu-
al slop. The Chancellor crippled
her temporarily with a rabbit
punch to the lumbar.

“Quiet, my dear,” he rasped, “you
want that I should be embarrass-
ec.” Soft whimpers were to be
rhhard fromiMjrs. Bonum. She ‘some-
. ?r__h and .. 

 

next time she opened her mouth,
the Chancellor would put her foot
in it. He did. .

De Boo has women on the copy desk

It was still night at the Faculty
club and the last dish had been
ground under foot. The Chancellor
rose to the situation and cleared
his throat right into Mrs. Spitz-
curl’s lorgnette. He shyly returned
from beneath his wife’s slip (The
old one with the lace and the al-
cohol stain) and cleared the table
by two feet.

“Dear members and non-paying
guests of the Faculty club, as you
all know we are assembled here
tonight rather roughly, the idea
in mind to celebrate ten years of
fraternity, brotherhood, equality,
and low salaries,” was the way
the head of the University was
supposed to begin.

When he came to the comma fol-
lowing non-paying guests he was
supposed to clear his throat mean-
ingfully and somebody was sup-
posed to cast a half-dollar onto the
now scarred and battered table. He
started to clear his throat and then
caught himself in time. Mrs. Spitz-
cur1’s lorgnette was nowhere to be
seen. ‘

The Chancellor recovered him-
self in time to catch, not a half-
dollar, but a. two-bit piece full in
the left ear. .

Something considerably worse
than hell broke loose on Faculty
night in the Faculty, ’

contribution came from his wife
who wanted to start the ball roll-
ing, as it were. Later after the
stretcher bearing” Mrs. Bonum had
departed, he remarked in a sor-
rowful voice that he did not mind

. the small sum of money but he re-

sented the spirit in which it ‘was
presented to him, i.e., full in the
left ear.

Meanwhile, irrespective of the

room, the non-paying guests sid-

Seeking to sabotage the war
program, the University went on
a “deceleration” program. .

“We’re getting tired of ‘hurry-
ing,” stated Provost Tuofus Blitz-
terald, during his siesta. .

“I always was a slow. sort of

. fellow,” 'drawled Chancellor Juan

Gabble Showman, picking up last
Sunday’s comics.

The University will attempt to
crawl through one semester’s work
in ‘"13 or 14 months, at the in-
side,” ‘an unusually unreliable
source high in administration quar-
ters was prompted to say‘ by en'-
other source high in quarters.

The last ‘mentioned source laid
down three dozen‘ quarters on "N7,

the number for the last seven days. V

Class hours have been rearrang-
ed to make the regular class hour
26 hours long. “We are seriously
considering changing the number
of hours in a day,” sadly nodded
Mitzperald. “But we’re running in-
to trouble with the prysics profs.
They say it can’t be done.”

He took me aside. We stepped “

up into the second shelf of his
bookcase. “But that’s what they
said to Galileo, daVinci, and Ford.
And look what they got.” ‘ V

We reminded him that two of .»

them were dead. . .
The, second shelf of the book-

case swung back from the wall, 3 ;

“Ha, that’s what you think.” he
sneered.

As we piled out of the office, we —

bumped into a gee named Pock-
ley, who, it is generally supposed,
will run the “deceleration”
gram . . . into the ground.

He took us aside. “Ya wanna I

know what this deceleration pro’.
gram is all about. Well I'll tell
you.” . . , ,

“Weﬁgure that if any more col-
lege men get’ into the Army,‘the
Allies will lose as sure as my name
is Sehickley.” He consulted a small
memorandum book. “Make that
Mockley.” .

-“What about the ﬁfth race?"»
we queried. ’ 

“Who’s running?” .

We sidetracked Pockley at Hia
leah and went on to a meeting of
the Special Deans Committee on
Slowing Down Education.

Dean Hawford, chairman of the
committee, adjusted his spectacles,
then his ears, then readjusted his
spectacles. “Keep falling off; worst
pair of ears I ever bgught.” ’

Under the new accelerated pro.
gram present seniprs can graduate
in another two years, present juni.
ors can hang on, if they try real
hard, for another ﬁve; sophomores
can just try and get out in less
than ﬁfteen, and present freshman,
when graduated, will be prepared
to prove the old adage “Life be.
gins at Forty.”

ing With the waiters, Wl'1O sided Helen Drools slush

with the faculty, who sided with
the Chancellor. Needless to say
Mrs. Bonum was on the opposing
side and went stoutly down the
elevator shaft ﬁghting stoutly.

Silence was kept for two min-
utes, until the last screams of Mrs.
Bonum had faded away.

“Friends,” continued the Chan-
cellor, “before I was interrupted,
I-" A twenty-ﬁve cent piece clip-
ped him full in the right eye this
time, and something deﬁnitely
worse than hell broke loose once
again.

there on his person, guests ex-

We agreed with him.-

“Its this way, he shrieked. You
see we’re really not building a

Snapping her girdle in time to a
hot version of The Coronation
March, senior queen-elect Kerns
Flatt was dragged to the throne
byiher two aides and there grac-
iously plopped down.

As photographers posed the
queen in seductive positions on the
chandeliers, the ,Commons Room
fires, and the provost’s lap, Lean”
(Quick-an-aspirin) Jinx was seen
beating her head against Miss
Blush’s breast and mumbling, “lt's
‘Hell, ain't it?” .

In another corner, Dr. Standin
'A.,'Crowfoot, bore up under the
congratulatory kisses of frustrated
female members of the faculty who
were heard to exclaim ‘‘Haven’t
had so much fun since the treasur-
er got his eyelash caught in the
chancellor’s keyhole.”

lOn the face of it, the senior
queen was an unhappy choice. Miss
‘Flatt, who has maintained a six
point average, at least, is the out-
door type, abhors excessive make-

up, relies solely on- a paste made

of oatmeal, egg-yolks, and nitro-
glycerin. “I knock myself out with
that stuff,” she claims.

Kerns is the honest type of a gal
who, twhen you ask her about her
outside interests, replies, V“Me? Oh,
I'm one of those disgusting people
who have no hobbies. That is, out-
side of the cultivation of my little

' patch of hashish.”

Alma Mater, who was picking the
cuticle off her big toe when the
aides discovered her in the crowd,
stood~up and declared. “Now,.,not
too fast, girls. Miss Mushgmay still
chage -her -mind.»’3 A

We peeked into the Chancellors
office last Monday.
Dixon discusses “Lazy Fairy”

That left eye, Doc Churlson says,
will heal in a year or two. “Just

_ keep this cloth damp.’

Stotz sips suds

Well, holding our left eye in our
right hand, we pushed the chancel-
lor into a chair.

So we withdrew to the drawing room and
drew a few beers

“Sit down,’ he said, sitting down.

We sat down. The rug was real
soft. Like tissue paper. Thin too,
like tissue paper. We tore off a
piece and stuck it in our pocket,
remembering the National Defense
Paper Saving campaign.

“The two wooden covers (plas-

they can be easily converted into"

other innovation is the injection of
baby termites into the wood to pre-
vent my successor ‘(a number one

on next year’s Howl. Of course
these two innovations I have just

A People . are never satisﬁed, especially us. Last night I
turned to my father under the table and said, “Pop.” He said
no, Haig and Haig, son. . . All of which reminds me of a story.

  

One day, while sitting in the News office, starting runs‘

in girls stockings, the phone rings. Well, I thought nothing
of that for the telephone often rings in the ofﬁce. As stories

usually go, the call was for me.

“Hello.” “Hello.” After a lengthy pause, the monotony
got him and he sputtered, “Zelenski?” I'm the cautious type,
besides her father’s looking for me so I said, “Who wants Ze-
lenski?”

“Haig ’n Haig speaking: Willyou tell that bum, Zelen-
ski, that I wasn’t giving that football player money, he was
lending it to me.” muttering over and over again to himself,
thinks he's going to graduate, huh, as he hung up.

I then rushed right out and rubbed out the W0 from
the door of the men’s room.

V Later I was administering the seventh lash to a cub re-

porter who was hollering something about the rights of man

when the phone rang again.
. i 1' You’re right, it was for me. Deep soulful sobs greeted
me over the phone. “This is Frank Carver,” the person snif-
ﬂed. While ﬂicking ashes on the campus editor’s head, I said
in a comforting voice, “Take it easy, Mr. Carver.”

“Here I go, losing hair by the handfuls, building up an
int_i_'_amural program, and what happens, you, in one day, tear
it down. You ‘damn fool, you forgot to print the schedule, no-
body’: up : here.” V ’

As the receiver was going down, I heard him wildly sob,
0! Zelenski, I'm so lonely. ‘ ; .

' Getting back to my desk, I wildly attacked my layout
sheet. Dropping picas here and ems there, things began to
pick up. But not for long. A little fellow behind a big mustache
stomped up to my desk, whipped out a knife, and shouted,
“Zelenski you’re through.” _ V

I quietly collapsed, saying, “No, please, Mr. Olson.”
When I was revived I found a note, written in my own blood,

_ saying, “Contrary to the results of the track meets, and the

opinion of the public, we have the greatest track team in the
country.” Signed Brother Olson. _
Sports Editor Zelenski was last seen trying to crawl into
the top left hand drawer of his desk, screaming, “People can’t
tell me how to live.’’

“Well, it’s not for publication,

Dorothy Lamour has the most fa-

.tiguing curve that he has ever

seen.

While gently siphoning a mag-
nun of blood from a member of the
basketball team, the not-so-good
doctor promised that his 1942 edi-
tion of the Panther basketball team
would go into spring training with
Miss Lamour. He went on to ex-

_plain that with Dorothy Lamour

the ball players could get a better
grasp of the situation.
(Ed. Note:—-It’s bound to stimu-

-late something or other.)

“Of course both Haig and Haig
and ‘Gabby’ Bowman objected at
first, but after viewing the lay of
the land, they thought it was a
great move. It was further pointed
out that this lwould be the only
form of subsidization.”

Tennis Squad Begins Practice Sessions

Pitt Riflers Place Tenth

In National Tournament

Pitt’s marksmen suffered two se-
vere blows last Saturday in the in-
tercollegiate National Riﬂe asso-
ciation tournament held at Annap-
olis, Maryland.

In the first place, the Blue and
Gold entry failed to live up to ex-
pectations, ending in 3- tie for
tenth position. The second and
perhaps the most unexpected blow
was the downfall of Captain Larry
La Spada, who last year came
within one position of making the
all-American rifle team.

La Spada, a consistent 280
shooter, faltered badly in his quest
for national recognition. His 276
was not even good enough to take
his own team’s honors, for gunmate
Bruno Cengia came through with
a 279.

The top four teams to place were
Lehigh, Maryland, Navy, and Penn
State. Lehigh, with a grand total
of 1,393 points, took the regional
honors. Pitt’s score was 1,348, one
of the lowest it has made this sea-
son.

Murdy Leads

Bowling Tourney

The Pitt News Duckpin tourna-
nlent lnoves into the ﬁnal round

this week with ten men ﬁghting it
out for top honors.

The ﬁnal round qualiﬁers were
led by Dick Murdy, M43, ’who roll-
ed a three ‘game score of 567. This
total placed him seventeen full pins
ahead of his nearest rival. Jack
Henning, who tossed a 550 score.

  

With ﬁve lettermen back from
last season’s squad and 12 new as-
pirants hopeful of gaining regular
positions, Charles “Doc” Hartwig,
Pitt’s assistant tennis mentor, has
been meeting with this year’s out-
ﬁt prior to starting outdoor prac-
tice. The local net season gets un-
derway two weeks from this Sat-
urday and the schedule arranged
for this year is the most attrac-
tive in many seasons.

Last year the Panther netters
were able to show only ﬁve wins
in 10 starts, but with ﬁve experi-
enced men back the outlook for
the coming season is brighter. The
five returning tennis players. are
Henry Grance, Dick Trimble, Jack
Wynn, Bill Reese, and Bob Nicke-
son. Of the 12 new men out for
the squad eight will be retained.

Of the 14 games on the schedule
only ﬁve are home battles. Opening

day finds the Blue and Gold netlexﬁ
in Columbus facing Ohio State.-
Three home games follow and the!‘
the locals engage Indiana Teachers
on the latter’s courts. A few days
later the Panthers travel to West
Point to battle the Army.

A honle contest with Penn State
is followed four more games abroad,
the Pittmen
Tech, Georgetown, George.Wash-
ington, and Navy on successive
days. The ﬁnal home match ﬁnds
West Virginia here, and then the
season is closed against Slippery
Rock and Grove City at those two
schools.
