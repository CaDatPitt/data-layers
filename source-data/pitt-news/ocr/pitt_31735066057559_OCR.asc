Mike Doyle addresses crime to UDs

By LeeAnne Mitchell
For The Pitt News

While discussing his platforms of

economic development and lowering
crime rates, 18th Congressional
District Democratic candidate Mike
Doyle spoke to the University
Democrats last night about how he
hopes to change Congress if elected in
November.
. “We need to do something to lower
the crime rates in the communities in
our area. Although the obvious answer
is to put the offenders in jail and leave
them there for a long time, someone
has to take the opposite side of doing
something to prevent crime,” he said.

Doyle said he wants to put more
money into programs that would tar-

get at risk families and children and,
in that way, to keep them out of the
crime system.

“Until we pump more money into
the community to stop crime before it
starts, we are going to have to face the
fact that we are going to be building
prisons for ever and ever,” Doyle said.

Working together to decrease crime
is necessary to develop the economy
of this area. Doyle said we need to
attract more businesses into the
Pittsburgh area and suburbs.

.“I have a son in college and two oth-
ers in junior high. I would like them to
be able to have jobs once they get out.
We have to attract companies to this
area in order for this to be able to hap-
pen. And by attracting more compa-

Master Space
Plan to be
released soon

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

Over the next five years, Pitt plans to -.

expand Hillman Library, build a convoca-
tion center and begin renovation on Pitt
Stadium football facilities among other
projects, according to a draft of Pitt’s
Master Space Plan. ‘

The Master Space Plan describes Pitt’s
campus construction and improvement
plans and divides them into short-range,
mid-range and long-range goals.

The time approximation is ﬁve years for
the completion of short—range goals, ten
years for mid-range and twenty years for
long-range, said Thomas Andersen, co-
chairman of the Plant Utilization and
Planning Committee, or PUP.

PUP began working on the Master Space
Plan three years ago, Andersen said,

because the city required and the university

recognized the need for space planning,
Andersen said. Over the past year and a
half, representatives from PUP have met
with some community groups to exchange
ideas about the Master Plan.

The community groups voiced concerns
about traffic congestion and student off-
campus housing, said Robin Jones, chair-
man of a subcommittee for PUP,
Community Involvement in a Master Plan,
or CIMP.

“The community is not that interested in
the Hillman Library expansion or in the
Belleﬁeld Annex renovation,” said Jones.
“But there are other things that they do that
they need to tell [the community] about.”

These things include projects that will
increase traffic congestion in Oakland, she
said.

Community groups, representative of
residential and commercial areas, met with
representatives from PUP every other
week, Jones said. They discussed copies of
the latest draft of the Master Plan during
their meetings and gave suggestions.

Some suggestions were not incorporated
into the plan, Jones said. Many members
of community groups don’t want Pittto
build the convocation center. Pitt, however,

CR speaker says Democrats in power too long

By Amy Fink
Staff Writer

The speaker at last night’s
College Republicans meeting
described the Democratic party
as “one party, in power, too
long.”

“Republicans have the power
to change the direction of
Allegheny County,” said
Lawrence Dunn, Allegheny
County Commissioner.

He was awarded with
applause after he said that the
Democratic machine had been
in too long and that it thinks it
owns the county.

“The media is finally listening
to the Republican side, and we
have to have media that’s fair
and listens to what we have to
say,” said Dunn.

Democrats have a strong hold
in Allegheny County. Torn
Foerster has been re-elected for
years, and Pete Flaherty pro-
motes his own decisions and
opinions, according to Dunn.

Nobody was really willing to
fight the Democratic party. Now,
however, a recent Republican
county chair wants to fight
Foerster and the Democrats,
according to Dunn.

Jarrod Caruso, vice president

of the College Republicans said,
“We chose the county commis-
sioner to speak tonight because
he is the person responsible for
the distribution of funds
throughout the county, and he’s
the only man with high enough
power to refute Flaherty and
Foerster.”

Dunn was opposed to the
increase of sales tax and against
the opening of the new
Pittsburgh International Airport.
According to Dunn, Allegheny
County has the second-highest
business tax in America, and the
new airport does not provide
enough business.

Eliminating property taxes is
one of the many things towards
which Dunn said he is working.
The property tax is based on a
person’s dwelling when origi-
nally built, but, because of larger
homes being built and other fac-
tors, the assessments rise.

According to Dunn, this is
something he would like to see
on the ballot for which the peo-

-ple can vote.

According to both the presi-
dent and vice president of the
College Republicans, guest
speakers provide a way to get
more people on campus focused
on conservative ideals.

NEW DELHI, India —
India’s plague outbreak
has spread, to the capital,
carried by two men who ﬂed
the distant western city of
Surat to escape the deadly
disease, health officials said
Tuesday.

The two were among
11 people being treated

for plague symptoms at

De1hi’s Infectious Disease
Hospital, the city’s health
minister, Harsh Vardhan,
said.

The two confirmed plague
victims, aged 28 and 30,
were among more than
300,000 people who have
fled plague-infested Surat
over the past few days, head-

President Clinton welcomed
Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to the White House
Tuesday, saying the old
superpower rivals now meet
“not as adversaries but as

Yeltsin, meeting Clinton

Canada, in April 1993,
replied through a translator
that the United States “is a
strong partner and not an

Yeltsin arrived from

nies and more jobs, we lower
the unemployment rate, and
the crime rate will also
drop,” he said.

As of a September poll,
Doyle said he has » a
“double digit” lead. He said
that while the race is going
well, he has already dealt
with the mudslinging of
his opponent, McCarty. He
has accused Doyle of
remaining on the Senate pay-
roll while campaigning for
Congress.

“I guess when you tell a lie
over and over, Iguess that
some people will believe it. I

have to assume that most
people will find out the truth,
and the truth is that I
have been on an unpaid leave
of absence from the Senate
for quite a long time. lt’s an
easily proven fact,” Doyle
said.

If elected, Doyle would
also like to do something to
change the seniority system
that is in place in Congress.
He said there needs to be a
networking system so that
newer, fresher ideas can
emerge.

“Congress now is under a
seniority system. You have to
be there for twenty, thirty

years to become a chairman
of a committee, which is
where the real power lies.
The problem is that people
who are there that long are
becoming burnt out, cynical
and sometimes even corrupt.
I would definitely like to see
a new system implemented,”
Doyle said.

In other University
Democrats news, there will
be a voter registration drive
in which tables will be set up
in the lower level of the
William Pitt Union on
Monday, Tuesday and Friday
and in the Towers lobby on
Wednesday and Thursday.

wants to build it and has includ-
ed it in the Master Plan.

But other suggestions were
included in “the spirit of the
plan,” Jones said, including rec-
ommendations for more student
housing on campus and better
traffic and pedestrian circula-
tion.

One suggestion is to close
Bigelow Boulevard to traffic,
enabling pedestrians to walk
from the Cathedral of Learning
to the William Pitt Union with-
out having to compete with
cars.

But the chances of such a clo-

sure happening “at this time, are
slim to none,” Andersen said.
Andersen said the Master
Plan at least recognizes the
problem. The next step will be
to consider how to solve the
problem.

Other projects included in
Pitt’s short-range goals include
building a multi—purpose acade-
mic complex, a home for the
College ._ of Business
Administration and a Children
and Youth Center addition to
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic (WPIC).

Andersen said the Master
Space Plan is not comprehen-

sive, because it hasn’t taken
Pitt’s academic plan into
account. Pitt’s academic plan
would include the university’s
plans to enlarge some depart-
ments.

For example, “the geology
department —— will it grow
or shrink?,” Andersen ques-
tioned. The present draft of the
Master Space Plan does not
provide for these variables, he
said.

Pitt’s Master Space Plan and
the academic plan will both be
presented at the board of
trustees meeting on Oct. 21,
said Leon Haley.

Assault concerns Pitt

Over the past couple of days, articles in The Pitt News have
demonstrated the lack of cooperation between the’Campus
Women’s Organization and the Department of Public Safety on
the issue of sexual assault. CWO is disturbed by what it feels
was casual treatment of a sexual assault on the part of Public
Safety. We are not here to pass judgement on this controversial
issue, but we find it very disconcerting that these two organiza-
tions have a problem working together. 8 4

Sexual assault is a very serious issue at Pitt. If this campus is
ever to be made truly safe for women, CWO, Public Safety and
other campus organizations, such as Sexual Assault Services
and Student Government Board, must work together.

The Pitt News believes these organizations should get togeth-
er and attempt to coordinate a coherent and holistic policy to
deal with the threat of sexual assault on campus. If these organi-
zations worked together rather than apart and against each
other, more effective policy changes could be initiated. ~

We wish to congratulate Public Safety Director Rick Boyd on
the progress he hasjalready made in his brief two weeks in
office. Public Safety has issued a guarantee to all victims of
sexual assault, assuring them of privacy, confidentiality, sensi-
tivity and support. The guarantee includes a willingness to meet
with victims at a place of their choice in the local area, full
confidentiality, medical assistance and‘"a full investigation, of
which the victim will be kept up to date. It is very encouraging
that Director Boyd has made such an important policy addition
so soon after taking over as director. 8

Public Safety’s guarantee is an important step in the care of
victims of sexual assault. However, more must be done to pre-
vent assault. We feel this can best be accomplished by coordina-
tion of purpose and action. CWO, Public Safety, Sexual Assault
Services and SGB all have a vested interest in decreasing the
threat of rape on campus. To make real progress, though, they
must all work together and target different policies for different
aspects of rape. For example, there is a major difference
between protecting against’ sexual assault and protecting against
date or acquaintance rape. An escort service could go a long
way toward protecting women from assault on the streets of
Pittsburgh, but it will do little to decrease the threat of date
rape. O I 

The Pitt News suggests the implementation of a formal escort
service and the co-sponsoring of seminars on‘ women’s safety
on campus so as best to achievestudent participation. These
changes can best be implemented by a joint policy wherein the
resources of CWO, Public Safety, Sexual Assault Services and
SGB are united toward a common goal. A perfect example tobe

followed is tonight’s seminar on personal protection by Debbie _

Gardner at 8:30 in the William Pitt Union, co-sponsored by
SGB, the Office of Student Activities, _ the Officeof Public and
Student Affairs and the Department of Public Safety. If these-
organizations insist on working independently it will result in
much less efficient changes, if any are made at all.

Imagine being president of a country whose fate
was determined by others. President Jean—Bertrand
Aristide was not given the opportunity to voice his
concern over the agreement made between Jimmy
Carter and Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras last weekend.
This agreement states that Cedras will leave his
office on Oct. 15, 1994 and that Aristide will be
restored, but does not make any reference to the
fate of the Haitian military, police force or the
FRAPH (the Front for the Advancement and
Progress of the Haitian People). It is these organi-
zations that are behind all of the violence and ter-

ror that has plagued Haiti for the past three years.

Cedras is only part of the problem, and even if he
does step down on the set date, the Haitian rnili—
tary and other paramilitary groups will still exist. It
was these groups who killed any visible supporter
of Aristide, or raped women supporting. Aristide
while forcing their children to watch. These peo-
ple even went as far as to force young boys to rape

V their mothers, all of which has been documented. 1
This is the reality of the Haitian military. To fur-

ther this situation, the U.S. administration stated
that_it is not their intent to dismantleor disarm
these groups. So the terror will continue.
Naturally, one must wonder why the U.S., which
has seen the evidence against the military, is so
reluctant to dismantle it. Fear of another foreign
policy mistake? Or is it because of the long-stand-

Reader questions Haitian policy  

ing ties between the U.S. and the Haitian military?
Raoul Cedras_has been a U.S. intelligence source
for years and has been on the CIA payroll.
Aristide is justified in doubting the validity? of the
new accord. Cedras isn't requiredto leave Haiti.
There is talk that he will remain and run for elec-
tions next year. How can democracy come to a
country when criminals are running free with no
restrictions whatsoever? Will Aristide be safe
when he returns to Haiti? The agreementihas
already been created. The main task is to disman-
tle the Haitian army. They should not be relied on
to help ease the transition between the de facto

8 government and legitimate Haitian government. A ,

They are as guilty as the military leaders of the
crimes against their own people. This was easily
seen in last week’s activities, ‘where the Haitian‘
people were attacked by their military as they
expressed their joy that Aristide was returning,
while the international peace—keeping force merely

watched. The international community must real- P

ize the "danger of leaving the military intact and

work together to create an alternative immediately. ‘

In fact, getting Cedras to leave office is only one
small step. The larger task is still confronting us,
whether Haitian or not.‘

SGB member ondefense seminar

While I was very pleased to
see that The Pitt News men-

‘ tioned the Debbie Gardner Self-

Defense Seminar as an item of
business at the September 22,
1994 Campus Women’s
Organization meeting, I was dis-
heartened to see that once again,
a reporter’s misinterpretation of

the facts can shed a negative .

light on a crucially important
subject. The Pitt News reporter
Chris Kocher wrote in his
September 26, 1994 “CWO Not
Happy...” article regarding the
self-defense seminar, “Mania
said similar seminars in the past
have attracted few people but
hope that this one will be differ-
ent.’5 Unfortunately, this mis-
quoted statement diminishes the
importance of the program,
implying that it is no different
than past self-defense seminar
attempts, when in fact, it bears
no similarity to previous semi-
nars.

Debbie Gardner has a totally
new message on personal pro-

tection, ‘designed for both men
and women. Shetakes an enter-
taining and dynamic approach to

self—defense, emphasizing the

importance of self—empower-
ment and the rightto live freely,
even in an urban environment.
Debbie will give seminar partici-
pants realistic tools to survive

violence, including armed

attacks.‘ .
Unlike past attempts to pro-
vide Pitt students, faculty and
staff with self-defense infonna—
tion, this nationally-acclaimed
program is being.co—sponsored
by students and administrators,
including the Student
Government Board, the Office
of Student Activities, the Office

of Public and Student Affairs

and the Department of Public
Safety. The combined efforts of
these offices should be recog-
nized as a welcomed attempt at
providing quality services to the
Pitt community. Yet another uni-
versity office, the Department of
Food Services, recognizing the

importance of personal protec-
tion, will help entice participants
by providing free refreshments
following the seminar.

The efforts of numerous stu-
dent groups and administrators
to make this seminar a success
should not be ‘dismissed as just
another attempt at the same old
subject. I would like to extend a

» challenge to both The Pitt News
and the university community: -
accept responsibility for your

safety. Take advantage of the
opportunity to attend an exciting
and completely innovative self-
defense seminar, totally free of
charge. Don’t miss Debbie
Gardner’s seminar tonight at
8:30 p.m. in the William Pitt

Heisman
belongs

 

Columnist endorsement

Brady to Alcom
Slater State quarter-

back Steve
McNair.

McNair is the latest in a recent
line of gaudy-numbered quarter-
backs to tickle the brains of
today’s banal Heisman voters.

Considering how the post-col-
legiate careers of NFL ﬂops
Andre Ware, Ty Detmer, Gino
Torretta, and NFL jilt Charlie
Ward have taken the luster out of
an award allegedly given to col-
lege football’s best player,
there’s no way it should be given
to a quarterback making his hay
in Division I-AA.

It’s just too bad that McNair
may be the best player in college
football.

But at least Ware, Detmer,
Torretta and Ward put up their
numbers while playing for some
elite teams, against some of the
nation’s best teams and in some
of the biggest games.

McNair’s stats (441 passing
yards, four TDs a game) are
coming against the likes of
Grambling, Tennessee-
Chattanooga, Alabama State and
Sam Houston State, and through
those first four games his club is
only 2-2.

It might be better for McNair
that he not be associated with
those past Heisman quarterbacks
anyway. Consider that the four
most effective NFL quarterbacks
drafted in the 1990s are non-
Heisman winners Jeff George,
Craig Erickson, Drew Bledsoe
and Rick Mirer.

It’s time for a meat and‘pota-
toes Heisman. It’s time to get
back to the roots of Heisman.

In other words, it’s time, hell,
it’s way past time for a running
back to win the Heisman.

The last time a running back
captured the voters was in 1988,
when Oklahoma State’s Barry
Sanders won the award after
leading the nation with 2,628
yards.

Running backs used to reign «
the nameplate of John W.
Heisman’s trophy.

Backs like O.J. Simpson, Tony
Dorsett, Earl Campbell, Billy
Simms, Marcus Allen and Bo
Jackson were frequent visitors of
the Downtown Athletic Club.

That was until the voters got
caught up in inﬂated passing sta-
tistics, which cost Marshall
Faulk the 1992 award which
went to Toretta, and all-purpose
yardage (see Tim Brown and
Desmond Howard).

McCullough may miss season
Guard injures knee in pickup game

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

One week after losing
power forward Willie Cauley
to academics,
the Pitt men’s
basketball
team may
lose the ser-
vices of its
best player,
Jerry McCullough.

McCullough, the senior
point guard, seriously injured
his left knee while playing
basketball Monday and was
spotted yesterday walking
with the aid of crutches.

Pitt officials say there is a
possibility that McCullough’s
injury could be season—ending,
which would prevent him
from competing in 1994-95.

“There is a suspicion it may
be,” Assistant Athletic
Director Larry Eldridge said.

Preliminary observations by
Pitt trainers and an MRI test
conducted yesterday proved
that McCullough has “some
damage” to knee cartilage and
his anterior cruciate ligament.

McCullough injured his
knee while playing pick-up
basketball with teammates.

“Apparently, he planted the
wrong way, and I guess it just
crumbled,” Eldridge said. “It’s
a freaky thing.” ,

“He got the ball and went
up, like he normally does,”
Pitt forward Orlando Antigua
said. “When he went up, his
knee buckled on him, and he
yelled really loud.”

McCullough will seek the
opinion of a surgeon on
Thursday to determine if the

injury demands an operation
or can be repaired through
rehabilitation.

“We didn’t think it was seri-
ous. I thought he might be out
like a week when it first hap-
pened,” Antigua said.

Last year, McCullough was
the second-leading scorer for
Pitt with 13.3 points per game.
He led the Panthers in assists
with 175 and in steals with 70.

McCullough is currently

school’s all-time steals list.
In 1992-93, McCullough led

”Pitt in scoring with 15.3

points per game and was a

selection.

If McCullough is forced to

“It’s gonna affect the team

a chance.”

The general consensus
around the Big East, now that
Pitt’s mega-star Ann Marie
Lucanie has graduated, is that
all teams have a shot.

“Without Ann Marie
Lucanie, Pitt is more vulnera-
ble,” Shulte said.

Even so, Pitt was ranked
first in the Big East preseason
coaches poll, with the Seton
Hall Pirates in a close second.

After playing the top two
teams in the nation, Pitt’s
schedule, strength and experi-
ence make it a favorite, but
some coaches believe that
Seton Hall could break the
Panthers’ streak.

“This could be Seton Hall’s
year,” Connecticut coach
Ellen Crandall said.

But Seton Hall’s coach,
Stephanie Hoening, doesn’t
want to admit that just yet.

“I couldn’t tell you right
now,” Hoening said, “because
I haven’t seen any of the
teams play.”

Although Seton Hall hasn’t
played an extremely tough
schedule, it still has an
impressive 13-2 record. The
Pirates are led by All-
Conference selections Baiba
Zake, who is leading the Big
East in kills with 209, and six-
foot-two—inch middle blocker
Perette Arrington, who is third
in blocking average per game.
Ar1ington’s total of 34 aces is
also the highest so far.

Seton Hall also possesses
the Big East’s top blocker, 6-
foot—l-inch Silvia Watson.

“We’re playing real well
right now,” Hoening said. “We
have a winning record.”

Connecticut was rated third
by the coaches in the.presea—
son poll, and it is living up to
its expectations with a 12-2
record. Last year, the Huskies
posted 28 wins, a high mark in
school history.

UConn is banking on a big
year from last season’s Big
East Rookie of the Year

Crew
shoves off
at Head
of Ohio

 

By Robert M. Beecroft
For The Pitt News

The Pitt crew team kicks off
its 1994 fall campaign on
Saturday when it races in the
annual Head of the Ohio.

Pitt has 18 entries in the race
and is excited by the prospect
of victory.

The Head of the Ohio is a
form of boat racing known as
a head race. In a head race, the
competing boats race against
the clock rather than each
other.

The race is host to various
different types of boats rang-
ing from high schools to the
U.S. and Canadian national
teams.

“This is the only formal
regatta in the Pittsburgh area
for college crews,” head coach
John Dougherty said. “We are
very happy to have the oppor-
tunity to show people at home
what we have and what we can
accomplish.”

The race begins at 8:30 a.m.,
and Pitt will have a hospitality
tent set up from 8:45 to 3:00.
The best view of the finish line
will be from Roberto
Clemente Park, and parking is
available at Three Rivers
Stadium.

The men’s team will be led

said.

The Villanova Wildcats
return five starters from their
26-9 season last year.
Villanova turned some heads
in the Big East when it fin-
ished fourth. .

Collectively this year,
Villanova is first in team-hit-
ting percentage, assists and
kills, most of which come
from Mara Austrins, outside
hitter, and middle blocker
Amy Burke, both seniors. But
the big surprise for head coach
Ron Twomey is 6-foot fresh-
man Stacey Evans, who leads
conference players in hitting
percentage (.429), blocking
and kills per game. Evans’
play reflects the Wildcats 11-2
record.

“It’s very hard to say who’s
the best team,” Boston College
coach Nadine Lilavois said,
“because everyone has a shot.”

Although Syracuse had a
dismal 13-21 record last year,
Shulte is optimistic.

“We’re on the rise,” Shulte
said. “We have the capability,
we’re doing real well.”«

With eight freshmen and
sophomores on the roster,
Syracuse will look to its senior
co—captains Angie Casazza, a
6-foot-3-inch middle blocker,
and setter Tina Grasselli.

Georgetown, 9-8 this sea-

the depths of mediocrity. The

ing back, however. Sophomore
Knut Saeter, starting his first
game of the season, scored
with a header that got by Kane
at 33:20 into the first half.
Fellow sophomore Matt Schell
assisted on the goal with a
crossing pass from the left
side. Kane finished the game
with four saves.

Saeter was not done for the
day. Just 1:30 later, he scored
again, his third score of the
season, to send Pitt into half-
time with a 2-1 lead.

St. Bonaventure tied the
game 20:55 into the second
half with a goal from Craig
Cassler.

The shot taken from outside
the box got past Spitzer, who
also had four saves for the day.

The game was a very physi-
cal one. Five yellow cards
were handed out, including
three to the Panthers. Saeter,
Jason Piombino and J.L.
Gorsin picked up the cards for
Pitt.

Also, there were 31 fouls
called against the two teams,
16 of them against the
Panthers.

The two teams remained tied
through the first overtime peri-
od and into the second, until
Porter’s goal put the Panthers
ahead to stay.

“Goalie is unsettled, as are
10 other positions on the
field,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said on Sunday,
‘after the loss to Villanova.

Luxbacher followed through
on his threat yesterday and
brought changes to the lineup
that proved to be the needed
ingredients for the Panthers.

Piombino, Schell and Saeter
received rare starts, and Spitzer
returned to the goal, replacing
Kirk Brodows. Schell, Saeter
and Spitzer all played pivotal
roles in the Panthers’ win.

By breaking its three game
losing streak; Pitt’s record now
stands at 4-3, with a Big-East
road trip to Boston College and
Providence looming on the
horizon this weekend.

In non-conference games,
the Panthers are 4-1, but they
are a dismal 0-2 in the Big
East.

It’s time to ignore those ﬂuffy
stats and look to the real work-

-men, the guys who eat up their

yardage on the ground. .

And in 1994, when you’re
looking for running back candi—
dates for the Heisman, you’re
looking at Napoleon Kaufman
of Washington and Ki-Jana
Carter of Penn State.

While McNair andhis Braves
were losing 48-23 to Sam
Houston State on Saturday,
Kaufman was grinding out 80
toughyards in the Orange Bowl
as his Huskies ended the Miami
Hurricanes’ 58—game, home

winning streak.

And Carter was once again the
catalyst of Penn State’s devastat-
ing offense, rushing for 122
yards and three TDs in leading
the Nittany Lions’ 55-27 pound-
ing of Rutgers.

Both players represent the
heart and soul, blood and guts of
their respective clubs.

Both are tough as hell, durable
football players, and either is
worthy of being referred to as
college football’s best player.

And both would look good
carrying the Heisman.

this year with many freshman

Most of these freshmen face
the challenge of rowing for the
first time in their lives and are

One group that seems to
have adjusted well is the men’s
freshmen eight boat, which
will be racing in the Club
Eight division on Saturday.

The fall schedule for the
Panthers is informal compared
to the spring, and they will be
racing in only four events
excluding Saturday.

The freshmen eight and the
heavyweight four boats from
last year placed into champi-
onship division races for
Saturday because of strong
wins and stand a good chance
of winning their respective

races.

“With teams’ like Brown,
Notre Dame and Penn racing,
we are really just looking to go
out and prove some things to
ourselves,” Dougherty said.
“We are just going to go out
there and have a fun race.”

The highlighted race for Pitt

ty eight.

respected Philadelphia Dad
