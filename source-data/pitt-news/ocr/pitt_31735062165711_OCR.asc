Students Offered Jobs Abroad

The American—European Stu-
dent Foundation is again offering
summer jobs overseas. There are
job opportunities in Germany,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, as
well as in Ireland, Switzerland,
England, France, Italy and Hol-
land.

The jobs are open to American
university students coming to
Europe in the summer of 1963.
They consist of forestry work,
child care‘ work (females only),
farm work, hotel work (limited
number available), construction
work, and some other more qual-
iﬁed jobs requiring more special-
ized training.

The purpose of this program is
to afford the student an opportun-

ityto get into real living contact‘

with the people and customs of
Europe. In return for his work,
the student will receive his room

and board, plus a wage.

Students, however, should keep
in mind that they will be working
on the European economy and
wages will naturally be scaled
according. Working conditions

will be strictly controlled by the
labor ministries of the countries
involved.

In most cases, the employers

have requested American stu-
dents.
For further information and

application forms students should
write to: American-European
Student Foundation, Placement

Service, Via Santorre Santarosa
23, Florence, Italy. ‘

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED

R. L. Signfoos was a. keen, :i.mbitious lad, and when he ﬁnished

_high school he wished mightily to go on with his education. It

seemed, however, a. forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. l..’s fat-her raised orchids which,
in North Dakot7:t, is a'form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still ﬁnd time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with ‘misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon 2}
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a l\'l:1rlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion-—happy or sad, pensive or exiibernnt, cheery or
solemn——when l\-'la.rlboro with its ﬁne ﬁlter and ﬁne flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we~t.he makers of
Marlboro and I and R. L. Signfoos——liope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a lylarlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?'!

    

.~..,

I we afar/zz'//5 /ewzif//efacrizczii/no//ezz

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. llis skin was almost ti'anspui'ci1t, showing a.
delicate trnccry of l'mgilc bones beneath. His back was bent,

and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.

R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw

wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,

sir,” said R. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?” I

“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with 9. rheumy
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself."

“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.

“Yes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
atvfive o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAE
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the school of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the (lamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif-
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve
I watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two I exercised the mice in psych lab. At three
I gave the l )ea.n of Women another fencing lesson. At four I
had qualitative analysis. At ﬁve I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies. At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes
in a gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and‘
at three I went to sleep.” ,

Facing Space  

The announcement that the University will be the site
of _a new $30 million Space Research Center feathers the

‘caps of the City, the State, and of course, Chancellor
I ..Litchﬁeld.

On top of such projects as presented by the Urban Re-

‘, newal Authority and OakCorp, the arrival of the space,

center will give Pittsburgh the greatest economic and spiri-
tual shot—in-the-arm that it has received since the discovery
of coal. Education, indeed, will become a major industry

‘here with such projected developments as this and the Uni-

versity Research Park. As there is no end to education, so
should there be no end to the expansion of Pi-ttsburgh’s
educational facilities, something which the City should

Pennsylvania should also be proud'that the Space

{Center will be constructed here. As Governor Lawrence
“ﬁstated last week, “This Space Center is of great importance

to . . . the Commonwealth. .This Center is sure to create
many opportunities for us to advance more rapidly into a
leading role in the space age.” The Governor added that
“This is a signiﬁcant addition to other space projects in
Pennsylvania and speaks well for the continuing coopera-
tion of institutional, industrial and governmental forces in"
the Commonwealth.”

And the Space Center is welcomed by the Chancellor
in that it is exactly the kind of development which he per-
sonally has advocated for the University for some time.
While speaking on the growth of the institutionduring the
past ﬁve years at the annual Fall Convocation last year, Dr.
Litchﬁeld affirmed that “It is perfectly apparent that what
we popularly refer to as the space age introduces extraor-
dinary opportunities and responsibilities for virtually every
discipline and professional ﬁeld represented on this or any
campus . . . I am in fact suggesting that we take space as a
problem, and that we organize our several faculties in order
that each may contribute and that the institution as a
whole may make a massive attack on the problem.”

The Chancellor also pointed out that bringing the space
"age to the University on a full-scale basis would increase
“the signiﬁcance of our individual efforts . . . its stature in
the academic world . . . and our’ contribution to our own
national welfare.” '

All of the implications of the Space Research Center
have not yet even been imagined, but it is not too early to
say, that it represents the most important if not the most
exciting and far-reaching happenings in recent years.

Medicare Problem

1:

One of the most important pieces of domestic
legislationjthat the new.Congress will consider this

‘year is President Kennedy’s plan for medical care

for the aged. Under the Administration plan,"medi-
cal expenses for. those people
over 65 will be ﬁnanced through
Social Security beneﬁts. For an
individual with a $5,000 salary,
the increases in his Social‘ Se"-.

ﬁve cents a day.

There can be no doubt about
the need for.1egislation.of‘some’
sort to deal with the problem of
medical care for the aged. This
problem has been intensiﬁed" in
modern times. Thanks to the _ _
splendid job doctors andiscientists have performed
and are still performing in the‘ ﬁeld of health,
people now live longer. Unfortunately, in our so-
ciety, when a man or woman reaches the age of‘65

 

or thereabouts, his .'productive'l‘abor is no longer-

wanted. What this means is thatlthere is a tre-

mendous income gap between the average Ameri'—.

can and the average aged American.
Musf Pay Jusf as‘Much .

As of 1960 there were 16 million Americans
over 65. Their. average income was $966. But the
aged person must pay just as im’uch as anyone else
for the products and services he purchases.’ Be-
cause he is sick more often and takes longer to
recover, the aged person incurs medical expenses
which are 90 percent higher thanjthose of the
average American. Thus, medical care for the aged
presents a unique problem because these people
have a terribly low income along with unusually
high _medical expenses.

College students have a deﬁnite interest in the
controversy over how to ﬁnance medical care ‘for

aged. Under the Kerr—Mills Bill. the means test

that elderly people are submitted to includes an
investigation of their childrens‘ assets-. If our par-
ents, when they reach the age of 65, are unfor-

tunate enough to need costly’ medical care that.

they won’t be able to afford, some state govern-
ments will require us, as well as our parents, to
take paupers’ oaths before they -will aid them.

A Label Fable

' Mills Bill.

3] Irv C-arfinkel

The Kerr—Mills Bill, enacted under the Eisen-
hower Administration, does not meet the problem
adequately. Under this plan, aid is financed jointly

-by the state and federal governments. But, most
I state governments have ﬁnancial problems and

therefore they have refused to implement the Kerr-
The poorer states, especially in the
South, whose citizens probably could beneﬁt most
from Medicare, will be the last to provide for it
under; the Kerr—Mills Bill. The Social Security
‘approach, on the other hand, will provide beneﬁts
for everyone "who is covered by Social Security.

A Opponents of the Kennedy plan for Medicare
claim that it constitutes socialized medicine. If
‘socialism means public ownership and ‘direction,
thenjsocialized medicine would entail government
nationalization of hospitals, clinics, and all health
centers, and n'ati,onalization of theih"ealt_h profes-
sion in addition. Yet, an examination of the Ad-
ministration bill will show, that there is no provi-
sionfor nationalization of anything. ' ’
Free'En1'erprise Nof Threatened

Free enterprise in the medical‘ profession_is not
threatened. The medical care for the aged plan is
an ‘extension of the Social Security principle. If
Social Security isn’t a- Socialist measure, then
neither is the Kennedy Medicare proposal. To
deﬁne Social ‘Security as socialism is to twist the
meaning of words. The labeling ofthe Administra-
tion proposal as socialized ‘medicine is nothing
more than a smear \campaign.

This smear campaign, by frightening Americans
with nasty words like Socialism and. Socialized
Medicine, has clouded the real issue. Under the
Kerr—Mills Bill, if it is implemented in every state,

. an elderly person in need. oflaid must submit to

a degrading means test. He must seek charity.
Under the Social Security plan, on the other hand,
individuals over 65 will have paid" for their medical
expenses during the years when they worked and

‘could afford the payments. Social Security is based _

on the principle of insurance. Thus, medical care
for the aged, ﬁnanced through Social Security, not
only is more practicalthan the present system im-
plemented under the Kerr—Mills Bill, but it also is
better morally. The main issue is insurance Versus
‘charity.

The Sign Line     

Considering my long-established aﬁinity for,

cigarettes,'it did not seem at allsurprising when I
started to ‘mjumble ominous‘ sounds ‘after I ﬁnished
readingin a recent copy, of The Pitt News ‘about
an attempt/to scare the student
population out of smoking" by-
puttinga verbal skull and cross— ,
‘bones on‘ the University’s ciga- 7
rette machines. But contrary" to 
what some people may think 
would be a smoker’s reaction to .
"an attack on smoking,VI do not if: j
object to some, well-meaning’
.person’s desire to warn of the
possible dangers of .cigarettes.

   

some injustice in the University’s ' .
policy concerning the use of signs and labels. ‘/

Is seems to me that, instead of placing what ‘a,{;- ,. .

pears to be a rather absurdlittle sign on the vend-
ing machines, it would be far more appropriate and
beneﬁcial to the masses of‘ students to have the
sign—and-label-makers employed elsewhere within
the University. ’ ‘

Certainly it is comforting to be able to think
that someone in the higher echelons cares about
the physical welfare of the students, but it is not
so soothing to be quite certain that considerable
frustration and anxiety might be alleviated by a
few signs or labels in other places. Many other
places.

Direcfions Not Wrong

For instance, some unoriented students might
beneﬁt from more signs saying Salk Hall rather
than Municipal Hospital so that if, like me, one
approaches the building from the far side, it is not
necessary to suppose that the woman in the infor-
mation ofﬁce gave the wrong directions.

And there are a number of library users and
evening students who would ﬁnd it advantageous
if someonewould put a sign on the doors to the
Tuck Shop, stating the hours when the Tuck Shop
and Hiint R_oom»are open. Again, I -know from ex-
Perisnce .tha.§t some .Pel°I21<:1..d9!1’.t« .1<.r.w.¥!.»~ .

WILLIFRED MELLORS
Andrew Mellon Professor

By CHUCK LOCH

Grey-haired Professor Wilifrid
Mellers, Andrew Mellon Profes-
sor of Music, delivered his lec-
ture “Revelation and Incarnation:
The end of a European Tradition”
in a very delightful British ac-
cent to an audience of approxi-
mately 50 people in Stephen Fos-

ter Memorial Hall last Wednes-

day evening.

“There is a crisis in modern
music, the same as in modern civ-
ilization,” Professor Mellers stat-
ed. “This crisis is not common
only to the 20th century; there
were similar ones in both the 14th
and 17th centuries.”

“How des today’s crisis relate
to past crisis?” was a question
presented by Professor Mellers.
He explained that past renassance
art was concerned mostly with
European behavior, but there was
also the eastern conception of mu-
sic.

“This conception is not like any-
thing we are familiar with mu-
sically,” he said. “It is in sound
more like that of primitive ori-
ental music. The eastern musician
plays not to show his own feelings
in the piece.”

In This Type
In this type of music the com-

Aposer’s beauty reveals the inner

feelings of man, according to Dr.
Mellers. “Al1 oriental music is
then revelation. The composer
seeks a separation from the life
of today to some godly life.”
Professor Mellers also stated
that Christian music was the
first to have spoken wordsvwith
it. This music, called troubador
music, can have traced back to
oriental,mus_ic, but has a sim-
pler verse pattern. ‘

Its instruments were used

A merely to amplify the total sound

of this music. “Then, one day by
accident a troubador sang at the
same pitch as his instrument and

  

discovered it sounded better. To-
day’s music came as a result of
this harmony of voices and in-
strument,” Professor Mellers
stated.
Another Accident

Another accident also helped
the development of music. Mid-
dle Age music occurred mostly in
the church. According to Profes-
sor Mellers, this music became
monotonous, making people hate
music. At some unknown time
during this period a pipeplayer
discovered the pleasant sound
produced by the sounding of two
pipes at different pitches.

“This gave rise to real har-
mony. Previously when people
sang off pitch it sounded terri-
ble. ~ Now people could sing at
different pitches and the quality

of the sound would be im-
proved.
“Renaissance music is based

upon this harmony which helped
to change it from something with
only church meaning to something
with a social meaning as well,”
he continued.

“In the very late renaissance
came the sense of beat or musical
tone. This discovery was corre-
lated with the invention of the
clock.

“Also at this time music turned
to representing human suﬁering
and passion. Milton had written
that man in his power over na-
ture had taken God’s place in
life. Thus, man becomes incar-
nate.”

In the 17th century, however,
people gave up the idea that man
had replaced God. During this
century Beethoven gave music in-
dividuality. Hsi works brought a
revival in the ﬁeld. Meller said,
“Music is the only way to a higher
level of learning. Art represents
the divine and music is art. Thus
man’s relationship to music is like
a relation to God.” Music is art:
so ends a European tradition.

“You have more to do since
structure is changing from a
Saturday night dance to a week-
end affair. If you start now you
can take advantage of the ex-
perience of the seniors involved
in it this year.”

Sherman advised that SG con-
tract a place off campus rather
than use the Commons Room for
the Saturday night dance. He also
proposed that it be an all Uni-
versity event. “This would-mean
the co-operation, the inﬂuence,

“The lack’ of these this year was
the committee’s biggest com-
plaint,”
“There was also great confusion
at this end because there were too

“It’s a step in the right direc-
tion to have Homecoming as a

mented. “With the application
of this analysis in changes for

of judges, one Greek and one in-
dependent, will make the ﬁnal de-
cision. The trophies will be
awarded at the ﬁnal home game.

In Europe

Martin Landy, a political
science major, will study the “In-
ﬂuence of the United States on
German Policy” in Germany this
summer as a participant in the‘
fourth European Summer Re-
search Program.

He is one of seventeen juniors
selected for the program, spon-
sored by Princeton University
with the aid of a grant from the
Corporation of New
York.

An advisory committee of the

participating institutions selected 
the students on the basis of their 
outstanding academic r e c o r d s, ‘
their ability to carry out indepen-

dent research, and the promise to
carry out the project proposals.
The students» will receive grants

, or the expenses of the summer to

do research ‘in the area of the im-
pact of the non-"European world
on Western Europe.

In preparation for this program,
the students will begin the back-
ground study of the general topic
and their individual projects dur-
ing this term.

The group. will spend two
weeks at the Institute for Social
Studies in the Hague exploring

the ways in which the non-Euro-

pean world‘ inﬂuenced and shaped
Western European societies. Then

the members will do individual .

research in various European

‘cities. Some of them willlive with

host families under the Experi-
_‘ment in International Living Pro-

. gram.

   

»'cently' ‘exhibited in

The-group will meet again for
two weeks in August to discuss
their ﬁndings. Finally, the stu-
dents will "incorporate their re-
sults into senior theses or honors

.-essays.

Another University student,
John T. McKechnie,‘ participated
in this: program last summer.

we can do in our defense is to

reports which point this out.”
‘ Very Funny

A. J. Walker, another area cig-
arette company representative, re-
marked that on a trip to the Uni-
versity last week, he found that

“the students feel it’s all a big
laugh.”

Jllovvever, he observed, if “this
thing IS. allowed to, it could get
011* Of 11€l~11d,” and the vending
machine companies are the only
ones which “can control
Thompson.”

By this hereferred to the pro-
vision that no signs can be posted
on vending machines without the
consent of the company which op-
erates those machines.

No Action Taken
However, Walker surmised, “the
Vending In a c h i n e companies
aren’t going to take any action,
because of the possible loss of lo-

that the University can refuse to
allow the cigarette machines on
campus at all, and since college-
placed machines bring in more
than seven times the revenue that
‘ordinary machines do, it would
be foolish for the companies to
"risk losing this business.
What Speicher feels will hap-
pen is that cigarette sales on
"campus will drop but will then
pick up again within a month.
“We went through this same
 thing five years ago. . Sales
‘dropped fora ‘few weeks but
within another week had re-

 

 

cation.” This means, he explained,-

turned to normal and by the end

creased.” ‘ '
Suggests Another Approach

“Dr. Thompson would be smart
if he tried another ﬁeld of ap-
proach. The various poisons used
on fruit and vegetables and the
products used for the fattening
of cattle might also have some-
thing to do with cancer.”

Speicher could also not see
“the logic of the stand which
he (Thompson) has taken re-
garding advertising.” What good
can these signs do, he explained,
when The Pitl:-News continues
to advertise cigarettes in the pa-
per each week.

Thompson, however, said in a
story which appeared in The
Piﬁsbllrgh Post-Gazette last
Thursday that he has “urged The
Pitt News to reject cigarette ad-
vertising.” _ '

Never Conferred

nElliot Drexler, business mana-
ger of The Pitt News stated how-
ever that “Dr. Thompson has
never directly conferred with me
on the subject of removing cig-
arette advertising from the paper.

“He may have some good
points,” concealed Drexler, “but
he is certainly going about it in
the wrong way and we will ig-
nore any such underhanded at-
tempts to force us to drop cig-
arette advertising.” ’

Dr. Thompson recently stated
that he has had “no adverse crit-
icism from any faculty member
on my campaign."

An image of the Cathedral
against the background of the
globe symbolizes, the internation-
al spirit of Quo Vadis, a volun-

, tary student organization of Na-

tionality Room hostesses. Quo
Vadis, Latin for “whither goest
thou,” has been in existence for
some 20 years.

Since many visitors ‘used to
wander into the Nationality
Rooms and disturb classes, four
students were hired to conduct
tours, according to Christine Tay-
ilor, Quo Vadis advisor since 1961.

Increased student interest in
learning about the rooms and an
eagerness to help the University
led womens’ service groups to
meet ‘with Helen P. Rush, dean of
students. They organized a train-
ing program for women who
‘wished to volunteer their services
as -hostesses, Miss Taylor ex-
plained.

Born in '45

Then, in 1945, Quo Vadis was
initiated as an honorary, admitting
hostesses who fulfilled a Q.P.A.
requirement and devoted a cer-
taininumber of hours to hostess-
ins.

Since hostesses who were not
Quo Vadis members did not
have the opportunity to partici-
pate in its activities, which‘
were designed to make the
women better hostesses, the re-
quirements were dropped. Now
all women who participate in
the training program and pass
the test required of hostesses
«may become-,members of Quo
Vadis.

Serving as guides at least two
hours a week, the hostesses, some
30 in number, offer tours -'frr.nn
10 a.m., to 4 p.m, on weekdays
and from 1 pm. to 4 p.m. on Sat-
urdays. They also conduct tours
through Heinz Chapel and hostess
for special University events.

I-lcld A Dinner

As a _part of their international-
ly-oriented activities, Quo Vadis
members held a dinner and an in-
formal talk with a daughter of
Thomas G. lvlasaryk, the first
president of C‘//cchoslovakia.

Later this month they are going
to celebrate the Chinese New
Year by going to“a restaurant and
temple in Chinatown with a mem-
ber of the Chinese room commit.-

Distinguished speakers such
as Mrs. Ruth Crawford M_itchell,
former Nationality Room pro-

;gram director who has also
worked for the League of Na-
tions and the "United Nations,
often speak to the group.

Comeback Of

Carr Cains Only IV in;
Mike Johnson Tied

By BOB Sl\IIZlI{

SYRACUSE —— “It’s gonna
be a long Monday,” moaned it
one wrestler after the Pitt-.

Syracuse match Saturday.

The wrestler hadno reason

to complain. Coach Rex Perry

has every right -to schedule-a-
Jgruelling workout for his team -
in light of the humiliating beat- A

ing they suffered here, 24-7.

tory for Pitt.

,Johnson’s match was typical of 
all Panther effects during the at'— '
ternoon. Tied 2-2 going into the ,

ﬁnal period, Johnson escaped to
take the lead and- looked on’ his
wa‘y to victory. Greenhalgh, how-
ever, got hold of Johnson’s leg‘
just as Iowa State’s Lowell had
done. Johnson was not able ‘to
defend ‘himself this time, how-
ever. -
See-Saw Affair‘
Although he briefly gave hope
of breaking 'Grenhalg‘h’s hold,
such w as not the case and the
Syracuse wrestler got "his take-
down. Johnson escaped to tie
the match- ’ ,
Take-downs in the last "per-
iod were the downfall of the
Panthers. Every Panther wrest-
ler except Carr and Jeff'Ware

had two - point take -‘downs
scored against them ._ in the
third period. Saturday they

had seven- in" nine matches.

Westminster Defeated, 61-51

By ART FLEISCHNER ‘
Will success spoil Coach Bob Timmons? After his team
had just defeated Geneva 80-60, Timmons complained about

his squad being too hot.

Timmons was referring to the atmosphere of the Field
House and not the shootingof his team. He should have been

referring to the team, however, for they shot a fine 45 percent. '

Gymnasts Face

s Springfield « On

Road Tonight

By AL BLUMKIN
The gymnastic team will
try to shake off the effects of

i »a debut defeat at Syracuse

last Saturday night when
they vie for their first victory
of the season tonight at
Springﬁeld College in Massach-
usetts.

The Panthers bowed to Syra-
cuse, 57%, to 38‘/3, on the first stop
of their extended weekend tour,
as the Orange advanced their re-
cord to 3-0.

Syracuse scored ﬁrst places in
ﬁve of the six events, topped by
Ray Grimaldi and Phil Voas who
were double-winners. The versa-
tile Voas won the floor exercises
and horizontal bar and Grimaldi
took ﬁrsts in the still rings and
side horse. Steeves captured the
long horse title.

Anti-Trust Man

The only Panther to crack this
monopoly was team captain Ed
Zamecnik who scored a victory in
the parallel bars. ‘

Zamecnik accounted for 13‘/_»
points, also scoring seconds in
the still rings and horizontal
bar. Jack Lehner was the only
other Panther to even score a
second, ﬁnishing second to
Steeves in the long horse.

Several men turned in disap-
pointing performances for the
Panthers. Roland James, who
scored several victories in the side
horse last year, placed no better
than fourth this time. Bob Pinga—

, tore finished a poor third in his

long horseitpecialty.

The meet ‘was decided in the
floor. exercise event where the
Orangemen swept. the ﬁrst three
places. Coach Warren Neiger’s
fears of weakness in this even
were proven » justifiable.

half-time, 36-20, but only out’-
scored Geneva 44-40 in the sec-

ond half as players were ‘con-‘

tent to sit on their lead.

Covies Comeback _

When Coach Timmons. gave
Brian Genera1ovich~a rest midway
in the second half, ‘
roared to within ten points, 53-43
That was as close as they
came. Cal Sheﬂield, who had 14
points for the night, ‘although

he still didn’t work, the ball‘

against the Geneva zone, hit a
three point play and Geneva.
never came closer than 13
points. V

'Generalovi_ch led Panther scor.
ers with 18 points, while Paul
Krieger and Dave Roman had 13,
and Ben Jinks had 117 The statis.
tie that pleased Coach Timmons
the most, however, was" the 20
rebounds by Krieger. This was
only four less than the record
held by assistant freshman coach
John Fridley. . .

Show Class

This past Wednesday night at
New Wilmington, the Panthers
d e 1"; e a t e d Westminster, ‘6l-51.
Playing before an overflow crowd,
the team showed their class. They
refused to rattle when they fell
behind in the ﬁrst half, and it
seemed as if all the fouls were
called against them.

The Titans Look a 26-25 half-
time lead to the dressing room,
thanks mainly to Warren Sal-
lade’s 19 points. But in the sec-
ond half,~the Panthers, who had
trouble with the Vvestminster
zon: in the ﬁrst half, moved the
-ball better and the offense be-
gan to look respectable,

Warren Sallade took scoring
honors with 29 points, but the
Panthers more diversiﬁed attack
proved better in the long run.
Three players hit double ﬁgures.
Jinks led with 16, the General was
next with 14, and Roman added
13.

SUNDAY —— Day of rest. This humble reporter spent the
whole day trying to reason why the school administration
_ condones — no, encourages, — the sale of tickets to the Pitts-
“burgh Hornet hockey games at reduced rates on the same

There have been three date conflicts already- and the

the menu in other restaurants we have visited. The same
dish in other cities: $3.10 at the Golden Lion in Seattle; $2.75
at_the Hotel Chamberlin in Fort Monroe; $3.25 at the Playboy
, -Club in Miami, $1.10 at the Penn State Diner in University
 ' Park. Started reading “The Silent Spring” by Rachel Carson
last night. It seems better than Jim Brosnan’s “The Long
Season” already. _  '
WEDNESDAY — Sold three subscriptions to Play-

Lilliputian Defies Laws;’

Starts for Cub Cagers

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Someone said there was a freshman basketball player
here who was only 5-feet 2—inches in height.
When a reporter asked Coach Carl Peterson if this were

true, Peterson exclaimed, “He’s not 5-2! I wouldn’t even con-_; -1

sider a man 5-2 ‘for a high school junior varsity, let alone a
college freshman basketball team. He’s 5-3.”

‘ Peterson was talking about Ted:

Lazzaro,-- a basketball dwarf, who
hails from Bloomﬁeld Highischool
in New Jersey where he averaged
about ' ten ‘points. ‘
Unbalanced Shooter
“Teddy can°t shootunless he's

iwide open,” says John Fridley, a
player here in 1958-61, who aids I

Peterson. I-“He must adjust his
shooting. He’ll have to develop‘

an off-balance shot, like a fall‘-"

away jump shot.

“He has tremendous legs,”
Fridley added, “which give him
‘terriﬁc spring. But even at that,
it makes him astall as a man
5-9. And he’ll face very few
men of that height.” . A

Despite his short shortcomings,

Lazzaro .is the leader of the Cubs,
according to Fridley. ‘‘He’s a real
hustler,” he said. “He gives the
team a lift when they show up
because he never quits.”

-Iv‘

That's, quite _a load to carry ,4‘

/' .

when you’re only 5-2..

“He makes up for his deﬁ-
ciency by his many steals,” said
Coach Peterson.

- Still, ‘his chances of playing
varsity are slim. “It vy'on’t even
pay for him to tryout,” concluded
Fridley. “Don Hennon was her-
alded, as a great little man and

,he’s.six inces taller than Teddy.”

Rich Rush, one of t.he two
swimming team c0—captains, per-
formed valiantly in the 400-yard
medley relay and the 200-yard
breaststroke events in the Prince-
ton m e e t- al-
t h o u g h - the
t e a m ﬁnished
last in the for-
mer event, and
a 1 t h 0 u g h he
himself 0 n l y
placed third in
the latter.

R u s h i was
In or V e d to
breaststroke
just recently to
try to_ offset the i "
losses of two Rich Rush
breaststrokers due to scholastic
difficulties. , .

He had previously lettered for

  

. two years as a free styler and had
‘been a member of the 1961 400-

yard free style relay team which
had held the University record in
that _event up to the Princeton
meet last Saturday.

Moving around in athletics is
not new to Rush. At Langley High
School, he played the part of a
“journeyman athlete,” m o v i n g
from cross-country to football to
basketball, and, ﬁnally, to swim-
ming. _

Rush began swimming for the

Oakland YMHA in tenth grade
: and found it a good ‘conditioner
for the summer months.

He did well enough in high
school swimming to warrant his
election as captain for two years,
and, in his ﬁnal year, he took
ﬁrsts in the 200—yard free style
and 150-yard individual medley

3 - for the individual city champion-

ships.

During his senior year, he
‘was also the recipient of the
’Optimists’ Club sportmanship
award for a Langley athlete.

Now, proving his mettle as a
co-captain, he is swimming where
he is needed most, possibly, but
not necessarily, ‘ where he does
best.

SIVIIZIK

Iowa State, the nation’s third-ranked wrestling team;

ran into the Panther wrestling

squad at the wrong time last.

Wednesday and was the victim of a 15-9 upset.

The sophomore—loaded wrestlers learned" their lessons‘

well while losing to Michigan,

and were not about to make

the same mistakes against the Cyclones.

Sophomore Lee Hall had" the big‘

win for the grapplers when he

defeated Jim Glover, 5-2 in the
177-pound match to give Pitt a
12-9 lead. Hall, who looked out
of shape against Michigan, but
wasn’t, spent his energy wisely
against Glover and scored an es-
cape with 90 seconds remaining
and a take-down a minute later
to win the match. \
Goat. Clinches

It was ~ Ken Barr, the goat
against Michigan, who clinched
the match for the Panthers. Barr
completely dominated the Big
Eight’s number three heavyweight
Bill Abbas, to score an easy 6-1
win.

Barr rode Abbas for close to
seven m_inutes to give some idea
of the easy time he had 'against
his heavier foe.

Mike Johnson, Tom Baily and
Jim Harrison had the Panthers
other wins. Johnson had a sur-
prisingly tough time with Lowell
Stewart before winning, 4-1.

Baily Exciting

Baily wrestled the most excit-
ingmatch of the evening, against
Larry Bewley. The match was
tied 4-4 with 30 seconds remain-
ing, but Bewley had riding time.
Baily reversed Bewley at this
point—and they rode him out for
the remaining half-minute like
Stoney Burke would -handle a
bucking bronco.

Harrison was his usual -pre-

cisioned self in manhandling

Larry Hochhaus, 5-0. .He_had '

over six minutes riding time.

The Panthers’ losers had” noth-
ing to be ashamed of either. John
Carr and Frank O’Korn lost to the

Cyclones’ two best wrestlers,’Vir- S in

gil Carr and Veryl Long.

Tom Heniif had the misfortune
to fall behind in the first period
and then had to try and score
against Roger Sebert,
content to lay on his stomach. A

John Carr’s _

make him a Field House favorite.

He had Virgil C‘arr in quite a ’ 
bit of trouble early in the match ‘.

but couldn’t put him away.
If the wrestlers can continue
their improvement they will be a

tough outfit to beat during the .

remainder of the season.

It can cost everything you have,‘or nothing. But chances are pretty good
that when you sign your name, it's often on a check, and probably costs
you at least a dime. Figure the number of checks youwrlte, multiply by.

' free personal checking account. _Just maintain a $200 balance and all
your personal checks are completely free. No service charge. No mainte-
