1 1.938 Owl, University

Visit To Campus Today
By SIDNEY SHORE

ldella Rollie, C38, was sur-
prise speaker at the Tap l)ay
ceremonies this morning. Edi-
tor Rome presented the first
copy of the 1938 "Owl to E.
Ernest Rose, Jr., C38, president of
SFA.

Rose received the book on be-
half of the students he represents,
to whom the yearbook was dedi-
cated. Additional copies went to
those seniors named to the Owl
Hall of Fame. This is the first
time The Owl has appeared on
campus in time for Spring Festi-
val Week.

 
 

The 350-page volume is bound
in wine and silver leather with an
unusual photographic insert on the
«cover. Accenting the informal
side of college, the book contains
.:-1 complete record of student life.

Departing from the staid tradi-
tion of formal group pictures and
trite biographies, the staff this
year has attempted to portray the
true spirit of a University through
a series of candid camera snaps,
photomontage studies, outdoor
group pictures, and short sketches.

Books will be distributed to the
general student body on Monday.
Recepits may be turned in at the
Owl ofﬁce in_ 801 Cathedral.

The Owl---
Debut And Credit

Appearing on campus today is the single
tangible result of a year’s work by 40‘ students
who work across the way from our ofﬁces. As
fellow members of the fourth estate, We oﬁer
them our congratulations.

The Owl, which has a liinit'ed circulation and
which is issued but once a year, is released to-
day. The bound volume is a considerable en-
terprise for a staff of college students.

The staff and the editor deserve credit for a
job well done.

The Signiﬁcance
Of Having Done

’\‘Fc are determined not to be cynical today.
Tap Day ceremonies this morning were pro-
vided, traditionalized, and maintained for the
purpose of honoring ‘those students at the Uni-
versity who have done meritorious work.

Among today’s tappees are those students
who surely deserve their recognition‘; they
have labored diligently, they have’ given up
free time to participate in the Welter of extra-
curricular activities. / _

As activities at the University go-—and they
go in abundance and profusion--these people
who are honored are leaders. The honor itself,
we believe, is just‘ as signiﬁcant as the work
of the individual honored.

There is much talk about unfair practices.
There is much after-Tap Day complaining
about the disposition of awards. There is talk

VVe oﬁer our congratulations to those who
deserve them. The point of reference is clear.

What I-—i...g. Om

By Clarence Wible

The other day one of the members of the faculty
insinuated that if it were not for the compulsory
class attendance the first two hours of Friday, a
very small minority of the student body would at-
tend the day’s Spring Festival activities. I am in-
clined to concur in this professor’s opinion. The
Pitt Spring Festival is, at best, a pretty thin affair.

There is a lack of enthusiasm for the events of
this Festival Weeli that is amazing. In smaller col-
leges where the funds for similar celebrations are
very limited, the attitude of the student body to-
wards the Spring celebration is one of whole-
hearted approvial. Across the hollow on the Tech
campus, theregis enough student enthusiasm to
bring Tommy Dorsey and George Hall to the cam-
pus for the wind-up social event of their Festival
Week. Pitt indiiferently dances to Skip
and Howard Baum.

Tom Dorsey At Tech

One cannot blame this lackadaisical attitude to-
wards the Festival events entirely on a disinter-
ested student body. The general handling of the
entire celebration could certainly be bettered. The
Pitt Festival, in contrast with the celebration across
the hollow, lacks the unity and cohesion that pro-
motes the sincere and concerted support on the part
of the student body as a whole that is necessary for
the success of any such endeavor. The events are
too widely scattered, separate tickets must be
bought for each event. Why not inaugurate the
policy of a blanket ticket for all events? Tech ﬁnds
it highly desirable to charge a blanket fee of $5 a
couple for their four nights of fun, even including
the Tommy Dorsey, George Hall‘ affair the last
night. True, there is probably very little proﬁt;
but, after all, must there be a proﬁt?

Houston

Fraternity Domination

And, lastly, Pitt’s Spring Festival can never be
a success until it alienates itself from the domina-
tion of one powerful group—that is, to speak
frankly, the fraternity group. It is foolish to -deny
that the Festival is not controlled by the fraternity
cial fraternities. If such a policy is to be continued
inxthe future as it has in the past, let’s forgetall
this malarkey about Pitt’s Spring Festival Week,
and, by calling a spade a spade, designate this week
as Fraternity Celebration Week. Then all those be-
yond the pale could week-end it at home ,with a
clear conscience. i '

been approved by the university’s board of trustees.

The new program will extend the period of train-
ing from four to ﬁve years and greatly increase the

emphasis on “background” studies in the social
sciences. The ﬁrst three years will be spent in gen-
eral foundation courses; the last two, in more “spe-
cialized” courses in the school of journalism.

English Student Likes
Fraternal ‘Bug Houses’

Anthony Cartwright
‘Very Much Different

By Rugy

Declares University
’ From King’s College
Aldisert ’

“The University is not as strict as English colleges, but I

guess you can learn as much.”

So says British subject Anthony Cartwright‘, enrolled as a
special student in the School of Engineering. .The 18-year-old

prospective industrial engineer,

is the son of the man who

helped design the stained glass windows now being installed in

the Heinz Chapel. His father

is employed by the Connick

Studios in Boston where Cart-¢
wright lived previous to his com-
ing to school.

Now staying at the Sigma Chi
fraternity house, the blonde-head-
ed, witty ‘.‘Tony” was formerly a
student at King’s college, at Kent,
England. “King’s,” he accents, “is
very much different from the Uni-
versity. There, the , uniformed
male student body is required to
keep within the school bounds at
all times, are n.ot allowed to go
into the town without special per-
mission, and meet with girls only
at school socials. Women are
found only at the large universi-
ties, such as Cambridge and Ox-
ford where they do not have
mixed classes.”

“BUG HOUSE”

He had never seen a fraternity
house before coming here and de-
scribes one as “something of a bug
house but it’s fun.” Tony reports
that British collegians are housed
i.n three types of buildings. Na-
tive Englishmen live in the
“Home House;’’ ‘colonial subjects
reside in “Colonial I-Iouse;” United
States citizen-students make their
quarters in the “Yank House.”

“Lacking American fraternity
rivalry, England sees only the con-
flict between the “houses.” Most

‘Three

 

open is the “japing” carried on
between “Home” and “Colonial.”
Particularly strong is the open
strife between native Britians and
the “Aussies,” or “brushbeaters”
from Australia. Yanks,” he says,
“talk their way into the good
graces of everzrone.”

FAG SYSTEIVI

Another custom not seen here
at the University is the “fag” sys-
tem in England where all young
students have to go through a'pe—
riod of training similar to that of
fraternity Pledgeship, Tony adds.
How would you like to see all the
sophomores and freshmen at this
University continuously ordered
around by their superiors?” he
queries.

The most striking difference be-
tween the English college student
and the Pitt student is‘ that the
British are much more militaristic,
Cartwright admits. “Taking my

example you would see that I am

a registered reserve oﬁicer in the
Royal Flying Corps. 11 the big
universities back home have their
own airports. Training is similar
to your ROTC, only supported and
respected better.”

Clings To Superstitions

By DOROTHY CLELAND

Holding her maid’s gold. ring,
to her eye, Kitty Carlisle, "radio,
stage and screen star, alternately
answered _questions and hummed
snatches of songs while we inter-
viewed her in her dressing room,
back stage at the Nixon where
the “Three li5laltzes” is ‘playing.

While she applied this treat-
ment to what she thought might
be «a sty, Miss Carlisle confessed
to having pet superstitions that
ruleher stage life. Naturally she
will not permit anyone to whistle
in her dressing room and she al-
ways knocks on woodif anyone
wishes her good luck before a per-
formance.

LIKES NEW YORK .

And strangezy enough, although
she has appeared in numerous
musical plays on the stage, screen,
and radio, she has never lost her
fright. The zero hour is still a
signal for nervousness.

Also the ﬁrst day of “takes” in
the making of a ﬁlm is always the
worst, said Miss Carlisle. The di-
rector is nervous and subsequent-
ly everyone else, particularly

Panthers Meet Three
Big Ten Track Teams

By BILL MAZEFSKY

A squad of nineteen Panther
trackmen will heed Horace
Greeley ’s time-worn a d v i c e
about heading ‘West and spend
tomorrow in Northwest’ern’s
stadium at Evanston, Illinois,
together with the track squads
of Northwestern Purdue, and
Minnesota in a Quadrangular meet
that should find the well—traveled
Olsonmen on the long end of the
ﬁnal score.

This will be the third outdoor
session for the Pitt cindermen.
West Virginia first felt the sting
of the Pitt team, and fell an easy
victim. Then the Pitt team spent
a couple of busy afternoons at the
Penn Relays and clattered off with
three relay titles. Those after-
noons in Quakertown jockeyed
these speedy Pitt relay runners
into the national spozlight and the
press “re-discovered” striding
Johnny W ood1'L1f‘f.

IVCQDRUFF LIFTED

Olson, too, may do a little jock-
eying this Saturday. Johnny
Woodruff may be temporarily lift-
ed from his anchor spot on the
mile relay team so that he may be
better able to concentrate on the
880 and mile run. And unless the
outcome of the meet hinges on the
mile relay, Woodruff will not be
used in this event.

I-lowever, Franl: Ohl, Al Ferraro,
and Al lVicKee will be arounc., and
Ben Kopec will trot the quarter
mile lee‘ in place of Johnny. Kopec
is a handy quar‘;er-miler and the
relay team will be able to keep up

the unbro-l;en string of victories.-

McKee will replace Woodruif in
the anchor slot.

Kenny Ryden, who has been out
of competition since mid-winter,
will again take" his place on the
starting line of the high and low‘
hurdles. Ryden will skim hurdles
with Lemen of Purdue, one of
the best hurdlers in the country.
Hubbard of Minnesota will be
around to complicate the broad
jump situation.‘ .I-lubbard won the
broad jump at the Drake Relays

last ,week-end, ‘and _will be the’

man to outjump in this event.
Frank Ohl, Ed Routch, and Frank
Kristl will be at the broad jump
for Pitt.
POINTS IN SPRINTS

Most Panther pointage will be
piled up in the sprints, and middle
distances. . Captain Edgar ‘Mason,
Ohl and Routch will swing the 100
and 220-yard dash to the Pitt

A team. McKee Ferrara, and the

versatile Ohl will break tape in
the quarter mile. Woodruff will
trot off with the half-mile and
probably mile run.  '

sky will run the two mile and
mile run. Pole vaulting duties
fall to George Clifton and Ed

Johnny Bazyk will head the list
of ﬁeld men in the shot put and

Mr. George Crum-

Mr. Cecil White,

the Camel people. And at the best
prices. I stick to Camels and I know

Ferde Grofe’s “Mardi G-ra
the Mississippi State; the “Juba
Dance,” by Nathaniel Dett; and
Rube Bloom’s, “Song of the Ba-
you.” The University songs were
as popular as usual.

It is interesting and instruc-
tive to note how the musicians
went about their business of giv-
ing the Ameri-::-an music listed
above good, exciting readings.
Many of  players in the band
play in campus or off-campus or-
chestras. The heavily syncopat-
ed, swingy rhythms of this music
were. so to speak, right up the
bandmen’s alley, and under Mr.
Finney’s solid conducting, they
made the music alive and vital.

Also good were the two num-
‘)€l‘S, Tarantella,” by Holmes, and
the “March of the Steel Men,” by
Besterling. The two selections
featured the woodwind and brass
sections, respectively. As a
downtown music critic would put
it, the players “mounted Olym-
pian heights and projected them-
selves with ﬁne mettle.”

 

For once, the aiidience was a good critic,
most heal‘-‘.il,\' for the numbers it know best.

THE PITT NEWS

it applamled
These included

179 . - Q
S, .Oﬂ’lv

In contract, Weinberger’s “Pol-
ka and Fugue,” was slightly man-
handled. It was not really the
band’s fault. The parts If this
piece are ﬁlled with difl"icult tech-
nical passage that tax a symphony
player’s ﬁngers. To get 20 clari-
nets to play in unison on fast run-
ning passages is a real job, and
this accounts for the ragged edges
evident in the fugue.

There are a few other things
to be noted. Good marches, well
played, are good music, and the
band proved this. Dick Haughton,
trombone soloist, showed that he
can ﬁll the hole made by John
Shirley’s graduation; in fact the
whole trombone section is better,
with the absence of the “blatting”
so annoying in past year.

The band," under Mr. Finney, is
playing much more intelligently
with attention to forte and pian-
nisimo effects, and the general
opinion was that the band justi-
fied the cover blurb stating that
“it has won much credit for the
TTniversity.”
