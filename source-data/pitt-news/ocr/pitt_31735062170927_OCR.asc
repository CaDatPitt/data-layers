Kelly Assumes Duties As Dean Of The School Of Education

New Dean Excited by Chal

by LOIS ELDER

As the newly appointed Dean
of the School of Education. Dr.
James Kelly. Jr.. is interested in
an analysis of the functions of the
school. A V -

Kelly maintains that,he is a
"firm believer in getting input
from all constituencies related

with the School of Education. in— —

eluding’ faculty. students. and

alumni."

“I’m now in the process of in-
teracting with these‘ groups to get
feedback on expectations and an

assessment of how well we’re do-*

ing what we say. we’re doing,”

Kelly continued.
Although the school has a num-

ber of programs and activities. _

Kelly feels it is important to get
“a wide systematic feedback-" in
determining the usefulness of the
resources and efforts related to
policy formation. program refine-

. ment. allocation of resources. and

rewards and compensation.

Kelly says he is not one to sug-
gest that education may be held
responsible for all of society's ills.
but he does "believe that educa-
tional institutions have pro_found
influence on the eventual status
of persons who pass through these

institutions." .
This view is also held by the
National Commission ‘on Multi-
cultural Education of which Kelly
was chairman from 1970 to 1972. .
‘According to a Multicultural
statement. this type of education
“affirms that schools should be
oriented toward the cultural en-
richment of all children and
youth. through programs rooted
to the preservation and extension
of cultural alternatives.

statement continues. "recognizes

cultural diversity as a fact of life‘

LectureSeries Highlights Education

by MONICA A. CIROCCO I

The economic and [political as-
pects of education were the topics
covered in the third lecture series
of Encounter III. sponsored bv the
graduating class of the School of
Education on March 10.

I "Inequality: A Reassessment of
the Effect of Family and School-
ing in America.” a two-part lec-
ture by Herbert Gintis and Steph-

an Michelson. ‘contained the re-‘

sults of a three—year study that
the "speakers conducted with
Christopher Jencks.

Gintis, from the Harvard Uni-,

versity Center for Educational
Policy Research, began the lee-
ture by pointing out that both he
and Michelson were economists
who studied the relationship be-
tween‘/the educational system and
the economy. Through" his re-
search, he stated that he found

the standard philosophy of edu-_

cation in America “complete
trash,” with notable exceptions-
one is John Dewey's philosophy,
which Gintis sees as a good, al-
though not realistic, argument.

Dewey. in Democracy in Educa-
tion, saw schools as serving” three

functions: first. the promotion of ’

individual development: second.
the advancement of social repro-
duction of lifetand third. the ma-
jor mechanism for reducing in-
equalities in life. Dewey argued
that only in a democratic society
could these three functions coin-
cide. '

Giiitis stated: "The major fault
in ljeweyfs argument is the fact
that he characterizes our society
as "democratic." but econom-
ists do not see it that way. Dewey
wished away the non-democratic
elements in our society 

He went on to say that from
1920 to the present there has been
more equalization of educational
backgrounds, and despite this,
income distributionand the pass-
age ‘of social ‘status has not

‘changed.._, He maintaiiis__'that. edu- .

moting cognitive development and
maturity. butevidence shows that
schools do not promote maturity
and independence. Children are
rewarded for perseverance of
standard /solutions. Furthermore.
thelevel of cognitive skills has
little to do with income and status
transmission. In short. difference
in cognitive skills doesn't say any-
thing about future success.‘-" Gin-
tis said. ' , ,

He emphasized that in order to
reform the schools. an under-
standing must come of the eco-
nomic system: "Schools inust re-
flect economic life or they can-
not promote equalization of in-
come or status transmission. The
social relations of schools mirror
the social relations of economic
life. Today, schools don't pro-

But he warned: “Alas, juvenile

Unlike the situation in capitalist
countries, Shumlin asserted, “ju-
venile delinqueiicy in the Soviet
Union is not‘a natural phenomenon
stemming from the social sys-
tem.”

"It is a result of our mistakes
in the education of youth and an
inability to use all existing oppor-
tunities for the formation of a
higher moral quality."

Shumilin cited the case of \'a—
lery Shelkovnikov. expelled from
a .\'ovosibirsk high school for
"violating discipline."

Shelkovnikov was reinstated,
but after only two weeks of the
new term the teachers gave up
and he was expelled again. The
youth was eventually sentenced to
a year and a half in prison.

Shumlin chided the teachersfor
abdicating their duty "to
no efforts so that young people

Kidney Month at Pitt  

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
has issued a proclamation desig-
nating the month of March Kidney
Month at Pitt and urged all faculty
and students to recognize the con-
tribution that the Kidney Founda-
tion of Western Pennsylvania
makes to the public in battling the
disease. A .

In his proclamation. the Chan-
cellor acknowledged that thou-
sands of Western Pennsylvanians
suffer from many forms of kidney
disease. causing chronic illness.

as a result of high treatment

‘costs. He noted that the Kidney

tion of the problem throughan or-

and patient services.

should show little_concern for the
leisure time of 0' young outside
school."

‘He quoted from a statement to

the police made by a juvenile de—-

linquent from a Ukrainian city. ‘

“When I get out of school,”‘the
youth said, “I usually go stand
around on a corner.” He, com-
plained there was no place to go
except a movie theater, so after a
while “standing around, talking,
and telling jokes,” he and his
friends usually bought a bottle of
vodka at a nearby liquor shop and
drank it in the school yard.

Shumilin pointed to drink as a
prime cause of delinquency. He
said 40 per cent of the minors
who come to trial committed their
crimes while intoxicated. Polls
conducted in reform camps show-
ed 60 per cent of the inmates were
heavy drinkersgbefore they were
16. '

Hentoff identified the United

racy of the school systems as the

‘three greatest forces in the poli-

These forces interact within the

its inadequacies. -

He also cited the sad irony that
Malcolm X and George Jackson
could become intellectuals in pris-

Hentoff stated. "A teacher
should evoke and arouse a sense
of ones own uniqueness in- a stu-

knowledge." He questioned. "Is
not something wrong with educa-

 Reactionary Rhetoric

;eén- Jeff .\lcGee:
 ' l anxiously- read the beginning of yourarticle hoping to find a vai-
-fid male view of Women‘s Liberation or. af the least. some constructive
r._C_riti.cism. But, alas and alack. your article turned out to be nothing new
‘or.lcreative.‘It was merely arguments that have been used against the
,women's movement for the last 100 years.

by JOHN METCALFE

A letter was recently received here which will
not be printed. Parts of it were liinny. and seyeral
questions of possibly general interest were asked.
but the writer committed two sins which cannot be
overlooked. The letter was unsigned. and. in part.
expressed a positive opinion of the paper. this page.
and even this column.

.-\s to the first offense. the Pitt News has a po-
licy that letters must be signed to be considered for
publication. As we are- associated with the L'niver-
sity of Pittsburgh tin anadmittedly vague and un-
official way) we place policy above all other possi-
ble considerations. Neither miracles of cogent
argument. nor lightning from on high. nor yet the
powerful wish to act in our own interests can per-
suade us to swerve from a policy once we have
stumbled across one. We would probably decline to
accept currency. even in large amounts. if the send-
er were unknown to us.

The second’ offense is moreserious. We do not
publish praise of our efforts, not even mild praise.
We already spend a great deal of our time shower-
ing one another with priase, praise so extravagant

it would be embarrassing if it were not so pene- _

tratingly accurate. Our admiration of one another
is exceeded only by the critically acute and sensi-
tive nature of our mutal appreciation. -

Besidesall that. we are afraid we will be trick-
ed into printing what appears to be praise. only to
have it later revealed that a criticism so subtle it

escaped our editorial notice lies concealed within}

Wewill clasp no asps to our breasts. individual or

collective. but rather one another. -
Whoever you are. it was nice to hear from you.
Une question which was raised concerned the

title of this column. Long ago. when I began to .

write for the Pitt News (those of us with winter
birthdays are a year older nowi I encountered a
problem. Anything I submitted would appear in
print under a headline I disliked. or simply could
not understand. I tried to counter this apparent lack
of sensitivit_v toward the Content of my offerings
by writing my own headlines. The effect was dis-
astrous. The staff. or the typesetter. or the sports
editor, or whoever had been inventing those head-
lines had at least managed to have them come out

even across thewidtli of the article in question.

Mine not only did not fit.‘in print. they seemed al-
most supernaturally dumb.

The best solution seemed to be the use of a run-
ning title; this would enable readers to identify
the column quickly without the trouble of remem-
bering some stranger’s name, and eliminate the
problem of dumb headlines. At the very least it
would reduce the number of dumb headlines to one.

1 studied the subject. As in-so many other areas
of life. all the best running titles seemed to be taken
already.. The name of the newspapers offered, no
obvious starting points. "The Pitt Olds"? Too com-
merical. “-The Hit News“? Too much would be ex-
pected of it. A technical aspect of the newspaper

 

 A column And AHa|f

business suggested a solution.

As you study the Pitt News you will notice. it
only subliminall_\. that it is tabloid size. and that
each page is five columns wide. if a story. or art
article. occupied the entire length of a single col-
umn it might look oddly long and narrow. \\‘e do
not wish to appear narrow. If all the stories and
articles were printed in side-by—side vertical sing-
gle columns the effect would be hypotically dull.
One solution to this problem is to break up the space
with cunningly designed advertisements. Greed is
only a secondary motivation. Another way to avoid
dull gray pages isto use varying column widths.
Editorials. for instance. are normally printed two
columns wide. This is called "double column“ in the
trade.

Some newspapers use triple column occasion-
ally. This is the printed equivalent of Cinemascope,
and seems to expect rather too much from the read-
ers. '

The reader is usually bored. We think this is his
fault.

An intermediate tactic in the quest for the read-
er's attention is to print storiesone and a halt col-
umns wide. This is called "column and a half."
Some jargon is surprisingly logical once you know
the trick of it..The use of this device raises some
obvious problems. If a given piece is printed a col-
umn and a half wide. it will leave half a column
dangling over the page somewhere. Most newspeo-

_ ple would find this unprofessional. Unless there is

a story of exactly the same length handy. the thing
to be printed in column and half.is divided into two
parts. which are printed side-by-side.

If I had known how technical all this was, I
would never have chosen the title, much less tried
to explain it. Someday I will explain the use of the
bold-face type which makes some paragraphs look
more important than others. A

0urwriter's other question concerned at young
man with a name strikingly similar to mine. who
was to have begun a feature which would have been
called _"Half a Column." The writer inquired. and
rightlyswhy this should be-. It was observed that
one and a half plus a half equaled. two. the number
of the contributers involved. The writer was con-
cerned as to whatiquality it might be that I possess-
ed. of which my son had only a third as much.

Physical size and native intelligence were re-
jected out of hand. Wit was passed by with a nasty
snicker. and some doubt was expressed whether
good spelling could be the mysterious virtue.

The answer, in fact, is . . . brute strength. Wid-
ened and ravaged by a lifetime of excesses as I am,
I am precisely three times as strong as John Wern-
er Metcalife, who is ten days old today. The ques-
tion, however, is academic. That means that-it is
entirely without practical meaning, and is useful
only as a form of futile entertainment. My son has
declined the offer of Half a Column. '

He called me an adult chauvinist.

I must admit I was a bit amused
and rather surprised by Davis
Fraser's letter concerning my re-
view of the TV rock concerts. I
do know that the entire Loggins
Messina outfit led off In Concert

to me who does what first. I was
reviewing the performances as a
whole, which is why I ignored Bil-
ly Paul's sour note. I mentioned
things about each act I felt note-
worthy. good or bad.

What surprised me was that

' Fraser construed the intent of the

article as anything more than
“opinion.” Any critical article one

Editor. The Pitt News: A

Right on Dave Lynch. l dis-
agree with you about smokers.
Smoking may not be something
you get into. but‘ after hearing
some of your news reports on
WPGH. licking ‘an ashtray may be
just one of your many perversions.

' Smoking may annoy you, but not
smoking annoys me. I find that
cigarettes help me relax and al-
low me to think better ‘during
classes and especially during
exams. Perhaps having two sec-
tions of each class, one for smok-
ers and one for non-smokers, is
the answer. Then no one need be
annoyed. As it stands now, you
want to impose your Puritan
hang-ups on all the rest of us.

He noted that Jencks could be
added to the list of those feeling/
that schooling can't cure any-
thing. “We have a crisis today in
our educational system. Those
who think they can change it with-
out considering economic»prereq-
uistes are making a serious mis-
take,” he concluded.

Stephan Michelsson. from the
Harvard University Center for
Law and Educationxapproached
the problems in schools from a
different economic perspecitve.

‘ He noted that today people are

dealt with on a "contract" basis;
people have no experience work-
ing with strangers on a “non-con-
tract" basis. '

He cited such examples as the
non-involvement attitude which
is prevalent. in mass transit and
hitchhiking. Aside from these. he
noted an article in the New York
Times in which a man committed
suicide after tyring to get help
for 12 hours on a highway when
his car broke down. "True or not.

inability to work with strangers
on a "non-contract" basis.” he
stated.

He said that “contractual” re-
lationships are incorporated in
schools, are “contractual” insti-
tutions. “Schools inhibit students
from making ‘non-contractual’ re-
lationships with their class-
mates,” he said. He cited the
voucher plans and “green-stamp”
reward systems in schools as ex-
amples of performance contracts.
In spite of this, he feels that with
reform, “non-contractual” insti-
tutions are possible.

"The Politics of Schooling" was
discussed by the final speaker. Dr.
Harvey Scribner. who recently
resigned from his post as Chan-
cellor of New York City Public
Schools.

"Let me begin by saying that.
anyone who can say he was his
own man comes out a winner. and
I‘m a winner." Scribner said. This
prefactory remark was made in

light of the fact that Scribner’

came under attack many times
for being "radical'.‘ while in his
post.

He said that his message is a
simple one: public schools are po-
litical institutions and anyone
wanting to change them must
realize this. He also noted that.
despite arguments to the contrary.
schools do provide opportunities
for jobs as professional and para-
professionals. “The precious
search for credentials has not
diminished." he stated.

Scribner noted that many of the
complaints about schools are leg-
itimate: “Schools are turning
away from students. School sys-
tems are in danger of coming
apart at the seams.” He main-

' tained that many of the problems.

arise from false distinctions such
as: “There is a direct relationship

between going to school and grow-'

ing up,” “there is no relationship
between what happens outside and
inside of class,” and “students of
different ability should be separ-
ated into ‘academic’ and ‘voca-
tional’ categories.”

"Nothing less that 'radical‘ re-
form will save schools. Not
change for the sake of change.
not destruction of the present sys-
tem. but modification and re-

form." Scribner emphasized. He
gave some examples of the inade-
quacies of the system: “Twelve
million dollars was spent on se-
curity guards in New York City
public schools. This clearly indi-
cates that too much time is being
spent elsewhere andnot in edu-
cation . . . to show you how ‘ridi-
culous some of the attitudes are—
we have 130.000 Spanish-speaking
youngsters who we think are a
problem. yet. if they were sopho-
mores. we‘d give them credit
for speaking a fluent language.“ ‘

Scribner set priorities which he
feels are critical to reform: (1)
the Board of Education should re
define what “education" -is and
then revise their policies accord-
ing to that definition; (2) a change
of government should take place.

The doors should be closed on the.

4-6.000 student schools: (3) a new
form of teacher education should
be established. Joint programs
between schools and universities
should be created. Teachers
should learn how to teach in a nat-
ural setting and receive on-the-job
credit for teaching regularly; (4)
there should be a redistribution of

Bette /\/lid/er Is The Divine Miss M

by PRESTON RIDGE

Friday night Bette Midler ex-
ploded onto the stage of Syria
Mosque. She is an artist of such
incredible skill that watching her
is a total physical and emotional
drain. There are very few per-
fromers who are so completely
at home on stage as Bette Midler.
She uses every inch of space and
every ovation to build to greater
and greater heights.

About a year and a half ago I

saw her at the Upstairs at the

Downstairs in New York. It was
her first night club booking after
leaving the Continental Baths.
and to say the least she was play-
ing to less than capacity crowds.
However. it was obvious even
then that she was something orig-
inal. and with a little bit of work
could be a top artist. In the year
and a half since then she has de-
veloped that style which encom-
passes the 30's. 40's. 50‘s. and
60’s all tied up in a frantic camp
package. '

Shimmering on stage, looking
like some sort of red-haired Cupie
Doll, she blased into her theme,
“Friends.” She followed this with

' “Empty Bed Blues,” “Bad Sex,”
“Du Run Run,” “Uptown,” ‘‘Del- ,

ta Dawn,”-“Am I Blue,” and
“Higher and Higher.”

Her chatter between songs is

never ending. She tells the audi- L

/ence that she is "the Divine Miss
M. the last of the tacky ladies."
and that the act is "Trash but
trash with a flash." Going fur-
ther she says that she is on a tour
of "the tackiest cities in America
and that Pittsburgh is Numero
Uno." , '

Her three girl back-up team. the

4 Harlettes. open the second half of

the show with "Lullabye of Broad-
way.“ Bette makes her entrance
clad in_ a sliver lame sheath, ac-
cented by a tortured red rose

peaking out of her partially ex-
posed cleavage.

“Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,”
“Leader of the Pack,” “Do You
Love Me,” “Do You Wanta
Dance” and “Chapel of .Love”
serve to accent the fact that she
is truly the undisputed camp.
bombshell of thousands. While
wailing and gyrating all over the
stage, she strips out of the silver
sheath to reveal a rhinestone cor-
set and black toreador pants.

It is when she stands alone in

(‘the spotlight torching "Super-

star." "Am 1 Blue." and "Hello in
There" that the total artist is real-
ized. Reminding one a little of
Judy Garland and Barbara Streis-
and. yet fully unique in her own
right. her delivery of these songs
is deep. emotional. and ever so

urgent.

The Harlaettes provide just the '

right amount of trashiness to

‘highlight Miss M. spending part

of the evening sitting. like three
hustlers. under a plastic palm
tree. Also. in Bette‘s entourage
are her drummer. two guitar
players. and the very talented
Barry Manilow. who is the ar-
ranger. conductor. and piano
player.

When all is said and done it is
the Divine Miss M who is the total
star of the show. The near capaci-
ty crowd at the Mosque seemed
to feel that way also. giving her
encore after encore. And it was
fitting because they were watch-

_ing‘a superstar who could. very

well emerge from the 70’s as a
living legend.

R Nothing ‘New’,

By ANDREW J. sopxo
Arts Editor

“There is nothing new under
the sun." So the prophet tells
us. despite theclaims of new.
improved cleaning agents and
yes. despite even the claims of
the new music at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

For what it's worth. we had
more of this new (impr0ved?l—
music served to us in a Music
Department concert at the Frick
Auditorium this past week. And
after siich an experience. we
must sincerely ask.. was there
anything about it that was
really new and inventive‘?

There was the commonplace
mixture of electronic tapeand
the dissonance.
of brass and percussion. the insis-

_ tence that instruments be._bang-

the pre-
prepared

ed rather than played.
sence of the perenial
piano. and the usual on—stage
shenanigans which entertain
but do littleelse; In" effect. we
had the same old stuff placed‘
before us. nothing more; noth-
ingless.. '

Beginning with Wesley Ward's
f'Odes for Chamber Brass." a‘
rather conservative piece dedi-
cated to_ charlatan Gregory Ras-
putin. we' were given‘ a» short
lesson in theimportance of both
sound and silence within the
framework of a musical compo-
sition.

This was followed in grate-
fully quick succession by Frank
Richmond's "Variable Sets 1."
Dan Meese's "Saxophone Quar-

mits for String Quartet." ll
admit to listing these works
with0ut'comment in a partial
concession to composer Allen
Strange"s suggestion that I mere-
ly mention new works rather
than criticize them but I also
admit that I do this in light of
my own artistic judgments. i.e.
these works deserve little more
than mention.) -

If we are to gauge success
by audience response. the award
for this program goes without
qualification to two theatre piec-
es by A1ain’Louvier. “Promen-
ade for Alto Flute" and "Pre-
ludes for the Strings of the Pia-
no.“ Although the two works
bore absolutely no relation to one
another. they were performed
simultaneously with a fair
amount of success. Flautist Ber-
nard Goldberg wandered through-
out the auditorium producing
everything from Bronx cheers to
plaintive puppy whelps
his instrument. Not surprising-
ly. Debussy‘s "Faun" appeared
in the midst of all this mad-
ness as well. i

the pianist profoundly 7examin-
ed _the potentialities of his in-
strument‘s "innards."

One. must, feel a certain
amount of sympathy in this re-
gard: while the artist even aim-
ed his pistol at the piano. he
designed not to shoot it. thus
refusing to put the instrument
out of its misery. Does anyone
out there have the Humane So-
ciety‘s number‘? i

The balance of the program
consisted of a composition which
preportedly was inspired by Chi-
nese calligraphy. a Berg ada-
gio for violin. clarinet. and
piano. and a piece for two saxo-

-phones and electronic tape by

Bruce Johnson. As much as I
have tried to forget the’ last
piece. prophetically entitled
its sheer ugli-
ness caused such displeasure that
this listener had no qualms in
addressing whatever the piece
was attempting to express with
a number of unrepeatable oaths.

One. of course. may end all

reflection upon the new music by
dismissing it as nothing" more
than a prime example of noise
pollution. This. however would
be a .little harsh. In reality. the
new music may be doing a ser-
vice for both the cultural and
the ecological environment. pro-
vided it‘s printed on recyclable
paper. '

The outcome of last night‘s contest between the Pitt
Hockey Club and the Duquesne Dukes was predictable.
Pitt won the game. 4-2. but what everyone was waiting for
finally came about in the 11:55 mark.

After moving into the third period deadlocked at 2-2.
Pitt grabbed the momentum and scored a pair of unan-
swered goals. With 3:05 left. Gary Cummings pulled down

' the Dukes C. H. Bender from behind. drawing a penalty.

Bender. however, was slow getting to his feet.

Duke Schaeffer rushed to Cummings aid as the fight broke

The Pitt indoor track and field -

this past weekend a third and
fourth place. Bill Rea, Olympic al-.
ternate and All-American long
jumper. took third in the NCAA
with a distance of" 25.1114. The two-
mile relay team came in fourth.

-Hoping to take first or second

jumped by Olympic champion
Randy Williams who jumped 26.4
and Al Lanier who got 26.2.‘

"It was some of',,the greatest
competition I've ever seen." com-
mented head coach Jim Banner.

“‘Bill is a great competitor,”
continued Banner.

1 Two minutes later. Bender cranked up a shot from

about five feet inside the Pitt blue line that was headed
between Macks legs. Mack went downand made the save
but the rebound went directly out to Mike Sczurko who had
the Pitt goalie at his mercy.

. After managing only three shots on Mack in the first’

period. the Dukes out shot Pitt. 12-10. in the second.

Bender took things into his own hands in the third‘i"' I

period and began to start end to end rushes every chance
he had. He finally stickhandled through the entire Pitt

team to break in alone on Mack from the extreme right  
wing. Bender cut across the crease on the backhand but

Bob Rodgers, who was compet-

optional exercises. “He had no

Perez.

Pitt'_s other ray of hope. Dick

deal from the officials. as well as
some other mishaps.

"Pribis was underscored on

Pribis also was hurt by a mis-
calculation on Perez’ fault. “I' told
him not to repeat his vault,” ex-
plained Perez. “Then I was shock-
ed to find out what the judges
gave him.”

Neiger concurred with Perez.
"1 think he was a little under-

ran into trouble because he was

“In the vaulting, Pribis had a

his form and height could have
been better,” commented Neig-
er.

Wallace did not do well enough '

managed to get into the consola-
tion finals. In the consolations. he
beat everyone there. including the
swimmers in the “Big Finals" in
the 100-yard backstroke but could
not be awarded first place be-
cause of his earlier showing. He
established a new Pitt team rec-

NCAA’s. John Templin did some
very good times in the 100 and 200-
