Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Student Government Board inter- .

viewed, selected and announced Nicholas
Hufnagel as its new Board member last
night.

The Board selected Hufnagel, a junior
majoring in French and urban studies,
from a pool of 24 applicants, who under-
went public interviews Tuesday night in
Nordy’s Place. _ V i

“I felt like this was a chance to get more

involved on campus because I’m going to ‘

be a senior,” Hufnagel said.

Board President Mike Nites said 34
students applied for the position since he
posted applications last Thursday night.

The Board divided the interview into
two rounds and questioned each applicant
for ﬁfteen minutes.

The Boardinterviewed the applicants
in a two round process, with the ﬁrst round
lasting until 9:50 p.m. Nites interviewed

any applicants who were not available to _ L

attend the session over speakerphone.

Each of the six present Board members
asked the applicant a question, including
inquiries about each applicant’s schedule
and project ideas:

Board member Sara Klein asked appli-
cants to tell the Board about themselves
in about 30 seconds or less.

Board member Graeme Meyer asked
applicants about projects they intend to
work on if chosen for the position.

Board member Ellie Tsatsos asked ap-
plicants why they did not run for Student
Government last semester and what made
them decide to apply for the open posi-
tion. P

Board member Abby Zurschmit fo-
cused on logistics, asking applicants if
they had ever attended a Student Govern-
ment Board public meeting before and if
applicants would be available Tuesday

The people resting on their knees along Lib-
erty Avenue this week aren’t waitingfor abus.
They’re kneeling in prayer.

Today starts 40 days of continuous abor-

 

tion protest by the nationwide Christian pro-
life group, 40 Days for Life, whose members
biannually demonstrate against the abortion
services provided by Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood provides family plan-
ning and sexual health services such as STD
testing, cancer screenings, contraception

counseling and prescription and abortions.
The Pittsburgh chapter of 40 Days for Life will
gather outside of the Liberty Avenue location
Downtown.

The group plans to have at least two people
represenﬁngtheir organization by prayingfor
12 hours per day, seven days a week through-

out the 40 days.

During this ﬁme frame Planned Parent-
hood and Vox — Voices of Plarmed Parent-

When Laura Palmer graduated from
Oberlin College in the ‘70s, she had no
intention ofjoining U.S. troops in the
jungles of Vietnam.

“I was going to go to law school and
get the‘ Black Panthers out of jail,” Palmer
said, referencing the black activist group
that arose in the 19605. I V

Instead, she ended up traveling to
Vietnam “with a pediatrician [she]’had
met illegally hitchhiking on the inter-
state” and, eventually, reported the fall
of Saigon in 1975.

Palmer and a panel of others told the
story of the Vietnam War from their own

perspectives Tuesday evening at the Uni—'

versity Club. The event, titled Vietnam:

New Lessons from an Old War, a Half— '

Century On, hosted by the University
Honors College, included five profes-
sionals -- journalists, politicians and
veterans —— engaged in a panel discussion
and Q—and-A to a standing-room-only
crowd. The evening aimed to uncover
what was, and still is, the Vietnam War.
Cindy Skrzycki, a senior lecturer in Pitt’s
English Department, helped assemble
the panel.

Panelists included Bob Kerrey, a Viet-
nam veteran who received the Congres-
sional Medal of Honor and was a former

, U.S. senator and governor from Nebras-

ka; Peter Arnett, the winner of a Pulitzer
Prize for his work on the Vietnam War

discussion in which the panelists shed
light on a conflict that reshaped domestic

politics and life in_.the‘United States.

nights at 8 p.m. and Friday afternoons to
ﬁt the new Board member’s schedule. Ni-
tes added that the Board could reschedule
if necessary.

Nites asked applicants to name what
things they would look for if a student
group asked for allocations to fund a cul-
tural event on campus.

Board members Mona Kazour and An-
drew Abboud asked applicants to name
three of the nine Student Government

Committees. ,

Board member Brandon Benjamin had
an unexcused absence.

After Board members ﬁnished the ﬁrst
round of interviews, the Board broke for
private deliberations, which lasted for
about 45 minutes.

The Board forgot to call one of the ap-
plicants —— Elizabeth Smolinski, a sopho-
more majoring in marketing —— and had to
stop deliberations to interview Smolinski
before returning to deliberations for about
another two minutes.

After private deliberations, Board
members announced four applicants they

chose to consider in a second round of
interviews: Nicholas Hufnag'el, Andrew
Stefanick, Meghan Murphy and Benjamin
West. 1

The four remaining applicants were
then notiﬁed by the Board members and
returned for a second round of interviews
that lasted for about an hour.

The Board members asked each ap-
plicant an additional 15 minutes of ques-
tions, including: A ’

Klein asked applicants how well they
collaborate with others.

Meyer asked applicants how they
would describe the concept of shared re-

sponsibility when it comes to allocations
between student groups and the Board.
Tsatsos asked candidates what some of
their other major commitments would be
outside of SGB. H
Zurschmit asked candidates to de-
scribe what type of leader they are.
Nites asked candidates how they would
increase transparency and solve any dis-
connect that is happening between the
Board and the student body.
Kazour asked candidates to describe a

outside the facility to escort patients inside
if they want assistance and help them avoid
the demonstrators.

Vox President and Pitt sophomore Mau-
reen Deken said she has known some protes-
tors toactas counselorsto women entering
Planned Parenthood clinics in an attempt to
convince them to: seek help elsewhere. I u .

“But a lot of the other clinics don’t offer
contraceptive services like Planned Parent-
hood does, especially notfor free,” Dekensaid.

Aceording ,to?9lleigl1a Cavalier, public af-
fairs diréctor of Planned Parenthood for West-
ern Pennsylvania, more than 90 percent of all
the services provided by Planned Parenthood
are prevention related, such as bfeast cancer T
screenings and contraception. _

Cavalier said she thinks the protests are
“designed to intimidate the patients.”

Pitt’s pro-life 4student‘organization, Stu-

dents for Life, often sends members tojoinin. -—

in the dignity of every human life.

Ciccocioppo said she believes human life
starts at the moment of conception and that
the life created in the moment is no less valu-
able than the lives of people who have already
been born.

“Anembryo is a unique human being,” ‘

Ciccocioppo said. “You can’t really debate
the facts. One of my goals is to get people to

' talk about the issue.”

 Bruni, campaign director of40 Days
for. Lifein Pittsburgh, said she thinks “pro-

f lifers” are unfairly stereotyped as aggressive. u

Raised as an Evangelical Christian, Bruni said

her orgar1ization‘has'a statement of peace P
that everyperson must sign if they want to _—

be aﬂiliated with the group.

“It’s really a prayer vigil, not a protest,”
Bruni- said. .‘7-"1‘here’s a small percentage of
pro-lifers who I’ve met who are‘ a little bit

a fanatical. Sometimes we’ll getpeople who

they wouldn’t mind leaving.” - ' ‘*”j
T Deken defended the duties of Planned

u Parentho_od.

’ “Planned Parenthood does more to pre-

, vent the need for abortion than any, agency 9
in the state,” Deken. said. “They do. a lot of .—

really great work. ‘But I also believe fully that

. the abortion part of Planned Parenthood is

completely necessary for the health and well-

being of a lot of people.”

Bruni, almost 50 years old, said that when
she ﬁrst joined 40 Days for Life more than
eight years ago, the group consisted of mostly
older people. She’s now pleasantly surprised
at the number of youngpeople who volunteer
with the pro—life movement.

“I think the young generation is more pro-
life,” Bruni said. “Back in the ’70s when abor-
tionwas made legal, therewas a lot of rhetoric
about it, thinking that it was a woman’s right
and that it wasn’t a baby. Nobody’s arguing
that it’s not a baby anymore. It’s just about
whether if it’s awoman’s right to kill it or not.”

Gallup data from May 2013 shows that 57
percent of millennials, thoseages 18 to 34,
identiﬁed as pro-life, and 23 percent of the
group said abortion should be illegal in all
circumstances, including rape and incest. For
many, abortion is a political issue. Deken said
she believes a life begins when it can survive
outside of the womb, and that to make abor-

‘ tionillegal would be an overreach in power

by thefgovemment.

‘ - “The fetus is still a part of its parent’s body
until  is ableto survive without being inside
its pair}/Eé;nt,”'Deken said. “By forcing a person
to carryout their pregnancy to term against
their the government would be seriously
infringing upon that person’s right to bodily
autonomy.”

Emily MacLean, vice president of Cam-
pus Women’s Organization, said she plans
to spend a few Saturdays volunteering as a
patient escort, a person who assists patients
with entering Planned Parenthood, and hopes
to encourage other CWO members to do the
same.

“If you’re there to help women and help
them not feel judged and harassed, any dis-
comfort that you’re going to feel is going to
be balanced out by helping people out,” Ma-
cLean, a senior psychology major, said.

A Pittsburgh city ordinance states that
protesters may not enterwithin 15 feet of the
front door of the facility and they may not
block the door, Cavalier said. Planned Parent-
hood patient escorts must also followastrict
“non.-engagement” policy with protesters so
that arguments or ﬁghts do not erupt.

“There are some people who believe that
the dignity of the human being is based on
whether the parents ‘want them’ or not, and
I very much disagree with that,” Ciccocioppo
said. _

Personal beliefs continue to make abor-
tion adivisive issue. “People of non-Christian
faiths and people without a faiththink dif-
ferently,” Deken said. “The concept that a
person’s life begins at conception is not shared
by all people.” I

nationwide.

“There was no censorship during the
Vietnam War, and that affected the way it
was viewed,” Arnett said. “You saw dead ‘
bodies and bomb blasts.” ‘

Women, previously unrepresented
among the ranksof the press corps dur-
ing wartime, were granted a new oppor-

- tunity in light of shifting social norms

and lawsuits against discrimination in
newsrooms, such as the lawsuit filed by
the female employees of The New York

_Times against the newspaper’s publisher

in the early 1970s.,

“There was a lot of access. The fact
that I was 22 years old and able to get a
press pass and hop on choppers opened
up opportunities,” Palmer said. “Women
earned a spot at the table.”

Arnett agreed that the war aided in
launching young journalists’ careers,
which were “built on relationships with

[journalists and political leaders] in
Vietnam.”

One of the aims of the evening was to
use the Vietnam War as a tool to teach
older and younger generations alike
about lessons that Americans should
have, and still should, learn.

Kerrey said that it is important to take
the time to acquire sympathy to better
understand war and those involved. In
this case, he said that people often over-

look the more than 500,000 Vietnam '

civilian casualties.

“They don’t have their wall,” Kerrey
said. -

Most traditional Pitt students might
only know Vietnam through the eyes of

veteran family and community members

and memorial tributes on TV, because
the war, fought between 1962 and 1975
is too far in the past for 18- to 22-year-
olds to fathom. »

Miller, born in 1969, was the youngest
of the panelists and said he studies the
war from a historical standpoint. After
completing his undergraduate degree

in history, Miller focused his graduate
studies in the 1990s on the Vietnam War’s
aftermath, seeking the perspectives of
non—Americans.

The war, according to Miller, is a glob-
al history event that bridges the experi-
ence of the Vietnamese and Americans,
but the modern Vietnamese remember
the war through a common narrative. The
country’s communist party established
a narrative of nationalist victory over
foreign invaders, which is still unclear
and up for debate today.

Many members of the largely under
40-year-old population are still coming
to grips with the sadness tied to their
country’s past, according to Miller.

Audience members attended the event
to gain a better understanding of the
war’s significance in U.S. history.

Cornelia Davis, retired Pitt professor .
- and former Pittsburgh board of public

education arts and humanities chair-
woman, said she was outside of the U.S.
during the Vietnam War.

“And I was hoping that tonight’s event

would provide me with a sort of intro-
spective view on the feelings about the
war in the U.S.,” she said.

Skrzycki said the Vietnam War raised '

an abundance of questions about the mo-
rality of war, the fairness and unfairness
of the draft as well as insight into the
culture of protests.

“Vietnam was a fulcrum for change in
the U.S,” she said.

While the panelists posed various per-
spectives on the war, they all agreed on
its heavy impact on their lives. V

For Vallely, the combat sparked a sub-
sequent interest in the humanities, rang-
ing from music to poetry, as he worked
to move on from the war that he said

« largely created him.

“I became a more interesting person,”
Vallely said. “Ignorance is terrible. Be-
fore you embark on something, you want
to learn as much as you can.”

Palmer, on the other hand, said the

war provided a lesson in love.

“Love has bonds that can’t be shat-
tered and that bullets can’t kill,” Palmer
said. “Wars don’t end. They come home,
and the women and children carry on
the ﬁght.”

As the war winded down in 1975,
Palmer was sitting in the Continental
Hotel in Saigon when she heard pound-
ing on her door. The capital had fallen,
and she boarded a U.S. Marine helicop-
ter to evacuate “a country that [she] so
deeply loved.”

Clutching the hand of afellow journal-
ist, she “was forced to watch a country
slip away.”

“I call Saigon my hometown because
that is where the rest of my life began,”
Palmer said. I

What is ‘so just about the doctrine of academic freedom?

Thomas Helgerman
Columrzist

As a country, the United States holds its allies
close and its First Amendment rights closer.

Just as freedom of speech is cherished in the
public sphere, academic freedom is held clear

by those in academia.
Academic freedomis more or less the idea

A that academics should be able to research and

publish material without censorship based on
the content oftheirstudies. TheAmericanAs-
sociation ofUniversity Professors ﬂeshesthis
out in its Statement of Principles on Academic

‘Freedom and Tenure, ﬁrst released in 1940,
which was the de facto statement on what
composes the concept.

Two weeks ago, a piece published in The
Harvard Crimson challenged this as a stan-
dard for academic work and suggested that
we replace this with what the author called

academic justice: “When an academic commu-
nity observes researcli promoting or justifying

V oppression, it should ensure thatthis research

does not continue.”

As with analogous suggestions to curtail
freedom of speech in particular situations,
this piece has received criticism, mostly from

the politically right. The arguments advanced
by critics are similar, decrying the standards
underlying academic freedom as subjective,
“value-based” rules constructed inanebulous
fashion.

While this is certainly valid criticism,
these points are part of the standard canon
of libertarian critiques. By sticking to their
ideological guns, detractors have missed the
gaping holes in the argumentation backing
academic justice. '

First, upon closer inspection, it appears
that academic justice is actually compatible

with academic freedom.‘ This is because to
argue against the doctrine of academic free-
dom, the author sets upastrawmanto criticize
and replace it rather than grappling with the
full concept.

The Crimson piece cites that the AAUP’s
statement deﬁnes academic freedom as the

notion that “teachers are entitled to full free- —

dom in research and in the publication of the
results.” However; the document itselfdeﬁnes
academic freedom as the collection of three
tenets, and the Crimson article cites only one.

It is really the third tenet with which aca-
demic justice conﬂicts, particularly when it
states, “When [teachers] speak or write as
citizens, they should be free from institu-
tional censorship or discipline.” This clearly

contradicts the example 0 “appropriate and

commendable” action cited by the author, in
which a Harvard summer school instructor

was unable to teach at the university because
of a community reaction to hateful comments
he had published.

Nevertheless, farther down in the AAUP’s
document, the body writes that it is acceptable
for universities to take actionagainsteducators
if they violate certain principles, including
showing “respect for the opinions of others.”
Clearly, instances of hate speech seemingly
step over this line.

Thus, at the point at which the doctrine of
academic freedom includes alist of acceptable
circumstances to takeaction against academ-
ics who have stepped out of line, academic

justice becomes an interpretation or proposed
change to a tenet of the former, not a frame-
work intended to replace it.

Second, most of the examples — all exclud-

ing the American Studies Association boycott
of Israeli universities, a-{higlily controversial
issue — given by the author of academic jus-
tice being delivered by the community ﬁt her
deﬁnition of the concept very poorly.

In sum, two are presented: the expulsion
of the Harvard summer school instructor
discussed earlier and the Harvard-Radcliffe
Students for a Democratic Society’s protests

of Richard Herrnstein’s psychology lecuires -

at Harvard in response to his public support
of the thesis that intelligence is genetically
determined and thus, varies. from race to race.

There are a couple of things to note about
these examples. The ﬁrst is that they were
largely unsuccessful. In the case ofHerrnstein,
not only did the university decline to take ac-
tion against him,but he was able to write and
release a New York Times best—selling (and
highly controversial) book “The Bell Curve”
with political scientist Charles Murray, which
brought his thoughts on the matter to thefore-

front of public discussion. « .
Even inthe other example, in which Subra—
manian Swamywas not invited back to lecture
at Harvard, he is still a prominent ﬁgure in
Indian politics. The question is, why have at~

/tempts to enact academic justice repeatedly

failed? The answer is simple: Criticism has

never originated from within the academic

community.

In her deﬁnition of academic justice, the
author of the Crimson article writes that the
academic communitymust act to counter

oppressive research, but the majority of her A

examples showcase student action. While stu-
dents might be physically present where most
academic work takes place, they are not part

of the abstract academic community, as they ‘

are not yet experienced enough in their ﬁeld
to contribute meaningfully.

Thus, it seems that academic justice not
only fails to contradict the current doctrine of
academic freedom, but its action as imagined
by the Crimson is also ineffectual. The idea is
not without promise, but it certainly needs to
be reworked to be taken seriously. I

ACC BREAKDOWN

  Duke-UNC clash 
dwindling regular season

* H Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Duke hosts North Carolina on Saturday in a
game that will likely decide the ACC’s third-
place team._Naturally, members of Duke’s
student body have been camping outside
ticket ofﬁces all week to secure one of the
9,314 seats in Cameron Indoor Stadium for
the 9 p.m. tipoff.

Standing in Duke’s way to a No. 1 seed in

4 the NCAA Tournament is one of the hottest

teams in college basketball. The Tar Heels
have won 12 consecutive games, and they
beat Duke (74-66) in the teams’ ﬁrst meeting
a little more than two weeks ago. V

Yet, Duke’s star freshman, Jabari Parker,
has added more dimension to his game as
the season has progressed. Parker leads the
ACC in double-doubles (12), rebounding (8.9
boards per game) and is second in scoring
(18.8 points per game). He is also projected by
many to be selected No. 1 overall in the 2014
NBA Draft in latejune, if he chooses to enter.

But Parker is also far from being one-
dimensional with enterprise talents.

The Duke faithﬁil got a taste of Parker’s
culinary creation, “Jabari Bars,” Monday,
and if the food reviews are free ofbias, Parker
might become more ﬁnancially secure if he
elects to open a bakery in the near ﬁiture.

‘Parker threw on an apron Monday to
bake his patented dessert in bulk and pro-
vided hundreds of Cameron Crazies with

- something to munch on while studying in»

their tents. ,

“The Crazies have been out there for
weeks. Thejabari Bars are what they need,”
Parker said in a video released by Duke Ath-
letics.

Parker insisted the recipe be kept “top-
secret,” but in the video, he uses a combina-
tion of crushed graham crackers, coconut,
chocolate chips and lots of butter. He made
the ﬁrst Jabari Bar when he was in seventh
grade.

One Crazy awarded the bars a12 out of 10.
Another, an 11. Parker wasn’t sure if the Cra-

Arkin -: 1'c:"fni ‘|‘rﬂ1‘:ih'1 M’: D At ‘t ' rmnrm ?: 1‘I*rP1ri4'PY" 

zies’ biases were bluff or ﬂuff, but he said he’s
sure his family and‘ native friends of Chicago
wouldn’t sugarcoat their reviews. '

“They think I’m'the bomb when it comes
to this dessert,” he said. S

Parker said the bars “help your handles”
because the graham—cracker-crushing pro-
cess exercises hands and builds forearm
muscle. With a straight face, he compared
the conceptual duties of basketball to work
in the kitchen.

“Basketball and cooking are kind of simi-
lar because, for me,~I don’t use measuring
cups,” he said. ‘‘So it’s all about sight, it’s all
about feel, it’s all about being aware.”

Obscure analogies aside, all we can be sure
of is that both teams and their followings are
hungry forawin — regardless of the number
ofjabari Bars eaten. ‘

Here are The Pitt News’ updated ACC
powerrankings.

1. Virginia (25-5, 16-1 ACC)

In the unofﬁcial ACC regular-season
championship game, the Cavaliers dis-
mantled Syracuse, 75-56, claiming the N o. 1
seed in the ACC Tournament. Guard Malcolm
Brogdon has now scored 10 or more points
in 17 consecutive games — an ACC best —
including 13 games with 14 or more points.

2. Syracuse (26-3, 13-3 ACC)

The Orange have lost three of their past
four games, and in two weeks, they’ve gone
from No. 1 to No. 7 in the national rankings.
Point guard Tyler Ennis is still at the top of
his game, though, leading the ACC in assists
(5.6) and steals (2.1). If Ennis can hold the
top spot after the ﬁnale against Florida State
on Sunday, he would-become the ﬁrst—ever
freshman to accomplish the feat.

T-3 Duke (23-6, 12-4 ACC)

Lopsided scoring totals have been a theme
forthe Blue Devils this season. They have had

. at least one 20-point scorer in 22 games this

season, and their exceptional 3-point shoot-
ing has continued. Andre Dawkins (.447),

Undersized Panthers face Wake Forest in ACC Tournament

Dan Sostek
Staﬁ” Writer

There’s no getting around the improb-
ability that Pitt will take the ACC Tour-
nament by storm. Highlighted by un-
defeated, second-ranked Notre Dame,
six of the conference’s teams ﬁnished
the regular season ranked in The As-
sociated Press Top 25.

But the Panthers won’t have to worry
about running into any of the tough ACC
powerhouses just yet. Instead, they’ll
focus on a lesser opponent, who just
happens to _have one of the conference’s
toughest individual performers.

The Pitt women’s basketball team
is in Greensboro, N.C., participating
in its first conference tournament as a
member of the ACC. Pitt, seeded 14th of
15 teams, will take on the 11th-seeded
Wake Forest Demon Deacons (14-15, 5-11
ACC) Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.

The Panthers, led by first-year head
coach Suzie McConnell-Serio, went 11-
19 overall i‘n_t_he former Duquesne head

a great conference,” she said follow-
ing the Panthers’ 79-68 loss to North
Carolina State in last Thursday’s home
ﬁnale. “Our goal is to close that gap.”

If the Panthers going to begin to
close that gap this season, particularly
against a Wake Forest team that de-
feated the Panthers earlier in February
by a score of 74-70, they need to take
specific measures in order to do so.

The doors to relevancy‘ in the tour-
nament might seem barred from the
Panthers, but there are a few keys that
might loosen the lock.

Five keys for Pitt against Wake For-
est:

Play big inside: This seems trite and
even a bit redundant, but regardless, it
is a must for the Panthers. When 6-foot-
11 redshirt freshman center Marvadene
“Bubbles” Anderson went down for the
season with a torn ACL, the team in-
stantly became one of the smallest in
the ACC. Standing a modest 6-feet tall,

 college forward

announces _comn1itment to Pitt

Tyler. Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Tyrone Haughton, a 6-foot—9 junior col’- pi
lege forward, has committed to play bas- ’

ketball at Pitt, accordingto his Twitter
feed.  
“OFFICIALLYVA PANTHER,” Haughto
(@44tyrone) tweeted Tuesday night.
("After graduating from Dr. Michael
M. ~Kr_o‘p High School in Miami in 2012,
Haughton played for two years at Iowa
Western Community College. As a fresh-

‘ man, he broke the program’s record for

blocks in a season with 112 and averaged
4.5 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.
Haughton has two years of eligibility
left and at 210 pounds, might be a fit for
the center position in 2014-2015 after
Talib Zanna graduates at the end of this
season. . .
He received offers from Fresno State,

Memphis, San Jose State, Tennessee,

Texas Tech and Wichita State, but a re-
cent trip to campus might have swayed
Haughton toward Pittsburgh.

. Haughton visited Pitt on March 2 and
attended the Panthers’ game Monday
night against North Carolina State at the
Petersen Events Center. Although Pitt

4 lost the game, 74-67, Haughton praised
the environment throughout the night '

and followed up with more encourag-
ing words on his Twitter early Tuesday
morning.

“Everyone in Pittsburgh show[s] mad
love,” he tweeted alongside other tweets
that commented on the atmosphere in
the Oakland Zoo and a love for the Uni-
versity, team and staff. ’ '

If the verbal commitment sticks, and
Pitt signs Haughton, its 2014 class would
sit at four signees; Shaquille Doorson,-
Ryan Luther and Sheldonjeter have al-
ready signed. %

while also setting another Petersen,Events

leads the ACC in scoring with an average of

      

24.2 points per game.

Terrapins junior guard Dez Wells rnightbe
the brightest part of a disappointing season
for Maryland. Wells leads the team in scor-
ing (14.8 points per game) and is shooting
47.8 percent from the ﬂoor. Additionally, he’s
scored 11 or more points in25 of his 29 games.

10. Miami (15-14, 6-10 ACC)

The Hurricanes host Wake Forest on
Saturday at 2 p.m. to conclude a lackluster
campaign. Guard Rion Brown has scored 10
or more points in 11 consecutive games, and
he leads Miami in both scoring average (15.0
points per game) and rebounding average
(6.2 boards).

11. Notre Dame (15-16, 6-12 ACC)

The Irish’s loss at North Carolina marked
the end of their regulariseason. Guard Eric
Atkins is fourth among ACC players in career

scoringwith 1,387 points. He’s also been play-
ing his best basketball of the season lately,
averaging 17 points and 6.5 assists during
his last two contests.

Four of the Demon Deacons’ starters
scored in double ﬁgures, but lowly Wake
Forest still lost to even‘ more lowly Boston

13. Georgia Tech (13-16, 4-12 ACC)

The Yellow Jackets ﬁnish their season
against Virginia Tech on Saturday at 2 p.m.
Senior Daniel Miller has blocked at least one
shot in 107 of his 122 career games and is 12th
on the ACC all—time blocked shot list with 276.

14. Boston College (8-21, 4-12 ACC)

The Eagles travel to play North Carolina
State on Sunday at 6 p.m. Guard Olivier Han-
lan has scored 10 or more points in 36 of his
past 38 games. A sophomore, Hanlan is aver-
aging about 18 points per game and already
has amassed more than 1,000 career points.

15. Virginia Tech (9-19, 2-14 ACC)

Freshman- point guard and Montour
High School graduate Devin Wilson is sec-

ond among ACC players in assists (4.79), and -

he gets to the free-throw line more than any
ACC freshman, attempting roughly 6.2 free-
throws per game. H?

problems. Pitt obviously‘ needs Logan
to step up even if she doesn’t size up,
but it will have to be a team effort to
key in on and limit the effectiveness of
a player as good as Hamby.

Shooting Efficiency: One of the big-
gest issues for the Panthers this season
has been their tendency to go cold from
the field for long stretches of time, al-
lowing teams to either capture or ex-
tend the lead. The team as a whole ra-nks
last in the ACC in f1eld—goal percentage,
shooting an anemic 37 percent from
the field. When they are hitting their

  

compiling an 8-3 record when shoot-
ing above 40 percent from the field
this season. Since Pitt’s lack of size is
likely to stymie an inside game, shoot-
ing efficiency is a must, especially from
3-point range, where, unsurprisingly,
Pitt’s 28.5 percent shooting ranks last
in the ACC. '
Kiesel Must Carry: Junior point
guard Brianna Kiesel has been the un-
questioned star for the Panthers this
entire season, elevating her game upon
entering the ACC. The 5-foot—7 Kiesel

other player. But that reliance is also
perhaps Kiesel’s biggest detractor. She
has played all 40 minutes in six of the
team’s final 15 games, and that heavy
workload could ﬁnally catch up to the

 relentless floor general.’
3  Find Kiesel’s Robin:lKieselneeds to
 play well for the Panthers to thrive, but

more often than not the Panthers usual-

ly need both Batman and Robin in order -

to win. It hasn’t been consistently one
player, but it will likely need to be ei-
ther Logan, redshirt sophomore guard
Loliya Briggs or senior guard Marquel

D_avis. Logan, who is 30 points away

from 1,000 for her career, enters the
final chapter of her collegiate career,
but she needs to be more consistent
offensively in order to thrive. Briggs
and Davis have often shown flashes of
potential throughout their careers, but

’ disappear in games too often. One of

these three will need to provide a vi-
able second option so Wake Forest car1_’t
