Crossing

Forbes

presents

hazard

By Skip Leezer
Staﬂ“ Wﬁter

Class ends, and you walk out
of David Lawrence Hall trying to
find the best way across Forbes
Avenue. The options are simple:
Use the skyway or walk down
the block to the crosswalks —- or
fight the traffic on Forbes Avenue
and walk across the street.

According to Tom Hussey,
associate vice president’ for
facilities management, students
crossing Forbes Avenue in front
of David Lawrence Hall has been
a “problem for a long time. ~

Hussey said the UI1lV€l pity
contacted the city last year and
asked it to look at two problem
spots on the campus, Forbes
Avenue at David Lawrence and
Bigelow Boulevard by the
Cathedral of Learning.

Matt Wa_lsl.1_,‘V.:§;1V.§)e_rvisor of the
painting, division in the city’s
Department of Public Works, said,
“There’s not much we can do.
Sometimes the shortest distance
between two points is not the
safest” '

Two students, who Hussey
would not identify, met with City
Council member Bernard Regan
last year about the problem. There
was “no resolution to the issue,”
Hussey said. I

The counsil considered the
option of putting in new lights
and crosswalks, but it decided
against this because it “felt it was
dangerous and slowed down
traffic by the Cathedral," Hussey
said.

“I don’t want to see anyone get
hurt,” said Walsh, who has agreed

to pull out the closed file on the

Pitt groups attack child—care problem

By Megan Bertino
Asst. News Editor

Groups have formed to improve child—care
availability at Pitt, a problem which university
officials say they have been researching for
years. i

The university’s child-care facility, located
in Bellefield Annex, can currently
accommodate 100 children for full—time care
and no accommodations for part-time care.

According to Rhonda Gross, director of
budget and audit, the center ‘is budgeted
$5,000 per year but actually receives an
additional $50,000 worth of university services.

The services include a reduced rent rate

and waived overhead fees, including
accounting, payroll and personnel services,
Gross said.

The $5,000 budget is used to pay for 25
percent of the price of child care for parents
who qualify, according to Jerlean Daniel,
director of the University Child Development
Center.

Although the center receives a reduced
rent rate, other organizations in Bellefield
Annex, such as the Pittsburgh Opera Theatre,
don’t pay rent, said Lori Shorr, chairperson of
the Coalition for Child Care at Pitt.

CCCP also claims that Pitt’s child care is
overly expensive. Pitt’s day care costs $459 a
month for infants, $450 for toddlers and $382

for pre-schoolers.

But Pitt’s day care prices are comparable to
other private day-care facilities in Pittsburgh.

The Little Bear Child Development Center
costs $595 a month for infants, $495 for
toddlers and $299 for pre-schoolers. Kinder
Care costs $436 a month for infants, $396 for
toddlers and $320 for pre-schoolers.

Although the waiting list at Pitt is six to 12
months, many parents place their children on
the list a year in advance, Daniel said. The
long waiting list is deceiving because many
parents wait for a spot before they actually
need it, she said. O

Pitt’s center was temporarily placed in

Student groups receive allocations

By Jim Donlon
For Tbe Pitt News

Requests_ for Student

Government Board allocations by _

seven major student groups were
denied or deferred for the fall.
“A deferment is in no way a

penalty. [Student groups] can

bring a deferred request back
any time during the fiscal year,”
said allocations committee chair
Dara Mancini.

“Many times figures are
misleading,” she said.

The student—activities budget is
$600,000, according to Mancini.

The Resident Student
Association asked for $ 19,21 5.37,
and its allocation was cut to
$6,373.99 partly because some of

-and price,

its requests were unspecific,
Mancini said.

Of that original request,
roughly $7,200 was deferred. The
RSA’s request of $1,000 for a live

band at a ‘dance was deferred

because the allocations
committee needed a speciﬁc band
according to
Mancini. _
“Unless we have speciﬁcs, it

would be like just giving them

$1,000 and saying, ‘Do what you
want with it.’ We can’t do that,”
Mancini said. '

The Student Government Board
asked for $93,928.68 and received
$78,606.14, while the Black Action
Society asked for $51,143.96 and
was given $47,140.80.

Mancini suggested that this gap

was smaller only because the
SGB and BAS are more familiar
with allocations guidelines.

“Many times people ask for
what they know they can't get,
such as personal items like T-
shirts and prizes for events. We
can’t give money for that,”
Mancini said.

The University of Pittsburgh
has never overturned a decision
by the allocations committee, said
former allocations committee
chair Henry Charlton.

The money is distributed
according to guidelines set by
the Office of Student Activities
and the Division of Student
Affairs.

The committee, which meets

A anxieties that first-year students

‘face as they begin their university

‘ education were discussed.

But what about the sophomore
year? Can second—year students
anticipate a smooth journey
through the rest of their college
years? Not necessarily! It's true
that in many ways the sophomore
year is easier. ‘

The campus has become
familiar, friendships have been
established and knowledge of
other support services has been
gained.

Nevertheless, a number of
students appear to lose direction

and slip into what is called the

“sophomore slump."

Apathy increases, grades slip
and self-conﬁdence begins to
erode. The challenge of adapting
to a new environment provided a
focus for the first year, but now
pressure to find a focus for one’s
life presents a more demanding '

Struggling to make decisions,
set goals and establish personal
values are common concerns for
college sophomores.

Uncertainty about what major

to choose and what personal
commitments to make can

Apathy, confusion characterize ‘sophomore slump’

immobilize students who believe
that they “should” know what
choices to make and yet'don’t.
Some of these students escape
the resulting feelings of
inadequacy by pretending they
don't care about school or by
throwing themselves headlong
into the party scene. .

Others may get depressed or
develop stress symptoms that
further exacerbate the problem.
Students who ignore some of
these early warning signs may
end up in severe academic
difficulty by mid—year, or they
may lose direction so much that
withdrawing from school could
become an attractive alternative.

Students fare better if they
accept the fact that being
undecided is normal and
expected at this time of life.

Those who anticipate the
uncertainties and view them as
developmentally appropriate are
much less likely to become

immobilized.

They are freer to seek outside
information, more willing to do
an honest self-evaluation, and
they are more tolerant of _ the
decision-making process.

Not knowing where one is
going at this point is not all that
comfortable, but it's not that much
of a problem as long as the
search for answers is not
abandoned.

There are other reasons that
contribute to the drop—off in
performance and the lethargy that
many second—year students
experience.

Most causes of the “slump,”
however, can be successfully
handled by students who are
alert to the early signs and who
are determined to struggle
through it.

For students who are having
trouble resolving these issues on
their own, it is a good idea to get

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has received an
$800,000 grant from the National
Institute of Mental Health to
study children who are afraid to
go to school.

“Typically it starts with a kid
missing a few days of school,
and instead of getting back to
school, it worsens, and they stay
out of school a few days more
until the anxiety increases,” said
Neal Ryan, associate professor

Pittsburgh and head of the
research project.

Children ages 7 to 17 that
have school—related anxieties can
be treated on an outpatient basis
at Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic free of charge.

The treatment involves

behavioral therapy, gradual .

medication.

“You have to have them
rehearse what will happen when
they get back to the school
mentally, practice with the
therapist, drive by the school
and then not stop and finally get

and stay for ﬁve minutes,” Ryan
said.

A list of 19 restrictions prohibits
allocating funds for expenses such
as deficits incurred by an
organization, the purchase of
alcoholic beverages, direct or
indirect donations to political,
religious or service organizations
and off-campus activities that can
be provided for on campus.

The committee also decides if
there is a need for the activity or
program to be funded.

Transportation and convention
procedures can also be restricted.

The Academy of Students of
Pharmacy recently‘ requested
$9,000 for a field trip. That request
included the total price for
transportation.

According to allocations
guidelines, only half of the cost
of ground transportation can be
paid for. This resulted in a $4,500

Allocations also decides if the
program will benefit the
university.

These include the BAS’
Reception for the African
Community or an SGB reception.

The committee also questions
whether the program appeals to
a significant number of people.

“For example, if someone asks
for $1,200 for an event that 25
people are going to attend, we
have to cut it down to
accommodate for that kind of
response,” Mancini said.

They examine whether or not
the money to be spent is worth
what is going to be achieved.
They also consider the timeliness
of the program and the history of
similar activities as well as the
possibility of the program being
redundant.

“If an event comes up in a
hearing and it has been going on
for 10 years‘f*tl1ey usually get the
money they ask for,” Mancini

Fresh h

said.

Since the allocations committee
is a recommending body to the
Student Government Board, any
monies that are to be allocated
above $500 are brought before
the SGB to be voted on. This
makes the allocations committee
and the SGB work in a sort of
check and balance system. Many
times conflicts arise due to this
system.

Within the budget that the
committee controls, there are two
subheadings.

First there is the regular
distribution fund, which is divided
among already ongoing student
groups and programs. The second
fund is the reserve fund. This
fund, which is usually around
$50,000, is reserved for initiating
new programs and activities.

Capital expenditures come from

the reserve fund. Some of these _ _
expenditures T included :*.mone'y<-1

BAS to host minority reception

 

   

By Jim Donlon
For The Pitt News

The Black Action Society will hold a reception.

for the African—American campus community
today from 5 to 7 p.m. in the lower lounge of the
William Pitt Union.

“Since there is a low amount of black faculty
members, it is important for students to get to
know them. There is a oneness that increases the
chances of having someone to talk with that has
similar experiences,” said Marcus Guy, executive
assistant of the BAS. ,

If students have somewhere to go when
-problems arise, there will be a better chance of
them staying at Pitt, Guy said.

Mentors can help students stay in school,
agreed Ricardo Washington, chairperson of Black
Active Students’ Inter-Collegiate Struggle.

“If you get to know people in a casual
atmosphere outside of class, it makes it easier to
talk to them in an educational atmosphere,”
Washington said

The program will begin with an introduction
by BAS President Marta Efﬁnger, followed by a
libation. I

A libation is an ancient African ritual in which
one’s ancestors are recognized and thanked. It
is similar to a prayer and is given before most
BAS programs, according to Guy.

Provost Donald Henderson will also speak at
the reception.

ROTC shifts command

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Command of the Pitt Army
ROTC Panther Battalion was
transferred from the officers to
the cadets in an activation
ceremony last Thursday on the
Cathedral of Learning lawn.

Cadet Lt. Col. Andrew Scott
assumed command from Lt. Col.
Michael Cassetori, following a
tradition started by former
professor of military science
Michael Geoghagan four years
ago.

“It’s a great day to be a soldier,
and it is especially a great day to
be a member of our Panther
battalion,” Cassetori said. “Why?
Because today we have
transferred command of the
Panther battalion, and along with
it a myriad of responsibilities 
In so doing, we, the cadre, have
presented you with an
opportunity.”

Other student officers include
battalion executive officer Ross

 

Scheinbaum and Command Sgt.
Maj. Sharon Debbage.

Scott praised the quality of the
cadet corps and urged new cadets
to become active in the battalion.
He said his goals for the semester
are “to get as much participation
as possible and to have fun.”

“Your task is not an easy one,

butl have absolute conﬁdence in -

your abilities to accomplish your

mission. Make the most of your

opportunity,” Cassetori said.
Scott said ROTC training was

geared toward improving cadets’ '

scores at the training camp they
attend the summer after their
junior year. Physical training and
military
emphasized.
“Traditionally ROTC has been
training [junior cadets] to go to
camp  because that’s what their
commission is based on, ” he said.
The ceremony was also
attended byjerry Voros, a civilian
aide to the secretary of the Army
and chief executive officer of
Ketchum Communications.

said at a press conference held
yesterday.

The review consisted of
meetings with citizens’ groups,

citizens and
government officials, according
to Berkey. He said the survey
included site investigation,
interviews with WTI staff, design
analysis, environmental
regulations and emissions data.
According to the report, both
the design and the toxic air
emissions of WTI’s facility
conform to all applicable

, regulations.

WTI opponents have alleged

that WTI would be capable of
releasing almost half a million
pounds of carbon monoxide into
the air, as well as over 11,000
pounds of lead and mercury.
The report said a controversial
spray-drier system proposed by

(W'l I “will have a beneficial effect

on reducing air emissions" and
urged the approval of a permit
modification that would allow
the implementation of the device.

CHMR’s report was critical of
WTI’s health-risk assessment,
which was said to be “inadequate
by currentstandards. ” In addition,
air-quality impact studies “need
to be better defined by better air

to the report.

WTI opponents have also said
WTI would cause air to stagnate
in the valley, stopping the normal

[determined by a wind-dispersion

consistent with what really
occurs,” said L.]. Kairys, CHMR’s
director of sales and client
services.

“We are confident that the errors

results," Kairys.said.

The ability of WI] and local V

emergency teams to respond to
emergencies also needed
improvement, according to the
report.

“While they met the overall
regulations for emergency
procedures  we felt that some
changes were necessary.”

CHMR’s review cited a
“historical lack of understandable
and reliable information about
the plant” as a cause of public
alarm and urged company and
government officials to establish
and maintain better
communication with the public.

'“We would hope that they’d
seriously consider implementing
the changes suggested in the
report," Kairys‘ said.

While anti-incinerator activist
Paul Connett once referred to
W'I'I’s contracted consultants as
“scientific whores,” Kairys
maintains that WTI’s $20,000
funding of the project had no
effect on CHMR’s objectivity.

“Our mission was to provide
an unconditional third—party
study,” said Kairys, who added
that Ashland Oil funded the
center’s environmental-impact
study after the company’s January
1988 oil spill in Pittsburgh.

Doubts still remain among those
who live near the facility.

“What could you say about
someone who gave you $20,000?
I wouldn’t even bother reading
it,”Joy Allison, a member of SOS,
a grass-roots citizens’ group in
Chester, W.Va., said.

“I can guarantee [the report]

Budget cuts unwise

Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, California
and New York have all been bitten by the ‘bug —— the
budget bug, that is.

These states, along with 24 others, have had their
budgets cut by their state governments, some up to 10
percent. , .

And what does this mean? Lower pay for administrators?
The dissolving of jobs for officials who don’t do their jobs
anyway?

Actually, it means higher tuition.

Once again students are forced to pay for educations
that are hardly worth the price. State University of New
York schools raised their tuition 59 percent to “make up”
for the loss of state monies.

One would think that with the amount of complaining
done about the low intelligence levels of our generation,
states would want to fund schools and help us to attain
a well-rounded education.

Some colleges have decided to decrease library services
and lay off employees. ‘

This, too, only hurts the students.

Students need libraries in which to study for those
credits they pay staggering amounts of money for. Students
need employees of the universities to help them to
understand and pass those courses. What students don’t
need are corrupt administrators who give their schools a
tarnished reputation._

Many other schools also had to say goodbye to federal
funds, thanks to the misspending of research appropriations
by the officials of their respective schools.

Pitt, surprisingly, is not the only school with corrupt
administrators. Stanford University spent almost $200
million in research funding on perks even more outrageous
than Pitt's: $2,000 a month in ﬂowers and $7,000 in linens,
both for the president’s home. MIT misused $731,000, and
the University of Pennsylvania managed to .“spend”
$402,000. ' “

.With federal research funds reduced, universities who

concentrate on development will have to “find” the.

money somewhere else. Rather than decrease the amount
of money spent on services that are useless to students
(i.e. administrators), tuition will be the savior of the
executives once more.

“Many students will be staggering out of school with
$20,000 or more in debts. Students have to make money.
They might like to rebel, but they can’t,‘ they’re in debt to

' pay the bloated salaries of Napoleonic administrators and

do-nothing faculty,” according to Rolling Stone (Oct. 3,
1991).

It is understandable that the country is in an economic
recession, and cutbacks must be drawn from somewhere.
T omorrow’s future, though, should not have to pay for
yesterday’s mistakes.

This is a joke. Here we have Robert Gates, our
president's nominee for head of the Central
Intelligence'Agency, sitting under oath in front of
the Senate Intelligence Committee and suffering
from “Republican Blackout,” a strange phenomena
that forces a three-word, robot—like response of, “I
can’t recall” or “I don’t remember” every time

. , , 

Gates masters I don t remember 
inability to recall important meetings because of the ' 

hurried, hectic atmosphere of the agency, full of V

brief telephone calls andfoot-thick stacks of mernos.

Inman was also quick to point to former CIA boss‘

William Casey, who has become the “dead goat” of
the affair. — if

something important (and
definitely damaging) is brought
forth. And I thought politicians
didn’t take drugs.

What other excuse would Gates
— and going all the way up to
former President Ronald Reagan
— have for not remembering a
meeting or a memo that showed -
activities that were illegal, broke
international law and smashed the
democratic forces that at onetime 
were regarded as a way of doing‘ "A

  I Berger 

“lCasey] made a conscious decision to keep Bob

v Gates out of areas that he thought
might be troublesome to protect
him for the prospect of his future

protecting whom?

While the senators argue
over what should be open for
questioning, Gates is cooly sliding
right past the committee, as they
seem willing to allow a man who,
as deputy director of intelligence

.,:._.=;;$ supposedly had; no
 knﬁvvledgédfanygillegal activities.

business in our government? “Oh,
I know. You see, the reason we can’t remember is
because we had so many other wrongdoings that
week that we just can’t recall which is right and
wrong. Plus Ronnie had some good grass that day.”

Finally, the trial we’ve been waiting for has begun.

Here’s Gates (during last Monday’s opening-

statements) dressed in a conservative blue jacket
and a red tie, looking as stiff as Howdy Doody. He's
sealed as tight as a jar. With a vocal tone reminiscent
of Dan Quayle, he tells the committee what he
“learned in school,” as he read from “personal”
notes that he had written the night before the

_ hearings opened. Gates told the senators that he

had made mistakes in the past, and if confronted
with similar situations (Iran-Contra), he’d be more
skeptical of the information he was receiving and
follow up more extensively. Tough to follow up on
information you can’t seem to recall receiving.

But what should be a grilling of Gates on not only
Iran-Contra but also the “October Surprise” and
arms sales to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war has
turned into a political volleyball match, as Republican
senators quickly jump on the Gates bandwagon
(most notably Sen.—John Warner of Virginia). Warner
has interrupted key questioning from a number of
Democrats on several occasions, and Chairman
David Boren (D-Okla.) has even halted questioning‘
in favor of “national security intelligence.”

So after four days of testimony, what new evidence
has been drummed up? Basically none. On Thursday
Former CIA Latin American Chief Alan Fiers told the
committee that, “The operation was run out of the
White House  I had no reason to think he had great
detail, but I think there was a baseline knowledge.”

The New York 7imes’headline for the next day
read, “Panel is told nominee got early Iran-Contra
warning. ” Then on Friday, a former deputy director

of intelligence, Bobby Ray Inman, excused Gates’s

so the man didn’t know.

Butis that excusable? Is this the man we want to now _
head the damn operatioh, someone who couldn’t_ -

even smell the feces all around him? Some officials
have testifiedthat Gates did know, but he stillcan’t_

progress," I,n'inan said. fﬁhds

recall. So we’ve got the man who didn’t know and —, p 

the man who can’t remember if he knew as the
possible director of intelligence. _

One of the problems with these hearings is the
senators’ willingness to shuffle past Gates’
statements. Many of the senators don’t feel obligated
to grill Gates because of his closeness with members
in the past. As a CIA man, he often shared information
with the committee “with candor,” according to
Sen. Boren. In addition three of the Democratic

senators have had to defend themselves from

involvement in the Keating trial, and Republican

Alphonse D’Amato was recently absolved from an A

ethics scandal. Thus many senators don’t feel the
need to investigate Gates, based on their own
wrongdoings and on Gates’ experience within the
CIA. .
This week’s highlights in testimony include an

intriguing day on Tuesday, as both Charles Allen, ‘

former Latin American chief officer and Richard

Kerr, who is now the CIA’s acting director are _

brought forth for questioning. Allen claims he was
the first to tell Gates of the Contra initiative, but
when that conversation occurred is still questionable.

Gates hid under the “blackout law” by forgetting
that “insigniﬁcant” meeting. On Wednesday the
senators will hold a closed session with Gates dealing

with the Iraq operation as well as whether Gates 0 ‘I

shaped intelligence policy to suit ,White House
strategy. « ~
Let’s hope he remembers to show up.

Men’s tennis
ﬁnishes last
in Big East

tournament

By Bob Maselli
Staff Wﬁter

The Panther tennis team
traveled to Weekapaug, R. 1., this
past weekend for the Big East
Championships and came home
with results that were less than
impressive.

Pitt not only came in last place
out of nine teams, but it only won
one set, and their No. 1 singles
player spent a day in the hospital
due to food poisoning. Eric
Weaver spent Friday afternoon
and evening in the hospital after
having stomach problems, thus
defaulting two singles matches
and one doubles match.

“It just creptu p on me,” Weaver
said. “I ate some fast food, and
after my doubles match, I started
to feel really sick.”

The Panthers’ lone set victory
came when Joel Orth won a set
against Miami’s Rich Cowell in a
singles consolation quarterfinals
match. Cowell ultimately won
the match 6-2, (3-6), 6-0, but Orth
was happy with his
accomplishment.

“I was really happy to win that
set because it was against
someone from Miami,” Orth said.
“We aren’t going to meet them

again this season, and I wanted
See Tennis, page 12

The Irish Peacock, interr1ation.al hoop woes and supersaints 

It’s amazing what a weekend of failed
football predictions and an abundance of
poor television analysts will do to a writer.
In fact, I'm still irate that I had to miss
Saturday night’s Washington-Nebraska
showdown so ABC could show Penn State
practically dismember Ty Detmer and his
overexposed _BYU Cougars. Here are a
few thoughts from the weekend:

-Why did NBC go out of its way before
the season to tell us that its “Notre Dame
Network” telecasts would be objective
and not one—sided? This is an absolute
joke. After seeing the Notre Dame-Indiana

' game a couple weeks ago and suffering

through Notre Dame-Michigan State on
Saturday, ‘I felt like murdering every NBC
executive. I can only take so many shots
of the hallowed Golden Dome and.the
obnoxious Irish students.

If you don’t have any feelings one way
or the other toward the Irish, just watch
these games and I guarantee you’ll hate
them in less than a quarter. Why must Dick
Enberg and Bill Walsh insist on being so
biased? I used to respect Enberg, but he
has totally lost credibility with his “rah-
rah” cheerleading for the Irish.

Walsh is even worse than Enberg. He
needs to find a clue really fast. Where does
he pull out these inane statements like,
“Rick Mirer is the finest quarterback in the
nation." Yeah, right. And Jay Schroeder’s
going to the Pro Bowl this year. Did Walsh
ever hear of Casey Weldon, Shane
Matthews, Alex Van Pelt or Elvis Grbac?
Notre Dame is a solid football team, nothing
more and nothing less. They'll probably
win eight‘ games. But they are not the

Rob
Pugliese

powerhouse they were two or three years
ago. Their defense is nothing more than
adequate, and when their offensive line
meets a tough defensive front, like
Michigan’s last week or the Tennessee
Vols’ down the road, they can be shut
down. If Walsh wants to see a real
quarterback, he’ll have ample opportunity
with both Van Pelt and T ennessee’s Andy
Kelly due to visit dungeon-like Notre
Dame Stadium in the upcoming weeks.
-Now that the U.S. Olympic Basketball
Team has officially been announced, I’d
just like to say it’s long overdue that the
pros play. The Soviets and Yugoslavs have
won gold medals against weak American
squads for seven years now, and retribution
will come in Barcelona. The Goodwill
Games in ’9O was the best example. We
sent a team with a nucleus of Kenny
Anderson, .T odd Day, Christian Laettner,
Billy Owens, Doug Smith and Alonzo
Mourning. That's all fine and well. But
imagine if Larry Johnson, Stacey Au gmon,
Shaquille O’Neal and Steve Smith were
part of the U.S. club. Granted, many of
these players have declined to tryout for

the Pan American and Goodwill squads or _

have withdrawn due to injuries, but it
doesn’t take a genius to see that our
methods have been lacking as much as
our amateur talent. It is just not possible to

 

Eric Weaver was forced to retire from ' last weekend's Big East Championships because of illness.

build a true national team with college
players.

-I hear cynics saying, “Big deal if the
pros play; there won’t be any competition. ”
Precisely the point. Basketball is America’s
game, and it’s about time that we show the
world the most destructive squad ever
assembled. The international rules will do
nothing but help the U.S. Charles Barkley
is the ideal intefnational player. The wider
lane is tailor-made for his game, and with
Karl Malone at power forward, Barkley
will be playing small forward. The
opposition has never-seen anyone that
approaches Barkley in terms of
explosiveness or power. As dominant as
he is in the States, he’ll be even scarier
with these rules. The international three-
point line is nothing more than a layup for
Chris Mullin. So much for defensing the
Americans with a zone. The modiﬁed
goaltending rules will make Patrick Ewing
and David Robinson look like Bill Russell
inside.

-With 10 spots filled, the committee will
select two more players next spring to
complete the roster. One collegiate player
may be added, possibly O’Neal, Laettner
or Ohio State's Jimmy Jackson. Possible
pro candidates for the ﬁnal spots include
Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter, Kevinjohnson,
Torn Chambers, Dominique Wilkins, Isaiah
Thomas, Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman.
Here’s a vote for Drexler and Rodman.
Why? Because Drexler is just too amazing
to leave home, and Rodman is the best
defender in the world. His intensity and
work ethic are valuable to any team. If we
happen to face Brazil, with sharpshooter

Pete Rondinelli/The Pitt News I-

Oscar Schmidt, then Rodman is the only
man to guard him.

0 For those of you who believe the hype
and actually think that Yugoslavia has a A
prayer against this club, let's have a reality
check. OK, they have a 6-foot, 10-inch
guard, Toni Kukoc, who has been called
“the left-handed Magic Johnson." Good
for him; we have Magic. They have -

“sharpshooter Drazen Petrovic, who also

toils for the New Jersey Nets. A .
Yes, Petrovic is a great player, but a
Mullin or a Drexler he’s not. Dino Radja is
a solid power forward who has done
serious damage in‘ every international
tournament, but he has never been
slammed on by Malone or Barkley. And
oh, yes, L.A. Lakers center Vlade Divac
will be there, too. Divac has earned respect -
throughout the league and proven himself _
a future all-star, but remember he is the
fifth- or sixth—best center in the NBA. The ’
two best are playing for the U.S. Divac is
helpless against Ewing or Robinson. We
don’t even need to discuss the
consequences for the Yugoslavs when
they have to go to their bench. So why

don’t all these critics and cynics just shut “‘
up and enjoy this U.S. team. You’ll be ‘

seeing at least nine future members of the I
NBA Hall Of Fame, possibly more. You '
may never see anything like it in your
lifetime.

-A quick thought on the NFL. The‘ ‘

Giants had better replace Jeff Hostetler
with Phil Simms fast, or theycan kiss the
playoffs goodbye. Yes, New Orleans is for
real. The NFC East could have four playoff
teams this year. ‘ '

OK, here's the scene. You get up

"5 _ unusually early for a Saturday, hit the

’ shower with a bogus hangover and get

. dressed. You leave your apartment (or

dorm room) and make your way to Pitt
Stadium to watch the Panthers play this
week’s opponent.

You get into the stadium, make some
conversation with your friends about the
events ahead, and the band begins to play.
After the national anthem is finished, as

well as the Pitt alma mater, you sit down.

runway, ready to come onto the ﬁeld of

Yep, you guessed it. Mr. Microphone

an ‘I.’ Give me a ‘T.’ Give me another ‘T.’
What’s it spell?”

For this fan, it spells asinine.

Do we really need this man doing this?
For that matter, do we really need
cheerleaders?

Now when I was an immature first-year
student, I would answer “yes” to this

question for obvious reasons. The main
factor would be the same one that most
men have about seeing a leggy young
woman in a short skirt. I couldn’t help it.
It’s nature.

But in this day and age, when I am a
mature, intelligent, reasonable senior, I
must say that the cheerleaders are virtually
useless. What are their main objectives?
What are they trying to do out there that

to play them before I graduated.”

Pitt went into the tournament
with a 3-0 mark but was still in
the process of getting its lineup in
order, so it wasn’t ready for the
tough draws that awaited the
team. Players were matched up
by seedings, and whichever two
names were chosen from a hat,
those men played each other.

“We had some tough draws,

7 but we didn’t expect to play as

badly as we did,” Weaver said.

“We went up this year with the
same team as we did\last year,
and the results were A much
different. We finished in sixth
place. It wasn’t anything that
wasn’t expected, but we didn’t
think it was going to be this bad,”
he said.

Although the Panthers. didn’t
win a match, some players put in
good efforts but came up short.
Larry Garrard lost tojames Ribman
of Georgetown 6-3, 6-3 in a first-
round singles match, and Orth

lost a tough match to Seton Hall’s
Chris Lawrence 6-4, 6-1.

John Tegano lost to Ellison
Cruz of St. _Iohn’s 6-3, 6-3 in a
quarterfinal match, and in the
consolation semifinals Tegano
lost a stopper to Villanova’s Bryan
Cavalier 6-4, 7-5. In another
quarterﬁnal match, Scott Smith
lost to Dan Glazer of Connecticut
6-3, 6-3.

In doubles action, David Ginder
and James Chronister lost to Neil
Glavara and Tom Maffeo of
Boston College ..6—4, 6-4 in a
consolation semiﬁnals match-

Other matches were played,
but the story was basically the
same. .

The conference tournament
was won by St. John’s with 47
points, while Providence came in
second with 45, and Miami placed
third with 43 points. The rest are
as follows: Georgetown, 34;
Boston College, 32; Seton Hall,

The Daily Illini
University of Illinois

The university is awaiting a
decision from the governor
concerning the banning of the
ROTC.

Last year the university took
action to have the ROTC removed

discriminate against homosexual
students.

Since then a bill has been passed
in the state senate and house of
representatives to block this
action.

The governor may either sign
the bill into law or veto it.

Care
Continued from page 1

Belleﬁeld Annex seven years ago.

“We have been looking actively
for two years for alternative
locations,” saidjohn Yeager, vice
pres‘ident of administration.

Yeager said it’s hard to ﬁnd a
space on campus that is large
enough to accommodate 150
children.

Finances are also a problem,
he said.

“It’s a problem we have to

address. I just don’t know what’

the solution is at this moment,”
Yeager said. E

Other organizations on campus
are also actively looking for
solutions to the child-care
problem.

At their first meeting yesterday,
the Provost’s Advisory Committee
on Women's Concerns decided
to have a’ special committee
research the need and possibilities
for child care at Pitt.

Committee chair Georginen

Materniak said, “[Our goal] is to
conduct fact—f1nding and data-
gathering [studies] about child

care and family issues of the Pitt

community.”

According to Materniak, the
committee will be evaluating the
need for pre—schoo1 child care in
actual numbers as well as possible
care for school—aged children and
summer care. The committee
will also be exploring care, for

elderly parents and relatives that

   

V ,dent_s..may be responsible ‘for.
_ _,.,-Materniak said there is no easy
solutionto the cost of child care,
but parents need to know that
their children are safe.

PACWC has no power to initiate
any change in the system and can
only “illustrate how much of a
need is out there and recommend
to administration that they do
more detailed studies . for a
possible solution for more child
care,” Materniak said.

The PACWC committee is
working with CCCP to help
facilitate the information-
gathering process.

 

    
  

  

      
     

 

Shorr said the CCCP has

1 recently completed a proposal it
intends to send to Pitt President].

Dennis O’Connor. The proposal
outlines five points they feel are
necessary changes to the current
child-care system at Pitt. It
requests that: -

I-O’Connor make a policy

statement acknowledging that
better day care comes under
affirmative action.

’ According to Shorr, child care
can be considered an affirmative-
action program because it affects
the numbers of women enrolling
and staying at the university.
-the university furnish child care
that has more ﬂexible hours and
part-time care. I
- the university expand the child-
care center .

-the university create a sliding
scale for prices, depending on
how many children per family
attend the center and the family’s
income.

Shorr said a sliding scale is .

extremely important in making
the childcare facility affordable
for all faculty, staff and students.
-CCCP be represented on the
university’s commission on
building space. Shorr said CCCP
wants to make sure that a site for
a new center is actively pursued‘

, year round.

The Parents Advisory Group in
the past asked that the university
forgive the center of its $20,000 a

. year rent to reduce the price
infcreavse. from 10 percentto 5 _

percent, said Diane Saylor,
assistant director of the office of
special accounts and a member
of the Parents Advisory Group.
PAG is made up of parents whose
children are enrolled in Pitt’s day-
care center.

The university denied the
request, but according to Saylor,
Yeager’s office did respond to
their needs and began to direct

more attention to a future site, '

more university funding for the
center and a ‘~ possible
kindergarten.
