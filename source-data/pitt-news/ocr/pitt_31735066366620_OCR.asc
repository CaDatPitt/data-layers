3 Trimester

4 Despite severe criticism H from
g the Ford Foundation Report, the
y UniVersity’s trimester system is
not in any danger of being term-
inated, according to Jack R.
Critchﬁeld, director of admis-
sions and student aid.

“I doubt that the trimester sys-
tem will be scrapped,” said Critch-
, ﬁeld. “What may hapen is that
1‘ the length of the trimesters may
3*“, be changed so that the academic
1- ' year will end sometime in the

middle of the year. If the system

.. ._,-....» ~ 4.?-'

is changed, it will be after addi- I

3 tiorial thought and experimenta-
'. tion.

E The Ford Report cited the great
‘ expense of maintaining the third
trimester at a highly reduced en-
rollment as a cause for the un-

__ favorable ﬁnancial situation.
' Critchﬁeld commented, however,
l that “if the cost is reduced sig-
$.‘\ niﬁcantly to students, the only
~"’ legitimate criticism disappears.

‘~; The major reason for the low
enrollment during the spring
term is‘ the cost factor.” 1,

There will be an open house
tomorrow in the Men’s Dormi-
tories from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. The
Women's Dormitories will hold
an open house Sunday from 2 to
4 p.m.

John Smith, Winter Weekend
chairman, said that “I hope that
all University students will take
the opportunity to see the tal-
ent they have been asking for.
Winter Weekend has the largest
allocation ever of any activity at
the University and I would hope
that the students would support
it. The success of Winter Week-
end would increase the possib-
ility of future big name enter-
tainment at Pitt.

1965-66 at its meeting Tues-
day night. At the same time,

British Novelist Wilson
Speaks at Midday Series

' British literary figure, Colin Wilson, will speak at noon
Wednesday in the Student Union Ballroom. He will lecture
on “The Revolution in Literature’ ’ in the Midday Series spon-
sored by the Student Union Board.

Wilson has been labeled as innovator, iconoclast, philos-
opher, critic, and novelist. His first book, The Outsider, is

a criticism of modern civilization.
It is the ﬁrst of a series of books
called the Outsider Cycle, the
most recent of which has been
Beyond the Outsider: the Phil-
osophy of the Future.

Sometimes called “The Elder
Statesman of the Angry Young
Men” and “The British Dostoyev-
sky,” Wilson has been described
by a French critic as “the only
worthy successor to Orwell, D.
H. Lawrence and Aldous Huxley
that England has produced.”

He has published ﬁve novels,
an autobiography, Voyage to a Be-
ginning, and a book of music cri-
ticism, The Brandy of the Dartm-
ed, in addition to his philosophic-

al Works. His books’ have been

translated into 15 languages.

Wilson was recently appointed
Writer in Residence at St. John’s
College, Annapolis.

Born in Leicester, England, in
1931, Wilson left school at 16 to
continue his education in class-
rooms of his own choosing. Af-
ter reading the poetry of T. S.
Eliot, his interests switched from
scientiﬁc to literary. _ ‘

COLIN WILSON
S U Speaker
He began to write plays, short

stories, essays and poetry. He

was on the staff of The Paris Re-

view until the summer of 1954

when he took a night job and sat

in the British Museum and wrote
The Outsider.

Coffee Hour Discusses

Project Questionnaire

By VICKI EPSTEIN

The University community had
a chance to evaluate the Project
Teach progr and questionnaire
at a coffee hour held Tuesday by
Dr. Kenneth W. Cummins, assis-
tant professor of biology.

Criticism expressed at the cof-
fee hour centered around stuffing
the questionnaire boxes and sin-
cere answering of the question-
naire, according to Allan Gug-
genheim, chairman of the Proj-
ect Teach questionnaire commit-
tee.

Roughly 1,300 or 1,400» ques-
tionnaires coming from some 400
students were received by Proj-
ject Teach. Guggenheim believes
that questionnaire collection box-
es cannot be stuffed because ques-
tionnaries taken from the boxes
at the same time with the same
answers are stapled together and
considered for validity. “We think
we’ve caught most of the stuf-
ﬁng,” Guggenheim said. ‘

All responses come from, what
Guggenheim considers, “people
who have an opinion”; this opin-

Opportunity comes early at Ford Motor Company.
Graduates who join us are often surprised at how
quickly they receive personal assignments involv-
ing major responsibilities. This chance to dem-
onstrate individual skills contrasts sharply with
the experience of many young people entering the
business world for the first time. At Ford Motor
Company, for example, a graduate may initiate a
project and carry it through to its ﬁnal develop-
ment. One who knows is David Tenniswood, of

_ Dave joined Ford Motor Company in July, 1961.
Assigned to our steering and controls section, he helped develop a revolu-
tionary steering system .that will facilitate driving in future Ford-built cars.
Currently a design engineer working on suspension design and analysis,
Dave has been impressed by the extent to which management encourages
personal initiative among recent graduates like himself. Here, management

‘ looks immediately to young engineers, like Dave, for fresh concepts that
reﬂect their academic training and special abilities. Moreover, when the
idea is accepted for developnient, the initiator is frequently given the
opportunity to see the job through-—from drawing board to production line!

The experience of Dave Tenniswood is not unusual. Ford Motor Company
believes that early incentive is fundamental to individual ‘growth and a

The John Birch Society is
the most active proponent of
the far-right ideal in Ameri-
ca‘ today. Many people think
the Society ludicrous, yet it
cannot be denied that it is
composed of prosperous, in-
telligent middle- class peo-
ple — people who to be as
successful as they have been

tions, abroad. Finally there
is the problem of the poten-
tially powerful underdevelop-
ed nations which are begin-
ning to threaten our ideas
of the omnipotence of the
United -States. Who would
have thought 20 years ago
that China could have
evolved into the threat to us
» that it now seems to be?

Taken as a whole, the phil-
osophy of the John Birch So-
ciety is truly one of reaction
-—not j ust_a reaction against
Communism, but a reaction
against anything that is new
and threatening. It is inter-
esting to read the kind of ex-
planation that members give
to explain their decision to
join the Society. “The John
Birch Society: A Report”
quotes one woman as saying,
“For some time I had been
growing more and more con-
cerned with the Way in which
our nation seemed to be head-
ing and as to what kind of
future my children might ex-
pect. When the John Birch
Society was presented to me
I knew at once that this was
what I had been looking for."

THE IMPORTANT thing
here is that before they join
the members are not always
consciously and explicity
worried about Communism,
but feel what most describe

should be more rational than
their politics would indicate.
I attended a “Freedom For-
um,” a lecture series spon-
sored by the Society, to see

tent facts.
. A PREVALENT concep-

literature is its hatred of the

what I saw at the Forum,
however, would lead me to
believe that this picture of

tributed too much impor-

take into account their fears

This hatred of the new “concern.” In this sense I
think that Communism is
really the personification of
all the fears of these people;
that somewhere in the backs
of their minds, all of their
hatreds and all of their prej-
udices have coalesced to form
this one great symbol of
evil: Communism. These peo-
ple are ‘the emotional vic-
tims bf the cold war, the H-
Bomb, automation, socialism,
and so much more. And this
fear, this horrid dread of
an even more awful future
they have chosen to call
Communism is a Communist
plot. It is just one more of
those forces, albeit the most
threatenlflg. that emanate
from their basic complex of
fears. .

Instead of complaining and developing fears based on incomplete.
knowledge,’ students should voice their opinions through a legal channel.
Student Government (SG) should organize a study group to consider the
merits of the alternative academic calendars (quarter, trimester, semester)
and the Ford concept of state aid.

After the committee evaluates the report, the pros and cons should
be presented to the students and a referendum held to gauge student opin-
ion on the matter. Then the opinion of the student body should be ex-
pressed to those in the heirarchy making the final decision.

Students should pressure SG by talking to individual senators. Stu-

- dents should write letters to SG and the paper expressing a student con-
cern. Students should organize through one central unit and analyze the
Ford report's views on key issues. ,

The topic of a new state affiliation with lower tuition and increased
enrollment is the primary issue in the program of every administrator at
the University. The image of the University hinges on it; the choice of a
new chancellor depends on it; and the academic future of the school and
community pivot around the issue presented in the Ford report.

Students need not flood thepublic relations office and ask for the

Ford report, nor bother professors and administrators trying to sooth their

apprehensions about a new state status. In essence, unorganized efforts
will result in mayhem and any student opinion expressed this ‘way. will be
meaningless.

No definite conclusions need be reached, but student opinion must be
expressed. If the students do not undertake this effort, no one else will
seek their advice. It is their opportunity and obligation to let the Uni-
versity’s decision-makers know there exists a signiﬁcant student View on

the crucial issuesof the Ford report.

The John Birch in Us

by Hobart Harris

the product of the cultural
milieu of our times. The
members are people who
through some unfortunate
combination of circumstances
have succumbed to the
threats that we believe we
are still facing rationally.
But are we?

JUST BY existing in this
decade we must face them,

and we have the same pre-

conceptions about our his-
tory, our government, and es-
pecially “the American Way
of -life that they do.”

How many of our conver-
sations have ended with ab-
solutes like, “They.’re Com-

\ munists aren’t they?” How

many of us can turn our
backs on the hundreds of
civilians who sometimes die
in napalm attacks on their
homes in Vietnam with the
excuse that if they weren’t
Communists they wouldn’t
be living in Viet Cong-con-
trolled villages? We, just as
the members of the John
Birch Society, face the pres-
sures that drove them over
the line, and a close examin-
ation of our own attitudes
suggests that there is a lit-
tle more John Birch in each
of us than we would perhaps
like to recognize.

  A Woman In Power
I ' by Marsha Rehns

The fate of the second‘ most populous nation in the
world has been placed in the hands of a 48 year-old woman.
The administration of Mrs. Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister
of India begins in the midst of an uneasy peace with Pakis-
tan and domestic riots, anticipating an inevitable famine,
yet there is confidence she can serve well. W

The election of a woman as Prime Minis-
ter by a two-to-one margin over a male can-
didate seems all the more surprising in a
. country in which women are suppressed by

. religious convention. No doubt part of Mrs.
Gandhi’s' popularity was a result of- being the
daughter of the late Prime Minister Nehru,
but she is not working on her father's repu-
tation alone.

 _v SHE LEARNED politics from her father,
M138  aiding him when India was under British
rule, divorcing her husbandto run the prime minister's man-

. ‘sion and eventually becoming president of ‘ the Congress

Party, India’s leading political organization. ‘

It is difficult to prophesy the kind of leader Mrs.
Gandhi will become. She may follow her father's policy of
non-alignment, gaining aid from both East and West or
with the Communists on her border she may draw closer
to one side. '

At any rate, her electors had to feel she was capable of
carrying on without Nehru or Prime Minister Shastri, whom
she succeeded. With a reputation as an effective adminis-
trator with a strong mind of her own and a sharp temper
(according to the New York Times) her sex had little bear-
ing on her election.

HER ACHIEVEMENT as a woman has been unequaled’
in the West. Mrs. Gandhi, who claims.not to be .“a feminist
but a human being,” is in a position to prove that women

are as capable of holding the world’s highest positions as I
' are men. She will deal with the military, with male diplo-

mats, and with her own people. If she has the ability to ana-
lyze and make decisions, the wisdom to take advice and at

the same time express her won opinion, and a firm commit-

ment of India and her own ideals, no man can better her
nor be more worthy of the respect of other men or women.

   
    
  
   
    
   
 
  
    
  
   
  
 
 
  
   
   
  
 

The same criteria apply to any woman in any position I

anywhere in the world. An intelligent woman, trained in
critical judgment will not be driven by emotions. With the
necessary ability, she can complete any job and face its
problems with the same exactitude as men. The appoint-
ment of Mrs. Gandhi should serve as an example to the West
in its acceptance of women. The new Prime Minister will
affect the fate not only of India but of the status of women
all over the World.

World War II was an exciting
period in history for all kinds of
good guys. While Gregory Peck
and Anthony Quinn were mas-
terminding the demolition of The
Guns of Navarone, Burt Lancas-
ter was busy stopping the Nazis
from destroying hundreds of val-
uable paintings inside The Train.
Meanwhile, Julie Andrews and
Christopher Plummer were us-
ing the Sound of Music to help
the trapped Trapp family éscape
the Nazis and climb every moun-
tain.

Kirk Douglas, however, was
in Norway. He and Richard Har-
ris were given the risky assign-
ment of sabotaging the Germans’
Norsk Hydro plant, which pro-
duced “heavy water” for use in
atomic experiments. With this
accomplished, the Nazis would
have little hope of developing the
atomic bomb, and Kirk and Rich-
ard could proudly and undeni-
ably declare themselves The Be-
roes of Telemark.

But this piece de la resistance
movement tends to obscure the

' behind-the-front-lines work of an-

other set of heroes -— the real

is obvious that if every sugges-

tion in the manual were car-'

ried out, the results would not
coincidentally resemble the ac-
tual World War 11 battle of Tele-
mark. * 2
Since the seizure of the hydro
plant was the work of nine men
(Kirk and Richard plus seven

- others), you could “have a local

newspaper ﬁnd nine heroes and
heroines in your area and appro-
priately honor them.”.These
might «include “members of your

Game Loss ‘Skein

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Fordham gym in New York
City isn’t the ideal place for
the Pant-her basketball team
to snap their four game los-
ing streak. Regardless of
their won-lost record (6-9),
the Rams play like NCAA cham-
pions when they're spurred on
by the home crowd.

Tomorrow night some 3,000
Fordham students will spend a
basketball evening watching to

see which factor will win out.

Will Fordham win another home
contest or will the, hoopsters
bounce back with a victory?

The answer could possibly be
the latter. The Panthers have had
five days to prepare for the game.
The last time the cagers had a
full week off before a game was
two ‘weeks ago against Penn
State. It was then that they play-
ed their best game of the season,
losing in the last seconds of play,
66-62.

Stan Falenski provided the Pan-
ther quintet some scoring punch
in that Penn State aﬂair. But
he has been out of the lineup re-
cently with ligament trouble in
his knee. According to coach Bob
Timmons, Falenski will deﬁnite-
ly play Saturday.

“He’s been-.nmning on the bad
leg all week,” Timmons said. If
Falenski can return to full form
by tomorrow, it's another‘ plus
for the cagers. He’s one of the
more. reliable shooters on the
team, hitting about 45 per cent
of his shots.

The hocpsters will need" allthe

outside shooting they can muster
to crack Fordham’s zone defense.
“They play the zone consistent-
ly,” said Timmons. “Last year it
was used by Johnny Bach (the
Ram coach) on‘ and on. This sea-
son he has gone to it all the

time.” \

Penn State. was the last team
the cagers played that employed
the zone. By working the ball
to the open man and by hitting
regularly -from the outside, the
hoopsters wrecked the eﬂective-
ness of the Lions‘ zone.

In addition to Fa1enski’s abil-
ity to score against a zone de-
fense, Timmons will depend on
Roth McNally’s capacity to do
the same damage. McNally, who
hasn't seen too much action this
year, ‘ﬁgures to spell Falenski to-
morrow. *

“McNally shoots better against

eralovich and when he starts hit-
ting he can hurt the other ball
club.” Generalovich, incidentally,
has taken 11 shots in ﬁve ball
games and has made one.

“Fordham’s a fairly good ball
club,” Timmons continued.
They're a good ballhandling team,
moving the ball a lot and shoot-
ing pretty well,

“They won't have a height ad-
vantage over us, so we can stay
with our man to man defense,”
he added. “Their biggest men
are Len Zandy and Joe Frangi-
pane, both 6-6. They're seniors as
is their captain, Bruce Brodbeck.
Brodbeck is the team’s play-
maker.” _

Zandy averages about 16 points

a game and Frangipane hits for
12. But the most pleasant sur-
price for Fordham has been the
play of their 6-3 sophomore for-
ward Bill ‘Langheld. This New
Jersey boy is averaging 16 points
a game.
A Probably the main reason for
Fordham’s disappointing 6-,9 rec-
ord has been the loss of three
very important starters. “We lost
too much when Johnny Stevens,
Wayne McGuirt, and Mike Fitz-
gerald graduated," Bech said.
“That's 1,000 points and 500 ro-
boundsaseasonthathastobe
replaced.” .

The hoopsters have also lost
an important starter, thought not
through graduation. Ken Bollens
may be. out for the’ season. His
right knee is still swollen from
the ligament tear he suffered in
a mid-court collision at Penn
State.

end again. _

“Both meets are toughies,”

scored eight more ﬁeld goals, but
Point Park scored on 17 more
foul shots.

It was just a missed layup here
and a missed free throw there that
was the difference‘. “If we could

’make a layup, I'm afraid of what
we'd do to some teams,” com-
mented coach Tim Grgurich.

In the four game'streak, _the
freshmen have toppled Johns-
town, 101-75; West Virginia, 85-
75; Indiana, .87-71; and Youngs-
town. The oﬁense is moving well,
except for one cold streak in the
last ﬁve minutes against Youngs-
town,- and the scoring is bal-
anced.

they go at the Orange of Syracuse.

Grady said. “The relays should.

be about even with the winner
being the one who gets his hand
out (at the ﬁnish) ﬁrst.”

Colgate, the ﬁrst team that
could give the swimmers color
blindness, is led by two senior
freestylers. Richard Arluck, from
Brooklyn, swims the 500—yard
freestyle, holding his school's rec-
ord. Another New Yorker, Dave_
Martin swims the sprints.

Sprint freestyler Richard Bans-
chard remedies a major part of
Syracuse coach Jon Buzzard’s
problems. Bauschard swims the
50 and 100-yarder besides anchor-
ing the 400-yard freestyle.

In his ﬁrst year of coaching,

Cubs Find Rematch On Weekend Card

Clements have been doing an ex-
cellent job getting the ball to the
big men underneath; and Al Di-
Frischia, Sylvestor Stevenson, and
Len Kalata are rebounding
against taller opposition as well
as scoring.

“They do it all themselves,”
said Grgurich. “All I do is sit
back and watch.” He is very high
on his team and feels that. at
least eight of his boys could
make the varsity next year.
“They’re still young and care-
less, but they have improved.” .

The honeymoon is not over
yet, the squad still has eight
more games, including two with
the Duquesne fresh. - -  '-

  

Buzzard also depends on sopho-
more John King and senior John
DeYoung in the freestyle events.
Dennis Engel takes’ care of the
diving while Ed Branigan swims
in the backstroke. 

In the home meet against Mi-

ami last week, sophomore swim-
mers swiped four of the mermen’s

"seven individual ﬁrsts: Grady says-

his sophomores are coming along,
but he never overlooks the old
guard.

“(John) Lane holds down the

200 yard freestyle and this al-

lows me to _use Gary Martin to
plug the holes in the dam,”

.  Wrest ers Face
Matmen Defeated, 18 - 1.7;

By Cornell Yesterday

By TOM SACKS, Assistant sports Editor
The wrestling team, which made it through the snow in
time to lose to Cornell, 18-17, here yesterday, heads back on
the road tomorrow for Michigan. The weather reports are
favorable this time, but the environment isn't.
- Michigan, the defending Big Ten champion, has won 37
dual meets in a row. Three of the Wolverines’ five Big Ten

title-holders are back from last
year's squad, which defeated the
matmen, 21-11.

Bob Fehrs, their 123 pound cham-
pion, will be matched up with
Tony Liberati. Ron Schuchert
will be paired with Bill Johannes-
en, ‘the Big Ten’s. 130 pound
champion. Clair Riley will most
likely face their other title hold-
er, Jim Kammen, at 160.

In the Cornell meet, the wres-
tlers had jumped into a 15-7 lead
at the end of - the ﬁrst six match-
es, but in the remaining four
pairings they could salvage only
one draw.

The Big Red opened up with a
three point lead when Bob Stock:
decisioned Tony Liberati, 3-2, in
the 123 pound class. In the next
match, Dick Shildt appeared to
have the jump on his opponent,
Dick Beck, throughout the whole
match but had to settle in, the
end with a 1-1 draw.

“Right now Shildt doesn’t have
the strength to wrestle at 123,
but that's his proper weight
class," said coach Dave Johnson.
“He doesn’t have the size for 130
and V it puts him at a disadvan-
tage.” .

Ron Schuchert picked up a

quick ﬁve points at 137 when-
Cornell forfeited.

The best match of the day
came at 145 where Dino Boni de-
cisioned Don New, 8-5. Boni was
given two points for a takedown
in the ﬁrst period and appeared
to be on his way to an easy vic-
tory when New pulled a reversal
in the second period, drawing

-within one point. But Boni then

switched positions-with New and
held onpin the closing period.
New had beaten Boni last year,
7-1, in the dual meet at Ithaca.

In the 152 pound division-, Jim
Rhone was trailing 1-0 going into
the third period. He managed a
quick escape, followed up with
a takedown and was awarded
two minutes riding time to give
the wrestlers another three points.

Gaining momentum after Jeff
Stephens’ 8-0 win over Tim Trax,
Cornell narrowed the score to
17-15 going into the heavyweight
match. Terry Hoover nearly had
a takedown in the ﬁrst period
when the buzzer sounded.‘ Big
Red's heavyweight, Dick Moore,
then came back strong‘ in the
next period with three points for
a near fall, winning eventually
6-1. ’

Panthers Meet Cadets Indoors
In Track  Meet at West Point

Coach Carl Rees’s track
team should be glad they had
the easy win over Slippery
Rock last Saturday as a
breather. The Panthers meet
the West Point cadets at
West Point this Saturday, and to
beat the Black Knights in their
own ﬁeld house is a near impos-
sibility. ‘

The Panthers looked impres-

sive against Slippery Roek as
they evened their record at one
win and one loss, over powering
the Rockets 57 to 34. They swept
the mile run and shot put with
Don Hinchberger and Jim Flani-
gan winning those events, re
spectively.

DINO BONI holds on to Cornell's Don New in the

   

second period of yesterday’s match. New eventual-
ly broke the hold, but Boni came right back with

Army Promises Tight Duel
In Gymnastics Meet Saturday

The gymnasts play. host

. tomorrow to a strong Army

team at Trees Hall gym that
has been defeated only twice
this year. The Army squad

has lost to Springfield and
Penn State, two of the top teams
in the country. Penn State, the
best gymnastic squad in the coun-
try last year, beat Army by the
small margin of 180-171.

The outlook for a Panther vic-
tory over Anny is dim. The gym-
nasts best score this season was
a 157 against Kent State last Sat-
urday. The Panthers with a rec-
ord of 3-4 have also been defeat-
ed by Penn State and Spring-

Pitt‘ has three remaining gym-

pects of winning these meets, ac-
cording to Dave McKinnis, cap-
vtain of the squad, “Penn State

and Springﬁeld were way above
us and Kent State and Georgia
Tech were below us. These teams
are on an even par with us. The
meets should be real close.”

The next home gymnastic meet
will be three weeks from Satur-
