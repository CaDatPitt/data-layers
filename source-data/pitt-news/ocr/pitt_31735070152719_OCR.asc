‘The Student Government Board has selected

two new members to ﬁll the vacancies left

vice president of Beta Theta Pi, said students

off campus could ﬁll out an online form that

West said the submission of the event

SAE abolishes pledging process in favor of ‘true gentleman experience’

Lauren Rosenblatt
Staff Wrz'ter

On its 158th birthday, March 9, 2014, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, a social fraternity, decided to
return to its roots by eliminating its pledg-
ing process.

According to Brandon Weghorst, associ-
ate executive director of communications
for Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s national organiza-
tion, the board of directors made this deci-
sion out of respect for its founding fathers.

Weghorst said there was no particular
incident that led to the decision, rather, it
came as a result of a couple of different fac-
tors that he preferred to not convey.

According to a report from Bloomberg
on Dec. 30, 2013, in the past three years,
colleges have suspended or closed at least
15 Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapters. Nationally,
the fraternity has had nine deaths related
to drinking, drugs and hazing since 2006,
more than any other Greek organization.

Brendan McEwen, president of Pitt’s
Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, declined to

comment on the changes, saying that they
were an internal matter.

Weghorst explained that the elimination
of the pledging process would bring about
positive changes to the fraternity.

“We’re improving the membership ex-
perience for undergraduates, keeping it
consistent with what Sigma Alpha'Epsilon
is all about. We’re going back to what the
membership experience used to be like,”
Weghorst said. _

According to a document extended from
apress release on Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s
national website, the fraternity did not
originally have a pledging process.

“In order to protect the future of the
organization in challenging times, the
Supreme Council unanimously voted to
eliminate new-member (pledge) program-
ming and the classiﬁcation of new member
(pledge),” the document said. “Those con-
cepts, which came to Sigma Alpha Epsilon
more than 60 years after our inception, will
no longer exist.”

According to the press release on Sigma

Alpha Epsilon’s national website, brothers
can continue to recruit new members just
as they had before, offering bids to potential
members.

Before the elimination of the pledging.

process, once the bid was extended, new
members were required to go through an
eight—week initiation process, during which
prospective members would have to prove
their loyaltylvand desire to be a brother of
the fraternity. Now, after the bid has been
accepted,7'__t—he men willvbecome collegiate
membersﬁivithin 96 hours of acceptance
of their}bids.+'-‘V--ti--A. ‘ '

 to Brandon Benjamin, presi-

I dent of lnterfraternity Council and a
brotherjof Delta Chi,'this initiation process I

is a time for new pledges to become accus-
tomed tovthe gfraternity, learn its traditions
and values and gain a respect for the fra-
ternity of which they are soon to be a part.

_ “In [Delta Chi], we encourage new mem-
bers to participate ﬁilly as if any otherbroth—
er in the fraternity. There is no divide except
for one secret ritual. We wait eight weeks to

show them to make sure they have a pro-
found respect and understanding for what
it means to be a Delta Chi,” Benjamin said.

In addition to the respect and educa-
tion aspect of the process, pledging has
long been a historical tradition for many
fraternities. I . p

I Benjamin does not foresee that straying
from this tradition will be a problem for the
brothers of Sigma AlphaEpsilon.

“They are good at adapting. In three or
four years, members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
.won’t know that anything is ‘different. They
won’t know that there ever was a pledging
process,” said Benjamin. 2

According to Weghorst, there was no
particular incident that led to this decision;

Pitt-based improv group  the
stage for comedic entertainment

Ruckus performs improv comedy shows every Saturday in the Cathedral. I

Staff _Wrz'ter

V Ruckus, aPitt—based improvisational comedy

group, kicked off its last performance with
its weekly ritual: a butt race. On their butts
and hands, two members of the group slid
down stairs in a lecture hall in the Cathedral
of Learning.

Ruckus is a team of 15 actors who enter-
tain with impromptu comedy sketches and
games, using audience suggestions. Ruckus
performs every Saturday at 9 p.m. in G—24 of
the Cathedral of Learning.

On Saturday, the performance contained
bouts of the ridiculousness prompted by audi-
ence suggestions to act out various situations,
such as Goldilocks camping in hell.

In this activity, actors stood in line and
told the improvised tale of Goldilocks, Mama
Satan and Papa Satan. One actor began, and
the next would continue by tagging out the
ﬁrst actor in a rapid—ﬁre game of storytelling
tag. The story ended with a ﬂame—shooting
battle and the promise of a camping trip. The
audience applauded through cries of laughter.

The audience also howled during the Good,

Bad, Worst game, during which actors gave
advice to audience members on questions
posed, such as, “How do 1 date my brother’s
girlfriend?” _

Ruckus formed in fall 2012, according to
member Lucy Clabby. Graduate student Rick
Walker decided Pitt needed an improv group.
He held auditions, and the original Ruckus
troupe was formed.

Although Ruckusperforms each weekend
in the Cathedral, the group has also made it
into some comedy clubs such as Union Pig and
ChickeninEast Liberty and Steel City Improv
Theater in Highland Park.

Clabby, a sophomore theater arts and
ﬁction writing major, said Saturday shows
have drawn a crowd of regulars for the improv
troupe. Attendance usually averages at about

30 people.

According to Ruckus member Steven
Boyd, a junior majoring in English literature
and math, once the show is over, everything
is forgotten.

“In the memory books, improv doesn’t
exist. It’s all about context. It always has to

West also said he plans to utilize differ-
ent forms of communication, such as Face-
book, email, tabling and ﬂyers, to expand
the outreach Student Government has with
the student body.

West said the Board should strive to
communicate more with students about
the allocations process and take time to
explain to student groups why allocation
requests are denied by the Board during
or after public meeting. .

“We need to show students that we’re
not these elitist people,” West said. “We’re
here because we want to help.”

Orr, who currently serves as vice chair of
the academic affairs committee, has been V
working with the committee chairman,
Robert Sica, to make OMET response avail-
able for the students to review.

The race is broken down into a series of
laps that commemorate various groups of
people affected by cancer.

The ﬁrst lap of Relay for Life is known as

l the Survivors Lap, during which all present-
’ 4 cancer survivors kicked off the event and .

walked to the cheers and encouragement of

Lap, the  Lap recognized those who

have given care to cancer patients, followed
by the Opening Lap, during which all partici-
pating teams began the 24-hour team walk.
Nevins, a senior majoring in nursing,

have to make another one greater later on,”
Boyd said.

Ruckus plays many different games
throughout the performance, including
musical games, such as making up an entire
improvisational opera on the spot.

Lex Benedict, a Ruckus member who
graduated from Pitt last semester, said his

   

favorite game is Good, Bad, Worst because
of the character it has helped him develop.

Benedict said he’s been playing a “Spanish '

guy,Juan” recently, and the character prompt-
ed an entrance applause two weeks ago.

“ [The game is] good because it challenges
you to come up with different scenarios,”
Benedict said, adding that suggestions often
include “middle school dances, salsa [and]
grocery stores.”

For all the members of Ruckus, the most
important line to rememberas an iniproviser
is, “Yes, and.”

A1"-*     

Clabby explained the rule, which is the
“ﬁrst thing every improviser learns.”

“If your co-star gives you something, you
never say, ‘N o,’ to that information. You agree
to that information, and you add something

-to it. So it’s just a matter of agreeing upon-

the world you’re existing in and giving your
partner more to work with,” Clabby said.

For Louis'Markowitz, afreshman theater
arts and English literature major, improvi-
sation allows him to do things he cannot in
regular life.

“When We’re doing improv, we get to go

‘places we never get to go, and we get to say '

things no one should ever get to say,” Mar-
kowitz said. '
Clabby also added that during improv,

reach a state of peace. _ _

of the national organization. In a message
on the national fraterr1ity’s website, helex—
pressed his interest in making the fraternity
stronger and better than how he found it.
He added that the fraternity eliminated the
word “pledge” from its nomenclature to
“keep with the times.”

“The term pledge has so many negative A
. connotations both in the Greek—letter world

and especially in today’s media. We no longer

a use this term and refer to all those j oining our

organization as new members,” he said in

e the message. “Our goals are to build chapter

unity and not new—member unity.”

’ ' According to Cohen, the new initiation
process will change the way new brothers
learn about the history of Sigma Alpha Ep-

silon.

According to the press release, the fra-

_ ternity will switch to a more “holistic educa-

tional period” that will last throughout the
student’s time as a brother of the fraternity.

“Learning never really ends. It is impor-
tant for members to learn something new

‘ every year and continue to educate them-

selves so that when they near graduation

W they will have the skills and networks to be

successful,” Weghorst said.

One of the main goals of any fraternity,
Benjamin said, is to prepare its brothers to
be successful in the ﬁiture.

Greek life is doing. When you wear the ‘let-

to get everyone sick and take away from the
awesome mentality of the event.”

Nuss said the almost-24-hour relay kept
pace with other major universities that have
held the event for the same amount of time.
Nuss added that many teams also hosted
activities, such as water pong tournaments,
cornhole games and frisbee games, through-
out the night to keep participants entertained.

Many participants also played music and
various games to occupy their time.

Groups and clubs set up tents around the T

track to stay warm, and they also had tables
liningthe entire track. Organizations sold hot

chocolate, keychains, sandwiches fromjirnmy

johns -— a sandwich chain restaurant —-— and
other snacks.

One such group was the Triangle Frater-
nity, whose members ran around shooting
marshmallows at each other with marshmal-
low guns. Several groups set up games of “bra
pong,” in which participants had to throw

A ping pongballs into bras mounted on aboard

for prizes. ’

Pitt Program Council also held, a raffle for _

tickets in the VIP section to see Timeﬂies, a
rap and techno group scheduled to play at
this year’s Bigelow Bash.

' Pauley said she was most pleased with the
creativity and cooperation between teams
this year. ‘

“People walked around the track with
hula hoops, others were wearing ﬂamingo
costumes and gorilla costumes,” Pauley, a
sophomore premed student, said. “We did
Zumba and karaoke later in the night. This

year was notable for interacﬁon between the _

teams. There was a lot more mingling and
cooperative fundraising.”

Thelplarming process was also a collab-
orative effort.

“Other organizations get involved by form- .

ing a team and ﬁmdraising,” she said. “All of
the planningis from our committees and our
chairs. In the fall, we mostly focused on get-
ting new people familiarwith Relay in general

‘and hosting some otherﬁmdraisers, like has-
ketball or soccer tournaments, to fundraise

and get our name out there.”

The Exercise Science Organization and Phi
Sigma Rho rounded out the top three groups
in terms of donations. Top individual fun-
draisers and other top groups in terms of

 

   

ﬁmdraising were armounced at the closing
ceremonies Sunday.

“The biggest fundraiser we’ve done is a
relay letter-writing campaign,” Nevins said.
“We write heartfelt letters about the cause to
send to friends and family for donations, but
also to get their support for the people actually
ﬁghting cancer.”

them,” Benjamin said. “You hold doors for
people, you participate in class, things like
that. You show people that Greek life is a
good thing.”

Benjamin said that this historical change
will do a lot to improve Greek life’s reputa-
tion as a whole. ,

According to Benjamin, a bad stigma
develops around the Greek community as
a result of the issues related to hazing. It is
commonly thought that the pledging process
always includes hazing, but according to
Benjamin, this is not always the case.

Summer Rothrock, assistant director
of Leadership Development and Greek Af-
fairs at Pitt, said that Pitt does not tolerate
any form of hazing. However, she acknowl-
edged that new member education was an
individual process~»for'each group and that
hazing is a concern for any organization.

“I commend [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] for
taking any strides that will ensure the safety

_ of college students and an enriching college

experience,” Rothrock said.
Benjamin emphasized that bad stories

C related to hazing or any other incidents

should. not be blamed on Greek life itself,
but on bad individuals within Greek life. He
said that he is hopeﬁil that this new initia-
tion process, among otherlsteps taken by
the Interfraternity Council, will help reduce
the stigma surrounding Greek life.

Benjamin also said that he hopes that
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s changes will inspire
discussion among other fraternities.

“It won’t be abandwagon thing, but other
houses will consider their attitude towards
new members and whether the gap between
new and initiated members needs to exist,”
Benjamin said.

Weghorst said he has talked to more
than 70 different media outlets since the
announcement.

“We realize that people are watching to
see how Sigma Alpha Epsilon will incorpo-
rate these changes and to see how they can
have a similar model,” Weghorst said. «_

According to Weghorst, the change has
been welcomed by most alumni and chap-
ters.

“It is hard to please all the people all the
time, but if we want to protect this organi-
zation and its future, then this is the right
thing to do,” Weghorst said. I 4

If any organization has taken the
proverb “Ifatﬁrstyou don’t succeed,
try, try again” to heart, it is the In-
ternational Monetary Fund.

Since its inception in 1945, the

‘IMF has received heavy criticism
f'rom the international community
for its policy -decisions, namely for
forcing distressed countries to enact
austerity measures and liberalize
their capital markets in return for a
badly needed loan known as “con—
ditionality.”

Yet, it has not hesitated to contin-
ue doing so. Duringthewave ofEuro-

pean Commission and the IMF —
ensuringthe solvency ofﬂoundering
European Union governments that
were forced to enact recessionary
policies in order to improve their
budgetary position.

Most recently, the IMF has
agreed to bail out Ukraine, which
is inthe midst of political turmoil, to
the tune of $14 billion to $18 billion.
And, asperusual, inreturnforaloan
to prevent the Ukrainian govem-
ment from default, the country must

A enact a set of austerity measures.

Unfortunately, this exchange will
prove devastating for Ulaaine as well
as the IMF.

There are several dilferent poli-
cies Ukraine must implement in re-
turn for this loan. However, one re-

quirement is particularly damaging

and chronologically peru'nent——- the
retraction of government subsidies
for domestic gas used for heating.

On May 1, theUktainianstate en-
ergy company Naftogaz armounced
that it would raise the price of do-
mestic gas by morethan 50 percent,
a move largely seen as a dedication
by the state to enact the I1VIF’s in-
tended policies in the ﬁxture. One of
the conditions ofUkraine receiving
a loan was curtailing subsidies, so
by taking action,‘the government
shows its commitmentto IMF-spon-
sored reform, which increases its
chances of receiving funding.

Now itis evidentthatfor Ukraine
to achieve long—term ﬁscal balance,
eliminating or largely reducingthis
subsidy is necessary, as it amounts
to 8 percent of the country’s GDP.

‘This is why it is a condition of the
IMF loan —— as a lender, the orga-
nization wants to ensure that it will
be paid back.

. Thatbeingsaid, inthe short term
this policywillleadtopolitical insta-
bility, reducing business conﬁdence
and subsequently economic activity.
This combination of civil unrest and
dwindlingtax revenues as GDP falls
will ultimately result in aworsening
of the situationinUkraine. Inapain—
fully ironic ﬁnish, the IMF will not
be paid back because of the effects
of its policyto ensure that its loan
will be honored.

But don’t take my word for it —
this narrative "has been played out
again and again across countries in
-which the IMF has intervened.

In 1998, the IMF provided a

loan of $138 million to Bolivia in
exchange for awave of privatization
in the country, including the sale of
the state water agency in the city of
Cochabamba. As water prices rose,
the city was forced to shut down for
four days as protesters ﬂooded the

‘ streets.

A year earlier, the IMF lent Indo-
nesia a loﬁy $40 billion in exchange
for the closure of several insolvent
banks in the aftermath of the East
Asianﬁnancial crisis.Then, in1998,
in reuim for an installment of this
payment, the country removed
subsidies on food and fuel for its
citizens, sparkingriots and resulting
in the resignation of President Haji
Muhammad Suharto. Laterthatyear,

the IMF ended up allowing these subsidies to
be reinstated.

Clearly, fomenting civil unrest by remov-
ing food, fuel or water subsidies is bad social
policy. It destroys business conﬁdence and
shoves international investment out of the
country, as business activity is hampered by
riots and, in the case of Bolivia, it can even
result in the closure of the entire city.

Unfortunately, this is also whatwill result
from the removal of heating gas subsidies
in Ukraine. In the words of Greg Palast in
The Guardian, writing on the IMF’s actions
in the late 1990s, “The IMF riot is painﬁilly
predictable.” l .

The country might be saved from further
unrest for the time being, as the demand for
heating gas is heavily reduced  the
spring and summer. However, come winter,
Ukrainianicitizens who carmot aﬁ'ord-toiheat
their homeswill certainly notbe pleasedgwith

whichever politicianwinsthe upcoming elec-

tion.

Additionally, consumers will not only
be faced with higher gas prices, but also de-
creased purchasing power. Inﬂation is expect-
ed to increase by 12 to 14 percent in response
to the Ukrainian hryvnia — the country’s cur-
rency —— now trading freely on international
markets and a rise in gas prices for heating
companies, two policies also pushed by the

As if all weren’tenou'gh,-. the,di;sso1u—
tion of heatinggas subsidies poses another

ther gas price manipulation by Russia, which
hasn’t hesitated to use its market power to
wreak havoc in the country before. Thus,
this policy might not only lead to civil unrest
and economic weakness, but also thwart the
international political goals of most of the
countries that fund the IMF by increasing
Russia’s influence over Ukraine.

Perhaps the IMF should take a lesson from
comedian W.C. Fields, who advised, “If at ﬁrst
you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No
use being a damn fool about it.” I

Another Final Four has passed, and Pitt
was left out once again.

After Pitt’s loss in the round of'32 in the
NCAA Tournament, contributing players
felt dejected and torn as they slouched
in locker room chairs. Some hung their

' heads, and others untied their shoes for

the ﬁnal time as Panthers.
But many probablyhattempted to pre-
maturely solve the question, “Was it_a suc-

. cessful season?” .
More than two weeks havepassed since

the stingingrloss, and the answer seems to
be clearing up. '
On the court, 2013-2014 was just the

A third 1o—plus loss season in thejamie Dix-

on-era-. Asecond—round loss to a team that
hadn’t lost since September isnothing to
be ashamed of. , '

C It seems like a pedestrian year, but a
lack of off—the-court issues and unprec-
edented team discipline helped the pro~
gram reach anew level of respect, which
is a legitimate reason forplayers to lift
their chins. V _ .

Cameron Wright said that clean record
can be attributed to the players the coach-
ing staff wants on its team.

,“ [They don’t] just target guys who want
to be really great at basketball,” Wright, a

redshirtjunigr guard and business major,
' said. “They target guys who really want to

be great at life.” ‘
Before Pitt’s opening—round game in
the ACC Tournament, ACC Commissioner
‘John Swofford honored Wright with the

Sometimes the actual action in a game
against a No. 1 team doesn’t come close to

the hype that builds beforehand.
When the top-ranked Virginia Cavaliers
showed up in Pittsburgh on Friday, they
, made- it clear that a letdown in reality would
not be the case.
Friday, April 5
In baseballthere are great performanc-
es, there are dominating performances
and then there are performances such as

the one that University of Virginia sopho--

more pitcher Nathan Kirby put on Friday
evening. l ' . ‘ 1
Kirby no—hit Pitt while striking out 18
batters en route to the Cavaliers’ 4-0 win
over the Panthers. b
Although the Panthers had just suf-

fered a deﬂating defeat, they were quick

to compliment the ace of the No. 1—ranked
Cavaliers after the game. :

“He just commanded the strike zone,”
Pitt slugger £300 Vazquez, who only struck
out once Friday night, said. “He never really

fell behind hitters. Every time you looked .
up it seemed like it was a 0-2 count.”.'

That command was on full display, ‘as 87
of Kirby’s 122 pitches were strikes, while
his fastball velocity remained between
92 and 95 mph throughout the game. The
loss was also the first time the Panthers
have ever been either shut out or no-hit at
Charles L. Cost Fieldin their four_seasons

' playing there. ' .

‘ Pitt head coach Joe jordano had little
choice but to praise Kirby’s performance

. as well.

“Obviously that was a completely dom-
inating performance by Nathan Kirby,”

jjordano said. ‘_‘It was possibly one of the

best games in my 27 years that was thrown
against us.”

His performance received national at-
tention, as it was highlighted on CBSSports.
com’s Eye on Baseball, and the ﬁnal out of
the game topped SportsCenter’s nightly
top 10 plays.

Despite the utter domination that oc:
curred Friday night, the Panthers’ players.
and coaches were well aware that this was
just one game of a three—game series.

“For us, it’s a matter of how we re-
spond,”jordano said. “I’m sure that we
will come out and compete tomorrow.”

Vazquez felt the same.

“It’s gonna sting a little,” Vazquez said
after the game. “But once my head hits
the pillow, I’m worried about the game
tomorrow.”

Panthers salvage series, hold eighth place with Sunday victory

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt’s softball team lost its series against Bos-
ton College, but the Panthers still retumed
home as winners.

Pitt held athree-game lead overthe Eagles
for eighth place in the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference standings, thelast seed that makes
the conference tournament. As long as they
weren’t swept in Chestnut Hill, Mass., this
weekend, the Panthers would still cling to a
postseason spot with 13 ACC games remain-
ing. ° _ ‘
So although Pitt -dropped two of three
games this weekend at Shea Stadium against
Boston College — losing 5-3 in the ﬁrst game
of a double-header Saturday afcemoon, then
13-4 in six innings for the second game ‘and
ﬁnishingwithaz-ovictory Sunday afternoon
—- it left on top. ‘ '

junior outﬁelder Carly Thea realized the
importance of holding on to eighth place,
but wanted better results out of tlie weekend.

“That deﬁnitely helps us a bit,” Thea said.

“It would’ve helped more to win two of three 1

or three of three, butwinning one of the games
was big.”.

But after Saturday, which was a day to for-
get for most of the Panthers, the situation

' looked bleak.

Junior Savannah Kingwas handed the loss
after throwingjust four innings, in which she
allowed ﬁve runs (four earned) on just three
hits. King showed erratic control, though,

throwing just .58 strikes in her 111 pitches, '

which led to seven walks. Her sevenfree pass-
es marked the second-highest total, edged

only by an eight-walk performance March“-. 5

1 against Kentucky. But King pitched 8 273
innings that game, more than twice as long
as she lasted on Saturday.

Through three innings, King had not al—
lowed a hit, but the Panthers still trailed, 1-0.
By the fourth, though, Boston College charged

ahead for a 5-0 advantage. The Eagles scored ‘

of King, tossing a scoreless ﬁfth and sixth,
Pitt began to pick up steam offensively. Tori
Nirschl crushed a two—run home run in the

back-to—back doubles in the seventh, but '

the Panthers’ window for a comeback was
slammed shutwithaﬂyout and two strikeouts.

“It was tough because there was nothing

King’s outing was plagued with inconsis-

striking out just four batters.

EMERGENCIES WELCOME

 

Although frequent walks slow the pace of
the ‘game and prevent ﬁelders from staying on
their toes, Thea said she knew the high walk
totals weren’t a reason to panic.

“It’s not tough to stay focused,” she said.
“Sometimes you’re gonna have games like
that. Even though it’s walks now, it could be
strikeouts [later]. I’m always focused and on
my toes.”

There wasn’t much’ for Pitt to take away
from the 13-4 drubbing in six innings. The
Panthers couldn’t score with the bases loaded
in the ﬁrst inning, but allowed the Eagles to

Virginia Tech was the only other school

not only saw big—time prospects, but big-

“Character in kids,” Dixon said.
“There’s a lot of good players out there
who we’d like to recruit, but there are
things that come ‘with them, and we have
to make those decisions, and -obviously
how they represent the conference, the
team and the University has been very

has resisted issues with rule—breaking. I
Pitt players —— and coaches, for that

“I think we all come from pretty good
families, so I think we just don’t really
have any past instances where we’ve been
in trouble prior to coming to college,”

sophomore guard James Robinson said. ,

“Once we got here, our coaches held us
to really high standards, which is a really
good thing for us. And also, we’ve spent a
lot of time together off the court as a team,
so we hold each other accountable, too.”

“That just plays a factor in everybody

just staying out of the way off the court,”-

Robinson added.

Perhaps the most stunning of Pitt’s '

behavioral triumphs appeared in nightly
box scores. I

Pitt’s players did not pick up any tech— 4
nical fouls in their 36 games. The team .
beat its coach in that regard, since Dixon C

was whistled for one after arguing a call
at Syracuse.

According to Dixon, most people don’t
realize that these are some of the reasons

that led Swofford and his band of ACC s

commissioners to Pitt’s door in 2011,

I knocking with an invitation to join the

conference.

“When conferences went to look to ex-
pand, those are the things that factored in
as well, how you do things, andthe types of
kids you have-and the decisions you make.
I think we made thatdecision longago in

f this programat this University that those

things matter,” Dixon said. J
A decade ago, the NCAA developed a
statistic known as Academic Progress Rate

to measure the overall eligibility of a team ~
and to project each team’s graduation rate. .

NCAA-member, programs that fail to
piece together consecutive seasons above
the 9o0—mark — graduating about45
percent of players — in APR could be
subjected to postseason and scholarship
penalties. ‘A .

This past season, -Pitt ranked highly a
19th with a 975 APR out of 68 teams that
made the NCAA Tournament. The Insti-
tute for Diversity and Ethics in Sportwat
the University of Central Florida released
the results. ,

' What-’s more, Dixon’s players have
posted an incredible 8o—plus percent
graduation rate since 2002.

All ‘of this will allow Dixon to cross
his legs and get comfortable after some
of this summer’s recruiting trips, since
academics are a thought he will not have
to address. .

the board came in the fourth inning.

To open the frame, outﬁelder and pitch-
er Stephen Vranka reached on an inﬁeld hit
to Virginia shortstop Daniel Pinero. Vranka
was advanced to second on a sacriﬁce bunt
by Pitt shortstop Dylan Wolsonovich, and
he moved to third in the ensuing at-bat,

t a sacriﬁce ﬂy to. right ﬁeld by outﬁelder

Casey Roche.

With two outs, though, left ﬁelder Boo
Vazquez was unable to convert on the RBI
opportunity, hitting a feeble line drive di-
rectly at Pinero.

It was the only inning in the game that a
Pitt base runner had reached scoring posi-
tion, a sign of Waddell’s dominance, which

‘inﬁelderjordan Frabasilio attributed to a

smart approach.

“[Waddell] would add and subtract
speed well on his fastball just to throw tim-
ing off of our hitters, sneak over a little
change up and use his curveball at the right
time,” Frabasilio, who had one of the two
Panther hits that afternoon, said.

After a starter such as Waddell puts to-
gether an outstanding performance, the
opposing" band of hitters usually sees an
opportunity when a relief pitcher takes to
the mound. That wasn’t the case Sunday,

_ though, because the ‘Cavaliers have a prom-

ising young closer in Nick Howard (1-0, 1.76
ERA), whose fastball can reach 96 mph.
Howard needed just eight pitches‘ to
ﬁnish the job that Waddell had started.
“That’s the best pitching staff, top to
bottom, we’ve faced this year,” Jordano
said. “That guy coming out of the pen there
is one of the best in the country.” 4
The numbers back ]ordano’s claim —-—

Virginia’s starting pitchers posted a 0.04
ERA on the weekend — but the Panthers
coachlwas off on one thing: Howard didn’t
actually arrive from the bullpen.

He started at ﬁrst base for the Cavaliers
and was responsible for a hit and an RBI
off Pitt’s Matt Wotherspoon in the fourth
inning.

The hit scored ﬁrst—team All-American
Mike Papi, who hit a one—out double of the
right ﬁeld wall, giving Virginia a 1-0 lead.

“You don’t get away with quite as many

pitches or mistakes,” Wotherspoon said.

“But I left a changeup up in the zone [to
Papi], and I kind of just hung it there. He

hit it off the top of the wall, and I tip my

cap to him. He hit my mistake.”

Wotherspoon ﬁnished with six strike-
outs, but four hits.and two walks in seven
full innings of work.

Virginia got its other two runs in the
ninth’ off reliever Hobie Harris and Jon
Danielczyk. Both runs were credited to
Harris, who, coming into the game, had
thrown more than 13 consecutive scoreless
innings of work.

“It’s tough,” Wotherspoon added. “I
hate the term moral victory, but we’ve got
to win one. You can’t get swept at home,
but you can get out of it that we can play
with any team in the country.”

A feeling of accomplishment was conta-
gious in the dugout after the game.

“There are a lot of positive things we did
this weekend,” Frabasilio said. “We played
clean, we played hard, stuck it out against
the No. 1 team. It would’ve been nice to
get the series win, but we got one at least.”
