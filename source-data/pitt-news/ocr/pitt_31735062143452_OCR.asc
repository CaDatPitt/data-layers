Chairman After Tie

Moving rapidly through committee
reports after it had elected the chair-

man of Senior Announcements com--,

mittee, Student Council, at its meet-
ing Wednesday night, voted to request
all organizations -participating in
sprin-g tapping exercises to share ex-
penses of the two special assemblies,
urged further investigations of alleg-
edly deﬁcient University services, and,
voiced its d-isplea.sure with VVSGA in
carrying out an unauthorized sale of
senior keys for both men and women.

Robert Beck, Bus. Ad., was elected},
chairman of the announcements com-
mittee after he had tied for the posi-
tion with Ruth Hamilton, Col., on a
third ballot. A suggestion that 00-
chairmen be appointed when it was
evident th-at the vote was equally di-
vided was rejected, and Beck was
elected on a fourth ballot. It was
pointed out in the meeting that the
position carries with it a return in
sales commissions of approximately
$100. _ V_

Ask Expense Relief

Presented with a treasurers report
showing a bank balance of $147.59,
Council unanimously approved amo-
tion by Arthur Gold-berg, Col. '33, urg-
ing that all organizations tapping new
members at the honorary scholastic
and activities assemblies be asked to
share with Council the expenses in-
volved in planning the exercises.
Goldberg, Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. '3 ,

and Ray McCune, Eng. ’34, were ap-

pointed to interview officers of these
groups and formulate some plan upon!
which Council might act.

The report of Investigations Chair-
man W'ilkison on the University
Book Store opened a. general tirade,
participated in by almost every mem-
ber. on the improvement of campus
facilities affecting the welfare of the
student body.‘ The book store report
brought out that the University sells
text books at a ﬁve per cent discount
from list prices for the student body,
and that prices on note paper, covers
and other supplies are set at ﬁat sale
prices designed to a-ss.ure the students
savings. _ _ _ , .

Urge’ Investigation

Representative Breene, questioning.
the policy of the book store on the
basis .. of .. comment heard among _ -£116
undergraduates, urged the investiga-
tion"of’ the possibility‘ of adopting a-
coop"erati_vei student-alur'nni owner-

.ship plan’ similar'"to that in effect at '

Princeton Univer-sity._V __Under this
system,‘ he said, students and alumni.
buy memberships in the store’-a.sso~
ciation for ﬁve dollars, receive charge
accounts through‘ which to make
their purchases, and, as a result,‘get
savings of approximately ﬁfteen per
cent on each purchase over the period
of the year. Dividends are returned
to all accredited members, the store
operating on a non-profit basis, he
said.

.The investigations chairman also
was called upon to try to improve fa-
cilities V’ for the cashing of. personal
checks. by students through University
treasurer’s office; was asked to look
into the conditions responsible for in-
adequate. elevator service in. the Ca-
thedral, andfheard another member

Rap Key Sales

The Academic Dress committee of
WSGA, this week conducting a sales
campaign of senior keys. among both
men and women, came in for criti-
cism when it was pointed out by Gold-
berg that the committee. had gone
ahead on apro-ject affecting students
outside the women’s governing body
without ﬁrst consulting Council.

President Reed Rose, Dent. ’33, ex-
plained Council’s position on the mat-
ter when he said:

“Matters of dress for senior women
is certainly within the ‘jurisdiction of
this sub-governing body, but the sale-
of seniorkeys to both men and wo-
men is a subject for Council's action.
In carrying out this sales campaign
they have also takenover a function
that rightfully. belongs to the senior
week committee. Their action is un-
doubtedly motivated .by good spirit,
and probably was unintentionally in
encroaching on Councils field."

As a result of the discussion, the
presidents of other sulb-governing or-
ganizations are to be invited to attend
the next meeting of Council.

Steps taken by Student Relations
committee to prevent further’ dance
failures were reported by Chairman
Kallfelz. It is being tentatively plan-
ned, he reported, to change the date
of the Senior Ball fro.m.June.2_ to. May

“The most expedient wayof con-.
ducting business is through commit-.
tees,” Mrs. Charles F. Lewis of the
Buhl Foundation, former teacher at
Langley High School, told Cwens at
a supper meeting last Tuesday night
in the Heinz House.

“Small committees should do most-
of the work and attend to the petty
business details, while the right to
accept and reject already. formulated
proposals should be reserved to a. gen-
eral meeting of all members. Have
your big meetings of a social charac-
ter,” Mrs, Lewis further advised in
her talk on “Parliamentary Pro-
cedure.” Mary 'G. Herron, Col. ’35,‘
was in charge of the affa.ir.

Meet Today

Education Assembly Takes
Place at I-Ieinz House

P.reparation and in_struction for the
big rush season starting next Thurs-
day will be given to advanced fresh-
men and transfer students at the an-
nual freshman. education assembly
place during drill
hour, today, at Heinz House.

.Frances ‘Abes, Ed. ’33, chairman of
freshman. education, will open the
meeting promptly at 12:30‘ o’clock.
The program planned will tend to ex-
plain the etiquette of rushing and the
technicalities involved. The prospec-
tive rushees will receive their ﬁrst in-
troduction from the members of the
women's fraternity committee, Thyrsa
W. Amos, dean of women; Helen P.
Rush, assistant to the dean of wo-
men; Dr. Lotte Lohstoetter, assistant
professor of education; Blossom. Hen-
ry, assistant professor of modern lan-
guages; and Ellen M. Geyer, associate
professor of education.

Frances Abes, who will talk on the
technicalities of rushing, will place
particular stress on the proper meth-
od of ﬁlling in and returning bid bal-
lots. A great many errors have been
made by freshmen in past years in
ﬁlling in ballots resulting in misun-
derstandings between. the fraternity
and the rushee. Miss Abes will also
discuss the etiquette of receiving and
answering invitations together with
the proper attitude to maintain at
rushing parties.

Mary G-arber, Col. '33, president of
Paliliellenic Association, will speak
on -the ﬁnancial aspect of fraternity.
The.sophomore and senior outlook on
fraternity will be presented by Muriel
Dils, Ed., and Dorothy Getsinger, Ed.,
respectively. Miss Amos will discuss
“The University’s Attitude Toward
Fraternities.”

As an additional aid in clarifying}
fraternity to the rushees “O Philos,”
the yearly publication of Panhellenic,
will be distributed. The hand-book,
which gives fraternity values and in-
formation, was edited this year by
Ethel Silverblatt, Col. ’34. .
_ The main rushing season of the
year for women’s fraternities opens
next Thursday at 5 o’clock. Parties
may be held that day until 9 o’clock.
Rushing hours. for Friday are 12:30
to 1:40 and 5:30 -to 9:30. Saturday
rushing will begin at.8:30 o’clock in
the morning and will last until 12
o’clock midnight. . _

Formal. dinners, bridges, and novel
parties are among the affairs planned
by fraternity women for rushees.

Men Rushees
Number 600

Short'ened Period Points to
Less Hectic Season

At 8:30 o’clock Monday morning,
about 70 new freshmen and between
500 and 600 advanced freshmen and
upperclassmen will be initiated -into
the rigors of men’s fraternity rushin
for the second semester. -

In all probability, events will hard-‘
ly be of the whirlwind and the high
tension nature of those that marked
the rushing season of last semester.
Interfraternity C0uncil"s action in re-
ducing the season by three days in
beginning it Monday instead of today,
and the reasons Council gave for this
decision: a small incoming group of
freshmen; atrend toward economy;
and a reluctance to impair in any way
the success of tonight’s Junior Prom,
all point toward a subduing of the
usual hectic splurge of events.

Rushing this time will be carried
on under the same rules and regula-
tions laid down -- last semester.
Rushees are warned, especially, by
Council and by the Oﬁice of the Dean
of Men that they must cooperate in
insuring that no infractions of the
code occur on their accounts. The
chief “don’t” of the rules states that‘
no rushee shall remain over night
either in a fraternity house or in. the
home of a fraternity member or
pledge.

Events Unlimited

Events of the season are unlimited,
but a previous decree of the adminis-
tration prohibiting' the holding of
dances on any nights other than on
Fridays or Saturdays, allows each
fraternity no more than two of these
affairs. Last semester there was
room for four. The majority of events
will be in the form of theater parties,
smokers, and bridge sessions.

Rushing closes at 2:00 o’clock in
the morning of Sunday, February 26,
after which time no new freshman
may speak to any fraternity man, ad-
vaced freshmen and upperclassmen
who have been rushed are not permit-
ted to speak» to the members of fra-
ternities that have entertained them
with p1edgesl1ip in mind. V V

Father Appeals To News
In Search For Lost Son

 

An appeal was made this week to
the Pitt News by Henry C. Gibbs, 1821
Newton st., N, \V., Vvashington, D. 0.,
to aid in the search for his son who
has been missing for more than a
month.

After sending his father letters
threatening suicide, Henry Hunting-
don, a sophomore in the Wharton
School of Finance at the University
of Pennsylvania, disappeared at the
close of school on the afternoon of
January 6.

It is believed that the boy suffered
from a lapse of memory from a nerv-
ous breakdown. Young Gibbs is a
tall, blond boy. six feet, three to four
inches tall, and weighs fr,om»‘I35“'to
145 pounds. His left arm is slightly
crooked from a break one inch above
the elbow, suffered when he _was a
lad of seven years.

Any information leading to the
knowledge of the whereabouts of the
boy will be appreciated by his father.

Pitt Forensic Tourists, Invading South, are Conquered
by Southern Belles, Mild Climate

After two weeks in cotton planta-
tions and kumquat groves, in goober-
nut ﬁelds and peanut heaven, Pitt's
roving debaters have returned home
from the South. The local spellbind-
ers spent their extra time debating
war debt cancellation, and in what
few hours they had off the forensic
arena, they staged a ripsnorting con-
test of their own,

For the Southern States men have
been traveling in the most approved
debating style—thcir automobile has
won some close decisions and aside
from several setbacks on the plat-
form, the spellbinders have bowed to
three policemen, eight chain-gang
keepers. and 4,364 beautiful girls,

In a diary of the trip, kept by John
Bracken, Leonard Boreman, the de-
ba.ters,- Coach Richard ‘Murphy and
James Danahey, theoutstanding news
is the climate, the girls, and the girls.
Debating is also mentioned,

The jaunt began on January 30,
when the traveling haranguers saw
Senator Huey P. Long wave his arms
in reply to our own David Reed. They
climbed the dome of the capitol, and,
0E in the distance, declares Boreman,
was the Cathedral of Learning.-

An old colonial meeting house was
in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Two
colonels fainted as they heard two
hours of speaking without a single
mention of Thomas Jefferson, and had

to be revived with anti-prohibition

mint julops, flavored with Pittsburgh
ketchup.

John Bracken, already vvel1 known
as the Pitt campus breaker of'hearts
de luxe, refused dates with Charles-
ton's finest, states his teeth-gnashing
colleague. The rash act was attrib-
uted to a temporary inferiority com-
plex——the boys had lost an audience
decision.

“Them farmers out in Ioway are
raising Sam,” declared one of the
Southland's debaters, “and we all has
got to be careful.” And to make mat-
ters worse, Pitt's pride and joy ended
the same evening on a fraternity
house mattress stuffed with granite
and pine needles. The next morning,
they all was raisin’ Sam, too.

Reporter Boremaifs concrete details
lapsed under the Florida sun, and his
only comments concerned, of _.all
things, the weatller. Thus a typical
passage from his idyll reads, "The
weather is marvelous,” Then, in an-
other place, he says, “No need for
coats now-it looks like the middle
of July.” Or, again, “We're wearing
light clothes, for " etc.

WIOD, Miami's radio station with
a hankering for culture, broadcast.
the debate between the University of
Miami and Pitt on Monday. Our re-

cent’ weather disturbance is thus ac-

counted for. But Bracken and Bore-
man beyond a doubt, proved to the
South that cancellation of war debts
would be the greatest thing since the
carpet-baggers. They're here today,
gone tomorrow.

I9th Annual Scholastic Meet
Scheduled to Take Place
In Trees Pool, Mar. 3, 4

Award Winners Medals’

return of invitations sent to morel
than 70 schools to participate in the
Um'versity’s nineteenth annual schol-
astic swimming meet scheduled for
the Trees Gym pool l\-larch 3 and 4.

This year's invitation list, almost
double that of last year when 40 in-
vitations were tendered senior and
junior high schools in the tri-state
area, includes many teams who have
been - consistent performers a.t the
scholastic event in the past few years.
South, Carrick, Allegheny, Langley,
Carrick. Schenley, Munhall, Duquesne,

Clairton, Butler, Academy, '1‘ecb, and
Erie Strong-Vincent of Erie, Pa.;
East Liverpool and Canton McKin-
ley are included in the invitation list.

As in years past, gold, silver, and
bronze medals will be awarded place
medals in each -of the six carded
events, with a trophy for the winner
of the 160-yard relay and another-
trophy for the school scoring the
most points in competition.

In the senior high school class the
program includes the 40, 100 and 220-
yard free style dashes; 100-yard back
stroke event, fancy dive, and the four-
Inan 160-yard relay. The junior pro-
gram includes dashes and a. medley»
relay.

its fifth consecutive University high
school championship. Ruunerup to
the Erie high school's swimmers from
which seven swimmers will be enter-
ed this year was the Carrick school.

nine-year record was shattered when
Sugart, McGovern, Mattis, a11d Hig-
gins swam the 160-yard relay in
1:21 2-5. Rollinger of Academy broke
t.he 40-yard free style dash, while La-

sity record in the 220-yard free style
event. The other me_et rec_ord to go
by the boards was in the junior med-
ley relay which was '~-W011‘ by Brad- '
dock. “

Ineligibility Occasions
Postponement Of Boat

The overhanging scepter of ineligi-
bility snapped VVeduesday afternoon
to crush the hopes for further compe-
tition this semester of four Carnegie
Tecli boxers and occasioned the an-
nouncement that the intercollegiate
boxing match between Carnegie Tech
and Pitt scheduled for last evening
in the Stadium had been indeﬁnitely

postponed.
Croissant, Kulesz, Restaine. and
Comuntzis were counted out when

the results of the first semester ex-
a.mina1‘:ions were announced which
left Coach Frank Sesto with less than
2. 50 per cent squad.

The suspended collegiate match
will not be entirely a-bandone-zl, how-
ever. It is planned to reschedule. the

Panther-Plaid bouts for some time the

‘ship that may come t.o mind.

 

-has to be a dtﬂerent kind of
tobacco from that used in
o::i.ga.rettes . ; . and it has to be
made by an entirely dtjferent
process . . .

UT in Kentucky, where they have
pretty women, fast horses, and

blue grass, there

White Burley. 
else in the world.

There is a type of this White Burley
that is best suited for pipe smoking. It
is neitheritoo thick nor too thin. It is
not light and chaffy; at the same time,
it is"n,ot* rank or stroncr. .."U. 8. Type
31” is the govrernment classification
for White Burley.

Since no other pipe tobacco has yet
been found which seems to equal ‘White

’ Burley, this is what we use in making
Granger Rough Cut.

Next, we use

a famous 1870 method of making pipe
tobacco, to give Granger its ﬁne ﬂavor
and fragrance. Then, too, Granger is
"Rough Cut”——-just like they used to
"whitt1e” their tobacco off a plug with

does11’t grow anywhere

grows a tobacco called

the Wellman Method,

a jack-knife. It smokes cool, lasts longer

and never gums '

a pipe.

And ﬁnally, we Want to sell Granger
for 10 cents. Good tobacco.-—righl; pro-

cess .-cut right.

So we put Granger in

a sensible soft foil pouch instead of an

expensive package, knowing that a man
can°t smoke the package.
Granger has not been on sale very
~ long, but it has grown to be a popular
smoke. Folks seem to like it.

15 games they have played, and the
Blutihnen having copped 9 out of 10.
The Dukes have won nine in success-

Raising -The $I:airic'I»arcIs

EAN SIEG’S announcement of more rigid requirements for ad-
inission to professional courses in the School of Education should
interest ‘ever-_vone--who is concerned over the future of the teaching
profession. The new rcqu'iI'eInonts, effective next‘ Septcnibcr, are de-
signed to; limit students in the School of Ediication to those best
ﬁtted.-and most interested in the -work. I

Under the new policy, students in schools other than Education
who wish to fulfill the requiremciits for Pennsylvania tcacliers’ certi-
ﬁcates may choose one of two alternatives for undergraduate prepa-
ration. First, they niay tI'a-nsferto the prc-education division before
or during; their sophomore year _ and complete their professional.
t.raininp: as -students in the -School of Education. If, however, these
students pro-fer._to remain in the school of their original choice, they
may “elect-"’ professioiial education courses, provided they have sat-
isfied the new prerequisite rcquirenients announced this Week.

The addition of new course requirements, particularly-as it will
affect transfers from the College and the Schools of Business Admin-
istration, Engincering and Mines, ,st.I-engthcns the position of the
School of Education in the “professional” group. Enforcement of
the policy will -certainly serve to raise the standards of the teaching
profession above their present level.

'l‘caching, as .a. profession, trade or pastime, has become the
“catch—all’.’l for misﬁt college and university graduates of: recent
years. Faced by the prospects of unemployment in the ﬁelds of
their preparation, hundreds of students have turned to teacliiiig after
g‘I‘aCl11a.‘I‘.lOI1.' ' I

It has become the accepted practice for students in all scliools
of a. university, regardless of how distasteful the idea. is to them, to
elect enough courses in education to guarantee a teacl1er’s certiﬁ-
cate and——with the necessary luck-and political pull-—perhaps a job.
Tcacliing has come to be known as the “way out” for the college
man or w_oI_nan.« Sonic rationalize and look upon it as a stepping
stone to something higher in another ﬁeld. But for the true student
of education there exists no higher calling, and there can be no other
ﬁeld.

The way.should be made difﬁcult for the student who would
accept teaching as aulast resort; he can. be of little credits to the
profession and of still,le'ss to himself. ’ Dean Sieg and his associates
have taken».-an iInportant»ste.p in thisdirection by increasing the re-
-quircments: for admission to -professional courses in education.

Assembly Problem I

S TUDENTS who_‘.may have wondered‘ why there lizive been" so few

general -assemblies-since: tlI‘e~opcniIi«g' ' of school in September
‘might be,surp.rise‘d to‘. learn that here, again, thercason for curtail-
ment is a ﬁnancial one: .that the same depression that has reduced
the costs ofugrasoline and t.wo-pants suits apparently has had no-eﬂ:'ect
on the cost--of: obtaining a speaker "for Mcinorial I-Iall.

‘hnnkstall
(balling

By Don Early

 

   

In some respects, this Twenty-tliird
Annual Exhibition of the Associated
'Artists of Pittsburgh is the most in-
teresting of the year up to this point.
Since the close of the International,
this has been the only large-scale art
show we have had to look forward to.
and ‘this year brings the scale a little
ihigher, both in variety of interest and
‘in standard of serious and commenti-
able acconiplisliiiieut. Not that 11
score or so of sour efforts were not
included. II1 an organization which
attempts-to represent as Inuch ama-
teurwork as possible this is to be ex-
pected, Even bad examples are val-
uable in constituting the lower end of‘
3, ‘gauge of comparative achievement.
It is only when some of these. have the
misfortune to emerge in the limelight
of prize-winning works that we grow
uneasy, .skeptica1, and wonder what
the judges were thinking about when
they made their decisions.

Certainly_ this year's exhibition
ought to be one in which the protests
of popular and cultured appreciations
over the prize winners join hands. To
be sure, this is a rare coincidence.
But it is highly questionable whether
popular taste still lags’ so far in the
musty“ woi‘1d~- of Currier and.Ives
Prints and smoky chromos, or that the
‘levels of decent taste should sudden-
ly be swung downward by the de-
cisions of judges whose interests ap-
pear to have been shaped more by in-
ﬂueuce and the promptings of their
pockets than by any sincere consid-
eration of art. ,

Everything pointed to a beautiful
emergence of the John Kane school of
painting. Whatever the aim of these
two men‘——~Mr. Kane who won first
prize, and Mr. Blanchard who won
third prize and who is doing his best
to follow in the forme1"s paint pots, it
is extremely diﬂicult to say, 0ne’s
conceptions of art have to be broad7
these days to include‘ much -dI‘:veI'siﬁed
work. But the lines must be drawn
somewhere. It seems stretching the
scale beyond the point of elasticity to
consider a clutter of (1011 houses;
puppets, and moii-ldy green hillsides

worth the Iaurels of first prize. Per-
haps Mr. Kane is a primitive. We
feel, however, it. is. not so much

through choice as through a common-
place understanding and a lack of
ability to give anything of life,
warmth. color, atmosphere or interest-
ing composition to his work.

Real excellence in the show lay
elsewhere. One always ﬁnds a sus-
tained classic ﬁnish to Sh111g‘0ld"S
work, His portraits, that of Gladys
Schmitt and that of his brother, are
extremely well done, though his study
called Tragedienne and the large nude
are somewhat more convincing,

It is the younger artists who are
more interesting. . Richard Crist’s
work is about as ﬁne as can be found
in tlie whole exhibition. Some of his
paintings have appeared in several
shows about town this Year, and one
feels growingly the excellent possi-
bilities of this artist. He approaclies
each painting, first of all, as a prob-
lem in art and he shows a facility for
,bringing most of the painter’s graces
with him——a ﬁne iinderstanding of
color, particularly in handling large’
spaces and in building up form, and
in a sureness of compact composition,
His attitude toward form comes out‘
well -in Gladioli. Here the feeling is‘
not so much concerned with ﬂowers"
as with full, sensuous bodies of color.
His other works in the show are The'»
spires, Portrait of Mr.s.”Davev Thornp-"

Debate Prom Policy

(Continued From Page One.)
-.1 better clumce to draw more of the

Discuss Prom

Kallfelz stated that the special ad-
visory committee appointed by Coun
cil to aid dance chairnien had recom-
mended zi $3.00 top price for the Ju-
nior Prom, and had suggested that
they cut the rental price and reduce
their expenditiiro for music. The
Prom committee. he said, maintained
its original position. feeling certain
its plans were within reason. Presi-
dent Rose asked:

“Have ‘you ever thought of forcing
a. dance committee to keep its expen-
ditures within the limits you feel to
be most practical?”

“If the dance committee is un:—'1ni-
mous in its support of its plans, I
don’): feel we can do anything about
it,” Kallfelz replied. “But if Council‘
wants. us to experiment along those
lines I would be glad to give it a try.”

Goldberg. after stating he thought
the Prom should be considered as the
“ﬁnal experiment” and action of

Council be based on its ﬁria.ncia‘1 out- I

come, added the statement:

“I don’t think it is" fair for Council
to criticize the-Prom two days before
the time of the dance. If the dance
fails, then it is time to -take action
on the entire social program.”

Betty Quarrie, Co1., voiced her dis-
approval of alleged “liandic-ups” the
committee had to overcome, saying:

“If the dance is a success, it will
be an unusual one, for no other dance
this year has received so Inuch ad-
verse publicity.” Her staizemeiit ap-
parently was directed at editorials
printed in the News during the past
month.

The meeting adjourned after the se-
lection of keys had been deferred to
Thursday and Friday of tliis week.

Coed-s at the University of Mis-

United They Stand.
An “American Intercollegiate Asso-

ciation of Gigolos" has been formed
as the answer to the cry of‘ the co-I
eds, who far outniunber the men, for
escorts to social events. The student
sponsors dedicated themselves to spe-
cialize in supplying “the proper man
in the proper attire for any and every
occasion,” and said they would seek
to organize chapters throughout the

coun try.

Believe It Or Not-
