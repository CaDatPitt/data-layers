FOOTBALL

Bennett  
delivers in
victorious
spot start

Dan Sostek
Staff Writer

As the 2013 Pitt football season has pro-
gressed, fans and pundits alike have
raved about the play of freshman run-
ning backjames Conner. And that raving
is justified, as Conner has compiled two
100-yard performances and four rush-
ing touchdowns, while taking the major-
ity of the carries. Conner had appeared
to have secured the role of primary back.

Because of Conner’s success, many
began to overlook a certain junior run-
ning back on the team, a running back
with more career carries than anyone
else on the roster. This junior is Isaac
Bennett, who, despite being listed as
the starter on the official depth chart,
has recently taken a back seat to the
freshman phenom Conner.

Many in Bennett’s place would pout.
Some would shy away from teammates.
Some might complain publicly. But that
isn’t who Bennett is.

No rush to live like Greeks in converted frat houses

Danielle Fox
Staff W riter

There is no rush, initiation or hazing. The
easiest way for a freshman to go Greek
this term is to be assigned to a house ——'
by the University.

While ﬁrst—year students typically live
in on-campus dormitories, such as Litch-
ﬁeld Towers and Sutherland Hall, about
60 ﬁrst—year male students currently live

in three of the University—owned frater-
nitybuildings. At least one of the build-
ings became available after a fraternity
violated its code of conduct and lostrec-
ognition by the University.

Each of the converted houses accom-
modates about 20 male students and one
resident assistant. Like the other ﬁrst-
year dormitories, there are 24-hour se-
curity guards in the buildings.

There are eight University buildings
located in upper campus that were de-
signed to house the brothers of Pitt’s
Greek organizations. Currently, ﬁve of
the 19 chartered fraternities in the In-
terfraternity Council each lease one fra-
ternity complex.

During the past ﬁve years, the remain-

Czechsofficials visit Czechoslovak Nationality Room

Julia Carpey
Staff Writer '

Czech politicians choked up when they
saw the words “Truth Will Prevail” in their
native tongue next to the bronze portrait
of Tomas Masaryk, the man their people
regard as a symbol of independence..

In the room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral of Learning, nestled in a wrought-
iron case by the window, is a letter by the
same man. .

“It is a very emotional room,” said E.
Maxine Bruhns, the director of Pitt’s na-
tionality rooms.

The Friday morning visit to the Czecho-
slovak Nationality Room was one stop 13
members of the Czech Republic’s gov-
ernment made in their ﬁve-day tour of
Pittsburgh last week to mark‘ the 95th an-

niversary of the Pittsburgh Agreement, ‘

which formed the state of Czechoslovakia.

The visitors included one senator and 12
members of the country’s Chamber of Com-
merce.

Masaryk, the _late philosopher, politi-
cian and professor, led the 1918 agreement,
which merged two territories inhabited
by the Czech and Slovak people into one
independent state. In 1993, the two terri-
tories peacefully divided into two separate

nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.’

Tomas Grulich, a Czech senator, said the
Pittsburgh Agreement was fundamental to
the creation of Czechoslovakia.

“It is very emotional for us because
we’ve always been a small country, ruled
by various empires, and with the Pitts-
burgh Agreement we had the ﬁrst pieces to
becoming independent,” he said through
interpreter Zdenek Hofman.

The members of the Czech delegation

[agreed that the juxtaposition of the gentle

designs within the Czechoslovak room with .

the strength of the structure mirrors the

' history of the Czech and Slovak people. The

room,‘ dedicated in 1939, features delicate
ﬂoral arrangements painted on the walls
and hand—carved accents in the wooden

chairs. V

Ruth Crawford Mitchell, the late for-
mer director and planner of the national-
ity rooms, was a close friend of Masaryk’s
daughter, Alice. Through their friendship,
the Czech and Slovak people formed a con-
nection to Pitt.

Grulich said that because of the strong
alliance with the United States, many
Czechs living in the country during the
Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia were
able to obtain the resources to return to
Czechoslovakia and help rebuild the coun-

-try.

“The 1948 Czech coup to rid Czecho-

slovakia of the Russian occupancy and
regain our independence began here in
Pittsburgh. If you go through history, all
of our triumphant events link back to the
Pittsburgh Agreement,” Grulich said.

Over the course of their ﬁve-day stay
in Pittsburgh, the visitors from the Czech
Republic attended a private lunch, a tour of
the Heinz History Center and a roundtable
discussion with members of the Allegheny
County business community.

Hofman, who translated for the mem-
bers of the Czech government during their
visit, said the tour of the Czechoslovak
room was an emotional highlight of their
stay in the United States. ,

“Czechs and Slovaks clearly played a
fundamental role in the creation and in-
dependence of Czechoslovakia, but a lot
of credit is duelto America as well,” Hof-
man said. I '

FRAT

ing fraternity buildings, including House
1, House 3,and House 9, were renovated to
accommodate ﬁrst-year students instead.
‘ Zeta Beta Tau fraternity and two
graduate dental fraternities previously
inhabited the three properties. The two
dental fraternities opted out or altered
their leases with the University and left
the buildings uninhabited. One was con-
verted in 2007 and the other in 2009,
which was the ﬁrst year that students
were housed in a fraternity building.

“I think every single one of us was
not expecting to be placed in a fraternity
house,” said James Kirwan, a freshman
resident of House 1. “I think all of us were
expecting to be placed in Towers, Suther-
land —— not the frat houses.”

Over the past decade, the total num-
ber of Pitt undergraduate and graduate

students has slowly risen. According to,

University Fact Books, the population
increased from 26,795 students in 2003
to 28,769 students in 2013.

Although Mark A. Nordenberg Hall
opened this year, the University needed
additional space to accommodate more
than 3,500 incoming ﬁrst-year students
this fall. Nordenberg Hall, located on
Fifth Avenue, provided 559 additional
beds for ﬁrst-year students.

Some redecorating was done to the
ex-fraternity complexes. The insignias
and artwork on the interior walls of the
buildings signifying Greek life had to be
painted over. The houses were furnished
with new furniture, carpeting and Pan-
ther Funds readers for the laundry fa-
cilities. . 1

Students who live in the converted
houses encounter a few inconveniences
that students who live in traditional on-
campus housing might not.

Joseph Fuoco, a freshman who lives
in House 1,,pointed..to the large room

if formerly‘ used to ‘host fraternity social '

events. .

“That room was sticky,” he said. “Just
gross in general.” .

Since the converted houses are con-
nected to on—campus fraternity houses,
freshmanjosephjavier can hear the music
played at fraternity parties on the week-

ends reverberating through his dorm’s

walls.

“Sometimes you like to jam. to [the
music], but sometimes you’re trying to
study,”Javier, who lives in House 1, said.

The unconventional living scenario
also comes with some perks. The con-
verted houses feature common areas pre-
viously used by the fraternity, including a
kitchen, functioning wet bar and expan-
sive common room. ' ,

The dorm rooms, which house‘ two
students, are also larger than the double
rooms in Towers. .

House 1 also features a big—screen tele-
vision, a foosball table and an ice cream

cooler, which residents said was presum-

. ably left by the previous inhabitants.

Gathered around the television, Kir-
win, Fuoco, Javier and other House 1resi—
dents, Billy Donner, James Cotter, Andrew
DePatie, Adam Ferg—Demopoulos, Der-
rick Kemp and Asa Walker agreed that the
positives outweigh the negatives.

” First-year students younger than 24
years old who are not military veterans
are guaranteed on—campus housing for
their freshman year if they pay the re-
quired enrollment fee and housing de-
posit by the May 1 deadline. The students,
already accepted by the University, are
required to select their top three prefer-
ences for dormitories on their housing

. applications. A

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in an
email that incoming students’ choices for
housing are “only preferences.” I

Ray Ludwig feels that the new rules
concerning Student Government Board
elections unfairly interfere with the
choices he makes outside his‘ role as
a member of SGB’s Allocations Com-
mittee. v

The Board approved four revisions
to the Elections Code on Sept. 17, and
two of the revisions prevent committee

chairs and members from publicly sup—'

porting a candidate during the Board’s
elections. Ludwig, who is a member
of SGB’s Allocations Committee, said
these revisions infringe on the com—
mittee members’ rights as students.
He presented his argument against the
revision to the Board’s.judicial Com-
mittee on Thursday night at 7 p.m. in
front of a group of six people, including
members of SGB.

Trustees outline process
for chancellor search

Parthena Moisiadis
Stajf I/Vriter

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said that he
tells students at Freshman Convocation every
year that he doesn’t want their years at Pitt

to be the best years of their lives. Instead, he _

wants them to be great years and to serve as
a platform for better years to come.
Nordenberg will not be able to share this
message with ﬁxture incoming freshman
classes; In August, he will leave his position
as chancellor. Following the announcement
of his decision at a Board of Trustees meeting
lastjune, a search began for his successor.

. “How can you ever replace Mark Norden-
berg?” asked Dawne Hickton, ‘a member of
the Chancellor Search Committee.

' Hickton reported on the committee’s ef-
forts to ﬁnd a new chancellor at a more recent
Board of Trustees meeting, which took place
10:30 a.m. Friday morning in the Assembly
Room of the William Pitt Union.

She said that the committee’s ﬁrst major
step was establishing a website for the chan-
cellor search. This website allows prospective
applicants to learn more about not only the
search, but also about the University.

The site also includes instructions and
links to nominate candidates for the posi—
tion.

In addition to the website, 14 different
public forums have been conducted in which
faculty, students and alumni discussed the
qualities they are looking for in their next
chancellor. These forums were held on Pitt’s
main campus, branch campuses and in major
cities all over the country.

Hickton said that as a result of these fo-
rums, three common themes have emerged.

The.ﬁrst is that there is an agreement that
the chancellor must retain Pitt’s commit-
ment to excellence in research. Second, the

Gish said the changes were read
aloud three times at the Board’s public
meeting on Sept. 9 in front of all the
chairs, and copies of the revisions were
available in his office while the Board
was considering them. — -

Gish also noted that the proposed,__;

revisions were published inv.i.iThe Pitt g

a decision. ' 1

Ludwig is the president of Pitt’s club
soccer team and said he uses his posi-
tion of leadership to teach underclass—
men about the election process and to
make them active in campus life. Ludwig
said that being unable to publicly sup-
port a candidate will prevent him from
being able to lead by example.

Audrey Winn, a member of,.the Ju-
dicial Review Committee, questioned
Ludwig at the meeting about what he

would do ifa candidate he was endors-
ing was caught breaking campaign rules.

Ludwig replied that he is a “normal
student’? outside of the time he devotes
to his committee, and the Board should
not haveany say over whether or not he
supports a specific candidate.

Nahja Martin, also a member of the
Judicial Review Committee, disagreed.

“Once you become a part of Student
Government Board, you represent
something bigger than yourself,” Mar-
tin said. i

leader must make efforts to keep tuition down
despite the recent inadequacies in state fund-
ing. Lastly, the new leader should possess
characteristics such as honesty and integrity.

Participants at the forums also expressed
hope for a chancellor who would value Pitt’s
culture but would also be willing to experi-
ment and try new ideas.

Hickton subsequently presented a report
to the trustees which she said outlines the
challenges and opportunities that the next
chancellor may face. The Board approved
the report.

In addition to Hickton’s remarks, Nor-
denberg presented a report that highlighted
Pitt’s recent successes in regard to student
achievement and satisfaction. Following his
presentation, the Nominating Committee
and the Property and Facilities Committee
reported. V

Clyde Jones, UPMC’s chief development
ofﬁcer, and Al Novak, Pitt’s vice chancellor
for institutional advancement, received rec-
ognition for the Building Our Future Together
campaign.

The campaign raised more than $2.13
billion from 188,000 donors, surpassing the
initial $2 billion goal that was set in 2006.
As a result of the campaign, the University
has been able to offer scholarships and fel-
lowships and undertake construction and
renovation projects.

The campaign also attracted 315 donors
who contributed more than $1 million, 28
percent of whom had never made a gift to
the school previously. Two donations were so
remarkable that they spurred the naming of
the School of Engineering and School of Arts
and Sciences in honor of their benefactors,
John A. Swanson and Kenneth P. Dietrich.I

Snapchat security: Other people may
seeyour  little pixels

Sophia Al Rasheed
.Columnz'st

Upon ﬁrst hearing about an app
that allows you to send pictures
that are only visible for ten sec-
onds, I had my doubts. An image
that is available for ten seconds
seems to give you just enough time
to mentally say, “Hey, what’s this?
Wait, what?!”

Call me pessimistic about the
often careless and extremely "self-
conﬁdent ——— or at least temporarily
self—conﬁdent —- nature of adoles-
cents, but yes, my ﬁrst question
was whether the Snapchat app was

intended for photos that would be, A

well, best if only viewed temporar-
ily. In my defense, I happened to at-
tend the school district wherev“sex—
ting” ﬁrst received both its name
and local news recognition. To me,

OPINIONS

Snapchat seemed like a resolution
to the problem of certain messages
ﬁnding their way outside of the
intended recipients — a problem
that has consequences for both
the individual and our approach
to messaging as a whole. But this
resolution can give a false sense
of security.

It seems that conversations be-
tween cell phones are something
that should be kept private. But
pictures used" in the smartphone
arena aren’t normal conversation

. material, as recent trends in the

use of explicit material indicate.
But for some, Snapchat is little

more than another form of inno—

cent entertainment, and concerns

- - about privacy are hard to come by.

“Oh my God, no! It’s not for
that!” defended my roommate,

MCT Campus

who tried to get me on board. “It’s
just a way to send funny faces to

‘ each other and keep updated with

each other.”

And boy, have the ﬁinny faces
ensued. Since the popularity of the
app, I’ve noticed multiple people
making these faces in public. If you
see someone aiming a phone to-
ward his or her face, perhaps with
double chin and/or under- or over-
exaggerated smile, you’ve probably

just witnessed someone in the act
of “snapping.”

’ It turns out, however, that my
initial assumption that Snapchat
is a cute name for a way to send
some very dirty little pixels isn’t
as crazy as it seemed, and more
people than those you intended can

see the pictures you send. A recent blog post
from the Snapchat director of operations
Micah Shaffer stated that Snapchat can view
your unopened snaps — that is, if they ref
main unviewed for up to 24 hours — under
certain circumstances, such as if a search
warrant from law enforcement is received.
There have only been about a dozen of
these warrants issued so far, but I think we
can deduce the kind of material that prompts

October 21, 2018 | The Pitt News I mmwx/.pittnevvs.eem

concern here.O
Normally, I would object to this kind of in-
fringement of privacy. In this case, the safety

policy, which bases itself on the Electronic ’

Communications Privacy Act, has good rea-
sons for implementation. Hopefully the idea
that your image could be viewed by someone
aside from the intended recipient will lower
the temptation to take explicit photos.
This isn’t the ﬁrst legal push regarding
explicit material, but rather, a consequence
of legislation already in place. The Mobile
Media Guard website, which highlights the‘

implications of sexting for each individual '

state, states that “the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania lawmakers have proposed a
law making sexting a second-degree mis-
demeanor for minors who intentionally or
knowingly record, view, possess or transmit
images of a minor (above the age of 13). en-
gaged in sexually explicit conduct.” The other

news you can ﬁnd on this particular page is '

' that there seems to be an ongoing account

V A  Policies. .

of new stories, demonstratingthat many are
still engaging in the activity despite the pos-
sible consequences, perhaps only furthering
the case for legislation. ‘ ‘

. Alf it seems like we should be embarrassed

that legislation is trying to ensure we'don’t
send naked photos to minors, it’s because we

really should be embarrassed of ourselves.
At the very least, this hobby should be kept
as discreet as possible so that we don’t'risk
having its effects cast on a younger, impres-

sionable generation and, more importantly,

so that we don’t condone an environment
in which this seems like normal behavior.

I Do yourself a favor and limit your snaps s

to the funny faces — you’re lucky there

isn’t regulation for embarrassing yourself

in public. I .

Wright continues strong preseason in Blue-Gold scrimmage win

Megan Boyle
Staff Wrz'ter

The Oakland Zoo held its first Blue and
Gold scrimmage Friday night, in which
the Gold team dominated early in the
first half to secure a 74-67 victory over
the Blue team. The scrimmage was the
second in the Pitt men’s basketball pre-
season, following the Blue and Gold
game played as-a part of the Maggie
Dixon Heart Health Fair a few weeks
ago.

“We do this to thank the Zoo for all
of their support and everything they’ve
done for us,” head coach Jamie Dixon
said.

Redshirt junior guard Cameron
Wright and redshirt senior small for-
ward Lamar Patterson contributed
heavily to the Gold team win by rack-

- ing up 25 points apiece in the contest.

Both players took advantage at the free-
throw line, as Wright went 10—for-12 and
Patterson 12-for—13, aiding in the team’s
83—percent scoring rate at the line.
This is the second scrimmage in
which Wright scored more than 20
points, following his performance that
culminated in a game-winning 3—pointer
in the Blue and Gold scrimmage. Last
season Wright ﬂew under the radar next

“He’s just a better player,” Dixon
said. “He’s in better shape, and he’s
shooting the ball with more arc. We’re

pretty certain he’s going to have a really
good year.”

Along with Wright and Patterson,
five other players scored in the double
digits, including freshmen Michael

The defensive stop put the Panthers
(4-2, 2-2 ACC) in control for the ﬁnal

which keyed Saturday’s 35-24 win over
Old Dominion (4-3) after the Monarchs
led 10-0 heading into the second quar-
ter.

“Third down, wecall it {money

get off the field on third down as far

as momentum goes.” ,
And Pitt was money on third down

' Saturday, as the stop halted any mo-

BENNETT

It was this positive mindset and the abil-
ity to just go with the flow that allowed
Bennett to dominate Old Dominion on
Saturday evening.

On a night when the Panthers needed
the running game to work because red-

shirt senior quarterback Tom‘ Savage, 1

who had suffered the painful aftermath
of sacks the past two games, was not on
his A game. And, with Conner out for
the, game with a shoulder injury, the

_ majority of the» carries were likely to
T go to Bennett.

But not even Bennett imagined a
workload of 30 carries.

“Honestly, I wasn’t prepared to run
the ball that many times,” said the
Tulsa, Okla., native. .“I don’t even re-
member the last time I ran the ball 30
times in a game.” i

But it wasn’t only the workload
that stuck out on the final stat line for
Bennett. It was what he did with that
workload ‘that became the highlight
of the night for the Panthers. Bennett
compiled 240 yards rushing and three
touchdowns on those 30 carries en
route to a 35-24 victory over. Old Do-
minion. He became the first Pitt player
to rush for 200 yards in a game since
Ray Graham did so in 2011 and rushed
for the most in a game since Dion Lewis
ran for 261 against Cincinnati in 2010.

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst was short

and sweet in his analysis of Bennett’s
performance, saying, “Isaac ran the ball
well. He ran the ballhard. It was good
to see.” He also added that “the guys
up front worked their tail off for that
to happen.” A

After the game, Bennett was quick
to give credit to his offensive line as
well. “My eyes got pretty big seeing all
those holes they made,” said Bennett.
“They got about as big as those holes.”

Savage, who again struggled to ﬁnd
a rhythm in the passing-game, throwing
for only 104 yards and a touchdown,
lauded Bennett post game as well.
“[Bennett] is just the type of guy you
want to have on your team,” said the
Panthers’ senior quarterback. “With
James coming out doing what he did, a
lot of juniors would just put their head
down. But he always has a smile on his
face. It couldn’t have happened to a bet-
ter person.”

While the numbers should be taken
with a grain of salt, as Old Dominion’s
defense is notoriously porous, Ben-
nett’s performance was a step in the
right direction for a running game that
has struggled to get going early on the
past two games.

With Conner possibly returning next
week for Pitt’s road matchup against
Navy, Bennett’s workload will likely
diminish despite his monstrosity of a
game.

But he isn’t concerned because for
him, “it’s all about the team.” 3

tragic on third-and-long,” Vinopal said.
“Overall you’Ve gotta win third—down
battles. I think that was the key to our
success today.”

 

Vinopal ﬁnished as the game’s lead— _

ing tackler at seven stops next to his
pass defense and interceptionlater in
the fourth quarter.

The Panthers improved as the game
progressed after the Monarchs con-
verted 3—of-5 third downs in the first
quarter ,pulling out to a 10-0 lead. But
Vinopal and the defense focused in to
hold Old Dominion to 2-of-10 on third
down over the rest of the game, includ-
ing a 0-for-4 mark in the fourth quarter.

“We just went back to the bench, and
everyone was saying that we’ve gotta get
it together,” Vinopal said. “We’re get-
ting these guys first and second down,
we’re playing great downs of defense,
we can’t let it all go to waste on third.”

While the defense improved its play
on third down, the offense scored three

halftime. Isaac Bennett scored all three
and helped keep thelPanthers’ offense
moving all game despite a lackluster
performance from the passing game.
Offensively, Pitt ﬁnished 4-of—10 on
third downs to out—perform the Mon-
archs this week. The victory over Old
Dominion follows a week in which No.
24 Virginia Tech won the third—down
battle and, in turn, beat Pitt 19-9.
While Pitt executed well on third
downs, the Panthers’ drives didn’t re-
sult in many crucial third-down situa-

' tions as Bennett kept the ball moving.

Bennett rushed 30 times for a career-
high 243 yards and three touchdowns.

“If the running game is good, it’s
able to open up the passing game, and
today therunning game was real good,
and Tom.was able to make a play to

Manasseh {Garner] one of the times,”

Bennett said. “It just balanced out a lot.
