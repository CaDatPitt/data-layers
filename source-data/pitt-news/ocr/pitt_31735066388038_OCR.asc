MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1939

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Chris Studebaker
For The Pitt News

At a demonstration held last
Friday in front Of the City—County
building, the president of an
organization of parents involved
in divorce cases accused the
judges in the Family Division
Courts of “blatant deprivation of

. constitutional rights.”

The purpose of the
demonstration, which lasted from
11 a.m. to 2 p.m., was to “correct
injustices of the Family Courts,”
said Doug Martin, the president
of Access to Justice. Martin said
that Access to Justice is a “Pro-
Farnily” group, whose main
concern is for the preservation of
the family and the fair treatment
of the children involved in custody
cases.

According to Frank Valentich,
treasurer of Access to Justice and
a University of Pittsburgh
employee, the demonstration was
for many reasons, including to
help those Pitt students facing
similar difficulties with the Family
Courts.

Valentich, who operates a
machine shop in Crawford Hall,
and the other members of the
group have cases pending in the
Family Courts, which handle
divorce and custody hearings.

Valentich, who is trying to win
custody of his two children, said
that the way his case has been
handled in the courts is unfair.
Valentich was accused by his
wife of child molestation and the
courts took the children away
from him. Valentich had a
different psychologist evaluate his

children because he felt court-
appointed psychologist Neil
Rosenblum did a poor job. The
second evaluation came back and
the psychologist said that there
was no implied sexual
molestation. Valenti-ch said that
the courts have been biased since
the accusations made byhis wife,
and this has hindered his chances
of getting custody.

Doug Martin has tried dealing
with the officials in the Family
Courts, but “they keep blowing
us off,” he said. He alleges that
the judges, lawyers and the court
psychologists are biased and not
doing their jobs.

An administrator for the Family
Courts, Gary Stout, said the
Pittsburgh Family Courts are “the
most respehted Family Courts in
the Commonwealth of

W5

VOLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE NINETEEN

Custody rights group accuses Family Court judges

Pennsylvania.”

Stout said he has never heard
of Access tojustice and has never
been approached by its members
to discuss their problems with
the Courts. Stout said that the
groups’ accusations against the
judges are unfounded and that
these judges are the best at ‘what
they do.

Both Martin and Valentich
criticized‘Rosenblum. Martin said
Rosenblum is “incompetent and
not interested in the welfare of
the children involved in cases."

According to Gary Stout, “Neil
Rosenblum is the most competent
psychologist the court uses.” Stout
added that Rosenblum, who could
not be reached for comment,/is
“highly regarded by‘ his peers,”
and that Martin's accusations
could not be further from the

truth.

Valentich -said that one of his
main concerns is that there is “fair
treatment” for the parents, and
especially the children involved
in divorce cases. Valentich said
he hopes that his group's actions
will help those children who are
caught in the middle of custody
disputes, because “the children
are the ones. that are affected the
most.‘ ’ ,

After the demonstration, Martin
said he was pleased with the

turnout and that more events are

planned. Martin criticized the
media, saying they were “covering
up for the judges,” and that his
group was not taken seriously by
them. Martin added that the group
will focus their future
demonstrations on the judges,
and will continue to protest.

First student-created recruitment offers scholarships

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Twenty~six high school seniors
competed for $12,000 in scholarship
money last Friday in the first ever
recruitment effort initiated and organized
by Pitt students.

“This is the first time we’ve had a
recruitment program where two students
came up with an idea and followed
through to make it a reality, " Betsy Porter,
director of admissions, said. ’

Nathan Urban, a junior, and Kristen
Zagst, a sophomore said that they got the
idea for the program when they attended
the National Collegiate Honors

Conference last October. Zagstis pursuing
a major in behavioral neuroscience,
history and philosophy of science and
chemistry with a biology option. Urban’s
major is behavioral neuroscience and
philosophy of math.

“One of the sessions was about how to
get able, motivated students to come to
your school. We realized that was a major
problem here at Pitt,” Zagst said.

Urban and Zagst submitted a proposal
to the admissions office when they
returned and were granted approval and
funds to organize a program which selects
high school juniors with high PSAT scores
from the surrounding Pittsburgh areas.

The six two—thousand-dollar

scholarships that were offered were not
based on need and will be awarded on
the basis of performance on a four-
question -essay test which Urban wrote.
The tests will be evaluated by graduate

, students. ‘

“This is not like any test that they [have
ever] taken before,” Urban said. “There
are two math—type questions and two
humanities and literature questions on
the test. Each student only has to answer
two questions. The scholarships will be
weighted in a way so that those who
answer one question from each section
will be awarded more money. We are
looking for kids who are well— rounded. ”

The students spent two days at Pitt and

Partying like mad...

TV on Dawson Street in Oakland.

stayed with students from the University
Honors College who volunteered to be
their hosts.

“Our purpose is to show these kids the
things that you can't see in a brochure,”
Zagst said.

‘Peter Anso, senior at Kane Area High
School, said that the program provided
him with a good chance to talk to students
about their classes and activities at Pitt.

“It gives me a chance to experience Pitt
firsthand,” Anso said.

One of the main events that the students
attended was a dinner at the Holiday Inn
where several honors students and

Abortion foes ‘tar’ clinic

Paul Diamond/ The Pitt News

By Linda Marie Micco 0
Staff Writer

Early Saturday morning,
employees at Women’s Health
Services in the Fulton Building
Downtown busily prepared for a
typical Saturday. As usual,
picketers standing outside told
incoming patients that the clinic
was closed in an attempt to keep
them from entering the building.
At 7:40 a.m., after 65 patients had
signed in for procedures, six anti-
abortion activists forced their way
into the downtown clinic.
Positioning themselves in the
hallway in front of the procedure
room doors, they secured their
bare feet in buckets of liquid
roofing tar and linked their elbows
to form a human chain.

“They pushed past one of our
staff members as she was coming
in to work,” said Sue Roselle,
executive director at Women’s
Health Services.
An employee immediately called

llN§I[lDlEg Pitt News Photo Essay, page 9

security, but when the police
arrived, the activists passively
resisted by making their bodies
limp, causing gallons of tar to be
spilled on the tiled ﬂoors.

“They were standing in buckets S

that must have been specially
devised. It was very painful [for
the activists] to be manipulated
out of the buckets,” said an
employee who asked not to be
identiﬁed.

“They were wearing regular street
clothes," she said. “They didn’t
look like‘ they were traveling
incognito. They looked like a
younger group than the normal

middle-aged antiéchoice people ,

that are usually at the rallies.”
After the Pittsburgh Police arrested
the six activists, the staff at
Women’s Health Services offered
the patients additional counseling
to help them deal with the incident
and the option to reschedule their
appointments.

Counseling offered to suicidal

By Marcy Lightfoot
and Scott Helkowski
For The Pitt News

Nearly 1,000 needless deaths
occur annually on college
campuses due to suicide.

“Suicide is the second leading
cause of death among college
students and the seventh leading
cause of death nationally,”
according to Dr. Robert
Gallagher, director of the
Counseling and Student
Development Center at Pitt.
However, he added, “the suicide
rate at Pitt is extremely low
compared to other college
campuses nationwide.”

A random survey of 1,800 Pitt
students conducted in 1988 by
the Counseling and
Development Center, revealed

WE _that approximately seven
Clou dy W1 th showers percent of those surveyed had
Highs in the mid_.70s experienced suicidal feelings.

Although many college
students have mild bouts with
depression, it is usually only
temporary, often resulting from
failing grades, unsuccessful
relationships and homesickness,
said Gallagher.

He encourages those students
experiencing mild depression
to talk with a friend or counselor
about their feelings. Involvement
in campus activities, he said,
could also help take their minds
off their problems.‘

Severe depression, on the
other hand, is long-term and
can include any of the following
symptoms: difficulty in sleeping,
feeling fatigued, irritability, loss
of appetite, frequent crying,
unwillingness to communicate
and feelings of inadequacy.

according to Gallagher.

The Pitt Counseling and

psychologists available to give
conﬁdential help to needy
individuals.

In addition to counseling
services, the center also provides
suicide prevention training for
resident assistants, academic

Students experiencing

Pitt environmental  
P group starts crusade

By Jacinta Dvorak
and Karen Speece
The Pitt News

Continuing their efforts to save
the environment, members of
Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now, a
newly formed group at the
University of Pittsburgh, went to
Ligoneer this weekend to pick
up the trash at a road stop on
Route 50.

About fifteen Pitt students
participated in the effort. In a
1OO—sIquare-foot area in the
woods, the group was able to
pick up so many full trash bags
they were not able to put them
all into the trunks of their cars
and had to put some in local
dumpsters instead of hauling
them back to designated sites in
the Oakland area.

“We are in a position now that
we can alter what’s been done
to our environment," according
to Lou Fineberg, co-chairman of
the recycling committee. “In
another 20 years or so, we won’t
be able to do what we can
now.”

Members of C.L.E.A.N are
divided, into five committees:
recycling, activities, education,
newsletter and SWAT (Students

With Aggressive Tendencies).
Each of these groups has a
spokesperson, but according to
Traci Darin, chairwoman of the
newsletter committee, “There’s
no hierarchy. The group as a

Swhole decides what action to

take.”

One of the group’s main
concerns is recycling. Darin said,
“People are becoming more
aware of the fact that our
resources will be gone all too
soon. [Recycling] can work here.
It has worked in other states.
People want to recycle.

“Right now we’re dealing with
the Recycling Act 101, which is

going to go into effect soon. We _

want to promote curbside
recycling,” Darin said. “People
have a habit of thoughtlessly
throwing things away.”
According to Darin, “IThe
group] is up on all the
environmental issues. It’s not
just a fad anymore, the way it
was in the ’60s; it’s a matter of
life now. We will have a positive
effect on the environment.”
Fineberg also feels that the
group will be effective. “Within
the next few weeks, we’ll be
putting out blue and gold cans
with the Pitt emblem and the

Tar

(3,, Continued from page 1
Appointments were delayed less
than 30 minutes, according to
Roselle, and not one of the 65
patients rescheduled. Patients
were led through a storage closet
so they would not have to walk

‘ over the black sticky mess.
“It was a bit hectic, but we’re
open and on schedule," Roselle
, said four hours after the incident.
Maintenance workers in the
building draped sheets of
cardboard over the tar covered
ﬂoors attempting to contain the
mess and turned the heat down
to prevent the tar from giving off
harmful fumes until a disaster-
cleaning service couldarrive on

T! the scene.

Women's Health Services will

   

have to use some of its own
funds to pay for the cleanup
which will probably involve
installation of new ﬂoors, costing
thousands of dollars.

“We are in the middle of a fund-
raising week,” Roselle said.
“Instead of spending the money
to provide health care for women,
we'll have to spend it to clean up
after these terrorists.”
According to spokeswoman
Barbara Page, Operation Rescue
did not organize, sponsor, or
take part in the the tarring incident
at Women’s Health Services.
However, she did not disapprove
of the action.

“If there was one baby saved, I’m
sure it was worth it,” Page said of
the tarring.

‘Forty Pittsburgh college
students, including 20 from Pitt,

' joined an estimated 6,000 pro-

choice advocates who rallied on
the steps of the Pennsylvania
State Capitol building last
Tuesday.

NOW president Molly Yard
and NOW state president Chris

One Pitt student who attended
the rally was Deborah Gould,
president of the Campus
Women’s Organization.

“There were about 20 Pitt
students and 20 students from
other nearby colleges, which
was better than we expected
because it was a weekday,” said
Gould. There were also seven
buses from Pittsburgh.

Gould felt there was some
optimism in the speeches. “There
was a feeling that we can't let

But she also said that it was

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 2, 1989

Students unaware of STD risks

By Melinda Holben
For The Pitt News

It was not long ago that
discussions of sexual
relationships and the problems

' that they sometimes incur were

saved for locker rooms, slumber
parties, and sex education classes
taught by awkward and
embarrassed gym teachers.

But in recent‘ years, life
threatening and indeed life
ending sexually transmitted

_ diseases, STDs, have stiﬂed the

laughter that had once been
associated with a case of the
clap and have brought sex out
of the closet.

AIDS, Acquired Immune
Deﬁciency Syndrome, the most
serious of STDs, has taken center
stage in research and prevention
education. One can scarcely pick
up a newspaper or magazine
without reading a headline article
about the spread of this deadly
disease, and in every article, the
same information is drilled into
the readers’ heads: use condoms
during sex to prevent the spread
of AIDS; do not share
intravenous needles; AIDS is not
spread through casual contact,
etc. I

Once again the seriousness of
“the clap” is being downplayed
as its effects pale in comparison
to the fatal AIDS virus. However,
the less serious diseases are far
more widespread among college

, coeds, and although they usually

do not result in the death of the
patient, STDs like gonorrhea (the
clap), syphilis and chlamydia
pose very serious health threats
if left undetected or untreated.
For example, chlamydia, said

by experts to be the most
prevalent STD, affecting 10-15
percent of the student population
in any year, can lead to infertility
in men and women if it is not
detected and treated in time.

Chlamydia is the biggest STD
on the University of Pittsburgh
campus, according to Frank
Carter, director of Student
Health. “When we say
‘chlamydia,’ many students think
we are talking about a ﬂower,”
he said.

Symptoms of chlamydia may
include bleeding between
periods or after intercourse,
abdominal pain, or burning
urination. However, since 75
percent of those infected with
this disease never experience‘
symptoms and have no idea that
they are infected, they

unknowingly pass it on to their

partners.

Often the only way the
infection can be detected is
through screening usually done
by a gynecologist. “For the last
two years, [Pitt] has been
routinely screening patients of
the Forbes Clinic for chlamydia, "
said Dr. Pamela A. Bowen, the
Student Health medical
administrator. Forbes Clinic is a
free gynecology and family
planning service made available
to students through the Student
Health fee. “If these tests are
done by doctors outside the
university, it can cost up to $70,”
she added.

In the last four weeks already
20 cases of chlamydia have been
diagnosed through screening at
the clinic.

“I went to Forbes Clinic for my
regular gyne examination, and

found out that I had chlamydia, ”
said one woman. “At first I was
really upset, but after I found
out how serious it can be, I was
very glad that I found out and
had it taken care of.”

Perhaps the second biggest
STD among college students is
Genital Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) Disease, more commonly
known as genital warts.
According to a report issued last
April by the American College
Health Association, the number
of clinical visits at American
universities for genital warts has
increased by over 500 percent
in the past 15 years.

“When I started here, I had
hardly heard of genital warts or
herpes,” said Dr. Bowen, “but
now it has reached epidemic
proportions.”

Genital warts were once
thought of as inconvenient and
embarrassing but not particularly
threatening, the report said.
However, as the rate of infection
has skyrocketed among college
students, the significance of HPV
as a cause of cancer is becoming
increasingly clear. ’

The major difference between
these two widespread STDs is in
their treatments. Chlamydia,
syphilis and gonorrhea can all
be treated and cured with
prescribed antibiotics. Genital
warts. and herpes, as well as
AIDS, can be treated and toan
extent controlled but cannot be
cured. s ’

Warts can be removed with
chemicals, liquid nitrogen, laser
beam, or in some cases surgery.
“The worst thing about having
genital warts,” said one infected

student, “is that you have to
keep going to the doctor for
treatments until [the warts] are
all gone. It is really humiliating
because you feel like the doctor
must think you are dirty or
sleazy.”

According to Dr. Bowen, this

A student is not alone, as “there

seems to be no end to these
infections.” ‘
Another student with genital
warts reinforced this opinion, “I
know at least ﬁve other people
who have it too; anyone can get
it. The main thing is to go and
have them removed as soon as
possible before they get out of
control or become dangerous.”
Unfortunately, what is true of
chlamydia can also be true of
genital warts in that some
patients do not have any visible
symptoms and only discover
their inﬂiction after a visit to the
doctor. I
Genital herpes is also
incurable, but acyclovir capsules
or ointment can be very helpful.

“The use of acyclovir has been a
real breakthrough," said Bowen.
“There are no side effects, and
treatments can reduce the
outbreak period to two thirds.”
Doctors and clinicians at Forbes
have also been advising their
patients to use A spermicides
containing non-oxynol 9 once a
week, as they have been shown,
although not proven, to kill the
herpes virus. .

Also, according to a pamphlet
published by the ACHA titled
“What Are Sexually Transmitted
Diseases?” the frequency of

recurrence of the virus can be;

controlled by proper diet, rest
and exercise, and as studies have

I linked stress to outbreaks, stress

levels should be kept low as
well.

A student who has been
diagnosed at Forbes Clinic as
being infected with herpes said,
“I had no idea how I could have
gotten it. My partner and I had
had a monogamous relationship
for over a year when I got sick.

. Thenl found out that oral herpes

can be transmitted to the genitals
through oral sex, and that is
how we got it.”

“In Pittsburgh,” Dr. Bowen

» said, “50 percent of all cases of

genital herpes is Type I. I guess
we like oral sex in Pittsburgh.”

It is no big surprise that these
diseases are spread through
sexual contact. “Through sex
rather than sexual intercourse is
the best way to put it," said Dr.
Bowen, “because these diseases
can be transmitted by male-
female and male—male , as well
as female-female sexual
relationships.”

Since it is obvious that no one
is safe from ST Ds, and it is
unlikely that sexual activity is
going to stop, the smart thing to
do is play it safe. The Pitt Program
Council and the Student Health
Service are joining forces to
present Pitt students with the
facts about how to have safer
sex. “We are not encouraging
anyone to have sex,” said Andrea
Marceca, chairwoman of the PPC
Leisure Learning Committee that

is co-sponsoring the October 4
event called Protect Yourself.
“It’s just that we are realistic
enough to know that many
students are already having sex,
and we want to teach them to be
responsible about it.”

In addition to practicing safer
sex, it is becoming more and
more important for all sexually
active women and men to have
regular medical examinations,
including the STD screening that
is offered free of charge to all
Pitt students.

With the perils sexy involves
for today’s college coeds,_
practicing safer sex, being able
to know when something is
wrong with our bodies and
seeing a doctor at least once a
year, are imperative if the spread
of these diseases is to be brought
under control.

Maybe the clap used to be
funny, but times have changed,
and taking the threat of these
diseases seriously is now amatter
of life and death.

Stewart spoke. Most of the
speakers emphasized the
opportunities that a large
university like Pitt can hold.

“I did things as a freshman.

here that I don't think would
have been possible at a small,
selective liberal. arts school, “
Zagst said as she addressed the
students.

While Zagst spoke about the
research opportunities she had,
others talkedabout study abroad
programs and extracurricular
activities. After the dinner there
was a question-and—answer
session where many of the
students voiced their concerns
about the competitiveness of
Pitt graduates in the graduate
school selection process.

“The fact is that graduates .

from the Honors College can

compete on the same level as a A

Chi.ldishn ess is no answer

While 20 demonstrators marched peacefully outside
Womerfs Health Services Inc., six others (not so peace-
fully) entered the facility and poured 25 gallons of tar all
over the floor.

The demonstrators, splattered with tar, were arrested
and taken to the Zone 1/ North Side police station. They
refused to give their names, thereby-_ preventing their
being processed and released. -

It was their intention to close the clinic, however, all
they succeeded in doing was causing damage to the

E facility itself. The tar. was dumped onto the ﬂoors,

splattered on the walls and tracked along the beige
carpets lining the clinic. S

Shop-owners were not particularly happy with the
demonstrators’ presence outside of their businesses
either. It is not good for. business to have protestors
outside of your store, especially ones who were de-

scribed by Cmdr. Herman Mitchell as “a lot more

aggressive” than usual.

Regardless of whether abortion is right or wrong, good
or bad —— what right do these protestors have to destroy
someone else’s property? If they really are proud to be
demonstratingin such a childish fashion, then why do
they not stand tall and state their names to the police,
instead of refusing identification? ‘

In America, it is everyone’s right to protest what they
do not believe in —— as long as it is peaceful. Tactics such
as spraying tar everywhere and sitting under buses to
keep them from carrying demonstrators away are not
included in these rights. It is sad that this issue could
cause “sensible” adults to resort to childish yictions in
order to get their point across.

Pro-lifers and pro-choicers alike’ have every right to
hold their opinion. They have every right to express their
opinion. They do not have the right to force others to
listen to their opinion by employing tacticsrthat can harm
or damage someone or something.

Letter to the Editor

I was shocked and amazed to

Police Blotter of September 18th!
Imagine —-S a female student
becoming loud and disorderly
after receiving an unfavorable
reply to her question at the
Office of Admissions and Finan-
cial Aid! What a surprise! ~
Perhaps she had stood in line
for an hour at the cashier’s office
in order to pay her bill, only to
find that, due to a “computer
error," her Guaranteed Student
Loan hadn’t come through. [...]
I was not shocked and amazed
to find that a girl had flipped,

just surprised that the rest of the
students in line didn't rise up in
their collective anger and storm
the nearest administrative of-
fice, filled with resentment for
time wasted in line after line.
Enough is enough. Until the
ridiculously inefficient systems
at this “World Class University"

are overhauled (things have.

gone too awry for mere stream-
lining), there may be more
scenes involving crazed co-eds.
And next time, things may get
ugly (er).

Legal definition of drunkeness needs no

change .

Approximately one month
ago, the governor of Pennsylva-
nia, Robert Casey, proposed
legislation that would lower the
level of legal drunkenness while
driving from .10 percent to .08
percent. While I do not con-
done driving while under the

inﬂuence (D.U.I.), I do feel that ‘

lowering the legal limit from .10
percent to .08 percent is agreat
error. With Pennsylvania already

having some of the strictest, if -

not the strictest laws .. against
drunk driving in America, there
is no need for further tightening
of those laws to a point of stran-
gulation. The system as
it stands now is an effective one,
and it has stood the test of time
for at least the last five years.
Some people may think that
because they never drink and
drive, changing the law would
have no impact on them. How-
ever, a reduction of the level of
legal drunkenness could be a
very unnecessary expense.

Educating the public about I

the new limit would cost money,
which is sure to come from the
taxpayers’ pockets. There would
be certain costs involved with
advertising, aimed at the public,
to alert them of the important
and significant changes in the
law.

With a lower legal limit, it
will be more difficult to ascer-
tain whether or not a person is
legally beyond this limit. Thus,
more breatholyser and blood
tests must be given — and the

equipment to perform these tests

is not free.
In addition, the lower legal
limit would cause more people

V to be arrested for D.U.I. Consid-

ering the amount of money spent
on imprisoning murderers and
rapists in terribly over-crowded
facilities, do we really want to
spend even more money hous-
ing the great quantity of legally
drunk people that are bound to
arise from a change in laws?
About ten years ago, the D.U.I.
laws in this state were not par-
ticularly tough. It might have
taken four to six D.U.I. convic-

tions before someone would
really find themselves in any
kind of trouble with the law.
Then Mothers Against‘ Drunk
Driving (M.A.D.D.) got involved.
After fervent lobbying across
Pennsylvania for a couple of
years, incredibly strict D.U.I. laws
were passed in this state in 1984.

In accordance with those laws,
the term “due process” no longer
had any legal meaning or appli-
cation when dealing with inci-
dents of drinking and driving.
That is, no matter what aspects
of police procedure were vio-

 

lated during a D.U.I. arrest, the
charges would stick. A drug
dealer, however, whose rights
were violated through a due
process technicality was let go
by the courts.

Those strict laws have really
had an impact on D.U.I. cases in

this state. They have increased.

steadily and rapidly since 1984.

» However, to deal with the dras-

tic increase in D.U.I. convic-
tions, the state came up with the
Accelerated Rehabilitative Dis-
position (A R.D.) program to give
first-time offenders a chance for
rehabilitation, probation and an
opportunity to agree to certain
requirements — in exchange
for an eventually expunged
charge of D.U.I. That is, if one
follows certain guidelines and
agrees to certain regulations,
then the D.U.I. charge is re-

'moved from one’s record.

With the legal drunkenness
level at .10 percent, the average
male person (160 pounds) is

’ under the inﬂuence after drink-

ing approximately ﬁve drinks in
an hour. To most people, that
may seem to be relatively few
drinks to be considered legally
drunk, but let’s assume that it’s
perfectly reasonable and fair.
There are quite a few business-
men out there who return to

so far, the system works fine

work at about 1:00 p.m. after a
business lunch that included
several very nice, dry martinis.
By this standard, it is fortunate
that most of them walk to and
from lunch. If the legal blood
alcohol» content (B.A.C.) is low-
ered to .08 percent, then a 160
pound person is drunk after
four drinks.

This is an unnecessary change
in the laws, and it would only
serve to increase the‘-work of
police forces across Pennsylva-
nia in enforcing D.U.I. In addi-

tion, the number of people who »

would either be charged with
D.U.I. or qualify for the A.R.D.
program would vastly increase.

So why is Governor Casey
proposing this new legislation?
M.A.D.D. hasn't been pushing
for a lower legal B.A.C., level,
and there haven't been any

In two years, a new governor

The .08.percent B.A.C. may be
Governor Casey’s way of pick-
ing and sticking to an issue
throughoutthe whole campaign.
Perhaps he’s attempting to
appeal to certain groups within
society to win their votes. Nev-
ertheless, an .08 percent B.A.C.

D.U.I. suspects could cause

jeopardy whenever a social

The current B.A.C. is essen-
tially the accepted legal limit for
drinking and driving across
America, much like twenty-one
is the legal drinking age. It is not
necessary for Pennsylvania to
be one of the only states to have
a lower legal limit. The present
system is, for the most part, very
successful. A system that has
proven itself successful over
several years need not be
changed on the whim of Gover-
nor Robert Casey.

Like kissin' yer sister...

Editor in Chief

MORGANT OWN, W.Va. — The
record books will forever show
that the Pitt Panthers and West
Virginia Mountaineers played to
a“ 51-31 tie on September 30,

“1989.

But the Mountaineer Field
record crowd of 68,938 and a
national viewing audience who
saw the game on ESPN can attest
that it was the Panthers who
came out of Morgantown with a
victory.

Trailing 31-9 at the beginning
of the fourth quarter, the Panthers
rallied behind the arm of redshirt
freshman quarterback Alex Van
Pelt for three touchdowns and a
l2—yard field-goal by Ed Frazier
and as time expired kept No. 10
Pitt ‘unbeaten at 3-0-1.

While ninth-ranked WVU didn’t
lose, it saw its 17—game regular
season winning streak, dating to
the final two games of 1987,
snapped. The Mountaineers

 yecord now stands at 4-O-1.

 “I’1l tell you what, it looked

if

grim there towards the beginning
of the fourth quarter,” said Van
Pelt, who threw two first-half
interceptions and completed only
five of 18 passes for 108 yards at
the half. “But we had it in us. We
knew if we were going to do it,
we knew we could.

“This game is seen as a victory
in‘-*»our hearts and minds for the
way we came back,” he added.

Van Pelt rebounded in the
second half, completing 20 of 32
passes for 258 yards, including
164 yards in the fourth quarter,
and a touchdown strike to Henry
Tuten. He did throw two more
interceptions, however.

Van Pelt had the third-highest
efficiency rating in the nation

prior to the game based on his 76
percent completion statistic. The
first half made it seem as if he had
been playing on borrowed time
for the first three Pitt victories,
but his resiliency was the key to
the Panther victory.

“This is a hard crowd to come
play in front of,” said Pitt center/
guard Dean Caliguire. “All I have
to say about Alex’s performance
is at the end of the game he was
cool as hell, and he came back
and got us the tie, and that keeps
us out of the loss column and still
keeps us alive for everything and
all the goals we have set for us.”

For three quarters it seemed
that Panthers were not a top—10—
caliber team. Their nine‘ points
were one less than they scored in
a 51-10 loss at Pitt Stadium last
season when the Mountaineers
went on to play Notre Dame for
the national championship. The

first half belonged to the

Mountaineers as Major Harris
passed for three touchdowns. The

third quarter also saw the’

Mountaineers maintain control.
WVU’s Brad Carroll converted a
20-yard field goal at 6:40, and
Rico Tyler caught a 4-yard
weakside pass from Harris at 4:06.
The Carroll PAT gave WVU their
31 points and 22-point lead.

The Panthers opened the fourth
quarter at their own 45-yard line.
Five minutes and 40 seconds later,
tailback Adam Walker vaulted
over the WVU defensive line for
a 2-yard touchdown. A two—point
conversion attempt failed, and
‘the Mountaineers led 31-15 with
9:20 to play.

West Virginia ran just over two
minutes off the clock before
tailback Eugene Napoleon, a
senior transfer from Pitt, fumbled

on his own 39 and the Panthers

Last-quczrter comeback saves Pittfozce in 31-31 tie with WVU  

 

Heidi R. White/T he Pitt News

WVU's Preston Waters picked-off two Alex Van Pelt passes during Saturday's Pitt-WVU game
in Mountaineer ﬁeld. Van Pelt eventually calmed down and led the,Panthers to four fourth
quarter scores in the 31-31 tie.

Scoring droughtresults in weekend tie to Ohio State

Pf Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team recorded a win and .

a tie last week beating Geneva on
Wednesday 1-0 at Geneva and playing
Ohio State for a 1-1 tie at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday. The soccer team’s record is now
4-5-1.

The Panthers continued their goal-
scoring drought, scoring only one goal
against a Geneva squad that looked like
they should never have been in the game.
Coach Joe Luxbacher’s reaction after the
win sounded more like the Panthers were
soundly beaten.

“We did not play well," said Luxbacher.
“As a team we played poorly.” '

Pitt dominated the first half, controlling
the ball on the ground and able to win

, mdst loose balls and even winning balls

6 controlled by Geneva players. Most of the
first half was played in the Geneva end of
the field.

Pitt scored the garne-winner four minutes
into the game. Midﬁelder Heinz Pak passed
a ball from the left corner. The ball hit a
defender and bounded high in the air.
Panther attackers Mike Blatz and Mark
Brehm were able to get to the crossing
pass. Both players jumped along with
Geneva goalkeeper Mike Venanzi. Blatz
somehow outjumped Venanzi, heading
the ball into the net;

“I guess I timed my jump a little better
(than Venanzi),” said Blatz.

Geneva showed some life in the second
half, mounting potentially dangerous
attacks. However, they were either stood
up by the Panther defenders or rnisplayed
their own passes.

Panther goalkeeperjay Kapusta recorded
the first Panther shut-out of the season,
but he was never really tested. The Golden

Tornadoes were able to whip up only one «

shot on goal.
“We didn’t have many chances,” said
Luxbacher. “I’m at a loss as to why.”

“This was probably our worst effort (this
year),” added Blatz.

Blatz has been this team's offensive
savior, scoring six of ten Panther goals this
year.

The Panthers have been playing without
senior co—captain Sam Lanza who sprained
his knee in practice two weeks ago. His
status is day-to-day.

Also on the Panthers injured list are
senior midﬁelder Marc Mostinckx and

, sophomore forwards Mark Brehm and Al

Lopus. Mostinckx aggravated a previous
groin injury against Geneva causing him
to leave the game and miss the Ohio State
game. Brehm had to leave both games
early. Brehm has been trying to recover
from the ﬂu. He ran out of breath early in
both games. Lopus also left the Ohio State
game earlybecause of the ﬂu.

On Saturday, Pitt and Ohio State played
a hard-fought 0-0 tie in regulation.

In the first overtime period, the Ohio
State faced a madman in’ goal. The

Buckeyes had a number of scoring chances
only to be stoned by Panther keeper Jay
Kapusta. Ohio State’s David Cass took a
couple of loose balls sending a hard drive
on Kapusta both times. Kapusta leaped
and got a hand on the first shot The
second shot, about a minute later, got by
Kapusta but smacked the crossbar and
was cleared by a Panther defender.

Late in the same overtime period, Ohio
State threatened again. A Buckeye
midfielder sent the ball to the right corner.
The ball went too far for Buckeye midﬁelder
Paul Howard, but the ball hit the corner
ﬂag and bounced back to Howard. Howard
made a centering pass that hit off a defender
to Buckeye Peter Moore standing alone
five yards in front of the goal. His shot was
miraculously saved by Kapusta.

The rebound came back to Moore who
passed to Buckeye Todd Young. His shot
was also turned away by Kapusta. By this
time there was too much chaos in front of

Frazier's heroics settle some fears on

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

MORGANT OWN, W.Va. - The Panthers’ kicking
game has often been an area of frustration for
their fans over the last few years. In 1986, Pitt
kickers made just 11 of 20 field goal attempts,
and only 10 of 23 attempts split the uprights in
1987. Last year, Pitt thought they found the
answer in Scott Kaplan, who made 66.7 percent
of his boots in 1988.

Kaplan lost the job this year to sophomore
walk—on Ed Frazier, who was perfect in his first
two games making all three of his field goal
attempts and all eight extra points. The frustration
returned in Pitt’s third game ‘against Syracuse,

_ when Frazier missed two field goals. It continued
in the beginning of Saturday’s game against P
West Virginia when Frazier’s first extra point and .

27-yard field goal attempt were both blocked.
But forget all of that. Pitt fans soon forgave
Frazier’s earlier attempts when he nailed a 42-

S yard field goal with two seconds remaining in

the game to give the Panthers a 31-31, come-
from-behind tie.

“I was just trying to keep my confidence up
and do everything I could in the end to make
that ﬁeld goal,” said Frazier. “This is the biggest

thrill so far this year for me; it’s got to be the most V

exciting thing.”

The comeback started in the fourth quarter
with Pitt behind 31-9. With Pitt down by 22
points that late in the game, nobody even gave
Frazier’s first half misses a second thought. But
before you knew it, Pitt tailback Curvin Richards

scored from six yards out to cut the WVU lead‘

down to 31-28. V . \
With less than three minutes remaining, WVU

down by just three points, the blocked Frazier
kicks were looking huge and were pounding on
the minds of every Pitt fan. But Pitt’s defense

Heidi R. White/T he Pitt News

With bated breath...

Kicker Ed Frazier (1) watches his last-second ﬁeld goal just
push over the goal post in Saturday's 31-31 draw against the
WVU Mountaineers. Frazier, who hit two 42-yard ﬁeld goals in
the game said, "This is the biggest thrill so far this year for me;
it's got to be the most exciting thing." Frazier has hit 6 of 9 this
year, his longest being the 42-yarder. He has also knocked 12

held WVU, and the Panthers got the ball back on V, __

their own 40-yard line with 49‘ seconds left.

“I wanted to get any chance I could to get in
there,” said Frazier. “Everybody just tried to
keep the faith the whole time.”

But Frazier’s chances weren't looking good. It
was fourth and eight with less than 20 seconds
on the clock, and Pitt was 58 yards away from
the end zone. The entire fourth quarter went
Pitt’s way, and the last few seconds were no

exception... Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt hit ‘_ ,

Henry Tuten for a 25-yard gain, putting the ball
on the West Virginia 33. Tuten couldn’t get out
of bounds, and the clock kept going, forcing Van
Pelt to throw the ball away to save the last few
seconds. Just nine ticks remained, and Pitt’s long
field goal specialist, Jeff Van Horne, started to

come out on the field. It would have been a 50- _

yard attempt. ,

As the play clock ticked down to seconds, Van
Horne ran back off as Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried decided to go with one more offensive
play. Van Pelt completed a pass to tight end Tom
Huebner, who ran the ball out of bounds at the
25-yard line, stopping the clock with two seconds.

“If we [hadn’t gone] with that last play, Jeff Van
Horne would have kicked it,” said Gottfried. “I
thought about two years ago when he was here
[in Morgantown] and kicked the winning field
goal [in a 6-3 Pitt victory]. I even thought about
it the night before the game that if it got to a
situation like this I might send Van Home in. But
we decided to go with that last play which got
it in.Frazier’s range. The 25-yard line is his range.

Earlier in the game, we had a fourth down on the i V‘

30 and went for the first down. The 25 is when
we say we’re going to kick, and we go into the
game with that idea.”

“I wouldn't want to try one more than 45
yards,” added Frazier. “I would [think] 50-52 is
the maximum, but I wouldn’t want to try one

Panther Volleyballers trounce Robert Morris

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

Last T hursday’s volleyball
match at the Field House was
much like a drag race. between a
Porsche and a Chevette.’

No contest. E

The 25th ranked Lady Panthers
easily handled the Colonials of

Robert Morris three games to .

none.

Pitt opened up the first game
against Robert Morris by running
out to a quick 91 lead. Lori _Silk
serving and Linda,Zols spiking
were the main sources for the

I lead. Janelle Lantagne then pulled

out of her hat a quick set behind
her head whichMicheleAdamson
quickly jammed over the net.
That spelled ‘the end ‘to any
thoughts Robert Morris had of

 

winning this match. The ﬁnal
score of the first game was 15-2.
The second game was not as
easy mainly because of Pitt’s
sloppy play. Pitt gave Robert
Morris their chances with scores
of 3-3 and 13-8, but the Colonials
with’ their lack of talent were
unable to take advantage. The
final was Pitt 15-8. .
Pitt Head Coach Sue Woodstra
said, “It was tough for Robert
Morris because at the beginning
of the year they were not even
sure if they were going to have a
volleyball team. We had a tough
time keeping our ‘concentration
‘up in this match but we were able
to play real clean volleyball in the
first and third games to put them
away,” Woodstra said.
The third game was Pitt’s best
of the night. They again took

Robert Morris 15-2.

The team committed no
unforced errors, and this led to a
game that lasted all of 12 minutes.
Lantagne dominated this game
with her setting and serving. She
finished the game by serving the
last nine points for the win.

Robert Morris did find one way
to slow Pitt down. With the score
92 in the third game, the match
was stopped when it was
discovered Pitt’s Bridget Gary was
wearing earrings. Illegal. Pitt’s
next point was, of course, scored
by Gary. Justice was served.

Woodstra said, “We mainly
used this game to improve our
passing. We were able to do this
in the first and last game, but we
lost it for a little while in the
second. We still have room to
improve, and we have to if we

have any chance of winning
matches down the road.”

With this win, Pitt improved its
record to 10-4.

Julie Sheils was rested for this
match, but after having such a
good tournament in Nebraska
last weekend she was named the
Big East Female Athlete of the
Week. Sheils had 50 kills in the

tournament and so far this season .

is averaging 4.2 kills per game.

Sue Zonneville is still being
held out of the matches with a
sprained ankle and the team is
not sure of when she will return.

defenders to panic. A Panther
defender touched the ball with
his hand in front of the goal.

The referee awarded a penalty
kick to the Buckeyes as a result of
the handball foul.

Buckeye David Cass took the
kick. His shot was ticketed for the
lower right corner. Kapusta,
however, was able to get to the

kneeled over in disbelief.

“Jay has played very, very well,”
said Luxbacher. “He has really
come into his own.”

Early in the second and final
overtime period, Ohio State drove
again. A pass was made to Scott
Hulme in the left corner. Hulme
beat the defender, sent a pass in
front -of the Panther goal to a

g$wide- open John Campbell. This

time there was not to be a great
save by Kapusta. Campbell easily
sent the ball in the net 10 yar
from the goal. »
The Panthers tied the game
with two minutes left in the final
overtime period. Panther
defender Nick Liberati took a free

the ball in front of the Buckeye

A goal. The ball bounced off players

and came to sophomore forward
Don Overmier who headed the

gjoall over Buckeye keeper Chad

Palmer and into the goal.

“I was playing wide and figured
it would end up going wide,"
said Overmier. “I just jumped up
and headed it to the goal.”

The goal ended a 204.-minute
scoring drought for the Panthers.

A key player for the Panthers,

lo;

9.

Heinz Pak, was injured in the first
half. He sprained his left ankle
landing on the turf after going up
to head a ball. He had to leave the
game but should be able to
practice today.

“A lot of teams would have quit
(after the Buckeye goal), ” he said.

Luxbacher made a key line-up
change in both games in an effort
to create some offense, switching
a midfielder to sweeper back and
moving Pak to center midﬁeld.

Roberto Croce and Nick Lib erati
were each given a chance at
sweeper. Croce started at sweeper
in the Geneva game and Liberati
against Ohio State.

“The idea was to use Heinz
more on the attack,” said
Luxbacher. “Heinz can really
attack.”

However, the ploy was
scrapped about rnid—way through
the first half against Geneva
because Croce looked unfamiliar
with the pos_ition. He was
dangerously carrying balls too
far from his defensive position
and looked unsure in his position
when Geneva was attacking.

‘Croce was put at left stopper
(defender) in the second half.
This is a position which‘ required
strict coverage of a Geneva
attacker. .

“I’m a lot more comfortable
marking someone," said Croce.
“With Heinz behind me I can
concentrate more on the field
ahead of me and let Heinz do the
sweeping.”

Liberati looked and felt a bit
more comfortable playing the
position against Ohio State._

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, October 2, 1989

Sbez'ls’plozy merits serio-

Byscott Campbell
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's
volleyball team defines
a “six-pack” as a hard
spike that ‘hits an
opponent anywhere above
the neck. If that's the
case, then Julie Sheils
delivers them -by the
case. .

Sheils, a senior from
Genoa, N.Y., admits that
she does not deliberately
aim at anybody, but when
it does happen it pumps
the team up. "

“The whole team grins,
and I feel bad that I hit
the person in the face,

but it’s just a thing. If

they’re standing there,
they better move,” said
Sheils.

That
attitude has made Sheils
the Lady Panthers’ most
physically dominating
player. When she isn't
busy knocking off
opponents with her
cannon-like smashes,
she racks up the kills,
compiling a season-high

aggressive‘

against highly ranked
‘ Sheils has been named
to three consecutive, All-
Tournament teams and
was named the Big East
Female Athlete of the
Week last week
following
Tournament where she
outplayed several other
All—Americans.

Head Coach Sue
Woodstra said that
Sheilsiis “definitely” an
All-American candidate
this year, but Sheils
believes that she needs
to play more
consistently. «

“Some days I do [feel
like
candidate], and some
days I don't. ‘Against a
certain team, if I do
really bad, I’m like ‘Julie,
an All—American player
wouldn't do that.’ “

Sheils also says that
she prefers to play
against other top players.

“They make me play
better; they push me, and
I love showing them up. I
think, ‘They're supposed
to bean all-star player?’

the Firstier ‘

Sheils hits the ball as
hard as anyone in the
country, according to
Woodstra.

“She hits with such
power; she's a strong kid.
We don't have much
power; we have to play
smart so when she hits
it hard, it stands out,”
said Woodstra.

Sheils said the worst
part of volleyball is
losing, especially to Penn
State. Sheils and the rest
of the Lady Panthers will
get a chance to tame the
Nittany Lions on October
21 at Fitzgerald Field
House, a ‘match that
Sheils is already looking
forward to. .

“We’ve beaten a lot of
Top 20 teams already,
and we're assuming Penn

State has heard about it,

so we think” that they're
going to be a little
nervous about us because
we've beaten all of those
teams.”

Sheils began playing
volleyball in high school
for South Cayuga Central
High School, a small rural

Presented by the Student Publications Board
A University of Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference event

town near Syracuse, and
was recruited by several
Division I schools
including Pitt, Western
Michigan, Penn State and
Rhode Island. Sheils did
not want to be part of the
big university scene
however and enrolled at
Onondaga Community
College (O.C.C.) in New
York to continue playing.

As a freshman,
Onondaga went to the
Eastern , Regionals for
junior colleges before
losin.g to Genesee
Community College. The
next ‘year, however,
Onondaga beat Genesee
and advanced to the next

round of the National,

Championships before
losing to San Jacinto
Junior,College of Texas,

‘who eventually won the
‘title.

Onondaga finished 10th
in the nation, and seven
members of the team
went on to play at
Division I schools.

“We could have done
better, but we were so
nervous because it‘was
the first time that O.C.C.
had done something like
that,” Sheils said.

Sneiis wished to
continue her career, so
she contacted several
colleges that had
recruited her out of high
school. .

She narrowed her
choices down to Pitt and
Penn State and picked the
Lady Panthers, due in
large part to then head

coach Shelton Collier~.ir“
“He was a really good
coach, and my dream has
always been to be in the
Olympics or on the
National team, and I knew

that he [Collier] was in‘

with them, and he could
help me, and he knew
what I needed to know.”

Collier has since moved
on to a full-time position

with the U.S. National. 4

Team, and Sheils still
plans on playing’
volleyball after her Pitt
ca-reer ends.

“I want to become the
best player that I can be
here’ and have Sue
Woodstra teach me

everything she can that’<C.l’"

make me the best.
[Woodstra] even gets out
there, and she can show
us what she wants to do.
She ‘really explains

things. She, really knows ‘

what she's talking about
with volleyball,” Sheils
said. , ,

“We’re a good team;
we're a very talented
team, a skillful team. We
just have to make sure
we put it all together.
Perfect practice makes
perfect play.”

Sheils isn't sure where
her physical strength, an
important traitiin front
line volleyball, comes
from.

“I don't know; I just an
up in the air and hit it;
maybe it comes from
throwing hay bales
around at home all my
life.” ' .

Maio

’ Continuedfrom page 13
Tournament in Los Angeles. The
word Niesi means “second-
generation Japanese,” and the
tournament _, and ‘ surrounding
festival is the oldest of its kind in
the United States. ‘

Maio competed in regional
matches at CMU, and then
traveled to New York City in
March. He fought his way to an
East Coast Championship and a
place on the team that went to
Little Tokyo in Los Angeles to
battle for the national title.

In a four-match, single

_ elimination format, Maio won all

his fights to earn the right to call
himself “the best of the best."

, Unfortunately, the team didn’t

fare as well and placed second to
the west— coast team.’
Maio started his karate career

Frazier

at Pitt when he joined the Karate

Club as a freshman in 1973. He 8

graduated with a health 1-and
physical education degree in 1983
and is currently a karate instructor _
and physical education teacher,
but his talents do not end there.

When Maio _is not involved ,

with karate, one could probably
catch him in Schenley Park
working on his golf toss...no, not
with his clubs but with frisbees.
Maio is also a professional frisbee
golfer. His interest in frisbee golf
stemmed from his membership
to the Ultimate Frisbee Club while
a student here at Pitt. There is
money in professional frisbee ﬁblf,
but Maio admits that he does it
mainly for fun. ’ "
The City of Champions collects
yet another honor at the hands
(and feet) of Matthew Maio.

Continued from page 12
from there." I ‘

With a Mountaineer Field
record 68,938 people screaming
against him, Frazier lined up for
a 42-yard attempt, his most
important kick of his young Pitt
career.

“Honestly, I couldn’t hear one
thing. On my first extra point and
ﬁeld goal, not that I let it get to
me, I could hear it. Toward the
end of the game I couldn’t hear a
thing," said Frazier. “My main

problem is keeping my head
down. I kept it down on this kick.
When the ball was in the am I
was just praying it would make it
all the way.”

The kick went up. It was
obvious it was straight as the ﬁnal
two seconds expired. The
question was if it would be long
enough. As the 69,00Q in
attendance and national ESPN

audience held their breath and}

rose to their feet, the ball went
just far enough.

Q. Continued from page 11

recovered. On ﬁrst and goal from
the nine, Van Pelt hit T uten in the
left corner of the end zone for a
touchdown. Pitt failed on its
second two-point conversion
attempt of the game.

Pitt went for the onside kick

_ “recovery on the ensuing kickoff.
The ball traveled the required 10

yards, took a bounce off the
chest of Preston Waters, and Pitt
recovered on its own 44 with
4:40 remaining and WVU leading
31-21.

Van Pelt completed three of
five passes during the next drive,

‘W *5 including a 23-yard pass to Olanda

T ruitt and a 21-yard strike to
fullback Ronald Redmon. The
drive failed at the West Virginia
12, and Frazier came on to attempt
a 29-yard field goal. The kick was
good, but WVU was penalized
for roughing the kicker and Pitt
was awarded an automatic first
down and half the distance to the
goal line. Sophomore tailback
Curvin Richards broke through

.- 7:-for a 6—yard touchdown run, and

Frazier converted the extra point
for a 31-28 WVU lead with 2:55
remaining.

West Virginia could not move
the ball past its own 17 thanks to

, _two ineligible receiver penalties

and was forced to punt. Alonzo
Hampton, with 10 yards open in
front of him, called for a fair catch
with :49 left on the clock

After a 2—yard Redmon gain
and two incomplete passes by
Van Pelt, Tuten got free for a 25-
yard gain across the middle on

‘fourth and eight. Van Pelt stopped ~

the clock with an intentional
incompletion, hit tight end Tom
Huebner with an 8-yard strike to
the left sideline, and with :02
remaining, Frazier came on to
boot the tying field goal.

“It feels good to make a
comeback after being’ down by
so much,” said, Panther head
coach Mike ‘Gottfried, whose four-
year ‘record against the
Mountaineers is 2-1-1. “We let

Yliings slide a little bit this week in

practice, and I felt that we weren’t
really ready for the game.”

GotIfried’s biggest conce m was
corralling Harris, the
unpredictable West Virginia
quarterback. The Pitt defense
stymied Harris for most of the
first half, allowing him only 17
J.,,yards rushing and five
1 completions out of 14 attempts.

Those ﬁve completions were
all the Heisman Trophy candidate
needed, however. He threw
touchdown passes of 59, 62 and
four yards to James Jett, Reggie
Riambert and Rembert again.
Harris had 201 yards passing at
the half, a 40.2-yard average.

“If you take away the big plays,

‘we shut him down,” said Pitt

cornerback Alonzo Hampton,
who had two tackles. “He made
three big plays in the first half to
give them the 21 points. In the
second half we did a pretty good
job of not allowing him the to get
the big plays, and it made the
difference in the game. We turned
it around.”

Harris was seven of nine for 49
yards and one touchdown in the
second half. The four touchdown
passes were a career high for
Harris.

“They took it to us in the second
half,” said Harris. “They wanted it
more. We set out a goal to go
undefeated. This is like a blemish
on our record.”

“This is sad,” said WVU head
coach Don Nehlen. “Our players
are not jumpingup and down the
rafters, singing. What more can
you say? It was just unbelievable. ”

PANTHER NOTES: Frazier
missed two field goals last week
in a 30-23 victory over Syracuse,
but was not concerned with his
lapse. He said he had lifted his
head early on those two attempts
and knew he could correct himself
against WVU  Richards rushed
for 130 yards, 100 of those coming
before halftime  WVU’s Waters
had nine tackles, two
interceptions and one fumble
recoverv  Pitt defensive end
Carnel Smith intercepted a Harris
pass and returned it 38 yards to
the WVU 13-yard line at 6:50 of

the first quarter. The Panthers .

failed to capitalize when Frazier’s
27-yard ﬁeld goal attempt was
deflected by WVU linebacker
Renaldo T urnbull. Frazier’s first
PAT attempt, following an*8-yard
Richards’ touchdown run at 12:00
of the first quarter, was blocked
by Lonnie Brockman. All told,
the Panthers failed to convert
two two-point conversions, a PAT
and a field goal, which would
have made a difference of eight
points  Penalties continued to
get the best of the Panthers. Pitt
committed eight infractions at the
cost of 76 yards. WVU had four
for 34 lost yards  Pitt controlled
the ball for 32:49, WVU for 27:11
 Pitt ran 93 offensive plays to
West Virginia’s 60  Van Pelt had
attempted only 67 passes before
the game, completing 51 of them
for 663 yards. His season statistics
are now 77 of 117 for five
touchdowns, five interceptions,
1,029 yards and a 65.8 percent
completion ratio  The tie posts
the Panthers all-time record
against the Mountaineers at 54-
25-3  The Panthers travel to
Temple next Saturday to take on
the Owls, who lost to No. 15
Houston 65-7 on Saturday. Game
time is set for 12:10 at Veterans

. Stadium.

Heidi R. White/1' he Pitt News

Pitt's receiver Reggie Williams (2) couldn't get a hold of this Alex Van Pelt pass, but he was
able to grab two catches in the game for 30 yards; Williams now has 85 receptions in his ,
career, putting him at number 11 on the all-time Panther list, behind Chuck Scales with 87.
