Nixon: Man Of F ew Seasons

by JOHN NIRENBERG
Staff Political Writer

Richard Milhous Nixon is as
close as he has ever been to the
Presidency. His optimism could-
n’t have been more evident than
it was ‘last Monday night when he
gave his standard speech to some
12,000 supporters and 100 heck-
lers at the Civic Arena.

“This is trick or treat week,”
he told his listeners. “A lot of
tricks will be pulled out of the

SG passed three important bills
Wednesday. One bill, “A Resolu-
tion Pertaining to the Behavior
of ROTC Department Members,”
stated that “Whereas a particular
ROTC department member took
physical action with a lethal
weapon” . . . and “whereas, this
action, however provoked by the
student, approaches assault and
battery . . . the SG Senate de-
mands a written report on the ac-
tion taken by the ROTC depar-
ment and requests that a formal
public. apology be forthcoming
from the offending ROTC depart-
ment member.”

A second bill, “A- Bill Concern-
ing Confiscation of Meal Tickets
by Saga Food.” was unanimous-
ly passed by the Senate. The "bill
stated that “the action of the Saga
Food ticket checkers on Friday
was unwarranted” and resolved
that “Sage Food formally apolo-
gize to the students whose meal
tickets were unjustly confiscated
and that Saga Food reimburse
those students whose meal tickets
were unjustly confiscated, for the
price of all meals missed as a re-
sult of the confiscation.”

“A Bill Concerning Fair Prac-
tices in the Sale of University
Weekend Tickets” was also pass-
ed. This bill resolves that “Tick-
ets for Homecoming. Winter
Weekend. and similar events spon-
sored by SG will be sold only on
an individual first-come-first-
-serve basis." In the past. it has
been the practice to sell blocks of
tickets to campus organizations.

bag by the panicky ones on the
other side but the treat’s going to
be for the American people when
on Nov. 5 we tell that gang to get
packing because new leadership
is going to come to Washington,
D. C. —

“We’re taking nothing for grant-
ed and we’re going to ‘sock it to
‘em’ from now throughout the bal-
ance of the campaign to make
sure those listening would under-
stand that it isn’t over until the

 
  
      

available for these events be dis-
tributed as fairly as possible
among the members of the Uni-
versity community without favor-
itism for any single interest
group.”

President Ken Scheuler an-
nounced several appointments.
Among these were Stu Roth, co-
ordinator of the General Assem-
bly; Suzann Slyman, chairman of
the Cooperative Housing Com-
mittee; Victor Willem, student li-
aison to the Office of Program
Development and Public Affairs;
and David Guydan, SG represen-
tative to the University Com-
mencement Committee. Appoint-
ed to the Faculty Senate Com-
mittees were Ellen Dreckam, Ad-
missions Committee; Linda Ca-
han and Liz Zicherman, Library
Committee; and Joanne Telerico
and Ken Schueler, Student Affairs
Committee.

Schueler announced that the
first SG “Bitch-in” will be held
next month. “This will provide
an opportu_nity for vocalizing some
of the problems students have.” he
explained. “I think that the name
is very appropriate.”

Schueler also commented on the
outstanding work done by the
newly formed Legal Awareness
Committee. “The LAC has been
working very well.“ he stated.
“Already they have made con-
tact with the American Civil Lib-
erties Union and have begun eval-
uation of the Student Handbook
and are studying the students’
rights in the University and with
civil laws.”

It was also announced that the
next meeting. Nov. 6. will be an
-informal meeting. which is open

   

   

   

 
      
     
     
    
 
     
       
     
       
       
   
     
     
   
     
       
     
     
   
    
 
   
   
     
         
    

  

votes are counted. Some wish it
were.” he said.

Nixon h a s given th a t same
speech with all the condescending
“Sock it to ‘em’s” to every rally
from New York to San Diego. Nix-
on has been very careful to avoid
the war and in fact he has been
very careful in avoiding all the
issues. He knocks Hubert Hum-
phrey for not only agreeing with
the present administration but for

talking more in office in his four

years than any of his predecessors
in eight. — -

One heckler holding on to a
protest sign said, “I don’t see
what’s wrong with Humphrey,‘ if
he could say and do more in his
four years than what Nixon did in
his eight. then that’s something to
cheer about.”

As usual Nixon didn’t appeal to
reason, or the issues or intelli-
gence; not because he lacks-the
ability to do so but because he
understands the basic character-
istic of American politics — emo-
tionalism. His isn’t the same
brand that Wallace has been dis-
tributing as a neophytebut, blunt
door to door salesman; his is the
refined and sophisticated type.
subtle enough to appeal to 43 per
cent of the Gallup poll.

“Here is the choice,” Nixon said,
“You have the record of one man
with which we have had no peace
for four years and I am proud to

i have served in an administration
 in which we ended one war and
5 kept the nation out of other wars
"for eight years. I say to you we

will restore strength to America,
and the American flag will not
be a doormat for anybody at home
or abroad.”

Another in his repertoire of
cliches is that “When America

Nixon Campaign:

Sock It To VVho?

Richard Nixon’s campaign band-
wagon rolled into Pittsburgh last
Monday for a 7 p.m. rally at the
Civic Arena. As expected it was
representative of Nixon’s effici-
ently organized elaborate cam-
paign and was complete with bal-_
loons, ticker tape, beautiful girls.
and musicians. one of whom was
Roger Williams of Born Free
fame.

The moderator for the rally was
Bob McCully. a writer for Row-
an Martin’s Laugh In, who after
a fewpuns on Vice-President
Humphrey introduced some of the
prominent Republicans in the
state of Pennsylvania. Among
these were Governor Raymond
Shafer and U. S. Sentor Hugh
Scott, who after welcoming Mr.
Nixon. made bids for the people’s
support of Allegheny County’s Re-
publican candidates for office in
both the State and National elec-
tions. *

As Nixon made his appearance,
he was greeted by loud cheers
from a capacity crowd of nearly
13,000 people and a shower of
multi - colored balloons, w h i c h
were dropped from a crate attach-
ed to the top of the‘ Civic Arena
dome. Ascending to the speaker’s
platform with his wife and two
daughters, Nixon waved to the
-crowd and then shouted into the
microphone, “We're going to
win.”

After the cheers died down Nix-
on was greeted again, but this
time by a chorus of booes from a
group of about 60 demonstrators,
many of whom were waving the
red and black flag signifying the
California grape boycott. Ignor-
ing the demonstrators. Nixon start-
ed his speech by stating that
America can't‘ afford four more
years of the same administration:
“This Halloween the other side
is offering you nothing more than

a trick, but we have a treat for the

American people: new leader-
ship.” Then Nixon said that the
American people were on the
march and a sense of victory was
in the air. “But we are taking
nothing for granted,” he added.
“We’re going to sock it to ‘em.”

As the demonstrators began to
boo him again, Nixon shouted,
“There’s one way that you can
tell the difference between a Nix-
on rally and a Humphrey rally.
At the Nixon rally you can hear
the cheers over the heckles.” The
crowd responded to this with wild
applause.

Making no further reference to
the deomonstrators. Nixon pro-

is on the roster. If not on the ros-
ter the student is to go to the of-
fice ofthe registrar immediately
with his pink copy of his CER or
hisinvoice. I '

There are now over 200 students
who are not officially "registered
with the University and if proper
action is not taken by Wednesday,
Nov. 6, they will be considered
as not officially enrolled in that

ceeded with his speech that con
centrated on the “choice th;
American voters have in Novem
ber. “Let me tell you what these?‘
past four years have been like,’
he said. “There has been nothin
but war, crime, high taxes, and
rising cost of living. You saw
what happened in Chicago. It’-
time America had new leader
ship.” ' , ’
Sticking to his usual format
Nixon did not deal with any spew
cific aspects of his polici‘es,—_bu_t;‘
instead stressed campaign gener '
alities and promises. He attacked;
most of the policies of the present-
administration, and cited‘.it’s'7'
achievements as negative. But h
never offered any workable solu
tion to the problems of the ,da_y_.f.
He just stated that alternatives“
would be provided and that the
problems would be solved. '

On domestic issues Nixon said _
that he will establish law and ore‘,
der through the office of a new..
Attorney General, and that anew’-““
policy for wage earners, that will-I
create 415,000,000 new jobs. He ’.
also said that he will alleviat 
the taxes that have eaten up wage
increases and “take the workers,
off the treadmill and put them on“-
the road to progress.” But he did
not say how. i  

Nixon also pledged a new con-ft
servation program to take care of’
the problems of air and water pol-5_
lution, and a new program for the "
cities where the unemployed will;
be trained and “where there will...
be no more welfare, but more pay
roll.” ,  
Nixon then said that he will: ,
take care of the 20,000,000 forgot
ten Americans over 65, by in.
creasing social security benefits 9
every time prices go up. Again he 1
did not say how. . *

On foreign policy Nixon statedif
that -America has furnished most -
of the money and most of the lives
in Korea and Vietnam, but that he 
will initiate a new policy. “Let’s
help them fight the war,” he said,
“but let's not fight it for them.” -'

Then on a harsher noted he add-
ed, “When a second-rate nation"
like North Korea can seize a Unit-[V
ed States ship from intemational__.{
waters, then it is time that the "
United States ha s new leader-
ship.”

Nixon concluded in sayingthat 
the vote of Pennsylvania will de- .
cide the election. “Let’s light the *
lights in the White House again,’’' ._
he said, and then shouted, “Let’s j
win in November.”

Editorial

There has been a great many charges leveled against,
this newspaper in recent weeks. These claims have come to
- a head now that the present status of ROTC is in jeopordy.

A leaflet of allegedly unknown origins suggested The
Pitt News was biased in its presentation of the recent con-
-troversy surrounding the status of ROTC. In recent confer-
ences with us. some members of ROTC could not understand
how The Pitt News could print a “biased or o_pin1o_nated” ed-
itorial. In short, the ROTC cadre at this University feels it
is getting a raw deal because this newspaper is not-printing
- the “facts.” -'

 

We are not distrubed at this allegation, for it provides
us with some very convincing parallels. Take the New York
Times. for example. It is beyond question that The New York
Times is the greatest newspaper in the United States. Yet only
yesterday, Maryland Governor Spiro T. Agnew said the
Times was not printing the facts. His reference was tothe
Times’ editorial suggesting that Agnew was not “fit to stand
one step away from the Presidency.” The highly publicized
editorial exposed some of Mr. Agnew’s conflicts of interest
during his terms as a Baltimore County executive and as
Maryland’s Governor. Agnew has called the editorial libel-
ous.

In a statement to The Times, Governor Agnew’s cam-
paign manager, George W. White. Jr., said, “A newspaper is
supposed to fairly and impartially report the news. The
,Times has violated this code of ethics and in its desire to
elect its chosen candidate, Hubert Humphrey, has become

‘an..‘-‘advocate” and lost all sense of decency . . .”

The result of this combined Nixon-Agnew-White pres-
sure was another Times editorial discussing the unfitness of
Mr. Agnew. This greatest of newspapers did not wilt to the
pressures of a group reaking of sour grapes.

Likewise, The Pitt News will never backdown from a
position it knows to be correct. This newspaper is in a very
delicate position; we- are in the middle of a emotional con-
troversy. And in any highly emotional controversy, persons
on both sides of the issue will endlessly cry out against the
“biased newspaper.” We expect this sort of reaction. Because
of this expectation we hold open—upon reque st—column space
on the editorial page. We also have a “How Our Reader’s See
It” space which can be -used by student who wants to air his
gripes, or who opposes the editorial policy of The Pitt News.
We.do not supress unfavorable letters.

The Pitt News is attempting to be fair in this ROTC con-
troversy. But our attempts will be in vain if “nebulous
groups” continue to circulate infantile leaflets. Our attempts

will be wasted if individuals knowingly fail to partially com-

prehend the complex workings of this newspaper by citing
‘the immorality of publishing “biased editorials.” 4

Many students claim we are practicing “irresponsible
journalism.” Many persons, like Governor Agnew, make this
claim when a newspaper prints an article that runs against
their interests. However, when a newspaper publishes a story
complimentary to an individual or group, its reputation all of
a sudden becomes “reasonable and responsible.”

_ Statements claiming distortion and biased news report-
ing are usually cries of desparation. They serve only to dis-
credit the source of their origin. This newspaper cannot be
interested in “facts” per se. We must be concerned with the
“facts” on both sides of the issue. Many students. and some
members of ROTC, fail to realize this important point.

_ Much to the dismay of some students, The Pitt News
will contine to print “biased and opinionated” editorials, and
we hope to influence the student body on issues of relevant
campus concern. This is part of our function—.-a function that
does not represnt the viewpoint of an outside established
p_ressui_‘e_group. Our viewpoint is representative of the collec-
tive opinion of our editorial board—a body that meets to map

newspaper policy.

A,‘ newspaper should strive to be a forum for the free ex-
pression of conflicting ideas. This goal can be achieved only
if- students at this University cooperate with us by keeping us
informed.-

. Nonewspaper can be perfect; no newspaper can’ be truly
"objective. But with your help. we can hopefully move to-
wards these ideal goals. A ,

Reflections Of The Spleen-

The Three ‘Campaigning’ Bears,
Or, . . . How To Eat An Election

by MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist

Once upon a time t h c - 0 were three bears.
Dicky—Bear. Hubert-Bear. and Georgy—Bear. who
lived in the same forest together. One day while
they were out in the forest gathering votes. Dicky.
Bear turned to the others and said. "Gee. I‘m tired.
Iwish we could find a place to rest for a while.

“Me. too." said Georgy—Bear. “We‘ve been out
here for over three months now."

“HEY, FELLOWS,” cried Hubert-Bear. “I
know just the place to rest. Let’s go over to the big
white house at the end of the forest.”

The other two agreed at once. and so off they
set in search of the big white house. After a while
they came to a clearing and there it was. “Gee I

. didn’t think it was so big. I havent been in it for

eight years.” sighed Dicky-Bear.

Georgy—Bear was also somewhat awed by the
house and afraid to go in. “I don't know if the mas-
ter of the house will enjoy my company. I’m us-
ually not too nice to him.”

“Oh. don’t worry Georgy. he's a personal friend
of mine." said Hubert-Bear. “Why. sometimes he
even lets me think for myself.”

REASSURED, the three bears went into the
house. but found that no one was in. On the table
there was a big bowl marked. “Lyndon-Locks’

‘ Opinion  Fact

ROTC: Controversial Comment,

Stew." and there was a lot of steam coming out of
it. Each bear grabbdd a handful of the stew and
gobbled it down. and each in turn immediately be-
came sick.

“Ugh.“ Dicky-Bear gasped. “how can Lyndon-
Locks live on that?” V

"Yech." groaned Georgy—Bear. “it tastes like
some foreign concoction."

“Bleh.” replied Hubert-Bear." I think it’s more
of a domestic dish. “But anyway. now you guys
know why Lyndon-Locks is such a sour-puss. He
has to eat that stuff every day.”

“Hey." said Dicky-Bear. “do you have to eat

that stew if you live here? I’d like to live here. but i

I don’t know. not if I have to eat that junk.”

“And I’d like to live here. too." said Georgy-
Bear. “but I’ll be danged if I’m going to eat that
junk for four years.”

“WELL,” REPLIED Hubert-Bear. “you have
to eat it every day if you want to live here. Lyn-.
don-Locks does it. Maybe by now he likes it.”

Just then the door burst open and in stepped
Lyndon-Locks. He said. “Somebody’s been eating
my stew. And too bad they didn’t eat it all up.” He
picked up the bowl and offered it to the three
bears who were cowered in the corner. “Have
some?” he asked. “Please have some . . . please?”

Special to The Pitt News

Mr. Rosenblum, concerning your article of Oct.
25 in the Pitt News: We’ve read your version of

what happened. Now the student body will read‘

what really happened at Forbes Field last Tuesday.
The Students for Peace were standing in the

entrance to the field area. An ROTC officer asked -

them to move to the stands or to leave the area.
One of the students told the officer that the stu-
dents were there to arrange a debate with the
ROTC department.

"ALSO TAKING place.at the same time was the
incident between Sergeant Bostwick and Mr. Mc-
Kenzie. Sergeant Bostwick informed Mr.‘ McKen-
zie it was illegal to wear official Army buttons on
an officer’s jacket, unless the person was serving
in some way in- the Army. Mr. McKenzie replied.
“If it’s illegal. then cut them off.”

Then Sergeant Bostwick asked. “Cut the rib-
bonsoff?” ’

Mr: McKenzie said. “Yes. cut the buttons off. ”
Sergeant Bostwick then cout off four buttons.

David Rosenblum has stated that he did not ob-
serve the incident until Sergeant Bostwick left.
Nevertheless. Mr. Rosenblum described it as if he
had witnessed the entire thing. It was described as

a “blatant act of assault” in Mr. Rosenblum’s edi-

torial.

Dave Rosenblum’s article is a distortion of the
facts as they happened. The students at this Uni-
versity should know that Mr. Rosenblum is a
spokesman for the Studentsgor Peace.

THIS IN itself would seem to prove his intent
in writing his article on the ROTC issue. In a legal
sense. the ‘statement “Thomas McKenzie was will-
fully assaulted by Sergeant Benedict Bostwick‘?
constitues defamation of character. Mr. Rosen.
blum has taken the place of a District Attorney. a
judge, and a jury.

We have plenty to say about what action. legal
or otherwise, should take place. We consider your
article of Oct. 25 as slanderous. And as Pitt students
we believe that any person who would resort to dis-
tortion of the true facts and the prejudice of pre-
judgment to attempt to _ sway student opinion
against other students, is unfit to sdrve on our
school newspaper staff. We believe. that Mr. Rosen.
blum should be dismissed from the Pitt News staff
for gross misconduct and irresponsibility. =

Official Facts And Apology  

FACTS

A regularly scheduled ROTC leadership lab-
oratory was held at Forbes Field on Tuesday, 22
October, 1968, in the 12-12:50 p.m. time "period.
As the cadets were-entering the field through the
Sennott Street entrance, they were joined by a
group of approximately 42 inidviduals, all students,
except Dr. James Holland and Mr. Chasen. Thomas
McKenzie was a member of this group.

Mr. McKenzie was wearing an olive-green
Army officer’s jacket that he had purchased. He
was wearing the jacket as he had purchased it with
the addition of several peace symbols. He had ques-
tioned the salesman at the time of purchase about
wearing the jacket with the buttons on it. The sales-
man said it was legal to wear it as it was with the
buttons on it.

FOUR MEMBERS including Dr. Holland and

Mr. Cliasen approached Major Henry Gordon, sen-‘

ior officer present, and talked with him about the
possibility of having a debate on the question of
ROTC at the University. Mr. McKenzie was ob-
serving this from a short distance.

M/Sgt. Benedict Bostwick, a member of the
ROTC staff, approached Mr. McKenzie and grab-
bing his jacket. according to Mr. McKenzie, but
according to Bostwick. pointing to the buttons,
told him that it wasillegal to wear the jacket with
the buttons on it. Mr. McKenzie replied to the ef-
fect that if he were breaking the law, he would
remove the buttons. but at the time, he had no
way of removing them.

Thereupon M Sgt. Bostwick and Mr. McKen-
zie accompanied by Col. David Clagett and David
Rosenblum came to Mr. Rose’s office, at his re-
quest. to discuss the incident and find a solution
agreeable to both parties.

After discussion and agreement to the descrip-
tion of the incident as contained above, the ques-
tion of how to settle the matter was then pursued.
Accordingly. M Sgt. Bostwick stated that he had
acted as an individual and did exercise poor judge-
ment; he apologized to Mr. McKenzie. For his part.
Mr. McKenzie stated that he accepted the apology
and although not approving he did understand
M Sgt. Bostwick’s actions.

Col. Clagett emphasized that “the policy of the
Department of Military Science has been and is
that members of the department will not in any
way interfere with students or student activities.
This is the first time such an incident has occurred
and it will not be repeated."

Mr. Rosenblum requested a copy of this state-
ment. Rose agreed after both parties had signed it.

Views, Criticisms

Editor, The Pitt News,

Congratulations. on your edi-
torial of 28 October. It was a per-
fect example of ambiguity and
distor‘ion. .

You accused the ROTC of “hap-

hazardily using statistics to beef
up its case.” You further stated
red to was unreliable becausd
of a lack of student participation.
True. only 25 per cent of the
students voted. but 72 per cent
of those chose the contimuation
of ROTC as is. Furthermore.
1.686 students suppol ted ROTC.

You wrote that there were 6.-
500 enrolled students-at the time,
and therefore the referendum
wasn’t representative of the stu-
dent body. I wish to inform you of

‘the fact that in the SG election

in which Ken Schueler was elect-
ed. he received only 1,049 votes.
One-and-one-half times as many
students support ROTC as sup-
port the SG President. There-
fore, by your reasoning, Ken
Schueler is not a legal Presi-
dent of the student body. and it

follows that any actions taken by I

himare not legal.

Therefore all Cabinets ap-
pointed by him are illegal; the
two students on the Under-
graduate Council are illegal; and
most important of all. the decision
of that Council to re-valuate
ROTC is illegal. This is exactly
the position of the ROTC bri-
grades; (i.e. ). the Council did not
properly represent the students.
and ‘therefore their decision is
not valid.

You further accused ROTC of
having “skirted the truth. used
distorted statistics. and practiced
the George Wallace tactics of per-
suastion." Aren’t you guilty of the
very same offenses yourself?
You not only skirted the truth.
you skirted the whole issue! You
write your editorial on a little
side issue. rather than the main is-
sue, namely the decision of the
Council and the credit status of
ROTC.

It is your duty to speak clearly
on all issues. and tosee that you
make no ambiguous statements.
From your attitude. I can only
gather that you didn’t want to
commit yourself and possibly step
on someone’s toes. If this is the
case. you. your staff. and the en-

Editor. The Pitt News,

I would like to open by stating
that I am not a member of the
ROTC brigade but I do have strong

‘feelings concerning the move to

abolish credit for ROTC courses.

I have heard several arguments
against the ROTC program all of

which impress me as being ir-

rational and impractical.

They are usually made by in-
dividuals who are blinded by their
own prejudices against the pro-
gram.

The dictionary defines an aca-
demic education as one which is.
“formal and theoretical. not pra-
tical.” The education (course) a
cadet receives in the ROTC pro-
gram is highly theoretical and
formal. Cadets study‘ courses
which range from Military

History to Military Tactics, all of I‘

which are as formal and theore-
tical as those offered by any
other University department.

Of course. practical education is
also necessary in ROTC and takes
the form of leadership lab; but
isn’t it true that in physics and
chemistry courses practical educa-
tion is also required in the form
of lab periods? Even the fine art
of sculpting requires practical
experience.

I’m sure very few of those op-
posed to’ROTC would argue that
physics. or chemistry. or sculp-
ture are not academic disciplines
so why do they attack ROTC on
these grounds?

I also must oppose the argu-
ment put forth by Mr. Yetto in
his article concerning the aboli-
tion of ROTC credit. Mr. Yetto
states that. “ROTC is basically
set up for the student’s benefit
in the future. This itself is the
main reason a person takes RO-
TC and whether or not he receives
credit for it should not be import-
ant.” This is an asinine statement
to make. Every student in this un-
iversity is here because he wants
to better his future.

Every course taken is taken so
that one can become better educa-
ted and thus earn a higher salary
or command more respect in his
future life. A student takes ac-
counting so that 5 years from now

Editor. The Pitt New s,

Congratulations! I have just re-
ceived my 1968 OWL yearbook.
and have examined scupulousy
the work of the greatest minds of
Pitt. I expected to find it the usual
dreary list of credits for the ego-
centrical aspiring young jock.

Instead. I was pleasantly surpris-
ed by the bold frank attitude taken
towards the important issues that
occured ‘in our society and our
campus for the last four years. The
lay—out was imaginative and the
color inserts were superb. This
.publication left me with an image
of Pittsburgh and my four years
of undergraduate college life that
I could not even begin to formulate
on__my own — it._captured some-
thing real and this is an unusual
accomplishment indeed.

I have compared it with a“num-
ber of other yearbooks that follow
graduate students here at Boston,
University brought with them from
their respective undergraduate in-
stitutions. This book is tops. it has
the others beat! Once again con-
gratulations.

However. everything has its
faults and this yearbook I am af-
raid shares its faults along with
the rest. lam refering to the sen-
ior class photos and in particular
the photos of the girls. As I gazed
through the morass of Senior pic-
tures I couldn't help but notice an
unbelievable number of exquisite.
gorgeous. delectably licentious
alluring females.

I thought fora moment that I
was looking at the wrong year-
book. What happened to the slop-
py acne-complexioned slobs that

I used to see floating around Oak— -

land for four years? Did they all
disappear did the OWL find the
fountain of beauty and somehow

’manage to inject these into the

girls’ pictures?

Where were all of the “pigs“
the guys in the Towers used to
complain about and bring to the
house dances? Come now — for
a yearbook that so truthful when
it comes to the important events
and issues that plagued our cam-
pus for the past four years how
could you possibly pass up the
fact that Pitt girls by nature are
for the most part UGLY?

Yours Truly.

would be destitute today. ‘

But I digress. We were discussing the changes in c_o,_lI-.-
lege life during the last ﬁfteen years. Let’s take up-onew
change in particular: the emergence of a new breed of‘

admissions dean. _ 
The_old breed of admissions dean (and they are stil

a major_ity) admit freshmen on" the basis of standard;

cut-and-dried criteria: IQ.score, SAT score, high school

standing. But the new breed of admissions dean occa#'
sionally will take a chance on an applicant with a low,

IQ, a low SAT score, low high school standing. He looks
not so much at a man’s test scores as at the man. If the

dean's intuition tells him that within the man are hidden ,
qualities, something rare and special that would enrich —.
the college, the man gets in, test scores notwithstand1.ng.‘f

Take, for example, the ease of Champert Sigafoos.
Champert’s credentials for college were not what you‘

would call promising. He graduated _419th in a high ‘I
school class of 419. His IQ was 14; I118 SAT score was»

12. Also he was bald on one side.

Nevertheless Champert trudged from campus to cam-
pus, showing his dossier to admissions deans. Everywhere
the result was the same: projectile vomiting.

Then one day Champert came to a campus where the

admissions dean, E. Pluribus Ewbank, was one of the.

new breed. “Champert,” said Dean Ewbank, “my intui-

tion tells me that within you are hidden qualities, some»

thing rare and special that would enrich the college.”

  

“You’re out of your bird,” said Champert. - -

“N o, Champert,” said.Dean Ewbank, “I know whereof '

I speak, for I am not only the dean of admissions here?
but I am also the basketball coach. And the hidden quali-

ties I see within you are that you are seven feet three. ..

inches tall.”

So Champert was admitted. It did not, alas, work out 
as well as it might have, for Champert shortly developed 
acromegaly, (a morbid fear of hoops) and was dropjiéd. '

Today,_a broken man, he earns a meagre living asai
mooring mast in Akron. 
Dean’Ewbank is no longer with the college either; he

has gone intothe three-minute auto washtgame.

 Opinion Vs. Fact

 

WE CONSIDER Mr. Rosenblum unfit to serve
.on this newspaper, because he has misused the free-
dom of the press, and in so doing, he has attacked
a cornerstone of democracy. We as students do,not
‘want our school paper to be used as a continual lit-
erary mouthpiece for the personal political aims
of a particular individual or group; especially
when this individual or group resorts to slender
{and lies to-further their political ends.

We now look to you, the student body, to pre-
sent what we believe is the real issue concerning
’ this incident. This issue is not whether ROTC will
-_ remain on campus or whether credit will be given
,..to our course, because you, the student body last
E January overwhelmingly voted for keeping ROTC .

for credit.

, But the real issue is whether we, the student
body are going to permit 40 students to set them-
,,selves up as Almighty God, and dictate to us what
is morally right or wrong, what courses we may or
'may,not take, and what we can or cannot do. Do
we want another Berkeley or another Colubmia?

he can become a CPA. Shouldn’t
he receive credit for this course
even though he is taking it only
for the future benefits he will
gain from it?

Mr. Yetto would say no, or at
‘least his statement indicates such
‘an answer. The whole idea of a
V college education is that the stu-
< dent can better himself both intel-
lectually and culturally so that he
ymay live a happier more produc-
- tive "life both now and in the fu-
ture.

I respect the right of those who
oppose ROTC to voice their opin-
ion. However, the fact remains that
in the-complex world we live in,
- filled ‘with hate and suspicion.
a military force is vital for a na-
, tion’s survival.

Perhaps one day this situation
will change, but until it does the

students (approximate) who voted
in that election did not constitute
a reasonably random and repres-
entative sample of the 6.500 pop-
ulation of which they were a
part. For all the facts he presents
(or fails to present l. we might just

as easily believe that if a substan-

tial majority had voted. there
would have been an even greater
percentage of students in favor
of continuing ROTC with credit.

If we may believe the editor
when he says “the Pitt News re-
spects any groups . . . that is wil-

ing to present its case or problem
n a rational and intelligent man-
er,” it is unfortunate that he
must have such a low opinion of
imself. But this is readily un-

iderstandable since the explicitly

manifests his insecurity and faint-
heartedness. for example. when he
states that the leaflet “plays upon
the fears” of those who read it.

If the editor really feels that the
innocuous leaflet in question
plays upon his fears. let's hope
that he finds respite and nepen—
the from his security blanket
or teddy bear. Moreover. the in-

ferential process whereby he comes

to link “George Wallace tactics
of persuasion with the contents
of .the ROTC leaflet certainly
must be one that “surpasses human
understanding” —— it certainly sur-
passes deductive logic.

In sum. the editor convinces us
to believe the following modi-
fied version of a sentence from
his closing remarks: No student
should fall prey to this highly un-
ethical and irrational presenta-
tion. for (my editorial) represents
the summit of ignorance.” How
sad;

Tcll

ELEGTON RET”

The University Students for
Conservative Action (SCA) an-
nounces its support of Richard
Nixon for the President of the
United States.

“The no—win war in Vietnam.
the humiliation of the United
States by North Korea. the riots
in our cities. the rising crime rate.
runaway inflation and a credibil-
ity gap so wide it has become a
chasm are only a few of the rea-
sons why this country is despar-
ately in need of a change that Mr.
Humphrey cannot possibly pro-
vide.” an SCA spokesman com-
mented. '

“We feel that Mr. Nixon is the
man to bring about this change.
His ability, experience, integrity
and patriotism make him the most
qualified candidate for President.

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Feature Editor

In and around Pittsburgh this
month are quite a few interesting
scenes which will offer many op-
portunities for you to put on your
rags and show the world that all
is not lost. For a start everyone
should put in an appearance at the
Walt Harper Jazz Workshop.
Featured there this month will
be Hugh Masekela (Nov. 3, 6-10
p.m.) and Erroll Garner (Nov. 30,
8-12 p.m.) Both performances
should be packed (these guys are
great) so make reservations early
by calling 471-7725.

Another gig soon to sweep down
on the Pittsburgh audience is
Peter, Paul & Mary, who I’m sure
need no introduction. They will
be in concert at the Syria Mosque
on Nov. 16 & 17. More information
on this can be picked up at the
SU desk. PP&M is one group
that you don't want to miss. They

are so much better live than on re- .

cord. Of equal importance but -in
another stream is the Pittsburgh
Opera series. I went to see their
first performance of Rigoletto
and came away completely smash-
ed. Such grandeur. Such pageant-
'ry. Such emotion. I was little.
handicapped by the fact that I

environment. Anyway the works
are secondary when it comes to
the singing. So I recommend the
next opera Samson and Dalila
which is going to be held Dec. 5
and 7. Nothing like a little advance
notice. Get information at the SU
desk.

At last, but not in any sense the
least, is the forthcoming Intema-
tional Theater performance by

 

the National Ballet of Canada.
This company, composed of dan-
cers from Canada,
Europe and South Africa, will un-
dertake the prodiguous task of
performing two complete ballets
on the same day — The Nutcraker
and Swan Lake. It is not every
day (in fact it is.not every cen-
tury) that a ballet company pro-
duces two different pieces on the
same day. November 30 has_ been
designated as the debut of this
momentous occasion. Again the
International Theater is offer-

An unusual occurrence will take
place as the International Theater
presents two complete ballets on
the same day, Nov. 30 by the
National Ballet of Canada.

Tickets for the Lettermen
Concert are on sale at the SU
desk. It will be presented on
Saturday, Nov. 9 at 8:30 p.m.
in the Syria Mosque. The pro-
gram will also feature the Wil-
son Brown Trio.

Aspects of Mexican Culture

The harsh primordial horn Fan-
fare that initiated Javier de Leon’s
“Fiesta Mexicana” announced a
return to the time of Indian cli-
vilizations and the performance
of Aztec-Mayan ritual dances.

Typical of these mythical re-
ligious dances were the Mayan
version of the Deer Dance, which
symbolically presented primitive
mating and subjugation conflict,
and a ceremonial dance composed
of the dancers’ impersonation of

Theodoro Marca, La Conte de

This is an incomparable musi-

“Fantistic” from Jose Greco,
who attended their performance.

exciting team to the campus.

ed movements of the performers
in the Deer Dance communica-

primitive struggle for life. These
primitive dances mythically re-
presented conflicts and problems
in the concerns most crucial to
these early Mexicans.

Leon’s “Fiesta” Symbolizes

characterized the colorful, joy-

ful songs and dances from Vera . » 

Cruz. Though comparable to
North American colonial forms,
these dances were distinctly La-
tin in their rhythm and light-

hearted flirtatious manner. Among ..
the dances of modern Mexico 7
was a Chiapas Wedding Dance,“f_»

in which two dancers represent-'
ing game cocks fight for a girl,
and the traditional Dance of the.
Old Men. Although the perfor-
mance centered around the dan-
ces, an orchestral interlude’ fea-
turing mariachis and marimbas as
well as a highly skilled florreador
and a female mariachi singer
varied the program.

The “Fiesta Mexicana” was
fun, colorful and spirited, and the
enthusiasm of the audience was
apparent. The bright, -ematé
costumes and the vibrant rhythm
communicated the joy of the

Mexican fiesta. The spirited »Mex- ,

ican culture pervaded the perfor-
mance. The movement of the
dancers, a tilt of the head, the
angle of the shoulders and back,
the effortless, graceful handling
of scarves, shawles and mantles
expressed an attitude of self-
possession and pride.

The “Fiesta Mexicana” cele-‘
brated a way of life. Responding
to such a performance is like
watching a beautiful black woman,
walking down the street and feel-
ing in that easy, proud, free rhy-
thm of her body, her pride in her-
self and ‘her culture. One can-
not help but be moved by a grow-

ing sense of one’s own dignity _

and the dignity of all peoples.
The “Fiesta Mexicana” celebra-
ted the Mexican people and
their culture and so was an af-
firmation of the value of all

' peoples.

 Are Disgusted: 
  Time for a Change

Sports Editor

.\n u]H'n /(‘Ilrr In NH (II/I/1"(".

We are disgusted. Weiare disgusted with the losing tradi-

 tion of Pitt athletics. We are tired of watching football players 2

who don’t want to play football. We are tired of watching soc-
cer players who can’t play soccer.

Most of all, we are sick of an athletic Department that is

 running on a treadmill of mediocrity. An Athleﬂn.Depart-
 inent too tied to the past and too guided by dollar signs.

_ What we need around here is a dedication to bring--
 ing Pitt up to a first class level so it can compete with other
 teams respectably, or we need a complete de-emphasis of
 sports to a truly small college level. -

To accomplish this former, there would seem to be a

 need for new -and dynamic leadership in- the front office.

Even to adopt the latter, there is a need for a change in the

present status quo policies of the Athletic Department. Will 5

we see some sort of action?
Of coursefthe main area of our discontent is the foot-

 ball program. There have been several missed chances for
-- wins this year, and the immediate reaction is to criticize

the coaching. But coaching does not lose games 63-7 and 50-

 17.

There is a basic need to change the program to more

 closely match those of our opponents or there is a need to
 change the calibre of our opponents. As it is now, nearly every

team we play has us outprogrammed.
Miami, UCLA, and Notre Dame are the obvious examples.

3 Their requirements are lower, they redshirt, they get junior
5 college transfers, they seemingly have unlimited scholar- ~
55 ships. Schools like these have no place on our schedule. Yet, 5
; whom do we pick up nextyear but one of the worst of- =
E fenders of all—Oaklahoma. ' ‘

Is this fair to the players, the coaches, or even to the

 school’simage? _
But the “football factories” aren't the only schools that ;
 can be singled out. The service academies all have a prep 
 schoolsystem that feeds football players into school. In fact. _
 Air Force has a prep school right on campus that currently 
 has approximately 23 football players enrolled.

Beyond the prep school set-up, the service academies

‘ also have aturn-back program, which, if abused, could be

used for full scale red-shirting. In it, any cadet doing poor-
ly academically is foreced to repeat a year in school while
sitting out athletics. Air Force, though, currently has no

The Panther s have been their own biggest enemy this sea— ‘

son with all the mistakes and penalties that they have made. So
fax this season the gridders have committed 50 penalties for
407 yards. Last veal. fol the season. they only were called for

45 penalties.

“The boys are‘ coached well
enough." said head coach Dave
Hart. “They get a little tense
and nervous and then this leads
them to make mistakes. Some-
times. thsy just try too hard.”

The gridders will have to curb
their own mistakes against Miami,
expecially since the Hurricanes
have the type of defense which for-
ces their opponents into hus-
takes. The big man on the Miami
defense is number 89, Ted “Mad
Stor ” Hendricks.

“Hendricks is /the best defen-
sive end that Ighave ever seen,”
exclaimed Hart. “He just man-
handles the guys blocking him.
and he kills you with his pursuit
from behind.”

Last year Hendricks blocked a
George Medich punt and, in the
same motion, caught the ball and

returned it eight yards. This
year Hendricks has 4 fumble re-
coveries (11 in his career) and
every tackle he makes adds to
his own school record...

In the 58-0 defeat last year,
Hart tried to run right at Hend-
ricks and it proved disasterous.

' “I still think that this is the

way to beat Miami." said Hart.
“and John McKay at USC prov-
ed it. Of course. we don't have
an ‘O. J. Simpson to do the run-
ning at Hendricks.”

This year Hart plans to do most
of his work through the air lanes.
According to assistant Coach
Thomas “Red” Gravey’s scout-
ing report. “Miami is extre-
mely tough against the running
game. but they have some trouble
against the pass.”

Hart will have Dave Havern
at the Panther reigns this week.
Haver, who is in the top ten
nationally in passing, has shaken off
ankle, elbow, and knee injuries
suffered in the Air Force. Back-
ing him up this week, will be
Chuck Winters in the number two
slot. Frank Gustine will practice
only slightly at quarterback and
will remain in the defensive
secondary.

For the first time in a long
while, the injury list has shrunk-
en. Out for the Miami game are
offensive tackle George Rich-
ards and middle guard Lloyd Wes-
ton. Denny Ferris has a slight
Charley horse in both thighs, but
should be able to play.

Returning to_ the line—up will
be fullback Tony Esposito, line-
backer Ed Gallin, defensive
back Jeff Barr, and defensive
ends Bob Ellis and Jack Wiley.

Against Air Force, the defense
played probably its best game this
season. “We used a new five
man front and it proved to be a
big improvement,” explained
Hart. “Also, the use of a 4 deep
secondary and the.flip-flopping
of our defensive ends strength-

ened us.” Hart signaled out the

play of end Bill Pilconis and
linebacker Jeff Brown as out-
standing.

Miami is 4-2 on the season, but
they were upset last week by Au-
burn, and as Garvey says,
“Auburn certainly did a good
job of getting Miami ready for

us. The week after they lost to 1

USC, they beat tough LSU, 30-
0-)?

Keeping that in mind, Hart
and his players have a real
tough job ahead of them tonight,
but it can be done.

“tum-backs,” although the possibility alwasy exists.

_ Meanwhile, at Pitt, there is no redshirting even when it
 is to the player’s academic ‘benefit to spend five years in
 school. Provisions for ‘limited redshirting could easily be
 devised.

What’s more, there’s no inspection system built into our
agreement. Who's to say that one of the other schools isn’t
cheating? A Penn State football player that stayed in a fra-

several non-injured red-shirts. Shouldn’t there be some way
to check on this?

These are just some of the problems. Last year an ad

= hoc committee researched these and other problems very ex-

tensively and presented their findings to the Chancellor
and Mr. Carver. The general feeling on their part was one
of acceptance.and agreement with the petition? and most of

 its reccommendations. But since that time not one step to-
5 wards implementation has been taken.

It is a question of not -pushing hard enough

 for_more money, better facilities, and an improved program;
 or lS'lt a question of not wanting to push? Thisis a serious
Q; question that needs to be answered.

Last year_ the excuse was, “Things are getting better.

 Wait until next year. The football team will goat least 5-5.”
5; Well, the football team is destined for its third straight 1-9
 season. The soccer team, though laboring in obscurity, is
‘: getting clobbered.

It is time for some changes, and maybe the changes must
start at the top. There is a lack of respect for the people

 who are running the show-both administrators and coaches.
. Excuses are running things. It is time for fresh ideas and
=‘ fresh faces.

Furthermore, it is time to stop worrying about the E.
C.A.C. and the N.C.A.A. It is time to start worrying about
‘Pitt. Let’s start to. build anew winning tradition. Let’s
start now.‘

turned from last year’s‘ stingy
defensive unit,‘ the Hurricane
defense has improved. In six
games, Hurricane foes have man-
aged just 81 points.

Leading opponent crusher is
6-8. 225 Ted Hendricks. The All-
American defensive end is the
most feared linesman in the col-
lege ranks.

Hendricks is flanked by a
powerful line that averages 6-4,
235. At the other end position,
junior Tony Cline (6-3, 234)
adds -speed and strength to the
Hurricane blitz.

Record-breaking middle guard
Jerry Pierce (6-1. 222). and
tackles Bill Trout (6-4. 240) and

opponents just 1.94 yards per car-

tion in Tony Stawarz and Bob
Abbott. They are responsible for
three of the interceptions Miami
grabbed.

But although the Miami defense
appears too stubborn for a Pan-
ther victory. the gridders should
have less trouble staying in the
game than in last year's 58-0
drubbing.

Hurricane offensive attack is
shaky. to say the least. Miami
has been limited to 91 points
this season. a figure well be-
hind last year's pace.

Field genejal Dave Olivo has
passed for a 53.6 per centage,

but the senior signal-caller has been

dumped for 113 yards on the
ground.

Running , backs Vince Opalsky.
Bobby Best. and John Acuff
have also had their problems pene-
trating enemy lines. Opalsky is
the leading ground gainer with a
mere 206,yards rushing in six
games.

The offensive line has been
hurt by its inexperience. and only
James Schneider started on last
year’s Hurricane squad.

But the Hurricanes. who will be
seeking revenge from last week's
31-6 loss to Auburn. win by hold-
ing the opponents to less points
than they accumulate.
