[which has existed since State took ’

StatelCollege last Friday night. Each
am won three gamesand lost one

 in the regular schedule ofthe section.

The big fuss was originally sched-

to both

ﬁnallywon out, and the scene of battle
was changed to Pittsburgh. The doc-

itrine of neutrality will be preserved,

ntilfthe night of the game. I

The winner of tomorrow night's —
game will be pitted against either Al-

right cleaned up the central section

 .a victory last Friday night,.while

 arthmore clinched the lead ‘in the

week’s trip; that. is, Lubic and Gra-

and Ochsenhirt and Hastings
holding down the‘ guard positions.
Healy, Carlson and McCollough will
be in reserve. This combination is
reckoned the strongest . possible for
Pitt, Lubic being particularly beneﬁt-

A  by the shift from guard to for-

ward. Ben displayed no weakness at

‘the defensive position lastweek, hold- '

ing Blakeslee to one goal and making

“two ringers himself, but the Braddock

boy much prefers the forward’s job.

“The wearing of the Green” by the
freshmen terminated last Monday
night with the ceremonies “held at the
Trees Stadium, when the ﬁrst. year
men cast their "caps into a‘ bonﬁre
which had been lighted jointly. by the
Presidents of the Freshman and Soph-
omore classes; while“ the coeds, -with
their green lanterns, paraded around
the immense ﬁre and buried the hat-
chet. .

Five minutes after the burying of
the said hatchet, it was uncovered by-
.a small denizen of the Soho district

but no trace has been seen of it since.

Monday night was the occasion of
the annals cap-burning exercises and.
was attended by many of the students
~who -braved the sharp wind and saw
the thing through. There was excite-
-ment of all kinds, but no “rough stuff”
except when the Sophomores over-
powered the Freshmen who were giv-
ing out pretzels and relieved them of
the same. i ,

Freshmen who desired to retain
their caps A ere allowed to ‘do so, but
scores of "t e “greens” went into the
ﬁre’. There was a formal declaration
of friendship among the upper and
lower classmen. ’The freshmen still
have a “string” attached to them, for
they‘ will be required to .avoid the
main- entrance to the college buildings,
will not be permitted to smoke on the
campus or about the buildings and are
forbidden to wear prep school insig-
nia. ' v

The bonﬁre was lighted by L.’ G.

Captains’ of Industry,‘ scientists,
scholars,» alumni, students, instructors
and friends of Old Pitt gathered to
do honor to her natal anniversary. and
to witness the formal ceremonies- in
connection with that ‘important ad-
junct,of the Institution, the Mellon In-
stitute, in an all-day celebration, last
-Friday. Under the marshalship of
Dean ‘Fetterman, of the College, the
asemblage marched from State’ hall,
along Grant boulevard toVFifth ave.,
to ‘Memorial hall, where the exercises
wereheld. ' '

Headed by President G. F. Ashe,
the students followed by ,the mem-
bers of the various faculties, in caps
and gowns, were lined up as follows:
College, Education, Economics, En-
gineering, Mines, Graduate school,
Medicine, and Dental‘. Upon reaching
the entrance . to Memorial hall, the
students lined up on each side and un-
covered as the members of _the facul-
ties’ of the various schools and the
honored guests passed the two lines.

The invocation was by Bishop Cort-

mick presided. Dr. Rossiter Worth-
ington Raymond of New York, known
as the dean of American mining en-
gineers, delivered the oration of the
day on “Knowledge and, Research.”
He said in part: -

“Pittsburgh instinctively recognized, even in
our colonial period, as a stratgetic point, to
be defended at all costs, has remained through
the astounding revolutions of its history,
ways the center of power and progress,
demonstrating in their later days that the
wealth accumulated in the service of man
through‘ smoky industries is ‘available for man’s
service also in the fair ﬁelds of science and
art. ' .

“The conception of university education has
undergone, in the lastzcentury, an important
change. Today, we care‘ little for the old
classiﬁcation. Our notion of_ a full university
is that of the motto of Ezra Cornell, who
founded the one which bears his name, as a.
place where anyone could receive instruction
in anything. _

“Research is not fruitful unless it is, or
until it is, scientiﬁc. The essential quality of
science is, that it ‘is quantitative, while mere

tive. And this brings us to the proposition
scientiﬁc knowledge. If knowledge and re-
search are thus intimately related, each re-

are combined‘ in this institution must e
recognized as largely novel and wholly ad-
mirable. For effective research requires suit-
able apparatus, and underlapnaratus we include
books. .Moreover, research is promoted by
deﬁniteness of object. ' I ’

“Alas! While we thus launch in hope
another stately ship of peace, bearing blessing
to 0l1X“.Ch~l1dI'€n and our children’s children,
the nations are building and sailing and sink-
ing battleships. the goat of one of which would
establish a great university. War is squander-

of Pittsburgh upon its retention of the old

activities. As a,membcr of a technical pro-
fession, I place the highest value ' upon ‘the
liberal preparation which, in'my judgment, is
still the best foundation for“ usefulness and‘
successin any speciality of modern training.”

The presentation speech in connec-
tion -with the dedication of the Mellon
Institute was made by Dr. W. J. Hol-
land, director of Carnegie Museum
and formerly chancellor of the Uni-.
versity, on "behalf of Andrew W. Mel-
lon and Richard B. Mellon, the donors.
Dr. Holland said in part:

“In a certain sense, Mr.“ Chancellor, this
building is a —memorial to Robert Kennedy
Duncan. Onone. side of the entrance is a
bronze slab ‘_ inscribed with the name of Thos.
Mellon; on theother side of the entrance is
a bronze slab inscribed with ‘the name of
Robert Kennedy Duncan. But, Mr. Chancellor
this splendid ediﬁce erected upon the campus
of our university is more than an cenotaph. ‘It
not merely commemorates the names and
careers of those of whom I have spoken, but
it is_intended to serve as the seat of advanced
inquiries alongiscientiﬁc lines, which will tend
to the promotion not merely of intellectual
culture, but of industrial success, and that not
merely in this great ‘workshop of the world,’
where it is located, but through the land. In
creating this institution our"dear friends have
been actuated by a high and intelligent pur.
pose. Large‘ experience in‘ great industrial.
enterprises ‘has taught them the importance of

the industrial arts, and they feel, that, wonder-
ful as has been the progress made within the
last centllljyy there .are untold mysteries in
nature, ‘which have not yet been revealed, but
Which. If uncovered. are capable of being. used

trustees, this institution, which is capable. of

advancement of human welfare.”

An informal luncheon was held at
the University Club at 1 o’_clock in
honor of the guests and friends of
the «Un1versity_.attending the dedica-
tion of the Mellon Institute. Among
those present were the trustees of the
University, visitors representing other
institutions, the faculty, and degree
men of the University.

Jludge Elbert Henry Gary, who suf-
fered from a mild attack of grippe
when attending the -banquet at the
Charter Day feast of the University
is reported well by members of his
family. Sitting at the banquet table,
Judge Gary found himself too hoarse
to deliver the speech which he had
prepared for the function, and retired
to his room.’

The head of the United States Steel
corporation had complained of a ‘cold
earlier in the day, but he had hoped to
be able todeliver the speech he had
prepared. Toastmaster Charles _W.
Scovel arose‘ at the banquet, saying
that Judge Gary had been called from
theroom, and read the .steel execu-
tives" address, which follows, inipart:

“If is sometimes appropriate and useful to

have become more or less popular. A question-
able kind of success is often realized by the
individual or the publication whose energies
are devoted to frequent and furious personal
attacks against the standing or the action of
others. 

“The means of communication at the present

A GENTLE HINT.

 

 

The question in the minds of many
of the students at the present time

-seems to be, “When is a student ac-

tivity not a student activity?” and
the answer which we voice for the
students who have thought it, but left
it unexpressed is, “When an advisory
board for a certain activity takes over
all the management of that organiza-
tion, appoints its officers without the
consent of the members; decides who

shall and who shall not be members;

and continues the organization with-

out a constitution, using the students

only as tools for the glory or proﬁt

’ of the advisory board; then it ceases ,

to be a student activity and should
not be recognized as assisted by the
advisory board on student activity.
One of our supposed» student
organizations, now basking under the
sunlight of the approval of the ad-
visory board onstudent activities has
come very close to forfeiting its right,
under the above description, to be
termed a student organization. In
fact, there are those who claim that

* its right to be called a student or-

ganization is entirely forfeited by the
conditions which now exist in the
organization.

Such a condition is untenable if the
organization hopes to remain_a stud-
ent activity. We would suggest that
those men who have been accepted by

c the advisory board as members of this

organization for this year, should, be-
fore the club is disbanded, demand
their right to elect the officers for the
coming year and at the same time ap-
point or elect a constitutional com-

. mittee to prepare a document which

shall insure to the students their
proper rights in a student organiza-
tion. By so doing the present mem-
bers of the organization will render a
great service to the University by
keeping on the roster of student
activities one which has always been
a. credit to the University, but which
will necessarily be disbanded if condi-
tions within the organization are not

' changed.

THE WHY AND WHEREFORE

 

' -lPeriodically ~we . hear from one

source or a_nother, the complaint that
‘the.-fraternities run the student ac-

tivities and all other affairs around P

the University. That fraternity men
are very active in student affairs is
true. It is generally conceded, how-
ever, by those who know the facts,

 that these men are not in the student
.'organizations because they are ‘fra-
gteigiiity men, but they are fraterrlity

 because they have shown them-
ﬁﬁl s capable in some line of student

_.j_ <

  

ifrater-nitie_s«'-I might    ‘libel?’

 

activity.»  this r,were,_‘ not so *the
eligibility ‘rules. ‘ _.  ;  ‘_ ‘

Any"nian who knows anything at
all about fraternities, is aware of the
fact that men sometimes get in, be-
cause of the good offices of some re-
lation, who are not up to the standard
generally required by the fraternity.
When such men are accepted, the
fraternity at the same time accepts
the responsibility of fostering any
ability that the man may have until
he is’ able to make himself useful in
some activity, and it is a poor speci-
men of a man who has 1101.3 Some

‘; ability which if developed by his

associates will make him an accept-
able member in some organization of
students. ’ V ‘ ‘

On the other hand there is the fra-
ternity which tries, because of adverse
criticism, to keep out of the student
activities- Such a policy is _d€t1'l-
mental to the welfare ofthe Univers-
ity and should not be followed even
at the expense of getting-. some
criticism from the chronic kickers.
Fraternities are supposed to secure
as members as many as..pos_,Slb18 0_f
the" most capable men in the Uni-
versity. .If with such a membership
it withdraws from the student affairs,
those organizations and the Univers-
ity are harmed.

men who, for selﬁsh reasons, take advantage
of -this peculiar trait in human nature to
discover in one way or another something that

“But connected with the subject of criticism,
there is an agreeable truth which is worthy
of particular emphasis. There are at present
many able, honest and fearless editorial writers
who are in the habit of discussing the im-
portant questions of the day, who have the
ability to write forcibly and logically, and,
therefore, convincingly, who are conscientious
in their treatment of all questions strictly on
their merit; and who pass judgment with no
thought of fear or favor. They discriminate
between the good and the bad, the reasonable
and the unreasonable. These writers are hav-
ing a marked inﬂuence. They are more popu-
lar than ever before, for the public is quite
disposed to be fair and impartial; and the
number is increasing." —

circular letter to every student and
alumnus of Pitt that could be located
in Beaver county:—

University of "Pittsburgh students and
alumni who reside in Jefferson and
Westmoreland counties, we are pre-
aring to organize a BEAVER
COUNTY PITT CLUB, to which
Beaver county men and women who
are former students of the University,
or who are now attending there, are
eligible for membership.

“The purpose of the Club is to
“boost” the University in every‘ pos-
sible way and to help cement relations
between alumni, students and Alma
Mater. There are several hundred
alumni and students of “Pitt” in our
-county and it is felt that an organi-
zation of ' this kind’ can do an endless
amount of good. - '

“In addition to co—operating with the
University in its .eﬂ"orts to secure the
best high school graduates, interest-
ing the state legislators in the needs
of our school, and the necessity for a
liberal appropriation, etc., the Club
can plan social affairs periodically,
which will bind the Pitt men of Beav-
er county closer together. '

“For the purpose of organizing the
Club a dinner will be given at the
Tamaqua club, Beaver Falls, on Fri-
day evening, March 5th, at .7 io’colck,
which you are urged to attend. The
rate is $1.00 per plate. An excellent
menu has been provided. Several
prominent University authorities will
be present, including Chancellor Sam-
uel Black McCormick, who will tell
something of what the University has
accomplished in recent years and
plans for the future. . ‘
“Some «member of the Organization
Committee will see you personally be-
tween now and March 5th and secure
your ﬁnal word if you will attend.
Help the good cause along by being
there.

ance and make the BEAVER COUN-

In addition to the Chancellor, it‘ is

. expectedthat Dr. Walther Riddle, rep-

resenting the alumni, and Dr. T. S.
Arbuthnot Dean of the Medical
school, will attend‘ the meeting and
address the Beavercounty delegation.
There are many medical alumni in
the county who will be there and they
have asked that a medical school rep-
resentative be present.

DR. B. F. JENKINS, ’06.
Secretary-Treasurer
‘Westmoreland County Pitt Club.

After much trouble, we ﬁnally suc-
ceeded in getting a photograph of Dr.
Ben F. Jenkins, ’06, of Jeannette, Pa.,
for publication in THE WEEKLY.
Dr. Jenkins is Secretary of the West-
moreland County Pitt club and Was
largely responsible for the ﬁne turn
out we had when that organization
was formed at Greensburg. He is a
dyed-in-the-wool Pitt man and has al-
ways been aggressive in anything that
tended to boost his Alma Mater. The
only fault with Dr. Jenkins is his ex-
treme modesty _which, for a while,
threatened, to thwart all our efforts
to get a photo of him for’ these col-
umns.. Finally he relented,’ when we
'explained’that it was all for the good
;of the University. ‘ ,
,‘,Dr.*Jenkins ‘-is’ a graduate of the
Dental school, class of 1906. He has
a ﬁne dental practice in his home
town~—Jeannette———and is well known
and respected by all the townspeople
of that bustling burg. When an un-
dergraduate at the University, he was
active in all the student affairs and
managed the footlball team one year.

The J enkinsfamily is a Pitt family,
through and through, and two young-
er brothers have followed the foot-
steps of the Doctor. Howard F., grad-
uated last year from the Engineering
school. He, too, was a varsity foot-
ball manager—in 1913. A younger
brother, R. W. Jenkins, is now in the
University. We understand this is
the extent of the Jenkins clan, but it
is a safe bet that if there were any
iligiore: of them, they would come to

OLD ALUMNI AT -THE CHARTER
DAY BANQUET. V

Many old alumni-attended the Char-
ter Day banquet last Friday, the ac-
count of which appears in other col-
umns of THE WEEKLY._ The oldest
was J. T. Ilutton, who attended the
niversity back in 1845. Mr. Lutton
did not graduate from our institution
but he is very loyal to it nevertheless.
He is a member of the General Alumni
association.

Mr. Lutton is 86 years of age, but
is remarkably active. He was accom-
panied to the banquet by his daughter,
who told to the Secretary that her
father often talks of the University

keen interest for many years. Through
the courtesy of the ever obliging.s.Roy

an automobile to take Mr. Lutton to

moments of his life, as he‘ later "con-“’
ﬁded to friends. ' ,

Mr. Lutton had‘ one of his fondest
wishes gratiﬁed during the evening,
when he met‘ Dr. John A. Brashear.
Like the lovable “Pa,” he had worked
for a number of years in the mills of
Pittsburgh and he stated that he was
anxious to meet a man. who had gone
through a similar experience. When
the two grasped hands, Mr. Lutton
said, “Dr. Brashear, I have long
wanted an opportunity to look
through those telescopes of yours
over in Allegheny. I realize that I

‘ haven’t long to live and I want to see

the heavens before I pass to the
‘Great Beyond.’ ” With tears in his
eyes, Dr. Brashear gave the venerable
old alumnus a cordial invitation to
visit the Observatory and see the
many wonderful things his instru-
ments reveal. - ‘

The next oldest alumnus who at-
tended -was H. T. Morris, of the class
of 1869. Mr.‘ Morris is located in
Pittsburgli, his address being 2108
First_.National Bank building; George
H. Clapp, of the class of 1877, presi-
dent of the University’ Board of Trus-
tees, was the next oldest, and next to
him was Benjamin Thaw, of the class
of ’78. Other of the older alumni who
attended were as follows:—Edward
Thompson, ’80, Dr. J. J. Buchanan, ’81,
James B. Stevenson, ’82, Prof. Reid T.
Stewart, ’84, J. O. Horning, '86, G.

. H. Barbour, ’87, Samuel A. Taylor,

’87, G. A. Gilﬁllan, ’88, and R. T. Mc-
Cormick, ’88.

It~is indeed gratifying to get these
older alumni out to our University af-
fairs as it indicates that there hearts
are still with Alma Mater. It is also
an inspiration to the younger alumni
and to, the undergraduates’ to have
them with us. May they be spared to
attend many similar functions in the
future. --—-————————————-——

C. M. Johnston, chief chemist of the
Crucible Steel Company of America
and one of the greatest_ authorities
on iron and steel analysis in the
country, has been secured to ‘deliver
the opening address at the inaugural
meeting of the Chemical Society of
the University of Pittsburgh. “His
topic will be “Laboratory Electric
Furnaces and their Applications.”

Mr. Johnston is an old student in
the chemistry department of the uni-
versity, having taken his Ph. B. de-
gree in '89 and Ph. M. in 192.

In order to insure the complete suc-
cess of the lecture, Mr. Johnson will
have his furnaces brought out; they
will then be set up that the students
may see the furnaces in actual use.
Mr. Johnson, by the excellence and
thoroughness of his work along -in-
dustrial lines, has acquired a nation-
wide reputation. His book “The
Analysis of Special Steels” is said to
be the best work of its kind ever
published. He is also noted for having
simpliﬁed the electrical apparatus, so
as to reduce the cost and increase the
number of applications in the labor-
atory. He is a national authority on
the analysis of special steels.

Johnson, there will be a brief address
of welcome by R. F. Brenner, president
of the society, to the alumni.
tions have been sent out ‘to all faculty
members interested in chemistry;
Fellows in the Mellon Institute and
to all chemistry alnumni. Anyone in-
terested in chemistry may by sending
in his name become a member of the
society. -
The society is highly elated at their
good fortune in securing‘Mr. Johnson
initial address.
Silverman said: “We may consider
ourselves fortunate that the opening
lecture of the enlarged society is to
be given by a man so capable of con-
ducting researches and whose reputa-
tion is nation-wide. There is no
question that this will be one of the
very best lectures presented in the
university during the year.”

UNIVERSITY TO BE

The University will be represented
by Professor C. B. Robertson‘ at the
national conference on 'Extension
Education to be held in Madison, Wis;,
by the University of Wisconsin Ex-
tension Division next week from March
10th to March 13th. This conference
is the results of several year's cor-
respondence between the extension

As is always the case in_ engage-

the game was bitterly contested from

If the captain of the basket ball‘

team and one of his auburn haired
associates, the ﬁrst two letters of
whose name is Carlson, attack the
State men with the same ff31‘0C1l',y:'0f
expression and intention with which
they made the bayonet charge on the
Cider and Pretzels last Monday even-
ing, there can be further doubtas to
the outcome of the titular scrap.’

The Belgians and Poles, who are
reported to be starving have nothing
on the several members of the_ Wrestl-
ing team who have been existing. on a
curtailed diet for the past week in ‘an
attempt to reach the weight at which
they will grapple at State. A The center
country people might take a hint from
this fact and have copious eats pre-

pared for the meal’ immediately
succeeding the match. _ L

That the Dents clogged the Miner’s
shaft and that the cavity was well
ﬁlledwas the burden of some nervy
humorist’s communication. Should
his line of brilliancy be followed it
would ‘appear that the Medics now
consider an ‘operation necessary to re-
move the obstruction and restore the
functions of that vertical subway.

We should worry, even Jester
couldn’t make a joke out of Butch.

.A prui-ported interview with Charles
S. Miller, the Pitt Director of Athletes
quotes that dignitary as in favor of
the dance as a means of athletic de-
velopment. Such an opportunity
should not be wasted by the news
writer ‘with, the humoristic trend of
mind who so distorted the Pitt ideal
for the physical development of the
co‘-eds. ‘ '

BUCK LAND MID-ATLANTIC

BA*cAKsTRoK’E CHAMPION. 

Another distinctive athletic triumph

-was captured for Pitt last Friday

evening at the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association when Harold Buckland, of
the School of Mines, came into his own
through the winning of the Middle
Atlantic Championship “of the A. A.
U., in the one hundred fifty yard back-
stroke swimming contest in 2 minutes
and 1 second. , y

The other two entrents, M. Maisack,
representing the P. A. A., and R.
Vorret, unattached, proved to be easy
meat for the university stroker, for
hetook a_ lead over them early in the
race which he maintained until he
touched the ﬁnishing stone, nearly a
quarter of the pool’s length ahead of
his nearest "competitor.

The winning of this triumph in a
time which breaks all former records
by nearly two seconds puts Buckland
in the National Championship Contest
which is soon to be staged on the
scene of Buckland’s latest victory.

MINERS_ SWAMP DENTS;
MEDICS CHALLENGE.

The Medics have challenged the
representative basket ball team of the
Mines school to a game which it is
understood will decide the champion-
ship of‘ the inter-school contest. The
date of the game has not as yet been
decided, but interest will be centered
in the game, because of the fact that
the shaft diggers decisively defeated
the Dents in an exciting clash on the
evening of Monday last, by a score of
34-16. I
The game was marked throughout
y the star playing of Cook and Dil-
lon for the? Mine aggregation. while
MacChesney captured the stellar
honors of the Dent squad, and by the
rooting of the members, of the two
supporting schools who were in at-
téiidance. The lineup of the teams
was aslfollows:

On February 27, ‘Miss Gretchen B.

AVALANCHE  
OVERWHELMS
  JUNIATA

After taking Juniata’s_ dust during
most of the ﬁrst half of the game at
Huntingdon last Saturday night, the
Varsity sleepers awoke and bestirred

contest into a procession, and ﬁnally
winning out by a scire of 55 to 26.
Juniata took the lead at the start,
and held‘ it until nearly the end of the
opening period. With four or ﬁve
minutes left to play in this chapter,
the Varsity system underwent a com-
plete change, and Pitt baskets became
more plentiful than dead men in
Poland. ' In face of this terriﬁc attack,
Juniata’s defense went to pieces, and
utter rout ensrued.y The ﬁrst half
ended“ 22 "to 15 in Pitt’s favor; the
second half was even more ghastly,
the Varsity total reaching 33 in this
period, to 11 for Juniata. .
Graham, Healy and Ochsenhirt each
scored ﬁve ringers, Healy’s work being
particularly’ spectacular. A As in the
game played at Huntingdon last year,
the red-headedwas all over the ﬂoor,
and his passing played a heavy part
in the big ‘win. 1 The big factor from
the Pitt point of view, however, was
the teamwork. With the exception of
the ﬁrst ten or twelve minutes, this
was hardly susceptible to improve-
ment. ‘ , . '
The big gun, for J uniata was Captain
Manbeck, while Baker also showed to
advantage, especially during theearly

stages of the game. The lineup:

VARSITY. PASSERES. ..

 H *» MEET ‘TECI-I€’AGA'I’N'.

 

The Varsity tossers cross the ravine
tonight to do battle with the wearers"
of the Carnegie plaid. Tech’si scalp
was the ﬁrst on‘ Pitt’s belt this year,
and tonight’s game should mean an-
other victory on the list. The Fresh-
men oughtgto be good for a win, too,
with the Tech Plebes scheduled for
opposition-. The ﬁrst game begins at
seven thirty, the Varsity tangle being
scheduled for an hour later.

_ Since the early season mess with
Pitt, the Plaid team has been taken
under the wing of ‘Al” Wagner,
brother of the immortal Hans. The
immortal himself devotesia part of‘his
time in coaching the Tech hopefuls.
The Carnegie ﬁve have responded to
the Wagnerian treatment by improv-
ing materially in their play and should
give the Varsity a harder run than
before. The ﬁnal result, however,
should have a distinctly Gold and Blue
tinge. ‘

A FRESHMAN CLASH.

 

 

The Freshman basket ball team in-
vaded the conﬁnes of‘ Ohio and re-

20. Rayen high school hasaalways
had a ‘good team and this year is no
exception. The game was ‘marked
with some very hard playing and fouls
were frequent. The ﬁrst yearmenv
make "a hard fight but could not "keep
up the pace and lost out in the last
half. _ A D D
Undismayed by this defeat the men
are making sprinted preparations for
the second contest with. the Tech
Plebes of the.Plaid school. The game
will be played as a preliminary to
the main game of the evening. Satur-
day night they ‘Will play Coraopolis
there. Both of these games should be
closer than they were in the previous
meetings. The games will be played
away from home and will place the
Freshmen at a disadvantage.
