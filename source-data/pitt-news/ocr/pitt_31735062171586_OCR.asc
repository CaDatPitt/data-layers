 A Major Controversy

by DON MARBURY
Editor

University expansion is now a

"*major controversy. More specifi-

cally a Hillside Dormitory Com-
plex in the Pitt Stadium area
scheduled to be completed by ear-
ly Fall of 1973 is now a major

controversy. The area that will be _

affected is along Schenley Farms.
Brackenridge. Alequipa. and Ava-
lon Streets. and a stretch of L'ni-
versit_v Drive.

According to a lfniversity state-
ment. the Master Plan for the
complex was prepared during the
period 1966-68. It is planned to
house 1.300 students and will be
an 80—story complex. with an es-

calator system which directs the
flow of pedestrian traffic from
the dorms down to O'Hara St. A
parking lot for ;‘):30 cars is also
part of the $13.4 million project.

But the University’s right to
construction of the dormitory has
been challenged by an organiza-
tion of residents and students, fac-
ulty of the Oakland area, called
People’s Oakland.

Tenrporarily housed in the [hi-
versity and City Ministries Build-
ing on Forbes Ave.. the organiza-
tion is an outgrowth of a smaller

Registration Procedures Revised

by MICHAEL SIMON
The School of General Studies.

V _ sometimes viewed as the black
i sheep of the University family. is
undergraduate‘ night .

the only
school at Pitt that also has day
classes.

The school is also unique in the
aspect that it is primarily design-
ed for the part-time adult evening
student. This almost automatical-
ly limits the enrollment to stu-
dents in surrounding Western
Pennsylvania areas. as the stu-
dents have jobs and families to
support.

“Of the students that enroll
here." said David Masoner. as-
aistant to the dean in charge of
Credit Programs. “64 per
cent are enrolled in degree pro-
grams. which on the average
takes about five to six years to
achieve due to the part-time stat-
us of‘ the students."

The remaining 34 per cent
are either here for enrichment,
advancement, or are not sure if
they want a degree.

To help the students enroll and
to save time. a system of mail
registration was innovated at
SGS. Approximately one—half of
the total Winter Term enrollment
used the innovative process.

Plans are to expand the mail
registration to the 1100-1200 new-
ly admitted students.

Masoner indicated, “Other new
programs have been instituted or

are being developed to keep SGS

as up to date as possible.”

A few of these programs in-
clude 30 new courses and 108 ad-
ditional courses. a new faculty

present advising facilities. and
the credit no entry option.

Some possible new major
studies plans are Environmental
Science. Social Work. and Admin-
istrative Justice.

One of the problems plaguing
the SGS is th_e fact that there is an
“inexplicable hostility” between
SGS, Student Government and
the administration.

Bob Comfort. assistant to the
dean in charge of Continuing Ed-
ucation. could not explain the hos-
tility but did speak of Student Gov-
ernments recent progress and
the administrations attempts to
achieve an understanding with
SG.

“Our Student Government."
Comfort began. “has a new. _vet
to be ratified constitution. and
has committees planning new so-
cial and cultural functions. The
administration." he continued.
"is planning a faculty student SGS
Council Board to discuss prob-
lems of both administration and
students."

The, as yet, unexamined side of
SGS is the ever increasing non-
credit programs handled by Bob
Comfort.

Included in the offerings is a
series of informal courses and
lectures on subjects ranging from
Food Preparation to Philosophy
which is open to virtually anyone
who can foot the average 25 dol-
lar cost.

Also in the Personal Enrich-
ment plans are a series of world
tours going to Russia. the Orient.
and Scandinavia.

“Next,” Comfort stated, “is a

land is supported by the South
Oakland Citizens Council. the
Pittsburgh .\'eighborhood Alli-
ance. Nlodel Cities. and the l*‘alk
School Parents.

The specific complaints of Peo-
ple's Oakland members deal with
problems which they see occuring
in the community from traffic
and people congestion. strained
utilities. noise and environmental
pollution. moral and environmen-
tal danger to the Falk School
grade school children.

People’s Oakland contends that
there are already severe traffic
problems on Alequipa St. and that
the building will just add more
problems to the community of
about 60 families, 250 Falk
School students and 20-30 faculty
members, with an added average
of 15 visitors per day, 1,200 em-
ployes of Veterans Hospital, and
683 patients with “untold” vis-
itors and persons conducting hos-
pital business. “We are talking
about 4,000 people per day on
roughly a three block area border-
ing on the 25 feet wide Alequipa
St.," they contend.

Dennis Casey. associate direc-
tor of News and Publications at
the L'niversit_v. pointed to the 550-
car parking lot. which the l.'niver-
sity is planning to build and the es-
calator. which would take stu-
dents to the center of the campus
area. as reasons the automobile

Under development in the Ca

Theory. Jazz Improvisation and
Children's Literature.

The final heading under Com
fort°.S jurisdiction is a "Profes
sional Development Series. Work
shops in personnel counselin
and actual experience with profes
sional organizations are given.

The up and coming SGS is still
as David Masoner puts it, “tryin
to break away from the concep
tion that we are a baby Colleg
of Arts and Sciences.”

Both Comfort and Masoner
however. were confident that th
new innovations and program
would help dispel the schools ol
image.

Tickets for Freak Week are
still on sale at the Student Un-—
ion Ticket Olfice. The $5 pur-
chase price includes the Satur-
day and Sunday concerts at
the Syria Mosque, dances in
the Towers lobby, and the

tacular Saturday in the Com-

People's Oakland cite. will not
take place.

University spokesmen claim
that from a survey undertaken to
find out how many students would
have cars on campus. they esti-
mated that only a hundred park-
ing spaces would be needed. be-
cause only 200 students of 3.400
requested spaces in the Towers
Garage. So the University feels
that the 550 parking spaces on the
hillside will be more than enough.
Plus if the need arises a recently
acquired cemetery plot near the
proposed dorms could be used for
that purpose. officials say.

People’s Oakland counters that
when the University took the sur-
vey they did not ask how many
students had cars on campus,
which they feel would have been
a far better indication of how
much traffic to expect.

Their basic demand is that con-
struction of the new dorms be held
off. and that plans he reevaluated.
but with student anti community
input.

The University takes the posi-
tion that the time element is a big
factor while holding off construc-
tion might not be feasible. Money
has already been allocated for the
complex.

Casey also added that when the
l-‘niversity became state-related
it undertook the obligation to the
state that would eventually handle

ed up.

Student Seats Sought /

by SUE HOENSTINE

Obvious clamorings for student power began diminshing at least
a year ago. However. student representation on the Board of Trustees
was part of the power issue and is still under consideration today.

William Rea. president of the Board of Trustees, and Bernard Kop-
erek. director of Development and Alumni Affairs, both agree that stu- V
dent representation on the Board is possible. But they also feel that stu-
dent misconceptions concerning the Board's processes must be ‘clear-

40.000 students including the
regional campuses. He said that
of today in Oakland there are 27.-
200 graduate and undergraduate
students. and the University is
short 400 housing units for this
term alone.

"Where the hell you gonna put
them.“ he queries. "If we start
cutting now more and more kids
won‘t be able to go to school."

Vice Chancellor for Finance,
Edison Montgomery also takes is-
sue with the People’s Oakland
claim that the public was not
adequately informed of the Uni-
versity plans, considered in the
planning process, or asked for in-
puts.

Montgomery pointed out that in
1968 the plan was revealed to
the public through the news me-
dia and public meetings. He also
mentioned that Pittsburgh Model
Cities was involved in the plan-
ning process from its outset. and
was asked directly for its inputs.

Dan Viven. the area Model
Cities director in Oakland. re-
sponds that some of the plans
were in affect before Model Cities
was even brought in and that
their function eventually amount-
ed to “after-the-fact participa-
tion. The University should not
have assumed that Model Cities
Oakland represented all of Oak-
land." Diven went on. »

(Uontirzued on Page 2)

Quick to point out that students are already represented on Board
committees, Rea asserted that most committee action is ratified by
the Board. The Trustees’ president declared that since students have
influenced committee decisions, actual student votes on the board
really don't prove much. The Board’s whole process is one of consen-
sus and committee decisions are ratified by consensus. Voting is the '
least important part of the process and student influence on commit-
tees is as powerful as a board vote.”

In Kopereks opinion. "If students want a place on the Board they
should show that they can help maintain the resources of the Univer-
sity and can provide a serious input to the board." Koperek believes
that the Board has a responsibility to maintain the institutions re-

"Students have the opinion that the Board is deciding their fates.
when really what is right for the students is not the concern of the ,
Board." Koperek attested. He continued. “Most student activism is
directed at political issues" and "the majority of things that students
are interested in must be handled on the administrative level."

After inferring that alumni question the value of students on the
Board of Trustees, Koperek stressed the fact that the Alumni Council
would support the issue “if students could convince them that they
could help in the gathering and maintaining of the University’s re-

Commenting that students could provide new. innovative ideas.

Koperek concluded. "If I were on the Board of Trustees I would wel- i
come any help I could get. And I think that a well conceived program of

Sides React Concerning
Hillside Dormitories
. (Continued from Page I)
Peoples Oakland take the position that “news releases are no

' longer enough to inform the people directly involved. particularly when
7 plans are presented and changed constantly."

In defending their position the University also points out that Pitt's

 , ‘student community played a large part in the planning process of the
__Hi1lside dormitories. ’

Kimberly Fellner. a University graduate student in t,‘ommunica-

‘ Q tions and an organizer in the Peoples Oakland movement. reported

 that some of the students who were originally in on the planning stages

, j of the complex were contacted. and said that they did. indeed. help to
‘‘.layout the Hillside Dormitory Master Plan as it is outlined today. "But
’ i only after they had all their other options cut out.:' she continued.

A, “The students reported that they came up with ideas for co-op
apartment housing, but were told that it‘couldn’t be implemented,” she
said.

’ People‘s,Oakland also claim that a 1968 student survey reveal-

lijv-‘ed’ that “students didn‘t care much for dormitor_v living." and that is
‘also indicated that the University should involve a variety of high and

low cost rental units as well as actively involve private housing inter-

‘ - ests on a substantial scale.

The University has repeatedly stated that it has no intentions of

O expanding its educational facilities beyond the boundary lines indicated

on the master plan. but Peoples Oakland counters this statement with

,  the query of how the University can even be sure of such a thing since
,_ . I -its policies are constantly changing with every change in the Chancel-
 lor and high echelon staff members and faculty 1’ _
j I «The case of Peoples Oakland lies in the belief that the Lniversity
‘  has not taken a responsible enough position in relation to its commun-
_ _ ,ity. “It is not a question of whether the Lfniversity should expand or
 :,, not." Miss Fellner said. “but more how it is to expand." She says the
I . Way it looks the University wants to make the “whole Oakland commun-
' ‘ ity one large institution."

THE BLACK ACTION SOCIETY in conjunction with.the NAACP, Black Studies Department, and the YMCA
have planned a program commemorating the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King on Friday, Jan. I5. Dr.
Martin Luther King, the assasinated leader of the Black movement, on this day will be commemorated for
his part in the struggle of Black people during his life time.

Organizers of the event impress the point that the commemoration will emphasize that Dr. Kings’
works, his hopes, and goals for Black people are still untulfilled—-—that the Black struggle is still strongly con-
tinuing. They said for these reasons the program will deal with all facets of society which can be used to
promote change for oppressed peoples.

University Opens Testing Center

by POHLA SMITH

A new service department has
been added to the University. The
Office of Measurement and Eval-
uation was established in July as
part of the Division of _Instruc—
tional Experimentation to pro-
vide the l'niversit_v community
with services concerned with test-
ing and student evaluation.

The Office. which is under the
direction of Dr. Richard C. (fox.
associate professor of education.
has three main functions. These
are test administration. test

scoring and analysis. and re-
search consultation.

'l‘he responsibility of adminis-
tering all standardized tests. such
as the Graduate Record exams
and law boards. once the task of
the former University Testing
Service. has been assumed by the
Office. Students who are required
to take special tests. such as‘ the
Miller Analogies Test. can make
arrangements with the Office on
an individual basis.

has the facilities to promptly
score standardized objective tests
for professors and teaching assis-
tants. The service is done without
charge.

Members of the staff. graduate
students in Psychology and Edu-
cation Research. analyze the tests
to find the mean scores. variancet,
reliability. and other pertinent in-
formation. In addition such ques-
tion is analyzed as to how many
students answered it correctly
and in the case of multiple choice
questions. how many students
chose each particular answer.
With this information. professors
can revise their tests and improve
them. .

The staff is also available to
work with members of the teach-

design more accurate tests. Dr.
Cox emphasized the importance
of this service. "It will help us
reach the ultimate goal of educa-
tion—-better instruction." he de-
clared. "Test analysis allows
profs to see how well they have

Promises Fair Election

by BOB norm

In an apparent attempt to elim-
inate the extended hassles over
last year's SG elections. a new
election code has been_ drawn up
for this years contest by the Stu-
dent Government Elections Com-
mittee lSGECl.

One important clause in the
new code eliminates the possi-
bility of candidates preparing
giant. expensive campaigns. All

 electioneering will be limited to

signs on University bulletin
boards and to personal contacts.

A clearly-defined appeals sys-
term is included in this draft also.
Challenged elections may be
taken first to the SGEC and then

to the student members of thee

Billing
Method
Altered

In a move aimed at saving
money for some students. the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh will change
its method of billing tuition
charges for the third term.
Under the new method. all stu-
dents will be billed on a per-
credit basis. regardless of how
many credits the student is tak-
ing. Under the old system. stu-
dents were charged by the credit
up to a certain number of cre-
dits. and then they were charged
a flat rate for credits above that
amount. For undergraduates. the
cutoff point was six credits: for
graduate students. the cutoff
point was five credits. during
each of the two sessions in the
third term.
The old practice had resulted
in some seeming inequities. For
example. an undergraduate Penn-

‘. xsylvania resident taking a three-

credit course was charged $90.
while an undergraduate out-of-
state student was billed $210.
However. if the student took six
credits. he was charged half the
full tuition rate —- $212.50 for
Pennsylvania residents. and $490
for out-of-staters.

With the new billing system.
six credits would cost a Penn-
sylvanian $180 and. an out-of-
stater $420.

The new billing method will
be used only during the third
term. ‘

Other important features of the
new elections code are that the
SGEC will initiate at least three
debates during the campaign. that
all campaign materials must indi-
cate a source. and that the SCEC
will be entrusted with the author-
ity to see that mere technicali-
ties do not interfere with the
due process of an election.

In order to familiarize the can-
didates with the new elections
code and to help avoid uninten-
tional malfeasance during elec-
tion time. the SGEC has set up
three dates for briefing. All can-
didates are required to attend at
least one of them.

Students may vote in the elec-
tion next Wedneaday by showing
either their term validation. their
pink course election record. or an
official photostatic copy of their
pink slips. ‘

S I    YMCA iriiéoject Perspective’ 

Program to Bridge Gap-if

The campus YMCA. in cooper-
ation with the Pittsburgh Cliam-
ber of Commerce. has launched a
program designed to break down
role playing and bridge the gen-
eration gap between businessmen
and students.

Project Perspective, according
to spokesman ‘Joe Blasi. is in-
tended to appeal to the "counter
culture. by exploration in con-
frontation . "

“It is not for people who have '

industrial decor. i.e. students with
an eye to a future in business."
he said.

The coordinating committee.
which includes Y members Ran-
dy Bennett. Jack Polack. Dan Al-
ton. Y Executive Director Tom
Huff and Blasi. sees the pilot

project as a basic model for social

change.

In describing the essence of
the Project, the committee felt
that "implicit in Project Per-
spective is the belief that if we
do not have more occasions to
communicate and understand
each other. then the only direc-
tion for change is one based on
power. pressure and control in a
society that was begun with the
hope that the people would be
free to take time for each other".

cer. 'l‘ed Hleba. Director of fidu-
cational Affairs. has sent out

Page 4-—THE PITT NEWS—Wednesday, January 13, 1971,

Editorial

People’s Oakland has a strong case against the University ad-
ministration concerning the construction of the proposed Hillside
Dormitories on Allequippa Street. and concerning the general uni-
versity attitude towards the community which surrounds it.

The Chancellor has stated many times concerning many differ-
ent controversies that have arisen over the years. that he sees a lack
of and a great need for more meaningful University-—Community re-
lationships, yet it appears that this attitude is not reflected in the
University‘s expansion policies.

People’s Oakland has cited many reasons why the Hillside Dor-
mitories should not be constructed, as planned, and only ask the
University to reconsider the plans with community inputs. But the
University remains content to wait and abide by the ruling of the

‘City Planning Commission, which will be the aftermath of a Janu-
‘ ary 21 public hearing in the Public Safety Building Downtown.

The Pitt News feels that the University is not considering the
community in the Hillside Dormitory situation. Although the plans
were madeback in 1968 we do not feel that the public was ade-
quately involved or informed of them. for the University to now cal-
lously carry them out.

The University claims that the plans were well publicized over
the years, through open hearings and the news media.

If this is the case then the question must be asked, was this an

— adequate way to inform thecommunity? Did the University in fact

make an attempt to go into the community, and tell the residents on

the Hillside that by 1973 1300 students would be living in their

neighborhood; housed in a large institutional complex?

Different representatives on the administration side have voiced
the question; "why are they complaining now. with initiation of the
project so close at hand. and money already appropriated for con-
struction? Why didn't they speak up before?"

Is it not the University which is going into the community to
expand, and not the community coming into the University? So is
it not the University’s duty to try and solicite opinion from the com-
munity, and not for the community to approach the University: ask-
ing can they have a voice in whether their community is to be up-
set or not?

Up until now, the main concern of the University of Pittsburgh
administration has been its relationship to its students. We submit
the concept that this is no longer enough, and that an urban institu-
tion, the size of Pitt must also carefully consider its relationship
also with the community which surrounds it. *

We can appreciate the University's position on the importance
and necessity for expansion. but we must question the how of that
expansion process. Surely. the University must provide or find places
for its students to live. but in the process. they must not take away
or hinder the life processes of its community.

We contend that the plea by People's Oakland to the adminis-
tration that they consider the plans with community input is not an
unreasonable request. and that the University do as they ask. irreg-
ardless of the Planning Commission decision. Although funds have
already been appropriated. we feel that avoiding the situations
which would exist in the community resulting from the inception of
the proposed Hillside Dormitory Plan is well worth the financial
loss which the University would incur. ‘ '

Why must the community and the University be structurally
isolated from one another? The University does not always have to
look at the expansion question in relation to the community with
the philosophy, “It’s either the community or the students who are
going to stiffer.”

There is a medium. The University can expand in the Oakland
area and avoid making it one large institutional complex. with the
community totally alienated in little isolated corners.

Why not incorporate the University into the community. Build
facilities to house both students and residents of the community.
The concept of the “centralized university.“ is outdated. and has
only alienated the community from the University—bringing about
groups like the Briar Bowl Gang.

Students are not something special. They want to be part of the
communities from which they came as well as students.

The educational process. is not something which should take
place "behind closed doors." and then after a certain period of
time. say four years. the results revealed to the society outside. High-
er education takes place for the basic enhancement of society. Is it
not contradictory then for the University to hold the belief that for

,that higher education to have any positive effect on society for a

certain period of time. while the education process is going on. it
must be isolated from society ‘?

The manner in which the buildings and facilities of the Univer-
sity are physically situated now. promote this isolationist attitude.

People’s Oakland point out that a recent study of students in

the area, show that they do not _want dormitory living—that they are

more interested in co-op housing and apartments.

Chancellor Posvar. today‘s truly concerned and involved student
no longer want to be isolated from society. They know that the col-
legeexperience is not a four year forget-the-world-outside. I-belong-
to-something-different-now thing.

The Hillside Dormitory controversy is as good a place as any
for the University to begin. People’s Oakland have both the inter-
ests of the community and those of the University in mind. They
have some really fine ideas concerning our expansion. Will the
University of Pittsburgh start looking at and considering the thing
it was established to ultimately serve?

The Pitt News urges the University administration to postpone
plans for the Hillside Dormitories. and begin again. but this time
with the community actively involved. We also believe that it would
be a strong gesture of sincerity on the University side. if they an-
nounced this intention before the Planning Commission hearing.

The University and the community are both to important to each
other to be at odds with each other. One can not effectively exist
without the other in this society. We must seek to humanize our in-
stitution for if we don‘t it will become -even more inhuman than it

‘S’ See the community as a part of the whole. .

Installment number one deals
with the Skyscraper Engineer;
Installment two will discuss the
latest production .of Studio Thea-
tre, The Fantasticks.)

By VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Two invitations to accept the
risks and rewards of moral lea-
dership were advanced on cam-
pus last week; one was weighed
by an individual who was forced
to re-examine awhole lifetime of
socialized attitudes; the other.
an indirect appeal. was disre-
garded in ignorance.

Several weeks ago. it came to
the attention of Dana Ventrig-
lia. staff writer for The Pitt
News, Esther Kitzes. Director of
Student Publications and myself
that the University's official en-
gineering magazine. Skyscraper
Engineer, had fora number of
years been running as a regular
insert. a feature entitled. Tech-
nicutie.

Technicutie, usually three or
four pages in length. was a ser-
ies of glossy photographs. fea-
turing a campus woman in stud-
ied poses. A la Playboy. the wom-
en were labelled with the names
of the concurrent months.

In most cases, the photograph-
ed women were fully clothed.
However, an issue published ear-
ly last term portrayed a female
poised around the Cathedral
fountain and clad in a brief bi-
kini.

At the request of the three

’women. a meeting was called

with the Executive Board of Sky-
scraper. Attendant at the session.
besides those who requested it.
were incoming editor. Dick ‘Be-
swick. business manager. Mitch-
ell Pines. faculty advisors Minor

Hawk. Assistant Dean of the Ci-
vil Engineering Department. Dr.
Paul Fulton. Associate Chair-
man of the Chemical and Pe-
troleum Engineering Depart-
ments. John Burk.‘ Assistant to
the Dean of the School of Engin-
eering and a few observers.

"I understand that both women
and men have been raised to see

women as sex objects." Beswick .

said. in introducing the proceed-
ings. "I don‘t agree with every-
thing that Women‘s Lib wants.
and I guess that I don't under-
stand everything. But I realize
that we‘ve all been socialized to
accept society‘s roles."

Ventriglia pointed out that the
magazine reinforces stereotyped
attitudes by emphasizing the bio-
logical attributes of females to
the exclusion of intellectual traits.

"But that is what sells Sky-
scraper to the engineers." arg-
ued Pines. “The great majority
of the engineering students.
around 98 per cent. are men.
They like this feature and pro-
bably read the magazine because
it is there."

Beswick concurred. comment-
ing that “sex is an important
part of life and I don't see how
Women‘s Lib is going to change
that“.

“This isn't a question of set,
but sexual exploitation. It’s ob-
vious that the photographs, even
those in which the women are
more clothed than in the lattest

.ones, are designed to stimulate

sexual interest.” I retorted.
“We resent the fact that, point

one you are using women’s bod-‘

ies to attract readership and
point two you are using pictures
of exposed females to feed the
sexual fantasies of your male
readers.”

"Don‘t you see the immorality
in using women‘s bodies to push

your magazine? questioned Ven-‘
triglia. "If you can‘t sell the pub-
lication to your readers on the
basis of its intrinsic quality and
its relevance to the lives of your
readers. then why do you keep
publishing?

The question of the male or-
ientation of Skyscraper and its
relation in general to male dom-
ination in the field of engineer-
ing was broached by Dr. Fulton.
Fulton suggested that the Tech-
nicutie feature be replaced by a
series of articles and perhaps an
entire issue designed to attract
women to the discipline.

He wasiquick to add, however, ‘

that his proposal was a suggest.
tion, stressing that "the students
have complete control over the
magazine. I don‘t want this to be
taken as a censorship attempt."

"We are not asking that the ad-
ministration or the faculty con-
trol the magazines content. Ra-
ther. we are asking for a big-
ger committment — that as the
campus must lead the way to so-
cial change. students like your-
self must be willing to accept,»
the moral responsibility that is
part and parcel of leadership.
especially in the realm of pub-
lications." I suggested.

The meeting lasted into the
afternoon and at its end, editor
Beswick and bubiness manager
Pines decided: (I) to remove
the Technicutie feature and re-
place it with articles dealing
with recruitment of female and
black engineers
ideas (2) to reconsider the con-
tent of the jokes that are charac-
teristically inserted at the back
of the magazine, and (3) to in-
vite Dana and myself to describe
in writing for the Skyscraper our
objections to the feature and our
philosophies in general concern-
ing Women’s Liberation.

I Expansion

By BOB GING
News Editor

The University is on the verge
of a new phase in the expansion
of its physical plant. and is at
the same time entering a new
phase in community conflict.

Vocal disagreement with the
administration is once again
surfacing at the University. and
many of the questions now being
asked are not new. but merely
redirected.

In an open meeting of students.
faculty and administrators. in
February 1969. the question was
posed "Is the University a cor-
poration or an institution based
on the search of truth? If it is a
corporation. let‘s unionize. If we
are searching for the truth. then
it's not their University but ours."

This meeting began a series
of confrontations with the admin-
istration which ended with the
liberation of the Common Facili-
ties Building, and forceful evic-
tion of its occupiers by court in-
junction.

To many members of the Uni-

versity community. the eventual
capitulation of the administration.

 

   

conflict an old story

and its cooperation in setting up
a free University put an end to
the conflict. but the question of
University control remained un-
answered.

Decisions such as where and
how the University is to expand
are still beyond the grasp of
students and members of the Oak-
land community. The problem
today is not who runs the Uni-
versity, but who runs the com-
munity.

It is all too obvious who runs
the University: the Board of Trus-
tees. the Chancellory. and the
State legislature (many of whose
members are also Trustees). One
is curious as to what these men
would have to say if some large
institution decided to expand
into their neighborhoods.

If the students and community
fail to keep the University from
running rampant in it's expansion
policies, we will have set a pre-
cedent giving any institution the
right to take away from citizens
who have no recourse against
“progress” the homes and en-
vironment necessary for the
peaceful growth of a family.

   

 

If this goes on unchecked the
doorways left open to government
expansion are almost infinite.

The connection between the
control of the University and the
control of the community is very’
simple. Previously, the battle for
some say in what things were to
shape our futures was fought in
the ivy halls. Now. the battle
lines are being drawn in the
streets.

To many of us, the frustrations
of the Oakland community are of
no consequence. We are trans-
ients, who pass through Oakland
for a few years and move on, to
become productive, affluent
members of our society.

We are processed by the great
education machine and sent to
one of the sheepskin suburbias
that have been created to shelter
us.

Ideally. an institution of high-
er education is one where the
search for truth and a meaning.-
ful life are the ultimate goals.
An institution which places a

greater value on expansion and 
progress than on the welfare of

(Editor's Note: The Pitt News is priming
the following information on birth control
methods as a service to the students. The edi-
tors want to emphasize, however, that the
explanations below deal only with the ef-
fectiveness ol the various methods. The in-
dividual woman is urged to seek medical ad-
vice before experimenting. Most birth con-
trol methods, notably the pill and the IUD,
require individual attention in order to lul-
lill their predicted effectiveness. The
rhythm method has not been included.)

by CAROL KRUPA

Until recent years birth control meth-
ods were shrouded in folklore and handed
down from mother to daughter indiscreet-
ly. Regardless of what decisions a couple
make concerning birth control it is still ad-
visable to know something about contra-
ceptives.

Birth control pills are the easiest and
most effective method of conception con-
trol available to women. The pill achieves
fertility by preventing or suppressing ovul-
ation. Ovulation is the release or rupture
of a female egg from a mature egg follicle.

This release of the egg depends on hor-
monal influences generated from the pitui-
tary gland and the ovaries themselves.
Ovulation can result in fertilization within
a period of three days. The pill is made of

a steroid chemical—a synthetic drug which
closely resembles the natural hormones
estrogen and progesterone produced by the
woman's ovaries.

During pregnancy the hormone proges-
terone prevents ovulation which keeps the

woman from having several fertilized eggs’

of different ages competing for the wom-
an’s resources in the womb. The pill, on the
same principles, duplicates this ovulation-
suppression action and this makes it pos-
sible to prevent pregnancy.

Contraceptive pills are taken 20 or 21
days each month. The first day of men-
strual bleeding is labeled "day one" and
‘day five" the first pill is taken. The pill is
taken daily for 20 more days. then stopped
for seven days.

The procedure is followed every men-
struation cycle. beginning on the fifth day.
If even one day‘s medication is forgotten.
the woman has a slight chance of becoin—
ing pregnant. If she desires pregnancy. all

she has to do is stop taking the pill and her -

previous fertility is restored in the suc-
ceeding cycle.

There are two types _of pills—the com-
bination and the sequential. The combina-
tion contains both progesterone and estro-
gen in one pill, while the sequential con-
tains estrogen for the first 14 pills and
progesterone for the last seven oills.

A Bird’s- Eye View of Available irth Control Methods

Intrauterine devices are second only to
the oral contraceptives in effectiveness.
They come in many shapes and are usually
made of flexible plastic. They all. however.
must be straightened to permit insertion
through the narrow canal of the undilated
cervix. and once inside the uterus they re-
turn to their original shape.

There are many theories about why the
presence of the IUD in the uterus prevents
conception. but no one knows definitely
why it works

INSERTING THE IUD

It is a simple. rapid. painless pro-
cedure.

Most doctors find it difficult. however.
to insert an IUD into a woman who has
never been pregnant since the uterus is
smaller and its entrance tighter. They pre-
fer to recommend some other form of birth
control.

The lUD’s greatest advantage is that it
remains in place for an indefinite period
and there’s no need for further contracep-
tive precautions. The couple is unaware of
the presence of the device.

Among married women. the combina-
tion vaginal diaphragm and spermicidal was
the most popular form of contraception un-
til the pill came on the market. There are
several forms and constructions of dia-

J i"

phragms but the most recently developed‘ A
are crescent shaped ones which spring into
close contact with tissue around the cervix.

It is most important that the diaphragm
be properly fitted to the individual wom-
an‘s requirements. It is designed to fit
snugly between the bone forming the for-
ward part of the pelvis—the symphis—and

the vaginal tissues covering the end of the i 

spine; this distance varies considerably in
different women.

The diaphragm forms a partition whose
edges stretch the vaginal walls so that the
penis cannot pass between the front edge of
the device and the wall of the vagina. The
spermicidal preparation is commonly put
in the dome of the cup so that when the dia-
phragm is inserted into the vagina it keeps .
the preparation in contact with the uterine
opening.

The chemical kills any sperm which

may pass the rim. though the rim itself is 

not coated with the preparation. Anyone
who uses a diaphragm should have it's
size checked once a year. as well as after
having a baby. a miscarriage. a gynecolog-
ical operation. or a weight gain or loss of
10 pounds or more.

Condoms were probably the most pop-

ular contraceptive product in the US. be-" I

The Panthers return to the Pitt basketball court tonight with Carl Morris
back in action. Morris, who starred in the Cager opener against Gettys-
burg, has had a lot of trouble with his knee, forcing him to miss a few of

partment and a ‘white Athletic
Department. The Athletic De-
partment eant do that. its team-
work—-- you have to co-relate."

Ballard, however, says that the
BAS is not seeking a divided de-
partment. In fact, an Assistant
AI) will be acceptable if the
man is permitted to handle ef-
fectively the problems of the
Black athlete.

As an assistant the man
wouldn't really have the stature
to give him the necessary re-
spect.“ Ballard says. The title
is important. but not as impor-
tant as the function. You could
call him an assistant and he
could still be performing the
type of duties «of assuring equal
treatment l . “

.VIy'slinski mentions that he has
been concerned about the prob-
lems of the Black athlete. and he
claims to have been searching for
a Black administrator.

“We’ve been looking for a
qualified man,” he says. "And
we’ve had plans speeded up.

We feel we need somebody high-
er up because we have some-
body down lower.“

The Athletic Department em-
ploys three “Assistants to the
Athletic Director.“ and the new
Black mans duties would be
most similar to those now hand-
led by Bob Rosborough. who
manages recruitment and schol-
arship data for Myslinski.

The general belief is that
.\lyslinski has tight control over
everything in the Field House
offices of the Athletic Depart-

ment. So the big question be-
comes. Would a Black ,Assis-
tant AD under .\lyslinski have

much authority

“My aim here is to satisfy
the student,” he says. “That
means the teams have to be re-
spectable. And the only way to
be respectable is to win. I’m
not saying to win at any cost,
but to win as many games as
you can in the criteria of the
institution.

Cubs Back
After Five
Week Rest

.-\fter over a month of inaction
the freshman basketball team will
return to the court in a 6 p.m.
contest against the Youngstown
.JV‘s tonight in the first game
of the basketball double-header
at the Field House.

Sporting a 2-1 record. includ-
ing a December 8th victory over

~ the Duquesne freshmen. the Cubs

enter the game healthy but hun-
gry for some competition.

"It"ll take us some time to get
back.“ commented Coach Tim
Grgurich. but the boys have
been working out over the holi-
days and practicing with the
varsity every day. On the other
hand. a game is much different
than practice.“

Grgurich will go with his usual
starting line-up including Jim
Bolla, Mickey Martin, Sam Flem-
ming, Ken Wagoner and Bill
Swartzman. Both Bola and Flem-
ming have been ailing with knee
problems, and sixth man Gary
Pagano is having trouble with
his back, but none of these in-
juries, according to Grgurich,
are serious enough to sideline
the ballplayers.

Tonight the Cubs take on the
JV squad from Youngstown. I

saw Youngstown play against
the Duquesne lreslimen. anti
Duquesne won. They «Youngs-

town! got beat in the .-‘irena anti
that might not be a good indi-
cation of what they can do. They
are very big. "

The freshmen have a new ad-
dition to their squad in football
player Lance \\all. wall asked
if he could play for the team
and has been ‘doing a good job
in practice." according to Grgu-
rich. '

Track Team

Hosts KSU
Sat. /lft’n00n

by VINCE DiNARDO

Jim Banners track team will
participate in its only dual meet
of the indoor season on Saturday
as the host to the Golden Flashes
of Kent State at the Field House.
The Flaslies were the last team
to defeat the tracksters in a dual
meet two years ago.

Doug Raymond. Kent State
coach. isn‘t overly appreciative
of meeting Pitt and its ‘fine
array of talent.“

“I‘ll tell you one thing". ex-
plained ltaymond. “I'll expect
nothing but the best competition
from your team.“

The meet will be Kent State's
first of the indoor season and
this further dampened Raymond's
optomisim.

“t\ ell be better than last year“.
continued ltaymond ‘but it will
be our first meet. Besides. we
have inadequate indoor facilities
to trriin. and I don't expect us
to be sharp until later in the
year."

Banner. on the other hand.
doesnt agree with lx‘ay1nond.~:
analysis.

“They have a pretty good

sprinter and a couple of good
weight men", noticed Banner.
“They have agood m’iler—too."

Jill] BIICC Says ‘:%2%:‘:

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Senior gymnastic star Jim
Bilec is not a conventional run-of-
the—mill athlete.

‘Alien I was in high school
I wanted to be a wrestler. but
gymnastic practice started one
week before wrestling did. By
the time it came to make the de-
cision to go out for wrestling.
I realized I liked gyinnastics.”

Bilec established an impressive
record at west .\Iifflin .\orth
high school. three varsity let-
ters. two finishes in the top ten
of the district. and captain of
the team his senior year.

“I didn't want to come to
Pitt as a freshman because I
thought I’d have to live at home.
I really wanted to go to Penn
State, but Pitt gave me a better
offer so I came here.”

Also he stated that Pitt appeal-

ed to him more because of the

academic of the
school.
‘Pitt hasnt had a real good
team since Ive been here. I
couldnt get psyched for the
meets. But gradually the thrill

reputation

of competition built up.

Imagine, you’re all alone out
there. No one can cover for you.
If you make a mistake there is
no where to hide and everybody
sees it. It is just a one shot per-
formance.”

‘If the
find a solution. l‘ll listen to him-

Black assistant can

I might listen to him all the
time."
.\Iyslinski stresses that his

Black assistant must be someone
who will come to Pitt to do a
job.

Ballard also says the BAS
wants someone——whether he's call-
ed associate or assistant-——who can
get a job done for the Black
athlete.

That Hockey

Meeting Is

Todavl.
O’
Pitt student Joe 'l‘esta has had
some success in finding people

interested in organizing an ice
hockey team club at Pitt.

The group that has begun to
form is holding an organizational
meeting tonight for all faculty
ITi(.‘l'IIl‘it‘I‘.<. uIidei'gi‘a(liiiites. and
graduate students who are inter-
ested in joining.

The meeting will be held in

It seems that this attitude has
spilled over on the other team
members. Being the victims of
23 defeats to only seven victor-
ies in the past three years. fert-
ile ground was developed for this
attitude.

Last year Joel Alcoff was
the worst man on the team on
the sidehorse. But when he com-
peted. ever_v player on the team
wished him luck and cheered
for him. I even cheered harder
for Joel than Lowell «Meek».
Lowell always won and it would
have meant more to Joel to
score than it would to Lowell.“

"Winning teams like Spring-
field, whom we compete against
Saturday at Springfield, don’t
have the comarade like our
team has. They have such a fix-
ation about winning that they

 

Gymnasts’ Comradery Helps

won’t even talk to you before or
during the intermission of the
meet.”

I also think that we have
learned more about sports and
ourselves because of our record.
we are still proud and have dig-
nity in defeat which are the most
difficult characteristics a good
loser has to learn and maintain.
Maybe in defeat we have learn-
ed something which only defeat
can teach.“

Surprisingly the team is a very
cohesive unit. At practice there
are no major confrontations be-
tween players or the coach.

"We get along great as a bunch
of guys on and off the mat,”
Jim commented. “In fact six
of the team members room toge-
ther.”
