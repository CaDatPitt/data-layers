Plan Counter Libel Suits

By BOB THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Reporter

Members and alumni of Phi Kappa fraternity are fighting back
against charges of Hampton Hall residents W. Hayden Wilson and
Henry K. Kirkpatrick. Counter libel suits totaling more than half
a million dollars were to be filed this morning, according to
Robert A. Jarvis, attorney for the fraternity. A

Rally Pulls
Big Crowd

Three thousand students jammed
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall
yesterday to pay tribute to the
great Pitt team that swamped the
highly touted Northwestern Rose
Bowl champs.

The Dents from up on the hill
put teeth into the opening moments
of the unofficial rally by furnishing
some spirited cheering. Brandish-
ing large, over—sized molars and
canines, they formed the nucleus
of the cheering block.

Pandemonium really broke loose
when Captain Torn Hamilton strode
down the aisle. The entire student
body rose and rocked the auditorium
with cheers.

About the game Captain Tom
said, “You have won a terrific vic-
tory, you have a terrific team.” He
thanked the student body for its
support and asked its backing in
future games.

The cheering welled up again
when coach Mike Milligan appeared
on the stage. Milligan had nothing
but praise for his team. “We had a
great football game Saturday,” he
said, "The boys played magnifi-
cently. Every member of the squad
was responsible for the victory.”

Jimmy Joe Robinson gathered
some of the team and marched up
to the stage. As each player climb-
ed onto the stage he was welcomed
with thunderous cheering and ap-
plause.

A happy Dean Biddle said, “The
team was a defensive and offensive
atom bomb that devastated the
Northwestern team.”

Professor Ferguson of the'econ-
omics department dropped a bomb-
shell into the gathering when he
said, “On behalf of the faculty,
who should be here but are not,

who should be here but are not,
this will be my tribute to a great
Pitt team.”

Bimbo Cecconi, shy captain of
the Panthers put all the credit for
the victory on the excellent scout-
ing of coach Timmons. Bimbo said,

"All we had to do was listen to

 

hat Mr. Timmons said andwe won."

   

The suit and counter suit are
being heard in equity court. Pro-
ceedings were to start at 9:30 a.m.

Wilson and Kirk-Patrick had pre-
viously filed suit against the frat-
ernity to enjoin them from “permit-
ting petting, using offensive lan-
guage, holding initiations, and
playing loui radios.”

Charges Denied
The Phi Kappa reply denied un-

- conditionally all charges of the ac-

tion. Attorney Jarvis said, “I have
never seen a suit so scandalous
and ridiculous as the one which
has been filed.”

The libel suits, already totaling
over $300,000, were to be filed by
alumni, members, and the parents
of the Phi Kap men. Prominent
alumni were especially incensed.
In an affidavit state senator Joseph
M. Barr condemned the kind of suit
which had been directed against
Phi Kappa. Several unidentified
residents of Hampton Hall have vol-
unteered to testify for the fraternity.

Additional libel suits are already
being contemplated.

According to Jarvis, the frater-
nity would “meet the charges
‘head—on’ with no settlement con-
templated.” He said that the °irn-
mediate aim of the counter suit was

invited to the game.

Who would be that “someone,”
and who would stand the financial
cost, seems to be pretty much of a
mystery.

According to Silberstein, who
after having hatched the plan
“doesn’t have time” himself to
work on it, Andy Schurman is in
charge of it and has been working
on it ever since he was contacted
about a week ago.

Schurman, however, was very sur-
prised to hear that he was mention-
ed as being the biggest wheel. He
told the News that he was contacted
by Ben Grady of the athletic de-
partment and asked to line up a
force of 100 to make_the calls.

“But it was never mentioned,”‘
he said, “that I would be in com-
plete charge. Flora Diemert was to
line up typists to make the lists.”

Questions Unanswered

Miss Diemert, president of Stud-
ent‘ Congress, readily admitted her
responsibility. But certain difficult-
ies were cropping up. If 100 stud-
ents could be lined up, typists
would have to make lists of approxi-
mately 100 names long for each of
the dialers. B

All Miss Diemert wants to know
is "Who’s going to pay these typ-
ists?” No one, including Silber-
stein and the Athletic Department,
in whose name the calls presum-
ably would be made, has come up
with an answer yet.

For that matter there are quite a
lot of questions to answer yet.

Allowing each of the 100 three
minutes per call and considering
those calls which would have to be
remade because the recipient was
out, it would take each ‘member of
that force seven hours without a
break for coffee and donuts.

Schurman has been able to line
up 15 volunteers from Alpha Phi
Omega, national honorary Boy Scout
service fraternity, and expects to
get 15 more from the frats. He’s
still wondering where the other 70
are coming from.

Value Questioned
If 100 volunteers can be secured,
there is the actual cost of the phone
calls to be considered.It was plan-

advertised everywhere by yellow

The posters announcing the
"free” issue of the Panther (25¢)

Besides this year’s collaboration
with the Owl, the Panther’s busi-

Chest Upheld T
Pitt officials and the local chapter‘ of the American Red Cross
have reversed, apparently, the standard, though in this case,
shadowy, "chain of command” system. , _
U ; Itis fortunate these underlifrgs rebelled against the "brass,”
the national headquarters of the Red Cross,’ that they didn’t per-
mit then-head man Basil O’Connor to pull his rank on them. ,
i. _ It would have hurt at both ends, For, if national’s demand had:
been followed, it would certainly have removed a sizeable chunk
from the organization’s collectionsin Pittsburgh.
A dispute arose during the summer, as the national organiza-
tion attempted to crack clown on their branches in certain cities
‘where funds were being accepted from the receipts of joint drives,
that is,'a single solicitation from which several groups receive
shares. ‘
The,Pittsburgh chapter was one of these. Pitt’s three-sem-.
ester-old Chest drive, along with all-in-one campaigns in ‘several
{of the city’s‘largest industrial firms, became the focal points of
the argument._ . '
M This left A. K. Oliver, the Pittsburgh Red Cross head, with
<‘a~,decision to make. Should he follow ‘the directive from headquart-
;ers and face the probable loss of several thousand dollars in
" benefits? He knew that the joint drive system had been set up to
limit what had been seemingly endless canvasses by countless
. jdifferent charities.
' He also knew that, if he went along with the orders, Red
}Cross‘ would likely be dropped from among the participators in
the joint drives. The campaigns would continue in the same fash-
_ion and Red Cross would not be permitted as National wanted,
,to conduct drives of their own in the disputed places. _
_ .fr. Oliver made the sensible choice and resisted the order,
defied national’s ridiculous demand. National quietly dropped
the subject. . \ A ’
Obviously Mr. O'Connor and associates had seen that “beg-
*I—gars” shouldn’t be choosey. Which is exactly how they were act-
ling. They were asking for help, and at the same time refusing
help simply because they had to share it with other charities.
The records of the Pitt Chest drive show further the ludi-
crousness of lf~Tational’s stand. _ ~
if "Edwin ].il‘.lclntosh, assistant to the dean of men, who has
served in the records-keeping position since the Chest system
twas installed in the spring semester of 1947, says the books
show an increased contribution toeach organization, including
_ “the Red Cross, from the Chest campaigns of last year.

The Chest seems to have satisfiedall the requirements, even
those of the national Red Cross.
It takes the disgust out of a give-give-give hammering on the
student, removes the constant requests for drives from charities
'-:(a ‘carefully studied list of 98 worthy charities makes up the Chest
group with the receipts broken up according to value, need, and
i importance), and it supplies the askers with more than they could
, formerly expect from Pitt students.
A Mr. Mclntosh is now getting ready, along with Bob Peary and
Jim Morton, Student-Congress-appointed Chest -drive heads, for
the fall semester Chest campaign. '

Presumably, it will receive the student support it has the
past two semesters and satisfy all concerned. \

One-Sided on Dinks?

.<Editor,
Pitt News

Far be it from me to object to the
Pitt News writing anything it
chooses, but I do disapprove of its
traveling under false colors. The
editorial policy of last ,Tues’.iay’s
News on freshman dinks was not
“split right down the middle,” as
claimed. From where I sat, it was
definitely loa'ded.

Page l started it off with a two-
column print of a morose frosh
dejectedly looking down at a dink.
Next came the cartoon, needling the
whole situation. And, finally, the
one-sided editorial debate, with
the whole affirmative case merely
paraphrasing, “Now that you’re
stuck with the dink, Freshie, you
might as well get to like it.”

Contrary to, What the News
implies, I sincerely believe that
the average freshman doesn’t object
to the dink. This Class of ’53 has
shown more school spirit ‘than any
of their prototypes in recent his-
tory. For proof of this, you don’t
have to go any further than the huge
response toFres'nman Camp and the
first Freshman Mixer Social.

The News could well take a tip
from ODK. This top honorary voted
against dinks, when approached by
?.len’s Council_on the question. Its
members agreed, however, that if
the measure should be passed, they
would give it their full support. I
don’t think I have to point out the
advantage of this over the subtle
negative attitude advocated by the
News.

Pitt’s ‘cap’ problems are really
coming to a head. Two years ago
we had a ROTC cap problem when
they threw away the blues and went
Army style. Last week we hadthe
freshman cap problem. Now,.thanks
to some_ of our bluenosed Oakland
neighbors, we have a Phi Kap prob-
lem.

At this minute, (unless YOU are
\reading this over your lunch) a
number of red-blooded young Amer
icans are defending their inalien-
able rights in a court action
brought by the Messrs. W. Hayden

Wilson and Henry J. Kirk-Patrick
residents of one Hampton Hall, an
Oakland apartment house.

It seems that the two gentlemen
have been annoyed by some of_ the
activities of a group of college
men banded together under the roof

nity, whose house immediately ad-
joining said Hampton Hall.

They wa-nt the Phi Kaps to quit
petting in cars parked behind their
house, quit playing radios loudly,
stop holding initiations, stop using
the Phi Kap ‘.‘driveway” for park-
ing, stop using a parking lot auth-
orized for their (the Phi Kaps)
private use by the city, and elimi-
nate the use of offensive language.

All but the parking practices
have been included in an injunc-
tion sought against the fratmen.
The Hampton Hall residents com-

The first week of \school might
be appropriately named "Groan
Week.” There was a lot to groan

about. For instance, take the ex-
tensive excavations surrounding

-the Cathedral like a medieval moat.

All summer the cobblestones of
Forbes and Fifth lay virgin in the
sun. Strange that as soon as there
are 15,000 more people to walk on
them and 3000 more cars to park,
the DPW moves in with their ravag-
ing bulldozers.

The parking problem has been so
aggravated by the repairs that in
order to park within" seeing distance
of Pitt, a student must come before
7 a.m. Local boys-in—b1ue are not
sympathetic to the driving student’s
problem. It is rumored that a local
bookstore will make an" offer soon
to bind parking tickets into scratch
pads for a small fee. l

Again we come to that insult to
the "brew that cheers but not in-
ebLi_ates,” Tuck Shop coffee. If the
prohibitive price was the only bone
of contention, the whole issue might
easily be -overlooked. lloweverlthe
8-cent cups of coffee taste like
they've been stirred with a dirty
mop by Macbeth’s three witches.

Of course there’s a tale that ye
extra three cents covers the added
cost of buying blue and gold coffee
beans with a block “P” etched on

their surface. _

International alphabet soup is a Pitt speciality for all acti-
vated students -- provided they don't twist their tongues tasting

the letters."

Strictly cosmopolitan, the Pitt special contains the Greek as

well as the American alphabets.

Some of the ingredients are:
YMCA, WAA, ODK, and WSGA, to
say nothing of PiKA, which might
be a variation of Shoe Fly Pie.

With a little concentration and
dehydration, this activated brew
can be boiled down to mean acti-
vities on campus.

Broken down YWCA is the
Young Women’s Christian Associa-
tion. This orga ization is open to
all upperclass women who are
interested in promoting Christian
living on campus. '

Before 1920 WAA stood for
Women’s, Activities Association,
the regulating body of the women
students. Since then the letters
have been taken over by the
Women’s Athletic Association

which plans sports programs for
undergraduate women. '

need for the parking lot. As a mat-
ter of fact, the apartment dwellers
have often asked and received
permission to park their own cars
on Phi Kap property.

The whole teapot-tempest boils
down to the conclusionthat the two
gentlemen in question, annoyed by
the carefree glee of their youthful
neighbors, figured if they slung
enough mud, some of it would stick.
They dug pretty low for their grade
of mud. .
. Or perhaps Mr. Kirk-Patrick, an
instructor at Carnegie Tech, nurses
a grudge over the fact that Pitt and
the vocational school are no longer
gridiron equals. Or maybe both men
are frustrated Phi Kap pledges, re-
fused membership in their youth by
the original Phi Kap chapter. Phi
Kappa was founded at Brown Uni-
versity in 1889. ‘

Rumor has it that the complain-
ants are allergic to maroon and
couldn’t stand the sight of the
gaudy Phi Kap jackets worn by the
North Dithridge Street Greeks.

Still another source reported that
they dislike football players, dan-
cers, and state senators. Dick

You have to give the Hampton
Holl-erers credit for shrewdness,
however. Although they complained
to the Dean of Men about initiation
disturbanceslast spring, they bided
their time all summer when hardly
a soul went near the frat house,
then jumped in the moment the stu-
dents returned in the fall, before
the ‘fraternity had time to hold any
affairs. i

That sounds more illogical than
shrewd, but the canny Scot"and his
buddy knew enough about fraterni-
ties to realize that, with frat rush-
ing only a few weeksgoff, a suit
such as they had connived would
blackenthe Phi Kaps’ reputation
enough to scare off any freshman

the case might be decided. ‘

Food Service Grapples
With Digestive Duties

By SHIRLEY LEVINE
Pitt News Staff Reporter
Feeding 12,000 students, walking eight to ten miles a day,
figuring a ten-day menu, and supervising 175 employees is all
part of_a day's work for Ruth Cramblet and Savina Skewis, who
head the University Food Service.
The scope of the Food Service includes the care and servicing
of the Ellsworth Center Tuck Shop, the University Tuck Shops,

and the cafeteria. In addition,
.‘\lisses Cramblet and Skewis also
plan the food for such events as
band camp, choir camp, freshmen
camp, teas, and special dinners.

2,000 Sandwiches Daily

Miss Cramblet estimates that Pitt
students eat approximately 2000
sandwiches and 200 pies per day in
addition to hundreds of regular 55
cent and 75 cent hot meals in the
cafeteria.

While most students are familiar
with the Tuck Shops and‘Caféteria,
few could visualize what goes into
the making of a ham sandwich.

The layout of the sub-basement,
though perhaps not as beautiful, is
as efficient and clean as any large
Pittsburgh restauratn. The cafeteria
itself came into being during the
war when 2500 GI’s were fed three
times a day.

Adjoining Workrooms

Adjoining the cafeteria, are the
various workroorns such as the dish
room, loading room, cold room for
vegetables and meats, egg room,
and stock room.

Largest of these rooms is the
kitchen where great soup cauldrons
are always in use, and where the

.0vens bake 48 pies at a .time. Add

to this the Tuck Shop preparation
rooms, and it totals up to work.

In back of all this preparation
stand the 175 employees who are
as loyal to Pitt as any undergrad-
uate. Reason for their deep rooted
loyalty reflects on their “bosses”
Miss Cramblet and Miss Skewis.

Overtime Common

When asked _if they liked working
at the University, the typical ans-
wer is “Like it? You bet I like it!”
Though they sometimes have to
work overtime they never complain.
In fact at the “Smorgasbord” after
working until 11:30 p.m. they were
still reluctant to go home.

Misses Cramblet and Skewis, who
claim that they are “too busy to
attend their own funeral” know
each of their employees personally.
They not only know their names,
but they know their problems.

Entertainment Given
Last year between semesters the
two women turned the Red Tuck
Shop linto an employee workshop
of

 

tour of the University, various les-
sons, and an informal chat with
Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald. On(
the last day, tables were turned as
the employees put on a special pro-
gram for the "bosses.”

Misses Cramblet and Skewis ex-
ercise their belief “You get joy in
helping other people succeed."
They are primarily concerned with
“making Pitt pleasant for the stud-
ent.”

Although heading the'University
Food Service is a 12 to 15 hour a
day job, it is evident that both
Misses Cramblet and Skewis love
their work. However, it is their
sincere hope that if there are any
complaints or suggestions, the
students will not hesitate to voice
them.

As Miss Cramblet said, “After
all, we can’t taste all 200 pies.”

IF Reception
Slated Oct. 7

Freshmen this year will have an
early opportunity to learn about
fraternity life. All they have to do
is ask the man who belongs to one.

Their chance to do. this will
come at the IF Reception for fresh-
men, Oct. 7, at 7:30 in Foster
Memorial.

Although 1000 invitations have
been mailed, Farl Jacob, reception
chairman, “regrets that some late
transfer students may have been
missed."

To these men and all other frosh,
Jacob extends an invitation to
attend the reception.

lleagling the program is Theodore
W. Biddle, dean of men, who will
address the group. Lester G.
Brailey, frat advisor, will also
speak. The entertainment includes
a magician and an un-announced
speaker.

After the program a reception
for the guests will be held by the
fraternities. Fraternity attendance
is limited to six brothers from each
group.

Ray Maher,president of IF, made
it clear that "This meeting must
not be considered a rushing event.
There will be a lot of potential
frat men and we can meet them in
small, convenient groups.”

In Shakespeare's time the

play was the thing but today at

Pitt the Players are the up and coming thing.

The Pitt Players, the oldest

amateur theatrical group in Pitts-

burgh, have an impressive history. Although drama at the Uni-

versity dates back to the Thespian Corps of 1807, the present ,1

group began with World War I. In
those early days life was grimmer
because the actors had to climb
"The Hill” for rehearsals at Trees
Gym.

During the 1922-27 period the
Players performed in the old Heinz
House on a movable stage built by
the technical crews. In 1027 the
Players gave their first off-campus
production.

The spring of 1946 marked an
important event in the dramatists’
more recent history. They produced,
for the first time off Broadway,
Maxwell Anderson’s "Joan of Lor-
raine.”

This, the 32nd season'for the
Players, is likewise important. A
formal reception will be held in the
Stephen Foster Social Room on the
opening night of “Arsenic and Old
Lace,” the first production to give
the public a chance to meet the
Players. The third play, Shakes-
peare's “J ulius Caesar,” will go
on a week’s tour. As a grand finale
for the season the Players will pre-
sent a Broadway musical to be
chosen by the University student
body.

The curtain is going up \on
another big year for the Dirt
Players.

 

TEN ‘BIG’ DANCFS are on the
student calendar this year.

Mrkonic, Democratic candidate for’
constable in the comingMcKeesport
election, was doomed by political

A fortune tellers but won the nom-

ination without party support by
canvassing homes.

Boy Politico
Seeks Office

By LEN BAKER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt may soon include a McKees-
port constable on its roster if Emil
Mrkonic is as successful in the
November elections as he was in
the Democratic primaries.

Mrkonic, who is 22 years old and
a junior in the College, was not
conceded much of a chance against
the incumbent. candidate by tenth
ward political fortune tellers.

Without the backing of a strong
political machine, he canvassed
McKeesportv homes «explaining his
education in Pitt’s political sci-
ence department and his plans for
the future.
His nomination in the primaries
testifies to lis convincing manner.
The "boy politician,” as he is
known around McKeesport political
icracker barrels, has "shrewd an-
gles” planned for his campaign
which would make him the youngest
elected politician in the county
after the November elections.
His running mate, Albert Elko,
who is seeking the position of al-
derman, graduated from Pitt last
June. Their campaign slogan is
“The shrewdest man will win.”
Lmfkonic claims that the credit
for his. nomination belongs to his
teachers who gave him many of his
ideas. Majoring in political sci-
ence, he is looking towards law
school. He is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma, the freshman honorary frat-
ernity, and the varsity marching
band.
During his campaign his youth
was often against him but his
looks only hampered him once. At
one house where he knocked the
door was answered by a spindled-
legged girl. She carried his card to
her father and whispered loud
enough for Mrkonic to hear, "Is he
handsome!”

To which her father replied,
"Handsome. Then, the hell with
him!”

A new course in management for

Pitt was selected to teach this
course, the only one of its kind in

of college facilities by the Air

managementproblems for executives

February.

Organized with the aid of a team
of five Air Force officers, the
course now enrolls 34 officers.

U set Rally

(Cont. from Page 1)

Much credit for the success of
the rally should go to the excellent
Pitt marching band. They brought
‘the students to their feet cheering
with their jazz treatment of “South
Rampart Street Rag.”

Concerning the rally, Dean Biddle
representing the administration,

felt that Student Congress should
hold back until they could deter-
mine student sentiment regarding
it. However,Captain Tom Hamilton
admonished Congress with, ‘ ‘You're
going to feel the student pulse?
Youought to be the student pulse.”

Commenting on the rally, Captain
Hamilton thought that it was very
successful.

ed the returning Panthers at the

Make Debut
On Friday

By SAM SPATTER

Coach Carl Olson staged a
tryout last Friday at Schenley
Park among 20 candidates vying
for starting roles on Pitt’s cross
country squad, which opens the
season here Friday against Slip-
pery Rock.

The Panthers dropped their
lone meet last season in the
opener against Slippery Rock,
but later defeated them in the
Senior AMA-AAU meet in Schen-
ley Park.

Moore Only Loss

Loss of starter John Moore
has left the ‘varsity virtuallyin-
tact from 1948 but a host of
sophomores have been pressing
the veterans for starting roles.
Newcomers Ed Berman, Frank
Kuzma, John Kountz, Jack Mc-
Mahon, and Ken Mahanna are
given the best chances by Coach

“Olson of breaking into the regular

lineup.

“Frank Kuzma,”Olson beam-
ed, “seems a sure fire shot to
oust one of the regulars. But
Berman, McMahon and Mahanna
are also pressing hard. John
Kountz has also shown consider-
able improvement.”

Six Holdovers

Top. point getters Jay Neil-
son and Ted Zatkovich are ex-
pected to retain their regular
status.‘ Other varsity men who
will have a definite say as to
the starting lineup will be hold-
overs Richard Hohan, Blair
Thomas, John Weigel, and John
Wilson.

Freshmen interested in trying
out for the frosh squad are wel-
comed by Olson. Pitt garnered
two of the district’s better high
school harriers in Bernard Luter-
anick of Mt. Lebanon and Bob
Pastorious of Carrick.

uled for the varsity this fallwith

A IIALLO DON :lERE-<-Big John Huzvar, 6 foot 4 inch freshman full-

back post. Huzvar is being looked to for big things in the future.

Giant Fullback Brightens
Pitt’s Gridiron Future

. B)’ STANLEY SKIRBOLL
Pitt News Sports Writer

Did you ever see a coach’s dream walking? If you haven’t then drop

over at Ellsworth Field some time and take a look at a possibility.
Take a look at a 6 foot 41/; inch, 237 pound fullback who may make
Mike Milligan pinch himself next year to prove that he isn’t dreaming.

John lluzvar, 20-year old trans-
fer student from
State,» hopes to become the Pitt
‘dream that will bring nightmares to
the opposition.

He not only runs-—in fact he does
the hundred in ten flat--but passes
too, with either hand you prefer.

With such quality points as this,

- it is only natural that Huzvar be-

came one of the most sought-after
football players in the country. He
has had offers from over a 100
‘schools, including every school in
the ‘Big Ten, Notre Dame, Penn
State, California, UCLA, Texas,
and practically any other place
where a pigskin is evident.

It may take an NCAA ruling to
determine his number of eligible
varsity years, although Huzvar
played freshman ball during the
war when tne NCAA relaxed its pro-
visions. The catch is the fact that
he is a transfer student, and must
therefore sit this year out. How-
ever, he is working out daily with
the Pitt frosh to keep in shape.

lluzvar comes from Hershey, Pa.
He was a starting regular for four
years on his high school team, and
led them to the Southern Pennsyl-
vania Conference championship for
three straight years.

In his senior year, Huzvar was
selected as the outstanding high
school football player in the nation
and was presented with a trophy by
Tom Hamilton, then with Navy.

After a ear as fullback for the
Tarheels, lohn quit and joined the
Marines. ‘I left,’ he explained, ‘be-
cause at State there is only one

thing-—fo’otball, and I'm coming to '1

school, believe it or not, to get an
education.’ _ _

SWIMMERS CALLED

 

“Bowl Busters"

Big Reputations Battered

By Surprising Panthers

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Pitt News Sports Editor
EVANSTON, Ill.-—You’ll pardon Pitt’s Panthers if they don't
have much respect for the post-season bowl business or the All-

America selections.

The Panthers have already trimmed William & Mary’s Deltaiiii

Bowl champs, 13-7, and Northwes-
tern’s Rose Bowl champs, 16-7,
and it seems likely rhat they will
give a similar treatrrent this Sat-
urday to West Virginia's Sun Bowl
winners.

As forAll-Americans, the Pitts
have slammed down Indian Jack
Cloud and Wildcat Art Murakowski
with no two ways about it.

Rude Party Manners

The Sun Bowl boys down Morgan-
town way will be bottom-heavy un-
derdogs against Pitt. When North-
western Coach Bob Voigts invited
the Panthers to T, the guests rud-
ely spilled the stuff all over the
field. Barring overconfidence, a
similar invitation from West Vir-
ginia's Dud DeGroot should find
the Panthers with their manners
even worse.

DeGroot’s club has thus far
flopped. It polished off little Way-
nesburg, lost to Ohio U., and squ-
eezed by Washington and Lee.

Moreover, the longjawed coach's
backfield,‘led by passing Jim Walt-
hall and Fullback Pete Zinaich,
cannot be as tough as Northwest-
ern’s Murakowski, Ed Tunnicliff,
John Miller, and Don Burson. And
Pitt held the latter crew to a net
of 66 yards rushing.

Pitt Now Deep

The Panthers, moreover, are now
working under the knowledge that
they possess depth, although it is
true that first-stringers did all of
Pitt’s scoring in Dyche Stadium.

It was Bimbo Cecconi who hea-
ved a 22-yard pass to Jimmy Joe
Robinson in the first period for a
TD. And it was Nick Bolkovac who
converted and then kicked a 15-
‘yard field goal with 25 seconds
remaining until halftime. And it
was Robinson again who scored on
a 12-yard jaunt aroiind end in the
final quarter.

But sophomores, second-string
ers, and even confirmed bench war-
mers frequently helped set up the

scores-—-and limit Northwestern to 

One TD;

With less than a minute remain-_‘ J.
ing, Miller turned the Panther left 
end for 11 yards and a ‘tally, but to 9
all intents and purposes the three-

deep Pitt squad had already knock-
ed off another;bowl winner.

INCIDENTALS: Bobby Timmons,
Pitt’s end coach, must have done

an alert job of scouting the Wild- 7

cats...The Panther defense seem-

ed perfectly geared to NU’s of-5

fense...Defensive halfbacks were,

stationed almostias far forward as,
the line-backers, thus foiling Nor-'

thwestern’s ground game, which is
its big weapon...Bimbo Cecconi

might have gone the distance with:
the opening kickoff...There were“
two Wildcats in front of him 
when he was stopped at about the .:

 About Pitt’s

' ticularly care for your presence?

I can testify that it is not a com-
fortable position to be in, for I
came to this place under just those
circumstances. Here is why I was
not the most loved one in the com-
pany:

Three days before the trip there
appeared in this space an article
'stating, in general, that Mike Mil-
ligan may not have to beat as much
pain as some of the nation’s other
coaches when he parts with the
last of the GI football crop next
year.

After all, Mike has gotten some
pretty good football from such non-
vets as Nick Bolkovac, Carl De-
Pasqua, and Bimbo Cecconi, to
mention only a few. At some

M schools the outstanding performers
‘were almost solely GI’s.

, A WRONG _ IMPRESSION

Apparently Pitt's GI players got

the impression that a pat on the

. back to the mn-vets amounted to a

dig at the vets. Not at all. On the

contrary, Pitt’s ex-servicemen have

‘ been both as good and as bad as

any other group of football players,

mill workers, white collar men, or
what have you.

Moreover, the disputed piece
criticized a collegiate coach (not
A a local one) who had called the
vets "WPA” ball players. This
coach, it ,_was pointed out, was
overlooking the fact that the vets
‘ are more mature and therefore smar-
ter, by and large, than the non-vets.
' -Now this explanation is not a
, tool of appeasement. It is not vi-
tally important that I be either the
darling or arch enemy of Pitt foot-
ball players. But it is important
that the facts be set straight.

SHORT PUNTS

Saturday morning several hours
before the Northwestern game, a
sparrow somehow got into the lobby
of the Sovereign Hotel where the
Panthers were staying. The bird
was whizzing around furiously
overieverybody’s heads, evidently
havinga fine time. “Let him alone,
that's good luck,” an elderly wo-
-man called to the party. No one
bothered the feathered friend’, and,
ofi course, you know what happen-

AND FUMBLES

The Rubbing-It-In-Department:.
Fullback Jim Campbell, entangled
in a pileup with Wildcat Center
Chuck Petter, inquired, "You
playing in the Rose Bowl, big
boy?” Reply is unprintable...Pitt’s
charging ;was superb but hardly e-
qual to the rush to the plane for‘
seats by the windows.

After dinner music was provided
in the hotel lobby Friday evening
by Jose Masarik and Artur Warri-
ner...The aforementioned Jim Camp-
bell turned sage during the trip
back to Pittsburgh. “I’ll bet the
trip home from Dyche Stadium was
longer for those Northwestern guys
than it is for us,” he observed.

After a four month
layoff from spring training the
thirty-five man squad began final
preparations for their lid-lifter on
Saturday, against Memphis Naval
Air Station.

Line Big

Coach Paul Sager flashed an

optomistic smile as he witnessed

his squad rounding into shape last A

week. His line is big and fast.
From end to end the average weight
is 219 pounds. Some of the early
standouts are John McCaskey, a
250 pounder from East Deer, and
Bob Moser, a husky guard from
T3rownsville.

Backing up this burly Panther
line is a light but shifty group of
backs. The average weight of this
promising lot is 185. Some of the
standouts here are Robby Jones, a
fullback from Wierton, West Virginia,
'3ob Feskp, a seat back, and Bill
Ewing, the probable number one
quarterback.

Two Aides

In preparation for the season,
Sager has enlisted the aid of Jack
Smodic as assistant backfield
coach, and Tony Razanno, who has
accepted the task of forming the

young Panther line.

Most of the present squad played
jayvee or freshman ball last year.

For First Annual

31168

The Engineering and Mines Association serves notice that it
will bring back Benny Benack and his "Collegians” to Pitt for
the Association’s annual dance OX1. Nov. 11.

Although this will be the first appearance of the Benack band
at a University function, Benack himself is firmly entrenched on
campus as assistant director of the Varsity Marching Band.

This dance will highlight a
semester’s activities of the F.8;M
which includes a smoker for all
members on Dec. 2.

Newly-elected president of F.&'M,
Nick Laux, has asked that all pro-
spective members of the group pur-
chase their membership cards as
soon as possible. They are avail-
able at $2.50 at the Student Desk‘
and from all members of the F.8.'l‘.i
cabinet.

Represents 2000 Students

l‘I8.'M represents some 2000 engi-
neering and mines students from
State and Thaw Halls. With approxi-
mately 50O members, the }€&l\l is
one of the largest organizations
on the Pitt campus.

The group has pioneered the
selection of an outstanding senior
from the represented schools. lie
will be selected by a vote of the
students to be presented with a
plaque recognizing his abilities.
Voters will base selection on
general all-round scholarship and
character.

The decrepit 1916 jalopy, brake-
less and clutchless, that E8-(M
coaxed -around the stadium oval
dur_ing the football games last fall
will soon put in its appearance
again.

The relic which was raffled off
as a door prize for an E&l\l dance
has been purchased back from the
lucky winner, civil engineer Doug
Wright. It is slated to be the
vehicle for such advertising as the

Club Plots

Full Year

Th_e Newman Club, in its first
meeting of the new semester on

Sept. 28 at Cathedral High School,
organized old business, planned
dances for the fall semester, and
appointed George Hughes chairman
of the constitution revision com-
mittee.

Hughes will be responsible for
revision of the new constitution to
include the election of officers. The
revision will be necessary because
of the formation of a new and inde-
pendent chapter of the club at Pitt.

Activities planned by the club
will be open to members from all
five of the local colleges. The ac-
tivities will consist of two semi-
formals, two communion breakfasts
with prominent guest speakers, and
a Day of Recollection. ’

Father F. Ford, new chaplain for

 ‘the Pitt Newman Club, said that he

intends to encourage more campus
activities. Bill Griffin, chairman of
the athletics committee, is taking
applications from men who want to
try for the Newman Club entry in the
touch football intramurals.

Don Riley, chairman of the mem-
bership committee,plans to concen-
trate his recruitingpdrive on the
freshmen, expecially the women
students. The committee hopes to
achieve a more equal balancein the
:ratio of men to women members.

Membership in the Newman Club
is open to any Catholic student
of the University. The aim of the
club, according to its charter, is to
give its members a "balanced pro-
gram of religious, intellectual, and
social activities.”

If you had been born 85,000 years ago and
were still alive, think of all you would
know about what happened on earth.
A.nd if you had devoted all those years
to working with one particular material
found on earth -. . . say aluminum . . . think
what you would know about that.
Actually, man has known of aluminum
for less than 150 years and didn’t really
start to use it commercially until 1888
when Alcoa started producing it. Yet in
Alcoa’s employ today is a group of men
and women who possess a total of 85,000
years of aluminum working knowledge.
These people, 2,900 of them, proudly
wear this button as members of the Alcoa

25-Year Service Club. Many have been in i

the family longer than 25 years. Their
jobs range all the way from mill hand to
president, .from engineer to chairman of
the board. They are a fourth of all the
employees Alcoa had 25 years ago, pretty

FIRST IN ALUMINUM A,

good indication that it’s “a good company
to work for”.

But here’s the most signiﬁcant point:
Sixty-one years ago, when Alcoa started,
only ﬁve men were employed. Today
about a million people have jobs in the
aluminum. industry, an industry com-
prised of: companies who produce alumi-
num from ore; companies who smelt
aluminum scrap; others who make semi-
ﬁnished aluminum products; and hundreds
of companies who manufacture useful

articles in which aluminum plays an"

essential part. _ _
Today the same pioneering spirit that
marked the founding of this industry is
evident in Alcoa’s laboratories, mills and
foundries. Here men are developing new
uses, new techni ties that promise even
more for the iluture of aluminum.

Parking Lot Center of Row

The parking lot controversy
seems to be the main bone of con-
tention at present.

Jarvis intends to base part of his
action on the fact that at the time
Phi Kappa applied for permission
from the City of Pittsburgh to cut
the curb in front ofiits house , the
Hampton Hall management author-
ized its attorney to appear on be-

half of the fraternity.
he cutting down of the curb

paved the way for the drive which
was run betveen the apartment
building and the fraternity house to
the Phi Kap-owned lot in the rear.

4.

According to Jarvis there is no
ordinance that prohibits parking un-
der the circumstances of the case.
He added that“the parking lot does
not apply under zoning laws. The
members of the fraternity have a
constitutional right to park their
cars on their own property.”

Property in the vicinity of the
Phi Kap house is placed in Zone C
which expressly permits clubs and
organizations such as a fraternity.

Jarvis contends that "because
of this zoning rating residents of
the district can well expect a dif-
ferent sort of atmosphere than that
which prevails in the zones rated
‘residential.’ ”He also stated that
“since neither Wilson nor Kirk-Pat-
rick areproperty owners, but merely
tenants on neighboring property,
their right to file such a suit is

lessened.” _ A
Jarvis is president of the Phi

Kappa Alumni Foiridation, a non-
profit organization which owns the
fraternity house. It is held in trust
in the name of Mrs. Camille Mac-
Elwee, house mother for the men.
As chief counsel for the defense
Jarvis will have an array of 12 law-
yers backing him in his action. In-

many Pitt students live in toll

“The value of the plan,” says

Silberstein, “is to inform the stud-
ents that the team verily needs
their support.”

The popular belief among student
circles is that students don’t Show
up at the Stadium to cheer the Pan-
thers on, but to see Pitt battle it
out with big name schools.

When the people who decide
these things, whoever they may be,

A long-awaited dream of Pitt
students, both past and present,
seems about to materialize.

Plans for the proposed Student
Center, which is to be located on
the Cathedral campus, are ready
to come out of the blueprint stage.

In conjunction with this, top stu-
dent leaders will meet with the ad-
ministration to discuss plans for
the proposed Student Center.

These groups will meet at an in-
formal dinner to be held at the
Twentieth Century Club on Wed-
nesday, Oct. 5 at 3:30 p.. . Plans
for the spacing and housing of the
different student activity groups
will be discussed.

The Student Center was planned
originally to co-ordinate student
activities, and to alleviate the
crowded classroom and library situ-
ation in the Cathedral. ‘

When completed, the Student Cen-
