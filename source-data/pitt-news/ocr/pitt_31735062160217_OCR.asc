Pledge Periods Less Severe
As “Hell” Changes to “Help”

By IRENE ROZAKIS
. “More work than Hell” is one TTKA’s description of
the trend toward a more constructive and less destructive

pledging period at Pitt.

In recent years, frats have
gradually abandoned hazing, at
least in its extreme forms, in
favor of a work period for
pledges.
rDelta Tau Delta fraternity sent

some of its pledges to the School
for the Blind this week to cata-
logue records, according to Leo
Kairys, frat president.

Started in 1940

The Delts started having “Help
Week” instead of “Hell Week” in
1940, abandoning hazing, tiring
walks, and games. ,

Under the new system, pledges
work at school, at the Chancel-
lor’s or.Deans’ homes, or at their
own fraternity house. They are
also required to go to church Sun-
day morning.

The Sigma Chi’s work under a
similar ‘plan, and intend to have
their pledges work at school of-
ficials’ ‘ homes.

Improve Frat Houses

Most of the frats claim that they
never have had a really severe
“Hell Week.” Gene Rock, Theta
Chi president, said, “We have a
work week instead, with both ac-

' tives and pledges pitching in to

improve the fraternity house."

Another Theta Chi, Jay Jacob-
son, remarked, “Hell Week” in
most cases went out with the
1920’s.”

A trip to neighboring chapters
used" to be’ required of Lambda
Chi pledges, according to one

«spokesman, but this idea, as well

as any others -connected with Hell
Week, has been given up. At
least one Lambda Chi is sorry

. about this, however, noting that

‘it gave the pledges a chance to

nounced that the OWL will
terminate its obligation to its

E & M Junior
Gets Award

The Ben J. Lubic Memorial
Award was presented today to
Lesteh A. Yeaney, a junior in the
School of Engineering.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
made the presentation in his of-
ﬁce. \

The award, which this year
amounted to $200, is given each
year to a junior man or woman
who “shows the characteristics of
good citizenship, and shows good
potentialities.” The money is to be
applied to next year’s tuition.

The fund for the award was set
up four years ago by the wife of
Ben J. Lubic, an alumnus of the
University and a former basket-
ball player here. In the past the
awards have averaged about $1.65.

New Mortar Board
Officers Elected.

On Saturday evening in the
Commons Room the Spring tappees

secretary; Jessie Goode, treasurer;
and Marilyn Denton, editor.

Past Two Semesters

For the past two semesters this
group has busied itself in im-
proving its house and grounds.
Alpha Phi Alpha admitted that
it used to indulge in Hell Week,
but is seriously considering switch-
ing to a type of Help Week.

A Phi Gam spokesman pointed
out that his fraternity changed
its policy because it involved “a
lot of nonsensical stuff that didn’t
beneﬁt anyone.”

President Joe Connor, of the
Phi Kaps, said that his frat is
considering turning to Help Week
in the Spring semester pledging
period.. Usually, he said, there
isn’t as much work to do around
the house in the Spring as there
is in the fall.

Hired Pledges Out

The Sigma Alpha Mu’s innovat-
ed a new idea this year when they
hired their pledges out to anyone
who would contribute $50 or more
to the March of Dimes Fund, and
also sponsored a party for an or-
phan’s home.

According to Joseph Manker,
Jr., IF president at Duquesne, the
trend toward Help Week is evi-
dent there, also, while reports
from Carnegie Tech indicate that
they, too, would rather have a
week of “Help” than a week of
“Hell”.

Pitt Evaluation
Sought by Poll

By HAROLD LEVINE

In this year’s ﬁnal issue of
the Panther six graduating
seniors who had been student
leaders during‘ their stay here
gavel conﬂicting answers to
the question, “Would you send
your children to Pitt?” The Pitt
News asked the same question to
a group ‘of average students,

Goldie Mallmger, College ’55,
“..Yes, because of the wide range of
ages and personalities found at
Pitt, a student can get a better
rounded education here.

Elmer Powell, Bus Ad, night
school, “No, Pitt is too big. It
doesn’t have the atmosphere of a
It is all right for night
school, but not for full time.”

Jerry Rhoades, Engineering, ‘S4,
‘3Yes, Pitt offers opportunities for
a wider range of experience than a
campus college. The moral atmos-
phere of a city university is better
too.” '

Don Gerbig, Engineering, ’55,
“Yes, if he could live near the
campus. I don’t like commuting.”

-James Harper, Graduate School,
Slippery Rock ’49, “No Pitt is too
much like a factory. There is no
social life.”

Walt Fink, Engineering, ’55, “It
all ‘depends on whether I could af-
ford to send them out of the city.
I would prefer going away to
school.”

Hugh Harkins, College ’55, “Yes,
I would send my children here if I
lived near here and it was conven-
ient. Pitt is as good as any school
to get an education. It is not so
much the school as the person him-
self.”

Georgia Starthis, Education '52,
“Yes, I have spent four happy
years here.” .

Mrs. Mary Levendis, Education,
’52, “No, I would rather send him
to Alcatraz. Educational standards
are high here, but as far as a feel-
ing of unity is concerned, there
isn’t any. ‘

Harvy Zehnder, College, ’53,
“Yes, I feel that there will be quite
a few improvements in the school
by the time I have a child old
enough to go to college.

 The Board’: Job

The publications board’s decision to put a Panther back

don the campus was a wise one, but the real test of their
wisdom will come when the editorial staff of the new mag

takes over and goes into production on next year’s issues.

The report which Prof.

Graham’s committee read to

 the board, and which was subsequently approved, could
easily intimidate the editors, whose administration, if things.

go according to plan, will be installed before school’s out.
'There are some tough phrases in that report; phrases which

i .make it all too “obvious that the board has a life and death

power over the Panther’ organization. The result could
easily be a magazine sterile, valueless, and readerlessx

_ So it will be up to the board now, provided it is sin-
cere in wanting a creditable Panther, to do all it can to
convince the editors that they do have considerable free-
dom, to encourage them to reach for their limits rather

,- than shun them and invite them to put all their talents and
» initiative to work to make the new Panther a readable en-

tertaining and worthwhile magazine.

Fare Thee Well.” '52

The Class of ’52 is now ripe-

for the season of the handshake
and the truism.

By careful stages they have
come to feel properly (and sur-

K . Drisingly) nostalgic about de-

before they let our grads out of
the sun, th/ey’l1 ﬁnd’ an opportu-
nity to point the long index ﬁn-
ger "of responsibility at the Class
of ’52 and say, “You are the ones
who must lead . . .” ‘
Not a single senior has a soul
so practical that he will not be

. . moved by these people, who take

advantage of his new nostalgia
for long-dead beer parties and
fraternity hell nights. The com-
mencement—-warmly, pleasantly
artiﬁcial and very effective—will
ﬁll every senior with an excess
of hope that he will make the old
place proud of him yet.

The Class of ’52 may be intro-
spective‘ enough to ask itself
what it got out of college. It
probably got no great amount of
knowledge or even of opinions.
If it was lucky and deserving, it
did get, at best, an inkling of the

The Class of ’52 probably did its
job well here, if it acquired the
ability to-—in a word——appIieci-
ate.

Some seniors got more than
that‘ out of college. Some learned
to ta1k—-really to talk-—to sit
around in publications offices and
local pubs late into the night and
foist on their fellowmen their
opinions on war, eceonomics, vir-
ginity, and the value of student
government. _

And many seniors, under the
influence of the liberal ‘outlook
they acquired at college, also had
the experience of coming under
the inﬂuence of something else—-
a beverage that foams. College
was not a total loss.

Juniors Have Duty

The seniors have a lot to think.
about these days, jobs and what-
not. And"we of the Class of ’53
can relieve one of their concerns
at least. It is said that the major
worry of graduates is that the
junior class will renege on the
high ideals of school spirit, beau-
ty of spirit, respect for traditions,
and th e upward-ever—upward

questfor Truth. The junior class '

had better not be cads about
these things. ,.

Now that the grads are leaving,
it is only right to say that a few

ED JENSEN

I suppose I would be something less than human ~

if Idid not confess a, little unhappiness aboht writ-
ing this, my last, column for the News. After re-
garding the News as an avocation for almost four
years, I now ﬁnd that it «has actually been a voca-
tion; nay, a way of life and one not easily ended.
If any one has gotten anything——tangible or intan-
gible——out of this paper, Iam
certain they [have not exceeded

I may be slightly prejudiced
but it seems to me that the News
is unique among campus activi-
ties in that it is the least like-cyan
activity and for that reason far
more rewarding. One gets the
feeling that his contribution to
each paper has some value to the 
people who read it, that he is ‘in fact rendering a
service in addition to earning a key and maybe
picking up an honor or two.

there, and the girls of his office
staff added a feminine touch to
the whole business.

Speaking for the athletic
groups, Jack Hardmen remarked
that Brailey had somehow been _, H I
overlooked in the recent Varsity Day program, and
read a fake announcement from at T; J. Hamilton
citing handball ace Brailey for his outstanding con-
tributions to that sport, In the course of the eve-
ning, he also added a trophy to his collection as
wellafs two handballs and a, glove. ‘

Big Blow Up

. From YMCA president Lloyd Fuge came at least
three gifts. First‘ on the list was a balloon, into
which, Lloyd observed, could well be blown the
hot air that always cropped up at Y committee
meetings. “You must have known,” Brailey joked
to Lloyd, “that I was going to work for a gas
company.”

Painting of the dean of men's office on the
eighth floor has had a curious effect on the secre-

of the room to make way for the painters working
on the walls, the staff loks like the strap-hangers
on a rush-hour 77/54. The deans are using all
available space, including conference rooms, and a

There are other awards too: a “Glo-Bow” tie,

noted for the quality of his puns and witticisms,
had a comeback far funnier than the award ad-
dress. -

A Fine Finish

The already frequent laughs were increased ind

Phi Mu's Fete
Centennial

By ELINORE STONE

There’s never been an all-free formal dance at
Pitt.

Phi Mu Sorority, however, is plar\ming to remedy
that. Over 500 sorority" girls have already respond-
ed to their invitation to a “free-to-all” formal dance
on June 6., Invites have been sent to every sorority
on campus, plus the Phi Mu Chapter at Bucknell,
Penn State, Ohio State, Dickinson, Bethany and
Indiana State Teachers College, and to all alumni
to help join in Phi Mu’s Centenial Celebration at
this C/entenial Ball. .

Phi Mu President, Donna Jean Henry, expecting
250 to 300 replies was overwhelmed by the re-
sponse, “Maybe y_ve’11 set a precedent for other
sorority centenial celebrations,” she laughed.

The enthusiasm has resulted in seine complica-
tions, however. .Original1y set for the University
Club, the dance had to be moved to the Pittsburgh
Room of the William PenniHotel to accomodate the
crowd. ' e

The girls are also looking for a bigger orchestra.

“They released the one they had previously engaged

because it was too small for the new site and the
expected crowd.

The response has further altered the ﬁnancial
outlook a bit. By the time all's plannedland done,
thelcost is expected to reach $700.-Pitt’s Phi Mu
members and alumni will pay the price from the
treasury. A

M The ﬁrst Phi Mu Chapter was founded at Wes-
leyan College, Georgia in 1852 by Mary Daniel,
Martha Redding, and Mary Du Pont Lines. Since
then, 69 schools‘ have been given charters from
the national organization.

Pitt’s chapter was established in 1912. They
have 25 active members at present.

Fowl—ed Up

. By IRENE ROZAKIS

Most people want nothing more to do with
chickens than to have one for Sunday dinner oc-
casionally, but Dr". Ralph Buchsbaum of Pitt’s zoolo-
gy department is more interested in the social be-
havior of the barnyard fowl.

In fact, he has even taken a series of moving
pictures of chicken behavior which prove, he says,
“that man is not necessarily so
fancy when he behaves as he
does,” since chickens act amaz-
ingly like people.

When hen (the barnyard
kind, of course) meets hen, the
procedure is quite simple. “They
ﬁght,” says Dr_ Buchsbaum.

A graduate of the University
of Chicago, he has been interest-
- V ed in biological photography for
a number of years. ' .

He has shown the movie about the chickens to
a number of his zoology classes.

The movie concerns an experiment at the Uni-
versity of Chicago, in which an attempt was made
to study the various ways by which a hen recog-
nizes. her “social status.” '

Although that idea may seem a bit farfetched,
hens are actually capable of dominating or being
dominated by other hens, according to the zoolo-
gist. ~
In the experiment, ﬁve hens were put into the
same compartment. The hens then spent a little
time sparring until the most’ dominant hen took
her place at the top of the social strata.

In this same manner, the hens that ranked sec-

Pittites Face
Exam Blues

The midnight oil will be burning late this week
in many a Pitt student’s home, for ﬁnal exams be-
gin next Monday. And with the advent of ﬁnals,
many students are eyeing their stacks of'books'
and dusty typewriters and wondering just where
to begin. Some- are looking forward to all-night
cram sessions and are not only concerned with re-
membering what they will have to read, but how
to stay awake to remember it.

The seniors, who ﬁnished school last Friday,
have stored their text books, and bequeathed 8:30 '
a.m. classes to the undergraduates. They have re-
turned the borrowed typewriters and cleared their
lockers. And to the undergraduates, some have of-
fered a few hints on the problem of last-minute
cramming. ‘

According to the 1952 candidates for graduation,‘
there are various methods and means of attack-
ing the problem. One senior said that standing on
your head often helps to keep a person mentally
alert as well as wide-awake. '1 ‘

Another used ice-packs in order to keep a- cool I

mind. One senior sat all night with his feet in
a bucket of ice water. And still another confessed
that she merely drank black coffee. Blackcoffee, in’
a consensus of opinion, seems to be the most popu-
lar stimulant to sleepy-eyed students. A

‘The druggists in the local apothecaries say that
the sale of No-Doz pills has hit its usual-Spring
high. But they warn that an over-dose is sometimes
very harmful, and may counteract by causing an
extremetweariness by the time a student gets to
class the next morning. ,

But of all the methods advised, the most sen-
sible came from a studious looking young woman
who very smuglyremoved her horn-rimmed glasses
and said, “Why it’s simple, just study all year.”

ond, third and fourth in social rank were deter-
mined. The experimenters found, however, that a
fifth place hen in one group, could rise to ﬁrst
place when placed with a different group.

‘“After all,” remarked Dr. Buchsbaum, “how
many people doyou know who are idle in an or-
ganization, yet may be leaders in another group?
It's the same general idea.”

Dr. Buchsbaum’s most recent movie demon-
strates the effects of radiation on. living cells. This
one involved taking pictures through. a microscope,
a ﬁeld in which he'is deeply interested, and which,
by the way, bears the staggering name of “cine-
photomicrophagy.”

Kent State G
Mittmen’s
Home Final

 Baseball fans will get one
lnore chance to Watch the
Panthers in action here when
Kent State comes to town Satur-
day to play off the rained-out game
of Apr. 12.

The game was originally carded
as the home opener, and is the only
one of the eight washouts to be
squeezed back into the schedule.

A return battle with Allegheny
at Meadville rings down the cur-
tain on the 1952 season June 7,
with Coach Ralph Mitterling hop-
ing to ﬁnish with a. winning rec-
ord.

Pitt’s record is 6-4, which does
not include yesterday’s game with
Duquesne played after this issue

‘went to press.

Up to now, Mitterling’s rookie-

studded 'lineup has held-up re-
markably well and has paced the
Panthers in pitching and hitting.
G Freshmen Bob —Kyle and Milt
Emery currently lead the hitters
with better than .300 averages, and
Sophomores Don Shanafelt and
Dick Shannon have turned in
creditable mound performances.

T

By DON SCHURMAN

Hugh Peery will become a
member of a select, but sur-
prisingly large group of Pitt
athletic greats this summer when
he travels to Helsinki for the 15th
world Olympiad.

In all, ﬁve Pitt native sons have
preceded the bantamweight wrest-

. ler to the famed’ international

games.

All ﬁve were track specialists,
however, and only one——Johnny
Woodruff in 1936-has been able
to cop an Olympic laurel wreath.
Woodruft‘ won in the 800-meter
run. »

Tuneup at Annapolis
The most recent of the Panther

Olympians was Herb- Douglas who

placed third in the broad-jump in
1948.

Before Douglas came Don
Gwinn, hammer throw in 1928;
Frank Shea, 400 meters in 1920;
and Dick Picard, pole vault in 1924
and ’28. Picard, a native Canadian,
had to compete for Canada.

Competing in the 114.5 pound
division, Peery will be a member
of the 16-man United States catch-
-as-catch’-‘can team. He will leave
on June 28, for a practice tuneup
at Annapolis, and then sail for
I-lelinski on July 8.

pany him, however. “The cost for
the round-trip has been estimated
at $1500,” explains Hugh, “.and so
dad and I willseparate at Annap-
olis.

“Before that, though, I’ll keep
in shape by practicing with my
brother Ed at the Field House.
He’ll -give me plenty of competi-
tion, too.’? ‘

Once in Europe, however, Hugh
will have the toughest competition
of his career. And in win,ningfthe
Pan-American Olympics, the Four-
I’s, and the NCAA, in his two
years of collegiate competition, he
has had some pretty rugged
matches. .

21 Nations Compete ‘
’ His main trouble ‘will probably
come from the Turkish’ contingent.
“Turkey - walked away with the
wrestling in 1948,” Hugh says.
“This year, they even scouted and
took movies of our ﬁnals at Fort
Ames, Iowa.”

But besides Turkey, 21 other na-
tions will be competing on the
mats. “If I can stay in the com-
petition,” says Hugh, “I ﬁgure I’ll
have about eight matches.

Once there was a Senior who was quivering
on the brink of Graduation.

Three days before the Mass Exodus, a
thought struck him. “Look,” he reasoned,
“the diploma is all very well——plus the
Parental Pride and Similar Emotions, and
the tangible tokens to be expected from the
Nearest and Dearest. But--what’s wrong
with giving the Occasion more scope—-put-
ting it on a Slightly More Practical Basis?"

Next morning he arrived panting on the
doorstep of the Western Union office with a
list of all relatives living more than 100
miles away and with 1 message for all of
them. To wit: “Graduating Friday. Big Day.
Only wish you could witness the event.” Oﬁ
it went into the Wild Blue Yonder.

The take? Sensational. Eleven checks, 3
gold watch, and I. job offer from Uncle in
Altoona. He couldn't take the job. He :1-

Father Rex, who himself only‘

ropean teams with caution.

“In the international rules, the

Europeans are superior to us,” he
warns. ‘ And they’re much stronger‘

above the waist, and usually much
older than we are. ,

“Hugh will deﬁnitely h ave

For Fall Drills

Athletic ofﬁcials have not yet
decided where Pitt’s 1952 football

edition will report for fall drills in.

September.

“We are consideringl a half

dozen places -to train,” revealed
Frank Carver, athletic publicity
director, “but as yet nothing, has
been decided.” Among the places
mentioned by Carver was Lig-
onier, the mountain resort town
where Pitt camped last year.

Other possible sites are: Alliance
College in Alliance, Ohio, Alle-

. This column, Discards from the Sports Shuffle, with this

never again appear. It will be forgotten, maybe in a week

for years to come.

I realize that this column has
from timeto time had a tinge" of
bitterness, but mistakes cannot be

corrected unless
t h e y la’ r e
brought to light.
We are all guil-
ty of them but
few, can take
the c ri t i cism
that is attached
to them.
Probably my

was thinking
that Red Daw-

. son would not

be Pitt’s football coach. Pitt’s big-
gest mistake was not inviting West
Virginia and Duquesne to partici-
pate in the annual Steel Bowlbas-
ketball classic.

-Several readers accused me of
making two errors in last week’s
column.. Their argument was that
comparatively speaking Mike Mil-
ligan was a better coach than Ben
Grady. Well, that is a matter of
opinion. ,
Good Boys, Those Three

The other discrepancy was that
Bill Priatko should not. be listed
as a failure. In listing the biggest
failure at Pitt, I meant the trio
of Priatko, Dave Adams and John
Reger. Anyone who saw these
three boys open up holes for the
frosh would realize that they

Vworked as a unit for the unde-

feated frosh eleven of 1950.

I only hope that Reger returns
to‘ Pitt in the fall and that he and
Adams are as successful as Priatko
was in .spring drills. If the trio
working as a unit could show as

For the future there are several
things that I would like to see
happen: I

1. Tackles John Reger ind Otto

2. Doc Carlson’s hoopsters to
employ the freeze against Penn
State at the Field House next year
and win the game, 2-0.

3. A Commissioner of Collegiate
Athletics be appointed as a police-
man over all college athletics, with
much the same duties as Warren
Giles has in professional baseball.

4. Swimming Coach Ben Grady
to pick up a. ﬁne tank prospect,
Joe Robinson of Homestead, who
has beaten Jim Zentgraf severa
times in free style races. c

5. If and when Carlson decides
to retire, Captain Hamilton to pro-
mote him to the post of Assistant
Athletic Director. ‘Carlson in turn
to ask the Athletic Committee to
think seriously of appointing Chick
Davies to the vacated coaching
post. Don’t bet against Davies re-

Asked for
Rifle Range

Sixteen coeds-—many of whom
never handled small. pistols let
alone, .22 caliber riﬂes on Spring-
ﬁeld stocks—-form the nucleus for
Pitt’s ﬁrst coed intercollegiate
team.

Since the dean of women’s of-
ﬁce approved the girls’ rifle team
two weeks ago, the group has in-
creased in size and has shown a
wave of enthusiasm. One import-
ant barrier, however, must be
cleared before the coeds are‘per-
mitted to compete with other col-
leges next fall.

Range Must Be Remodeled _

The Stadium range must be re-
modeled by the University. “The
girls will not shoot there if altera-
tions are not made,” according to
Miss Margaret Covert, associate
professor of physical education.

The objections are not only from
the phys ed department, but even
visiting men riﬂe teams have re-
fused to shoot at the Stadium be-
cause of improper heating facili-
ties.

In a list of recommendations to
Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald, Col.
Holland, PMS&T, asked the Uni-
versity, “to spend money to ﬁx
the range.”

Shoot Live Ammo

The coeds have completed their
studies of basic range safety and
“dry” ﬁring exercises. Now they
are ﬁring live ammunition in
preparation for the fall season.

Next September, Monday and
Wednesday at 3:30 to 5 p.m. will

begreserved for girls interested in
learning the art of sharpshooting.

IF Council Loads Gun  
On Illegal Fall Rushing

Inter-fraternity Council will. put in effect ‘for the first
time this summer newlregulations to combat illegal rushing.
IF’s new rules, according to President Lud Lippert, will
imposeheavy ﬁnancial penalties on frats that Contact incom-

ing freshmen before legal rushing:

begins in the fall.

The new code provides the fol-
lowing penalties:

' First offense: a ﬁne of $100.
Second oﬂense: a ﬁne of $200.
Third offense: suspension of

social‘ privileges plus payment

of fines.

Lippert explained that ‘ social
suspension takes away the offend-
ing frat’s right to hold social and
rushing affairs in the fraternity
house.

Up to this year IF Council had

no set laws for levying of ﬁnes on
offending fraternities.

The new regulations speciﬁcally

»
\

gforbid frat men to: 1) invite‘ poten-

tial students to a social affair prior
to the legal rushing period; and
2) discuss fraternities with a po-
tential student.

Lippert explained that accusa-
tions of illegal rushing against any
fraternity will have to be sub-
stantiated by proof before a ﬁne
will be levied.

Chapel Choir
Seeks Members

Tryouts for the Heinz Chapel
Choir are being held this week in
3117 C1 every day from 4 to 4:30
p.m.

Any undergraduate student in-

Fterested in choral music can make

an appointment for a tryout with
Dr. Theodore M. Finney, director
of the choir.

Choir rehearsals are held four
days a week from 4:30 to 5:30, and
the group participates in both the
Wednesday student chapel serv-
ices, and the Sunday Vesper serv-
ices. The choir also sings weekly
on “Music and Meditation,” a
WDTV program. 

A camping period, lasting ﬁve
days, provides preparation for the
fall semester, and a spring concert
tour gives choir members a chance
to sing in other cities. '

Now Definite for Fall

l

A student trip to an away-from—ho,me football game next ‘ ”
fall was called “deﬁnite” today by Stan Goldmann, acting
co-chairman of a commitee working on the project. _

But ﬁnal plans will not be made public until the begin-.

ning of the fall semester.
Goldman disclosed that a poll,
taken last week to determine what
football game students most want-
ed to see, revealed that a major-
ity were in favor of the Army
game. ’
But'on1y 125 students partici-
pated in.the poll, and at least 300

would be needed to send a student
train to West Point’ next Oct. 18,
Goldman said.

‘The committee will
inquire about the cost of sending
busses to» the game, instead of a
train. The planning group is still
not ruling out the possibility of

THE poncumu:

H65 listened to the weak thread of so many
shallow claims he’s xfed-up! His point is——there’s
a thorough test of cigarette mildness. Millions

of smokers throughout America concur.

A It’s the sensible test. . .the 30-Day Camel V
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try
Camels as your steady smoke-on a day—after-day,
pack-after-pack hasis. No snap judgments!

Once you’ve tried Camels in your “T-Zone” (T for

Thiolat, T for Taste) you’ll see why. . .‘

therefore «

sending a train to the Notre Dame

and Ohio State games, it Army

does not prove feasible. 0
‘Final plans will be drafted this
summer for the trip to be spon-
sored by Student Congress, Pitt
News, and Alumni Association.
