Union Officials Rally
For Staff Support

ByBOBLABRIOLA
Pitt News Staffwriter

Representatives of the Service
Employees International Union
(ISEIU) Local 925 sent out a plea for
union approval at a rally in the
Soldier’s and Sailor’s Memoial Hall
last Thursday.

The rally, held exactly two weeks
prior to the June 7 election,
attracted approximately 125 of
Pitt’s 1,700 clerical and technical
workers to listen to a program of
union officials and University staff
members.

According to Rosemary Trump,
international vice-president of
SEIU, the University is promoting a
viscious anti-union campaign de-
signed to confuse and develop fear
in staff members prior to the
election.

“If their campaign was success-
ful, management could cut out any
beneﬁts or make a wage cut, and
you (the employees) would have no
recourse,” said Trump.

Trump also alleged that an
advertisement placed in the May
23, 1978, issue of The Pitt News by
the anti-union Vote No Committee,
which stated that employees at
Allegheny Community College
became dissatisﬁed and attempted
to have their SEIU local decertiﬁed,
is false. - 0

James Barrett, head of employee
relations at ACC, also denied
knowledge of the action alleged in
the advertisement.

“There may have been some
employees who were disenchanted
with the union,” said Barrett, “but

Revised Policy Guidelines Clarify Tenure Procedures

I Pitt News Staff Writer
Revised tenure policy guidelines
and faculty appeals procedures

recently passed by the Board of

Trustees update and clarify old
policy statements governing these
two areas.

Instructors may now be ap-

pointed for three years instead of

only one; associate professors can
be appointed without being ten-
ured, and the title of associate
professor or professor may be
bestowed on special faculty outside
the tenure stream who are hired on
a temporary basis.

Katangan rebels will eventually
overrun Zaire and force President

 Mobutu Sese Seko out of ofﬁce,

‘ -ccording to a Pitt professor in the

Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA). >

Dr. Daivd Gould, who alternates

0 his GSPIA position with aiteaching

position at the National University

of Zaire,’ described Mobutu’s reign

as “the most corrupt ruling elite in

the world.”

The new tenure policy increases
the probationary period for associ-
ate professors or professors to
three to four years, and makes
part-time faculty working at Pitt at
least half-time eligible for tenure.

New faculty appeals procedures
create a University-wide pool from
which the different schools and
departments may draw people to
sit on appeals panels, and allows
the Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committee (TAF) of the University
Senate a less formal role in the
appeals process.

Associate Provost David Powers
reported that most revisions in the

Gould was the guest lecturer ‘at
the International Development
Forum held in the GSPIA lounge,
sponsored by GSPIA students last

' Thursday.

tenure policy clarify the phrasing of
old documents or increase the
policy’s ﬂexibility. I

The clause permitting associate
professors to be appointed without
tenure helps to prevent other
universities from approaching fa-
culty from,Pitt with the offer of an
associate professorships.

“With this change we can match
offers from outside the Unversity, ”
said Powers. ‘ ‘I don’t think this will
be done often, but at least we now
have the ability to do so.”

Lengthening the probationary
period for faculty also increases
ﬂexibility, Powers said. Under the

old provisions, a two-year proba-
tion forced administrators to
evaluate a faculty member after he
worked at Pitt for only one year.
The longer probation allows evalu-
ators to observe faculty over a
greater period of time.

Provisions that grant tenure to
half-time faculty are the result of a
University Senate decision made in
1974. Departments can now hire
faculty on a part-time basis when
the faculty is unable to accept a
full-time appointment. Part-time
appointments are designed espe-
cially for women who have family

responsibilities, according to Pow-
ers.

Since these half-time faculty
members have all the responsibili-
ties of full-time faculty, they -are
now also eligible for tenure.

Powers also explained that the
statement about the purposed

obligations and responsibilities of I

tenure was a needed part of the
tenure policy.

“This statement is something
that had been missing previously, ”
Powers said. “It is consistent with

national statements and other
University statements about ten-

“This is what we helped create
and I think we ought to step out——let
the rotten apple fall,” Gould said.

Gould added that Belgian,
French, and American intervention"
in the recent Zaire struggle was
partly responsible for the reported’
massacres of hundreds of Euro-
peans. He said the massacres were
executed in order to create panic
among the white population of
Zaire. - - ’

“The massacre would not have

been nearly as bad if there had not
been intervention,” he said.

Gould accused The New York
Times and The Washington Post of
reporting false accounts of rapes,
looting and tortures by the rebels.

“However, the killing of women
and children—-there is no explana-
tion for tha ,” he said.

Gould called the Zaire situation

“a good example‘ of historical —
. processes of developmen .” '

“The crisis in Zaire is not
unique,” he said. “There are

crisises like this throughout the
world.”

Gould cited two theories of
development in third world
countries such as Zaire--the
modernization theory and the
dependency theory.

In the dependance theory “the
problems of developing countries
are mainly caused by the countries
themselves,” he said. “What they
need ' are more Western recipes,

Pitt Physicist Conducts His Own Soccharin Test

Cohen then performed similar tests on A

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

The consumption of artiﬁcially sweetened
soft drinks results in the loss of nine seconds of
your 1ife——or up to about two days overall if you
drink one can of diet soda every day for the rest
of your life-—according to Pitt physicist Dr.
Bernard L. Cohen. .

Cohen recently undertook a comparative
study of the effects of consuming artiﬁcially
sweetened soft drinks containing saccharin, a
substance reported by the Federal Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to increase the
chances of human bladder cancer.

Cohen said he did not perform any
laboratory tests on saccharin itself but instead
accepted the data recorded by the FDA, which
found saccharin in low-calorie soft drinks and
all other artiﬁcially sweetened products to be a
prime cancer-producing agent in human
beings.

The initial study claimed that if every
American were to consume one 12-ounce diet
drink each day for the rest of his life, the end
result -would be the production of 1,200
additional bladder malignancies each year.

In his investigation, Cohen divided the total
number of drinks into the total number of
malignancies among the population. The
result was multiplied by 20 years (the number
of years the human life expectancy is
decreased by cancer).

Cohen’s net result proved that for every
artiﬁcially sweetened soft drink consumed, the
human life expectancy would be decreased by
approximately nine seconds per drink. For a
person who consumed one 12-ounce drink each
day of his life, a lifetime reduction of.
approximately two days would occur.

Cohen compared that loss to that incurred by
cigarette smoking, which amounts to
approximately 12 minutes per cigarette.

sugar-sweetened soft drinks. A 12-ounce can
of sugar-sweetened soda pop (containing
approximately 100 calories) was compared to
the artificially sweetened beverages (contain-
ing a neglible number of calories).

Cohen deduced that if all other variables in
the experiment remained equal in the
experiment, the consumption of dietetic soft
drinks in place of the non-dietetic beverages
would increase the probable life expectancy by
as much as 100 times more than the probability
of triggering any malignancy. .

“In short, what I was trying to do was not to
prove any discrepencies in the findings of any
other studies done, but instead show a basis for
comparison of the health risks involved with
saccharin and without, Cohen said. “And
from this I have shown that the hazards of
drinking sugar-sweetened products by far
outweigh those of drinking the products
containing saccharin.

State Budget Signed By Shapp

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG - Governor Shapp
yesterday signed a 35.36 billion
general spending package for
1978-79 that restores funding for
abortion and slashes a $50 million
increase for public schools.

The budget is $100 million less
than the one approved last week by
the Legislature, which hammered
out the most speedily produced
spending package in the last 16
years.

The record budget, which will
reach $5.76 billion when money for

state-related universities is added,

represents an increase of 6.6
percent over the current budget.

“I must veto a number of items
to bring this budget into balance as
is required by the constitution and
by my pledge not to leave the
Commonwealth’s ﬁscal affairs in
the same sorry shape I found
them,” said Shapp, who issued a
statement after signing the bill in
private.

“This is a balanced budget, I
must warn that if the Legislature
wishes to restore the cuts 1 am
making by overriding my line
vetoes, it must ﬁrst provide

increased revenues to cover the
cost of these programs,” said
Shapp, signing his ﬁnal budget
four weeks before the new ﬁscal
year starts.

But legislative leaders indicated
they may take issue with the
-Governor’s vetoes. 4

“It’s probably a good bet that an
override attempt will be made on
the Governor's veto,” said House
majority leader James Manderino.

The House and Senate inserted
language in the budget that said no
state money could be used to fund
abortions.

ure.” “It is not very detailed, but
it’s something.”

The new faculty appeals princi-
ples and procedures respond to a
request by the TAF that its role in

appeals be clariﬁed.
“TAF believed they should not

be part of the formal appeals
system, but complementary to it,”
said Powers.

The provost, three other admin-
istrators and four faculty members
on the University Senate prepared
the appeals procedures.

The secretary of the University
chose by lot members of the
appeals panels from a pool
consisting of all tenured faculty
within the University. The pool

attempts to supply unbiased faculty
to hear appeals of tenure or
re-appointment decisions.

Schools with enough faculty
members may establish their own
appeals pool. Powers said the
schools of Medicine, Education,
Engineering, and the College of
Arts and Sciences Johnstown
campus have indicated some
interest in creating their own
appeals panels.

“The rest of the schools believe
they aren’t large enough to get a
neutral independent pool,” said
Powers.

Although a hearing board may
review appeals panel decisions, the

Western economics and tech-
nology. ”

Gould said tne dependency
theory best describes Zaire’s case.

‘ ‘With the dependency theory the
major problems are not internal but
several historical processes having
to do with external forces,” he said.

Gould cited external forces as the
French and Belgian colonial powers
throughout the century and Russian
and Cuban inﬂuences today.

Gould added that the 200 tribes in
Zaire “had a certain form of
harmonious development prior to
Belgian penetration” in the late
19th century.

Gould said the elite power system
in Zaire would eventually bring
about its downfall.

“While the elite (in Zaire) are of
the richest in the world (because of
heavy. mining industry throughout
the country), Zaire is also one of the
poorest countries in the world,”

Grocery Prices Show Large Increase

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Consumers were battered by a 2.4 percent
monthly increase in grocery prices in April and a 0.9 percent hike in
overall prices, the worst in more than a year, the Government -said
yesterday.

The price of beef was up by a record 6.6 percent during the month,
surpassing the previous monthly high of 6.5 percent in May 1975.

The April consumer price index conﬁrmed the gloomy predictions
of Carter Administration economists that inﬂation in the economy is
worsening, although they still expect relief later in the year.

Prices increased during the last three months at an annual rate of
10 percent, which if continued for the entire year, would make 1978
the worst year for inﬂation since 1975, when prices rose 12.2
percent. ‘

However, one key Government economist said it would be a
mistake to expect inﬂation to continue to worsen at the same pace as
during the ﬁrst few months of the year.

Debris Scatters Over Mile As Plant Explodes

By The Associated Press

TITUSVILLE, PA.-—A nitroglycerin plant was left a smoking ruin
yesterday when a 380-quart tank of the volatile oil exploded,
sending metallic debris ﬂying for three quarters of a mile.

Four men escaped injury when they fled the building only
moments before the tank blew up.

The blast destroyed the Otto. Cupler Torpedo Company plant
outside this northwestern Pennsylvania community. Debris ﬂew
more than half a mile in all directions and the explosion could be
heard six miles away.

“There’s no factory anymore, just a huge hole in the ground,”
said Clarence Bromley, a retired Titusville police chief who started
work at the rural plant three weeks ago.

The explosion occurred when a flash ﬁre ignited a nitrater, a
machine used to treat glycerin and a mixture of nitric and sulfuric
acids in the process of making nitroglycerin, Bromley said.

“We were just getting ready to dump it when we had the ﬂash
ﬁre,” said machine operator Emerson Campbell. “What caused the
ﬂash ﬁre I don’t know.”

Fifty-five Possible Depictions For
New Dollar Coin Announced

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Suffragist Susan B. Anthony is the popular
leader for depiction on the new $1 coin, but she has 54 rivals for the
honor, including Klondike Kate, the Virgin Mary and Elvis Presley,

Most of the competitors are easily recognizable, like Helen
Keller, Eleanor Roosevelt or, for that matter, Presley. But what
about Kitty “Bulldog” 0’Leary?

The Treasury Department sent to Congress yesterday a list of the
persons and symbols suggested by citizens who have written the
Government since plans for a small $1 coin were announced.

During this process, a movement sprang up to have the proposed
coin bear the face of a real American woman.

as far as I know, there was never a
serious move toward decertiﬁca-
tion.”

Barrett explained that the
decertiﬁcation process begins with
the employees drawing up a
petition stating their displeasure.
The petition is then presented to
management and would pass
through the Ofﬁce of Employee
Relations.

“No employee or group of
employees has brought a petition
around, so if there is any
disatisfaction, they are not going
about getting it taken care of in a
professional way,” Barrett said.

Although the advertisement was
paid for with a personal check, the
payer refused to give The Pitt News
any information concerning either
the Vote No Committee or the
sources used to uncover the alleged
employee-union friction at ACC.
The Pitt News was also unable to

discern the identities of any of the -

other members of the Vote No
Committee. ‘

Union ofﬁcials and Pitt staff
members agreed that there is more
support for the union among the
older University employees than
when the union was defeated in
1976.

“People are tired of manage-
ment doing whatever they want,”

strative secretary. “Many olderl

staff members who voted against
the union in 1976 are now
pro-union because of manage-
ment’s latest job reclassiﬁcation.”

Robinson and Karen Nussbaum,
a member of SEIU Local 585, stated
that union approval will not
necessarily result in further tuition
hikes. _

“It has been my experience that
things like increases in gas and
electric rates have more of an effect
on tuition than any employee
beneﬁts that would result if the
staff decides it wants to unionize,”
said Nussbaum.

“The University likes to use
union approval as a cause for
tuition increases, but we’ve got to
use some common sense,” Robin-
son said. “I would want to see the
numbers and make sure the money
couldn’t come from anywhere else
before I’d believe the union caused
a tuition increase.”

Robinson added that the only
way the union will be defeated is if
staff members do not come out to
vote as a result of the “University’s
propaganda.”

Some employees, including
Roseann Lederer, a senior secre-
tary for the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
admit that Pitt offers its employees
“a pretty good beneﬁt program,”
but that staff members now want
those fringe beneﬁts in writing.

Appeals Procedures

The new Faculty Appeals principles and procedure format is a
welcome improvement over the appeals procedures that formerly
existed at Pitt.

Before these guidelines were approved, appeals procedures were
a mishmash of vague directives compounded over a score of years.
‘No one document combined those directives into a coherent
statement.

The new guidelines outline the steps aggrieved faculty members
should follow when they believe they have been unfairly denied
reappointment or tenure.

If any instructor wants to challenge denial of reappointment he
has two options. He or she may either ask the provost“ or Chan-
cellor to reconsider the decision or request that an appeals panel
review. the reappointment decision and recommend appropriate ac-
tion.

The panel idea adds a new, step to the review process, which
promises to make the appeals process much more fair. Members of
the appealspanel are chosen at random from a pool of tenured
faculty and include only those people who have had no prior con-
tact with the case. This step promises to insure that faculty mem-
bers receive the fairest hearing possible.

Despite this great improvement in the appeals procedure, one
serious flaw exists in the process—faculty members must request
written reasons for non-renewal before requesting an appeals panel
hearing.

Written statements about denial of tenure could threaten ‘the
future employment opportunities of faculty members. Associate
Provost David Powers admits written statements about appoin-
ment denials could hurt a professor when he goes job hunting at
other colleges and universities.

Although Powers admits to that, he believes the requirement of a
written statement does not present much of a problem. He points
out that the University has never publicized statements about the
reasons for denial in past appeals cases.

He is right. The University has been fair in past cases, but the
requirement still presents a threat to faculty members. This
requirement may deter faculty members who want an appeal but
are afraid of the impact of a written statement in their records.
Justice may be denied these fearful professors.

The solution to this problem is simple. A written guarantee can
promise faculty members the reasons for denial will be kept con-
fidential. If such a promise is tacked onto the faculty appeals
procedures, it could be a much better document than it already is.

Letters to the Editor

The Reinecke Report on Unionnization

lam a Pitt secretary who believes
we are being lied to by none other
than Gus Reinecke. I am just an
ordinary woman who is trying to do
my job, make a decent wage and try
to make ends meet. I am just like
most secretaries at the University
and am even afraid to sign my name
for fear of my supervisor. But I
believed I had an obligation to my
fellow secretaries to write this letter
so they would know the truth.

The reason I felt this way was
because of the many letters and
memos we have been receiving
from Mr. Reinecke. Mr. Reinecke
stated in his first letter that he
would be objective. He’s being
anything but objective—he hasn’t
said one good thing about the union,
and from experience, I know there
are many good things. The letters
he's been sending us are so
one-sided that it sounds like he is
trying to brainwash us.

He’s not not being fair to the
union and deﬁnitely not to us. There
are two sides to every story but

we’re only hearing one from Mr.
Reinecke. He says he's just trying
to help us make up our minds, but it
seems to me that he doesn’t think
we have minds. He’s not giving us
pros and cons but rather telling us
“for our own good” that we should
vote against the union because “big
brother” (the University) will take
care of us.

I have not been involved at all in
the union but I do know of other
secretaries just like me who are.
Mr. Reinecke is trying to make it
look like the “union” is going to
come in and take over, but in fact
the union is made up of just ordinary
secretaries like myself. I am
certainly more inclined to believe
someone who has the same
problems as myself than . any
administrator who makes ﬁve times
as much as I do. What does he know
about supporting a family of three
on $650 a month?

We have nothing to fear about the
union, but we do have to fear
someone who says they know

what’s best for us when they can’t
even begin to wear our shoes. In
Mr. Reinecke’s last letter, he tells
us that if we have any questions we
can just ask our supervisors. Come
now, Mr. Reinecke; do you think our
supervisors are going to be
.objective? That’s like King George
telling the early American colonists
to ask the Tories about declaring
independence. And talk about
scare tatics...this is really scary.

I have to admit, I was one of those
fence sitters until I began to receive
those letters from Mr. Reinecke that
are so ﬁlled with untruths. One
good thing Mr. Reinecke did was to
help me make my decision when it
comes tovoting for administrators
who say they care (but clearly
don’t). My vote is for us
(secretaries).

I also would like to urge all my

fellow secretaries not to be‘

intimidated by your supervisors and
administrators.

SEATTLE-—Six months ago,
Charles Johnson’s basketball
career seemed to be ﬁnished.

Now he's a playoff hero, having
scored Six points in overtime
Tuesday night as the Washington
Bullets upset the Seattle Super-
Sonics, 120-116, and tied their
National Basketball Association
championship series at 2-2. Game
ﬁve of the best-of-seven playoff
ﬁnals will be played here Friday
night, with game six at the Capital
Centre in Landover, Md., Sunday
afternoon.

iv Cut loose by the Golden State

Warriors early in the season, the 29-
year-old Johnson waited by the

phone for some club to call, ﬁguring
one of the NBA’s 22 teams could use
an experienced guard who was good
enough to start for the Warrior
when they won the title in 1975.
For awhile, the phone didn’t ring.

“I knew I could play in this
league, ” said Johnson. “I felt I had
proven myself. All I needed was the
right situation.”

That sifuation de ed in
mid-January when the Bullets
learned that Phil Chenier’s back
injury would keep him out the rest of
the season.

“To be perfectly honest, we
weren’t particularly looking for
Johnson,” said Bullets General
Manager Bob Ferry. “We had a

Sports

number of people in mind.
But we were able to reach him and
he said he was in shape, so we gave
him a look.”

Johnson, who played in the same
backcourt as Chenier at the
University of California, joined the
Bullets in dramatic fashion on Jan.
24, arriving by helicopter that
landed in the Capital Centre
parking lot 20 minutes before the
Bullets were to play Detroit.

Pitt Eighth in Conference;

competition at the Central Collegi-

By clearing the qualifying
standard of 7-1, he will join

McDonald was an easy victor in

-1 Johnson Goes from I-las-Been to Hem in Six Short Months

After the all-day ﬂight from the
West Coast and helicopter ride, he
spent 20 minutes getting dressed,
taking a physical, signing a 10-day
contract, warming up and learning
the Bullets’ offense, then scored six
points in a victory over the Pistons.

It’s been a joyride ever since. He
has become the Bullets’ number-

three guard, the man they turn to‘

for outside shooting off the bench,
and has averaged 8.3 points in 21
minutes per game. And he has a
new three-year contract to show for
his work. '

Now he's in the playoff ﬁnals,
gunning for his second NBA title in
six pro seasons. And it appears he

gets better as each playoff series
wears on_.

“He didn’t have a basket until
halfway through the San Antonio
series,” said Bullets coach Dick
Motta, referring to Washington’s
quarter-ﬁnal opponent. “Then he
averaged 20 points per game.”

“In the ﬁrst two games of the
Philadelphia series he didn’t score a
point,” said Bullets star Elvin
Hayes, talking about the Eastern
Conference ﬁnals. “Then he

started getting it down.”

The ﬁrst three games against
Seattle were nothing to write home
about as Johnson scored just 19
points on woeful 8-for-25 shooting
from the ﬁeld.

Last year, Boyd was both cross
country and track MVP; he
received the award again this year

from the cross country team, and
established a new Schenley Park
course record.

While ﬁnishing second in the
conference meet cross country
championships, Boyd qualiﬁed for
the NCAA Championships. Today
in Eugene he will compete in the
national 5,000-meter trials.

1978 has been a successful year
for McDonald, who ﬁnished fourth
at the Central Collegiates in cross
country, broke several individual
school records and could enter
either the 5,000 or 10,000 meters at
nationals; he will most likely
choose to compete in the latter.

After a much-improved junior
year, it looked as though'Goodyear
would be expected to repeat as well
as surpass his 1977 achievements.

That he has done. So far this
year, he has won the college
division of the Penn Relays, both
Pitt indoor and outdoor invitation-
als, tied for the Indoor Central .
Collegiate championship and, more
recently, tied his own Pitt record of
7-1 by winning the outdoor Central
Collegiate meet in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

Tom Landry Can Tmly Be Called ."ﬂte Coach's Coach’

0 It is a recognized fact that praise from one’s
peers is the most valid and the most difficult to ob-
tain. In this light, it is significant to note that Tom
Landry of the Dallas Cowboys was chosen as the best
coach in the NFL by his fellow coaches. Landry
edged Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins, 12 votes to
11.

The most emphatic Landry supporters were Red

1': iller of the Denver Broncos and Chuck Knox of the

Los Angeles Rams (now of the Buffalo Bills).

“I think Landry gets his team ready to play in the
big games consistently better than anybody else,”
said Miller, whose Broncos were defeated by the
Cowboys in Super Bowl XII. ,

“Landry is innovative with all his multiple for-
mations in the flex defense,” said Knox, “and it
takes guts to be innovative.”

Three coaches abstained from the voting: ,Bud
Wilkinson on the-grounds that he was unfamiliar
with his new set of peers; Bud Grant of the Min-
nesota Vikings on the grounds that “any coach who

(  answers that question is crazy,” and Pittsburgh’s
‘ I iChuck Noll, who chose to cast his vote for Paul

Brown. _
The New York Jets’ Walt Mlchaels chose someone

not renowned for his coaching abilities—Oakland
Raiders managing General Partner Al Davis.

0 Scotty Bowman, coach of the Montreal
Canadiens, will prove that men rarely realize how

good they have it when he leaves the Canadiens to
take the head coaching job with the New York
Rangers.

0 The San Francisco Giants have recorded the
largest increase in attendance in the major leagues for
this stage in the season, while the Atlanta Braves
have recorded the largest decrease in 1978. In a
recent Jacket Day promotion, the Giants drew more
than 56,0()O fans to Candlestick Park, while the
Pirates could manage only 27,000 for the same
promotion.

0 One of the major raps against Manny Sanguillen
was that he would be a defensive liability to the
Pirates if he played behind the plate. In veiw of Mike

Schmidt’s three stolen bases against the Pirates in a

recent game, it is difficult to imagine Sanguillen‘

being any worse.

0 NFL schedule makers decide on an early season
meeting for the Baltimore Colts and New England
Patriots because they believe there won’t be as much
drinking in the stands when the weather iswarmer,
thereby creating less problems for the police.

0 The 1978 Tim Rossovich Memorial Award goes
to Bill Neal, Green Bay middle guard, for breaking
soda pop bottles by placing them in the cradle of his
arm and then bending it.

0 The Minnesota Viking pick of Randy Holloway
markes the third year in a row the Norsemen chose a
defensive lineman in the initial round of the NFL
draft.

0 Anyone who is a regular reader of the want ads
noticed that the Pitt track team is in the market for a
new assistant coach. As the situation stands at the
present time, senior distance man Dave McDonald
appears to have the inside track.

0 National League rookie umpire J oe West and the
rest of John Kibler’s crew have been responsible for
50 of the 65 balk calls made this season. West has
even gone so far as to throw the organ player out of
the stadium for playing “Three_Blind Mice” as the-
umpires took the field before a game.
