IFC misappropriation causescontroversy

Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

The decision by the Student Activities Of-
fice last term to enforce a dry rush is thought
to be one of the motivations leading to a
misappropriation of $350 at the end of last
term.

According to Bridget Guernsey, Glen
Cooper, treasurer of the Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil, allowed $350 collected from dues by the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity to be spent on
a happy-hour function sponsored by the IFC
without her approval.

Both Guernsey and Rick Platt, student
public relations representative at the IFC, said

that there were more executive council"
_ members involved in the misappropriation,

but since Cooper is the treasurer he will be
held responsible. ”His duties are such that
he's responsible,” said Guernsey. ”But he is
not the only one to be faulted.”

Platt said the event occurred roughly every
other week, each time at a different fraterni-
ty. The week it was to come to Phi Gamma

Delta, Guernsey asked that it be cancelled
for that week so that more concentration
might be placed on a sports awards banquet
sponsored by the IFC. ”The board, after go-
ing through a lot of problems with the dry
rush and everything, was mad,” said Platt.
”They decided to have a happy hour
anyway.”

Guernsey said that she was told by the ex-
ecutive council that the event would not oc-
cur. ”The problem is the executive board tell-
ing me one thing and then telling the frater-
nity they're going to do something else,” said
Guernsey.

”Everyone wants to exist with as little con-
trol as possible. When the dry rush issue
came up, that upset a lot of people because
they felt they had no choice,” said Gurnsey.
"So then when some other things came up
in the IFC, the attitude was, ‘Well, let's do
what we want to do.”’

When asked if the IFC planned to replace
the money spent on the function, Platt said
it felt the expenditure fell into the category
ofan IFC-sponsored event and was therefore
justified.

”The board said, ‘We submitted rules that

we wanted to have for dry rush,’ and they
said, ‘No, you're not doing that; you're go-
ing to go by our rules/” said Platt. ”So,
basically, the board was doing absolutely
nothing, they were just figure heads. They got
tired of that and said, ‘We're tired of getting
pushed around by everything you guys say.’
So they decided to have the happy hour as
planned.”

Platt said this is part of a larger problem be-
tween the IFC and the Office of Student Ac-
tivities. ”We don't work together well at all,"
he said. ’’I hope that Bridget Guernsey
realizes that and opens her eyes and maybe
tries to put a little more effort into working
together.”

Nasos Georgiadis, who was president of
the IFC, has since resigned because he
graduated. ”The sad part is when it comes
right down to it, all the punishment goes to
Glen Cooper because he is the treasurer,”
said Platt. ”And the thing that's even worse
is now Nasos, who was so vehemently for
this happy hour and doing this, isn't here
anymore to take any of the blame.”

Last week, it was mistakenly reported that
Bruce Monsour, president of Phi Gamma

Delta, was involved directly in the misuse of
the $350.
The news that he altered a document, in-

creasing an allocation from $80 to $180, sur— _

prised the other members of his fraternity.
Some were angered that his mistake might
harm the reputation of Phi Gamma Delta.

"It went to a pool tournament that was
sponsored by lFC,” said Platt. ”He didn't take
any of the money himself. None of it was
used for his own personal benefit.”

Guernsey filed the report with the Judicial
Affairs Office and said that the judiciary board
would not take into consideration why he did
it, but only what he did. ’’If I were given a
university document and I altered it, I could
be fired, whether it was $5 or $500,” said
Guernsey. ”|t~'-s not the dollar amount, but
that a university document that I had signed
and given to someone had been altered.
That's the issue.” 0

Platt said several times that he hopes it is
understood that Phi Gamma Delta is not
responsible. ”Don’t drag us down with all this
because we didn't support any of it, especial-
ly with Bruce Monsour,” said Platt. ”They did
this not as F|j|'s, but as IFC representatives."

It is 10:30 on a Wednesday morn-
ing and the drop-in room at the Peo-
p|e’s Oakland Community Center,
located at 231 Oakland Ave., is
crowded. The drop-in room opens its
doors at 10:00 and is then filled with
people. They talk and listen to each
other without fear of being ridiculed.
Unemployment and discrimination
are some of the problems that they
share. They are the mentally disad-
vantaged of Oakland.

The drop-in room, according to
Ron Gibson, vocational assistant at
the People's Oakland, ”gives people
something to do during the day.”
Gibson, a former mental patient, is
acutely aware of the needs of the
mentally disadvantaged and the op-
portunity that the drop-in room pro-

”Most mental patients are friends
of mental patients and unless they
have a place to meet, they will be
unable to get together,” he said.

A place to get together is extreme-
ly important because, in Gibson's
words, ”the mentally ill are scorned
by a lot of people.” He also said that
he believes this happens because the
mentally ill look different from other
people.

”We cannot afford to dress as well.
Sometimes we don't’ have interper-
sonal or social skills to communicate
with. The drop-in room gives us a
place to talk and be together,” Gib-
son said.

The drop-in room is one of the
many services provided by the Peo-

" p|e’s Oakland. Originally conceived
as a community planning agency in
1971, People's Oakland now
specializes in assisting the mentally

The shift in emphasis was a gradual
one. Maureen Cook, vocational
director, explained how the change
came about.

’’In the early '70s, many people
were released from Polk State
Hospital, which was for the mental-
ly retarded, and people were released
from Mayview and Woodville State
hospitals, which were also for the
mentally ill.”

Cook said that many of the Polk pa-
tients released grew up in the
hospital, and that those released from
Woodville and Mayview were there
for 15 years or more.

Cook went on to say that Oakland
and East Liberty became a dumping
ground for the patients because of the
mental health resources located
there. Cook also said that many of the
former patients began to appear at the
People's Oakland for help and aid.

Branch campus

Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

The original purpose of Pitt's branch campus at Greensburg
may have been to supply the Oakland campus third-year
students, but many students plan to stay there to complete
their degree programs, according to Carl Poke, dean of in-
struction at _UPG.

Many students at UPG have the option to remain and com-
plete their degree at Greensburg or transfer to the Oakland
campus after two years. About half of these students transfer
to Oakland.

Ed Crist, president of the Student Government Association,
said that he enjoys the intimacy of a smaller campus.
"Students here are a name more than number,” he said. ’’I
don't want to be a number.”

UPG was threatened with the possibility of becoming a two-
year institution only a year ago when a report from Provost
Roger Benjamin stated ”the possibility of integrating UPG
with CGS [College of General Studies] will be kept in mind.”

still growing despite obstacles

Had this gone into effect, it would have meant not only
the elimination of its four-year degree programs, but would
also eradicate faculty tenure. UPG rejected the idea and
formed a committee to work to maintain the school's four-
year status.

The first four-year program, management, was introduced
to the curriculum in 1971. Since then, 12 other bachelor’s
degree progams have been added, including administration
of justice, English writing, psychology and political science.

Rick Fogle, director of student life, speculated that one
reason students may stay to complete the degree is that UPG
is closer to home for many of them. ”For those who work
and commute, they can balance it easier,” he said.

Economic reasons are also a major consideration for those
students opting to finish at UPG. Paula Dziedzic, a junior
majoring in English writing, said she initially enrolled at UPG
”because of cost." Many students cited the fact that UPG is
a less expensive alternative.

Ronna Sarsfield, a third-year management major, said that
although cost was a deciding factor, she is continuing her
degree at UPG for the program.

”For the longest time, I was thinking about transferring, but

whenever I started looking at the programs, I decided to stay
here. I think Greensburg offers a better ' program than
Oakland,” she said.’

However, Sarsfield said that she participates in the student
activities provided by the Pitt Program Council in Oakland.

Bob Armstrong, a senior English writing major, said that
one of the disadvantages of attending the Greensburg cam-
pus is a lack of nightlife one could experience as a student
in Oakland.

”There are some things to do, but Greensburg doesn't have
the flavor of a big city,” he said.

UPG may not supply the atmosphere that can be found
in Oakland but Joel Lawson, a junior majoring in political
science, expects it to increase in size.

But Guy Rossetti, dean of administration, stressed that UPG
is in desperate need of facilities. "In the past four or five years,
we have grown over 33 percent in terms of student popula-
tion. We have close to 1,500 students, but yet the smallest
physical plant of any other regional campus,” said Rossetti.

Some of the spacial problems will be alleviated later this
year when Powers Hall, which currently houses classrooms
and a library, is expanded.

BEVERLY H|LLS,California —— A
13-hour hostage drama ended early
Tuesday morning with three hostages
dead,and the gunman who took the
hostages in police custody.
Authorities said the ordeal began
Mondayafternoon when a gunman
walked into the exclusive Van Cleef
and Arpels jewelry store on Rodeo
Drive and attempted to rob the
store,but botched the attempt. The
gunman then took five hostages,and
a 13-hour standoff began. More than
50 police,including a crack SWAT
team,surrounded the store.The gun-
man told police on a telephone that
he had ”only wanted to rob the
store,” and he did not plan on tak-
ing any hostages. The gunman said
he had bought some jewelry at the
store once,and ”they had robbed
him.”So, now he was robbing them
back. Early Tuesday morning the gun-
man made a dramatic escape attempt
according to police. Police said he
tied three of the hostagestogether as
a sort of shield and tried to escape out
the back door.Police said at that point
they ”confronted them," and at least
one shot was fired,a|ong with tear gas
canisters,and concussion grenades.
One hostage was shot to death at that
point,although police are still in-
vestigating whether the bullet that
killed the hostage came from police

or the gunman. Police said two
bodies were found inside the
store,and they had apparently been
” killed execution style.” The suspect
was driven away from the scene in
a squad car,and taken to a
hospital,though the extent of his in-
juries was not immediately known.

Reagan to appeal
for aid to Contras

WASHlNGTON,D.C. — The White
House said Tuesday that President
Reagan plans to send a written
message to Congressmen,asking for
support of his $100 million aid
package for the Contras. Ear|ier,the
President asked Speaker of the House
Tip O'Neil if he could address the
House in person,but O'Neil turned
him down.O’Nei| said he turned
down the President's request because
it was ”unprecedented”,but it would
be okay if the President would ad-
dress the House and the Senate.Presi-
dent Reagan said he was ’’deeply
disappointed" with O’Nei|’s deci-
sion. A vote on the President's aid
package is slated for Wed nesday,after
having failed to pass the House
earlier. The Senate has already pass-

JOHANNESBURG,South Africa —
South African police said Tuesday

Korean summit
turned down

SEOUL,South Korea — A Spokesman
said Tuesday that the United States
and South Korea have formally turn-
ed down a North Korean proposal for
a three-way summit.North Korea pro-
posed the summit apparently to
discuss ways to reduce tension on the
Korean Peninsula.The spokesman
also said the United States and South
Korea sent separate replies to North
Korea. The United States message
reportedly said the North Koreans
should use existing mechanisms to

discuss the issues,whi|e the South
Korean message reportedly said the
North Korean proposal was
”unreasonable."

Tax reform to
pass easily

WASHlNGTON,D.C. — The Senate
is preparing to vote on the tax reform
bill soon,and there is little suspense
as to the outcome.Passage of the
measure is almost certain to be over-
whelming,althgough it will apparent-
ly not be unanimous. Critics of the
bill contend it will hurt the middle
c|ass,and at least one
Senator,Michigan Democrat Carl
Levin,said he will not vote for the
measure. Once the Senate passes the
bill,it must be reconciled with a
much different version passed last
week by the House.Both Measures
would curtail tax breaks in return for
lower rates,but they go about it in dif-
fertent ways. So far,legislators have
been able to stave off attempts to
restore Individual Retirement Ac-
count deductions,which many
legislators want to keep. But the
House-Senate Committee which will
take up the measure is expected to
face fierce pressure to restore the IRA
deduction.

Judge says woman
has right to die

SOUTH TOMS RlVER,New Jersey --
A New Jersey judge ruled Tuesday
that a woman suffering from Lou
Gehrig's disease has a right to die.
But the judge immediately stayed his
order so the New Jersey Supreme
Court may review the decision.
Earlier, Kathleen Farrell asked the
judge that she be removed from the
life support system that keeps her
alive. Her family had brought her in
to the judge to show how much she
suffers. She has repeatedly asked doc-
tors to remove her from the life sup-
port system,but they have refused. In
a famous case during the 1970’s,the
New Jersey Supreme Court ruled it
was okay for relatives of comatose
Karen Ann Quinlan to remove her
from a respirator.

Ballooning: a real uplift  

David Zuchowski
Staff Writer
round 6 p.m. on a gorgeous Sun-
day evening, I arrived at Lynch
Field in Greensburg, eagerly
awaiting the scheduled 7 o'clock
liftoff for my first hot air balloon ride. Literally
hoping to cast my fate to the winds, I roamed
around the grounds for what seemed like an in-
terminable length of time looking for some sign
of activity. But alas, no balloon, no wicker gon-
dola, not even a discarded sandbag to be seen.

Just as my hopes for an exciting aeronautical
adventure had been dashed to the ground, a
large van pulled up beside me and someone
asked if I intended to take a balloon ride.
Gleefully responding in the affirmative, I jumped
inside. Once inside I was greeted by John Ad-
dison of American Aerial Promotions, his lovely
wife and four young ground crewmen.

After we drove to the nearby liftoff point, the
youthful crew singlemindedly began the
laborious task of unravelling and inspecting the
long ribbon that eventually, after being partially
inflated by a huge fan, proved to be the the five-
story, fireproof nylon balloon envelope.

After attaching the balloon to the wicker riding
basket, Captain John fired up the propane jets
with a deafening roar. He then ambled into the
basket, dwarfed by the multicolored, gigantic
bubble. I, choked with emotion, climbed aboard,
noting that the basket had a vague resemblance
to the carts used during the French Revolution to
transport people to the guillotine. I hoped for a
better fate. Two other brave souls, fellow novices
Justine and Kevin Mawe, jumped in behind me.
Kevin, it seems, had the romantic notion of tak-
ing his wife as a college graduation present.

Jets ablaze, we slowly shed our umbilical to
the earth and gently began our ascent. Skimming
inches above the tree tops, we could see the
dome of the county courthouse glimmering in
the sunlight. Looking straight down we could see
groups of suburbanites waving and gesturing
skyward, taking time away from their barbecues
and other Sunday leisures to greet our airborne

adventure.

Meanwhile, Captain John fired the propane jets
into the guts of the balloon, and we began our
ascent to 2000 feet. I clung with white knuckles

_to the rope connecting balloon and basket, look-

ing out on a 50-mile vista with awe and trepida-
tion. At this altitude we could see the valley ly-
ing between the Chestnut and Laurel Ridges of
the local mountain range and, in the opposite ~
direction, almost as far as downtown Pittsburgh.
The_view was ecstatic, the tranquility profound.
Our captain proved to be quite a character,

something right out of Dicken’s Pickwick Papers.
Captain John is a stocky ruddy Englishman, terse-
ly answering our questions with a thick British
accent while clenching a thin cigar between his
teeth. The owner of five balloons in all (ours was
one of the smallest), Jack Addison makes his liv-
ing. doing balloon excursions, aerial ‘promotions,
commercials, films or anything involving hot air
balloons. He also enters about five balloon races
each year, most recently winning the Balloon
Preakness in"Baltimore. You might have seen him

. manning the ” Evening Magazine” sponsored

balloon in last year's Three Rivers Regatta
Balloon Race. He won: that one too. The whole
time, he sat perched precariously on the edge of
the basket, feet dangling inside, barely holding
on, completely oblivious to any danger '
whatsoever.

As we gently descended to the ground, I kept
in mind the confidence building statement in the
promotional brochure. It stated that if perchance
the balloon should run out of fuel, it would des-
cend at parachute speed, and that a balloon is
the only aircraft that can go up faster than it can
come down. Still, it was a comforting feeling to
step back on firm ground again, greeted by our
smiling crew and a bottle of chilled champagne.

People's Oakland

continued from page I

The People's Oakland soon became
an advocacy group for the former pa-
tients, advising them of their rights as
individuals when it came to matters
of housing and job opportunities.

The agency soon expanded its in-
volvement with the mentally dis-
abled. In 1973 the organization
began to have Tuesday night
meetings with former patients to find
out how they were adjusting to the
community. Cook said the Tuesday
night meetings remain an important
function for People's Oakland
because it keeps its members aware
of the latest activities that occur
within the group and the
neighborhood.

Since the mid '70s, People's
Oakland has expanded its programs

”PeopIe’s Oakland
gives people a chance to
lead a semblance of a
normal life. We just want
a chance —— that’s what
People's Oakland has
given me.”

— Ron Gibson
vocational assistant

so it can better facilitate the needs of
the mentally disadvantaged. Pro-
grams on health and vocational train-

ing as well as discussions on current
events take place on a weekly basis.
Members and staff also meet weekly
to discuss the future and the goals of
new and existing programs. 1

The programs for Peop|e’s Oakland
have expanded, but the money for
them has not. The agency receives
funding from many sources, primarily
the Allegheny County Department of
Mental Health, the State Department
of Community Affairs and the Office
of Vocational Rehabilitation.

Cook said the money is still not
enough. ”Funding has been my big-
gest problem ever since I have been
here, and it still is.”

Cook explained that the Office of
Vocational Rehabilitation is having a
severe financial crisis of its own, and
that is affecting other vocational
rehabilitation agencies. ”It’s been
uncertain from January until now’
how their crisis is going to affect us,”
she said.

The vocational training that pa-
tients receive enables them to re-
enter the workforce, allowing them
to pursue various part—time jobs. Gib-
son said this is critical to enhance the
self-esteem of the patients. .

”The People's Oakland gives peo-
ple a chance to lead a semblance of
a normal life,” he said. ”We [mental-
patients] are not evil. An illness does
not make us evil. We justwant a
chance. That's what People's
Oakland has given me.”

TV Senate

Ronald Wilson Reagan is often called ”the great
communicator” for his facile use of modern televi-
sion technology. Mr. Reagan is the most famous actor-

turned-politician. And he is the only actor—turned—

president. But as of June 2, he was not the only ac-
tor/politician in Washington. One hundred senators
have just entered the ratings race. Now America's

W viewing public has the option to bring the Senate pro-

ceedings into its collective living room as easily as
it brings in ”The Cosby Show.” Reagan seems pleased
at this notion, though. When asked about having the
Senate on TV, he remarked, ”Oh, it's probably go-
ing to beat the ‘Wheel of Fortune/” A

One might think that these gentlemen would be
unaffected by the hype of lights, ‘camera and action.
But to see these lawmakers on the screen, you would
think that they were television veterans. They preen
and primp, they dress for success and then they
deliver. their speeches in the spirit of classic political
oratory.

Initial reactions were rather mixed. One morning‘
”Senate TV” held 24 special-order speeches, which
are televised addresses delivered outside of the
Senate's formal session. There are usually four or five.
Senators began to use visual aids and more hand and
body gestures. They also began to wear red ties and
blue suits, which are more flattering on camera.

As usual there was a mixed reaction among the
senators themselves. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole stated, ”lf members play to the cameras with
gimmicks, filibusters and endless speeches, then we
have failed.” On the other side, Minority Leader
Robert Byrd said, ”They (the Senators) are using more
oratorical flourishes and, over all, the debate has im-

Whether or not the viewing public is seeing a
realistic picture of the Senate, the fact that we are able
to see any picture is a move in the right direction.
No longer can ‘we say that 1 what goes on in
Washington is out of our hands. Senatorial staffs are
now informing local stations to cover important floor
speeches given by their representative.

Next time you have nothing to do, flip to C-SPAN

week, the Senate will probably be debating por-
nography or some other spicy topic. _ ‘

Morals don't work

Cecile Hecker, in trying to keep
birth control clinics out of the Pitts-

‘ burgh school system, demonstrates

an ignorance concerning teen-age
sex and pregnancy. For all her word-
iness and research, she has shown
me in her column on June 18 that she
simply doesn't know what she's talk-
ing about.

Let's get something straight now:
To place blame on Planned Parent-
hood or other organizations for this
tragedy misses the point that those
who support the clinics’ presence
recognize that teens will have sex
whether we want them to or not.

Letters to the Editor

Mind you, I'm no fan of fornication
or abortion, but I have learned that
the idea that students will abstain
from having sex if not provided con-
traceptives is just plain stupid.

I remember particularly 11 years
ago in junior high, not a public but
a private, religious-affiliated (I won't
mention the denomination) school,
«where sex was discussed freely and
practiced often among my class-
mates; there were even rumors about
orgies. Now we are talking about
12-, 13- and 14-year-olds [having sex]
on a regular basis with strong disap-
proval from the authorities. And I
don't believe that this is an isolated
situation. At the age of 25, I still

 
 

remember what it's like to be a
teen-ager.

I have met Mrs. Hecker, and I
know she stands for strong moral
values. So do I. However, moral
values in, of and by themselves are
useless; there must be a purpose
behind them. Maybe if our children
were given a purpose in life, there
would be no need for Planned
Parenthood or birth control clinics in
the schools — or anywhere else -

because our children wouldn't be .

Coke: It's the real thing

The world of professional basket-
ball, indeed the entire country, went
into a state of shock last Thursday.
Len Bias, perhaps the most promis-
ing college basketball player in the
history of the game, was dead.

Bias, a recent graduate of the
University of Maryland, the second
man picked in this year's NBA draft,
and First Team All-America, suffered
a heart attack just two days after sign-
ing with the Boston Celtics. The fact
that a 22-year-old athlete would die
from cardiac arrest raised a few
eyebrows. He had passed numerous

_ and thorough physicals for both the

university and the NBA. Any
previous heart condition would have
been detected. The press decided
that it needed some answers. They
found them. .

Soon after the country learned of
his death, The Washington Post
published a story claiming that co-
caine had been found in Bias’ urine.
There had been no official word on
the existence of cocaine in his body
to date, but on Monday night, ”CBS
Evening News" showed a segment
claiming that cocaine had been
found by police in Bias’ car. The seg-
ment also alleged that his teammates
had thrown away his drug parapher-
nalia before the police arrived at the
scene. No one knows if cocaine is
responsible for his death, but the idea
makes sense. Maybe he did have a
weak heart and the drug was too

" much for his system to handle. There

might have been something in theccr
caine. Perhaps he was mixing it with
some other substances himself. Who
knows? I really don't care to know

the particulars, but I'm sure Dan
Rather will be force feeding it to me
for the next three months. 0 g

If nothing else, Bias’ death raises
some serious questions about the
drug of the '80s. It's a long distance
from South America to the United

States, and anyone who believes the’

cocaine bought from friendly
neighborhood drug dealers isn’t cut
with God knows what is a fool in
every sense of the word. The drug is
dangerous enough without rat poison
in it.

I'm not naive, nor_am I innocent.
Cocaine use is rising steadily in this
country. It's no longer reserved for
the well-to-do. lt’s snowing
everywhere from boardrooms to
classrooms. It's the cool drug to take.
It doesn't impair a user's judgement
(too much), its effects don't last too
long, and it's more expensive than
marijuana, therefore a great way to
impress peers. It's like wearing a
Gucci watch instead of a Timex.

Cocaine use is a status symbol
because of the same media which try
to drive home the point that it is
dangerous. Almost every news pro-
gram contains a story that covers the
rising rates of cocaine use and addic-
tion. Messages that are meant to deter
the public from experimenting with
the drug are telling us that everyone
is doing it.

If a news program is going to run
a story on the dangers of cocaine,
does it really have to show a film of
somebody snorting a line? Is it really

necessary to show the regal lifestyles
of the people who import it-on every
episode of ”Miami Vice?” People's
attempts at telliing the world that co-
caine use is a dead-end street sadly
sadly end up glorifying it.

it's a terrible shame that Bias died
before realizing his full potential as
an athlete. His death need not be in
vain, however. It can be a lesson for

those who brush off the dangers.
associated with the drug. It is not safe, .

but then again, what recreational
drug is?

So think before you put anything
into your body. Where has this been?
What's in it? Isa 15- to 20-minute
headrush and a numb mouth worth
the risk of illness, addiction, or an
early grave?

Editor's note: It was determined
yesterday that the death of Maryland
basketball star Len Bias was definitely
linked to cocaine. The autopsy report
comes one day after state’s‘attorney
Arthur Marshall said he would con-
vene a grand jury investigation. He
said the person responsible for sup-
plying the drug could be charged
with manslaughter.

Bias’ death was indeed tragic. He
had everything ahead of him —
money, fame, and a great career.
Over 1,000 people came to his
funeral. These were friends and
others who cared about him. What
could be more bitter than to dwell
on Bias’ death? To those who claim
that an investigation will set a prece-
dentvfor others, I think not. Let the
man rest.

Nuclear annihilation is no laughing matter

Bruce Kasrel
For The Pitt News

As with the beginning of every
summer, the movie industry puts on
display its biggest box office guns.
The first batch, Top Gun, Cobra and
Raw Deal, were all violent in nature
but relatively harmless to the throngs
of pre-teens ‘flooding movie houses.
But with the recent release of The
Manhattan Project, parents will be
alarmed at this movie's total lack of
morality. In fact, The Manhattan Pro-
ject is so potentially dangerous that

the movie poster should be required

to post the message: Warning: The
Surgeon General has determined that
watching this movie will cause a total
loss of social conscience.

How can a movie, just a simple lit-
tle movie, be so dangerous you ask?
Well, Manhattan becomes deadly
when it handles the concept of a
teen-age boy who constructs a
nuclear bomb and totes it around
downtown New York with an at-
titude of, ”So what if I make a two-
mile crater where Manhattan used to

be?” In the classics Dr. Strangelove

and Fail Safe, both movies dealt with
the idea of total annihilation very
delicately. Here the idea is presented
in such a simplistic manner that this
movie is little more than a standard
teen-age flick premise where losing
virginity is replaced by entrance in-
to the nuclear club.

When 17-year-old Paul Stephens’
(Christopher Collet) divorced mother
introduces her latest romantic flame
to him, Paul is not the least bit im-

pressed. The stuttering John
Mathewson (John Lithgow), in an ef-
fort to impress the kid, reveals that
he is a scientist at the local lab. Paul
becomes interested. When he
discovers that the pharmaceutical
plant is really manufacturing
plutonium and that his mom's date

truck, the studio can get a few extra
bucks for the budget. Hey, if you're
going to make a movie with no
morals why not go all the way?
After he obtains the key ingredient,
Paul can think only of constructing
his little toy. Going to the local Ser-
viStar and his high school science

is really a nuclear authority, his in-

terest level jumps off the scale.

The young genius decides that it

would be a real challenge to steal

some of the deadly substance and

make his own atomic device. With

alittle help from his girlfriend Jenny
(Cynthia Nixon), Paul manages to get

a bottle out of the heavily guarded

building. The scheme is highly inven-
tive and entertaining, but upon closer

inspection it appears to be just a
cleverly disguised video catalogue for
the toy manufacturers. With a close
up on the Whamo Frisbee and the
remote-controlled Suburu, miniture

This light musical comedy, set in

and dance. The story centers around
Ruby, a new arrival to the big Apple,

accoutrements to finish the job.
Director Marshall Brickman, who
also co-wrote and co-produced the
movie, films the scenes with a
realistic and honest viewpoint. The
frightening thing that comes to one’s
head while watching the assembly
process is that this is not fiction. But
the movie’s insightful posture is soon
lost in a sea of movie—making stunts.

From the very beginning, Paul is

doing all this not to impress a pretty

girl, but rather to prove to himself that
he can do it. Now what do you do

With piano and percussion accom-

paniment, Dames at Sea works well

deteriorates somewhat in the solo

seem to be the problem, but the cast
has such a great time performing its
role and the fun is so contagious that
the audience ends up enjoying itself

a high school science fair of course.

After a series of chases, the
resourceful teen-agers get away from
the military types who are quite wor-
ried about the consequences of a
possible disaster. In fact, these bad-
guy Pentagon people seem to be the
only ones who appear to care about
the safety of the civilians. Paul's hav-
ing a ball, and his scientist buddy is
having -second thoughts about his
career choice.

Looking at The Manhattan Project
as just movie, the performances of all

concerned are adequate and

Brickman’s directionis highly polish-
ed. Even the dialogue is smooth and
natural. But with this movie, it's not
how it's presented, it's what is
presented. And what is presented is
a shocking piece about the lack of
responsibility from our teen-age
ranks. This movie is so alarming that
when Paul discovers that his bomb
has a hundred times the destructive
power he originally calculated, he is
almost impressed. What started out
as a science project turns into a social
statement, but God forbid he should
ever realize that this cute little device
could wipe out half the Northeast. In

short, this movie's moral reasoning 

power is nonexistent.

Hey, why not‘ build a bomb
w-ithout the plutonium? Nah, that

wouldn't be as destructive. And on -

the same line, why not make a movie
with a little sense of right and wrong?
Nah, that wouldn't be as profitable.

Running The Show

This captivating one-act play has
many plot twists and surprises, but
Patricia Stack, in the lead as Sally,

puts the audience at ease.

ph0ne:468_5O50 As the plot develops, Sally's

just a small-town girl from Center-
ville, Utah, with big ideas of becom-
ing a star on Broadway. After landing
a job as a dancer in the chorus line

of a Broadway musical, Ruby pro-

chicanery to disguise her identity and
to pass her off as Jewish begins. Rose
Marie Murphy assumes the name
Rosie Murofsky to fool Papa Levy and
the deception succeeds only until

with the entrance of other characters
who contradict her reality. Sound
complicated? It's only the beginning.

is when Rose's dad, a surly, hot-

Father Whalen arrive to attend the
marriage, but both are kept in the
dark about Abie’s background. When
Papa Murphy meets Papa Levy, the
disguised farce ends and the hilarity
begins. This light and entertaining
spoof highlights the nature of pre-
judice and the ethnic chauvinism of
the early 20th century and shows
how far 5,", pe_r_ha_ps, how little we

have come to eradicate our social-

biases since then. This well—acted and

This play delves into the often

The play is sometimes confusing
because the men relay through

if the arguments are taking place in
the past or present, but this adds to
the humor and creativity of the play.

Subterraneans (and sedatives) fr

Chris Zurawsky
For the Pitt News

When the anxiety of giving direc-
tions to passing motorists on the
avenues of Squirrel Hill becomes too
much to bear, I take the Parkway sure
fire cure and head out of town. My
most recent sedative afforded me a
first-hand look at the Akron, Ohio,
metropolitan area and its once-
famous music scene.

A few Fridays, ago, I entered the

search of a stray bullet-hole from the

‘ rifle of a National Guardsman and the ‘
much heralded Portage Lakes resort

and music club known as J.B.’s. If
nothing else, this joint is the first that
ever made me appreciate the
carpeted walls and red lit, infernal
splendor of the Electric Banana.
J.B.’s Upstairs didn't look so bad,
but it featured a rock ’n’ roll cover
band doing their 99th version of
”Born to be Wild,” which is a great
song for the first 98 times-or if you're

in the market for a sporty sedan. On
the other hand, J.B.’s Down and three
local, original music groups were in
the midst of hosting a benefit for
hunger in memory of a recently
deceased scene denizen, a sort of
Hands-Across-Interstate. 76. A big
crowd of friends filled the dance
floor, and they must have come for
the bands and the canned goods
because J.B.’s basement was like a
sauna in a Port-a-John. Sure it could
have been the weather, but a club

om south of

town of Kent, just east of Akron, in
 without a grafitti encrusted men's
room is suspect to say the least, and
the beer bottles were dusty to top it
off. '
As most rock historians and new
wavers can tell you, this particular
- O ~ _ area. of north—east Ohio was the
 .  I O  '0 spawning ground of such pop
.. . culturalists as Devo, the Waitresses,
the Pretenders, and other innovative,
or at least initiallly interesting, recor-
ding artists. In 1986 however, little
of this imagination and creative im-
petus exists in the land just south of
Sea World. The surprises have been
supplanted by a strict adherence to
guitar-oriented pop ethics and the

beat on the two and four. Tlhilskind
of song crafting isn't damnable per se,

but it does require a talented hand to I

save the style from becoming a
crushing bore.

My night on J.B.’s mountain un-
covered a band called the Subterra-
neans who are currently one of the
sharpest purveyors of the Akron
sound. With a diverse set of hard-
edged, rumbling, original tunes, not
to mention a cool cover of Echo and
the Bunnymens ”Do it Clean,”this
combo has covered the ground from
Cleveland to Youngstown since Oc-
tober of '84 with their own brand of
high yield pop plant nutrients.

With a four-song cassette released
six months ago, Rob Johnston, Jim
Millar, Linda Harrison, (three former
Sacred Guns) and Dave Materna of
the Clinic, are now prepared to ply
their conscientious musical wares on
a grander scale, and, like their press
kit says, ”Subterraneans rise from
area depths.”

The Subterraneans will be appear-
ing with WildKingdom this Saturday
night at the Electric Banana.

Quality is not a lost commodity in film

Douglas Payne
For The Pitt News

Summertime can be pofitable yet
trying at the box office. We, as
viewers, are hardly concerned as to
whether film companies rake in
millions or break even. I, for one, am
worried that Top Gun or, worse yet,
Cobra will be fondly remembered as
the big summer smash of '86. Cer-
tainly these companies, which so ob-
viously cater to the MTV-oriented
teen-ager, leave us with little or no
choice but third-rate thrillers in first-
run theaters. Fortunately, there is the
Pittsburgh Playhouse on Craft
Avenue for the film—goer who is look-
ing for something as bizarre as
substance and as old—fashioned as
quality.

This week the Playhouse offers its
usual oasis of classics and modern
favorites to spice up your summer
nights. Tonight Some Like it Hot
returns with the amazing combina-
tion of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis
and Jack Lemmon. Billy Wilder's
legendary comic romp is intended to
inject humor —— often successfully -

into the gangster genre by having -

Lemmon and Curtis witness the St.
Valentine's Day massacre. Fleeing to
Miami, they must disguise
themselves as women and travel with
a female group fronted by Marilyn
Monroe.

On The Waterfront, the Thursday
night movie, is a classic film by Elia
Kazan that boasts the immortal scene
in which Marlon Brando, constantly
down on his luck, says emphathica|—
ly, ”| coulda been a contender.”
Kazan, whose films include the stun-
ning A Streetcar Named Desire and
the wicked A Face in the Crowd, was

highly regarded as a director and

was, perhaps, to the 19505 what
Steven Speilberg or Lawrence Kasden
is to the '80s. The story maintains its
realism and stark simplicity with the
beauty of Marlon Brando's perfor-
mance while transcending time. Karl
Malden gives one of his best perfor-

mances here as the Pastor who at-‘

tempts, in vain, to improve the lives
of the dockside workers, and Eva
Marie Saint does a credible job as
Brando's paramour.

’ Throughout his career, Brandohas

remained the archetypical male

screen legend, but it's hard to im-

agine Woody Allen as anything larger

than the short New York intellectual
who shoots off witticisms stuffed with

enough realism to touch your funny
bone and your heart. I have always
cherished his cinematic gems. Han-
nah and Her Sisters (which shows at
the Playhouse on July 12) easily rivals
Brazil for the title of best film.

However, before Hannah, Annie
Hall and Manhattan (Friday night's

double bill) divided the opinion of
Allen's audience as to which film is

better. Some find Annie Hall brilliant
in its mixture of comedy and drama,

and original, often Freudian, sense of
flashback. Showcasing Allen's kinetic

prowess as a writer, actor and direc-
tor, Annie Hall spotlights one of
Keaton’s weirder roles. The film's on-
ly flaw is its weighty depiction of
reality.

Manhattan remains a favorite for its
devotion to realism and its dramatic
flair. it is with this film that Allen first
successfully explored the Bergman-
ian ”film is art” instinct while giving

“The Pitt News, June 25, 1986

20'.

Bob Travers
Sports Editor

It will be more difficult to find the
Panthers on television this fall. With
the exception of two or three home
games this season, the only way to
see the Panthers in action will be to
make the walk up DeSoto Street to
see them in person. And that's just
what Pitt officials hope happens.

”We’ve not totally eliminated
overexposure for this season,” said
Dean Billick, Pitt's acting athletic
director. “But we are working in that
direction." ‘

It seemed that last season Pitt was
on television more often than
M*A*S*H reruns. Every game was
telecast in one way or another, and
Pitt officials partly blame that on poor
attendance at Pitt Stadium. They
believe that with the choice of ven-

Sports    

TV deal to limit Pitt's overexposure

turing into Oakland to see a game in
person or staying home to watch it
on television, many people opted for
the Sony. That won't happen this
year, Billick promised.

”We’re beginning to find the prop-
er balance between enough exposure
for our football team and having too
many home games telecast, which
hurts our live gate,” he said. This
season Pitt will allow only two,
possibly three, home games to be
televised.

After a quick look at the 1986 Pitt
schedule, it's not hard to figure out
which games those will be. The
opener, a night game with Maryland,
will be televised nationally by ESPN,
and the West Virginia game will be
picked up by Pitt's television syn-
dicator, Television Enterprise Net-
work. This company also syndicates
games for schools such as Syracuse

and Notre Dame. TEN may also
broadcast the Miami game if at least
45,000 tickets are sold the week
before the game. The home games
not to be televised are with Temple,
Navy and Rutgers.

”The problem,” Billick said, ”is not
with national telecasts, specifically
games carried by ESPN, ABC or CBS,
but with the syndicated networks.”

There are dozens of networks
across the country lining up colleges
and universities to get the rights to
syndicate their teams’ games to in-
dividual stations. In return, the syn-
dicator pays the university a fee. In
Pittsburgh it works like this: Pitt signs
a contract with TEN allowing it to
broadcast as many Pitt games as the
contract calls for. TEN pays Pitt for
those television rights, and then sells
the games to WTAE, which broad-
casts the games to the Pittsburgh

alma mater.

Off-sea work brings—New York Je Jim Sweeney back to his

Sweeney Remembers:
Former Pitt great relives Glory Days

By Greg Evanina

For The Pitt News

Take a casual stroll through the
weight room of the football complex
at the University of Pittsburgh and
step back into the past. As you look
around, you see the standard weight
room fare - free weights, guys pum-
ping iron, benches and mirrors.
Above the weights hangs a number
of signs on the walls. Fiesta Bowl
1973. Sugar Bowl 1976. National
Championship 1976. Gator Bowl
1977. Tangerine Bowl 1978. Fiesta
Bowl 1979. Gator Bowl 1980. Sugar
Bowl 1982. Cotton Bowl 1983. Fiesta
Bowl 1984.

Those signs serve as a reminder of
the Pitt Panthers of old to the Pitt Pan-
thers of today. They give the team
something for which they can strive
- the winning tradition.

The bowl signs are, however, on-

ly silent reminders. They can't tell the
players of the amount of work that it
took to get into those championship
games. They can't convey the emo-
tions involved or the teams’ ex-
periences. The signs can't say what
has been learned along the way. Nor
can they relay any helpful anecdotes,
either. As a matter of fact, the signs
can't say anything. They can only
silently and subconsciously remind.

Those same signs remind Jim
Sweeney of those bygone years as he
worked out beneath them each day
this past spring and summer. But for
Sweeney, rather than the current cast
of Panthers, the signs carry an entirely
different connotation.

They represent not the promise of
the future, but the glory of the past.
For Jim Sweeney, former offensive
linemen at the University of Pitt-
sburgh who was preparing for his
third year with the New York Jets of
the National Football League, feels

comfortable in these familiar surroun-
dings. During his four years at Pitt
(1980-84); Sweeney came to be
regarded as one of the premier center
in the history of the university.

Unlike his days at Pitt, he is no
longer a center but a tackle, after hav-
ing been switched from last year's
position at offensive guard. But for
Sweeney, summer is the off season
and he does not have to worry about
playing ball every Sunday.

”Off,” in this case, however, does
not mean taking it easy. It means
coming home to Pittsburgh,
specifically to his old neighborhood
of Beechview. And to Pitt, where he
diligently and singlemindedly works
out daily.

The 24-year old Sweeney was join-
ed several days a week during the off-
season by former Pitt players now in
the pro ranks, including Tommy

Flynn of the Green Bay Packers; two

viewing area. Penn State has a similar
contract with TCS, and several
universities in the Midwest are tied
into a deal with a syndicator called
RayCom. In the South the MizLou
network carries games.

It all seemed so simple a few years
ago, but a lawsuit by the universities
of Georgia and Oklahoma opened
the doors to deregulation of televised
college football. Before the suit, ABC
had exclusive rights to all regular
season college football games. In
1983, CBS, after a 20-year absence
from televising college games, began
broadcasting them. NBC was limited
to televising the Rose Bowl, the
Orange Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl.
Before 1984, the first year of
deregulation, the not-yet-viable
ESPN, was allowed to cover only
Division I-AA and the like. All net-

"Page 9

work contracts were negotiated with
the NCAA.

Oklahoma and Georgia, feeling
cheated by an NCAA regulation
limiting schools to three national
television appearances in two years,
formed the College Football Associa-
tion. Sixty-two football powerhouses,
including Pitt and Penn State but not
the Big 10, comprise CFA.

Oklahoma and Georgia, with the
support of most of the member
schools in the CFA, filed suit against
the NCAA. They claimed that the
NCAA had an illegal monopoly over
each school's television rights, and
that each schoolshould be allowed
to negotiate its own television con-
tract. The CFA won the suit and thus
the present chaotic situation.

Some schools such as Pitt have

’’I hate quarterbacks”

Rob Seitzinger
For The Pitt News 1

Tony Siragusa does not lead you on
in any way. He is straight-forward,
blunt and brutally honest. Thus, the
University of Pittsburgh sophomore
defensive tackle does not hide his
feelings about his dislike for
quarterbacks.

”I hate quarterbacks,” Siragusa
said. ”lt's that simple. I don't like
quarterbacks, ‘I don't hang out with
quarterbacks, and I don't talk to
quarterbacks.”

But Siragusa, who graduated from
David Brearly Regional High School
in 1984, does admit to conversing
with quarterbacks on his own team.

”Dan Marino was in the weight
room the other day, and I talked with
him,” Siragusa said. ’’And I'll talk to
our own quarterbacks  but I'd rather
congratulate the offensive line after
a nice play than the quarterback.”

Siragusa said that his scorn for the
quarterback began when he first saw.

Next Sunday, over three billion
people will be watching the cham-
pionship game of the largest sporting
event in the world — Mundial '86,
the World Cup Soccer Tournament.

This quadrennial event, held this
year in Mexico City, is the culmina-
tion of three years of qualification
rounds and 51 games of world-class
soccer. Since only 24 teams earned
a berth in the 1986 World Cup, just
qualifying is an honor accorded on-
ly to the very few.

In the first round, there were few
surprises, although. pre-tournament
underdogs Morocco and the Soviet
Union each played well and qualified

.for the second round, while soccer

powers Brazil, France and Italy, the
defending champion, made the se-
cond round despite unspectacular
performances. .

Perhaps the most anticipated mat-
ches of this year's tournament oc-
cured in the quarter-final round. It
was then that France squared off with
favorite Brazil, and England met
Argentina. France beat Brazil only
after a heart-stopping overtime
shootout which the French won 4-3.
Argentina, led by dynamo Diego
Maradona, downed Britain, advanc-
ing to the semi-finals.

In other sports news, Bo Jackson
shocked the Tampa Bay Bucaneers
by annourfcing Saturday that he will
refuse the Bucs live-year $7 million

Joe Namath. ”He was acting like he
was so cool and like he was the most
important person in the world. God,
he made me angry.”

Angry is something you don't want
this 6-5, 260-pound monstrosity to
be, a fact to which Pitt's defensive
line coach Carl Angelo will attest.

”He has the ability to dominate an
opponent and the line of scrim-
mage," Angelo said. ”He’s getting
bigger and stronger this summer. Of-
fenses that used to worry about
[defensive end] Tony Woods are now
going to have to worry about Tony
Siragusa also.”

Last season Siragusa’s role at Pitt
was limited —— the former New Jersey
state wrestling champion played in
just two games. But 1986 looks to be
a more promising year for. both
Siragusa and the Panthers as new

head coach Mike Gottfried has this
squad thinking big.

championship ring,” Siragusa said.

deal to sign with the Kansas City
Royals. Jackson, who starred in both
baseball and football at Auburn
University, won the Heisman Trophy

last fall, denoting him the best col- A

lege football player in America.
Jackson was the first player chosen in
the 1986 NFL draft, by the Bucaneers
who were prepared to make him the
highest paid rookie of all time.
Jackson did not play baseball for
Auburn this year because of a plane
ride he accepted from the Bucaneers.
That ride, NCAA officials said, was
a violation of Jackson's amateur
status, thus officials declared him in-
eligible to play for Auburn. It seems,
however, that it was the Bucs who
really got taken for a ride. The Royals
disclosed the terms of Jackson's con-
tract on Monday. It is worth slightly
more than $1 million over the next
five years. Should Jackson choose to
return to football, he would have to
repay the Royals a hefty chunk of his
$100,000 signing bonus. Jackson
said there is no chance of his return-
ing to the gridiron.

Another sports shockerlast week
was when University of Maryland
basketball star Len Bias died. Bias
reportedly died in a Marlyand dor-
mitory room early last Wednesday
morning. Original reports said that
Bias was the victim of a heart attack.
In an autopsy report released yester-
day, however, the official cause of
Bias’ death was listed as cocaine in-
toxication. The discovery of Bias’ use
of cocaine came as a shock to those

argued that too many television ap-
pearances have hurt attendance,
therefore they are renegotiating their
syndication deals. Pitt and TEN have
renegotiated for an undisclosed
amount of money per game.’ It is

A somewhat less, however, than the

quarter of a million dollars a school
can make from one nationally
televised game.

/‘We want the financial benefits
and the exposure of a national

game,” Billick said. ”We cannot
responsibly turn down a national
game.”

Billick also said that there will be
some changes in the format of the
weekly coach's show. ”Those types
of programs have fallen into the same
type of format all over the country,”
Billick noted, ”and we have found
that not many are watching them. So
what we are going to do with the
Mike Gottfried show this year is have
five specials rather than a weekly

show. There will be one pre-season
show, three during the season and
one post-season show. Perhaps we
can get some of them on during
prime time which will increase our
audience by five or six times.”

The issue of television rights for
college football teams is a complex
one. Next week the series continues
with an examination of how other
universities deal with television
rights, and what the networks
themselves think.

One person's

- While watching the NBC broadcast
of the Boston Red Sox-Baltimore
Orioles game last Saturday, I found
myself subject to yet another
tiresome disparagement of multipur-
pose stadiums by the game's an-
nouncers, Vin Scully and Joe
Garagiolla. I, along with millions of
others, learned that neither Scully nor
Garagiolla are fond of the new breed,
of which Three Rivers is a founding
member. They much prefer the Old
World charm of Fenway Park,

' Wrigley Field or Tiger Stadium to the

complex efficiency of Busch
Memorial Stadium, Veterans Stadium
or Three Rivers.

After extolling at length the virtues
of Fenway, the Polo Grounds, Forbes
Field, and other buildings that have
been reincarnated as parking garages
and condominiums, Scully and
Garagiolla said that the new stadiums
have little character and are staid con-
crete monoliths devoid of soul. OK,
so they didn't say it in those exact
words, but that is what they meant.

other Jets, Ron Sams and Troy Ben-
son; Bill Fralic of the Atlanta Falcons;
Emil Boures of the Pittsburgh Steelers;
and Danny Marino of the Miami
Dolphins.

’’I come here in the morning and
work out,” said Sweeney of his dai-
Iy routine. ’’I eat lunch with these
guys. I come back and work out and
then go home and watch The
Guiding. Light, The Munsters and
MASH. And then I run at night- when
it’s a little cooler.”

Sweeney's everyday schedule.

focuses on the place where he spent
four years of his career- Pitt. He goes
there- not because he has nowhere
else~to work out— but because he
simplywqould not have it any other
way.

I've had it with people knocking my

stadiums.

I call them that because they are

I the parks with which I have grown

up. Ebbet’s Field may as well" have
been a Roman coliseum for this col-
lege generation. We can no more
relate .to Sportsman's Park than we

r can to the Parthenon; we don't even

have memories of those places, just
stories.

Since I was five years old, Three
Rivers Stadium has been a second
home to me. When I walk its ramps
of silvery asphalt and gaze at the
huge green circle in the middle of it
all, I don't see seams in the carpet
and cracks in the concrete but the
ghosts of Willie Stargell, Terry Brad-
shaw and a generation of other
heroes. I hear the echoes of an-
nouncer Art McKennan, in a voice
clear as a lake at sunrise, informing
us that, ”At bat, number 21, Ro-ber-
to Cle-men-te!” and the roar of the
crowd. I also hear music, faint but un-

just can't

He said, ’’I can't work out
anywhere but here. I don't have a

good workout unless I work here.” .

Sweeney pauses to point across the
room and says, ”You see that kid in
theblack? He's Shaun McGri|I. He's
been working with me fo;r two years.
He pushes my butt hard. If I'm late,
he calls my house and screams, ’Get
over here!’ ”. ,

Another person instrumental in
Sweeney's daily regimen at Pitt is the
weight training coach, Charles ”Bud-
dy” Morris. Morris has been helping

Sweeney train since his freshman .

year. Morris said, ”On day one, Jim
Sweeney was a little boy. In four
years, I watched a little boy become
a man." He hesitates, then quickly
adds: ”A pretty big man, too!”

But things weren't quite so easy for

mistakable. The thunder of Bruce
Springsteen and the joy of ”We Are
Family.”

But so much more happened at
Three Rivers Stadium during the 16
years I didn't see. Think of all the
stadium itself has witnessed. If the
walls. could talk 

It could tell us unbelievable stories
of triumph, like the two World Series
championships and the four Super
Bowl championships. The walls
could tell of a Christmas miracle, a
reception immaculate and perhaps
the greatest quarterback the game has
ever seen.

The playing field at Three Rivers
Stadium is the battlefield where John
Candeleria pitched the only no-hitter
by a Pirate in Pittsburgh this century,
where Clemente knocked his 3,000th
hit, where Franco Harris rushed for
the second most yardage in history.
The field has also been covered with
seats when another kind of history
was made there. The Rolling Stones,

forget his life as a

Sweeney at the beginning, says Mor-
ris. ”You know, jimmy wasn't the
strongest person in the world; his
body wasn't the most coordinated
and he wasn't the greatest athlete. But
what Sweeney had that so many
players lack nowadays is a lot of
courage. He was going to do
whatever it took to become one of
the best.”

Morris continues, ”That’s what
separates Sweeney from a lot of peo-
ple. He has developed tremendous
work habits. He does another set (of
exercises) over even when he doesn't
have to.” I

As evidenced by Morris’ testimony,
Sweeney obviously has a great deal
of character and demonstrates it both
on and off the field. But for Sweeney,
a man almost obsessed with

defense of Three Rivers Stadium

Bruce Springsteen, the Beach Boys
and Simon and Garfunkel have all
performed there.

I think the reason so many older
people cling to their notion that older
ballparks are better is because they
are what they grew up with. Younger

0 fans know about Garvey, Dodger

Stadium and the way the sun sets
over Chavez Ravine. They know how
John Mayberry and George Brett
have sent baseballs splashing into the
fountain beyond the wall at Royals
Stadium. They will tell you all you

want to know about Schmidt at the

Vet, Gooden at Shea and Ozzie
Smith at Busch.

It's all a matter of perspective.
There will come a day when my
children will lookat me with a stare
as empty as Hitler's heart as I tell
them of Three Rivers, the Vet,
Candlestick, Fulton County Stadium,
Riverfront and the rest.

”But,” they might ask, ” what
about the new PirateDome?”

overachievement, is there life beyond
football?

Sure is. Sweeney is currently com-
pleting his degree in administration

of justice at Pitt. He needs only two»

more credits and anticipates getting

those out of the way within a few I

weeks.

He will soon have his degree. And
he already has a goodjob. So‘, what
is next for Jim Sweeney?

A world class swimmer named
Melanie Buddemeyer, who is from
Penn Hills and competes at the
University of North Carolina. The
happy couple are engaged, but have
not yet set a wedding date.

As you can see, everything in Jim

that it can be. Speaking of best, you
may have been wondering just what

it is that Jim Sweeney enjoys most
about playing football professionally.

Surprisingly enough, it's not the
money and it’s not the fame; it’s real-
ly not anything tangible at all. ”What

I like best about the pros,” ‘said .

Sweeney with a smile, ”-is that peo-
ple tell me I‘haven’t changed- I'm still
the same as I was in high school.”
Would he have done anything dif-
ferently or changed anything in his
career? ’’I wish my grandparents,”
said Sweeney, ”were alive to see me},
play. I'd give up the rest of my career’
just to have them see me play. It
would mean so much to them since
they were all big sports fans.”
Indeed. The boy from Beechview
has got to make anyone even remote-
Iy associated with him feel quite
proud. -
