  Community advocates

joint planning Vehicle

by MICHAEL SIMON -
C Night Editor
A proposal for a joint,Universi-
ty, city, community planning ve-
_hicle. advocated by People’s Oak-

1-‘land for nearly a year. was sub-

mitted Wednesday night at a
meeting attended by more than
100 people. .

The document calls for the "es-
tablishment of the Oakland De-
velopment, Inc. (ODI), a non-
profit corporation that would
strive to "improve Oakland as a
place to live and work for an eco-
nomically and racially diverse
population and to see that the bal-
ance between institutions. stu-
dents and long—term residents is
maintained."

Goals bf the 0131 include:

—“Review all existing and future
plans for Oakland to determine
their impact on the community.

' —Serve as a _joint planning body
to which new and existing plans
will be submitted b_v the vari-
ous institutions. agencies. and
organizations affecting the Oak-

land area. in order to arrive at _

plans which each group can ac-
cept. ODI will be concerned pri-
marily with plans dealing with

housing and land use. transpor- ‘

tation, physical facilities. and
recreational space. I

—Plan and implement specific de-
velopment projects concentrat-
ing on the housing field. '

——See that various ‘groups in Oak-
land are adequately ‘consulted
and their opinions expressed
when .the board considers a
plan.” '

 The board would consistof ap- 7

proximately 30 members. of
which a substantial amount would
be Oakland residents. The board
could approve a plan by a two-
thirds majority: other issues
would be decided by majority vote.

Because of the large number of
people present. the Peoples Oak-

land proposal could not be dis- "

cussed. However. Tom Hartnett.
' assistant to the president of Chat-
ham College. suggested that’ the
tentative structure of the propos-
ed planning board be used to have
’ a smaller group examine the do-
cument-thoroughly. -

University representative Bern-

 ard Kobosky, Vice Chancellor for
" "Public Affairs, declared

that
“Pitt gives its support to this do-
cument; we want to deal..effec-
tively with the community.”
Reading from a'memo given
him by Chancellor Wesley Posvar.
Kobosky reminded the group to
consider the ever-present trans-

portation problem. better street -

lighting. more bus shelters. and
the future role of churches and
other tax-exempt institutions in
Oakland.

Peoples Oakland representa-
tive Sandy Phillips said that "a
legally binding body would be good
but it is not necessary."

‘‘If we could have co-operation

between the involved groups, we -

_»_ could possibly accomplish more

1 than with a formal structure,”
. ’ she ‘said. , : '*~ "

—L. D.*Sauvage is no member of
the lost generation. but his poetry
may have become words without
music for\ the Sala__vation Army
Band. ‘

His family's‘ ‘eager generosity
may have ' pro‘ven heartbreaking
due to a filial blunder.

During the final week of De-
cember. three boxes had stood
upon the seat of Sauvages auto.
awaiting delivery to the Salva-
tion Army. With the boxes lay a
brief case containing the ..results '
of years of labor. soon to mis-
takenly fall to a similar fate.

Unwittingly. he donated the
brief case as well‘. A

The following weekend, an un-
suspecting Sauvage searched for
the brief case. His’son had been
-away for a fewtdays. Upon his re-
turn, Sauvage inquired whether he
had seen the'ca‘se." ‘ ’i _

/

The truth then was realized. S .

The case contained six years of
original poetry by Sauvage, as -
well as a 20 year collection of ani-
‘mal poetry gleaned ‘from various
sources. Sauvage intended to em-
ploy the latter “as a. point in a

t‘ story character I. was creating,”
he said. ~

The day of the mishap. Sauv-
age's wife had asked their son.
Kevin. to deliver the ‘prepared
donations to a Salvation Army box
on Frankstown Rd. in Penn Hills.

Tight job inarket, long linesplague seniors

by SUE HOENSTINE ‘

At 5 a.m. they began. Some elusive desire had beckoned them to
leave their beds. even before the sun mustered enough courage to face
another Monday morning.

By 8 am." they had become a line of bodies that snaked around the
second floor of Schenley Hall and down two flights of stairs. They yawn-
ed. moaned. and waited. They waited for a key to turn in the door of
room 219 and a chance to register for job interviews two weeks later.

The morning of Jan. 10 may be remembered by some Pitt seniors
as the first successful step to employment; But those who don‘t get a
job will be among the majority of qualified graduates wrangling with a
tight job market. .

According to Ernest S. Holmok, director of the University Place-
ment Service, the number of professional jobs began to diminish in the
fall of 1970. ‘

This squeeze has produced a 30 per cent reduction in the number
of companies sending interviewers to Pitt. And Holmok explained that
"a number of companies who used to send six or seven interviewers
now only send one. V

"It used_ to be when a student would walk in-we could usually find a
job for him."» Holmok continued. "Now I‘m not so sure."

Holmok attributed the current job squeeze to a-reduced industrial
force., - Z ' - ' " '

In describing the content and

He continued by assessing Viet-.

nam as “a war into which Ameri- , '

_ ca‘ did not stumble blindly.” In.

Sheehan’s opinion, the Pentagon‘ ~

Papers ‘indicate that- the United,‘

States involvement is the result

of decisions of a relatively small ' \

group of men acting without con-
sultation with either Congress or
the public. »

On the basis of these assump- 

tions. Sheehan accused the gov-

Constitution. The 15-day restrain- V

that they don‘t overhire. “ he noted.

\, The Placement director also emphasized that one employee may be“

jObS has also reduced the attrition rate from industry to nothing. 

“The work force is not-shifting. With less openings, those .who"'
would like to change jobs won’t take the risk of becoming unemployed.
And most businesses aren’t hiring new people,” Holmok said.

Holmok. however. had -words of encouragement for prospective
graduates about to withdraw from the job-seeking game.

"it's better than ever for women,“ he said. "And there is a job for

every person who works to get one.’

Although grades and draft numbers are important to employers,

Holmok emphasized that personality factors and career orientation are _

not overlooked.

“They tjob recruiters) come to campus specifically to find out
how you think and how you talk,” Holmok said. “If grades were the
only factor. why would companies send interviewers arour_1d.'?" -

Holmock advised liberal arts students to consider jobs with state

and federal, agenciesrwith banks, and_ with retailers. And he noted that;  if .

He described the eight months

detailed analysis of the material.
His motto in analyzing the papers
was "be fair to thematerial."
Clarifying his point. he explained
that it is more important to look
beyond the motives of the deci-
sion-makers and relate them to
other motives and issues. rather
than attacking the motives them-
selves.

‘He felt that his experiences as
a Viet Nam correspondent did not
tend to bias his writing, but it did
make him more acutely aware
of the po'ssibilit_y of bias.

‘.'If you have strong personal
opinions. you lean over backward
to be fair." he said. Objectivity
is unattainablef he said. but fair-

ness and accuracy are-possible

and desirable.

While talking to Sheehan. one
realizes that his recently acquired
fame has camouflaged his genuine
commitment to moral issues. _ ‘

He is particularly concerned
with maintaining the free pre.ss

. as_guaranteed by the first amend-

ment. Recent government at-
‘tempts to subpoena newsman and
forcing them into revealing their

' sources disgust Sheehan, who in-

terprets these as anjabridge ment
of the public’s right _to know by

_limiting the reporters resources.

He also views "no knock" and
"immunity provisions" as a hasty
and unconstitutional solution to
the problem of racketeering.

lent on the subject of his sources
for the Pentagon documents.

Due to a relaxation of the election rules. John Frye has had his
name placed on the SG presidential ballot after throwing his hat in the

ring late.‘ '
- A'rnie Steinberg. chairman 'of the Student Government Elections

I Committee-. explained that he refused to accept Fr_ve‘s petition when '.

it was handed in 10 minutes after the deadline. Frye. however, decided
to contest the decision before the committee (SGEC). '

According to Steinberg. Frye told the SGEC that he had been ar-
rested. jailed and subjected to what he termed blatant police brutality.

1)

As a result he had spent considerable time in court and was not A

’ able to complete his petition until the last minute.

The committee met and debated the question and decided, accord-
ing to Steinberg. "that there were extenuating circumstances beyond
our wildest imagination.“ He said though he regretted breaking the '
deadline rule he felt that it was "justified." .
Frye‘s addition boosts the number of presidential candidates to
five. «

Steinberg also revealed procedures for the campaign and Wednes-
day's election. .

A crew of poll watchers has been recruited and trained and will be
at the polls ,to.guard__against any infractions of the election code.

To avoid complications for students who have not been invoiced,
the permanent plastic identification card will beaccepted without the
validation  the poll watchers. Students need only produce e-vidence
of fulltime second term registration. "

Debates have been scheduledgat which all candidates for all offices I

will have a chance to speak and answer questions. , . ,. _
They will be held Monday at 12 noon in the Student Union Ballroom

‘I and Tuesday at 6 pm. in the Towers lobby.

Steinberg emphasized the strictness of the electioncode. adding I
that anyone who violated the code would have his name and the nature
of his infraction “posted at the polls. V ' ‘ -

"Dividing the group into small-

 Affirmative Action
progresses slowly

by GAIL HORNSTEIN

(Editor's Note: The following column represents the writer's personal
opinion and should not be construed as reflecting any other viewpoint.)

In view of the amount of publicity and activity relating to
affirmative action which has taken place in the university during
the last two years. it is important at some point‘ for those involv-
ed in this process to stand back and examine the movements pro-
gress objectively.

Although pressing problemsof discriminatory practices exert
an increasingly powerful force on the university,,it is my feeling
that unfortunately these challenges for the most part are not being
met. ' . ‘ ﬂ

There exist at this time a university report -and program of af-
firmative action. 'and reports on specific actions to be taken in the
student affairs area, the pro-vost area. the financial and planning

areas. and the health professions. Most of these reports-‘are now a

year old. Their implementation, however, is either in its very early
stages or nonexistent. ‘

Affirmative action within the university has been transformed°§"

from movement and change to report writing and meetings.
most of which are undirected and unproductive. - _
This general situationhas, of course, its exceptions. Recently
articulated policies inthe provost area concerning the hiring of
minority and women‘ faculty, if strongly_ implemented; will serve

as ‘an important step toward equal representation of these groups’

on the faculty. - *

The recently passed women’s studiesfprogram,- if n_ot held up i

in committee deliberations and" departmental quarrelling,

will
_effect significant change in undergraduate education. The large

number of programs, speakers, and institutes held during the last. '

year have contributed in a large way toward the raising of con-

sciousness’ to discrimination against women, and have provided .

impetus for numerous action programs.

Other situations are not~as promising. The Student Health
Service recently curtailed gynecological services despite a sharply
.inc'reased need. for them because of budgetary shortages. It is un-

fortunate that the institution of fees for service has been the solu-

tion to the problem of administrative overspending. This puts a
de_ci_ded'han'dicap on students whose expectation for free health
careis now unrealized. It is hoped that in the future Health
Service priorities will be adjudged to serve the needs of women

students, who comprise more than half -of the_ population regularly,

using theservices,inamoreeffectiveway. , _ ‘ 
Although questionnaires sent ‘to _all women faculty,_;, students,

and administrators, and a selection ‘or alumni and drop’-outs last,-f,,_.;_
year demonstrated clearly that there existed a pressing need for"

child care at ‘the university, administrative officials decided that *_

instead, of action, more study was needed.

' A new committee -is now repeating. the ‘earlier. studyleffortse

Another year is being spent, and women’s -career andeducational
options are not improving. Bureaucratic procedures in this and a
number of other cases have indicated that action, even. on pressing
issues,cannotoccurrapidly. ’ ‘ E » '

The‘ Advisory Council,“ on Women’s Clpportunities has spent

two years making recommendations for change in all areas of the

university. Many of ‘these have‘ never been seriously considered,'’‘' ‘‘

much less implemented.

‘In terms of a significant increase in the numbers of high level l

women faculty and administrators in real decision-making" posi-:..-

’ tions/the university has effected few noticeable changes.

It is my feeling that if the unii/ersity’s commitments to affir-
mative action are sincere, immediate; steps should be‘ taken to
change stated intentions to concrete «policy. Such efforts could
begin with the affirmative action plan itself, which outlines a

number of importantly needed improvements in faculty and em-_

ployee areas.

,In addition, such clearly discriminatory practices as not award-
ing compensation to women faculty and administrators for day

care expenses incurred while attending conferences or other uni- V

_ versity related activities should be ended immediately,, as should

the awarding of athletic scholarships only to male studentshand
the discriminatory admission policy of the interculturalhouse.

, We ., have passed thelpoint of consciousness raising. It is _no'
longer important whether-_,_administrators‘ and faculty believe that

discrimination against women and minorities is morally wrong. “ ~ \

It is illegal, and that isiwhlatimatters. ‘Both the policies and "
_the practices of the university must be’ in accordance with the

law. . * , ,
A recurring theme in discussions during thelpast two years has

centered around attitude change. It goes something like thi,s—-if _l

only people would understand their racist and sexist tendencies,

they would realize that they are wrong. and-change their behavior
accordingly. I believe, that this is an extremely ineffective way to

effect institutional change, and hardly ever works.  y _
Rather. the university should concentrate its efforts on chang-

ing policy. and increasing the numbers‘ of visible women ‘and-

minority decision-makers. Attitude change will follow in some 

cases. Whether or not it does is relatively unimportant 'if the uni-
versity is maintainihg illegal practices. ' ‘

. The newly .'created Office of Affirmative Action should
serve to centralize efforts for change, collect theyneeded informa-

tion,‘ and most importantly, create workable monitoring techniques
to insure progress. - ‘ "

As the‘ university is really only beginningyto establish’ the 

necessary communication systems to work toward implementation

of: its affirmative action plans, progress] to date had been.slight._ ’
It‘ is hopedgby those of us who: have been committed [to such V_

Organist excels in
spirited chapel recital

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Dr. Robert S. Lord. University
organist, presented his first organ
recital of the term this past week
in Heinz Chapel with a program
displaying his virtuosity

Traditionally. his programs
have featured works of Bach,
and this recital was no excep-
tion. Things got off to a joyous
start with the stirring Toccata in
F.

Lord’s sound technique was
apparent in many places but his
interpretation had its rough
spots as well. His pedalwork was
good although alien‘ sounds
occasionally crept into the music.
Two more modest choral pre-
ludes by Bach and Kirngerger
followed. 2 ~

Lord. who has been a pupil
of Jean Langlais for some years.
has taken a great interest in the
twentieth century school of
French organ composers. As a

works of Widor. Vierne. Dupre.
Tournamaire. and Langlais to
many of us here in Pittsburgh.

His final selection in this re-
cital was the allegro vivace from
the Fifth Symphony for Organ
by Widor.

This particular movement. cast
as a theme and variations.’ has
rhythms which are a delight for
the listener and a challenge for
the organist.

All were hungry for an encore
and Lord kindly obliged with
the final movement of the same
Widor symphony, the very
popular “Tocc-ata’.’

Festive in every respect. it
gives an impression of perpetual
motion. It does come to an end.
‘of course. but not before the per-
former has played an exhaustive
number of notes.

With the“Toccata” a wonder-
fully spirited recital came to a

fitting conclusion. Proper program-

ming and excellent selections
contributed to an enjoyable mu-
sical experience for all.

‘Cups and Candlelight...’

Campus coffee spots a taster’s choice

by WILLIAM M. SMITH

Last Friday this reporter don-
ned one genuine Left Bank
beret. one E.Z. Stick-On goatee.
one pair of opaque shades and
with snapping fingers plunged
into the Oakland night for a
Bohemian weekend.

Driven by a fanatic desire to
find out the meaning behind
all those yellow paper guitars
hanging everywhere around the
University. I headed first to-
ward Lothrop Street for opening
night at the Expresso.

The “Expresso”, located in the
east wing of MCNR, is. new
and is open every Friday night
this term from 8:30 p.m. ‘til
midnight.

Upon reaching the entrance
one must first deposit 25 cents
in the upside-down box lid on
the desk, an action and amount I
was told which entitles the
donor to a menu. so that he then
might become a diner.

Once inside it becomes evi-
dent that the Expresso meets all
the basic requirements of the col-
legiate conception of a coffee
house but fortunately doesn‘t
stop there.

The smoke—filled air is dimly
illumined by candles glowing
from empty wine bottles. In
keeping with the philosophy of
Karen McGuire. Head Resi-
dent and part time waitress.

11 As a result.

“You pay
nothing.“

nothing. you get

you are treated to a variety of
entertainment. Have your choice
of something to eat other than
bagels and doughnuts. and can
feast your eyes on the lovely
MCNR waitresses while wishing
the candleholders were full of
what their labels advertise-.

As with any opening night,
there was a series of unforeseen
mishaps. A saboteur had evi-
dently been at work somewhere
in the electrical system and
Elmer couldn’t be found to
right the wrong.

the coffee didn’t
make an appearance until
halfway through the evening and
the entertainers had to put up
with repeated microphone fail-
ure. ,

But these were small enough
problems, and as I said. a cer-
tain amount of hassles are to be
expected opening night.

The next night it was off to
scour the_quad for the obscure
entrance to the Fitzy Ritz
coffee house. By this time the
unique aroma of the percolating
bean was becoming quite fami-
liar so I nosed my way to a point
from where- I was certain I
could discern canned Leo Kottke
music emanating.

Upon entering I was immedi-

tsmtcoo
      otvvoss
 U§< OP  

ately struck by the obvious
similarities between this estab-
lishment and that of the night
before. Both have the same
lighting system—candl‘es, the same
air- smokey, and both main-
tain a good attendance.

There are certain marked dif-
ferences also.

Fitzy Ritz is smaller with a
dungeon-like atmosphere. making
it seem a bit more intimate.
There is no cover charge and
coffee is a dime. (15 cents at the
Expresso) although they seem
to run out of it fairly early in
the evening. There are no wait-
resses. but a cute little terrior
named Kasha can be seen and
felt running around the table legs
and your feet. It's a matter of
personal preference. folks.

The entertainment is
varied, perhaps leaning a bit
toward that pure, knee-slappin’
blue grass music which seems
to be experiencing a wide-
spread popularity.

again

Well. coffee is coffee and it is
someplace to go on a Friday or
Saturday night when your eyes
become bleary from a steady

stream of C.F. movies. —Oh.'

"It will be a rebuilding year for
us" is the statement made by
coaches year after year, every-
where. Two mentors who have re-
cently made this statement. War-
ren Neiger of Pitt and Steve Ban-
jak of Slippery Rock, will pit their
/gymnastic teams against each
other Saturday night at Slippery
Rock.

Coach Banjak has lost seven
members from his 1970-71 squad.
which posted an excellent 14-3
record. Among those gone from
last year’s team are Chuck Dun-
lap and Robert Scholl, both Lake
Erie Intercollegiate League
champions.

Banjak claims he has only six-

Rockets host gymnasts

returning lettermen who show
good potential. They are led by
captain Steve Heasley. a floor ex-

~ercise and vaulting specialist and
all-around man Ron Sopata. So-
pata is back for his senior year
after serving the last five years in
the Army.

Bob Wallender (rings, vaulting)
and Mark Biseli (side horse, par-
allel bars), both seniors, are be-
ing counted on heavily in the meet
for the Rockets.

'Slippery Rock shares a com-
mon problem with Pitt in their
ability to develop strong all-
around performers. They do have
one in Sopata. but their other two

-men, Bill Wright and Gary Per-
due are both young‘ and lack_ex-
perience.

Lang, Hyde spark ieers

eleven minutes while tempers
flared‘ on both benches. Early
in the period -Tom, Lang drew
a double minor for fighting in
an incident that saw defense-
man Fred Wilson ejected from
the game. .

Lang was being harrassed by
two Indiana skaters when Wil-
son entered the fight to even
things up. After order was re-
stored Wilson was ejected from
the game "for being the third
man into the fight." according
to the officials.

Indiana then took to the of-
fense scored a pair of power
play goals and the second peri-

. od ended in a 3-3 tie.

Pitt regained ' its momentum
early in the third period when
Rich Baginski took a pass from

c.

P

Dave Bahnson and’ firedit past
the Indiana goalie. Tom Lang
added his second goal * as he
stole an Indiana pass in front
of the net and surprised the
goalie with a quick shot.

Pitt will attempt to run its
league record to 4-0. Busses
leave for the game at 4 p.m.

_and these two victories were ac-

complished by a strong" showing
in vaulting and floor exercise.
Heasley and Sopata along with
junior Dennis Scuillo compete in
floor exercise.

Coach Neiger was displeased
with his squad’s poor attitude and
performance against Springfield
and said: “The poor showing of
my boys was mainly due to them
being out of condition, a result of
not practicing over the semester
break.”

Neiger, however. was very hap-
py with the individual perform-
ances of some of his squad, prais-
ing both Mike Gracik and Dick
Pribis for their all-around show-
ings. Joe .Gelormini was another
who received recognition from
Neiger. This was for his hard
work and steady progress on the
parallel bars.

,Mermen. kickoff tough

Steve Winings leading the way.
O‘Keeffe. a backstroke ace who
earned his All-American laurals
in the Eastern‘s last year in the
200-yard event timed in 1257.2.
swam in the 200-yard freestyle
against Colgate.

The senior co-captain poses as
an even bigger threat by holding
the Bucknell team records in the
200-yard backstroke. the 100. 200
and 500 yard freestyle and the 200-
yard individual medley with times
as good as any Pitt swimmer.

Winings on the other hand is a
specialist, swimming in only the
freestyle sprints and legs of the
relays. He has almost equalled
his All-American qualifying time
of 21.3 seconds in the‘50-yard free-
style already, only a couple weeks
into the season.

Bucknell Coach Richard Russel
is extremely proud of freshman
backstroker Roger Schwanhaus-
ser. a former YMCA national
champion. He captured first place
against Colgate with a good time
of2:07.4.

by STEVE WILLIAMS

A 41-day layoff from competi-
tion over Christmas vacation
might seem like a good thing to
most people. but the swimmers
don‘t share the same feeling in
light of' tomorrow's meet with
Bucknell in Lewisburg.

"It's been difficult to keep tun-
ed up over such a long span of
time." explained Coach Richard
Bradshaw. "But they (the swim-
mersi know that half of our sea-
son is contained in the next two
weeks. with three meets in the
next week alone."

During the Christmas break all
but four of the members of the
swim team stayed in Pittsburgh
and participated in long. grue-
some daily workouts and weight

' lifting sessions.

Bucknell will be hosting the
mermen fresh from their victory
over Delaware Thursday, raising
their record to 2-1, the only blem-

/ish being a loss to Army.

They swamped Colgate. 82-31.
with their two Collegiate All-

Americans peter Q’Keeffe and V Senior co—captain Bob Rasmus-

  two weeks at Bucknell

sen has been having a good year
in the 200-yard breaststroke. com-
ing up with the excellent time of
2:26.2.

Pitt on the other hand will be
going into the meet without the
services of freshman Mark Wal-
lace who broke two varsity rec-
ords in Pitt’s first meet with
Clarion State. Wallace will be out
with mononeuclosis until later in
the season. Wallace was a high
school All-American and has been
rapidly improving this year.

“The team has been thinking a
lot about this meet,” Bradshaw
commented. "They plan to go to
Bucknell in shape. They have been
swimming an average of 2.000
yards more during vacation than
they did during school. In the
time trials we had recently ev-
eryone was pretty close to their
best time." ' _

The whole attitude of this hard
working team can be summed up
in the words of freshman free-
styler Tom Smith who has been
going through these workouts.

"Ijust like to win."
