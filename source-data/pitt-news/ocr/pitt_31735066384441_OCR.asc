Thaw's Facade Undergoes Repairs

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
Emergency repairs to the facade
of Thaw Hall are being completed
this week to replace loose granite.

An engineer doing a weekly
inspection earlier \this month
discovered a piece of granite-
weighing about 1,000 pounds—had
slipped six inches from its original
place on the building’s front.
Scaffolding was immediately placed
under the granite and a subsequent
inspection was made.

The inspection showed the steel
and bolts holding the granite slabs
in place has corroded to various

points of deterioration. The slab
that had slipped six inches was
being held only by mortar, with the
steel and bolts supporting it having
corroded completely. After the
scaffolding was in place, the piece
fell onto the scaffolding.

‘ ‘If that piece would have fallen to
the roof below, it would have gone
straight through to the lecture halls
beneath it,” commented Bill Renk,
project supervisor for Pitt’s plant
services and building maintenance.

Though the temporary repair
work to the front of the building will
be ﬁnished this week, more
permanent repairs will be necessary
in the future, according to Renk.

I I Pitt Considers More
House Seats

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Pitt News Staff Writer

Architectural plans to add as many as 6,000 seats at Fitzgerald
Field House are under review by athletic director Cas Myslinski and
Chancellor Posvar, according to Pitt sports information director

Billick said no decision to undertake the project has been made.
He added that blueprints drawn ﬁve years ago currently are under
serious consideration for the ﬁrst time.

“Pitt hired an architect about five years ago to come up with a
design for increasing the seating capacity in the Field House,”
“That move followed some successful seasons when

Pitt’s basketball team played in the NCAA Eastern ﬁnals and the
. NIT (National Invitational Tournament).” -
3 “The seating expansion was part of a master plan for
improvements at the Field House, some of which have been already

During the past four years new student seats were built, in
‘addition to seats with backs for the public. Exit ramps also were
built near the public seating area. A new surface was put down on
the varsity basketball court, and new mercury-vapor lights

Pitt’s basketball record this year as well as spot checks of rising
attendance, are some reasons for increased interest in expansion,

“Attendance ﬁgures vary, though,” Billick said. “It depends on
whether the students are on campus, whether we have a good record
, going for us and the quality of the opponent.”

P A capacity crowd of 5,308 saw the Panthers defeat Crosstown rival
Duquesne, 72-65, Wednesday night.

The repairs will require» inspection
of the steel supporting the granite
pieces decorating the building, and
the reshoring and removal of the
pieces.

Repairs will cost at least
$100,000, Renk said. To fund the
renovations a plant proiect of

‘$100,000 has been submitted for

the new ﬁscal year.

“Within the next ﬁve years
something drastic is going to have
to be done about this problem,”
Renk said.

Thaw Hall, built at the turn of the
century, houses physics laborator-
ies and the departments of Polymer
Engineering and Crystallography.

CAS Major
In Business
Is Proposed

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and
Sciences Council is considering a
proposal to establish an undergrad-
uate double major business pro-
gram. Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg submitted
the proposal at yesterday’s council
meeting.-

Rosenberg, who collaborated
with Dean H. J. Zoffer of the
Graduate School of Business in
drawing up the proposal, said the
program would be “unique and
responsive to needs.”

Rosenberg cited student demand
and the possibility of attracting
more students to Pitt as the
“impetus behind the program.”

He emphasized, however, that
the proposed program would
require a minimum of strictly
professional courses, and would
draw mostly from such “tradition-
al” CAS courses as mathematics,
economics, and psychology.

The double major requirement,
Rosenberg said, would insure a
sound liberal arts background as
well as ample preparation for
business and graduate study.

Rosenberg also pointed out that
the double major program “would
not cause a decrease in the number
of majors in FAS departments.”

“The double major is’ the most
preferable of the various options

that have been considered,” he

added.
Should CAS Council approve the
program, a speciﬁc curriculum plan

Pitt Students Rank First
In Blood Contributions

By CATHY FARNAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt ranks ﬁrst in area colleges
for blood donations and holds more
blood drives per year than any
single student group, according to
Denise Kidzinski, coordinator of

the blood drive sponsored by the-

Central Blood Bank.

Kidzinski described Pitt
students’ attitude as, “fantastic
and enthusiastic; the most coopera-
tive college around.” ‘ Kidzinski
also stressed the major j part
Inter-pan (a combined Interfrater-
nity Council and Panhellenic
group) has contributed.

“Inter-pan has the largest
percentage of donors of any group
in the city,” Kidzinski said.

Last year, Greeks contributed

846 pints. This year 1400
participating Greeks hope to better
1000 pints.

Phil Cillo, chairman of Inter-pan
blood donations and initiator of the
dorm blood drive said, “Blood
donating is an excellent way of
instilling social consciousness in
students. Habitual donating is
essential to the success of the Blood

hospitals. (The Blood Bank relies
totally on voluntary donations).

Cillo attributed the student
donating spirit in part to the
cooperation of the University
administration. , Cillo cited the
auxillary service department in
particular, which sponsors a pizza
party for the ﬂoor with the most
donations in the dorms.

So far this year, Pitt has
contributed 1531 pints. Two more
drives are slated for the future;

Med And Law

Schools Give

1* Public Advice
*

ByCATHYFARNAN
Pitt News Staffwriter

. The schools of law and
medicine at Pitt are currently
involved in clinical programs to
educate and advise county resi-
dents.

Six weeks ago, the law school
launched the development disabili-
ties project, which gives legal
assistance to persons disabled by
mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy and other similar disabilit-

' ies_.

"We are the only program in the
Pittsburgh area that provides legal
advocacy specifically to the devel-
opmentally disabled,” commented
Ilene Shane, director of the
program. Students, under Shane‘
supervision, represent individuals
in legal proceedings, submit briefs,
conduct legislative advocacy and
work with the community. Some
current areas of involvement
include educational opportunities,
access to buildings, medical
services and due process in
sterilization and guardianship pro-
ceedings.

The program, while advocating
for an under-represented segment
of society, also provides an
excellent opportunity for thzi

students to broaden their legal  .

education, Shane said.

Wayne Hays To Reen ter Politics
By The Associated Press
COLUMBUS, 0hio—Wayne L. Hays, whose career as one of the
nation’s most powerful congressmen was cut short by the Elizabeth
Ray sex scandal, re-entered politics yesterday as a candidate for the
Ohio Legislature.

Hays, 67, said he will seek the Democratic nomination in June for
the 99th district seat now held by Rep. A.G. Lancione, a Democrat
who is retiring at age 72.

“I have hadla lot of people ask me to run. I don’t mean 20 or 30, I
mean in the hundreds,” Hays said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press from a St. Clairsville bank where he serves on the
board.

Hays said backers have told him that any references to the 1976
affair with Miss Ray, a Capitol Hill secretary, would only strengthen
their support.

“I think people are inclined to say that has no bearing on this,”
Hays said. “If the constituents hold it as a major bar to my being a
representative, I wouldn’t run.”

In an interview with a Wheeling, W. Va., radio station, Hays
added, “I’m sick and tired of that Elizabeth Ray scandal. Since
when has it been a scandal for a single man to have an ‘affair with a
single girl? It has been blown out of proportion.”

Miss Ray said at the time that she could not even type and was on

. a congressional committee payroll only because she provided Hays

sexual favors. Hays denied that she was hired solely for sexual
reasons.

Hays, who was divorced at the time of the affair, married his
second wife, Pat, a few months before he resigned on September 1,
1976.

lU.$. Steel Slapped with Health and Safety Fines

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—U.S. Steel, the nation’s largest steel company,
was given the U.S. Labor Departmentfs largest- ﬁne ever yesterday
for alleged Federal health and safety violations.

The proposed $215,900 penalty was ordered after inspections by
the Occupational Health and Safety Administration at the
company’s South Works in Chicago, the Labor Department said.

The “litany of job-safety hazards in the 183 pages of citations
represent very real threats to the safety of some 8,000 employees
who work at the'U.S. Steel facility,” said OSHA head Dr. Eula
Bingham.

OSHA said it found serious, willful and repeat violations during
inspections during a six-month period ended last week.

U.S. Steel took exception to the report, charging that OSHA
inspectors seemed more interested in harrassment than in improved
health and safety conditions.

“We are dissatisfied with the manner, attitude and lack of
understanding of heavy industry operations our people encountered
among the teams of inspectors sent into the plant,” a South Works
spokesman said.

He said that OSHA officials failed to notify the company of alleged
violations at the time of the inspections. 1

“Corrective action that might justifiably have been taken
immediately was delayed until inspectors’ reports were finished——a
procedure that seems inconsistent with OSHA’s avowed purpose,”
the spokesman said. .

The Labor Department termed all ﬁnes “proposed penalties” an
officials said U.S. Steel may appeal through administrative and
legal channels. -

Field House:

“I think our student support has
been good this year, and with an
even better basketball team in
future years, it would be even
stronger,” Billick said.

“We’re also interested in at-
tracting top student-athletes to
Pitt, so we need a larger seating
capacity than what we have. Most
everyone playing major college
basketball has a larger field house

than we do.

“We’re also looking to attract
top-quality opposition here in
Pittsburgh,” he added.

The plans being reviewed call for ,

decks of seats‘ over existing seating
on both sides of the court. Student
seats would then extend back to the
walls. Billick said.

“Some additional seats would be
added behind the baskets,” Billick
said, bringing the proposed capa-

seats.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Pretorian Censorship

Eugene Hugo, like Steven Biko, has taken his place as a symbol
of the repressive policies of South Africa’s white minority Govern-
ment. His name will not become as famous as that of Biko, but his
case is another clear signal that Premier John Vorster’s Nationalist
Party has no intention of letting South Africa join the free world.

Until last week, Hugo was the Washington correspondent of
The Johannesburg Star. He now has been called back to South
Africa for doing his job.

According to The Washington Post, Hugo’s recall stems from
his reporting several days ago of “a controversy involving South
African officials in Washington.” Hugo had reported that two
South African agents———a’ Government official and an employee of
paid South African lobbyists—-had eavesdropped on closed
Congressional hearings concerning developments in South Africa.
One of the hearings involved Donald Woods, a “banned" jour-
nalist who recently escaped from that country.

Representative Thomas Downey (D-N.Y.), a coordinator of the
of the Congressional committee involved, said Hugo’s detailed
reports were “very accurate” and “unbiased.”

Pro—Govemment newspapers in South Africa immediately con-
demned Hugo, and officials in Pretoria were reported to be con-
sidering revoking his passport. Hugo was then informed by his
newspaper that he was being called home for another assignment.

Very few persons, we hope, are under the impression that there is
any true freedom of the press in South Africa. The shutdown a few
months ago of the leading black newspaper there, coupled with the
general roundup and detention of many opposition leaders, should
have been enough to dispel any rumors of toleration within the‘
apartheid Government. But, in case anyone was in doubt, the

;;z;\;".:]
s), __

. Hugo case provides an example that is both blatant and close to

home.

The Pretoria Government's stifling of reporter Hugo-though
hardly a crime of the same magnitude—is not unrelated to the
death of Biko last September. Both incidents are products of the
same political system. More important, the two incidents, when
generalized, enter into a cause and effect relationship. -

Press censorship contributes to the continuation of repressive

regimes. Repressive regimes tend to silence opposition leaders, of-
ten permanently. Unfortunately, it is as simple as that.

If oonstructive social change is to come in South Africa, if Biko’s
death and Hugo’s throttling are not to be harbingers of things’ to
come, then pressure must be put on South Africa to allow freedom
of expression by both blacks and whites. A responsible press is not
necessarily one that only prints material favorable to the govern-
ment. For the sake of human rights, the Pretoria regime must be
impressed with this fact. Otherwise, South Africa will continue to
beg for a bloody guerrilla war.

Validity of ROTC Credits Rejected

In 1967, the Faculty of Arts and
Science voted that members of the
Reserve‘ Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) could not receive accredita-
tion for their ROTC courses. Every
year since, there have been articles
in The Pitt News and ROTC
propaganda all over campus
demanding ROTC be reinstated as
an accredited CAS program. The
argument ROTC puts forward is
that, in a liberal arts education,
students should be able to study
whatever they want; that to deny
them credit is to deny them the right
to study what they want, putting an
extra burden on their shoulders
because they must take p extra
classes. This is all ROTC students
tell us. Somehow, they always seem
to ignore the content of what they
are studying, as if their course is
just another ordinarycourse at Pitt
with the same ends in mind.

In reality, however, the push for
ROTC isn’t— merely the result of

’ some students feeling an injustice.

It is a push that is national in scope,

of this “new” Monty Python ﬁlm by
frequently questioning the distrib-
utor of the ﬁlm, New Line Cinema.
In return for our interest, Pangborn
members were twice verbally
insulted over the phone by
representatives of New Line
Cinema, and then New Line sent us
a preview “trailer” for “Monty
Python Meets Beyond The Fringe”
that did not include any scenes from
the actual ﬁlm.

Although we suspected the ﬁlm
was indeed a direct“steal” from a
previously-aired NET television
program, New Line Cinema cat-
egorically denied this. Because our
arrangement with Pitt's audio-
visual services department does not
permit us to preview any of our ﬁlms
before they're screened for the
public, we had no way of knowing
that the bulk of this “new” Python
ﬁlm had already been twice
televised in the Pittsburgh area
until we screened the ﬁlm for the

just like the push to reinstate the
draft. This is because the United
States military is in trouble, and,
without a strong military, the
United States can’t protect its
overseas investments.

The United States is a super-
power and uses its military to
“defend democracy” throughout
the world. What is this democracy
we are told we are defending? In
reality, wherever the people of a
country _try to shake off foreign
domination, imperialism and its
puppets, the United States steps in
to “help out.” However, it is
always imperialism and its puppets
that we help out. If we are willing to
allow a country to be’ formally
independent, having its own
government and elections, we make
sure the United States has economic
control.

For instance, in Rhodesia, the
United States supports a majority

, rule plan that will insure the safety

of chrome resources for corpora-
tions like Union Carbide. In Chile,
we supported democracy until such
things as the copper industry that
we had controlled were nationaliz-
ed; we then funded a fascist coup to
overthrow the Chilean government.
We find inappropriate to overlook
human rights in places like Iran and
the Philipines, where human rights
are virtually non-existent, and we
give military support to the fascist
regimes of the Shah and Marcos
who, in turn, give United States
corporations the right to make all
the loot they can get.
When such democracies are in
trouble, the United States govern-
ment is straight to the rescue. But
in reality they are only rescuing
themselves. They tried to stop the
liberation struggles of the people of
Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia and
Laos, but _in addition to getting
beaten they exposed their true
character to the whole world,
including the people at home. We
saw that the govemment’s brand of
patriotism is no more patriotic than
trying to break the strikes of
American workers. When the
people began to realize this, there
arose such opposition to the military
and imperialist war that the draft
was discontinued. America has had
to rely on a volunteer army ever
since.

Because of United States defeats
overseas, the economy has suffered
harsh setbacks. With no jobs
available and layoffs increasing,
blacks and other minorities, who are
always the last to be hired and the
ﬁrst to be laid off, have been forced
to turn to the volunteer Army for

' jobs. Now, 22 percent of the armed

forces are black, while only 11
percent of the civilian population is
black. All minority groups compose
30 percent of the volunteer Army. It
is also interesting to note that
although 16 percent of all Marines
are Black, only 2 percent of the
ofﬁcers and none of the generals are
black.

This poses a serious problem
because the volunteers have joined
out of economic need rather than
patriotic desire and, unlike ROTC
graduates, they ‘have not been
indoctrinated into following orders
from the hierarchy without thinking
about what they're doing. So today,
if troops are sent to Africa and the
black men are told to shoot down
their African brothers who are
ﬁghting for their independence,
they are likely to be deﬁant soldiers
who will refuse. A person from
Pittsburgh might have a hard time
defending U.S. Steel’s right to build
a mill in a Third World country
when the mills in his own city are
shutting down. Just because
someone joins the Army doesn’t
mean that they will forget their class
backgrounds.

Some ROTC.students have been

known to respond to this by saying '

that it is not their fault that many of
the military’s practices are oppres-
sive and serve imperialism. They

say that because America is a 4""!

democracy the military can be
changed to meet our interests/.
However, the problems] with the
United States military don’t origi-
nate in the “bad ideas” of
somebody in the Pentagon. They
stem from the fact that the United
States is an imperialist superpower
and as long as it is, the interests of
the military and the interests of
those who serve in it will be in direct
opposition.
The interests of the military and

those of ROTC are the same. ROTC "

students have to actively serve in
the military. The Department of
Defense has ultimate control over
ROTC course content and the
instructors. Whatever input the
University has can be taken away at
any time.

The question of ROTC at Pitt is
not whether some ROTC students
should have more or less of a load
placed on their shoulders, as they
would have us believe. The real
issue is whether or not the military
should be expanding on Pitt's
campus. It is not in the interests of "
Pitt students togive credit to ROTC.

A Letter From Prison

By MARK MURPHY

President Richard M. Nixon
San Clemente, Calif.

Dear Mr. President,

I just returned from watering the
eggplants in my garden outside the
cottage here at prison, and thought
I should drop you a note.

Everything is just wonderful
here. The people are nice, the food
is good and my volleyball team is
in first place. The prison is quiet
enough to do some writing, and
now that my book is out, I will
become rich, just like the rest of the
old gang who went to jail and
managed to cash in on it. Except
you, of course, Mr. President.

You probably have seen some
excerpts of the book in the papers
or magazines. Well, don’t believe
everything you read, Chief; I’m
just pulling a double reverse on
everybody._ Relax, I have a good
game plan. I won’t stonewall them
like Liddy or spill my guts the way
Dean did. If we give everybody
something they think they don’t
know, it’s more than enough to
keep them happy. Just like the old
days, right Chief?

But, even you have to admit,
some of the book is true. How
about the part where I said the
United States and Russia were
going to team up and have a good
old-fashioned nuclear attack on
China? ‘It was right around the time
you said we had to act more like the
Kennedys. I walked in to the office
with the plan, you had your back
brace on, and David Eisenhower
was crawling under your desk. You
vetoed the plan, then said
something about being a Berliner.

Look it up if you d_on’t believe
me, Chief. It’s right on the

’ tapes-—uh, sorry, wasn’t going to

mention them. But, as long as
we’re on the subject, I did tell

people about the big gap. Don’t
worry, I didn’t tell them the real
reason everything was erased. I
know you're a klutz, and one day
you tripped on the shag carpeting,
and you chin landed on the foot
pedal. It was just an isolated
incident. We can stonewall on that,
Chief.

You probably are upset I told
everyone that you knew from the
ﬁrst about the original break-in. I
remember you told me one day in
early June 1972 that you personally

PERSUASIONS

“The prison is quiet
enough to do some
writing, and now that
my book is out, I ’ll get
rich just like the rest of
the old gang who went
to jail and managed to
cash in on it. Except
you, of course, Mr.
President. ”

were going to enter the Watergate
and bug the Democrats. But, true
to form, you decided against that
plan when I said you could break in
by yourself, but someone was
bound to spot those 10 Secret
Service men and the dog.

So you decided to give the job to
some Cubans, and ended up in a lot
of trouble. Is that what you get for
hiring minority workers? People
forget that you advanced the
caused of several professions
during your administration. .News-
paper people make more money
because of you, judges get much
more respect, and the special
prosecutor business is booming.

Let’s ‘remember these guys are
good for votes when we make our
big comeback in—oops, sorry,
almost spilled it again. I’m starting
to sound off like John Dean. It just
shows you what this tough prison
living will do to a guy.

I also thought it was time
everyone knew who Deep Throat
was. I wrote it was Fred Fielding.
Dean’s old assistant. How could
you not suspect a guy like him? He
knew everything there was to tell;
he worked for Dean, which means
he was trying to bring down our
Presidency, and he does look like
Hal Holbrook. It must be him,
Chief.

He denies it, of course, and says
he wasn't even in the country when
one of his meetings with Wood-
ward took place. But they have
parking garages all over the world.
Or he could have left some
information tacked to a wall.
No-good ingrate. Let’s see if we
give Fielding a job when we come
back to power—darn, did it again.

Just one more thing, Chief. The
Washington Post got hold of my
book, and printed things earlier
than others. Will you tell me how a
paper wih such sloppy journalists
continually can come up with
scoops? I wish I knew who was
leaking stuff to them. That
probably cost me a‘good thousand
bucks in royalties.

Well, it was fun to write, but I
have to go play squash with the
guys. I’m playing a guy who says
that you and I are his idols. He
used to do freelance interrogating
work for oppressive regimes before
he fell in with the wrong crowd.

Good luck with your book. If it
makes half the loot I will make on
mine, you might even be able to
pay all the back taxes you owe.

Cordially,
Bob

Recognizing Women and Hockey

In reading the article by Jim Pane
in the Feb. 15 issue of The Pitt
News, and letters to the edito1:-by
Bob Evans and Nickolas Martin in
the Feb. 22 issue, I found myself
caught in the middle. Being both a
female and a member of the Pitt
hockey club, I found myself
all three

Speaking as a female, for many
years women’s athletics were
looked upon basically as a means of
exercise. It was not thought
feminine to compete athletically.
Since Title IX has emerged,,.the
administration is obligated..to
expandithe women’s program, and
it’s high time they did. However,
that doesn’t mean that men’s sports
should be overlooked. The concept
of women’s athletics and ice hockey
are relatively new as compared to

%-raotball, baseball and basketball.
’ Both programs should be expand-

ed. Along with women’s sports, ice
hockey deserves to be a major
university program.

Since the formation of the Pitt
hockey club seven years ago, they
have produced an overall winning
record of 72-28-5. The individual
members of the club must put a
great deal of their time, efforts and
money into the club. Members pay
dues and must also supply their own
equipment. The only rink available
for practice, when it is available, is

~ about 45 minutes from campus.

One player makes all the travel and
accomodation arrangements for
away trips, while each member has
to pay for his own accomodations.

The players themselves also handle

a large portion of the public
relations dealing with the team.
These members are dedicated to
the sport and are determined to
keep the club inexistence and see
it achieve varsity status. They are
willing to put forth the efforts, but in
my dealings with various members,
I can see the frustrations of
acquiring very little cooperation and

support from the University athletic .

department. It is hard to believe
that this is how a college club is
forced to exist. The Pitt hockey club
doesn’t deserve recognition instead
of women’s athletics, but in
addition to it.

So you want a haircut, but think
Oakland doesn’t have the right
salon for you.

Wrong. Oakland’s salons offer a
variety of hair cure; the problem
lies in choosing the correct salon
for your needs.

Salvatore Puccini of Pittsburgh,

110 Bouquet St., is the only salon in
Oakland that offers full service. A
customer could go into Puccini and
come out a different person.
“We are directly associated with
the total look of the individual,”
said Salvatore Puccini, the salon’s

owner and hair designer. “We
offer everything from a haircut to
colorings. permanents and com-

plete skin care and makeup
applications.”

His salon is patronized by people
who are concerned about their
looks, Puccini said, and who are
willing to spend time and money
making the most of themselves.
Puccini instructs his staff of hair
designers on current styles and

procedures every Tuesday night.

“My staff takes a full 45 minutes
on each cut, which allows time to
discuss the cut with the customer."
Puccini said.

The salon also offers specialized
shampoos, conditioners, brushes
and makeup. Blow dryers and
curling irons also are sold.

“We try to attract students by
specials, and by being involved
with student buying cards,”
Puccini explained. “We discuss
price with customers before they
are shampooed. This way, no one
needs to be embarrassed.”

The current special at Puccini is
$15 for a haircut, styling brush and
bottle of shampoo. Permanents
start around $25, and are subject to
increase due to length or style of
hair. A complete makeup applica-
tion is $7.50.

Corso’s Hair People, 121 Oak-
land Ave., has a barbershop
downstairs and a beauty salon
upstairs. “We usually do the
permanents upstairs, especially on
men, so they won’t feel uncomfort-
able,” said hairdresser Patty Ebdy.
Corso’s also offers colorings.
stylings and eyebrow-arching.

“I like my job here because we
don’t pressure-sell any of our
products,” said Ebdy. “I enjoy
giving a haircut a person can live
with."

Corso’s staff attends classes
three times a year, and also attends
hair shows.

“A good haircut usually travels
by word of mouth,” said Ebdy. “If
I do one good cut, I may get more
customers. If a customer leaves

Pricing Kegs and Cases

By DAVE MCDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Billy Martin, Joe Frazier and
the Van Arsdale twins may know
the type of beer they like to drink,
but they would have a tough time
deciding where to buy large
quantities of their brew if they were
shopping in Oakland. These
notable beer drinkers also may be
curious as to who delivers and for
how much (especially Martin.)

There are three beer distributors
in Oakland: Craig Distributing
Company, at 313 North Craig St.;
Mellinger Beer Distributor, at- 404
Semple St.; and Oakland Beer
Distributing Company, 3538 Fraz-
ier St. (in very South Oakland, next
to Frazier Field).

If you're an extremely big beer
drinker, or are inviting a few big
beer drinkers over. it is best to buy
beer in the halrf-keg size. Nec-
essary complements for ~_ a ‘keg
include a tap. a tub4_(or‘i.'anything to

, hold the keg and ‘keep icearound it)

and someone to deliver the heavy.
liquid-ﬁlled keg.

All three Oakland beer distribu-
tors carry all of the major

name-brand beers in kegsgand
they all deliver. At the Oakland

, drinkers

Beer Distributing Company, the
lowest price for a half-keg of beer is
$19.50, the delivery charge is $1,
tub rental is $1 and the tap rental is
$1. The rental of a tap also must
include a $35 deposit, and all kegs
require a $10 deposit in Pennsyl-
vania.

At the Craig Distributing Com-
pany, prices are a bit steeper--half-
kegs start at $22, with a $3 delivery
charge. Picnic-type taps are $1
with a $30 deposit, and the
gravity-type tap is free with a $15
deposit. Tub rental costs another
$3 at Craig.

Mellinger Beer Distributors
seems to have the best deal on
keg—buying in Oakland. Prices
start at $21, but there is no charge
for delivery, tub or tap. The
deposit charge is $35 for the tap.

The next size in line for beer
is the quarter-keg.
Oakland Beer Distributing charges
$13.75 for its lowest-priced quart-
er-keg, and has a 50 cents delivery
charge. Mellinger again has the
best deal, charging only $13.60 for
the quarter. with no delivery
charge. A quarter-keg of favorite
brew_ at Craig starts at $13.50. The
delivery charge is $2.

If you drink beer by the case, the
most economical and ecological
way to buy beer is in returnable
bottles. Savings can be as great as
$1 when you buy a case of
returnables. A case of Iron City
returnables costs $5.95 at Oakland.
The cheapest case of beer at Craig
is $6.50, and is $6.60 at
Mel1inger’s. Delivery charges are
30 cents at Oakland and Melling-
er’s. and $1 at Craig.

For the six-pack beer drinker,
the Original seems to be the place
to go. The Original, at 3901 Forbes
Ave., is known for its $1.85 specials
on featured 16-ounce six-packs.
Beer distributors cannot sell beer
in quantities of less than a case; the
Original cannot sell more than 144
ounces at a time to one person.

Editor’s Note: Next; week's
consumer corner will be on buying
and developingiﬁlm in Oakland.

unhappy, I may lose some
business.” Corso's stylists concen-
trate on giving a natural cut, that
requires little or no care.

A hair cut at Corso’s costs $12 to
$14 for women, and $10 to $12 for
men. Permanents start around $25.

Great Expectations, 237 Atwood
St., boasts precision haircutting.
They also offer permanents and
colorings. “We don’t make avail-
able any other type of product
because we are only concerned
with the hair,” said salon manager
Saul Pearlstein.

The salon has a number of books
of current hairstlyes, so the
customer can pick a style before the
cutting. “Whatever the customer
suggests, that is the cut they will
receive, unless they ask the stylist
to suggest a cut for them,” said
Pearlstein.

A guarantee accompanies each
cut at Great Expectations. If
something is wrong with the cut,
the salon will correct it without
charge.

Great Expectations offers a
number of shampoos and condi-
tioners. Curling irons and blow
dryers are also for sale.

A haircut at Great Expectations
is always $10,
usually are $25.

Claffey’s, 119 Oakland Ave., is
one of a chain of salons, and offers
budget prices on haircuts, perma-
nents and sets. Claffey’s usually is
patronized by women who have
their hair set each week.

Although Claffey’s does not have
many teenaged customers, the
staff is experienced in cutting and
perming.

Prices at Claffey’s do not
increase due to length of hair.
Permanents range from $11 to $25,
depending on’ the perm. A haircut

and blow dry (sorry, no curling

irons) costs $8.50.

The staffs of all four Oakland
salons agree that a good shampoo
can be purchased only from a
salon, the most important factor
between the customer and hair-
dresser is communication, and that
when in doubt, a customer should
ask the hair dresser.

The Academy Awards are more

of a spectacle than any of the ﬁlms I

nominated for best picture. This

year is no exception, with such

tried and true Hollywood formulas
as the actor who never won the big
one, the dynamic newcomer, the
playwright’s wife, and the re-
spected foreign actor.
Nominations for Best Actor are
Richard Burton (“Equus”), Rich-
ard Dreyfuss (“The Goodbye
Girl”), Woody Allen (“Annie
Hall”), Marcello Mastroianni (“A
Special Day”) _and John Travolta
(“Saturday Night Fever”).
Burton, after years of wallowing
in bad parts, after years of being
overshadowed by his marriage to
Elizabeth Taylor, has finally
surfaced in a role that showcases‘
his talent. I think Burton will win.
not only because he is excellent as
the psychiatrist in “Equus,” but
because he has been nominated

four times before and has never
won.

Travolta, who made the surprise
leap from television sweathog to
superstar deﬁnitely has a riveting
stage presence some claim is
reminiscent of a young Brando.
But excepting his role in “Carrie”
where he dumped pig’s blood over
Sissy Spacek at the prom, every
role he has played (including the
upcoming “Grease”) has been that
of a lower-class Italian. Granted,
Brando always played angry young
men, but Travolta’s range has not
been established. Dreyfuss is a
ﬁne actor, but “The Goodbye Girl”
was a witty bit of ﬂuff and he
deserves to win in a role that gives
him a chance to display his full
talent. His past performance in-
“The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz” showed he was a brilliant
actor and there is no doubt that
Dreyfuss will be among the
nominees again soon.

Mastroianni can be considered
out of the running because foreign

actors rarely capture the Oscar and
then only when the rest of the ﬁeld
is below par.

Woody Allen is a genius.
Someday, he is going to be
recognized as one of the greatest
ﬁlm makers of this century, even
surpassing Chaplin. But despite
excellent performances in ﬁne
ﬁlms like “Play It Again, Sam”
and “Sleeper,” he's never been
nominated as an actor before.
Since “Annie Hall” is a comedy,
since many suspect it parallels his
real life relationship with co-star
Dianne Keaton, he probably won’t
win. (Most likely, Keaton will, but
since Allen wrote and directed
“Annie Hall” (picking up nomina-
tions in both categories), the
sentiment is that Allen is playing
out true life instead of acting.

The other nominees for best
actress are Shirley MacLaine and
Anne Bancroft (“The Turning
Point”), Jane Fonda (“Julia”), and
Marsha Mason (“The Goodbye
Girl”).

MacLaine, another several-time
nominee who has never won, and
Bancroft, a past winner for “The
Miracle Worker,” will cancel each
other out as they were in the same
picture. Mason is married to Neil
Simon, who wrote “The Goodbye
Girl,” but favoritism isn’t a factor
here—the dialogue clearly favors
co-star Richard Dreyfuss. Mason is
a past nominee for “Cinderella
Liberty” but her latest role is not
the stuff that Oscars are won on.

Fonda and Keaton are the real
contestants in the race. A former
winner for “Klute,” Fonda is ﬁne
as Lillian Hellman in the true story
of Hellman and her Nazi-ﬁghting

friend Julia. But Keaton is coming —

off two ﬁne performances——she
almost copped a nomination for
“Looking for Mr. Goodbar” as well
as “Annie Hall.” Since she broke
into ﬁlms with “Play It Again,
Sam” and “The Godfather”
(another nomination in the latter),
Keaton has built a strong following

and will likely win. A strike against
Fonda is her ﬁne performance in
“Coming Home” which will
probably give her‘ a shot at it next

year.. 1
Best Picture nominees are
“Julia,” “Annie Hall,” “Star

Wars,” “The Turning Point” and
“The Goodbye Girl.”

“The Goodbye Girl” is set as a
ﬁlmed stage play, so count it out.
“Star Wars” will likely be the
victim of Hollywood snobbery,
losing because actors take a
backseat to robots, and special
effects are the real stars. “Turning
Point” is a gussied-up soap opera.

The race is between “Annie
Hall” and “Julia” and the latter
will get the nod because it initiated
the trend of women’s pictures. It is
also the true story of Hellman, of
the few who stood up to the
blacklists of the McCarthy era.
Since Hollywood is patting itself on
the back, bending over backward to
salute McCarthy deﬁers, “Julia’s”
chances are even better. “Annie

Hall” may be a surprise winner,
but it is doubtful.

Best supporting actor nominees
are Peter Firth (“Equus”), Sir Alec

Guinness (“Star Wars”), Mikhail-

Baryshinkov (“The Turning
Point”) and Jason Robards and
Maximillian Schell (“Julia”).

Guinness will probably win, but
Firth is an exciting newcomer who
starred in the stage version of
“Equus” as well and could pull an
upset.

Best Supporting Actress nomi-
nees are Quinn Cummings (“The
Goodbye Girl”), Leslie Browne
(“The Turning Point”), Tuesday
Weld (“Looking for Mr. Goodbar”)
and Vanessa Redgrave (“Julia”).

Redgrave has it wrapped up for
‘‘Julia.’’ Weld was great in
“Goodbar,” but Redgrave ‘had a
better script. Cummings may draw
some support because she's only

Film Studies Proves Popular
With NutsAnd BoItsAnd Art

By MARTHA GARVEY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Students at Pitt can watch and
make ﬁlms for credit, as well as
pleasure. Through the CAS Film
Studies program, students take
courses in women and film,
contemporary Japanese ﬁlm and
literature and ﬁlm. They also study
the ﬁne points of ﬁlmmaking at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, at 205
Oakland Avenue.

Professors in various CAS
departments have taught classes in
ﬁlm for several years; the courses
only were coordinated as a program
in 1974. The program was begun
by former ﬁne arts professor Bill
Judson. When Judson left to
become curator of the ﬁlm program
at the Carnegie Institute, psychol-
ogy professor Bruce Goldstein and
English professor Marcia Landy
became co-directors.

Landy estimates that approxi-
mately 300 students are currently
taking courses in ﬁlm. Despite
obvious interest in ﬁlm, ﬁlm
studies in still not a major at Pitt.

“lt’s so contradictory,” Landy T

said. “I don't understand it. The

University doesn't understand that St
Pittsburgh is a ﬁlm center in the  .
They could. 

United States.
taking advantage of that.”

9 Robert Marshall_;- dean of CAS,’ I _
said he supports making ﬁlm 

studies a major.
“Film is as worthy of study and

academic credit as literature-

painting or theater," Marshall
said.

“When asked if ﬁlm studies,
with its technical classes, did not
fall into vocational training, Mar-
shall said, “Everyone involved in
the ﬁlm studies program, including
those who might be considered to
have a more technical bent, is
committed to ﬁlm studies as a
liberal arts program. It’s not a
career program.”

Last term, in a course taught by
Landy, students examined the roles
of women in ﬁlms like “The Little
Foxes,” with Bette Davis, to a
documentary on working women in
Latin America and a ﬁlm about
revolutionaries in Africa.

Students were given the option
of making ﬁlms for their ﬁnal

.  ..... .. (ms

grades. The students’ ﬁlms
differed from one another’s—from
a black comedy about a woman who
kills her husband by ruining the
engine of his Volkswagen, to a
short, 3-minute ﬁlm that showed
nothing but water running over a
woman’s body.

“What have I learned?” asked
one student from the class. “These
courses have opened up my
thinking. I took my ﬁrst ﬁlm course
because I like ﬁlm, and have
always wanted to know more about
it. Films aren’t just entertainment.

Film is not a greater art——or lesser
art-—than literature or theater. I
enjoy theater and literature, but,
for .me, it’s easiest to explore
values and culture through ﬁlm.”

‘Q11

 

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

In the teams’ first meeting, Duquesne boxed Larry

Harris, but, in the return match Wednesday night,

Sam Clancy did the boxing as the Pitt Panthers
defeated the Dukes, 72-65, at the Field House.

Before a standing-room only crowd of 5,308

Clancy boxed out the entire Duquesne team en route

to gathering a game-high 20 rebounds in addition to

leading the Panthers in scoring with 19 points.

 

As has been the story with every Pitt-Duquesne

- matchup of late, there were things that went

according to form and things that went against the
patterns.

The Dukes’ front line of John Moore, Jesse
Hubbard and Rich Cotten was held to 29 points, after
being a dominating force in the first meeting, in which
they combined for 48 points and 20 rebounds. The Pitt
backcourt that could garner only six ﬁeld goals at the
Civic Arena combined for 11, which went a long way in
helping Tim Grgurich unwrap John Cinicola’s box.

Duquesne dominated the boards in the first game, but I

Pitt enjoyed a ﬁve-rebound edge in the rematch,
46-41.

It took Larry Harris 13 minutes to score a field goal
at the Arena; his first jumper Wednesday found its
mark before many of the fans had found a place to
stand. And possibly the most important difference in
the eyes of the Pitt fans (outside of the score) was the
Panthers taking the game to the Dukes, rather than
waiting for something to happen and then hoping it
wasn’t bad. So much for the differences.

Steelers—Raiders, Flyers—Bruins and Panthers-
Dukes. The rivalries are equally intense with
emotional outbreaks, otherwise known as ﬁghts,
being known to break out with more frequency than a
good case of hives. Moore had his white sweatbands
spattered with blood before the first half was six

_ minutes old. B.B. Flenory and Clancy each tested the

hardness of the Field House floor on different
occasions, with the Duquesne guard and the court
losing their respective battles.

Wayne Talbott, Pete Strickland, Fred Moon,
Flenory and Moore all took time from the game to
exchange personal niceties with each other. The
referees, Joe Gruber and Bob Hill, deserve
commendation for keeping the game under control.

Harris, playing his ﬁnal game before a Field House

A  crowd, was able to get his shots regardless of the

defense Duquesne threw at him. Harris’s 18 points

 - -dropped his magic number to 28 (needed to become

I - . the career Pitt scoring leader), most of them coming

I . from the outside with one rim-rattling exception.

Terry Knight kept Pitt alive, and Duquesne out of
their box-and-one with his first-half shooting. Knight
was the only Panther to convert better than 50 percent
of his ﬁeld goal attempts (six for eight) for a total of 17
points. His seven rebounds, three steals and two
assists spelled r=e-l-i-e-f from the box-and-one.

Strickland continued to wear an ‘S’ under his
warmups, coming off the bench with Pitt trailing by
six, 21-15, in the first half and not leaving until the

' Panthers had built themselves a nice lead well into the

second half. Strickland, who didn’t have an inordinate
number of points or assists, provided the ball hawking
Pitt needed on defense, and the ball movement
Grgurich relishes on offense.

“Strickland helped them a lot tonight coming offthe
bench,” Cinicola said. “We were worried about
Strickland because he takes away some of the things
we like to do.” ,

The Pope is Catholic. The earth is round. The sun
rises in the East. Clancy dominated the boards. So

what else is new?

“Sam is just an innate rebounder.” Grgurich said.
“I wish I could say we taught him to rebound, but I

Grapplers ' Victory Goes Virtually Unnoticed

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

WHEELING, W. Va.--West

Pitt 118-pounder Glenn Max-
well‘s pin of Mike Perry at 6:14,

“We took charge from the
beginning and just kept coming,”
Adams said.

Virginia head wrestling coach Fred
Lechti watched as the 400
spectators filed out of the 7,000-seat
Wheeling Civic Center after his

,team’s 42-3 loss to 16th-ranked Pitt
9 Wednesday night.

’"“This is the most populated area

“ifor wrestling in the state," he said.

“West Virginia, as a state,
traditionally hasn’t had good
wrestling."

The Mountaineers didn't do
much to change that tradition.
Mickey McDonald's 8-5 decision
over Panther 150-pounder Mike
Popliokowski drew West Virginia to
within 17 points, 20-3, halfway
through the match—but that’s as
close as the contest became.

“It was hard to tell tonight, but
we’ve had a good year (7-l0),”

 ' , :_»-:hti said after his team’s last dual

match. “There were a lot of
surprises——l expected it to be more
competitive in spots as it turned
out.”

<

142-pounder Steve Gouletas’s pin of
Rodney Johnson at 4:44 and
158-pounder Tom Jones’s pin of
senior Craig March at 3:39 were
three surprises, especially since all
three Panthers are freshmen.

“I wasn’t surprised,” Pitt head
coach Dave Adams said of the three
pins. “They’ve all really come
along. Jones is not a big pinner. but
he’s capable. Maxwell’s near-side
cradle has really come along-he
did it in the quadrangular meet at
Navy (and earned two pins). And
Gouletas is a tenacious wrestler
who's doing a good job for us.

“I'm very pleased’ all around.
This is a type of match where we
could have had a letdown.”

After Maxwell’s leadoff pin,
Panther 126-pounder Jose Martinez
decisioned Bob Mendenhall, 10-4,
and all-America 134-pounder
Rande Stottlemyer followed with an
18-5 super-superior decision over
helpless Mark Cagle to give Pitt a
14-0 lead.‘

After Gouletas’s pin and Pop-
liokowski’s loss, the Panthers swept
the remaining matches. Jones
pinned his opponent after building
up a 7-0 lead; 167-pounder Jim
Gordon held off Cliff Boone, 6-2;
190-pounder Bill Bailey crushed
Jeff Roscoe, 18-9 and the Moun-
taineers forfeited the heavyweight
match to produce the final lopsided
score.

“We expected to do better
tonight,” Lechti said, “but you
can't take anything away from Pitt.
Adams has his program going
well—those wins against Clarion
(31-9) and at the Navy quadrangular
(a 22-18 victory over 10th-ranked
Cleveland State, a 26-18 win over
Navy and a 22-18 decision over
William & Mary) were tremendous
accomplishments.”

It's A Whole New Season for Grgurich, Pitt Basketball

When the difference between this season, now 15-8
for Tim Grgurich, and the last, when a week had
more days than the Panthers had wins, is to be
calculated, astronomical terms are to be used. Only a
year separates the seasons, but it is a light-year.

While a large (as large as 6-6 can be) portion of
Pitt’s current success was secured when Sam Clancy
decided to spend four years looking down at the Field
House rims, most of the advance came later, as the
season entered the new year. Many of the reasons
behind a 21-loss season maintained their hold on
Pitt’s basketball team as many as six weeks into this
season.

‘The team wasn’t driven to embarrassment by its on-
court confusion, as it had been a year before, but it
was losing more often than it should have. The team
had too much talent to go 6-21, but a below-.500
record was not beneath its grasp.

The better players were criticized, the others—par-
ticularly several starters and some of the most-used
substitutes—were mentioned in phrases that involved

, fates worse than four seasons at Robert Morris. As is

the usual case, ‘the harshest words were aimed at the

coach.

What was talk in the crowd became louder and
more frequent. The talkabout Grgurich, who is in
the ﬁnal season of the three-year contract hesigned
when Buzz Ridl retired, reached higher than the top
of the Field House stands—-and back, into those of-
fices along the second tier where a coach’s future is,
on occasion, mulled.

Then, during a ﬁve-game homestretch that saw Pitt
win thrice and blow two other games, the Panthers
came around. Grgurich’s spats with players were set-
tled; in at least one case, the truce was made apparent
when Grgurich ceased to bench his star; in others, the
end of the battle was signalled when Grgurich ceased
to use several Panthers.

The Pitt coach changed more in two weeks than
some coaches change in 10 years. It was all for the

 

better. His lineup switches were made because of
ability, in an effort to advance the team and not on
attitude in an attempt merely to keep it from falling
apart. Substitutions were made according to the
Panthers’ needs. Grgurich’s command of his team,
and its play, increased enough to lead Pitt to what
could be a I7-win regular season. Grgurich aged as
quickly as he did well.

Grgurich’s public face changed, also. He still had
the same optimism and deep emotion where Pitt

basketball is concerned, the same belief his team .

should play with anyone, but his public profile has
been tempered. His quotes are not as stunning as

they once were sure to be, and his courtside manner is
relatively reserved, but neither new posture invites
the cutting criticism its predecessor did.

And so Pitt’s players, aware of where each stood
and able to assume a role, won a Panthers’ share of
basketball games. The games this team has blown
outnumber those in which it has been blown away,
and while that hurts, it is better to lose at the buzzer
than to endure B.B. Flenory taunting with a dribble.

The Panthers leave today for Rutgers and ‘
,Massachusetts on a trip that will determine their

seeding in an Eastern 'Eight tournament they well
could win. Pitt takes with it the league’s leading
rebounder (Clancy), its most prolific scorer (Harris)
and the league-round respect earned with wins
against Villanova, Maryland and Duquesne. It also
will travel the East Coast with the only local big-time
coach likely to have his job for any appreciable
length of time after the tournament.

Aside from congratulating both Grgurich and the
students from their performance Wednesday night,
Cas Myslinski’s major concern with Pitt basketball
lately probably has concerned what his contract offer
to Grgurich will be and. how many seats to add to the
Field House.

Grgurich’s stock has risen tremendously in the past
six weeks: not only because his record has become
the root of resurging interest in Pitt basketball, but
also, important, because Tim Grgurich has emerged
the type of coach his supporters hoped he’d have the
chance to become.

Wdnesday Was Just Not Duquesnes Day

ByMARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer
Wednesday was not
Duquesne’s night:
Before the game, the recently
resurrected‘Tiger Paul strode

to be

 

backs of ﬁve Panthers who were

across the basketball court in a new
blue and gold outfit, provoking
rousing renditions of “Let’s Go
Pitt.” During the game, the Dukes
spent a lot of time looking at the

 

running away with the basketball
and the game, 72-65. And after the
game, one Pitt fan celebrated the
big win by punching out Du-
quesne’s head cheerleader, Mossie
Murphy.

Pete Strickland continues to perforrn well coming off the bench.

The announced crowd of 5,308
fans-——and what seemed to be 1,000
unannounced fans—didn’t watch a
great basketball game, but they did
see a Pitt-Duquesne game. It
wasn’t pretty, but it did have its
usual amount of psychological
warfare.

The usual proﬁle of the opposing
team was nowhere to be found in
the game program prepared by
Pitt. An oversight, perhaps, or a
lack of space, but we all know a
team is easier to beat if they don’t
exist.

Duquesne coach John Cinicola
played the psych game early. He
requested that the referee tell the
Pitt band not to play while his team
had the ball. A reasonable request,
except the referee has no power to
do that, which is something
Cinicola probably knew anyway.
Pitt coach Tim Grgurich made sure
he didn’t get away with it.

“That’s just a ridiculous state-
ment,” Grgurich said. “That kind
of ,blew my ‘mind. I've been in
places where they put the band
behind our bench, and played for
40 minutes.”

Another sure-to-be-seen occur-
rance at a Pitt-Duquesne game is
the near-ﬁght. Pitt enforcer Wayne
Talbott didn’t like the way some
Dukes were behaving, and made
sure they knew he was upset.
Talbott moved so close to Ronnie
Dixon to express his displeasure
that the Dukes’ freshman probably
found out what Talbott ate for
dinner.

Much of the player-talking and
crowd-jerring centered on B.B.
Flenory, Duquesne's flashy sopho-
more guard. When Pitt last saw
Flenory. he was on his knees
dribbling late in his team’s earlier
romp over the Panthers. Flenory
played well Wednesday. scoring a
game—high 22 points. and the
closest he came to hotdogging was
at the concession stand he passed
on his way to the locker room. Still.
he managed some pushing with
Panther Pete Strickland late in the
game.

“There was a lot of talking in the
game. and luckily tonight it didn't
fire up.” Strickland said after
another fine performance coming

off the bench. “Everyone was
talking; I know I did some.”
Strickland, the target of a large
amount of criticism, considering
how well he has played, picked up
eight points and dished out three
assists in his reserve role. But
Strickland will continue his excel-

lent team play, and Pitt will have a 5

winning season this year and next,
due, in part, to him.

Those heavy emotions generated
by this neighborhood rivalry might
be the reason ‘Pitt-Duquesne
matchups rarely are well-played
games.

“I don’t like games with a lot of
hatred involved,” Strickland said.
“I don’t think that is what sports is
all about. You have good rivalries
like Notre Dame and UCLA. I think
we should have something like that
in this city.”

Which brings us to a final
question: Who wins the
championship and the bragging
rights that go along with it?
Assuming the two teams don’t
meet in the Eastern Eight
Tournament in March, they will
have split two meetings. Duquesne
won one game by 22 points, Pitt
won Wednesday by seven. Du-
quesne wins, right? Wrong.

“We're 15-8 and what are they,
10-15?” Strickland said. “I think
we are the better team.”

Strickland is right.

Praises Fans

Pitt athletic director Cas
Myslinski issued special praise
to the students for their conduct
at Wednesday's Pitt-Duquesne
basketball game.

“I was extremely proud ofthe
entire student body," Myslin-
ski said. “Their behavior and
language was exemplary, and
was very proud of the support
they gave our team at a time
when some universities are
having problems with crowd
control. Our student body
showed its quality."

  Pantherettes conclude Season with win,

my’

- -4’



By CINDY NATALI
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women gymnasts topped
Indiana University and Youngs-
town State in their season’s ﬁnal
meet at Trees Hall Tuesday night.
The Pantherettes’ 140.1 points,
their second highest total of the
season, overwhelmed Indiana's
103.45 and Youngstown’s 104.3.

Pitt ﬁnished the season with a
6-3 record and is ranked fourth in
the East and 13th nationally.

“We set our goal at 139 or 140
because we needed the points for

our season average,” said coach
Donna DeMarino.
DeMarino said that it was

difficult for Pitt to get excited for

the meet because the opposition _

did not present a challenge.

“I was really pleased that they
had enough self-control and self-
discipline to push themselves in a
situation like that,” she said.

The Pantherettes

with 69.95 points at the break. A
new team record was set in the
uneven parallel bars at 34.85, and
Pitt tied its 35.1 vaulting record.

DeMarino attributed the suc-
cessful effort in vaulting to
performances by senior Cyndee
Severyn and Debbie Wartenberg.

  Women Wrack Scots

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pantherette basketball
team’s expected nerve-wracking
showdown with Edinboro wasn’t
the nailbiter everyone anticipated,
as Pitt upped its record to 13-10
with a 80-64 romp over the Lady
Scots Wednesday at the Field
House. '

“Our chances of getting a bid to
the Regional Tournament now are
excellent,” Pantherette coach Jean
Balthaser said. “With this win and
the victory over St. Joseph’s, it
would be hard for us to be
overlooked.”

One player who couldn’t be
overlooked in the game was Wanda
Randolph. In 31 minutes, the
6-3 center notched 22 points, 21
rebounds, and also blocked nine
shots.

_“Wanda rejected nearly every
shot that Edinboro tried to take,”
said Balthaser. “She completely

controlled the boards.” ~-

In the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the
game, the Pantherettes played
outstanding defense, and, with
Debbie Lewis at the helm, turned
on a fast-breaking running game.
The ﬂashy 5-2 guard scored 22
points. The Pantherettes led,
39-22, at the half.

In the second half, Edinboro
switched to a zone defense, but
Robin Fry hit a pair of jumpers to
put the gameicompletely out of
reach for the Lady Scots.

Stephanie Stripling hit some key
corner shots for the Pantherettes.
The junior from Montezuma, Iowa
had 14‘ points on the night.

“Edinboro is a better shooting
ballclub than they showed to-
night,” said Balthaser. “I guess
our defense intimidated them from
the beginning.”

If the Pantherettes get a
tournament bid and intimidate
teams like they did Wednesday
night, they should be in for some
exciting post-season play.

landed top places in the all-around
competition wth 36.75 and 35.70
points, respectively. Allison Ho-
burg achieved her season-high
mark in ﬂoor exercises with 8.4.

Two Pitt competitors made their
debut in the meet. According to
DeMarino, Ginny Baskin “did a
really nice job” in vaulting, beam
and floor exercise, while Jill Morris
tallied ﬁne scores after being
sidelined all season with elbow
problems and a broken foot.

DeMarino said she is looking for
Pitt’s ranking to rise in national
standings before the regionals in
March.

“We still have a long way to

 

go," she said. “We generally need
work in ﬁnishing routines. The
backups need more consistency.
Our beam will make or break us at
regionals. We potentially have one
of the strongest beam teams in the
East.

Beam scoring has advanced by
three points since the beginning of
the season, a more noticeable
improvement than in any other
area. DeMarino believes the beam
event is an opportunity for Pitt to
add points because most teams
possess weaknesses there.

“We should be seeded about
third or fourth in the regionals,"
DeMarino said. “If we ﬁnish where
we’re seeded, I'll be happy.”

Pitt Tracksters Play Horseshoes and End Up Fourth  

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s track team proved last
weekend that‘ coming close only
counts in horseshoes and hand
grenades by ﬁnishing within a
fraction of an inch of placing fourth
at the Central Collegiate Champ-

ionships at Eastern Michigan.

Panther Ed Taylor came close to
placing second in the 50-yard dash,
but was outleaned at the tape and
had to settle for fourth position.
This accounted for a six-point

 

 

difference in Pitt’s point total,
which was good for a sixth-place
ﬁnish out of 25 teams.

Panthers Dave McDonald and
Dan Goodyear led the squad with
second-place showings in the
three-mile run and high jump,
respectively. McDonald shaved an
incredible margin of over half a
minute off his personal best time
for three miles. His clocking of
13:46 is a new team indoor record.

Goodyear had a good meet,

clearing 6 feet 11 inches in his
event.

jumpers agreed to set the bar at 7

for the NCAA championships.

Again, he came close, but failed.
