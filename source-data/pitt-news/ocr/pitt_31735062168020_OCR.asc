SG To Establish

Complaint Committee‘

A majority of people today feel
a bit separated from their govern-
ment because they feel stymied
and overwhelmed by its size. com-
plexity. and coldness. So many

people who want to complain to’

their government usually don't
even know where to begin and end
up not even trying. Hawaii has re-
cently attacked this problem of

established a Committee on Uni-
versity Recources and Services.
The purpose of this committee is
to hear complaints and act on
them. But the committee will not

just complain. It will try to com-‘

municate and suggest ways of
!making the University environ-
ment a better place to live in.

SC Elections   Summarizedi

by DON MARBURY
I Editor-Elect
On January 23. 1970'. the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh held its Stu-

’ dent Government Election. It went

along pretty normally. The issues
had been discussed and the stu-
dents were now voting to decide
which of the candidates. Steve
Cundra’ and his United Student
Coalition party or Harris Miller
and the Student Community Union

reau of Educational Research and

was an associate of the American
Institutes for Research. where he

carried out a variety of studies in ,

learning. training and the meas-
urement of complex performance.
He joined the Pitt faculty in 1956
and has been director of the
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center since 1963.

Dr. Glaser has served as a con-
sultant to national and interna-
iional groups. including the Edu-
cational Subpanel. of the ._Pre_s_i-
dent's Science"Advisory, Commit-
tee. the Committee-.onv. n, e ’

  Uncertaiiity Limits SC Operatioits

Cundra had violated a section of
the Elections Code which prohibit-
ed any type of campaigning on
election day. The elections com-
mittee felt that the previous over-
spending charge and this new vio-
lation of the elections code was
enough to constitute Cundra’s
disqualification. '

On Feb. 5 Cundra's supporters
appealed the SGEC's decision to
Assistant Chancellor for Com-
munity Affairs Bernard Kobosky.
who turned the election question
over to a committee chosen by
both sides. After examining all
evidence and listening to argu-
ments from both sides. the ap-
pointed committee declared Steve

. Cundra the new SG president.

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

There "are other reasons for
buying beers cans than for the
purpose of_ drinking. The Fight
Against Beer Can Pollution. spon-
sored by the Duquesne Brewing
Company. is but one example.

The contest. open to all Univer-
sity students and alumni. simply
involves arranging cans from beer
or other soft drinks in an attrac-
tive and artistic manner. Contes-
tants mayuse only a minimum
amount of wiring and wood. and
the usage of paint is prohibited.

The contest. which has been
running since the last week in Jan-
uary. has been extended for an ad-
ditional two weeks. Explained

,Martie Miller. contest coordina-

tor. "Atfirst the stipulation was
that participants be at least 21.
However. since the large major-
ity of .students is under 21. the

-responses have been poor. There-

fore. the age requirement has

T been rescinded. How this will ef-

fect the number of entries. we

Throughout the past four
years at the University of Pitts-
’ ' burg, I have come to realize
 .. how all alone people are. And
, how all alive people will contin-
-- rue to be. It’s kind of sad be-
cause it’s the kind of a thing
that can’t be overcome.
« It’s like fighting the system.

‘S An impossibility. What or who
‘ the target is, no-one really
knows. And so where do you
start to fight. And, in fact,
. when do you start.

I get the idea, I never really
started the fight to overcome
loneliness until the past few
y years. Not consciously. I
V ’- mean, sure, even a baby who
hasn’t yet learned to walk
knows when to cry. And I al-
ways needed parental approv-
‘ al, and friends, and yeah-the
A all-important A on the report
card. ’ ‘

BUT LIFE has been a series
» of constant frustrations. Even
during the supposed good times.
' Always that need for approval.
Always that fear of rejection.
Always. And without any un-
derstanding of what I was go-
ing through, and of what was
happening around me.

Things haven’t'changed
much. There’s still that same
fight. The only difference is
that I am more aware of my-
self and what I am. And where
I stand on Motha Earth.

The Road Not Taken that’s to
v to come. Possibly. Improbab-
 ~ly. What you chose to do, or
where you chose to go, comes
to much thesame thing in terms
‘ of the fight.
WHATEVER I experience
will always be no more than or
no less than whatever I experi-
ence. The happy feelings I feel

will be mine alone. And the
sadness. Only I can experience
totally what I experience. No
one else. They can try. They
can even come close. But ever
distance is not near. *

And it’s a damned lonely
feeling. And while I’m fighting
that, I have but another fight.
Like Mersault. Or the Midnight

Cowboy. How can you live in -

your own skin, and yet live
with others? The daily para-
dox}

People say they want free-
dom. That all important goal.
People fight wars over it, and
march. They sit-in. But those
groups things don’t seem to be
the answer. There will always
be people who allow them-
selves to be drafted. And there
will always be people who'll
wear what they don’t want to
wear, or say what they don’t
want to. say — and for free-
dom? Like filling out Conscien-
tious Objector forms. Or wear-
ing the coat and tie for a high-
paying job that will allow them
to travel or “live the good life.”
Or telling some girl how won-
derful she is in order to go to
bed with her.

PEOPLE don’t really want

freedom. Because freedom is

living alone. All alone. With the
approval of no-one. And with
nothing other than your own
goddam body.

So, yeah. In that sense, I
guess I don’t want freedom.
Even though I do. And making
money, or achieving fame.

-Creating. You name it. That

means nothing to me. And so
after four years in this aca-
demic community, I have no
particular goals at the mo-
ment. Don’t know what I want
to do, where I want to go, and
when. I just don’t want to be all
alone. . . . But I will be.

One of our most serious socio-
medical problems. abortion. has
finally come to the fore and can no
longer be ignored unless we are
willing to anesthetize ourselves to
the present needs of our society.

Restrictive. archaic abortion
statutes which are rooted in reli-
gious coercion. social hypocrisy.
and an evasion of reality. still ex-
ist in every state. except Hawaii.
In coming to grips with the abor-
tion problem. one must be aware
of the evidence which speaks in
favor of the legalization of abor-
tion:

1. In affect, the laws which make
the performance of an abortion

a felony, only force the wom-

    
 
 
     
  
  
 
   
 
 
    
    

 

  The   Conse

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

In the last issue of The Pitt
News, an observor's analysis was
offered on the Student Govern-
ment elections crisis. The role of
of the Elections Committee was
examined and the conclusion was
drawn that it is in its jurisdiction
to unseat President—elect Cundra
under the SG Constitution by-laws.

This installment of the analysis
intends . to deal with‘ the conse-
quences of such a decision. ,

THE FIRST THING that must
be clarified is the status of Harris
Miller. defeated presidential can-
didate. Miller would not assume
the presidential position: the Con-
stitution is explicit on that point.

The committee ' could legally
schedule a third election. but this
is an unlikely possibility.

. There is a chance. however. that

a decision to dethrone Cundra may

be appealed beyond the University
Review Borad (which is the last
appeal for any decision involving
students within the school). '

JOHN CAVALUCHY, sokes-
man and campaign manager -for
Steve Cundra submitted two arti-
cles to The Pitt News, on Feb. 11
and March 4 dealing with estab-
lished civil resolutions to past
elections conflicts.

The suggestion was made that.
in accordance with such cases as
The US vs. Adam Clayton Powell,
the legislative body to which Cun-
dra-was elected has the power to
decide ‘his fate. The newly-elected
SG Senate consists of 15 USC sen-

ators as opposedto 10 SCU. It .

would probably elect Cundra.
HOWEVER, if the SGEC re-
fuses to give over the decision to
the Senate. the implication (at
least to this writer) is that the

I case willbe taken outside the Uni— ‘
--~V§FS.itV~7S_..—j!1I‘i_$§1iction '

an to seek a “back-door” abor-
tion through illegal channels.

It is a conservative "guessti-
-mate" of experts that at least one
million illegal abortions are per-
formed annually in the U.S. Ob-
viously. there are no health stan-
dards regulating such abortions.
thus causing many women to risk
their lives at the hands of defrock—
ed physicians. med school drop
outs. "nurses." and other gross
incompetents.

2. The restrictive statues a re
highly discriminatory.

The woman with enough money.
knowledge. and sophistication.
may seek an abortion abroad or in
another state: if she resides in a
state where a "reform" law is in
operation. she will probably be

The consequences of such a
move portends only bad news for
the reputation and future of stu-
dent self-government on this cam-
pus. It also opens the door to fur-
ther outside interference in the in-
ternal workings of the University. '

IT WILL PROVE to people like
Senator Fleming (who proposed a
bill last year which would allow-
law enforcement officers to inter-
fere in campus affairs) that the
students cannot handle their own
problems. , - '

It furthermore infers that Stu-
dent Government here has the

same. structure and significance _

as the federal government and is
therefore subject to the same rul-
ings. ‘
However. no local. state or fed-
eral election is subject to an ex-
penditure ceiling as on this cam-
pus. although in the past. candi-
dates have revealed their cam-
paign expenses for political rea-
sons. ‘

IN ADDITION, there is» little‘
parallel between the functions and '

powers and of the federal and
state legislatures and the Student

‘Government Senate. The Senate

could hardly declare war on an-
other University or levy and en-
force taxation on the whole of the
-University community.

The very presence of the Elec-
tions Committee which functions
outside of the Senate underlines
the differences in power distribu-
tion. Election disputes are han-
dled within the internal structure
of the civil legislative bodies as
they appear: there is no "external
structure“ such as an elections
committee. A »

AS IT LOOKS, no one could pre-
vent this action from taking place.
except_the student initiators of it.

But there may be a solutionlto

able to pay a team of psychiatrists
to attest for the need of the abor-
tion. The poverty stricken woman.
who may be desperately in need
of the abortion will have no alter-
native. but to self-induce the abor-
tion. or to have one performed by
an inexpensive butcher. Such dis-
crimination is clearly in viola-
tion of the 14th Amendment.

3. A restrictive statute is clearly

unconstitutional on 0 t h e r
grounds too:

at It denies women the right to

decide when they wish to bear '

children.

b) The law denies the physician
the right to treat his patient in ac-
cordance with his medical know-
ledge.

C) There is no compelling state
interest strong enough to prohibit
the performance of abortions by
licensed physicians.

d) The statute is clearly the pro-
duct of religious pressure groups.
thus violating the First Amend-
ment.

4. The population explosion and
the fact that the U.S. popula-
tion threatens to reach 300 mil-
lion by the year 2000, clearly

indicate that abortions must be ;

be an auxiliary means of popu-
lation control.

We have already seen too many
cases of child abuse. deprivation
dwarfism. and ruthless neglect. in
the unwanted child.

diate and .crucial issue if those

with the foresight and power take
advantage of it.

It is apparent that Student Gov-
ernment has not been performing
any significant role beyond that

— of scheduling and funding social
‘ affairs. A large part of the prob-

lem involves structure; the rest
involves attitude.

‘NOW THAT the University Sen-
ate has offered real voting power
to students on important decision-
making committees; s t u d e n ts
have real potential for influence
in the affairs of the University. ,

More than that. for the first
time. unity of faculty, administra-
tion and students-may be achiev-
ed.

The only viable answer is the
calling of a constitutional conven-
tion to dissolve the present. non-
negotiable structure of Student
Government and incorporate into
any self-government proposal the
University committee seats. I

THE SG Restructuring Commit-
ttee. which has been meeting since

1 January under the chairmanship

of Sy Adler. has proposed a ,sys_-
tem of self—governance that may
answer the questions. ~

The ‘plan which involves the
election of student representatives

directly to the University‘ Senate

seats available portrays a real,
recogni-tion of the potential pow-
er students can exert. I

\

It would be an apprecialbe step
towards the achievement of com-
munity governance.

Implementation of the restruc-
turing ideas demands an '.'open'
hearing." a constitutional conven-
tion that would legitimize“ them.

A Reader Writes
Edit0r’s F irml Gripes
Leave Her Cold

Editor. The Pitt News:

The editorial in the March 4
Pitt News (“Peering to the Fu-
ture" by Dave Tiernani presents

. an interesting paradox.
After a year of stressing social‘

justice and minority equality es-
pecially for the poor and the black
(admirable motives with which I
agree). you contradict yourself
and overlook the necessity of a
low cost but quality education for
Pennsylvania students who can
barely afford Pitt's $800 tuition.
let alone the costs of going out of
state. '

Youwritez‘ "When the Univer-
sity became state related it gave a
lot up in out-of-state students."
It’s the leaving home . . that
makes out of staters more aware
than the home town folks." ‘'1 pre-
dict the decline of -not only Pitt but
every university in the country
that accommodates local students
with second rate education with
state funds."

The preceding excerpts seem to A
present several misconceptions.
First you neglect that fact that the
University must have felt they
could gain financiallyand needed

to by going state related or Idoubt '

they would have done.

Secondly you seem to general-

__ ize (i.e.. out of staters are more

“aware" therefore better. Local
students having nothing to offer
and no experiences _to relate.
Therefore. local students will lead
to the.,decline of the University.)
How ridiculous. '

 

Early in the article you wrote:
“Well if you happen to have been
born on the right side of the tracks
then this is a wonderful country.
But what about the rest? Don't
they count?"

Well. you'll never know if you
really believe the University
should attract affluentmiddle and
upper income students from out
of state rather than recognize
promising local students who
can't afford out of state tuitions.

You conclude the whole state
related vs. out-of-state discussion
by stating. "The whole concept
only perpetrates the idea of going
to college to get a degree or a
husband rather than an educa-
tion." -

I disagree. The low income stu-
dent who really wants an "educa-

tion" realizes early that they are ‘
forced to choose the best but low-'

est priced college they can find
and learn to like it.

Even bathing every day
can’t stop it.

Feminine odor starts inter-
nally, and no amount of bath-

ing can remove it. Soap and

water simply can’t reach the

area where the odor starts.
That’s the reason you need

Norforms®. . . the second deodor-
ant?‘ These tiny internal sup-

positories kill germs—stop odor

effectively yet safely. In fact, gen-

tle, doctor—tested Norforms are
so safe and easy to use, you can

use them as often as necessary.

No bath or shower can give

 Wrestlers Drop Close

 

  

Monday, March 9, l970—THE PITT Ni3ws——Page 9

One to Army

by MIKE MILLER"
The wrestlers ended their season with a 10-4 record after
losing a close match to Army Saturday, 19-16.

The matmen were leading right up to the heavyweight
match with a score of 16-14. but Army’s Curt Meyer pinned Willie Sal-
oky in 3:01. to give the Cadets their five points.

Coach Dave Adams attributed the loss to the lack of aggressive-

ness on the part of the team.

“They weren’t aggressive all
the way through,” he said. “They
tried to get aggressive at the end
but you have to be aggressive
from the beginning to win.”

“Wylie had a bad match,” stat-
ed Adams. “He didn’t wrestle the
way he had been. Schrif should
have won (at 167). Young tied but
I feel he should have won.”

H‘ Adams considered the decisive Pitt started the match off well

and he had also defeated Snyder
earlier in the tournament.

Weiss also went" straight
through all tournament matches
without a loss, and like Ross, he
defeated a Penn State grappler in
the finals. Weiss decisioned Fli-
pos, 7-1, to gain the crown.

After losing to Navy‘s Salman in
an early round. Caramanna came
back to defeat the same opponent
in the finals of the 190 pound
bracket. 4-3. Caramanna saw ac-
tion with the varsity this season

ten picked up points with an es-

cape. two take downs. a near fall _

and one point for riding time.

Bill MacBeth won a 6-4 deci-
sion over Bud Smeltz, at 150.

l Smeltz had two reversals while
‘ MacBeth had two escapes and two

take downs.

The Eastern Championships
will be held at Penn State next Sat-
urday. Adams feels that the two
recent losses will have little ef-
fect on the grapplers performance.

FRESHMAN Randy Payne brought home three trophies from the Navy
Plebe Tournament Saturday as he was named champion in the 126
pound class, most outstanding wrestlerjn the tourney and was awarded

as a heavyweight but according to

Tom Hays Eager For Easterns

 As 9 Mermen F ly To Dartmouth I

    

by JERRY MYERS

Tommy Hayes. sophomore
freestyle sprinter from New
Kensington. joins eight Pitt
mermen as they prepare to tackle
the Eastern Championships at
Dartmouth this Thursday. A

The Easterns. an invitational

‘tournament sponsored by the Ivy

League. is scheduled to run

"through Saturday and will feature
almost 30 schools from the East
coast and inland.

MAES
Eastern Hopeful

Why her
daughter was
taught religfion
-without a
catechisin  

She asked, “Mother, how do

. you know that’s what God

wants?”~ And her mother
said, “I don’t know for sure.
And I don’t think anyone
does. Butias we learn more.
and more, we ﬁnd that every
man everywhere, religious
or not, rich or. poor, ‘good or
bad,'has a part of the truth

in him.” So Alice’s_.dauighter 

learned_ that not all answers
.can be recited from memory,‘
but that to ‘men who will '
open their minds and hearts, _
the truth is constantly being
revealed.

“I’ll tell you
what I believe. . ; ” ,

is often heard among
Quakers, for we do not all
believe‘ alike. Because we._ .
feel that each man can fol-
low what the inner_ light.
shows him, we have no inﬂex-
ible creeds oristatements of
‘belief. All men can be seekers"
—and potential ﬁnders.

Are youiinterested in a reli-
gion that.follows no dogma or
formula? . Would you like to
explore the approach of the
Friends? If so, we havesome
free and quite readable leaﬂets.

Hayes is looking forward to this
year's championships. According
to Tommy. "This year Yale is in-
eligible and they wiped up last
year. They had three guys in every
event and .they won everything.
This year we have a much better
chancef'

,Tommy will get another shot at
a boy he swam against in the Syra-
cuse _meet. “I’ll be swimming
against him in the 50. He ‘swam
the 100 against us and I did next to
my best time in that meet so I’m
really looking’ forward to that
race.

easily beats the qualifying time of
23.0 in the 50 yard freestyle. and
he also qualified for the 100 yard
freestyle. The qualifying time for
that event is 50.0.

Tommy is strictly a sprinter
and as he says himself. "My bread
and butter is the 50. I‘ve gone the
individual medley but I don‘t like

Hayes, fastest time of 122.4‘

it. The longest I've swum is the
200 but I don't like that too much
either.“ The sophomore freestyler
will probably compete in three
events this week including the 50.
the 100 and the 400 freestyle relay.

Hailing from the same high

school as distanceman Rick Rowe,

Tommy was recruited by ex-as-
sistant swimming coach Jerry
Snyder, back in 1968. Tommy

-has come along to consistantly

post wins in the 50 yard freesyle
event all season. A bruised foot
hampered ,his,turns and his all-
around swimming at the begin-
ning of the. 1970’ season, but by
mid-January, he was in winning
form. ‘

Tommy is. confident that by
next year he’ll have a good shot at
qualifying for the National Cham-
pionships as well as the E-ast-erns.
The Nationals” qualifying time is

:21.9. Along with Tommy Hayes._
the other mermen tackling the A

Easterns are: Al Morris."Fred
Lewis. Mark Cohen. Jim Hughes.
Rick Rowe. Dave Anderson. Dave
Wessel. and Chet Zientek.

In the last few years business has
changed as.m_uch as skirt lengths. So
has the work of the CPA.

Today the CPA helps solve a host
of problems rising from new technol-
ogy (including the computer) and the- .
changing social scene.

He must be able to develop and
interpret a wide range of economic
data as a basis for decision-making
and corporate planning. _

If you are a creative thinker, with
a strong analytical ability, account-
ancy may be the profession for you.

You might join an independent
accounting firm, serving a varied list
of clients, perhaps becoming a part-
ner eventually. Or you might start

‘your own practice.

Or you might become a key man
on the management team of a busi-
ness, or join a non-profit enterprise,
or work in education or government.

What other profession offers so
many choices? Talk with your faculty

advisor or. . . A
