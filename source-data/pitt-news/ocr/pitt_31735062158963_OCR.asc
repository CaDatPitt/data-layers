‘down thev.-"aisle ‘and slipped into
their seats. It v~.*a's too much for
the conductor. He cursed in his
own private language, jumped off
the podium and stalked backstage.
After an interval, he came out
upon the stage and ﬁnished the
remainder of the concert without
interruption. _

Receptive Audience
To this writer, this act seemed
to be an inexcusable show of tem-
per, something that Went out with
-the fat prima’-donnas of the pre-
war era. In the first place, I have
never heard a more receptive au-
‘dience. Itwas absolutely silent as
it listened to the incomparable
music of Mozart. To have Dr.
Koussevitzky ‘break up this mood
with his tantrums seemed bad
taste. .9
The audience is much worse in
Boston. if we may judge from
radio broadcasts ‘ id newspaper
reportis. During W last Easter
broadcast qggthe ‘Bbston orchestra
when, .il§ach’s “Saint Matthew’s
P’assion"’ was given, the coughing
and shuffling of the audience was
very distracting. But Dr. Kons-
sevitzky finished the program.
The summer concerts of the Bos-
ton Pop Orchestra sound more
like World Series games do than
concerts by the world's greatest
symphony orchestra. Brahms,
Beethoven and Bach have ' the

dubious accompaniment of an au- 3 last in a._ series (if, voc-..a.tional§

dience chattering’ and drinking,
children playing hide and seek
amongjthe tables, while at fairly
regular intervals a locomotive
whistle rounds out the program.
Noisy Recording

The Boston orchestra has also
made recordings of compositions in
their concert hall. whenfan actual
program was in progress. "A re-
viewer of the New“York4 Times,
writing for his Sunday column,
mentioned the fact thatlithe re-
cording was excellent, except that
the audience’ noises ‘could be heard
above the music. , iv

 Vitamin

By. IRVA KAUFMAN A
Was it Dr. Charles Glen lV{_ing,
professor of chemistry, together
with W. A. Waugh, of the Univer-
''sity, or Albert Von Szent-Gyorgyi

 

"recipient of the 1937 Nobel Prize

‘for Physiology and Medicine, who
identified vitamin ‘C?

A discussion by Gerald J. Cox
of Mellon Institute, on this much
disputed question is found in the
December 10 issue of Science, a
‘.“week1y journal devoted to the
,advancement of Science.”

STATEMENT ERRONEOUS

In the article, which deals with-
the highly technical phasesof that
problem im’olved in the claims of
priority, Mr. Coxstates, “numer-
ous careless or erroneous state-
ments have appeared in scientiﬁc
journals, reviews and books and
in lay publications, which tend, to
obscure the priority of Dr. C. C.
King and W. A. Waugh, of the
University of Pittsburgh, in estab-
lishing the identity of vitamin C

_Vwith a pure crystalline substance.”

To prove his point, Mr. Cox,
who holds a nutrition fellowship in

lr1IiiisljArticl

-C7Isolatio'n

A_

the Buhl’ Foundation, draws up a
chronological order ofthe events
‘dealing with the ‘question. V’This
chronology shows that, (1') ‘_‘On
April 1, 1932, as a culmination of
a series of studies ‘concerned di-
rectly with vitamin C, King and
‘Waugh announced the isolation of
‘vitamin C in crystalline form,”
and that (2) “it was not until May
7, 1932, that they (Svirbely, and
Szent-Gyorgyi) stated that ‘Vita-
min C is a single substance . . .’ ”
MAKES A‘WARD CLEAR"

claims, Mr. Cox points out ayital.
fact that must be recognized when
he says, “The well-merited award
to Albert Von Szent-Gyorgyi of the
1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine ‘for his discovery of, the
biological processes of oxidation
with special regard to vitamin C
and thefumaric acid catalyses’ is}
erroneously interpreted_ in. many
quarters solely as an'award"'for
the identiﬁcation of vitamin C.

Oh, there are souls of beauty, souls that climb
above the commonplace vulgarities,
for there are dreamers who consider time
an intermission in eternal peace, ’
for there are aesthetcs, living in the light
of amber stars and opalescent moon,»
for there are lovers who consider night
a warm and fragile, gentlycoaxing tune.

But in their search for realism’s ﬂame,
contemporaries seek a sordid theme,

and ﬁnd in sordidness a noble aim,

and stolidly reject the dreamer-’s dream.

Perhaps they're right, perhaps their thoughts lie
deep,
perhaps thei-e’sv beauty in a garbage heap.

Such arguments may be Illultl-I
plied ad inﬁnitum. But in every
case, they may be traced ultimate-
ly to the fact that the general run 
of American enterprisers is un-
willing to revise its estimates of
a fair margin of profit. Instead.
of looking forward to the day
when an economic collapse may
witness the elimination of the;7
proﬁt system in this country, they
prefer to hasten that collapse by
looking constantly backward to
the days when ten or eleven per-
cent was only a fair return.

Only when American capital
realizes that proﬁt margins must
be adjusted to the changing eco-
nomic situation will a genuine
prosperity become a reality in this
country. This alternative is 
fundamental change in our po-I
litical and economic setup.

Letter;

Editor, The Pitt News:

We, as fraternity women, re-
volt at the idea of cutting out the
Fraternity column. After all,
there is‘ :1 huge representation of
such members on campus and we
deserve a column for our activ-
ities.

The inclusion of “Frai.ernity
News" in the “Sociali‘texns" col-
umn condenses the _ material to
“cut and dried" stuff that moves
of little interest to non—frai;ei‘iii_ty
people.

It is not only our opinion on
the subject; but is that of many
other frat members. In hope that
News" makes a
speedy return we are,

Ediz’to‘r’s Note: “Social-ite‘ms”
column -is not inrtendcd to reduce
fraternity news to “cut and dried”
stuff. Its purpose is to distribute
such news along witlz notes on
otlze-7' social events during the en-
tire week: at the particular time
that the items are timely. Rather
than discri‘minatio»n., it is a plan
which will encourage more non-
fraterlnrity people to become ac-
quai-nted with the work of frater-
m'.tics because non-fraternity peo-
ple 'noto'ri.ou.sly do not read items
labeled “Fraternity News.”

I say reduced to it, for usually

the fundamental idea of popular-%

izing telepathy, but for the idiocy
of the staff of writers and tech-
nicians that turned the Whole
thing into a kind of rareiﬁed chil-
drcn’s show.

Now, I like drama when it’s
good clean stuff, and many of the
incidents presented on this pro-
gram are dramatic and reasona-
ble. But I don’t like the air of
deepest mystery in which they
veil their facts.

One particular gripe is their
“What is it?” theme.

says hollowly,
“What is it?" From a distance
comes the even more hollow
echo, “What is it?”

This is, I believe, intended to
signify telepathy and to provoke
some sort of emotion in one_-—cu-
riosity, perhaps, or awe. I think
it ‘sounds like The Shadow, or
maybe, “The Professor Died at
Midnight.”

Maybe in the ﬁrst place, I
shouldn't have listened to it with
the idea of getting much of a
scientiﬁctheory out of it. After
all, telepathy isn't yet, a science.
And if they mean by their pro-
gram only to get the mass of
radio-listening public interested
in telepathy, then perhaps they’re
right. Perhaps some people like
it. Personally, I resent their at-
titude of talking down, of making
a puppet show for the ediﬁcation
of the little ones, when the mate-
rial calls for maturity of handling.

Well, that's my squawk. There,
is, of course, a good side to the
program. They present tests
which are fun to play around
with, and these sponsors are the
first to touch this mental dyna-
mite. So maybe they arcn’t all
head-patters.

But it is interesting a.nd unique

young man could get such perfect

and‘ ancient isloops ride waves that
would make the Queen Mary turn

Interviews

BY Messemﬁ arAd~Akse1md

Behind every man’s success is
a woman-——and if Sherman Pasc-
koff, C38, succeeds. _.in_ ._ winning
the first prize in'Wilkins’ Ama-
teur House last Sunday he can
thank Melva Makrauier, C40.

“I gottiredv of hearing him ba-
ba-ba-boo.,' so I sent him down to
W~'rlkins',’«?  said-:=; I Melvas‘ ~ ’ “lids a"
peach of a fellow, and a peach
of a singer.’.’ ‘ e .

Melva. has other hobbies be-
sides backing talent. She likes ice-

Sunday School. She’s a phys. ed.
major at the “University, and
thinks she's the “strong, silent
type,” which is the opinion of
any phys. ed. major.

Anything you want to tell us
about? Yes! “I have three broth-
ers,” said Melva, “a doctor, a
lawyer, and an Indian————’twelve
years old.” Evidently the Indian
is cause enough for -conversation.
Favorites? “Helen Hayes, ’cause
shc’s a wonderful actress, and
Bing Crosby, ’cause he's a croon-

It has been diseoyeredothat ten
Pitt playershave received this
recognition now that the last team
has been selected. Thus Pitt has
an All-American fullback, half-
back, quarterback, center, end,
tackle, and guard, which is one
pretty good explanation for th.e
success of Dr.‘ Sutherland’s squad.

These ten players were selected
on thirteen difirerent teams, cov-
ering every Ali.-American chosen
by a publication of national sig-
nificance. Of these thirteen dif-

ally “every university in the
coIIntry,j" Joseph C.’ Trees, ’95,
"former Pitt football star, key-
noted the a.nnu,a:l testimonial din-
ner to the Panther gridiron team
given by the Varsity Letter Club
in the Hotel Schcnley Monday ev-
ening.
NO APOLOGY

“There is nothing for which to
‘apologize, nothing to be ashamed
of in athletic subsidies,” said the
Itoastmaster, who is a member of

‘letic council.

“I can speak. I was the first
,‘subsidized player who ever wore
;a Pitt Iiiiiforin. I am glad of the
iexchange, of which I got the bet-
iter. Whatever success I have at-
ltainecl. I can trace directly to my
‘subsidization,” remarked Trees,
,now a prominent oil tycoon.

' Over 500 Pitt alumni were pres-
‘ent at the dinner at which time
the Panthers were officially ack-
nowledged to be the local, East-
ern, and national football cham-
pions. Three trophies were pre-
sented to Captain Johnny Michel-
osen signifying these honors.

TROPHIES PRESENTED

Victor A. Lambert, co-donor of
the August V. Lambert trophy
representing Eastern gridiron su-
premacy, presented the trophy to
the Panthers in the beginning‘ of
the program, part of which was
broadcast over a national net-
work.

Mayor Cornelius D. Scully en-
gaged in repartee with O. K. Ea-
ton, chairman of the Duquesne
athletic board, as he presented the
new city cup to Pitt. Permitted
to unveil the new trophy in what
Scully characterized as a “strip-
tease act,” Eaton handed the cup
over to Michelosen. Eaton was
given this privilege because of the
fact that Duquesne had won it
last year, but had never acquired
possession of it due to the delay
in production.

DALLENBACK TALKS

Guest speaker of the evening

was Dr. Karl Dallenback, guard of
Pitt’s undefeated 1910 team and
at present associate professor of
psychology at Cornell. He com-
plimented the '37 varsity by tell-
ing them that they were as good as
his team and also told them of
.the penalties of leadership.
,l “I’m satisfied,” said Dr. Jock
gsutherland in reference to the
past season. Describing his team
as a "grand bunch of boys,”
Sutherland stated that he was
now interested in how they were
preparing for their semester ex-
ams. _

James Potts, freshman track
coach, recently fulﬁlled a promise
——a little pressure had to be ap-
plied, but -he did his duty!

Before the freshman cross-
country run between the Penn
State and the Pitt frosh, Potts
tried to whip his harriers into a
bit of a furore and frenzy.

In the heat of the moment his
§..0I.1gl1e slipped and he promised
the boysa turkey dinner if they
succeeded in beating the Penn
State boys, and wound up with an
undefeated season. They beat the
Penn State boys, and wound up
with an undefeated season.

Potts forgot all about the turkey
dinner and casually ignored all in-
nucndo about dinners that his
freshmen boys tossed around.
Finally they got quite blunt and
put the question to him.-

Social note: Last Sunday eve-
ning Mr. James Potts, of Edge-
wood, entertained Mr. Walter
Sterner, Mr. Al Boulanger, Mr.
Paul Roelen, Mr. Bill Nurmi, Mr.
Frank McKay, and Mr. Al Amer-
man. Turkey was served, and
Mr. Carl Olson spoke. The turkey
was good.

Apple,” has organized a “Big

Pierce will show his proteges

ambition is extiaordinary. He
not only acts as the Pitt Panth-

teams and attends med school,
but works at the Faculty Club,
and mellows his horse—play by
assisting a funeral director in
the evenings. For relaxation

Forum Monday at its second meet-
ing on the labor question, Mr. W il-
-liams assailed .CIO 01.‘:-Zétnization
A-and mem_ber"sh’ifp- policies, and fide-

clared his faith in the AFL craft

union as the best and most endur-

ing type of labor organization.
A “I pleaded with William Green,

the last time I spoke with him,

not to settle this ﬁght with the

CIO. If I have anything to say

in the AFL, it'll be ﬁve, ten, or 15

years before we make peace. Now

that they’ve left us, I want to
leave them alone long enough to
see what they can do,” said Mr.

Williams.

SHOULD BE SELECTIVE
Membership in AFL craft
unions rests upon ability and
training in some particular trade,
and provides a secure basis for in-
terest in the union, he claimed.

Giving recognition to workers for

the experience they have gained

in their craft is the best basis for

union membership, he continued.
“I doubt very much whether the

strategy of signing members into

a union without an initiation fee, '

just to compete with a company
union which is doing the same
thing, will build up lasting unions.
We must make the workers under-
stand that they must bear respon-
sibility if thejunion is to live,” de-
clared Mr. VVilliams.

“I don’t believe that the the-
atrical method _of some organizers
is the kind that brings lasting or-
ganization. But, I don’t believe
that because there is a group try-
ing to get members in that way
that they will kill the labor move-
ment.  . .  

RIGHT .VVILL WIN

“If the ‘CIO idea is correct,
they’re going to continue to live.
If they’re not, when the United
Mine Workers, Iron, Steel, and
Tin Workers, and Ladies’ Garment
Workers stop paying ' dues.r the
CIO organizers will be laid off and
their membership will disappear,”
he stated. ' — , '

UNUSUAL POLITICS

Quite unfamiliar to the usual

tailed accounts which followed
afterwards. Mr. McDonald re-
fused to question Mr. Thompsoirs
right to become judge. But Mr.
Thompson refused to ignore the
revelation. He told party leaders
of his intention to decline the of-
ﬁce. .
It took a good deal of convinc-
ing on their part, together with a
personal plea of Mr. McDonald to
change his mind.

STILL UNCERTAIN

Democratic party leaders pointed
out to him the uncertainty even
now connected with the judgeship
race winner. As one man put it:
“There’s no way of telling whether
Mr. Thompson was given the total
vote, cast forhim as the result of

similar defects in other machines.
In a race so close,«where a hun-
rdred ..or less votes separate the

winner and loser, out of a total of
