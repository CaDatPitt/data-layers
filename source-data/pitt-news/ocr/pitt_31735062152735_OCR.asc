Several‘ events of interest concerning
student government have come up
within the past week. Class meetings
in all but the senior class have been
held», at which the matter was dis-
cussed. , ,  ’
"At the.-meeting ofthe junior class
presided over by R. L. ‘Huff, Econ. ’16,
the president, the matter of student
government was subjected to a spirited
discussion. V
the actions of the Student Board of
Control whichiwas published last week
sass jread; ,«E0:l10W‘Ing"i.1‘1°l'S,’ J. &""G(?r”VV,
Col; ’16, presented a resolution favor-
ing . a constitutional convention to
consider recasting student government
and authorizing the appointment of
a committee to represent the junior
class‘ should such a convention be
called. R. L. Spence, Col. '16, second-
ed the motion to pass the resolution.-

After further‘ discussion pro and con
the resolution was adopted and, the

following committee has been appoint-
ed»:  M. Gould,” chairman ;B.' M.

1 Selekgman, and,‘ Miss Helene Reed.

In ,the sophomore. class meeting a

.similar resolution was passed and

president, Welsh has appointed the
following ‘ coin-mittee: Geo. Ketchum,
chairman; Wm. »Ar.thur and L. G.

a lack of_ data on the subject the
matter was postponed until a future
meeting. ' ~ '

A long“ article on “Pitt Student
Pol.itics~,{’ which appeared in one of the
Pittsburigh dailies Wednesday has
received considerable student com-
ment. Neither side in question will.
-admit responsibility for the article. ~

The resolution, as passed in the
junior and a substantially similar one
in the sophomore class follows:.

Resolved: That it_is the will of the

convention be held for the purpose"
or reorganizing student government
in the University of Pittsburgh on a
more eﬁicient basis, that action tending
towards such revision should come
from the student body as a whole,
and that a deﬁnite proposition should
be laid before the students for con-
sideration at‘ the ‘earliest, possible
time. ' “ . ,

‘ Therefore :. I move that a committe
of three members be appointed by the
president of the class to represent the
,class of 1916 in,such a convention, and

ized to confer with similar appointed
committe’esI from the other classes of
the undergraduate schools, and with
committees“ from‘ the schools of
medicine, and dentistry, and arrange
for regular. meetings of their whole
body, acting‘ as a constitutional con-
vention; .and that the presidentof this

The duti.es;of_ these advisers were
suggested, as’ being to accompany the

the affair. From now until Feb. 26,
all alumni correspondence will be sent
out in a special envelope, with an ad-

- vertisement of the Alumni Charter

Day Banquet on the face. These en-
velopes are similar to those used by
the Athletic authorities last -Fall in
advertising the home football games,
which attracted.a lot of attention.  -

There has been a complaint in the
past that those who ordered their
tickets in advance secured no advan-
tages in ‘seats over‘ the‘ alumni who
waited until the night of the banquet
and purchased their tickets ‘then. It

banquet of this kind will testify, that
reservations be made in advance, If at
all possible. Of course, there are some
who cannot . decide ﬁnally iuntil tho:

but the majority can. ‘In order to over-
come this ‘difficulty, and give the early
purchasers ﬁrst chance at the seats in.

in advance will -be of one color and
will be. admitted ﬁrst. Those sold on
the‘ night of the banquetwill be of‘
another" color and holders will be ad-
mitted only after the advance pur-
chasers have been seated. Remember
this and get your tickets in advance.

start is on Feb. 26th at" the Alumni
Charter Day Banquet. ' 

The list of speakers will be an-
nounced in the next issue of THE
WEEKLY. Several men of national
importance will‘: be on the list. J “One
man who is almost sure to come and
‘who will be asked to respond‘ to a
toast is the head of one of the largest
in the

all over the world. Charles. W. Scovel,

If Pitt" "come ' out the
-winner, the title for this part of the
State will be almost in" sight. Pitt has
already beaten Penii State, and they,
in turn, have twice» defeated W. &‘J.
Penn State’s two victories over W. &
J. practically puts the Washingtonians
out of the running. Last year the-Red

twice defeating Penn State - and by
splitting the games with Pitt. AA spec-

been aroused over this game on ac-
count of -the iﬁne work the Varsity has
been doing this season. 'The prospects
of defeating the Murphyites on their
own sod is rather alluring to’ loca,
fans and-a large turnout -is expected’.

Every student who can possibl beg,
borrow, or in some way lay his hands
on the necessary funds will and should
be there." The-total cost, including-

‘ carfare, tickets and incidentals will

not run over one dollar and a half.
The chances of beating‘W_. & J. have
never been better, and for any one
to deliberately throw away‘ a chance
tosee our old rivals bite~the dust is
nothing less -than criminal. Be there

and be there strong. _ We want this to

Some time somebody will give to
Lubic all the credit he deserves for
Pitt’s showing in basyketballx Just
now, all we have t‘ say for him is
that he covers more ground than any
other guard who has come this way

NAVYA BY EYELASH.

The meagre foot of elusive space
which separated Swope from the white
tile last -Saturday deprived the Blue
and.Gold aquatic team of victory and
‘enabled ' the Navy aggregation to
score, for the second ,time, a marginal
triumph over the Pitt delegation of
splashers by a ﬁnal score of 36-17.
It »was an odd. conincidence which
provided a pair of malicious jinxes
that -led two branches of Pitt athletics
to disaster in the two military schools
of the «country on the same day.‘ De-
spite the intimate association of the
.Annapolis men with the realm of N ep-
tune, the University aggregation
made the match one of the most sen-
sa.t.ional...;.that has been witnessed in
Maryland’s capitol this year. There
were periods during the contest when
the outcome literaly balanced between
the defenders of the Blue and_ Gold
recordand the future adinirals: 
. Captain Sweet of Pittsburgh scored
a clever victoryin the 40-yard- dash,
defeating Vail and Marshall of" Navy
in-the fast time of 40 4-5 seconds,
Buckland of Pittsburgh scored an easy
victory in the 60-yard back stroke
event, establishing-a new record of 39
‘seconds. J
New records were established in the
relay race, back stroke, and 220-yard
and 100—yard events. The summar-;
1es: ‘ .

The speaker described how the bac-

struggle to remain. a Dr. Holman told
ofthe diseases cused by the germs,
stating _that when the resistance was
very large in the body, -there is only

when the resistance is small.

‘““Tasks Awaiting Our Solution” was
the ‘subject of an informal discussion
featuring the weekly meeting of the
Young Men's Christian ‘Association,
last’ Monday morning-in Thaw hall
chapel. It had been expected that
reports would be heard as this time
from the delegation of association men
“who attended the great religious
campaign at State College, from
Thursday to Sunday of last week, J.
D‘. Stark,'_H. N. Mawhinney, B. M.
.Lawther and C. A. Wagner. .The
delegates did not reach home.in time
however, and the meeting was in
charge of K. M. Gould, ’16. The dis-
' cussion, contributed to by several
students, touched .on student and re-
‘ ligious activities and school spirit, and
helpful suggestions were developed‘
toward the amelioration of existing
religious conditions. — _

Next Monday morning -the State
College delegation will give its report,
and a strenuous meeting is expected.

into ‘ our American civilization, it is

and example, the proper instruction.
and trainingpwhich is so essential in

making useful. citizens of the other-

wise segregated, unsympathetic, law-

less and often dangerous groups of

foreigners. As an example of’ the

work done along" this line, it might

-be mentioned that in one year 3,297

first and second naturalization papers

were secured by foreigners through-

out the country, through the activity

of the Y. M. C.‘ A. and_ Indiistrial

English—sp,eaking‘ workmen are formed

in factories, where during the ‘noon

hour or in the evening, instruction in

given in such subjects as public and

social hygiene," physiology, ﬁrst aid-
to ‘the injured, elementary natural

science, mathematics, etc. The em-I
ployers, thought at first critical, now
welcome it for its direct beneﬁt to the

" every once in a while, with the regular
classes. This is an extension-of the
Y. M. C. A. social evenings which has
proved to be of great value particular-
ly "for the foreigners’ boys as well as
men-inasmuch as it brings them in
contact with our manners, plays,
amusements and social life in general.

It also breaks the monotony of the

regular instructional classes which be-

comes rather dull and uninteresting

if they are pushed too far.

» 4. The material beneﬁt of this

work cannotbe overestimated and de-

serves at least a brief notice.

To the workmen it unveils a new
horizon. It brings him . into direct
contact, with- the nobler truer and
more democratic Americanism for
which our colleges stand and dispels
from his mind the spectres of doubt
and, suspicion which have so long
stood between him; and the educated
class. He realizes that colleges are
‘not the breedingplaces of haughty
aristocratic capitalists, but institu-
tions of learning that send forth young
men of noble .ideas and democratic
principles, who know how to handle
men squarely, fairly, without pre-
judice of race or religion orclass dis-
tinction. The sincere attitude, frank-.
nessand goodwill on the part of the
student cannot fail to win t,heW.con-

whether foreigner or native. A
To the student the work is of in-
estimablevalue. _ He comes -in con-
tact with the very soul of the working
men, learns how to handle him, ‘gets
to know how to win his conﬁde'nce—'
factors which are of primary import-
ance. in engineering management and
in all “phases, of .-life. -
The most.important function of a
university ‘is to trainleaders of men,
leaders in_ every‘ department of human
activity; and it is hard’ to conceive"
of- any other opportunity that can be
offered in a university that will serve
to prepare men for leadership better
than the industrial service work.
(Continued in next week’s issue.)

A unanimous motion_ was passed by
‘the association, -urging upon every
,member to bring another man to next
week’s meeting. The Pitt represent-
atives will endeavor to describe and
