Media program goes
for larger expansion

By Lisa R. Pugliese

Staff Writer

Nearly 20 years of success from
WQED-TV’s Media Outreach
Programwill be rewarded by an
expansion, allowing present
community—based projects to go
to the national level.

The expanded center will im-
plement and develop national as
well as local campaigns for non-
profit organizations and will also
help to assure the role of WQED
in the coordination of the out-
reach activities of the Public Tel-
evision Outreach Alliance.

The PTOA involves five Public

A Broadcasting stations including .
. WQED in Pittsburgh, and has

supported such outreach projects
as The Chemical People and
Project Literacy.

Margaret Woodwell, director
of the National Media Outreach
Center and station manager of
WQED, said, ”We are formaliz-
ing former outreach programs to

enable us to more efficiently do -

the projects.” .

Familiar programs of the Out-
reach Center include such things
as A Generation at Risk, The
Chemical People, and Project
Literacy.

Specific goals for the Media
Outreach expansion include
creating and producing multi-
media campaigns which will ad-

Commentator speaks
about nuclear freeze

By Cindy O’Leary

Staff Writer

On Monday evening, the Pitt
Chaplains’ Association presented
a lecture by the Rev. William
Sloane Jr. entitled ”Roots of
Morality, Plantings of Peace:
Common Faith and Uncommon
Politics.” -

The lecture was the second
presentation in a three-part series
funded in part with a grant from
the Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation.

Coffin’s lecture focused on the
goal of international cooperation
and a united effort toward global
peace.‘ He views nuclear weap-

ons as being dangerous in their
very production, and that when
it comes. to weaponry/’the, lan-

guage of moral prohibition is‘

dead."

Also addressed was the idea
that the planet as a whole must
be managed, and not just its
parts. Coffin feels we must
cooperate and allow the concept
of ”national security to give way
to global security” and begin to
eliminate the further production
of nuclear weaponry.

Coffin has been considered a
strong presence in peace and
civil rights movements for the

Firm researches spatial
needs of Pitt's campus

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Senior Staff Writer

A private planning consulting
firm hired by the University of
Pittsburgh to study the physical
needs of the Oakland campus has
issued its findings on Pitt's
present use of space.

The Boston-based firm Sasaki
and Associates, which Pitt hired
in August 1988 for $100,000,
found Pitt's major space
problems are inefficient use of
classroom space, lack of on-
campus housing, particularly for
freshmen, and lack of expansion
space for many university depart-
ments, according to Gordon Bug-

by, associate director of planning
and engineering for Pitt's Physi-
cal Plant.

”The classroom space wasn't
particularly complementary. We
have enough classroom space,
but it's being underutilized,”
Bugby said.

”Almost all of them [class-
rooms] are in use during the peak
hours  between the morning
and 2 and 3 in the afternoon, but
nobody wants to have classes at
odd times or teach at odd times,”
he explained.

Sasaki’s report stated Pitt's
available classroom facilities are
’’below average” compared with

Lakouchecriticizes the press

as a puppet of the government

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

Editor's Note: The following is
the second installment of a three-
part series investigating the inci-

dents and allegations surround— -

ing the conviction of political
activist Lyndon LaRouche.

Lyndon LaRouche stated that

he has been slandered by a me-

dia which is controlled by the
United States government.

In a recent interview with The
Pitt News from a county jail in
Alexandria, Va., LaRouche
charged that a biased and govem-
mentally manipulated press has
caused him to be seen in a nega-
tive spotlight by the American
public. He added that due to this,
it was impossible for him to
receive a fair trial.

”There have been attacks
against me in the press, and with
that kind of situation, the jury
comes in prejudiced,” LaRouche
said. ’’It is impossible to have ,a
fair trial unless the jury is given
the opportunity to overcome any
prejudices.” ‘ «

LaRouche recently received" a

15-year prison sentence for con-

spiracy and mail fraud.

LaRouche is particulary upset
with the the phrase ”political ex-
tremist" used to describe him in
the press. LaRouche said he does
not understand what this phrase
is supposed to describe, but ad-
ded that he has an idea of where
it came from.

"The words ‘political extremist’
don't mean anything in the Eng-
lish language. What is a political
extremist? How can you be ex-
tremely political?" he said. ”|t's
a meaningless piece of gib-
berish.”

LaRouche feels that the feder-
al government directly ordered
the media to use this term to
describe him.

”The media has been directly
acting as a tool of the govern-
ment,” LaRouche said. ”The
major media, the top media, wit-
tingly so, with the lesser media
generally following the major
media." .

In response to this statement,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editor

‘John Craig 0 said, ”_That’s ri-

' diculous."

According to LaRouche, it is
the constant repetition of this
phrase by the press to the Ameri-
can people which has caused
him damage by creating a public
bias against him.

"The American people, partic-
ularly the yuppie, [have] no opin-
ions of their own. They borrow
other people's opinions,” he said.
”When you inundate this kind of
audience with ugly sounding
words, the reaction of the yuppie
is to say, ‘OK, I don't like that
person.’ ” A .

He explained that this is on
reason why he did not receive a
fair trial.

”The jury in Alexandria was
made up of government em-
ployee yuppies,” LaRouche said.

Does LaRouche feel he can
reverse what he calls media bias?

"I'd rather spend my time
working on things which offer a
better prospect of success,” he
said.

LaRouche has been designated
as anything from a National 50-
cialist to a communist. He said,

Retired Supreme Court justice falls ill in Florida

WASHINGTON (APJ — Re-
tired Supreme Court Justice Lewis
F. Powell was rushed to a Jack-
sonville, Fla., hospital Monday
with a respiratory infection, a
court spokeswoman said.

Kathy Arberg, the Supreme
Court's assistant public informa-
tion officer, said Powell, 81, was
admitted to-the Baptist Medical
Center in Jacksonville shortly af-

A ter noon EST suffering from what

was diagnosed as an ”acute up-
per respiratory infection.”

At the hospital, Powell was
reported in stable condition.
There was no immediate word as
to what medical treatment he was
receiving.

Powell is in Florida serving as
a visiting judge on a three—judge
panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.

Mrs. Arberg said Powell com-
plained of dizziness after the
panel's morning session.

Chief Judge Paul Roney of the
11th Circuit court said, ”Justice
Powell got a cold last weekend
before he came to Jacksonville.

’ He began feeling worse during

this morning's session,’and we in-
sisted that he see a physician this
afternoon.” He said he and
another judge would hear oral ar-
guments as a quorum of the court
and they would be taped so
Powell can listen to the argument
and participate in the decision of
the case.

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
Bush administration‘ Monday pro-
posed raising insurance fees on
both commercial banks and thrift

The plan, as outlined by Treas-
ury Secretary Nicholas A. Brady,
does not include a controversial
proposal to charge depositors a
direct tax. However, financial in-
stitutions would be expected to
pass on at least some of the costs
to consumers.

Frey death sentence
upheld unopposed

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —The
Pennsylvania Supreme Court
Monday upheld the death sen-
tence of convicted wife-killer
Roderick Frey, rejecting a
challenge to the state's electrocu-
tion law that jeopardized and
delayed executions.

Without dissent, the court re-
jected Frey’s claim that a 1913
law specifying a method of exe-
cution no longer was valid and
thus he could not be executed.

Either way, the court said, ”the
validity of the sentence of death
is rot tied to the method of im-
position.”

Frey’s attorney, Penn Glazier,
said Monday he would appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court if neces-
sary, and an American Civil
Liberties Union official said it still
could be years before anyone is
executed in Pennsylvania.

’’I am determined to keep fight-
ing to do everything I can to save
Roderick Frey’s life,”

Sen. Heinz promises

(AP) — U.S. Sen. John Heinz
said Monday he will introduce
legislation to extend for another
five years the voluntary steel re-
straint agreements, which steel-

_ makers claim have helped ,cut

imports and bolster their once ail-
ing industry."

Heinz, R-Pa., said he and Sen.

at least one—third of their col-
leagues to co—sponsor the bill and
President Bush to fulfill a last-
minute campaign promise to sign
it into law.

Classes for the physically motivated  

By Heidi White

For The Pitt News

Wouldn't an afternoon of sail-
ing or an evening of skiing be a
welcome change in the regular
class routine? If enrollment in
some unusual physical education
courses is any indication, then
the answer is a resounding ”yes.”

Several of these physical edu-
cation classes are offered at Pitt
as fun, one-credit options for stu-
dents interested in learning a new
sport or improving an old one.

Richard Bradshaw, the coordi-
nator of basic instruction, said
that physical activity enhances
the ability to study, and for that
reason, ”most of the good stu-
dents in the university get in-
volved in our programs.

”The department is always
looking into other alternatives be-

- sides the basketball-racquetball

kind of stuff,” said Bradshaw.
Even belly dancing was offered
during one semester, ”but it just
didn't go,” he said.

Now, classes like winter camp-
ing, ice climbing, wind surfing
and aerobics are packed and
difficult to enroll in after the first
week of registration.

Since four physical education
credits count toward graduation,
many students enroll in order to
-fill up a semester schedule--or take
-a -relaxing break from a really
rough one. According to Brad-
shaw, Pitt students are offered a
rare opportunity,‘ because letter
grades are available as compared
to the pass/fail entry offered by
most universities.

A variety of courses are offered,
including:

0 Sailing — ”Sai|ing offers a lot

.of appeal to a broad range of peo-

ple,” said instructor and 20-year
sailing veteran Barbara Elster. Fol-
lowing quizzes, classes and pool
sessions, the class travels 90
miles southeast of Pittsburgh to
Deep Creek, Md., where the
members test their skills in a man-
made lake overlooked by the
Wift ski area.

In her third year of teaching the
course, Elster claimed, ”l’ve
never had anyone leave without
[having experienced] a big sense
of excitement.

”One of the nicest things about
sailing is that you're using a
natural resource and you do not
destroy it. It's there for the next
person to use,” said Elster. This
also can be said about skiing.

0 Skiing'— No need to be a be-
ginner or an experienced skier to
sign up for this class; all ability
levels are accepted.

’’I took the class mainly be-
cause I wanted to ski, but it real-
ly helped me,” said sophomore
Jeff Romano. ’’I learned a lot.”

The class travels to Seven
Springs four evenings over a peri-
od of two weeks, depending on
conditions, for approximately
four hours of skiing and an hour-
long, small group lesson each
trip.

0 T’ai chil ch’aun Stan

Schwartz, instructor of the t’ai chi
ch’aun class, explained that ”T’ai

chi is a martial art based on lea'rn- .

ing to relax. The idea is to de-
velop a body that is flexible and
able to transmit force.

”Because the ancient Chinese
believed that as you age you get
stiff, it can essentially reverseithe
aging process by keeping mus-
cles soft and supple instead of

3 hard and stiff. :

”The key to t’ai chi is relaxing.

It is 90 percent a mental excercise

‘ comparable to physics or
philosophy,” Schwartz said.

Schwartz claimed that because
t’ai chi improves balance,
strength and timing, ”any sport
you do, you will [become] better
at.”

Students interested in obtaining
more information on these and
other physical education classes
can call the Physical Education
Basic lnstriction office.

Seminar
to aid
lottery
losers

By Eﬁk Krkﬂe
Staff Writer

It's that time of year again.

Once again students will be
placing their hands in the
housing lottery box in hopes
of picking a low enough num-
ber to avoid being shut out of
on-campus housing.

Anticipating that many stu-
dents will be unlucky and
draw a high number, the Stu-
dent Government Board is
sponsoring a workshop for all
those who must look for an
apartment in South Oakland
and elsewhere.

Attorney Shelia Ford, SGB
legal consultant, will be telling
students what to look for when
choosing an apartment, on
Feb. 16 at 6:30 p.m. in Dining
Room A, on the first floor of
the William Pitt Union. She
will emphasize to students the
importance of understanding
all the terms of the lease con-
tract before signing.

”Talk to the neighbors
around the apartment you are
interested in,” said Justin Law-

other institutions of Pitt's size.

The consultant determined that
Pitt's immediate needs include at
least 500 additional dorm spaces.

”Housing is the first priority.
We're sure we need at least 500
to 600 more beds, and maybe as
many as 4,500 more at some
point. The goal is to be able to
provide housing for all freshmen.
Any viable university has to have
that.  You're going to lose [stu-
dents] if you don’t,” Bugby said.

However, the report also stat-
ed 60 percent of Pitt's 4,370
dorm beds are now occupied by
upperclassmen.

Sasaki also listed several possi-
ble locations for a new dormito-
ry including South Oakland, the
hillside above Pitt Stadium an_d
the area on the hill adjacent to

- Schenley Farms.

Bugby said this last area is the

most likely location, despite the
disapproval of some residents of
the area.

He said the proposed dorm
complex will consist of several
low or midrise buildings no more
than three stories high. He noted
that enclosed staim/ays or esca-
lators would be needed to pro-
vide residents of these buildings
with protected access to the low-
er part of the campus.

The consultants found that
many university departments are
already cramped and have no
place to expand. These include
Pitt's libraries, several engineer-
ing departments, University Rela-
tions and departments in the
humanities and School of Health-
Related Professions.

Bugby said Pitt is considering
several possible means of ex-
panding Hillman Library.

’’It could expand vertically, or

there is also room for under-
ground expansion. It could also
possibly be hooked up with Car-
negie [Library] with a series of un-
derground malls,” Bugby
explained. _

Sasaki also evaluated which
areas of Oakland would be most
suitable for Pitt's long—range ex-
pansion.

’’In the long term, we see [the
shape of the campus as] an inner
circle of academic buildings with
a periphery of housing and an

outer periphery of parking,” Bug-‘

by said.

To accomplish this goal, ac-
cording to the report, the campus
will have to expand into South
Oakland, above Pitt Stadium, and
beyond South Craig Street. Pitt re-
cently purchased the former Con-
tinental Insurance Building near
South Craig Street.

head, SGB member and or-
ganizer of the workshop, ”and
don't forget to talk to other ‘
tenants of the building.” I

Lawhead said he is con-
cerned about student renters
because he, too, has rented in
the past and has had bad ex-
periences. ”I want students
who are looking for an apart-
ment to avoid the problems I
have had.” V

According to Lawhead,
most students are ”naive”
when looking for an apart-
ment, and some landlords,
know this and take advantage
of students.

If students understand leases
and security deposits and their
rights as tenants, they are more
likely to get a better deal, Law-
head said.

Placing the blame
on dorm residents

Dorm conditions have always been appalling.
When you put hundreds of 18-, 19- and 20—year—olds
in the same building, take away their parents and then
tell them to behave themselves, you're asking for trou-

. ble. Nothing new about that.

So what's all the fuss about? Are students living in
the residence halls complaining that they resemble
pig sties? Do students really think that the custodi-
ans aren’t doing their jobs? Well, wake up kids, it's
not their fault that you're careless enough to throw
the leftover ketchup and cheese from your "O" fries
on the walls, break the lights in the halls and vomit
in the stairwells. _

"-T'he‘problem-with themessy dorms isn't with the
people cleaning them up; rather, it's with the peo-
ple living in them.

Perhaps part of the reason for the mess is that the
residents don't realize it'll be coming back to haunt
them at the end of the year. Mom and Dad get you
right away by telling you to clean up your room; Pitt
gets you at the end of the year with a repair bill. And
guess what, kids, Pitt doesn't care whose fault it is
that the window on the fi re door to the stairwell got
broken, or all of the showercurtains ended up ripped,
or that the "exit" sign got stolen. It'll just charge the
entire floor. .

Dorm residents on particularly ill-treated floors
should consider their budgets the next time they want
to vent or overlook some healthy aggression enact-
ed against the university. Children are usually
punished when they misbehave, as are irresponsible

Those of you who have been

 _ wondering ifthe Bush administra-

tion has a sense of humor should
be delighted to find out that it
does. Recently, Secretary of the

“Treasury Nicholas Brady suggest-

ed that savings and loan deposi-
tors be taxed with a levy of 25 or
30 cents per hundred dollars.
When Brady sent up the trial bal-
loon, everyone in America

"laughed all the way to the bank.

How on earth did the S&Ls get

" 5 into such mess? Here is a typical
‘case of what happened:

Mom and Pop Parker ran a
delicatessen i_n Hillside Park.
When business got slow, the Par-

H “ kers decided to sell all of their

cold cuts and potato salad and
open an S&L instead. It was
Called The First Bonnie and Clyde

Pop Parker had no sooner

"Wait, Walter. I'm no longer in

"Why didn't you say so? I'll
have a $10,000 note, $100,000

"Walter, your credit stinks.
Why should I give you any
money?"

"Because you're married to my
sister, and when it comes to get-
ting loans from an S&L, your fa-
mily should come first.”

Pop Parker had no choice but

to extend all sorts of services to

Hitting Barbara below the belt?

CNN news anchor Bernard
Shaw, in his Inauguration Day tel-
evised interview with Barbara
Bush, leaned forward in his chair
and asked in his characteristical-
ly calm voice, "Barbara, it is
widely acknowledged that you
refuse to diet — tell us, why is
that?"

I had not been watching the 0

screen up to that point, but I ad-
mit that the question immediate-
ly captured my attention.

"Is this for real?" I thought.

I turned to witness the expres-
sion on Barbara Bush's face. She
did not appear to be disturbed by
the question, and her response
reflected the fact that she is sim-
ply comfortable with herself the
way she is. .

The questioning continued:
"And what about those fake
pearls," he asked. ‘ c

It couldn't be that she just likes
the way they look, I thought.

"Well," Barbara said, "I don't

_ know —— maybe I wear them to

in the S&L

$50,000 loan to redo her
bedroom. -

"What kind of collateral do
you have?" Mom wanted to
know. ' -

"Listen to Mrs. J.P. Morgan.
When people go into banking,
they immediately forget their
friends. You never asked me what
collateral I had when I was hold-
ing the ace, king, queen and jack
of hearts. If I had collateral, I
would have gone to the Chase
National, where at least the pens
don't smell of pickles." '

"I'm making an exception for
you," Mom said, "but don't go
blabbing all over the neighbor-
hood that The First Bonnie and

Clyde S&L is a patsy when it

comes to making loans."

I knew there had to be a good
reason for it. Perhaps now that
she's gotten that off her chest, she
won't have to wear them, espe-
cially since everyone now knows
the real reason behind them.
She-e—e-sh!

This highly respected news
journalist is asking the president's
_wife why she wears fake pearls
and doesn't diet. One would
think he were employed by the
National Enquirer.

What difference does it make
whether Barbara Bush diets or
not, or whether she wears fake
pearls or real ones — what value
could possibly be attached to this
type of questioning? ‘

But these questions are asked
nevertheless; as though they were
perfectly justified. ~

My aggravation was not direct-
ed at Bernard Shaw — after all,
his job is‘to ask questions which
he deems to be of‘interest to the
American public.

That's just the point. His ques-
tions reflect this society's obses-

P sion with appearance.

Barbara Bush is certainly not
beyond criticism, but attacking

"No, I haven't," Pop answered.
"When did you go into building
condos?" ‘

"I just decided to when I saw
who owned this S&L. I want to
call it ‘Parker Palace’ after you
and your lovely wife. I need $25
million in small bills."

"That's a lot."

"I'd rather owe it to you than
to strangers."

The upshot of this waslthat
Mom and Pop Parker had taken
care of their family, friends and
acquaintances and wound up in
the red to the tune of $40 million.

The Parkers weren't as dis-
turbed as one might think. As Pop
told the press when they were go-
ing under, "If we still had the
delicatessen business, nobody
would have‘ bailed us_out at all."

her appearance is without war-
rant. She is a handsome, no-
nonsense, down-to-earth woman.

50 why the focus on her ap-

. pearance? The answer is simple.

The Reagan era has made appear-
ances important. An image-
conscious president has departed
from Washington with his image
intact, but only after having
seduced" the public with his
celebrity gloss and showbiz-style
charm.

Nancy Reagan has made her .

mark primarily by virtue of her
discriminating taste in expensive
designer clothes.‘ It is no wonder
that the public has come to ex-
pect a show of wealth and style
_rather than substance.

Indeed, the White House has
acquired the characteristics of a
Beverly Hills’ mansion, and our
new first lady, Barbara Bush, just
doesn't fit that mold. '

But politics is not show busi-
ness, contrary to what the Reagan
era has led us to believe, and we
would be better advised to focus
our curiosity on Mr. Bush's poli-
cies rather than Mrs. Bush's ap-
pearance.

PERSPECTIVE

THE PITT NEWS

Explaining, not exploiting, AIDS

An Early Frost was the first truly
distinguished ”disease-of—the—
week” movie to deal with AIDS,
of course doing so informatively
and with sensitivity.

I watched the movie with a
couple of friends Saturday night,
as we were unfortunate enough
to be in the vicinity of a television
set at that time.

The made-for—TV movie was
somewhat informative, but as a
sensitive treatment of a serious
subject," it was somewhat disap-
pointing.

It was basically an exploitation
film. It played on the shock value

(of taking a successful, in-the-

closet gay man and turning him
into the equivalent of a leper.
While it was certainly packed
with little gems of medical
knowledge (As one of my fellow
viewers commented, ”This is the
pamphlet part of the film.”), there
was just such a plethora of un-
realistic characters and situations
that I found it difficult to wade
through them and discover any:

. a) useful information about
AIDS.

b) useful information about
people's reactions to AIDS
victims.

c) discernible point.

So, how about. some facts?‘

While wading through my
column may not seem, to some,
to be particularly preferable to
wading through An Early Frost, I
can at least claim to be more con-
cise than the producers of the

, ’’movie’’ (and I use the term

  

JON
BERGER

loosely).

0 As many as 1.4 million
Americans, one million
Brazilians, and up to five million
Africans are probably infected
with the HIV virus that can lead
to AIDS.

0 While the spread of the dis-

) ease among gay men has slowed

dramatically, the rate of transmis-
sion for intravenous drug users
has increased just as dramatical-
Iy. The number of drugyusers
newly diagnosed with AIDS last
year was greater than the number
of gay men newly diagnosed.
This is probably due to the new
emphasis on ”safe sex,” that is,
sex with the use of condoms, as
”safe” as you can get.

0 As far as heterosexual inter-
course goes, women are far more
at risk than men, with the current
figures showing that more than
three times as many'American
women seem to have contracted

the disease from men, as men
from women. However, of all the
new AIDS cases in the United
States last year, only 4.8 percent
were likely transmitted through
heterosexual intercourse.

. Looking at these figures makes
one wonder. The idea of making
a movie to inform people about
the disease is good. And there
was some information given in
An Early Frost. But that isn't my
point.

I actually made my major point
earlier. An Early Frost is an ex-
ploitation film.

And now I will expand on this
point: exploitation films are bad.

I'm not suggesting that the
makers of this movie sat down
and said, ”Now, how can we
make a killing by playing off the
panic and fear caused by the
AIDS epidemic?”.That kind of
mentality is what inspired the net-
work to buy the film, but that is
what we expect from the distribu-
tors of art, not the makers.

‘ They wanted to portray the pre-
judice and sheer panic that the
public is theoretically awash in.

' What they succeeded in doing

was creating an even more
panicky picture of people's reac-
tions to AIDS. This movie actual-
ly featured paramedics refusing to
take the protagonist to the hospi-
tal; in fact, they ran from the
house in fear and loathing.

Is the mindless fear of AIDS any
worse than the mindless fear of
peop|e’_s reactions to it?

Marching to the tune of swimsuits

VINC .
CAREY  

. The Sports Illustrated annual
swimsuit issue hit the newsstands
yesterday. This is the 25th an-
niversary edition of this American
standard. And it is about time that
people stopped complaining
about it. = ‘

Every year, the magazine is
sent a barrage of letters complain-
ing about the women who grace
the pages," modeling the latest in
bathing suits. _ '

, Some of these letters are sent
by ministers who don't think that
it is proper for a sports magazine
to show the latest in beach
fashion wear. Other letters are
sent by loving mothers who
wouldn't dare let their impres-
sionable children look at scanti-
Iy clad women (even though
most of those children have an
old copy of Playboy hidden un-
der their beds).

Finally, the best letters of all are
sent by women who don't usual-
ly read the magazine, but buy this
one issue and then say they

despise it because. it is sexist. , .

Well, Ithink therejasonsthat

 

  

these women sendhthe letters is ‘
because they look more like East
German Olympians than the
shapely models who appear in
the spread. I wonder if Sports ll-

_ lustrated ever gets any photos of

theselwomen? My guess is that
they don't.-

Maybe these feminists from
hell should stop buying the maga- -
zine, go the way of the ERA Am-
mendment and sit in the library
the rest of their lives.

There is nothing wrong with
the swimsuit issue. In fact, when

questioned about the magazine, -'

one woman said, ”More power
to them. If these women have the
bods and are willing to show

"them off, then why not? I know

I'd like to pose for [the
magazine].”

This is the attitude that more
women should have. Instead of
complaining about it, they should

just go with the flow. Don't pick

up the issue if you don't like it.

I'm sure Sports Illustrated won't“
be hurt by—the lack of your
purchase.

Now men, on the other hand,
— or at least normal men — love
the magazine year-round and’
hold a special place in their
hearts for the swimsuit issue.

In it, you can price a birthday
present for the little woman (if
you are lucky enough to have a
little woman who can wear one

.of the suits pictured without look-

ing absolutely hideous). If not,
you can dream about some day
having a little woman who would
look good in such a suit.

This year's, cover features a

' seductive photo of Kathy Ireland
. (of course, she would look seduc-

 

tive wearing’ a burlap bag, but
that's another subject). Inside the
magazine, red-blooded American
men can see the best that the
world of fashion has to offer, as
well as the best the modeling
world can give us at this time.
There are also those prudes
who say that there is no place for
swimsuits in a sports magazine.
Well, I say they are dead wrong.

Is swimming not a sport? Un-

less you live in certain places in
Europe, swimming nudeis
frownedupon, if not illegal. So,
in a way, ‘Sports Illustrated is
providing a public _service for the
reader as well as for the police in
beach cities by showing them the
latest swimsuits to wear. I

Also, what is more of a sport
than girl-watching? I don't think
anyone out there can say with a
straight face that he doesn't watch
a good—looking girl walking
across the beach. Men look at
them for obvious reasons, and
women look at them because
they wish they could be like
them.

That's what it all boils down to,
isn't it? All women wish they
could be as voluptuous as those
who appear in the magazine.
Maybe if they tried, they could.
The world would be a much bet-
ter place. '

All those who are going to
complain about this line of think-
ing can just sit in their own
jealousy, because they know that
the opinion is right. ' '

Good night, PB, wherever you

' are.

Why rock bands don’ t
sing about the Contras  

Ever since the late '60s, a
certain trend has taken hold of
the music industry —- it has be-
come the sixth estate for the
liberal doctrine.

Rare are the times nowadays

. when you can turn on the ra-
dio without hearing some
leftist minstrel declaring his
hatred for nuclear war, as if
anyone actually loved the
idea. Yes, America has turned
into ”Radio-Left” or ”WLFT,"
for short. Ah, but it wasn't al-
ways thus.

MARIO
There once was a time in the 
'40s when Frank Sinatra

would croon about ’’Polka Dots and Moonbeams" and Bing ‘
Crosby sang about his ”PistoI Packin’ Mama” (no, this was not
for the gun lobby). ' ' ' .

These days,‘we have Peter Gabriel balladeering about ”Biko,”
Bob Dylan complaining about nuclear holocaust in ”A Hard
Rain’s Gonna Fall" and U2 singing about everything that's left
(no pun intended). '

My question is why hasn't a conservative band ever emerged -
to write songs in praise of, say, Ronald Reagan or the police
force instead of the constant bashing that they get? Or how about
a song about how the Soviet Union abuses human rights and
invades countries like Afghanistan? 

The hypocrisy of the leftist rock artist grotesquely surfaced
on the televised 1986 Amnesty International concert. Although
Amnesty International is completely impartial when it comes
to human-rights vio|ations,—the singers performing sure as hell _
weren't. Groups like the Hooters and folk-dinosaurs such as
Peter, Paul and Mary loved to point out abuses in South Africa,‘
El Salvador and Chile but neglected to mention the same viola-
tions occurring in communist nations like Cuba, Nicaragua and"
the Soviet Union. ___ .  . .., 3;; s 

From John Lennon to Paul Simon to Sting, the; Ii.b_eraI«to,r,ch 
has been fumbled from onegeneration of singers toanother. ‘:5
During this time no conservative singer has ever achieved
succes fou, that extraordinary success. Oh sure, Elvis Presley
had his picture taken with then—President Nixon and even tried ,
to convince ”Tricky Dicky” that The Beatles were subversive, 
but that was probably because the Fab Four were knifing into
his record sales.

Frank Sinatra is a big—wig Republican singer and has been the _, 
star entertainer at the last three inaugural galas, twice for Rea- . _. . ,;j.-I‘;
gan and once for Bush. But OI’ Blue Eyes used to be a New I '
Deal-liberal and was a big supporter of FDR and JFK. Sinatra
switched parties back in the early '60s when JFK’s brother Bob-
by, the attorney-general, refused to leave Sinatra's Mafia bud-' - '
dies alone — or so the story goes. Regardless, Frank is too busy »
singing about ’’New York, New York” to care about the Stra— ’ ‘
tegic Defense Initiative. a,  

So why aren't there other right-wing rock groups? A friend ” I  
of mine, Tim Frank, offered the suggestion that ”rock music is '
by nature rebellious, and the character of a right-wing rock
group would probably be of a law-and-order variety, thus con-

. flicting with the anti-establishment nature of rock music.’.’  -‘
Though I disagree with the premise that all or most rock music —
is anti-establishment, this is the best theory I've heard so f_ar-.'.__f;r*
' So where does this ‘dilemma leave the conservativesl-who  -
aren't so stuffy that they‘ still enjoy listening to rock music be-_  
tween economics classes? Must we be forced to listen to Sting  L ,
berating Chilean President.'Pinochet in ”They Dance AIone?”7  
Probably. ; ‘

I guess the only thing to do is to sit patiently and wait for I
some record company to finally sign a group which does not '
sympathize with the liberal special interest groups. In the mean- I
time, there's only one thing to do any time Neil Young, Dire. 
Straits or. The Guess Who pop on the radio —- listen to them;r' ._
you don't have to agree with their views to enjoy the music. I ‘

such as teenage drug abuse.

Second, the programmers are
working on placing long—term
volunteer task forces, alliances
and/or coalitions which will con-
tinue to deal with social problems
after a particular campaign has
come to an end.

Also,‘ they will televise and
offer resources as well as a plan
of action to the task forces.

”We hope that we can expand
what we can do. ‘Our goal is to
get good, solid information to
raise issues and to inform the
people about motivational tools,”
said Woodwell.

The idea for this expansion sur-
faced as a result of many years of
successful WQED outreach pro-
gramming with good results.

Many citizen task forces have
already been established which
have addressed such issues as
drug and alcohol abuse among
teenagers. After a number of
years, these task forces are still

active.
Presently, the center is working

on the next Project Literacy Unit-

QSwimmers notch come-from-behind win at OSU

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim team
had to overcome many difficul-
ties in order to defeat a deter-
mined Ohio State team Friday,
1J3‘147, to end their dual meet
season with an impressive 9-1

» cord.

The trouble started even before
the meet began. Ohio weather
didn't cooperate as snow, rain

and hail forced Pitt to show up .

behind schedule, leaving little
time for physical and mental
preparation. ‘

Two of Pitt's top swimmers, Ka-
rin Masal and Liz Sari, were un-
der the weather with the flu and
couldn't participate, which added
to Pitt's troubles.

D As a result, Pitt found itself in

a close meet and had to come
from behind._

’’It was a great meet,” said Pitt
Coach David Belowich. ’’It came
down to the fact that we needed
to take second and third place in
the last relay in order to win.”

. Pitt's ‘Laurel Walczak, Noelle
"iﬁrry, Celeste Makiel and
Christine Gallagher .came
through with the second—place
finish. Kara Moxie, Tricia Rickert,
Anne Komer and Maureen Cleary
clinched the Pitt victory with a
third-place finish.

The meet started "out a little
roughly for Pitt, though. The team
uncharacteristically lost the
200-meter medley relay race, and
tak second by .02 seconds. San-
dy Albright, Laura Lee Sullivan,
Barry and Gallagher made up the
relay team. J
' Ohio State then won the 1,000
freestyle event as Pitt's Theresa

Dr. D's

.;aSay the NFL is going to expand
its membership this off-season,

and we are placed in charge of

. team personnel for the new fran-
chise. Being that this is the first
year of the National Football
League's new free-agency plan,
in which each franchise is al-
lowed to protect only 37 mem-
bers of its roster, we'll-try to fill

our expansion roster with the best -

of the unprotected huddled mass-
es of injured, aging, or unwant-
ed players. ‘ -

First, we've got to find a place
 these. guys to play. Let's see,
‘ cksonville could use a fran-
chise, where our home field
_would be the 73,000-seat Gator
Bowl. So could Oakland and'Bal-
timore, the old NFL mainstays of
the '70s, which deserve better

g than what the respective turncoat
owners Robert Irsay and Al Da-
vis gave them.. _ -

Well, Irsay promised that he

would give the nickname Colts
back to the city of Baltimore if the
‘lﬁigue would provide it with an
expansion franchise. So, in the
sense of tradition, pretend Com-
missioner Pete Rozelle awards an
expansion club to’ the Maryland
city, and now, playing in
Memorial Stadium, the Baltimore
Colts are reborn.

Indianapolis will now call its

I-NFL expansion

Most important position on a
football team? Quarterback. Sec-
ond most? Backup quarterback.
This, sadly, is the leanest lot of
offensive players from which to
chose. The best QBs available are
Danny White of Dallas, Gary
Hogeboom, of Indianapolis, Jeff
Rutledge of the Giants, Steve
Grogan of the Pats and Don
Strock of the Browns. The most

1 effective starter here would be‘

Danny.White, whose play has
suffered over the last few seasons

- in Dallas due to a horrendous

offensive line. With any pass pro-
tection at all, he could lead the
Colts to at least seven wins. Don
Strock has been the game's best
relief pitcher since 1977, and this
past season, he showed he still
has some ammunition left in his
right -arm by leading injury-
riddled Cleveland into the
playoffs. White and Strock,
maybe Rutledge as the third-
stringer.

At running back, the top can-
didates are Matt Suhey of Chica-
go, Timmy Smith of Washington,
Steve Strachan of the Raiders,
Robb Riddick of Buffalo, Earnest
Jackson of the Steelers and Craig

James of'New England. Riddick’s

poor attitude and past drug his-
tory scratch him immediately.
James’ knee is quite suspect.
We'll take the young Timmy

‘ an off-year in 1988, and the jour-

Sandy Albright got Pitt on the
winning track‘ with a victory in
the 100 backstroke. Janine Atiyeh
took third in the event.
Sullivan kept things going for
Pitt with a -first place in the 100
breaststroke. Cleary, a senior,

attitude problem or not, always
has a quality first season with a
team before tailing off.
The wide receiver position
needs a possession type and a
J speed burner. Cris Collinsworth

was virtually ignored by the Cin-_

cinnati offense this year, but he
still has agfew catches left in him.

Despite bouts with illness and
injury, the women's gymnastics
team managed to defeat Ball State
University last weekend, 180.2 to
176.2.

”|t’s about time,” said head
coach Debbie Yohman. ”That’s

~where we should be.”

With top juniors Shelly Sleith
and Hope Celani injured, and top
sophomore Carrie Carnesale sick,
the team had a good meet despite
the abnence of their three
teammates.

’’It was exciting to see the team

2 spirit so alive,” said Celani, who

expects to be back at the end of
the season after hyperextending
her knee two weeks ago. ”Every-
body was really down last
week.”

The Lady Panthers started out

strong on vaulting. Senior Trish
Aser led off with a 9.25 for a solid
front handspring with a full twist,
placing second on the event.

Senior Stephanie Megill per-
formed a piked tsukahara and
landed a little low, but still scored
well with a 9.0.

Sophomore Kathy Wallish ran
into some trouble on vaulting
when she nearly missed her
hands on a full twist on/hand-
spring off. She performed a bet-
ter second vault, but had a shaky

V landing and put her hand down.

’’I think Kathy was the only dis-
appointed vaulter,” Yohman
said.

Wallish still managed an 8.9 on

vault. Sophomore Tina Taylor’

and freshman Jen Butkovich each
scored 9.05 for their vaults, while
another freshman, Gina Venezia,
turned in the second-highest vault
score for Pitt with a 9.1.

The uneven parallel bars seem
to be the event the Lady Panthers
are having the most trouble with.

”Bars is still the event we've
got to work on,” Yohman said.

Sophomore Robyn Borchers
had a good routine up until a fall
on her dismount, scoring 8.3
points. Venezia also had one fall
when she failed to catch a release
move in her routine, scoring 8.2.

Taylor, competing on the bars
for the first time this season,
turned in one of the better rou-
tines for an 8.55. Wallish came
back after a difficult first event
(vaulting) and hit her best routine
of the season, scoring 8.75.

Butkovich hit a nice set for a
9.25 and a tie for second place,
while sophomore Jeannie Vec-
chio continued her winning bar
streak, with a 9.45 for first place
on the event.

Senior defensive end Burt
Grossman, expected to be a
high-round draft pick in the
NFL draft later this year, has
‘announced that he is donating
$100,000 to the University of
Pittsburgh and $5,000 to his
alma mater, Archbishop Car-
roll High School in Bala Cyn-
wyd, Pa. -

”| just wanted to show m
appreciation for the many
great opportunities that have
been afforded me,” the

Grossman to donate $100,000  

6-foot—6, 270-pound Gross-
man said.

”This is a terrific "display of
generosity on Burt's part,” said
Pitt football coach Mike Gott-
fried, ”and a great example for
athletes everywhere who may .
have the opportunity to give

.something back to their

schools. .
”What makes this even a lit-
tle more meaningful and spe-
cial is that Burt has made this
commitment without knowing
what's going to happen in the

draft,” Gottfried said.

Grossman, a three-year start-
er for the Panthers, is largely
considered a first—round draft
pick. The NFL Scouting Report
listed Grossman as the No. 1
defensive end in the nation
prior to the 1988 season.

Grossman was hindered by
a sprained ankle for a portion
of the season, however.

The team, for the most part,
dominated the balance beam,
Wallish leading off with a colle-
giate high of 9.0 and Butkovich
hitting a career high of 9.0. Vene-
zia followed with a good routine,
scoring 9.1.

Taylor had one fall, but still
pulled off a good score of 8.9,
while Aser couldn't quite stay on,
falling twice for a 8.25.

Borchers, who had some trou-
ble during beam warm-ups, hit a
great set and won the event with
a 9.2. - ‘

”She did the best routine I've
ever seen her do on’ beam,” said
Yohman. ’’I can't remember a
break in her routine.”

‘Venezia took second on the

event, while Wallish and But— ‘

kovich tied for third.

”We swept balance beam,
which is kind of nice for a
change,” said Yohman.

On floor exercise, Butkovich
started off with an 8.7. Aser hit a
high score for the season with a
9.1. Freshman Tracy Jung had a
good routine, scoring 8.6. Vene-
zia over-rotated her double-back
in her first tumbling pass, scoring
8.9.

Wallish placed second on the
event with a 9.2, and Taylor won
the event with a 9.35.

lineup everv meet.

freshmen runners coming alive at right time

By Steve Gaydos
Staff Writer

Throughout the season, the Pitt
men's track team has been rely-
ing primarily on the perfor-
mances of proven stars such as
Eric Canon, Dave Moore and El-
bert Ellis. With the Big East tour-
nament just two weeks away,
Coach John Vasvary continued to

,wait patiently for some of his
oung runners to rise up and
make themselves noticed. ‘

The wait ended this weekend
at Notre Dame at an invitational
meet. Freshmen Todd Walthall
and Brett Shields showed signs

that they will be important factors
in the hurdling events when the
tournament rolls around. Both
Shields and Walthall posted their
best times of the season over the
weekend.

Vasvary stressed the impor-
tance of those performances. ”l’ll
be counting on them to score for
us in the hurdles along with Eric
Canon and Elbert Ellis,” Vasvary
said.

Those are high expectations
from a coach who understands
how unpredictable freshmen ath-
letes can be. ”Freshmen have to
make that big adjustment — new
coaches, new surroundings,”

Vasvary said. ”When they come
here, you don't know if they'll be
able todo it or not.”

‘Now, at the end of the season
when they are needed the most,
the young runners are coming
through. Freshman Franz Jobson
played a significant role in the Pitt
mile relay team, finishing third
overall. ”Jobson ran a nice lead-
off leg for us,” Vasvary said, ”and
that's a big plus for us. He's
another freshman thatis rising up
and showing us something.”

Quarter-miler Chop Burton has
had his effectiveness this season
limited by injuries. Now the in-

juries appear to have healed, and
Burton appears ready to make an
impact. ”Chop is really going to
help us depthwise,” Vasvary said.
”He’s a guy we can go to at the
end of a meet because he still has
fresh legs. We can depend on
him because he's done it for us
in the past.”

Distance runner Paul Friedrich
and half-miler Mike Thomas were
also among those who opened
eyes at Notre Dame. Dave Price,
a-consistent runner on whom the
Panthers have depended all year,
won the 400-meter with a time of
47.68, breaking the school

record.

In Washington, D.C., Canon
and Ellis were going up against
some of the best athletes in the
world, including several Olympi-
ans. Both Ellis and Canon ran in
the 60 hurdles. Canon finished
fifth with a time of 7.77, narrow-

‘ ly missing Roger Kingdom's

school record. Ellis finished right
behind in sixth place with a time
of 7.90. _

Vasvary knows that for Pitt to
have a shot at the Big East cham-
pionship, it will take a combina-
tion of great efforts by the-old

Hockey club pummels Slippery Rock, 25-2.

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

Golden Mile Ice Center is quiet
now, but it was anything but
quiet at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday
when the Panther Hockey Club
hosted the Slippery Rock Univer-
sity Rockets.

The Panthers crunched the
Rockets 25-2 to bring their record
to 10-0 in the West Penn College
Hockey Association, and 10-4
overall.

During the tvvo-hour contest,
there were 27 goals scored, 33
assists earned, 28 penalties (for a

| SEMESTER AT

total of 74 penalty minutes) and
six hat—tricks.

The first period opened with
the Panthers netting eight goals,
scored by Brian Woyt, Verne
Shaver, Dave Koval, Mike
Cuchran, Tony Travato and Bri-
an Owens.

Also during the first period, the
Panthers received one penalty
while the Rockets received four.

Four of the Panthers players,
who scored in the first period,
would go on to net the Panthers’
six hat—tricks. .

of the hat—tricks were scored by
Koval. Koval has averaged three
goals per contest over the past
seven games. The remaining
three hat—tricks were scored by
Travato, Owens and Woyt,

The second period opened
with the Panthers scoring three
consecutive goals, by Travato,
Koval and Greg Schmittetter.

the Rockets scored their first goal

five penalties, while the Rockets
received six.

The third period opened with
another goal scored by Koval to
bring the score to 13-1. Follow-
ing Koval’s goal, a fight broke out
in the Rockets’ zone. As a result
of the fight, Panther right wing-
men Schmittetter and Mike

the game, and one of the Rock-
ets was also dismissed.

The Panthers then went on to

standbys like Canon and Ellis, as
well as by youngsters like
Walthall, Shields and Jobson.

”For us to have a shot, we have
to be hitting on all cylinders, with
everybody we have contribut-
ing,” Vasvary said.

The strength of teams like
Georgetown make this point very
clear.

’’Almost everyone on the
Georgetown roster was a high
school All-American. On paper,
we're not supposed to beat
them,” Vasvary said, ”but our

guys have great toughness. They
have reputations-as great com-
petitors.”

Next weekend some of the Pitt
squad will be traveling to the
Meadowlands in East Rutherford,
N.J,., for an invitational meet,

I while the rest of the team goes to

West Virginia for the Hardees in-
vitational. These meets will ‘be

cuse the weekend of Feb. 18.

Koval’s goal, the Rockets
replaced goaltender Rich Skalko
with freshman goaltenderjennifer
Lewis. This was Lewis’ second
game of the season, and at least
the first time that some SRU
members voiced their displeasure
concerning her presence.

”We only had three goal-
tenders come out this season, and
the league requires that we have
three goaItenders,” said Pat Car-
roll, the Rockets coach. _

’’I put Jennifer in because she
couldn't hurt us. Besides, the
game was a farce. The officiating
was terrible, and Pitt is a power-
house,” added Carroll.

’’I don't even know how she
got in the game,” said Mike

Hotrom, one of the Rockets team '

members who is out nursing a
shoulder injury. ”She gave up
nine goals, and she wasn't even
in for a whole period.

’’I don't believe that girlsﬂe

should be playing ice hockey, un-

less it were at the intramural lev-

el. After all, this is men's ice
1 hockey. I "

”What can you do? You're
damned ‘if you do and you're
damned if you don't. I still don't
feel that she should play,’’
Hotrom said emphatically.

The Panthers netted three con-
secutive goals, scored by Woyt,
Koval and Shaver. Following
Shaver’s goal, the Rockets scored
their final goal‘ at 11:14.
