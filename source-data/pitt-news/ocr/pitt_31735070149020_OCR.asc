Board of

Trustees to
set tuition

this Friday

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor , 

The state’s contribution to Pitt’s
coffers is set for the upcoming
year, but how much the Univer-
sity’s students will pay in tuition
is still undecided. '

On Friday, July 13, at 8:15 a.m.
in 2700 Posvar Hall, the Board of
Trustees will meet to set Pitt’s tu-
ition and budget for the upcoming
school year.

The announcement of a-new
tuition rate comes after Gov. Tom
Corbett passed a $27.66 billion
state budget for the 2012-2013
ﬁscal year on June 30 that keeps
the level of appropriation for the
State System of Higher Education
consistent with the year prior. The
appropriationwas not adjusted for
the rate of inﬂation. ‘

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported on June 29 that Chan—_
cellor Mark Nordenberg said any
increase to tuition would remain
beneath the consumer price index.
But Pitt spokesman John Fedele
clariﬁed that statement on July
10, stating that the “blended rate”
would be below the CPI.

The blended rate is an aggre-
gation of the tuition across Pitt’s
main and satellite campuses,
meaning that some campuses
could have different increases.

This differentiated rate of
tuition based on the campus is
something also familiar to another
state—re1ated institution — Penn-
sylvania State University.

Obama speech focuses on middle-class struggles

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

President Barack Obama said he
wakes up every morning to go to
work for millions of Americans.

And he wants four more years to
continue that. ‘

Over the course of his 30-min-
ute speech, Obama addressed a
smorgasbord of major election is-
sues including education, energy
and the war in Afghanistan. But the
thrust of his speech centered on the
economy and the importance of the
middle class.

“That dream of a strong middle
class —— that’s what America’s always
been about,” Obama said. “That’s
what led me to get into public ser-
vice. That’s what led me to ask for
re—election.”

About 6,500 people braved tem-

_ peratures in the high 90s to hear the

president speak on the College of
Fine Arts Lawn at Carnegie Mellon
University Friday. The speech was
part of Obama’s two—day “Betting
on America” bus tour that started in
Ohio Thursday and ended with his
appearance in Pittsburgh.

“VVe’re doing everything we can
for the campaign, and if that means
standing in the heat, then that’s what
we’ll do,” said Alexandra Brosovich,
a Pitt junior and a fellow for Orga-
nizing for America, a community
organizingproject of the Democratic
National Convention.

But despite campaign volunteers’

efforts to cool down the crowd by V

passing out water bottles and spritz-
ing attendees with water, 13 people
were transported from the venue to
hospitals by ambulances according
to Pittsburgh Emergency Medical
Services.

Paramedics treated many others

at the event for heat-related issues.

Yet the heat didn’t deter the
president from delivering his mes-
sage. Beginningwith a greeting from
his family members back home, he
progressed into his speech with a
discussionvof his original motiva-
tions for seeking the presidency.

Obama said that part of his rea-
son for runningin2008 was that he
sawa strong middle class “battered”
during the Bush administration.

“We had seen a decade when the
middle class dreams were under as-
sault,” he said.

He described how during that
era, gas and grocery prices increased
while Americans’ salaries declined.

“All of it culminated in the worst
ﬁnancial crisis seen in our lifetime,”
he said.

Obama described the process
he and his administration imple-
mented to strengthen the economy

as “painstaking” and “laborious.”

“We knew we wouldn’tbe able to
do it overnight because these prob-
lems weren’t created overnight,” he
said.

Despite ajune job report released
this morning that showed no change
in the 8.2 percent unemployment
rate and the creation of only 80,000
more jobs, Obama remained upbeat
when addressing the current eco-
nomic situation in his speech.

He noted the creation of 4.8 mil-
lion jobs in the past 28 months and
that America has more manufactur-
ing jobs today than in the 1990s.

But he admitted that more work
needed to be done for the economy.

“What we all understand is we’ve
got so much more today to do,” he
said. “Too many of our friends, fam-
ily members and neighbors are still

Former star Pitt running back, Dion Lewis,
21, was arrested early Sunday morning
after allegedly breaking glass doors off
their hinges at a downtown Albany, N.Y.,
hotel, according to Albany police.

Albany Police Public Information Of-
ﬁcer Steve Smith said police received a
call at 4:40 a.m. on Sunday, July 8, of two
men pounding on the doors of a Hampton
Inn 8: Suites. When officers arrived, one
of the men had already pulled a ﬁre alarm
at the building.

Smith said Lewis and his brother La-
mar Lewis, 35, were arrested on a misde-
meanor charge of reckless endangerment
of property and a felony charge of falsely
reporting an incident in the second degree.

Both men were arraigned later that day
in the Albany City Criminal Court. Lewis

was released on his own reconnaissance,

having no prior arrests in the state of New
York. His brother was sent to the Albany
County Jail without bail, having a record
of several past arrests and having served
jail time in the state, Smith said.

Lewis was drafted in the ﬁfth round
of the NFL draft in 2011 by the Philadel-
phia Eagles after breaking a number of
freshman rushing records at Pitt. This
past season, he served as the Eagles.’ pri-
mary backup running back’ for fellow Pitt
alumnus LeSean McCoy..

Lewis issued a statement on his current
team’s website on Tuesday.

“I want to apologize to my family, the
Albany community, the Eagles organiza-
tion and fans, and to the NFL for my in-
volvement in an incident this past week-
end,” he said in the statement. “It was
never my intention to cause any public
alarm or damage any property. I am sorry
for any embarrassment and inconvenience
that my actions have caused.” g

Annemarie Mountz said that the university’s
President, Rodney Erickson, will propose to
the Board of Trustees a 2.9 percent increase
for Pennsylvania residents at the main cam-
pus and a 1.9 percent increase for those at the
satellite campuses. The Board is set to vote
on the university’s tuition on Friday, July 13.
For the past two years, Penn State and
Pitt have taken the No. 1 and No. 2 positions,
respectively, for the highest tuition for in-
state students at a public, four year school.
Temple University, another state-related
institution receiving the same amount of
funding from the state, announced onjune

28 that its base tuition for undergraduate
in—state students will remain at $13,006 — a

number consistent with last year’s tuition.

Robert Beecher, chairman for Pitt’s Stu-
dent Government Board’s Governmental
Relations Committee, said the University
and the state government have a relation-
ship that requires each to work together to
ﬁnd a balance. .

“Part of the reason Pitt got its [state]
funding is because it promised to keep tu-
ition steady [with the rate of inﬂation],”
Beecher said. “I hope Pitt maintains its
pledge and doesn’t go above [the rate of]
inﬂation.”

Beecher added that because Pitt’s funding
derives from two primary places —— the state
government and tuition — he doesn’t expect
the tuition to remain at last year’s levels.

“If you’re provided ﬂat funding every
year, you can’t expect ﬂat tuition,” he said.

out of wor .”

Obama told his listeners that the way to
ensure this work continues is to re-elect him
in the November election.

“This election is not just about two can-
didates or two parties. It’s about two funda-
mentally different visions of where we take
America.” .

Obama characterized hisopponent’s vision
as one based on tax cuts for the wealthy that
are ﬁmded by cuts to funding for education
and decreasing regulations on companies.

The president deﬁned his own vision as
“building not from the top down, but from
the middle class outward.”

He launched into an explanation of the
ways in which he would go about building out
from the middle class. One of his key focuses
in this regard was higher education.

“Let’s invest in our young people,” he said.
“We need to do more to bring tuition down.
Higher education is not an economic luxury.
It’s an economic necessity.”

Obama suggested taking the funds previ-
ously used for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
and putting those toward lowering the national
deﬁcit and investing in American jobs.

“Let’s put Americans back to work,” he said.

Obama also addressed the Supreme Court’s
recent decision to uphold the constitutionality
of the Affordable Care Act.

“The Supreme Court has spoken —— the law
we passed is here to stay,” he said to thunder—
ous applause from the audience. “We have
millions of young people able to stay on their
parents’ health plan because of that health
care law. I make no apologies for it. I believe
it was the right thing to do.”

The president ﬁnally summed up his speech '

with an appeal to the crowd.
_“If you still believe in me, like I believe in
you, I hope you’ll stand by me in 2012,” he said.
Other politicians from the area attended
the speech, including Mayor Luke Ravenstahl,

Rep. Dan Frankel, D‘-Pittsburgh, and Allegheny V

‘County Executive Rich Fitzgerald.

“It was great,” Fitzgerald said of the presi-
dent’s appearance. “He really connects with
people here in Western Pennsylvania. It’s a
class of people who are hard workers.”

Fitzgerald called the scene of many Western
Pennsylvanians standing out in the sweltering
heat for hours a “real testimony to the support
he has here.”

Mohammed Bumy, "a Pitt junior and vol-
unteer for Obama’s re-election campaign,
supported the president’s message, saying,
“This president’s done a lot to make college
affordable.” ‘

Pitt alumnus Darrin Dixon agreed, citing a
bill that Obama signed after he left Pittsburgh
for Washington, D.C., to keep student loan
interest rates from doubling.

“There’s no doubt that out of the two can-
didates, he’s the most pro-student,” Dixon
said. -

Operation Grab SCOTUS Wild success,
country still duped about health care

Hardest aspect of Justice John Roberts’ face to impersonate? You guessed it —— the ears. MCT Campus

Matt Schaff
0pz'm'07zs Editor

This letter was retrieved ﬁ'om the
dumpster outside the lavish oﬁice
of Behemoth Health, a K Street
lobbying ﬁrm that brings the in-

terests ofvariousfor-proﬁt health '

insurance companies to the U.S.
Congress.

Dearest Mother and Father,

Just checking: Do you have any
experience keeping a chief justice
in your basement?

I’m itching for advice, not only
becausejohn Roberts is becoming
a handful — instead of eating, he’s
built a macaroni representation
of the Commerce Clause — but
also because people are starting
to ask questions. For some reason
they can’t sit comfortably with
the notion that the same guy who
George Bush appointed and who
ruled in favor of corporations be-
ing people suddenly became the

guy who made possible the greatest
liberal achievement since 1965. A
right—wing loyalist on the supreme
bench couldn’t just out—of-the-
blue change his mind to support a
Democratic president’s signature
achievement, unless his decision
involved some funny business
(they’re not just crying conspiracy;
one commenter even blamed Rob-
erts’ epilepsy meds for altering his
cognition).

Well I’m afraid it’s only a mat-
ter of time before the curious cats
in the media latch on to the real
explanation: That we, the health
insurance companies, kidnapped
Supreme Court Chief justice John
Roberts and impersonated him
in late deliberations to ensure a
positive ruling on the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act.
And now that we’ve got our ruling,
our impersonator’s off the Italian
coast and Roberts is going on pasta
strikes, we need to ﬁgure out what’s

next.

And when I say “what’s next,”
I’m speaking intermsof managing
the kidnap situation, not regarding
the trillions of dollars that, thanks
to SCOTUS, are now barreling to-
ward our industry. Oh yeah, you’ve
realized that, right? Whatever
you’ve heard on network TV about
who wins or loses from Obamacare
is probably wrong. Americans have
been told that the law would ei-
ther mean socialist takeover of
the health care system (the liber-
als win, the Constitution loses) or
deliver a progressive panacea to
our unsustainable health-related
spending (the people win, the
price-gouging insurance executives
lose). Alas, the public’s ignorance
is our bliss.

Instead of doing Stalin’s bid-
ding or actually ﬁxing the problem,
Obamacare represents not only a

continuation of ﬂawed status quo (us) — it’s
in fact a brilliant ploy to make the status quo
rich. What else would you expect of a law that
was primarily written by a former insurance
company vice president? Now that the big-
gest parts of the law were declared consti-
tutional (we pay our judicial impersonators
well), our sponsoring health insurance ﬁrms
are busy sewing stretchier pockets into their
pants and designing custom mansions for
their cleaning crews.

It’s all about proﬁt. Think about it.
The individual mandate plus huge subsi-
dies will bring millions of new customers

(many ﬁnanced by public money) into in-
surance pools, which will balloon revenue
from premiums relative to structural costs.
More people might be insured, sure, but the
underlying health insurance system, with
all of its ﬂaws, will just simply increase in
size. Thankﬁilly, Obamacare doesn’t radi-
cally change our business models; it forces
citizens’ dollars into our salivating mouths.

But wait —— we insurance companies can
no longer raise premiums based on pre-ex-
isting conditions, you say? And wouldn’t this
make health care more affordable for individ-
uals? Psha — we can still price-discriminate
based on geography (high-cost areas won’t
be bailed out by low-cost areas), we’ll still
employ armies of staff to ﬁght with doctors

and drive up their fees and, given the extra
bureaucracy layers needed to manage the in-
coming state—by—state insurance exchanges,
there’s every indication that average premi-
ums would rise, not fall, with Obamacare
(maniacal laugh  maniacal laugh ...).

If the day ever comes when the public
ﬁnds out about our masterful ruse on the high
court, that’s hopefully the day after I take my
bonus and ﬂy to a new, U.S. taxpayer-funded
Mexican villa. But to be honest, it would be
even worse if they learned the true failings
of their free-market health insurance sys-

tem and then did something crazy — like V

extending the lower—cost Medicare program
to everyone.
In the meantime, perhaps you could help

usout: How many times should you replay
Disney’s CGI-stravaganza “John Carter” be-
fore a chief justice forgets who he is and can
ﬁnally be reintroduced into the wild?

Sincerely,

Cornelius Schaff
Vice President of Covert Operations

Have even clevererideas than Obamacare
to protect the vested interests of private
health insurance companies? You, too, could

FILM REVIEW

Spider-Man spreads his ‘amazing’ Web

Anna Weldon
A€9°E Editor

“The Amazing Spider-Man"
Directed by: Marc Webb
Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma
Stone, Rhys lfans

Grade: A

It’s not easy for every outcast to look
good in a skin-tight unitard, but in
“The Amazing Spider-Man,” the most
recent Marvel Comics movie, Peter
Parker makes it work.

One of Marvel’s most popular
characters lights up the screen in his

red and blue suit, saving New York *

City from toxic—induced villains.
“The Amazing Spider-Man” works
to transform this beloved superhero
into an even more complex version
of the already epic ﬁgure.

Peter Parker (Andrew Garﬁeld),
an intelligent and sarcastic high
school student, falls into unlikely
circumstances when he encounters
his deceased father’s briefcase ﬁlled
with important scientiﬁc inforrna—
tion that could potentially help the
general well-being of humanity.

Though Parker, like most great
outcasts, struggles with his place in
a jock-driven high school, he ﬁnds
some reﬁige in the over-achieving
Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who be-
comes his good-girl love interest.

But because of his inquisitive
cockiness, Parker ﬁnds himself
snooping around his father’s old
workplace, Oscorp, in an attempt to
learn more about his parents’ mys-
terious deaths. There, a radioactive
spider conveniently bites him, which
radically transforms him and leads
this average guy to a lifetime of re-
sponsibility.

The story has Spider-Man work-
ing to save the city’s people from
freaky, mutant—like transformants
created by good—scientist—gone-bad
Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans).

The ﬁlm takes aless-than—impor-
tant member of society and makes
him great —— a classic superhero
transformation that makes Spider-

Man relatable. This normality is one
of the most important aspects of the
Spider-Man character.

With his quick wit, wild reckless-
ness and heroic lack of inhibition,
Spider-Man represents more than
just a comic book ﬁgure —— he is a
tragic hero, destined to do good but
stricken with hatred from the many

his young life from the death of his
parents to that of his Uncle Ben. He
is haunted by emotional ghosts that
drive his actions and force him into
heedlessly responsible behavior.

And this is what makes him such a
recognizable character in every pro-
duction of “Spider-Man,” including

the comic book. He exhibits certain
characteristics possessed by aver-
age human beings, takinghim off the
pedestal of super—heroity and placing
him on a human level. Parker repre-
sents an average guy who becomes
something spectacular — a quiet
dream of most hopeﬁil people.

But still, this vigilante superstar
cannot furmel his nighttime self into
his day-to—day personality. With his
bug—shaped mask, he develops a
cocky, antagonistic alter ego that
badgers the cops and plays tricks on
criminals.

Like other comic book characters,
the man behind the mask is driven
to become something great because
of his troubled past, and though his
conﬁdence radiates as he swings
from cranes and climbs buildings,
deep-seeded insecurities existwithin
the spandex.

Andrew Garﬁeld takes this role
and literally soars (he has many high-
ﬂying scenes fromvarious New York
City buildings), developing the char-
acter into a lifelike representation of
the comic book. As Parker, he acts

impressively well, creating a new
twist on an old character. Garﬁeld’s
snarky attitude and natural sarcasm

comes out in Parker’s character more
so than in past productions, and his
portrayal of Spider-Man is especially
haughty.

Emma Stone portrays the role

of innocent Gwen Stacy with an-

awkward grace that demonstrates
the young demeanor of this studi-
ous girl. But even this character has
strong moments where she bravely
confronts the villain in an attempt
to assist her super-"spider boyfriend.

The two have great on—screen
chemistry that stems from their

off-screen relationship. As a pair,-

the actors bring a more emotionally

' charged performance that helps to

increase the ﬁlm’s content.

Visually, the ﬁlm excels, tum-
ing the city into a playground for
its greatest performer. Spider-Man
ﬂails magically and with ease across
the city’s heights, making his perfor-
mance seem more like acrobatic ex-
cellency than enhanced visual effects.

With each ﬁght scene the visual
appeal increases, and by the end,
Spider-Man’s heroic prowess dy-
namically sweeps the audience into
awe, thoroughly impressed with the
athleticism, even iftechnology aided
in his skill and ﬂawless appearance.

“The Amazing Spider—Man”
shows viewers that even a nerdy
guy with a cocky attitude and a ra-
dioactive spider bite can become a
superhero.

And with all that pent-up angst
and heroic desire inside his spandex
suit, this superhero makes responsi-
bility look good. j

Independent production
spreads through media

Thomas Visco
PVPTS Contributor

Many people claim they are fans of
indie music.

But they might not know the
word’s signiﬁcance. An initial exami-
nation makes the term ‘indie,’ short
for independent, seem astrange title
for a music genre. After all, there is
no dependent music genre out there,
or “dependie” for short.

Indie music is synonymous
with artists that write, record and
distribute music outside of the
“mainstream” music industry. This
mainstream industry (whichl see no

‘reason to vilify the way some do -
everyone loves “Call Me Maybe”) is
composed of major record conglom-
erates that are often more concerned
with proﬁts than artistry. Indie music
attempts to isolate the most impor-
tant aspects of music —— the creative,
artistic act of musical development
—- without necessarily striving for
mainstream success. Although some
artists achieve such popularity any-
way, their driving commitment to
artistic integrity has kept indie music
relevant and has even lead to inde-
pendent creation in other industries.

Indie music took off in the 1980s
as a response to the hair metal and
glam rock that then dominated the
music industry. Fostered by college
radio stations across the country,
bands such as R.E.M and The Smiths
began bringing a new sort of rock

music to audiences in both the U.S.
and U.K. These bands gained popu-
larity primarily with a younger,

university-level audience.

This all changed in the 1990s.
“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” the icon-
ic song by popular band Nirvana,
brought indie rock — in this case
grunge — into mainstream success.
Being in an indie group no longer
meant a limited audience.

But the idea of generating art or
entertainment media independent-
ly from the corporate sponsors of
mainstream production is not con-
ﬁned to music. Independent ﬁlms
have a long history of success in the
U.S. Especially after the creation of
the Sundance Institute and its annual

ﬁlm festival, the popularity of indie -

ﬁlms exploded.

Many movies that first aired at
this festival are now well-established
parts of our popular movie culture.
“Saw,” “Garden State,” “The Blair
Witch Project” and “Clerks” all re-

ceived attention because of the expo— -

sure they garnered at the Sundance
Film Festival and eventually went on
to mainstream success. V

Even though mainstream distri-
bution companies produce some of
these movies that are screened at
the ﬁlm festival —— most notably Li-
onsgate, who distributes “Saw” — it
is important that these ﬁlmmakers
seek the approval of an indie com-
munity at Sundance.

The video game industry is the
newest frontier for independent
production. This past decade has
witnessed tremendous growth in the
video game industry. Mainstream

Dress cool to stay hot this summer

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

We can’t all be bronzed gods and goddesses.

Some of us are meant for that classic, cov-
ered—up kind of beauty. g

Despite the scantily~clad sunbathers loung-
ing on every grassy patch from here to Carlow
University during the summer, tan isn’t the
ideal. You’ve heard it a thousand times — wear
sunscreen, don’t stay in the sun or you’ll start
to look like that leather wallet, etc.

No matter how dark you are, too much sun
exposure damages and breaks down your skin
and hair, can give you cancer and will almost
certainly make you appear older.

Melanin is what gives your hair pigment
and protects you from the sun by absorbing
the UVA/UVB rays. You burn when there are
too many for your melanin to fully absorb. But
even if you aren’t burning, you’re doing wrinkle
and spot-causing damage.

As for your hair, that natural lightening ef-
fect happens when the pigment inyour hair gets
broken down protecting the proteins in your
hair from the sun. So while you’re lightening,
you’re also damaging.

So you need to protect yourself.

That means sunscreen — preferably with
micro zinc oxide, which will stop wrinkle-
causing UVA rays. SPF depends on your skin
color. Everyone should wear at least SPF 15, but
if you’re paler, you should be usingahigher SPF.

You can also look for clothes with high UPF
(ultraviolet protection factor) ratings. Even if
clothing doesn’t explicitly state its UPF rating,
it might have one. A regular T—shirt has a UPF
of about 5, which isn’t particularly high, but
still gives some protection.

And sometimes the best sun protection
means wearing more clothes. Think loose and
breezy woven fabrics that will keep you looking
and feeling cool in the sun.

From top-to-bottom:

Hats
With the ’7os look of high—waisted pants

and shorts back in style, consider incorporat-
ing an adorable sunhat of the same era. A brim

that’s 3 to 5 inches the whole way around will .

do wonders to protect your face. And some hats
even come with extra sun protection, so you can
look for that in your hat shopping.

Sunglasses

Make sure these have UVA/UVB protection.
Sunglasses that are tinted but do not protect
against ‘these rays will actually do more dam-
age. Your eyes dilate behind the dark lenses,
and if your specs don’t block UVA/UVB rays,
they’ll let more into your eye than you would
have gotten without glasses at all.

Top

They might seem intolerable in the heat,
but long sleeves can do wonders to keep your

arms out of the light. And they’re not as bad
as they seem. '
Gauzy materials such as linen were made

to wear in the heat of summer. Breezy cottons —

and other breathable fabrics will also be toler-
able andwill protectyou from the beating sun.
There are fabrics you can buy that have high
UPF ratings, if you’re really dedicated.

Just make sure to wear things in light colors
— remember, black will absorb heat.

Bottom

The bottom isn’t quite as problematic for
many people, since pants and long skirts in
summer aren’t unusual. Consider rocking a
long skirt —- it’s in vogue and won’t be too hot.

Again, think light linens and cotton —

something heavy will leave you sweating and

grossly unhappy. ﬂ

titles such as “Call of Duty” and the “Madden” V.
football series are well—known pieces of popular

culture. But indie games such as “Amnesia:
The Dark Descent” and “Mount & Blade” have
achieved critical acclaim for their artistic value,

despite the lack of huge production budgets. i

Independent developments ig music, ,
and gamingﬁllan important role iE6ur culture.
Despite achieving mainstream success, indie
music has carved a niche into popular culture
for those who care about music beyond pop
success. Indie ﬁlms prove that motion picture
proﬁts are possible without huge special-effects
budgets or ensemble casts, and the indepen-
dent sphere even extends to video games.

Indie producers continue to remind us that
there is still an artistic core to entertainment
production. I

(.

A few weeks ago, Pitt fans expecting

to see James Robinson play on the 1

opening night of the Pittsburgh Bas-
ketball Club Pro—Am summer league
at Greentree were disappointed that
whe didn’t show up. But that disap-
pointment quickly faded when they
found out that the incoming Panthers
freshman point guardwas absentbe-
cause he was busy playing on another
continent in a much more important

game.

' 9* Robinson was with Team USA at

the 2012 FIBA Americas Under-18
Championship in Sao Sebastiao, Bra-
zil, in late June, where he averaged
4.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.4 as-
sists per game as the American squad

. mgruised to the gold medal with domi-

nating wins in all ﬁve of its contests.

But more important than the
numbers for Robinson, who hopes
he can follow in the steps of Brandin

Knight, Carl Krauser, Levance Fields
and current Pitt seniorTray Woodall
to become the next great Pitt point
guard, is the experience he gained
playing alongside some of the na-
tion’s best young players, as well as
playing for some of college basket-
ball’s best coaches inTeam USA’s'head
coach Billy Donovan from Florida
and assistants Mark Few of Gonzaga
and Shaka Smartfromvirginia Com-
monwealth.

“I think [playing for the U—18
team] was a good head start for me,
playing under Coach Donovan, Coach
Smart and Coach Few,” Robinson said
of the experience. “They ran their
practices and their workouts how
[Pitt] would run [its] practices and
workouts, so I think that gave me
a little preview of how [Pitt] coach
[Jamie] Dixon runs things here in
Pittsburgh.”

Robinson, who was ranked as the
fourth-best player at his position in
the most recent recruiting class by

ESPN, also added that the most im-
portantthinghe took awayfrom the
experience of playingunderthe three
coaches was “consistency, and just
pushing through because everyone’s
going to be tired and sore, but just
having the mindset to push through
and persevere.”

Donovan, a winner of back-to-
back national championships in
2006 and 2007 as head coach of

Florida, chose Robinson to be on . 1

Team USA after holding tryouts in
Colorado Springs, Colo., in earlyJune.
He believes the young point guard
willﬁtinperfectly at Pittwith Dixon’s
team.

“Once we started practicing, we
saw that he’s a winner and a great
role guy. He’s atypical Pitt player.Ja—
mie [Dixon] will love coaching him,”
Donovan said in an interview with
ESPN°s Andy Katz. “People will say,
‘Where did this guy come ﬁ'om?’ The

The Pittsburgh Basketball Club
Pro-Am summer league began its
ﬁnal week of regular-season ac-
tion onJuly 9, and the hundreds of
fans who once again showed up at
the Greentree SportsPlex enjoyed
three back-and—forth matchups
involving several members of the
Pitt men’s basketball team.

Steel City Tickets 78, SPK Law 77

Prior to Monday’s game against
SPK, Steel City Tickets held a 0-4
record in the summer league de-
spite a string of solid performances
by Pitt redshirt freshman Durand
Johnson.

Displaying a potentially explo-
sive scoring touch, Johnson wowed
during each of his team’s losses.

But this time, no one was stop-
pingJohnson.

After watching his team trail for
nearly the entire game, Johnson
scored on a reverse layup with four
seconds left in the game to give his
team its ﬁrst win of the summer
league. -

Johnson, who scored 18 points
with ﬁve rebounds and six assists,
said he thought he played well in
the game but still has plenty of

room for improvement.

“I think I played good. I could
deﬁnitely play a lot better, though,”
Johnson said. “I missed a few shots,
and I missed a few free throws, so
I’m going to work on that for the
next game on Wednesday.” -

-Pitt senior Dante Taylor also
turned in a solid performance for
Steel City Tickets, scoring 18 points
with 18 rebounds to notch his ﬁrst
double-double of the league’s regu-
lar season. Pitt redshirt junior Talib
Zanna scored 14 points and pulled
down eight rebounds for SPK Law,
who fell to 1-4.

PGT Trucking 67, 0liverio’s Pep-
pers 56

PGT, a team consisting pri-
marily of Pitt players, once again
showed that it might be the league’s
most talented team as it improved
its record to 4-1.

After falling behind 7-0 early
in the game, PGT stormed back

with an 18-0 run shortly after and

held the lead for the remainder of
the contest.

Incoming Pitt freshman Steven
Adams, a consensus top-ﬁve re-
cruit, scored 11 points with 11 re-
bounds despite committing a large
number of fouls. Fellow incoming

kid is avvinner. I liked coaching him. He was the
same guy every day.”

Since winningthe gold medal, Robinson has
returned to Pittsburgh to compete at Greentree
on the PGT Trucking team alongside ﬁiture Pitt
teammates Lamar Patterson, Steven Adams
and Trey Zeigler.

In four games played, Robinson averaged
seven points, four rebounds and three assists
per game while running the point and guiding
PGT to a 4-1 record.

Robinson believes that even though the
summer league games don’t count, they have
helped him begin to establish rapport with his
teammates and smooth his transition into the
Pitt basketball program.

“It’s good for us to build chemistry,” Rob-
inson said of playing with Patterson, Adams
and Zeigler at Greentree. “We’re having ﬁin,
but at the same time, we are building chemistry
together and just competing against some of
the best players around this area.”

From Brazil to Greentree, Robinson has

 

already exhibited a number of qualities and
capabilities that will make him a valuable player
in Dixon’s rotation this season.

As a true point guard, Robinson, who aver-
aged 11.2 points and 6.4 assists duringhis senior
season at DeMatha, not only keeps the team
in the ﬂow of its offense, but also initiates that
ﬂow by making good passes and rarely turning
the ball over.

And defensively, he can keep up in man-to-
man situations and knows how to play off the
ball, as his eight rebounds per game in high
school proves.

Along with numerous Pitt fans, Robinson is
also receiving attention from past Pitt greats,
namely Fields (2005-2008), one of the best
point guards in school history.

“James [Robinson] is going to be a bright
spot for [Pitt] moving forward,” Fields said
afterwatching him play at Greentree. “He learns
quick — he soaks everything up like a sponge.
He’s really elite. He makes the right plays.”

Fields’ endorsement is all Pitt fans should
need to know that Robinson has the potential
to maintain Pitt’s strong recent history of pro-
ducing tremendous talent at the point guard
position. 3

CREENTREE

Panther freshmanjames Robinson displayed

a steady presence on the ﬂoor, scoring eight
points and adding three assists.

' Robinson, who was ranked as one of the A

top point guards in.the nationcoming out of
high school, said he thought he played well
even though PGT temporarily lost its focus
during the game.

“We’ll take the win any way we can get
it,” Robinson said. “We kind of let them back
into it, especially in the second half, but we
were fortunate to get the win.”

Pitt redshirt junior Lamar Patterson
added 16 points and eight rebounds, and
Trey Zeigler, an offseason transfer for Pitt
from Central Michigan University, scored
15 points for PGT. ,

Zanna, playing in his second game of the
night, scored nine points and grabbed 13
rebounds for Oliverio’s Peppers.

South Hills Audi 85, UPMC 80

During his time at Pitt, Levance Fields

was known as a player who picked his team-
mates up when they needed him the most.
His step-back 3-pointer at the buzzer that
clinched victory for the Panthers against
Duke at Madison Square Garden in 2007 re~
mains one of the more memorable moments
in recent Pitt basketball history.

On Monday night, Fields returned to
Pittsburgh to lead South Hills Audi, a team
made up of alumni from Pitt and other local
colleges, to a narrow victory over UPMC.

Fields, who scored 23 points and added
six assists, said he cherished the opportunity
to play with some of his former teammates
like Gilbert Brown, Keith Benjamin andjohn
DeGroat.

' “I had some fun with some old team-
mates, and that’s all I really wanted to do,”
Fields said.

DeGroat added 20 points and 10 re-
bounds for South Hills Audi, while Brown
and Benjamin scored 15 and 10 points, re-
spectively.
