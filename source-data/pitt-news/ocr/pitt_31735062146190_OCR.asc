In former years Pitt has been repre- .

sented by strong tennis teams, but
last year the‘ interest died down, due
to the unrestlessne-ss caused by the
war and the large number of students
leaving for the colors. In previous
years‘ Pitt played many of the Eastern
colleges on the court——Princeton, Yale,

,Harvard, Pennsylvani_a, Lafayette, Le-

REVEREND STANLEY HUNTER
SPEAKS BEFORE v. w. C.-A.

 

Rev. Stanley Hunter, of the North
Avenue Presbyterian ‘ Church, spoke
to the girls of the Y. W’. C. A. last
Thursday on “Industrial ,Problems.”
He declared that there is unrest all
over the world, not only in Russia and
Germany, but also in the United
States. He also said that there is a
continual struggle between labor and
capital, which will not cease until
Christian principles are applied in in-
dustry. He spoke of the several lead-
ers of the church, who are now de-
voting their time entirely to -“solving
these problems, and of the need for
practical Christianity. ~

The personnel of" Pitt's new public-
ity organization has been completed
by the transfer of J .- Steele Gow,_Co1-
lege ?16,.from the position of head of
the public service department, in the
Extension Division, to that of assist-"
ant publicity director. Gow left the
campus for the city office on April 1.
and is now busy turning out good
copy-—and‘ other things valuable .to
Pitt-'——-at the oﬁice in the _Common-

of O. D. K., which selects its members
on the basis of leadership in under-’

After June, 1916, Gow was employed
for a. time by A. G. Spalding Bros.,

but Pitt needed him, and within a
year he returned to serve as high
school visitor. ,. He later was appointed
head of the public service department
and became Dr. Robertson’s
hand man in the Extension Division,-

present generation as" he was among
his own classmates. During the ab-
sence of the alumni "secretary in the
