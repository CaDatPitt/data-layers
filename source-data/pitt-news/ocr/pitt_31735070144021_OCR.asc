As proﬁts plummet, PN C says don't worry

by Lindsay Carroll
Se/zio/' Sniff W/rite/'

PNC Financial Services Group,
the No. 1 provider of educational
loans to Pitt students, has not been
immune to the nation’s ﬁnancial
crisis.

Pittsburgh’s oldest bank report-
ed that its proﬁts fell 39 percent
in the third quarter, according to
PNC’s Oct. 16 ﬁling for the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission.

Although the company did not
reveal how many students have

PNC accounts, Fred Solomon, .

PNC vice president of corporate
communications, said that PNC
provides more student loans to
Pitt than any other institution.
But Solomon said that the
third—quarter drop in proﬁts would

_ not affect Pitt students and that

the company is doing well despite
a slowdown.

’ “PNC is among the best—per—
forming banks in the country. In
fact, PNC raised its dividend this
year,” said Solomon in an e-mail.
“Our core business.activities c1e~

livered solid results in the quarter
despite a difficult economy.”

Neither Solomon nor Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele would dis-
close speciﬁc information about
Pitt’s corporate relationship with
PNC. '

“We do not expectany changes
in our relationship with PNC,”
said Fedele, referring to the proﬁt
losses. 1 ‘S

Stull. OK,

sidelined  

indefinitely

by Zach Chakan
Aadtata/zt Sparta Editor

Pitt junior quarterback Bill
Stull was hurt on Saturday with
5:59 remaining in the third quar-
ter in Pitt’s 54-34 loss to Rutgers.

Stull’s neck had to be immo;
bilized, and he was carted off the
ﬁeld on a stretcher after being
down on the ﬁeld for about 10
minutes. It looked as though he
wasn’t moving, but he raised his
arm and gave a thumbs up as he
was taken off the ﬁeld.

Pitt coach Dave Wannst-

I edt said that testsdone on Stull

showed no severe injury and that
the starting quarterback will be all
right.

Sophomore backup Pat Bo-
stick will ﬁll in for Stull as he
remains out of the lineup indeﬁ-
nitely. .

“The big concern was the
neck,” said Wannstedt. “He
was moving everything ‘initially,
and he was conscious initially. I
thought. our doctors and para»
medics did a great job of not tak-
ing any chances.” '

Stull stayed overnight Satur-
day at UPMC Presbyterian in
Oakland with his family and was
released yesterday morning.

The play occurred midway
through the third quarter with
Pitt trailing, 41-31. On a third-
and—i12, Stull was heavily rushed
by Rutgers defensive back David
Rowe. Stull threw a hurried pass
in the direction of Cedric McGee,
which fell incomplete. But Rowe
hit Stull, and his neck snapped
backward and smacked off of
running back LeSean McCoy.

Pittsburghers have deviating
opinions on whether Western
Pennsylvania is, in fact, a racist

Despite economy, Pitt endo

i by Mike Gladysz
Contri/Iuting E3itor

From New York City to Lon-
don, investors are burying their
heads in their hands, stressing over
the still-slumping stock market
and the effects it has on the world
economy.

Investors at Pitt are doing the
same thing. And their decisions
could inﬂuence anything from the
cost of tuition to the construction
of a new dorm. _

In recent months, the stock
market has plummeted. While
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
the University does not track the
stocks on a daily basis, a continued
drop in the market could mean Pitt
students will feel the results.

Pitt, which has a $2.3 billion
endowment that ranks among the
top 10 in public universities in the
country, has to be just as careful
with its investments as any com-
pany or family.

In its last. ﬁscal year, which
lasted July 1, 2007, through June
30, 2008, the University had no

losses or gains. This goes against

- Pitt’s recent trend of investment

success. Over the last three years,
Pitt has made 11.4 percent on its
investments to help increase the
endowment.

But some people, like Pitt soph-
omore Titilope Akinlose, don’t un-
derstand what the endowment is.

“No idea,” said Akinlose. “I’ve
never even heard of “it.”

Pitt spokesman john Fedele

summed it up best.

“Think of it as a safety net for
the University,” said Fedele.

The endowment consists of all
of the University’s savings and as-
sets, which are spread around into
separate investment pools. In the
last decade, the endowment has
helped to steadily increase schol-
arships, fellowships, V chairs and
professors. It also helps to bring
about new construction and proj-
ects. There are 398 more endowed
scholarships today than there were
in 1997.

The endowment fuels’ the Uni-
versity, Fedele said. And unless the
endowment grows, these things

lematic products,” he said.

Solomon suggested - that students use
features like PNC’s AutoAlerts, a program
that sends e-mails when an account balance
falls below a speciﬁed limit.

“We urge students to take advantage of
the tools available to help them manage their

ﬁnances,” he said. ' "

He did not give other examples of how
students can protect their ﬁnances in the
economic climate.. ‘ '

On Friday, the company reported that it
bought National City Corporation, based in

— Cleveland, Ohio. PNC acquired the compa-

ny at $2.23 per share, or $5.2 billion in .PNC
stock, according to a press release posted on
the Securities and Exchange Commission
Web site. The acquisition will make PNC the
ﬁfth largest bank in terms of deposits. .

A slideshow presentation included in the
Commission’s  said that PNC does
not know exactly what to expect from the
merger. '

“Our ability to achieve anticipated results

from this transaction is dependent on the

state of the economic and ﬁnancial mar-
kets going forward, which have been under
signiﬁcant stress recently,” said the release.
“Specifically, we may incur more credit loss-

- es from National City’s loan portfolio than

expected.”

PNC’s stock went up two points in
value after Friday’s merger, although it had
dropped from 72.81 points on Sept. 26 to
56.88 points on Oct. 22.

PNC also bought Sterling Financial Cor-
poration and Yardville National Bancorp in
the past year._

Nearly $100 million worth of

endowment funds reinvested

Endowment, page 3

could be cut.

Pitt’s endowment grew steadily in the last
ﬁve years because of two main factors, Fedele
said. The ﬁrst way the endowment can make
money is from successful investments. The
second means of expansion is Pitt’s capital
campaign, which is showing steady success
and is a big part of Pitt’s plan for the future.
Fedele said Pitt hopes the capital campaign,
which promotes donations and other ways
of fundraising, will raise $2 billion.

Still, much of the endowment relies on
successful investments. Roughly 18 percent
-4 or about $41 million — of the endow-
ment is invested into marketable alternatives,
while 20 percent is invested in domestic eq-
uity. Domestic equity is described as stocks
in U.S. companies.

Investments like these are the ones that
have been up and down recently —— not just
for Pitt — but for people all across the coun-
try. Fedele said the University does not track

the stocks week by week, so he could not I

comment on the amount of money Pitt lost
or gained in the past month. Still, he said the
market was not looking good.

To avoid the chance of losing large sums
of money with the market in its current state,
Pitt’s plan has been one of market diversity.
And according to Sara Moeller,’ an associate
professor of business at Pitt, there are still
some safe bets in the market.

“It’s not like all things are down,” said
Moeller. “There are still some places you can
invest that can get you guaranteed return.”

Some of these include bonds and cer-
tiﬁcates of deposit, which are commonly re-
ferred to as CD5, and they give the purchaser
an expected rate of return that is generally
guaranteed. Ten percent of the University’s

current investments lay in ﬁxed income.

Because the endowment acts as a safety
net, the University is generally not allowed to
dip into the endowment to start new proj-
ects. So that means the money that it makes
off of investments or donations become all
the more crucial.

For example, if Pitt makes a 10 percent
profit on a $500,000 investment, it’ll have
$50,000 that could go to use for a new proj-
ect. That money could be distributed in any
number of ways. Still, it’s money that can be
used. But if the investment makes no money,
it can’t be touched.

“[The University] can’t allow for the prin-
ciple to go down,” said Fedele.

For the most part, the money has been
there for new projects. But economist Chris
Briem, who does research at Pitt’s Center for
Social and Urban Research, said that even
if the endowment is making money, it’s not
making nearly as much as it would be if the
market were growing.

He added that the cuts the University
might have to make after a loss of money
translates to what happens to the city in gen-
eral.

Briem said job loss in addition to business
failures and less building are all common ef-
fects of money loss.

Whﬂe Moeller said there are some invest-
ments that can be safe, she added that mak-
ing strong investments these days is difﬁcult.
And if a certain investor is looking to make a
lot of money off of an investment, it needs
to be willing to take some risks.

“The higher the risk, the higher the re-
turn,” said Moeller. “The risk allows the big-

ger return. But you have to worry about los— .

ing [money], too.”

While some refute Western

Murtha, page 

Western Pennsylvania.

“I think Murtha was spot on with what
he said that. People don’t want to hear the
truth -— that’s what he is guilty of and thus
is going to pay a price for it,” said Crisci.

Crisci said that race is not a proper judge
of a person’s character and that elections
should focus on what’s important as op-
posed to the color of the candidates’ skin.

Pitt junior Lee Merrill agreed with Frey.
He said that the Pittsburgh area isn’t racist.

“I don’t think Pittsburgh is racist, but I

Pa. ‘racist’ label, issue not dead

do think Western and Central Pennsylvania
are. To me Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, with Alabama right in the rnid—
dle of both cities,” said Merrill.

Merrill said that race will have a bearing
on the upcoming election because it is the
ﬁrst time a black man is running for presi-
dent and the ﬁrst time this barrier is pos-
sibly going to be broken.

The American Civil Liberties Union de-
clined to comment on whether Murtha’s
comments had any factual basis.

Down to the wire

Candidates come to Pennsylvania  

to win crucial votes

Eight days from now, people
across the country are going to
elect either Sen. John McCain or
Sen. Barack Obama as the next
president of the United States.
Eight days might not seem like a
long time, but according to both
candidates it’s long enough to
change the outcome of the entire
election, and Pennsylvania could
be at the center of that swing.

Both Obama and McCain are
putting heavy efforts into win-
ning Pennsylvania during the
next week. Obama is speaking
in Mellon Arena this afternoon,
and McCain is making campaign
stops in Pottsville, Quakertown
and Hershey today and tomor-
row.

“We have to win Pennsyl-
vania  So we’re going to do
everything we can,” said Tom
Ridge, former Pennsylvania gov-
ernor and a national co—chair of
the McCain campaign, at a Fri-
day press conference. The next
week is shaping up to turn the
state into a massive battleground
as McCain tries to chip away at
Obama’s lead.

Regardless of the polls, both
candidates are obviously prepar-
ing for a close race. McCain guar-
anteed victory in an interview
with Tom Brokaw on NBC’s
“Meet the Press” yesterday, but
he also said that “it’s going to be
tight, and we’re going to be up
late.”

According to most polls in the
state, that lead could be as high
as 13 percentage points, and Re-
alClearPolitics’ average of Penn-
sylvania polls gives Obama a 10.8
percent lead. And though these
polls aren’t deﬁnitive, all the sta-
tistics are well outside the margin
of error, meaning Obama’s lead
in Pennsylvania is more than just
a statistical anomaly.

Obama’s national lead is less
secure —- as few as 5 percentage

points according to some polls,
but as high as 12 points in others.
Several of these results are close
to — though still outside —- the
margin of error, so Obama’s
lead could be as low as just a few
points.

McCain staffers have also
said that he must: win Pennsylva-
nia, Wisconsin or Minnesota to
have enough votes in the Elec-
toral College to win the election.

Of these three, Pennsylvania’s 21 V

votes trump Wisconsin’s 17 and
l\/Iinnesota’s 10, a fact that could
give it particular importance to
McCain’s campaign.

With Election Day so close,
it’s easy for voters to think that
the race is over and to lose en-
thusiasm, but both candidates
are staying active to try and de-
feat the competition. I

And it’s important for voters

not to fall victim to election fa— V

tigue and simply let the coverage
wash over them.

Regardless of which candi-
date you’re planning to vote for,
the importance of remaining
active and encouraging partici-
pation can’t be understated, es-
pecially in a major battleground
state a week away from the elec-
tion. '

Both Obama and McCain
supporters are going to have to
ﬁght for a win here next Tues-
day, as both of the candidate’s
actions can attest. They wouldn’t
be here if they thought the state
was a lock.

In an election as long as this
one — it’s been nearly two years
since the primary election cam-
paigns began — losing focus and
getting tired of politics is not
only possible, it’s likely for the
majority of voters. With only a
week left, in such a key state in
an enormously important elec-
tion, being active has never been
more important.

You don’t have to be crazy
or stupid to support Sen. John
McCain. The McCain campaign
has started to believe otherwise,
though, speciﬁcally targeting the
“crazy and stupid” voting bloc in
recent weeks, with Real America,
Bill Ayers and the joe the Plumb-
er Tour. It’s this anti-intellectual
bent that forced Colin Powell to
abandon the Republicans.

But it’s a bad thing for our de-

mocracy when the idea of a plau-
sible choice is absurd. I don’t sup-
port McCain, but today I’d like to
explain why sane and intelligent

‘people might.

1. Health care. If you get
cancer or break your hip or carve
a backward ‘B” into your face,
who will be there to pick up the
bill? McCain’s plan is to give the
same tax subsidy to health insur-
ance, whether it’s bought by in-
dividuals or employers. The idea
is that if more workers buy their
own plans, competition will cut
costs.

That’s the idea, and you can

disagree. Maybe you believe peo-
ple are too crazy to buy insurance:
Even today, half the uninsured
can afford it. Maybe you believe
people are too stupid to be savvy
health consumers: McCain’s re-

% é , _

Voting against your
party on tax cuts and
against the elderly
on an thing is a dif-
ﬁcult clioice. It would
appear that McCain
conditions his spend-
ing votes, although not
necessarily his words,
on principles.

gime would popularize cheap,
high-deductible plans that rely on
shopping around. But whatever
you believe, please recognize that
one doesn’t have to be crazy or
stupid to think that people aren’t
too crazy or too stupid for _Mc—
Cain’s plan to work.

Here’s a quote from a repu-
table economist: I

“The most promising way

to move forward in all three di-
mensions — coverage, cost and
long-run ﬁscal situation — is
to replace the employer exclu-
sion with a tax credit  Firms
would still be allowed to deduct
the cost of their contributions to
employee premiums, just as they
can deduct wages and other ex-
penses today for the purpose of
calculating taxable income. But

A workers would now have to in-

clude employer contributions to
health insurance in their earnings
for the purpose of calculating
taxes  In exchange for, workers
who purchased qualifying insur-
ance would get a refundable tax
credit.”

The reputable economist who
wrote this in February 2008 is Ja-
son Furman. Since then, Obama
tapped Dr. Furman as his eco-
nomic policy director. Crazy!‘

2. Government Debt. McCa-
in voted against President Bush’s
tax cuts twice, arguing that tax
cuts without spending cuts aren’t
really tax cuts at all, just ways of
shifting current spending to later
on. He also felt that the tax cuts
were too slanted. In a floor state-
ment during the Senate debate on

Election loss the ultimate forehead "L"

by Ben Korman
Colum/ultt

I’ve been competitive to a fault
for as long as I can remember.
When I played hide—and—seek as
a child, I always avoided hiding in
the kitchen or garage so that there
wouldn’t be an assortment of sharp
objects lying around with which I
might impulsively maim an inno-
cent seeker in an act of uninhibited
frustration when they found me.

I can’t say I can trace the original
source of my debilitating competi-
tiveness, but I’m pretty sure that the
fear of losing has something to do
with it. For instance, when my Lit-
tle League coach would promise us
a pizza party if we won, I’d always
ask, “But if we lose, coach?” He’d
then take me by the hand, walk
me over to the bleachers and ask,
“Whose smart aleck kid is this?”

“Go Mudcats?” my mom would

say.
, So as you might expect, I can’t
help but dwell on the often-ignored
fate of the loser of the upcom-
ing presidential election. I haven’t
heard either candidate start a sen-
tence with “If I lose.” With Sen.

Obama, it’s always, “If I win, I’m.

going to do this.” Then Sen. McCa-
in rebuts, “And if I win, I’m going
to do that.” For once, though, I’d
like to hear about the elephant —
or donkey — in the room: failure.

If Obama loses, what will be-
come of all his loyal supporters?
What are they going to do with all
that hope and change they’ve been
stockpiling for the past 20 months?
Put it in storage for another four
years? Please. Everybody knows
that change is a dish best served
piping hot, like a good kugel.

And what about all those inspi-
rational “Yes We Can” chants? If I
had been involved in such a chorus
even once, I’d be asking myself a

lot of serious questions in the event
of an Obama loss. _

For instance, I might be with a
very special lady friend, and she’d
ask me if I could try doing some-
thing she’d seen in a certain inde-
pendent ﬁlm. I’d start to say “Yes,
I can,” but I’d then catch myself
right there in the middle and re-
member what happened the last
time I uttered that phrase. I’d stop
and think, “But we couldn’t.” And
there goes the very special lady
friend right out the door, never to
be seen or heard from again.

Speaking of which, what would
Michelle Obama  of her hus-
band if he loses? That’s got to be
awkward. What do you tell your
wife when you lose your campaign
for the presidency?

“It’s OK, honey. The presiden-V"

tial bedroom isn’t all it’s cracked
up to be. I heard a rumor that the
White House maids use generic
brand fabric softener.”

Luckily, Barry isn’t alone in this
predicament — McCain isn’t look-
ing at a particularly peachy post-
election tenure either.

Sure, his rhetorical flogging of
the term “my friends” might very
well earn him a couple of votes
in the coveted friendless people
demographic. But if the senator
from Arizona is indeed thwarted,

he’ll soon have 50 million defunct"

supporters  theyfre also
his best buddy. Remember that

kid in junior high who always sat
with your crew at lunch because he
thought you were pals, but in reality
he just made you really uncomfort-
able all the time? If McCain loses,
I predict he’ll see 50 million of his
fellow countrymen in that light by
May 2009.

Though, perhaps the biggest is-
sue that the losing candidate faces
is what to do with his now-obso-
lete plans for bettering the nation.
Obama has spent countless hours

of his valuable elitist time perfect-
ing what he sees as a foolproof
health care plan. McCain has prob-
ably made the ultimate sacriﬁce by
staying up past 9 p.m. at least twice
amending his tax policy.

Is all their hard work for naught?
I say: not by a long shot The loser
could make a  just typing up
his old proposals in Word docu-
ments and selling them to Internet
essay mills.

Then, once the nation’s high
school social studies teachers start
seeing 42-page expositions on the
pitfalls of earmarking in 11—grade
term papers, they’d ask their stu-
dents, “Did you guys really think
that I wouldn’t recognize this as the
work of a presidential also-ran?”

And they’d respond, “Go Mud-
cats?”

Sane, intelligent people might still vote for McCain

Lehe, page 6

the 2001 tax cut bill, McCain said,
“I cannot in good conscience
support a tax cut in which so
many of the beneﬁts go to the
most fortunate among us at the
expense of rniddle-class Ameri-
cans who need tax relief.”

Then McCain voted against
Bush’s Medicare Part D prescrip-
tion drug plan, because the gov-
ernment was ﬁghting a war and
running a large deﬁcit and still
didn’t have money saved to meet
even its present obligations to se-
nior citizens.

Voting against your party on

tax cuts‘ and against the elderly
on anything is a difﬁcult choice.
It would appear that McCain
conditions his spending votes,
although not necessarily
words, on principles. You might
believe otherwise — that McCain
is a faux—maverick, a con — but
please recognize that a reason-
able person could see these votes
as evidence to the contrary.

3. The war in Iraq. _McCain
has been lambasted for his sup-
port of the war. But his motiva-
tion is clear: He doesn’t want to
pull out and leave a failed state

his

unable to prevent. ethnic cleans-
ing. The divide between the two
candidates is not so much how
soon a majority of our troops
should leave Iraq —— in both cases
the answer is clearly “as soon as
possible.” What we-see is a differ-
ence on how likely it is that the
Iraqi state would collapse. If you
think it is unlikely, go ahead and
support Obama, but please rec-
ognize that it’s not bizarre specu-
lation that makes McCain want to
maintain troops in Iraq.

4. Globalism. McCain is ar-
guably the leader of anti-nativist

forces within the Republican Par-
ty. He coauthored a liberal imrni—
gration agenda, and he supports
free trade. Obama supports im-
migration but won much of his
ground in the ' primary bashing
Sen. Clinton on NAFTA, mak-
ing his position something like,
“I want to give Mexican citizens
jobs, but only the Mexican citi-
zens inside of America.”

McCain also supported al-
lowing Dubai to buy a British
company that manages American
ports. Nativist Republicans and
Democrats derided the measure

as unpatriotic. But McCain stood
fast against this economic ethnic
proﬁling of Arabs, just as he re-
frained from the .China-bashing
that invigorated Clinton so much.
For Americans who like foreign-
ers treated as equals, these ten-
dencies are assuring.

This column won’t sway any-
one toward McCain. But if it
stops Obama supporters from
mocking someone for support-
ing McCain, I won’t feel crazy for
writing it.

- Ornette Coleman

by Samantha Stahl
Staff W/rite/'

Gentle streams of steam cas-
caded from the factories populat-
ing the Pittsburgh skyline. Inside,
nearly half the country’s steel was
in production. The year was 1920.
America was celebrating World

“War I victory, enjoying pre—Depres-

sion prosperity with the rise of jazz
culture.  among Pittsburgh’s
smoke and steel were some of the
nation’s most inﬂuential jazz musi-
cians, gaining momentum to leave
their mark on the music world.
Outside of Pennsylvania, the
jazz industry was growing rap-
idly on the East Coast. The The-
ater Owners Bookers Association
formed “The Circuit,” a circle of
cities that hosted white—owned
clubs but hired only black artists.
The lineup went from Buffalo,
N.Y., to Washington, D.C., to Bal-

timore to Chicago.

“Pittsburgh was a conve-
nient stop—over,” said Nathan
Davis, an acclaimed jazz musi-
cian and Pitt’s director of jazz
studies. “You have to remem-
ber: They didn’t travel by jet.”

As the nation’s greats made their
way to  in Chicago, they stayed

"They had a nickname for the
city: 'Little l-'Iarlern.' A lot of
really great musicians came
out of there."

and  them the opportunity to
play-

Pittsburgh was a musical pow-
erhouse, pumping out artists at a
rate that rivaled the big cities.

“For a city its size, Pittsburgh
produced more jazz innovators
than any other. It wasn’t because it
was in the  water — it was
the people passing throug ,” said
Davis. “They had a nickname for
the city: ‘Little Harlem.’ There was
an emphasis on black culture. They
had clubs all over the place, primar-
ily in the Hill District. A lot of really
great musicians came out of there.”

Davis explained that among
the most signiﬁcant clubs was the
Crawford Grill. “Almost anybody
in jazz anywhere, even big names,
came to the Crawford G ' .”

In the first wave of Pittsburgh
elbow—rubbers was Roy Eldridge,
a trumpet player known by his

friends as ‘Little Jazz,’ a nickname
earned for ,his ease in playing any
instrument.

“His sound and style became
synonymous with jazz,” said Da-
vis. “His style inﬂuenced Dizzy
Gillespie —— Dizzy got his style by
listening to the way Roy would play
the trumpet.”

Eldridge wasn’t alone in inﬂu-
encing the greats. Billy Strayhorn,
born in Ohio but raised in Home-
wood, was asked to work with
Duke Ellington shortly after gradu-
ating high school. Davis explained
that “he was what Duke Ellington
called his ‘right arm.’ He thought
just like Duke Ellington and wrote
music just like Duke Ellington. You
could hardly tell the difference. He
was almost like a musical clone.”
“Duke would say, ‘If I’m  a
new composition and I get stuck, I
call Billy and he’ll ﬁnish it and it’ll

  
  

There's a rich az hsto   ll

be just how I would write it.’ That’s
how close they were.”

Another major innovator
was Earl “Fatha” Hines. Born in
Duquesne, he began transforming
jazz piano in the 1930s.

“He played single lines like a
trumpet player because he listened
to Louis Armstrong. He made
the right hand the solo hand and
the left hand the accompaniment.
Before that, everything was two
hands. If you look at the history
of jazz, this style is what everyone
played after him.”

Men weren’t the only ones tear-
ing up the town. As women were
making their way up in society,
earning the right to vote with the
19th Amendment in 1920, they
were also becoming an integral part
of the jazz scene. Many great ladies
of jazz came out of Pittsburgh,
though most went on to other cit-

Christos Mediterranean Grill

130 6th St., Downtown
Sunday-Thursday 11 a.m. — 9 pm.

Try not to walk too fast down
6th Street on your way to the
Steelers game or that show at By-
ham Theater —— you might miss
Christos, a welcoming staple of
Greek food in Pittsburgh.

Christos is what every man
and woman should imagine
when visualizing Greek cuisine.
Not only is it almost near perfect
in its menu, it's also awesome in
its hor-ne—like atmosphere.

As soon as you walk through
the door, one of the servers
shouts from the, other side of
the room, “How many will be
eating with us?”

Not that the shouting takes
away from the atmosphere. Be-
cause the dining room is so small,

these waiters make the restaurant
seem more like your old, Greek
aunt’s house where you go for
lamb every few months rather
than a quick—in—.quick—out “we
want your money” deal.

These people are honest. I re-
ally think that they are just trying
to serve up some excellent food.

While I personally might
have gotten one of the quieter
waiters, he was still friendly and
courteous in his manner. Yet, it’s
easy to compare attendants when
there is one waiter with gray hair
in the back laughing and convers-
ing with the people at his tables
like they were his nephews and
nieces who had come home.

As small as Christos appears
from 6th Street, inside you for-
get about the size issue. The
tables are set up so everyone has
his own bit of personal space,
and holding a private conversa-
tion is not that hard at all —— the
only accompaniment to light
conversation is a soothing Greek
soundtrack. . V

iAnnuals' latest is too varied,
but still such fun

The screaming vocals make an appear- .

ance to contrast . the choral-style back-
ing vocals that bring the song to a close.

The band members take their chances
with a few country—themed tracks like
“Down The Mountain,” where ﬁddles
meet a mainstream power chorus in an
odd composition that brings to mind
chickens on the farm and electric guitars.

“Always Do”.takes the twangy country
style to new heights, adding in an Annu-
als style string element. It’s the country
waa-waa of the electric instruments that
make the echoing vocals seem out of
place. But who can argue with these guys?

This band will do whatever it wants.
As these country tracks fade out, you’re
launched right into an alt-rock song with
“Talking.” That means electric guitar and a
chorus that could have
come from My Chem-

bands out there, but
it’s not what you want
to hear from Annu-
als. It’s the difference
_ between Pablo Honey
CourtesyCavnasback Records Radjohead and OI<
Computer.,_Radiohead. Both albums meet

the standards for being listen-worthy, sure. .

But when you think of Radiohead, do you
think of a rock album, or do you think of
that experimental rock with robot Voices
and haunting Vocals? ' '
Annuals has moved to a new sound,
which is not a bad sound. While it’s
not bad, it also isn’t nearly as interest-
ing as it should be. Maybe that’s just set-

. ting standards too high, but it’s Annuals.

We know what this band ‘can do, so why
not? When you’ve got a good  go-
ing with a unique sound, stick with ‘it.
There’s a glimmer of the Be He Me An-
nuals in there, but mostly, the Annuals of
old has left the building. Now,iit’s a little bit
country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll and a whole
lot of new. i - e I

Pittsburgh's jazz history a deep Well of talent

Jazz history, page 8

ies before creating a strong association with
the area. Singer Lena Horne, for example,
grew up in the Hill District before heading
to New York City to work as a dancer. John
M. Brewer Jr. explained in his book -“Pitts-
burgh Jazz” that Billy Strayhorn had a major
inﬂuence on her vocal methods.

Maxine Sullivan was born in Homestead
but made her vocal claim to fame in New
York City after being discovered by pianist
Claude Thornhill. -She went on to inspire

some of. the best in the business, including
Ella Fitzgerald.

Mary Lou,\X/illiams, whose piano is now
on loan at the Heinz History Center thanks to
Davis, .was “one of the most innovative and
celebrated jazz pianists in history.” She mas-
tered the instrument at an early age and quick-
ly drew attention. Davis said she was a “hell
of a composer and arranger. She was hired
by Duke Ellington, and he sure didn’t need
to hire nobody, so she must’ve been good.”

The people coming and going to and
from Pittsburgh have since become an inte-
gral part of jazz history.

_ “These people are in the history books
for what they do. They are the Bachs and the
Beethovens of their period,” said Davis.

As the 19305 came to a close, the jazz
movement was just getting started. A new
trend would soon begin — bebop —— alter-
ing the sound and meaning of jazz music
forever.

lemon in the name. i
The soup had a sour, tangy lemon taste,

but the main entree immediately made me '

forget any previous troubles of the day.

A combo meal of Moussaka/Tiro-
pita ($9.50) wowed us immediately. The
crusts were golden, warm and ﬂaky, and

the ground beef was moist. This was feel—'

good food.

The Tiropita was absolutely astound-
ing ——- it was worthiburning my tongue
for that first hot, chewy bite. The crunchy,
layered crust was only the prelude that was
to be a smashing combination of so many
cheeses that I could only just sit there and

. melt in its cheesy heaven and reﬂect on

why cheese is a food from God.

Both the Moussaka and Tiropita were
served with a round, minute portion of
rice pilaf and a healthy portion of brocco-
li (although it too was saturated in lemon
dressing, making my face pucker to some
extent). .

Lastly, Galaktobouriko ($3), an egg

custard dessert baked in ﬁlo, was brought

to the table. One more time, I savored the
sweet syrupy sauce and complexly tex-
tured custard and was content.

Christos’s menu is diverse and different
from the Gyro stand on the street. While

you can get a Gyro, a quintessentially

Greek food, in the restaurant, it is ironi-
cally the only item on the menu that isn’t
completely homemade. '
Look beyond‘Gyros —— the restaurant’s
lamb and chicken dishes are scrumptious,

.considering their modest prices from $9

to $15.

Christos isn’t just a place to take your
parents to when they'come in — it’s good
for every occasion. Going to _a show?
Christos. Going on a date? Christos. Cel-
ebrating a birthday? Wine and liquor store
 then Christos!

Or skip the spirits store, because while
I unfortunately am not of legal age and
could not purchase any of it, the fine
homemade wine list had some exquisite
choices that are definitely worth, reading

' OVCL

I’ll certainly "be back to Christos in a
few more years to examinethat list one
more time, but that doesn’t mean I won’t
be back in the next month for some fan-
tastic Greek food and authentically wel-
coming Greek hospitality.

Teel, Rutgers stun Panthers

by Zack Chakan
A1/aiatant Sparta Editor

After ﬁve consecutive victories, Pitt
(52, 2-1 Big East) was attempting to
winits sixthinanowforthe ﬁrsttirne
since 1983. But it never led after 
on its ﬁrst possession, and Rutgers ran
away with a 54-34 win at Heinz Field
on Saturday.

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull was taken
off the ﬁeld on a stretcher with his neck
immobilized after an odd collision with

5:59  the third quarter He
had been down for 10 minutes before
he was carted off.

The No. 17 Panthers couldn’t re-
cover from Stull’s injury, however, and
they gave up a record—breaking day to
Rutgers senior quarterback Mike Teel.

Teel ﬁnished with 361 
and six touchdown passes on only 14
oompletions Five of those touch-
downs came in the ﬁrst half, which
made him the ﬁrst  con-
ference history to accomplish that in a

Big East game

Commentary

Injuries hurt, but Pitt secondary loses the game

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

 

For nearly 10 minutes on Sat-
urday, football didn’t matter any-
more.

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull was
spread out on the ground, motion-
less, while Pitt players frantically
signaled for help from the side-
lines. His family stood up in their
seats_ and began walking toward

the field. The fans were silent as
both teams knelt in unison on their
sidelines and waited.

Moments before, Rutgers’ de-
fensive back David Rowe blitzed
from the left side and drilled Stull,
whose head whipped back and hit
against tailback LeSean McCoy.

The initial worry was Stull’s
neck. And when the paramedics
ﬁnally carted him off the field, his
helmet was still on. He managed

to lift his hand toward the crowd,
 fans and the players on both
teams some hope.

But when Stull left toward the
end of the third quarter, the game
had to continue. Trailing by 10,
sophomore Pat Bostick replaced
Stull and drove Pitt to the Rutgers’
17. But he threw a third-down in-
terception to Kevin Malast that
was returned 74 yards, and Rutgers
scored another touchdown to ﬁn-

ish off Pitt. On the play, Pitt center
Robb Houser went down with a
leg injury that could keep him out
the rest of the season.

But even before that, the game
was over.

Pitt came out of the half trail-
ing, 34-24. The defense appeared
motivated and forced Rutgers
to punt on its first possession of
the half. McCoy found the end
zone for his fourth touchdown of

Pitt men's,

women's

hoops begin

by Adam Littman
Senior Staff Wrtter

Before the Pitt men’s and wom-
en’s basketball teams could start
their annual Blue-Gold scrimmage,
they had to do one  introduce
themselves to their fans.

Yesterday the two teams held
Fan Fest, an afternoon event at the
Petersen Events Center. Members
of the both teams, as well as Pitt
coaches Jamie Dixon and Agnus
Berenato, sat at tables either in the
lobby or the concourse level of the

Pete as fans walked around getting
autographs.
“[The men’s and women’s

teams] have the same fan base,” _

said Berenato. “It’s a great oppor-
tunity to bring out the fans.”

Also hanging around during the
festivities were cheerleaders, mem-
bers of the band and Pitt’s mascot,
Roc.

On the concourse level between
sections'215 and 216 there was an
area for children to play on an in-
ﬂatable jumping jamboree, toss a
football, shoot a basketball or get

arrn.



W"“*~.,

It's a great opportunity to
bring out the fans.

Agnus 
Berenato

But the main draw, unless you’re
a huge fan of  jamborees or
airbrushed paint, was a first chance
to see the men’s and women’s team
in action.

The women’s scrimmage con- ”

sisted of two 12-minute halves,
with the Gold team coming out on
top, 33-31.

Transfer Dixon, Blair shine in men's scrimmage

Hoops, page 13

Sophomore Taneisha Harrison,
who is expected to come off the
bench this year, led all scorers with
14 points. She netted nine while
playing on the Blue team and an-
other ﬁve while a member of the
Gold team.

Senior guard Shavonte Zellous
scored only four, but yesterday
morning was the first day she prac-
ticed since spraining her ankle on
the first day of practice a little more
than a week ago, said Berenato. The
All—American candidate seemed
ﬁne as she played the entire game.

Led by 22 points and 13 re-
bounds by DeJuan Blair, Gold
came out victorious again in the
men’s game, 63-54. The game con-
sisted of two 16-minute halves.

A couple of players making
their Panther debuts also had pro-
ductive days. Freshman Ashton
Gibbs scored 12, Nasir Robinson
scored 11, and junior Jermaine
Dixon, who is in his ﬁrst year at Pitt
after transferring from Tallahassee
Community College, netted 16.

“We’ve got three seniors and

one junior, and he’s a new guy,”
said Pitt coach Jamie Dixon. “\X/e’re
a very young team.” .

Gibbs and Jermaine Dixon are
expected to try to make up for the
loss of Ronald Ramon’s outside
shooting, and both showed they’re
willing to take, and have the ability
to make, the 3—pointer. Gibbs went
two of three on 3-point attempts,
and Dixon was three for ﬁve from
beyond the arc.

“I think we have some good
shooters coming in,” said Dixon.

Seniors Tyrell Biggs and Sam
Young also ﬁnished in double ﬁg-
ures, with 13 and 14, respectively.

Freshman Travon Woodall led
all players with four assists, as well
as ﬁve turnovers. A more mobile
Gary McGhee scored eight to go
with his seven rebounds and two
blocks.

The men’s ﬁrst preseason game
is Sunday at the Pete against Seton
Hill at 4 p.m. The women open up
their preseason, against the Ohio
Legends at home on Nov. 5 at 7
p.m.
