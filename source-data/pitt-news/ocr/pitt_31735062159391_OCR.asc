Open HouseDraws
Crowd of Over 8000

Over 8,000 people crowded the University Open House on Sun-
day, Dec.4, according to J. Edward Ricart of the Dean of Men’s

Office.

The entire Cathedral was thrown open to the public for an III!-
spection of the progress made during the last 25 years.

. Approximately 125 faculty mem-
bers and 300 student aids served
ashosts and guides to direct the
visitors over the Cathedral cam-
pus including Stephen Foster Mem-
orial where the Stephen Foster col-
lection was on display. -

Kn over flow crowd filled th
Heinz Memorial Chapel for the after-
noon worship service. Reve-rend G.
Mason Cochran, of Highland Pres-
byterian Church, an alumnus of the
University, spoke. V g '

Chancellor and Mrs. Rufus Fitz-'
gerald received the guests in the
Commons Room. Refreshments were
served around the fireplaces.

»All of the sixteen Nationality
Rooms on the first floor, in addition
to the Early American Room on the
third floor, were open. Visitors could
tour the higher floors to see dis-
plays by the various departments,
schools, and activities.

A large canopy was stretched
from the street to the Fifth Avenue
Entrance of the University to pro-
tect visitors from the rain.

Last year at two similar Open
Houses about 6000 visitors crowded
into the Cathedral for the inspec-
tion tour. -

Caution Given
On Language

A new foreigh language require-
mentfor College freshmen and trans-
fer students is not being met by all
students concerned, according to
Dr. William H. Shelton, head of the
department of foreign languages.

The ruling which wentinto effect
this semester states that all enter-
ing students who expect to graduate
from the College must complete two
years, college level, of a foreign
language.

This means that students taking
the language placement test must
place in the fifth semester of study.
If no placement test is taken, four
semesters ofione foreign language
must be taken in order to qualify
for graduation from the College.

Freshmen and new transfer stu-
dents whohave not completed the
language requirement by the place-
ment test and not studying a lan-
guage at this time should go to the
foreign language department on the
35th floor for instructions as soon
as possible.

ODK Fetes
T appees

Omicron Delta Kappa’will hold
initiation ceremonies for its 14
new undergraduates and graduate
members tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. in
the Faculty Club, seventeenth
floor Cl. Following the initiation,
members and alumni of ODK will
attend a dinnerin the Faculty Club.

From 85 to 100 ODK alumni have

been invited to attend the cere-
monies and the banquet, according
to Harry Green, banquet chairman.
‘The toastmaster is Mr. Buell White-
hill of the speech department. Will-
iam Swanson,president of ODK will
introduce the new members.

Main speaker will be Dr. Ertman
Harris, headmaster of Shadyside
Academy and recipient of an honor-
ary membership. Dr. Harris was
tapped for his outstanding contri-
bution to the community as a civic
leader.

Dr. Edward D.’ Reif, dean of the
Pharmacy School was tapped to
the other graduate membership in
ODK. He was made an associate
member in recognition of his out-
standing contribution to the Uni-
versity. —

The new undergraduate members
are: Jack Abramson, William Block-
stein, Donald Ewart, David Fox,"
Howard Greenberger, John Ingrim,
Ignatius "Nick” Laux, George
McCrossin, James Mayer, Roy Nel-
son, Robert Newcomer, and Fred
Purdy.

Pleas Court, Phi Kap attorney Rob-
ert A. ‘Jarvis produced letters and
affidavits from 23 outside persons
who were accused of parking in the
private lot. Each of the 23 denied
that he had ever parked _on the lot
‘in question.

This latest hearing is the third
of the case that began on Sept. 28
when next-door neighbors Wilson
and Kirk-Patrick filed suit against
the fraternity to stop petting, offen-
_sive language, and excessive noise
on the Phi Kap property. The park-
ing lot was a minor burn in the
original trouble.

When the case reached court,
however, the sensational charges
against the Phi Kaps were dropped
and both sides fought it out over
the legality of the fraternity park-
ing lot in the rear of their house
at 155 North Dithridge St.

Now in his latest action Jarvis
sought to prove false the charges
of Wilson as expounded by attorney
Ella Graubart that cars of non-
fraternity men were continually
parked in the lot. To do this, Wil-
son systematically copied license
plate numbers of the cars which he
claimed were in the lot and pre-
sented them to the court as evi-
dence. .

Jarvis, on checking the ﬂames
on file for the numbers, discovered
that some of the drivers lived as
far away as Philadelphia and that
23 had never been near the lot.

Asked about the probable date
for the decision on the case, Jar-
vis answered that all briefs con-
cerning the trial have not yet been
filed. He estimated that nothing
.would be heard for at least three
weeks.

Face Discrimination Issue
  A   A Local IF Representatives

View National Frat Problem

Campus fraternities had the problem of what to do about dis-
crimination in their organizations tossed into their laps by the
National Interfraternity‘Conference in Washington.

Although agitation against discriminatory fraternity member- »
ship requirements has not previously reared its head at Pitt, Uni-
versity delegates to the NIC caught a glimpse of the national

situation.
Pitt Lzepresented

Pitt delegates Ray Maher, presi-
dent of IF Council, and Dick Cun-
ningham, secretary of the IFC, to-
gether with Lester G. Brailey, ad-
viser to fraternities, witnessed the
initial attempt of NICVmembers to
rid member fraternity constitutions
of discriminatory clauses. Many
fraternities have clauses in their
constitutions that base member-
ship requirements on race or re-
ligion.

The NIC is made up of represent-
atives of the 58 national frater-
nities. .

During the two-day session the
conference killed a resolution that
would have lined it up against dis-
criminatory membership by—laws.i
It did adopt, however, a milder
resolution urging fraternities to
"take such stepsas they may elect”
to eliminate them.

Delegation Disagrees

Student delegates Maher and Cun-
ningham took an entirely different
stand on the importance of the anti-
discrimination work of the confer-
ence than did Brailey. Maher termed
it a“minor part ofthe proceedings,”
being overshadowed by deliberation
on fraternity public relations,
scholarship, cost of living, frat-
ernity houses, and Greek Week.

Cunningham told the Pitt News
that there was no strong feeling
either for or against discrimination

University
Gets Grants

The University has received two
grants totaling $220,000 from the
National Cancer Institute and the
Acid Open Hearth Association Inc.

The $200,000 grant from the In-
stitute, made recently was awarded
for the construction of facilitiesfor
use in cancer research.

The Open Hearth Association re-
news a $20,000 research program in
the metallurgical engineeringdepart-
ment. The program, in its eighth
consecutive year, deals with the re-
fining problems in the acid open
hearth method ofhandling liquidsree1_

Dr. G.R. Fitterer, head of the met-
allurgical engineering department,
is director of the program in which
eleven steel companies are cooper-
ating. Dr. J.A. Berger, associate
professor in the same department,
is an advisor.

In announicing these grants in
Washington, Dr. Leonard A. Scheele,
surgeon general 0fthePublic Health
Service said they would help meet
an urgent demand for laboratories
and equipment throughout the nation.

 
  
   
  
 

29 Greek Groups in Thursday ’s Sing

Fourteen fraternity and fifteen
sorority sing teams make up the fi-
nal entry list for Thursday night’s
IF-Pan Hel Sing scheduled to get
under way at 7:30 p.m. at the YM
and WHA auditorium.

Open to the public at no charge,
this year’s sing meet has an inter-
national flavor to it. Each contest-
ing group is required to sing one
fraternity or sorority song and in
addition one song representative
of some country. Among the coun-
tries to be represented are England,
Norway, Sweden, Russia, France,

Mexico, and Holland.

Phyllis Bowden, of Alpha Delta
Pi sorority, and Mel Silver, of Sig-
ma Alpha Mu fraternity, are co-
chairmen for the event.

Six loving cups will be awarded
as prized for the meet. Three of the
cups are for the winners of the IF
sing, and the remainingthree for
the leaders in the Pan-Hel division
of the meet. The Pan-Hel winners
will be announced following the sing,
while the IF winners will be an-
nounced the following evening at
the IF’s Winter Wonderland ‘Ball 2‘

the William Penn Ilotel.

Last year’ s winners, Kappa Kappa
Gamma for the sororities, and Phi
Delta Theta for the frats, are among
this year's entries.

Mimi McCauley, Fifkie Schulhof,
Renee Schorin, and Bob Forman
make up the remainder of the IF-
Pan Hel Sing Committee.

Judges of the contest will be Dr.
J. M. Ferguson of Pitt’s. economic
department,Ruth Haun of the speech
department, and Dr. J. Julius Baird
of the Duquesne University School
of Music.

at the conference. "It was not a
warm topic.” He said, “They’re
right back where theygstarted from.”

Brailey on the other hand said,
‘This year the NIC passed a res-
solution that recognized the pro-
blem of discrimination.” He "con-_
ference that "recognition of the
problem as one that actually exists
is in itself a step forward.”

Little Trouble Here

At Pitt the Interfraternity Council.
is well balanced in membership and
membership requirements, perhaps
partially explaining the lack of
local trouble.’ ' I

Of the 19 fraternities making up I’
the IFC, three are for men of th
Jewishfaithi, Kappa Nu, Sigma All
pha Mu, and Phi Epsilon Pi. 0
group has exclusively Negro mem
bership, Alpha Phi Alpha, while an
other, Alpha Phi Delta, takes onl
men of Italian descent. ‘There i
one fraternity exclusively for meri
of the Catholic faith, Phi Kappa.

Working between these. various‘
extremes is a non-sectarian group,
Pi Lambda Phi. A localKappaBetar
Phi, is currently seeking national
affiliation along these same lines.
One of the three Jewish frats is
contemplating changing its consti-
tution so that it also is non-sectar-
ian in character.

Stadium Bon
Debt Retired

Another milestone in the finan-
cial history of the University was
passed Dec. 1 when the last of
$2,100,000 worth of bondswere re-
tired. These bonds, which were is-
suedin1924 through the MellonNa- 0
tional Bank, were sold for the pur-
pose of financing the construction
of Pitt Stadium.

The Stadium created many per-
plexing problems when it was
opened in 1025. A fight to have the
stadium declared tax exempt Was,
finally ‘won after a dispute of sev- A
eral years.

After the University in 1034 ‘de-
clared that the stadium was losing ,0
almost $60,000 a season, it was
charged thatagroup of bankers who 1
had bought heavily in the bonds had
seized control of Pitt athletics to A
protect their investment.

Confidence in the bonds picked
up however. The value of the bonds ,
climbed to $810 each by 1945. This
was in contrast to a low in 1043 of
$370. ,

Liquidation of the Stadium bonds I
does not mean that the stadium has i
completely paid for itself. Since
only $800,000 had been retired dur- 0
ing the past 25 years, the Univer-
sity had to raise the other $1,300,000
Some of this money came from school
funds, but the bulk of it was raised
through refinancing in local banks.

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
       
  

   
      
   
  
  
      
 
  
  
   
  
  
  
    
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
    
 
    
   
  
   
   
   
    
  
   
   
  
   
    
   
   
    
   
  

 
 

y. _ . A _
Brew--mg Trouble -

The Marjorie Homan incident at the Penn State game didn’t
raise th_e stir we expected or thought it deserved. Right now the I
Awhole case seems to be rapidly becoming just so much water
over the dam. No hearing has begn set to settle the case against
‘Eugene Seiling, a College junior who is the accused thrower of
the half-gallon wine jug that struck Miss Homan and gashed the
back of her head. ‘

While Seiling was suspended from classes pending the final
disposition of the case against him; nothing official was form-
ally announced either on the suspension or in the line of a strong
reasserting of University policy against the presence of liquor,
hard and soft varieties, at school-sponsored functions. Football
games come under this category. It was doubtless the consump-
tion ofthe contents of the jug that promoted the thoughtless throw-
‘ing of it into the crowd below. I

The administration is missing an opportune moment for making
an effective and strong reiteration of theirpolicy on such matters.

Student Congress, too, at its two meetings following the ac-
cident, overlooked it. This body, presumably entrusted with the
student body's voice in campus affairs, would have been wise to
register its disapproval of such conduct under such conditions.
:With strong student backing, Congress would have been doing‘
both the students and the school a service by airing the situa-
ation. But it didn’t. I

The impression is not to be drawn from this article that the
he News is carrying on a.temperance campaign. We are not, in
" this instance, concerned with drinking as such. -
We’re:not trying to wipe it out. What we are aiming at isto
ya ter it somewhat with regard to student conduct in the Stadium.
1"There is a time and place for drinking. Heavy drinking at football
games is definitely out ofplace. Watching the game, not the level
lofthe liquid ina bottle is what we are supposed to be going to
games -for. I .

Miss Homan was not the only sufferer of damage from occu-
pants of the student section this fall. The band took abeating,
too. Tubas, damaged by the direct hits of heaved beer bottles,
will have to be repaired. Other equipment was threatened after
the games by the students who poured through the band stand on
their way to the exits from the gridiron.

Perhaps, if memories linger that long, the jug incident itself
will serve as a moderating inﬂuence at future football games. It
has been a practically unanimous opinion that the thrower of the
wine jug, Seiling or whoever is to blame, should “get the works”
for doing such an "assinine thing.”

This attitude indicates that a strong announcement from those
overseeing the student body, whether they be the school author-
S ities or the student's representatives on Congress, would have
been well-received. ,

A thumb-screw crackdown on drinking by University students
is not what we're seeking. Of course, any concrete restrictions ’
would only be as successful as the students are willing to co-
operate. The residue of beer and liquor bottles, which seem to
outnumber empty pop and coffee cups in the student sections
after the games, is certainly no compliment to the student body
or school.‘

Editor,

Seldom has an engineering stu-
dent opened his mouth concerning
anything in this University, and
never have I complained about any-
thing, not even Tuck Shop “coffee.”
But now close to graduation I would
like to know just what the policies
of the Owl staff are -- just -how did
they come to choose Delma studios
to do the portraitures for the year
book.

When I received my proofs, I
was sure that Delma thought infla-
tion was on the way. Anyone who
yvishes to buy pictures and has a
large number of relatives would
have‘ to be a millionaire, or else
have just robbed a bank. To prove
to myself that the prices were out

just what he is paying for his pic-
tures from a well known Pittsburgh
firm. The price was only $9.50 for
twelve 5”x 7" colored portrait in
a frame. The comparable price at
Delma’s was $22.50 without the
frame for the larger picture. Maybe
there is a reason for this big dif-
ference in price, if so I would like
to know it. I'm sure though that it
isn’t in the quality or volume of
the work. In fact that volume should
be to our advantage.

But then I know Pitt isn’t‘ as bad
off as some other schools. Penn
State students would have to pay

described, plus $1.50 for a sitting
fee. I wish someone would tell
these photographers that everyone
who goes to school these days
isn’t a millionaire.

ED. NOTE -- We asked the Owl
to supply the answer. It follows:

Perhaps you had better complain
about coffee because you're way off
base as far as The Owl is con-
cerned. No other activity in the
University is more concerned about
the welfare of its customers.

Only 2 of 129 Pittsburgh photo-
graphers wanted to do the Owl
photography. Of the others who
were asked if they were interested,

of line I asked a high school friend. T

$30.00 for a similar assortment as,

all wanted to charge a sitting fee

and the prices of all were above
those of Delma Studio. .
To get your picture in the Owl,
which is the big thing we worry
about, simply put a‘x’on the back
of the proof you select and send
it to New York in the free return
‘envelope. Enclose no money.Then
you can feel free to have your
picture retaken at the unknown
photographer you mention. But will
bet you don’t get as good a job.
We're sorry the Pitt News Editor
mqde us delete the other 19 points
in our argument in the interest of
brevity. It would have made a good
court case.

Editor,

Ever since I_ began my’ graduate
studies atpittthis fall, I have read
week in and week out about the 8¢
Tuck Shop coffee. The Pitt News
has been full of it, from every pos-
sible angle. But if you are going
to crusade against food cost, why
just stop at the price of coffee?

Not being used to the army-type
trays for cafetria lunches, my first
thought was of this being part of an
administrative attempt to lessen
the overhead in the Pitt cafeteria
(not Tuck Shop.) There are no
dishes to wash, and an average of
three or four dishes a tray which
the cafeteria didn’t even have to.
buy! But the prices aren’t any
cheaper.

Having graduated from Carnegie
Tech, a school of Scotch tradition,
you would think that they would
have the ultimate in high food
prices. But just check up4—all of
the food is served on individual
dishes, and COFFEE IS FIVE
CENTS—ALWAYS!

It would seem reasonable that
the Pitt Cafeteria system, by the
very nature of its serving more
people, could cut prices a little.‘
They would certainly seem to have
the edge 01 Carnegie Tech, as far
as volume business is concerned.
But if you check an average meal
at Tech, it doesn't run to the 75¢
lunches served here.

epy---

In keeping with its policy of at-
tempting to present both sides of
major issues, the, News prints the
following article submitted by Ray
Maher, senior representative to
Student Congress and president of
lnterfraternity Council. Mr. Maher’s
remarks refer to an article by Len
Baker which appeared here follow-
ing the contested Congress elec-
tion several weeks ago.

In light of the recent scurrilous
attacks upon my integrity, I have
been prompted by several of my
friends (Yes, I still have some 3 to
defend my position.

Len Baker’s last column, inde-
fensible as soundjournalistic prac-
tice, creates a picture which is
entirely misleading. In an attempt
to fill 10 column inches, and in-
cidentally analyze the "political
situation,” this aspiring young
sophomore drew on his meager ex-
perience and came up with a gem
which in my opinion was little-
more than a personal attack.

Why Baker should wish to do this
is not clearly apparent. Rumor has
it, however, that a new “indepen-

dent political party” is being form-

ed. Is it possible that this young
leader has a personal political ax _
to grind? V

Whatever the motive, I feel that
the foundation for the attack is of
the flimsiest sort. He has criti-
cized me for withholding informa-
tion concerning the unconstitution-
ally-held seats on Congress. Yet
there are many reasons why I feel
my action was justified.

The News implied that I with-
held this information because of
personal fear of failing to retain
my seat in a re-election.

In my opinion, a re-election with-
out Pharmacy school’s vote would
have resulted in an even greater
sweep for the IF Slate, sincePhar-
macy’s vote was predominantly
independent. As for personal
chances, there has been no indica-
tion that IF Council would repud-
iate its president when it came to
drawing up the IF Slate.

It must be remembered, too, that
by September the amorphous and‘.
loosely knit Independent Party had
ceased to function as an organized
body; hence, my failure to speak
should not be ascribed to fear of an
independent victory. _

If I had been motivated by purely
selfish or. political ambitions’, it
would have been politically wise
to demand a new election in the
hope of unseating the remaining
independents on Congress. It is

' my honest opinion, however, that

the independent voice in Student
Government bodies .is essential
to effective legislation. Further-
more, I did not wish to see the in-
dependent male voice abolished.
Len Baker contended that it was
my duty to reveal this information.
gained through my own initiative, ,
I was no more duty-bound to re-
lease it than I am to report facts

. available to me about the private

lives of some of the leading mem--
bers of the Student Congress.

In considering the situation, it
appears that the intent of T3aker’s
recent article was either to hurt
me personally, or, and more likely,
because of my being president of
IF Council, to reflect upon the
integrity of that body. —

Spring elections are coming up
again; perhaps this attack upon
me is the first bit of mud to be

Mistaken Identity

At the open house, one visitor
kept insisting on going out on the
observation deck atop the building.
He was repeatedly told that the
place was closed. Finally he shook
his head and asked a hostess if
this wasn't the Gulf Building.

It seems that a friend of his had
told him to be sure and go up to
the top of the Gulf Building when
he came to Pittsburgh, and he
drifted in with the crowd, thinking
he had arrived.

Well, at least no one thought the
Cathedral was Tech or Duquesne.

The idea is to make alvery literal

Following the entrance, there
will be a rundown of scores of the
season’s football games with the

fects.

Next,the band will play formation
music from the games.

The formation music is followed
on the program by a series of
matches and specialties featuring

the different sections of the organ-_

  
 
 

ization.

One of the highlights of the pro-
gram will be the presentation of
the University of Pittsburgh Sing-
ing Band. The band will sing a
group of Christmas selections.

Two Gridders
Now Matmen

A couple of football Johns loomed
large in Pitt’s varsity wrestling
picture this week.

Gridders John Coyne and John
Masarik, who joined the team at
the end of the football season, have
made a favorable» impression on
Coach Rex Peery in their early
workouts. If they progress as rap-
idly in future drills as they have
last week, the gridders may take
top, rankings‘ and represent the
Blue and Gold in the Gettysburg
meet.

Position Uncertain

Coyne, who wrestles in the 175-
pound division, haslshown enough
wrestling know-how in practice to
make the holder of the top posi-
tion in that class an uncertainity
until Thursday’s rankings.

Among the heavyweights, Mas-
arik has thrown his 190 pounds
around the mat during drills with
enough agility and cleverness to
catch Peery’s eye. _His presence
gives added stre-

ngth to Pitt’s
heavy W e i g h t
class.

In the 128-pound
class, Jim Hast-
ings has moved
up to share top
honors with Ray
Cappelli.
In Clinic

Last Saturday
the matmen took

    

John Masarik

off from their drills to participate
in a wrestling clinic held at Un-
iontown. The purpose of the clinic
was to teach high school wrestlers
fundamentals of the sport.

Pitt’s representatives at the
instructional meeting were Peery
and Grapplers Frank Skirpan and
Ed King. After demonstrations of

various takedowns, Skirpan and
King took part in exhibition
"latches.

TWO PITT STARS -Bimbo Cec-
coni and Bernie Barkouskie were
named on the Penn State all-oppon-
ent football team.

ball games with her father who was
an umpire. When the game became
exciting and the fans screamed,
"Kill the umpire.” Mrs. Howe re-
members yelling, "No you won’t.”
Meets Other Fans

On the way to classes, Mrs.
Howe often meets Miss Emily Ir-
vine and Dr. Dorothy I"/l.ll.lCl'o

Miss Irvine, who's father was an
ex-Princeton end and later a grid
coach, views her football from a
practical standpoint.

“I was taught early,’ she says,
"that a wise spectator does not
follow the ball carrier all the time,
but pays attention to guards and
tackles.”

Another’s Father

In the football department, Dr.
Miller, too, has a father that was
connectedwith the game.Her father
was athletic director at Pitt before
the first world war, and she has
always liked the game.

A Dr. Miller is also fond of tennis.
She has played amateur tennis and
was once ranked No. 4 in women's
singles in Western Pennsylvania.

Switchingto themale sex, there’s
Dr. Putman Jones, head of the Eng-
lish department,who played sandlot
and college baseball, and Dr. Don-
ald Lee, an ex-high school football
player.

Giant Fan

While living in New York, Dr.
Lee became a Giant fan, and there-
fore has little love for the Dodgers.
At home, he has a tiger-colored cat
named Ralph Kiner.

Dr. Lee says,"I namedhim Ralph
Kine: because of his slowness
afoot. When the cat moves, it re-
minds me of the way Kiner ambles
and lopes after a fly ball.”

Another avid baseball fan is Dr.
Ford Curtis. He sees around 25 to
30 gamesa year at Forbes Field
and makes it a habit to see other
major league games when he is

Milton, the English faculty is "hep” to its sports. ‘

Getting back to football, Dr.
Lawrence Lee (not Donald)‘played
end on his high school team and
compares the grid sport with the
ballet.

American Ballet

He says, “Americans think the
European ballet is boring. So they
have invented alballet of their own
with objective and precision--this
is football.”

Another member of the English
department who likes football, but
on a somewhat different basis, is
Maurice Weil. He thinks that col-
lege sports should be on an ama-
teur basis with no gate receipts.

Switch Crowd

Tankers Deep

In Practice

Even though the first dual meet
is way off in January, Coach Ben
Grady has had his swimming team
getting into shape since the first
week in October.

"It takes a long time to. prepare
a swimming team for a strenuous
season,” Grady explained. Per-
haps this reason more than any-
thing else, will explain why Pitt
has had one of the best swimming
teams in the East.

Nucleus Back

Grady will welcome back the
nucleus of last year's fine squad.
Having lost only one dual meet in
a 13-meet schedule, and that by the
slim margin of 38-37 to Penn State,
the Pitt.tankers will be out to dup-
licate their 1947-48 record of a per-
fect season.

The swimming Panthers lost only
three men through graduation. Walt
Jackson, freestyler, Bill Manko,
backstroker, and diver Howard Sad-
owsky were lost via the sheepskin
trail.

Petro Again

Foremost of the holdovers is
Dick Petro. The ace freestyler, who
was voted the mostvaluable member
of the team by an_Qwl-conducted
ballot of the tankers, is only an
advanced junior. _

Also returning is the Eastern
Collegiate Swimming Association
diving champ, Al Ciocca.

Grady will be able to get a pie-
view of some of his boys on Dec-
ember 17, when the annual AAU meet
is run offgat the YMHA.

Pitt's future field house, to be

Irving Berlin who composed "The

Moreover, there would be no
"professional” or "commercial”
tinge to a grappling contest in the
Hall. The spectators would be
almost solely students in on their
activity cards. And, of course, col-
legiate wrestling is not trumped
up like the pro brand.

Now if Fletcher Hodges, head

Delta Sigs
Win Easily

Delta Sigma Delta gained its
first victory of the season Thurs-
day by thumping the Pharmacy
Sophomores, 32-13.

Big Tom Cressleyled the victors
to their first triumph by scoring 15
of the Delta Sigs’ points, two more
than the losers’ total score. In
leading his team's scoring Cressley
dropped in five buckets and made
good five of his seven attempts
from the foul line.

Delta Sig ran into difficulty in
the first quarter when the Pharmacy
second-year men had them, 6-2.
However, they managed to go ahead,
8-6, before the period ended. Once
the victors did capture the lead
they never relinquished it.

In the second quarter Cressley
pulled his team way out in front
by adding six points to the margin
and by exhibiting some excellent
rebound recoveries.

The second half found Delta
Sig steadily widening its margin
while the Pharmacy Sophomores
were frantically searching for a
scoring combination.

year's team. Lou Cecconi, a regu-
lar for two seasons, will not be
out for the team until after his
appearance in the North-South grid
game over the holidays.

Cecconi was granted a "leave
of absence” by Carlson until the
first of the year, although he may
get in some practice before he
leaves for the Miami training site.

Pitt plays its first game of a
slim 17-game card at Connecticut
on Dec. 22, but local fans have to
wait until Jan. 5 to get a glimpse
of Carlson's cagers, when West.-
minster comes to the Stadium.

slogan Heard Less

Carlson knows his team is in a
bad way, and makes no pretense
of putting up a front. In fact, he
hasn't been heard expounding his
annual slogan, "win ’em all.”

Two footballers, Ted Geremsky
and George Radosevich,who turned
out for practice after football closed,
may help Carlson's undersized and
undermanned cagers. At least they
will add the needed height.

Getemsky, tallest man at 6 foot
4 inches, is a two-year squad mem-
ber, while Radosevich (6-3) is tak-
ing his first crack at the collegiate
hoop sport. Radosevich is conceded
a good chance to make the team,
having starred in intramural play
for two years.

Sets Probe 0
Of Guilds

WSGA executive committee last
week announced its intention of
investigating the guild system to
seek possible improvements in the
existing procedure.

The committee, after an open
discussion of the problem in Com-
mission, elected a sub-committee
of five to_‘look into the matter and
report back to Commission some-
time next month.

Under the head of Gretchen Phil-
lips, Guild Chairman for this year,
the committee will first investigate
the present systems and time ‘of
appointing guild advisors within
the various campus organizations.

Theoretically guild advisors for
the freshmen women’s guild period
areto be chosen by WSGA upon the
recommendation of the parent organ-
ization. WSGA would like to see the
process speeded up. -

By conferring with officers of
organizations represented
in the guild program, the investi-
gating committee intends to set
up a better method for selecting
all guild advisors.

This method will be elastic enough
to include guilds that fall under
parent organizations like Pitt Sing-
ers guild and guilds that have no
parent organization _

Since this year’s guild period
opens next week, the decisions of
this committee will be acted upon
in planning next year’s program.

Alsop Warns of Danger
In.US Policy Toward Asia

If the U.S. policy toward Asia doesn't become more serious,
Asia will be lost to the Communists.

This was the warning given to the Foreign Policy Association
of Pitt at its last meeting by Stewart Alsop, nationally known

the Far East.

In his talk on "What's next in
Asia,” Alsop added that the at-
titude towards Asia, and especially
China, has always been that of
"papa knows best.” Instead of
treating the Asiatic countries as
important nations, they have been
exploited for all they were worth.

If the U.S. would insert its in-
fluence in diplomatic activities in
Asia, the Communists could be
checked. _They have gained their
power throughout Asia by several
reasons, two of them being: the
rise of nationalism due to react-
ions against the old colonial rule,
and the prevalance of hunger, which
will turn people toward any system
that promises relief, Alsop’ said.

He concluded by saying that
the U.S. should bring its econo-
mic power to bear on China, or
the Communists will over run
Asia. The Chinese Communist
leaders must be given a choice
between political and economic
interests - they must decide be-
tween Russian alliance and Amer-

ican dollars.
Xmas Panther

To Add Gravity

The Pitt Panther’s Dec. lziissue
will be in keeping with the Christ-
mas season. The mak’eup recipe
calls for the customary "humor”
and a new ingredient, gravity. It
will be liberally sprinkled with car-
toons and photographs.

Beside the traditional “humor,”
Don Horowitz, publicity director,
said the Christmas issue will intro-
duce a new feature, aserious story.
Eightofthe Panther’s 32 Pages will
be devoted tophotos and caricatures.
Two other firsts, a four color cover
and two tone front pages, will spot-
light this issue.

With these innovations, the Pan-
ther staff hopes to top its last edi-
tion sales of 3000 copies.

Coeds Ta he
Up Knitting

The twelfth floor becomes an in-
struction center beginning this week
as the WSGA 12th floor committee
opens the floor to knitting, bridge
and canasta lessons.

Under the committee ’s new plan
men and women are allowed to come
to room 1228 to play cards and ping
pong or get instruction. The mem-
bers of the committee will be on the
floor every day from 1:30 to 5:30
p.m. to supply students with any
materials they need.

The weekly schedule for the rest
of the semester is as follows:

Mon. 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. bridge and
knitting lessons; Tues. 1:30 to 2:30
p.m. bridge, 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. knit-
ting; Wed. 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. knitting;
Thurs. 2:30 to 3:30'canasta; and Fri.
1:30 to 2:30 p.m. canasta.

Mina Serbin, committee chairman,
also announced that a ping pong
tournament can be arranged if enough
people are interested in the plan.

icine Foundation.

This work will be carried out by
Dr. Salk and Dr. Julius S. Younger,
recently of the National Cancer
Institute.

Facilities are also being readied
for the diagnosis and control of
rabies and other virus diseases.
The results of this service will be
made available to local physicians
and hospitals. Miss Alfhild John-
son is an associate in this project
through thecooperation ofthe Pitts-
burgh Public Health Laboratory.

The virus research laboratory
was established in October, 1947,
with the cooperation of the Pitts-
burgn Health Department and by the
aid of a grant from the University
and the Sarah Mellon Scaife Found-
ation. It is located in the Munici-
pal Hospital and is one of the
finest in existence.

Last January, the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
selected Dr. Salk to direct polio-
myelitis research here through a
grant of $148,975. Continued sup-
port of the same magnitude has
been assured for the next several
years, Dr. Salk said.

The purpose of the research
being done here is to contribute
knowledge for the eventual con-
trol of the crippling disease. "The
determination of the number of
types of virus is part of the master
plan directed toward this object-
ive,” Dr. Salk stated. It has already
been demonstrated that three dif-
ferent types of poliomyelitis virus
exist. '

"Daisy Macs" of the Sophomore
Class will hold an old time Hill-

of the twelfth floor tomorrow at 12:30.

This gathering of the clan will
honor Sophomore transfers to Pitt.
Sophomore co-eds are asked to come
and give them a real welcome.

After a box-lunch which the ‘‘Hill- 

Billies for a day” will provide,
plans call for a skit, games and a
discussion of, several topics of cur-
rent importance.

Among these are: means of im-
proving class spirit, plans for the
coming Sophomore Parents’ Coun-
cil, and the race between the Soph-L
omore and Junior classes in col-
lecting their fifty cent dues.

Special attention will be given
this race, because thepsuedo—coun-

side of the feud to win the prize-a
silver loving cup. This will be a-
warded at a party given for all co-
eds who have paid their dues.
