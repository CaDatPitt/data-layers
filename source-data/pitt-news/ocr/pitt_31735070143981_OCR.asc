Plagiarism and Pitt

University has no blanket policy

by Keith Gillogly
Staﬂ Wrdcr

Borrowing a sentence or two
from the Internet for that midterm
paper that’s due in 20 minutes can
be tempting, but Pitt takes plagia-
rismlseiiously. 0

Using material from another
source or failing to properly cite
such material is considered plagia-
rism. Once a student has been sus-

' pected of plagiarizing, the student’s

instructor then notiﬁes both the
student and the 'dean’s office of the

offense.

Should the student plead 

. the instructor is free to decide the

punishment

“There’s no standardized set
of penalties here,” said Frederick
 assistant dean of under-
graduate studies for Arts and Sci-
ences. “Individual faculty members
can decide what penalty they think
is appropriate.” ' ‘

Whelan, who is also a professor
at Pitt, added that some professors
will give the student a zero for just

the assignment, while others won’t
hesitate to fail the student for the
course. , ‘

The severity of -the penalty often
depends on the extent of incrimi-
 material. A single plagiarized
sentence or citation error may be
‘treated more lightly than  entire
copied paper, he said.

Students generally plead 
upon an accusation, he said. How-
ever, if a student wants'_to appeal,
the department chairperson hears
the case If a student is still unsatis-

'Hakuna matata,' says speaker

by Michael Ploetz
For T £15 Pitt New

Last night, Imam Zaid Shakir
came to Pitt to address both Muslim
and non-Muslim students on their
role in today’s world.

“Peace. Shalom. Hakuna mata-
ta,” Shakir said at the beginning of
his address.

The audience responded with
laughs.

“Hey, you gotta touch every
faith,” he said back.

The event, hosted by the Muslim
Students Association in David Law-
rence Hall, was originally intended
to highlight the responsibilities of
American youth in modern society,
although Shakir mentioned various
related points.

“Youth are a source of new vision,”
said Shakir.

An American Muslim with de-
grees from Rutgers University and
American University, Shakir’s travels

have taken him as far as Egypt, ‘Syria '

and Morocco. He currently lives in
Hayward, Calif. and lectures at Zay—
tuna Institute.

He fu.rther said that young people

don’t share" the same concerns as
their elders. Normally, they don’t
own houses or expensive cars nor

do they have prestigious, lucrative’

careers.

“They have relatively little to
lose,” he said, which explains why
college students and other young
Americans are most frequently the
ones “holding signs and protesting
and potentially going to 

Shakir went on to apply this
logic to the current presidential
election. He said that by portraying
themselves as outsiders, Sen. Ba-
rack Obama and Sen. john McCain,

_along with Gov: Sarah Palin, can

validate bringing new ideas to the
White House.

“Most innovations  by
one of two types‘ of ‘people: youth-
ful people or people who are new to
their particular ﬁeld.”

While this may not apply’ equally ’

to both presidential candidates, it ex-
plains why Obama and McCain are
trying so hard to represent change,
he said. ' i

Shakir also emphasized the un-
predictability of American morality,

individual who challenged Obama’s
tax hikes for people making more
than $250,000 per year.

“What’s happening to us as a
society when it becomes un—Amer-
ican to share?” said Shakir of those
against having their taxes raised.

“We have, either through com-
plicity or negligence, contributed to
the situations we see in the world to-
day,” said Shakir. ‘The young people
have to address these situations.”

2 According to Shakir, the best
way to create charlge is to be an ex-
emplar for the people. After assur-
ing the audience that he understands
how challenging todayfs times are, he
furthered his pointtby reading from
a letter that Abigail Adams wrote to
her son and future president, John
Quincy ‘Adams, when he was 12
yearsold.

“These are times in which a ge-
nius would wish to live,” the letter
said. “It is not in the still calm of

life or the repose of a paciﬁc station

that great characters are formed.”

Afterfolding up his copy of the
letter, Shakir ﬁnished with a single
statement: “Never wish you lived in
another time.” ‘

the document’s authenticity. The
site looksfor patterns in the stu-
dents’ work and compares them
to existing documents in Turni-
tin.com’s databases.

The site, according to its in-
formation page, also checks the

document against “thousands of ,

other sources likely to be used for
plagiarism, such as: books, en-
cyclopedias, subscription—based
publications, newspapers and pe-
riodicals.”

The site provides teachers with
printable reports and side—by-side
comparisons with excerpts that
appear to have been plagiarized.

The site says it has reduced
plagiarism by 82 percent since its
inception.

But this doesn’t mean that the
Web site isn’t controversial.

In March, two students from
McLean High School, in Fairfax
Va., ﬁled a lawsuit in  District
Court in Alexandria accusing the
Web site of violating copyright

law by holding their documents,
according to the Washington Post.
U.S. District Court Judge Claude
Hilton dismissed the charges,
saying Turnitincom “provides a

- substantial public beneﬁt through

the network of educational insti-
tutions.”

Turnitin.com charges each
instructor or establishment that
uses its services. To receive a
price estimate, users must enter
information including the type of
institution, total student enroll-
ment and location.

The Essay Veriﬁcation En-
gine, also known as EVE2, also
checks stlidents’ assignments for
plagiarism, but costs less.

The Essay Veriﬁcation System,
which costs $29.99, compares the
submitted work with Web sites. It

Forgotten War

I Violence on the rise in Afghanistan, ;

but 710 one seems I0 I’l0tiC€

In southern Afghar1istan’s
Kandahar province on Sunday,
Taliban insurgents stopped a bus,
pulled out about 50 passengers
and beheaded up to 30 of them.
Many of the passengers were
women and children.

The attack was the latest sign
of the Taliban’s growing inﬂu-
ence in Afghanistan. In the region
that generated the Sept. 11, 2001
attacks against the United States,
militant Islamists are regaining
control and working with a broad-
er insurgency, making the threat
of another attack a much greater
possibility.

Violence in the war—torn coun-
try has reached its highest levels
since the United States invasion
in late-2001. Last month, Fran-
cesc Vendrell, a European envoy
to Afghanistan, said, according
to The New York Times, that
conditions in the country are at
their worst this year. The increas-
ing number of civilian casualties
caused by U.S. and international
forces has also created “a great
deal of antipathy” among the Af-
ghan people. .

An Aug. 22'U.S. airstrike on the
village of Azizabad, for example,
killed 33 civilians, according to U.S.
military officials. In September,
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M.
Gates expressed his “personal re-
grets” for the deaths of civilians,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. But the loss of innocent
life has hurt the United States’ al-
ready deteriorated image.

Last week, the Times reported,
Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated
that Afghanistan is experiencing
a “downward spir .” And yet,
based on the Bush administra-

tion’s current lack of action and i

the news media’s sparse coverage,
no one seems to be noticing.
Amid news exposure of Iraq’s
growing success, its declining
death rate and strengthened gov-
ernment, Afghanistan has been

left on the back burner. An article ’
in the latest issue of the American .
Journalism Review analyzing the 
news media’s coverage of the war 3
in Afghanistan stated that Iraq has '

largely overshadowed Afghanistan
in the news. Unfortunately, Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom has be-

come the United States’ forgotten .

war.
The article cited a study by

Project for Excellence in]ournal— 
ism, which revealed that “stories 1

on Afghanistan accounted for 0.9
percent of the overall news hole
in 2007, a year when bombings
were increasing sharply and a re-
cord number of U.S. and coalition
troops were killed.”

Furthermore,

Vendrell’s comments appeared on
Page 11 of the Sept. 15 edition of
the Times, and a Sept. 3 follow-up

was on Page 10 of the Times.
The American public reﬂects
a similar level of apathy with

regard to Afghanistan. Accord— -

ing to Google Trends, the term
“Iraq” was searched more often

than “Afghanistan” from 2004 to 3

2008.

cans’ apparent disregard for Af-
ghanistan has much to do with
the way the Bush administration
has dealt with the conﬂict. The
sense of urgency with regard to
Afghanistan has been lost. Since
the invasion of Iraq in March
2003, the United States focused
most of its efforts, energy and as-
sets on Iraq, making a future vic-

tory in Afghanistan seem close to ‘

impossible.
\X/ith only a few months left

until the end of his presidency, it
’ it’s time for President George W

Bush to address the chaotic and
gruesome realities in Afghanistan
before it’s too late.

Dear Annie 

Relationships can suck — I believe that to be a universal truth. But it doesn’t mean they
aren’t worth it. Recently I had a conversation with a friend and was surprised to find that he
agreed with me that love is not enough. It’s not often that two people can agree on something
that is the complete opposite of what the majority of people believe. We also came to the con-
clusion that life and relationships would be easy if love were enough. '

I think we can all agree that ‘The World is Not Enough” — Pierce Brosnan taught us
that — but not many people can agree that love, the catch-all and cure—all for our lives, is not
enough.

“Enough of what?” any critical reader may ask. Enough of anything, my dear friend. It is
not enough of  V

My God! Not enough? Love, the only  needed for a happily ever after to rival Cinder-
ella’s, isn’t enough? Love, the four-letter word printed on so many stamps and scribbled next to
hearts in little girls’ notebooks, the symbol that all can have a someone to call their own, a reason
for hope, restless nights, poems, songs, the cause of so much drama and sotmany Feb. 14 wed-
dings, the light at the end of the tunnel, the reason people cry without restraint is not enough?

Love is great, don’t get me wrong There is nothing better than feeling an all-consuming
passion under a starry sky on a dark, hot night, but that feeling won’t help you when you’re
cohabitating with your signiﬁcant other of three years and he keeps leaving the milk out on the
counter and never rinses his dishes and thinks that folding clothes is too time consuming.

Patience, as in all relationships, is pivotal, perhaps more than pivotal —— super-duper neces-
sary, if you will.

Something that goes along with patience, something that most women are awful at, is treat-
ing each situation as though it were something new. I

That one time when that one girl sent him that one text message at 3 a.m. is not a valid
reason not to trust some other text from some other  at 3 p.m. about an exam. All situations
are distinct.

Trust, unequivocal trust. Understanding. Honest. Caring. Lust — yes, even lust — is nec-

The Pitt News 0 wvvw.pittnews.com 7

In relationships, you've got to, give it all

essary to carry on a stable healthy relationship. If you don’t want to randomly passionately
kiss your lover and see where the spontaneous romance takes you, then you may be in some
trouble.

Relationships die when they become stagnant, and some people just get bored with each
other after a while.

Really, it’s no one’s fault, but love is simply not enough.” Interest, passion, fun —— so much
more than love is needed.

Love is integral, don’t think that I would ever belittle love, but love is simply not all it’s rep-
resented to be. ‘

What would have happened if Cinderella had found Prince Charming to be a smoker and
was repulsed by him?

What if Sleeping Beauty had some funky morning breath and the prince couldn’t get her to
use some Listeiine?

What would have happened if the, Beast had eaten Belle when she talked back to him?

Compromise is another key. You don’t get to your 25th wedding anniversary without a little
give and take.

Relationships are hard work. They are a lot more work than most people realize. Being in a
relationship for two years, one month and three days, through moving away and the transition
into college and all the ups and down you can imagine, the only advice I can offer anyone is that
if you’re  to give it all, then you can get everything you ever hoped for. All the" Cinderella
stuff: the carriage, the beautiful dress, the Prince. And for the Prince, you can have the beautiful
girl of your dreams, be everything she ever needed and always have someone to make you feel
better after a hard day. ,

Relationships are great fun, but love is not all you need to make them work.

You have to give it all to get it all.

Tuvan's two-tone
Chirgilchin collective opens mouths, releases otherwordly sound

If you think harmonizing with others
is hard enough, try harmonizing with
yourself. Sound impossible? For Tuvan
throat singers, it’s a skill they’ve worked
hard to develop. And for Chirgilchin, a
world—renowned group from Tuva, it’s
something its members have mastered.

“It’s a style,”
said manager Bapa.

Tuvan throat singing consists of two
sounds made at once.

By constricting their windpipes in a
particular way, the singers are able to

phenomenal
Alexander

produce a low, guttural sound and a
high, shrill sound at the same time. Ac-
cording to the Chirgilchin’s MySpace
site, “It must be heard to be believed.
The music, produced by resonating low
sounds in the throat, creates a middle
note and a haunting, flute—like harmon-
ic.”

There are six main styles, and though
none of them are easy, the members
of Chirgilchin have mastered them all.

Chirgilchin uses several traditional in-
struments while performing. The igil is
a two—stringed, wooden, lute-like instru-
ment. The doshpuluur is a wooden, Tu-
van lute that traditionally has two strings,
but now has up to four. The byzaanchy
is a four-stringed instrument, but unlike
the normal playing strategy of playing
the bow on the outside of the strings,
the bow is actually on the inside.

All of these instruments take great
skill to play, but if you’re determined,
Chirgilchin sells them on their official
Web site, chirgilchin.com.

This method of singing was done
first by herders, so it makes sense that
the sounds are intended to mimic noises
in nature like gurgling waters and Whis-
tling winds. The overall effect is one
that many people find mesmerizing and
soothing.

Chirgilchin, a group of Tuvan throat singers, will play at Belleﬁeld Hall this Saturday. Doesn't get much more authentic than this.

Throat singing reaches beyond Tuva,
a small, autonomous republic of Rus-
sia located in Siberia. Several other
places, including Tuva’s neighbor Mon-
golia, have different styles of the art.
But Bapa says of Tuvan throat singers,
particularly Chirgilchin, that “They’ve

country in Europe.

The group is comprised of four
members, three men and one woman,
notable because men have historically
been the primary Tuvan throat singing
due to a taboo against women singers.

The female vocalist is Aidysmaa Ko-

shkendey. The male vo-

bors. It’s a more clear
sound that comes

then they have com-
peted every other year
and performed almost everywhere. It’s a
pretty big deal for a group under an in-
die label to boast that it’s sung in every

hot weather, you can

see air dancing on the

road, like a mirage on the road. This is
Chirgilchin. It’s air dancing.”

And the songs they are performing

are not contemporary.

“It’s Very old, like a thousand years,
maybe more,” said Bapa, “Nobody
knows who the composer is —— they’re
folk songs.”

Just because Chirgilchin isn’t writing
cutting edge music does not mean that it
hasn’t branched out in other ways. The
group has worked with performance
artist Laurie Anderson, as well as mas-
ter didgeridoo player, Stephen Kent.

“Sometimes big stars want to try to
make music with us,” said Bapa.

If all this sounds like something
you would actually like to try, you’re in
luck — Chirgilchin offers workshops
for those interested in learning Tuvan
throat singing. It teaches a camp each
summer in Tuva, and it works in the
United States, as well.

Bapa explained that “many people
are interested to try all these styles and
we usually do workshops for them.”

  Caliendo's impressions

more than impressive

by Donald Campbell
Staﬂ Writer‘

"Frank TV" Season. Two

  

Executive Producer: Frank
Caliendo

Frank Caliendo longs for a world where
politicians can say whatever theyfd like without
the press ever  note. And he’s created it in
“Frank TV” — the TBS show with an extend-
ed cast capable of cbnvincingly impersonating
Sen. Barack Obarna and Sen. Hillary Clinton,
amongothers. D p ,

If _ anyone missed the ﬁrst season, “Frank
TV” is a showcase for the impersonation talents
of Caliendo —- as seen on ‘Mad TV.” Cali-

endo’s impersonations of Donald Trump and _

President George W Bush are extremely well
done His political commentaries are hilarious
When impersonating Bush, Caliendo loads his
speech with the normal Bushisms,-making up
words and adding.“—inate ” at the end of real
words — F i‘

Caliendo’s impersonation of Sen. John Mc-
Cain accentuates the senator’s_ stereotypically
stodgy, set—in—his-ways, old man image in con-
trast to his impersonation of Obama, whom he
portrays as bored and disdainful.

“Frank TV” in addition to Caliendo, in-
cludes a nicely varied castof other imperson-
ators, namely Freddy Lockhart and Mike Mac-

Rae. All three are able to do convincing Tom
Brokaws, when required. Lockhart can do an
excellent Obarna and isn’t half bad at imper-
sonating Samuel L. Jackson.

Caliendo’s show manages to" be hilarious
without falling into the trap that many imper-
sonations do. Caliendo doesn’t make his jokes

stupid, nor does he merely impersonate the-

strange quirks of his characters —— he man-

ages to capture their true nature After watch-

ing “Frank TV,” one gets the impression that
if Brokaw or‘ Obama were to watch his show,
they would legitimately ﬁnd his impersonations
funny — rather than insulting.

Another excellent quality of “Frank. TV”
isits universal ridicule. Caliendo is more than
likely a liberal -— as many people in show busi-

. ness are. This doesnot stop him ﬁom exploit-

ing the idiosyncrasies of Obama, Al Gore and
many other liberal policymakers His major criti-
cisms of Bush relate to the ipresident’_s propen-
sity to insert his foot in his mouth, ratherthan
his policies. . .

For those interested in the upcoming elec-
tion, “Frank TV” will be- happy to lend a hand
in helping you get a handle on the situation. The
show plans on a special election night
show, complete with Dick Cheney and Bush.
The two will do their best to lend’ their wisdom

from eight years of presidency to help choose a .

successor
Despite thepreviously stated praise for
“Frank TV” it seems like it may not last as long

as one might expect. Although impressions are

 ‘ hilarious and Caliendo does an excellent job in
‘delivering them, one can only listen to a spoof

of Gore for so long before becoming bored. Al-
though the second season of “Frank$TV” will
more than likely provide much entertainment,
season three, if it occurs, might be signiﬁcantly
less fantastic.

Also, it has yet to be seen how “Frank TV”
will respond to the decision of the upcoming
presidential election. It can be reasonably pre-
dicted that Caliendo can go one of two ways:
He can continue his broad spectrum of ridicule,
resulting in a well—done show, or he can focus
on the presidential winner and beat the subject
to death. The latter decision would not be nearly
as impressive, nor as entertaining.

“Frank TV” will air Oct; 21. The first epi-

sode of the second season will begin at 11 p.m.

on TBS.

Saturday’s game against Navy
marked the first time Pitt traveled
to Annapolis, Md., since 1987, thus
making it the first time any of the
Pitt players got to experience all of
Navy’s pre—game ceremonies.

Big East

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬁ’ Wrtter

Big East football didn’t grab
the national spotlight this past

_ weekend like it did two weekends

ago, but one surprising upset and
two other major blowouts have
separated the potential powers-
to-be.

The ﬁrst split began with Pitt’s
trouncing of Navy on Saturday.
The Panthers (5-1, 2-0) piled up
499 yards of offense, the 500-
mark ruined late in the game on a
kneel down, to crush an inspired
Navy squad on its homecoming.

-. Meanwhile, in other action on

Saturday, South Florida bounced
back after its disappointing loss
two weeks ago to Pitt and blew
out Syracuse, 45-13.

Quarterback Matt Grothe
had 248 yards and three touch-
downs through the air and added
72 yards and a touchdown on
the ground for the Bulls. Taurus
Johnson caught three passes for
two touchdowns and 29 yards.

- The Bulls now sit in fourth place

in the Big East after their ﬁrst
conference win.

On the other side of the ball,
there were not many positive

17. Pitt (5-1)

things to take out of the Orange’s
dismal performance in Tampa.
But senior Curtis Brinkley scored
once and broke the century mark
for the fourth straight game,
amassing 112 yards on the ground
on 20 carries.

The upset of the week came
courtesy of Rutgers.

The Scarlet Knights escaped
with a 12-10 victory over the sud-
denly fading Connecticut Hus-
kies.

Kordell Young ran for 80
yards and a touchdown on 28 car-
ries to pace the Scarlet Knights
backﬁeld.

The Huskies’ Zach Frazer
threw for 236 yards and one
touchdown, but the game came
down to special teams.

Connecticut kicker Tony Cia-

ravino missed three kicks, includ-
ing a 42-yarder that hit the right
upright with 1:09 remaining,
to hamper the Huskies scoring
hopes. .
Finally, Louisville won its sec-
ond straight game in convincing
fashion with a 42-23 victory over
Middle Tennessee State on Satur-
day.

The Cardinals’ tailback Brock
Bolen ran for three touchdowns

and 67 yards. Bolen’s backﬁeld
partner, freshman Victor An-
derson, ran for 161 yards and a
touchdown to help the Cardi-
nals overcome early ineffective-
ness from quarterback Hunter
Cantwell.

Cantwell threw two ﬁrst-quar-
ter interceptions, leading to 14
points for the Blue Raiders. But
Louisville used the ground game
and a blocked punt to secure the
victory.

To summarize, South Florida
and Pitt continued to establish
themselves as perennial confer-
ence powers for the rest of the
season. West Virginia didn’t play
over the weekend but will face
Auburn Thursday night in a game
that could propel the Mountain-
eers back into the national spot-
light. '

Big East Beast of the Week

Offense

The Pitt fan’s heart might say
McCoy, but the head should pick
Grothe. The South Florida quar-
terback did it all for the Bulls,
leading the team in passing and
rushing while nursing a little case
of the “sleepies” before the game.

Pitt’swh1tvmweeksagoinTampa,l*1aGmd1eam1ﬂ1eBuHsammnkedNu l7inﬂ1eBCSandAPpdls.

According to ESPN.com, Grothe
said he was more worried about
getting up at 7 a.m. for the noon
kickoff time than the game itself.

Defense

This one goes to the Pitt de-
fensive line. The job that unit did
in shutting down the patented
Navy fullback dive was nothing
short of dominant and forced
Navy to rely on outside runs.

Rutgers’ Blair Bines should
also get some recognition for
tackling Connecticut tailback
Donald Brown in the endzone for
a safety and eventually the game-
winning score.

Big East Least of the Week

Connecticut kicker Ciaravino
was wide left on a 43-yard at-
tempt, hit the right upright on a
25-yarder and was wide left on a
42-yard try with just more than a
minute left. The Huskies ended
up losing by just two points after
kicker Tony Ciaravino missed a
ﬁeld goal. There must have been
some serious wind issues in Pis-
Caraway, N.]., this weekend.

Big East Game of the Week
Connecticut vs. Rutgers.

Big East “On a Leash” this
Week

Maybe not on a leash, more
like a lame duck. Especially now
heading into a bye week, the tick-
ing clock on Greg Robinson’s
tenure at Syracuse begins to tick
just that much louder after an em-
barrassing home loss dropped the
Orange to 2-22 against Big East
opponents under Robinson.

Big East’s Best Matchup of
Next Week

Plenty of Big East matchups
ﬁll next week with Rutgers visit-
ing Pitt, Connecticut hosting Cin-
cinnati and South Florida travel-
ing to Louisville. But the only
out-of—conference tilt kicks off in
Morgantown Thursday night as
the one—time SEC power Auburn
Tigers pay a’ visit to West Vir-
ginia. This was a good preseason
matchup when both teams were
ranked in the top 15. But both
teams have been struggling, and
the matchup could be a big one
for either team.

Women's soccer

Win over Georgetown
keeps Pitt women alive

by Jasmine Hawkins
Staﬁ’ Writer

Ashley Habbel’s goal with four
seconds remaining pushed the Pitt
women’s soccer team past George-
town (10-3-2) for a doub1e—over—
time win Sunday on senior day.

\With the 2-1 victory over the
Hoyas, the Panthers (6-10-1)
earned three much—needed Big
East points and tied South Florida
for ﬁfth place in the conference.

“I think we played really well to-
day,” said Pitt coach Sue-Moy Chin.
“\We are getting better at creating
chances and getting shots of .”

The ﬁrst score for the Panthers
came in the 30th minute when Jen-
nifer Kritch gained cont:rol of a
ball headed by a Georgetown de-
fender.

The goal was the 13th of the
season for Kritch, who was hon-
ored along with Kylie Veverka for
senior recognition day.

Pitt played aggressive from start

to ﬁnish, outshooting the Hoyas
14-5.

After dominating the ﬁrst
half, the Panthers were conﬁdent
in their ability to defeat No. 19
Georgetown.

“We were conﬁdent,” said Hab-
bel. “We felt like we were control-
ling the game. We were going to
score.”

Georgetown went ir1to the sec-
ond half hungry for points. In the
59th minute, Nicole Smith headed
a ball from Stephanie Zare to even
the score for the Hoyas.

“They scored, and it was a
tough goal, but we didn’t let it af-
fect us,” said Habbel.

“We just controlled the ball and
found ways to score.”

Samantha Baker made the ﬁnal
attempt at a goal for the Hoyas in
the 66th minute. Georgetown was
outshot 10-0 through the last 20
minutes of regular play and both
overtimes.

Angela derson / Staff tographer

Pitt sophomore Christina Nicassio ﬁghts for the ball Sunday in a win against Georgetown. With the win,
Pitt moved into a tie for fifth place with South Florida.

And heading into overtime, the
Panthers knew what to expect.

“Going into overtime tied 1-1,
we knew we could win, and we
needed the extra time to score,”
said sophomore Kat Weiler.

The Panthers took numerous
shots on goal, but the winning goal
came with four seconds remaining
in the second overtime.

“[The clock] was counting down

from 10 seconds, and the ball was
at the top. I could hear the count
in my head, and all I thought was,
‘Get the shot off,”’ said Habbel.

To her satisfaction, the shot
found the back of the net, and the
Panthers defeated the Hoyas, 2-1.

“In the second overtime, with
four seconds left, they never
stopped believing,” said Chin.

The Panthers see the win as evi-

<"‘1‘L

dence of their improvement

“I deﬁnitely feel like we’ve been
dominating teams all year, but we
just couldn’t get the results we
wanted. Now we’re stepping it up
offensively and playing the whole
game to the fullest,” said W/eiler.

The Panthers play Big East op-
ponent South Florida Friday in a
match that can secure a spot in the
Big East tournament.

The Littman Test

October 21, 2008

A Pacman Jones movie?

 

hi t could be eic

02 <

Tom Fox /' Dallas Morning News / MCT

Dallas Cowboy's corner Pacman Jones has had numerous run-ins with the law since his

arrival in the NFL.

by Adam Littman
Senior Stzzﬁ’ Writer

Perhaps you’ve seen ads for Oliver Stone’s
new film, “W,” which is based on the life of
President George W Bush.

It seems odd to me that he couldn’t wait until
the end of Bush’s presidency to make the movie.
It involves Bush’s life until just about the end of
his first term as president, but if Stone would’ve
waited a few more months, he could’ve had the
movie go through the entire presidency. V

Or he could’ve just attempted to predict the
future and make stuff up.

Because of this ﬁlm, I started  about
what athletes are worthy of a biopic before they

retire. So now, my ﬁiends, I bring you my idea
for a movie about Adam “Pacman”]ones.

We open in a strip club, naked ladies sur-
rounding Pacrnan and his entourage He’s inter-
mittently   of champagne and mak-
ing it rain. It’s February of 2007, and Pacman is
in Las Vegas for the NBA’s All-Star Weekend.

The only  oumumbering exposed ladies
are dollar bills, which have been ﬂying through
each shot of the scene It’s like we’re in a money
chamber that doesn’t turn off

The strippers start picking up the money,
and the club promoter starts collecting money
in a trash bag. He walks out of the club, while
on the inside, pandemonium breaks out Pac-
man is mad that people are  his money,
and his entourage starts a light. One member
of his entourage, awoman, starts ﬁghting with a
stripper, and when a security guard tries to break
it off, she breaks a champagne bottle over his
head and bites his ankle.

Meanwhile, the rest of Pacman’s entourage
has gone outside. We cut to them, yelling at the
club promoter to stop walking away, but he
doesn’t Gunshots. '

We fade out, and now Pacman is on the ﬁeld
of an empty stadium. He is tossing a football
a few yards and  and catching it. While
the ball is in the air, a ghost in a white with
‘T. Jones” written on back, chases Pacman. He
can’t outrun it. It catches him, knocking him to
the ground.

QB Bostick takes

snaps, loses redshirt

Football, page 15

team meeting on Thursday night
— that Tony broke the record,”
said Wannstedt. “But [McCoy] was
aware of that, and that was neat.”

McCoy, despite having a chest
cold, fell 24 yards short of Dorsett’s
mark with 156 yards rushing.

“It’s pretty cool, but I don’t look
into it that much,” said McCoy.
“Coach reminded me all week that
he broke the record here. But that’s
Mr. Dorsett —— a great college back.
It’s great to know that he’s from my
college, and it’s great to represent
him and Pittsburgh.”

No redshirt for Bostick

Many thought the Pitt staff
would try to redshirt sophomore
quarterback Pat Bostick this sea-
son, preserving a year of eligibility
for him while Bill Stull, a redshirt
junior, directs the offense. That
would give Bostick two years to be
the possible starting quarterback

s

   

   

after Stull graduates.

But all that was squashed, at
least for this season, when Bostick
came in late in the fourth quarter
of the game to take three snaps
that basically ran out the clock.

Under NCAA rules, any player
who has played one play during a
season, and has not suffered a sea-
son—ending injury, is ineligible for a
redshirt that season.

Wannstedt stuck by the decision
to play Bostick and burn a possible
redshirt for this year.

“We’re  to win, and he’s
our backup quarterback right now,”

said Wannstedt. “And if something ’

happens to Billy he’s got to go in
to play, and we wanted to get him
some playing time.”

When later asked whether or not
he and the staff wanted to preserve
a year of eligibility for Bostick, who
started nine games last year after
Stull was out for theuseason with an
 Warmstedt replied, “No.”

Pacman not cut out for Disney

Littman, page 17

Now we’re in NFL Commis-
sioner Roger Goodell’s ofﬁce. He’s
sitting, petting a cat with his metal
hand. He’s  down a greatest
hits list of Jones’ past run—ins with
the law". assault and vandalism charg-
es from a 2005 nightclub altercation,
marijuana possession in Fayetteville,
Ga, in 2006, disorderlyiconduct and
public intoxication in 2006 at a club
in Murfreesboro, Tenn., punching a
woman at a stiip club in 2008 and
later in 2008, getting into a fight with
his own bodyguards. I

At this point Goodell tells Jones
he is suspending the now—Cowboy
for the second half of the 2008-09
season. Jones vows to clean up his life

and swears he’ll be back next season .

Montage of Jones helping to
build houses, rescue babies stuck in
trees and reach down a kitten’s throat
to get rid of a fur ball Cut back to
Jones in the empty football stadium.
This time the ghost, in a blue jersey
with “R Jones” on the back has the
football and Jones is  it;

He reaches the ghost, dives to
tackle it, and rnid—tackle we cut to
Jones  a tackle n “opening

.v “ ‘W

mxiayma

day of the 2009-2010 NFL season
He ends up returning a punt in over-
time for the win, and everyone on the
team is really happy for him.

To celebrate Jones goes to a club,
ends up  the bar on fire and is
suspended the rest of the season, as
well as the next year. We once 
return to the empty stadium. Jones is
running away from the ghost, but this
time it catches up to him and tackles
him. We hear the noise that plays
when Pacman is caught by a ghost

Cut to the Super Bowl in 2012.
Jones and Michael Vick have led the
Kansas City Chiefs to victory over
the San Francisco 49ers. For the first
time in years, nobody is going to
Disney Land, because Disney wants
nothing to do with Jones or Vick.

Later that night Jones is out cel-
ebrating. He has a little too much to
drink and ends up stealing a giraffe,
but only so he could bring it on a
rooftop so he could steal a zeppelin
mid—ﬂight; He is then kicked out of
the NFL for good.

Nobody hears from him until
2015. It’s that year when he resurfac-

esweaiingaredbowandasstarting

quarterback for the St; Louis Ewes“-,

of the WNFL.

After  the MVP of the
league, his red bow falls off during a
press conference and everyone real-
izes it’s him. He’s then sued for sexual

harassment after spending all season’

helping his teammates put on their
chest pads before games.

We cut to Jones waking up in bed.
It’s 2005, and everything was just a
bad dream.

Just kidding. That all happens.
He ends up coaching Pop Warner
football, builds up his reputation as
a good coach and works his way up
until he’s coaching at his alrna mater:
West Virginia University.

Stone can make his movie abou’t“”‘*

Bush’s daddy issues if he wants. But
just wait until the  of this
four—hour epic

The only  that still needs to
be decided is what the better conspir-
acy theory is: Jones is a robot built in
a lab by Leonard Little in an effort to
make himself look better, or Jones is
actually a scientist working on a study
of just how much a professional ath-
lete can get away with? V
