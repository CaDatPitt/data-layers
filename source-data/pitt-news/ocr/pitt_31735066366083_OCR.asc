Volunteer Service Option

Offered July Draitees

The Selective Service System has effected ‘a
major policy changewh-ich will permit men sched-
uled for induction ‘after July 1'to enlist or be appoint-
ed in the National Guard or Reserves after receipt
of their induction orders. The regulation change also
will permit men who’ receive induction orders to

 =,,j,oin regular branches of the Armed Forces for a

minimum of two--years active dut_v. if such pro-
vtgrams are offered.-The new policy does not affect
men with June reporting dates.

The result ofdiscussions between the Depart-
ment of Defense and the’Selective Service S_vstem.
the new policy is "expected to stimulate recruiting
for the National Guard and the Reserve forces.‘The
Guard and Reserve /forces are estimated to be 40.-
000 men below their authorized strength. and both
Secretar_v of Defense Melvin Laird and Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense Kenneth Rush have recently ex-
pressed concern over this situation.

The only option open to men who had received
induction orders in past months was to join one of
the Regular branches of the service for at least
three years active duty. No Guard or Reserve enlist
ments or appointments were authorized after the
mailing of induction orders.

The new policy requires that men complete en-
listment or appointment processing in the Guard.
Reserves. or Regular forces at least 10 days prior
to their scheduled induction dates. All registrants
are given 30 days‘ notice of induction. so men who
receive induction orders after July liwill have 20
days to effect enlistments or appointments. In or-
der to allow men scheduled for induction in early

July to take advantage of the new-policy. Acting Di- ‘

rector Byron V. Pepitone has authorized local
boards to postpone for 15 days the induction of men

scheduled to report between July 1-15 if they are
actively being processed for enlistment or appoint-
ment and if they request such action. ’

Men who receive induction orders and desire to
enter in the Guard or Reserve must locate unit va-
cancies on their own. They should request that their
enlistments or appointments be expedited in order
to meet the 10-day requirement. Enlistments or ap-
pointments in the Guard or Reserves require at
least four months active ‘duty for training and the
balance of six years participating in the Ready Re-
serve. Such enlistments or appointments do not re-
duce the obligation of the Selective Service System
to provide requested numbers of inductees to the
Arm_v. - ’

Men are expected to report for induction as
scheduled if enlistments or appointments are not
completed at least 10 days prior to the date sched-
uled for induction. It is expected that this new po-
licy will raise the year-end Uniform National Call
lottery number, although the degree of change will
not be evident until officials determine how many
men under induction orders enter Guard, Reserve
or Regular force units._ This week the Selective
Service System announced that RSN 75 would be the
highest number to be reached to satisfy August
draft calls. Officials do not anticipate a major in-
crease in this number in order to satisfy the total
requirements for this year.

The Defense Department has announced that no
more than 50.000 men will be drafted during 1972.
Fifteenthousand men are expected to be inducted
during April. May and June. An additional 7.200
are expected to be inducted in July and 8.900 in
August. -

Takes Greater Administrative Role

  Markus Named Associate Dean

by MIKE MILLER

The Office of Student Affairs
has ‘announced the appointmentof
William Markus to the position of
Associate Dean of Student Affairs.

Markus. who is currently serv-
ing as Director of Student Activ-
ities. assumed his new post July I.

In addition to retaining primary
responsibility for the Student Ac-
tivities area Markus will take on
administrative duties.

“It'll involve broader respon-
sibilities in the area of Student
.—\ffairs." Markus said. "'1 will be
assisting the Dean in polic_v for-
mation for the entire area. plan-
ning budgets and salary adminis-

the Dean in his absence. He has a
very busy meeting schedule and I
will represent him on some occa-
sions." A

Markus said that this year he is
more optimistic about the work
being done by the Office of Student
Affairs than in his previous five
years in the area.

“I'm generally very pleased
with the progress that Dr. Moye
has made for the area. We’re
slowly but surely solving prob-
lems and getting our house in or-
der.

Some of the objectives which
.\larkus plans to pursue in his new
post include finding a solution to
the Student t'nion problem. This
will involve making progress on a

. new building or renovating the old

llll(_'.

 

 

.\Iarkus also hopes to develop
an internship program in Student
Affairs for graduate students in
the School of Education.

“They get the theoretical con-

structs in class and they can get
practical experience here,"
Markus said.

"Our objective is to build the
best possible staff to meet stu-
dent needs through services and
programs.”

Student .-\t'l'airs is currently ex-
periencing a reoi'gaiii7.ation in the
wake of stall changes and trans-
ters.

Dr. Konnilyn Feig. Director of
Special Programs; Eleanor

Walsh, Director of Student Pub-
lications, and Marsha Haley, Ad-
visor to Pan-Hel have left the area
entirely.

WPGH Cries Foul
Over Allocation Cut

b_vJIM HOSEK
“I feel that the Allocations

. Committee. not being in the radio

business. cannot really evaluate
the needs of WPGH as far as re-
pairs and equipment are concern-
ed."

This is what Barb Jennings.

WPGH operations manager. had...

to say after the June 29 Student
Government meeting. which dealt
with the allocations of WPGH‘s
1972-73 budget.

Prior to the meeting the Allo-
cations Committee had recom-
mended a cut in the WPGH budget

JENNINGS: Gets Axe Job‘

from the suggested $l7,217_to $8,-
694. The SG Board, however, re-
versed many of the Allocations
Committee’s cuts and again sent
the budget back to the committee
level. '

WPGH. which suggested $2.400
to publish 30 issues of a music
survey. was granted only $800 for
10 issues. The Board raised that
amount to $1.200 for 15 issues.

"The Allocations Committee."
said Jennings. “was irrational on
certain parts of the budget and the
survey was one of them.

“Why did they choose ten to be
the number-of issues of the sur-
vey? It's not even enough for half
of a term. . . . Unless they (the
committee) ask specific questions
about an item in the budget, they
have no idea what that organiza-
tion wants to do with that money.

“It is apparent that they have

. no conception of what is done on a

day to day basis at a radio sta-
tion." she added.

'l‘wo areas where WPGH rep-
resentatives were able to con-
vince the Board of a need for
more funds include engineering
maintenance and the cart nia-
chine area.

The Allocations Committee rec-
ommended $l,000 of the 4,309 en-
gineering maintenance request,
stipulating that “emergency re-
quests will be considered, pro-
vided WPGH presents an itemiza-
tion of how the $1,000 was
spent.“

.1. l.. I’ierce. WPGH business
manager. said. “We sent our bud-
get in three months ago. and it is
only being considered‘ now. All
this time is being wasted. We need
this $4.300 for extra funds."

3

 

The Board passed the request 

with a 4-1 vote.

Regarding the cart machines,«.',',-_-i'i
recommended that-  :_

the Board
WPGH buy two new cart ma-

chines ($5.000), instead of the one , 

($2;500) recommened by the Al-
locations Committee. The Board's

nreséllﬁlmendations will go back to

the Allocations Committee, and
will be presented to the Board
again for final approval.

Afterwards, Jennings‘ express-, 

ed her ideas concerning the Allo-

cations Committee in general.  i
“The Committee,” said. “is nota ~,  

good idea. ' A. .

"A group of people who know
nothing about the organizations
make allocations for things that
mean nothing to them.

“I know some of the people on‘
the Allocations Committee have
other affiliations and‘ that they're
out to do an ‘axe job‘ oncertain‘
organizations.

_ "I just think." she added. “there
‘are better ways to do things.“

In other business, a suggestion
was made by Bailey to write a let-
ter to Mayor Peter. Flaherty and
the City Council concerning the
one-way Forbes Avenue traffic.
“It's almost impossible,” he said,
“to cross the street in the Hillman
Library area . . . the cars are just
too fast for the pedestrians.”

BAILEY: Traffic Problems

He recommended that a flash-
ing yellow light be placed in the

middle of Forbes Avenue near‘Da- _

vid Lawrence Hall "to safeguard‘
the pedestrian." The letter. when
written. must be approved by the
Board.

Earlier in the meeting. the Wil-
liam Pitt Debating Union‘s budget
of $9.000 was passed. but not with-
out difficulty.

The Debate Union was question-
ed on the presence of their facul-
ty advisor‘s (Dr. Kane) office on
the fourth floor o_f the Student Un-
ion. which is a "student floor."

“It is a student floor,” said

Terri Weaver, SG Board member, “

“andhe should not be there.”

“I'm satisfied with their bud-
get,” added Tom Bailey, Board
president, “and I hate to" play po-
lities, but we ought to get the
room taken aivay.”

The Board. however. decided

against that idea and the budget.

was passed unanimously.

concern for the individual candi-
date than for his party affiliation.
so that candidates from both par-
ties may be elected to offices in
the same state or district. All in
all it appears that these old pros
in the Democratic party have
pushed their panic button a bit
prematurely.

The concern is only one of sev-
eral indications of the seriousness
with which a McGovern candidacy
is now being taken. The names of
potential running mates are begin-
ning to be tossed around, with
such personalities as Senator Ad-
lai Stevenson, III of Illinois, Flori-
da Governor Reuben Askew and
Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana
having been mentioned in the
press as possible vice-presiden-
tial candidates.

Congressman Wilbur Mills has
also been suggested as a vice-
presidential choice that would im-
prove Democratic chances in the
South.

Those on the losing side of the

ABOUT YOUR

  

primary contests are looking to
the convention as their last ditch
stand against the McGovern
stcamroller. Hubert Humphrey is
making overtures to the Wallace
bloc in hopes of building a shaky
alliance of 700 or 800 delegates to
slow the front runner into a dead-
locked convention. '

Southern governors as well as
some from northern states have
launched a "stop McGovern”
drive in hopes of denying him the
party's nomination.

Yet the party regulars probably
realize that they are playing with
fire -in their belated attempts to
thwart the McGovern activists. A
combination of a possible 1,200 or
more delegates firmly committed
to the senator and national televi-
sion coverage of the floor action
at Miami will make it extremely
difficult for the opposition to steal

‘the nomination and emerge with

anything but the shattered re-
mains of'a national party.

While a i\«IcGovern nomination
is at this point far from inevitable.
the prospects look good for a fair-
ly open convention that will make
such a nomination more feasible
than in the conditions that prevail-

_ ed at the Chicago convention in

1968.

The routine wheeling and deal-
ing of convention politics will un-
doubtedly take place in Miami, but
most state delegations will not be
under the thum of party bosses,
the open delegate selection pro-
cess will have created a new and
more representative nominating
process.

Coupled with new procedures
will be a sea of new faces; a sur-
vey of the delegates selected to
date reveals that some 86 per cent
will be attending their first nation-
al convention.

less on one of "superstars."

its roughness and gutsiness ap-

Graham doesn’t let loose too
much either, except on “South-

George Jupin. a Hempfield High product and
high jump state champion. was also grabbed by
Banner. With his 6"8“ i" jump. Jupin could provide
immediate help in the field events. Jupin joins last
years state champ Tim Riley. who began showing
in the later parts of the outdoor season.

 

The idea of having two Pennsylvanian state
champs fighting for one position is a very comfort-
ing thought for a coach. Brown concurs.

“I think they’ll do a lot for our field events,"

Brown said.

To go along with these specialists. Banner has
also convinced Jack Patrick. a Charleroi whiz who
does everything.

“His times say a whole lot." analyzed Brown.
"He only worked for about two months and he ran
a 1:54'half mile and 48.5 in his leg of the mile relay.
And he also ran a 4 :24 mile. He's a bigstrong kid."

Ed Totain from Mars, Pa., and Steven Jene-
sin, both 49.5 quartermilers will also head Pitt’s
way. Both reputedly have the makings to be very

good.

Unfortunately. Banner didn‘t fill the void in the
javelin. shot put. and the pole vault events. Walk-
ons will try their hand at them. but Banner couldn‘t
recruit topnotchers. Lindoubtedly. he could have re—
cruited athletes for these positions but because of
his qualitative approach. he wants people whocan
step right in the big meets. Hewould have liked to
get a 16 foot pole vaulter. a 50 to 60 foot shotputter.
and a 200 foot javelin thrower. but judging from
what he did get. he didn‘t do bad at all.

I ntrarnurrtl Programs

Merge, Bemis At Head

The men's and \\'otnetrs intramural offices will
work as one next fall. according to men's l.\l Ui-
reetor Leo Bemis. Bemis. who feels that women
aren't offered an elaborate intramural program
would like to provide one. where women can parti-
cipate in some sort of extra-eurricular activity.

"We feel that by uniting we can provide admin-
istrative organr/.ation through this office. We want
to co-ordinate and make use of facilities by work-
ing out of one office." said Bemis in announcing the
merger. brought about by a meeting earlier in the
spring.

Bemis will serve as the top head in the new
setup with .\Iarlene Uarone. undergraduate upper-
classwoman. serving‘ as the woman’s director.

'Also working for Bemis in the fall will be an under-
graduate man. whose purpose it will be to make
sure that all men are aware of intramural events
available to them.

“Not all high schools have intramural pro-

grams for men," continued Bemis. “Women sel-
dom have opportunities open to them in the high
schools. We want to get the girls into our program.

"Girls were very interested in the possibilities
during the orientation program and I think there
are some real possibilities for developing an intra-
mural Co-Ed sports program."

Bemis is thinking in terms oi’ offering co-ed
volleyball. paddle ball. as well as the addition of a
water sport. swimming. Also. there is the possibil-
ity of a raquet sport. perhaps badmitton.

Besides beefing up administration, taking on
more duties to expand the IM program, and a co-ed
program, the main objective will be to expand the
sports already available as well as bringing in a
waterevent, according to Bemis. _

Bemis concluded by saying. --we are certainly—
looking forwward to liaving a program like the
man's program for the women." ‘

Despite the unusually bad weath-
' this area has experienced so
far this summer. the Intramural
softball schedule has. for the most
part. been played without two
many interruptions.

rt .

The rain has taken its toll of a
number of scheduled events. but
just as many forfeits have played
as much a role as the rain.

Most of the original 38 teams
are still playing and barring any
major unforseen difficulties the
[M program should have a crown-
ed champion sometime in August.
