Spirited exchanges between Pitt repre-
sentatives and several Oakland citizen’s
groups concerning the location of Pitt’s
convocation center/basketball arena
highlighted a community forum last
Saturday.

“Mark my words, the basketball arena
will be built on the Hill, regardless of
what Pitt is saying now,” said Marshall
Goodwin, a member of Preservation
Pittsburgh, one of approximately 150
people in ‘attendance.

Senior vice-chancellor for business
and finance Ben Tuchi said that the deci-
sion has not been made yet.

“On the issue of building the convoca-
tion center, you can forget it,” Betty
Lane, of the Pittsburgh Advisory
Committee on Housing and Community
Development, said. »

Pitt ‘representatives responded to
questions concerning housing, universi-
ty expansion, resident employment and
community/university relations submit-
ted by the Oakland Community
Coalition, the umbrella organization for
15 community groups.

“Pitt and the UPMC [University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center] must recog-
nize that at times its actions threaten the
existence of community resources which
benefit the A neighborhood and
Pitt/UPMC, and it has a responsibility to
compensate for this,” said Caroline
Boyce, director of Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation. ‘

The proposed sites for the convoca-
tion center/basketball arena have been
reduced to three from the original list of
10. Director of Facilities Management
Ana Guzman said the sites still under
consideration are the OC lot and prac-

tice field; the stadium area, both above
and below ground and the Schenley
Plaza area, between Forbes Quad and
the Carneigie Museum, both above and
below ground.

In response to a question concerning
Pitt’s commitment to build the convoca-
tion center in the face of community dis-
sent, Tuchi said, “My first priority is. the
students, my second is the university fac-

ulty and staff and my third is the com- .

munity at large.” .

The forum, sponsored by OCC and
moderated by the League of Women
Voters, was initiated to provide the
opportunity for the community, the uni-
versity, and the City of Pittsburgh’s
Department of City‘ Planning to
exchange information and concerns
about the university’s master plan for

Murphy
Wins race
for mayor

As predicted, Tom Murphy won
Pittsburgh's mayoral,race in a land-
slide victoiy. .

Democrat Murphy took 68.2 per-
cent of the vote and was followed
by Democratic candidate Jack
Wagner who received 26.6 per-
cent of the vote, according to
KDKA.. '

University Democrats President
Dave Diulius said he was pleased
with the results.

"What else can you say but it's a
blowout. Murphy is the best choice
for mayor. Jack Wagner wouldn't
have been a bad mayor, he's done
a lot for city council and brought a
lot of professionalism to it, but

mayor," he said.

However, College Republicans
President Eric Lurie said the
Democrats shouldn't get too confi-
dent with their primary victory.

"Because it's Pittsburgh, a union
city, newscasters take for granted
that because a Democrat won his
or her primary that they'll win the
election. We're going to show in a
couple of months that is not the
case. Republicans are going to take
a number of seats that are written
off as won for Democrats," Lurie
said.

According to KDKA’s newsroom,
the mayoral votes were distributed
as follows:

Tom Murphy, 49,230

Jack Wagner, 19,368

Gary Henderson, 1,807

Chaston Roston, 1,035

Robert Pirchesky, 937

Theft still leads

By Frank Porco
Asst. News Editor

Theft, harassment by phone
and criminal mischief continue
to be the largest crimes affecting
Pitt’s campus.

Theft continues to be the
largest crime on Pitt’s campus,
according to crime statistics
published by the Department of
Public Safety.

Theft was on the decline,
from 50 incidents reported in
January, until March when it
reached a low of 27 reports. It
climbed again in April to a high
of 42 reported cases.

— According to Gary Moses,
assistant director of Public
Safety, a significant number of
thefts occur in the libraries on
campus. During the month of
February, coats were a popular
item to be stolen, he said.

In response to the increase of
theft in April, Moses said that
valuables should be locked in
desks or file cabinets and not be

left out in the open.

Harassment by phone is the
second largest crime reported to
campus police.

The number of incidents
reported declined from 19 in
January to seven in March, but
was on the rise in April with
nine reported.

According to Moses, harass-

ment by communication is a
misdemeanor criminal offense.
If convicted, a person could
face one year in jail and/or a
$2,500 fine.
2 Criminal mischief is the third
largest crime reported to cam-
pus police. It declined from 15
reported injanuary to 11 report-
ed in March and then rose to 19
reported in April.

According to the statistics, the
lower campus —- the area
including all property and
buildings south of Fifth Avenue
and bordered by McKee Place,
North Bellefield and Boundary
Street — continues to be the
area with the most crime report-

campus crime stats

ed. Over the four—month span
between January and April 53

‘percent of crimes reported to

campus police were committed
in that area.

The crime rate is high in this
area because of the number of
students found there, according
to Moses.

“The one-block area between
Bigelow Boulevard and
Bouquet Street is filled with
dorms; that’s roughly 6,000 stu-
dents that live in that area,”
Moses said.

Campus police have taken
steps to decrease the numbers
of crimes in the lower campus
area by having an officer in the
residence-hall area seven days a
week, 24 hours a day, Moses
said.

“We have taken many steps to
decrease crime in that area as
well as other areas,” Moses said.
“We have increased the number
of plainclothes policemen and
continue to hold safety seminars
all over campus.”

Brackenridge and Amos
halls will be undergoing a $1
million facelift this summer,
according to Robert Hopkins,
direc_tor of Housing.

The Housing Office has
spent close to $1 million to
hire contractors to upgrade
living and safety conditions in
Amos and Brackenridge halls
and also make improvements
in Towers B and C.

“We want to make housing
more pleasurable, comfort-
able and safe for students liv-
ing on campus,” Hopkins
said.

Close to $500,000 is being
spent on both Brackenridge
and Amos halls. The money
comes from the University
Renewal and Replacement
account-that exists from left-
over university revenue and

halls undergo facelift

student and tenant fees.
according to Hopkins.

“Amos Hall will be fur-
nished with completely new
wiring and outlets," Hopkins
said. “Outlets will increase
from 53 percent to 50 percent,
depending on space."

in addition to new hallway
lights and paddle-fan lights on
the ceiling of the rooms, risk
of electrical fires will be
reduced because students will
not have to use a lot of exten-
sion cords, according to
Hopkins. Brackenridge Hall
will become a fire suppres-
sion system once the new
sprinkler system is finished,
he said.

“A new fire-alarm system
means there will be more
smoke detectors around, not
to mention lights that will
visually ﬂash for students who
are hard of hearing,” Hopkins
said. This sophisticated sys-
tem has been needed for a

long time to ensure. safety to
all students living there,
according to Hopkins.

“There is a lot of work to be
done to these places before
we start painting them in
August,” Hopkins said.
"Contractors should be done
by the first day of that month,
and we will have to paint and
refurnish both buildings.
Contractors only‘ have to
clean until the place is broom
clean and paint over holes,
but we want students to have
‘a really nice place to live next
year.”-

“Tower C is also being
painted from top to bottom. It
has held students for [summer
classes] in the past, but for
this year’s first term we
moved them to Lothrop Hall,”
Hopkins said.

Merchants
to improve
customer
relations

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Oakland businesses should
treat their customers exception-
ally well if they want to
decrease crime and increase
profits, according to business
consultant Robert Sprague.

“Generally college students
are treated very badly,” Sprague
said. “If you create an oasis
away from their hard—edged
environment, they will respond.
That’s why cafes and bars are so
popular with students.”

Representatives from Angel’s
Corner Restaurant, Caleco’s,
Copy Cat, Forbes Avenue Giant
Eagle and Mailboxes, Etc. met in
the William Pitt Union on
Tuesday morning for Sprague’s
Top Shops Seminar to discuss
retail patterns and successful
strategies for better business.

Sprague said that college stu-
dents and other customers are

looking more for an experience, I

not just a product when they

_ enter a business. “People pay

two dollars for a cappucino at
the Beehive. Why? They want
the atmosphere rather than a
cup of coffee.”

Crimes such as shoplifting
decrease when businesses cre-
ate a small, friendly, personal
environment — something most
Oakland businesses fail to do,

Sprague said. He then told of a ‘

store owner who caught a
minor stealing, but didn’t turn
him in because that would have
created mutual distrust.

“Rather than turning the kid in
and then later having his win-
dows smashed, the owner
asked the boy to please not to
steal from his store and asked
him if he would like to buy the
product. He did.”

Sprague said that it comes
down to the personalities of the
employees when people
choose where they’re going to
spend their money. “Do any-

_ thing you can do to make your

stores more intimate,” he said.
“Who’s going to rip off a, really
nice waitress?”

When Angel’s Corner
Restaurant owner Chuck Davis
complained of an apathetic
trend in employees, Sprague
suggested hiring people for
their personalities rather than
for experience. He also suggest-
ed increasing salaries of current
employees above minimum

Library expansion plans
may include old Temple

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

Pitt‘s newest library may be
nothing new at all.

Tentative plans are for Pitt to
acquire the historic Masonic
Temple located on Fifth Avenue
across from the Cathedral of
Learning. Pitt hopes to convert
the ten-story building into its
newest library, according to Ana
Guzman, director of Facilities
Management for the university.

“Nothing has been finalized
yet, but it is part of our expan-
sion plans,” Guzman said.

Additional library space has
been at the top of everyone’s
wish list, according to Guzman.

The early plans call for the
conversion of the Masonic
Temple and expansion of
Hillman Library.

Upon the completion of the
expansion, the existing library
will be updated.

“Hillman is 25—years-old and
the mechanicals all need to’ be
brought up to spec,” Guzman
said.

The Masons haven’t found a
new location yet, and a contin-
gency for the deal is that the
group approves a new site,
according to Bill Van Dyke,
president of the Masonic Fund
Society.

“Until a new site is found. and
our move is complete, the

Masons will continue to occupy
part of the temple,” Van Dyke
said.

In its heyday of the 19305, 405
and 505, the Masonic Temple
housed 33 lodges and organiza-
tions. “We have a 1,200—seat

_ auditorium and numerous meet-

ing rooms, which were booked
all day long,” Van Dyke said.

The Masons were interested
in having the building remain
historically intact, according to
Van Dyke. For that reason, the
university was the primary can-
didate to take over the building,
Van Dyke said.

Local architects Asterino and
Associates are doing the prelim-
inary work on the temple. No
one from the firm could be
reached for comment concern-
ing the plans for the Temple.

Pam Vance, assistant director
for administration for University
Library Services, said the univer-
sity is still in the functional—data
gathering stages. “The idea is to
centralize the archival depart-
ment, which is currently spread
around in several locations.”

When the Hillman Library
expansion is completed,
according to Vance, additional
seating space will be available
for students and researchers.

A planning committee is look-
ing at current and projected uni-
versity needs. There is no firm
date for construction to begin.

Fast food court replaces Schenley

By Donald R. Lankey
For The Pitt News

Students will have expand-
ed buying power with their
choice dollars starting this
fall.

The renovation of Schenley
Cafe into a food court will be
completed by September.

The Schenley Cafe will be
closed during the months of
May through most of August
to undergo a complete reno-
vation that will expand
options and food selections
for students to purchase and
use their choice dollars

The existing cafe will be
expanded to include a take-
out bakery, complete deli,
soup—and-salad bar, a grill
and entree format, a Pizza
Hut and Manchu Wok, an ori-
ental restaurant, according. to
Betsy Sallade—Farina, director

of Food Services.

The improved food selec-
tion will resemble a food
court found in shopping
malls but will not reduce the
present seating capacity.

“The renovation is being
done for the students to give
a much better facility to dine
in,” said John DeVitto, assis-
tant vice chancellor of busi-
ness.

“You have to upgrade the
services to offer a better vari-
ety,” he said.

The renovation of the Cafe
will cost approximately $1
million.

Students and other people
on the campus grounds can
use the cafeterias in
Sutherland and Lothrop Halls
and one of the two sides of
the Towers cafeteria during
the renovation.

The outdoor cafe beside

the patio of the William Pitt
Union has been expanded to
offer some hot-grill items
while the Schenley Cafe is
closed. 1

Other food services will be
kept open in different areas
of the campus during the
summer with the various con-
ferences going on around the
university.

“The students will have
more purchasing flexibility
and use their choice dollars
program for their board plans
in the evenings between the
hours of 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. at
the cafe,” said Sallade—Farina.

The food committee is
working on a “cash equiva-
lency” program that would
allot students a certain
amount o-f money for meals
to rise at the food court that
they wouldn't use at the cafe-
terias.

Malcolm X celebration promotes unity

By Brian Lehew
For The Pitt News

Can a chicken produce a
duck’s egg? ’

This is the question that
Malcolm X put forth concerning
the ability of America to pro-
duce freedom for African-
American people.

This question will be evaluat-
ed again as Pitt’s Kuntu
Repertory Theatre and the
Malcolm X Holiday Commission
gear up for the fourth annual
National Malcolm X Celebration
to be held on Saturday, May 22,
at 1 p.m. in David Lawrence
Hall Auditorium.

The celebration will feature
award-winning playwright
August Wilson and Sara
Mitchell, former coordinating

secretary of Malcolm X’s
Organization of Afro-American
Unity.

There will be a variety of cul-
tural performers, including elec-
tric jazz violinist Rodney McCoy
and poets Turhan Shabazz and
B-Tree. Rapper Tuffie Tuf will
also perform during the festivi-
ties.

Pitt

student Nzingha

' (Michelle) Campbell will lead

the Malcolm X unity ritual
which asks that all African
Americans unite in a commit-
ment towards a better tomorrow
for the African-American peo-
ple.

“The holiday is a practical one
with a theme of unity,” accord-
ing to Lee Kiburi, chair of the
Malcolm X Holiday
Commission. “It must gain the

consent of the entire African-
American community to be
viable.”

The practical goal of the cele-
bration is to promote Pan-
Africanism, which is the cultural
union of Afro-Americans to their
origins in Africa.

Members of the African-
American community are asked
to abstain from all drugs, includ-
ing alcohol and nicotine, from
12 a.m. on May 22 to 12 a.m. on
May 23, in celebration of
Malcolm X’s triumph over
drugs. They are also asked to
wear some article of African
clothing to symbolize a cultural
return to Africa.

In addition to the celebration,
a 24-hour hotline has been set
up which offers information to
callers on the significance of the

holiday. Callers will learn about
the Malcolm X Unity Ritual, the
Malcolm X Commitments and
the four symbols of Malcolm X
day.

One of these symbols is the
Malcolm X flag. The flag con-
tains the colors black, red and
green. Black represents the peo-
ple, red symbolizes change by
any means necessary and green
stands for freedom.

Callers will also learn the
Malcolm X question — Can a
chicken produce a duck’s egg?
—‘ which encourages people to
critically analyze the African-
American- place in American
society, find what is wrong with
the system and decide what
must be done to correct it.

The hotline number is 624-
7298.

Smozllfirms betterfor Russia, says UCLA prof

By Gregory T. Wieclaw, Jr.
For The Pitt News '

A leading scholar on firm organization
and corporate governance told graduate
students why small companies are better
for Russia than larger ones.

Harold Demsetz, economics‘ professor
at UCLA and author of Owners/9-tp Control
and the Firm, spoke Monday afternoon in
Mervis Hall and explained how wealth
distribution affects the control of compa-
nies in the United States, Russia and
Eastern Europe.

“The wealth of the country and the dis-
tribution of wealth within a country deter-
mines the degree to which you can con-
centrate ownership,” Demsetz said.

   

“The wealthier a country, the more you
can concentrate the ownership of large
corporations without a large risk.”

According to Demsetz, a large number
of stockholders increases the number of
people to watch over the corporation and
management, while also decreasing risks
of operation.

He also said the severity of the control
over enterprise is a product ofsocial
organization.

“Socialistic factories will not turn out
the same goods at the same quality of
capitalistic factories even if the same
knowledge and resource base exists
because of fundamentalistic differences in
societies,” he said. “Knowledge and
resources can be bought off of any coun-

Demsetz went on to tell his attentive
audience that no nation could solve a
control problem if it wants to have large
firms.

He said if there are big corporations a
country could remain equal and remained
focused on small enterprise. He recom-
mended this for Russia.

“As soon as a country decides it wants
steel or nuclear capabilities, it will lose
control,” Demsetz said.

Mystery
illness
studied

By Dave Titmus
For tbe Pitt News

Pitt doctors are
researching various treat-
ments for patients who
say they are ill though
there are no biological or
medical reasons for their
complaints.

“With somatizing
patients, the pain is real to
them and the doctor is
only getting a shade of
their pain,” said Frank
deGruy, associate profes-
sor at the University of
South Alabama College of
Medicine. “Labeling
patients as somatizers,
however, may do more
harm to the individual by
placing him in with what
he may see as a negative
group.”

The treatment of
patients with somatoform
disorders, those due to
psychological or social
problems that cause phys-

ical symptoms in the -

absence of an actual bio-
logical illness, was dis-
cussed by researchers
Friday at the William Pitt
Union.

Sponsored by Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, the program high-
lighted ways that doctors
can treat a somatizing
patient. Somatizing
patients can become
angered and distrustful of
the doctors that treat them
because the doctors are
reluctant to say that they
have a biological illness,
according to deGruy.

It is difficult for doctors
to properly treat the
patient because “it is not
clear what psychosomatic
disorders [those of the
mind] are,” said Jamie
Mullen, a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh
School
Somatization is very
vague; each symptom
needs to be looked at
separately, according to
Mullen.

“Somatic disorders
affect society as a whole,”
Mullen said. “People that
are afﬂicted with this suf-
fer from lost wages, lost
hours on the job and a
crumbling family struc-
ture.”

Because of the few
signs of improvement,
time-consuming research
and visitatiolns with the
patient, it is often non-
advantageous and unre-
warding for the doctor to
treat a somatizing patient,
according to Mullen.
“Treating the somatizing
patient can be rewarding,
but the doctor’s expecta-

tions and time must be.

limited.”

A small, handheld computer
is the key to an innovative new
technology in helping people
to quit smoking. The computer
allows the person to self-moni-
tor the feelings, behavior and
situations incurred during the
quitting process, according to
Pitt researchers.

Part of the University of
Pittsburgh’s psychology
department, the program is
offering help to smokers in
exchange for information
entered into the computers.
The computer functions mostly
to determine what people

’ experience when they quit and
what situations tempt a person
to smoke, according to study
researcher Jean Paty.

 is a research study, not

Hand computer helps smokers quit

a new treatment. But in the
process, we’re offering treat-
ment to help quit smoking.
We’re trying to understand
smoking better so that some-
time down the road we can
come up with a better treat-
ment,” he said.

When subjects get an urge to
smoke, they push a button on
the computer which in turn
requires the subject to answer
questions. These questions
identify internal and external
stimuli, like current mood,
activities, location and pres-
ence of other smokers

This technology is much

more effective than the tradi- g

tional paper-and-pencil
method of self-monitoring
smoking habits, according to
Paty.

The study should also pro-
duce new information on the

processes relating relapses to
smoking, and what people
should expect when they quit,
such as how to cope with dif-
ferent situations during absti-
nence from smoking,
researchers said.

The idea was adapted from a
similar procedure used by the
American Cancer Society. Pitt
is currently collaborating with
the Research Institute in
Buffalo, where the same type
of computer collects data on
drinking behavior.Although
the overall percentage of
smokers is decreasing, the per-
centage of women smokers is
increasing, according to
national statistics.

Those interested in partici-
pating must be regular smok-
ers and at least 21-years-old.

The Jump Start Program is the
multi—million dollar funding
passed by the Pennsylvania leg-
islature for construction and
renovation at state—sponsored
universities.Other projects
under consideration’ for Jump
Start monies, at ’Pitt are the.
Hillman Library expansion, the
Multi-purpose Academic Center,
and the building of new dorms.

“This forum is the beginning
of a joint process between
Pitt/UPMC and the community.
OPDC is committed to its partic-
ipation. We think that it is possi-
ble for Pitt/UPMC to coexist in
an environmenfgood for all.
The cornerstone for success is a
Pitt/UPMC master plan that
reflects a win/win situation,”
Boyce said. ,

The city planning department
has required Pitt to submit a

five—year plan prior to authoriz-
ing any new construction. A 10-
year plan must be submitted
before construction of a second
building. Both would be part of
the 20-year master plan being
prepared by the university.

which it is a part can never be

“lights go off,” it is drug sensitive and the drug will work, said
Hatfull.

“TB grows slowly, previously causing the search for the right
drug to take 12 to 13 weeks. We’ve shown we can greatly increase
the sensitivity of the test so we can detect a very small amount.
Instead of waiting for them to grow, we can detect them in a very
short time,” said Hatfull.

I really hope the weather evens out soon for the students until the
second term begins and they move back into the towers.”

The upper eight ﬂoors of Tower B are also being improved.
Hopkins said these floors were “literally almost original,” and that
the old linoleum floors would be carpeted and rooms would be
painted. He also said the old “dayroom” design would be modified.

“The rooms on these floors were designed to be just sleeping
rooms, but then when you pull both beds out they touch and
there’s no place to move,” he said. “The only way this is not a prob-
lem is if both students go to bed at the same time.” .

Hopkins said all four projects would be ready by the end of
August when students will be returning. First-year students move in
on August 20, and all other students move in August 27 and 28.

Since independent retailers don’t feel very connected with each

Oakland can know when a crime occurs.
“Communication and being aware of what’s happening could

Anotherway Sprague said businesses could increase safety is to
install brighter lights in their stores. 
“Fluorescent lights are inexpensive, and if you lighta place, you
move crime away from it,” Sprague said. “And 24-hour lighting is a

Get The Balance Right

A struggle between the right to free speech and the
right to redress racial harassment is being played out on
college campuses across America.

Academic institutions should foster personal growth
and learning through the unfettered exchange of ideas
—- or the marketplace of ideas. On the other hand,
racism and bigotry are viewed as anathema and impede
the university mission. Ideally, a university ought‘ to be
the one environment where an individual is free from
harassment. To this end, many schools have justifiably
enacted rules of conduct guarding against harassment.

Yet so often, freedom from harassment clashes with
assertion of free speech rights. This struggle has been
dramatically highlighted at the University of
Pennsylvania and has garnered criticism and embar-
rassed the university administration;

'- Around midnight, January 15, 1.995, a group of

African—American sorority sisters were making noise
near first—year Penn student Eden Jacobowitz’s dormito-
ry. Disturbed by the commotion while studying, he

. yelled, “Shut up, you water buffalo,” joining the chorus

of shouting students.The women were offended by
what they thought were vulgar comments and com-
plained to the campus police. During an investigation,
Mr. Jacobowitz freely admitted to making the “buffalo”
comment; all other students denied any shouting.

Based on his admission, it was decided two months
later that Jacobowitz violated the university’s racial
harassment code. The university offered to drop any
charges against Jacobowitz if he agreed to apologize
and to be put on dormitory probation. He said “no,” and
plans to challenge any punitive action in court.”

At the core of this issue is the question: was the “water
buffalo” remark racist? The Israeli—born Mr. Jacobowitz
claims that “water buffalo” is the translation of a
Hebrewword that is used to scold an unruly person. He
has denied that the comment was racially motivated.

It appears that Mr. Jacobowitz meant no offense by his
phrase. He simply wanted some peace and quiet.

The repercussions of this issue have gone far beyond
one person’s right to free speech. It exemplifies the
racial tension felt on college campuses across the coun-
try. Additionally, the case indicates that Penn’s harass-
ment code is vague. It only states that students are not
to “inflict direct injury” on others. Using a racial slur is
inappropriate and warrants action, but Jacobowitz’s
comment seems to indicate his frustration over noisy
behavior.

Other colleges and universities would do well to ~

examine their own speech codes. A careful examination
—— and necessary clarification ‘— of the rules guiding
what is permissible and what is not permissible ought to
be made before those rules are put to the test. Actions
taken by Penn trivialize a harassment policy’s impor—.
tance. J

Media orib

Across America -university administrators are
performing alcomplicated tight-rope act balanc-
ing supposed free speech claims against equal
opportunity mandates. This performance’ not only
involves students facing harassment allegations
but can also involve university employees.

For instance, on May 11, the deposed chair of
the City College’s black studies program,. Leonard
Jeffries, won his federal suit against the school.
Jeffries maintained that his demotion was in retal-

iation to his constitutionally pro— Jeffries monetary damages. But this
tected speech; the jury and judge  simple “free speech” case became,

ark
  Sﬂlith

also reached this conclusion.

Yet by the evening, the story
played on ABC's Nightline as thel
following: an African-Arnerican
professor, because of his race, was
free to speak his mind while poor,
down-trodden white professors, students or just
about everyone else oncampus was censored by
nasty women and minorities.

Popular media offers a poor analysis which fur-
ther clouds reasonable discussions in these mat-
ters. So often, free speech issues rest upon domi-
nant, yet inaccurate, notions of constitutional law
and the American tradition of civil liberties.

Other networks erroneously reached similar
conclusions, leaving one to wonder what inten-
tions guide the media.

Jeffries sparked racial flames during a speech
before the Empire State Black Arts and Cultural
Festival in Albany. He spoke of including more
lessons on cultures long neglected from public
schooling; however, it was not these comments
which fanned the fire. A l_

Jeffries spoke of a “systematic, unrelenting”
attack by the Jewish community against African-
American scholars. He also stated, “Russian Jewry
had a particular control over the movies [in
Hollywood] and their financial partners, the
Mafia, put together a financial system of destruc-
tion of black people” and that Jews helped
finance the slave trade.

All these claims, whether factual or not, pro-
voked swift and fierce condemnation from many
prominent New Yorkers; many viewed the
speech as anti—Semitic and racist. New York
Governor Mario Cuomo and City College’s
Trustees publicly chided the professor. Senator
Alfonse D’Amato called for his resignation.
Perhaps more alarming for City College adminis-
tration was that alumni and contributors threat-
ened to withhold financial support until action
was taken against Jeffries.

By October 1991, College trustees overturned
the faculty’s decision to reappoint Jeffries for 'a
full three-year term; instead, his contract was
renewed only until March 1992. Jeffries was
replaced as chair.

Rather than state that he was relieved from his

     

position for his comments, the City College pur--

bigotry
ported that Jeffries was a poor administrator. This
argument convinced no one since Jeffries was
unanimously re-elected to serve a seventh temi as
the black studies chair a few months prior to his
speech in Albany.

Last week, a jury found in favor‘ of Jeffries and
that City College had violated Jeffries’ right to free
speech. A federal judge will decide whether to
order City College to reinstate the professor as
black studies chair, and the jury. has awarded

embroiled in the current American
racial angst.
ABC” and others have asked if
there was a double standard.
Irnplying that only African
Americans are protected to utter
“offensive” speech, Nightline compared Jeffries’
situation to the brouhaha Cincinnati Reds owner
Marge Schott generated. Schott drew fire for
allegedly making racist comments against African
Americans and Jews; the baseball commissioner
temporarily suspended Schott and fined her.
Nightline probed comparisons between Jeffries
and Jimmy “the Greek” -- the former CBS sports
commentator fired for making racist comments as

well. After all‘, the media chimed, Schott’s racist

comments got her into hot water because she’s
white, but Jeffries got off scot free because he’s
black. __

But no double standard exists.

Jeffries, a public employee, has a different legal
relationship with his employer, the government.
So often, Americans forget that the Constitution
defines the relationship between citizens and the
government. Jeffries, a citizen, has considerable
constitutional protection as an employee of the
government. Jeffries can make a “free speech” or
“due process” claim under the ‘First or Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution.

Schott was a member of a private corporation,
and CBS was “the Greeks” boss. Private employ-
ers do not have to honor a “free speech” right of
its employees or colleagues. Jimmy “the Greek”

A could have been fired for calling his boss a son-

of-a-bitch.

Yet ABC News overlooked this simple fact, and
Ted Koppel grilled his three guests about some
sort of conspiracy to grant African Americans spe-

’ cial rights.

Without the context around Jeffries’ comments,
it is difficult to understand them. On their face,
they appear to be anti—Semitic, but that is irrele-
vant. City College violated his free speech rights;
the feeble excuse for the dismissal fooled no one.
But what remains troubling is the media’s misrep-
resentation of the event contributes to American
bigotry as much as Jeffries could have.

Romero's lates

By Aimee DeFoe
For The Pitt News

The Dar/e Ha_// is Pittsburgher
and Carnegie Mellon University
drama school alumnus George
Romero’s latest excursion into
the realm of terror, this time
examining the hidden recesses
of evil present in the human
mind. Based on. Stephen Kings
novel of the same name, ’/‘be
Dar’/e Ha[f is the story of Thad
Beaumont, a clean-cut family
man and writer who produces
trashy novels under the pseudo-
nym George Stark. When black-
mailer Fred Claussen threatens
to reveal this, he decides to go
public with his secret identity
and declare Stark officially
dead. This fateful action causes
an incarnation of Stark to come
to life as Beaumont’s malevo-
lent alter ego who murders peo-
ple with a razor blade while
calling them things like “old
hoss” and “buddy roo.”

Stark methodically kills all the
people related to Beaumont,
starting with Digger, keeper of
the family grave plot, moving
on to his editors and getting
closer and closer to his family.
Beaumont is the proud father of
nauseatingly cute twins which
Romero’s camera lingers on at
every opportunity, making
absolutely sure we are aware
that there are innocents for
whom to fear. The mother of

these token innocents is played

by Amy Madigan, who some-
how manages to give her char-

acter a minor amount of

strength even though her role is ‘

nothing more than the usual
female horror movie part of
wifely bait for a supernatural,
homicidal maniac.

The film definitely aspires to
be a step above your average

tries to make us think about that
submerged but ever—present
sinister side of us all. Beaumont

and Stark are intended to come

t ckfest aims igh but fas short

 

off as a _]ekyll—and—I-Iyde pair,
and indeed they are opposites,
as Beaumont is mild mannered
to the point of quaintness and
Stark is an Elvis-loving Southern
redneck with slicked-back hair.
This is a good idea, but Romero
fails to take it anywhere and it
just lays ﬂat within the context
of the picture. This criticism is
not altogether fair. If the film

did focus on this jekyll—Hyde
relationship, it would be some-
thing else altogether, so in a
way Romero is confined by his
chosen genre and our precon-
ceptions about it.

Another major problem with
the film is its failure to draw us
into its world. Strangely
enough, this is not due to act-
ing, as Timothy Hutton does a
more-than-adequate job playing

both Beaumont and the fright-
eningly amusing Stark. Nor is
the culprit Romero’s adaptation
of King's novel, which is solidly
done despite the occasionally
cheesy dialogue. Instead it is
the fault of certain details of
character which are designed to
make auxiliary characters seem
eccentric. The film is so chock
full of these details that they

The cover of Bazooka’s CD shows the
trio daintily holding coffee cups and sit-
ting on a divan. Each of the three band
members sports a goatee and a sharp-
looking suit. The black-and—white
photo could have been taken back in
the ‘.503, when this beatnik look came a
dime a dozen. It gives the band a defi—
nite hipster aura. '

The Orange County, Calif. trio might
have titled its CD Perfectly Square, but
these cats ain’t no squares. The band
plays a brand of jazz that combines
hard bop with the freewheeling attitude
of its roots which lie in underground
rock. The end result is a sound that
swings hard and takes a few quick trips
into free-improv territory.

This Thursday the trio will cut up
Pittsburgh when it visits our own
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern.

Vince Meghrouni (drums), Tony

Atherton (saxophones) and Bill

Crawford (bass) played together in El
Grupo Sexo, a band which predated the
funk-rock style popularized later by the
Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No
More.

When their original group disbanded,
the three decided to explore their fasci-
nation with the music of jazz players
such as Thelonious Monk, Lee Morgan
and Art Pepper — and Bazooka was
born.

Rather than attempting to appeal to a
straight-jazz crowd, Bazooka took its
new approach to the same audiences it

Bazoo/ea loops loam’ aa’ rocks with an amazing versatilzfy

knew from its previous band — the
punk and surf (f‘l‘<)W(l. Response proved
to be enthusiastic. The band even found
itself opening for such non-jazz acts as
Adam Ant, fIRF.ll0SI-T and Ween. In a
way, the positive feedback came as no
surprise.

“People react to the energy,” Atherton
said in a recent interview. "There’s a
correlation between what lpunksl listen
to and what they do  We do that too,
because we are playing to the edge of
our abilities and sometimes beyond
that. There’s an element of risk and
power. 

That element of risk appealed to SST
Records, an institution of West—Coast
punk which also released experimental
jazz by Universal Congress Of and Cruel
Frederick. The label released Perfectly
Square last March. .

The album’s notes describe the music
as “a mix of completely written, partial-
ly written and partially improvised and
completely improvised stuff.” Highlights
include “Taboobi,” a multi—section piece
which moves through Eastern territory
and features Atherton blowing two
saxes simultaneously. “In Defense of
Phallic Power Totems II” kicks off the
disc with a repetitive groove, stopping
briefly to jump into free territory and
back out again.

The trio’s versions of pieces by
T helonious Monk and Lee Morgan fit in
so well with its originals that strangers
to the music might not know a Bazooka
tune from the covers.

Earth
Earth 2
Sub Pop

Sub Pop has hit new lows
with the release of Earth 2.

Correction.

Sub Pop has hit absolute rock
bottom with the release of quite
possibly the worst record of all
time.

F.arth consists of Dylan
Carlson on guitar and Dave
Harwell on bass. They don’t
sing or, for that matter, play
anything resembling “songs.”
Imagine heavy metal and new-
age music thrown together in a \
particle accelerator, and you
have an idea of what these two
clowns play. The result sounds
more like the re—creation of a
ride next to an airplane engine

than any type of music.

The band’s CD lists three sep-
arate tracks, but they all run
together, lasting 74 minutes.
Where one cut ends and the
next begins is anyone’s guess
because the whole thing sounds
like one big, sludgy note that '
plods on, ad nauseam.

Not that repetition is always a_
bad thing. Bands like Loop and
Spacemen 5 played one riff into
infinity in an effort to pass the
aura of their heroin bliss on to
listeners. For them, the
approach worked, creating a
captivating trance.

The members of Earth, on the
other hand, sounded like they
learned one chord and
impressed themselves so much
they decided to keep playing it.

And playing it. And playing it.

The tone that resonates
throughout Earth 2 (Carlson
and Harwell may call them
songs, but we know better)
resembles a big pile of mush, an
aural residue oozing out of your
CD or cassette player. It sounds
interesting at first, the way the
guitar and bass buzzzzzzzzzz.

But after the first 50 seconds,
you realize no further move-
ment will happen and the nov-
elty wears off immediately.

Yet the appalling thing about
Earth 2 is not so much that the
record is so unlistenable,
although that’s part of it. The
thought that Sub Pop decided
this disc should see the light of
day at all kills me. I honestly
can’t imagine anyone sitting
through this and enjoying it.
Listening to this malarkey is
about as fun as watching worms
reproduce.

Pomos for Pyros
Po m 05, for Pyros
Warner Bros.

When Perry Farrell disbanded
his much-heralded, Led
Zeppelinesque, alternative rock
act, Jane’s Addiction, he left his
hordes of devotees wondering
how their messiah would rein-
carnate himself. While Farrell
turned his efforts to coorganiz—
ing last year’s Lollapalooza, crit-
ics and fans alike eagerly antici-
pated the unveiling of his new
band, Pornos for Pyros. Rumors
circulated that Farrell would be
searching for an edgier, more
experimental sound than jane’s
Addiction.

Upon first listen, Pornos for
Pyros sounds like a toned—down,
smoother version of Jane’s
Addiction with the distinctively
nasal sounds of Farrell’s alter-
nately lilting and crooning
voice, and the familiar stylings
of former ]ane’s percussionist
Stephen Perkins. The lyrics are
spare and reminiscent of Charles,
Bukowski’s poetry (especially in
the tracks “Bad S—-” and
“Pets”), and they reflect the
ambience of Farrell’s squalid Los
Angeles surroundings. The
instrumentation ranges from
jaunty jazz to confrontational

barrages, often within the same
track, and there is a tinge of
unpredictability which chal-
lenges the listener as the album
unfolds. ‘

For those who proclaim
Farrell to be an alternative rock
icon, this album will be like a
second coming. For those of us
among the nonconverted, this
is justan intriguing, likable
record.

Buell Neidlinger Quartet
Big Drum
K2B2

Pianist Herbie Nichols once
told Buell Neidlinger that new
music will be shaped by a
band’s drummer, and the shoes
of a good drummer are hard to
fill. A

The bassist must have taken
Nichols to heart when he hired
Vinnie Colaiuta to fill the drum
chair in his band. The drummer
played with the quartet only
once prior to the 1990 perfor-
mance that yielded Big Drum.

Neidlinger’s musical career
dates back to the late ‘SOs when
he played in Cecil T aylor’s origi-
nal ground-breaking quartet.
One of the first groups to play
what becameknown as “free
jazz,” the band was met with
controversy immediately. A

Neidlinger and tenor saxo-
phonist Marty Krystal] have
been playing together for 22
years. They’ve penned five of
the eight tunes on Big Drum.
Thematically the songs range
from straight blues to frantic
bop to folk.

pipe that Beaumont’s tmsty sec-

begins to truly engulf us in the
story, one of these pesky partic-

that we are sitting in a theater

There is another element of
the film which works with the
character details to give us the
impression that Romero is sim-

of emphasis is placed on a
swarming mass of birds which
is present whenever Stark and
Beaumont are about to
encounter one another and pro-
vides the grand finale of the
movie by picking George
Stark’s flesh off. This obvious
Hitchcockian reference may be
appropriate for Kings novel,
but in this film it is more of a
cinematic faux pas.

Despite setting a school record for most wins in conference play(10), the Panthers couldn't reach the Big East tournament.

By Tom Schneider

r‘ Staff.‘ Writer ’ L

For the Pitt Baseball team, a season of
great promiseiand vast improvement came
to an abrupt halt when the Panthers fell to
the University of Connecticut ,5-3, on
Saturday. The loss ended the Panthers’
dream of a first-ever Big East playoff berth
as it dropped the team to sixth place, in the
final standings. -

The Panthers finished the season with a
10-11 mark in Big East play, the best confer-
ence record ever for a Pitt team. Despite
their strong 9-5 start, the Panthers struggled
down the stretch, losing six of their last
seven conference games. .

“I don’t thinkyou can point to one thin
[that caused the downslidel,” senior first
baseman Jason Roth said. “As a team, we

didn’t play as well as we were earlier in the
season. I-don’t think we played over our
heads [earlier in the year]  we just seemed
to play down to our competition down’ the
stretch.”

After being manhandled by first—place
Villanova in a 10-2 loss on Thursday, the
Panthers needed a win over UConn and a
St. John’s victory over last place
Georgetown on Sunday in order to secure
the fourth and final playoff spot.

Unfortunately, the Huskies had other
ideas as UConn pitcher John Kelly held the
normally potent Panther offense to just
three runs on eight hits.

“We just weren’t getting guys on base as

much as we can,” said Roth, who scored '

one of Pitt’s three runs with a solo home
run. “Earlier in the year, it seemed like
every inning we had a chance to score a lot

of runs, and we weren’t doing that [on
Saturday]  Kelly pitched a very strong
game.” _

Panther hurler, Bill Junker, pitched well
while scattering nine hits throughout the
game but could not hold off the persistent
Husky attack which pieced together runs in
five different innings to topple the Panthers.

Pitt’s loss opened the doorfor the
Redmen, who could take the Panther’s spot
in the playoffs with a win over the 5-15
Hoyas.

Despite missing the playoffs for the ninth
straight year, this was a hugely successful
season for the Panthers and Jackson. In
only his third year as Pitt’s head coach,
Jackson has done wonders to turn around a
program that was headed nowhere when
he arrived. /

Jaynes
explains
athletics
overhaul

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

The restructuring of the
Pitt athletic department,
which includes the depar-
ture of four longtime
employees, should be
completed within the
next two months.

“Hopefully, we will
have things in place by
the middle of June
early July, we will have
the people in place, and
we’re going to restructure
some of the areas within
our department that will
allow us to be more pro-
ductive and take better
advantage of the
resources we lhave,”
Athletic, Director Oval
Jaynes said.

The first announcement
of the restructuring came
three weeks ago with the
dismissal of Associate
Director of Athletics Dean
Billick and Assistant
Athletic Director/Business
and Management John
Blanton. Two other offi-
cials in the department
announced their retire-
ment last fall.

“Bobby Lewis is
retiring,” Jaynes said. f‘We
are in the process of hir-
ing a new ticket manager.
Dick Lukehart, who has
been a longtime employ-
ee, is retiring as well.

"We felt like it was the
right time to restructure
and take advantage of
some positions and,.in
essence, phasing out a
couple of positions.”

Jaynes said that while
the rest of the current staff
will be retained, some of
them may be re-assigned.

Panthers ramble and roar tothird place finish at ECACS

By Keith Pompey
For The Pitt News ,

The women’s track team con-
tinued its excellence this past
weekend“ at the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Championships, placing third

out of 50 teams competing in _

the three—day event at George
Mason University. Pitt totaled 64
points, came home with five
NCAA qualifiers and three
school records as well as one
meet record.

For Pitt track coach Steve
Lewis, his team’s weekend per-
formance was nothing short of
awesome.

“Overall, I was pleased with
the third-place finish at ECACS,”

Lewis said. “Since all of the
teams in the Big East are part of
the ECAC, our third-place finish
shows that we rebounded from

.the_sixth—place finish at Big

East.” ‘ .
First—year athlete Najuma

Fletcher led the way for the 4

Panthers, placing third in the
heptathalon with 5,131 points.
She also qualified for NCAA
Championships. Katina Miles
placed fifth with a score of
4,907. A

Fletcher also broke Claressa
Dudley’s school record in the
triple jump with a leap of 40-8
3/4. She placed third in the
event and contributed 17 points
to the team’s total score.

Fellow first-year athlete Tonia

Malloy also fared well over the
weekend. Malloy anchored the
4 x 800-meter relay of Matasha
Van Reil and Mary Caceras to a
fourth-place finish. All four of
the runners ran their fastest
times ever in the event.

In, addition to the relay,
Malloy blazed to a second—place
finish in the 800-meter event.
Her sizzling time of 2:07.31
broke a school record that was
set in 1979, as well as qualified
her for NCAAS.

Also qualifying for NCAAs in
the same event was senior
Ronise Crumpler, who finished
fourth in the 800 with a time of
2:07.61.

As was the case 10-days ago
at the Pitt Invitational, the

ECACs showcased the talent of
Pitt’s young athletes. Other
rookieskwho scored valuable
points for the Panthers were
Van Reil, Allen and Caceras.

For Pitt assistant coach
Keycha Dumas, maturity was
the key for success for this
group of talented newcomers.

“The reason for the success of
these young athletes was
because they had to make a lot

of judgments,” Dumas said.
“They know their responsibili- - D

ties on and off the track which
enables them to live up to Pitt
standards.”

Monica Hockaday, Kim Blair
and Crumpler showed some
spunk asthey combined with
Allen to place third in the 4 x

400 hurdles. "When Blair wasn’t
busy receiving the baton, she
was improving her school
record in the 400 hurdles with
an NCAA qualifying time of
58.76, good for fourth place
overall.

Pitt All-American Allison
Williams once again provided
the highlight of the meet, easily
breaking the meet record in the
100 hurdles with a time of
13.42.

TRACK NOTES: In her
career, Ronise Crumpler has
now qualified for NCAAs in the
200, 400, 800 and 4 x 400 relay.

The Pitt men's team returns to '

action this weekend at the IC4A
championships at William &
Mary.

N o excuses for Pens’ early exit

They were like deadly
machines -— unrelenting,
unyielding and unstoppable.

They had the most dominant
player in the game, Mario
Lemieux, ﬂying along at his
magnificent best. He was sur-
rounded by an electrifying sup-

porting cast,
all backed up
by the rock-
solid play of
goaltender
Tom
Barrasso.

Few thought this team could
be beaten in seven games. Then
reality set in. It was possible

V and defeat became a reality as

David Volek’s overtime shot
dented the net behind Tom
Barrasso and sent the Pens to
the golf courses far too early.

There was no great natural or
unnatural catastrophe derailing
the Pens. .

They just did not play like
the champions that have inhab-
ited the Civic Arena the previ-
ous two seasons.

The first sign of trouble was
Game 1 against the Islanders
when the Pens were on their
heels from the opening faceoff.
The expected Penguin effort
came in Game 2, as Pittsburgh
was in control all the way to a
3-0, victory.

That Penguin squad was a
rare sight inthe series. They
showed up again to plunder the
Islanders in Game 5, but that
was it. Barrasso practically won
Game 3 by himself, but New
York was in control for most of
the series. ,

Game 7 exemplified what
went wrong.

It seemed as if the two teams
switched uniforms and the Pens
played like a team facing insur-
mountable odds.

They made the mistakes that
lose games, the mistakes other
teams had been making all
year.

Huge mistake number one
came when Kevin Stevens took

a run at Richard Pilon about five
minutes into the contest.

They were behind the play,
and it was the kind of stupid,
message—sending hit that hock-
ey outwardly condemns but
condones in practice.

The Penguin all-star bounced
away half-conscious and landed
face-first on the ice. In addition
to the unplanned, self-inﬂicted
nose job, Stevens’ ﬂop cost
Pittsburgh one of its best play-
ers in the biggest game of the
season.

Problem two was beating the
opposing goaltender. Many
times this season, teams came
out ﬂying early only to be

Ryan
Buncher

~ turned away by Barrasso’s solid

fundamentals and lightning-
quick reﬂexes. This time it was
Glen Healy of the Islanders
coming up unbeatable, stop-
ping 19 Penguin shots in the‘
first period alone.

Still, the Pens managed to

9 break through in the second

period and seemed destined to
enter the final stanza with a 1-0
lead.

During a line change, Ulf
Samuelsson found himself
alone behind the net with the
puck. Instead of waiting for
help, he tried to force the puck
up the boards.

Benoit Hoage intercepted and
fired a shot which missed the
net. Steve Thomas took the
rebound off the back boards
and blew it behind Barrasso for
the tying goal.

The Isles added two more in
the third, including a weak goal
that trickled between Barrasso’s
arm and chest into the net. It is
a shot he stops 99 times out of a
100, but not on this night.

The Pens had one more
proud run as time ran out. Ron

Francis, one of the few Pens
who showed any consistency in
the series, figured in on both
goals as a desperate rally gave
Pittsburgh new life in sudden
death.

The Penguins had plenty of
chances, but Healy was still
stellar.

Finally, one overly zealous
Pittsburgh foray lead to what
seemed like the millionth two-
on-one for New York in the
series. Ray Ferraro set off Volek
and the unbeatable machine
had been beaten.

So, should the team be dis-
mantled? ’

Owner Howard Baldwin said
the team would stay together as
long as it won, but now what?

If logic dictates, and it rarely
does, Lemieux holds the
answer.

4 His back seemed to worsen
late in this season. Now he
faces off-season surgery. Before
planning next season, the Pens
need to see if Lemieux will be a
part of it.

If he isn’t, the team needs to
take a new direction. If he is,
there is no reason to believe the
Pens can’t come right back and
win it all next year. _

They may even be able to
improve the team by dumping a
huge salary if Jaromir jagr is the
dumpee.

He regressed this year and,
during the playoffs, he was a

human turnover on skates. The ‘

oft-suggested trade to Quebec

- for center Peter Forsberg never

made more sense.

The truth is that the exact
team that dejectedly, slowly
skated off the ice after game
seven against the Isles is still the
best team in hockey -——- plain
and simple. A

They just need to rediscover
that unrelenting, unyielding,
unstoppable brand of hockey
that brought two Stanley Cups
to Pittsburgh.

NFL spams Pitt alums

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Regardless of the overall
team record, the University
of Pittsburgh has always
proven to be an excellent
training ground for football
players to hone their skills
and move on to the next
level —— the National Football
League.

But the trend came to a
"screeching halt last month at
the.annual NFL draft. Just
one Pitt player —— quarter-
back Alex Van Pelt — was
picked in the eighth round
by the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Why was Pitt only able to
send one player to the NFL
via the draft?

According to Lawson
Mollica, senior offensive
lineman with the Panthers,
there were three factors that
pointed to the cause of Pitt’s
dwindling number of poten-
tial professional players that
were drafted this year by the

NFL. One factor was simply a ,

lack of numbers.

Not only did the Panthers
lose a lot of games this past
season, they lost a lot of
quality player for various
reasons.

Wide receiver Olanda
Truitt, who transferred to
Mississippi State two years
ago, was drafted by the Los
Angeles Raiders in the fifth
round. Barry Threats and
Tyrone Wheatley also left the
team early.

Also, consider the condi-
tion of the team overall com-
ing out of this past season.
This is a team that finished 5-
9 — the worst record in Pitt
football in 20 years (the
Panthers finished '1-10 in
1972).

11

 

“Our record deﬁnitely did
not help the players who had
potential, and [thus] were
overlooked in the NFL draft,”
Mollica said.

A third aspect to the
decline in the number of
Panthers drafted that was
overlooked by most people
is the significance of the fir-
ing of a coaching staff imme-
diately following the season.

“The draft is somewhat
political, and our coaches
were not there at the end of
the season to build up any
players who may have had
NFL potential,” Mollica said.

“It is nobody’s fault, it’s
just something that hap-

pened."

With just one Pitt player
drafted in the eight-round
draft, most ex—Panthers
sought (and found) tempo-

rary employment in the NFL »

via the free-agency route.

Defensive back Vernon
Lewis was one of 12 free
agents signed by the New
England Patriots. _ .

The Jets signed nose tackle
Jeff Esters for pretty much
the same reason.

Kicker Sean Conley signed
with the Detroit Lions and
attended minicamp last
weekend. Another Pitt kick-
er, Scott Kaplan, latched on
with the San Diego Chargers.

While the , opportunity is
there for Kaplan and compa-
ny, the reality of a roster spot
is slim and none.

“John Carney, our kicker
last year, had simply an
incredible year last year, but
he is unsigned,” Chargers
spokesperson Rob Boulware
said. “We consider Kaplan’s
situation somewhat of an
opportunity, but not neces-
sarily a fruitful opportunity.”

T796 Pitt News Inte

By Mike Johns.
Staff Writer

In the ‘70s, the Pittsburgh
Steelers won four Super Bowl
championships. This was due in
part to a defensive unit that

played 60 minutes of bone-

crushing, in—your-face football
—— the likes of which may never
be seen again.

The Steeler defense of that
time will go down in history as
arguably having the greatest
front seven in the history of the
NFL.

In the ‘70s, the Steeler defen-
sive unit was led by a toothless,
undersized, crazed maniac
who, at his middle linebacker
position, had only one mission:
terminate anyone who possess
the football by any means nec-
essary.

In the ‘90s, that mission has
been handed over to outside
linebacker Greg Lloyd. Lloyd is
coming off his second Pro Bowl
appearance, and at age 27, he
could be an All-Pro for many
years to come. At a sculptured
six—foot, two-inch," 225 pounds,
Lloyd is certainly one of the top
outside linebackers in the NFL.

Lloyd is the complete pack-
age at outside linebacker. With
his speed, strength and size, he
sometimes seems unstoppable.
With ,2; 500-pound bench press,

‘ he can mix it up with those 300-

pound linemen, assault that

Intensity personified: Pittsburgh Steelers' linebacker Greg Lloyd on gameday.

and knock a running back out.
In an interview with. The Pitt
News, Lloyd speaks out on such
topics as his rise to stardom
from a small college, what moti-
vates him and the acquisition of

former L.A. Ram star Kevin.

Greene.

The Pitt News: As a sixth-
round draft pick out of Fort
Valley State [Ga.l, did you ever

think that you would be such a
hit in the NFL with two recent
Pro Bowl appearances?

Greg Lloyd? No, coming out
of college I didn’t even think
that I would get the opportunity
to play [in the NFL]. I heard so
much negativity about how
hard it is when you’re from a
small college. My main reason
for going to college was to

receive an education. True, I

was on an athletic scholarship, .

but I never thought that football
would turn out like it has for
me.

PN: Did any Division 1-A"

schools recruit you to play foot-
ball?

When I came -out of high school
most of the schools that were

Greg Lloyd

recruiting me were junior col-
leges.

They were mostly in
California, which was kind of
tempting to me because [I]
wanted to get away from tiny
Fort Valley. Schools like
Georgia or Clemson, which are
right in my “backyard” didn’t
recruit me at all.

It didn’t really bother me that
they Weren’t interested in me.

PN: How is it that a player
who was not recruited by one
single major college football
team become such a superstar
in the NFL’

GL: I was used to having peo-
ple tell me what I [could not]
do. T 0 me, that is like throwing
gas on a fire. I’m the type of
person [that] if someone tells
me I can’t do something, I go
out of my way to get it done.

My main motivation is not
only that I’m making my imme-
diate family proud but the
whole town of Fort Valley.
Every time people talk about
me, they have to mention the
townthat I’m from.

My son, he definitely keeps
me motivated. He has no idea
what his dad does. I ‘mean, he
knows his dad plays football,
but he doesn’t understand the
magnitude of it yet.

He keeps me going. I don’t

‘ want him "to play football, but
GL: No, believe it or not. .

he keeps me focused. 9

THE PI’IT NEWS, Wednesdaz, Max 19, 1993   13

Jaynes
Continued from page 10
There will probably be addi-
tions to the athletic department.

“We’re losing four people out
of our department, and We’re
probably going to add two,”
Jaynes said. A

One of the additions will be
someone that deals with facili-
ties and operations. Pitt recently
revealed plans for an athletic
convocation center.

“We are in the process of
doing some serious study con-
ceining the convocation center
and other areas, and we need
someone to come in to help
with the planning of that as well
as our game—day activities,”
Jaynes said.

Billick said that he had no
idea that the restructuring of the
department was going to hap-
pen. It may have been coming
since Jaynes replaced Ed Bozik
as Pitt’s AD on August 15, 1991.

“Before you make changes,
you need to evaluate things,”
Jaynes said.

“It takes a while'when you
come into a situation, and you .
try to determine what direction
you need to go. I just felt like
we need to concentrate in some
other areas, and I felt the struc-
ture we had prevented us from
doing that.

“We are going to change
some things around within the
department which are going to

A give us more ﬂexibility and do a

better job of accounting the
resources we have.”

game against the Buffalo Bills, you lined
up as the left defensive end.If the Steelers
had a few Pro Bowl-type players on the
defensive line, would it make the defense
greater?

GL: Without a doubt, it is very obvious
to people that we are missing a dominant
defensive lineman. ,

We have some guys that can play, and I
don’t want to knock any of our defensive
lineman. But if we had [a] defensive line-
men that the opposing offense had to
know where that guy was at all times,
what it would do is free up a lot of other
guys.

When I’m playing on first and second
down, teams are worried about where I
am. Then I move on the other side in an
attempt to get free from being double
teamed.

It would be a lot better if we had two or
three guys that the offense always had to
really worry about.

But it falls into “what if?” we had Pro
Bowlers on the defensive line -— what if?

PN: If the Pittsburgh Steelers had three
Pro Bowlers on the defensive line, what
role would you play?

GL: I would probably be the dime line-
backer, the guy in the middle covering
the back out of the backfield. They
wouldn’t need me up front, and then we
could implement a four-man pass-rush.

They would not only have to deal with
the three defensive linemen, but me lin-

ing up anywhere rushing the passer, ,

also. -
You look at how the Eagles’ defense

was when they had Clyde Simmons,

Jerome Brown and Reggie White.

With all that talent, who do you double
team?

No wonder Seth Joyner is able to go to
the Pro Bowl.

Most of the time, it is just him and the
back and he has a clear path, and he
makes the tackle. The offense has to dou-
ble team White or Simmons, and Joyner
can pick his lane and attack right in the
hole.

You would love to have a defensive
line like that, but let’s be realistic -—
you’re dealing with the Pittsburgh
Steelers. Are they going to go out and pay
for players like that?

You ultimately get what you pay for. If
you are going to put a mediocre ballplay-
er out there, then you’re going to get
mediocre play out of them. ,

PN: With the departure of Jerrol
Williams to the San Diego Chargers, do
you think you and Kevin Greene can be a
better combination?

GL: Well that all comes down to timing,
and I’ve known Williams for years. When

you play with guys for that long, they

tend be like brothers to you. You eat with
these guys, you hang out with these guys
and you get to know how they think.

What me and Williams had was our
game plan before the game. Especially on
pass-rushing situations, we would have a
system where as if I would go inside, he
would go outside, and the quarterback
would step up and get crunched.We just
had a feel for the game together on
defense. , '

It is like when Magic [Johnson] would
give a no—look pass to [James] Worthy and
he just knew he would be there for the
easy slam.

Our defense was just starting to gel and
now we have new players in there.
Greene is obviously a good player. His
stats speak for themselves.

But me and Williams were just really at
that point where we just had a rhythm
that worked really well.

In the defense the Rams had, Greene
was used as mostly a pass-rusher. Again,
not taking anything away from his talent
and success. ‘ '

Our defense really isn’t geared to have
a linebacker as strictly a pass-rush guy.
We might get five pass-rush attempts in a
single game. -

PN: Why didn’t they sign Williams
when they paid Greene about the same
amount —— especially when Williams is six
years younger?

GL: Well, if you’re on the outside look-
ing in, it is difficult to say. A lot of people
have asked me this question since it hap-
pened.

The people in the African—American
community ask if it is because Williams is
African American. They say why did they
pay this guy [Greene] $1.7 million when
that is what Williams was asking for. Plus,
Williams is six years younger and just as
talented.

You really don’t want to get into that
and make it seem racially motivated. But
it comes down to two men wanting the
same amount of money with basically the
same talent, but one is six years younger. .

If you were to ask the Steelers if it was
racially motivated, they would say that is
not the case. "P

But again, if you are [looking] from the
outside [the African—American
Community] that is what it looks like.

Baseball

Continued from page 10
The Panthers were a dreadful 8-23 in
1990, the year before Jackson arrived. In

1992, he led the Panthers to their first 1

winning season in over 10 years with a
25-22 record. The speedy, hard-hitting
Panthers ﬁnish the season atop the Big
East in team batting average (.317), dou-
bles (41), runs scored (164) and stolen
bases (65).

Pitt's surprising turnaround has not
gone unnoticed as Coach Jackson is a

' strong candidate for Big East Coach of

the Year.

“I can’t say enough about Coach
Jackson and what he has done for the
program,” Roth said. “We were 8-23 the

year before he came and now we’re 30-
13  the numbers speak for them-
selves.”

The overall talent of this team is cer-
tainly reﬂected in the team records that
the Panthers set this season:

-Most overall wins (30)

-Most conference wins (10)

-Most hits (443)

-Most runs scored (385)

-Most doubles (84)

°Most stolen bases (164)

Panthers Brad Reese and Bryan Henne
also entered the Pitt record books this
season by eclipsing a couple of Panther
all-time records.

Ironman Reese played in all 43 games

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 19, 1993

this year, which gives him a Panther
record of 144 games played over his
four-year Pitt career. Speed demon
Henne stole 12 bases this season, giving
him 46 thefts over his career  another
Pitt record.

Reese’s and center fielder Al Lardo’s
performances in conference play have
earned them all-Big East honors.

But, as Roth put it, perhaps the most
important thing the Panthers gained in
this season of firsts was respect from the
rest of the conference.

“Before this season, nobody in the Big
East respected Pitt. They didn’t celebrate
when they beat us, because it was
expected. This year [Big East teams]

were jumping up and down when they
beat us. This is without a doubt the best
season that Pitt baseball has ever had.
It’s disappointing that we didn’t make
the playoffs, but you can’t judge this sea-
son based on that,” Roth said.

The‘ next hurdle that Jackson will have
to cross is the loss of Roth, Reese, Lardo
and catcher Pat Walsh, who all graduat-
ed this year. The fearsome foursome
provided most of the power for what
was, at one time this year, the nation’s
fifth-ranked offense.

“lThe team] will be fine next year,”
Roth said. “They have a lot of good play-
ers coming back  the pitching staff will
be very strong."
