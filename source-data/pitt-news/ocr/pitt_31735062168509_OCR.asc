Starobin

Discusses Communistic

By HOBART HARRIS

The University was honored
Monday night with an excellent
descrpition of the decentraliza-
tion process of the international
Communist movement in Joseph
R. Starobin’s talk sponsored by
the Seminar on Soviet Studies.

Mr. Starobin was intimately ac-
quainted with his subject through
20 years of party membership
ending in 1954. During this per-
iod he held many important posi-
tions within the American party,
including international editor of
the Daily Worker. He has con-

-tinued his interest in the party

“even though he has cut any for-

mal ties he once hadand is now
a fellow of the Research Institute
on Communist Affairs at Colum-
bia University.

Mr. Starobin took an evolution-
ary approach in examining the
present polycenterism in the
Communist world. He began with
the atmosphere that prevailed in-
ternational socialism in 1917 and
slowly reviewed its progress
down to the present day.

Russia, as the ﬁrst nation in
which the Revolution took place,

 ,«was not looked upon as an iso-
"lated national phenomenon by

xi

\.
'~ 1.

the world's Socialists, but as the

vanguard of the revolutions that s_

would eventually sweep the
world, just as Marx had predict-
ed. The Russians were looked
upon as the elder statesmen of
the movement, and the freedom
of action by ruling Russia led
naturally to the assumption of

. leadership .of _the international

movement, the I ntern atio nal.
Moscow became the center of the

_,Socialist movement “not because
 _. it was the capital of Russia, but

because it was the capital of the
Socialist Revolution.”

However, the international was
not able to continue-‘its interna-
tional characteristics. As early as
1922 Lenin wrote several arti-
cles criticizing the creeping Rus-
sianizatio-n that was going on. Na-
tional parties were forced to bow
to the will of the International

;.sDecentra1ized Process

until the point came that its
word was both Gospel and Law.

Starobin emphasized, however,
that this process was not wholly
the result o-f Russian connivance,
but the natural result of the re
spect that the various national
parties had for the Revolution’s
pioneers and “elder statesmen.”
The submergence of the national
parties was, to a signiﬁcant de-
gree, voluntary.

Starobin tried _to describe the
enthusiasm which this concept
of internationalism, false as it
might have been in terms of Rus-
sian domination, had in terms of
the idealism of the Communists
of the thirties. “There was a "cer-
tain aura, a certain quality of
intense devotion which permeat-
ed the rank and ﬁle,” the peo-
ple believed.

However, Starobin viewed it‘

inevitable that the two great
themes of the Internationa.l—Rus-
sian Chauvenism and the enthu-
siastic idealism of the national
parties would come into conﬂict.
It is this conﬂict that has led to
the breakup of the Communist
monolith. A _

Trouble began to brew in the
late thirties. Starobin. pointed out
that it ‘was during this period
that national parties began to de-
velop real political power within
their own countries. They were
no longer “ideological debating

societies,” but true perveyors of A

“real power and interest,” and
their interests began to diverge
from those of the Russians. If
the Russians had previously’ sent
down an order through the In-
ternational it was obeyed instant-
ly, because there was no real
reason to disobey it—there were
no demonstrable real effects of
the action. But now there were,
and the national parties were
faced with a conﬁict—-obey the
elder statesmen whom they had
trusted and respected for so long,
or do what they thought was
right. The experience was “trau-
matic.” The Tito-Stalin conflict

Questions Literature Policy

By ROBERT ZAVOS

“The. question of distribu-
tion of literature in the
men’s dormitories is not a
political issue,” stated Mah-
mood Mamdani, co-chairman
of the newly formed Ad-Hoc
Committee on Men’s Dormi-
tory Council (MDC) Rules.
“The people who hav_e sign-

- ed our statement in the Pitt

News represent "all aspects

of the political spectrum.”

He said, “Representatives of
groups from the most conserva-
tive sides, such as the Society
for Conservative Studies, to the
most liberal groups, such as Stu-
dents for Peace, have signed our
statement. , Free literature distri-
bution is such a wide-based, legi-.
timate issue that this is the ﬁrst
time such diverse organizations
have gotten together.

Mrs. Kline Becomes

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Mrs. Hibberd Van Buren Kline,
J r., special assistant to the Chan-
cellor as advisor on women’s ed-
ucation, has been honored as a
Distinguished Daughter of Penn-
sylvania.

Mrs. Kline will receive her ci-
tation from Governor William W.
Scranton in Harrisburg October
25 at the 18th annual presenta-
tion of awards to women of Penn-
sylvania "who have distinguished
themselves in different ﬁelds.
Among the recipients of this
honor is’Helen P.«Rush, dean of
student affairs, who was named

one of Pennsylvania's Disting-‘

uished Daughters in 1964.
Comenting on‘ her award, Mrs.
Kline emphasized, ‘I do feel that
in a sense it is a recogniton of
the efforts the University has
made to meet -the needs of a
great segment of our population,
so” in a sense it is an award to the
University." Mrs. Kline reﬂected,
“It is the Ioportunity I have had
at thel/Jniversity to build a pro-
gram.for mature women to com-
plete their education that really
enabled me to get this-award.”
She added that she was “deeply
grateful to the University for the

opportunity I've had here to
serve.”
Mrs. Kline, who was born in

Madison. Wisc., is the sister 
Senator Wayne Morse. She is the

  Distinguished Daughter .

mother ofitwo teen-age sons, and
her husband is chairman of the
geography department at the
University.

She is noted for her lecturing

In 1954-55, the"'Klines lived in
Sierra Leone, West Africa, and,
in 1961, Mrs. Kline was appoint-
ed [special ambassador from the
United States to Sierra Leone
when it celebrated its indepen-

dence.

HEP Begins

Under the leadership of
Earl Trent with Dr. David
Halliday, Dean of the Natur-
al Sciences, serving as ad-
visor, the Hill Educational
Project (HEP) has begun its
conception four years ago.

Dr. Halliday has been a’sup-
porter of .the Project since it
started, first as a tutor and now
as University ‘advisor. Dr. Halli-
day’s personal success in tutor-
ing (a former tutee of Dr. Halli-
day’s is presently attending col-
lege) makes him a valuable ad-
visor, during this period of HEP’s
expansion. ~ I

main center for tutoring is the
Calvary Baptist Church which is
centrally located and accessible
to most children in the" Hill Dis-
trict. The rental of this church
and the hiring of a full-time sec-
retary and janitor has been made
possible by a government grant
through the Office of Economic
Opportunity. The secretary, Miss
Shirley Holmes, has assumed
many of the administrative tasks,
allowing the student leaders time

_ to work more ‘effectively in the

‘community.

There has been a great re-

sponse on the University campus
to the need for tutors, but many

more are in demand. Many extra-

The problem of literature dis-
semination began last year when

the Towers-Quadrangle Commit- . 5
tee was established to deal with 5 L
the problem of literature distri- 
bution ‘in the Towers. During the. — ’”

spring trimester, 1965, male resi-

dents complained that booths 
were too numerous in the Tow- 
ers’ Lobby and that their privacy‘ ‘I
was being violated by people“'~‘  i

derneath the doors of their rooms‘.

A student subcommittee was -- 
formed and it decided that MDC J

alone had the jurisdiction over’-:
men's living areas above the Iob- 
by floor. The distribution to the
rooms was prohibited although.
distribution was allowed in the
lobby. ; 
Thomas Meisner, president of .
MDC, said, “This does not re-
strict free speech. Literature...
could still be distributed in the,

week trial period in which the?
ruling is suspended began ‘last:
week when many groups claimed
that the ruling was restricting;
free speech. ~ 2 p
In explaining the need for‘this ‘
committee, K Mamdanie ‘stated,
“Over the.last 11 months many-
groups including the Pitt Pro?-_‘
gressive Party and many faculty
members have made varied ef ,
forts on this issue, but thereghash
been no attempt to bring these
people together. We are dissatis,
ﬂed with the current four weekfj;
suspension of the rules. If a few
organizations cause disturbances.-
then others may be penalizedL”‘T
Mamdani continual, “Our goal;
is to achieve freedom in litera-
ture distribution in the men’s‘-
dormsillstasitisinthewom
en’s dorms. The main function '6: -
our Ad-Hoc Committee is to 
the grievance clear and bring
into the open. We hope that 
will take this into account at: to-
morrow night's meeting. If not-li
ing is done soon we will conside
taking further action.”  .5

Mamdani mentionedthat 
had originally objected. to the"=
distribution of literature in the 7*
Towers on two points. First, they
were worried about the ‘security
problems that would arise if 
one could walk through the-Tow‘
ers. Secondly, they believed ;t1f‘
rule was an invasion of privacy

On the ﬁrst objection, Mam-.,-_
dani said, “We have stated that.-
persons distributing materia.
should register in the Men’s.—-
Housing Oﬂfice and get a 
which would say what theyfwer‘
doing. On the second point, we be-
lieve that MDC should have jur
isdiction in deciding when or
ganizations are causing" distur
bances and should penalize _.an"’
individual organizations, "accord
ing to rules which we hope ca___
be adopted at the MDC meeting.;?

of 1948 is the classic example‘of
this situation.

The ﬁnal nail in the coffin of
Russian domination occurred in
1956 when Khrushchev began his
attacks on Stalinism. Khruschev
expected this move would
strengthen his hold over the par-
ty, which it might have. But at
the same time it was a brutal ex-
posure of what that greatwhite
hope, Russian Communism, was
really like. The exposures of the
brutaljties of the Great Purge
and the excesses of the Moscow
trials were hideous news to the
communists of other nations, who
had hidden themselves, ostrich-
like, from the obvious. The dis-
enchantment was now complete,
and today's Communist parties
no longer feel any twinges of
emotion when they rise to dis-
agree with the Russians. The
Russian party, once revered as
the father of modern Socialism,
has fallen to a more realistic lev-
el in the minds and affairs of
the international Communist
movement.

Conference

Held Here

~The University of Pittsburgh’s
Graduate School of Business and
the Burea of Business Research
will sponsor the 13th Annual
Pitt Conference on Business Pros-

I pects tomorrow in the Hotel Web-

ster Hall.

“With the current uncertain-

of the most informative,” said
Robert J. A. Pratt, conference
coordinator.

Some 150 people are expected
to attend the conference which
presents _an analysis of the busi-
ness outlook for the coming year.
This year's analysis will be based

‘ The question of dist'ribution of literature in the men's dormitories

this is.not true, it has become painfully obvious that studentleaders and

 This newspaper has long felt that there should be free dissemination

it was felt that the program
could continue on its own
with the usual assistance
from the Student Affairs
staff and faculty advisors.
RECENTLY, I checked
into HEP’s present status
just to see how it was com-
ing along. This fall, when
HEP entered its fourth year,
some 200 Pitt students sign-
ed up as tutors. That is dou-
ble the ﬁrst year's number.
HEP, in coordination with
the Hill House" Association,’
has appealed for and receiv-
ed a federal grant, thus mak-
ing it an official part of the
nation's “war on poverty.”
HEP is now entirely student
run, and its office in the Stu-
dent Union is staffed by a
secretary, paid from the fed-
eral grant, who reports to
the Hill House Association.

I am happy that this sort
of activity is attracting in-
creasing numbers of stu-
dents. The growth of a pro-
gram of this sort is very
heartening. In fact, the pro-
gram may now be ready for
a further step, which. would
shore up its gains.

. Perhaps HEP’s next push
should be in the direction of
obtaining a professional su-
pervisor someone 'who

Dr. David Kurtzman,

Acting Chancellor: '

Speaking for students of the
University, we wish to express
our concern for the future of the
University of Pittsburgh. We urge
immediate action to obtain a
substantial reduction in the fees

paid by our out-of-state students.

If these fees are not reduced, the

future of our University commun-' ‘

tu

toring, in every instance, is
having the effect which it is
capable of having. Such a
trained counselor would in-
sure the quality of the tutor-
ing and would make sure
that the caliber of help the
students are offering is wor-
thy of the organization’s
goals.

AS HEP becomes even
larger, this sort -of guidance
will become even more neces-
sary. ' ti: .

This suggestion is by no
means a criticism of HEP.
Far from it. Growth, how-
ever, has a way of entailing
a lot of responsibilities.
Growth means a lot more
than just getting bigger.‘

So, for those members of
the’. ‘older generation. who

-fail: to notice the construc-

tive contributions of the col-
lege student to our society,
I direct their attention to‘

tions such as HEP. And to

Towers A, B and C. Moreover not one Student Government (SG) Senator
elected on the S.U.R.E. ticket (themajority party in the senate) is sup-
porting the Committee. ’

The student body overwhelmingly selected the S.U.R.E. candidates
as. their senators and executives. If this is such a “wide based legitimate
issue” why are none of these duly elected representatives supporting this
cause. It simply incredulous that this committee can demand change when
it presents such meager support. I

Before any action is taken on bhis~issue, the opinion of the men resi-
dents should be accurately researched. It becomes the responsibility of
M.D.C. to poll the opinions of the" men, asking them whether they want a
temporary suspension, permanent suspension or a return to the original
rules. Certainly the Dormitory Council should wait "until such a poll is
complete and it should not be intimidated by the flarnboyancy of a full“
page advertisement purchased by a handful of students.

Finally tIheUniversity Community should not be swayed by the du-
bious wording of the advertisement into believing thatfreedom of speech
is being repressed on this campus. M.D.C. has given this issue a fair test-
_ing period by-its temporary’ suspension of the rules and is not encroaching
on any of our basic rights. Those who would say this is not the case are
either naive or aiding in the construction of a blatant political campaign.

The Pep Rally \

PERHAPS IT was the Pitt
Foto Club's campaign against
student apathy, or maybe it
was thepmimeographed sheet
distributed by the Student
Union asking: “Are you
Hartless ?” Or perhaps it
was Dave Hart, the best pub-
lic relations lman Pitt has
seen -in decades. Whatever
it was, something stirred
the Pitt student body the
night of the West Virginia
pep-rally. Instead of student
apathy there was almost a
student riot.

For the ﬁrst time in many
years, there were hundreds
of students at the pep rally.
They .weren’t just there in
body, they were there in
spirit. They cvheered and dis-
played school spirit seldom
associated with Pitt. After
the pep rally, the band
marched through the Stu-
dent Union, the Quad, and
the Towers followed all the
way by the students. By the
time the procession reached
Fifth Ave., the spirit was
in high gear. . 

One streetcar got through
the crowd.but that was to be

the last vehicle for a long ’

time. The students —s ﬂowed
into the .street cheering.
They sat in the intersection

and were led in. cheers by.
the Panther and the‘ c'heer- 
leaders. After some time,

tice. We had looked forward to
the meeting as a place for the
airing of ideas in a responsible
situation. However, the respon-
sibility of the leadership of the
Pitt Progressive Union has to be
questioned in the light of the
sudden, and indeﬁnite, postment
of the meeting. Many of us ne-
glected work and cancelled ap-
pointments to attend; it is diffi-
cult to say how many of us will

  Spirit In The Streets

By Tom Streever

the cheerleaders went to the
sidewalk indicating the end
of the pep rally, but the stu-
dents would have none of it.

THEY KEPT blocking one
lane of Fifth Ave. cheering
and chanting. Then a Uni-
versity Police truck came
down the hill and tried to
clear the street by sounding
its siren. That was a mis-
take. It was then that the
cheerleaders should have
stepped in and tried to break
up the crowd, but they stood
on the side and the police

"had their hands full. Where

the cheerleaders interaction’
would probably_have dispers-

ed the students, the _po1ice’s A

action only antagonized
them.

I’m not suggesting that
cheerleaders be trained in
riot control, but students are
more apt to ‘listen to them

a than the police. The climax

came when the students "tried
to overturn the police truck
and almost succeeded. Then
a couple of cheerleaders ran
into the street and, together
with the police, were -able to
break up the crowd.

WE WON the game with
West Virginia. We will meet
Navy this coming Saturday
_and there will be a pep rally
Fr_1day.There’s a good chance

' that there will be more stu-

dents at the Navy pep —rally
than at the one last week
and_ that they will be more
excited than they were last
week. Let me be the last one

The cheerleaders better be

SG Proposes Constitution

In the next few days you stu-
dents of the University will de-
cide whether student involvement
is to become a reality on our
campus. Student involvement is
the creation of a mature, respon-
sible and rational student body
capable of governing itself. It
must be remembered that the
body that now calls itself Student
Government does not now have
the necessary authority either
over students or in influencing
administrative action.

It is up to you students to give
it this authority. It is up to you
to make it a true student govern-
ment.” We the members of the
present Student Government, ex-
press our desire for more effec-
tive tool to communicate the needs
of the student body through this
Constitution. Its effectiveness will
depend solely on your support-—
all your support in the referen-
dum to be held next Tuesday and
Wednesday. Get out and vote pro-
student. Vote for the SG Consti-
tution.

By RAY ROSENSTEIN

Brian Bubnis never expected anything
like this to happen. After three years of
obscurity, he’s suddenly become a celebrity.

‘ Bubnis is the football player who used to be
known for his physique and not for his prowess
on the gridiron. Now opposing linemen are aware
of both. '

“The Terror,” as Bubnis has. always been
known, made one tackle and had nine assists
against California. That performance contributed
to his ecoming the ﬁrst line to earn the Prowling
Panther award. . .

With the emblematic blue star on his hehnet,
Bubnis went out on the ﬁeld against West Vir-
ginia, brought down two ball carriers and had
11' assists. ~

This is the same Bubnis that played only 12
minutes last season and none as a sophomore.

“I never expected to play first string,” says
Bubnis. “Here I was,‘ a senior who had never
played before. Yet the coaches worked as hard
with me as they did with the sophomores.

“I had developedja lot of badlhabits;-over the
last three years and the ~ coaches taught the
right‘ way to play defensive tackle.” _

One of the biggest stigmas _on Bubnis concern-’
ed his lack of speed and more speciﬁcally, his
mobility. “My speed’s a lot better now,” he ex-
plains, “and that's because of the winter program
the coaches instituted. I lost only four pounds
(down to 236) but I know those agility drills
worked.” ‘ E»

Bubnis played a good part of the UCLA open- is my‘?
er but that wasn’t the ideal game to inspire con- ‘ "
fidence. “After UCLA,” he remembers, “I felt may-
be I didn’t belong on defense. In fact, during the
following week I was mover over to offense.

“But towards the end of the week I spoke to

Another Day  
Slippery Rock Batters

Frosh Soccer Players
  By Tom Sacks

Sports Editor

“Into the valley of death rode the six hundred.” Well
the setting wasn’t quite like that which inspired Alfred Lord
Tennyson. The valley was the soccer field of Slippery Rock
College. Nor were there quite 600 people. It was more like
20 skeptical, but eager freshman players. But awesome it
was. .

Soccer is supposed to be a game of finesse and speed,
with just a little bit of muscle applied in the right places.
Slippery Rock must have decided that the game can be a lot
more_enjoyable when simply composed of muscle.

They kicked, charged and charged. Not the ball, but
the players. Some of the frosh called it the roughest game

they had ever been a part, of._ It was one of the most dis- ‘
A gusting. ' '

“When they told us we were going to play Slippery Rock,
I thought it was some type of joke,” said Biff Saunders.
I’m from New Jersey and from the way they’d announce
Slippery Rock football scores I always thought the place
was some type of myth.” '

Last week Biff and his fellow players found out that
Slippery Rock wasn’t a myth. At the end of regulation play,
the score was tied 1-1. The rule book called for two five.-
minute overtime periods, but the Rocket coach decided that
he had seen enough. '

He apologized to George Sommer for the play of his
boys and offered to forfeit the game. Sommer, an All-Amer-
ican at Pitt last year, who has been helping out- Leo Bemis
with the frosh, was a little surprised by .it all; p _-

“It was the ﬁrst time that I had ever experienced some-
thing like that,” said Sommer. “I didn’t accept the forfeit
because I knew we could win in overtime. So the game stood
as a tie.”  '

Two days after the game Sommer had to call off prac-
tice because at least six players were still injured.

“When one of our boys would have the ball, they’d just
run right into him,” added Sommer. “Bob Quinlin’s ankles
are still bruised. Instead of aiming for the ball, they’d aim
for the ankles. Pete Jakobson was even kicked in the shoul-
der, somehow.” ' _ - -

THE TERROR, Brian Bubnis, has learned that physical strength isn’t
the only requirement for playing defense. At Cal he became the
first-Panther lineman to win a blue star, and had an‘ even better

game against West Virginia.

F rosh Wingback Joe McCain Left
QuarterbackAmbitionat Kiski Hig

The quarterback ‘is gener-
ally considered the glory
spot of a football team’s of-
fense, and not many boys turn
down an opportunity to lead a

team’s success. But freshman Joe
McCain did.

Joe was recruited from Kiski
Area High School as a wingback
after starring for two years at
quarterback. In his senior year
he was named to his all-county

.e  

coach Neal and asked him if I could go back to” 
defense, even though I like the offensive line  ’
the way coach Royer taught. 

“He said yes. And I played defense against ‘

Duke.”

-team and to the All Alle-Kiski
Valley team. Yet, he didn’t want
to play quarterback in college.

“I always felt I had a better
shot at wingback, and I always
wanted to play here,” Joe ex-
plained. “I was a wingback in
high school until our quarter-
back was injured.” That occur-
red beforethe ﬁrst game of his
junior year. Kiski was 10-0 be-
hind McCain that season.

Joe was another recruiting plum

Beats Phi Ep 3-2
In Eight Innings

When you get the bases loaded
on one out with the meat of
your batting order up and fail
to score, then maybe you deserve

‘to lose the game. Whether they

deserved to or not, Phi Epsilon
Pi lost the game and the cham-
pionship to Pi Lambda Phi, 3-2,
in eight innings.

The Fraternity A League soft-
ball championship was won on
pitching. There were few out-
standing ﬁelding plays and no
impressive hits. ,Both pitchers,
Shelley Bratman for Pi Lam and
Manny _Golnick for Phi Ep, had
good breaks and bad breaks. Both
had _to get themselves out of
jams. In the end, it was Brat-
man’s superior control
late innings that made the dif-
ference.

Phi Ep scored only in the ﬁrst
inning. Their ﬁrst batter, Eddie

Bench, Prefers ’66" View From Down on Field

From then on it was all downhill for the Ter- 7
ror. “I just hope I can keep it up,” he worries. ff
“The guys all look up to me now.” Quite a switch‘"‘
_ ’ from two seasons of benchwarmning. g

' - Naturally Bubnis’ newly acquired fame has 
sulted in considerable kidding from his 
“They call me E-lite, among other things,” hé
grins. “Birdeye (Dick Miale) Won’t get off 

Bubnis has also found that his hometown of.
Mt. Carmel, Pa., suddenly remembers him. “No
one really knew what I was doing,” he says. ‘fl-
guess they knew I was in co11ege,'but I’ doubtvif’
they knew where Now they even knowllfm still ‘_
playing football.” ' V- ‘

Winning the award has another effect on Bub-f"
nis; He was nervous against the Mountaineers. “-I:
felt like a sophomore out there. But it was a dif-p
ferent kind of nervousness, really. I have respon-
sibility now. 'I'he fellows were counting on m_e.’-’i"

The_ Terror’s whole attitude has changed. He
likes the way things are done now-, he likes the
coaches. “I’m part of this team,” he says. . ,

Bubnis remembers what it was like under
John Michelosen. He remembers that hard-practic-,
ing Mondays and the non-playing Saturdays."
“That’s _why I can’t believe it’s me, after all these.
years,” he" keeps repeating. A ..

This new Bubnis is still developing, still 
ing the ﬁness of his position. Two weeks ago he
stepped into the right defensive tackle spot, won
a blue star, and it will take more than just one‘:

Jones slants off tackle against three West Virginia '
defenders. It was his four-yard end run touch-

strength. Head coach Dave Hart said it in reference to
Mike Raklewicz and Joe Jones. That’s all he has to play the

fullback and ‘tailback positions,
but those “two” give Hart a
deuces-wild combination.

Raklewicz, the number ‘one
fullback and the number two
tailback, upped his rushing aver-
age to 4.7 yards a carry after
gaining 97 yards net in the West
Virginia victory. He has not lost
a yard. ‘

Jones, the number one tailback ‘

and the number two fullback,
averages 3.1 yards per attempt.
He has scored one touchdown
rushing, the big one against the
Mountaineers, and one passing.
Raklewicz has one touchdown.

Meanwhile, Dewey Chester, now
the back-up-man behind Jones,
responded well to treatment and
could play against Navy Satur-
day.

Two lineman, however, stretch-
ed the injury list to seven. Cen-
ter Andy Beamon, who suffered
a head injury Saturday, may be
lost for the season. \Defensive
tackle Tom Mitrakos sustained a
hip injury and is a doubrtful
starter against Navy. Another de-
fensive tackle, John Schmidt, has
been ruled out for the remain-
der of the year because of a
shoulder injury.
