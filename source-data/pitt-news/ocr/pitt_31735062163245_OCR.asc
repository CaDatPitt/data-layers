at the Student Union was like
all the other -fraternity smok-

two years. The. speeches were

_ Parker Enwright, associate
?Dean of Men and Fraternity

‘ go‘ into rush- with an open mind,
forgetting‘ what their fathers,
-older brothers, or friends, had
told’ them about fraternity in

the University, and a member
of almost as many organizations
as Chancellor Litchﬁeld, spoke
on the merits of being a frater-
nity man. ,

He stated that the feeling
of loneliness often,encounter-
ed in living away from home
is alleviated by joining a fra-
ternity which helps build
lasting friendships.

The several hundred rushees
who sat through the speeches,
however, seemed at best unin-
terested in what was‘ being
said. Ten stepped out of the
room in "the middle of the
speech, apparently to get a

 

drink of water or a breath of
fresh air.

Then there were those fresh-
men who strolled in a half hour
after thesmoker began. “How
long has this been going on?”
one boy asked. _

“Too long,” was the an-
swer. I

“What’s been happening?”
another asked.

“Nothing but a lot‘ of
talk,” was’ the reply.

“I thought the whole thing
was pretty boring,” another
said. “Why don’t they just let
us pay our dollar and ﬁnd out

‘boring ‘

about fraternities?”

its ‘fall ﬁlm series with Friday
showings of From 'Here To
Eternity at '7:3(A) and 10:30 p.m.

Stanley Schweiger, Film" Series

demy Awards and major New
York Film Critics’ Awards.

The starring, roles are played
by Burt Lancaster, Deborah
Kerr, Montgomery Clift, a n d
Frank Sinatra. It is based on a
James Jones novel depicting life

Japanese attack. ’

Ad Hoc Committee

To Run

Test Cases   

Evidence‘Sought of Discrimination 

In Immediate Vicinity of Campus

By BERNIE TRUMPOWER .
Someone is going to be baited, according to the plans
of the Ad Hoc ‘Committee on Discrimination for the coming

a school year. According to Irv Garﬁnkel, Ad Hoc Chairman,

the committee plans to run “te_st cases” on. restaurants,"
barber-shops, places of business and housing in the immed-

iate vicinity of the campus to uncover evidence against such v
, places now practicing discrimination. ‘ '

Since late in the Winter Trimester, Ad Hoc has pursued-
the task of shedding light on problems arising from dis-

crimination as displayed by act-6

ual cases on campus. “Contro-
versial articles, letters to the
newspapers, essays_in Mosaic . . .
were responsible for the growth
of the committee.

“After the Forum Series held
a discussion on discrimination,
the committee was formed with
the express purpose of petitioning
the University to take a strong
stand on patronization of private

-clubs that practiced discrimina-

tion,” Garﬁnkel» stated.

Monday Meeting _

Garﬁnkel explained that a
meeting will be held Monday eve-
ning at 8 p.m. in the ' Student
Union to discuss whether the
committee will afﬁliate with the
NAACP, with CORE, remain an
independent organization, or dis-
band: ,

-“In addition, we have urged
the formation of a faculty-stu-
dent committee to accept and
investigate complaints of dis-
crimination,” he added. He also
noted that the committee has
received full cooperation from
the administration, but he is
hopeful that the Chancellor will
soon make, an official statement
regarding the proposed student-
faculty committee. '

According to Garfinkle, the
committee has an interest in the
Hill Education Project, although
it is not associated with HEP di-
rectly. —

In spite of the controversial na-
ture of this committee, Garﬁnkel
has encountered problems with
lack of participation, apprehen-
sion to “accept responsibility,”
and procedures" to follow in order
to correct what problems do exist.

Landed Sororities

In her oratory, Miss Smith ‘laud-
ed sororities as an outlet for sis-
terhood, social activity, social
graces and new cultural ideas. She
stated that many values derived
by Joining a sorority were “in-
tangible.”

“Each sorority seeks diver.

is left up to the individual, and
It IS the girl who puts herself

Comradship A Oﬁered

Gularsen pointed out fraterni-
ties offer true comradship (broth-
erhood) in working toward a
shared goal. Placement service
and ﬁnancial and scholarship aid
are now being made available by
a number of fraternities, he noted.

W P GH Begins Broadcasting
After having transmission delayed by efforts to extend broadcasting to the new men’s

towers, WPGH will begin its third year of bro adcasting this Friday, at, 5 pm. ‘The campus
radio station can be heard by tuning any AM radio to 65(_) on. the dail, 1 according to‘ Jim

Kleinberg, general manager.

This ﬁrst weekend of broadcasting will be kept informal, with a full schedule of
programs coming out next week. This fall WPGH has promised to maintain its high level

of news and music, in addition to:
expanded content in program-
ming. '
I A new series of “Pitt Explores
the World” programs has been
planned. The format will be one-
of discussion in‘ which Political
Science and Economics professors
interview foreign students on
timely issues. In addition, frater-
nity—sorority_ discussions and bask-
etball — a big favorite last year
— will be broadcast. More jazz
and classical music are -also on
the agenda.
Broadcasting Delay

Kleinberg explained that broad-

casting has been delayed till now

organization has been having with
broadcasting into the new men’s

The staff was not ‘supplied
with proper information about
wiring for the dormitories early
enough in the summer to allow
for pre-planning.

Because of the way the towers
are constructed, a co-axial cable,
installed from Schenley Hall to
Bruce Hall for broadcasting to the
women’s dormitories, would have
been~.very expensive and time-
consuming. to install. Had this
method been used, reception in the
men’s dormitories would have
been delayed -until mid-October.

Separate Transmitters Used
To allow for immediate broad-
casting an alternate plan, con-
sisting of ' using separate. transmit-
ters in the A and B Towers, has

there is no transmission into the
C tower.
In the Towers, _WPGH will
have the clearest "reception on
the dial, as the construction of
the dormitories will cause re-r

broadcasting line to the Nurses’

To Do The Mastﬁoatl  I

Well, the Ad Hoc Committee on Discrimination "is once,‘
again setting forth on its crusade for racial equality in

Oakland after a summer of planning and no activity worth .

rioting. . , _
Like most organizations formed in a heat of passion, the
group ﬁrst sought recognition and acceptance through their

" moderately successful petition campaign and then -sat down
to try and ﬁgure out just what it was that the committee

was supposed to represent and what it was supposed to

' accomplish.

As ﬁrst, the group’s wrath was directed at the students
who turn up their noses at mixed dating, and — in a less

‘outward manner — -at the alleged practices of theitwelfth
ﬂoor. .

_ Unfortunately, all their eﬁorts went for naught, for
there was either nothing for them to ﬁnd or no way of
proving what they did discover; Ofcourse, they did make-
the campus rather discrimination conscious, but whether

i ' bringing the problem to the front accomplished something’

of importance is quite another matter. A

 With a trace of common sense, they subsequently left
the campus discrimination problem. to fester for a while
iintil a more opportune time for action, and are now con-
centrating their eﬁorts at the score of businesses in the Oak-
land area which most probably do practice discrimination

A in one form or another.

, The question is now, however, whether the Committee
has stepped beyond its ‘bounds and is. trying to stir up
trouble in an area which could be better -handled by the
city’s council on discrimination. ,

I If there is a problem in "Oakland outside the campus,

4 would it not be better for them to turn itzover to the city

and let them clear it up? The Ad Hoc Committee is form-
ing a sort of Anti-Discrimination vigilante_ band who will
most probably ﬁnd little and create many hard feelings in
the area.

i There is a job to be done in Oakland, but the Committee
is not really qualiﬁed to handle it, and it is a job which
must be placed in qualiﬁed hands. _

Far more could be accomplished by the Committee’ if
they would align themselves with the Hill Project and
concentrate upon helping the oppressed rather than at-
tacking the oppressors. _ _ _

There is not as much glory in assisting a young Negro
with his English as there is in exposing a barber-shop which
will not cut his hair, but it is certainly a greater and more
lasting accomplishment.

’ ‘ Foreign Aid

‘The foreign aid bill is again in its annual

struggle for existence. Despite reorganization and
change in administrative leadership, foreign as-
sistance is still not receiving the support that it
should. There ‘are a number of
reasons why our aid program
lacks public and congressional
support, and a number of ways
this support can be built.

The process of foreign as-
sistance is only ‘vaguely under-
stood, at best, by most Ameri-
cans. While working this sum-
mer for the Information Ofﬁce
of the Agency for International‘

a suggestion typical of those

from people who criticize the program without
any real knowledge of its basic operations. This
suggestion concluded that since there was so
much waste and graft in the program, perhaps we
should send a guard along with the sacks of

_money so our aid dollars would reach their des-

tination unharmed. This “sacks of money” con-
cept of the aid program extends into our press
and Congress. The American people often have
this picture of sacks of shiny coins and rolls of
greenbacksi being loaded into _a huge freighter at
New York’s ' docks and shipped off for exotic,
unfriendly shores. — - - '

Money Spent Here .

In fact, only" about one-ﬁfth to one-third of
the AID. appropriation leaves the shores of the
United States. The money is spent in "this country
for contracts to U. S. businesses, colleges (the
University among them), and- research institu-
tions. The _money that doesgo abroad is usually
geared to speciﬁc projects and programs, such as
a dam,"factory, or highway. ' _ ‘

A more complex misconception is that ‘of re-
sults. Year after year goes by without a shelving
in the aid request. The underdeveloped nations
seem to make only slight moves towards modern,
democratic societies. In" many areas of the world,
notably India and Latin ‘America, population is
exploding at such a rate that foreign aid is vir-
tually swallowed upibefore it can have any effect,

in coming. The process is inﬁnitely more difﬁcult
than that of the Marshall Plan, which was really
a massive infusion of capital into Europe. The
job that AID .is trying to do today requires
decades —-— this is the simple truth —— and Ameri-
cans are short on this kind of patience.

The real question is ‘gaining enough support
for the program.to make ita continuous opera-
tion. Only a program that is well-run, clearly
presented to the American public, and realistic in
evaluation of its goals can gain this necessary
support. ’ . ,

Known for Administrative Skill _

The Administrator of AID, former budget di-
rector David Bell, is known for his administrative
skills. He is tough with his assistants, demanding
of the people in the ﬁeld, and a tireless worker.
He has worked diligently to pare excesses from
the AID program. He has beenhard-nosed with
countries receiving aid —- Ceylon in particular;
and his discipline and energy are being felt in
the agency with good effects. n

AID’s presentation ' to the public is severely
hampered by the aftermath of the famous Dvorak
Amendment, which forbade AID’s predecessor,
ICA, from publicizing the activities of the agency.
The stigma of this amendment, which in effect
eliminated a public affairs ‘office from the Agency

for‘ ﬁve years, .lives on in the timidity of, thg L

agency’s information staff's operations. Gradually,
the agency is telling more and more of _its story
to the public. . '

Finally, the agency is going through a thor-
ough examination of its goals in each recipient
country. More than ever foreign aid is being tied
to our foreign A policy, -with frank appraisals of
each recipient’s abilities and needs. .More and
more the beneﬁciaries of aid are required to ini-
tiate self-help reforms before aid will be granted.

The European countries, as members of the De-.
are . .

velopment Assistance Committee (DAC)
being asked ‘to give more in line with their new
wealth.»

The aim of Bell and his associates is to make

_ the AID program tight, understood, and realistic.

Though well on their way to this goal, their sin-
cerity and ability may not be enough to gain sup-
port from a skeptical Congress and -an unin-
formed or misinformed public.

a Liberal

Each year this institution is the recipient of
one grand responsibility. To educate. — give a
liberal education -—-‘to -a throng of new arrivals,

‘ each bearing a fresh student number to replace

the traditional beanie. Or is‘
Is it
really the duty-of the institu-

tion of education.

Wilksbarro, Ohio, it means that.

acquire some practical skill
during this process. Maybe she
will ﬁnd time to get a degree

 

in sculptering.

To Grandmother Wilkinson, chairman of cul-
tural diversions for -the Women's Christian Tem-
perance Union, it means acquiring a liberal view
of the world vandithose people in it. Just so it is
not. too liberal. This of course means visitingnthe
Lutheran Church -once or ‘twice — not so‘ often
though as to become swayed in the 'beliefs.“your
family has always found suﬁficient to weather
them through any crisis.” _

To the student's father it means getting some-
thing more than he had as a boy. This rather
loose deﬁnition may be twisted by themore ad-
venturousstudent to include draft beer and frol-
icking maidens without nylons.

Getting Along "Alone"

To the other member of concern, affectionately
known as “Mom,” it means her son must learn
how to get along on his own. This means mailing
home laundry,.saving ﬁve dollars a week out of
every ﬁfteen from home, and possibly joining the
Chapel Choir . . . or Hillel. Yes, there is one
more member to please . . . the Comptroller . . .
but he can be bought off.

The sense of all this? Each student . . . in
many cases upperclassmen . . . mustdecide what
it is that he will derive from this institution, not
what this institution will give him. It is the re-

sponsibility of the institution to see that there -

Meter Installation

Due Within Month

Contrary to the hopes of stu-
dent “dreamers” who are unex-
pectedly still parking free of
charge in the campus "area, the
City has not forgotten the‘ park-
ing meters intended for Oakland.

Construction. plans for the
meters are being drawn up now,
according to Anthony Miscimarra,
Pittsburgh traffic-planning engi-

Delay in installment of the
parking meters, which were to
have been in operation by
August, was due to a shortage of
city manpower, Miscimarra re-V -
vealed.

“Because of vacation, we didn’t
have any men to spare,” he ex-
plained.

Instead of undertaking the pro-
ject itself, the City has now de-

construction to b egin within a

Offensive Team Shinesgs
As Gridders Display
-New Wide-Open Attack A

By AL BLUMKIN

Improving" the offensive. attack has been one of ‘the
prime concerns of football coach John Michelosen as the
Panthers prepare to open the 1963 season at UCLA a
week from Friday, . -

The gridders held a two-hour scrimmage at the
Stadium Saturday afternoon which -concentrated mostly
on offensive patterns. Michelosen showed an open offense, using
the talents of Paul Martha, Fred Mazurek, and Rick Leeson’ to
their fullest extent.

The ﬁrst three "teams scrimmaged mainly against the fourth '
and ﬁfth-stringers, who used UCLA defensive formations. The
first two teams moved through the "defense almost at will, with
Martha, Mazurek, Leeson and Bill‘ ‘Bodle impressing“.

- ' . ‘- Use Double-Reverse A _ ,_

According to backﬁeld coach Bimbo Cecconi,_ the -oﬁense
“was using all the plays to see which function best”. Michelosen
unveiled a wide-open oﬁense with reverses, double reverses,’
options, and sweeps. The Panthers also used the quarterback
eligible, pass which sprang Mazurek and Frank Novak into the -4,,-
clear as receivers. _ ‘D

One of the biggest surprises in the offensive platoon has

been the emergence of Bodle as starting right halfback. Bodle,
who ran behind Martha last year, beat out the much-herald-

ed Eric Crabtree for a starting berth. He has shown speed,
power, and desire. ' -

The line play was equally impressive, despite the temporary
loss oflthree starters. Center Paul Cercel, guard Ed Adamchik,
and tackle John Maczpzak, in particular, hit hard, and opened
many holes for the backs to scamper through. ‘ -if

A Long Hurts Knee

Three injuries were suﬂered during the scrimmage. ‘Bob
Long, starting right end, suifered the most serious injury, a strain-
ed ligament on theright knee. His knee is badly swollen, and he
will be out indefinitely. Joe Kuzneski will’ replace Long. Starting
left guard Ray Popp pulled a hamstring muscle in his leg and
will be out a few days, ‘while halfback Dale Stewart suffered a —v
head injury. '

A key lineman, tackle'~Ernie Borghetti, did not participate .’~
in -the scrimmage. He tore a ligament in practice earlier, and "
watched the play from the sidelines. The 242-pound senior
is _optimistic, however, and expects to be ready for the open-
ing kickoff Sept. 20. '

4 Fran Novak’s destiny at Pitt seems to be that of a sub-

Novak accepts his ‘position on the football team. “It’s

said. “I;think he’s one of the best¢ A

grade. He stated, “My dad used to
bet a good‘ kicker. I would hear
people commenting about it and
so I decided to give it a try. Now
I practice all year round.”
Football is not Clark’s only
interest. While in high school he
also made the area all star base-
ball team. His baseball future
however is uncertain.
“I like baseball,”
“but football is still my major
concern. I feel that "it offers me
my best chance at success. I’ll
have to wait and see how my
grades come_.out before _I decide

j what to do this spring.”

Coach Bill Kaliden can not re-
call any --other player having
made the varsity strictly on the

he stated, I

seems to have built up a reputa-

here yet.”
Lettered on Defense

Although Novak has not prov-
ed himself offensively, he expects
to see a lot of action on defense.

é He lettered last season, although

he was only in for two offensive
plays.

“Fran is "needed on defense,”
Cecconi said. “He’ll get a shot at
that position. Glenn Lehner is
probably‘ a little bit better, but
he’s been around a little long-.
er.”

.vNovak has apparently matured
smce-his pre—college days when he
reportedly said that he wouldn’t
come here unless he could be a
starter. “He’s a good kid,” Cec-
coni said. “He acceptswhat goes
on. He realizes Mazurek’s abili-
ties, but he still works hard.

“A boy like that is very valu-
able,” Cecconi said. “He knows he
has to be ready at all times. He
WOI‘kS E15 hard now as he ever
did.”

“He might not like being a sub-
stitute, but he hasn’t showed any
outward signs. That’s a great

.quality,” Cecconi said. “He’s con-

ﬁdent his day will come, I imag-
ine.” ~ V _

“It’s hard to saytnow whether
Novak will be on the second or
third string,” Cecconi said.

Harriers Face
Top Eastern
College Teams

This season coach Carl. Reese’s
cross—country team faces a tough
six-meet scheduleagainst some of

‘the best squads in eastern col-

legiate competition. Among the
seven teams they oppose, are three
conference champions and two
teams which placed in the top ten
of the CYA meet: V

The ﬁrst meet is .away with
Slippery Rock, one of the best
small college teams in the nation,
Sept. 21. Last year the Panthers
defeated the Rockets, 23-33, in
what later proved to be the best
performance of the team for the
entire season.

Following will be away meets
with Ohio U. and Kent State, Sept.
28. Navy, Oct. 5, and Penn State,
Oct. 12. Then they ﬁnish up with
home meets with Ohio State, Oct.
19, and West’ Virginia, Nov. 9.

Rees feels that with six letter-
men returning the team is in a
good position to improve on last
year’s 2-5 record, “only if ev-
eryone canlive up to their po-

ﬁtential and to ’past perform- ’

ances.”

. According to Rees, Steve Waslo
has recovered from a body infec-
tion that was responsible for his
poor performance last season. In
referenée to this infection Rees
said, “The doctor stated that it
was a_miracle that a man in

Steve’s condition could run at all.” ,

As a sophomore in 1961, Waslo
ran one -of the fastest times in
Schenley Park history, 22:27, and

will play a key role in thesuccess

of this season.

Squash, Rifle ‘Dropped. from Panther C
Collegiate Schedule; Future Cloudy , 

Geographical location has
caused the University to drop
squash from its varsity" program.
Athletic director Frank Carver
said, “We are probably the only
varsity squash team west’ of the
Alleghenies. '

“The sport will be suspended
until we can schedule some home
and home meets. We are will-
ing to go to other schools, but
they say it is too expensive to

" come to us. Also, it is not fair

that the boys who play only four
squash matches get a letter just

like players who participate in
ten. football games or track
meets.” —

Beside squash, riﬂe has also
been dropped, but for a different
reason. Carver states, “Riﬂe has
been suspended. until 1965 when

we will get ,a new range. Right;

now there
distance.
again in the 1966 season.”

is no range within

While. riﬂe has . an immediate .

future, Carver was not optimis-
tic about squash. With only 1
fewneighboring schools that play

squash, it seems as if the game

has disappeared from the local
collegiate scene.‘ i
