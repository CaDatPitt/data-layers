Chi Rho’ Nu, men’s local honorary
pre-medical fraternity, announces
that sixteen ofuts 1939 members
have entered various medical schools
throughout eastern United States
this fall, I -

Of this number seven students
were second year men, four were
third year men, and four were_ sen-
iors. This is a. most extraordinary
record, as many graduates have
complained of the extreme difficul-
ty of entering local medical schools,
according to Lawrence C. Bachman,
Col. ’30, past president of the fra-
ternity and now1 enrolled in the
University medical school. ' 1

The newly elected officers of the
fraternity include Frederick Mugele,
Col. '31, president; John Stubbs,
Col. '32, vice president; William
Edwards, Col. ’32, secretary, and
Charles Banhert, Col. ’32, treasurer.

According to Mugele the p1'08l'8-m
for the coming semester includes

1 the annual inspection of the medical
school, attendance at a number Of
clinics, visits to Mayview» Westem
Penitentiary and Dixmont, lectures
by various doctors and the annual

Revises

The Point Scale committee for
men’s extra-curricular activities,'.
after a month's effort to restrict all
men to 10 activity points, toolc,ad-
ditional remedial steps at a special
meeting held this week.

Following the system employed by
the office of the dean of women, the
committee has ordered that no stu-
dent may officially accept a. position
in any campus organization or ac-
tivity unless his’ eligibility is ap-
proved by the committee. The pro-
cedure is .to become effective at
once. .

According to Theodore W. Biddle,
assistant to the dean of men «and
secretary of" the committee, this ac-
tion was taken in an attempt to pre-
vent the recurrence of the embar-
rassing situation whereby seven stu-
dents‘ were recently asked to relin-
quish several‘ of their activities‘ in‘
order to conform with the regula-
tion placing the activity points at 8
maximum of ten. The students all

resigned certain positions‘ after they
had made tentative plans for the
year's program.

A Other qualiﬁcations which a stu-
dent must meet before accepting ad-
ditional activity positions is the reg-
ulatiou calling for the assage of
twelve credits in the previous semes-
.ter.

‘ Members’ of the committee
stressed the fact that they were in
no way seeking to control the per-
sonnel of the various activities, but
were concerned only in seeing that
students participating in them met
‘with all eligibility requirements.

Those serving on this committee
"clude Dean Robert C. Clothier,

‘J‘ewisbL’ ‘House; A  .To
Newcomers’ Intrusion

Objecting to the petition. of a
_group of Pittstudents interested in
organizing a local _Jewi,_sh fraternit -
at the University, all other Jewis
frateriiities on the Pitt campus have
submitted‘ a_ counter-petition to the:
Dean of Men._ The tition which is
-signed  presidents of Sigma
A pha _.Mu,1..»Phiv E silon, Pi. ,K8-PPS"
Nu. Pi Lambda? ' and Phi Beta
Delta, states that-_ there is insuffi-
cient fraternity, material among
Jewish students enrolled at Pitt for
a sixth fl-ateriialzgroup.  .

Other objections to. the formation-
of the. new group as set’ forth in
the counter petltlpn ‘include1’the. ar-
ments that the calibre,-andqual-1
ity of the Pitt_ -Jewish fi-ate"rnitic‘s"
would necessarily be lowered be-
cause ”of the heavy competition that
Would result with the addition. of a
sixth fraternity.

Although. the Fraternity commit-
tee, headed by Dean” Robert C. Clo-
thier, has given tentative. approval
to the group proposing establish-
ment of the local, provided the or-
ganization be‘ consummated during
the present school year and that the
constitution and by-laws of the
grou «be submitted. to'the commit-
tee or approval, a reconsideration
of the matter in. the light of the
counter-petition will be given by the
committee. according to Theodore
Biddle, secretary. “ ‘ ’

_The P¢t1t1on for the new frater-
mt)’ Was presented to die committee
by a grou led» by Lawrence Spie-
gelzlass, ent. '32. He intimated
that the local would probably» affili-
ate with a strong national Jewish;
fraternity shortly. after its estab-'
lishment on the Pitt campus. ‘

Records in the office of the dean

Open Debate
Season Soon

Male Debaters S c 11 e d ii I e
Meet For November 24

 

 

The Men’s Debating Association
will formally open its activities for
the season 1930-1931 with an exten-
sion debate at Allegheny High
School, Monday evening,’ November
24, it was announced this week by
Edward T. Crowder Jr., student de-
bate manager.

The question that will be argued
by the debaters at this first public
meeting is, “Resolved: That _the
several states should enact legisla-
tion providing for compulsory un-
employment insurance.” This ques-
tion has been selected by the squad

to replace the question, “Resolved:

That the tendency to consolidate re-
tail business in chain stores is to
be deplored," because of the imme-
diate intense public interest aroused
in the former b the forthcoming
elections, in which unemployment
insurance is one of the major is-
sues.

The popularity of the unemploy-
ment question is also evidenced by
the fact that ithas been selected
for debate by the Mid-West Confer-
ence, stated Crowder, concerning
the change in topics.

The first of two scheduled trial
debates for squad members was held

esterday in Room 217, Alumni

all, with the question, “Resolved:
That the Eighteenth Amendment
should be repealed and the control
of the liquor traffic left to the sev-
eral states,” the topic of debate. The
argument for the affirmative was
presented b Robert J. McClurkin,
Col. '31, an Cyril Jacobs, Bus. Ad.
'32, while the negative was defended
by Edward T. Crowder J1-., Col. '31,
and C. J. Milroth, Col. '31.

Trial Debate

The second trial debate is sched-
uled for November 6, with L. J. But-
ler, Col. '32, and Jess Spirer, Col.
'31 on the affirmative side, and Sam
Strauss, Col. '31, and Emanuel Fish-
kin, Col. '81, pressing the negative.
The object of the trial debate: is
to give all the debaters a thorough
knowledge of the questions to be
used throughout the year.

Professor W. M. Parrish, men's
debate coach, also announced that
there would be further tryouts in
about four weeks for any men who
would like to become members of
the Debating Association. However,
any who care to try out before that
time ma do ‘so by arranging con-
venient interviews, by appointment,
with Professor Parrish.

By ELAINE FORAKER

Question: What’s the best way to
get acquainted at Pitt?

Answer: Have an older sister?

Simple formula, isn't it? Quite
a few freshmen have tried it this
year, too-—-thirty-seven of them, in
fact. Includin a junior who trans-
ferred this fa. 1, there are thirty-
eight women who have sisters who
have gone to Pitt. Eighteen of
them have sisters who are in school
now, and ten have sisters who grad-
uated in 1929.

How do they feel about having a
big sister—-especially those who are
in school now? “It’s a big advan-
tage," they agreed, except for one
cynic who observed that she “hadn't
seen any advantage as yet,” and an-
other radical who ﬂatly stated,
“There’s no advantage to it.” _

Several qualiﬁed their enthusiasm
by adding, “It's a disadvantage if
your sister has made good and.you
have to live up to her reputation.”
. However, this is offset by the
fact speciﬁed by- one freshman thus:
“An older sister paves the way;
gives you the low down on the way
things are run, and tells you all the
ins and outs of the school.”

Eight‘ others ampliﬁed their re ly
in the affirmative by saying t at
they got to know more people, and
made more friends through their
sisters.

There was a great deal of dis-
agreement as to whether they came
to Pitt because their older sister
did. The majority voted “yes," but
a strong minority denied it.

But they must have had some rea-
son for coming to Pitt. Well—“I
didn't want to go away”--“I knew
so many people at Pitt”-—-“I had a
scholarship” explained two women
-—"I wanted a higher education,”
observed two others.

Will they follow ‘in their sisters’
footsteps? “I should say not,” they
chorus. And evidence seems to
prove that they are right. Eleven
of them are registered in a different
school than their sisters, and only
seven in the same school.

When it comes to majors, there
is an even greater difference. Only
three are majoring in the same sub-
'ect, three are undecided, and’ twelve

most popular are Spanish, French,
Physical Education and Library
work. ,

It seems to be an unwritten law

The Council of Presidents of
Women's fraternities has published
its programs for the coming year
of 1930-31. The next meeting will

‘Q

Among 37 Fresh Coeds

that if a woman goes out for de-
bating, her sister will be a sports
enthusiast. Or if she is a glee club
soloist, her sister sets out deter-
minedly for the Owl office. Thir-
teen freshmen are active in organ-
izations different than their sisters,
while only three followed the same
activity interests. W. A. A. led as
the greatest interest, closely fol-
lowed by Pitt Players, the Owl, and
Y. W. C. A. One sister proved to
be an individualist, trying out for
the Panther.

Sisters may have the same en-
vironment, according to ps chole-
gists, but they certainly dont have
the same hobbies. Reading, as the
most popular one, has ﬁve adher-
ents, other favorites b,eing dancing
and sports. One freshman con-
fessed to tackling difficult. math
problems as her hobby, with mys-
tery stories as a sideline. Movies,
and even sewing, came in for their
share of interest.

But none of these seem to belong
in the same family, or at ‘least in
eleven cases. Five sisters admitted
that they shared hobbies as well as
clothes, one pair even co-operating
on a mutual stamp collection.

When they graduate, six fresh-
men will go into the same vocation
as their sisters, nine will go into
different fields, while four are un-
decided. As you would expect,
there are more prospective teachers
than any others. Two are prepar-
ing to become personnel workers,
and two for librarians. Still an-
other is planning to be a doctor.

Although these sisters are so dif-
ferent inside, they are remarkably
alike outside. When you are sitting
on the bench on the landlng,- see if
you can pick out these big-and-lib
tle-sister combinations:

Martha Beach-Margaret Beach;
Martha Boyle-Aimee Jan Boyle;
Eleanor Brankstone - Mary Jane
Brankstone; Marina Butera-Rose

Lowma‘n‘Latta, head of the inves-
tigations committee, reported that
the thirty-ﬁve cent charge that is
being perpetrated upon car owners
at football games was the action‘ of
a group of young boys living in the
neighborhood and not connected
with the University. The adminis-
tration is doing all in its power to
so press the practice. .
potential ' investigations were‘
suggested by Charles Seidle, Col.
'31. The first was the likelihood of
a co-operative book store atthe
University, where students could
receive books at cost rice, and at
the. same time be ab e to dispose
of used books at a reasonable price.
The second suggestion concerned
the -availability of meeting places
for small committees. Both sugges-
tions were accepted by the inves-
tigations committee with a promise
of investigating the matters.

A Mentor Speaks To
Freshmen

By MARGARET HALL
President 01 W‘. S. G. A.

Mentorship as a station is
sliding down the tracks —our
Freshman train is fast drawing
near to_ the land of its own or-
ganization.

From now on, Freshmen will
stand on their own feet. But
they will be backed by certain
deﬁnite things which they have
acquired during the period of
mentorship.

We mentors hope that our
Freshmen have acquired an
academic standing and adapta-
bility Vliich will function for
them throughout the years —
we hope that they have ac-
quired enough contact with ad-
ministration and faculty, to ap-
preciate and sympathize with
them.

But above all, we hope that
you will have made friends,
friends with people and books
and places, all of them vital,
and all within your reach.

Pitt Studes May See
Chicago Racket Girl

Pitt students who like «good
movies should go to see “The
Widow from Chicago" new current
at the Enright in East Liberty. The
story is about a girl who actually
demoralizes various gangsters and
racketeers of the Windy City.

On the stage Dick Powell pre-
sents “Cheer Up," a peppy revue
with the lovely screen star, Olive
Borden. Johnny Mitchell, who re-
ceived such an enthusiastic recep-

tion on his return to the organ last 9

week, is presenting another of his
popular logues.

Neil Hamilton, star of “The Dawn
Patrol,” is featured in the picture
with other ﬁlm notables. .

B7 LEONARD MENDLOWITZ

D9lVing' deep into the past of Dr.
James K. Stinchcomb, we, inquisi-
tive and always prying into some-
one else’s private business, found
out that he had been an actor in
a play called “Human Hearts,” way
back in 1922.
Stinchcomb with this accusation,
we ﬁnally made him relent, and tell
us details of his interesting career,

“Yes,” observed Dr. Stinchcomb,
“immediately after the World War,
I pla ed with a roadshow company
of “ uman Hearts” for nineteen
weeks. I portrayed the villain, who
was always threatening the hero
and heroine. The heroine refused
to marry me; and so I killed her,
which foul deed ended in in own
downfall, amid the cheers of an-
dience. We travelled from Cincin-
nati to Kansas City, by way of Ten-
nessee, Arkansas and Missouri. The
troupe disbanded in Kansas City and
so ended my professional career.”

Stage People

“Stage people are the most in-
teresting people in the world. They
furnish the most valuable associa-
tions to anyone interested in human
psychology. These people were tal-
ented, but thwarted in their desires
to attain real success; they were ex-
tremely conscientious, and always
expecting a ‘break’ that would es-
tablish them, both ﬁnancially and
artistically. The manager was a
positive genius in theatrical affairs
—wl_ien he was sober. He taught
me Just about all I know about the
Stage. and its techniques." _

Dr. Stinchcomb deserted the foot-
lights and grease paint for the more
digniﬁed position as a high school
Latin teacher. After teaching four
years in Kentucky and Ohio, he
came to McKeesport High School.
Of course, we have to menti-on this,
because we, too, went to McKees-
_ort High, years and years ago. We
Ike to reminisce because Professor

Stinchcomb taught us all about Cae- _

sar’s Gallic Wars.
Big Hit
McKeesport Hi II was putting its
annual musical sliow on, and Pro-
fessor Stinchcomb was called upon

to supervise, _its production. He
made a big "hit"'out of that year’:
play, an adaptation of Bizets fg-
mous operetta, -“Carmen.” He
started Joseph Levine, who ,1“.
ated from Pitt last year, on his way
selecting him for
the important ro e of Escamillio, the
toreador. _

From McKeesport, Stinchcomb
came to Pitt, where he earned his
Ph.D., but he's still the same polite,

charming gentleman he used to be-

back in McKeesport. He married
last Thanksgiving and tells us ‘he’;
still happy. Encouraging, isn't it‘!

Dr. Stinchcomb returned to ’~the
SD-8e two years ago, in the Y. M.
& Y. W. H. A. Playhouse presenta-
tion of “The Queen's Husband.”
“The stage still held its attraction
for me,” admitted Stinchcomb, “but
teaching still held a greater attrac-
ti0r_i._ shall never return to the
legitimate theatre.”

Sugce coming to Pitt, Stinchcomb
hasnt had much time to devote to
his first love, excluding “The
Queen's Husband" venture, but he
is an active member of the Moose
Telnple Amateur Organization,
which concerns itself with Dl‘oblAI;\_g
concerning the staging and‘ pmduc-
ing of shows.

Greek Drama

Dr. Stinchcomb has translated the 2 DP}
Greek tragedy, “Merope,” from the . .

‘ancient Greek, and adapted it for

stage purposes, This play will be
produced Sunday, November 2, in
the Enright theatre in East Liberty.
The funds, derived from the produc-
ing of “Merope,” will be used to es.
tablish a Greek Room in the Cathe-
dral of Learning. “Merope” in case
you are interested is thename of
the heroine. John Antono ulos,
Bus. Ad. '31, is the only Pi t stu-
dent in the cast. With Stinchcomb's
staging, and Antonopoulos’ per-
formance, “Merope” should be a big‘
“hit."

It is a far cry from a ‘stage actor
to a college professor, and yet Dr.
Stinchcomb, has bridged the gap
successfully. With such versatility,

how could any m-an fail to be an
outstanding success ?.

sented “A Century of Transporta-
tion.” He pictured the pioneer days

lined the history of governmental

scribed the operation of railroads

out the need for s eed i_n distribu-
tion which has deve oped in the past
decade since the war.

On Tuesday, he related a human
interest story, The Life of Edward
H. Harriman. Mr. Fitzgerald. was
a’ personal friend of Mr. Harriman,
and could well tell of the contribu-
tions of this empire builder to the
development of the_West in the r_e-
creation of the Union Paciﬁc Rail-
road. _ “

istration group, he presented the
life of James J. Hill, the greatest
contributor to the development of
modern railroads.

l Social Program

An interesting social program was
planned for Mr. Fitzgerald by the
school of Business Administration.

cent W. Lanfear at the Chamber of

All the world’s a stage to some
poor deluded souls but to us it's just
one big football field and a blowing
of the nose. Get it‘! Anyway, since
we’re not football conscious, we’ll
still have to give you the dirty side
of life and look for the important
side on the sporting page and in
Sunny’s column.

_.Q.._..

We just came back from a small
ride and saw a coal truck turn over
in front of the Delt house. All the
Delts were out with their little pick
and shovels picking coal. Bill Gray
picked up the biggest lumps so he
gets to sit on the registers longest
when winter comes. . . .

Something sad about Fred Lucas.
Fred sinks in the chest and it's all
because he's been a drummer for
seven years. It seems that we never
can pick out the musical types in
this weekly office . . . And three of
our old pals that you all remember
made Med School after two years
of pre-Med. They are Johnny Pow-
ell, Clark T. Rollins, and Paul Zeb-
fuss. And speaking of music, Clark
belongs to the world of artists. He
wrote the most adorable song that
we hope deserves to be dedicated to
us. It has the name of “Baby, Say
That You're Mine.” All we need is
to publish the song, but heck, it
takes money. We’ll petition the
Student Loan?

And now I know who has the most
beautiful singing voice in the univer-
sity. Ben Weisman, Pi Lamb. He
wears a buffish kind of a coat that
might be Camel’s hair, and the
young man’s coloring just matches
the coat. We never knew that one
man could look the way he does and
sing and yet not be Rudy Vallee.

Somebody we feel so sorry for,
Morris Cohen. Poor old Morry had
the tough break to place his loyal
bet on the N. D. game 21 to 0, favor
of Pitt. Of all the razzberries
served without sugar, he gets them"
all, but anybody who hands out vio-
let life-savers, well, we don’t think
much of Morry’s taste or guesses.
And for your approval-—Martin Fal-
lon giving an imitation of Moon
Mullins of the N. D. mob gain over
for a touchdown. Marty won ots of
money onthe game and thus he has
his violin, his overcoat and his wrist
watch all out of the pawn shop till
the next time.

Here’s introducing M arina
(Boots) Butera, .a little tennis shark
from Dormont and as good looking
as they make freshman irls these
days. She's a pal of Sal y Rogers,
another good-locker who lets Bob
Klee-b take her around. Are they
These and Those?

We should forbear, but this
Scully boy, Bill to those who know
him, and the way he gets around
everybody must know him, was in
Dick Powell’s party at the N. D.
game Saturday. The other members
of the crowd were Mr. John Harris
and Mr. Stoltz, publicity manager
for Warner’s. Bouquets and bou-
quets-—all for Dick but a couple of
them struck Bill, so maybe one
might say he received some bou-
quets, too . . .

..._o__

And on the subject of style, we
might say that Ben Sufrine, our
chief friend and censor, has a
pseudo raccoon coat that is a doozy.
Gee, I sure would like to see any
one look more like old King Win-
ter than Ben in the coat . . .

Now’s the time to tell you who the
Girl of the Week is and we’re not
bashful at all, at all. She's a little
queen all right, all right. Tri-Delta
and witty us they come. She is
Gladys Pyle. Her heart is in a very
deﬁnite place in New York. - River-
side Drive, to be exact, and although
it may be what you call a propin-
quity crush, Gladys has the young
man down every so often to Tri Delt
affairs. And is he nice too? Ask
Miss Pyle. Don’t you like our choice
now. We’re not so blind after all.

‘Make Appointments,’
R e q u e s t Hostesses

Hostess Committee of W. S. G. A.
has requested that all women who
ve any business in the office of
the Dean of Women at Heinz House
should ﬁrst stop at the Hostess
table and make an appointment or
get permission from the hostess.
Formerly the women have gone in
without asking if the office was
usy. Men are also asked to do this
when in the Heinz House.

A new plan has been adopted to
place a student message box on the
Hostess table. In this the girls may
leave notes for friends.

Rose Marie Demestichas, Col. ’33,
is chairman of the committee, and
Lois Beatty, Ed. ’31, was elected
secretary at the last meeting. A
few hours are still vacant. Any
girls who are interested may apply
to the hostess for a position.

is smiling at Law School now. What
I mean to say is that gorgeous dis-
play of dentistry, and do you re-
member it, is no longer beaming on
Alumni Hall. However, Alice Al-
1on’s smile is working overtime and
maybe one set of teeth is as good

Gene Pry, of the gorgeous dim-
pled chin, won a set of dining room
furniture at a recent show. Before
he won it he said if he were the
lucky guy he would get married, but
he won it and didn't get married, be-
cause, he said, nobody asked him.
Here is your chance girls, furniture,
dimpled chin and all of six feet two
just for the asking, maybe.

Mr. and Mrs. Cowan certainly
distributed‘ their family amongst
the colleges. There is Len who comes
here to school; his sister at Syra-
cuse; one brother_at Penn State and
one brother at Vanderbilt. And
then there is Sylvia Weiner who is
attending here. She has two broth-
ers who are Phi Beta Kappas, ever
hear. of it, and I think they 0 to
Yale or Harvard anyway can
never get the two straight. These
clever people, for instance, there is
Sidney Yecies from somewhere out
McKeesport way who made 3 A’s

 

and 1 B last year and his father was .

so happy Sidney got a trip to Cali-
fornia out of his blue print. Such
marks wouldn’t do me any good, the
shock would be too much. .

Larry Bachman from up Medical
School won’t play the piano when
John St. Peter is around and John
St. Peter won’: play when Larry is
around. They both play devlnely,
goodness, but there is an old rivalry
or something that exists and no
coaxing in the world will make
either of them change their minds.
Incidentally John still gets prett
sore when somebody calls him Bill
Everett and Bill gets sore when he
is called John. ‘They were mixed up
in Ben Sufrlne’s special edition of
the Sun-Tele recently, you know.

Since Cecile Bramer went to Hol-.
land to study, Mary Jane Kline is
sorta struggling along all by her
lonesome. Weren’t they pals or
something. And somebody says,
“imagine Len Mendlowitz on time
for a second hour.” All those fel-
lows from out in McKeesport get
oil’ the train at the Hazelwood sta-
tion and take a. taxi to school. What
class, what class! '

I take an intense pleasure in giv-
ing the Honor Spot this week to
Virginia Wickersham and Clinton
Weslager. Clinton, by the by, fools
the world by being “Sunny” to
everybody. Anyway Virginia and
Sunny are starting things of for the
Student Loan Association at the
Student Loan dance at Webster Hall
tonight. This is really a very worth
while organization. You can see by
‘just looking at the name, and it
would be very, very nice if a whole
crowd of folks turned out to make it
a success. So this is really a triple
Honor Spot: once for Virginia, once
for Sunny and the biggest one for
the Student Loan Association--and
maybe another one for all those
who come to the dance tonight. ’Bye,
’Bye, for right now, folksies, see you

Players To Present Initial
Production Nov. 20

 

The ﬁrst major production of the
Pitt Players, “The Whiteheaded
Boy,” is scheduled for Nov. 20- A
resume of the plot was SW03 by C-
B. Cass, director_ of dramaticsb

The term, “Vvhiteh_eaded b0Y» ‘.110
title of the play, _is an old Irish
nickname which lmplles “famlly
darling” or “mother’s pet.” Robert
Kleeb, Col. ’31, fills the male lead
in the capacity of the “whitehe ded
boy.” Dennis Geoghegan, “ te-
headed boy,” has caused great co_n-
sternation in the lives .of his family
because he has ﬂunked his college’
exams for the third time._

His older brother, who is the pro-
vider for the family, has decided to
discontinue the boy’s allowance and
send him to Canada. According to
Irish custom, Dennis has been be-
trothed to the daughter of a fam-
ily who are old friends of his moth-
er. Delia Duffy, the girl, played by
Elaine Blauvelt, Col. ’34, is broken-
hearted that her marriage must be
postponed.

Her father, Mr. Duffy, played by
Martin Fallon, Col. ’34, decides to
sue the Geoghegan family for
breach of promise. Matters come
to a crisis when Dennis decides to
do as he pleases. Consequently, he
marries Delia’ and gets a job as a
street cleaner. The two families he-
come reconciled and the “white-
headed boy” triumphs after all.

The entire list of characters in-
cludes Louise Cohn, Bus. Ad. ’34,

FRIDAY. OCTOBER 31, 1930

 NOT too early to begin thinking about Senior Week!
 ii program of more interesting events and one partici-

 in by more students’ is to be developed, propC>_Sf1_lS for
. _j I 1 _}program may well- be submitted now, eventhough it is ﬁve
iiﬁntlis in advance. That is why the suggestion made to Stu-
I’  Council this week by an unofficial group of four senior

Jﬁell, deserves attention. ‘
  ‘Realizing that several events last spring were not D8-'¢1‘0T1'
f ibecause Senior Week came after the close of regular cam-
”’.classes, the group is seeking to have those events which
open to all undergraduates, held several weeks before the

of school. They would have such events as fraternity
eepstakes, track meets, parade of the Pantherettes, frater-
y farewell dances and Pitt stunt night, held probably during
 ﬁrst week-end in May. Other events, which are more dis-
 “ﬂnbtly senior class affairs, such as the Senior breakfast, class
ﬁﬁﬁncheons and deans’ receptions, would continue to be held dur-
, " the days immediately preceding graduation exercises.

»‘  There is much logic to these suggestions. Eventsin early
 would not mean the revival of the old Pitt Week, abolished
gem} years ago bythe deans because it detracted toovmuch
 I ‘the study program. There is little use in sponsoring
‘siilleepstakes or parades if they are not better attended than
 those of last spring. If they cannot be held while school
 A session, the only alternative seems to be their complete
-  ‘iiiation from the program. .

 By making the program of events just prior to commence-
' I t distinctly: senior class’ affairs, added emphasis could be
1'5"’ ‘on the signiﬁcance of the program and suﬁicient time
\ib_'uld'be.allowed for the school receptions, one of the most
lpleasinig features of the entire week.

‘  Few would want to see the abolition of the track meets and
epstakes so why not give serious consideration to the plan
-staging them in early May when the entire student body

y take part?

  Sutherland Condemned

R. JOHN BAIN “JOCK" SUTHERLAND, hailed by most
. students of Pitt before last Saturday’s game as the best
 ,, coach in the country, has fallen in their eyes. The rea-
 for this are obvious. Sutherland himself never claimed
 _~.be the best coach in the country; and when a coach loses an
 rtant game, the love of his rooters wane. ,
 J-ust why University students, supposedly one of the most
-  roughly sophisticated and, at least, tolerant bodies of citi-
' is, should take this attitude is neither surprising nor dis-
" raging. The value of popularity was deﬁnitely settled in
 '9’ ‘French Revolution. The hero, once defeated, must fall.
In 1927 when the Golden,Gridders went to the Tournament

 

 

1&8, handicapped by a new squad of men, he developed a team

‘_x’"£_;'!12iarvelous‘ power, and again in 1929 he took Pitt to the Coast.

, - if-predicted. And the student body turns away!

& Saturday, it seemed almost as if Pitt had found itself. Now.

shire "more they evidence their lack of patriotism.

'  Without the backing of the Student ‘Body, no‘ team can suc-

', . The 1930 edition of the Panthers is a team that deserves

“Q1,-yport, even though_they did lose _to a superior squad and

' ' " inst formations which are unfamiliar. What team ever beat
tre Dame the first time they met?

Band Again Makes
Impressive Showing

The "sensational marching and

impressive size” advocated for the
Pitt Band in a front page editorial
in the Pitt Weekly issue of Nov.
22. 1929, was realized with its ap-
pearance at the Notre Dame game
last Saturday. Fairly shining in
their new uniforms and with step
made secure from constant drill un-
der Lieutenant A. E. Wilson, the
Pitt musicians were the sensation of
the afternoon. The letter forma-
tions were little short of perfect and
the addition of ﬁfty members to last
year's band made many of the Pitt
rooters wish that Ohio State's
highly touted aggregation had been
here.
_ The appearance of the entire
corps of cadets, in their newly-pur-
chased uniforms, gave a military

The ﬂoodlight fastened high on

down on State Hall's broad front
steps after dark. It is ii popular
student superstition that this light
was installed to make it uncomforta-
ble for would-be Romeos and Juliets,

to light the steps so that wayfarers

O I C

At the corner of O'Hara and Bou-
quet streets on the University side
of the street a ﬁre alarm and police
call box stand back to back. Evi-
dently, this spot is a strategic one
in the opinion of the “authorities."
The Activities Building is only a
stone's throw distant. (Somebody
ask us what a §l'.0X‘l‘e’S.th!'0W is now.)

The ethereal smell near the oil
and gas experimental laboratory on
O'Hara street seems to be forever
present. The large steel casks con-
tain, or have contained, chemicals
needed for the experiments, as you
have probably deduced for your-
selves, you detectivei, you.

We are pleased to be able to re-
ﬁort that the Cornell pennant in the

ustle Hut was still there in the
d8WI1’8 e3;I‘ly light of last Wednes-
day morning. Some day we expect
to wake u and ﬁnd this triangular
piece of fe t eithez ggne or going.

A new cuspidor in the Panther of-
_ﬁce (second floor. Activities Build-
ing — artists, writers, jokesters,
punsters, copyreaders and typists in
demand) is the quaintest piece of
furniture in the University. Made
of heavy glazed crockery, reddish
brown in color, it has three decks.
Honestly, it must be seen to be ap-
preciated. The Yale-Harvard-Prince

ﬁnal date on which subscriptions of
senior class members will be ac-
cepted has been extended until No-
vember 7, 1930.

This. time extension has been
made so_that seniors who desire to

panylng paragraph on their- campus
interests published in the Owl, as
planned, may do so,

Senior subscri tions may be
placed with the fo lowing, any time

Distinctive features of the 1931
Owl are announced ‘by the editorial
board of the publication, Charles
Seidle, Florence Luman, both C01,
31, and Harold Price, Bus. Ad. '31.

This year’s book will feature for
the ﬁrst time in the history of the
University the pictures of the mem-
bers of the senior class. There will
be a picture and a paragraph de-
voted to every senior.

The art plan for the 1931 Owl will
embody many features never before
used. Byron Robertson, chief stall’
artist of the Bureau of Engraving,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, is directing
the art work of the book. M. Brad-
bury of the bureau has already sub-
mitted to the editorial board three
etchings that are to appear in the
Campus View section. This section
will contain eight steel etchings of
famous spots 'o_r.buildings on the
campus. Subdivision pages, inserts
and other sections of the book are
being completed by the engravers.

Coed Directs Sales

The_ Senior Owl campaign is under
the direction of Ann Kovach, Col.
’31, circulation manager.

She has appointed a senior in each
school on the campus in order that
he_may ‘take charge of the Owl cam-
paign in the_ respective schools.
Those appointed are Carnan

(Humble Truth.‘ one urged this
column to glreatevr levity, protesting
that these earnest paragraphs were,
perhaps, too, too serious. We ‘did
not reneg; we do not intend to do
so. We even admit feeling stupid
when we say ‘we’ when we mean ‘I.’
At any rate, unless one’s sense of
humor is as dry as a. mummy, he
will discern that this drivel is the
reaction which sets in once a week
after our debauch of laughter at the
world in which we Live.)

At a time like this, a let-ter comes
to us from a fellow-studcn_t who is
now in school. A quotation from

the letter follows: “My
STUDENT existence has been
LE'I'l‘ER troubled of late,‘ trou-
bled in that it Is too
full of events, disturbingly novel. 
reat part‘ of my time I spend in
earning and teaching. These are
novel events, for, although this is
my fourth year in college, I must
say that now, for the first time, I
am consciously learning, not letting
Education take me unawares. I do
not know whether I am unique or
not; my knowledge of school lifeis
limited to this school. But I’-* be-
lieve I am only one of a large group
who are realizing, ‘somewhat sud-
denly, that the past several years
of their Education have been almost
proﬁtless. At any rate, those of my
friends who are seniors this year
appear to me to be looking at them-
selves and the things which touch
them with a new gravity and con-
cern. Is this a recurring phenome-
non of the last year in college,
brought about by the realization
that soon the problem of earning
our livelihood will assume its true
proportions? I do not know. How-
ever, I do know positively that I
am deliberately trying to gain
knowledge and this is a new experi-
ence, and a somewhat disturbing
one." ‘

The letter makes me wonder what
I have gained from the University
world. I wonder, and try to think
of what other students seem to have
acquired in college. Some rather
peculiar thoughts come to mind. 1
see around me students who dis-
play the nauseous self-satisfaction
of small successes. They have ac-
quired Self-Conﬁdence. I see that
we have all ceased to be conscious
of our contemptible, or merely ri-
diculous, pre-occupation with detail.
I see that we think infrequently,
even for youths, that our ideas are
as dull as the average textbook.

I see that often our lives are as
thin as our thoughts, that we speak
with the pompous little voice.of a
professional reformer, a voice as
thin as a yellow bean. I see that
we have allowed Education to mean
“pounding into” as well as “lead-
ing out of.” We go about our ac-
tivities with methods as obvious as
the duty of a scarecrow. We have
been swamped in a sea of logic as
full of holes as a Psychology Sylla-
bus. We go about instructing one
another to avoid Platitudes, since
we lack the subtlety to perceive that
They can be of inﬁnite usefulness.
Oh, but we are So ell-adjusted! In
fact, we are like gains of rice in
a bag——subst:mtial. slightly polished
and very, very much alike.

Annual Party

Eligible Majors In Science To
Be Guests At Dinner

Under the supervision of Mar-
garet, Reinherr, Col. '31, Quax, wom-
en's honorary scientiﬁc fraternity,
will entertain women eligible to the
group on Thursday, November 6 at
the annual fall party to be held at
the Heinz House at 6 o'clock. This
being an honorary society, the wom-
en may be.referred to as “rushees..”
These rushees, consisting of promi-
nent Junior and Senior women who
are majoring in' science, will be en-
tertained at this occasion with a
dinner at 6 o’clock.

Mary Borland, Ed. ’31, is the so-
cial chairman, and she is being as-
sisted by Jean Davis, Ed. '32; Jean
Mosco, Ed. ’31, and Miriam Bott,
Ed. '30. Sara Cook, Ed. '31, is the
membership campaign chairman.

Staniland to Talk

At 7 o’clock, the meeting will be
opened to all students, at which
time Mr. Albert E. Staniland, in-
structor of mathematics, will speak
on the subject “The Philosophy of
Mathematics.”

At this early date, plans have al-
ready been visualized far in ad-
vance. About the _middle of Janu-
ary, there will be a party for fresh-
man women, the primary purpose
of which is to acquaint them with
the members of the science faculty.
They will discuss the future of sci-
ence as a possibility for a liveli-
hood.

An additional feature will be a
program planned by Grace Coulter,
Col. ’32, chairman, assisted by Edith
Raschen, Col. ’32, and Vivian Craw-
ford, Ed. ’32.‘ -

Frenchman To Give
Disarmament Speech

M. Pierre de Lanux, brilliant
young French lecturer, author and
director of the Paris Information
Office of the League of Nations, will

 

lecture on “The Outlook for Dis-
armament” at 2:30 o’clock Tuesday,
November 4, at Heinz House.

M. Lanux’s previous experience
well qualiﬁes him to lecture on his
chosen subject. He is the author of
many works dealing with interna-
tional problems, including “Life of
Henry IV.,” “Jugoslavia,” “Young
France and New America,” and
“Eveil d’une Ethique Internation-

e.

ous times served as war correspond-
ent, translator and member of sev-
eral peace conferences.

At present M. Lanux is making
a nation-wide tour under the aus-
pices of the Carnegie Endowment

pearance at the University is spon-
sdred by the International Relations
Club, composed of Dr. Benjamin F.
Williams’ class in international re-
yations, and will be free to the pub-
ic.

Cass Starts Make-up
Class In Dramatics

C. B. Cass, dramatic instructor of
the University, has widened his al-
ready extensive department by or-
ganizing a class for “make-up” in-
struction.

Cass, who has had wide experi-
ence in this ﬁeld for many years
previous to his coming to Pitt, is
writing his own book entitled,
“Stage Make-Up,” for use in the
class.

After the class has advanced suf-
ﬁciently, Cass will turn all make-
up work for his productions over to
the students.

With all of the Cass enterprises,
Pitt Players have once again as-
sumed its rightful position in the
University activities list. This is a
welcome transformation to those
who have been dramatically inclined.

Nebraska will be anything but

easy; in fact they are one of. the

- 1 ~ most powerful teams in the country,

 -and the Panthers will be in for an-

- other typical Cornhusker afternoon.

Pitt is one team that Nebraska

wantsto beat. They were unable to

. y do it last year, and their great team

of 1928 could do no better than hold

ghting Sutherland bunch even.

aturday the Big Six cham-

* pions enjoyed a breather in Mon-

rtanq State, and tomorrow they will

,be in ﬁrst class condition for their
_ __ Z guests from Pittsburgh.

Rumblings from the much dis-
.,eussed Notre Dame game are_ still
" in the air, and it is rather inter-
;  eating to recall what the Ramblers
.'.. themselves thought of the affair. The
,,Notre Dame boys all agree that the
‘Panthers ,have “a good team,” but
 in-tbelieve that Dr. Sutherland’s bunch
rates just a triﬂe lower than a
championship club. The Irish were
 also impressed with the playin of
3;.-..;-«Captain Eddie Baker, and Joe or-
,.~.,--.mey, Daughtery’s understudy. They
, -had only the highest praise for Tor-
- mey, and consider that he is bound
. to be heard from in future games.
They think that the Tech-Pitt game
.- .will be close, but favor the Tartans
slightly. And those, children, are
1  views of the lads from South
,.~.-_-Bend; take them ‘as you will.

Pitt is ready to start just where
, _she left off last week. The Panthers
-~"-were going places in that last quar-
ter, andwil do more of that little
Bthing this Saturday. Nebraska has
__ a fast backﬁeld and a good line. As
i" usual, the Cornhuskers have plenty
of power behind their attack, and
_ _, the Pitt forwards will have to go
. .-wthrough another battering session.
g . Pitt teams are at their best, how-
:' ever, against squads like Nebraska,
.-,, and tomorrow ‘will be no exception.
The Pitt offense is speeding up,
and the backs have reached their
usual November form. November is
the‘ month when Panther teams have
-.- ~. -achieved their greatest accomplish-
, _ments, and tomorrow starts the
-2-+---ononth of victories. Nebraska is the
ﬁrst in line, and then comes Tech,
Ohio, and Penn 

 Both Pitt and Tech will have their
hands full this week. N. Y. U.
should give Carnegie a, very nice
workout, and Nebraska should do
the same for our Panthers. Tomor-
row we will get the chance to watch

' the Plaid go through their motions
at the stadium, and after that is
over, will have a better idea of what
next week's battle will be like. Un-
til then we will keep our peace, and

' -;keep the slate ready to mark up

the Panther’: win over the Corn-
huskers. That will be the ﬁfth win

Little if no credit has been given
to the members of the swimming
 “teams representing the University
“Hot Pittsburgh in the past. For the
" ’ ‘ most part, their achievements have
gone unsung; and of all these, the
».-'.record of Fred Wooldridge, varsity
. gitcaptain for the past two years, is
9 ,;‘,most impressive.
' 3 When Peabody high school won
_ ‘ ‘ " the city championship in 1926 and
--in’ 1927, Wool-dridge was at the
-. -.helm. During his high school career,
Fred set Pittsburgh scholastic rec-
ords in the 100-yard freestyle, the
100-yard backstroke, and the 40-
yard freestyle events. His time of
58 2/5 seconds and 21 seconds still
‘stand as marks for the 100-yard and
.40-yard freestyle events. His time
of 1:08 in the 100-yard backstroke
 broken by Henry Stanton,
1131118? high and Mercersburg
Academy_ ace, now holder of the
world's in-terscholastic backstroke
record for a short course.

Freshman Star
_ Fred entered the University Sep-
"f,°11_¥b°§o 1927- As a freshman,
,_, ,KIski" was the outstanding mem-
‘ of the team, and during this
_ he set a pool record at Car-

Sui‘:-Station
B-E-N-C-I-I

This is Sub-Station B-E-N-C-H
comin on the air by remote con-
trol t rough the courtesy of the
Pitt Weekly Sports department.
Every Friday at ten-thirty you will
get the “dope” on the Panther grid-
ders through this station.

Well, folks, we got trimmed Sat-
urday, and I’m not going to give
any alibis like the Campus Scout,
because I ﬁgure those Irishmen (?)
were perfect on that day. Every-
thing they tried worked like an El-
gin movement, while everything we
tried seemed to work like the
broken down movement of the Big
Ben.

In the above paragraph, I said I
wasn’t going to give any alibis but
I may as well tell you a little inci-
dent that happened before the game.
You remember I told you that even
if I didn’t play, I would be an in-
spiration to the team sitting on the
hardwood. Well, about two hours
before game time when I was get-
ting ready to go over and show
Rockne how my presence would-de-
moralize his team and how it would
inspire our boys, one of my frater-
nitiy; brothers stole my pants.
loo ed and looked for another pair
but my frat brothers are so cheap
that they only own one pair each
and there wasn’t any for me to
wear. So I sat there listening to
the radio (somebody donated it) un-
til the middle of the second quarter,
when all of a sudden it struck me
3-5 3 good idea to cut up our table-
cloth_ and make a pair of pants,

With my new trousers I dashed
over _to the Stadium in less time
than it takes to tell about it. When
the boys saw me their faces lit up
with broad smiles, and they were
asking what happened to me. When
I told them, they were ready to
shoot everybody in my frat. But I
told them to save their energy for
these Notre Dame boys. Well, you
know yourself what happened in the
second half. Not that I’m boosting
myself or anything, but I know we
would have won if I’d of been there

Dame Lead In Race
For National Title

With King football swxn ng into
the last half of its season, e teams
representing the. West and the
South have deﬁnitely proved that
for this year at least it CY _31‘° 511'
preme over the representatives of
the East and the’ Southwest.-

Notre Dame, a mid-western
school, has the best record to date
of any school in the country but

' . they must hurdle two more difficult

opponents before they can claim the
championship of the countI'Y 1111'
challenged. _

N orthwestern, which meets Notre
Dame three weeks from tomorrow.
has the best chance of wresting na-
tional laurels from. Knute Rockne’s
men. Thus far, Dick .Hanley’s men
have been the prize hard luck team

epidemic" among the
and ineligibility.
I Bruder Returns

With the return of Hank _Bruder,
backﬁeld ace, to the squad this week,

players, injuries

' things are looking -up for the Illi-

nois boys and they hope to go
ithrough the remainder _of their
schedule, without suffering such
ltough breaks as they have- encoun-
tered thus far. _

Northwestern’s most notable vic-
tories to date have been over Tu-
lane and Illinois. The latter team
was beaten 32-0. The Northwestern
team's play to date has been fea-
tured by the work of Baker, veteran
end, who seems to» be a sure bet for
an all-American berth. ,

In the South, Vanderbilt with a
33-7 victory over Minnesota; Geor-
gia, con uerors of Yale and Tulane
are the
tional honors. Should all three of
these teams ﬁnish the remainder of
their schedule without tastin de-
feat, Vanderbilt will probab y be
recognized as champion due to its
easy victory over the team which
held Stanford to a 0-0 tie.

In the;Southwest, Southern Meth-
odist, Baylor and Texas A. and M.,
three perennial contenders for
championship honors, have all
either been tied‘ or defeated. There
is no outstanding team in this sec-
tion. '

Huskies Lead On Coast

Washington State with victories
over both California and Southern
California leads the parade on the
Paciﬁc Coast. The balance of the
Washington schedule is fairly easy
so that the Huskies should have no
trouble ﬁnishing their season with
a perfect record. Their schedule,
however, includes teams only from
their own section, thus eliminating
them from claims to a national title.

In the East, Dartmouth, Fordham
and Western Maryland are the lone
-major teams with a clean slate to
date. None of these teams faces
a hard schedule this season so that
they will not be taken seriously
when season's honors

out.

It is probable that either Pitt,
Carnegie Tech or Colgate may prove
themselves better than one of these
teams and it is not improbable that
two of the above schools may meet
in a post-season game for the cham-
pionship of the East.

Record Crowd Sees Uneven
Struggle At Stadium

While more than 72,000 grid fans
jammed the stadium last_ Saturday,
a Sutherland eleven almost lived up
to the prediction of its coach that
they would be beaten by three touch-
downs. Hampered by injuries, by the
loss of last year's stars, and bythe
lack of reserves, the Panther team
bowed to a 35-19 defeat before‘ a
Rockne machine that functioned per-
fectly. _

Those-burly Irishmen, Carideo, Sa-
voldi, Brill and Schwartz, complete-
ly dominated in the ﬁrst half. After
Schwartz’ 60-yard run two minutes
after the kickoif, it was Notre
Dame’s own show,
stunned Panthers as their audience.
All the psychology that had been

Pitt’s only advantage was swept,

away, all the hopes of crushing a
team that might_ not be as strong
as they were a Week before vanished.
Every time the ball was captured by
the South Benders in the ﬁrst half
it was carried by them down the ﬁeld
for a touchdown.

Morale Saved

The morale of the Pitt team and
of thousands of rooters was saved
when Jimmy Clark and Reider car-
rled the ball over the goal line in the
second half. But it is to be remem-
bered that in the second half the
Panthers faced second and third
stringers whom Rockne had substi-
tuted for the regulars.

Eddie Baker, the ca tain, showed
that he still had his a ility to kick,
interfere, and tackle, as did also

Jimmie Clark. Ernie Lewis shone on-

the line together with Milligan.
Daugherty showed promises of play-
ing a bril i
in the second quarter.

Knute Rockne has developed a
team this year that will surpass the
far-famed team of 1924. With
Carideo, Schwartz, Brill and Savoldi,
he has probably the best backﬁeld
in the country.

West Virginia Plebes. Will
I -Be Formidable Foe

The Pitt Freshmen go to Mor-
gantown tomorrow afternoon where
they will renew their bid for the

“Little Four” championship when
they meet the West Virginia Plebes.
The Pitt Cubs have only played one
game to date in the “Little Four”
competition, having held the Tab
tan Plebes to a scoreless tie. They
still have the Wash-Jeff frosh to
meet after tomorrow's game to
complete their schedule. '

West Virginia also held the Car-
negie Plebes to a scoreless tie, so

marks of a real battle. They tied
Glenville Normal, one of the strong-
est preparatory teams in West Vir-
ginia, and defeated Potomac State
by a six to nothing score.

_ Mountaineers In Form

, “Trusty” Tallman, West Virgin-
ia’s frosh grid coach, hopes to have
all his men in good condition for
the coming battle. Last week
against the Tartans, his two centers,
Wright and Belota, were on the
bench due to injuries, as were his
two fullbacks, Lepera and Covey.
These men will be available tomor-
row, so West Virginia will be able
to‘ muster their strongest lineup
against the Panther Cubs.

Those men who have looked the
best in previous encounters were
Engler and Rine at the terminal po-
sitions, Anderson at tackle, and
Stone as signal barker, who has
proved to be the best ball carrier
and interferer in the Mountaineer’s
backﬁeld. The baby Mounta.ineer’s

evidenced during the Tech game,

Famous Movie Star Cheer-st
Panthers On Gridiron

By ROBERT R. MORRIS

dian of stage and screen fame,
cheered for the Panthers last Sat-
urday from a ﬁfty-yard box. _Dur-
ing Joe’s visit at Camp Hamilton,
where he was the guest of W. D.
Harrison, director of athletics, he
expressed his desire to be with the
Panthers on that particular day.
Brown became quite chummy
with the Pitt boys during their vis-
it to the coast last New Year’s and
served as a sort of toastmaster and
master of ceremonies at a banquet
held in the honor of the Pittsburgh
squad. It was Joe and his comic
actions that helped the somewhat
tamed Panthers break a smile af-
ter that fatal New Year’s game.

Dual Character

At this time, it may be well to
tell you that Joe E. Brown pos-
sesses somewhat of a dual charac-
ter. Those of you who may have
been fortunate enough to make his
acquaintance, realize that he is
not always the dancing, big-
mouthed, wise-cracking comedian
who keeps a theater audience in an
uproar, but at times just plain Mr.
Br0‘Z.'1l'_WI‘I.l‘l a Wife and a lasting
pride in his two growing boys.

While Brown was visiting foot-
ball canip the latter part of the
summer, he entertained the boys
after dinner with a. few of his stage
sketches. What an audience it was
for a topnotcher like Brown to per-
form for. Sun-tanned huskiw, clad
in sleeveless -undershirts, laughing
through half—grown whiskers, but
he seemed to enjoy it thoroughly
and laughed right back at the gang.

After the performance, Captain

"Eddie Baker presented Brown with

a football, autographed by every
member of the squad. A rather

.. meager reward for the great one,

just a ball with a conglomeration
of names scrawled in the humblest
fashion. But Joe accepted it with
the eager eyes. of a twelve-year-old,
held the ball high in tllB__,,8.1'1‘ with
one hand and opened his mouth
wide. “It's another act,” whispered
one of the frosh, “he’s goin’ to put
the whole ball in his mouth.”
Expresses Gratitude _
But, alas! Joe was only getting
a breath to express his gratitude.
His few words of thanks lacked the
smooth ﬁnish of an orator or the
waxy luster of a politician. They
contained only a few humble ex-
pressions that none but a truly
grately person could utter.
Brown's connection with the Pan-
thers has been gained through the
friendships he made while e team
was in Hollywood last s . on, and
his close acquaintance Wllth Ray
Montgomery, All-American of last
year, who was featured in Mr.
Brown’s latest picture. ‘

74,233 Fans View
Panther-Irish Game

For the first time. since _it was
built, the Pitt stadium was Jammed
to capacity when 74,233 spectators
saw the game l.ast_ Saturday. Not
only was the stadium completely
ﬁlled but extra bleachers seating
thousands were‘built, and standing
room tickets were sold. The sta-

dium was completely sold out six

da ‘s D€fJI'€ the game._

That every precaution had been
taken to keep the tickets out of the
hand’. of speculators was shown in
the fact that among the couple of
thousan.d tickets picked up in the
possession of scalpers and their vic-
.ims only a.’ comparative few were
genuine.‘ ‘

With real football weather and a
jammed stadium, the game was a.
gala affair. The 120-piece band
was present and for the first time
the entire‘ R. C. cadets
marched in. Among the many no-
tables were Joe E. Brown, the ﬁlm
comedian; former Governor Pinchot
and Chancellor Bowman. 5

1. Your scout had time only to study out the Pitt total. He
guessed it would be 21, but Eddie Baker tried to make a liar out
of him so he purposely missed two ties for extra points. If your
favorite had had time to ﬁgure out the N otre Dame total, he would
have put down 35 points for the Irish(?).

2.- Your scout originally p

redicted that Notre Dame would

score 35 points but due to a typographical error, the score was

Seriously speaking, however, the result of the game was due more
to the weakness of the Pitt team than to the near perfection of the Notre

Dame Boys. The consensus of opini

on among the boys in the press box

was that Pitt lost its nerve after Schwartz made that 60-yard run for a

touchdown on the ﬁrst play which N

otre Dame tried from scrimmage.

This is a rather serious charge to make against any footballilteam but
there must be some basis for such a. charge as the Pitt boys certainly did

Rekers, Detwiler Set New
Intercollegiate Record

Coach Shea’s cross-country run-
nets went down to defeat last Satur-
day. losing to the strong Penn State
team, 40 to 15, a perfect score for
tlﬂ visitors. Rekers and Detwiler,
both of Penn State, broke the In-
tercollegiate record for the ﬁve and
three-eighths miles course by divid-

. ing the honors for ﬁrst place with

the fast time of 27:39 2-5.

Clise, Caesar, Smoyer, Mazzei and
Thiele of Pitt, took sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth and tenth places, re-
spectively, for the varsity harriers._

-The Pitt: freshmen, however, fared
much better than did their seniors,
defeating the Penn State frosh with
a close 26-29 final point score. Eng-
land of State, carried off ﬁrst place
with the excellent time of 14:51,
while Eisenhart took second place
for Pitt ‘with an equally commend-

, able time of 14:54.

The  frosh eventually carried
off secon:i,.third, sixth, seventh and
eighth places to clinch the honors
for the day.

Meet Orange

A picked -varsity and. freshman
squad left last night for Syracuse,
N. Y., where they will meet two of

‘ the country's most powerful cross-

country teams, those of S racuse
University. The men who wil make
the trip for the varsity are: Clise,
Caesar, ‘ Smoyer, Mazzei, Thiels,
Tapp and Santicola. The freshman
squad will include Captain Eisen-
hart, Lawrence, Platt, Watkins, Kel-
ler, May and Kunz.

be an uneven tussle, for the apple
state spikers have justin the past
few weeks humiliated, with perfect
scores, both Hobart and Columbia
Universities. In ‘the Columbia event,
the Syracuse team took the first ﬁve
places, with Belanger and Streeter
tying for first in the good time of
twenty-four minutes and 16 seconds.

The course fwhich is to be-covered

Council

University of Pittsburgh,

Dear Mr. Arens:

As the calendar approaches
November 15th, we are once
again reminded of the wonder-
ful hospitality extended to the
followers of the Ohio State
football team on the occasion of
our visit to Pittsburgh last
year. The hospitality of fra-
ternity men as displayed by the
chapters on your campus has,
within our memory, never been
excelled. Everyone appreciated
it.
We hope a. large number of
your fraternity men will be «able
to make the trip to Columbus
for the game this year. The
game with the Panthers is eag-
erly anticipated. by all the 10-
cal fans.

Please extend a hearty wel-
come on our behalf to all mem-
bers‘ of your Council with the
hope from us that many of
them will be. able to come to
Columbus for the game. Fra-
ternities on our campus having
chapters at Pittsburgh are plan-
ning receptions and are urged
to write their Pittsburgh chap-
ters urging them all to follow
the team. Members of the stu-
dent body here will meet the in-
coming special train.

‘ The fraternity houses will be
prepared to see you one and all. ,
So welcome to Ohio. and its hos-
pitality. We hope your stay
here will be a pleasant one “and
we assure you we will do all
that we can to see that it is.
Very sincerely,
' Herbert Zeigler,
Secretary’ of Council
of Ohio State
Fraternity Presidents.

Pitt men’ who are planning to en-
ter the ministry do not belong to
the conventional namby-pamby type
of story-book clergy if their pres-
ent activity is any proof. Under
the leadership of Reed Miller, Col.
'32, all those boys who intend to
enter the ministry haveorganized a
ministers’ club which is only wait-
ing for official approval from the
office of the Dean of Men to be.
come ‘a recognized campus activity.

According to present plans the
club will hold meetings every two
weeks. The ﬁrst of these meetings
was held Friday evening, Oct, 24,
in the First United Presbyterian
church, 4001 Fifth avenue. Officers
elected at this meeting are: presi-
dent, Reed Miller, Col. ’32; vice
president, E. Ray Burchell, Col. ’33,
and secretary and treasurer, Cljf-
ford E. Davis, Col. ’32.

All denominations are included in
the [group and representative min-
isters will speak to the men during
the year. An open forum will fol-
low each of these talks. Most of
the boys» are, themselves, doing out-
side preaching and travel weekly to
nearby country churches. One of
them, Richard Owens, Ed. ’32, has
a regular church in Suterville, Pa.
No easy job for a student to man-
age in addition to his school work!

Works Part-Time

Not only are the members inter-
ested and active in clerical work, but
many of them are, also, working to

. plut themselves through school. Ira

lon National Bank at night; Reed
