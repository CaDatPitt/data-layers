Story of Scoop

No Mabe|'s Fable

By Maxwell P. Scherb
Little Mabel McGrail, plump secretary to John B. Nickla.s,vchair-
man of the student-alumni committeeeinvestigating the athletic situa-
tion here,‘ ﬁnds herseifein the limelight and doesn’t like it.
Miss McGrai1 is largely responsible for the storm that broke

about Pitt when the committee’s

Monday was W a s h in g t o n’s<>

Birthday and.Mabel’s undoing.
Just before lunchtime, Miss
McGrail received a phone call

Chancellor Fitzgerald’s secretary.
She wanted to know why there-

port hadn’t been receivedviatr the —

University.

Mabel patiently explained that
it was Washington’s Birthday and
that no mail was being ‘delivered
that day. The woman said she
needed the report‘ that very. af-

_ ternoon because the Trustees were

meeting to consider it.

Mabel was stumped for awhile
but jumped quickly at the solu-
tion’ offered by the “secretary.”
A messenger would be a ﬁne way
of accommodating. everyone. So,
the report went to a messenger.
The next day itewas published b —
the Sun-Telegraph. ,’

Naturally, Miss McGrail felt
disturbed about the whole thing.
When questioned she said, “The
ﬁrst report (Saturday’s)-was de-
livered all right but Monday’s
riever arrived.” ,

The newspapermen and pho-
tographers who questioned her for
more . details l annoyed Miss 0 Mc-
Grail. They interfered with her
normal duties. They bothered her
for statements.

Attention like this is alright for
movie queens but not for a hard-
working secretary. By noon, she.
was disheveled and as tired as if
she had put in two working-days.
Everyone in the McCrady-Rogers

The Pitt News arrived in the
afternoon. Mabel wasn’t talking.
She closed the interview by ma-
jestically disappearing into the

Ladies’ Room.

Kermit Is Man of

Kermit Roosevelt, writer and
speaker, will be the first in a trio
of speakers sponsored by Student
Congress to speak at Foster Hall,
2_:30vto 4 p.m'. on Wed., March 3.

Mr. Roosevelt’s topic will be
“The Arabs Live There, Too.” His
speech will take in the basic issue
between Arab and Jew, the claims
of each and the. arguments on
which they rest. He will hit upon
the Jewish Communal farms, in-
dustry, local development; Arab
steps toward self-improvement;
relations between Jew and Arab
terrorist groups.

Mr. Roosevelt has had a diver-
siﬁed career. He went to school at
Buck-163’, Groton and Harvard,
graduating from Harvard in three
years with honors. For two years
his graduation, he taught history,
chieﬂy modern European history,
at Harvard.

In the summer of 1941, he was
taken on by General Donovan in
his newly-created Office of the
Co—ordinator of Information. He

Zionist Protests

Win Concessions

When all was said and done

at last Tuesday's meeting between

Student Congress and Intercollegiate Zionist Federation represen-

tatives, Student Congress decided

to stick to its original plan, except

for minor changes, and have Kermit Roosevelt speak at 2:30 p. In.
in Foster Memorial Hall on March 3.

The minorchanges in Congress’ originalplan were embodied, in
a resolution which asked for a question and answer period not in

,Five Pitt students distributing leaflets plugging Henry Wallace
got a cold reception on the Duquesne University campus Tuesday.
In a recent press release, they condemned what they Qalled

Ruth Goldworth, spokesman for
the group, is chairman of the
newly, formed Pitt students for
Wallace, thesame group that dis-
tributed ﬂyers at Pitt, without in-
cident Monday. Other Pitt stu-
dents that were involved at Du-
quesne were‘: Shirley Alpern, an
executive member of the group;

Marilyn Zimmering and Eugene .

Jaffe. ‘

Downtown papers reporting the
incident said the ﬁve were un-
ceremoniously ushered, oﬁ the
campus by an antagonistic group,
led by Duke football players. Miss
Goldworth said that for 40 min-
utes the pamphlet idistribution
progressed peacefully on the cam-
pus sidewalks until a crowd col-
lected, led by three or four “bur-
ly boys.” ~

Catcalls and heckling came from
the crowd, which by then was
openly antagonistic. The leader,

then marched to her car, follow-

June, 1945. While on sick leave,
he wrote articles which Were pub-
lished in‘Harper’s and The Read-
ier’s Digest and which led, him to
embark upon a career of writing.
Although he has as yet published
comparatively little in magazines,
Mr. Roosevelt's w r i t i n g has
achieved a wide ‘circulation.

After his release from the Army
in 19:16, he was asked to take
charge of an official report on the
war time activities of the Oﬂice of
Strategic Services. In his govern-
ment work, he drafted large sec-
tions of ‘ President Roosevelt's
lend-lease reports to Congress.

Mr. Roosevelt’s chief interests
are writing,‘ history and ﬂying.
During the war Mr. Roosevelt
traveled extensively, both as a
civil servant and as a soldier, in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Pales-
tine, Iran and Ethiopia. While
working for the State Department
in Cairo in 1943, he first became
the .Palestine
problem. ‘

He is planning another trip to
the*Middle East this summer.

 

4Pthe contract for his talk with the

students.

The young Zionist representa-
tives had objectect to Mr. Roose-
velt, whom they consider biased
in favor of the Arabs, speaking
here unchallenged and unopposed.
They recognized, however, that it
was too late for Congress to get a
pro-Zionist speaker to participate
in a debate with Mr. Roosevelt.

. As an alternative, the Zionists
offered to get a pro-Zionist
speaker here a week or two after
Mr. Roosevelt’s talk. They would
provide part of the money, they
said, but they would like Congress
toeput up at least a small portion

they were sponsoring the pro-
Zionist speaker just as they were
Kermit Roosevelt.

Congress thought it would be
unwise to promise a group to
sponsor theirspeaker and thereby
set a precedent.

Bob Ingrim, chairman of the
Assemblies Committee, which had
engaged Mr. Roosevelt, told Con-
gress that he had heard that
there would be picketing of Fos-

Roosevelt spoke.

Although interested in both the Student-Alumni and Faculty Com-

Anonymously, they talked very freely.

F “Firing Hagan_ can’t solve our
problem,”,_ explained one first
stringer. “We never see him, and
I honestly don’t know whether this
present mess is his fault.”

Fire Hagan and Mike will hang
himself next season.” With the
majority, however, head man
Mike Milligan was taboo as a
topic for conversation.

Three linemen were particularly
bitter over their treatment by the
Student-Alumni Committee and
they got plenty of support from’
their _teammates.

“We spent four hours telling
the Committee what we thought
about the past season. Then some
time later we found out Mike had
the whole_ story,” explained one
of the trio.

“We’re going to be here for a
while and there's no use ’gettin_
farther in the hole ‘With’ Mike.
Keep your eye on Spring practice
nextmonth. You'll see how we
feel.” '

general, comments came thick and
fast. “Why is everyone suspicious

oiﬁce?” asked one youngster.

with our problems.” , ,

“I don't even know Hagan, let
mittee.” ’

“What's all the fuss about sui-
cide schedule?” was on every-
one's question parade. “We never
objected to the schedule, only the
preparation. Who wants toplay
Oshkosh Tech and win 75-0?”

Another frequent complaint was
the lack of an adequate training
table. The players felt this em-
phasized the disinterested attitude
of the Athletic Department.

But the most frequently ex-
pressed complaint was directed at

Hurry Up . . . and Wait

The Athletic Committees’ reports awaiting
action by the Board of Trustees, either today
or sometime in the near future, pose a prob-
lem of considerable intricacy for that group.
The Board is up against the old task of pleas-
ing one faction or another, or forgetting about
both. They have a difficult task lined up.

The report of the “temporary committee of
six” cites many policy items which it thinks

should be changed. Signiﬁcant among these
is the request that the Athletic Committee of

the future retain little in the way of adminis- '

trative powers; that these powers be given to
the Director of Athletics or the Graduate
Manager of same. The Faculty report, how-
ever, claims that the trouble lies -in that the
Athletic Committee of today has too little ad-
ministrative power. How will the board de-
cide?‘

Mike Milligan’s ouster and the retention
of Jimmy Hagan feature the lengthy faculty
report. They give deﬁnite reasons for both
moves. The temporary group’s decision on this
matter is to ﬁre Hagan and retain, Milligan.
This report, also, contains some choice morsels
for reasons. So, where does the Board stand?
If it decides to accept either one report or
the other here, it is stepping on toes. If it ﬁres
both men, or retains both men, it is refuting
the reasoning of both committees. A ticklish
situation.

One redeeming feature about both reports
is their request for a new set-up in the Athletic
Committee._ For the student body and the alum-
ni, this means deﬁnite representation in this
group.

Other issues were dealt withifairly" and

If give the impression that both groups thought‘

about the situation andinvesftigated it to some

L length. Both groups deserve consideration for
tackling a difﬁcult and touchy job.

. All that remains is for some statement of
deﬁnite action by the University Board of
Trustees. In the hopes of starting a new schol-
astic and athletic year and era, we hope that
the statement comes soon.

Pitt Chest Contracts

The decision of Student Congress to go
back on its previous word concerning the Pitt
Chest Plan is little less than_alarming. Through
a concerted “pass the buck”.efEort, Congress

shunted its right" to put teeth into the Chest -

Plan when it referred the question of the Red
Cross Drive coming up to the Chest Council.

At the time the new plan was on the draft-
ing board here, its originators were, or should
have been, well aware that the Red Cross had
rejected similarinvitations tosjoin in campus-
wide drives at the Universities‘ of Washington
and Southern California. There is no reason
to suppose that they will now, or in the future,
join in the Pitt Chest Plan.

That Pitt’s, decision to push one drive"

throughout the year has placed Dean ,Wilbur
I. ‘Newstetter on the spot is not denied, How-
ever, the Pitt News carried the full story of
the drive and its all-encompassing effects when

~ it received official Congress sanction last sem-

 

ester. DeanVNewstetter was “in wrong” by
supposing that Pitt would continue with pre-
vious precedent without consulting the body
directly in charge of student affairs .. .. ..
Student Congress.

Another startling outcome of the reversal‘

of plans is the fact that almost all members
of Congress, in an informal poll conducted. by
its president, declared that they’ would stick
by ..the Chest Plan decision in this instance.
What caused the change in policy?

I VVe do not like to place any member of the
University on the spot when it comes to out-
side dealings; but, this decision of Congress
to permit a student wide Red Cross Drive. on
campus this spring has made them the
target for any organization which feels above
joining in the Pitt Chest Plan.

Ah yes, there’s even a “new look” in publicity
these days. ’

Why Doesn'f. Someone
Come Ouf and Say
What He Means

Harry Byron Keck

Hitherto my impression of publicity was any-
thing written, printed, spoken or done to .tell peo-
ple that something was going to happen, but that
type of if publicity ‘went out of style with the ex-
posed knee.

My handy little pocket Webster describes
publicity as any information designed to ad-

vance the interests of a place, person or cause.
Poor old Noah just lacked foresight. The
crimes that 20th century college students
commit behind the aegis “publicity” was be-
yond the cognition of the old lexicographer.

The curent frustration-type publicity all be-
gan with the Freshman Dance committeefs idea
of ‘plastering signs throughout the campus‘ ad-
monishing one and‘ all against the evils of becoming
501. ’

Now a publicity committee, according to my
old fashioned conceptions, is supposed to get across
to potential customers the idea that an impending
dance is the greatest event since the ‘Penn’ State‘
Pep Rally. When I ﬁrst sawithe “Don’t Be 501”
slogan, I ‘didn’t rush off to secure my ticket for’
the annual frosh minuet. No indeed. I ran to the
corner drugstore and bought a‘ bottle of Lister-
ine.-Itwasn’t going to be 501 . . no sir.

Several weeks later, signs and newspaper
ads authoritatively‘ announced that there only
umpteen “shopping days until . . .” The ads,
you’ll remember, didn’t say until what. I
checked my handy little’ pocket calendar
against the umpteen‘ shopping days remaining
and rushed out to buythree more bottles of

Listerine. I wasn’t going to have people say-
ing I was 501 behind my- back.

In the past couple of weeks, over-sized, multi-
colored question marks- -have appeared on bulle-
tin boards hither and you aroundthe campus. Here,
at last, we have a dance committee which is honest
if nothing else. The question marks indicate that
they too don’t know what's b going on. This makes
the confusion unanimous. "

I Kaufmann’s department store didn’t help. our
cabalistic problem when their “IIOOTW” signs
were pasted throughout the county. After the 501
epidemic, L was certain Kaufmann’s was warning‘
me against becoming “1100 This Week.”
Yesterday in the ground ﬂoor locker room
I discerned a. large red poster with the white-
letters “JN--PIA.” *

Move over, Noah, here I come.

Hits First Snag

Student Congress has given newly-formed Pitt Chest Council
the job of getting'Wilbur Irvin Newstetter, Dean of the School of
Applied ‘Sciences and director of, Red Cross drives in Pittsburgh
colleges, out of an embarassing position.

came the revelation. Pitt has}
withouttlie knowledge of the Red
Cross, adopted th.e Pitt Chest Plan
which has the aim of eliminating
drives by single organizations
like the Red Cross and substitut-
ingxone campaign for all organ-
izations’. ,
Congress To Decide

Student Congress, in any case,
will have to make the ﬁnal deci-
sion on whether the Red Cross
will be -allowed to conduct a sep-
arate campaign this spring. But
they, have referred the matter to

favorable recommendation on
Dean Newstetter’s report (that the
Red Cross be allowed their sepa-
rate campaign this once), for a
more careful consideration.

Unair. To Red Cross

Besides upsetting the Red Cross’
well—laid campaign plans, Dean
Newstetter pointed out, the Red
Cross also got unfair treatment
because its national policy did
not permit it to aﬂfiliate with oth-
er organizations. “It would be un-

fair,” said Dean Newstetter,” to .
expect the Red Cross to change ‘

national policy on such short no-
tice.”

the hecklers bombarded Miss

Said Father O’Brien, “I wit-
nessed the whole affair and saw
no evidence of physical violence

tend to laugh off the affair as
trivial ridicule while the Pittites
issued a statement stating’: “ . . 
this action was in direct violation
of American civil liberties which

was branded as “mob violence" as
carried out by “a hoodlum minor-

Offered Coeds By YW

“If winter comes, can spring be far behind?” And if spring has
come, summer jobs must be just around the corner waiting for you.

This year the National Intercollegiate Christian council is
bringing multitudes of opportunities. to American students.

Positions in camps, industries,

ters religious centers, and cooperatives are just waiting for the stu-

dent with a free summer and a

governments, social service cen-

desire to learn while they earn.

To acquaint Pitt students with¢
the details and beneﬁts of these
offers, the membership commit- _
tee of the YWCA is holding a
mass meeting for all students in
the Metropolictan, Y. Tuesday,
March 2, from 6 to 8 p. m.

The program will be in the
form of a panel with speakers

offering summer employment. A_
long question period will follow,
and application blanks will be
passed around.

Prominent among the opportu-
nities open to students is the
Washington Student Citizenship
seninar, where students hold full-
time paid jobs in government
agencies and spend 8 to 12 hours
a week in seminar meetings. It
lasts for ten weeks, beginning
June 21.

Chicago, Ill., Hartford, Conn.,

even aluminum Pogo Sticks.

But mention any other means of locomotion
or transportation and our aluminum “Imagi-

is more logical than vehicles made of aluminum?
Less weight to move. More payload.

religious problems is the New
York College Summer Service
group, which places students in
settlements and unions for thirty
hours a week-

Vacations spent in Estes park,
Colorado, and College camp, Wis-
consin have often encouraged
students to work as employees of

in the sun, workers are able to
make as much as $100, exclusive
of room and board.

Bicycle trips through Europe
are once again gaining popular-
ity with the increase of European
hostels. These trips are usually
undertaken by students who are
not interested in earning .money
during the summer. They pur-
chase bicycles when they arrive
in En-gland, travel around Europe
on them, and sell them when
they return to the states.

Fuller details about the vari-
ous qualiﬁcations and methods for
these summer opportunities will
be given in the-panel Tuesday.

 iExc|usive——Here's Your Complete Coverage;

TEXT OF ATHLETIC REPORT

Full texts of both the report of the University’s Faculty Committee
on Athletics and, the report of Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald's Temporary
Athletic Committee appear here for the first time in

Student-Alumni
print.

Both reports were released to the press early Wednesday morn-

ing by the University News Service.

The temporary committee was appointed by Dr. Fitzgerald during,
last year’s dismal football season to “investigate our athletic policy
to make certain we are not leaning over backwards.”

A Student Congress demand for a probe into the University’s foot-
ball program precipitated the committee’s appointment.

Full Faculty Committee Recommendations

Dr. R. H. Fitzgerald
Chancellor of the University
Dear Dr. Fitzgerald:

In your letter of November 30, 1945 you requested
the Faculty Committee on Athletic Policy to study
carefully any problems which the University may have
pertaining to staff, eligibility, schedules, etc., to report
to the University Senate on general policies, and to the
Administration on speciﬁc problems (of personel and
ﬁnance. Accordingly, on January 15, 1946 the Committee
transmitted to you a report on the football coaching
situation, and on May 23, 1947, it reported to the Uni-
versity Senate on our athletic policy and procedures.
This is, therefore, the third formal report of the Com-
mittee since receipt of your letter.

The opinions and recommendations in this report

i are based on the experience of the Committee during

the ten years of its existence. During the past three
months a Special Alumni-Student Temporary Committee
also has been studying our athletic situation and will,
we understand, report to you. We have held six evening

meetings with this Special Committee and have, as

far as is possible in this time, informed them on our
athletic policy, procedures, problems, etc. We have dis-
cussed with this Committee the desirability of. sub-
mitting to you one joint report, with minority recom-
mendations where indicated, but they have decided to
submit a separate report.

Although our athletic policy was fully explained
in the Committee’s report to the University Senate, a

I copy of which has gone to you and to each'member of

the Special Committee, the following statement of prin-
ciples, basic to this policy, are repeated here:

“a. Intercollegiate teams should be truly represen-
tative of their student bodies and this can not
be unless their members are amateurs.

b. Schedules should be limited to competition with
teams representing schools of similar size and
high academic standing.

c. Insofar as it is possible to predict at the time

schedules are‘ made, each event on the schedule
of each sport should be reasonably even com-
petition in which each team has a fair chance
to win.

‘ d. University intercollegiate competition should be
limited, as far as feasible, to contests with in-
stitutions which abide by the same general prin-
ciples and rules of eligibility as does the Uni-
versity.” -

During the past ten years the University has passe

through three stages in its athletic history. These cor-
respond with the pre-war, war, and post-war periods
of our Nation. In 1938 the Board of Trustees adopted the
“Code for the Conduct of Athletics at the University
of Pittsburgh,” under which we operated until August
1943, when we changed to the war-emergency regula-
tions of -the Western Conference. This change was ap-
proved by the University Board of Trustees upon recom-
mendation by the Faculty Committee on Athletic Policy,
to permit us to conform to the war—time revision of reg-
ulations adopted by colleges with which we compete.
During the post-war transition period we have continued
to follow the rules and regulations of the Western Con-
ference, and have arranged with the Eligibility Com-
mittee” of that Conference to give us‘ its interpretation
of any of their regulations concerning the exact mean-
ing of which we have been in doubt. _

Although, as indicated above, details in our rules

and regulations concerning eligibility etc. have varied

,,considerably with changing national situations, "the

above principles basic to our policy have remained

constant and, in the Committee’s unanimous opinion,

they should not be altered.

In the operation of our athletic program we have,
in general, been successful in conforming to, and at-
taining the objectives of, most of these basic principles.
For example, our intercollegiate teams are composed
of amateur athletes who are truly representative of our
student body; and most, but not all, of the events on
our schedules have been with teams representing
schools of similar size, high academic standing, and ad-
herence to the same general athletic policy. Further-
more, the events on the schedules of some, but not all,
of our teams have generally represented fairly even com-
petition and our teams have won a fair share of the
contests.

In football, however, for several years we have
not been. on ‘even ‘competitive terms with many of the

 

'_ule agreements are completed.

ball games with Penn ‘State and West Virginia. How-
ever, during the same period we have lost all but one
of our games with Western onference teams. Some of
these games with Western Conference teams were
fairly ‘even competition, but others have been very
uneven. Our failure over a period of years to present
even competition with some of the teams appearing reg-
ularly or periodically in our football schedule has been
a matter -of much concern to the faculty, including this
Committee, to the Athletic Department, to the students,
alumni, and other citizens of Western Pennsylvania.
This situation is unsatisfactory and has caused the Com-
mittee to re-study the entire athletic program and its
operation. The remainder of this report sets forth the
results of this study. We list. below the major funda-
mental aspects of our athletic problem, under each, the
Faculty. Committee opinions:
Schedules

If _we are to have intercollegiate football we must
decide on the teams we wish to play and can schedule.
Our basic policy regarding schedules has been explained
above. Within the limits permissible under this policy,
however, selection must be made among the many in-
stitutions with which we may wish to compete. In this
selection care must be taken to continue on our sched-
ules events with (a) neighboring institutions like Penn
State, Ohio'State and West Virginia, which are tradi-
tional rivals, and (b) institutions the contests with
which are of the greatest interest to our students,
alumni and the citizens of Western Pennsylvania. In
most respects, including athletics, Western Pennsyl-
vania is more a part of the Mid-West than it is of the
Eastern seaboard. The Committee is of the opinion that
the majority of the games on our schedules should
continue to be’ with Mid-Western institutions, and that,
rather than ‘seek easier opponents, we should increase
our efforts to make such changes as may be necessary
to meet the Mid-Westem schools on a more ‘equal
basis. 4 .

In addition to Mid-Westem universities, however,
institutions of high standing in the East, like the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Yale, Cornell, Army, Navy and
others, would be very desirable additions to our sched-

ule, and we favor continued efforts to arrange such ’

events. One annual intersectional game, as, for exam-
ple, with some Southwestern or Paciﬁc Coast Con-
ference institution, is desirable, especially if it is ar-
ranged on a home-and-home basis, because of the edu-
cational values. involved and its attractiveness to the
boys on the team, and also because of its national in-
terest. Games scheduled with the expectation of an
uneven contest (the so-called “breathers”) are undesir-
able, yet in the normal ﬂuctuations in the strength of
every team occasional games of this nature are to be
expected, even though they are not planned.

Football schedules are generally completed, or es-
sentially completed, a year or more before the games
are played and late changes are practically impossible.
Our schedule last fall, which was completed about a
year earlier, was, in the Committee’s opinion, too diffi-
cult. In at least the first three games, with Illinois,
Notre Dame, and Michigan, our team did not have an
even chance to. win.

The Director of Athletics, Mr. Hagan, is responsible
for the preparation of schedules, but he is expected to
confer with and receive the approval of the coaches
involved, and with the Committee, before ﬁnal sched-
However, there has
been lack of uniformity in this procedure and misunder-
standings have resulted. Last year, because of such mis-
understandings, the Faculty Committee, after confer-
ences with the Director of Athletics and with some of
the coaches, agreed on a “scheduling procedure” to be
followed in all sports. This agreement was not reach‘ed
in time to inﬂuence last year’s schedule, and binding
commitments on next year's schedule also have been
made without Committee approval. It is necessary in
making schedules that the Director have, within proper
limits, the authority to make ﬁrm schedule commitments
with other Directors. It is equally necessary that the
Director voluntarily keep the coaches and the Commit-
tee informed of his activities with regard to schedules
and that he recognize and conform to limitations on
his authority in completing schedules. This has not been
done. Mutual understanding and co-operation several
years ago might have avoided much of our present
schedule difliculty. The procedure understanding reached
8 Year ago was recognized too late to affect this year’s
football schedule," nor was it followed as a guide in

A , ,vear’s schedule.

   

 

tee is of the opinion that, with such .modiﬁcations as
future experience may dictate our schedules will be
brought into closer conformity with our policy. In an-
ticipation of this the Committee recommends no change
in our football schedule policy except that being worked
out under the scheduling procedure agreement men-
tioned above. We must not forget that athletic rela-
tions with other institutions, like personal friendships,
take years to develop and when broken are difficult to
re-establish.
L Rules and Regulations—Code

Rules regarding those permitted to participate in
a game are as essential as the .rules on the playing of
the game. The rules followed in the playing of inter-
collegiate sports are determined by the -National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and are reviewed,
and generally modiﬁed in some details, annually. There
has been no national body regulating those permitted
to participate in intercollegiate competition until Janu-
ary of this year, when the 'NCAA voted to assume this
regulatory function. Whether or not we belong to any
Conference, we must now abide by the regulations re-
garding subsidization of athletes, recruiting of athletes,
etc., or risk being dropped from membership in the

‘NCAA. Under the present NCAA Constitution, the penal-

ty for not being an NCAA member is discontinuation
from the schedules of member institutions. All schools
with which we do or may compete in football are NCAA
members. NCAA regulations are minimum regulations.
In the opinion of the Commi_ttee, we must conform to
these, at least, if we are to continue in intercollegiate
athletics.

An institution such as ours, which belongs to no
Conference, is at a disadvantage in many ways. ‘» It may
formulate a code of its own, as we did in 1938, and may
carefully abide by that code. If its teams are successful
it is suspected of violating the code, or the code itself
is criticised. If the teams are unsuccessful the code is
suspected of being too strict. Furthermore, as institu-
tions with whose teams it competes modify their regu-
lations ‘(as happens frequently and as was especially
noticeable during the war and the post-war transition
periods) ._it must make comparable changes or be at
an added disadvantage. Party for the reasons mentioned
above, the Faculty Committee is very deﬁnitely of the
opinion that in addition to abiding by the NCAA regu-
lations we must also follow the regulations of what-
ever ‘Conference includes the majority of the institu-
tions with whose teams we compete. This has been,
‘and. the Committee recommends that it continue to be,
the Western Conference. '

In considering the matter of what code we should
follow we should understand that (a) Conferences, like
the Western and the Eastern, differ little in their regu-
lations. We do not make it easier to have a strong team
by changing from the rules of one Conference to those
of another; (b) Other schools, including Notre Dame,
Marquette and Michigan State, are, as we, following
Western Conference rules rather than a code of their-
own; and (c) On the whole, Western Conference rules
are less strict than the code we operated under from
1938 to 1943. - ‘ T '

The fundamental causes of our athletic difficulties
are not in our schedules, although they can and will
be improved; nor are they to be found in the regu-
lations under which we are operating. Our difﬁculties
are caused by .a combination of many factors, chieﬂy
the lack of adequate physical facilities, related to which

are the problems. of ﬁnance, player material. and Ath-

letic Department personnel. These are considered sepa-
rately below.
Physical Facilities and Finance _

Except for a Stadium which has adequate ‘seating
space, the Department of Athletics is badly handicapped,
in comparison with other institutions of comparably

, size and standing, by inadequate physical facilities. This

inadequacy affects every sport in the University’s ath-
letic program: Insofar as football is concerned, the
greatest need is for suitable practice ﬁelds, and this will
become more acute if the hilltop, which is being par-
tially utilized now, is assigned for other use. The gen-
eral lack of facilities operates to\the detriment of the

 

Athletic Department in two principal ways: (a) It /

makes more difficult the coaches’ work with those on
or trying for the teams, and (b) It fails to attract many
capable students interested in athletics, whether or not
they are already in the University. Our coaches, like
our professors, have in varying degrees succeeded de-
spite such difﬁculties. The degree of success has varied

with the" individual coach’s (or professor’s) determina-
tion, enthusiasm, "ingenuity, etc., and his ability to
impart enthusiasm and optimism to others. Mr. Fesler,

thusiasm and determination, and he~imparted these at-
tributes to others, despite the limited facilities. In
general, our football coaches in recent years have been
less successful in this regard than the other coaches,
like Mr. Olson, track coach, and Dr. Carlson, basket-
ball coach. In part, this may be a result-of the greater
public attention given the football team and its suc-
cess or failure. ‘

' A ﬁeld house, such as has been proposed,'wi1l'aid
our general athletic‘ program, including football, but
it will by no means be a complete cure for the total
facilities handicap. It can, like the Stadium‘, b_ecome
another University problem if care in its planning is

P not taken -to avoid mistakes in this - regard that have

been made at other institutions. It probably is idle to
give further consideration to the facilities problem here.

I The Committee realizes that the University Administra-

tion is making progress in improving our entire physi-
cal plant, including the portion used for athletics.
Finance and facilities are related. The athleticpro-
gram and the paymentson the bonded Stadium in-
debtedness are ﬁnanced by receipts from games, ‘es-
pecially from football games. Fortunately, these receipts
have sufﬁced to meet the cost ofour athletic program
and to reduce the-Stadium debt. However, they have
_not been sufﬁcient to clear the Stadium of debt, toiim-
prove our facilities, nor to expand‘ the athletic pro-
grams. Our athletic facilities are being used in the in‘-
tramural and physical education programs o‘: the Uni-
versity and have also been used to the detriment of our
, athletic program‘ for outside activities, such as the Civic
Light Opera. The; Committee understands that we can
not accept rent for the use of the Stadium because of
the tax liabilities this would incur, but a thorough in-
quiry into this possibility has not been made. The Com-
mittee recommends that the University Administration
make a study, supported by reliable legal opinion, to
determine what rent or other income, without general
tax "liability, could be derived from the‘ use of the

Stadium for events‘ other than those nowscheduled there-

by the University. A ,
Player ‘Material (Subsidization and Recruiting)
Many capable athletes, including some All-American

‘ fo_o,tb’all's'tars, have. gone from Western Pennsylvaniato’

distant in schools. Independent of athletic considerations
many, probably‘ ‘most, of these would ordinarily and
properly have come to ' the University for their edu-
cation. On the other hand, it is unusual for a‘ promising
football prospect to come from distant states or dis-
tricts to the University. These contrasts are not limited
to athletes, as they occur also in other departments of
"the "University. I  ,

Many considerations influence a ‘boy’s choice of a
college. If he happens to be a football star it is unfair
to him and to the school to which he goes if we infer
from the mere fact of his going, for the athletic glori-
ﬁcation of the school. On the other hand, it is reliably
reported that many promising athletes ‘who would nor-
mally and properly have come to our University have

been induced to go, elsewhere. It is also evident to ‘the’
_ Committee that in some of -these instances the boy's edu-

cation and his usefulness as a citizen of Western Penn-
sylvania have thus» been impaired. The Committee ' is

not the opinion that, to the best i of its ability, the

University is obligated to extend to the citizens of West-
ern” Pennsylvania the ‘best educational opportunities
possible, including legitimate assistance in the giving of
scholarships,_ jobs, ‘etc., awarded on the basis of need
and ability.

With respect to- prospective athletes, ‘one of ‘our
Vdiﬁiculties has been that we have not had enough legiti-

‘ _mate sources of aid, and as desirable jobs, to offer them.

If we are to interest the outstanding athletes in the
high schools of this district, we must be able to‘show

‘them how it will be possible for them to attend the
University of Pittsburgh, obtain. a good education, and

vparticipate on our athletic teams. This. calls for a
speciﬁc job program. Our situation‘ inithis regard has
improved considerably in the past year, as about 25
desirable jobs in the University have been made avail-
able to athletes. .

The Committee is of the opinion that, as far as
football. is concerned, our problem" of “aid to athletes”
"would be solved and be in conformity with the word-
ing and the spirit of both the NCAA and the Western
Conference regulations, if about 60 desirable jobs, sim-

ilar to the '25 now held by athletes, were available to‘,

football players. Additional jobs for athletes in other
sports are also needed.

In the Committee’s opinion, the responsibility of
directing the search for sources of desirable employ-
ment for athletes resides in the Director of Athletics.
‘Assistance. in this matter is expected also from the
coaches, as in other departments it is given by pro-

fessors, and the University Placement Bureau. The alum- '

‘ ni and other interested citizens of Pittsburgh also could
. help- ' ,_ ’

There has apparently been some misunderstanding
outside the University about what forms of ‘ ﬁnancial

point are clear, but too lengthy to quote here. Copies‘

of these regulations are in your possession and have
been given to each member of the Special Committee.
The Faculty Committee is responsible for the interpre-
tation and application of these regulations and, when
in doubt, it can receive the interpretation of the NCAA
Constitutional Compliance Committee or the Western
Conference Eligibility Committee. ‘Our difficulty regard-
ing ﬁnancial aid to students who are athletes comes
largely from failure eﬁectively to follow up all poten-
tial sources of legitimate aid, and to set up a deﬁnite,
workable, job program. _

Recruiting of athletes is practiced in one form or
another by most universities that have athletic teams.
Persuasion and solicitation of athletes to attend an edu-
cational institution are not to be condemned, provided
the means employed are similar to those used generally
to enlist/the interest of prospective students. Precise
separation of permissible from improper recruiting is
not easy to make, and conferences differ greatly in their
regulations concerning this matter. Practices such as
that of alumni sending prospective athletes to the col-
lege campus for talks with the Coach or Athletic Di-
rector are entirely permissible. Last year Mr. Fesler
addressed high school banquets and on these occasions
he emphasized the-importance to the athletes of Western
Pennsylvania of their enrolling in the University ., of
Pittsburgh for their education and participation in ath-
letics. This is an illustration of, legitimate persuasion
of athletes in this district to come to the University.
In solving our problem of player material, we do not
need to send “talent scouts” into distant areas to persu-
ade promising athletes-to come here. To do so would
be contrary to our policy. We do need, however, to

‘ protect ourselves and the athletic youth of this district

by giving them full educational and athletic opportuni-
ties jhere. Moreover, through University publicity chan-
nels, alumni, high school coaches, teachers, principals,

'etc. they should be informed of these opportunities.
Fundamentally, it is not the problem ‘of the Athletic.

Department-alone to do this, _but it -shouldbe aggressively
active in a program of legitimate promotion,

We are of the opinion, therefore, that the_ imme-
diate solution to our problem of bringing to this Uni-

. versity more of the promising high school athletes of

Western Pennsylvania lies ( 1) in setting .up a speciﬁc

‘program of desirable jobs‘, available to students who are __’

athletes. It is the responsibility of the Director of Ath-
letics to see to see that this is done,.to check with the
Faculty Committee on questions of policy regarding any

job in question, or to inform the Committee why such-

a program can not be put into eﬂ.’ect..lThis Committee
opinion was explained to the Director of Athletics about

a year ago and the has made» considerable -progress on A

such a program; ‘ (2) co-operation ’ between all parts
of the University and its alumni. and friends in inform-
ing the athletic youth of Western Pennsylvania of the
educational and athletic opportunities at the University.
V Personnel  4
Faculty Committee on Athletic Policy; The members

of the Faculty Committee are appointed by the Board

of Trustees upon the recommendation of the Chancellor_

of the University. There vwere seven members on the
original Committee formed in" 1938. The primary re-
sponsibilities of the Committee were (1) the administra-
tion of the Code on Athletics and (2) the athletic rela-

‘ tions between the University and other educational in-

stitutions. The Committee » was. poorly. informed and

"had no responsibility in, matters of athletic department

budget ‘and personnel, but concerned itself principally
with questions regarding, eligibility, awarding of letters,
etc., until .it receivedyour” letter of November 20, 1945.
In that letter personnel and finance were included

' among the athletic problems on which the Committee

was requested to make a study and report. It is the
C9mmittee’s present understanding that it has respon-
sibilities in.-the formulation and execution of «policies
affecting every phase of the University’s athletic pro-
gram, and that the line of authority is from the Di-
rector of Athletics through the Committee to the Chan-
cellor and the- Board of,Trustees. A ,

‘ During the two years that the Committee has had
these added repsonsibilities it has devoted its atten-
tion to the football situation until, under Mr. Fesler’s
leadership, it improved. Then, during the 1946-47 school
year, it studied the track situation, scheduling, budget
procedures, and other Athletic . Department problems,
and prepared a report to the Senate of the University.

While, these studies were in progress our Head Coach, ,,

Mr; Fesler, resigned to accept the head coaching posi-
tion ‘at Ohio State, his Alma Mater, and Mr. Walter
Milligan, who had been our Line Coach under Mr.
Fesler, was appointed Head Coach.

These studies were designed to improve and
strengthen our entire athletic stiuation, and to bring the
Athletic Department procedures into conformity with
general University policy and procedures. The studies,

_p1us routine Committee business, have necessitated fre-

quent meetings during the past two years. Although
occasional special meetings in addition to the regularly
weekly meetings have been required during this period,
it is the Committee’.-. opinion that when these studies are
completed, monthly meetings will suﬂice.

 

    
 
  

fact that similar unsatisfactory situations developed peri-

odically during the ‘preceding eight years. The Com-

mittee has, however, frequently considered the possible i
desirability of changes in its organization and, on No- .

v/ember 19, 1947, voted that, as a part of the study of
which this is a report, it, would recommend changes in
the Faculty Committee on Athletic Policy to provide
for: V ‘ I
(1) Representation for Alumni and Students as
_ Committee. members -
(2) A deﬁnite plan of term of service of Committee
members _
(3) Some plan of closer relationship with the Uni-
. versity Senate " v

The Committee agreed on the desirability of these.

changes, pr_ovided Faculty control is retained and, _ on
November 20, 1947, informed the Special Committee of
these _ Faculty Committee opinions.

Athletic Director: The Athletic Director is respon-

sible for the direction of the University’s athletic ‘pro-

gram, under " the authority of the Faculty Committee

on Athletic Policy. His, administrative position is com-

parable to that of the Head of a Department of the
University, like the Head of the Chemistry Department,
who, under the authority of the Dean of The College,
directs the activities of his Department. The ‘coaches

and other personnel of the Athletic Department are_

under the authority of the Director, just as professors

and other instructors are under the authority_ of the . ~

Heads of the Departments. This is true faculty ‘super-

vision of athletics, provided the Committee is controlled 
by faculty gnembers. I W o

Recommendations, suggestions and; requests, orig-
inating Vwith coaches, players, students,‘ alumni and
other channels through the Director of Athletics to the
Committee. The Director need transmit to the Committee
only such requests and recommendations as require
Committee action. Recommendations concerning the
budget and budget changes channel from,,othe Director,
through the Committee, to the Chancellor for decision,
but details of expenditures within the budget are ‘ad-
ministered by the Director. These relations and pro-
cedures were not in effect until’ about two years ago,
but they are in harmony with similar relations. and pro-
cedures in other . departments of the _University.

The responsibilities of the Director are more num-
erous and varied than we shall attempt to discuss here.

' Thetvariety of his responsibilities calls‘ for a requisite

amount of versatility, ability, and a readiness on his
part to accept and fulﬁll the obligations imposed by
his. position. , e _ _

Mr. Hagan became Director of Athletics in 1937;

During the ten -‘years of his regime we have regularly \

‘played football schedules,;prepared by him, in which

our teams contended" with strong opponents,‘ including,

many Western Conference teams. ' On the whole, our

contest record against these teams is unsatisfactory‘._

Four timesduring this" period our ‘Head Football Coach
has resigned. In theselection ‘of -newol-leadi,. Coaches and
other Athletic Department personnel, Mr. ‘I-Iagan’s rec-
ommendationshave beenfollowed. The facts mentioned

above are generally known. It is natural, therefore, that‘
. in the minds_ of many. Mr. Hagan is I considered 'to'“be

the primary reason for; our athletic diﬁiculties. In,,,the—

opinion of the Faculty ‘Committee, the problem is not »

thissimple. The Committee further believes that while

Mr. Hagan has been quite successful in; the fulfillment V ,‘—'
of some of his ‘responsibilities, ' he has failed to_ recog- 
nize, has neglected, or at least has ‘failed to accomplishil V
"s the satisfactory’ fulﬁllment of some of his other duties.

In view ‘of the facts and opinions ,outlined_ above,

and after long study of cthisﬁsituation, the Committee rec-I
,ommends that Mr. "Hagan be asked by the Administra-

tions to prepare a complete organizational chart of the

Department of Athletics, ‘together. with a job _ analysis ~
for each, member of the Department. The -Committee be-:-' in
lieves that if ‘this is ‘done-to the satisfaction and mutual .
understanding of "all members of the; Department, the 
.morale and efficiency of the entire Department will im-,
prove. The Committee recognizes that such:an”anlysis;
is equivalent to a "request.-for more time and informa-
tion for this phase of its study, but it feels _justiﬁedg~
in that we are convinced that _no hasty change involv-L .
ing the ofﬁce of the Director will rectify the present:

athletic situation. , ,

Head Football Coach: Although it is customary. in
most institutions to ascribe to the Head Coach more
than his share of. thevcredit for the football teams’ suc-
cesses and more of the blame for itsfailure, it is un-
questionaly true that to him is rightly ascribed‘ much

of the responsibility for the. record. Releases of foot-

ball coaches because of poor seasons are frequent, ‘and

this practice brings discredit upon the institutions in- '

volved. With’. full realization of this fact, however, it
_remains the duty of the proper authorities to determine

what is best for the institution in each situation and to I , 

act accordingly. In this spirit, the Faculty Committe
has studied our football coaching problem. Our stu _

has consisted principally of personal observations ‘dat-“‘§"_

ing from the time Mr. Milligan came to the University
as assistant to Mr. Fesler. Such observation, which ‘is
a routine part of, Committee responsibility, has been
intensiﬁed during the ‘past year. ‘Committee «member
have ‘held many private conversations with individ "
in the Faculty, ‘membe , of; —-the Athl ‘c if

On the. basis’ of v all the information in our possession
the Committee is unanimously agreed that:
, 1. Mr. Milligan is a sincere, loyal and co-operative
»Vg"entleman. He is popular with those who know him and
””‘th‘e Committee fully shares this feeling toward him.
i’ 2. Mr. Milligan’s work as Head Coach has been. be-
low ‘theestandard that we are justiﬁed in expecting,

theschedule was ‘very difficult. This should not be in-
. terpreted, as. a Committee ‘criticism of Mr. Milli~gan’s
igtechnical football -ability nor of the fact that all but
one of the game were lost. It does mean, however, that
in the Committee’s opinpn he has failed to deinonstrate
the qualities of leadership, imagination. and enthusiasm
_ necessary for the position of Head Football Coach at
the University of Pittsburgh. ‘

  
   

  

 
 
  
 

. In, addition to the above ‘statement of Committee .

opinion, Mr. Hagan has informed theVCommittee that
in his opinion our Spring practice period will be very
unsatisfactory and that, if we go into ‘next Fall with our
present football" coaching staff, we shall be obliged to
makefa change in the position of Head Football Coach
beforethe season is over. The Committee. recognizes that,
although this is only a prediction on his part, it is a.
possibility. .. » _
e The Committee is of the further opinion that if
Mr. ‘Milligan should resign now the would receive from

L Mr. Hagan hasrecommended to the Faculty Com-
, Fmittee that “Mr; Milligan be asked‘ to resign from; the
Aviposition of Head Football Coach.” »
The Faculty Committee on Athletic Policy
ymously concurs in this recommendation.

of the meeting of theoNational Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation, held in New York City January 9, and 10,
1948. The Mayor was quite concerned over the letdown
in the athletic, performance of the University and en-
thusiastically pledged his earnest support for .the re-
habilitation of the athletic program at Pitt.

The procedure agreed upon with the Faculty Com-
mitteewas that the report of the -temporary committee
of six. would be transmitted to the Chancellor of the
University, and a copy sent to the Faculty Ccxnmittee
on Athletic Policy for its study and such comments as
it might wish to make concerning this report, before
referring the report «to? the Board of ‘Trustees of the
University of . Pittsburgh. It was also ‘agreed with the
Faculty: Committee that no information would be given
to the public press until the ﬁnal report was submitted
to the Board of Trustees. ‘A

Two, additional meetings have since been held by
the temporary committee for the purpose of discussing
the testimony and printed matter» received by the com-

, mitteeI.' After careful, conscientious and objective study

and-’ discussion‘ of'the information received by the Com-
mitte'e,¢-the following conclusions’ and recommendations
are herewith submitted.

.- 1. Athletic ‘Policy

It is clearly evident that for approximately the last
ten years there" has - been a fundamental inconsistency
-inthe, athletic policy. Although, the University admmi-
stratio publicly" announced‘ that athletics were to be

‘ de-emphasized,‘ there, has been no de’-emphasis in the‘

character of athletic opponents -who. have been consist-
ently appearing on the schedule during that period. This

i has been particularly true of the two major sports, viz.,

football andbasketball. In fact, instead of de-emphasis,
the trend, in so fareas major opponents are concerned,
has. been the other way.’_ The -inequality o‘f~~the man-
power of the University of-Pittsburgh to the manpower
of its _opponents has been demonstrated by the string
of humiliating defeats by major’ opponents, both in
footballiand basketball.‘ For example, infootball, more
and more contests have been "scheduled with members
of the‘ Western Conference. The result of these one-
sided contests is too well known to students, faculty,
‘ alumni and the citizens of’-Pittsburgh to require com-
ment. It has meant, one victory.in football for the" Uni-
versity of a» Pittsburgh. in something like twenty—ﬁve
meetings with Western Conference football teams. The
informationgatherecl by the cdmniittee leads to the in-
evitablé conclusion that the University administration
has practiced de-emphasis and economy on the side of
attracting talented high school athletes to the Univer-

sity by a strict and .most stringent interpretation of the’

various codes and regulations of the’ Conferences a_nd
Associations to which its opponents belong, but has fail-
ed to exercise comparable discretion in schedule—mak-
ing. The committee recognizes that the stadium indeb-
tedness and operating costs have no doubt inﬂuenced the
Athletic Department of the University in selecting
athletic "contests which would provide large gate re-
ceipts to meet these ﬁnancial obligations; nevertheless,
it is: clear that this ‘inconsistent policy has been fol-
lowed "a‘t‘”th’e expense. of P the ‘players who were over-

Committee

this interest item is a capital expenditure. It is respect- 

fully suggested that-a specialcommittee might well study

‘the problem of the ﬁnancial burden" of the stadium. It

is,_therefore, the studied conclusion of your committee
that the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees of the
University of Pittsburgh must ﬁrst dVeCid&e‘OI1"a~d€ﬁ’I'l.-V
ite policy with respect‘ to the type of schedules" which
it, desires tomaintain. If it elects to meet major op-
ponents (which seems to be the unanimous desire of
all those interviewed by the committee),'it must provide
the organization, facilities and proper inducements, with-
in the bounds of propriety and a realistic approach, to
attract_athletes.of promise to the University‘. ' C _.V
If, on the bther hand, the University administration‘
should decide that _it wishes to deﬂate its inter-col-

legiate athletic. competition by not «making any particu- V
lar attempt to ‘attract to the University high school stu- ‘

dents, of athletic attainment, then the University's sched- -5

ule ghould be deﬂated accordingly. ' g
It is the speciﬁc recommendation of your commit-

tee that the University ‘of Pittsburgh should offer‘ ‘de-

serving athletes tuition, books. and provide job op-7

portunities which will allow a student with athletic» I

ability to meethis board, room and incidental living ex-'
penses. It is further recommended that these job op-
portunities should be ~ provided by the ‘University, in
order that’ the hours of work may be so regulated that ‘P
the student may be relieved of work requirements dur-

ing the football. season and spring training, football/C

practice period, or in, the case of any other sport, fo_r .

-. the period when practice requirements make it an

undue hardship upon the student to compete because
of inability to ﬁnd suﬁ*1c,ient hours in the day for class-

room study, practice. and work., Arrangements "should in

be made whereby the student can make up his‘ job
hours at other periods of the year when the particular

sport in which he competes does not require his atten- «CC

tion. It is understood that the athlete must "keep. up
his scholastic requirements at all times. His ‘primary

purpose should be to get an education. Tramp athletes

or special classroom_ standards for a student simply be-_
causehe is an athlete are to be condemned.

II. Schedules A

The matter of making the football schedule oreth  I

schedule of any competitive sport fit the student ath‘-‘
letes available for participation in those sports should
be given consideratibn. We have already indicated that
we believe the football schedules and, almost to the
same degree, the basketball schedules ‘have been com-
pletely out of line with the ability of the teams‘ pre-
sented by the University to play those schedules. Depend-
ing on the decision of the University administration as
already discussed under “Policy,” the schedules should
be either completely de—emphasized or, if the conclusion
reached is to continue to play major opponents, a sched-
ule should be made realistically to give our teams an
equal chancel until the gmaterial a ailabl i C in: e

ules be lightened until the material matches the sched-
ule and brings victories in some fair ratio to defeats.
If ,the victories and available material increase, the
schedules can be made proportionately harder.

III. Organization

The present organization for administering athletics
within the University‘ framework is unsatisfactory. The
Director of Athletics’ reports to a Faculty Committee on
Athletic Policy, consisting of six faculty members se-
lected by the Chancellor of the University and approved
by the Board of Trustees. In the past this approval
by the Board of Trustees of the recommendations by

the Chancellor to this committee has been perfunctory. It i

seems that this Faculty Committee did not function ac-
tively until the Fall of 1945. Prior to this the administra-

tion of athletics was conducted by a committee chaired
by the Secretary of the University and the Director of

> Athletics. Since the Fall of 1945, however, the Faculty

Committee has gradually been taking unto itself not
only the legislative functions in connection with the ad-
ministration of Pitt athletics, but it has assumed the
powers and functions ' of an administrative group. Its
meetings are held almost weekly and usually last sev-
eral hours. It meticulously passes upon and controls
small matters of administrative detail. The procedure is
cumbersome‘. Requests are made to the Committee by the
Director of Athletics in triplicate; the Faculty Committee
then meets and deliberates and replies to the Director
of Athletics in triplicate. Often matters arise which re-
quire the prompt and effective decision and attention of
a responsible head. Instances have been brought to the
attention" of a responsible head. Instances have been
brought to the attention of your investigating committee
where, because of this detailed and delaying procedure,
the need for action has passed long before a decision is
forthcoming under the complicated routine now in effect.
The committee therefore recommends that the present
Faculty Committee be abolished and that in place there-
of there be established a University Committee on Ath-
letic Policy, whose personnel shall be selected as fol-
lows: I
4

’ the Senate for a term of four years each, with

each member’s term expiring in successive years;

3 Alumni members, each for a three year term
expiring in successive years and chosen as fol-
lows: #1 by Alumni Council, 1 by the Board of
Trustees, and 1‘ by the Varsity Letter Club;

2 Student members chosen‘ by the Student Con-
gress, one to be a junior and the- other, a senior;
the junior’s term of ofﬁce to be for two years.
The Director of Athletics shall be the Secretary
and a member ex ofﬁcio of the Committee, with-

. out a vote. . -

It is suggested that membership on this Committee (ex-
cept in the case of the student members to whom the
limitation is not applicable) be limited to two successive
terms and that vacancies occurring on the Committee
be ﬁlled by the parent. organization charged with the
selection where the vacancy occurs._

This University Committee on Athletic Policy should
function in a legislative capacity. It should not need to
meet more than four. times a year for the purpose of
deﬁning policy, approving budgets, awarding University
letters, etc. The Faculty members within the Committee
membership should be solely responsible for athletes’

eligibility. This University Committee on Athletic Policy

should, by no means, lose. its legislative characteristic
by attempting to become an administrative body. The

administration of its policies should’ be vested in the V

Director of Athletics or some other employee, who
should ‘be chargeclr with the duty of carrying out .the
policies as ﬁxed by the University Committee. The Di-
rector of ‘Athletics or any other comparable officer or
employee should be given authority to make decisions in
line with the designated policy, without the necessity of
constantly requiring approval from the University Com-
mittee. This suggested organization is in line with good
business practice and should cure the delay in decision
and the cumbersome administration which is now part
of the athletic setup at the University. It is the feeling
of this _ committee that a great deal of the bad press
which the University has suffered over the last decade
has been due to this lack of responsible authority and

the resulting surprising inconsistencies in statements

which have appeared in the press from time to time.

IV. Director of Athletics
It has been _a matter of deep concern in the course
of the committee’s investigation as to whether or not

_ the apparent confusion, lack of coordination between

   

coaches and the Athletic Director, lack of good will
between the University of Pittsburgh and high schools
and of a genuinely friendly attitude between high school
coaches and the Athletic Department of Pitt are based
on fact or are merely the product of rumor and gossip.
After painstaking attention to this particular part of our
study the committee has reluctantly reached the con-

clusion that there is a deep-seated and extensive lack V

of friendly cooperation between many high school

.1'= n4 

Members of the University faculty, chosen by-

University of Pittsburgh, which is a deterrent to at-
tracting talented high school athletes to the University
of Pittsburgh. The same vigorous opposition to the Ath-
letic Department is clearly a factual thing among many
Pitt alumni. Whether or not thgse attitudes are entirely
justiﬁable, it is very evident that .the situation is an
unhealthy one, and constitutes a deﬁnite obstacle to the
rejuvenation of the Pitt athletic program. Although ac-
cepting the de—emphasis policy of the University, the
Director of Athletics has complete failed to maintain
satisfactory public relations and achieve results. The
committee’s majority view, after long and careful de-
liberation, is that it would be to the best interests of the
University of Pittsburgh to replace the present" Director
of Athletics, Mr. Gow dissents (see footnote).

“I strongly disagree- with the recommendation that’

the present Director of Athletics be replaced._ In my
judgment the present Director is a victim of rather than
the author of the University’s athletic difficulties. I am
firmly convinced that throughout much if not all of his
tenure the conditions under which he has had to function
have denied him a full and fair opportunity to demon-
strate that he has the capacity and talents required for
the post of Director of Athletics. It is‘ my view that he
is entitled to an opportunity to work under the improved
conditions which should result from the University’s
acceptance of the other recommendations of this report.”
-—J Steele Gow. *

V. Football Coach

Some evidence was presented to the committee _that
the present head football coach and his staff did not‘do
a capable job, this past football season. There can ‘be

_no doubt but that the morale of the "football players ,

was very low at the end of the football -season; that
the record of one victory in nine starts was one of the
poorest I1 Pitt history. However, after considerable at-
tention to the football coaching problem it is the opinion
of the committee that the head coach and his staff are
deserving of a furtherchance to demonstrate their abil-
ity. The style of football played in the year ‘1946 under
Head Coach Fesler was abandoned for the single wing
form of attack that had been the style of football used
at the University of Pittsburgh since the days of “Pop”
Warner. This change, together with the hardest sched-
ule in Pitt history and the circumstances surrounding
the sudden departure of Coach Fesler, created problems
which could not be handled easily. Over the past de-
cade, l\/fr. Milligan represented the fourth head coach.
It is easy to put the blame on the coaching staff when
a poor season is experienced, but the committee is sat-
isﬁed that merely _“ﬁring a football coach” is not the
solution to the athletic problem at Pitt. Rather, the prob-
lem is far more deeply—seated and can be cured only

‘by, attention to the various topics of discussion which

have combined’ to create a program of failure.

VI. Physical. Facilities ‘

Practically all witnesses interviewed by the com-
mittee agreed that the physical facilities for a success-
ful athletic program’ at the University of Pittsburgh
are inadequate. The football practice ﬁeld is not of
regulation size, is not kept in good condition and is too
small an area for the purpose. of accommodating a nor-
mal football squad. There seems to be a woeful lack of
adequate and satisfactory football equipment, and ac-
cessories for the Freshman Squad. For the most part,
housing conditions of the athletes are not good. Atten-

tion should be given to equality .of job opportunity, so

that athletes who need ﬁnancial assistance may procure
better quarters and everyday necessities which will en-
able them to become a part of the fraternal and social
life of the campus. The present conditions make it almost.
impossible for these students to join fraternities or live
in fraternity houses, and as a result, they are more or
less isolated from campus contacts. Medical attention and
facilities for the physical ailments of the football squad
are generally good, although athletes in other sports
seemingly must yield to ﬁrst consideration for the foot-
ball players. The members of the track squad have no in-
door facilities for practice, except the Trees Gymnasium,
which is too small and in poor condition. The track
house, which was used extensively by the track men
before the war, has been allowed to disintegrate and is

now in such poor condition that it is unuseable. The only

available indoor track facility is Schoonmaker Hall at
South Park, which is 16% miles from the University
Campus. It is a» great hardship to ﬁnd enough student
automobiles to transport the track men back and forth
to this facility for practice, as well as a great time waster.
No buses or University transportation is furnished. The
only outdoor track available is at the Pitt Stadium.
This track is in poor condition. It has, no concrete curb
and is an adverse reﬂection on Pitt, according to the best
available information. Further, the dressing facilities are
inadequate, as the track athletes must use the visiting
team dressing-room and vacate the same each week, so
that the visiting team may take over. The personal equip-
merit, for’ the track men has also been inadequate, as in
the case of the football players.

, With respect to basketball, it has been generally
known for many years that the basketball court at the
Pitt ‘Stadium is too . small and generally very unsatis-

 
 

   
 

tthe

committee that the lack of facilities and equipment
generally in the athletic program of the University of
Pittsburgh is in keeping with the attitude of the Uni-
’versity administration in failing to provide ample means
for a deserving athlete to attend the University or to
provide him after he gets there with‘ the type of facili-

ties, equipment and cbndition sthat is so necessary for the
bulldlng of happy ,enthusiastic and winning morale.

VII. Public Relations

The evidence heard by your "committee results in
the conclusion that there is a keen need at the University
for better public relations for the athletic program with
the press, the high school coaches, alumni and the friends
of the University; that much better selling job could
and sholild be done to create a favorable press and to
stimulate and» correlate worthwhile publicity in such
a way as to make the public conscious of a great. Uni-
versity which should be patronized and generally sup-
ported by Western Pennsylvania and the tri_-State area.
é'I‘his is admittedly a territory where there is an outstand-
ing caliber of high school athletes. A selling job must
be done to make theml conscious of the opportunities
of matriculating at the University of Pittsburgh, close
to their own homes.

It is recommended that a graduate manager of ath- .

letics be appointed to serve under the Director of Ath-
letics and be speciﬁcally responsible for creating and
maintaing effective relations between the Athletic De-
partment of the University and the athletic departments
of secondary schools and with the ,University’s alumni.

VIII. Summary of Recommendations
I. Athletic Policy "

I. Decision should be arrived at by the Chan-
cellor and the Board of Trustees on a deﬁnite poli-
cy with respect to scheduling major opponents or
minor opponents. , j

schedule of opponents commensurate with the ma-
terial available, so that our team shall have an equal
chance of winning. - S
III. Organization.

1. The creation of a University Comittee on
Athletic Policy, consisting of nine members and the
Director ‘of Athletics, who shall be Secretary and
member ex omcio, without a vote. This committee

~ because of the unsatisfactory and unfavorable rela-
tions with high school coaches and alumni.

all branches of competitive sports must be rectified.
VII. Public Relations. -

1. Public relations have been poor and detri-
mental to a successful athletic program. _

2. The appointment of a graduate manager of
athletics to serve under the Director of Athletics and
to be speciﬁcally responsible for effective relations
between the Athletic Department of the University
and athletic departments of secondary schools and
with the University alumni“ is. suggested.

IX. Conclusion

It is our sincere hope that the recommendations
contained in this report will be carefully considered by
the Chancellor of the University and the Board of
Trustees. The committee realizes that the job ahead,
to put the Pitt athletic program ogn a sound and work-
able basis, cannot ‘be done rover-night, but that with
careful and realistic planning and a practical approach
to the problem, a businesslike, efficient organization can
be readily formed to handle one of the necessary and
vital parts of a university's life. Your committee is ‘con-
vinced that attention to the suggestions contained in
this report will start Pitt on the road back to a popular,
sound and desirable athletic program.

playing a little over half of the
game, totaled 37 .points between
them. Leo Skladany, customarily
a high scorer, shot only once or
twice and failed to connect.

Season Undefeated

The next step for Ben Grady’s Pitt natators is the Eastern
Collegiate championships at Rutgers University, March 13. The mer-
men concluded their dual meet season undefeated Wednesday with
a 59-16 triumph over a Davis and Elkins team that, was hopelessly

outclassed.

In the events where Grady c-n—¢

tered two men, they took first and
second. Where only one was en-
tered: he captured first place.

The meet was climaxed when
four men, a distance star, a back-
stroker, a diver, and a breast-
stroker were entered in the 400
yard free style relay, an event for
four free style sprinters.

M Grant Bows Out

Grady’s assortment took the
event in remarkable time consid-.
ering the circumstances.

Mike Levine, top distance
swimmer, and Bill Grant, second
man in the backstroke, each won
an event in their collegiate dual
meet ﬁnale. Both seniors, Levine
copped the 220 free style, and
Grant the 200 yard backstroke.

Dick McKee, ordinarily the
second man entered in free style
distance events, was the top scor-
er with a ﬁrst in the 440 free style
and a second in the 220.

Frosh Called Out
Casting an eye toward the fu-

ture, Ben Grady announced fol-

lowing the meet that freshmen
enrolled in the University with

_ any swimming and diving ability

may report now and work out.

Coach Grady is available at the
Trees Gym pool daily from four
until six o’clock.

West Virginia’s recent basket-
ball victory over the Panthers was
recorded with the Mountaineers
having possession of the ball
slightly more than one-third of
the 40 minute duration of the
game.

Dr. H. C. Carlson's possession
style offense had the spheroid 57.9
per cent of the time, and the Mor-
gantown uint 36.3 per cent.

The unusually small number of
jump balls, 11, consumed 4.2 per
cent of the time, while the clock
accounted for the other 1.6 per
cent by running overtimewhen
time outs and fouls were called.

The ball changed ‘hands 163
times, or very slightly over four
times per minute on an average.
Of the 11 jump balls, the Ice
Cream Eaters gained possession
six times.

During the ﬁrst four minutes of
the second half, the Carlson Car-
avan tallied ten points to two for
the visitors, but both teams had
the ball an eual amount of this
time.

Home Season

By Donald Giﬂin

\V'est.niinster drops in to-
morrow iiight to help I’itt close
its home basketball season and
the result. should be iiit.erest-
ing. More often than not, the
towering Ti't.ans provide the
unexpected.

Grover C. (Pappy) Washa-
baugh’s quintet, a hot and cold
club, have cooled off too often this
year to be considered among the
top—ﬂight teams around. In fact,
they have been classified as “one
of the ten most disappointing
teams in the country.”

Two weeks agothe Panthers put
an ice—cream chill on the Titans,

~ . 68-62, at Farrell but this doesn’t

mean a sure win for the oasied
Caravan tomorrow.

The New Wilmington team
poses a threat to the Carlsons with
their 65 - point - a - performance
scoring. The recent return to
form of Chet Dembinski, last
year’s Tri-State scoring champ,
hurts Pitt’s chances for a repeat
triumph. " - ‘

Five players In the game boast
scoring totals of 200 or more.
Pitt’s Dodo Canterna (222) and
Sammy David (221) have been
staging a ding-dong battle here.
Dembinski, Bruce Wagner, and Al
McCullough are doing virtually
all the tallying for Washabaugh’s
tall boys.

This trio and the Jones broth-
ers, Tom and Jack, should start
for”Westminster, making the ar-
ray four giants and a midget. The
little courtman is Jack Jones. only
a ﬁve—and-a-half footer but ex-
ceptionally fast.

Bill McLhinney and Don Hed-
dleston, a pair of veteran seniors,
are sure to see action in the melee.

A study of the Westminster
lineup indicates that the Titan tilt
should be much like the West Vir-
ginia duel last Friday. and that
was a thriller. . T

Independent Association Cifers
Haven to Unaffiliated Students

Pitt’s nomads, those students<>

who lack the ‘social and fellow-

ship contacts to get the most out

of their college career, have a
good oasis on which to pitch their
tents in the Pitt Independent as-
sociation.

“Too many students come and
go at Pitt without knowing more
than two or three other students,”
said Ray Plusky, president of the
association. PIA feels that with
its general meetings and frequent
social gatherings, members will
get to know one another and ﬁnd

.new pleasure . . . at Pitt.”

PIA plans to sponsor
functions; provide a medium of
expression of student opinion; and
foster loyalty to the University.

PIA’s first event is touched
with the mysterious and is open
to all students and faculty. Dr.
Peter Gray, acting head of the
biology department, will speak at
Stephen Foster Memorial at 3:30
pm. Wednesday, March 3; what
he will talk about he just won’t
say.

' After the assembly a tea will be
held in the Commons Room.

It intends to’ cooperate with other
student organizations and the Uni-
versity administration to achieve
these aims.

Plusky presented a plan for the
many who have been missing out
on those events that make a school
life. A full social calendar of
dances, hayrides, and s p o r t s
events is being pushed by a spe-
cial social committee.

“In short, the Pitt Independent
Association offers a well planned
program which will give its mem-
bers a new social status and an
increased interest in their Uni-
versity,” Plusky stated.

 Varsity Dubious

(Continued from Page 1)
the two Committees. The Faculty
Committee did not call in the
players for an interview, and al-
though the Student-Alumni Com-
mittee interviewed team mem-
bers, the players claim their views
were given scant consideration.

“We still feel,” they said, “our
views should have been given
more consideration in the ﬁnal
recommendations.” Despite the
intensity of their statements, they
are doubtful whether anything
they say will have much effect on
Pitt’s tottering athletic adminis-
tration.
