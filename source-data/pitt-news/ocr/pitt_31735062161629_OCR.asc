Wherein Seer
Rackoff Takes Last

Peek Into Crystal

By HERBERT RACKOFF

As voting machines are un-
veiled this morning and 1nulti-
colored slates ﬂood the campus,
today ’s election‘ ‘appears to
have taken  new in
the way of a~.._c,omp,lection.

What sta " , _i;,g.,,to be a ple-
biscite in fat? Tdf ‘a huge Inde-
pendent—Dent-Fraternity c l i q u e
which apparently included almost
everybody on campus has become
more or less of a contest.

It has developed that there were
at least 11 or 12 Independents who
have decided to buck the campus
power, and try to squeeze in for
themselves. Led by insurgent
Brooks Sipes and voluble Jackie
Hoeveler, the new clique will try
to beat out at least 10 coalition
candidates, prevent the contem-
plated clean sweep.

Will they succeed? Hell, No!

To the uninitiated, this might
seem a rash prediction. In fact,
I’m staking my entire future (if
any) as a political prognosticator
on this statement. Anyway, while
I’m at it, I might as well go whole
hog.

 

RETURNS LISTED

From a complete survey of basic
voting power as well as a knowl-
edge of gravy to come, here’s the

this afternoon. The names are

W'ith that war—cry_, both the ,great Independent-
Dental-Fraternity coalition and the self—styled_ Inde-
pcndent-Independents open battle this morning 1n
an attempt to control results of the University general

elections.

Balloting for offices in Studeiit-Faculty Association, Col-

‘lcge Association, and Men’s Council takes place today from 9

to 5:30 o’clock in Memorial Hall, after a campaign reminiscent
of preparations for a totalitarian plebiscite.

Students who penetrate the

crowd of slate—distributors on

Memorial Hall steps, ﬁnd that their blue election card is on ﬁle, and
push buttons for their favorite candidates on the County-loaned vote
machines will be contributing toward one of two results:

1. A possible clean sweep of

all SFA, CA, and Men’s Council

ofﬁces by the powerful Independent—Dental-Fraternity (which should
be read backwards) coalition, the ﬁrst unanimous victory ever to be

scored in the history of University politics.
A possible break in the Coalition lineup by the Independent-

Causing the plebiscite atmosphere in the election campaign are
the apparently bright prospects for success of the highly-organized
Coalition, dimmed only slightly by the last—minute plans of the Inde-

pendent-Independents.
If election results of past years

1200 and 1500 votes will be cast in today’s election.

may be taken as criteria, between
If this is the

case, between 190 and 200 votes will be necessary for election to an

SFA seat.

Coalition leaders Les Hamburg, C38, Phi Epsilon Pi; Al Barr,

BA38, Phi Kappa; and Ernest Rose,

D38, SFA President, believe that

they have arranged ﬁve slates—composed of fraternity men, inde-

pendents, and Dents—which should

gather at least a basic vote of 200.

On the other hand, Independent leaders Brooks Sipes, C39; and

Jack Hoeveler, C40, have hopes of

Gathering enough votes from the

non-fraternity element to push through two slates to capture 12 SFA
seats for the dyed-in-the-wool Independents. :

This situation accounts for the rush by both parties to skim some
votes from the 75 per cent of the student body who have no fraternity

afﬁliations.

Additional non-fraternity votes for Coalition candidates

will insure complete victory, while a concerted swing of non-fraternity

students toward the Independent

candidates will give them some

chance of breaking the Coalition slates.

Reasoning of the Independent

leaders is this: “The Coalition»

slates _are assured of almost enough votes to put them in, while we.

must build support from the ground.

Baseball         
With Intramural Tournament

League Play
Year Establishes
Ground-Work

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor ,

‘With an ’ announcement by
James A. Hagan, director of
intramural
baseball tournaxnent would get
underway the beginning of
May, the ﬁrst step in the revivi-
fication of the diamond sport into
a major campus athletic activity
has already gone past the for-
mulative process.

Starting out this year with the
first organized campus baseball
venture since 1924, when the team
was disbanded, the athletic de-
partment issponsoring what is ex-
pected to be an all-inclusive in-
tramural tournament.

It is the acorn planting from
which a varsity baseball oak will
grow. The tournament, sched-
uled to be in session every day
during May, will serve, more or
less as a “san.dlot search for big
leaguers.” From the standout per-
formers in this tourney will be
drawn the personnel foundation
for next year’s varsity.

ENTRIES DUE MONDAY

Student response to the athletic
department’s intramural blue-

prints will be expressed in thel

next few days as the team entry
blanks are received. An entry
deadline has been set for Monday
at 4 o’clock. At that time there
will also be a meeting of all team
managers in the athletic offices,
27th floor, Cathedral.

Any method of team organiza-l
tion is permitted and the indica-l
tion now is that there will be any 
number of diversely-classiﬁed;
campus divisions represented inl
the diamond set-up. The various 
schools of the University, such as 3

the Medical School, the Engineer!

ing school, and the department of
physical education have started to
get teams together.

GAMES AT STADIUM

Each team entered will have a
baseball-experienced f a c u l t y
member as coach. Games are to
be played in the Stadium, start-
ing every day at 5:30 o’clock with
a daily menu of two games, and
it is expected that each team en-
tered will have the opportunity of
playing at least seven games.

A baseball diamond, comparable I

in size to the various major
league parks, is being laid out in
the northwest corner of the sta-
dium field by Frank Mecca and
his Stadium ground-crew. Work

on the diamond was started Tues- 1

GOVERNING _ . -B

A governing board has been es-’~.
Jtablished to condu

‘rules, interpret them and have ex- '
‘elusive charge of the play. It is
"composed of Dominic Cupelli,
3'3orIner football manager; Al Barr,
former varsity football manager;
Harvey Rocker, director of intra-
mural athletics; Jack Schricker,
boxing coach; Frank Carver, di-
rector of athletic publicity; and
Leonard Levison, sports editor of
the Pitt News.

Fencing Tourney

Pitt Men’s “Y” club will be the
scene of a fencing tournament to
be held tonight at 8 o’clock, in
their club gym at Forbes and
Bouquet streets.

The tournament is
and no awards are to be made
but Richard Montgomery, of the
University Fencing Club, who has
charge of the tournament feels it
will provide students with an op-
portunity to gain experience in
public fencing under tournament
rules.

An Editorial

7- HEN a college man uses the adjective “swell,” he’s liable
“ to mean almost anything.

VVith that in mind, we think it ’s just swell that political
parties on campus are lined up the way they are. After the votes
have been tallied this afternoon, we will have discovered that a
state of almost complete unanimity exists at the University. In
fact almost every vot'er willfhave voted for members of the same
great “Popular Front.’ ’

This is swell, we think, not because ithas saved so many
people so much ‘worry ab nt who ’s going to get elected, but
because it will automatically bring about the greatest possible
crisis in the life of student government at Pitt.

Before this year, the school was in two camps, and each
claimed that the other hampered its possible progress. But that ’s
a thing of the past.

Tomorrow the student government association will be com-
pletely uniﬁed under one flag. (SFA will then have the choice of
two alternatives:

1. It can try to make some sort of progress toward solving
real student problems, failing which it must resign in pro-
test.

2. It can stand still, as in the past, in which case the student
body must demand its abandonment.
That ’s why We think it’s swell.-

get practically everyone on campus to vote. Only in this way can we
get enough non—fraternity votes to push some of the Coalition candi-
dates out of the picture.”

Condition of the weather is another factor which will affect
chances of the Independents. Rain is likely to keep many of the
lukewarm non-fraternity voters from the Memorial Hall polls, while
bad weather should have slight effect on the organized fraternity and
Dent voters.

'1/Veather reports, however, favor the chances of the Coalition, for
the prediction is “partly cloudy, and cooler, with probable showers.”
Heavy showers will cut deeply into the Independent vote total.

Analysis of the slates prepared by the Coalition shows that .18 of
the 30 candidates represent groups which were originally parts of the
fraternity party, which won last year’s election. Of the 12 Coalition

 

Names   elm

Edward J. Helm has been se-
lected by a special faculty com-
mittee as the outstanding senior

On the two SFA slates being pushed by the Inde-

Women who did not align themselves with the Coali-

dependent group placed him on their "slate without
his “knowledge or consent.”

Voting for SFA will be done on the Voting ma-

e Z I Think . . .
Editor, The Pitt News:

Something has happened. People are beginning
to talk about Men’s Council. Could it be that the
objectives sought by the more aggressive candidates
are being taken seriously? Could it be that stu-
dents are getting the ideaas to what Men’s Council
is and should do to better conditions around the
campus?

Anything can happen. Maybe some students will
get out and vote for candidates seeking election to
the Council. Maybe some will ask candidates if
they have a platform, or are running “for the fun
of it.” Maybe the Council can be ﬁlled with enough
progressives and independents to constitute a work-
ing, not a shirking, majority. Maybe I’m an ideal-
ist. The results of the election will tell.

Being as fair as possible, the fraternities and self-
styled independents have used ‘subterfuge in this
campaign.‘ They have never given all "individuals
the. right to criticize"; they have never chosen the
best men for all committees--witness that only
fraternity men are dance chairmen; and certainly
fraternity men, representing several hundred stu-
dents cannot represent any more. ’

Their desire to expand the University program is
sheer talk, and they will conduct another poll on the
transportation problem, announce that 1 students
should get cheaper rates, then fold their-hands and

say, “Too bad, too bad.”

These self-styled independents and fraternity men
will represent thirteen fraternity houses and a
handful of tired independents, and no more.

VV‘e, the Independent party. members, assert:

1. We will attempt to make student government
more useful. V . V

2. We will maintain an intelligent, fair,‘ and co-
operative attitude at all times.‘ V ‘ ' ' .

3. We will appoint to ohﬁ’ice,anyi person-—-fr,ater-
nity, self-styled independent, or independent--who

really deserves the appointment.

4. We will never stoop to condemning any or- V

ganization, merely because“, it happens to disagree
with us. .

5. We will do work in regard to lower street-
car fares, a Student Union building, eating facilities,
extended cultural and athletic activities for all stu-
dents, not just those who can afford to pay their
house dues.

When we feel that we have failed, we will resign
any positions. .Meanwhile, we solicit intelligent
votes for the two independent slates for Student-
Faculty Association,‘ and ourgeandidates for Men’s
Council and College Association.

Head Of PCW
Speaks Here

The annual Ohio Valley Re-
gional Conference on Adult Edu-
cation moves into its second ses-
sion at noon today with an ad-
dress by Dr. Herbert L. Spencer,
president of Pennsylvania College
for Women, in 132 Cathedral this
noon.

Dr. Spencer, who is also a
member of the executive board
of the Pittsburgh Council on
Adult Education, will speak on
“How Does the Present Crisis Af-
fect the Ethics of Government?”
Several other speakers will be on
the same program, which will be
led by Dr. S. P. Franklin, head
of the department of religious ed-
ucation at the University.

 

l The horsepower of one type of electric clock motor is
 eleven millionths H.P. A dynamometer made in the
Westinghouse Research Dept. has accurately meas-
ured and plotted this fact.

The ﬁrst ofﬁcially scheduled radio broadcast was that

I. of the Harding-Cox presidential election returns, sent

Pa., on Nov. 2, 1920.

l\/Iodern high-efﬁciency Westinghouse-equipped gener-

out over Westinghouse Station KDKA, Pittsburgh,

ating stations produce a KWH of electricity on 1 lb.
of coal, base load. The national average for 1937 was
1.43 lbs. In 1922 the ﬁgure was 2.5; in 1927, 1.75; in

1932, 1.5.

Some of the Westinghouse elevators in Radio City,

1 believed to be the fastest in the world, travel at the
'; speed of 1400 ft. per second.

The largest all-electric—welded building (tonnage and

floor space) is the 12-story Central Engineering Labo-
ratory building of the Westinghouse Electric 85 Mfg.
Co. at East Pittsburgh, Pa.

The greatest advantage of alternating current, as

recognized by Geo. Westinghouse more than 50 years
ago, is the facility with which its voltages can be
stepped up or down for various needs of transmission

 01' 1186.

Oliver B. Shallenberger, a young engineer with the

Westinghouse Electric Co., discovered the principle
in 1888 and developed the ﬁrst A.C. watt-hour meter.
It has been basically unchanged to this day.

Micarta is a laminated synthetic resin material, devel-

oped by Westinghouse and having many desirable
electrical and mechanical characteristics. It is used
for insulation, bearings, bushings and many industrial
purposes, as well as for decorative work of all kinds.

Electricity costs about % less today per KWH, on

the national average, than it did in 1913. It is one of
the few commodities that has steadily decreased in
cost during these 25 years.

10.

Hydrogen has been found to be a better cooling

medium than air, and 10 out of the last 14 large 2-pole
3600 r.p.m. generators use it. Westinghouse pioneer-
ing led to this improvement.

Watch for another interesting “Electrical Quiz” i.n a
coming issue of your college publication. Electricity is the
greatest single force in this modern age. Learn more about
it — and about the companies, like Westinghouse, that
put it to doing the world’s work.

To Hear Press
Staff Writer

Continuing the series of voca-
tional talks planned by the dean
of Women’s office for freshman
women, Maxine Garrison, who
was graduated from the Univer-
sity in 1934 and is at present on
the staff of The Pittsburgh Press,
will speak Monday at 3:30 o’clock
in 121 Cathedral.

Miss Garrison will have as her
subject “Personal Equipment
Needed for Positions in Journal-
ism and Advertising.”

Four of the twelve vocational
meetings for freshman women
have already been held. These
have been attended and according
to reports from coeds who partici-
pated, have been quite proﬁtable.

Planned to supplement Orien-
tation courses, the meetings were
instituted also as an aid for ﬁrst-
year women who will make up
next year’s schedules in May.

The Publications Unit, which is
in charge of Monday’s meeting,
extends an invitation to all fresh-
men, women interested in adver-
tising or journalism to hear Miss
Garrison’s talk.

drawn from fraternity members
or independents, according to the
rules released by Miss Franklin.
One selection is to be sung by
each group entering the Sing,

the group giving the best perform-
ance. Groups wishing to enter
