(See editorial, Page 4) 

Two students have told The Pitt News

that the Pittsburgh Police would not at

all be capable of controlling a truly vio-
lent situation. ‘

Wayne Williams, a freshman from Ne-
wark, N.J. said that “if the Pittsburgh
Police were forced into situation similar
to Newark, sheer bedlam would break
out.” ‘

The Newark, N.J. freshman described
some of the reactions of the enforcement
officials during the Newark riots. “I saw
the police and the National Guardsmen
have bottles thrown at them, bullets fly
past them, and abuse after abuse hurled
at them. The heckling there was drastic.”

 

The reaction of the police in the quad-
rangle, however, was not at all similar to
the law enforcement officials in Newark,
according to Williams.

He said “the obsenities hurled at the
police by the students were not even com-
parable to the obscene remarks made by
the police. This po-int,” said Williams,
“doesn’t jive with Supt. Slusser’s state-
ment that the students were makinga
great many abusive remarks to the police
officers.

Williams and Dennis Cohen, a fresh-
man from Philadelphia, both felt that
many of Slusser’s recent statements on the
disturbances were erroneous. The students
heard Slusser’s statements on a radio

 

Cohen took offense at some ‘of the
Superintendents remarks. Slusser stated
there were no malicious beatings '1\1es-
day, according to Cohen. But the Phila-
delphia fre-shman told The Pitt News that
he saw one of his good friends “severely
smashed on the head with a billey club."

Slusser allegedly said that the police
put down some of the mob like acts and
that the Tuesday night disturbances were
a riot. As before, Cohen claims that these
statements were erroneous. “I wouldn’t
call the events of Tuesday night a riot."

Both Williams and Cohen stated that
they saw a student who had mace sprayed
into his eyes. “Slusser denied on the radio
broadcast that mace was used,” said Wil-
liams.

Dean Kehl Announces
Graduate Placement

Office Now Established 

by JOHN CAYWOOD

The University has now established the Post-Bacca-
laure Educational Services Office.

Dean James Kehl. who has headed the organization of
this office, explains the idea behind it: “Many students in
the College of Arts and Sciences are interested in graduate
and professional study, and it is an appropriate responsibil-
ity of the College to provide the information and counseling
services needed by its students for proper guidance in such
pursuits. In other words the office would assist the student

interested in gnadwate or pro-
fessional study .in the same way
that the P-lacement Office as-
sists those interested in secur-
ing positions.”

The College now provides such
services for pre-medical and pre-
dental students. 'llhose in:teres't-
ed other ﬁelds must work
through the department in one
particular ﬁeld, or search the li-
brary on their own without spe-
cialized help.

In addition to making admin-
istration-student relations much
more personal, Dean Kehl sees
the new program to be of mbst
beneﬁt to the less outstanding
student, to whom the most pres-
tigious graduate school would
be closed. These students will be
able to find good but less well-
known graduate schools, where

they will" have a chance to prove
their academic ability.
Co-ondinsating the ‘program at
the outset will be Mrs. June Ru-
bel, a member of Dean Keh-1's
staff. Mns. Rwbel has been Wllllh
the University for  years. She
worked «in several other a.-dmin-
-istrative Ipositions before she be-
gan working with Dean Kehl.

Mrs. Rubel has done adminilstria-’

tive Wonk required to get the
program going. Working with
Dean Kehl, she has sent letters

to a.p1p»roxirm.-atelly 450 unliverws-i-’_‘[

tiles to request inf-orma't»ion on
more than 3,000 gnaiduuate pro-
grams.

The office, to be located on
the ninth or tenth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, will offer six main
services:

> A reading room with a com-
plete collection of graduate and

medical programs'. All these will »

be in one location, and upper-
cl-assmen will be able to bnowlse
through them. Someone will be
available at all times to help stu-
dents or to refer them to pro-
fessors speciallly acquainted with
a particular ﬁeld or school.

> A student dossier ﬁle. serv-
ice. Through this office the stu-
dents will be given tips on how
to develop their dossiers to best
indicate the abilities they have
and to best recommend them to
he schools of their choice. A stu-
dent will be able to start a ﬁle
in his sophomore year by col-
lecting letters of recommenda-
tion from professors he gets to

  Students Endorse Kennedy

,  Ruskay States Purpose

To affirm for the basic direc-
tion of -their April 23 primiary
campaign, University Students
for McCarthy announced th-eir
additional endorsement of Sen-
'?ator Robert F. Kennedy. The
chairman of the new Students
for McCarthy, Kennedy ognoup,
John Ruskay, issued the follow-
ing statement:

_, “The issue here is not, as the
President would have it, be-
tween the two admirable men
who have come forward to op-
pose the war; it is rather be-
tween those who believe that di-
plomacy is the extension of sur-
render by other means and these
two men.”

A He pointed out, "Their object

A’ and ours is t-o prevent the re-

noméinativon of Lyndon B. John-
son.

“Our primary here in Pennsyl-

. vania is particularly important

to this national effort. It is the

ry and the first in the large, us-

It is to be these boss-eontroled
states that Lyndon Johnson looks
to for uncontested and undivided
delegations and this ﬁght will
only be won if we find ways of
getting our sentiments express-
ed the polls and at the conven-
tion,” Ruskay said.

Ruskay remarked, “No peace
candidate in this century has

ever been rejected by the voters.”

Ferlinghetti To Read For IPF

The International Poetry For-
um will present Lawrence Fer-
linghetti in a reading of his own
poetry, April 3 at 8:30 p.m. in
the Carnegie Music Hall.

Tickets for Ferlinghetti’s read-
ing are available now at Gim-
be1’s, Kaufmann's, Horne’s and
the University’s Student Union
(SU) Desk. Additional informa-
tion concerning the reading can
be obtained at the International
Poetry Forum office in the Car-
negie Library.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti has giv-
en many poetry readings both in
this country and abroad, includ-
ing the Spoleto Festival, the Ber-

_lin Literary Colloquin and a poe-

try evenings at the Royal Albert

Hall in London. He has written
film scripts for avant-garde pro-
ductions and his plays have been
widely produced in college thea-
ters.

A Coney Island Of The- Mind,
Ferlinghetti’s second book of
poems, may well be “the best
selling poetry volume of our
time,” says Karen Falkenhan of
the Forum. His other works in-
clude Starting From San Fran-
cisco and Pictures of the Gone
World, books of poetry, and Rou-

tines and Unfair Arguments With
Existence both ventures into “un-
conventional, revolutionary thea-
tre,” according to Miss Falken-
han.

Ferlinghetti, after completing
his doctorate at the Sorbonne, set-
tled in San Francisco where he
and Peter D. Martin founded the
first all paperbound bookstore in
the country, “City Lights.” Un-

Dr. Farnsworth Discusses

Children and Mental Health

by BRUCE LEVENSON

“Good intentions do not guar-
antee successful mental health
for our children,” warned Dr.
Dana F. Famsworth, in a lecture
given last Wednesday at the YM-
WHA in Oakland. This lecture
was the latest in the series deal-
ing with “Community Mental
Health and the Human Potential.”
Dr. Farnsworth feels that the
communication gap between par-
ents and children must be nar-
rowed so that an adolescent can
“achieve a sense of oneself.”
“The children," he cites, “have
rejected their parents as being
out o-f touch.”

Dr. Farnsworth sees a “gener-
al frustration in the structured
meaning of the lives of the adol-

escents." They are "unconfioeut,
unsure, and doubting.” The par-
ents, who view their children as
extensions of themselves, fail to
consider them as individuals in
their own rights.

Youthful discontent, according
to Dr. Farnsworth, is generally
valid. “Today’s protesters are
our best children. They are the
best informed and make the best

grades.” Youth is objecting to the V

“the establishment.”
Hypocrisy, social injustice, and
society's concern with appear-
ance and material wealth, which
is all epitomized by the war in
Vietnam, can no longer be toler-
ated. “The Vietnam war is pro-
moting more hatred than any oth-
er single factor.” ‘

lice force apparently prompted students to reassem-
ble in large numbers and, again, traffic was obstruct-
ed. Police officers cleared the streets and moved stu-
dents back into the dormitory area. Then, acting on
what proved to be a false report that a police officer
had fallen in the midst of the crowd, the police en-
tered the dormitory quadrangle, and from this point
on there was mounting confusion and ill feeling.

The entry of the police on University property is
within the full legal rights of po-lice authority to quell
disturbances at their discretion. This is a point that is
widely misunderstood. However, the entry‘ of the po-
lice last evening was made without the request and
without the prior knowledge of University officials.
We feel that the timing of the arrival of the police in
force, though perhaps justified as an emergency pre-
cautionary measure, served to exacerbate the situa-
tion. Throughout these events, the mood of the stu-
dents was without malice, although the presence of
the crowd was disruptive and many students acted
illegally and irresponsibly in blocking traffic and in
throwing debris.

Police Superintendent Slusser and Assistant Su-
perintendent Kelly behaved with concern for the pub-
lic interest and were cooperative with University offi-
cials were able to establish contact with them.

Regrettably, there were a number of incidents of
culpable behavior and use of abusive language on the
part of both students and individual oplice officers,
based upon substantiated observations of University
officials on the scene. In certain instances, officers
over-reacted to the conditions and used force that was
quite unjustified. A number of students performed
illegal acts, but a number of the 29 students appre-
hended by the police did not do so.

In sum, I believe that this very regrettable situa-
tion was a case of some illegal and some innocent stu-
dent behavior followed by escalating reactions by po-
li'ce in what was meant to be a sincere effort to pro-‘
tect the public safety.

For the future, we will review our procedures for
handling such situations to insure that we are doing
everything possible to cooperate with students and
city officials in preventing recurrences or in bringing

about their peaceful resolution.

A Police Problem

We have found that a basic cause of Tuesday
night’s serious incidents was the noticeable feelings
of hostility between the city police and the students.
Unfortunately the recent statements of Police Super-
intendent Slusser have indicated that he hasn’t rec-
ognized this problem.

Supt. Slusser criticized Chancellor Posvar’s state-
ment on the spring disturbances. He indicated that
the theory of mutual escalation was “hogwash.” Aside
from criticizing a number of points in Dr. Posvar’s
statement, the Police Superintendent denied that mace
was used, said that no malicious beating had taken
place, and that the students were on the streets when
the police went into the Quadrangle.

By calling Dr. Posvar’s theory of mutual escala-
tion hogwash, Supt. Slusser reveals the one sided na-
ture of his perceptions. We can not agree however,
with his platitude that all police officers are God's
gift to justice. The events of Tuesday evening cer-
-tainly discount this belief.

We feel that Supt. Slusser’s statements were
made to cover-up some of the serious errors made by
the police in their failing attempt to maintain order.

‘ Mr. Slusser denied that mace was used. But The Pitt
News was in contact with the student who was the
subject of this abuse. The superintendent said the
streets were blocked when the trouble started. But
all of our reporters and even some of our University
officials told us that this was not the case.

The most serious and far reaching erroneous fact

' was that a policeman had been attacked in the Quad-

rangle. It was this false statement that initiated the
police assault into the campus area.

Even with all the erroneous revealed, the Super-
intendent remains adamant. He still maintains that
the police were merely fulfilling their duties; that
the police were justified. We must say that the city
police were dead wrong and were indeed unjustified
in their actions. They were not the heros of the night;
they were for the most part the i-nstigators.

But this is all in the past. What about the fu-

ture. How will the city police handle future disturb-
ances ?, Will they be able to control a city ri'ot? Will
they over-reac-t to a truly violent disturbance?

These questions provide us with gloomy conclu-
sions for if the city police react to violent disturb-
ance in the same abusive manner that we were wit-

’  nesses to, bedlam wi'll surely break out.

In the interest of future safety, we demand that
the city police and Supt. Slusser admit their mistakes
and learn from their errors instead of always paint-
ing a pretty picture of the policeman.

What Does Number Four Want?

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Outside the Number Four police sta-
tion, it was calm and the night air was
gently cooler than it had been before. It
was ten minutes to midnight; and Wednes-
day.

The trees, one on each side of the entrance,
stood skinny and bare. It was winter but it was
also Spring’s Eve.

Inside, the overhead fluorescent lights were
bright, and made brighter by the ﬂat and white
plaster-tiled walls. The brightness and whiteness
seemed to add dignity to the place, but it also made
one feel uneasy.

THE PLACE WAS filled with uniformed police,
several Pitt students, including a WPGH reporter
with a tape recorder, and one long-haired girl sit-

. ting in a corner to the left of the entrance.

She was the only girl among the 27- students
detained by the police, after the melee. No one
was allowed to speak with her, so she sat nervously
lighting a cigarette.

“Psst,” she said to the Pitt students sitting on
a brown wooden bench near the girl. “They’re de-
nying me my rights." The students chuckled; and
she smiled innocently.

TWENTY MINUTES passed, forty minutes pass-
ed. Two men, representatives of Pitt fraternities,
had phoned fraternity houses to elicit funds for
bail money if needed. A couple of Pitt students
had been joking with the police sitting on the right
side of the room. The girl had given her naine and
address at the head desk; it was indicative of what

' Mr. Jack Critchfield and Mr. Edison Montgomery

had said earlier in the evening.

“I felt frustrated,” said Montgomery, who tries
to keep students out of trouble. He had attempted
to dispel the huge throng two or three times. “I
didn’t know what to do.”

Students inside the paddy.

CRITCHFIELD WAS at home, 14 miles away.
He was Working on his dissertation. “I didn’t think
this would happen tonight,” he said. “I thought it
would be Friday night.”

Suddenly from a hallway, off from the main
room, Dr. Wesley Posvar appeared. He had been in
conference with police since 11:30 p.m.

“Everything is okay,” said Dr. Posvar, who was
dressed in a tuxedo and who had left a dinner
party at his home.

JUST THEN, the police radio blurted out an-
other disturbance in the precinct. A sergeant turned
to an off-duty patrolman. “Want to go along?” he
asked.

“Sure . . . why not,” said the patrolman, as he
slapped his left hand with his billyclub.

More To Come? It Depends

Significant Analysis Of The “Second Annual...”

by DAN LIGHENSTEIN

The most significant com-
ment made when Dr. Posvar
spoke to Tuesday night's
gathering was a wisecrack
from a ' student. Speaking
through a. bullhorn on ‘the Tow-
ers’ desk, Dr. Posvar apologized
three times for being late. for
the festivities. He then said,
“This is . . ." when a student cut

in With, “The second annual . . .”

rum WIS-E CRACK had sig-

niﬁcance because of its validity.

Tuesday night’-s riot was indeed
-only the second annual and
probably only the first of this
spring. Th-is form of having fun
and -blowing off steam is in our
blood now. And, after Tuesday
night, we the students have a

grudge against
the city police
which means a
worse time for
them if they
d-on’t learn
some lessons on
student riot
control before - , _ 
the heat and  3
grind of ﬁnals LICHENSTEIN
week.
The city police would do well
to learn from the University
employees. Pnobably because
the University police know the
students and their moods, they
acted with perfect aplomrb and
effectiveness Tuesday. They stood
and watched the original panty
raid without making a move to
stop it. They let the riot die
down a number of times until
the city police a-rrived and ag-
graved the situation.
THE UNIVERSITY police
know that no one will get hurt

 

   
  

in a panty raid unless someone
stwbs his toe leaping for a pair
of ‘pink silk panties. They also
know that if a few city police
can keep the students off the
streets, everyone will be bored
and go ‘home once the silk stops
ﬂying.

Such was the case the ﬁrst
time the students ﬁled out onto
Fifth Ave. The sight of one
Pittsburgh cop sent the crowd
scurrying into’ the quad. Bill, a
good-niaturred University police-
man, saw a city cop with his
nightstick drawn. He cursed him
and suggested to vnearby stu-
dents that the city cop -could do
something with the nightsticks
which would greatly interfere
with his personal hygiene. Bi‘ll
realized the effect that night-
sticks can have on crowd-s.

The disturbance lost its mo-
mentum and begin to die. A mob
scene must have a cause no
matter how in-signiﬁcant: girls’

underwear, blocking streets and
traffic, combating city police.
When just one policeman chased
the large group from Fifth Ave.,
when girls stopped iparting with
their panties, and before the
masses of city police arrived,
Tuesday night represented a dis-
organized gathering of students
simply making noise.

Even after a few students
were viciously clubbed and
thrown into paddy wagons the
second time the group moved
onto Fifth Ave., the police had
done a too-adequate job of quell-
ing the riot.

Then the false ﬁre alarms trig-
gered the real violence. A ﬂash
alarm is a stupid and potential-
ly a dangerous happening. And
the ﬁre department acted with
a stupidity and immaturity that
far outdid any student action
The ﬁremen left shortly after-
wards, but not after playing
with their over-esized squirt gun

and attracting many more Stu-
dents and policemen.

THE FIREMEN’S spraying
the crowd -barely damped a few
students, but it led to all -the
rock throwing and sulbtsequesnt
police charges. It massed stu-
dents and police again in one
spot. It illicirted student reac-
tion, the brunt of which was
borne by only the police.

There will deﬁnitely be more

outbreaks, probably during ﬁn.

als week, and certainly next
year. If -the city police charge
15 again like the British -at Bala-
clava, they'll be the target of
more catcalls and stones, and
they'll take their needless re-
Venge with their nightsticks.
But if they learn to surround
the campus and keep students
within the Quad, the next riot
will die naturally with no cas-
ualties other than a few bras
and panties.

Five Matmen Enter Nationals
Adams Hoping for Surprises

Dave Adams’ wrestlers are out to surprise a few people this
weekend at Penn State in the ‘NCAA mat championship. The
varsity grapplers finished an amazing fifth in the East two weeks ago.
and Adams thinks this trip is a worthwhile one.

“We’re hoping they can get some valuable experience in the
tournament.” said Adams about his three undergraduate entries. “And
were hoping they’ll do as well as we think they can.”

At the last minute. 137-pound-
er Ron Schuchert had to be
scratched from the grapplers’ en-
try list becasue he hasn’t yet re-
covered from an injury suffered
in the Easterns.

Those still available for com-
petition are seniors Dick Shildt
(123), and Terry Hoover (191) and
sophomores Bruce Unangst (115),
Paul Allen (177) and Tony Truitt
(heavyweight). Truitt did not
wrestle in the Easterns.

“Tony's inexperience could hurt

him very easily.” guessed Adams.
“But that’s why we’re taking him

— for the experience the people he —

meets. "

Adams emphasized that his boys
were in for arough time.

“We’re not going up there for»

a picnic,” he commented. ‘‘We’re
going to the best we’re capable.”

Heads Defense

It was difficult for Adams to
say which of his wrestlers would

have an easier time. 2 anyone at A

the nationals could have “an easi-
er time. “

"It's real tough to say how any-
body will do until I see‘the en-
tries." offered Adams. “As to
who‘s the toughest in the weight
classes. guys shift their weights
around. They try to outfox each
other. and many times just out-
fox themselves.”

Earlier, it was thought Unangst
might have a fairly easy time
placing at 115. Adams wasn’t so
sure, and he listed the competi-
tion. .

“There’s Rick Sanders of Port-
land. a two-time champ at 115, al-
though he‘ may go at 123.” began
Adams. “UCLA has a good boy.

Sekanovich New Coach

by ROY JACOBS,Sports Editor

Spring practice is still gour weeks away, but football still
manages to worm its way into the local sports news. Last week
head coach Dave Hart announcdd a major personnel switch which
should bring about some interesting changes in the Panthers’ defense.
Taking the job as defensive line coach and overall co-ordinator of

the defensd is Dan Sekanovich. who is leaving his job as defensive
coach at the University of Connecticut. Sekanovich also coached golf.

. Sekanovich’s basic philosophies of defense are simplicity and rep-

ition.

“Anytime you speak about defense-,” says Sekanovich, “you have
to get one basic defense you work from. But, regardless of what we do,
we’ll be dealing with simplicity and repetition, repetition being the

mother of learning.”

While the new coach believes in the need for one basic defense.
he is not yet formulated what form that defense will take. Having only
arrived last Monday. he is busily reviewing films and meeting person-
nel. He expects the work won't be finished until the close of spring

practice.

However. he did hint at the possibility of an eight-man front with

three—deep defensive backs.

“An eigh-man front leaves the possibility of the blitz, of throwing
the quarterback,” he explained. “It gives you the opportunity to go af-

ter somebody.

“When you play three—deep." he continued. “the possibilities of
making a mistake are almost nil. It's hard to get in back of them: where-
as in four-deep. one mistake and it’s six points.”

One defense or the other. at least there are some new wrinkles in
the works. Bill Neal‘s been promoted. but he and Bill Lewis will be
working closely with Sekanovich. And with these fresh approaches.
Pitt football may finally be on the way back. _ '

 

 

champion. Arizona State has a kid
named Melchior; who is a nation-
al small college champ. It’s' go-
ing to be awfully tough.”

Adams felt that Terry Hoover
has a good shotat picking up some
team points at 191. but he didn’t
know how far he could go.

Overall. th e coach felt th at
Oklahome. Oklahoma State. Navy
and Iowa State will be the teams
to beat. Nobody would like to do
it more than Adams.

TOP SWIMMER

season as the top scorer on the

year, registering 124'/2 'points.
Swimming in the various free-

three firsts in one meet, against
West Virginia and Indiana State.
Chris Price was second with

TOM STICKEL can’t quite beat the throw to first in action last year at

_in the afternoon.

In the first game of the double-
header. the Panther mitters took
a 4-2 lead into the ninth inning.
but again collapsed in the field
and allowed Oregon to tie the
score with two unearned runs.

Oregon almost won the game
in the regulation nine-innings.
However. relief pitcher Howard
Mench replaced Rich Orpneck
with no outs. two runs‘ already
across. and the bases loaded. and
stopped Oregon cold.

Mench, who pitched three score-
less innings against Kansas Mon-
d a y ’ s opener, w a s eventually
scored upon in the 11th inning.
He took the loss.

George Medich pitched brilli-
antly in the losing cause. The
tall grider hurled eight frames in
which he allowed only two un-
earned runs.

In the ‘night game. the Pan-
thers brough their record to 2-1
behind three—sport athlete Gus-
tine’s six-hitter.

Back in November, quarterback
Gustine pitched footballs agains
UCLA in a 40-8 defeat. But Tues-
day night Gustine used his pow-
erful right arm in a winning cause
for the baseball tdam.

The Panters scored all their runs
in the third frame. Tom Stickel
singled. and ‘after catcher Sam
Glass reached base on an error.
Gustine loaded the bases with a
bunt single. A wald to second base-
man Cliff Brown and two,addi-
tional Bruin errors accounted for
the four tallies.

In the fifth inning. UCLA scor-
ed all 'of their three runs on two
walks a base hit. and two sacri-
fice flies. But Gustine was near-
ly untouchable the rest of the
way.

Season Opens at Temple

by ED CONLEY .
“There’s not much differencd between indoor and outdoor
track.” claims track coach Jim Banner. He adds. “A few events
"(change and some performances improve a bit: but that‘s all."

This would indicate that Banner and his undermanned squad are

in for a frustrating spring. Ban-
ner has some talent on his team
and he knows it. But. he remarks.
"were still two years away. Depth
is our big problem. now." It was
a definite lack of depth that ham-
pered the thinclads during their
recent indoor season. as they fin-

éished with a 1-2 mark.

Leading the unit into the our-
doors April 6. at Temple. will be
Roger Holly. who was the most
consistent member during the in-
door campaign. He is ready to
run in his specialty. the half mile.
He will also compete in the 440
at times and will be a member
of the mile relay team. Keith
Stoehler and Jack Neyer will hold
down the 440 spots most of the
time.

entry which has been cut to two
members due to an injury to Dave

other healthy sprinter.

Brinn’s loss also cuts into the
depth in the hurdling events. There
are two hurdlers who will com-
pete and both ran well indoors.
They are senior Tom Christie and
sophomore Charlos Reisen.

Pole vaulter Jack Anderson will
return to action in time for the
opener after missing the indoor

The only home meet will be
against Ohio University. one week
