Business Volume,
Employment Up,
Review Indicates

Business in the Pittsburgh district
has increased during the first half of
March, according to the Pittsburgh
Business Review which appears to-
day. The index of business in the
district reached 72.8 in the week end-
ing March 16, a new high for 1935.

The sharp increase in coal produc-
tidn was the chief cause of the rise in
the index in the middle of March. In
the week ending Marcli 16, ‘the index
of coal production was 8.4 per cent
above normal. Production in this ﬁeld
has been greatly stimulated in the
past few weeks because of the fear
of labor troubles after April 1.

During Felnnary national business
suffered a temporary slump, but due
to a reduction by the important indus-
tries in the amount and cost of oper-
ation and production. proﬁts in-
creased slightly during the first half
of March. _ _

After a study of labor conditions,
the Business Review found that em-
ployment in the Pittsburgh district
had dec.rea.sed four times and in-
crased twice from January to Feb-
ruary, the average change being a
decrease of about one-half. of one per
cent. However, the combined pay-
rolls of all ﬁrms increased 0.3 per
cent even though there were fewer
working days in ‘vF‘ebruary than in
January for most industries.

Numbers employed by all ﬁrms in
the district averaged 5.5 per cent
higher in February than in February
of last year. Manufacturing indus-
tries in the district employed 2.7 per
cent more people in February than
in January.

steps in movie technique Tuesday
evening, when S. M. Eisenstein’s
“Potemkin” and Ralph Steiner’s

“H20” were ﬂashed on the screen at
the Falk Elementary school auditori-
um.

“Potemkin” presented for the ﬁrst
time the method of editing or cutting
called “montage.” “Montage” is a
compositional arrangement of mate-
rial already ﬁlmed.

The story is an account of the Amu-
tiny of the sailors on the Russian
steamship, "Prince Potemkin” in
1905.

In “H20” an abstract theme, water
in motion, is taken and built up into
the entire subject. VVater is shown
bubbling, gurgling and boiling.

Ex-Governor Sweet, NRA Interpreter,
Backs Codes Before Inquiry Group

 

“No, we should not scrap the NRA.”
Ex-governor \Villiam E. Sweet em-
phatically upheld the National Indus-
trial T Recovery administration, of
which he is official spokesman, at the
(Viveekly meeting of Inquiry W'ednes-
ay.

Mr. Sweet explained lhat the NRA
has not suffered a lapse as the peo-
ple are prone to think, but that the
President has purposely changed its
policy. This change, he said, is due
to the fact that two years ago the
people would accept anything com-
ing from the White House, but at
present both the people and the press
are discussing every move which the
government makes.

Dr. Marion K. lVI.cKay*, professor of
economics, served as chairman of the

meeting. In the question and an-
swer discussion, Mr. Sweet was
asked:

(Q) Do you think Labor would vote
to continue the NRA?

(A) Absolutely, Labor has never
hadmore protection than it is receiv-
ing under the NRA.

(Q) If the government had not
made great expenditures for relief
could the NRA claim the credit for
relief which it now claims‘?

(A) I am willing to agree that the
expenditure of money by the govern-

ment has had much to do with the
"amount of -relief, but I am not willing
to accept any suggestion that we are
on the dole at presentin as -great a.
degree as we were in 1929.

(Q) Does not the taxation under
the present system fall on the should-
ers of the small wage earner?

(A) No, it does not. However, tax-
ation in this country has not begun
as yet, but when it does it will fall
heavily on the large capitalists, those
who are able to bear it.

Commenting on the position of the
small business man under the NRA
codes, Governor Sweet said: “The
little man undoubtedly has had his
position bettered due to the code. His
main advantage is that his credit is
better than ever.”

In 1'eg2n'(l to the position of the la-
bor group under the recovery act, he
rleclarccl: “The labor group must
have a labor philosophy and until they
 one they will just play marbles
with the labor movement. The group
is sorely in need of men who know
their stuff, and know how to interpret
it for the laborers.” _ ,

The Legislature Investigates

HE INVESTIGATION of the University by ‘five

members of the State legislature, to determine
whether academic and ordinary civil liberties have
liceii abridged iii a State-aided institution, is proof
of a new temper on the part of Americans.
« Fifteen years ago it couldn’t have happened.

Fifteen years 3.g'O«‘Elle--11IllV(3I'Sltl€S were only be-
ginning to make their great appeal to popular im-
:1 gination. \Vc were only beginning to believe that
college education could rush a young graduate
to special delivery success. The belief was erect-
ing splendid endowed gymnasiuins and stadiums
and clock towers all over the country. Families of
scant means were €"VE‘l.‘_VVv'llGI‘8 beginning to sacri-
fice a. little more for that glorious four—year iii-
vcstment.

But there wa.s no qiicstioii.‘ of a'cademic freedom.
We were too shortly out of the war. Legislators
and professors, both, could remember the da.ys of
patriots and slackers, of parades and salutes, of
censored European mail and a cautious expres-
sion of personal COl1\'l(‘.l'l011. There had been only
a. few Charles .A. Beards, and only one Eugene
Debs, to test the old civil liberties. The rest fell
in line. For several years nobody thought of aca-
demic freedom or investigations.

The regime of the ’twcntics was pleasant be-
cause it was prosperous. There was no deep uni-
versity tradition of liberty and political action,
such as there was in Germany and Italy and
France. Graduates found insurance, bonds and
automobiles to sell.

Five years ago the temper had changed, but it
had changed to l7€\Vll(l€1‘lIl€11t. Building programs
had to be checked. Enrollments staggered. Uni-
vcrsity teachers, as a whole, had no more antici-
pated the crash than anybody else, and they had
no greatly better answers. '

Through ﬁfteen years, nevertheless, Americans
have kept their faith in the university. It gave
youth then an innnediafc boost. in the most. imme-
diate of worlds; and now it offers a new race and
.9. new world. VVe are aware, now, of standing

very close to world change, as great a "world
-change as ever took place when Rome or feudalism
-crumbled. Vile are just becoming aware--ironic

ally, almost too lafe—-—of the tremendous crumbling

possibilities of our economic distribution system,
of our great wars, our gases and bombs and bac-
:i.:ci'1a, and of our selﬁsh ﬂaw.

If the legislature ’s investigation has any signifi-
cance, it is this: it shows a. temper to accept the
world as a problem to be solved objectively. “"6
are awarethat academic freedom is meaningful,
both for the teacher and for the student. VVe take
up facts in our hands, in order to make living
intelligent, to make‘ life good.

Away From The Flame
HEN Hervey Allen wrote his war diary, “To-
ward the Flame,” he was writing about events
and fevers of the years 1917 and 1918. Americans

were fascinated by the war  moths are attracted .

to ﬂame. Today the same fascination appears in
the utterances of societicsdcvoted‘ to piles of shiny
cannon and new bombing ﬂeets, but some of the
moths are moving away from the ﬂame.

At universities all over the country, student
bodies will celebrate peace for one hour on the
iuorning of April 12. On the anniversary of
America’s entrance into the world war, Ainerican
stiicleiits will leave classes for an hour to remind
each other that war must not occur again. In the
light of the obvious danger of another war, as
Iliiiropc bends over its weapons, the movement to
celebrate April 12 is pathetically weak. At col-
logos where the liberal tradition is most sturdy,

- nevertheless, student groups will be reenforccd by

their faculties. Between now and April 12 more
colleges will be enrolled in the demonstration. It
caimot be overlooked.

At the University the iiatioiial demonstration of
students should be recognized b_v a special assem-
bly in syiiipathy with this strike against war.
Faculty members who remember the proscriptions
that fell upon American teaching in 1917 and all
liberal student organizations should plan to ar-
range and attend it.

IVORD HAS come from administration officials
of the new Alldrcd Memorial reading room,
“where students will not be permitted serious,
study of any nature and where textbooks on any
subject will be positively barred.” The purpose
of the reading room is for pure enjoyment. Solo-

_ inon shouldn’t have diedesosoon.

Trivia I—Bound To Win

OTHING very serious can be wrong with
America. as long as opportunities remain for
its young men. That. we are still the land of op-
portunity appears in a United Press report:
“John Jacob Astor 3rd, though heir to millions,
began work today at the magnificent salary of $25
a. week for the International Mercantile Marine
(“oinpa.ny, intending to learn the business begin-
ning at the bottom of the ladder.
“He will be expected to arrive at work prompt-
ly and ask no favors.
“Those who know his aggressive personality say
that his climb to an executive position will be
rapid.”

Trivia II—R-E-D M-E-N-A-C-E
UNDER pretext of examining a VVORK OF ART

the other day, two different University audi-
ences SAT AND VVATCHED a. moving picture-
produced by COMl\-IUNISTS.

The audiences watched a. lot of RUSSIAN
sailors, who had been MISLED BY A FEVV AGI-
TATORS into thinking that their meat. was
wormy, MUTINY against the olﬁcers of the S.S.
Prince Potemkin.

Such a picture is AN INSIDIOUS INFLUENCE.

It is BAD ART.

Did the sponsors of the picture come out in the
open with it? NO. One performance was given
BY NIGHT. The other performance was given in
a small room ‘vVITH THE BLINDS DR-A\VN.

NYTHING that has to do with Russ.ia——topsy-

fascinates us college students. At least, three or
four young political moderates who danced at ‘the
Military Ball were curious enough to look for the
flag of the U.S.S.R. among the ﬂags of the nations
banked around the ballroom.

Allegcdly,.they didn’t ﬁnd it because it wasn’t
there.

Asking a semi-ofﬁcial-looking individual why the
flag had been omitted, one inquirer was told:

“\Vhy, uh, we don ’t recognize Soviet Russia.”

Nevertheless, we should be able to recognize the
ﬂag of Soviet Russia. It is a good thing to know
when to shoot and when to shake l1a.nds, particu-
larly if there is going to be a War about anything.
VVhat does it look like, anyhow?

 

Banks Gives Impressions
Of Huey Long, Dcmagogue

By Edwin P. Banks

HE KINGFISH has been in the gold ﬁsh bowl of pub-

lic discussion for so long now that further comments
about him ought to be hushed with the spittle of ma-
chine guns if necessary. Still, everybody is daring to
utter perhaps his famous last word . .

It is foolish to generalize about the attitude of the
good citizens of Dixie toward Huey Long—especially

when you happen to be a sleepy-eyed, corn—footcd col-*

lege debuter out to ring bells and to
make strong men weep under the
inﬂuence of your oratory. The peo-
ple you meet on a forensic tour are
supposed to be the intellectual
cream of the vari.ous campi crops.
Vvhile they may claim to speak for

thcy are voicing only their indi-
vidual sentiments.

Some of the Dixie men we Mei‘-
chants of Breath questioned, coii-
sider Huey a corrupt demagogue of
the lowest order. Others admit that
his political hands need washing but
feel that he has put organization in-

 

evil, but a very necessary one. Still others say that the
Senator has done much for the poor in his state. But
how and why and when, by the sacred bones of General
Lee, is the enormous debt with which he has burdened
Louisiana going to be lifted? Finally, a few declared
simply a.nd fervently that Huey is a great man.

Nobody we met dared to expound the economic theory
underlying Mr. Long's “share. the wealth” program; no-
body, in fact, troubled himself to defend it.
A Tulane Antipathy

At Tulane university, New Orleans. the student body
seems to have a slight prejudice against the Kingﬁsh.
Apparently they don’t relish his policy of cutting down

the state appropriation for Tulane and piling up funds -'

for his godchild, Louisiana State.

The students and faculty members with whom we
came in contact at L.S.U., whether from caution or
apathy did not usually commit themselves to clear cut
opinions on their patron. One thing was certain——they

appreciate his giving them about the loveliest, most’

modern campus in the South.
Why Seven Students Left LSU

'I‘o be sure, the beautiful and costly tiled swimming
pool bears the name “Huey P. Long” and undoubtedly
seven students, including the editor of the campus pa-
per, left school because they didn’t hesitate to spread
disparaging remarks about the Senator. But is the idea
too far-fetched that an organized attack by Pitt students
against the Pennsylvania. legislature during these em-
barrassing times inioht not have similar repercussions
here? Furthermore, a lot of this talk about political con-
trol over L. S. U. is a. great deal like Southern talk about
the University of Pittsburgh.

“Cuss ’Em Down, Boy”

“A master of invective” is Mr. Long, according to al

professor at L.S.U. Perhaps so. In the Hotel Monte-
leone at New Orleans we turned on the radio and lis-
tened to an orator broadcasting from this same build-
ing over VVSDU. This individual attacked several mem-
bers of the Louisiana State judiciary, characterizing
them with such polite epithets as “low down dirty
skunks, low, lying rats” and intimations that hanging
was too good for them. Only debaters, we were under
the impression that the speaker was some representative
from the red light district of New Orleans. Later we
learned that he was none other than the great Mr. Long
himself. Truly, “a master of invective.”
Trade Is Trade

Incidentally, the Pitt campus discussion over the de-
sii‘abilit_v of refusing to meet L.S.U. in a basketball
tournament at Atlantic city, struck this columnist as
pointless and uiifair. Basketball is basketball and poli-
tics is politics. Should we refuse a ping pong match
with Harvard because a Communist or a Monarcliist hap-
pens to be on the latter’s. board of trustees? Is there
something peculiarly anti-social or un-sportsmanlike
about an L.S.U. athlete because Huey Long has devel-
oped a paternal affection for the boys? Share the sports,
Panthers, and let the economic departments decide
whether it‘-wants to share the" wealth; or not.

Maurcr Questions Validity
Of Blind Duty To 0nc’s State

Claims Veneration Of State A False Ideal When Decision
Of War Or Peace Is Before The Public

By Herrymon Maurer

N 1910 a. peace conference was so shocked by Leo To1stoy’s idea, “W'ai' is

not some particularly good affair, but a vile and criminal business," that

it refused to allow his essay to be read. Today, when we are accustomed to

criticism of our economic system, when we hear every day new expressions
of revulsion against war, we are not so easily shocked.

Even today, however, we are disturbed by a discussion of the basic struc-

ture which produces the excretions of war and misery.

 

Such discussions

bite too deeply into our traditional¢

concepts, the concepts which in time
of crises deteriniiie our personal reac-
tions and our intellectual positions.
War may be unfortunate, it may be
cruel, it may be vicious; but when
government, pulpit, and press begin
to speak of duty to home and country",
they appeal to a traditional sentiment
which only too often critics of war
have failed to consider.

This traditional sentiment we call
patriotism; too often we associate it
only with violent speeches on the
necessity and desirability of war as
an institution and with extreme ex-
pressions urging the abandonment of
free speech. The sentiment, however,
goes deeper than its external mani-
festations indicate; it alone gives
meaning to the allegiance of individ-
uals to their state, allegiance under
any circumstances; it alone in 1914
was able to make impassioned cl1a.u-
vanists of jiist-as-impassioned paci-
fists.

The fact is that however proliﬁc
anti-war propaganda may be, almost
all persons have a very real idea of
duty towards their country. Small
wonder it is. For hundreds of years,
the supremacy of the nation over its
citizens has been reeiiforced by the
words and acts of the men it has
made prominent. So accustomed have
we become to the idea of the state, so
often have we listened to exhorta-
tions for us to do our duty toward it
—not only by serving in time of war,
but by voting, by electing proper of-
ﬁcials, by paying taxes, by thinking
about political movements——-that we
have come to look upon it a.s some-
thing integral and active in our lives.

It has been some time since any
one has seriously suggested that the
state—or the nation, if you wish to

call it tha.t—is of divine origin; yet I

we bow before it with not a little of
the reverence ordinarily reserved for
deities. ‘We tend to think of it as
soiiietliing which we meet every day,
as an individual being, as someone
close to us, as someone we ought to
protect.

But is the state an individual? Is
it a being with emotions, with
morals? Is it not ratliei- an imperson-
al thing capable of neither right nor
wrong action, a concept which has
less actuality than a fence or -.1 log
or a building? VVe are not accustom-
ed to ascribing moral virtues to
a fence. 1/Ve realize its utilitarian
functions, and, if it be of practical
use, we allow it to stand; we say
nothing of its capacity for moral
choice. It has none.

So with the state, so with the na-
tion. It exists because it is helpful

to individuals. Perhaps you may say,
“It is helpful to me. It gives me
water and sanitation, police and ﬁre
protectioii. It _-does -something for
me; in return I owe it my support."

But. again, the state is not an indi-
vidual. You don’t give your loyalty
to the fence in your back yard; you
don’t give it your support. Like the
fence, the nation has existence; like
the fence, it is useful as long as it
helps those who live within it. When
it is no longer of use, is it sensible
to treat it with respect because of its
venerability?

VVhat is more, the state has deﬁnite
historical causes; it is not an eternal
absolute which life has dropped upon
us. For many hundreds of years men
lived without any conception of na-
tionality; noi; until the origins of our
modern era did differences in place of
birth or residence convey exclusive-
ness. At that time, when the world
began to lose its stability, lvhen a
middle class anxious for protection of
their trade and their exploiatioii ap-
peared, the world began to break it-
self up into groups; only then did
concepts reminiscent of the ancient
Greeks, Hebrews, and Egyptians ap-
pear.

Left to themselves, men show no
pa.rtic'ular discrimiiiiation toward each
other. If one of them feels pugna-
cious and wants to start a ﬁst ﬁght,
he doesn't inquire if his opponent

Friday. March 29. 1935
tical considerations behind the atti-
tude of mind which cause men who
were born at one spot to make com-
mon cause against those who were
born somewhere else.

And there were, there are, very
practical consideratioiis. In the name
of the nation a group of men may be
assembled to keep the public peace-
or disturb it. In its name rules may
be put forward for the beneﬁt of per-
sons who control it. In its name peo-
ple may be herded and controlled.

Certainly the nation exists for a.
purpose; the purpose of bestowing
beneﬁts on citizens. But beneﬁts on
how many citizens? W'e might ask
how many citizens control it, for
those who control it use it to their
own advantage.

The fact is that a very few men
have the control; and they use it to
their own advantage, telling us that
by some mystical method their inter-
est coincides with the general inter-
est. But is it to the general interest
for a. few persons to pile up millions
of dollars during and after a. war in
which millions of men slaughter each
other? Is it to the general interest
for a few to continue living in luxury
while millions starve, and while mil-
lions more barely subsist? Perhaps
it is not.

Perhaps it is not to the interest of
people generally to establish a fascist
state which keeps ina.ii even more
apart from his fellows, which stiﬁes
his ideas, which starves him still
further so that a few may drink rare
wines and eat delicate meats, which
starves him without giving him a
chance to complain.

But perhaps we may some day
recognize the truth and voice our coii-
victions. Then, those to whose inter-
est it is that we follow their com-
mands, will speak of our duty, our sa-
cred duty, our eternal duty, the duty
to a nation which has done so much
for its citizens.

And it might be wise for us to say
that our duty to our state is no great-
er than our duty to our backyard
fence. E

200 High School Athletes
To Compete Here Tomorrow

 

Meet Scheduled To Open At 11 o’o1oc1: In Field House;
14 Teams Battle For Championship Honors

Approximately 200 track and ﬁeld athletes, representing the
cream of the crop from district high schools, will gather in the Pitt
iield house tomorrow morning for the Second Annual Int.e’rscl1olastic
?invitational relays. Festivities will get under way promptly at 11
o’clock with trial heats in the 50-yard dash. '

Fourteen high schools will compete for the title held by Academy
high of Erie, which is not sending a team to Pittsburgh for this

meet. Leading the pack for Acad
emy’s title will be East Huntingdon,
Ramsey high of Mount Pleasant, sec-
ond-place winners in last year’s event,
and Canonsburg high. Other teams
entered are Vvilkinsburg, Bridgeville,
Sharon, Clairton, Connellsville, Lang-
ley, Vvestinghouse, Georges Township,
Schenley, South Hills, and Peabody.
East I-Iuntingdon leads the list in the
number of men participating, having
entered 22 athletes.

This year’s program has been en-
larged to 11 events with the addition
of the two hurdle events. Last season
there were only nine specialties on
the card.

In the 50-yard dash, 34 sprinters will
engage in survival of the ﬁttest test
for first honors in the dash. Mason,
Panther iresliinan star, won the event
last season in 5.6 seconds.

The record in the high jump will
porbably be untouched due to the fact
that Lewis of Rankin leaped 6 feet
and one-eighth inch to win last year.

Shot putters may havea successful .

afternoon inasmuch as the record held
presently by Patterson of Ramsey has
been surpassed by many of the men
entered in tomorrow’s meet. The
llzinisey tosser heaved the 12—pound
iron ball 42 feet, 21/; inches in the
first invitation carnival.

Ramsey high will have two relay
titles to defend, having won the 8-lap
and medley events last year. Sharon,
Ca.no‘nsburg, Clairton, Connellsville,
Langley, Schenley, and VVestinghouse
will be after Ramsey’s title in the
-S-lap relay. In the medley, Ramsey
will find VVi1kins‘ourg, South Hills,
Langley, Connellsville, C-‘iairtou, East
lluntingdon, and Canonsburg among
their opponents.

The other two relay events, the dis-
tance medley and 12-lap, were won
by Academy in the first invitational
contest. Since the Erie school won’t
be competing, there is bound to be a
new champion in both races.

Ufﬁcials for the meet are: Honorary Referee,
W. D. Harrison; Referee, Captain W. A.
i’alm:e1'; Director of Meet, James Hagan‘
>'tarter, James Potts; Clcrl‘: of Course, Theo-

Tech Theta Xi’s
Beat Kappa Sigs,
Win City Crown

 

Tecl1’s intramural cagers did what
the Tartan varsity has been attempt-
ing to do t'or the past many years-
defeat a Pitt team on the basketball
floor. Theta Xi, intramural champs
on the Schenley campus, performed
the trick Tuesday on the stadium ﬂoor
by taking over the Pitt Greek champs,
Kappa Sigma, 34-33, for the city intra-
mural title.

Theta. Xipstepped out to an early
lead with Bill Spisak, Tartan gridder,
and Bill Green, hurdler, scoring free-
ly on_ spectacular shots. The Kappa
Sigma defense was ragged throughout
the entire first half.

-VVhen Groat arrived for play at half
time, the Kappavsigs trailed 25-9.
Groat’s many interceptions of Theta
Xi passes and quick offensive moves
started a Kappa Sigma rally early in
the third period. By the end of the
quarter, ’l‘ech’s lead was sliced to 11
points.

In the ﬁnal quarter, the Kappa Sigs
really turned on the steam. Groat
paced the Dithridge street ﬁve until
he was ruled from the game by the
personal-foul route. The Kappa Sigs
outscored the Tech team, 13-3 in that
ﬁnal period of play.

Relay Events Are 
Next For Greeks

Feely Announces Indoor Track
Carnival For Fraternities

Interfraternity indoor relays on;
Wednesday. April 3, in the trackf
house will attempt to‘ bring more men i
into Greek athletic competition. Toi
accomplish this, Martin J. Feely, di-
rector of intramural athletics, has de~
vised a plan whereby each event will
be decided on the basis of the average
four men from each house compile in
each event.

In short, the marks of all four con-
testants from each fraternity will be
added, and this total then divided. by
four to determine the team average
for this event. Five points for first
place, three for second, and one for
third will be awarded to the three
highest team averages in each event.
This will. not only encourage more
entries, but will also give the frater-
nity with only average or fair athletic
material an even chance for the team
trophy.

The eight competitive events listed
for the indoor championships are:
200-yard shuttle relay, 8-lap relay,
medley relay (3-2-1-4 laps), high jump,
running broad jump, 12-pound shot,
hop-step-jump, and an eight-man tug
of war.
