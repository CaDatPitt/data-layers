Pitt, city avoid issue of trustee’s e—mails to mayor

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt and city officials reﬁise to com-
ment on a situation involving a Pitt
Board of Trustees member and the
mayor.

A series of e—mails released by
an independent mayoral candidate
last week detail communications be-
tween University Board of Trustees
member and local businessmanjohn
Verbanac and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl. .

In the e—mails, Verbanac makes
suggestions on hiring and ﬁringprac—
tices in the city and writes drafts of
Ravenstahl’s initial announcement of
his mayoral candidacy and a speech
given a year into his administration.

In one e—mail, dated Feb. 25, 2008,
Verbanac suggests thatthe Ravenstahl
administration notﬁre an employee of
the Urban RedevelopmentAuthority,
despite poor job performance, because
of family connections.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
that the University would not com-
ment on the situation.

Joarma Doven, spokeswoman for

the mayor’s office, referred all calls
regarding the e—mails to Ravenstahl’s
campaign office, saying itwas “a cam-
paign issue.”

Ravenstahl’s campaign ofﬁce has
notyet responded with a statement, or
to either conﬁrm or deny the validity
of the e—mails.

Verbanac initially would not com-
ment, and he said he would provide on
Friday a statement he prepared. The
statement has not yet been provided,
and Verbanac has not responded to
ﬁirther calls.

The Pennsylvania Senate ap-
pointed Verbanac a Commonwealth
member ofPitt’s Board of'I‘rustees on
June 30,-2007, accordingto an article
in the Pitt Chronicle.

Verbanac is a Pit alumnus who
graduated fromthe College of General
Studies in 1990, the article said.

Mayoral independent candidate
Kevin Acklin said that “a former
high—ranking city administrator”
approached his campaign with the
e—mails after Acklin mentioned Ver-
banac in the mayoral debate Oct. 16.

'He would not elaborate on who the
‘ “former high—ranking city adminis-

trator” was.

Disability rights still a struggle

Eric Shannon
For The Pitt News

Americans with disabilities stillface employment
and health care problems despite past legislation,
asenator told Pitt students yesterday at the Barco
Senator Tom Harkin, D—Iowa, spoke at Pitt’s

inDisability Law and Policy. V
Harkin wrote and sponsored the Americans

discrimination and provide support for Ameri-

its triumphs, many people with disabilities still.

He recalled challenges leading up to the pas-
sage of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. This
version clariﬁedthe lawto preventinterpretations

more disabled people could ﬁnd work

Harkin said there is a60 percent employment
rate amongpeoplevvith disabilities, oftenbecause
employers lack reasonable accommodations for

“As many employers will tell you, disabled I

people are often their best employees? he said.
“’I‘hey just need an opportunity.” V
He then focused on the current health care
debate, that the ADA currently gves
people the right to receive care at home rather
thanatanursing home. However, Medicaid does
not pay for this, he said. I I
. States recognize the cost effectiveness ofhome
care andﬁmd it, butthey often limitwho receives

these services, Harkin said.

He saidtheacurrenthealthcareproposal gives
states the option ofhome care instead of care at a
nursing home. Inthe plan, states are given incen-
tive to choose home care through a six percent
increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Per-
centages program. Inthis program, the federal

_ government matches a state’s medical spending

so that the statesaves money.

Audience member Georgetta Blackburn, who
was from a local medical supply company, said
there is a loophole in the proposed health care
bill that would not allow .patients to buy the kind
of wheelchair they‘would want. .
“We dorftwanttoletthelawgo backzoyears,”
she said. A
Many Pitt law students attended the event
and said they understood the importance of the
legislation, thoughtheyADA might noteffectthem
directly.
“It’s just the righttliing,” law student Tyler
Dischinger said. _
Uzoma Ogbonna, another law student,
agreed.
“It’s importanttomebecauseIbelieveinequal—

coupling it to another protein, called Hck.

Nef activates Hckinl-lIV—infected cells, and it’s

Smithgall said that because of this, the re-
searchers were able to use Hck as a reporter for
Nef activity in a screening process that looked
for compounds thatmightinﬂuence Nef—induced
activation of Hck.

With the help of the Pitt’s Drug Discovery In-

All - stitute, Smithgall and his colleagues screened a

library of 10,000 chemical compounds against
the coupled Nef—Hck protein.

- They found three compounds that inhibited
the activity of Nef—Hck and interfered with HIV

Pittsburgh not the only ’
city to try taxing students

Leena Ketkar
For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh isn’t the only city debating a proposed _

taxon college students. .

Officials in Providence, R.I., tried to impose
a $150 per studentper semester or $100 per tri-
master fee on students attending the city’s four
private universities. Rhode Island residents whose
parents or guardians pay propertygtaxes would
be exempt. ‘ —

Pittsburgh MayorLukeRavenstahlproposeda
morethan$100perstudentperyeartaxon college
students when he drafted his 2010 budget.

ThetaxinProvidencewasmetwith opposition,
largelyfrom students andbusinesses. Providence’s
four private universities — Brown, Johnson &
Wales, Providence College and the Rhode Island
School of Design —— had previously agreed to
voluntarily pay the city millions of dollars over
a20—year span. ‘

DanEgan,presidentoftheAssociation ofInde—
pendentColleges andUniversities ofRhode Island,
said the universities were shocked about the tax
becausetheythouglittiieiroriginal compensation
agreementwas “generous and-a success.”

Oppositiontothe proposal came not onlyﬁ'om

active studentbody members butfromthe busi-
ness community and allies,.as well.

“Itwasn’tmerely $150 asemester. Itbecomes
$300 ayear, $1,200 ifyougraduateinfouryears,
and with the Perkins loan, itbecomes $1,700 on
top ofyourtuition, ” Egan said. “We just affirmed
and reminded the people of the strengths and
beneﬁts ofhaving our robust health care system
and the potential economic beneﬁts and what
we could do collaboratively. We have a natural
ally base in place.” ‘

I Mayor David Cicilline addressed student rep-
resentatives from each of the four colleges to try
and rally student support for the proposaL The
students overwhelmingly opposed the extra tax.

A I “I think the university in general more than
pays for itself'm both economic and social beneﬁts
to the city. The students, on the other hand, may
not, but taxing them will just defer costs to their
parents or to their ﬁnancial aid or student loans
and make them more antagonistic towards the
city,” Gregory Anderson, a senior at Brown Uni-
versity, said. “The overwhelming consensus is
thatitis abadthing. Itwon’t accomplish anything
other than a temporary cash inﬂow, which the

city will ‘soon make‘ up for by going over budget

inother areas.” _
Providence’s City Council members and Cicil-
line did not respond to requests for comment.
While the proposal inPittsburghhas notbeen
explicitly outlined, Pitt students might have to
pay more than $100 per year to the city. This tax
could be in conjunction with an increased tax on
the health sector. ‘
Several Pitt students said they think the Uni-.
versity puts more_into the communitythan ittakes
out. - -
Notonly do college students stimulate the local
economy, but also parents on college tours come
into the city, as well as patients into the UPMC
system, Pitt sophomore Zack Stavriotis said.
“Taxing students is only going to discourage
alltl1e goodthings thatwe’re doinghereas acom-
munity,” he said.
“As a University, we do so much for our com-
munity already 4 volunteerwork, tutoring for

example — and forcing us to pay more money 4

on top of our rising tuition, especially with the
economy doingso poorly, seems unjust,” Michelle
Boyle, a Pit junior, said.

does, too.

Nothing quite matches that mo-
mentary hysteria though, and by
comparison, any ensuing news can
seem trivial at best Newspapers that
continue G-20 coverage can appearto
be sadistic toward dead horses.

It’_s no stork deliveryto the]olie—Pitt

For news junkies, too much is never

The Pitt Police Blotter chronicles
arrest students every week, and a fol-
low—up story is rare for them, so what
isthedifl'erence?Unlike those students,
though, G-20 arresteesarebeingherd-
ed through the justice system. Many
students said they were innocent but

stillaccepted community service deals, '

fearingunsympathetic judges and self-
contradicting police testimony.
After alleged  rights abuses, a
judicial bureaucracy made these stu-
dents feel more helpless. One result
is a general distrust, maybe even con-
tempt, for institutions meantto protect
students.
A On the ﬂip side, some people who
are actually guilty might be attempt-
ing to slip by based on the conﬁision
generated from so many claims of
wrongful arrest. Overworked police
officers struggle to remember cru-
cial details about their actions. Some
acted properly, but some acted with
reckless impropriety. In recent court
proceedings, some officers could not
even recall the exactcircumstances of
speciﬁc arrests, including exactly how
the students had allegedlyviolated the

Over the past seven months, we
have been treated to story after sto-
ry elaborating on the horrors of the
“dreaded” H1N1 virus.

We have been informed of the
virus’ frightening body count, and
we have been instructed in proper
prevention tips ad nauseum, leaving
the public swirling with aggrandized

— and incorrect — images of sickly.

green pigs spewing the virus out of
grubby, mucus-and-mud-encrusted
snouts one contagious oink after the
next. ’

The initial coverage on H1N1, in
particular, exaggerated the virus’
threat level. ,

Based on thevirus’ early news ex-
posure, one might have thought the
little oinkers had mutated into some
monstrous dinosaur-pig hybrid and
we all had only a few days to live. Of
course, the situation was not nearly
this dire. Not even close. I

This overblown coverage created
two opposite, yet equallyproblematic,
public reactions: those who whole-
heartedly bought into the hype and
those who had an adverse, “boy who
cried swine” reaction.

Recently, this division has mani-
fested itself into‘ a public outcry for
or against the newly released H1N1
vaccine.

On one hand, I haven’t seen
‘many people keen to get their hands
on drugs since watching the movie
“Blow” twice in one weekend.

While the ﬁrst 11 million doses
have been released, there is currently
a massive shortage of vaccines avail-
able.

‘ The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention had originally hoped
to distribute 29 million doses by the
end of October —— a goal that seems
rather unlikely now —- and millions of
Americans continue to wait anxiously

' for their H1N1 vaccine ﬁx.

Inresponse, President Obamahas
declared the H1N1 virus outbreak a
national emergency —- a move that
gives U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Secretary Kathleen
Sebelius the power to move emer-
gency rooms offsite and thus speed
distribution of the vaccines, accord-

" ing to an article by MSNBC.

Particularly, I’ve noticed an agi-
tated urgency among my adult family
members, as well as my friends, to
become vaccinated.

My father, who has taken to driv-
ing around with a face mask “just in
case,” has reminded me repeatedly to
become vaccinated as soon as a shot
becomes available.

 

For every person
infected, another 1.4
will contract H1N1.

.This is not necessarily abad thing,
of course. But then there are the thou-
sands of people who have altered their
daily routines for fear of the virus -
those who stood in line through the
nightto obtain thevaccine, those who
canceled sporting events, school days
and trick- or-treating, those who walk
around with giant containers ofhand
sanitizer and make suspicious, Mc-
Carthian comments to anyone who so
much as sneezes in a nearby room.

These are the people around
which you should avoid using the
term “national emergency.” It’s kind
oflike tellingsomeonewith obsessive-
compulsive disorder that you spat on
his food while he wasn’t looking.

More than 1,000 people have died
from H1N1 — and without a doubt,
we will have a safer, healthier nation
if every American were vaccinated
as soon as possible. But this death
toll is small when considered in the
proper context.

Consider, for example, that ap-

. proximately 36,000 people die of

seasonal ﬂu-related causes each year,
according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, yet it receives
much less hype.

Many pharmaceutical manufac-
turers have delayed or reduced the
number ofseasonalﬂuvaccine doses
because of the pressure to produce
millions of doses of swine ﬂu vaccine,
according to MSNBC.

In short, get the shot when you
can, but until then, it’s not worth

spending your days double-ﬁsting '

Purell bottles.
On the other, more alarming —

and probably gerrn-ridden — hand,

adisturbing amount of people would
refuse the vaccine under any circum-
stances.

According to a Pew Research Cen-
ter poll, 47 percent of Americans said
they would not get the vaccine even
if it were available to them.

Some of these people simplythink
the media reaction to the virus is
overblown and thus don’t see it as
athreat. .

Others, like a friend of mine, say
they don’t believe the virus actually,
exists. Rather, they believe “it’s a
conspiracy of the liberal media to
propagandize the masses in favor of
socialized health care reform.”

But the majority, according to the
Pew poll, think the vaccine is too risky
or that it has not been thoroughly
tested.

This is largely because of misin-
formation spread through word—of-
mouth, as well as online blogs and
chain e-mails.

“We’ve seen e-mails stating that
the vaccine is tainted with antifreeze
or-Agent Orange, causes GulfWarsyn-
drome or has killed U.S. Navy sailors,”
according to FactCheck.com.

One such e-mail read: “Their EVIL
DEPOPULATION plan is in full swing!
Do the right thing... get this story out.
The seasonal ﬂu shot ALSO contains
H1N! and H3N2 and one other deadly
ﬂu. DO NOT TAKE ANY VACCINE.
NONE  NONE  NONE.”

While the government certainly
can’tforce these people to get the vac-
cine, there are risks involved in refus-
ing the vaccine, not only to the non-
vaccine taker, but also to others.

For every person infected, another
1.4 will contract H1N1, according to

. an article in The New Scientist.

Obviously, what we seek here is a
healthy medium. Personally, I think
every American should receive the
vaccine.

By vaccinating as many people as
possible, we can contain the spread of
thevirus and therefore curb fatalities,
limit money spent on medical bills
and spare your fellow world citizens
the delightful experience of quivering
in bed for three days straight.

However, remember that'H1N1
is not the bubonic plague. Be patient
while waiting for the vaccine. Chances
are, you’ll survive.

Blago book a gossip grab bag

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

   

I’ve just ﬁnished the latest in tragi-
comedy—tragic,becausethebookin
question isan autobiography of a man
fallen from grace, and comedy, because
that man is Rod Blagojevich.

“The Govemor”isaf“‘d<inggolden
opportunity to discover what the ex-
govemor of my home state, Illinois, has
to say for himself.

Before I picked up this book, I ex-
pectedto laughmywaythroughit. The
back cover photograph, intended to
portray Blagojevich as a tough ﬁghter,
instead makes him look like a consti-
patedMuppet. .

Page 36 contains a gem. He re-
counts the wake of his great-uncle,
during which his father hit him when
Blagojevich defended his brother for
taking a shot of whiskey.

Blagojevich, a newly minted 6-year-
old, said itwas “the ﬁrst time I can
remember being falsely accused of

peated incantations of his innocence,
but Blagojevich never mentions what,
exactly, he is innocent of — otherthan

. every single nasty thing anybody has

ever said about him.

Tony Rezko hardly rates a men-
tion, only that he was a slippery guy
who fooled —— fooled, Isay»——— poor,
honest and gullible Rod.

Forallhisattemptstopainthimself
asavictimbetrayedbytiiosehethought
werehisfriends, Blagojevichisnotcon-
vincingwhen he says he knew nothing

of the corruption to which his chief of _

staff pled guilty. , '

Though Blagojevichtalks aboutthe
wiretapped conversations, he never
discusses the most “f"‘cl<ing golden”
of them: ﬁlling Barack Obama’s Sen-
ateseat. -,

he lives. V
Blagojevich also does not discuss
why he watched a Blackhawks game

i in Chicago while the Illinois General

Assembly was about to vote on a pro-
posal— one thatthe govemorwanted
tohavepassed—duringanemergency

- session that-the governor had called.

He makes some indictments, too.
He accuses Illinois Speaker of the
House Michael Madigan andhisdaugh—
ter, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, of
conﬂict of interest, attemptingto shake
Blagojevich down for campaign ﬁinds
and generally not being nice people.
He calls Jesse Jackson a media
hog.  .
He implies that his father-in-lav;
Alderman Richard Mell of Chicago, is
amanipulative scoundrel. I I

Finally, and most hilariously, .

Blagojevich says most members of the

For nearly 50 years, Mellon Arena
has been a Pittsburgh staple. In
addition to thousands of sporting

- events, the venue, has hosted the

most talented artists that ever lived
— while serving as the link between
its generations. ,

For half a decade, this was the

best place — the only place? —-. in
the city where an adult could take
his son or grandson to share an ex-
perience where they’re both enter-
tained, and through that entertain-
ment, brought closer together.
_ As technology and culture make
it increasingly difﬁcult for people of
different generations to relate, Mel-
lon Arena has become the essence
of Pittsburgh’s desperate ﬁght to
protect that bond.

While a newer, better arena
emerges just across the street, Pitts-
burgh has begun to say goodbye to
its old friend. ‘ i

In the shadow of its state-of-
the-art replacement, Mellon Arena
will welcome patrons for its ﬁnal
concert, its ﬁnal circus and its ﬁ-
nal comedy show over_ the next 12
months. ‘

Consequently, Pittsburghers
packed Mellon Arena Sunday for

fans than just a chance to see a good show.

what might be another 1ast-time-
ever spectacle: the arena’s ﬁnal pro-

fessional wrestling show.

Did you just make a wisecrack
about pro wrestling? I’m sure it was

original and well founded.
Professional wrestling contrib-
utes to the arena’s mission just as
much as any Penguins game held
in the same building. Through

its unique style of storytelling,
wrestling intentionally tailors its
plotlines to suit all age groups.
Blended in with the aged mys-
tique of Mellon Arena, there was

a special ambiance present in the
arena Sunday night, a vibe that
went unnoticed by most — but only
because they were the ones creating
it.

powerful processor.

Luckily, those wrong turns have
generated some of the most brilliant
advancements ever made in proces-
sor design. ,

The ﬁrst processors, which were
generatedusingawhole bunch of indi-
vidual chips, werefoundtocapquickly,
leading to the brilliant idea of putting
millions of transistors on a single chip
die.

Intel’s attempt to clock the hell out
ofits Pentium4processors, generating

one in excess of4.0 GHz, resulted in a
chip that would easily melt most com-
putercases andbankruptmost munici-
palities in power consumption.

This setback, however, led some-
one to speculate that a chip with mul-
tiple, somewhat independent proces-
sor cores could provide just as much
horsepowerwithoutshutiingdownthe

Its journey took a ridiculous mm
with a simple thought: If having two
cores is good, then having hundreds
of cores is better. ‘

Although this is not much when

Swank soars as Earhart

‘Director Mira Nair explores the life of the famed aviatrix

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Writer

“Amelia”

Starring: Hilary Swank, Richard Gere,
Ewan McGregor - V

Directed by Mira Nair

Studio: Fox Searchlight Pictures

Grade: B-

While “Amelia” did not soar like its avia-
trix namesake, it did manage to get off the
ground as an interesting biopic of an out-
standing woman.

The movie’ uses Amelia Earhart’s fatal mis-
sion, punctuated by vignettes of herjourney,
to chronicle the life of the legendary aviatrix
from a dreamer living in Kansas to the United
States’s favorite airborne sweetheart.

Few people’s faces contort‘ in confusion
at Earhart’s name, but one can say with‘ fair
certainty that most are unaware of the begin-
nings of Earhart’s celebrity, her personal life
and her actual skill level. '

“Amelia” successfully shows that the fa-
mous ﬂyer was‘ an imperfect, if not utterly
charming, individual.

The movie portrays Earhart’s character
as a sassy, ambitious girl from Kansas who
‘simply wants to ﬂy.

She strolls into the olﬁce of New York
publisher George P. Putnam, hoping to reach
that goal. Though she is a passenger on her
ﬁrst flight, she pursues her desires.

The theme of perseverance recurs in the
movie. . _

Despite a lack of funds and a publicly poor
takeoff attempt, Earhart continues to try.

As her star begins to rise, so do Putnam’s
affections for Earhart. In a scene where Ear-
hart lays out the marriage like a business
deal, it’s made clear that she doesn’t want
to settle.

“Amelia” brushes the surface of an inter-
esting conundrum with the idea that Putnam
loves Amelia for reasons that could mean
losing her. He adores her for her free spirit,

.(‘i.

T _ Courtesy Ken Woroner
Amelia Earhart wouldn’t think of taking off without powdering her nose.

but she makes him promise that if she isn’t
happy after a year of marriage, he will let
her leave.

Inevitably, Amelia’s sense of adventure
and spunk that attracts Putnam to her is also
what makes him fear he’ll lose her. _

Earhart was not a brilliant pilot. A

Granted, she did have technical skills and
adequate knowledge. But she was more a
flying enthusiast than prodigy.

She had her share of aviation mishaps
which made her ﬂights even riskier.

One of the most interesting relationships -

in the movie is that of Amelia and her friend
Gene Vidal, played by Ewan McGregor.

The ﬁlm explores the rumor that the two
were involved in a romantic entanglement.

This demonstrates an important facet of
Earhatt’s personality — the part that wanted
to be free.

Unfortunately, it seems evident that Hol— O
/lywood added a coat of gloss over the truth '

when Earhart says she wishes to cutties and
remain faithful to her husband.

Hilary Swank phenomenally captures the
quirky magnetism of Earhart, particularly
vocally.

Despite occasionally cheesy dialogue and
shallow plot, Swank manages to recreate a
striking character. .

But her co—star Richard Gere gives a lack-
luster performance as Putnam,‘which could
result from playing a man who seems content

’ to stand out of the spotlight.

At times, Swank and Gere have awkward
chemistry, particularly at the beginning of
the ﬁlm. , _

As the movie continues, however, they
muster up the ability to appear more natural
in a romantic relationship.

“Amelia” is not overly dramatic, as many
biopics of legendary individuals are, but it
does seem to have that Hollywood sugar-
coated truth to make it neater and more di-
gestible for an audience that wants to come
out with its idea of a feminist hero mostly
intact.

Professionalwrestling unites all ages

Wrestling 4 9

More than 13,000 people descended upon
Mellon Arena for the World Wrestling Enter-
tainment pay—per-view event, Bragging Rights
— not an unusual statistic for many of the
arena’s events. But the attendees didn’t match
the proﬁle of those for a normal performance.

There was aunique mix of very young children '

— accompanied by parents, of course — and

a separate mass of adults who came purely for

their own enjoyment.
According to a 2009 market survey, one-

third of WWE viewers are either younger than
18 or older than 49. The other two-thirds of
viewers aren’t much closer in age, spanning
somewhere in within that 31-year range.

It’s one thing to just look atthe numbers,
but when you’re at a live event and you a see
a 6-year-old cheering for the same reason
as a 60-year-old, you know that something
special is happening that just doesn’t happen
enough anymore.

Perhaps no event better epitomizes the

reason why Pittsburgh loves Mellon Arena
than professional wrestling. There’s the
World-class entertainment, but more impor-
tantly, there’s an opportunity for two very dif-
ferent generations to share something.

.One man stood in the will call line Sun-
day, waiting to pick up his wrestling tickets.
Because of the event, because of the nature
of this arena, he had a connecﬁon with those
around him.

“You know, the dome of this building used

to open and close,” he said to someone at least
30 years younger than he.

It’s possible that the man in line and the
child he was talking with had nothing else
in common, and at any other event, they

wouldn’t even notice each other. But right >-

then, right there, as they stood in line for the
very same reason, they bonded.
Neither of them noticed their generation

83P-
Either that, or it just didn’t matter here.

  Crunching

core issues
Technology < 9 V

Despite an increase in manpower; the office

' mightremainjustas eflicientor, incircumstances

ofbad management, lose eﬂiciency. .

Thisis notto saythatmany core systems are
not athoroughly bad idea.

Graphics processorsutilizedtens orhundreds
of cores before. Theyarebeginningto maketheir
way into generalpurpose computing, buttheyare
experiencing snags.

Large numbers of cores are excellent at
crunching numbers.

They are not necessarily as eﬂicient at per-
forming the constant I/O operations that char-
acterize everyday computing.

The Tilera processor might ﬁnd 100 cores
inefﬁcient at performing ﬁle reads or efficient
memory allocation, among othertasks. .

'I‘ilera published accounts of its new Tile-GX
processors, claiming that its conﬁguration of
grids of processors is superior to the multi-core
technologr currentlybeingchampionedby Intel
and AMD.

The grid pattern, Tilera claims, makes its
processors more easily scalable and allows for
more eﬂicient communication between proces-
sor cores. , ' 0 _ A

Iftrue, the Tilera processors might indeed
overcome some of the eﬂiciency problems that
characterize multi-core_ systems. '

Tilera also championed backward compat- —

ibility and allowed its pmcessorsto communicate
with Intelx86 processors connectedinparallel on
a computer’s motherboard.

This communication could enable the Tilera
processorto handlethe problems itcan solve most
readily, while leaving more diﬂicult problems to
an Intel processor with fewer cores and fewer
complications. ' .

Ultimately, as processing demand outstrips
the capabilities for eventhe most powerful of cur-
rent multi-core processors, some breakthrough
mustbemade inmakingthe division of computer
problems andthe channels through which cores
communicate more efﬁcient. _ V

Tilera might very well have made this break-
through. A T

Volleyball (1

Stadelman was recruited as a

I r walk—on and was redshirted her

freshman year before earning a
scholarship this season.
Stadelman said Beerman no-

ticed her after one of the last»

camps he worked at Carrick High
SchooL

“He said, ‘Alright, you work
hard. Come on,”’ Stadelman said.
“I think it was my work ethic that
got me on the team, because I
wasn’t trained very well. I was
pretty raw, but I showed '1 had

‘a -heart and he took me.”

Hodnik took a different route
to Pitt’s starting lineup.

After a AAA All-State selection
at North Allegheny High School
in 2006, she gave up volleyball
competitively during her ﬁrst se-
mester at Pitt. She turned down
the recruiting pursuits of other
schools.

“It was really tough,” Hodnik

said. “Luckily, it worked out re- .

ally well. I deﬁnitely missed the

"‘ high competition. I played club

[volleyball] and it was a lot of fun
and everything, but I was looking
for the games every weekend —

high-level, more serious compe-
tition.” _

That’s where the volleyball
team came in — and Stadelman
remembered Hodnik making the
team.

“We needed a setter,” she said
about Hodnik.

A Jen Zettl I STAFF POGRAPHE
Senior Melissa Stadelman carries her Terrible Towel in her backpack.

The two are all about Pitts-
burgh — all the time. They grew
up here, they’re attending school
here and they don’t plan on living
anywhere else. ' '

Stadelman said her house is
even visible from the Fitzgerald
Field House, where Pitt hosts its

volleyball matches.

But Oakland‘ is still just far
enough away from the South Side
slopes for her. ’

“I even feel away from home
because when I was younger, I
never went to Oakland. It’s not
my backyard. Even being here,
it doesn’t feel like home, but it’s
close enough where I can still go
home,” Stadelman said.

Hodnik said  of her'par—

ents come to every game —— home I

and away — in which she plays.
That’s dedication, considering

Pitt has played road games at Lou— '

isville, Ky., Albuquerque, N.M.,
Washington, DC. and Tampa,_ Fla.,
this year. _ _

“They like to bring me care
packages,” Hodnik said. “Maybe
some home-cooked food.”

Hodnik, who is a junior aca-

B demically, is considering what

to do after graduation. Shewill
either go to graduate school and
use her fourth year of playing eli-
gibility or give up that year and
get ajob.

“Either way, it shouldn’t be
tough to stay here,” she said.

'Pittvo|lalI playrs ‘dig’ thesteelers

Stadelman, on the other hand,
wants to become a missionary
after graduation, which means
she’ll spend two years away from
Pittsburgh.

“The Lord might take me away
from Pittsburgh for a few years,”
she said. “But hopefully I’ll bring
my Terrible Towel and my jersey
and represent. We have to spread
the loye of the Steelers.”

As for the Terrible Towel, Sta-

_ delman said both _she and Hodnik

carry one in their backpacks at
all times. . .

“We get upset because we have
to travel and we miss the games,”
Hodnik said.

“We lose_a lot of sleep over
missing these games,” Stadel-
man said.

As if they weren’t serious

' enough, Pitt volleyball coach Toby

Rens said the ﬁrst question the

.two asked his assistant coaching

candidates over the summer was,
“‘Are you a Steelers fan?”’ Rens
said with a laugh.

It must have worked.

“Well, the ones who said they
weren’t didn’t get the job,” he
said.

Defensive DeCicco

Pitt ranked No. 15 after win over South Florida

jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

Junior su'ong safety Dom DeCicco

was named Big East defensive player

r of the week after his performance

in No. 15 Pitt’s 41-14 win over South
Florida on Saturday.

DeCicco ﬁnished the game with

a team-leading 10 tacldes and made

several stops as part of the Panthers’

. ‘rundefense.

It was his second 10 —tackle game
of the season, as he made seven solo
and three assist tacldes against Rut-
gers on Oct. 16.

Before Saturday, the Bulls aver-
aged 407.3 yards and 33.7 points

' ‘ per game. The Panthers’ defense
held South Florida to 212 yards and
14 points, which included a late-
game touchdown when the “score

was 41-7.

With the win, the Panthers im-
proved to 7-1 overall — their best
start since 1982 -— and 4-0 in the
Big East.

DeCicco’s defensive success comes
as no surprise. He leads the team with
62 tacldes and two interceptions, and
his 7.8 tackles per game ranks seventh
inthe Big East. ,

Eight weeks into the season, the
Panthers rank in the top 30 in four
categories: ﬁrst in sacksv(33), 21st in
rushingdefense (102.13 yards/game),
24th in scoring defense (18.0 points/
game) and 26th in total defense
(314.13 yards/game).

The Panthers have a bye this

weekend and will resume the ﬁnal

quarter of their schedule when they

host Syracuse at Heinz Field on  .
7. Kickoff for the conference game is

set for noon.

Panthers take center court in Blue-Gold matchup tonight

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

When the Pitt men’s basketball team hosts
its annual Blue-Gold Scrimmage tonight,
it will be fans’ ﬁrst chance to see the 2009-
10 team.

Tip-off for the game is set for 7 p.m.

Head coach Jamie Dixon uses the Blue-
Gold scrimmage as a real game simulation
and follows a typical game day schedule.
The game will consist of two seven-player
split squads, which will play two 15-minute
halves with a ﬁve-minute
halftime break. M

The Panthers return one
starter in senior guard]er-
maine Dixon, who is one of '
two seniors on the team. Se— 
nior transfer Chase Adams 3 _
comes to Pitt after spend- /
ing three years at Centenary
College in Louisiana.

Returning players in-
clude junior letter-winners
Brad Wanamaker and Gary
McGhee, along with sopho-
more letter-winners Ashton
Gibbs and Nasir Robinson.
Gibbs won a gold medal

 

with Team USA at the FIBA U19 World Cham-
pionships over the summer.

Freshmen Dwight Miller and Travon
Woodall —— who were redshirted last sea-
son -— make their return, as well..

Four freshmen also join the Panthers.
Lamar Patterson, ].J. Richardson, Dante
Taylor and Talib Zanna are new faces on
the team.

Pitt ﬁnished the 2008-09 season with a

" 31-5 overall record and advanced to the Elite

Eightfor the ﬁrst time since 1974. It also
peaked as the nation’s No. 1—ranked team

during the season and earned an overall ,

No. _1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament. Both were
ﬁrsts for the program.
Admission to the
Blue-Gold game is free
and open to the public.
General admission seat-
ing is available, and fans
are encouraged to move

Huerbin Legends

Mick Williams guarantees it.

After Pitt’s 41-14 victory over South
Florida Saturday, the senior defensive
tackle said this year’s team will not stop
winning any time soon. - '

"‘We’re happy with 7-1,” Williams,,who
ﬁnished the game with three tackles, said.
“But when we’re 11-1, that’ll be good for
us.”.  5 f
To get there, the No. 15 Panthers (7-1,
4-0 Big East) will need to string together

four consecutive victories to end the sea- :5

son. ' . -
That’s hard to do for any Division I
school, but it might be even tougher for
a Pitt team that has struggled under the
national spotlight;  _ C .
Last year, the Panthers lost theirﬁrst
home game of the season to Bowling Green
and didn’t creep back into the top 25 until
they upset South Florida in Tampa, earning
a No. 17 ranking.
_ The following week, they lost to a 2-5

Pitt prowls into rankings

Rutgers team.

It-was a season of ups and downs for a
team that eventually lost a thrilling game
to Oregon State in the Sun Bowl.

But after watching the Panthers this
season, it’s safe to say Williams’ claim isn’t
too far fetched. I almost want to guarantee
it, too. This year is much different.

The No. 20 ranking didn’t hurt the Pan-
thers, who destroyed the Bulls. The team
gets three of its last regular-season games
at Heinz Field, including a season ﬁnale
matchup against Cincinnati that could
determine the Big East champion.

But the Panthers, who have next week— »

fend off, must find a way not to overlook a
Syracﬁse team: that could —- but shouldn’t
— gi;s,4Egg;li_them problems.

The"Orange visit Pittsburgh on Nov. 7

-and are currently ranked ﬁrst in the con-
-ference in rushingdefense.

This game will be a clash of the best
in Big«East as Pitt’s second-ranked rush-
ing offense (179.5 yards per game) faces
a Syracuse defense that allows an average
of 83.4 rushing yards per game. -

Not a problem. If the running game

Dangerous defense, solidoffense leads team

Pitt football forgets last season’s losses to rebound with rec_ord—setting play and No. 15 ranking

Huerbin< 13

slows down, the Panthers have the third
most efficient quarterback in the coun-
try.
Redshirt senior Bill Stull has had a ca-
reer year and stands on pace to throw for
roughly 2,500 yards and 24 touchdowns,
which is a big difference from his 10 touch~
downs and nine interceptions in 2008.
That might be one reason for the play
caller’s renewed conﬁdence — and lack

of boos from Pitt fans — heading into the
ﬁnal quarter of the season.

“Defenses can’t stop two masses,” Stull
said. “If you try to stop our running game,
we’re going to make some plays through
the air and vice versa.”

As simple as Stull’s postgame quote is,
it’s absolutely true. ~ - ‘

Head coach Dave Wannstedt put to-
gether a well-balanced offensive attack —

’ even getting away from his conventional

run-first mentality —‘ which has helped
Stull emerge as a great quarterback.
This year’s offense is one of the best
in recent years, and the departure of
LeSean McCoy has given true freshman
Dion Lewis a chance to make history.
Through eight games this season,
Lewis has rushed for 12 touchdowns and
will no doubt break McCoy’s freshman

record of 15 before the season ends. _

That I will guarantee.

But unlike McCoy, who spent one year
at a prep school before coming to Pitt,
Lewis — and true freshman Ray Graham
+ will be at Pitt for at least another two

’ seasons. ‘
This makes for one of the most danger-

ousdefenses in the nation.

Senior tight end Dorin Dickerson said
last year’s offense revolved around,McCoy.
When McCoy ran into problems, so did
the rest of the team. 0

But this season is different because of
the number of playmakers on the team.

g“This year we have Oderick Turner,
Jonathan Baldwin, Mike Shanahan,‘Dion
Lewis and Ray Graham —— a lot of guys
that can make plays,” Dickerson said. “We

also have a great offensive line  a veteran V '

line. It’s just a good feeling right now.”

I Don’t discount Dickerson as somebody
who “can make plays,” either. He has been
one of Stull’s favorite targets this year,
coming down with 32 receptions and nine
touchdowns. ~-

To put things into perspective, Dick-
erson had 13 catches for two touchdown
in 2008. ‘

Talk about a turnaround for a guy who
started his time at Pitt as a wide receiver
before moving to linebacker in his sopho-
more season, then to tight end last year.

Dickerson and the rest of the Panther
offense have made a ‘great turnaround
this season, and since the monumental
collapse against North Carolina State, the
defense has improvedover the season. It_
leads the country in sacks with 33. That’s
_four more than the always-defensive USC
Trojans. . - I

No matter how well the offense plays,
Williams said he doesn’t want fans to for-
get about the defense. The Panthers want
to make it as hard as possible for other
teams to play them. _

“I was really irritated, personally,”
Williams said about giving up two touch-
downs to the Bulls Saturday. “I wanted to
come out with a goose egg.”

Maybe next time.
