At that time, MacLeod
opposed immediate imple-

Testifying before the Senate

“There’s a complicated hist-

That brought a hostile.
reaction from the Democratic
members of the committee who
wanted deﬁnite, answers on
MacLeod’s intentions.

Allocations Committee Makes Changes for Hrings

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Stallwriter

The Student Government Board
Allocations Committee began its
1980 ﬁscal year hearings this week,
operating under several proceed-
ings changes.

Most obvious of the changes is
the switch of the start of hearings
from the first week in April to the
first week in March.

Committee chairman Mike Seitz
said yesterday that hearings were
moved up one month in order to
allow the committee to ﬁnish its
budget reviews and recommenda-
tions before the end of winter term.

In past years, budget hearings

have dragged on through spring,

and summer sessions, causing
student organizations to be uncer-

tain as to their ﬁnancial status for
the coming ﬁscal year.

Additionally, many members of
student organizations were not at
Pitt during spring/summer hear-
ings and could not argue in favor of
their ﬁnancial requests.

Another change Seitz said has
been made is the submission of
SGB and standing committee
budgets as a block-, rather than
having each committee turn in its
budget separately.

“This way it's not as easy for
SGB to dwell on‘ picky things,”
Seitz said in regard to the required
ﬁnal board approval of committee
recommendations. “They have to
look more at the economic aspects
of the whole picture.”

The package of board and

standing committee budgets was
reviewed by allocations Monday
night. Requested was $58,814.08
for the board and ﬁve standing
committees, with allocations ap-
proving approximately $57,000.
Seitz noted the request for ﬁscal
year 1980 was down nearly $40,000

from last year’s request. In ﬁscal '

year 1979 the board and its
committees requested approxima-
tely $97,000, with nearly $69,000 of
that amount approved.

However, Seitz added that
Homecoming Committee has not
yet submitted a- budget. Its
expenditures this year totalled
almost $10,000, and if a request for
a similar amount is made and
approved for 1980, SGB and its

Galanski Pushes for WPGH PM Open Air Station

Pitt News Staff Writer

Student Government Board Pres-
ident Stan “Galanski ‘stressed the

need for an open-air FM radio‘

station at Pitt in an interview
yesterday.

“It is ridiculous for a university
of this size to not have a radio
station that can be heard in the
community,” he said.

According to Galanski,
verting WPGH to an open-airFM
station would cost little, and the
advantage would be immense.

i “As well as rock music, the
station could broadcast symphonies
and lectures. It would be an
educational station,” he said. ‘‘If
we had John Ehrlichman here for a
lecture, that could be broadcast as
well any debates or seminars that
may take place.” .

Galanski said that students
should have a place to turn to as
“the voice of Pitt”,no matter where
they live, for class cancellations

CO1‘l- .

.and news as well as for

entertainment.

“A radio station could do a lot
publicity-wise for the university
and also provide a more job-
oriented program in the communi-
cations ﬁeld,” Galanski said. “The
people at WPGH are well trained

and many of them go on to jobs .'

with radio and television stations
after graduation.” 9

Another issue facing the new
board is student union renovations
and who will be paying for them.

“No one is in favor of students
paying for the renovations, but it
will happen one way or the other,”
said Galanski, “whether it is
through an increase in tuition or
through a student union fee.”

According to Galanski, the
facilities he would like to see added
to the present student union
include:
location for the food co-op, a
newstand and better food service in
the recreation room and Uncle

an auditorium, a central

“If we had an auditorium, in
the Student Union, we wouldn't
have to try and find a room in the
Cathedral or David Lawrence,” he
said.
Ehrlichman or Sea Level and have a

place for the lecture or concert.”
Galanski added students must

have control over the building and
how the money is spent. He said
that this could be done by
establishing a Student Union
Board. . 0

“Among theother issues facing
the board are a new campus bus
route, the 'Undergraduate Aca-
demic Review and the re-organized

Galanski said he hoped that the
new campus bus route will go into
effect July 1 andthe Undergrad-
uate Academic Review should be

No Alternative Curriculum Program for Fall 

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Although university administrators have yet to issue an ofﬁcial
statement about the fate of the Alternative Curriculum program, it has
been omited from the fall term 1979 course description and time
schedule booklets.

I’

Gale McGloin, program coordinator, said yesterday that Irwin J.
Schulman, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, was contacted by
a coordinator in January to discuss inclusion of the curriculum in the

two booklets. S

Program coordinators, McGloin said, “got wind” at that time that
the curriculum was under administrative scrutiny and could possibly be
discontinued. In light of the unstable status of the program, Schulman
was asked to include Alternative Curriculum in fall registration
materials.

It would be easier, McGloin said, to publicize the program as
a registration option and later remove that option if Alternative
Curriculum were cancelled, than to continue the program yet not
publicize it in registration booklets.

Such a situation, McGloin said, would probably cut down on already
low enrollment since students would not be aware at registration of the
program’s existence.

McGloin said at the time Schulman was contacted “the impression
was that it (Alternative Curriculum) would be listed. I think it’s very

Irwin J. Schulman, (right) deam of the College of Arts and Sciences and Gail McGloin, left, an advisor with the Alternative
Curriculum program exchange differing views of why that program was not included in the fall term time schedule or
course description. - COOK Dh0l0

peculiar that this would be eliminated from the time schedule before a
final decision (is made on whether to continue the program),” she

added.

McGloin also submitted a letter to The Pitt News and to Schulman
about the omission. Contacted yesterday, Schulman said he preferred
not to comment in an interview but would reply to McGloin’s letter with
one of his own (see box, right).

The Alternative Curriculum program was first reviewed by CAS
Council in a public meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 1979. There
Schulman noted the cost of the program was $10,000 for an enrollment
of 20 students and asked McGloin and co-coordinator Hansen
Kappelman to advise him as to the pros and cons of continuing of
terminating the curriculum.

Alternative Curriculum was tabled twice in subsequent meetings,
with Schulman stating on Feb. 9 that the possibility of eliminating the
program existed because of the ‘financial crunch" the university faced
in drawing up its 1979-80 budget.

A vote taken by the council on Feb. 23 favored the continuation of
Alternative Curriculum, 5-4-1. However, after the meeting, the
abstaining voting was changed to nay, tying the tally. Schulman then
cast the deciding vote that registered the council as recommending the
program be discontinued.

But Schulman rescinded the latter vote, saying he made a “tactical

error” in compiling it in lieu of a council meeting.
CAS council may vote again today on the Alternative Curriculum
issue if a motion to revote is made by a council member.

Dear Editor:

My inquiry into Alternative
Curriculum began last January. At that
time I knew the university, and the
College of Arts and Science.s in par-
ticular, were faced with a severe finan-
cial crisis. Budgets had been cut in
December, and even deeper cuts were
contemplatedfor 1979-1980. My office
was not spared. AC was costing the
College a considerable amount of
money; yet enrollments had been drop-
ping. Thus I asked CAS Council to
assist me in deciding what to do about
AC.

I deleted the listing for AC from the
time schedule and the course description
booklet because I thought it would be
easy to recruit students for A C by other
means if CAS Council and I decided to
keep AC. All the students in AC are
freshmen or sophomores, who register
through our advising center. It would
be a simple matter to inform advisers in
good time if AC were in fact retained.
But since I thought there was a good
chance that AC could not be retained, I

exhaustive, thoughtful, and responsible.
AC representatives were invited to at-
tend, to give testimony, and to observe.
Councilfound much to criticize, and in
the end the choice‘ was between a refor-

discussion was as objective as I could
make it. Privately, I became in-
creasingly skeptical about the prospects
for reforming AC, raising its enroll-
ments, and attracting more faculty in-
volvement. Effective reform required
more money, and we didn ’t have it. Yet
my position was that if CAS Council
gave a strong endorsement to AC, I
would take that as a mandate. But CAS

on a recommendation to continue a

not bear the responsibility for deciding
how our limited funds are to be
allocated; that responsibility, at least in

Commuters

By PETER KARLOVICH

The Commuter Affairs Commit-
tee met yesterday with representa-
tives of the Port Authority Transit
and the Student Union Ticket
Office to discuss why PAT’s U
tickets are not available on a
regular basis to commuters.

The U passes, good for a 50-cent
ride on PAT buses, are sold to all
university students for nine dollars.

Robert Harvey, PAT representa-
tive, said Pitt owes money for 4,500

. books of tickets sent to the ticket

office on consignment. He said all
Pittsburgh schools purchase the
tickets but Pitt is the ‘largest buyer
and also holds the largest debt to
the port authority.

“I can’t understand why the port
authority didn’t contact the ticket
office when the debt got too large,”
SGB member Helen Gianella said.

“We didn’t stop sending the
tickets out of animosity or as
punishment. When the auditors

is a new method for evaluating
financial requests.

A criteria sheet that weighs each
request on the basis of concept,
value and feasibility is being
employed by allocations to deter-
mine the legitimacy of requests,
‘Seitz said. 1

After talking with organization
'.members, each request is scored
“with the ﬁnal tally used in
determining how much money
should be allocated, he stated.

Seitz said the Allocations Com-
mittee has been consolidated under

uthe Galanski administration with

SGB’s Committee on Student
Organizations.

Although not in practice yet.
Seitz stated allocations will be
taking on the defunct committee's
function of reviewing established
and proposed student organiza-
tions.

The Allocations Committee will
next be reviewing proposed bud-
gets of SGB’s seven governance
groups, and will then look over
budgets for student special interest
groups.

Question PAT U-Pass-

saw such a large debt, we had to
stop sending the tickets,” Harvey
replied. ~

Chris Chergy, director,of the
Student Union Ticket Office said,
according to her records, Pitt only
owes PAT for the last 1,000 tickets
received. 1

“We sent the money to the
accounting office and they were
supposed to take care of it. When I
called to order more tickets,
nobody said anything about the

‘ debt,” she said.

Chergy said the lag in payment is
probably caused by the fact that it
takes 7 to 8 days for the accounting
office to send the money.

In February, the ticket office was
out of U tickets for two weeks,
which brought complaints from a
number of commuters. The situa-
tion prompted Bernadette Howard,
recently elected co-chairperson of
the Commuter Affairs Committee,
to approach PAT about the

-problem. '

said at the meeting.

All present at the meeting
agreed that better communication
needs to be established between

why tickets were withheld in
February. Harvey replied that at
the time Pitt owed a great deal on
tickets.

owed $59,500,",he said.

Anita Bryant Carries on Crusade

New York-—Singer Anita Bryant carried her crusade
against homosexuality into the world of sports Sunday in a
printed debate with ex-football player Dave Kopay, which
appeared on the Forum page of the New York Daily News.

Bryant and Kopay, an admitted gay, argued the question
of whether homosexual athletes tarnish the image of
sports.

Bryant said the role of athletes in our society is a highly
visible one and with our “system of hero worshippers. ..the
general public, especially the young, are encouraged to
emulate those prominent figures in the sports world.

“As the mother of four children, I certainly do not want
them to emulate an immoral person——-heterosexual or
homosexual. It is the right of the reasoning public to set
standards and limits on the expression of personal life
styles or actions which are questionable or objectionable.”

Kopay, who played for almost 10 seasons as a running
back in the National Football League, wondered if
opposition to gays in sports wasn’t really a conflict in
terms.

“...It’s funny about athletes,” he said. “On one level
they are totally denying homosexual feelings...totally into
being masculine. But when you're into being totally
masculine, into yourself, isn’t that homosexuality?

“It seems like morality has been deﬁned and taught to
us only in terms of monogamous heterosexuality. Any
other expression of human sexuality is sinful and not
moral. If that is the deﬁnition of morality, then there is
little wonder why we have so much dishonesty and lack of
integrity and character in our society. People are not being
honest with themselves.”

State College student was killed and four other persons
injured in a ﬁre at the Sigma Pi fraternity house, the Butler
County coroner's office reported.

The coroner's ofﬁce identiﬁed the dead youth s James
Steel, 20, of McLean, Va. His body was found near a
second-floor window. V

The ﬁre, which caused about $15,000 damage to the
wooden structure, broke out about 6 a.m. Saturday. Eight
persons were inside the building.

Three students sustained minor injuries and were
treated and released at Grove City Hospital, along with a
volunteer ﬁreman who suffered smoke inhalation.

One of the students was hurt when ‘he leaped from a
second-floor window. Two other students sustained cuts
and other injuries when they tried to enter, the burning
building to save Steel.

Volunteer ﬁreman brought the ﬁre under control within
an hour.

The cause of the blaze was under investigation.

Local Girl Sets World Mark

FORT WORTH, Texas—With all the world-class track
and ﬁeld athletes around, it was a 16-year-old schoolgirl
from Joe Namath’s hometown who stole the show at
Saturday night's indoor meet between the United States
and Russia. ~

Candy Young, a high school junior at Beaver Falls, Pa.,
captivated the crowd of 9,218, in Tarrant Countv

Convention Center with her explosive start in the 60-yard
women’s hurdles race—the ﬁrst event of the evening.

She had a clear lead at the ﬁrst hurdle, and the roar grew
as she moved down the wooden track and hit the tape in
7.27 seconds, far under the world record of 7.5 seconds she
set a week earlier at the AAU Indoor Championships at
Madison Square Garden.

It was the ﬁrst of three world indoor records to be set or
tied during the meet, which ended with the United States a
narrow 121-118 overall winner. The U.S. men won 75-66
and the Russian women won 52-46.

Russia’s Lyndmila Storezhkova ran the 60-yard dash in
6.63 seconds as the ﬁrst three ﬁnishers all beat the old
mark of 6.72.

And Dan Ripley of San Jose State made the highest
indoor vault ever, a leap of 18 feet 53/4 inches.

History of Abortion Presented

:‘The History of Abortion Law” will be presented by Pat
Miller, at the March 13th meeting of the Squirrel Hill
chapter of the National Organization for Women at 8:30

p.m. in the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition, 2012 Murry
Avenue.

Miller will discuss the efforts that legalized abortion; the
opposition and its tactics prior to 1973 and since the
legalization of abortion; the climate of the country
surrounding the issue now; and the future of the freedom
to choose.

Miller is a partner with the law ﬁrm of Wilder and
Miller and is a well-known advocate of abortion rights.

  Welcome to
Bureacuracyi

..

If Pitt’s radio station converts to an open-air for-
mat and becomes an educational station; if the
Student Union renovations include an auditorium, a

newsstand and improved food services in the

recreation room; if the Pig Union Programming
Council's operations meet with more success than the
original’s and especially if students have control over
the union renovations, then the university will see the
goals of newly elected Student Government Board
president Stan Galanski realized. '

It is unfair to attack Galanski’s creative and
worthy plans on principle, but a healthy dose of
cynicism is the prescribed medicinegfor dealing with
Pitt’s bureaucracy and no one should know better
than Galanski, a veteran of a past administration.

A particularly bright idea is that of a Student
Union board that would permit students to have con-
trol over the building and how the money is spent.
Certainly it makes sense that since students are
paying for the renovations, they should be able to
have a voice in what exactly is done to the union.
And, admittedly, he is practical in pointing out that
the Student Government Board does not have the

that Pitt is not the Land of Oz and dealing with the

brass and wrestling through redtape is no simple skip

along some yellow brick road to success. Creative
ideas are adime a dozen but so few of them are ever
given a chance.

We hope Galanski gets his chance. The relative
inexperience of his board (except for Helen Gianella
and Todd Park) has often been discussed and the
susceptibility of novices has been frequently pointed
Out. -

But with inexperience comes fresh concepts——
many of them infeasible, but sometimes, just
sometimes, one surfaces that is perfectly clear in its
. simplicity.

So it is with Galanski and his plans for the union
board.

Now that the warnings have been repeated and
past failures reminded, we want to wish Galanski
well.

Administration Finds Ways to Beat the System

It is clear the university
administration is numb to student
input and obviously has no concern
for student interest. This is
strongly evident in the case
concerning the Alternative Curricu-
lum program. Once the university
administration has made a decision
it creates the facade of a
democratic process. If the result of
the democratic process expresses
the wishes of the administration,
the case is closed.

If the administration holds a
strong view concerning an issue

. ' and the democratic process oppos-

es the administration’s preordain-
ed position, the administration
pulls strings, pulls cards off the
bottom of the deck and strongarms
the immediate opposition. Its
shady escapades always result in
the impositicyi of its will, and there
isno room for question because the
decision was reached “democrati-

cally" and is therefore in “proper
standing."

The administration's “proper
standing” allows illegal vote
changes to its favor outside of
public meetings and behind the
backs of students. Concerning the
program, College of Arts and
Sciences Council member Dee
Ashliman originally cast an ab-
staining vote. The next day,
Ashliman’s vote was counted as a
no_vote, changing the outcome of
the vote, formerly in favor of the
continuation and strengthening of
the program and now allowing CAS
Dean Irwin Schulman’ the pleasure
of terminating the program.

When another council member
expressed the wish to change his
casted no vote to a vote in favor,
Schulman declared the change of
vote would have no impact on the
administration’s desires. Then,
realizing that he could not get away
with such unusual and dubious

behavior, Schulman backed off to
let the original outcome of the vote
stand.

Obviously, the entire process
designed to evaluate the program
proved to be a sham. Schulman
showed no intention of continuing
it, seemingly under the inﬂuence of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg. In fact, it
was not listed in the CAS course
descriptions or time schedule,
proving that the administration had
made its final decision back in
January, before the question was
raised openly. _

Schulman originally kicked off
the process of evaluation. claiming
the program was not economically
feasible. This argument was
refuted by economics Professor
David B. Houston's analysis, which
explained that the program is, in
fact, quite inexpensive. The cost

per credit hour proved parallel to. if ‘

   

IF THE GOVERNMENT \A/ANTS
TO SEE SOME REAL CRATERS,
THEY SHOULD LOOK AT OUR

      

not less than, the normal cost per
credit hour throughout CAS.

Schulman then geared his attack _

towards the academic quality of the
program. This/was largely refuted
by students and faculty, both from
within and outside of Alternative
Curriculum, although everybody
agreed‘ it could use a more
structured form of academic
evaluation.

In the event of a vote in favor of
the program, Schulman promised
to uphold the decision and recruit
support for the program. That was
a blatant lie. Schulman anticipated

a vote in favor of terminating the

program and did everything in his

power to encourage such a
decision. When the vote resulted
in council support for Alternative
Curriculum. Schulman came out
with the statement to the effect that
the decision was now up to his
“boss,” Rosenberg.

With the support of Student
Government Board, another vote
will probably result with CAS
Council declaring support. once
again, for Alternative Curriculum.
The real question is whether or not

the dictatorial tactics of Schulman.

and Rosenberg will be allowed to
spit in the face of student interest.

Three Way Split, _
An Educational Polemic

I am writing as a result of a
recent disagreement concerning
interpretations of the Iranian
situation between political science
Professor Richard Cottam and
Professor Sussman of the (biologi-
cal sciences) department. This
exchange triggered a defensive

rebuke by Professor Bert Rockmang,

who hinted that his interpretation
of the conditions in Iran supports
Cottam’s analysis.

This three-way interaction could
have been quite an educational
polemic for the students. But,
unfortunately, Rockman only men-
tions in passing that he éould, (if he
chose) address the substance of
Sussman’s argument and expose
his many errors.

Instead of making this effort he
chooses to rebuke. Sussman for
venturing outside his departmental
turf.

Perhaps since Rockman and I are
sharing the same ‘disciplinary
niche, political science (although at

attempting to address

different status levels), he will
grant that I have some limited
legitimacy to address him.

I should like to ask Rockman how
the, political education of the
layman—-student, natural science
teacher or working man--is served
by calling him “presumptuous” for
political
questions.

Such an exchange between
professors seems to be an
expression of a disturbing non-
integrational approach to educa-
tion, one which through jargon and
information monopoly finds it
easier -to perpetuate the dissemin-
ation of information. But, I am not
an education major: and it is, of
course, presumptuous for me to
speculate further. A simple call.to
an expert in the education
department should get me, the
correct. up-to-date view on the
matter.

Letters  
Coordinator Critizes Administrative Decisions

I was glancing through the
course description newspaper and
time schedule for the fall term and
it came to my attention that the
Alternative Curriculum program
had been omitted from both. I
found this to be curious for’ two
reasons. First of all, the time
schedules and course description
newspapers went to the printer at
the end of January or beginning of
February, roughly three weeks
before CAS Council voted on the
future of the program.

Secondly, ‘before these items
went to press. we speciﬁcally urged
Dean Schulman to list the program
since it was unclear, at least in our
minds, how the CAS Council would
vote. As far as we knew, he had
agreed to do so.

This raises two questions in my

mind that I leave open to the

university community and espec-
ially the members of CAS Counci
to deal with: ‘

At the onset ofthe evaluation,
Dean Schulman stated that he
would evaluate the program from
an “objective,” “neutral” posi-
tion. Furthermore, he stated and
was quoted in The Pitt News
(2/23/79) that “if Council votes to
continue the Alternative
Curriculum program I'll take that
as a mandate to do as much as I
possibly can to convince Dean
Rosenberg to continue the pro-
gram.”

Dog Gone Mad

I would like to direct this letter to
all my fellow Pitt students who sat
in the Civic Arena last Saturday
night. Not only were we outclassed
on the courts by Rutgers but we
were by far outclassed in the
stands! The crazy people sitting in
the seats above the backboards
throwing beer and soda really
proved their worth. These idiots
soaked more Pitt fans than Rutgers
fans. When a dog has gone mad, it
can't identify friend or foe, can it?’

ISSUES AND AN OCCASIONAL ANSWER...

PITT NEWS ‘EDITOR/AL COMMENTA RIES

é‘

When I first moved to the
Pittsburgh area I was told that the
people here had bad attitudes
about losing. In other words, if you
can't win the game fair and square,
retaliation is the only resort.
Whatever happens to “May the
best man/team win?” It’s really
too bad some people are sore
losers. Maybe they deserve to lose.

expect us to believe, in the light of
the above information, that he
operated in good faith in this
evaluation? It seems that the
decision to eliminate AC was made
long before CAS Council consid-
ered it.

What is the point of having
faculty and student input in the
decision-making process if the
decisions are being made by the
administrators based on their own
criteria anyway? CAS Council, in a
situation like this, isn’t even

performing its supposed advising
function. It isn't able to do
anything at all.

A Further Look In to PMAP

In your Feb. 26 issue, an article
appeared that explained the Peer
Medical Aide Program (PMAP)
and its services to the student
body. As director, I would like to
thank The Pitt News for its
exposure of our organization.
Many students who need our
service don’t realize the availability
when in need. But it is imperative
that a few misleading statements
which appeared in the article be
clarified at this time.

With the advent of recent
occurrences in the dorms, the
public may have been misled by the
statement in which Peer Medical
Aides were being trained to handle
major medical emergencies such as
“gunshot wounds.” Aides are not
specifically trained to deal with
major emergencies such as this.
Our training is such that we are
taught how to handle any medical
emergency which could possibly
arise—be it on campus or wherever
an aide should choose to work.

As Emergency Medical Techni-
cians (EMT) and Advanced First
Aiders, we are limited in our
treatment capabilities. We can only
treat the symptoms and act as basic
life supporters until the patient can
be seen by a physician. Aides, in
most cases, do refer a patient to a

perogative, based on our medical
limitations, to have the freedom to
advise. I stress that we must have a
valid reason for the course of action
taken.

The campus police have a staff of
approximately 35 EMTs who are
very competent in the field and are
more than willing to be of service.
Despite their concern for, and
willingness to help students, many
people in need do not realize this
and feel threatened by a police
officer. Because of this, we are able
to offer something as peers, to the
students, who don't realize the
campus police officers’ position.
Although the article may have been
misleading, cases related to these
situations do not necessarily
involve criminal incidents (i.e.,
injuries sustained through vandal-
ism, alcohol-related.)

The health, risk profile, a

questionnaire completed by new
students, is aimed solely to make
students aware of their current
health risks and to inform them of
the possible consequences. It is not
implemented in order to persuade
people to change their lifestyles.
We are not asking people to change
their lives, but we are trying to
educate them about factors which
may deprive them of a normal
healthy life.

Finally, the Peer Medical Aide
Program provides first-hand pract-
ical experiences for students
interested in a health related
profession, but it is by no means a
“stepping stone” into professional
schools. Many past members have
entered professional schools but
surely not by token of this merit
alone. -

. The Bee Gee’s latest album,
“Spirits Having Flown,” presents
the listener with two styles of
music. The new Bee Gees style is
present enforce on side one and the
ﬁrst cut on side two. The old-style
Bee Gees can be found in the last
four cuts on the second side.

It should be noted that “Spirits
Having Flown” is a rather
premature release. Radio stations
received promotional copies and
the album received extensive air
play prior to its scheduled
commercial release.

‘The ﬁrst side includes tracks that
are presently enjoying air time on
both AM and FM. These cuts are
“Tragedy,” “Too Much Heaven”
(the proceeds of this single will go '

Out,” “Reaching Out,” and the
title track, “Spirits (Having

x ‘All in the Family’ -— Television ’s Innovator

By PHILIP CONTES
Pitt News Staff Writer

Sunday night, Norman Lear, Archie, Edith, Meathead,
Gloria, two hundred guests, and by miracle of television,
all America, celebrated the 200th episode of that institution
of top ten prime time ratings, “All in the Family.”

Lear was applauded as some sort of David, who took on
the Goliath of ' mediocrity and play-it-safe television
programming and developed instead a televison show that
dared to attack the entire range of social ills, including
prejudice, discrimination, the Vietnam War, Nixon and
others that were, and still are, present in American society.

Lear chose the weapon of comedy, gambling on the
presumption that Americans were willing to take a long
hard look at themselves and their institutions——church,

. government and family relationships——and laugh at what

they saw.

By SAM ROSSI

Lear won hands down. The long line of mature and
realistic situation comedies spawned by “All in the
Family” are testimony to his victory. In the television
industry imitation is the clearest indicator of success.

But this may be the last season for “All in the Family"
because cast members want to move on and because of

A contract disputes and declining ratings. It is now time to

take a look at what has been attempted and what has been
accomplished.

Immediately, it must be admitted that Lear, through
“All in the Family,” opened up a gigantic range of topics
that couldn’t have been touched before, not because
Americans weren’t ready for such things on television, but
because the industry was not ready to present them.

Issues such as prejudice, discrimination, rape,
impotence and other societal and personal problems had

 Eddie Gives Money’sWorth But No Surprises

never been shown before. The rule of the industry is to go
with what has already worked.

This is the attitude that dampens creativity and the
desire to take risks. Once Lear had successfully brought
these issues to television, others were free to raise the
same issues.

But, the immitators and perhaps even the play-it-safe
attitude came back to hurt “All in the Family.” Lear ran
out of issues he could safely focus on without alienating his

I audience and .Americans became just a bit bored with

television bringing societal ills into the living room.

“All in the Family” began to lose its vigor and power,
becoming just another amusing sit-com. But, the initial
importance of Lear’s effort can't be denied. Perhaps the
presentation of television’s red letter events such as
“Roots” or “Holocaust” can be traced to Lear’s initial
bravado. For that, Lear is to be applauded, for he alone

Life For the Taking

‘ Eddie Money

Columbia

The new Eddie Money release,
“Life For the Taking,” is as good
an album as Money’s debut album.
One may even say that both albums
were cut from a cloth royale——
which is where the trouble with
“Life For the Taking” lies.

Money showed limitless“poten-
tial on V his first release. Unfor-
tunately, much of that potential is

not realized on his new release. To
say the least, “Life For the
Taking” is conservative. There is
nothing here that wasn’t on
Money’s initial album. There is one
noticeable difference though; “Life
For the Taking” is unmistakably
tainted with disco. With the
exception of that “intermittent
disco, Money takes no chances.

All the material on “Life for the
Taking” ‘was either written or
co-written by Money. Less empha-

, sis is put on the collaboration

between guitarist Jimmy Lyon and
Money than-on-the debut release.

Money also threw in some crack,
studio musicians on this album.
Present are Lonnie Turner from the
Steve Miller Band, with the
omnipresent Tom Scott, David
Lindley from Jackson Browne’s
back-up band and’ Rolling Stones
studio "keyboardist, Nicky Hop-
kins.

“Life For the Taking” opens
with three driving up-tempo
rockers, “Life For the Taking,”
“Can’t Keep a Good, Man Down”
and “Nightmare.” Lyon's lead
guitar work is showcased along

with Money’s" hard, passionate _j

vocals on this opening trio.
“Gimme Some Water” starts out
as a blues’ number but eventually
evolves into another rocker. “Rock
and Roll the Place” brings side one

to a brisk, up-tempo close.

“Maybe I’m a Fool” is a
disco-oriented rocker. Typical of a
Top 40 release, 'it’s complete with
token string arrangements and
infectious dance rhythm.

“Love the Way You Love Me” is
a semi-soul tune accented by
Mone_v_’s vocals. Following it is
probably the best offering from the

album, “Maureen.” It’s arranged
in the grand tradition of early rock
’n’ roll, complete with harp, horns
and handclaps and offset appropri-
ately by Money’s vocals.

“Nobody” is done much in the
same vein as “Maureen” and
represents another of the standouts
on “Life For the Taking.” The
album closes with a blues number
titled “Call On Me.” A

Money’s debut album was
typical of mainstream fresh air rock
’n’ roll. “Life For the Taking”
seems stuffy and stagnant.

V (Continued front page 10) L
opened the door, however slightly, for others who would
take risks with the powerful medium, television.

Lear, however, had another goal in mind. “All in the’

Family” was supposed to be a mirror held in front of the
American people. Lear hoped that he could show
Americans to themselves with the character of Archie
Bunker, a representative of all that is American, and spur
people to change their faults. .

Lear’s noble effort failed. Archie Bunker became an
object of ridicule. Americans were blind to the Archie
Bunker in themselves. -Somehow he became remote from
American. People all knew someone “just like Archie” but
no one saw any Archie in themselves. He was too
outrageous, too ridiculous, too funny.

I In the end Lear summed it up: Archie with all his
opinions was no more than “a horse’s ass.” The line drew
laughter on Sunday’s show, proving just how clouded the
mirror that Lear held has become. Even Learjhimself has
misdirected the focus. Archie was not an all-American. At

3 ‘Family’ and Lear -- Television ’s F ines

least no one sees him that way anymore.
People tend to see ourselves more in the character of

. Michael, the meathead. Anyone ridiculed by Archie had to

be a good guy. Mike was always on the right and rational
side of the issues. He had his faults, but at least he was a
good, intelligent liberal, and there was no threat if one
identified with him. After all he was definitely one of the
80 percent of Americans who say they voted for McGovern
in 1972, a far sighted good guy if there ever was one. But,
there’s the catch—“All in the Family” hoped to show us
the bad side in ourselves—not the good.

There is one redeeming factor in this failure. As time
and the series continued Mike and everyone else learned to
accept and understand Archie Bunker. *

In a film clip aired Sunday, Mike realizes the origin of
Archie’-s prejudices in the example set by his father.

“Your father was wrong,” Mike challenges.

Archie replies, “How could a person who loves you do
anything wrong-?”

A look of confusion, then enlightenment and ultimately

acceptance and understanding crosses Mike's face.

Archie is portrayed at his best in his numerous moments
of tenderness and love when his basic goodness, his
strength and constancy show. Hismoments with Edith
when she was nearly raped, or when she thought she had
cancer, are perfect examples.

His scene with Gloria before her wedding cannot be
forgotten.

' “You’ll always be my little girl,” he tells her.

That was Archie's power. He was a rock, a rock with
faults’, but nonetheless a rock on which to build a new
family and a new future. Although people never saw
Archie in themselves, they at least learned to accept and
understand the Archie in others.

And ultimately, Americans were able to say, along with
Mike as he prepared to leave the Bunker household,
“Archie, you always thought I hated you, but I don’t. I
love you.”

That was Archie Bunker’s and perhaps “All in the
Family’s” finest hour.

Bar Setting No Place for Big-Name Concerts

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE
Pitt News Staff Writer V
The most recent entertainment
innovation in Oakland has been the
implementation of bringing rela-
tively popular performers, such as
(the Ramones and Steve Forbert, to
Oakland pubs in order to appease
the talent-hungry as well as thirsty
music fans in Pittsburgh. Too
many people are turned off by the
prospects of having to deal with a
teeny-bopper or drug-oriented
audience at a large theater or arena
in order to ‘ see their favorites
perform on stage.

THE SENTINEL

While the concept of a more
mature setting in which to see top
acts do their thing is indeed a good
one, the actual implementation of
the shows, in my opinion, has been
a total bust in Oakland.

I’m not complaining about the
performers, and I admire the
promoters who do their best to
provide us with the acts we want to
see in different, more - casual
settings. The reason that the whole
situation stinks is because of two
simple reasons: the bars are out to
take advantage of their patrons,
and, a bar is not the best place to

merits of watching a show at a pub
is even more depressing. First of
all, you are dealing with limited
seating—very limited seating. Be
prepared to fight in order to get a
good seat. Once you ﬁnd a table,
the dilemma of who gets to sit with
their back to the stage becomes a
problem. Once the show starts,
you get to‘ see the group or

make on the table of girls sitting in

It is clear that the idea of good
live acts in Oakland with name
performers is not really feasible. In
fact, it is a very poor way to see a
top-notch, professional act. High
prices and poor viewing conditions,
in my mind, easily overcome the
advantages of being able to drink
in a mature, casual atmosphere.
Your best bet would be to try and
sneak a bottle in the next time you
go with your teeny-bopper crowd to
the Stanley. The inconveniences
are just not worth it.

while this may sell well on slick
ﬂuorescent paper in the poster

Perhaps the flaw of the book lies
in the fact that Jong uses themes of
nature rather than sexuality. The
latter tone has generally sustained
Jong’s brightest-kid-in-the-class

stance.

But in “At the Edge of the

You can almost hear the violins in the background.
It’s been less than a week since West Virginia
basketball coach Gale Catlett proclaimed after his
team’s semi-final Eastern Eight loss to Rutgers “This
league can't compare to the Metro Seven. It’s a joke.
It’s bush league.” It’s tough to feel sorry for him,

though.

nati with less than a clean slate concerning NCAA
rule violations. ..

——while at Cincinnati was so incensed over the Bear-
cats’ loss to Pitt at the Field House in ’77 he declared
he would never return to play Pitt on the Panthers’
home court again...

Carlton Novarson (shown here against Rutgers) was part of the most successful Eastern Eight tournament thus far.

——argued Rutgers’ star James Bailey should have 7

been thrown out of the Eastern Eight semi-final for
throwing elbows when his Mountaineers aren’t exac-
tly candidates for any good sportsmanship award.

Catlett also asserted that WVU has been “asked 15
times to join the Metro Conference.” As Cincinnati
head coach, Catlett won two consecutive Metro
championships, a league that includes Cincinnati,
Memphis State and Georgia Tech. How “Metro” an
area Morgantown may be is debatable, but what
would Mountaineer fans do without Pitt and
Duquesne to harangue?

If WVU cannot tolerate such an obviously “bush”
league which, after all, is only three years old, then
maybe the Mountaineers might enjoy playing
Louisville instead of Pitt in football too.

Fortunately, WVU athletic director Richard Mar—
tin is not quite as hasty to pack up and leave the
Eastern Eight. Martin extended an official apology
to the league and assured everyone that, while Catlett
may reign as czar of Mountaineer basketball, he still
has quite a way to go before anyone will allow him to
say whether or not his team will play in. such—and—
such a conference. »

Despite the criticisms of Catlett and George
Washington coach Bob Tallent (who wasn’t thrilled
with the officiating in Pitt’s first—round win over the
Colonials) the Eastern Eight tournament was an all-
around success.

Total attendance was over 50,000 with 16,009 fans
attending the championship game at the Civic Arena.
The enormous turnout for the semi-final and final
rounds is even more remarkablewhen one considers
only one of the two local “host” teams made it as
far. 1

Statistically speaking for the regular league games,
Sam Clancy led all rebounders with 10.7 per game,
followed by Massachusett’s Mark“ Haymore with a
9.6 average. West Virginia super guard Lowes
Moore easily led all scorers with a 21.5 average.

Moore has said he wants to put his name on the NBA a

hardship list so that he could turn pro next year. If
this should happen, maybe Gale Catlett might need
that violin background music after all.

Panther Skaters Sink Navy Midshipmen, ,6-3 and 7-6

By JIM NELSON

ANNAPOLIS, Md.--The Pitt

hockey team, paced by forwards,

Curt Hetz and Tom Sherwin,
defeated Navy, 6-3 and 7-6, last
weekend in the squad’s season
ﬁnale at Dalgrehn Hall Arena.
Hetz earned two goals and three
assists over the weekend to help

-the Panthers down the Midship-

men in the two-game opener, 6-3,
while Sherwin scored a hattrick to

second stanza with assists from
Hetz and Clif Ziegler. The
Panthers then tied the score, 3-3, at
7:54 when Sherwin scored on a
breakaway, thanks to a pass from
defenseman Al Zangrilli.

Navy had two two-man advan-
tages late in the period, but
couldn't score.

Pitt put the game away in the
third period, tallying three goals-
one by Bill Gedeon at 7:43 to -give
the Panthers the lead, 4-3, one by

Baseball Team Out to Shine on Diamond

By KAREN KADILAK
P:" \t‘\\\ Rial" V\'ritr-r

Pitt's baseball team (ll-l7-l last
season) has begun practice and will
open its season March 17 at West
Virginia.

“The guys have been throwing
around for the past week or two,”
coach Bobby Lewis said. “We’ve
been practicing in the dirt area at
Trees Hall.

“Practicing there, we really
haven't been able to hit or even
throw as much as we would like,”
“But, for now.

it's the only place where we can
work out.

“The facilities that we normally
use (both the small and large gyms
in Trees Hall) are being used for
some of the winter sports."

Lewis added. however. that his
team “is enthusiastic under the
circumstances" and is looking
forward to its season opener.

“We're hoping that all the snow
is gone and that they (West
Virginia) will have their ﬁeld
ready,” the Panther coach said.

Pitt was not supposed to open its
season until later this month, but a

scheduling conflict dictated that
the West Virginia game, originally
slated for April, be played earlier.

The Panthers are scheduled to
play 33 games (19 at home and 14
away) this spring, but Lewis doubts
whether they will play that many.
Inclement weather in the past has
made it difficult for Pitt to play
more than 30.

Highlighting the Panther sched-
ule is an appearance in the Eastern
Eight tournament to be held. in
Hershey April 21 and 22, and a
game in Cleveland's Municipal
Stadium against Cleveland State

May 11.

Also scheduled is a road trip to
the Charlottesville, Va. area, where
Pitt will meet Virginia, Virginia
Military Institute, James Madison,
and Bridgewater College. Sched-
uled for this month, the trip had yet
to be approved by the Pitt athletic
department last week.

BASEBALL NOTES: With the

season opener less than two weeks '

away, Pitt is still holding tryouts.
Forty-ﬁve players are now practic-
ing, but only 25 will make the ﬁnal
cut that will be held soon.

Srakocic photo

Sherwin scored twice in the
second period—on passes from
Stump and Ziegler at 0:45 to give
Pitt a 6-4 advantage. Hetz’ second

8031. at 16:48, allowed the
Panthers a 7-4 lead and, despite
two third—period Navy goals, Pitt
hung on for the win.

Three weeks ago, the women’s

Princeton Relays for ladies. The
Pantherettes did their best all year
and they hope to top. that Princeton
performance this weekend as they
return to Princeton for the third

Menspikers in Inaugural Season

By MICHAEL KORPOSH

If one word were to describe the
University of Pittsburgh men’s
volleyball team this year, that word
would have to be inexperience.

But as coach Mike Hebert stated
in a recent interview, “The only
way to gain experience is through
hard work and quality court
competition.” Competition is
hardly the word for what Hebert
has faced the Panthers with this
year.

Hebert scheduled a recent
weekend tournament with the likes
of Ohio State (NCAA finalist last
year), Kellogg Community College
(junior college champion last year),
George Williams College (NAIA
champion last year) and two top
ﬁve Canadian powerhouses, Uni-

member of the 880-yard relay team
and individually, Murray will enter
the open 220 while Palmer will
compete in her specialty, the
hurdles, and the 60-yard dash.

Last season, Murray and Palmer
placed in these outdoor events,
although Palmer, of course, did not
run 60 yards outdoors.

The jumping events have always
been a strong area for Pitt,
with Marie Ribik and Pam Gearing
in the high jump, and Cissy
Wilborn and Kim Green in the long
jump. All four have an excellent
chance of placing.

The Pantherette relays‘ will also
be a strong point. Murray, Palmer,
Wilborn and Linda Mitchell com-
prise the 880-relay; Murray,
Mitchell, Karen Krichko and Lisa
Haupt will run the mile relay. while
the two-mile relay consists of
Karen Bradley, Maria Sciullo,
Brenda Chorpenning and Jane
Strause.

versity of Guelph Ontario and
Western Ontario.

“The only way to get better is to
do so with a difficult and

demanding schedule,” statedi

Coach Hebert, “and I am halfway
pleased with the progress of the
team so far. I could have scheduled
so we would be 15-2 right now, but
that in no way would improve the
team.” .
Hebert’s squad includes many
athletes that carry with them
impressive volleyball credentials.
Freshman Arnie Matthews from
Peabody High School played with
the East team at the national
pre-Olympic trial games this
summer. Scott Robbins, a recent
transfer from volleyball power

setters on the court, while veteran
senior captain Scott Hoffmann
offers leadership and much needed
experience to the lineup.

Hebert, who follows an “educa-
ted coach”-type model similar to
that of Nebraska football head Tom
Osborne, received his Ph.D. from
Indiana University and was set to
teach history/ philosophy at nearby
Chatham College. But an interest
in volleyball, and an opening in the
athletic department at Pitt brought
him here in 1976 to coach
volleyball. Originally raised in
southern California, where volley-
ball is a popular local pastime,
Hebert now tries to bring much of
his knowledge to a group of men,
many of whom are just beginning
to learn the intricacies of the game.

Randolph Uses Ridicule

To Improve Her Game a

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staffwriter

It was ridicule that first incited
Pantherette basketball star Wanda

Randolph to take up a sport that)

has become her way of life for the
past 10 years.

“I had some interest in the
game, but not much knowledge,”
said Randolph. “My problem was
that I just couldn’t seem to put the
ball in the hoop.”

At first, Randolph saw very little
action. The coach of the first team
she ever played for was looking for
good shooters, not just height,
which was the only thing Randolph
had going for her at the time.

“I always sat on the bench until
this one game,” said Randolph. ‘I
was down court all by myself when
I was thrown a long pass. I took
three shots and missed every one.”

After that performance, people
started talking about Randolph;
she was tall, they said, but couldn’t
play basketball. The talk made
Randolph determined to play well.

She purchased a basketball and
started to practice shooting, some-
times until 1 a.m. Eventually, her
game improved and Randolph
began to excel over all her
teammates who had been quick to
ridicule her. '

In her junior year of high school,
Randolph led her Yonkers (N .Y.)
High School team to a state
championship.

Following that season, she did

something that had been a dream
of hers for along time—she tried
out for the United States Olympic
team. ',
“I was playing in an AAU league
and I was gaining a good‘ deal of
experience,” said, Randolph. “My
coach was encouraging me to try
out so, without a sponsor, I took the
trip to Connecticut. I was cut the
first round, which really hurt my
pride.”

Randolph’s pride may have been
injured but the defeat made her
play all the harder.

During two seasons at Pitt,
Randolph scored an amazing 1050
points to become Pitt’s first woman
basketball player to score over

Harris. This would give her the
highest number of points scored by
any Pitt basketball player, male or
female.

Randolph also became the first
player ever to be named by the
Pittsburgh basketball writers as
“Woman Player of the Year”
following her sophomore season.

This season was disappointing,

Randolph said. She did, however,
set a woman’s Field-House record
of 3l‘points. She described the
situation.

“I was having a terrible first
half, only scoring six points. So I
went into the locker room and did a
lot of thinking. I was determined to

go back out there and score.”

And score she did, making 25¢

points in the second half. The
season wasn’t as successful as
Randolph, however.

“This is the worst season I’ve
ever had in my life. l’ve never
been on a team that has lost so
many games,” Randolph said.

Most students play by the rules
when placing a long distance
call. They take advantage ot bar-
gain rates and make their calls
during the discount periods. If
you're notsure when you can call
at discount rates, check your
phone book. a

A few students think it's O.K. to
break the rules by stealing their
telephone calls. They're not beat-
ing the system, they're taking
advantage ot all of us, because it
drives up the cost of providing
