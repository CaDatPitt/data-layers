Impeachment Resolutions 1
Referred to Judiciary Comm.

WASHINGTON AP The
House of Representatives yes-
terday began preliminary inquiry
into whether President Nixon

. . should be impeached.

The first of several resolutions
calling‘ for impeachment was
introduced at 12:12 p.m.' by Rep.
Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif.

House Speaker Carl Albert
referred those and other related

A ‘ resolutions to the House Judiciary

Committee, whose chairman an-

nounced he would begin a

preliminary investigation. g
"Chairman Peter W. Rodino,-

D-N.J., said “events of the past -

few days lead us little choice at this

_ time but to move ahead with

preparation for impeachment pro-
ceedings.”

He referred to‘ Nixon’s ﬁring or‘
special Watergate prosecutor

-. '75. Soyuz-Apollo Flight

Archibald Cox. —
Rodinoﬁsaid the committee's

probe is in “The preliminary stage.

to inquire whether or not there is
evidence to establish -an impeach-
able offense." '

' A Albert announced even before

the House convenedat noon that he
would refer impeachment’ resolu-
tions to the Judiciary Committee.

He cautioned against hasty or,

reckless action.

Albert, who is currently next in
line to succeed the President if
Nixon is removed from office, also
called for quick action on the
nomination of Rep. Gerald R. Ford
to fill the vacant office of vice

- president. .

Ford said he still supports the
President and doesn't believe the
Coxﬁring warrants impeachment.

Prof. Heocls Space

BY KARL BALDYS
Dr. Thomas Donahue, Pitt
physics professor and consultant on

-. the 1975 Soyuz,-Apollo spaceﬂight,
with-'

said he would consider
drawing ‘as head of his research

team if political repression inside -

the USSR intensiﬁed.

Donahue’s research group. de-_

signed an experiment tomeasure
the constituents of the upper
atmosphere, particularly the ato-
mic nitrogen. and oxygen levels.
“The increased repression of
scientists and concerned citizens
inside the Soviet Union poses a

serious moral problem for me,"

said Donahue. “I think it isa direct
result of their expanded foreign

- policy."

However, Donahue is still
actively engaged in the project and
the event or events that would
signal his withdrawal are ‘unde-
ﬁned.

The experiment, devised by
Donahue and Dr. Michael McElroy
of Harvard, involves the placement
of two mirrors on the Soyuz craft
and an ultraviolet light source and
detector on the Apollo.

As the two space craft pass each
other, at distances varying from
several‘ meters to several kilo-
meters, the Apollo will direct an
ultraviolet light beam at‘ the Soyuz.
Mirrors will reflect the beam back
to a detector on the Apollo.

By registering the amount of
light absorbed in the beam's round
trip the scientists hope to evaluate
the levels of oxygen and nitrogen.

Donahue said a recent con-
ference in Russia was necessary to

determine if the Soviet scientists
would agree to mount mirrors on

the Soyuz. “I was concerned that

the manuevering ‘power of ‘the
Soyuz would be diminished by the

. mirrors,” Donahue noted. _
Although his trip secured the"

experiment, Donahue was im-
pressed by the» scenes he wit-
nessed.‘ “We were treated royally.
Every night we were taken to
dinner, or the Bolshoi, and we even
made a trip to Rostov, an ancient
Russian city.
“However,‘l'll never forget the

trip to Rostove. We had ‘a’ police

escort. It was a Saturday and we

were racing down ‘these rather
primitive roads at a great speed

' while the normal weekend trafﬁc

was forced off the road by our
drivers." ‘

Donahue did not decry the recent
cutbacks of the manned spacecraft
program. .

“I have always advocated a
program that emphasized ’auto-
mated equipment. satellites and
probes, rather than manned
missions. However, I think many

, good things were accomplished by

09

the manned program.

Donahue felt the $3.3 billion
annually expended on the manned
program was not extravagant when
compared to the total budget,

especially the military budget. He

emphasized his scientific pre-
ference for unmanned rather than
manned flight.

On .Pitt's involvement in the
National Aeronautic and Space
Administration '(NASA) /program.
Donahue said, “I don't think most

‘WASHINGTON AP --President
Nixon capitulated Tuesday amid
constitutional crisis and agreed to
surrender Watergate-related tape
recrodingsi and documents to a
federal judge.

The abrupt and astounding
tumabout came hours" after the
House of Representatives took .the
first formal steps that could lead to
impeachment. ’ ' _

“This President does not defy the
law," Charles Alan Wright,
Nixon's lawyer said in announcing
that Nixon will comply in full with a
U.S. Court of Appeals order
requiring him to deliver the tapes.

The President’s earlier refusaltto

\ comply with "the order lead to his

ﬁring of special Watergate prose-
cutor Archibald Cox and precipita-

here since 1963." The federal
space program built the Space
Research Center at Pitt and
continues to provide money for

Assisting Donahue on the
proposediexperiment are two Pitt
professors, Drs. Frederick Kauf-
_man and James Anderson. Dr.
Donahue is also head of a scientiﬁc
team that will participate in
planned space missions to Jupiter
_and Saturn in future years.

would affect.the turmoil of recent
days. ‘

Rep. Jerome R. Waldie, D-Calif.,
who introduced the first of several
impeachment resolutions in the
House Tuesday, said- Nixon’s
decision was an indication that the
President intends to comply with
the law. ,But Waldie said he
wouldn’t withdraw his resolution
“until I see thecontents of ‘the
tapes and documents.”

Because the court’ order applies.

only to nine tapes and related
papers, there likely will be further
demands for White House tapes
and documents including Water-
gate. the International Telephone
and Telegraph Corp. antitrust
settlement, milk-price deal and
other matters under, investigation.

Sen. Lawron Chiles, D-Fla., who
introduced .one of several bills
to create a special,
indepentent prosecutor to replace
Cox, said Nixon had taken someof

3 the sting out of the crisis but hadn't

removed the need for an indepen-

,dent prosecution force.

“Thank God,” _said Sen. Barry
Goldwater, R-Ariz., of Nixon’s
decision. ’ "

Ina series of other fast moving
developments that preceded the
President's action: _

--Cox’s lieutenants on -the special
prosecution force met with’ the new
chief of the Administration's
Watergate investigation to deter-
mine whether they should resign

en masse or proceed under his

-leaderhip.

‘Block Diolect: Eclucotionol Dilemmo 

BY MARY BETH KENNEDY

Language affords power to the
dominant and subjects the non-
dominant to conformity said Dr.
Orlando Taylor during the Inter-
cultural House seminar on black
and white English.

According to Taylor, of Federal
City College in Washington, D.C.,
it is “totally absurd to say there is
only one kind of standard or white
English." Due to the regional.
ethnic and educational distinctions
there are an abundance of dialects
in both black and white groups, he
said. ‘

Taylor introduced the historical
signiﬁcance of the black dialect,
and _the classical perception of the
black language.

He said “Black people come
from an oral tradition," noting a
historical continuity of language
from Africa to the New World,

despite much inﬂuence by Euro-
pean languages. '

Taylor attributes degradation of _
. the black [language to the classical

perception which stereotypes the
black way'of speech placing it on
the ‘extreme opposite of standard
English. V
A Citing Taylor's reasoning that
cultural differences produce black
dialects, Audrey Holland of Pitt's
Speech department added, “All
this talk about changing the way
people talk is.a smoke screen.”
Holland believes racism is the
underlying reason for the concern
to develop techniques to change
the language. . - ..
“Time is being spent changing
the mouth of the child. not the ears
of the teacher, which is silly. This
time should be spent_ in —the
development of a non-racial insti-
tution." '

‘Dieaif Editor:

 was interested to‘ see an‘

‘Dispossessed Majority by’ Wilmot
Robertson. About a month ago I
:c°;a_-.n1e across a promotional
.brochure ‘for the same book just
‘outside the entrance to I-lillmaii
Ligbrary. . I was interested in
-reading the book. so I tried to get it
iat..The‘_Book Center". Unfortuna-
tely.-'they neither stock it or take
;oi‘de‘rs for it. In the end. I ordered
the"book directly. enclosing a note
describing my difficulties in getting
the book at any of the local outlets.
".--With my copy. I received a note
' "from the publisher explaining that
{the company had offered the Pitt
Book Center a number of copies on

‘Center hadn't replied. The
publisher suggested that I contact
the Book Center and askthem to
stock theibook. Healso pointed out
-that the Book Center very probably
carries .a book attacking the
“dispossessed majority." namely.
Peter Schrag'is Decline of the

‘Wasp. He'was right in this

prediction.

Robertson’s thesis is simple. He
contends that America owes l its
stature and strength to its original
Majority population. ' As the

‘ homogeiieity of the popuiation was

disrupted--through minority immi-
gration and other pressures--the.
prospects for a‘ true American
culture, declined proportionately.
He believes that the Majority today
finds itself “at bay,” and must
recover its identity if it is to survive
and continue to advance. ,

One doesn't have to agree with...

Robertson's ideas to recognize his
rightlto be heard" and his positions
debated. The book -is over 600
pages in length. thoroughly docu-,

mented with "over 1000 footnotes. ‘

and above all. it represents a
"serious challeng_e to the prevailing
intellectual climate. X ‘

Israeli Stipport

Dear Editor: l_ ‘ ~ _

As Jews and as s-upporters of the
Israeli cause. we strongly disagree
with the YSA article, which
appeared in the~Oct. 19 edition of

the Pitt News. Since we do ‘not V

believe in using rhetoric. a/ndxtriter
phrases-f. we“will limit our" argu-
ments to logic and historical fact.
In 1947, the United. Nations
passed a resolution partitioning

Palestine into two states, one Arab *

and one Jewish.-. The Jews

accepted this partition but the’

governments in Cairo’, Ammna,
and Damascus did not. Within
hours after the declaration of the
Jewish state, the Arab govern-
ments attacked in‘ a concerted
effort to exterminate Israel- and
simultaneousl expropriated the
lands intede .to constitute the
Palestinian state. The major cause
of the_Palestinian refug ees was
the panic wich seized t_em as a

and not. attacked Israel,‘ there

' would be no" Arab refugee problem

today. ‘
The YSA asserts that Israel is

“imperial.istic" because of their"

launching of the 1967 war. and
their subsequent holding of the
captured territories. This assertioni
can be refuted by a brief review of
the events preceding the 6 day war.
First it mtist be stated. that since
1948. an open state of war has
existed between Israel
Arab neighbors. In May I967
Nassar escalated the situation by
ejecting U.N. peace keeping
troops. on station in'Sinai since
1956, and concurrently closing the
straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.
This clearly constitutes an act of

occupied in the l95o',war. Since
none of the ‘guarantees _was kept,
logically Israel can notgive up any
captured land until there is a
directly negotiated peace in the
area. ‘ -

The current Arab aggression, as

all other Arab aggressions, stems 
from a policy of anti-semitism, not.

from a desire to return any land to

the Palestinians.‘_ Previous to 1967, ’

Arab leaders never referred to

‘Israel by name, but always called I

the expressed goal of the annihila-
tion of 2‘/2 million Jewsfgoiiig to

The absurdity of comparing the

exposed. when oneconsiders the

possibility of 2.5 million ‘Jews

 

oppressing 155 million Arabs
stretched across the whole of Asia
Minor and North Africa. it would

 Egypptis Mouivefor war-—
* ii  Preipar-ation for Peace.

BY LEE ivi’ARKoviTz. .

Whydid Egypt go to war against
a more_ powerful Israel?
_ Some claim because the Arabs
wanted to'regain their pride and
international prestige. As one
Arab official recently put it: “We
-want to be taken seriously." Still
this can not be_.Egypt’s entire

motive or even-the most important

one. » .
Egypt's motive for going to wa

was to "prepare herself for peace.

What -seems at first a paradox is

I really quite simple. Let us digress.‘

. Last year's Nixoii-Brezhnev sum-
mit produced. among other things.
an informal agreenient for sincere
cooperation_to find a solution in the
Middle East. Both the U.S. and the
Soviet Union I are satisfied with

_their balance of power in the

Middle East and each wished to
avoid direct confrontation there.
At the same titiie.‘l-lenry Kissinger

’ settled accounts in Vietnam, and
turned his attention and energy to’

the Middle East. ' - .
In short. the doo_r was beginnin
to open on negotiations between
Israel. backed by the U.S.. and the
Arab nations. backed-' by

-U.S.S.R.

 However the Arabs had a big
problem. They had lost alot of
territory in 1967 and thus alot of
bargaining power rested ‘in Israeli
hands. Because of Egypt's role as
leader of the Arab world, Israel’s‘
occupation of Sinai was ’ most
damaging of all and itpromised to

yield major Egyptian concessions

when negotiation time arrived.

’ Thus Egypt's strategy was as-
follows: Launch a powerful
surprise attack on the east bank of
the Suez Canal. establish a military

force of respectable size there. and ‘

then obtain a quick standstill cease
fire to preserve the new gains.

the .

The new Egyptian presence Sinai
would serve to greatly offset
Israel's political advantage so when
negotiations‘began. Egypt would
not have to enteigon her knees.

This explanation of Egyptian
strategy I is buttressed by the

behavior of the Soviet Union during ‘

the war. The Soviets knew of
specificEgyptian warplans 3 days
in advance. rThey immediately

‘ withdrew" all Soviet personnel and

prepared for an arms airlift__.to
Egypt and Syria.

i

Moscow then waited for the war
to begin and started a massive
airlift of war materials. Egypt
successfully’ captured a good
portion of the east bank and only
then did Soviet Premier Alexei
Kosygin suddenly flyto, Cairo on a
peace mission and only then did the
Kremlin call for Kissinger to
arrange a standstill cease ﬁre.

comparatively small meeting room
arranged with rows of chairs in

Opera Opening: All That Glitters...

BY MAX EVERETT

Last week was Grand Opera
Week in the City of Pittsburgh by
special proclamation of Pete
Flaherty, but it is doubtful that
anyone even knew about it except
the Mayor himself and those
people who read it in the program
for The Barber of Seville this
weekend.

Grand Opera is obviously not one
of the things that gets a lot of
people very excited, but why then
are the performances here invari-
ably sold out, especially with the
exorbitant prices which seem
necessary to produce such extrava-
ganzas? I am not prepared to
answer this question, but if we look
at the audience for a moment we
may get at least a clue. It sparkles
with the glitter of high society in
everything from its dress to its
conversation to its returning late
from intermission (both of them.)
Perhaps attending the opera is
simply one of the prerequisites for

being a part of the upper crust;
when the wife of Dr. Wesley W.
Posvar sings in her own town it
certainly seems to be.

Gioachino Rossini, who wrote the
music for The Barber of Seville in
less than three weeks, may have
had a very similar audience to
contend with in 1816, when the
work was first performed. First of
all, the opera is grand only in the
scale of its musical demands on the
singers; the plot could have been
more successfully made into a
Marx Brothers movie, and the
characters have about as much
depth as Batman. Technically, this
makes Barber an “opera buffa” or
comic opera. Rossini was notorious
during his lifetime for taking his
pleasures more seriously than his
work -- dashing off operas at
breakneck speed and even abruptly
retiring from the opera business at
the age of 37, but the people loved
his music and undoubtedly got a lot
more out of the lyrics than we do
because they could speak Italian.

DON VAN CHERRY

If you judge by audience
reaction, the Pittsburgh production
ofBarber was a smashing success:
the principals were called back for
numerous curtain calls after each
act, but then that happens at every
performance. so one never knows
whether anyone means it or not any
more than he knows why they all
came in the first place.

In the end, you just have to fall
back on your own personal reasons
for going and you can’t let the
audience or anyone else (including
the critics) tell you whether to like
it or not. In my case, I go to hear
the music, and Pittsburgh's Barber
was neither as touching, moving,
exciting, funny, nor even as
entertaining to me as it was to
everyone else at Heinz Hall on
Saturday night.

Block Dialect

(Continued from Page I)

Whutley said she would rather
have black children taught to read
and write in standard English since
that is being taught, “than to have
75% of the students coming out
without learning how to speak,
read and write.” She questioned
Sternglass’s concept of writing
dealing only with grammar instead
of the expression of concepts and
ideas.

After disagreeing with Holland’s
proposal that dialectic language
remain unchanged, Whutley said
teachers create unnecessary inter-
ference each time they correct
dialectic pronunciation.

When questioned, Whutley clari-
fied her position, saying training to
accept dialects -must begin by
educating student teachers before
they leave college. Until that time
she concluded, blacks must abide
by what the dominate culture
demands “because racism is a
reality.”

The fourth‘ lecture of the series
will be November 7, dealing with
blacks in white institutions.

‘There is no religion’

(Continued from Page 5)
not a religion. “No favors are
bestowed upon anyone because of
their beliefs, nor is anyone
penalized because of their beliefs.

‘ I never asked anyone do you eat

meat, do you do this, or do you do
that...I think the best thing we can
do where-- religion is concerned is
not to have one, but to have a
religious mind...The religions _are
going to have to step down,
because they haven’t done much
except to relieve fear...There is no
religion higher than the truth.”
Some’ of the weekly events held by
the Society include classes in
astrology, healing, meditation and
theosophy, all of which are ‘open; to
the public. When I asked Bevrely
about the healing class, she said,
“We don’t do it ourselves-we call
upon the angelic beings._..Mem-
bers must abstain. from meat,

drugs, alcohol and tobacco for six
months before they can attend a
healing session.” '
Bevrely couldn’t refrain from
expressing her total joy in being a
part of the Theosophical Society.
“If there is such a thing as magic,
it is built here...To me .it is terribly
important that this place exists,
and it does in spite of everything-
[she laughs]-even all our hot-
ching'...I’m an artist. I love the
best in art and theatre, but I’ve
never found anything to equal
this.” As I was preparing to leave,
Bevrely kindly presented me with a
paperback version of a book by J.

Krishnamurti entitled Think On

These Things. , ‘

.“I’ve fallen in love with this book
and I hope you will too... Feel free
to browse before you leave, and
please come again.”

I assured her that I would.

“Our win over Boston College has
given the team a lot’ of conﬁ-
dence." head coach Johnny Majors
addressed’ the weekly football
luncheon crowd at the Holiday Inn
in Greentree. “the players can
enjoy Saturdays more now because
they know what they are working
for." ' V

Majors called the victory the
“best defensive game overall" and

one at home.
“There's one change in

But the fact that the Panthers
have notched all three. of their
victories on the road stood
foremost in his mind and Majors
quickly told the audience.; “There's,

assignments with success. .

= praise from him.

  Talk Isl“
V. pp pcheap s p p

_  ., BY VINCE DINARDO
Being i'n frequent contactjwith Johnny Majors is coming to the

 

» ‘realization that he is one smooth cat. I mean he's smoother than a cold

Michelob making its way down a parched throat. V-

Oh yeah.’he dresses extremely well and his"di«mples undoubtedly aid ’

him in his public appearenceshbut the single most important thing
Majors does is talk. He talks a heck of" a good game--a winning
ballgame. ' V \ "

Alas. when ‘you. put this together with his uncanny knowledge of

football. you have a Pitt team that's 3-2-1 coming off a 1-10 card last
year. . _ l _ j
i There are three reasons the-Panthers are beating the timetable back

to respectability and dominance. They are: 1) Johnny Majorsand his

_ coachingstaff, 2) Johnny Majors and his coaching staff, and 3) Johnny
Majors and his coaching staff. _, ’
' A convincing argument_ couldbe made. here for Tony Dorsett as

another reason. but Dorsett wouldn't be here unless Majors had his

vocal chords» tuned; ‘Dorsett.-has said-as much.

‘fl like the way he talks," ‘Dorsett said after signing his letter of_

intent. Tony "didn't mean the southern drawl, but rather the convincing
content about a winning team at Pitt. Really, .when considering that

‘ the whole coaching staff convinced 72 freshmen athletesand six Junior

College transfers to come to a program that used to; use mud for
make-up. talk is no longer cheap. by a longshot. _
But, what does this man from Tennessee say? Well, he pumpshis

‘ , program, pushes Pennsylvania, glamorizes Pittsburgh, and praises his

.0

 
 

players by usinga standard sentence and applying i_t to the thing he's I

pre_sently talking about. .

Here are some examples: On the day he "was hired he said,

I “Pittsburgh is a beautiful city, as beautiful a city as'I've been in'';'after ,

the bus ride to West Virginia hesaid. “with all the colorful foilage.
Pennsylvania is a beautiful state this time of year. It's as beautiful as
I've seen anywhere"; at Johﬁstown he said. “I've never asked so much
from" ‘a coaching.staff”and abunch of-players in one week and I have
never. in 'my coaching lifef received as much..in return." V
About Dorsettfs 265 rushing yards at Northwestern he said, “that's
the best’ individual performance I've ever seen.by a young man and
-probably one of the best ever invcollege football history"; about the

West Vir iniat ame he said. “it was as fine a team effort I've seen as a ‘
8 8 e . .

coach"; and. about Dave Wanndstedt he says, --you guessed it-- “he's
as improved as player as I've been around." ‘ ' . -
Amazingly-enough, Majors seems quite sincere everytime he uses
his favorite sentence. . _ ’ ’ ‘ , ' .
The biggest on the field change is again attributed to Majors and his
staff. The Cats are having a blast practicing during the week. They do
‘all kinds of groovy things to keep loose. The coaches could very well be
the frat boys next door. . I _ " '
' In an effort to have fun. the whole defense was armed with fly
swatters to swat ‘Buggs’ in preparing for the Mountaineers and all the
coaches wore Tulane T-shirts to practice before that game (the coaches
were attacked andithe shirts ripped off). .
Then there are other ‘little things’. John uses a computer in forming

his game plan. \He holds conferences'with the student body every.
Monday. He sends his coaches -to talk to fraternities. If there is an -

edge ‘to help his program, he will digit out.

To be sure. Johnny Majors does "‘-whatever it takes" andmore. and
because of it. he is as refreshing a personality to hit this University as‘
anyone hastseenin a long time. ' ' I . ‘ - ‘ 7

mused. “We might put our boys ‘

Quitters team 3-1. The entire game
was a defensive struggle with the
outcome decided in the final
minute of the game.

‘The Table drew first blood with

pass from Sheatz to Schellbocker
gavethe Table a 1-0 lead looking on
the way to the finals.
Quitters quickly showed they had
come to play knotting the score
with a long outside kick.

The remainder of the first half
was a showing of good solid
defense on the part of both teams
although the Quitters did have a
chance but couldn't put. it through.

Beginning the second half, the
