Hundreds endure weather to pay tribu

By Jeff Tatusko

Perspective Editor

While government dignitaries
from across the state and nation
sat inside Heinz Memorial Chapel,
hundreds braved ferocious winds
yesterday to pay ﬁnal respects to
Sen. H. John Heinz at his funeral.

Approximately 500 people sat
under a tent and listened to the
private service, which was
broadcast through a sound
system. The up to 40-mile-pep

hour wind nearly blew the tent
over, forcing university staff
workers to manually support the
tent posts. Only those with an
invitation from the Heinz family
were permitted inside the chapel.

Inside, Heinz was remembered
by friends and family as a hard,
worker who cared for his family
as well as his work. Heinz’s son
Andre called his father “a man of
action who worked hard at all
times. , ..

“I could go on and on for a long
time,” he said, “but words aren't
enough to describe him.”

H. John Heinz IV said of his
father, “A ﬂower can’t proclaim
its beauty until it dies.”

Dr. Theodore E. Stebbins, a
close friend of the Heinz family,
said that Heinz would have been
proud of the people who attended
the service.

“He would have been so proud
of his three sons and proud of
everybody, _ both inside and
outside, who came here to honor
liirn,” Stebbins said.

“His energy, cheerfulness and
love of life were contagious,” he
said. “He would never accept
inevitable defeat.

“All men are dust, but some are
dust of gold.”

Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Col.)
said that Heinz possessed the
three essentials of politics. “He
worked hard; he was stubborn,
and he had the right priorities 
He was always fighting for fairer
treatment, for the people of
Pennsylvania. He loved the
people.

“He had
innocence,” Wirth said. “He

honestly believed he could make _,

the world better. He was
wonderfully naive. It gave him
the freedom to dare.” Wirth quoted
a security guard who, when he

learned of Heinz’s death, said,

an endearing

“We’ve lost a gre-at leader.”

Wirth also said that Heinz was

a concerned environmentalist.
“He was outraged that fires were
destroying areas the size of
Pennsylvania in the Amazonian
‘ rain -forest,” he said. “He always
thought we should use our
abilities to take care of the earth.”
Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.), an
ordained Episcopalian minister,
co-conducted the service.
“[Heinz] left the world of security
and entered a world of risk,” he
said. “He made a gift to the
people he wanted to serve. That

gift turned out to be his life.

“Over the years, many people
have died in office," Danforth
said. “John Heinz died performing

I the duties of his office. There is a

difference.”

Vice President Dan Quayle
attended the service, although
he entered through a side door
of the chapel, unlike most others
who entered through the main
door. Other members of Congress
in attendance included Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, Sen.
Sam Nunn (D—Ga.) and Sen. Paul

- Simon (D-Ill.).,G ov. Robert Casey

also attendedjthe funeral.

Though John Dennis
O’Connor has hada substantial
number of offers to apply for
university presidencies, the Pitt
presidency is the only position
he has chosen to pursue.

The reason, O’Connor told a
meeting of the Student Affairs
Advisory Council yesterday, lies

J in the qualities Pitt possesses
right now.

“An institution has to have
several characteristics for me to
be interested in it. It has to have
a remarkably interesting faculty
who are doing exciting things,
so you can walk down the halls
and periodically hear, ‘Eureka!
1 am the first human being that
ever discovered that or had this
insight,”’ O’Connor said;
“Secondly you have to have a
faculty that is excited about the
undergraduate mission of an
institution.”

O’Connor, the vice chancellor
for academic affairs at the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, is the fourth Pitt
presidential candidate to visit
campus and meet with campus
leaders.

The main issues at these
meetings have included
graduate and undergraduate
instructional programs, research
and its effects on instruction,
minority recruitment and
athletics, according V to

 

Summerlea Kashar/The Pitt News
John Dennis O'Connor

O’Connor.

O’Connor addressed the issue
of the priorities of graduate
and undergraduate education
and research at the SAAC
meeting.

“Research is to teaching as sin
is to confession,” O’Connor said.
“If you don’t do one, you have

absolutely nothing to say in the _

other.”

The University of Pittsburgh
has prided itself for a long time
as being a “producer institution,
if you will couch it in economic
terms,” O’Connor said.

“Pitt has been the source of
much of what is taught at other
institutions across the United
States. The University‘ of
Pittsburgh is the source of a
large number of concepts,
products, techniques and
insights that people at places
like Reed and Oberlin andother
institutions use in their
classrooms,” O’Connor said.
“That has come about solely
because of the curiosity factor
at an institution like Pitt. ‘

Students meet presidential candidate

“Call it research, but also call
it an environment at which
individuals have been
encouraged to push back that
level of understanding even
further.”

O’Connor stressed the

‘importance of graduate

education.

“Graduate education is the
training of individuals in how
to ask appropriate questions
and how to deal with
developing approaches toward
answering those questions. The
graduate students that you have
hereat Pitt will become the
next generation of faculty, and
it is incumbentupon institutions
like Pitt to train them and train
them well,” he said. “Research
and graduate education go hand
in hand; you cannot do one
without the other. I don’t think
that you can have the kind of
really electrifying, critically
interesting kind of instruction

without being in a producer ’
kind of research environment. ,

And I think it finds its way into
the undergraduate curriculum.”
Graduate StudentAssociation
President Barbara Salthouse
asked O’Connor about how he
thinks the quality of teaching in
graduate school can be
improved.
O’Connor pointed to the
methods in use at UNC.

Federal government

plans university audit

By Jim Tezak

News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh is
among nine schools whose
research programs are scheduled
to be audited by federal officials,

according to university officials.

Federal officials have no
indication that any of the schools
involved have committed any
wrongdoings, but they are
looking into other programs
following Stanford University’s
billing’ of luxury costs to the
government, according to a report
in yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

“The audits are welcome and
will help ensure that major
research institutions are

‘ exercising appropriate controls
on expenditures charged to
federal research accounts,” Pitt
President Wesley Posvar said in a
prepared statement. _

Michael Crouch, director of
Pitt’s Office of Research, said that
the audit will be run through the
Comptroller’s Office. He did not
know how extensive the audit
would be.

“Our office is in a supporting
role, a coordinating role,” he said. '
Crouch also said that Pitt was

Local professionals  
address law students

Staff Writer

“Prospects in Law: AView from
the Bar” was the title of the
seminar presented by the Pre-
Law Society and Pi Sigma Alpha,
the political science honorary,
Wednesday in the Assembly
Room of the William Pitt Union.

“The idea was actually Ken
Gormley’s,”- says Bill Permar,
president of the Pre—Law Society.
“There was a- similar program
here when he went to Pitt, so he
thought it would be beneficial to
start it up again. He asked John

Jackson and I if we would help,
and it all came together.” .

John Jackson, president of the
political science honorary,
worked with Permar to organize
and publicize the event. The
seminar, which consisted of talks
from nine professionals in the
ﬁeld of law, addressed such issues
as getting into law school and
what types of problems one might
face after graduation.

Professor Ken Gormley began _

with some opening remarks on

“My commitment to affirmative
action I think has been both
strong and established since my
very early days at UCLA,”
O’Connor said. “I have come to
the conclusion, and I think it is a
correct conclusion, that
affirmative-action programs have
to be couched in the long—term
solutions."

A program at UNC is working“

toward a long—term solution. The
program allows UNC to hire 10
p'ost-doctoral 9 minorities for a
period of two years. The program
gives those students a chance to
concentrate on turning their Ph.D.
dissertations into books so that
they are qualified to move into

the various ways that law can

pursuing a career in law.

“It has been enormously
successful,” O’Connor said. “Out
of 40 people who have been

When UNC noticed that few
minorities in that program were

approach. UNC now has

CHMR trains Workers for hazardous Waste disposal

By Margaret Swisher
Staﬂ“ Writer

( This is the last of a ﬁve-part
series about the Pitt Trust.)

When the Persian Gulf oil crisis
occurred, the president of the
University of Pittsburgh’s Center
for Hazard Materials Research
spent the weekend on television
answering questions about what
could happen to the environment.

“We are recognized locally. The
media calls us when there are
environmental problems,” said
Edgar Berkey, president of CHMR.
“We think about the danger and

what can be done about it."
CHMR is one of the five entities
in the University of Pittsburgh
Trust. Its purpose is to respond to
the growing problems associated
with the use and disposal of
hazardous materials and wastes.
CHMR is located in Harmarville
at the University of Pittsburgh
Applied Research Corporation.
Richard Jewell, former
executive vice president of the
trust, said CHMR responds to
these problems in many ways.
“CHMR has a training division
where they [train] workers as
required by the various public

laws. [Workers] are shown how
to perform in hazardous waste
catastrophes.”

The Short—Life Railroad, one of
the few simulated hazardous-
waste facilities in the United States,
is located at CHMR. “The railroad
company is about 100 yards long,
and on it are big railroad tank
cars, all ﬂipped over,” saidjewell.
“They take people down there in
space suits with their hands-on
training, and they simulate
hazardous-waste transparencies.”

Also located at the “railroad” is
a simulated 'hazardous—waste
dump and toppled—over tractor

trailers filled with rusting drums
of “hazardous waste." “We have
people coming here from all over
the country to take our courses,”
said Berkey.

CHMR also has a 24-hour toll-
free hazardous materials hotline
which provides confidential
advice concerning hazardous
materials and solid-waste
questions. People can call and
ask questions on hazardous
materials and will be sent fact
sheets on their specific problem.
“We are able to get good, practical
advice about rules and regulations.
CHMR can put people in touch

with somebody else [for] their
particular problem,” said Jewell.
“The hotline has proved to be the

most significant and well- r

received portion l...l of CHMR.”
‘When the Ashland oil tank
collapsed injanuary 1988, CHMR
was asked by the Ashland Oil
Company to do a one-year study
on the accident. “They came, and
[Ashland Oil Company] called a
press" conference and said, ‘We
are going to pay CHMR to do the
systems analysis of what the
destruction is. We are not going
to even know what they’re doing.’
That is exactly what they did.”

Audit

chosen because it is a “representative
institution.” Officials from the Comptroller's
Office would not comment on the audit.
Inspector General Richard Kusserow
said the schools were selected because

they are among the largest recipients of .
— federal grants. Some had already been

scheduled for audits, and some were
chosen because they charge above-average
overhead rates. Investigators also wanted

a geographical cross section, he said.
Neither Crouch nor Tim Ziaukas, director
of communications, could confirm how
much money Pitt receives in federal grants.
Other schools named to be audited are

N.J.; the University of Chicago; Duke
University in Durham, N.C.; Emory
University in Atlanta, Ga.; the University
of Michigan; the University, of Texas

University of Southern California.

“The scope of the university’s research
effort is underscored here. We’re in the
company of [schools such as] Chicago,
Rutgers and Southern California. It will be
a mutually beneficial exchange of
information,” Ziaukas said.

The audits will focus on indirect costs of
research that a school charges to the
federal government for things such as

utilities, library and administrative services
and building depreciation.

In the Stanford case, General Accounting
Office auditors said that they discovered
the university had charged the government
for expenses related to a $1,200 antique

commode, a $10,000 set of donated.

silverware and a university-owned
shopping center. University officials later
withdrew nearly $700,000 in charges for
most of the questionable expenses. I

Burning tbe ozone away...

Anybody who ever thought that three atoms of oxygen

would never deeply matter in their lives is wrong. Dead
wrong.
' According to recent studies, the ozone layer, which is
made up of three atoms. of oxygen per. molecule, is
vanishing at an alarming rate, over twice what had been
expected. In other words, the earth is absorbing more
ultraviolet rays through its atmosphere, and that’s bad
news for every living thing on this planet.

Right now, the major culprits behind this depletion are
chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCS). These tiny molecules, which
come from such luxuries as air conditioners and
refrigerators, rise into the atmosphere and detract from
the ozone’s capabilities. I

As a result, more people willultimately contract and die
from skin cancer. Approximately 8,000 people die each
year with the current status of this layer. This number
could skyrocket in coming years, possibly reaching 200,000
in the next 50 years.

The United States and other developed countries, such
as Germany, England and Japan, contribute about 70
percent of the CFCs to the atmosphere. This production
must be slowed to give the ozone some time to rest.

The situation, however, is not hopeless — yet. The
Clean Air Act of 1990 states that the production of these
CFCs must be cut drastically over the next decade.
Corporations must cut back their distribution of CFCs by
20 percent by 1993 and by as much as 50 percent by 1998.

Meanwhile, the citizens of this planet can also make a
difference. We must begin to cut back on both refrigeration
and air conditioning in our homes. By doing this, we can
begin to give the ozone a chance to rebuild. Although it
seems a sacriﬁce now, in the future it will not seem as such.

This is not the only solution. Companies are now
attempting to develop hydro-CFCs in an attempt to replace
the more harmful CFCs. HCFCs ‘do not kill off the ozone
nearly as quickly, and are an early substitute for CFCs. The
Clean Air Act, however, says that HCFCS ‘must also be
completely disbanded by 2030.

This deadline must be met. More research must be made
into discovering new alternatives for both HCFCs and
CFCs. Otherwise, skin cancer, instead of the minor problem
it presents now, could become the-epidemic of the next
century.

Earlier this week, many people on this campus took a
break to lay in the sun, getting an early start on their
summer tans. And already, many people have gotten their
first taste of a summer sunburn. Our ability to “sunbathe”
however, may soon be severely curtailed, unless CFCs can
be eliminated and alternatives can be found.

License dogs and not guns?

‘One could conceivably infer"
that Mr. [Tom] Lester has never
had a family member killed or
incapacitated due to damage
inﬂicted by ﬁrearms (as Sarah
Brady has). Also, it appears
unlikely that Mr. Lester lives in a
section of town where drive-by
shootings, drug-dealer wars and
the massacre of young men due
to rampant gun proliferation are
everyday experiences. This is too
bad, as perhaps Mr. Lester would
not be so insensitive as to fire off
editorials without carefully
considering the -folks at the
business end of a cheap~Saturday-
night special.

I am sure that the majority of
people who support gun-control
legislation are not “uptight
hoplaphobes." Almost as certain
as I am that people who shoot for
sport are not homicidal,
pathological adolescents who
view the gun as an extension of
their genitalia. So let's quit with
the stereotypes. .

Why is it that in America, ‘one
must register their dog, get a
marriage license and take driving
lessons? All these are common
events done with a minimum
sacrifice of personal freedom for
the common good. But any 01’
psycho can buy a shoot—’em—up
special with little to no hindrance.
Personal liberty or mounds of
bodies stacked thanks to the NRA?

Where does the right to bear
arms end? Apache helicopters? l...l
While your points regarding the
constitutional legality of the Brady
Bill might hold some water,
references to assault weapons as
being only “dangerous looking”
are merely irresponsible.

Also [if] one is going to use the
Second Amendment in such
arguments, please do so in the
context that it was written 200-
odd years ago. Before Uzis and

So the only fault of semi-»

automatic weapons is that they
look dangerous? That, and the
fact that they create holes in a
person's body that tend to bleed
a lot. As for the AK-47, I am glad
you admit it is infamous. The
school children that Patrick Purdy
harvested with one in Stockton,
Calif. are testament to that point.
A background check worked

No right to gun ownership

I am writing in response to the
article “Brady Bill contradicts 2nd
Amendment,” in the April 1
edition of The Pitt News. It
disturbs me to know that out
there are people our there who
would make restrictions and pass
which violate - our
constitutional rights. Even more
distressing, however, are those
who pretend to defend our
constitutional rights when they

‘clearly have never read the

Constitution. The Second
Amendment in no way guarantees
a person's unrestricted right to
gun ownership, and advocating
such a policy would be short-
sighted, to say the least.  .
Finally, with all of the gun-
related accidents and crimes in
this country, if you “can see no
danger in having a semi-automatic"
riﬂe," I suggest you open your
eyes.

Fasting not all bad

Jacinta Dvorak’s letter (April 1)
was a reply to a previous [column]
by Eric Hoch on dying with
dignity. Unfortunately, I did not
read Mr. Hoch’s [column], but I
wish to comment on some of the
statements in Ms. Dvorak’s~letter.
More than a century ago, Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes made the
suggestion that hopelessly

incurable patients should be put
to death to put them out of their
misery. Hygienic doctors objected
vigorously to this suggestion,
claiming that it was an attempt to
cheat them of patients. The
hygienists, hydropaths,
homeopaths and others got most
of their business from patients
who had been pronounced
hopelessly incurable by the
regular medical practitioners.

Ms. Dvorak made the statement
that a person “can live up to 12
days without food while their
tongue cracks and their skin hangs
on their body.” I wonder where
she got this information. I once
fasted for 21 days, taking no food
during this period. I know many
other people who have been on
rational fastsl of longer than 12
days, and who have recovered
health due to this procedure.
There_is no need to deny. water
during a rational fast,iso there is
no danger of dehydration. The
tongue coats heavily —-but does
not “crack.” The skin does not
“hang on the body” but comes
down together with the body as
fat is consumed, making fasting a
beauty-enhancing way of
reducing.

Fasting is not starvation.
Starvation only begins when the
body's reserves have been
completely used up. Until this
time is reached, one may safely
go without food. Stuffing and
foroe-feeding on “ plenty of good
nourishing food" when there is
little digestive power is usually a
source of weakness rather than
of strength. When death is
inevitable, withholding food
means less suffering and a clearer
mind. l...l

I do not advise anyone to fast
unless she or he understands it
thoroughly by reading the
literature on fasting. If possible,
fasting should be done at an
institution under the supervision
of someone with much
experience in conducting and
breaking fasts.

The 1990-91 Lady Panthers’
tennis team is in a position to
ﬁnish with a .500 record, if it
wins the final two matches of the

season. The biggest reason for

this accomplishment has been
the return of Erika Devins.
Devins, a sophomore from
Pottstown, Pa., was coming off a
stellar freshman season in which
she played No. 1 singles for Pitt
and teamed with Julie LoPrinzi
to form the Panthers’ top doubles
combination last year. But late in
August she suffered a- stress
fracture of the femur that
sidelined her for four months.‘
“Any time you lose your No. 1

player, it really affects the depth I

of your team because all of the
other players have to move up
into positions they wouldn’t
normally be playing in,” said
Coach George Dieffenbach.
Devins returned inJanuary and
has gradually eased back into
her game. “The injury was a very

frustrating experience,” she said.
“It was like starting all over again.”
Devins’ quickness and stamina
have yet to return to 100 percent,
and one of her "goals for next
season is to be in better shape.
Dieffenbach described Devins
as a very consistent player who
has a strong forehand and a strong
two—handed backhand. Her
consistency was something that
the team missed badly during her
injury. Devins said that
groundstrokes are a major
strength of her game, but she
sees room for improvement.

“For me to move to the next-

level, I have to be more aggressive
and work on my net game," she
said. “I’m striving to get back to
the level I was at before my
injury.”

Dieffenbach praised Devins’
excellent work habits and added

~.

that she is a very coachable
player. “She is very serious about
her game,” he said.

“I am very coachable. I didn't
start playing tennis until I was
12, which is relatively late, so I
try to respect my coaches’
opinions and listen to their
suggestions,” Devins said.

Her idols in the early days
were Chris Evert and John
McEnroe. Devins played No. 1
singles all four years at Owen J.

Roberts High School and went V

undefeated in her senior year.
She was also ranked No. 7 in
Middle States in the 16-and-under
age bracket.

She chose Pitt for one reason:
academics. ‘ .

“Coach Dieffenbach stresses
academics first and tennis
second, and that’s a big difference
from most schools, ” Devins said.
“Academics are definitely
important. Ninety—nine percent
of college athletes aren't going
anywhere, so school should
definitely come first.”

As a freshman at Pitt, Devins

and LoPrinzi finished with a
doubles record of 12-9. This
season her singles mark stands at
7-3. Devins said that the level of
competition in college is much
tougher,but she enjoys it. '

Dieffenbach credits Devins.

with making Pitt’s quest for .500
possible. “I don’t think we would
be in a position to do that if Erika
hadn’t been healthy. She's a big
reason why we’re in this position.’

Eight lacrosse teams from four different
states swaggered through town last weekend
and manned the lacrosse battleﬁelds, each
expecting to mercilessly outgun any opponent
that stood between it and victory. ,

In the end, however, it was only the
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club that could gun
down all others. PLC went 5-0 and galloped
home as the winners of the first annual
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout .

PLC defeated Division III power Buffalo
State University in the tournament's

Charlie Gross gave PLC a .1-O lead when he
pumped in a goal early in the first period.
PLC scored two more goals and were leading
3-0 before Buffalo State could retaliate with
a goal of its own. Although Buffalo State
University trimmed the PLC lead to 5-3 at
halftime and 6-5 late in the fourth period, it
could get no closer before time elapsed. .

Gary Neft, Frank Beddings and Gross all
scored two goals apiece for PLC, while John

Macblane and Carl Foriero pumped in two

each for Buffalo State. '
Macblane won the toumey’s offensive

award, while PLC’s Graham Standish won
defensive MVP honors. Peter Vonderlieth of
Carnegie Mellon -was awarded best goalie of
the tournament. ‘

According to Vonderlieth, the tournament
chairperson and CM goalie, the weekend’s
events went smoothly, and another shootout
is probable next year.

losing its only game to runner-up Buffalo 
Pittrnidﬁelder Lee Stember and defenseman
Dan Haggerty were named to the All-
Tournament team.

White Sox loo/e to end Athletics’ reign in West

Pitt placed "fourth in the _

The American League West
has been dominated for the last
three seasons by the Oakland
Athletics, but this season should

— be different.

The rest of this division is
finally catching up, and those
who are looking for Tony
LaRussa’s juggernauts to smash
and bash their way to another

3 title could be in for a surprise.
From top to bottom, this division
is now the most balanced in
baseball.

The Chicago White Sox are
one of the youngest teams in the
majors, yet they won 94 games
last season. Complete with ﬂashy
new uniforms and a brand-new
ball park, the Sox are brimming
with enthusiasm and are primed
for a title’ run.

The Sox went out and got the
two ingredients they needed:
power a_nd leadership. Those
came in the same package when
Ivan Calderon was traded for
Tim “Rock” Raines. Hulking Frank
Thomas, all 6-foot-S-inches and
240 pounds of him, should
become one of the game's top
power hitters this season. Another

- upcoming star is Sammy Sosa
(15 HRS; 70 RBI; 32 SBS), the

Rob
Pugliese

Sox's versatile right fielder.

The ageless wonder, catcher
Carlton Fisk, is the glue for this
team, and having Raines around
will do wonders. Yes, the Sox are
young, but last year they
experienoeda tough pennant race
which has made them even

hungrier. Then again, I guess it’s ‘

an easy thing to believe when
you own every close ball game.
Chicago has the best closer in the
game. Can you say, "57 saves”?
Bobby Thigpen sure can.

The only question will be
leading up to “Thigpen time."
Jack McDowell (14-9, 3.82), Greg
Hibbard (14-9, 3.16) and 21-year-
old phenom Alex Fernandez
compose a very" formidable trio.
Fernandez went 5-5 in a two-
month stint» fresh from college
ball and holds the key for title
hopes.

Tony LaRussa is the best
manager in baseball, and he has
the task of keeping his Oakland
Athletics focused for another

championship run. American,

League MVP Rickey Henderson
has been causing problems by
doing his best Barry Bonds
impression, whining about not
getting enough glory and money.

Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire combined for 76 home
runs and 208 RBIs and should
terrorize the league again. But
the real key is whether Canseco’s
back will hold up for a full season.
The once solid inﬁeld suddenly
looks shaky with third baseman
Carney Lansford out for the
season.

Dave Stewart and his four
consecutive 20-win campaigns
should ﬁnally merit a, Cy Young
award this year. ‘Combine him
with last year's Cy Young winner,
Bob Welch, Mike Moore and 21-
year—old Texas phenom Kurt
Dressendorfer, and the A's ‘have
another killer rotation.

Who helped themselves more
than any other team‘ in this
division? The California
Angels. Dave Parker will turn 40
in June, but “The Cobra" is still
hitting. Last year he produced 21
homers and 92 RBIs to
complement his .292 average.

A healthy Wally Joyner and

leadoff man Luis Polonia (.336
last year) will provide plenty of
offense. New center ﬁelderJuhior
Felix will open some eyes now
that he has left the shadows of
Toronto's star-laden lineup.

A The major strength of the
Angels is theirstarting rotation._
Chuck Finley (18-9,‘ 2.40, 177 Ks)

-is the best lefthander inthe
, American League and will once

again excite the Anaheiin faithful.
Mark Langston will rebound from,
last year's 10-17 disaster with a
vengeance.

The Texas Rangers are the

unknown factor in the West. This _

club could win it all, but it could
also finish at .500.

The Rangers’ heart of Julio A

Franco, Ruben Sierra, Rafael
Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez can
wreak as much havoc as anybody
in the league. Sierra’s production
dropped off slightly, but he still
knocked in 96 runs and will be
playing to impress the arbitrators.
Gonzalez is just 21, but there is
immense pressure on him to put
up big numbers immediately.
In a division stacked with solid V
rotations, here is another one.
Begin with a man almost as big as

Just when you thought
wrestling had ended for the year,

this weekend marks a new

beginning. Wrestlers from 40

— . states across the nation will roll

into town to compete in the
second annual National High
Schoolwrestling Championships.

The nation’s best high-school
wrestlers will compete during
morning, afternoon and evening
sessions April 13 and 14. The
event comes to the Pittsburgh

wE'RE Looxme

Palumbo Center at Duquesne
University, promising nothing but
nonstop action and excitement.
Every wrestler across the
country who is‘ currently in his
senior year of high school and
has been a state champion has
been invited to compete in this
event. Only state champions are
eligible to compete. The first eight
place-winners in each weight
class will be officially declared
High School All-Americans. This
event attracts every major college
wrestling coach across the country
and serves as a showcase for

 

recruiting.

“Since last year, the quality of
competition has grown even
stronger,” according to Robert
Ferraro, Bucknell wrestling coach
and founder of the event. Ferraro
added, “This quality should make
this year’s event even better than
last year."

until an age when most people
are already set in a career. “You
may have something in mind
now, but that’S going to change.
You don’t have to become a
lawyer if you go to law school. It
can prepare you for many other
fields."

Next was Robert Cindrich,
managing partner of Mansmann,
Cindrich and Titus, a Downtown

 

.law firm. He quickly dismissed

the idea that law is a career you
get into to make money. He feels
the people who get into it with
this idea are bound to be
disappointed.

Cindrich also addressed some
of the downfalls of a career as a
lawyer, citing that often lawyers
with good intentions get caught
up in red tape and paperwork.
Another problem he mentioned
is balancing time between a family
and a career.

Defending Your Life

By Dmitri Ragano
Showcase Editor

If Albert Brooks’ new comedy
Defending Your Life is any
indication, we’re in for a pretty
ﬂimsy afterlife. _

West Coast executive Daniel
Miller (Brooks) buys a new BMW
on his birthday then runs it smack
into a bus. Before you know it,
he's riding a tram full of old folks
into Judgement City, where the
dead go to have their lives
reviewed.

“Daniel is assigned an attorney,
Mr. Diamond (Rip Torn), who is
some kind of superior being who
uses 48 percent of his brain. (We
earthbound creatures only use 3

percent.) He goes on trial to see
whether he should return to earth
or not. Daniel has already had 20
lives, and it seems his big
stumbling block is fearfulness.

Using a video screen, the
prosecuting attorney (Lee Grant)
pinpoints many crucial moments
in Daniel’s life when he chickened
out.

The trial has nothing to do
with spirituality, greater wisdom
or anything more significant than
Daniel being a coward. This is
kind of problematic: Hitler was a
pretty gutsy guy; does that mean
he's more “advanced” than some
yuppie who can't get up the
nerve to ask for a raise? Clearly,
Brooks wanted to hone in on his

You guessed it: Shirley MacLaine.

Daniel meets a woman (Meryl

way for a romantic ending which

Spring jazz at Pitt

By Cheryl Neidlinger
stag’ Wﬁter

Tonight at 8:30, the Pitt Program
Council and the Pitt music
department will be presenting
their annual spring jazz concert,
featuring the University of
Pittsburgh Jazz Ensemble. Each
year, the Jazz Ensemble brings in
the biggest names in jazz for this
one—night performance. This year
saxophone great James Moody,
direct from his European tour,
will be performing.

Moody is known for his
associations with Dizzy Gillespie’s
big bands over the years, as well
as for his ’50s hit “Moody’s Mood
For Love.” The song brought
Moody widespread success and
recognition for his improvised
solo style.

“I-Ie's such a lyrical player,"

'says Pitt Professor andlJazz

Ensemble director Nathan Davis.
“The song ‘Moody’s Mood For

Love’ was just an improvised
solo. It was so lyrical and so
melodious, though, that Eddie
Jefferson wrote lyrics to it, and it
became a great hit. All of Moody’s
solos are like that. ’lhat’s the
mark of a good player: you can
make up words to go with his
solos." When he was not
performing with Gillespie, Moody
headed his own jazz combos and
was involved in saxophone
battles with players like Gene
Ammons and Sonny Stitt.
Although Moody is best known
for his own unique style on the
saxophone, he is also considered
to be one of the most original
jazz flutists of our time. Davis
expects Moody to perform on
both instruments, first with the
Pitt Jazz Ensemble, then with a
small group made up of some
Pittsburgh's finest jazz musicians.
In addition to performances by
Moody and the Jazz Ensemble,
there will be a special

|’r's still rook ond roll high school forihe Ramones 

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

The Ramones were the United
States’ answer to the Sex Pistols.
They were at the forefront of the
punk revolution in America. For
over two decades, the Ramones
have weathered their abusive rock
‘n’ roll lifestyle. The alcohol, drugs,
ﬁghts and constant touring seem
not to have affected them in the
least. In fact, with the virtual
demise of punk rock in the States,
it seems that the Ramones have
outlasted punk itself.

Twelve riveting albums since
their beginning, the Ramones are
going strong. They still have the
same black leather jackets, pasty
white skin and long black hair,
not to mention their whimsical,
hardcore attitude. .

Johnny (guitar), Joey (vocals),
Marky (drums) and Dee Dee

- (bass) ruled the dying rock scene

on New York’s Lower East Side
along with other emerging stars,
such as Lou Reed and the New
York Dolls.

Following a rather stormy
relationship between Dee Dee
and the other band members,
Dee Dee left the band and
embarked on an uninspiring solo
project. The Ramones went on, in
search of a replacement.

The result was C] Ramone, who
took up with the band in
September 1989 under unusual
circumstances.

“At the time, I was home from
the Marine Corp — illegally, I
might add — and a friend of mine
called me up and told me the
[Ramones] were auditioning bass
players," CJ recounts. “They
auditioned between 75 and 80
bass players besides myself.
Eventually I got the gig.”

But being an instant rock ‘n’ roll
star didn't immediately dismiss
the fact that he was AWOL.

“I got in plenty of trouble,” he

says with a chuckle. “After I got
into the band, we had to cancel
the first tour because I got arrested
and put in the brig."

It's taken C] the last two years
to .. grow his hair out to a

“respectable” length. At 25, he’s a
generation gap behind the others,
but he fit right into the scheme of
things without suffering the shock
of such extreme lifestyle changes.
“They made the transition from
outlaw/criminal on the run, to
musician pretty easy,” he says.
Regardless of their criminal
history, the Ramones have fueled
the ire of several decades of
youngsters with their be-bop,
punky style. Driven by the stench
of the Bowery, the band churned
out such classics as “Sheena is a

Punk Rocker," “Psycho Therapy”
and “Beat on the Brat.”

On the outside, the Ramones
seem like a happy—go—lucky crew
with tons of fun songs, but
underlying their corny content is
often a more serious tone. Take
“Bonzo Goes to Bitburg,” which
criticizes Reagan’s trip to Bitburg
Cemetery. Censorship in
particular is a dark subject with
the Ramones.

“Joey especially stays pretty
active with the anti-censorship
thing,” says CJ. “They’re kind of

raping our constitutional rights.
Not enough people are aware of

it, and even if people are aware _ 

of it, they’re not sure how to go

about doing something about it .” ‘ I

“D—U-M-B. Everyone’s accusing
me," the Ramones sing, but don’t
be fooled; they’re more in touch

with reality than you might think. '

Pitt Theatre concludes its season
with James Gardner’s Heir
Transparent, a comical farce
translated and adapted by Freyda
Thomas from Jean-Francois
Regnard’s Le Legetaire Universal.
It is an entertaining and funny
play about the pursuit of wealth
in. the 18th-century Paris
household of a miser named
Geronte (played by David J.
Fielding). His devious servants,
the lovers Crispin and Lis_ette
(Thom Delventhal and Dawn
Alden), plot to gain their master’s
wealth through a variety of
schemes. ‘

The lovers’ plots grow to
include Geronte’s nephew Eraste
(Greg Longenhagen) and
Madame Argante (Bryn Bennett),

whose daughter Isabelle (Colleen
A. O’Connor) is in love with
Eraste but may have to marry the
tyrannical Geronte. Crispin and
Lisette utilize a number of
disguises in their quest to fool
Geronte and the notaries (Kevin
McDonald and Chris Lavancher)
in charge of his will.

Delventhal and Alden make a
charming, lusty couple, and
DeIventhal’s abilities as a physical
actor give credence to the
slapstick scenes of the piece. His
fencing scene with Longenhagen
is hysterical. Alden is great as the
saucy Lisette, who takes/perverse
delight in tormenting her master.
Longenhagen lost my attention at
times with his thankless role, but
that’s OK because he was so

— good in the fencing scene. Bryn

Bennett is well-cast as the
mercurial Madame Argante.

McDonald and Lavancher were
good for more than a few laughs
in their dual roles as the midget
notary-gendarmes. They
reminded my of a cross between
The Wizard of 025 munchkins
and the dancing dream man from
“Twin Peaks.” But where were
the reality police when the
notaries had a ﬂashlight in the
18th century?

Fielding has a field day as the
croaky Geronte who lies at the
heart of everyone’s machinations.
He is nothing less than superb,
playing a dirty old man obsessed
with his enema and not as
oblivious to the treachery
surrounding him as everyone
thinks.

However, my personal favorite
was O’Connor as the baby-doll-

caught my eye in what a lesser

incidental role. The exceptionally

No pity from Be|gium’s KMFD

By Tim Azinger _
Managing Editor

The Wax Trax label has always
been home to a slew of
semi-successful industrial/noise
bands. But since industrio-dance
has become all the rage,
Belgium’s post—industria1 dance
sensation KMFDM has become a
saving grace for the label.

The band’s moniker has been
touted to stand for “Kill Mother
Fucking Depeche Mode.” And
while this derogatory jingle may

have its merits, a more socially .

minded, reasonable and less
derogatory equivalent might be

 

“Keines Mitlied fiir die Mehrheit"
(No Pity for the Majority).

The band opened for Ministry
on its first U.S. tour. While
KMFDM _ may have been
overshadowed at the time by the
headliner’s reputation, it was the
band’s perfect opportunity for
exposure.

Co—founders Sasha Konietzko
and En 'Esch quickly found that
their apprehensions about the
U.S. music scene were minimal
compared to their newfound
success (and income).

Sporting an arrogant attitude
to match its heavy, hypno—dance
beats, KMFDM pounds out

thrilling, guttural music in the
vein of such industrial faves as
Ministry, Front 242 and Laibach.
The band’s sound is interesting, if
only because it mixes so many
musical styles into the final
product. Rap, disco, punk, rock,
pop —— it’s all there. KMFDM
samples and mixes with the best
of ‘em.

The band’s entire aura is rather
horriﬁc. As with most industrial
music, that sense of impending
doom is at a peak.

's iUsed Records

On top of the world (or at least Kinko's)

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News

If Jerry Weber (of Jerry's Fine
Used Records) started listening
today, he wouldn't get through

' his personal album collection until

around May 1994.

Jerry started his collection when
he was ﬁve and now owns about
20,000 records.

store," he said. “That’s the result
of owning a record store, too.”

The question that came to my
mind after interviewing Jerry is:
Why? What possesses a person to
own more albums that he could
reasonably listen to?

“I'm trying to build a
comprehensive library,” he said.
His plan is to specialize in unusual
tracks, which he would tape for

doing radio shows or just looking
for something bizarre.

“Say you wanted ‘Hey Jude’
played on a harpsichord. I'd like
to be able to punch the title up on
a computer and find the version
you're looking for,” he said. “It’s
just a dream of mine.”

Thirteen years ago Jerry was
laid off from his job as a postal
worker for a period of two months.

“I had a whole bunch of records
sitting around the house, so I got
a cheap storeroom and put up a
sign saying, ‘We buy records, ’” he

rm; Prrr N1-zws, ‘Thursday, April 11, 1991

On the day I interviewed Jerry,
Neil Young’s “Live Rust” was
playing in the background, and
Jerry wasn’t feeling up to par. He
had been home most of the week
with the ﬂu and had returned that
day to face the steady traffic of a
store full of customers — mostly
students.

“What can I get for these?” a
customer interrupted. Jerry
carefully inspected a handful of
Grateful Dead compact discs and
offered a $35 trade. The customer
accepted and set off to scan the
stacks.

There are between 150,000 to
200,000 albums in the store, and
all of them were either traded or
sold by customers.

“I don’t order anything,” Jerry
said. “That’s what’s unique about
my store -- no distributor.”

What does Jerry look for in the
CD3 he purchases? Initials.

He warns people with large CD
collections to “put your initials on

them in a hidden place.‘People

are stealing them,” he said. 7,, I

“I had three stolen,” another
customer said. She suspected her
roommate but had no evidence.
She was there that day to try to
replace the CD3.

Putting your initials on your
CDS is “a good thing to do,”
according to Jerry, “especially in
a university town” because he
can ask customers for ID once he
spots the initials. A

The striking thing aboutjerry is
his knowledge of music. Ask him

about an artist or a record, and

he’ll tell you right away whether

he has the album it in stoc ,":"

usually adding some of his own
knowledge of the album.

Jerry talks to a lot of his
customers about the albums they
buy, then he decides for himself
whether he "respects their
opinions. “I can also tell what’s
good by what sells,” he said.

Just one Pittsburgh band has
to make it, and the doors of
opportunity will open for the
pool of talent that ﬂoods the city.

Cat Ballou wants to be that
band.

It has been swimming among
struggling local talent for the
past two years. Now it’s ready
for bigger waters.

Starting out, it played every
major venue in the Pittsburgh
area except the Syria Mosque
and the Civic Arena, racking up
close to 50 or 60 shows, according
to keyboardist Casey Palovitch.
But it soon realized- the high cost
of playing in a city that seems to
lack support for new music.

needs some help. - '  ‘

For those of you who don’t
know this name yet, remember
it: Erik Hanson. He went 18-9
with a 3124 ERA and 21 1 strikeouts
last year and will anchor a young,
but solid rotation that will keep
the Mariners competitive for most
of the season. Mike Schooler did
save 30 games a year ago, but he
made so many appearances his
shoulder broke down in August._

So who’s gonna fill the shoes of
Bo Jackson for the Kansas City
Royals? Manager John Wathan
plans to platoon Jim Eisenreich
and Gary,'Ihurman in left ﬁeld
and expects rightfielder Danny
T artabull to step up the offense.
It's not a question of who will
replace Bo as much as each
individual raising his game a bit.

For a team that has so many
problems, the Royals still have
the best starting rotation in the
American League. Bret
Saberhagen is due for a big
season, and Mark Gubicza should
return to the form that won him
35 games in 1988-89. The Royals
spent megabucks on ‘Mike
Boddicker (17-8, 3.56), and with
good reason. Kevin Appier and
T om Gordon will only get better.

The Minnesota Twins will be
led, as always, by Kirby Puckett

and‘Kent Hrbek, but there isn’t 

much behind these two, so the
Twins will be forced to scrape for
runs. A steady leadoff hitter would
help, but something tells me that
Dan Gladden might not fit the
bill. Shane Mack could emerge as
a star this season. Kevin Tapani,
Scott Erickson and Mark Guthrie
are all exciting young pitchers
who will develop into a
formidable staff, but it’s doubtful
that this will happen in ‘91.

Cat Ballou is busy preparing
itself to be pulled from the murky
waters of poor support in
Pittsburgh by casting its own line.
It provides the bait with its “Big
City Sound," a phrase coined by
the band to describe its
“cosmopolitan, worldly sound,”
and it hopes that a record
producer will swallow the hook.

With each member contributing
individual knowledge and talent
to the effort, Cat Ballou has its
hands on the reel. Compared to
Pat Benatar one too many times,
lead singer Marla Degenhardt
takes advantage of the sweeping
guitar and danceable rhythm that
permeates the band’s music,
belting out strong and sensuous
vocals that seem to contradict her
petite frame. As lyricist, she

“Politics and business is what
it’s all about. These two areas, as
unrelated as they may
immediately seem to playing
music, are integral to success in
the business, “ says Bruni.

Deciding to take some time off
to hone its skills in the studio, the
band launched its strategic plan
for publicity a year ago.

“We really wanted to go about
this in a business sort of way.

STUDENT AFFAIRS
Office of the Vice President

April 9, 1991

Dear University Colleague:

For most of us in Western Pennsylvania three meals a day are
assured. For approximately 200,000 of our neighbors, however, it
is a luxury that doesn't always happen. in: help address this
problem the University will again participate in the Scouting for
Food campaign, a food collection drive sponsored by the Allegheny
Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America. I am enclosing a copy
of a brochure that explains the program and a food collection bag.

You.can help with this vital project by bringing nonperishable
food and grocery items to the University from April 16 to 18, and
putting them in the hampers placed at strategic locations in most
University buildings. While any canned food in good condition is
welcome, there are several types of foods which are preferred
because of-their nutritional unit value: peanut butter, chunky-
type soups, canned tuna, canned stews, canned meats, baby formula
or any complete packaged meal.

Once collected the food items will be provided to the area's
450 food pantries and kitchens for‘ distribution to needy
individuals. A growing concern with this year's campaign is the
large number of single mothers who are turning to the food kitchens
and pantries for assistance. Today, nearly 60% of the food
collected goes to help women and children. ' a

Last year the University's contribution was tremendous with
6,984 items of food collected. Your support of Pitt's Scouting for
Food effort this year will be greatly appreciated.i Thank you for
your help in responding to this critical community need.

_ Wgcerely, #
