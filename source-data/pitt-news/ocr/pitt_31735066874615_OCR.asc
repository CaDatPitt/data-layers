Freshmen Set

‘Dance Date

The Gold Room at Carnegie
Music Hall has been chosen
as the site for the ﬁrst fresh-
man-s p‘ o n s o r e d university
dance. Called “The Aeneid
Ball,” the affair will carry out
a Greek theme which will be
accented the night of Jan. 14 by

huge decorative columns in the
Gold Room.

The highlight of the evening
will be the awarding of a grand
prize to the couple who knows
what the letters E.O.G.T.T.T.S.F'.
mean. The letters’ refer to a
factual statement concerning
Pitt. Clues will be given in sub-
sequent issue of the Pitt News
up to the Friday of the dance.

Benny Benack and his orchestra
will play at the semi-formal. It is
open to all Pitt students. Tickets
for the dance may be purchased
for $2.75 a couple from freshmen
class ofﬁcers or at the Student
Desk.  7

Despite setbacks by Student
Congress and the SC Social Com-
mittee which have failed to
grant wholehearted support to
the freshmen efforts, class of-
ﬁcers are optimistic that the
Aeneid Ball will be a success.
They have the backing of the
Dean of Men’s and Dean of

- Women's offices which look upon
the new program as a welcome
innovation to university and
freshman class activities.

Headed by Arnold Landy, pres-
ident.-of the 1958 Bus Ad, Class,
officers of the College, E&M
School, and Pharmacy school have
been working on. the affair since
early December.’ 1 '

It is the ﬁrst time ‘the Fresh-
man Class, both men and women
of all colleges, have combined to

sponsor a university function.‘

BY NANCY

-Pitt students apparently are of the rubber stamp variety.
Atleast that’s the conclusion that could be drawn from a poll
of 90 women and 90 men taken recently by a journalism class.
It seems the students think alike ‘on questions _of major in-

terest to them. ‘ »

For example, most students think men should be drafted

They are as undecided as Congress on whether citizens should

vote at 18 or 21. They believ

e couples should be married

between 20 and 25. They have come to school to “get an

educat_ion,” and they have estab—¢

lished definite goals for later life.
A An overwhelming majority,

140 of those interviewed,
thought .men should be drafted
at 18. Mr. and Miss Pitt rea-
soned that thus Uncle Sam
wouldn’t interrupt the indi-
vidual’s college plans and that
army life helps the high school
graduate mature. Government
benefits and the idea. of “getting
it over with early” spurredpsome
to take this stand.

_ The controversy‘ of ‘whether or
not a. citizen should be able to vote
at 18 or 21 continues. However,
more of the students at Skyscraper
U ‘tend to think he voting age
should say at 21. Because, said the
future leaders of America, before
that time‘ they’re “not mature
enough to vote intelygenlyf Quite
a few felt that maturity and inde-

‘ Over and. over in rebuttal to
this argument came the catch
phrase, “If,‘they’re old -enough to
fight, they’re old enough to vote.”
Many on this ‘side of the fence
thought 18-year-olds were “ as
qualified as 21-year-olds to exer-
cise the franchise." .
‘ Right Age to Marry
The question that provoked the
most head scratching‘ was, “At
what age were your parents mar-
ried?” On this and other factors
Mr. and Miss Average Pittite were
asked to_ decide upon the “right”
age for ma iageg. 1-
The idea age ranges between
\ 20 and 25, they decided. Many
students ‘ took an intelligent
viewpoint however, and stipu-
lated that it depends on when

you are mentally and financially
tready for marriage. Men par-

The people interviewed were
preparing themselves ~for many
different ﬁelds. Many wanted to
be doctors, lawyers, engineers,
schoolmarms, journalists, retail-
ers, dentists, and businessmen.
They say they have come to the
University to get an education.
Surprisingly enough they seldom
gave “more money” or “better
jobs” as reasons. Men and women
of today are choosing their future»
vocations becausethey like them
and are ‘interested in them-.

Co-eds Don’t Want a Man

The belief that co-eds go to col-
lege to catch a man seems dis-
proved. The young “women said
they, also, are here to further
their education, although some ad-
mitted college increased ‘their
chances of latching on to a man.

In connection with the matter
of future occupation, a query
concerning retirement in this
social - security - conscious age,
yielded some interesting results.
A majority of males said they
are not looking forward to re-’
tirement. Apparently they‘ are
intent on their. careers and con-
sider retirement “too far away.”

But don’t be misled. A large
minority are anticipating the day
when they can relax with a big
fat cigar, in an overstuffed easy
chair. In any case Joe College is

age age for retiring ranged most-
often between 55 and 70.
Three Children Desired

The family of tomorrow will
have three children. Men at Pitt
consider marriage a favorable
institution and are pretty well set
on about two to four children. The
co-eds agreed with this approxi-
mation although they were more
likely to say four, five, or over,
than the men.

However, Miss Pitt, said she
was willing to work to support
her family. The majority of co-
eds said they would work, at
least “for a while”,Tafter mar-
riage. —

These conclusions collected by
the feature writing class, conduct-A

beyond a ‘doubt that Mr. and Miss

issues and a sharp eye on the
future.

Discount Service Heads

SC New Year Agenda 

With the success

By AL LEFFLER

of the ﬁrst class ofﬁcer sponsored Com-
mons Room Dance, a feather in their caps, Student Congress

started the year at their meeting .on Monday with reports
on polls being conducted for student discounts in Pitts-
burgh stores and the revival of a humor magazine.

‘ A1 Boll is "conducting'a poll to determine whether or
not the students will support a discount program with the

local merchants.

With the support of~Pitt in addition te‘ Tech, Duquesne, ‘
PCW, and Mt. Mercy, the discount could amount to as much ‘

as 20%, since the combined enrollment of the ﬁve‘ local

colleges is over 20,000. ¢
Philadelphia, Boston and‘ 23
other cities have worked the dis-

Under such a plan, students are
given a rebait on services and
goods so tha}t‘they might live more
cheaply while attending college:
The poll will not only suggest
what types of businesses to be
included, but will ‘name the fav-
orite local merchants. At first the
discount will only be -op en to
undergraduate students,‘ with
hopes of expansion in later years.

Another committee, led by
Tony Arabia, is trying to revive
a humorous literary magazine,
“such as the Panther, by means
of a poll. » 1

The‘ last four. issues of the Pan-
ther were considered literary
flops, since they lacked the humor
of the previous issues, and had
only poor layout, paper quality,

effort. ,

The only probable way that
the Publications Board will ap-
prove the new magazines is with
the promise of good, clean hum-
or, a better layout, and definite
organization, according to Bill
Rimmel, editor of the Sky-
scraper Engineer and one of the

 

revival backers.
Stan Greenﬁeld,
the Appointments committee, fin-

ally presented and got approval

for the definition of his commit-
tee’s duties. .

‘ He outlined with six points the
procedure to be followed with
future University events.

' 1. His committee shall appoint.

the chairman of the dance, the
business manager and the pub-
licity chairman.

2. The chairman will be from
the sponsoring class.

3. The chairman of the spring
dance will be from the junior class
and the fall dance chairman will
be from the senior class.

— 4. The class officers will work
along with the chairmen, but shall
not necessarily hold the positions.

5. The committee chairmen‘
will be from-the sponsoring class.

6. SC shall support and promote

of Pitt’s Virus Research Lab-
oratory, announced Sunday
that about 9000 children in 36

polio vaccine.
The boosters, given during
the past two months, followed

winter and spring.

According to D-r. Salk the last
set is designed chieﬂy to de-
termine the number of shots a
child needs to gain protection
against the disease, how often
they must be given, and in what
dosage.

inoculate-d children will also be
studied. B1-oo-d samples, drawn
from youngsters before boosters
were administered, a-re being
checked at Dr. Salk’s laboratory
in Municipal Hospital for clues
determining whether the vaccine
prevents polio bugs from entering
a person’s system or whether bugs
enter without causing damage.

Researchers hope the vaccine
does permit harmless
.Thus if an inoculated youngster
is subjected to a polio bug, im-
munity would be automatically
boosted without additional in-
jections. ‘

Tests indicate, so far, that this
is what takes place, though it is
still too early to be certain.

Blood tests will also"determine
the degree of immunity generated
by the different batches of vac-
cine used. in the studies.

Current studies involve 30
schools in Pittsburgh and six "in
other parts o-f Allegheny County.
Most of the children are in the
second, third, and fourth grades.
Some in older classes have also
been included.

He has in-ocula-ted about 15,000
persons in the Pittsburgh district

Education Progress in Libya A

On Saturday, Jan. 8 at 1:15 p.m.

will be interviewed about their
work in Libya on station WJAS,
by Blanch Anderson on the Con-
gress of Clubs Forum.

Dr. Lingren, an associate pro-
fessor of education at the Uni-
-versity of Pittsburgh, returned this
fall after a two yea-r leave of
absence, during which he was
employed by the Foreign Oper-
ations Administration (formerly
Point Four).' * ,

Dr. Lingren points out that the
‘idea originally behind Point Four
was “to help uniderdeveloped peo-
ples to help themselves”.

In his capacity as Educational

Libya, Dr. Lingren served in
various ways to help the Libyans
help themselves. »

His administration established
two new teachers’ training
schools, one fo-r women and one
for men,
schools into effective working in-
struments, established s u "m m e 1‘.
and afternoon courses, and di-
seminated information into the
rem.ote villages by means of a
bookmobile. A

All expenses encountered by
Dr. Lingren and his associates
were ﬁnanced‘ by the United
“States ‘Government.

The Lingrens brought over
1,500 feet of motion pictures and
a number of colored slides from
North Africa. They have shown
these at meetings of educational

Dr. Paul H. Masoner, former acting head of the School
of Education, has succeeded Dr. Samuel P. Franklin who is
relinquishing his deanship because of ill health. His appoint-
ment became effective Jan. 1.

In a letter to Dr. Franklin, Vice Chancellor Charles B.

Nutting said, “I am sure you will be pleased to know that
we have concluded that Dr. Paulv

Masoner should become dean. He
has been doing a tremendously
fine job since you have been

away, and has won the support of 

his colleagues as well as the con-
fidence of Dr. Fitzgerald and my-

self. Your wise selection of him as ,
assistant deanlhas made it possi- .

ble for him to carryon his duties
most effectively during a rather
difficult time.”

Dr. Masoner joined the Pitt

faculty’ in 1945 as a counselor;
he became an associate profes-
sor in 1946, and a full professor
in 1953. Named assistant dean in
the School of Education last

‘ dean upon Dr. Franklin’s illness.
The new dean was born in Mid-
dletown, 0., in 1908. He attended
Capital University in Columbus,
0., and Ohio State University
where he received his‘ bachelor
and master of arts degrees. He
received his degree of doctor of
philosophy from the University of
Pittsburgh.

Dr. Masoner is a member of
the National Education Associa-
tion, Pennsylvania ‘State Educa-
tion Association, National Voca-
tional Guidance Association, Phi
Delta Kappa, Pittsburgh Per-
sonnel Association, Allegheney
County Civic Club, Kiwanis,

Fantastic magazine. ’

The science ﬁction story en-
titled, “The Gun,” tells of a 12
year old boy trapped in a cave
with a box-top type plastic ray
gun that proves dangerous. Locale
of the; story is near Pittsburgh,
according to Daley.

A graduate of the University
of Pittsburgh, Daley has been a

Coeds Organize
Twirling Corps
With New Hope

_The success and interest of
W 0 In e n cheerleaders has

prompted the formation of a
women’s twirling corps at Pi-tt.

 

DR. PAUL H. MASONER
Dean of the School of Education

Under the guidance of Larry
Cervi, drum major of the_ Pitt
band, and Maxine Carney, local
dancing instructor, the new group
will begin rehearsals Jan. 12.

All women interested in join-
ing the Pitt Twirling Corp-s should
sign up at the student desk be-
tween Jan. 5' and 12. Organizers,
under the supervision and sanc-
tion of the athletic department,
are optimistic that coeds will soon
be performing at athle-tic con-tests.

Places are open to approxi-
mately 48 women who do not
necessarily need to have previous
training as baton etwirlers. Coeds
who have performed in high
school are preferred, however.

Requirements for m«ajorettes are
(1) average height, (2) good
physical and mental condition, (3)

operate. All applicants must be
full-time students at the Univers-
ity.

Blind Helped
To Sense pace
II/ith Reflexes

The uncanny sense of “position
in space” and‘the ‘facility for
accurate movement possessed by
most blind people are due in great
part to the reﬂex action of their
knee joints, according to research
being done by Dr. Leonard A.
Cohen,_assis-tant professor of phy-
siology and pharmacology in Pitt’s
School of Medicine, under a grant
from the National ‘Institute of
Nuerological Diseases and Blind-
Iness.

Dr. Cohen explains that the
knee jfoint may be a key point in
the human nerve-communication
system. By ﬂashing signals over
the nerve pathways to the brain,
it may tell the blind person a
great deal about his movements

and the position of his body in ,

relation to space.

. “All joints of the body are sus-
pected of having a position sense
function,” according to the pro-
fessor, “but the knee joint seems
to be one of the most important
and most interesting for initial
investigation.”

During the past year Dr. Cohen
has succeeded in recording elec-

_tronically the “firings” of impulses

from the knee joint nerve in res-
ponse to joint movements. He
wa-nts to further learn what sig-
nals, other than pain, are ﬂashed

by the action of reﬂexes in the _

knee joint. _

Dr. Cohen’s research, along with
a report from a group of English
investigators, marks the ﬁrst proof
that sensory terminals in the knee
joint, signaling movements and
position, may actually exist.

 Segregation And. . .

‘I By Irv Rofhman

Chicago wasn’t engulfed by
tidal I waves and no one con-
demned Santa Claus for wearing

’‘ red, but despite these disappoint-
ments the past two weeks have
proven interesting.

Big news, was the reversal of
the F r e n c h
Assembly on
its G e r m a n
r e a r mament
decision. Pre-
mier ;Mendes-
France ﬁnally
persuaded re-
luctant repre-
sentatives t o

W e s t Euro-
pean U n i o n
which will put
500,000 West‘ German troops un-

A der arms. .

Both Eisenhower and Aden-
auer received their Christmas
presents. And Gen. Alfred
/Gruenther, NATO leader, who
has been planning the procedure
for rearmament‘ for over a year
can put his delayed plans into
effect. Mende-s-France stays in
power and can now devote his

' ‘time to economic and social im-

provements, which might even
przrve a tougher ordeal.

Russians Se-l' Protest Record-

Alarmed at the rearmament of
West Germany, Russian diplo-
_mats" have been setting new rec-
ords in sending but notes of pro-
test. In ﬁve days they sent 18
notes threatening and complain-
ing to 16 countries.

France and Great Britain were
threatened 'with revocation “of
friendship treaties signed after
Worid War II. Even the U.S. got
a note which condemned a recent

statement‘ by an Air Force gen-.
. eral who implied that his Bri-,

tain-based planes could carry an
atomic bombing attack to the

 

Soviet Union.
~ Disappointed over the refusal
of 14 countries to attend an “All-
European security” conference
in Moscow, hammer and sickle
men blasted Western Allies.
Mississippi Misses
But while biological science
took a major step forward, social
science received a set back. Gov.
Hugh White of Mississippi called
a special legislature meeting Jan.
11 to'er_1act. laws, to preserve seg-
regation in the state’s schools.
Dec. 21 voters there passed a
special referendum by a two-to-
one majority permitting abolition
of public schools if necessary.
Mississippi joins Georgia and
South Carolina in maneuvers to
outwit the unanimous supreme
court decision which authorized
integration. The tempers of
southern and northern lawyers
will rise as they ﬁght for ‘the
rights they believe‘, 'nherent-
one for white supnemacy; the
other for a chance at equal op-

portunities.

Oppenheimer on Life

But for the complexities of
life, Atomic physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer had something im-
portant to say. The head of the
Institute for Study at Princeton,
N.J. called love and friendship
the great hopes of modern man.

He left CBS listeners with
these w_ords which could lead to
some thinking on the part of the
audience: “for one man to know ’
much, we live too variously to
live as one.

“Our histories and traditions—— 4

the very meaning of interpreting
life--are both bonds and barriers
among us . . . the artist’s lone-
liness, the scholar despairing, be-
cause no one will any longer
trouble to learn that he can
teach, the narrowness of the sci-
entist, these are most unnatural
insignia in this great time of
change.”

a

By Jim Deweese

Samuel Johnson has been quoted as saying
“. . . a mam seldom thinks with more earnestness
of anything than he does of his dinner.” .

Our present society seems to pay less attention
to its’ digestive tracts than‘Jo'hnson would have
us believe. Society notwithstanding, however, eat-
ing still ranks near the top of the list as a pleasant
interlude and a valid excuse for‘;
abandoning the cares -of the day.

Here at Pitt, there are places i
to eat. The faculty club is Plush, ,
the food pretty "good, and the 
entire premises reserved for ’
members of the faculty and ad-
ministration. _' -

The Blue Tuck "Shop along
with its red counterpart serves
to accomodate a limited number . _
of students although the students don’t realize that
they are limited. The surroundings are pleasant
and the food is fair. No hot meals‘ are served in
the tuck shops, this task having been relegated
to the cafeteria, which is the oneremaining spot
in the Cathedral in which food may be obtained.

And it is a spot. The fact that food may be
purchased and consumed without regard to the
surroundings does nothing to deny the insult which
the cafeteria serves to the students of this Uni-
_versity. V A S
A Low Blow ,

The initial blowis delivered by the 64 scarred
grey tables which stand upon shaky legs and
threaten to deposit all dishes upon the dust grey
cement of the ﬂoor, asﬂoor which bears 30 or more
wide ﬁssures each of which has as many tributaries
as the Mississippi River at ﬂood stage.

The‘ lnwer portion of the walls carries out the
grey‘ motif of the ﬂoor. A washed out yellow cov-
ers the rest of the rough plaster and bare lath which
extends to the ceiling.

In the North——North East corner of the room
three uncovered hot and cold, water pipes rise in-
gloriously from the floor and disappear _into the
unﬁnished ceiling. In the opposite corner there
stands only one riser, but this has another pipe
branching from it at the three foot level.

  

It's No Picnic

At various points in the cafeteria, there stand
24 pillars. These sometimes square, sometimes
trapazoidal columns sport rough patches of plaster
which have been painted wth no attempt made to
smooth them over. '
Just Plain Stones

The West wall, which sweeps in a magnificent
curve over perhaps a quarter of the room, reveals
527 bricks. Not» ﬁnishing bricks, but bricks which
should have been covered with, at least, a plaster
coat.. Instead, they were covered with a skim coat
of the samevyellow—white paint which adorns the
other walls. ’

The North wall features the open ends of two
“I” beams extending from its surface and looking
as though they had erupted from -the wall. The
wall, at that_point, has the general facial charac-
teristics of a long dormant volcano.

Fifteen or more beams criss-cross the ceiling
and serve as anchors for the 22 lights which hang
dejectedly in their frosted bowls. One “bare bulb
hangs in the ‘North East corner.

Thai-'s All Brother

The food and the service, the napkins dispens-
ers and salt and pepper shakers on each table are
as good as those in most cafeterias. That’s all.

Still the University continues to invite large-
groups to the Cathedral for various functions. These
groups must be servedtheir meals in the cafeteria.

Many such events are designed toicreate within
high school students a desire to enroll at Pitt. The
High School Publications] Institute, which brings
hundreds of high schqol students here every year,
is such an. event. That extension of the boiler
room known as theicafeteria does little to serve
these ends.

Other events, such as debate tournaments, stu-
dent government meetings, etc. bring students and

-instructors from all over the United States to this

University. It is a well known fact that one bad
impression will stay with a person longer than ten
good ones. Thus the splendor of the nationality
rooms and the magniﬁcence of the Cathedral it-
self are dimmed by the cafeteria.

The cafeteria has been‘ in operation for many
years but the only changes ever made are burned
out light bulbs. ‘ '

Polio Grant Given
To Foster Tests

National Foundation for Infan-
tile Paralysis has granted $80,705
to the University for study of _the
spread of polio and mechanisms
of immunity.

Dr. William Hammon, Pitt pro-
fessor of epidemiology, will head
the study to be based on blood and
other specimens collected from in-
dividuals at Clark Air Force Base,
Philippine Islands, and from pa-
tients in gamma globulin studies.

Dr. Hammon was responsible
for gamma globulin ﬁeld trials
of 1951-52 which showed that a
low level‘ of polio-ﬁghting anti-
bodies in human blo-od could pro-
vide temporary protection.

For the new experiments Dr.
Hammon and.his amociates have
obtained a number of unidentiﬁed
with ill-
nesses resembling mild polio to
clarify the relationship of these
viruses to polio.

In addition, Dr. Hammon will
study response to infection in
p e rs o n s previously immunized
through either gamma globulin or
a polio infection.

The grant was presented to Dr.
Robert A. Moore, Pitt health
school vice chancellor, by’ Edward
H. Gallup, chairman, Allegheny’
County Chapter, National Foun-
dation for Infantile Paralysis.

MY COUSIN HASKELL

I have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haske1l’s
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes:

Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too), N

I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes";

. I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
you why I don’t smoke them.

It all started the very ﬁrst day I arrived at college. I had just
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Barney Google,
and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when
all of a_sudden I ran into this fellow witha blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman. I said‘ yes. He asked‘
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas; I said yes. He
said the only way to make all these keen things happen was to
join. a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn’t tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I’ll ﬁnd ‘
out when I go active. .

Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a ﬁne because I missed the meeting. When I
remind him that I can’t go to meetings because I don’t know where
the house is, he twists my arm. .

I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it is my
dearest wish to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn’t cheap. It wouldn’t be so bad if I slept
at the house, but you must agree that I can’t very well sleep at
the house if I don’t know where the house is.)

I have had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,
but it isn’t the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costermonger, which is dingy, expensive, uncom-
fortable, inconvenient, and I don’t; even get to use the bed till six
o’clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his costers.

Well, anyhow, I got settled and started going to classes. But ﬁrst
I had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked the burs_ar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn’t taking any labs,
he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white mice. When I offered to bring my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm. ‘

So I paid the man and went to my classes where I found that
all my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text-

books. Over to the bookstore I went, saw the prices on the ”"',t-
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovc" (I
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but tip .d

me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. '1 here
was nothing for it but to buy the books.

Next I turned to romance-—and found it. Harriet, her name was -—a
great, strapping girl. I ﬁrst spied her leaning against the statue'of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little
eyes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me off to a dimly lit place called The Trap where everything was
a la carte. She ordered cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin chateaubriand
($7.00), a scuttle of french fries (1849 the french fry), an artichoke
(30¢ the leaf), and compote (8009 the prune). ’

After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which .I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched her huge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together . . . But nothing
worked, and ﬁnally I had to sling her over my shoulder and carry
her to the girls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route. _

But it_was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. Fortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,
like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal-
pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, letme keep the nurses.

_ So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I don’t like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I ﬂip when I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. But I can’t
afford cigarettes. I can’t even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical care. ' .

Well, I'll write you again soon. Keep ’em ﬂying.

Yr. Cousin,-
Haskell

Panther Cubs Go
For Sixth Straight

Against Covies

Flying high on. the crest of. a
five game winning streak‘, the
Panther freshmen feel c-onﬁdent
that they will continue their un-
beaten ways against the Geneva
junior varsity in tonight’s pre-
liminary game to the Pitt-Geneva
varsity contest, ‘

“We haven’t had any trouble
from this team in the past and I
don’t see why’ we need to worry
about them this year,” stated
Coach Carl Pete-rson as he voiced
his‘ squad’s optimism. However,

_ Peterson did add the standard

comment of all coaches, “Butyou
never can tell.”

_ In their first ﬁve contests the
Cubs encountered trouble only
from the Carnegie Tech freshmen
whoifell before the Pittites 71-64.
In their most recent game, the
Cub hoopsters rolled to their most
impressive victory of the season
by beating the Johnstown Center
quintet 85--52.

Coach Peterson expects to start
the same ﬁve which has kept the
Fros-h record spotless. Julius
Peg-ues and Chuck Hursh, the two
high scorers on the squad, will
start at the foward positions. At
center will be Phil Kleinman,
while Freddie Yee and Bill Dillon
will hold d-own the guard posi-
tions. Expected to see some action
in tonight’s contest are reserves
Howie Lester, Ed Kramer, and
Bob Mathias.

In the Johnstown encounter,
Pegues pushed his total points
over the century mark to 101

tallies. Pegues is averaging 20.5
. points per game while Hursh is

averaging 11.8.

Grid Coaching Jobs Still Open;

J ansante Rumored In Line

Speculation over who will ﬁll the vacancies on the foot-
ball coaching staif has intensiﬁed as spring drills are only
three months away. The Panthers’ new head coach, Johnny
Michelosen, has stated that he is in the market for twoline
coaches and a backﬁeld coach to complete his staff. ’

will be End Coach Bob Timmons,
Line Coach Ernie Hefferle, ‘and
the two. freshmen mentors, Steve
Petro and Carl DePasqua.

The depature of Bill Bevan and
Bob Friedlund along with Michel-
elevation to the head
coaching position in‘ place of Red
Dawson has created the present
vacancies. 5 3

Although it is known that many
applications have been received,
Coach Michelosen would not di-
vulge the names of any of the
‘candidates. Val Jansante, former
star end of the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers, is rumored to be in the run-
ning for one of the openings. He
played under Michelosen’s tutl-
edge in the pro ranks.

Intramural Sports
Back on Schedule

With the end of the holidays,
Intramural sports swung back
into full action this iweek with
basketball and ' badminton lead-
ing the way.

Intramural wrestling will take
place before the end of the
semester so all hopeful wrestlers
should start working.

If there is enough interest
shown in a ‘prospective horseshoe
pitching tournament, there will
be a one night elimination tourna-
me-nt_before the semester ends. ,

All those interested in entering
either IM wrestling or the horse-
shoe pitching tournament may
sign up at the Student Desk.

_New Year's_
In Philly

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

 

Spending New Year’s Day in Philadelphia” to play a
basketball game may not seem like the best way to end a
vacation but to the Panther basketeers, the trip was well
worth the effort. .

And, effort it was, since the hoopsters had to cut their
New Year’s Eve celebrations short for some sleep before
catching a plane at 8 am. Saturday morning for Philly.

‘ ,That evening, though, made up for whatever was

missed the previous night as the Timmons’ boys pulled
an overtime 81-75 upset over an unbeaten Penn squad
that had been favored by 13 points in the bettors’ line.
Coincidentally, the last time Pitt visited the Palestra
in 1952, the story. was reversed almost exactly as Penn
swept to a 81-76 victory in overtime. \

The contest also continued to show the Panthers’ suprema-
cy over eastern schools as they added the Quakers'to.the
Fordha.m, Colgate,,and New York University_ victory list.

Now, if they can maintain this hex‘ the remainder of
the season, the ﬁnal record will have more on the left side
of the hyphen than last year’s 9-14 ﬁgure.

OTHER PHILLY FACTS——Villanova met North Carolina
State in the second half of the Palestra double header but
almost all the fans showed up for the Panther tilt and this
twinbill outdrew the Kentucky-Temple game two blocks
away at Convention Hall. - -

Miltie Wolf, the Panther’s head basketball manager,
met Coach Adolph Rupp of the Kentuckians, who stayed
at the same hotel, on the. elevator and in the process
asked him about his squad. “They’re still a little green,”
was the Bluegrass baron’s caustic reply to the team
that’s rated No. 1 in the nation. -

North Carolina State, which was toppled from the un-
defeated ranks by Villanova, has a roster of eleven men and

‘not one of them is from the state of North Carolina. This

gives a pretty good idea of the type of recruiting done by
this basketball—minded school.

Penn, too, is a university that draws from out-of-
town although this holds true for their whole student
body and not just the cagers. I Hardly any Philadelphians
attend the school even though it’s located right in the
city just like Pitt . . . and, it’s not hard to tell a Penn
man from the rest either, because in this college every-
one wears grey —ﬂannels, fraternity man or not.

Bob Schafer, the Villanova ace, knows he’s the main
cog in the Wildcat’s success andhe shows it. During the time-
outs he goes over to the bench and sits down while the
coach talks to the other players. 1

The announcer at the Palestra tells the fans just how
many personal fouls each man has as he gets them and that
might be a good idea for the Field House mikeman.

Michigan State First Toughie
On Wrestling Suicide Schedule

. By STEVE BUTCHOCK '
Nearly everyone was talking about the suicide schedule
of the Panther football team this past season but Coach Rex
Peery doesn’t have to concede anything when he glances at

_ the card prepared for his wrestlers.

The ﬁrst dual meet on the eleven match schedule is this
coming Saturday at East Lansing, against the Michigan State
Spartans-—third place ﬁnishers in the Big Ten Conference
last year. 6

Other Big Ten engagements are
with Purdue who finished first in
conference competition last year,

.Arch-rival West Virginia and
powerful Lock Haven are the

Michigan ‘who took second, and
Illinois who placed fourth.

The Perrymen got a preview of
the Michigan aggregation over
the; holidays when they were de-
throned by the Wolverines, 52-63,
in the Wilkes College open wrest-
ling tournament at Wilkes—Barre.
The Michigan school fought from
a 23-24 quarter-final deficit to
take the title. '

Feature attractions have also
been carded with Penn State and
Lehigh who finished second and
third respectively behind the Blue
and Gold in eastern circles in
1954. Lehigh, winner of the Wilkes
College tourney in 1951 and 1952,

finished third with 38 points.

other significant opponents that
the locals must face during the
current season in addition to Cor-
nell, Syracuse, and Toledo.

Thus the foregoing schedule,
coupled with the loss of six letter-
men from" last year’s once-beaten
team, dangles a yoemanlike task
in the path of the Peerymen who
lost such steadies as Hugh Peery,
George Matthews, and Charley
Uram from last year’s team.

However, the return of letter-
men Joe Solomon, Bill Kozy, Ed
DeWitt-, and ‘Bob Cook, -supple--
mented by the upcoming frosh
team, is expected to continue the
Panther wrestling upsurge of the
past three years.

by Alden Burnham, vice-
Soccer Committee. Players

were chosen on the basis of a rating system involving the

votes of all coaches and officials:
in the district.

Placed at goalie on the'ﬁrst

who led the Panthers to an 8-1

record w hi 1 e

opposition a 11

rise from an

the best goalie
in the east was
one of the ma-
jor surprises in

this year, a s
was the phenomenal rise of the
Pitt team.

Second team selections included
the Panthers’ record—breaking
scorer, John D’Amato, who score-d
15 goals during the past season
at center forward, and Mike Cul-
hane, the high—sc'o=ring defensive
bulwark, at center half. Cul-hane

Among those who received
honorable mention were Norm

Riflers Drop First
With Duquesne; ,
Two Vets Star

Panther riﬂérs got off to a rather
shaky start in Greater Pittsburgh
Riﬂe — League competition by
dropping the season’s ﬁrst match
to Duque-sne at the latter’s range,
1377-1349.

Although Panthers, Tom. Shep-
pard and David Jacobson turned
in the ‘evening’s top perfo-rmences,
a pepped up Duquesne team
would not be thwarted. By win-
ning, the Dukes stopped a Pitt
streak that “ had held the Bluff
riﬂers without a win in three
years in the cross—to—wn rivalry

Sgt. Gromko, Panther coach,
believes that the main reason for
the defeat was in the erratic
shooting of the Panthers, which
found Sheppard and Jacobson
shooting’ at 29-0 while the team
average was but 270.

A freshman riﬂe team has also
been organized for the coming
year and will feature several boys
who ﬁred for the freshman ROTC»
riﬂe team.

In addition to several matches
against district college freshman
teams, the novice riﬂers will pit
their skill against almost every
freshman riﬂe team in the coun-
try in the National Riﬂe Associ-

"Matches are conducted like any

Navy Gives Pitt‘
Research Grant

A $225,000 research grant has
been given the University by the
United States Navy Bureau of»
Aeronautics to study
ordinance equipment. 1.

Dr. G. R. Fitterer, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
said that the grant calls for the
study of certain electronic gear
and the metallurgical investi-
gation of certain strategic parts.

Since 1943, when Pitt received
its ﬁrst grant, work has been done
to help the Navy to learn why
ordinance parts failed in combat
and to perfect equipment so that
it will operate more efficiently
and without failures.

Fitterer said that because of
some of the research work done
here, aviation ordinance failures
during the Korean war were non-
existent.

Campbell C. Yates, professor of
mechanical engineering in charge
of the aeronautical engineering
division at Pitt, is supervising the
project. .

Richard J. Erdlac, assistant pro-
fessor of mechanical engineering,
and Henry F. Andrejasik, re-

aviation

search engineer, are assisting on
the project. <

srunams ARE ECSTATIC about Luckies. That’s the word,
straight from the latest, largest college survey ever. Again,
the No. 1 reason Luckies lead in colleges over all other
brands, coast to coast — border to border: Luckies taste
better. They taste better, ﬁrst of all, because Lucky Strike
means ﬁne tobacco. Then, that tobacco is toasted to taste
better. This famous Lucky Strike process tones up Luckies’
light, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better.
So be smart, like the student in the Droodle above, titled:
Lucky smoker swinging in hammock. Swing to Luckies your-
self. Enjoy the better-tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
