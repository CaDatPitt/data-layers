Health
Department
investigates E.
coli infections in
Oakland

Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

Five customers or employees of The Porch at
Schenley, an Oakland restaurant, have been
diagnosed with E. coli infections since Oct. 1.

Four ofthe ﬁve individuals were hos-
pitalized.

As a means to stop the spread of the bac-
teria, the Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment asked health care providers to test
individuals for the Escherichia coli O157:H7
strain if they present symptoms.

Allegheny County Health Director Karen
Hacker encouraged individuals with symp-
toms to contact their health care providers,
as well as the Health Department.

“.We’re urging health care providers to
test for E. coli to see if there are any addi-
tional cases linked to this outbreak so we can
stop further transmission of the disease,”
she said.

Pat Ritz, a spokesman for The Porch
noted that the restaurant is “trying to be
very proactive.”

The restaurant additionally created a
toll—free hotline to ﬁeld questions from the

Vigil summons tales of the supernatural

The 42—story gothic tower piercing Pitts-
burgh’s skyline looks like it was constructed
speciﬁcally for Halloween night.

Between the chilling limestone walls and
incandescent chandeliers that hangforebod-
ingly far below the arched ceiling, the Ca-
thedral of Learning evokes the supernatural

with its medieval charm.

E. Maxine Bruhns, director of the nation-
ality rooms, will allow the public to test the
Cathedral’s haunted reputation during a tour
of the notorious Early American Nationality
Room. She will host a “ host watch” tonight
from 6 to 8 p.m. inthe Cathedral of Learning.

The Early American Nationality Room,
located on the third ﬂoor, holds a great deal
of mystery for visitors who have experienced

inexplicable activity in the room. According
to legend, the ghost of Bruhns’s late grand-
mother, Martha Jane Poe, began to haunt
the room after her possessions were used
to furnish the upstairs bedroom.

Poe is said to be a cousin of one ofAmer—
ica’s best—known horror writers, Edgar Al-

Student group seeks tocombatr eating disorders

Lindsay Passodelis
Staﬁ” Writer

At 12 years old, Liana Rosenman was di- ’

agnosed with an eating disorder.

The disorder presented a major chal-
lenge in her life, and it occurred at a time
that also marked a turning point for many
other girls in the world struggling with
their respective body images.

The National Eating Disorders Associa-
tion, a U.S. nonproﬁt dedicated to help-
ing those affected by eating disorders,
published a 2011 study on the prevalence
and correlations of eating disorders in
adolescents. Researchers studied indi-
viduals between 8 and 25 years old with

anorexianervosa, bulimia nervosa or other ”

eating disorders. .

According to the study, the crude mor-
tality rates — or number of annual deaths
per 1,000 people — amounted to 4 per-
cent for anorexia nervosa, 3.9 percent for
bulimia nervosa and 5.2 percent for other
eating disorders. They also found a high
suicide rate among people who suffer from
bulimia nervosa.

Last fall, Pitt students Ellen Majersky
and Kaitlyn Waugaman opened a chapter
of the national organization Project HEAL,
which stands for Help to Eat, Accept and
Live. The co-presidents formed the Pitt
chapter to spread both awareness about
eating disorders and a message of hope
and healing. The group utilizes presenta-
tions, ﬂyers and other methods to spread
its message and donates raised funds di-
rectly tothe national foundation.

Rosenman and Kristina Saffran found-
ed Pr_oject HEAL in the spring of 2008.
They created the nonproﬁt organization

to raise money for victims of eating disor-

ders who cannot afford treatment and to
diminish the societal obsession with body
image that fuels many eating disorders.
Roserfrnan and Saffran met while un-
dergoingitreatment for eating disorders.

Once they completed their treatments,
they wanted to help other people with
similar issues. . -

“It grew out of everything that Kristina _

[Saffran] and I wanted when going through
treatment,” Rosenman said. “We saw many
issues and heard of people who wanted
treatment, but were turned away.”

Rosenman founded the project because
many people struggling with eating disor-
ders cannot undergo treatment for mon-
etary reasons, and the failure to obtain
treatment worsens their disorders.

“I thought it was amazing that they
[Rosenman and Saffran] met in a treat-
ment center and realized a lot of people
need their help,” Majersky said. “I just

ebrate the organizatio n’s ﬁfth anniversary,
at which it raised approximately $60,000.

, “We never had anyone to look up to
during treatment,” Rosenman mentioned.
“Everything we wanted, we’re now pro-
viding.” » ’

Barbara Smolek, the administrative
manager for Columbia Center for Eating
Disorders,’ a Project HEAL partner, said
that she thinks the “mission, efforts and
results [of Project HEAL] are terriﬁc.” She
and the Columbia Center are “proud to
partner and support their work.” A

Project HEAL aims to increase aware-
ness of the potential severity of eating
disorders. _ -

prevalent problem

zation based in Illi-
nois that is dedicated
to the prevention and

of butterﬂies around campus.
According to Majersky, the Student Or-

. ganization Resource Center provides funds

for Project HEAL to host events. The group
then donates all of the money it raises to
the national Project’ HEAL organization,
which saves and allocates the money for
treatment scholarships. People with eating
disorders can then apply for scholarships
to help pay for treatments, based on their
ﬁnancial needs. _

The national project raises money by
hosting beneﬁt brunches and fashion
shows and speaking at schools and hos-
pital programs. It most recently hosted
a cocktail party in New York City to cel-

alleviation of eating
disorders.

“Eating disorders are often rooted in
difficult or painful emotions,” Zumm said.
“This might be something that is hard for
[sufferers] to talk about. Let them know
you support them and care about them.”

According to Zumm, other signals of
eating disorders include the avoidance of
eating, excuses for not eating, excessive
exercise, withdrawal from social situations
and frequent trips to the bathroom. Suf-
fere/rs may also hide food or eat in secret.

The most common eating disorders are
anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge
eating disorder and avoidant and restric-
tive food intake disorder. Treatment for

these disorders can range anywhere from
professional assistance to treatment cen-
ters, hospitals and residential programs.

Usually, the national Project HEAL
waits until it has enough money saved up
in scholarship funds before choosing ap-
plicants. In the past ﬁve years, the organi-
zation has provided scholarships to seven
individuals for treatment.

“One of our applicants is now traveling
the world,” Rosenman said. “It amazes me
to think that if Project HEAL didn’t exist,
what would’ve happened to her?”

Project HEAL mostly raises money for .

inpatient and residential treatment, and
according to Waugaman, residential treat-
ment can amount to $20,000.

This month, the Pitt chapter hosted a

Fat Talk Free Week, a national, seven-day,
public-awareness effort to highlight body

' image issues and change people’s focus

from size to health.

The group sold bracelets and offered $5
Zumba and yoga classes. Group members
raised $140 in one week. In its ﬁrst year,
Pitt Project HEAL raised $10 through bake
sales and a “thin” documentary event.

“I’ve heard from members of how some
students on campus love reading our posi-
tive—image things, and it really affects them
in their day,” Waugaman said.

Pitt’s chapter often refers eating dis-
order sufferers to the Counseling Center,
because its members believe proper treat-
ment is key to overcoming the disorders.

“I’ve had some friends that did go away
to treatment for a while and then I saw that
they got better, considering the relapse
rate is really high,” Majersky said.

Majersky and Waugaman mentioned
other factors that might signify an eating
disorder, including preoccupation with

weight and body image, counting calories »

excessively and cutting certain foods out
of one’s diet. _ *

“It almost becomes an obsession,”
Waugaman said. I

Martha ever had contact with the author.

Events attributed to Martha have shocked
skeptics into believing.

Based on an article published in 2005 in
the University Times, a janitor dubious of
Martha’s existence witnessed the sheets of
her bed ﬂy back one night while cleaning
the room.

He is now abeliever.

Bruhns said she recalls her own super-
natural experience during a ghost watch last
year. t ‘

“As I began to reference my grandmother
 the cradle with my baby pillow on it rocked
three times,” she said inan email. “I thought,
at ﬁrst, that Catula, Dracula’s cat, had done
it, buthe was sound asleep.”

Author Melissa Haas’ cat, Catula, will
be in attendance tonight. Haas has written
children’s books featuring her feline that
ﬁctionalize'Dracu1a and his three pets.

Jessica ‘Penot, a blogger, columnist and

author of the “Haunted America” book series 0
retold stories of people’s encounters withvthe

paranormal. V
Through her research, she has discovered
that seeing is believing, to an extent.

“I’ve known a lot of people that very sol- .
idly don’t believe in ghosts and then some-

thin ' happens and they verystrongly believe
in ghosts,” Penot said. “I think it is something
that is hard to believe in until you’ve seen it

with your own eyes, because again, there is .

no way to prove i .” .

Many Pittstudents grapple with this un-
canny idea,‘ since it counters the fact-based,
scientiﬁc material that professors often teach
in class. '

Count junior engineering major Thomas
Tyler as someone who bases his beliefs in
science, but still has an appreciation for the
supernatural. - ’ M — f

‘ “I would say the logical; engineering side
of me says, ‘No, [ghosts] don’t exist,”’ Tyler
said. “But the kid in me says, ‘Oh, I wish they
existed so much —- that’d be so cool.”’

'I‘y1er’s conviction is shared by Bruhns,
who has sworn to have felt her grandmother
Martha’s presence in the Early American
Room on multiple occasions. ’

“Spend an evening alone in the Early
American bedroom as I did years ago,”
Bruhns said. “Some spirit scared the beje-
ezus out of me that night. The skeptic should
be so lucky.” "

E. coli is a large group of bacteria, some
of which cause ‘disease through a toxin
called Shiga toxin. The strain related to
the Oakland incidents, O157:H7, is the most

ing E. coli (STEC) in North America, ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Control.
An estimated 265,000 STEC infections

V After ingesting the bacteria, individuals
endure an incubation period of three to four

To anyone walking along
West 120th Street in Upper
Manhattan, the avenue’s nick-
name, “The Widest Street in the
World,” might appear arbitrary.
But upon noticing the campus of
Columbia University on one side
and Columbia Teacher’s College
on the other, anybody could un-
derstand the superlative.

_The wide division between
the oldest school of education in
the country and the Ivy League
university with whom it shares
a_name is not unique. Schools of
education often occupy academ-
ic orbits far removed from their
universities’ undergraduate and
faculty communities. But if col-

sciences curricula to marketable
skills and if schools of education

and legitimacy, both must col-
laborate to bridge this gap.

At Pitt, the intersection of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard, which divides the
Dietrich School of Arts and Sci-
ences in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and the School of Education
in Posvar Hall, does not feel
quite so wide. Unless, of course,
you’re waiting for the walk sign
to change two minutes before
your class on the third floor of
the Cathedral begins.

Nonetheless, undergradu-
ates in the School of Arts and
Sciences would do well to avail
themselves of the educational
opportunities across the av-
enue, and both institutions
stand to improve through this
collaboration.

In order to accomplish this,

leges want to align their arts and .

want to increase their prestige *

however, universities must chal-
lenge assumptions that run de-
cades deep.

The idea of classes, curricula
and research designed speciﬁ-
cally for prospective educators
did not gain popularity until the
latter half of the 19th-century,
when established universities
sought to expand their scope
by training teachers for the

new public education bureau— .

cracy. By /the early 20th cen-
tury, schools of education had
matured from basic teacher-
credentialing institutions to
the contemporary engines of
the new “science of education”

V —— supporting psychological re-

search and granting advanced
graduate degrees.

For the past century, these
schools have been the gate-
keepers to the educational
profession — preparing not

‘only classroom teachers, but
also administrators and ana-

lysts. What is more, they house
scholars working in every cor-
ner of the field — from cogni-
tive psychologists to historians
and philosophers of education.
Pitt’s School of Education today
awards 50 degrees through 35
distinct programs.
Unfortunately, some of these
schools have not been able to
leave behind their humble ori-
gins as teacher-training schools,
and the exciting research they
conduct and the interdisciplin-
ary classes they facilitate all oc-
cur behind a veil hidden from
curious undergraduates. Those
undergraduates who don’t think
they have an interest in enter-
ing education — or, more likely,
don’t know they have an interest
in education — feel they have

i Disconnect between arts and sciences,
education schools misses opportunities

nothing to gain from lifting the
veil. A

f To some, such an interaction
might seem unnecessary and
fruitless given the structure of
each institution.

Among regional schools of
education, Pitt differs in its pri-
marily graduate-level approach
to teacher-training and other
educational ﬁelds. Its teacher-
certiﬁcation program consists

of a five-yearprogression,

through which students gain a
B.S., in-class experience and a
master’s degree in education.

Though the lack of a four-
year undergraduate degree in
education distinguishes Pitt
from most education schools,
this structure is much more
common among national re-
search universities, according
to Maggie Sikora, the Director
of Admissions and Enrollment
at the School of Education.

Fortunately for undergradu-
ates, such a structure creates
greater space for a’ curious
exploration of educational re-
search. Rather than pigeonhol-
ing students into undergraduate
education tracks by the time
they arrive on campus, this al-
lows students to complete full
degrees in the liberal arts and
sciences-and then progress into
the K-12 classroom.

What is more, this structure
also ensures that prospective
teachers master their content-
areas prior to their pedagogi-
cal experience — something
all too uncommon in American
classrooms today. As of 2011,
29 percent of teachers held a
bachelor’s degree in education

as their highest credential, as opposed 

to 15 percent with a bachelor’s degree in
a non—education ﬁeld.
This trend has engendered consid-

A erable public criticism of mainstream

teacher education in the form of reports
and articles decrying a route to the class-
room that circumvents the content. In
addition, new alternatives to education-

school credentialing —— such as the Teach
for America program, which directly
recruits recent undergraduates — have
gained popularity and public attention.

The accuracy or inaccuracy of these

i criticisms and their alternatives aside,

schools of education are pressed to re-
gain the respect — and trust —— of the"
American public. On the other side of
the avenue, undergraduate colleges are
at pains to demonstrate the financial
feasibility and practical application of
arts and sciences degrees to a public less

inclined to apply.

Pitt’s emphasis on mastering sub-
ject matter as a prerequisite for teacher
training provides an example for other
schools of education to follow, and stu-
dents and administrators in the College
of Arts and Sciences ought to take note
of the opportunities.

If undergraduate departments in the
School of Arts and Sciences would begin
granting credit for coursework in rel-
evant classes in the School of Education,
that would go far to introduce students

to an unfamiliar ﬁeld and, possibly, a
career path. I see no reason why history
students could not receive departmental
credit for enrolling in “History of Edu-
cation” in the School of Education, or
philosophy students in “Contemporary
Philosophy of Education.”

With these policies in place, admin-
istrators can finally disprove the old ad-
age. Those who can do will teach, and
those who can teach will do — and not
just make do. I

Apparently “The Walking Dead” is more
popular than football.

According to the New York Times, the
season—four premiere of the graphic-novel-
tumed—television-sensation garnered 16.1
million viewers, surpassing any NFL game
aired this year.

The American public loves zombies ——
or at least connects with the fear that they
provoke. Through ﬁlms and television, the
zombie has experienced a Renaissance
that has many people wondering why the
fear of a zombie apocalypse is so appeal-
ingénowadays.

American news is riddled with reports
of economic recession and uncertainty.
Unemployment is up, and Americans al-
most witnessed the government default

here at Pitt, does not see the popularity
of zombies and the increase in economic
anxiety as a coincidence.

Horror taps “into our fears and fanta-
sies aboutwhere we are in our own society
and culture and where we would want to
be,” he said. He added that it also plays
off “where we would be terriﬁed to be”
as a society.

Lowenstein sees zombies as “our most
working—class monsters,” considering that
“they’re not very glamorous, they’re dirty,
they’re broken, they’re disgusting and they
don’t have much going for them individu-
ally. But in a mass, they are a terrifying
threat,” he said. i

Lowenstein, the author of the book
“Shocking Representation: Historical
Trauma, National Cinema and the Modern
Horror Film,” postulates that the horror
genre has foralongtime beenadeceivingly
important mediumfor expressing cultural

and historical reactions.

“Horror ﬁlms —- rather than the more
culturally approved—of ﬁlms that directly
address events like the Holocaust, Hiro-
shima, Vietnam — actually have more to
tell us about what it’s like to grapple with
these dramatic, historical events,” he said.

‘ This brings us to another popular
monster nowadays — the Vampire. Dan-
iel Bemardi, the professor and chair of the
cinema department and director of the
Documentary Film Institute at San Fran-
cisco State University, believes that the
vampire, like the zombie, is a character that
can represent a multitude of ideologies.

According to Bemardi, these ideologies
have been manipulated over time. “The
history of the vampire movie moves from
anti—Sernitism and homophobia to some
progressive sort of gay politics to issues of
race,” and eventually “to gender—bending
and sexual expression,” Bemardi said. He
added that vampire ﬁlms act as a “wonder-

fluences horror

ful, historical vehicle for ﬁlmmakers to
place all kinds of contemporary ideas into,
so that the ﬁlms, although they are about
vampires and things that aren’t true, reso-
nate powerfully [and] emotionally with
audiences.” '

The appeal ofvampires is unique, says
Bemardi. “Anythingwith religion becomes

‘ reallypalpable,anythingwithsexbecomes

really palpable, and anything with alien
invaders or supernatural invaders becomes
palpable,” Bemardi said. “And the beauty
about the vampire is that it is all three.”
Lowenstein sees the two monsters’
popularity as representing two sides of
the spectrum. “The vampire is among our
most aristocratic monsters — very glam-
orous, very sexy and often very wealthy,”
while “zombies are low on the economic
ladder,” he said.
Lowenstein discussed the story of Al-

Are sexy halloween costumes
really empowering?

Dylan Abbott
Stag?’ Wrz'ter

As my ﬁrst American Halloween approach-
es, I am struck by the dedication and en-
thusiasm given to this festivity.

Pumpkins have invaded all walks of life.
Fake cobwebs hang in places where fake
cobwebs rarely hang. Comical skulls and
ghosts are decoratively scattered across
homes and shops. I have never before wit-
nessed such commitment to, and money
spent on, what I’d always seen as an eve-
ning of tactical sweet-begging.

But one aspect of this holiday prevalent
both here in the U.S. and in my home coun-
try of Great Britain is the adoption and
consequential obsession with the “sexy”
side of Halloween. More speciﬁcally, the
ability for a number of young women to
transform the most innocuous of charac-
ters or creatures into something far more
sexually explicit. For one thing, I’ve yet to
ﬁnd a hospital where the nurses are wear-
ing stockings and high heels. ‘

The proliferation of scantily-clad me-
dia icons in recent years has undoubtedly
allowed such trends to take off. With TV
ads and music videos constantly capital-
izing on the concept that “sex sells,” it’s no
wonder that such ideas have seeped into
everyday culture.

Yet Halloween also represents an oc-
casion to ignore the stuffy conventions
of clothing and to feel liberated in how
we present ourselves. This said, such ac-
tivities run the risk of provoking backlash
and criticism, most notably in the form
of “slut-shaming” — a trending social
phenomenon that is set on humiliating
those who dress and behave in sexually
aberrant ways.

In the last few months, no one has
personiﬁed this issue more so than Miley
Cyrus. The amount of viliﬁcation her sexu-
alized antics have incurred would suggest
a moral victory on the part of those who
slut—shame. Yet a Google Shopping poll
uncovered that Cyrus was, in fact, the most
popular inspiration for women’s costumes
this Halloween.

Predictably, a number of Miley Cyrus

replicas will be braving the cold come Oct.
31st. Does this indicate, then, that not so
many of us truly despise the controversial
singer? Or is it another form of parody, an
ironic portrayal of the sexually deviant
media culture? _

When speaking with Alicia Williamson,
part of the women’s studies faculty here at

. Pitt, she suggested that perhaps “people

need Halloween to feel ‘authorized’ to ex-
press their sexuality in ways that might not
otherwise be deemed socially acceptable.”

With this in mind, Halloween should
provide us with an insight into the secret
yearnings of how we really want to behave,
but are always too afraid to act out in fear
of judgement. However, taking into con-
sideration the media’s inﬂuence upon our
choices — interestingly Google suggested
that “Breaking Bad” will be the most popu-
lar adult costume overall this year — are
we really expressing an innate desire, or
is it all a ploy for us to spend more money
on the latest trend? Has sexual liberation
merely become another marketable con-
cept that all of us young, impressionable
types will blindly buy into?

Williamson pointed out that Miley
Cyrus’ performance and look was “pro-
duced by a team that successfully upped
her market value.” Consequently, compa-
nies are able to make a hefty proﬁt off her
popularity, especially at this time of year.
This is no surprise, given that a National
Retail Federation survey uncovered that
Americans spent over $2.6 billion on cos-
tumes alone last Halloween. Furthermore,
Williamson went on to explain that this “in—
vites the consumer to buy into something
that produces sexuality as a commodity.”

Here, then, is the issue: The way we
present ourselves sexually has become
less of a reaction to suppressed desires,
but more a way of subscribing to com-
modiﬁed trends.

The debacle that is “slutty” Halloween
costumes presents a certain tension in
opinion. On one side we have the media
and proﬁt-making organizations luring
us into a false sense of “sticking it to the

Clever use of makeup can make Halloween scary again

Jack Trainor
For The Pitt News

What’s wrong with being scary these days?
It seems that once you hit college, Hal-
loween becomes less about being scary and
more about irony or playful jest.
Even with the rise of Halloween attrac-
tions such as Pittsburgh’s Scarehouse and
Hundred Acres Manor, scary costumes

seem to be an afterthought for college‘

students. Perhaps we’ve forgotten since
our trick—or—treating days how to even be
scary on Halloween.

Halloween, at its core, is all about being
scary. Scare venues don’t dress their actors
up in red, plastic Mario jumpsuits or black
cat—ears headbands for a reason.

In fact, making a scary costume is prob-
ably easier than most people think, says
Spencer Dillman, the lead make-up artist
for Pittsburgh’s Hundred Acres Manor.

Thanks to Dillman, Hundred Acres
Manor (not to be confused with the Hun-

HOFBREIUIHAUS

A good, cheap costume can be made with just a little makeup. MCT Campus

dred—Acre Wood) features six frightening
make-up and costume—oriented attrac-
tions.

As a professional, convincingly turn-

ing “a high school cheerleader into an un-
dead, ﬂesh-eating creature from your worst
nightmare is not easy,” says Dillman, “but
application is key.”

Dillman uses special makeup, brushes
and sponges on the actors’ faces to trans-
form them into the nightmares found in-
side the manor. This is a common effect
used by many makeup artists involved in
Halloween—themed attractions. ,

Another venue thgt uses these methods
is Pittsburgh’s famous Scarehouse. There,
critically acclaimed makeup artists Nick
and Brian Wolfe of Evil Twin FX, their own
special—effects company, conduct work-
shops on increasing the fright. They fo-
cus on how to properly use sponges when
applying makeup, which involves a lot of
tedious dabbing movements on the face
in order to be as precise as possible. They
also gave a brief overview of the anatomy of
the skull, which is useful knowledge when
attempting to create a bony zombie face: a

This all sounds like it can be very tech-
nical and time—consuming, but actually

HORROR

fred Hitchcock hiring Stanford researchers to
investigate why “Psycho” was such a popular
ﬁlm. Why then? What did people fear so much
about the story? The research remained in-
conclusive.

There are a multitude of interpretations,
and there may be no clear—cut connection
between why the public is afraid of vampires
and why they are afraid of zombies.

Inanarticle on Cracked.com, S. Peter Davis
discussed the correlation that exists betweena
Republican president andaninﬂux of zombie
movies, and a Democratic president with an
upshot of vampire ﬁlms. And although it is
tempting to think that political climate and
horror genres are indirectly linked, Professor
Lowenstein thinks that there is more going on.

“Whatever our political views are, I think
we come to our horror ﬁlms with avaried set
of needs and desires, and often the political
work that gets done between a ﬁlm and its
audience is not at the level of intention on
the part of the ﬁlm or of the audience,” he
said. “It is something hard to quantify,” and
a “matter of chance and accident on a certain
level,” he added.

Bemardi agrees. Movies involving aliens
and vampires become “the perfect repository
for all the angst that gets built up by the right,”
he said. “But it’s not a literal thing,” he added.

According to Bernardi, the big question
that all ﬁlmmakers have to ask themselves is:
“What are people afraid of right now?” From
there, ﬁlms and television shows have to play
on the fear and anxiety of their audiences, us—
ing allegory, metaphor and special effects to
be convincing and poignant. All of this leads
to a ﬁlm or television showthat is “always
about, thematically, the time in which it was
made,” Bernardi said.

iggéowadays, however,  oftheseonce—
tirﬁély metaphors can fall ﬂatthanks to dated
special effects. - _ - V V

 Patterson, who has worked at the

Manor'Theatre in Squirrel Hill for two years,

said that the “Midnight Manoifishowings of ,

old horror movies tend to—bring-  crowds
of younger patrons who often do not get the

same effect from the ﬁhns that their parents ‘

mayihave received. - T e

"‘I think for the most part, they come 

the camp element,” he said. “They want to
ﬁnd something to laugh at.”

Some ﬁlms seem to age better than others,
depending on the subject matter and the ef-
fectiveness of metaphors.

Regardless of the ambiguity, Lowenstein
believes that the horror genre remains a vi-
able medium for cultural expression. “My
conviction is that the horror ﬁlm does have
important things to teach us about how we
go about representing these events and how
we go about understanding them,” he said.

MAKEUP

when it comes to makeup, insists Dillman.
Focusing on ﬂesh tones, speciﬁcally reds
and purples, is an effective and easy way to
transform your greasy pimples into scary
ﬂesh wounds.

Red eyeliner is another commonly un-
derestimated tool available to the common
person and used by professionals such as
Dillman. Red eyeliner “will instantly make
you look sick and diseased,” he says.

Another makeup myth is that “you need
to be willing to spend hundreds of dollars
to create a proper makeup look for Hallow-
een,” Dillman explains, “which is certainly
not the case.” With a mere $20 budget, you
won’t have to rely on cop—outs like “black
cat” or “’80s guy” for_your costume.

For $20 or less, you can get two quality
eye shadow colors (remember to stick with
those organic tones), some red eyeliner,
a bottle of fake blood and a tiny bottle of

liquid latex in any color you can ﬁnd. All
of these items are not only cheap, but also
can potentially be found at the closest con-
venience store, which requires much less
effort than taking a bus over to a South Side
costume shop.

Now be sure to use these materials wise~
ly. Just because you have them does not
mean you are automatically scary. “Don’t
just slap some blood on yourself,” advises
Dillman. “Use fake blood as an added detail,
not a cover up.”

Some other things to avoid are pros-
thetic pieces made for generic face shapes.
Not only are these unoriginal and diﬂicult
to work with, Dillman says, but also a lot of
ﬁrst—timers just end up throwing them away.

If Thursday comes around and you still
haven’t gotten a costume, don’t spend your
money on black spandex, itchy Afros or
plastic Kanye West glasses. Looking scary
isn’t only cheap and easy — it’s what Hal—
loween’s all about. I

The A&E staff picks the four most essental horror films

The Pitt News A&E Staff

This week, the Pitt News A&E staff
sealed themselves in their clandestine
war room located somewhere beneath
the Allegheny River and spent countless
hours screaming at each other, chugging
Cherikee Red and coming dangerously
close to asphyxiating due to a lack of
ventilation. The goal was to answer one
of life’s eternal questions: What is the
greatest horror film of all time? They
tragically failed in their quest. However,
they did come up with a top four and have
decided to put them up to a vote on the
Pitt News website.

By Shawn Cooke

“Psycho”

Director: Alfred Hitchcock

While many remember “Psycho” for
the ridiculously-iconic shower scene
(there’s even a commercial parody with
pistachios), the film’s real inﬂuence lies
in setting a new bar for shock value in

ﬁlm — without showing half of modern
horror’s blood and gore. We don’t need
to see the knife hit ﬂesh to be terrified.
“Psycho” isn’t staged much differently
than the average Hitchcock mystery, yet
it contains a blood-curdling score and
three major shock moments that elevate
it to horror status. I
Powered by a terrific turn from An-
thony Perkins, “Psycho” cements Nor-
man Bates as one of the most complex,
charismatic, and sympathetic “villains”

of all time. Trademark Hitchcock mVisdi- .
rection jerks the narrative around by fre—'

quently substituting protagonists. When
all is said and done, we don’t know who
we should have been rooting for — an
extremely daring approach for a horror
film. While the left-turn of a ﬁnal scene
may prevent it from being perfect, you
still can’t beat “Psycho’s” inﬂuence and
sheer visceral shock.

What’s more, the ﬁlm achieves in-

leased in 1973. In terms of visceral thrills
and genuine shock, few other horror
ﬁlms even compare to the nerve—twisting
intensity of this film’s most essential
scenes.

“The Exorcist” is so effective because
it focuses on the role that evil and wick-
edness play in the existential scheme
of our world, rather than splattering as
much blood as possible. Additionally,
the ﬁlm set precedents for many ele—
ments — head—turning, projectile vom-
iting and spider—walking — that have
become terrifying staples of horror and
have spurred cheap imitators ever since.
Dramatically satisfying, emotionally in-
volving, brilliantly acted and featuring
astonishingly realistic special effects
and makeup —— not to mention a num—
ber of iconic shots and scenes — “The
Exorcist” is not only one of the greatest
horror ﬁlms, but simply great ﬁlmmak-

Three stories to watch entering 20

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The 2013-2014 NBA season officially
opened Tuesday night, although many in
Pittsburgh were unaware. LeBron James
and the Miami Heat re-asserted their domi-
nance after winning last season’s NBA Fi-
nals while ruining Derrick Rose’s return
to the Chicago Bulls, and the Los Angeles
Lakers’ band of cast—offs spoiled Doc Riv-

ers’ debut as head coach of the Los Angeles ‘ 1

Clippers.

For those who intend to pay attention
this NBA season amid the media clamorof
Pitt hoops, Pitt football, Penguins hockey

and Steelers ineptitude, here are a few sto- ‘

rylines ranging from the obvious and ob-
scure to one with a hometown connection.
Can anyone knock off the Miami
Heat? :  . . . 1 I ’
‘ The ﬁrst half of this question essentially

makes the second half irrelevant. As many:
analysts say, the Heat are the best team in ‘

the league and will be until another team
proves otherwise.

Miami begins the year in the hunt to
become the ﬁrst team to ‘,‘three-peat” since
the 2000-2002 Lakers dynasty spearhead-
ed by Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant.
The Lakers that won back-to-back cham-
pionships in 2009-2010 are the only squad

that had the opportunity until now.

As far as rosters go, Miami returns not
only its “big three” ofjames, Dwyane Wade
and Chris Bosh, but also most of the key role
players from the last two years, including
Mario Chalmers, Shane Battier, Udonis

 

Haslem and all-time 3-point leader Ray
Allen. ,

The only loss of marginal size was Mike
Miller, who was let go via the NBA’s am-
nesty clause, creating cap space for general
manager Pat Riley to bring in 2007 No. 1

13-2014 NBA season

overall pick Greg Oden and 2008 No. 2
choice Michael Beasley. Although they were
both labeled busts early in their careers, a

1 winning atmosphere and the coaching of

Erik Spoelstra might coax some produc-

_ tions out of the two.

But not that the Heat need it —— they still
have a player building a resume as one of
the best to ever play. Any reason to expect
the Heat not to make a run at the three-
peat falls short at the feet of four—time MVP
LeBronJames.

What team makes _a surprise playoff
run?

For the last two seasons, the Min-
nesota Timberwolves have been a team
many people, myself included, expected
to make a run at the playoffs. But injuries
have derailed the team’s chances the past
two seasons, as well.

For the sake of ‘originality — though
people should pay attention to Minnesota
-— look to the team closest to the Pittsburgh

1 area as one to surprise many around the

league: the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Last season’s Cavs team showed promise
of what the near future holds as Kyrie Irving
armounced himself to the world while Dion
Waiters paired with him in the backcourt

WOMENS SOCCER

Panthers look for ﬁrst ACC Win in ﬁnal regular season game

Andrew Stern
Staff Writer

Pitt women’s soccer plays its final game
of the season tonight» in College Park,
Md., against the Maryland Terrapins. In
this game, Pitt also finds itself search-
ing for its first point of ACC play.

“We hope to gain some points from
this game,” head coach Greg Miller said.
“We’ve been trying to find a win, a tie,
something. Because this is our last op-

portunity, we certainly want to make
something of it.”

Pitt (4-13-1, 0-12 ACC) enters the
matchup with Maryland (9-9, 5-7 ACC)
off a 6-3 loss to-Duke this past Sun-

day. The Panthers fell behind 6-0 in

the first half, but scored three goals
in the second, which Miller hopes will
create momentum heading into their
next match.

“Coming off the Duke game where.

we didn’t have a good start to the game,

but ended well,” Miller said, “hopefully
we can carry the momentum from the
last game against Duke into this game
against Maryland.”

After finishing last season with an
overall record of 7-10-2 and a 2-6-2 Big
East mark, hopes were high for this
season. Unfortunately for Miller and
the rest of the Panthers, this season,
the team’s first in the ACC, has been
extremely disappointing.

Since starting the season 4-1-1, the

Panthers have lost 12 straight matches
since conference play began in Septem-
ber. In fact, the Panthers have been out-
scored in ACC games by a 35-5 margin.

This season, Maryland has strug-
gled, especially in conference play. Af-
ter starting the season ranked No. 17,,
Maryland is no longer ranked, due to
a murderous stretch of games played
in the ACC.

8 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game. I-Iis

the New Orleans Pelicans, when he posted

For Adams to stay on the ﬂoor this sea-

Miller expects the Terps to be a tough
match for the Panthers, with the Terps
looking to extend their season beyond
this one ﬁnal regular season game.
“Maryland is ﬁghting for a postsea-
son spot, both in the ACC Tournament
and the NCAA Tournament,” Miller said.
“Getting three points against a team

for us.” ,

Thursday’s match is the first between
the conferencefoes but likely the last
for a while,,because Maryland moves
to the Big Ten conference next season.

Thursday’s match will also be the last
time that seniors Dana DelleFemine,
Caroline Keefer, Katie Lippert, Alyssa
Meier and Morgan Sharick will play in
a Panthers uniform.

“It’s a tough situation for [our se-
niors], because they’ve been through
a lot over the course of their careers,”
Miller said.’ “I am sure they would love
to end their careers with a win or a point
in [the ACC].”

[similar to] us is going to be critical

Those seniors are somewhat of an

unintentional casualty of Pitt’s move
to the ACC, as they went from play-
ing against Big East competition to the
highest level of competition collegiate
women’s soccer has to offer.

“Coming into this season, this.was
not the ideal situation for them,” Miller
said."‘I’m sure that they want to go out
and lead this team and be the first class
to get a point or a win in the ACC.”

While earning Pitt’s first point in
ACC soccer would be a positive send-off
for this year’s seniors, relative to the
anguish suffered this season, Maryland
looms large in the way of that goal. For
a Pitt team that’s struggled to score this
year, Maryland has defended well -
only‘11.9 percent of opponent’s shots
have found their target. _

“I know [Maryland] coach [Jona-
than] Morgan is going to have them
extremely prepared and ready for this
match,” Miller said. “It should be a good
battle.” ﬂ
