Tuck Shop Prices Climb

The high cost of living ﬁnally hit Pitt students where it
hurts -worst—in the coﬁee cup.

Along with a number of other price increases for the Tuck
A

Shops and cafeteria, the old be-
tween-class cup of coffee has gone
up to eight cents.

Miss Ruth Cramblett,.head of
the University Food Service, said
she regretfully authorized the in-
creases after a losing struggle last
year with rising food, labor, and
operating costs.

Run on_a self—sustaining plan,
the Tuck Shops must ﬁx prices at
a rate which will allow each item-
to carry itself. ’

In addition to pay raises for the
staff, new equipment purchases,
and the rising food price spiral,
Miss Cramblett _ pointed to the
high silverware turnover as a fac-
tor behind the price boosts. Spoons
disappeared at the rate of 13
dozen a Week last year. And sil-
verware is expensive, as the Food
Service purchase lists show.

Other increases listed were
milk, boosted from eight ‘ to 10
cents, tea, eight cents, salads,.20
cents, and five cent increases in
some sandwiches. No reduction
has been made in the size of serv-
ings, which, Miss Cramblett be-

_ \Vhat-is needed now is a deﬁnite and clearly’ stated athletic
‘policy. And that’s the primary job of the new Athletic Com-
mittee. So far they have11’t said much about it.

Up to "now it iseeins that they’ve been too busy choosing
‘Hagan’s successor to bother about formulating a policyf All
we’ve heard’ is thatthe committee favors a “winning -football

anything to make. them better.

Supposedly _“’.deemphasis’-"vwas the policy.‘ But the de-
emphasis was one of.material,' not schedule. ‘And so, while Pitt
discontinued, or at least toned "down, football recruiting‘, it
continued to play the best teams in the nation.

That isn’t a “policy. That’s confusion. -And such confusion
could have ‘only "one possible result—a string’ of defeats and
loss of grid prestige. i ‘ - A ,

The new. committee was formed to halt that decline. And
simply replacing the Athletic Director won’t do ‘it.’ Until the
committee comes up with something constructivein the way
of an athletic policy. Pitt football will continue to sink and
“winning team” will continue to

be nothing more than -a pious wish.

OH! THOSE PRICES

Welcome back, to the. University boy and girls and, in
case you3haven’t noticed is that cup of coﬁee, going to cost you
eight cents, thank you.‘ Along with a few other items: such as
sandwiches, milk shakes and salads the price "of coffee took
‘quite a jump while yﬂlu were gone.

It seems_ that there are just ‘too many Tuck Shop bums
who fritter away their timebefore, between and often during
classes sipping coffee and making with the polite conversa-
tion. The frittering Miss Cramblett,“ head of the Tuck Shop,
doesn’t mind. But the coffee is costing her money. Hence the
'j”un'1’p; , _s

‘\Ve’d seethe about the whole thing except that we know
from long experience that it won’t do any good. It seems that
‘each time” the Tuck‘ Shop raises its prices the students com-
-plain and Student Congress investigates. All to noavail. There
— always seems to be a good reason why‘ prices should go up.

The last raise was due, if we recallito the weekly disap-
pearance of some 13 dozen spoons from the Tuck Shop. Whether
it’s vanishing silverware or coﬁeesippers the result-isthe same.

1 It has gotten to the.point where a person has got to be pretty
well heeled before he can order his food at school.

At any event it does look odd when a non-proﬁt outﬁt.

like the Tuck Shop must charge prices equal ‘to, and in some
cases higher than, those of commercial lunchrooms.

It used to be that a student went into the Tuck Shop with
his money in his hands and carried his food away on a tray.
If prices keep going up the students will soon betaking their
money in on trays and carrying the food away in their hands.

Be careful, Pitt students, or

there has been’ entirely too much
sensible conduct  diligent
study. around here for the past
few years, ‘and -that presents a-

sized.
Several memebrs of Men’s
Council, recognizing this need,

devoted discussion in their ﬁnal
Spring session to the prospects
of reviving the “hazing” practices

green beanie caps, which, by the
way, wa_s the speciﬁc suggestion

That’s a bad. sign.’ 0

since the beginning of the in- ‘social rules shall present a petition ‘at least ten days before the

been acting like people ‘who _are
out to get an -education. Now,
some of them are going to’ act
like people who are“out' to‘ look
like collegians. - . ._
Perhapslit goes back to the no-
tion that there is nothing so happy,

that sort of thing. Well, pardon
the lack here of college spirit and
sartorial good taste, but Pitt needs
more of the type that enrolls ‘for
a course in calculus, not ‘for a
fashion show.

Maybe that preference sounds

a little stuffy; as though it _-comes _.

from a school‘ of thought that in-

urday night. _ .
Respecfabilify Up—

But regardless of how it’ sounds,
the fact is that the serious, well-
intentioned "manner of veterans-
and, ' incidentally, the non-veter-
ans who fell in- with_ that pattern
—has upped the respectability -of
colleges and universities all over
the country. 2

Men’s Council, if it wants to
preserve that respectability, will
do well to stay out of the haber-
dashery line. T. w. Biddle, dean
of men, has himself said that he
doubts whether hazing couldeven
be enforced in a school as large
as Pitt. ‘And I have-Fa suspicion
that there would be a number of
freshmen who .would not relish
wearing that silly little hat and.
being called ,“freshie.” _
Admission ofﬁbsurdify

The very factﬁthat such col-
lege customs were for several
years sidetracked as a courtesy to
veterans-is an admission that those
practices would have created a
situation too absurd to force on
persons of reasonable maturity
and good sense. A revival of them
would amount to 1the- labeling of
non-veteran students as ridiculous
tots. -

From Summer
Tour Abroad

Chocked full -of a Norwegian-

culture, -Miss Helen Poole Rush,,- ‘

deantof women, recently returned
to her desk after a ten-week tour
of that Scandinavian nation.

"By boat, pony cart, bus and
train ?Miss Rush‘ traveled to the

_ [metropolitan areas of Stavanger, I’

Bergen, and Oslo in Norway.

i More numerous, though, were ex;-«

cursions ‘to the small rural towns
which she
beautiful because of their agrari-
an culture. - i
_ ‘Ten’ days of the ten".-weektour
werieil spent in :Sweden, where’
Miss Rush visited with the Ameri-
can Consul. I 1 V
"In G, Norway, such notables as
the_American Ambassador, a J us-
tice of the Courtaof Norway, and
the head‘ of a metropolitan hos-
pital entertained her. -Architects,
writers, ‘psychologists, and teach-
ers. also were among‘ persons who
_met Pitt’s dean of women.
Summarizingi her ten -week
stay, Miss Rush said, f‘I was "most
impressed by the unimaginable
beauty‘ of the country, and the
-‘ overwhelming courtesy and hos-
pitality of the people.”
, As_an_ educator, Miss Rush was
naturally observant of the life of
university students. Norwegian
scholars, she‘ noted, live a life
far different from that of Ameri-
can students. The plan of life for‘
fouryears in a university gives
the Norwegian student a strictly

-academic perspective. Miss Rush

was_surprised to learn that extra-
éiurricularsi are unknown. A
Food“ in Norway, especially in

' the -large cities, still presents a
problem to the Norwegians, Miss"
Rush" reports. -Most rarely seen are
_f_ruits, meatsand eggs. However,

 such shortages-have led to a bet-

_ter_ utilization’ of the many sea-
foodsf nature supplies the nation,
the dean observed.

Recess Appointments

‘EC

In spite of vacation, Student
- Congress kept on the job through-
out the summer, drawing up plans
for next year ‘and ﬁlling vacancies
within its jurisdiction.

Foremost among its recess ap-
pointments was the naming of
Miss Pat Seger to Congress itself.
She was chosen as one of two
Senior women’s representatives
succeeding Miss Eugenia Captain,
who resigned because of ill health.
Miss Seger, named a Junior

class officer’ and a member of
WSGA Commission, During her
junior year she was treasurer of
WSGA. Last spring she. was
placed on Senior Court and WSGA
Executive Commission. She re-
signed both positions to accept the

, Congress post.

Congress also appointed Ray
_Pluskey, leader of the Pitt Inde-
pendent Association, as Student

Congress representative on the»

Publications Board. He is the ﬁrst
non-Congress member in many
years to hold that job.

Plusky succeeds. Stuart Work-

master, Congress member, who

stepped down from the Board to
take over as ‘‘ Business Manager
of the Panther.

Other appointments include the

Worthy last May, has served as a

PAT SEGIIR

man of the Pitt Chest Drive, Stu
Workniaster as head of the Con-
gress Social Committee, and Bev-

erly Snyder as Soph Hop Chair-

man.

Anxious to take advantage’ of
draft deferments and. other ad-
vantages offered by the govern-
ment to most ROTC students, sev-

’ eral hundred undergraduates have

signed up for the basic military

. science course prior to the start of

formal fall registration.

Veterans who have had not less
than six months, active service in
the armed forces may waive the

‘ﬁrst year of the basic ROTC,
course and those who served in,

the armed forces for _at least -one
year may enter advanced ROTC
directly, provided they.meet' the
other requirements. ‘

Colonel Hincke made public a

joint Army and Air Force ‘release.

aimed at clarifying the many er-
roneous statements and rumors
concerning the ROTC’s place in
the Selective Service‘ program.
The oﬁicial bulletin gives the fol-
lowing information.

All students falling within the
18 to 26, year group are obliged to
register with- their local draft
boards. ._

Deferment from the possibility
of call to active military service,

under certain circumstances and‘

conditions, will be in force until
after the completionof the normal
academic and ROTC 7course. With-
in the limits ‘of the, enrollment
quotas of the 231 colleges and uni-
versities in the ROTC program,
the deferment policies will apply
to selectedyROTC~students in both
the basic‘ and advanced courses,
according to the official release.
In order to keep the number of
students certiﬁed for "deferment
within the quotas and to assure
selection of the best qualiﬁed offi-
cer material, the progress of in-
dividuals will be closely observed.

Sets Rules for D erermen-lei-in

 

:'~ /
/-«:f‘;.’,.,_

  

‘<;.

T":

To be eligible for deferment ROTC
students must remain in good
standing ‘in both academic and
military work, must demonstrate
sufficient aptitude and leadership

characteristics to ultimately qual-
ify for a commission, and must
attend camp if so ordered.

Students‘ enrolled, in the Ad-
vanced course prior to the enact-
ment of the draft law (June 24,
1948) and who remain in good
standing throughout the remainder
of their academic and military
course will be automatically de-
ferred. .

A new feature of the program,
as announced by the Army and
Air Force, is the requirement that
in..order to be eligible for defer-
ment students enrolling in ROTC
units must agree to accept a com-
mission and to serve not less than
two years on active duty as an

officer, if called by the secretary-

of the service in which they have
been commissioned.’

According to a United Press dis-
pfztch from Washington, the Army
announced on September 4 that it
had ordered 700 recent ROTC

graduates (-all of them reserve

secondlieutenants) to 21 months
active duty, ‘most of--them report-
ing about Oct. 1. None of the men
called have had 90 days prior ac-
tive service, the Army dispatch
stated.-

 

‘:._,_'  x.'_ "

Students who enrolled in ROTC. ‘T
prior to June 24, 1948- were re-.:
quired only to accept a commis-_ 9‘
sion, if ordered. No agreement to’ _'
serve on active duty‘ was required
prior to that date, as a condition
of enrollment. -'

vi

Those ROTC students who have ‘_
had less than 90 days active ser'v-*5;
ice, if tendered a commission, will_ 
be subject to 21 months active-'f,='j,:
service as ofﬁcers when called ’t'o’~ 15

Revamped and Expanded IM
Program Slated by

A greatly revamped intramural athletic program, one that will
dwarf -the agendas of past years, will be placed at the disposal of.

 

The program, according to Assistant Intramurals Director Leo C.
Bemis, Willbe placed under the management of the students them-
selves, and will includea wider-variety of sports than was offered
‘in the past. ' '

atures of the new card, provided

the City approves the installation of lights at Ellsworth.

Plans formulated by the IM ofﬁce call for a student Intramural

Council to head up, the program.<‘r‘

Subordinate to the Council will
be a Managers association com-
posed of the ‘managers of every
team.

Thenew intramural set-up will
be rounded out by a Protest board
and an Ofﬁcials association.

New sports to be added to the

ball (at Ellsworth Field), tennis,
soccer, cross-country, rifle, shoot-
ing, and horseshoes.

Bemis said, that greater eﬁorts
would be made to keep students
informed on intramural happen-
ings. An intramural handbook is

in the process of publication at
this moment.

An intramurals bulletin board
will be hung in a small alcove "to
the left of the Student desk on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral. It
will show all pertinent notices and
schedules.

B e mi s further envisions a
mimeographed publication.

Another stimulant to student
participation in IM sports is the
organization of a Pitt chapterof
Sigma Delta Psi, national athletic
fraternity. Its members will come
from the cream’ of Pitt’s athletic
crop, varsity and intramural.

Pitt’s Panthers are back.,,_in;;éi
Pittsburgh after a t.\vo-jveelgg.
stay at a picturesque BedfQ’r_d“‘
Springs resort. _ pf ,

But they weren’t there ‘foig-«
their health. . - 

Only the middle Sunday 0,
the 14-day period was observedaaf ~
a day of rest as the squad
through intensive football  ,_‘S“7
for the coming nine-game  -
paign. Even" on Labor Day, con. ,
-trary to custom, they labored.‘-pi :1}.

They got little respite when..'th"e'
returned. After taking the mo
ing off to. register, the ‘Panth_
yesterday afternoon r esurfie‘
twice-daily workouts at the 
tice field beside the athletic offic
on “the hill.” _ ‘ __ 1.

Except for assorted bruisés,.e,
strains, and sprains, the squad er~ij:o;:~:
tered the second half of their p1€e-'_- _‘
season training in good physicals:
condition, well-grounded in single,"
wing play, and with only a ‘_‘Bi”g;.g
TWo,” Southern Methodist and‘
Notre Dame, to lead off aga_i_ns_ii~'A
instead of Illinois, the Irish, an_d_j
Michigan in that order. 

Particularly evident at‘
ford Springs was the ferocity 
which the players battled ea
others for positions. . " >

The ﬁrst team has its ﬁxtures 6:
in several places. But the boys ’g_r;_, E
down the line are giving them’lit'-‘L
tle chance to coast. --;

. Bill Abraham, who at this ti,rn"e...~
last year was getting ‘around’__on‘-;j'
crutches, appears set in the;f_ull'-
back spot. At the moment, Junior ,
Bob Becker is his replacement.

The halfback assignments are;
far from settled. V . 

Veterans Tony DiMatteo fand .
“General” Bobby Lee have‘ been:-
alternating at left" half; Lee ,too_k,._
temporary possession of the ‘post.

wing-back berth.
-Big Walt Cummins, a standout
defensive player last fall, should
hold his quarteback post. His clos-

est competition is coming ‘from

tough Lou Melillo, a jayvee PTO“

duct.

.,.The most promising man up

-from Charles‘ (Doc) HartWig’S’ '47
frosh squad is rugged ‘Nick Bol-

kovac, 210-poung Youngstown
gridder. The blond giant ‘may
team with Bob Plotz_, two-year
letterman, at tackle. Mentioned as
“the most improved player on
squad,” Sam Haddad has
moved up with Ray Johnson be-
hind them.

Once again Bill McPeak and
Leo Skladany, senior ends, pace
the ﬁeld of terminals.

Nick DeRosa, by virtue of his

pass-catching, and Frank Capel-

lo, the Ellwood City man who
saw considerable relief service
last year, follow along with trans-

planted Earl Sumpter and tall Ted.

Geremsky.

With “the Rock,” Kulpmont’s

"Bernie Barkouskie, on the side-'
lines the second week of practice,
_the guard struggle became partic-

ularly bitter.

Mike Boldin, moved over from
guard, wasn’t far ahead of Andy
Kisiday, . Tony hRazzano, Ralph
Coleman, or Charley Thomas, all
veter ans . Sophomores Flint

-Greene, Charles Yost, and Laurice
»Pi'erce, are making bids, too.

Having started‘ ‘every game last

‘year, Len Radnor appears to hold, V
. the same rank now. But, with Lee

Ward temporarily shelved, new-

comers George Radosevich and"

George Steingraber are pressing
the “Plymouth Rock,” as is Don

, Fisher. I

As they head toward the lid-
lifter against the Southwest Con-
ference champions on September
25, the Panthers seem to have in
mind turning the ’47 nightmare
into pleasant dreams.

freshman squad this fall, Head
Coach Walter S. (Mike) Milligan
revealed today.

They’ succeed Charles (Doc)
Hartwig who has been moved to
an administrative position.

Both ‘Schmitt and Shedlosky

collegiate service. After three
years on’ the Panther varsity, the
last as a regular on the undefeat-
ed 1937 squad, Schmitt played

delphia Eagles.. -
' ~ He has had several other coach-
ing assignments since then. He,

. along with Dr. Jess Quatse for a

few days, worked _”with varsity
tackles at Bedford Springs.
Shedlosky, brother of lLeon
Shedlosky, former Pitt halfback,
is taking time off from his dental
studies for coaching backs.
spent two years at Tulsa under
iMilligan and Head Coach Henry
Frnka.

gin the ﬁrst day of school, Sep-
tember 20, Milligan also an-
nounced. He expects more can-
didates ‘ this year, but said,
“There’ll still be not as many as
we’d like.” . .
Prominently listed among the
candidates, who will report to

Brennan and Bob Bestwick and
End Chris Warriner, ‘outstanding
district high‘ school gridders last
year.

Workouts will be staged on the
Ellsworth Center gridiron.
ganization will be taken care of
prior to the opening of actual
drills. Again this year, the frosh
will see no intercollegiate compe-
tition.

Two questions always thrown at anyone associated with.
Pitt football are: ‘.‘How does Pitt look?” and “\Vhat are they
going to do this year.” ‘ .

Tough ones. to‘ answer with any degree of accuracy.

Still they- can be answered. ' ' I

Quickly listing several things to their advantage this fall
serves as the best reply. - ' _

"" " " The schedule is deﬁnitely lighter; the
team, practically to” the man is now thoroughly
E familiar with the single-wing, something they
A weren’t last fall; as of now the Pitts have not
, lost a. key man with aserious injury or had -a
 promising triple-threat back lifted n1y3ster-
1 iously from the camp.

1 Tough opponents are betterspaced on the
1 schedule, with Southern Methodist and Notre
. Dame startingit OE and Purdue and Penn
, State winding up the campaign. ..

. Finally the squad at camp appeared to hav

4 a warmer spark of spirit than when they closed

shop at Arandale last September.

Sidelighfs on ‘Camp ‘

Bill Hardisty, Pitt’s golden toe, has a "habit of undeI‘.es-
timating his kicking ability. A kicker shouts tohis 1inemen__
moving downﬁeld under the boot where the ball is headed.
Hardisty, when he would cut ‘loose with a 50-yard punt, ‘yelled,

“Down the middle. SHORT.” . . . Bobby Lee looks like
hes’ ready to move well for the Panthers this year. At one
punt-runback scrimmage at camp he took the ﬁrst kick back
for a TD, then repeated on the third, on a reverse from Bill
Bruno . . . Over a radio in a hotel, in the’ Pitt section came
the Notre ‘Dame victory song, immediately followed by a
scream “This is treason.” . . . Val Castrodale, head manager,
was voted the man most liked to be strangled. His fog~horn_

   

Hardisty

voice blasted everybody out of bed in the morning.
