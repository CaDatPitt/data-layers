Facilities, Aid
Act Introduced
In U.S. Senate

A College Academic Facilities
and Assistance Act bill was in-,
troduced to the U.S. Senate Octo-
ber 11. ~

The bill would authorize allot-
ments to the states of $180,000,000
each year, for ﬁve years. _The
grants would go to institutions of
higher education for the construc-
tion of classrooms, libraries, and
laboratories. '

It would also‘be used for facili-
ties for research or for the ad-
ministration of educational or re-
search programs. .

, Also Authorize

The Senate bill would also au-
thorize an appropriation of $120,-
000,000 for 1963 and for each of
the four succeeding years for
loans to colleges and universities.
The loans would be used for the
construction of academic facili-
ties.

A third portion of the bill
would authorize large appropri-
ations for student loans. No loan
to a student could be more than
$1000 for an academic year.
Also, up to 50% of the repay-
ment could be cancelled if the
recipient were in the upper 25%
of his class.

An appropriation of $50,000,000
for each of the next ﬁve years for
aid to public community colleges
is also included. This would be for
the construction of libraries; na-
tural or physical sciences or en-
ginieering research centers; and

I The Graduate School of Public and International Affairs,
and the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary have set up a joint
program whereby students from one educational institution

can earn credits-at the other.

$500 in Cash,

Pledges, Given
To Pitt Chest

The ﬁrst week of the Pitt Chest
campaign netted about $500 for
the different charities which the

this was collected at the Powder
Puff football game. /\

About * $200 was collected in
cash and approximately $300 was
pledged, according to Jerry Clay,
Treasurer of Pitt Chest.

The ﬁrst ‘part of the campaign
consisted of contacting the num-
bers of the different organizations
on campus at their weekly meet-
ings. Letters -'will- go out today
to nearly 6000 students who have
not yet been contacted in hopes
that they will contibute to the
drive.

The money will go to ﬁve char-
ities, the United "Fund. of Alle-
gheny County, the Negro Scholar-
ship Fund, the World University
Service, the Men’s Loan Fund,

and the Women’s Loan Fund.

“Cross-c u l t u r a 1 experiences,
shared with foreign students en-
rolled at the University, would
obviously enrich the education of
anyone’ in the.Semina’ry’s Bach-
elor of. Divinity program,” Dean
Stone said.

In Exchange _

In exchange, Dean Jackson said,
“University students will become
involved in a signiﬁcant dialogue
between faith and culture.”

Dean Stone hopes for further
progress along the same lines. “We
would also welcome experienced
and qualiﬁed persons who would
enroll as regular students in
GSPIA. While these persons
would be subject to our academic
control and would receive their
masters’ degrees from the Uni-

versity, their individual programs
could be worked out jointly with

"the Seminary,” Dean Stone noted.

“Speech and personality,”
said Dr. William Tacey, pro-
fessor of speech and humani-
ties, “are inseparable. As one
speaks, he always reveals his
personality and in order to

speak he must use all of his per-
sonal qualities,” he explained.

Of Speech, Personality

Dr. Tacey has investigated evo— ,

lution of speech for many years.
He claims that as many as 2000
years ago. Aristotle laid down cer-
tain principles of speech. Since
then many people have made an
intellectual study of speech.

The latter half of the 19th cen— I

tury and the early part of the
20th century were called the elo-
cuition period. During this time
the study of public speech went
into a sharp decline.
Great Change

A great change occurred in 1950.
This change was characterized in
the book, Public Speech, by
Winans. The Cornell professor
had studied speech in the light
of a psychological background.
Thisled to the present attitude
that speech and personality are
tightly intertwined. .

Dr. Tacey reports that the
University's speech department
concentrates as much on what a
person says as on how he says
it. This, the staff believes, is
the best way to facilitate the
understanding of an audience.
Students are encouraged to use
both physical and mental pow-
ers to transmit ideas to their
‘listeners.

“The speech department en-

" courages its majors to take psy-

chology courses," said Dr. Tacey.
There is also a special general
studies course on speech and per-
sonality otfered on Thursday
nights during the fall and winter
trimesters. This is a nine credit
course which lasts 10 weeks.
Dr. Tacey spoke on the sub-
Sect of speech and personality to
the National Secretaries Associa-

, tion, Western Reserve Chapter, in

Warren, Ohio last May 5. On No-
vember 24 he will discuss the
same topic for the Highland Chap-
ter of the Association at Hotel
Webster Hall.

SUB Sets To1¢.r

A tour of the H. J. Heinz Com-
pany has been planned for No-
vember 29, according to Dave
Helsel, chairman of the Student
Union Recreation Committee.

sued free on a first come first
served basis. They ca. be picked

A bus will leave the SU at 1:15
p.m. on the 29th and the tour is

‘scheduled to begin at 2:15 p.m.
The return trip will be at 4 p.m.
-The program will include a mo-
vie, discussion, and refreshments.

The tour is part of a series of
programs which the recreation
committee is considering, accord-
ing to Helsel.

Few sights in all the world of girl watching are as breathtak-

with a beautiful form, and the two are cast in one mould,
that will be the fairest of sights to him who has the eye to
contemplate the vision.”

Although the Gym-Dandy is a joy to behold even while

By NANCY FUCHS
At a time when the world.
is constanﬁy shrinking and
international relations more
important, the role of the

Graduate School of Public

and ‘International A f f a i r s,
GSPIA for~short, becomes greater.
GSPIA had its humble be-

" ginning ﬁve years ago, when, ac-

cording to Dean Donald C. Stone,
the University provided him- with
a “beachhead of two rooms in
Bruce Hall, a secretary’, and three
staff assistants.” The only faculty
was that of the existing Institute
of Local Government which be-
came part of GSPIA.

In the ﬁrst year, GSPIA en-
rolled 161 graduate students from
17 countries in some aspect of its
program. Last year there‘ were

some 300 students from over 35-

countries. Approximately 50 per
cent are foreign students. “In ten
years we plan to triple the num-
ber of regular degree students,
with urban renewal the major
area of expansion,” Dean Stone
stated. _
According to Secretary
According to Louis B. McCagg,
secretary of GSPIA, “GSPIA was
founded to meet the pressing de-

‘ mand for public leadership in to-

day’s .world by preparing people
for public service in organizations
ranging from the United Nations
to the smallest unit of local gov-
ernment.” -'

To achievelthis goal, GSPIA
has four ﬁelds of concentration:
General r Public Administration,
Administration of International‘
Affairs, Economic and Social-
Development and "Municipal-

Metropolitan Affairs.

The .uniqueness ‘of GSPIA,

which causes Dean Stone to say,

“There is no school quite like

this,” lies in its three I’s —— inter-.

cultural, interdisciplinary and in-
terprofessional.

By its international student
body and a faculty, all, of which
has had foreign experience,

GSPIA provides an. intercultural
atmosphere. It uses a comparative
educational ‘approach — a com-
parison of different governments
and their methods of problem
Solving.
Not Limited
In regard to the school's inter-
disciplinary nature, McCagg says,
“We don’t limit ourselves to one
ﬁeld like public health or law, but
draw from other resources, among
which are political science, educa-
tion, business, and social work.”~
As to GSPIA’s interprofes-_
sional aspect, Dean Stone notes,
“We put great emphasis on per-
sons with other professional de-
grees in .such ﬁelds" as public
health and engineering.” '
According to Jamil Elias J reisat,
a Jordanian who is studying for
his masters in General Public*Ad-
ministration, “The. international
comparative studies are ‘wonder-

, ful. It is good to be able to study

other" systems. I am very much
satisﬁed with the wide varietygof
courses we can take, but I wish
there were some courses directly

related to customs ‘work.’' /

In regard to socializing with
otherstudents, Jreisat says, “I get
many invitations, but I don’t have
much time to go."

American Studying
B. Kurt Ludwig, an American

‘ .» studying toward his masters in in-

ternational affairs, feels “pleased

with certain aspects of the School

i—— the faculty, general approach

and philosophy, especially the in-
terdisciplinary curriculum.” “The
assignments are so heavy that I
don’t have much of an opportun-
ity for out-of-class Contact with
-other students,” Ludwig notes.
Ehsan Gran, from Afghanis-
tan, is a student in General
Public Administration. He feels
his courses are “very useful be-
cause they give us a broad
background in how to be a suc-

 

cessful executive and orient us

in methods by which we can
recognize our problems and try
to solve them.”

Louise Bell, a former editorial
assistant for Vogue, became in-
terested in urban affairs while
working for GSPIA. As the ﬁrst
woman to go through the urban
renewal program, Miss Bell says,
“The program is a fabulous one
for women. Many women simply
don’t know the opportunity
exists.”

* "De||er Review

.9 Called Erroneous

(Editor, The Pitt News

_'On November 5 you printed a
review of the joint concert of
Alfred Deller, Desmond Dupre,
and the Anuqua ‘Players. It
—'contained errors that should be
_ ‘corrected. ,

 The reviewer evidently went
~ to the concert expecting to hear
“folk songs” performed by a
“folk singer”; this then is what
she heard. The fact that the pro-
‘ “gram explicitly attributed each
 piece to a composer (John Dow-
land, William Byrd, Henry Pur-
‘ -"cell, etc.) bore no, weight.

Claudio Monteverdi was not
recognized as a composer; his
 name, set off by quotation
' marks, was listed in the mid-
‘ dle of titles of his compositions.
As for’ folk music, there . was
one and only one example of it
that evening: “Waly, waly,”
which Mr. Deller sang as an en-
core. The review made no men-
tion- of this. ' -

In regard to the] uncompli-
mentary comments on the per-
formance by the Antiqua, Play-
ers, one may mildly observe that
they were unbecoming in a re-
viewer whose musical knowl-
edge is so patently limited.

2  Dorm Chairman

A " Defends Directors

‘Editor, The Pitt News
 ‘Re: “Intramural Athletics Fail
».'I’est Under Close Scrutiny,” The
?'Pitt News, Nov. 12. ‘

As athletic chairman of dor-
mitory .intramura1s, I would be
the first one to admit that there
are deﬁnite problems in intra-
murals, but they are not pri-
marily the fault of the intra-
mural directors as Mr. Smizik’s
article indicated. ‘
' Our dorm loop had more for-

feits~in football than any other
league for various reasons.
First, there was some confusion"
about how the teams would be
notiﬁed of the schedule and this
lead to some early forfeits be-
cause several of the teams were
not aware that they were to
play. But even after the repre-
sentatives from each team were
informed about scheduling, there
were still forfeits.

Now these could not in any
way be blamed on our intra-
mural directors. The teams that
were sufﬁciently interested had
absolutely no trouble ﬁnding out
when they were scheduled. The
forfeits were caused mostly by
a lack of interest in the dormi-
tories. I entered several teams
in good faith, thinking that they
would be responsible enough to
appear when they were sched-
uled, but after being entered,
several of ‘the teams showed no
interest in playing. _ ,

I know. that Mr. McFarlane
scheduled some games as many
as three or four times in an at-
tempt to get the league moving.
Therefore, I feel that the biggest
problem in our league was stu-
dent apathy.

Now agreed, there are other
problems. Thé oiﬁciating is
sometimes inadequate, but this
is not the fault of the two men
assigned to. cover the football
games. The rules which Mr.
Smizik states are unfair, are
perhaps unfortunate, but they
are necessitated by the condi-
tions under which the games are
played. In general, I think that
the problems of our league can

be attributed more to lack of .

interest, transportation difficul-
ties, and the lack of dormitory
rivalries than to problems which
Mr. ‘Smizik stated.

I do behave that there is room
for improvement, but in. most
cases it should begin at the stu-
dent level.

One of the most anxiously-awaited events of
the literary season of this or any year is the publi-
cation of the Pittsburgh Telephone Directory.

The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania
has onceagain written a moving,
tense story of the people of this
great industrial city, naming all
the names and stating all the
facts, Guaranteed to be one of
the most exciting, if not spine-
tingling books of the year, ~Pitts— A_
burgh and Suburban Telephone '3

‘copping the Pulitzer Prize.

The story opens with a direct
foreshadowing of the excitement
the Directory always has in
store. On the inside cover, we see the heading
“Emergencies,” followed ‘by space for the‘ numbers
of -Police, Fire, Ambulance, ‘Doctor, F.B.I., and
Poison Information.’ Not rnincing words, the open-
ing page also includes this/bit of curt dialogue:

 

' Johnny Walker. (p. 750), John Wayne (D-

“Or .dial operator and say: ‘I want to report a I

ﬁre in (town narne),’~ or ‘I ‘want a policeman in
(town name)’.”_
Teasing Author _

After such a, shocking beginning, the author

then teases the reader withsuch mundane items as ;

“How to Dial Calls from Your -. Telephone’’ (if you
don’t know how, reading" this and practicing for a
few hours a day’ should, make you a whiz at phone

. dialing in.a matter of weeks), “How to‘Place Toll

Calls With ‘Your Operator,” the-suggestive1y—titled

-chapter on. “Business with the: Company,” a some-

what repitious _ chapter on “How to Use Your
Telephone” and then the long-awaited inside story
on “All—-Number‘ Calling: Designed to Meet the
Growth and Challenge of the Space Age.”

At last we get to the heart of the story. The
first scene of the book is A Aardvark Machine and
Tool Company, Inc. The author skillfully weaves

the beginning of a gripping series of exotic locales _

for the action of the story, taking us next to A-Aba
Antiques, A-All Antique Shop, A-Alpha Dress Suit
Company and, ultimately, to the mysterious castle
of Theodore _ Zyzak. Jeepers, I’ve revealed the
ending! "

By Matthew Nesvisky

But the settings of the story are only half the
pleasure of reading the Pittsburgh White Pages.
As usual, the author has included a Tolstoyian
amount of characters in his book, all of equal im-
portance. Throughout 803 pages of Pittsburgh list-
ings and 526 suburban, the .author has craftily in-
troduced many well-known personalities. Among
them are:

John Adams (p. 7), Harry Truman (p. 728),
Robert Welch (p. 764), John F. Kennedy (p. 363),
Thomas Wolfe (p. 514), John L. Sullivan (_p. 702),
758),
Alexander.I-Iamilton (p. 283), Andrew Jackson (p.
334), Jerry Lewis (p. 412) and Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld (p. 417). .

These characters are smoothly woven- into a
story which is mainly concerned with the average-,
every-day people of Pittsburgh. All their trials,

hopes, dreams, vices, crimes, strivings, hungers, de-_

sires, accomplishments, failures, redemptions, tears,
joys, sorrows, fears, neuroses, poverty-— all these
"have been wisely left out of the story. What we are
left with is the names, addresses and telephone
numbers, which, after all, are the really important

_ items in such a work.

'R|Iy'1-himic Flow

The value of the book comes in-the admirable

rhythmic ﬂow of the listings, for which the Bell

Co. is so well-known for, originating. Some critics

-had. feared early. in the seasonthat the substitution ‘

of digits for-the telephone exchange names would
ﬂaw the Directory, but the reader is so swept up
with the immensity’ of the work, the beauty of its
quadruple-columned pages, the grandeur of the
au.thor’s’bold-faced subheads, that such fears. are

easily allayed.

All in -all, the Bell Company is to be commended

L

for its annual contribution to American literature. '

This year’s edition of the Pittsburgh/White Pages

is most highly recommended for two or three" hours ,

of top-notch entertainment and i n t e 1 l e c t u a I
stimulation.

The volume is now available at the Book Center
(-phone booth) or can be located by referring to
the Yellow Pages.

On The Brink of War . . .

Fate of a Nation L

' By Viiay ‘Jain -—----

The drama taking place high up in the Hima-
layan ranges involves the Indian and the Chinese
ﬁghting it out as to who should have a certain

amount of land which is in dispute.

The principal cast of the play however includes
America and "Russia, the twc
most powerful . nations in the
world at present. Just whatrole
they may‘ play in this true life
adventure will be discussed here.

The ideological dispute over
where the border should be was
started about three years ago
when the Chinese announced
that they did not recognize the A
MacMohan line set up by the
British and the Chinese govern-
ment about ﬁfty years ago. Thus
none of the present principals were involved in
that agreement. _

India, following a policy of peaceful settlement
of all disputes, continued to negotiate 'with the
‘Peiping government while the Chinese made con-
tinued advances at intervals between discussions.
Aboutla month ago they shifted their efforts into
top gear. - A

The complacent Indians were thus caught off
guard and had to send an S.O.S. to America to help
them out, which they promptly did. Earlier they
had placed an order for Russian Migs to strengthen
their Air Force, which the Soviets agreed to provide.
Between Two Camps -

Both the Russians and the Americans have been
trying to win over India to their camp, so now the
Russians ﬁnd themselves in a predictment, whether
to side with "their not-too—friendly-ally or with a
neutral whom they want on their side.

The first alternative may alienate the neutral,
perhaps for ever; and the second would cause dis-
sention within the Communist camp and perhaps
further deepen the gap between the two Communist
powers.

To avoid this dilemma, Russia has been unofﬁ-
cially trying to have Peiping cease and desist, and
solve this diﬁerences

ing fai

  

is es.

 

in a'- gentlemanly -way. .
led- in this mission they are at present

      

upon

"~L

whom to support verbally even if no concrete’ help
is given. A
America, on the other hand, had'a relatively

_easy decision to make. They do not like the Chi-

nese and they have an interest to protect in India,
both economic and political. The public opinion
has also shifted in favor of helping India since" the
one stumblingblock inthe ‘relations of the two

countries, V. K. Krishna Menon,/rhe_de'fense min- V .

ister has been ﬁred for mismanagement of his oﬁice.

The problem’ that faces India is a complex one.
They face a ruthless and formidable enemy which
has proven to be too strong for them. They have
been preaching peace for a long time and would
like .-to avoid strife if at all possible, yet all at-
tempts of reaching a.pea'ceful solution have came
to naught. This leaves them with the choice of
either submitting to aggression orstanding up for
their rights.
Lack of Training

The Chinese ‘have had time to train and equip
their forces, while the Indian soldier, though one
of the-’ best in the world, is untrained and ill-
equipped. The arms rushed by the Americans can-
not be used immediately-as the troops have to be
trained ﬁrst. Meanwhile, the Chinese are making

rapid territorial gains and soon there may not be .

anything to salvage.

, A stop has to be put to ‘the invading Chinese
from advancing any further, ‘but just how is the
question. India seems to be debating and trying to
decide whether any of the western powers would
come. to their "aid with more than just arms. now
that the chips are down.

To this point India has maintained diplomatic
relations with Peiping; how long can they continue
to do so in the face of continued harrassment and
mounting pressure has to be decided. As they
ponder upon all these questions the time is running
out.

The Chinese already seem/to have decided their
course of action: to get what they want by any
means that may be necessary to achieve their goal.

What decision the two big powers make, and

what course of action India may decide to embark g

may very yvell decide the fate hot. that nation

Nine seniors will make their last appearance for the

Lions of ‘Penn State Saturday at the Stadium.

The Lions are in with a 7-1 record thus far with their

only loss coming in an upset to Army, 9-6. Although Pitt «

the Panthers. Dlssenslon Runs

The Lions have a diversiﬁed at-

The cause of the team’s troubles

Art Fleischner. “The only reason
he’s doing the coaching is because

«By GIL MCDONALD

COLLEGE PARK, Md. -
Maryland’s soccer squad took
advantage of their greater

the Panthers out of the

Maryland’s ’co-captain Richard

scoring twice to beat the Panthers.
George Shimpeno, Dave Reichen-

bach, and Corky Cuthbert scored _

for the Panthers.

A crowd estimated at 2000 saw
Maryland take the lead when
Tertemez scored after eight min-
utes of the first period. Half a
minute‘ later Simpeno, assisted by
Reichenbach, tallied on a head
ball, and a minute later Reichen-
bach scored when a Maryland
fullback tried a head ball, which
bounced into the goal.

Advance Lead

Cuthbert then increased
lead by driving through the
Maryland backﬁeld. With only a
few seconds leftin the half, Ter-
temez duplicated Cuthbert’s style,
driving through the Panther back-

V ﬁeld and scoring. At halftime the
Panthers led 3-2.

I But, in the second. half, the
Panther squad, [which had, been
well-coordinated ‘with ‘excellent
team play, didn’t fare as well
and the Maryland booters press-
ed their height advantage. I
‘- Roe blasted two head balls, one
in the third quarter and the other
with‘ 2:15 left of the last period,
to give Maryland the victory.
‘‘I wouldn’t be surprised if they
went all the way,” Coach Leo

A Bemis said after the game. Mary-

land will play Springfield College
Louis tomorrow, for the
NCAA semi-ﬁnals. -

The Panthers will return to
Pittsburgh, where they’ll play
their scheduled game with Penn
State Saturday morning. .

PENN S'I‘ATE’S intramural ‘foot-
ball program had only 19 forfeits
in _389 games for a .05 percentage
of forfeits. The fraternity league
went through its second straight
year without a forfeit.

the Panthers will have to come
up with the same type of de-
fense they displayed in their
last ‘three wins against UCLA,
Syracuse and Army.

Regulars playing their last game
for the Panthers will be guards
Ralph Conrad and Tom Brown,
quarterback‘ Jim Traﬁcant and
halfback Ed Clark. Others in their

M 0’Brien Holds Three Game Lead

Nesvisky Remains

Deep in Cellar

Sports Editor Jim O’Brien is
tops. At least in the Yogi race as
it enters its last week. O’Brien
holds a three game lead over Art
Fleischner.

Both had 10-5 records last week.
Fleischner moved ahead of the

'player who had an 8-7 mark and

Bob “Sage” Smizik, last year’s
winner, who was 9-6. After all his
big talk, Smizik will be lucky if
he ﬁnishes fourth.

This week, player Sam Colella
will try to break his third ‘place
tie with Smizik. Only one game
behind are the coaches. Bimbo
Cecconi tries to give the. coaches
the title. They are ﬁve games
back.

Co-eds Improve
A big surprise. in the second

-half of the race has been the

showing of the co-eds. After about
ﬁve disasterous weeks they have
improved to a state of being over
.500 for the last four. This week,
Marilyn Eiges, a junior Psycho-
logy major from New York hopes
to at least beat Matt Nesvisky.
This should be as easy as the
Yankees defeating the Mets.
Nesvisky.is close to the all time
record; the distinction of having
the worst record ever. When
asked how he managed to be so
poor Nesvisky responded, “It
comes natural.” ‘
Bouncing -into the sports office
with his usual smile Nesvisky
asked, “What was my record last
week?” «When told it was.5-10,
“Nostradamus” Cluipped, iiwhat
am I, Woolworths?”

 

B IL L KALIDEN, the freshman
football coach, quarterbacked f0I‘
the North team in the 1958 North-
South football game in Miami.
