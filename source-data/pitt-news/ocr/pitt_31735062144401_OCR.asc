/ SPRING FESTIVAL becomes PITT TRADITION

b

TRAHITI

Since its origin in 1933, Spring
Festival has become more and more a
part of campus life and tradition. Al-
though twelve years may not be a very
long existence, Pitt students now re-
gard it as deﬁnitely “the thing to do
in spring.”

At the ’33 Festival, the main dance
was held at the Grotto Ballroom, and
featured the respective orchestras of
Ted Rosenberg and Bert Wieden-
hamer. The Festival also included Tap
Day Assembly, a Hoop-rolling race,
a roller skating relay, (They were
really active in those days), a scooter
race, (Wheeeee!), an Inter-fraternity
Sweepstakes, and an All-University
Sports dance.

Many of the previous Festivals in-
cluded Carnival Nights, at which
various activities operated a booth or
concession. Float parade and street
fairs also dotted the scene down
the years.

In 1940, the tea dance held at the
Schenley was called the “Hula Hop,”
(hmmmmmm, sounds intriguing).
Among other items, Carnival Night
prizes included water pistols, cream
puﬂ’s, chocolate eclairs and some
baby shoes; the featured event of the
evening was a pie ﬁght. Carnival
nights were usually held in Lily Court,
which was, as a rule, vividly spot-
lighted for the occasion by the Du-
quesne Light company.

In ’39, a name band was engaged
for the big dance. It was the “slide
music” of Will Osborne and his or-
chestra, who played for dances from
9 to 1 in the Schenley ballroom.

Floats Add
Gaiety To
Festival

The Pitt News weatherman says,
“Friday afternoon will be sunny.” So
look out!! We’re not responsible for
what you’ll see on the lawn from 3:15

 

.- toil: 30 when all the women’s frater-

nities put on their ﬂoat parade.

Their theme is, “If we were Bar-
num and Bailey we would . . . . ”
That will bring out bearded ladies,
Lady Godivas, and bareback riders.
We’ll be on hand as judges chewing
celery stalks and bringing ﬁsh for the
trained seals.

Chairman Gerry McDonough says,
“We hope the ﬂoats will help add
gaiety and color to this novel “Circus
Festival.” The fraternities will display
the ﬂoats in the Common room if the
weather is bad.

Honor Day
Luncheon

Honor’s Day Luncheon for all per-
sons tapped this morning will take
place immediately after Tap Day cere-
monies have been concluded. It will
take place in the Supper Room of
the Hotel Schenley.

The luncheon will establish a new
precedent for honoring tappees, this
being the ﬁrst time such an event has
been held. Guest speaker will be Dr.
J. W. Oliver, head of the history de-
partment.

Chairman of the dinner is James
Ludwig, Col., assisted by Jojo New-
stetter, C01. and D. J. Jamison, Col.

Bonﬁre Picnic

Plans Rodeo

Pitt Circus moves to Panther Hol-
low in Schenley park Friday evening
at six o’clock. The Bonﬁre picnic will
feature the Rodeo and Wild West
show.

Each of the men’s fraternities will
present a skit which follows the theme
“If we were a part of the Rodeo tha
is in Pittsburgh we would . . . . . . ”
They will be judged on the basis of
attendance, originality, appearance,
and enthusiasm. Prizes will be offered.
And, incidentally, the boys are said
to have some surprises in store.

Arrangements have been made for
plenty of good things to eat, a roaring
ﬁre and some surprise features that
you can’t miss!

No one needs a date. Just come and
have fun. It’s all out college and calls
for blue jeans, plaid shirts and any
old clothes. You might bring a poncho
or blanket to sit on.

SKYSCRAPER CAPERS

Do you have an urge to warble those good old barbershop tunes?
Have you yearned to see a can-can chorus close up? Would you see

Pitt’s Lauren Bacall accompanied by Ho«agy Carmichael? Do your

feet hurt you? Then by all means come and recline in Stephen Foster’s

plush loge seats this Thursday night.

Yep, tomorrow night at 8:15 is the big date for the student

directed-student acted Skyscraper Ca-
pers. Fun for all and harmony on
every side——with the exception of that

pseudo basso to your rear. Buy your

cents, (if you haven’t already bought
a strip ticket). And ssshh, there’s a
big surprise coming to a lucky ticket
holder. You wanta be him ?——we’ll see

ticket at the door for a paltry thirty! you there.

the “Candy Stick Bridge” at the wom-
en’s fraternity houses and apartments
on Saturday.

Anything you want to play from
bridge to fish will start at 2 o’clock.
Then come refreshments. (Count me
in for seconds.) “So long” is at ﬁve.

Board are sponsoring this Spring Fes-

are 75 cents and can be bought from
any fraternity woman or Mortar

ERAEHER JACK Bﬂl

Who invented the airplane was the
question when your dad was a boy.
What makes the wbrld go round will
still be pondered over by men in the
future, but right now the all-important
question is: WHAT IS IN THE

CRACKER-JACK BOX?

Mm-m-m-m, it could be an old
shoe. Could be. But it isn’t!! It could
be a clown, well, c.-juld be.

Come on, all you eager beavers, set
your ingenius little minds to working.
Figure out what “IT” is, then come to
the Three-Ring Swing on Saturday
night and hand in yyour “brainchild”
on a slip of paper at the door. See you
Saturday night . . . with the answer!

(Clue: Lana Turner is not in the

box.)

Tea Dance Slated for Thursday

Hey, gang, don’t be in the depths of depression tomorrow, Thursday

afternoon .

. . if you crave depths why don’t you bounce down to the “Cotton

Candy Ball” in the basement gym. The biggest’ name bands in the country
will be assembled (via juke box, of course).

You’ll jump; you’ll glide; you’ll wriggle and reel. It’s going to be the
biggest and best we’ve ever had. What we lack in live pachyderms we’ll supply
in crepe paper; and, don’t get excited, but we’ve put one over on Barnyard

and Daily . .

. we’ve found another egress. Don’t forget! It’s the “Cotton

Candy Ball” from 3:30 to 5:00 in the gym. See you all there!!

SPORTS EVENTS . . .

Come‘ on all you speedsters!! Come out to the-Inter-Fraternity

athletic events!!

If you are in a “ducky” mood, come to the swim meet at Trees’

Gym at 7 :30 tonight.

If it’s racing you’re after, we’ll see you at the Track Meet Thurs-
day afternoon at 2 o’clock at the Stadium.

G. Kepler Mills, instructor in phys-
ical education will preside over the
events. Ralph Mitterling and Robert
Hoel will oﬂiciate at the meet. These
events will decide who will hold the
Inter-Fraternity Sports’ Cup for next
year.

There will be one change from the

rules of last year goverhing these two
events. One man will be allowed to
participate in three events, but one of
the events must be a relay.

The track and swim meet is ex-
pected to be as much of a “Circus” as
the other events during Spring Fes-
tival Week.

Tbree Ring Swing Dance

Here it is . . . your last chance!

With this dance we climax another school year. It’s the ultra
wind-up to this year’s Spring Festival . . . it’s the Three-Ring Swing!!!
Step right up. We have two for the price of one; yes, indeed, there’ll be
two bands sending music your way. Bob Rhodes and Eddie Koch, who’s
taken over Skip Strahl’s band, will be on hand to furnish you with

puhlenty of dancing pleasure.

Bring your favorite date! It’s the
Hotel Schenley main ballroom on
Saturday night, May 5, from 8:30 to
11:30 o’clock. Just tear the dance
ticket from your strip and present it at

the door. However, in case by some
crude miscarriage of justice, you have
failed to procure a strip ticket, there’ll
be dance ducats at the door for the

nominal sum of only $3.00 per couple.

Annual Tap Day on Friday

This year’s Tap Day will be held Friday, May 4:, at 10:30 o’clock
on the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ memorial open air pavilion. If weather
