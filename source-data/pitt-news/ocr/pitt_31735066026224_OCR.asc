Pitt police arrest 5 suspects for beating

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News’ Editor

Five teenagers were arrested over the
weekend and charged in connection
with the brutal beating of a Pitt student.

“All five people are all locked up,”
said Rick Boyd, director of Pitt Public
Safety. ’

The arrests stem from a week-long
investigation after David Orsborn, 20,
was beaten and knocked unconscious" on
the steps of the Towers on Jan. 13.

‘A 14-year-old, two 15-year-olds and a

17-year-old were arrested and taken to
the Schuman Detention Center. Because
of their age, police have not released
their names. .

A fifth person charged in the attack,
Toby Ekunfeo, 18, of Homewood, is
being held in the Allegheny County Jail.

All the suspects were charged with
aggravated assault and conspiracy, and
the Public Safety Department is seeking
the charge of ethnic intimidation on the
14-year-old. I

“He basically initiated the action,”
Boyd said. “He started it off with a

racial epithet.”

The first arrest was made Friday
around 11 a.m. That individual con-
fessed to the crime, and his information
partly led to the other arrests, Boyd said.

Friday night two more people were
apprehended. Then, Public Safety arrest-
ed the fourth and fifth suspects Saturday.

Boyd said two uniformed officers,
Mike Pampena and Heidi Cohen, played
a key role in apprehending the alleged
attackers.

“They stopped two people several

anniversary

 

By Allison Stallone
For The Pitt News

On Jan. 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court
gave women the right to have an abortion in the
landmark case Roe vs Wade, and yesterday Pitt’s
Campus Women’s Organization celebrated the

anniversary of that decision.

“For these past 22 years, thousands of women
— our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, our
friends and ourselves —— have been able to
choose safe, legal abortion to terminate an
unwanted pregnancy,” said Mary Litman, co-
president of the Squirrel Hill Chapter of the
National Organization of Women.

The audience of 140 in the ballroom of the
Vifrlliam Pitt Union cheered as Litrnan read her
speech and as other speakers from the American
Civil Liberties Union, Med Students for Choice,
CWO and other organizations spoke to the

crowd.

The crowd held up posters saying: “Beware Of
Politicians Who Only Care About You Before
You Were Born And After You Die,” and “Stop
the violence. We demand safe access to clinics.”

Author draws from his life and race relations for book

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

While working as a reporter
for The Washington Post,
Nathan McCall often visited
his hometown Portsmouth,
Va., and checked up on what
his old friends were up to.

One had shot a man in the
head. Another had been sen-
tenced to serve life in prison
for selling drugs. And a third
had been killed.

“I decided I was going to
write something about it,”
McCall said Thursday night in
the William Pitt Union. “I
decided I had to write some-
thing about it.”

McCall traced his own path,
from committing crimes in his
youth to serving 12 years in
prison to entering a journalism
career and watching the
world’s opportunities pass by
his friends, in his book
“Makes Me Wanna Holler.”
The book became a New York

‘Times bestseller and will soon

become a movie.

The book explains how the
race relations crisis in
America has impacted his life,
McCall said. Since his book
deals so much with racial
issues, McCall said some
asked him, “Are you obsessed
with race?”

“Yeah, I’m obsessed with

race,” McCall said Thursday.
“White America has an obses-
sion with race, and that has a
profound effect on my life.”

Most of today’s major issues
-— violence in America, crime
and punishment, gun control,
welfare reform — have racial
implications, McCall said.

It was easy for Susan Smith
to tell police that her children
were kidnapped by a black
man, “because she knew she
could play on people’s percep-
tions about black men and
crime,” McCall said. Smith
later confessed that she let her
two children drown.

McCall said he wrote his
book to paint his life as a

microcosm, not to speak for
all black men in America.

“I can’t even pretend to do
that,” he said. “Contrary to
popular belief, we’re not
monolithic.”

He also wanted to explain

‘why everybody who commits

a crime is not a criminal. As a
teenager, McCall said he and
his friends robbed and gang-
raped because they were con-
fused and consumed with a
blind rage that they didn’t
understand.

They assumed they didn’t
have a future to protect. When
you don’t envision a future,
“you don’t care about ruining

TEL AVIV, Israel — Two
explosions rocked Tel Aviv
on Sunday resulting in 18
people dead and 62 wounded.
A Muslim man suspected to
be the suicide bomber ignited
the bomb near a crowded bus
stop north of Tel Aviv.

The first bomb exploded
near the east wall of a snack
bar, and the second, near the
other, blew up the bomber
himself after a group of sol-
diers tried to capture him.

Later, the leader of an
Islamic Jihad group claimed
responsibility for the bombing
which is rated one of the
deadliest in recent history.

Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and PLO leader Yasser
Arafat both denounced the
bombing. — Reuters

GRONZY — Bombing con-
tinued outside the city of
Grozny on Sunday. Buildings
smoldered from the bombing,
and in the distance echoed
machine gun fire.

The city of Grozny, which
was home to 400,000 people
before the fighting began,
went from bad to worse.
There is little food and water
available for residents.

Student
and mom
arrested
for bizarre
beeﬁng

By Mark Gordon

Asst. News Editor

A Pitt student was hos-
pitalized Wednesday
night after being beaten
by another Pitt student
and her mother.

Candice Winn, 18, and
her mother Ella Jones
were arrested by Pitt
Public Safety in a bizarre
attack near Caleco’s Bar
on Oakland Avenue.

According to Public
Safety, around 11:30 p.m.
Wednesday, Winn, along
with a “mo ” of about 20
people approached the
victim’s dorm room in
the Towers, demanding
to see her.

The victim’s roommate
said she was not there
and that she was near
Caleco’s.

Winn, Jones and a third
accomplice, a 15-year-
old, tracked down the
victim on Sennot and
Oakland Avenue.

The victim said that
Winn pulled a knife, and
the trio repeatedly hit the
victim in the face, head
and chest.

When police arrested
Winn, they found a pair
of scissors in her posses-
sion, according to
Director of Public Safety
Rick Boyd.

The victim was found
with her nose bleeding,
spitting up blood and
complaining of chest
pain. She was taken to
Presbyterian University
Hospital.

“Our understanding is
that this entire episode
originated from the feel-
ing that the victim was
giving the suspect the
‘evil eye,”’ Boyd said.

your own life or even others’ lives,” he
said.

While serving time in prison, he began
to change, McCall said. He discovered
himself through writing and reading. He
wrote in his journal whenever he felt
depressed, and he got a job in the prison
library. He read about philosophy and
religion and then tried to apply the princi-
ples he read about. He began to learn to
love and respect himself. He began to
rethink his attitude towards women.

Self-hatred among young black men
manifests itself in the way many of them
treat women, McCall said. He and his
friends gang-raped because they couldn’t
really love women and treat them with
respect until they learned to respect them-
selves. Also, McCall learned about sex
from the guys on the block, not from his
parents. So some “perverted notions” fil-
tered into his sex education, he said.

Although the rally was to cele-

“There’s a concern for people’s

blocks away [from the
Towers] about 20 minutes
later,” Boyd said. “Those two
kids provided phony names,
but with the help of the city
police, the FBI and the state
Attorney General’s Office,
we were able to identify
them.”

Pampena and Cohen
sought out the suspects from
a description that was pro-
vided by a Pitt student who
witnessed the attack. That
description was put out “over
the radio for our officers and
Zone 6 officers,” according
to Boyd.

After the initial student
came forward and the inci-
dent was publicized, more
students contacted Public
Safety with information, said

‘ Boyd.

Orsborn, a junior majoring
in film studies, is in the
intensive care unit at
Presbyterian University
Hospital. Last Thursday he
had surgery on his face, and
hospital officials said he is in
serious condition.

“It is a terrible thing that
this assault happened, but the
university should feel good
that the individuals were
caught,” Boyd said.

“Obviously, we are very
pleased with the arrests,”
said Leon Haley, Pitt’s vice
chancellor for student and
public affairs. “We think stu-
dents can begin to feel some-
what more comfortable.’’'

“The investigators have
been working almost non-
stop, around the clock on
this,” Boyd said.

“I think it speaks well of
our campus security,” Haley
added.

Boyd said Public Safety
believes the beating was
gang—re1ated.

The four juveniles arrested
will have a hearing today at

the Schuman Center, and

Ekunfeo will have a hearing
within 10 days, according to
Boyd.

into people’s faces.”

But surprisingly, not many
protestors showed up at the rally.
There were only about five
standing in the back of the room
waving “Pro Woman -— Pro
Life” signs.

Carolyn Segermark, a
Carnegie—Mellon University stu-
dent and member of Students for
Life, was a little disappointed in
the turnout and the recent vio-
lence that has escalated at abor-
tion clinics. “I think it’s terrible
that people think pro-life and
they think of violence. I do not
associate myself with those peo-
ple,” she said.

And Dr. Robert Kisner, a
Pittsburgh doctor who provides
abortion services, told the crowd
about protestors blockading his
office, picketing his home and
harassing him and his wife, but
insisted that none of those things
will turn him away from provid-
ing those services. An audience
member responded with, “And
we won’t murder pro-life
extremists either.”

Although they were discussing
violence and killings, some Pitt
students who attended said they
couldn’t be happier with the
rally. “I think it’s great that
we’re getting together. One per-
son can make a difference,” said
student Kim Graziani.

Sudzina was hoping this
would be the feeling when she
prepared for the event.

“We are honoring and support-

ing doctors, clinicians and
escorts who support women’s
choice,” Sudzina said. “This was
absolutely one of the most
important decisions ever made in
every woman’s life.”

The support for the employees
at abortion clinics and the timing
of the event have come at a criti-
cal time, since Paul Hill was just
convicted of murdering a doctor
and his escort at an abortion clin-
ic in Florida and John Salvi will
stand trial for killing two recep-
tionists at abortion clinics in
Massachusetts and shooting at
the outside of a third clinic in
Virginia.

“We are very passionate peo-
ple who believe in women’s
rights to have control over their
own body, but it frightens me
that Hill says this kind of prac-
tice will become commonplace,”
said Sudzina.

There have been many obsta-
cles for the pro-choice groups
this past year, including fonner
Gov. Casey’s Abortion Control
Act which requires a 24-hour
waiting period before having an
abortion, parental consent for
women under 18 and spousal
notification. They celebrated the
anniversary of a decision that 22
years later still brings controver-
sy, but Sudzina said they are pre-
pared for the battles ahead.

“We will be reminding [Gov.]
Tom Ridge about these prob-
lems, and we will be tireless in
our efforts during the next few
Republican years,” said Sudzina.

Last Thursday, the House Subcommittee on Health, Human
Services and Education began holding hearings into whether
the federal subsidy for The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting would be cut as part of the Republicans’
“Contract with America.” Once again it looks as though edu-
cation and the public's access to unbiased information will be
sacrificed to the garrison state of a bigger military and more
prisons. '

Rep. Robert Livingston, a Republican from Louisiana, was
quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as saying “The issue
that brings us here today isn’t the merits or demerits of pub-
lic broadcasting. The issue is that over the last 25 years we
have accumulated a $5 trillion debt.” This debt is a direct
result of 12 years of a military build-up which the Contract
with America seems to want to add to by providing for
increased national defense. A larger national defense against
whom? Canada has softened its foreign policy towards the
United States.

According to Richard Carlson, the president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 90 percent of the feder-
al subsidy is given to 629 radio stations and 351 television
stations. Some of these smaller market stations would be
destroyed by the loss of these federal funds. According to
Carlson, the federal funds‘ allow the stations to raise money
from other sources.. The federal funds for something which
seeks to edify the American people should be left intact,
instead of spending increasing amounts of money on phan-—
tom enemies-of-the-month. _

The people of this country have the right to have television
and radio which isn't controlled by the Republican's favorite

' interest, big business.

Only Ihe beginning

After a week-long investigation, five teenagers were arrest-
ed and charged in connection with the attack on Pitt student
David Orsborn. Two of the students were stopped by Pitt
police officers several blocks from the Towers on the same
night of the attack. Pitt’s Department of Public Safety worked
‘with several law enforcement agencies to solve the case.

After the beating had come into thepublic eye, several stu-
dents came forward to provide information to the Department
of Public Safety. Almost all the witnesses are Pitt students.

This is a good first step, and it is encouraging to know that
the campus police are able to work in conjunction with city
and national agencies to keep Pitt civilized. The Department
of Public Safety has done a laudable job in the handling of
this case. »

Those who came forward now must set an example for the
rest of the community. They must be willing not only to tell
the police what they saw. but also to follow through to the
end. This would include testifying, if the need arises.

0.4. SiMPsot~l Case-

a s t
Tuesday
morning,

‘ the 87th man in
12 years was
executed in the
state of Texas.

At 12:21 a.m.,
Columnist the life of Mario
Erika Marquez was
Kendra finally brought

to an end by lethal injection, 11
years after raping and murder-
ing his l9-year-old wife and
her 14-year-old niece. As is
usually the case when capital
punishment is actuallytused, a
storm of controversy has
sprung up around Marquez’s
execution. Opponents to the
death penalty had an added
topic for debate in this case.
Marquez had an IQ of only 65
and had never finished grade
school.

Questions have been raised
about the propriety of execut-
ing a man with such a small
mental capacity. Marquez’s
attorney was able to delay the
execution for 10 years by filing
appeals to higher courts. It was
argued that Marquez’s dimin-
ished mental capacity made
him incapable of fully under-
standing what he had done and
what was happening to him.
However, Marquez’s statement
just prior to his death (as quot-
ed in The New York Times)
shows that he understood com-
pletely. -“I am truly sorry, and I
am paying with my life tonight
for taking these two lives.”

Marquez not only understood
what was happening, he apolo-
gized for what he had done.
This apology, however, does
not in any way diminish the
pure evil of what he had done,
nor does it excuse him for his
actions. Some might argue that
this was a true sign of repen-
tance and that Marquez should
have been pitied. But imagine a
world in which we could do
anything to anyone and face no
repercussions as long as we
said. ‘‘I’m sorry." Anarchy is
the word for this imaginary
universe. 1

Marquez’s attorney also
based his appeals on the fact
that the jury in this case had
been prevented from hearing
evidence relating to Marquez’s
childhood, during which he
was constantly beaten and then
abandoned at age 12. After
being forced to live on the
streets, Marquez began his life
in the world of drugs. All this,
considered along with his men-
tal problems, presumably
would have prevented a guilty
verdict or a death sentence if
the jury had been able to hear
It.

My question is this: how
much should we be allowed to
get away with because we had
a bad childhood? Certainly, the
circumstances in which
Marquez grew up were nothing
short of deplorable, but should
that be allowed to excuse a
man for two brutal murders? I
think not.

Does the fact that I was
spanked for jumping into a
mud puddle wearing my new
purple corduroy pants when I
was six give me free rein to
commit any crime I want and
blame it on my parents?
Certainly not. There are limits
to which a person can claim
neglect or abuse and get away
with (literally) murder. (It
should be noted that, to my
knowledge, Marquez’s attorney
never claimed that his client
was innocent, only that he
should not beheld responsi-

hble.)

The people who decry last
Tuesday’s execution need to
consider why we have a system

which includes capital punish-

ment. The justice system in this
country is designed to protect
the innocent as well as the
accused._ The appeals process
allows that mistakes can hap-
pen, but most of them are cor-
rected. Surely some may not be
in the first step. or even the
second. But is it necessary to
allow 10 or more years to try to
find one sympathetic judge to
overrule the decisions of so
many before him or her? This

Childhood trauma doesn ’f excuse adult crimes

endless appeals process should
be stopped. Capital punishment
might have more of a deterrent
effect if it were used on any
type of consistent basis. “But
doesn’t the accused have a
right to justice?” Of course. I
don’t suggest ending the
appeals process altogether, but
some type of limit should be
made. We may see this happen
during this era of “Getting

Tough On Crime.” '1 sincerely

hope so.

Instead’ of constantly

dwelling on whether a convict— V
ed man or woman doesn’t want 7

to face the consequences for
his or her actions, there are
other things we should concern
ourselves with. Don’t the vic-
tims of violent crime (and the
families of the victims) have
the right to demand justice for
what was done to them? Don’t
the people unaffected by a par-
ticular crime but always prone
to a subsequent offense by the
same criminal, have the right to
be safe in their own homes?
Shouldn’t we be able to walk
out of our homes without fear-
ing for our lives? The answer
to all these question is YES.
This growing effort to get
tough on crime is good, and
hopefully it will have a positive
effect-. But that, in itself, is not
enough. The solution to the
ever—rising rate of violent crime
is not only to get tough on
crime, but to get tough on
criminals. Harsher sentences
for anything beyond petty theft,
prison more like prisons
instead of Swedish vacation
resorts, longer mandatory sen-
tences for violent crimes, sen-
tences without parole for repeat
or violent offenders and (espe-
cially) a consistently used
death penalty are all needed
before violent crime rates will
drop in any significant way.

_ I am not sorry that Texas car-
ried out Marquez’s execution.
Perhaps we should ship all the
inmates on death row there.

the beloved
Penguins hit
the ice are back in heaven.
And this season, the average
Penguin fan, the guy who
will occasionally watch a
game if he has the chance,
will join the hardcore fan in
jubilation.

The reason is the short sea-

‘ son. It will even make the

lowest formgof fan, the band-
wagoners who don’t watch
the Pens until the playoffs,

happy. .
In fact, maybe the prob-

lems that hockey has had this

year will be good for the
sport.

Playing 48 games will
make the season more than a
tad bit exciting. Ask most
hockey fans about the regu-
lar season and they will tell
you a bunch of bull about
teams needing to find an
identity and how long it will
take for the club to jell.

What they really want to
say is that the regular season
is too long and boring.
Hockey season drags on
almost into the summer. A
recent promotional campaign
has called the Pens “The
Boys of Winter.”

Well I hate to say, this but
I can recall watching “The
Boys” while sitting on my
front porch in shorts and a t-
shirt.

The shortened schedule
will also make teams play
harder. Some players clearly
hold back during the regular
season only to pick up their
intensity and play their best
hockey in the playoffs. This
season, there will be very lit-
tle lagging as the value of
every game is multiplied.
Teams that hold back will
find themselves out of the
playoff picture in a hurry.
There will simply not be
enough time to make up
ground, especially if a team
starts off the season very hot.

The short season will do
wonders for Pittsburgh. Let’s
face it, the Penguins are an
old team.

You have to wonder how
long Ron Francis, Larry
Murphy and the rest of the
crew can go. The Pens are

A blue and gold Storm...  
Pitt wins first Big East gam, upsets St. Johns

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

It was only a matter of time
for the Pitt basketball team.

And yesterday, the inevitable
finally happened —— the
Panthers landed their first Big

East win,
upsetting
the St.
John’s Red
Storm 94-
87 in front
of 14,368
fans at
Madison Square Garden.

For Pitt (5-10 and 1-6 in
conference play), which has
lost five games by five points
or less, the win has been long
overdue.

“It’s really special,” Panther
head coach Ralph Willard said
at a postgame interview. “They
really deserve it. They kept
fighting the whole time. These
kids kept battling every
game.”

The Panthers, notoriously
known forletting winnable
games get away, saw a 15-
point halftime lead dwindle
away to four, 84-80, with a lit-
tle under two minutes remain-
ing.

But this time Pitt wouldn’t
be denied, as point guard
‘Andre Alridge sank eight
straight free throws in the last
minute to seal the victory.

“I wasn’t thinking about it,”
Alridge said of his late game
heroics. “I just shot them.”

Alridge, from Queens, N.Y.,
finished the game with 22
points in front of several fami-
ly members and friends.

“Just having to come here, to
have them here, gave me a lot
of confidence,” Alridge said. .

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team suffered a 63-62
loss at the hands of the Lady

Saturday night in
Philadelphia.

The first half went back

teams, but
the Lady

lead at the
break.

P a n t h e r
defense held the Lady
Wildcats to a low 28 percent
shooting in the first half and
enjoyed the statistical edge

“Obviously, statistics don’t

matter much. We shot better,
made more three-pointers --
we just didn’t win,” said
head coach Kirk Bruce.

The one key statistic that
haunts Bruce and the Lady
Panthers is missed foul
shots.

Pitt hit on only 10 of 22
from the line, a 45 percent
clip. But foul shots almost
pulled out a win for the
Panthers at the end.

With only two seconds
remaining in the game,
Panther shooting guard Erin
Miller stepped to the line
with Pitt down by three.

Miller drained both shots
to draw within one point, but
time was not on Pitt’s side.

Success nothing new
for freshman Howard

I By Michael Kovak

Staff Writer

Accolades andhonors have
followed the basketball
career of Pitt freshman sen-
sation Latia Howard, but
things have not come easily.

Originally born in
Uniontown,Pa., Howard
attended Central High
School in Washington.

There she was named a
Nike High School All-
American.

“In high school, I was a
star,” Howard said, “but the
adjustments come when you
get to college and you have
to put studies first.”

So far, Howard has been a
key ingredient in the.Lady
Panthers 10-4 start.

Howard, a 6—foot—2-inch
center, is third on the team
averaging l1.0 points per

game while leading the team
with 7.7 rebounds.

Howard ranks seventh in
the Big East in rebounds,
the’ only freshman in the top
10.

She attributes her early
college success to hard work.

“I think that my dedication
to being a good student and a
good basketball player will
help me achieve both,"
Howard said.

Howard’s play has also
helped settle questions for
head coach Kirk Bruce.

“When we recruited Latia,
we knew she was this good,”
Bruce said. ’

“We lost a number of play-
ers [last year], but Latia has
helpedfill the void.”

No. 23 Penn State tops women's swim team

Pih‘ edges
Nittany
Lions In
final race

By Tawnya Adams
Staff Writer

Penn State came to town
Friday thinking it could hold
the Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team under water to go
home with a win. The Panthers
surprised the Nittany «Lions
with a come-from—behind vic-
tory by a score of 122-121.

Entering the final two
events, Pitt trailed, 108-99.
Junior breaststroker Chris
Perry won the 200-meter
breaststroke to pull the
Panthers into contention with a
time of 2:09.18.

“I had a lot of pressure on
me to win that event,” Perry
said. “I didn’t feel I was swim-
ming too well during the meet,
but I had to put how I was feel-
ing behind me. I’m happy I
could come through for the
team.”

The 400-met-er freestyle
relay team, consisting of senior
J onti Bacharach, freshman Eric
Stefanski, junior Sami
Vartiainen and senior Matt
Brady, finished first with a
time of 3:05.55, to clinch the
win.

The Nittany Lions finished
second with a time of 3:08.45;

“We had several teams in the
relay. Our team had to win and
we had to get third place,
which we did, to win the
meet,” Brady said. “The big
battle was for third place — it
didn’t matter if Penn State got
second as long as we got the
win and third.”

The meet actually came
down to the last event and the
last swimmer, Gary Mule.
With Penn State capturing sec-
ond, the Panthers were a little
nervous while the other two
relay teams battled it out. The
Panthers pulled ahead to finish
with a time of 3:09.28, just in
front of the Lions’ 3:11.08. _

The Panthers were led by
Brady, who won the 500
freestyle (4:33.45), placed sec-
ond in the 1,000 free (9:30.87)
and anchored the winning 400
freestyle-relay team.

Senior David Williams also.

had an impressive performance
by winning the 100 free

(47.08), placing second in the ‘

200 free (l:42.11) and anchor-
ing the 40O medley relay.

Another member of the 400
free-relay team, Jonti
Bacharach, did his job by cap-
turing first place in the 200
freestyle with a time of
1:41.99.

Freshman Eric Stefanski was
a big contributor to the 400
free-relay team as well, and
also won the 200 backstroke.

crush them. I didn’t expect to
have the meet come down to

The Pitt women’s swim
team came back from a long
winter break to find the
nationally ranked Penn State
Nittany Lions squad eager to
take them on.

Pitt lost the meet, but like
the rest of its season, scores
and records can be mislead-
ing.

“Our record is misleading
because we go against
nationally ranked teams a
lot,” said co—captain swim-
mer Christy Knobloch.

“Our record is pretty mis-
leading because we did lose
some pretty close meets,”
said head coach Marian
Cassidy Keen.

Penn State, ranked 23rd in
the nation, beat Pitt (3-6)
yesterday at Trees Hall Pool
by a score of 162-116.

Keen said she was very
pleased with the overall
results.

Tony Fioiini/The Pitt News

Jenny Doran won the 200-meter butterfly in Pitt's 162-116 loss.

“It can be somewhat intim-
idating to compete against a
team like Penn State, consid-

ering where they are
ranked.”

Co—captain Vicki Geubtner

said the team swam really
well despite the score.”
“At one point we were
ahead,” Geubtner said.
“People on the team really
stepped it up, but in the sec-
ond half we did not have the
depth for going against a
nationally ranked team.”
According to Geubtner the
swimmers emphasized fin-
ishing in practice and it
showed in the meet.
Freshman Leslie Beckie
achieved a personal best of
2:14.67 in the 200-meter but-
terﬂy, and Jenny Doran won
that race with a time of
2:07.95
“I think we did really
well,” Beckie said. __
“A lot of swimmers had
their best times. We all
stepped up to get ready for
the Big East [competitions].”
Keen said that besides

Fletcher won the 100-

time of 1:08.25, barely
eclipsing Penn State’s Karna
Lorhammer, who finished
with a time of 1:08.59.

Knobloch said she was
pleased with her results
because she swam more
sprint events, which allowed
her to work on improving her
speed.

There were other Pitt
swimmers who had strong
races against Penn State.

Lindsay Swiderski took in
first place in the 1,650-meter
freestyle race, finishing with
a time of 18:04.73, and Kara
Sixbury finished first in
the intermedley diving com-
petition with a score of
265.35.

Diving teammate Sunday
Lewandowski grabbed sec-
ond place in the l—meter div-
ing competition, but she
ranked first in the 3—meter

competition, with a score of
307.65.

Along with those ratings,
the 200 medley relay team,
made up of Geubtner,
Beckie, Isabel Dejo and
Lauren Dale, just missed
capturing first place.

They finished with a time
of 1:51.22, .11 seconds
behind Penn State’s relay
team.

Coming up next for the
Panthers are the University
of West Virginia
Mountaineers.

“I think we have a really
good shot at beating West
Virginia,” Knobloch said.

“West Virginia will be a

said.

“We have a good rivalry

Beckie said the Panthers
are getting better everyday.

“I think we are a develop-

reasons.

The main reason was fami-
ly.
“It’s great to see them at
the games supporting you,”
she said.

Howard also said that she
liked the city environment of
Pittsburgh, and she immedi-
ately got along with the
team.

Howard’s finest individual
moment at Pitt came during
the week of Jan. 3 when she
was named Big East Rookie
of the Week.

During the Lady Panther
Invitational, Howard aver-
aged 18.5 points and 9.0
rebounds.

She was a perfect 9-of-9
from the foul line, and she
netted all—tournament team
honors.

So far this season, Howard
has earned four double—dou-
bles, leading the Lady
Panthers in that category.

Howard has many individ-
ual and team goals she would
like to achieve, with the most
important being a berth in the
NCAA tournament.

“I like our chances of play-
ing in the tournament as long
as we stay focused and beat
the teams we’re supposed to
beat,” Howard said. 0

Howard and the Lady
Panthers also are looking
toward a rematch against the
No. 1 Lady Huskies of
Connecticut. On Jan. 2, Pitt
lost to UConn 100-67.

“That game was a good
learning experience for
myself and the rest of the
team,” she said.

“At home, I think we’ll
definitely have a better shot
at Connecticut.”

Playing against teams like
Connecticut and the rest of
the Big East has given
Howard more determination.
During high school, she
played teams from Maryland
and Virginia until she tasted
college-level competition at
the Nike All-American
games.

Howard said even though
D.C. had some good teams,
playing college ball is a lot
different and that the desire
to be a better team is essen-

tial at this level.

“Every girl on the Pitt team
was a star in high school,
now you have to play better
team ball,” Howard said.

Howard has played basket-
ball for most of her life, but
her role models are not play-
ers.

“I admired players,”
Howard said, “but without
my mother, none of this
would be possible. She
comes up here a lot and gives
me support.”

The loss drops the

Panthers’ overall record to
11-5, but more importantly
Pitt falls to 5-3 in the Big
East.

Villanova, also 11-5,
moved ahead of Pitt for third
place in the Big East stand-
ings, raising its conference
record to 6-2.

The experience of
Vi1lanova’s all-senior start-
ing lineup slowed down the
tempo of the game, as the
Lady Wildcats shot 45 per-
cent from the field in the sec-
ond half and committed only
six turnovers for the entire

contest.
“I wouldn’t fault our
defense,” Bruce said.

“Villanova shot better in the
second half, but we just did
not do the things we had to
do to win.”

A quartet of Lady Panthers
scored in double figures.
Sophomore center Melissa
Thompson led the way with
her second straight double-
double, collecting 17 points
and 10 rebounds.

Latia Howard pumped in
13 points, and senior co-cap-
tains Jenine Joyce and Carol
Morton each scored 10
points.

“‘Nova is tough at home.
Any loss is always tough to
swallow, especially close
ones,” Bruce said.

“We just can’t let this
dampen our spirits because
we have Georgetown coming

up.”
This Wednesday, the Lady
Panthers travel to the

nation’s capital for what has
become a must-win confer-
ence game for Pitt.

The Lady Hoyas are at the
bottom of the conference
with only one Big East victo-
ry.
The Panthers are only 1-3
in the conference on the road
so far this season.

“We stress focusing on
each opponent,” Bruce said.
“We can’t afford to underes-
timate Georgetown. We
haven’t been a good road
team, so this should be a
tough game for us.”

the last event,” Stefanski said.

The diving team had some
tough competition, considering
Penn State has an All-America
diver who is going to the Pan-
American games in Argentina.

Despite this, the divers still
did well. The Lions’ Chris
Divine took first in the l— and
3-meter boards. Jeremy
'McClean captured second in
the 1-meter, and John Soulakis
took second in the 3-meter.

There is always a big rivalry
between the two teams. The
Nittany Lions usually do extra
things for the meet like shav-
ing swimmers, but this year
they didn’t do anything differ-
ent. This is the first time in
three years the Panthers have
beaten the Lions.

The lack of games will
allow older players to be in
much better physical condi-
tion for the playoffs.

Finally, the short season

happy-

They won’t have to wait as
long to buy game jerseys
when the playoffs start.
However, a drawback is that
the lack of games will not

ably make you sick to your

Storm’s hot shooting with a
harassing 2-2-1 press, and the

Panthers quickly erased the

deficit.

In the midst of an eventual
41-13 Panther run to end the
half, Pitt tied the game at 34
on Peterson’s jump hook.
Peterson followed that with
four more consecutive points
to give his team a four-point
lead.

After a Sotiris Aggelou
three-pointer, Peterson finding
a streaking Garrick Thomas
for an easy lay in and another
Peterson layup, Pitt sat com-
fortably at halftime with a 55-

40 lead.

The ironic part of Pitt’s huge
run was that it came without
forwards Orlando Antigua and
Chris Gant, who both picked
up their third fouls.
Essentially, the Panthers
played a four-guard offense
with Peterson in the middle.

“We got smaller, but we got
quicker,” said Willard, who
sealed his first Big East victo-
ry at Pitt. “They had problems
with our press.”

Off the press, Pitt caused 16
first-half turnovers, while
committing l2 miscues of its
own.

Maurice Brown, who was
scoreless in the first half,
opened the second session
with a three-pointer, and fol-
lowed it with another one three
minutes later to chisel Pitt’s
lead to 12.

With 12:26 remaining, fresh-
man center Zendon Hamilton’s
uncontested layup cut the
Panthers’ lead to single digits,
66-58. But Aggelou, who fin-
ished with 15 points, retaliated
with a steal and cashed it in
with a dunk.

Pitt kept a six-to-eight point
lead for about four minutes,
but St. John’s appeared to be
stealing the momentum.

At the 5:00 mark, Gant’s
layup gave Pitt a 10-point
cushion. Then the Red Storm
answered with a quick 7-0 run,
and when freshman sensation
Felipe Lopez converted a
layup, Pitt was on its heels
with a slim three-point lead,
80-77. ,

But St. John’s wouldn’t get
any closer, thanks to Alridge’s
free throw barrage.

The Red Storm’s loss is their
fifth in a row, dropping them
to 8-6 and 2-5 in the Big East.

St. John’s was led by power
forward Charles Minlend’s 20
points. Pitt held Lopez to 17,
four under his conference
average.

“Felipe has been taking 25
percent of their shots, and he
only had 12 shots today,”
Willard said.

The first time Pitt hooked up
with St. John’s, the Panthers
made a valiant second-half
run, only to lose 88-83 at the
Civic Arena.

“We came together,” Alridge
said. “We stepped up big time,
everyone did. Everyone want-
ed the ball.”

Pitt takes on Seton Hall
