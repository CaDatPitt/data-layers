A'l' U. of Miami

Coral Gables, Fla. -—- A physical
education course, Camping 220,
has mushroomed beyond all ex-
pectations here, according to Dr.
William H. Steers, professor in the
department of physical education
at the University of Miami.
Offered for the first ‘time by any
southern college, the course deals
with ﬁshing,‘ sailing, handicraft,
and community recreation. Care-
ful consideration is given to food
plurchase, selection of camp sites,
and handling of small children.
Inaugurated in September, 1947, _
student enrollment has since dou-
bled.

Since lack of Pitt support was responsible for
the Bucco’s failure to grab the pennant last season,
the thirty—fourth investigating committee of the

situation has suggested that Pittites be granted-

tickets and cuts to attend the opener on April 20.
Dr. Fitzgerald has revealed to the Traditions Com-
mittee of WSGA that Pitt support will hereafter be
a tradition at such events. Since this "year is a
‘ﬁrst’ along such lines, the business of exchanging
activities cards for Bucco tickets is fairly simple.
Take your card down to the post oﬂice on the
ground ﬂoor, have it walked upon. Then take it
down to ‘George’ in the sub-ground ﬂoor and
‘George’ will punch it for you. That punch plus
three bent nickles will buy a ticket for the opener.

sway while Bickey extolled the
brilliance of the idea. The big “M,”

chairman, business manager and
publicity chairman respectively,
were at once called into deep con-
sultation to plan the event. Tea

At this point in the proceedings

be felt in every corner. In fact
Maniac was himself in the cor-

“All Our Productions” the dyn-
amicly griping emotional. presen-
tation which won loud acclaim
from top Broadway critics during
its long run in Los Angeles will
be dramatized by that little the-
ater group who does not have the
facilities of Carnegie Tech or the
ﬁnancial _ backing of the Play
House, the Pitt Players.

The play ,was especially re-
adapted and ’ stolen from Hauf-
mann and Kart by Rowber Dom-
kus, one of the Players own inim-
itable, ill—dressed, stage hands.
The plot deﬁies explanation as
well as review but is mainly con-
cerned with some. middle aged
banker who thinks that he is
George Washington and is contin-
ually calling Room Service to
explain why it is impossible to
pay the room rent for himself
and Joan of Lorraine because the
last shipment of airplane parts
were rather defective. _

Aside from this there are a few
secondary tangents and sub-plots
such as how to get a full house,
what’s the matter with try-outs
he’s all right, and how to get a
membership that will leave the
old members do the acting.

As Dick Rover of the.Chicago
Sun said, “When Fill Awl speaks
those words at the endof three
acts of the most’ awe—provoking
drama, it is humanly impossible
to‘ keep your heart anywhere but
in' your throat.” Awl rings down
the curtain with awe, awe-nuts,
and awe—let’s—go-home.”

The play doesn’t need a pro-
fessional ‘cast, this in itself made
it a Player natural. As Dick Rov-
er of the World-Telegram said,
“The Players don’t act . . ._ they
live.” The former a bold fact the
latter a profound comment. But,
be you Ronald Coleman or Ned
Fester, it would be humanly im-
possible to read these pulse stir-
ring lines‘ without being for a mo-
ment transformed from your su-
perior self into the role of an or-
dinary person under the terrible

The cast is ably headed by Fill

Awl, fresh from an engagement,

at the Caravan Theater of Fine
Arts, and Smoeprine. ﬁoscoe,
graduate of West Penn Tech, who
between them. weight two hun-
dred and ﬁfty pounds. Fill Awl is
not a tall, dark engineering stu-
dent, I’ll say he’s not, he’s a
warm, human, old man who has
made a human mistake and is
just realizing how human a mis-
take you can make when you are
old -and warm andnhuman.

tices,‘ circle the stage in\ an am-’
bulatory manner, wearing what
Rowber Domkus classiﬁes» as an
entirely new innovation known as
bathing suits.

Sackie MacTim looked exceed-
ingly cute when her bathing suit
became entangled in the revolv-
ing door and here, a special word
of commendation to George Tracﬂ
tor that loveable, old prop-man.

At an impromptu after play
party Sed Tucker conﬁdently
stated that, “too many Pitties and
Pittsburghers alike are missing a.

ductions as “All Our Productions.”

‘What oMadeWhiterock\ Leap’  

The crushed and mangled body
of a Pitt student, later identiﬁed
as Jan Franklin Whiterock, Jr.,
was being picked out of ODK
walk today, piece by piece.

Amazed by the force of the im-

pact that drove Whiterock’s head
through four inches of concrete,

investigators from the oﬁice of the '

dean of women combed the 43rd
ﬂoor of the Shaft for evidence to
establish the motive behind young
Whiterock’s leap. ’

According to the ofﬁcial report
released today, Whiterock’s death
was the result of an accidental
fall from the top of the Shaft.

Whiterock was reported to have
led the undemocratic elections in
January during which the capi-
talistic war mongering men stu-
dents won a temporary victory by
a mere %' majority vote.

The decadent democratic press
of the western allies, led by Mich-
igan and Ohio State, have pub-
lished utterly false reports of a
suicide note in which Whiterock
Jr. was asserted to. have said:

“With the coup d’etat‘ and the

death of democratic government

at P.U., I feel that this is the only
Way I can express my disapproval
and at the same time escape pos-
sible persecution for my political
beliefs. (Whiterock, Jr. was pres-
ident of, the outlawed subversive

Pan Hellenic Council). Besides
they may try to push——” (Note
ended here).

Despite these vicious lies ,being
spread by the bureaucratic capi-
talists of the Big Ten powers, all
citizens of P.U. will of course be-
lieve the official report—-or suffer
a similar fate!

Commenting on the tragic death
of Jan‘ Whiterock, comrade Gynn
stated: “Had Whiterock, Jr. liv-
ed he would have undoubtedly
supported the new regime whole-

heartedly. Although he chose to
get his name in ODK walk the

hard way, Whiterock will be ac- ,

corded an ofﬁcial University fun-
eral—-with all the trimmings.”
Services will be held in Camp-
bell Cathedral under the direc-
tion of new University Chaplain

Florine Kneelin. The funeral will

be attended by defense commissar
Lariette Coalburner and an honor
guard of marshallettes.

Interment will be at 3 a. mi,
under the Phi Gam house.

LET IT BE KNOWN

Due to the’ overwhelming response, any campus or- '
ganization wishing to object to IALPHA SIGMA
SIGMA must ﬁrst submit a letter of qualiﬁcation to
the Panther. Upon receipt and approval of such a
letter, the Panther will assign a priority inumber

which must be adhered to when sending in the pro-
test. The mostoriginal objections will behung on
the Panther Bulletin Board and their senders will
be duly notiﬁed. We regret that time and space .
necessitate our being “sticky” about this.

Lena is known to students for

to leave her permanent mark here

packers purchase 127 million cattle,

Raw Potatoes ,

When raw potatoes are called for
in a recipe such as in scallop or
soup, the peelings -should be kept
very thin. Also, they should be
peeled just before cooking and not
allowed to soak in water. If the
potatoes must be peeled ahead of
time, they should be put in salted
water. The best way to, serve
all potatoes is ,quick-cooked and
steaming hot. The longer they stand
in the air, the more vitamin C they
lose.

Wartime Spending

At the peak of the war effort the
government was spending 100 bil-
lion dollars a year, 8 billion dollars
a month, 2 billion dollars a week,
12 million dollars an hour, $200,000
a minute" and $3,333 a second.

Experimental research results in better
Vitamin D source for poultry industry

Fifteen years of work by Du Pont

chemists, biochemists, physicists,

and engineers behind develop-
ment of “DEL§TEROL" '

In 1922, it was shown that vitamin D
controls the utilization of calcium and
phosphorus in the body, especially in ,
the bonesiof growing animals. This led
to the discovery that leg weakness in '
chicks, poor production,low hatchability
of eggs, and other disturbances were
caused by a deﬁciency of this vitamin.

Scientists subsequently discovered
that vitamin D could be made by irradi-
ating plant or animal tissues with ultra-
violet light. This reaction has since been
shown to consist of transforming cer-
tain provitamins from the group known
as sterols, into vitamin D. The ﬁnal re-
sult of these discoveries was the present

Dear Sir:

In Reference to As Handicap

March 31, 1948

 

 

I am writing you this letter on behalf of the Sigma Omicron .

Beta fraternity to protest your shabby coverage of Greek
sports events. At the last S.O.B. affair, not one News reporter
was present. -

I refer speciﬁcally to the Armpit Smelling Handicaps at
our luxurious houseon South Soho Street when the SOB’s upset
the heaV11>’ ﬂavored P‘ U‘  Nmvus face it Mr. Editor (sports), you
even a box score_ was carried in ‘
the subsequent editions of the
News.

I don’t think that 'I am being
selﬁsh when I ream you for not‘
giving us enough space. After all
these events are to the interest
and benefit of the University. Ev-
eryone should know of them. '

Thirteen spectators attended the
match including two independents
who were attracted by the smell.

This evidence should substan-
tiate the interest in‘ our aﬁairs
which you claim doesn’t exist. Our
match was a stinking success. Let

stand the smell? '

We didn’t mind when the SOB’s
weren’t mentioned as running up
the league in IF basketball. After
all, someone had to tie up last
place. That is-why there is a last
place. Yet’when something wafts
up in which we’ rank, where are
you? ‘

Success doesn’t come easy to us.
We have had to train hard togget
where we are today\Armpit teams
are accumulated not born. The
SOB’s have had a tough uphill
crawl to ﬁrst place. The FO’s near-.
ly upset. us and you know what
the BS’s did to them.

Hell fellow, we are the only ac-.
’ tivities men on the campus. If it
wasn’t. for Lfs, what do you think
would go on after dark? In a re-
cent poll taken by IF council, it
was found that 97.3 per cent of
all fraternity men are in favor of
action after sundown. ‘

No other group would dare
make that ‘statement. I did a, little

.. checking and here is what I found.
‘ V The football team received 25
inches of space in the October

only 22 inches. _

Where is your sense of values
or did you get your job through
politics? '»

An apolOgy from you is in order.
Print it in the next editiontand
we will accept it. Rectify the sit-
uation! As I close, remember an-
other war may come, and we have
learned that you are still an en-
listed. man. ' ’

‘I’m Rlartlyr,’
Says Carlson

Dr. H. C. Carlson’s recent award
as the 1948 coach who has con-

has brought the ex—redhea'cl into
line with the investigation mania.

Accusations that the ice—cream'
eating mentor stuffed the ballot
box at the recent convention of

ketball Coaches have placed Carl-
son in the doghouse with his
coaching associates at the Uni-
versity.

In repudiation of the charge,
Carlson claimed, “The ﬁrst several
candidates turned the award
down. and I had to accept it to
save the Coaches’ committee from
embarrassment. I was a martyr.”

However, the reports have, it
that Carlson’s total of 453 votes,
with 398 coaches eligible to vote,
constitutes an infringement ' of
parliamentary voting procedure.

OlsonRingPast
Aids Advocates
Of Pitt Boxing

A drive to organize a boxing
teams at Pitt was given added
incentive recently when it was
learned that Carl Olson, the
mustachioed track coach, was
ﬁghting on the side. _

Proposing that Olson be nam-
ed coach of. a Panther boxing
squad, advocates of a ring squad
rushed to Athletic Director James
Hagan. They showed“‘him a news-
paper clipping which read:

MANILA, Jan. 17 (AP)
Carl Olson decisioned Boy
Broks of Manila in a close, 12-
round battle at Rizal Stadium-
tonight to regain the Philippine-
Hawaiian middleweight boxing
title he lost to the "Filipino two
months ago.

“There’s our coach,” they told
Hagan.

Anti-Olson forces immediately
attacked this program. They
shouted that the Pitt track head
already has his ﬁngers in too many
pies and that he probably never
would appear at Pitt’s “Stillman’s
Gyrnlaa '

“Now we know,” screamed one
particularly rabid anti-Olsonite,
“why he could aﬁord to have a
special brand of mustache wax
imported from Brazil.”

‘‘I’m even prouder of this vic-
tory than my tour through Europe

‘last summer,” Olson conﬁded to

reporters during an interview that
he cut short after four hours.

Commenting on the wax accu-
sation, he said, “After all, I must
maintain a natty appearance if
various track associations.”

The Panther track mentor ex-
plained that his most eﬁective
punch in the Manila brawl was a
straight right between the shoul-
der blades. .

home, replaces Benjamin Franklin Grady. Ben
conveniently arranged to-be out of town to-

guise of escorting a swimmer,
manager to the National AAU

swimming championships at Yale University

Pulchritudinous Esther Williams, MGM movie starlet, today was
named coach of the varsity swimming team to replace Benjamin
Franklin Grady, present head mentor.

Miss Williams’ appointment was expected to quiet the charge

appeal. Several members of the

squad have openly criticizede
Grady’s lack of ability to inspire
a male squad.

Comments from squad members
enthusiastically e n d o r s e d the
change in coaching. Dick Petro,
speedyfree-style sprinter, was one
of the most joyous for obvious
reasons. ‘

“I understand she posts herself
Fraternities build characters. ‘
at the ﬁnish line,” he mused ‘as
he rubbed his hands together. “I
can’tsee losing with incentive like
that.”

One married» swimmer, Bill
Grant, commented,‘ “This gets
rather involved. Er,‘ when will she
arrive?”

Another criticism of the depos-
ed coach, iGrady, was that his
team failed to win the Eastern
Collegiate title at Rutgers, where
they placed third.

Aministrative discontent had
ﬂared when the team disrupted
University ‘fpolicy” by winning
all dual meets, the ﬁrst such vi-

olation since 1940.

Manager Mike Musulin, who
maintains scrapbooks ‘of all the
accomplishments of Pitt tank
teams and prospective opponents,
revealed that varsitymen and vis-
itors would be “barred from the

coach’s and manager’s ofﬁce when
Miss Williams came in to see my

scrapbooks.” as
“I don’t keep etchings,” he con-

fided. “However, I believe that the .

new coach and I will be able to
cooperate.” A

Bill Manko, veteran backstrok-
er, suggested a new slogan, “Win
for Williams,” while such team-
mates as Dick McKee, Bill Coch-
ran, and Harry Lucas expressed
their approval of the slogan, as
Well as the coach.

Grady, plainly disappointed at '

the turn in events, perked up con-

siderably when his retention in

an advisory capacity was suggest-
ed by Miss Williams after she
saw his picture. A

Shrill Cries ‘Pooh’ at Report
Given by ‘That Other Group’ _

By Fat Burns a
While Pitt men everywhere wait anxiously for the report
of the Trustee’s investigative committee, Robert E. Shrill,
chairman of the Faculty Committee on Athleavics, suggested
publicly that the Trustees accept his eommittee’s recommenda-

tions en toto.

The Owl is out once a year.

“Our report was drafted by six
men who not only starred in col-
lege sports but who studied the
athletic _situation here intensive-
ly.” Shrill stated, “That other
group is totally inexperienced in
this ﬁeld.”
Al Roth smokes Philip Morris.
J. G. Suickly (University cata-
logue) even attended the Pitt-
N otre Dame game last Fall.” “That
he-——That he was maily interested
in checking the rumor that Moe
Harris had quit school is un-
important,” said the alWays—han-
dy faculty chairman.

“Then one afternoon I dismissed

my eighth-hour geology class and
drove to the practice ﬁeld. I scru-
tinized the football situation close-
ly as I passed.”

Man of the year: Joe Browne.

Taking a parting blast at the
Student-Alumni committee, Shrill
pointed out:

He’s coming back on April 19.

_“After all, that group was made
up of merely two varsity letter-
men, an ex—football playing stu-
dent, and two other students inter-
ested only in football, basketball,
baseball, track, tennis, golf, and
swimming. What right do they
have to conduct an athletic inves-
tigation?”

ConfusesPtt’s
Track Trouble

Pitt’s track situation lay dis-
torted and deformed this week as
a result of inaccurate reporting
in last Wednesday’s and Thurs-
day’s Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

The quitting of two trackmen
and "the outspoken dissatisfaction
of numerous others was originally
‘reported by the Pitt »News last
Tuesday. The Post picked up the
story from the News but gave it
several new twists and curls. They
are: A

Distortions

‘Distortion No. 1 ——-A The Post-
Gazette reported that’ the two re-
signees, Ed Sudzina and John Wil-
son, had quit “after criticising uni-
versity policy and the coaching of

, Carl Olson.” In point of fact, all

statements critical of coaching or
policy were issued not by Sudzina
or Wilson, but by trackmen who

. desire that their names be held in

conﬁdence.

Distortion No. 2 ‘—- The Post-
Gazette spoke _of “a Pitt News re-
port that he (Wilson) had quit the
squad because of University pol-
icy and dissatisfaction with the
coaching of Olson.” Actually, the
News said that Wilson quit be-
cause his class schedule conﬂicts

A with track practices.

Did Not Apologize
Distortion N 0. 3 —— The Post re-
.ported that Wilson had “apologiz-
_ed” to Coach Olson for his state-
ments. “I had nothing to apologize

, for,” Wilson Stated this week. “I

quit the team simply because my
class schedule conﬂicts with prac-
tice.” V -.

Congress Completes By-Laws;
Enactment Awaits Student Vote

The recently-proposed Student
Congress By-Laws were given the
last once over Tuesday by Con-
gress and now stand approved for
submission to the student elec-
torate in the coming spring _elec-
tions. it

One of the major changes made
in the By-Laws" occurs in the new
Nominating Section, partially as ’a
result of a _letter to Student Con-
gress protesting the Men’s Nomi-
nating Committee.

Prior to the adoption of the By-
Laws, it was the job of the Nomi-
nating Committee to choose from
a ﬁeldof applicants two‘ candi-
dates to run for each office of Stu-
dent Congress open to election.
This method proved unsatisfactory
because rejected applicants often
charged discrimination. '

Mr. Lehrman‘ will hit on the’
major enigmas of the day, such
as what‘ the Russians want, and
what we shall do about them.

That same evening Lehrman
will speak again for the Phi Eta
Sigma, honorary scholastic frater-
nity, at their initiation ceremonies
at the Webster Hall. His subject
will be “The Russian Way. and.
the Common Man.” J, _ -

Lehrman, a native New York-

growth of Soviet power and the
rise of Russia’s satellite states. He
