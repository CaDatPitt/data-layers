 

OF THE WAR

Former ambassador talks of problems aﬁerfwarends

By Andrea Guilfoy

For the Pitt News

Walter L. Cutler, former U.S. ambassador
to Saudi Arabia, said the crisis in the
Persian Gulf is full of challenges and
opportunities for the United States.

“Diplomatically and militarily, the United
States has done pretty well, but after the
fighting stops, we will face several
challenges and opportunities that will mean
a lot to our ﬁrture, as well as the future of
the Middle East,” he said yesterday in a
speech in David Lawrence Hall.

A career diplomat since 1957, Cutler
said that unless the United States and its
allies make a serious effort to resolve the
Palestinian crisis, the Middle East will
remain unstable. He also said the
disappearance of the Iraqi threat could
help Israel feel more secure and make the
Arabs more willing to cooperate with the
Palestinian situation.

Cutler said the chaos rnihgt provoke the
United States to take a serious look at how
dependent it has become on other parts of
the world for resources, particularly oil.
He said that unless the United States gets
serious and takes a new look at the
situation, it will remain dependent on
imported oil from the Middle East.

“As we look beyond the crisis, this is the
area where we're most likely to fail,”
Cutler said. “Our major challenge in the
Mideast will be to create lasting stability
and peace so that our own interests will be
better protected.

are,” said Cutler. “If I had been up here six
months ago, I’d be talking about the
demise of global communism and the end
of the Cold War and only mention the
Middle East in passing.” _

As someone who has worked for the
government and also lived and worked in
the Middle East, he said he believes that
this is the most unpredictable crisis the
United States has ever been involved in.

Cutler gave President Bush very high
grades, calling Bush’s efforts in the Middle
East “a masterful job of crisis management.”

He said it was impressive that the United
States took the lead putting together a
Coalition, along with the United Nations,
to impose sanctions and to contain Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.

Cutler said there is no doubt that Kuwait
will be liberated, and that the war may
even end in a matter of weeks, but there
are two separate sets of perceptions:
Hussein’s and the United States’.

Cutler said in the eyes of the government,

the _war has moved along pretty well.

There have been very few casualties on
either side, and pinpoint bombing with
advanced technology has reduced Iraq’s
military and nuclear strength. The coalition
is holding together, and there is a great
amount of domestic support for the United
States, he said.

He went on to say that Saddam has a
very different perception. He said Saddam
is looking at the situation and thinking he
has managed to ﬁght the military colossus
of the world and widen the war by attacking

“It’s hard to believe we are where we

Groups say hemp
should be legalized

By Lisa Oshop
Staﬂ“ Writer

Popular culture stereotypes users and advocates of marijuana
as irrational or “burned-out” thinkers. However, if the claims of
hemp-advocacy groups like Help End Marijuana Prohibition
and National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws are
correct, then conventional wisdom may soon change.

‘Yesterday in the peninsula area of the William Pitt Union,
representatives of both groups hosted an information table and
sold T—shirts, bumper stickers and books espousing HEMP and
NORML’s philosophy that if legalized, hemp may be utilized
positively in the economic, environmental and medical
communities.

Dan Waterman, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences,
started HEMP on campus last fall after the William Pitt Union
house manager told Waterman he could not place-ﬂiers around
the building publicizing the Hemp Tour because it was not a
recognized student group.

In November, HEMP became an official Pitt group. The group
has 25 to 45 members; some use marijuana recreationally, and
others are concerned about the other benefits that hemp offers.
Although both hemp-advocacy groups stressed hemp’s potential
material contributions to society, Waterman ack-nowledged the
most well—known aspect of hemp as a mood-altering substance.

“[Hempl should be legalized for recreation as well as for
hundreds of other uses,” said Waterman. A

Bonnie Kurtz, an organizer for_the_Pittsburgh chapter of
NORML, was wearing a shirt made from hemp. Sfhefsaid that
hemp is a cheap alternative to other natural materials.

“Hemp is one-tenth as expensive as cotton. As [hemp is] a
weed, there is no need for fertilizer, and it doesn’t suffer from

a teleconference on “Mental Health Issues Related
to the Persian Gulf,” Friday for an audience of
parents, therapists and high-school counselors.

The teleconference was transmitted to more than
a dozen auditoriurns around the Pittsburgh area.
Listeners called in questions and comments for a
panel of three speakers who are professors of

Former US. ambassador to Saudi Arabia Walter L. Cutler talked about challenges that
the United States will face in the Middle East after the war with Iraq is over.

Mental effects of Gulf War examined

The three physicians each covered a different
aspect of the issue and gave information on how to
deal with anxieties due to the war.

Dr. Michelle Harrison gave a general overview
about war—related anxieties and assured listeners
that fear is normal as long as it is dealt with
properly. She said that these fears are brought
about by media exposure and the threat of a
military or terrorist attack close to home.

“The war is immediate because of the extensive

. media coverage we have seen thus far,” she said.

According to Harrison, media coverage of -the

T elefact funds secaredfor t/9 ree years

By Tammy Stradley
Staff Writer

Despite the previous Student
Government Board’s lack of a
concrete proposal, funding for
Telefact has been secured for a
three—year experimental period.

‘ The original funding for Telefact
was provided_by the SGB reserve
fund. Since the fund provides for
capital expenditures, it covered
only the program's setup costs.

Paul Stieman, vice president of
Computing and Information
Systems, told former SGB
President Julie Shepard that the
telecommunications department
would allocate up to $15,000 for
Telefact. This does not, however,
completely cover T elefact’s yearly
operating expenses, which are

between $30,000 and $55,000.
The source of the remaining
funding for Telefact had not been
agreed upon when the new SGB
came into office in January.
Adding Telefact to- the SGB
budget was a possible solution to
the problem, according to SGB
President Brent Saunders. If that
were the case, however, a future
SGB could decide not to put
Telefact in the budget, thereby
wasting all the time and money
already invested in the program.
Since The Pitt News became
independent from SGB funding
in 1987, the money allocated to
the Media Board for the
publication is now given back to
the SGB. Three percent of this
money, almost $24,000, will fund
Telefact, according to Saunders.

A management board will be
set up to determine the T elefact
budget so the money is spent
wisely. After three years, the
Office of Student Activities and
the SGB will evaluate the service
and decide if there is a need for
more or less funding. The money
that is not used by Telefact will
be given back to the SGB to be
allocated to student groups.. 7

Pam Gennaula, " student
coordinator of ‘Telefact, is happy
with the decisions of the SGB’ and
the university. 0 . ' ' I

“It’s showing clear support of
Telefact,” she said. ‘As far as
telecommunications giving us
one-third of the fee, I think it
even further supports us, and it’s
showing that [Telefact] isn’t limited
to students only."

Professional help often needed to cure eating disorders

Eating disorders have become
increasingly common in recent
years, especially among young
women. One eating disorder that
has received’ considerable
attention is bulimia nervosa, more
commonly referred to as bulimia
or the binge-purge cycle.

Some experts estimate that 20
to 30 percent of college women
engage in binge vomiting to

often the process begins with
excessive concern about weight
and body image, followed by
periods of strict dieting and high-
calorie binges. The excessive
eating is often followed by
feelings of shame and attempts
to eliminate the large food intake

weight-control method may be

depressed tend to follow.

Menstrual irregularities, swollen
glands, digestive—tract disorders,
tooth decay, kidney disease and
even heartvfailure may also result
from prolonged use of this weight-
control method.

The reasons people develop
this syndrome’ differ. Social

pressure upon women to be
excessively thin contributes to
the problem, and psychological
factors also play a role.

Some experts, for instance,
believe that women feel
considerable anxiety prior to
binge-purge episodes. The
binging and purging relieves the
anxiety temporarily and thus
comes to be seen as a perfect

reduction.

Most bulirnics continue this
behavior over a fairly long period
of time, usually convincing
themselves that they can stop it
any time they want. The fact is
that the behavior becomes
addictive and rarely goes away
by itself.

Individuals suffering from
bulimia take the first step to

recovery when they admit that

they have a problem. Help,
however, should then be sought
from professionals with expertise

in treating bulimia.

The treatment begins with a
complete physical examination
and then usually involves some
form of individual or group
therapy, as well as nutritional
counseling.

The recovery process is a
gradual one, but many people
have successfully overcome their
bulimia problem.

First terrorist attack of Gulf War leaves three injured

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

Three people were injured
yesterday when a bus in Jeddah,
Saudi Arabia, was fired upon.

The people, two of them U.S.
military personnel, were riding in
the bus when it came under attack.
They were injured by ﬂying glass
and not by the bullets themselves.
None of the injuries was severe.

This was the first terroristic
attack against the U.S. forces since
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
first said that he would use
terrorism against the allies.

In another possible terrorist
threat, people in Norfolk, Va.,
were evacuated from a storage
facility when it was discovered
that two explosive devices were
attached to the storage tanks.

Both devices were removed

from the tanks without any
damage. They were attached to
the valves of the tanks. The
explosives were pipe bombs, one
with two pipes, and the other
with four. Both were equipped
with elaborate timing devices,
which one Norfolk policeman
called “very sophisticated.”

One of the tanks was ﬁlled
with one million gallons of sodium
sulfate, a ﬂammable substance.
People within one square mile of
the site were evacuated.

The facility is within four miles
of Norfolk Naval Station, one of
the largest naval bases in the
world.

In other developments:

-Syria has vowed to stay with
the anti—Iraq coalition.

Many people within the allied
coalition feared that Syria would
side with Iraq if Israel retaliated
against the Iraqi Scud missile
attacks. But Syria’s information
minister said yesterday that Syria
“rejects the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and will not, under any
circumstances, change its stand

in this respect.”

Syria is one of the 29 countries
with troops stationed in Saudi
Arabia; however, Syria has not
taken part in any military action
against Iraq. Syrian officials said
that the troops are only there for
the defense of Syria.

-Iran has offered a possible
solution to the war in the Persian
Gulf. Iranian President Hashimi
Rafsanjani said that he is willing

to talk to Saddam and ask him for
peace. Both sides in the conﬂict
have received this very coolly.

Iran has come into the
controversy in the past week since
as many as 100 Iraqi jets have
ﬂown into Iran, evading allied
forces.

that both American and French
troops are stationed within Iraqi

Pitt employees’ stoc/e

The club's business is making investments, and members
meet on the second Wednesday of each month to decide which
stocks the club should buy or sell. The Stock of the Month Club
is about 60 members strong and is led by Walter Ritenour, the
club president.

“This club is open only to university faculty and staff, but any
staff member can join,” said Ritenour. The club typically
requires a $10 entrance fee, but Ritenour has declared a three-
month “grace period” from now until the end of March in which
new members can join free of charge.

“We have an acquisition/ divestment committee, which

makes recommendations on which stocks to buy and sell. A
vote is then called," Ritenour said.

Ritenour said that the club has had some major successes,
especially with big businesses. Heinz Co., General Electric and

Israel. In his eyes he has weakened the
coalition and possibly even the U.S. resolve.

Cutler believes it's likely that Saddam knows
he will lose Kuwait, but Saddam wants to have
the U.S. force him out in a ground war. That
way he will still be in power. ’

“This is where the U.S. faces a difficult
decision,” said Cutler. “We have to decide
whether to stop the war after [Saddam] is
forced out or to go all the way.”

Cutler served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi
Arabia from 1984 to 1987 and again from 1988
to 1989. He was appointed to serve as the
Carter administration’s ambassador to Iran in
1979, but because of deteriorating relations
between the United States and Iran he did not
take that post.

T hey ’re back...

Panthers knock off Seton Hall, stop three—garne slide

By Mike Rampa I -
Sports Editor

In a battle between two teams
headed in the wrong direction,
the Pitt Panthers went back to
what they do best last night and
rode their inside power game to
victory over Seton Hall, ending a
three-game losing streak and
beginning a “new season,” in
Coach Paul Evans’ words.

Seton Hall picked up its third
loss in a row and dropped to 13-
7 overall and 5-6 in the Big East.
Pitt improved to 16-7 (5-4).

The Panthers were powered

by Brian Shorter’s 22 points and
‘ﬁarelle Porter’s “almost” triple-
double. Porter ﬁnished uprwith
13 points, 12 boards and nine
assists. ‘

“We’ve talked to different
people about a leader taking
over, and I thought Darelle gave
us that tonight. He did a good
job defensively, made some shots
when we needed them and
rebounded very well. He did it
all,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.

In a surprising move, Evans
chose to start freshman guard
Ahmad Shareef in place of Jason

9 Matthews. Shareef said he knew

of the decision during the trip
back from California, but the
move was not officially
announced until yesterday.

According to Evans, Matthews’
past few sub-par games was the
reason for the lineup change.
Against UCLA, Matthews hit two
of four ﬁeld goals and no free
throws in only 16 minutes of
action.

“[Matthewsl didn’t have any

By Jim Lakely

animosity toward me,” Shareef
said. “We know he hasn’t been
playing the way he’s capable of
playing lately. Me and Jason are
good friends, and when he came
in, I told him to get his confidence
back, and everything would be
all right.”

Apparently everything was not
all right, however. Matthews did
not make any of his ﬁeld goals or
free—throw attempts in the first
half in his eight minutesof action.
In the second half, things didn’t
get much better- He was only
four of 12 from the ﬁeld, despite
nailing three of ﬁve three-pointers.

“lMatthews] certainly wasn’t too
good mentally tonight. He didn’t
play “very well in the first half,”
Evans said. ‘

The Pirates’ initially quick
transition game allowed Anthony
Avent, Terry Dehere and Gordon
Winchester to get behind the

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
Winchester power slam.

Panther defense for six quick
points on dunks. But Shareef
knocked down five points, and
Martin hit two consecutive baskets
to put Pitt up 11-10. After the
12:12 mark Pitt was ahead for the
rest of the half, occasionally up
by as much as seven points.
Halftime ended with Pitt up 40-
37.
Shorter hit for 14 during the
half and spent most of his time
posting up and guarding the
formidable Anthony Avent. Ave nt
wound up accounting for 23 of
the Pirates’ points, and along
with guard Terry Dehere the duo
combined to prodpce 60 percent
of Seton Hall’s points.

Not only did the two hit for 48
points, but they accounted for 41
of the Pirates’ 63 shots (65
percent), producing quite a
skewed shot distribution. The
closest Pirate was forward Gordon
Winchester, who took nine shots.

According to Shareef, Pitt was
well prepared for Avent and
Dehere’s offensive domination.

“We were practicing for it [two
days ago], and we were prepared
for where the shot/selection was
going to come from. It’s my ﬁrst
year guarding some key players,
and [Dehere] is one of the best
I’ve ever guarded. He and
[Providence guard Eric] Murdock
are the best in the Big "East,"
Shareef said.

The second half was all Pitt
after the 14-minute mark. The
Panthers never relinquished the
lead and at one point were up by
as much as 10.

l)ehere andAVent provide majority of offense as Hall falls

Staﬁ“ Writer

When two players combine for 48 points,
victory is almost assured, right?

Not if you play for Seton Hall.

Despite Terry Dehere’s 25 points and
Anthony Avent’s 23 points, the Pirates fell
to Pitt last night 86-80 in a sold-out
Fitzgerald Field House. Dehere and Avent

Stock 41 of Seton Hall’s 65 shots, a whopping

65 percent. Combined, they were
responsible for an astounding 60 percent
of the Pirates’ offense.

Every time Seton Hall came down the
ﬂoor, Dehere and Avent were working
free for the shot and taking it.

“We have set plays that we run,” said

Dehere, a 6-4 guard. “I work from the
outside, and Avent works from the inside.
We are not making a conscious effort to
have just me and Avent shoot the ball.
There are ﬁve men on the floor, and we
want to play it like a team.”

There might be five bodies on the ﬂoor
with Pirate uniforms, but all year Seton
Hall has been a two-man team. Thirteen
times, Avent and Dehere’s strong play has
been enough to post a win, but last night
it wasn’t enough.

“We played tough,” said Dehere, “but
just playing tough won’t get you a victory
in this league.”

In the Big East, victories and good
defense go together. Last night, Pitt’s
defense may not have stopped Dehere

and Avent, but it played tough enough to
win. ‘

“Pitt is a pretty good defensive team,”
said Dehere. “’Ihey are very physical and
have really big people inside. The guards
play a heady game every night, with Sean
Miller keying the whole game for them.

“Pitt’s guards have more experience
than any others in the league and are the
best defensively. On the inside they will
wear you down with [Brian] Shorter and
[Bobby] Martin."

Sure, the Panthers are tough on defense,
but are they the best in the league? What
about Georgetown’s famous pressing’
defense? According to Dehere, Pitt has the
edge over the Hoyas. ,

“Of course Georgetown has the the big

guys [Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo
Mourning] ﬁlling the lane, but I think Pitt’s
guards are a lot more physical than those
of Georgetown. That makes it tough to
move the ball around and get something
going offensively.”

“Pitt’s defense is as good as you will see
in the Big East,” said Avent. “They are not
going to give you anything easy. You are
going to have to work for every bucket.

“Tonight is was as hard as it will ever be
in the Big East. There is a lot of banging,
a lot of physical play.

"The refs, more often than not, are going
to let you play that way. Sometimes you
are going to get the call; sometimes you’re
not. You just got to keep playing."

Men’s indoor track squad boasts 61 best of [C44 qualifiers

9 By Greg Wallace

For The Pitt News

Members of the Pitt Men’s
Indoor Track team traveled to
Notre Dame this past weekend
for a meet with Notre Dame and
Michigan State and came away
with some impressive marks.

Several Panthers qualified for
the Eastern College Indoor
Championships (IC4A’s) in March.
Overall, coachjohn Vasvary was
pleased with the outcome, even

though his squad is a little banged
up.

“We had some real nice
performances out there,” Vasvary
said.

“We still have some nagging
injuries that are hurting us right
now. Hopefully, we can be back
by the (Big East) Conference meet.
It will be real important to have
everybody back.”

In the 55 meter hurdles, Pitt’s
Brett Shields took ﬁrst place in
the consolation ﬁnals with a time

of 7.40, the second best time of
his career. It was good enough to
qualify him for the IC4A’s.

“It was good to see him [Shieldsl
go out there and do that by
himself. He came back and ran a
good race. Brett is a lot stronger
looking now than he was last
year," Vasvary said.

Mike Formica ran his best time
of the year in the 3,000 meters
with a time of 8:19.20. He also
qualiﬁed for the IC4A’s.

“Mike looked good running

out there,” Vasvary said. “He's a
tough runner and he runs on
guts. He hangs in there and he is
running very well right now.”
Another IC4A qualiﬁer was
Jason Bodnar who chalked up a
time of 4:09.61 in the Mile Run
Invitational part of the meet, good
enough to earn sixth place. The
time topped Bodnar’s previous
best of 4:11.00.
Teammate Steve Forrester
ﬁnshed behind Bodnar with at
4: 16.77, also the best of his career.

Vasvary was also pleased with
the performance of Dave Senay
who registered a distance of 49
feet 3/4 inches in the shot put.
Senay is still recovering from
surgery on his left foot.

“Dave is really starting to come
back with the shot, ” Vasvary said.

The 69th Annual Eastern
College Championships will be
held from March 2-4 at Princeton
University. The event will feature
93 colleges from the eastern part
of the United States. I

straight goals to squeak ‘out the
victory.

Marino, who scored the game-
tying goal, said, “The power play
was the key. We moved the ball
well, got their defense moving
and got good outside shots.”
Marino scored three of his goals
with a man advantage, and he
added two assists in attaining his
second game MVP of the season.

Ski-racing
team looks

to Re gionals

By Brandy L. Simms
For T be Pitt News

It’s already two weeks into the
season, and the Pitt ski-racing
team is off and running.

At the season opener, heldjan.
19 and 20 at Seven Springs, the
women’s team placed ﬁrst in the
giant slalom on both days. It
marked the first time that has
happened since the team’s
inception four years ago.

“Our goal this year is to get to
the regionals,” said sophomore
Tina Negi. E

Senior Karen Helm finished in
first place on the first day and
placed second the following day.
During the two days of com-

Qpetition, the men’s team came in

fourth and
respectively.

Lastweekend the team traveled
to Tussey Mountain, located near
State College, Pa. Both the men’s
and women’s teams raced slalom,
and the results weren’t as
favorable this time around.

The women finished in sixth
and fifth places, respectively,
while the men finished in seventh
and eighth places. Erin DeSantis,
a freshman, was the Panthers’

third places,

top female competitor, ﬁnishing .

fourth and second during the two
days. Jason Jelovich and Rob
Alercon were the Panthers’ top
male finishers.

The team’ competes in the
Allegheny Collegiate Ski
Conference along with Bucknell
University, the University of
Pennsylvania, West Virginia
University, Pitt at Johnstown,
Westchester University, Kutztown
University, Dickinson College,

Juniata College, Indiana
University of Pennsylvania and
Carnegie Mellon.

The top four teams from each
conference go to the regionals,
where conference qualifiers race

against schools from the eastern .

seaboard.

Shorter even referred to Pitt’s
record as 1-0. '

Dehere knew what he was in
for before the night ever started.

“Any team that loses by 20 points
the last game is really motivated
for the next game. That wasn’t
the real Pitt against UCLA; they
are a much better basketball team,
as you can see tonight. They
came out and executed well down

the stretch, and that was the
difference tonight,” he said.

PIT!’ BITS: Pitt shot 46 percent
from the field for the game, 50
percent from three point range

percent from the ﬁeld, 27 percent
from three-point range and 78
percent from the ﬁeld. The Pirates
stepped to the free throw line
only twice in the first half, while

THE PITT NEWS APARTMENT GUIDE

Local groups work together to fight Oakland crime

By Virginia Brown

For the Pitt News

Several’ local institutions are working
together to make South Oakland safer for
students.

Lending a helping hand to these students
is the South Oakland Citizens Council, the
Student Government Board and the
Department of Public Safety.

Recently the SGB, in conjunction with
the SOCC and the Department of-Public
Safety, launched the Crime Stop program.
Crime Stop is a program through which
off-campus students and residents report
any crime or suspicious behavior to
Pittsburgh and campus police.

According to SGB President Brent
Saunders, Crime Stop is still in the
“experimental phase, with testing in the
200 block of Oakland Avenue and two
residence halls.”

The goals of this program are “to [study]
crime patterns in South Oakland and

_ develop a relationship between students

and residents, which has been pretty

hostile, in hopes that they become

friendlier,” Saunders said.

SOCC Director Patricia Scanlon foresees
a threefold benefit from the Crime Stop
program. “Students and the community
will be safer, and people can learn what
they can do to protect themselves and the

community and [learn] to build better

community relations between the
permanent residents and the temporary
residents,” she said.

‘ 

activities, the local police and the campus
police hope to detect crime patterns and
implement more patrols in these
troublesome areas.

The Department of Public Safety Offers

students information on how to make «

their apartments safer. According to
William Brennan, public safety director,
this information includes booklets and a
“check-off sheet to give off-campus
residents ideas of what they should be
concerned with and note them prior to
signing a lease.”

Brennan said that he would like to sit
down with Students and make them aware
of what is happening in their environment.
He said the Crime Stop program will be
beneficial for students because they will
now have access to information about
their neighborhoods and will be more in
tune with the things they need to do about
safety.

The city police also offers a service in
which a security adviser/Specialist comes
in and surveys an apartment free of charge.

“[A student] just needs to contact the city
police, and if the city won’t do [the survey],
then the Department of Public Safety will
do it, also free of charge,” said Brennan.

A student "who wishes to have this
service performed should contact the city
or the Department of Public Safety, which
will act as a liaison between the student
and the city. I

The SOCC and the Department of Public 

Safety both offer etching machines for
students to mark their property.

“It is important to mark personal
property, for itis the only way [students]
can get it returned to them if it is recovered
by the police. You wouldn’t believe the
amount of stuff that is recovered but can’t
be reclaimed since it hasn’t been marked,”
Scanlon said.

A safety committee sponsored by the
SGB is on the agenda for the fall term.

“The committee will eventually take
over Crime Stop, get or extend taxi and
shuttle services for students and be the
perfect place for students to ﬁle complaints,
such as poor lighting in an area they walk
in, and get something done about it,”
Saunders said.

Also upcomingifrom the SGB is a “stay-
safe guide,” a plan originally conceived of
by Michael Cohen, a former board member
and Saunders’ opponent in last year's SGB
presidential race. Saunders said, “It will be

a guide on how to prevent crime with a

\ little bit of safety.”
‘ L,’ Board member Andrew Gould is

currently working on this issue.

Scanlon’ said that many students often
risk personal safety when they host parties
and allow anyone to come into their
apartments. , L

“Property gets ripped off, and a guest
may actually be casing the joint,” she said.
“IStudents] walk around in glip-glip land
— totally oblivious if someone was
following them.”

Scanlon offered several safety hints for
students and others in the community:

0 Don’t buzz people into your apartment
building without actually knowing them;
they may not belong there. V

-Don’t open the door for a person
approaching a security building unless
you know him or her.

0 Be aware if you are being followed.FIf
you are, walk the other way.

°Be on the lookout for suspicious
behavior.

-Know your surroundings. Don’t take

shortcuts where criminals can lurk or

hide. "

-When approaching your automobile,
look at it carefully. Don’t park in out—of—
the—way places.

-Don’t leave the keys in your car for
that “one second” you have to run in to get
something.

-Don’t go to strange places that you’ve
never been to before.

-Don’t assume that you are safe in
pairs; many people who are in pairs are
talking and not really paying attention to
what is happening around them.

-If you step into an elevator and feel

Tenants rate Oakland ’s landlords

‘ The Pitt News
polled tenants of nine
area realties that rent to
students. The results of this
survey are presented in the
graph to the right.

For each of thefirst 14 questions,
the total number of responses for each
answer was divided by the total number
of responses to that question. The resulting
dividend was multiplied by 100 to arrive at a
ﬂat percentage rate for each answer to each
question.

These percentages were then multiplied by the
number of points assigned to its corresponding answer
score, creating a point value for each answer to each
question on the survey. The totals for each answer within each
question were totalled.

For example, in question number one, 79 students who rent from

A & R Building Co. responded. Eighteen of those 79 gave A 8: R a rating
of 5; 34 said 4; 21 said 3; 4 said 2; and 2 said 1. 18 divided by 79 is .228.
About 22.8 percent of the students who answered question one rated A & R
with a score of five.

This percentage is multiplied by 5, because the answer in question was a rating
of.5. The point value for .the number of 5's A & R earned from its clients for external
safety is 114. This same process was used to determine point values for the remaining
four answers to question one, and the ﬁnal point value rated by A & R for all of question
one is 378.5. The maximum score is 6,500. The total scores for the realtors surveyed
was: Meyers Management (60458), Pitt’s Office of Property Management (5487.5), H
8: P Associates (54442), Stephen A. Glickman Real Estate (5235.1), A & R Building Co.
(5125.5), John C. R. Kelly Realty, Inc. (48696), Oakland Village Realty (4411.0), Daran
Management Co., Inc. (43319) and Charles J. Greve & Co. (4203.4).

In calculating of the surveys, questions number 3 and 3a were omitted for purposes
of continuity.

questions individually.
Question 1. Describe the
interior safety of your apartment
’ (locks on doors, bars on windows,

Property Management said they considered
themselves safe from break-ins, and no one
said they felt unsafe. On the other hand, only 97
percent of tenants of Charles J. Greve & Co. said
they felt safe. 17 percent of tenants from Oakland
Village Realty and Daran Management Co, lnc., said they
felt safe.
Question 2. Describe the exterior safety of your apartment
(good lighting, fire escapes, security doors, etc.). Over 35 percent
of John C. R. Kelly Real Estate’s tenants surveyed felt safe when
approaching their apartment. 9
Meyers Management had a 31-percent approval rating for exterior
security. Greve was at the bottom, with less than 5 percent of those surveyed
stating that they felt safe.
Question 5. How accessible is your landlord? 80 percent of Meyers tenants
surveyed said the landlord was accessible 24 hours a day, while 17 percent of Oakland
Village Realty’s tenants surveyed said the landlord was virtually unreachable.
Question 9. Household pests (roaches, rats, etc.). 96 percent of Meyers tenants and
92 percent of H 8: P Associates tenants said there was no problems with pests. Oakland
Village’s tenants said their apartments were infested 22 percent of the time.
Question 13. Overall, I'd say my apartment is “a pleasant home away from home,”
said 95 percent of the Meyers Management tenants surveyed.
On the other end of the spectrum, Greve tenants rated those apartments below
average 36 percent of the time. -
Question 14. Overall, I’d say my landlord is above average, said 96 percent of
surveyed Meyers tenants, while approximately 66 percent of Greve tenants surveyed
rated the landlord as below average.

Parking
still scarce
on campus

By Michael J. Lowe
For The Pitt News

The cars move around the
streets of Oakland at a snail’s
pace, looking for something
that is not there.

“I hate to try and park down
here. It’s hard to find a space
available day after day,” said
Matt Robbins.

Parking is a severe problem
in the Oakland area. There
are some 15,000 commuting
students and 10,000 faculty
members at the University of
Pittsburgh, and only 4,243
parking spaces are available
in the six student and faculty
lots.

“The students can draw
their own conclusions,” Jan
Thomas, assistant director of
public safety and parking
administration, said.

The university has just
added an underground
parking lot at the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall,
but this still does not supply
the necessary parking places.
The city of Pittsburgh has
also renovated Schenley Plaza
to create more spaces for
parking, although not
everyone is pleased with the
changes.

“I thought it was going to
be bigger,” commuter Richard
Barton said.

Although parking is
inadequate, alternatives are
available. The university has
a ride-sharing program that is
available to anyone who lives
in the greater Pittsburgh area
and goes to school or work in
Oakland.

The program uses car— and
van—pooI matching to fit the
needs of the individual.
Students fill out a form in
which they give their name,
phone number and address.
The ride-sharing office can
then print up a list of people
in that area who are also
interested in car— and van-
pool matching.

If a match is made for a car
pool, it is up to the students
to make any further
arrangements, such as who
would drive and how the
costs would be shared.

“We could do a better job
if we had more students sign
up,” M. Kathleen Miller, the
program manager of UHCP/
Pitt Ridesharing, said.

Miller said the students
have too many reasons for
not signing up for the
program. To be able to
participate in the program,
students have to stay at the
university for the entire day.

The other alternative to
driving is to take the bus.
“There is nothing glamorous
about taking the bus, but it is
something that many students
have to do,” Miller said.

T uesday, February 5, 1991

By Rick Fellinger
For The Pitt News

When a semester either begins
or ends, it probably means that
it’s time for students to move into
or out of their apartments.

Sudents who don’t have access
to a van or pickup truck or who
want help with the hauling can
hire a moving service or rent a U-

 Haul.

The Yellow Pages and the
Donnelley Directory have many
listings of professional moving
services in the Pittsburgh area.
These businesses are licensed,
insured and have professional
movers working for them.

Some of them also offer their '

customers the option of either
moving their belongings or
packing and moving them.

This service doesn’t come
cheap. A move from Oakland to
'§hearby suburb such as Baldwin
or McKeesport costs around $50
to $70 per hour.

Parking —

Continued from page 6
Presently, there are nine U-Buses
that travel directly to the university
from nine suburbs around the
area. This allows for a quicker
trip to and from Oakland during
weekday rush hours.‘

However, most of the student
business that professional movers
get, according to Linda Vasko of
Mayﬂower Moving and Storage,
is from graduating seniors who
are relocating to a different city
or part of the country.

“Nine times out of 10,
companies who hired the students
out of college will pay for the
movers. Companies like IBM will
usually do this,” Vasko said.

For a cheaper moving service,

’ classiﬁed ads in most newspapers

sometimes have ads placed by
people who will help you move.

While these people are not

students get about the same type
of service. Rates for these movers
run aboug§g0 per hour, plus the
cost of gas.

An alternative for people who
don’t mind doing the heavy work
themselves is renting a U-Haul.
Jeff Shola, of U-Haul Rental
Service in Pittsburgh, said that it
does a “fair” amount of student
business. —

He said students can rent a U-
Haul near Pitt and then drop it off
at the end of the day near their
home. For a trip of about 45
minutes to an hour, a 10-foot U-

Haul would cost $24.95 per day »

plus 39 cents per mile, Shola said.

Fine dining...

Students can innovate to make quick meals

By Maureen Dorney
Sta1)"Wrlter

Keep it simple. “That is the
consensus on cooking in
student apartments.

“I’1l eat anything micro-
wavable,” said junior Scott
Shannon. He said he and his
roommates eat a lot of frozen
vegetables, chicken patties,
macaroni and cheese and pizza.

 

balanced meals a day. She said
students should stock up on
staples and buy foods such as
cereal, juice, peanut butter,
tuna fish, cheese, soup,
crackers, chicken and ground
meat.

Verdi recommended
buying a large package of meat
and separating it into a few
small packages for a couple of
meals, or boiling some noodles

“\V7z~. f\r‘fJ/‘:»r‘ »«\:>—v-r7/\ av lrx/sr~Q~9-..V,:,r~A

said Shannon.

Stay away from microwave meals, said Patty
Verdi, a registered dietician with the Student
Health Service. “You can get good nutrition if you
spend 45 minutes a day in the kitchen,” said
Verdi. If you eat the microwave meals, then you
save time but eat higher-calorie meals as a result.

Many of these meals get 30 percent of their
calories from fat. Eater3D1'gestrecommends meals
containing seven grams of fat and 500 milligrams

of sodium (salt). Lunch Bucket Chili with Beans ’

has 1,210 mg of sodium in its 8-ounce

lmicrowavable container. Oodles of Noodles, a

favorite among students, contains 20 grams of fat
and 2,060 mg of sodium. Even Weight Watcher
meals contain 38-percent fat.

Verdi recommends that students eat three

ﬂwﬁ/‘I 1‘».,»¢fmn. 319"‘. r*«.r\~~r~r\

some carrots and potatoes in a pan and cook it
in the oven for one hour. Easy.

There is no excuse not to cook if you have a
microwave, said Verdi. Sprinkle seasonings on
chicken, then cook it in the microwave for 10 to
15 minutes. Add a potato and frozen vegetables,
and you have a healthy, quick meal. If you need
help, then buy a cookbook, Verdi said.

Some simple food favorites of college students
are grilled cheese, Hamburger Helper, hot dogs,
Oodles of Noodles and hamburgers. Frozen
dinners, ﬁsh sticks, spaghetti, Campbell’s Souper
Combos and pizza also made the Top 10 list.

Pitt student John Lamb summed up what he
eats in one simple sentence.

“Whatever I can ,get [my] hands on is what I
eat,” he said.

Landlords are not. 

Tuesday,‘ February 5, 1991

always cooperative
with student needs

By Ross Pasquale
Stajf Writer

A variety of apartment-related
problems affect Pitt students who
rent in Oakland, and landlords
are not always cooperative in
solving these problems.

Graduate student Vicki
Langerman rents a parking space
in her North Oakland building’s

K/AIL, may AIL}. i11'\..i1\J.1Jd3I'\LakL L.lA\.,lb
with Langerman’s knowledge.
Langerman was not home but
allowed her friend to use her
parking space. Her friend’s car
was going to be towed without
Langerman’s knowledge.

“They were very rude. [My
friend] was crying. Iwasn’t even
there. They made her pay $75 to
not tow it,” said Langerman.

“They could have tried to reach
me first before towing the car. I
am the owner of the parking
space; they should have tried to
reach me," she said.

Langerman talked to her
landlord, but he blamed the
incident on the towing company.
Langerman has withheld $75 from
her rent and refuses to pay it —
ever

“It was a football weekend.
They were just trying to make
money,” she said. “He invoked
the name of God to cover for his
inadequacies.”

Despite this problem she has
received help from her landlord
on another occasion: He had
Langerman’s apartment sprayed
for cockroacheswhen she made

1 her request.

Kris Overholt, another graduate
student, was without security or
lights in the hallways of her South

Oakland building when her
landlord did not pay his electric
bill.

Without electricity, the
intercoms at the outside door did
not work.

The hallways were dark, and
tenants had to use ﬂashlights to
find their way in and out of the
building at night.

Junior Emily Crow experienced

1)lLlU1lL1l&,lu ciljdl tlllLi11L.

The front door didn’t shut, so
the landlord shaved the bottom
of the door to make it close.
However, the door remained
broken.

Plaster was falling from her
living-room ceiling, and water
was falling from her bathrooniﬂ
ceiling. There was a crack in the
plaster of her living—room wall.
Her kitchen light was broken.
She called her landlord many
times to fix these problems but
without success.

“I eventually worked it out by
sending him a list of complaints
with my rent check. I continually
called and sent lists for three
months before he helped me,”
said Crow.

Senior Chris Vates’ landlord
replaced his stove four times
before a working one was

installed. His windows and wall L

both leak as well.
“Apparently, they built a wall
over a window,” said Vates.
“The security door is broken,
so people solicit all the time. In
all fairness, it’s nicer than most
off-campus housing I've seen,”
he added. “I’ve seen mu ch worse.
You do have to call six times to
get a response lthoughl,” Vates
said.

Tenants must understand lease to avoid conflicts

By Mike Hudson
Stajf Writer

When it comes to apartment
hunting, the old adage, “Let the
buyer beware,” may be more
appropriately phrased: “Let the
renter beware.” This word of
caution is aimed toward those
who are pondering the idea of
seeking off—campus
accommodations.

Jumping into a lease agreement
without understanding all the
terminology and responsibilities
involved may cause more
problems than expected.

After students determine how
much they can spend and what
type of apartment they’re willing
to settle for, they should learn
about leases. .

A lease agreement is a legally
binding contract designed to

‘protect both the lessee (tenant)

and the lessor (landlord).
The lease can either be written

\

“fit

or oral. The Commuter Resource

..C.<?-.n.t€=.r.. . and the . Off-Campus
Housing Service offer students
the following information about
leases.

The lease provides specific
details such as length of time the
property will be rented (usually
six to 12 months; however, nine—
month leases are available for
college students), what utilities

 Q. are included with the rent and a

schedule of payments. Leases vary
from landlord to landlord, so it is

T important to read and understand 1

all terms of the lease before
signing it.

Always get the lease agreement
in written form, since oral leases
tend to be ambiguous and often
lead to disagreements between
renter and landlord.

If there are any questions or
doubts about what is expected of
the tenant, ask the landlord to
explain. If the landlord_ can’t
explain, don’t agree to that portion
of the lease.

Understanding your rights as a
renter will enable you to avoid
future problems with your
landlord and save you
unnecessary aggravation.

Tenants have the right to “quiet

, enjoyment.” This means the right
to peaceful possession of the
PYOPCTIY

A landlord must respect a
tenant’s privacy. The landlord
cannot make unannounced

. inspections, lock a tenant out of
his or her apartment, shut off
utilities without reason or
appropriate notice or wrongfully
evict the tenant.

Tenants have the right to sue
their landlord for damages if they
feel that their rights have been
violated.

A landlord cannot evict tenants
for exercising their legal rights.

Tenants cannot withhold rent
if repairs to the property are not
done to their satisfaction.

Withholding rent can be grounds
for eviction.

Tenants can file a formal
complaint with the County Health

Department if they feel that the

on campus. A list of banned

agencies was not available upon
request.

All landlords listed with the
OCHS are required to sign a non-
discriminatory agreement. This is
to ensure that the agency is‘
operating in accordance with the
Fair Housing Law of Pennsylvania
-— which maintains that it is illegal
for property owners and real-
estate agents to refuse to sell or
rent property because of a
person’s sex, race, religion, color
or nationality.

“The office is a self-service
center where [students] do the
work,” said Beth Anne Pell, a full-
time employee at the center.

Anyone affiliated with the
university — graduate or
undergraduate students, faculty,
staff at university hospitals or
parent organizations and students
at the Pittsburgh Art Institute —- is

eligible to use the service. g

Usually students find a suitable
apartment in two days to a week.
Pell said the length of time it
takes to find an apartment
depends on the individual and
his or her expectations. “You
can’t be discouraged,” Pell said.

About 87 to 90 percent of
interested students using the
service find off-campus housing,
according to Pell.

Over 2,400 students visited the
office last year.

There are about 500 apartments
currently listed, but Pell said the
summer months are the busiest
and there are usually about 2,500
apartments available on the lists.

The center stressed that it does
not approve or inspect the
apartments listed, and they are
by no means the only ones
available. All the information is
provided by the landlords.

According to Lori Pack, a
student working at the Resource
Center, you should wait until
March or April to look for an
apartment for next fall or even
this summer. Lori said,” That’s
when the realtors and landlords
know what they’ll have available
and call the center. Students with
apartments don’t think about
summer subletting until then
either.”

Pack said realtors often leave
unavailable apartments on the
listings so that students will call
their offices. “They’ll tell [students
the apartments] are already taken,

' but that they have something else

available. Don’t count on a place,”
she said.

In addition to the Off—Campus
Housing Ofﬁce, the Commuter
Resource Center provides a notary
public, runs a ﬂower service called
the Petal Pusher and is a Bell of
Pennsylvania payment center.
