Matt Swetonic, feature editor and columnist for The

which he attacked the fraternitygsystem.

In the special session, held before the actual meeting
was called to order, Art Pape, president of the council, asked

S U Schedules Controversial Film

‘Operation Correction’

By IVIATTHEW NESVISKY
The Student Union Forum Series will present “Opera-
tion Correction,” a. ﬁlm rebuttal of the controversial movie
“Operation Abolition,” tomorrow at 2 pm. in the SU Supper

Room.

Dr. Henry H. ‘Foster of the Law School will lead a dis-
cussion following the ﬁlm. He will also introduce Miss Jane

O’Grady, who participated in the.“

San Francisco riots which are the
subject of the movie.

, “Operation Abolition,” which
was shown at the University last
May, is the story of the student
demonstrations at the House Un-
American Activities hearings in
San‘ Francisco in the spring of
1960.

Charges Instigation

Released by Washi.ngton-Video
Publications and sponsored by the
Aluminum Company of America,
“Operation Abolition”
to show that the rioting students
were motivated to their actions. by
agroup of Communists who plot-
ted to disrupt investigations into
Red‘ activities in" northern cali-
fornia.

“Operation Correction.” the
film to be shown tomorrow, has
— the same scenes as “Operation
Abolition,” but with a different
sound track. The new commen-
tary explains that the college
students in the picture were not
moved by Communists but by
their own principles.

Dr. Foster will comment on the
20-minute movie, and Miss
O’Gi-ady will also address the
audience. Both speakers will an-
swer questions on the student
rioting.

The President’s Plan for the reorganization of,
Student Government is, in effect, the expression
of “a desire for a more effective body to communi-

Opinion

By MARILYN EIGES

Repres.Proposal

The Representative Plan is based on the belief
that “no plan of government is perfect and that it
will therefore, be subject to change due to the
maturation of the body it represents and the ideas

which were unani- /

The framers of this plan. realize that “the pur-
pose of a student governing group is not, in the
true sense of the word, one of governing. Instead,
a student government is an organ of communica-
tion, an instrument of service, and a source of re-
flection for student opinion.”

Bearing these ideals in mind this group has en-
dorsed the following President’s Plan for Reorgani:-A
zation of Student Government.

‘Senate-like Body’

Proposed: That the student governing body of
the University of Pittsburgh shall be a senate-like
body, consisting of:

A. Four officers, which shall be called the presi-
dent, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer,

(Continued on Page 3)

 

Students go to the polls Wednesday to decide the future of Stu-
dent Government on this campus. To get an ielea of the trends to
be expected in the voting, various campus leaders and heads of cam-
pus organizations were questioned as to which plan they would back.

The position of the SU Board. was stated by Sheila Rinne in a

"letter to The Pitt News.

“The President’s Plan,” Miss Rinne wrote, “would institutionalize
the cooperative thinking and actions of all major organizations and
groups, as well as include the Presidents of every school in the
University.”

‘ Urges Adoption

“We feel very strongly that such a grouplwill serve as a
stimulus to our campus, provoking much thought and discussion,” the
letter concluded, “aswell as constructive, cooperative action among
all interests, and we urge all students to vote for its adoption.”

within the representative body.” _

The plan’s framers considerit “no more than
three amendments designed to improve the basic
structure in which we continue to have faith.”

The amendments cover two areas considered to
be “weak”; student representation and the oiﬁce of
the President of Student Government.

Class System Inadequate

They feel that: the class system of representa-
tion, in the case of the majority of the senators in
the present Student Government, does not ade-
quately form a true basis of representation:

A. It lacks any real formal structure, due es-.
pecially to the advent of the trimester plan.
B. The schools of the University have a definite
structure that is constant from year to year.

which shall be nominated by the members of
this senate-like body and by a plurality of
votes in a student-wide election.

. Seven presidents of existing governing bodies
in the following areas: V
Men’s Council, governing ‘all University’ men.
Associated Women Students, governing all
University women.

Interfraternity Council, governing all frater-

nity men.

Pan-Hellenic Council, governing all sorority
women. ’

Men’s Dorm Council, governing all men resid-
ing in dorms. '

Women’s Dorm Council, governing all women
residing in dorms.
‘Student Union Board,
Union activities.

Six presidents of cabinets which shall repre-
sent the schools of "the University:
Engineering and Mines Cabinet

Business Administration Cabinet

Pharmacy Cabinet

Nursing Cabinet

Liberal Arts Cabinet

Education Cabinet .

These seventeen persons would be responsible
to represent the entire undergraduate student body
in matters of legislation and coordination among
the various student groups and organizations.

Committees for Events

In addition to these above mentioned personnel,
there would be a number of standing committees
which would operate in conjunction with the gov-
erning body mentioned above. . These committees
would be responsible for such activities and events
as:

Orientation, Homecoming Day, Tap Day, Parents’
Weekend, Freshman Handbook, The Book Ex-
change, Pep Committee, Pitt Chest, Foreign Stu-
dent Programming, and Human Relations.

The organizations and cabinets represented by
presidents on the senate body would also conduct
the events which they have traditionally held,
such as:

 ate the affairs of the student body.

Rcpres.Proposal

(Continued from Page 1)

C. Therefore, a cabinet structure such as that
presently used by the School of Engineering
would insure greater contact with all students.

Proposed: that the schools of Liberal Arts, En-
gineering, Business Administration, Education,
Pharmacy and Nursing receivetwo votes per 500
students or a total of 20 senators since there are

approximately 5000 students in the undergraduate

student body. .
Senate Can’t Coordinate
They also feel that the Senate is unable “to be
a truly coordinating body and one that can help
in carrying out the services and policy of the seven
other major governing bodies here at the Uni-
Versity.”
Proposed: that the seven organizations re-
, ceive a seat in the Senate to be ﬁlledby the vice-
president of that organization. This would in-
clufa AWS, IFC, Men’s Council, Men’s
Residence Hall Council, Pan—I-Iellenic Council,

Student Union Board and Women’s Residence
Hall Council.

This, they feel, would “broaden the Senate’s
base to recognize its responsibility as a coordinat-
ing body concerned with the specific problemsand
programs of the other governing bodies and allow
it, in the future, to form an extremely effective line
of communication with the student through the es-
tablishment of cabinets.”
Suggest Amendments
In the second area of concern, they believe that
the office of the President of Student Government
can be improved through two amendments.’
. Proposed: that the president of Student Gov-
ernment not be permitted to hold any major
office in any other organization, the office of
president being a full-time job.

Proposed: that the president attend all Senate
meetings. The president should be aware not only
of the results of the Senate meetings, but also why
decisions have been made.

Give Credits

A third amendment, proposing that the Presi-

dent be granted three credits under a leadership

 

7

course guided by the Political Science Department,

was dropped due to the difficulties which would be
involved.

Framers of the Representative Plan consider
the major difference between their idea and the
President's Council Plan as one of the balance of
power. , --~ ‘

“In the President’s Plan, the balance of power
lies with,the presidents of the seven major organi-
zations rather than on the student body; as it does

in the Representatives Plan.

Steve Johnson, president of
Men’s Council: “I cannot speak
for ‘Men’s Council as a whole,
but for myself, I feel that of the
two, the President's Plan is very
much the better. If SG is to do
its job well, it must be done in
a small group with diplomatic
channels. It cannot operate as it
is run: now.”

Mary. Lou Karges, president of
AWS,dwas unable to say which
plan AWS would back, but she
went along with the President’s
Plan. :

.WPGH Backs Representatives

According to Nate Firestone and

. Dick Rauh of WPGH, it is the
_l decision of their Student Execu-
;‘ tive Board to back the Reaves’-

Slotkin Plan. Reasons for this de-
cision will be given in an editorial
delivered on the station tonight at
8:55 p.m. and again at 10:55 pzm.

Ina Amdur, president of Mor- A
' tar Board, declined to comment,

saying she was not fully enough
acquainted with the proposals.

The stand of IF Council was re-
ported by President Art Pape who
declared; “IF Council will not
state a preference now. They sup-
port fully whichever plan is de-
cided’ by the referendum.”

Falk Favors SG

James Falk, President of Young
Republicans, declared that neither
he nor the organizatioii was back-
inga particular plan. However, he
stated, “An SG is definitely a: good

thing. I would be in favor of any

‘plan which would give us a good

SG.”

Alvin Resnick, President of.
Druids, stated: “Our organiza-
tion contains members of both
factions, therefore I do not feel
qualiﬁed to comment at this
time.’.’ .

Howard Harawitz, President of

SANE, declared that an SG can.

only work well when there is close
communication between the mem-
bers of the SG and the entire stu-
dent body. For this reason he
backed the President’s Plan which
provided for the heads of campus
organizations, to one or another
of which almost all students be-
longed, to form the nucleus of the

Pitt’s student body has the opportunity to be one of

ithetﬁrst ever to remove its student -governing organiza-
ip tion. It’s an opportunity that shouldn’t be missed.

Under the proposed reorganization plans, SG cannot
serve any useful function at this University because of the
lack of faith in the primary purpose~..of such an organiza-
tion by administrators, senators, and students. With this

basic fact in mind, we urge that each student markrhis

ballotin the “no” column this Wednesday. Neither of the
proposed plans can overcome these obstacles, nor do they
try. ~ '
The Representative’s Plan calls only for “a coordinating
body which will help carry out the duties and functions of
other organizations.” If an executive and 20 to 50 mem-
bers of a group cannot carry outiits functions, it seems
doubtful that SG would be any more successful, -especially
if it is concerned with the 143 other organizations on cam-

fpus. And if the groups canfdo their duty, then one of SG?s
amajor promises has -‘just been wipedzout. It's working at half
-strength before it even starts. ‘

.The-President’s Council Plan realizes‘ that “. . . the

body which now calls itself a student government is not-’

and will‘ not become a body exercising power, either‘ over
students or in inﬂuencing administrative action . . . At
best, fS,G can recommend action on the part of the admin-
istration.” If such a_ voice crying in the wilderness has no
hopes of being heard,‘what’s- the use of crying?

In the third place, until many administrators and“ sen-
ators alike realize that SG can be more than just a body

‘constructed to appoint major events chairmen or to act as.

messenger boy between students and administrators, it
will be able to do little more than that.

To be effective, a student must believe that SG is a pow-
erful organization and do something about it. Such was the

lease at‘ the University of Connecticut where a senate-

initiated suit was filed against the university in order to
regain control of organization budgets. In an out-of—court
settlement, the university granted the senate complete con-

trol over such funds for the remainder of the year when the

case will be renewed. .
The likelihood of a similar action occurring onthis

campus seems doubtful when it is considered that the ad-

ministration would never listen to seven presidents (or vice

presidents) from major organizations clamoring for ‘budget

control no matter how many" ways they are reorganized.
We propose a “no” vote in the coming referendum in

order to abolish SG until students themselves feel the need

for such an organization and are willing to work for it.

A Lesson in Journalism . .:

Newspaper Publicity

\

,_ (Editor's note: The editorial board feels that
Mr. Nelson’s views adequately express l general
newspaper policy adhered to by The Pitt News.)

Last week after Matt Swetonic’s comments on
fraternities were printed in The Pitt News, a
friend of mine stopped me while I was going into
the cafeteria, slapped me pm the back, and with a
smirk commented, “Well, The Pitt News has done
it again!” He said that he could not understand
howl could hold» such an opinion of the fraternity
system. .

This upset ,me. I calmly ex-
plained that while I agreed with
some of Mr. Swetonic’s state-
ments, his conclusions and opin-
ions are widely different from
mine. i, ‘

The‘ next question was, “Then
if all the people of The Pitt .-
News do not believe in the
things on the editorial page, why
are they printed?” This type of
question and many other per-
sonal criticisms indicated that the student body of
this University needs a short lesson in journal-
ism to prevent this generalization from occurring
again.

The editorial page of a newspaper is different
from all other parts of the paper because it is the
only page where the opinions. of the writer may
be expressed. There is some question that this
policy is always achieved because the reporter
shows his opinion by his selection and judgment of
facts and order in a. news article. This cannot be
helped, as the judgment of news-worthiness varies
from person to person. Unbiased writing is, how-
ever, the attempted goal. ﬂ
Editorial, Page Comments

A feature writer inserts his opinion into a
feature story by the tone he uses. The editorial
page is the designated place for comments on cur-
rent news and happenings pertinent to the student
body. W '

i The editorial, contrary to popular opinion, is
always written by the same person, the editor—in-

 

By Jim Nelson

chief. The editor does not sit down, vent his per-
sonal opinions and send them off to press. Writing
editorials requires much thought and planning.
First the editor must survey all news to be printed
and decide what is the most important issue that
should receive comment. After collecting necessary
infdigpiation, statistics and ideas, he then writes
the editorial. Before it is printed, theeditorial is
read and discussed by the editorial board and im-
portant corrections and revisions are made.

vi-

The editorial does not in any way‘ attempt toikz.

reﬂect student opinion. It is not the opinion of
anyone but the editor and his staff. Theleditorial
is an interpretation and criticism of the news from
the point of view of the editor. A newspaperitakes
stands through itsieditorials, but the opinions ex-
pressed are not always those ofrevery single per-
son associated with theinewspaper. ’
A column is NOT an editorial, A column can
be anything under the sun, from poetry ‘to com-

» ments on current events, either within or without

the University. _ A column represents only the
opinions of the particular columnist writing them‘,
and in no way reflects the opinions of the news-
paper or anyone else. All columns are reviewed
by the editor but are criticized on the basis of the

logic of the argument‘ presented and not on they_.§,

conclusions formulated.
Columnist Views Issues -

A columnist is chosen because he has shown a
keen interest in a variety of ﬁelds and can write
intelligently about them. His opinions are not al-
ways the best, but they are his point. of View and
often bring to light a criticism or comment that
had not been thought about in current issues. He
-has the ability to stand away from the problem ‘
and see it without the strong bias of those direct-
ly involved. . F A

Letters to the Editor are a major place for stu-
dent opinion. They include valid corrections’ of
news articles that have recently been published
and comment or criticize columns and editorials.

While I realize that this column has covered agc

limitedAarea ‘of newspaper policy, I hope that it
will help readers understand the editorial page not
only of The lfitt News but newspapers in general.

Reading The Author . . :

w

  An Unfortunate Trend .

The Book Center recently made a signiﬁcant
change in the arrangement and display of a large
portion of its merchandise. The highly popular
ﬁrst ﬂoor section of modern and classical literat-
ture, which had previously been grouped.accord-
ing to publisher, is now sectioned according to
authors. The result is that," regardless of the size,
binding. or price range of the
volumes, all the available works
of a particular writer are bunch
ed together.

In business primarily to ‘sell
books, the Center probably had:

 

the change. For the move illu .
strates a most unf6rtun.ate-tzzeadg

book—buying'public: people read
authors instead of "books.

This trend is unfortunate for
several reasons. The jﬁrst is concerned with estab-
lished writers and our attitudes toward them.

From the starry-eyed Freshman to the gocktail
party intellectual',‘too many people are preoccu-
pied with who they read rather than what they
read. Today, for example, one must be up on his
Joyce, Proust, Faulkner and Eliot, and if.he’ does
not know the ﬁrst six hours of ‘Bloom’s day by
heart, well, he simply rates a G’ grade in life.
Don't Mark Twain

Added to this problem is the fact that many
people belieize that all the world's great literature
has already been written. “Read nothing but clas-
sics!” Mark Twain once said. The witty riverboat
captain, however, seems ajbit sho§rt—sighted to me:
if everybody had listened to him,I then who would
have ever read Twain’s work? I '

And'the fact remains, shocking though it may
be, that not everything written by a great writer
is great. Indeed, some of whom Ewe consider our
greatest , writers have’ turned out some of the
world’s most ‘fragrant garbage.  A 

pErnest Hemingway for example

 

won .311 ‘the

literary, prizes with The Old Man and the Sea, but

but when he went Acrbss the ‘River and into the)‘

Trees he should have stayed there. John ‘Steinbeck
proved himself a master when he published The

_ Grapes ‘of Wrath, but he really got rerouted on

The Wayward Bus. Somerset Maugham made lit,-
erary history with Of Human Bondage, but with
The Razor’s Edge, he only made money. We re-
member Eugene O’Neill for The Hairy Ape, but
who has even heard of The Dreamy mlfiid, much
less read it? And while Edgar, Allan Poe made a
name for himself when he wrote The Raven, he
merely made a fool of himself when he penned
‘_‘. . . And my soul was a stagnant tide/Till the
fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing
bride.” p ’
So. it can be seen that selecting one’s reading

according to authors rather than individual works_)...

can cause an inexcusable wasteof time, effort and

.money on the part of the reader. But there is‘
‘still one more aspect to, this unfdrtpnate trend

in the selection of reading matter.

Public Fears ‘New Voice‘
This is reﬂected in the difficulties which are

. the inherent lot of the “struggling young writer”

in vthis country. One of the main reasons he is
forced .-to struggle so much ‘is because nobody
wants to have anything to do with him. The
public is afraid to invest its time and money in ‘a
new, unrecognized voice and, therefore, publishers
are reluctant to publish them. The writer is stuck
with spending more time in selling his work than
creatihg it and the public wallows in the “security”
of famous—name. authors. a is V

The unfortunate trend of readingauthors in-

stead of books, it can be seen, has several badzéil

side affects. The reader suffers through ‘his narrow-
ness by drifting into an intellectual stagnation,

President's Plan

Editor, The Pitt News:

At last 'I:uesday’s meeting of the
Men's Dormitory Council, the
members were privileged to hear
both reorganization proposals for
our Student Government . . . .

Neither plan offered a ‘better

‘ voice by the student in the affairs

of SG except that Slotkin said he
has enough faith in the student
body of Pitt that they will vote
more conscientiously in the future
than they had in the past,_ there-
by assuring a better and more
representative senate . . .

But with his planvwe run into
the same problem we had before:
a top-heavy senate. Twenty-seven
people are just too many to work
as the close unity they would have
to if they were to become a strong
organization ‘again. .

Rich Sobota’s»proposal is a fa

better idea in my opinion and also
it is the first new approach to the
problem that we have had. '
, Slotkin says that the average
student would not have enough
representation under Sobota’s
plan. Would the average student.
have any more representation
under Slotkin’s plan than he had
before? NO! So we might as well
just have a stronger, organization-
al structure here at‘ Pitt.

What we need is a new system‘

like Rich Sobota has ‘offered us.

Wallace's Defense.

Called ‘Inadequate’

Editor, The Pitt News: ,
Although not a fraternity man,
I feel that Mr. Wallace did an in-
justice to all fraternities with his
entirely inadequate defense of the
fraternity system. '
I would be very disillusioned’ if

,1 were to ﬁnd that the most im-
portant role of the fraternity men

is Greek Week, the construction
of ﬂoats, the decoration of house-

fronts, etc . . . . Without house-.

fronts, ﬂoats, etc., I’m sure we

ywould all be left with a deep"

sense of loss, but the world would
still go around.

I can’t see why. Mr. Wallace
objects to the use of the" terms
“social brotherhood” and “social
organization” as applied to fra-

Letters to the Editor must

ternities. I think it shouldibe ad-
mitted that fraternities are social
primarily and that their -true pur-
pose is to provide the social edu-
cation necessary for the liberally
educated man.

I have questioned many pleges
in the past as to why they pledg-

ed, but _I never found one who
pledged so that he could “unself-
ishly seek to advance his brothers

‘in the arts of life, etc.”

It seems to me, however, that
fraternities are not doing all in
their power tobring about the
social development of their mem-
bers. For example the individual
fraternities could tear down the
religious and racial barriers’ to
brotherhood. The fraternities as a
single group could exert their in-
ﬂuence in tearing down the unjust
and totally unnecessary color bar-
rier that exists in the Tuck Shop.

By turning. their energy from
“Marathon Monopoly” to projects
such as these, fraternitiesewould
be stepping upthe social develop-

’ment of notonlytheir members,

but the members of the whole
campus communityccas well. This is
an, important role and the fratern-

ities should play it.-

‘Fraternity Man Blasts

Column by Swetonic

Editor, The Pitt News. >

Being a fraternity man I could
not help but take offense with the
columniwritten by Matt Swetonic
in the January 29 issue of your
paper.

cpl am the first to admitthat fra-
ternities are not perfect. There are
many things that can be said
against them, but Mr. Swetonic
failed to mention any of them.

Instead heused weak examples ‘

and large over-generalizations to
prove his basic premise that fra-

uals and thus do not live up to
their ideals . . .

the inference that association with
Jews will stunt one’s. individuality.

If. that is whatis meant then I
believe these New York'Jews can
better develop themselves by tak-
ing into their fraternity Italians

‘ from. Lancaster and Protestants

from Cleveland as my fraternity
has done.
all can only think‘ of one of the

"rules you have for your “Letters

to the Editor” section. It reads,
“Letters containing obvious mis-
statements or lacking in good taste
and fair play will be rejected.” It

would not be a bad idea to put‘

this same ruleto use for the col-
umns you print. If it were, I be-
lieve that Mr. Swetonic’s column
would never have made it to the

, RING IN THE NEW _
Are you still writing ‘_,‘196l” on your papers and letters‘? I'll
bet you are, you scampsl But I am not one to be harsh with
those who forget we are in a. new year, for I myself have long
been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in -my senior year at
college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of
1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such ‘a serious
error because, as we all know, 1874 was. later repealed by
President Chester A. Arthur in a ﬁt of pique over the Black

Tom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came

to regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous
meeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.
Arthur said, “_Lou, I wish I_ha.dn’t of repealed 1874." Where-

upon the French emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi o

que -nous et tyler in.” Well sir, they had many a good laugh
about that, as you canimagine.) ' _

But. I digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our
papers and letters‘? Well sir, the best way is to ﬁnd something
memorable about 1962, something unique to ﬁx it ﬁrmly in
your mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,

, 1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and

by 7. Take 3. pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962
divided by 4 is 490-1 / 2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2 / 7.This mathe-
matical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but

Physics Department To Host
High School 0 Science Majors

Approximately 100 science majors. from high schools in
Allegheny County will be guests of the University’s Physics

Department Saturday.

The students will spend the day, touring various labor-'
atories where members of the Physics Department will give
demonstration lectures. They will meet at Old Mellon In-
stitute at 9:15 am. 9

One of the laboratories they will

visit is the Nuclear Physics labor-

atory where a 47-inch cyclotron
will be operated to produce radio-
active substances. The students
will also_ View the operation of
automatic recording Geiger coun-
ters and scintillation spectro-
meters.
Measures Collisions

In the Atomic Physics labora-
tory, accelerators will be used t:o
produce protons and atomic hy-
drogen beams. The collision be-
tween these particles, which is
very similar to that which occurs
in the upper atmosphere, will then
be mea-sured.

A motion picture which ex-

plains how the principles of x-
ray crystallography are applied
in the ﬁelds of solid state phys-
‘ics, structural chemistry, - and
bio-chemistry, will be shown in
the X-Ray Crystallography lab-
oratory.

The superconductivity of metals
that have‘ been cooled by liquid
helium to 450 degrees below zero
will be demonstrated in the low
temperature laboratory.

The students will then be given
a chance to view some of the ex-

All state and volunteer rehabili-

contacted to provide the names,
ages, numbers and types of dis-
abled persons in Logan County.
From this group a sample will be
taken to determine the need for
rehabilitation services in the
County. 9

Evaluates Services

The sample will be used to
learn the types of rehabilitation
’ services available, the beneﬁts
these services render, the types
of jobs disabled persons hold, and
what’ additional services these
persons may require. ,

Employment agencies and in-
dustrial and business ﬁrms will
be contacted by the researchers
to determine the problems ex-
isting in the employment of -the
handicapped.

The team also plans to study
the drain on Logan County’s eco-
nomic resources resulting from
support of non—rehabilitated, dis-
abled persons now receiving al-
lotments from veterans’ groups,

Captain Wirz is a Confederate

a couch in the courtroom.

Says Galuppi of his role: “If I
am guilty of the crimes charged
to me, then all of mankind is

some kind of super human being
to ward off the instructions of his

Controls Student
Behavior Problems

By KAREN HALPERT

"What visitors see when they
ﬁrst walk in the door of the Ca-
t.hedral of Learning is often the
jmpression they carry with them
of the University, so we try to

one,” said Joseph Hedgesh head
marshall of the University.

As Head Marshall, ‘or ‘Campus
Proctor, Hedges takes care of all
student behavior problems. Along
with his assistant hevreminds stu-
dents to put out cigarettes or to
take their lunches to’ the Tuck
Shop when they have forgotten to
observe these campus rules. ~

“We have asked students notto V

smoke, particularly not in the na-
tionality rooms or the commons
room,” says Hedges, “because not
only does it annoy students who
are studying and create a bad im-
pression for visitors, but we have

ﬂoors have been damaged by the

Commons‘ Room Burns

In the 14 years ,that he has
been" with the University, Hedges
has had a number of interesting
experiences. “I remember once
when we received a phone call
saying that the Commons Room
was on fire,” Hedges recalled. “We
dashed madly up only to ﬁnd that
the prankster had been referring
to our ﬁreplace.”

There have also been cases
where Hedges has been asked to
locate a student in class to tell
him that his wife was having a
baby. *

Hedges is also a member of the

“I have worked with young

people many years,” said Hedges; '

“I lﬁnd that on the whole, most
students are helpful and co—op-
erative, and I particularly enjoy
seeing them when they return to
the University to visit. with ‘us
after they have graduated and en-
tered their various professions.”

“I ﬁnd it almost ‘unbelievable
that a young student that I had
known just a few years before
will come to visit me as an esta-
blished doctor or teacher and in-

Journalism
Seminars

A Scheduled

Instructors Stress,
Research, Analysis
Of Individual Projects
By JACKI KATZ
Requirements for the two
journalism seminars offered
this -trimester have sent stu-
dentshunting for Tito’s
speeches and l\/Ii1ton’s. Areo-
pagitica.
cThe seminars are taught by
Daniel Marder. Marder is taking
the place of Avery Bernhard for
this trimester only. Mrs.«Bernhard

has taken a leave of absence due
to illness.

Other courses offered by the
University in journalism are “Ar-
ticle Writing,“ “Types of Journal-
istic Writingﬁ.’ “History of Journ-
alism and Writing the Scientiﬁc.
Paper.” There is no longer a

 journalism major offered.

According to Dr. W. George

' Crouch, chairman of the English

Department, “The journalism ma-
jor was merged with the writing

in order to encourage the student-

‘to know some journalism and to
have an introduction into all ﬁelds
of writing.”

In\the seminars the students
do individual and special work.
-One. student, Sheila Mallinger,
is studying public relations. She
has established a. hypothetical.
company and ﬁgured the public
relation policy for that com-
pany. ‘

Methods of writing different
types of reports are studied in
“The Writing of the Scientific

' Paper" and “Typ_es of Journal-
istic Writings,” according to
Murder. 4 ‘

Another, Lou Safko. is working
on a long series of articles of
analysis on the same topic, Tito.

, In other seminars, the student
studies news practices. Three
main attitudes of this seminar are:
the practice of applied journalism,
the study of historical aspects of
press relationships. and research
in American and international
papers.

Most of these courses will again
be offered during the fall tri-
mester. Mrs. Bernhard said the
department hopes to expand the
courses offered. '

éandng Sparks Swimmers 
Vivtory Over NYU, 55-41,)

By LENBERENFIELD A
Performing with the mechanical efficiency of an armored

tank, the Panther swimmers copped their fourth victory of

the season at the Carnegie Tech pool last Saturday, as they
rolled over Uew YorklUniversity, 55-40.

‘ The Pitt squad continued to crack swimming records as

if they were mere peanut sheels, setting lzwo new marks

against the Manhattan mermen.
Steve Ganong did the honors for
the Panthers this time as he esta-
blished new Pitt records in both
the 220 and 440 yard free style
events. ' _’ .
Displaying his graceful,
smooth flowing style, Ganong

swam the 220 in 2213.2, and
ﬁnished the 440 in 4152.6, bet-

 tering the old. mark by almost

three seconds. The previous re-
cords were set by Jim Zurcher
in 1956.

Although the New York team
was behind from the ﬁrst event
of the day, they managed to stay
close until the end of the meet,

Commenting on the NY}J squad,

VPitt swimming coach Ben Grady

had this to say, “We knew they
had a good all around team that
would keep battling all the way.

_»Because of that I told our boys

before the meet to try to win it

before the ﬁnal event.” ’
The Panthers. obliged the men-

tor as they wrapped up the” pack-

’ age in the breast stroke, and add-

ed the ribbon as they captured
a first placein the 400 yard free
style relay.

F illing Lauchle’s Void

Sherm Moyer,
Army Veteran,

In 130 11). Spot

The graduation, last year, of
Pitt's great 130 pound wrestler
Larry Lauchle was expected to

.-leave a hugh voidin the 1962 mat
lineup. Hopes were buoyed, how-

ever, when it was learned that
Sherm Moyer, a top notch 130
pounder, had returned to school
after a hitch in the Army.

It was expected that Moyer’s re-
turn would give the matmen an-
other strong performer in the 130

pound bracket. As a sophomore he

had been good enough to ﬁnish
fourth in the Eastern champion-
ships. '

But the lay-off has not added‘

to Moyer’s ability, or so it seems.
Thus far he has compiled a lack-
lustre 1-2-1 record. 
Coach Rex Peery has not been
dismayed by Moyer’s showing.
“Sherm’s two losses have been
to real good boys, Wilcox (Gary
of Michigan) took a third in the
Wilkes tournament and Welker
(Floyd of Army) is a.Pennsyl-

Vania state champion.” Peery
commented.
The coach expects improve--

ment from Moyer. “Sherm was
slow in getting into shape due to
the long layoff. His reflexes were
a little slow but they’re coming
along. He’s done all right so far
and ' expect himlto do better. I
think he can place at Easterns.”

, Temple Succumbs to Pitt Rally

By SANDY RESNICK

The West Virginia gymnasts
come to the Field House this
Tuesday night with hopes of re-
turning to their stills in the hills
with a victory. This meet will be
a “rubber match” between Pitt
and the Mounties because both
teams have won four times against
each other. -

Mountie Coach William Bonsall,
a former teammate at Penn State

with Pitt’s Coach Warren Neiger, '

will rely heavily on his Sopho-
more whiz Ed Ehler. “Ehler must
be an iron man,” says Neiger. “He
could be used in any of the six
events.”

Earl McConnell and Ed Za-
mecnik, Pitt’s best all—around
men will test the tenacity of the
iron man on the floor exercise
and horizontal bar events re-
spectively. ‘

A Pitt rally in the last event
of Saturday’s meet gave the Pan-
thers a 52-44 victory over Temple
at the Field House. Going into the
horizontal bar event the Panthers
trailed 41-39. A clean sweep on
this event by Ed Zamecnik,wEd
Stim, and Bob Pingatore account-
edfor the Pitt win. w

Earl McConnell scored a .27 to
take his ﬁfth consecutive ﬁrst
place in floor exercise. His near-
estvopponent was Temple’s Dave
Perilstein who received a 256. Mc-

__ Dary1’Ruby is a 6-1 ‘freshman
who is quite handsome, and was
considered quite a handsome grab
when he’ was plucked off» in the
annual‘ lottery ‘in which colleges
draft their future players. Ruby
was quite proﬁcient at scoring
baskets. . J

He was in high school anyhow,
but he has been a .minor disap-
pointmenton the Cub ﬁve so far
this year. What’s the matter?

“I-Ie’s pressing too hard,” frosh
coaching aide Billy Mauro claims.
“I ‘saw him in high school making
shots that he’s blowing right now.
He gets all tied up in a game.
He’s a good boy, and. he knows
what his bad points are.”

Has Been A Letdown

Mauro was pressed to admit,
however, that “he has been a let-
down so far from what we ex-
pected. He needs more conﬁdence.

Intra-mural basketball play has
just ﬁnished its seébnd week of
activity with the Buckeyes in the
lead in team standings. The Buck-
eyes have scored over 100 points
per game this season, the latest
being a 105-67 victory over the
Crusaders. ‘

Leading scorers are Mazurek of
the Holland '9 and gridder Jim

Kasic of the FE Club, tied with v

36 points.

Intra-mural director Leo Bemis
is well pleased with the progress.

of the hoopster leagues. “I’m glad
to see so many interested in bask-
etball, especially the commuting

DARYL RUBY
Frustrated Ito-rward

/

In fact, this whole ball club needs
more conﬁdence.”

In high school at Belle Ver-
non,'Ruby was the second lead-
ing scorer in the section, hitting
at a 24 point per game clip.
Willie Ross of Duquesne’s year-
ling team topped the area, but
“Willie had to bring the ball in,
bring it up court, grab the re-
bounds, and do all the scoring,”

    

says Ruby, “but he’s a real ﬁne
ballplayer.” _
With regards to his own play,
Ruby said, “I don’t know. I worry\
about my performandes, sure, but

Pm trying to come on. The coach-

es say that my timing is off, and
maybe I do get nervous. I’m going
to try hard, however, to get
straightened out real soon.”
Snubbed Dukes
Ruby is a close friend. of Ross,
and he was thinking about going
with him to neighborhood rival
Duquesne. He had narrowed his
choice‘ down to the Dukes, Pitt,
Arizona State and Utah.

“It was between Pitt and the
western schools, really,” Ruby
admitted. “I liked the fellas at
Duquesne, but I didn’t like their
facilities, like their rooming and
all. I always liked the setup at

’ Pitt.”

So Ruby shrunned the Dukes
and cam.e to Pitt where he’s play-
ing for a so-so outﬁt rather than
an undefeated ﬁve. “I don’t
mind,” says Ruby, “because the
boys on our varsity are awfully
good. I want to play with them.”

Last Wednesday the Frosh bask-
etball team played Youngstown,
losing the game 61 to 50, but they
played a much better game than

against Duquesne a week earlier.
They were within four points of
the lead until the closing minutes.
Coach Peterson had this to say.
“Our boys were tired. They played
a good defensive game but they
just ’couldn’t score. Youngstown
used a three-two zone defense
which we pulled apart, but they
just couldn’t sink those short-jump
shots.” '
When. asked whjeNBrian Fisher ‘
didn’t start he“"'replied, “Brian
was tired, he stayed home on
Tuesday to study and we ‘had

Cub oCageg,js Bow“  Youngstown;
Coach Peterson Explains Policy , ,«

  

been trying some new plays so
we decided to use him as sixth
man.” .

As for why a scholarship hold-

er, Bob Richardson hasn‘t been
playing, he said, “Richardson is a
good boy but he has some funda-
mentals to improve on. When he
does he’s going to be a good ball-
player.”

“~C o a c h Peterson commented,
“The fundamentals are learned in
practice which is the most im-
portant part of our season. The
actual playing in a game, whichis
only a small part of the season,

is a premium, the icing on the

cake. This gives the boys the in-
centive to practice and improve.”

    
    
    

If Ruby can get straightened
out he just might.
