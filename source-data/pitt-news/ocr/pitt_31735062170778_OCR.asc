Proposes Dorm Changes

by LARRY PANSINO

The creation of three intensive
study areas-—two in Tower C and
on in MCNR——and the admit-
tance of-male residents to Brack-
enridge_ Hall and MCNH are
among the major dormitory
changes planned for next year by

..\the Office of Residence Life. I

be located on floors 11-13 (for

gram. i i - . i V

Twoifloors of Brackenridge Hall
and half of MCNR will be filled by
meals next fall. Miriam E. Hirst
of the Office of Residence Life
said the co-education of MCNR
was due to the disproportion of

Pﬁemales with access to single
rooms. This year, women have a
seven-to-one advantage over men
in the occupany of the Universi-
ty’s single room accommodations.

Women will move into floors 11-
12 of Tower B next year tore‘-

first-year females.

The changes are in. part the re-
sult of a statisticalsurvey made
of the feelings of dorm students
on these and other propositions.
Questionnaires were extended to
3,400 residents in late Novem-

‘her, and 823 were completed and

returned. The study of the survey
said this 25 ‘per cent response is

.“statistically considered a rep-

presentative proportion of the to-
tal number.” '

Students in medicine. pharma-
cy. and. foreign languages re-
sponded most favorably to the
suggestions of intensive

, areas.

Drawings for next year’s room
assignments will be held on
March 12. Residents will be noti-
fied as to the drawing procedures
in a’ two-page notice from their

Resident Assistants early next"

week.

Hirst said that before the draw-
ings are conducted. there will be
visitation days for residents to in-
spect any room he, sh may wish
to occupy next year.

"were holding the drawings all
on one day to make the procedure
more fair. consistent. and equit-
able. And we'd like to stress the
fact that room retention is a priv-
ilege. not an absolute right."-
Hirst explained.

Campus Groups Reapply for Recognition

Organizations Re—evalucitecl 

by KAREN BURGIO

‘Committee of Student Organiza-
tions (CSOl will begin proceed-
ings on determining which stu-
dent groups on campus are active

*by revoking recognition for all

groups as of March 5;. 'lhe an-
nouncement concerning this pro-
cedure came at 'l‘uesday‘s Stu-
dent Government meeting.

CSO will soon send letters to all
student organization. asking
them to reapply for recognition.
This is to assist CS0 in its job of
revoking the charter of defunct
organizations.

‘In other business, an allocation

recommendation to give emer-
gency funds to the Men’s Glee
Club and the Woman’s Choral was
defeated.

The defeat of the budget modi-
fication concerns the November
concert given by both groups at
Carnegie Music Hall. The tlo
groups requested allocations for
the. rental of the hall. but music
director Dr. Phil Cavanaugh ask-
ed a soloist to perform with the
groups. and promised the soloist
payment. without consulting allo-

cations for additional funds. Allo-

cations refused ‘to fund the solo-
ist because the groups had ‘not
gone through proper channels

. for fund requests.

Dr. Cavanaugh eventually re-
ceived funds to pay t'or the solo-
ist from the music departments

While few of us give little
though to the carpets upon which
we find ourselves treading during
our daily duties. there are many
carpets throughout the world that
fulfill functions other than those
of covering floors and keeping
worn feet in a state of comfort.
This fact is amply demonstrated
by a new and important exhibition
of "Imperial Carpets from Pek-
ing” which opened this past Wed-
nesday in the University Art Gal-
lery of the Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing.

All of the carpets in the show
were created in the 19th century
for use in the Imperial buildings
in and around Peking. with a large
number of the groups being speci-
fically designated for ceremonial
usage in the Forbidden City itself.
What makes this showing so im-
portant for Pittsburgh and for the
entire artistic world is the fact

‘that it is an auspicious occasion
which displays some of the rar-
est and least known objects dart
of Chinese civilization.

‘Despite the fact that there are’.

to all interested persons informa-
_tion concerning instructions and
opportunities in scuba diving.

-Last term a number of club
dives were undertaken as well as
several outings made by smaller
factions of the memoership. A
night dive was held in October.
Another dive was made in Cheat
Lakef W. Va., where visibility
ranges from 30 to 50 feet. Dives
attempted lated in 1972 failed as
the divers’ regulators froze.

One of the ‘main events antici-
pated for this winter is an ice
dive. There will be further excur-

sions to those quarries in Penn- ,

sylvania and Ohio which provide
greater depths than Pitt’s Trees
Hall Pool and with a bit of luck
and a degree of work (in order to
raise some money), perhaps a
trip to Florida. The latter trip is,

list.

By JOHN POULIN

are successful. Heister is working
on the possibility of establishing
an "Office of Commuter Af-
fairs. which would be similar
to the Office of Residence Life
now serving students living on
campus.

"The office." explained Heis-
/ter. "would be staffed by a full-
time person who would. be in
direct contact with the adminis-
tration." This‘ would provide
an immediate channel through

their views, aAnd someone who
could "swing his weight to get

things done.”

Heister sees such an office as
"complementary" to the Com-
muter Association (CA) in help-
ing the new commuter get ("ac-
climated to the university,"
as well as generally "making
things better for the commuter."

He noted that “62.5 percent

Heister is also a member of

an extensive remodeling of the

ed as far back as ancient Greek
and Roman, domination and‘ex-
isted almost continually through
the period of British control. “I
don’t think the Egyptians really
know who they are as a result
of the constant intermingling of
other cultures with their popu-
lation.“

Americans are equally guilty
of this form of racism. says Cot-
tam. "Teddy Roosevelt used the
term ‘lower races‘ to designate

         
    

iental Gentleman. People who
think like and are sympathetic
to Western cultures, General
Thieu, Chiang Kai Chek, Batista,
and Truhillio come under this
category. '

"Looking at this behavior (im-
perialism). it seems to appear
only where’ European (or Ameri-
can) powers are threatened by
‘lower’ countries . . . this is the
reason for the‘ United States‘

. benign attitude toward Africa.“

4i-1'-THE PITT NEWS--Friday, February 16, 1973
by RALPH DEAN
Sometimes in an organization as large and complex as a Um-
“ '1;‘versity a single action takes place which moves those involved to
"  take a hard look at many aspects of that‘ organizations workings.
-—  Such an action is Dr. Sharon Johnson’s current lawsuit against
 the University (as represented by four oriits officials)" regarding the
1  decision which denied her faculty tenure over a year ago. This writer
will not attempt to answer the questions raised. either explicitly
7 or implicitly by the suit. This is a job for the courts and for the ad-

 ministration, through some soul-searching. I will. however. try to
'  outline these questions to present some idea of what is at stake here.

 The most direct issue.raised is that of possible sex discrimina-
'-"Z tion in the University’s Medical School. Johson cites in her suit
 i "figures which show that only 2.2 percent of the tenured faculty mem-
 bers in that s_chool are women. In answer to this the Dean of the-
] School of Medicine, Donald Medearis, stated that while there pro-
l1:_f{bably is discrimination in the school, that it had no part in the John-
_~1‘son decision. The further figure, which states that only 8 -percent of
.*~‘-4 the total faculty (which includes Assistant Professors, from the ranks
of which tenured members are chosen) suggests that there is- not much
"of an effort being made to correct the situation, commensurate with
 qualityor otherwise. Regardless of Johnson’s qualifications, the ques-
 tions remain - How widespread is the discrimination? How can it
'/if Ibest begcorrected? Through quotas? How high should the quotas be?
.~':1, Are they in themselves discriminatory?
Only slightly less explicit than the discrimination issue is John-

 

 

,j>.violation of academic due process. Johnson made appeals to the Af-

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  

 mittee, The Dean of the Medicine School, and the Office of the
 "Chancellor, without result. This would seem to support her charge.
.» iTh‘e_.__charge_is weakened considerably. however. when one considers
"f-fthat Johnson refused a hearing by a committee drawn from. the
=;~f:~_members of the Senate Council on the questionable grounds that
 the group would not be “a uepresentative body of people selected
‘ii by their peers." Answers are needed to these questions-Is the admin-
';,__' Iistration too tightly bound to legitimately question its own day—to-

<o_f ombundsmen being tried by a few other institutions be workable
here at Pitt"?

One of the long-standing issues raised again by this action is the
%viability of the tenure system here at Pitt. Most people would agree
,'th’at,:witl_1_ the current “buyer’s market” in the academic world the
‘ “current method of rapid turnover in thetassistant professor’s ranks
"7 -, yields benefits in the quality of the new tenured faculty. But should

ctiteria sufficient? How much emphasis should be placed on teach-
ing and how much’ on research? This last question refers‘ directly
to the ultimate mission of the University, so we are getting into some
ﬁlpretty heady stuff indeed. ‘ . V
 .0 , One hopes that the Administration has the nerve and the con-
fidence to avoid the knee-jerk reaction of indignation, which would be
{even easier if Johnson is indeed the ‘failure they claim in the areas
of teaching and public service. It would be a shame if they missed

a unique chance for analysis and changehera at Pitt. The Univer-
f sity has even more at stake than the $1,500,000.

A ColumnAnd A Half

by JOHN METCALFE

Every newspaper, even one of doubtful char-
acter. is likely to be swamped on any given day
by all-sorts of press releases. Press releases seem
to be an involuntary secretion of all organiza-
tions. great or small. In fact. the more obscure
the organization. the -more likely it is to produce
an elaborate release on the smallest pretext.

The University itself is a prime offender: this
is one of the reasons we often miss items of real
interest. If the University were to announce that
that it was going to go out of business and auction
off all its holdings next Friday at two in the after-
noon. the announcement would be in an envelope
with the University return address, and would be
in a bundle of perhaps fifty announcements of
slightly less import, all in identical University
envelopes. This is an extreme example.

A concert hall downtown, which has sold out
every seat in the house every year before the
season starts, sends us releases about three times

a week. We never print them. It would be cruel '

to stir up interest in an event that nobody can
attend-anyway.

Book publishers send us their opinions of their
latest offerings. We never printthem. We only re-
view books we have read, or at least seen.

Great corporations inform us of their. latest

' products. in fields as arcane as "high temper-
ature ablative insulation“ materials. We admire

the photographs which inevitably accompany
such puffery, but we never print a word.

There are rare exceptions, when an announce-
ment is so bizarre it amusesus. but we try to re-
strain ourselves. ‘ p

Other schools inform us of every appointment in

their various academic departments. We spaije you
the trouble of skipping such news. The Depart-

. ment of Defense, and its subsidiaries, inform us of \

every event of even marginal significance in the
lives of their subjects who have any connection,
however marginal, with the University, or the city,
or, indeed, with this general part of the country. 1

It is sad to see so much effort wasted, though
we consider it our high duty to shield our readers
from the pap that is offered us in the disguise of
News. '

(These releases arealways well constructed.
Without exception they follow the old precepts
of journalistic tradition. If more is to follow. the
bottom of the page carries the notation "more,"
if it is the last page, the notation is "-30-". The

upper left corner of second and succeeding pages
may be decorated with a short title and the in-
scription “add one,“"add two." and so forth. as
appropriate. If nothing else, news releases pro-
vide employment for Journalism majors who dis-
cover only too late that they cannot write.)

I trust you are shocked. No doubt you imagin-
ed that we passed our hours up here in our palatial
offices snickering about all the sinister things we
know but are unwilling to pass on to the public.
Now you know better. If our mail is that bad.
you can imagine how horrible our lives in general
must be.

This is getting too grim. Life in a newspaper
office does not have to be quite that grim; some-
times it is not.'There are days when, among the
treacle oozed out by various organizations, we find
a real message from a real person.

Such a message is know technically as a Letter
to the Editor. Often it comes from someone we

have offended, either deliberately or accidentally.
Sometimes it is from someone who. disagrees with '

us on some principle or other. It may be only an
angry note from someone whose name has been
misspelled or whose official title has been misrep-
resented.‘ .

Such a letter is a joy to all of us in the office.

For one thing, it is the only clue we havesas
to whether anybody- is reading the paper. We
know that about fifteen thousand copies vanish
every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Perhaps
someone is recycling on the grand scale, reselling
the bundled papers before they ever get read. '

A letter, now, suggests that someone had read

the paper with enough attention to have actually
become offended. It is a highform of flattery.

Those of us who have been here more than a-'

week or two know better than to expect letters of
praise.’ If we do get any we are embarrassed. and
don't print them. This is the ‘only form of censor-
ship,‘ which is ever applied to letters. (If you
exclude libels against non-members of the staff-
who remain fair game—and disguised advertise-
ments and such, that is.)

This is a long and ornate -message inviting

anyone who wishes to do so to write to us, on '

any subject of general interest, and many sub-

jects of less than general interest. I would not .

have had to make the message nearly so long nor
so ornate" if we had had some Letters to the Edi-
tor to fill all this space. ‘

If only to restrain me, write!

Baiting The Colonel

Sirsz’ , .
After r‘eadir'1g' Mike Meyer's
letter concerning “opposition“

at Col. Herbert's talk at David
Lawrence Hall. I thought that I'd
throw my two cents in. The “op-
pressed" man asking the ques-
tions who. rambled away "those
five minutes had nothing to say
and was obviously trying to bait
the poor colonel. He added noth-
ing to the. proceedings.
merely held back other people
who had relevant questions. He
constantly interrupted the colon-

-el as Herbert tried to give him,

logical answers.

It seems to me that Mike

Sir:

Ralph Dean has decided that
we should have nothing short of
a full Congressional hearing on
the Legal Awareness Committee.
while burning Mr. Pasek at the
stake. (Editorial entitled "Legal
Awareness?". 2, 9) 73)

.Mr. Dean spent two minutes
with Mr. Pasek asking about the
"discriminatory practices" and
then came to the. wild.conclu—
sions. He obviously totally miss-
ed the point, because Mr. Pasek
was suggesting that Freshman

but _

\

should be given the chance to,‘

choose between an optional meal
plan and a mandatory 18 meal
plan.

Mr. Dean suggests that "most

- administrators don't have as ela-
borate an office as that of Legal

Awareness Committee." I‘d hate
to see the administrator’s offices

if, they use repainted couches. "

rebuilt chairs, and 50-year old
decrepit desks. I also wonder
when the last time a University
administrator spent a weekend
cleaning and repairing his own
office. -

Maybe we should take a look
at Legal Awareness‘ budget. Be-
ing on the Allocations Committee
has made me no financial wizard.
but it did make me realize the
honesty and integrity of Jeff
Pasek and the Legal Awareness
Committee. For less than $6,000.
they have helped over one hund-
red students individually (with
such things as bail. legal prob-
lems. and even: so far as getting
money back for a shirt ruined at
a local laundry outlet). be-
sides helping students with in-

come tax returns, standing up‘

for "Pitt Students" in traffic
court. and informing students
of their rights and responsi-
bilities. '

I suggest Mr. Dean join the
staff of the "Daily Planet." as
they need someone to replace

UARR Precision

To the Editor.‘ -

.The article that appeared on '

the front page of Monday-"s Pitt
News prompted me to write this
letter. The article concerned
the recent Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council meeting -at
which the editorial policy
of the Undergraduate Academic
Review was discussed. I wish to
make reference to the word used
~to describe evaluations which pro-
fessors feel are inappropriate.
That word is ‘inaccurate.’ Inac-
curate connotes an arithmetic
error. an error in the tabulation,
the addition, subtraction or divi-
sion of the data which the UAR
receives from a survey. The re-
sults had been checked and were
found to be accurate. If anyone.
professorSadministrator, student,

thinks that there is something _

wrong with a survey, let me sug-
gest that the word inappropriate
be used in place of the word
‘inaccurate’. Thank you.

Students now taking intro-
ductory sociology courses with
800 classmates and up will pro-
bably be the last to do so at Pitt.
Beginning next fall, there will
be five introductory courses of-
fered. and the largest enrollment
in any one of them will be less
than half of what it is now.

A revision of the introductory
program is only one of several
major changes which will take
place in the Sociology Depart-
ment under Dr. Rich Conviser,
Director of Undergraduate Stu-

logy.
dies in Sociology. Conviser spoke
also of changes in the require-

ments for a sociology major and _

a complete reorganization of the
undergraduate.curriculum.

structure.” Only three courses
were required for a major—¥
sociological methods, theories,
and statistics—and not only was
the introductory course not re-
quired, but" it did‘ not count to-
ward the major. Conviser ex-
plained that many students assim-
ilated the necessary 24 credits
for a major by taking all rela-
tively lower level courses-.

Under the new program, socio-

logy courses will be divided into

introductory, intermediate. and
advanced levels. At every level,

courses will be grouped into five
district areas: sociological ana-
lysis. social interaction, social
and cultural organization. com-

parative sociology, and applied

sociology.

Although the introductory
courses will be open to every-
one, one division, sociological
analysis, will be required for
a _major——and it will count toward
the new major requirement of 30
credits.

This new approach, Conviser
explained, will eliminate the
problem of having students with
widely different levels of know-
ledge in sociology in the same
class. He spoke of an introductory
course he taught which contain-
ed both_ freshman and seniors
in sociology. ’

As the sociology major advanc-
es in the new program he/she will
he required to takeat least three
courses at the intermediate level

 

and two at the advanced level.
The advanced level—“for seniors
and talented juniors only”— Con-
viser related, will consist of sem-
inars and smaller, “more stimu-
lating” groups." Majors will have
the opportunity to concentrate in
one of the five main areas. but

concentration will not be a re- p

quirement.

Conviser expressed the hope
that the new system would
single out those students serious-
ly interested in sociology at the
intermediate and advanced lev-
els, and will provide for a better
learning environment. He. added
that the new requirements will
not be retroactive for current so-
ciology majors.

Another effect of the new

- program will be the "regulariza-

tion” of course offerings in the
department. Conviser explains
that in the past, courses were
often scheduled in an irregular

it difficult for the sociology
major toplan his/her course of
study. The new curriculum ar-
rangement aims at offering every
course at least once every two
years, with some offered every
term and some every other term.

Conviser indicated that this 
standardized scheduling of cours-j '

es might demand some faculty

sacrifice, but that this program '

was designed to give “more pre-
cedence to student interest.” The
plan was drawn up from sug-
gestions by the Sociology De-

partment’s Undergraduate Corn-'1 
mittee, two of whose members. 

are students—-one undergraduate A "

and one graduate.

Overall, Conviser said, the new‘ ’ I

program has been designed to pro-
“an education which will

WASHINGTON (AP) — An in-
vestigative reporter accused‘ of
possessing stolen government do-

cuments told a federal grand jury -
Wednesday the people had a right -

to know what the government was
trying to conceal.

Les Whitten, investigative re-
porter for columnist Jack Ander-

son. was one of four witnesses

who testified before the grand
jury in afive hour session Wed-
nesday. Also testifying were An-
derson and Indian leaders Hank
Adams and Anita Collins. '

Whitten and Adams were ar- '

rested two weeks ago as theyal-
legedly carried documents taken
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs

during the occupation by militant
Indians last year. They claimed
they were taking the documents
back to the BIA where they would
turn them over to the FMI.

All three were charged with
possessing stolen documents with
intent to convert them to their
own use.

Whitten was asked whether he

felt a journalist should handle
stolen documents and whether he

I felt. the Constitution permitted

such action. ~

.“I told_them reporters had a
right to the ‘document and to the
information in them,” Whitten
sai,d.“‘I "was not converting the
documents to my own, use, but the
news belongs" not’-to the govern-
ment but to the people.

Cease Fire Violations

C/aim l3,00(,)l Casulties

By GEORGE ESPER
Associated Press Writer

....SAIGON (AP) — A top-level State Department official joined
Wednesday in efforts to stabilize the Vietnam cease-fire that in 18

days has been riddled byviolations.

At the intervention of Deputy Asst. Secretary of State William H.

Sullivan, the four-party Joint Military Commission agreed to do —

something about trying to stop the shooting in which Saigon has
reported more than 13,000 Vietnamese casualties.

The senior American military representative,to the commission
warned the Viet Cong meanwhile. that the United States will not

tolerate any future delays in the release of American war prisoners in.

South Vietnam.

The Viet Cong delayed release of

for more than 10 hours.’

27 American prisoners Monday

Representatives of the United States, North and South Vietnam
and the Viet Cong also discussedthe 20 additional American prisoners
to be released from North Vietnam in the next few days. But it
is understood that no firm release time has been set.

U.S. officials made Sullivans intervention with the Joint Mili-
tary Commission known shortly before the United States‘ and North
Vietnam issued a joint communique on talks Sullivan and Henry A.

Kissinger held in Hanoi for four days.

The communique said the participants "had frank. serious and
constructive exchanges of views on the implementation of the agree-
ment on ending the war and restoring peace in Vietnam."

While Kissinger flew into Hong Kong Tuesday on his way

to China, Sullivan slipped quietly into Saigon.

In a series of meetings Wednesday, Sullivan conferred with all
four parties to the Vietnam peace agreement.

It was understood in Saigon’ that President Nixon has instructed
both Kissinger and Sullivan to make efforts to get the Vietnamese to
reduce hostilities, which though declining have persisted through the

cease—fire.

Maj. Gen. Gilbert H. Woodward, the chief U.S. delegate to the
Joint Military Commission. handed an official protest note to the
senior Viet Cong representative saying the Viet Cong violated the
peace agreement signed in Paris Jan. 27 by delaying the release of
the 27 American prisoners at Loc Ninh, 75 miles northof Saigon. A

Woodward accused the Viet Cong representative at Loc Ninh of
trying to induce the U.S. representative at the site, Brig. Gen. Stan
McClellan, to “sign a receipt on which had been added a remark
falsely ascribing to the Republic of South Vietnam responsibility
for a delay in receipt of U.S. personnel."

The Viet Cong commander at Loc Ninh would not release the
American prisoners until the Communist side had its own_ POWs
back. The Communist POWs-scheduled for release at Loc Ninh
staged a sit-down at the prison camp at Bien Hoa until they could
meet with their representative on the'Joint Military Commission.
The result was a delay of more than 10 hours.

A Viet Cong spokesman claimed that a team of the Joint Mili-
tary Commission sent to Can Tho in the Mekong Delta toinspect a
camp where Communist prisoners are held was denied the oppor-

tunity to carry out its mission.

It was a physical, fast paced.
not to mention sloppy. game on
Wednesday night as the Pitt
cagers throttled the North Caro-
lina A&T Aggies by the lopsided
score of 79-60.

There was a great deal of bang-
ing and battering the basketball
around and as a result both teams
committed many turnovers. The
Panthers turned the ball‘ over

26 times while the Aggies lost the '

ball 18 times. _
"Basketball is a game of emo-

tion and action and there’s a ball

there too,” commented the Pitt

head.c_oach Buzz Ridl on the pace '

of the contest. “Sometimes it’s
bouncing a lot and tonight, it

_ did a lot of it.”

Despite theinnumerable turn-
overs that occurred Rid] hesitated
to call it a ‘sloppy’ contest. '

“I don’t like to call the game

"sloppy. The defenses for both of

the teams deserve credit for the
number of errors they caused,”
related, the Pitt mentor. "There
was a lot of quickness out there

-but the total of turnovers was a -

bit unusual.”

Rock,

LyookT/o'C-MU Sunday .1

By BART MACK A

Prepping for Sunday night’s
rematch with Carnegie-‘Mellon,
the Pitt Hockey Club rolled over
Slippery Rock College, 12-0,
at the_Belmont Arena in Kittan—
ing last Wednesday night. .-

It was an extremely easy night
for Pitt and one factor was the
lack of skaters on the Slippery
Rock squad. The Rockers arriv-
ed ‘at the arena only a dozen
strong, meaning ,that they could
not skate three strong lines. The
Rockets could only contain Pitt
for the first period and even then
the icers scored three goals while

‘Slippery Rock did not manage

a shot on Pitt goalie Bart Mack.

Kerry Browne scored the first
of his three goals with 4:25 gone
in the first period but it wasn’t

until the fading seconds that Pitt"

finally leveled the Slippery Rock
defense. Rich Baginski tallied a
pair of goals within a. 28 second
span, his second goal coming
with only a moment left before
the horn. '

From the_ second period on, the
contest turned into nothing more
than another practice session
for Sunday's West Penn Hockey

‘Tournament. Pitt will face Car-

negie-Mellon at 7:00 p.m. in the
long awaited rematch between
the two schools. C-MU, dealt
the skaters their first loss to a
league opponent in one and a

/ half years.

If Pitt can enjoy as much
success against C-MU as they-did
against the. Rockets in the second
period alone, then their revenge
will" come quite easily. Kerry
Brownepicked up the final two
goals of his trick in the final four
minutes of theistanza while his
brother Denny scored early in the
period. Joe Testa and Tom Lang
also found the back of the nets
during the second period.

Lang banged in his secondgoal
past Slippery Rock netminder

Wayne Stephenson not long into -

the third period. Dave Bahnson
Greg Mintz and Glenn Hyde
completed the list of Pittescorers.

  Knight Cops 1.00015

’Would you believe it? Pitt’s
Mister Basketball Everything;
Bill Knight, surpassed another

milestone Wednesdayinight-.against

the North Caro-
lina A & T Ag-
gies. Knight cop-
ped and surpass-
Oed the 1,000
point plateau in
his varsity car-
eer.

T h e historic
moment came ear- -
ly in the contest as Knight con-
verted on a technical foul. which
had been called against the Ag-
gies Ronald Johnson.

With the announcement, Knight
received a warming ovation.

  

With his 22 points in the game.
‘Mooney’ now totals 1,019 points.
This ' leaves him a mere 32
points sits Julius Pegues, who
played for Pitt from 1954-57.

Furthermore, with 97
more points in his four remaining
games, Knight could surpass both
Brian" Generolovich and Calvin
Sheffield and capture the fifth
place on the all-time list.

So far this year, the Braddock
High School graduate has tallied
514 points._ This total exceeds
last year’s total, where he scor-
ed 504 points. With the four re-
maining games, Knight could
reach yet another milestone-
scoring 600 points in one“ year.
which hasn’t been done since Don
Hennon’s days. . - '

IIlllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllillIlllllllllllllllllllllIllIIllllllllIllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllllI

The Rockets put seven shots on
Mack in the second period but
all of them were from the blue

line or\ beyond. Mackshared the,

shutout with goalie Mark Lieber-
man, who was placed in the nets
for the third period in order to
get some practice in for the up-
coming C-MU contest.

Unfortunately Lieberman’s ice
time was quite uneventful as
Slippery‘ Rock put only a pair of
pucks on the net. In all, Pitt
outshot the Rockets, 46-9.

Pitt had a thorough workout“

last night at the Alpine Arena
for the Tourney and the skaters
are ready for Carnegie-Mellon.
Coach Guy Carole, refering to.

‘the icers m\ental lapses in their

“loss to the Tartans. claimed" that
':’We’ll be thinking of the game
thistime.” '

Pitt will face off against Car-
negie-Mellon in the first game
of the night , while Duquesne
will battle Indiana at 9:00 p.m.
Both the Dukes and Pitt will

. have one thing in common go-

ing into the tournament and
that is the fact that they will be
' looking for revenge.

Duquesne has never beaten In-

diana and lost a pair of games by
narrow margins to the Indians.
Doug Arnold, Indiana’s leading
goal scorer, suffered a broken
leg in practice two weeks ago
and, of course, will not be ac-
tion at'the Civic Arena ‘on Sun-

day. The Dukes are also out to ~

prove that they should be mak-
ing one of the four playoff spots.

Currently, Duquesne is running
behind both Pitt and C-MU in
the race for the two playoff berths
in the City Division and areal-
mo'st mathamatically eliminated
from second place.

Tickets for theggame are
available at the Student Un-
ion ticket office and the gate
at the Arena. Price of the
tickets will be $1.50 if pur-
chased in advance or $2.00 at

For the first nine minutes of
the contest the Panthers struggled
to keep in step with the Aggies.

At 11:15 the Aggies held the
lead for the last time, passing the
Cats by one point, 15-14, on a 20
foot shot by James Outlaw.

The Panthers secured their lead
at this point by collecting eight
straight points. Junior forward
Mickey Martin, who was second
highest scorer for the Pitt hoop-
sters with 21 points, sank seven
of these points. ' '

Martin started the lead-captur‘-
ing drive with a reverse layup
and followed with another layup
after grabbing a long pass from
Tom Richards -which ended as ‘a‘
three point play. I

‘ Bill “Mooney” Knight, who bet-

ing by only one point,_ pulled
in the one point during this seige

‘ that Martin didn’t get his hands

on. Knight collected the point
from the charity line after a tech-
nical was called on A&T’s Ronald
Johnson for elbowing.

' This shot was Knight’s 1000th
career point — he is in the eighth
spot in all-time leading scorers
at Pitt right behind Julius Pegues

 iThe 'Birdi Keeps Skying

in Philadelphia. He
received about a dozen athletic
scholarship offers from _schools
such as Temple and Penn. But
Kelly wanted to’ leave the City
of Brotherly Love for a few years.
so he accepted an academic
scholarship to Pitt instead.

Kelly is majoring in political
science at Pitt, and plans to be-
_come a lawyer an(Lreturn to Phil-
adelphia to open practice. {Right
now, though, his mind is on has-
ketball as well as school, and he
hopes to be on the varsity next
season.

“Willie, you have so much

God-given talent,"’ screams
freshman coach Tim Grgu-
.rich, “Use it!” The, 6’6” for-

ward’s talents include incredi-'

ble jumping ability, and asense
of being at home around the
basket.

His leaping ability has earn-

’ed him the nickname "Bird".

and his high school friends call
him "Beaumont". Many of his
high school friends attend Pitt.
and this has resulted in "Wil-
lie's Philly Fan Club." which
is in evidence at all yjayvee
home games.

Kelly has discovered an enor-
mous difference between Phil-
adelphia’s rugged high. school
basketball and college basketball
at Pitt. “Philadelphia ball is
very rugged, and you don‘t have
time to set up." he explained.
"You just run down and take
whatyou can get. It‘s more of
an individual type of play."

Kelly "is quite pleased with
the treatment ‘he has received
here at Pitt. “I think coac_h
Grgurich is one of the finest
coaches there is,” he declared.
“Our team gets together just like
a family, there ,aren’t any has-
sles. All of them are fine ball
players, and 'I’m just glad to be
on the same team with them.” “

Despite seeing limited ac-
tion earlier in the season due to
Keith Starrjand Tommy Rich-
ards playing on the junior var-
sity. Kelly is averaging about 15
points per game, and had his
finestishowing in Pitt’s 112-73
romp over Clarion State. when
he lead all scorers with a 28
point performance.

Kelly feels that he can play
better than he has been, playing
and will return to Philadelphia
this summer to work on his
"God-given ability". When he
returns in September, he may
loom_as one of the finest walk-
ons in college basketball history.
He will surely be a strong ad-
dition to the 1973-74 edition of
Pitt basketball.

JOHN TEMPLIN

Undefeated in Breaststroke

Pitt Swimmers
Seek   Fifth Win

Against Syracuse

By YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt tankers travel to Syracuse to face the Orangemen in
what should be a very exciting meet tomorrow.

The Syracuse team is very strong in the free-style department.

Pitt's main weakness. They feature swimmers like John Lawson. who
placed in the Easterns last year and swims the 50 and 100-yard free-

style for the Orangemen.

I The main troubles for the Cats should_come in the 1000 and 500- ‘

yard distance free-style events.

Syracuse has.a tough individual medley man who should give
Mark Winters a,.. lot of trouble. Winters has emerged as Pitt’s IM
man since his sickness when he was not able to swim the distance

- BVBIIIS.

The medley relay for the Cats is very strong and the Orange-
men might concede this event in order to save their best swim-

mers for other races.

The Cats are in good shape in the 200-yard breaststroke and but-
terfly with John Templin,Pitt's only undefeated swimmer, swim-
ming the breaststroke and Dave Nataliiwill be swimming the but-
terfly, the event in which he set a team record against Grove City

on Tuesday.

Mark Wallace will be swimming the 200-yard backstroke and
with. Ed Cahill right behind him they should be able to cop both

places in that event.

Dave'Simeone, who surprised everyone by winning the 550-yard
freestyle in the, Grove City meet, will be up against some tough com-
petition in the 200-yard free-style from Jerry Holohan.

In order towin this ‘meet, the Panther divers are going to‘

have to come through. Jack Garrow, who won both diving events
against Grove City, and Jeff Miller will have to be in top form to
take care of Mike Toth of Syracuse. Hecter Bass may also be div-
ing for the team tomorrow as he has finally achieved his eligibliity.

"We’re right where we want to be at this point. in the season."

says Dick Bradshaw, the tanker mentor. “They have matured greatly
this year and could finish up the season very well.” ' _

My mind wanders back to 1967

and the hiring of Coach Dave,-

the best freshman team in the
nation, Adams led his yearlings
to a smashing triumph in the
Michigan Frosh Tourney. Back
in my home town "of Bethlehem.
the Lehigh Engineers were-quak-

, ing in their shoes. Yet five years

have passed, and a fifth place
Eastern finish in 1972, coupled
with a tenth place in the 1970
Nationals are the only real
achievements. Do Navy and
Penn State have something Pitt
is lacking?

As a_Pitt undergraduate. it was
quite frustrating to see team af-
ter team. year after year. go
down to defeat. It's even worse’
now. My fellow law school class-
mates only know of one Pitt and
that‘s “arm-Pitt! ”

Instead of wasting all that
money on inadequate intercolle-
giate teams, why not greatly ex-
pand _intramural sports activity
and eliminate all athletic schol-
arships? Start some water polo.
Squash‘, rugby. and
teams. For one thing’. no sport

Lehigh, Navy, and Penn State,

t ’ s suimner.

With the Army ROTC Two -Year Program.
a , Army ROTC usually takes four years of college. But
YOU can do it in two.      W e R t
’ If, for example, you couldn’t take Army ROTC

during your first two years ofcollege.   T

.   Or if you just didn’t want to take Army ROTC before.
But now you recognize the benefits. a  

six-week Basic Camp the summer following youresophomore year.
a Camp—a little classroom workgesome challenging
physical training—replaces the Basic Course you would have
taken during your first two years of college. You’re well-paid for
this six-week catch—up. ‘ » n
Then, ‘after camp, you complete your Advanced 1
Course during your junior and senior years. P
A Maybe you’ll decide that theichance to get real
management experience earlier than most people will be worth
a lot‘ later on. R e e   T ~
I Maybe you can use the $100 per month subsistence
allowance you will get for up to 10 months of each school year.

Maybe qualifying for two careers simultaneously—— _ 
to military or civilia/n—is insurance against job uncertainties. 
Or, maybe the opportunity for an Army ROTC scholar— 
ship is exciting. P    .
