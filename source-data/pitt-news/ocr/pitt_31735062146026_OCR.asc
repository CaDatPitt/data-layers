A new ‘system for the distribution
of the mail of students whose ad-
dresses are unknown. has been in-
stalled in the University. Formerly
letters addressedto the student giv-

dress have -cluttered-. the post office,

-and notice of their-. arrival ‘posted on
..the various bulletin boards. The re-

_sponse of the students concerned
has been very _poor, only a "few claim-
ing their mail}? T-his necessitated the

to the dead, letter office and caused
much inconvenience to the students
who later -claimed the mail.-

The new system calls for the send-
ing of the letters to the College-
Education office, where-, if possible,
the addresses are ascertained. The.
remaining letters will then be re-
turned to the University post office
and placed in a. ﬁle which _is ar-
_ranged alphabetically. This ﬁle will
be cl-eaned out periodically and the
remaning mail sent to the dead letter
office. 

Any, student expecting a letter ad-
dressed to "the University can leave
his address at the post office and
upon -its receipt it will be given.-to
him.

_God and Evolution.

Accepting then the truth of the im-
mensitnyl‘-and omnipresence of the Di-
vine Being, Law-giver, Creator _aJl,<‘~
Preserver, the question arises as to
the manner in which that portion of
His creation“ with which we are fa-
miliar.‘ including ourselves, _ca.n’1e‘_in-
to‘ “being. In . reference to this sush-
ject there has -been ._an immense
amount of crude thinking in past
time- The conception of creative .ac-
tion has often been deﬁned in terms
of rudecraftsmen. Iremember hav-
ing seen somewhere in northern Italy
an old painting, representing God as
a, very aged man, with .a long, now-
ing bearcl, ‘seated at a __‘model_lerfs
‘bench, fashioning Adam and Eve out
of two lumps of clay, as a, sculptor
might fashion two ﬁgurines. I "recall
a sermon preached by a colored
clergyman, who had not risen higher
in his conception of creative” action
than had the old Italian painter, who
said: “De Lawd. took a lump ob clay
an’ he made it into a/man, and don
he set it up aginapfence to—dry,‘and
den he breeved into it do breff ob
life and dat waz de fu-st nian, Adam.-”
One of his- congregation arose and
demanded ‘to know whether he -might
ask a question. ."‘Sho,,-brudder, ya’
can ask. all de questions yo’. wants.”
The. intcrrogator then said: “Mista
-Minista, I wants to know whovmade
Idat ear fence.” The parson sternly
looked down upon him from the pul-
pit and said: “You fool nigga-, secla
questions would ‘de-troy any system
ob theology.” A -
It is a regrettable fact that even
in- this‘ age of supp'osed enlighten-
ment’ there are not a fexvwho have
failed to rise higher in their .con-'
ception than the old painter and the
old Negro minister; I very ‘well re;
call in the days of my youth having
been severely taken to task by a. ven-
erable clergyman to whom I ven-
tured to suggest that the Hebrew
word for “day” in the ﬁrst.Chapter
of‘ Genesis may signify also an in-
deﬁnite tiventzygfour hours of terres-
trial time. ," His conception of the
creative act was that of a process
measured in terms of g_a. Waterbury
clock. When I ventured to remon-
strate, he as much as intimated”tc
me- that I was on the road to de-
struction and recommended to me
repentance and prayer" as. the prop-
er cure for the frame of mind in
which I found myself. His concep-
tion of the creative act was that of
some sort of cyclonic catastrophe,’or
at. least into that it resolved itself.
The universe had sprung into being
in six days, one hundred and forty-
four hours, measured by his stop-
watch, and man in the crash of the
“grands ﬁnalef’. had appeared, upon
the scene, popping up like a jack-in-,
the-box. This ‘dear old ‘gentleman
had really never, given any real
thought to the matter, nor in fact to
any other important gmravtter. I was
fresh from reading Hugh Miller's
“Testimony.of‘ the Rocks” and Toy-
1er.Lewis’ _-“lSlix Days of Crea_ti_on.” I
had been diggiigg in the limestone
strata about, half a mile from the
school. I had» on my tableisome co-
Iprollites, revealing that big ﬁshes
had. eaten and‘ digested little ﬁshes,
and asked my clerical persecutor to
explain to me how, under his theory-
such’ things had come to be in the
rocky" sediments, suggesting that al-
gestion must have been rather«rapI’.d,'
ifall the sedimentary. rocks had been
.1aid~down with. a bang’ about six
thousand years a'go,‘.du1-ing ‘the lapse
of -approximately one ~ hundred} hours.

. His answer was: ‘ “Almighty God no

‘doubt created ‘those things just to
.confound unbelié-velrs,' such-’ as you."
His conception, of »creation-,‘ as well
as of “Almighty! G'od,"’I then instant-
ly and inwardly repudiated. More
fortunate, perhaps, than? many an-
other young man under like "provoca-
tion, I found comfort .froIn_my dear
father, himself a clergyman and a
man of science, who joined_me_ in_ 

l_ laugh at the notions of 1113’. well-

meaning- but ignorant ~ecclesiastir-al
"friend and” ‘‘professor.’? _ I

At noon Thursday, the Freshmen
held an. authorizel meeting in Memo-
rial hall to discuss‘ class organization.
During the. meeting, armed resistance
to Sophomore regulations was sug-
gested by the leader of. the Freshman
radical.wing. No official action_.was
taken on this suggestion, and the
Sophomore spies. merely mentioned it
to the wrecking crew. » - V ‘V O
‘ A‘_tribunal had been called for 4:30
o'clock the same day, and all but two
of the summoned Freshmen Omade
their appearance. However, ..they

in the hall until the last Freshman

_ had been taken in. They then made a

rush "for the ‘door andthree of them
were ‘ pushed into”the-room. VTwo
Sophomores immediately jumped on
them, but were pulled oﬁ -by _some of‘
the‘ other. men. Shouts of, “‘We don’t
want to ﬁght, we don’t‘ want to light,”
came from the Freshmen and" they
beat a hasty retreat. ' O I

The incident was a, decided Fresh-
man ﬁzzle and was "considered in-
signiﬁcant by the Sophomores.. Fri-
day morning, however,'one of the pa-
pers presented a magniﬁed and dis-.
tortioned account of the incident. -Ac-

whipped thirty Sophomores at the tri-
