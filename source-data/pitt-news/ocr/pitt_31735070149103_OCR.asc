Pitt starts
heightening
security

By Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Starting today, people can ex-
pect long wait times when en-
tering University buildings —
without their backpacks.

Pitt officials posted a state-
ment on Sunday explaining
heightened security measures
around campus;

Once police clear and secure
the buildings, Pitt will limit ac-

cess tothem. The statement, I

issued by Provost and Senior
Vice Chancellor Patricia Beeson
and Executive Vice Chancellor
Jerome Cochran,’says that over
the next few days these mea-
sures will apply to all build-
;ingS' , E ' l
g The statement did not spec-
ify which buildings the height-
ened security measures will ap_-
ply to on Monday.

Upon entering a secured
building, everyone will need

to present a Pitt ID. Only one

entrance in each building will
be open, andpeople should ar-
rive to their buildings earlier
than usual to accommodate for
the wait time.

The statement also says that
book bags, backpacks and pack-
ages will not be allowed in.

In addition, ‘non-Pitt resi-

dents will no longer be allowed
into residence» halls.
_ “We will continue to evacu-
ate and sweep buildings“ when
threats are received, but these
additional security measures
will reduce‘ the amount of time
needed to clear and reopen
the buildings,” the statement
said.‘

Drag kings, queens strut down catwalk to charity  

The Daily Student

By_]osh Won
Staff Writer

Virginia Snapplestein wore a tight
dress revealing a pink thong when
his artiﬁcial breast exploded on
stage at the Rainbow Alliance’s 11th
annual Pitt Drag Show.

_ “I hit the ﬂoor and splat,’.’ said
Snapplestein, a former Pitt em-
ployee at the University’s Mailing
Services. “And apparently, I ﬂashed
the dean of students.” A

Though there was a scarcity of
fabric covering’ his nether regions,
there was an abundance of students

in attendance, cheering as they

threw singles onstage and tucked
bills into the bras and garter belts
of performers in the WPU Assembly
room Friday night.

On a catwalk jutting from the
stage ihto the audience, drag kings

, and queens cartwheeled, baton

twirled and writhed to music for
two hours to raise money for char-
ity.

With nearly 450 people present
at the free event, the night raised
approximately $780 from audience
donations for the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force.

“We’ve been working with the
organization for a really long time,”
said Tricia Dougherty, president

EST. 1910

of Rainbow Alliance. “It’s a great
organization.”

She said that in addition to sup-
plying free and conﬁdential tests
for AIDS, the Pittsburgh AIDS

Task Force supplies the Rainbow ‘

Alliance with free condoms to dis-
tribute to students and offers safer
sex workshops for the beneﬁt of
Pittsburgh.

In thanks to the organization,
many drag kings and queens strut-
ted their stuff. Lai Kitruif, a mem-

._ ber of Rainbow Alliance, danced

Students walk miles for water in A

By Michael Ringling
Staﬂ" Writer

For many people in the world, get-
ting a glass of water is not as easy
as walking to the sink.

On Saturday afternoon, about
200 people accustomed to just
turning on the tap experienced a
long trek for water at the ﬁfth an-
nual Amizade Water Walk.

‘Amizade Global Service-Learn-
ing, a nonproﬁt organization that

raises money for clean water ‘

technologies in underdeveloped
countries, held the Water Walk on
the Cathedral of Learning lawn.
Participants walked the three-mile
route —— most carrying an orange
bucket ﬁlled with water — to the
pond in Schenley Park and Phipps

Conservatory, where they watered
the plants.

Brandon Blache—Cohen, the
executive director for Amizade
Global SerVice—Learning, estimat-
ed that Amizade raised between
$1,000 and $2,000 at Pitt’s Wa-

- ter Walk through registration fees.

The money from the event will go
toward a project in Santarem, Bra-
zil, that focuses on cleaning river
water.

Sara Noel, Amizade’s outreach
director, said that participants of
the event gained more than just
awareness of water inaccessibil-
ity.

“They realized how hard it is
to carry the water,” Noel said. “It
makes it a more personal connec-
tion when you feel‘ the bucket in
your hand.”

Pi_tt stays open
despite bomb threats,

The Pitt News Staff

‘ Pitt received 12 bomb threats this

weekend.

Despite the disruptions to cam-
pus and dorm life, Pitt oﬂicials say
the University will remain open.

On Saturday, Frick Fine Arts,
the Music Building, the Cathedral
of Learning, Litchﬁeld Towers and
Forbes, Sutherland and Holland
halls all received bomb threats.
The dormitories did not reopen
until late Saturday night.

On Sunday morning, Hillman
Library, Sennott Square and Ben-
edum Hall all received threats.

Around 4:40 p.m., Pitt re-
opened Hillman Library.

At the time of publication, the
Cathedral of Learning, Sennott
Square and Benedum Hall had not
yet been cleared.

This weekend’s threats bring
the total count for the semester
to 45.

Pitt ofﬁcials sent out multiple
statements over the weekend re-
garding the threats.

On Friday, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg issued a statement
praising Pitt’s handling of the
threats and letting the commu-
nity know that the University will
remain open. However, any stu-
dent that wishes to leave campus
can do so. '

“Any student who feels th-at
leaving campus before the end
of the academic term is the best
alternative can make that deci-
sion, and we will do our best to
facilitate the completion of his or
her remaining academic respon-
sibilities,” Nordenberg said in the
statement. '

Provost and Senior Vice Chan-
cellor Patricia Beeson sent a let-
ter to Pitt faculty asking them to
waive their attendance policies
for the rest of the semester even
though classes will still be held.

‘ She suggests that professors use

make-up classes and websites like
Courseweb and WebEx to help stu-
dents make up coursework.
Freshman Laura Yu already had
her bag packed with snacks and

4 Blache—Cohen said that the
Water Walk has grown nationally,
evolving from an event with 30
participants at the ﬁrst walk in‘
2007 to more than 1,000 people
participating in_ the current walks
that Amizade holds across the
country. -

Over the past ﬁve years, the
organization raised more than
$10,000 for clean water projects in
11 countries through. participants’
registration fees. The fees for Sat-
urday’s event ranged from $8 for
members of a group of 15 or more
people to $16 for non—student com-
munity members. ‘ ’

Blache—Cohen said that Am-
izade used this money to buil_d
ﬁve 300,000-liter tanks and 16
smaller water tanks that have given
more than 1,000" people access to

  

mizaile Water Wal

clean water in. places such as Tan-
zania. .

. Although the organization has
increased .the number of people

0 with clean water, Blache—Cohen

said that Amizade hasn’t com-
pleted its mission of providing
underdeveloped countries with
clean water just yet.

“There is a global water crisis,”
Blache—Cohen said. “We still have
a lot of work to do.”

Natalie Capozzolo, a third-year
student in Pitt’s School of Pharma-
cy and coordinator for the Inter-
national Pharmaceutical Students’
Federation, said that the event was

primarily student—ri1j:n-— a collabo-l A

ration between undergraduate and
graduate students.’ A

Capozzolo said she heard about
the Water Walk a few years ago, and

after seeing that West Virginia Uni-

she went to Amizade and proposed

medicine.

“Clean water is a huge public
health issue,” Capozzolo said, add-
ing that people “can’t make medi-
cine without clean water.’_’ i

Colleen Moroney, president of
Student-Leaders in International
Medicine, said slie hoped the event
spread awareness about the wa-
ter issues that many people face
around the world.

“Water _a resource we take

for grante_d,’.’ Moroney said. “As
the population of the world grows,

water access will be a major politi-
cal issue.”

threats.

“The safety and welfare of the University

Keep calm, avoid spreading false
about bomb threats P

TLll’l’lOTS

By Tracey Hickey
Columnist

  

The'past week’s deluge of bomb
threats has been — among other
things —— a royal pain in the ass.
These are the times that try
if not men’s souls, then certainly
their patience. With threats now
up to about seven buildings a day,
even the students who write them
off as practical jokes or grasps for .

attention now ﬁnd themselves
plagued with uncertainties about
the most mundane aspects of their
lives. Will I be able to meet with.my
TA before the test? Is the test even
likely tohappen tomorrow? How
badly are all these lost hours on
my work~study job going to screw
up my paycheck? Will I be able to
sleep in my own bed tonight?

In a surreal world where voice-
mailboxes are emptied daily so

notiﬁcations, my friend Sarah, who
works as a courier forlan oﬂice in
thecathedral, now carries all her
belongings with her on every de-
livery, because if she leaves them in
the oﬁice she might not be able to
retrieve them when she needs to.
I know students living in the quad
who have started sleeping in their
clothes. The emergency situation
has become the everyday reality

FROM PAGE 7

around which we’ve all begun to structure
our lives, necessarily planning ahead for the
totally unpredictable. ‘ ~
Aggravation is melting into anxiety as
1ate—night threats againstresidence halls
make last week’s consensus — that the
messages are coming from a handful of ir-p
responsible students looking to reschedule
their tests — exceedingly unlikely. No one,
least of all me, knows who’s doing this or
when the hell it’s going to stop. I write this
with the earnest hope that the perpetrator
is arrested tomorrow, rendering this col-

‘ umn irrelevant before it can go to press. But

sadly, it’s realistic to assume that not only
will this nothappen but that the threats will
continue, perhaps even escalate, and we will
continue to live under these conditions for
some time yet. i I ’
Fear and anxiety are understandable.
There are many reasons why a person would
threaten to bomb a school, and most of them’
-— seeking attention, for example-— accord
alltoo well with the reasonsthat motivate
people to commit violent crimes. a
However, where there’s an anxious 
lation, there will always be those willing to
take advantage of peoples’ fears.’ Take, for
example, whateverjerk started the seem-
ingly untraceable Internet rumor that Vir-
ginia Tech received 20 false bomb threats in
the weeks before the infamous April 2007
shooting; That story isn’t true — there were
bomb threats at Virginia Tech shortly before

‘ the shooting, but only a handful’: between
= two and ﬁve depending on what qualiﬁes as

an independent incident. There was also one
more that happened days after the shooting,
for which the dead gunman Seung—Hui Cho
could not have been responsible.

. This mayseem like a hairsplitting differ-
ence, but symbolically it isn’t. The rumor
implies that 20 is a magic number, causing
already-fearful students to speculate that
Pitt will be attacked soon after we hit that

mark (which we have). In fact, wesurpassed
Virginia Tech’s actual bomb threat count two
weeks ago, making it unlikely that we are
dealing with a methodical Cho wannabe.
An atmosphere of widespread fear breeds
panic—exacerbating rumors the way a warm,

wet climate breeds fungus. We all have a A

duty to each other to avoid propagating
them and to research and challenge them
wherever they appear. Your fellow students
are already scared and on edge; those with
anxiety problems or previous experiences
of trauma have takena serious hit to their
well-being in the past few weeks. You owe it
to them to do what you can to ensure that the
information circulating amongst you is that
of a true, veriﬁed and helpful nature.

Overall, I am very proud of how Pitt stu-
dents have handled these threats.

Tonight, I’ve seen my Facebook feed over-
run with off-campus residents pre-emptively
offering their couches to any on—campus
friends whose dorms might’ be evacuated.
I’ve seen my peers embracing the morbid

' humor of the situation, cracking hilarious

jokes about the Chamber of Secrets and Pitt
ENS resembling a clingy girlfriend, while
still remaining steadfast in their support
of the administration’s prioritizing safety
over convenience, even as we pass into the
double—digit threat count. V

And most of all, I’ve seen my fellow stu-
dents echoing this message: Keep going.
Keep your eyes‘ open, keep your wits about
you, but keep going to class, keep doing your
work, keep participating in and leading all
the awesome initiatives you’re known for.
We might, be pissed off and frustrated and

scared, but we won’t be pissed off and fru‘s- l

trated and scared outof doing what we came

here to do. i. .,
After all, as Sarah said when nonchalantly r

explaining that, yes, her backpack is heavy,
but she has two papers due this week, and
she can’t afford to have her laptop stranded
in a locked-down Cathedral: “We can’t not
live our lives.” 9

‘ Connecticut sweeps Panthers in homeseries

By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt baseball team continued
to struggle in important at—bats
this weekend as Connecticut swept
the Panthers at Cost-Field.

Pitt head coach Joe Jordano

A said the Panthers didn’t take ad— .

vantage of their offensive oppor-
tunities. .

“We needed to have some .big
at-bats, and We didn’t get them,”

Jordano said. “We’re going to need .

to be in a little better position,
especially against a team like
UConn, who pitches extremely
well. We have to takeptadvantage
of our of>portunities.i’?  ’ /'

Huailei Wang I Senior Staff Pl1otograpl1er
The Pitt baseball team has struggled to record timely hits this season.

Connecticut 8, Pitt 2

Connecticut got out to an early
lead on Pitt’s ace Matt Iannazzo
with two runs in the ﬁrst inning
on three hits. . '

The senior left—hander settled
in for two scoreless innings after
the ﬁrst, but the’ Huskies got back
on the board in the fourth and ﬁfth
innings, scoring a run in each.

Pitt plated its ﬁrst run of the

game in the sixth inning when »

Stephen Vranka singled to start
the inning. Anthony DeFabio con-
..tinued his hot season, doubling
to bring Vranka around to third.
Rick Devereaux then picked up
an RBI when he grounded out to

shortstop.‘
In the next inning, the Pan-

thers picked up another run af-
ter three straight singles and a
throwing error allowed the sec-
ond run to score.Jordano said he
would have liked to see his team
plate more runs in an inning that

started with three singles before 1

recording an out.

“If we push a couple of those
runs across, it’s a different ball-
game,” Jordano said. “It affects
everything we do. I’m a little bit
disappointed in how we executed

' today.”

Jordano pulled Iannazzo after
a Connecticut runner reached
base on an error. The senior ﬁn-
ished the day with seven innings

four earned runs. He also walked

The Pitt softball team picked
up- its first Big East win of the
season this weekend, and the
Panthers didn’t stop there.

, Pitt started conference play
0-6 after being swept by the Big
East’s two best teams in Louis-
ville and South Florida. But the
Panthers (20-17, 3-6 Big East)
responded with a sweep oftheir

Larkin struggled for accuracy in l

the first inning, and the Friars
took advantage of two walks to
jump out to an early 3-0 lead.
Larkin settled down, and
the Panthers chipped away at
the deficit with one run in the
second and fourth innings.
Cheesebrew’s single in the sixth
inning scored freshman Carissa
Throckmorton and senior Kelly
Hmiel, giving Pitt the lead.

Stevens finished off her per-

luoki_ng at Pittsburgh-Philailelphia L

rivalry in seven categories ~

By R] Sepich
Staﬁ" Writer

Normally, the sight of Philadelphia Phil-
lies shirts or Flyers jerseys in the streets
of Pittsburgh would attract attention from
the Steel City’s passionate sports fans.

But people from one area of Pittsburgh
have grown accustomed to it. 1

The displays of bright red and burnt
orange sports apparel are commonplace
on the University of Pittsbu_rgh’s campus,
where a large number of students fre-
quently show their allegiance to eastern
Pennsylvania.

With the Phillies recently in town to face
the Pittsburgh Pirates for Major League
Baseball’s opening weekend and the Fly-
ers and Pittsburgh Penguins set to duel
in a playofﬁhockey series that might see
more ﬁghts than goals, the never-ending
Pittsburgh-Philadelphia rivalry has been
a popular point of discussion among Pitt
students. '

This best of seven showdown compar-
ing each city’s attributes should settle this
debate once and for all:

Baseball

MCT Campus
The Pit’tsbLii'gli SlCL‘lL.‘I‘S have the edge over Pliiladclpliia on the l'0i‘)t|)nll lleld.

When it comes to the game often re-
ferred to as America’s pastime, both cities
have a lot to be proud of.

The Pirates’ history boasts ﬁve Major
League Baseball championships and the
most famous hit in baseball — Bill Maze-
roski’s walk—off home run to beat the New
York Yankees in Game Seven of the 1960
World Series.

Meanwhile, the Phillies have only won
two titles, but recent history is on their
side considering both of those champion-
ships were more recent than the Pirates’
last World Series victory in 1979.

And with the Pirates currently _mired
in a 19-year streak_ of losing seasons —
the longest in professional sports — it is
impossible to give them the nod.

Philadelphia takes the early lead.

Hockey

The biggest head—to—head rivalry be-
tween the two cities transpires on the ice.
The Flyers and Penguins — and their fan
bases — just don’t like each other.

Even though the Flyers lead the all-time
series against the Penguins and have ap-
peared in twice as many Stanley Cup Fi-
nals, the Penguins have actually raised

Pitt’s Ethan Mildren continued his V

stretch of solid pitching outings on Friday
with his third straight complete game. He
said he has approached every game this
season with the goal of going the whole
game and giving his team the best chance
to win. , '
“Asa pitcher, you always like to plan
pitching‘ the whole game,” Mildren said.
“The main thing I always try to do is keep
my pitch count down, throw strikes and give
my team the best opportunity to win.”
The sophomore entered Saturday with
16 consecutive scoreless innings andfkept

‘that streak going until the seventh inning,

when the streak was halted at 2,2.
“It was awell—played game today. Ethan

gave us another outstanding performance '

and put us in a position to win,” Jordano
said. “We played well again defensively but
did not get the timely hit; although, we did

hit some’ balls hard.”

The, Panthers jumped out in the lead

when Boo Vazquez singled and was brought ;

After Pitt took the lead, Mildren strug-

up three hits, leading to two runs for the
Huskies. v

the Huskies’ second run. The run was cred-

three Stanley Cup trophies compared to
the Flyers’ two.

Over the years, Philadelphia’s hockey
team has had success playing an aggressive
style, earning them the nickname of the
“Broad Street Bullies.” The Penguins, on
the other hand, have drafted and won with
some of the most skilled offensive players
in the history of the game. A

. Current Penguins Evgeni Malkin and
Sidney Crosby are the two best players in
the NHL, but the franchise might not be in

hockey legend Mario Lemieux not bought
the team. He also helped in the process
of building the brand new Consol Energy
Center downtown.

Pittsburgh takes this one because of
Lemieux, and Philadelphia should con-
sider itself lucky that Flyers forward Scott
Hartnell’s wacky haircut did not deduct a
point from its tally.

Football

Comparing the Pittsburgh Steelers and
the Philadelphia Eagles is not a case of ask-
ing, “What have you done for me lately?”
Instead, it is more like, “What have you
done for me ever?”

While the Steelers’ six Super Bowl titles

make them the most successful franchise
in National Football League history, the
Eagles are one of the 14 current NFL teams
to have never won America’s-biggest foot-
ball game. ‘ ’

Heck, even the Pitt football team’s 1976

national championship season means it has ’
brought a title to Pittsburgh more recently»

than the Eagles have to Philadelphia.

, In fact, some Steelers fans often joking-
ly state that the only noteworthy moment
in the history of the Eagles occurred during
the 1943 season when World War II forced
the two franchises to combine rosters and
form ateam knownas the “Steagles.”

There is no debating this one. Pitts— .

burgh easily picks up the point. ‘

Basketball
With the lack of a professional basket-

ball team in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia has _

a huge edge in this category. _

The Philadelphia 76ers own two NBA
championships, _which is two more titles
than Pittsburgh’s three Division I NCAA
basketball teams — Pitt, Duquesne and
Robert Morris — can claim. V

Philadelphia is also home to the Big 5,
which consists of five Division I basketball
schools — Penn, La Salle, Saint]oseph’s,
Temple and Villanova — that are in or near
the Philadelphia city limits. Villanova won
a national championship in 1985. V

Although the 76ers are just an average
franchise in today’s NBA, they win their
city the point for this category.

Food ., V

This argument, more than any other be-
tween Pittsburghers and Philadelphians,
is all about personal preference.

The Philly Cheesesteak is a classic hoa-
gie synonymous with Pennsylvania’s big-
gest city, while the variety, of sandwiches
and toppings available at Pittsburgh’s fa~
mous Primanti Bros. Restaurants makes
the Steel City’s sandwich one of a kind.

But the idea of putting coleslaw on a
sandwich can make some stomachs turn.
The broader appealof the cheesesteak
gives it the nod.

Music , _

Popular names like Christina Aguilera
and Boyz II Men hail from both cities, but
this essentially comes down to a rap battle
between Wiz Khalifa, a graduate of Pitts—
burgh’s Taylor Allderdice High School,
and Meek Mill, an upcoming rapper from
Philadelphia. ‘ s , ~

This one is close, but until Meek Mill
turns a song about two colors into a city
anthem and a No. 1 hit like Wiz Khalifa did
withi“Black and Yellow,” then the Pitts-
burgh native has the advantage.

Pittsburgh ties it up."

Intangibles

With sports, food and music unable
to settle this debate, it all comes down
to the intangibles that give each city its

’ personality and uniqueness. V
Some Philadelphia natives will claim

that Wawa, the popular food and gas sta-

- tion, gives them the edge because’ Sheetz

doesn’t have locations in downtown Pitts—
burgh like Wawa does in Philadelphia. And

.. sure, the Declaration of Independence was

signed in Philadelphia.
But how can you take a city that calls
itself the “City of Brotherly Love” seri-

, ously when its residents once booed a man
' dressed as Santa Claus at an Eagles game?

That isn’t brotherly or loving.’

Sorry Philadel'p’hia,.but in this argu-
ment, 'Pittsburgh‘_'actually backs up its
popular nicknanie: the “Cityof Champi-
ons.” V - "

_And just for the record, Sheetz is better I

than Wawa. Q .

Michigan
transfer
Zeigle
commits to  
Pitt

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team added a key
piece to its roster on Saturday when Central
Michigan transfer Trey. Zeigler decided to
become a Panther. A

“Just committed to the University of
Pittsburgh! #hai12pitt,” Zeigler tweeted on
Saturday. '

Zeigler’s father, Ernie Zeigler, was ﬁred
as the head coach of Central Michigan this
spring, prompting Trey to leave the univer-
sity as well. A four-star guard in the class of
2010,» Zeigler chose Pitt over several high-
level schools, including Duke and UCLA.

Because his father left Central Michi-
gan, Zeigler ﬁled a waiver with the NCAA
that would allow him to play the 2012-2013
season. Most transfers have to sit out a year
at their new school. If Zeigler can play next
season, he’ll be a junior and have two full
years of eligibility. If the NCAA doesn’t grant
his waiver, he’ll redshirt a year and still have
two years to play for Pitt.

Zeigler joins an incoming recruiting class
with ﬁve—star center Steven Adams, four-star
guardjames Robinson and three-star guard
Chrisjones. He ﬁlls a gap on Pitt’s roster left
when redshirt freshman point guard Isaiah
Epps decided to transfer closer to home for
farnily-related reasons.

> Without Zeigler, Pitt’s 2012 recruiting
class is ranked No. 13 in the country by
ESPN. A , ,

Zeigler, a 6-foot-5, 203—pound shooting
guard, averaged 15.8 points and 6.7 rebounds
for Central Michigan this season after put-
ting up 16.3 points per game as a freshman.
He ended his sophomore year 26th on Cen-
tral Michigan’s all—time scoring list, already
having passed the ‘1,000—point mark with
1,011 points.

He was a third—team All-Middle Atlantic
Conference selection as a sophomore and
ﬁnished second in the MAC Freshman of
the Year as'a rookie. *

In 2010, Zeigler chose Central Michigan
over major schools such as Arizona, Duke,
Michigan, Michigan State, UCLA and Okla-
homa. He was ranked as the No. 4 shoot-
ing guard in his class and the No. 28 player
overall. ﬂ
