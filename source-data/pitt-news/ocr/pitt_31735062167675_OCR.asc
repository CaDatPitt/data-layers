Sharfman Denounces

g War As Obsolete

by IRENE CALIENDO
Staff Writer

"Peace demands a world wide
system of law and peace. The war
system is the arch enemy of man:
it is obsolete. and it must be de-
stroyed." so says Peter Sharf-
man. associate professor of poli-
tical science at Cornell Universi-
ty. speaking at Carnegie-Mellon
University.

Sharfman is chairman of the
Policy Committee o_f the United
World Federalists (UWF) and was
acting as representative for that
organization. Sharfman‘s main
purpose was to recruit new mem-
bers for the organization. ‘

The Harvard graduate contin-
ued, saying, “Most people only
talk about their aims. Stating your
goals is no good—one-must have
an idea how to get it. The tough
thing about action is finding things
which can be done to get world
peace,”‘Sharfman went on, “and

_ the UWF has a moral obligation

to keep plugging.” '

Sharfman explained the prob-
lem of how most of society
achieves their goals. He said we
use -unrealistic dilemma (that
which we want) and realistic di-
lemma (that. which we can get.

but don‘t really want) and termed‘

this the "dilemma of the human
race." '

He also pointed out that there
exists‘ two types of conflict: “a
fake conflict, that is, a mutual
misunderstanding that can be re-
solved by talking, and a real con-
flict, which is one that looks more
complex the more you look at it.”

According to the political sci-
ence professor. most of our politi-
cal dilemmas are real conflicts.
They must beresolved or the last
resort is war.’ Mr. Sharfman and
the UWF state that war must be
replaced. They suggest ‘a world
government. "We (the people of
the US.) decided that a govern-
ment with flaws is better than per-
petual civil war. Wouldn't a world
government he better than inter-
national war." he queried.

Sharfman hastened to add, how-
ever, that a ‘world government

= (would not be perfect or solve ev-

‘eryone"s problems,,but he mere-
ly presents it as an improvement
of our present system.

Mentioning the U.S.'sv foreign
policy. he said. "Nobody knows
where American foreign policy is

H ojmecomi

going. Item after item is sacri-
ficed because of Vietnam. . . . If
we do pull out we'll have no for-
eign policy left." He said that be-
cause of this situation. “progress
toward world federation is enter-
ing into an unusually good time
for putting that goal across."
According to Sharfman we will
only accomplish this if we all ‘act
to change the direction of Ameri-

can foreign policy. “Other mem- ;

bers of UFW around the world are
working to get their foreign policy
changed.” He explained that he
does not mean disbanding Ameri-
can interests but “sooner or later
the UN will have to be given more

power.”

Sharfman mentioned. that UWF
USA have run lobbies in Washing-

ton. including lobbies for the fail-.

ure of the ABM system. and put-
ting pressure on the executive
branch and Congress to take the
talks which are going to take place
in Finland between the U.S. and
Russia concerning the Vietna-
mese war. seriously. He conced-
ed that the UFW should be "build-
ing a, swell of public opinion. But."
he said. “it is up to all of us to do
that." 0

(Editor's Note: See interview of
Chavez on Page 2.)

A crowd of about 300 people I

welcomed Cesar Chavez with a
standing ovation as he entered
the Student Union ballroom at
noon last Friday. The serene
grape boycott leader was ushered
to a special chair to accommodate
his injured back.

Before Mary Moses. Chavez's
nurse. began to speak an annouce-
ment was made concerning a bill
recently introducedby State Sen-
ator Gerald Kaufman of Pitts-
burgh. The bill urged the people
of Pennsylvania- to support the
grape boycott.

Miss Moses spoke briefly on
the use and affect of pesticides.
Cited in particular were DDT and
organo phosphates. She said the
former has been linked with can-
cer and leukemia. while the lat-
ter has been correlated with a
sudden. nerve gas type death.
Miss Moses said that almost 90.-
000 injuries and over 850 deaths
are caused yearly by pesticides
as well as the damage done to

Dr. Moore is‘director of the

After elaborating on the serious-
ness of the situation» Miss Moses
charged that the Federal Food and
Drug Administration is “white-
washing” the problem.

At this point Chavez took the
podium and introduced Pitts-
burgh's boycott organizer.—Al Ro-
jas. Mr. Chavez jokinglynoted

Project  

stration project began last Nov. _
18 with an entire pre-school '

‘class from the Letsche Elemen-
‘-tary scnoo1;" The childreirattended
one-half hour sessions each day.

“We asked the public schools to
designate a deep ghetto school,”
Dr. Moore said. “We wanted an
area and circumstances in which
children do not_ normally prosper
in school!’

The children were taught many
of the same subjects a'vailable in
pre-school classes such as reading
and writing. but also some others
which are not available; typing is
an example. A noon nursery class
of 18 three and four year olds be-

gan this September bringing the '

tion to the boycott, ranking it‘.-
ahead of sex education and com-. S
munism. He then began to speak, 

on the boycott and the 49 month

old farm worker strike. He com-V.
mented that striking unions are"
usually destroyed within 20 days,
through the use of Mexican strike-3 _
breakers and the surrounding po- 
litical. religious and economic, "P
system. Said Mr. Chavez. "Farm_
%workers_must not only take on op‘-.

position from employers but all‘

the power structures of thecomf

munity."

The United_ Farm Workers Or-7
leader;
stressed the non-violent tone of-'
the strike. He said that despite-«
the suppression of the people “the,
workers are not engulfed in‘
hatred.“ Chavez considered, this -
non-violent approach an offensive‘ ‘‘

weapon. “in focusing attention on

the party responsible and keeping in
direction in the movement,“ he .

continued.

In Pittsburgh, grape sales are
off, 20 per cent but the boycott __
spokesman feels it could be bet- [

ter. Chavez cited the fact that the"
U.S. Defense Dept. has increased

its grape purchases 800 per cent 
since the boycott began. When’ '-
Vquestioned as to the reasons for 
the sudden increase the govern-. '
ment said that it “was purchas-’ ' ‘F

ing grapes to remain neutral.”

When asked about the extent of - ‘

worker support Mr. Chavez stat-

ed. that there were few striking‘ 
farm workers but that all the
UFWOC was asking for was ‘a;_-
free election to determine wheth- 
er the workers-wished to organize .-
or not. Another question brought:
up the suggestion of President :-
Nixon to take the problem to the. '
National Labor Relations Board."-W-?I

Chavez replied that agricultural
workers were not covered under

the NLRB a'nd.Nixon was well-g

aware of the fact.

Before leaving Mr. Chavez ask"-1'
ed for the help of the people of * --

Pittsliurgh in stopping California

grape sales in Kroger stores, the"f'

to sell them. Another standing-J-if
ovation accompanied Cesar Cha-

Staff Writer

_  _ The great man, in many ways,
.. , is a paradox in human form. He is
_ at once sublimely simple and ‘in-
._ ‘j .tri_cately profound. Because he is
’ ‘capable of keen. insight, he is
_ _" tempted by the demon pride, but,
I as, one who is painfully aware of
his own inadequacies, he is gen-
‘ , -uinely humble. Although torment-
 by the reality of existing con-
-3‘ ditions, he exudes an authentic
 ‘aura of inner peace.

Cesar Chavez appreciates the
_, _ ‘ consternation of those who see in
 him both a gentle spokesman for
‘a group of poor people and a re-
lentless labor organizer, but he.
V suggests that the two images are
‘ V compatible. “I get mad,” he ex-
 plains, “but I use that heat and
keep it inside to do the work that
. H ,_ {must be done to bring about social
 } change.”
4 _ With characteristic humility,
. however, the head of the United
K __-_Farm Workers Organizing Com-
’ mittee flatly rejects the implica-
tion that he is different from the
people he represents. “My mo-
, _ tives are no greater than those
' ,~. . of most farm workers,” Chavez
’ ' insists, noting that he’s a "pro-
‘ duct of the same system.”
In a Pitt News interview. the
,_ driving force behind the nation-
’  wide grape boycott movement
candidly discussed his fundamen-
tal beliefs. Emphasizing that he
. himself is still striving to live up
' to his .ideals, the little Mexican-
American capsulized his philoso-
' phy of life. "As human beings." he
7 declared, “we have a very spe-

cial mission in this life, and that
is service to humanity. There is

  

 

no betterway to do this than by-

helping people with the problems
that they have and by devoting
time and energy towards that
end."

Selecting Jesus Christ, Mahat-
ma Gandhi, and Martin Luther
King, Jr. as the men he has tried
to emulate, Chavez, a devout Ro-
man Catholic, labeled the teach-
ings of Christ “the biggest influ-
ence on my life.” He also express-
ed admiration for Saint Francis
of Assisi, whom he considers a
great man, “because of his will-
ingness to expend himself for
other men and because of his de-
tachment from material posses-
sions.”

A dedicated disciple of non-
violence. Chavez traced his es-
pousal of non-viole_nce to the
teachings of his mother. “an illi-
terate but very wise person.“ He
recalled that she taught her chil-
dren “very simple. basic things
like ‘It takes two to have a fight’
and ‘Into a closed mouth. flies
cannot come."’ With a smile. the
self-educated labor leader confid-
ed. "I'm just beginning to know
how smart my mother was."

Asked whether he considered
non-violence a means or an end.
Chavez quoted Gandhi. "The Cre-
ator has given us control (and
that too very limited) over means.
and none over the end." the Ma-
hatma wrote. Chavez added that.
in Gandhi‘s opinion. "if we take
care of the means. we are bound
to reach the end sooner or later.“
Coupled. the two aphorisms be-

come a way of life.

Emphasizing that non-violence
is a distictly positive philosophy.
the coordinator of the grape boy-
cott bemoaned the fact that non-
violence is frequently misunder-
stood. “In this country." he lam-
ented. "people equate non-vio-
lence with fear. passivity. and in-
action. It‘s much more than that.
It's the reverse side of the coin
for action."

“Non-violence often becomes
the scapegoat for our own short-
comings,” Chavez continued. “It’s
so easy to say, ‘We tried non-vio-
lence and it didn’t work’ instead
of saying, ‘We didn’t know how to
make it work.’ It’s difficult to get
people interested in non-violence
because it involves many respon-
sibilities and many headaches,
but we must endure these things.
Non-violence is the only way we
can win the struggle to bring
about change.”

Dismissing revolution as a
counterfeit panaces. the contro-
versial champion of farm work-
ers‘ rights argued that the form of
a national government has little
to do with the plight of poor peo-
ple. “It's not the political system
that counts. Great revolutions

- have been fought for the poor. but

the poor are still pretty much in
the same boat. We‘ve had hun-
dreds of revolutions allover the
world and nothings been done.
It‘s very sad.“

Despite such a view of history.

Chavez admitted to being.optimis-
tic. '“I‘m not discouraged." he

smiled-. ‘fA lot of things are going .

power away. I think that power is

Citing his organization's efforts
to "end the injustices committed
against farm workers." Chavez
said he has "a lot of faith that it
can be done." 

The 42 year oldlcrusader stress-
ed, though, that he alone cannot
change existing conditions. “It
would be a mistake to believe that
one man is going to bring peace
and justice to this country and the
world. No one person can do it.
It’s got to be in the people’s will.
Not untilwe get more people in-

we have peace and justice.”

If not a human paradox. Cesar
Chavez.’ at the very least. is an
extraordinary individual. While
intense. he is gentle. Though pas-
sionate. he is serene. He is both
pragmatic and idealistic. He re-
lates with people. believing in
God. He effects non-violent social
change. deploring violent revolu-
tion. Acutely sensitive to his own
failings. he seldom questions the
worth and beauty of other men.

 Why Do
You Read,
So Slowly?

DOI‘ts there is a simp_lé,:technique
of rapid /reading which should

enable you "to increase your
reading speed and yet retain
much more. Most people do not
realize how much they could in-
crease their pleasure, success
and income by reading faster
and more accurately.

According to- this publisher,
many people, regardless of their
presei_it. reading skill, can use
this simple technique to improve
their reading ability to a re-
markable degree. Whether read-
mg stories, books, technical mat-
ter, it becomes possible to read
sentences at a glance and entire,
péiges in seconds with this meth-
o .

Cesar Chavez does not claim to
be great. Indeed. he squirms at
the suggestion of some that he is
a modern saint. And yet. like St.
Francis of Assisi whom he so ad-
mires. he has forsaken material
pursuits and expended himself
for other men. fasting for 25 da_vs
a winter ago and jeopardizing his
very survival. Self-doubt is a part
of Cesar Chavez. Inevitably. it is
a part of every great man. For if

the great man is an enigma to I

others. he is just as inscrutable
to himself.

5N0 Requirement 

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

l The language requirement is a subject that was discus-
sed at great length at the University last year. As a result, it
was modified to a pass-failcourse, and students have many
options during their four terms of the required, language to
take related courses to fulfill the requirement.

On Wednesday, Nov. 5, the Undergraduate Counciliwill
discuss the language requirement during its meeting Many
students were pleased with the revisions in the requirement,
but most feel there should be no requirement at all.

The Pitt News urges all students to attend Wednesday’s
meeting, which will be held in room 917,. Cathedral, at 9 a.m.,
and to express their opinions of the “why’s” and “why not’s”
of the language requirement.

V The Pitt News also urges that the language_ requirement
be abolished for the following reasons: '

(1) Forcing students to take a foreign language is against
the idea of self-determination, which this University should
practice. ’

(2) Forcing students into language courses places un-

, desirable pressures on language teachers and the few stu-

  dents in the class who are there because they want to learn the
I language.

(3) Keeping the requirement because many teaching as-
_. sistants would lose their jobs if it were dropped is not ample
v reason.

_, It was in mid-March last year
- y ' when Roy Jacobs broke the contin-
um of gung-ho Pitt football sports

what he believed to be a growing
attitude on campus to eliminate
‘ Pitt football as it has been tradi-
tionally known. to de-emphasize.

emphasized athletic programs ).

shouldn't the University use that

money. instead.’ on more worth-

need for the development of a

Black Studies Program. There

has been a need for an expanded

Social Sciences Department. There
has been a need for the Universi-
ty to develop programs with which

which it could relate to the com-
munity. There are countless re-

search projects that could be bet-

ter financed. The list of priorities

continue.

But after researching the situa-
tion at hand, it became obvious
that not only was de-esmphasis
not feasible, but there was no le-
gitimized reason for demanding
the University to de-emphasize.

The argument for de-emphasis
ijis that there is nothing wrong with
. an ‘intercollegiate athletic pro-

’ gram at the University. but that
' such a program should have a
 much smaller part of the make-up
of the University. The concern
 stems around the desire to
'”strenghten the University‘s stat-
ure as an academic community:
thattransferring the funds spent
on the athletic department to
other departments within the Uni-
versity would be in the best inter-
estof the University.

. The question of de-emphasis at
the University was the result of
five consecutive losing football
seasons. the last three of which
saw the football team win only
three of 30_ games. Given the sit-
uation that. as a result of the in-
adequate policies under which the

Editor, The Pitt News

A growing number of college

students and teachers feel the war.

in Vietnam should be stopped im-
mediately. and furthermore. that
one of the most effective ways of
voicing that opinion is by peace-
ful demonstration of anti-war sen-
timent. Yet. President Nixon has
said that he will not be influenced
by such demonstrations.

Could it be that the war affects
those of us in college much more
than it affects the
President’? To those of us in col-
lege. the war means a friend or
relative being killed.- The war

»means fellow students worrying

for years about their draft status.
The war means long talks and
thinking about the very thought of

_ having to kill or be killed.

It seems unreal that the war
could seem more real to us than
it does to the President and the
others in Washington. . '

Maybe they know something
about the impossibility of ending
the war that they aren’t telling us.
Maybe they’re just watching the
Gallup poll to see if the majority
opinion has swung over against
the war. Maybe the death tolls
are just another list of figures to
them; figures like the gross na-
tional‘ product or. foreign aid
spending figures. i

Surely the politicians in Wash-
ington can't feel the ugliness or
immorality or sickness or wrong-
ness of the war as we do. If so.

' they would have been out of Viet-"

nam. one way or another. a long
time ago. ,

To a lot of people in this coun-
try. placing a man on the moon
was a real morale boost. But how
many of those people stopped to
ask the question. "How can a
country so advanced and refined
that it can conquer the dimensions
of outer space be involved insuch
a primative and archaic practice

each of the four "previous years.
The expenses included the foot-
ball team; the 11 other varsity
sports: the intramural program:

" maintenance of Pitt Stadium. the

Field House. and Trees Hall
Swimming Pool: student » aide:
and administrative salaries. The
percentages are comparable with
those of Ivy League University of
Pennsylvania.

For all practical_purposes. the
football team more—or-less sup-
ports itself. The expected loss this
season is $137,018. and the foot-
ball team was a combined $11.-
000 in thered the two previous
seasons. But in’ 1965. when the
football team made one television
appearance. the football program
netted $155085. In 19661 football
brought in $l7.444.

The bulkof the expenses of the
athletic program is. therefore. on
other varsity sports which take
in much less money than they
spend. Last year. for instance.
while the football team was only
$95,000 plus in the red. the other
sports were‘ a combined. $604,758
in the red. The costs of the athletic
program minus football is expect-
ed to be almost $630000 this year.

If the University was to de-em-
phasize football,. the footballiyteam

as the war in Vietnam?" A war
that nobody wants to fight. A war
that is tearing the greatest coun-
try in the world apart__..at the
seams. A war that neither side
can possibly win. A war that will
eventually ruin more-' lives and
minds than all previous“wars add-
ed up. W ‘ I’

And. the anti-war sentiment
doesn’t stop on the campuses.
Ask a returning vet what he real-
ly thinks about the situation in
Vietnam. Give him a little time
and a few drinks “to forget” and
listen as he unravels a mind that
has become twisted and torn to

the point of insanity. Listen as he '

tells of how sickening it is to see
a good friend killed for nothing.
Listen as he tells of innocent peo-
ple being napalmed because Un-
cle Sam is helping them to a bet-
ter way of life. Listen as he tells
of case after caseof drug usage
behind the lines (even on the
lines)—the excuse being it distorts
the reality of needless killing. Lis-
ten as hebreaks into uncontroll-
able sobbing and pleads for some-
one to change the subject.

Does President Nixon ever hear
such accounts‘? No. He hears" gen-
erals tell of the high morale. and
of the dedication of Americas fin-
est fighting men and many other
lies that allow the Vietnam atro-
city to continue.

One thing that President Nixon
and many other people can hear

and see in the next few days. or '

weeks. or months. or years is the
voice of those of us who are al-

lowed (without fear of a‘ court ‘

martial or a jail term) to speak
openly’ and freely. That'voice is
small when taken alone. but when
added to many other small voices
it will hopefully be heard. "and
hopefully Nixon will change his

mind about not listening to anti— ,

war sentiment. ,

Stop the war in Vietnam. and
stop the war in the minds of mil-
lions of Americans.

The De-Emphasizing Football Myth

al of alumni contributions towards
the program; an inability to bring

_ in money through ticket sales and

Stadium concession stands: and
the impossibility of netting money
from television appearances (a
football team nets approximately
$150.000 for a Game-of-the-Week
appearance). '

Under a de-emphasized pro-
gram. most or all scholarships

_ would be dropped. but the elimin-

ation of those expenses would not
counter-balance the loss in in-\
come.

Therefore, if
was to de-emphasize the football
program, football expenditures
would increase; as a result, so
would the expenses of the athletic
program. De-emphasizing foot-
ball would emphasize the relative

* place of the athletic program with-

in the University.

The argument for de-emphasis
should not be directed at the Uni-
versity administration. but at the
students who blow up the impor-
tance of whether or not the foot-
ball team beats Notre Dame. It's
not hard to imagine that if the
Panthers were nationally ranked.

The Lesson:
No. Pistols,

 3 Shooting

Editor. The Pitt News:

A lesson to be drawn from your
story of the shooting in the Un-
ion is that campus security
guards would be more secure if
they did not carry firearms. If the
assailant had not got hold of the
guards pistol. there would have
_ been no shooting. An examination
of whether guards in fact require
firearms in order to carry out
their duties is called for.

fDmtishevsky

Editor. The Pitt News:

I would like to welcome Profes-
sor Danishevsky to the discus-
sion on undergraduate education
(and to sympathize with him on
the filtration of ones writing
through the Pitt News typesetting
process).

Danishevsky discovered a great
deal in.my three short paragraphs
—both more and less than were
actually there (the passage had
been excerpted by The Pitt News
from a longer document).

The issues raised by my assail-
lant are indeed important ones.
and I hope he and 1, our col-
leagues. and the students will
take the necessary time and effort
to discuss them. We certainly do
not have the answers yet. but
some of the questions are:

—What has been the role of ed-
ucated people and the educational

establishment with respect’. to‘

"Vietnam. racism. and air pollu-
tion"?

—What do we trust to the stu-
dents own decision? (Here Dan-
ishevsky and I agree that the stu-
dent must "be free to decide for
‘ himself.“ ) ~

—"Who is the scoundrel‘ who
favors impersonal instruction?"
(If there are none. why do we have
it?) Put otherwise. can we only
eliminate this evil by having smal-
ler entering classes?

—"How shall we redefine the
meaning of a B.A. or B.S. degree‘?
. ._ . Should degrees be gran-ted at
all?"

{x
(1..
\

The function of _ a polemical
statement such -as mine  pre-
cisely to engage others in the re-
appraisal which Danishevsky
"does not deny" is necessary. I
hope his next contribution will be
his suggestions for needed im-
provements in undergraduate ed-

ucation at.Pitt. and we will wel- -

come his oral or written partici-
pation in the work of the Arts and.

 Rabbi   Quéstiorrts Possible “caress” Faith 

stein acknowledges. is an acute;
enigma which most people woulliil.

V by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

Is a Godless Judaism possible?
Rabbi Richard Rubenstein dealt
with this question Thursday night.
as he spoke at Congregation B‘nai
Israel.

‘Addressing an audience of near-
ly 400 people, the acclaimed reli-
gious leader .recapulated his ex-
periences at the Jewish Theolo-
gical Seminary in New York. At
that point, 20 years ago, he main-
tained in God somewhat of a blind
faith: men’s thoughts and actions
are predestined, and whatever'oc-
curs is the best of God’s ‘inten-
tions. -

In describing such a God. the
rabbi referred to what is known
as a "God of history." The foun-
dation of Jewish existence. for
3.300 years. rested on this God.
When the Bablylonians conquered
Palestine and ousted the Jews. it
was He who intervened.

The prophets, in consoling the
people, perceived this as punish-
ment—the Jews had transgress-
ed, and now God was condemning
them. To regain His favor, the
prophets advised, //they must re-
pent. «'

Without this understanding,
Jews would have disappeared, for
returning to God gave them some-
thing in common, and consequent-
ly. held them together.

Rabbi Rubenstein accepted this
view without scruple until a dras-
tic event forced him to re-examine
his beliefs. His ailing son had died,
thus putting him in a dilemma.
For the first time, _he questioned
God’s will.

But circumstances even more
perplexing puzzled him —' namely
Auschwitz. If there is truly a God.
how could he allow the slaughter
of six million Jews?

“I cannot believe,” the rabbi af-
firmed, “in any God in any way

he asserted, and that is exactly,

Now that the State is, firmly
rooted, Jews must consider, what
the rabbi referred to, a “sacred
bond.” He stressed the role of the
synagogue in uniting Jewish peo-
ple. So many important occasions,

Riflers Aim For Better

Not since the days of Sports
Editor Myron Kopelman has
the varsity rifle squad made
the upper-right-hand corner of the
first sports page in the Pitt News.
Last Friday. they proved that
they‘re still trying though.

That spot in the paper is re-

There was one at the match
against Duquesne. and the chick
proved chicken. bringing» a rifle

Now, before Mary McFeeley’s

parents read this and come to_
take her off the rifle team, it’s'

only fair to tell you that Mary
wasn't the belly dancer. The mini-
skirted invader was Mike Simode-
jka.

"I was there to motivate them."
he stated. not indicating which
team needed the aid. "Everything
was going fine until some one
showed up with a ping"

Well. for those‘ people getting a
little worried about Mike. another
explanation is desired.

“There was just this other guy.
He was a “Happy Jim." We were

do it." the ex-belly dancer noted
during the competition.

The sharpshooters continued to
fire for more points than the op-

locker room, Orange coach Ben
Schwartzwalder would make no alibis. “We just got licked
by a better team,” moaned the veteran Syracuse mentor.
Schwartzwalder also praised DePasqua and his staff for a
coaching victory. “Well,.all _I can say is Carl has got to be
given a lot of credit. He came back a long way in one week’s
time,” continued Schwartzwalder.

The Panther victory was their third of the season, and

the most since 1965. The win over Syracuse marks the first

- time that a Panther team has whipped the Orangemen

since 1963, when the Jungle Cats finished third in the na-

tion. The third victory of the season also equals the total
number of wins amassed over the last three seasons.

Tailback Denny Ferris was voted the outstanding play-
er of the game as he rushed for 197 yards against a Syra-
cuse defense rated fifth in the nation going into the game’.
Ferris also caught four passes for 89 yards and scored

The 107 yards rushing was the ‘most for Ferris this
"season and the game marked the second time thatthe- jun-

outstanding effort. “The entire defense was great,” he ex-
claimed. Middle linebacker. Ralph Cindrich turned in an-
other outstanding performance, with six individual tackles ,,
and six assists. But what makes his performance more 
amazing is the Cindrich hadn’t.practiced’ all week and as

Senior ‘linebacker Geoff Brown also had an outstand-
ing game, matching Cindrich’s six tackles’ and six assists,

Two Second Quarter

TDS Produce Upset

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor
The final two minutes of the Panther’s 21-20‘ upset of the
Syracuse Orangemen Saturday were enough to shatter anyone’s
nerves. A last minute loss to Tulane two weeks ago couldn’t be

forgotten.

But after Coach Carl DePasqua’s Jungle Cats had held on
for the victory,a quick reflection indicated that the final two
minutes of the first half were the big moments for the Panthers.

. The Orange took a" 14-7 lead with 1:58 left in the half on a

_ Randy Zur to Tony Gabriel touchdown aerial, topping off an 80-
yard drive. The Panthers were apparently ready to drop out of
the game, like so many times in the last few years.

Suddenly, though, a familiar
face haunted the Orange coach,
Ben Schwartzwalker. Dave Gar-
‘nett, who bypassed Syracuse to
play for the Panthers, returned a
George Jakowenko kickoff 66
yards to the Orange 31-yard line.

An 18-yard pass from Jim Frie-
(ii to George Medich and a nine-
yard screen pass to Steve Moyer
moved the Cats to the two-yard
line.

When a running play failed to
produce a TD. the Panthers quick-
ly lined up and Friedl tossed to
Moyer in the end zone before the

“‘~\_,_Orange knew what had happened.

A moment later Syracuse was
stunned again. The Panthers set-
up for the extra point, but faked
the kick. Frank Gustine lofted a
two-point aerial to Geroge'Med-
ich who was all alone in the end
zone, and the Panthers snagged
the lead, 15-14.

Then. with less than a minute
remaining in the opening half.
Dave Dibbley intercepted one of
Zur's passes and raced to the
Orange 15-yard line.

After a dela_\l'-of-the-game pen-
alty. Friedl fired up the middle to
_ Denny Ferris. and Ferris outleg—
ged a handful of defenders around
the right side of the field for an-
other Cat TD. The Panthers led.
21-14. with 19 ‘seconds left
in the half.

». Despite the Panther’s inability

_ to score in the final half, the ,_Cats

had secured a victory. The only
second-half tallies the ‘ Orange
could obtain came on two third
quarter field ‘goals by Jakewenko,
after the Panther defesne stiffen-
ed following a blocked punt and a
short, 14-yard punt by Joe Spicko.
"This is thegreatest win I‘ve

had in all my life." DePasqua
said after the game. "The guys did

a great job. We could see it in
practice. and the guys carried the
fight to them.

“When the offense bogged down.
the defense picked up. and when
the defense bogged down the of-
fense picked up.“

The offense musthave surprised
Schwartzwalder. The Orange pass
defense was the third best in the
nation going into the game. And
their total defense was ranked
fifth.

"I guess the pass defense kind
of went down the drain. particu-
larly against the screen." the
Orange coach noted.

The Panthers seemed to have
little trouble connecting on the
short pass patterns that DePas-
qua has instituted this fall. Friedl
completed 10 of 29 T flings for
186 yards.
