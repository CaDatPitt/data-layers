Despite traffic trouble
parking construction
proceeding smoothly

By Chris Studebaker
For The Pitt News

Construction of the new parking
garage under the front lawn of
Soldiers 8r Sailors Memorial Hall
in Oakland should be completed
by May 1991, according to officials
at the National Development
Corporation.

“Everything is going as
expected,” said Steve Tassaro,
vice president of National
Development, which is
overseeing the project. “We hope
to be done in about 10 to 12
months.”

When the $17-million, four-
story, 950-space garage is
completed, it will be operated by
the University of Pittsburgh, which
has agreed to a 45-year lease with
the county. For the first ﬁve years,
Pitt will pay the county an annual
fee of $250,000. The sum will be
compounded annually for the
following 10 years. At the 16th
year the annual fee will be

Approximately 70 people
showed up for a rally in David L.
Lawrence Hall last night in
support of an effort to get U.S.
troops out of Panama.

The event was sponsored by
the Central American Peace
Coalition (CAPCO). Tracy Castro,
speaking for CAPCO, praised the
crowd for coming.

“I am extremely impressed by
the turnout tonight,” she said.
“Many people have said that

$300,000, which will remain the
same until the 45th year of the
lease. ,

At the end of the 45th year the
university will have the option to
enter a new lease with the county,
T assaro said.

So far this winter the weather
has interfered little with
construction, said Jim Cortez, a
representative of National
Development. “The bitter cold
temperatures in December
caused a short delay in digging,
but the warm weather last week
helped us get back on schedule,”
he added.

Now that the outside walls are
completed, steps to lay the
foundation of the garage will
begin within the next few weeks.
Unfortunately, that means more
trucks slowing traffic down on
Fifth Avenue. ‘

According to Walter Waters,
assistant public safety director at
Pitt, the great number of
construction vehicles that travel

nobody cares about the invasion
anymore, but I guess we showed
them wrong.” Castro also said
that many people who had passed
by CAPCO’s booth in the lobby
of the William Pitt Union tore up
and threw away much of the
literature that the group was
passing out.

Castro then introduced Mark
Ginsburg, director of the Institute
of International Studies and
Education at Pitt. Ginsburg gave
a mock news report, saying that
Washington, D.C. had been
invaded by a group of

mercenaries, who had
parachuted onto the White House
lawn. He reported that 200,000
Americans had been killed in this
invasion, and that 1.5 million had
been wounded. S

Ginsburg then stated that the
mission of this force had been to
capture and bring back a drug
trafficker for trial. The drug
trafficker, he claimed, “was
George Bush." At the time of the
rally, the “force” was “cleaning
up the situation.” He also said
that Bush was “hiding somewhere
in a mosque for protection.”

He said that the United States
invaded Panama because they
wanted to look good abroad.
“The United States might have to
get out of Panama to live up to
the Panama Canal treaty,”
Ginsburg said. “Washington, D.C.
is violating that treaty." He then
called the troops in Panama a
“mercenary force.”

“It is getting harder to mobilize
people in America against
imperialism,” Ginsburg told the
crowd.

to and from the site have caused
traffic to be heavier than normal
in that area.

“Traffic in Oakland is pretty
bad during rush hour, but with
the trucks it [is] worse,” said
Waters, adding that he

understands the trucks have to
be there, and the university has
not received any complaints about
the construction.

For safety reasons, barriers have
been built around the perimeter

of the site. According to Cortez,
the barriers will probably remain
for the duration of the
construction. Waters said that no
complaints about the barriers have
been made, noting that they are
important in preventing injuries.

Pitt groups dispel AIDS myths through education

 

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Though Pitt’s Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance sponsored yesterday’s AIDS Lobby
Day at Pitt, the group chose not to display
its name at its information table in the
William Pitt Union.

“This issue is too important to be clouded
by the prejudice that people have towards
our group. If we had put our name on the
table, people wouldn’t have come by,”
said Mark Smith, co-president of BiGALA.

BiGALA’s activities were in support of
yesterday’s Rally and Lobby Day for
confidentiality held in Harrisburg. The
American Civil Liberties Union sponsored
this day to push for the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives to vote on the
Confidentiality of HIV—Related Information
Act, which passed unanimously in the
Senate in October but has yet to come up

for a vote in the House.

“We collected signatures for the bill
because it’s important for people who [are
tested for AIDS] to be free from
discrimination,” Smith said.

The bill, if passed, would guarantee the

someone may face after being tested.
Someone might be discriminated against
not only in the instance that the test comes
out positive, but also [if] it turns out
negative. People will make the assumption
that just because you ’ve been tested you’re

confidentiality of HIV—related medical
records and provide for pre— and post—test
counseling about the facts of the virus.

“Maintaining confidentiality is very‘

important because [of the] problems that

at risk,” said Jan DeVoe, a nurse/health
educator at Pitt’s Forbes Clinic.

BiGALA also passed out AIDS literature
and free condoms at their table.

“It is incredible how ignorant some

people are about AIDS,” Smith said.

While Smith was speaking, a male
student came to the table and said, “Well,
is the bill to lock those people up, or what?
They should put all of those people in one
place so they don’t spread it.”

Smith said he was not surprised by the
student’s comments. “This is a prime
example of the ignorance and
misinformation about AIDS,” he said.

Smith said that he was trying to stress
the importance of education about AIDS
among women by his use of the literature.

“A lot of women think that just because
they are on the pill they are fine, but the
truth is that they are not protected against
AIDS,” he said.

DeVoe agreed that women need to take
precautions against AIDS.

“A woman is as much at risk as anyone.
This is no longer a problem for just gay
men and drug users," she said.

Pitt awarded transplant grant

By Toni Crary
Staff Writer

Researchers from Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public Health
have been awarded more than
$5 million to coordinate a national
liver—transplant data base
following four years of extensive
research.

The seven—year study, which
will be conducted by members
of the epidemiology data center,
is headed by Dr. Katherine Detre,
who is also the director of the Pitt
data center. The database will
accumulate comprehensive
medical and psychosocial data
on transplant candidates and
recipients.

“We want to find out more
about the unknowns of liver
transplantations such as who
benefits the most, optimal time
in [the] course of [the] disease to
operate, clinical testing and
rejection,” said Detre.

Detre stressed that the

program’s main function is
uniformity. In a pilot test on 20
liver-transplant patients, Detre,
colleagues in Pittsburgh and
researchers from five transplant
centers set up the model for the
method they are currently using.

Detre added, “Standardization
and uniformity is the key to our
program. There is no set program
anywhere today that can be used.
Our program will analyze all the
information in a uniform fashion
so that any research center can
use it."

“With a network like this, it’s
not just the information. The
researchers get closer, which is
useful for collaborative research
in exchanging ideas and
problems,” she added.

After receiving the funding from
the National Institute of Health,
the Pitt researchers will now

implement the collection of
standardized, accurate and
uniform information on

approximately 1,000 patients. By

following these patients for five
years, the researchers intend to
set new goals related to the long-
term effects of liver transplants.
The new methods will also be
used to quickly test new drugs,
organ preservation solutions and
surgical techniques.

Detre also said that a lot of
emphasis will be placed on
clinical trials and how the patients
are doing in the outside
community.

Pitt investigators working with
Detre include Dr. A. Jake
Demetris, assistant professor of
pathology, Pitt School of
Medicine; Steven Belle, Ph.D.,
assistant professor of
epidemiology, and Sheryl Kelsey,
Ph.D., associate professor of
epidemiology, both from the

Paper recycling plan
begins in Forbes Quad

By Iarry Chough
For the Pitt News

The university’s Facilities Management has provided paper-
waste containers beside the general waste cans for all desks on
the fourth and fifth floors, all of the computer centers and the
GSPIA department in the Forbes Quadrangle.

Only certain kinds of waste paper are to be disposed of in
these containers. The paper will then be recycled. Each
container has an information sticker stipulating which kinds of
paper can be recycled.

According to Robert Boyce, executive assistant of Physical
Plant Operations, the implementation of a recycling program
represents the university’s initiative on state House Bill 101,
which will require municipalities to cut all forms of specified
waste by 25 percent. Specific guidelines will be set by city and
county officials by September of this year. Boyce sees the
project, which has been in existence for over three weeks, “as
sort of a jump on the impending situation."

The Facilities Management department already works in
conjunction with the Pitt organization CLEAN by providing 12
waste receptacles for aluminum at various locations throughout

Russian artist's Work on display in Union Panama

By Iaurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

In the Soviet Union a person is
appreciated for art and talent.
However, to have artwork
exposed beyond the communist
lands is quite difficult.

This week the Pitt Program

' Council, with the help of the

Fusion Art Distribution, displays
the art of the Ukranian born
graphics artist Simon Shkolnik.
His work can be viewed from
Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 in the Gallery of
the William Pitt Union. The exhibit
is free and open to the public.
“Russian artists have one
common plea; to have their art
exhibited in the United States.
There are many talented Soviet
artists and it is very hard for them
to have their works exhibited,”
said Sergei Matveiev, Fusion Art

Distribution owner. “It is not
always what you know, it is who
you know.”

According to Matveiev,
Shkolnik began his education at
Kiev’s High School of Art, where
he was interested in painting and
drawing. After graduation, he
served in the Soviet Army from
1964 through 1967. In 1976,
Shkolnik finished his formal
education from the Ivan Franko
Printing Institute. Shkolnik, 45,
presently works in the genres of
political and social issues.

The exhibit presents many
examples of his graphic poster
art and also several personal
works of water colors and acrylics.
Beyond the Soviet Union, his
work has been viewed in
Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Germany, France and New York’s
United Nations, according to

Matveiev. Shkolnik won a first
place international award in the
International Poster Contest, “For
Peace and Social Progress.”

Matveiev said he gained his
personal interest of Soviet art
through his father Ivan Flagin, a
Russian poet and Pitt professor of
Russian literature.

Matveiev pointed out a self
portrait of Shkolnik which
included an actual newspaper
clipping during the time he served
in the Soviet Army. The portrait
was of Shkolnik dressed in his
army attire with his painting
supplies around him, perhaps a
way in which he woulddeﬁnitely
want to be remembered.

“In the Soviet Union, it is very
prestigious to be an artist, an
educator or a poet. It is most
prominent in the USSR and it is

See Art, page 7

Remember the time of your life

If you've signed up for a senior portrait, remember that they are
being taken this week in room 609 of the, William Pitt Union. Men
should wear a jacket and tie; women should wear a long-sleeved
blouse. There is a $4 sitting fee, which goes to fund the yearbook. If
you have questions, please go to room 430, or call 648-7842.

member of the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador (CISPES), focused his

. attacks on the American reasons

for the invasion.
“The actual reason why the
United States invaded Panama
\was because Noriega stopped
agreeing with them,” Schell said.
“Bush always knew, even when
he was head of the CIA, that he
was dealing with a drug dealer.”
He also said that President Bush
has “manipulated the media to
make Noriega look bad,”
comparing Noriega to Libyan
strongman Mohammar Khadafy.
“Bush has made Noriega into
another Khadafy by turning
‘American sentiment against him,”

Schell said.

Also speaking was Carlos
Fitzgerald, a
graduate student in anthropology
at Pitt. Fitzgerald was in Panama
at the time of the invasion, and
called it “a horrible act.” He then
thanked the crowd for “showing
that the American people are in
solidarity with the Panamanians.”

Fitzgerald called the invasion
“a breach of the principle of non-
intervention.”

He then criticized the American
government for turning Panama
into a puppet state. “What the
United States government says,
the Panamanian government
does," Fitzgerald said. “As
Americans, you should elect
people who can do better.”

    Unfavorable rating system

I Last week the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business
and Industry privately circulated a rating system_ of
Pennsylvania lawmakers that is believed to have

. prompted angry legislators to postpone hearings on a

bill that would protect state corporations from hostile
takeovers. The rating system, based on business-
related votes of legislators, caused an uproar among
House Democrats, many of whom received very low
marks. . -~

. Chairman of the House Business and Commerce
Committee Rep. Fred B. Taylor, who declared the
postponement of the anti-takeover bill, stated that he
did so because proponents and opponents needed
more time to prepare testimony. Several House members
privately said otherwise. Rep.‘ Ron Gamble, D-Oakdale,
who received a marking of 62, the highest among

, House Democrats, linked the postponement to the

release of the ratings, saying “T here’s no doubt about
it; it was poor timing on [the Chamber’s] part, consid-

ering the legislation they want passed.” I

The next-highest ranking among Allegheny County
Democrats was a‘ 54, given to Rep. Brian Clark, who
just missed the 55 “passing” score needed for chamber
endorsement. Some House Democrats, such as repre-
sentatives Frank Pistella, Allen Kukovich and David
Levdansky, received negative scores.

The spokesman for the chamber, advocating and
defending the rating system, stated, .“It’s important to
have an objective way of determining who our mem-
bers should support politically.”

The disgruntled congressmen should not let this
rating system interfere with their legislative duties as
state representatives. T 0 do so would be a despicable
act signaling what voters fear most: the obligations of
congressmen playing second fiddle to personal politi-
cal affiliations.

It would be especially sickening if the angry legisla-
tors didn’t pass the anti—takeover bill to protest the
rating system. After all, why would they postpone
hearings on the bill? Are they conspiring to retaliate as
a type of retribution or punishment against the cham-
ber for its rating system? We doubt it, but keep your
eyes open anyway.

_ This action of protest by the congressmen also makes
them look like big babies: “Well, if you don’t like how
I vote, then I just won’t vote.” ‘

No congressman is exempt from criticism. In fact,

they should be accustomed to it and welcome it.

‘ Constructive criticism opens public eyes and makes a

better, more productive and efficient congressman. It
was founding father James Madison's vision that
American political ideology be modeled on a pluralist
democracy fashion; dissenting political views by inter-
est groups are necessary to keep a healthy democratic
society.

This rating system sends a crucial message to resi-
dents of a state economically downtrodden by an

‘ aging and disappearing steel and coal industry} this is

how your congressman votes on business-related
matters.

The criticism and objections over the rating system
by these state legislators‘ seems to portend that they
gave something to hide from their constituents. Do

I found myself in a very precarious
moral dilemma recently. Two of my
strongest moral convictions were
pitted against one another when I
was asked to respond to a question
where I was expected to disregard
my opposition to the death penalty
—— to simply accept it as the maxi-
mum penalty of the law —- and

decide whether rape and child mo-’

lestation should be crimes’punish-
able by death. This was for me an
extremely complicated and difficult
question to answer. While I find the

concept of capital punishment com-

pletely reprehensible, I know of
nothing more vile, than rape or child
abuse in any form. It is my opinion
that murderers show their victims
more mercy than do either of these
two categories of criminals.

I thought for a very long time and
changed my opinion several times
before. coming to a conclusion. I
decided that I could not stand behind
a judge’s decision to sentence a per-
son to death, regardless of his or her
crime. I believe instead that every sex
offender and child abuser should
spend the remainder of his or her life

in prison without the remotest possi-

bility of parole.

Now, with the recent court case
against Elbert Powell, convicted of
sexually abusing a 6-year-old girl, the
concept. of castration has been rein-
troduced to the judicial system’ by
Judge Gilfert M. Mihalich. '

According to Mihalich, “If you elimi-
nate that sexual urge, I think it elimi-
nates the menace.” Mihalich seems to

be ignorant of the fact that rape
is a violent crime, not a sexual
one. Eliminating Powell’s sexual
drive would not eliminate his
violent tendencies or his ability
to commit further violent crimes.

Powell has a history of sexual
and other_ criminal offenses.
Castration is a dangerously naive

 

  Mindy
Boffemmyer

and shortsighted approach to the
problem. As a judge, it is Mihal-
ich’s responsibility to protect the
safety of the public. Castration
would not prevent Powell from
sexually abusing other children.
Sentencing him to life in prison
would.

I believe that, if appealed to a
higher court, Mihalich’s decision
would be thrown out as cruel
and unusual punishment. That
decision would please me, as
castration is not only cruel and
unusual punishment, but also an

ineffective means of dealing with
a horrible problem.

The effects of rape and moles-
tation are devastating-to their
adult victims. To a child, with no
prior concept of such perversi-
ties, nor the understanding that
they are not to blame, these
effects can be debilitating.

As adults, we are capable of

taking some precautions to pro-
tect ourselves from these crimes.
Children are not. They are fre-
quently left in the care of virtual
‘strangers such as schoolteach-
ers, baby sitters and religious
instructors," and are physically
defenseless against their adult
attackers.

It is our responsibility to pro-
tect children. Keeping known
sex offenders in prison where
‘they have no occasion to repeat
their crimes is one effective step
toward fulﬁlling that obligation.

I am thoroughly disgusted with
Mihalich’s sentence. Moreover, I
am disgusted by the fact that
someone with such an unedu-
cated view of so serious a crime
couldbe a judge. Especially when
he had a realistic solution at his
disposal. A

Let Powell die in prison. Apart
from electrocution, this is the
only way we can be certain he
will never be given the opportu-
nity to abuse another child.

Some albums should be labeled

I am writing in response to the
results of a survey which was pub-
lished in Tbe Pitt News concerning
the state approving warning labels
on record albums. It bothers me that
over 50 percent of my peers believe
putting labels on records should be
restricted.

Well, let me introduce that over-
whelming majority to a band named
Pussy Galore! The other day I was
visiting a friend who is a DJ. atWPT S.
I was glancing through the record
collection when this band just jumped
out at me. Some of the songs on this
album called Comely are “Kill Your-
self,” “Dead Meat," “Teen Pussy

Power” and “Die Bitch”; there
were other songs but none that
can be printed in The Pitt News.
This album was produced in 1987

 

by Vinyl Drip Int. I do not believe
there is anything wrong with free
expression; in fact, bands should
be encouraged to express them-
selves in anyway they want to.
However, albums such as this

one should be banned from the
radio and not sold to individuals
under 18 years of age. I believe
that if young people listen to this
music too much, they may start
to act it out. This album and
other ones like it should be placed
in a special section in record
stores in the same fashion that
pornographic movies are placed
in video stores. If anyone is in
disagreement with me, please
feel free to contact me, and I’ll let
you listen to the album!

Board monitors profs’ studies

~ By Pat Naughton

For The Pitt News

Many students at Pitt are propositioned by
one of their professors to participate in a research
project in exchange for course credit.

“Lots and lots of faculty try to use students as
normal subjects in their research projects,”
explained Dr. Richard L. Cohen, professor
emeritus of child psychiatry and chairman of the
Biomedical Institutional Review Board for the
University of Pittsburgh.

The Biomedical‘ IRB tries to put a stop to
professors who bargain with their students in
this manner. “The whole point is professors
should not be giving students credit in these

. instances,” Cohen said. “[The students] are being
exploited.”

The Biomedical IRB reviews all research
activities which involve drugs, X-rays, radioaaive
materials or physical manipulations in people,
whether or not they are hospitalized. The IRB’s
primary purpose is to protect patients and
experimental subjects from unwarranted, undue
risks. It determines whether all reasonable
safeguards have been taken to protect patients.

For example, Cohen explained, “Some projects

involve exercise stress. Would a physician be
immediately available if the patient [got] into
difficulty?” Concrete answers are needed to
these kinds of questions before a project can
receive IRB approval.

In one case, a study was submitted to test the
effects of the use of marijuana on driving. The
project was disapproved.

“How do you do that?” Cohen asked. “How do
you control where they are going to drive? What
are the dangers of getting addicted to the drug?
Is it worth doing anyway? Besides, it’s against
the law.”

The researcher submitted it again, saying he’d
use a driving range. It was denied a second time.
He tried a third time, saying he’d only use
people who are marijuana smokers. It was
rejected once more, and he wasn’t heard from
again.

“There wasn’t enough potential gain in the
project to warrant the risk involved,” Cohen
said. .

A project to study the family dynamics of
violent parents was once submitted. It called for
the use of child actors trained to provoke
parents into violence according to a prearranged

quite different here in the United
States. In the states, a doctor is
looked upon as a prominent
figure," Matveiev said.

Matveiev feels that Shkolnik ‘s
work is very powerful and the
colors he uses are intended to be
shocking. Matveiev added that
Shkolnik uses some forms of
French impressionism and also
contemporary abstract art.

“Some forms are very different,
meaning they are very typical
Russian. You look at one painting
which appears to be from the
18th century, however, it is right
outside of a Russian town today.

It is as if you are stepping into
another century,” Matveiev said.

He added, “I have a good eye
for art and I like being involved.
If it is pleasing to your eye it
doesn’t make any difference what
anyone else thinks."

Matveiev wants to preserve the
Russian culture and heritage. He
thinks of the United States as a
melting pot where, especially in
Pittsburgh, there are many Russian
descendants.

Matveiev hopes to display many
works of various Russian artists
in the United States in the near
future.

IRB

Continuedfrom page 7
script.

“No, thank you," said Cohen.
This project was also disapproved

The IRB reviews human-subject
research projects for Presbyterian-
University ‘Hospital, Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,
Falk Clinic, Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Institute and
the Graduate School of Public
Health.

Project descriptions are due
two weeks prior to the monthly
meetings, and “no exceptions will
be- made,” according to IRB
guidelines.

One chairman, two vice
chairmen and 28 full board
members form the Biomedical
IRB. Of the 28, 24 are medical
professionals; all physicians and
faculty members employed by
the university. Two are health
lawyers, and two are clergymen.

Biomedical IRB emergencies,
called compassionate clearances,
occur about once a week. The
drugs and procedures used in
this instance are very‘ riskyand
almost always apply to a single
patient.

For Cohen, these are the
toughest calls, no matter the time
because he must decide, on the
spot, whether or not a’, drug or
specific treatment should be
approved.

“It’s 3 o’clock in the morning,

the patient’s dying and the
pharmacy will not release an

experimental drug without IRB

approval. The chairman has to ‘

ask enough questions to find out
whether this is warranted and
whether the risks have been fully
explained to the patient or [his or
her] family. If so, verbal
permission is given and must be
followed up in writing. But, by
the time you do this, it’s all over
[the patient has died or has moved
out of critical condition],” Cohen
explained. A

Cohen is also responsible for
the IRB’s more routine reviews.

Full-board reviews are most
typical and involve risk. A small
subgroup of three is appoinned

to review the project in detail

and report the findings at the

V monthly meetings.

Expedited reviews, projects
previously approved by the entire
board, and full—board reviews
make up 95 percent of the
workload.

Another category, exempt
research reviews, is carried out
on projects exempt from federal
requirements. They involve

research _ on blood and tissue.
samples or other body parts that
are removed from the patient.

There is no risk involved.

After ushering the board
through each review, Cohen
leads them to the decisions:
approve, approve with
modifications or disapprove.
Votes do not have to be
unanimous.

“Most things are approved with

modiﬁcations," said Cohen. “But
my own philosophy, with rare
exception, isthat where there are
still unanswered questions, or if
one board member is not satisfied,
I want to know why.

“If I think the question is
unreasonable or so picky that it’s
irrelevant, then I’ll try to talk the
person out of it or use the group
pressure to talk the person out of
it,” Cohen said; _

Researchers, at times, demand
immediate answers from Cohen.
Egos are usually involved.

“I try not to give them special
privileges, which some are used

to. I try to recognize them for the
work they do and appeal to their
sense of fairness and good
science,” said Cohen.

After having spent 35 years in
one specialty, child psychiatry,
Cohen was appointed chairman
of the IRB in 1984 by the senior
vice president for the health
sciences, Nathan Stark. Cohen
said that the appointment
sounded fascinating and would
be a good change of pace.

Cohen livens conversation with
bouts of humor. His incredible
energy level keeps him active, as
he writes books and functions as

president-elect of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry
managing the IRB

The most rewarding aspect of
IRB service for Cohen is the

The Pitt Lady Panthers, playing without
leading scorer Lorri Johnson, bowed to
Providence College 101-90 last night at
Fitzgerald Field House, dropping their
third Big East game in a row before a
crows of 118.

The hosts hung tough against the Lady
Friars’ full-court press throughout much
of the first half, but evenutally Providence
was able to pull away via turnovers in the
second half.

Providence improved to 15-4 overall
(7-3 in the Big East) while Pitt dropped to

Consistency.

That will be the_ key for the Pitt
Panthers and the Boston College
Eagles as they enter tonight’s Big
East match—up at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The Panthers are coming off a
100-92 win against the formerly
17th-ranked Arizona Wildcats this
past Saturday; Pitt is now 1-5 in
the Big East and 7-10 overall.
Boston College is 0-8 in the Big
East and 6-12 overall.

Another term for this game
maybe the battle for eighth place.

“The main thing we have to do
is not to let down,” said Pitt
center Bobby Martin. “The
Arizona game was then; this is
now. We have to go out there
tonight and just play hard and
consistent basketball.”

“We have to stay in a good state
oftmind,” said Pitt forward Rod
Brookin, who returned Saturday
from a shoulder injury by scoring
21 points in 27 minutes. “This
team is coming here to beat us.
We had mental lapses against
Syracuse, and then against
Arizona we didn’t. We just have
to stay consistent.” '

Last year the Eagles came to
town with a team that would go
on to win only three Big East
games, and unexpectedly the
Panthers ended up being one of

11-10 (36).

“We knew they were going to press,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said. “We just
didn’t handle it well.

“The way we wanted to attack it was
to handle it, to just attack the press and
score off of it. And when we did do that,
we got easy layups most of the time.”

Bruce’s squad had to do without
Johnson, an All-American candidate, for
the evening,. Johnson is suffering from
arthritis in her right knee that dates back
to the major reconstrucitvesurgery that
she had on the joint three years ago.

“Let’s face it, we think we have a
better shot at winning games with Lorri in

PAGE 10

there,” Bruce said. “You’d be a fool to
think otherwise. —
“But I also like to think that these girls
can respond to U ohnson’s absencel.”
After coming back from a 7-0 deficit
and then trading baskets with Providence
for the first eight minutes of the half, Pitt
showed signs of solving the PC press. Jen
Shingler, who would make Pitt history
later in the game when she scored her
1,000th career point, hit two free throws to
give Pitt its first lead with just under
thirteen minutes left.
After Providence forward Tracy Lis
missed a pair of free throws, Pitt point
guard Maureen McConnell canned a

jumper to start the Lady Panthers on a 19-

The Lady Friars then made nine of
twelve free throws to whittle away the
Pitt lead to 35-52.

Eventually Providence forward Cheryl
Daudel hit a layup to give the Lady Friars
a one-point lead. PC then went on a 21-
15 run to close out the half.

Providence came out on fire to begin
the second half, as Helen Mency hit a
three—point shot and Andrea Mangum,
who led Providence with a game high 24
points, made a layup for a 60-48 lead.

those three victories in a 95-85
loss at home. Dana Barros, now
of the Seattle Supersonics, had a
phenomenal game, setting a Big
East record by shooting nine of
16 from three—point land and
scoring a career high of 43 points.

“They have a lot of young,
talented players, butl don’t think
they have anyone as good as
Barros,” Martin said.

“We have to come out and give
120 percent. BC is capable of
beating anyone. [Eagles head
coach Jim] O'Brien has been
trying different things and
different combinations. They’re
looking for consistency,” Brookin
said.

The Eagles are a very young
team. Their roster includes six
freshmen and nine sophomores.

They lost six members from last
year’s team, including starters
Barros and Steve Benson. The
recruiting class included 6—foot—
8-inch forward Michael Reese
from Washington, D.C., and 7-
foot—2—inch center Randy
Hagerdon from Warwick, N.Y.
Other starters for the Eagles
include center Corey Beasley,
forward Doug Able (who also

leads the team in scoring with
11.9 ppg), Bobby Moran and
Bryan Edwards.

“If we get a lot more of a
defensive effort from everyone,
myself especially, and we make
our foul shots, along with having
a little more patience in our
offense, we can be there at the
end,” said Brookin. “We are a
couple points away from being

one of the top teams in the Big
East.”

Panther Notes:

The game time has been
changed from 7 p.m., as printed
on the ticket, to 9 p.m. to fit into
ESPN’s broadcasting schedule.
The game will be blacked out in
a 55-mile radius of the city.

Brookin is scheduled to start.

Feline family meets in Missouri to test gymnastic skills

Byjohn Iabriola
Staff Writer

Cougars, and Tigers and Wildcats, oh
my!

But what about Panthers?

Well, they’ll be there too, at the Purina
Cat Classic.

The Lady Panther gymnastics team has
been invited to the 10th annual Purina Cat
Classic, sponsored by none other than
Purina Cat Chow.

‘IClO08CAIICDAOQDIIr3DJJ.On.l0.IJ.O.IQJ.l0>1k0JA0ﬂJO&4ﬁ.IJJ).l'JQJJIJDJDJ5,0-b.D3J»C.I,IO.R¢ﬁJ’J’

What is the Purina Cat Classic, you ask?
Well, about 10 years ago, the head coach
of the University of Missouri decided he
wanted to host an invitational with some
of the top women’s gymnastics teams in
the country.

The only catch was that all the teams
participating in the meet had to have team
mascots from the cat family. In addition to
Pitt, this year’s event will include the
Missouri Tigers, the Arizona Wildcats, the
Kentucky Wildcats and the Brigham Young

Cougars.

“Over the years, this meet has become,
next to the national championships  the
most prestigious meet in the country,” said
Ben Rovee, assistant coach for the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team.

Each year, ﬁve teams from around the
country are invited to compete; if a team
loses, it is not invited back the following
year. A

This year Rovee feels that although Pitt’s
squad will not win the invitational, they

will play the role of spoiler for at least two
of the other teams competing.

“We’re going into this meet with the
idea that we will return there next year to
compete again,” said Rovee. “We're not
going to lose this meet.”

The Classic will begin at 7 p.m. on
Friday, Feb. 2 with team championships.
The top eight competitors will then
advance into the individual championships
held at 7 p.m. on Saturday.

In the past few weeks we have
been treated to many debates
over who is the better team: the
Steelers of the 1970s or the 49ers
of the 1980s. There have been
newspaper columns and radio
and television programs devoting
much time to this hotly contested
topic.

Who cares?

While it does make for some
interesting barroom chatter, that’s
about the extent of its value. I
couldn’t care less if the “steel
curtain” would stop Montana and
company. The Steelers and the

49ers each dominated a decade.
Why does everybody and his
brother have to analyze who is
the better team?

They're never going to play
each other, so we’ll never know
who is “better.” I don’t know why
we can’t just appreciate greatness
and not worry about who is
greater.

Thanks to the current age of
computers, we are now given
new means of comparison. ESPN
recently played the “Dream
Season,” in which past Super
Bowl winners duked it out on a

Dream teams of the past irrelevant in modern day Sports

Recently the same folks who
prepared the results for ESPN
matched up the 1978 Steelers and
the 1989 49ers. The Steelers won
by a score of 26-23. Big deal. This
is in no way an indication of what
would actually happen.

Pretty soon they’l1 start having
computer match-ups of the biggest
losing teams. There will be a
dream Super Bowl to see who
would lose between the Vikings
and the Broncos. Maybe there
will be a computer World Series
between the Red Sox and the

Cubs to see which team would

choke.
These silly arguments are not
limited to just football or even

team sports. Many boxing experts  0

like to fight over how Mike Tyson
would do against the boxers of
the good old days.

One common debate centers
around who is the better hitter:
Ty Cobb or Wade Boggs. The
old-time baseball fans say Cobb
was at a disadvantage because he
wasn’t aided by a lively baseball
and a custom—made thin—handled

bat.

Gymnasts finish
strong in tourney

By Sharon Kerestes
For the Pitt News

The men's gymnastics team might have compared its day to
its overall performance this’ past Saturday. They finished a
disappointing second place to William and Mary College in the
preliminary team competition but rebounded in the ﬁnals with
an impressive individual performance.

William and Mary scored 248.45 to win the meet, followed by
Pitt (245), James Madison University (227.80) and Radford
University (212.65). T

“Our scores in the ﬁnals reflected the talent that we have on
this team,” said assistant coach Jorge Sanchez, .“whereas in the
prelirns we weren’t that ready. We expected more out of
ourselves than maybe was possible for our first meet.

“We just didn't put it together in the prelims, so we waited .
until finals to do the job,” he said.

Pitt had six gymnasts qualify for finals and came away with
five first—place finishes, four seconds and two thirds.

Pat Pollaci and Kyle MacBeth were each double winners for
Pitt in the finals. Pollaci won the rings (9.05) and parallel bars
(8.85), while MacBeth took the vault (8.8) and the high bar (8.7).

On the pommel horse, the only event that Pitt did not win in
the finals, MacBeth and Pollaci finished in second and third
place, respectively. David Williams of William and Mary
captured the event with a 9.05.

In the all—around competition, William and Mary’s Dan
Krovich scored 51.75, edging past Pollaci for first place by less
than a point.

“He [Pollaci] had some trouble in the vault which lowered his
score,” Sanchez said.

What they don’t say is that he
was credited with a base hit
every time he received a base on
balls. They also forget about the
fielder wearing a glove the size
of his hand or the current role of
the relief pitcher who is just fresh
as a starter.

What I am trying to say is that

you can take any one of these
“dream” match-ups and make a
case for either side. Since they’ll
never really happen, why do we
give so much time to speculation?

Each time period in sports is
going to have its dominant teams
and individuals. Since they’ll never
really get to match up with those
of other periods, it really should

not be the cause of arguments
and sleepless nights.

We should just admire those
who rise above others and not
be concerned with how they
compare to those with similar

‘achievements. While it is fun to

compare, it should not be a topic
of heated discussion consuming
much of the media’s time.

Continued from page 10

Bob Foley with just under two
minutes gone in the half seemed
to give Pitt some more life, at
least temporarily. Shingler and
Hurt each hit a pair of free
throws and Turia Ransom made a
layup" to pull Pitt to 62-54.

But, Mangum took charge at
that point, scoring nine of her
teams next 16 points to give
Providence an unsurmountable
lead. PC’s biggest lead of the half

came with 11:51 left, 81-61.

Pitt evenutally came back to
outscore Providence 29-20 the
rest of the way to salvage some
measure of respectablility.

“I thought we did play pretty
hard the lastsix or seven minutes,”
Bruce said. “That’s all we ever
ask of these girls.

    

 

All five Pitt starters reached
double figures. Ransom led the

-way with 21 ponts, followed by

Shingler (20), Hurt (15),
McElhinny(13), and‘
McConnell(15).

NOTES: Shingler became the
sixth Pitt women’s player in
history to score over 1000 points

in her career when she made a
free-throw with 1:18 left in the
first half. Even though she never
scored that many points at Altoona
High School, the senior guard
downplayed the achievement
after the game.

“It would have been a lot
nicer if it had come in a game we
had won,” she said.
