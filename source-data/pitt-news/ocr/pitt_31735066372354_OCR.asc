Mondale: NATO
Isundermined  

BY SCOT STONE

Former vice—president Walter
Mondale leveled his sights on Rea-
gan administration foreign policy

Mondayjnight, when he charged‘
that the republicans were actively

undermining the NATO alliance.

Mondale told an audience at Oak-
land's Soldiers and Sailor’s Memor-
ial that NATO was coming under
increasing pressures which are
“being applied to undermine. the
effect'ivenes‘s of that alliance."

ln the past I5 years, according to
Mondale, there has been an
unprecedented Soviet military
build-up, particularly along the
European borders. He cited Soviet
development of the SS-21, mobile

imissile and the Backfire bomber as

evidence of a growing, modern
threat from the east.

Mondale also cited the growth of
an interdependent global economy
that has made competitors out of
formerly close allies, This situation,
particularly. in regard to energy

resources. has expanded western

defense problems by adding the Per-
sian Gulfarea ti) our sphere of“legit-
imate interest.“

Mondale claimed that because
America is “not just another
member of NATO,” but rather its
traditional leader, it is up to the U.S.
to take an active role in dealing with
these problems. ’ ‘

So far, according to Mondale, the
Reagan administration has only suc-

so, where is he headed?

The former vice president’s
appearance Monday night at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall was considered by the
media to be an im'port-ant early
step for Mondale in the race for
the Democratic Party’s I984 pre-

‘ - sidential nomination. -

While Mondale himself has
not gone on record one way or

indications that he has strong
intentions of launching a cam-
paign. There are also a number
of signs to suggest that Mondale
may be a stronger candidate than
Edward Kennedy.
Part of the puzzle can be,

solved by simply considering
what other jobs Mondale, an

‘ extremelyactive party member,

might t be considering. iAs a
former senator, and former vice
president, he can have only one
further aim: at the presidency.

dale has been up to in the months
following his departure from the
White House. He has been very
busy doing what any potential
candidate should be expected to
do—working the lecture circuit.
Before his appearance at Pitt,
Mondale spoke before the World
Affairs Council in New York. He
has delivered commencement
addresses, talked to labor, '
groups, and,as he mentioned in
his speech last Monday, spent
nearly a month in Europe this
year assessing the situation.

ForbesQuad May Be   

Shopping Area Site

By SETH LU BOVE

” If, at sometime‘ in the near
future, you happen to step out of
your Forbes Quadrangle political
science lecture and into the center of
a collection of shops and boutiques,
try not to be alarmed. x *

F You just might find something
you like. C

At least that's what Pitt is hoping
as architects draw up preliminary
plans to build a set ofenclosed shops

”in the open courtyard between

Forbes Quad and Hillman Library.
“We're thinking of little artistic
shopsiand amenities that_we could
rent out and use to better. serve the
students,‘ and make it an exciting
environment,” Pitt Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar said recently. He has in
mind a small-scaleiversion of the
Station Square shops in downtown
Pittsburgh. ‘
Jack Freeman, Pitt’s senior vice
chancellor of administration,

.explained that the idea of putting A

some commercial establishments
near Forbes Quad was discussed

‘ among university officials a few.

years ago as an extension of the
Schenley Hall renovation project.

While it would be part ofthat gen-
eral development, the Forbes Quad
proposal would be a separate
project.

Freeman caufioned, however,
that the project is still in the prelimi-
nary stages. _

“We've been looking at it from a
financial point of view mostly: is it
feasible? is there a market. for it?
And we really”haven’t,;answered that

\

said,

question," he said. .
“We have some sort ofconceptual

drawings on how you might go s

about doing it. But that is so uncer-
tain at this point that l would really
prefer not to even discuss it because
it’s highly_ problematic that it will
ever come to fruition,” Freeman
said. .
Freeman said the university, ifjt

i went ahead with the project, would

build an “all-weather” facility,
covered with clear Plexiglas or glass. ‘

But don’t expect to be greeted by F

another 7-ll or a McDonald’s as
you leave your-“Global Economic
Relations" class.
“I think one 7-Ii on a block is
enough." Posvarjoked. _ ,
“But I predict something like it
will occur in the next few years,”\he,

continued. ,There’s a nationwide

trend and a great demand for this
kind of thing. And across the coun-
try, old spaces, quadrangles and
buildings are being renovated and

used for cultural and commercial ’

amenities. _
“What we’re talkingtabout IS

improving the quality oflife for stu- .

dents, and doing soat no net cost to

theiuniversity," Posvar said.
Freeman, however, is taking a

more pessimistic view of the

* proposal. ‘ .v

“The only way it could be made
viable 'is if it paid for itself. And
whether itgwill or not is very shaky in
my judgement at this time. lt would
be very costly and it cannot be

pursued unless it can generate the F

revenues necessary to pay for it,” he

lFratiHousi_n
  Fightcontinues

By SETH LUBOVE
lf Mother Goose were to give title
“to it, the current opposition to build-
ing a fraternity housing complex off
of University Driveshould be called
“The Fraternities That Nobody
Wanted."
Or, to give it an appropriate intel-
Alectual description, it’s a case of uni-
versity construction versus

neighborhood concerns. 

On one side of the conflict is Pitt
4‘ and I0 fraternities that‘r‘are going

ahead with plans to construct a fra- ,

ternity housing complex, in part to
case some of the neighborhood ten-
sions generated by the fraternities‘
present location. i

in the opposite corner are the
present residents of the proposed
construction site, Brackenridge and
Avalon streets, who are quite con-
tent with the way things are.

Jack Freeman, Pitt's senior vice
chancellor for administration, while
not going so far as to claim victory in
the conflict, recognizes’ the neigh-
borhood’s concern. ,

“Whether we can ever convince
the people that they will be better off
with the fraternities up there than
they are without the fraternities, l
think that’s asking too much. M

“But l think it’s probably expect-
ing "too much not to expect the
neighborhood to be concerned
and worry about those

things."

“At ithe same time," Freeman
said,“it is after all, our property and
(the proposed fraternity complex) is
fully consistent with the uses for
which that property has been held
and acquired over the years. This is a

A university after all, and it's tough to
have a university without having
students.”

Residents’ concerns center on the

/parking and noise which they feel

would be generated by the introduc-

tion of fraternities so close to their

neighborhood. _
“People up. here are concerned

about courtesy to the neighbors and
parking on out streets," said Ron

Coleman of the Brackenridge Street .

Citizens‘ Group.

Coleman said his group will try to
stop the project by examining its
affects on emergency vehicle access
and their childrens’ safety, and then
presenting those findings to the city.

“We‘re‘going to do our darnest if
we can to try to stop them from
building it,” Coleman said;

All said, the neighborhood
groups position on the matter
doesn‘t leave Pitt many options in
the design ofthe complex, consider-
ing the neighbors don‘t want it there

‘in the first place.

But just as committed as it is to

building the complex, Pitt is also ‘

committed to ensuring that the
neighborhood’s concerns are inte-
grated into the architectural plans,
Freeman said.
, ‘jWe’re stil_l working on a solution
to the parking problem. We don’t
have that nailed down yet, but we’re
working on it,” he said.

“We’re particularly determined to
design an attractive facility that

would be in keeping with the neigh— ‘

borhood, and design it in such a way
that most of the student traffic and
noise would be directed away from
the community and toward the uni-

. versity.” "'

The university is considering two
possible options to accomodate

parking, Freeman said: examining
‘the existing university-owned park-

ing areas near the complex and see-
ing if those could accomodate the
fraternity cars; andnegotiating with
the Veterans Hospital, which would

be across the street from the com--

plex, to see if the university could
share some of those parking spaces.
Tentative plans, designed by the
Pittsburghlarchitectural firm of Liff.
Chetlin & Associates, would have
between three and four groups of
townhouses containing two or three
individual houses a piece.

Advising Center Will Be
Fully Staffed Next Term

By MARY KANE

No one’s quite sure how it will be
paid for yet, but the College ofArts
and Sciences advising center plans
to be fully staffed for the winter
term.

College of Arts and Sciences
Dean Irwin Schulman said the cen-

' ter will come up with enough funds

“one way or another" to have a full
staff next term.

An increase in freshman en-
rollment and budget cuts within the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences forced
the center to cut three advising posi-
tions for the fall term, which creates
a 300-student overload.

Earlier this -year, a plan was sug-
gested by.S‘chuIman and approved
by Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
Senior Vice Chancellor for Admin-
istration’ Jack Freeman. The plan
called for the professional schools
served by the center to pay for the
additional advising positions.

Schulman said yesterday that this
plan is not likely to be implemented
because the professional schools are
also short on funds. He added, how-
ever, that the center has been work-
ing on alternative ways to come up
with the funds for next term.

“We’re trying to get the staffing
back to where we were last‘ year,“

‘Schulman said. “We‘lI have to patch
together something for next term."

He said that to receive the neces-
sary funding. the center will have_.,to
demonstrate thatxincreasing enroll-
ment is placing increasing demands
on them.

Advising center Assistant Direc-
tor David Luedde said the center is
investigating the possibility of advi-
sors receiving work-study funding.

Undergrad Work Published

By JONI DENNIS

Pitt students have taken the initia— x

tive to create the Pittsburgh Under-
graduate Review, “the first
undergraduate scholarly-refereed
journal in the U.S.,” according to
Honors Program Director, Profes-
sor Alec Stewart.

The 'Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review is published semi-annually,
and contains essays written mainly
by talented and motivated under-
graduate Pitt students.

The Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review is staffed by Pitt students. In
addition, 65 faculty members serve
as referees-~ they evaluate each

author's paper on its depth of -
research, quality of analysis and
clarity of presentation, according to
Ro_bert Pape, general editor.

“Getting 65 faculty members par-
ticipating by serving as referees is
pretty impressive.” said ‘Stewart.
“Thisjournal shows undergraduate
and professor scholarly initiative.”

The Review also contains articles
written by authors outside of Pitt.
Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel Prize 1
winner. contributed an essay
entitled “What Kind of a Place is a
University?"

“Most of the good work written
by students used to end up sitting on
shelves before the Pittsburgh Under-

graduate Review was started,” said
Ron Barber. associate managing
editor. “Now everyone gets the
chance to read it.”

Pape developed the Pittsburgh
Undergraduate Review last year
after getting the idea while studying
abroad in Vienna and talking to stu-
dents from other schools, according
to Stewart: .

Papers may be submittediat any
time throughout the year, and any
student interested in having a paper
published in the journal is encour-
aged to submit his work -for consid-
eration, according to Scott Seltz.
senior managing editor.

A Mondale Criticizes

cecded in making matters worse. “In
my. opinion, the current administra-
tion is not meeting that test," Mon-
dale said.

He added that Reagan‘s policy of
“strident rhetoric" and talk of
limited nuclear war is making the
Europeans doubtful of America’s
ability to act as a partner in the
alliance.

Mondale said that the recent wave
of anti—nuclear protests in Europe
are aniindication ofthe high level of
anxiety on the continent. He
claimed that the American response

‘has played into the hands of the

Soviets by “surrendering the moral
high ground.”

Mondale believes that the U.S.
should be actively engaging the Rus-
sians in arms control talks, while at
the same time giving the image of
unity and strength among the allies.

He cited five points of action that
are necessary ifthe NATO alliance is
to survive as a viable “deterrent" to
Soviet aggression.

First, there has to be a “steadiness
and purposiveness in joint policy.”

“There cannot be a continuous
quadrennial lurch in U.S. foreign
policy,” Mondale said. “The present
administrations got-it—alone policy
towards the Soviets in economics.
arms control and the third world,
are undermining the alliance.”

Second, Mondale said that we
must agree with NATO on the exact
nature of the Soviet threat, and
move “in an orderly approach” to
meet it. He gave, as an example, the
I979 NATO agreement to increase
allied defense expenditures by three
percent over inflation, and the devel-
opment of modern “theater” tactical
weapons.

Third, Mondale made the point
that it is imperative for both the U.S.
and its allies to work out a balanced
policy of containment of Soviet
power,“ along with simultaneous
moves to ease the pressure ofmutual
defense build~ups.

Mondale said that “the air has
been poisoned by charges of neutral"-
ism from one side, and cold warism”
from the Europeans. This clash,
according to Mondale, “confuses
and undermines the allies.”

instead of seizing the initiative on
this issue, Mondale said that the cur—
rent U.S. administration, appears
more like a “reluctant bride.” M

Fourth, Mondale talked about
the need to coordinate American

associated with newcomer
Jimmy Carter, isjust such a man.
Mondale has been a force in the
National Democratic party since
i960 when he became Minneso-
ta’s state attorney general.

At a time when many activists
at the grass roots level believe
that for the Democratic Party to
prosper it must become more
radical, a growing number of
analysts are suggesting the possi-
bility that success mightjust lie in
a more conservative, more tradi~
tionally organized party struc-
ture. lf the analysts are right,
Walter Mondale could be the
next‘ president of the United
States.

and European economic policies
towards the third world.

The current “tight—money"
approach to dealing with inflation.
according to Mondale, has put enor~
mous pressure on the Europeans by
forcing them to adopt similar poli-
cies in order to keep their money at
home.

.Finally, Mondale said that the
allies need to coordinate their poli~
cies of foreign relations. .

Mondale concluded that the Uni-
ted States is moving away from the
original policies on which the
NATO alliance was built. He said
that the U.S. has always offered a
more attractive system to other
nations of the world, but that the
Reagan administrations approach
to foreign policy, particularly with
respect to the third world nations,
has worked .to alienate many
countries.

ln a question and answer period.
Mondale was critical ofa number of
aspects of Reagan administration
policy, including the proposed sale
of AWACS planes to the Saudis,

and the appeal for some of the

Moral Majority.

Mondale’s speech was delayed
twenty minutes when, according to
Pittsburgh Police, an anonymous
caller phoned in a bomb threat. A
search of the premises failed to turn
up the bomb, and Mondale began
his speech.

With that observation Mexican

other world leaders together with

Clearly the goal of the Cancun

In this respect there can be no

A bonus benefit.

Additionally..it is hoped that the
' success of this summit meeting will
be repeated during the Mexico

Workshop to be held at the Univer—

sity of Pittsburgh on November 5

Much of the material covered at
the workshop will be similar in con~
tent to that discussed by the world
leaders here at Cancun.

As summed up by
Lopez. Portillo, “I can assert that if
the problem belongs to us all. we are
also, all of us together, the solution.”

And in this corner...

It’s the fraternities vs. the residents, an
already familiar battle that is heating up even
before the troops take to the field.

Pitt and 10 of its fraternities are going
ahead with plans to construct a fraternity
housing complex in the area of Brackenridge
and Avalon streets. f V ‘

But residents of those areas are ‘going
ahead with plans to fight Pitt’s moves.

“We’re going to do our darndest if we can
to try to stop them from building it,” Ron
Coleman ‘of the Brackenridge Street Citizen
Group said. I _

Colemanfs group could serve as a geogra-
phical replacement for Oakland Directions
Inc. (ODI), which previously complained
about the fraternities. Now, since the frater-
nities are moving from ODI’s area, The
Brackenridge Street Citizens’ Group seems
ready to pick up the slack. I _ I

The Brackenridge group’s concerns center
on parking problems that they believe their
new neighbors will cause. In light of the
somewhat substantial claims of ODI (keep in
mind .that"ODI complained about having to
live right next door to fraternities, not several
parking lots away). It appears that the Brack-
enridge group’s actions are rather premature
and trivial. , *

Senior p
ministration Jack Freeman has repeatedly
said that the university is taking special pre-
cautions to try to avoid creating problems for
the surrounding area. Freeman, being realis-
tic, said he doesn’t think, the neighbors will

welcome the Greeks with open arms. But he is l

quick to add that Pitt is not ignoring the

-residentsconcerns. ‘ ' I 
Whether Pitt will actually take these pre-

cautions remains to be seen—which is exactly

» why the Brackenridge group’s concerns are

hardly valid at this point. It’s senselessﬂfor the
group to build a case against the fraternity

complex when no one is quite sure at this _

point what problems, if any, the complex will

. create. . A _
In short, the Brackenridge group is creat-

inga problem before even giving it a chance
to exist. We hopethat the disruption caused
by the building and subsequent occupancy of
the fraternity complex will be minimal and
bearable. But we think that until the fraterni-
ties prove themselves otherwise, the local«res—
idents should not yet begin’ to fight.

A There are at least two ways to view
thejoggers, pedestrians andicommu-

ters who pepper crowded city streets
V wearing stereo headphones attached

to mini—tape player/tuners."

The first view, of course, is that
they wear these small devices_to
combat the carriers of 30- and 40-
pound “monster box" radios and
cassette recorders that add to the
already -unbearable levels of noise‘
pollution. Headphone wearers,
according to the first view, are mak-
ing the statement that “I am listening
to the musical orleducatibnal pro-
gram of my choice without intruding
on my fellow citizens’ space."

headphone wearers are ‘saying
approximately the following: “I've
got mine, and you yearn to get
yours, buddy.”This latter sentiment

feel. I ,

In a pluralistic society, where free-
dom of choiceis often tied to‘such
‘things as status and illusions ofindi-
viduality, it irks me to see common
folkshut out so much of the world
around them. iMind you, I am not
contending that sharing, over a
loudspeaker, a Ted Nugent opus

‘called “Cat Scratch Fever" will bring

* this country any closer togetherthan

would Aaron Copland’s “Fanfare
for the Common Man”as played by
the New York Philharmonic.
Whatl am concernediabout is the
rise in the number of people wearing
these headsets who are indeed tun-
ing out the world around them. One
can argue that radio does have news
and ‘information. though I think it
‘unlikely that news and information
are what these people are really
after. Rather, they-want temporary
escapism. a meditation of'sorts. Yet
reality, or the fantastic world of
tragedy, human suffering and tri-
umph that we call reality. is at once
too terrible. too beautiful and too
vital to be ignored.
Why listen to Wagner while rak-
ing the leaves or shoveling snow?
Take offthe headphones, and do the
same chores. You’ll get the same
feelings of strength, power, energy.

-Safettiy: It’s Up To Us

Dear Editor: “ \

I would like to respond to the
question posed in Oct. 26’s Pitt
\News—“Who’s responsible for the
safety of Pitt students?”

On Sunday, Oct. II, I drove to
Oakland early in the evening. The
only parking spot available was in

the back of Hillman parking lot. I ~

‘studied at a friend's in Bruce Hall
until I230 a.m. I had heard about the

rape that occurred on Forbes Ave. -.

Considering the late 'hour’ and
deserted Sunday streets. I did not
intend to walk back to my car alone.

My friend and her roommates were"

asleep, so I walked through theTow-
ers lobby and down to the Original.
There are always a few policemen
out in front, and I assumed I could
get an escort to my car. .

I approached a Pittsburgh city.

police officer who was calmly walk-
ing into the Original.
He laughed’ and said, “Sorry,

-\
,/.

honey, you’re going to have to go
and findrone of the campus police."

I said, “But there was a girl raped
right down the street last week...” He
ignored me, however, and went
inside to get something to eat. (At
the time, I was more worried about
getting to my car safely than getting
his. name and badge number.)

I waited I0 minutes, but there

were no campus police to be seen.

Shortly after, two students on their
way to the dorms offered to take me
to my car.

According to statements [read in

The Pitt News, the rape on Oct. 3,5)’ i

didn't occur in the residence halls soil
it is not theruniversity’s “responsibil-
ity." The students safety doesn’t
seem to be the city police’s responsi-
bility either. I suppose it is left up to
us to take care of each other.

Dear Editor:

Beside the fact that my picture
was smaller than Walter’Mondale’sI
I have only one complaint to make
about the profile of me that ran in
your issue of 26 Oct.

The survey of undergraduate stu-

dents that revealed their perceptions
of untoward teaching behaviors on
the parts of some oftheir instructors
was not a survey by my office (the
Office of Faculty Development), as
reported. It was done by a subgroup
of the Provost‘s Committee on Re--
tention. as part ofan attempt to see
whether inadequate student—faculty
relationships might have a bearing
on students’ dropping out of school.

The survey, moreover. did not claim ’

-to be a scientific one, but only a
rough indicator of the presence of

such teaching behaviors. on ‘the r

campus. V
s.

The Office of Faculty Develop-
ment does not monitor teaching
behavior. via surveys or in any other
way, nor does it impose and ad-
ministrative regulation whatsoever
on the faculty. We are purely a ser-
vice to our faculty colleagues. pro-;
viding confidential help and
encouragement with teaching when-
ever a faculty member voluntarily
requests it. Experience has shown
that offering teaching-improvement
services in this collegial, non-
pressuring manner is the most
successful way to improve teaching
in a university setting. It has been
most gratifying to observe the great
increase in attention to teaching

.4

quality across the campus that has“)

taken place in the past few years. ,i

"  Sue lived at home during her first
term as a freshman. Now a sopho-
more-, she lives on campus and looks
back on last year as “boring and not
really belonging.” - ,

She doesn’t miss her former daily
car«to-class-to-car habit, nor hunt-
ing fora parking space,

M e “I had a feeling of still being in
  high school,” Sue explains. “I

arranged my classes as close as l ‘

 ‘could so I could come to school and
, go straight home in the shortest
i amount of time.” .
This feeling of not belonging is
not unique to Sue or to other com-
muters at Pitt, but common among
» thousands of commuters at colleges
all across the country, i _ ,
V “More and more we are finding
a P that commuters want a voice in cam-
pus matters,” says Penny Rue, a
. coordinator for~the National Clear-
‘ ‘inghouse for Commuter*Programs
 -”‘(N'CCiP) located at the University of
‘Maryland. “We serve as the advo-
cates of thisgoal and an information

2 bank on the commuting affairs of

the 225 universities and colleges that
“belong to our organization.” ‘

Of the [896] full-time and part-
‘time Pitt undergraduates, l4,7*6l are
commuters. V 4
 "l:_hese commuters comprise a

C‘ diverse, group that consists of

 Greeks, Armed Forces_veterans,
» o.lder"adults returning to school,-

first-term freshmen and everything
in between. . , A
“Basically, there are three broad
4"-areas that commuters fall into,” says
Rue. “The student who commutes,
from home, the independent student
who lives off campusand the return-
ing adult." V’ \
However, Rue does not believe
commuter classification should stop
at such a generalilevel.

“Each university needs to do

* demographic research to find out

exactly how diverse their commun-
ter group (is),” explains Rue. “By _

finding out who their population is, ,

only then can they can learn if
they're serving their needs."

Rue uses the example of an activ-
ity fee, saying that all students pay it,
but it’s questionable whether such
traditional activities as homecoming »

and floor mixers meet the needs of ‘

the older commuters.

Basically, there are three

broad areas t'hat«c0mmu—
tersi fall into: the student
who commutesfrom home.
the independent student

who lives off campus and

-the returning adult.

Pitt Director of Student Activities
Andy Smith says that commuters
are not singled out as a group when
planning activities, but rather since
“87 percent of Pitt's student body‘
commutes, almost everything
planned pertains to them one way or
another”. .

“it is very difficult to single out
commuters as an individual group
because it is too diverse,” says
Smith. “The only thing many have in
common is that they don't .live ‘on
campus.”

Roth photo A ;

This type of thinking is similar to
what Rue refers to as a traditional
excuse used by universities who are
unable or unwilling to find out
about their subpopulation.

Neither the lnstitutional and Pol-
icy Studies or Commuter Affairs
Committee at Pitt has statistics on

the number of students who com-
mute from home ‘or. from
apartments. “

Butregardless of where a student
‘commutes from, there are common
problems for commuters.

The most common complaint
among commuters is~the,planning of
activities during the night.

“Theyshould plan more daytime
activities,” says a commuter from
Penn Hills, “I miss the daytime
movies they had last year."

“its too much to go home and
then come back'at.night'when’you
have to commute a half—hour each
way,” adds another commuter.

According to Smith, planning
major activites during the day is det-
rimental to theieducational purpose
of the university. ‘ . ‘

“By planning a lecturer during the A

day, say Walter Mondale for exam-
ple, we may be forcing students to
make a choice between their class or
the lecture,” says Smith. “The uni-
versity does not believe in enda nger-'
ing a student’s education.” A

Another problem a number of
communting , students complained
about is the university’s lack ofcom-‘
munication with students.

“I don't think the university com-
municates well with its students,"
says a former commuter. “There are .
a‘ lot of programs and events that are
never advertised or ‘stressed, and if
they are it’s only to certain focus
groups.” ’

Smith says theuniversity is doing
“a reasonably good job” of deliver
ing information to the entire stpdent
body, but heiadmits that there is a

. need for improvement.

“We recognized this. need two

_years ago with our incoming fresh-

man class when we mailed material
and held an activities fair to provide
information‘ on the l5O student
organi7.at’i_ons and services,” he says.
“There must be a great access of
information if commuters are going
to feel comfortable.” ,
Smith explains that communica-
tion is hindered by two problems~-
gathering the information and
delivering this information. i I
“The university in the foreseeable
future will move toward a sophisti-
cated computer system for the deliv-
ery of information,” Smith says.

-“We are talking about ‘expensive.

sophisticated equipment. This is not
a ‘snap the finger’ , type of
operation."

There is often a stigma attached to‘
students who commute from home
that classifies , these students as
afraid to leave their parents, as hav-

“ing no social life, and as being

slightly immature.

“This idea ‘of commuters“ being
afraid to cut mother's apron strings
is slowly fading,“ says Rue. “The
reason, students co,mr_nute from

   

/

home vary. Maybe there aren’t

‘enough rooms on campus, or the

student can’t afford to live on his
own. i

91

“l’ve_ been going straight home
from here for the past three years,“
says another commuter who feels he
hasn’t missed anything by living at

“I would prefer to live on campus, home. “I leave the university here;
but l can‘t afford to,” says John, a , I’d rather not have it carry over dur-

first—term freshman who verifies.

Rue’s statement. “Besides, l have a.
part—time job near my home.”

“l chose to live at home, and ifl
had to do it all again, I wouldn’t
change a thing,”says Sue, a five-year
Pitt commuter. *

ing the rest of my’ day.” Another
commuter, feelingjust the opposite,
disagrees.

“I started college outby going
straight home from school," says
Linda, a Squirrel Hill commuter
who is active in various campus acti-

 

 

     

   

 

vites. “But I soon realized something
was missing. If you don't become
involved, you miss out on the total
college learning experience."

Linda adds further that she sees a
trend of more commuters becoming
involved in student organizations,
but adds there are still commuters
who are unaware and complain of
not feeling a part of the university.

“Students who complain about
not feeling a part of it are closing
their eyes,” says Smith. “There is a

 

 

     

 _ ,

 

virtual smorgasbord of activities to
choose from.“ '

Smith says that all students,
regardless of where they live, get out
of college what they put into it and
“that the concept ‘What is the uni-
versity doing for commuters’ is the
wrong idea to begin with.”

According to Rue, the most
important things a university can do
in giving a commuter a sense of
belonging are making transporta-

yiused. Rue bgelieves that it is impor-

   

tion as smooth as possible and pro-
viding a place to pass the time.

While Pitt may be a somewhat -

weak on the first part with its park-
ing problems, Pitt will probably pass
the second part with flying colors
when the renovation of the Student
Unioneis completed in another two
.years. ' *

“It will become a place to be,” says
Smith. “it should appeal especially
to commuters, who want a_n.alterna-
tive to the library and the cathedral
between classes.” * ‘

Plans call for a larger, more
attractive recreation area and an
enlarged television area. The entire
Basement will be opened up com-
plete with a dining area, restaurant,
atrium and a small sundry store.

 

On the first floor, there will be a-

loungeiarea for studying and
snoozing—something a number of

commuters say they miss. K ~

The Commuter Affairs Commit-
tee (CAC). a 3i-member standing-
committee of the Student Govern-
ment Board, has taken great steps in

hopes of alleviating Pitt’s parking ‘

shortage with its commuter car pro-
gram known as COMCAP-K”

“Commuters will receive a list of
all the other students in their area
interested in forming a carpool,"
‘explains CAC Chairman Linda
Hausman. “The success of the pro-
grams depends on student
participation.”

Hausman says the CAC is a
service-oriented group whose pur-
pose is, to promote commuters in
campus -- activities. CAC projects
include publishing the commuter
newspaper Magic Bus, sponsoring a
free parking day once a term and
providing funds for the Commuter
Bandit, a mysterious creature who
resembles a character from Ronald
McDonald Land and rescues cars
with expired meters from the meter
maid. A

The CAC also plans to conduct a
survey of all-student organizations

"to find out the extent of commuter
participation. C

“We’re interested in seeing how
strong commuter participation is
and what CAC and the Office of
Student Activities can do to enhance
it,” explains Hausman.

At other colleges and universities,
groups similar to CAC have the
same goal in mind - to provide com-
muters with organization-and are
going about it in various ways.

To help bridge a communication
gap, the commuter center at Boston
University is experimenting with a
direct—mail newsletter called The
Commuter Line.

At the University of California at
Irvine, the student commuter office
tries to encourage student involve-
ment by organizing trips to ski
resorts and to l.aker game.

Meanwhile, the University of
Maryland tudent organization is
taking a slightly different approach
by sponsoring a happy hour twice a
month complete with [music and
beer.

Boston College BetterThan It

a

6.,

The Pitt News, Wednesday, October 28. 198/

By AMIN GHOSSEIN AND

JOHNETTE HOWARD

It's a mystery to almost everyone
including Boston College football
Coach Jack Bicknell, as to why his
Eagles are mired ii; the depths of
frustration with a 2-4 record.

After all,this isthe same teamthat
returned 39 lettermen from a 7-4 sea-
son last year. This is the same team
that crushed Stanford last year and
opened up with an impressive one-
point victory at Texas A&M this
year.

So why 2-4? »

“lt‘s one of those things as a coach

i you don’t have any answers for, so

you just try to forget it,” Bicknell
said yesterday. .

After pondering a bit more, Bick-
nell admitted that injuries have been
partially responsible for the ‘nose
dive-his team took before regroup-
ing last week to whip Army 4l-6.

“We were healthy against A&M.
We’ve lost three guys for good, and
when we knew they were out for the
year, we wilted a little bit. We’re
frustrated.”

Out for the season are defensive

end Russ Joyner and probably‘?

defensive back Tony Thurman. Also

injured and questionable for the Pitt

game are quarterback Dennis Scala_,.
who started the season for’ BC. and

the Eagles‘ top-ﬂight running back,

Shelby Gamble. Gamble suffered a

hip pointer in last week’s win and

will not start practicing again until

today.

Gamble’s absence would prompt
no regrets in Pitt——two years ago, as
a freshman, the 5-H, I97-pound
Gamble sca-mpered for 146 yards
against the Panthers. Last week,

junior Howie Brown stepped in

adeptly for the injured Gamble to
romp for H4 against Army.

On the bright side for BC. defen-
sive end Junior Poles returns from a
head injury that forced him to miss
one game. Poles, a mammoth 6-5,
278-pounder, gave Pitt fits in last
year’s narrow I4-6 opening game
win by burning past Pitt offensive
tackle Jimbo Covert for four sacks.

It was Covert’s first start ever at
the position. and things could be a
lot different this year when he lines
up against Poles.

‘‘It’s gonna be a good match-up

between those two," said Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill. “Defensively, they
gave us a lot of trouble last year."
But’ injuries are only one of Bick-
nell’s headaches. Against Pitt’s.No.
l-ranked defense, Bicknell will
counter with a freshman quarter-
back who can barely see over the
backs of his linemen when they line

up for the snap, let alone downfield. .

He's Doug Fluttie, who, though
listed at 5-IO, l72—pounds, is closer
to 5-9, “if he’s lucky”, according to
Bicknell. Despite his lack of height,
Fluttie has performed surprisingly
well for Bicknell, who inserted the
freshmen into the lineup late in the
Penn State game, “just to see what
he could do.” .

‘‘We’ve been happy with the way
he's playing. He throws the ball well
with good velocity and. good touch,"
Bicknell said.

Fluttie is the fourth ‘quarterback

Bicknell has tried this season.
They may sound ‘like the Bad
News Bears of college football. but
after last week’s hard-fought win
over lowly-regarded Syracuse, Sher-

. rill repeats he’s taking no opponent’

lightly.

‘By LISA GRENEVICKI

When the last home soccer game
of the I981 season takes place at Pitt
Stadium tonight,iit will mark the last
game in front of the home fans for
three Pitt players: seniors Scott
Thunberg, Al Adelmann, and Jim

u‘Hackworth.

The three, who will be honored
before tonight’s game, have contrib-

‘ uted to 26 Panther victories since

 

coming to Pitt. They've also played a
large part in the Pitt booters rise
from a 6-8 record in 1978 to this
year's 8-4 season and shot at the
West Penn Conference title.

Scott Thunberg, a standout goalie
in his four years here, has chalked up
ll shutouts in his career. He has an
outside shot at the Pitt all-time
record of l4 shutouts in the Panth-
er‘s three remaining games.

Thunberg has recorded 252
saves——S3 this season—-and has only
allowed l4 goals in I2 games this
year.

“Thunberg came to Pitt with a
minimal amount of background in a
difficult position,” said Pitt coach
Leo Bemis. “He’s had a lot of co -
petition and he's had to share the
goal with other players. He has

steadily improved through’ the .

years." L

The Pitt soccer team will take its
8-4 record and West Penn Confer-
ence title hopes into their lasthome
game of the season when they play
host to West Virginia Wesleyan
tonight at Pitt Stadium.

Wesleyan. ranked sixth nationally
in Division II and sporting a 9-3-l
record, will bring a strong team with
foreign’ tint to the Panther turf.

Wesleyan beat the Pitt booters
last year in an exhibition game 2-l.
Both of Wesleyan’s goals were
scored by Matt Engl‘e, their leading
scorerfor two years. who has since
transferred to Pitt but has to Slt.OUI a

' year under NCAA rules.

This year. the Wesleyan team is
led by David Turner, from England,
and Richie Stevenson and Chris
Dehring, both from Jamaica, who
all have six— goals on the year.

Wes‘leyan’s biggest scoring threat
is Stuart Tahomasos from Toronto,
Canada.

. _“He is small but quick and will hit
anything that‘s near the goal," said
Pitt'Coach Leo Bemis.

NFL rookie Hugh Green hasa
million-dollar contract to play a
game he says he loves, a spra-
wling house in Tampa. Fla, with

"Yankee owner George Stien-
brenner as a neighbor. and a
Corvette and a three-car garage
to park it in.

Yet when Ann Sunseri picked
up the telephone Monday morn-
ing. she found Hugh Green talk-
ing on the other end of the line
from a phone booth in Monro-
eville. “Come get me. Hurry up.
I'm home."

* * *

“He captured the imagination
ofthis town. People became very
close to him.“ one of Green‘s
friends said last night. “He went
from a poor home to being some-
body spectacular. He still gets
lonely for Pittsburgh now. He’s
homesick. These were the best
years of his life.“

Hugh Green has been called
the best defensive player in ‘the
history of college football. Dur-
ing his stellar career at Pitt. he
was a four-year All-America.
Maxwell trophy winner. and
Heisman‘ Trophy runner-up.

ln his first year in the NFL.
Green is a man starting over

them are found on a football
field.

 “I asked him what he missed

again. in many ways. Not all of

 

the most and he said, ‘I miss ever-

an

ything. You name it, I miss it.
Mrs. Sunseri. mother ofPitt line-
backer Sal Sunseri who is a close

‘friend of Green’s. “He was so

glad to be back. He was all smiles
when I picked him up.

“He said he misses Mineo’s
pina. he misses Primanti’s. He
misses the pepperoni and
scrambled eggs l used to make
him. He misses his friends and he

says he misses Pitt," Mrs. Sun-

seri said. " He misses the whole
atmosphere here.

“Hugh Green willrbe allright.”
said Mrs. Sunseri. “lt’s.been an
adjustment. You can get a little
melancholy, y'know‘.’ He’s
lonely. He’ll be all right."

* * *

While his Tampa Bay Bucca-
neer teammates flew back to
Florida after Sunday's game in
Philadelphia. Green got some
time offto visit Pittsburgh Mon-

day and yesterday. He said the‘

visit went too fast.

“Its good to be back in Pitts-
burgh. I wanted to see some peo-
ple I haven‘t seen in a long
time...and let Coach Sherrill
know l’m still thinking about
him." Green said yesterday when
he stepped to the microphone at

Pitt‘s weekly football luncheon.
“I appreciate everything eve-

ryone has given mein my four.

years here—-theuniversity. the
eity.'Coach Sherrill, the media,
everyone who has helped me."
Green continued. “lt’s a whole
different world now. Playing
ball. Paying taxes and paying
bills."

Green smiled slightly whilethe
reporters huddled in the room
erupted with laughter at the last
sentence. “l wish l was back in
school. " he continued. speaking
softer than before.

* * *

After a college career that has
perhaps neverbeen paralleled by
a defensive player. Hugh Green
is starting over again. The Noxl
draft pick knows his plethora of
awards don‘t mean athing any
more.

Neither does the fact he almost
won the Heisman Trophy, finish-
ing a close second-- the highest
finish ever for a defensive
player-—-and losing out to a
friend, running back George
Rogers.

Like his personal life. life in
the NFL has been adjustment,
Green says.

“lt’s different. It's a business
and its ajob. " Green said yester-
day after the press conference.
“You go in at l0. come out at 5.1
still enjoy it or I probably

Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill congratulates Hugh Green during ceremonies last year when Green's No. 9.9 was

wouldn’t do it. But it’s different.“

Though he says the adjust-
ments to linebacker from drop
end at Pitt has posed no serious
problems. learning a new system
and adapting to a higher level of
competition has been a chal-
lenge, Green admits. A late start
after a contract holdout didn’t
help either.

’ “I signed my contract about

Thursday at midnight. The next
day. I thought we‘d be practicing
in shorts and we were in full
gear.“ Green said. “I wasn’t
ready for that. They handed me a
playbook and said learn it."

To catch up. Green says he
met with his coaches three times
a day to speed up his learning of
Tampa’s system. The two-a-day
drills of camp helped him. he
said. as did the coaches.

“I'd make a mistake in the
morning session, but I'd come
back in the afternoon and wipe it
out. They've (the coaches) been
very patient and very helpful to
me." ' '

But he says he’s still learning.
and still has room to improve.
His goals‘? How about perfec-
tion‘? “id like. by the end of the
year. to play a good. good l0
percent game on a scale of IO,"
Green said. “It's been a big
adjustment. its been more a
mental thing for me. I think I can

No progresswas reported in

the formation of the proposed _

all-sports Eastern conference
after officials from seven schools
met Monday in Philadelphia,
hoping to iron out their
differences. M

Representatives from Pitt,
Penn State, Boston College, Syr-
acuse, Temple, West Virginia
and Rutgers met for five hoursto
discuss potent/ilal commissioners.
revenue sharing and other guide-
lines for the formation of the
conference.

One of the stickier issues at the
meeting was revenue sharing. a
topic which Pitt‘s representative
Dean Billick, called a“big area of
concern.”

“There are different opinions
on regulating revenue sharing
and we haven’t resolved any-
thing,“ Billick, Pitt's associate
athletic director for public
affairs. said yesterday. “lt’s not
the only area of concern, but we
haven’t reached a common
ground yet."

While Billick would not spec-
ify the content ofthe discussions
or what was agreed on. he did
say. “We do have some common
ground. We have made certain
agreements in certain areas,
which we are taking back to our
administrators to get approval
on." 9

The meeting was the latest ofa
dozen gatherings that have been
held in the past year. in addition
to numerous conference calls, to
try to pound out an acceptable
league framework.

While some schools. such as
Pitt and Penn State, preferan
all-sports conference, others
such as Syracuse and Boston
College want the conference to
be primarily for football.

them, as they play their final game
on the Pitt Stadium turf.

“I'd like to go out with a win

“I wish there wasn’t a four-year.

without soccer."

“I will still enjoy soccer. l‘ll still be
around and a part ofthe team (next
year) even. though I won’t be a
player. I came to play to have fun
and l have." Thunberg said.

“I'll still be playing in amateur
leagues for the next few months,"
said Adelmann. “I really wish i
could play indoor soccer for Pitt--~
—it’s a highlight of the season~-but
I can’t under the (NCAA) rules.

Easing his adjustment, Green

said, has been Tampa Head

Coach John McKay. “He’s had a
lot of confidence in me,” Green
said. “He takes a lot ofcriticism,
but he puts you out there, lets
you play and says ‘Grow up’.

“l’m looking forward to get-
ting one year under my belt, liv-
ing in Tampa for a year and
getting things more relaxed than
they are right now,“ Green said.
“We just have to get our offense
clicking and stop beating
ourselves." -

Does being a No.l draft choice
with a high-priced contract and
shimmering string of collegiate
credentials make him. feel any
pressure?

“Yeah, there’s a lot of pres-
sure. People expect a lot,” Green
said. ‘‘It’s different. It's a job-
traveling from city to city. It's a
whole different life. 8 T. 1

Some would say survi,ving on
Green’s means would be a wel-
come respite. Others who know

‘Green say what means more to

him can't be bought with a fat

‘ checkbook or a big name.

“When you're poor\you learn
about survival. Now that he has
alot of money, he has to worry
about who’s his friend and who’s
his enemy,” said a friend of
Green’s who asked to remain
unnamed. “Life was more simple
for him when he was here. This is
the first time he’s been on his
own."

Mrs. Sunseri, who has known
Green since his first season at
Pitt -and later housed.Green for

most of his last year at Pitt,»

watched Green mature from a
“backward, shy" kid when he
first came to Pitt, to the man he
was when he left at the top of his
sport. She’s confident he’ll han-
dle the changes he's going
through now. _ .

_ “When he started at Pittfhis

freshmen year, his aunt Thad
raised him and it was the first
time he was away from home. He
looked around and said, ‘I hate it

ground and said it wasugly here.

EastLeague

Debate
Continues

continued from page seventeen-
Eastern 8 for another year or two
or to take their chances on the
formation ofthe new conference.

-Pitt’s athletic officials have
gone on record in. the past voic-
ing their displeasure*with the

Eastern 8 league and especially 0

its failure to land a television
contract for its games.

Despite the Eastern 8 meeting
next week, neither Billick nor
Rutgers’/Athletic Director Fred
Gruninger seems to be looking at
the Nov. 5 date as a mandatory
deadline for declaring their
intentions about the new
conference.

“We have been asked to make
a decision (about the Eastern 8)
at that time, and l have no indi-
cation the Eastern 8 is willing to
delay,” Billick said. “But I think
a decision about the conference
will have to be made in the next
couple of months. We’re coming
close to a time when a decision
has to be made.”

Said Gruninger:
“Certainly by the end ofthe year
some definite answers for or
against should be ready.”

The decision whether to com-
mit to the Eastern 8 for another
year or two complicates the pic-
ture for Pitt, who along with
Rutgers, West Virginia, Temple
and Penn State, seems willing to
get along with the formation of
the new conference after the
l98l-82 year. Pitt and West Vir-
ginia are committed to the East-
ern 8 for the upcoming season.

Billick said ”he didn’t think
scheduling would. present a large
problem for anew conference.
He predicted that schedules
could be drawn up for league
play beginning with the I982-83

’ season for basketball and the .

I982 football season.

Jack Freeman. Pitt senior vice
chancellor for administration
and a top decision,-maker on uni-
versity athletic matters, indi-
cated Monday that Pitt may be
willing to go into a new confer-
ence, but not an ill-prepared one.

“We have concerns. Wejwant
the conference executive to be a
strong one and we want the con-
ferencevto be formed in a classy
way, not offthe top ofthe head,"
Freeman said.

Given a choice,-Freeman said
Pitt would prefer to be affiliated
with some basketball league
rather than return to being inde-
pendent. He noted independents
like Penn State have had diffi-
culty with basketball scheduling
because most programs are affil-
iated with conferences.

N Y Marathon Winner

Angered By Officials

NEW YORK (AP) i Alberto
Salazar, world record holder in the
marathon. has uncharaeteristicly
vented his anger on The Athletic
Congress. the governing body for
track and field in the United States.

“I would rather get prize money
directly under—the-table than accept-

M ing it over-the—table and having to
put it in a trust fund with TAC.“
Sala7ar said Monday. one day after
settingtheworld mark with a time of

New York City
Marathon.

By takingthe winnings under—the—
table— a long—standing practice that
has been publicly ignored by TAC
and the lnternational Amateur
Athletic Federation, the world
governing body for the sport ~
athletes do not have to put the
money in escrow or a trust fund, as
someofthose openly accepting prize
money have done.

9 A prime example was New Zea-
._la.n.d.e.rs Allison Roe, female winner
of Sunday’s New York City ‘Mara-
thon in 2:25:29, a world mark for

~ women. She had received $4.000 for

finishing second in the Cascade
Run-Off at Portland, Ore. June 28.
The l5-kilometer road "race was
underlthe auspices of the Associa~

tion for Road Racing Athletes. a
rebel professional group.

Roe was suspended. meaning she
was ineligible to participate in inter-
‘nationalcompetition orthe Olympic
Games. She then agreed. however.
to put the $4.000 into a trust fund
supervised by the New Zealand Fed-
eration. and her amateur eligibility
was restored.

Meanwhile. two other long-
distance runners, Herb Lindsay of
the United States and Rod Dixon. it
native New Zealander now living in
the U.S., have agreed to put their
priie money from ARRA races into-
escrow accounts.

A TAC spokesman said the
accounts were “between the athletes
and us. if the IAAF decides at its
meeting in Rome Dec. l2-l3 thatthe
money can be used for training pur-
poses, then the money will be put
into a0 trust fund."

Salazar. labeling TAC “hypo-
crites and thieveseﬁsaid he wants no

part of trust funds.

Ollan Cassell. executive director
of TAC, was supposed to attend a
new conference Monday following a
meeting of international marathon
race directors. He failed to show.
however. “

“Wesleyan is an experienced team
with a lot of skill.” said Bemis.
“We're going to have to do every-
thing to keep the score down.“

To enhance his defense, Bemis
will use a defensive set-up likegthc

Bemis is also switching senior .lim 1‘

“Using this defensive set-up is the
only way we can play this Wesleyan
team.” said Bemis. “They’re very
tricky in the middle with their drib~
bling. We can't let them control the
ball in the midfield.“

Bemis’ team will be looking for a
big win in their last home game to
get on the right track for their next
foe. Indiana University (of Pennsyl-
