N O’ omzor defends
Marous as chair

 

By Scot Ross
,Manag1'ng Editor

University of Pittsburgh
President}. Dennis O’Connor said
yesterday that he does not want
john C. Marous Jr. to resign his
post as Board of Trustees
chairperson. _

O’Connor’s statement, which
came during the University Senate
meeting, characterized Marous’
tenure as having a positive
inﬂuence on the university.
O’Connor cited Marous’ efforts
on Pitt’s $251 million Capital
Campaign, his reform of athletics
and the “open compensation
process” as factors in his decision.

Marous has been criticized
within the university for
possessing a 165-page document
outlining the $3.3 million
retirement package for former
Pitt President Wesley Posvar
while maintaining he was
uninformed about the total
amount of the benefits.

“I think that Mr. Marous has
acknowledged the incom-
pleteness of the information he
had concerning the compensation
of the [former] president. I think

he acknowledged that it was his
responsibility to have it, but he
didn’t,” O’Connor said.

The Faculty Assembly, the
Student Government Board and
the Student Council of the College
of General Studies have all
recommended that Marous
should resign as board
chairperson.

University Senate President
Richard Tobias reported that
University Counsel Lewis Popper
informed him that an ad hoc
committee is being created by
the Board of Trustees to review
the board’s structure and
operation. Size and makeup of
the board, relations with the
university community and
legislators and rules governing

conflict of interest will be among _

the issues investigated.

Farrell Rubenstein will chair
the committee, which will be
made up of six trustees. Dr. Bruce
Jones of the School of Education
will interview 40 members of the
university community and relay
their concerns to the committee.

For The Pitt, News

A new student-loan bill has been
introduced to Congress that will base loan
repayments on the student's post-
graduation annual income. ’

The Income-Dependent Education
‘Assistance Act would be available toall
students, regardless of family income. A
family-needs analysis would not be
administered for IDEA.

“As [students’l incomes go up, they will
repay more quickly. As their incomes are
lower, [repayments] will bescaled back
and made affordable,” said George Conant,
legislative assistant to Rep. Tom-Petri (R-
Wis.)

IDEA will make up to $70,000 in loans

available for an undergraduate or graduate
student and $143,000 for a medical student.

If participants in the loan program do
not have a high enough yearly income to
repay the loan in 25 years, all remaining
debt will be dropped. However Conant
said, “You have to be very unfortunate to
have that low of [an] income over 25
years.” .

Conant noted that most people would
be able to pay their loans back in 12 to 17
years.

The program is not intended to make its
borrowers repay loans after retirement,
according to Conant. “You don’t want to
get into a situation where you’re taking
social security checks,” Conant said. “You
don’t want to get into a situation where
you’re preventing people from helping

their own kids go to school.”
7Repayments would be withheld as part

of income taxes by the Internal Revenue

Service. This would eliminate the

opportunity for loan default because

evading repayment would be considered
tax evasion.

IDEA would serve_as a loan program to
supplement other standing student
programs. “It’s supplementary in that
we're not taking things away from students, ”

‘Conant said. “We’re giving them another

option.”

With IDEA there would not be any
additional fees. “If you borrow a dollar,
you get a dollar for your education,"
Conant said. The repayment schedule

would be automatically restructured if ‘
. participants lose their jobs or take time off

 

.;oan program would base payments on post—graduation income  

from work to raise children.

The IDEA program wouldlusei

government capital instead of bank capital,

which would save the government the _A

high cost of bank interest rates.
“Right nowwe’re trying to get it included
in the reauthorization of the Higher

Education Act,” Conant said. “If IDEA is - 4
not included in that, it's thetype of thing .

that can go as a stand-alone bill ‘as well.”

In the House, the bill is co—sponsored by
29 Democrats and 31 Republicans. Sen.
David Durenberger (R-Minn.) intf0dUC€d

the bill to the Senate on Aug. 2, 1991‘. iP,€1iﬂ' —
introduced the bill to the House of.»

Coping on Campus

 7 Learning to manage college stress yourself

Stress is a normal part of our
everyday life, and in fact some
stress, such as the kind that
motivates us to study for an exam,
canbe helpful. When the quantity
or the intensity of the stresses we

' * encounter become too great,

however, we may find ourselves
faced with emotional and physical
health problems that can interfere
with college life.

College students are prime
targets for stress overload. The
combined pressures of academic
work, high parental expectations,
intense and sometimes fragile
relationships, career uncertainty,
thehighs and lows of the party
scene and a variety of value
conflicts can become
overwhelming at times.

Students seem to know when
they are “feeling stressed out”
and generally also seem to know
how they can avoid or reduce

the stress in their lives. Most

know, for instance, that they can
better cope with stress when they
follow a good diet (especially
reasonable caffeine intake),
exercise regularly and get
adequate rest. Many students also
know that they can reduce their

 

   

   Rea
Gallagher

stress if they organize their lives
better, become more tolerant of
themselves and others and
practice -relaxation techniques
(yoga, meditation, ,deep

_breathing) for short periods of

time each day.

The problem is that although’
people usually know how they
can reduce stress,‘ they often do
not believe that the power to do
so is within their control.
Frequently they cling to old
childhood beliefs that external
forces (luck, fate, the good or

University Democrats plan
voter strategy for Wofford

By Suzann Gries
For T be Pitt News

University Democrats are planning a campaign to help keep
Sen. Harris Wofford in the U.S. Senate.

The group met in the Cathedral of Learning last night to
discuss possible strategies to aid Wofford’s campaign. Several of
the group’s members will be handing out ﬂyers advocating
Wofford’s campaign.

Other members of the group will be telephoning and building
coalitions with some of the larger organizations at Pitt, such as
the Black Action Society. They may be hosting a rally in support
of Sen. Wofford. The University Democrats also plan to extend
their campaign to Carnegie Mellon as well. '

The group supports Wofford because of his political stance on
the issues of education, civil rights, abortion and health care.

, Wofford advocates the national health—Care system and is pro-
choice. Wofford voted in favor of the Democratic Civil Rights Act
and helped create the Peace Corps.

The University Democrats are optimistic about Wofford’s
campaign against Richard Thornbu rgh. “Everybody said that this

 guy can’t run against T hornburgh, but there is a definite
possibility that Wofford will win, ” University Democrats President
Joel Leonard said.

Wofford, who was the president of Bryn Mawr College for 10
years and a close personal friend of Martin Luther__King Jr., is
highly qualified for the position, according to Leonard.

Shawn McClearn, vice president of the University Democrats,
said, “The difference between Wofford and Thornburgh is
Wofford works for us, and Thornburgh works for Thornburgh.

Thornburgh sees this merely as a stepping stone for the
presidency, and Thornburgh’s behavior in the past demonstrates
this.”

If you depend on your computer to
be more than a word processer, graduatr I
ing to a NeXTstation" computer may be
the smartest course you evertake.

While we can't promise a NeXTsta- '
tion will carry you all the way through
college in a month, we can promise it
will carry you all the way through col-
lege. And graduate school. And, pardon
the expression, the real world.

GRADUATE IN
OCTOBER.  

That's because no other desktop
computer brings such a full suite of
workstation features to bear on such a
wide range of research, analysis, report
writing. and problem solving tasks.

Features like a high-performance 15- '

A MlPS CPU, a.minimum of8 MB of
RAM and 105 MB of hard disk storage,
a full UNIX“ operating system, true
multitasking. 3D graphics, and built-in V
Ethernet networking. _

And no other desktop computer sur-
rounds this much power with the easy-
to-use graphical interface —. and the‘
easy—to—live-with price — of a personal
computer.

With the right software, it’s all the ’.
computer any college student needs. ‘

And between August 15 and October
31, we‘ll make acquiring the right soft-
ware practically painless.

Buy any NeXT" CPU between now
and then and get WordPerfcct? the pre-
mier word processor, SoftPC°,’ the AT-
class MS-DOS°emulator, and Diagram.V',
the powerful drawing and diagramming
package, for less than $300. That's near-
ly $1400 worth of the most popular pro- -
ductivitytools available for less than
$300 bucks.

What's more, graduating to a NeXT
computer doesn‘t require a lot of prereq-
uisites. Just a visit to a campus reseller.

And now's the time to do it.

Because the sooner you
graduate, the easier college,-
will become. 3

.It’s about time

The lack of accountability of the Board of Trustees has

5 .. icreated noticeable problems at the University of Pittsburgh.

Spending, ethics and ignorance have topped the list of
difficulties the board has been dealing with.
' _l In order to alleviate the confusion, the board announced

. that it would conduct an investigation of relevant issues,

such as relations with the university community and
legislators, rules governing conﬂict of interest and the size
and operation of the board.

An ad hoc committee, which is made up of six members,

is A was designed in June for the internal study.

. The board should be praised for its decision to investigate
the infractions within the board, but the committee is

 _rnade up solely of six BOT members — which may only

cause more problems, since this is hardly an objective

I ‘ group.

Although the members of the committee were chosen

S ‘because they each had “specific ideas” about ways to

reform the board, the faculty and staff of Pitt are not being

is . equally represented.

‘Withoutdirect representation, a vital portion of the

P A‘ = university community may continue to be ignored.

Dr. Bruce Jones of the School of Education is scheduled
to interview 40 members of the Pitt community and report

i  their concerns to the ad hoc committee.

Who these “members” are has not yet been clarified, but
SGB President Brent Saunders has been named the CAS
undergraduate contact, along with -College of General
Studies President Marcie Roberts, who will represent
undergrads in CGS. I _

“I’m not sure that a committee‘ consisting exclusively of
trustees will really understand what itis that we may want
to talk about with them,” said economics professor

’ Herbert Chesler.

Chesler also believes that one way to educate the

I committee is for Pitt faculty to be members.

The creation of this group comes during a crucial time
at Pitt. Ex—Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s retirement package,

 P" A the call for John Marous’ resignation by three university

organizations and the superﬂuous “research” spendingby

i » university officials have disrupted the board and decreased
‘the faith of the university community within the past six

months.
An internal investigation is a necessity, but the ad hoc

Speedy Jells makes opposing secondariestakenoticei

 By Rob Pugliese

.-

Staff Writer

As the old saying goes, speed
kills.
The Pitt Panthers know that

. better than anyone but in recent

years they have been the victim
of speed rather than the initiator.

Times are changing for Pitt
and Dietrich Jells is the new
executioner.

The first-year wideout sizzled
Maryland for a 58-yard
touchdown reception that knotted
the score at seven and steered the
Panthers back on course toward
its 24-20 victory Saturday at Pitt
Stadium. This was especially
gratifying for a young player who
has had his share of rookie
problems.

“It felt good because I’ve had
a couple of opportunities that
I’ve squandered,” Jells said.

Coming out of Tech Memorial
High School in Erie, Jells carried
a reputation as a speed demon,
with a 4.3 time in the 40-yard
dash. He was named to the
Parade All-American squad and
to Blue Chip rnagazine’s all—star
team. But enteringthe season,
Jells was not expected to be a
_big-irnpact player for the Panthers.
Against West Virginia and
Southern Mississippi, he saw very
limited action. ‘ .

Then Panther fans watched
Jells drop the first pass thrown to

him, a bomb against Temple that .

would have gone for a long
touchdown. But later in that game
Jells wowed the crowd with a 46-
yard touchdown. .
"Against Minnesota, Jells was
too far ahead of his defenders,
and a potential touchdown pass
bounced right off his helmet. The
Terrapins were not so fortunate,
however. After his long
touchdown, Jells’ name did not
land in the stat sheet for any
further receptions or rushing
yardage, but Mary1and’s defense
double-covered him on several
occasions, obviously wary of
another toasting. 8
“This kind of speed we have
not seen around here in a while,”
Pitt head coach Paul Hackett said

Dame's 75, Malone College's 89,
Eastern Michigan’s 95 and Central
Michigan’s 136.

“During the week I realized.
that I only have four meets left in
my collegiate career,” Formica
said of his victory. “I didn’t want
to look back and regret that I
didn’t run hard while I had the
chance."

It is a good thing he didn’t look
back. Forrnica’s strong drive over
the final 300 meters narrowly
edged Augustana’s Sandu
Rebenciuc and Malone’s Ira
Wentworth by one second.
Forrnica’s time of 24:26 for five

miles also carried him to his
second consecutive personal
record this season.

Backing Formica’s performance
was Jason Bodnar’s personal

record of 24:38, which earned.

him fourth place.

So how does a team that places
first and fourth in a major
invitational wind up fifth? “Our
first and second guys are great,"
said third man Steve Forrester,
“but from third to seventh man
we have a lot of work cut out for
us.” Forrester’s 25:34 earned him
36th place and was just three
seconds off his best time. “We

know ._we have the talent,"
Forrester said, “but we just aren’t
racing the way we’re capable."
Doing some of that “work” is
sophomore Brian McCollough.
His 43rd-place finish in a personal
record of 25:43 proves that there
still is a glimmer of hope for the

remaining Panther pack. Also,

' scoring for Pittwas Craig Woshner

in 25:57 (6150, Mike Lynn in
26:14 (83rd) and Jamie Hibell in
28:04 (135th).

Once again the women’s cross-
country team unleashed its
powerful 1-2-3 punch — which
soon may see a fourth.

Carmela Mariani (6th in 18:12),
Laura O’Donnell (12th in 18:37)

and Stacey Wyzykowski (14th in _ 5

' 18:40) was Jen Hrach’s 21st finish

in a personal record of 18:45. Her , 7’

performance fueled Pitt’s third-
place finish out of 20 teams.
Also scoring for Pitt were Judy

Facey (64th in 19:37) and Katina : 5

Miles (100th in 20:56).

The next meet for both the 5

men’s and women’s cross-

country teams will be the City.

‘football team has had this year
carry over into the crowd. The
fans seemed to really want to be
there andnot just because they
had a ticket and didn’t want to
waste it.

Next, it was a_ great touch
passing out the gold pompons to
the students. They should do that
at every game —— or at least at
every televised or “big” game.
Also, the cheerleaders, Panther
and Golden Girls seemed to be
more interactive with the crowd,

probably because the crowd was .

being more responsive to ‘them,
and everybody just fed on each
other’s actions.

The band did an outstanding
job with its timing of favorite
themes such as “Na-na, Hey— Hey
Kiss Him Goodbye,” the Pitt Fight
Song and the newly acquired
song from the Pittsburgh

.  '  ' in I  F I H F — I I A V l ‘ THE PITI‘ 1;lEWS,Tuesday/, October 8, 1991
Pitt football brings

back enthusiasm
for Panther fans

Penguins. -

Also, in the fourth quarter, it
was an excellent touch when the
Pitt band split into two groups
playing in unison, one at the foot
of the student section and one at
the top of the student section.
That really got the crowd ﬁred
up, especially in the last three
minutes of the game, when the
Pitt crowd was as loud as it has
-been in years. 4

But I thought the overall
excitement was topped off by
allowing the students to come
down onto the field after the
game to congratulate the players
and really enjoy being part of
such a fantastic finish. This is a
tradition that Pitt used to have
years ago.

The band would play at
midfield, and the spectators could
come down and be part of the
postgame festivities first-hand.

But since Pitt installed a new
astroturf, that tradition was
stopped in order to prevent excess
wear and tear on the field. So
running down on the field after
the game to show support for the
Pitt football team was icing on
the cake for an overall exciting
day.

So there were indeed two
things to cheer about last Saturday
at Pitt Stadium. The first one was
the outcome of the game, which
left Pitt as one of 10 teams
remaining unbeaten in the
country.

Second was the fact that it was
fun again to be in the stands at
the game.

emergence, we ﬁnally have some vertical push. All of the sudden
people become conscious that, ‘Oh, 26 is in the game.’ The second
time he came down the field, you could see it.”

Hackett has brought his weapon along slowly in this complicated
system but is now seeing dividends that will mtiltiply in time. After
all, Jells and quarterback Alex Van Pelt are just beginning tolearn
about each other’s tendencies on the field. .

Hackett intends to involve Jells in the offense more as the weeks
pass. Saturday, Jells stayed in the game for a significant number of
snaps and actually carried the ball on an end-around in the third

quarter.

. “Every week he gets a little bit better; we got him in the ﬂow just
a little bit more today,” Hackett said. “I think the possibilities are
endless, over the next year and a half, what those two guys can do

together. I’m thrilled."

“He’s a real positive inﬂuence,” Jells said of his quarterback. “He
never gets down on you; he's truly the leader of the offense.”

Jells said he doesn’t want to press too much in his first season,and
remains calmeven after dropping a fewpasses.

“I’m just working harder. I just want to eliminate mental errors,
really concentrating more, studying more, practicing more,” he said.

The adjustment process between Tech Memorial and Pitt has been

a complex one.

“The biggest adjustment for me has been from a defensive
standpoint, having to read coverages more and knowing my
assignments,” Jells said. “Junior Green has taught me a lot, and Cliff
Moncrief, Chad Askew. If I make a mistake, they’l1 say, ‘It’s no big

deal. Just stick in there.’”

This Saturdayjells and the 5-0 Panthers travel to South Bend, Ind.,
where they will meet eighth—ranked Notre Dame.

“This game will definitely be the biggest game of my athletic career
so far,” Jells said. “To be 5-0 is great, and winning this game would
be one of the greatest experiences of my life." I

Wofford —

Continued from page 3

“He started out as a relatively
moderate Republican governor,
and when he got to Washington
he got a taste of the executive
branch and liked it so much that
he is willing to change his tune
every time he needs to in order
to get himself one step closer to
the White House,” McClearn said.

Recently, some of the signs put
up by the University Democrats
have been tampered with.
McClearn attributes this to

0 “people [who] don’t like points
of view that differ radically from '

their own.”
The University Democrats were
reorganized last spring, but they

. aspire to be as inﬂuential at Pitt"

as the Penn State College
Democrats are at State College,
according to Leonard.

“Penn State Democrats

' consistently call people and put

up yard signs. If a candidate
wants to win, they need their
support,” Leonard said.

The University Democrats

"distributed voter registration

forms, and as of 4:15 p.m.
yesterday 400 voters registered,
most of them Democrats.

“Less than 20 were Republicans,
but we feel that voting is a right
that all people have, regardless
of their political views,” Leonard
said.
