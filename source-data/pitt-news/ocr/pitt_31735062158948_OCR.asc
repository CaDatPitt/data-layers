Mr. W hitehill was director of the
college "theater at Marshall col-
lege, Huntington, West Virginia
for two and one-half years.

Considered an outstanding part
of the equipment of “Ceiling
Zero" is its set—-the operations V of-
ﬁce of la transcontinental airline
at a Newark, New Jersey airport,
where all three acts of the play
take place. The Players’ technical
staff, after many long hours of
work on the set, agreed that it is
one of the most ambitious sets
ever attempted for a Players’
show.

REALISTIC SETS

Every effort is being made by
Director Whitehill to secure real-
ism for the ‘play, for much of its
effect depends upon the audience’s
hearing sounds and themselves
supplying the accompanying pic-
ture in their minds. Planes will
be heard warming up, taking off,
landing, and even crashing. The
radio operator will talk to pilots
as they guide their ships through
the airlanes, and the audience will
also hear the replies of those
pilots.

Property Manager Ione Wil-
liams, C38, has visited all the
neighboring airports as well as
many other types of firms in the
city in her efforts to secure auth-
entic properties, and to obtain

necessary pilots’ uniforms and
equipment. A
Office equipment valued at

$1,000 has ben loaned by General
Fireprooﬁng company. Parachutes,

Associate Professor of English

So—Journeyman has learned to
wear mittens and play in the
snow. For the ﬁrst time, this
once-fragile childof spring bears
a “Winter” date line, and under

weather. Journeyman, says its
editor, William R. Murray, has
this ‘year “approached more near-
ly than ever before a professional
standard.”
POETRY INCLUDED

In keeping with this policy, the
editors have printed ﬁve poems
and eight prose offerings of vary-
ing lengths and diverse types.
Throughout, the aim has evidently
been to present fully-developed
units, and to exclude what the
editors call “writing done to show
method,” particularly “descriptive
pieces.” .

The poetry is written by Jean
Barnes, Betty Friedman, Milton
G. Lehman, Jr., and Grace Ellis.
Social comment, pure imagery,
experiment in euphonics, cosmic
dialogue, the-world-not-well-lost
—-—that is the substance. And there
is much to commend: the human
warmth of Miss Barnes’ “Our

present as many points of view
as there are writers.

On the critical or informative
side we have three formal essays:
John Martinco’s “Journalism in
the Movies”; A. Carini’s “Baro-
que”; and “The New Mozart,” by
Robert Brown. Mr. Martinco ar-
gues against the current Holly-
wood portrait of the swashbuck-
ling reporter, pleading for a more
realistic View of the newspaper

profession. The second essay, in
a style adapted to the subject,
pictures the origin -of baroque

sculpture in Spain, then explains
its unique development in Mexi-
co; this article is illustrated by
two of Philip El1iot_t’s excellent
photographs. In “The New Mo-
zart” Robert Brown brings all his
enthusiasm to a favorite theme,
the modern estimate of the great
Austrian composer.

The remaining pieces are more
strictly imaginative. John Cos-
grove gives the title “Let's Go
Broke Again” to a charming per-
sonal essay—a nostalgic, whimsi-
cal glance backward to the years
when Time had no money value
and hence could be spent freely.
Then there are two sketches which
stand in marked contrast. Peter
Mathews’ “Surrealist” mocks to-
day’s cult of the ugly and unintel-
ligible, letting the surrealist him-
self explain his ideals. In\“Sou-

New Course Requires

Immediate Action

0 the l.'ni\'c1*sit.‘y's Curriculum Cllzmge
TC3onin1it.tec ;\'[on(lay went a report of Stu-
dent Faciilty Association's coinmittcc on
Eugenics and Eutlieiiics with a request that
such a. course be in the college curriculum be-
beginning l’l€‘Xl'. scnicstcr.

The fate of tho report~—thc rcsult now of
almost: a _vca.1"s investigating of both the need
for the hiclusion of the course at the l.7niver-
sity and the results of such courses at other
institutions--is now largely in the hands of
the facility.

Wln-n stiidciits pushed the measure through
Stuclent F‘acul’r_v Ass0ciation’s assembly last
year on an _c3:pe!-iincntfal. basis, the response
was so great. that the six-wccks, non-credit
coursc was immediately limited to seniors, and
only tliirty of the two hundred applicants were
admitted.

But even. in that short,’ trial period the course
was a. rnai-kc<jl success. Students, rcsponcl.ing
to a (picstionnairc, claiinccl tlicy had obtaiuccl
inf‘ormation of a type and quality which they
had not and could receive in any other Uni-
versity course. Almost unanimously they dc-
c~.la.red that ilic course should be included in
the general. l."11i\'e1fsi’r_v curriculum.

With the local project justiﬁcd from a stu-
dent viewpoint, the committee tapped most
of the information available on such courses
at other colleges by contacting instructors and
1l(llllllllSll“fill\’€ officers.

Again the information obtained pointed. to
an ovcrwlielmlng success and a. desire that
such courses be adopted universally. As one
instructor expressed her attitude: “I had to
push aside other duties in order to answer
your lettcr—-for anything I can do to help the
furtlierance of marriage courses in our colleges
I am eager to attend to at once.”

And -now the decision rests largely with
the fa.culty’s Curriculum Change Commit-
tee. B Students have proved not only that the
course is practical but also that it is nec-
esw. ’

-The request that the course be included
next semester is justified. We ask that the
usual red tape and any departmental
jealousies that might develop be dispensed
with at once. Immediate action is desirable,
especially with the mass of information at
hand.

Press, Industrialists
Purposely Mistake NLRB

HE National Labor Relations Board is tak-

ing a. body beating from every anti-labor
source in America, most‘ especially from the”
union-hating press.

’l‘here is no doubt that the NLRB has made
its mistakes. A commission with as large a
group of powers, and as large a‘ territory as
NLRB has to cover, cannot help but make a
few.

But it has done nothing to merit‘ the storm
of criticism aroused against it in the past few
days.

Anti-union papers, such as the highly re-
spected loca.l paper-—rcspected by the unknow-
ing as being Pittsburgh ’s only liberal paper—-
have evidently been waiting for one big mis-
take by the labor board, so that it could lay
its ﬁnger on that error, and point out to the
unknowing that the board “tackles none other
than Article 1 of the Bill of Rights of the Con-
stitution of the United States.” _, h T

This is a very ﬁne-sounding phrase which
goes to the roots of our emotions. Freedom. of
the Press, the Article 1 of the Bill of Rights of
the Constitution of the United States, is the
basis of the attack on NLRB-

Now let’slook the thing over.

Frccddin of the Press is a grand tl1ing——we
at the Pitt. News have fought for it as late as
this semester-—, but-a paper printing an arti-
cle cannot get behind the skirts of Freedom of
the Press in printing an untrue article. The

article, editorial, or column in question ‘may

be printed. And, if it is not true, Freedom of
the Press cannot be the excuse. '

A small-time, small-town paper, the,“cour~
agcous” Mill and Factory, _,(from its vcry»na.n1c

upon the NLRB. _ .

NLRB, resenting this ,att':ic;-k, because it felt
that thc,a.tt.a.ck was based‘ upon ifalsc premises,
(as most of the editorial attacks have been),

 the editor,  poctically named Hartley

ground he us__ccl in order to write the article.

_HT‘ll__(? small-itown editor, with a gleam in his
eye, and a. lick at‘ his chops, (and an eye to hav-
ing his nainci put into the big papers), got up
on his \Vcirton Steel Coinpany rostrum, and
hollcrcd, but loudly, “xmiﬁling the press! NLRB
mufﬂcs the press!” ~

We submit that nothing of the sort was
meant by NLRB. Seeking to answer its critics,
by pointing out that tlieir criticism.s were
f_l;"l'Ollll(l-l€SS-—-£l]l(‘l doing this by means of show-
ing up a. poor background of labor knowledge
(or a distinct, and overl_\;' obvious editorial 
bias), NLRB made no cﬁi'ort to muﬁlc, merely
matlu :-in cffort to corrcct mistatcmcnts.

And so, all. this raving about gcttiiig rid of

‘like to lose a good job. And so,

the present board, a. policy which appcars to
ha ve been a long timc aim of the national press,
is set off tln.-ougli the ravings of a company;

Pittpourri . . .
By g7!/[ary Lewis

The freedom of the Press must go on even tho ’tis
said that many young things have lost their berth
since mama started to read Pittpourri to keep
posted on the doings of the younger set. Perhaps
this is the long sought explanation for the poor
circulation of the News in student homes. Have
you no backbone, young things, and uren’t you
willing to credit your mama with enough intelli-
gence to wish for you a “liberal education.”

Bob Leon was a track star on the 1936 American
Olympic team, and his English prof used to think
he was a good clean kid. Bob is a. little worried
now since his prof asked him, as he arrived breath-
less and latcfor class, whether it was the breeze-‘
that madelhim sway all the day down Fifth Ave-
nue Friday nite. Don’t you worry Bob, we still
think you’re a- good clean kid!

The business ability of Art Rogow and Babe Stark
has always been .1 marvel to their friends. That
is always up until F‘iday when the boys were
taken for a loss at 50c an alley. Ah, the upsets
that are going on about us!

Speaking‘ of upsets, what was Dottie Abrams doing
at the Schenley the other nite sans Frank Patrick.
And him a successful ballplayer, too, Dottie.
Chuck Vvright was a bit upset for fear a. certain
blond from across the Hollow might read that
Chuck was dancing with a. Pittite Friday nite.
How did it come out, Chuck? Did she miss that
edition?

Bill Colker looked veerry, veerry dreamy the other
day and if asked the reason, he would slowly tell
you that a (late with one of these shag dancers at
the Stanley last week would make a better man
than he look dreamy.

That was a swell dance, Leonard, and the souvenirs
were really novel—-bruises on the in-step and lungs
collapsed from smoke and carbon dioxide. Such
souvenirs as these last long enough to let every-
body see how popular one is. Don’t hold it against
D. C. Shultz when you see him walking around
shivering without an overcoat, He did have one,
honest; a $22.50 from Richmans but that was long
ago, before the Duke game.

Ray Light is hunting around for somebody’s beer
to cry in since Mary Richmond bid him farewell.
Keep your chin up Ray—i’c happens to the best of
us. Esther Conlin and Dagwood (-or is it Ellwood)
are engaged and we wish ‘them luck. But don’t
leave us too soon, Esther.

Interviews

“Student nev.*spapc1~s‘do”not say“;
what they think because they’re
not thinking anything,” said
James Donoghue, C37, editor of
Oakland News.

After three years of meditation
and study, James came to the
conclusion that student publica-
tions “print the news too late and
consequently never have ‘spot
stories;’ that they are at 21 disad-
vantage because they are ﬁnanced
by pressure groups rather than by
an individual; and are essentially
a house organ, printing news of
interest to the few, and contain-
ing‘ mostly publicity stories of
dances, etc.”

“College newspapers,” he said,
“are necessary, but not sufficiently
justified for the amount of money
spent for them.”

Donoghue has been editor of the
Oakland News for two years, and

during that time, a tragedy oc-

curred. It happened at the News}
printing office. The pressrnazzn

Sound and Fury

By JAMES R.

DONOGHUE

'l‘hc <‘ss<‘utial point about an cduczitional system, it has been

said, is the kind of people it produces.

the only thing that were to be

ll.owcvcr_, if this wcrc
(‘.()llSl(l(‘lf't‘(l, ‘the problem. ‘W(‘>‘Ill(l

boil down (‘lllll"(‘l}' to an (‘-..\:an1i11ation of the kind of gr:-irluatcs

schools produce.

The fact that upsets the calculat'io11s of the plrilosoplim is

that sometimes exceptionally edu-9

cated persons are produced in:
spite of the system; and that of;
the exceptional individuals of the
age they comprise the greater;
part.

Now every age advances some-
thing of import in education, per- ,
haps a new technique: as the com- 
ing of radio opened new channels
of learning; or a new motivation:
as the rise ofdemocracy in west-
ern Europe prompted mass educa-
tion. , .

Interest In Forms

The ideas behind the age may
range from a conception of the
importance of the individual, and
thus the necessity of training him;
or it may stress the integrated na-
ture of society and insist on the
need for producing individuals of
approximately the same educated
level.

However, the societies, although

stant and unusually morally good,
tend as they grow older to become
increasingly interested in the
forms rather than the content of
the educational process.

Thus, accepted modes of
thought are demanded, conform-
ity to the mores is required, and
in some cultures, the very build-
ings themselves come under ex-
amination as hibiting or inhibit-
ing the development of knowledge
and thus achieve status as sym-
bols. It is needless to remark
here that the forest is lost in the
midst of examining the trees.

Stimulation or Acceptance

And. it is equally bootless to
point out that practically all peo-
ples have agreed that education is
the process of training the young
of the species for an adequate ad-
justment to the environment; and
the methods of training them, un-
less mistaken for the substance
itself, can generally be agreed up-
on even by people who disagree
as to the substance or the ends of
education.

The basic question of educa-
tion, as it is of politics or the
state, is of and for whom. Shall
the young be educated to accept
a prevailing system; or shall they
be stimulated to examine the sub-
stance and the forms of the socie-
ty they live under, as they"are
taught to do with other societies?

long run, to whether the school. is
intended as an adjunct of the
church and the state in teaching
morals or whether it is not to be
that.

The answer to this question not
only solves the problem as to What
kind of an educational system a
particulau: one is but also testifies
to the’ products which it turns out.
In education one cannot any more
make a silk purse out of 3 sow’s
car than one can in trade or pol-
itics or art.

Panther dribblers in last weck’s
tune-up games, with the Akron
Pros, the starting lineup for the
inaugural contest is undecided at
present.

fourth time in Panther bzislietlaalli

before, is an inveterate optimist.
