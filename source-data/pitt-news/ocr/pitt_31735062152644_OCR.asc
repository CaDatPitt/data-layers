paper to our football coach. Your
article voices the sentiment ‘of many
of the students and alumni with whom
.I have been speaking,'and is most as-
suredly deserved by Duff. _ A '.

I‘ have ‘had the opportunity of
watching Pitt coaches‘ and. the teams
for the past eight years and I‘ am
positive that A no. coach -has accom:
plished -results that can equal those

been changedfrom old-‘style, anti-
quated, ﬁstic engag ents to“ clean-
cut, determined athletic effort under.
the present stall’ of coaches. Pitt is

in the "football world both for ability
in intercollegiate sports and for un-
questionable athletitc ‘relations. This
is entirely due to the system of "Duff
and his associates and the integrity of
our athletic director. - .

I would like to say further that it
matters little whom we haveV for a
coach if he is going to allow the sport-
ing‘ writers of the Pittsburgh papers
014 the athletic committee VV to tell him
whom to play, and what -to do on the
ﬁeld. GiveADuﬂ:' or any new‘ man a
chance to use his method‘ and if itA
fails then seek another.- If .Warner
comes here the‘ team will be run {by
him and noone else.  A V A

The material Pitt 'posfses’ses to-day
is the best she has ever had, and the
-result Duﬂ’ has obtained is the best
showing Pitt has ever“ma‘de -on a foot:

numbering 300, and is regarded as one
of th eforemost educational institu-
‘tions in the United'_ ‘States. Plans
-have been complete for the erection
of 25 new buildings on a campus of
47 acres, situated in the best part of
the city-—the Belleﬁeldl district-—.
which is within a stone’s. throw of
Forbes Field. ' s  _
v I The student may study‘ law, medi-
cine,‘ dentistry, pharmacy, engineer-
ing and the regular arts and science
courses offered inthe big Eastern col-
,1eges,and'for that reason the regis-
tration has increased .from' 1200 to
3000 in five years. With all of these
students‘ from which to choose,_‘is it
any wonder Pitt has a strong football
team? Nowadays, the prep school
star is seeking an education as well as
honors on the gridiron, so he selects
an institution offering the course that
best suits him. The annual-fall rush
for Yale, Harvard, Princeton and
other leading universities has dimin--
ished considerably with each year, and
the good high school player is just
as likely to,matriculate_l in Siwashsor
Swatling as ‘anyfother lace.
_ There are any nu ber of prep
schools in and near Pittsburgh that
furnish athletes, for Pitt. “ Graduates
of - aBellefonte . Academy’, f‘Kiski,”
Shadyside, East‘ Liberty, Allegheny
Prep, Indiana Normal “and ﬁve high
schools in the city are now matricu-

At first the college, iwhich was then
called the Western- University of
Pennsylvania was not very successful
on the gridiron, although the ﬁrst big

victory was ‘ registered over’ Penn‘

State that‘ year. From then on the

'team‘_began‘to get "stronger, until now

it compares
ranks. _  _ _ A V
. Until‘ the game’ ,with :Washington’
and Jefferson ‘a week ago, Pitt had not
suffered defeat. Cornell, the Navy,

_with any in the college

Carlisle and Georgetown were beaten,

and it looked as if the elevenwould
go through “the season with‘ a clean
slate. Bob-Folwell’s charges put . a
blot Won the ‘escutcheon, however by
winning out by the score of 13 to ,.10.
But it was no disgrace to be beaten by
Washington and Jefferson this ‘year.
No story about the University °of

Pittsburgh would be complete without
mention of Alfred'R.- Hamilton,.class
of 1894.. Mr. ‘Hamilton is the father
of college athletics at Pittsburgh, and
it is due -to his untiring efforts and
loyal support that Pitt has made such
a remarkable ‘showing. Yale has her
Walter ."CaInp, but 0 the -University’ of

Pittsburgh has her ‘Alfred R. Han!il- ‘

ton. It may be a daring thing tosay
but Mr. Hamilton has done s much,
if notjinore, for Pitt than r. Camp
has for Yale.‘
in jtheiiark days, and his interest-has
not waned,..- ' - '
