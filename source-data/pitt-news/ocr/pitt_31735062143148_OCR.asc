day, Feb. 24, and continue until 2 a. in. Sunday, ,March 9.
For the 15 fraternities on campus the two week rushing period

points in the spring season with several social events scheduled

 

at the various houses, and two all-9

school dances on Feb. 28 an
March 7. , '
p The rules of rushing remain
-‘rnuch the same; the two week
period was instituted because of
scheduling difﬁculties and because
in
"pledging.

’ Although each fraternity may
,vary from the program slightly,
the following is a general schedule
for the six days of activity per-
initted. during the rushing period.
 On Wednesdays, the various fra-
ternitieswill have luncheons and
probably dinners with stag parties
in the evening. In the afternoons
bowling parties and movies are
planned. '

on both Friday evenings, no ac-
tivities are slated by the rushing
groups,

, Saturday night is the big night
of both weeks, when mixed social

the new freshmen, it will be their

upperclassmen, the Hello Again

from last semester, and will be
just the place to make new

Betsy Sachs, chairman of the
event, announces that “There is
plenty of room, in the mosque for
you and your friends. The ‘cramp-
ed’ feeling that is associated with
most dances is alleviated by the
size of the mosque ballroom.”

Pitt Hi-Hatters orchestra strikes
up the opening dance at 3130 p.m.

feature Barbara Owens, Pitt al-

Wuslich, formerly with Charlie
Spivak’s band, leads the all-vet-
eran orchestra in the all-time
favorite songs that make student
dances successful. .

The dance will be the fourth
Student congress sponsored event
of the year. Future tea dances this
year may lean heavily on the out-
come of the Hello Again Hop, in-
asmuch as student participation
in social events is a primary aim

‘Contest Board

Declines to Vote
On Kaye Entries

Gushy poems, swathed, in
corpses and catsup, “yearned,
turned, and burned” the student
and faculty judges of the Sam-
my’ Kaye Poetry contest into al-
ternate ﬁts of laughter and gloom,
when the contest entries were read
at a meeting of the judges yes-
terday. ‘

The board of judges unanimous-
ly decided that no entry was
worthy of a prize. Consequently,
the local prize of $10 was voted
by the Pitt News, sponsors of the
contest, to be donated to Pitt in
China.

No Prizes ' .

Visions of local prize awards
and national recognition exploded
in the faces of Pitt poets as the
board adjourned its meeting,
jocular about the phrasing that
entrants called poetry.

Edwin L. Peterson,

retreated to the quiet of his of-
lﬁc-e, “I wouldn’t have believed

”it if I iradn’t beenihere.” Dr. W.

George Crouch, associate profes-
sor of English, restrained himself
and commented that “The stu-
dents could have done much bet-
ter.” ,
“Weren’t Romantic”

Citing the examples “cozey,
sticky mire” and of “man, the
brute”, Emily G. Irvine, assist-

ant professor of English, complain-
ed that the poems “weren’t ro-

mantic”. Marie Mcswigan, direc-
tor of the University news service,
decided that “There was no fresh-
ness in the poems that did not
border on facetiousness.”

William McElwain, advisor to
student publications, came to the
conclusion that the students
“didn’t know what a poem was”.
Bob Levis, student judged, laugh-
ed as he quipped that the verse
“was a little too light and poor-
ly written.” “But,” he added, “a
poem like one of these may win
the national prize.” 1

‘Poets Fired or Dead

“These poets must have either
been tired or dead” Pat Seger
said, as she dashed out for a
breath of fresh air. Tillie Sanker,
editor of the Pitt News-, returned
to her office, after reading the
poems to the judging board,
limp from excessive emotion,
only to whisper before she col-
lapsed, “No soap!”

Little Congressional Record . . . ’

Festival Main Ball Informal V
By Student Congress Action

Student Congress, in one of its
busiest sessions this year, decreed
at its last Tuesday meeting that
the main dance of the Spring
Festival be an informal affair, and
passed on three other resolutions
effecting University students.

Decision to make the Spring
Festival dance an informal affair
came after Bob Griewahn, Fes-
tival business manager, told the
members of congress that the fes-
tival committee favored a com-
promise which would make the
affair semi-formal.

Decides On Informal

Following a brief debate, Stu-
dent Congress voted to make the
affair informal on the grounds
that a semi-formal affair is so-
cially incorrect, and that a formal
dance might keep some students
away.

Grover McCann then took the
lead in proposing new legislation.

1As chairman of the congress’s

constitutional committee McCann
ﬁrst asked that an amendment to
the amending procedure be offer-
ed to the students at the next
general election. Under the terms
of this amendment it would be
possible for amendments to be

Rodd, Jr., who brought this mat-
ter to the attention of the student ,
body in a letter printed by the
Pitt News, will present the vet-
eran’s viewpoint. - -

' . The Veterans association is in
_ favor of a University sponsored
housing program, while the ad-
ministration feels that greater
beneﬁts ” will result from using
the new buildings ‘to increase lab-
oratory and classroom space.

-Pitt’s contribution to the World
Student Service fund, following
the soliciting drive, Jan. 13-17,
stands at $1500. “Although this
ﬁgure is double last year’s record,
it is less than 10 per cent of the
total reported by the University J

able registration totals.

complaints concerning food prices.
Betty Wood and Melrose Fleming
objected, saying that they felt
that such an inquiry would be
construed to be‘ an “inquisition.”
After Grover McCann’s assurance
that there was no intent to dis-
parage the integrity of the inter-
viewees the motion was carried
unanimously,

Bill Zefﬁro, chairman of the
main dance, presented Spring
Festival's ‘biggest problem to con-
gress, namely, the lack of a suit-
able hall for the grand ball. Mr.
Zefﬁro pointed out that the only
date now available is May 24 at
which time Syria Mosque could
be used.

' Mrs. Kohberger Dissents

Mrs. Kohberger, representing the
ofﬁce~of the dean of women, then
stated that this date would not be
feasible because 1947-48 activities
appointment must be made ear-
lier to allow time for the new in-
cumbents to become acquainted
with their duties. It was then sug-
gested that Tap' Day, the day
when these appointments are
made public, be restored to its
original date, May 9. This would
separate it from its traditional
place in festival events.

Outcome of the discussion was
that the Spring Festival commit-
tee was asked to consult with the
Dean of Men and the Dean of
Women to arrange ﬁnal plans.

for over a hundred years after its dis-
covery in 1791. But that is the story
of titanium, actually more abundant
than zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel
combined. One of the factors that have
kept titaniumfrom being better known
is the difﬁculty of handling some of its
compounds commercially.
If, as a student, you were to look up ’
, the equations for the manufacture of _

titanium oxide pigment, you might ﬁnd

something like this:

Fe'l‘iO3. nFe2O3* + (3n + 3)H,s04—> 'I‘i(SO4)g
+ F6304 + nFe2(S04)s + (3n + 3)H20

Fe2(S04)3 + 2H+ -—> zreso. + H2304 '
".[‘i(SO4)g + (x+2)HgO—) Ti02 .xI-I30 + 2HgS04

TiOg .xHg0-+TiOg + xHgO

*—The exact composition of ilmenite
<4 varies with the source of the. ore.

‘ . From these equations, the manufac-
ture of the “whitest of White?’ pigments
from black ilmenite ore appears to be
chemically simple and straightforward.
However, the processing required to
obtain industrial titanium oxide of
siifﬁcient brightness, hiding power and
ﬁneness is more complicated than one

/. would anticipate.

Needs Texts

For Freshmen  

The shortage of new texts has
become serious, according to

spokesmen for the Men’s Council"

book exchange, operating on the
eighth floor in the band library
room.

Tom Leiper, chairman of the
service, said that the ‘demand for
all freshman books is large. Writ-
er’s Guide, Hi-ck’s Short American
History, and Hart's College Math-
ematics are very scarce.

The six—man committee will
continue its work until Feb. 28
although the ﬁnal two days will
be utilized in returning unsold

books and making .,payments for

sold volumes. .

Total sales this term are ex-

Hearst Oratory Contest I  
Brings National 'F inals Here

W. S. Tacey, instructor in speech and Pitt chairman of the
Hearst Oratorical contest, announced today the rules of the con-
test which will bring to Pittsburgh in late spring outstanding ora-

‘tors from every major college in the United States. In the annual

contest, ﬁve students from local campuses will win a total of $500.
The subject is Patrick Henry, Patriot and Orator.
Contestants must comply with the following rules:

1. Be an undergraduate in any¢

school.
2. Deliver a six—minute speech
about Patrick Henry.

3. Use no notes.

3. Be original. , .

6. Consider thought, composition,
and delivery. Delivery will
count 50% in the judging.

Previously, the winners of the

Mid-Western eliminations in Chi-

cago met in New York, but this

year the national elimination
among zone winners will be. held
in Pittsburgh. Time, date, and
place will be decided later.

Mr. Tacey urges students to

partictipate _Who are particularly

-adept in the ﬁelds of history, Eng-
lish, and speech. Says Mr. Tacey,
(‘The Hearst newspapers have
honored Pittsburgh by selecting

 our city as the place fcr the na-

tional ﬁnals. It is our hope that
a7 local student will -represent
Pittsburgh in these ﬁnals.”
Entrants may ‘leave their names

Workmaster

New Vet Head

Stuart Workmaster, 'vice-pres-
ident, will succeed John Grimes
as president of the Pitt ".7eteran’s
association until formal elections
in June. In addition to this new
responsibility, Workmaster is the
publicity manager for the Pitt
Panther and Owl.

Grimes held the presidential
post for two consecutive ‘years,
and he believes “the organization
needs spark to give it a new life
and a new man in the president’s
office would help.”

By no means a stranger around
the campus, Workmaster is well
remembered for his work on the
Vet’s Review as director and writ-
er of the show. This year’s pro-
duction which tentatively will
be given by the Pitt Players in
conjunction -with the. Veterans, is
another musical comedy “How
Now.” Workmaster wrote the book
and lyrics for the songs. Henry
Bloom helped with the music.

It was largely through Grimes’
efforts that the Vet’s association

progressed. Despite outside opposi-
tion, he held the organization to-
gether, and put through to a suc-
cessful completion varior projects

will be entitled to a special chance
to wear off the rusty spots in their
ﬂoor game this spring.\

.Dr. H. C. Carlson, the amiable
Panther basketball coach, has an-

'‘ nounced that following. the close

of the 1947 hoop season on March
1, practice sessions will be inaug-
urated for the new ex—GI students.
Any student who has entered
school before March 1, 1947, will
be eligible for varsity basketball
during the 1947-48 season.
These early sessions will be

' held at the Pitt ‘pavilion for two

Weeks or more, beginning March
3. Practices will be staged on Mon-
days, Tuesdays, Thursdays, ‘and

Fridays, 4-5:31) p. m. They will be

carried on u_nde-r the watchful
eye of Dr. Carlson and Bobby Art-

, man, his assistant.

Swimmers Seek Third
sWin; Meet Penn State

  

Knoll and Young
Pace Lion Squad -

Seeking their third win in four
starts, the Pitt mermen travel to
Penn State to meet the Nittany
Lions in a dual meet tomorrow
afternoon.

The Staters are paced by Don
Knoll in the long free—style events
and R-odney Young in diving, but
the Panthers will offer strong
competition in vieing for ﬁrst-
place honors, especially Bill Coch-
ran, Panther diver, will be a po-
tent threat. Mike Levine and Ed
Bruener have been steadily im-
proving in the 220- and 44:0-yard
distances, with past perf-orumances
that match those of Knoll, Lion
mainstay,

“Prospects of winning at State
look good,” states Howard Waite,
swim coach. The Panthers remain
strong in the 50- and 100-yard free
style and back stroke. Paul Brug-
ger, Don Wilde and Walt Jackson
have shown great improvement in
the shorter free style events and
should provide the needed points

Milligan Takes Over Panthers

New Head Plans To Employ

Who said policemen ' and

football don’t mix?

But this time the angle is a little different. Instead of the

kind of bobbie that herds the

crowds into the stadium and

play, this one will direét the play-

The man in question is amiable Mike Milligan. The new
Pitt grid wmentor spent his summers as a member of the Ali-

quippa Police department. Next¢
fall when the Panthers go into
action, Mike will make good use
of his experience. The lesson that
he has to offer his men is under-
standing, for he has gained a good
perspec-tive on ‘all kinds of peo-
ple and their reaction. to all kinds
of situations.

Agrees With Fesler
Mike will take up where Wes
."‘esler left oﬁ, using the same
overall gridiron policies without
any radical changes. “Wes and I

think along‘ the same lines, and
although’ we may change our of-
fensive tactics a little, the system
will be virtually the same,” Coach
Milligan reports.

. The loss of Jack Durishan, Mar-
ty Rosepink, George Ranii, and
“Clip” Clougherty will b. felt, he
adds, but the return of J mmy Joe

Matteo, and Jim Maloney makes
the scene a little brighter. Mike

members of last year’s squad who
will be out for spring practice on
March 17. “We can develop their
personality,” he says, “but we
can’t develop the heart that those
boys havej’
Elated Over New Job
As for his feelings about his
new position, Mike admit’ that it
is one of the happiest things that
has ever happened to him. His
keen interest in the University
and its wonderful traditions make
it an honor for him to coach the
Blue -and Gold. 
Mike has 5. message for Pitt-
ites-—“It is a. pleasure to be your
coach. If we all get together and
work like fury, we’ll get what
we want. It isn’t possible to
have a. good Pitt team. Without
that wonderful student body
support.”

Titans and Panthers

The district’s third ranking team—\Vestminster——opposes
the Panthers tomorrow night at Farrell.

Win Eight Straight

Since upsetting Pitt, Westmins-
ter has won eight straight. Their
season record is seventeen wins
and two losses. The Carlsonmen
have copped ﬁve’ and lost three,
bringing their season’s total to
seven wins and nine losses.

Westminster a v e r a 5 e s 65.8
points per game while the Pan-
thers have a modest 45.7 average.
Howeverthere has been a differ-

ence in the caliber of the opposi-

tion. V

In smooth ﬂoorman Chet Dem-
binski the Titans boast the dis-
trict’s leading scorer. The six
foot, four-inch pivot man has
racked up 261 points in 18 con-
tests—-a hefty 14.5 average per
game.

David Leads Pitt

Pugnacious Bill BcLhinney, Ti-
tan forward, has tallied 215 mark-.
ers to rank ﬁfth among the district
scorers. Sam David tops the Carl-
sonmen with 160 tallies in 16
games.

Westminster now sports a four
game bulge in the series which
began in 1905, having won four-
teen and lost ten. Pitt r.eeds this
game and the following one
against West Virginia to ﬁnish the
season near the .500 mark.

With Canterna back in the line-
up and the Panther passing attack
clicking well it should be Pitt’s
turn for victory. ~

40/1. Qﬁeaa

A Pitt engineer who, for the
first time in many semesters here
has a few classes in the Cathed-
ral, ﬁnally got an opportunity to

observe Pitt.women and arrive at

a few rather interesting conclu-
sions. Alan C. Davis, senior me-
chanical engineer, submits the
following as the results of his in-

yestigations:

What’s the story behind°it, Ladies?
Where’d you learn such weird

ways to walk?

you carry yourselves

such unwomanly fashion

Why, in

That, Ladies, they’re starting to.

talk!
,They"re asking exactly what in
the world
Makes you slide and scrape and
scuffle,

As if trying to grind the soles off
your shoes.
Ladies, tempers are starting to
ruffle.”

They can’t see why one toe points

to the East,
While the other one heads due
North, .

And the rest of you can’t seem to
make up its mind
And, bewildered, sways back
and ‘forth.

They wonder why you weave your
mechanized hips,
As if ’twere your sworn plan
T9 steal the eyeballs out of the
head
Of some poor onlooking man_

Maybe Student congress caused it

all
With one of its far—famed laws;
Or maybe it’s one of these new
fangled fads;
Or is it just that we all have
our ﬂaws?

But, no matter what makes this
condition exist,

It would be nice if each girl

Should decide to carry herself
V like a queen.
Ladies, please give it a whirl!

Early Risers
To Discuss A
State Bonus

Pitt Breakfast Clubbers are
brave souls who heed their alarm
clocks on occasional Wednesdays
and drag themselves to the Red
Tuck shop- by the awful hour of
7:30 a. m. Next Wednesday, Feb.
26, if it’s cold, they will count on
the hot air generated by a lively
discussion of the state bonus for
veterans to warm them.

These breakfast clubbers aren’t

exclusive.» The only barrier you
hurdle to come and hear Fred
Hartenstein, lecturer in the School
of Business Administration, speak
on the bonus question is the
old. reluctance to get out of the

’sack.,John Grimes, president of

the Pitt Veterans association, will
be there to state his views in favor
of the bonus. After the speakers
ﬁnish there will be a general
discussion.

Some of the questions that will
be brought up in the discussion in-
clude: “Are you for a state bonus?
Who will pay for it‘? Who. will
beneﬁt by it and for how long?
What would large sums of pur-
chasing power put into circulation
at this time do to our hope of re-
covery from inﬂation‘? Who will
suffer by a state bonus?”

Here’s your chance to state your
opinion ,or to form one if you
haven’t decided about a state
bonus.
