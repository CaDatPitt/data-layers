That's lhe news folks, we're out of here

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s campus was backdrop to a full spec-
trum of emotions this past year as assaults
occurred, administration positions were
ﬁlled and the chancellor resigned.

The summer semester got off to a produc-
tive start as James Maher was appointed to
the position of senior vice chancellor on
July 1. By September the Department of
Public Safety appointed their first full-time
director since March 1993 -— the position
went to former head of public safety at
Michigan State University, Rick Boyd.
Also appointed was the new dean for the
law school, University of Iowa College of
Law professor Peter Shane.

On the other end of the employment line
was Chair of the National Surgical

Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Bernard
Fisher. He was fired in April and then
investigated by a congressional subcommit-
tee in July. Also investigated were Interim
NSABP Chair Dr. Ronald Haberman and
other Pitt officials.

In September, friends and family mem-
bers gathered at the Heinz Chapel to mourn
the death of two students killed in the Sept.
8 US Air flight 427. At the scene of the
crash were eight people from the Greater
Pittsburgh Critical Incidents Stress
Debriefing Team, coordinated through the

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. -

They were there to provide stress manage-
ment to other rescue officials.

The beginning of the fall semester
brought with it a new food court that
opened on the former site of the Tower A
cafeteria. Eddie’s food court contains a

Burger King, Baskin Robbins and Dunkin’
Donuts, along with serving stations offering
bagels, pizza, salad and a delicatessen.

But with the food service overhaul came
the highly unpopular BLOCK plan. Pitt res-
idents were required to buy food BLOCKS
in an effort by the Department of Food
Services to incur losses suffered the past
few years. The plan will continue next year,
with an increase in the cost of BLOCKS.

In‘ accordance with the Federal
Americans with Disabilities Act, Pitt imple-
mented further measures for the accommo-
dation of disabled students, faculty and staff
in the classrooms.

According to the Disability Resources
and Services Coordinator Marcie Roberts,
209 students received services through her
office as of November. The majority of

second-largest school, the
College of General Studies,
may be in for some changes.

Provost James Maher is cur-
rently reviewing a proposal
which would require most
CGS students to transfer to
one of the university’s other
schools after their sophomore
year.

The College of General
Studies was created in 1958 to
meet the needs of older, adult,
working and job-oriented non-
traditional students who prefer
evening courses.

A committee of deans
assembled by the provost has
submitted a report outlining
the history of CGS and sug-
gesting ways in which it could
revise its mission to better
serve its students and the uni-
versity.

“The provost’s office’s pri-

ends, i11 short, notduring the
traditional daytime classes,”
said Vice Provost Jack Daniel.

The committee found that
non—traditional students‘ are no
longer exclusive to CGS.

“Thirty-one percent of stu-
dents in CGS courses are not
from CGS,” said CGS Interim
Dean Robert Comfort.

Because of this shift in

enrollment patterns, the com-
mittee has recommended sev-
eral changes in CGS which
would enable the school to
better serve non—traditional
students. ‘

“We wanted to give students
several options,” Daniel said.
“If they wish, they can transfer
as full-time day students.
Students can also transfer to
another unit, but continue to
take courses at non-traditional

°CGS, page 9

One week and counting.

That’s right everyone, it
will all be over in a few
short ones and we will all
kick back, put up our feet
and let out a resounding
sigh.

Until then, break out the
Pepto Bismol and take a
deep breath because you
will be stressin’.

All students have expe-
rienced stress, whether it
is that biopsychologyrclass
or that 32-page paper you
have due in two days
which you haven’t yet
started, the anxieties of
knowing you will be grad-
uating in a week and will
be out in the real world or
maybe it is that significant
other who wasn’t all you
thought he or she was —- it

being a college student.
According to the
American College Health
Association, without some
stress, students would not
be able to get a lot done.
The extra burst of adrena-
line that helps you finish
your final paper or meet
any other challenge is
what is known as positive
stress. It is a short-term
physiological tensing and
added mental alertness
that stops when the chal-
lenge has been met,
enabling you to relax.

If you can’t return to a

relaxed state, this stress
becomes negative.
Although most students
accept stress as a neces-
sary evil they must cope

TEXAS — Wiley Koepp, a
senior at ‘the University of
Texas, in a bid to win the
position of president of the
Students’ Association, vowed
to free his two pet lobsters if
he won the election and to eat
them if he lost. His campaign
slogan became “Save the
Lobsters.” '

He lost. Koepp came in
fourth out of six candidates
for the position and kept his
promise, and along with his
campaign manager, boiled and
ate his pets. '

Thirty people showed up to
view Koepp keep his cam-
paign promise. Zoe and
Squishy, the lobsters in ques-
tion, were plunged to their
deaths with the sounds of
“Taps” playing softly in the
background. — The Chronicle

NEW YORK — City
University of New York’s
Hunter College student body,
faculty and staff protested
proposed cuts by the federal,
city and state governments in
education by staging a mock
burial for higher education.
Protesters cornered off a
section of sidewalk in front of
the university on which they
drew a chalk outline of the
“student body.” The crime
scene was protected from con-

tamination with yellow crime
scene tape.

Also littering the scene were
hundreds of gravestones
which were called the “Pataki
Burial Grounds, owned and
operated by Contract With
America, Inc.”

The name of the burial
grounds refers to New York
governor George Pataki and
the Republican agreement for
legislative change. —— The

FLORIDA — Two unidenti-
fied students were arrested at
Florida Atlantic University for
stealing four pounds of mer-

The stolen mercury was
accidentally spilled in the dor-

ing the 100 students who lived
in the dormitory to be evacu-
ated to a local hotel.

The university refused to
identify the students who stole
the mercury, but if they are
found guilty they could face
suspension or expulsion. --

Well this is it I guess. My last word. I start my
thanks to everyone who worked on this year's
paper. I don't want to single people out because
there were so many people involved, it wouldn't be
fair. It was, by far, the best year I have had here.
There are a few people I must thank though. Steve-
you and I have known each other for four years,
and it has been interesting to say the least. Jim-I
have had so many hysterical incidents with you,
I've lost count. I think the chemicals have affected
our brains after the time in the darkroom.
Christine-this was our year, and we did one hell of
a job. I learned so much about this place (and life in
general) from you that I can't imagine my life at
Pitt without you in it. And last but in no way least
my outside listening post-Jen. Thank you for
always being there for me. It may be over, but none
of us will never fall out of touch. Later dudes, W! 5

1st things 1st, special props go out to the news
section: John, Mark, Kathleen and all the writers.
You all should be damn proud because it was
one hell of a news section.Thanks also go out to
the graphics staff and the photogs. Without you
guys, our paper would look pretty damn dull.
We couldn't have done it without you. To the
editors: I think the one thing I won't miss from
this place will be sned meetings. To the other
members of the Fab Four: I know it's been an up
and down year but I'll never forget it or you. It
was because of you three that I got really
involved and learned to love The Pitt News. I
would say I'm going to miss you, but I better see
and talk to you enough that I don't. To the staff:
I'm going to miss this place and you. Stay loud
and stay proud.

UPMC sheds some light on treatment of AIDS

By Linda Wisniewski
Senior Staff Writer

Two recent discoveries made by
researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
have shed some light on the treatment
of AIDS.

“Our major objective is to learn more
about HIV and to help [the patients]
and to help us,” said'Dr. Charles
Rinaldo, principal investigator and pro-
fessor of pathology.

The findings, announced by Rinaldo
on Jan. 30 at the American Society for
Microbiology’s Second National
Conference on Human Retroviruses and
Related Infections in Washington, sug-
gest there may be natural defenses in
the body that keep certain people free
from AIDS for extended periods of time
after infection by HIV, the AIDS virus.

One of two studies monitored HIV-
infected people who have remained free
of AIDS for nine or more years.

“There were approximately 30
patients in the one study, and the other
one used normal donor cells and we
added the virus to those cells and tested
and looked how they interacted,” he
said.

“The infected people are men -
homosexual men — that are in our Pitt
men’s study,” said Rinaldo. “The men

have been enrolled in that for many
years — since l984.”

Researchers discovered that these
people have increased levels of immune
cells called memory cytotoxic T cells
(killer T cells.)

“There are different types of T cells
in the blood,” said Rinaldo. “There is
the CD—8 killer T cell and there is CD-
4, the helper T cell, which is the major
target for HIV, and actually gets killed
by the virus.

“Those numbers [CD-4] go down
over time, and this is one of the hall-
mark signs of you developing AIDS,”
he added. .

He said CD—4 cells are very important
to immunity. They are white blood
cells, and when they drop below a
count of 200 in the blood, along with
carrying the HIV virus, a person is
diagnosed as having AIDS.

' Rinaldo said the number of CD—8

cells goes up even when HIV-infected,
but their function goes down.

“We are more interested in how [CD-
8 cells] work,” he said. “We find evi-
dence they don’t work as well over
time. They lose their ability to respond
to the virus —- -the numbers are there,
but they’re not working as well.”

Rinaldo said that when researching
people with a terminal illness, there is
always the chance of some of the sub-

 

jects dying during the study.

“Half of our infected men have died,”
he said. “We’ve had to enroll additional
men who have become infected with
the virus to supplement the people that
either dropped out of the study or
died.” g

“If a patient has consented to an

autopsy, we do get autopsy tissues to .

further the study,” he said.

Rinaldo said the second study looked
at dendritic cells which are among the
first immune cells to confront viruses
when they enter the skin, mucous mem-
branes and blood.

“There’s a very small number of these
in the blood we have looked at,” he
said. “But they are very potent and they
really induce immunity.” -

Dendritic cells produce chemical
messengers called cytokines that are
known to change the behavior and num-
bers of other immune cells, possibly
even cytotoxic T cells.

“Once we learn how the output of
these cytokines varies with the extent
of HIV infection, we may be able to
alter their production to limit or eradi-
cate HIV,” said Smita Ghanekar, PhD.,
in the Feb. 9, 1995 issue of EXTRA, a

gpublication of the University of

Pittsburgh Medical Center. A1

However, Rinaldo said very little is

Hot dog wars wage on in front of Hillman Library

offers meatball sandwiches

Scott offers chicken and
beef kabobs as well as beef
smoked sausage and hot dogs.
Both sell beverages and chips.
The prices are very compara-
ble; a hot dog and soda from
Scott was $1.75 and $2.25 at
Dave’s. Food quality and
cleanliness are very high from
both vendors, so the real dif-
ference lies in your own tastes.

Scott Mancini, a 27-year-old
undergraduate said he has
been a patron of both vendors
but usually goes to Dave’s.
Mancini said he likes the hot
dogs there better because of
the taste and said buying from
vendors is ethnic and cultural
and is “natural in the city.”

On the other hand, Pitt grad-
uate student Brian Moriarty
said he patronizes Scott for the
chicken kabobs because they
are healthier for you than hot
dogs

The tension in the 30-foot
space between the two ven-
dors is secondary to the needs
of supply and demand.

Piwonski said he under-
stands what Scott has done,
and though he might not like
it, he has no choice but to sup-
port it in the name of business.

prise,” Piwonski said. “He has
as much right to this market as
I or anyone else does.”

ters were sent out on March 29. Donations will also be made for our
Scouting for Food Drive, on April 19. On March 12, Berger met with Larry
Bartlebaugh, Program Coordinator for the Center for Student Community
Service, to discuss plans for the Presidents’ Council meeting on March 17,
which Berger coordinated. The topic of discussion was the proposed cam-
pus wide community service project, which will now definitely be on
Saturday, October 7, 1995. It will be called ”The Big Event.” Plans indicate
participation of approximately 1500 students, staff, and faculty, who will be

lished SRFRS programs in the area. Callahan metwith James Mason, the
Student Supervisor for the Carnegie Mellon University Student Emergency
Services Program. Mason gave Callahan valuable insights into the applica-
tions and implimentations of the System. A rough draft of the proposal was
made and submitted to President Crowell, andis currently being examined
by Crowell for feasibility. Callahan attended the Food Services Committee
meeting last week with various Board members and other concerned stu-
dents. The overall focus on the meeting was the student support of the cur-
rent block system and their unhappiness with the proposed meal plan and

cling group made up of administrators from Facilities Management and
Housing. They discussed possible actions to take concerning the dilemma
of recycling. They are considering a Mug program in order to increase the
awareness of what Pitt actually recycles. Local vendors will be asked to pro-
vide incentives, such as discounts, to students when the commuter mug is
used. Currently, the design and the cost of the mugs are being considered.

Along with S.E.A.C., R.S.A., and C.W.O., Clouse has also been organizing

that 70% of the meals are eaten in retail operations. Six members of the
Board attended the Food Services Planning Committee meeting on March
23. Crowell along with Huey visited Florida State University to observe
their Student Run Escort System. They met with areas of concerning the
Escort System, including the Comptroller, the Insurance and Risk

GRE test switching  

over to computer

By Sandra Bennett
Staff Writer

By 1999, students taking
the Graduate Record
Examination to apply for
graduate school will no
longer need to remember to
bring a pencil to the test.
Instead, they will find
themselves sitting in front
of a computer terminal.

Officials at Educational
Testing Service, the compa-
ny that produces the GRE,
plan to completely comput-
erize the process within the
next few years. Applicants
will take the test on a com-
puter, except for the writing
section, which they will
still have the option of tak-
ing on paper.

GRE officials say the new
examination will make the
testing process more conve-
nient. Applicants will be
able to go to a GRE center
throughout the year, instead
of waiting for mass testing
dates.

“Examinees can test
at their convenience,’ said
Dawn Robinson, associate
program director of GRE.
“And with the computerized
test, scores are reported
much quicker, 10 to 15 days
as opposed to six weeks.”

The computerized test
was supposed to be fully
implemented by 1997,
but the date was recently
pushed back two years
after problems were discov-
ered. During trials with
the new test, some people
were able to memorize up
to 20 percent of the
questions. This made it pos-
sible to share information
with others who were
preparing for the test. GRE
officials said it will take
extra time to devise addi-
tional questions, so appli-
cants do not take the same
versions of the test.

Anne Rawlinson, assistant
to the provost, said the
delay is somewhat of a
relief. ‘

“It gives the schools time
to prepare for changes,”
Rawlinson said.

The current GRE has ver-
bal, quantitative and analyt-
ical reasoning sections. The
new test will have a differ-
ent format. Everyone will

be required to take verbal,
analytical and writing skill
sections. In addition. stu-
dents will also have to take
a quantitative or mathemat-
ical reasoning test.
Graduate school adminis-
trators will decide what test
package they want their
applicants to take.

“It sounds like it’s going
to be more efficient, and
it will be more tailored
to programs people are try-
ing to get into,” Rawlinson
said.

To get ready for the new
exams, admission commit-
tees at each graduate school
will have to learn to inter-

pret new scores and receive ‘

additional data on each
applicant. Schools will also
have to reprint brochures
and catalogs to reflect
changes in the admissions
requirements.

Choir showcases tour music Sunday

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

Heinz Chapel Choir will give the Pitt com-
munity a chance to hear the music they will
perform in their upcoming tour of south-
western Europe.

On Sunday, the Heinz Chapel Choir will

give their annual spring concert.
1‘ This year the music will have an American
theme. The reason for the American theme
is that the choir will be touring Greece and
Italy this coming summer.

“The ultimate goal of the choir is to visit
all countries represented with a nationality
room [in the Cathedral of Leaming,]” said
Director of the choir John Goldsmith, who
made the decision to tour Greece and Italy.

During the tour the choir will play music

I stemming from a variety of American

sources. ,

“During our tour we will play not only
music from the U.S. but we will also play
music with Canadian and Brazilian origins,”
said Goldsmith.

The choir, which makes a tour abroad
every three years, next plans to tour Spain,
Portugal and France in May of 1998.

The tours abroad are a very important part
of the choir’s attempt to present their music
to as large an audience as ‘possible, said
Jason Spiegelman, tour manager for the

choir.

“It is one of the goals of the choir to pre-
sent our music abroad. These tours proved
an excellent chance for the choir to reach an
audience that would not normally have an
opportunity to hear our music,” said
Spiegelman.

The choir presently has 60 members with
membership always kept close to 57 mem-
bers.

“We try to keep membership around 57 as
a reference to Heinz 57, it’s kind of an ongo-
ing joke” said Yarone Zober, publicity man-
ager for the choir.

The choir elects an officer board every
year. This year the board consists of
President Christine Furrnan, Vice President
Chris Marcello and Business Manager
Gregg Delcollo.

In addition to its annual spring concert the
choir also gives a Christmas concert every
December.

Auditions to join the choir are held every
semester, with an emphasis to audition in the
fall.

“The first three days of classes are our big
audition times, anyone wishing to try out for
the choir can sign up at the activities fair at
the beginning of the year,” said Goldsmith.

The spring concert will be held Sunday at
3 p.m. in the Heinz Chapel. Admission is
free.

those students were freshmen
and transfer students.

“What we’re finding is that
the more accessible we become,
the more we’re going to be
tapped into as an accessible
campus with accessible pro-
grams,” Roberts said.

The document “Toward the
21st Century” was passed by
the board of trustees, setting in
writing a list of short and long-
term goals for the university.
Among the goals is a plan to
increase the percentage of out-
of-state students applying to
Pitt.

Along the same lines, in set-
ting goals for the university, the
Master Space Plan was intro-
duced. The objective of the plan
is to establish a framework for
the structural development of
the campus over the next twen-
ty years.

In preparation for the coming
spring semester, the Student
Government Board held elec-

tions. Campaigns for the elec-
tion got off to a rocky start
when presidential candidate
Chris Fedeli was disqualified
for violating six articles in the
SGB election code. After all
ballots were counted Julie
Crowell emerged as the new
president, beating out candi-
dates Heath Golden and Dina
Scardamalia. A major issue in
this years’ election dealt with
student safety — on and off-
campus. -

Safety concerns were ampli-
fied with a brutal beating that
put a Pitt student in a coma last
January. David Orsborn, a
junior, was walking on the steps
outside the Towers when he
was beaten by five teenagers,
whom Pitt police suspected
were in a gang.

This came a few months after
Jeremy Starner, a Pitt fresh-
man, was hit by a brick in a
parking lot by Oakland Avenue.
An individual that came to the
aid of the student told The Pitt

Orsbom was beaten, Pitt Police
returned a sense of security to
Oakland when they made ﬁve
arrests in two days. The sus-
pects are currently awaiting
trial.

This past year, two alleged
sexual assaults became publi-
cized, one leading to the proba-
tion of three fraternities at Pitt.

In September, a student told
Pitt Police that while she was in
a bathroom at the Phi Gamma
Delta (FIJI) house involved in
consented sex with another
individual, the door was broken
down and a gang of males
allegedly sexually assaulted her.

As a result of that alleged
incident, FIJI and other fratemi—
ties Sigma Chi and Delta Tau

September, were put on social
probation. FIJI’s lasted the

Stress

°From page 1
with, especially during finals
week, there are some dangers
involved with stressing out
too much.

Stress can cause students
headaches, sleep difficulties,
fatigue, increase or decrease
in eating, trembling, nausea,
shortness of breath, not to
mention heart tremors.

The real problem, however,
is if left unattended these
problems will cause you fur-
ther stress by progressing
into bigger health problems
such as high blood pressure,
stomach ulcers and heart dis-
ease.

According to the American
College Health Association
studies suggest that your
stress level affects your
immune and nervous sys-
tems, heart function, metabo-
lism and hormone levels.

Take Pitt student Maria
Hamidi, who admits school
stresses her out all the time.

Although Hamidi realizes
that stress has been known to
cause a negative impact on
the immune system, making
one more susceptible to cold
and flu viruses, she can’t
seem to stop.

“Not having enough time in
the day to get things done
really stresses me out,”
Hamidi said. “Of course my
own actions contribute to
stress I feel because I pro-
crastinate. I’l1 feel a lot better
when finals are done.”

Procrastination, according
to the ACHA, is one of the
most common college stres-
sors.

Just ask Deanna Alko, a
self—admitted procrastinator
who knows no other way to
do her school work.

“You don’t get worked up
until the last possible minute
when you procrastinate,”
Alko said. “No sense in
working yourself up before
then and making yourself
stress longer.”

Stress, Alko admits, does
take its toll on her every once
in a while.

“Sometimes stress causes
me to blow up. I’ll eat more
than usual or sleep more than
usual,” Alko said.
“Sometimes I’ll brood or just
give evil looks, but it usually
doesn’t last very long.”

So, you know what stress is
and what it does to your sys-
tem, how do you keep your-
self from going ballistic and
having yourself committed
during finals west?

“Obviously, it is managing
your time,” Erin Rodgers,
GSA at the Student Health
Department. “They need to
adjust their outlook on the
situation and they need to
become healthier, which
includes diet and exercise.
Exercise is an incredible
stress reliever.”

According to Rodgers it
doesn’t matter what you do,
walking, running or aerobics,
if you want to alleviate
stress, exercise is the way to

During finals you should
try to eat regularly and sleep
every night, said Rodgers.
Eating regularly does not
include Baskins Robins and
Burger King, it includes
healthy eating.

“You only get out of your

‘ body what you put into it,”

said Rodgers. “You can’t
expect your body to perform
at a high level if you’re
putting junk in it.

Under the second option,

Daniel explained.

CGS students who want to
earn one of the five degrees
unique to CGS would remain

the CGS format is the creation
of a single s,et of degree
requirements. Currently differ-
ences exist between the gener-
al education requirements
needed to earn a CGS degree
and those needed to earn a
degree in other schools, such
as CAS, the College of
Business Administration, the
School ‘of Library and
Information Sciences and the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs.

CGS students have to com-
plete essentially the same
objectives as students in other
schools, they just go about
completing them in different
ways, Comfort said. For
example, CGS students are
required to complete nine
credits in writing and compo-
sition, but they are not
required to take the “W” class-
es that CAS students take.

“The differences, though not
significant, create perceptional
differences,” Comfort said.
The goal of the committee is
to have a single set of courses
with no cross-listing of cours-
es between schools. i

Another goal of the deans is
to strengthen the sense of fac-
ulty ownership in CGS cours-
es. Right now, one-third of the
courses in CGS are taught by
regular faculty. The remainder
of the courses are taught by
part-time faculty or graduate
students.

“CGS students deserve to
have access to the intellectual
heart of the university, which
is the faculty,” Comfort said.

Comfort noted that faculty
does not seem to have the
same level of commitment to
CGS as they do to other
schools. By having CGS stu-
dents transfer into the school
they wish to earn a degree
from, the committee hopes to
increase CGS students’ access
to full—time and tenured facul-
ty.
Comfort, who is a member
of the committee, agrees with
all of the recommendations
made to the provost, but
expresses concern about
whether or not CGS students
will lose their voice on cam-
pus.

“I want to make sure the stu-
dents are supported in every
respect as they are now,”
Comfort said. “I think it’s
important to retain a sense of
community and belonging for
students in CGS.”

CGS student council mem-
ber James Isaacs doubts that

the flexibility that should
result from these changes will
actually exist.

“Having a service sector
separate from the actual
school could create an identity
problem,” he said. “Students
may feel somewhat less
attached to any part of the uni-
versity.”

Another concern Isaacs has

is that encouraging students to .

transfer out of CGS would
make CGS seem like less of a
school.

“We can’t make CGS stu-
dents feel they’re something
less — like CGS is a junior
college,” Isaacs said. Isaacs
also worries that changes in
the CGS format could affect
the availability of evening
classes for CGS students.

Isaacs shares Comfort’s con-
cern regarding the loss of
community among CGS stu-
dents.

“I think the recommenda-
tions neglect the needs of stu-
dents,” Isaacs said.

 

I'l'l'

 

Isaacs stressed the impor-
tance of organizations, includ-
ing CGS student newspaper
The First Degree, an honor
society and several profession-
al societies to CGS students.
CGS also sponsors a graduate
dinner, an open house and a
children’s holiday party each
year, and Isaacs questions
whether or not the recommen-
dations of the deans would
affect the ability of CGS stu-
dents to organize.

The provost’s office is aware
of the concern for CGS stu-
dents and their sense of
belonging. Dean Comfort will
meet with the provost’s office
several times to iron out a
CGS identity and student orga-
nization concerns, Daniel said.

“The provost’s office is
going to do everything they
can to preserve the things
important to CGS students as
CGS students,” Daniel said.
“We share [CGS students’]
view that their needs are dif-
ferent from day students.”

were suspended for the remain-
der of the fall semester.

In February, another Pitt stu-
dent, 18, told police she was
sexually assaulted after leaving
an Oakland bar with a man she
had just met. The assault
allegedly took place in an apart-
ment on Ward Street in South
Oakland. Both Pitt Police and
Pittsburgh City Police are still
investigating.

The black cloud hanging over
the campus was made even
more prominent with the
alchohol—related death of a Pitt
student. Atif Bhatti, celebrating
his 21st birthday with friends at
a North Oakland bar, died two
days after drinking 16 shots of
whiskey in less than an hour.
The cause of his death was
attributed to chronic alcohol
overdose.

A little over a week later, Pitt
set up a task force to assess
alcohol abuse on campus. But,
according to Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs Leon Haley,

the task force was in its early
stages before Bhatti’s death.

Finally on April 10, in a state-
ment made at the Senate
Council meeting, Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor announced he
would resign at the end of the
1995-1996 school year or as
soon as a successor is named.

O’Connor’s announcement
came just a couple of weeks
after his decision to eliminate
the option of HealthAmerica as
an insurance carrier for Pitt fac-
ulty and staff.

Director of Communications
Ken Service said, “I think once
things settle down, people will
realize all the positive things
that happened under
[O’Connor.]”

When asked his opinion on
how the school year went,
Service said, “It was an eventful
year.”

“In general, the institution is
very strong,” Service said.
“Unfortunate things happened,
but a lot of positive things hap-
pened.”

going on for six years — I’d
say since 1989,” said
Rinaldo. “These are just the
latest findings.” 0

“Both of these findings are
leading us into very impor-
tant directions,” he said.
“They’re pieces to the puz-
zle, but it’s a large puzzle.”

Rinaldo said the next step
is to setup studies to test
new antiviral drugs that
seem to shut off the AIDS
virus to a certain extent.

“You’re going to need
drugs that will shut off the
virus and turn, on the cells,”
he said.

Robinson.

“Overall it sounds like

the process. But, standard-

make it worse,” said Chris

Affairs.

VERITAS, VIRTUS?

Veritas, Virtus--Truth, Virtue is the motto of the University of
Pittsburgh.

In recent weeks, Pitt has shown its true colors in the following ways:
OUnilaterally eliminating Health America as a health insurance provider for Pitt employees, despite a clear

mandate from faculty and staff that they wanted a choice in providers
OAnnouncing the elimination of approximately eight hundred (800) positions at the University of Pittsburgh

Medical Center over the next ﬁscal year.
OProposing the cuts of many University staff jobs from twelve to ten months, meaning for two months per

year employees would be without pay.
OContinuing the pay and beneﬁt increases for top administrators, while cutting other faculty and staff.

OCommitting unfair labor practices (including the ﬁring of workers for Union activity), as determined by the
National Labor Relations Board, against employees exercising their legally protected rights at the University. of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

In ongoing contract negotiations with District 1l99P of the Service Employees International
Union at Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, Pitt has displayed its virtue by attacking retirees. Not
only has Pitt demanded from District 1199P a wage freeze; cuts in bereavement, sick and vacation
leave; and elimination of the 1199 health insurance program; it has even demanded the termination of
the 1199 National Pension Fund, meaning that the thirty—seven 1199 retirees from WPIC would never

be eligible for another benefit increase. ~
Over the last three years, the "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

generated over $66 million in proﬁt, but they ’re unwilling to spend $17,000 to

preserve the pension of 1199P members at WPIC.’
District 1199P has represented health care workers at WPIC for over twenty years, establishing
the standard of living for Pittsburgh hospital workers.  

  Faced with UPMC’s assault on employees and retirees,
District 1199P members have chosen to fight.

AND YOU CAN T00! 

Help convert Pitt’s motto from mere words into a reality by:
1. Supporting the WPIC workers in their struggle against UPMC by
returning the note reprinted below to UPMC president Jeffrey Romoff, and Pitt

Sleep tight, ya morons!

This is the last paper for the year, and this is the last Sine
Nomen Editorial which is supposed to reveal the opinion of the
majority of the current editorial board. Since, however, the
majority of the editorial board has columns on these pages, this
space will be used for the following parting shots. There’s no
need to allow them to have their say this time, as they’ve been
using this space to put their two cents worth in all year.

While this was originally supposed to be a conglomeration of
parting shots from the balance of the editorial board, an issue or
two has come up which needs to be addressed in this paper.
Since it is not likely to happen elsewhere, here are a few para-
graphs to help put recent events, especially the Oklahoma City
bombing, in some kind of perspective.

When that bomb went off in the heartland of this country, it
was effectively a wake up call to America’s collective con-
sciousness. This is the second time terrorism like this has hap-
pened on our shores. While it is terrible to have such death and
destruction anywhere, this event reﬂects the fact that in the new
world disorder no one is as safe as they want to believe they
are.. 1

This morning, National Public Radio reported that there was
what appears to be another release of nerve gas on a Japanese
subway. So those who would say that the Asian social order is
so wonderful (a view has been put forth many times on this

8 page) are not correct in their analysis. Attempting to subjugate

the individual has not made the Asian countries any safer. Let’s
not look for other societal models to adopt to try and assuage
our fears. ,

If we are not to have a society based upon fear, then the
country must take this as our final wake-up call and stop hitting
the snooze button. Nothing exists in isolation, and if we don’t
begin to take definitive action now, the next time there will be a
mushroom cloud rising over some American city.

America needs to redefine its direction and role in the world.

~ Our government is currently caught in a reactionary trend

which is doing a terrible disservice not only to our present, but
also to our future. If there is any order to the new world situa-
tion and any perspective in which this terrible act of terrorism
can be placed, then the United States must do it.

Currently, there is no clue as to who did this or why, but
whether it is part of some jihad or a tax protest, this country
must realize that its security is in jeopardy. While there has
always been a threat to the country as a whole, for the first time
people are realizing that what can happen in Beruit can happen
in their own neighborhood.

What we are failing to realize, as a nation, is that the issues
are too complicated to deal with just by lifting the hood or sim-
plifying the tax system. This country has always been able to
rise to the occasion in the past, but we are slipping behind now.

If we choose not to wake up, then we get what we deserve. In

the words of the great Holden Caufield: ‘Sleep tight, ya~

morons!’

Learning where to walk in college

few more days. That’s
right, a few more days
and this boy is out of

here!

Am I excited? Yes, I think it
would be accurate to say I’m a
little anxious to get the hell out
of this place, but at the same
time, I can’t help but notice the
feelings, of sentimentality I
have had the past few weeks, as
things slowly come to a close.

Perhaps by reading this, you
will gain some insight that a
graduating senior has to offer
— or you could line the bottom
of the bird cage or kitty litter
box with it.

Either way you will be able
to use these words I’m about to
offer.

Let’s talk about doors at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Have you ever noticed that
almost every entrance to an edi-
fice (that’s a fancy word for
building ‘for you non-English
majors) at the ol’ University of
Pittsburgh has a set of doors
you can step through?

That’s SET — as in two
doors, not one.

Today, as soon as you finish
reading this column, walk in or
out of a door in any building,
(the William Pitt Union will
work), and notice what hap-
pens.

One person will go out
through one door, the person
who is coming in will wait for
that person to exit and then go
through the same open door
rather than opening the other
door and walking in.

This cycle continues, and
before you know it, there is a
large of line of students waiting
to enter and exit the one open
door

One would think that if you
were smart enough to make it
to college, you would also be
smart enough to know that both
doors can be used to enter and
exit a building.

Just a thought.

Another thing I would like to
talk about, walking on the right
side of the sidewalk.

Folks, don’t you think it
would be a hell of a lot easier if

everyone walked on their right
while traveling down the side-
walk to class? Now I’m not
suggesting that we all goose
step in a single file line down
the street, all I’m saying is keep
to the right a little.

It is bound to happen before
you graduate. You will be walk-
ing down the street thinking
whatever it is that preoccupied
college students think about
and you will accidently run into
some knumb-nut who is walk-
ing on the wrong side of the
sidewalk.

Folks, let me set the record
straight for you‘ todayand
remember this the rest of your
life because unlike some calcu-
lus derivative, this is one valu-
able thing you will learn in" col-
lege that you can use forever:

Walk on the right side of the
sidewalk — do you ever try dri-
ving on the left side of the
road? (If you have, just quit
reading this right now because
there is no hope for you any-
way.) Well the same applies to
walking, be courteous and
observe the unwritten rule of
proper sidewalk etiquette.

By the way, that whole spiel
is also relevant for walking up
and down steps in the Cathedral
of Learning.

Why should opening the
other door or walking on the
right side of the sidewalk mat-
ter to you, how will it help you
deal with the rest of your life
either here at Pitt or out in the
real world?

I’ll tell ya.

First off, think about why
others wait to go through the
open door rather than opening
one themselves, I’ll sum it up
for you in two words:

It’s easier — or — sheer lazi-
ness, (pick one, not both).

To open the other door takes
initiative, an effort on your part
to change the current sitpation.
If you choose to open the other
door, you’re not waiting for
someone else to proceed first,
you’re making headway for
yourself.

The same principles apply to
life. If you want to succeed

anywhere you are, whether it be
college or the real world, it’s
going to take initiative on your
part to make it. Your going to
have to open the door for your-
self, or get caught up in the
waiting game of life, waiting
for something to happen.

Walking on the right side of
the sidewalk just makes it faster
and easier for you and your fel-
low students to get to wherever
they are going faster without
causing major traffic jams.

It is the same in life.
Observing and following basic
social principles can make your
life and the life of others around
you that much easier.

That does not mean that you
should conform to what society
dictates. If you’re going to rebel
against something, make sure
it’s something worth rebelling
against. For the smaller, more
trivial issues in life, do yourself
and others a favor: observe the
basic social principle.

If you notice, I.took two
everyday things, opening doors
and walking on the sidewalk,
and turned them into lessons
that hopefully will be able to
help you during your lifetime.

That is the real key to suc-
ceeding in college.

One of the greatest things
about coming to college is the
fact that I learned so much
about myself and others.

Taking everyday situations
you encounter at college, such
as dealing with a difficult pro-
fessor, or working on a relation-
ship with another person, or
accepting the fact that not
everyone needs to feel like you
do on an issue is a big part of
growing up and preparing your-
self for the real world.

Forget about job training. Get
it into your heads, you came to
college to receive an education.
The sad thing is that most peo-
ple think learning ends when
you step outside the classroom.

That is when the real learning
begins. A

Editor in Chief qu

estions the tradi

fter working four years for The Pitt

ﬂews, I have learned a lot about the

niversity of Pittsburgh as well as

myself. I have learned about bureaucracy,

oﬂice politics, running a newspaper and some

acadenrics. What I couldn’t ﬁgure out was
what concrete traditions the university ms.

So as editor in chief, I set out to show stu-
dents what tradition we had at the university
as a theme of the orientation issue at the
beginning of the school year, since I wasn’t
really sure myself.

I knew about Lantem Night for freshman
women, “The Penn State Sucks” song stu-
dents chant at every football game as the band
plays the “Victory” song and Hand—in-Hand
— that was about it

What I fotmd was that no one could come
up with a concrete answer about tradition at
the university which the entire university
knows about. Different people came up with
numerous accomplishments, awards and
achievements, but not something that every-
one, including the students, participates in
each year.

I have concluded that the only way there
will be an entire university tradition on this
campus is if student groups or the adrriinistra-
tion start something, promote it and make it
consistent in the years to follow, or students
create their own personal traditions and ritu-

No one is consistent on this campus from
what I have seen. Homecoming Week in the
late ‘70s and early ‘80s used to be exciting
and ﬁlled with events for the students. It’s not
so exciting and extensive anymore. No com-
petitions, no parades, no spirit It hasn’t con-
tinued into the ‘9()s. Yes, times are changing,
but traditions shouldn’t

People may use the argument that these
events cost money. However, instead of hav-
ing a full-blown laser/ﬁreworks show, have a
smaller show and more events so more peo-
ple can come. This past year’s homecoming
was more exciting since there was an extra
event, Midnight Madness. It gave the students
more of a variety and different options of
events in which to get involved. And you
don’t need to have winning sports teams to do
these things — just some kind of campus
unity and university pride.

This past year, the Resident Student
Association and the Pitt Program Council had
the Bigelow Bash, an attempt at a spring ﬂing.
I have always been jealous of Carnegie
Mellon’s spring camival —— the amusement
rides, the good bands, the fun. The students
know this time is coming every year and they
can relax and enjoy the spring weather. Pitt’s
bash was good, but it needs to be more pro-
moted, spread out over a few days and deﬁ-

MI}

nitely more extensive.

I thought this year’s Dance Marathon was
going to be a good thing for students, not
involved in the fund-raising aspect of the
event, who wanted to hear bands and dance.
It’s a good cause and a good thing to raise
money for, but the students who came in off
the street to hear a local band had no room to
dance and see the bands up close.

Students like these types of things. They
like to have fun. I think the university and stu-
dent governance groups need to take that into
consideration and create events for students
carnpus—wide. They need to expand events on
campus and make known that these things are
becoming traditions on campus. These things
students will take away with them when they
leave the university.

If student groups do not take the initiative to
add a little stress—free fun on this campus, then
students should take the initiative to make
their own traditions. There is a whole city in
which to do that

I have made my own personal traditions at
the university. These are special things I do
with friends, and I am going to miss them
when I leave the university.

Visits to Dave and Andy’s for any ﬂavor of
ice cream have become quite frequent over
these past four years. As have visits to the “O”
at 2 am. for fries and Uncle Sarn’s for subs.

(Food seemstohavea1ottodowithmytradi-
tions.)

Going to the Luna on Saturday nights for
‘80s music has become a tradition during the
past year. Testing different beers has been
another tradition. Everywhere we go, we have
to buy new beers to try. I have tried chocolate
beer, peach beer, apple honey ale, etc.

Roadtrips have been another big thing.
During the past year, I have roadtripped to
Syracuse twice, New York City, Minneapolis
to visit the Mall of America and Charlotte
over spring break. The spring break trip
stemmed the tradition of all-night driving with
Twinkies and pop tarts, and collecting news-
papers from every stop and shot glasses from
every state.

A weekend tradition has been people crash-
ing on my couch for the past two years. That
has added a lot of fun, late nights and ‘70s
music infomercials. TBS weepy datenight
movies without dates, the Star Wars trilogy
and Grease have been watched over and over.

These are just a few things that have given
me a lot of great memoriesand fun times. I’ve
taken it upon myself to go out into Pittsburgh
and create traditions of my own, and those are
things that have added to my university
career.

tions at Pitt  What else is new?

Pulse, guidelines and goodbyes, thanks but no thanks

use it. I’ve been at The Pitt News four years, and I
' it’s time I get some things off my chest. After all,
this is the last issue I will be involved with.

The best place to start is with the biggest misconception
of this paper.The Pitt News is not a bunch of closed-off sep-
aratists who shun newcomers. I know there are people out
there who think this, and I want to set the record straight.

I ﬁnd it amazing that people come up here and ask,
“What are the qualiﬁcations for working here?”

I think former SGB President Ross Pasquale said it best:
“It appears that the requirement for writing for the news
section of The Pitt News is a pulse.” Yep. That’s just about

I ldon’t like the word goodbye, so I’m going to try not to

right, Ross.

We don’t turn people away. If you have a brain and are
persistent, then we’d love to have you on the staff. Trust
me, it’s not like we have an abundance of staff members up
here. We always need people.

Persistence is key. If you really want to work here, you
have to just come up and bug someone until they ﬁnd
something for you to do. You may think you are being a
pain in the butt, but it’s the only way you will get through
to an editor.

All of the editors are at the oﬂice about 40 hours a week,
have full class loads and some even have other jobs. We
are not around here all the time to be able to call people
back who want to work here. If you sit back and wait for us
to call you, then you are going to miss out.

Another misconception about The Pitt News is that we
have it in for certain student groups. ‘

Wrong. .

We report news. If someone does something bad, we

report it. If someone does something good, we try to report
it. It is easier to report the bad than the good, the reason
being we "usually hear about the bad things faster and easier
than the good. We don’t usually hear about the good things
unless we get a press release or someone calls us.

We don’t target any group for any reason. We simply try
our best to report the news. I think we do a pretty damn
good job of it, too. We are an award-winning newspaper.
Not that awards mean the world, but it’s pretty good to win
one. We won the Silver Crown award last year which
means we were one of the top college newspapers in the
country. The paper has gotten a lot better this year, and I
think we are in the Golden Crown category. Yes, mistakes
do happen, but overall this is a very good college paper.

Which brings me to another point about The Pitt News.
There has been a lot of talk this year about guidelines. This
point came up when two photos we wanted to run with a
film review were refused by our printer. To this day, I stand
by our decision to run the photos.

Anyway, written guidelines for any newspaper simply do
not workThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette does not have writ-
ten guidelines, and The Pitt News really is no different.
The editors use their individual (and group) values and
judgements to make decisions. If we make a mistake, the
editors take responsibility. Once people start talking about
guidelines, they are limiting our right to free speech. As
much as people deny that is the case, it is a step toward
censorship.

So Dr. Leon Haley and Pitt’s brilliant Student
Govemment Board won’t get their guidelines, and I hate to
tell them there really is nothing they can do about it. I stand
by the record of this paper, and resent any suggestion that

we are in need of guidelines. Thanks for the suggestion, but
I’ll pass.

Sony I digress for a moment, but I had to get that out.

I’ve had so many amazing experiences working here I
wouldn’t be able to ﬁt them all in my given space. I could
write a book about all people I’ve met here and the events
that have taken place. Most of the stories are not ﬁt for print
and I don’t want to bore anyone.

I had my ﬁrst assignment from The Pitt News before I
went to a single class at Pitt. Over the years, I’ve missed
hundreds of classes because of this place.

The people I’ve met here have been interesting to say the

least. Putting all of their names here really wouldn’t convey
the intense emotions I have for them.

The Pitt News has been my life since I was a freshman.
Sad, isn’t it? Not really. I wouldn’t trade my four years here
for any other school in the world. I

I’m starting to get sappy, so I’ll stop now. It’s hard to put
four years of your life into a single column.

I am going to miss this place and all the people here, but
I have many fond memories. All the late nights, the road
trips, the sporting events, the candy, the goofing around and
the screw-ups no one outside this office even noticed. Most
of all I am going to miss the people. I am conﬁdent The Pitt
News will carry on easily without me around. I’m going to
have a hard time ﬁguring out what to do without The Pitt
News in my life.

It’s been a great four years and now it’s over. I’ve gotten
more out of this place in four years than I could have every
hoped for. It’s more than I ever expected.

Matt Serlin is the managing editor for The Pitt News and
still doesn't know who shot JR.

News editor spits up what Pitt has fed him for four years

bandon all hope ye
who enter here.” That
has absolutely nothing

to do with my column, but it’s
one of my favorite lines of lit-
erature, and I always wanted to
be responsible for it being in
print again.

I’ve been trying to think of a
unifying theme that I can apply
to this column, but I just can’t
concentrate. (Proof of my
membership in the MTV
Generation?) So, I’m just
going to rattle off some obser-
vations. Anyway, I’ve got to
get this done soon, because
“The Simpsons” is on in an
hour, and I hate it when I miss
“The Simpsons” — that Oh 80
satirical look at the American
family. So off we go, try to
keep up.

A: You know, Pitt isn’t such
a bad place. We’ve got a little
bit of everything in Oakland,
and opportunities are every-
where. The tuition isn’t too
overwhelming, and we’ve got
one of the best student news-
papers in the country. (I had to
get the props in. Besides, it’s
true.) Pitt has certainly had
enough bad luck over the past
year, so I am not going to harp
on that. In fact it’s had some
good things happen. There was
that Master Space Plan thing,
it was kind of cool. Somebody
told me that this is great thing
for Pitt. I really doubt that. I
could give you a plan of what I
am going to study over the
next week. Whether or not I
follow up on that plan is
another story. I really hope that

Pitt can improve its reputation
with students and faculty,
because a successful school
has happy students and teach-
ers.

B: Get started on your career
as early as possible. I know a
lot of people are into that “you
don’t have to major in what
your career will be.” That’s
bull. I’m pissed at a lot of peo-
ple right now because they told
me to explore different courses
to see what I like. Hey, the job
market is tough and they don’t
take people who’ve only been
in their major for a year and
have no related experience. It
sounds pessimistic because it’s
true. The job market sucks
right now. And that’s not just
me bitching because I haven’t
found a job. I at least have

confidence in myself and some
related experience. So, get pre-
pared. Pick something you
have an interest in, and go with
it early. Then, if you don’t like
your future job, you’ll at least
have a job to pay the bills so
you can go back to school for
another career.

C: Visit the Carnegie
Museum. Every Pitt student
has a chance to go FOR FREE
to one of the world’s greatest
museums, and it’s within walk-
ing distance. Get some culture
in you.

D: For those of you not into
the Carnegie, go someplace
else. There’s a lot of stuff to do
in Pittsburgh. If you don’t have
a car, take the bus, or call a cab
and split the fare. Actually,
somebody should lobby for

Pitt to have a car rental agency.
Yeah, you would have to pay
higher prices because most of
us are under 25, but it would
be great. You'd be able to rent
a car out for the weekend or
use it to drive to an interview.
Think about it.

E: Get involved in your uni-
versity. I had some great times
at Pitt working as a Mentor
and.Freshmen Studies TA. I
know it’s difficult for some
because of work or living at
home. But I have found that
people have a tendency to
waste a lot of time, and it
could be used for some fun
and learning.

F: Quick question: Did
Vanna White and Pat Sajak
ever sleep together? I’m dying

Differing approaches to resolving America's we/fare crisis
End Ihe some old song and dance

"'5 not iusi the economy, stupid

ne of the most interesting debates
Om the current political discourse

is on what aspect of the American
scene should be focused on to solve the
nation’s ills — economics or the decline
in the country’s morals. Of course, fol-
lowing President Clinton’s “it’s the econ-
omy, stupid” lead, most Democrats (Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a rare excep-
tion) have chosen to focus on economics.
This should come as no surprise, since
these are the very same politicians who
continue to defend the Great Society cre-
ation of the welfare plantation in spite of
all of the deleterious affects that have
occurred in our inner cities because of it.

While there is no doubt that our
nation’s urban areas have real economic
problems, simply crying racism or saying
that minorities don’t have economic
opportunity doesn’t cut it. Neither does
the view that wages of the working class
have been stagnant for the past decade.
The simple fact is that all races and
social classes have been making eco-
nomic strides since the 1950s. According
to Thomas Sowell, a black economist at
the Hoover Institution, between 1950 and
1990 the black population doubled, but
the number of black white-collar workers
increased ninefold. In addition, the ratio
of affluent blacks (deﬁned as those eam-
ing $50,000 or more) went from one in
17 in 1967 to one in seven in 1989.

These economic gains have occurred
across the social class spectrum. During
the 1980s, earnings of American families
in every income bracket increased. A
recent report in the USA Today..(3/27/95)
showed that earnings for those in the bot-
tom fifth of the income scale rose 11.9
percent, 11 percent for those in the sec-
ond quintile, 12.6 percent for those in the
third, 14.2 percent in the fourth and 22.1
percent for those in the top ﬁfth. It is dis-
turbing to realize that as incomes rose,
the morality of the nation has continued
to decline.

I would assert that the United States
doesn’t have a problem of a poverty of
economics, but rather a poverty of the
spirit. When I say “spirit,” I don’t mean
only that of a religious sense. I think that
the nation should focus mostly on the
social degradation that began in the radi-
cal 19603. For the past three decades this
plague has warped the values of our
nation beyond recognition. I believe that
this has manifested itself in three ways
—— claiming of one’s “civil rights” while
neglecting personal responsibility, a
national loss of the feelingof shame no
matter how disgusting the act and the
breakdown of the family structure.

Since the mid-1960s, the attitude of far
too many Americans has been exactly

the opposite. Nowadays, a significant
number of Americans believe that it is
their birthright to burn their livelihood off
the labor of others. There is no better
example of this than the welfare system.
What was originally meant to provide a
hand—up, has become a $5 trillion hand-
out. This is also where the changing con-
cept of shame comes into play. In the
past people were ashamed to accept help
from the government; now, in many fam-
ilies, welfare has become a multi—genera—
tional support system. In addition,
because of the 1991 American with
“Disabilities” Act, drug addicts and alco-
holics are eligible to receive SSI pay-
ments. For most Americans, the sense of
shame has radically changed. For others
it has disappeared altogether.

Just as disturbing is the large number
of Americans who accept the crazy
notion that the urban “poor” are acting
rationally and naturally when they
become involved in drug dealing, gangs,
violence and dropping out of school.
What these apologists refuse to admit is
that there are also many poor whites in
Appalachia who are not engaging in
these sorts of activities. This behavior
has far less to do with one’s economic
situation than it does with one’s value
system.

Which brings us to family structure. In
the America of the 1990s, 40 percent of
children live in single-parent families
where fathers are absent. In many of our
major cities, the ratio is 80 percent. It is
extremely important for children to have
both parents in their lives; and for boys it
‘is crucial to have a man in their lives.
This near total collapse of the family
structure in urban America has had many
devastating consequences, both psycho-
logical and economic.

This is why, despite affirmative action,
in the 1990s a smaller proportion of
young black males are employed in the
workforce than was the case in the
1960s. According to liberal social critic
William A. Henry III, despair is also one
of the reasons that most universities have
trouble meeting their quotas for black
males, even while lowering their admis-
sions standards. This is not the case,
however, with young black women. This
is not due to economic deprivation, it is
sociological in nature. Currently, 68 per-
cent of black children are raised in sin-
g1e—parent families, most often headed by
the mother. The results, as we see daily,
are disastrous.

In the debate over how to solve
America’s social ills, we need to focus on
morality more, and economics less.

Pitt News.

hy do I think we’re seeing
the same old song—and-dance
routine when it comes to

welfare reform?

About two—and-a-half years ago, I
received a copy of a book called “The
Tragedy of American Compassion,” written
by Marvin Olasky, a journalism professor at
the University of Texas at Austin and dedi-
cated conservative. The chief premise of the
book is that the welfare system as we know
it is wasteful and actually harms the people
it wants to help.

His solution? An expansion of private
charities, the way it was supposedly done
before the so—called “Great Society” of the
1960s. Indeed, Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich borrowed heavily from the book
to formulate a large chunk of the
Republican “Contract with America.”
However, upon reading the book, I discov-
ered a serious lack of understanding as to
what the real issues confronting the poor
are.
I should know. I’ve been there.

At this time 11 years ago, I was on wel-
fare. I was out of school, unemployed and
without current prospects for either school
or work I can’t tell you how ashamed I was
to have to cany that photo ID and the blue
medical assistance card with me; indeed,
only my family knew about it. When I did
get a job, I excitedly shared the news with
my caseworker. I was only making mini-
mum wage as a bagger at a nearby Giant
Eagle, but hey, it was better than nothing.

I tell that story to dispel one prevalent
myth in the welfare debate; that is, people
on welfare don’t want to work and would
rather stay in the system. In fact, many of
them do work, but as they generally make
only minimum wage, they still qualify for
beneﬁts. In many cases (and this is especial-
ly true in mother-only households), the pro-
hibitive costs of day care and nonexistence
of health care make economic and social
nonsense for welfare recipients to get a job
in the ﬁrst place. Welfare isn’t the problem
— poverty is.

Contrary to popular conservative opinion,
the problems with welfare didn’t begin in
the 1960s with the expansion of federal pro-
grams. They really started during the period
immediately following World War 11. At
this time, people with means left the cities
for the greener pastures of suburbia began
buying houses, cars and appliances, in
many instances to compete with their
neighbors who were also buying everything
in sight. To feed their addiction to acquisi-
tion of goods, particularly the mindset of
“buy now, pay later,” the credit card was
invented, and the folks supposedly with
money have since mortgaged themselves to
the hilt In the ﬁve decades since, you also
have to notice that the well—to-do live in dif-

ferent areas than the less affluent

And that’s the problem.

So why can’t private charities take up the
slack necessary by cuts in welfare pro-
grams?'Three reasons:

1) People don’t give the way they used
to, in large part because, as I mentioned ear-
lier, they spend more on themselves. As a
result, such charities have themselves had to
rely on government handouts to do their
work. Many charities went under as a result
of budget cuts under Reagan, and those
who work with the ones that survived will
tell you that they’ve had to do more with
less. On the other hand, the most affluent
churches are often located in remote sub-
urbs where people without a car can’t get
to. As a result, they are often oblivious to
the suffering folks who never darken their
doors. One large local suburban charismatic
church just dedicated a new building —— but
couldn’t that money have been used in

g another fashion?

2) The pool of volunteers is drying up,
due to more women working outside the
home. How do you think such charities
were able to keep costs down? Ladies’ Aid
societies and other women’s groups are
having a hard time ﬁnding women with the
time or energy to give to relief efforts, espe-
cially considering child-rearing demands
they still may have.

3) Class considerations. Many
Americans prefer to blame the poor for
their poverty and don’t consider outside
forces out of their control. In a column I
wrote this fall,'I made a reference to unem-
ployed steelworkers crashing an Easter
Sunday service at my church. Now, they
were wrong to do that, but I understand
why they did. Right-wing ideologues talk
about “class envy” —— the poor being jeal-
ous of the rich —— but refuse to deal with the
way the rich have ripped off the poor, espe-
cially in the depression of real wages in the
last 20 years.

Olasky, in a recent interview published in
the Wichita Eagle, correctly noted that real

compassion is about suffering with the

poor. On the other hand, it’s hard for me to
imagine Newt Gingrich doing so, as he rep-
resents a suburban Atlanta district which, as
recently as 15 years ago, didn’t want the
city bus company to extend service out
there —— because it might bring an “undesir-
able” element.

And that’s the real tragedy of American
compassion —— it just doesn’t exist the way
it used to. We Americans have forgotten —-—
or never knew — what it was like not to
have anything and to have to depend on
other for basic necessities. Welfare reform,
therefore, isn’t a systemic problem; it’s a
relational one.

to know.

G: Take a ride on the Internet. And then get off it,
because it can be a huge waste of time. The Internet
is growing and can be a valuable research tool, but it
can also be a colossal waste of time. That’s right, I
said it’s a waste of time. Many home pages have
nothing on them. And the system can still be pretty
confusing to “newbies.” And I don’t feel like spend-
ing hours trying to figure out how to use it. Trust me,
I researched the Internet for a term paper this semes-
ter, and I was amazed at how much of nothing was
actually on there. I’m sure the Net users of the world
have already started a bulletin board about my timely
demise.

H: Take advantage of your rights. Call the chancel-

lor’s office and ask him why he resigned. Here you
have a chancellor who comes into the university and
promises to be open with the students and the media.
Has anybody heard from him in the past few weeks?
No. I know it’s a tough time, but come on and talk to
us, J .D. How would you like it if you were on a jour-
ney and the guide said, “Goodbye, I’m not your
guide anymore.” And then the guide gives no expla-
nation. (By the way, this is my opinion. So if our
chancellor is reading this, I hope he takes that into
consideration.)

Taking hold of your rights does not just mean call-
ing your chancellor either. Call your administrators.
Call our student governments. Call The Pitt News —
we are always looking for a story. Voice your con-
cerns. The people who work at this university are

working for you —- the students. Some don’t like to
believe that, but it’s true. If students are not happy,
then word gets around. To all you administrators out
there: Why do you think enrollment has dropped off?
Among some other small factors is one major reason
— Pitt is really developing a bad reputation among
the students. I love Pitt, but this school has made
some really bad decisions.

I: Make some friends. I did, and I’m going to miss
them. I’ve had some of the best times of my life at
Pitt. And there’s still time for some more, so I’ve got
to go.

David realization
Saliba that my four-

year degree
and prospective career is
worth but a mere penny in a
world of sporting millions.

On graduation day when I
receive my diploma, 1,
along with my parents, will
stare at that piece of paper
with a sense of accomplish-
ment, fulfillment and relief
that I am now finally edu-
cated.

Yes, on Sunday, April 30,
I will officially be profes-
sionally educated. And do
you what that means?

Nothing.

Well, nothing compared to
say, Scottie Thurman of
Arkansas or Gary Trent of
Ohio. Or how about Corliss
Williamson of Arkansas or
half of the Division I foot-
ball players?

The above-mentioned are
all underclassmen who have
opted toforego their
remaining collegiate eligi-
bility to pursue professional
careers in their chosen
sport.

As I sit at my desk and
write this article, two years
older than most of these
players, they look. laugh
and mock at what an “edu-
cation” can do.

My B.A. may get me an
entry-level position for
$21,000. They’ll make that
in one game.

These phenomenal ball
players coming out of high
school enter college know-
ing that after a year or two,
it’s time to leave our world
of higher learning and make
millions. And this has left
students, teachers and pro-
fessionals bitter.

Take a philosophy profes-
sor with a Ph.D. At Pitt,
which is not unionized, he
will make maybe $30,000
depending on tenure. Then
take someone like Joe Smith
from Maryland who leaves
for the NBA after his
sophomore year. If drafted
in the top five, he will make
more than $35,000 per
GAME.

So weigh the two sides.
One is a certificate stating
your academic accomplish-

I’m sure that you’ve deter-
mined by now that this is the last
issue of the year. Therefore, as is
tradition here at The Pitt News,
we will provide for you a com-
prehensive summary of the year
in sports —— and oh, what a year
it was.

In general, the sports here have
left us dying for more —— unfor-
tunately it’s next year.

Case in point: football.

In coach Johnny Major’s
sophomore season of his second
tour of duty here at Pitt will be
seen as an improvement by
some, and as a failure by others

This was only the beginning.

The following week, Pitt
snapped a 10-game home losing
streak with a victory over the
lowly Ohio U. Bobcats 30-16.
Also snapped in the game was
Martin’s ankle, which would
controversially put him out the
rest of the season. However, in
stepped sophomore Billy West,
and his 26 carries for 226 yards.
He would go on to gain 1,358
yards on the year with a 123.5
yards a game average. West was
also named Big East Offensive
Player of the Year.

With its record at 1-1, Pitt
went on to lose its next six in a
row. They were pummelled by
Ohio State on ESPN (remember

because of the team’s 3-8 record.
But there is no doubt that there is
potential for a bowl bid next
year. _

The blue and gold opened up
their season at home versus 19th
ranked Texas. Fittingly, as Pitt
great Tony Dorsett was honored
at halftime on his induction into
the NFL Hall of Fame, running
back “Cutback” Curtis Martin
ran through a porous Longhorn
D for a whopping 251 yards on
28 carries. Kicker Dave Merrick
booted the longest field goal in
Pitt history, a 54-yarder. Junior
College transfer QB Sean
Fitzgerald completed 12 of 25
for 219 yards in his Division I
debut, including a 16-yard TD
pass to another juco transfer,
Mark Butler, with less than a
minute to go, to put Pitt down
30-28. Majors decided to go for
the tie, but Fitzgerald’s pass fell
to the turf, just out of Chad
Askew’s grasp.

.“hul1y-gully football” at the end
of the first half?), Boston
College, Syracuse and Virginia
Tech (a game that highlighted all
three quarterbacks being used,
and Pitt’s only TD being scored
by third-string signal-caller Pete
Gonzalez). The Panthers were
outscored 124-26 in those
games.

Tossed in there were two
excruciating and highly memo-
rable losses. The first was to
Louisville, in which Pitt led
going into the fourth, but was
marred by mistakes (namely two
fumbles by West and a 40-yard
pass from Fitzgerald to Billy
Davis that was dropped) which
let the Cardinals come back and
steal a 33-29 victory.

Next there was the
Homecoming game against West
Virginia, a game featuring 10
plays over 40 yards, two blocked
ﬁeld goals, one blocked punt and
two interceptions returned for

TDs. John Ryan replaced
Fitzgerald at QB and threw for
433 yards and four TDs, adding
accelerant to an already ﬁrey QB
controversy. Wide receiver
Dietrich Jells hauled down 225
receiving yards. However, it was
with 15 seconds left that WVU
wide receiver Zach Abraham
beat comerback Denorse Mosely
on a 60-yard pass route and
snared the Chad Johnston pass
for a touchdown, handing Pitt a
47-41 loss.

After the game Majors said,
“In 37 years of coaching, I have
seen about everything that I
could possibly see. Today, I saw
a game like I have never been
involved with in my life.”

Pitt was able to improve its
record to 2-7 with a 45-19 Victo-
ry over Temple. Panther
receivers stole the show, with
Davis having seven receptions
for 116 yards and two TDs,
Askew having eight catches for
138 yards and a TD and Jells
having two catches for 67 yards.

On a soggy Orange Bowl
field, the Panthers held their own

 

against ﬁfth-ranked Miami, tak-
ing a 17-12 defeat. Pitt had the
ball in Hurricane territory with
59 seconds left, but once again
was unable to pull out a late-
game victory, losing the ball on
downs.

The season ended on a good
note, with a 35-21 victory over
Rutgers. West had 30 rushes for
188 yards and a TD. Davis
ended the year with a 10 recep-
tion, 135 yard game along with
four TDs.

Not only do we have next year
and the hope that some of these
close games are pulled out in
crunch time, there will always be
‘96, since Majors has already
gotten two oral commitments
from local blue-chippers.

The women’s volleyball
team’s magic bus continued
down the same road it’s been on,
compiling a 21-11 overall record
and a 7-1 Big East record. They
won their seventh straight con-
ference title.

Going into the season, the
Lady Panthers were chosen to

Freshman
Davis plays
like a senior

By Rachel Lenzi
Staﬂ" Writer

Fran Davis is the lone freshman
on this year’s women’s tennis
team. Does that bother her?
Absolutely not

“It has been easy adjusting to the
college game because everyone on
my team has been really support-
ive,” she said. “Being the only
freshman, they help me out and
they really give me a lot of atten-
tion.”

The attention and help certainly
haven’t gone to waste. Right now
Davis is the No. 2 seed on a
women’s team that has notched 13
wins this season, the most ever for
a Pitt women’s tennis team.

The Dallas, Pa., native owes a
lot of credit to her parents, who

urged her to get into the game of

tennis at a young age.

“Both of my parents played ten-
nis, so I’ve just grown up around
it. I play against my parents, and
they’ve had me in tournaments
since I was young.” ‘

Davis was an all-around athlete
at Wyoming Seminary, a private
school in northeastern
Pennsylvania. She played tennis,
ﬁeld hockey, basketball and soft-
ball before deciding to ﬁilly devote
her time to tennis.

Her decision’ to attend Pitt was
made easily. After visiting the
campus on a recruiting weekend,
Davis was taken by the school and
the tennis program.

“Ihadalot offun during recruit-
ing weekend,” she said. “I loved
everyone on the team, I loved the
city of Pittsburgh and I really like
the coaches. George and Emma
are great”

From what Davis says, the tran-
sition to college tennis hasn’t been
too diﬁicult for her. However, she
notes a difference in the skill level
of college players, as compared to
high school players.

“The competition is a lot harder,
especially being ata Division I
school. Everyone I play is good,
whereas in high school everyone
on a team played, despite their skill
level.’’ I

Also, she notes that the players
in the collegiate game are more
serious about the sport, a quality
that she is developing. The level of
tennis in Davis’ first year is high.
She feels that she is becoming a
better player, as well as becoming
more serious about the game.

“Playing collegiate tennis is real-
ly a good experience, playing
against all these good players, and
this is what I need, to get a lot of
competition,” she said.

When asked about her style of
play, Davis characterized it as
“awkward.” But what she lacks in
grace, she makes up for it in inten-
sity.

“I’m aggressive. I hit hard. I
don’t like long matches, so I try to
put away points quickly, to get the
match over with.”

So far the college game has been
eventful for Davis. Against Robert
Morris, she played at the No. 1

Dieffenbach combines academics with game‘

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

For 24 years, George
Dieffenbach has been
involved with the University
of Pittsburgh as a student,
athlete, coach and professor.

He has coached men’s ten-
nis for the past 20 years, with
a 187-149 record, and

women’s tennis for the past

14 years, with a 113-100
record.

“The main benefit [of being
the coach] is seeing student
athletes getting confidence in
themselves. I see my student
athletes gain confidence in
themselves as they become
more competitive on the ten-

' nis courts,” said Dieffenbach.

“I’ve always believed that
becoming more competitive
as athletes will help them

become more competitive as.

As head coach, Dieffenbach

well as academics.

“Each team gets the mes-
sage that they have to do their
schoolwork and work hard on

the tennis court, and they will

achieve results. '
“They have to work hard,

and that’s true in their lives

after they leave school here,
and that’s what I think one of
the main purposes that we
have for the tennis program,”
he said. “lt’s not just tennis.
It’s not just school. I think it
tends to make people more
successful down the road.”

Pitt tennis player Brad
Wade agreed. He said
Dieffenbach is very encour-
aging toward academics. If a
player has a test, he will let
them take practice off so they
can study.

Dieffenbach said there have
only been a few of his ath-
letes who haven’t graduated
from the university.

win the Big East, but coach
Cindy Alvear felt it was up in the
air and any team could win it.

The team got off to a rocky
start, facing No. 1 ranked
Stanford in just their third match
of the season, which they lost in
three straight games.

Then, just two weeks after
playing top-ranked Stanford, Pitt
faced off against the No. 2 team,
Nebraska, which it lost in three
games.

These matches served as a
solid warm-up going into Big
East competition. With a 7-5
record going in, Pitt won five
straight conference matches,
mixed in with two non—confer-
ence losses before Connecticut
handed the Lady Panthers their
only Big East loss of the season.

The team took third place in
the Hardee’s Invitational, win-
ning the consolation game over
Virginia Tech.

From there it was on to the Big
East Tournament, where the
Lady Panthers took first, defeat-
_ing UConn 3-1 and Seton Hall 3-
2.

In the ﬁrst round of the NCAA
tournament, Pitt shocked Iowa,
defeating it 3-2 in several hard-
fought games. The second round
was a little different going up
against No. 12 Notre Dame. Pitt
lost 3-1.

The Lady Panthers’ road to an
eighth consecutive conference
title will be all uphill next year.
Notre Dame will most likely be
the roadblock, as it enters into
the Big East for the ﬁrst time.

After an early season goalie
controversy, the soccer team set-
tled on senior Kirk Brodows, and
he led them to a 9-8-1 record, 1-
6-1 in the conference.

“9—8—l isn’t what it could’ve
been,” said coach Joe Luxbacher.
“Looking back it was good, we
had some big wins. But in the
Big East we didn’t get it done.”

Eric Prex led the team with
eight goals and 11 assists, high-
lighted by the tying and game
winning goals against SUNY
Buffalo in the ﬁnal two minutes
of play.

The Panthers opened their sea-
son at home, defeating Bucknell
for the first time in three years.

After jumping out to a 3-0
record, the team ran into trouble
in their first Big East matchup
against Georgetown, the team
who ended up winning the con-
ference title. The Hoyas won the
game 3-2.

Pitt’s only Big East victory
came against Providence, 4-3 in
overtime on a goal by Dean
Astorino. He led the team in
garne- winning goals with three.

The Panthers managed to tie
Syracuse at home late in the sea-
son.

Next year the Big East will
just be stronger, as Rutgers joins
the conference, fresh off a Final
Four appearance last season.
This is not what the Panthers
want to hear. after losing five
four-year starters to graduation.

“We have some big holes to
fill,” said Luxbacher. “The group
coming back has to step it up a
notch.”

Go ahead, take a breather —
things are only getting warmed

up.

the half, the Panthers folded,
allowing the then No. 1 team to
come back and win 85-76.

The season closed at the Big
East tournament. After an open-
ing round victory over St. John’s,
Pitt fell three points short against
UConn, losing 81-78.

After losing seemingly every
game by ﬁve points or less (actu-
ally there were 10), everybody

to note that three of these losses
came against UConn, which
went 35-0 and won the national
championship. Pitt’s losses were
respectable at 100-67, 71-43 and
95-63, when UConn routinely
beat its opponents by more than
30.

Senior point -guard Carol
Morton had 178 assists and 99
steals on the season, on her way
to breaking the all-time steals
record at Pitt.

Jenine Joyce and Stephanie
Petho led the team in scoring

~witli 12.8 a game. Petho broke

20 for a game three times, with a
high of 29 against Georgetown,
25 against St. John’s and 20
against Providence. Joyce did

the same four times, with a high V

of 32 against Niagara.

Latia Howard was the leading
freshman on the team, coming in
and averaging 10.7 points a
game and eight rebounds.

The only point of controversy
was the team not being selected
for the National Invitational
Tournament at the end of the
season. .

Coach Rande Stottlemyer’s
wrestling squad had a huge year,
ﬁnishing the season ranked 21st
in the nation, with a 14-9 record,
3-3 in the Eastern Wrestling
League, while consistently grap-
pling against ranked opponents.

The Panthers beat Penn State
for the first time in 19 years by a
21-11 margin.

The team was led by 142- .

pounder J.J. Fasnacht, who went
33-6 on his way to earning All-

All-America honors was John
Winthrow, who was second on
the team with a record of 28-13.
Chad Jesko won EWL

The men’s swimming and

Chuck Knoles, the team had
many firsts.

They beat rival Penn State for
the ﬁrst time 122-121. The 800
meter freestyle relay team won
the the National Championship
at the U.S. Open, held at the Erie
Community College. And, the
team beat Virginia two years in a
row for the first time.

“The team’s got their feet well
founded in the philosophy of
where we need to go as a
Division 1 school,” said Knoles,
“We’re going to make a move
on a national leve .” '

They finished first in the
SUNY Buffalo Invite with a
score of 956, crushing the com-
petition. The second place fin-
isher was James Madison with
750.

Pitt’s bid for a second-straight,
and 12 of the last 13 Big East
titles was foiled by Miami. After
winning 130-114 at the begin-
ning of the season, the ‘Canes
were too much for the Panthers
to overcome in the Big East
Championships, as Pitt (675) fin-
ished third behind Miami
(679.5) and Syracuse (675.5).

Matt Brady closed out his
career at Pitt setting 10 school
records and one pool record in
his four years of work.

The women’s swimming and
diving team had more of a strug-
gle, going 4-8 on the season.

They finished third at the
SUNY Buffalo Invite. They also
third at the Big East
Championships with a 580.5
behind Villanova (595) and
Miami (583) with the final
standings coming down to the
ﬁnal race, the 400-yard freestyle
medley.

Diver Sunday Lewandowski
was named Big East Diver of the
Year. In the NCAA diving tour-
nament she was also named All-
American on the 3-meter and
received honorable mention after
placing 11th on the l—meter.

The women’s gymnastics
team ended their season with an
overall record of 6-19, making it
into the NCAA regional compe-
tition, where they finished sixth
out of seven teams.

The team’s best meet of the
season was by far the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference,
which Pitt hosted. The Lady

Panther’s 189.35 was a new

team record, and they placed
fourth out of seven teams com-

peting. Robyn Senior placed
third in the all-around with a
career-high score of 38.375. It
was also enough for second on
Pitt’s all-time list.

The men’s gymnastics team
gave head coach Frank D’Amico
his 18th consecutive winning
season with a record of 19-11.
D’Amico also reached the 200
career win plateau.

The team had a season-high
220.10 at the North Atlantic
Gymnastic Championships, tak-
ing first place over four other

‘ teams.

At the National Independent
Championships, Pitt placed
third, but sent six gymnasts to
the finals and qualified Keith
Youndt (parallel bars) and Karl
Chan (High Bar) for the NCAA
East Regionals.

Well, that’s it. Feel free to
exhale.

For those of you who feel that
Pitt athletics has let you down
this year —- listen to it again —
wait ‘til next year. Oh, some-
thing else — if you aren’t satis-
fied, you were watching the
wrong sports.

Cate stating your income of
over $30,000 per game for

Sure, not every athlete
makes it to the professional
level, but how many stu-
dents do you know drop out
of college?

Education is not the No.1
priority for these athletes
and it shouldn’t be. They
devote a few hard years to
the university in hopes of
increasing their stock for
the pros and the university
makes money off of them.
It’s an even trade.

But what about the Ralph
Willards of college basket-
ball?

When coaches signed top
high school prospects in the
past, the main concern was
of academic eligibility. Now
when a coach recruits a
player there is no certainty
that he will be able to build
a powerhouse in four years.

Take the University of
Michigan’s basketball team,
nicknamed the Fab Five.

Only two played out their
four years.

Universities have become
high dives into the deep end
of the almighty dollar for
these athletes, and they are
lining up to jump.

Since Michael Jordan left
North Carolina as a junior
and Marshall Faulk explod-
ed into the NFL from San
DiegoState as a junior, I
have kept track and watched
their careers, and wallets,
expand to great lengths,
leaving me with an insight-
ful point of view.

Leave college. If you’re a
junior or a talented sopho-
more, leave, go. Enter your
field of expertise. Whether .
it is biology, psychology, or
writing —- market yourself
and your talents, but you
need to do so soon. The
field of employment is
implementing an entry-level
salary cap.

ter’s and doctorate degree in
science education.

He has taught in a number
of public schools in the area
as well as one private school.
After receiving his doctorate
in 1988, he taught at Pitt. He
also serves on the Fox Chapel
School Board.

But for now, he is concen-
trating on coaching as well as
managing the Cost Center

and teaching tennis to Pitt’

students.

“We consider ourselves a
family in terms of our team.
We support one another, we
work hard in practice, we
play hard when we play
matches  we work together
toward a common goal which
is do well academically and
do well on the tennis court 
and to represent the universi-
ty well,” he said.

Dieffenbach’s biggest chal-
lenge has been getting out-
door tennis courts on campus,
since most of the teams’ away
matches are outdoor matches.

When he played for the uni-

’  """’i"1'h‘e Pitt News, 'l‘uesday, ‘Alp 6 iii 20, 1995

versity, before the Cost
Center was built, there were
seven outdoor regulation sur-
face courts with a giant wall
behind them, existing until
the mid—’80s. '

In 1988, the university
decided to build the Cost
Center, which wouldhouse
nine indoor courts, on top of
the outdoor courts. Then, they
installed four outdoor courts
where Sutherland Hall cafete-
ria is now located.

When Sutherland was built,
those courts were bulldozed,
and the team now goes to
Schenley Park for outdoor
practice.

“We need outdoor tennis
courts and that’s been the
main challenge we face since
we lost those outdoor courts.
It would really help us if we
could have some outdoor ten-
nis courts on the University
of Pittsburgh campus.”

However, Dieffenbach said
the university has been sup-
portive of the tennis teams.

“We’re trying to build a tra-
dition of winning tennis

teams,” he said. “We’ve
established a winning tradi-
tion.”

In Dieffenbach’s Pitt career,
he has either coached or
played in 20 non-losing sea-
sons and three losing seasons.

For two years straight the
men had placed last in the
Big East, but last year they
were able to defeat Villanova
and move out of last.

The women’s team has

always been in last place in
the Big East, but that could
change-this year. According
to Dieffenbach, the women
beat Villanova this year, the
first time they beat a Big East
team in a dual match. “These
[are the special] things I
remember [about my teams],”
he said. ‘
. “He is dedicated, he is very
serious and focused. He deals
with the players very well,”
said Emma Dieffenbach, his
wife and assistant women’s
tennis coach. “The one thing
that bothers him is control-
ling the athletes’ tempers on
the court.”

But she said he has that
under control. There are team
rules which all of the players
sign, because he doesn’t want
the players to throw fits on
the court, because it doesn’t
represent the team or the uni-
versity well.

“I think he’s a great coach,”
said Wade. “If you have prob-
lems, you can go talk to him.”

Wade said Dieffenbach
sometimes doesn’t push the
players as hard as he could.
“Sometimes he could be
tougher, but then he doesn’t
want to wear us out and wear
us into the ground,” he said.

When Dieffenbach isn’t on
the Pitt tennis courts, he is

‘playing tennis with his wife,

playing golf or teaching his
children how to play tennis.

He started to teach his 6-
year—old daughter when she
was three and his 3-year-old
son when he was one and a
half.

He said he doesn’t want to
pressure them into playing
tennis, but it is something
they really enjoy.

 

Davis

°From page 19
swd and won the match. She said
that her best match was against
Big East rival Villanova.

“It was an important match.
There was a lot of pressure playing
Villanova, but I was happy with
the outcome. Also, playing
Duquesne in the Pitt Invitational
was tough, because she was a
good player.” Davis won against
her opponent from Duquesne.

The Lady Panthers may possi-
bly face Villanova in this week-
end’s Big East Championships,
which may bring about a rematch
for Davis. She’s ready to go for the
weekend in Miami and hopes to

watches and faces.

“The girls who are playing are
going to be amazing,” Davis said
“Hopefully, I’m going to play
some good tennis there and watch
some good tennis as we 

No pressure indeed. ‘The Big
East Toumament means plenty of
tennis experience for the fresh-
man. Some of the players Davis
competes against now may be the
same ones who she may defeat in

future Big East Tournaments.

Th Nigaa Lve o Hte

Rolling Stone, MTV, Spin,

 and even you at The Source
 y’alls dis sounds like this: Fuck
 you, Eazy-E. lt’s louder than a
 bomb in tha hood. Although ya
 ain’t sayin’ it where we can read
 or see it in the pages of your
 mags and on the television, we
 hear ya tellin’ Eazy to fuck off.

By giving so little press to Eazy-
E (aka Eric Wright) following his
death, you’ve once again suc-
ceeded in promoting mall-art,
hegemony and a monocultural
take on music. lt’s not hard to
verify the subtle, yet tangible,
ideology permeating the post-
grunge press that would rather
portray Eazy-E as just another
dead nigger than legitimize his
position as an influential musi-
cian and inner-city success
story.

Tell me this: why is it when
Kurt commits suicide y’all had
his generational icon story pack-
aged, publicized and ready for
our consumption quicker" than
anyone could say, ‘‘I hate myself
and want to die?" Perhaps it's
more palatable to romanticize a
depressed white kid from the
suburbs than give props to an
anti-authoritarian who bellowed
“Fuck tha Police” to dumb
muthafuckas in blue uniforms.
The message sent here is that

scene with
zmeo

whiny white guys sell, so fuck
alienated art from the hood.

Only weeks ago, Spin plas-
tered Cobain’s picture on their
10-year retrospective issue. Yet
as of this moment, there’s been
no mention of Eazy’s death. And
compare Flo/ling Stone’s treat-
ment of Kurt and E. Within
weeks after Kurt’s suicide, which
was sentimentally spun “the day
the music died,” Rolling Stone
devoted an entire issue to
Cobain which all but canonized
Kurt as the voice of a genera-
tion. Thanks, but I’d like to
speak for myself. And ya can’t
forget about the commercializa-
tion and merchandising of
Cobain that followed which
pumped him up into a quasi-
myth: Unplugged in New York,
umpteen T-shirts and posters
and a Rolling Stone book that
came out just in time for
Christmas.

The post-Nirvana fall-out on
MTV was inexhaustive, with
weekend long tributes and
somber Kurt Loder news
updates on the hour (as it any-
thing was going to change, he
was deadl). And now a full year
after that, yet only weeks after
Eazy-E, y’all are still trippin’ over
last year’s news. And how much
recognition did Eazy-E get from
Rolling Stone? Check page 25

of the May 4th issue. Ya know,
the one with Tom Petty on the
cover and a glowing profile of
this “King of the Road.”
Booonng.

Flo//ing Stone’s obligatory trib-
ute to Eazy-E pales in compari-
son tothe coverage still being
handed to the Cobain institution.
It just doesn’t make sense that

for a man who established one s

of the most successful rap labels
“Ruthless Records,” and co-
founded the groundbreaking
West Coast rap group NWA
(whose Niggaz 4 Life hit number
one on the Billboard charts) and
is considered a pioneer in rap to
be dismissed with such a curso-
ry notice. Instead of offering
something approaching vibrant
discourse, or even a discussion
of Eazy’s cultural impact, all
these magazines, pundits and
critics seem to wanna talk about
is the number of women Eazy
might have slept with.

The media’s problem is this:
Eazy-E was black and especially
anti-suburban. He died of AIDS.
And whereas Kurt was married
and monogamous (right?), Eazy
had fathered seven children with
six different women. Eazy’s

complex image as a 9mm toting,’

bitch-slappin’, drug-dealer pimp
who supports the GOP is some-
thing the mainstream press
hasn’t wanted to tackle. Plain
and simple: this persona is a
threat to white America. Tipper
Gore wanted to censor him, the
police wanted his ass in the pen
and now the press is whitewash-
ing the dynamics surrounding
Eazy-E, gangsta rap and inner-
city politics.

All of which smacks of those
old “Untouchable” episodes
where the badass bad guys
always die at the hands of Eliot
Ness—type stifts. And just like E,
those episodes’ gangster char-
acters always had five times the
dynamic persona of Mr. Law and
Order. And just like on the show
we were privileged to watch a
powerful black make self-
empowering moves — but at the
expense of being killed off at the
end with smug justification from
the cops and press. What we’ve
got with the media and Eric
Wright is the same damn thing:
Eazy-E’s a nigga who had to
die. And we know that ain’t the
truth, Ftuth. Peace-out, E. We’ll
miss ya.

J’)?  /‘/‘cf/Em é// éoé /po//7e/z9//

Star heard a jackhammer pounded in
his dreams and shouts echoing down a
windy hallway. Jailhouse doors slammed
shut and a dark-haired waitress floated
toward him with his breakfast  a plate
full of eyes. The pounding continued,
growing louder on the inside of his skull
until he finally woke on a sweat-soaked
mattress, halfway thawed from the deep
freeze of his own dope habit. His open
eyes told him that he was sick with with-
drawl, again in a tiny room in the Island
Hotel.

Someone knocked on his door, and a
female voice called his name

“Star, open up. it's Christina.”

Blue-green walls seemed to press
toward him from four directions. Star sat
up, naked on his bed, and shivered
despite the July heat, dropping his feet
into his greasy black jeans.

“Come on, Star,” Christina began to
whine, “open.”

He ,swung the door open on her
before she finished the words and
focused his eyes on her dim outline as
she emerged from the murky hall.

“Been there long?" asked Star.

“Yeah, a coupla minutes."

Christina’s brown skin and black hair
turned a vague green beneath the
flouescent light. She wore cut-off
shorts, unlaced high-tops and a T-shirt.
Her hair was pied on top of her head.

“Were you sleeping?” she asked.

“Yeah,” he mumbled, buttoning a
shirt. “I thought I was dreaming. I WAS
dreaming and you, all this some thin
memory when I woke up.”

A brief silence pressed down on the
room and brought Star three steps
closer to conciousness.

“You just gonna stand there talking
shit all night,” Christina finally asked,
“or you gonna invite me in?”

“Come on in then.”

They shuffled backward together on a
thin aisle of carpet and sat together on
the bed.

“You were just dreaming of me, stand-
ing there outside your door,” she said.
“Something told you I was coming.”

“That so?”

She just looked at him with eyes that
leaked conviction, and nodded her head.
Star liked the way her thin black brows
arched a little higher over her eyes when
she smiled. Her cheeks were set high in
her acne-scarred, Indian face. Star
remembered the photo that she showed
him once of a pimply, teenaged Christina,
smiling in a bikini on some South
American beach. That was a good night,
that party. Everyone flush enough to
show snapshots and exchange shreds of
happier times. Times long gone, he
thought, since that series of mistakes
they called a life had condemmed them
all to the Island.

“Dontcha want to know what brings to
your room, to ask of your precious time,
Star?”

“Yeah, that’s a good one.”

“We’re having a little party in my room.
We got a bottle of rum and some limes.
Ron con coca-cola if you wanna 

“We?” he asked. “You still monkeyin’
around with whatsis face?”

“Havi. Yeah, but 

Christina ran a hand under Star's shirt,
over his back, raising goose pimples on
his dope-sick skin.

“You and me  we go back a ways.”

The words dusted of his sleeping sex
drive and sparked a current that crackled
along his spine. Bodies walked past
Star's barred, street-level window drop-
ping cigarette wrappers and bits of
Spanish as they drifted by. When she ran
her hand down over one of his arms, she
grabbed the wrist and held it out to see

 

the dark needle marks running along the
veins.

“Christ,” she said. ‘‘I thought you were
supposed to be off that shit.”

"Don't I know it honey."

Star was surprised, and a little
ashamed, at how genuine her anger
seemed.

“That shit ain't nothin' but ugly. I
thought you looked like hell 

"Whatddya mean?" he whined. Star
stepped toward the distorted dresser mir-
ror and pulled the skin of his own warped
reflection down on his cheeks. A 25-year-
old kid looked with blind eyes at a face
the color of cigarette ash. the corners of
his mouth were turned perpetually down-
ward. Shrunken and sallow, he was 20

‘‘I might feel like death warmed over,”
he said, “But I still have my looks.”

“Go ahead and think you're funny. You
won’t be able to keep this up forever, it's
gonna catch up to you someday and,
man, you're gonna get old and ugly and
die before your time.”

Star turned from the mirror with an
expressionless face. Christina’s words
might as well have been trash tossed out
to rot.

“Yeah but that happens to everyone.
Why shouldn't I get high?”

“Fuck,” she said. “I don't wanna get
into all this. You comin’ up to our little
party our what?”

“Gimme a minute,” he said. “First I
gotta see a man about 

“Yeah, yeah  Christina cut him off
and said,  . .see a man about some
horse.”

When Christina left for her room,
upstairs on the fourth floor, Star stepped
into his tiny water closet and pulled his
works out from behind the toilet. He still
had a couple of good cottons in the
spoon, dried into rock hard remnants of
an earlier fix. He wet these down and
tried to get a hit. Something to hold him
before he came totally unglued, before
the vague dark and hairy leaped from out
of his own wilted skin to devour him,
drown him with tears. When Christina
touched him he almost shattered 
almost spilled his whole procession of
personal losses right into her lap. He
tapped the dim solution down in his rig
and spiked it in. A thin metallic taste rose
in his throat while the smell of fried food
drifted into his room, riding the dirty
breeze. Damn, he thought with a sigh,
hungry, again.

Christina stayed in a double, a room

MM   I

slightly larger than Star's, but her four
walls had the same claustrophobic effect
as his, pressing like a trash compactor on
whoever sat behind them. When Star
showed up he found her sitting at a table,
drinking with that sneering, black-eyed
bullfrog, Havi. In the heat, Christina had
stripped away her T-shirt and sat bare-
chested, half-drunk, reading from a book
of some rock star's poems. A dirty win-
dow fan strained to suck the day's heat
from the room.

“Star,” they called when he came
through the door.

“Come in my friend," said Havi, “and
sit."

If he smiles any harder, thought Star,
he’s gonna drip blood from his fangs.

 

:‘T'-L. cf-,';,i.li:rA,

jg,-...,\ .

Who's gonna be the first to bite here?
The frog or the bare tittied girl?

“Have a drink?" asked Havi.

“Thanks, I could use one right about
now.”

Christina kept a hold on the book and
shuffled the pages with her thumb.

‘‘I like to stmm the pages and then just
read what comes up at random. Like this

Star stood up again and leaned over
her bare shoulder. His stomach clamped.
He was so close to her he could touch
her, lay his hands on her and let her
chase away the chill that harrassed his
bones. Christina pointed to one of the
lines in the book.

“Check it out,” she said.

The lines said something about a
judgement day. She seemed to find
some significance in that.

“Ooh shit!” she hissed, snapping her
fingers the way she always did when she
thought something amazing had hap-
pened. This sign language of a Spanish
whore cut through the thin walls of a cot-
ton shot. Star felt his skin flush and the
red rise up to his scalp. She’s what’s
amazing, he thought, sitting here half-
naked, reading from that damn book 
too much. Her eyes were wild and her
grin was a gold mine. We could run
away, he told himself, to Texas or some
Mexican motel where the sun could bake
away the blues. He instantly imagined
them living together, their love stuffed
into some starched white salvation, lead-
ing a new, clean life. He sat down to pour
himself another shot of rum. A big smile
spread across his face as he raced, lost
and laughing, through his own reverie.

“You like what you see, eh?” asked
Havi.

Star said nothing, took another tug at
his drink.

‘‘I mean,” Havi pushed on, “Christina,

 
 

she looks pretty good to you. You’d like
to have a spin with her, eh?”

“Havi cut it out,” said Christina. “You're
embarrassing me.”

Star sat as if he were nailed to the
back of his chair. The jones made it
seem as if his body was acquiring more
unwanted flesh and weight with each
heartbeat. He kept quiet.

‘‘I can see she does something for
you.”

When he said this Havi leaned fonlvard
in his chair, with his elbows on his knees
and his face raised to look at Star.

‘‘I can't tell," Star finally said, “if you
want to cut me or kiss me.”

Havi bolted out of his chair and
grabbed Christina's shirt from the bed

and toosed it at her. He was yelling
something in Spanish which Star
guessed had to do with covering herself.
Christina sat still, picking her nails and
looking at Havi in silence.

Some time passed before they finished
Christina’s bottle of rum. Havi finally got
disgusted and left Star and Christina
alone. Star lay sprawled on the floor,
shivering, getting sicker. The rum
coursed through his veins but never
seemed to find a place to settle in his
body. He stood and went down the hall
to the bathroom, and when he came
back Christina was lying on her small
bed.

“Christina,” he asked, “you got any
money?"

‘What do you need money for Star?”

“What do you think?”

“Unh-uh, I’m not giving you money for
that shit. Besides I only have a couple
of dollars.”

He tried to sit down in one of her chairs
but it was too stiff-. " ,

“Mind if I lie down with you?”

‘‘I don't mind.”

She made room for him.on_ the bed.

Their bodies pressed together, arms and
legs entwined. He caught the strong

, smell of expired poisons seeping through

his skin and wondered how she could
stand to embrace him like this. He
thought he would chip and shatter into a
thousand tiny pieces when she ran one
of her hands between the buttons of his
shirt and over his skin.

“What about Havi?” he asked. “Won’t
he be back soon?”

“I dunno, maybe.”

She got his shirt off, and they pressed
their bare chests together. Star liked the
patches of black tossed over a brown
background, her body. He also liked the
sweet smell of rum that she breathed
against his face. Her hand slid down into
his jeans and jerked him slowly. The hot
and cold flashes ran away. All nerves
pointed to his prick in the hand of this
kind whore. Tugging and breathing, four
stories above the street. Star was freed
for an instant from his own hunger. He
never wanted that minute to end, but
then it did, quickly. He rose from the bed
and walked over to the table to take
another drink from a bottle that was
gone.

“That didn’t take long,” she said.

“Sorry.”

There was a knock at the door, but
before Christina could answer Havi came
bursting into the room. The scene didn’t
look too good, since Star had joined
Christina in walking around the room
half-naked.

“Put you goddamned shirt on,” said
Havi.

“Oh man," Christina fired back, “you
make me tired.”

Star waited for Havi to direct some of

the no—verse

by staphania alarcon

On March 22, as the sun
crossed the celestial equator,
poet Rob Casper lankily strode
up to the decked-out Beehive
stage to greet musicians The
Seven Goats and their big-kid
menagerie of musical imple-
ments. Casper’s white T-shirt
and medium-faded jeans just
slightly invoked the ghost of
James Dean. He took the micro-
phone out of the stand, looked
back and nodded to the band.

Then the whole stage
launched itself into some
kamikaze Armageddon fury. A
million bludgeons of percussion
raced around like electrons
enveloping Casper’s screaming
voice in a bed of rage. Wrapped
inside passion’s romper room,
his body contorted while his face
flushed bright red and the veins
in his forehead threatened to
burst.

And then it all stopped. His
face went back to normal. A
calm, proper poet's voice recited
a line I was too shocked to write
down.

Then it happened again with a
vengeance. _This time, the
poem’s epileptic electrocution
put Casper crawling on his back
across the floor, then writhing up
off the floor, and somewhere
along the line sent the micro-
phone careening into his lip.

When it was finally over he
got up and noticed the blood
oozing from his mouth. The
audience went wild for the 15th
time in honor of this 15th perfor-
mance of the evening. And Jack
Kerouac stepped down from that
big coffeehouse in the sky to sit
and smoke and smile.

For a while, my pretentious

definition of poetry was to boil
down an experience until it’s as
thick as blood. I was open-
mouthed and humbled when I
witnessed a poetry reading
where blood was actually drawn.
There’s something big happen-
ing in this Pittsburgh place.

Formally called “The Spring
Equinox Poetry and Drum
Festival,” this performance
showcased the melding of
eleven of Pitt’s best poets and
three talented, intuitive musi-
cians. lt was an exhilarating
example of Pittsburgh’s up-and-
bubbling melting pot of poetry
and music. Poetry has long
been one of the city's best kept
secrets. But this year, the clots-
ter has decided to break its
silence.

Pittsburgh’s first poetry slams
in recent memory were orga-
nized this summer by Regina
McCullough and Christian
Robinson to choose spoken
word artists for the Lollapalooza
Tour. The turnout at the first
slam was so enormous that the
competition had to be split into
categories for over and under
21. The city seemed to be thirst-
ing for something new, and this
rugged form that has thrived for
years in places like Philadelphia,
Chicago and New York was just
the thing to stake it.

A slam is a sort of literary
Gong Show wherein randomly
selected judges rate brave read-
ers’ poems and performances
on a scales from one to five.
Winners are often given mone-
tary prizes —— just enough for
Cummings in paperback and a
round of cappuccino.
Meanwhile, the audience puts in

its two cents in raucous cheers
and jeers. Well, in rougher cities,
anyway. Liz Ahl, a Master of
Fine Arts (MFA) student and
Hemingway’s series coordinator
said a Boston slam she saw —
but shied away from competing
in — “was a lot more hard-core.
The audience here is really nice

there was heckling in Boston. It
was a lot more intense.”
Pittsburgh, in its polite naivete
and friendly solidarity hasn’t
quite mustered up the gall to spit
upon the bared souls of its slam
contestants. Maybe it’s better
that way.

Anyway, there are nationally
accepted guidelines for slams
that put a fence around the
chaos and keep it something
like fair. For example, no props
or accompaniment are allowed
and poems must be kept to
under two minutes.

However, packing the audi-
ence with friends (who have a
good chance of being chosen as

judges) is never mentioned on 1

the no-no list, as Terry Carroll,
one of the Poetry and Drum fes-
tival poets and wordsmith for the
band Step Left Foot points out.
“I hate poetry slams. The scene
is pretty open [and] it’s good that
you can go and they have the
potential to make money for
basically nothing, but it turns art
into sport, and plus, most of the
poetry sucks.”

Mike Flor (a.k.a. “Jello”), one
of the Lollapalooza slam winners
who competed in subsequent
slams on the tour in Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia, begs to differ.

were really friendly. I got to talk

THE

ACADEIWY
DOES Ahl DY

Forget about the Bucs, the Pens, and
that other team. The true spirit of the Iron
City can be found in the legacy of the
White Haired Trinity: Andy Warhol, Don
Cannon, and  uh  Mayor Murphy.
Well, Muphy gets too much press as it is,
and I figure we should give old Don a
break, so it looks like it’s time for
Pittsburgh to celebrate the life and
accomplishments of Andy Warhol 
again.

Now, a scant year after the opening
festivities of Andy’s Themepark, the
University of Pittsburgh’s Cultural
Studies and Film Studies Programs-and
the Warhol Museum present “Warhol’s
Worlds,” the Inaugural Conference of the
Andy Warhol Museum. Basically this is a
series'of lectures that will take place this
weekend, beginning Friday, April 21st at
the Carnegie Lecture Hall, and continu-
ing at the Warhol with five more
lectureldiscussion panels on Saturday
and Sunday.

OK, you may be wondering why Pitt is
involved in this thing anyway. Apparently,
this conference was the brainchild of
Professor Colin MacCabe, Pitt’s acting
director of cultural studies and confer-
ence organizer. Over the past few years,
along with Warhol Curator Mark Francis
and Carnegie Museum Curator of Film
and Video Bill Judson, MacCabe has
seen this dream come to fruition. A gen-
erous contribution by the Pinewood
Foundation didn’t hurt, either.

“The rationale of. the conference is that
Warhol is still insufficiently understood,”
writes MacCabe in his letters to invited
panelists,  the aim of the conference is
to try’ and assess Warhol’s importance
across the whole range of practice from
fashion to film, from the paintings to the
diaries.”“- “  

"Thatwarhol and his work are misun-
derstood by the general public is proba-

 

bly true, despite the fact that
his name and image are prob-
ably the most easily recogniz-
able of any artist in the last
century. The range of Warhol’s
influence is also considerably
large. I mean, God forbid,
imagine this: if there was no
Warhol, do you think there
would be any such thing today
as MTV? Hmm  now there’s
some appetizing food for
thought.

This promises to be a pretty
highbrow event, especially
since tickets for the confer-
ence run a hefty 75 bucks for
real people, $30 for students.
There is also the option of

night’s keynote lecture with
Christopher Hitchens, official imported
cultural critic for Vanity Fair.

Hitchens will be speaking on “The
Importance of Being Andy.” Apparently,
this guy can gab about a variety of sub-
jects, but, since I haven't read Vanity Fair
since the Courtney Love debacle, I can't
really vouch for his writing. I can say that
his publicity photo on the flyer for the
event makes him look pretty hard to take
seriously.

Other noteworthy speakers this week-
end include Jon Savage, who wrote that
book on the Sex Pistols, speaking about
the Velvet Underground on Saturday
afternoon, and founding VU member
John Cale himself will be returning to the
museum on Sunday to speak. Warhol
superstar Ultra Violet will give an interac-
tive slide presentation Saturday night.
Her focus will be on Warhol’s work from
an art historical perspective. I hope that
it’s a bit more comprehensive than her
“book” about her life with Warhol. All I
gained from that were the intimate details

of her sex life with Salvador Dali, among
others.

All in all, this thing promises to be
potentially interesting. I wonder how
many people are actually going to pay to
attend, though. I mean, the average
Pittsburgher who may have taken the
kids to check out the toned-down perver-
sions of the Warhol Museum is certainly
not going to shell out any cash for this
thing just to gain a better understanding
of Andy’s importance as a transitional fig-
ure between Modernism and
Postmodernism. And anyone else in
attendance probably “understands" the
relative importance of Warhol anyway,
but at least this conference might be
enough to piss off conservative art and
social criticHilton Kramer, who seems to
think that the world would somehow be a
better place if the museum had never
been built.

So if you’ve recently inherited some
dough, and the price doesn’t quite seem
unreasonable enough for you, this week-
end should be full of fun for art lovers,

really a shame that there aren't at least
individual rates for each panel discus-
sion, but I guess it would be hard to kick
people out once they’re inside the place,
I don’t know. Oh well, the poor get shaft-
ed again. It sort of makes sense, I sup-
pose, considering that while Warhol cre-
ated art that the common folk could at
least visually identify with, his manipula-
tion of art as commodity resulted natural-

The Twilight of The Golds

Written by Jonathon Tolins
Directed by Thom
McLaughlin

How would you like to be
the proud parents of a bril-
liant left-handed homo?
That’s the scenario in The
Twilight of the Golds, a New
York-based show debuting
at The Upstairs Theatre
tonight. The stage is set in a
Manhattan apartment fully
adorned with middle class
yuppies Suzanne (Robin
Beruh) and Rob (Scott
Thewes). It's the near future
which gives the show an
eerie irony. Rob is a genetic
researcher who has been
involved in extensive DNA
studies. The futures Lab
Lords have developed a
method of detecting inborn
diseases with amniocente-
sis. We come to find out
Suzanne is pregnant with a
talented, intelligent queer!
Well, that's not so strange is
it? (Except that in this play’s
post-Newt setting homosex-
uality is officially a disease.)

Well, Suzanne’s loud
Jewish New York parents
(Audrey Castracane and
Walter Gold) had a pretty
tough time accepting their
eccentric homosexual son,
David (David Guion), the
baby in question's uncle.
So,‘ the question is: does
this typical couple want to
raise a son that will struggle
"to be accepted in our won-

derful judgmental society?
David makes a good argu-
ment for the possibility of
living out of social norms
We get a rounded charac-
terization of his vibrant life
through his continiuos nar-
ration with operas. So he's
got a lot of creativity Why
don’t we need more of him
in our society?.

Jonathan Tolins (play-
wright) demands of his
audience is that we ask our-
selves what it means to
exist in a world burdened by
too much information via
technology. lt’s become
dangerously trendy to
become submissive and let
other people control our
thoughts and morals. That
is the whole dysfunctional-
ism of this show. The whole
family cliché pulls us into
the hidden message fram-
ing the characters. Whether
we want to admit it or not
there are personal experi-
ences that surface anxiety
which our society isn't ready
to contend with. Behind this
play explodes that same
passion and energy.

There is a painfully innov-
ative comedy lacing the
story which makes it enter-
taining and informative all in
one. What does it mean to
be a freak, and aren’t we all
in some way freakish? With
comparison to the present,
the characters reside in an
information hole that attacks
all beauty of existance.

What happened to the
“glory of living?” Wouldn't
you think that we need a
variety of people to balance
the world out. What is living
if we are constantly being
poured into shallow droids
of life? What great dinner
time discussions. Hey
Honey! Do you doubt your
ability to love? Come on, we
all need a little unnecessary
misery to get us started in
the morning.

All of this and more can
be found draping the
antique walls of The
Upstairs Theatre. Thom
McLaughlin addresses the
ideas behind the dangerous
presence of knowledge that
is presently growing all
around us. Along with a
cast of brilliant actors all
motivated by the same
artistic fever the show is
perfect for any night when
your out looking for some-
thing to do. It has a great
comic twist that dances with
powerful issues of public
tragedy. Not a bad combi-
nation! The Upstairs

age-old earth beneath the nails. He used

this instrument — this instrument of
sausage skin and muddy grime —— to
squeeze triggers and plunge blades into
pale flesh like pudding.

 

I saw it as it touched the face of his
dear daughter — wishing her well and
luck with her graduate program in the
mountains. It softly slid along the curves
of cheekbone and the downy hair loving-

 ly, saying: “l’ll miss you, darling one.

tle girl — praising him with her eyes and
touching the instrument of foulness

feeling.
The same hand closed her car
door and patted it for good luck.

 Waved “Bye-Bye Darling" and then into a

pocket of pant, feeling keys to a home by

 the lake and the forest green Mercedes,

a keychain with her picture. Tonight a
trigger to squeeze and then holding a
cloth to wipe away its prints. More earth
beneath the nail from ground deep in the
woods and a splinter from the same
shovel kept hanging in the garage above
his daughter’s bike from childhood. The
same hand that would hold the face of
wife for “Goodnight  Sweet Dreams” as
for 32 years now.

Moonlighting on the hand in woods.
Tendons show through the rubbery cov-
ering and the wood of the pistol handle is
moist from glands on the palm. This
instrument doesn’t see the figure behind
the trees beyond the hole in the earth

7

where its twin points, directing the prey
to its knees. This hand with dirt in web-
bing. This instrument driving the patterns
behind the skull where the image of his
daughter lies beneath a blanket of fog.
Then white, bright light of spark and
flame and then again and the instrument
is given rest, left hanging to side next to
pocket. Now the job of shovel and earth

 

and the figure behind the trees walks
away under moon and stars.

Next day the hand is reaching for an
orange next to the figure selecting the
right bunch of bananas. There is laugh-
ter, wife and owner of instrument joking
about who’s doing the cooking. l brush it,
accidentally, and it answers with knuck-
les. “Sorry,” (me) and "That’s alright,
buddy.” The instrument takes the wife’s
own and they walk into sunlit lot —
smiles and mouths watering, thinking of
tonight’s meal. I watch it open the car
door for the wife, thinking of it closing
one for the daughter.

Tonight I will test mine. It is not with
band and not caked with earth. This one
is slim and pale. The bones are clearly
visible. A claw. Perfect under moonlight.

:1 1:2. .
to talk about lgls... newur gravel,
We n «I e r B o ys.         

takes a closer look.

M i c h a e I-
Chabon brought
me to Pittsburgh.

He told me
about the Cloud
Factory, and
a b o u t
Hemingway’s. He
also talked about
Hillman library,
where on occa-
sion lovers would
meet among the
stacks of refer-
ence books to
c o n s u m m a t e
their desires.

While I was
never mentioned 3
by name in the
introduction of
Chabon’s first book The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh, where
he told me all of this, it was
clearly written for me. It was so
clear, in fact, that I left the
uneventful campus of West
Chester University and trans-
ferred to Pitt, sight unseen. If
you’re assuming l’m a fool for
leaving West Chester on a
whim, you’ve obviously never
been there.

Hell, if Chabon at 23 could
walk out of Pitt’s undergraduate
school with The Mysteries of
Pittsburgh tucked under his arm,
boasting the powerfully written
personae of Arthur, Cleveland
and Phlox, then I could make
that five hour move to the
‘Burgh. I needed the inspiration
that Chabon had successfully
tapped from Pittsburgh.

it seems appropriate then, just
a few weeks prior to my impend-
ing graduation, that Chabon
would choose to set his second
novel once more in the City of
Steel, among the urban sprawl
of Pitt no less.

And while the main protago-
nist from Wonder Boys is no
longer the sexually-confused
graduate student cruising the
streets of Oakland as was the
case in Mysteries, Chabon intro-
duces us to Grady Tripp. And
we watch as this overweight,
forty-something, fatty-rolling
novelist/writing teacher is trying
to complete his 2,000 plus page
opus as his life crumbles around
him.

Wonder Boys for the most
part, takes place during
WordFest weekend, a writing
workshop held at the University
of Pittsburgh. To complicate
matters worse, Grady’s wife is
ready to leave him after discov-
ering her husband's affair with
the Chancellor. The Chancellor,
making matters worse, is mar-
ried to Grady’s boss in the
English Department.

Enter Grady’s closest friend,
Terry Crabtree, who shows up
at the airport with a young trans-
vestite from Bloomfield. “I
attempted to make an unobtru-
sive study of the architecture of
Miss Sloviak’s throat, but she'd
tied a brightly patterned scarf
around her neck. That in itself
was a kind of clue, I supposed.”

Add to the motley crew Grady’s

reclusive, suicidal writing stu-
dent, James Leer, who may or
may not have made up his
entire life to fit the one
described in his book.

Leer in tow, and with a dead
dog and tuba in the trunk, Grady
heads to his in-laws to celebrate
Seder. It is at the house of his
soon-to-be ex-wife’s parents,
where some of the best descrip-
tion appears. The scenario
alone, of Grady, James and his
in-laws, adoptive children and
all, sitting around the dinning
room table is enough to chisel a
smile into any stony-faced cynic.
“Dutifully Irv set about answer-
ing the four questions. He
looked around the table, (at
which sat three native Koreans,
a converted Baptist, a badly
lapsed Methodist and a Catholic
of questionable but tormented
strip,) lifted his Haggadah, and
began unironically, ‘Once we
were slaves in Egypt...’”

Chabon has a way letting the
reader see some of the most
ridiculous characters in the most
absurd setting, yet allows us to
feel an overwhelming amount of
sympathy towards him or her, or
(s)he. Leer is a perfect example
of this. When he isn't lying, he’s
stealing, and yet you find your-
self enthralled by his relation-
ship with Crabtree, the only
character more screwed up than
him. You read on, hoping they’ll
support rather than tear each
other down.

With a seven-year lapse
between novels, the only thing

‘released during that time was a

mediocre collection of short sto-
ries compiled in A Model World,
many in the wondered if Chabon
would become the literary equiv-
alent of Men Without Hats, (do
you remember them? That's my
point.) According to reports by
his publicist, Chabon was trying
to tailor the 1500- page piece he
had set out to conquer, in a fal-
tering attempt to hold the read-
er’s attention. For the sake of
his readers and career, the
attempt was ditched.

But similarities between
Wonder Boy’s Grady and
Chabon don’t end at their pen-
chant for wordy text. Both are

Along the way we saw
American culture through a
unique multi-media presenta-
tion that put recent history in a
new light.

when trying to tell people
what the show was going to be,
I told them that it was some-
thing like a live music video.
Now that I've seen the show,
however, I realize how off-base
this assessment was. Laurie
Anderson is billed as a perfor-
mance artist, which can be a
vague term meaning many dif-
ferent things. Unfortunately, it
usually evokes images of peo-
ple screaming and pouring
chocolate all over themselves.
in this case, it was something
much more powerful.

It was a show made up of
many elements: music, spoken
word, visual images and techni-
cal prestidigitation. There were
three screens which formed a
backdrop of continuously
changing scenery. While it often
bordered on surreal, neverthe-
less, it was grounded in things
very close to American culture.

The show wound up being a
critical look at what this country
is. Each section was introduced
by Anderson playing on her
electrified violin, turning on a
camera attached to the bow at
various points. At one point,
she recounted how our culture
has become superficial by talk-
ing about tips given by U.S.
government directives for
Americans traveling abroad to
protect themselves from terror-
ists.

"T he idea was not to call our-
selves to the attention of the
numerous foreign terrorists who
are presumably lurking all over
the terminals. So the embassy
tips is a list of mostly ‘don’ts,’
things like:

Don’t wear a baseball cap.
Don’t wear a sweatshirt with the
name of an American university
on it.

Don’t wear Timberlands with no
socks.

Don’t chew gum.

Don’t yell (‘Ethyll Our plane is
leavingl’)

‘‘I mean, it's weird when your
entire culture can be summed
up in eight giveaway character-
istics.”

When you take a look around
at American culture today, it
unfortunately seems to be
summed up in this way. The Pitt
campus is a garish example of
it.

This was the kind of show in
which the audience had to pay
attention at every moment in
order to be clued into what was
happening. There were small
lines, almost throwaway lines,

which carried with them quite a
message, both in the songs and
stories: “When my father died, it
was like a library burning to the
ground.” These ideas carry
Laurie Anderson far beyond the
realm of narrowly conceived
notions of performance art.

Yet, as we move ahead into
the information age, the spaces
in which these ideas are pre-
sented are almost equally
important. They are created in
an electronic architecture which
combines the use of lasers,
voice filters, digital audio tapes,
smoke machines and computer
generated images, to name a
few devices used throughout
the show. Beginning with the
smart bomb footage of the Gulf
War, the show moved through
the last presidential election,
with a recording of James
Stockda|e’s thoughts on his
experience running a civilization
of POWs, to today. Reactions
to that technology from customs
agents and others made for an
interesting look at society. it
would be worth finding a
recording of Anderson using the
“voice of authority” filter just for
the sound.

‘‘If there is an angry God,
then I want to look into his
angry face,” Anderson said at
one point. In a society that often
attempts to play God, the show
is a reflection of its face. There
is an examination of the way we
are moving as a society.

For those who did not get to
see the show, but are interest-
ed as to what this is all about, it
is possible to check out the
Stories From the Nerve Bible
tour on the World Wide Web.
The address is http://www.voy-
agerco.com. This will give a
start to anyone interested in
exploring Laurie Anderson’s
works beyond a 30-second slot
on MTV. Her career involves as
many mediums as her stage
work. Books such as Stories
From the Nerve Bible and
America: I-IV, complement
recordings such as Home of the
Brave and CD-ROM discs like
Puppet Motel. Some of these
are available at both the
Hillman and Carnegie libraries.

At the core of all this work,
and most notably as one of the
central themes of the Nerve
Bible Tour, is the question “are
we getting better, or are we get-
ting worse?” The answer was
better, but it is happening so
fast that we don’t notice.

The Nerve Bible tour lets us
take a look at where we are,
with the Gulf War as a starting
point, and gives us a little time
and food for thought to consider
whether we are getting better or
not.

Urban Dance Squad

Persona Non Grata
Virgin

Why does Urban Dance
Squad leave the sour sound of
Galliano ringing in my ears?
Perhaps it is because (like
Galliano) their music sucks
lemons. We all remember
Galliano, don’t we? The cultish,
tribal do-gooders who sang of
nihilism and god shopping.
Don’t cringe, I’m the onethat
actually had to endure the entire
album. After chopping off the
high-sounding head of Galliano,
yet another nauseating noggin
has sprung up by the name of
Urban Dance Squad. C’mon,
can't an entertainment-starved
American youth, such as myself,
get hardcore dance music with-
out having to appeal to the
imports? Urban Dance Squad
is not “dance” music, it’s music
you clean your toilet bowl to. Its
just stupid. -

The beats are reminiscent of
‘‘Fraggle Rock” prepubescent
bullshit. My easily amused 12-
year-old little sister wouIdn’t
dance to this crap. She would
probably use it as background
music for Barbie. I don’t think
even Barbie would appreciate
that very much. You just have to
hear it! No you don’t. Just take
my word for it, Urban Dance
Squad is a very misleading title.

I must admit that when I first
heard of Dance Squad, I was
expecting throbbing bass, stylo-
phonic synthesizers and hip-
swaying guitar ranks. Was I ask-
ing too much? Prodigy wouldn’t
think so. What did I get? Well,
let me just tell you that
“Demagogue” is the closest
thing to it, but not close enough.

'lt’s the only song worth mention-

ing on the album because it
made me bop my head twice.
Other than that, it’s cheerleader
dance routine crap. (No offense
to the cheerleaders — I would
never attend a cheerleader).

Overall, the album is too
dated. Their sound has been
milled into the dance floors too
many times before. It was nice
in '89, but in my millenium-type
club scene, it just doesn’t apply.
If you’re stiff and uncoordinated,
this album would be perfect for
you. Otherwise, pass it up.

Urban Dance League’s sound
is grossly tamed and flowery.
They put too much emphasis on
the “Urban” and neglected the
“Dance.” The beats drag behind
the over-dramatized, discordant
vocals. In addition, the songs
preach too much (just like
Galliano). My only interest was
dancing, not reforming the moral
structure of society. When lis-
tening to “dance” music, I don’t
give a damn about the tried soul
of the lead vocalist. Evangelical
dance music just does not
appeal to me. I don’t want to
think, I want to dance. Get outta
my head and move my body.

April 20 1995

 

That’s what dance music can do
for me. Anything else is for the
“Fragg|es.”

Chris Whitley

Din of Ecstasy
Sony

“New brittle architecture,”
Chris Whitley whispers before
“New Machine,” one of the
tracks on his long-awaited sec-
ond album. Despite the driving
sound, which is sometimes rem-
iniscent of roadhouse music,
this album does have a brittle
architecture of both music and
lyrics.

After four years, Chris Whitley
has returned with a second
album. For those who heard his
first, “Living With the Law,” this
album is long overdue, but you
can’t force art. This album is a
departure from the more
acoustic country blues sound of
the first. Bucking the trend,
Whitley has plugged in again.

Songs such as “.OGod My
Heart is Ready?’ have a driving
beat Which. makes it easy to see
how the blues gave birth to rock
and roll. At the same time, there
are slower, more bluesy*num-
bers such as “God Thing” which
are closer to the roots, and num-
bers wh‘icl'i"= lie somewhere in
between, such as “Can’t Get
Off.”

Musically, there are a number
of levels to this album.
Headphones help the richness
of this album came out, but it is
just as good played through
speakers. But to capture the
feel, it is better played loud. The
music has a rich feel which
lends itself to sweeping you up
into the album.

Lyrically, Whitley shows his
ability to write lyrics, which
although they are obviously very
personal, can hit the listener
close to the bone as well. In
fact, about the only compaint I
have is that the lyrics are hand-
written on the case and the
songs aren’t clearly divided, so
it's hard to grab up the lyric
sheet to see what he sang just
after he sang it.

The album also shows why he
was voted best new male vocal-
ist of 1991 by the critics in
Rolling Stone magazine. His
vocals are as good as ever,
though they need to be paid
attention to over the rich musical
backdrop. These are not throw-
away lyrics.

My one fear for this album is
that it may be labeled as a
grunge album. While some of
the music is vaguely reminiscent
of some of what America has
heard come out of Seattle in
recent years, but this album is
what grunge could have been
were it well-written and per-
formed. A friend of mine
described it as a “bluesy Pearl

You fuck
like Christmas

For those of you who went
nuts over local psychedelic
scumpunk legends Couch for
more reasons than guitarist Jeff
Byers’ naked balls, here’s a little
info on what has risen from the
ashes of the band that was too
nude to handle.

First, of course, there’s
Sauce, whose entire catalogue
is documented on Lord Byron’s
Sweet Pea/Blowdz label. That’s
Byers on gits, Mr. Dixon
Greasemonkey pounding the
human fleshskins and, of
course, local gangsta rap sen-
sation Tone L Glue on guitar
and assorted electronic media
(typewriters, heroin, etc).
Famous former WPTS MANLY
MAN and former Skablin gui-
tarist/Couch bassist Juddie
Hopper now slides his acoustic
ass all over the place with The
Johnsons, soon to debut. Keep
an eye out.

But, for the more (or less) lit-
erary minded folks out there,
former Couch co-conspirator
Karl Raszewski 2 has recently
unleashed his first in what
promises to be a long series of
literary publications. Clocking in
at an impressive 208 pages, the
book is called “A- (Portrait of an
Artist Sleepin’ In).”

“A-” is a stinking dirty rotten
journey through the sad state of
this cat's whiskey-drenched life,
in which Raszewski 2 always
seems to come out on top. The
medium is poetry, with illustra-
tions by Raszewski 2 and his
true love, Renee Boylan. One
glance at the time-consuming
craftman&womanship of the
illustrations and you'll realize
that these two are serious about
their art.

Obviously descended from
the high-minded likes of the late
Charles Bukowski, Raszewski’s
work covers some of the same

ground, with the exception of
horse racing and the added
attraction of bundles and bun-
dles of heroin.

His spelling and his math may
not be too swell, and his oh-so
delicate position in the precari-
ous realm of gender politics
may not win him any points with
female readers, but anyone who
has ever heard Raszewski per-
form his poetry live knows that
he doesn’t leave an audience
with much to complain about. In
short, he delivers the goods.

His titles alone crack me up.
Some personal favorites: the
illustration “you fuck like christ-
mas,” “you had to say that thing
about poets into my cigarette,”
“do that impression of me where
you puke” and “jessy’s cafe, not
his girl.” Fiaszewski, as with the
best artists, is weaving a per-
sonal mythology even as you
read this.

Anyone interested in picking
up a copy of “A-” can look for
the guy with the  hat on this
Friday night at the Forbes
Gallery (5200 Forbes Ave.-CMU
territory) from 7-9 p.m. The
event is the closing reception
for graduating CMU artists Zak
Shuman, Ftob Weiss and
Raymund Appleby. Appleby
described his piece as “a vehi-
cle for cultural exploration 
using furniture”. Weiss’s piece
is an audio-visual sculpture, and
Shuman has created “a really
huge musical instrument.”
Raszewski will be skulking
around with copies of his book
for sale for a reasonable price.
Show up and be enlightened.

For more information on
obtaining a copy of “A- (Portrait
of an Artist Sleepin’ In),” call
Raszewski at (412) 681-2574,
or write him at 3418 Ward
Street, Apt #3, Pittsburgh, PA

su ering mm the midnight dis-
ease Grady constantly refers to
when thoughts drift towards the
remnants of his book. “At every
conscious moment its victims 
feels like a person lying in a
sweltering bedroom, with the
window thrown open, looking at
a sky filled with stars and air-
planes, listening to the narrative
of a rattling blind, an ambu-
lance, a fly trapped in a coke
bottle, while all around him the
neighbors sleep soundly,”
explains Grady.

The striking similarities
between Grady and Chabon
bring me to my next point. In a
recent interview, Chabon stated
that -after theirelease of The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh, people
from all over the city were claim-

ing to be the actual characters, ‘

or at least based on them. In
defense, Chabon offered, “l’m
anticipating that probably some-
thing similar will go on again.
But it’s a novel so..." Obviously,
you write about what you know.
Wonder Boys, revolving mainly
around a writer and his student,
are both subjects Chabon can
relate to. On the other hand,
The Mysteries of Pittsburgh

ends with, “The people I loved
were celebrities, surrounded by
rumor and fanfare; the places I
sat with them, movie lots and
monuments. No doubt all of this
is not true remembrance but the
ruinous work of nostalgia, which
obliterates the past, and no
doubt, as usual, I have exagger-
ated everything.”

Regardless of whether the
characters in his books are
friends and neighbors, or a roll
call of the people inside
Chabon’s head, it doesn’t take
away from the fact that his work
is immensely enjoyable. With
characters and images that stay
with the reader long after he or
she finishes page 368, Wonder
Boys is proof that Chabon wiH
continue to be avisible land-
mark on the literary road map of
modern American writers. And
while Chabon has gone on to
claim the record for the most
money paid for a debut piece of
literary fiction, he's also gar-
nered critical acclaim for all
three books by critics as diverse
as The New York Times Book
Review and The Voice Literary
Supplement, among others. I,
meanwhile, have put in time at
The Pitt News, covering Slovak
Festivals. I guess we all can't be
Boy Wonders.

his aggression at
never came. All the yelling, all
the drama pressed against
Star’s nerves with too much
impact. He wrapped his fingers
around the neck of the empty
rum bottle for some kind of pro-
tection.

Havi and Christina were now
arguing in Spanish, and Star
had no idea what they were
saying. Some hot jazz, he
thought. Two people fighting in
a vaccum. That could be me.
Fuck, that would be me. With
the wall and the window at my
back. Knock his teeth down his
throat, Christi. Walk down the
halls and streets with strangers,
too ugly, too  afflicted  to
touch. No more than a passing
cum shot  l’m  a fuckin’ ass-
hole 

He felt stupid for dreaming. It
wasn't supposed to work that
way. in the wordless reaches of
his drug-addled mind, Star real-

ized that Christina, who stood
only two feet away, would
always be out of reach.

Standing by the window, Star
noticed that Christina’s purse
lay open on one of the chairs.
Three bills, large ones, glowed
in its open mouth. Christina’s
back was turned to him at that
moment, and for the most part
she blocked Havi’s view of him
as well. Star kept one eye on
them while he reached for the
money. Suddenly, Christina
turned her body so that Havi
could have seen Star, had he
been looking. Star darted his
hand back out of the bag. When
Christina and Havi went back at
it, he quickly snatched one of
the hundred dollar bills,
straightened up and made for
the door.

‘‘I think l’ll excuse myself,” he
announced.

Christina looked at him but
didn't speak.

“Yeah,” said Havi. “You do
that.”

 

Jam".“"He wasn’t listening care-
fully enough. There is a notica-
ble lack of the Eddie Vedder
angst. Whitley’s style goes back
before the Seattle craze.

Some folks may remember
Chris Whitley from when he
opened for Tom Petty’s tour in
1991. This is how l discovered
him, more or less. I saw an
interview with him on one of the
video stations that lasted about
30 seconds. They decided that
they could spare a little air time
for an opening act. I knew right

away that I had to check out the
album. I’ve bought both of his
albums without hearing more
than one song from each and
haven’t been disappointed yet.
You’lI not see him on MTV,
and he will probably not get
much airplay on the radio. if you
want to here some of the best
music recorded in this century,
however, you’re going to have
to go out and find it. Fortunatley,
Chris has found his way into a
studio, so it’s been recorded for
posterity.

Liz Ahl. The readings have long
consisted of excellent, talented,
but tentative and self-abasing
readers, many from the MFA
program at Pitt who would
approach the microphone as if it
were a rabid animal.

The flyers that Ahl and co-
organizer Chuck Plunkett make
betray the “stiffer" academic
character of the readings,
though. One features an enthu-
siastic 1940s-esque couple with
briefcases in hand, running
down the street to the caption,
“Poetry! Let’s go!” Hemingway's
was also the site of the debut
reading of works from Pitt’s
recently resurrected undergrad-
uate literary journal, “Papercut".

Thor Ringler, a soon-to-be
MFA recipient, has run the
Thursday night poetry series at
the Beehive since the fall of
1993. The audience has steadi-
ly grown over the past two years
and “this year in particular is

. kinda wild,” Ringler said. My

favorite Beehive flyer advertises
a “literary monster truck ralIy”,
challenging the public to “Be
there...if you can take the heat.”

The idea for the Spring
Equinox project at the Beehive
came about in conversations
Ringler had with Scott Prairie,
one of the musicians in The
Seven Goats. The two vaguely
talked about “doing something
with drums and poetry.” The
idea evolved into a month of
rehearsals and finally, that
bloodthirsty March 22nd perfor-
mance.

‘‘It was way, way different and
more interesting than I could
have imagined,” Ringler said.
“l‘ve seen stuff before where
poets are accompanied by
music, but this is the poets
working with the musicians. lt’s
a synthesis, a conversation
between the people reading and
the people playing.”

Prairie agrees. “[The musi-
cians and poets were] sharing
energy. I think the synthesis of
the music and poetry is syner-
9y.”

“Working with the musicians
brings back a sense of improvi-
sation and creation to the
works,” Ahl said of the collabo-
ration.

Why has this coffeehouse and
lit scene erupted like popcorn in
the nooks and crannies of the
‘Burgh and filled up entire blurbs
on MTV? Jello, who besides fre-
quent slamming, organized a
spoken word and music collabo-
ration with poet Christina
Springer and the band Marble
Cat in February, says that the
scene now “provides a forum
which was never presented
before  it’s becoming alright to
try a different thing.” _

“You never know what you're
going to hear,” says Ringler. “lt’s
really personal. Things about
being alive, being human, that
you don't see on TV or MTV. lt’s
less censored. Unexpected. It
might be something disturbing
or something beautiful.”

The future of this scene is
equally unpredictable, and even
the dreamers hesitate to dream
too hard. Carroll smirks that the
recent events have been “a cou-
ple of unfortunate accidents. It's
a trend, but it won’t evolve
because nothing ever does.”

Liz Ahl says she has a “fanta-
sy" of poets and musicians all
around the city coming together
in a spirit of love and creativity,
but, as she says, ‘‘I’m a gradu-
ate‘ student in English. I don’t
quite have my finger on the
pulse of the scene. Almost. I
have my finger on the elbow.”

“At some point it has to
plateau,” said Ringler. “There’s
a limit to how many people want
to hear poetry. I’m surprised at
all the people who are there.... It
might be too eclectic or too
avant garde or too vulgar when
talking about certain things. It's
not gonna be Pink Floyd. That
would be terrible!”

With people everywhere
cringing and whimpering at the
mere mention of high art and
running from categorization like
terrified extras in a 1950s mon-
ster movie, what do you call this
newgenre of music and poetry
carving itself into the literary
landscape (or maybe not)? ‘‘I
really don’t know quite what to
call it,” Ringler said. “lt’s not per-
formance art. lt’s really a meld-
ing of poetry and music. It’s the
spirit of the Beats, but it’s not.
beat at all.”

And it’s true. I’m as cynical as
anyone when I see black-clad,
pony-tailed Cappio commercial
candidates trying to be beatniks,
talking about how copacetic the
bongos sound. Far out. But
there is a prevailing hypersensi-
tivity to cheese, it seems, and a
new generation of poets is
doing everything it can to keep
things real, do something new,
something that refuses to be
bottled. Maybe that’s why it also
refuses to be named. The new
poetry respects the past by not
trying to imitate it, just borrow its
energy, its passion, the con-
stants that people who create
necessarily share. Or maybe I’m
just talking out my ass. Does it
matter? Probably not.

“Either we are garrulous and
complaining or short-writ and
enigmatic; but I don’t think we
make sense. Take this as gar-
rulity. If I thought writing you a
1000 page letter would answer
enigmas, either mine or yours, I
would sit down with quill and
scroll and scribble furiously.” '

-Allen Ginsberg to Neal
Cassady, May 20, 1949
