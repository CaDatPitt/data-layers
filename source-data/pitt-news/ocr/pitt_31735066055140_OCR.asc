Pitt's ”doctorof disaster” is In

By Beth Fisher
Staff Writer

The University of iPittsburgh’s Dr. Audrey
Murrell knows disaster. In~the past few years,
she’s dealt with numerous fires, evacuations
and, most recently, the ﬂood of ‘96. One might
think she’s had quite a streak of bad luck or that
she’s been in the wrong place at the wrong time
‘on one too many occasions.

Not so.

Dr. Murrell chooses to do this. An associate
professor of business administration and‘psy-
chology, sheis also a volunteer member of the
American Red Cross’ disaster action team.

As such, ‘Dr. Murrell is on-call for the Red

Cross several nights each month as a public p

affairs specialist. When disaster strikes, she
provides the media with updated information,

sets up linkages with groups like the Salvation
Army and controls access of information to
protect the privacy of victims in shelters. In
addition, she does damage assessments, coordi-
nates volunteer efforts and helps to setup ser-
vice centers for the victims.

These responsibilities often require the pro-

fessor to "work long hours into the night. She

spent the majority of the weekend of the recent
ﬂood, for instance, at the Red Cross chapter on
the Boulevard of the Allies. ,

But these long hours don’t seem to faze the
professor. 3 ' ‘ ‘

“It’s a nice feeling,” said Murrell. “You
might be tired at four o’clock in the morning
giving service to a family, but if you weren’t
there those people might not have a place to
stay that night.”

Vivarin advertisements are
no longer the only things
admonishing students to
“Stop Sleeping with Your
Professors.”

A subcommittee of Pitt’s
Task ‘Force on Sexual
Harassment is drafting a new
policy toward consensual

relationships between faculty ,

members and the students
they teach. _ .

The drafted policy will pro-
hibit relationships between
faculty members, including
teaching assistants, and stu-
dents under their supervision
by making it the responsibili-
ty of the faculty member “to
avoid sexual relationships
with or making sexual over-
tures to students over whom
they are in a position of
authority by virtue of their

,_ ,s_pe<:_i_ﬁc teac_li_ing,.__research or

administrative assignments.”
In short, no relationship
between a faculty member
and a student whose work is
graded or supervised by that
faculty member is to be
allowed. The new policy
states that faculty members in
such situations must remove
themselves from any deci-
sions concerning the student.
“We’re making sure that the
student-faculty relationship is
not corrupted in any way, or
compromised would be a bet-
ter word,” Gerald Massey,-the
subcommittee chair, said.
The old policy did “not
prohibit relationships
between consenting adults,”
but it did stateqthat personal

SEAC   rallies to save Cove
and Mallard National Parks

By Russ Krebs
Staff Writer

Imagine a roadless area the size of -Ohio..Can’t_ibe possible,

can it? Well, it is located in Idaho and called the Cove
National Park and Mallard National Park.

These two parks are connected and make up the largest
untouched area of land in the country, The only problem is
that the National Forest ‘Service is selling off parts of it to

‘ lumber companies as we speak. - .

The Student Environmental Action Coalition is trying to
help stop this. SEAC is sponsoring a “Roadshow For the
Roadless” on Friday,_ Feb. 9th in Dining Room A of the
Union at 8:00 p.m. »

SEAC is hoping that this will bring the problem to the atten-
tion of the student population. _ .
The admission to this event is free. It will feature Robert

f‘Ramon” Amon, the director of the Cove/Mallard Coalition,.

and Robert Hoyt, who is an activist and musician.
.The event will consist of a slide show, speakers on the topic
and plenty of music and good times. 3
Show your support for the environment, and show up for the
show. Even if you aren’t environmentally minded, show up
and find out what the government is doing with your money.
SEAC is also planning its next “Critical-Mass.” This is

_ when it gets as many bicycle riders together as possible and

rides on the city streets.

Sounds pretty normal, but the riders block traffic to prove
the point that Pittsburgh needs bike lanes. Their theme is: “If
we had bike lanes, you’d be home by now.” .,

Ifyou are interested in this, they meet Monday nights at
8:30 p.m. in the seventh ﬂoor lounge of the Union. Come
help make biking safer for everybody.

First U.S. soldier dies in Bosnia

 WorId Events

SARAJEVO —— A U.S. soldier

was killed when he stepped on a

land mine in the U.S.-controlled
sector of northern Bosnia. He was
the ﬁrst U.S. serviceman to die in
Bosnia since the NAT O-led peace-
keeping mission began in

, December.

The soldier, whose name was
withheld pending the notiﬁcation
of his family, died shortly after the
explosion, U.S. Army officials
said The New York Times

MOSCOW —— The Russian coal
miners union suspended its two-
day nationwide strike after Prime
Minister Viktor Chemomyrdin
signed a $2.2 billion financing
package of fixed subsidies and
overdue wages for the troubled
coal industry. '

But the miners, wary of unful-
ﬁlled past government promises,
vowed to strike again if the money
is not provided by March 1, and
they threatened to aim a political
punch at Boris Yeltsin. The
Washington Post '

WASHINGTON — Despite con-
cerns about Washington’s already
tense relationship with Beijing, the

. Clinton administration has warned

China that it risks the imposition of
stiff economic sanctions in the
next few months because Beijing
has ignored previous warnings and
continues to violate a key trade
agreement signed a year ago.

The warning comes despite con-
siderable concem from some offi-
cials that prompting a confronta-
tion over China’s piracy of
American software, music and
videos could harm Washington’s
effort to defuse growing tensions
between China and Taiwan. The

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia —
Saudi authorities confirmed that
they had taken custody of a man
who was deported from Pakistan
in connection with a 1995 car-

bombing that killed five

WASHINGTON — All the play- ’

that the White House can help ease

They are receiving a simple
message from President Clinton

That message is evidently more
appealing to the Irish government

What do these things have in common? They were
answers to just a few of the many questions asked at
the Pitt Program Council’s annual College Bowl intra-
mural tournament, held Saturday morning in the
William Pitt Union.

Nine teams of four people each squared off in 10-
minute long matches in which they were asked ques-
tions from various fields of knowledge from the acade-

mic —— literature, history, science, etc. — to general
knowledge — such as popular culture, sports and
spelling.

Director of Student Activities Joe Cavalla and Tom
Misuraca, head of the PPC, read the questions.

As part of his greeting to the event, Misuraca warned
competitors that “this game can get pretty cut-throat,
so just remember that we’re all here to have fun.”

The tournament was run in a double-elimination for-
mat, with the winners’ bracket held in the Lower
Lounge of the WPU and the losers’ bracket held in the
Assembly Room. A

A team calling itself The Saul Kripke Experience
defeated all comers to take the winners’ bracket, and a
team known as Secretariat overcame an early loss to
win the losers’ bracket. The Saul Kripke Experience
answered two 25-point questions with less than a
minute to go to break a tie in the final game and win
the tournament. ,

The Saul Kripke Experience consisted of senior Gene
McLaughlin, sophomores Justin Jureller and Jenny

Student educated at 35,000 feet

By Katie Delaney
For The Pitt News

(This is the second part of an
occasional series on Pitt
senior Katie Delaney ’s trip to
Ireland) ‘

Finally, after our four-hour
delay, filled with chit-chats in
an attempt to get to know one
another, the time had come
for all 50 of us to board the
plane for Ireland.

Although I was amazed at
how genuinely interested
everyone seemed to be in one
another on the ground, the
roles reversed when we final-
ly boarded the plane and I
met the-lad sitting next to me,
Steve, who is also with the
Beaver College program.

Less than 10 minutes into

0 the six-hour ﬂight it became

apparent that the stewardess-
es could make good quid
(Irish slang ‘ meaning
“bucks_”) if they charged me
rent for use of the toilet.
Steve was kind enough to
switch seats with me so I’d
have the convenience of
being on the aisle in case I
needed to.make a mad dash.
But even better than trading
seats was our exchange of
words that followed.

Steve promised to cure my
motion sickness by talking

me through the flight and

showing me pictures of his
family and his closest friends-
from home. He pulled his
wallet from his carry-on bag
and started chatting away
about high school proms,
Halloween dances,’ his sister
who livesiin Dublin  and
then he told me, with tears
welling in his eyes, about his
father. .
A building exploded while
he was on the job, and, as a
result of not escaping in time,

his body was.80 percent “

burned. After his father had
been hospitalized for six
months, seven-year-old Steve
could finally visit his dad.

But when he arrived at the-

hospital room, he looked past
his dad’s bed, searching for a
familiar face. The scarred,
disfigured’ man lying in the
hospital bed before him, the
only patient in the room, was
by no means a familiar face.

Eventually Steve’s‘father
returned home, but the sever-
ity of the burns left his hands
curled. He was therefore
unable to do most things.
When he asked Steve to wash
his back for him because he
couldn’t grasp the soap,
Steve, naturally at that age,
was repulsed by his dad’s
wrinkled skin and said no, he
didn’t want to touch him.

One day when Steve’s dad
was out for a walk by the
lake, he “slipped” in. He’d
never learned to swim, and
his condition prevented him
from being able to stay
aﬂoat. '

Although I hadn’t touched '

ground in Ireland,‘my educa-
tion continued as I was

reminded of the most impor-
tant aspect in life: people and
the relationships we establish
with those around us. My
conversation with Steve
rekindled my belief that the
interest we take in others —
the asked question, _the
shared story, the friendly
mannerism — matters
because it gives substance to
the moment, it directs the
future, and ultimately, if we
think about what we learn, it
reintroduces us tojthe most
human part of ourselves, the
soul. Text books, documen-

taries and classroom lectures
don’t teach it all, just as stan-
dard tests, pop quizzes and
intellectual debates don’t test
it all. None of these means,
though mandatory and cer-
tainly helpful for all of us at
some stage of life, require the
fundamental knowledge, the
most significant knowledge
of all, and that’s how we get
on with others. Within the
first 12 hours of my three-
and-a-half month journey, I
was back to the basics and
thankful to find others who
were too.

relationships should not inter-
fere with academic or profes-
sionalrelations in the universi-
ty. In the past, the policy con-
sidered "sexual relations
between a teacher and his or
her student or between a
supervisor and his or her
employee to be extremely
unwise,” but it did not actually
prohibit the relationship from
existing.

“Clearly, they [the Task
Force members] thought that
the past policy was not
enough,” Massey said.

So why wasn’t the old poli-
cy good enough?

“[The new drafted policy]
didn’t grow out of a particular
action on campus. Many of
our complaints on sexual
harassment deal with consen-
sual relationships. I would say
that many complaints on con—
sensual relations come from
other students. They view that
that person is going to get
extra stuff, that it’s not fair. Of
course, I don’t want to imply
that a great number of this
happens on campus. We do
need to respond to student
complaints about consensual

relationships going on in their

classes,” Elizabeth Baranger,
vice provost and chair of the
Task Force, said.

A student could take a
course taught by a professor
with whom he or she had a
relationship. However, that
professor would not be the one
responsible for grading that
student’s work.

The implications of the
drafted policy apply to more
than just students and faculty
members. Anytime that there
is a supervisory relationship,
the supervisor would have to
remove him or herself from
evaluating the other person.

“It’s not supposed to forbid
relationships,” Baranger said.

The original draft put forth
by the subcommittee and pub-
licized in December has also
met'with criticism. The draft
policy came under fire in an
opinion piece in the University
Times for interfering with
“healthy human relationships.”

The Pitt News received an
anonymous letter complaining
that the draft policy violates
the privacy and freedom of
students and faculty members.
The letter was also concerned
with the implications of giving
so much power to student

complaints about the “unfair
advantages” that the letter
claims are part of every insti-
tution.

Parts of the policy are also
being argued within the com-
mittee itself. There is disagree-
ment about what action will be

_taken against faculty members

who fail to remove themselves
from the evaluation of a stu-
dent with whom they are
involved. The members agree
that such action would be
unethical but disagree on the
sanctions the faculty member
would be open to.

The committee is also trying
to reach an agreement about
the status of relationships
within a department where
neither participant supervises
the other.

So, where do things stand

‘right now?
i “The draft that has been

publicized had been discussed
[by the subcommittee]. If
there’s a new draft, it will be
circulated ——not just to the
faculty, but the students as
well,” Massey said.

The subcommittee members
hope to have a new policy in
effect before the end of the
semester.

SEAC

°From page 3

described the organization.

SEAC is a relatively new
student organization here at
Pitt, existing for only four
years. It consists of 40
members, about 20 of whom
are consistently active.
Their main concern is obvi-
ously the environment.

An environmental concern
is what actually started the
group at Pitt.

Four years ago, Pitt was
considering giving money
to the University of
Arizona’s Mt. Graham tele-
scope fund. This may have
been good forfurthering
astronomical research, but it
was a terrible one for the
environment, according to
SEAC members.

SEAC believes that build-
ing this telescope would

hand to support the mem-
bers. An unknown band
called Rusted Root was the
highlight.

Pitt’s chancellor at the
time, Dennis J. O’Conner,
was also a target of some of
the members’ protest.

A few SEAC members
took it to extremes by hold-
ing a sit-in in the chancel-
lor’s office, holding out
until they had to be
removed by the police.
Their reason was that they
had tried to meet with the
chancellor for over a year
and a half to discuss his
support of Mt. Graham and
he kept “blowing them off.”

But not all of the SEAC
activities are this drastic.
They have made it their
goal to clean up Schenley
Park. They try to make it

—Mike Kaizar
SEAC member SEAC is

also respon-

and unstable concept that
violated both environmental
and religious laws.

Rachel Yudell, a first
semester senior, joined
SEAC because of the Mt.
Graham project. She was
walking by the SEAC table
and signed their petition

"against Pitt’s support of this

project. When she left, she
thought she was passing up

a good thing, so she went-

back and spent the next 48
hours with the group.

Yudell said she likes the‘

feeling of being involved in
something important. “I

enjoy the sense of making a‘

difference. This is the only
organization I’ve been
involved in to make ‘an
impact on my life.’’

In protest of Pitt’s pro-
posedsupport of the Mt.

Graham telescope, SEAC ’

held many activities. The
most notable of these was
the camp—out and concert on
the Cathedral lawn. A few
hundred students wereon

_notice.

sible for the initiation of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
recycling policy.

“We noticed that people at
Pitt were not recycling, so
we went up to the housing
director’s office and asked
him why,” said Kaizar.

The response that they got
was that the students were
too lazy to recycle. When
they emptied his trash can
on his desk and separated it
for him, the director took
SEAC now has
monthly meetings with the
-facilities manager to discuss
recycling.

Kaizar said, “We are not
afraid to take the extra step
to make a point. That’s why
we get things done.” .

If you aren’t afraid to take
the extra step and want a
place that you “fit in,”
SEAC is the place for you.

It was actually Dr. Murrell’s

teams,‘teamwork and the use
of teams to handle disaster ser-
vices,” said Murrell, who has
been formally involved with
the organization for about a
year now.

The professor’s informal

contact with the organization
can be traced back to her
brother, who works with both
the Chicago chapter and the
national network of the Red
Cross. Murrell often lent him a
hand in providing assistance to
disaster victims while she was
in town visiting.

“He encouraged me to get
involved with the chapter here
in Pittsburgh,” said Murrell,
who is originally from
Chicago.

Much of Dr. Murrell’s expe-
rience with the Red Cross is
also relevant in her teaching.

“It provides a nice example
when I talk about teams in the

classroom,” said Murrell.

“I start off by talking about
the Red Cross and how the
team approach really works
there, how if you have a clear
purpose and everybody has a
good understanding of what
that is, how effective the team
concept can be,” she said.

Dr. Murrell has been at Pitt
for about nine years. The pro-
fessor taught in the psycholo-
gy department before moving
over to the business school in
1989.

She is a graduate of Howard
University, where she did
undergraduate research
through the National Institute
of Mental Health. Before
doing’ her doctorate work in
psychology at the University
of Delaware, she spent some
time working for the American
Psychological Association.

In the research she has done
over the years, she has studied
such things as social groups
and the career issues facing
women.

“My interest is strongest in A
research,” Murrell explained.

“It’s the opportunity to bring
current research into the class-
rooms and to get students
reactions and input that stimu-
lates further research ques-
tions.”

Opinions
What's it really worth?

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pitt is “considering a
reduction in out-of-state students’ tuition.” This year’s bill for
out-of—staters passed the $11,000 mark (not including mandatory
fees. room or board). Even worse, out-of-state students are not
eligible for PHEAA grants unless their home state accepts
Pennsylvania grants at its state schools.

And then we wonder why recruitment and student retention at
Pitt is low. Big mystery.

Pennsylvania state-funded schools all fall around the $5000
mark for in—state students and $10,000 for out-of-state students.
This just includes undergraduate tuition rates for general educa-
tion. Nursing and pharmacy students pay even more per year and
can probably expect an extra yeartacked on to the normal four-
year degree. A little bit of general math (that you don’t even have
to pay for) tells you that a degree from Pennsylvania is running
anywhere around $25,000 to $50,000 these days.

In comparison, many schools in other states have tuition rates
which attract much larger applicant pools. When given the choice
between two different schools, one at $4,000 out-of-state tuition

-. and one at $5,000 in—state, which would you pick? These num-

bers are not exact, but there are many schools (particularly in the
South) which have cheaper out-of-state tuition than Pitt’s in-state
rates. Many of those schools are ranked in the top 25 colleges in
the nation. .

Pitt needs to do more than just consider lowering out-of-state
rates. If this school really is concerned with increasing admis-
sions and retainment beyond freshman year, Pitt needs to lower in
AND out-of-state rates. '

The official non-policy

Remember when, two years ago, Pitt was- shut down for the
ﬁrst time in 300 or so years? It was about 20 degrees below zero,
and many of us crawled out of bed, took our blankets with us and
stumbled off to class. Then Governor Casey, noticing that it had
begun to get a little chilly out (not to mention anelectricity short-
age around the state), determined that maybe we shouldn’t have
to be out in that kind of weather. He placed Pennsylvania in a
state of emergency, and the university shut down.

But even though the school shut down in the middle of the day,
many professors and students _hadn’t heard about it and they
showed up for classes anyway. So to avoid this problem, the
school issued an official non—policy regarding bad weather: It is
now, technically, up to your own discretion. .

Well, it may be “up to us,” but most professors probably won’t
buy that as an excuse when you didn’t turn your paper in on time
or show up for an exam because your car ‘didn’t start. On the
staff ’s side of things, a lot of bosses aren’t going to care if you got
stuck in the Squirrel Hill tunnel when your car broke down
because it was two degrees and your gas line froze. You’ll still be
docked a day’s pay. . 5 ’

When the weather is severe enough to cause frostbite in 3.2
milliseconds, it’s too dangerous for anyone — faculty, staff or
student -— to be outside. . -

Disposing of "Os" garbage

I was talking to a friend of
mine the other day, and he was
tellingme about one of his
classes. In this class, the profes-
sor was explaining how the gap
between the rich and poor grew
during the 1980s, and Ronald
Reagan’s policies were largely
to blame for this trend. (Imagine
that —+ a liberal Pitt professor!) I
have already written an article
in defense of Reagan, but I need
to shed some more light on the
“evil l980s” garbage. I also
need to address anti-wealthy

sentiments in general. ' ‘

The lower classes were per-
haps the greatest beneficiaries of
the Reagan era. Families with
incomes between $10,000 and

$50,000 peryear experienced a‘

higher percentage of net growth

’ than those in the top one-fifth

income group. More people
who were in the bottom fifth‘
income bracket in 1979 made it
all the way to the top than
stayed in the poorest group.
Certainly, a look at the numbers
indicates that during the 1980s,

.a rising tide raised all boats.

It is also interesting to exam-
ine the progress of the wealthy
during the Carter administra-
tion. During that time, only the
income of the top one percent
grew. This is odd, considering
that when Reagan took office,

the top marginal tax rate was’70 .

percent, but when he left office,
the top rate was only 28 (percent.
Even more intriguing is the fact
that the wealthy paid a greater
share of income taxes as a per-

centage of their income, com- '
pared to other income groups, at

the end of Reagan’s administra-
tion. _
Confused‘? Let me try to
explain. Although it is hard to
see exactly how wealth is creat-
ed, it is likely that rich people
are going to find a way to make
their money despite crushing
federal taxes. This held true dur-
ing the Carter years. During
Reagan’s years, the wealthy,

being the primary employers in -
any economic system, were able

    

Ma
Mills

to create more jobs and growth, .
thus allowing lower classes to
grow faster than many of those
who were already afﬂuent. In
addition, the lowering of the tax
rate helped the lower classes the
most, as they enjoyed the largest
percentage of Reagan’s taxcut.
It seems that over 200 years
after Adam Smith’s “invisible
hand” theory, we are still seeing
the ability of theaffluent to cre-
ate wealthfor the whole econo-
my. It is no surprise that efforts
to “soak the rich” always back-
ﬁre on the lower classes.

We are now in the middle of
another anti-wealthy assault
from the left. Everything
Republicans do is labeled as
“for the benefit of the wealthiest
Americans.” When Al Gore
tried to scare us about cuts in
student aid, who was going to
get that money from’
Republicans‘? When Congress
tried to slow the growth of cer-
tain. entitlements to a meager
ﬁve percent per year, who was
going to get the tax cut?
Whenever the ﬂat tax is dis-
cussed, who gets off easy? The
rich, the -rich and the rich.

I Can any of this be proven?
No. First of all, when Al Gore
visited Pitt, the Republicans’
balanced budget wasn’t even on
the table, so how did he know
where any extra money was
going? The tax cut in the
Republicans’ budget is mainly a
$500-per-child tax credit. The
last -time I checked, wealthy
people weren’t the only people
having babies. The attacks on
the ﬂat tax are_ equally ridicu-

lous. There are a number of_ ﬂat
tax proposals, including one by
presidential candidate Steve
Forbes and an older one put

, forth by Dick Armey. Since I

don’t like Forbes, I will defend
Arrney’s proposal.

In the Ariney plan, there is an
allowance of $13,100 for an
individual, $26,200 for a mar-
ried couple, and an additional
$5,300 for each dependent
child. In other words, a family
of four earning $36,800 per year
would pay no income tax at all.
Obviously, the poor would ben-
efit greatly from this proposal.
All income above the allowance
is taxed at 17 percent, thus mak-
ing the ﬂat tax fully progressive.
For instance, a family of four
earning $50,000 would pay five
percent of its total income,
while a family making $200,000
would pay 14 percent of its
income. -

Finally, I need to address non-
political class discord. ‘Not only
are people misled regarding
political issues, but there is a
widely held view that wealthy
people are simply born wealthy,
that they never work and that
they want to abuse poor people.
Richard Gephardt, the minority
leader of the House of
Representatives, once referred
to upper-class people as “the
winners, of life’s lottery.” While
there is some truth to this state-
ment, Mr. Gephardt is clearly

trying to make it seem as though _

we have a caste system and we
need’ to punish the fortunate
people in our system.

I agree that it is easy to dislike
people who wear fur coats to’
football games, constantly talk

about golf and collect Vintage." 1

wine. However, such people are
absolutely vital to a successful
economy. The creation of
wealth by the upper classes

«always spreads throughout the

economy. When. the rich get
richer, the poor get richer too.

golf or expensive wine.

ust as there was no joy in
JMudville when Mighty

Casey struck out, there is
even more unhappiness run-
ning rampant in Pittsburgh
now that the beloved Steelers
fell to the hands of the
Cowboys last week in Super V
Bowl XXX. It’s understand-
able that fans will look for
excuses when their beloved
team falls, but thelocal
yokels have gone too far.

For the first time in recent
memory, the Super Bowl
wasn’t over by halftime -— D
even though it should have _
been -— and the natives were
restless all throughout the
second half. But as we all
watched on that fateful
Sunday, the Steelers blew it.
No ifs, ands or buts. They
didn’t walk the walk.

As in any loss, it’s tough to
swallow at first. I could just
picture Steeler fans cursing
at their TV sets when
Michael Irvin and Deion
Sanders did their postgame
"interviews. OK, some bitter
feelings towards these guys
are understandable, but when
are the lousy excuses going
to end?

There was the obvious
complaint that the Steelers
totally outplayed the
Cowboys and Kevin
Greene’s comments about
the Pittsburgh domination of
~“America’s Team.”

Time out, fellas. The only

all day was cover the spread.

Blowout City
No. 6 Villonovo  

gives Pitt its worst loss
in Big East history

By_Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

VILLANOVA, Pa — The Panthers forged across the state
with an impending snowstorm over their heads but then
forgot to show up for their basketball game. Jekyll and
Hyde showed up in their place, and the result was a demor-
alizing 88-55 rout Saturday at the hands of All-American
Kerry Kittles and the Villanova Wildcats at duPont
Pavilion.

Pitt (9-9 overall, 4-6 Big East) was outplaying the num-
ber No.6 team in the country for most of the first half and
was leading for the first 17 minutes. But after a Vonteego
Cummings’ foul on a deep 3—pointer by Villanova guard
Alvin Williams with 3:05 to go in the half, the Panthers
lost the lead. Enter Hyde.

The Wildcats (18-3, 9-2), up by four at the break,
outscored Pitt 51-22 in the second half. They shot 58 per-
cent from the floor, while Pitt shot a dismal 27 percent. But
in the end, it didn’t matter who was on the floor for the
Panthers, because Kittles played liked the NBA lottery pick
many say he will be in June. -

“When Kerry plays like that we usually don’t lose,” said
Villanova Head Coach Steve Lappas, who played every
Wildcat in the romp, all but two of them scoring.

Even with the lead the Panthers maintained in the first
half, which reached as high as eight, Pitt played with some
tentativeness, missing passes and layups early on.

And the Panthers’ nervousness, addedjto the pressure of .

trying to slow down Kittles, equaled disaster.

“They were playing on a totally different level as far as

intensity was concerned,” Pitt HeadCoach Ralpli. Willard
said. “They took over in the second half, and our intensity
just fell of a clif .” _

Kittles, the reigning Big East Player of the Year, scored
31 points on ll-for—l9 shooting and grabbed six rebounds.
He also excelled defensively, moving all over the floor in
the Wildcats’ roving zone. When Lappas finally took out
his star shooting guard with under three minutes to go, the
sold-out crowd roared a standing ovation on national tele-

|anova's Kerry Kittles scorches the Panthers for 31

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

VILLANOVA, Pa. -— Prior to Saturday's
tipoff between Villanova and Pittsburgh,
Wildcat Coach Steve Lappas -honored All-
American Kerry Kittles with a game ball
commemorating the scoring of his 2,000th
career point.

Last Monday night, he scored 26 points
in leading the ‘Cats over Syracuse and
moved into sixth place on Villanova’s all-
time scoring list with 2,019.

His 31-point performance on Saturday
led ‘Nova to an 88-55 win against Pitt,
and his name jumped up to third with
2,050.

“When Kerry plays like this, we usually.
do not lose,’_’ Lappas said. “That’s some-

_ thing special.”

Kittles, sporting his customary one sock
high, one sock low came out in the first
half showing off his versatility while
scoring the team’s first four points. After
Pitt’s Vonteego Cummings drove through
the lane for a layup, Kittles countered at
the other end with a straight—on 16-footer.
Then he came back and scored underneath
on a pass from Jason Lawson, giving the
‘Cats an early 4-2 lead.

Pitt started off the game showing no
signs of being intimidated and hung close

with the ‘Cats through most of the first
half. The Panthers switched from man-to-

keep Kittles from finding his touch.

He ended up shooting five-of-ll for 13
points in the first half.

“I didn’t know they were switching
defenses; we just wanted to be aggres-
sive,” Kittles said.

Kittles’ other baskets of the half came
when Vi1lanova’s defense sprang him for
two open dunks. Alvin Williams picked
off a pair of errant Panther passes and just
tossed the ball upcourt for Kittles to catch
up to. He ended the plays with monster"
jams which got the fairly maligned crowd
back into the game.

“Our defense got transition baskets for
us,” Kittles said. “And offensively we

wanted to be aggressive against their

defense.”

But Kittles’ biggest shot of the half was
his final one. At the 3:37 mark, just one
minute after senior forward Eric Eberz
left the game with a back injury from hit-
ting the floor on a hard Gerald Jordan foul
and with Pitt leading 28-24, Kittles spot-
ted up and hit a 3-pointer from the right
wing to bring the ‘Cats within one.

“He did a great job of stepping up his
intensity when Eberz went down,” Pitt
Coach Ralph Willard said.

Then Williams cameright back 30 sec-
onds later and hit a 3-pointer of his own
to give the ‘Cats a 30-28 lead. They ended
the half leading 37-33. '

“I told these guys-they’ve just got to
attack,” Lappas said. “Kerry and Alvin
did that.” "

ation of Pitt’s women is soccer team.)

9 In 1972, President Nixon passed Title IX into law. Title IX called
for sex equity in athletic programs across the country, which meant
that if half of the undergraduate enrollment were female, then half
of the athletic program had to be for females as well.

Title IX was supposed to solve most of the sex-discrimination -

problems arising in schools throughout the country. However, 23
years later, Title IX, and its lack of sex-equity enforcement, is once
again a major issue. p - I j ’

According to a poll by- USA Today, 85 out of the 95 polled
schools failed to pass the Title IX test. Pitt was one of the schools
not in compliance with Title IX.

Pitt wasn’t in compliance with Title IX because while it had a 50
percent female undergraduate ratio, it only had eight female sports,
as opposed to ll male sports. Due to its failure in complying with
Title IX, Pitt has to make some changes in its athletic program.

‘Back in .1974-75 when Title IX was introduced, Pitt added
women’s ﬁeld hockey to comply with the law, Senior Associate

Athletics Director_Carol Sprague said.

Since then, not much has been done to change Pitt’s program.

“I’m not sure over 20 years that there was a great deal of energy
put towards helping,” Sprague said. “There’s not much interest in
expanding.”

- However, with the latest interest in assuring that Title IX accom-
plishes what it’s supposed to, there’s been a call for change in a lot

of schools throughout the country. Pitt is one of those schools.

Pitt has answered the call and has added women’s soccer to its
athleticprogram. The women’s soccer team will begin playing in
the fall of the 1996-97 school year. I ‘

Upon adding women’s soccer, Pitt’s athletic program dropped
men’s tennis and men’s gymnastics. Pitt now has nine female sports
and nine male sports. The change puts Pitt in compliance with Title
IX. »
Oval Jaynes, Pitt’s director of athletics, said that the men on
scholarship for tennis and gymnastics will still receive their schol-
arships, even though their sports were dropped.

Sprague said that since the arrival of Jaynes, Pitt has been i

reviewing its athletic program in terms of equality.

“Now it’s, time to recognize "a growing interest,” Sprague said.
“We’re trying to do that by adding women’s soccer.”

The idea for a women’s soccer team at Pitt developed because of
the results of a survey issued to Pitt students. ,

“A survey of students showed a great interest. in women’s soc— '

cer,” Jaynes said. s
After receiving the results,- Pitt decided to alter its program and

add women’s soccer since the students showed so much interest in —

lt.

Pitt men’s soccer coach Joe Luxbacher said, “Women’s soccer is
the fastest growing sport at the collegiate level. It’s a very popular
sport right now.” I

‘ There are those who believe soccer is currently the fastest grow-
ing women’s sport, but they also feel it’s about time women’s soc-
cer got the recognition it deserved. "

Baldwin High School’s girl’s soccer Head Coach John Sumoski
agreed. . _ ‘ '

“People are finally starting to realize this area is good for girl’s
soccer,’.’ Sumoski said. “For women in this area, ‘soccer is on the
move.” _ ' -

Amy Yokel,-a Pitt student and’ 13-year veteran soccer player,

thought the women’s soccer team was long overdue. ' V

“It’s about time,” Yokel said. “A school as big as Pitt should have
one.” V A
Pitt is now taking the necessary steps in adding women’s soccer.
However, just likeany other new project in the works, women’s
soccer is going to take a lot of time and cooperation to be success-
ful. 5
, One of the ﬁrst issues Pitt _had to consider was ﬁnding a facility
for the women’s soccer team. Just like any other sports team,’ it‘
would need a ﬁeld for practice and home games. A '
Luxbacher said the biggest problem was facilities. Along with
women’s soccer, there would be men’s soccer, baseball and football
all needing a place to practice and play.
Sprague said Pitt was limited due to space and the availability of
its facilities. She went on to say that it needed to assign locker

space, office space and ﬁeld space + all of which would take some V

car_eful planning.
Another major problem was funding. A ,
“Budgets are constantly being shaved,” Luxbacher said. .
“Finances play a big part.” _ A

remaining, giving Lehigh six team points
as opposed to the three it would have
earned from a win by decision.

, Pitt’s John Richey dominated his 134-
pound match, but he made one mistake
that would come back to haunt his team.
Leading 11-3 with five seconds to go
the match, Richey let his opponent have a
one-point escape to make the score 11-4.
The seven-point victory gave Pitt three
team points, but had Richey not given up
the escape, he would have earned a major
decision (a victory by eight points or
more), which would have been worth four
points for the team.

Pitt also lost several bouts that
Stottlemyer hadn’t planned on losing.
Brett Gould took Lehigh’s Marat
Vigdorchik to overtime at 150 pounds, but
Gould lost 8-6 in the sudden death period.
The _result didn’t look that bad on paper,
but Stottlemyer was blunt in his assess-
ment of the match. a

“We had no business losing that 150
match,” he said.

Bryan Matusic, who has been one of the
Panthers’ more reliable performers this
season, was defeated in convincing fashion
at 177 pounds. The 5-2 setback was anoth-

‘ er one that Stottlemyer wasn’t expecting.

“Matusic’s had a good season. He just
didn’t show up against Lehigh,”
Stottlemyer said’

In the ﬁnal two bouts of the meet, 190-
pounder Mark Bodo won a 9-6 decision,
and heavyweight Pat Wiltanger pinned his
opponent with only 13 secdnds left in the
match, but their efforts left Pitt one point
short of a win.

“We had plenty of opportunities to win.
We just couldn’t catch a break. There were
times when the oﬂicials didn’t help either,”
Stottlemyer said. “I wouldn’t put the
blame on J .J . or anyone else. It wasn’t one
thing that cost us the match. We win as a
team and lose as a team.”

Pitt got its share of winning as a team on
Saturday at Duquesne. In their first match,
the Panthers faced George Mason. Once
again, Stevens got Pitt off to a quick start
at 118 pounds, pinning his opponent 32
seconds into the third period. Ziska also
pinned his opponent, giving Pitt a 12-0
lead after two bouts. That turned out to be

sure of revenge for their performances on
Wednesday, winning their matches 13-6
and 12-4, respectively.

Another injury may have cost Pitt anoth-
er bout. Jacob Schaus was also out, and his
replacement at 158 pounds, Marc Johnson,
was pinned with 15 seconds left in the
match.

“Jake had some discomfort in his chest.
He saw a doctor and had some blood
tests,” Stottlemyer said. Schaus is expected
to retum to action today.

Pitt won by forfeit at 167 pounds, and,
like Fasnacht and Gould, Bryan Matusic
also helped make up for his loss earlier in

all the points Pitt needed. the week with a 7-6 decision. Bodo and

his opponents. Before this season, he had
only one pin in his career. This season, he

has ﬁve.

“When Pat gets an inferior opponent, he
goes for the pin now,” Stottlemyer said.

“'Il1at’s critical in a dual meet, because you '

need to win two bouts to make that up.”
In a considerably tougher match, the
Panthers faced Duquesne later in the after-

noon.

Stevens had his hot streak cut short by
Duquesne’s Charlie Seibert. According to
Stottlemyer, Seibert’s 8-5 decision was the
result of a hesitant attack from Stevens.

“He just didn’t go at it. He was shut
down halfway through the match,”
Stottlemyer said.

At 134 pounds, Lengle was once again
dominated, losing to Eric Newill by pin
just 25 seconds into the match.

Z_iska and Fasnacht each won major
decisions, 16-5 and 14-4, so Pitt was down
by only one point, 9-8, after four matches.
At 150 pounds, Gould was trailing by one
point with three seconds left in the match
when he scored a takedown to pull out an
8-7 victory.

At 158 pounds, Stottlemyer tried his
third wrestler in as many matches, this
time inserting Brian Pardini into the line-
up. On the scoreboard, the decision didn’t
pay off, as Pardini lost a 6-5 decision, but
Stottlemyer liked what he saw. ’

“He wrestled tough. Even though he
lost, he took the kid right to the end,”
Stottlemyer said. '

Pitt then took the lead for good behind
Joel Giroski’s performance at 167 pounds.
Giroski won his match by medical default
to make the score 17-12. ‘

“Giroski got his legs up on top and then
just turned him over. He got three points
for a near fall. Then when he did it again,
the guy was just hurt too bad to continue,”
Stottlemyer said. ,

V Matusic won by fall midway through
the third period of the 177-pound match to
make the score 23-12, and then Bodo and
Wiltanger continued their dominance, each

having a hard time swallow-
ing a bitter loss.

OK, maybe Brown did get
lucky, but isn’t luck a part of
the game? Over 750 million
people watched this game,
including myself, and we all
saw Neil O’Donnell loft two
gifts to Brown, so why is he
to blame? Why aren’t more
people pointing the finger at
O’Donnell or the receivers
who ran their patterns like
they were drawn in the dirt
and who didn’t understand
them because they were
upside down?

Maybe they were so
enthralled by the heroic play
of the silent star Levon
Kirkland. What heroic play,
you ask? Well, it would have
to be his stifling of Emmitt
Smith and sack of Troy
Aikman on a key third—quar-
ter drive that forced the
Cowboys to punt, right?
Some locals even had the
gall to say “he was the best
player on the field in Super
Bowl XXX.” Was I watching
a different game than the
other 740,999,999 people last
week?

Granted, Levon Kirkland
played a great game, but he
was not-the best player on
the field by any means. The
truth is,Vhe was forced to
play the game of his life
because the rest of his bud-
dies didn’t even show. Those
who were warned to “Avoid_

Lloyd” didn’t have a hard
time with Lloyd on the
ground most of the game..
Poor Kevin, Greene was worn
out from Mean Gene
Okerlund’s interview in
Vegas following his cameo’
appearance on World
Championship Wrestling ear-
lier in the week. Finally,-' Rod
Woodson was too busy point-
ing to his knee after every
play and yelling, “My All-
Star Grille is better than
yours,” tomake any differ-
ence in the game.

" The.Steel Curtain sure did
play a great game, holding
the Cowboys to. 254 yards of
total offense, including a
mere 70 in the final two and
a half quarters. That’s very
impressive, but__all those don-
ning the black and gold, wav-
ing ‘their Terrible Towels and
listening the “Here We Go” '
tun_e have overlooked the
biggest stat. ‘

27-17. What does it mean
when your defense controls
the second half and you still
lose? It must really hurt to
shut down one of each of the
best QBs, running backs and
wide receivers and-sti1l give
up 27 beans. But hey, they

. sent a message to the NFC!?!

Whatever, the game’s over
and the (Steelers should take
~ the route Kevin Greene did,
because the Steelers and pro-
fessional wrestling have
something in common, nei-
ther of them are for real.

Kittles
°From page 8

Kittles, a 6-foot-5 senior guard from New Orleans and
last year’s Big East Player of the Year, came into the
game leading the ‘Cats in points (19.5), rebounding (7.0) '
and steals (2.4). g

Against Pitt alone, he’s averaging 19 points per game in
his career. Last Feb. 4, he manhandled the Panthers by
scoring 10 points in overtime to lead the ‘Cats to a come-
from-behind victory in the Field House. He finished the
game with 26 points, shooting nine-for-15 from the ﬂoor.
In the last 8:09 of the game, he scored 17.

Kittles came outin the second half and hit three 3-
pointers followed up by a drive for two points between
Garrick Thomas" and Gerald Jordan in the first 10 minutes
as the ‘Cats pulled away from the Panthers.

“The thing he does so well ‘is he’s patient,” Pitt forward
Chad Varga said. “He’s not looking to get his points.
He’ll get his points when they’re there. He moves really
well without the ball and moves off picks really well.
He’s an unbelievable talent.”

In the second half, Kittles went six-for-eight from the
field, including three—for-four from behind the 3-point

' are.

Thatfs because they reverse the ball so well.”

Kittles was the big reason the ‘Cats routed Pitt 51-22 in
the second half to pick up the victory.

Lappas finally pulled Kittles outof the ‘game at the 2:46
mark of the second half. He drove around Jason Maile for
a layup and drew a foul. Kittles hit the foul shot to finish
off the 3-point play to give Villanova an 81-50 lead.

Kittles ended the night with 31 points, six rebounds.

“We wanted to have a hand
in [Jerry] McCullough’s
face,” Lappas said. “If we
could stop him, that would
mean the younger guys would
have to step up.”

Besides McCullough’s two
treys, Garrick Thomas was the
only other Panther to connect
on a 3-pointer.

One factor behind stopping
the Panthers 3-point attack
was freshman Ce1estand’s
hustle on defense. He didn’t
start the game but was a key

,factor in shutting down tae

Panthers’ shooting, guardii g
McCullough and Cummings
for parts of the game. He also
finished with 10 points and
six assists.

Lappas played him more
because his best shooter,
senior forward Eric Eberz, left
the game midway through the
first half with a hip injury.
Eberz jumped up with Chad
Varga and Gerald Jordan for a
loose ball and crashed to the
floor. He lay‘ still for a few
minutes and was eventually
walked off the court with
Villanova medical trainers.

The Wildcats hardly missed
Eberz’s 15 points per ‘game.
Williams added 15, and power
forward Chuck Kornegay
scored 10. But Kittles was all
Villanova needed.

Before the game, the New
Orleans native was given a
game ball commemorating his
2,000 point, which he scored
earlier in the year against
Syracuse.

“He’s sopatient,” said
Varga, who had 17 points‘ and

10 rebounds, both Pitt highs. .

“We tried different things to
contain him, but he always
seemed to step it up.”
Willard said there were
many heads hanging in the
Panther locker room after the
game. It was the most lop-
sided loss since the Panthers
joined the Big East in 1982.
“This was only our second

' road game in a hostile envi-

ronment, and we haven’t fared

‘too well,” Willard said. “We

have a long way to go.”
