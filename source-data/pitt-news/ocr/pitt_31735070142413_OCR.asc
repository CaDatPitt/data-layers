SGB reﬂects on 2

Erin Block
Staff Writer

The new president and Student
Government Board members re-
ﬂected on what Chancellor Mark
N ordenberg called “the good, the
bad and the ugly” of 2009 at last
night’s inaugural SGB ceremony.
The newly elected members,
the outgoing Board members and
many student and faculty campus
leaders met in the Lower Lounge
of the William Pitt Union for the
inauguration and reception.
Those in attendance included
Nordenberg, Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey and SGB elec-

. tions chair Sarah Heisey,~who

hosted the event.

Board member Molly Stieber ‘

said she felt anxious before the
ceremony began.

“There’s a lot of work ahead,
but we’ll be a united front,” she
said.

Nordenberg thanked the re-
tiring Board, reiterating the tri-
umphs of the year, as well as “the
ugly” — citing Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl’s potential tuition tax and
the G—20 Summit aftermath.

He asked the audience to re-
member that “even in a large
and complex institution it is the
students that are at the heart of
what we do.”

Former SGB President Kevin
Morrison also addressed the audi-
ence. He said he enjoyed working
with his former board and “the
people [he] respects.”

arland Williams began
the new decade with a
murder.

“I went to a place called Mor-
ton’s Steak House and ate a lob-
ster, so I guess I started the year
by murdering,” Williams said.

Isn’t that a little extreme?

“OK, I guess I just helped in
[the lobster’s] execution,” he
said. . V

Williams, a stand—up co-
median and improv artist, will
continue his year in a slightly
more good-natured fashion by
putting on a series of shows this

weekend at Pittsburgh Improv at

the Waterfront.

' The shows will_ feature both a
stand-up set from Williams and
an improv section at the end of
the show, featuring a number of
other comedians.

f‘I tried to think of a way we
could up the ante for the shows,”
he said. “It seems like no one
really does true improv anymore
in the comedy world. Everything
is so scripted, so it’s kind of like
a bonus show.”

Williams elaborated on the
difference between his stand-
up and his improv techniques,
making sure to note that he loves
both styles equally.

Trial delayed again for accused bomb threatcaller

Liz Navratil
News Editor

The U.S. Attorneys Office once again
delayed setting a trial date for a for-
mer Pitt student accused of making
bomb threats on campus, saying of-
ﬁcials wanted more time to consider
her for an alternative program.
Louisa Ewuresi Nkrumah, who
is accused of calling in threats to the
Cathedral of Learning and Posvar

Hall in April 2008, asked the U.S.
Attomey’s Ofﬁce to consider her for
the Pre—Trial Diversion Program this
summer, according to court docu-
ments.

The program, which is designed
for ﬁrst—time offenders, gives some
defendants a chance to have their
charges dropped, said Robert Ces-
sar, the acting U.S. Attorney. People
accepted to the Pre—Trial Diversion
program work with the U.S. Proba-
tion Service to create a one-year pro-

gram that could include drug testing,
paying restitution to injured parties
or performing community service,
among. other activities, Cessar said.

He estimated that ﬁve or six peo-
ple enter the program each month
and that about 98 percent of them
successfully complete it. He said can-
didates for the program are evalu-
ated on a case-by—case basis and that
officials will consider, among other
factors, the nature of tl1e defendant’s
crime and previous criminal history,

as well as the value of the damages
resulting from the crime he or she
is accused of committing.

Cessar did not comment on Nk-
rumah’s case. Nkrumah could not

be reached for comment, nor could

her lawyer, Cynthia Reed Eddy, who
has declined to comment in the past,
saying communication between her
and her clients is conﬁdential.

The newest extension will give
Nkrumah and Eddy until Feb. 26 to
ﬁle pre-trial motions, which are any

requests that would affect the neces-
sity of atrial or the trial’s conduct.
Federal attorneys cannot set a trial
date until after the deadline for pre-
trial motions. , »

Nkrurnah spent last semester
studying at Penn State Harrisburg.
Steve Hevner, a spokesman for Penn
State Harrisburg, said he could not
confirm whether she would return to
class for the spring semester, because
the school’s classes don’t begin until
Monday.

Pigs totreat Typel diabetes

Pitt researchers look to genetically altered pig cells instead of insulin

Diana Bergan
For The_Pitt News

Pigs might provide a new treat-
ment for Type 1 diabetes, accord-
ing to one Pitt researcher. '

Genetically altered pig cells,
called islet cells, contain a speciﬁc
gene that produces the human ver-
s_ion of a protein which helps pro-
duce insulin, a substance needed to
control the body’s blood sugar.

Currently, people diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes take insulin
shots, because their bodies’ im-
mune systems destroy the cells
that produce insulin. The shots
compensate for that loss of insu-
lin.

Pitt researcher Massimo Trucco
thinks transplanting these pig cells
into humans with Type 1 diabetes
might eliminate the need for in-
sulin shots.

Trucco, whose work is spon-
sored by the U.S. Department
of Defense, said his researchers
chose to use genetically altered
pig cells‘ because of their success-

ful trials on monkeys. Therefore
he thinks the human body will be
less likely to reject the cells, as it
has rejected other cells research-
ers have tried.

He said he and his colleagues —
researchers from the Netherlands
and Australia —— transplanted the
islet pig cells into monkeys and
found that the cells worked in their
bodies for more than a year.

Previous research, which used a
different type of pig cells, showed
that the new cells would begin to
stop functioning after about a
month in both humans and mon-
keys.

Trucco said he hopes to use
the islet cells in a clinical trial on
humans.

“In the trial, we are attempting
to block the autoimmune process
that brings about the clinical onset
of the disease,” he said.

Trucco said he thinks the islet
cells might work in humans for
several reasons.

First, pig insulin is almost iden-
tical to human insulin, except for
a difference in one amino acid,

Trucco said. Second, the animal
version was used successfully for
many years to treat patients until
human insulin became available.

And third, he said pigs are simi-
lar to humans biologically and can
generate 10 to 12 piglets per preg-
nancy. The piglets grow to adult-
hood in about six months.

“Pigs don’t face the same ethi-
cal and medical restrictions for
transplant use as monkeys and
other primates do,” Trucco said.

Farms are already set up to pro-
duce many pigs. Once the appro-
priate facilities are built on those
farms, the islet cells can be used
for transplantation, Trucco said.

Pitt student Miguel Martinez,
who was diagnosed with Type 1 di-
abetes at the age of 3, said he hopes
Trucco’s solution will work. Mar-
tinez currently uses insulin pump
therapy to treat the disease.

“As a diabetic, I encourage and
support the research of new ways

v of treating diabetes,” Martinez

said. “For too long, insulin has
been the only way to treat diabe-
tes.”

The card costs $3 for students and
$5 forfaculty and staff. Students should
bringtheirPit1:IDs and the exact amount

I of cashfor registrationtotheTicketOf—
ﬁce inthe William PittUnion. When they
purchase the cards, studentswill receive
a list of participating busirressesi ad-
dresses. Tickets will be available for as
long as supplies last.

Discounts apply to restaurants and
grocery storesinoakland, SquirrelHill,
the Waterfront and the Strip District.
Highlighted business partners include
Szechuan Express and LittleAsiainOak—
land, Yongfa grocery store in the Strip
District and Hokkaido Seafood Buifet
near the Waterﬁ'ont.

Offersvaryamongbusinesses. Stu-
dentswill receiveatleast 10 percent off
theirpurchases atmorethanzo Chinese
restaurants. _

In 2008, the card was only avail-
able to Chinese Pitt students and staff,
as well as visiting scholars. The CSSA

extended the offer to all students, staff
and faculty in 2009.

Y’mg Yang, president of CSSA, said
that there is higher turnout for the card
this yearthan ever before. It is the pro-
gram’s three-year anniversary

“About 400 students have already
purchased the discount car ,” Yang
said. When the program started in
2007, the group sold between 100 and
200 cards.

Yang attributes the enthusiasm to
Pitt’s growing Chinese population and
new methods of advertising.

“We advertised through other
channels this year. Not just our e-mail
list, but also our Facebook group and
GPSA’s website,”Yang said, referring to
the Graduate and Professional Student
Assembly. Yang said that 83 percent of
buyers heard about the offer through
Facebook.

The whole process is nonproﬁt,
Yang said. The $3 and $5 charges go to
cover card—printingfees. There is no an-
nual fee for participating businesses.

Yang said CSSA borrowed the idea
for the program from the Chinese As-
sociation at the University of Illinois.

‘_‘Illinois has ahuge Chinese commu-
nity,” Yang said. “We thought it would
be a great idea to initiate the program
here.”

iPothole

This Wednesday, iBurgh — an
iPhone app for reporting “pot-
holes, graffiti and other nui-
sances to city government”
— became fully interactive, ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. The software allows us-
ers to send text messages and
photos of city problems to the
local government. No statistics
have been released regarding
how many received complaints
include portraits of Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl.

Package handling

A man was arrested for running
nude near the White House on
Wednesday, according to The
Washington Post. The paper
reports that the Secret Service
classiﬁed his bag of stripped—off
clothes as a “suspicious pack-
age.” No word on whether the
jogger was classiﬁed similarly.

N odding ‘off

For the second time in four
months, a slumbering student
was left on a Pittsburgh Public
Schools’ bus. According“‘to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the
bus driver took the sleepy ﬁrst-
grader to the school when he

saw the boy trying to open the
bus doors. We hope the boy has
recovered from his ordeal and
applaud his enterprise for falling
asleep before class began.

‘ Grammar rules!

The National Association of
Good Grammar has announced
that our current year, 2010,

A should be pronounced “twenty

ten,” and not “two thousand and
ten,” according to the San Fran-
cisco Chronicle. Apparently, we
have been pronouncing the year
wrong for a decade. Well, hind-
sight is always two -thousand and
twenty.

Condom theft

Petty criminals have broken into
hundreds of condom vending
machines in Mumbai, reports
the BBC. Installed by HIV-pre-
vention activists, these vending
machines have been damaged
by thieves looking for “fun, for
smallchange or for free con-
doms.” Activists would have in-
stalled preventive measures on
the dispensers, but the thieves
insisted that they loved the ma-

chines, that they would stay with‘ .

them no matter what happened
and that no protection was nec-

essary.

If you spend $21,765 on a new Honda
Accord, youcancustomize at least30

matic, if it comes with a ﬁrst aid kit
or not and what kind of mats are on

to build the best vehicle for you as
an individual.

A In contrast, if you spend $23,042
on a year’s out-of—state tuition to at-
tend the School of Arts and Sciences
at Pitt, you are ordered to ﬁilﬁll six
Foundational Skills Requirements
and 13 General Education Require-

v ments that include courses in the

humanities, social sciences, natural
sciences and — in a nod to leftists’
multiculturalism— “Global Citizen-
ship.”

It’s natural for the purchaser to ‘

make decisions in a business transac-
tion, but at Pitt, _we pay the University
large sums of money and then al-
low them to make momentous deci-
sions for us. After all, the gen eds and
“Foundational Skills” imposed on us
by the University amount to up to 19
required classes —- that’s four semes-

» ters of our college experience.

I can’t speak for readers, but I
came to Pitt for an education that
would beneﬁt me professionally and
personally throughout the rest of my
life, not an education that University
bureaucrats have decided will make
me a better “citizen of the world.”

The problem is that Pitt is not
alone in imposing such require-
ments on its customers/students. I

an’t simply take my money and go
to another school if I don’t like the
concept of gen eds because every
major college and university seem
to have them.

Without other educational op-
tions, I’matPitt, taking intro courses
in a subject I don’t care about simply
because the University decided that
the class is useful for me.

Besides, the issue of consumer
choice, required courses artiﬁcially
inﬂate enrollment in certain classes
and keep courses available, profes-
sors employed and departments
ﬁinctioning when there is no ac-
tual demand for them. I’ve taken a
number of classes simply to fulﬁll
a University requirement and .they
have not— with one or two excep-

tions— been of the, same quality as

the classes I’Ve taken in my major.
Instead, classes I’ve taken to fulﬁll

requirements tend to be large lec-

ture courses ﬁlled with hundreds

of students and taught without any _

discussion or participation from the

some Unconventional Wisdom

Gratuitous gratuities unacceptable

Jacob Brown
Columnist

  
 

Ah, yes, it’s the ﬁrst Friday of the se-

mester. With everyone returning to
little or no homework and with re-
plenished bank accounts, this should
be a busy weekend at local bars and
restaurants. ‘

With food and drinks inevitably
comes tipping. And inevitably, most
people do it wrong. A . g

Generally,15to20 percentofabillis
the accepted norm for atip in gratuity
etiquette. But why is there a “norm”
foranadditional costthat isn’tusually
printedonareceipt?Isayit’s more like
blackmail. ‘

When you go to a restaurant, you
expect speedy, quality service. ’I‘l1at’s
whatyou’re paying for, right? I

Not always. In November 2008 in _

Bethlehem, Pa., acouplewas arrested‘
for not paying an 18 percent built-in
gratuity on the bill. They said that the
service had been inadequate, so they

only paid for their meals and drinks.

On several occasions, I too have
been reluctant to leave a tip. At one
restaurant, upon signing the receipt,
I felt the service was so bad that not
only did I leave  goose egg on the tip
line, butI also wrote anote onthe back
of the receipt explaining why I didn’t
leave atip. Z .

For a $20 meal, I thought that my
french fries should have been served
soonerthanhalfan hour alter I men-
tioned the missing spuds to my wait-

, ress. But thatwas just one of the many
I service issues I had with that meal.

Sure, callwhat I did a bit sadistic,
but I think I helped make the world a
little better placethatnight, or at least
made this particular server better for
future customers. I’m not usually that
caustic, nor am I quite that cheap.

Ibelieve Steve Buscerni’s character,
Mr. Pink, from “Reservoir Dogs” has

the best take onthe subject: ‘.‘I don’t '

tip because society says I have to. All
right, if someone deserves atip, ifthey
really putforth an effort, I’ll give them

something extra.”

Whatl don’t getiswhen people pity
tip the poor, weary soul who labors
through the rigors of carrying food
around -— especially alter lackluster
service. That’s rewarding mediocrity.

No matter what, employers have
topay minimurnwage to their servers,
even iftheir ollicial hourly payis abase
amount like the $2.90 currently paid

,inPennsylvania. .

Another commontippingpredica-
merit comes from how to tip at a bar.
It takes a skilled bartender to make a
good drink, so a good job would natu-
rally carry a reward with it.

But if your $6 Long Island icedtea
tastes more like what gramps kept in
 ﬂask to ward offthe cold than a
proper drink, send it back and tip ac-
cordingly —- or not at all. As a paying
customer, you have that right.

When it comes to beer, though,
handing over an extra dollar because
someone removed a bottle cap or
poured beer intoa glass is a real ex-
ploitation of our generosity.

There’s a misconception that pa-
trons have to act like third graders,
handingovermoneyas ifitwere apples
to Mrs. Crabtree, to ensure attention.
Remember, bartenders should work
foryour business —— notthe otherway
around.

Alas,takingcontrolinsocial situa-
tions, whether it’s inabarorrestaurant,
has unfortunately become somewhat
taboo. Not tippingis often considered
cheap or poor form.

But rules are ﬂexible. Not tipping
on aﬁrst date might notbe agood idea,
but if you’re on your 20th date or so,
reconsiderthat rule.

Gratuity rules are so complicated _

that BBC reporterKevinConno1ly even
wrote a column explaining the intrica-
cies of tipping in the U.S. -— a custom
most Britons have never had to face.

“[Tipping] keeps whoever is doing
the serving on their toes,” he said. “I
have waited halfan hour for a receipt
in communist Poland while watching
two youngwaiters playingfootball with
a polystyrene cup.”

Connolly champions the idea, in-
troducingittohisreaders withacl1ild-
like enthusiasm. To him, tippingis the
great savior of the service industry.

In the real world, incentive has
given way to expectation. Hard work
then gave way to entitlement. And
people like me have become jaded as
to whether or not this concept really
works. _

It does, but it takes some self-con-
trolto make itworkproperly. Money is
one of the best forms of expression.

Mentioningaproblem often helps
correct it, but it’s not foolproof. Some-
times, you need to take action too.

So here’s a challenge to those of
you going outthis weekend: Use some
sense. Raise your expectations ofwhat

the word “quality” means. Say what _

you mean with your wallet

Such restraint can only make ser-
vice at our area businesses that much
better.

Renaissance Artwas fun and all, but A

In my three years at Pitt, gen eds

quality of other courses offered at

Pitt.

What’s worse is that the decision
of what to require and what not to re-

“Global Citizenship” set of require-

into this category without allowing

An important question to ask in

students at Pitt are American citizens
and would tangibly beneﬁt from a
clearer understanding of their rights

citizens.

But multiculturalism is a fad in
American education in a way that

understanding what it means to be-

an American never will be, and so
students at Pitt must take four classes

the ideologies of the University.

A As students, our time will always
be wasted by required intro classes
that emphasize the priorities of aca-
demia rather than the priorities of
the individual until higher education
is understood as a product on the
market no different than another
good or service. Indeed, we already
buy and sell education like a com-
modity in this nation, and just like

learning

often goes to the highest bidder.

It’s time to bring the buying and
selling of education out into the
open and recognize that the proper
relationship between a student and
a school is like that between a cus-
tomer and a car dealer. No more
paternalism.

Comedian forbids use of ‘gynecologist’

written beforehand. Improv is totally
off-the-cuff,” he said.

He added that the improv section
of the show will incorporate sugges-
tions from the audience.

“Just please don’t yell out ‘Gyne-
co1ogist,”’ he said.

The Harland Williams brand of
humor can be described as eclectic,
silly or just ﬂat—out weird.

“I like to talk about ridiculous
things people never really think
about,” Williams said. “Did you know

that rhinoceroses are just big, fat,

white trash unicorns?”

No, I never really thought about
it like that. ‘

“Or that broccoli is just scared
cauliﬂower?” he asked.

I suppose it is.

“I like to keep things fresh and
upbeat for people,” he said.

Williams has been to Pittsburgh,
and he praises his “large fan base.”
He conveyed his surprise about how
seriously the city’s inhabitants take
St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.

“I had a show on St. Patrick’s Day
last year, and people told me I would
be lucky to get a handﬁil of people.
But then the show came, and the place
was packed,” he said. “I love the Pitts-
burghians.”

Aside from putting on comedy
shows, Williams enjoys keeping his
funny bone in shape by pursuing
comedy in a variety of media. He au-

thored a humor book, “Things You
Don’t Know You Don’t Know,” that
was published at the end of Decem-
ber, and he started a comedy podcast
lastjuly.

“It’s called ‘The Harland Highway,’
and you can get it through my website
or through iTunes. I crank call the rest
of the planet,” he said.

Literally, Williams crank calls
random people from other countries
without a real plan for the conversa-
tion aside from perpetuating a hu-
morous reaction from his victims.

He also recounted an episode in
which he discusses the advancing
technology of baby strollers, liken-
ing them to “Transformers.”

Williams, like any rationalperson,
is skeptical of mothers transporting
their children in Optimus Prime.

He might be best known to Pitt

' students for his roles in ﬁlms like

“The Farrelly Brothers,” “There’s
SomethingAbout Mary” and “Dumb
and Dumber,”_as well as “Sorority
Boys,” in which he donned aﬂowing,
brown, mullet—like wig to assume the
role of Roberta. ’

He also plays a love interest that
Molly Shannon’s character, Mary
Katherine Gallagher, saves from
drowning in the Saturday Night Live-
inspired “Superstar.” You_know, the
silent and brooding guy in the leather
jacket.

“I liked that role because I got to

play the stud — for once,” Williams
said.

He cited the comedians from the
Chicago—based Second City comedy
troupe as some of his biggest inspira-
tions,—and he said he greatly enjoyed
Steve Martin’s early work, before he
“started getting all commercial and
doing things like ‘Father of the Bride’s
Groom’s Wedding?” ’

He also named “The Hangover” as
a comedy ﬁlm he enjoyed within the
past year, although itwas also a little
commercial for his tastes. V

“I want to say [one of the funni-

‘est movies was] ‘The Texas Chainsaw

Massacre,’ but I think that’s outside
of the year,” he said.

The series of shows promises to
provide audiences with plenty ofbelly
laughs in this drearyjanuary, and Wil-
liams gives a friendly invitation to
future audience members: ’

‘‘[People] better come to my show,
or they could be my next lobster.”

And remember, ‘gynecologist’—is
out of bounds, but ‘obstetrician’ is
completely  the realm of pos-
sibility.

Dude from “Dumb and Dumber” opens in Pittsburgh.

It’s all just a joke with Snooki and friends

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

One day over break, my mom
asked me a hypothetical question
about where I would want to go
on vacation this summer —-— the
last summer vacation I will take

before I become a “real person” .

after graduation.

I answered almost instantly and
told her that this summer, I would
want nothing more than to travel
to the Jersey Shore.

Like observing wild animals of
the Serengeti on a Kenyan safari,

I want to see in person the curi-
ous creatures by which MTV has
so proﬁted with its newest trash-
tastic reality television venture,
“Jersey Shore.” '

My inner monologue would
likely go something like this:

“Crikey! As you can see, a par-
ticularly stunning member of the
Snookius Guidetticus family is
on her way to the tanning salon
to prep for the mating ritual that
will commence this evening, as it
does every night at the local board-
walk watering holes. Notice" the
height of the ‘poof,’ or large mound
of hair, on the center of her head.

The size of the ‘poof’ is directly
related to how proud the Snookius
Guidetticus is feeling today ...”

When the previews for “jersey
Shore” started airing in Novem—
ber, I don’t think I was the only
one skeptical about the show. Guys
and girls who look like they came
straight from the “My New Hair-
cut” YouTube video, I thoughtjto
myself. No, thank you.

But then the show premiered,
and I got swept up with the rest
of the nation in Shore Fever. For
the ﬁrst time since, well, the last

season of “Real World,” the entire ‘

country was united in laughing at

a rag—tag group of reality televi-
sion misﬁts. ,

Thesekids, however,-happen to
get their kicks by ﬁst—pumping and
hair—gelling, and suddenly, MTV
has a runaway hit on its hands.

Today, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi,
Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino
and the rest of the self-proclaimed
guidos and guidetteshave captured
the pop culture heart of America.

The viewership has more than

doubled since its 1.38 million- l

viewer premiere, and the cast
seems intent on drawing out its
15 minutes of fame for as long as
possible.

Snooki and Ronnie Magro
have both admitted to having sex
tapes, though Snooki denies that
she would ever shop hers around,

A despite a projected price of up to

$3 million, as estimated by Vivid
Entertainment founder Steven
Hirsch.

Sure, Snooki will perform
thong—exposing cartwheels at a bar
and simultaneously mack on four
guys while drunk in a hot tub on
national television, but let people
see a sex tape she has already ad-
mitted to owning? Never! Part of
what makes “Jersey Shore” so ﬁin

(albeit, guiltily fun) is the response

Baldwin flick chugs
along with quality humor

Brian Pope
Staﬂ’ Writer

“It’s Complicated” -
Starring: Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin,
Steve Martin ,

Director: Nancy Meyers

Studio: Universal Studios

Grade: A-

The only complicatedlhthing about the
holiday season’s best romantic comedy,
“It’s Complicated,” is keeping a straight

The web gets even more tangled when
the architect remodeling Jane’s house,
Adam (Steve Martin), starts to develop
feelings for her.

During the course of the illicit affair,
Jane andjake ﬁnd themselves re-eva1uat-
ing the dissolution of their marriage, while
struggling to hide from their children and

. their surprisingly observant future son—in—

audience both are forced to change their
perception ofthe relationship between,

two divo rcees.

lock Holmes,” “Nine” and “The Princess
and the Frog” are definitely burying “It’s
Complicated,” but it is aygliamond that is
worth sorting through  heap for.

The humor is smart,'silly and enjoy-
able. Men need not be turned away by the
romantic comedy label, and neither should
teenagers shun the movie for its cast of
older actors. This ﬁlm has a character and
a situation for everyone to enjoy.

Academy Awa‘rd—winner Meryl Streep
is Jane, the ex—wife of Emmy Award winner
Alec Baldwin’s Jake.

Along with their two daughters, Gabby

(Zoe Kazan) and Lauren (Caitlin Fitzger-

ald), and Lauren’s fiancée Harley (John
Krasinski), the proud but separated par-
ents head to New York City for their son
Luke’s (Hunter Parrish) college gradua-
tion. After a night of heavy drinking by
both parental parties, the celebration gets
considerably hotter and heavier than ei-
ther of them anticipated.

Jane wakes up the next morning and
realizes that the man she slept with is
not only the one that she divorced ten
years ago, but also the one that has since
remarried.

Jake’s marriage to Agness (Lake Bell)
is hardly happy. Jake spends most of his
time in a fertility clinic catering to Agness’s
desire for a second child.

Best Picture and Best Actress for Streep. '
She portrays Jane as a woman believably
struggling with the guilt of her newfound
"‘other'woman” status and the simultane-
ouls reinvigoration of her sex life.

“The Ofﬁce’s” John Krasinski proves
that he is a versatile actor of the big and
small screens by milking every one of his
moments on screen for their full comic
potential.

,“It’s Complicated” may not have a $300
million budget or Penelope Cruz in a cor-
set, but it is still a worthwhile and hot
ticket nonetheless.

Grade: A-

Lady Gaga’s second album, The Fame M01zs2‘er,
will not disappoint her veteran fans.

 

The album onlyhas eight songs, butLady Gaga
(Stefani Germanotta) more than makes up for
it with plenty of personality and lots of sexually
explicit innuendos.

The highlights on the CD include Gaga’s wildly
popularﬁrstsingle “Bad Romance,”the token club
track “So Happy I Could Die” and “Telephone,”
Gaga’s collaboration with Beyoncé.

Fanscanexpectthe electronica-inspired dance
tracks that characterized The Fame but can also
lookforward to discovering otherfacets of Gaga’s
talent.

For example, “Speechless,” the only ballad of

this because Gaga wrote it as a plea to her father

it has garnered from the media. _
Italian—American groups are outraged 
the casually offensive depiction of Italiaii
heritage, citing “guide” and “guidette” as
derogatory terms‘. X‘.
Sure, they might have an etymologically
questionable past, but can’t these groups jusfyt

accept the show' and the cast as the jokes.

the rest of the country understands that
they are?

Advertisers have pulled ads left and
right, leading to this lovely statement from
Snookk

“I just have one thing to say to Domino’s,
Dell, UNICO and all the other haters out
there: F*** you! If you don’t want to watch,
don’t watch. Just shut the hell up! I’m seri-
ous  F*** you!” ,

In response, at least Domino’s proved
that it kind of getsthe joke: _

_ “Our ﬁrst response was, ‘What a class.
young lady — her parents must be so proud.
There’s no need to get into a war with this
young girl, because tick—tock, her 15 minutes
are almost up.” :

Ultimately, this should be the attitude
that the entire viewing nation should take
when indulging in this beyond—guilty plea’.-
sure.

The “Shore” is a ﬂeeting fad, not unlike
many other MTV reality sensations. _Sure,
tourism rates will probably spike this sum-
mer at Seaside Heights, and ﬁst-pumping
will remain an ironic display of pop culture
awareness for a few more months, but a year
or two from now, no one will remember how
laughable these kids are.

Does anyone remember “Laguna Beach”?
Stephen Colletti, are you out there?

So my advice is to enjoy “Jersey Shore?
for what it is, and don’t think too hard about
how The Situation can make not being invit-
ed to chicken cutlet night a serious threat.

Take it with a grain of salt, or in this
case, a particularly large glob of Pauly D’s
hair gel.

Big East
hoops
 up

en"s teams in 2010

 
  

Randy Lieberman

Senior Staﬁ" Writer .

Big East play is upon us. No more C

gimme games, head-scratching
matchups or the occasional
blockbuster tipoff (Syracuse-
North Carolina).

No, it’s down to business for
Big East teams. These next couple
of months will arguably be Big
East teams’ most grueling of the
year. i
_ Here’s who’s up, who’s down
and what stories to follow in the
Big East conference this year:

The ’Gody

3 Notre Dame senior Luke Har-
angody will attempt to make his-
tory during the Irish’s Big East
slate this season.

Depending on his play this
year, the All-American forward
can become the Big East’s all-

A time scoring and rebounding

leader. '
J Before the Irish opened Big
East play with a 93-78 victory
over Providence last Wednesday,
Harangody had amassed 1,036
points across three seasons dur-
ing Big East play. That left him
just 369 points behind the re-
cord set by Syracuse’s Lawrence
Moten, who scored 1,405 points
from 1991-95.

Harangody also has 540 total
rebounds in three seasons, put-
ting him within striking distance
of another Syracuse record-
holder, Derrick Coleman, who
grabbed 701 rebounds.

Parity

Already through a few games
in the Big East, major conference
powers have fallen. Syracuse un-
characteristically took on a chal-
lenging nonconference schedule
this year, yet prevailed.

Rutgers, a redeeming chance

Will Pitt win two in a row against the once unbeatable Rutgers?

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
lost 13 straight games over 11
years to Rutgers before finally
defeating the Scarlet Knights 61-
53 in overtime last season.

The Panthers (11—4, 0-2 Big
East) look to build on last Feb-
ruary’s success when they take
on the Scarlet‘Knights (9-6, 1-0
Big East) at 1 p.m. in the Petersen
Event Center on Sunday.

This season’s teams have
something in common. Both
Pitt and Rutgers are missing star
players that guided their teams to
the Sweet 16 last season.

Rutgers lost All-Big East
Honorable Mention Kia Vaughn,
while Pitt is without third team
All-American Shavonte Zellous.

Following their senior sea-
sons, both Vaughn and Zellous
were selected in the ﬁrst round

of the WNBA draft. Vaughn went
eighth to the New York Liberty,
and Zellous was selected 11th by
the Detroit Shock.

Although Vaughn was drafted
higher, Zellous had the better
rookie season, averaging 11.9
points a game to Vaughn’s 4.8.
Zellous was also selected to the
WN BA All-Rookie team.

Now that Zellous and Vaughn
have graduated from the colle-
giate level, both Pitt and Rutgers

must adjust to playing without 4

their veteran leaders.
Vaughn led the Scarlet Knights
in rebounds (7.2 per game),

. blocked shots (1.9 per game)

and shooting percentage (59 per-
cent). Zellous led the Panthers
with 22.6 points per game.

But Rutgers isn’t just without
Vaughn this season. The team
also lost last season’s leading
scorer, junior Epiphanny Prince..

, Gibbs has 10 straight games of double-digit points
for Pitt. Most recently, he scored 24 points in a win

at Syracuse and 19 in a win at Cincinnati. '

” According to the Big East’s website,
as of last Wednesday, Big East teams had
combined for a 150-34 record, against non-
conference competition. .

If the winning percentage of .815 holds
throughout the season, it would be the
league’s best nonconference record since
1984-85’s mark of 102-20 (.836). Three
Big East teams, including Georgetown, St.
John’s and national champion Villanova,
reached the Final Four that year.

Rooting for an underdog?

I have two for you: Seton Hall and St.
John’s. '

Seton Hall roared out of the gate with A

its best start since the 1988-89 season
when it went to the national champion-
ship game. The Pirates lost just" one non-

already looks like a few young stars have
made headlines early in the season.

Syracuse’s Wes Johnson is a true star
and one of the best players in the nation.
He averages 17.1.points per game and 8.8
rebounds per game, showing his true
inside-outside game that’s difﬁcult for
opponents to stop.

Pitt sophomore Ashton Gibbs, rec-
ognized this week by ESPN.com’s Andy
Katz, is another budding star. Gibbs has
10 straight games. of double-digit points
for Pitt. Most recently, he scored 24 points.
in a win atsyracuse and 19 in alwin at
Cincinnati. ,

Georgetown’s Greg Monroe is becoming
a beastin the paint. For the year, Monroe is
almost averaging a double-double, scoring
14.8 points per game and averaging 9.8

rebounds per game. . V . L

Panthers to face Knights

Rutgers 4 11

gers with a 19.5 points per game scoring
average, announced she was leaving col-
lege to go play overseas in Turkey. Prince
is expected to enter and be selected in the
2010 WNBA Draft in April.

This season, Pitt point guardjania Sims
stepped into the role of leading scorer for
the Panthers, averaging 13.9 points per
game. Both Taneisha Harrison and Shayla
Scott also help ﬁll the void left by Zellous’
departure, averaging 12.5 and 11.6 points
per game, respectively.

66

The Panthers need
to ﬁnd the scoring
 offense that they

-  brought to the court

4 earlier in the season.

Sims accumulated 48 points in the Pan-
thers’ first two conference games against
Marquette and West Virginia, including a
career-high 28 points on 11-of-19 shooting
against West Virginia.

However, despite her scoring success, A

Pitt lost both games to open the Big East
season. The defeats could stem from a
lack of help for Sims on offense.

Only Brittaney Thomas joined her
in double figures against West Virginia.
Against Marquette, Sophronia Sallard
reached double ﬁgures with 11 points.

The Panthers needto find the scoring
offense that -they brought to the court ear-
lier in the season. Pitt averages 71.6 points
per game. Against Marquette and West
Virginia, they managed only 57 points
per game.

Finding offense against Rutgers won’t

be an easy task, as the Scarlet Knights are
tied for fourth in the Big East in scoring
‘defense, allowing opponents to score 55
points per game. I ‘
55 However, Rutgers is also 12th in the
conference in scoring, averaging 58.9
points per game.
For Rutgers, senior Brittany Ray as-
sumed Prince’s scoring role.
She ranks fourth in the Big East in scor-
ing, averaging 17.3 points per game. How-

ever, no other Scarlet Knights are among
the top 30 scorers in the conference.

The Scarlet Knights struggled so far
this season without Vaughn and Prince
but started out the Big East season with a
60-57 victory over DePaul.

.Ray scored 21 points in the victory,
while backcourt mate Erica Wheeler added
12 points. April Sykes contributed a dou-
ble—double off the bench with 15 points
and 11 rebounds.
