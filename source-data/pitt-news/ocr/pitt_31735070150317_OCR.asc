New bomb

Pittsburgh police responded to
a bomb threat found in a note
in Room 107 of David Lawrence
Hall Monday morning.

Pitt Police Chief Tim Del-
aney stood outside the building
at around 9 a.m. while a vehicle
marked “Canine Response Unit”
idled on Forbes Avenue. Delaney
said the ‘threat came in to the‘
county dispatcher at 8:06 a.m.,
and city police responded ﬁrst.

He said police ofﬁcers
searched the area with the dogs
and bomb wands —— devices that
detect certain chemicals found
in explosives — with negative
results. -

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
said three threatening notes
have been found this week: Two
were found today — one in
David Lawrence and the other
in Posvar Hall —- and one was
found on Sept. 19, also in David
Lawrence. All of the notes were
dated Sept. 17.

3 Hill said that law” enforce-
ment assessed the threats and
deemed them “non—credible,” so
Pitt didn’t issue an ENS alert, and
no evacuations took place.

These are the ﬁrst bomb
threats reported at Pitt since the
slew of niore than 140 threats
that disrupted campus last
spring. ‘

Those threats, which forced
the University to cancel classes,

It wasn’t just a poetry reading; -it
was_a discussion on racial iden-
tity. .
Natasha Trethewey, the cur-?—f.’
rent U.S. Poet laureate, spoke to
a full auditorium Monday night
in the Frick Fine Arts Building as
part of the Pittsburgh Contempo-
rary Writers Series. During her
45-minute reading, the poet read
several of her works exploring

various ideas scattered through-

out history.

After introducing herself to
the audience, Trethewey quickly
moved into her readings. But

‘ﬁrst, she made a brief statement

about her latest book, “Thrall.”
“‘Thrall’ is very much a book
about knowledge  but it’s a his-
tory of ideas,” Trethewey said. “I
try to make sense of our shared
history.” ‘
Throughout the night, she-
read poetry about mixed races

‘ and other historical ideas.

Trethewey was born in Gulf-
port, =Miss., in 1966 to a black

‘mother and a white father. Many

of the poems she read during the
night touched on the theme of ra-
cial identity. “Miracle of the Black
Leg” was one.

The poem is based on a “myth
of the miraculous transplant ...
involving a black donor and a
white recipient,” the poet said.
The concept comes from a tradi-
tional-tale that originated in the
12th century, and it’s been dis-
played through pictures in Spain,
Germany, Belgium, Portugal and _

Students discuss ﬁrsthand experience with Romani culture

Kenny Ong
Visual Editor

A new study abroad program aimed to
help students understand a_ much-ma-
ligned culture last summer, and on Mon-
day, its participants got together to share
what they learned.

Pitt’s music department held its ﬁrst
Symposium on Romani studies in the
William Pitt Union from 8:30 a.m. to 3
p.m. Monday. During the conference, 12
students, mostly from Pitt, presented
their ﬁnal projects from the maiden voy-
age of the Romani Music, Culture and
Human Rights study abroad program.

The program took students on a tour
through the Czech Republic, Poland and
Slovakia to learn about the current state
of Roma affairs in Eastern Europe. Stu-
dents attended Khamoro, a Roma music
festival in Poland, to learn about the cul-
ture and then visited Lunik IX, a Roma
ghetto in Slovakia, to witness Roma hu-
man rights violations.

Adriana Helbig, the mastermind be-
hind the trip, planned the symposium as
a bookend to the study abroad excursion.

“It’s important that we’re not only do-
ing a study abroad program, but also fol-
lowing up with all these presentations,”
Helbig said. _

Although the program was organized
by the music department, it was open to
students of all majors and interests. The
variety of attendees was evidenced by
the variety of ﬁnal project topics, rang-
ing from social networking to fabric art,
all contextualized by the students’ inter-
actions with Roma culture, people and
human rights issues-

“I think that’s the only way to really
study. Everyone always brings the frame-
work they already have, and then all the
classes expand. The reason that it’s mu-
sic-based is because music plays a cen-
tral role in how Roma are perceived —

States.
Dylan Crossen, a senior music and an-
thropology major, titled his presentation
“Perceptions of Roma and Their Music.”

Crossen took classes in Roma music with
Helbig, which gave him extensive, yet
secondhand knowledge of Romani'is—
sues. .

“People definitely need to be made
aware of Romani problems," especially
now, with reality television ‘creating
more misconceptions,” Crossen said,
referring to recent TV shows, including
TLC’s “My Big Fat American Gypsy Wed-
ding,” that depict a dramatized version
of Westernized Romani culture. H

Christine Lim, an undeclared sopho-

more, joined the program to pursue her
interest in music but had no prior knowl-
edge of the human rights issues.

“It wasn’t something I had ever
-thought about before. I didn’t know they
had so many struggles going on for them,
and I think it’s good that we’re spreading
awareness of that,“ Lim said.

Lim, who was considering pharma-
cology, titled her final project “Reducing
Tuberculosis Transmission in Europe by
Minimizing Romani Homelessness, Dis-
crimination and Other Stress Factors.” l

Kristen Fox, a 37-year-old Pittsburgh
native from Centre Township who re-
cently received her master’s degree in
Romani studies from Carlow University,
was also in attendance.

“Not very many schools have Romani
Studies, and they’re the biggest minor-
ity in Europe,” she said. “The unemploy-
ment, the health and the housing is al-
ready a crisis.” ‘ ’

Fox also runs Dontsaygypsy.com, a
website that promotes commentary and
discussion on international Romani is-

sues. She often attends other events con- j

cerning Romani human rights.

“I’ve been to other conferences, and
they’ve said, ‘Please, we need Ameri-
cans. We need Americans because you
can influence things, and you can bring
change,”’ she said.

COLUMN

Pittsburglfs collective   fashion sense
leaves room for improvement

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

Have you guys noticed it? Walk-
ing around Atwood and Forbes
these days seems harshly unfa-
miliar. I know that I can’t be the
only person noticing this: People
need to learn how to dress!

Now, Pittsburgh hasn’t always
been known as a house of fash-
ion. In fact, GQ recently rated
us as the third—worst-dressed
city in America, calling our style
of dress “meth-lab formal.” My
ﬁrst reaction to this was disgust
at the author’s opinion. Then I
wondered if meth was a bigger
problem in Pittsburgh than I
thought. But now I kind of have
to agree with GQ’s original con-
clusion.

We suck at dressing ourselves.
And the excuses for outﬁts that

’ people think are acceptable are

not working in the city’s favor
for the next round of city fashion
rankings. Can we get some fash-
ion design majors out here?
When I started at Pitt, I
thought that people were gener-
ally well-dressed. There seemed
to be four distinct groups com-

posing the student population

on campus, and each had its own
sense of style.

The ﬁrst group was the hip-
sters. When they put down the
gluten-free PBR and stopped
Instagraming long enough for
me to get a look at them, I must
say that I was impressed. They
were able to pull off the plaid

that hasn’t been cool since dad

times. The skinny jeans weren’t
exactly my taste, but who could
argue with the hair styles? It was
like they didn’t care, but they
did, but they didn’t, and it was
perfect.

Next were the preps. When
they put down their designer
accessories and golf clubs long
enough for me to get a look at
them, I must say that I was im-
pressed. They were rocking pas-
tels like they were living a Greek
fresco. The boat shoes weren’t
really for me, but their dress set
an attitude. It wasn’tthat I want-
ed to be a prep, but I didn’t hate
their style, either.

Next were the jocks. When
they put down their free weights
and protein shakes long enough
for me to get a look at them, I
must say that I was impressed.

They had a way of making the

letters P—I-T-T blend into an en-
tire fashion statement. I wasn’t
always down with the compres-
sion shorts, but the jocks always
seemed ready to defend my
school’s honor. It was like the
Pitt community was always safe
from rogue Penn State fans.

Finally, there were the nerds.
When they put down their pocket
protectors and wide-brimmed
glasses long enough for me to
get a look at them, I must say
that I was impressed. They were
always making old Carnegie Mel-
lon sweatshirts appear cool. I
may not have been up for sport-
ing a calculator, but I loved the
comb—overs. It was like Yale had
nothing on us, and I loved it.

But I look around now, and I
don’t know what has happened.
Sure, there are still Pitt shirts all
over campus, but they look worn-
down and a little overmatched
by the Youngstown State shirts.
The hipster has evaporated and

the preps seem to have lost all of _

their polos in the recession. Even
the nerds stay on the CMU side
of Craig Street these days.

This has to stop. We have an

obligation to our reputations to do better.
Do we want people across the country to
think we go to West Virginia University or
something?

- We need to have a statement, and I
know what that might be: sports colors.
Although many will point to the love of

black and gold in this city as detrimental -

to our dress, I think we can make it work.
Nobody has more pride for local sports
teams than Pittsburghers, and I don’t
know of any other city that can represent
everything their city is about in two col-
ors. ‘ i

It’s time to step up beyond the Steel— V V

ers jersey and the Terrible Towel. We need
to move into wider varieties of black and
gold. I’m talking about wallets, shoes,
dresses, suits and everything else we own.
It’s time for us to become a Wiz Khalifa
song. '

So if you have been walking around
campus wondering when people threw
out clothing sense and brought in sweat-
pants and tights, I hope that you will join
me. ‘There is hope in returning our uni-
versity to fashion sense. We need to bring
back the hipsters, the preps, the’ jocks and
the nerds. We need the plaid, the pastels,
the compression shorts and the calcula-
tors. We can do it, and we can do it all in
black and yellow. I

LET ToR

To the Editor,

I live on Bates Street, right at the in-
tersection of Bates and the Boulevard of
the Allies — and right now the bikers are
taking over the sidewalks: They ride like
they’re Nascar drivers, trying to run peo-
ple over — they don’t say “biker coming,”
and they whiz right by. On my street there
are two disabled people: one uses a cane
and the other a walker. They are in danger
when these idiots come out of nowhere,
and if you say a word to them, you get a
ﬁnger or a foul word. I also found out that
they are not allowed to ride on the side-
walks. There should be a law about this

—- if a car has to have a license plate, why
don’t bikers get one? That way if there is an
accident, you have the plate number. When
you call 911, the biker‘ can be anywhere
by the time the police show up. I saw the
article in last month’s Pitt News (Aug. 30)
about the riders in Oakland. This is a very
serious matter —- they don’t care. There
is a small park behind the homes on Bates
Street, and they can ride right through
there — they won’t get lost. Something
has to be done about it, and soon, before a
bad accident happens.

scene for local models, designers and stylists.

“I wanted to see more work in the modeling in~
dustry, and because I didn’t feel there were enough
resources here for that, I ventured out into other
markets to do so,” Anderson said. “Every time
I came back home to Pittsburgh, there were less
and less jobs, and I still had to create work for my-
self. That thought alone was enough to make me
want to do something about it.”

Angel Yimin, a part—time fashion assistant to
the fashion and marketing coordinator for the
Mall at Robinson, has worked with Pittsburgh
Fashion Week since its conception in 2010.

“I believe that fashion is a tool to help you show
who you really are as a person. Style is individual
~ whatever you wear should make you feel conﬁ-
dent,” she said.

The past two falls have proven that Pittsburgh
Fashion Week is getting stronger. The inaugural
foray into the city’s sartorial scene brought out
around 2,000 guests, and last year’s events had
even more. The week is funded with the help of
local sponsors who feel their businesses partner
well with fashion.

Local venues such as the Heinz History Center,
the Mall at Robinson, the Omni William Penn Ho-

tel and locations in Washington County ‘will fea-
ture some of the week’s happenings. With back-

to-back runway shows in the style of New York’s

most exclusive catwalks, professional styliststo

help prep local models and an abundant supply '

of the coming year’s most fashionable garb, the
event puts the city -—— and its most stylish people
—— on display. .

While it all sounds very glitzy, glamorousand
oh—so-“Gossip Girl,” the founders have to put in a
good deal of work behind the scenes to keep the
week running smoothly. Professionals in them-
dustry and local volunteers are put in charge of
prep work for the shows, including marketing,
ﬁnding talent to host, contacting models and ask:
ing stores and designers to participate.

Since the mall got involved with the week—long
event during its ﬁrst year, Yimin has continued to
help plan the event and work with merchandise
from participating stores in the mall.

“I go in on my days off from my full~time job, as
well as going in after work at night, sometimes un-
til midnight,” Yimin said. “We pull merchandise‘
for the models, conduct ﬁttings, exchange sizes
and items to make the look work and untag and
tape the bottoms of shoes. So many hours go into
a short period of show time, but it’s all worth it.”

from similar stores, as well as from La-

Though the jewelry has suffered some

“I kind of like the threadbare hues
they’ve taken on,” he said.

He purchased the rest of his out-

brown, lace—up shoes come from Avalon

Pitt suffers ﬁrst defeat of season in Big East. opener againstCincinnati

Panthers dropped a 1-0 contest to Cincinnati. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

Andrew Stern
Staff Wrz'ter

After playing four games in eight days,
fatigue seemed to plague the Pitt men’s
soccer team as the Panthers suffered their
ﬁrst defeat of the season Saturday night.

Facing the Cincinnati Bearcats (4-4-
1, _1-0 Big East) in the conference opener
for both teams, Pitt (6-1-2, 0-1 Big East)
dropped a tight 1-0 decision on a rainy
and windy evening at the Petersen Sports
Complex.

“I thought a fewof our guys didn’t have
the performance we were looking for,” Pitt
head coachjoe Luxbacher said. “The effort
was there, but we just weren’t as sharp as
Cincinnati.” '

Pitt started the game quickly, setting
the tempo and creating several scoring
chances.

The Panthers’ best scoring chance of
the ﬁrst half occurred when freshman
Graham Smith sent a perfect pass to the
feet of junior Ryan McKenzie, who ripped
a shot that was blocked by a Cincinnati de-
fender.

After the great scoring chance, Pitt
failed to keep the momentum, and the
Bearcats opened the scoring just before
the break.

Cincinnati midﬁelder Matt Remaley hit
a shot that Pitt goalie Lee Johnston was

able to save.

Unfortunately for the Panthers, the re-
bound deﬂected right to Bearcat freshman
John Manga, who ﬁnished the opportuni-
ty, giving. his team what would prove to be
a decisive 1-0 lead.

“The goal came down to maturity,” Pitt
senior captain John Cordier said after the
game. “This is a young team, but at the
same time, we need to know when to kill
a half. But tonight we were unable to do
that, and it cost us.” ‘ w

Unlike previous games, Pitt didn’t pro-
duce a dramatic comeback.

The Panthers only had a few scoring
chances in the second half, with the best
of these coming off a free kick from sopho-
more Michael Tuohy.

In the 89th minute, Tuohy chipped the
ball into the box, where freshman Nick
Wysong headed the ball toward the net.
But Cincinnati goalie Taylor Haﬂing de-
ﬂected‘ the ball away, preserving the 1-0
advantage for his team.

Following the defeat, Johnston was al-
ready looking forward to Pitt’s next game.

“Navy is going to be a good challenge,
but the guys will be ready come Tuesday
night,” the sophomore goalie said.

Hoping to begin another undefeated
streak, the Panthers will host the Naval
Academy’s soccer team on Tuesday at the
Petersen Sports Complex at 7 I

A GRAIN or SAUL

Talented rookie passer Griffin, Ill Iightingup NFL defenses

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Robert Griffin III is the real deal._

I know we’re only three games into
the season. I know he’s played the Saints,
Rams and Bengals — three teams with a
combined 3-6 record. And yes, the Red-
skins are 1-2 overall and look like a me-
diocre team once again this season.

But here are some stats that tell a more
accurate story:

The Redskins have scored 99 points
so far this season, the most in the entire

.NFL. Unfortunately, only the Bengals’

and Saints’ defenses have allowed more
points against, hence the Redskins’ 1-2
record.

Don’t blame RG3, the Redskins’ tal-
ented rookie quarterback, for the team’s
failures.

Grifﬁn is sixth in the league in quar-
terback rating at 104.9. He’s averaging
almost nine yards per completion and he
has thrown four touchdowns. I=Ie’s been
virtually mistake-free, throwing only one

interception so far this year.

In comparison to the great Andrew
Luck, the only player drafted above RG3
in last April’s draft, Grifﬁn looks domi-
nant. '

He’s thrown three fewer interceptions,
his completion percentage is nearly 15
percent higher, he averages almost three
yards more per completion and his quar-
terback rating is almost 30 points higher.

And RG3 can run. '

He’s ranked the No. 15 rusher in the
NFL right now with 209 yards on the sea-
son, and he’s scored three touchdowns
using his legs. -

Want to compare him to another mo- '

bile quarterback, Michael Vick? It’s not
even close.

Grifﬁn has 115 more rushing yards and
two more touchdowns than the Philadel-
phia Eagles’ passer.

But these were things we knew. We
knew RG3 was fast. We knew he was dan-
gerous. We knew he had an accurate arm,
freakish size and athleticism.

But what we didn’t know about were

his intangibles.

Take a look back at this Sunday, when
the Redskins got torched in the ﬁrst half
against the Bengals and fell behind 24-7.
Instead of folding because of the adver-
sity, RG3 took control.

On the ﬁrst drive of the second half,
Grifﬁn had to complete only two passes
to march the Redskins 80 yards down the
ﬁeld for a touchdown.

— On their next possession, the Redskins
unleashed the triple option — a forma-
tion rarely seen in the NFL. Essentially,
Griffin would roll out of the pocket with
running back Alfred Morris and wide re-
ceiver Brandon Banks and make a simple
choice: take it himself, pitch to Morris or
pitch to Banks. .

The drive started when Griffin sent a
perfect ballunder pressure to receiver
Leonard Hankerson for a 23-yard gain.
Then, the Redskins rolled Griﬁin out
twice in a row to let him make the deci-
sion. On both occasions, the Bengals

Future college football kickers should be trained from young age  

Brian Batko
Suﬁ Wrz'ter

Only four weeks into the 2012 college foot-
ball season, an obvious pattern is emerg-
ing: Most college kickers just aren’t very
good. '

Examples of this trend abound across
the nation: '

Utah State nearly pulled off an upset '

of Wisconsin in week three, but its kicker
missed a 37-yard ﬁeld goal — considered
a “chip shot” by most — that would have

won the game in the ﬁnal seconds.

Sophomore Penn State kicker Sam
Ficken essentially cost his team the game
in a Week 2 loss to Virginia when he missed
four ﬁeld goals  one as time expired with
the Nittany Lions trailing by just one point

allege kickers such as Penn State’s Sam

Ficken have struggled this season. MCT
Campus V -

— and had an extra pointjblocked. T

j And even the Pitt football-team’s kicker,

Kevin Harper, is just 4-for-7 on ﬁeld—goal

tries this season, with only one of those

‘misses coming from 40 yards or more.
Now don’t?;get me wrong.’ I’m notsay-

ingekicking .}a‘ football through two up-

right’ posts is an easy thing to.do.;I know I

- couldn’t do it. i

 -But it is a "skill that onet¢anidie<}ot'evhis

, life to and should be able to master. fairly
well. There’s no doubt that making ﬁeld

goals of 30, 40 or so yards or more’ takes

-some talent. Any kicker needs some sem-

blance of natural leg strength to start with.
Inzthe instance of a guy like.Harper,

though, who is more than capable in that

category — he holds the high school state
record in Ohio for longest ﬁeld goal with a
61-yard kick andeven made his own kick-
ing trick-shot -video featuring ﬁeld goals
from ridiculous lengths — the job is more

mental- and accuracy-dependent than
anything.

Which, to me at least, presents the

question: Why the heck don’t more parents
start training their children. to be sure-
thing ﬁeld goal kickers from a young age?
“ We constantly hear about quarterbacks
and even athletes outside of football such
as golfers and gymnasts who were con-
sidered prodigies at young ages and spent
their entire adolescent lives practicing
their trade. ‘

with Valid PiTT
Undergrad T
(Oakland) ID.

It couldn’t be that difficult to do some-
thing similar with a young kicker.

First off, you’ll have to convince your
growing Adam Vinatieri that actually play-
ing football -— you know, like running,
throwing, catching and tackling -— is
vastly overrated. In this day and age, with
all attention paid to the -concussions and
serious injuries, it should be pretty easy
to convince a kid that hanging out on the
sidelines for most of the game yet still be-
ing considered a signiﬁcant part» of the

team isn’t a bad option.
Things might get slightly trickier with
the next phase of the process, however.

‘ Most youths ——- whether they’re inter-
ested in football or not — probably won’t
be thrilled with the idea of repeating the
exact same exercise ad nauseam, which is"
essentially what kicking practice is. You
set the ball on the tee, you back up seven
yards and then you run up and try to kick

Just six plays later, the Redskins scored

This sequence led to Grifﬁn chucking
a last—second incompletion from his own
41-yard line on a third-and-50. The Red-
skins lost 38-31, but Grifﬁn proved to his
team and his fans that he had arrived.

After the game, when asked how he
managed to get up over and over again
despite the huge hits he took all game,
Grifﬁn’s response summed him up as a
player: 7

“A lot of teams believe if you hit the
quarterback enough, he’s going to stop
coming after you,” Griﬂin said. “I just

the ball through the uprights. . i

As we’ve already established, this skill is
incredibly important in football, but call-
ing it tedious would not be a stretch.

Lastly, once you’ve managed to get past
those two hurdles, you’d have to deal with
the most pertinent aspect of ﬁeld-goal
kicking: mental toughness. _

How can you simulate being counted
on by 50 to 80 other grown men and thou-
sands of fans to do the same exact thing
that you’ve "done thousands of times in
practice but now at a critical moment and
with inﬁnitely more pressure?

Well, the short answer is, you can’t. But
you can get creative. ,

Maybe tell your 10-year-old kicking
protege that dessert will be withheld if the
next ﬁeld goal try is wide right. Or, if you’re
more of a positive-reinforcement type, al-

 

' lowance will increase by 200 percent if

your little David Akers Jr. can nail this one
from 35 yards out. ‘

This idea and these steps might sound
drastic or perhaps even absurd. But hey, we
have an epidemic on our hands here.

Staring at a 2-point deﬁcit, with the ball
on the opponent’s 35-yard line and three
seconds left in the game, wouldn’t you feel
much better if your team’s kicker has been
preparing for this moment his entire life?

I know I would. ﬂ
