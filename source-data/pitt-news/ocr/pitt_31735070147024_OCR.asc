CWO takes back the night

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

Last night’s tornado watch didn’t halt
Pitt students from marching through
the streets with posters saying “My Body
Isn’t Yours,” “These Hands Don’t Hurt,”
and “Rape is not a Pitt Tradition.”
More than 45 people braved therainy
weather to attend Campus Women’s
Organization’s' “Take Back the Night”
event, which began at 7 p.m. on the Wil-
liam Pitt Union lawn and ended with a

A series of workshops about sexual assault

and its consequences.

The marchers first gathered under the
Union porch where organizers handed
out plastic.whistles, glowsticks, post-
ers and facepaint to support the cause.
Members from various student organi-
zations including Black Action Society,
Rainbow Alliance and Amnesty Inter-
national attended the event. A

Keely McCaskie, community outreach
chair for CWO, spoke through a micro-
phone explaining the importance of Take
Back the Night. 7

‘_‘Why are we raising our voices to-
night?” McCaskie asked the crowd.

“Maybe it’s because of the fear of walk-
ing alone, maybe it’s that our sister says
shegot hit by her boyfriend, maybe it’s
because society tells us it’s our fault.
Why are we here? Because tonight we
will not be afraid!” .

The crowd rallied around McCaskie
and CWO president Robin Lane. The
group repeated chants like “Real Men

Theirgoal is to find a means of com-
puting that can ﬁnd and sort information
exponentially faster and more securely
than classical computers. To do this,
they are developing a way to storehand
transmit information in the form "of
“qubits,” or electrons with a particular
spin, rather than in standard bits.

Standard computers use bits, or codes
of zeros and ones, to store information.
Using qubits presents an advantage be-
cause they can store information in ze-
ros, ones and any “superposition” of
zero and. one, greatly increasing the
amount of memory and computing power
available.

Using vast quantities of qubits, a
quantum computers can have the power
to simultaneously explore entire data-
bases, reducing the time it takes to locate

specific information. The technology,
still in it infant state, also has security
and encryption implications.

It‘ was about 30 years ago that the
military first began contracting quan-
tum-computing research, Dutt said, as a
means to code and crack information.

“One of the big things with quantum
computers,” Beran said, “is that some
people can use algorithms for factor-
ing really big numbers into all of their
primes [thus allowing them to decode
information]. Primes and algorithms
form the basis for a lot of cryptography,
which is how sensitive information is
encrypted over the Internet.”

The idea is that if qubits are used to
store information, others will not be able
to break them down into simple ones and
zeros and intercept information.

Foreclosures increase

Andrew Bergman

For The Pitt News 7

A local real estate agent said the recent spike
in foreclosed housing might beneﬁt students

’  looking to settle down in Pittsburgh, though ‘

some people disagree.
' The increased rates of foreclosures in
Pittsburgh were outlined as part of a study

A released by Pitt professors Chris Briem and Sa-

bina Deitrick last month. The study concluded
that foreclosure rates in certain Pittsburgh
neighborhoods are higher than the statewide

average.
The study found that communities like

Chris Briem:

areas have a smaller real estate market and
therefore don’t see these numbers of foreclo-
sures, he said.

Carol Marks, a real estate brokerwith Cold-
well Banker, said foreclosures might actually be
good for recent graduates, as foreclosed homes
and surrounding properties of reduced value
are more affordable for ﬁrst-home buyers.

Briem, a professor with Pitt’s University
Center for Social and Urban Research depart-
ment, disagreed because the areas affected
aren’t traditionally populated with students.

“I’m not sure if there is a direct impact on
current students, who are mostly renters, be-
cause most of these areas with high foreclosure

Most of these areas with high

foreclosure rates are far from

Beechview, Sheraden and Brookline, among
others, have unusually high numbers of resi-
dential real estate-owned properties, which are
properties owned by banks or ﬁnancial institu-
tions, typically as a result of foreclosure.

Sheraden, one of the areas that the study
examined, has a foreclosure rate of 22.2 per
1000 housing units, several times the Penn-
sylvania average.

Despite some of Pittsburgh’s higher rates,
Pennsylvania’s overall foreclosure rate of 1 per
950 housing units is still only about one—third of
the national average, according to RealtyTrac,
a ﬁrm that compiles-foreclosure data.

Other neighborhoods in the greater Pitts-
burgh area, such as Carrick, South Perry, Mount
Washington, Brighton Heights, ‘Garﬁeld, Ha-
zelwood and Homewood North, also exhibit
markedly higher foreclosure rates, according
to the study. ’ .

“These aren’t areas where you would expect
to see foreclosures,” Briem said. Less affluent

neighborhoods where students live.

rates are far from neighborhoods where stu-

dents live,” Briem said. ‘ t ‘
Briem also said that foreclosures cause

negative consequences for neighborhoods,

because they pull down property values, even 2

in nonforeclosed homes.

“There is atrend with lower-priced homes -

being the ﬁrst to [be foreclosed], because of
predatory lenders and lower-income people
being unable to pay their mortgages,” Marks
said.

The study reported that since ﬁnancial in-
stitutions have these foreclosed homes oflower
values on their portfolios, that even after the
market stabilizes, there will still be long-term
impacts.

Despite the mixed implications, the study
did conﬁrm that overall, Pittsburgh’s housing
market has weathered the national foreclo-
sure crisis well compared to other parts of the

country, like Riverside County, Calif., where the '

foreclosure rate is one in 103 housing  3

computing while working in the Old Engineering Hall.

“If we can develop a quantum net-
work, then information can be sent in
absolutely secure networks and no one
can eavesdrop,” Dutt said.

The reason for this is that qubits don’t

necessarily represent either zero or one, .

but can represent both zero and one. The
numbers zero and one correspond to the
spin of the electron — if it’s zero, it spins
up, and if it’s one, it spins down.

“But the real reason as to why qubits
are appealing is that they can represent
both zeros and ones,” Beran said. “It
turns out that something that spins up
and down at the same time is plausible.
That’s how superposition plays into our

- computers.”

Beran explained how an electron is

' put into superposition and how the pro-

cess allows computers to work faster.
“We use sample diamonds that have
a defect. A diamond is carbon and the
defect is nitrogen, which is a vacancy in
the diamond where a bunch of electrons

exist,” Beran said. “The first thing we —

do is make the electronic ‘state of the
electron zero.”

The researchers shine a green laser’

on a diamond for “a fraction of a frac-
tion of a second,” Beran said, and that
makes the electrons spin up. ’,
To make the electron spin down, a
current is sent through a copperwlire

on top of the diamond. The oscillating
magnetic field interacts with the zero
state and the electron “becomes one,”
spinning down. ‘

“We work with extremely small times,
but if we figure out the amount of time it
takes to put the electron to one, and half
this time we can get it to a superposition
state, somewhere in between zero and
one,” Beran said.

With this part of the research com-
plete, the team now focuses on creat-
ing quantum networks. Dutt explained
that the team is currently working on
building a protocol that allows people to
exchange information through quantum
networks. .

“We will use an electron to encode
information onto a photon, which is a
package of light that can transmit in-
formation over a fiber link to another
computer,” Dutt said.

— A1l_of the applications of this upcom-
ing technology are theoretical, Dutt ex-
plained. There are other researchers
involved in the software side of quantum
computers to develop uses.

“We are at the level that the [first
‘computer scientists] were at 62 years
ago when computers filled up rooms,”
Dutt said. “Now -that technology can all
be found in the palm of your hand in a
calculator or cellphone.” I

Students gather for march, workshops, pizza

Dozens of male and female students discuss domestic violence prevention and the dangers of sexual assault

March 4 1

means yes,” and “Panthers Unite, Take
Back the Night.” ’

Carrying umbrellas and posters, the
group embarked on the 15-minute march
through the William Pitt Union, Schenley
Quad, Towers lobby, Towers patio and
Fifth Avenue and stopped back in front
of the Union.

The march was originally set to travel
through South Oakland, but organizers
shortened the march because of incli-
mate weather. .

During the march, many bystand-
ers stopped in their tracks to watch the
procession, and some residents from
Towers and Holland cheered them on.

Tosin Ogunkoya and Chi-Chi ‘Nwatu,
both juniors at:P—i‘tt,< watched fro minside
the Union. .

“It shows empowerment to females;
they are saying something and they
mean it,” Nwatu said.

Ogunkoya agreed.

“They have a very important message
to share, especially in a college environ-
ment,” Ogunkoya said.

Michael Brady, ajunior, watched the
march as it passed through the Forbes
side of Towers patio.

“Honestly, I was a little caught off
guard,” Brady said. “It’s interesting and
good that they are doing this; it catches
people when they don’t expect it, a good
wake—up call for the student body.”

After the march, the group moved to
the sixth floor of the William Pitt Union
for pizza and workshops discussing the
stigma of domestic violence and sexual

abuse, as well as the equal presence of '

abuse in the LGBT community.

Other advocacy groups, including
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape and Cri-
sis Center North attended Take Back The
Night. Both supplied contacts and infor-
mation for people looking for guidance
when dealing with domestic violence
and sexual abuse.

Laura Summers, education and train-
ing specialist for Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape, walked in the march and
talked to attendees during the work-
shops and discussions.

“In their freshman year between ori-
entation and Thanksgiving, women are
most likely to experience some sort of
sexual violence,” Summers said. “We
help with prevention through different
programs.”

Adam Dobson, community outreach
coordinator for Rainbow Alliance, pre-
sented a workshop focusing on LGBT
sexual violence and abuse.

“We don’t think of men abusing men,”
Dobson said, “only men abusing women,
but it is a real problem in the LGBT com-
munity.”

Lane and McCaskie presented the sec-
ond workshop, stressing that any form
of domestic violence and sexual abuse
is not the victim’s fault.

Following the workshop, CWO mem-
bers asked the audience to call local Rep.
Michael Doyle, Sen. Arlen Specter and

Sen. Robert Casey to push for the Family '

Violence Prevention and Services Act.
They also called on audience mem-

bers to push their government to ratify
the United Nations’ Convention on the
Elimination of all forms of Discrimina-
tion Against Women, an international
bill that provides abuse protection rights
for women. Within two minutes, at least
13 people were on their cell phones, leav-
ing messages for the elected officials.
Take Back the Night concluded with a
final cheer, in which the audiencejoined

in unison chanting, “We have the power,
we have the right, the streets are ours,
take back the night.”

Lane said she was extremely happy
about the turnout.

“Last year we had about 15 people,
this year we had many more: different
organizations, people who were not un-
dergraduates and men in the audience,”
she said.I

EDITORIAL

Rally for ‘sanity’ a
timely opportunity

You remember that kid — yes, you do. That
oh—so-eager kid in middle or high school
who’d make sure to always sit in the front
row, and whenever the teacher would ask
half a question he’d shoot up his hand and --
stopping of course to gather his variegated
opinions — he’d recite so much wrong or
misguided information that you wondered
how lowly the teacher actually thought of
your class. Remember how frustrating it was
to get any learning accomplished with that
loud, erring voice drowning out the critical
thinking process itself?

Unfortunately for people like you, that
kid grew up — and now he can vote, write
letters and checks, hold rallies, run for office
and anchor highly rated programs on 24-hour
news networks. That kid, who represents the
unrelenting, unreasonable but nonetheless
powerful fringes of our current political spec-
trum, has slowly wrapped his sweaty ﬁngers
around the jugular of the American agenda,
gaining an inﬂuence so profound that he can
no longer be ignored.

So we’re happy Jon Stewart, the host of
Comedy .Central’s satirical news program
“The Daily Show,” is paying attention to this
prototypical kid, or at least his faults, by hold-
ing a rally on the National Mall on Oct. 30.

The event is called the “Rally to Restore
Sanity,” and it is set to take place from noon
to 3 p.m. on Saturday alongside a sister rally,
the “March to Keep Fear Alive,” organized by
former “Daily Show” correspondent and now
satirical talk show host Stephen Colbert.

In an interview with CNN’s Larry King
last week, Stewart said the rally is aimed “for
the people that are too busy, that have jobs
and lives and are tired of their reﬂection in
the media as being a divided country and
a country that’s ideological and conﬂicted

and ﬁghting.” _

As we’ve learned from the millions of
people who attended Barack Obama’s inau-
guration, a momentous gathering of earnest
citizens doesn’t come close to healing a bit-
terly divided nation. But even so we can’t say
that Stewart, who in a 2009 Time Magazine
survey beat out Brian Williams to become
America’s most trusted newscaster, is wast-
ing his time.

Regardless of what exactly Stewart has
in store for those early Saturday afternoon
hours, the mere idea fueling the rally — and
the fact that tens of thousands are expected
to attend — offers the American people a
kind of opportimity that doesn’t come along
enough: the opportunity to ﬁnally reﬂect
upon the quality of our discourse.

Too often our collective attention, which
could be put to so much good use on solving
issues like a crumbling education system or
unsustainable Medicare promises, is leeched
away by highly charged but no less irrelevant
controversies.

Just because some witless statement or
“mosque” proposal garner bicameral out-
rage doesn’t endow such arguments with any
more signiﬁcance for a struggling American
people — itjust makes them proﬁtable as TV
soundbites. Modern news coverage — and
reﬂexively people too —- think too much in
terms of controversy, of who’s saying the most

outrageous comment and who else wants to »

comment on that comment, instead of actu-
ally approaching hard issues that only get
worse the more we stray from them.

We just hope Stewart’s rally will give those
people whose reasoned, moderate voices have
been so long drowned out a chance to realize
they’re not alone. Because that kid shouldn’t
always have to command the debate. I

of them sucked blood. Garlic, crosses and holy
water worked against most of them — except
maybe Vikings — and they all seemed to prey
onteenagers who were making outinthe family

beasts. Now, with the advent of the Internet,
there’s a lot more popularity to go around. Vam-
pires and wizards are as well—known as crime

. scene investigators and Ke$ha, and there are

plenty of good scares to be had. Infact, the media
is so saturated with good scares that the only
place you’ll be able to make your devil’s mark in
the world of horror is through fanﬁction.
Fanﬁction, whichﬁrst appeared on a web-
site-hosting service called Geocities, is a kind of
writing in which an unpaid, untalented person
takes some well-known author’s characters and
puts them in new and grammatically incoherent
sinxaﬁons. ‘ j - A
The reasons for doing this are unclear but
often seem to involve wish ﬁilﬁlment and adult
situaﬁons. For example, inwhat we believe might

_p haveactuallyhappenedinthebest-sellingstories,
‘ the boy-vvizard HarryPotterneedsto die avirgin

in orderto redeem mankind. In your Harry Pot-
ter fanﬁction, however, he can have as much as
sex as he wants, often with several ghouls and
goblins at the same time.

Asyoucansee, fanﬁction is aﬂexible medium.
You don’t need to come up with new ogres and
demons to starin it, and you can make the exist-
ing ones do whateveryou need them to do. Once
you settle on your character; you can fashion a
white-knuckle adventure story for him or her.

_ Here, we’ll do one with you. Our main char-
acters are the Teen Wolf, formerWWE champion
“Hulk” Hogan and Count Chocula. These three,
who have been best friends since college, set out
to solve a mystery.

V It seems that some old farmers well keeps
leaking, and spectral activity is suspected. The
“Hulkster” isterriﬁed of ghosts, so of course he’s
not going to want to help.

he cashed in on the dot~com bubble. His zombie
henchman Bachelor Brad, who is always unlucky
in love, has agreed to help him in exchange for
a zombie bride. ,

To make along story short, there’s abigﬁght.
Things start off well for the bad guys, but once
everyone’s favorite peroxide-blonde behemoth
“Hulks out,” it’s curtains for them. Bachelor Brad
has agood sex scene with the farmer’s daughter,

You mustn’t lose sight of your debt to
F the generations of horror fanfiction
writers who came before you.

However, Count Chocula and the Teen Wolf

are both very experienced with ghosts, since

vampires and werewolves are both distant cous-
ins of the ghost species. After some witty banter
that will lead “I-Iullé’ to “Hulk out” and rip off
his shirt, thetriowillclimbdownintothewell
to investigate. '

Inside the well, the ghost ofDonald Trump is
upto some tricks. He knows there’s money to be
had there, namely oil, and he intends to cash in
on the energy crisis in much the same way that

and then Count Choculaturnsback into ahuman
and steals her away ﬁom him.

Granted, this is just a short sample story,
but it’s a really scary one and very much in the
spirit of All Hallows Eve. After you write a story
like this, you need to upload it to your Geocities
page.,Make sure you set the background color
to black and the text"color to orange or green.
Maybe even add a haunting MIDI ﬁle to spice
up your story with music and ﬁirther establish
the eerie mood.

Once you’ve posted your story, link to it on a
fanﬁcﬁon forum or a newsgroup like alt.fanﬁc-
tion.super—scary. As soon as your link goes up,
a bunch of captious middle-aged men will alert
you to its inaccuracies.

For instance, you might have had “Hulk”
Hogan pressing 300 pounds overhead when
everyone knows he has never pressed morethan

275. Or maybe you committed the cardinal sin"

and confused an android with a cyborg. No
matter how trivial your mistakes were, they’re
sure to be uncovered by this bunch of tireless
truth-seekers.

Remember that no matter how ﬁm those hot
college Halloween parties are, you mustn’t lose
sight of your debt to the generations of horror
fanﬁctionwriters who came before you. Although
this season mightbethelastonewhereyou look
ﬂy in a revealing costume, it’s never too late for
agreat scare. «

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Respect the value of slower judicial proceedings

Mark Kozlowski
A Columnist

 

A Reality television has been going on for too

long. But, unlike most fads, I think I know

where the trend first sprung to life: courtroom I

shows. I’ll admit, hearing Judge Judy tell a
swindler and a crook that he’s a swindler and a
crook on national TV has a certain appeal. But

V after endless streams of shows like “judgejoe

Mathis,” do we really need another concept

‘show like CBS’s recently syndicated show,

“Swift]ustice with Nancy Grace”?

Now, the title itself is —— pardon the pun —
arresting. We often bemoan the slowness of
the courts, the “sluggish public trial” never in-
tended in the Bill of Rights, and so a speedier,
swifter form of justice sounds attractive to
many. Whereas it is important that trials not
go on for ages and that the guilty aren’t able
to escape the law through constant delay and
technicalities, ‘we should realize that swift
justice is not always sure.

We must not allow our desire for speed
to overwhelm the need to ﬁnd the innocent
not guilty.Consider one example of when a
desire to convict quickly led to the convic-
tion of the wrong man: the Dreyfus Affair of
1894-1900.

As you might have learned in school, this
“affair”. started when the French were able
to steal adocument from a German military
attache in Paris. The document was a list of
French military secrets that had recently been
sold to the Germans by a traitor in the French

' Army. The information was highly sensitive:

data about the latest French artillery pieces,

~ mobilization plans in the case of war against

Germany as_well as other information.
Suspicion fell upon Captain Alfred Dreyfus,

a young officer who had trained in artillery.

He became the prime suspect because he was

rich, arrogant, Jewish and disliked by those '

conducting the investigation. The handwrit-
ing on the document was compared to that of
Dreyfus, with one handwriting expert saying
it was his hand, and another expert saying
he disagreed. The latter expert was roundly
ignored. With this _“evidence,” whichwas kept
in a secret ﬁle along withabject forgeries of
documents incriminating him, Dreyfus was
convicted in a sham of afour-day—long court-
martial. ’

Of course, had the French paused, they
would have considered the facts that exon-

erated Dreyﬁis. For one thing, there ,were

grammatical and technical indications that
the document came from someone who was
clearly unfamiliar with artillery. However,
the French Armywas in a hurry to ﬁnd some-

body guilty and close the case. This meant
thorough investigation was impossible and
allowedforged documents to be readily ac-
cepted. Upon convicting Dreyfus, the French
military didn’t want to reverse itself for fear of
losing face. Indeed, even after the real traitor
was caught, even after it was clear Dreyfus
was innocent, he was court-martialed and
convicted again. .

What we can learn from this is that while
appeals processes take lots of time and are
really armoying, they are vital means by which
the falsely accused can protect themselves.
While justice is made slower this way, it is
surer. A too swift justice process also opens
the door to “justice” not executed based on
the facts but on who is in a better position to
present facts on short notice. Worse, if some
facts are made up entirely, this might not be
discovered until too late.

A major complaint about the jury system
is that juries are notoriously slow. However,
the snap trial that doesn’t involve a jury has
its downsides too. Consider a case that was
ﬁindamental in establishing the jury system
we have today.

Before he was turned into one of the tallest
points in Philadelphia, wealthy entrepreneur

and intrepid Quaker William Penn was a rather ‘

obnoxious religious dissident. Remember
that 17th-century England didn’t really be-

lieve in religious tolerance. Penn and William
Mead decided to test the laws against public
gatherings by preaching publicly. They were
arrested and charged with disruption of the
peace. The Lord Mayor of London served as
judge and was convinced the two were guilty.
So convinced, in fact, that he pretty much
ordered the jury to convict.

The jury reﬁised to do so. The judge ordered
the jury back into deliberations in what was in
essence a dungeon and grasped at immortality
with the words, “Your verdict is nothing, you
play upon the court. You shall go together and
bring in another verdict, or you shall starve.”
The jury then voted acquittal time and again.
The judge tired of this obstinacy, remanded
Penn and Mead to prison, ﬁned the members
of the jury and ordered the imprisonment of
the jury until the ﬁnes were paid.

The point is, although the prosecution of
William Penn was highly unfair, it was also
very swift. Swift justice gives those who mete.
it out undue inﬂuence over the process of jus-
tice. The jury system, by requiring-12 people
to convict somebody and by rendering deci-
sions overlonger periods of time, removes this
damaging brand of individual power.

Sometimes slow justice is the best way to
make sure justice is done. So don’t let Nancy’s
new show convince you otherwise.

Here’s a challenge: Name a Cuban ﬁlm. Can’t‘
do it? Try naming a Latin American movie that
doe_sn’t involve Gael Garcia Bernal,_Guillermo
del Toro or Pedro Almodovar.

If you came up with an answer, odds are

‘ you either know the Spanish language or

you’re a cinephile with omnivorous tastes,
or both. For those who failed, it’s pretty safe
to assume Cuban cinema is a great unknown
to you. ‘

Pitt’s Center for Latin American Studies, in
conjunction with the Department of Hispanic
Languages and Hillman Library’s Eduardo
Lozano Latin American Collection, will work
now through Dec. 9 to provide the public a
taste of what it’s missing.

One of the highlights of series will come
tonight. Director Luciano Labrobina will be in

the Frick Fin'e‘Arts Building for a reception at
6 p.m. At 6:30 p.m., people can view his ﬁlm
“HavanYork” in the building’s auditorium.
“HavanYork” explores the current Cuban hip-
hop counterculture. .
Martha Mantilla, head of the Lozano col-
lection and coordinator of the “Cuban Eyes/
Cubanize” series, said those who attend the

series’ screenings will savor a vision of Cuba

and Cuban-American relations that they will
probably not ﬁnd elsewhere.

“I think [the American people] know the - .

Cuban revolution, because it was so big for
American history. The cinema, not so much,”
Mantilla said. ' ‘

Mildred Lopez, a Pitt grad student and
volunteer series organizer, echoed Mantilla’s
sentiment, saying that “to watch these ﬁlms
is a huge opportunity to see other aesthetics,
other ways of life.”

More speciﬁcally, the series will introduce
attendees to Cuban cinema’s distinctive treat-
ment of art and politics — especially politics.
Through methods of indirection, Cuban direc-
tors have been able to bypass government-
imposed strictures to create sophisticated
works of what Pitt’s Center for Latin American
Studies calls “socially responsible cinema.”

As an example, Mantilla cites Tomas

‘ Seeing through ‘Cuban Eyes’

Courtesy Mildred Lopez
Cuban director Tomas Gutierrez Alea used various devices, like allegory, to share banned social and political commentary in his ﬁlms.

Gutierrez Alea’s “Fresa y Chocolate,” which
uses allegory to call attention to Castro’s ho-

mophobia. Without these creative strategies,

ﬁlmmakers would be reduced to rehashing
strictly government-doctrinal representa-
tions of gender, sexuality and race -relations in
Cuba — three issues that merit addressing.

The late Alea will be the series’ dedicatee
because he was among the" ﬁrst to recognize
the revolutionary potential of the ﬁlm medium
in the wake of Fidel Castro’s coup against Ful-
gencio Batista; Alea “developed the grammar
of Cuban ﬁlm,” Lopez said.

During his long career, he critiqued Cas-
tro’s legacy through deeply ambivalent movies
that draw from traditionsas diverse as Soviet
montage, religious parable, surrealism and
early American physical comedy. Too self-
reﬂexive to be propagandistic, Alea’s ﬁlms
are accomplished works of subtle, politically
committed direction. . .

“Cuban Eyes/Cubanize” will also host Mir-
ta Ibarra, wife of the late Alea, at the screening
of her husband’s ﬁlm, where she will discuss
his work and entertain any other questions
concerning Cuban ﬁlmmaking. Ibarra will

In 90 minutes, Quantum Theater will take its
audience through 90 years of two ﬁctional fami-
lies’ histories. '

Known for taking theatrical shows out of a
normal theater setting, Quantum Theater will
present “When the Rain Stops Falling” by An-
drew Bovell in a warehouse near the Iron City
Brewery. It’s located in what director Martin
Giles jokingly described as “‘some weird place
down in the bowels of Bloomﬁeld.”

Though he has acted with various groups
in Pittsburgh, Giles came onto the project as a
director because of the way he could visualize
the show while reading the play’s script.

“I was reading it, and I was seeing it,” he ’

said.

The show follows seven people and several
generations from the 1950s through to the future
of 2039. Two families pass down “the follies and
pain of the previous generation to the next,” and
they go through their lives, Giles said.

Even though the approach goes beyond or-
dinary theater, “When The Rain Stops Falling”
itself is a very typical, beautiful play, he said.

“It’s not a bizarre, radical thing,” he said.
“It’s beautiful and sad, and the ending is slightly
upliﬁing because it says we can change if we be-
come aware enough, and we’re kind enough.”

“The interesting thing is [the writer] makes
everything happen at the same time,” Giles said.
“He’s Australian and knows about dream time,
the idea of how the past is always present. The
generations of the family, you see their stories
and how they overlap.” V

MUSIC COLUMN

South African flavor

South African hip-hop gains popularity in the United States

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

International hip -hop acts are beginning
to work their way into the American music
pallet. .

In 2008, M.I.A. released Kala, a break-
through album that heralded in a new era
of hip-hop. After strong reviews and several
commercial uses of the song “Paper Planes,”
M.I.A.’s brand of globally aware rhymes and
rhythms had everyone from rap aﬁcionados
to drunken party girls singing along to “the
boom boom song.” Two years later, another
global hip-hop group from South Africa has
come to show the United States that therap
game is played globally as well. ' ’

Die Antwoord and its co-conspirator in
musical world domination,Jack Parow, both
create hip-hop infused with local languages
and social commentary from one of the most
diverse areas in the world. Die Antwoord calls
its style Zef, a South African term. Zef artists

address contemporary issues in genre that -

stereotypically appeals to a working class,
while infusing elements of hip-hop.

The rap-rave crew named Die Antwoord
— Afrikaans for “the answer” — is composed

of main MC Ninja, supporting MC/vocalist
Yo—Landi Vi$$er and a maker of “next level
beats on his PC computer” named DJ Hi-Tek.
The band formed in 2008 but didn’t really
take off until the videos for “Enter The Ninja”
and “Zef Side,” which features a portion of its
song “Beat Boy,” went viral on the Internet
earlier this year. That allowed the group to
tour the U.S. festival circuit while garnering
signiﬁcant media buzz.

The group’s music and over—the-top image
have lead many to ask whether Die Antwoord
is a serious creative outlet or just some strange
parody. But in recent interviews Ninja has
made it clear that although “Ninja” is a per-
sona, it’s ultimately him, and the band’s music
is authentic as well. ..

This month, the band released its U.S.
debut album, ,8‘O¢$’— pronounced SOS. To co-
incide with its release, the band has unleashed
its craziest song to date, a Diplo—produced
track called “Evil Boy.” The video —— which I

insist everyone see at least once —— is one of =

the strangest expressions of Die Antwoord’s
decidedly NSFW aesthetic yet, and its execu-

S tion is genius.

Play a twist on classic

Prime Stage adapts ‘lhe Legend of Sleepy Hollow ’ for stage

Directed by Mark A. Calla

New Hazlett Theater, Allegheny Square

Purchase at proartstickets.org or call
412-394-3353 f ‘

Director Mark Calla wasn’t a fan of
Washington Irving’s novel “The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,” but after some urg-
ing, he took on the job of directing an
adaptation. '

Under Ca1la’s' direction, Prime Stage
Theatre will put on its own version of
“The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”

In its show, the story starts out in
the present with children telling ghost
stories, using flashbacks to tell Ichabod
Crane’s story. After overlooking the ma-
terial for the play, Calla was pleasantly
surprised.

“The script is fairly true to the origi-

nal,” he said. “The way we made [the play]

"is expanding on it. To make it playable on

the stage as a play, not a retelling, was to
try to create some greater depth to the
main character.” _

Calla and the playwright, F.J. Hartland,
worked together to make Crane a his-
tory not found in the original material,
explaining why the “goofy, oddball and
quirky teacher” is the way he is, giving
him reasons for his behavior.

Brian Czarniecki, who plays Crane,
joined the talks to learn more about the
expanded character.

_ “There are scenes with his parents and
flashbacks to his childhood,” Czarniecki
said. “It’s interesting to see the ﬂash-
backs  There’s his childhood and his
adult life in Sleepy Hollow. It’s a cod-
dling mother and dominating father and
how they formed who he is. When he’s

Cuban 4 8

introduce “Titon: De La Habana a Guantana-
mera,” a documentary about Alea.

Mantilla stresses that the ﬁlms in the series
offer a wholly Cuban view of Cuba, suggesting

that our distance from Cuban affairs in some '

sense compromises our ability to understand
Cubans’ self image. For example, our Holly-
wood-inﬂuenced notion of how ﬁlm produc-
tion works corresponds poorly to the less
glamorous conditions under which movies
like Alea’s “Memories of Underdevelopment”
or Gloria Rolando’s “Roots of_My Heart” were
' made.’ , _

This is not to say that all the ﬁlms in the
series are low-budget art house fare —— “Fresa
y Chocolate” is an international co-production
that grossed millions —— but rather that the

’ behind—the—scenes history of these works is as

. rich as the national history they dramatize.

Mantilla says that, despite the greater vis-
ibility of its commercial successes, Cuban
cinema is primarily about “maximizing lim-

Films show taboo views  

ited resources.”

Emphasizing this theme, “Cuban Eyes/ A

Cubanize” will pay tribute to Instituto Cubano
del Arte y la Industria Cinematographicos, a
cinema collective co—founded by a number
of directors featured in the series, which this
year celebrates its 50th anniversary.

“It was one of the leading institutions in
Latin America because it started to do ﬁlm
as an art — ﬁlm as an expression of inequal-

. ity, a means of speaking about difference,”

Lopez said.
Indeed, it is the sheer variety of ways in

which political commitments ﬁnd cinematic ’
, expression that interested persons can most

look forward to in “Cuban Eyes/Cubanize.”
. Mantilla and Lopez place a high valuation
on the power of cinema to bring the political

_ dimensions of Cuban ciilture into sharp and

compelling focus.
As Lopez put it, “In cinema, ﬁlmmakers
open a new space for conversation.” I

Quantum spans generations

This means that there are moments where
the audience can see two moments in time at
once and how one affects the other. The show
also examines how the actions of the people
affect the world overall. '

‘-‘The other part of the idea is that what you

do makes the world,” Giles said. “Ifwe continue .
to behave badly and not treat each other well, '

we’re destroying the world. Every interpersonal

reaction affects the world and its stability.”
The show is an interpersonal and global

commentary ratherthan apolitical one, accord:

ing to artistic director and Quantum Theater l

founder Karla Boos.
“The play is interestingfor younger people,”

Boos said. “There are amazingyoungcharacters r

who are at moments in their life where things
could go one way or another. They can’t com-
pletely control their destiny since things witl1
their ancestors come into play in their lives. It’s
an interesting aspect: It’s community.

“You see how they are eventually able to ‘

move forward from a chain that seems present
in their lives. Somebody in 2039 changes this
course. The play ends on awonderful note that’s
about change.”

Giles has overseen construction of the set“

and taken part in the evolvingvision ofthe show
from the beginning. With Quantum Theater,

the set of the play is as important as the show '

itself, Boos said. .

“In general,‘we feel there’s something about
how an audience experiences the play that is
an active contributor to what they get from it,”
Boos said. “So we choose the site that lets us
use something speciﬁc for that experience. This
play has two things. It has a personal story of
a family over generations, and that’s huge the
way any personal story is huge. And the play
has ideas that have to do with the environment
and how people relate to the planet: We wanted

- this play in a giant place so we could reference

these issues.”
The facility offers the chance for large props

and backgrounds as well as massive projections
. of night skies over the audience. _

_ Running the show outside, of atheater is
not simple. The directors are in charge of sim-
ple things like heating, and as Pittsburgh gets
chillier, it’s just one more thing to keep an eye
on, Boos said. V '

“We wouldn’t do this if we didn’t believe in
the art,” Boos said. “It  much more difﬁcult
and expensive than normal theater.”

On the other hand, after'20 years in this
business, Boos describes the crew as veterans
and experts in the craft.

’ “Now we know what the questions to ask
are,” Boos said about setting up. “The ﬁrst shows

weren’t so ambitious. We once wouldn’t have ’

dreamed of puttingthings likethis on. But that’s

Hip=hop ( 9

Shifting between numerous faux—boners,
District 9-inspired creatures and more surreal
sexual imagery than you can shake a penis-
microphone at, “Evil Boy” has substance. It
is actually about the featured guest Wanga’s
rejection of his ethnic group’s circumcision
ritual and how he embraced his social boy-
hood as a means of protecting himself from
what he sees as a dangerous practice.

This juxtaposition of sheer absurdity and

a smart social comment isn’t unique to Die

Antwoord. But,‘in a time when serious hip-
hop can feel like a rare thing, it’s a breath
of fresh air to hear musicians from a differ-
ent culture take on a traditionally American
musical form and make it their own. Ninja,
Yo-Landi and DJ Hi-Tek aren’t the only ones
in South Africa’s rap game, though, and their
Zef colleague Jack Parow is equally ready to
take over the world. .

Wearing a 2—foot ﬂat brim hat and rapping

' almost exclusively in Afrikaans, Parow is an

MC who might look like a fool_if he didn’t de-
liver his rhymes with so much cool. Although
Parow has stayed a bit more under the radar

t H internationally than media-favorites Die Ant-

woord, his star—power has been increasing
in South Africa ‘since he released his debut
EP Coo/er as Bkzée last December. That song’s

customers decide to act “too cool” and mess
with him while they order. As “The Parow”
emerges, the 2-foot brim on his hat still note-
worthy, he begins to decry everyone who is
too cool to have a good time.

. Moving -with an incredibly smooth ﬂow
over a drum and guitar sample, he dances
With’ hot girls, grills‘ meat with his friends,
ghost—rides his car and throughout reinforces
the idea that hip -hop should sometimes laugh
at itself.Parow is the deﬁnition of cool and,
despite how normal this all might sound for
a hip-hop video, C00/er a:,E,é,ée is a perfect

_ example of how hip-hop isn’t just an inter-

national phenomena, but a multi‘-lingual on
as well. . - 

Zef’s hip-hop artists might never reach-

the same proportions of fame as the legends
of the U.S. rap game, but that’s not for a lack
of talent, by any means. Both Die Antwoord

of Katrina.”

Of course, the Headless Horseman
plays a key role, as well.

“Even in the story, he might exist or
mightnot, yet he is a legendary ﬁgure,
even to the people ofthe time,” Calla said.
“He is the archetype of boogeyman sto-
ries. He is the thing in the dark that will
grab you if you’re not careful. More than
Crane, the Horseman made this story
last.” . _

Calla made some adjustments for this
adaptation of the show but wouldn’t re-

veal his tricks for bringing the Headless ’

Horseman to life on stage.
“There is no way to describe what

we do ‘without giving something away,”.

Calla said. “I think what the script did is
unique. I want people to experience it by
seeing it and hearing it.”

Calla also put effort into giving the
play an atmosphere rather than just a
script. This is the only thing he would
reveal about his method of dealing with
the spooky character. ' I

~“0ne of the things that has always
bothered me about stage versions is they
become very talky,” Calla said. “There
is almost no story to use to drive it in

the original story. The original is about

W5 A ‘raammca

NO omen

atmosphere. Putting a literal actor on
stage has always fallen short. So I think
something that we did was to create a
Horseman in people’s minds instead of
seeing a literal ﬁgure who we know is a
costume.”

Not all the challengesin the play are
character—related — some are purely
physical.

“I think the biggest challenge for all
of us is performing on a multi-level set,”
Czarniecki said. f‘The set has platforms,
and the set is going to be a cemetery, in
different levels. We rehearse on a ﬂat
space, though, trying to imagine the dif-
ferent levels. We try to keep this in mind.
There will be different obstacles on the"
real set.”,

The people involved are excited to'“

bring what they consider a seasonal folk— '
tale to the stage with the twist of their
own additions.

“It’s a classic,” Czarniecki said. “It’s
an American classic folktale. So many
people know a version of this story. My
mother reminded me that I saw an .ani—
mated Disney film based on this years
ago. A lot of kids have heard this story,
just like the kids in the play. Going back
to these folktales is always fun.” ,

“FOOTBALL

Hutchins effective as kicker, punter

~ -1» Isaac Saul

For the Pitt News

In college football, being a place-kicker can be
a terrifyingjob.

One kick can deﬁne your career or cost you
your spot on the team. It can be the difference
between awin and aloss, a National Champion-
ship and second place. One snap, one hold and
one kick can change everything.

. Just a couple weeks ago, the New Orleans
Saints — the defending Super Bowl champi-

‘ “"ons — swapped kickers after a usually steady

Garrett Hartley missed what would have been
a game-winning 29-yard ﬁeld goal.

The result?

His replacement,John Carney, missed a kick
of exactly 29 yards the following week against
Arizona. Consistency, at all levels of kicking, is
the name of the game. , .

Pitt has one of the nation’s best in senior
Dan Hutchins. Hutchins, who was an All—Big
East kicker last year and led the conference in
scoring, ﬁeld goals and ﬁeld goal percentage,
is even more unique for what he does when the

H "Panthers aren’t in ﬁeld goal range: punting.

That’s because Hutchins is one of the few
dual punter and kicker specialists in the na-
tion.

Hutchins gives a lot ofhis credit to the people
around him.

A big part of his success, he says, is work-
ing with Buddy Morris and James Smith, two
of Pitt’s strength and conditioning coaches,
during the offseason, a big factor in increasing
leg strength.

“The weight room is a big deal,”’Hutchins

 said.

He also ﬁnds council in a couple of NFL
notables, including Pat McAfee, a Pittsburgh
native and former West Virginia Mountaineer
who now punts for the Indianapolis Colts. An-
other Pennsylvania local, Robbie Gould, who
was a place-kicker for Penn State and now the
Chicago Bears, gave Hutchins some inspiration
as a middle-schooler.

“That was kind of the goal I had as a young
kid,” Hutchins said. “Especially ﬁnishing middle
school, going into high school, being competitive
at a young age and just having a strong leg.”

Hutchins says he splits his time evenly be-
tween kicking and punting.

“I know that I can’t just slack off in kicking
ﬁeld goals or in punting. I have to take them
both seriously,” he said.

Although his time on the practice ﬁeld be-
tween kicking and punting is divided evenly,

“Hutchins isn’t shy about where his comfort

zone is.

TONY’S TOP 10

Best Pitt
games in
The Pitt
News pt. 2

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Editor’s Note: This is the second part of a
special two-part Tony’s Top 10 celebrating
100 years of The Pitt News.

The Pitt News is celebrating its centen-
nial this week. So I will join the festivities
by celebrating both The Pitt News and Pitt
football.

For this week’s top 10, I give you the
best Pitt football games in the history of
The Pitt News.In addition to summary of
the game, I’ve also provided a brief para-
graph or two that ran in The Pitt News
after that game. Pitt football certainly has
a lot of history, but it is also interesting to
see how the newspaper’s language evolved
over the years.

Games 10 through six ran in yesterday’s

print edition and can then be found on

pittnews.com. _

So, in chronological order, here are the
five greatest Pitt football games of the last
100 years. .

5. Pitt 24 - Penn State 7. Nov. 26, 1976,
Three Rivers Stadium.‘ '

The 1976 season was obviously a special
one for the Panthers. It was a season full
of highs, such as when Pitt defeated No.
2 Navy at home and the public-address
announcer informed the crowd that No. 1
Michigan had just lost to Purdue. Panther
fans erupted, chanting “We’re No. 1.” _

But perhaps the biggest win of the 1976
regular season was the 24-7 trouncing of

Penn State at Three Rivers Stadium. Tony

Dorsett ﬁnished with 224 yards and two
touchdowns, and the Panthersﬁnished
11-0 for thefirst time in Pitt football his-
tory. And, oh yeah, it was the first time
Pitt ever defeated a team coached by Joe
Paterno. -

THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

It’s nice to see new teams winning

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Stajf Writer

 

Boston Red Sox. Philadelphia Phillies. New
York Yankees.

These are the pastthree winners ofthe World
Series, the baseball powerhouses: the boring,
the expected, the rich and the powerﬁil.

The Yankees checked in at No. 1 on the 2010
baseball total payroll list. The Red Sox were No.
2, and the Phillies were the lowest of the three
at No. 4. It’s no wonder that at the beginning
of this season, most assumed that one of these
teams would be the last standing.

After all, it’s been that way forthe past three
years. Last year, we got the added bonus of
watching the overexposed faces of the Phillies
face off against the overexposed faces of the
Yankees. V V

But tonight, baseball fans are getting some-
thing diiferent. That’s because the World Series
begins tonight between two teams that aren’t
supposed to be there.

I, for one, can’t wait.

Team No. 1: the Texas Rangers.

The Rangers are playingintheir ﬁrst World
Series in the 49-year history of the franchise.
They have the fourth lowest payroll in baseball
above only the Oakland Athletics, the San Diego

Padres and our very own Pittsburgh Pirates.

They’ve got one of the best players in the
game,Josh Hamilton, whose arms are covered
with more tattoos thanmost people on “LA Ink,”
who struggled with injury and drug addiction
throughout his career and missed nearly four
years on the ﬁeld between battling the two.

Hamilton often tells the story of his re-
covery: about ﬁnding faith, ﬁnding God and
eventually ﬁnding his way to becoming one of
baseball’s superstars. -

Some might condemn him forhis past, and
if that’s the way you think, then so be it. But
Hamilton’s so incredibly grounded that it’s hard
not to root for him. He’s so far from arrogant
he can’t even see Alex Rodriguez from where
he’s standing. '

Hamilton isn’t the only person in a Rang-
ers uniform who received another opportu-
nityfrom the franchise. Rangers manager Ron
Washington tested positive for cocaine during
the 2009 season.

Washington admittedhis mistake and apolo-
gized, even telling his bosses and the commis-
sioner’s ofﬁce that he wouldfailthe test before
the results became known. .

The Rangers didn’t ﬁre Washington. And

Games against Pitt’s rivals top the list T

Pitt ’s most recent win against Penn State and epic 1359-hoin over West Virginia come in at No. 2 and No. 1

_]ovenitti< 14

the major polls, the Lambert Trophy as
number one in the East, a Heisman Trophy
winner, a trip to New Orleans, a possible

coach of the year and a national champi- '

onship staring them in the face — what else
could the Pitt Panthers want?

Well, a victory over Penn State would
have been the topping, so the Panthers’
24-7 clawing of the Nittany Lions last Fri-
day not only magniﬁed all of Pitt’s other
distinctions, but restored a sense of pride
to the team which had fallen the previous
10 years to their cross-state rivals.

4. Pitt 27 — Georgia 3. Jan. 1, 1977,
Superdome. .

This was the game that capped every-
thing off for the Panthers’ 1976 season.
After No. 1 Pitt defeated Penn State to
ﬁnish 11-0, the Panthers were invited to
New Orleans to face No. 2 Georgia in the
Sugar Bowl. Pitt simply, dom-i—nat“ed” the
Bulldogs and left ‘f1’6'd0ubt that it was the
best team in the country.

TPN, Wed., Jan 5, 1977: Forty years is
a long, long time to wait for a champion-
ship —~ just ask the Pittsburgh Steelers. But
it’s worth it. You stand there perplexed,
goose bumps blanketing your body, and

you don’t know whether to laughor cry
from the feeling of satisfaction.

3. Pitt 37 — Notre Dame 27. Nov. 13,
1999, Pitt Stadium.

Remember how I felt about Civic Arena
last year? Well, take that and multiply it
by 10. That’s how Pitt fans felt about Pitt
Stadium in 1999, the historic venue’s ﬁnal
season. Pitt demolished the 74-year-old
stadium just a month after the ﬁnal game
was played.

It was an emotional night as Pitt de-
feated Notre Dame by 10 points.

TPN, Mon., Nov 15, 1999: When Pitt
Stadium was ﬁnally empty Saturday, Pitt
was missing two goal posts, shards of turﬁ.
a bench or two, and some signs, but it had
a victory.

The Panthers defeated Notre Dame

_ ,37-27, in the ﬁnal game at Pitt Stadium

in front of 60,190 fans. The crowd was
the eighth largest in stadium history and
the largest since 1983, when .the Panthers
played rival Penn State. S

2. Pitt 12 - Penn State 0. Sept. 16,
2000, Three Rivers Stadium.

It seems a shame that some of the more
recent “best games in Pitt history” are

celebrating “lasts.” Less than a year after
Pitt played the emotionalﬁnal game at
Pitt Stadium, the Panthers played another
emotional ﬁnal game —- this time against
Penn State.

After Pitt chose to stick with the Big
East and Penn State decided to ruin the
math for the Big Ten, one of the best ri-
valries in college football came to an end.
But Pitt got the last laugh.

TPN, Mon., Sept. 18, 2000: So long.
Farewell. Goodbye.

For the last time in the foreseeable ﬁt-
ture, Joe Paterno and his Nittany Lions
left Pittsburgh Saturday with no bragging
rights and no points on the scoreboard
as Pitt trounced Penn State 12-0 in ﬁ'ont
of a crowd of 61,221 at Three Rivers Sta-
dium.

1. Pitt 13 — West Virginia 9. Dec. 1,
2007, Milan Puskar Stadium

Going into the ﬁnal week of the 2007
season, West Virginia was No. 2. All it
needed to do was beat a dismal 4-7 Pitt
team to earn a trip to the national cham-
pionship game. —

After the Pitt-Penn State rivalry be-
came dormant, the Backyard Brawl quickly

grew bigger and bigger, and this game -
the 100th edition of the rivalry — only
added to the ﬁre. Literally. Pitt won 13-9,

and a small riot consumed Oakland, with’

people lighting couches on fire to taunt
Mountaineer fans who were infamous for
burning couches.

TPN, Sun., Dec. 2, 2007: The 100th
Backyard Brawl was supposed to be a mere
formality — 60 tedious minutes of foot-
ball against pushover Pitt stood between
West Virginia and its best shot ever at a
national title.

Instead, it will go down as the rivalry’s
biggest upset.

The Mountaineers, without quarter-

back Pat White for nearly half the game, *0’

imploded, and Pitt did the impossible,

. knocking oﬁ"No. 2-ranked West Virginia
’ 13-9 and squashingits national champion-
‘ ship hopes on Saturday at Milan Puskar

Stadium.

Giants, Rangers easy to support

 4 15

as you can see, he made the most of his second
chance.

Hate on Hamilton and Washington for their
pasts if that’s what you choose — or if you’re

» a Yankees fan and you’re bitter. Me? I couldn’t

be happier to see them moving on from their
mistakes to the sport’s biggest stage.

But there’s another team playing in this
World Series, too, and it’s just as likable: the
San Francisco Giants.

, Giants manager Bruce Bochy called the
group “a bunch of castoffs and misﬁts.” And,
in a way, tl1at’s exactly what it is.

Gone are the years of the admittedly great
but also conceited and disrespectful Barry
Bonds.

Instead, the Giants have Tim Lincecum,
the star pitcher with the long locks who looks
like he should be going to a high school prom
instead of throwing in the World Series. Then
there’s the rookie catcher who bats cleanup.
His name is Buster. Buster Posey, to be exact.
Enough said.

The team is made of several players getting
what could be their last chance. But Aubrey Huff
and his $3 million free agency contract and Pat
Burrell checked their ‘egos at the door.

In]uly,‘Burrell wasn’t even playingbaseball
aﬁerbeing released by the Phillies. But like the

Rangers, the Giants seem to be big on second
chances.

Outﬁelder Cody Ross wanted to be a rodeo
clown when he was little; now he’s a National
League Championship Series MVP. Brian Wil-
son’s black-as-night beard looks like it belongs
on a Halloween costume and not on the face of
afeared closer. The Giants switch around their
lineup like it’s a game of mix and match.

It’s a team full of underdogs. And if there’s
one thing that sports fans love, it’s anunderdog.
If that’s not enough to make this World Series
interesting to Pittsburgh, the Giants are home
to former Pirate Freddy Sanchez. Come on,
Pittsburgh, you know you still love Freddy.

So, you can have your Bostons, New Yorks
and Philadelphias. I’ll take the Rangers mak-
ing antlers withstheir hands when a teammate
steals a base — because theygran like a deer,

their heads, wondering howa guy so skinny can

I’ll take the misﬁts and the little guys over
the superstars of the teams we all expected to
be here. ‘

Give me goofy, give me that feel-good story.
I’ll enjoy watching a World Series and debating

Hutchins strives for consistency

Hutchins '( 14

“I’m a kicker—turned-punter. I’m still more
of a ﬁeld goal guy, because of my size. But when
I’m able to punt, get out on the ﬁeld, I try to
be serious. Let’s pin them back there and get
some hang time,” said the 5’11” 19o—pound
Hutchins. '

Place—l<ickers are put in some of the highest
pressure positions of the 22 guys on the ﬁeld.
Everyone has his own way ofhandling that pres-
sure, and Hutchins ﬁnds his conﬁdence in what
he has accomplished.

“Any time I go out there, I have to think
about my teammates, what I’ve been through
as a person, my family andthis family here at

Pittsburgh,” he said. “It’s_almost like I go out.

there for them. I put a lot of it on myself.”
Hutchins, who made his way onto the team
as a wa]k—on, has impressed a lot of people by
working hard. But in the end, the good and the
bad aspects of Pitt’s football performance can’t

be solely placed on Dan Hutchins’ shoulders -

because the holders, longsnappers and linemen

are all integral parts of successﬁilly getting a’

ﬁeld goal or punt off. I
Holder-and backup quarterback Andrew
janocko, had nothing but praise for Hutchins.
“One thing I’ve learned from being around
kickers‘ is that kicking is something very chal-
lenging mentally,” Janocko said. “You’re cold,
you’re on the sideline, and then you have to
come right into the game and make a play.
People don’t expect you to do anything but

make the play.” ‘ I .

Hutchins has been named the Big East spe— I

cial teams Player of the Week twice already
this season, and he leads the league in punting

with a46.8 yard average as well as in ﬁeld goals '

made with 12.

But even with his consistency and talent,
‘every player has his off- days. A few Weeks ago,
Hutchins and the special teams unit missed two
opportunities at three points at Notre Dame.
One; came on a botched snap and the other on
an uncharacteristic miss from 27 yards.

“Right now, you think I’d be out there, kick-
ing a million from the right hash, 27 yards,”
Hutchins said. “But I’ve been through that situ-
ation so many times on the practice ﬁeld, that’s
just on myself. I messed it up. I knewwhat I did
wrong as soon as it happened.”

But since that game Hutchins is a perfect

_ three—for.-three on ﬁeld goals and is averaging

just over 48 yards per punt. .

“Dan is very headstrong. All the attention
he gets, and the success that he is having and
will continue to have is very well deserved,”
Janocko said. “He cares aboutthis program and
the University and what we represent.”

Hutchins has a degree in communication
and plans to ﬁnish a second one in criminal
justice. But what’s next after his time at Pitt
is over?

“Well,” Hutchins said. “I’d like to chase the

dream.” I
