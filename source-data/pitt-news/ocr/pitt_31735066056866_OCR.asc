Its called the Blizzard of ‘95.

Along the east coast from Florida
to Maine, snow storms and winds
4 some up to 100 mph— hit, and
hit hard.

Many states literally shut down.
In Pennsylvania, Governor Robert
Casey declared a state of emer-
gency on Saturday, closing the
turnpike and all major highways
and interstates.

With runways buried at
Pittsburgh International Airport, all
ﬂights were cancelled and thou-
sands of travelers stranded
overnight. I

The city declared a snow emer-
gency, urging people to stay inside
and oil“ the roads. PennDOT road
crews fought a losing battle as over
two feet of snow fell in 24 hours, at
times as much as three inches
falling in an hour.

Port Authority Transit parked its
buses around 4 p.m. Saturday
afternoon. Train and trolly service
came to a grinding halt. It seemed
that the only vehicles on the road
belonged to PennDOT.

Local newscasts report that the
statewide death toll from the bliz-
zard is at 27. In Allegheny County,

Amid rising controversy
over crime on campus,
Pitt’s public safety director
resigned Friday.

The departure of Director
William Brennan is the lat-
est blow to a department
which has faced rising
crime, declining personnel
and increased pressure to
resolve campus safety
issues.

John C. DeVitto, assistant
vice chancellor for busi-
ness, said that he was not
sure why Brennan ended
his four—year term.

“I don’t know what was
in his mind,” DeVitto said.
“It didn’t particularly come
as a surprise but it never
comes as a surprise when
people leave. People come
and go.”

Assistant Director Walt
Waters will take over the
department until a perma-
nent director is found.
Waters said the change
came as a surprise to him.

“I only found out Friday

Safety Director Brennan
resigns over Spring Break

so I’m just getting my feet
wet at this point,” he said.

Waters, who has been
with the university since
1969, served as interim
director after former
Director William Tucker
resigned in 1988.

Brennan, a 19-year veter-
an of the Philadelphia
Police Department, was
chosen to replace Tucker
early in 1989. He took over
during an upswing in crime
on campus.

The rate of violent on-
campus crimes jumped
from 10 in 1987 to 48 in
1992. During the same peri-
od, the department lost at
least 10 officers and super-
visors to attrition.

After two students were
raped near the Pitt campus
during the summer of 1990,
the university community
became increasingly con-
cerned about campus safe-
ty.

Rising assaults and rapes
prompted Pitt to form a
task force on public safety
in 1992, which suggested

for Monday. Pitt cancelled classes,
but the university itself was open.
In the area, Point Park College and
Duquesne University also can-

celled class.

reported that classes were can-

Students stranded
in Panama City Beach

The Pitt News

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. --
There wasn’t any snow on the
ground, but 150 Pitt students in
Panama City Beach felt the impact
of what is being called the “winter
stomr of the century.”

The Pitt Program Council’s
Spring Break group was forced to
stay over Saturday and Sunday
due to the storm that brought bliz-
zards, tomadoes and high winds
up and down the east coast.
Weather and road conditions tem-
porarily ruled out a bus trip back
to Pittsburgh.

Students making their way
south from the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee described
the terrible road conditions they
fought on Friday and Satmday in
Alabama.

Wisconsin sophomore Chris
Simons said that the roads were lit-
tered with trucks and cars stuck in
the snow.

“It was like a burial ground,”
Simons said.

The worst area the group drove
through was Birmingham, Ala.,
where students said there was at
least a foot of snow. Traveling to

Montgomery, about 90 miles
away, took six hours. The group
managed around 25 miles per
hour, and many times the traffic
stopped completely.

With reports of snow conditions
back home, most Pitt students said
they were happy to be in Panama
City.

“I don’t want to go home,” Pitt
junior Danielle Marro said. “I
talked to my dad, there’s four feet
of snow in my yard. I’d rather be
here.”

“The longer you stay, the more
you want to stay here,” senior
Royer Kluchki said. “If you’re
going to have to wait out the
storm, this is the place to 

Not everybody wanted to stay in
the sun, though. Pitt student Barry
Gavasto said he has a project due
Tuesday, midterms Wednesday
and Thursday and a speech on
Friday. ’

“I must get back and get my
work done,” he said.

PPC advisor T om Misuraca, who
coordinated the trip, said that Pitt
students would not be charged for
the extra nights they were forced
to spend at the Holiday Inn.

“If the university’s got to spend
the money to insure the safety of
its students, that’s okay,” he said.

Pitt Program Council called
it sexually degrading to
women. The vice chancellor
for student affairs said it was
in bad taste. Artist David
Brown said it is a Freudian
interpretation of male sexu-
ality.

Now people will be able to
decide for themselves about
Brown’s painting of a tree
consisting of male genitalia.

A few hours after art stu-
dent David Brown filed suit
against the university
Thursday, Pitt decided to
allow his painting to hang in
an upcoming student art
show.

The PPC Art Committee
found itself plunged into
controversy after rejecting

Pitt allows Brown's
controversial piece

the work two weeks ago.
The local branch of the
American Civil Liberties
Union took up the case for
Brown.

The PPC committee said
the nine foot by five foot
painting was too difficult to
hang because of its size and
because it could be seen
from the windows of the
Conney M. Kimbo gallery.
Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Harmon said
the painting was rejected
because it did not reflect the
image that the PPC wanted
to display.

When confronted with the
threat of an ACLU lawsuit,
the university did not back
down. The all-female art
committee re-evaluated the
work and decided it was sex-

Krenn rocks Oakland

By Matt Serlin
Senior Staﬂ‘Pbotograpber

Working four-and-a—half hours
a day, Jimmy Krenn said he
admits being a “goof off’ and that
he loves what he does.

The WDVE-FM radio disc jock-
ey brought his humor to a cheer-
ing crowd in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room March 11.

“My mom told me not to talk to
any of the gangs in Oakland,”
Krenn said.

Krenn described what it was
like growing up on Pittsburgh’s
South Side and added his experi-
ences at the Original Hot Dog
Shop.

“You were always drunk when
you went in there,” he explained.
“I could never remember what I
ordered.”

Krenn’s humor spared no one
from Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie
Masloff to actor Joe Pesci.

“I don’t like to get dirty, but you
have to when you do Pesci,”
Krenn said. “I would love to see
Pesci in The Wzard of Oz.”

Krenn talked about the transfor-
mation men go through when

Ist Annual

meeting women at parties.
“When you see the woman
across the room you’re like Steven

Segal, but by the time you work

your way up to the woman you’ve
become Elmer Fudd,” he joked.

One experience Krenn recalls
from childhood is being a 9-year-
old altar boy and not knowing the
Latin prayer he had to recite.

“I thought, I’ll make up my own
language. Maybe I can pull this
one off. I’ll never forget the look
on [the priest’sl face.”

Krenn said the most traumatic
things are always the funniest. He
recalled being told that bungee
jumping would be just like it
looked in the Mountain Dew
commercial.

“It was not a Mountain Dew
commercial, it was the parking lot
at Station Square,” he said.

Krenn said he plans to keep
doing stand—up around the coun-
try, but has no plans to leave his
morning job at WDVE.

“The [moming] show is tailor-
made for stand up,” Krenn said. “It
gives me a chance to work on
new material.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, March 16, 1993

Byjason Brame
Staff’ Writer

As strains of “For What It’s
Worth,” a ‘60’s song about
social and political change,
echoed in the background,
mayoral candidate Tom
Murphy entered the newly
occupied office and began to
talk with staffers and support-
ers.

Drawing volunteer support
for what he hopes will be an
era of growth after years of
social and economic shift in
Pittsburgh, Murphy said he
wants to identify and then rec-
tify the areas that have lagged
behind during the change.

“My campaigning is about
recognizing that Pittsbtngh is a
different city than it used to
be,” the Democratic state repre-
sentative said Thursday, March
11. “We need to build on those
new changes that have hap-
pened in Pittsburgh.”

The gathering last night was
to celebrate the opening of a
new student oﬂice on the cor-

ner of Forbes Avenue and
South Craig Street, from which
Murphy’s student campaign
will originate.

"We’re doing this as a means
to bring students together from
around Pittsburgh that are
interested,” student campaign
coordinator Josh Knauer said.
"|We also want] to expose stu-
dents to Tom."

Knauer, a Carnegie Mellon
student, helps aid Murphy in
his efforts to garner Oakland's
student population. If elected,
Murphy said he hopes to draw
the various communities of
Pitmburgh together.

“The city is really composed
of a lot of different villages, and
[the college communityl is part
of them,” he said. “The student
population is an important part
that I want to be able to reach
out and draw in to help shape
Pittsburgh.”

Joining students, profession-
als and non-professional voltm-
teers alike, Murphy’s grassroots
campaign “is like none this city
has ever seen before,” carn-

Student office campaigns for Murphy

paign stafferjudy Kelly said.

“He was Clintonesque before
we knew about Clinton," she
said of Murphy‘s door-to-door
campaign.

Kelly left a job as vice presi-
dent of a Boston firm to work
on Murphy’s campaign.

“I believe in him and this
city,” she said.

As a representative, Murphy
put together Strategy 21, a pro-
gram that brought money into
the Pittsburgh area to finance
such local establishments as
the Carnegie Science Center,
the Warhol Museum and the
new Pittsburgh International
Airport.

“We are starting to create job
opportunities in the high tech-
nology communities, and in
the financial, art and cultural
institutions in this region,”
Murphy said. “My interest is to
build the bridges for you to
those opportunities so that they
become very available and
very visible to you.”

celled to give students a chance to
return from Spring Break.

Parked cars along Oakland
streets were blocked in with two
and three feet of snow as plows
pushed to keep the roads drive-
able. Those trying to get on buses
climbed over slushy piles of dirty
snow.

Yesterday, Pitt senior grounds
manager Ed Gruber said he was
optimistic on the parking situation
on campus today.

“All the Pitt-owned lots will be
opened, maybe a little right
because of the snow,” Gl1ll)Cl'S’.ll(l.
“The real problem will be meter
parking.”

Gary Moses, assistant public
safety director, added that the
meter-linecl streets are the city of

Pittsbur‘gl‘r’s responsibility.

Students who planned on ﬂying
in Sunday night found that the air-
port had only one of its four run-
ways operational. The airlines
worked throughout Monday to
catch up on a backlog of depar-
tures and arrivals. .

All told, the National Weather
Service reports that 24.5 inches fell
on Allegheny County. And if
you’re hoping for spring (after all, it
was just Spring Break), its not
quite here yet.

The NWS forecast said it expects
it to stay fairly chilly and below
normal up until the end of the
week — some light snow tonight
and Wednesday.

Flcxrding may also be a problem
when all of this snow starts to
melt.

lawyers began to investigate
ways to reject the work legally.

Despite these efforts, Pitt
relented after the suit was filed
and decided to allow the work.

contains sexually explicit
imagery and that showing the
painting does not necessarily
constitute Pitt’s endorsement of
it.

Gunn shooting

Last Wednesday the battle over abortion rights took a turn for the
worst as Michael Griffin, an activist advocate of the pro-life movement,
shot and killed Dr. David Gunn.

Dr. Gunn worked in several different abortion facilities throughout
Florida, Georgia and Alabama. He was shot three times in the back as
he got out of his car outside the Pensacola Women’s Medical Services
Clinic.

Griffin has been charged with murder. He has chosen to act as his
own defense in the case, requesting nothing more than the right to hold
a Bible throughout the court proceedings. There is a strong amount of
irony in this situation — an individual so often refened to as “pro—life”
shot and killed a man.

The worst thing about this case is that Griffin could become the
poster child for the pro—life movement. While most activists no doubt
prefer the peaceful human chains and protests that are fundamental
examples of their right to free expression, Griffin’s actions are breeding
grounds for more violence and less tolerance among radical pro—life
activists.

Anti—abortion leaders for the most part came out in support of
Grifﬁn’s action. Randolph Terry, the leader of Operation Rescue, called
Grifﬁn’s act “repulsive,” but at the same time said that thousands of lives
would be saved. Some anti-abortion advocates were collecting money’
for Griffin, and they are now in the process of setting up a trust fund for
his family. Such “positive” responses encourage similar responses
throughout the country.

One has to wonder what the abortion battle is coming to. Gn'ff1n’s act
was sheer terrorism, and the failure of “pro—life” leaders to condemn his
actions is nothing less than outright approval. Recently confimied
Attorney General Janet Reno has pledged to fight these vicious acts.
And she should. While the rusty cogs of big government often hinder
the choices of individuals, this time intervention is necessary to ensure
the basic rights of women — namely control over their own bodies.

The right of an individual to make choices is a fundamental precept
of the United States Constitution. It is a shame that the battleground
between both sides of the abortion issue is at the level of the federal
government instead of individual conscience where it belongs.

Russian assistance

Nicolo Machiavelli wrote in The Prince that there is a difference
between what people do and what they ought to do. As leaders
from the G-7 nations (a summit consisting of the world’s seven
wealthiest countries) contemplate the situation in Russia, it is ques-_
tionable whether they will do what they should.

Thursday afternoon, The People’s Congress voted to curb Boris
Yeltsin’s power and cancel the referendum which would provide
an impetus for rapid economic change. The vote seriously puts into

jeopardy the Democratic reforms which have been instituted and

threatens to push Russia back to a Communist regime led by
Yeltsin’s major opponent Ruslan Khasbulatov.

Cancelling the referendum may have been an angel in disguise
for Yeltsin. A low voter turnout would have been seen as a victory
for Khasbulatov. Nevertheless, political problems continue to
plague Yeltsin, and it appears that no end is in sight. A renewed
struggle of power in Russia is everybody’s problem. The G-7
nations must provide assistance.

Good economics is usually good politics. However, aid to Russia
is not the only solution. Although the problems are not as simple as
opening foreign markets, as long as Western and Japanese politi-
cians continue to maintain closed doors on goods from Russia, the
pace of reform will be slow and increasingly dangerous for Yeltsin.
Stability and economic reform cannot come about simply by selling
products to poorer Russian consumers. It’s high time the politicians
do what they ought to do.

Provocative painting raises questions

David Brown handed the
university a powder keg, and
Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs William Harmon, along

~with the five members of the

PPC Art Committee, lit it with-
out hesitation. By the accounts
of The Pitt News, Brown sub-
mitted a painting, “There’s No
Place Like Hollidaysburg,” per-
haps best described as a penis
tree with a submissive female
attendant, for display in a stu-
dent art show.

After the PPC student panel
voted to deny the work’s entry
in the show, Vice Chancellor
Harmon, who says he held
veto power, vehemently
upheld the rejection. “There is
no attempt at censorship,” he
is quoted as saying, “but there
is an attempt at good taste.”
Most recently and most regret-
tably, the university is locking
horns with the ACLU in an
effort to keep Brown’s painting
out of the show. This transac-
tion reflects informatively on
this university as a haven for
both free expression and
enlightened thought.

In its mission to foster edu-
cation and research, Pitt also
serves a crucial mission as nur-
turer of an open forum for the
exchange of ideas. Students,
especially in the arts but in
other fields as ‘well, come here
to experiment creatively, pro-
ducing works which might not
find a voice in the profit-driven
commercial world. This is not
to say that Pitt needs to
endorse all creative efforts of
its students. It simply should
avoid stifling them. Pitt could
post disclaimers on some or
even all student work. Let the

other students, faculty, alumni,
staff and community respond
as part of the univer_sity experi-
ence rather than removi.ng the
opportunity for dialogue.

In rejecting “Thcre’s No
Place Like Hollidaysburg,”
(although I still encourage its
reinstatement in the show),
Vice Chancellor Harmon coun-
terproductively squelches the
exchange. _ Despite the many

Charles
Rosenblum

ways in which one could look
at this painting (gender issues
loom urgently, but other for-
mal, literary or cultural types of
inquiry would shed some light
as well ...), the university has
reduced the question to one of
censorship. Pitt hasn’t silenced
the artist; now he’s all over the
papers However, this pre-
emptive strike has stunted a
significant opportunity for
enlightened thought from the
university community.

This is not to say that such -

enlightenment comes from
David Brown. As agent provo-
cateur, he has succeeded; the
university naively took his bait.

However, as an artist, he has
failed — by drowning other
potential interpretations of his
work in an overt publicity
grab. This point is even more
significant because the paint-
ing (as it is hazily reproduced
in black and white) depicts a
woman in a resoundingly
misogynistic fashion. That
issue, as well as others,
deserves careful discussion in
an open forum. It should not

be the weapon by which all
freedom of expression at this
university is held hostage.

Only a few months ago,
Dennis Barrie, curator of
Cincinnati’s Center for
Contemporary Art, spoke at
the William Pitt Student Union
describing how he risked
going to prison over a show of
Robert Mapplethorpe’s contro-
versial photography. He
recounted how a non—expert
jury of Cincinnatians eventual-
ly ruled it illegal to bar art,
even sexually explicit art, from»;
this gallery display. Lastly, he:
exhorted the audience to be.
eternally vigilant in the cause?‘
of freedom of artistic expres-:'_
sion. 1]

Where was Vice Chancellor"?
Harmon when Barrie spoke sd
eloquently? Although there are
admitted differences in the two
cases, has the University of
Pittsburgh learned nothing
from Cincinnati? Why is cen-
sorship the only question at
Pitt when there are other
telling inquiries to be made?

Vice Chancellor Harmon and
the PPC Art Committee should
show “There’s No Place Like
Hollidaysburg.” The Pitt com-
munity deserves the free
expression, and David Brown
deserves the enlightened
thought.

Rosenblum, a graduate stu-
dent in art history at Pitt and
a freelance writer.

Brozvn case has been settled by

Orange nearly sour Panthers‘ season, 5 5-50

By Jim Lakely
Managing Editor

NEW YORK —— The Blizzard of "95 wasn't the only
thing that caught the Pitt Panthers by surprise this
weekend. Despite a 55-50 loss to Syracuse in the first
round of the Big East Tournament, an invitation to
March Madness dropped in the lap of the 17-10
Panthers.

Pitt, thanks in large part to its wins over UCLA and
Illinois, has earned the ninth seed in the Southeast
bracket in the NCAA Tournament and will battle the
25-6 Utah Utes in Nashville Friday night.

And for the players, knowing that you will be play-
ing on the center stage of the basketball world makes
the annoyance of being stranded in frozen New York
City just melt away.

“I was ecstatic,” senior forward Brian Brush said. “I
wasn’t really sure if we were going to make it or not.”

Brush’s doubts are based on the way the Panthers

‘have struggled over the last two months. Since the
team’s victory at Miami on Jan. 25, Pitt has won all
but four of its last 12 games.

Slump or not, the Panthers are in. Which is more
than can be said for Providence — a team that shared
that precarious position on the bubble with Pitt this
weekend. When that bubble burst, Providence,
despite winning seven of 10 games to end the season,
was left out.

“There is always going to be controversy when you
have two teams on the bubble from the same confer-
ence,” Pitt swingman Orlando Antigua said. “I think
that our out-of-conference schedule is what pushed
us over the hump compared to Providence’s record.

“I do know that Providence did deserve to get in,

Sports Assistant

NEW’ YORK — For the last six weeks,
the Pitt Panthers have done everything
in their power to play themselves out
of the NCAA Tournament field.

None of it worked.

The Panthers, once ranked 15th in

the nation, closed
with a horrid 4-8
stretch run. Friday
night could have
been the final nail in
Pitt’s coffin, the
proverbial bubble-
buster. In yet one
more brutal display
of Big East basketball — 1993 style -
the Panthers dropped a 55-50 decision
to Syracuse in the Big East
Tournaments quarterfinal round.

At 17-10, the Panthers appeared to
be on the outside looking in. But when
the NCAA selection committee
revealed its final verdict early Sunday
evening, Pitt was among the 64 teams
— headed for Nashville as the ninth
seed in the Southeast Regional. That
good fortune befell Paul Evans and his
squad after Friday night’s Garden
Party turned into an exhibition of
atrocities.

Playing under the hot lights and high
glitz of Madison Square Garden, Pitt
plodded through 40 minutes of basket-
ball as if it had no intention of reaching
the Big Dance.

“Obviously, a poor shooting night
and an even poorer shooting night
from the foul line,” Evans said. “I don’t
know what else to tell you.”

Syracuse, a team that will miss the
NCAAs for the first time in 11 years due
to probation, came to the Big Apple
intent on proving its Big East superiori-
ty, rebuilding a tarnished reputation

and possibly nullifying the confer-
ences automatic NCAA bid.

Despite their lofty motives, the
Orangemen did not dazzle with their
normally entertaining style. Instead
they struggled to gut out a sloppy vic-
tory. A

"I thought we hung in there,"
Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim said.
“Both teams just couldn’t make any-
thing. lt was just one of those games.
probably the worst Lawrence lMotenl
has ever shot the ball for us. He just
got a lot of good shots, a lot of good
opportunities and nothing went down

. It was just a game nobody could
make any shots. That happens some-
times when you get two teams playing
a lot of zone. But even our free throw
defense was good tonight.”

The Panthers shot a miserable 54
percent from the floor (18 of 55) and a
pathetic 41 percent from the free-throw
line. Pitt converted just five of 15 free-
throw opportunities in the second half.

Syracuse shot worse, a frigid .555
clip from the floor. Even Moten, the
Orangemen’s smooth first—team all-con-
ference forward, hit only three of 11
field goals for eight points.

At crunch time it was Syracuse’s fiery
guard combination of Adrian Autry and
Mike Hopkins who finally said enough
is enough. Autry, the talented junior
floor general, was the catalyst all night,

‘hitting for 20 points to go along with

four assists, four rebounds and three
steals.

“I think tonight I just let the game
come to me,” Autry said. “I didn’t want
to rush anything or force anything. I
wanted to be offensive—minded and
take some shots. That was the main
difference tonight — just taking my
time, being patient."

Hopkins, the feisty competitor who

Pitt recieves ‘gift’
from hoop heaven

For a team that has built a dubious reputation
by annually letting things slip away late in the
season, the Pitt Panthers must be on their knees
in thanks for what appears to be a gift from bas-
ketball heaven. 

The NCAA Tournament selection committee
ignored Pitt's horrid 4-8 record down the stretch,
its ugly first-round Big East Tournament loss to a
team on NCAA probation and a more deserving
Big East team with legitimate credentials — all to
plunge the once 15th—ranked Panthers into the

’Nova knocks off women's hoops in tourney

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team ended
its 1992-’93 Big East season Saturday, March
6, with a 74-59 defeat at the hands of
Villanova in the Big East Tournament.

Villanova used 50 percent shooting and a

stifling defense to send
the Panthers to their
second consecutive
loss.

"On an ordinary
night I think we can
beat them,” Pitt head

coach Kirk Bruce said. “They played very
well, but we didn’t play up to our potential.”

The Wildcats took advantage of 15 steals
and 28 Pitt turnovers to hold the Panthers to
43.6 percent shooting from the floor.

“Villanova did a nice job defensively
against us,” Bruce said. “I credit their
defense for our lack of offense.”

The ‘Cats ran an eight-point lead early in
the first half to as many as 17 in the first and
23 in the second, sending the Panthers to
their 12th loss of the season.

Pitt (15-12), seeded No. 4 in the tourna-
ment, got only 10 points from forward
Jonna Huemrich, more than eight points
under her average. Huemrich, who was

restricted with four fouls during the game,
was five-for—12 from the field and con-
tributed only six boards.

"They did a nice defensive job on
Ijonnal,” Bruce said. “You would think that

_Ionna could get off more than 12 shots.”

The combination of Villanova’s Nikki
lienedix and Karen Connell, who scored 23
and 14 points respectively, proved too
much for the Panther defense. Benedix led
all scorers with 23 points on eight-of-12
shooting. She also hit seven-of—eight free
throws.

“Benedix got a couple [of basketsl on
some breakaways,” Bruce said. “Once again
it was their defense that created a lot of
shots for her.“

The ‘Cats (15-12) opened the game with
an 11-3 run, culminating on a pair of
Benedix free throws at 15:39 of the first. Pitt
clawed back to cut it to only five on a Jill
McElhinny six—footer, but Villanova opened
it back up to 13 and eventually 17, the
team’s biggest lead of the half, at 3:26 on a
Karen Connell layup.

The half ended with Benedix hitting two
foul shots and increasing the lead to 37-23.

Huemrich hit only two baskets and no
free throws in the first frame, netting only
four points. Center Turia Ransom and
McElhinny led the team with six each, but

guard Erin Maloy was held scoreless with
only one assist and two turnovers.

Benedix led ‘Nova with 10 points in the
half. She also snagged two rebounds and
three steals. Curran followed with six
points.

Villanova used the second half to clinch
its first—round victory. The team kept a con-
stant lead of at least 11 points for the
remainder of the contest to dash any hopes
of a Panther rally.

Both teams emptied their benches at the
end of the game, with everyone seeing at
least a minutes worth of action in the con-
ICSI.

Not making the NCAA Tournament, the
Panthers will look for a bid from the NIT
(National Invitation Tournament), the sec-
ond of the two postseason tournaments.

The NIT, which is held in Amarillo, Texas,
will wait for the end of conference tourna-
ments to decide who to invite.

For some teams.the acceptance of an NIT
bid is just extending the season for no real
reason. But this team is different.

“The locker room after the game up at
ltoumament cite] Providence was one of the
most emotional locker rooms I’ve ever been
in in my life,” Bruce said.

“They didn’t want it to end and they didn’t
want to lose the friendships on this team.”

::y”1t:yE2:;1t£uncher

Before the shiny new
Pitt football coaching staff
had a chance to gather
any rust, a piece broke off.

Linebacker coach Brian
Williams, one of the few
members remaining from
former head coach Paul
Hackett’s staff, left to take
the same job with Fresno
State.

john Majors’ choice for
a replacement comes with
a football family back-
ground, 15 years of expe-
rience as an assistant
coach and a little rust.

Majors appointed 40-
year-old John “Rusty”
Russell as linebackers
coach last week. Russell
coached the linebackers at
Southern Methodist
University the last three
years. He has also been an
assistant with Central
Florida (defensive coordi-
nator in 1989), Valdosta
(Ga) State (1986-88),
Vanderbilt (1984-85),
Memphis State (1981-83)
and Georgia (1978-80).
He was on Georgia’s staff
when the Bulldogs won
the national champi-
onship in 198().

“I am very pleased to
hire a coach who has such
an extensive coaching
background as Rusty
Russell,” Majors said. “He
comes from a strong foot-
ball family, and he has
established his own repu-
tation in a positive manner

The family background
is in the form of Russell’s
father, Erik Russell, a for-
mer defensive coordinator

championships.

Rusty Russell was a sec-
ond team all-conference

Bittersweet

Pittﬁnisbesfomrb in E WI, sends six to nationals

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

Rande Stottlemyer said it
before the Eastern
Wrestling League finals.

“We could finish first or
fourth [at the Eastern
Wrestling League champi-
onships], it’s that close.” ‘

And that’s exactly what
Pitt did. Having opportuni-
ties to make a run at the
team title, the Panthers
were upset in the EWL
finals and finished in
Stottlemyer’s least wanted
premonition — fourth.

Finishing behind
Bloomsburg, Lock Haven
and West Virginia, Pitt put
three wrestlers in the finals
but came up short on all
three attempts.

The Panthers, however,
did send six wrestlers on to
nationals, the most Pitt has
sent since 1989. Advancing
were John Ritchey at 126,
J.J. Fasnucht at 134, Steve
Budman at 150, Sean Gibbs
at 167, Jeff Kloiber at 190
and heavyweight Pat
Wiltanger.

“We had six qualifiers [for
nationals], which is excel-
lent,” Panther assistant
coach Jim Beichner said.

Qualifying six out of 10
wrestlers is a feat for a Pitt
team that came off of two
disappointing season—end-
ing losses. Still, the
Panthers could not avoid
the upset in EWLs.

Perhaps the most shock-
ing turn of events came at
167. Panther Sean Gibbs,
seeded No. 1, lost to West
Virginia’s Scott Haig in the
167—pound finals.

“Sean got pinned early [in
the first period] which real-
ly hurt us,” Beichner said.

Gibbs, who had beaten
Haig in a regular season
dual meet, got caught on
his back early and could
not recover.

Pitt’s other co—captain,
Steve Budman, also ran into
trouble, losing in the finals
of his weight class.

While Pitt's seniors strug-
gled, the youths gave some

good signs of a bright.

future, especially first—year
wrestler Wiltanger.

“Pat [Wiltanger] was a big
surprise,” Beichner said.
“Wilt beat the No. 1 seed
[Cleveland State’s Jeff
Sherman] in the semi-
finals.”

Wiltanger was a surprise
because he was seeded

fourth entering the tourna-
ment. But Stottlemyer and
Beichner both said they
knew Wiltanger had the
skills to do well.

“Don’t count out Wilt, he
could finish first or fourth,”
Stottlemyer said before the
tournament. Wiltanger fin-
ished second and qualified
for the NCAA Tournament
in his first attempt.

More youthful Panthers
hopped aboard the NCAA
train as sophomore’s John
Ritchey (at 126) and J.J.
Fasnucht (at 134) placed in
the top three of their
weight classes and will
make the trip to Iowa City.

Making the trip for the
third year in a row is
Panther junior Jeff Kloiber.
The 190—pounder is back in
the NCAAs looking to
become an All—American for
the first time.

With six wrestlers making
the grade for Iowa City,
Beichner said he is excited
at what lies ahead.

“It’s a heck of a tourna-
ment [NCAAl,” Beichner
said. “Preparation is the key
—— this tournament becomes
much more individual. You
have to prepare yourself for
the tournament.”

. V y . . . u . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Beichner said the six
qualifying wrestlers are still
practicing with a few
wrestling partners and
coaches and that these
workouts produce an
atmosphere of individuali-
ty.

“We do what is best for
the wrestlers,” Beichner
said. “We give them time to
themselves, and we give
them time to heal.”

Having no EWL champi-
ons this year has not put a
damper on the Panthers’
hopes for an All-American.

“I think we have a good
chance to get at least one
[All-Americanl,” Beichner
said. “Gibbs is our best
chance. Wilt has a good
chance, too, if he goes in
with his head screwed on
right.”

Not ruling out anybody,
Beichner pointed out sever-
al circumstances that might
allow Pitt to advance far-
ther than expected.

“If you have a good draw
and a good day, anything
can happen,” Beichner
said. “But you still have to
wrestle hard and smart.
You got to go out and
know you did the best you
could.”

Pitt places
37 athletes
on Big East
Academic
All-Star Team

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
placed 37 student athletes on
the 1992-93‘ Big East
Academic All-Star Team,
which was announced last
week.

Jerry McCullough, Brock
Generalovich and Brian
Brush, each from the men’s
basketball team, highlighted a
squad that required a 3.0
grade point average for
sophomores, juniors and
seniors. First-year students
were not eligible.

Other selections included
Matt Brady and Don Boyd
from the swimming/diving
team, Bryan Henne, Al Lardo
and Michael Vincent of base-
ball, Carolyn Miller from the
women’s basketball and'for-
mer No. 1 seed Eric Weaver of
the men’s tennis team.

The track and field team led
all sports with nine selections.
The swimming/diving team.
was second with six members,
followed by cross country
with five. No football players
were named.

Syracuse

Continued from page 7
personifies heart and desire
who had burned Pitt for 20
points in a 78-74 Orange vic-
tory just six days earlier, was
silent offensively until the
game was on the line. After
missing his first six field goals,
four of them from three-point
range, Hopkins stepped up to
drill his only field goal of the

game just when Syracuse‘

needed him most.

With 3:17 remaining and the‘
score knotted at 43-43,
Hopkins drained a big three-
pointer from the left wing to
give the Orange a 46-43 lead.

“I just spotted up, and
Conrad lMcRael set a nice pick
 Adrian passed to me in the
corner and I just stepped up
like I did and this one just
happened to fall, the other
ones didn’t,” Hopkins
explained.

Eric Mobley’s tip-in brought
the Panthers to Within a point
at 46-45. After a Syracuse
timeout, Autry shook loose to
bury a three-pointer from the
right corner to stretch the

Orange lead to 49-45 with just
a minute to play.

"It was just one of those
games — the last two plays,
we just wanted to get Mike the
first shot and then Adrian the
second one, and they both
knocked them down and that
was the ball game,” Boeheim
said.

A free throw by Jerry
McCullough cut Pitt’s deficit to
49-46, but the steely Autry
was money, nailing both ends
of a one-and-one opportunity
to stretch Syracuse’s lead to
51-46, an overwhelming bulge
in this contest.

With the score 51-47
Hopkins stepped up once
more, coming up with one of
his three steals to seal Pitt’s
fate. John \X/'allace’s two free
throws made it 55-47. Brock
Generalovich gave the
Panthers slim hope with a trey
from the left corner, narrow-
ing the margin to 55-50, but
with just 10 seconds to go Pitt
was forced to foul and Autry
again nailed both free throws.

less from the outset in this
one. Syracuse led 25-17 after a
first half that saw Pitt ring up
more turnovers (11) than field
goals (six). Both clubs picked
up the pace slightly early in
the second stanza, when
Generalovich drilled a right
wing three-pointer to bring
the Panthers within 27-24. But
Autry responded, nailing a
sweet pull-up jumper and a
driving layup for a 31-24
Orange cushion.

Syracuse appeared ready to
slam the door, up 38-51 with
11 minutes remaining, but Pitt
clawed its way back into the
contest with a 10-2 run and
actually took a brief lead, 41-
40, on a 25-foot bomb by
Garrick Thomas. But just
when it appeared Pitt might
pull this one out, both defens-
es knuckled down and the
sputtering Panthers floun-
dered again.

Afterwards, Boeheim spoke
prophetically about the conse-
quences of the weekend.

All that controversy will be
left behind when the Panthers
head down to the campus of
Vanderbilt in Nashville. If Pitt
wants to prove to the hoops
world that it deserves to be in
the big show, it will have to
beat a tough and respected
Utah squad that has been
ranked in the top 25 all season.

There is little doubt that the
Utes will give Pitt a tough chal-
lenge, but the Panthers can
take comfort in knowing that
Utah is slumping too. Utah has
dropped three of its last four
games.

“Utah is pretty good and they

THE PITT NEWS, 'Tues’da‘y, Ma'rc”h'16;1993

Continued from page 7
wacky dope they were smoking
in Kansas City.

Wacky was indeed the opera-
tive word this weekend, as
upset after upset wreaked
havoc on the 64-team ﬁeld in
what was possibly the wildest
weekend since the inception of
the conference tournament for- ‘
mat. And with each surprise, it
appeared Pitt’s opportunity had
vanished into the crisp, icy New
York City air.

While talk of a down season
for the Big East was rampant,
the suspicion remained that four
Big East clubs would receive
invitations. That was the only
possible rationale on Pitt’s
behalf, that Seton Hall, St.
John’s and Providence would
need one more conference
companion. The once-proud
conference annually puts in
four or five teams in the field of
64.

Yet even that logic seemed
far—fetched as Pitt drifted listless-

ly through a brutal effort in
Friday’s loss to Syracuse. Simply
put, the Panthers bore no
resemblance to an NCAA caliber
team.

But as James Brown sat
amidst pictures of past NCAA
heroes — Derrick Coleman,
Larry Bird, Magic Johnson —
Pitt’s No. 9 seed prefaced a list
of forgotten teams —- UNLV,
Providence, Minnesota,
Oklahoma and St. Joseph’s to
name the foremost victims.

In interviews following the
announcement, Butters danced
around tough questions, slip-
ping candy-coated answers to a
shocked Dick Vitale while
attempting to justify the lunacy
of several inadequate selections.

Even an in-state analyst, Jody
McDonald of WIP radio in
Philadelphia exposed the
Panther selection, especially the
overlook of Providence, for
what it was: a miscarriage of
basketball justice.

How, he argued, can the

committee overlook a surging
Providence team that not only
looked inspired in winning
seven of its final 10 games,
thrashing Connecticut and bat—
tling Seton Hall to the wire in
the Big East tourney, but also
defeated the Panthers? How
could the committee choose a
Pitt team that scored only 50
points against Syracuse — 17 in
the first half.

For all of the negatives, even
the positives were hardly
impressive. The Panthers made
this tournament largely on the
basis of two games, a December
home win over UCLA and a
road victory at Illinois.

Granted, the Illini’s Assembly
Hall is a difficult place to play.
Much like Fitzgerald Field
House, the stands are very close
to the court and the crowd is
always rowdy.

But Pitt’s win in Champaign is
not nearly as significant when
considering that the Illini have
experienced major problems in

 

the second half of the season.
After dropping four of its final
five games, Illinois also found
itself in the list of bubble teams
as tournament selection pre-
views were released.

UCLA is overrated, plain and
simple. Forget the rankings. The
Bruins were mediocre before
Pitt beat them and haven’t beat-
en any opponent of substance
all year.

Pitt’s selection will put at ease
some of the harsh criticisms of
head coach Paul Evans. It will
give local columnists another
week to ramble about basket-
ball issues over their heads. It
will give the Panthers one more
chance to prove that their 13-2
record was not a fluke.

It will also deprive a much
more deserving team an oppor-
tunity to play in the NCAA
Tournament.
