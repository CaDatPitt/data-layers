A, plan for University-wide
student surveys of teaching effec-
tiveness is included in a report
submitted to Provost Rhoten Smith
by the Committee on the Evaluation
of Teaching.

Under the plan, the present
Center for the Evaluation of

. Teaching in the College of Arts and

Sciences (CAS) would be elevated to
the Provost level.

The Evaluation office would
conduct student surveys of teaching
quality, advise the,University on

' methods of teacher evaluation and
research teaching effectiveness,
according to the Committee’s
report.

A permanent director would be
appointed by the Provost with an
advisory board of faculty and
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents to staff the Evaluation office.

At" least one student survey per
year would be included in the
teaching evaluation of each Univer-
sity professor, except where the
survey cannot be used to accurately
rate the course, according to the
report.

The ﬁnal results of the evaluation
would be given to the Provost’s
office, according to the committee’s
report. Final results of the
supplementary student surveys
would be given to the Student
Government Board (SGB) for
publication.

The Evaluation ofﬁce would make
up the survey, which would be
administered and coded by the
University.

The projected student course
surveys would be similar to those
presentlyusedbytheCASCenterfor
the Evaluation of Teaching, accord-
ing to the report.

Students would be asked to rate
lectures, discssions, exams and
course difﬁculty.

Campus police voted 52-3 Friday
to strike, before a new negotiation
session was set for this Wednes-
day. according to State Mediator
Tom Quinn.

Before Quinn notiﬁed Pitt Labor
Relations Manager Tom Cherry
and John Bawnler, president of the
Amalgamated Plant Guards Union
Local 502 which represents most of
the officers, of the new talk date,
Cherry said, “We are prepared to
negotiate and realize negotiating is
a give and take procedure.” ,

Campus Police ofﬁcers have
agreed not to walk off their jobs
while contract negotiations conti-
nue.

Last week union representatives
had accused Cherry of walking out
of contract negotiations.

This weekend only seven of
nearly 100 Campus Policemen have

Professor Warns

not joined the Plant Guards union,
according to Chief Steward John
Forgie. More than 20 patrolmen,
disillusioned with negotiations,
joined the union just before
Friday’s vote was taken, Forgie
said.

Forgie said the police were
discouraged from the beginning
because the University failed to
notify them of contract talks until
August 0, although their contract
expired June 30.

Cherry said talks were delayed
from the. start because the

University was not ofﬁcially noti-

ﬁed by the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board until mid-July
about the police union changeover
trom leamsters Union. The officers
voted in June to switch from
Teamsters“ representation to the
Plant Guards union.

Milk Could Be Contaminated

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

At least one Pitt professor has
warned his students to avoid
drinking fresh milk for the next
month in the wake of warnings from
Dr. Ernest Sternglass of Pit_t’s
radiology department that the milk
may contain possibly harmful levels
of radioactivity.

Sternglass’ warnings stem from
concern that fallout from recent
nuclear tests on mainland China,

   
   

testing.

Radiology Professor Ernest Sternglass has issued a warning that

picked up radioactive particles . This
presents a particular threat to young
children, he said.

‘ ‘ Drinking fresh milk presents the
greatest hazard,” Sternglass said,”
and the danger will last for about
four weeksor so. The danger isn’t as
great for older people,” he added.

Sternglass claimed his basis for
concern rests on information from
earlier government studies on the
amount of radiation reaching the
United States from Chinese nuclear

low-level radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing on mainland China
may produce harmful effects in Pittsburgh.

which supposedly reched the United
States this weekend, will work its
way into the biological foodchain
which produces milk.

According to Sternglass, the
radiation concentrates in milk
because cows eat grass that has

“The chances of some of the
fallout reaching Pittsburgh are
excellent,” Sternglass said. “The
fallout itself travels around the
planet in about 14 days. . It’s
impossible to tell what the
concentration would be in any given

area because of weather patterns. ”

Sternglass has been a leading
participant in a controversy among
radiation specialists over the danger
of long-term exposure to low levels
of radiation. Many experts disagree
with him on the level of danger faced
by people exposed to radiation in
small increments. ’

The skepticism over the effects of
low-level radiation centered on a
mass of data collected from
experience with intense, high-level
radiation exposure, such as Hiro-
shima, Sternglass said.

He cited a recent article published
in Nature magazine of London, in

Pitt Student's
River Death
Still Mystery

BY BILL MOORE

Reports that Pitt freshman John
N. Behnk was murdered, rather than
a suicide victim, are premature; a
Pittsburgh police spokesman said
last night.

Police said the death of the
engineering student is still under
investigation by homicide detectives
and Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht.

Behnk, 18, was found ﬂoating in
the Monongahela River Thursday
with a piece _of construction
equipment fastened to his neck.

Behnk had been missing since
Saturday, Sept. 25, after leaving a
party at the Triangle fraternity
house, 268 N. Belletield, The
youth ’ s mother has said she believes
the death had nothing to do with the
fraternity party.

She said she believes her son
apparently was intercepted on his
way to the family car, which was
parked on Lytton Avenue in north
Oakland.

Members of the Triangle frater-
nity said last night they would not
comment on the death until a house
meeting was held tonight to discuss
the incident. They refused to say
whether Behnk had plans to pledge
the fraternity.

Police reportedly have been
questioning students in Behnk’s
classesto see if he had complained of

personal problems. Mrs. Behnk said ,

her son was not troubled and had no
reason to commit suicide.
According to the Coroner’s office,

toxicology tests are being taken, but i
' drowning is currently believed to be
- the cause of death.

Behnk lived with his family in
Allison Park and commutedto school
with a neighbor.

Voter Registration Tally

Indicates Student Apathy

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

“Pitt voter registration this year
reﬂects student apathy surround-
ing the presidential election,”
according to Marnie Abraham,
president of the College of Young
Republicans (CYR).

During a two-day drive last
week, over 1,200 students register-
ed to vote at sites on campus
including the Towers Lobby,
Student Union ‘Art Gallery and the
Cathedral.

College of Young Democrats
(CYD) President Linda Schwartz
agreed this year’s registration
indicates a lack of student interest
in the upcoming election. The ﬁrst
day total registration of 500
students was much lower than the
1972 ﬁrst day total of nearly 2,000,
she said. p

Mark Satinoff, president of the
Young Socialipsit/,..A»*”” _-.

 

(YSA),

believes “people are frustrated and
turned off by the politicians of
today.”

Abraham and Schwartz said the
CYD and the CYR are trying to
increase voter awareness and
generate student interest in politics
on campus.

Satinoff said the YSA will not be
inhibited by the “undemocratic”
ruling prohibiting canvassing on
campus.

“If we recieve any ﬂak from the
University, we and the American
Civil Liberties Union will challenge
the administration,” Satinoff said.

All three student groups plan to
distribute literature in the Student
Union and sponsor campaign
speakers.

for promotion or tenure.

An evaluation by teuow Iaculty

materials, student evaluations and
other materials, which may be added
at the discretion of the candidate,
would be included in the dossier,

according to the Committtee’s

which a study conducted in India
indicated radiation of a low-level
nature can have detrimental effects
on infant development and can
increase infant mortality rates.

Sternglass added that 111 “hot
spots” where concentration levels
might reach the amounts recorded
previously following a Chinese
nuclear test, there could be as much
as a 10% increase in the normal
amount of infant deaths.

He added tests in Canada has
indicated low-level radiation has
certain chemical effects on the
biological functions of the cell which
are “far more serious than anything
we had expected before.”

Next Step, Compromise

The University senior staff’ s rejection of Student Government Board
(SGB) President Barry Weisband’.s proposal to let a student
representative sit onthe Chancellor’ s budgetary staff is probably the ﬁrst
clash in the yearly tuition hike ﬁght.

Every year the student body has justiﬁably sought representation in
Pitt’ sbudgetary planning, trying to get a glimpse at the sacred Ievel One
Budget, to seek the real source of Pitt’ s increased needs. Each year they
have been turned down.

Last year some progress was made when Vice Chancellor of Planning

and Budget Jack Freeman briefed members of SGB on the reasons behind

the tuition hike. But it is time for further steps to be taken.

Any criticism of the senior staﬁ will have to wait until it is discovered
why they rejected the proposal. It is better to wait until a statement is
offeredby Freemanor Chancellor Posvar,toseeiftheyinitiatethe needed

- move toward compromise.

Pitt is a middle-class school. The hard-eamed dollars studentspay
tuition with contribute alarge enough portion of Pitt’ s revenues to merit

The senior staff’ s proposal recommending student representation on
individual budget committees is a start. But who will tell the deans of
individual schools to recognize these student representatives? Certainly
not SGB. This is something that the Chancellor must do. ‘

Weisband claims that student representation on the Chancellor’s
budgetary staﬁ must comethisyearorit might neverhappen at all. But he
must realize that in an all-or-nothing contest, the chance of winning all is
equal to the risk of getting nothing. _

It is true that the administration might get smug with a concession like
the senior staﬁ’ s offer. But all parties, including Weisband, must keep
themselves openfor compromise and, perhaps, not obtain their ﬁnal goal
in one year. -

Inthelongrimitwillbe upto Weisband, Freeman and the Chancellor to
prove to each other what level of student input is desirable and necessary.

Russians Are Welcome

The Good ol’ Days Are Back

BY TOM WASELESKI

Well, the Puritans have landed
again. .

And it’s about time because
things were getting out of hand
there for a while, what with Jimmy

Carter making remarks to, to that .

magazine about “lust” in his heart
for other women.

It’s nice to see a lot of latter-day
Victorians in the press, too, ready
to pounce on instruments of the
Devil like Carter.

I guess we should’ve known right
then and there when the hemlines
dropped that we were headed for
more righteous times.

IMPRESSIONS '

Chancellor Wesley Posvar’ s proposed exchange program between Pitt
and Moscow and Leningrad state universities is a good idea that should

have been implemented long ago.

Planning, which commenced at the suggestion of the U.S. State
Department, callsforthe exchange of facultyor graduate students as soon

as September 1977.

Not only would this be a boost to Pitt’ s prestige, the human storehouse
of knowledge contained on this campus would increase considerably.

The Russians have made great strides in many areas of human
knowledge. And what better way for our educators to tap this resource
than to talk to their scholars or perhaps a colleague of their scholars,
rather than read translated results in a journal of a particular ﬁeld.

Implementation of this program would further Pitt’s status as a world

university.

This second Plymouth landing"
couldn’t have come a year too soon
either with the race for President so
tight. Just why it's so tight I
wouldn't know. I’d think it’d be
split clean open by now, with Ford
on the one side with a son in
divinity school (we won’t talk about
the rest of the Fords) and that wolf
in sheep’s clothing, Jimmy Carter,
who teaches Sunday school then
goes blowing off his erotic fantasies
to Playboy. .

Ban Stiffles Political Expression

BY DAN MUl.HOLLAND

last week, it was discovered that
distributing political leaﬂets and
other campaigning would not be
permitted to take place on campus
in connection with the upcoming
national elections. The reason
given in support of this action was
that such activity might be
mistaken by some as an endorse-

‘ ment by the University of a

particular candidate or party,
which may be inconsistent with the
school's status as a state related
institution. Needless to say, this
policy has drawn considerable
criticism from a number of
individuals and groups, including
the American Civil Liberties Union.
For once, this writer is inclined to
agree with them.

The obvious effect of the ruling
will be to stiﬂe the exchange of
political ideas at a time when such
discussion is vitally needed. Recent
surveys have shown that as many
as two thirds of the voting public
plan to stay away from the polls in
November, due to a lack of interest
in the candidates and the issues.

This can largely be attributed to
a lack of information, which the
University policy will only make

worse. By depriving the University ‘

community of a signiﬁcant source
of information, the policy insures
that voter apathy will continue. If
the only thing the University fears
is that they will be accused of
partisan politics, such accusations
could be prevented by a simple
disclaimer in the Pitt News or the
University Times. The slight
inconvenience and cost in doing so
is by far preferable to curtailing
rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment.

Beyond the‘ apparent issues
however lies the real crux of the
problem: a basic hypocrisy
underlying the University’s treat-
ment of political matters. "While
legitimate political expression by"
responsible individuals is prohibi-
ted, radical groups of every stripe
are given free reign to pander their
wares and foist their incendiary
doctrines on society.

A classic case in point is the so
called “Save the People” book-
store on Forbes Avenue. Currently

.  V", ...,.

I.-~ .-...,m_\w

in the window is a display featuring
a large portrait of V the recently
departed Mao Tse-tung, who,
according to a report by the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee’ in
1971, is responsible for the murder
of as many as 64 million Chinese.
Beside the picture is a banner
calling for world wide revolution.
Inside the store one can purchase
virtually every kind of revolution-
ary pamphlet and tabloid imagin-
able, as well as books by such
luminaries as Karl Marx and
Joseph Stalin. The basic message
conveyed by most of these tomes is
the overthrow of the United States
by violent means—in other words,
treason.

While this in itself is bad‘
enough, it is rendered reprehen-
sible by the fact that they share the
building with the University
department of black, studies and
community education, whose title,
until very recently, was on the
same window as the revolutionary
display, which would lead any
passerby to believe that the

you?

Who buys all those copies
anyway? If Joe McCarthy was still
around, l’ll bet he’d know.

Nevertheless, Playboy’s going to
feel the sword of redemption, too,
in this wave of Goodness. They
must’ve really been doing the
Devil’s work (and doing it well)
when they tricked Vice President
Rockefeller, Treasury Secretary
Simon, Senator Charles Percy,
Mayor John Lindsay, Albert
Schweitzer, Martin Luther King Jr.

interviews for that skin sheet.

But it’ll be a cold day in Hell

especially pardon very well. He’s
vetoed numerous public service
bills and put the money where it
can be of most use, in the
taxpayer’s pocket.’

President Ford's a true states-
man, never wafﬂing from week, to
week, apologizing for this or that
like Jimmy Carter. Ford doesn't
apologize for anything.

He and the new Puritans will <2
take the country back 350 years to
where it belongs. No more Playboy
politicians, no more lust in human
hearts. Just a buckboard in every
garage and a stockade in every
town square.

   

fAstrology-A Question’

  of
Intellectual Corruption

The utilitarian benefits of science are so obvious that it is easy to forget
its role in freeing the human spirit from the burden of superstition. The
cheap titillation of of man’s unconscious hopes and fears in an uncertain
world is a perennial commodity for exploiting those who don’t know
better. lo ﬁnd, however, that the University—the Cathedral of Reason-—
provide sa sanctuary for pop counter culture may seem innocuous to some
people; to us it is an outward and visible sign of intellectual corruption.

Clearly, there is a large enough potential market for the occult at Pitt to
warrant printing advertisements for a course on ‘ ‘The Darker Side of the
Supern atura ’ ’ presented for a fee of $15 in Pitt’ s Informal Program of Non
Credit Courses for Adults and for two Astrology Courses (Intro to
Personal Horoscope and Intermediate Horoscope) at $10 a shot, which are
offered by the Ofﬁce of Student Activities . An area of the Pitt Bookstore is
dedicated to the display and sale of occult materials.

It has become a common practice in the past few years to take English
departments to task_for the fact that ‘ ‘Johnny can’t read, ’ ’ write, spell or
express himself in complete, coherent sentences. By all rights then, we in
the science departments at Pitt and the high schools which feed them
should feel distress at clear and present evidence that Johnny and Janie
may also be gullible and anti-intellectual in just those areas where our
materialistic culture often takes its greatest pride——science and
rationality.

statement: "There is virtually no
authority other than the press
capable of checking that‘ power (of
Congress) by bringing to light the
many ‘errors ofjudgement' regular-
lyoccuring on CapitolHill." Thisis a
very interesting statement, and one
which I'm sure will shock many
students of American government.
1, for one, have been led to believe
that the systems of checks and
balances included only the legisla-
tive, judicial and executive branch-
es, and not a privately owned
enterprise such as CBS News.

Next, since theauthor chose to
bring up the case offormer President
Nixon, it's interesting to note that
one ofthe three Articles of Impeach-
ment that he would have had to face
was contempt of Congress. Are we
to understand, then, that a private
individual should have more
authority with regard to Congress
than the President of the United
States?

In the article, the author states:
“In calling Schorr to testify and
threatening him (with fine/impri-
sonment) the Ethics Committee is
obviously attempting to exercise
control over press coverage of

Congress." There is nothing
"obvious"aboutit. What the Ethics
Committee is attempting to do is
prevent the leakage of classified
material. It is again important to
note that no sanctions are being
imposed upon Schorr for releasing
"the report, and that it has been
proven that the government cannot
prevent the press from disclosing
"secret" material once they have
obtained it. This was shown in the
case of the Pentagon Papers. And,
finally. there is nothing explicit, or
implicity in the First Amendment
that supports the belief that a
newsman has the right to protect his
sources.

A was as concerned as it professes to

be in protecting its public image as
a “non partisan” institution, steps
would have been taken long ago to
disassociate itself from such radical
enterprises like the bookstore.

Unfortunately, there are many
other instances of the University
lending its support to fringe
political activities. The sponsoring

they cannot deny that the current

BY SUSAN SKLAR

Pitt's Counseling and Placement
Center offers a variety of services
free of charge to all Pitt students and
faculty members.

Through its four separate
branches, the Psychological Ser-
vice, the Learning Skills Center, the
Career Development Program and
the Placement Service, the student
can receive assistance in either
personal or academic areas from his
first to his last year at Pitt.

Recently, however, individual
counseling offered by the Psycolo gi-
cal Service branch of the center has
not been utilized much by the
University community who may not
be aware that it’s services exist,
accordingto Dr. Penny Crary, one of
the five full-time psychologists
employed by the Center.

“We’d like to be busier than we
are," Crary said, “We at the
Counseling Center do not deal with
‘sick’ people. Here we deal with
healty people who are having
emotional problems.”

Some of these emotional prob-
lems, according to Crary, may
involve interpersonal relationships

“It is a normal occurrence for
people to encounter loneliness and

Cicero’s Serves ‘Real’Food

BY PETE BUT CH

Nothing lacks class more than
taking your date to McDonald’s
before going to a movie or sporting
event. But where else can you get
inexpensive food and not have to get
dressed up or go too far from

Oakland?
You can try Cicero’s Restaurant

on Forbes Avenue, near the corner of
Atwood Street. It is an honest to
goodness restaurant with no fast
food and waitresses who actually
come to your table and ask you what
you want to eat, instead of you going
up to the counter and telling them.

The atmosphere is of an
ltalo-American motif. And you
needn’t dress in your Sunday Best to
be allowed in.

The service there was very
courteous and efficient. Iordered a
plate of spaghetti in meat sauce with
meatballs. What arrived was about _a
six-' to eight-ounce portion with two

_ meatballs, each the size of a golf ball.

counselor, he can opt to see another.
The two female and three male
full-time psychologists employed by
the center are well-trained and fully
qualiﬁed, according to Crary. “The
center is not a training facility for
graduate students,” she said.

Of the three places on campus
where students can go for
counseling the University Counsel-
ing and Placement Service is the
most informal. No records are kept
and counseling is done on more of a
short-term basis than at either the
Student Health Service or Psychia-
tric Clinic.

One of the newest programs
offered by the center is the “Coming
Back” project. Designed by Crary, it
is described in the center’ s brochure
as “for the student who has been
away from a formal academic
environment for anumber of years. ’ ’
Crary describes it more informally.

It’s a place where people in a
group can give each other some
emotional support by sharing
problems like how to cope with an

environment where students are P
from age 18to 22. It’s an opportunity ‘

for discussing and sharing,” Crary
said..

The group is designed for the

student older than 18, for those
students ranging up to 45 or 50 years
of age. The returning student,
according to Crary, often has been
out of school for a good while and is
worried about things like taking
tests and using the library.

When the group starts, workshop
leaders will work with the students
on test taking, note taking, writing
research and term papers and using
the library.

For most people at Pitt, many of
these skills become second nature
after high school, but the returning
student often feels insecure about

things that he was once able to do, V

according to Crary.

So far, response to the program
has been extremely poor. Three
people have contacted the Center
expressing interest. If more people
don ’t respond to the idea of the once
a week, two-hour program, accord-
ing to Crary, the Center is thinking of
an all day “Coming Back” seminar.

“Either people haven’t been
seeing the ads and posters that the’
University has posted or else the
particular student that we’re aiming
for is so bogged down with either a
job or a family that he ﬁnds that he
doesn’thavetimeto do anything else
but go to class and study,” Crary
said. O .

Rizzo ii‘oP’s"HI's CORK

PHILADELPHIA (AP)——It was
the old Frank Rizzo, popping the
cork on a bottle of champagne,
bantering with reporters in his
office.

There was no trace of recrimina-
tion or hint that Rizzo had just
escaped the most serious of many
challenges to his control of
Philadelphia politics.

“My political career has suffered
no blow. 1, would have won bigger
than I did last time," Rizzo said in
an impromptu celebration reminis-
cent of an election night victory.

The State Supreme Court, by a 4-2
margin, killed an attempt to recall
Rizzo through a Nov. 2 general
election vote.

Opponents had accused him of
misleading people about the city’s
money problem and delaying a
decision to raise taxes until he won
re-election last spring.

National Park police said that
Pettine’s clothes had been torn off
his body, but they would not say
whether he had been sexually

Dances Black ‘Roots’

BY DENISE DAILEY

“Bottom of the Bucket, But.‘..
Dance Theatre,” a company
consisting almost soley of young
black dancers, performed over the
weekend at Stephen Foster Mem-
orial, staging the ﬁrst of seven
different dance concerts to be
sponsored by the Pittsburgh Dance

9 Council.

“The Bucket” describes itself as
celebrating the illustruious cultural
heritage of Africa, the West Indies,
Mississippi and Harlem, while
dealing with the vital and explosive
issues of today. A wide, range of
themes’ demands versatility from

Artistic Director Garth Fagan.

The opening piece, quite natur-
ally called Roots, expressed in-

‘ tensely the blacks’african tribal

heritage. When the curtain rose
for the first movement, the

.audience witnessed an eerie

“Invocation.” Fagan combines the
simple tribal dress of women and
authentic African drumming with
movement ritualistic in its repeti-
tive simplicity. A '

Seven women moved together as
a whole. The rhythm of their
bodies was one with the steady
drumming. The effect was
magnetic and hypnotic. Just as the
ceremony faded, the dim lighting
went bright--the drumming chang-
ed to a high-pitched frenzy and four
men with painted faces in
leopard-skin loincloths burst onto
the stage for the “Hunt.”

Their energy matched the high
intensity level of the music, and it
was amazing.

Throughout Roots, Fagan’s
choreography was well-suited to
the technical ability of his dancers.
Men- and women performed toge-
ther in the last section, “Fettish,”
and it was especially beautiful to
watch as the company obviously
enjoying the way in which they
were moving.

The most powerful artistic
statement was expressed in the
second piece entitled Liberation
Suite, a collection of five dances
dedicated to such black hereos as
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
and Angela Davis.

Each piece expressed different
facets of the Afro-American exper-
ience, ranging from repressed rage

_to human warmth, from bottomless

despair to limitless hope. The
Suite ended in a powerful image of
the bl_ack community standing
united and determined against the
solitary background of time ticking

away.
One movement called “Four
Women,” dedicated to Angela

Davis, was an excellent example of

how intricately modern dance and

theater are related. Although the
soloist was not technically perfect,
she dramatized superbly the anger
and sadness expressed in Nina
Simone’s song and in Fagan’s
choreography.

Salon--for fashionable five-toed
dragons had an extremely interest-
ing experimental ﬂavor. Fagan
created a surrealistic collage using
strange combinations of men and
women dressed in bathing suits
dancing with others in evening
clothes and grotesque platform
shoes, a scene reminiscent of
Susie’s Salon in .Fellini’s Juliet of
the Spirits.

— Especially effective was his use
of the space on stage, as the entire
cast ﬂowed about in intricate traffic
patterns.

' The next-to-the-last piece, en-
titled Grits Soufﬂe, demonstrated
Fagan’s ability to choreograph in a
more classical tradition. Although
the dancers did not ‘have the
technical expertise to be as
comfortable in this piece as in the
others, the movement had an airy
quality providing an excellent

. contrast to the last number for the

evening, Thank You Jesus.

a breather. He stopped mumbling.

Sam Hazo Kicks Off
Poetry Forum Series

BY TOBI ROSEN

In 11 years, his purpose has

gathers poets from all over the

for an evening’s reading.

The International Poetry Forum,
located atthe Carnegie Lecture Hall,

SAMUEL HAZO I

kicks off its season this Wednesday
night with Hazo on the pulpit.

‘ ‘Wetry to expand the meaning or
poetry,” Hazo said. “Poetry is
meant to be heard, not read as
verse.”

must attune itself to careful
listening—an underdeveloped art in
American culture.

Hazo explainedthat while the poet
may be interesting, readers may
vary in quality, therefore, affecting
the experience.

He draws a parallel between
music and poetry concluding that
each must be sounded in order to
“come alive.”

Poetry will “come alive” at the
Carnegie Lecture Hall until April 13.
This season’s lineup includes
actress Anne Jackson, Jose Fererr in
‘ ‘ Shakespeare Without Tears, ’ ’
three British poets, two French-
Canadian poets and a spring reading
“American Blues and

salad-—-each artist contributes to the
color and taste,” Hazo said.
While speciﬁc poet choices hinge
upon availability, Hazo’s criteria
rests on quality. A “Big name”
Poet’s drawing power is never taken

. into serious consideration when

planning the season’s bill.

“Take someone like Rod McKu-
He’s not a poet; he's a self-
publicist,” Hazo said. “His work is
saccharin, not poetry.’ ’

“Starz' & ‘Runaways’

Worn Out KISS and Punk Rock

/1-

9

BY JIM FARERI

Starz is brought to us by Rock
Steady productions, the same
machine that cranked out that thing
they call Kiss. I As if to make up for
this, the group's debut album,
Starz. (as the KISS first album was

called KISS) is produced by Jack.
Douglas, famous for his work with
' Aerosmith.

Well is any KISS members fall
from the ranks because their band
has grown boring, Starz will be
there to catch them on the rebound.

This band of five unknowns,
including a fat-lipped lead vocalist
in the Jagger-Tyler tradition and a
drummer who could pass for Louie
the 14th, walks in the footsteps of
KISS. , .

Their music sounds like warmed-
up KISS leftovers, heavy metal all
the way, ‘keyboards prohibited.
Mindless, pubescent lyrics ﬁll the
narrow gaps between searing
guitar notes produced with painful
accuracy. .

Starz biggest problem is neither
poor musicianship nor inept song
writing. It is simply a lack of
originality. The band is cast from
the KISS mold and is geared to that
very singular KISS audience. '

There are two cuts worth
hearing, “Detroit Girls” and
“She’s Just A Fallen Angel.
“Detroit Girls" exploits the best
rhythm on Starz without giving up
on it before the song is over, a bad

.=Starz habit. It is clearly the best

«band does.“ 3*
“She’s ‘Just ‘A Fallen Angel”

,indicated Starz potential if they.

could be free of Rock Steady. It is a

‘slow, natural, pleasing number

written and performed rocker the. -

 

Other tidbits including good
guitar_and vocals highlight the rest
of the rubble, but aren't worth
searching for. The opening guitar

of “Now It Can” is enough to

seduce the listener,‘ but a minute
passes and those great chords
prove_ a teaser.

_ And what about Jack Douglas?
Can’t brilliant producers save just
about anything? Not here they
can’t. Douglas only sharpens up
the old knives, he can’t be a
fountain of youth for worn-out
material. His biggest donation to
Starz is his name.

But Starz will get an audience.
_All of you aging adolescents who
just love KISS, but are too
embarrassed to buy their albums,
will fell comfortable with Starz.
These boys have yet to wear grease
paint or gargoyle costumes.

The Runaways is the spearhead

“Bottom of the Bucket, But...

  Two-Tone Booters Bow

To Too-Tough Temple, 8-0

BY JIM LEWIS

Will the real‘ Pitt soccer team

A please stand up?

The Panthers displayed two types
of gameplans Saturday—sloppy and
neat-—iﬁn' “a 8-9 loss at Temple in

\«

which, to En the truth, even Kitty"

Carlisle couldn’t pick out the real Pitt
Panthers.

First, there was the Pitt soccer
team Number One, the sloppy,
mistake-laden squad that handed
the Owls a 7-0 ﬁrst-half lead.

“They were too good for us to
make the mistakes that we did,”
Pitt coach Leo Bemis said. “They
were converting our mistakes into
goals very quickly.”

Yes, once nationally ranked
Temple caught ﬁre, there was no
cooling them off. And the sad part
was that Bemis could have slowed
the Owls’ momentum and collected
his troops if he called a time-out.

' RIFLETEAM THIRD

The Pitt Riﬂe team came within an
inch of upsetting the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Riﬂe
League's ﬁrst-ranked team, Indiana
University of Pennsylvania, ﬁnish-
ing third in a triangular exhibition
match Friday night at the latter’s
home range. ’’

West Virginia University, a
national powerhouse, placed first
with 1,346 points, followed by
Indiana with 1,294 and Pitt with
1.291.

Individual high scorers for the
Panthers included Mike Heck with
267, Steve Sisak with 260, Lenet
Klemencic with 259, Cindy Shaw
with 254 and Lloyd Sayman with 251 .

The team, currently 1-1 in league
play and 1-3 overall, will host
Carnegie-Mellon and Youngstown
State at home Friday.

Unfortunately, there is no such
animal in soccer.

“It’s not like basketball. There
are no time-outs, ” Bemis said sadly.
“If I could’ve called a time-out to
regroup our team, I would have. We
just couldn’t stem the tide till
halftime.”

But, mercifully, halftime came,
and from out of the locker room
emerged Pitt soccer team Number
Two, an aggressive, neat-as-a-pin
team which gave the stunned Owls
their money’s worth.

Although the Panthers didn't
score,
Temple, earning plenty of chances to
put the ball in the nest and giving up
only one cheap goal defensively.

“In the second half, we were
moving the ball,” Bemis claimed.
“Everyone was doing their job.”

Especially Fred Dohrmann, junior
center-forward for Pitt. After a knee
injury sidelined co-scoring leader
Mark Nigh (back Craig Connolly is
the other leader with two goals),
Dohrmann went in and ﬁlledthe hole
impressively.

“He did a fine job, especially in
the second half,” Bemis agreed.

Basically, it was a Jekyll-Hyde
afternoon for the Panthers——the
same type of match they played
against Carnegie-Mellon last Wed-
nesday. But Bemis liked what he
saw in the Hyde half.

“We’re gradually growing up,”
he said. “We had intestinal
fortitude in that second half. That's

1 the sign of maturity.”

If that’s the case, then Pitt (2-3-1)
should be ready for Gannon-
Wednesday night at 7 p.m. in Pitt
Stadium.

Hopefully they'll bring their Hyde
side.

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

DURHAM, N.C.—When the Pitt
Panthers lost starting quarterback
Robert Haygood with a knee injury
several weeks ago at Georgia Tech,
there were thoughts of panic over
whether replacement Matt Cava-
naugh was capable of running the
tricky veer offense.

Well, the Doubting Thomases
can believe now as Cavanaugh has
quelled the panic by setting two
school records and falling just shy
of a fourth in the undefeated (4-0)
Panthers’ 44-31 marathon victory
over Duke on Saturday.

In what was expected to be a
low-scoring affair, Cavanaugh cap-
italized on a Duke ﬂaw in covering
the option and passed for ﬁve
touchdowns, racking up 370 yards
total offense, both school records,
passing for 339 of those yards or six
short of another Pitt mark.

Cavanaugh’s ﬁve scoring aerials
broke the old mark of four tossed
by Ivan Toncic against U.C.L.A. in
1959 and equalled by John Hogan

; versus Penn State in'l972. The old

total offense mark was 331 yards,
set by Bob Bestwick in 1951 against
Michigan State. In" that same
game, Bestwick passed for 345
yards, a mark also nearly reached.

One of the reasons for Cava--

naugh’s big day was easily

diagnosed, about as easy as the ‘
. Blue Devils’ defensive alignment.

With Duke free safety Dan Brooks
leaving his secondary position in an
effort to stop the running attack of
Tony Dorsett, who still collected
129 yards in 31 carries, and his
partner, Elliott Walker, Cavanaugh
was able to pick apart the rest of
the defensive backﬁeld.

“They were using their safety
man on the option,”
tight end Jim Corbett, =who
grabbed six of Cavanaugh’s 14
completions for 165 yards and a
touchdown. “Instead of using him
on the passing plays, he was
coming in and trying to stop
Dorsett on the option.” 6

So when Cavanaugh hit ﬂanker
Willie Taylor for a 66-yard
‘touchdown pass, Pitt’s longest, of
the year, the Panthers were on
their way to a 554-yard total offense
performance before 37,200 awe-
struck fans.

“I think we have some other
weapons to go to when pebple try to
shut down our option play,”
commented head coach Johnny

3 Majors. “It was one of the greatest’

said Panther '

didn't have room to breath. You
don't know how relieved I was to
see those two quick scores before

Actually the Panthers version of

second quarter points to give Pitt a

30-7 halftime margin after the Blue ,

Cavanaugh’s bomb to Taylor tied
the score, but the momentum
swung all the way over to Pitt when
cornerback J. C. Wilson blocked a
Duke punt, early in‘ the second
frame, getting so much of the ball
that it ricocheted into the end zone
for a safety.

With 2:43 left in the half,
Cavanaugh again found Taylor
free, this time for ten yards and a
score. With Duke linebacker Andy

On the receiving end of two of Matt Cavanaugh’s scoring tosses on

Cavanaugh was still able to
maintain his balance and find
Taylor in the end zone. Taylor
went on to snare two more passes
for 102 yards on the afternoon.

Leading 16-7, Cavanaugh passed
27 yards to Corbett to cap Pitt's
next drive with 0:25 showing on the
clock. But before the half was over,
with reserve Blue Devil quarter-
back Dale Oostdyk committing the
error, Bob Jury picked off a pass
and the Panthers were in business
again at the Duke 37-yard line.-

On the very next snap, Cava-
naugh led split end Gordon Jones
(two catches for 61 yards) down the
left sideline for another six-pointer
and the barrage ended with Pitt on
top by 23 points. i

“We played a much better game
than last week," said Majors.
“We were more ready to play this

a few lapses in the third quarter,

however. They could have had a

college football scene, it is easy to

size lead or any amount of time on

Panthers Make Splash

BY STEVE SYBERT

Playing against three of the
nation’s top teams at the first
-;:annual Pitt Invitational Tourna-
.ment, the Panther water polo
squad has proven it is a team with
which to be reckoned.

After polishing off Cornell, the

. Ivy League's best, 12-5 on Friday,

with Luis Toro pacing the scoring
with six goals and Jorge Machicote
and Butch Silva contributing three
apiece, the Panthers marched on to
overthrow last season's number
one team in the East, Bucknell on
Saturday, before losing a “heart-
breaker" to Michigan later in the
afternoon.

Machicote poured in four goals
against Bucknell, which won the
Easterns last season and are a
national power, and Silva kept the
pace with three tallies in a 9-7
thriller. “That really made our
day," said an overjoyed coach
Miguel Rivera, himself a veteran of
10 years playing time with the

.\ ,, 3. .,~,_) .,_ at _. '.

Puerto Ricannational team and an
All-America at San Jose State.

But what really would have made
Pitt's day was a win over another
national power, Michigan, top-
ranked in the Midwest. With the
Wolverines getting off an unusu-
ally high number of shots (27), the
Panthers could not contain Michi-
gan and lost 12-11 on a goal in the
last 15 seconds.

“We usually allow an average of
12-15 attempts,” Rivera said.
Goalie Walt Young, who Rivera
said looked good except for the
Michigan game, did manage 15

saves, two less than the total .

against Cornell and Bucknell.

“They were really shooting at us
in that game,"_continued Rivera on
the -Michigan loss. “The defense
came down and that was our
problem."

Machicote scored six more goals,
to give him 13 for the tourney;
Toro, two goals; and Carlos
Santiago, Peque Rolan and Mike

_ Mere. one each.

The big problem for the
Panthers, though, was “getting
up” for Michigan after a tough
game with Bucknell. '

“We were psyched up for
Bucknell and they took a lot out of
us,” said Rivera. “It was really
hard to get up again for
Michigan.” .

But on the basis of Pitt's.

Panthers have been invited to play
at an invitational later in October in
Ann Arbor, Mich, against some of
the top teams in the country again,
this time including Michigan,
Southern Methodist, Loyola, Indi-
ana and Texas A & gM.

“We’re going to go to that,”
Rivera said enthusiastically. - “It's
going to be excellent. We want to
get another shot at Michigan."
Michigan, by the way was upended
12-8 by Bucknell, a team the

  Bowlers Set To Strike

BY JERRY VILLELLA

Every year from October to
March, the Pitt bowling team, one of
the more obscure squads on campus,
isoutpoundingthepinsatthe Strand
Lanes on Forbes Avenue, or other
establishments.

Opponents include Duquesne,
Robert Morris, Community College
of Beaver County, Washington &
Jefferson, St. Vincent College and
Point Park. One might assume Pitt’s
massive enrollment and‘ urban
setting would produce a team which
would outclass, or at least dominate,
the Southern 1 Division of the
Western Pennsylvania Intercolleg-
iate Bowling Congress, but it
"hasn't-yet.

Bowling is not avarsity sport here,
and hasn’t been ‘for several years,
having been dropped before the

» recent athletic prosperity. Today’s

team is run by the Resident Student
Association (RSA), as an offshoot of
their Sunday afternoon recreational
league.
In January of 1975, a previous
bowling. club, which had been
playing the schedule, was dissolved

V by Student Government, leaving the

RSA league the only organized
bowling group on campus. It

inherited the remaining five
matches, and ﬁelded a team
averaging between 140 and 160. Its
two victories in 15 games was a
noticeable improvement over the
club's previous year’s winless
record.

Nearly all the other schools have

. varsity programs, which include

coaches, uniforms and a generous
supply of funding. Having the

» schools, which averaged in the

160-180 range, pick up the tab for

most expenses undoubtedly encour-

aged a better class of bowling than
Pitt could muster at the time.

It wasn’t that the Pitt team didn’t ;
get any money; the RSA, which

partially funds the Sunday league,
came up with gas money and paid for
a few matches. Sophomore Geoff
Joseph, who is the captain of this
year’s hopeful squad, has estimated
the cost of full funding. '

“Twelve matches, three practice
games for each bowler every week,
shirts and gas money would come to
about $500-$600, at the most,”
Joseph said.

If the 1975-76 team had yielded
the same results as its predecessor, a

strong argument could be made.

That’s true. A powerhouse last

year, Pitt had a young team which

everyone questioned would do even

But those questions are being
answered. 1

“This is a very young team that

AndraPletz,CindyChambers and

The Pantherette rickshaw hopes

Matt Cavanaugh showed all the doubters, who thought he couldn’t run

two-pointer cut the lead to 44-23 at
the end of the third quarter.
Barney ﬁnished the day’s scor-
ing by taking a pitch around right
end for a touchdown. Still another
two-point conversion made the
ﬁnal score stand at 44-31, though
Carson Long missed on a 29-yard
ﬁeld goal attempt set up by a
34-yard pass from Cavanaugh to
Corbett in the ﬁnal minutes.
GRID NOTES: Excellent play-
action and several well-executed
fakes were the key to Cavanaugh’s
passing success...Dorsett topped
the 100-yard mark for the 12th
straight game...A steady drizzle
just before gametime dampened
the ﬁeld a bit, until the sun broke
through the clouds with two
minutes left in the third quarter.
“Duke had the best offensive
team and the best balanced team

- Wilson photo

we've faced this year,” Majors
said. “Our offensive line for the
first time this year really put things
together, both running and pass-
ing.”

Verbal cheers against Dorsett
are joining the signs as the Duke
cheerleaders chanted “Who's Tony
Dorsett?" and “N-O-T-H-I-N-G,
that’s what Dorsett means to
me"...4S members ofthe Pitt Band
paid their own way to support the
Panthers.

Friday was a rough day for Pitt.
First, a tire in the charter's front
landing gear blew on takeoff from»
Pittsburgh and the other on landing
at Greensboro, N.C. The players,
coaches and reporters then had to
board a bus for a 55-mile trip to
Durham, where the airport there
was being paved and not in service

until Saturday.

Arnie Weatherington and Jim
Cramer once again led the Pitt
defense with 16 tackles a piece...

16 for 314 yards.

BY KAREN KADILAK

With a good percentage of this
year’ s nationally ranked Pitt football
team considered to be professional
prospects, it’s especially interesting
to see how ex-Pitt Panthers of the
past are doing as pro players.

A large contingent of Pitt grid
alumni are doing exceptionally well
as either players or coaches. Mike
Ditka, who became the epitome of
the modern tight end during a
star-studded twelve-year career
with the Chicago Bears, Philadel-
phia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys,
is the tight end-specialteams coach
of the Cowboys.

Ditka has been largely respon-
sible the past several seasons for the
effectiveness of the defending
National Conference champs’ often
complex offensive system. .

If you recall, it was Ditka’s
Cowboys who brought the old
shotgun formation out of the moth
crystals to an eventual Super Bowl
date with the Pittsburgh Steelers
last season.

Fred Cox, an old teammate of
Ditka’s at Pitt during the early
1960s, is the leading active scorer in
the NFLtoday. Cox, a Monongahela
native, is the placekicker for the
Minnesota Vikings. '

Richie McCabe, an all-time
favorite of Panther fans in the
mid-50s, returns as the defensive
backﬁeld coach of the Buffalo Bills.
McCabe, who was drafted by his

it {X . . .. ..  .. ..
hometown Steelers in 1955 before
being sent to the Washington
Redskins in 1959, was a two-way
back for the Panthers.

McCabe also performed for the
Bills when they were a part of the old
American Football League, where
he established himself as an all-star
selection before a severe knee injury
in 1961 abruptly ended his career.
He began his coaching career at
Carnegie~Mellon University before
entering the professional ranks as
the Bills’ defensive backﬁeld coach
in ’66.

Before returning to the Bills this
season, McCabe also served as an
assistant coach with the Cleveland
Browns and the Oakland Raiders for
the past six seasons.

 

Marty Shottenheimer, in his
rookie season as linebacker coach for
t_he New York Giants, is a graduate of
Fort Cherry High School and was an
All-America linebacker for the
Panthers before being drafted by
Buffalo in 1965.

Shottenheimer played in two AFL
championship games with the Bills
in '65 and ’66 before retiring as an
active player in ’7O with the Denver
Broncos.

Speaking of linebackers, Green
Bay Packers’ head coach Bart Starr
sees great potential in rookie Tom

‘Perko, Green Bay’s third-round
draft selection in April, after he led
the Panthers to their Sun Bowl
victory in December. Starr speaks in
terms of “mean, determined,
competitive and aggressive” when
describing Perko.

Meanwhile, Miami Dolphins’
head coach Don Shula has high
expectations for ex-Pitt defensive
star Bryant Salter to be a fixture in
the perenially tough Miami defense
this season.

’ Salter, who saw previous action
with San Diego and Washington
following his graduation from Pitt in
’71, came to the Dolphins from the

Redskins in the controversial Jake"

Scott deal.

Gary Burley, Panther grid class of
'74, has displayed the same old
dominating style of defensive line
play, which characterized his
All-America sojourn at Pitt, for the
Cincinnati Bengals. Burley, who has
been 9 terror for the Bexigals at

defensive tackle, will make his lane
'76 appearance in Pittsburgh when
Cincinnati takes on the Steelers at
Three Rivers Stadium October 17.

On the bad news side, Atlanta
Falcons’ rookie wide receiver and
Pitt Panther of a year ago Karl
Farmer has been placed on the
injured reserved list by the Falcons
with a knee injury.

 

t ormer Pitt linebacker Tom Perko, a third-round pick by the Green Bay

Randy Cozens, who also was
placed on injured reserved, by the
Denver Broncos, was a star
defensive lineman for Pitt last year.

short years ago.

Joe Schmidt, Pitt Classof'53 and a
mainstay at middle linebacker for
Detroit before becoming the Lions’
head coach from 1966-72, is a

member of two sports halls of fame.

 
   

Packers in last April’s college draft, is thought very highly of by Coach
Bart Starr, who describes him as “mean, determined, competitive and

aggressive.’ ’
