University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
officers often overstep the authority of the
university president, according to a memo
sent to UPMC President Thomas Detre by
Pitt President Wesley Posvar.

In the 15'Plge conﬁdential memo, Posvar
outlined problems caused by UPMC
officials who acted without Posvar’s
approval. A “perception of mutual
sovereignty” between UPMC and the
university is wrong, Posvar wrote.

The memo obtained by T/ye Pitt News
appears to be a final draft and is dated April
19, 1991. Detre and Posvar are both out of
town and are unavailable for comment.

UPMC officers engaged in real—estate
acquisitions for individual hospitals against
the interests of the university, fosvar wrote.

“In one recent case a university officer
permitted bidding against the university
for a major property which -he knew we
have long sought and in doing so raised
the price considerably,” Posvar wrote.

Pitt’s'Third Century Capital
Campaign raised $251.2 million
over a four—year period, exceeding
the goal of $225 million set when
the project began in June 1987,
university relations and
development officials said
yesterday.

The capital fund-raising
campaign was originally planned
to last five years, but it ended in
June 1991 because of its success.
“We exceeded our goal after
closing a year early,” said Susan
McDyer, executive director of
resource development.

The $251.2 million includes
cash contributions and pledges
which will be paid over the next
few years.

"lhe money raised, which is
being used partly to establish
scholarships and to fund research,

Henderson said.

Posvar’s memo discussed other real-

“More generally we know that local real-

acquisition programs led by university
officers themselves — have been bid up

and hospitals. There are recurring reports

Because of these incidents, “Every

through me or my designated deputy.”
These new procedures should help
“avoid mindlessly excess expenditures.”
Posvar also criticized how UPMC officers
dealt with local and national government
officials.
Though Posvar gave explicit instructions

to the responsible UPMC officer to report
congressional contacts to Posvar’s office,

his instructions were “mostly forgotten or

\Pitt researchers have discovered that anorexia nervosa, a

may be linked to anorexia might provide a more effective way of

Pittsburgh residents have
mixed reactions to North Oakland
“cruising,” which would be
outlawed by an ordinance
proposed by ‘ City Council
member Gene Ricciardi
yesterday. S

“If there’s cruising at night, I’m
sleeping.’ They don’t bother me
 I don’t know why I signed the
petition,” ‘said Helen Schmidt, 21
Filmore Street resident.

Almost 200 North Oakland
residents signed a petition earlier
this month requesting council to
“hold apublic hearing requesting
signage stating ‘No Cruising Zone
— Midnight-5 a.m.’ as a solution

.and dozens of times.

to the public nuisance of late-
night cruising in our
neighborhood.” City Council will
hold the hearing today at 2 p.m.

Bernice Walsh, a South

Dithridge resident who signed the '

petition, said the noise “never lets
up  I've called the police dozens
It's a
nuisance. I don’t care if they're
gay. I’m not the least bit interested
in what they do I’m just
interested in the noise they make
at night.” _

“It doesn’t bother me. But my
neighbors all say they can’t stand
the noise,” said Mary Weinstein, a
South Dithridge resident who
signed the petition.

Ricciardi’s ordinance would

-make it illegal to pass traffic

checkpoints two times in a_one—

hour period or ﬁve times in ai-

three-hour period between
midnight and S a.m.

First-time offenders would be 1.

Marshall Goodwin, a Winthrop

circulate the petition with Sue

Hughes, said he has seen cruisers‘ '

“masturbating in their cars, having

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, July 17, 1991

 

By David T. Welch
Staff Writer

Black studies department
Chairperson Brenda Berrian, who
succeeded Dennis Brutus on July
1, wants to further strengthen the
program by attracting a wider
range of students.

At first black studies saw little
involvement outside the African-
American student body.

“Since I came on board, it was
very rare to have a non-black
student in your class. Now we
have 50-50 enrollment [of blacks
and non—blacksl.

"The general comments among
black and white students were
quite negative. You used to hear,
‘Who wants to take that black
stuff?’ Now you get, ‘I would like
to take a black studies course.
W/hat do you offer?” People had
an idea that it was a department
for black students. It is a
department for all, students,”
Berrian said.

“The term ‘black’ is evil or ugly
if you look it up in the dictionary.
But that attitude has changed, not
totally, but it has changed,"
Berrian said.

Berrian attributed this change
to the number of black studies
courses which fulfill College of
Arts and Sciences requirements.

, “More students are taking [black
studies] because of the interest.
You have a choice of over 500

courses [which fulfill CAS
requirements], but there is a large
number of students coming over
here.”

The media have helped the
black studies program, Berrian
said.

“Students will say, ‘I’m reading
more about Africa in the
newspaper, and I want to know
more about it.’ There is an

I increased interest also because of

South Africa. [Nelson] Mandela’s
release increased interest even
more,” Berrian said. _ S

Berrian sees the program’s
longevity as a sign of its success.

“A lot of these departments
came about in the 1960s. Many no
longer exist, but this one is still
here.”

Berrian would like to offer more
courses and start a black studies
graduate program. “We’re at the
talk stage so far. [The graduate
program] is a pet project of mine
I hope to see realized.”

The black studies department
deserves respect because of its
faculty, she said. Seven of its eight
members are tenured, and two
are full professors.

Berrian disagrees with the Black
Action.Society’s claim that “Pitt is
not a comfortable place for black
students.”

“I don’t agree with that," Berrian
said. I I

" It depends on the particular
student. There are many African-

Black studies cbozir ozimsfor diversity

American students who like it
here, just like there are many white
students who will say, ‘I hate il

Is there racism at Pitt? “Yes.
There is racism that the faculty
and students must face. It ‘is
everywhere throughout the

United States. It’s an ongoing

process in this country,” said
Berrian. .

Berrian earned her bachelor’s
and master's degrees in French
literature from the Hampton
Institute in Virginia.

She was awarded her Ph.D. in
North American studies from the
Universite de Paris III—~—La
Nouvelle Sorbonne in 1976.

Her teaching career began at
the Universite d’ Omar Bongo in
Liberville, Gabon in Central
Africa, where she taught for six
months.

She returned to the United
States later in 1976 when she
became an assistant professor at
the University of Pittsburgh,
teaching African-American,
French, English, African and
Caribbean literature.

Berrian became an associate
professor at Pitt in 1984 .

Her predecessor, Dennis
Brutus, left the position because
of the department's rotating-
chairmanship policy. He recently
returned to his South African
homeland after 26 years in exile
in the United States.

Mandatory retirement
may end for Pitt profs

By Doug Herman
For The Pitt News

Professor Jack Tierney recently brought $200,000 worth of
funding into Pitt’s chemical engineering department. He will be
forced to retire in less than three years.

Professor Julius Youngner has already been forced to retire.
He has, over the past year, made major contributions to the
development of a flu vaccine.

The University of Pittsburgh has had a mandatory retirement
policy for many years which forces all tenured professors to
retire at age 70.

The policy does not include research professors, who are
compensated through research grants.

In 1986, Congress passed the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, ended mandatory retirement for most jobs.

But a rider on that bill placed a seven—year extension allowing
mandatory retirement for certain workers such as fire fighters,
police officers and tenured professors.

Many in the educational community questioned whether
such policies were justified.

A recent National Research Council study will probably
dissuade Congress from continuing the mandatory retirement
policy for professors with tenure, said Chris Maitland, National
Education Association higher education coordinator. _

The current extension will simply “run out” for Pitt if no
legislation is passed before Jan. 1, 1993.

Many in the Pitt community oppose mandatory retirement.

Professor Nathan Hershey said,”IMandatory retirement] is not
a very sound idea,” claiming that it is “too arbitrary.”

Hershey said earlygretirement benefits and other incentives
are sufficient to entice a professor to retire.

john Kun, a technical assistant who worked under Youngner
for several months, said, “Sure, you might not be as strong as
you used to be, but your mind doesn’t go when you're over 70.
A lot of people like Professor Youngner still have valuable
contributions to make.”

Youngner said he has “no axes to grind with the university”
because he receives a sizable pension and he is able to maintain
his office, his graduate students and his research grants as a
distinguished service professor. Although Pitt does not pay him
a salary, Youngner sits on the provost’s faculty affirmative-
action committee and the biotechnology safety committee.

Youngner said a retirement policy should ideally be evaluated

on a broad base,” said Mark

Cromie, director of current funds.

Funds for the capital campaign
were raised mainly through
personal solicitation, which
involved “a one—on—one
opportunity for volunteers to look
straight in the eyes of a prospective
donor and make a case for the
University of Pittsburgh,” Cromie
said. “The likelihood ofgenerating
support isrfar greater ifthe ‘ask’ is
done personally.”

Donors to the capital campaign
include alumni, non—alumni,
foundations and corporations:
“people who have a fondness for
the institution and want their
money to go to specific areas,”
McDyer said. Pitt conducts its
general fund—raising mainly
through direct mailings and
telemarketing.

“The capital campaign is above
and beyond the annual giving,”
said Karen Gorscak, campaign
associate. Money for the capital
campaign is used “for extra
programs above and beyond the
general fund—raising, which goes
on all the time,” she said.

fiscal year 1990 to $38.8 million in
fiscal year 1991. These figures
include all funds from yearly
drives and all other cash gifts
given to the university.

Pitt plans to concentrate fund
raising in the future on smaller
campaigns targeted at specific
areas of the university.

“When President U. Dennis]
O’Connor gets here  we’re going
to present to him [plans forl
smaller capital campaigns,
focusing on undergraduate liberal
arts,” McDyer said.

The recent reports of outgoing
Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
$5.5 million retirement package
and other internal problems
within the university will not
damage fund—raising efforts in the
future, resource development
officials said.

“I don’t see that as a problem. I
think that most donors recognize
the institution  is larger than any
person or group of people,”
Cromie said. ‘‘In the midst of the
turmoil contributions have gone
up. And with [incoming President
J. Dennisl O’Connor’s arrival,
prospects for the future portend
very well  for fund raising.”

fund—raising. “He senses that in
order to accomplish goals given
the current fiscal climate, you need
resources. You can’t sneeze at
fund—raising — it’s an important
part of the equation today  As a
Pitt fund—raiser, I feel very
confident that an already positive
situation is going to become even
better.”

The university periodically
holds capital campaigns, which
are designed to “raise a large
amount of money over a defined
time frame. They’re well-defined
in terms of objectives and dollar
levels, as well as areas they’re
targeted at,” Cromie said.

Pitt spends 9 cents ofeach dollar
raised through fund raising on
direct—development costs,
MacDyer said. The national cost
study done by the National
Association of College and
Business Officers said the average
university spends 16 cents per
dollar on overhead costs.

Pitt’s leading fu nd—raiser, Bruce
Loessin, is leaving Pitt this fall for
a similar position at Case \X’estern
University, which offered him a
salary increase and a larger staff.
Loessin is currently vice president
for university relations and
development at Pitt.

quickly than physicians can. The center’s
staff can quickly determine adequate
dosage amounts, possible side effects and
alternative medications, he said.

“We are the invisible ingredient in the
doctor/ patient relationship. We do our job
without ever seeing the patient,” he said.

DIPC’s services are available free to the
hospitals within the Pitt medical complex.
Future plans call for contracts with
hospitals and medical practitioners on both
local and national levels, Vanscoy said.

A $90,000 grant from the Merck
Foundation is funding the center for three

on duty at the center during working hours
and an after—hours paging system that
provides 24-hour access to a drug-
information specialist.

According to Vanscoy, all staff members
are pharmacists with advanced degrees
who have completed specialized res-
idencies in drug information. Each staff
member. has between eight to 10 years of
educational and work experience in their
ﬁelds.

The information center is open to the
public, but Vanscoy said patients should
work with their doctors and pharmacists
rather than calling DIPC.

Poison Center.

General-information calls and mild
emergencies are referred to the
poison center, and the poison center
directs the more complicated questions

to DIPC.

DIPC is also responsﬂ)le for evaluating
new drugs being considered for use in
the medical center-

Vanscoy said the center studies the
advantages and disadvantages of the
drugs and make its recommendations to
the approving committee.

DIPC also intends to increase its role in
pharmacoepidemiologic research, which

Cruising
Continued from page 1
“People driving around and
around for their social and sexual
activities is  an infringement on
our right to peace and quiet,"
Goodwin said. “We're not making
this up.”
Laura Johnston, a member of
the gay activist group CRY OUT!/
ACT UP, said, “I think [the

ordinance is] a violation of the.

right to assemble. It’s about rich
people who live in condominiums
who want their streets safe from a
element’ in their
neighborhood.”

Goodwin, who said he used to
be a member of a private gay bar
called Travelers, said the gay
community should be

 ~ concentrating on more important

things-than cruising.

“Where’s the gay community
center they’ve been talking about
for years?  Instead of taking

‘ [young gay men] somewhere and

teaching them some responsibility

.. they're promoting the art of
one-night stands. I think there’s a
lot of battles out there we should
be fighting.”

He doesn’t have much contact
with the gay community now, he
said. “I’ve sort of been ostracized.
They call me a homophobe."

Goodwin said he rents to gay
men. “If I didn’t want gay people
in my neighborhood, I wouldn’t
rent to them.”

Bill Hileman, a member of CRY
OUT!/ACT UP, said, “There's no
doubt that there is some level of
noise, and some people are
inconsiderate.” 

But noise pollution laws exist,"
Hileman said. “Even ' though .
police and residents may feel the
laws are inadequate, they haven't
been enforced.”

Goodwin scoffed at enforcing
existing lawsrather than drafting
a new ordina_nce. “If existing laws
worked, we wouldn’t have to ask
for a public hearing, would we?”

“When nothing works, that’s
the time to enact laws,” Ricciardi
said.

Hileman said, “I feel driving
around because you want to meet
people is legitimate. It’s not illegal,
and it shouldn't be. If they want
the serenity of Green Acres, then
that’s where they should move."

 
   
  

From 2:30 a.m. to 4 am. last
Friday, The Pitt News observed
about one car per minute circling
a point on Filmore Street between
South Craig and Dithridge streets.
No radios were played loudly for
an hour-and—a—half-long period.
Garbage and bread trucks made
loud noises, and several police
cars circled the area.

“Because of publicity the noise
has probably toned down,”
Ricciardi said.

Ricciardi said his ordinance is
modeled after similar laws enacted
in Williamsport and Harrisburg.
The ordinance is “not directed
toward any segment of the Pitts-
burgh community,” Ricciardi said.

City Council member Dan
Cohen, who represents the

neighborhood, was unavailable ‘

for comment.

“Obviously I’m very concerned
with personal rights and liberties,
but with personal rights and
liberties come responsibilities,”
Ricciardi said. “The repetitive,
unnecessary driving _of motor
vehicles in a four-block area is a
general public nuisance and threat
to public safety." '

Police officers would be
stationed at traffic checkpoints to
stop cars violating the ordinance.
Deciding which cars were cruising

“would become subjective,”

Ricciardi said.

“I think the police would be
much better off chasing people
who beat lesbians and gay men,

and people who rape and beat.

women,"-Johnston said.

Gay activists have covered
telephone poles in the area with
signs reading, “You have a right,
to assemble and walk the streets
as long as you're not breaking any
laws or local ordinances  Pitt,
CMU, the Carnegie Museum, the
bars, the stores and shops on Craig
Street \ (owl! This is a non-
residential area.”

Anti-cruising signs on telephone
poles read in part, “I suppose
cruising in a non-residential area
would be more considerate.”

The area affected by the '

hormones were recorded after the drug was administered to
observe serotonin levels, Kaye said.

Anorexia is “the last major psychiatric disease which we've

t,iDz_'ﬂ'icultz'es with the UPMC

‘ It is not surprising that the University of Pittsburgh

‘ Medical Center believes itself to be above the powers of
at tile university. After all, UPMC President Thomas Detre is
paid more than Pitt President Wesley Posvar.

» In our society, superiority is often judged by cash ﬂow. _

Posvar rightly believes, however, that university rules

‘ ‘supercede the amount of a paycheck. _
 0 -A The Pitt News recently obtained a copy of a 15-page
, memo Posvar sent to Detre on April 19. The memo said

the UPMC should not continue to overstep the authority
of the Pitt president " '
’ Posvar also accused the UPMC of “uncoordinated

i initiatives in Washington and Harrisburg” which cost the

university considerable amounts of money.
Pitt has always governed the UPMC, but judging from

the UPMC’s recent actions, it doesn’t seem to think that
' is true. '

It is imperative thata re-evaluation of UPMC’s loyalties

‘ and place in the university be sought immediately.

 T 0 bid...or not to bid?

- ‘Problems between Pitt and the University of Pittsburgh

Medical Center have arisen because of a bidding war over

_ the Syria Mosque.

The university’s most recent version of what happened

 . with the Syria Mosque deal, as told by UPMC officials: Pitt

and National Development Corporation each placed bids

‘  A on the property, which were rejected because the owners

of the mosque sought $10 million up front
0 NDC asked UPMC if it would be interested in putting up
the $10 million. NDC would demolish the mosque if

I ‘ UPMC agreed to occupy offices NDC would build on the

"site. UPMC checked the ‘purchase with the university and
also offered Pitt the opportunity to buy a portion of the
property that includes the mosque building. UPMC agreed

to NDC’s terms, and the sale went through as discussed.

There are several holes in that story.
0 Chemistry Associate Professor Toby Chapman argued at

a University Senate Council meeting on May 6 that. UPMC '

has greater financial resources than Pitt, and may
continually outbid Pitt for properties, preventing them
from expanding in the future.

If the UPMC checked with Pitt before agreeing to
purchase the Syria Mosque, then why did Posvar respond
to Chapman's concern at the meeting with this statement:
“We were bidding, and the development corporation

. outbid us, and the principal participant was the hospital”?

Are we supposed to believe that Posvar knew nothing
about the UPMC’s bid? »

No, we’re not.
' It is insulting that the university has misrepresented the
mosque bidding war at a time when Pi-tt has pledged to
maintain a “new era of openness."

Women are not ‘pieces of meat’

‘ I write in response to the
abortion/ferninism articles in the
June 26 Pitt News.

I was disappointed in Ms.
Doherty’s view of abortion as a
feminist issue, rather than a
“sanctity of life,” “religious” or
“scientific/medical” issue.

Ms. Doherty’s opinions on
feminism have some basic
validity, but the abortion issue is
not the appropriate forum for a
feminism debate, ‘and
furthermore it does not make
sense to speak of abortion in
terms of feminism, asMs. Doherty
does. [...l It is illuminating ‘to
consider that when abortion is
used for purposes of sex
selection, fetuses are more often
aborted if female and kept if
male, than vice versa.

l...] In contrast to_this article, I
found the editorial on feminism
by Jenna Ferrara more
reasonable. A woman should be
able to walk down the street
without being whistled at as an
object. Let's be honest ourselves,
guys; a lot of the time — probably
too often —— a whistle is only an
expression of a male view of

female as “meat” ‘(no matter how -

much we deny it). Similarly, as
Ms. Ferrara asks: Why do women
wear miniskirts and heels down
Forbes Avenue in the winter?
Probably because of a society-
imposed standard that women
should dress in a way that is
pleasing to men. These things do
make sense — perhaps they are
overstated at times, but they have
some basic validity to them [...l

Whoa, Trigger!

It’s time to say whoa! Whoa,
Trigger! Wesley Posvar, the great
deal-maker who built the
University of Pittsburgh into a
world-renowned university,
probably was merely offered the
retirement packages he is being
crucified for today and should
not be villainized as the
perpetrator of cormption.

This city, university, and state
treasury guards should cease this

shark frenzy over money and_

Pitt News goes downhill

Your last two issues have
reaffirmed the convictions of
many: The decline of this
publication as ‘a respectable
newspaper is continuing
unabated

I am ‘referring to your selective
reporting that constantly
highlights your favorite special-
interest groups at the expense of
respectable journalism.

Onjune 19 you had two articles
on the ‘welcome home” parade
downtown There were 200,000
people cheering our troops, yet
you gave as much, if not more,
coverage to 30 peace-at-any—cost
airheads. It’s amazing how you
can equate the newsworthiness
of 200,000 versus 30 and consider
it equal.

The June 26 issue had a photo
on the front page of gay men
kissing. The photo was offensive
to most, and The Pitt News acted
irresponsibly by advertising such
warped behavior. Homosexuals

should realize that their public 0

antics and asinine rhetoric are
backliring, and heterosexuals
now view them with even more
contempt. A , ‘
The views of newspaper
editors have their place in the
editorial page. But some PittNews
editors use the entire paper to
publicize their darling special—_
interest groups and belittle those
who aren't “politically corre<:t.7’

Quit trying to shove leftist.

garbage down our throats, and
focus on unbiased journalism.

Be carefulwhen stereotyping

After reading the July 10 issue
of The Pitt News, I would like to
recommend that the writers and

editors on staff at The Pitt News 1.

be more concise in labeling
groups of people. The term “pro-
life” does not accurately reﬂect
the ideology of people who
protest legalized abortion; I
suggest that “anti-abortion” is

more accurate forlthis group of ’

people who oppose abortion
and an individual’s choice in the
matter. Many major newspapers
currently use the term “anti-
abortion” to label abortion
protesters; the continued use of
the term “pro-life”. by The Pitt
News to describe this group is
inappropriate and disturbing.
However, I commend the use of
the "pro—choice" label for those
who do favor the option of
choosing to have or not have a
legal abortion when faced with

. the decision, as this is an accurate‘

reﬂection of that group's position
on the matter. I agree with Oren
Spiegler’s letter in the same issue:
There are no “pro-abortionists,”
or for that matter, “anti-lifers."

eHow to avoid credit-card traps

You’ve seen the tables, the
ones in the union. “Apply Here
Today!” says the sign. And there’s
always an incentive. Candy bars
are handed out, along with
certificates for 10 percent off your
first purchase. Last year, At&T
even gave away an $8 check
made out to them for
reimbursement on your first
calling—card bill.

You guessed it! I’m talking
about credit cards. And, they’re

{—§~not all bad  you just have to
know how to handle them.

As everyone knows, the time
to establish credit is NOW! Why
do we need credit cards to prove

it? At this point, WHO CARES?

Who cares why? Who cares about
what we will do with our credit
lines in the future? A little silver
piece of plastic with our name,
expiration date and account
number are all we need these
days to have fun.

The send us subliminal
messages, and we fall for them.
There wasn't a night that went by
last year when I didn’t have the
urge to call at least one mail-order
organization. And I have the
CitiDollars to prove it.

I was one of those who swore
never to use my credit cards,
except, of course, in emergencies.

And then, three months and
seven calls to J. Crew later, lunch
at Hemingway’s becomes an
“emergency situation.”

But then, the payment game
starts. Here’s how to begin.

Step One: Max your cards. All
of them. Get that Citibank Visa to
$600, that Chase to $800. Hell,
charge away! Go to Shadyside!
Go to Oxford Center! Eat out

A anywhere that accepts credit every

day of your life! Charge hair spray
and toothpaste! The goal is to
meet the charge minimum at every
establishment in the Pittsburgh
area! Go! Go! Go!

Letters

Step Three: Call the folks.
Explain that you needed clothes
because it’s a lot colder out in
Pittsburgh than you thought it
would be. Don’t tell them about
the food. That would just be
plain stupid. Pray that they won’t
ask for a copy of the bill.

Step Four; Get the card paid
off with any money you can find.
Sell plasma. Take up smoking so
you can be paid for research at
Western Psych.

Step Five: Credit cards are paid
off — you’re fine. But  what’s
this? No money in the checking
account? What to do? GO TO
STEP ONE. DO NOT PASS GO.
DO NOT COLLECT $200.

The best remedy to stop playing
these games?

Well, you can stop applying
for every piece of plastic that
exists in the free world, or
realistically, you can send each
card you receive (except one) to
your parents, thereby preventing
yourself from using them.

The Credit Card Game will
never end. It’s here to stay, and
rather than worrying about
interest charges and late-payment
fees, resist the urge to hand over
information about yourself on
every application that you can
get your hands on.

Baseball, happiness anal... politics?
David W. Matta

Yes, that’s right. It’s just past themidway point in
the season 0’ baseball, and everyone is wondering
how the rest of the season will go. Well, not me.
Actually, yes, I am wondering that a little bit, but I

’ am also wondering about the philosophical

. questions concerning America’s pastime. Baseball
is not the fine sport that it used to be in its “golden
years,” as some people are apt to call them.

The game of baseball has changed a great deal
over the course of time, and that is not necessarily

,,.,.a good thing or a bad thing. A lot of people think

Vfthat the recent increase in players’ salaries to an

unprecedented and unforeseen level has tarnished
the players’ attitudes and the game forever.

You will often hear of older fans who now refuse
to go to the games or to follow the teams because
they think the players and the game have been
corrupted too much by money and greed.

So, is it true? Well, yes and no. Let’s face it. The
whole world has changed a great deal over the, oh,’
last 100 years, shall we say. No aspect of American
life has remained unchanged, from health practices

ﬂto the Catholic Church. So why should baseball be
i ‘{",any different? Because we all wanted it to? Because
baseball has been the source allthat is good in the
world to "so many people for so long?

The answer is yes. And no. That is why we all
expected it to stay the sa me. The reason it couldn‘t
is because it changed along with the rest of the

at the ball park sniffing yourself with hot dogs and
peanuts and yelling at the umpire. However, it
costs a little more to do so; the stadiums are
modern ; you get to see instant replays on the full-
color screen, and you can also have lobster and
beer from around the world.

One of the problems today with American
culture is that we all think that if you get paid tons
of money or you are an important figure in society,
then that gives us free reign to insult you and probe’
into your life for indiscretions as much as we want.

Money and/or celebrity status do not make one
superhuman or invulnerable to mistakes or
. humiliation. The only people who do deserve such
scrutiny of their behavior or practices are those
who ask for it by shooting off their mouths or those
who just generally act like a horse’s patooty. ‘
Just look at how many people,have been publicly
embarrassed and sometimes even destroyed by
having their personal lives put under the
microscope: people in medicine, sports,
business and politics. This trend in contemporary
American society has got to stop, or else it just
might further ruin our world as we know it. _
Baseball itself will return to the great American
sport that it has always been, but only if it returns
to more traditional values of ethics and morals as
well. People can only ever be expected to be
human. We just need to teach our people to be
better human beings. The rest will take care of .
itself. Even baseball. Even the likes ofjose Canseco.
Well, we can only ask for so much.

Mandatory caption
decoders are unlawful

Many television shows in
this country are closed
captioned. When a closed-
caption decoder is used with
a television, the \words that
are spoken by the people on
TV shows appear ,on the
television screen in the form
of printed text. This helps
people who are hearing
impaired to watch television.

    

Danel
Alman

The federal government
recently passed legislation,
which starting in 1995 will
require all newly
manufactured televisions with
screens of 13 inches or larger
to include built in closed-
caption decoders. Iwould like
to state why I am against this
law.

At present, anybody who
wants a closed-caption
decoder can purchase one. It
is very easy to connect one of
these devices to a television

' S€[.

‘‘ Before this law was passed,
years before‘ this law was even
introduced as a bill, closed-
caption decoders . were
available to consumers.

So what will this law do?

b What difference will there be

when this law comes into
effect? ,

Well, starting in 1993, it will
be illegal to build a television
with a 13-inch or larger screen
that does not include a built-
in caption decoder.

Let us consider a possible
future scenario. It is 1995. I
have just manufactured a
television with a 20-inch
screen. It does not include a
caption decoder.

Have I hurt anybody? No.

Have I threatened anybody?
NO.  *

Have I done anything at all
which‘ could be considered
bad, evil or wrong? No.

And yet, with this new law,
what I did would be illegal.
Yes, that’s ’ right, . by
manufacturing this television

set, I will have turned myself
into a criminal!

Right now it is 1991. At
present, most people who buy
televisions in this country do
not ~ purchase caption
decoders. I

There is a reason for this.
Approximately 92 percent of
U.S. citizens have normal
hearing,
Preventionis Giant Boole of
Health Facts, and do not want
to pay the extra cost of a
caption decoder.

Right now, when you buy a
television, you can choose

whether or not you purchase ‘

a caption decoder.

Starting in 1993, this choice
will be gone. If you wish to
purchase a television with a-
13-inch or larger screen, you

will have to pay the extra cost-

of a computer chip that
decodes closed-caption
signals, even if you don’t want
it.

This new law will add about
$15 to the price of television
sets. But the primary reason I
oppose this law is not
economics. My main reason
for opposing it: It violates our’
right to choose. .

My mother is hearing‘

impaired. She uses a caption
decoder when she watches
television. But government
legislation was not necessary
for her to purchase her
decoder. Instead, she chose,’
on her own free will, to
purchase it.

When I told my mother
about this new law,_she
replied, “That’s terrible." My
mother also believes in,

freedom of.choice. Even L‘

though she is hard of hearing,
she is still against this law. 
The people who do support
this law want us to believe
that it will help people who

_ are hearing impaired. But if

my mother could purchase a
caption decoder without this
law, then what's stopping
anybody else? '

Just because something is a
good idea does not mean that
it should be mandated bylaw.
Exercising, eating right and
abstaining from smoking are
all things which are good for
us. But that doesn’t mean that
they should be required by
law. '

of exactly that.

been investigating the “Ex-

Presidents,” a group of bank

robbers who dress up as Lyndon
B.Johnson, Richard Nixon,Jimmy

robbing banks for four years —
suspiciously, only during the
summer months — and the FBI
has no leads.

Utah is paired up with Angelo
Pappas (Gary Busey), an 18-year
veteran who has his own theory
about the Ex-Presidents.

Pappas believes they are a
group of surfers who only steal
enough cash to live from year to

Hip-hop recordsfor the summer

By Brian Berger
The Pitt News
The fake one (Gerardo) asked for it, and it was
delivered. The funk is in, and the summer of
1991 might go down as hip—hop’s ﬁnest. Riding
the hype of De La Soul's mid-May release, white
groovesters 3rd Bass and the Ruler Slick Rick
each released LPs in the last month, and my
summer hasn’t been the same since. .
With a Public Enemy five-songer due soon
(entitled Can? Tmstlt) and a ridiculously groovy
debut from The Leaders Of The New School, I’ve
gotta work on my moves. Just a tip of the helmet
to those acts — let’s get to the meat of the lineup.

De La Soul
De La Soul 15 Dead
Tommy Boy Records

A stunning second outing from these Amityville
(N.Y.) rappers. This fecord swings so much that
it hasn’t left my Walkman in over two months.
Drop the “hippie rap” adages, and bounce like
a ball, y’all. The Soul breaks all sound barriers
again as it lays down subtle grooves over
“thesaurus” lyrics.

The first time out (3 Feet High And Rising) the
songs kinda sneaked up on me. With each listen
l’d discover a new jam that was funkier than the

beats. »
Posdnous and Trugoy are second only to
Chuck D. in style, and while D. does it with
power, The Soul does it with Suave. Shampoo

Every tune on the record is funk—nasty, including
the sampling above from “A Roller Skating Jam
Na med ‘Saturdays, ”’ which borrows an incredible

beat from “Grease.” “Bitties inthe BK Lounge” is
a delirious look at fast-food employees and
includes the mosthappening 30 seconds in rap
when DJ Maseo breaks into the rap style. My
faves include: “Shwingalokate,” “Keepin’ The
Faith” and “Talkin’ Bout Hey Love.” But it doesn't’
matter —- do as the Japanese do, “just buy it.”

Slick Rick
The Rulers Bacle
Def jam Recordings

All year long I've been hearing the mad rumors
about Sir Slick. Supposedly, he killed his cousin
and another man who broke into his house
trying to steal all his money. Then I heard he shot
someone on the street because he was talking
about Slick’s 16-year-old girlfriend.

There were more, but I let ‘em ﬂy ‘til I found
out the real deal. Yes, the Rickie D. did fire his
gun; it was at his cousin‘;-and he hit him in the
foot (Thanks, Mel) because he was scappingt
money from Rickie’s gigs. So, Rick got busted for .
attempted murder, but with good behavior he’ll
be out in a year. Slick Rick and good behavior ~
don’t mix, but The Ruler and Vance Wright are '
the right combination. .

On his first record, Rickie proved his greatness
with- “Moment I Feared,” an ironic song that
landed Rickie in jail for capping a pimp, and then
he became a public figure on the TV for a while.
Fantasy turned reality for the man who began as
the DJ for Doug E. Fresh back in the day.

While he was awaiting his sentencing, The
Grand Wizard cut 24 tracks and a host of videos
for the Def Jam stable. Russell Rush knows great
rap —— so much‘ he even offered to put up
Rickster’s bail money so they could get his long-
awaited second LP in motion.

No one in the world raps like him, whether it’s «

[Lively DJ/directordreams of the big time at WPTS—FM

/A—\

By Ross Pasquale

Entertainment Editor

Not to be confused with Audrey
Home, the siren played by
Sherilyn Penn in David Lynch’s
late, lamented “Twin Peaks,”
WPTS—FM summer program
director Alicia Horn hails not from
the Pacific Northwest, but instead
from the small (population 5,011)
town of Cortland, Ohio.

lOf the slightly more famous

‘A’ Miss Horne, Alicia claimed, “She’s

my sister. She got the looks; I got
the brains.” Those brains helped
snag her the spot on “PTS” staff as
the acting program director in the
summer absence of Chu ck Morris
(of the famous “Chuck Squared”
duo).

“I’m here because I _like this
music,” said Horn, watching as
her interviewer swiveled in

_ Production Room B’s famous

flawed chair. Horn received her
license at the end of the spring
term and has since been up at the
station every day, making sure
things are running smoothly.
Horn, a French/Japanese major,
is studying abroad next year in

Japan, although she claims no
ﬂuency in the language. She also
works full time at AT&T this
summer as an overseas operator
and loves talking to people from
all over the world.

‘ “I like foreigners, I like talking
to different types of people. I’m a
people person. Certain
stereotypes are kind of true for
certain countries. You hate to
stereotype things, but there are
stereotypes. They’re not
necessarily bad.”

After graduation, she’d like to
work for the government. Like
Clarice Starling, FBI, ‘from Silence
of the Lambs? “I’d like to be some
kind of a diplomat. I’ve just been
thinking, over the last couple of
weeks, of joining the Peace Corps.
But, I don’t know. I don’t know if
I’m qualiﬁed, you know, just going
to college and having a degree in
languages  I'd like to just help
people, more of a social thing‘
than a construction or a medical
thing."

something wrong with me or

anything,” she continued,
attributing her rejection more to
SAT scores than mental
incompetence;

“It’s a lot more interesting than

wild college town of Oakland.
