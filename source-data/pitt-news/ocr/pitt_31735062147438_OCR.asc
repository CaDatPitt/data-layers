I-F Dance Group
Will Reduce Fees
For Parking Lots

Jane Booth, Frederick, Will Lead
Dance; Grandiloquent Favors
Assured At All‘ air Friday

Frank,Frederick, C36, president of

‘Theta Chi, and Jane Booth, Ed36, of

the Delta Delta Deltas, will headline,
if the chairman and his friend do
that, the formal Interfraternity Ball
at the \Villiam Penn Hotel Friday
evening. A

But that’s not all.

The admission price is $3 a couple,
the showing, of which ticket will en-
title the holder to a substantial reduc-
t.ion in parking charges at the Grant

‘Parking lot, 627 Grant Street.

And then, the women will each be
rewarded with a regulation program-
favor and a favor in addition. These
extra favors are novel, new, and
grandiloquent, in the opinion _of Al
Dixon, C36, publicity chairman,

The music will be that of Tal Henry
and his North Carolinians, who ap-
peared recently at the Carnegie Tech
Junior Prom. The ba.nd has broad-
cast from the Hotel New Yorker over
the NBC networks, and is well known
for its Victor recordings and Vita-
phone movie shorts.

According to his ever-helping press
release, Tal Henry has made several
stage tours in the leading theaters of
the country, and has played before
thousands of dancers in most of Amer-

,ica’s best-known ballrooms.

Delegation Elects
Permanent Heads

Group Prepares For Intercollegiate
Conference On Government

In preparation for the third annual
meeting of the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Government, meeting in Har-
risburg, April 24-26, the University
Delegation elected its permanent offi-

_ "cers Sunday.

William Stark, C38, and Morton
Bluestone, C38, were elected chair-
man and secretary of the group, re-
spectively, at a -meeting held at the
home of Miss Genevieve Blatt. grad-
uate assistant in political science.

According to Stark, the group has

been divided into nine committees, for
the purpose of studying past plat-
forms, and for drawing up model
planks, to be discussed, and drafted
into the state-wide platform, at Har-
risburg. . _
. “VVe feel,” Stark continued, “that if
students acquaint themselves with
platforms of the past, they will be
qualiﬁed to draft a model platform,
upon which any student would be
proud to run. It is our intention to
make our platform as practical as pos-
sible. without exceeding the limits of
logic.”

“Furthermore,” he continued, “this
research. into past platforms will be
of some practical use to those who
some day may become involved in po-
litical -conventions.”

The committees, and subsequently
the planks of the platform will in-
clude those on Foreign Relations; La-
bor Relations; Agriculture; Money
and Banking; Natural Resources; So-

cial‘ Security Legislation; Taxation
and Government Finance; Public
Utilities; and Government Organiza-
tion.

Any student interested in a project
of this sort, is invited to join the
group, by contacting any of the pres-
ent members or Miss Blatt.

Student Christian
Movement Landed

YM Traveling Secretary Praises
Federation At Monday Club

Dr. Hugo Thompson, traveling sec-
retary of the YMCA, addressed the
Freshman Club Monday noon, as the
group held its ﬁrst meeting in its
newly remodeled headquarters in the
dining room of the old Oakland Meth-

odist Episcopal Church.

Dr. Thompson explained the pur-
pose and workings of the World Stu-
dent Christian Federation, a universal
organization of students for the fur-
thering of Christianity. The mem-
bers, according to Dr. Thompson,
come from all corners of the globe.

The greatest value of the federa-
tion lies in the fact that it “furnishes
a link to band together students of
all lands.” He told of the difficulties
which its maintenance entails. A
great variety of religious sects are in-
cluded, and members speak many dif-
ferent languages. But in spite of
these and other hindrances, the fed-
eration _has developed into a powerful
organization.

“The organization was the only one
international group which stood the
strain of the World War,” the Y sec-
retary said. He stated that during
the chaos following the War in 1919,
the group held a meeting at which all
the participating nations were repre-
sented, even Germany and the other
Central Powers.

New Cathedral Lounge
Open To All The Boys

In order to clear up a supposition
that the new men’s lounge in the
Cathedral is a part of the YMCA
activities, the following explana-
tion is made:

The temporary smoking and
lunch room, in Room 817, Cathe-
dral, is an experiment to determine
the best uses to which such a room
ca.n be put as a part of the per-
manent set—up for the men’s ﬂoor.

ture have been provided for the
use and convenience of men stu-
dents. Those who bring their
lunch are urged to eat here rather
than in the halls and vacant class
rooms. It is hoped that this room,
which is under the general super-
vision of the office of the dean of
men, will be used by all groups of
students as a common meeting
place. Any suggestions that will
help toward a more effective use
of the room are welcomed.

McKay To Speak
On Vitallssues  
At Dormont Club

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics, will address the Dormont
New Century Club this evening at
8:30 o’clock on the topic, “Vital Cur-
rent Economic Issues.” He will speak
in place of Dr. Francis D. Tyson, pro-
fessor of economics, whose talk has
been postponed until later in the
month.

According to Dr. McKay, the ad-
dress will deal with the “extent to
which We have already emerged from
the depression.” It will include a dis-
cussion of the agricultural situation,

the unbalanced budget, the effects of
Supreme"

the soldiers’ bonus, the
Court decision a.nd will conclude with
a reference to what Dr. McKay terms
“the complex situation we ﬁnd in or-
ganized labor——the conflict between
John L. Lewis, president of the United

Mine Vvorkers, and ‘William Green,"

president of the American Federation
of Labor.”

Dr. McKay was also scheduled to
address the. Ingram Board of Trade
yesterday on “The Finance and Tax
Situation in Pennsylvania.”

State Reiterates
Tax Regulations

Campus Organizations Required
To Apply For Tax Exemptions

Because of the confusion on the
University campus concerning the
taxes on social functions, the oﬂice of
the dean of men has announced the
federal, state, and local regulations
covering all campus affairs for which
an admission charge is made. A sum-
mary of these follows:

The federal government, department of
internal revenue, requires a. ten per cent
amusement tax to be added to the pur-
chase price of all tickets priced over 40
cents. Applications for exemptions for
student organizations should be made
through the department of internal reve-
nue oﬂices in the Federal Building.

Although there is no direct city tax on
admission prices for amusements, all af-
fairs held in a public building for which
an admission is charged, must secure a
city permit, priced at $1. Permits should
be secured at the Mayor's office.

Separate permits for all University af-
fairs charging admission must be secured
from the Pennsylvania department of rev-
enue, stamp and amusement tax division.
Exemptions from the state amusement tax
will be granted only to those affairs from
which the University receives the entire
net proﬁt. In addition to the permits, all
affairs whose proﬁts are not given to the
University, must collect a one-cent tax on
all 25 cents admissions or fractions there-
of. Forms or information can be procured
from the Department of Revenue, 409
Plaza Building. , ,

Radio Series Planned
By Avinolf, Jennings

Two University professors will in-
augurate a series of radio broadcasts
about scientiﬁc expeditions, beginning
next Friday at 6:15 o’clock over Sta-
tion KDKA, and continuing weekly at
that hour.

Dr. Andrey Avinoff, advisory pro-
fessor of biology, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, and director of the Car-
negie Museum, assisted by Dr. 0. E.
Jennings, professor and head of the
department of biology, and Miss Jane
White of the Museum will direct the
series.

The purpose of these broadcasts is
to acquaint the entire public with the
work of the Museum. Trips to the
Twin Islands of the North and to the
Western part of the United States
will constitute some of the expedi-
tions discussed.

 

Engineers’ Publication

Taking on a new aspect with an
editorial policy similar to that of the
Pitt Panther, The Nitt Pews, publica-
tion of the engineering students,
makes its appearance on the campus
tomorrow for the ﬁrst time this se-
mester. The editors, who prefer to
remain anonymous, say they have pre-
pared a masterpiece.

Druids Will Move
To Revise Rules

New Proposals Raise Scholastic
Average, Unlimit Membership

To revise the sections of the Druid
constitution referring to eligibility of
candidates and the method of their se-
lection, the Druid executive commit-
tee, in a meeting Sunday, decided to
recommend certain changes to the ac-
tive membership.

The executive committee, headed by
Frank Engel, Ph&E38, will propose
that the scholastic rating of a pros-
pective candidate be raised from 1.0
to 1.3, and that to be eligible, a fresh-
man must have been outstanding in
at least two major activities or in one
major sport and one other activity.
The present constitution requires at
least four activity points, without‘
specifying where they may be earned.

The most radical change in the
present system of election of new
members is the move to make the to-
tal membership unlimited. This calls
for the tapping of an unlimited num-
ber of candidates both in May and in
February, through what has been ten-
tatively set up as a tl1ree—fourths ma-
jority vote. In the fall tapping, the
number is still limited to four, to be
elected by a preferential ballot.

These proposals will be passed up-
on at the next meeting of Druids, to
be held at the Pi Lambda Phi house
on Sunday, February 23.

Members of the executive commit-
tee who made these proposals include,
besides Engel, Jackson Sigmon, C38,
vice president; James Datillo, C38,
secretary; Andrew Moffett, C38, treas-
urer; and Paul Kohberger, C38, social
chairman.

Petitions will be available all this
week for ﬁrst semester sophomores
who wish to ﬁle their candidacy for
membership. They are due at the
dean of men’s office Friday.

Inter-Culturals

 

The ﬁrst meeting of the Inter-Cul-
tural Associates this semester will
be held today at 3:30 o’clock at the
Heinz House. Mr. Frederick P. May-
er, associate professor of English,
will speak on “Great Modern Amer-
ican Novels.”

Annabelle Bucar, 038, will preside
at the meeting.

For the second consecutive year,
‘Theodore Viehman and Gene Kelly
have been named by the Graduate
Cap and Gown Club to direct the an-
nual show scheduled tentatively for
the week of April 20 at the Nixon
Theater.

As in last year’s
Soup,”
the show, in charge of production,
while Kelly will be assistant direc-
tor, in charge of the dancing numbers.

show, “In the

Number One, federal unit of the WPA
in Chicago. Kelly, a former Cap
and Gown star, has dancing schools
in Pittsburgh and in Johnstown.

According to Theodore W’. Biddle,
assistant to the dean of men and
chairman of the production commit-
tee of Cap a.nd Gown, “The production_
committee feels that the success
which Viehman and Kelly had with

' the show last year merits their being

selected to direct the new Cap and
Gown production. Under their direc-
tion, with a good play, we expect a

' show as good as any produced by Cap

and Gown in recent years.”

Viehman has directed shows in all
parts of the country. A native of
Pittsburgh, he made his debut as a
director with the Guild Players here
from 1919-1925. He has traveled twice
to Europe to study the theater. “The
Curtain Rises,” and “Every Thurs-
day,” Broadway shows, were under
his direction. He also directed the
Harvard “Hasty Pudding” shows of
1933 and 1934.

Two years ago Gene Kelly was feat-
ured in the Cap and Gown “Hello
Again,” as a solo dancer, For three
years as an undergraduate, Kelly was
active in Cap and Gown productions.
He is a member of the Chicago As-
sociation of Dancing Masters and the
American Society of Dancing Teach-
ers.

Plans for the production of the
show and the setting of deﬁnite trial
dates will be completed during Vieh-
man’s visit to Pittsburgh over the
week-end.

The production committee, headed
by Theodore XV. Biddle, is considering
the manuscripts submitted by stu-
dents to select the ﬁnal play for pro-
duction.

Other members of the committee
are: Gus A. Schnabel, Dr. Benjamin
Levant, Louis M. Fushan, G. Norman
Reis, John M. St. Peter, John I-Iarp—
ster, and Jackson Allen.

Five Engineering
Seminar Groups

Five engineering seminars convene
at 11:30 o’clock tomorrow for their
second meeting of the semester. Two
seniors in the civil engineering depart-
ment will present papers to their sem-
inar on technical subjects. “Cement
Bound Macadam Roads” is the subject
of the paper to be presented by Albert
Barr, and James J. Fogarty will read
on irrigation in Room 306, Cathedral.

Harry Restofski, manager of the
personnel department of the West
Penn Power Company, will address

search at Mellon Institute. Dr. Wake-
man will speak on “Modern Plastics.”

Both the industrial engineering
seminar, held in Room 242, Cathedral,
and the combined AE-ME seminar, in
Room 248, Cathedral, will have stu-
dent speakers. Students other than
those in engineering are invited to at-
tend these seminars.

English Lecturer Declares ,
League May Soon Dissolve

 

S. K. Ratcliﬁe, eminent English jour-
nalist was entertained yesterday

at a tea given by the faculty of the
School of Business Administration in
conjunction with Mrs. ‘Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, adviser on nationality rooms
for the Cathedral.

. Mr. Ratcliffe pointed out several in-
teresting facts concerning the pres-
ent socio-political situation abroad.
Among them was the fact that, de-
spite England’s outwardly friendly
attitude toward Germany, particularly
in the recent naval treaty, there is a
great deal of anti-German sentiment
in England directed especially at fasc-
ism and Hitler. He substantiated his
statement further by emphasizing
that the great amount of fervor in
favor of communism at the last elec-
tion was due largely to this same anti-
fascist sentiment.

Mr. Ratcliffe seemed skeptical con-
cerning the future existence of the
League of Nations. The League, he
declared, will probably dissolve when
England, its most prominent support-
er, along with -France, arranges for a
peaceful settlement with Italy in the
present Ethiopian controversy. The
terms made, said Mr. Ratcliffe, will

_, be to the advantage of Italy at the ex-

pense of Ethiopia.
to be inevitable.

Mr. Eberhart, instructor in econom-
ics at the University, asked the lec-
turer if Italy’s present colonization
program wasn't similar to England’s
in the past and likened ’England’s at-
titude toward Italy to a poker player
who had won all but a few of the
chips and wanted to call a halt to the
game. Mr. Ratcliffe denied this posi-
tion, stating that England, if she de-
cided to change her attitude toward
colonization, must do so and answer
later to the charges of the world
about a redistribution of her terri-
tories.

Referring to the sanctions against
Italy, Mr. Ratcliffe declared that sev-
eral of the minor sanctions had ac-
complished a great deal more than
had been expected in the short time
they had been in operation.

Regarding public doles and new
housing, Mr. Ratcliffe declared that
employment conditions in England
were for the most part very similar
to those existing at present in this
country.

The tea was attended by members
of the :School of Business Administra-
tion, other members of the University
faculty, and outside guests.

Debaters Return
From Two-Week
Southwest Tour

Brandon, Goldberg See Ten States,
Meeting 11 Colleges On Two
Topics: Court, Medicine

Albert D. Brandon, C36, and“ Israel
L. Goldberg, C36, were back in class
yesterday after a two-weeks’ debating
tour into the Southwest. Dr. W. M.
Parrish, who accoinpaniedwthe’team,
was again teaching his public speak-
ing classes.

The men re-ported extremes of
temperature——eight below at Cincinna-
ti and 80 above at San Antonio. But
they spoke of uniformly warm wel-
comes throughout the trip.

“Our only real complaint,” they
told The Pitt News, "concerns the slow
trains through Arkansas. Because we
missed a connection at Texarkana by
two hours, we had to add an 80-mile
taxi ride to our expense account. And
even after that dash, we were teamin-
utes late in getting to the debate.”

All told, there were 11 debates in
the tour. Two dec_isions,'_at the.Uni-
versity of Te.xas,'Austin,'ai1d‘. at Bay-
lor University, Waco,’ Texas,'- went
against the University duo. "The
others,” the team was quoted, “didn’t
make us feel so bad.”

Brandon and Goldberg, speaking for
limitation of the power of the Su-
preme Court, met the University of
Cincinnati, Bethel College, O-uachita
College, Centenary College, Rice In-
stitute, University of Oklahoma, and
Ohio State University, as well as Tex-
as and Baylor.

Freshmen Of 1940 Lead Ideal
Life By Comparison With

the other. The most striking instance of the study
came when a list of the 97 most worthy, success-
ful. or eminent was drawn up and checked against
a list of the 93 with the highest college grades.
The two lists contained no less than 87 names in
common.

From this it is fairly evident that scholastic
achievements do not exactly stand in one’s way in
worldly life. Students who have been doing some
old-style rationalizing about the poor grades they
received may gather from these ideas that it will
pay them to open the academic throttle and also
the textbooks this semester.

Blueprint Blues

Y THIS TIME all the blueprints, showing the
results of the past se1nester’s scholastic cam-
paign, should have reached the home front

Those who have made the grades, so to speak,
are no doubt basking in the light of praise well-
intended and equally well-received. Likewise, those
whose records show only the lower letters of the
grading system should have the home folks pretty
well in hand after pointing out to them that grades
aren’t everything.

It is perhaps fortunate that no one of the latter
group has had to ‘point that out to Dr. Hugh A.
Smith of the University of \Visconsin. Dr. Smith
recently wrapped himself in a two-year research,
studying the records of 1,800 graduates who had
been out in life from 15 to 45 years to ﬁnd out just
what happened to the good, bad, and mediocre stu-
dents in the list. \Vhat Dr. Smith found knocked
into a wom'an’s new chapeau the common notion
that the brilliant student in college is likely to
fail in practical life.

The results of his ﬁndings, an unbelieveable
agreement between scholastic success and wordly
success, astonished even Dr. Smith. If a man was
high in one list, l1e_ was almost invariably high in
the other‘ ;if- low in one, he was generally low in

Collegiate
Class Of 1910

“Take heed, therefore, Ye miserable
dogs, Ye nothingness Ye!”

So reads a proclamation to fresh-
men. But not to the freshmen of
1940, does the decree of September
13, 1907 apply. Ye who now enter
our ranks shall be treated as respect-

able men and women, respectively;
and ye shall receive treatment thereto
appertaining. But when in former days
the freshmen were degraded, upbraid-
ed nothingnesses, and upperclassmen
their inﬁnite superiors, it was a dif-
ferent matter.

The proclamation was received by
Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, assistant pro-
fessor of English, who is writing the
history of the University for the ses-
quicentennial anniversary next year.
The donor of the proclamation was
Dr. T, F. McBride, instructor in oper-
ative dentistry at the University.
The proclamation reads:

Art Science Assembly
To Hear Elliott’s Talk

Assistant Arts Professor To Discuss
“Relation Of Art To Photography”

Philip C. Elliott, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, will lecture before the
Academy of Science and Art, on “The
Relation of Art to Photography,” at
the Carnegie Lecture Hall, tomorrow
evening at 8:30! o’clock.

“The meteoric rise of photography
in recent years has created much
speculation concerning its possible
status as a legitimate form of art ex-
pression,” says Mr_?E1liott. “Unlike
painting, photography has no great
past and no traditions, and its meth-
ods are peculiar to our own time.”

In discussing the possibilities of
photography as art, Mr. Elliott will
use slides, both of modern photo-
graphs and of painting, from the ﬁles
of the ﬁne arts department. The lec-

ture is open to the public after 8:15
o’clock.

Important Meeting

A compulsory meeting of all Mili-
tary Ball committees will be held
Friday at 4 o’clock in Room 1128,
Cathedral.

Varsity Tankmen
Meet State Next

‘To Tangle With Lions Saturday;
Relayers Place In AMA Event

Riding on the crest of a win streak
-of three straight victories, Coach Pat
Corr’s varsity swimmers will conclude
practice sessions tomorrow, prepara-
‘tory to leaving for State College on
Saturday morning for a dual engage-
ment with the Nittany Lion natators.

After dropping their ﬁrst start of
the season to Ohio State’s powerful
outﬁt, the Panthers have taken into
camp Delaware, Slippery Rock, and
"Carnegie Tech and are sitting on top
of the heap in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Swimming Association.

This being the ﬁrst year that State
ever had a swimming team, Satur-
-day's meet will mark the initial com-
petition in this sport between teams
-of State and Pitt.

The Centre county collegians em-
barked in this new venture last Sat-
‘urday against Syracuse and met with
defeat. However, indications point to

re. spirited struggle on Saturday after-

noon.

In the AMA indoor championships
held at the Metropolitan pool last
Saturday, Pitt’s two free style relay

-quartets ﬁnished one, two in the 200-
‘yard feature.

The No. 1 team of Walt Nowotny,
Harry Geyer, Bob Prince, and Captain
Russ Lindberg took ﬁrst honors, ne-

gotiating the distance in the fast time

of one minute, 41.1 seconds. Hal Neff.
Tom Locke, John Stiranko, and Tom
Anderuon, the No. 2 outﬁt, ﬁnished in

-second place.

In the fancy diving contest, Red
McQuillan, Panther junior, garnered

"third honors, trailing McTiernan and

Patnik.

Panther Quintet
To Battle Temple
In League Contest

Now that city title worries have
been settled by the Dukes—at least
for another week —- the Panther
basketball squad leaves town over
the weekend in quest of another title.‘
This time it is an Eastern Intercol-
legiate Conference game with the
Temple Owls on the latter’s Phila-
delphia hooting grounds Friday night.

At present, the Panthers are not
in such good standing in the six-team
conference. By splitting the four
games played, the Panthers rest in a
three-way tie for third place honors
with Georgetown and Temple. Car-
negie leads the league, while West
Virginia’s Mountaineers appear next,
one-half game behind. But even
though the schedule has reached the
half-way mark, it is still anyone’s ti-
tle.

All this points out that the game
on Friday with Jimmy Usilton’s Owls
is an important one. The winner
moves into second place, and if Tech
drops its game, a tie for ﬁrst honors.

In the two games between Pitt and
Temple last season, each team took
one victory and one licking. The ﬁrst
game found the Panthers dropping a_.
one-sided game to the Owls in Phila-
delphia, 45-38. It was the Owls’ ﬁrst
win over the Panthers in six years
Back in Pittsburgh a month later, the
order was reversed, and the Panthers
dished out a 34-25 shellacking to the
Temple team.

This season, Usilton has built up
another good team, mostly from soph-
omore and junior material. They
started the season in rare form only
to drop two conference games in a
row to Tech and West Virginia. Late-
ly, however, the Owls seem to have
recovered some of their early season
form, which means that the Panthers

will have to shows improvement over '

their spotty play against the Du-
quesne boys last week.

As usual, Carlson will take ten
players on the trip to the Quaker
City. Ted Roderick, Pete Noon, Bill
J esko, Bob Johnson, Rags Radvansky,
Miles Zeleznick, Ed Spotovich, Joe
Garcia, Frank Loucks, and Luke
Rowe will make the trip to Philadel-
phia.

Upon the return from Philadelphia,
the Golden Cats will meet the Dukes
at the Stadium Tuesday night, in a
return game between the two rivals.
This will be the Panthers’ home con-
test with the Dukes and basketball en-
thusiasts can be certain thatthe Pitt
cagers hope to turn the tables.

Bob, Joe Madden
Lose In Tourneys

Bob Madden, Pitt’s leading net star,
returned Saturday from an unsuccess-
ful quest for the‘Eastern Intercollegi-
ate Indoor tennis crown. After win-
ning his ﬁrst round match from Ed
Emmons, 6-1, 6-1, Bob, who was seed-
ed.No. 2 in the tourney, was upset by
Fred Neubling, City College of New
York star, by scores of 7-5, '7-9, 6-4.

Brother Joe didquite well for him-
self in the Invitation Indoor tourna-
ment being held in Duquesne Gardens.
He advanced to the quarter-ﬁnals by
virtue of a 6-4, 14-12 decision over Jack
Redmond, P. A. A. star on Friday.
Previously he had polished offl Art
Glaser, 6-1, 6-1 in a ﬁrst round match.

In the quarter-ﬁnal match on Sun-
day afternoon, Joe was eliminated by
the district’s No. 1 star, Frank Broida,
in a gruelling three set match, by
scores of 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.

Madden, after easily taking the
ﬁrst set, slackened his pace to lose
the second and even up the match at
one-all in sets. In the ﬁnal canto, Joe
led Broida, 5-4, in games and was
leading, 30-15, on his service," After
playing three deuced points, Broida’s
superior court experience allowed him
to break through Joe’s service, and
he went on to capture the next two
games and the match.

Intramural Basketball
Leagues To Start Soon

Announcements of the proposal In-
tramural basketball program were
sent to all student actirvity groups and
organizations today by Martin J.
Feely, director of Intramural athletics.

With only varsity and freshman let-
ter winners excepted, the basketball
tournament is open to every male stu-
dent in the University, and authori-
ties are making an effort to have an
extensive organization. Campus social
fraternities are already organized, but
court-inclined members of the Engi-
neering and Mines, Campus Activities
Groups, ROTC, Schools of Medicine
and Dentistry, and Independent
groups are urged to get together and
organize teams. for competition.

Entry blanks are available at Trees
Gymnasium and should be obtained
immediately. If all entries are made
by the end of this week the tourna-
ment will get under way about Feb-
ruary 18.

Four Panther Olympic Prospects

Pitt’s Senior Olympic hopes include Sol Menaker, upper left, and Charles
Groat, upper right. Groat, outdoor half-mile champion, battles the indoor
champion, Harold Connelly, in one of the featured races Saturday. Menaker
stars in the sprints. Dick Mason is his only threat in The News meet.

An outstanding squad of junior trackmen includes Red Tost, lower left,
and Bob Gerrety, lower right. Tost, a miler, captained the successful cross-
country team of the past season. Gerrety, Ashtabula flash, features in the
pole vault and broad jump events. Tost also competes in the two-mile run.

‘News Olympics’
Oﬂers Complete
Indoor Program

A complete and elaborate track and
ﬁeld show will change the University
track house into a “miniature Olym-
pics” Saturday, with a ﬂag-raising cer-
emony, parade of officials and con-
testants, and even a presentation of
awards threatening to steal some of
the spot-light from the track and ﬁeld
performers.

Contrary to reports in a local daily
paper, Sunday, the entire Pitt squad
will compete in the Pitt News meet.
Pitt’s relay team participates in the
Michigan Normal relays on Tuesday,
February 18, instead of Saturday.

"The Women's athletic association
of - the University, under Miss Eliza-
beth Rearick, assistant professor of
physical education, will furnish cer-
tiﬁcate awards to the ﬁrst three place-
winners of the 27 championship
events on the program. The awards
will be tied in red, white, and blue
ribbons.

In the presentation of awards, 14
girls have been chosen “sponsors” of
one varsity and the corresponding
freshman event, with the exception of
the two-mile run. Names of the spon-
sors will be announced Friday.

Pre-meet ticket sales indicate that
a large crowd will ﬁll the Indoor track
house and that a large sum will be
raised for the Pitt donation to the
America.n fund. Harold Connelly and
Vvalter Good, senior varsity lettermen,
lead in the individual ticket race,
each having sold more than 40 tickets.
A prize of $5 has been donated by W.
Don Harrison, director of athletics,
to the trackman who sells the great-
est number of tickets.

Carl Olson, varsity track coach,
donated a sum of $3 to the boy who
places second in tickets sold. Robert
K. Graham, Director of University
News Service, contributed a prize of
$1 to go to the third-highest ticket
seller.

James Potts, assistant track coach,
handles the ticket sale. Coach Potts
has organized the track team distri-
bution according to freshman, soph-
omore, junior, and senior divisions. At
the present time, the senior group
sale, leads by a wide margin. Charley
Gongloff, National Intercollegiate jav-
elin, champion, assists Potts.

The indoor championships start
promptly at 1:30 o’clock with the pa-
rade of contestants and officials.

Make Fine Start

Defeat Allegheny Y Mittmen, 7-1;
Bombe Stars For Yearlings

In a promising debut, the Pitt fresh-
man boxers gave the new yearling
sport a good start by dusting off the
Allegheny Y mittmen at the Alle-
gheny Y, 7-1, Monday night.

Bombe bombarded Valdergo into
submission in the second round of the
165-pound contest to furnish the high-
light of the match and to provide Pitt’s
lone win by the technical knockout
route.

The only little Panther defeat was
suffered by Turner, who lost the 145-
pound event to Manke by a technical
knockout.

Four Pitt points were tallied by
three-round decision victories. Bon-
orati, Gray, Iannuzzi, and Horton won
from their respective opponents by
getting the judges’ decision,

The remaining two bouts on the
program were forfeited to Luzinacci
and Lezouski when the Y team was
unable to provide opponents to go into
the ring against the Little Panther
sluggers.

on a rough valve until it is
ready for use. That is a sur-
prising number of operations
for such a simple looking
part, but typical of Ford care
in manufacturing.

The stems of the rough
valves ﬁrst receive two pre-
liminary grinding operations.
Then they go through a fur-
nace where the heads are
brought to a red heat. Next,
automatic ﬁngers place them
in a huge machine Where a
ram strikes the red-hot heads.
This operation refines the
grain structure in the head,
straightens it, and-forms the
valve seat.

Valves then pass through
other grinding, machining and

ness. Inspection gages keep a‘
constant check.

In spite of this care, each
Ford valve is subjected to
rigid ﬁnal inspection. Ampli-
fying gages chcck the stem
for roundncss Within two ten-
thousandths of an inch. Simi-
lar gages check diameter.

Other inspection equip-
ment indicates the slightest
“run out”,of seat and checks

stem end for squarcness. Then

the valves go into a constant
temperature room Where they
are inspected for length.

ﬁne car because it is built like
a ﬁne car. No car at any price
is made to finer precision
limits.
