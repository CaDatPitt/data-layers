Radical changes in the require-,
ments for admission to professional?
courses in the ‘School of Educationig
and higher standards in that
school were announced today by Dr.
L. P. Sieg, acting dean of the School
of Education. The requirements will
go into effect with the opening of
school in September, 1933, and repre-
sent the efforts of Dean Sieg and his
committee in limiting students in the
School of Education to those who are
most ﬁtted and most interested in
that particular work. The School of’
Education last year was made a pro-
fessional school requiring two years
of college pre-education training.

Observation and practice teaching
under the new plan will become an
eight-credit course in September,
1934. In September of this year the
course will be listed as a six-credit
course, embracing the work of one
semester.

Deﬁnite requirements have been
set up for students in other schools
who attempt to enter the teaching
profession by taking several courses
in the School of Education. These
requirements are intended to force
other students to satisfy the speciﬁc
requirements outlined in the Bulletin

of the School of Education for the
major subject in which they plan to
do student teaching.

Students enrolled in the College,
and in the Schools of Business Ad-
ministration, Engineering, and Mines
who wish to fulﬁll Pennsylvania state
requirements for teaching certiﬁcates
must either transfer their registration
to the pre-education group during
their sophomore year or earlier or re-
main in the school of original choice
and elect professional education
courses provided prerequisites are
satisﬁed for the School of Education.

Students who do not__ wish to, trans-
fer are not required to‘ fulﬁll ‘the
School of Education requirements of
a major and two minors related to
the teaching ﬁelds of secondary
schools. Unless students satisfy the
speciﬁc requirements outlined in the
school's bulletin they will not be al-
lowed to take practice teaching under
thedirection of the University.

Under the new plan of organization
the following new requirements are

committee to select candidates for
queen was chosen. Members of the
committee are Ruth 1-Iamilton, Ed.;

ladys Pyle,.Col.; Genevieve Blatt,
Col.; Mary Garber, C01,, and Dorothy

ing to the class cabinet, seniors will"
suggest candidates by placing names
in a ballot box at Heinz House for

own choosing. Voting will be based;
upon the Charlesworth System of
Preferential Voting, whereby the
names of five or six women will ap-
pear on the ballot, which will be de-
clared -void if any names -are added
by the voter. Professor James C.
Charlesworth, instructor of political
science, will count the ballots, and

‘submit the result in :3. sealed enve-
-ilope to be opened on Tap Day.‘

In addition to nominating candi-
dates for queen, the committee will
also name the 75 girls to take part in
the coronation ceremony.

VVhile the choosing of this commit-
tee was the most important ‘business
of the day, several other matters
were discussed. Among them were
the question of senior keys, which, it
was announced by Evangeline Jaffurs,
class treasurer, will be sold for ﬁfty
cents apiece if two l1und1'e-dare or-
dered. or sixty cents if less than that
number are wanted. Miss Isabelle
Anderson,_assistant dean of women,
told the group about the custom of
uniform dresses for senior week and
about the style show to be held for
class members on March 20.

The VVSGA Survey committee re-
ported on the progress of its investi-
gation into the question of how much
use the present senior women‘ expect
to make of the subjects in which they
are specializing and of the effects of
activitieson their academic work.

As a feature of the program, Thyrsa
Amos, dean of women, spoke of the
signiﬁcance and tradition of the coro-
nation ceremony, which is derived
from an old English coronation and
adapted for'acade_mic;usage._ 

A social hour followed the lunch-
eon, under the direction of Georgetta
Scehher, vice president of the class,
and a committee composed of Rebec-
ca VVeber, Estelle Woods, Florence
Brown, Mildred Clark and Elinor
Smith.

Athlet-icvlliept.
Makes -~Change

Appoint James Hagan, Le-
roy Lewis to Offices

James “VVhitey” Hagan, Col, '28,
who for the past four years has served
as assistant athletic director, was ap-
pointed Friday by the athletic board
of the University, to the ofﬁce of
graduate manager of student ath-
letics.

In making the announcement pub-
lic, W. Don Harrison, athletic di-
rector, explained that a graduate man-
ager's office had a place in the or-
iginal athletic setup of the Univer-
sity. “Since the appointment of Karl
E. Davis in 1921 ‘as athletic director,
the office was not ﬁlled, but the di-
rector’s associate was then termed
assistant di1'ector.” The appointment
of Hagan‘ «brings the athletic office to
the same position before the change
was made.

At the same time, Leroy Lewis, Col.
'34, was appointed manager of the
1933 football team. He succeeds James
McFarland and Elmer Rosenbloom,
who acted as co-managers during the

season just completed.

Council Action Approved
by Fraternity Com-
mittee Friday

Same Rules To Govern

 

Second semester fraternity rushing
for men will begin Monday, February
20. and will last for one week only,
according to action of Interfraternity
Council at its meeting Thursday
night. Rushing was previously sched-
uled to open this Friday, but the
Council, in postponing it to the fol-
lowing Monday and in keeping the
same closing date, 2 o'clock Sun-
day morning, February 26, has short-
ened the period by three days.

The resolution of the fraternal gov-
erning body was made ofﬁcial Friday
by the sanction of the Fraternity
Conunittee of the University.

Robert Beck, Bus. Ad. '33, president
of Interfraternity Council and repre-
sentative from Phi Gamma Delta, de-
clared that the action of the group
was instigated in view of the small
number of new freshmen, about 70,
who entered this semester, and who
wil be the principal rushees of this
season. The delegates unanimously
agreed that the shorter rush period
will suffice to take care of not only
new freshmen but also the advanced
freslimen and upperclassmen with
twelve credits and eight quality point
records for the past semester, who
will be eligible for fraternity pledg-
ing.

Beck intimated that the economy
aspect of the shorter period had some
bearing on the decision of the Coun-
cil. He pointed out that since all
dances during the rushing season
must take place on Friday or Satur-
day nights, less of these more costly
affairs will be run, -with the majority
of rush events being in the forms of
theater parties, smokers or card
sessions. '-

In addition, it was said, the change
was recommended so that fraternity
events would not conﬂict with the
Junior Prom, taking place this Friday
night in the Hotel William Penn.

The rules for rushing of men's so-
cial fraternities this time will be the
same as those of the previous sem-
ester. Silenee period will begin at 2
o'clock Sunday morning of February
26 and will extend to Marsh 1. Inter-
fraternity Council again stressed the
importance of fraternities and rushees
observing this period and promised

campus fraternities were censured»
last semester for making infractions
of the silence ruling. .. g

The Ofﬁce of the Dean of Men. an.-
nounces that, as previously, all lI1Vl~
tations to pledge to fraternities must.
be extended and accepted .or.refused
through its channels.

conditions, the vibrations occur at
four second intervals, but when an
earthquake is taking place, the vibra-
tions change to between ten and
twelve second intervals.

Mr. Rutherford spoke about pros-

By synnnetrical treatment the ar-
chitect has cleverly harmonized the
proportion of the irregular room by
separating it into two parts through
the usage ‘of pillars. The main room,
a perfect square, is the inner part and
the small room in front of the window
the outer part.

The ﬂoor of the main room is‘ cov-
ered with rectangular marble slabs.
arranged in a ‘simple design with a
margin of bluish gray marble. The
same bluish gray treatment is used
for the wall wainscoating that acts
as a transition from the whiteness of
the marble ﬂoor to therust colored

The capita.ls‘of pillars and door

ture consisting of a plain table around
which will be placed twelve student
chairs and a -professor's chair. Addi-
tional seats will be a manble bench
placed along the inside wall and two

THE PITT NEWS

“BubbIes’ ’ Rising
In Final Songs

   

Tonight’s Panther radio pro-
gram over TVWSVV at 5:35 will
mark the return to the air of
Betty Burns, feature artist on last
year’s broadcasts. It will also be
the farewell program of “Bubbles”
Rising. Campus dirt will be i
spilled by the Freshman About 
T‘own’s latest mouthpiece, J.
Gardner Smith.

Betty Burns is merely the radio
name for a. sophomore in the Col-
lege. Her return will be appre-
ciated by the Panther’s audience,
 some concern was shown when
she left the programs early last
year. Her featured song for to-
night will be the currently popu-
lar “You're an Old Smoothie.”

The fact that Bubbles Rising
will not be returning to Pitt this
semester necessitates his leaving

the program as a sustaining
feature.
The body of the Freshman

About Town's gossip will be the
“'\Vho’s ‘Who and W'ith T/Vhom”
for the Junior Prom. Charles
Lawrence will announce the pro-
gram.

vN‘ext Tuesday’s broadcast will
be the last of this series. Prepa-
ration is now being made for the
Talent Hunt and contest, details
of which will be announced later.

Mr. Cass’ Pitt Players Portray Domestic Drama of Sel-
ﬁsh Mrs. Craig; Kaufman, Swartz Lead

 

By Sam Honigberg
The drainatic honors thls Tliizrsday iliglit will all go to Carl B-
Cass and his Pitt Players when t.hc_v will present the ﬁna1-peri’orm-

ance of “C-raig"'s \Vife” at the YM & \VHA auditorium.

This they

proved to a. hard-to-please audience at the Ii-one Ku.ul_’1nann Settle-
ment Sunday night when they stagfctl a preview production. of

George Kelly ’s celebrated domestic drmnu.
lenccd soon after the ﬁrst not got under way, and thou t11o_v displayed

The uudieuvie was si-

their entire satisfaction for the rest%

of the pla.y.

The drama has a. life-like character
in the stern Mrs. Craig. She dis-_
courages friends who visit her home
for fear they may ruin her furniture,
fires the maid because she left a let-
ter lying on the living room mantel-
piece, and lectures to her niece not to
consider the man she is to marry but
the kind of home he is able to fur-
nish. "

It isu’t hard to see,’ then, that Mrs.
Craig herself married for the selﬁsh
comforts of a home. These comforts .
she religiously upholds even if it;
means the loss of her husband and
his -friendly aunt, Miss Austen.

But not until his aunt opens the
way for Mr. Craig to see that he is
just another out—of-place ornament in
the house does he re'.1.lize that he was,
after all, the romantic fool so ﬁttingly
labeled by his wife. As for Miss Aus-
ten, she tells him “You haven’t a.
home to furnish me. you have only a
house." This leads to Mr. Craig's
decision to leave his wife andprove
once more that “people who ‘live to
themselves are generally left to them-
selves.’.’

The cast, without an exception, did
splendid work. Their performances
have long since graduated from the
amateur state. ‘

In the unsympathetic part of Mrs.
Craig, Dorotl‘1y‘Ka‘ufman is excellent.
Most of her lines and action were per-
fect indetail. ,'I‘he}sa‘me jmust be re-
peated for Carl Swartz,‘ wl1‘or-stood" out
as Vvalter Craig. Their good work is
particularly noticeable during tlieir
long second-act scene wherein Mrs.
Craig dubs him a romantic fool.

The ,eveni11g’s'1-auglis were due to
Fern VVolf’s‘ clever ‘impersonation of
Mrs. Harold, the housekeeper. Her
candid opinions of her employer of-
fered highly amusing moments. On
the humorous side, Helen Bart as the
maid helps along. _ ,

'Eliza.beth ’Wingerter as Miss Aus-
ten and,Ruth Drum as the neighbor
proved the most lovable characters.
Elaine Blauvelt, Joseph Samson, Her-,
bert Fine, Fred Kiver, and Samuel‘

No Pitt Players review can be com-

plete without some word of praise for

the ﬁne work of Mr. Cass, their di-
rector. Hls association with the play-
ers remind one of Cole.ridge’s_friend-
ship with Wordswortll. Just as Cole-
ridge was the man who aided ‘Words-
worth achieve his greatest success as
a. poet, so is Mr. Cass largely respon-
sible for the worthy productions
staged by the Pitt Players.

Proms, Track Meets
Are Bill Ke||er's

Specialties

   

A boy who is just as comfort-
able in a track suit as in=a tux is
going to lead the grand march
on a certain Friday night not so
very far in the future. William,
more familiarly known as Bill,
Keller, Col. ’:3, Pitt's champ
track star is chairman of the Jun-
ior Prom, February 17, and not
only-tllat, but this is the first time
in the history of dear -old Pitt that
an athlete has tripped around a
ballroom of the Junior Prom
with “cliairman” tagged on to
him. ‘

Although in 1926, the Junior
Prom chairman, Robert Winters.
was a chee1'lcade1', and William
McKee, 1928, chairman’, was the
Varsity football manziger.

. Perhaps ..you. think that because
Bill has run in track meets as far
north as Toronto and as far west
 California, he has no other in-
terest in life. Ah, but he does!
He is cr—_—azy about dancing. His
fraters‘ say, “dancel1ound,” and
his girl friends say, “divine."

Mermen Win
 Two In Easl:

 

Franklin -Marshall, Delaware,
Lose To Panther Splashers

 

The shattering of two records and
l

the sum total of two victories over as
many opponents marked the past
week—end for t.he Pitt swimming team.
‘Both victories were scored over

., .
rivals in the Eastern Intercollegiaﬁl‘
Swimming Association_ and gave the’

l"anther mermen a good start'tow:1rd
the crown. Franklin and Marshall,
and the University of Delaware pro-'
vided what little opposition the Pan-
thers encoimtered.

‘Two pool records and one college:

mark were shattered‘ on Friday night
at the l.<‘ra.nklin and Marshall pool
when two Pitt swimmers rang up a, 37-
22 \'ictory. Both new pool records were
established by Pitt swimmers, while
Clialmers. member of the United
States Olympic swimming team, bet-
tered his own markfor the 100-yard
dash by one second. The Panther
relay team set a new record in the
iirst event on the program, and Cap-
tain Allersberg set. a new record in
the breast stroke event. 1

Delaware managed to score one
first plaice against the Panthers on
Sa.turda_v night, and lost 45-14. "Most
of the‘ events were closely contested,
but the Pitt swimmers managed to
hold a ‘decisive edge:

Notre Dame went ahead by 15 to

A  

 

l.‘~uiversit_v zzthletes are facing an
unusually full schedule. this week
after a more or less disastrous week-
end. \Vith Tech on the bo:~:e.rs’
schedule and Duquesne’s city champs
facing the cagers the Pitt boys are
facing some of the best competition
they have been called on to inect this
year. V

A sligl1t.l_v bruised, and somewhat
l)attered Prlit boxing team is Slowly
being brought back to form through
the herculean efforts of Coach Orsini,
but will likely enter the stadiuni ring
on ’I‘l1ursda.y evening as the under-
dog, when they attempt to defeat
Ernie Sesto’s ﬁghting Tartans.

The Tartaus, who defeated the Du-
quesuo borers in their only start this
season are in. favorable position to
cop the. city boxing title by defeating
the Pantlier boxers. The Pitt team,
which dropped decisions to Vvest Vir-
ginia, Army, and Duquesne, after de-
feiating Temple, hardly appears like-
13' to upset what is commonly called,
the “pre-game dope.”

Charles Junge will make his .sec-
ond appearance as a. Panther boxer,
and will face either Scott or Commut-
cis in the bantamweight class. This
1‘1ght,‘beca.use of Junge’s inexperience
appears to be a toss-up, but Pitt fans
are hoping for “Slim” to come
through with a victory. In the 125-
pound class, George Gambatesc and
Ralph Atlas, of Tech, will exchange
wallops. Both boys hold decisions
over Gibb, of Duquesne, and anything
may happen before the three rounds
are over.

The fight most likely to lilllthe sta-.

dium pavilion is the lightweight. bout,
when Henry Carr, of Tech, and Jim-
m_v Giaunatti of Pitt square oif. Both
boys are natural ﬁghters, but Gian-
natti will be up agaiiist a. much taller
man fo'r”the iirst ‘time I this season.
This bout. can also go either way.

An imp1'oved welterweight, “Red”
Spiegel, a ‘lightweight graduate, will

"attempt to ‘bring a. victory to Pitt
Lowry, Res-

when he meets either
traine, of Kulusc. Little is known of
the Tech boxers, ‘suit is unwise to
make any rash prediction on the re-
sult. "Spie“gel,' who appears to the

7

stages, with J1mge’s superior height
gauti reach being used to advantage.
George Gambatese quickly evened
things up for the Panthers by easily
(lelieating Bob Gibb, Duquesnc in
three rounds. _ ,

Jimmy Giannatti scored the second
Panther victory in easy style with a.
second round technical knockout over
Cyril Brain. Referee (lmylz-oi‘ stop-
ped the uneven light after one min-
ute, ﬁt't_v-tliree seconds of the second
round. Fred Moore, highly touted
Duke welterweight, found the going
rather rocky against Bernie “Red”
Spiegcl, and barely managed to take
the decision. Spiegal scored the only
knockdown of the fight, Iiooring Moore
early in the first round. I

light crowd as another ltubbo, stands
at good chance to grab the decision.

Jack Schricker will make an at-
tempt at mayhem on Hart, of Car-
negie. in the 155-pound class. Schrick-
er holds a. big edge in this affair, and
should‘ add to his string of victories.

Jeri-_v 0‘Too1c, or Tom Coulter will
carry Tech colors in. the 165-pound
class, and will ﬁnd either (i'.ha1'le,v

bouts at the Stadium dressing room

Inside Looking O

...BylV.F.A....

P to the moment of the present writing there is no report of a

harsh word or gesture from President.-elect Roosevelt. In the

words of the long‘-winded Senator from Louisiana, “He is still the
same old Frank, all wool and a yard wide.”

That the incoming President continues to wear his campaign
grin after the, elec,t.i_on,is in the bag seems to be a matter for serious
concern, with Republican editorial writers.

The opinion is that

these are extraordinary
chief cant phrase of the day), and
that a President ought to be extra-
ordinarily severe. If Roosevelt were
acting a little more like 8. Stalin or
Ii Mussolini, he would probably be
pleasing more of the public than he is.

By his present conduct, however. he
is pleasing the politicians. And that
is a commendable thing. The trag-

edy of the Hoover administration was
that Hoover could not play ball with
members of the House and Senate,
even those of his own party. If Mr.

houses by a smile and a firm hand-
shake, we can be grateful. Congress
often looks to the White House for
legislatioli. If the Scvcnt_v-third Cou-

The Roosevelt Prospects

Mr. Roosevelt enters the W’hite
House with better prospects than any
of his three predecessors. I think it
no wild statenlent that Republican
Presidents since the VVoi'ld VVar have

lic has become used to mediocre
measures, to status quo progress. If
Roosevelt's Muscle Shoals plan and
the other plans he apparenitly has up
his sleeve enjoy even a medium de-
gree ofsiiccess, his worshippers will
be legioii.

Wiser than his predecessors, the
President-elect has chosen well in his
advisers. Avoiding the error that
helped in the ruin of one of them, he
has not hesitated to ca.ll in men who
might steal the spotlight. His use of
Professors Tugwell and Moley has
been a. gestilre that ought not to be
witliout, sa.t,i_s,_t'actor_v results. “I hope
that it sets a precedeiit. Experts‘ can
make mistakes, very bad ones in fact;
but they do not make them on pur-
pose, which is more than can be said
for some professional office holders.

It takes no keen brain to determine
that. Rooseve1t’s success will depend
on the depressioil-prosperity breaks
that he gets. A lot of the breaks will
be luck. But some of tlleln will be
“made.” In these will be the test. of
the theories of American progressiv-
ism: for up to now. by his association
with Noi'ri:_: and the other western
progressives, Roosevelt has given
every ‘indication of being one of them.
I hope that he gives the mild sociali-
zation projects of the progressives a
trial. In the first place, I believe that
they would work; and, secondly, the
political scene would be considerably

Opposition Ahead

Too many of the Democrats in Coli-
gress are tlliliking. if at all, in terms
of the lost nineteenth century to allow
Mr. Roosevelt much leeway in new
and different legislatioii. He will
have a hard four year fight against
the Southern Senators and Repre-
sentatives who are for the most part
deﬁnitely 1‘e8.CtlOl1a1‘Y. But the power
that he can wield witliout much co-
ercion is remarkable._. as already has

subsequent acceptance by the Sella-te-
Much of his success d_u'ringA the coin-
ing four years will depend ‘upon his
ability to get similar action. The war
debt mess will probably be the tough-
est of the problems that he must
tackle.

Mr. Roosevelt's greatest liaiidicap
will be the Democratic press that
helped to a large degree to put him
into office. He will naturally feel
some obligation to that press. And
1 indicate a
break with it. Roosevelt is not to be
envied for the foreign policy he must
mulate and follow. Bungling and
propoganda have strailled relations

efforts and not by any help that comes
to him from the more outspoken sec-
tions of his party. If he does not run
afoul of the Deinocratic press within
the next two years on foreign and
domestic policy, Roosevelt will de-
serve some mention as a mighty clever
politician. ,

Alt1io'u'gh none too enthusiastic over‘
Roosevelt's abilities and intentions,
during the campaign, I must confess
that his actions up to the present have
been far more satisfactory than I ever
expected from any Democrat and more
than I would have believed in if tliey
had come from a Republican of the
ordinary variety. If the Muscle Shoals
