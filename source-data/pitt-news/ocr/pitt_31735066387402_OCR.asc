Reagan
addresses

freedom

of people

By Phyllis Messinger

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— On Wed-
nesday, President Reagan hailed
the 200-year-old Constitution as
a ”blueprint for freedom” and
then led thousands of school chil-
dren, federal workers and tourists
in reciting the Pledge of Al-
legiance.

_Short|y'afterward, 100,000 red,
white and blue balloons were
released to end a 3-hour tribute
to the bicentennial of the Consti-
tution.

”Times havechanged, but the
basic premise of the Constitution
hasn’t changed. ' It's still our
blueprint for freedom,” Reagan
told the crowd that filled the west
lawn of the U.S. Capitol.

”For over 200 years, we have
lived with freedom under law,
and perhaps we have become
complacent about it. We should
never forget how rare and pre-
cious freedom is,” Reagan said.

Senate Majority Leader Robert

Byrd, D—W.Va., said Americans ‘

may sometimes ”take it for grant-
ed that the president and the Con-
gress share the power.”

b”But even today,” Byrd said,
”we must check and balance
each other. From our experience,
we know that when one branch

, of the government gets too much

power, we lose control of our
democracy. Usually, America has
gotten hurt as a result.”

House Speaker Jim Wright, D-
Texas, urged the audience to
”resolve that we shall expand the
reach of liberty and justice in our
own time to embrace those
Americans now denied the reali-
ty of its promise.

”Let us resolve,” he said, ”to
preserve its benefits intact for fu-
ture generations and to honor its
spirit in our lives by truly respect-
ing and protecting the rights of
those even with ‘ whom we
disagree.”

The first speaker, Education
Secretary William Bennett, told
the crowd, ”The Constitution is
a double—edged sword. It is our
protection, but we are also its
protectors.

”Two hundred years after its
ratification  the Constitution re-
mains uniquely worthy of our al-
legiance,” Bennett A added.
”Happy birthday, Constitution.”

This past-Tuesday evening, the
Delta Sigma Phi brothers and
their friends gathered ‘to watch
the TV special AIDS Awareness
Test.

I At about 4:30 Tuesday after-
noon, KDKA contacted Delta Sig-
ma Phi and asked if the brothers
would like to participate in the
test, and if they would also give
their reactions to the program for
the 11 pm. news.

"The two—hour, prime—time,

commercial-free, special (aired

on KDKA and sponsored by the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Com-
pany) offered viewers the straight-
foward and sometimes explicit
facts about AIDS as well as
providing its viewers with a
55—question test.

“KDKA was interested to see
what college students’ reactions
about the program would be, and
also to find out how much col-
lege students .knew about AIDS,”
Delta Sigma brother Eric Phillips
said.

Phillips said a reporter and a
cameraman from KDKA observed

and interviewed the students} at I

the Delta Sigma Phi house
throughout the first half of the
program.

”Most of us knew the answers
to the questions about how to get

AIDS and how to prevent it, but.

most of us did not know the an-
swers to the questions concern-
ing statistics about the disease,”
Phillips said. _‘
Overall, the program was a
very educational device. ”After

\

watching the program_T=uesd,ayl,"_-
night,.we became more a'ware‘_Of.'
the epidemic our country faces;--.,.
and found out every possible way; .
of preventing AIDS from spread-f» I

The concern over the dead-
ly disease AIDS has been over-
whelming‘. But AIDS is only
one of the three main sexual-
ly transmitted diseases report-
ed in the country. _

According to statistics from
the Allegheny Department of
Health, 39 cases of AIDS were
diagnosed and confirmed in
Allegheny County for 1985.
So far this year, 30 cases have
been identified. .

But gonorrhea accounted for
3,375 cases in 1986, --even
though the figure is‘down 14
percent from 1985 that was
3,920. According to Guiller-

'.~; ».

-the. he

Ith , departm.ént.,i_

   

mo Cole, information‘ officer at ’

”Gonorrhea is the most com-
mon STD in the country. Sixty-
two percent of the cases are
sexually promiscious persons-
unde: the age of 25.”
Early"-infectious . syphilis
cases numbered 107 in I986,
‘a sharp increase over 1985's
45. ”This is the highest num-
ber of cases in the county
since 1975;” said Cole. ”This
county still has one of the na-
tion's lowest case rates of
syphilis.” '
Recently the American Pub-
lic Health Association released
information -con_cerning this
upward trend. After a five-year
decline, reported cases of
syphilis rose 23 percent."
The Health Dept. runs an
STD clinic in Oakland that

Other forms of 5 TDs persist 

while AIDS cases still rise 

agnosis and treatment, as well '
as follow-up and counseling.-

Another service is free“ 1
screening for AIDS infection 
for people in high risk groups. _ «
These groups - include
homosexual and bisexual. in-_‘
dividuals, intravenous drug
users and promiscious heter-
osexuals. _ '

All testing and counseling is
done free of charge. No ap-
pointment is necessary for A,
STD testing but is necessary
for the AIDS screening. .

The counseling includes Q
teaching patients to engage in, .
”safe sex.” All _drug users are

clinics to ‘break their addiction. A .
”Education is our main tool_._ ‘

Shultz reportsprogress in arms control talks  



WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George P. Shultz Wednes-
day reported ”some progress" on
nuclear arms control issues as he
renewed pre-summit talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Edvard A.
Shevardnadze.

The headway, Shultz said, had
been reached by a group of U.S.
and Soviet negotiators and
weapons experts who met for
three hours Tuesday night, and
also by a separate group that
dealt with bilateral questions.

He'did not provide any details
in a brief exchange with report-
ers after meeting for more than an
hour with Shevardnadze at the
State Department. -

They then dined over pheasant
in a glittering ballroom at the
Soviet embassy, a few blocks

: , from the White House, and pre-

pared to turn their attention to Af-
ghanistan and other regional
issues later in the afternoon.

Shultz is trying to persuade
Shevardnadze to agree to a with-
drawal of 115,000 Soviet troops
from the country over a few
months’ time.

Despite initially downbeat U.S.
forecasts, the two sides have
made muted claims of progress
ever since the foreign minister be-
gan his talks Tuesday.

Asked what he thought of the
optimistic statements now com-
ing from U.S. officials, Shevard-
nadze hesitated and then replied,
through a Russian interpreter,
”We also made some optimistic
statements.”

As for the two working groups
that met at the State Department
while Shultz and Shevardnadze
took a boat ride along the
Potomac River, Shevardnadze
said that ”if we didn't expect any-

-thing, we wouldn't be sitting

here.”

Shultz then volunteered, ”They
made some progress, but the
minister and I agreed while they

weren't perfect, they were the.
"best we had.”

He could not be asked for
clarification because the handful
of reporters and photographers
who were allowed a few minutes
in the eighth floor conference
room were ushered out by State

Pope calls for changes

as he meets teenagers -

LOS ANGELES —- Pope John
Paul II, grandfatherly and at times
tearful as he met with young peo-
ple in the world's entertainment
capital, urged them to cling to ”a
responsible moral life” even if it
means ”being out of step with
majority opinion.”

Later, he told leaders of the
communications industry that
they should reject pornography,
greed and violence, and ”respect
what is human and recognize
what is good.”

His first day in the nation's lar-
gest Roman Catholic archdiocese

ended with a full house for Mass _

at the cavernous_ Memorial
Coliseum. ‘
The Bishop of Rome was given

'€‘Ija(1 r '7 I

a rock star's welcome at Univer-
sal Studios Amphitheatre, where
he addressed 6,000 young
Catholics .and as many more
watching by satellite from St.
Louis, Denver and Portland, Ore.

The pontiff, who appeared
more relaxed than at any earlier
time on the tour, urged young
people to have hope, and to find
that hope in God.

Europe's Gulf plans
involve many ships

MANAMA, Bahrain — Mine
sweeping operations by Ameri-
ca’s European allies gained
momentum Wednesday, with an
Italian task force setting out for
the Persian Gulf and four British
minehunters assembling in the
Gulf of Oman to join French
warships.

Three frigates and a supply ship
sailed from Taranto in southern
Italy for the gulf, to be followed
later Wednesday by three mine
sweepers and a rescue ship from
Augusta, Sicily.

Commercial banks hit
by very large losses

WASHINGTON —— The na-
tion's commerical banks suffered
their worst quarter in more than
half a century after writing off bil-
lions of dollars in Third World
loans as uncollectible, the
government said Wednesday

The 13,937 banks insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. added $21.2 billion to
reserves for bad loans in the se-

cond quarter of 1987, causing a .

$10.6 billion loss, the first report-
ed since the Depression.

”It was clearly the worst quart-
er in. the history of the industry

‘since the FDIC began operating

in 1934,” FDIC Chairman L. Wil-

liam Seidman said.

Shaking hands

with an old friend

Two hundred years ago, a group of 55 men met and tried

‘ to make their corner of the world a better place in which to live.

Over the course of those 200 years, the document they draft-
ed, the Constitution, has endured the tests of a civil war, two
world wars, slavery and Richard Nixon. It has shown that when
room is left for modification, when it is understood that status
quo debilitates, a vast array of people can live together in rela-

~_ tive harmony.

True, the path of the United States through history has not
always been glorious, often littered with the broken souls of

' the oppressed. At times, the Constitution itself has been a tool

for oppression. But, even in light of the trials to which it has

been subjected, it has changed with us, lending support when »

the winds of change blew too cold.

‘At times, the Constitution has provided a refuge for the guilty,
hiding behind its protective clauses. Those times, though, are
certainly outnumbered by the cases of the innocent it has liber-
ated. It is not perfect, not at its inception, or even now, though
it is always open to amendment, always open to growth.

The Constitution has served as our collective memory, our
conscience. It, in its amendments, reflects the largest of the so-
cial upheavals to which Americans have been witness. Some-
times, the amendments have merely been a restating of the

Preamble, that ”We the people” will establish justice, that we _

are all entitled to the protection of our freedoms.

It is a document that allows us to live and to think in the man-
ner we find most comfortable. It shields us from any who claim
to have some right to the content of our minds. t

Perhaps the most important aspect of the Constitution is just
that. It has, by placing mini_mal restrictions on our actions, per-
mitted us the most fundamental freedom to all, the freedom

t to think, and to criticize.

We have the freedom to choose the things we will believe,
and freedom from the ifnposition of another’s belief. That’s‘what
”We the people” means. Not one voice, but the room for each
.-voice. It is that freedom we should defend for each other, this
freedom to be ourselves.

Press and ran across a recently
published article by Bob Batz Jr.,
for which the headline asked:
”Why are we working longer
hours?”

Being one who works late into
the night to satisfy some strange
compulsion to fit everything I
love into. my life, I was curious
enough tdinvest a few moments.
The return was disappointing.

Not since the heyday of the
great steel barons have people so
punished themselves for their
daily bread. These days,
however, the pressure often goes
far beyond providing the daily
bread, straight into BMW and
Jacuzzi-land. Could you survive
without a two-car garage? ”Not
on your life,” says Mr. Yuppie. ”I
must work.” -

And work he does. Endlessly.
Based on interviews with a host
of work-crazed adults, Mr. Batz
drew this conclusion. Most peo-
ple work long hours because they

‘enjoy their work. To that, I offer

a respectful ”baloney.”

First of all, what people of
sound minds would allow them-
selves to be quoted in a
newspaper article saying they
hate the fact that they spend most
of their young lives at the office?
It really irks me that an article like
this, which is at best a superficial
treatment of a noteworthy nation-
al malady, would even indirect-
ly assert that this type of
work-aholic behaviorvis proper.

Perhaps Mr. Batz, like many of
his interview subjects, didn’t_
want to appear in opposition to
the hallowed American work
ethic, the principle that has
driven as many Americans to
their graves as it has to their twin
houses. Your guess is as good as
mine. ’

I'll agree that working long
hours isn't necessarily harmful.
But let's be serious. Having
worked in corporate environs
myself, I'll tell you this. If it was
possible to guarantee no employ-
er reprisals, and if all workers
were required to do so, many
workers I know would be just as
happy to bag the office at the nor-

mal quitting time in favor of toss-
ing down a few beers or throwing

a Frisbee. But for many, thoughts

of colleagues working long hours
are enough to prompt them to do
so as well. '

It's a vicious cycle. But how do
you compete with someone who
is crazy enough to gamble every-
thing on his job? It is difficult, but
those who are able to do so are,
to me, the ones who retain their
sanity. The trouble is, many
young employees get tangled up
in the very myth that Mr. Batz
perpetuates with his article. The
people Mr. Batz spoke to and of,
for the most ‘part, aren't motivat-
ed by the desire to do good work
and/or produce a superior pro-

duct. In my opinion, they are’

motivated by deeper things, like
avarice, ego_, insecurity and fear.

In the past few decades, be-
cause of' advanced ' technology
and the shift toward a service
economy, the nature of..jobs in
general has changed. When you
are in a service business, you
must accomodate your clients,
regardless of the time factor. And
since more and more of us work
at physically easier and cleaner
desk-type jobs, the distinction be-
tween work and play has, over
time, become blurred.

When our forefathers went to
the mills and factories, they
punched in and punched out. It
was clear cut. It may have been
necessary to break a sweat dur-

ing their shifts, but when the -

whistle blew, there was no mis-

 

take — it was Miller time.
What bothers me ‘most about
an article like the one written by
Mr. Batz is its lack of balance.
Granted, The Pittsburgh Press

4 may have a policy that restricts or

bans the use on anonymous
quotes, but Mr. Batz only hints at
the possibility that other types of
people might be out there. It is
possible that his ”facts” had been
skewed by human nature — the
will, if not to please, at least not
to upset the boss. .

He barely acknowledges the
fact that there might be some-
thing festering beneath the sur-
face of this issue that, for some
reason, refuses to let itself surface.
He sticks to the facts as he knows
them and, consequently, his arti-
cle lacks insight.

' I think most people spend a lot
of time in their offices for a lot of
reasons — some good, somenot
so good. They may be incompe-
tent or inefficient and therefore
must burn the midnight oil to
keep up with the next guy. They
may be insecure, approval-
seeking-type people who need to
appear more productive than the
next guy just to retain a comfort-
able sense of superiority. Others
may feel that their jobs are in
jeopardy lest they exert superhu-
man effort. And some may beex-
tremely ambitious, which isn't
bad, as long as it doesn't go too
far. '

This is all not to discount the
notion that some people work
late hours because they like their
work. I like what I do and have

’ been known to spend quite a lot

of time doing it. But still, there
comes a time when you must
rea|ize'you’re no longer doing
yourself or your career a favor by
forcing your nose to the
grindstone.

But for me, the irony is that I'm
sitting here, long after work
hours, hammering away at my
computer keys just to tell you
this. So, you see, I'm no saint. I
admit it. But I am finished now
and, trust me, it is indeed Miller
time. '

We all need to be loved; we all need to love

  

  MAR:
nucl-IIN

Compulsively thinking about

i ‘someone? Daydreaming in class?

Drawing valentines on your note-

_ book? Well, don't panic, it's only

temporary.

Like a bad virus, infatuation
quickly spreads through us at the
momentiwe are infected by
someone’s face. Within hourswe
are transformed into bashfull,

-clumsy, lovesick, puberty-
stricken teens.

In response to Frances Sansig’s
"Review of John Paul and the
church—rockers” Sept. 14. I have
to say that it_was a very.poor
tongue—in—cheek effort on the
author's behalf. I'm a somewhat

‘fallen’ Catholic, but I still don't '

see the humor in poking fun at
Pope John Paul |I’s U.S. visitf

As a world church leader, he is
here to remind us of peace, love
and morality —— things which are
falling rapidly by the wayside in
our world. His visit is like a
’’booster shot” to remind us that
-there can be some good in the
world. '

So, instead of joking about his
popemobile or suggesting that he

‘ grace the cover of Rolling Stone,

why don't you save yourself a
good case of writer's cramp,

Frances, and instead listen to his '

message of peace and hope.
Maybe, then, you'll find some-
thing positive in the world
around you and be able to write
about it without bitter sarcasm.

What a lame review of the‘
pope's visit in Monday's The Pitt
News. What could have been an
insightful, albeit cynical, com-
mentary on the pope's exploita-
tion of the media, instead was an
illustration of the author's skillful
mastery of the obvious.

It would be ludicrous to think
that the pope's trip to the U.S.
would generate any less hype in
a culture that joined Hands
Across America and proclaimed
Oliver North a new American
hero.

Likewise, it was pointless and
unprofessional to criticize a
world religious and political lead-
er using quotations out of context

Why? Not even our present

scientists, psychologists, or the -

Moral Majority can figure out the
condition that we so innocently
have termed‘ a "crush/’

Whether we're looking for

. Prince Charming or Vanna

White, everyone has an idea of
the perfect lover. We buy posters,
watch TV, movies, read books —
all to get a certain image of who

the ideal companion is. And then-

we search to bring our imagined
creation to life. ‘

Twenty-four hours a day, peo-
ple patiently wait for their fanta-
sies to arrive. It can happen to
you at any moment. All it takes
is for someone you've never seen
to simply walk into your view. If
the person generally fits your
physical qualifications, you un-
leash your fantasies. It's not long
before this person becomes flaw-
less, and you tell yourself that fate
is calling.-

’ For the next couple weeks, 85
percent of your conversations
will involve this person; you'll
speak to your best friend, your

and slander to compare him to
the cartoon characters who in-
habit the -pages of National En-
quirer (Michael Jackson? Elvis?
Liz Taylor?) '

Was it supposed to be funny?
It might have been, » had the
author written that playing a
recording of one of the pope's
speeches backwards reveals
Spuds MacKenzie crooning La
Bamba. But to criticize the "tren-
dy little bullet-proof, transparent
dome” on the pope's car is just
warped. Someone tried to assas-
sinate him a few years back,
remember? Such unimaginative,
sensationalist trash as this article
does not belong on a university
pape_r’s editorial page; it belongs
on Entertainment Tonight.

Frances Sansig’s ”A review of
John Paul and the church-
rockers” concerned me. I am not
shocked that the news editor of
The Pitt News would display
such areckless disregard for the
religious and intellectual sensibil-
ities of her readership. I am dis-
appointed that such vitriolic
pseudo-ironic editorials such as it

"can still pass for penses de la vie

at a major university publication.

What was truly ironic was its
placement above Jeff Sewa|d’s
touching expression of bewilder-
ment with the world, "Suicide
touches a raw nerve." One of the
problems with the world, Jeff, is
that the majority of us have suc-
cumbed to the mind-numbing
rhythm of Western culture's
”dance of death" ‘ instead .of
resolving to sacrifice and dissect
the dancer in hope of the future.

Does Ms. Sansig really believe
that the shallow -and empty na-

mother, your shrink, telling each
of them that you think you're in
love.

So what do you do? Absolute-,

ly nothing. Why should you?
You've probably never felt so
romantic before in your life. Why
spoil it?

The quickest way to destroy the

perfect person is to talk to them.
What if they say something that
turns you off? What if they're an
idiot? Then you would have to
chuck your expectations and wait

for someone else. If you just tell

yourself that you're a shy, sensi-
tive person then you won't have
to go through the trauma of an in-
troduction.

Everyone admires ‘and is ad-
mired. lt’s natural. We discuss
people every day — who looks
good, who gained weight, who
slept with who. We enjoy it. Ad-
miring people is a constant
function.

An infatuation can be created
within minutes, end within days,
and be recreated the following
Saturday night.

Review of the pope's visit

LETTERS

tUl’€ Of modern American CUltUl'€

' gives us the license to begin and

end all with ourselves? Are we fi-
nally so intellectually apathetic
that the only icons we can relate
to are pop music stars?

Even for non-Catholics, such as
myself, it is possible to appreci-
ate the symbolic value of a reli-
gious figurehead such as the
pope. All movements, whether
artistic, philosophical or political,
have such figureheads. Does
drawing rhetorical mustaches on
these people bring us closer to
enlightenment? Or does it simply
draw our attention away from the
important issues — what lies be-
hind these symbols — ideologies?
In the midst of a cultural
wasteland, we, as students, need
to fight the temptation to replace
truth—seeking with irreverence as

the proper intellectual attitude»

and strive to save what remains.

It is..our duty as educated in-
dividuals to discern from these
ideologies truth and non-truth.
We must create and foster an in-
tellectual atmosphere that makes
this process of research and de-
bate possible.

Ms. Sansig took the path of
least resistance by writing her
piece in such a manner. Vandals
spraypaint graffiti on bathroom
walls. Thinkers pose reasoned
criticisms and defenses of impor-
tant ideas. I do not object to her

distaste for the pope. I am con-

cerned that her lazy method of
expressing it may be perpetuated
by her example.

I hope this newspaper will be-
come the forum it was meant to
be. Otherwise, it's going to be a
long year.

Robert P. Szyklinski

Everyone needs to love as
much as they need to be loved.
Our fantasies provide us with a
guide. '

In reality, ’‘love at first sight”
barely exists. It would be a fairy-
tale if everyone lived their lives
with the one person who fullfilled
all their dreams

Some cultures realize this fact.
They arrange marriages for their
children. After about 10 years of
living together, a husband and
wife learn to compromisewhat
they want and expect. It works.
Very few arranged couples get
divorced.

In our society we play love by
the rules. We date, have sex, live
together and get married. Its sim-
ple, anyone can do it.

The scariest thought in my
head is that my future wife is
somewhere having lunch, and
the girl I'm going to fall in love
with is on the beach with her
boyfiend. Some people believe
that for everyone, there is a per-
fect match. Yet, even with The

Dating Game and Love Connec-
tion the odds of the perfect pair
getting together are astronomical.
Even if two destined people hap-

pened to be in the same class, -

what then? Chances are they'll be
so infatuated they won't even
speak to one another. J

Most people remember their
first sweetheart but how many
remember their first infatuation.
With" practically everything, the

first time is always the most in- J

tense. When we‘ first discover
what it's like to be infatuated, we
learn the ancient rule ”you can't
always get what you want.” It's
a painful lesson that we live with
throughout our lives. Is it any
wonder that many of us seem to

only date those who resemble _ ,;
. our first crush. I

At least there are millions of
people in the world. Everyone is
bound to find someone.

In the meantime, we will have
to be content with a daydream.

Better teaching:________

Robert Glew, ‘writing in the

_ Sept. 3 ”Letters," wonders why

tuition has increased so much
faster than the cost of living,
while faculty salaries have hard-
ly kept pace with it. Further, he
muses that the increased costs
probably have not produced
commensurate increases in the
quality of education.

The question has been raised
many times, with many answers
proposed. Glew resorts to
familiar whipping boys (a bloat-
ed administration and expensive
research), and while these may
contribute to increased costs, I
suspect that administrative costs
at Pitt are on par with those found
in many businesses. Research is
indeed expensive (especially
medical research)_, but those
grants do provide a very large
part of the university's income.

I have heard only one explana-
tion for escalating tuition costs
that makes much sense. Of all the
industries in this country," teach-
ing is one of those that has seen
nearly a zero increase in the past
25 years. Productivity in this bus-
iness -is determined‘ by the stu-
dent/teacher ratio, and I doubt
that it has changed much at all in
that time period. -

Classes today are no larger than
when I came to Pitt 20 years ago,
and I continue to spend an aver-
age of three hours of preparation
for each hour spent in the
classroom.

Instead of comparing tuition
costs to the general cost of living,
we should‘ compare it instead to
the prices ofother products that

-are still turned out by the tech-

niques of a century ago. Paintings
turned out by top-quality artists,
perhaps, or completely hand-
made furniture might provide

suitable comparisons. Personally,

I can't afford either one, and my —

worry is that a college education
will soon enter that same class of
unaffordables for folks with mid-
dle incomes.

If this analyis is correct, then
we are all in deep trouble. The
cost of education will inexorably

climb compared to all other -.

costs, until only the elite can af-

ford it. What must be done to pre- _

vent this?

Again, the answer seems obvi-f I, 
ous butdistasteful.~The only way _ .
out is to dramatically"increasethe

student/teacher ratio. Can this be

done without decreasing’ the,

quality of education?

Finding an answer to this ques-
tion is crucial, and we should be

experimenting with a wide vari-.

ety of possible means for increas-
ing faculty teaching productivity.
The University External Studies
Program has shown one way‘in,

which this goal might be met, but , ._ l P

the dropout rate for students in

this program is almost unaccept- , 

ably high. Experimentation with

videotaped lectures, "computer-_  W‘

interfaced video disks, education-
al software, student study groups

and anything else that removes a - A '

professor from the time-
consuming and repetitious black-
board lecture situation and places
him or her in a role of guiding
and molding the students’ learn-
ing, is to be encouraged. Strong
input fromstudents will be neces-
sary throughout the process of de-
veloping new ways of teaching.

But if we wa_nt quality educa-
tion in sufficient quantity to con-
tinue to be a nation of educated
people, we had better get on with
the job and find more efficient
ways of doing it.

The Constitution:lnterpreta tion versus doctrine

It seems ironic that on the
200th anniversary of the Consti-
tution, some people question
whether it is a valid document for
the American government.

Many people believe that they
offer impressive opinions as to
why they disagree with our
founding fathers’ achievements.

But is the wording of the‘Con—
stitution (oftentimes vague) a
form of strength or weakness in
the administration of U.S.
democratic operations? Was this
wording purposely chosen by the
founding fathers as a means to
protect their own interests? Or
was it to allow flexibility in future
generations’ pursuits to better the
welfare of the country?

in other words, many students
question whether the Constitu-
tion is an economic doctrine, or
rather, an abstract piece of legis-
lation to protect liberty and
justice.

I posed these questions to some
Pitt students.

Joy Nagel, a sophomore politi-
cal science major, said, ’fThe Ar-

Why Be A

Quakers are chronic do-
gooders. The government
adopted our scheme for prison
education 100 years after it was
started as Quaker volunteer
work. There was a Quaker
plan for state endowed medi-
cine 250 years before Medicare.
Quakers worked to abolish
slavery 175 years before Aboli-
tion. And the checker—board
pattern of American cities was
originally based on Quaker
town planning, on the principle
of equal shares of daylight for
all.

What started all this?
William Penn said, 'True Cod-

liness does not turn men out of
the world, but enables them to
live better in it, and excites
their endeavor to mend it."
Friends are not apologetic
about being do-gooders. They
don't feel that they have to
"justify" helping others in need,
working f_or a just and fair. soci-
ety, or endeavoring to bring
about peace in the world. "Do-
gooding" is serving that of God
in every human. It is a way of

life.

Do you, too, suspect that doing"
good is not so bad? If so, per-
haps the beliefs of the Friends

icles of the Confederation were
not getting the support of the peo-
ple. The fact that the ratification
of the Constitution suppressed
this [economic] discontent
eliminates the belief that it was
designed -to enhance the eco-
nomic growth of a few
[delegates].”

Dave Calabrese, junior nuclear
physics major, argued, ”They
were landowners — wealthy
landowners — who were defi-
nitely looking out for their own
interests.

”However, you cannot forget

that they were the only ones will-

ing to undertake such a task. I feel
that with all factors weighed, they
did a great job.”

The fact that Calabrese feels
”they did a pretty good job,” and
at the same time believes that our
founding fathers had economic

interests in mind, introduces
another aspect. is it possible that
an appeal for the preservation of
liberty and justice is simply an ap-
peal to man's economic instincts?
 

A MARC
WALLACE

On the Constitution

’’It depends on what school of
thought you're stemming from,”
said Nancy Fisher, junior politi-
cal science and economics
major. ”lf you have an
economist’s point of view, ob-
taining personal liberties in es-
sence implies obtaining
economic gains. But if.you have
a political viewpoint, obtaining
personl liberties does not neces-
sarily mean obtaining economic

gains.”

Many students say that the
mystery and vagueness of the
Constitution is one of its beauties.
Surprisingly, with the questiona-
ble nature ofjudge Robert Bork’s
interpretations at its pinnacle, the
students I talked to said the Con-
stitution doesn't need to be re-
vised to limit personal
interpretation.

Sean Leonard, a junior in CA5,
said, ”Offering personal interpre-
tation is the way it was designed
to be — and should be — so that
the interpretations can change

with societal changes. However, _

letting personal views coincide
with interpretations that are sup-
posed to enhance the people's
liberties many times leads to con-
flict  judicial restraint is of most
importance.” -

Third—year pharmacy student

John Shurina said," ”No matter.

how you revise or review it,

knuckleheads like Bork will al—' F
ways find a way to make it coin- ’ ’

cide with their interests.”

What, then, do students feel to
be the most important aspect of
the Constitution?,lt is obvious stu-
dents agree that the basic per-
sonal freedoms are most
important. ”After all,” pointed
out Joy Nagel, ”it is these free-
doms that support and exempli-
fy democracy.”

Or perhaps many of you can
relate to John Shurina, who said,
”The most important aspect is the
freedom to do whatever the hell
you want behind closed doors
without worrying that your pic-

ture will be published in some sli-

my newspaper or your [urine]
will be filtered through a funnel
for testing.”

Staff Writer

Late last spring, Hector in
Paris decided to ditch their
drum machine and feature real
people playing real in-
truments.

It's gotten them all the way
to MTV.

The local artists enjoyed na-

’ tional exposure Sunday night,
when their video was featured
on MTV’s new music show,
720 Minutes. '

”They didn't show the
whole thing, as we don't have
national distribution yet,” said
Hector’s singer/guitarist Philip
Harris. ”We only found out a
couple of days before it went
on the airthat it was going to
be on.”

P A R I  
Getting a glimpse of MTV

The video is a performance
of ”High Life,” off the band's’
second single released on
Mom's Old-Fashioned
Records. Hector in Paris re-
cently came out with a newly
recorded cassette, No Leaning,
and plans to make an album
as soon as possible.

MTV VJ ‘Mark Goodman
hosts 720 Minutes and gave
Hector a plug by saying the
band now needs national dis-
tribution.

”We sent them the video,
and they loved it,” Harris said.

Directed by Rich Noel and
produced by Wayne Boswell,
the video splices cuts of the
band playing in the strip dis-
trict with shots of people
dancing.

Hector in Paris plays two
shows Saturday night at Graffi-
ti with North By Northwest.

at 7 p.m. and an over-21 show
at 10 pm.‘

And you'll see a new drum-
mer and bass player when
Hector hits the stage.

”Our drum machine was
really limiting,” Harris said.
”Having a new drummer and
bass player gives us a lot more
dynamics. You're not playing
with a drum machine; you're
playing with a human being.”

For The Pitt News

Bones hung from branches, a
dead animal strung to the wall,
ruffled feathers from charred
birds connected to pulleys  sor-
ry kids, but these aren't film clips
from the latest horror film. No,
these are real — and right here in
our neighborhood.

I'm talking about the present
exhibition at the UP Gallery,
”Half-Life.” It is a striking visual
and sometimes unsettling show.
The show features over 20
pieces, collaborative efforts by
Daniel Burke and Shelle. Lichten-
walter Barron.

Colleagues at Mercyhurst, they
have known each other for a
dozen years. After a two—man
slide show, where each ran his
own projector, they became in-
terested in the idea of putting a
show together featuring pieces
they both worked on-.

”The purpose of working
together was to form another per-
son; a third person to create the
art,” said Burke. ”We would
work on four or five pieces at a
time, and when we had too many
of our own marks on the canvas
we would switch.”

The difficulty in working
together was that they had to
”destroy to gain,” that is, consult
with each other and then‘ agree
on the changes. On some of the
works there are drawings under
drawings under the f_inal layer.

”We would review things at
the end of a day; we tried to let
the work speak to us," to tell us
what it needed,” said Burke.

The stuff is big, has strong con-
trasts and incorporates a variety
of materials which could very

£1;ggggmsmwiasfxcrsrmxmraasvsxataaet

well be from the family garage.
Pulleys, screws and wood along
with bones, feathers, branches
and twine are a few of the items
used.

Animal images repeatedly
show up in the paintings and
drawings. Rats, birds and the sug-
gestion of small animals and their
body parts are in the paintings
and constructed on the canvases.
They got many of their ideas from
looking through biology dissec-
tion manuals.

On the later works, things be-
gin to actually come off the sur-
face, constructions projecting
into space to become more real.

”lt’s about searching for some-

and throwing them away to find

With a questioning attitude and
unsure of what would result,
Burke said they were very sur-
prised at how some pieces turned

Benedum

Center

brings. in Broadway

By Peter Mattiace
Associated Press Writer

An aging 1920s downtown
movie theater will be reborn this
week as the 2,800-seat Benedum
Center for the Performing Arts, a
sparkling, state-of-the-a'rt home
for opera, ballet, modern dance
and Broadway shows boasting
the nation's third-largest stage.

The restored Stanley Theatre is
just one block from Heinz‘ Hall
for the Performing Arts, another
former movie house reopened in
1971 as the home of the Pitts-
burgh Symphony. Officials hope
the two theaters will form the
nucleus of a ”downtown cultur-
al district.”

The $42 million Benedum
Center is the new home of the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, the

Pittsburgh Opera, the Civic Light A

Opera and the Pittsburgh Dance
Council, all of which shared the
2,843-seat Heinz Hall with the
Pittsburgh Symphony.

Carol R. -Brown, president of
the Pittsburgh Trust for Cultural
Resources, which directed the
renovation of the new theater,
predicted it will attract at least
twice as many people and 50 per-
cent more cultural events
downtown. .

She insisted it will not pit theat-
er against theater for such travel-
ing Broadway shows as ”My One
and Only," which recently set a
two-week gross receipts record at
Heinz Hall, and ”Cats,” which is
scheduled for late November at
the Benedum Center.

”We will share information on
bookings and will work in a com-
plementary fashion,” Mrs. Brown
promised.

”That’s the intent of both
halls,” said Sylvia Turner, spokes-
woman for the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Society, which owns
Heinz Hall. ”They keep pitting
both halls against each other. The
challenge will be to sell tickets to
both events, to support these two
halls. It's expanding our cultural
horizons. It's lightening the load
for Heinz Hall.”

But, she noted the symphony
faces a $1 million deficit next sea-
son in lost rentals for Heinz Hall
and lost fees paid to symphony
musicians by the four performing
groups.

”Our challenge here is to make
up the deficit in other ways,”
Turner said.

The Benedum Center has ‘re-
stored the ' Stanley's 1928
elegance with a gilded interior,
domed ceiling with rebuilt
500,000-piece crystal chandelier
and ornate wooden stage arch, all
in deep brown, gold, silver and
burgundy. A restored theater mar-
quee hangs on Seventh Street.

With the completion of the
restoration, the building will be
placed on the National Register
of Historic Places as an example

"of the grand movie palaces of the

'20s, 1 said Benedum" manager

”The United States is woefully

. behind in building fine theaters,”
said architect Albert Filoni of-

Pittsburgh, who supervised the
restoration. ”How did we get

stuck with this high school stage-‘ .7

size syndrome?” V
An addition added nine stories

in height and 62 feet in depth to 

the back of the Stanley Theatre to

create a stage measuring 86 feet; if

by 144 feet, third in size to the

Metropolitan Opera in New York _ "W

and the Indiana University

School of Music in Bloomington, , 

lnd., according to Filoni.

The backstage addition also 
houses two full-size rehearsal
rooms, 21 dressing rooms for up 
to 270 people, offices, and set 
storage for three full productions,

according to Filoni.

"We now have the ability to‘._"_

bring in uncompromised stage

productions,” Filoni said. ”They 

[the audience] are going to see‘

the difference the day the curtain 

goes up.”

The curtain rises Friday on a_; 
four-day musical ”festival” that
includes an array of local per- I_
formers and Lionel Hampton,'..:
Rosemary Clooney and George.

Benson. Luciano Pavarotti and
the Pittsburgh Opera will play in
the theater in early October.

The theater's restoration was, )-
financed by governmental and
foundation contributions, include 1»
ing a $17 million federal Urban, 
Development Action Grant and a 
$13.3 million donation from the 

Claude Worthington Benedum

Foundation, a philanthropy setup ‘

by the late Michaeland Sarah

Benedum, West Virginia oil and :2

gas magnates.

The federal grant also was tied 
to the 32-story, $117 million
CNG Tower, an office building 2::

under construction between the
two playhouses.

The Benedum Center's owner 3

has an option to buy the nearby

1,500-seat Fulton Theatre, the last» ‘Ll
movie theater in downtown Pitts-1..
burgh, which shows foreign and 

avant-garde films.

The eight-story Stanley Theat- 
er, a 3,500-seat movie house‘ 

built for $3 million,

described by the press as a ”thes- C
pian fairyland” in 1928. It was I; -.

one of more than 200 movie'-

theaters built by the Stanley Co. ' 
and offered customers a',movie«~3=

_and a stage show for 65cents.

cluding Ronald Reagan, played 1

the theater in the 19305 and

19405. A flood damaged paint-H...
ings and fanciful plaster designs, 

when water rose to within two

‘feet of the balcony in 1936.
From 1977 to its closing for

renovation in 1984, the theater

was used for rock ’n’ roll con- 
certs, including the Beach Boys, . .

The best films ever made are on sale at  Fulton ,

This weekend, the Fulton

Theater will be a good neighbor.

The downtown cinema is joining
in the grand celebration for the

' opening of Benedum Center for

the Performing Arts. Both places
share a block of Sixth Street in
town, and the Fulton will wel-
come the cultural center, former-

ly the Stanley Theatre, by.-

some of the best films in movie
history.

Hospitality abounds when the
Fulton rolls back the price of ad-
mission for this weekend's films
to the amount charged when the
particular film premiered. The
features include science fiction,
comedy,romance and drama.

The films will be augmented
with special cartoons, newsreels
and short films from the 1930s

Laugh4n

type show’  

renewed  

By Jerry Buck

Associated Press Writer

LOS ANGELES — Stand—up
Comedy is one of the most pre-
cise art forms and one of the most
fragile, according to producer
George Schl-atter.

Schlatter, the man who gave

birth to Laugh-In 20 years ago,

has a new syndicated series
called George Schlatter’s Come-

 dy Club. _

The show, which makes its
debut on 120 stations next week,
is a fast-paced mixture of comics
and specialty acts in the quick—cut
tradition of ”Laugh—ln.” S

”A joke is a melody,” said
Schlatter. ’’It’s got a rhythm, a lyr-
ic and a thought. You have to un-
derstand it and it requires an
audible indication of intellectual
appreciation and an acceptance

' of the thought and delivery.”

In other words, a joke must be
delivered in a precise manner
and the audience must laugh.

’-‘The stand-up comic is the
most vulnerable artist in the en-
tertainment business,” said
Schlatter. ”Nobody ever says to
a singer, "I've heard it before.’ "

Schlatter has been working
with comics since his days as a
nightclub -booker in Los Angeles
and Las Vegas. One act he
booked into the Frontier Hotel
was Ronald Reagan and the Con-
tinentals. ’’It- was his only night-
club appearance,” Schlatter said.
”He sang, he danced, he was
wonderful.”

Later, he produced such shows .

as The Dinah Shore Chevy Show,
The Andy Williams Show, The
/udy Garland Show, Laugh—In and
Real People. _ _
Schlatter is also preparing an

, ABC special saluting the 7.5th an-

niversary of Las Vegas.

The idea for the Comedy Club,
originally called Laugh Machine,
came before Schlatterfs first annu-
al American Comedy Awards on
ABC last spring. A

”There’s a whole new breed of
comics out there and they don't
have a pipeline to mainstream tel-
evision. That's one of the things
hurting network television today.
The new, exciting, innovative

_‘ thingsare nowhappening on pay

Two films are offered for only

Here, one need never ask
”Where’s the Beef?” The large
cooked-to-ordér portions are
served on French bread.

Lunchtime favorites include
economical daily specials. The
Steak Sandwich ($3.50) and
Pete's Special ($2.75) are also
quite delectable.

Pete's Special is a ground lamb
and beef patty served on pita
bread with lettuce, tomato, onion
and the house sauce.

In addition to these specialties
are the more traditional Pittburger
($2.50) and Beefburger ($1.85).

The Beefburger is a quarter-
poundsof beef served on French
bread instead of a stale hamburg-
er bun found most other places.
The Pittburger is virtually the
same thing, only bigger. It boasts
one—third of a pound of meat. Let-
tuce and tomato are free, but
cheese, sauteed mushrooms and
onions are each a quarter extra.

If you're not a fan of red meat,
order the Fish Sandwich ($2.75)
or a Pita Salad ($1.75).

To complement the list of sand-
wiches are plenty of fried foods
(mushrooms, potatoes, provolone
and such), the soup of the day,
chili, cheese pie, spinach pie as
well as salads.

Also offered are a variety of

dinners ranging from Grilled-

Shark Steak ($6.25) to De|moni—
co Steak ($5.95).

Whether ‘eating in or taking
out, Pete's Pitt/Mitchell's offers
plenty of good food at a price just
right for a college budget.

nachos.

C.J.’s serves a delicious Taco
Salad ($4.95 for beef, $5.25 for

, chicken), in addition to a tradi-

tional Chef’s Garden Salad
($4.95) and a Spinach Salad
($3.95). 7

Sandwiches at C.J.’s range from
an All—American Hot Dog ($1.85)
to a Vegetarian Pita ($3.95).
Sandwiches are served on white
or rye bread _or a Kaiser roll.
. The Mexicana section of the
menu has the most to offer. The
Burrito (around $4.50 depending
on type) is served with refried
beans and Spanish rice. The spe-
cial C>J. Burrito (which combines
the meats and_ vegetables of the
regular burrito) is truly a Mexican
treat.

C.J. Barney's is a terrific place
to go if you're not sure what taste
your palate craves. And it's a

,restaurant most students can

afford.

My Place

My Place is a nice, inexpensive
‘restaurant for lunch. Even though
-it's usually busy, if you can find
a table, the atmosphere is light
and airy — and so is the food.

Most of these stores have two
things in common. First, they do not
sell expensive state of the art com-
ponents so they rarely get to hear
the world's finest sounds. Second, the
nice people they employ, who also
sell refrigerators, lawn mowers, and
coffee pots, are not the ones trom

are not a substitute for a real

- knowledge about sound.

If there is one word to describe
fashions this fall, it's spunk. From
short skirts to high boots, from sil-

personal style in fashion makes a
personal statement.

The latest trends include just '
about everything — if it's smartly
coordinated. Long skirts that
barely show the ankles or a mini
that barely covers are both in-

ing prominence. Not just in the
workplace, but everywhere.

No longer are females hiding in
bulky jeans. There is a renewed
sense of femininity for both day-
time and nighttime apparel.

To, complement the many
different skirts are the increasing
styles of boots. This season, look
for ankle boots with long skirts,
mid-calf boots with just about
everything and thigh—high boots
with minis. Remember the '60s?

All this from the fashion capi-
tal of America — New York.

Campus styles differ — a much
more relaxed attitude character-
izes what students wear.

One of the latest crazes is to
wear ripped, faded jeans. Some
even go as far as to buy worn
jeans. Or at least acid-washed
jeans.

Tie—dyes, too, are hip. At the
Dead concert it was easy to pick
out who was a Deadhead and
who was a poseur by the type of
tie-dye they wore.

The ones on campus are.basi-
cally new, bright and machine
made. The true ones are tie-dyed
by hand.

Other styles include the all-
purpose sweatshirts and rugbys.
These can be put on in a rush and
take virtually no sense of fashion.
Needless to say, sweatshirts are
easy to match. Just add jeans and

go.

Fashion isn't a necessity but it
can be fun. If you can't afford to
be in the pop style, create your
own. Being unique is a style in it-
self and, it's cheap.

cause wasn't helped any. Junior
Todd McNair leads the rushing
attack averaging a respectable 3.9
yards per carry, but Ventres
Stevenson, the team's second
leading rusher, will miss the
game with a severely pulled ham-
string.

Shouldn’t really matter,
though, as the Pitt rushing
defense (number one in the coun-
try, 31 net yards allowed in '87)
has eaten every running back sent
its way. And the Owls, with their
lack of a true breakaway player
in the offensive backfield, will

Cougar and N.C State Wolf.
Temple's top wide receiver,

' Keith Gloster is questionable for,

the game with hamstring
problems, while the team's tight
end, All-America candidate Mike
Hinnant has been blotted out by
defenders this season, owning
only one catch. Freshman Rich
Drayton leads the team in receiv-
ing with 104 yards on six catches.

Defensively, cornerback Joe
Greenwood and safety Eddie Par-
ker are two of the best d-backs
that the Panthers will face all sea-
son. ”Greenwood is a great play-
er. He’s got enough quickness to
cover just about anybody. I'm
happy with his performance so
far this season,” remarked Arians.
Both have one interception

wood roams freshman ,Gary

Mobley, the team's fifth leading
tackler. Expect Gottfried to direct
his offensive firepower at the
youngster, looking for a few big
brakes to evolve from freshman
mistakes. ‘

The Owls linebacking corps of
Toren Schonyers, Joe Possenti
and Arturo Weldon are a quick,
physical group which has com-
bined for 40 tackles so far in
1987. Due to Arians’ conserva-
tive, anti—blitzing defensive
scheme, none have sacks.

But with the emergence of Pitt
quarterback Sal Genilla as one of
the East's top fi re—th rowers, Tem-
ple may increase its outside pres-
sure and try to hurry some of
Genilla’s throws, hoping the

corners and safeties can come up 1

Two big winners meet in game of the week I

By Vince Longo
Staff llﬁiter

The game of the week takes
place in South Bend, where re-
juvenated Notre Dame takes on
Michigan State. Both teams are
coming off huge wins (Notre
Dame over Michigan and Michi-
gan State over Southern Cal.) in
their openers, but there will be no
letdown for either the Irish or the
Spartans — Notre Dame-24
Michigan State-21.

Pitt beat Temple by an average
score of 36 to 6 between 1975
and 1983, but Temple has beat-

en the Panthers two out of three
times since then. Things are back
to normal in the East — Pitt-23
Temple-3.

In 1983, following Penn State's
first national championship, Cin-
cinnati went to Beaver Stadium
and handed the defending na-
tional champs a 14-3 loss in what
was part of a 1-3 start for the Nit-
tany Lions. This time, the~Bear-
cats have quarterback Danny
McCoin. Upset of the week —

ward came back with a list that
"included every meat, vegetable
and fruit known to man,” Gott-

fried said.

Heyward defended his hefty
build by saying the extra pounds
help him absorb the pounding he
takes by carrying 30 times a
game. Gottfried responded by

saying the Pitt offense did not in-
clude a belly series until Hey-
ward reported in less-than-ideal
shape.

”Surprisingly, for his weight, he
is built very solidly and doesn't

 

 

have much fat on him,” Gottfried
said. "But he and I have talked

about football after college, and

he knows he's going to have to
lose the weight to play in the
pros. I just wish he'd do it now.”

Freshman Seaman is happy he ch

By Eric Reuscher
For the Pitt News

When it came time for Eric Sea-
man of West Chester, Pa., to de-
cide what college he would play
football for this fall, it basically
came down to two schools —
Notre Dame and the University
of Pittsburgh.

His first visit was to South
Bend, 'Ind., and although he was
impressed with the school and fa-
cilities, he wanted to give Pitts-
burgh a try. .

A close friend had told Sea-
man, from personal experience,
what Pitt had to offer.

That source was his father, Nor-
ton, who was a two-year letter-

man at Pitt in '58 and '59.

After the younger Seaman visit-
ed the campus, he cancelled his
remaining recruiting visits. He
had found the school he wanted.

”l’ve always thought about fol-
lowing in my dad's footsteps,”
Seaman said. ”But he never pres-
sured me. I made the decision on
my own. I fell in love with Pitt on
my first visit and knew I wanted
to -go there.”

Seaman is a very promising
tight end. Norton, who played
with Mike Ditka and roommate
Serafino ”Foge” Fazio, played
three positions —— linebacker,
guard, and placekicker.

Although football is the main
reason Seaman chose Pitt over
Notre Dame and the other
schools, there were other factors.

’’I was impressed by the coach-
ing staff and players,” said Sea-
man. ’’I was also impressed with
the educational programs, poten-
tial job opportunities and the
friendly atmosphere of the city.
The city is very clean.” -

”The 6-foot-4, 235-pound Se
man arrived at Pitt one week
earlier than freshmen were re-

quired to _report. During that time
he worked closely with a gradu-
ate assistant coach John Har-
baugh learning the system and
conditioning himself for fall
camp.

His toils have paid off. Seaman
has moved up the depth chart
muchlike a new hit song moves
up the Top 40 chart. V

When camp began on Aug. 12,
he was listed fourth on the depth
chart. One week later, he found
himself at the top of the list. Sea-
man contends his rapid climb has
not been easy. And now he is
positioned directly behind David
Tanczos. -

In last week's game against
North Carolina State, Seaman
caught his first college pass with
a gain of four yards during the
third quarter.‘

”At the tight end position,
everyone has the same or similiar

abilities,” said Seaman. ”The

guys I'm competing with work
hard and are pushing me to do
my best.”

The one person any player has
to impress is ultimately the head
coach, and Panther head coach

Mike Gottfried is pleased with
Seaman's progress. . '
”He has moved into the posi-
tion because of the way the other
people have played,” Gottfried
said. He has done extremely well
in a position we need to solidify."
”.He’s a good athelete and gets

up the field well,” continued-

Gottfried. ”He runs well and

Three University of Pittsburgh
students won their respective

"classes at the Police Athletic

League/UPT Open Invitational
Martial Arts Tournament held
Sept. 13 in Donora, Pa.

In doing so, they are now able
to join the Western Pennsylvania
PAL Tae Kwon Do/Karate Team
as it travels to the national com-
petition in Columbus, Ohio.

. -\ Brad Bentz placed first in the

heavyweight sparring division
andthird in the heavyweight
open hand KATA division -
KATA being very similar to
shadow boxing. The participant
is judged on form, technique and
how smoothly they can complete
the movements.

“J ,_J,,,.,...,,_!..l.;',::..§.,.:,...... ,. ,:,-.‘._- V: .._..,~ ._i  .  . : v ~/ ,_.

Bentz, from Fox Chapel, is a
senior biology major planning on
attending veterinary school next
year. Bentz is a brown belt in his
fourth year of karate. Bentz got
started in karate as a result of an
ankle injury that occurred while
playing soccer. ’’I wanted to keep
myself in some sort of shape and
maintain my flexibility,” said
Bentz. ”So then I took up karate
as a suggestion from Brian
[VoIpe].”

Volpe placed first in middle-
weight free sparring and second
in middleweight open-hand
KATA. Volpe, from O'Hara
Township, is in his first year of
dental school and is a brown belt
in his fifth year of studying karate.

This was his first fighting event.
He commented, ”I did not like to

fight; I liked to do the exercises
and the workout but not the fight-
ing. I was talked into it by Curtis
Smith, my instructor here.”

‘ 

I wanted to keep my-
self in some sort of
shape and maintain my
flexibility  so then I
took up karate.

black belt, he has been studying

karate since he was 12 years old.

”It was partially because I came

from a rough area, and I was no.
good at baseball or most other

sports,” said Schurz.

All three are involved with the
Pitt East—West Martial Arts Club.
Volpe serves as the president and
Bentz as the vice president.
Schurz is the newest member of
the club that has 35 student
members;

The club is involved in rape

”Anyone who wants to can
come down and join the club,”
said Schurz. ”The self discipline
that is associated with martial arts
can carry over into your
schoolwork.”

All three are viewing the na-
tional tournament as a learning
experience. ”This is a national
tournament with international
rules,” said Volpe.

”We all intend to try and do
our best and not think about los-
ing,” said Bentz. Schurz added,
”If you even think about losing,
even just a little bit, your going
to get beat on pretty good.”,

”When we say that wewant to

Seaman's ultimate goal while
playing at Pitt is to w_in a nation-
al championship and someday
play professional ball. At the
same time, he realizes that more
realistic goals take precedence.

He wants to graduate with a
degree in special education and

‘continue working toward his

master's degree.

”Academics is the most impor-
tant thing in my life. Everything

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 17, 1987

  WANT TO SEEYOUR NAME IN PRINT?

 
   

 

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

Take a look at the Pitt depth chart.
Check out the players at these positions:
fullback, middle linebacker and left
tackle.

And, as your eyes are searching through
all the fraternity and sorority standards
when the Pitt Panthers run out onto the
field, look for the numbers 42, 44 and 93.

Subsequently, the names that go along
with the two sets of classifiers listed above
are Prentiss Wright, Jeff Christy and Marc
Spindler.

All of them are the starters at their
respective positions.

And they're all ‘freshmen. 1
’'I've been more than happy with-.th
way that our freshmen boys have
played,” said Pitt coach Mike Gottfried.
”They've brought something to the team
with their overall spirit and determination

to play, and that's been something which.

has helped us out immensely.”

When Gottfried announced his recruit
list last spring it was brimming with high
school stars. But, no matter how good
they looked on paper, he really had no
idea as to how they would perform in the
collegiate ranks. But because of what
some say was bad luck and what'Gott—
fried says was bad depth, he had to find
out immediately.

Somehow it seems to be working. _

"They_'ve really surprised me," said

Pl STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

 

  

Gottfried. "I've never seen so many fresh-
men come in who are so together with
themselves and the team as a whole.
They've really prox/en themselves.”
But the three starters mentioned above
are not the only frosh Gottfried has in-
filtrating his depth charts — he's got them

. scatterred all over the place. Louis Rid-

dick and Eric Holzworth are both back-
ups at free safety and weak side lineback-
er, respectively.

Marc Williams fills in at tailback behind
junior Craig Heyward and sophomore
Adam Walker, and Eric Seaman is the
second—string tight end. Meanwhile Gott-
fried says third-string quarterback Darnell
Dickerson should see some playing time
this season.

9 But what about their records? Of any
of the freshmen, SpindIer’s alone speaks
like a dream. In two‘ games this year, he
has I I tackles (four unassisted), one hur-
ry, one sack and a fumble reception. Not
bad for someone who's only I7-years old.

4 "I was really pretty nervous at first start-

.ing my first game at Brigham Young, but

after the initial fear worked itself off,..I
decided that I wanted to play some foot-

ball,” said Spindler. "I just think it's fun-.

ny that I was playing my first college
football game before I ever took my first
class!”

So’, as you're watching the Panthers bat-

~tle Temple, remember the Pitt youngsters

on the field.
The only catch is, they're with the big
boys now.
