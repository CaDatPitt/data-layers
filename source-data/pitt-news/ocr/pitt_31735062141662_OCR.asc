enough thinking.

Dean Sieg emphasized the fact that
he thought that the way of education
was not important, but that a. funda-
mental pliilosorghy which pervades
the education is absolutely necessary.

The committee of professors which
is to study the question is expected
t.o takeabout a year-for its work. It
is ma.de up of men from every ﬁeld of
learning,‘ so that, according to the
dean, no particular viewpoint may
nominate, but ideas will combine and
come together to give the ﬁnal, well
rounded philosophy.

The members of the cominittee are:
Mont. R. Gabhert, professor of philo-
sophy, chairman; Earle Fairﬁeld. pro-3
lessor of modern languages, secretary; 1
Elmer D. Graper, professor of politic-;.

in part:

“America has lost her unity, her

can they be reclaimed? Only through

U. S. Should Lead Peace

Movement, Johnson States

 

Roswell H. Johnson, p-rofessor of;
oil and gas, adopts an avowedly lib-p;
eral attitude towards disarmamenti
and the foreign policy of the United:
States, according to a statement lie‘=
gave when asked about the recent
di'sarmament controversy here at the
University.

Professor Johnson came out strong-
ly in favor of the United States tak-
ing the leadership in the ﬁght of the
world for peace. He said, “I favor an
attitude of hearty cooperation on the
part of the United States in the work
of the Conference for the Limitations
of Armaments. I think we should be
willing to limit armaments faster
tlian other nations owing to our
strategic position geographically and
our powerful position economically.
To merely say that we are willing to
go ahead as fast as other nations is
not an effective way to produce re-
sults. Vi/'e should assume leadership,
ln my opinion we should seek to make
war less common in the following ad-
ditional ways to that of limitation of
arms, for limitation alone is inade-
quate to prevent war.

1. Join the World Court.

.2. Sign the clause by which we
submit all disputes to the Vi/orld
Court,

3. Join the League of Nations as
we promised to do in the fourteenth
point of the attempt to induce Ger-
many to make peace.

4. Strengthen all our arbitration
treaties to make them full hearted
and unreserved agreements. to arbi-
trate all disputes except those that
are purely national such as immigra-
tion. ..

5. Sign a treaty that will deﬁnitely
commit ms. to consu’l.t.ation‘..over any
a.pparen.t breach of the Kellog Pact of
Paris.

6. Avoid international friction and
ill will by abandoning the restriction
of immigration on the grounds of na-
i.i.oi:,i_al._it-y ,or__.- race in favor of;,personal
relations, as soon as personal rela-
tions are put on rigorous and scien-
tiﬁc grounds, by debarring all those

_—

and those who are otherwise ﬁt.

7. The reduction of tariff walls.

8 An increase of devotion to
human loyalty over any kind of group
loyalty, including national.

9. Seek to create goodwill througli
encouraging more travel abroad, by
abolishing passport and visa fees.
Also, by our government ceasing to
act as a. business man in its foreign
relations, but rather as a courteous,
helpful gentleman.

As to speciﬁc issues, I would favor
the recognition of Russia and the
postponement of any application of
pressure on Japan in the expectation
that the Lytton report will eventually
be met in large part by the heavy
pressure of expense on the part of
Japan in Manchuria."

treme of that period would be when
a polished gentleman had been
crowned king of football coaches.

Began in 1914

I chose Pitt in 1914 and never re-
gretted it. I might have done better
._o,r worse at another school; but hav-
ing chose Pitt I have tried to give it
my unadulterated loyalty.

_campus. “Ch_alk” Williamson, “Bob”
Peck, “Cliff” Morrow, and Lea Collins
were participants in that game and
have passed on since.

The Saturday after the Cornell
game, “Tus” lVIcLa.ughery made it
tough for us to beat VVestminster at
W'ilkinsburg Ball Park. The ﬁrst
Pittite to introduce himself to this
green freshman was -Roy Kernohan,_a

“Andy” Hastings, Soppit, “Pat”
I-Ierron, “Tiny” Thornhill, Phil Dil-
lon, and Manager “Buny” Collinwood
were in that ﬁrst game in Pittsburgh
as well as being at the banquet.

As the 1914 Westminster game
marked my football debut in Pitts-
burgh, so the 1917 Westminster game
bro.ught the knowledge that my col-
legiate football career had come to
and end.

“Rock-Chalk” in 1914

Joe Duﬁ and Nubbs Harlan, assist-
ed by Floyd Rose and Alex Steven-
son, were surely coaching a tough ag-
gregation here at Pitt. Volcanic
“Chuck” Reese. reliable “Pete” Hile,
nervous “Jerry” DeHart. “Specs”
Hanley. “Dutch” Hockensmith, and
Capt. “Red” Smith were other mem-
bers of the team. Earl Ammons
scouted some for that team as well as

400 Women Enroll For WAA

lnterciass

Sports Program

 

Enrollment for the interclass ath-
letic competition undertaken by
WAA to allow all women on the cam-
pus to take an active interest in
sports now number 400 women.

The newly designed project, started
this week, will offer every sport in
which women are interested. A sport
program will take place every day in
the week, some at Trees Gym, others
at -the YM and YWHA, as well as so-
cial sports at the Heinz House one
hour each week. At the end of the
year a bronze plaque will be awarded

to the class with the most points.

Since the primary. purpose of the
interclass competition is to interest
wo_n1en re.pres_en,ting class groups to
_p-articipate in sports the physical ed-
ucation majors are separated from the
non-physical education majors to make
for more equal competition." Alice
Rosenberger, Ed. ’35, and her com-
mittee, Estelle Woods, Ed. ’33, Har-

Boxing Team May Be Without
Services oi Capt. Seigel

 

Although the football fans in and 1
around Pittsburgh are rejoicing over ,

the Panthers’ future trip to the Rose

Bowl, it is quite likely that boxing ‘

Coach Joe Orsini is in no mood to
shout “hooray for our side.”

The fact that Pitt is going to the
cost has meant two drawbacks already
to Orsini’s plans for a successful sea-
son. The ﬁrst is the matter of space.
Boxing candidates have been liolding
daily workouts on the stage at Trees
Gym, without the beneﬁt of a ring or

. “Pat” Herron, the best  suiﬁcient room in which to drill. Just

as it seemed certain that training
quarters were to be shifted to the sta-
dium, the Rcse Bowl bid necessitated
the use of all space by the varsity.
The second, and possibly the great-
est drawback lies in the fact that

Captain “Duke” Seigel may n.ot be in

condition for Pitt’s first two collegiate
meets. Unless the football team re-

turns from the coast by plane, which,
is quite unlikely, Seigel will have but‘

two weeks in which to make weight
and train for the opening match with
Temple.

The above mentioned “helps” are in--

creased by the fact that additional
material that was expected to come

; gotta go.-”

from the football squad is quite un_-
likely to appear. ‘
Coach Orsini has not been asked

‘ for any opinion on the subject as yet,

but itis quite possible that the reply
would -be, “when you gotta go, yo.u

asked? That question wasn’t a poser
for Jock———he named them off as fast
as they could be written down.

appeared on the field ready to do
battle with this array of stars—»
Donchess, who received All-Amer»

Quatse, Montgomery, Daugherty,
Getto, Skladany, and Fox. Major
Sasse would certainly have to ﬁnd

I We Get The ‘Bid’

INAL editions of the downtown papers baniiered the story last
Thursday night. “Pitt Gets Rose Bowl Bid” was the cry on
street corners throughout the city. And then a pair of frantic co-
managers set about the ta.sk of recalling for practice Dr. Sutlierland’s
squad of jubilant football men.
Pittsburgh and all "Western Pennsylvania share with the Uni-

-versity the honor which accompanies the invitation to meet the Tro-

jans of the University of Southern California at Pasadena on Janu-
ary 2. The recognition, c.ovetcd———and with good reason—by at l.east
three other schools, came to Pitt because of its superior record in
liavingbeen undefeated throughout an unusually diﬁicult schedule.

Regardless of the outcome of this last highly publicized “grid-
iron classic,” notliiiig can deny the Panthers their place in the
mythical hall of collegiate football champions. Our words of meager
praise are not alone. Other persons of ﬁner judgment in the ﬁeld of
a.tliletics already have paid their hearty tributes to “Jock” and the
squad he can refer to only as “my boys.” _

Witli virtually all the East behind them and—as one prominent
faculty member insists—with “one more good game in their system,”
the team has more than a slim chance of writing its own record into
Rose Bowl history.

Faculty Recognition

ROM time to time the singling out of some member of the Univer-

sity facnlty for state or national recognition serves to remind us

of the caliber of our teaching staff. Just recently two University

professors were appointed by Governor Gifford Pincliot to lend their

particular abilities to the solution of problems confronting the com-
monwealtli.

Dr. Samuel H. VVil1iams, professor of zoology and a member of
the Pennsylvania Game Commission, wa.s delegated to represent the
state body at a meeting of governors and commissioners of the Na.-
tional Game Commission, which convened last week in New York.
Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of economics, was appointed by the
Govc_.r.noi' to the state committee on workers’ security, which met for
the first time in Harrisburg last Tuesday. ‘

_Recognized for his achievements in the particular ﬁeld of his

- acadeinic interest, Dr. \Villiams is 21.11 unusual combination of the

academician and the practical zoologist. His meiiibership on the
game commission is one characterized by intense activity. Any posi-
tion of an “honorary” nature extended him would soon be convert.-
ed, by the very energy of the man, into a post that iiecessarily would
be labeled “active” for any and all his successors.

. Similarly, Dr. Tyson is outstanding among the leaders in his
chosen ﬁeld of scholastic investigation. His work as an economist,
however, has not been conﬁned to classroom instruction. His inter-
est in the practical application of classroom theory to current eco-
nomic problems is evidenced iii his appointment to the committee on
workers’ security. It is signiﬁcant to note that Dr. Tyson and the
other members of Governor ’s Pinchot’s committee, brought together

for the purpose of investigating unemployment conditions in the.

state and of making recommendations for their iinproveinen.t to the
legislature, are working without pay for their services.

The selection of both these men to represent the people in wide-
ly separated projects of public concern, in effect is more than a
recognition of their individual qualiﬁcations. It speaks well for the
high regard in which the faculty of the University and the standards
of the institution are held by persons other than ourselves.

Comment From Readers

ETTERS from readers of the Pitt News were published for the
ﬁrst time in the issue of November 30. The column began not
because the News felt it needed another feature for its editorial

page, but because persons outside our staff had something they want— -

ed to say to the student body and the University at large.

“Letters from our Readers” will appear just as often as our
readers feel the urge to express themselves for publication. We
have no intentions of resorting to either subtle or crude devices to
make the column a permanent feature of the newspaper. That
would defeat its purpose and be a not-too-clever insult to those of
you who feel intensely the urge to speak your minds in public.

company the inauguration of such a column. It is not our purpose
to invite the airing in the News of personal grievances that do not
concern the general student body. This is not the place to dig slyly
into your enemy’s back. Likewise, the editors reserve the right to
exercise their own standards of decency and good taste in the selec-
tion of letters for publication.

The limitations of space require that letters generally be limited

/to 250 words or less. Except in cases where the subject matter ob-

viously is deserving of more lengthy treatment, the editors will be
unable to print letters in excess of that size.

The opinions and convictions expressed in these letters are not
necessarily those held by the News. VVe offer them as the varying
and sometimes contradicting beliefs of our readers.

For example: in an editorial printed in the News we urged that,
when the time came for the appointment of a man to the office of
Dean of Men, serious consideration be given members of our own
faculty and administration. Ours was a plea for the selection of
a Pitt man for the oﬁce. VVe were not instituting a public campaign
for the selection of any one man. But we were and still are vitally
interested in seeing a Pitt man appointed to the position of Dean
of Men. Today, however, in two separate letters we ﬁnd students
urging the appointment of particular individuals to the office.

While we are sympathetic with their interest in hoping to see
some man from our own campus raised to the position of Dean of

.Men, we feel that it is not our place to pick the man. “To shall feel

our success complete if sonietimein the near future we learn that
the University has not been ignored as a source of outstanding ad-
ministrative talent.

To the Editor, Pitt News:

As an alumnus who was active in
activities during his four years at
Pitt, I feel compelled to reply to Ma-
ri_an Beyei"s ;letter printed in tlic
Pitt News for December 2, advocat-
ing the selection of a new Dean of
Men from out of town.

In her letter Miss Beyer says in
part, without qualiﬁcation: “Any man
that would be chosen from the Uni-
versity would have the same ideas
as his predecessor.” Evidently, she
forgets that the last Dean of Men was
Mi‘. Clotliier, a. Princeton man, who
left Pitt early last Spring to become
president of Rutgers. Since that
time, a. good deal of water has passed;
over the dam, and I fail to see why
any Pitt man who might be consider-
ed for the job would so surely have
become so contaminated with Mr.
C-1ot.liler’s ideas that he “would have
the same ideas as his predecessor.”
I know of no meinber of the Pitt fac-
ulty so weak minded that he “would
have the same ideas as his predeces-
sor.” '

Again; quoting from Miss Beyei"s
letter. she says, “Froiii one year to
the next, activities a.re operated on
the same plan.” Even if this state-
ment were entirely true, which it is
not, would this be so terrible Change
is not always good or desirable, and
a deﬁnite plan, which has been found
workable and progressive, experience
usually proves, leads to more prog-
ress than an uncohesive, unrelated,
welter of
new thoughts, and new plans no mat-
ter how good they are separately.
But as a matter of fact, a. great many
changes have been made in the oper-
ation of student activities at Pitt.
To mention only a few, the Pitt Pan-
tllel‘, the Owl, and the Pitt News all
have experimented lately with radi-

cal changes iii sta.ff organization; the!

Pitt News is now a senii-weekly, the
Pitt Pantlier now sells for ten cents
instead of a quarter, Cap and Gown
is atteniptiiig a student written show

.with some student written music for

the first time this year, the Glee Club

has made many program iinprove—
ineiits. the Pitt Band now numbers
120 men, properly equipped and

drilled. instead of 60 me.1i, poorly
equipped and drilled. And yet, Miss
Beyer, you have the nerve to state
without qualiﬁcation that “From one
year to the. next activities are operat-
ed oii the same plan!”

As a. niatter of fact, I happen to
know. Mr. VValter Rome and all other
a.dministratioii officials connected in
any way with activities are tireless
in urging the students (who, after
all, are the ones most interested) to
bring forward all new ideas, to de-
velop any new plans, and to get just
as many new thoughts as they possi-
bly ca.n.

O__n,a coniinoii sense basis, more
free of restrictions, red tape, and
l’aculty.interference than at almost
any other college or University in the
country, Pitt activities are encouraged
to develop and improve through the
efforts and thought of the students.

Further, Miss Beyer thinks that to

‘pick a man from the faculty or ad-

ministration “is a bad factor because
the students learn to regard the man
on a too personal basis.” Why, this
is the basis that any educator seeks
to re:-icli when he wants the cooper-
a.tion a.iid friendship of students!
VVould you have a. Dean of Men who,
like a god, sat behind 3. big desk is-
suing autocratic orders while he gets

;,“new,ideas and new thoughts?"
I

Vvlietlier l\Iiss.‘Beyer;-tliin-ks so oi‘
new ideas, plans, and

thoughts ai'en’t outside of Pitt. The

present Assistant Dean of Men, Mr.

Walter Rome, has had plenty of them,

land if the University adniinistration

intends to permanently combine the
duties of a Dea.n of Men with those
of a Graduate Manager, it i-s my belief
that they would have to conduct a
very long, intensive, and expensive
search before they would ﬁnd a bet-
ter ;man tliaii-the present assistant.

To the Editor, Pitt News:

In the issue of November 29 we read
with interest the editorial that a per-
son connected with the University
should be appointed to the office of
Dean of Men. This person should be
able to understand boys as to their

, (needs and have the best of the Uni-
Of course, we must append the statements which usually ac-'

versity at heart. Only a person well
acquainted with campus life and the
elements that tend to make all of the
men students just one big family
should be appointed to the post of
Dean of Men. Such a person, who
not only has the interest of the stu-
dent at heart, but who through years
as a member of the faculty has learn-
ed to understand them, we see in Dr.
Robert L. Jones.

Doctor Jones has been a member
of our faculty for many years and’ in
that time has been able to meet a.nd
uiiderstai.id boys and their needs.
Many of our student body have come
to him for advice and aid which he
was able to give at all times.

So we can honestly assure the Pitt
News and the administration that in
Dr. Jones we have the man who will
work for the interest of all concern-
ed if he is made the Dean of Men. I
am sure that the students will agree
that he is the man for the position.

Instead of a decent admission of
our duties to the unemployed, all
kinds of beatings about the bush are
offered. Notable among these is the
“Share Work Plan” for distributing

the editorials, is noble, ﬁne, 100 per

opener, Captain Paul Reider will be
in full strength. ”Bulldog” has been
wearing a. cast on his leg lately, but
this should be taken off within two
weeks, and, by January 2, should be
at his best. After a season of tough
luck such as Pau1 has gone tlirougli,
a ﬁnal blaze of glory would not be
amiss, and this is what Reider is look-I
ing forward to. If tlieﬁeld is hard
and dry, and ﬁelds in California are
usually that way, Reider may be able
to ﬂash the form which made him a
sensation last year. Not many crit-
ics are betting against him.

In recent years, west coast sport
writers have been pointing to South-
ern California as an exponent of the
ﬁnest footbal1 iii the country. They
clainied that with the exception of
Notre Dame, and one of two other far
western teams, the Trojans were far
superior to all the other gridders in
the country. They offered as proof
the Trojan’s crushing victory over
Pitt and Tulane in the Rose Bowl
games of 1930' and 1932, especially the
Pitt disaster.

Pitt Getting Ready

This year, with the Pitt eleven being
offered as representative of the super-
ior brand of eastern football, the west
coast writers hope to be able to point
again to the Trojans’ higher abilities.
But this year, the canny Scot, Jock
Sutherland, is determined to point the
proof the other way. Every trick in

the bag will be culled by Jock, a.nd a.
couple that never saw the inside of
a bag.

Howard Jones is reputed to have de-
veloped at Southern California the
most powei'fu1 offense of any coach
in the country. The number of sys-
tems lie has ﬁgured out is supposed
to run into two ﬁgures. Sutherland
here is famed for the defensive elev-
ens he turns out. And this year’s is
recognized as being one of the best.
The two tuors are exponents of two
entirely differen types of football. The-
clasii of their methods for the second
time is far from the least interesting
feature of the game. In the ﬁrst bat-
tle, Jones, of course, won 47-14.

Cagers Lose Pre-Season

Came To Goodyears, 32-25

A makeshift Pitt basketball squad
met its first defeat of the current sea-
son by losing to the Akron Goodyears
at Akron Saturday night as the clos-
ing feature of a basketball clinic,
32-25. -

Coach Carlson used a sophomore
lineup for the. most part, keeping Cap-
taiii Don Smith out of the game en-
tirely. The Pitt teain took an early
lead by virtue of free throws, but lost
it quickly, and at half time, the Good-
years held a 22-9 advantage.

Pitt came back strong in the second
half, holding their opponents to ten
points, but were unable to overcome
the first half deﬁcit. Mccamant
W'i1son, Cribbs, \Vainio, and the
Hughes boys each counted in the last
half. *
