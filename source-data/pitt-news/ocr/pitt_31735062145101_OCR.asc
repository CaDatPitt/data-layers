START STRUCTURAL
WORK THIS MONTH

Shipment Of Initial 3,000
Tons Of Steel Will
Start Activity

Within two‘_ weeks four towering
derricks, each esconced in separate
corners of the Cathedral lot, will
raise into upright positions‘ the huge
steel columns which will be the cen-
tral supports of the Cathedral of
Learning. The mixer still pours
cement into the caisson forms while
a gasoline pump is removing the
stagnant water, from the bottom of
the foundations. In the meanwhile, a
ramp has been constructed to fa-

cilitate the delivery of steel at the
Forbes Street and boulevard corner
of the lot and the first hoisting en-
gine has arrived and has been put
in position. Everything points to
immediate activity.

The Carnegie Steel and the Jones:
and Laughlin Steel Companies are
hurrying’ their shipments of steel
and 3,000 tons of it will soon be in
the hands of McClintoc Marshall
Steel Company where it willbe fab-
ricated in accordance‘ with the un-_
usual . plans of Cathedral construc-
 .

Initial deliveries of steel will’ be
thirty.-four large steel discs which
will form the basis for the main
column of . the Cathedral tower.
These massive billets are ‘from six
to nine inches thick and vary from
seven to nine feet in diameter,
weighing ﬁve to six tons each. They
will be placed over the cement cais-
sons and to them will be fastened
the main supportinggirders of the
structure. In spite of their huge size
these steel discs must be’, placed so
accurately that they will not vary
more than an eighth of an inch from
dead level and no more than this
same distanceooﬂ’ center.’

Then; Come the Columns

The erection of the main columns

will follow shortly after the slabs

cranes « and their hoisting engines
will be in’ working, order and the
ﬁrst structural steelwill be raised.

GRANDMOTHER

“LOTTE,” CAMPUS MOTHER, IS ONLY

ON PITT FACULTY

She does not totter through the
halls in lavender and old lace; she
swings by the groups that stand
under the clock in Alumni, calling
hello to her friends. And she has
many--some who have learned Ger-
man in her classes and others who
know her because they see her often
in the halls, her bag swinging on
her arm and her blue scarf waving.

According to the. University cata-
logues, she is Mrs. Lotte 0. Lohstoe-
ter, M. A., instructor in German; but
to certain individuals on the campus
the letters of her degree stand for

“llama” Lohstoeter. And being a
. mother to, everyone is the thing she

 doing.

   
 

She’s been mothering and helping
us ever since we lost our class
coupons down in the turmoil of
Syria Mosque the ﬁrst time we reg-
istered. When we worried about a
Psych ﬁnal last semester she advised
us to go and see a movie. We saw
Greta Garbo, and we passed. . .And
once we cried on her shoulder, once
when the “rush” of rushing was
wearing us out.

If you talk with the Z. T. A. girls
about Mrs. Lohstoeter they answer,
“You can’t say too many nice things
about our Mrs. Lohstoeter.” And if
you have ever sat in her classes or

‘,‘CUTE LITTLE PUP’?
BIT ES F ROSH CO-ED

Fearing Rabies, Coaxes Dog}
To Med. School
For Test

It was just a “cute little black and
white nondescript pup” to Willa
Salisbury, Pre-Dent. ’31, Wilmer-
ding, but when she stooped to fondle
it she was bitten on the left fore-
ﬁnger by an animal suffering from
rabies. ' I

The little dog had somehow found‘
itsway into the upper dental build-
ing Monday morning last week. It
snapped at Dr. Charles F. Brand,
demonstrator of dental anatomy, and
then bit Miss Salisbury. Realizing
that the bite. might prove serious
and fearing to pick the dog up, she

to the medical building where it was
examined. .
The dog's brain was removed and
dissected‘; examination revealed that
it- was afflicted with rabies. .
The Pasteur treatment in which
the patient is treated with 'succes.-
sive inoculations of a disease seru
increasing in strength is adminis-
tered Miss Salisbury by her father,
Dr. W. J. Salisbury. Immediate use
of the treatment saved Miss Salis-
bury from dangerous complications;
but now that the dog is dead she
complains of the attendant publicity
and wants everybody to forget it.

PROF. KITSONNAMED
' GUIDANCE SPEAKER

Columbia Psychologist And
Another Will Appear.
April 20

Professor Harry D. Kitson,
psychologist and professor of edu-
cation at Teachers College, Colum-
bia University, will be a principal
speaker on the program of voca-
tional guidance day set for April
20 in Memorial Hall. Another well
known person will be selected to ap-
pear on the program according to
James Sloan, Col. 28, chairman of
the committee.

Professor Kitson is the author of
several books on psychology and vo-
cations among which are “Scientific
Study of the College Student,”
“How to Use Your Mind," and “The
Psychology of Vocational Adjust-
ment.” He received his master of
arts degree from the University of
Minnesota in 1913 and the doctor of
philosophy degree from Chicago
University in 1915. He was formerly
professor of psychology at Indiana
University.

Prof. Kitson holds that problems
of vocational adjustment press still
more insistently upon institutions of
higher learning, and they ought to
receive especial attention in this
sphere. “Young men and women en-
ter colleges and universities in great
numbers with no settled vocational
aim. They make blunders and waste
time that could be used,” he mam-

For the first time in Pitt history,

head of the department of political
science at ;McGill University, is to

MODERNLITERATURE
WANTS REAL FACTS
Dr. Florence Teagarden Talks

On Psychology Trends
At ' Forum

“Modern literature is no longer
content with whitewashing, but. tries
to get the real facts without lying
or distortion,‘ and the most notice-
able trend is an histiric,’phyc'holo'g-
ical one‘—-that of biography,” Dr.
Florence’ M. Teagarden, assistant‘
professor of phychology, told mem-
bers of the psychology forum, Mon-
day, when she reviewed the works
and characteristics of recent writers
and characters" as shown by their
work.

Two minor trends are also appar-
ent in modern literature, namely, an
attempt to clarify the thinking of
man and of an intense interest in
Negro life, stated Dr. Teagarde.

The origin of biographical litera-
ture is not known, but the recent
trend may be considered as starting
with Lytton Strachey’s “Queen Vic-
toria,” which is the beginning of a
{ieild of literature which is most pro-

I c.
Physical Aﬁects Thought

Among those authors whose style
has been colored by this trend to-
ward phychography, are Emil Lud-
wig and Gamaliel Bradford.

No’ only physical conditions but
also home conditions affect the
thought of men. Harvey 0’Higgins
and W. W. Reid, authors of “The
American Mind in Action,” affirm
that Mark Twain’s humor resulted
from an inferiority complex, and
that though Emerson preached self-
reliance, he hi: .self was not self-re-
liant. Another example of the ef-
fect of early home conditions on the
thought of men, Dr. Teagarden said,
is given by Joseph Wood Crutch in
his biography of Poe. In this work,
Crutch points out that Poe began
his literarv career because of an in-
feriority complex and a desire to
compensate himself for the social

 QUESTION ONE -
FOR ORGANIZATIONS

Interested In Student
Action On Issue

“When we ﬁnd a key that is ex-;
pressive of the ideal of service to
Pitt and which we feel’ is suited to
the need we have of it, then we
shall offer it to the campus. organ-
izations of the University and ask
them to accept or reject it as they
see fit,” John R. Johnston, graduate‘
manager of student activities, de-
clares concerning the question of the
recently proposed standardized key
to be awarded’ by Pitt activities.

By the plan proposed, one stand-
ard activity key inscribed with the
name of the activity or activities in
which its recipient has served will
supplant the individual keys awarded»
by various different campus‘ activi-

ties.
Suggested by Students

The plan for the standard key was
suggested to Mr. Johnston by stu-‘
dents of the University who were
dissatisﬁed with the present method
of awarding keys and believed that,
by a standardized method,'rewards
for work on outside activitiesﬂwould
«approach a more e uitable basis.
After several co erences ‘ with
deans and other administrative
officials, Mr. Johnston was author.-
ized to proceed with plans _ for the
choosing of a suitable key for the
standard awarding. As ‘yet no de-
sign has been accepted and when a
design has been chosen it will be
presented to each campus or aniza-
tion. and activity which awar s‘ keys
for individual opinions-. This poll will
be‘ taken at the end of the semes-'1
ter, according to present plans, says
Mr. Johnston.

“It is not our idea to force the
standard key on Pitt students,?' he
adds. “Since the initiative came
from the students; themselves and
the idea. was developed; by. the ., ad-
ministration, we feel that W68-17¢. be‘

tion. 0 the entire campusfor ap-
proval." .

of the girls who has just patched -up
things with a"boy friend, you would»
agree with them.

Mrs. Lohstoeter is partial to girls;
she admits so herself. For yearsshe;
has been advisor to the Women's
Self-Government Association, and [it
was Mrs.‘ Lohstoeter who insisted
that the freshman girls be repre-
sented on the W. S.‘ G. A. 
sion. She has helped the Panhel-.
lenic Association and the Girls’ Glee
Club. In fact, she has Iaeen advisor
to so many organizations that .the
other day she said, ‘‘It -makes me
blush tothink that I was foolish
enough toaccept so many sponsor‘-'
ships only to _drop them because of
lack of time.” '

But Mrs. Lohstoeter has time for
herteaching, and she brings all her
individual contacts into her class-
room. methods. Allowing her more
brilliant students to Work ahead for
themselves, she is able to spend
more time with the orer ones. And
usually one ﬁnds rs. Lohstoeterlin
ll? Alumni giving special help1dqr-
ing her free hours. Her _Gernian'
Club is very active on the cam "s.f1
And it is said that to winiMrs._ . h-
stoeter’s love one must belong to her
club and speak‘ German. ’ ._

With all,her activities Mrs. Loh-g

carry three ‘courses toward her, doc-
tor’s degree, and every summer ‘she
and her husband, who is a teacher
at Peabody High School, spend in
study. Lastsummer they spent in

marketing the lamp himself, he
handed the contract over to the F.
A. Lundy Company, an international
engineering and sales company. Over
300,000 of these lamps have been

sold at $12 each.

Young Caveny who holds many
other patents in signal work ‘in ad-
dition to the electric. switch lamp,
expects to receive the degree, of
science in—engineering in June from
the University of Pittsburgh. His
education has suffered many‘ inter-
ruptions since his ﬁfteenth year
when he was forced to leave school
because of ﬁnancial difficulties. ,

At that time he began working
for the railroad as messenger boy,
but advanced to clerkship after he
had completed a night course in
stenography. Wishing, however, to
become an engineer, he left that po-
sition to take one a! half-. the sal-
ary laying underground wires inthe
telegraph and signal department of
the railroad.

 

for admission to a university in
Michigan where he was admitted
without full secondary school cre-
dentials. To pay his expenses while
in school here,’ he worked for _,the
Packard and Maxwell Companies
and as secretary -to the business
manager of the Detroit News. En-
listing in the war in 1917, he served

saw special service with the infan-
tries on the Aisne-Marne, and with
the twenty-sixth Yankee Division
during the .Amerioan expedition.
After the“ war heobtained work as
a. maintainer of the telegraph and
signals for the railroad. However,

The worst thing in the world to try‘

to ﬁnd_is‘a good pipe tobacco that is,
well wlthm the reach of everybody,
and at the same time does not taste

like it had just come out of the cabbage- _ ‘

patch.

I have been smoking a pipe for two I ,

years and have just this month started
to smoke a real smoke, Ed eworth. If
at first you don't sue , try, try
again. Believe me, I tried for two years,
but ﬁnally success is more than mine.

I have just been looking around,
and have found to my delight that I
can get Edgeworth practicall any-
where. I even found it out at the-lake
near Dallas where I go ﬁshing. Oh boy,
what a combination—-a perfect day, a
can of good tobacco, and your pipe.

I alwa "s thought these ad letters

somebody is wrong and that is me.

SPRING GRID WORK

Over 100 Gridders Receive
Dummy Workouts And
Signal Drills

 NEW MEN REPORT

Coach Sutherland Not Too
Opt'_' °  Over: Prospects
F or Next Year

 

I_n spité of the inclement weather,
spring _-‘football ‘practice has been
continued throughout the past week.
During the first part of the week
the me1_i___ weie loosened up by cal-
estlienics, but in the last few days
the practice turned tifworkouts on
the dummyffundamental defensive
and oﬁensive plays and signal prac-

tice. — ~ -—

Dr. Sutherland expresses his opin-
ion 'of the teiﬁn as a “ﬁghting team
that may not_'win all its games, but
one that will‘ do the. Panther credit
There seems” little’ doubt that ‘ the
100 odd men who are out for the
squad are .‘ ting men,’ otherwise,
they would npt be out. The team,
as a wholeﬁis -lacking the funda-
mentals of -the game, but the two
months of spring practice will enable
them to be drilled at least in those
points.” .- . ~ ~

Captain Felt, ﬁghting guard, says
of the team .'t‘It will be only a mir-
acle that» will save the ‘team from a
bad segﬁoit. If Jock turns out eleven
men d led in the fundamental tac-
tics of the game by September, it
will be nothingshort of a miracu-
lous ha_p'fpen'ing. " -Of course two
months“o practice will do much, but

we have one of the toughest sched-
ules Pitt ever bucked up against,
‘this year, and the prospects cer-
tainly-do not look-very good.”
Charlie Edwards, varsity halfback
and probable candidate for quarter,
comments: “We won’t win every
ame, but we won't lose them either;
here iaplenty. of new -material from
which we certainly ought to be able
to fashion a fairl _ good team. Pitt's
sguad will he ﬁsh. .,ns every moment
o every game that they play, and
ineuch’ can.._happen with a ﬁghting
am. ’ -

Dave Stewart, football manager,
expresses the opinion that “even if
g,e,;_l_oi_i_’t’ have a ood team this ‘sea-

son, neitf ‘year’ " itt"wiI1' have’ an-*'

other championship squad. More
new men jlpve turned out this year
than"‘ever,;and each ~ man‘ is being
given individual attention. The
coaches. are giving their best to the
team§.. ,8.nd;certainly this will show
afte‘r"‘-‘a.'=-.. ‘ear of. experience. The

spiritjis t ere, if the technique isn’t, .

so let’s hope» for the best.”

Don Saunders, publicity sports
maria I er, believes ‘that the school
“shoud not be too-;.optimistic.” Ac-
cording to: Saunders, “the green ma-
terialsdoes not look especially good.
Of co!'urse,‘.itis-Va little early to tell,
bu_t;‘Dr. Sutherland will have a
mighty tougli-tiine-to turn outs de-

'cent"squad.’ - ' . _ -

This diversion of opinionmay be
due 5 largely: to the ditferentangles
from_ which the squad: is viewed.
There seems to be concensus of‘
opinions. however, that Pitt will not
have, a championship‘ team this ear,
butgthe followingseason it wl ‘ be
the {nucleus for another winner.

ford, but in its regular season was

What the basketball team from
Smoketown did is not likely to be
forgotten soon in the middle west,
for‘ the Panthers mapped up every
Big Ten conference squad they
played, four orﬁve of them, as we
recall it. Then, for good me_asur_e,
they defeated Notre Dame, which, in
its him, had just about established
its claim to the title of best in the
west by smothering several western
conference schools. The Pitt swim-
mers swam d Carnegie Tech twice,
Wooster co lege of Ohio, the Army
and Notre_ Dame. In indoor track and
cross country, the record of. the Blue
and Gold is etlually impressive. Their
tennis team ast year lost its ﬁrst

feated. There must be something
back of a record like this, for Pitt's
teams do not play “so " schedules.

The writer can remember when it
used to be said—with what justice
we do not know—that Pitt did a lot
of ' heavy “recruiting” and that its
eligibility standards would not bear
too close scrutiny. Whether this-was
ever true in the past, it is not a just
accusation today. We are credibly in-
formed that_ the Panthers have to
meet as still» academic requirements
as do the athletes of any eastern
universit . Another bit of evidence
to show t at their recruiting isle iti-
mate is the large percentage of _ tt
students who come from the Pltts-‘
burgh district. This university has
almost as homogeneous a student

Prospects for a bright fresh track
season received a severe blow last
week when Utterback, crack frosh
spiker, was declared ineligible to
compete for the Panthers this spring.

Utterback, of Maseﬁeld, Ky}, is
unable to run with the fresh spikers
because of his advance standinzi. and
is also barred from the varsity by
his ‘lack of one year’: residence.’

“The formula that I believe en-
abled Pitt to win as it did this ear
is a simple one,” writes Dr. . J.
Carlson, coach of the Blue and
Gold's undefeated basketball squad.
“First. there was the idea of a par-
ticular success, and second,_ the_ will-
ingness to sacriﬁce everything inor-
der to achieve that success. . . .
can not explain that secret of Pitt’s
basketball success is due to any-
thing on the order of subtle coach-
ing, but rather to the fact that the
Pitt’ boys shot more baskets than
their opponents. This is simple, isn’t
it?” .It certainly is—-but try to du-
plicate it with another set_ of boys.

Coach Carlson has a philosophy of
competition which, we thin has
more to do with his success than
athletic material or technique. He
sums it up so well that we reprint
his words below, feeling that they
express tersely about all the philos-
ophy that the athletic competition
has to offer to, men and boys who
would succeed in sports, in business,
professions or any other life activity.
Others have said the same thing
well. It. is not new. But every word
of it is true and worth while. Here
is the way this coach of an unbeaten
university basketball team sums up
the secret" of his success:

“With all the ability in the world,
you can not have a winner unless
you have the desire to win and the
grit and determination.”

Michigan" Political Science
Teacher Urges Idea
Adoption Here

.“Pittsburgh will regain its for-
mer prestige and prosperity if the
inhabitants of Allegheny county
adopt the metropolitan plan of gov-
ernment at the next election in No-
venﬂier,” Dr. Thomas H. Reed, of
the department of political science
at the University of Michigan and
director of research for the Greater
Pittsburgh commission, declared at a
luncheon meeting of the social
science seminar at Faculty club Fri-

ay.

_Dr._ Reed gave the history and ad-
visability o the metropolitan plan
and the evolution of the city for the
last few centuries. He showed that
in the last twenty years. remarkable
strides have? been taken by growing
cities and that the theories of trans-

 

days have changed. Pittsburgh has
been able to cope with the problem
of transportation and ex ansion
only partially and not su ciently
enough to rank as a great city, he
said.

The commission, which was ap-

the metropolitan plan is adopted.

“It will be a unit of government,”
Dr. Reed stated, “but not a consoli-

adoption of the plan as now pro-
posed will result in the form of a

ﬁcial to ittsburgh and its vicinity.
The outlying districts will be as
