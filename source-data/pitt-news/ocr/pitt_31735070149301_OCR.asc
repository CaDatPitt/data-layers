One of America’s oldest sororities is cel-
ebrating its 100th anniversary this year, and
members of the Pitt community are joining
in the festivities.

Pitt Delta Sigma Theta members took part
in two separate celebrations this month, one
at Pitt and another in Washington, D.C., to
recognize the centennial of the historically
black sorority and its focus on public ser-
vice. Pitt’s Delta Sigma Theta chapter was
established 1921.

Cynthia Bradley—King, an assistant pro-
fessor in Pitt’s School of Social Work, was
among those representing Pitt at the D.C.
celebration, which took place the weekend
of Jan. 11 at Howard University, where the
Deltas were founded. She said that 13,000
Deltas had registered for the event, but even
more showed up.

“The campus was peppered with red,”
Bradley-King said. .

The weekend consisted of various events
that helped new sisters meet and old sisters
bond together to rejoice. The convention
included service projects, ceremonial rituals
and the lighting of the White House in Delta
Sigma Theta’s color, red.

On the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 11, the
Delta sisters gathered around Fortitude — a
statue at Howard University, which was a gift

from the sorority to the university in 1978
— and sang songs. The ﬁgure has one arm
reaching up for success and one arm reach-
ing down to help her sisters along the way.

Pitt Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey,
also a Delta sister, said the statue represents
the saying, “we lift as we climb.”

“As you climb and as you become stron-
ger, you don’t forget about where you’ve
come from and what your responsibilities
are,” Humphrey said. “It is not enough to
do well, you need to help others do well.”

Between 5,000 and 6,000 women
showed up on the rainy day to take part in
the Fortitude ritual. When they sang the
“Sweetheart Song,” a long-standing Delta
Sigma Theta tradition, there wasn’t a dry
eye in sight, according to Sherdina Harper,
a Delta and the coordinator of Cross Cultural
and Leadership Development at Pitt.

The Deltasﬂwere founded on the prin-
ciples of “service, scholarship and sister-
hood,” so while in D.C., they performed 22
service projects in honor of the 22 founders
of the organization.

Alaine Allen, a Delta and the director of
Pitt’s engineering career access program,
explained the motive behind this service
initiative.

“Let’s not just come be together, but also
make an impact on the place,” she said.

Group outlines steps to end
global poverty in lecture ~

Pat McAteer
News Editor

Members of an international nonproﬁt
organization with the goal of eradicating
poverty worldwide within the next 50 to
60 years told Pitt students Thursday night

that history indicates that poor countries '

can emerge from degradation with inter-
national help.

During the presentation at 6:30 p.m. in
the O’Hara Student Center, Brittany Aubin, a
member of Global Poverty Project, an initia-
tive funded by organizations such as the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation and UNICEF,
said 1.4 billion people worldwide survive on
$1.50 a day. ’

This, she said, gives them low purchasing
power parity, forcing them into a situation
where they have “a lack of basic opportunity
and choice.”

tographer

“For most people in the developing world,
that’s going to equal two bowls of rice, maybe
some beans and vegetables, a bit of oil to
cook with and some fuel — enough for just
two meals a day,” Aubin said.

Aubin said that often people who don’t
live in these environments feel that those
trying to help are “ﬁghting a losing battle.”
But, she said, countries like South Korea and
Ghana exemplify national economic revival.

In the 19505, South Korea had a gross
domestic product lower than that of Uganda,
which is widely known as one of the poor-
est nations in Africa. But after the U.S. and
other nations invested in South Korea fol-
lowing the Korean War, the nation thrived
and became a producer of popular products
such as Samsung electronic products and
Hyundai cars.

Pitt prepares for second matchupof year against Cincy

Nate Barnes _
Senior Suﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Pitt men’s basketball team will head
to" Cincinnati this weekend for a rematch
against its ﬁrst Big East opponent of the
season. In their ﬁrst conference game, the
team lost to Cincinnati on New Year’s Eve.
This time the Panthers will look to add to
their Winning streak, having won six of its
last seven Big East games.

The No. 23 Panthers (19-5, 7-4 Big East)
lead the No. 17 Bearcats (18-5, 6-4 Big East)
by just a half—game in the Big East confer-
ence standings and will need to exact re-
venge on Cincinnati in order to stay within
a game of co_nference—leaders Syracuse and
Marquette. .

Led by redshirt senior guard Travon
Woodall, who tops the team in scoring at
10.8 points per game, the Panthers ﬁrmly
believe they can make up for the December
loss simply because Pitt is a much more im-
proved team than the one Cincinnati faced
roughly a month and a half ago. _

“This is a totally different team than the
one in December,” Woodall said. “Defen-
sively, we’re a much better team.” _

In the December game, Bearcat guard

Cashmere Wright burned the Panthers
down.the stretch with multiple jumpshots

out of isolation sets and ﬁnished with a‘

game-high 18 points. On Saturday, Wood-
all and the rest of the guards will need to
prevent Wright from repeating his previous
successes. l

“The ﬁrst half he didn’t give us too much,
but in the second half when times were
critical, he hit a big shot -— he hit a deep

. three,” Woodall said-. “We just‘ gotta keep up

the ball pressure and keep bothering him.”

Pitt’s defense and rebounding will be
most important for head coachjamie Dixon.
The defense will become especially impor-
tant on the perimeter, where Dixon relies
on Woodall. . . '

“What he’s doing best for us is his de-

-fense,” Dixon said.

In the ﬁrst contest, Cincinnati shot 41.2
percent from the ﬁeld —— above the 40 per-
cent mark, which Dixon wants his defense
to hold teams under. The Bearcats also sur-
passed the Panthers 30-27 in rebounds, an
area Dixon always wants Pitt to dominate.

“Since the last time we played [Cincin-
nati], we feel we’ve improved defensively,

Nearly one—third of the way through the Big East
schedule, the Pitt men’s basketball team found
itselfamong the main stories of the league after
it pulled off one of the best results of the week
with a double—digi decision over Syracuse at
The Petersen Events Center on Saturday. Despite
losing to Pitt, however, Syracuse remains at the
top of the conference.

1. No. 9 Syracuse (19—3, 7-2 Big East)

The Orange rebounded from a two—game
losing streak with a 16-point win over No. 25
Notre Dame at home. Of all teams, Syracuse
owns the highest Ratings Percentage Index —
an algorithm that takes into account a team’s
record, its opponents’ records and its oppo-
nents’ opponents’ records —— with a rating of

I .661, which places the Orange at No. 7 among

all Division I basketball schools. I

2. No.11 Louisville (19—4, 7-3)

After losing three in a row, Louisville rides a
three—gamewin streakthatbegan atthe expense

» of Pittsburgh and continued with wins over

Marquette and Rutgers. Marquette started its
visit to the KFC Yum! Centerwith a 9-1 run over
the Cardinals, but Montrezl Harrell came off the
bench and instantly energized the Cardinals

Pitt’s Win over Syracuse helps it vault into conference’s top three

en route to a 70-51 victory over Buzz Williams’
Golden Eagles.

3. No. 23 Pittsburgh (19—5, 7-4)

Pittsburgh seems to have established itself
in the Big East with its win Saturday against
then-No. 6 Syracuse, following the win with a
solid performance inaclassic trap game against
Seton Hall on Monday. Now the Panthers will
have vengeance on their minds with consecutive

C games against Cincinnati and Marquette — two

teams that have already beat Pitt this season
and reside near the Panthers in the conference
standings. _

4. No. 24 Marquette (16-5, 7-2)

Buzz Williams still has his team hanging
around the top of the conference, butthe Golden
Eagles face a test in the coming week after tak-
inga drubbing from Louisville on Sunday with
a matchup Monday against Georgetown —— _a
team that’s shown a penchant for knocking off
the conference’s top teams.

5. No. 17 Cincinnati (18-5, 6-4)

Cincinnati faces somewhat of aproverbial
turning point in its season after losing a game
that it should have won Wednesday against
Providence. Cincinnati now plays Pittsburgh
at home, with the Panthers coming to the Fifth

said. -

Finlay encourages students to sign up
for the Career Fair through the my.pitt.
edu portal on the left side of the homep-
age titled, “Take Action.” Doing so will
grant students the ability to preview the
Career Fair directory of employers plan-

Guaranteed internship program finds early success

Pitt’s Office of Career Development and Placement Assistance launched a program

this fall to help all interested students secure an internship. Kenny Ong |Visual Editor

Kelan Lyons
For The Pitt News

After joining Pitt’s Internship Preparation
Program in August, it didn’t take junior
Lauren Dunn long at all to ﬁnd an intern-
ship related to her communication rheto-
ric major. _ .

“When I came in for my ﬁrst one—on—
one meeting, my internship prep coordi-
nator told me that she wasn’t so familiar
with openings for my position,” Dunn said.
“Later that very day, I got an email from
her with a list of seminars to go to, as well
as a list of internship openings here in
Pittsburgh.”

Dunn now has -an internship with
WQED Multimedia, a public broadcasting
company in Pittsburgh.

Pitt rolled out its new Internship Prepa-
ration Program last August, offering the
chance for its roughly 18,000 undergradu-
ate students to obtain an internship or
other work and clinical-related experi-
ences before graduation. About 480 stu-
dents have enrolled in the program, and
although the ﬁnal session on etiquette
and professionalism won’t take place until
April, 14 students, including Dunn, hav
received internships so far. -

According to Cheryl Finlay, the director
of Pitt’s Oﬂice of Career Development and
Placement Assistance, students who wish

to participate in the program must sign
up on FutureLinks, a career—management
system that students can access from the
my.pitt portal. The program begins with a
one—hour initial group session conducted

by the internship team on Thursdays and '

Fridays at which students are given an in-
troduction to the essential components of
searching for internships..

Finlay encourages participants to uti-
lize walk—in hours, scheduled appoint-
ments and additional resources to gain
one—on—one support from the CDPA office.
Those resources include personal resumé
reviews, assessment appointments with
the internship staff, mockeinterviews to
help students succeed in individual inter-
views, personal appointments to search
for available internships with the’Intern-
ship Team and an end—of-term group ses-
sion on etiquette and professionalism.

CDPA’s end goal for the Internship
Preparation Program is to provide stu-
dents with the necessary skills and ammu-
nition to guarantee them an internship by
the end of their time at Pitt.

_ Workshops such as the Internship Prep
Program have earned Pitt a national rank-
ing in the top six colleges that graduate

Numbers prove nursing and engineering to be hot fields

Shruti Revankar
Stczjj” Wrz'ter

With the ﬁerce budget battles in Con-
gress, Pennsylvania’s above-national-
average unemployment rate of 7.9 per-
cent and the news stories every day that
highlight the struggles of Americans
trying to find a job, there is no doubt
that America is going through a tough
time economically. .

However, it may come as a surprise
to some that there -are several jobs that
are actually experiencing or are pro-
jected to experience considerable suc-
cess inthe upcoming 10-year period,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is a
federal agency that specializes in col-
electing and analyzing statistics in the
broad field of labor economics. Teri
Morisi, a branch chief at the bureau,
said that, in terms of outlook, there are
two ways to View occupations: fastest
percent growth and the largest net gain
in jobs.

Morisi said that registered nurses
are expected to top the list of occupa-
tions with the largest job growth, with
712,000 new jobs. Registered nurses
are followed by retail sales persons,
home health aids, personal care aids

 

While jobs canine difficult to find across the board, certain professions have many

openings for new graduates. MCT Campus

and office clerks.
Julius Kitutu, assistant dean at Pitt’s
School of Nursing, said that nurses are

in huge demand because of changes
in the health care‘ industry and demo-
graphic changes in the United States.

“Nurses are required almost every-
where nowadays, and the aging popula-
tion here requires nursing,” Kitutu said.

But nursing isn’t the only career in
health care with a rising demand.

“The fastest growing are a little dif-
ferent. Home health care aids and per-
sonal care aids are at the top,” Morisi
said.

The number of positions for person-
al care aids is projected to grow 71 per-
cent, and the number for home health
care aids is projected to grow 69 per-
cent. The last two on the list are situat-
ed in the construction industry and in-
clude stone masons and brick masons.

The field for biomedical engineers
has seen growth of 62 percent, and US
Steel Dean of Engineering and Pitt Pro-
fessor Gerald Holder was not surprised
that engineering is one of the fastest-
growing professions.

He said that engineers are in de-
mand because they create processes
and products needed for the basis of the
U.S. and world economies.

“‘[Engineers] are essential for a ro-
bust economy and are needed for the
design of planes,'cars, iPhones, artifi-

Recent graduates face underemployment

Some students take on minimum-wogejoos as t/oey seezrc/ofor other work or more education

Megan Trimble
Assistant News Editor

Luke Sonnet completed eight semesters
at Pitt and graduated in December, but he
still hasn’t left.

Sonnet graduated summa cum laude
with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Eco-
nomics, Political Science and History, and
plans to enroll in a graduate degree pro-
gram to pursue a political science Ph.D. His
ultimate goal is to remain in academia by
teaching in universities as a professor and
completing independent research to study
comparative politics with a focus on legis-
lative and electoral rules and outcomes.

But even three majors and a high GPA
could not spare him from taking on a
minimum—wage job at The Book Center on
campus.

“I do enjoy working [at The Book Cen-
ter] because I do enjoy the people that
work there and it is low stress. However, it
isn’t the best use of my abilities or skills.
Nor does it have anything to do with my
ultimate career ambitions in political sci-
ence or in geopolitical data analysis,” Son-
net said.

The government’s Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics does not release ﬁgures on underem—

ployment due to “the difficulty of develop-
ing an objective set of criteria which could
be readily used in a monthly household
survey.” But according to an April 2012
report by the Associated Press, “about 1.5
million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor’s-de-
gree holders under the age of 25 last year
were jobless or underemployed, the high-
est share in at least 11 years.”

The ﬁnding was based off an analysis
of 2011 Current Population Survey data
by Northeastern University researchers
and supplemented with material from Paul
Harrington, an economist at Drexel Uni-
versity and the Economic Policy Institute,
a Washington think tank.

With more students graduating and fac— a

ing a difficult job market, more like Sonnet
are choosing underemployment — tempo-

rarily accepting minimum-wage jobs that

oftentimes do not align with the skills that
their bachelor’s degrees stand for.

To supplement his work at The Book

Center, Sonnet took on a paid, part—time
job with a startup soccer analytic ﬁrm to
strengthen his statistics skills in case he
chooses to utilize them in the private sec-
tor.

10 zy-good tips for successful interviews

1. Arrive 10 to 15 minutes early. *

2. Dress appropriately for the interview.

3. Research the organization you’re applying to.

4. Have questions prepared about the organization and position.

5. Know yourself: Why do you want the job? What are your interests,
strengths, capabilities, weaknesses and short- and long—term goals?

6. Start strong — ﬁrm handshake, eye contact, pleasant smile,
conﬁdence. You earned this interview.

 

7. Maintain interest and enthusiasm during the interview: Lean forward,
nod, listen and respond.

8. Pause after a question is asked. Take time to understand the question,
and consider your response before speaking. -

9. Answer personality and behavioral questions with speciﬁc examples
of your past performance. If it’s a question about weakness, answer
thoughtfully rather than trying to turn a weakness into a strength.

10. End strongly. Stand up, smile, shake hands and thank the person for
his or h time.

THE STAMATTACK

Consider the beneﬁts of
interacting with diverse
age groups at work

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

If you have ever watched the
Disney Channel, you have
quickly discovered a"_univer-
sal truth: Grown-ups are really
dumb when it comes to technol-
ogy. '

They don’t get Facebook,
they" are bemused and per-
plexed by cordless phones, and
they.don’t get the ‘fuss of tex-
ting. Every pugnacious 9-year-
old can out-Instagram or out-
code Gramps.

In practice, we find this isn’t
necessarily true, and we admit
consciously’ that these thoughts
are ridiculous. It’s been a few
years since our perceptions
of the world were shaped by
tweendom: I, for instance, am
Very comfortable with a basket-

on some level. The sting of our
parents on Facebook has by now
largely disappeared, but watch-
ing a 55-year-old take a selﬁe
is still sometimes a bit weird.
When we see that mysterious
group of older, responsible peo-
ple doing things like this, it can
feel like we are watching some-
thing very far away.

' It’s not surprising that there
is a disconnect. College, for all
its pleasures and benefits, has
failed to teach us anything about
intergenerational communica-
tion. It’s no surprise that there
is such a gap in perception.

The experiences in diversity
that define the university expe-
rience are not designed to close

this gap. We have interacted.

TECH TALK

Repair and update your online reputation before graduation

Tiemoko Ballo
Columnist

Onjan. 1., California and Illinois joined
four other states in passing legislation
that makes it illegal for an employer to
demand access to employees’ or poten-
tial employees’ non-public Facebook
data. Pennsylvania might eventually
follow suit, but in the meantime, you
should seriously start considering how
you’re representing yourself online.
There are no real privacy guarantees on
the Internet, and new legislation won’t
necessarily protect your reputation.
Whether you’re graduating this spring
and looking for a real-world job or just
searching for a summer internship be-
fore coming back in the fall, your digital
footprint could make or break your job
search.

According to an April 2012 survey
of 2,000 hiring managers from Career-
Builder.com — the largest employment
website in the United States — two out
of five companies use social networking
sites to research applicants, and about
a third of those that do have previously

discovered something online that costs

an applicant the job. Realizing the im-
portance of managing personal online

presence, several universities have be-
gun to offer students tools to clean up
their online image, optimize their con-
tent in search results and receive alerts
when misleading results appear in
searches for their name. Syracuse Uni-
versity gave graduating seniors BrandY-
ourself.com before switching over to an
alumni-founded online reputation re-
pair company and extending accounts
to the university’s entire student popu-
lation.

Unfortunately, Pitt does not current-
ly offer access to any services of this
type. So what are your options? Well
the first and most obvious step you can
take is to not add fuel to the ﬁre. Filter
your content. This means making sure
any material you don’t want the world
to see has the appropriate privacy set-
tings -— or better yet, isn’t online at
all. If you wouldn’t want it appearing
on the front page of a newspaper, you
shouldn’t post, upload or tweet it. And
if you must publicize something contro-
versial, don’t use your legal name.

Maintaining your digital footprint
means more than merely doing damage

Wllen facing the ‘real World,’
Where do We look ﬁrst?

 

 

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

Great. It’s 2013. The year you’re graduat-
ing.

Here comes the real world. It’s time to
ﬁnd a job, and you have to ﬁnd one quickly
before your student loans come knocking
at your door. Soon enough, our debt will
swallow us whole.

Unless we manage to ﬁnd a job, that is.
But not just any job. I’m sure most of this
semester’s graduating seniors are or have
been employed to some extent in their 22
years on Earth, whether they wait tables
on weekends, work on campus during the
school year orhave some sort-of summer
gig back home.

Thosejust won’t do anymore. This “job”
we’re all searching for is one that we are
able to stick with on a semi—permanent ba-
sis, one with enough salary for us not only
to survive, but also to pay for our educa-
tion and one with, heaven forbid, the right
kind of medical beneﬁts to take care of us.
We are adults. ,

I’m starting to sweat just thinking about
it. I P ‘
There are so many scenarios that I don’t
think any of us are prepared to handle
just yet. Or ever. Perhaps it’s just way too
stressful, and we have no idea what we’re
supposed to do. We’re all full of questions,
and I’m sure everyone is wondering the
same thing.

What if I ﬁnd a job that -has absolutely

nothing to do with what I’ve studied at

Pitt? Is the political science major in me

 

It’s important to edit your resume for applications. Luv Purohit [Senior Staff Photographer

equipped to work in a company’s HR de- '

partment‘?

I don’t know. .

What if I ﬁnd a job that sounds like
something that’s moderately related to
what 'I’ve been learning, but the position
requires two years of prior experience "in
the ﬁeld? Do I apply anyway? It doesn’t
sound like it would be that hard of a job.

Beats me. -

When, between the lwriti,ng—intensive
classes, on-campus job, internship and
homework can I go interview for a job?
When can I even look for a job? Or where

do I even start? I want to be social at some

point, too!

I can’t even fathom a respectable an-

swer to these. V

_ The hard, unforgiving truth is, as some-
one who is graduating in three months, I
have literally no idea how to handle the
nextjchapter of my life. I am positive that
I am not the only one facing this struggle,
either.

Where is the guidebook? Is therea class
that Pitt offers called “Introduction to the
Real World 101?” No. Can someone please
teach it, then? Where do we turn next?

In an ideal world, the last semester of

college would just -be a time for us to ﬁgure
something out. Even if it’s ﬁnding a job that
would only be a temporary gig, we could at
least pack up our apartments in ‘Oakland
and feel some sense of comfort as we move
forward.

You’ve ironed your dress pants, proof-
read your resumé and researched the

working world? Being knowledgeable
and well—prepared is a major step. I had
the opportunity to interview Sammi
Soriano, a recruiter at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and get
her advice on landing that first profes-

A: I think for students it should start
on campus. Never again will you have
hundreds of companies coming to you,
trying to get you to apply to their jobs
and to learn about their companies. It

stand out.

Q: When you review resumes and ap-
plications, what is it that catches your‘
attention and makes you _want to invite
someone to interview?

A: The people who tailor the appli-
cation to our company. They’vev read

ps from a UPMC recruiter

the job description — they know the
keywords. For example, ours might be
“communication skills,” “leadership”
and “analytical skills.” If they can think
of work experiences and examples and
use those words, it really makes me vi-
sualize that candidate in the position.
For me, it’s then a no-brainer to move
that candidate onto the next step be-
cause they’ve said everything I’m look-

ing for. People who realize what we look

for, read the job description and then
personalize that resumé using those
same adjectives and phrases — in ap-

propriate ways 0 course — really help

us visualize that person in that role.

Q: Many students are very concerned
with the importance of GPA in the ap-
plication process. How much emphasis
is placed on GPA?

A: That depends on the company
and on the program. For me and the
positions I recruit for, since they’re set
programs — the top executives want
to‘ hire 20 finance interns for example
—— we do have a very strict GPA cut-
off. For programs, most companies do
have strict qualiﬁcations. For most of
ours it’s a 3.0, for some it’s a 3.2 or 3.4.

Closet staples make up fashionable, appropriate work attire

Grace Kelly
Staff Wrz’ter

When you are being interviewed for a job,
your appearance and what you wear is
signiﬁcant. The “don’t judge a book by its
cover” rhetoric that we were spoon—fed in
kindergarten does not apply. Rather, ﬁrst
impressions count, and the first thing a
potential employer sees is your outward
appearance.

In college, we are used. to just rolling
out of bed, throwing on a pair of sweats,
one—arming the backpack and trudging to
class. But as we all know, a job interview
is not class, and your potential boss will
never encourage pajama days.

So, what do you wear? Regardless of
your interview type, there are some basic
rules for entering the job market: Always
iron your clothes, match your belt to your
shoes and tuck your shirt into your pants. .
Interviews are not the place for edgy fash-
ion, and it’s better to remain conservative
and professional than flashy and out of
line. Then, before you break out the suit
collecting dust in your closet, consider
what kind of job you are applying for.

If it’span internship with PNC Bank,
then yes, your no-longer dusty suit is i
probably the best choice.]obs and intern-

ships at large-scale corpor,ati_ons‘-require 
your most formal dresswear. -   j

A tailored suit is probably your best‘
bet. You are presenting yourself as a pro-
fessional — as someone who comes to
work on time and who is methodical in
their work —— and a suit will best represent
these characteristics.

Men and women should stick to solid
suits of dark blue, black or gray and wear
simple-colored oxford shirts. For women
who want to wear a “statement” piece,
make it something small like a pin, silk
scarf or nice watch. Even consider wearing
a sparkly pair of earrings — but be careful
not to over bling yourself.

In regard to shoes, women need to be
careful to demonstrate that they are prac-
tical and sophisticated. If you’re applying
to a job that requires signiﬁcant action,
don’t prance into your interview with sti-
letto heels. Instead, wear a more conserva-
tive pair of flats that demonstrate maturity
and ﬂexibility, or at least the ‘ability to
run out of the ofﬁce at a minute’s notice.

Men, however, have less options to turn
their drab outﬁts into a catwalk ensemble.
Choose a decorative tie that helps to ac-
cent your suit color, but stick to classy
choices that don’t set you apart in a bad
way.

But if your interview is for a job cre-
ating art displays or working on graphic
design, your suit may be better suited for
your closet. :_

If you are interviewing for an artsy job
that involves a more hands-on approach
with creative coworkers, then —— while you
still want to look nice — you may be able
to get away with a little more of an eclectic
look. In these situations, a nice pair of
black or gray slacks with a button—down
shirt and cardigan are a good look for the
ladies. Gentlemen can get away with a nice
pair of dress pants or khakis, a long—sleeve
oxford shirts and perhaps a sweater vest.

Consider expressing your creativity
with a bright scarf or jeweled necklace.
Positions that rely on self—expression de-
serve less-reserved interview attire, so
make sure to liven up your wardrobe to
publicly demonstrate "your enthusiasm for
the position.

.But it is important that you still look
professional. No sneakers, no low—cut tops
or miniskirts and nothing too ﬂashy or
ostentatious. And don’t break out your
ﬁve—inch studded heels or glow-in-the-
dark bowtie or your clothes will be raising
more eyebrows than your resumé. No sane
person is going to hiresomeone who comes
in looking like they missed the memo on
where the party is. I

Birds may push their chicks out of the
nest, but some Pitt graduates don’t
want to fly away just yet.

Studies across the country have
been analyzing the migration of college
graduates and determining the percent-
age of those who stay in the town their
college is located in. And Chris Briem,
a regional economist and urban and
regional analyst at Pitt, suggested that
Pittsburgh is doing well at keeping its
children close. .

“Like all ‘college towns,’ many ma-
triculants come from elsewhere in the
county and many leave upon gradu-
ation,” Briem said. “Still, Pittsburgh
has been retaining a greater propor-
tion than might be expected, and today,
some of our recent research shows that
Pittsburgh is one of the most educated
workforces .in the nation,.especially for
younger workers.’’ 1

As jobs increasingly require college
degrees, the Pittsburgh area has the
numbers to back up its highly educated
career force. In 2010, a report pub-
lished by the University Center for So-
cial and Urban Research ranked Pitts-
burgh as the fifth-most educated young
workforce in the United States. The U.S.
Department of Labor recently released
the 2012 unemployment rates by metro-
politan area. Pittsburgh had an average
unemployment rate of 7.2 percent, be-
low the national average of 7.6 percent.

The chances of employment increase
even more for individuals with college

Piﬁsburgh area

The photogenic city of Pittsburgh has been doing a good job of retaining its degree

degrees.

“In 2009, the percentage of workers
in Pittsburgh with a bachelor’s degree
or higher exceeded the U.S. average for
younger age cohorts. For workers aged
25-34 in the Pittsburgh region, 48.1 per-
cent had a bachelor’s degree or higher
in 2009, well above the U.S. average of
34.7 percent,” Briem said.

Part of that ability to retain recent
graduates as workers is a result of the
city itself. Last year, Pittsburgh Mayor

Luke Ravenstahl emailed seniors at

Carnegie Mellon University, the Com-
munity College of Allegheny County,
Point Park University and Pitt urging
them to stay in town.

“Pittsburgh has so much to of-
fer young people, from available jobs
to high quality of life and affordabil-
ity, and I’m happy to remind them that
Pittsburgh has what they need and want
after college,” Ravenstahl had said in a
statement.

There are many reasons to stay. For
one, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s
Liveability Ranking and Overview has
ranked Pittsburgh the “most livable
city” several times, and in 2010, The
Huffington Post declared the Steel City
the No. 2 best city for college graduates.
Wired has called it a “haven for geeks.”

Pitt economics professor Frank Giar-
ratani, a colleague of Briem, explained
how regional economics is studied.

“One can approach this subject from
the perspective of urban studies, re-
gional planning, economic geography

Job growth fuels optimism
about US recovery

Jim Puzzanghera
‘ Los Angeles Times (M CT Campus)

WASHINGTON — Fears of a recession
seemed to evaporate as the nation added
157,000 net jobs last month and other key
economic data improved, boosting major
stocks to their highest level in more than
ﬁve years.

Economists and investors were heart-
ened by the Labor Department’s jobs re-
port Feb. 1, which suggested that growth
accelerated at the end of last year.

The new economic readings — a mix
of federaland private data —— contrasted
with aJan. 30 government report that the
economy contracted at a 0.1 percent an-
nual rate in the last three months of 2012.

The January jobs report, which also
showed the unemployment rate ticked up
to 7.9 percent, came in slightly below ana-
lyst expectations. But revised job growth
ﬁgures dating to early 2011 triggered a
surge of optimism that the recovery had
not veered off track. .

“The economy’s the little engine that
could,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives
strategist for TD Ameritrade. “It’s slowly
climbing.”

The Dow Jones industrial average
shot up nearly 150 points, closing above
14,000 for the ﬁrst time since 2007. The
White House touted the 35th—straight
month of private-sector job growth.

And analysts pointed to sharp upward
revisions by the Labor Department of
previous job creation, particularly in the
ﬁnal three months of last year, as proof

V that the recovery was still moving for-

ward.

The government said there were
422,000 more jobs created than initial-
ly reported for the year that ended last
March,30. And from April through De-
cember, the Labor Department revised
upward its earlier estimates by 225,000
jobs.

’ Altogether, that added nearly 650,000
people to the workforce. The new ﬁgures
mean that, on average, the economy add-

ed 181,000 jobs each month last year, up

from the earlier estimate of 153,000.

In the last three months of the year,
the economy averaged 201,000 jobs add-
ed, including 247,000 in November and
196,000 in December.

The small shortfall in the fourth quar-
ter’s gross domestic product — the value
of all goods and services produced na-
tionwide — marked the ﬁrst contraction
since the Great Recession, ended in mid-
2009 and raised worries that another
downturn was ahead.

Many economists quickly said the re-
port appeared to be an anomaly driven by
fears of the “ﬁscal cliff,” and last.Friday’s

data gave more credence to that view.

“We had some pretty good job growth
in the fourth quarter,” said Stuart Hoff-
man, chief economist at PNC Financial
Services. “You don’t get that kind of job
growth if the economy is legitimately ﬂat
on its behind.” , .

Still, he described the January jobs re-

port as mediocre.

Analysts had expected that 165,000
jobs would be added to the economy. The
January ﬁgure also looked worse in com-
parison to the revised December ﬁgure.
The unemployment rate rose from 7.8
percent in December.

Last month, the private sector added
166,000 jobs, but overall growth was
pulledgdown by a net loss of 9,000 gov-
ernment jobs, the Labor Department said.

Sectors that showed job gains in Janu- '

ary included retail, construction and
health care, while transportation and
wa.rehousing declined.

“It’s a bit of an underwhelming re-

. port,” said Peter McHenry, an assistant

economics professor at the College of
William and,Mary. “We’ve still got just‘ a
very slow recovery — certainly a. recov-
ery -— but not anything to be really ex-
cited about.” ’ '

2 The construction industry added
28,000 jobs inJanuary. Some economists
had expected more, given the damage in
the Northeast from Superstorm Sandy
last fall-.

L05 Aizgeles Times (MCT Campus)

Have a Facebook profile with
vulgarities or embarrassing content
you shouldn’t have posted? Now there’s
away to clean them up. A ‘

A trio of Kent State University
undergrads have put together the
“SimpleWash” app, formerly known as
FaceWash, which will search through
a user’s Facebook activity and content

T (the service is coming soon to Twitter)

for items that the user might want to
hide or delete. This could include status
updates, photo captions and comments
users left or received, as well as pages
and links that have been liked.

“We realized that there’s a lot of.

content that perhaps someone might
not want a future employer to see,”
Daniel Gur, 22, said in late January.

Gur created the app over the course
of a weekend with two friends and
fellow computer science majors from
his school — Camden Fullmer, 21,
and David Steinberg, 24. The three

might encounter minor glitches.

FAIR  

reer Fair preview days from Feb. 12
through 15, in which CDPA will have
free giveaways and food and will host
several employers from all industries.
According to Finlay, employers who at-
tend the preview days will be reviewing
student resumés before the fair and giv-
ing students tips for improving them.
Career Services also has additional
resources on its website, including vid-
eos about how to prepare for the Career
Fair and a document detailing what to
do before, during and after the fair.
Students can also access the Pitt Career
Network, through which students can

search and contact Pitt alumni who are ’

willing to give advice and explore dif-
ferent career fields and network.

Once students arrive at the Union
on the day of the Career Fair, they will
be able to register at the lobby, receive
their nametag and pick up a copy of an
event map.

“It is important for students to dress
in professional attire, bring plenty of
copies of your resume and network with
employers to learn more about the op-

zation,” Finlay said.

Finlay said that Career Services is of-
fering a “Final Pitt Stop” for last min-
ute touch—ups. This will belocated in
the lobby ofthe Union, where students
will find basic needs such as shirts,
ties, scarves, hairspray and makeup.
Finlay encourages students to stop by
the CDPA office beforehand for advice
regarding specific attire for their inter-
view.

Career consultant Jessica Rizk sug-

_ gests that students prepare their busi-

ness outﬁt before the fair to make sure
it’s comfortable and appropriate.
Senior Emily Plazek has attended
multiple careers fairs at Pitt, and she
has developed an arsenal of tips for stu-
dents.
Plazek emphasizes that dress is more

A important than students think and that

it is an important and contributing fac-

‘tor to an employer-’s first impressions.

She urges men to wear suits and women

‘ to dressconservatively.

“Dress to impress,” shepsaid, adding
that it doesn’t.hurt to add a pop of color
or something eye—catching, such as jew-

.e1ry, to help distinguish yourself.

‘Ritz advises students who come with

friends to not travel in packs. It’s im-
portant for the employer to see you in a
professional setting.

As for the resume, Plazek suggested
that students print their resume on
quality paper, which shows employers
they went the extra step.

Plazek also explains the importance
of preparing the “elevator speech” or .
the quick introduction of who you are, '
what you’re doing at pitt, why you’re
talking to them and what you’re in'ter- V
ested in.

“By having this prepared and prac-
ticed, it makes it really easy to just walk
up to the employer and to be confident,
which goes a long way,” Plazek said. I

As CDPA adds more internship op-

all available internships to students par-

UNDEREMPLOYED

Despite working multiple part-time-

minimum-wage jobs, Sonnet said that his
situation does have some positives. The
jobs allow him to pay his bills and keep

. busy before he enters grad school and

continues to work in the realm of aca-
demia. ,

“I know the next four to six years of
my life will be Very hard academic work,
and this is a good break to refresh after a
busy last semester as an undergraduate,”
he said. .

' Other graduates who choose not to
pursue further educational opportunities
accept,minimum—wage jobs while search-
ing for something more permanent.

Sarah Reagle, who graduated from Pitt

I with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Litera-

ture and Art History in April 2012, agreed
that working a minimum-wage job gives
hervtime to do things that she may not
have if she had started a different job im-
mediately after graduation. Since gradu-
ating, Reagle has spent time building a
professional website, managing a blog,
learning to knit and trying hobbies that
she put off during her schooling.

“Once I start a career, I don’t think I’ll
have this kindiof time, so I take advantage
of it,” she-said. “Having this time to my-
self also lets me think about what I do and
don’t want in a job. I have a much clearer

picture of where my professional inter-.

ests really lie than when I graduated.”
Reagle currently works part-time at

I Apple Castle, a produce market on an

apple orchard in New Wilmington, Pa.,

I and is saving money to move away from

home once she has secured a job. Shesaid
that she constantly applies for jobs, typi-
cally in various publishing positions; and

’ is aware that she is currently in a “transi-

tional moment.”

“My main goal» is to do something that
I enjoy, and I’d preferably. like to be writ-

said in an email.

In the email, he also added, “Only about
80,000 engineers are graduated each year,
and demand for engineering skills exceeds
this number, which is why engineers are
placed at high rates (95 percent would be
typical) and at high salaries ($50,000 to
$90,000 for BS degrees).”

He went on to say that graduating engi—
neers often get multiple job offers and, as a
result, have to turn some down. He added
that in this slower economy multiple offers
are less frequent but do still exist and are
not uncommon.

Morisi said students should note that .

this outlook for all listed jobs are for the
upcoming 10-year period.

A glimmer of hope can be found, de-
spite the state of the economy. Allegheny
County has a 6.6 percent unemployment
rate, putting it below the national aver-
age of 7.8 percent. This makes it one of the
strongest performing counties in Pennsyl-
vania in terms of unemployment rates.

As of December 2012, the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics reports that there are
18,400 people employed in Pittsburgh in
the category of architecture, engineer-
ing and related services. The health care
industry statistics reﬂect similar success,
with 253,500 people employed under it as

ofDecernber 2012. I The demand for engineering positions is high in the current job market. MCT Campus

ing doesn’t have to be your job forever,
and I don’t want to stress myself out by
pigeonholing my options,” Reagle said.

Sonnet agreed with Reagle, saying
that people should consider paying the
high price for a college education when
they are forced to keep an “open mind”
upon graduation.

“I believe that too many people are
going to universities,” Sonnet said. “It’s
very good to have an educated populous,
but the cost of schooling combined with
the jobs that people get out of school and

the jobs the school trains them for does
not equal out.” '.

Sonnet said he has discussed paying
off loans with friends and it is difﬁcult
for him to argue for less people to focus
on college degrees because he plans to
stay in post—education institutions as a
career.

eral Reserve Bank of New York injuly, the

mortgage loans.

But to effectively combat loans, grad-
uates must first secure jobs. A A '

Reagle said that applying to jobs out-
side of this area poses an additional
challenge when searching for a job and
attempting to balance out the cost of a
recent degree.

“I like to think that a lot of my prob-
lem is living at home north of Pittsburgh,
and the jobs I apply to are in Chicago or
New York or other faraway places,” Rea-
gle said. “I think it’s hard for employers
to want to hire a recent college gradu-
ate for an entry—level job from afar when
there are other recent graduates apply-
ing for the same jobs from that area.”

With or without a job, living situations
are another consideration post—bache-
lor’s degree. Sonnet said that his job at
The Book Center helps support living ex-
penses, and Reagle chose to move back
home. This decision, Reagle said, does
not bother her. V

“I get along well with my family, and
it’s a lot easier to save money for a move
when I don’t have to worry about pay-
ing rent every month. It’s certainly not
a path for everyone, and it’s not a path I
want to stay on for much longer, but it’s
nice for now,” she said.

Malay Shah graduated from Pitt in
May 2010 with a Bachelor of Science De-
gree in material science engineering and
now works for Westinghouse Electric Co.
in Cranberry. While he is not underem-
ployed, Shah said in retrospect that if
he faced a minimum-wage job following
graduation, he would have chosen to turn
it down.

Instead, Shah, who said he was initial-
ly concerned about ﬁnding a job, had the
secure fallback plan to return home and
job hunt to avoid getting caught in a job
unrelated to his degree.

“I definitely was worried because the
market had just tanked and I knew a lot
of people from my year who were still
looking for job placements,” Shah said.
“My parents always gave me the option to
move back home, so if things had worked
out differently, I believe that I would’ve
lived with them and continued my job
search.” I

If he had not gotten a job, Shah said

that he would have been more open to a,

variety of location changes — something
that several students he knew didnot
want.

Sonnet, who said that he wished he
had established more connections and
applied for more internships while in
school, suggested that students who pur-
sue degrees in engineering should co-
op and gain work experience to “make
[themselves] valuable” and liberal arts
majors should begin interning or com-
pleting part—time work that they would
like to pursue after graduation. Students,

_he argued, must put themselves in the

position to get non-minimum-wage jobs.

“It is on you. College will not hand you
a job, you have to actively pursue it as a 19
[or] 20 year old,” he said. I

with people who have different home-
towns, different ethnic and racial
make-ups, different sexual orientations
and different political beliefs, and we
are constantly undergoing socialization
to appreciate and be considerate of our
differences on these planes.

But what about older people‘? There
might be the occasional undergraduate
who is a few years older, but in general,
most of the relationships we develop
with adults will not be built the same
way as our relationships with fellow
students. Be it in the lab or in the lec-

ture hall, our adult relationships tend _

to have a distinct mentor—mentee qual-
ity. We rarely communicate as equals.
It’s unfortunate for us that our di-
versity training overlooks this relation-
ghip. When we embark into the world in
a couple of months or years, the most

generational differences. The differ-

clear method of fostering group co-.

hesion is informality. Most studies of
workplace behavior show. that this is
one of our most identifying traits as a
generation. When we start group proj-
ects, it is rarely with a strong declara-
tion separating work from play. We
instead prefer a low—key approach,
shifting in and out of weekend-plan
discussion, rotating focus between the
project at hand and our iPhones.

It turns out that this quality is the
opposite of what is expected out of
many workers above the age of 40. Baby
Boomers are notable for a direct, en-
ergetic and focused method of work.
Many sacrificed family lives for their

careers, a choice less likely to be made
by workers in younger generations.
They take their work seriously. '

This difference might seem super-
ficial. Who cares if work styles differ?
The product should be what matters.

But in reality, employers have far
more subjective information about
workers than objective information
about results. So if an employer is go-
ing to judge work poorly because of
these subjective characteristics, it’s the
job of the worker to try to better match
expectations. To achieve any kind of
emotional connection with your co-
workers, some acknowledgement and

adjustment to this new work behavior‘

will be necessary. ,
That’s_not to say you should act like a

it 50-year-old man or woman. Companies
' need new ideas and fresh energy. The

informal work style has advantages as
well, be it in forming wider work rela-
tionships or in creating tighter employ-
ee bonds. _
But don’t be blind to differences.
Insensitivity to cultural differences re-
garding age will destroy your career,

possibly faster than cultural differenc— "

es along other traits. Don’t let a Disney
Channel understanding of older work-
ers stop your success. I

Could communication problems be
leading to our declining value to com-

I think it is a good possibility. Hav-

ing worked in various capacities at dif— ‘

ferent organizations, it is clear that
work styles between generations are
very different. Since older workers
tend to be the ones deciding wages and
making hiring decisions, if a workrstyle

tion is perceivedasi poor behavior in
the eyes of older workers, they should
be expected to judge our performance
poorly. Wages and job offers would sub-
sequently decline.

But this is not an ideal world. Dive in

 head ﬁrst, seniors. Here we go.

Put yourself out there. If your par-
ents’ neighbor seems like someone with
a decent job, ask if there’s any entry-
level opening they know of. Offer a copy
of your resume. If they don’t know of
anything, they might know someone

 who does. Begin the chain reaction.

Make yourself available. You might
want to spend your summer at Hem’s
with your friends, living it up immedi-
ately after graduation. That might not
be the best idea. Be willing to do some-

thing different, even if it may be social-
ly crippling.

Spell check your resume and stan-
dard cover letters. Assuming you have
them already typed and at the ready,
glancing over them again can’t hurt. You
will always look like a fool if you have a
basic grammar mistake, like the wrong
form of “your” or ‘,‘their.’"’ You’re in your
early twenties now, time to learn how to
spell.

This is the only advice I can_ offer.
These are logical words to the wise.
But I don’t know what works. I’m in the
same boat. This is just the logic speak-
ing. Perhaps there is a secret guide that
I don’t know about.

If I ﬁgure it out, I’d be gladto write.

that guide and teach “Intro to the Real
World.”

I wish the best of luck to my fellow
graduating Panthers as we enter the
workforce. We have to keep our heads
up: It could be a long and bumpy ride
once May is here. It’s time to prepare.
Shamelessly promote yourself. You nev-
er know where it’l_l end up.

Maybe we should all just storm the

control. A positive online presence is
composed of positive content, or material
you want potential employers to see. Ser-
vices like Weebly.com allow you to create
and host professional-looking websites
and portfolios without any programming
knowledge. Sites like Wordpress.org
can be used to create a thoughtful blog
related to your intended ﬁeld, perhaps
even catching the attention of people in
the industry. LinkedIn.com is a fantastic
and increasingly necessary way to be-
come visible to potential employers and
to network with other professionals. Give
hiring" managers sdmething to read when
they Google you.‘

Your online presence is an ongoing
commitment. Once you’ve taken down
keg stand photos from freshman year
and gotten glowing recommendations for
your LinkedIn proﬁle, you’ll ‘need to mon-
itor search results to ensure your digital
footprint remains both accurate and fa-
vorable. Instead of Googling your name
periodically, set up a Google Alert with
your name in quotes as the search query.
This free service will send you an email
update whenever a new search result
related to your name appears. Unfortu-
nately, having a very common name will
produce more unrelated alert messages.

While ﬁltering your online output,
creating positive content and monitor-
ing your search results can save you a lot
of headache, keep in mind that having a
large amount of personal information
available online also has the potential to
cause you great harm. There’s a privacy
trade-off to advertising and visibility:
Identity thieves thrive on publically avail-
able information. Common sense can
help minimize a portion of the risk, but

%. some loss of privacy is unavoidable when

living in an Internet-connected world.
It’s becoming increasingly unfeasible to
not leave a digital footprint, particularly

. when job huntinglalmost demands it. Un-

less you plan on forsaking all social me-

 dia —~ in which case someone who shares

your name will likely be mistaken for you
—— there is no choice but to accept the pri-
vacy trade—off.

Regardless of potential privacy prob— V

lems, creating and maintaining a favor-
able and visible onlinelimage is critical
to job—hunting success. And doing so re-
quires more than just eliminating poten-
tially harmful content; it means actively
creating potentially beneﬁcial content
and monitoring your search results. Like
it or not, the rise of social media means
you’re living in a glass box, so take control
of your online image now. I

The reason is that we get so many appli-
cants, and we have to be able to draw the
line somewhere. For full-time positions
there might not be GPA_,cutoffs per se.
What companies want to see is that you
not only can handle school but that you
were involved in other things. So GPA is
very important: It shows that you can
handle school life, other activities, a
balanced lifestyle and that you’re intel-
ligent. But usually only for set programs
is there a GPA requirement.

Q: What are some mistakes you’ve
seen candidates make when interview-
ing in-person or over the phone?

A: One is being too casual. My inter-
view style is a conversation -— I don’t
like to intimidate people or make them
feel nervous, but sometimes people
take that too far and become very ca-
sual, very lax in their language and use
slang. It’s important to stay extremely
professional because you are interview-
ing with your superiors. I think another
mistake people make is not thoroughly
answering questions. When we ask a
question, whether-it’s a technical or a
behavioral or a situational question, we
want to see the full picture: a little bit of
background on that example, what your
role was, what you did and how it was
resolved. An easy way to remember that
is STAR. S is situation, again the back-
ground, T is task, what your role was, A
is action, what happened, what you did
and R is the result. Lacking profession-
alism and completeness in answers are
the two biggest mistakes I’ve seen can-
didates make.

Q: When a student is looking for that
first professional position, how should
an employer or opportunity be evalu-
ated?

A: I think it starts with that first in-
teraction, and hopefully it’s reflective
of the company. At U'PMC, for example,
we have a very open, warm environ-
ment. I try to portray that friendly,
warm demeanor every time I interact

V with students. After a student interacts

with a company, maybe it was too for-
mal for them, or maybe it was too ca-
sual for them or maybe the work itself
didn’t interest them. That’s a sign. Ev-

ery business has its own culture. I think .

a student should evaluate that and ask
questions about the culture and the en-
vironment that they would work in. Also
think about the future. As a recruiter, I’d
rather see an unpaid internship with a
small marketing firm doing the exact
kind of work that you want to be do-
ing at UPMC rather than a position at
a huge company where all you did was
make coffee and get copies. A smaller
unpaid experience can give you a lot

lmoreto talk about, so students should

evaluate the work that they’re going to
be doing and how it lines up with their

future goals.

Q: You have experience in the devel-
opment of undergraduate interns. What
can a student do to succeed during an
internship and receive a full-time offer?

A: It’s first and foremost working
hard every day. Internships are usually
10 to 13 weeks over the summer, that’s
a 10 to 13-week interview: a chance for
you to interview the company and for
the company to interview you. So do ev-
erything you can, 120 percent, making
sure it’s as perfect as possible, making
sure you’re thinking one step beyond.
Do what you’re asked to do well, but
also think about what else you could do

to help with a process. Second, make it
known. A manager might think you’re
doing a really great job and really like
you but not know that you want to be
hired full time. Talk about that at some
point. Maybe not your first week, but let
them know that you’d like to come back
full time if there’s a position open. Fi-
nally, do some research. Companies are
more than willing to help you if you’re
willing to help yourself. Know what
types of positions in the organization
would be a good fit for you in case there
isn’t an opening on the team you’re in-
terning with.

Q: Is there any other advice you would

like to give to current students or recent

graduates looking for employment?‘ 9
A: It’s never too early to‘_look. We love

when freshmen come to talk to us. We

can keep in contact with them for four _
years, hopefully get them to intern with

us at least once and hire them full time.
You can never network enough, you nev-
er know what doors are going to open up
in the future. Never burn a bridge with
that recruiter or that manager because
you never know when it’s going to circle
back around. Those are my two biggest
pieces of advice. It all comes down to
networking: It’s never too ‘early to start,
and you can never network enough. I

Briem elaborated on Giarratani’s
idea, adding that Pitt’s University Cen-
ter for Social and Urban Research cre-
ates and maintains economic models

from demographic and residential
planning to economic impact.

staying depended on the town’s size.

bac experience,” Abdelghani said.

Among her reasons for staying, Ab-
delghani listed the proximity of her
family and friends in Pittsburgh, living
at home during her college experience
and the cost of living in the city com-
pared to the type of lifestyle that it af-
fords.

It appears that other students are

But the increase was “validation the
housing market continues to gain mo-
mentum,” said Diane Swonk, chief econo-
mist at Mesirow Financial.;_

Sincebottoming out in January2011

‘after the housing collapse, the construc-
tion industry“has added 296,000 jobs,
the Labor Department said. One-third of
that gain came in the past four months.

A “A quarter ago, you’d say the housing
market had stabilized,” TD Ameritr-'ade’s

V Kinahan said.’ “Now you can say the hous-
ing market is starting to grow.”

In another positive sign for the sector,
the Commerce Department said last Fri-
day that construction spending increased
0.9 percent in December from the previ-
ous month to an annual rate of $885 bil-

lion. ‘

The manufacturing sector expanded
injanuary for the second—straight month,
the Institute for Supply Management
said. Jobs in the manufacturing sector
have shown little changesince the sum-
mer, the Labor Department said.

And consumer conﬁdence also im-
proved slightly last month after Washing-
ton policymakers avoided most of the tax
increases slated to kick inJan. 1 as part of
the “ﬁscal cliff.”

 
 

“The labor market
is heaHng, but 
unevenly.”

Diane Swonk

The closely watched consumer senti-
ment index from Thomson Reuters and
the University of ‘Michigan rose to 73.8
in January from 72.9 the previous month.

— the expiration of the two-year payroll.

dence, said Richard Curtin, the survey’s

economists said.

More potential problems are loom-
ing as Congress must deal with large au-
tomatic spending cuts set to hit March
1. And another battle over the nation’s
debtlimit. could be coming this summer
after Congress approved‘ a temporary in-
crease to avoid a potential showdown this
month. " . ’ .

,Swonk said such “fiscal land mines”
could derail the recovery. A

And Alan Krueger, chairman of the

White House Council of Economic Advi-
. sors, warned that the jobs report showed

Still, he said, the report was “further
evidence that the U.S. economy is con-

However, House Speakerjohn Boehner

POVERTY

In order to achieve this level of success,
Aubin said, two areas in particular need to
be improved within impoverished nations:
the status of women and “smart” foreign
investment.

“No other policy [than empowering
women] is more powerful for increasing
education in the next generation,” Aubin
said, quoting former United Nations Sec-
retary-General Koﬁ Annan. “And I’d also
venture that no policy islmore effective for
achieving reconciliation once conﬂict has
ended.”

Aubin said that “smart” foreign invest-

ments include those in agriculture, health
care and business — particularly when
these investments include training for the
citizens. Foreign investment of this nature
allows individual communities to control
the allocation of resources. “Bad” invest-
ment, she said, includes plentiful items
such as clothing.

Aubin also said that many American citi-

zens were already wary about government

expenditures on foreign aid. But, she add-
ed, this spending amounted to only 1 per-
cent of the federal budget.

Senior Amanda Webb, a molecular biology
major who attended the event, said the
small amount of foreign aid from coun-
tries such as the U.S. wasthe most striking
point made by Aubin during the entire pre-

sentation.

“There’s a concept of distribution of wealth
and saying that you can’t help everyone. I
think that the statistics in particular show
that our distribution is kind of ridiculous
and that we can deﬁnitely redistribute a
lot of our funding to better causes,” Webb
said. 1

In order to achieve these goals, however,
Aubin said governmental corruption in de-
veloping nations needs to be curbed. One
of the main issues she emphasized was the
low wages for civil servants in impover-
ished nations. She said most civil servants
in developing countries earn about $30 a
month, which makes them more likely to
engage in corruption.

“Corruption doesn’t just affect people from

abroad. It affects all of us,” Aubin said.
Once corruption is curbed, Aubin said,
nations must focus on establishing trade.
But, she said, this requires a government
committed to establishing infrastructure,
creating credit markets and establishing a
public education system. L

Many of the event’s attendees were mem-
bers of Pitt philanthropy groups such as
Habitat for Humanity. Junior Abby Rolli-
son, a neuroscience major and a member
of Pitt’s Habitat for Humanity group, said
the lessons learned from Aubin’s presenta-
tion could also be applied in Pittsburgh.

“I think education is a really important
ﬁrst step, just becoming aware of home-
lessness in your own town and yourcom—
munity,” Rollison said. “It’s hard because
we’re in the United States and especially

’ here in college.” ‘

Aubin encouraged the presentation’s at-
tendees to participate in a program pro-
moted by the Global Poverty Project called
“Live Below the Line,” in which partici-
pants spend only $1.50 or less on food and
drink a day for ﬁve days.

She added that experiences such as these

can motivate ordinary people to strive for ’

an end to world poverty -—— a goal she said
could be reached within the next genera-
-tion. ,
“It’s going to take everyday people like
you and me making small changes. Little
things that are going to have a huge impact
‘on extreme poverty,” Aubin said. I

were so many Deltas there. It was unbeliev-
able,” Hicks said. “Even [President Barack]
Obama congratulated us for making 100
years and congratulated us for our com-
mitment.” ‘

Harper said that the events in D.C. were ,

life—changing. ‘

On Monday, Jan. 14, after returning
from Washington, the Deltas had their own
centennial celebration at the O’Hara Stu-
dent Center on Pitt’s campus. The event,
open to the public, also drew Deltas from
Carnegie Mellon University and alumni
from the Pitt chapter.

Deltas in attendance dressed in their
colors of crimson and cream asthey lis-
tened to Allen speak about the sorority’s
centennial.

Since its founding, Delta Sigma Theta

membership has grown to over 200,000 .

predominantly African-American college-
educated women, with members in Japan,
Germany and the Virgin Islands. Accord-

ing to Sherdina Hicks, there are more than‘

900 chapters of the sorority.

Humphrey said that being a Delta

rican—American culture. J

“Deltas greet each other no matter
where you, are — it’s your connection and
responsibility to that woman if she is a, Del-
ta. It’s not just a piece of your life, but a part
of the entire culture,” Humphrey said. '

Yvette Moore, a Delta and academic
counselor for Pitt’s Swanson School of En-
gineering, described what Deltas stand for.

“We’re ﬁghters. We want to do some-
thing and make things better,” she said.

Humphrey agreed by saying when
learning to be a Delta, one must embody
the true principles.

“We have a responsibility to our organi-
zation, but we have a greater responsibility
to our community and our world,” Hum-
phrey said. '

In March, the Deltas will be traveling
back to D.C. to reenact the women’s suf-
frage march down Pennsylvania Avenue. I

speciﬁcally rebounding—wise. That’s
what we knew we had to improve on
at the time, and beforehand and ever
since,” he said.

That improvement has lent the team
its best year defensively in school his-
tory, with the Panthers allowing 54.5
points per game — nearly two points
better than the second-best season,
during which Pitt allowed 56.4 points
per game in 2003-2004.

In its last seven games, Pitt has out-
rebounded every opponent except for
Providence, which tied the Panthers
with 30 rebounds.

What should cause problems for
Cincinnati will be the much—publicized
10-man rotation Dixon has used this
season, with L]. Moore playing a‘key
role off the bench. Moore ranks fourth
on the team inscoring at 8.6 points per
game. -

against Cincinnati should pay divi-
dends when the Panthers travel to the

Fifth Third Arena on Saturday.

“I think it’s good and to our advan-
tage,” Moore said. “We know how they
play now, and we’re just going to go
out there and compete harder than we

did when they came in here, and they

played harder than us  Now we’re
ready for it, mentally prepared and
physically prepared.” '

A part of becoming more prepared
for Cincinnati will be the “spark” that
Moore and others such as Dante Taylor
and Cam Wright bring off the bench.

“Everybody on the bench is giving
good minutes,” Moore said. “We un-

derstand our roles, and we understand
what’s going on, and we’re going to go
out there and play hard.” -

For Dixon, Moore’s most crucial as-
set to the team is the energy he brings
to the defensive side. _ '

“I think he’s been a big part of our
improvement defensively,” Dixon said.
“You can see the energy he playswith.”

Entering the game, Woodall is just

11 points away from becoming the 40th
Panther to eclipse the 1,000-point
threshold. But for the redshirt senior,
his individual performance doesn’t
hold a _candle to the importance of a
Panther victory this weekend.

“IfI score 11 points in Cincinnati and
we get the win, the individual records
don’t really matter.” Woodall said. “We
know exactly what we’re gonna get.” I

With a four-game winning streak
in hand, the Hoyas should be able to
stretch their streak to five games with
a matchup against Rutgers on Saturday.
Georgetown will need all the momen-

' turn it can get when John Thompson III’s

squad faces Marquette on Monday.

Notre Dame took advantage of its
three—game stretch against South Flor-

into a wall at Syracuse when they lost by
16 points. After the team plays Louisville
on Saturday, Notre Dame should have

8. St. John’s (15-8, 7-4)

Yet another team within a game of
holding the ﬁrst—place spot in the con-
ference, the Red Storm rebounded from
a loss against Georgetown with a solid
victory over Connecticut. In its last
seven games, St. John’s is 6-1 and ap-
pears primed to make _a run at one of the
Big East tournament’s fou-r double—bye
seeds.

9. Connecticut (15-6, 5-4)

In its lost season — the team is post-
season-ineligible because of NCAA in-
fractions ‘— the Huskies still show as
much fight as any one of Jim Calhoun’s
teams _did. Now under the supervision
of coach Kevin Ollie, UConn’s tradition
of strong guard play continues with Sha-
bazz Napier, Ryan Boatrightvand Omar
Calhoun, who combine to average almost
44 points per game. _

10. Providence (12-11, 4-7)

The Friars most likely will not be con-
tending for any of the conference’s top
seeds when the Big East Tournament
rolls around, but Providence picked up

two signature wins against Cincinnati on ‘

Wednesday and Villanova a weelcearlier.
Bryce Cotton continues to lead the con-
ference in scoring at nearly 21 points per
game.

11. Villanova (14—9, 5-5)

Jay Wright’s Wildcats furthered their
Jekyl1—and-Hyde reputation by losing to
Providence on Saturday. Again, this isa
team that beat both Syracuse and Louis-
ville in the same week earlier this season.

12. Rutgers .(12-9, 3-7)

Rutgers continues to slide, now hold-
ing a ﬁve-game losing streak in confer-

ence play. Rutgers will have the chance f

to retire from its losing track in the com-
ing week with games against Seton Hall
and DePaul, but those games come after
a matchup with No. 20 Georgetown on

in the conference, but that’s a small vic-
tory — about as small as the Blue De-

son before its current seven-game losing ,
