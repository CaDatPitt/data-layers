If David Souter is confirmed as a Supreme Court
justice, the country will watch reproductive rights
go down the drain, according to Molly Yard,
president of the National Organization for Women.

“We will tremble for the Bill of Rights and [about]
discrimination against all minorities and women,”
Yard told a crowd at Pitt's law school on Thursday.

NOW has declared a national emergency week
in response to the Souter nomination.

“We have only done that once before in our

Yard came to Pitt as part of the Campus Caravan,
a project that has been traveling across the country
for over a year to urge young people to organize
themselves to fight for their reproductive rights.

“Basically the whole reason for the Campus
Caravan is to get young people excited, get them
organized, get them open to feminist campaigns,
local campaigns, statewide campaigns that build a
whole avalanche of students that [will speak out on
the Souter nominationl,” said NOW’s national vice
president Rosemary Zempsey.

“We are doing everything we know how to stop
this confirmation of David Souter because we
believe that he will be the ﬁfth [vote needed on the

But we think that_this is an emergency because

SGB plans to investigate Book Center

By Randy Legersky
Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
is fed up with the policies of the
University Book Center.

“The University Book Center
upholds policies that are
financially detrimental to students,
and we intend to investigate the
following policies: the mark—up
on the wholesale price of books
for an apparently non-profit
organization, and the resale policy
in which students receive a small
amount per text. The Book Center
turns around and charges the
next student nearly 100 percent
of the listed worth. And the long
lines and wait time that students
come across at the beginning of
the semester when buying their
books,” said SGB member Mike
Golden.

Golden and SGB member Jay
Gervasoni told last week’s
meeting of the SGB that they plan
to meet with Mary Bonach,
director of Book Centers, to

express their concerns.

“If we don’t get anything
accomplished at our meeting
about the book buy-back policy
[...], then I am not opposed to us
opening our own bookstore, ” said
Golden.

The SGB also discussed campus
safety problems. SGB President
Julie Shepard said she has
received a letter on that issue
from Luis Tronzo, assistant to Pitt
President Wesley Posvar and
director of federal and local
relations.

“Mr. Tronzo’s letter talked about
the vendor right in front of the
Union and different safety
hazards, as well as some of the
problems that he sees with traffic
signals at various intersections in
Oakland. “

Shepard said her concern was
“concentrated mostly on the
intersection at Fifth and Bellefield
avenues where the accident
occurred not too long ago,
suggesting that perhaps a walk/
don’t—walk sign be installed there,

or at least the timing of those
lights be extended.”

In other business:

-Shepard said she spoke to
Mark Galzerano, SGB lawyer,
about a workshop discussing
leasing apartments from a legal

standpoint.

The workshop would cover
“things that you should look out
for before you sign a lease,” said
Shepard.

-The SGB announced two
upcoming conferences. The first,
on campus violence,will be held
Oct.3 at Robert Morris College.
On Oct. 26, a Combating Racism
conference will be held at the
Rodef Shalom Temple.

Pitt opens CHMR training facility

By Jennifer Skriba
For The Pitt News

Pennsylvania ranks first in the
nation in the number of accidents
involving hazardous materials.
Last year 38 incidents occurred
involving railroad derailments and
chemical spills.

The University of Pittsburgh, in
cooperation with the state and
local governments and private
enterprise, has created a
partnership in an effort to
minimize the effects of these
incidents through simulation
training.

Keynote speaker Gov. Robert
Casey dedicated the expansion
of the Center for Hazardous
Materials Research worker-
training complex at a ribbon
cutting ceremony on Friday in
Harmarville.

“Our entire state will benefit
from this training center because
it is dedicated to a goal that all of
us share — the protection of the
health and safety of our families,”
said Casey.

The training—center staff
instructs hazardous—waste
workers through both classroom
learning and simulation training.
The basic focus of the program is
to learn how to respond safely
and efficiently in emergency
situations.

State Sen. D. Michael Fisher, a
leading spokesperson on
environmental issues in the
Pennsylvania legislature, said,
“Training and education have
been the foundation of the CHMR
program."

On the site, trainees must react
to a highway tanker-truck spill,
toxic— waste—dump handling and

cleanup, a railroad chemical-car
derailment and a workplace,
factory or plant accident. Very
few facilities across the country
have the capability to simulate all
four incidents, according to Edgar
Berkey, president of CHMR.
“We have become one of the
largest university-affiliated
organizations in the United Sates

that focuses exclusively on
environmental issues,” said
Berkey.

The training complex is the
newest part of the larger CHMR
training site, which is a non-
profit subsidiary of the University
of Pittsburgh trust.

Since training began at the site
in 1987, over 3,000 individuals
have completed the program.

Students protest
pro-choice leader

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Stop the Molly folly.
Equal rights for unborn women.
Molly Yard, you don ‘I speak for me.

Holding signs bearing these and other slogans, approximately
20 University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University pro-
life students protested National Organization for Women
President Molly Yard’s speech Thursday in the Law School
Building.

On one sign, Yard’s name was written in dripping red paint
to simulate blood.

Robert Chesnavich, a CMU student, was protesting “Molly's
crusades to stop [Supreme Court nominee David] Souter and
[making] abortion legal.”

Pitt_r_Students for Life Vice President Sheila Wusinich said,
“We’re here to show that Molly Yard doesn’t speak for all
women."

“We’re here to speak for pre—born women and all the women
who are exploited by abortion,” she said.

CMU student Jeff Mishler said that he and his friends Mark
Sanders and Joe Messina, also CMU students, came to Pitt to
protest Yard’s speech because “We’re basically just pro-lifer
Catholic guys.”

Yard’s views are against their religious and moral principles,
he said.

“I came down here because Molly is irrational," Messina said.

“I don't see how these people can go around saying [abortion]
is right when it’s not,” Sanders said.

FAS dean works for more faculty support

By Margaret Swisher
For The Pitt News

With a slight German accent,
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Peter Koehler tells how the
university did the unconventional
by hiring him four years ago.

Before arriving at Pitt, Koehler
was a scientist for 13 years at the
Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Chicago.

The laboratory was a research
facility for professors, including
University of Pittsburgh
professors.

“They convinced me that I
should take up this challenge,”
Koehler said. “And I saw this as
an opportunity to work with a
really top-notch faculty.”

Kathy Linduff, associate dean
for academic affairs and professor
of art history, said that Koehler
learned very quickly the many
aspects of the position which
includes the curriculum, graduate-
student training and faculty
support.

“He is certainly able to

encourage the administration,”
Linduff said. “He tried to make it
possible for the budget to be a
more open process and more
appropriate to the needs of
Faculty Arts and Sciences."

Koehler is responsible for
allocating a $55 million budget to
31 departments, 21
interdisciplinary chairs and
programs for faculty recruitment

Koehler explained how with
the right resources, the faculty
could wake up to its fullest
potential.

“You have a car; why don’t you
put gas in it?" Koehler asked. “We
can get a lot more mileage by
giving them support, and I argue
with the provost and president to
get them more attention.”

Philip Smith, chairperson of
the English department, the
largest department of arts and
sciences, said that Koehler has
considerably raised the operating
budget and supported many
departments in their efforts to do
a better job.

“Particularly in the English

department, he's been
sympathetic to several
improvements including equity
adjustments in workloads of
teaching assistants and teaching
fellowships,” Smith said. “He has
also increased travel and research
support.”

He has also provided support
for two journals, boundary 2 and
Cinema Journal , said Smith.

Koehler nursed the department
of behavioral neuroscience
through infancy and helped two
new interdisciplinary programs,
intelligence systems and cultural
studies, get started.

But the faculty must answer
more questions to justify their
requests, said Koehler.

“I work harder to get the same
results,” Koehler said. “I am very
sure we use what we have at the
maximal advantage.”

Linduff said by working with
the dean she has learned to ask a
whole different set of questions
to better analyze matters.
“Nobody works harder than the
dean of FAS,” Linduff said. “And

there's nobody who takes it more
seriously.”

Koehler said he is not finished
giving the faculty the support
they need to do their jobs.

Smith also agrees with Koehler.
“He needs not to be dealing
constantly with crisis, ” Smith said.
“He has to be developing FAS’s
excellence, rather than finding
ways to pay the bills."

He would also like to spend
more time on fundraising.
“Alumni take a very definite
interest," Koehler said. “I want
them to put their money where
their mouth is.”

Already the search has begun
for a new university president,
and Koehler said that the qualified
individual would have to
appreciate the academic values
which the University of Pittsburgh
represents.

“The president must have the
administrative skills [to set
prioritiesl,” Koehler said. “But the
university president's chief duty
is to be a fundraiser; without that,
the person will be incomplete.”

Students lounge around while waiting for dorm rooms

By Brenda Lanzendorfer‘
The Pitt News

It happens every year, and the -

Housing Office has no plans of
changing.

Each year television lounges
are converted into dorm rooms
for four people ~— four beds, four
desks, four dressers and even
four wardrobes. Students are
assigned housing in the Litchﬁeld
Towers’ lounges because there is
simply no other place to put
them, but according to Leslie
Paul of the Housing Office, the
situation is only temporary.

“The students will be out by
the end of the term,” said Paul.

Students will be moved out of
the lounges one at a time as
rooms become available around
campus. The only way a room
can be considered “available” is
if the present occupant either
drops out, transfers or decides to
live off campus.

There is a long waiting list for
students wanting on-campus
housing, said Paul, but those in
the lounges are considered first
priority. According to Paul, some
students have already been
relocated to permanent housing,
but most are waiting for word of
openings.

When asked what they thought
of the entire situation, those living
in the lounges -had many different
opinions.

According to Kristie Messner

from Tower B’s 21st floor, "We
love it here.” Messner and her
three roommates get along well.

Most of those residing in the
lounges agree the room is quite
large enough to accommodate
four people. In fact, said Eric
Christie of the 12th-ﬂoor lounge,

“It’s so big  we [can] play soccer. ” I

Another advantage for these
students is the cost of the quad,
which amounts to at least $300
less than a Towers’ double.

However, many students in the
lounges are finding the money
they save doesn’t compensate for
the many drawbacks involved.

The women on the 21st ﬂoor of
Tower B are enjoying their three-
roommate experience, but
Christie and his roommates nine
ﬂoors down are not faring so
well. .

“There are too many kids, and
we don’t get along at all,” said
Christie.

He also mentioned the difficulty
in ﬁnding a quiet time to study.
He must constantly battle the
noise of three other people, not
to mention the commotion caused
by those waiting to catch the
elevator located right outside his
doon

Messner agreed. “It gets loud
when people are waiting forthe
elevator,” she said.

Messner and her roommates
had tried posting a sign to alert
other residents to the noise
problem, but the sign was

None of these, lounge residents
are looking forward to moving
out, regardless of the problems
they have had getting adjusted to
the situation. Moving will mean
readjusting, for as well as
changing rooms, these people
will be changing roommates.

Just how many licks does it take
to get to the center of a Tootsie
pop?

Call T elefact; it has the answer.

After just 20 days in operation,
Telefact has answered nearly
1,600 calls. “I smile when I talk
about it because I see it working,”
said Joyce Giangarlo, associate
director of student activities.

“We started slow —I think we
had about 25 calls the first day,
but we did a lot of research on
those 25 calls. I’m just waiting to
see our results at the end of a
month. We’ve»already got almost
1,600 calls in 20jdays, and that’s
on a new program.

“We’re looking at it, and it’s just
great. I can’t even bridle my
enthusiasm for how it works.
Students need to have a place to
go to get the answer _they’re
looking for. One of the big
problems we found was that
students can’t get an answer,”
Giangarlo said.

Prank calls, outlandish questions all part of Telefact

Giangarlo said that her biggest
concern in August was that
everything wasn’t in the database
systems yet. “We spent the
summer saying, ‘We’ll never be
ready.’ Then we decided on a
date, and said, ‘We'll look up
what we don’t know as we go
along.’ We were all facing the fact
that we knew we were going to

S‘ be tested.

“Now that we ’re into the system,
we’re concerned with getting
additional funding for it. The
Student Government Board has
to make some decisions about
how it should be carried on and
whether or not there are places in
the university budget to provide
some extra support for it.

“I hope the university will see
its way to provide it some support.
I hope the Student Government
Board will see its way to provide
support. I think it’s such a crucially
necessary item, even after just 20
days, that I don’t want to see
what happens if we don’t have it
again, and I'm proud of the
Student Government Board for
making this commitment,”
Giangarlo continued.

According to Giangarlo, the
statistics on the Telefact system
show that T elefact receives an
average of 78 calls a day between
the hours of noon and 9 p.m. Of

these calls, 96 percent are from '

students, and 78 percent of the
calls are university related. Friday
tends to be the busiest day for the
operators.

Pitt's Telefact was based on a
system that Bowling Green
University installed in 1971.
Giangarlo said that the operators
of BGU’s system were very helpful
in giving Pitt all of the information
it needed to get started.

Telefact operators are paid $6
an hour and were chosen for
their ability to find information
and use any resources available
to get an answer. Giangarlo said
that in the future, they would like
to hire freshman and sophomores
for longevity, but that for this
year, it wasn’t practical.

The operators were instructed
on how to use the FAX machine,
how to access databases, where
to look for information, how to
answer phones, how to handle a
crisis situation and how to use a
TDD (for the hearing impaired),
among other things.

“It’s been fun because people
call and ask a question, and
whether it’s a question that seems
silly in the asking of it, its not
necessarily silly when you get the
answer of it because, if you ask a

question and get the answer, it
sticks with you forever," Giangarlo
said.

Giangarlo said that she doesn't
think that Telefact is plagued by

- prank calls. “Is it a prank? I don’t

know. I think it’s just a test of the
system, and that's all right.
Somebody called and
asked,’Where are my shoes?’
Yeah, I guess that was a prank,
but he wasn't unhappy with his
answer. "Yesterday a‘ medical
student called and asked where
to buy a human skull, and there's
nothing wrong with that question.
[Telefact] is just like a direct ﬁnder
way through the university.”

released six—year plan for the city
of Pittsburgh proposes far-
reaching and far—out
improvements such as
recreational and commercial
developments, public parking
and even a heliport.

As detailed in her 1991—96 Six-
Year Development Program,"
Masloff listed the goals of the
individual neighborhood
programs:

1. To ensure a match between
city programs and resources and
community identified needs

2. To ensure ﬂexibility in the
implementation of public
programs

3. To emphasize the quality in
development that favors the
health of the city and
neighborhoods

4. To offer home ownership
and local employment to any
and all interested citizens.

The ultimate goal of the
programs is to encourage
cooperation between the citizens
and their government.

To meet these goals, a number

of programs and projects have
been instituted.

The Neighborhood Business
District Revitalization Program
targets neighborhood commercial
centers, seeking to improve them
and to make them competitive
with the suburban malls.
According to the report, these
malls are gradually hoarding the
shoppers’ dollars, thereby
decreasing the city’s revenue and
available income.

Terri Lowrence, supervisor of
the capital budget, described the
NBDRP as a “three—tiered plan”
that will lead to the most
advantageous and efficient
improvements to the
neighborhood retail districts.

According to Lowrence, the first
phase of the plan involves
providing managerial and
technical advisory assistance to
merchants in order to help them
devise the best improvements for
their individual businesses.

The second phase, called “Street
Face,” allocates funds to

merchants for the beautification
of their establishments. '

The final phase involves the
granting of funds to help develop
and maintain public—space
improvements. Public space
includes streetlights, trees,
shrubbery and upkeep of
sidewalks, etc. The overall result
is intended to be an aesthetically
pleasing, consumer—drawing retail
district.

Also proposed for Oakland in
the coming years is the
implementation of a
Neighborhood Employment
Program, which seeks to match
residents with job opportunities
in their own neighborhood. It is
hoped that such a plan will
partially relieve traffic congestion
as well as increase citizen
involvement within their
respective neighborhoods.

The six-year plan also seeks to
improve the quality of life within
the neighborhoods.

“I want people to know that if
they buy a house in Pittsburgh

that they have made a wise
investment for their children and
grandchildren,” said Masloff.

Masloffs public-opinion polls
have revealed that the best
improvements to make would be
racial and economic integration
of the neighborhoods, additional
emphasis placed upon residents
of public housing and programs
for the youth of the city.

To that end, the Long Range
General Land Use Plan has been
instituted. Downtown, in the
vicinity of Crawford and Lawrence
streets, a major project has just
been completed. Two hundred
units of residential housing were
constructed.

In North Oakland the
previously high-density
residential constituency of the
North Craig and Bayard streets
locale will be replaced by
commercial enterprises. Under
the six-year plan, the Schenley
Heights section of North Oakland
will be reshuffled from a medium-

S -'1.’/'

density residential area to a low-
density residential area. This
project is still in the drawing-
board stage.

Included in the six—year plan’s
budget are a number of private
and public investments which
will restructure the face of the
Oakland skyline. City funds for
1990 have been allocated for
renovations to Phipps
Conservatory, the Schenley Park
Pool and the Schenley Park and
Panther Hollow bridges. There
have been difficulties in securing
federal and state funds for the
bridge projects, however, and
that has resulted in some delays,
according to Maureen Hogan of
the City Department of Planning
in Oakland.

Feasibility and site inspections
are being conducted near Second
Avenue and Brady Street to
determine the possibility of the
installation of a Central Business
District heliport.

Pittsburgh czctiz/ists cczllfor unity in mcism stmggl

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

From a stage perched on the
Music Bastion of Fort Pitt's mined
walls, songwriter—activist Anne
Feeney urged a crowd of
approximately 100 to join in and
sing a ballad about liberals during
the Reagan era.

“Hey Ronnie Reagan, I’m black,
and I'm pagan. I’m gay, and I’m
left, and I'm free._ I'm a non-
Fundamentalist environmentalist
— Please don't bother me," she
sang. "

Failing to get the desired
audience participation, she smiled
knowingly and said that she knew
what the problem was.

“You’re all worried that
someone you don't know will
see you singing from across the

field and suspect that you're,”
she paused dramatically, “an
environmentalist.” ‘

Pittsburgh activists,
environmental and otherwise, met
in Point State Park Saturday to
educate the public and form a
unified front in the first
Celebration for Racial Equality
and Human Rights.

The celebration, organized by
a coalition of activist groups
ranging from the League of.Gay
and Lesbian Voters to the United
Electrical Radio and Machine
Workers of America, lasted from
noon until 5 p.m. and featured
lectures, poetry and music on the
subjects of human rights and
diversity.

“The chief struggle now is
unity," said writer and journalist

Moe Seager, who acted as master A

of ceremonies. “We certainly need
your unity of purpose, regardless
of what group you come from."

According to Lisa Frank,
member of the Palestine Solidarity
Committee and the celebration’s
coordinating committee, the unity
and networks of communication
set up between each participating
group was the event’s greatest
success, despite the absence of
huge crowds.

“This is an experiment in
building alliances,” she said.
“Everyone here knows the name
of contact people in [all the} other
groups, and that’s no small
success.”

Pitt’s head of the black studies
department, Dennis Brutus, spoke
on the struggle for human rights
both in Pittsburgh and his native

Racism  

Continued from page 6
South Africa.

“There are important things
going on here today," he said.
“Amnesty International, the
groups against U.S. involvement
in El Salvador [and others here]
are in a struggle to confront the
reality of our own lives as well as
the racism in the city of Pittsburgh
and the [issues oil homelessness
and inadequate medical care.
[These problems] are part of the
same single fabric of a racist and
oppressive society that will only
change when we make it change. ”

Of recent strife in South Africa,
Brutus said that the white
leadership of the country was
seeking to stay in power by using
black sellouts to keep the black
majority fighting against each
other.

“When the [television]
networks, who are invested in
South Africa, and the [American]
corporations remaining in South
Africa tell you that [the recent
fighting] is a tribal or a racial
struggle, there is one word to
remember: Bullshit,” he said.

Unity of the different causes
and groups was apparent

throughout the celebration.
Pitt music major Stacy Winters,

a member of BiGALA who
handled the publicity for the event
onthe Pitt campus, sang about
peace, women’s issues, AIDS
issues and basic freedoms.

Randa Shannon of Women for
Racial and Economic Equality had
an information table at which she
was giving out not only brochures
about sexism and racism but also
about the human-rights situation
in El Salvador.

A man‘ with a button bearing
the initials of the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador working the crowd with
a petition turned out to be Dan
Fine, an anti-nuclear activist trying
to get support for a worldwide
nuclear-weapon test ban.

“It’s a good [gathering] of people
of shared interests," he said.
“Everyone is interested in
supporting this [test banl.”

A Pitt and Pitt law school
alumnus, Feeney was enthusiastic
about the celebration and the
coalition.

“One of my favorite slogans is
‘Everything is connected,” she
said. “Coalition building is the
wave of the future. People who
are getting dumped on and
disenfranchised must work
together.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Monday, September 24, 1990

Yard

Continued from page 1
whether an absolute right to
privacy exists in the Constitution
has alarmed NOW leaders.

“lSouterl said, ‘Well, I think
there is a privacy right in the
Constitution, and I do believe
that it stands for the right of
marital use of contraception.’ So
[Sen.]Joe Biden pushed him and
asked, ‘Does that mean that we
have the right to procreate or not
procreate?’ Souter said, ‘Well you
have the right to procreate.’ I
don’t remember him being able
to say that included that right not
to procreate, and he was very
clear that did not extend to
unmarried people.”

Yard thinks that the Senate
should extend Souter’s hearings
so that new evidence regarding
Souter’s views on the Bill of Rights
can be brought to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

“The civil-rights community
asked them to extend the hearings
because they have come up with
a lot of information about
discrimination in New Hampshire.
David Souter says, ‘Well, there is
really no discrimination in New
Hampshire, not in our state. Why,
even I have among my friends a
Jew and an Irishman.’

“Such insensitivity, such a lack
of knowledge. Well the [National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People] legal defense
fund sent somebody up to New
Hampshire, and they found plenty
of discrimination,” Yard said.

Souter is often quoted from a

speech he made where he said,
‘Affirmative action is affirmative
discrimination.’ Yard said that the
SJC hearings need to be extended
so that the meaning of that speech
can be understood.

“I tell you those are code words ,

of the right wing for saying that
Affirmative Action is reverse
discrimination against whites.
That is what that word means. He
knew what he was saying..
Unfortunately, the SJC doesn’t
seem to understand at all,” Yard
said.

According to Yard, several
examples from his past prove
that prove that Souter would not
uphold First Amendment rights if
he were appointed to the Supreme
Court.

Yard cited a case about 18
years ago when Souter was
attorney general. The case
involved a protest at a nuclear
plant where activists had been
charged with trespassing.

Yard said that in similar cases,
courts almost always let activists
go without a fine or serving jail
time, but that when Souter found
out about the protest, “he was
indignant. He got in his helicopter
and ﬂew wherever this case was
being tried, and he demanded
that the judge put the guys in jail
who were guilty of trespassing
and give them ﬁnes.

“I would say that there is a
slight failure to recognize First
Amendment rights to free speech.
And that information needs to be
given to the Senate Judiciary

re’
CFIMPUS

Committee.”

Yard is disturbed by the way.
the SIG is rushing the conﬁrmation
hearings.

“What is the hurry? Why do
they have to decide this next
week? We need to make them
understand that there is no need
to hurry, understand that they
need to carry out their
constitutional responsibility
lfullyl,” Yard said.

NOW has organized a “Do or
Die Day” on Sept. 25.

“They’re having a massive rally
and lobby day two days before
the Senate gets to vote, and we
will really try to work in terms of
organizing people from all over
the country, not necessarily from
all over the country in such a
short time but to declare our war
[on the nomination of Souterl,”
Zempsey said.

Yard’s speech was prefaced by
a ﬁlm, Abortion Denied: Young
Lives Shattered, which focused
on the plight of teenagers in
states that have parental consent
laws.

These laws require minors to
inform and/or get permission

from one or both biological.

parents before having an
abortion. The film stressed that
these laws force teenagers, who
feel that they cannot tell their

parents of an unwanted
pregnancy, to seek illegal
abortions.

Yard read the audience some
letters that a friend in San
Francisco who worked at a health-

care clinic had received from
young women who were
pregnant.

“[The letters readzl ‘I don't dare
go to my parents because my
father would be so angry with me
that he would beat me up and
throw me out of the house.’ Or
‘my mother is an alcoholic, and I
can’t talk to to her, andl have no
father in the house.’ Or ‘my mother
is very sick, and I know that she
doesn’t approve of abortion, and
I can’t upset her because it might
hurt her health,”’ Yard said.

Over half of all minors do go to
their parents when they find out
they are pregnant, according to
Yard. But the law harms those
women who cannot go to their

parents, she said.

“Women have always gotten
abortions, and they always will.
In every society, in every culture,
it has been traced back for 2,500
years. They ﬁgure out what to do
when they are so desperate that
they feel that they cannot continue
a pregnancy. What happens is
women die, and many of them
have their reproductive organs
totally destroyed so that they can
never have a child. And I think
that is a total tragedy," Yard said.

"If you are 14 and you have an
illegal abortion, and your
reproductive organs are destroyed
so that you can never have a
child, that is a total tragedy,” she
said.

Protest

Continued from page 1

“There are those who say that
the baby is part of the woman,"
said Pitt student Paul Easler. “A
man in the Arctic climate could
not survive outside a building,
but that doesn’t make him part of
the building. *

“Likewise, a baby is not part of
a woman," he said.

Pitt alumna Kara Henry said
that the protesters were
“advocating life all the way, where
the other side is saying you have
a choice of life or death."

“The pro-choicer has taken
away the issue by calling it ‘pro-
choice,’” she said.

“You made your choice when

you decided to be involved with
the other person,” Henry said.

Wusinich said that “in many
cases women are only given one
choice —— to have an abortion
[because of their economic
circumstancesl.”

Twelve percent of the women
in the United States are black,
and 30 percent of the abortions in
the United States are performed
on black women, she said.

A NOW representative stood at
the door of the Teplitz Memorial
Courtroom warning both pro-
lifers and pro-choicers to leave
their signs outside and refrain
from creating disturbances once
inside.

Military pushing freedom of the press too far mm pm Ngwsﬁi

Whatis going through the minds
of the Pentagon's staff these days?
Last week, Gen. Michael Du gan,
the chief of staff of the Air Force,
gave information to the press to
the effect that the United States
should “decapitate” the head of
the Iraqis. This means that Amer-
ica, should we get involved in a
shooting war with Iraq, would
attempt to kill Saddam Hussein,
his family, his senior commanders
and even his mistress (which, of
course, everybody knows to be a
threat to society in the Muslim
world). ,
Then, “unnamed military
sources" informed The Washing-
ton Post that the United States will
launch a four-pronged attack
against the Iraqis should the United
Nations’ economic embargo fail.
With two fronts in Saudi Arabia
and one each in Turkey and Jor-
dan, these forces would effec-
tively knock out the Iraqi military
within weeks, maybe even days.
Gee, isn’t it nice to know what
the Pentagon is going to do before
it is even sure of it? I'm sure the
Iraqi senior commanders are very
interested in finding out.

As the crisis in the Persian Gulf
drags on into its third month, it’s
apparent that many people have
Qegug tpwctitisguss what options the

Arabia has been secured. Whether
or not we want to admit it, we
have reached a point in which the
decision has to be made about
whether our forces should take on
an offensive role in the effort to
free Kuwait. Although it is very
clear to me that it will be necessary
to attack Iraqi positions, it has
occurred to me that some people
who haven’t really made up their
minds about this issue may be
swayed by the misunderstood
antics of the “peace-at—all-cost”
minority in this country. For this
reason, I’d like to relate to the
aforementioned persons exactly
why we should take a strong mili-

The American press is one of the
most important institutions in the
free world. It is one of the many
checks and balances that make our

_ country the top democracy in the

world.

On the other hand, the American

days it seems that anybody can

American people have a “right to
know” what is going on in the
minds of our leading politicians.
But .I also feel that the American
public does not need to know
military options during a time of
crisis. They do not need to know
that the United States is going to
invade Iraq from four different

in the U.S. government.

This puts me in a hell of a
predicament because I am a
member of the American press.
Yes, I believe that freedom of the
press is a vital part of our
Constitution. Yes, I believe that the
government needs to have this
check on it to prevent widespread
corruption. Yes, I believe that the

After hearing many of the catchy

poor judgement in revealing his
data to the Post. As an Air Force
general, he should know the im-
portance of classiﬁcation and of
sensitive issues. Therefore, I be-
lieve that Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney was right in ﬁring him.
Right now American lives are at
stake. Soldiers are pounding the
sands of the Middle East trying to
keep the peace. American men,
stuck in Kuwait during the Iraqi
invasion, are being placed at stra-
tegic Iraqi military bases as a
human shield to prevent against a
potential bombing raid. These ﬂap-
ping mouths are not helping their
security in the least.

I fully endorse the United States’
military presence in the Persian
Gulf. It should be there to prevent

further Iraqi aggression against our
allies in the region. But telling the
American public and the world
through the media what they are
going to do is not only stupid, it’s.
dangerous (even if they know that
we’re going to kill Hussein’s mis-
tress).

Jeﬁ“ Tatusko is the perspective
editor of The Pitt News.

U.S. should take on offensive role in Gulf

the Allies were forced to help the
Soviet Union, we found ourselves
confronting, at war’s end, another
tyrant identical to Hitler.

In years past, the United States
has at many times condemned free
nations to political and social wr-
anny simply because we have
chosen to bow down to an all-too-

‘vocal minority of our population

which condemns any American
military action as a “corporate war”
or “imperialism.” Vietnam, Cam-
bodia, central Africa, Hungary and
Nicaragua are all glaring examples
of how ignorance among paciﬁsts
can lead to the wholesale slaughter
of free people under murderers
like Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot or Daniel
Ortega. Is peace worth the sacrifice

of the Kuwaiti people? Our actions '

in the Persian Gulf are not simply
dictated by the price of oil. Do the
peace protestors realize what is
being done to Kuwaitis? We cannot
turn our back on a friend.
Despite the imminent bloodlet-
ting of so-called emotional, albeit
asinine comparisons to Vietnam, I
believe we should attack Iraqi po-
sitions within the next "month. We
have the capability to destroy Iraq’s
air force within 24 hours and their
tanks, consisting mostly of 35-year-
old T—S4/5S’s would be little more
than scrap-iron targets for U.S. M1
tanks and ground-attack aircraft
like the AH-64 Apache and A-10
Warthog. They have no navy, thus,
coastal shelling could be carried
out at will, particularly when their
air force is constantly monitored
by AWACS surveillance aircraft and
subject to wave after wave of the
world’s best strike aircraft like the
F-111, A-6 Intruder, and, of course,
the F-117 stealth fighter. Don’t lis-
ten to the whining of the peace-
niks; this “Vietnam” wouldn't last
two weeks.

With deep surprise we have read
The Pitt News Sept. 20 article
“CISPES actually front for commu-
nism." This article shows a clear
misunderstanding of the Salvadoran
political process.

The only way to understand the

‘ Salvadoran conﬂict is through the
' analysis of the war that has taken

place in the last decade. The prob-
lem is that Mr. Lewis does not
consider the Salvadoran situation
as an armed conﬂict in which two
armies are ﬁghting. He considers
the Farabundo Marti National Lib-
eration Front (FMLN) as a terrorist
group and blames the FMLN guer-
rillas for all the destruction and
human-rights violations in El Sal-
vador: “The war they (the FMLN)
fight has led to the deaths of 70,000
Salvadorans, including 14 govern-
ment ofﬁcials.” This has been the
same approach of the U.S. Em-
bassy in San Salvador, the State
Department, the Salvadoran ex-
treme right and the armed forces.
To be serious about the complex
situation in El Salvador, we recom-

.mend avoiding the dichotomy

between good guys and bad guys
(government and FMLN), “terror-
ists” and “democrats,” because in
the past this has obscured perspec-

tives that would help to resolve the

conﬂict by political means.

A careful ‘reading of the Salva-
doran situation clearly shows that
the armed forces have been (ac-
cording to the humanitarian groups,
°s‘ﬁEli as ‘Afr‘r‘1‘é‘r‘iE§’s wane-h», area the
principal groups responsible for
the human-rights violations. The

main problem is the absence of
political willingness to differenti-
ate between the civilian popula-
tion and the guerrillas. Any kind of
opposition has been seen as
“communist,” and therefore, a tar-
get for torture and murder. This
problem of human-rights violations
by the armed forces has been a
constant aspect of the conﬂict. The

Letters  

reader should remember that the
Salvadoran armed forces were
responsible for the kidnapping,
rape and murder of the American
nuns in 1980, the four Dutch jour-
nalists in 1982 and so forth. All of
these human-rights violations
against civilians and several other
cases were the acts of the military,
not the guerrillas.

The most recent and shocking
case has been the slaying of the
Jesuits last November, also com-
mitted by the armed forces. The
Moakley report (Sen. J. Moakley,
D-Mass), released by the special
commission of the president of the
House of Representatives, stated
that the murders reflect deep prob-
lems inside the armed forces that
go beyond the action committed
by a particular unit during one
night. The “Arms Control and For-
eign Policy Caucus” of the U.S.
Congress, released another report
-in May 1990, “BARRIERS TO RE-
FORM; A PROFILE OF EL SALVA-
DOR’S MILITARY LEADERS,” in

After college, you can

On Friday afternoon I was stand-
ing on the steps of the William Pitt
Union nearly singing, “I'm going
home for the weekend!”

There are only so many nasty
letters to the editor a person can
take before she starts to grow weary.
I was all stressed out, and I thought
the time away might do me some
good.

Like so many college kids home
for the weekend, I had six loads of
laundry, and in between cycles I
planted myself, remote in hand, in
front of the television.

I watched countless scantily clad
women gyrate across the screen
before witnessing a truly impres-
sive commercial.

In a cough syrup ad, a woman
actually served as a man’s em-
ployer. Although this situation
occurs (however sporadically) in
reality, I was surprised by its por-
trayal in a TV commercial and said
so to my stepfather, an unsung
master of the art of “vidiocy.”

He argued that I’d misinterpreted
the ad entirely —— that the woman
was not the man’s boss at all —-— that
the two were, in fact, co-workers.

I maintained that my interpreta-
tion was the correct one and tried
not to let it get me down.

On top of the television, nestled
among many photos of my many
cousins and their respective Easter
baskets, I noticed my prom pic-
ture. I carried it to the kitchen

where my mother was loading the
dishwasher. -

“I can’t believe you still have this
out!” I said. (My mother has this
thing about the colors in a photo
matching the colors in the room
where it's displayed, and she had
recently redecorated. The living
room is now all done up in pastels
— thus my cousins’ Easter por-
traits were taken out of storage.)

which it concludes “that nearly all
of El Salvador’s commanding offi-
cers have presided over brutal
human-rights abuses committed by
troops under their command.” We
hope Mr. Lewis will not claim that
these reports from the U.S. Con-
gress are a “KGB forgery.”

To return to the main issue of the
[Committee In Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador] rally last
Saturday; it was to persuade the
Pennsylvania senators to suspend
aid to the Salvadoran government,
in a response to the increase of
human-rights violations. Mr. Lewis
argues that the best he could do is
to “ask him to reject this simplistic

~ solution that would plunge El Sal-

vador into a twilight.”

The depth of the Salvadoran
conﬂict demands that we be realis-
tic. El Salvador could not be
“plunged” into a “twilight” because
it is already in one. And this inten-
sification of the war, with all its
consequences, was probably due
to the United States’ support for the
Salvadoran regime, costing the
American taxpayers slightly more
than $1 million a day. The argu-
ment in favor of the military and
economic assistance to El Salvador
was justified in order to defeat the
guerrillas, professionalize and
modernize the armed forces, and
to build democracy. After a decade
of involvement and spending bil-
lions of dollars, the current situ-
ation is quite different from what
policy-makers expected. The armed
forces were not able to achieve a
military victory; the political center

built around the Christian Demo-
crats was defeated in elections by
the extreme-right party. Never-
theless, some progress has been
made in electoral matters. But the
most critical point, as we can see
in the case of the murdered Jesu-
its, is the anti-democratic behav-
ior of the armed forces that threat-
ens the democratic process.
Therefore, the point is to send a
clear message that the U.S. gov-
ernment is no longer going to
support human-rights violations
and wishes to promote negotia-
tions to end the war by a political
settlement. This would be carried
out according to thenegotiation
process taking place between the
government and the guerrillas
under the mediation of the United

O Nations.

The CISPES rally demanded a
cut in aid for the Salvadoran gov-
ernment as a mechanism of pres-
sure for progress on the human-
rights issue. The real debate going
on in Washington is not over
whether to send aid to El Salva-

dor, but rather how much and’

under what conditions.
To reduce the military aid by

half and make aid conditional _

based on progress and good will
from the government in the ne-

gotiations, is the best contribu-

tion that can be made to the cause
of peace and democracy in El Sal-
vador.

Stalemate... _ ,
Panthers pull out fourth quarter heroics to tie Syracuse

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —— If ties are
like kissing your sister, then excuse
the Panthers for sneaking a peck
at their Eastern Independent
sibling Syracuse this past weekend
on a day when tailback Curvin
Richards nursed a sprained ankle
on the bench, and the rest of the
Panther offense also took the first
half off.

When Pitt stumbled onto the
field with 3:41 left in the game, it
did so down by eight points in
one of the loudest stadiums in the
country, and also without Richards
and his 336 rushing yards, any
timeouts, and seemingly, a prayer.

But a mere two minutes later,
quarterback and occasional
miracle—worker Alex Van Pelt
resurrected —— at least temporarily
— the Panthers’ hopes for a major
bowl berth with a 25-yard
touchdown strike to wide receiver
Olanda Truitt and an ensuing
three-yard toss to Ronald Redmon
for the two-point conversion,
knotting the score at 20.

It was the second time in less

than a year that Van Pelt pulled a
rabbit out of his helmet to salvage
a mistake—p1agued Pitt effort. Van
Pelt threw for a career-high 366
yards in a 22—point come-from-
behind tie at West Virginia last
year that Mountaineer fans are
still reeling from.

But that was last year, a season
which the 2-1-1 Panthers are
trying their darnedest to put
behind them. They have high
expectations for 1990, and a tie at
this point of the season stings.

“West Virginia was a different
story. This wasn’t a comeback.
You’re still in the game when
you’re down by eight points,"
said Van Pelt, who threw for a
season-high 266 yards against
the Orangemen. “You can’t be
too happy when you’re only
down by eight and end up with
a tie.”

Maybe, but after the way they
played in the first 2 1/2 quarters,
a Panther comeback seemed
about as likely as the Carrier
Dome’s roof caving in.

“We showed we know how to
fight. Unfortunately, not the

Kevin Williams rushed for 87 yards on 15 carries aminst Syracuse.

By Doug Miller
staff Writer

Chances are slim that people will not confuse
Panther tailback Kevin Williams with Swervin’
Curvin Richards. At least not yet, anyway.

But after this weekend’s game against Syracuse,
Williams appears headed for a promising future
with the Panthers. The redshirt freshman filled in
for Richards and Glenn Deveaux, and led all
Panther rushers with 87 net yards on 15 carries.

How Williams came to play in the battle for
Eastern supremacy can be traced to Richards’ injury
last Wednesday in practice, where he sprained his
right ankle. Richards was expected to play but
never saw action in the Carrier Dome. Early in the
second quarter, starting Panther tailback Glenn
Deveaux took a hard hit from Syracuse free safety
Rob Thomson and coughed up the ball, with SU
recovering. Deveaux was subsequently benched as
a result of his fumble.

Coach Paul Hackett went to the bench and found
Williams ready to play.

‘‘I can’t say enough about Kevin. Holy smokes.
We knew there was a chance he had to go, and
when Deveaux fumbled the ball early, we felt we
needed to make a change. We ask a lot of Glenn by
playing fullback,” Hackett said. “Kevin Williams
saved [us] today.”

At the beginning of the season Williams was
projected as the fourth-string tailback, behind
Richards, Deveaux andjemiaine Williams. However,
he surpassed Jermaine Williams into third place,
and the rest is history.

Kevin Williams appeared quite comfortable with
the different looks the Panther offense showed
Syracuse. He sprinted through holes in the line,
swept outside and was used as a decoy on pass
patterns. He did it all without the coaches’ having
to alter the offensive scheme, something that
usually happens when a third- stringer enters the
game.

“I’m not really sure if [Syracuse] noticed a switch
in the tailbacks at first. After awhile they tried
stripping the ball and talking junk, trying to intimidate
me,” Williams said. “They really didn’t affect me. I

knewl had a job to do, and I tried as hard as I could
to do it. This is a really hard place to play, with the
noise and their linebackers, but I’m pleased with
the way I played,” he added.

The rest of the team was also pleased after
Williams set up Pitt’s first score, (a Scott Kaplan 18-
yard field goal) with a 27-yard scamper around the
right end, eluding several tacklers with nifty moves
before ﬁnally being hauled down at the Syracuse 6-
yard line.

The Orangemen defense then started to pay
attention to Wi1liarns,_which probably had a great
deal to do with the Panther passing attack coming
to life in the second half.

So how does an incumbent tailback feel about
the new competition?

‘‘I think he did a real good job. He gave the team
a 100—percent effort, and he did what he is capable
of doing. I think he can do a lot more, which we will
see in time,” Richards said.

“He is a real compliment to our backﬁeld; between
me, Glenn [Deveaux] and Kevin, we can give teams
a different look at any time, which keeps opponents
off balance. Kev is a real dangerous back,” Richards
added. ’

Besides the fact that both Richards and Williams
play the same position, they have a few more things
in common.

Both come from the football-rich state of Texas
as highly touted blue—chip backs. They both have
the ability of busting a long run with their tremendous
speed and shifty moves, and both look like
waterbugs among Pitt’s giant linemen.

This week will, in all probability, mark the return
of Richards, which will definitely relegate Williams
to less playing time. That doesn’t phase him though.
“I’ll do anything to help this team  ifl can help out

me,” Williams said.

None of the players appeared satisfied with the

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, September 24, 1990 .

For T be Pitt News

If the Lady Panthers’ volleyball
match yesterday against the
University of Connecticut is any
indication of the quality of Big
East competition, the No. 20-
ranked Lady Panthers should go
undefeated in conference play.

The Lady Panthers whipped

the Lady Huskies in three games,

15-7, 15-1, 15-11, raising their
season record to 9-2.

According to Pitt Coach Sue
Woodstra, the Lady Panthers
played “a decent and hard-fought
match.”

While the score indicates an
easy victory, the team struggled
in the third game. Down 1-7, the
Panthers gave up only four more
points, while running off 14 of
their own.

 

Jason

Dee MacAulay helped the Lady Panthers to three-game shutout last
night against Big East rival UConn.

Pitt's ability to maintain that
dominance throughout the year
will come down to the ability of
its bench to rebound from injuries.
Two players, Bridget Gary and
Carrie Thornton, currently are
unavailable due to knee injuries,
according to Coach Woodstra.

“While neither player is a starter,
we need all the players available
on the bench,” Woodstra said.

This match allowed Woodstra
to rest many of her starters, while
giving her younger substitutes a
chance for abundant playing time
to gain valuable match experience.

2€Km:::

Pie Kol Nidre Dinner

To give an idea of how small
the Pitt team really is, the UConn
‘squad currently has 15 players,
while the Lady Panthers have
only 10, eight of which are
currently available to play due to
the injuries to Gary and Thornton.
While the team may not be
greatly affected in single match
formats, tournaments like the
upcoming ones with Syracuse
Tournament this weekend and
the Georgia Oct. 5-6, could
become too mentally and
physically taxing for the team to
maintain its current level of play.

Lady Panther Volleyball plasters first Big Eastopponent

The Lady Panthers’ victory
served as a lift following their 3-
0 loss to No. 13 Ohio State last
Wednesday at Columbus, Ohio.

The team has six Big East
conference matches left before
the seasonending Big East
tournament. The next match will
be the Syracuse tournament this
weekend. The team plays the

Syracuse too had its problems.
The Orangemen (1-1-2) gave up
a last-second tying field goal to
Michigan State last week and
collapsed again this week,
beginning with what used to be
a Syracuse trademark — the
extra point.

The Orangemen set a NCAA
record by kicking 262 consecutive
PATs from 1978-89, but lately
even that task has been a
challenge.

and sprinted downfield for two
points.

That play reversed Pitt’s
fortunes of the first three quarters,
which saw the Panthers commit
several key mistakes, a habit that
has grown to be a regular
occurrence for the team:

0 Derrick Lewis caught a pass
and stepped out of bounds before
gaining enough for a first down
on a fourth and two.

0 Tailback Glenn Deveaux
fumbled in the second quarter
(the 10th time the Panthers have
fumbled this year), and was
benched for the rest of the game.

0 Doug Hetzler let a punt return
slip through his hands (fumble
No. 11) with six minutes left in
the game, and the Orangemen
recovered the ball.

0 Linebacker Ricardo

quarterback Marvin Graves after
the whistle and was called for a
personal foul.

LoPrinzi plays No. 1 singles this fall

By Rob Mazur

For the Pitt News

While she may lack the power
of Steffi Graf or the career
accomplishments of Martina
Navratilova, Julie LoPrinzi of the
Lady Panther tennis team makes
up for it with emotion and drive.
LoPrinzi, the Lady Panthers’ No.
1 singles player, currently boasts
an undefeated record after three
matches.

LoPrinzi has been playing
tennis since she was 6 years old,
for a current total of 12 years. The
18—year—old sophomore played

four years of high school tennis,
all as the No. 1 player. In her
senior year, she was undefeated
with a perfect 17-0 record.

This is LoPrinzi’s second year
on Pitt's team, as she played No.
2 singles last year. Her roommate,
Erika Devins, was No. 1 last year,
but has had to sit out this year
with a groin pull. “When she
comes back, we’ll have to have a
playoff for No. 1. That should be
an exciting match, ” said LoPrinzi.

LoPrinzi said her toughest
match this year was last Thursday
against Janet Holzhausser of
Mercyhurst College. LoPrinzi

said,. “It was like playing against
a backboard; you just don't win.”

LoPrinzi won the match in three
sets, 7-5, 2-6, 7-6, (7-3). Down 2-
5 in the third set, LoPrinzi came
back to win. “Being down 2-5 in
the third set when you are
exhausted is like being down
two touchdowns in the last two
minutes of a football game,” said
Coach George Dieffenbach when

. asked about the match. “Julie did

a tremendous job to come back
and record the win.”

“It was a combination of her
playing well and me not playing
my best,” said LoPrinzi.

The 199 Student Government Board

would like to inform all students about the
reinstatement of the prestigious Blue and Gold
Award. The Blue and Gold Award is designed to
recognize one undergraduate student enrolled
in the University of Pittsburgh who shows high
scholarship, character, leadership, and
embodies the ideas and spirit of the University
community. We encourage anyone who believes
they have an overwhelming amount of
Homecoming Spirit to apply.
Applications are available in Room 639 of the

Cost Center opens

By Rob Mazur
For the Pin News

The new multirnillion-dollar Charles L. Cost Center may not
bring the Davis Cup of tennis to the University of Pittsburgh,
but it dramatically improves the tennis facilities.

Until now, both men's and women's matches were played on
the Allequippa Street fraternity courts. This location offers only
four courts, a water fountain and a great view of the fraternity
houses.

The Cost Center boasts nine indoor artiﬁcial-surface courts.
The facility, built for approximately $4 million, will be available
to all Pitt faculty, staff and students free of charge with a
university ID. Courts are available on a first- come-first-serve
basis, or students may call 648-9700 for availability information.

The Cost Center will be open for tennis Monday—Friday from
8 a.m.-2 p.m. and 6-10 p.m. It will be open Saturday and Sunday
from 8 a.m.-10 p.m.

Cohen back in action for tennis
team after a one year absence

By Christopher Block
For The Pitt News

Watching the intensity in her
eyes as she shufﬂes her feet while
sizing up an opponents’ serve
makes one consider the reality of
the situation. This lady knows
her way around a tennis court.
Twenty-one—year-old Pitt tennis
co-captain Jill Cohen stands
poised and ready, waiting for the
chance to rip a sizzling backhand
across the court in hopes of

contributing a victory to her team. S

Cohen began playing tennis
when she was 10 years old, and
both her parents have been
playing for as long as she can
remember. Her mother was a
member of a nationally ranked
team and competed on the Volvo
tour last year for a team ranked in
the top three in the country.

Her brother Brad played on his
hi gh—school team and also played

for one year for Case-Western
University. Growing up
surrounded by all of this tennis,
one would think that her interest
in the sport would have been

heightened by her parents, but

she is quick to correct that idea.
“My parents never pushed me;
they always let me make up my
own mind about tennis,” Cohen
said.

The real inspiration for her
interest was her friends. “After
watching them play, I loved the
game and began hitting‘ with
them. I loved going to the courts
to hit because I knew my friends
would be there.” V

In high school, Cohen’s skills
really began to gel. She played
on the Mount Lebanon varsity
tennis team for four years. She
played well enough in her junior
and senior years to be seeded in
the Top 3 on her team, often
playing second or third singles.

(film Pitt News ’

At the end of her high-school
career, Clarion college showed
some interest, but she opted to
come to Pitt to try to make the
squad as a walk—on.

Here at Pitt, Cohen has
thoroughly enjoyed herself, and
tennis has played a large role.
She played varsity her ﬁrst two
years and enjoyed two very
competitive and rewarding

seasons. After a short break from 0‘

tennis last year for personal

reasons, Cohen has returned to ‘

the team with a fresh attitude and
a new desire to win. She enjoys
the competition and always looks
forward to her next match.

“I don’t really get nervous
before a match; I get excited. I’m
very competitive, but I don’t let it
hurt my game by getting too
excited,” she said. A very team-
oriented player, Cohen is quick
to praise her teammates. “We
have a very good team this year,
the best I’ve seen since I’ve been
here. [Soph.] Julie Loprinzi and
[fr.] Catherine Bratton have been
really tremendous additions to
our team. All of us have had to
work extra hard because Erika
Devans is injured.”

Cohen also heralds Coach
George Dieffenbach, who has
has always been there for her
when she needed help. “He has
really been great for me. He
motivates the whole team and
helps to drill us if he discovers a
weakness in our game.”

As for herself and her position
as captain, Cohen remains very
modest. “Everything to me is the
team. We are very close, and our
closeness makes for a very relaxed
atmosphere. [Being captain is] a
big responsibility, but I like to
motivate the team and add fun to
the seriousness of the game."

“Jill is very aggressive. She
works very hard on her
consistency and is a fine student.
She adds depth to our team,” said
Dieffenbach. Sophomore Rachel
Graham added, “She ’s a very good
player. Her best quality is her
attitude which she spreads around
the whole team.”

As for the future, Cohen hopes
to go on to a career in teaching
hearing—impaired children or
speech pathology. Of course,
she plans on playing tennis for a
long time, and that is probably a

, good thing. Because whether it is

for Pitt or just for fun, playing
tennis is what Jill Cohen should
be doing.

Crew rows for dollars

D By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor '
la ‘*1
Most members of the Pitt Crew
" team put in half an hour’S rowing
time. Altogether, they rowed for
24 hours this past Thursday and
Friday in a marathon to raise
funds for a new eight—man shell.
According to Lou Morehead,
the club has a two-man and a
four-man shell, “but eight is where
4.‘ the highest level of competition
is.
“The sport is based on eights.
The Ivy Leagues only row eights,”
he said.
According to Morehead, a used

eight—man shell will cost the team
$7,500. 3

On Sept. 29, the team will face
its first competition of the year,
the “Head of the Ohio,” which
benefits the Mercy Hospital burn
center. A

Pitt Crew’s competitors in the
Head of the Ohio will include the
Ivy League schools and the U.S.
Olympic Rowing team, Morehead
said.

During last week’s fundraiser,
Pitt Crew members worked in
pairs. While one member rowed,
the other asked passers-by for
donations. The Crew also sold T-
shirts for $15.
