Pitt shuttles offer wild weekend    

_ Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

When freshmen Allie Bernknopf and Ja-
maad Abdi hopped on the 10A sometime
after midnight on a recent Saturday, the
two women weren’t going to a party ——
they were on one.

After setting out at 11:30 and hitting
up a frat party, they and their group of
friends boarded the 10A,for the first
time.

There was no plan, just ‘Fhop on a bus,
see where it took us,”'Abdi said.
They found themselves in unfamiliar

' waters _—— an upper campus shuttle that

becomes a Pitt party limbo on’the week~
ends’, shufﬂing students from party to
party, or from party to bed for the ones
who’ve had enough.

Whether people were going to a par-

jty or leaving one, once they set foot on

the dimly lit bus, they transformed into
a loud mass where indoor voices were

ignored and awkward arm dancing was

requisite. .
For each ride, the trip on the bus was

\

brief but poignant. Love blossomed,
friends were reunited and strangers be-
came, well, acquaintances. A 4

For riders aboard the 10A, which shut-
tles students between upper and lower

T campus, .the bus became more than just
transportation. Itwas the place to be.

A peculiar limbo .3

Most passengers «on the bus fell into
three‘ types: the drunkards, the lovers and
the loners. The inebriated sect was the
largest + and the most raucous. '

Woman
assaulted

Staff Report

Police are looking for a manlwho raped a
20-year-old woman in the 3300 block of
Parkview Avenue early Sunday morning.

City police said they are searchingfor ablack

man between 5’ 8” and 5’ 9” with a muscular .

build. The manwas last seen wearingabandana
or skull cap with webbing-— possibly pantyhose
— covering his face, city police spokeswoman
Diane Richard said in an e-mail. Richard did not
know whether the woman was a Pitt student,
and University officials did not respond to calls
before deadline.

The victim told police she was awakened at
5 a.m. by the sound of footsteps coming up the
stairs, Richard said. The victim said anunknown
mantold her not to make any noise, under risk
of bodily harm. '

The victim’s roommate heard noises and
called to check up on her, according to police
reports. The victim, fearing for her life, said she
was okay, Richard said. 4 A

The man then sexually assaulted the victim,
leaving about? a. In. Other roommates were not
harmed. Police set up a perimeter to catch the
suspect but were unsuccessful. ,

Richard said the man entered the residence
through a lower front window. The unlocked
window had a broken lock. The city police de-
partment’s Sexual Assault and Family Crisis Unit
is currently conducting an investigation.

“The best thing that anyone can do is make
sure their windows and doors are locked at
night and be aware of their surroundings,”

2 Richard said.

Richard said that anyone with information
about the incident should call the Sexual Assault

andFamily Crisis Unit at 412323-7141 or the ,

Major Crimes Unit at 412-323-7800. Anyone
with an emergency can call the Pitt police at
412-624-2121 or 911.

The Pitt News does not release the names

of rape victims.

House Rules

Rules of the 10A are simple: —
Don’t obstruct the driver’s vi-
sion and stay behind the white
line while the bus is moving. A
person holding a puppy while tak-
ing swigs from a ﬂask of whiskey
and sucking down a Marlboro
Red would not be welcome on
the bus.

The shuttles are University
property, and therefore subject
to Pitt’s Student Code of Conduct.
In accordance with Pitt’s zero-
tolerance policy, underage drink-
ing and illegal drug use are not

permitted.

Shuttle requires      
imaginative dance moves

Party bus 4 1

Identifying to which group
a new rider belonged took only
seconds. The loners were sub-
dued — women hugging their
bags close to their bodies, men
with hands in their pockets.

After ﬂashing Pitt identiﬁ-
cation, they quickly took seats
in the front, turned their head
away from the action, and rode
quietly, anonymously. '

The lovers, always in groups
of two , acted as single units.
From the moment they stepped
on the bus, they never broke
physical contact. It might have
made navigating the narrow
walkway of the bus awkward,
but the couples never let go of
one another. ‘

Once seated, the guy’s arm
would pillow his sweetheart’s
head: perhaps as a sign of affec-
tion, but more likely as a shield
against the final group — the
drunkards.

These party—hearty students
boarded in packs.

Their state of sobriety could,

in most cases, be measured by
the force at which their hips

gyrated to the music blaring"

through the speakers.

One group — whose gyrations
were particularly pronounced —
flocked to the back of the bus

,Saturday night, committing afew

10A faux pas along the way.
Cameras with flashes and feet
on the seats are 10A no—nos, and
the bus driver turned off the ra-
dio at one point to inform the

ing. .
The resulting silence was

brief. Once the radio came back;
on, the inebriated sect sang and

danced along again.

Whatever Pitt students were
engaged with‘ prior to getting on
the shuttle, it seemed to have in-
fected them with boogie fever.

’ When Usher’s new song, “DJ A

Got Us Fallin’ in Love,” blasted
through the stereo, the bump-
ing bass triggered an almost
universal response — one that
often necessitated the protective
shield of the lovers.

‘ Arms swung and fists pumped

erratically. Bottoms quivered in —

seats. Most of the riders trem-
bled with desire to get up and
dance, but safety requirements
forced them to be still from the
waist down.

' It would seem that a body
part restricted to a few bend-
able joints would only move in
a certain number of ways, but
Pitt students are nothing if not
innovative.

They pointed fingers. They
raised the roof.

One guy did a one—armed
worm, and one girl grasped the

, seat in front of her, bent over and

shook her entire upper torso,
much like a dog shaking off after
getting wet. .

For most riders, their stint
on the 10A lasted about as long
as the Usher song. Whether they
were going to McDonald’s, Hem-
ingway’s or home, most took the

to demonstrate their full body

range of motion.

They shimmi_ed and swayed
off the bus — not quite to the
beat of the music, but close. ‘

Several girls took advantage

’ of the poles that ran across the

sides of the seat, adding to their
dramatic exit. .

Of course, not all passengers
aboard the 10A were lovers, lon-
ers or home-bound partiers.

One girl, who asked not to be
named, was more interested in
discussing the alterations to the
Port Authority routes.

' After expressing dismay over
the Port Authority changes, she
turned in her seat, perhaps to
discourage the guy who seemed
to be hittingpon her.

The rambunctiousness waned
as the night progressed.

Two sophomores, Alexa
Dombkoski and Ali Holtzman,
who rode the busat two in the
morning on Friday called the
night “same old, same old.”

They decided to call it a night
after ﬁnding Pizza Sola bursting
with students. A

They, along with a few. other

passengers still on the bus, said '

the 10A was pretty subdued com-
pared to earlier hours.

By the time 2:30 a.m. rolled
around, the shuttle had only one
other rider remaining.

Sprawled in a seat behind the
driver, he belted along with Alice
Cooper’s “School’s Out”.

He didn’t get the lyrics

Soldiers 8: Sailors receives

grant, plans green renovation

Jennifer Hirsch
Staﬁ” Writer

Executives at Soldiers 8: Sailors Memo-
rial Hall and Museum plan to retool their
lighting system, in hopes of saving thou-
sands of dollars.

The Oakland landmark received aestate
grant as part of Gov. Ed Rendell’s energy
plan for Pennsylvania. ,

The memorial hall will receive $84,000
of the $20.5 million grant allocated for 40
projects throughout the state.

During the next few months, Soldiers
8: Sailors will see a complete remodeling
of its lighting system, saidjohn McCabe,
vice president of the ‘memorial.

The hall originally wanted to install a
“green roof,” but results from an energy
audit determined that remodeling the
lighting system would be most effective

_ _ — the planned green roof would have had

grass to help grow plants, insulate the
building and drain water from the roof.
So instead, they focused onlights. _e
“Our light fixtures are energy sappers,”
McCabe said. i

They will replace the older lights with
LED energy—saving bulbs.

Motion-activated light sensors will also
be added to the museum display cases to
reduce unnecessary use. .

Other improvements to be made in
clude a complete remodeling of the heat-
ing, ventilation and air conditioning sys-

tems and the installation of variable speed

drives, McCabe said.

Variable speed drives regulate the
speed of motors on different utility sys-
tems, slowing them down when not in
use. .
The ‘improvements will reduce the
memorial hall’s costs of operation, in
addition to making the landmark more
environmentally friendly.

Soldiers & Sailors expects to see car-
bon dioxide emissions reduce by 321,874
pounds per year.

This will save $37,174 per year in energy
and fuel costs, McCabe said.

“There will be an outlay of cash, of
course, to do theséimprovements,” he
said, “but we will recoup that money over
time.”

Improvements have been made since.

McCabe began working about a decade
ago, yet few affected energy consumption.
With the 100th anniversary of Soldiers 8:
Sailors approaching in October, McCabe
said he recognized the need for serious
change —“especially today with everyone
‘going green.”’ l

‘ His sentiment was echoed by Alyssa
Hopper, a research and resource specialist
at the Green Building Alliance and a Pitt
graduate. .

" Hopper, who has worked on green
building projects, explained that updat-
ing to a more efficient system doesn’t
require a complete overhaul, but instead
improvements to what’s already in place,
like lighting fixtures and heating and cool-

ing systems. A

When it comes to historical buildings,
there is always preservation to consider.

“You are preserving the past,” Hopper
said, “and you want to do that in a very
careful way.”

’ During the upgrades, Soldiers 8: Sailors A

will remain open to visitors, with minimal
impact on the hours of operation, McCabe
said. Construction is expected to begin

this fall and last 18 months-. I

Don’t get too comfy: crime always a
concern on campus

Attention Pitt students: You might think
you’re invincible, but you’re not.

Because of recent robberies in Bouquet
Gardens as well as a reported rape and
break-in on Parkview Avenue, we began to
think about safety on college campuses.

We found that college campuses tend
to be breeding grounds for crime. A re-
cent report of by Insite Security, a secu-
rity and risk management ﬁrm, found that
three-quarters of the colleges and their
surrounding areas had sex-oﬂ'ense rates
that were 83 percent higher than the na-
tional averages.

But according to CNN, both students

and parents don’t consider safety to be a V

big issue. In addition, students often have
an attitude that nothing bad will ever hap-
pen to them.

While we’d like to think we won’t become
victims of campus crime, we’d rather be safe
than lose our Xbox 3605 — or worse.

Although freshmen are encouraged to
keep dorm room doors open to promote
meeting new people, remember that only
applies when you’re in your room. Even
if your building has a secured entry, your

A building-mates and their guests can just

as easily swipe your iPod or MacBook Pro.
Investing in locks for your electronics is
not a bad idea either. ’

If you plan on inviting people over, make

sure you trust them not to take your be-
longings. If you'can’t ensure this, consider
locking up your valuables.

Be careful what you post on social me-
dia sites like Facebook, Twitter and Four-
square. Posting that you’re going out of
town or even that you’ll be elsewhere for
the evening could be an invitation to get
robbed. According to Mashable, a social
media news site, a pair of burglars in New
Hampshire looked at the updates ofone
of their targets on Facebook to ﬁgure out
when he wouldn’t be home.

Try to travel in groups. And though we’re
sure you probably won’t go anywhere with-
out your cell phone, make sure you check

that it’s charged.

And although we hope it never comes
down to this, know that some activist
groups suggest yelling “ﬁre” instead of
“rape” or “help” during an emergency. Yell-

ing “ﬁre” is more likely to draw crowds, ~

while yelling “rape” or “help” is taken less
seriously, according to a ﬁlm produced by
Just Yell Fire, a nonproﬁt group seeking to
stop the assault and abduction of girls.
College is fun. Crime is not.
Let’s be cautious and prevent the crimes
we can. After all, our parents probably

. won’t be willing to replace that Nintendo

Wii if it gets stolen. And wecertainly can’t
replace you. .

The country that cried allegations of racism

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

What is a good way to get somebody to
shut up? Maybe it is delivering a solid

‘verbal blow that deflates the windbag.

Maybe it is ignoring what they have to
say. Unfortunately, in this day and age,
a great way to get someone to shut up,
or at least deprive him of an audience,
is to call him a racist — whether or not
this accusation is grounded in fact. This
irritating practice is widespread, and it
has serious repercussions.

Allegations of racism swirl vehemently
around the Tea Party movement.

The National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People has lam-
basted the party and set up a group to
monitor it. Never mind that accusation
is not the same as evidence. Never mind
that the Tea Party has black activists in it.
Never mind that the presence of random
racists in the movement — or possible
liberal plants at particular rallies — does
not mean that everyone who is part of the
Tea Party is automatically a racist. My
personal favorite argument “proving” Tea
Party racism is that they are “white, male,
conservatives, anti-birthers, anti—health
care, and of course the well known anti-I

don’t want to pay my taxes people,” as
Politicol News reports. '
Allegations of racism are not a re.-
cent phenomenon. Charles Pickering, a
George W. Bush nominee to the Court of
Appeals, was accused of having a “big—

oted past” by Salon.com. According to’

RealClearPolitics.com,John Kerry called
Pickering “a known forceful advocate for
a cross-burner in America”. This came
despite the fact that the black community

‘in Pickering’s hometown supported his

nomination, and the fact that Picker-
ing testified against a leader of the Ku
Klux Klan in 1960s Mississippi, a time
and place where such_a move could be
dangerous.

There are indications that at least one ‘

liberal journalist, Spencer Ackerman,
suggested calling random Republicans

I racists in order to deflect attention from

President Obama’s former pastor, Jeremi-
ah Wright. The _]ournoList blog, quoted
in the Wall Streetjournal, contained the
following gem: “If the right forces us all
to either defend Wright or tear him down,
no matter what we choose, we lose the
game they’ve put upon us. Instead, take
one of them — Fred Barnes, Karl Rove,
who cares —— and call them racists.”
There are very real problems with
repeated cries of racism. First and fore-

most, an accusation of racism is a way
of closing down debate. After all, if the
person wanting to make an argument is
a known “racist,” why should his argu-
ment receive any audience? In order for
this branded person to make his argu-
ments heard, he first has to prove he is
not a racist. And how do you prove this?
You can’t. Racism is a set of beliefs and
thoughts. Unless people read your mind,
nothing you can do or say will prove that
you aren’t secretly racist. -

Although they might win an argu-
ment, accusations of racism are poor
argumentation. l

Not only do they demonstrate the
logical fallacy". of argumentum ad hom-
inem —-attacking the man — they also
demonstrate the ﬂaw of the non sequi-
tur. If somebody disapproves of a policy
of President Obama’s, such as eliminat-
ing the Bush-era tax cuts, does it matter
that that person isa racist? If the argu-
ment made is based in racism, then by
all means, we reject it on those grounds.
But if the argument is based in economic
reasoning or abstract thought, the ideol-

_ ogy of the person making the argument‘

is irrelevant.

vlWhen ad hominemattacks are used,
political discourse is irrevocably‘cheap-
ened. Instead of discussing the ideas that

are plainly before us, we begin to gossip
about motivation for forwarding those
ideas. Instead of engaging in rational
argument, we fall to name-calling. It
becomes abattle between the “racist”
right-wing and the “socialist” left.

This name-calling has other conse-
quences. Part of the reason that we are
the cowards Eric Holder thinks we are,
unwilling to have a national discussion on
race, is that those who would start talking
are afraid of the charge of racism.

The ultimate consequences of see-
ing racists behind every rock, tree and
George Bush are serious. Actual racism

will end up being ignored. Essentially,

we become the villagers tired of hearing
the boy cry wolf.

Republicans and Democrats alike
might reﬂexively close ranks around a
bigot that has been called a bigot. It’s
part of the reason I doubt the charges of
racism against the Tea Party.

I do not deny that there are racists in
the Republican.Party and the Tea Party
movement. Any group is bound to have a
few people who feel themselves superior
based onlracial identity. But when all of
the members of a group are indicted, it is

g hard to tell who.is actually guilty. I

Preparing for fall . primetime takessome finesse

Ragini Gupta
Columnist

With school in session and a crisp chill
in the air, the start of fall TV shows is
just around the corner. While true and
trained primetime television patrons
have already scoped out their options,
set up each day’s viewing schedule and
familiarized themselves with integral

V characters and continuing storylines,

there is still time if you haven’t started
yet. .
There are at least five main players in
terms of channels -4 even more if you’re
ahigh roller and have networks like HBO

_ and.Bravo. This means there are at least

five shows playing atany given time after
8.p.m. —,— but sadly, there’s onlyone of
you. And unfortunately, you can’t have
somebody watch a show for you and truly
enjoy it for all it has to offer.»

There are a few solutions. First, you
could get DVR, but’ that requires some
cash and digital cable. Second, you could
catch reruns later in the week.‘ Unfor-
tunately, they’re generally onua Friday
night, which means they’ll cut into your

social time. And surely someone will
have spoiled it for you by that point.
Ultimately, the fact is that you’ll have
to be discriminatory in the shows you
watch. ,
Picking shows is not child’s play. Like a
large purchase, it requires an investment

of resources, like time. There is also a’

cost to picking a bad show. While you
waste time watching a mediocre show,‘
you’re missing award—winning shows on
other channels. So pick wisely.

There are a few key things toconsider
when picking programs. Ideally content
ismost important. Maybe there were
some ads that caught your eye during
the summer. Check those out to see if
the actual plot lines and characters are
as thrilling as the ads made them out

to be. TV websites are great for this.

While you’re there, check out the other
shows that are airing on that channel.
Hopefully you’ll pick up a few more vi-
able candidates. _ ’

A word about continuing series —— ask

yourself how much you liked the last’
season. Did you watch because‘ nothing ,

else good was on or was it truly a core_—
changing experience? Is the series just

dragging’ on now or does it still have.

some meat in it? Get rid of any junk in
the entertainment closet you’ve got in
your brain so you can make room for the
new stuff. There are only so many hours
of primetime in a week. ‘ '

So you’ve got the players, now you’ve
got to arrange them on the ﬁeld. The
best’ shows run during the wgek between
8 and 11 p.m. Technically,’ you could
regularly watch 15ishows. But let’s be
sensible. You’d probably mix up charac-
ters and storylines if you watched that
many. Programs will also start to look
alike because there are only so many
worthwhile plots. Last year, the similari-

ties between The CW’s Gossip Girl and.

One Tree Hill were annoying. Around

the same time, cancer struck moms in.

both shows. In both finales. last spring,
main_ characters were shot. TV watchers
want variety!’

'- Plus, you have other obligations, like

, night labs and those 6-8:30 classes,

which are sure to eat into coveted tube
time. If you can switch out of those time
slots, it may be wise to do so — it’s a
worthwhile sacrifice. There are also
meetings and team practices. It’s up to

you to decide which shows and which
obligations are more important.

If you follow multiple series, mark
them on your schedule, at least at first,
to make sure they don’t conflict with

each other or. with academic or social

engagements. .

Picking multiple shows on the same
channel decreases the physical possibil-
ity of having multiple shows playing at
the same time, but increases the likeli-
hood of similar story elements.

Take the shows you shortlisted in the
beginning andany continuing series you
have deemed worthy of your future com-
mitment and put them into a schedule
to remind you of when you must be in
front of the telly.

And ﬁnally, make sureto put a cap on
the hours you spend in front of the boob
tube. While it’s ﬁne to schedule in your
“faves” during the week, try not to ne-
glect your own life’s drama in exchange
for HBO’s. And above all, avoid TV show
marathons or risk ﬁnding yourself won-
dering where the past 10 hours ofyour
life have gone.‘ I

“The Phantom of the Opera”

The Benedum Center

Now through Sept. 19

Tickets from Pitt Arts $69.63 Orchestra,
$60.63 First Tier, $27.50 Second Tier
Grade: B+

It’s pretty common for live shows to slap
the word “spectacular” on their playbills or
advertisement posters, but few warrant the
term as sincerely as the spectacle that is “The
Phantom of the Opera.”

Currently headed into its last week show-
ing live at the Benedum Center, “The Phan-
tom of the Opera” is as close as Pittsburgh
audiences will get to the true New York City
Broadway experience without hopping on
a train to the Big Apple. So if you’ve been

V putting off going to see it, this week is the

time to go.

Fans of the famous musical love triangle
between an opera singer, her mysterious tu-
tor and her young suitor who were ﬁrst ac-
quainted with the 2004 on—screen_ adaptation

/won’t be disappointed. Those who have been

‘longtime fans of the drama of Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s original musical score will appreci-
ate ﬁnally seeing his work performed live.
The most striking and memorable aspect
of PNC Broadway Across America’s Pittsburgh
production is the elaborate stage direction
and scenery. Given the limited space and re-
sources of a theater stage, fans of the Phantom

REVIEW
‘P hantom’ a dazzling affair on stage
Kelsey Shea movie will be startled by how close certain
Staﬁ” Writer scenes come to those in the ﬁlm, including

the boat and dungeon scenes and a larger-
than-life—sized chandelier that swings over

‘ the audience.

While none of the three leads playing
Raoul, the Phantom or Christine blew the
audience away with truly phenomenal vo-
cal or acting performances, all played their
respective parts well. Christine, played by
Trista Moldovan, overacted and ﬂitted around
the stage a bit much for my tastes, but her
voice was right for the part and she gave an
otherwise-errorless performance.

Without Gerard Butler’s charm coloring
the role of the Phantom, I came to the re-
alization that the Phantom is a truly creepy
character. While watching the movie, I recall
thinking that being trapped in alightless dun-
geon forthe rest of my life singing with Gerard
Butler was a hardship I could endure. How-
ever, in the Butler-less stage performance,
Christine’s dilemma is easier to understand
from the audience’s standpoint.

“The Phantom of the Opera” is now on its
farewell tour.

It marked the beginning of the “popera”
movement of wildly popular classically struc-
tured musicals. It’s been lurking around pop
culture for about 20 years and is a staple on
any musical—crazed kid’s iPod. The consola-
tion prize for the Phantom’s farewell is that
Webber is stewing up a sequel called “Love
Never Dies.” Skeptical or not, fans who want
to experience the live “Phantom” ought to
hop to it this week. It won’t be back anytime
soon. I

After a brief upset by Arcade Fire’s The Sub-
urbs, Eminem’s Recovery album returned
to the top of the Billboard Chart last week.
This signiﬁed a restoration of balance in the

natural laws of the pop universe. The people a

crave sensationalism, and Eminem is always
willing to ﬁll the order.

It’s believable that people who listen to
Arcade Fire are also familiar with Eminem’s
music, even if that familiarity might be
ironic. Those who follow rap closely would

other rappers in his songs.

In the song “Talkin”2 Myself” on Recov-
ery, for example, Eminem lends a shout out
to Kanye West, Lil Wayne and T.I. It’s hard
to believe that Eminem is in the same league
as those guys. Naming them on his album
hardly associates him with their music, but
successfully connotes a feeling of celebrity.
And celebrity sells.

People listen to Eminem less for his beats
than for his ability to create controversy.
Because he’s such a loudmouth, even those
who hate him are usually forced to listen.
And people love him because his lyrics-are
full of a combination of inner turmoil and
parody. Taking into account his bashing

MOVIE REVIEW

Chinese ballet drama captivates

The international film appeals to both domestic and international audiences.

Jennifer Hirsch
Staﬁ Writer

“Mao’s Last Dancer”

Starring: Chi Cao, Bruce Greenwood,
Kyle MacLachlan,_]oan Chen

Directed by: Bruce Beresford

Grade: A-- s

Keeping up with the trend of book—based
ﬁlms saturating the movie market, “Mao’s
Last Dancer” opened this past weekend
at CineMagic’s ManorTheatre in Squir-

rel Hill.

It tells the story of Li~Cunxin, a peasant

wckedsfretn ms.I.ho:aerura1 china to
.tr;i1i-11 was ‘Ta 1_a:a1lea‘tffd.aI1i:7ér§.i;.!.1.‘Beijing-I He later

sets up life in the United States.

Two main conﬂicts gracefully weave
throughout the ﬁlm —- Li’s struggle to
ﬁnd success as a professional dancer and
the difﬁculties he encounters as a foreign
national-in Houston. . '

Many ﬁlms based upon just one of
these concepts completely consume the
audience with heart—wrenching dramatic
scenes and provide little relief. But “Mao’s

Last Dancer” skillfully balances the two

plot lines, giving fair play to both the sor-
row of being separated from family and
dazzling ballet routines. H

Newcomer Chi Cao is nothing short of
perfect for the role. His effortless por-
trayal of Li carries the ﬁlm farand over-
shadows the brief moments of sub-par
acting by his co-stars. As Li deﬁantly re-
fuses to return to his home in China when
called upon by the Chinese government,
one would think his romantic interest and
ticketto staying in the.United States could
be better cast.

But Cao still captivates audiences dur-
ing the awkward moments between Li and
his girlfriend and moves the ﬁlm forward.
From the astonishment [of his surround-
ings in a foreign land to confusion over
derogatory slurs, Cao leaves nothing for
want as he convinces audiences that he
is Li Cunxin. As someone who has lived
abroad — in China for that matter -— I
recognize his enthusiastic reactions to
seemingly small matters — “What’s a muf-
ﬁn you say?” — not as overreactions but
as completely natural.

Recognizable faces include Kyle Ma-
cLachlan from “Desperate Housewives”

and Joan Chen of “Lust, Caution.” Their
parts, as Li’s persevering lawyer and for-
lorn mother, respectively, are small gems
in the ﬁlm which only add authenticity to
Cao’s portrayal of the dancer.

I recommend the ﬁlm to anyone who

can appreciate art brought to life. The
movie is completely in English with oc-
casional moments of subtitled Chinese,
meaning viewers can enjoy the acting and
dance scenes with ease. '

I was drawn to the ﬁlm because of its
connection to China and thought I might
get more-out of it for being able to under-
stand Chinese. But as the ﬁlm’ descends
upon topics nearly everyone can relate
to ‘— struggle, love, loneliness,"pa"ssion
and uncertainty + I doubt I gained any
more from it than the man sitting next
to me, who presumably didn’t know the
language.‘ I _

As the weather cools down in the
’Burgh, consider spending an evening
out with “Mao’s Last Dancer” before you
miss your chance. The Manor Theatre has
leased the ﬁlm through Sept 16., with the
possibility of extending it to be decided

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Save CD for an angry day

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

Mt. St._ Helens Vietnam Band

Where the Messengers Meet

Label: Dead Oceans

Grade: B+

Rocks Like: An angrier version of the
Shins V l

Like your indie rock morbid, downtrod-
denand faintly inexplicable? Have we got
a band for you.

Mt. St. Helen’s Vietnam Band offers just
such fare on its sophomore album Where the
Messengers Meet. Forced lyrics and sullen
riﬁ's combine to craft songs of angst-ridden
mediocrity and bitter remorse but isn’t
that sometimes exactly what you’re look-
ing for? '

Much of the album features the acoustic
quality of a bathroom recording, presum-
ably intentional but no less annoying than
a preteen’s YouTube video. Multivocalist
tracks do not so much harmonize as echo in
a ghost-like way, which is a certain achieve-
merit whether you enjoy the aural effect
or not. ’ -
If the listener can get past the lo-ﬁ sound
and severe depressive Vibe, some musical

talent might be lurking. The track “Hurrah” -

could not be less celebratory and yet still
manages to be catchy. Likewise, “At Night”

shows potential with alluring melodies and
strains of surprising string instruments,
but it is held back by nonsensically intense
lyrics that the vocalists present more as
slurred speech than song — “The ﬁre only
burns in your eyes at night  incomprehen-
sible muttering  spider bites.”

“Cadence” is a standout for its reassur-
ingly predictable beat and fairly poetic sub-
ject matter —- analyzing footstep cadence
for relationship compatibility.

Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band offers a
ﬁerce and angry sound that has no place
on your iPod’s shuffle or in daily life, but
it’s album might well suit those certain
dark occasions. I

part of the life that every kid in suburbia has
known at one point or another.
The Suburbs wants us to tap "into our

own culture, but the suburbanites who in- v
ﬂuence Billboard rankings prefer Eminem’s 4

tendency towards self—exposure to Arcade
Fire’s call for self- examination. The kids
don’t want to look at themselves; they want
to watch Eminem fume about personal is-
sues and make drama. On Relapse, his sixth
album, released prior to Recovery, Eminem
rapped about jacking off to Hannah.Montana
and imitated Christopher Reeve. On “The
Eminem Show,”. his third album, Eminem in-
cluded private voicemails from his (alleged)

‘ girlfriend Mariah Carey. Whether the voice

really is Carey’s doesn’t matter. Eminem is
always in a feud or picking a ﬁght. I

On the new album, the feuds are fewer
but the drama still remains. The music video

for the single “Love The Way You Lie” was a A"

spectacle of celebrity, featuring Megan Fox
and Dominic Monaghan. Eminem rapping in
a ﬁeld of wheat is too ridiculous to not watch
for at least a few minutes. He takes himself

4

more seriously, and perhaps tries to make
himself more believable, but the element of
spectacle still remains. Marshall Mathers has
always been known and listened to for his

outrageous personality -— a gimmick that '

continues to work on precedent.
On Recovery, Eminem continuously as-

serts his love of hip-hop and raps about ﬁnd— ’

ing out who he really is. It’s hard to believe
that Eminem ever doubted who he was — a

T musical act who draws attention to himself '

by saying whatever ﬁrst comes to mind.
’ The website Pitchfork.com incorrectly
assessed Recovery as Eminem’s attempt to

restore his 1999—era Slim Shady persona.

It called his attempt to resituate himself
in the pop world a “bizarre spectacle.” The
truth is, Eminem doesn’t seek to be anything
except a spectacle. His success comes from
exposing himself and allowing listeners to
deﬂect attention away from ourselves. With A
every release, he essentially stands up, waves
his arms, and beckons the audience to see
the show. Pop chart rankings fall into place
accordingly. I . _

FOOTBALL

Ptt inds stngt

 

Tonyjovenitti

Assistant Sports Editor

The Panthers picked up their first win on
Saturday, but the team was quick to point
out that it was just one win and there is
room for improvement.

“We have a lot of upside and a lot of
work to do,” head coach Dave Wannstedt
said. “If you watch us play, we’re still not

there yet.”

That applies to both offense and defense,

p even though the Panthers’ game was much

improved from the opening loss at Utah.
Pitt opened up.its passing game as quar-
terback Tino Sunseri made 24 completions
on 34 attempts for 275 yards and two touch-
downs, the longest of which was a 56-yard
pass to Jon Baldwin. It was really a 10-yard

pass that Baldwin ran into the end zone, I

dodging tacklesalong the way.

But the offensestill faces somequestions
with the line, including Dion Lewis. Lewis
was unable to break free on his 10 carries,
gaining only 27 yards. Sunseri was sacked
twice and threw one interception.-

“The thing I want to work on the most is "

picking up the protection,” Sunseri said. “I

want to understand where the blitz is com-
ing from. Teams are going to try and put

pressure on me, and I want to clean that up ’

so it eases things for our offensive line.” »

Ray Graham used his ﬁrst game back
from injury as an opportunity. While Lewis
struggled to get through the line, Graham
racked up 116 yards on nine carries, includ-
ing a touchdown where he broke free for
64 yards. This marked the ﬁrst 1o0—yard
game of his career.

“Teams are going to key in on Dion
[Lewis],” Graham said. “So when I get a
chance or an opportunity to play, I want

. to make.something happen.”

New Hampshire head coach Sean Mc-
Donnell said he didn’t know much about
Graham’s abilities coming into the game.»

“To tell you the truth, I hadn’t.seen
much on [Graham],” he said. “He was il-

lusive withhis schemes, and he took off. »

We talked more about Lewis. And on that
56-yard play, we had our guys blitz, and I
was baﬁled by i .”

The running back’s success is helping

Sunseri ﬁnd his rhythm as the starting

quarterback. _
“Whenever you can have two running
backs with skilllike Dion and Ray, it takes

For the defense, the line showed up in

times, with Chas Alecxih notching three
of them. ’ . I
The pass defense struggled again -

thedefense gave up 283 passing yards and
three passing touchdowns. Saturday, Pitt
allowed 225 yards and one touchdown‘

Wannstedt attributes some of the short-
comings to youth.

“We have so many young players with so
much growth. potential,” Wannstedt said.-
“As long as our players keep working like
we have workedover the p_ast couple of
weeks, we should expect to improve week
after week.’’ . '

He said the team will take a few days off
before it begins preparing for a home bout
against No. 17 Miami — which lost at No. 2
Ohio State lastweek. While Pitt’s ultimate

goal is to win the Big East, Wannstedtlsaid

the team is now focused only on Miami.
“We take it one game at a time, and we

want to be playing ourbest football in De-

cember,” he said. I I

Panthers
struggle ‘
in Ohio  

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team is new
stranger to high levels of competition, es-
pecially in its early-season tournament
schedule. '

But the Panthers still haven’t found a
way to beat that tough competition.

Having already faced Dayton, a nation-
ally ranked team, and multiple teams ac-
customed to appearing in the NCAA Tour-
nament, Pitt traveled to play in the Ohio
University Invitational where. they would
meet more volleyball powerhouses.

Despite Pitt’s exposure to talented teams
in the past, it couldn’t ﬁnd its secondewirﬂ
The Panthers fell to 1-9 on the year.

The invitational welcomed Northwest-
ern and Tennessee, in addition to Pitt and
the host school, Ohio University. l

According to head coach Toby Rens,
each of Pitt’s three opponents has a post-
season schedule in its future.

“Coming into the weekend, we knew the
competition would be a challenge,” Rens
said. “Tennessee is No. 14 in the nation, and
Ohio and Northwestern have been receiving
votes in the national polls as well.” '

For Rens, the main goal for Pitt in the?’
tournament was to “gain experience and
win a few matches,” and although the lat-
ter did not occur, Rens.remains confident
that with each match, the young Pitt team
is “putting it all together.”

In the first match of the tournament, the
Panthers lost to the Bobcats by scores of p
25-12, 25-21 and 25-17. A

tion to her 10 kills as an outside hitter.

“Without a lot of experienced starters
on the team, the burden of leadership can
be great on players like Town,” Rens said.
“However, she has been working hard to

;.,sustain the leadership she shows in practice
‘to her play in the matches.”

Another goal of the Pitt team in the
tournament was to discover weaknesses
that could be addressed during practice
before the start of the Big East Conference
season. 

The loss to Ohio revealed that blocking,
especially for points, might be a missing
link in the Panthers’ search for success.

While the Bobcats collected 12 blocks
over the three sets, the Panthers came away
with just one.

, “Ourblocking will deﬁnitely be a focal
point this week,” Rens said. “That aspect of
our game will help our defense at the net,
while allowing us to score a few points in
the process.”

AN ‘OLTMANNS OPINION

Reggie Bush’s
punishments  
over the top

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

Judging by the punishments being lev-
ied on former USC running back Reggie
Bush, you would think he was convicted
of murder. . .  . _ _
His jersey was taken down at-the Los-
Angeles Memorial Coliseum,Vthe sehool’s
copy of the Heisman Trophy was removed

" and Bush’s name was stripped from all

school facilities and publications, as in-
structed by the NCAA.

What’s next? Are people on the USC
campus going to be banned from speak-
ing his name? '

No, he was not convicted of a crime.
Instead, he was found to have received
improper benefits from the school with
.gifts ranging from a house to ﬂights to

hotel accommodations.

This is obviously a major NCAA_viola- .

tion. But is it just me, or is everyone act-
ing like Bus'h was the first college athlete
to accept benefits he shouldn’t have?

Bush — who is currently with the
defending Super Bowl champion‘New_
Orleans Saints e wasn’t-the first'atl_1-.
lete to do it, and he deﬁnitely won’t be
the last. ’

Allegedly, schools all across the coun-
try are doing it. Reports say that the
NCAA is investigating-North Carolina,
South'Carolina, Tennessee and Florida.

handed and they, along with Bush, are
paying for it with a two-year bowl ban.
But now, with reports that the Heis-
man Trophy Trust might strip Bush of
the trophy he won in 2005, thisgis just
getting ridiculous. - ”
_ 'I’m not saying that Bush shouldn’t be
punished, because-he should. be. But re-

moving any traceof him on" the entirety

of campus'isn’t right. i ,

How can the NCAA try to pretend like
Bush’s greatness at the school from 2.003-
05 wasn’t one of the best things to happen
to the sport in the last decade?

From his highlight reel runs, Pac-10
Championships and Heisman Trophy,
no matter how much the NCAA tries to
erase our memory of him, it’s just not-
possible.

Let’s take a look at another Heisman
Trophy winner who just so happened
to be a USC running back himself: 0.].
Simpson.

Simpson was acquitted of murder in
what was arguably the most controver-
sial trial in the past 30 years.'But let’s be
honest: the public hasn’t forgotten the
proceedings.

You would think his Heisman Trophy
would’ve been removed from USC’s tro-
phy case as well.

It wasn’t. . -

-To add insult to injury, the NCAA is
reportedly considering giving Bush’s '_

Heisman to Vince Young, who finished '

second in the voting that season.

Now I don’t want to make any assump-
tions, but isn’t it ironic that Young, who
posted one of the all—time lowest scores
on the NFL’s Wonderlic Test that mea-

‘sures problem—solving abilities, would

get the award? With that kind of score, it
makes one wonder how Young managed
to graduate. ‘ S '

If anything, the NCAA should take it

* easy on Bush; Don’t they know that he

just went through a highly publicized
breakup with Kim Kardashian? ;

But in all seriousness, the NCAA is
making a mistake in the extent of their
penalties. . ' T .

Maybe they should spend more time
looking into reports that West Virginia
allegedly violated NCAA rules during the

Rich Rodriguez era, instead of focusing

Volleyball 4 16
against Ohio, Pitt was shut out again by
Northwestern in set scores of 25-17, 25-21
and 25-22. g

Town’s performance continued from the

- Ohio match as she totaled 14 kills and seven

digs, while some young Panthers came into
the match to gain experience.

» Sophomore ‘Alexa Campbell recently
excelled in Pitt’s last tournament, and
she continued her level of success against
Northwestern..

With 12 kills and 10 digs, Campbell
earned her ﬁrst double-double. Another
sophomore, Michelle Walker, posted nine

 H kills in the ‘match.

“Campbell and Walker have been pro-
gressing well this season, especially given
theirlimited amount of experience,” Rens

said. “It is one thing for them to perform

well in practice, but it is much different

to see that carry over to matches against _

good teams.” .

Rens is particularly excited" about the
future of Walker, an outside hitter who
missed much of the spring season while
recovering from foot surgery.

“Walker is not at 100 percent yet, but a

she had a good match and that is deﬁnitely
promising for the remainder of the sea-
son.” ‘

Tennessee 3, Pitt 1
The Panthers ended their play in the tour-

nament with their best match, as they took
a set from No. 14 Tennessee.

<=°a°hiugg'ing'ineu-is

Lucas Felalcl Senior Staff Photographer
Amy Town must be the team’s leader while facing top-tier opponents.

After a ﬁrst-set 25-19 loss, the Panthers
came back to take the second set 25-21.

The third set went to 26-24, but infavor
of the Volunteers, who won the fourth set
25-17 to win the match. ‘

In the loss, Rens found out a lot about
his team. 1

“We have the ability to compete with
these teams that are ranked,” Rens said.

“Although our goal is to win matches, these _

kind of challenges give us an opportunity to
mature and measure up to the best teams
in the country.” ' ‘

Defensively, the Panthers beat the Vol-
unteers in terms of digs, thanks to the 28
recorded by Acton.

“Acton had an outstanding match,” Rens
said. “We will continue to work on defense,

but this match was a good indicator of ‘how

far we have come.” ‘ .
Town had a productive match as well:
she ﬁnished with a game~leading 21 kills.
This also set a career mark for Town.
Still, the weaknesses of the Panthers were
apparent as they once again lost the block-
ing contest and committed 10 serviceter—
rors. ‘ ‘ V‘
“Our serving game is another thing that
will be addressed,” Rens said. “Working

on serving, ‘blocking, and our transition

game will help us as we continue to move
forward.” a ‘ ' _ ‘ ' ‘
The Panthers will return to match"
play when they host No. 9 Washington on
Thursday as part of Pitt’s Blue and Gold

‘Tournament that will run until Saturday.I - A
