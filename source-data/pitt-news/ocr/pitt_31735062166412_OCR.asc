“It's tough,” Lee syrnpathizes, “for

a college senior to feel conﬁdent about ‘

choosing a job. For four years hels
been trained to be critical and delib-

erate about making decisions. Now,
faced with the biggest decision of all,
he has only a few months in which to
attend job interviews, separate the
facts from the propaganda, and select
a company—not to mention passing
exams and graduating at the same
time.”

Lee, with a B.S. in Industrial Ad-
ministration, came to IBM in 1953.
Starting as a Technical Engineerin
Production Control, he was immedi-
ately assigned to the General Manu-
facturing Education program-a

I

Designing cu paperwork system

10-month course with rotating as-
signments ‘in all phases of the work
-—manufacturing, purchasing, pro-
duction. In addition to four weeks of
formal classroom study, he also spent
two in the Boston Sales Office, calling
on accounts with the IBM salesmen.

Lee’s career was temporarily inter-
rupted by a two-year hitch with the
Air Force in Korea. Back at IBM
in 1955, he has since been pro-
moted to Production Control Engi-
neer. His present job is to design

paperwork systems to insure a smooth '

ﬂow of work through the plant where
the famous IBM electronic computers
are manufactured.~“It takes creative
engineering ability to design these
systems,” says Lee, “and it takes
administratiize ability to ‘sell’ a sys-

_ tem to higher management and make
it stick.” ‘"4

ELECTRIC TYPEWRITERIS 9

“What’s it like to be     *
A MANUFACTURING ENGINEER

AT IBM?"

Four years ago, Yale senior lee Baker asked himself this question:
Today, as a Product Control Engineer in IBM Manufacturing Engineering,
Lee reviews his experience and gives some pointers that may be helpful
to you in taking the ﬁrst, most important step in your engineering career.

How to-select an employer

To the college senior faced with a
job decision, Lee has this to say:
“Pick your employer bythis simple
test: ‘Is the company expanding fast

" enough to provide adequate scope

for your talents and ambitions? Is it
interested in your long-range man-
agement development? Will it treat

“Se mg" the system
you as an individual and match your

abilities with the most challenging
assignments?’ ” *

For his part, Lee feels IBM has
met this test. Since 1953, he has seen
new plants open, dozens of new prod-
ucts evolve, hundreds of new man-
agement positions created. Greater
authority, responsibility and reward
have ‘come his way. And he knows
they will continue, for IBM sales

 

Recognition of individual merit

have been doubling on the average
every ﬁve years since 1930. He likes
the “sma1l—team” engineering system
that assures ready recognition of indi-
vidual merit. And he appreciates the

‘fact that IBM hired him despite his

impending -service hitch.

What's “life” like ‘at IBM?
At IBM, Poughkeepsie, Lee lives
a “full life.” He belongs to a local
sports car group, drives an Austin
Healy. He skis at. Bromley. He is a
member of the IBM Footlighters and
a local drama workshop. At present,
he shares an’ apartment with two
other engineers and a “medium-ﬁ”
set, but plans to marry‘ “the girl
next door” (in hometown Hamburg,
Conn.), in the very near future. In
this connection, Lee advises seniors
to pay special attention to company
benefits. “They may seem like a.
yawning matter when you’re single,
but they mean a lot when you as-
sume responsibilities. IBM’s are the
best I know

IBM hopes that this message will help to‘
‘give you some idea of what it’s like to
work in Manufacturing Engineering at
IBM. There are equal opportunities for

, E.E.’s, M.E.’s, physicists, mathemati-

cians and Liberal Arts majors in IBM's

Why not drop in and discuss IBM with

Dr. Frankel Discusses
Scholarship, Society

Dr, Charles Frankel, chairman of the Department of
Philosophy at Columbia University, spoke on the role of
scholarship in our contemporary society on Scho1ar’s Day

last Monday.

Frankel began by telling the scholars that he was not a

believer in the credo that knowledge, like virtue, is a spiritual .
requires noO~-—-

good, and as such,
recognition.

Like Wedding
Frankel remarked humorously
that Scholars Day, like weddings

and/or funerals is an excuse to
have a party.

To continue the analogy, he
added that the attention of the
group is not ﬁxed on the central
individuals to the exclusion of
everyone else. We have a cumu-
lative heritage of scholastic con-
vocations, notable even in the
colorful garb of the scholars.
Furthermore, the honor goes to

the entire scholastic community.

Frankel conceded that many
Americans hold an “antipathy”
to intellectual life. The intel-
lectual life for most Americans,
excepting those who become so
excited by it that they become
teachers, is in preparation for

economic and social advance-
ment. These motives, dating to

the aristocracy in Europe, are
not new and must not be dis-
paraged.

However, when one considers
the amount of money spent on
education, Frankel asserted that
we would be “spending too much”
for social and economic advance-
ment,-were these our only aims.
These motives are not enough
reason to “make scholars out of
wou1d—be gentlemen.”

Provides Material

The twentieth century univers-
ity, as Frankel said, provides ‘for
the material and technical pro-
gress, the product of its education.
It would be “sentimental and
thoughtless” to say that material
beneﬁt is not coupled with moral
beneﬁt.

. Education For life .

Every year at this time, honoraries tap and award stu-
dents for their outstanding work in various extra—curricular
activities. These students have also shown worthwhile aca-
demic records. It is not for just one of these accomplish-
ments that the recognition is made, but for equal endeavor
in both areas. '

The awards are particularly signiﬁcant this year for
their appropriateness under the new philosophies on edu-
cation taking solid shape at Pitt. The concept of making the
University an organic whole is being centered in the devel-
opment of a well-rounded student, a student who is char-
acterized by an ambition to participate in social relation-
ships under work conditions in addition to the ambition of
studying for his degrees. '

To these students a degree from the University means
much more than the culmination of four years of concen-
trated academic effort. “ _ _

"The degree now means a completed course in living.
These students are using the opportunities they have paid
for in'this University. They are sampling the life which

they will be expected to take as leaders in their communi-

ty. They are preparing not only for success intheir pro-
fession but success in their community. The two are be-
coming more and more closely related in modern living. A
man is no longer a slave to his job. His free time is being
dedicated to the community in which he lives. The com-
munity from which he derives the beneﬁt of social contact.
It is certainly the duty of every student to insure himself
in this area of his life. It is the duty of the University to
provide training in this area. ‘i »

The University is meeting its responsibility to the stu-
dents. Today we have honored those students who have
met their responsibility to themselves.

Student Congress Woes . . .

Out pf the Dil

y ‘Dave Bender

(Editor’s Note--This is the first in a series of
columns by this year’s Student Congress President
Dave Bender. His columns will concern the pro-
blems of student government at Pitt.)

Although student government has long been
hailed by educators as a major component of edu-
cation, yet no one conception has caused so many
problems or been so much a topic of discussion
among students and administrators. Jurisdiction of
and limits on student control is a major argument
even in schools where government by students has
been long established and ac-
cepted.

A popular solution among
some administrators is top level
control. Ultimately, they ration-
alize, the results of student ac-
tion, many bad, are placed upon
them. Why then, should they not
have the ﬁnal word on what stu-
dents may do. If student gov-
ernment does exist under them,
it exists only in name. It may be a sounding board
of student thought, or it may merely be the group
which carries out all the “busy work” that the ad-
ministration needs to accomplish its programs.
Mo|Iin'g\Decisions , .

Under this policy students are often led to be-
lieve that they are actually making decisions when
they are asked to approve measures already de-
cided on by the administration. Control from the
top echelons manifests ﬁne results for the administra-
tion. Few mishaps occur which they can not im-
mediately curtail. A standardization of activities
follows, and busy students add to the glossy eﬁect.
Even some educational factors exist.‘ Students learn

by doing; they come in contact with other students
and learn to be social beings; and they learn to fol-
low policy and tradition. But do students learn to
think? Obviously they do not.

Thinking students are not long fooled by these
tactics. Traditions and policies soon become mean-
ingless as they lose interest and become discon-
tented. The real value of student government as
an-educational device is lost as scholars succumb
to an I.B.M. notch.

Issuing Authortiy

Fortunately major universities are delivering
themselves from this dilemma by issuing students
real authority and integrating them into policy mak-
ing committees. Surprising to some educators, they
have proven themselves to be more than capable.

Campus living can only be satisfactorily gov-
erned by all existing factors, students, faculty, and
administrators. This premise leads to students more
completely in jurisdiction of their own affairs, and

     

5

participating in educational, athletic and adminis-S

trative decisions.
Why should students, for example, not help de-

cidetwhat the curriculum for the school year will .

be? And should they not help determine the poli-
cies for regulations to be imposed on students liv-
ing in the dorms? Certainly, in spite of limited ex-
perience, they are capable of thinking and ex-
pressing student attitudes. If students do not learn
to govern themselves and determine to a great ex-
tent matters affecting them while they are in col-
lege, they are not adequately being prepared to
take their places in society. '

A very basic concept is involved. Should not
the American university consider its product as
capable and responsible -as it would like others to
believe? '

lnclependence A Goal .

Light Through

By Esther Latterman

Several weeks ago I took a
tour of the Western Pennsyl-
vania School For Blind Chil-
dren, and I found this tour to
be a most enjoyable experience.
The excellent work which is

done with the blind children to,

prepare them for all walks of
life helped to make this tour a
pleasant one.

Independence and useful citi-
zenship are the goals set for the
students. These goals are ac-
complished by the children aid-
ed by patience, understanding
and specialized training, all of
which the 100 men and women
on the School’s staff have in
generous quantities.

Hands Do Work

The hands of a blind child lit-
erally hold the key to this world
of light, He is taught to make
his hands do the work for him
that a sighted person’s eyes do

 

expensive solution of eliminat-

ing some of this unpleasantness

in the food palace. Instead of

employing the music of a com-
ing name attraction to a dance
just for a week prior to that
dance, why not keep the rhythm
flowing throughout the year?

In answer to those who at this
point are wondering how music
can improve the bad lighting or
poor ventilation, we ‘agree. It
can not. However, new lights
cost a good amount of money,
money that the administration—
it seems-—is reluctant to spend.

Music, a good variety of it,
can make the students forget
some of these drawbacks the
Tuck possesses. Right now, tunes
are piped into the Hunt Room
of the Student Union, where an
altogether different atmosphere
than in the Cathedral “restau-
rant” prevails. That is one pos-
sibility for bringing the melodies
into the Tuck.

However, the livelier method
would be to have “all the big
stars there on record, of course,”
as the leading disc jockeys of
the day advertise. This would
take more space, but could be
more worthwhile. And there is
a very simple solution as to
whom could operate the records
and record player.

Considering that the majority
of ‘booths in the Blue Tuck are

0 O -
L '  
earning

for him. Those sensitive, in-
quiring ﬁngers reveal the mean-
ing in thousands of dots in a
Braille book.

At the age of six, children are
taught to write Braille on a
braille writer. Comparable to a
typewriter, the machine has six
keys, one for each of the six
dots in a braille “cell” plus a
large space bar.

Girls are taught proper ap-
plication of lipstick, set their
hair, and achieve the elements
of good grooming. Boys are en-
couraged in such sports as
wrestling, which is one sport in
which the blind can compete on
an equal and favorable basis
with the sighted.

Swimming Lessons
Among the physical ,educa-

tional classes 'which I observed ’

included swimming instruction,
which is an important part in
the physical education program,
and also appeared to be one of

used by fraternity and sorority
sections, with no one raising too
much fuss about it, it would
only be reciprocable of the
Greek organizations to aid in the
atmospheric improvement of the
Tuck. ~

Student DJ's

In this way each week one

booth would play “disc jockey,”‘i

and take charge of the records

and phonograph that could be.

furnished by the school -either
free or at a._ minimum cost. Of’
course, platters of individual-
fraternity and sorority members
could be used for variety from
week to week.

By rotating the disc jockey
job a continuous playing of a
single type of music could be
avoided. The location of the
equipment could be in one of
two places.

It could be put in the sponsor-
ing booth, or if this would cause
too much confusion‘ and incon-
venience, a small section of the

Tuck Shop could be set aside for’

just this purpose.

One dance remains on the
school calendar. This is ‘the
Spring Festival dance, for which
the music-publicity will un-
doubtedly’ be used. Give a listen
and decide whether you would
like somebody like Julie Lon-
don accompanying you as you
grab that quick bite of lunch.

the most popular activities
among sightless boys and girls.

The lives of the blind conﬁrm
what ‘the school has always
taught. They do not want pity,
they need understanding; they
do not want charity, they need
a chance.

These opportunities are given
to them in the many crafts and
skills which they learn. I ob-
served classes in handicraft,
broom making, and switchboard
and typewriter operating. The
students are also given academic
work to prepare them to enter
college.

And so it goes. The children’s
busy ﬁngers never stop or falter.
Aided by the senses of taste,
hearing, and smell, they replace
ignorance with knowledge, sub-
stitute conﬁdence for despair,
and ignore the handicap in favor
of new found capabilities. Thus,
darkness is pierced by light‘
through education.

' Symphony Leader 

Says Past Great
Was Re—Creator

“It is difﬁcult to discuss Tos-
canini,” said William Stein-
berg, who speaks rarely, gave

"burgh Symphony Orchestra.

“You deal not with a creator,
but with a re-creator.
Recognizing that those who cre-
ate worthy works are remembered
more than those who interpret
them, Steinberg expressed what

he felt to be Toscanini’s historical 

worth: “he created a certain
standard of performance.” “The
Maestro” showed how works of
art should be performed.
Steinberg, a personal friend of
Toscanini who passed away Janu-
ary 16, spoke at the Toscanini Me-
morial Program sponsored Sunday
evening in Foster Memorial by
the Pitt Hillel Foundation.
-_ Given Long Life
T h e world - renowned Pitts-
burgh" conductor reminded the
audience that had Toscanini lived
for two more months, he would
have been 90 years old. “God must
have loved him.” For Toscanini
was born in 1867, a signiﬁcant era
for music, and was given long life
to enhance -the growth of music
appreciation.

Rossini was very young, Puc-
cini had not yet written his
greatest works, Verdi had only
completed his ﬁrst success and
had not composed “Aida,” the
young Strauss was only three
years old when “The Maestro”
was born. Their growth and
Toscanini’s presence proved to
be a fortunate circumstance. He
introduced Strauss and Wagner

' to Italy; he was the ﬁrst to pre-
sent “Pagliacci.” The world was
early acquainted with his abili-
ties. .

Of Toscanini’s infamous tem-

. perament,_ S t e i n b e r g stated,

“Nothing gave him greater pleas-

ure thanpto relate how terrible a

temper he had.”

Blew Up

However, during one NBC Sym-
phony rehearsal, when Toscanini
blew up, yelling and screaming,
-and threw away his baton, Stein-
berg approached him rather forth-
rightly. “Papa, today I don’t be-
lieve you!” Surprised, Toscanini
screamed a terrifying “Why?”
Steinberg answered in effect: As
long as your white spot (on the
head)" remains white, you joke;
when it gets red, you are really
angry. Toscanini laughed and ad-
mitted a “put-up” job.

“Toscanini was really funny,”
his disciple continued. Watching
the ﬁrst prints of the movie
“Hymn of Nations,” produced af-
ter Italy was freed of Fascist
rule in 1944, Toscanini watched
himself perform on ﬁlm. Turning
to Steinberg he cried out, “Quella
Bruta face!”

Toscanini was not only a
genius of music, but he became
a political ﬁgure, though not a
politician. W h e n .Mussolini’s
government took over Italy, the
director refused to play the
fascist hymn and even refused
to play before the Italian dicta-

, tor. According to ‘Steinberg,
Toscanini “picked the ﬁght, not
the Fascists.”

"‘The Maestro” fought against
any sort of fascism, from the po-
litical dictator to the self—centered
opera prima donna. His ﬁght
against political fascism required
constant public manifestation. He

took the rostrum to conduct and
speak out as best he could against
tyranny. It was a “duty” to dem-
onstrate. -

According to Steinberg, “His
political art was at one with the
artistic.” ‘

Met in 1938

It was in 1938 that director
Steinberg ﬁrst met director Tos-
canini. Chased from Italy, Tos-
canini, welcomed the. opportunity
to conduct the Palestine Sym-
phony Orchestra which had been
founded by Steinberg and the vio-
linist Hauberman.

At the time, Steinberg, too, was
an exile, having been chased from
Hitler’s Germany.

Toscanini conducted in the
cities and took the symphony to
the collective colonies in the
desert. He contributed toward
the growth of culture and con-
tributed to fulﬁlling the thirst
of the peoples for the art.

The symphony has since become
the Israeli Philharmonic Orches-
tra. v

Impressed with director Stein-
berg’s artistry, Toscanini invited
him to come to the United States.
Steinberg’s ﬁrst position was as
associate director of the NBC
Symphony Orchestra. Steinberg
then conducted the Buffalo Sym-
phony and in..1952 came to Pitts-
burgh as the eminent conductor of
the now world-famous Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra.

One of Steinberg’s jobs as as-
sociate director under Toscanini
was the “musicians, I consoled
them.”

Spoiled by the world, Tos-
canini was never satisﬁed. “To.
a great artist, perfection is nev- ,
er achieved to the last,” Stein-
berg stated. Toscanini’s scruples
were extremenly high. On one
occasion, “The Maestro” asked
Steinberg to conduct a Beethov-
en symphony instead of he. The
reason, in effect: “I am not in a
position tonight to conduct the
way it should be conducted.”

In his concluding remarks on
the world’s most profound musical
recreator, Steinberg referred to
Jacob’s debate with the angel in
the Bible. Jacob inured, “I will
not let thee go except thou bless
me.” The Pitstburgh conductor
stated, “He "taught us how to
wrestle with the angels.” Tosca-
nini surely did, himself.

2 Maestro Speaks

 

 

At Toscanini Fete
On Music, Funds»

After his forty-ﬁve minute
lecture on Toscanini Sunday
evening, Dr. William Stein-
berg who speaks rarely, gave
some impressions of music,
audiences, and Pittsburgh.

In the Foster Memorial social
hall, he observed that it is “a
complicated game of chess putting
on a symphony season.” It takes
almost a half a year to plan a
successful program and, of course,
funds.‘

Get Funds

Queried on whether the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra will
get the necessary funds for con-
tinunity, the director remarked,
“I’m already planning next sea-
son. I have faith in the people of
Pittsburgh.”

Steinberg spoofed the general
‘attitude that Europe is more
culturally interested than people
of this country. “Impossible. The
culturallinterest in America is
much greater than that of Eu-
rope.” .

“Where in all of Europe would
a city the size of Pittsburgh have
7,000 people per week seeing the
symphony?” He pointetl out how
much smaller music auditoriums
are in Europe than here.

Music Lovers

In his usual, jovial humor, the
world-educated director who has
conducted in Germany, Italy,
Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Canada,
the Middle East, and throughout
the United States, ‘seemed opti-
mistic about the increasing num-
bers of people who are enjoying
symphony music.

To say that people in Italy
are more music-minded» than
those here, is an impossible saga,
he said in effect. “Just because
someone goes up the street sing-
ing ‘il done mobile’ is no rea-
son to suspect he appreciates
music.”

People in America whistle too,
Steinberg observed; but “for a
different reason,” he mused.

It is important that the Sy1n—
phony bring young artists to per-
form with the Pittsburgh artists
to give them an opportunity to
grow artistically, the director ob-
served. He felt that a combination
of name soloists “who are fortu-
nately also artists” and young
talent would "provide a consistent-
ly attractive program for music-
goers.

Steinberg spoke earlier in the_
evening during the Toscanini
Memorial Program sponsored‘ by
the University of Pittsburgh Hillel
Foundation.

50th Anniversary Today

‘The Pitt YMCA will celebrate its 50th Anniversary on
Wednesday, May 1 with a banquet at East Liberty Presby-
terian Church. Mr, Charles H. Bode, ’l0 will speak on student
life at the time the YMCA began in 1905-06. The new student
cabinet and officers will be installed. l\/Ir. William L. Jones,

leadership of senior students: C.
Meade Beers, Jr., President;
Anthony Traﬁcante, Vice-Presi-
dent; and student cabinet mem-
bers Emilio Fastuca, John Hodak,
Ed Johnson and William Kelly.

The Pitt Y_MCA began in
the University along with
other student activities which
were started about the same
[time such as football, fraterni-
ties, the Owl and many others.
Program emphases in the early
days dealt with mission study
groups, intercollegiate confer-
ences, reception for new stu-
dents, providing student leader-
ship for daily Chapel services,
and publication of the Fresh-
man Handbook, the forerunner»
of the Compass and the Polaris.

In 1918 the Pitt Association be-
came a branch of the metropol-
itan Pittsburgh YMCA. During
World War I a hut was built on
Thackeray Street as a social cen-
ter for military students. After
World War I, the Pitt YMCA took
over operation of the “Hut” which
until 1938, was the social and
meeting center for the campus.

The YMCA pioneered in many
program areas such as Freshman

Camp which was started in 1931,,

student employment bureau, re-
ligious emphasis weeks, student-
faculty relations, and others.

In a recent survey of alumni,
four aspects df the YMCA pro-
gram stood out in their minds: in-
tercollegiate conferences, and re-
treat discussion groups, religious
leaders brought to campus, and
personal friendships.

Jones will also speak on.’

‘I00’ Duel To Highlight
Panther - Cadet Classic

3 Coach Carl Olson’s thinclads will try for their second_

consecutive road victory, and

third straight dual meet win

of the season, this Saturday when they run the Army Cadets

at’ West Point, N.Y.

Last year, the Blue and Gold cindermen humbledthe
Black Knights of the Hudson on a cold, wet afternoon at

the Stadium, 71-60, and.they ap-3

pear strong enough to take the
Army again if the weight men
come through.
Coach Olson approached the
meets last  .  .
3 year with op-
timism f o 1'
his runners
and pessim-
ism for his
weight men.
So far this
year, he has
had some-

    

good about in
each because

01
t 11 e a a a e a 5°“
points resulting from sound ﬁeld
performances has immensely

helped get two impressive wins
for the Blue and Gold.

The biggest surprise of the in-
fant outdoor campaign in the
weights has been the efforts of
Wes King in the discus.

"King, ‘a big, strong sophomore
from Greensburg, won the discus

‘ throw in both the Miami (Ohio)

and Navy battles. Against Miami,
King tossed the discus over 149
feet to eclipse the old stawlard of
148 feet set by Gibby Welch in
1927. x

The Navy meet found the Pan-
ther strong boy heaving the
weight only 135 feet, but he was
probably ‘less concerned about
bettering his record because the
Jungle Cats had the team victory
assured when he stepped into the
throwing circle.

Another weight man that has
greatly strengthened the Pan-
others is Corny Salvaterra, ex-
Panther football star who guid-
ed the football team into their
second straight post-season bowl
game last year.

Salvaterra did not compete in

I J 1956 because of an ankle injury.

This year, though, he has capably
demonstrated his point value by
throwing the spear approximately
185 feet against the Midshipmen.
Although this only earned him
second place, it should be good
enough to take ﬁrst place in most
of the remaining dual meets.

polis, Md., on May 11 by easi-

ly defeating West Virginia’s
Mountaineers, 90, at Morgantown
yesterday afternoon.

.. The victory over the Ridgerun-
ner golfers put the season’s re-
cord at 5-0, and has_ earmarked
‘the Blue and Gold linkers as de-
ﬁnite contenders f or Eastern
honors.

The top man for the Panthers
—— Ron Schwarzel —- continues
to pace the team with his superb
shooting which, if he continues,
could return him individual
honors at the Easterns. .

After the Eastern classic, the
locals will have to get past three
more foes in order to achieve an
unbeaten season.

The remainder of the schedule
shows meets carded with West
Virginia and Duquesne at home,
and Penn State at University
Park.

 

Bill Smith, a senior from Butler,
has been his usual ‘self in the
pole vault, winning with a jump
of 12 feet, 8 inches at Miami and
improving with a vault of 13 feet,
2 inches in the Navy tussle.

The highlight of the Army
meet should occur in the 100-
and 220-yard dashes where the
Jungle Cats will send aces Herb
Carper, Jim Donahue, and Jay
Moody against Cadet sensation
Bob Kyasky who also doubles
as a football halfback during
the grid ser son. ,

Normally Carper) would be rat-
ed the most likely of the sprinters
to take the century, but lately he
has been bothered by a lame leg,
and it is questionable if the fleet
Panther can generate enough
speed to nip Kayasky or Donahue.
Donahue, who comes from Cen-
tral Catholic, edged Carper in the
Navy affair, but it was clearly

visible that Carper was concern-

ed more about his injured leg
than he was about winning. Coach
Olson had ordered him to “run
only as hard as he feels like.”

If the weather is warm at West
Point on Saturday, Carper, Kya-
sky, and Donahue ‘could very well
ﬁnish only inches apart, and pos-
sibly establish a new record for
the Army course.

Commenting on the team’s play,

Panthers Get 14 Safeties

By MURRAY CHASS
Keeping in line with most baseball coaches or managers,
the Panthers’ Bobby Lewis displayed his elation after his
mittmen ‘had just trampled the Westminster Titans yester-

beamed. “I knew we had a

great ball club, and I knew that if we got the good weather

and played some
would start hitting.”

Of course, Lewis had more rea-

Jungle Cats 43 runs on 45 hits in

which they won.

a defeat, stumped the Titans
throughout the ﬁrst ﬁve innings,
giving up only two hits. He
momentarily weakened in the
next two frames as the visitors
scored their initial tally in the
sixth and a pair in the seventh.

The Panther captain struck out
seven Titans and walked two, a
big comedown from thewildness
that usually plagues him.

Dunlap Scores Four Runs

Although Coach Lewis felt that
everyone played good ball, a
quartet of mitters did the most
to make the Westminster visit an
unpleasant one. Ron Hoover, sop-
homore leftﬁelder, and Corky
Cost, a delightful surprise thus
far, led in run production, as both
batted in ﬁve tallies apiece.

Slugging Joe Walton, who is
making a better-than-average
try for double All-American,

had a say in scoring and batting
in runs. His total for each de-
partment was three. Jim Dun-
lap crossed the plate four times
during the run"-away.
No sooner had Titan Joe Bleggi
taken the mound in the ﬁrst inn-

ing than the Panthers had the,

game nearly won. With two down,
Dunlap started the hitting with a
triple to left. Walton received his
ﬁrst of four walks and with
Hoover at bat started for second.
Second baseman Will Duvall cut
off the throw from catcher George
James and tried to get Dunlap at
home.

Panthers Rally

But James dropped the ball and
the Panther shortstop was in with

i the ﬁrst of three unearned runs.

Hoover brought Walton over with
a triple, and he himselfscored on
Cost’s line single to left.
The second and third frames
proved to be as “long” for the
Titan hurlers. Reliefer Bob Du-
vall passed Bob Jaxel, Dunlap,
and Walton and gave up a single
to George Schoeppener-in be.-
’ tween for one run. Then Hoover
and Cost, the sluggers of the
day, hit consecutive singles to
drive in three more Panthers.
Four walks to Moog, J axel,
Schoeppener, and naturally Wal-
ton, and a wild pitch by the third
Westminster pitcher of the game,
Norm Paxton, delivered another

L trio of runs in the third.

First Solid Hit

Paxton‘ continued his wildness
in the following
nicked backstop Fred DeLost with
a pitched ball. After Moog popped
to short, Jaxel slammed out a
liner to left that went for a triple
when Sylvester Miele_slip,ped and
fell. Two men later, Walton ﬁnal-
ly got a chance to swing at the
horsehide and dribbled I one
through the inﬁeld to bring over
Jaxel.

In the Titan sixth Steve Kos-
ko, third baseman, got the ﬁrst
solid hit off the bespectacled

Second of a Series if . A
Guard, Center Spots
Provide Line Fortes

Dan Wisniewski, Ed Michaels, John Guzik, and Nick
Carr will bang each other around in the Fall for the two
starting guard posts. Nothing could make Coach John
Michelosen and Panther grid fans any happier.

There is no reason for this to be true except that all
four of these boys have had past experience on the gridiron
and make up just aboutthe strongest position on the local eleven.

First of all, Wisniewski, who decided to return next year
and use up his playing eligibility, teamed up with graduating
Vince Scorsone at the two starting guard guard positions in 1956.
Thus, Michelosen has a veteran starter, "a rarity on the squad
for the coming season. A

The blond Wisniewski, who is the “voice” of the
strong defensive game, and ac-
cording to the head mentor, he
has overcome the over-anxious-
ness that plagued him last season.

Behind Wisniewski on the
right side of the center is Carr,
another letterman.  219-pounder
from Charleston, W. Va., Carr. has
- more speed this year and has bet-
ter agility.

Right now it is a tossup be- '
tween Michaels and Guzik for the left guard slot. Guzik set out
most of last year-—-so much did he sit out, in fact that he was
granted an extra year of play by the Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference (ECAC). ‘He was in against West Virginia, the open-
er for 1956, for a short time when be injured his arm.

Then this Spring it was Michael’s turn to wear a cast on his
arm, as he had an operation on the wing.

S Still he ma_naged to get in a little practice on offense. Although
he weighs only 190 pounds, Michaels is described by Michelosen as a
“tremendously hard worker.”

Guzik, at 230 pounds and the heaviest among the guards, has
good speed.. The man at the top, however, feels that Guzik could
use some more experience in actual play.

Other left guard possibilities are Don Crafton, a senior, and
Nort Seaman, a newcomer. Crafton goes at-'195 pounds and Seaman

team plays a

1;.” v

    

. weighs in at 205. The latter is also the possible replacement for

Bags Bagamery in the kicking department. Seaman’s_ kicking off
and extra-point booting was the best during the past drills.
Bob Longfellow and Henry Suffoletta are two candidates for the

,_right side, but both have been hit with recent injuries. Ed Mombich,

who is a product of South High in Pittsburgh, comes to Skyscraper

» .U. from William and Mary for a crack at the position.

Michelosen sees a deﬁnite rise in the guard stock. “Last year
we had lost considerable guard strength from 1955,” he states,
“but now we have the boys back for another season.”

The middle of the line is another place where no worry pre-
vails. The other co-captain of the team, Charley Brueckman, has
that all for himself, although no fault of the other centers. Brueckman
averaged 53 minutes a game in 1956, and has been -mentioned as a
good bet for All-American honors in the approaching, year.

The 220-pound blond is said to be an outstanding defensive grid-
der, and of course a ﬁne offensive stalwart.

While Brueckman is a senior, Michelosen has replacements
ready for the next two years, 1958 and 1959. ~ The junior is Tom
Salwocki, a lctterman from Connecticut. Michelosen, in regard
to Salwocki, says, “He has come a long way and looked stronger
defensively in the Spring. He will make a capable sub for
Brueckman.”

Fifth Win, 16-3

(Continued from Page 6)

eventualy scored on a triple by
James.

The Panthers weren’t ﬁnished
scoring, though, as they put across
four more in the lower half of the
sixth on four singles and a walk.
The heat appeared to get the bet-
ter of Moog in the seventh as he
gave up a double to Jack Pogue,
a single to Glenn Smith-younger
brother of the.Pirates’ Paul Smith
—and walks to Miele and Don
Wix, good for two tallies. He also
included his own throwing error.

This total of 16 runs eclipsed
the previous season high of 15 for
the Panthers, which was reached
Monday against the California
Teachers. In the 15-6 win, Carl
Lindstrom did just about every-
thing possible as he went the full
nine and chipped in with a couple
of home" runs, one of them a
grand-slam.

Dunlap also homered, and Jaxel
and Walton had four hits each.

The Panthers continue their
busy schedule tomorrow against
Geneva at Mellon. Coach Lewis
has selected John Mirabelli, 0-1,
to face the Covies in a game that
was originally set for April 23.

Clarion follows ,on Friday with
Bill Hamilton, 1-1, ready to face
them. The last game for the Pan-
thers in this nine day stretch
comes Saturday at West Field in
Munhall as Bucknell pays the
locals a ‘visit. Either Moog or
Lindstrom will start against the
Bisons. /
