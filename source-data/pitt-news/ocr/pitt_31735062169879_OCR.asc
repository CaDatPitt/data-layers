PosVarAttempts To lify Issues

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

With turmoil and disruptions
erupting on college campuses
around the country. Chancellor
Wesley Posvar called a special
press conference Friday in an ef-
fort to clarify recent incidents at

, the University.

In a prepared statement. Dr.
Posvar attempted “to reduce mis-
understanding" between Pitt and
the public. revolving around fou
specific cases: ~

—The black student sit-in at the
Computer Center in mid-January.

——Legislature bills designed to
curb student demonstrations.

—The discredidation of ROTC.

—And the question of censor-
ship. involving the student publi-
cation. Alternatives.

At the same time, the Chancel-

Teaclvln Spealcers  

lor in answer to a question about _

the University’s state-relatedness
said, “State appropriations are in
jeopardy for a host of reasons.”
He blamed the tax base in Pitts-
burgh, party politics, and the eco-
nomics of balancing the budget
and cost cutting.

In short. Dr. Posvar tagged it
“a political morass."

Recently. a number of bills de— .

signed to curb student disruptions

. have been introduced in the state

legislature. Dr. Posvar disagrees
with these bills, calling such
measures “unnecessary.”

While in disagreement with
such bills, Dr. Posvar regretted,
that his expression of opposition
was interpreted as “a personal at-
tack” leveled at Sen. Robert Flem-
ing, who first proposed the “stu-
dent rules” legislation. ’

Dr. Posvar cited Sen‘. Fleming

Analyze Racism  

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer
Institutional racism‘ is the most
insidious and difficult ‘form of
white racism to fight was the cry
reiterated by the three speakers
who addressed an overflowing
crowd in the Public Health Audi-

. torium Friday afternoon.

The crowd had gathered to ‘par-
ticipate in a Teach In on White
Racism on the anniversary of the
assassination of Malcolm X. It
coordinated b_y the Process ‘69
Committee Against White Ra-
cism.

Richard Ridenour. VISTA co-
ordinator of the Pittsburgh Com-

munity Actionygroup. spoke on.

Racism and the Poor. Ridenour at-
tacked “white liberalism" as the
worst form of racism. because “it
causes the real damage and suf-
fering since the attitudes are in-
grained in institutions."

This is reflected in the preva-

lent mood, among white liberals.

that black progress has been
steady and upward. “This is a ra-
cist attitude,” said the speaker.

“There is no comparison -with
white progress. In reality the sit-'
uation for theblacks is worse to-
day than it was ten years ago.”

Ridenour gave severa1_examples

to support his assertion. He spoke
of unfair practices in employment.

housing and rents. income. health .

programs and education. "It’s ra-
cist to sa_y ‘take it slow.’ a piece
at a tim'e.f' insisted Ridenour.
“Everybodys pointing to the suc-
cess of urban renewal. ‘urban re-
moval’ is a better slip of the ton-
gue." -

“Ever_ybody‘s talking. too. about

law and order: nobody‘s talking
about justice.“ he said.

“The poor are being cranked
out of the'system,’? Ridenour con-
cluded. ""And the worst,kind of
racism’ is in nice folks‘ like, you;

you‘ who-.are‘ taki_ngj._part in the .

conspiracy of silence which is

t contributing to the destruction of

the poor in this country and which
contributed to the destruction of
six million Jews in Germany.’..,’

Dr. Theodore Windt, assistant
professor of speech. told of his
failure to get anything done at
the University of Texas at El Paso
using “moderate politics." “I tried

as "a respected and experienced
legislator and . . . a major con-
tributor to the support of the Uni-
versity."

On the faculty's vote for dis-
credidation of ROTC. Dr. Posvar
pointed out that “this decision
does not disestablish the ROTC
in Arts and Sciences.

“It makes ROTC a non-credit
activity,” Dr. Posvar said, noting
that some other universities have
already removed credit.

Obscene

“I personally support the con-

.-tinued presence of ROTC on cam-

pus. Igbeleve it is an important
elective element in a publicl_y-
supported institution." he added.

Commenting on the demands of
black students. who staged.a sit-
in at the Computer Center Jan.
15. ‘Dr. Posvar explained that.“the
University did not agree to any
demands‘ to which it wasnot al-

‘ready committed or that they were
considered unreasonable.“

"I do not condone the students
actions-in this case. “But those

who say weshould haveiimmedi- _

ately called the police do not. in
my opinion. understand the facts
of this incident." said the Chan-
cellor.

In the future. however. Dr. Pos-

‘var said. “We are prepared to
take whatever steps are necessary

to make certain that an orderly.

“academic environment’ is main-
tained." ’  "

that the phrases used were exam-

“This remains a matter of judg-

Scott Baum. SG president. has

 Senate for tonight at 7:30 p.m.
; We interviewed Ba-umsregard-.

‘Pitt News: Why have you call-

Baum: “I have called this

Baum: “So far the Chancellor

ness of the student body to sup-

Pitt News: Do you believe that
passing this bill is the only ac-
tion that students should take at
this time?

Baum: "I believe that any vio-
lent or even non-violent student
demonstrations against the Flem-

tate its passage. Students should
endeavour to persuade their par-

'ents to write letters. asvoters. to

‘as__truly revealed that the freedom and Ob]eClLlVlty of the press lS sheer myth. First. there is the
be following points will clarify this thesis.

I 7—THE MASS-MEDIA IN PITTSBURGH IS BIASED.

_.  The best example of blatant media bias in Pittsburgh, of course, is the
ittsburgh Press. And when the_Press is dealing with students. it waves the
oily red-flag. In January, when Black students staged a sit-in at the Univer-
ity’s'.Computer Center the Press dubbed them, “Black Rebels.” The Press
eadline describing Sen. Fleming's infamous bill read: “Student Rebel Crack-
own Bill in the Works.” Headlines in the Press reveal that the “light given
o the people” is. at best. filtered.

" »Media bias. moreover. is exposed by the little quips of television broad-
asters. WIIC’s Ron Jay recently said: “Going to college used to be fun: now
t_"s)."a riot.” The same station’s news director. Dave Kelly, has declared war
‘igainst all those students who don’t fit into his neat little ideological frame-
york. Have ,Mr. Jay or Mr. Kelly ever had long discussions with students about
heacademic community? Or do they sit back in their pious chairs and say “we
ite men of the world; we know what is right and what is wrong. These students
ij_e'too inexperienced to analyze contemporary events.”

 

 MASS-MEDIA IN PITTSBURGH IS INACCURATE.

,_ A great deal of the information printed in Pittsburgh news columns is
iironeous. When the Pittsburgh Press covered the mass student meeting in the
jornmons Room at the Cathedral. the reporter left the scene before Chancel-
or°Posvar made his appearance. The result was an incomplete story. The fol-
owing" Monday both Pittsburgh newspapers misquoted Or. Posvar andindi-.
atedthat he --was personally attacking the integrity of Sen. Fleming. And
,_e.lly’s Column quoted words from a Pitt News column as if it were represen-
ative of the newspaper’s viewpoint.

—fiTHE_MASS-MEDIA IN PITTSBURGH PRESENTS THE PUBLIC
 WITH UNBALANCED NEWS REPORTS.

if».

_ g , Every Sunday—the day of largest circulati_on—the Pittsburgh Press hits the
redulous public with another smashing Harrisburg dispatch describing the
tate gLegislature’s noble attempt to eliminate “radicalism” and violent dem-
onstrations. There has not been one article. to our knowledge, printed in either
Pittsburgh’s large circulation newspapers concerning student reaction to the
ecent Harrisburg legislation. .
 “Beyond this. television and radio air-time has been barraged with Harris-
urg verbiage. The stations, however, designed to give Chancellor Wesley Pos-
 ar some air time to state his case on the emotional issues plaguing the Univer-
sity. A

 ‘ But what about student and faculty sentiment. Throughout this dilemma.
ithis_newspaper has attempted to get its message out to the community. Our ef-
;_fQl‘lS have been frustrating. The only cooperative news agency in town has been
[the Associated Press. The rest of the media outlets were simplynot interested
_-‘in’ what some “irresponsible” student journalists had to say. When The Pitt
.!!News sent out editorials concerning ROTC. Student Power, and the Harris-
.;b‘urg legislation. there were. forthe most part. ignored. And when the media
ljrnanaged to mention our name, it was only in the derrogatory sense of being a
_ rebel newspaper.” The media, it seems. would rather pay attention to state-
‘merits like “that majority of halfwits, the Pennsylvania State Legislature. than
:_ examine the clearly defined arguments in our editorial space.

"THE MASS-MEDIA IN PITTSBURGH IS NOT
1 IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST." - I

_ . All residents in Pittsburgh are perpetuallyreminded of how all the news-
:-papers, radio and television station’s operate in the public interest. What is
their public interest. Well. K-DKA’s interest is Westinghouse first. and com-
 munity second. It would be inconceivable for KDKA to cover a story whose air-
. jng would be detrimental to the interests of Westinghouse. Likewise. the views
of WIIC—its columns and editorials—reflect the inarticulable influence of the
 Cox Broadcasting Co.

 
   
 
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
  
    
   
 
   
 

  
   
  
 
   
   
 
  
   
   
  
  
  
  

   
 

Our Father Fleming

who art in Harrisburg ‘
Respected by thy name

Thy constituency come

Thine will be done

On campus as it is in suburbia

Give us this day our daily rules

And forgive us our ideals

As we have forgiven those with other ideals
And lead us not into thought

But deliber us from anarchy

   
  
   
 
 

. All television and radio newsmen are confronted with the “must go" sit-
V uation. “Must go” means that the station’s management tells the news director

ii-vzbvout a story that must be aired becuase it is in the interest of the station's
 ners. . -

g Likewise. the Pittsburgh Press represents the influence of Scripps-How-
:..ard‘Newspaper. Inc. The Press doesn’t give filtered light to the people: it gives
t_to Scr1pps—Howard.

   
 
   
  
 

. _ - Above all. media news presentation is very congnizant of how the news
;-will affect advertisers. A newspaper. radio or television station will not usually

Reader Calls For Suppression

Edior. The Pitt News:

The recent demands brought to
Chancellor Posvar by a group of
“concerned“ students has brought
to the eyes of many at Pitt that
the students are getting away
with too much. The situation with
the Black students on campus has
gone much too far. The Negro is
getting away with so much at Pitt
that it is disgusting. but all the
administration has to say is “yes.
sir!" Perhaps someone with the
power should start slapping down
some of these trouble—makers and
begin to realize that they will
never be satisfied.

The recent release of Alterna-
tives was purely a gross show of

- how bold these radical students

want to be. Freedom of speech
does not include slanderor de-’
gradation of character. And these
students peak about rights. I am
sure no professor would stand for
language of this type in the class-
room. they why should it be tol-
erated in the University. It's time
that people stopped stretching
“rights” so far and put some more
emphasis on a few wrongs which
are. obviously and frequently be-
ing committed. Language such as
that used in issue four of Alterna-
tives merely shows that the writ-
er’ is too immature and rhetorical-
ly weak to express his opinions
clearly. Behavior of this type
should not be tolerated, and it is ’
time someone in the chancellor's
office took a look at whom they
are catering to.

Secondly: with very little ex-
amination of the field. one would
find that Senator Fleming's stand
against violence on campus is not
only justified but necessitated.
Fleming carefully emphasized
that peaceful demonstrations and
speech will not be infringed upon.
but that only riotous and violent
interferences will be acted

against. Why shouldn‘t the Uni-
versity comply with this legisla-
tion action? As soon as the police
department and fire department
are called upon in these situa-
tionsgthese problems become not
only university affairs but civil
problems as well. and should be
dealt with accordingly. Or is it
that some of these concerned stu-
dents are afraid that they will be
thrown out of school when they
do cause trouble. Face it. if you
keep in line you won't wind up in
trouble. This bill might be just

Now that we have your attention '. . .

Lastly. the appearance of so-
called FBI spies on campus was
not only denied by Chancellor
Posvar but also by the FBI itself.
Furthermore. even if there had
been agents on the campus. they
would only be placed there to ob-
tain information concerning. il-
legal matters. Is it that these com-
plainers are ultra-thin-skinned
and are insulted by. their being
watched: or is it that they have
something to hide? If there were
not so many pot pushers and vio-
lators of federal narcotics laws.
then there would be no need to
have someone checking on inci-
dents at Pitt.

I think it is time the students
realize that they do not own the
University but merely rent its
services, and that’ in_ university
and civil organizations. there is a
need for 7l~a'w and law
enforcement. Since Pitt ‘is sup-
ported largely by the State. the
State should have some say as to
the behavior of the students and
the operation of the college.

Nose Runs

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have encountered a serious
problem which concerns a consi-
derable portion of the University
community. Yesterday. I went to
the napkin dispenser in the Tuck
Shop in urgent need of napkins
to blow my running nose and to

- clean some spilled coffee. As us-

ual. the napkins were placed in
the dispenser backwards — there
was no fold to grasp quickly and
efficiently. In my desperation. I

tic making it ideal

grabbed at the flat surface pre-
sented and succeeded in tearing '
out 15 napkins~13 more than I
‘needed. It doesn’t take a whole
lot of intelligence to load a nap-
kin dispenser correctly. In order
to save a lot of needless waste and
aggravation. how about doing an
easy job the easy way—the right
way?

cation is recipient participation
in the training of DPA (Depart-
ment of Public Assistance) staff
members. Since they live in a
different environment, almost in
a different culture, it is difficult
for the DPA member to under-
stand the pressures to which the
recipient is subject.

With this participation, it will
be much easier for the DPA mem-
ber to fathom the stark reality of
no food and no money’ which the
recipient often faces at the end of
the month. This added contact
will familiarize the_re_cipient with

administrative problems. enabling,

him to work with the administra-
tion for maximum benefits.

Another aspect of communica-
tion is representation. The reci-
pient's viewpoint should be heard
at any meeting where his inter-
ests are being discussed. To be ef-
fective, any results of these meet-
ings should be communicated to
all branches of the administration
and welfare rights workers. and
be made easily available to all
recipients.

Communication cannot be es-
tablished without the proper fac-
ilities and aid from the Depart-
ment of Public Assistance. Reci-

1;...   Recipient’s Want Participation

pients can only seek assistance
from WROAC if it has some es-
tablished place of contact. For ex-
ample, WROAC is asking for desk
stations in each DPA district

where the recipient can find help .

and additional informationmabout
his rights. They are also asking to
be present at the interview if the
recipient so requests.

The sole purpose of theWROAC T

member is to provide a more com-
plete representation of the reci-
pient’s viewpoint. not to interfere
with the staff member or take the
initiative in the interview. Ac-
cording to the _current view. the

WROAC member is seen as an in- "

trusion. a disruption of the two of-
ten paternalistic relationship be-
tween thecase worker and client.
This attitude is one of the main

obstacles to the working relation- .

ship that WROAC wants to. in-
deed feels it has the right to de-
velop.

If there is one word that sum-
marized Dr. David Brown of the
math department. that word has
to be “concerned."

As Brown lectures to his Math
24 class. one gets the impression
he is lecturing because he wants
his class to learn math. He consi-
ders math. not as an instrument of

tortue. but as something which

might help his class as engineers.
teachers and scientists.

Dr. Brown is’ the kind of guy
who would take time out of his
recitation class to go over a prin-
ciple you were using in physics.
but hadn‘t covered in math yet.

1% Q,

You see Brown every Tuesda_y
and Thursday as a lecturer but
you never know what he is think-
ing about campus issues as a per-
son. So The Pitt News asked him!

What do you think of the lan-

guage requirement?

"Ridiculous. The language re-
quirement should be abolished al-
together—there are other ways to
teach a student about foreign‘cul—
ture.

V w\‘3~°“  

"Part of the reason the lan-
guage requirement fails is be-
cause there is no motivation for a
student to learn a language. Most
math majors think. ‘Why should I
have to learn French or German
or Italian?’ Ifthese students'.de-
cide to go to grad school in their
-junior or senior year and then take
a language. there is motivation.”

Would you be in favor of chang- '

ing to a pass-fail system?

obscene

“Yes, I‘m in favor of pass-fail

for everything for at least the first

two years. It’s not that I mind
giving a D.” Brown smilingly
said. “but in a lot of cases. this
means thatthe student’s scholar-

‘shipgoesﬁ , . _

“Failures in college are most
often psychological because of

pressures. Grading is therefore.

not ‘at measure of intelligence but
middle-class determination."

 

Pass—F ail System

What do you think about chang-
ing Math 22, 23, 24 to two types
of courses so math majors would
be familiar with more than cal-
culus before they had to declare
a major, and while other students
could have a foundation course
for physics and engineering?

t",No. this is a disadvantage of
math.

"There is a system of conflict-
ing philosophies between the
mathematicians and. say. physic-
ists. The physicists wants his stu-
dents to have an idea of the for-
mulas to use in solving a prob-
lem. The mathematician wants
his students to have idea of how
formulas work.

“Perhaps. there could be some
way to let two or three minors in
a field be equivalent to a major
in liberal artsi"

Do you think the course evalua-
‘tion is being taken seriously by
the faculty?

“Yes. the course evaluations are
being taken kind of seriously by
the faculty. They are not an an-
swer to everything, although they
are a start."

DR. DAVID BROWN

Do you have any comments to
make about the popularity of the
student power movement?

"In general. the faculty is wor-
ried about the rising currents of
student power.

"People have the idea now that
‘kids got to go to college — even
if they don’t know what they want
to do. College is equated with
success. which is ju-tified in terms
of hiring.

"People go through college not
knowing what the_v want. but
knowing they don’t want what
they‘re getting. This complaint
may be justifiable.”

The Hillman Library will open
at noon Sundays beginning March
2. according to Lynda Cahan.
chairman of the SG Library Serv-
ices Committee. However. the
change in time will only remain
if students take advantage of it.

As a result of a student ques-
tionnaire. a meeting with the Fac-
ulty Senate approved a list of
changes in library policy:

—Smoking will be permitted in
the nine group conversation rooms
on the second floor and the two
group conversation rooms on the
third floor.

—Individual study Carrels will
be placed along the north wall of
smoking rooms.

—Pieces of carpeting or rubber
mats are to be placed under the
four copying machines which are
now on uncarpeted floors.

—Subscriptions are to be placed
for the following newspapers for
use in the Undergraduate Library:
New York Times (Sunday and
daily), Pittsburgh Post-Gazette",
Pittsburgh Press, Wall Street Jour-
‘nal, Christian Science Monitor,
San Francisco Chronicle, and St.
Louis Dispatch.

—More. frequent checking of

. copying machines, particularly on

weekends, will be requested._ g

——A form to reserve carrels for
use" by seniors writingthesis is be-
ing designed by Information Serv-
ices.

—Request will be made for in-
stallation of a campus phone in
the bank of public phones on the
ground floor.

——Ground and first floor on the
south side of the library will be
designated at conversation rooms.

(Continued from Page 1)
to do something according to the
rules to help the black athletes at
the University of Texas. But I
didn‘t get anywhere. Nothing is
changed there," Dr. Wendt claim-
ed. ’

The speaker described the road-
blocks he encountered when ‘he
tried to get action on a series of
demands advanced by the black
athletes at the Southern school.
The charges filed by the blacks
were not radical, asserted Wendt.
The athletes wanted to date whom
they chose without fear of losing
their scholarships, to choose their
own living companions and for
their coaches to stop calling them
“niggers."

According to the speaker, a
coalition of Afro-American stu-
dents and the black athletes at the
Texas_school met only stalling
and hesitation from administra-
tors, faculty members, students,
and the news media. “we exhaust-
ed every resourc'e,” said Dr.
Wendt. “We had none left to play
politics with.”

When the black athletes refus-
ed to “perform“ last year out of
respect for the recent assassina-
tion of Martin Luther King. they
lost their scholarships and were
forced-to withdraw from the Uni-
versity. All attemps at “moder-
ate politics” failed.

The problems posed by institu-
tionalized racism in Texas left Dr.
Wendt "very pessimistic.“ “My
moderate politics failed. Every-
one kept saying thatthis ‘all takes
time; the blacks must wait.’ But
there must be change right away.
change dealing with important
things. deep feelings like hatred
and fear, " concluded the speaker.

“It will take white people to
rearrange their thinking. They
must le'am to see others as peo-
ple, not as categories. We can sit
here and work out our own guilt
but the time has come for action,”
said Wendt.

John Seideman, teaching assis-
tant from the History Depart-
ment. discussed The View from
Inside. He talked about the per-
manent occupation forces in the
ghettoes He. along with the other
speakers. attacked white liberals
as the most dangerous racists.

“The liberals (they are the peo-

ple who talk about values) believe
that the pentagon tactics are the

These same white liberals are
the ones that Stokely Carmichael
is asking to leave the civil rights
movement and work in their own
communities, according to the
speaker.

“There is a s-—t storm coming,"
said Seideman. quoting a contem-
porary black writer. “‘The blacks

role."’

“This s--- is racism.” Seideman
added. “But it's even more com-

Barely. 1969 is chuggin’ along.
As can be expected the political
scene is quiet with our friend Mr.
Nixon (I still have a certain hesi-
tancy about using the prefix Pres-
ident) assiduously keeping his un-
derarms dry and his hands will
manicured. A brief respite from
national concern is much welcom-
ed, and as long as Mr. Nixon con-
tinues to step lightly one doesn‘t
have to worry about what he may
tread upon.

The musical scene. too, is with-
out much of its usual fervor and
‘excitement. The Airplane did a
great live album, Jethro Tull has

- —s taken over where Jeremy and the

Satyrs left off and Bloomfield
Kooper managed to get together
a really tight jam session. but

__ nothing new or exceptionally note-

worthy has appeared to expel the
boredom and lighten the despair.
The Byrds are still together (or
at least their name is still being
used) and they have managed to
get out of their slavish imitation
of country and western which
ruined their Sweet Heart of the
Rodeo album. Their latest album.
Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde (CS
9755), still has country tenden-
cies but the music is more imagin-
ative and less parasitic.

The album grows on you after
a while especially songs like
f‘King Apathy III” and “Bad
Night at the Whiskey.” It’s the

' first time I’ve heard the Byrds get
‘_ into “head” nusic. They do a fair-
" ly good job, but McGuinn’s style

is still best suited to the folk and
country influence. “Wheels on

'. Fire” and “Child of the Universe”
’ are the best cuts, being the songs

in which the Byrds most imagina-
tively work the “Nashville Sound.”
The album was produced by Rob-

‘ ert Johnston who is probably the

most competent of Columbia's

I producers especially in the Nash-

ville line.

-noy and taunt the adminis-

there isn’t any group on the cur-
rent rock music scene which un-
derstands harmony and counter-
point as throughly as do the Bee
Gees. Their songs have always
a powerful haunting choral ar-
rangement to back them up. Odes-
sa is the most important album the
group has produced with its often

I elaborate orchestral arrangements

and its dirge-like vocals. Rock is
indebted to the Bee Gees (and the
Mamas and Papas) for showing
the full capabilities of the vocal
as an instrument in itself.

 NixonismHits HipMusic

From the liner notes of their al
bum. Moby Grape ‘69 (Cs 9695».
it seems that the Grape are trying
to get back into their music after
letting all the hype they origin-
ally got go to their heads. Sadly
enough Moby Grape ‘69 does not
measure up to the energy and
sheer force which their first al-
bum contained and which was so
lacking on their second. "Truck—
ing Man" is the only song which
comes close to capturing their
original vitality. It seems like all
the life has been sapped from the
Grape; even the. vocals aren’t like

§’
QVAQ‘

they used to be. “Ain’t That a
Shame” has a great country flav-
or to it and “Going Nowhere” a
strong choral arrangement. but on
the whole it just isn’t the same old
Moby Grape of the “Omaha“
days.

 Two Freshman Teams Secure Clutch Wins, But
Varsity Clubs Miss Chance For Upset Victories I 

Cagers Fail In Home Final
As Big Bill Dominates Play

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

The basketball team attempted to avenge an old Penn State
jinx Saturday night at the Field House, but instead, dropped
the eleventh straight contest with their Pennsylvania rivals. 57-49.

"The game was too fast." said coach Buzz Ridl after the last home

Every time the cagers gained momentum. however. poor shooting
jinxed the cause.

, Once again, Stansfield caused
more trouble than the cager men
could handle. With 6:04 still re-
-maining in the first half, center
Jerry Causer committed his
fourth foul of the night. Mike
Patcher was then called to guard
the Florida native, but had little
success.

“During one stretch,” said
Ridl, “we missed seven straight
shots. We could have won with a
little better shooting.”

Cager” shooting was miser-
able. to say the least." The men of
Ridl connected on only 18 of 58
shots. a 31% performance. The
cagers also missed from the
charity line, converting on just
13 of 21 tosses.

But the biggest cager problem
was not shooting; it was Penn
State pivot Bill Stansfield. Stans-
field. who was the prime contrib-
uter in the Lions’, 65-50, ‘victory

 earlier this season did it again.

The big man grabbed 14 re-
bounds, poured in 23 points, and
succeeded in dominating the con-
test. For the senior center, the

' win was the eighth straight with-
out a loss against cager fives.

"He played a lot better than last
time.” said Ridl. “In the first

"He was just too much man-
power.” said Ridl.

When Stansfield wasn’t grab-
bing rebounds. Bill Young was.
Young also pulled down 14 re-
bounds and combined with Stans-
field in dominating both boards.

The Lions outrebounded the
weaker hoopsters, 54-38. The only
cager able to hold his own under
the boards was sophomore Mike
Riggle.

Riggle played against Young
evenly when he got into the action.

Cubs Belt Johnstown Club,
Grgurich Rejects ‘100’ Bid

        

 
  

by ED CONLEY

Just about everybody in the Field House Saturday night
wanted the Cubs to score 100 points against the Johnstown Cam-
pus team; everyone except frosh coach Tim Grgurich, that is.

The cubs won the game. easily. 99-64. but could have reached the
century mark with little trouble. Ed Paluzzi scored the 98th point
with 35 seconds leftin the game. causing the expected “We want
100" chant from the crowd.

That’s when Grgurich gave the
orders to stay under that tally.
An order that caused guard Dave
Vaughn some embarrassment. The
guard was trying to follow the
command by dribbling the clock
out. But. Johns'town‘s Paul Por-
ada would have ‘none of that. He
fouled Vaughn twice.

The duo connected for 25
of the Cubs’ points in the open-
ing ten minutes of the stanza. us-
ually scoring from underneath
or on fouls that resulted from
drives.

O’Gorik left the game with
6:56 remaining. having scored 25
points. Lewis departed a minute
later after racking up 21.

Grgurich lifted O’Gorek early
in the game, too. He wasn’t
satisfied with the center’s play
and decided a conversation was
needed. '

The Cub managed to miss his ‘
Qfirst two tries, but his third

chance went through the nets.
When his final attempt banged
hard against the boards most of
the fans realized what the Cubs
were doing.

“It wasn’t for show or any-
thing.” Grgurich said. “The shoe
might be on the other foot some
day. We might need 118 or 119
points to win a game. "

Even if the Cubs would have
scored that 100th point. the game
wasn’t always the breather the
score indicates. The frosh held
a slim 36-28 halftime lead.

They were fired up when they
_ came out of the locker room the
Q’ second time, though Especially
the game’s leading scorers, Paul
« ‘ O’Gorek and Steve Lewis.

"We take our boys out when
they‘re doing something wrong
and we tell them what it is."
Grgurich noted. “I just told, him
to be a bit more agressive on
the boards.” 1

“Bob Cizmarik and (Rodi
Schoon didn’t score much. but
they did a heck of a job rebound-
ing. on defense and passing.” he
mentioned. “They were great."

“They (Johnstown)
about the same,” Grgurich de-
cided. “But, we must have play-
ed a little differently. I guess
so, look at the score.” / 7

Tracksters’ Worst Weekend ,

Results from Tough Breaks

by ED CONLEY

Nothing seemed to be able to
stop Jim Banner’s thinclads in
the first five weeks of this win-
ter‘s indoor season. This week-
end, however, a string of bad
luck proved too much for the
track men as they suffered
through their worst days of
the campaign.

The problems started Friday
night in New York City where
Jerry Richey was hopeful of a
big victory over some of the best
1500-meter runners in the world.
A leg injury hampered Richey‘s

"He was limping badly." Ban-

Richey has done better than that

State Dominates Meet

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

To be beaten by the best is no disgrace. Thus. without dis-
grace the gymnasts returned to the University Saturday from
University Park after a 161.65-104.21 defeat at the hands of the

Penn State gymnasts.

Before a four thousand-plus audience the gymnasts went up
against the number-one gymnastics team in the East. A combination
of many variables produced the final score. One important variable

was the crowd itself.

“We were scared." related
gymnast Lowell Meek. “There was
no doubt about that the size of the
crowd made many of us, includ-
ing me, a bit anxious about our
performances.“ A bit more
anxious than the varsity might
have been the four freshmen
scores counted into the final tally
of the meet; the first time that‘s
been done this season.

Among the higher scoring fresh-

long horse vault. Phil Lilly drop-
ped out of the vault competition
due to an injury incurred during
the meet.

Penn State, though. exhibited a
team which functioned quite op-
posite of the gymnasts. They took
first. second and third in every
event with almost every perform-
er scoring in the high eights or
very close. Senior Bob Emery per-
formed in only four instead of his
usual six events and scored a 9.0.

 
   
     
 

kept him out of the meet and an-
other sprain slowed down the
squad’s two relay teams.

Smitty Brown had the ankle

sprain that hurt the relay quart-

et. Still, the mile group grabbed
second place. finishing with a
3223.3 time. Cincinatti won that
chase with a 3:23 time.

“Smitty didn't run well at all."
Banner said. “He wasn’t running
like himself. They had high turns
there. and with his ankle. . . it
wasn‘t his fault.” the coach con-
unued.

The breaks didn’t stop falling
the wrong way, either. Bryant
Salter couldn’t clear the start-
ing high jump height of 6’6” and
had to leave Cleveland without
placing in the event.

“I guess the mile relay was
the only thing that turned out
well,” Banner reasoned.

Despite all of that misfortune.
things could have been worse.
Banner had intended on taking a
few more runners to the meet
(Dave Garnett and Elliot Drys-
dale, in particular), but decided
differently at the last minute.

“I was going to take them, but
I changed my mind and didn’t
take a lot of them,” he stated.
“I thought I would let them rest
after last week.

“We’ll all go to Delaware next
week,” he added. “The fresh-
man mile relay team will run.
too.”

He meant the Delaware Invi-
tational which was supposed to
have been on the schedule this
weekend. The thinclads found
some good luck in this delay.

“It is pretty hard to determine exactly
what has been accomplished because of all
that has happened this month,” he stated
calmly, as he puffed on an ever-present ci-
gar. “Every area is a major issue and right
now, I’m trying just to keep everything mov-

When DePasqua first began his new
position, he laid out for himself a list of
priorities that he wanted to start on im-
diately. This list contained three major
areas where most of the initial energy was
to be centered. They were an assembling of a good and com— —
petent staff, recruiting for next year’s freshmen.squad, and
the organization of spring practice.

DePasqua plans to have a staff of seven assistants plus
himself. “As head coach, I tried to bring in my own people,”
he explained. “I tried to take care of people who have given
service to their alma mater. Of course, they had to be extrem-
ly competent people.

“I wanted people who had the background and combat
experience for the league we play,” continuted DePasqua.
“I wanted the type that our players can respect and also
learn football from. The people I have now are the utmost

ing spring practice. “Spring practice is an area where we will
analyze the skills of each boy,” he explained. “We are only
allowed 20 practice sessions, and we will probably not have
any team meetings as they count as practice sessions.”

DePasqua feels that even though part of spring practice
will be held during finals, it should have no effect on the
boy’s performance both in the classroom and on the field.

“I feel that an athlete should be able to handle both jobs,”

as they do on the student body.”

smoothly, Carl DePasqua now sets his sights on learning his

“A computer has no mind of its own. its
‘brainpower’ comes from the people who
create the programs,” says Rod Campany.

Rod earned a B.S. in Math in 1966. Today, ,
he’s an IBM Systems Programmer working on
a portion of Operating System/360, a
hierarchy of programs that allows a computer
to schedule and control most of its own
operations.

A mixture of science and art
“Programming” means writing the instruc-
tions that enable a computer to do its job.
Says Rod, ‘‘It’s a mixture of science and art.

You're a scientist in the sense that you have to

analyze problems in a completely logical way.

 

Programming at IBM

“|t’,s a chance
to use everything
you’ve goti’ =

“But you don’t necessarily hunt for an ulti-
mate right answer. There can be as many
solutions to a programming problem as
there are programmers. That's where the art
comes in. Any given program may work, but
how well it works depends entirely on the
ingenuity of the programmer.”

Programmers hold a key position in the
country’s fastest growing major industry-
information processing. Business Week re-
ports that the computer market is expanding
about 20 percent a year.

You don’t need a technical degree
If you can think logically and like to solve

problems, you could become an IBM pro-

grammer no matter what your major. We’ll
start you off with up to twenty-six weeks of
classroom and practical training.
