Counseling Services Set

Career Aid

The University of Pittsburgh has established a compre-
hensive counseling service dedicated to helping Pitt stu-
dents choose and educate themselves for the careers for

‘which they are best suited.

Founding of the center was announced by Dr. Charles
H. Peake, assistant chancellor for student affairs, who sum-

med up the philosophy underly-6

ing the new program and de-
scribed its operation.

“The University Counseling
Center is being established to
ﬁll a long felt need for career
and personal counselings,” he
said. “In the normal course "of
events, University students are
confronted with a series of de-
cisions, all crucial to the ulti-
mate choice of a career.

“To form a basis for making
such decisions, the Counseling
a series of conferences to arrive
at a realistic self-appraisal of his
Center will help the student in
interests, temperament and apti-
tudes.

“In addition, the Center will
have the Library of Career‘ and
Graduate Fellowship Informa-
tion. This library, among other
things, will offer full particulars
regarding graduate fellowships, as
well as descriptivematerial rela-
tive to speciﬁc occupational ﬁelds.
I “The University has a deep
concern for the growth and de-

velopment of each of her stu-

dents. The establishment of the

University Counseling Center

is a direct reflection of this

concern.” ‘

The Pitt Counseling Center will
utilize the best contemporary
counseling techniques, drawing
upon psychological testing and
other aids for educational and
vocational programming,‘ and
upon psychiatric aid in cases
where this kind of personal coun-
seling is necessary.

The program is aimed at
averting the tragedies of in-
dividuals who have chosen ed-
ucational programs for which
their potential abilities do not
ﬁt them, and of students who
have followed the urgings of
parents only to fail in ﬁelds in
which their motivation was not

strong enough to carry them to
success.

Dr. Peake said a series of con-
ferences with a staff of counsel-
ors which will be set up will as-
sist thevstudent in an effort to

’57 Homecoming Date Selected;
Chairmen To Be Named Soon a

The weekend of Nov. 1 has been set as homecoming for 1

1957. At the Student Congress meeting Monday, David

Bender, Col. ’57, also announced in his president’s report.

that the ﬂoat parade, held in

the Schenley Park Plaza this

semester, in all probability will-be back in the Stadium on
Nov. 2, the parade site in previous years.

The homecoming game will bee

with the Panthers’ Eastern foe,
Syracuse.

Whereas the chairmen for
Homecoming are usually choseu
later in the year, this year a new
method has been introduced. The
positions of overall chairman,
business manager, and publicity
chairman will be ﬁlled after the
interviews next Thursday, Jan-
uary 17. Applications are now
available in the Dean of Men’s
office, and the interviews will be
held at 2:30 p.m. in 832 C1 on the
aforementioned date.

By making the selections for
the chairmanships at this early
date, there will be more time for
the students and the athletic de-
partment to meet and plan a more
successful Homecoming.

The Homecoming chairmen are
not the only ones who will be
chosen early. Howard Rossen, Col.
’58, also stated that candidates for
Spring Festival heads will be
interviewed at the same time. The
three positions open at this date
are overall chairman, business
manager, and publicity chairman.

Completing the list of chairmen
to be picked are those to head the
staff of the Polaris. The inter-
views for editor, business man-
ager, and staff positions will be
held tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. in 83?.
C1.

At Monday’s meeting Student
Congress also defeated a motion
concerning student seating at foot-
ball games that had been passed
two months ago. As the original

motion stood, Congress would

have asked the athletic depart-
ment to relocate the student sec-
tion on the 50-yard line.
However, Lowell Tarbett, Eng.
’57, told the members that the

His motion was passed, and then
in turn the original motion was
defeated. Thus, next year as in
the past the student section will
range from the 35-yard line to
the goal.

On the subject of streetcar
passes for students atthe Univers-
ity, Don Kaiserman, Col. ’58, re-
ported that the Pittsburgh Rail-
ways Company does not issue
passes for students at a school
that charges tuition. But the
company did say that Congress
shouldsend a letter to the Board
of Trustees in regard to the idea.

Finally, it was announced that
Charles H. Peake, assistant chan-
cellor in charge of student affairs,
will speak to the student body on
future plans for the Student Union
on Thursday, Jan. 17, at 2:30 p.m.
in Stephen Foster Memorial Hall.

0 Women Student Group

 

Holds National Meeting

One hundred and eighty-ﬁve representatives from twen-
ty-one colleges and universities attended the International
Association of Women Students’ convention in which Pitt

participated last Saturday.

Workshop groups discussed dormitory problems, pur-
poses and ideals of women’s government associations, rela-

tions to other groups on campus;

and ﬁnancial support of women’s
government on campus. , '

Pitt IAWS representative Chris
Taylor, Col. ’58, said that the sug-

, ‘ « gestions obtained at the conven-

tion were “worthwhile -for future
consideration” when Pitt begins
use of women’s dormitories in the
Schenley Apartments.
Government of dormitory life,
of some of the‘ attending schools
was confused because of sep-
~ arate governments. Pitt is under
a central Housing Board.
Separation of dorm students and
commuters was prevalent among
many of the schools present. Syra-
cuse had separate meeting places

-on two different ﬂoors for those

who live on campus and for com-
muters. Pitt delegates described

fthe University activities’ integra-

tion of all women students.

Integration

The p r o b l e m of dispersing
knowledge of different organiza-
tions on campus was discussed at
the convention. Pitt representatives
explained a solution for this in
the Pitt WSGA. Commission meet-
ings here are open to attendance

‘ of all students and are represented

by every women’s organization. In
addition, a Pitt News staff repre-
sentative attends meetings and re-
ports directly to the university
newspaper. 1
General problems of money-
raising for various women’s gov-
ernments present does not exist
for this university as WSGA
obtains money from the Pitt

Meet in March

Final speaker of the convention
was a former president of the
women’s government at Ohio
State. This former student said
that many women ask for "too
many responsibilities. Students
should realize, she said, that they
have obligations to those not in
college yet, those who will be
living under rulings of and in the
atmosphere set by women in col-
lege now. 7

Representative Chris Taylor was
appointed to her position for a.
three-year period which began in

CARE Packets

Sent Overseas

ByPharmacists

By ED cnovsn

A belated word of praise
should go to Pitt’s School of
Pharmacy for having made
the Christmas season a little
brighter for’ several Hun-
garian families.

During the weeks before Christ-
mas vacation,-the School of Phar-
macy’s Beta Kappa chapter of
Kappa Psi, professional pharmacy
fraternity, sponsored a fund drive
among pharmacy students and
faculty ‘to buy CARE packages for
Hungarian relief. , .

Under committee chairman Dave
Coates, Phar. ’57, eight Kappa Psi
members solicited pharmacy school
for funds for that worthy cause.

Soliciting from their respec-
tive classes were seniors Dave
Coates and John Rosille; junior
Gerald Beck; sophomores Rob-
ert Swen, Richard. Stinson and
Roy Williams; and freshmen
Dale Stahl and Clarence Peters.

The collections netted $155.00
which has been sent to CARE
headquarters and designated for
Hungarian relief.

The money was sent to CARE
under the name of Pitt’s School
of Pharmacy, rather than under
the name of the sponsoring fra-
ternity. 1

Because of this fraternity effort, .

perhaps some family was not so
hungry nor so cold in that country
where peace on earth and good
will to men are little more than
words. ' P

Belziml Closed Doors

There has been a committee working behind closed
doors these past few months that may turn out to be one of
the most important student committees ever organized at
Pitt. Sponsored by Student Congress, the seven-member
committee has undertaken the task of evaluating Pitt’s
present system of student government. The project arose
through Congress’ foresight of a need for a more uniﬁed
government andbecause of the University’s new emphasis
on coeducational activities.

What we guess the committee is attempting to do is to
ﬁnd a “desired structure” for a new governing body either

.- by revamping the present Congress or merely building on
’ what already exists. Certainly there is seen the need for

improvement in the areas of responsibilities and representa-
tion. SC—as has happened many times this‘year—-—has found
itself hampered in carrying out particular duties because of
its responsibility to too many authorities. Its weakness in
representation is evident when it is observed that SC is not
representing every full-time undergraduate student while
its organization is guilty of duplicate representation.

Congress is faced with these and other problems that
must be overcome if we are to have effective government.
The evaluating committee may have the answers. Although
we cannot say for certain what the committee will propose
when it finishes its work, we can be sure, that after months
of research, its ﬁndings will be well thought—out and of ut-

Value. of Conventions‘ . . .
Th 0 uis i d e L
By Barbara Cheringfon‘

For better student government and happier stu-
dent life, student legislation, judiciary opinion and
evaluating committees are effective.
these activities become subjective, since the groups
have only themselves to judge by. There is no

outside group considered primarily.
Another, perhaps stronger, activity for learn-

ing of better student govern-
ment and facilities, is the visit
to another school or to a conven-
tion of schools, such as the cm-
vention of International Associa-
tion of Women ‘Students which
Pitt delegates attended last
week—end. ' ‘
Dormitory hours, dormitory
placement, and other rulings

‘were discussed by campus . ‘ '

women do not have the same dorm situation, the
delegates proﬁted by noting hints/for the future

The, Money Problem_. . .

Inadequate

By Millard Amdur

In‘ these days, when many col-
\ leges and universities desper-
ately require funds in order ‘to
institute higher salaries and bet-
ter facilities, one college most
people feel has
— no need of such
, funds for either
of these pur-
~ poses is Harv-
ard C 0 11 e g e.
This is surpris-
ingly enough,
completely un-
true.
The Harvard
G o v e r n in g
Boards have.
app oi nt e d a
committee of over 30 alumni to
implement a n unprecedented
three-year fund raising program.
As Harvard’s youthful president,
Nathan M. Pusey, related in a
letter sent to “Alumni and
Friends of Harvard,” this en-
deavor may well “contribute to
a strengthening of colleges and
universities throughout the na-
T tion.” Already, many universities
are following Harvard’s ex-
ample, but let’s discuss exactly
what Harvard is trying‘ to ac-
complish.
Presen-I Needs
One of the more pressing pre-
sent needs of Harvard, as Pusey
has outlined them, are higher
salaries for teachers commensu-
rate with excellence. Although
Harvard’s salaries are the high-
est in the profession, they be-

Tour Union

Harvard

lieve that they ‘are not high‘

enough and that the salaries at
Harvard have contributed sig-
niﬁcantly to the school’s “great-
ness.”

Another area of importance in
Harvard’s concept of education
is the educational environment.
Intellectual conditions should be
of high quality to stimulate
learning. Although their libra-
ries, laboratories and museums
are unexcelled at other schools,
they “cannot afford to rest con-
tent.” ‘

A complementary need in the

environment is for new Houses
(dormitories). Harvard’s Houses
are only about 25 years old, yet
they feel that the buildings are
inadequate and consequently
must be augmented and expand-
ed. They plan a minimum of two
more Houses as part of the
three-year plan. H a r v a r d ’ s
Houses are more than dormitor-
ies, but as their administrators
put it, “a device for preserving
in the midst of a large univers-
ity an intimate ‘collegiate way of
living’.” This is largely pattern-
ed after the ideal set at English
universities.

New faculty houses and grad-
uate apartment dwellings for the
married must be provided
through this fund-raising effort.
The collegiate way of life must
essentially contain “close asso-
ciation of teacher and student,
of younger and older.”

Bands Stayed Home

By Murray Chess

In recent years the Gator
Bowl committee has been trying
to push its post-season game on-
to as high a plateau as the big
four——the~ Rose, Cotton, Sugar,
and Orange. By

for this contest

   
     
 
 

and G e o r g i

oﬁicials too .
the most ' -
portant step’ in this direction.

The Panthers and Engineers,
led by quarterbacks Corny Sal-
vaterra and Wade Mitchell, per-
formed _as expected. They put on
a good, rough battle and kept
the stadium ﬁlled until the ﬁnal
gun. This game could have es-
tablished the Gator Bowl as ,a
major bowl, but the Jacksonville
officials failed to realize that the
color and pageantry of a bowl
contest also help make it what
itis.  ., ........

   

Thus, the University of Pitts-
burgh 120-piece varsity march-
ing band and its Georgia Tech
contemporary were left in Pitts-
burgh and Atlanta, respectively,
to see the game on television and
to see what should have been
their time taken up by a bunch
of high school kids.

And that is exactly where the
Gator committee missed the
boat. Possibly the only people
who enjoyed the halftime show
were the parents of the children.
Surely Pitt fans did not, nor did
many other lookers-on. At a
given ‘ signal a group of boy
scouts raced onto the ﬁeld and
stretched out strips of red and
chartreuse cloth ‘that reached
across the ﬁeld.

Exercises Held

As the scouts sat down on the '

strips to anchor them to the
ground, a horde of -Jacksonville
high school girls, dressed in
white blouses and shorts, enter-
ed the scene and commenced to
go through some form of exer-
cises. When they were ﬁnished
and went off the ﬁeld, a few
children who may not have yet
reached grade school age per-

formed (?). The ﬁnale had some

Another characteristic not liked by the Pitt
delegation was various women’s organizations not C '
knowing the activities of the women’s governing
body. This university erraces ignorance by includ-
ing representatives of the various women’s organi-
zations in WSGA commission.

Tours through other campuses is an insight to
one’s own improvement, too. At Ohio State, all
delegates toured the new student union building.
This, through the Pitt people present, will proﬁt
our own building of a student union.

To be occasionally on the outside looking into
student government and facilities is as effective
as legislation and evaluating committees.

partment, and their astronomy
department needs aid. New phy-
sical facilities for the Dept. of

‘Social Relations, a ﬁeld becom- _

ing most important to under-
grads, will be provided. New
classrooms and additional office
space for the faculty of Arts and
Sciences will be made available.
And, perhaps most signiﬁcantly,
the endowment of the Harvard
Library, already one of the ﬁnest
collections in the U.S., will be
increased.

Larger amounts of scholarship
aid, although $400,000 of unre-
stricted funds plus sizeable num-
bers of endowed scholarships are

«being awarded, is another de-

ﬁnite need of Harvard College.
And, ﬁnally, Harvard’s large

athletic budget, concentrating on“

a successful intramural, inter-
house program is inadequate“.
‘Some might ask at this point,
who cares? What does this have
to do with us at Pitt? Pitt, too,
is in the process of deepening
the’ quality of the institution.
Whereas Harvard administrators

areas afore mentioned,‘ Pitt’:

around the ﬁeld with a model

Gator Bowl.

When it was announced some-
time prior to the game that the
bands of the two schools would
not be needed, officials said that
CBS (televisers and broadcast-

ers of the game) had its own 

show planned. Maybe it was just
another one of CBS’ spectaculars
that flopped.

A couple of remarks were

overheard that just about sum‘

up the absurdity. One sideline
observer said, “It looked like
something taken from a Moscow
May Day.” Another came up
with this opinion: “CBS must
stand for Children’s -Benevolent
Society.”

By using a little more crea-
tiveness and imagination, the
Gator producers could have
come up with an enjoyable and
worth-watching show, with the

Then for sure ‘the Gator Bowl
could have taken its deserved

By JOHN STRAUCH

Round and round she goes,
and where she stops every-
body knows . . . everybody
that is, who works at the Pitt
cyclotron laboratory.

Unlike the wheels of for-

tune found at street fairs and
traveling carnivals, Pitt’s giant
cyclotron does not work on a hit
or miss basis. Every part of its
complicated operation is the re-
sult of careful planning and inten-
,._si\ve calculation by trained per-
rsehnel. '

The huge mechanism, a scien-
tiﬁc device used for experimental
research on the structure of the
atom, is located in an unimpres-
sive little yellow brick building on
O’Hara Street.

That same building also houses
the office of Dr. Alexander Al-
len, head of the cyclotron lab-
oratory and an instructor in ad-
vanced physics at the univer-
sity. So well-versed is Dr. Allen
in the ﬁeld of physics that dur-
ing World War II he spent ﬁve

“»..years working for the govern-
ment at the Massachusetts In-
' stitute of Technology. He re-

turned to Pitt, though, in 1946

to do experimental work with

the cyclotron.

The cyclotron, as the doctor
puts it, looks something like a
"big piece of round, hollow cheese”
and is surrounded by a conglom-
eration of dials, switches, wiring,
and other electrical equipment. It
is hqused not only in a lead-sur-
rounded room but also under the
earth’s surface, for that seemingly
unimpressive little building on
O’Hara Street extends far back
into an adjacent hillside.

_ Built After War

Built here at Pitt after the end
of World War II, the device weighs
almost 700 tons and costs about
$32 per hour to operate. The cost
of a similar “big piece of cheese”
today would be well over one
million dollars.

Describing the purpose and op-
eration of the cyclotron in simple,
everyday terms, Dr. Allen offers
this explanation: “The purpose of

INDICATING the port through which the accelerated sub-atomic '

particles are ﬁred at their foil target is Dr. Alexander Allen,

head of the Sarah Mellon Scaife /Cyclotron Laboratory.

Dr.

John Cameron looks on. The small cyclotron lab is located on *

0’Hara Street.
0’ O O ’
the cyclotron is to do basic re-
search on the internal structure of
the nucleus of the atom. ,_

“We do this by accelerating nu-
clear particles to a terriﬁc energy
level by causing them to whirl in-
side the cyclotron. These speeding
particles are then aimed and ﬁred
at the nucleus of theatom, caus-
ing parts of that nucleus to be
knocked away. By observing these
particles that ﬂy off we can get a
picture of just what goes on in-
side that nucleus.”

These effects are observed by
the traces they leave on photo-
graphic plates, in cloud chambers,
or in magnetic ﬁelds.

“It’s sort of like shooting a
bullet into a house and watching
the splinters fly out as it comes
through the other side,” says Dr.
Allen.

Important To Security

Such experimentation with the
atom is obviously of high impor-
tance to our national security.
Realizing this, the national gov-
ernment has joined the university
in ﬁnancing operations at the lab-

6 O O
oratory. '

Although the laboratory also has
facilities for carrying on research

in other branbhes of physics, the-

giant cyclotron is the pride and
joy of the 93 people who comprise
the working force there, and it is
kept humming no less than twelve
hours per day.

Most of the workers employed
by the laboratory are Pitt stu-
dents who work there on a part-
time basis in order to gain valu-
able first-hand experience in
scientiﬁc experimentation.

Commenting on the practice of
employing these students, Dr.
Allen says, “Our chief interest
here is teaching, and we believe
that this on-the-spot experience
is the best way to produce a
good undergraduate student.”

The students seem to enjoy it;
for many a night, long after the
Cathedral has been emptied, lights
still burn brightly in that little
yellow building on O’Hara Street.

And far back under the hill-
side, in a room lined with lead

Splendid Small Size ‘Sity’

By DAVID BREAKSTONE I

You never know what you may ﬁnd if you start thumb-
ing through books like the almanac, dictionary, or ’Who’s

Who.

Interesting bits of information may be gleamed even
from such a utilitarian work as the Pitt Student Directory.
One of these bits of chance falderal is that there’s a fellow

here at Pitt who hails from Snow1>

Shoe, Pennsylvania.

Being curious about such a pic-
turesque name at this time of
year, we tracked down this boy
who turned out to be one Abel
Soster, a freshman pre-dent stu-
dent.

The s l i g h t, question-shy
blonde pinpointed Snow Shoe,
his home,‘ as being in the Alle-
ghenies, perched high» on a
ridge, about thirty miles from
State College. ‘‘There’s not
really a town, strictly speak-
ing for sixty miles,” he report-
ed cheerfully. There are about
800 people in the community
where coal mining is the chief
source of income.

This rural town is far from the
city boy’s conception of the coun-
try. Electric lights, the corner
drug store, yellow convertibles,
and television with reception
“even better than you~ get here"
are customary in Snow Shoe, too.
After vainly seeking for ‘something
they didn’t have which we take
for granted, we ﬁnally hit on one
thing —— movies! “Nary a one in
town,” Abel admitted with an
amused grin. Apparentlyphe didn’t
miss ‘the flicks much. '

“There are more people here
in the city, but you get to know
fewer than back home,” be ob-
served when asked about his
initial reaction to our urban
melting pot. “I didn’t know
what to expect when I ﬁrst ar-
rived, but I found that people
were very friendly to me.” The
Cathedral was quite a change
from the two-story frame build-
ing in which Abel was schooled
for the ﬁrst twelve years. In
describing his old school, he al-
lowed that it looked “something
like a barn; only bigger, of
course.”

Quite naturally Mr. Soster is
a real outdoorsman. He thrives on

Chess Club Wins

Progress Award

Recently the University of
Pittsburgh Chess Club‘ received a
citation from the Pennsylvania
State Chess Federation for the
University achieving the most
progress in Intercollegiate Chess
in the past year. The cooperation
of the University officials and Stu-
dent Congress was cited.

The publicity appearing in
the Pitt News in regard to the
Club activities was called to the
attention of the other Univers-
ities and was a signiﬁcant
factor in the winning of the
award. The Club has had a not-
iceable increase in membership
this year and has participated
in many away matches.

In the United States Intercol-
legiate Team Chess .Champion-
ships held in Philadelphia, Penn-
sylvania December, 26 to 30 the
Chess Club sent four team’play-
ers; Luther Henry, George Svara-
nowic, Virgil Rizzo, and Tim Kent.

WVU Defeats Cagers, 89-86.

,M0unties Beat

F rash, 81-69

By MIKE GERBER

Led by Butch Goode and
Willy Akers, the West Vir-
ginia University freshmen
cagers handed Coach Carl
Peterson’s Panther Cubs their

5 second consecutive defeat of

the season last night at the Field
House. ‘ The ﬁnal score of the
colorful and action-ﬁlled contest
was 81-69.

The West Virginians displayed
poise and clever ball handling as
is rarely seen on freshman teams,
and it was to the Blue and Gold’s
credit that they managed to hang
on as they did and lose by only
twelve points. M V

The victory was the eleventh in
as many starts for the Ridgerun-

hers, and from the way they han-
'dled _themselves one would im-

agine they had been playing to-
gether for several seasons. It is

‘ inconceivable-that they could lose

any games at all.

Panthers Rally

Despite the high-class style of
the Mountaineers, the Panther
Cubs showed plenty of courage
and hustle in their effort to keep
up with the West Virginians.
Though trailing by as much as 14
points during the (ﬁrst half, they
‘pulled to within six points at
halftime when the score was 34-
28. In the second half, though, the
Mounties made use of their su-
perior reserve strength and pulled
away to their twelve point victory.

Virginia’s Sharrar (31) and Don
Vincent (15) for a spectacular

the losing cause were Tom Ma-
loney and Gene Massari. Ma-
loney played an alert, ball-
hawking game and was very
effective under the Mounties’
backboard. Maloney ‘scored 22
points for the Panthers, most of
which,came on drive-in layups.
Massari also played a terriﬁc

ball game in defeat as he set up
well and scored 17 points.

Also performing well for the
Blue and Gold were John Man-
dish and Bill Mauro. Mandish
dropped 16 points through the
hoop, sinking eight out of eight
free throws in the second half,
and Mauro, returning to action
after a bad automobile accident,

Swimmers Meet Ohio Teams,

After Losing to

State, 50-35 C

By MURRAY CHASS
The defending ECSA Panther swimming team will travel
to Ohio this wekend, stil.l looking for its initial victory of
the young season. After Monday night’s loss to North Caro-
lina State, 50-35, Coach Ben Grady’s mermen have an 0-2

A
7

record.

Although Grady says he does
not know what to expect on Fri-
day and Saturday, the’ Panthers
stand a better than even chance
to break into the winning column
at Athens against the Ohio Uni-
versity team in the ﬁrst of their
weekend series.

The Bobcats were an easy mark
for the local tankers in 1955, los-
ing by 32 points, 58-26. However,
the Panthers opening opponents,
Rutgers, proved that previous
scores mean nothing when they
nosed out Grady’s boys by a pair
of points. Last year the Panthers
had romped by '28.

OSU Saturday

This Saturday the Oaklanders
will face the only team that is
new on the 1957 schedule, Ohio
State. The Buckeyes will no doubt
give the Panthers a tougher ﬁght
than Ohio U., if only for the rea-
son that the meet is._on the second
day of the trip. After this pair
of meets, the swimmers will rest
from regular competition until

A ,.February 6. Grady is hoping that

by then his squad will “be in
shape.”
In the losing cause Monday
night, the natators met what
was undoubterly the most amaz-
ing team they will face all year.
Coach Willis Casey brought a
meager eight-man North Caro-
lina State squad to Pittsburgh
that had only split in its fou
previous meets. ” ‘
But among those eight were
enough outstanding swimmers to

take t—h’é’Panthers into camp with-
out too much trouble. The only
time Grady’s mermen were in
contention was after the 200-yard
backstroke when a first and sec-
ond in that event tied the meet at
30-30.

Record Erased

A Wolfpack junior who missed
qualifying for the past Olympics
by one-tenth of a second was the
star of the meet. Dick Fadgen,
NCAA breaststroke and butterfly
champion, won both the 200-yard
butterfly and the 200—yard breast-
stroke and also pitched in to lead
the 400-yard medley to the victory
that opened the meet. '

Fadgen’s time in the breast-
stroke cracked a PAA pool re-
cord that was set in 1955 by
another member of the ‘Pack.
Bob Mattson’s time of 2:31.?
was no match for Fadgen’s fast
2:26.6.

Another Stater, Frank Nauss,
who is a rtansplant from York,..
Pa., was the other double winner
of the meet.» He captured the 220
and 440-yard freestyle events, two
races in which he is the second
best in the nation.

The Panthers won only three
events. Lou Durbin, double ESCA
titleholder, took the 50-yard free-
style; Milo Fischer was at his best
in diving; and Don Weber won
the 200-yard backstroke. ,

Warne White, Bernie Bauer,
and Ed Robson, all of whom were
victorious in the Rutgers meet,

had to settle for runner-up posi-
tions Monday night.

the Panthers’ sixth man. Goode
led the way for the visitors as he
dropped in 23 points.

Akers followed Goode with 16
points. The fabled Jerry West,
named West Virginia's outstanding
scholastic basketball player of last
season, acquired four persons early

and had to play extremely con-.
seravtive ball. West scored only

six -points, but his ball handling
and play-making were nothing
short of sensational and a big
factor in the Mounties’ victory.

By an KOLTISKA
A crowd of 5,233 fans watched the Mountaineers of
West Virginia squeeze by the. Panthers 89-86 last night at

the Field House.

Hot Rod, H’undley continues to be a jinx against the

Jungle‘ Cats. The Oaklanders have#

yet to beat the Mountaineers at
the Field House while Hundley
has been on the squad. .

Coach Bob Timmons had his
ﬂoormen play possession ball the
ﬁrst half which enabled them to
take ‘a half-time lead of 43-42.

Mounties Take Lead
Although leading by one point
at the half, the Panthers lost the
ball long enough in the second
half to give West Virginia .3 45-43
lead with less than two minutes
gone. ~
From there on the Mountain-
eers never relinquished the lead,
although the Jungle Cats tied
West Virginia 67-67 on John
Riser’s ﬁeld goal with ten mni-
utes left in the game.

Lloyd Sharrar broke the tie
with a hook shot but Riser match-
ed it with a lay-up. Sharrar then
put the Mountaineers ahead for
good on a drive-in with eight
minutes remaining.

Hundley Plays Straight

The usually colorful Hundley set
aside his clowning last night for a
serious role by garnering 32 points
to lead both teams in scoring.

The big match between Hundley
and Don Hennon proved its worth
as both men led the scoring pa-

rade throughout the game. Hennon

Gymnast Team Opens
Against, West Chester

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnastics team opens its 1957
season on Saturday afternoon against West Chester State
Teachers with ace Tom. Darling in a handicapped condi-
tion. The veteran acrobat has had bursitis for several weeks

and will have to compete undei%

wraps. —

Despite, this disadvantage the
Blueand Gold, otherwise in ﬁne
shape, is a favorite in the opener.
Last year the

tine, Dave Ruber, Don Neeld,
Ron Kuhn, and John Cacolice.
The usual events of ﬂying rings,

horizontal bar, parallel bars,
.side horse, tumbling, and rope
climb will be exhibited.

Though favored, Coach Neiger
points out, “You never know when
a boy may break in his routine
and unexpectedly fail to pick up
his points.”

West Chester lost its opening
match in late December to Tem-
ple, another Panther opponent, by
a 61-35 score. They boast a broth-
er combination of Ted and Harry
Wil1iams,. which took two ﬁrsts
and a second against Temple.

Coach Neiger has recently re-
turned from the national gym-
nastics clinic- in Sarasota, Flor-
ida, where he coached an All-
Star team from the North
against a similar squad from
the South. In a. close battle the
Rebels won out, 541/; to 42%.

able information Japan, which ﬁn-
ished“ second to Russia in gym-
nastics got the “short end” of the
stick in the judging by Soviet
satellite oﬂicials.

They actually appeared to be
superior to the Reds, but the scor-
ers appeared to favor their com-
rades. The United States produced
their best team ever, even though
it ﬁnished far down in the list of
standings. Prospects for the fu-
ture appear to be excellent ac-
cording to many.

 

Inscribed in the ‘National Hall
of Fame of Football are two Pitt
players. In 1954 Bob Peck, Pitt’s
first All-American was electedas
the ﬁrst Pitt player. Jock Suther-
land, a great guard and later suc-
cessful coach at Pitt, was elected
among the ﬁrst coaches in 1953.

Clayce Kishbaugh and ’ Sharrar

‘ \ eers with 25 and 16 points re-

Three Panthers fouled out of the

Bucknell Tough
Coach Timmons’ ﬂoormen. Will
get little rest these next five days
with t h r e e g a m e s scheduled
against Bucknell, Penn State, and
Syracuse at the Field House. A

Thursday’s m e e t in g against
against Bucknell proves to be a
tough one for the Panthers. This
will be the eighth meeting be-
tween the two teams with the
Jungle Cats holding the lead, 5-2.

Although the Panthers decis-
ioned the Herd last season by
the score of 81-74, Coach Ben
Kribbs has a veteran squad re-
turning that won their ﬁrst sev-
en games before submitting to
West Virginia Tech in the Hof-

Tournament.

Unless’ Coach Kribbs has a last-
minute change of mind, he will
open with John Beatty, Charleroi,
and Norm Voorhees, Meadville, at

‘ forwards; Hal Danzig, Rochester,

N. Y., at center; and Marty Tan-
nenbaum, Hackensack, N. .J, and
Joe Baccelli, Niagara Falls, N. Y.,
at guards. This unit averages over
6-2»in height.

Penn State‘ Saturday
Filling in as the sixth man on
the squad will be 5-9 John Strizzi.
Bison‘ Coach Kribbs calls Strizzi
his best “pick up man in any
trouble situation.” he»-~
This stubby playmaker usiially

draws the opposition’s top point,

producer to guard if the differ-
ence in size isn’t too great. Up to
date Strizzi has hit on 59 percent
of his ﬁeld goals.

Following Bucknell to the
campus will be the Panthers’
keystone rivals, Penn State. The
Nittany Lions are enjoying the
edge in the series betweenthe
two schools, 44-41, with the Oak-
landers slowly closing the gap. ~

Last season the Jungle Cats set
a new team scoring record as they
connected for 100 points while
the Staters picked up 90 at Uni-
versity Park. The previous rectffd
was 97 points.

In their last home game before
hitting the road, Coach Timmons’
hoopsters will take on the Orange-
men of Syracuse. This will be a
must for the Panthers as the
Orangemen lead in the series '11-6.
Last year Syracues edged the Pan-

thers by the score of 82-79.

Matmen Face Cyclones

In Quest Of 19th Victory

Coach Rex Peery ﬁgures that it will take more than a
tornado to pin his matmen who havegwon 18 straight dual
meets. So when the Iowa State Cyclones blow into the

the Midwesterners to give his¢

highly-ranked grapplers one of
their most stringent tests of the
campaign. The starting time is
7:30 p.m. «

day’s 25-3 rout of Michigan was

Coach Harold Nichol’s matmen

just a little more caution than he

Panther Back
To Be Honored

Ray DiPasquale, Panther half-
back for the past three years, will

David Lawrence, Coaches John
Michelosen and Vic Fusia, Steel-
ers Nick Skorich and John Cenci,
and two of DiPasquale’s former
Central teammates, Don Schaefer
and Ed Vereb.

DiPasquale was used mostly on
defense this past season, but still
managed to score two touchdowns.

Another indication of the

Iowans’ strength is reﬂected by
the fact that they have two Big

Henry Ford Speaks A bout Pro Ba ll

Pro footballer Henry Ford
would do all hisperforming
before Pittsburgh crowds if
he had his own way. Henry,
ex-Pitt great, has been in the
big leagues for only one full
season.

In the transition from ‘college to
professional football he has cross-
ed a rather tough road. Aside from
the players being bigger, hitting
h a r d e r, a n d
p 1 a y i n g with
m o r e serious-
ness, he has ex-
p e r i e n c e d a
completely new
type of game.
Each player on
a p r o fessional
t e a m, he has
observed, spe-
cializes in one
individual skill
to contribute to
the success of the team.

In college, he says, ‘5-A team
too often depends on one indi-
vidual to carry the burden of
eleven men.” Since playing with
the Steelers he has concentrated

 

Ford

chieﬂy on defense, seeing only
limited action on offense.

Luckies
Taste Better

Of all the gridiron enthusiasts
Ford has played before, he feels
that Pittsburgh fans are the most
receptive. Their sportsman - like

attitude has given him a deﬁnite’

feeling of security during each
home game. He hopes to continue
playing in Pittsburgh until he feels
too “old.”

Following retirement as a play-
er, Ford plans on a local coaching
position either at the college or
professional level.

Ford agreed that the majority
of his teammates tower over his
5-10 frame, but explained that he
thought none of them had a great-
er desire to play ball and win than
he himself. Henry is the perfect

personiﬁcation of a reminder in

the Stadium training room saying,
“It’s not the size of the .men in
the ﬁght. It’s the size of the ﬁght
in‘ the men.” Continuing his phil-
osophy he expressed the thought
that no player with a will to play
ball with as much ability as oth-
ers will ever lose a game in his
heart.

Last December, the speedy
halfback reached the ﬁrst pla-
teau in his professional career
by scoring his ﬁrst and second
touchdowns in the play-for—pay

ranks. The only other exception-
al game he remembers is an ex-
hibition contest against the Los
Angeles Rams in Portland, Ore-
gon, in which he intercepted
four passes. .

Off the ﬁeld Henry works for a
local tire company where he is a
salesman. Atfer a hard day’s work
he enjoys listening to jazz trum-
peter Milt Davis and blues singer
Lena Horne." His appreciation of
jazz has enticed him to build quite
a large collection of the most well-
known artists.

From this short resume of Henry
Ford’sAac'tivities it is easily seen
that the Pittsburgh Steelers have
themselves a real potential leader
to help spark the club to the top.
