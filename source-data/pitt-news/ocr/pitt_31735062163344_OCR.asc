should be the correction of the
problem of America’s “shock-
ing waste of human resourc-

" es," ‘ Chancellor Edward H._ _

. Litchﬁeld recommended at Fall
Convocation last Wednesday.
As the first step in a ﬁve-point
, program to reduce the “immor-
ality” resulting from inequalities,
I and ‘waste of unutilized talent,
Litchﬁeld urged that the Univer-

. sity “must deliberately seek out”

the capable Negro citiz'ens, high
school students, and women in our

society who are not receiving,

Subsidation of individual areas

cepted, according. to the Chan-
cellor, as a second step. Im-
provement in counseling programs
at all levels, speciﬁc efforts, by

professional faculties to ﬁnd and
place‘ capable women and Ne-
groes, and creation of an “Edu-
_cation‘Core” were also suggested
by Litchﬁeld.

Seeks Commission

In_ the speciﬁc area of Negro
education, Litchﬁeld urged the
President of the United States to
appoint immediately a commis-
sion to address itself to the prob-
lem. If the Ghancel1or’s recom-
mendation is followed, this com-
mission would not only collect in-
. formation, but would also con-
struct ’and delineate active pro-
grams and engineer ways of car-

“This is a crystallization of one
of the major functions of Student
Government . . . helping students

Martin Landy.

the group would not be “a peren-

stead the committee is seeking a

I “Affirmative Action”

The Chancellor viewed his ﬁve-

the problem, which he considers
“one of the grave inequalities of
American life.” He urged every

Distribution Program

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

L The newly _revised Library Arts Cabinet will open its work ‘

by directing its attentions to short-comings in 80

and 180 series
distribution courses. '

A liason between the student body and Dr. Albert Martin,‘
dean of the School of Liberal Arts, the Cabinet will remain inde-

pendent of either of them.

Distribution courses were selected as the ﬁrst area of attack.

because “this area requires the most student feedback to Dean

Martin and this is one area in which the student body as a whole 5
has the most complaints,” noted Fern Chagrin, Cabinet member. "

Can Make Recommendations

Members of the Cabinet pointed ‘out that they are in 5’ post-I" O
tion to make recommendations to individual departments about‘

distribution courses in their ﬁeld. They-are always able to~make _
suggestions to Dean Martin about anything. He hasassured them’

of his full support.
The Cabinet is also concerned with the teaching quality
of a number of professors at the University.

Miss Chagrin stressed the point that the Cabinet “needs the ' V

student body to back us and give us its viewpoint on profes-
sors. We have no way of knowing about professors and courses
unless we are told by the student body.’

, ' Aware of Ideals

“.We are well aware that professors have high ideals con-

cerning ~their ﬁelds and we respect their scholarship; however,’
this alone does not constitute an interesting and proﬁtable class,

“Many of the professors are not aware of their short-
comings. It is the purpose of the Liberal Arts Cabinet to
bring to their attention the grievances of the student body.

“But we are only capable of doing this on the basis of student,

support.” ‘ V
’ No Support Last Time

A Liberal Arts Cabinet existed here about four years ago.
It died for lack of student support.

Successful similar organizations do exist at schools such-
as Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Through dis-
closing the inadequacies of certain courses, many problems
have been solved at these schools to the satisfaction of the
students, by means of the cooperation of the students.

“It is necessary that we receive well-founded, constructive
criticism in order to bringout tangible results,” stated Miss

Chagrin. “We ask that any student” taking courseslin the School.‘
of Liberal Arts having a complaint or criticism, please put it in

writing with illustrations to support his point.
Names Not Disclosed

“We would appreciate names and phone numbers on these I
letters in case we need further information. No names will at A

any time be disclosed without the permission of the author of
the letter.” '

Students may address letters to the Liberal Arts Cabinet
c/o the Student Union Desk. -
The members of the cabinet are: Fern Chagrin, Faith Kravitz,
Martha Holstein, Howie Solomon, Joe Seiger, and Steve Johnson.

Two weeks ago, The Pitt News
printed its ﬁrst Friday edition
complete with a lineup of the op-
posing teams in that Saturday’s
football game —— including names,
positions, and numbers. .

Last week, the Athletic De-
partment informed The Pitt News
that it would no longer be able
to ﬁnd space for the paper’s re-
porters on the Un_iversity’s char-
tered plane ﬂights to away ath-
letic events.

The Pitt‘ News, stated that the

ed that The Pitt News printed
the lineups.” Beano V Cook (Pub-
licity Director) has been work-
ing for years to get the coop-
eration of the downtown papers
in not printing the team lineups.
When The Pitt News brought
out the lineup, the downtown
papers scrapped the agreement,
and a lot of Beano’s work was
, wasted.”

.Cook, who ﬁrst informed The

VPitt News of Carver’s decision,

commented that “95 per cent of
all schools don’t take the college
sportswriter along on away trips.
I, ‘don’t know about the plane
space; that varies. But if we‘,do
have space, Bob Smizik (Sports
Editor "of The Pitt News) can
come along. He’ll have to pay his
of course.” °.
Never‘ Had To Pay

‘Smizik has never had to pay
his way in the past.

Carver, however, lmaintains
that the printing of the lineup
had nothing to do with his de-
cision. “It’s simply that there

‘ is no space on the plane. We

have a smaller plane this year;
even I can't get on it for the
away games.”

The only reason the Athletic
Department doesn’t want the line-
ups printed in a place outside the
program is, according to Carver,
“because .we’re u n d e ,r contract

this has. nothing to do with taking

“Don’t Like Idea” «

“I don’t like the idea of - tell-
ing our nationaladvertising rep-
resentative that the lineup is
available free in the school news-_
paper, as well as in the ofﬁcial
program. I thought there was an
agreement between The Pitt News
and the Athletic Department not
to-‘print the lineup.” _ .

Ralph Albright, lb usiness
manager of The Pitt-News, dis-5
agrees. "The agreement was
that The Pitt News would not

itself. In no way were we com-
mitted not to put the lineup in.

“It seems strange to me why
the Athletic ‘Department wants
to hinder a service to the stu-
_dents. The Athletic Department
and The Pitt News are not com—,
petitors. They are part-of one
organization — the University.
There should be no pettyconﬂict
between the two, and this, to me,
seems pretty petty.” V

“Had Funny Feeling”

“I had a funny feeling that
they would do this,” added Swe-
tonic. “We were threatened earli-
er in the year with a trick of
this sort ‘should we print the line-
ups, and they’ve fulﬁlled their
promise.” ' '

Smizik, who has now lost his
transportation to away games,
could only shake his head. “All
I know is that I was told .. I’m
not allowed on the plane because
we printed a Friday. team-line-
up in The Pitt News. It’s a lousy
deal.” . ’

Committee to Deal With Student}

Problems in Human Relations

(Continued from Page 1)
There is a need to solicit support
of students directly involved with
campus activities before such a
program can be undertaken, ac-

cording m Klelnberg.

Iron Out Orientation Flaws
The Orientation committee,
under Barbara McKeever, is seek-
ing to iron out any flaws in the
orientation setup. It was noted by
Miss McKeever that a lack of

contact with parents of freshmen
was evident in Freshmen Orien-
tation activities for the fall.

In addition to --groping with
the parents’ problem, the com-
mittee will air questions of
shorter or longer sessions;
earlier dates, and letters of wel-
come to freshmen students. ‘

The latter point was debated
somewhat. Several members of
the SG Senate cited cases where
incoming freshmen were ﬂooded
with letters‘ from University or-
ganizations prior to orientation
exercises.

SG’s Letter Official Welcome

It was decided SG’s letter to
freshmen should stand as an otﬁ-
eial welcome. All other organiza-
tional letters would be channeled
through the office of Dean Helen
P. Rush, dean of students — pred-
icated on an SG ruling.

Under such a procedure, offi-
cial organizational baptism for

freshmen students would come
at the Activities Fair.

.To help celebrate United Na-
tions’ Day (Oct. 24), the Interna-
tional Students’ committee has
announced it will co-sponsor an
International Week (Oct. 20-26).

by women.

’The consultant will then an-

nounce these needs, urge women

‘Ideas ‘And A

_ Figures’

By STAl\T STEIN

From a literary standpoint, the Fall 1963, issue of Ideas’ and,
‘/_,__y‘igures,i presents a curious mixture of the pretty good and the-very
bad.»To the ﬁrst category belong the four short stories. To the second
category belongs everything else, which, thankfully doesn’t amount

to very much.

As far as the poetry is concerned, suﬂice it to say that I trust the

undisciplined “lower case” school

of p_oets"wi1l eventually go the

way of the black-bottom and hula’

hoop—that is, out of vogue. I

a"dmire Ed. "Roberson’s prudence
 omittinghimself from his own

1 edition, but as a young poet who
has ,been judged by Atlantic
Monthly Magazine as among the
best, his work is sorely missed,

The short stories, however,

which made up the major. part
of the magazine, were, in gen-
eral well-written and commu-
nicative.

For sheer emotional shock, ﬁrst

‘prize must go to Jeff Rackam’s

0 “A Thought for Jamie.” ’Almost
too brutal in its impact, “A
‘Thought for Jamie” combined
childlike insights with adult-im-
ages to produce a story rich in
character and interest. The com-
bination was entirely successful
at the reader is left with the un-
expected feeling that \.'Jamie is
a little selﬁsh brat Whose main
;,trouble is that nobody pays much
—._,e'attention to him anymore.

Jamie makes a serious accu-
sation in the beginning of the
story, but by the ‘end, the be-
havior of the adults is completely
justiﬁed. The ‘sympathies of the-
reader are drawn immediately to
the boy,-until that moment when
he cries, “I told you it was going
to die.” It appears that the. au-

€:_.thor_has played a little trick on the
""” reader. The reader is drawn
along in the belief that Jamie is
the unfortunate victim of cruel
and thoughtless adults. The op-
posite, however, is the truth, '
“Lost Symbols,” by Jim Dalg-
lish, was, to this reviewer, the
surprise‘ story of the issue. It
was, far and away, the most
professionally written. The story
_ was- a surprise because, judg-
‘Liing from some of his earlier
.-- stories, he never seemed capa-
ble of this quality. His phrase-
ology was fresh and accurate
and his images were sharp and
clear. »

If the story’s main idea stands

. or falls on the character of Joyce,
however, than Dalglish has shot

—‘ a little wide of the mark. “It’s

~ human contact that teaches,”
Joyce says, but if we are to be-
0-...?;1ieve‘ his personality ' as Daglish
paints it, Joyce is not the most

. communicative of persons, even

K, to the-narrator. The ‘narrator, ad-
" mits that “J oyce, always seemed
to walk behind 7 me" and that
“His ‘problems were dark'to me.”
Yet, Joyce is a preacher of hu-
man contact. His disdain for and
aloofness from the rest -of the
Aéworld is made evident by the
narrator and belie any preoccu-

.. ypation with human contact.

. i It is possible that the author
intended this paradox, but. the
reader, infected by the narra- '
tor’s_ ignorance of his fI_-i‘end’s

' character, is given to believe

‘ that Joyce is a speaker, of truth.
This is really no minor point,
but the story is in general very
well handled- Its organization
is such that ﬂashbacks and dia-
logue" are ﬁtted in without a
bump in the fabric.

Character painting seems to be
the major problem of all the
stories in the new Ideas and'Fig-
ures. Kitty Kitson’s “Cast the
First Stone” is a short story.
That is, it is ploted and it builds
upon the suspense of a- particular
set of circumstances. The dia-
logue, accents and all, is well
heard, and the reader half ex-
pects, down to the surprise end-
ing, that Marie will carry off her
little gambit. In general the "char-
acters are well drawn and easy to
picture. Yet there is something
disturbing.

That disturbing quality is the
character of Greta. Physically,
she is perfect. She is the proto-
type of the huge Scandanavian
matron. But she is mentally un-
balanced. In itself this isn’t dis-
astrous. But there is no inkling
given of her imbalance. She is
characterized as just plain stupid.‘
Her sense of values is scrambled.
That she has the capacity to kill
is fair indication, however, of her
insanity, especially since she has
been billed as knowing the differ-
ence between right and wrong.

The story as a whole is enter-
taining and warrants study of
how to build suspense, as Ma-
rie’s- hopes are continually raised
and dashed, raised and dashed

again.

Baymer Gorr’s “Dad” is an-
other character sketch. It is, in
essence, the story of a man grow-
ing old. It is also a story about
which one ﬁnds little to complain
or about which to rave. The com-

panionship of the young man is a’

constant frustration of the older
man, even though he has the sat-
isfaction of being able to bag his
deer on the ﬁrst day -out. The
reader is left undecided, however,
as to whether to give sympathy to
the old"guy.lAt trmes he seems a
c’r'ybaby.' Yet: often the presence
of youth is}. a punctuation of, his
age." It is deﬁnitely a This-Way-
or-That story, -though also enter-
taining and interesting in its jux-
taposition of opposing forces-
youth and age, humour and pity.
, Despite some faults, graphically
and literarily, the Fall 1963 Ideas
and Figures . is the best that has
yet been published. It.is a tribute
to Ed Roberson, but no surprise
to this reviewer, "that the maga-
zine was executed with a sensi-
tive eye to what’ is and What is
not art. ’

The

Things usually start off calmly enough in this institu-

‘_ tion. Early last summer, we decided that it would be ‘a ﬁne

service to the student body if The Pitt News would publish
a Friday edition before each home footballgame which

‘would include sports features and columns, and the lineups

— . of the opposing teams. _
This, we ﬁgured, would pave the way for expansion of
1 the paper and would also save the students from having to
purchase the 50 cent ‘programs on sale up at the stadium

during each home game. , ‘
_The only difficulties we envisioned were interna_l ones.

- That was, of course, before the Athletic Department caught

wind of our plan.

The Athletic Department, it seemed, had a monopoly

' ‘on the lineups since The Pittsburgh Press cut theirs out of .

the Saturday edition, and they wished to keep things that

It’s tough to convince an angry athletic director and
publicity agent that a paper coming out on a Friday and

being distributed in the Cathedral and Towers will not

affect program sales on ‘Saturday up at the Stadium. In
fact, it was impossible. ' H

I We talked, we bargained, we compromised. To heck
with" the students, they said. No lineups -—— or no traveling

"with the team to away games. We thought we reached

an agreement. We printed. They fumed. No more trips.

The point in question is not that The Pitt News will now
be forced to pay for its own transportation. This is just
one of the many consequences of expansion. '

The important consideration is that the Athletic De- .

partment, by means of threats and ﬁnancial blackmail, has.

. attempted to regulate the editorial policy of this news-

paper to its own advantage.

Censorship  a dirty word, and whether it succeeds or
not does not detract from the crime. The purpose of this
newspaper is to serve the students, and any ‘attempt at
preventing The Pitt News from serving the student body
in the manner which the paper considers proper is an act
of censorship. A

The Athletic Department has attempted but has failed,

and has now exacted its revenge. But you can still pick ‘

up, your lineups on Friday before, each home football
game — free!

'-Believe it or Not . . .

  They’re Human!

There is still a chance that this school
may someday be integrated. Ten years from
now, perhaps, a_ kid who happens to play
fullback for the football team may be walk-
ing through the Student  "   
Union, and a freshman will
nudge his buddy and say,
“See that guy, he’s in my
composition course. He’s an
English major.” _

What’s this? Heresy. No
mention that his buddy

   
   

the terror of ..the Monga- 
hela Valley, played in the _ 
‘f‘Big 33" game, and had 18; scholarship’ of-
ers. -

That’s the way we think it will be." So
he plays football. But, most important, he’s
a student.

Long looked at as the guys who have to
shave’ the most in freshman camp, the foot-
ball players are going to be an integral part
of the student body. , ‘

The school has taken a forward step in
that direction this football season-with a
great promotional idea which is not only

entertaining, butalso a means of integrating '

the football players with the ‘just plain’ stu-
dents. ' v

Last Wednesday the ﬁlms of the UCLA
football game in Los Angeles were shown
to the students in the lower lounge of the
Student Union. It hasn’t been as packed
since busty June Wilkinson, a protege of
Playboy, appeared to plug “Pajama. Tops.”

Three football players narratedthe ac-
tion. And I think the audience. gained a
better appreciationof the fellas when they
heard them talk and explain the action.

Yeh, they learned that they’re actually
human. They speak, they smile, and when
they take off those iron cages, they actually
look like you and me, only a little bigger
in most cases. i '

Fraternities vs. House System . . .

  I 4 Serving. .a

By Jim O'Brien
Captain Al Grigaliunas, Paul Martha and

Rick Leeson took turns at the mike. Each
laughed‘ at their own follies, underplayed
their own great moments, and were sar-
castic about the play of their peers. And the
exciting action on the screen kept the stu..
dents cheering and shrieking as though they
were in the stands. -

‘,‘This is what wewant,” says athletic di-
rector Frank Carver. f‘We want the boys to
be partof the University community. Not
obscure people who wear shoulder pads.”

I The ﬁlm also added to the excitement of
the upcoming game against Washington.
It’s the sort of thing that provokes student
interest. A student is far more apt to em-
pathize with the players on the ﬁeld if he
can ﬁnd some identiﬁcation with the Satur-
day afternoon hero. '_

The Student Union Board says. this
practice will be continued after every a_way
game_ this year, except for the West Vir-
ginia game which will be telecasted locally.

It might not be a bad idea for the athletic
department to even extend a program of

this sort. They might sent some of the play- _

ers around to speak to various organiza-
tions, or even have some Midday Series-

‘type programs.

The coaches could consider going to the
fraternity ond sorority houses, and sitting
down among the students and talking to.
them, answering their questions, and giving
them someinsight into the activities of the
athletic program. '

I realize that the football coaches al-

"ready have a back-breaking schedule, and

that they seldom. see enough‘ of their famil-
ies, but I think the end results would be
worth the effort. ' '

Even if it meant having to cut into the

I ticket revenue at the Stadium by being

forced to expandathe studentseating section.

Purpose

Fraternity was just another way of spel-

A ling party to me last year. But now the

superﬁcial, brightly colored illusion has fad-'
ed; a more meaningful, more intense pic-

terview both Parker

ternities, and Peter Bijur,
president of Men’s Dorm
Council this trimester. Sur-

 

them told me basically th
same thing, that each of "
their groupswas striving
for brotherhood and team— , V v ----- -- -~ 
spirit, a sense of belonging to and working
fora group. = A . '

And these are two entities, fraternities
and the new house system in the towers,

 

_that I had previously thought were so dia-

metrically opposed. ~ _ .
The similarity of what each of these men

-had told me was so striking, that I asked a U
_ fraternity man wholived in the Towers if

he felt any close resemblance between his

, fraternity and his “house”, if he felt that the

house system could ever replace the frater-
nity system. » _ '

His answer was an emphatic “no.”'

His explanation corresponded closely
with what I had‘ learned through my own

‘ _ experiences at the University. Your friends
-can’t be chosen for you._Just because you

are living with someone does not mean that
you are going to like that person or want
him for a close friend. I ’ _

And being requested to live with the
same people for four years is not going to
make you like them any better.

When someone joins a fraternity he
chooses the‘one,_ or at least should choose
one, whose members’ interests coincide with
his own. Instead of choosing one friend at
a time he chooses‘ ‘many. a 

As for the spirit of brotherhood, that
comes from the close friend-ships that one
forms. ' * W ~ ‘

     
 
   

    

~ It has been. my observation. that. most .: ;

 

‘By Marcia Bernstein

people‘ tend to identify with some group or
other. I have met very few people who
could identify solely with themselves and
operate effectively. .
‘And to identify with any particular
group one has to like it, "its ideals and its
members. One has to want to be associated

_ with themembers and have his name linked I

with theirs. . ,

Many people seem.to need this identi-
ﬁcation before they can go out into the
University world and make a name for
themselves in any area that interests them..

At ﬁrst, one might be tempted to con-
demn these individuals as weak and to call
the fraternity a crutch. But looking more
deeply into it, I think that it is fairly ob-
vious that a fraternityexperience is also ‘a

- maturing process.

During pledging, pledges may be brought
low; but theyare also taught humility. The
cockiness is knocked out of them. And they

‘learn how to function more effectively as

individuals in a group.

This experience is often needed by many
fresh-man coming to college after being big
men on campus in high school. Once a per-
son learns how to act in a group, it is often
easier for him to make the plunge and join

activit_ies,'more- conﬁdent that he will be '
accepted by this more “sophisticated” group .

if he doesn’t act “loud”-just to make him-
self known. ‘ - ~ '

A Although there may be things wrong
with the fraternity system at the University,
I feel that it does the University an inval-

uable service. It gives the school, and the i

organizations in the school, more mature
men. I don’t mean to imply that any inde-
pendent is immature or worthless. There
are many people that don’t need a frater-
nity. There are also many that ﬁnd some-
thing else.

But for those that fraternity does help

9 “get settled”, we should ',be thankful. For

from them-Iwe draw many of our student

leaders —— people that the University would 
be much worse off’ "h i 5 ' ' .  I ~

NAACP Attacks
‘Not Guilty’ Column

The Editor, The Pitt News:

In his MI‘.
Stein asks the wrong question.
“How do you plead White Man?"
he demands. ‘James
did not single out white Ameri-
cans for condemnation; he said
“all/America” is to blame. Every

recent column,

person who does nothing is re-

sponsible for the perpetuation
of discrimination. .
“I have done everything that

I can do as an individual to

make this society as free and

._ open to_myself as well as to any

of my associates,” Mr. Stein in-
forms us. But what have you

done? Why, for example, haven’t '

you attended any NAACP meet-

ings? As an individual you

could join ‘others in combatting

discrimination and segregation.

Sins of omission are as ‘bad!

as sins of commission. If you
saw a burning building, would
you _contend yourself with talk-
ing with those who escaped the
ﬂames or would you try to help
those trapped inside? An. ap,_a-
thetic aids the “Prejudiced mi-
nority” by its very indifference.

You also tell us not to blame
the American system but to
blame the Wallaces instead. We
do not condemn the American
system in toto. We condemn only
that perverted part of the sys-

tem that puts men like Wallace\‘

in power or cond‘ones discrim-

ination in any way. Yet,_ We .

cherish that part of the system
(the democratic part) which en-
ables us as individuals to col-

lectively ﬁght any discrimina-

tory practices.

You imply t h a t. Mississippi

Negroes are to blame for the
scarcity of Negro lawyers. Such
reasoning smacks of prejudice
or ignorance. It is ’a sociological
fact that discrimination. and
years of overt and covert segre-
gation negatively affects moti-
vation. Even if a Negro con-
qures the fear thatalthough he
acquires a professional degree he

may not be allowed to practice_

freely, another basic question
must be answered. How many
Negroes in Mississippi could af-
ford a college education? A I

For Second Column

The ‘Editor, The Pitt News:
Dear Mr. Stein:

Once before I had occasion.
' to write to you in ‘reference to

an editorial. It seems that the

time has come again for us to _

differ. The last time, as you

probably recall, was in refer-
ence to your column ‘The Mag-
got-Diggers’ in which you chose
to attack the Ad-Hoc Committee
on Racial Discrimination. This
‘time’ it is .in reference to‘ your
column entitled ‘Not Guilty.’

All of us are guilty, even as
all men are guilty of murder

in the time of war. We all share"
in the blame for allowing a,
climate to exist. in which four,

school-children could be blasted
to death. We all share some bur-
den of guilt for allowing preju-
dice, ‘intolerance and hatred to
exist. .

I am fairly certain_that Mr.
Meredith did not intend to imply
that you.were a mule. You im-
ply that Mr. Meredith deliber-
ately the audience.
Surely you donlt believe that
in allof the. University of Pitts-
burgh there is only one person
who is intelligent enough to re-
alize that he ~ was insulted 
Mr. Stan Stein. 7

You say you have worked
with us, gone to school with us,

insulted

roomed ‘with us, and discussed
with us what you have’never

discussed with .any white. Do"
you think this singles you out

for special recognition? We ask
no one to treat us in any special

‘manner, or to discuss with us,

“personal things” that you would
What.
we are seeking is equality —-

 bear that word in mind Mr.
Stein — n o t superiority but
, equality.

We blame ‘the Wallaces, the
Barnetts, the Faubuses — and
yes we blame you, the so-called
“informed” person who writes
dangerous, hate—ﬁlled, prejudice
riddled editorials. We blame you,
me and the American system,
because we all, each and every-
one of us ha.ve proved inade-
quate for the job that must be
done. , _

You say you have done every-
thing you can to make society

. free and open to yourself and

your" “associates.” I wonder how
many Negroes are among your
associates. -

_ With whom do you Work now ‘

Mr. Stein? ,In ‘what neighbor-

hood\do you live? With whom,

do you room? Have you even
ever remained silent when
others have attacked a minority
group‘? Have you/ ever really
had a Negro friend? Answer
these questions honestly and
then tell me that you have done
“everything.”.

You cried when you had no
shoes. I cry too, Mr. Stein. I cry
because of the bitterness locked
up inside, you that makes you
lash out against all those who
would seek equality. Wear well
the shoes that ﬁt so perfectly.

‘Tex’ Stein Called

‘Quick on the Draw

The Editor, The Pitt News:
Let’s calm down a minute, Mr.
Ston. ’ ‘
First, sir, nobody said you
were a mule. That anecdote was
not originated by Mr. Meredith

_for the civil rights issue. It is

ancient, and any insulting ref-
erence it might. once have had

has surely passed with the years.

Besides, isn’t it a little silly to

take offence at a harmless joke '

which, if it isssomewhat anti-
white, is at. least so in‘a hu-
morous rather than _a bitter
way? . ' .

Second, nobody wants you to '
be the scapegoat of history, not’

even Mr. Meredith. He said, “It
is the system, not the individual,

that produces conﬂict,” and you, -
‘ sir, are not a system any more

than you are a mule." What Mr.
Meredith’ meant, I believe, is
that, in America, the combina-
tion of time and classes and
races formed a system in which
exploitation .,of Negroes ﬂour-
ished — that is the /guilt (or

A characteristic or a c c i d e n t or

what you will) of America, and
we, as the sole inheritors of
this system of exploitation, are
the only ones who can elimin-
ate it, and that we don’t is our
collective guilt, or characteris-
tic, or whatever other insulting
word you choose to substitute.
If we can’t,blame. the American
system for the racial-situation,
who shall we blame? You say

.“hate, fear, and prejudice are

human elements; they are not
inherent in the system.” True
for you sir, but I did not hear
Mr. Meredith propose to elim-

inate hate, fear, and prejudice. ‘

I heard him propose'to elim-
inate hate, fear, and prejudice
against the’Ainerican Negro, and
this, like it or not, is "inherent
in the system. '

' Just one other observation.
You say that “most of the aud-
ience (which heard Mr. Mere-

dith) did not know when they7

were being insulted, “or they
would have booed. him 0 ” Did
it ever occur to you it, just may
be the other way around, that,
in spite of some startling "words,
Mr. Meredith was not out to in-
sult white pepole, and that most
of them had humor j and sense

enough to recognize this?
I wouldsuggest, sir, that you
are a bit quick on the trigger.

strong emotional appeal con-
founds the key word "you used

The University’s optimistic cheerleading squad knows
where the Panthers are going this season and aren’t keeping

' it a secret.

1

In anticipation of a great season, the squad is encouraging
student spirit. -and support. Last week" they taught the sor-

time, also, with‘ no increase in

three away games -- West Vir-

that “since Pitt is such a big foot-

have the fullest support possi_l:_>_l_e

Pep rallies are planned for the
Friday before each home game.
This Fridayin front of the Stu-
dent Union the California Pep
Rally was billed. The assistance of
the Greeks and the “new non-
apathetics” promises to greatly
increase the spiritus Pantheritis
epidemic.

“The squad .ismuch more en-
thusiastic than ever before” ac-
cording to junior, Carol Fried-
man. “And with the added en-
thusiasm of the students we'll

_ really have a great season.”

_ Ricky Caplan, Steve Lowe, and
Carl Kaplan, Liberal Arts sopho-
mores, and Rich Minker, account-

. ing junior, the new male ’cheer-

leadsr echo Carol’s expectations;
“The student. body deﬁnitely has
more spirit. The spirit competi-
tion, will also stimulate school
support this year.” ,
Looks Forward to Winning Season
After the pep rally last Thurs-
day and Saturday’s second dazzling

victory, junior Merle Landau ex-
pressed her pleasure. “It was
great to see everybody partici-
pate. The ﬁrst pep rally was a big
success and we can all look for-
ward to a winning season.” i ’
The new women cheerleaders,
LA sophomores, Dyanne‘ Hoch-
man and Patti Green agree that
cheers are a necessary part of
the game. They feel ‘ that the
“potential of the team is as fan-
tastic as the potential of the
school.”

Dyanne, a booster organizer
from her high school days, be-
lieves that a “good team or school
is not a ﬁnky thing -— but some-
thing to be really proud of.”

Panther Evasive

At ﬁrst, attempts to interview

the Panther failed. He kept \run-:

'ning around his cage mumbling

“Gr—r-eat.” Finally. Ken Sacks,
the Panther by any other name,
roared: “If I were to say we were
going to go undefeated I’d be ac-
cused of bragging but then if I
were to say we might lose a game,
I’d be lion. I’ll choose the lesser
of _the two evils and brag.”
Captain B a u m g a r t, , aptly
summed up the hopes of the
cheerleaders. ‘fln my four years at
Pitt I've been looking forward to
a bowl game; and this year I
think our Panthers will make it!”

The Universityfchapter of the

(NAACP) presented their position
on the article written by Stan
Stein, Pitt News associate editor,
entitled “Not Guilty” to Matt
Swetonic, editor of The Pitt News
at an executive meeting. Swetonic
in turn presented the paper’s
position.

‘At the meeting, held last
Thursday, Ralph Proctor, chair-
man, stated that “we are not try-‘

main objection is that we don’t

“The article ‘was beautifully
written, but it was poor journal-

by way of letters.’.’ Swetonic
went on to explain that t h e
letters written by the group

would be in the paper. He said
that the only pre—requisites for a
column were that they be “well
written and not libelous.”

"‘We have an obligation to
print the opinions of the
-column Writers, and also to
print your opinions in regard to
theirs,” Swetonic‘ explained.

Proctor then asked “can we be
assured that if Mr. Stein continues
to write this type of a column we
will be given ample space to an-
swer?’7 The answer was a deﬁnite
“yes” from ‘Swetonic. _

Stein also spoke with the com-
mittee’ about his column.

In other business the commit-
tee discussed the housing problems
in the area. John Sigel, a com-
mittee member, explained ‘ the
state law which says’ that anyone
who controls selling or renting

holds is not permitted to discri-
minate.

“We want to make it known
that students can ﬁle a com-
plaint or talk to the committee
or state human relation depart-
ment if they are refused service
in public establishments,” Sigell
said.

Proctor emphasized the fact
that “the committee is not only
concerned with the Negro pro-
blem, but with discrimination in
general.”

Jim syphers, another member,
suggested that a car-pool be set
up so that members of the Uni-
versity NAACP could participate

in the picketing for the United"

In The Spotlight 

With Stan Schweiger

It is my sincere pleasure to be able to report that “Lord of the
Flies” has been transformed to the screen with tenderness, delicacy,
and, most important of all, great faith. The transformation of William
Golding’s enormously /successful and controversial parable, from the
pages of albook to the action, of a motion picture screen is one of the
most faithful and valid adaptations that I have seen. ” ‘

Theater,_ is far from a‘ perfect mo-

tion ‘picture. It has its deﬁnite
faults, but they seem to be of a
minor note, and do not detract
from the total effect and message
of the work. The director-scenar-
ist, Peter Brook, isthe man whom
al_l honors and praise must be
showered upon. He, along with

. producer Lewis Allen, is taking a

great chance with this ﬁlm, and
that is evident right from the out-
set. Instead of “name” stars to
portray the group of English
schoolboys who are marooned on
an uninhabited island, Mr. Brook
has chosen 25 youngsters who are
known only around their own
They are com-
pletely unknown and have never
been/seen by movie audiences.
Herein lies one of the main
faults-of the picture. Quite often,
the boys display their
amateurishness clearly
in taking directorial
cues, and appear to be
stilted and uneasy
awaiting their turn to

puses and, during the. past few
years, has sold more paperbacks

the symbol of law and

order, does not come off too suc-
cessfuly. These are faults that
can’t be blamed on the ﬁlm
makers because one can put just
so much into a ﬁlm until the one-
ness of the ﬁlm product ‘is for-.
gotten and the novel becomes the
main focus on the part of the
audience.‘ V .

3 Mr. Brook’s choices for the im-
portant principles ‘are quite imag-
inable and accurate _
to Mr. Golding’s symbolism
Aubrey as Ralph, " A°¢"r“'l'e
the symbol of order,
reason and justice; Tom Chapin as
Jack, the symbol of lawessness
and distatorship; and Tom Gaman
as Simon, who suspects the bar-
barism inherentin human nature,
are well cast from every angle.
But it is Hugh Edwards as Piggy,
the _knowing andﬁpractical asth-
matic who symbolizes reason, who
pulls a Willie Sutton and com-
pletely steals the picture. His per-
formance is one of great poi-
gnancy and emotion, and I felt
very touched and absorbed while
watching this talented youngster
perform. Thelscene where Piggy
tells the story of Camberly to the
“littleuns” is one I will never

/forget.

As _I previously stated, “Lord of
the Flies” is far from a great pic-
ture. But it is a true labor of love
on the parts of Mr. Brook and his
companions. They" have tried to do
justice to Mr. Golding’s novel in
a -way that would make everyone
connected with it very proud "of
their combined creative effort. All
of the people involved get a great
big “A” for effort from this critic.
I was moved, shocked, and de-
lighted with the ﬁlm and earn-
estly recommend it to all as a job
well done. i '

BOOM!
Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the

population explosion. Only la-st.week four people exploded in

Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup.
In case you’rc thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—-a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old
girl ‘in Nortliﬁcld, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a
near miss in High Point, North Carolina-—an eight-year-old
boy who was saved only by thequick thinking of his cat, Fred,who
pushed the phone oil the hook with his muzzle and dialed the
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have
been more logical for Fred to dial the ﬁre department, but one 4
can hardly expect a cat to summon a ﬁre engine which is fol-
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?) ’ q ,’
But I digress. The population explosion," I say, is upon us.
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because I
feel sure that science will ultimately ﬁnd an answer. After all,

  
  

  
 

,....-.ar;:aI1. -'

has not sciencein recent years brought us such marvels as the

- maser, the bevatron, and the Marlboro ﬁlter? Oh, what a saga” ,

of science was the discovery of the Marlboro ﬁlter! Oh, what a.
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse-

verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the '

Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding

one ﬁlter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony, _

obsidian, poundcake—ﬁnally emerged, tired but happy, from
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect ﬁlter
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we

- light! up a Marlboro which-comes to us insoft pack and Flip-

Top Box in all ﬁfty states and Cleveland!
Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from
the population explosion,’ but meanwhile America’s colleges

are in dire straits. Where can we ﬁnd classrooms and teachers '

for today’s gigantic inﬂux of students? _ . _

Well ‘sir, some say the solution is to adopt the trimester sys-
term. This system, already in use at many colleges, eliminates
summer vacations, has three semesters per annum ‘instead’ of
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.

This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? Even under
the trimester system the student has occasional days off. More-
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind

/of a1l—out attack that is indicated? I

I, say no. I say desperate situations call’ for desperate reme-
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I“
say. we must do no less than go to school every single day of
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 24
hours of every day! ' ‘

The beneﬁts of such a program are, as you can see, obvious.
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all
the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. Second, the
teacher shortage will disappear because allthc night watchmen
can be put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration
drama. And ﬁnally, overcrowding will disappear because every-

Self-realization and self-help,
be it with academic, personal or
vocational problems, are the goals
of the University Counseling
Service. - -

Although some students are re-
ferred to them by Administrative
personnel, most of the students
that the counselors see are self-
referred. Many come on the re-
commendation of their friends.
According to Dr. Warren Hill, act-
ing director of the University
Counseling Center, sometimes 12,
13 or 14 referals will result from
one case.

“The type of problems run the
gamut of human problems,” said
Dr. Hill. “Usually, the problem
here is that the student needs to
clarify what he is. We try to help
the student get an accurate self-
picture through conversation.”

Provides Relaxed Atmosphere

Dr. Hill emphasized that the
counseling service tries to provide
a warm, relaxed atmosphere and
counselor for the students.. Each
student going for couseli-ng is

Not Blank Walls

The counselors at the Univer-
sity Counseling Service do not
consider themselves as blank
walls. They believe in “establish-
ing a personal relationship with
the students. We don’t run any-
body’s life here or tell anybody
what to do. Nor do we judge what
they say. We try to‘ give the stu-

selves.” -

Dr. Hill observed that “talk-
ing about themselves was a
new experience for many stu-
dents coming ‘in for counseling.
The self answering of questions
gives students deeper insight
into their personalities and in-
terestsl This insight is requisite
for the ‘solving of vocational,
personal, and academic, pro‘-
blems.”

The questions most often an-
swered for the student coming in
for counseling are ‘Where do you
want to go?’ and ‘Do you feel at
home in your own body?’ The an-
swers to these questions point to

_.. Local Citizen Group Organizes

/To Protest Oakland Renewal

A newly-organized citizens group protesting the rede-
velopment of Oakland is calling a mass meeting tonight at
8 p.m. in the American Legion Hall, 117 S. Bouquet.

Under the name “The Citizens Committee to Save Oak-
land From the Ravages of Redevlopment,” ten local residents
joined forces several weeks" ago. According to Chairman

in

7!’

 

Eugene De Pasquale, the group¢

has been circulating petitions

tions stating opposition “to any
attempt to redevelop ‘Oakland,
take our homes, properties, ‘and
businesses.”

Almost 3,000 persons have sign-

, ed the petitions, .which are to be

sent to urban redevelopment
agencies, in .Harrisburg, Philadel-
phia and‘ Washington. De Pas-
quale epxlains that he is not
sending them to local agencies be-
cause “I’ve been into all the urban
redevelopment meetings here and
they just don’t listen.
Like Playing with Blocks

“To me it’s like playing with
blocks, they just pile them up and
tear them. down. They don’t ever
consider the human element.”

The group’s complaint is ex-
pressed in De Pasquale’s state-
ment that “We’re concerned
about the whole redevelopment
proposal from Boundary Street
to Craft Avenue. We're against
the whole eﬁort. All of a sud-
den, people are calling Oakland
a slum and that begins to sound
like a. land grab to us.” 1

Several members of the group
have been notiﬁed that their
houses will be taken, but no
prices have been quoted. De Pas-
quale does not know whether or
not his house will be removed.

The citizens committee was
formmed independently of such
other "protesting groups as. the
Chamber of Commerce and at-
torneys.

De Pasquale is president of
Local 508 Pittsburgh Baseball
Club ‘Employees ' Union. His co-
chairman is Nichalos Diulus.

Panther  Backs  Run Over California}

 

Bears’ Defense Unable to Stop Cat
Running, Passing in 35-15 Triumph

Bears Wealiest Foe

 

' By l\'IARV ZELKOVVITZ . g
e . The Panther backs ran through the California line here Saturday like water through
burlap, rolling up a 35-15 victory over the Golden Bears. » -
"‘Pitt’s offense was very impressive,” Cal coach Marv Levy said after the game.

California showed brilliant running and excellent
blocking Saturday — for 12 seconds — before ﬁnding its
level and proving to be little more than a stiff scrimmage
for John Michelosen’s team. ' V ‘ A

None of the Pitt coaches would admit it, but Cali-
fornia was the weakest team to face the Panthers this
season. They simply were not in the same class with the
Panthers. Aside from having a 
potentially ﬁne quarterback, the

was small and inexperienced and "
caused quarterback
Craig Morton much anguish by
consistently dropping on-target
passes.

Beating such a team is no ac-
complishment. Beating such a

an accomplishment. They display-
ed a well-balanced ‘offense of pass-
ing and running and‘ two back-

ﬁelds that could move theball with equal adeptness.

 The showing of the second unit was especially heart-
ening to Michelosen, after the shabby performance the
“B” team put on against Washington. _

The Panther performance did not pass California
coach Marv Levy. “They looked good against, us last
year,” Levy said referring to the Panther’s 26-24 win at
Berkeley. “But this year they execute their plays much
better. They have the added experience which is quite

helpful.” A

The statistics back up Levy's statement about
better execution. Pitt’s total oﬁensive ﬁgure was 446
yards. This prompted press box announced Don Neft
to quip, ‘?Today’s total offense ﬁgure exceeds the
combined totals of the 1960, 61 and 62 season.’.’

The statement ‘was abit of an exaggeration, but the
way the Panthers were moving the ball it almost. seemed ‘
true.

1 Coach Ernie Hefferle gave a good bit of the credit to
the ﬁne offensive showing toquarterback Fred Mazurek.
“That defensive line has got to watch Freddy,” Hefferle
said. “He’s such a threat with the ball that he takes a lot
of pressure off the rest of our backs.” . .

‘ There was little pressure on other Panther backs as
they repeatedly ripped through the Bears’ line for long
gains. It wasn’t just the usual name like Martha, Leeson
and Crabtree that were breaking through for" good
yardage. _ 1 ,

A pair of third-string sophomores, Barry McKnight

. and Dale Stewart gave promise of better things ‘t'o.come.

McKnight ran 14 yards for a touchdown. He must, how-

1 , ever, beat out Leesona and John Telesky, a doubtful hap-

pening, if he is "to play more. . .
Stewart’s chances of seeing more action are con-
siderably better. He picked up 39 yards on six carries .
and threw the key block on McKnight’s touchdown
run. The left-halfback immediately ahead of Stewart,
Bob Roeder, has not run particularly well in the ﬁrst
three games and chances are Stewart will be playing
more in the future. '
Michelosen said, “Stewart looked like he was ﬁnding.
himself today. I hope he keeps coming.”
There were many standouts in the line also. Ernie

ABorghetti was named lineman of the game. ‘Most of

Borghetti’s votes-probably came on the strength of one
of the most vicious blocks ever seen at the Stadium.
It happened in the first quarter on a reverse. Borg-

- hetti pulled out" of the line to pick up any trailing de-

fenders. The Cal player never saw Borghetti, coming and
was smeared. He had to be helped off the ﬁeld. The, rest
of California’s team should have taken the hint. A !

The sophomore quarterback
also impressed Levy. “Lucas
was a very impressive passer,”
- he said. . . ,

Fred Mazurek, Panther starting
quarterback, impressed Levy. “We

A was better than we had heard.

Becomes a Passer

“If a boy is a greattrunner and,
normally, just a fair passer, he be-
comes a good passer just because
of his running ability,” Levy said.

The Panther total ‘offense sta-
tistics were also very ‘impres-
sive. ‘The Panthers picked up
196 yards passing, and 269 yards
rushing for a. 465 yard ,, total
offense mark. California picked .
up 206 yards- through the air,
and 79 on the ground for "a 285
yard total. The Bears, however, '
lost four fumbles. ,

“If we would have held on to
those balls, the game mighthave
been a little closer,” Levy said,
“but let’s not take anything away ,
from Pitt. They beat us . . . That’s
all there is to it.

“Pitt was a superior team,”
Levy said, “They’re deep, well

p./Vew Athletic Unit Offers Many Facilities

By LARRY BERNFELD .

Sweeping changes in’ the University’s
physical education program will follow the
construction of the new athletic facilities now
being, built across from the Field House, ac-
cording to athletic director Frank Carver.

Faculty members associated with the new
’ developments share Carver’s strong positive
feelings. Margaret E. Covert, the co-ordina-
tor of the women’s physical education pro-
gram, said she would like to develop Wom-
en’s teams in tennis and gymnastics once
the new facilities are completed. A
Miss Covert said, “We would like to
— sponsor women’s sports on a collegiate level
in the forms of invitational tournaments.”
According to Carver the new 1 building
will attach behind and on the side of Trees.
P001 to form the pattern of a big H.
— Eleven Handball Courts
Carver said, “The crossbar of the H-shaped
plant‘ will contain classrooms, visual-aid
rooms, office space and rooms or teacher
training. The basement level will consist of
11 handball courts, which may also be used
for squash. On the same ﬂoor there will also
be an all-purpose room for women’s archery,
golf and fencing.
The main building will attach to the
crossbar and parallel Trees Pool. The fold-
ed-roof type of construction used in the

/ pool building will also be present in the

main addition. Inside there will be a clear
span of 125 feet. This area contains. ﬁve
full size basketball .courts — threefor men
and two for women.

In addition to‘ the basketball courts there
is a gymnastics area on the drawing board.
These six sections are strictly for intramurals
and have not been designed for spectator

 

intramural program. Students will have a

‘real choice of activities. There.will be real

incentive-for students, especially commuters,
to participate.” .

 

 

“This will be our ﬁrst home ﬁeld since I

have been connected with the University.”
Lewis, who played ball for Pitt from 1949-
1951, has been coaching since 1955. During
this time the team has called Schenely Oval,
Pitt Stadium, Mellon Field, and Leech Farm
as their home. ‘
Quite a Change

“It will be quite a change to be able to

walk across the-street from the home games.

This, in turn, should stimulate student» inter-,

est in baseball. We expect ‘large turnouts to
support our teams in the future.”

The basement level of the new build-
ing will house remedial suites for those stu-.
dents unable to participate in intramurals
and other activities. Specially’ trained
teachers will work in these rooms to help a
disabled students. 4

Dr. Karl Oerman, head of the Physical
Education Department, feels the corrective
rooms are a much needed facility in the

- University community.

Help Many Students
“The University should have "faced up to
the need for extensive corrective programs
a long time ago,” Dr. Oerman said. “This

U corrective program,” he continued, “wil1 ex-

tend to a large group of students, not only

those in wheelchairs, but post-operatives, stu-
dents with muscle weakness, Weak vision 0

Also on the basement level will be a
large" physical education laboratory man-

 ned by people working with the health

professions, psychology and other related
_ﬁelds. a

The Fraternity B League of the
intramural softball loop ended in
a tie between Pi Kappa Alpha and
Gamma Delta. Delta Tau Delta
had a chance to be in the ﬁrst
place tie but‘ they dropped their
last game to Phi Gam, 6-5.

The game was tied until the
ﬁfth inning when Bill Stewart hit
a homer to give the Delts a 5-3
lead. In the sixth Phi Gam’s Bill
Baloh hit a homer to bring them
to within one -run.

JOHN TELESKY
Fullback

John Telesky, the walking
refrigerator, doesn’t speak
icily when he refers to Rick
Leeson,’ the man who has re-
legated him to being the No.-
2 fullback on the football
team. ’ ‘ _ g p '

“With the schedule Pitt. plays,”
John says, “there is a need for at
least two teams. I guess there’s a
little more honor ‘being oh the"
first squad, but ‘I won’t complain
as long as I’m playing.

“If I_was on the secondteam
and not seeing any action,‘then
I’d say something about it.”

Blasts Through Line

Telesky does ‘see a lot of action,

not just because Leeson ‘has to

.eatch his breath every so often,

but because he is a ﬁrst-rate bully

' with a ball tucked in his stomach.

When John blasts through the
line, his teammates shake their
heads," and cry, “There goes the
bulldozer!”

A glance at John_’s neck-
-(which begins just below his
ears if it’s_ possible to deter-
mine) reveals that his founda-
tion‘ is -second only to the
Rockefeller one _for support.
He’s 5-10, 205 pounds, ‘squared.

’Day-by‘-day he’s a ‘better foot- I

ball player than Leeson,'who ad-
mits to being a Saturday after-
noon ballplayer — which are the
best kind to start on» Saturday
afternoon. ' _' ” ~ "
Married Three Years
Ricki Leeson isn’t'the only one

that Telesky supports either. Hew,

has been married forthree years
and is the only father on the
squad (according to the football
brochure), and has two ‘daughters.
His wife Iwas his high school
sweetheart‘ at .B1oomsburg High;
and "he continued to date? her
when she enrolled at Penn State.
Telesky had about 35'college
offers, but he‘ thought it best to
go to Pitt. “Because I was going
steady I didn’t do much travel-
ing to other schools,” he said.
"I’d pretty much made up my‘
mind on Pitt anyway.‘ They had
a reputation‘ tor playing tough
football.  " ' '. ' 

“As far as Rick and I are con- ’

cerned, there is a rivalry for the
starting berth on the field, b_ut not
off. Heck, the other night I was
over to his house for dinner. The

_1upkees his mother makes are

some of the best I’ve ever eaten.”
