Debate Team
,Wins Honors

ln Ohio Meet

. ’ 7;Men to Represent
 . Pitt at State College

 Scoring a startling victory by
. winning nine out of ten debates and
the extra individual honor, of the
impromptu speech contest, the
Men’s Debating association easily
won with all honors in the Great
Lakes _ debating tournament at

Berea, Ohio, last Friday and Satur-

day. 0

Defending the negative side of
the .question “Resolved: That a
permanent union of the nations of
the western hemisphere immedi-
ately be established,” Robert Sul-
livan, C43, and Edward Tablac,
BA43, swept through four out of

I ﬁve of their debates.

William Banks, C43, and Edwin
Baldridge, BA42, discussing the

‘aﬁ-lrmative side of the same ques-

tion, captured decisions in all ﬁve
of their encounters.

Banks, who was arguing against
the selective service act, won the
impromptu speech contest after go-
ing» through three eliminations.

The Pitt team, composed of three

sophomores and one junior, ‘was
expected to make only a fair show-
ing in view of the fact that the
number of mid-west schools coin-
peting had entered their varsity
upperclassmen.
' Seven other members of the de-
bating team and director Charles
W. Lomas, will travel to State Col-
lege tomorrow night to take part
in the sixth annual Pennsylvania
state debater’s legislative conven-
tion on Friday and Saturday.

Committees for the legislative
Conclave will be divided into three

«sections, all concerned. with the
foreign policy of the _United States.

William Clemmer, C43, and H01-
bert Carroll, C43, will join the
committee discussing the United
States and the world conﬂict. Irwin
Rosen, C43, and Michael DeMarco,
C43, will enter into the committee
formulating a policy in regard to
the United States and the nations
of the western hemisphere.

Harold Byer, C42, and Albert Mc-
Cardle, C42, will represent the Uni-
versity in the committee discussing
the United States and defense.

After all committeemen have met
and decided on a deﬁnite policy,
and all resolutions have been pre-

. sented,' the nominating committee
will conduct the election of the
convention president for 1941-42.

McCardle.and Byer are at present
on a debating tour of Pennsylvania
and Western Maryland and will
join their teammates in State Col-
lege on Friday. Their tour has
already taken them to Westminster,
Maryland, where they debated
Western Maryland, on the question
of union with the nations of the
Western hemisphere.

Tonight at Dickinson college in
Carlisle, Pa., and tomorrow at
Bucknell university at Lewisburg,
Pa., Byer and McCardle will debate
the teams of those schools on the
desirability of unionwith the Brit-
ish Commonwealth of Nations.

Mellon Trust to Exlvilpit Two Plaster illoptlols
0f Natiolcal Art Gallery in Commons Room

. By 1-man LANGE

Two models of the National Gal-
lery of Art——a 132 square foot mod-
el and an interior view covering 240
square feet—will be assembled in
the Commons room today.

The $15,000,000 original building,
a gift to the government by the late
Andrew W. Mellon, will be opened
formally on Monday by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt whose speech
will be broadcast from Washington.

Only model of the gallery on ex-
hibit in the country, the duplicate
structure will be set up for an in-
deﬁnite time in the Forbes street,
Bigelow boulevard corner of the
Commons room.

The model was sent to the Uni-
versity by the A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable trust to be

exhibited in the room built by
funds from Mellon.
Exterior Model

Against the Bigelow boulevard

wall of the Commons room, the ex-
terior model will be assembled. It
consists of the main building, two
corridors, two wings, and a section
of the park which surrounds the
gallery. An exact duplicate of the
original building, the model is 22
feet long and six feet wide.

The interior view of the building

will be set up in ﬁve sections to
permit spectators to see all parts
of the art gallery from the interior.

Built tothe approximate scale of
one inch to 80 feet, the interior
view will cover_ an area 35 feet
long and seven feet wide. ‘

Both exterior and interior re-
plicas are built primarily of plaster
of paris and are exact duplicates of
the original building.

The new gallery will house the
Mellon art collection and will rep-
resent the building, collection, and
an endowment, a $70,000,000 gift
to the country.

The National Gallery of Art, the
largest marble structure in the
world, will be 785 feet long—equal
to the height of the Woolworth
building in New York and will have
a total ﬂoor space of 500,000 square
feet.

Located on the Washington Mall
‘where the Pennsylvania and Con-
stitution avenues intersect, the gal-
lery will be open to the public and
will house some of the most famous
works of art in the world.

The ground floor of the building
will be used for a number of
smaller galleries, 3 library of art,
an auditorium for lectures, and the
administrative offices.

A rotunda 100 feet in diameter

and 100 feet high from floor to
dome, supported by 24 columns of
green marble will be the principal
architectural interest on the main
gallery ﬂoor.

_ Another feature of the main gal-
lery floor will be two garden courts,
one in each of the principal wings,
with plants growing around the
pool. These are to provide inter-
ludes on the tour of visitors through
the galleries.

Air Conditioning

The entire interior of the build-
ing is air conditioned for the com-
fort of the visitors and the preser-
vation of the art treasures housed
there.

Skylights will furnish natural
light for the entire main gallery.

Administered as a bureau of the
Smithsonian institute, the gallery
board of trustees is composed of the
chief justice of the Supreme court.
chairman, secretary of state, sec-
retary of the treasury, and the sec-
retary of the Smithsonian institute,

Another Viewpoint
Of Scholars’ Day

EVERY YEAR at this time, the Pitt News
runs an editorial about Scholars’ day. The gen-
eral content of this yearly editorial usually is
that today is the day on which we recognize
those students who have achieved admirable
scholastic records, those who have stuck to the
true aim of college, those who have refused to
let mere social attractions keep them from their
goal of academic proﬁciency. I

The moral of this yearly editorial is that such
students deserve high commendation for having
avoided the many pitfalls of college life, that We
should View them with awe and reverence. This
latter is, of course, only implied.

Without criticizing the authors of past edi-
torials, We would like to take another View of
Scholars’ day. We should like to know why it
is necessary to honor students for scholastic
achievement. Granted that the desire to learn
is the primary reason for coming to the Univer-
sity, why must we praise a student when he
demonstrates the . outward manifestation of
1earning—a good scholastic record? A _ I

We realize that not every student is capable
of achieving a good scholastic record. We also
see no reason for particularly praising those who
are capable. It is our belief that the A stu-
dent who makes an A is not deserving of
slaps on the back. He has the ability; if he
makes any less, he is slacking. Rather we re-
serve approval for the C student who, by work-
ing hours and hours, manages to eke out an
occasional B.

Most of the students honored at Foster hall
today will belong to the rather sizeable group
with A potentialities. A few, very few, will be B
students who made A’s by drudging. Then there
will be another group whose abilities were
strained but slightly even at the A level. Many
more students who might be honored today
won’t be, either because outside employment
deprived them of suflicient time for study or
because they just didn’t put out.

If only for those few who have done better
than might have been expected, we see Scholars’
day as desirable. Too, it provides the capable
student with a spur which drives him into ful-
ﬁlling his capabilities.

We don’t mean to detract from the actual
‘records compiled by those whose names will be
listed in the 1941 Book of Scholars. In the
abstract, they are commendable. But we feel
that a great many University men and women
-— tapped to honorary fraternities, singled
out for special recognition-—may regard their
awards as hollow honors v-Jhen they remember
how little effort was expended to get them.

sﬁng Things ' 24ml Gonfentl /Volecf . . .

Wlarlines . . .

Editor’s note: Once the News attempted to stimu-
late vocal student opinion of the world situation, espe-
cially concerning the war. A column of editorial
opinion called Warlines was started, and both student
and faculty opinions appeared therein.

Due to the increasing pressure of the world situ-
ation on America, especially the war, we again call
upon students and faculty to contribute what com-
ments they feel ﬁt for such a column.

War Aim: What ‘Will Britain:
Be Like After the Vvar?

War aims are what you want after you have won
the war you are ﬁghting to gain the things you want.

The English are ﬁghting a war. We know their
most immediate war aim-—to win that war. We want
to know what they plan for the future, what Britain
will be like when the war ends. Will Britain become
a socialist state? Will Britain turn to fascism after it
has fought a war to defeat the powers which repre-
sent fascism?

More interested than Americans in Britain's war
aims are the British people. They are anxious to re-
assure themselves that this war is in behalf of a
Britain which they will be happy and proud to live
in. So while they devote the greatest part of their
energies to the primary war aim, victory, they spend
a partof their days thinking out the problem of re-
building Great Britain.

Planning for Peace

No longer do the British people want to be faced
by the problem which arose out of the last war: a
sudden peace which had not been planned, a peace
which brought more domestic strife than the war had
brought. Careful planning would have avoided the
post-war worries of the British, but there was no plan-
ning. In the last war the British planned for but one
thing, and that was a long struggle against the Central
powers. With the collapse of the Central powers there
was a similar collapse of the British planning.

The historians tell us that this war is different. The
British are determined that this peace shall be differ-
ent. The British are not ﬁghting for the Britain of
Chamberlain, Baldwin, and Ramsay MacDonald; they
are ﬁghting for a Britain of the future. One British
editor has put it this way: “Our plan for a new Britain
is not something outside the war, or something after
the war. It is an essential part of our war aims. It
is, indeed, our most positive war aim. The new Britain
is the country we are ﬁghting for.”

W/{tat Is It?

What is this new Britain? Is it socialist? Is it
fascist? It is neither. It is the type of Britain that
you would expect the British to hope for.

The Britain of tomorrow is expected to provide a
system of schooling that will provide the fullest edu-
cation possible for every child. Britons are to be
assured enough of the right kinds of food to keep them
in good health. The medical service is to be reorgan-
ized to provide methods of promoting good health in
addition to ﬁghting disease. '

Agricultural land is to be cultivated and cared for
in order to produce the maximum amount of the best
farm products for the people of Britain. Slums must
be eliminated, and the cities must be planned for
maximum comfort and safety and beauty.

Work for All

But the ﬁrst necessity in the new Britain is work
for all.

An ambitious program is thus laid out for the
future. The men and women behind it are the leaders
of the nation in war. They are the Bevins, Morrisons,
Huxleys, and Priestleys. They have created a plan
for the Britain which is being fought for. The greatest
battles are yet to come.

Above all they have hope: the hope which is car-
rying them through this war is also expected to carry
them through their plan for peace.—W. L. Klinkenstein,
C42.

“Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” gets
a treatment by Woodie Herman that
is really Herman at his best. Cappy
Lewis‘ muted trumpet is the feature
of this one with Herman sounding
like Ray McKinley. It’s a trumpeter
caught in the draft, if that’s at all
important. On the reverse, Muriel
Lane sings “Bounce Me, Brother,
With 3. Solid Four.” Both sides are
the same touch of Herman Dixie-
land.

Many have recorded “I Hear a
Rhapsody,” but next to Charlie
Barnet’s at the top we’d place Jim-
my Dorsey’s rendition. Bob Eber-
ly’s singing is the important thing.
“Mem’ry of a Rose,” on t’other side,
is again Eberly’s show, but it’s the
kind of tune that leaves us unim-
pressed.

Victo r-Bluebird

This week’s Victor releases won’t
be much; at least, the advance cop-

ies we received weren’t. Worst of
all is “I, Yi, Y5, Y1. Yi." EVeI‘Y-
things bad about this one—the

number, band, and vocalist, get-
ting worse in that order. Anita Boy-
er, on the other hand, in “Boa Noite”
on the back is a deﬁnite improve-
ment in vocalizing.

Vaughn Monroe’s version of his
theme song, “Racing With the
Moon” is really smooth ballad stuff.
“Requestfully Yours” is corny ma-
terial, but fairly well done.

Glen Miller dishes out a bit of
propaganda in “A Little Old Church
in England.” Sounds like a lullaby
with an ulterior motive. Miller does
everything but pass the collection
plate. “When That Man is Dead
and Gone” isn’t too sharp, either.
Both tunes are Irving Berlin pro-
ducts.

an initiation dinner and dance held

s:

It might interest and hearten the
sixty per cent of our adult popula-
tion who prefer freedom to slavery
to learn from this uninhibited and

unsubsidized reporter that the to-
talitarian revolution will deﬁnitely
be stemmed before long.

I mean the sixty per cent who
honestly and eagerly exert them-
selves to establish a real and lasting
free country; who realize that this
is a possibility of a fact only when
the forces of stupidity, greed, and
ruthlessness are completely hum-
bled; who admit—albeit there is no
bond between Great Britain and
this nation—that the current gov-
ernment of Britain must win over
Naziism. These thirty-ﬁve million
Americans do not wish for a British
victory, but a German defeat.

O The Fruits-——Nazi Defeat

I predict (brave words these days,
no?) that those who are faithful to
the philosophies of Jefferson, Lin-
coln, and, of course, Christ, will
comparatively soon enjoy the fruits
of their efforts, and that day will be
the defeat of Naziism. Italian Fasc-
ism is dying by its own hands and
Japan will come to its knees within
a year when it senses the fall of its
German partner. The Soviet Union
will crumble through lack of play-
mates. Then the job of cleaning
house here will take on new im-
portance: disfranchisement of the
American Fascists will take place.

I predict the downfall of the
Nazis because Germany’s superior
production has of late been steadily
bogging down. And the loss of her
armaments during the Channel
crossing will leave the Germans
somewhat weaker than Britain in
this respect. Even if the Germans
are able to cross and establish a
few bridgeheads on the soil of John
Bull, they will eventually be dis-
lodged when British scissor German
supply-lines.

9 British Command Equals Hitler’s

The British High Command is
now the equal of Hitler’s. The Brit-
ish military strategists, aggressive,
unconventional ways have replaced
the “old line” leaders.

The German blockade is the most
serious threat to Britain that I can

see. German troops can be kept
out of Ireland only if the British
can afford to send enough men there
to repel the Germans. The blockade
can only be minimized with in-
creased speedy destroyers. This last
hinges on the rate of delivery from
the United States.

Italy, to some persons, rates a
place of consideration, but I’m not
one of them. Furthermore, I think
France will yet break its shackles
and offer some resistance, and
thereby attract some of the attack
from Britain. There is a strong
possibility that in time a British
base will be established in Spanish
Morocco, with merely the right en-
couragement from French move-
ments in North Africa. The Libyan
campaign will bear close watch.

0 The Blockade: Germany’s Notice

Another blockade—Britain’s cur-
tailment of Germany’s food and raw
materials—will eventually serve
notice to Germany that her day is
over. This is Britain’s most ef-
fective weapon. For the successful
blockade will mean a bitter short-
age of food and will also mean
that factory replacements will be
next to impossible.

British morale, even this early in
the war, is better than Germany’s—
and climbing. It’s bound to climb
with additional aid from the United
States and, later on, the decrease
of enemy air raids when the block-
ade stiﬂes German plane repairs and
production.

From here on in it’s going to be
the goose-step in reverse.

Shall We Pull
Our Punches?
Editor, the Pitt News:

If you’re watching a gang ﬁght,
either keep your nose clean, or get
in there and slug with both hands.
The policy of standing on the out-
skirts and throwing in a left jab
now and then is contrary to com-
mon sense. For this reason: it is
not well to make an enemy of one
of the opponents unless you are
ready, willing, and able to take him
on and lick him. Therefore it is
best to throw in your lot whole-
heartedly to the last drop of blood
with the opponent you favor, or else
stay so far away from the scene of
battle that you will not be consid-
ered next in the list of prospective
enemies.

0 Of Old Predictions

Last fall, just before the presi-
dential election, we predicted that
our present administrator had the
unexpressed intention of leading
the United States by thenose into

the European conﬂict. As proof of
this contention, we give you the
conscription and the proposed giv-
ing of destroyers to England, and
yet the presidential candidate said,
“No war.” From that point on, we
have ascended, step by step, toward
Mars.

Take the Lend-lease bill, for in-
stance: the “No AEF” proposal, and
the “No American convoy” proposal,
were both kicked in the stomach
hard. None the less, we have been
told that this bill is not a war meas-
ure. Perhaps John Public has been
fooled, but we have not. Lacking
such provisions it is an insult to
our intelligence to be asked to be-
lieve that we have not unoﬁicially
declared war. We did not «believe
in the passage of such a ‘bill. Ten
years from now, if we live to write
ameconomic history of this war, we
will not believe in it, but we are
Americans and it is up to us to

0 War and Escape

We are heading for war, and
under the present policy, we can-
not escape it. British ships will
come to American harbors for

equipment and repairs, Axis sub-
maries will sink them as they leave
our ports. Without a doubt some
American ships will be sunk too.
That gives us a war in the Atlan-
tic. United States has some 400
airplanes and a few ships stationed
at Singapore. Japan, who is sure
to start ﬁring on British at that
particular base, will drop some of
her shells on those American ves-
sels. There will be war in the Pa-
ciﬁc. The United States will ﬁnd
herself surrounded, without ade-
quate men or equipment . . . a
tough situation created by the Wash-
ington Rah-Rah boys.

Therefore, since the United
States has stuck its too—obtrusive
nose into this ﬁght, why not go the
limit to insure our own safety?

Chatter

by Bill lMeElwaiu

Sports Editor

 

Two Pitt teams came more or less close to winning important
—championships over the weekend, but their performances were

hardly comparable.

In both instances, the result was a surprise.

There are, however, several kinds of surprises.

The swimming team’s second place standing in the Eastern
‘Collegiate swimming association championships was the more

pleasant surprise of the two.

No one, from coach Ben Grady on

down, nursed any illusions about the title chances of the Panthers;

‘there just weren’t any.

Consequently, when a short-handed squad that had been rated
no better than a probable third edged out Franklin and Marshall
for second, 31 points to 30, there was more than a little rejoicing

inthe ranks of the Pittsburghers.

The runner-up position proved

‘that quality can sometimes beat out quantity, although the Panther’s
quantity of that quality was too small for a championship.

Track Teams Fooled

In rather marked contrast was the track team’s second in the
‘Central Collegiate championships at South Bend. There had been
a strong sentiment here, which no one bothered to hide, that a Pitt‘

‘victory in the meet was a foregone conclusion.

Unfortunately, the

Panthers made a mistake in forgetting that Notre Dame was also

I entered.

The Irish qualiﬁed nine men to the Panthers’ seven, then cap-

tured the team title by a good six points.

The margin was not

large but it was enough for a victory, and tended to put the some-

what-cocky Panthers in their place.

Even at that, the Panthers’

‘point total was their highest in the history of their participation in

‘the meet.

Once again Hap Stickel and Bill Carter contributed heavily to
the Pitt total, Stickel taking a ﬁrst in the low hurdles in spite of an
injured leg. Carter bested the ﬁeld in the 60-yard dash. The two
boys seem to take turns in winning the latter event, and by the
‘time the outdoor season rolls around, Carl Olson may be able to
count on two of the nation’s best sprinters.

Another pair of boys who have been scoring ﬁrst and second
place points throughout the indoor campaign are Doyle Rhoades

and Maurice Jessup, the steadily-improving pole vaulters.

The

boys have gone about their business with comparatively little fan-
fare, but their performances have been more than satisfactory.
Rhoades was one party to a four-way deadlock for ﬁrst in the
IC4A’s, and in the CIC’s J essup tied Dusty for ﬁrst.

Senior Dave MacDowell chalked up another disappointing
mark in the high jump. One of the East’s better jumpers for two
years, MacDowell hasn’t come close to his previous form this
season. Although he leaped six feet two inches in the 1940 CIC’s,
he managed only a ﬁve foot ten inch jump last Saturday.

Who-Dunn I t?

From the fraternity basketball league comes a contribution

to the coincidences department.

Seems that Sigma Alpha Mu’s

Lenny Dunn was playing in the recent SAM—PiKA game and one

-of the officials called a foul on him.

here,” shrieked Dunn.

He wasn’t just kidding, either.

“There’s robbery going on

When he got downstairs to

the Trees gym locker room after the game, he found all his clothes,

with the exception of his shoes and socks, stolen.

Brother Dunn

went home in a dither and a borrowed outﬁt.

Laspada Leads [Riﬂe Team
To “lit: ﬂver Neville Island

Larry Laspada kept up his ﬂam-
ing pace to lead the rifle team to
an easy victory over the Neville
island gun club at Neville island last
Friday night.

Shooting in only three positions,
Larry copped 290 out of 300 for
high score of the match. Pitt’s 1351
for the ﬁrst ﬁve men was more
than enough to defeat the islander’s
1319.

W. C. Donaldson, ace of the island
shooters, was runner up to Laspada
with 24. Two women, Adelaide Mc-

Cord and Helen Morris, placed in
their top ﬁve scores.

Haywood, Cengia, Wisegarver,
and Hines ﬁlled out Pitt’s total.
The Panthers shot with a crippled
squad as only eight men were pres-
ent. Captain Jim Townsend and
Joe Weisman, consistently high
scorer, were unable to shoot.

This match was one of a series
of tune—up shoulder to shoulder
matches preparing the riflers for
the National Intercollegiate matches
at Washington, D. C., on March 29.

Pitt Swimmers
Place Second

In ECSA Meet

Panthers Nose Out
F&M by One Point

Not even a. painful leg injury
could keep little Joe Kaule from
recording the point that gave
Pitt undisputed possession of
second place in the Eastern Col-
legiate swimming association
championships at Rutgers last Sat-
urday.

While warming up for the festiv-
ities with a series of dives, Kaule,
coming out of a full gainer, hit the
springboard. After a hurried bit
of treatment, Joe took to the boards
again, and this time scored the all-

important point with one of his
best performances of the season.

Rutgers Victorious

A favored Rutgers entry took the
Eastern crown from the Panthers
with a point total of 481/2. But the
defending champions managed to
squeeze into the runner-up spot
with 31, one point ahead of Frank-
lin and Marshall.

Only six members of the Panther
squad traveled to the ECSA meet.
But all six of the Pitt entries were
eligible for the ﬁnal heats after a
good showing in the prelims. Of
the half-dozen, only four could
compete in the swimming events
since the other two were divers.
And the quartet of swimmers ac-
counted for 26 points.

Ccsgrove Retains Title

Herb Cosgrove defended his
breaststroke title, doing the 200 in
2:34.2. His performance in that
event was one of the highlights of
the meet. Joe Orloff ﬁnished sec-
ond in the 100-yard free style, be-
hind Jerry Levin, Rutgers’ super-
swimmer.

Gus Wilde, Cosgrove, and Or-
loft took second place in the 300-
yard medley relay. Al Samson
joined the boys as they took place
position in the 400-yard free style
relay. Captain Dick Ames met his
superior in Orm McClave, defend-
ing champion of Rutgers, and took
second place in the diving matches.
Levin Wins Twice

Levin of Rutgers was the only
swimmer in the meet able to ac-

count for two ﬁrst places. Besides
winning the 100, he took top hon-

ors in the 220-yard free style race.

at 2:17.4, and was a member of the
winning 400-yard free style relay
squad.

As to the showings of the other
squads, Brooklyn college ﬁnished
fourth with 26, while Lafayette
took ﬁfth with 25. Then came NYU
with nine points, CCNY scoring 11/2,
and Carnegie Tech with one.

Bowser Prepares
For Outdoor Drills
On Practice Field

Crossing his ﬁngers and hoping
for good weather, Coach Charley
Bowser has announced spring foot-
ball drills will begin next Monday
afternoon on the practice ﬁeld.

The early outdoor practices will
be conﬁned to limbering up exer-
cises and light scrimmages to work
out stiff muscles.

Coaches Hoel, Kliskey, and Hart-
wig have been putting their charges
through mental workouts the past

' two weeks and feel conﬁdent that

the boys are ready for harder work.

Faced with a suicide schedule
next season, Bowser is expected to
take every advantage of good
weather to hold outdoor practice.

Notre Dame Overpowers Panthers

In 15th Central Track Champiohship

The University of Pittsburgh’s
track and ﬁeld squad scored the
greatest number of points any Pitt
team has ever collected in the ﬁf-
teenth annual Central Intercollegi-
ate championships last Saturday at
South Bend in the Notre Dame
ﬁeldhouse, but still ﬁnished second
to the Ramblers, who tallied 49
markers to the Panthers’ 43.

Having scored but 23 points in
last year’s meet, the Notre Dame
squad somewhat surprised the Pitt
team with their sudden improve-
ment. Then too, Hap Stickel hurt
his leg in the 60-yard dash and
Dave McDowell and Zeke Sterner
failed to live up to expectations in
the high jump and two-mile, re-
spectively.

Another factor that helped keep
the Panthers from copping the title
was the relative inferiority of the
other competitors in the ﬁeld. Mar-
quette and Michigan State ﬁnished
far down in the list and the other
eight teams were even worse. Be-
ing the host school, the Irish were
able to enter their whole squad, and
thus slip mediocre performers into
valuable fourth and ﬁfth places.

As the evening progressed, the
competition developed into a duel

between Pitt and Notre Dame. Of
the 11 events on the program the
talented Pitt stars copped four ﬁrst
places and Notre Dame ﬁve. Mar-
quette and Michigan Normal each
got one.

As mentioned previously, Stickel
hurt his leg in the trials, but hob-
bled well enough to take fourth in
the 60-yard dash and ﬁrst in the 65-
yard hurdles, the latter in the near-
record ﬁgure of 7.2 seconds. Hap’s
seven points gave him second hon-
ors in individual scoring; Ollie
Hunter, Notre Dame star from Erie,
took top honors with nine, netting
a second in the mile and second in
the two mile.

Other Pitt stars who won ﬁrst
place titles were Bill Carter, who
took Stickel’s 60-yard dash crown;
Red Jessup and Dusty Rhoades,
who shared the pole vault title with
leaps of 13 feet four inches; and
Del Anderson, who won the 880 in
1:58.-4--remarkable time for the
slow condition of the track.

The Panthers also copped three
second places. Bill Benghauser, the
husky tackle, got four points in the
shot put; Joe Newman ran the best
indoor high hurdle race of his three-
year varsity career to place second

in this event; and Larry Tregoning,
Bud Graf, Regis Larkin, and An-
derson combined to take second in
the mile relay.

Tregoning also placed in the 440,
to pick up three points, and Mc-
Dowell tied for a disappointing
fourth in the high jump to gain one
point. Sterner’s ﬁfth in the two
mile contributed the final point to
Pitt’s total of 43.

Speed
|Man of the Week

HERB COSGROVE-—A consistent
winner in the splash battles of the
Panther swimming squad, he hit the
peak of an already successful sea-
son last Saturday by taking ﬁrst
place in his breast-stroke specialty
during the ECSA championships.

A coach seldom compliments a
member of his squad too strenuous-
ly. But Ben Grady didn’t hesitate
to praise Cosgrove’s performance in
defending the crown he won last
year.

The breast-stroke champion ac-
counted for more than his share of
points in every Panther meet this
season. His staunchest supporters
are the members of the Pitt swim
team. Many of them think he is the
most valuable man on the squad.

Cosgrove is the type of swimmer
aquatic coaches dream about. He
can compete in the breast—stroke,
back-stroke, and in the 220 and 440
of the free style races and make a
good showing in every one of them.
Herb Cosgrove had certainly earned
his letter.

Dance Groups
Acquire Studio

For those curious people who
have been wondering about the
racket and hammering taking place
on the thirty-second ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, an answer has ﬁnally
been revealed by Miss Gladys Ry-
land, instructor of the modern dance
in the Physical Education depart-
ment. The walls have been plas-
tered, the ﬂoor tiled, a piano in-
stalled, and we now have a fully
equipped modern dance studio on
campus.

It is the Group studio of the
School of Applied Social Sciences,
and has been made available for
the use of the WAA Dance club
every Thursday afternooon. The
club has been scheduled to meet
from 3 until 6 o’clock on those aft-
ernoons, according to Bernice Kueh-
ner, C43, chairman of the WAA
Dance club.

Since dressing rooms have not
been installed, members of the
group will dress in the gymnasium
locker-room and will be taken up
to the thirty-second ﬂoor by a spe-
cial elevator. The group has been
preparing for a program which will
be presented in early May, similar
to the program held last year.

All students interested in the
modern dance who have not yet
joined the club are urged to attend
the scheduled meetings. As the pro-
gram is still in its beginning stage,
Miss Ryland has stated that all ap-
plicants will be accepted and given
a try-out.

“What Next in Europe?” is the
question which will be discussed
by Vera Micheles Dean, research di-
rector of the Foreign Policy asso-
ciation, at a dinner meeting of the
association tomorrow evening in
Webster Hall hotel.

The discussion will be opened by
a panel which includes Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, adviser on na-
tionality rooms.

Dinner will begin at 7 o’clock and
the speeches will start at 8:15
o’clock. All Foreign Policy asso-
ciation meetings are open to the
public.

Debaters Turn Town Meeting
Into Season’ 3 Liveliest Session

Sarcastic gags were hurled across the rostrum side by side with vital
statistics, and sharp, pointed jibes accompanied facts at Pitt Town meet-
ing last Monday, as debaters from the University and Rutgers turned
the session into the season’s most hectic discussion hour to date.

Debating the question, “Resolved:
“That the United States and the
British Commonwealth of Nations
form an immediate permanent un-
ion,” the two teams provided the
audience with Town meeting’s live-
liest session, as they accused one
another of “not even knowing what
a union was,” and “not even aiding
Britain by presenting an effective
aﬂirmative case.”

Seyler Appeals for War

William Seyler, C42, and Fred
Robie, Ed41, upholding the affirma-
tive case, represented the Univer-
sity, and Joe Barbash and George

"Ritter debated for Rutgers.

Seyler, opening the discussion,
appealed for an immediate declara-
tion of war against Germany, but
insisted that we would not be called
upon to send troops abroad. The
war declaration, he emphasized,
-was primarily to stimulate our in-
dustries to an “all-out” production
basis. He declared that the United
States was committed irrevocably
to a defeat of naziism, and that
the formation of a union with
Britain was in direct keeping with
that commitment.

In addition, Seyler held that a
union would have far-reaching
beneﬁts, in that it would be effective
in maintaining world peace follow-
ing the present conflict.

Referring to Seyler’s statement
that neither Robie nor himself be-
longed to any “bundles for Britain”
organizations, Barbash, the first
speaker for Rutgers started the ﬁre-
works when he asked, “Well, why
not?”

Barbash Answers Point

In negation of Seyler’s argu-
ments, Barbash declared that the
United States, while it was com-
mitted to a nazi defeat was not
committed to a declaration of war.
He also emphasized that it was
nothing more than “wishful think-
ing” to believe that we could de-
clare war without sending troops.

Barbash next answered Seyler’s
point about the internal production
effects of a declaration of war by
denying that speeding up defense
was dependent upon this country’s
entering the war. He declared, “A
mere declaration of war won’t make
Henry Ford start waving his little
red ﬂag around. In fact, the totali-
tarian effects that war might have
upon labor in the United States
would place us in the position of
abolishing labor unions to help us
ﬁght for democracy!”

He then pointed out that a per-
manent union was undesirable in
that it would mean a loss of sov-
ereignty for the United States, and
would create a potent “self-interest
group” rather than the protector of
peace that members of the affirma-
tive claimed it would be.

The cross questioning period, in
which Robie of Pitt and Ritter of
Rutgers cross-examined a member
of the opposition, was used to
further the above arguments; and
in addition to strengthening cases,
the debaters, as one member of the
audience put it, “took off their box-
ing gloves and reached for the brass
knuckles.”

Italian Cluh Plans

The Italians will go Irish—but
only for a. night at the regular club
party in 1217 Cathedral at 8

Lineoff Puts
‘All’ in Work

Every good publicity man
puts his heart and soul into his
work, but Harvey Lincoff.
C42. goes them all one better,
for he puts his entire body into
it.

VVhen the Pitt Ski club was
giving a beneﬁt show on Seven
Springs mountain last Sunday
for infantile Paralysis Victims:
Harvey wanted to put 011 3
stunt with all the trimmings.

But now, instead of the trim-
mings being on the act, they
are on Lincoff, for, trying to
play leap frog with a too-tall
tree,‘ Harvey ended up on the
short end with a broken arm.

Didn’t we say heart. soul.
and body? Brother, try to top
that.

Band Will Play
In McKeesport

Playing its second concert of the
present season, the Pitt Band Wlll
appear Friday night in McKees-
port. Last week’s opening concert,
played in Plum Township High
school, attracted over 500 people,
despite a heavy snowstorm.

The band will present the pro-
gram which it has been rehearsing
since the end of football season, ac-
cording to Jack Mullin, E41, man-
ager. The numbers constitute the
most varied program in band his-
tory, he said, ranging as they do,
from Bach chorales to “Goofus.”

Friday evening’s concert is the
second of some 60-odd concerts to
be presented throughout the mid-
dle Atlantic area. Playing an
average of two concerts a week
throughoutthe remainder of March
and April, the band will take a
four-day concert trip through
northern Pennsylvania in early
May, added Mullin.

Last year the band played before
over ﬁve thousand people during
its concert tour, and in Brockway,
Pa., the entire town dismissed
school, closed business, and went
en masse to the performance when
the band appeared there.

Featured in the concert is the
band’s trombone quartet, consist-
ing of Jack Anderson, C43, William
Jones, E42, Orva Lee Ice, C42, and
Charles Bradley, E42.

Local Defense
Group Outlines
Chapter Object

Problems of increasing industrial
production will be the main object
of the work of the chapter of the
Committee to Defend America by
Aiding the Allies among students
and faculty members at the Uni-
versity, it has been announced by
its organizers.

“Passage of the lend-lease bill
has put on paper the formula for
the defense of America through de-
fense of Britain. It is now the job
of this nation to step-up our in-
dustry to produce the war materials
required for use in carrying-out our
national policy,” declared William
L. Klinkenstein, C42, one of the
committee organizers.

It was pointed out by the com-
mittee’s student leaders that in-
creased production calls for sacri-
ﬁces on the part of labor, capital,
and the consumers of the nation.
The committee aims to determine
through research and personal in-
vestigation how the maximum of
production can be achieved without
any loss for labor, capital, and the
consumers that is not in proportion
to ability to bear that loss.

Plant expansion, increased work-
ing hours, and other problems of
the defense set-up will be the sub-
jects for investigation and dis-
cussion by committee members. It
is hoped, committee members de-
clare, that conferences can be ar-
ranged by the students with lead-
ers in industry and labor in West-
ern Pennsylvania.

“We will ask for statements from
the leaders of industry and labor
concerning the bottle-necks in pro-
duction and the items of conflict
which may arise in the maintenance
of an increased production sched-
ule,” Klinkenstein stated.

Local Business
Index I mprores

Bureau of Business Research an-
nounced in its monthly summary of
business conditions in the Pitts-
burgh district that the adjusted in-
dex of business declined slightly
from January to February, but av-

eraged about 27 per cent higher in
February than in the same month a
year ago. In the past three months
the index has averaged slightly
above 142 per cent of the 1923-25
average, by far the highest level in
any three-month period on record.

The volume of industrial produc-
tion was roughly 3 per cent lower
in February than in January but
more than 27 per cent greater than
in February 1940. Steel mill oper-
ations were sustained . t high levels,
and at the beginning of March the
industry in this district was work-
ing near practical capacity.

In the adjusted index of trade
from January to February, there
was an increase of about 2 per cent;
retail sales held up moderately well.
Department store sales in the ﬁrst
two months of 1941 exceeded the to-
tal in the like months of 1940 by
about 10 per cent, the Bureau stated.

called by their local draft boards or
else they will volunteer for their
year’s service instead of returning
to school in the fall.

Because of the Selective Service
act provision permitting deferment
until June 1 for all men 21 or over
enrolled in school, very few under-
graduates have already entered in-
to their year of military training.

Besides the 11 per cent above,
nearly 10 per cent are not planning
to return to school next year, but
do not believe they will be drafted;
or will volunteer. Nearly four-
ﬁfths of the students now in school
believe they will return for at least
one more year’s study. This study
should not be interpreted to mean
that college enrollments will be de-
pleted by 11 per cent. This ﬁgure
is merely an indication as to how
much the defense program is liable
to affect the college male. ’

The exact percentage, as found
by the Surveys through interviews
taken on the scores of campuses
participating in the poll, are as fol-
lows:

Will volunteer or be draft-

ed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .11.2%
Will return to college . . . . ..79.2
Will do neither . . . . . . . . . . .. 9.6

(This tabulation does not include
the 6 per cent who are undecided.)

Slightly more than a year ago, in
February, 1940, the Surveys found
81 per cent of the nation’s college
students opposed to passage of a bill
by Congress requiring every able-
bodied young man 20 years of age
to enter a year’s training in the
Army or Navy.

Exactly one year previous, 80 per‘
cent of the college men declared
they would not volunteer if the U.
S. went to war for reasons other
than the defense of the country, but
in October, 1939, only 58 per cent
said they would not volunteer if the
U. S. went to war against Germany
to protect. England and France.
