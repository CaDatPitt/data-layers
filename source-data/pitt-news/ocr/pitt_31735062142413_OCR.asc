The International Students Assembly has chosen this
day to honor the students and professors tortured and killed

in Czechoslovakia, three years

ago. On that day, November

17, 1939, there was committed the ﬁrst of a series of organiz-
ed massacres designed with calculated savagery to stamp
out all present or future leaders of a greatland democratic

republic.

In their cold fury the despoilers of Czechoslovakia for-
got that the streets of Prague and the halls of the proud
University for centuries have echoed the voices of men will-
ing to die rather than believe and teach according to pat-
terns their conscience could not accept. We know that the
earth thrown over the bodies of the martyred students and
teachers did not stiﬂe the will to liberty, and that the noise
of machine guns did not drown the voices which still demand
the right of a people to determine how it shall think and live.

These are principles which will continue to inspire the
youth of every land. They have been the dreams and pro-
jects of students through the ages, but in the victory now
to be won and the peace to be secured there is a practical
task for the young people of all countries. In their coopera-
tion they have a special mission. They must know that there
are in the world great regions where a whole generation
of young men and women have been destroyed by the rav-
ages of war or debascd by a crooked and ungodly tyranny.

From the vast reserves of courageous and enthusiastic youth.
they must replenish the intellectual vigor of stricken lands, .

and with the clear eye and the ﬁrm hand of youth they must
help create that better world toward which we strive.

Chancellor John G. Bowman has appointed the following people as

faculty members of the Student—Faculty association: Dr. Rosiland L. V

Brarming, instructor in political Science; Dr. John C. Amundsen, as-

sistant professor of history; Frank
Bromiloy, instructor in civil engi-
neering; Dr. W. George Crouch,
assistant professor of English; and
Miss Harriet Glasser, assistant to
the dean of women. Assistant dean
of men,‘ Robert L. Arthur will
serve as the chancellor-s personal
representative.

Dean of women, Helen Pool
Rush. and dean of men, Theodore
W. Biddle are also faculty mem-
bers of SFA.

These men and women will be
the deciding factor in the question
of equal fraternity and non-frater-
nity representation in SFA, which
has once again split the assembly
of the association.

After the Independent group
succeeded last Spring in adding the
Equal Representation amendment
to the SFA Constitution, it was
believed that that issue was ﬁnal-
ly closed. But in the lastmeeting
of SFA independent president Al-

do Icardi demanded that Al Minna,

C44, and Bob Burford, E43, be dis-
missed from the assembly because
they were elected as Independents
and had since pledged fraternity.

At that time it was believed that

Pete Shanta, E43, was also going ‘
to pledge fraternity. Since then it ,
has been learned that Shanta did 4'

not pledge fraternity and that he
has no intentions of doing so.
Icardi charged that they were
ineligible for membership, be-
cause they violated the Equal
Representation amendment,
which requires that the assembly
members be selected from repre-
sentative groups-—i. e., 16 from
the fraternity and 16 from the
non-fraternity groups.

The question was debated and
the assembly decided by one vote
that Minno and Burford should not
be dismussed. Among those vot-
ing were Bur-ford and Minno.

Town Meet
Talks Of _  
World W/are

This afternoon at 2:30
o'clock in 132 Cathedral "the
University will oﬂicially ob-‘
serve International students’
day—-set aside as a day of
commemoration of the 112
Czech students slaughtered
by the Nazis in 1938. .

Over one-hundred schools
and colleges in America will
observe International stu-
dents’ day this year with pro-
grams similar to the one be-
ing given this afternoon at
the University. _

President Roosevelt has sent. a
message to all schools and stu-
dents participating” in the day's

exercises. His letter is printed just V.

to the left of this story.

The program, authorized by
SFA, and sponsored by Pitt Town
meeting will be devoted to a dis-
cussion of the role students of
United Nations play in the war.

China, Brazil, the United States,
and Poland will be represented,
as students from each of these
countries will tell of the changes
brought about in their schools and
colleges because of the war.

Dr. Ralph Chang, meteorology
student at Carnegie Tech, and in-
structor in Chinese at the Uni-
versity, will tell of his native
China's transition from a peaceful
nation to one at war.

Miss Naria Vaira, of Brazil, will
tell of the contribution being made
by our major Latin-Americanally.
She is a student at Pennsylvania
College for Women.

‘Emanuel Gruss, Polish emigre,
will describe the effect of Hitlet’s
invasion upon the schools and obl-
leges of his country.

And Harold Gondelman, C44,
will tell of the part American stu-
dents have taken in the war.

Main speaker of the afternpon
will be Edward Tabor, n ted
Czech leader. A practicing a or-
ney in Pittsburgh, Mr. Tabor was
present at the signing of the
Czechoslovakconstitution 24
years ago.

From the faculty of the Univer-

sity, Dr. Carroll Amundson, assist-
ant professor of history, will speak.

‘ An able seaman, Dr. Amundsen

has traveled through most of con-
tinental Europe, Russia, North

A America and the British Isles. He

has been at the University since
1928.

Men’: Council
To Sell Stamps
Wednesday ‘

Men's council with Arthur
Clarke, E44, heading the sales del-
egation will attempt to exceed last
week’s stamp and bond sales mark
of almost $1,000 tomorrow.

Men’s council president Art
Thompson, C43, has promised that-
all twelve council members have
definitely signiﬁed their intentions
to break all records tomorrow, both
for individual and for group sales.
“It's the biggest thing since last
year's Fordham game,” said
Thompson. “You can be sure the
boys will really put forth a supe-
rior effort.

More thorough coverage of pos-
sible faculty outlets has been as-
sured, since the committee has se-
cured the services of two faculty
members who are to act a sadvis-
ers to the committee. Russell A.
Dixon, assistant professor of eco-
nomics, arid Burton H. Gilder-
sleeve, instructor in ﬁnance, re-
cently answered the committee's
pleas for more intense faculty par-
ticipation by assuring members
that maximum cooperation with
the faculty wiil be obtained.

‘ That was one-tenth of the entire Univer-

And two years ago, the day was set aside

Letters .

Editor, Pitt News:

The letter in regard to physical
conditioning signed by Icardi and
Bipp is most interesting to this
department. I-n the school year of

‘ 1940-41 it became apparent that

we would need newer schemes of
physical conditioning for our stu-
dents.

At that time a program was
“sought which would require a
minimum of expense for equip-
ment and directing personnel,
and a minimum of student time
_without too much “regimenta-
iion.” , .

A program of “A Minute A Day”
was submitted by us in March,
1941. Our program was well re-
ceived by t-he administration and
{the deans, some of_ whom ack-
nowledged receipt of its details.
'In the end it received the academic
foyebrow arch which indicates it
ean’t be done because I have never
done it.

This is no time for controver-
sies such as recently conducted

_ by one of the downtown papers

about the insuﬂiciency of Ameri-

'. jean history in the city schools.
’ ._‘I‘ha~t is another of the skills in
‘ which training and conditioning
' may be acquired in t-he sitting

in the sitting position, exclusively.

“Indoctrinaiton” used to be a
horrid word but has taken on
new signiﬁcance to those in the
esrvice ﬁghting for the preserva-
tion of our country. Our educat-
ors will be interested in three
quotations taken from the report
adopted. September 1, 1942, by
the U. S. Oﬁice of Education
Wartime Commission: “Colleges
and universities provide well
adapted programs of instruction
in health information suited to
today’s needs . . . and in the
principles of fatigue and relaxa-
tion.” “The time allotment for
physical education activities for
all students should be no less
than one hour daily.” “. . . that
the faculty give consideration
ﬁrst to health and ﬁtness, and‘
second to curricular require-
ments.”

At anytime, these suggestions
could be incorporated into a good
foundation for future activity in
training, conditioning, and appli-
cation of any skill.

We can make a good start at
10:00 a. In. every morning Each
student should take his pulse rate
before and after the exercise with-
in “A Minute A Day” to learn
something about condition. Later
we require only 100 seconds of
work daily to brin-g conditioning
close to par. The teachers of each
class could time the students.

War Books

At Carnegie Book Meeting

Recently suggested at the Book
Meeting at Carnegie Hall last
week, was a personal war reading
‘course including books from three
groups. The Alldred Room now
contains new books which fall into
these classes.

Suggested ﬁelds of reading in-
elude: books on war strategy;
books about future peace settle-
ment; books on the various theat-
ers of war.

New Alldred room additions un-
ﬁler the ﬁrst category include Han-
son W. Baldwin’s “Strategy for
Victory,” Murray Harris’ “Li'fe-
lines of Victory,” Alan Michie’s
“Retreat to Victory,” James B.
'.Restore’s “Prelude to Victory,”
deSeversky’s “Victory Through Air
Power,” and “The Coming Battle
of Germany” by William B. Ziﬂ’.

Books looking toward post-war
settlements are “Prepare for
Peace” by H. M. Wriston, “Prob-

 
   
  

“Agenda for a Post-War World”
and “The Making of Tomorrow”
by Raoul de Rousey de Sales..
Important for their discussion of
happenings in the various war
theaters are the following new
books:'John Hersey’s “Men on Ba-
taan,” Russell Hill’s “Desert War,”
Erskine Caldwell’s “All Out on the
Road to Smolensk,” W. L. White’s
“They Were Expendable,” “Queen

Editor, the Pitt News:

I cannot hope to criticize the
editorial page with a sense of in-
fallibility, nevertheless I will do
so as an uninspired reader of T-he
News.

What was the signiﬁcance of the
article about the NAM? With lit-
the subtlety I imply that there was
no signiﬁcance. Why write so many
words about a man as unimportant
and as unknown as William With-
erow? Why interview a man with
the object of turning every phrase
he utters against him.

Was this article not a thin-veil-

ed excuse for airing socialistic

opinions? Do not misunderstand
me I also profess socialistic beliefs.
However, why not write an out-
and-out editorial? Thisi combina-
tion of the editorial and the inter-
view loses its meaning i na welter
of ambiguity. Ordinarily it would
be nothing to protest about, but,
unless I have been misinformed,
there is a paper shortage.

Pitt co-eds really had something
to worry about and plenty of com-
petition when Lucille Lambert,
Miss California of,1942, showed up

that mind of hers. After dating

Sitting in a press box, game after game, and listening

"“‘ to the veteran sports scribes telling of the good old days

can become very monotonous, especially if there is nothing
else to do but watch the Panthers put on their weekly 60

minute show. ’

Many times we felt like leaving, but, fortunately, some-
thing always happened that made us glad we stayed. Take
for instance the Minnesota ﬁasco. “Primo” DiMattio’s great

run made us visualize future headlines proclaiming all-
American greatness for this youngster.

The following week we watched a devitalized Panther

 eleven spring to life and rip to shreds the Southern Methodist

«  team. At Cleveland, the ﬁnal score was irrelevant, for the

   

    

most determined squad ever to wear the Blue and Gold uni-
forms outclassed a superior Great Lakes team for three quar-
ters, giving way at last to superior numbers.

In the Stadium press box while Pitt played Indiana, Duke,
and Carnegie Tech, the writers were telling of the great days
of Hagan, Welch, Heller, Goldberg, etc. We listened during
the entire game, but at halftime sat admiringly and watched
and "heard the great Pitt band. '

In Columbus, Dutton was great. We didn’t have much
time for him though, as we were rather busy totaling up the
scores for the statistician. Last week against Nebraska, Pitt
ﬁnally won its third game. The score didn’t make us happy;
it was a dull, ho-hum affair, with both sides exchanging fre-
quent fumbles, and we knew the locals were a far better ball
club. At times there was a long pass completed or a long run
made, but not often enough to give the scoreboard man enough
work for his pay. But we were warm. We felt snug and smug,
sitting in our steam-heated press box watching the proceed-
ings. We wondered whether the players realize what a staunch
group of followers they have, sitting in the bitter, biting cold
wind, watching their exhibition of football. .

Of course, the newspapermen continued their recapitu-
lations of the good old days. Occasionally they would remark
that Dutton would be a real all-American if he were on an
undefeated team. Sure, they praised Chelko; we need more
ball players like him, they would add. He wants to play; he
enjoys tackling. That’s what makes a ball team.

Next week Pitt ends its season at Penn State. It will
be a joyous day for both the players and praise-agent, Frank
Carver. We don’t know what will happen. We rather expect
that the boys have something on their chest and will get it

 all off against the Lions. The seniors will, no doubt, want to

ﬁnish their collegiate careers with a victory, and we wouldn’t
be surprised if they do.

The sports writers will be there. They will continue
talking of the good old days regardless of the outcome. May-
be they were right. Maybe those were the good old days.

A One of the most disappointing season’s in Pitt football-

PiKA Is Annex.
IF Football

League Crown
By PAUL PALANZO

There’s a hot time in the PiKA
house these days. And why not?
They’ve just been crowned the new
king of intra-fraternity football,
succeeding the Phi Eps, and they
had no trouble in trouncing their
Phi Kappa rivals last Thursday
afternoon at the Trees ﬁeld. The
ﬁnal score was 31 to 0.

With almost the same scoring
precision as the all-Intramural
champions, the Punks of 1941, the
PiKA’s classy aggregation opened
the scoring festivities in less than
three minutes and continued to
pour it on the bewildered Phi Kaps
all through the ﬁrst half, compil-
ing a 25-0 lead. -

A Gus Wilde aerial was snag-
ged by lanky Paul Lohmeyer on
the sixteen and he scampered over.
for the ﬁrst tally. Syka’s brilliant
running brought the second score,
"ﬁnally circling the left side of the
Phi Kaps for eight yards.

Syka then passed the pigskin
to Ralph Wilde, good for twenty
yards and the third touchdown. An-
other PiKA heave, Whitey Carlson
to Lohmeyer, this time covering
thirty odd yards and the fourth
touchdown. This was the cue for
the entire PiKA scrubs to clear
the bench and do some strutting.

Although the second half pro-
duced but one touchdown, a two-
yard plunge by Syka, the game
and the title had already been iced
away for the Pikes, and they mere-
ly coasted in with the scrubs get-
ting a good workout.

Featuring the PiKA’s offense
was the superb blocking of the
Wilde brothers and Truxell, while
Dax, of the losers, was outstand-
ing for his club.

history comes.to a weary end this Saturday as the once Golden --5 2
Panthers travel down to State College to face the Lions of . --

Penn State. The game this week-end will be the 41 renewal »
of a series that started at the beginning of the century. ' «
Seven members of the Pitt team will be playing their

farewell game, and although they’re
probably sorry their college grid

careers are over, they will undoubt-

edly be glad this season of heart-
aches and bruises is ended. Bill Dut-
ton, Jack Stetler, Jim -Clowes,
George Allshouse, Frank Saksa,
Vince Antonelli and Walt West are
the players who will be wearing the
Blue and Gold for the last time.

In former years the Pitt-State
battle was just another victory for
the all-powerful Panther forces.
But, with deemphasis at Pitt and
the growth of the Lions into a ﬁrst
rate gridiron machine, the Jungle-
cats will have their claws full
again.

The Nittany gridders show a

record of five wins, one tie and one"

loss in seven games played thus far
this Ytar. The loss, inflicted by
West Virginia 24-0, was one of the
surprises of the current football
campaign. Coach Bob Higgins has
brought his forces back, -however,
since that defeat.

Following the upsetby the Moun-
taineers, State has come back to
whip Syracuse and Penn in two
games where the Lions were decid-
edly the underdog. Against Syra-
cuse, the Lions showed their spirit
and mettle as they came from be-
hind to win 18-18. Last Saturday
they came through against a high-
ly favored and more powerful Penn
eleven to win 1/3-7.

Although they notched their
third win of the season last Satur-
day against equally doemphasized
Nebraska, 6-0, the Pittmen were
still far from a good ball club.
Thoroughly outplayed through
most of the game and the recip-

ients of good breaks all afterllooll,
the Panthers have yet to Show
that they are the same outﬁt that

nearly won over Great Lakes
earlier this season.

Once again last week it was Bill
Dutton, the Weston Wildman, Wile
led the way to victory. Dutton again
demonstrated the ﬁne offen sive play
and kicking ability that stamps hire
as one of the standout backs in the
country. —

Whether Dutton will be able to
carry the load alone again tlﬁ
Saturday against State is a quot-
tion that only next week-endls
score will answer. State has a fast,

young club. Players like Bail

(Sparky) Brown, Jack Banbuly,
Bob, Davis, Wilbur VanLenten, Ken
Schoonover, John Cenci and ms]:-
man back Larry Joe give the Idols
a well balanced attack and an ade-
quate defense.

Against Penn last week it was
Schoonover who broke through to

block a Penn punt that turned into i

the Nittany’s ﬁrst touchdown.
Later in the game when Brown
was injured and had to leave the
contest, it was Larry Joe who
came in to take over and prove
hmiself an even better man the!
Brown. In four plays he covered
26 yards to score and give State
the game.

Thus Pit-t reaches the end of a
long and weary season. They
haven’t had much to smile about
throughout the long grind, .' and
Saturday's game may be just an-
other headache to add to the others
accumulated in their ﬁrst eight
games. '

Frankie Masters will present his
nawtio-nall.y—lmown 1'? piece orches-
tra and his two singers, Phyllis
Myles and Billy Lowe, at the an-
nual University ROTC military
ball at the William Penn hotel next
Friday night from 19 to 2 o'clock.
Masters - was featured several
weeks ago at the Stanley theatre
downtown, and played for the Du-
quesne Military ball last Satur-
das-

Characterized as an orchestra
with a sweet tempo, Masters gives
the brass section much solo work.
The orchestra recently completed
a six months’ engagement at the
Hotel Taft in New York. It is bet-

ter known by its broadcast over
the Blue Network each afternoon.

Approximately 150 tickets are
still available for the dance and
may be secured at 437 Cathedral,
announced Aldo Icardi, C43, pub-
licity chairman. Tickets cost $3.50
and will continue to be sold to all
students as long as the supply
lasts.

The military ball will occupy all
of the 17th floor of the William
Penn hotel and will present in ad-
dition to Frankie Masters, the or-
chestras of Bennie Cummins and
Billy Leroy. '

Corsages will not be worn at the
dance in accordance with the SFA
ruling but the committee will pre-
sent favons to all ladies at the
dance.

the demand.

No school has been more affected by the war
emergency than the School of Nursing. That is the
opinion of Ruth P. Kuhen, dean of that school, who
explains that the University has accelerated its
nursing program to meet the urgent demand for

nurses.

In the pre-war past, future nurses enrolled in
the college for two years after which they were
admitted to School of Nursing on a selective basis.
However, the declaration of war made some
speedup necessary, and the school arranged its
program to meet the demand for more college

trained nurses.

To meet the problem of young women interested
in nursing but without sufficient funds to attempt
to enter the school, certain aid has been established.

The A. W. Mellon Educational and

grant of $20,000 to the school has helped to solve
the problem in addition to Federal Aid and a grant
of $4,000 made by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.
Under the present plan nursing majors will enter
the professional school as rapidly asthey complete
their accelerated pre-nursing program. Thus vacan-
cies for teaching and supervisory positions will be

ﬁlled quickly.

“The future of the college trained nurse is a
bright one,” said Dean Ruth Kulien. “More subscrib-

units and keep’ the bulletin boards
covered with good snaps. Some
trips are screduled too;., one to a
movie projection room and one or
more to the’ art exhibits.

Reading to children in hospitals
will be a main feature of the
Speech unit, according to Ruth
Wolﬂ‘, head of the unit. This unit

will sponsor choral speaking, po-V’

etry reading, record voices before
and after the training period, prac-
tice introducing speakers, and
learn debating and discussion
methods.

The Stage-Craft unit, under
Dorothy Murphy, is going to visit
the Nixon back-stage. The light-
ing effects and stage settings, es-
pecially the difference between rit-
uals, pageants, and dramaswill be
explained to the members. This
year, however, there will be more
actual work with acting. Since the
group is using Foster Memorial,
instead of a miniature stage set-
up, they will be greatly aided in
their work. Of course, included
with these plans is costume design-
ing, stage direction and vocabu-
lary, and make-up technique.

Along the same line is Alma Fay
Spann’s Acting unit. “It is more
for the hopeful Katherine Hep-
burns than is the Stage Craft
unit,” says Miss Spann. The “ac-
tresses” plan to give a series of
plays at the Children's hospital.
and a big phaject called “Ballad
for Americans” with the assist-
ance of four other units. If the
ballad is successful, funds may be
raised through its performances.

learn the fundamentals of leading
a song group and will compose
songs. If there are instrumental-
ists among them, they’ll give little
concerts. “Pop” Finney’s records
of great music will be on hand
