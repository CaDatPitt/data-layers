dents and insects, the bill intends to remove
this potential health hazard, but some Pitt
students say that people should be able to
store couches outside at their own risk.

Pitt student Allison Crowell said though
people enjoy relaxing and smoking on
porch couches,‘ it’s a gamble keeping fur-
niture outside. I

“If you keep a couch there, there’s a
really good chance that it will get stolen

anyway,” said Crowell. “If you want to, it’s _

your decision.”

Pitt students Jennifer Mereby agreed
but said she wouldn’t want to keep uphol-
stered furniture outside because it would
get dirty.

“If I had a porch, I don’t think I’d put a
couch out there,” said Mereby.

While the issue has mainly come up in
Oakland, Kraus said the bill would cover all
areas within the city.

“That’s one of the challenges?’ he said.
“We have to come up with legislation that
will work for the whole city.”

The bill bans the storage of all uphol-
stered furniture, which it defines as furni-
ture containing ﬁlljng material and existing
for the purpose of sitting or resting on

indoors, in an unenclosed area unsheltered
from the elements.

The bill carries with it a minimum fine
of $200 and a maximum fine of $500 for
every day that the furniture remains out-
side.

Rooney's Irish luck

serves him well

Most people have to be
content with wearing green T-

. shirts and drinking green beer

on St. Patrick’s Day. Not so for

A Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan

Rooney, though. For his St. Pat-
ty’s, he was nominated to be the

 U.S. ambassador to Ireland.

“I am honored and grateful

I that such a dedicated and ac-
complished individual has agreed

to serve as the representative of

i the United States to the Irish
;people,” said President Barack
: Obama in a prepared statement

about the nomination.
At ﬁrst we weren’t sure if

i this was a legitimate news story

or some sort of St. Patrick’s Day
festivity along the lines of dying

: the White House fountains green.
i But the story is legitimate, and —

after some thought and consid-
eration — we have to agree with
the president that Rooney is a

‘A pretty good choice.

Certainly he isn’t perfect for

the position. Rooney’s age --

he’ll be 77 in July — will prob-

, ably be more hindrance than help
; to him, and the fact that he has
i no experience in international
: politics might put a damper on
f his activities as ambassador.

But Rooney does have a long

j history of promoting Irish cul-

ture and history in the United
States, as well as advocating peace

 between Ireland and the United
‘ Kingdom’s
 — he co—founded the American
‘. Ireland Fund m 1976, which the
, White House estimates has raised
f more than $300 million toward
 promoting peace in Ireland.

Northern Ireland

And given the recent escala-

I tion of violence in the region, a
-. US; presence with a history of
: promoting peace and stability

will likely be an asset.

At least one group, the Ameri— 
can Foreign Service Association, _
has opposed Rooney’s nomina—§
tion, saying that the pick is rep- I
resentative of “the decades-old;
spoils system,” which places un— f
derqualiﬁed candidates in irnpor- :

I tant positions, and that Obama?
would have done better to pick;
someone who had history with?

the Foreign Service.
But Rooney is at least as quali-

ﬁed, and perhaps more so, than ’
many of the people who have
held the position previously. This 1
list includes Richard C. Egan, an —
electrical engineer and major con— 
tributor to President George W. ,
Bush’s presidential run, and Jean 

Kennedy Smith, younger sister to
John, Robert and Ted Kennedy.
And besides,

political views line up well with

his own. The primary function:

of an ambassador is to serve as

the spokesperson for a nation,
Obama certainly wouldn’t want
someone speaking for the United 
States who didn’t agree with his i
own policies or positions. It’s§
better that he should pick some- 
one from his circle of trustedi
supporters‘, someone whom he;
knows will agree with his posi- 
tions and be able to represent:

them well.

Obama promoting class warfare

by Giles Howard
Colum/z1L1t

 

President Barack Obama might
have campaigned as an anti—war

candidate, but over the last fewit

weeks he has inaugurated a new
conflict: a class war that pits the
idle and the White House against
the productive and the prosper-
ous.

And while the cities of Iraq
and the mountains of Afghanistan

5 have proven difﬁcult enough bat-

Under those criteria, Rooney:
appears to be an ideal choice. :
People might argue that the ap- 
pointrnent is just a reward for;
Rooney’s loyal support and fund '
raising efforts, but to us it ap-;
pears-that Rooney is a genuinely 
qualiﬁed individual. And if he 
serves the country as well as he’s i
served the Steelers, we shouldn’t ,

tleﬁelds, Obama’s choice of health
care as the ﬁrst theater of this new
war is far more perilous.

The Obama administration
opened this new front early in
March by proposing to raise the
taxes of wealthy Americans to pay
for the health care of the lower.
classes. But in the last few days,
the administration has moved

‘ more aggressively to appease the
3 indigent by penalizing the produc-

t1VC.
The New York Times reported
on Saturday that, in recent hearings

‘ before Congressional committees,

both .Obarna’s budget director
and treasury secretary stated the
administration’s willingness to tax

employer—provided health beneﬁts.
This new tax revenue would then
be applied to realizing Obama’s
socialized medicine scheme.

To borrow from Obarna’s cam-
paign rhetoric, this would con—
stitute “a multi—trillion dollar tax
hike” on the productive classes of
the American workforce. Speciﬁ-
cally, Obama’s plan would increase
taxes on 177 million Americans
who receive all or part of their
health coverage from employers.

This penalizes everyone from
lawyers and doctors to unionized

 

Obama’s plan would
increase taxes on 177
million Americans who
receive all or part of their
health coverage from

employers.

steelworkers and auto manufac-
turers who, through skilled labor,
have earned health care through

their work. It would tax them for A

their competency and redistribute
the fruits of their labors to the un-
skilled and the indigent.

A president whose mantra

was change and whose slogan
was hope has now turned to the
American people and demanded
sacriﬁce. Not sacriﬁce to defeat
terrorism, not sacriﬁce to solve
the ﬁnancial crisis, not even sac-
riﬁces to repair our image abroad
but rather sacriﬁce to beneﬁt the
undeserving.

Ayn Rand wrote, “It only
stands to reason that where there’s
sacriﬁce, there’s someone collect-
ing the sacriﬁcial offerings. Where
there’s service, there’s someone
being served. The man who speaks
to you of sacriﬁce is speaking of
slaves and masters and intends to
be the master.”

What is the incentive to pro-
duce if production has no relation
to the necessities of life? What is
the incentive to work if those who
work and those who do not share
the fruits of that work equally?

Paying taxes is not a sacriﬁce
to the well-being of some sort of
American collective. Paying taxes
constitutes the buying of goods
such as defense, transportation in-
frastructure and education.

If the paying of taxes ceases
to be a capitalist exchange of one
good for another, then we have
become a new nation divorced

from the founding principles of

Market Central trays not all that bad

by Matt Diabes
Colum/11}/t

I have to preface this column
by saying that lately, as an avid en-
vironmentalist myself, I have been
very impressed by the work of my

‘fellow students whom I see time to

time in Market Central. Gloves off,
sleeves rolled up, they  through
the remains of people’s lunches
and dinners to unearth information
about just how much we’re wasting
when we don’t ﬁnish those spoon-
fuls of rice steeped in soy sauce at
the bottom of A our 360 plates or
the last bite of that massive grilled
cheese sandwich.

It is important in movements
like this to be as visible as you are
effective, to uphold an active image
that will cause awareness to spread.
However, a great problem arises
when the image outdoes that ac-
tion. Even worse is when the image
is all there is and no active change
is achieved at all. H

This is the case with the new
revolution to remove trays from
Market Central. These plastic plat-
forms, though reusable —— that is to

say, relatively environmentally con-.
scious because they are used over
and over again and are not 
up landﬁlls or incinerated and de-
pleting ozone — consume between
one-third and one—half of a gallon
of potable water per washing, and
the energy and dish detergent that
go with that
When this

prepared for you back to the table
that has been washed and cleared
for you? That gives a new meaning
to “out of touch with reality.”

But being out of touch doesn’t
even describe the dark secret behind
the tray removal process. I am not

first presented to
me, I considered
giving up the
tray. I found this

E j? set.

Let’s ignore
for a second the fact that Market
Central is probably, other than The
Perch, the most sustainable eating
facility on campus. Let’s also ignore
the fact that Strutters of Schenley
Cafe puts all of its food on poly-
styrene plates, one of the most
infamous of all commonly used
materials: It’s a toxic carcinogen
to humans, a material that bleeds
into drinks and waterways that run
around landﬁlls and one that sits

intact for about a millennium.

And we’ll ignore that every-
thing except the trays in the Ca-
thedral Cafe is plastic and one—use
only. And that students who enjoy
showing off their prowess with
chopsticks have to use disposable
wooden chopsticks, which, accord-
ing to a March 2006 piece in the
Independent, are responsible for
the destruction of 25 million fully
grown trees_annually.

Let’s ignore all of those glaring
problems that are poisoning stu-
dents, subjecting them to harmful
chemicals,  the waterways,
blackening the skies,  landﬁlls
and covering theloceans. Instead,
we’ll focus on the reusable trays
in Market Central that are washed
with less than a gallon of water
each + water probably ﬁlled with
chemicals from Schenley Cafe’s
polystyrene plates.

Of course, this could be a step

in the right direction, even if it is

badly prioritized and somewhat
misinformed. It does in fact save
water and a energy -—— although
the energy savings may be negli-
gible, considering the University/s
many 24-hour, lights-on buildings
Removing the trays could be a step

in the right direcﬁon, if it weren’t
actually all a big farce.

I asked two of the people col-
lecting the waste from students’
lunches what would be happening
to our wonderful trays now that
they are being retired. I was told
that we were retiring them, but the
trays weren’t going to be out of
commission.

Yes, the ultimate passing of
guilt. Apparently, our waste-pro-
moting trays are being sent else-
where! Thefre being sent to “other
schools” or “probably to summer
camps.” How very productive ——
let’s let them waste their water in-
stead of us.

Here’s an idea. Let’s leave the
trays alone until someone comes
up with a better idea of what to do
with them. Hey, maybe they can be

ground up and used as insulation.

for homes in a desperate neighbor-
hood. Maybe they can be the new-
est fashion craze. Meanwhile, I’ll
be putting my food from Strutters
on a reusable tray in place of the
disposable, poisonous polystyrene
plate.

No hope or change for those being robbed by taxes

this country.

James Madison wrote, “Charity
is no part of the legislative duty of
the government.”

Obama was not elected to turn
the United States into some sort
of Salvation Army where giving to
the indigent is mandatory. In fact,
many of those 177 million Ameri-
cans who receive health insurance
from their employers voted for

Obama because they correctly rec-
ognized Sen. John McCain’s plan
to tax their beneﬁts as an undue
intrusion of the government into
their ﬁnancial well—being.

But at least McCain intended
to give that money back to Ameri-
cans through tax credits.

In short, Obama has consis-
tently reneged on his campaign
promises and become a poor

caricature of the very people and
policies he opposed. He should re-
member that it was the upper and
upper—middle classes that bank-
rolled his campaign and catapulted
him from the underdog position
in the primary into the presidency.

He should also keep in mind
the fact that the unions who

i bro ht the ass-roots muscles
“S 8‘

to bear kept him from being a

footnote in U.S. politics. Betraying
both labor unions and the upper
class in one fell swoop guarantees
he will be relegated to one term.

Iraq and Afghanistan have
become quagmires in which the
United States seems stuck for
decades. Both conflicts appear
intractable, and each promises to
cost this nation dearly before they
are over. '

However, Obama’s third war,
the one against the productive
classes, will make those foreign
adventures appear like cakewalks
—— unless he quickly changes his
tune and abandons his socialist
pretensions.

This nation elected a leader in
November of 2008, not a master.

Pittsburgh Ballet Company dancers use their classic ballet training

to dance to popular contemporary music.

‘American Rhythms performs to a new beat

Ballet to the Sounds of Springsteen

by Natalie Bell
Staﬂ WrL'ter

American Rhythms

March 19 to Q2
Byham Theater

The Pittsburgh Ballet Company
will bring some spring to the steps
of ballet with live doo—wop music
and the songs of Cole Porter and
The Boss.

The Company will dance its way

through a three—ballet extravaganza .

this weekend at the Byham The-
ater.

“This is the kind of show that
would attract a younger audience,”
said  Erikson, a dancer in all
three shows.

“American Rhythms” is a toe-
tapping blend of three ballets
danced to the music of Porter,
Bruce Springsteen and doo—wop.

“It’s a contemporary vocabulary
that only ballet dancers really can
do. So you have the aesthetics of a
physical ballet dancer and then do-

’  rhythms and movements that

are atypical for a ballet dancer,” said
Terry Orr, artistic director for the

entire show.

The show starts with Porter’s
“Anything Goes.” The ballet elicits
nostalgia of the enchanting and by-
gone era of Hollywood in the ’30s
and ’40s.

“It’s really light and fun, and the
music is great,” said Robert Moore,
a dancer in all the ballets.

“You take on this air of sophis-
tication and the style of that day,”
said Erikson.

It certainly won’t be the very
classic dancing and musical images
that pop into peo-

steen’s music. The Boss’ gravelly
voice underscores the duets and
scenes that act as snapshots in the
lives of several different people.
This ballet has a more melancholy
feel, exploring the difﬁculties and
complexities of love.

Each of the eight couples por-
trays a different story taken from
the words of Springsteen’s songs
through their dancing. One pair,
who die in a car wreck, reminisce
about their lives together. In an-
other dance, a very insecure man is
constantly para-

Zack Snyder talks Watchmen, celebrities and politics

by Noah Levinson
Staff W/riter

It’s hard not to notice that little
yellow smiley face pin with a drop
of blood on it. The icon’s been
splattered on television ads, post-
ers and billboards to advertise the
new movie “Watchmen.” But the
largest smiley face belongs to the
ﬁlm’s director, Zack Snyder.

Snyder, whose other films
include a “Dawn of the Dead”
remake and the action sensation
“300,” spent the past 3 years creat-
ing “Watchmen.”

The film is an adaptation of
a 1987 graphic novel written by

Alan Moore, author of “V for
Vendetta” and “The League of
Extraordinary Gentlemen.”

“I’m a giant fan of Alan
Moore,” said Snyder in a press
conference call. “The first ques-
tion I asked was, ‘When do we get
to go talk to Alan Moore?” But
the answer was never.

Moore decided that, like his
other works transferred to the big
screen, he wouldn’t support the
ﬁlm adaptation.

Even without Moore’s support,
Snyder knew he was destined to
take on “Watchmen.” He couldn’t
imagine it forming any other way.

“If I didn’t do it, it was going

Additional evidence that

Google is slowly taking over the
world can be found in a Google
service called Google Voice. l

The new service,- originally
an independent company called
GrandCentral, allows people who
normally switch between mul-
tiple telephone service providers
to easily manage their livesiwith
one. . i

The situation can be rather
grave. Suppose your apartment
has a landline telephone, but you
spend most of your time sitting
in traffic. When in traffic, you can
only be reached using your cellular
telephone -— reachable with a dif-
ferent number that not everyone

knows. You also have an office"

landline phone and commonly
have to give contractors and your
mechanic your work number. '
Normally, someone who wants
to be guaranteed to reach you will
need to know all three numbers

 

Google oice: further

. and will have to try each.

GrandCentral’s original solu-
tion to this problem was to com‘-
bine all of your 'numbers.iMem—
bers are assigned one number that
rings all three telephones simulta-
neously. T ' '. _

Because the system is intercon-
nected, calls already in progiress
can even be transferred between

You may think,- “Fine, but I .carriers and telephone lines, using

only have two phones, and I am
perfectly capable of managing

them myself.” But Google Voice’s _

proposed features go far beyond
the integration of multiple com-
munication media.‘ Google Voice

Google got its

hands on GrandCentral, it began .

making its normal alterations, giv-
ing it a better look and feel and
more integration to user’s exist-
ing Google infrastructures. When

. Google Voice becomes available

to non—GrandCentral customers,
it will ‘be able to fully integrate
with Gmail and, more important-

ing e-mail.
The entire idea is to provide an

‘ online hub for your voice commu-

nications. While before your voice
communications could be spread
across multitudes of providers

. that are not compatible with on_e

another, Google Voice provides
the capabilities to receive voice
mail, text messages and telephone

a single user interface. That single
user interface is integrated, with
other Google services.

Google Voice __provides the
functionality to record telephone
calls for future reference, storing
them online ‘and making them

' available through the Google

Voice user interface. Google has
even gone so far as recreating
some services of the telephone
company, including directory as-
sistance — 411‘ -— and mobile Inter-
net. , . V '
Even conference calling is pro-
vided - and everything for free.‘ .
The service is not perfect.

' Apart from the fact that right

now only previously ensconced
GrandCent::al customers have ac-
cess, the system is ‘vulnerable to
all the problems inherent in digi-
 analog voice signals.
Transferring spoken voice

mail messages -— especially voice a

mail messages left by callers using
a cellular telephone — might prove
to be uliimately too inaccurate to
be useful. Callers with speech im-

pediments,’ those who speak too
quickly or those callers who use

odd vernacular might trick the .

system into leaving ‘text versions
that are nonsensical.

It is also somewhat question-
able whether storing your voice
communications for long amount
of times on a public server is a

good idea. If you have too much '

of your life on Google, ultimately,
you may get burned if Google is
attacked. '
Google Voice sounds quite
promising for business, however,

as it provides extensive function- _

ality for busy employees to keep
track of communication and per-
form critical, collaborative cor-
porate tasks like conferenceicall
meetings. .
Still  maybe it won’t be a
good idearto check your Google

_e-mail. using Google 'Voice on
your cell phone running Google

Android while you write a paper
on Google Docs after taking a
procrastination break to look up
potentially pornographic words
on Google Images. Too much

to be a basic PG=13 movie with sequel po-
tcntial,” said Snyder.

Deciding to use loW—kcy actors ‘instead of
Hollywood stars also separated Snyder from
the other possible directors who could’Vc
taken the project. .

Without major celebrities, Snyder be-

" licved that the characters woulditruly be-
, M come characters and not_actors playing char--'

acters. Instead of “Thcre’s Rorschach,” one.

A of the main characters of the ﬁlm, people

might say, “Oh, look. Therc’s Brad Pitt play- _
ing‘Rorschach.” ' ‘
“My actors don’t play the Hollyyvoo

Ag:;.mc,” said Snyder. ' '

‘Most importantly to Snyder, the cast

matched the ‘physical appearances of the -‘

.novel’s characters, especially in the case. of‘
the mostly naked, blue superhuman, Dr.

‘Manhattan. . S’ ' -

“The most difficult character to realize
is Dr. Manhattan, but in some ways one of
the most reyvarding characters,” said Snyder.
“Dr. Manhattan is aisuper emotional charac-

‘ ter. Hc’s ‘aidark and sad god.” _ _ h
, Dr. Manhattan is played by Billy Crudup,

seen in ﬁlms like “Sleepers,” “Almost Fa—

mous” and “Big Fish”. Crudup had to work '
with a mixture of computer graphic effects '

and motion capture technology "to create the
blue superman. ‘

Special effects aside, “Watchmen” is‘
complicated enough as‘ it is. It touches on_

a slew of issucs,-including’ civil obedience,

‘ government control and religion.
“Who polices the police? Who governs-

the government? Who gods God? Who
watches the Watchmen?” said Snyder.

\While there’s no denying the

already,a little sickening. t
It hasn’t started yet andalread

Jay Bilas’ once silky—s0unding voice _

has become so monotonous, he

-cartoon. Alas, there is another tour- '

nament currently going on that’s a

that one is about as interesting as °
' a recording of "Bilas reading vanity

That tournament is the World

Baseball Classic. For those not '

aware, the WBC is an international
competition that was created in
2006. This year is the second ever’
WBC, and from here on out it
goes to every four years. But re-
allygare, people going'to want this
tournament anymore in four years?

. Doubtful. '

There are -toris of problems with

 

some changes

the tournament As someone who’s
watched minutes —- minutes! — of
the WBC, I think I canhelp solve
some of the tournament’s biggest
issues to make it the greatest sport-
ing. event in the universe.

One_issue that comes up a lot
is" when to start Right now it’s in
the spring,  into  
training. Some think they should do

. it after the season ends in Novem-

ber and play it in warm climate
While some talk" about start date
as an issue of the tournament, it
doesn’t really matter. If the content
is boring, you could start it any day

_ of the year and it’s not going to be

compelling. And boring content is
the WBC’s biggest problem..

The WBC needs rivalries. The
first round“ was broken ‘up into
four pools containing four teams,
and the top two teams  each pool

moved on to the second round.‘

Look at Pool C, which consisted of .

Ptiflhhing
keeping
Pitt alive

by Lauren Kirsehman

S tzzff Writer

The Pitt softball pitching squad
gave up no more than ﬁve runs in a
game this season. Those ﬁve runs,
which came in a loss to UNC—Char—
lotte, took 12  for the opposing
team ‘[0 earn.

And even though Pitt (9—9) hasn’t
been completely consistent’ with the
bat, that type of pitching and defense
continues to help the Panthers stay in
games

“\X/e’ve pitched exceptionally well
and played defense very well for the
most part,” said ﬁrst—year Pitt coach
Holly Aprile “\X/e’ve been in every
game that we’ve played and never had
to overcome some huge deﬁcit”

Three pitchers, Cory Berliner,
Kayla Zingler and Alyssa O’Connell,

it gets, but Canada is more like the
Gayle to the United States’ Oprah,
whereas sports needs Canada to be
the Shelbyville to the United States’
Springﬁeld. In Pool B you do get
the Dominican Republic and Puer-
to Rico, and in Pool A, Japan played
China. Those were good, but the

whole tournament needs to be like
that.

Would you honestly give up
a chance to see the United States
play Iraq or Afghanistan? No way!
I need to make sure to cancel any-
thing I have planned so I can stay
home and watch that. Even Jay Bi—

las can’t kill the excitement of that
tournament.

Rivalries are the ﬁrst step to
ﬁxing this thing. Now, a lot of
those teams I mentioned probably
couldn’t ﬁeld an entire baseball ros-
ter. No problem! If it’s a down year
for multiple countiies in terms of
talent, throwback year. A team com-
posed of talent from Britain, the
United States and France takes on
a team of players from Germany,
Japan and Italy in a seven—game se-
ries. That’s right, Allies vs. Axis once
again, and teams will of course play
in World War II-era garb to further
enhance the fun.

Another concern about the
WBC is pitchers. The pitchers have
to leave spring training early to play
in the WBC, and they’re not fully
stretched out yet The solution?
Pitchers won’t pitch. \X/e’ll use tees.
The pitcher can choose where to
set up the tee, then stand on the
mound to ﬁeld, but that’s it.

Outside of pride, there re-
ally doesn’t seem to be 
the winner gets from winning the
WBC. And pride is nice and all,

but stuff is better. That’s why the
WBC needs mayor bets, which are
bets commonly made between the
mayors of the two teams playing
in whatever sport’s championship.
They usually comprise of 

away that city’s signature food item?

or being forced to wear clothing
from the other city.

This is an international competi-
tion, which means mayor bets could
be  Italy could iisk 
up the Leaning Tower of Pisa to
Australia if it loses, but if the Auss-
ies lose, they have to fork over the
Sydney Opera House. How about
the United States vs. Canada for
complete ownership of Niagara

Falls? Or the Dominican Republic"

vs. Venezuela with the winner get-
ting to rewrite the other count:ry’s
laws?

These were just some quick ideas
on how to improve the tournament
The WBC need not take my advice,
although I think it’s all great Just
know, if something doesn’t change,
the WBC has as much chance of
being entertaining as jay Bilas an-
nouncing a spring training game

With Visram out, Pitt moved Christie

Pitt coach George Dieffenbach said that with

fore her injury, and bumping everyone down a
spot has brought about more difficulties No de-
cision has been made about whether Visram will

Pitt lost 5-1 in singles to Nova Southeastern,
Benic was the only player to win,  Monica

O’Connell is 4-1 with an ERA of 1.17. If these
ERAS could translate to the major leagues, all
three would have multi-million—d,olla.r contracts

Earlier this season, Bediner pitched a one-
hitter against George \Washington. She gave up
the single hitin the sixthinningandwalkedone
batter.

Aptjle said that since the pitching is there, the
Panthers need to work on their play offensively to
give the defense a little support

“We just need to come around a little more
offensivelyz” said Aprile. “We are looking for our
bats to come alive a little bit as we move into the
second half of the season”

Aprile commended freshman second base-
men Kristen Cheesebrew for her offensive abili-
ties, aswell as herplayin the field

“She had a really good tournament in Char-

. lotte. She’s been great at the plate and in the ﬁeld,’ ’

said Aptile.

Cheesebrew’s batting average is .267. Third
basemen Ciera Damon leads the team, batting
.289.

The Panthers last played in Charlotte, where
they dropped a double header to UNC—Char-
lotte. O’Connell’s first and only loss of the sea-
son came ir1 the second game, when the Panthers
fell in the 12—inning contest; Cheesebrew hit two
home runs in the loss, becoming just the seven

The Winthrop Invitational, set to take place
over spring break ir1 South Carolina, was rained

As for the rest of the season, Apﬁle said the
Panthers are  to stay in the moment.

“W/ehaveagerieralgoalofgettirigl percent

or  a step in the wrong direction,” said
Aptile.

However, the Panthers start Big East play
on March 20, and Aprile said one of the team’s
broader goals is to  for the Big East tourna-
ment in May. Last season, Pitt was the No. 7 seed
in the tournament and fell hi the first round.

Fans get one more shot

communications, the team expects ticket
sales to increase each year as the team
progresses. A

i'“Our success in selling seasontick-
ets and selling out games have naturally
limited the number of tickets available to
the student rush program this year,” said
McMillan. I

The Penguins student rush program
has been in existence since 1996 and was
the ﬁrst team in the NHL to institute a
program like it to boost ticket sales. Back
then, nearly 3,000 tickets were available
to students for every home game.

But before this season started, the
Penguins announced they would offer
only four student rush program games
spread throughout the 2008 season.

The Penguins front office chose the
four weekday games expected to carry
the lowest attendance. 0

In 2006, the Penguins offered between
500 and 1,000 student rush tickets to ev-
ery home game. A year later, the number
of student rush tickets available dropped
to about 200 for every home game.

The team’s appearance in the 2007
Stanley Cup Finals caused fans to pur-
chase season ticket packages at an even
more feverish pace, and rush tickets
plummeted to an all-time low. This sea-
son, the Penguins are offering only 600
student rush tickets to each of the four
games.

That equals 2,400 student rush tickets
for the‘ entire year, compared to the near-
ly 3,000 available for each game when the
program began.

“There is certainly a supply-and-
demand element to the program from
year to year,” said McMillan. “It is not
like several years ago, when we had sev-
eral thousand seats of inventory every
night.”

But students who are fortunate
enough to get a ticket feel like they’re
getting more than they’re paying for.

“You can’t beat the deal for 20 bucks
and get to sit in section C,” said Pitt stu-
dent Jason Schwart-z, standing in line be-
fore a Jan. 20 game against the Carolina
Hurricanes. “It’s like having an $85-off
coupon, and you get to watch the best
team in hockey.”

Schwartz waits’ in line for roughly four
hours when student rush tickets are avail-
able. But that is nothing new for him.

“I have waited in line before for con-
certs, Playstation 3 and Nintendo \Wii,’’

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

he said. “I guess I got used to waiting in
line, and it doesn’t bother me at all.”
The last chance for students to get
a discounted ticket will be this month,
which is two months after the previous
student rush game was offered. Fans can
wait in line before the Penguins host the
Los Angeles Kings Friday at 7:30 p.m.
