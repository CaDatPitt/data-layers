Princeton dean calls for more
human social research tests

By Christine Hanna
News Assistant

The need for social sciences to stop testing in
the lab and start collecting research in everyday
society was discussed at yesterday’s academic
symposia held in honor of Pitt PresidentJ. Dennis
O’Connor’s installation this Friday.

Donald Stokes, dean of the Woodrow Wilson
School at Princeton University, was the guest
speaker. The board of panelists was comprised of
Pitt’s Dean of the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs Davis Bobrow; Pitt history
Professor Emeritus Sam Hays;
chairperson of the anthropology department
Professor Jeremy Sabloff; Carnegie Mellon
psychology and computer—science Professor
Herbert Simon and the chair of Pitt’s economics
department, Professor Kevin Sontheimer. The

lecturewas moderated by Dean David Epperson
of Pitt’s School of Social Work.

In his speech, Stokes emphasized the need for
the combination of basic and applied research.

“There will be and should be an intensification
of work in social sciences,” Stokes said.

Simon said he agreed the need exists. He said
psychologists used‘ to study learning processes
mainly through rats, never dirtying their hands by
applying their knowledge to people.

“In fact, the best problems for basic research
come from applied situations,” Simon said. “The
social sciences are concerned with the behavior
of human beings; we live among human beings.”

According to Simon, evaluation of current world
problems can show social scientists basic human
issues.

Sontheimer said he agreed with this theory.

News Assistant

The positive benefits of the Negro
Educational Emergency Drive have been
documented in a study conducted by Pitt
Professor Hide Yamatani.

NEED, a non—profit organization, assists
students with financial aid and counseling.
It usually is the last step for students who
seek advice to decide if they should finish
college or drop out.

“NEED recipients are long on motivation
but short on funds. They need financial
help to remain in school. This impact

of NEED Herman Reid said.

“NEED alumni are your typical African-
American students, with one exception.
They have been given the necessary
ﬁnancial backing to fulfill their educational
goals. This study shows that investing in
African—American youth pays off in ways
many of us can't even imagine,” Reid said.

The study showed that financial and
voluntary contributions from the alumni
have far exceeded the original program’s
investment of $7 million.

According to Yamatani, NEED alumni
contributed $131.4 million to society in
1990, approximately $91 million in taxes
and $40.4 million in financial and voluntary

Not assuring Israel a loan guarantee
violates the moral fiber of America, a
speaker from the UnitedJewish Federation
told B’nai B’rith Hillel members last night
in the William Pitt Union.

“We’ve left the humanitarian arena and
entered the upheaved political arena,”
said Dan Klionsky, chair of the

' communications committee for the United

Jewish Federation.

The meeting was supposed to be an
informative session about recent emigres
in Israel, but due to national debate over
loan guarantees Klionsky was invited to
speak, Cindy Goodman—Leib, assistant
director and advisor to Hillel, said.

The recent debate was apparent
yesterday when Secretary of State Jim

StAR delays distribution of racism questionnaire until./Marcia

By Alissa Smith»
Stat)" Writer

Students Against Racism is
postponing the distribution of its
18—question’ survey on
discrimination until after Spring
Break.

President Joe Babinsack said
students may not spend as much
time on the survey due to the
added anxiety and excitement

occurring before break.

. He said that most students get
hit with a lot of tests that week
and won't take time to fill out the
questionnaire. “I’ve put too much
into this for that to happen,”
Babinsack said.

Tables will be set up for the
questionnaire ’s distribution March
16 through 20 from noon to S
p.m. in the Towers" lobby, the
William Pitt Union and Forbes

Quad. '

The group will place several
decorated boxes throughout
campus for students to drop off
any surveys not immediately
completed.

Buttons displaying the StAR
logo will be given to individuals
who participate in the survey and
contribute a donation.

StAR will hold an open forum
to reveal results on March 26, in

the union’s Ball Room. Members
will compile the answered surveys
daily throughout the week of
distribution in order to combat
the time problems caused by the
postponement.

The 11 members who met last
night discussed ways to obtain
the most unbiased results, which
are unlikely to be derived with
just a few tables across campus.
StAR will work for a greater

diversity by circulating the
questionnaire among student
groups throughout campus.

The organization discussed
hopes to meet with resident
directors and have questionnaires
delivered to every dormitory floor,
but a StAR member said the Office
of Residence Life told her that if
this was done for StAR it would
have to be done for every group
conducting a survey.

Health services help students cope with alcohol abuse

By Ethan Lott
For The Pitt News

Many college students may joke
with their friends about a late
night of heavy drinking, but few
joke about potential alcohol
problems.

According to Jeremiah
McAuliffe, Pitt’s substance-abuse
prevention specialist, statistics
show that 87 percent of college
students say they drink, and 10
percent of all people who drink
develop alcohol-dependency
problems.

For college students the legal
or illegal use of alcohol can lead
to various problems, ranging from
cutting classes, which causes
deteriorating grade-point
averages, to personal injuries and
alcohol dependency.

A Pitt campus survey in 1991
found that 36 percent of those
surveyed said they have skipped
a class after a night of drinking
and 21 percent said they have
had memory lapses when drunk

or high.
But only 6 percent worried
about whether or not they might

have a drug or alcohol
problem.
According to McAuliffe,

negative consequences caused
by drinking indicate an alcohol
problem.

McAuliffe is in charge of Pitt’s
Personal Education, Assessment
and Referral Program, which is
part of the policy governing
residence halls.

Students who violate alcohol
policies are offered a choice of
paying a fine or taking part in the
PEAR.

Unfortunately, McAuliffe said
only students who get caught
receive alcohol education, and
many students that have or will
soon have major problems can't
be reached. The solution,
McAuliffe said, is friends.

“Hopefully a friend will tell
someone when they have a
problem," McAuliffe said. “A
problem is reactions. When you

I--STUDENT
GIVERNMENT

Student Government Board

ATTENTION:

say, ‘Boy, you were wasted last
night,’ it doesn’t address any of
the negatives. We need to give
friends permission to express
concern. If a friend actually says
something, you probably have
a problem because the sub-
ject is so difficult to bring it
up.”

Bridget Guernsey, assistant
director of student activities, is
the only Pitt administrator to have
gone through PEAR to learn more
about the subject of substance
abuse.

“I thought I knew a lot, but I
still learned,” she said.

“I think this program is
important for college students
because this is where a lot of
people’s drinking behaviors are
developed, and I don't think high
school teaches about psychology
and depen-dency. It teaches the
weight/drinks per hour chart, but
that’s about it.”

McAuliffe said the chart
Guernsey referred to is not
considered accurate anymore

because alcohol reacts differently
with an individual’s unique
makeup and the charts can be
off by as much as 200
percent.

Both Guernsey and McAuliffe
said they are hoping to implement
a program like PEAR for
Greeks called GEAR, Greek
Education, Assessment and
Referral.

Like the PEAR program, GEAR
would be more than just alcohol
education. ,

“We get into related areas, like
stress management and dealing
with personal traumas,” McAuliffe
said.

McAuliffe said PEAR is available
to anyone interested in being
educated about alcohol and its
effects.

The PEAR program consists of
three 90-minute classes and one
personal meeting with McAuliffe,
and anyone can participate in the
program by contac"tin'g‘McAuliffe
through the Health Education
Office.

For English proﬁ drdmd exceeds beyond the classroom

By Scott Nespor
Stajf Writer

In high school, Pitt English Professor
Susan Harris Smith was usually cast for
male roles in plays. But she said she is not
disappointed that she never had the chance
to play a glamorous role, and drama
remains a driving force in her life.

Smith said she is drawn to drama because,
“It is the most challenging and interesting
of the art forms. It is one of the few that
can’t be commodified. Drama is not like a
painting that can have a price tag put on
it.”

Smith’s interest in drama exceed beyond
the classroom. She described her life as
being intertwined in a “drama
triangulation.” In other words, Smith is
involved in drama as a playwright, a critic
and a scholar. This is why she said she
sees the world in dramatic terms.

Her work at Pitt involves teaching English
literature courses that have a dramatic
twist. This semester, she is teaching one of
her favorite courses, Dramatizing American
Women. The focus of the class is to
explore the different ways women are
portrayed by the American media and
culture. The course begins by examining
how women feel about the Miss America
pageant. Next it analyzes the various ways
that women are portrayed in drama, such
as a housewife, lesbian and the member of

a minority ethnic group.

“What can we do on stage to forgo the
issues?” and “How can feminism be realized
as not only a white, heterosexual, middle-
class movement?” are some of the questions
that Smith’s students face.

The course looks at the portrayal of the
strides that women take to reach what the
ideal woman is. Some of the movies and
plays involve anorexia and neurosis. It

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News

ends with the issues of feminist theory and
a look at “the tension thatwe face to be the
idealized woman,” she said.

Overall, the course deals with “women
and what is cultural and the real women's
culture.”

Smith has reviewed books and plays for
The Pittsburgh Press and has written 19
plays. She has even had the chance to
direct a play. While in China as part of the

Shanghai Foreign Languages Institute,
Smith directed William Shakespeare's A
Midsummer Nz'gbt’s Dream.

Smith’s year—long stay in China was part
of a program to help establish a graduate
study in communist China after it opened
its doors to foreigners.

“It was like entering a time warp,” Smith
said ofthe conditions in China. “It was like
the ’S0s froze.”

Six months prior to her arrival, China
had released many of the members of the
worker/peasant/student class from the
prisons in which they were held» for
opposing the government. These were

the first of China’s graduate students, and 2

they had no one to teach them.

Smith and her colleagues found the task
of teaching the students, “who were the
cream ofChinese intelligence,” enormously
challenging.

She likened her Chinese students’.
problem to an imagined situation, such as
“someone snatching a student from Pitt
and taking him or her away from the
university, and 15 years later told that
person that he or she was going to be an
English teacher.” Most of the students had
to be retaught.

Smith said she likes to work as a part of
a team. One of her favorite teammates is
her husband, Philip Smith. He is the chair
of the English department at Pitt. She first

Although President J. Dennis O’Connor has been
harshly criticized for excessive office spending, the,
week-long coronation, permitting discrimination to rerriain
unchecked and potential road trips to tropical islands, the
time has come for some constructive commentary.

As we know, the university is reaching a boiling point.
In the 19905, viciousness is rampant.

Attacks on O'Connor come from all fronts. Politicians,
administrators, educators and the rank and file battle for
the sheer sake of tasting blood. It’s not a pretty picture for
college life.

since President O’Connor took control. The past two,
three or maybe even five years on autopilot put the
university in a dismal situation. .

Finally, President O’(Ionnor’s No. 1 priority must be to
take affirmative steps addressing multicultural issues at
the university. Proactiveness is lacking at Pitt; affirmative
action does not imply waiting around for a crisis to
explode in someone’s face and then trying to mop up the
mess. ""' “"""' '  

Racial tension on campus is real. Anti—gay harassment
is real. Sexual harassment plagues women and even men
on campus. From the examples of other universities, we
can foresee problems. In our own backyard, the same
ones exist. A concerted effort by the university head to
assess the needs of disparaged individuals is long overdue.
When people are hurt, anger is sustained.

Leadership must come from the top of the university to
address these issues:

race. I do not need to be African-
American to hear, enjoy,
understand or critique rap music.
Rap musicians do not intend to
have their music understood and
appreciated by a single culture,
but all cultures. No musical form
contains itself to one group or
one culture. Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart was a German composer
who wrote the majority of his
operas in Italian. In keeping with
the thinking of race-dependent
music appreciation, who, then,
should write a musical review of
a performance of Mozart's opera,

- Don Giovanni? A German? An

Italian?

The idea of race-dependent
appreciation of rap music is
absurd. The introduction of rap
music into mainstream American
cultu re, specifically white, middle-

would not want to limit their
buying audience to the people of
one culture. It’s not only African-
American listeners who are
buying rap albums by the millions.
So if rap music was intended for
only one culture, millions of
people didn't get the message.

Rap musicians who are not
African-American confront the
claim that rap music was intended
for the ears of only one culture.
For example, The Beastie Boys
are a rap group comprised of
Jewish-Americans, yet they
definitely, sing rap music. I
suppose their rap is only intended
for members of the Jewish-
American culture. (Oops, I own
their albums, and I'm notjewish.)
Now things are beginning to get
complicated in the world of rap-
music reviews.

In keeping with the previous
suggestion, publishers of reviews
will have to keep several rap
reviewers on hand. An African-
American will be needed to

handle the bulk of the rap reviews. '

Then they’ll need the “specialists”
to cover the tricky reviews, like a
Jewish-American just in case The
Beastie Boys ever do release their
third album. A white liaison writer
could handle a special section for
those uninformed white listeners
who didn't realize they were not
part of the supposedly intended
audience when they bought their
copies of “black” rap.

blacks. They are members of
different cultures, after all.
Howard Cosell would have never
interviewed Mohammad Ali.
Arsenio Hall would have never
been seen on prime—time
television. Connie Chung would
be out of a job; an oriental couldn’t
relate to the culture of mainstream
America. Cable television would
be organized by cultural
backgrounds. Remote—control
wars would reach a new level.
We'd hear things like, ‘‘You’re
always watching the Italian

channel for a while.” _It seems
ridiculous because it is ridiculous,
but the close—minded, “blinders
on” mentality behind the
exaggeration is very serious.

In a time when so many diverse
groups, including Pitt student
groups, are crying out for
awareness of different cultures,
members of these diverse groups

Americans not uncomfortable with laziness, inefficency

Word to the Japanese: Our society is inefficient, and we
like it that way. Mind your own people, who are so bent
on success that their lives lose all enjoyment. We can take
care of ourselves.

Efficiency is an important value for all individuals in all
societies. Getting things done quickly and doing them
well are common goals.

However if all elements of American society were
designed for efﬁciency, our quality of life would decrease.
Essential parts of America are inefficient, and that is very
good.

One of the central points for observers of the American
crirninal-justice system is the built—in inefficiency of the
system. We may think we want an efficient “search ‘em
out, lock ‘em up and throw away the key” justice system,
but that’s not so.

When considering the efficiency or inefficiency of our
legal system, we must look at our Bill of Rights. The Bill
of Rights provides a guarantee for all individuals accused
of a crime.

The provisions for these rights and the resulting
fairness are what make America great. They also make
America inefficient.

We could make our justice system like a railroad. We
could make it so that anyone who is arrested gets a fast
trial, a fast conviction and a long jail sentence. But what
about the people who are wrongly accused? Their
prospects of freedom would virtually disappear in such
a system. ' .

The justice system would become an instrument of
those in power. Such people could incarcerate their
enemies and establish tyrannical rule. Their tyranny
would be preserved by the police.

These are the inherent fears of an efficient justice

Ed Kichline

system. Tyranny is antithetical to the American way. As
far as the law goes, we should keep inefficiency.

Inefficiency is also apparent in our system of income
distribution.

Sure, things are not so great when you look at the rich
and poor.

When we are in a recession, we become more conscious
of the economic situations of others. In this recession, it
looks like the rich are getting richer and the poor are
getting poorer. The separation between the two would
be a lot worse if we emphasized efficiency when it came
to doling out income. _

In an efficient income system, individuals would be
able to keep ‘everything they make as their own. People
who did not make anything would get nothing. The
American economic system, in theory and somewhat in
practice, does not work that way. i

Through graduated income taxes, welfare and other
redistributional measures, we seek to create equality.
Unfortunately, redistributionof income is inefficient.

j  Bush right on capital gains?

To enable this process, we need a government and a
bureaucracy. The people who work in the bureaucracy
need to be paid.

So some of the money taken from the rich must go to
these people.

Therefore, not all of the money from the rich goes to
the poor.

Some money is lostin the transfer process. If the system
was efficient, the poor would get every cent taken from
the rich.

To move money around like that is impossible. We.

need the government and bureaucracy to insure income
redistribution. ~

It is too bad inefficiency is inherent in the workings of
all bureaucracies.

As Americans, we are used to inefficiency. More often
than not, we create inefficiency. Think about how you
drive your car. We know that if we drive slower, we can
make our cars more fuel-efficient. But do we slow down?
No.

We look for cars that will maximize our use of fuel, but
drive them too fast, ,

It is practically impossible to get to the destination any
faster, but the increased speed burns fuel. In many ways,
we try to be inefficient.

Inefficiency is part of our lives. We would not have it
any other way.

“The time has came,” the
president said,

“to speak of many things;

“of taxes on houses, on families,
on businesses

“and especially on capital gains.”

Today, the U.S. society, with all
the proposed anti-recession
economic policies, can be as
confusing as the world in Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.

However Bush has been pushing
other policies that could, in
conjunction with a lower capital-
gains tax, push us toward a long-
term recovery. First, the proposed
increase in the tax deduction for
dependents and the proposed tax
credit for the purchase of a first
house will ease the burden of

do this we

policy begins

need to sell
American goods. But then
Americans cannot buy goods when
they don’t have jobs. Everything
becomes more confusing in this
circle,‘ especially Bush’s proposal
to lower the capital-gains tax.

“After all,” many of us ask, “isn’t
that just going to continue to make
the rich richer and the poor poorer?
How is that going to end the
recession?” The truth of the matter
is that many of the rich would
profit from a reduction in the
capital—gains tax. Because most
capital gains are profits from the
sale of securities or real estate, the
tax largely affects the upper class.

But taxing gains on individual’s
investments discourages all
investment. With a higher tax on
profits, people who have money
to invest’ will be more hesitant to
do so One of the largest ways
corporations finance growth is by
marketing securities.

Without the investment,
corporate growth is slowed and
fewer and fewer jobs are created.
Yet a decrease in the tax will
encourage investment in industry,
since it is suddenly more proﬁtable
to make a profit. Industrial growth
becomes easier.

_In isolation, a decrease in the
capital—gains tax might not be
enough to turn our economy
around because it doesn’t ensure
a growth in demand for American
goods, nor does it create jobs. But
it could keep either from

happening.

pp . the American
market. This

increase in demand for products
could spur a growth in the
economy and job creation.

To further encourage an
increased demand for American
goods, Bush has proposed the
R&D tax credit. When companies
are forced to lay employees off,
many start with research and
development. However R&D is
necessary for product
improvement and the development
of new products. Without these,
American companies have a very
small chance of improving their
position in the home or foreign
markets. And the tax credit, even
more than a deduction, makes
keeping research and development
facilities a financial benefit to the
corporation.

The decreased capital—gains tax
would further this policy’s
effectiveness by allowing the
finances to act on any findings of
research. After all, what's the point
of researching ways to improve a
product if there aren't enough
finances available to institute
changes?

So the economic policies may
have at least a little more coherency
than the world through the looking
glass. In fact, Bush’s proposed
plan seems to have a lot of merit
and may be the first steps to a
long-term economic recovery.

loosens-

This is a letter responding to
the article concerning whites’
fear of genetic annihilation in
T/9ePz'ttNews on Feb. 17, 1992.
Dr. Francis Cress Welsing’s
attitudes towards the entire
white/non-white conflict are
entirely ridiculous. Claiming
white supremacy exists out of
fear of a superior _non—white
race has brutal similarities to a
medium-sized fascist state
called Nazi Germany. You’re
not going to solve the problem
of racism by claiming that the
entire white population is
terrified of the black male’s

genitalia. Does Welsing really ,

think that the world revolves
around the supposed white’s
jealousy of the black male? 
The idea of a black superior
race is just as illegitimate as the
idea of an Aryan one.
Supremacists like Welsing
should get off of their “Blacks
have been subverted because
we're superior” platforms and
come down to reality with the
restof us. It's ridiculous ideals
made by Welsing and her
sympathizers that promote
racism. The problem isn't
solved by promoting beliefs
similar to those of Nazis and
other race—haters. Nurturing
hate and distrust, Welsing is a
poor lesson in humanity.

Disbelief with Welsing

In response to the article on
the lecture given by Dr. Francis
Cress Welsing, we would like
to express our disbelief and
extreme disappointment at the
issues raised in her speech. In
our opinion racism is not only
“white” against “non-white,”
but also “non-white” against
“white.” We were appalled at
the analogies and stereotypes
depicted. For example, Welsing
discusses Elvis Presley moving
and sounding black. We would
like to know what it means to

estate-atodstcs

Letters

move and sound “black.” This
seems to be a self—inflicted
stereotype, which she is trying
to shift onto the white
population. She claims to be
against the grouping together
of all the members of one race,
but Welsing uses the term
“white race” and includes all
the members of the white
population as being racist. We
are not all racist and do not
appreciate being termed as
such. We feel that Welsing is
blatantly hypocritical.

We are disgusted at the
analogies used to support her
theory of “the great
annihilator.” Obviously, she is
grasping at straws to support a
weak and meaningless
“theory.” We wonder if the
manufacturers of sporting
goods ever thought that their
products would be exploited
in such a ridiculous and
revolting manner.

In closing, we would like
Welsing to answer for us the
following question dealing with
“society’s infatuation with ball
games:” Why in baseball, does
a player enclose a hard, white
ball in a soft, brown mitt?

Go see Dr. Ruth, Welsing
The article in the. Feb. 17
edition of The Pitt News by
Alissa Smith concerning the
lecture by Francis Cress
[Welsing] (“Author says whites
fear genetic extinction”) was
an insult to the white students
of this university. Such racist
propaganda is an insult to all
of the students at Pitt. Her
assault on white people in the
U.S. by describing 'white-male

genitalia as the “great equalizer"
against the black-male
genitalia, the “great
annihilator,” was a sure sign
this woman is not only a racist,
but a sexist to boot.

The article goes on to
describe her conclusion that
sports containing balls are all
about testicles [which] shows
that this woman _has a few
screws loose. ‘

Maybe she could contact the
Kinsey Institute or Dr. Ruth to

deal with her evident sexual

frustration. This racistlatertalks
about knowing what fear is,
but she doesn’t come close.
Her fear seems to be that she
can’t accept reality—the reality
that she needs psychological
help. It looks to me like she's
suffering from a bad case of

penis envy.

Study Aboard valuable

justifiably concerned with
the financial policies of the
present Pitt administration, Ms.
[Melissa] Weitz suggests that
university monies be better
channeled to meet student
needs [The Pitt News, Feb. 20].
Cutting funds designated for
Study Abroad is one of her
suggestions.

I submit that Study Abroad
—- made available to every Pitt
student, incidentally —
provides invaluable
educational opportunities
which strongly complement
Pitt's on-campus academics.
The cultural insights and global
perspective with which a study-
abroad student returns are well
in line with ‘Pitt's goal of
providing each student with a
well-balanced education.

Though agreeing with Ms.
Weitz that Pitt's financial
policies be reviewed, I believe
that Study Abroad is still worthy
of substantial university
support.

to play, the score was knotted at 70. From
there, the Pitt frontline took control, as
either Morningstar, McNeal, Orlando
Antigua or Eric Mobley scored Pitt's final
16 points.

Antigua scored six points in crunch
time, including a big three—pointer at the
4:50 mark. The Panthers also made 11 of
12 free throws once the Huskies starting
fouling to get the ball back.

The Panthers’ uncanny free-throw
accuracy was evidenced by McNeal’s 11 of

Pitt player missed more than one free
throw, and that includes previous
bricklayers Morningstar and Mobley.

It was a homecoming of sorts last night
at Fitzgerald Field House, and the Panthers
celebrated with an 86-77 Big East win over
24th-ranked Connecticut.

Plenty of things returned to the Panthers’
game, but the most important were the
inside power game and competent free-
throw shooting.

Pitt (16-12, 8-7 in conference play)
received 42 points from the tandem of
Chris McNeal and Darren Morningstar,
and the team converted 24 of 28 shots
from the charity stripe. ’

“We got inside pretty well because we
had more patience than in the past,” said
Pitt head coach Paul Evans. “All of our big
kids played very well.”

McNeal did double duty, pulling down
a team-high 12 rebounds to go along with
his garne-high 2'5 points.

“I played pretty well in the last few
games, but I thought tonight was a coming-
out party for me,” McNeal said.

Connecticut (17-7, 8-7) kept the pressure
on, all game, as Chris Smith scored 22
points and Scott Burrell added 21. But
while the Huskies were shooting well,
they could not stop the Panthers’ inside
game.

Morningstar broke out of his scoring
slump with 19 points, most coming on

short, baseline hook shots. For the game,
the 6-foot, 10-inch senior converted eight
of 15 shots from the floor.

‘‘I think Pitt did a great job of getting the
ball down low,” said Connecticut head
coach Jim Calhoun. “We just didn't play
good interior defense.

“I'm disappointed in our defense,” he
said. ‘‘If we shoot 50 percent, we should
win the game.”

The Pitt women’s track team
saw several of its recent

fall this weekend at the Big East
indoor track championships in

ﬁnished eighth out of 10 schools,
head coach Steve Lewis said he
‘was pleased with the results.
“All the kids did a great job,"
Lewis said. “We broke several

“We are traditionally
overachievers," he said. “We got
a lot more out of our team forthe
money we put in.”

The Lady Panthers garnered 35
points, ﬁnishing ahead of Miami
of Florida and Boston College. As
usual, the veterans paced the
effort. The team got two second-
places, one from junior Monica
Hockaday in the 500-meter run
and the other from Ronice
Crumpler in the 400 meters.

Hockaday’s time of 1:11.99 was

just .78 seconds behind winner
Steffanie Smith of meet-winner
Georgetown.

Crumpler, also a junior, ran the
400 in just over 55 seconds, but
Seton Hall’s Flirtisha Harris and
Cheryl Brantle. of Connecticut
both broke the conference record
of former Pitt star Keisha Demas,
set last year, by .01 seconds.
Crumpler also was a finalist in the
55-meter dash; she placed sixth
with a time of 7.22 seconds.

“In terms of leadership and
performance, our upperclassmen,

our so-called leaders, really
showed the way,” Lewis said.

Women get first look at rookie Lobo in

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

When the Pitt women’s
basketball team takes the floor at
Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn.,
for its game against the
Connecticut Huskies tonight, it
will only be the beginning of a
four—year voyage into unknown
waters.

The reason for this journey is
embodied in Connecticut’s
Rebecca Lobo, a f irst-year player
who was the top high—school
recruit in women’s basketball last
year. At 6—feet, 4-inches, Lobo
possesses skills that the Panthers
will witness firsthand for the first
time. I
“She’s the kind of player that
we have never faced since we’ve
been in the Big East,” Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “She’s 6-3

or 6-4, and she can do things that I

people her same size can’t.”

Lobo had to sit out of the
meeting between the two teams
at Fitzgerald Field House on Jan.
25 due to a fractured left wrist.
Since returning to the lineup two
weeks ago, she has garnered two
Big East Rookie of the Week
awards, bringing her total to six
on the year.

She currently ranks second on
the team in scoring with a 15.1
average per contest. She leads
the team in rebounding, snagging
8.5 a game. Only four teams have
held her below double—digits in
scoring this season, and only two
of those were conference

opponents. Syracuse held her to
four points and six boards. That
occurred while the
Orangewomen had the services
of the now—injured, 6-S Holly
Oslander.

Seton Hall held Lobo to only
six points, but she still managed
to grab 10 boards over 6-3 center
Kelley Moore and 6-2 forward
Dawn Johnson.

Pitt lacks the size of both of
these teams. Starting center
Carolyn Miller stands 6-5 but lacks
the quickness needed to stop
Lobo. Jonna Huemrich, a 6-0
forward, may be the Panthers’
best bet to try and neutralize the
Huskies’ frosh phenom.

“It’s definitely going to be
interesting to see how we handle
this situation,” Bruce said. “We
have to try and keep the ball out
of her hands on offense and then
try and keep her off of the boards-
That’s easier said than done, but
I think we can do it.”

Even if the Lady Panthers ﬁgure
out how to stop Lobo, they still

Wendy Davis has proven to be a
force at shooting guard this year,
averaging 16 points a game to
lead her team. Forward Meghan
Pattyson has been a steady
contributor all year, averaging 10
points a game. Another first—year
player, Pam Webber, rocked the
Panthers for 14 points in their
previous meeting. That was her
career high at the time, and she
averages eight points a contest.

While expectations for student
athletes are high on the playing
field, they will be even higher in
the classroom.

Last month, at the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
convention, the president's
commission adopted Proposition
16, a rule that strengthens and
raises existing academic standards
that athletes must meet before
they are allowed to compete.

Proposition 16 mandates that
all incoming student athletes must
have earned at least a 2.5 grade-
point average in 13 college-
preparatory courses and either a
17 on the ACT test or a 700 on the
SAT to qualify for athletic
eligibility during their first year.
Those who do not qualify must
sit out a year, leaving them with
only three years of eligibility.
This policy will be enacted in
1995.

In 1986, Proposition 48 was
introduced. It required student
athletes to post at least a 2.0 GPA
in only 1] college-preparatory
courses along with the same 700
score on the SAT.

As quoted in Unewspaper,_Iim
Marcioni, a spokesperson for the

NCAA, said, “Research indicates
that the 2.5 GPA correlates closer
with a 700 on the SAT than a 2.0.
The president's commission was
interested in weighting the GPA
more toward the test scores."
Like its predecessor, Prop 48,
Prop 16 is already drawing fire
from college coaches and
administrators who feel the test
scores are an unfair basis for
determining eligibility.
“Basically, these test scores
should not be used as a bottom-
line factor in denying education
because they are discriminatory
to women, minorities and low-
income groups,” Sarah Stockwell,

a member of an objective testing _

group, told U.

Aside from Prop 16, the
commission also voted to
strengthen the continuing
eligibility standards, ones that
athletes must maintain once they
are granted eligibility or be forced
to leave their respective teams.

College administrators, such as
Georgetown’s Athletic Director
Francis X. Rienzo, have also
expressed a dissatisfaction with
Prop 16, insisting that the SATS
are a socio-economic issue and
that they are unfair to deprived
groups, who for the most part do
not have access to good

educational facilities.

Even the people who could be
coaching athletes affected by Prop
16 have attacked the NCAA Two
noted and vocal opponents to
the requirements are Georgetown
basketball head coach John
ThompsonandTemple basketball
head coach John Chaney. Both
are coaches of “high-profile”
programs, and both feel that Prop
16 and Prop 48 are racist toward
the black athlete. They insist that
blacks do not have the same
educational advantages as whites
and that basing eligibility on a
test is wrong.

And how does all of this greet
the administration at the
University of Pittsburgh?

Here at Pitt, the academic
requirements are even stricter
than those being imposed by the
NCAA. Pitt requires all incoming
students to have at least a 2.0 in
15 college-core courses. Students
who fall below these
requirements are dealt with on
an individual basis, and, if
admitted, they are placed on a
probationary period. Those who
fail to raise their work to meet
these standards are no longer
allowed to attend Pitt, athlete or
not. These standards and
admission procedures are

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, February 26, 1992

 
Proposition 16 not going to aﬂect Pcmtbers, AD jozynes says

governed by the faculty, not the
athletic department.

While the introduction of this
bill has met with much criticism,
here at Pitt, Director of Athletics
Ovaljaynes expressed a different
sentiment toward the new
standards and how athletes, once
admitted, should be dealt with at
any university.

“Once in place, the young
people tend to meet the standards
that are set, ” he said. “Unless they
are unreasonably set, they don't
have problems." '

Unlike other critics, Jaynes said
he does not feel thestandards
discriminate against minorities.

“The data collected by the
NCAA research committee has
indicated no drop in the level of
enrollment of minority students,”
Jaynes added.

Jaynes stated that as the athletic
director he “sets the tone for the
entire athletic program.” He said
it is a university’s place to get the
best students it can get. What he
does have a problem with are
student athletes who do not take
full advantage of the academic
aspect of the university. Those,
he said, are common abuses at
today’s universities.

to not take advantage of

academics,” Jaynes said. “This is
where the system fails.”

Prop 16 still will not change
Pitt’s tactics in the recniitment of
athletes, though. Jaynes said the
goal here is to recruit the best
student athlete. All athletes who
enter the university are expected
to work toward a degree. He said
he feels overall that the same

-enthusiasm a player shows on

the playing field will be transferred
to the classroom, pointing to past
scholar athletes such as football’s
Mark Stepnoski and present
graduate—student athletes like
basketball’s Darren Morningstar.

For most athletes at Pitt and
across the country, their athletic
careers will end on the field or in
the gym on the final day of the
season during their senior year.
The college degree provides a
means for the athlete to make it
in society after the cheering has
stopped. Jaynes said that in his
years of working with student
athletes (before Pitt, he was at
Auburn), the thing he hates most
to see is when an athlete leaves
the school without an education.
He said he realizes that for a
small percentage of student
athletes, millions are waiting for
them in professional sports. But
the degree will remain long after
the money has been spent.

“Athletic ability is a God—given
talent,” Jaynes said. “A college
degree is something you earn.
Once you have earned it, no one
can take that away.”

With all of these weapons,
Connecticut does not have to
worry too much about one of its
players having a bad night or
being shut down. However they
do cause many a sleepless night
for opposing coaches.

“They definitely have a lot of
options to go to,” Bruce said. “If
you shut them down one place,
they go to another. We’ve come
out and played junk defense on
them before, trying to key on
certain people, throwing them

out and play them straight up.
Everybody is going to have to
play real hard if we’re going to

This match up against the
Huskies could not come at a
worse time for the Panthers. After
a tough game at Miami, they
defeated Seton Hall in what Bruce
called one of his teams’ best
efforts all year. But since then the
Lady Panthers have lost the
aggressiveness Bruce hoped they
could maintain the rest of the
season.

“I think we’ve taken a step
backward, in terms of our
aggressiveness,” Bruce said. “We
had a let-down against Boston
College, deﬁnitely a team that we
should have beaten. Saturday,
we had a lapse against St. John's
that killed us. We can’t control
how the other team comes out.
We have to come out fighting for

Eight Panthers try
to irnpress scouts

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

The April 26-27 NFL draft
promises to be a good one for
several Panther prospects. At
the NFL combine, held
recently inlndianapolis, Ind.,
there was a gang of eight
Panthers, all of them trying
their darndest to make a lasting
impression upon the gathering
of NFL scouts and general
managers.

The group included
defensive linemen Sean
Gilbert and Keith Hamilton,
offensive linemen Scott Miller
and Jeff Christy, tight ends
Dave Moore and Eric Seaman,
linebacker Ricardo McDonald
and defensive back Steve
Israel.

All eight players are likely
to be ‘drafted. Gilbert and
Hamilton reportedly did not
draw rave reviews in
Indianapolis but are still
expected to be drafted in the
first two rounds. It’s generally
known that a good
performance at the combine
can raise a player’s stock.
Conversely, a bad
performance can hurt a
player’s stock.

According to NFL sources,
there were a number of players
whose stock rose significantly.
They included Notre Dame
tight end Derek Brown, Florida
State fullback Edgar Bennett
and Texas A&M cornerback
Kevin Smith.

Players who turned in
disappointing performances
included Texas defensive end
Shane Dronett, Michigan
offensive tackle Greg
Skrepanek and Washington
wide receiver Mario‘ Bailey.

Sports agent Ralph Cindrich,
a former Pitt linebacker who
represents several NFL players,
said he sees Pitt’s McDonald,

Israel, Gilbert and Hamilton as “

potential ﬁrst—round selections.
“In talking with people out
there,” Cindrich said, “those
are the names that seem to
come up for the first round.”

Hamilton and Gilbert are
among a group of 34
underclassmen who have
declared their eligibility for the
draft. Other notable
underclassmen who have
decided to give up the
remainder of their college
eligibility in order to pursue a
professional career include
Heisman Trophy winner and
Michigan wideout Desmond
Howard, standout Washington
defensive tackle Steve Emtrnan,
Florida State defensive back
Terrell Buckley, and Georgia
Tech linebacker Marco
Coleman.

Pitt has not had a player
selected in the first round since
the 1989 draft, when defensive
end Burt Gross man was chosen
by the San Diego Chargers and
the Pittsburgh Steelers used a
first-round pick to select
offensive tackle T om Ricketts.

We all knew it was coming.
The trade of Paul Coffey had
been in the hopper for months,
and nobody was surprised when
the announcement was made at
the press conference on
Wednesday. The one thing
nobody anticipated was the

consequential trade of Mark.

Recchi to the Flyers.

Both men were extremely
popular among Pens fans, and
their departure has left a lot of
somber faces and negative
attitudes toward Penguin
management. I was surprised by
the trade of Coffey and Recchi
simply because it occurred just as

’ the Pens’ losing streak ended.

Here’s where everyone asks,
“What was the whole purpose of
this trade?”

Well, take a look at this.

First of all, in light of the fact
that the Pens have steadily
plummeted in the Patn'ck'Division
standings, a shake-u p in the roster
was clearly needed. Late last
February, when the Pens hit a
slump similar to their recent skid,
General Manager Craig Patrick
orchestrated a six-man swap with
the Hartford Whalers, which
sparked the Pens to a 9-2-1 tear
through the month of March.
Hopefully, this trade will have a
similar effect on the club’s
performance.

Secondly, I believe that some
of the primary focal points of this
trade were to take some pressure
off Mario Lemieux and to keep
Kevin Stevens out of the penalty

box. Stevens has accumulated a
busload of penalty minutes this
year — mainly because he is
trying to keep the hackers of the
NHL off Lemieux. The size and
power of Jeff Chychran and Kjell
Samuellsson should keep the
goon squad occupied and allow
Stevens to focus his mind on
scoring goals instead ofguarding
Mario.

And lastly, let’s keep in mind
that Craig Patrick is a master of
trade negotiations. In two years
as GM of the Penguins, Patrick,
through numerous trades and
free—agent negotiations, has
added several players who were
key elements in the Pens’ rise
from cellar dwellers to Stanley
Cup champs. This impressive list
consists of such players as Bryan
T rottier, Joey Mullen, Ron Francis
and Ulf Samuellsson, to name a
few.

Now try to imagine this.

Imagine a line with Lemieux at
center, Stevens at left wing and
Rick Tocchet at right wing. What
you are looking at right there is
the ‘finest line in the NHL — two

_ 11. E

in the NHL to boot. Then imagine
the two Swedish countrymen, Ulf
and Kjell Samuellsson, backing

Ulf, known for his thunderous I

check, is already a force in the
neutral zone, and Kjell, aided by
the NHL’s longest reach, would
be a nightmare for opposing

players entering the Penguins"

zone.
The only real down spot to this
whole trade that I can see is the

Penguins’ power—play situation, 

now that Coffey is gone. Despite
all his years in the NHL, Coffey is
still one of the fastest skaters in
the game. His departure will
change the whole outlook on the
power play. Tocchet will probably
be installed in the new power-
play unit, but who knows how
many other changes will have to
be made to make that unit
function well.

announced, more rumors began A

The monster Pens-Kings-Flyers
menage a trois is a week old
now, and nearly every opinion
tendered by the amateur Colliers
and Steigerwalds of the
lunchroom world has focused on
the Pens’ future with their new
players.

Post-trade gossip (“How ‘bout

-aTocchet-Lemieux-Stevens line!"
“Which goalie will they trade?”
and “No more wimpy Penguins,
huh?”) has clogged air traffic
around coffee machines all over
Allegheny county, creating a

‘ veritable din of S—P—O~R-T-S chat

for those (perish the thought!)
non-athletic types.

And while the idea ofannoying
“commoners” with frivolous
hockey talk gives me a sinister
kick, the content of the banter
doesn’t get me off at all. Before
we cheer on the newly acquired
Pens, I want to remind’ every
hockey fan of three things: the
contributions of the ex-Pens, the
big gamble the team took in
tearing apart a Stanley Cup
nucleus (that never was together
long enough to defend this year)
and how much it will regret
making such a move.

For starters, what did All-Star
Mark Recchi and future Hall of
Famer Paul Coffey do to deserve
to be traded? I mean other than
display a level of talent and class
that most hockey players only
dream of achieving.

Obviously, there are several
reasons why the trade happened

 12' I I  
' Pens will regret dealing Coffey and

+— dumping big contracts,
improving defense, improving
“our physical presence on the
ice” and new team chemistry, to
name a few. And I'll agree that
competent justifications can be
made for all of them. But before
every Pittsburgh hockey fan goes
off on another speil about how
this is “just like last year’s Hartford
deal” and how the Pens needed
a kick in the butt to get “back on
track,” look at what the Penguins
organization did by trading Coffey
and Recchi: It got rid of the
leading scorer and the best
defenseman from a defending
championship team — a team
that never got the chance to win
it again. Furthermore, the Pens
rid themselves of two proven
winners who had little to do with
the Pens’ subpar performance
this season.

What particularly bothers me
about the whole deal is the
thinking that both Coffey and
Recchi have been anointed the
fall guys for the team’s problems.
Neither player had anything to
do with the real reasons why the
Pens were playing pathetic
hockey and needed a quick fix:
lack of team chemistry and
injuries.

Both players have defensive
liabilities, but those flaws were
no reason to get rid of them.

The Pens aren’t sputtering in
fourth place because of Coffey’s
backehecking; they are sputtering
because the team has never been
together all year .

You can’t blame Coffey or
Recchi for the missing team
chemistry. This underappreciated
and invaluable entity left the

be hard pressed to find two

the least, they did nothing
substantial to douse the ﬂame.

Recchi was on pace with
another productive year and
continued to push his undersized
exterior to the fullesty.

As for Coffey, he was off to his
best point and plus/minus totals
as a Pen — until trade rumors
became etched in his 30-year-old
body like the telltale heart. Interim

postseason. They might have
made the World Series. Yes, I am
a frustrated young man.

At least free agency has finally
aided the team in one respect.
Bob “Round-tripper” Kipper is
finally gone, signed away by the
Twins. Now will somebody please
tell me how a team that would
use him in the Hubert H.
Humphrey “Homerdome” won
the @#$% World Series?

At least there is solace to be
found in the man running the
Penguins, Craig Patrick. He is the
best general manager in the
business. There may be others in
the organization resting on their
laurels after last season’s
championship, but it sure isn’t
Patrick. Last week’s trade seems
to totally change the makeup and
chemistry of the team.

It has been suggested that he
could have just done nothing and
let the coach and players take the
blame as the team struggled.
Really, it is tough to put the
blame on anybody. This team
lost a beloved head coach to
cancer. It suffered major player
losses through injury and
suspension. It went through the
sale of the team and the
accompanying rumors in addition
to trade rumors.

Patrick alleviated the one of
those things in his control. He
dealt with the trade rumors by
trading the guy most of the rumors
were about, Paul Coffey. With

the exception of an impending
trade of one of the team’s four
goalies, either Wendell Young or
Frank Pietrangelo, the current
team is the one that will take this
team to the postseason. That is, if
it gets it together before it blows
its playoff spot.

Speaking of goaltenders, no, it
should definitely not be Tom
Barasso who goes. Some Penguin
fans in the search for a scapegoat
have settled on Barasso. They
think he should go and let newly
acquired Ken Wregget take over
as No. 1 goalie. In a word,
WRONG!

Barasso hasn’t been great, but
he has been solid this season.
Having a dependable No. 2 goalie
in Wregget will help Barasso.
Besides, does anybody remember
how great he was in the playoffs
last season? Just because
Pietrangelo did well in the few
games when he filled in for
Barasso, some fans think the Pens
could have won the
championship without Barasso.
Forget it. Not only does he do a
better job stopping the opposing
team, Barasso helps the Penguins’
offense. He does this with his
passing and the fact that his
teammates are more daring when
they know they have him backing
them up.

The question is how will the
new mix work. The new-look
Pens are definitely very physical.

Canadiens Saturday, but they
were knocking people around.
Rick Tocchet, Kjell Samuelsson
andJeffChychrun are all physical
players. If the game in Montreal
is any indication, the other Pens,
especially Troy Loney, have
embraced a more physical style.
Now if these guys can remember
that they still have to score goals.

There is a very real down side.
First of all, I wonder about any
trade that involves the loss of a
future Hall-of—Famer (Coffey) and
an all—star (Recchi).

Tocchet is prone to injury and
has been having a bad offensive
year with only 31 points. With
Coffey and Mark Recchi gone,
the team will be counting on him
and Ron Francis, who are both
struggling on the offensive end
this season, to pick up the slack.
The team was already taking too
many foolish penalties, especially
Kevin Stevens, and Tocchet will
add to that total. The team just
might not be able to adjust to the
new style at such a late stage of
the season. Remember, the Pens

don’t have Bob Johnson to bring
the new players into the mix
gradually, like they did last season.

They are also getting older. -

Coffey may be past his prime, but
Recchi is only 24. Samuelsson is

33, and Tocchet is a beat—up 28..

The team already has some older
players in Brian Trottier, Joey
Mullen and Francis. Add to that
the uncertainty of Mario I.emieux’s
future due to back problems. The
hope is that youngsters likeJamie
Leach and prospects like ’91 top
pick Markus Naslund and
Olympian Shawn McEachern will
fill in, but they are far from sure
things.

What we are left to do is one
thing: Trust the best general
manager in hockey. This guy has

hit the jackpot with questionable‘ A

trades before, especially the big
one with Hartford last season. He
got Mullen for a second-round
draft choice, Trottier for nothing
and draftedJaromirJagr. He built
a Stanley Cup champion. I may
actually start to like this @#$%
trade.

contributions.

An average of $1,116 per year is donated toward religious
organizations and an average of $180 to $271 is contributed to
other non-profit organizations by NEED alumni.

According to the study, 76 percent of NEED alumni volunteer
their time for non-profit organizations, compared with the
national average of 45 percent of all U.S. adults.

“It’s clear from our study that the African-American male, like
his white counterpart in the U.S., disproportionately reaps the’
financial benefits from increased education,” Yamatani said.

But the study also revealed that on the average, African-
American men earned between 12.5 and /13.5 percent more
money than their female counterparts, who have the same
amount of education. ,

Director of the Buhl I"-‘oundation Doreen Boyce .said, “This
study provides a unique opportunity to document the effect of
a financial—aid program and to learn something about the return
one gets on this kind of educational investment.”

NEED was established in 1963 here as a “temporary effort to
find funds for 76 African-American high—school students who
had been accepted to college.

“The achievements attained by the Nliiil) alumni are an
example of the tangible benefits to be gained from supporting
those individuals with limited ﬁnancial resources who aspire to
higher educational goals in life,” Yamatani said.

met her husband while she was
an undergraduate at North-
western University. She was
taking a graduate summer course
in" Renaissance poetry (“a real
yawner," Smith said) when she
looked up and saw a guy in
cutoff jeans and sandals wink at

“I had never seen anyone
dressed like that before,” she
said.

Since getting tenure, Smith said
her responsibilities at Pitt have
increased, “and being Mrs. Chair
doesn’t help.”

Some of the changes Smith
said she would like to see at Pitt
are an increase in the number of

women in the faculty and
administration and Continued
efforts to make the undergraduate
population “more global‘ and
globally aware” concerning
diversity. She said she also hopes
that Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor’s “promises of
openness are real and not
rhetoric.”

Stokes

Continued from page 1
“Economic policy is not made by
economists and not always
determined by reasons given by
economists. There is a wide
variety of people. Social policy is
not created by sociologists. There
is a need to understand the public
sector and how the public sector
interacts.”

Sontheimer said progress in
social research is being made,
especially in social sciences here
at Pitt. Pitt is involved with human
involvementanddecision—making
in different departments.

“If we are going to put together
basic and applied. research in
social sciences  we will have to
recognize that social sciences will
have to become  controversial,"
Bobrow said.

Bobrow said there will be a
revival of reform of social sciences
during the next decade. He said
there will be a need to return to
the role of university “social
experimentation,” trying things
out and trying to make them
work.

“This is exciting. This is

challenging," Bobrow said.

Professor Hays moved to the
topic of social problems. There
are a lot of people in society
engaging in. public affairs, he
said.

According to Hays, civic
education is emphasized in high
schools. “I do not think we have
taken it up in college education
as much as we could have.”

Hays said knowledge is a major
problem in social sciences and it
needs to be reorganized. He said
science needs interaction with

other skills; microbiologists need A

policy and vice-versa.

Stokes said there needs to be
political renewal of the
university's disciplinary map in
general.

Hays said a major roadblock
for social sciences is that university
libraries do not have much of the
information used by decision

makers ofthe nation. He said that

students should have the ability
to go to a library and really get
into research which is not readily
found.

provide a role in education,” Hays
said. “I think that there is an
opportunity for universities to
establish strong relationships with
the public.”

Sabloff said anthropology was
the forgotten social science. “It
seems to me the fortunes and
interests of anthropology inside
and outside the university have
taken some pendulum swings,”
he said.

Sabloff said while anthropology
is not of great publicinterest,
there has been a recent resurgence
of interest.

According to Sabloff, many .

undergraduates who are studying
multinational subjects are saying
that an anthropology background
is extremely helpful.

Anthropology also corresponds
to the breaking of disciplinary
boundaries because it can be
linked with a whole series of
fields, he said.

“As we make ‘progress in
research, we will also be making
progress in teaching. We will
teach our students more about
the world in which we live,”
Sontheimer said.

Hays said there needs to be a

better system for exposure of
knowledge. . ’

“The key to ﬂourishing by [the

year] 2002 is our willingness to
go on crafting intellectual
frameworks,” Stokes said.
