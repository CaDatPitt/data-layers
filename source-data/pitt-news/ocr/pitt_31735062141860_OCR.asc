PRICE FIVE CENTS

Fraternities
Vote To Drop
Fifth Hour

Council Reacts Favorably to
Change in Schedule;
See Two Angles

——....—..

Beck Sees Ar-hprantages

 

Almost simultaneously with the
writing of the editorial in the Friday
issue of the News suggesting the
dropping of ﬁfth hour classes from
block schedules, Interfraternity Coun-
cil at its regular monthly .meeting

Thursday night, unanimously passed,
1

a resolution recommending “abolish-
ment -of fifth hour classes and the
esta.;blishment- of an official lunch.
period.”

The question. of the extent of the
disadvantages of 12:30. to 1:30 o’clock
classes on the campus was brought
up at the meeting at the "Lambda Chi
Alpha house immediately after the
conferencegot ,under way, and was

marked by much discussion and ex- _

changes of opinion.
Attack From Two Angles

-The representatives of the various
fraternities attacked the problem un-

der two distinct angles: ﬁrst, general ,

reasons pointing to a need for a reg-
iifar lunch hour; and second, reasons
pi_i,rticularly calling for united frater-
nfity action.

Under the ﬁrst heading, that per-
taining to the welfare of the student
bddy as a whole,» the Council listed
the following favorable results of a
lunch period’ at this time: a rise in
the standard of student health, caused

by."’establ'ishment "of regular 'meal*

times and abolishment of practices of
trying to eat in the few minutes be-
tween classes; a. stronger feeling of
school spirit on the part of students;
a greater interest in extracurricular
activities; and a larger opportunity
for social activity by participation in
luncheon club meetings» and noon-‘
time friendships. " ‘
Favorable Fraternities
Interfraternity Council also saw in
the proposed reform certain results
particularly favorable to its member-
ship: a greater spirit of fraternalism.
especially .. between out-of-town. and
city men. aided by the opportunities
for the two groups to meet much
more often than at formal chapter
meetings and initiations; and also an
additional source of income to the
houses through their kitchens.

VVith tomorrow set, as the ﬁnal day
for entering the YM & "WHA student
council. debating tournament, six
teams are already registered to dis-
cuss the question. .“Resolved: That
Palestine be established as a social-
istic commonwealth.”

For purposes of "the debate, partici-
pants are to assume that Palestine
has been released from British con-
trol and that its government rests in
the hands of its inhabitants. Thus,
the fundamental issue involves Social-
ism versus enlightened Capitalism as_
the economic order for that country.

In addition to all undergraduates of
Pitt, Tech, Duquesne, and Friclc
Teachers’ Training School, former
students who were registered as un-
dergraduates last year and could not

proposed ﬁfth hour lunch period the,

but, more particularly, the advantages
also to be gained by the entire stu-
dent body.”

The News, in its Friday issue, con-
cerned its editorial chieﬂy with the
inconvenience of ﬁfth hour classes to
freshmen and sophomores in any do-
partments whose block schedules
deny them the privilege of regular
meal periods, recommending that
action be taken before the Septem-
ber schedule is completed.

Mr. Hovey states, “There has re-
cently been a great revival of interest
in modern art through the recent es-
tablishment of the Museum of Mod-
ern Art in New York and also in

Penn that evening‘, will be exchanged
upon the payment of the additional
three dollars, in Room 801 Cathedral
of Learning, or at the booth, now be-
ing erected on the first ﬂoor of Alumni
Hall.

Since more than 225 reservations
had been made for the fraternities
chief social event of the year, it was
decided at a meeting of the commit-
tee, under the chairmanship of Dan
Smith, to engage the grand ballroom.
The committee had also held options
on the Urban Room, but the advance
sale clearly demonstrated the import-
ance of obtaining the larger dance
floor.

‘Saturday evening, Smith motored
to Cleveland to h'ear"Red Nichols and
his orchestra perform. Since his re-
turn he has l1a_d._n,othing—.but praise
for the Int,erfraternity’s -choice" in the
matter of music provision: “I’m not
shouting about this hand because I
think l't’s good press agent stuff,”
Smith said yesterday, “I just can’t
help it. He plays real music, the kind
of music that's slow at times, fast at
times———but not too fast, We the type
of melodyfthat just makes you want
to dance.” ' ‘ V

With Nichols will appear June Ray,‘
soloist of the 12—piece orchestra, as an
added a,tt,raction. . '

Mr. and Mrs. L. C. McCand_lis's, Mr.
and Mrs. R. F. Edgar, and Mr. and
Mrs. C, R. Wilson, have been selected
as chaperons for the ball.

Favors for the ball will be an addi-
tional surprise believes Smith. “They
are favors, the like of which have
never been giyen before, either at Pitt
or any other college dance in the
country,” was his reply when pressed
for answer to this question.

A national broadcast carried the
-music of-Red Nichols and his orches-
tra over WCAE in a noon broadcast,
yesterday, The committee has had
word from the NBC that another noon
broadcast will be carried tomorrow at

Business Review Records Drop

In Recent

Industrial Activity

 

The old ground hog, “better times,”
came out of his hole early last fall,
stayed with us a little while, and
then, when the sun came out, saw his

shadow and ran for shelter,

According to the Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review, monthly publication of
the Bureau of Business Research,
edited by Mr. Bervard Nichols, busi-
ness throughout the country increased
very noticeably and encouragingly
last fall, continued to improve during
the early part‘ of November, and fell
off sharply in December. To quote
the Review, “The revival of conﬁdence
which accompanied the rise in busi-
ness activity during the early fall
months received severe setbacks dur-
ing November and the early part of
December.”

Several factors helped cause the
break. The election campaign was
one of these. The chorus of dire pre-
dictions about each other’s policies
which the Republicans and the Demo-
crats set up had‘ awlisquieting effect.

The war debts and the diﬂicul.ties
connected with these also had a dis-

astrous result. Industry was effected
by other discouraging movements.
The Review says, “Then there was
uncertainty regarding legislative de-
velopments in the short session of
Congress. Furthermore, the slump in
the prices of wheat‘, cotton, livestock,
silver, and copper, adversely affected
the already low purcliasing power of
the producers of these commodities
at home and abroad.

The Review does not suggest that
the drop was anything serious, and
shows that other industries held up
fairly well. The automobile indus-
try, for instance, showed improve-
ment in November, and it was thought
the gain would continue throughout
December.

Despite the -fact that there were
some bank failures during the last
two months, we read in the Business
Research monthly that the ﬁnancial
situation was favorable during No-
vember and part of December. The
Review also indicates that the index
of local business activity advanced
from ..45.,§l in October to ,47.5 in. No-
vember, 4" v_ .-_ ,  =-

Tec/mocracy Needs F urther
Investigation, Tyson States

 

Editor’s Note—-This is the fourth of
a series of interviews with prominent
business men and industrial and
economic leaders and authorities in
the Pittsburgh -district
economic affairs. The fifth will ap-
pear in an early issue.

 

.By JACK BUNTER

The Technocracy of Mr, Howard
Scott and his associate Technocrats is
the result of absurd conclusions made
from only partial data, believes Dr.
Francis Tyson, professor of economics
here. Furthermore, he thinks the
conclusions of those who propose this
revolutionary idea of substituting a
better ‘economic system for the one
we have, and for creating somewhat
of an El_.Dorado-here in the United
States, will not stand analysis.

Technocracy, to many people, is
just another four syllable word in-
vented by the big moguls of the Eng-
lish language, or one more thing for
Junior to ask about; but, for millions
of Americans who are wondering how
soon they can ﬁll the family pocket-
book with something except air, it
brings up the all—important question,
“Is there anything to it?” Dr. Tyson
has this to say about its qualities and
powers. He states, “Technoc1‘a.cy
illustrates in a dramatic way the new
interest of engineers and physical sci-
entists in economics. It directs atten-
tion to vast wealth-producing possi-
bilities of the New Age of Power.
This wealth might be used to limit
poverty and organize the increasing

leisure of the masses.
What Is Their "Plan?

Since the originators of the new
idea have said a lot about this dis-
placer of capitalism but have not yet
told enough to satisfy anyone of the
feasibility of their‘ plan, Dr. Tyson
says, “The Technocrats must be asked
more deﬁnitely about their plan for
reorganizing society under technical
leadership. How do they purpose to
win and wield power?” Then he con-
tinues, “Here they seem to be mil-
lenial; there is nothing new about
Utopianism. What is their plan?”

regarding.

Dr. Tyson would not accept Tech-
nocracy merely because it sounds
good and because it is offered as a
cure—all for depressions and other
troubles. Believingfthat there should
be a little ..detecti.ve .wor.kdone in-re-
gard to it before we either accept or
reject it, he suggests, “A group of re-
sponsible engineers, and economists
and statisticians (since the Techno-
cra.ts have boldly invaded the ﬁeld of
the latter group of scientists), should
examine their methods and ﬁndings
with great care.”

Dr. Tyson believes that little of
what has been written about Techno-
cracy is deﬁnite or.lucid; that little
of anything that has been written tells
how the Technocrats would do what
they want to do. _

Drawing Absurd Conclusions

However, he thinks they have
something good to offer the country.

.,They . evidently have" a. *-worth.-while

and potentially signiﬁcant research
project in the ﬁeld of power use," he
says. “But their spokesman, Mr.
Howard Scott, and his supporting
journalists are drawing absurd con-
clusions from partial data that are
not likely to stand analysis.” Too,
he thinks the Technocrats are too
hasty in saying that’ the price system
is inadequate, has outworn its use-
fulness, and will collapse because it
is unﬁt for the technological structure
of our modern society.

As a ﬁnal opinion, Dr. Tyson has
this to say. He states “The current
publicity 011 Technocracy amounts al-
most to a mania. It is a sad reflec-
tion on the lack of balance in our
emotional population; the interest
arises, of course, out of the general
desire to end.'the- depression. But
constructive effort to that‘ important
end demands constructive contribu-
tions from economists, industrialists,
and ﬁnanciers. Above all, it calls for
a new knowledge about international
economic problems and a new sense
of responsibility for world leadership
on the part of the United States.”

Keep Slate Clean in Eastern
League Competition at
Pavilion Saturday

Cribbs Sutters Foot lniury

 

Whatexrer hopes the Temple cagers
entertained of quashing Pitt’s cham-
pionship aspirations in the newly or-
ganized eastern basketball league
were forgotten for the time after the
first 30 seconds of play in the teams‘
first meeting in the Stadium pavilion
Saturday evening.

Aroused by the fact that the Tom-
pleites were first to ﬁnd the hoop and
score the first two points in the con-
test, when Rosen made his two foul
shots good, Dr.‘ Carlson's protegcs
promptly hung an “out of order” sign
on the visitors’ basket which seemed
to have a good effect at frequent in-
tervals during the 40 minutes of play.

Small Crowd Attends

A small crowd of 1500 watched
Panther ﬁve forge to the front and
maintain a lead of between 10 and 15
points as the game progressed. Even
frequent replacements in the Owls
lineup by coach Usiltou failed to
check the force of the Panther attack.

It was not until more than seven
minutes of the first half had been
played did the visitors sink their first
ﬁeld goal through the cords. Brown.
eluding Smith and Wilson, tossed his
only two pointer of the contest and
the only one scored by the Owls dur-
ing the initial half, on an iiiideiuieatli
the basket shot. But his feat went
almost unnoticed and the scoreboard
showing Pitt ahead 14-5.

A scoreless period of three minutes,

followed this ﬁeld goal, and captain
Smith called time out for the Pan-
thers. The result was another scoring
spree with Mccamant and Ochsenhirt
collecting a pair of two I>0iI1t€1‘S and
putting the Panthers ahead 22-9‘ as
the gun went off to end the Initial
half. _
Cribbs Suffers ll‘l_jUl‘)’.

The second half was a repetition of
the first, the visitors unable to score
only through the personal foul route
until that period was almost half
over, This double pointer came with
the injection of Kilkuskie, replaciu:-2
Beron at guard for the Owls. Getting
three more ﬁeld goals and sinhiiig_:i

scoring during their stay on the IJ€1Vl1-
ion floor in scoring nine D01I1tS-

Mccamant was the Ilia-‘.11 scorer of
the evening with ﬁve ﬁeld g08_1S ‘-U}d
tour fouls for a total of 14 points in
the game.

The game, however. proved seine-
what costly for the Panther cohorts.

Harvard Easier Opponent

}il.:ll‘\‘3.I‘tl may prove a slightly’ less
spectacular opponent, but the Cam-
bridge pool is a ﬁfty yard tank which
will be an almost insurmountable
lhandicap to the Pitt boys.

Most of Pitt's stren;.3th will be cen-
tered in the 50 and ‘.220-yard freestyle
events. Paul Stiniier, if he is on, will
cover the short sprint in better than
25 seconds. Jack Denny has been

sliadiiig Hanna's old time for the 220
lately and should do that event under
two minutes and twenty-ﬁve seconds.
John Carik and Joe Sclinieiler will
dive for Pitt. Carik needn’t take sec-
ond place to some of the best divers
in the country while Schmeilcr is an
unlmowii quantity in diving competi-
tion though he did considerable div-
ing in high school.
Relay 400 Yards
Departing from the usual 160 or
200-yard relays this week’s meets call
for 400-yard relays. Pitt will be well

For All Classes

A freshman boxing touriiey that
received the hearty support of the
class of '35 last year proved the pop-
ularity of such a tourney, and with
the inclusion of sophomores, juniors,
and seniors in this year's tournament,
the success of the Intramurals seems
assured.

Last year’s bouts produced some
high grade boxing talent, many of
the winners being contestants for var-
sity berths this season. Vliinners of
last year's tourney were: 115-pound
class, Joseph Pace; 125-pound class,
Louis Leon; 135-pound. class, Billy
Ames 145-pound class, William
Schwimnier; 155-pound class, Anth-
ony Hornpeck; 165~pound class, Pete
Visat; 175-pound class, Pete Visat;
heavyweight class, Ed, Thompson.

comment of one returning veteran.

The editors‘ claim they tried their

the result of a psychological question-
l1a.ll‘e on the ﬁve qualities which‘ are
most attractive in the opposite sex.
l-‘ifty men and "ﬁfty girls on the

personalities of the opposite sex most
attractive to them, and the character-

committees have experienced on the campus so far? I-lave tl1e_v’rc-
sultcd from inefficient student administration and downright leth-
ai=gyion..thc part of the committee members, or have they come about
as 'i1ll(’,:'lIl8.V"ltEl‘.l')l€‘. res-ult of an ovcr—cxpandcd social program?

 are. inclined to believe that the latter is more than likely
the reason. Dance cha.irmen are as enthusiastic and their commit-
tee members are just as zealously intent on success today as they
were last year or ﬁve years ago. No, committees and their methods
lm.vcn’t changed much from year to year; but the conditions un.der
which they are expected to function have changed. In short, the
social program has grown, while the wealth of its student supporters
has decreased.

The time has come to decide just .how many major dances our
notably poor student body can stand. Can we afford to support ﬁve
major dances—-each of which is trying to out-do the otl1cr——-in only
six weeks of school? Judging from recent performances and the
outlook for the coming semester, we cannot. VVe shall record more
than one failure next sc1ncstcr—1u1less corrective steps are taken
immediately.

No amount of quibbling in Council sessions can serve to remove
the responsibility of-»suc.h—a.n »im'estigation from»Student-Relations
committee. It was for the solution of such problems as this that the
committee was intended; the investigation is a job worth their un-
(lertaking. Ilecoumlendations offered in time to beneﬁt the chair-
man of the Junior Prom, the next major dance, would prove the
committcc’s real value and perhaps provide the remedy for our so-
cial ills. ’ '

 A Cultural Program

- HAT students as well as facility are seeking to “stiinulate their

i.n.tell.ectual interests” of their own accord is seen in the recom-
mendation to Student Council that its members formulate and carry
into effect a deﬁnite “cultural program” for the undergraduate
body.

Coming from a student in the School of Mines, one of the scvc1_'al
divisions of the University in which. specialization. is necessarily
stressed, the recommendation is of particular sign'iﬁ.cancc. Repre-
sentative Curran, a senior mines student, apparently is concerned
over the fact that a student in any business, professional. or indus-
trial school learns much about his own subject but too little about
the other ﬁelds of study which draw his classmates.

That is a good sign. It indicates, for one thing, a. desire to ac-
quire knowledge other than that which is to be put to work for ma-
terial proﬁt. It is not beyond all reason that a. student in mechan-
ical engineering might like to have some knowledge of biology, the
arts of painting and sculpturing, economics, political science or so-
ciology. Nor is it unreasonable to suppose that a student of the
liberal arts school should desire to know more about the techno-
logical subjects and kindred sciences. _

The method b_v which such a cultural program might be carried
into effect is not so important as the endorsement that should be
forthcoming from the students it will beneﬁt. A tentative plan has
been suggested: that of having open forum meetings, at which prom-
inent. faculty members speak on the subjects of their study which
would be of general interest to students in all schools.

No better project could be undertaken by Council at this par-
ticular timc. It would be in accord with a growing feeling among
serious students that the time for intellectual growth is always
“now,” and that the problem of so developing is not one for the
classroom alone.

An Institution Passes

N INSTITUTION which for years occupied a position of import-
ance in the hearts and minds of Pitt students has passed out of

being. Changing times and lack of support have been offered as the
reasons for its withdrawal and the substitution of something new in
its place.

Promise of even greater offerings for students and faculty who,
throughout the years, have developed an almost passionate respect
for this institution of “bigger and better” entertainment come to us
now from anxious sponsors. They speak of “new policies . . . a new
deal.” But with the memories of the old so fresh in our minds, we
cannot hear of the new. Today we mourn that which is gone.

Perhaps, in time, a new Pitt tradition will grow up around the
new name. But until that time comes we shall feel keenly the pass-
ing of one of Pittsburgh '5 oldest theatrical institutions, unblushingly
identiﬁed as “the most important spoke in the wheel of burlesque.”

Although the default of France and
her diplomatic satellites on the war
debt payments due the United. States
on December 15 last has not --closed
this international question, it is cer-
tain that the public has by now be-
come pretty tired of the whole busi-
ness. That is the tragedy of it, as I
see it. The public has become tired
of a. matter of prime importance with-

lout ever having learned the’ history

or present set-up of it.

While this column makes no claims
to the inside track on information re-
garding war debts, the opinion frankly
and (I hope) forcefiilljv expressed
here has been that there 1nnst- soon
be a. revision of the funding agree-
ments of the early nineteen-twenties.
The “facts” that support this preju-
dice deserve, in »fairness to them, at
least a. brief airing.

Ten Billions Spent Here

The total amount borrowed from
the government of the United States
before and I-‘/flel‘ the Armistice was
ten and a third billions of dollars.
But contrary to the hazy opinions

transported bodily across the Atlantic,
That ten billion was spent in the
United States. ‘Large expenditures
for munitions, manufactures, and food
by the borrowing nations accounted
for the war prosperity that we ex-
perienced in those }'.9Tc11‘S. . __Our gold
supply did not decrease one cent‘s

In fact, it increased.

In considering the justness of any
debt, the rise or fall in price levels
between the time of borrowing and
the time of repayment, is of highest
importance. At the time of the Allied
borrowings, prices the world over
were about double what they are now.
-111 ot.her.words, Great Britain, in mak-
ing her payment. of December 15, 1932,
had to pay the United States two dol-
la.r’s worth of goods for‘ ‘every one
dollar's worth loaned her in 1918 (not
even considering the interest cliarges).
Th.is automatic doubling of the prin-
cipal to be paid back becomes genu-
inely appa-1ling_ in unfairness when the

four billion dollars, as it. does~1'n the
case of Great Britain.
_Depreciated Currency Abroad

To make the payments of these
debts even more diﬂicult, European
n:-itionspare now faced with depreci-
ated currencies.- For instance, if Eng-
land had been on the gold standard in
December, she would have transferred
twenty million pounds in gold to the
United States. But with the pound
quoted at about $3.31., she had, to pay
twenty-nine million, or an addition of
45 per cent. The hardship which is
thus worked upon nations struggling
along ﬁnancially without ‘.1 gold stand-
ard should be obvious.
liefore the December 15th pay-
ments, Europe had. paid back a total
of $2,628,000,0,00_ For the,,future, we
must realize, it we are to deal with
this matter rcalisticvally, that the
methods by which these payments
were made have disappeared. In
other words, there will be no way for
Europe to pay us. During the pros-
perous twenties American tourists
spent. many millions in Europe every
year (more than 600 million dollars in
1929); we were paid back in that way.
But Americans have given up touring
of late. And few expect to have
money to do 21.113’ for many years to
come.
Immigrants
used to send 200 millions home annu-
a.ll.y. But immigration has declined,
and has recently r.-‘ome to u comlllete
stop. That is another means of re-
payment removed. A very great item
before the crash was the American
investments abroad. These have de-
clined with little chance for revival.
Other than the three methods men-
tioned, there is pruct.ica,ily no way for
European or any other nations to get
a credit surplus in the United States;
for we have exported more goods than
we have imported every year since
the end of the VVorld ‘War.

How Can Europe Pay?

How, then. are our European
debtors going to» pay us what they

,owe‘.' So far as I know, a sensible
,answer to that question is yet to
,_come from the headquarters of the
ipatriotic anti-revisionists and anti-
_ cztucellationists.
 Of course, there are at good "many
{theories of how Europe could pay us.
{But they are little more than theories.
"Perhaps the favorite one is that
jgFrancc, Great Britain, and other
ldebtors could present us with some
lot‘ their “valuable” colonies. At the
sllresent time we own :1 white ele-
phant in the Paciﬁc called the Phil-
gippine Islands, which we have been
{trying to get rid of for years. I
ihardly think that we want any more
like it.
i The plain truth is that eolo-nies are
{and always ha.ve_been liabilities. It
»costs money to administrate and pro-
.vide military protection for them,
lThe natives continually embarrass
}the home government ‘by staging
grevolutions. Disputes with other
world powers over, bound-ariestand
t1'a.de privileges are without end.
VV11z'-it would happen if Great Bri-
tain presented us with Bermuda‘?
The government would not conﬁscate
the private property on the island, I
hope. The government would not levy
unjustly heavy taxes, I hope. The
prestige that would go with the own-
ership would hardly put ten billion
dol_1a_irs in the Federal treasur,v. The
government of the United States
would not beneﬁt one nicke1's worth
by the possession of Bermuda or any
other colony, whether it be a winter
_,resort..or 3. source of raw material for
,American industry.
1 Huge Interest Charges
5 It should not be overlooked that the
funding agreements provide. for the
payoff over El. period of 62 years.
Mounting interest charges covering
that time swell the original principal
to 21 total of both principal and inter-
est to some 22 billionsof dollars. In
the case of Great Britain, she bor-
rowed four and a quarter billions. and
must pay back eleven and a. half bil-
lions (not considering the
due to aﬁfalling price level). The
same proportions are true of France
and Italy. -
It is at this principle ofhuge inter-

debtor nations have balked. They re-
.-gard it as unfair. To strengthen their
arguments for revision, they point to
the shaky ﬁnancial structure which
they and the United States set up
after the war. They are willing to set
aside the _Versailles agreements, for
they see that nothing can be got by
the continued bleeding of Germany by
repa.ra.tions which in turn are the
foundations of the war debt payments.
The Cancellation Argument

from a debtor naturally
tionable. But cancellationists on this
side of the Atlantic point out that it
is to the distinct advantage of the
United States to forget war debt pay-
ments.

The recovery of normal business
would be worth far more to us than
.the money.-. we iniglilpcollect. «And as
lfor the actual dollars involved, the
‘custom duties of the yeiir 1925 (a year
of simple, non-boom prosperity) col-
lected over a. period of forty years
would pay the total amount with a
million or so left over.

‘We haven't everything to lose in
this war debt géune by giving our
debtors a. square deal.

“The Mummy”--Warner

“The Mummy,” Hol1ywood’s latest

plenty of shivers to Warner Theater
audiences. Boris Karloff's uncanny
portrayal of the mummiﬁed Imhotep.
a 3000-year-old priest brought _mira.cu-

best work he has done since “Frank-

Karloff grabs hold of your interest
from the time you first catch sight of
him until the very end when his body
crumbles. Imhotcp, we learn, meets-

To the Editor, Pitt News:

 If therewas ever a proposedidea
that fo.u.11d-welcomed response in all

factlons of the student body at the
University, it is the plan to set aside
the ﬁfth hour of the official lunch
period. In its last issue, The Pitt
News made the ﬁrst public statement
in hearty favor of the idea. Yet, to
show the wide dissemination of the
plan, at the very time that the editor
was probably writing the editorial,
last Thursday night, the Interfrutcr
nity Council unanimously voted to
recommend the “abolishing of the fifth
hour as a study hour,” for this pur-
pose. ,

The Council was quick to see its
own particular advantages in the
plan. They saw in it the long-awaited
opportunity for a more frequent gen-
fraters.
The city men, now forced to lunch at
different hours by their schedule and
so only meeting as a. body with the
house men on meeting nights, would
be given more occasions for general
association. Greater fraternalism
would hence be made possible. It
would also mean additional income
for the fraternity kitchen, that would
otherwise flow into other channels.

But, more particularly, the Council
saw the larger and more wide-reaclr
ing advantage of the plan to the en-
tire student body and to the Univer-
sity itself. '

They saw in the plan 21 corrective
measure for schedules that precluded

the proper lunch hour, particu1arl,v
theblock schedules that are prepared
for the Engineers, Pre-Dents and
Pre-Meds and which do not provide
for sufficient opportunity for lunch.
Such a plan, then, would remove a
detriment to the health of the stu-
dents. The proposed lunch hour
would also -provide social opportuni-
ties; campus clubs would be thus giv-
en a meeting time, as well as would
cX:tra-curricular activities.
The University would proﬁt by this
idea as much as the students. At
present there is lacking a. common
time for socializing and group activity.
This would help build the lukewarm
school consciousness and spirit on the
part of the students. Most universi-
ties have a common lunch hour. The
Dental School, known "to possess the
bestspirit of all campus schools, has
already established a lunch hour.
..'I‘-he happy feature of the whole
idea is that the good in it is so pre-
dominant and the bad results are al-
most negative. It is hardly necessary
to debate the matter at length. If
all the schools and campus units
would simply make known their ap-
proval, the University authorities, al-
ways ready to make a change where
a change is felt needed, would effect
the revision of the schedule.
Interfraternity Council takes this
opportunity to commend the News for
the activly intelligent part it is play-
ing in publicizing campus needs.
