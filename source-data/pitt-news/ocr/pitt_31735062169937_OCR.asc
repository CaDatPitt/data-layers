‘Concerned’
To Meet
Tuesday

A meeting will be held _tomor-
row at noon.

Last Thursday at a meeting of
student leaders with Chancellor
Posvar and William Rea. chair-
man of the Board of Trustees. a
discussion of the Concerned Stu-
dents and Faculty‘s request for an
open meeting with the Trustees
ended in deadlock.

ty feel that an open meeting with
the Trustees is essential in creat-
ing the proper atmosphere for the
operation of a free university. Be-
cause we have effectively been
denied such an open meeting.

Speakers Present Challenge

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

Almost 300 high school students
filed into the auditorium of the
Common Facilities Building Sat-
urday morning to hear Paul Stol-
ler. Pitt News editor. and Merle
Polls. WJAS broadcaster.

The event was the annual high
school newspaper clinic spon-
sored by the Pitt News and the
Office of Student Publications.
The high school reporters were
invited to a double lecture by
Stoller and Pollis and to work-
shops for the rest of the morning.

Stoller presented his young au-
dience with a challenge. “You
have to open your eyes, and look

introspectively into yourselves,"

he said.
Like the Greek myth of Sisy-

phia, who had to roll a rock up a
mountain only to" have it perpet-
ually roll down again during his
whole life, “most high school

that you do is meaningless,” Stol- '

main. said the speaker. “Two re-
sults of this is that the whole area
of sex is very ambiguous and it
has caused a lot of pathology." he
continued.

Dr. Neubeck suggested that if
we‘ can get over our hang-ups_
about words which refer to sex and
the sexual organs; perhaps we can
remove some of the internal in-
hibitions as well. He tried an ex-
periment with the audience. at-
temping to "desensitize“ the 200
present. '

He asked the predominantly fe-
male audience to repeat with him
and their neighbors several words
which have been avoided because
of their obvious connection with
sex. In turn. Dr. Neubeck chant-
ed "belly." “nipples." “foreskin"
and "vagina“ and challenged those
present to either say them with
him or leave if anyone felt embar-
rassed.

"You have to learn to desensitize
yourselves." insisted the doctor.

Women,'who insist on love for
sex, may have gone too far in this
direction. “For girls, sex must be
of the highest order. This is not
true of other things, ‘like eating
and talking. Why not ‘hamburger
sex,’ instead of alway ‘steak sex,’
_q_ueried the lecturer.

Merle Pollis carried a similar

 What’s Right?

enio Speaks
On Dictatorship

by ALLAN SENIO
Project Headstart, an Office of Economic Opportunity creation.
was a major step toward total government control of our youth.

Much has been said by many in favor of local control of public
schools. Headstart schools are federal schools in the strictest meaning
of the word. The parents certainly have no say about Headstart. They

 are the ones who are said to have deprived the children in’ the first

place. What three-and-four-year-olds learn is absolutely up to federal
’ bureaucrats. -

I question the government's right to determine exactly what sort
of culture a child should have. I though that it was only the Soviet

2  . Communists who separated parent and child at an early age, in order

to fill the child’s head with the “culture" of the police state. None of
our recent totalitarian regimes could have been successful without

‘ ' r such governmental agencies as Headstart.

THERE IS NO use dodging the issue, Headstart is intrinsically
linked to the Negro and his children. White America bought and pay-

ed for the program, which was supposed to graft some culture onto lit— j

tle Negro children. The more militant and thinking Blacks were pro-
foundly insulted by this effrontery.

Much of the Black community has woken up and sees Headstart
for -what it is, an outright attempt to substitute a government culture
for that of the parent. White America may not wake up in time. As
long as someone else's kids are being tampered with, the suburbanite
couldn’t give a darn. These trusting souls are forgetting that America
is run on precedent. If the federal government can alienate Black

youngsters from their natural culture. in a few years the government

will assume ipso facto, the power to subject all children to federal en-

jculturation.

On page 103 of Educational Psychology (Gibson) it is revealed

. that no long term evidence has been found showing that Headstart af-

fects school achievement. The power grabbers who concocted the

 scheme knew in advance that it wouldn’t work. The whole garbage

pail was merely a ploy, a tactic to get the kids‘ away from their par-
ents and into the eager hands of enterprising Fascists.

DO YOU WANT your kids to be tomorrow’s Red Guards? If this
is to be prevented we must get the federal government out of the ed-
ucation business. Our Constitution prohibits federal interference in

. education of any sort. The framers realized the parent’s God-given

right to educate his child as he saw fit. America’s children are being

, Sovietized! We must stop the treachery, and to this end I suggest re-
‘  peal of the Income Tax. This would deprive our rulers of all those “car-

rots.” Whe American parents accept the “carrot of “federal aid to ed-
ucation” America’s children get the stick. What is the stick? Brain-
washing, militarism, and slavery.

, On Police War

"At the very base of our American freedom is the institution known
as the local police. It is an American idea that law enforcement over
the people should be close to and responsible to the people. Localized
law enforcement is the exact opposite of the brandof law and and or-
der which has been imposed on the Soviet countries. These regimes
all have centralized, highly efficient Gestapos to manage the subjects
of the state. Our local police are our friends and neighbors‘. they know
the specific problems peculiar to our neighborhoods. That is why they.
and not the agents of some far removed central authority. should be
enforcing our laws. No tyranny in previous history has depended on
local police forces to solidify its control. In 1984 ever comes to the
USA, it won’t be a local policeman who [packs you off to a detention
camp. A local policeman wouldn’t do it for the same reasons that
Hungarian troops were not used to put down the 1957 uprising. Goons
were imported from Mongolia to carry out the butchery. An absolute
requirement for any dictatorship is a centralized police force which
will enforce law and order as murderously as their superiors comand.

There is a concerted attack being made to day on our local police.
The news media is leading us to believe that our cops are sadistic ra-
cists who should be replaced by a better “regulated” Constabulary.
Both major parties had in their platforms, proposals to aid (eventually
control) local police forces. The Omnibus Crime Bill has given the
federal government the means to absorb into a national KGB. all of
our police forces. '

' At the Democratic convention we saw the most glaring example
of the press seeking to discredit the police. The Communist—led crim-
inals who brought organized terror to Chicago were classified as in-
nocent “youngsters," by the TV and press establishment. The pelting
of police with human excrement and urine was not shown on the‘Boob
Tube. We didn’t see the “kids” throwing rocks, bottles and lye at po-
lice either. What we saw was the phony police brutality which some:
one wanted to see. Someone created a situation so threatening to the
people of Chicago and the delegates at the convention, that the police
were forced to use mace and billy clubs. These “someone‘s“ want us
to lose faith in our police, refuse to support them, and resist them vio-
lently. When the citizens of this country are no longer ready to pro-
tect their neighborhood police forces, the police forces will find it im-
possible to protect America.

AT THIS MOMENT the Pittsburgh police are the only barrier
between you and the two biggest threats to your life and freedom: the

A violent mobs always ready to kill and rob, and your own government,‘

which if allowed will clap you into slavery. If that fact bothers you
then do something to support those cops and make that barrier strong-
er. Resist any attempt to make of our police anything less than inde-

   

  
     

    

Editor. Pitt News,

I read in the Pitt News (front
page, Feb. 12) that certain stu-
dents werevdemanding court in-
junction and public exposure of
the “FBI Informer." Why all this
fuss? Is it such a crime to work
for your government?

I understand that some students
don't like our form of government.
I’ll not condemn them for that:
they have a right to their opin-
ions. But why do they condemn
the “Informer“ merely because
he liked our form of government
and supported it? Everyone has
the right to legally act against
that which they believe is detri-
mental to their country’s good.
plus the right to say what they
want to say, to whom they wish
to say it. It’s just a different opin-
ion and he has the “right of opin-
ion" like everyone else . . . does-
n’t be?

Why‘ must people persist in‘
claiming their own rights with-‘

out granting ‘them to others? This
is hypocrisy and selfishness! Do
they really have the right to force
their will upon others? That's sel-
fish. so I don’t think so. The hypo-
crites certainly don't recognize
that right in others. It’s human
nature to be selfish. I’m selfish.
but I make a conscious effort not
to be. I pray more people would
do the same.

I ’m A Loser

Editor. The Pitt News,

I’m not exactly sure why I’m
writing this letter. I suppose it is
because when I feel something
strongly I like to put it into words.
My first two years at this school
were spent doing things that I
thought were the important phases
of college life — dating, joining
fraternity. watching Pitt football
games. This year started off_ the
same way. And then something
happened.

I began to wonder, where's it
all at. Why am I getting up for
an early class that holds no inter-
est for me at all? Why don’t I
have anything to say when some-
one brings up the ROTC? Why
do I listen to the bias crap in the
Pittsburgh Press about the "reb-
els“ at Columbia? What the hell
is going on?

And then came a turning point.
I was walking to my 12 o'clock
class on Friday. Feb. 7. when I
saw a huge gathering of students

_ in the Commons ...Room. They

were there to make demands of
the administration. demands
which I knew nothing about. I
made a quick decision — this was
a way to find out where it‘s at:
the hell with my class. It was a
good decision. For two hours that
Friday and another two on Mon-
day in the Common Facilities
building I found out a lot about
where it's all at. I saw the Chan-

cellor continuously avoid the is— '

sues presented to him. I heard
student demands that made such
damn good sense avoided by the
administration. I listened to Dr.
Posvar say that Senator Fleming's
bill would never pass and the fol-
lowing weekil learned that 41 of
43 legislators on the floor would
support it. \

Somehow it is all a big dream.
How have I been so stupid for so
long? Why didn't I get involved
a long time ago? There is a lot
happening on this campus and I
think that I. am an example of
what that happening is. There
will always be the students on
campus who will ask important

"  ‘@iu{<2stioI‘S‘ fliké  (those  that r J “  "

 

I that its meaning was distorted en-
important_ thing is that I. and tire1_v_
many others like me, have awaken-
ed to it all. It makes me just a lit-

tle prouder to be at this school.

in such an abbreviated version

Drafty Registrars Office

Editor. The Pitt News,

I am very angry about the lazy indifference I received f'rom the
registrar's office in recent attempts to communicate with my draft
board. Before the start of the fall term'I filled out the appropriate
card which the university uses to convey student status to the local
boards, and set it in with the registration kit-.

Weeks and months passed, and I did not receive my deferment.
During finals week I was told I was 1-A. Fit to be tied. I went to the
registrar‘s office to investigate the matter. Someone told me I had not
indicated the address of my local board on the white card. Therefore.
they could not communicate with mylocal draft board. So I gave them
the address, and they told.-myjdraft board. I was fortunate that the
draft board received the certification as they were about to have their
monthly meeting. I got the deferment two weeks later.

The registrar's office could have at least had the courtesy to in-
form me of my supposed error. Instead they ignored it. and I had no
knowledge of what was going on. Something must be done to im-
prove the communications between the students, the registrar. and the
draft boards. A student should not have to put up with such an in-
different attitude from an office of this University particularly on
such a vital matter as the draft. ‘ A

Sargent Strikes Again

Editor. The Pitt News,

The current set of student “demands” (when, I wonder, did some-
one last request something?) will tend to confirm a theory‘ that many
have held for some time, to wit: that there are people in universities
who do not belong there.

Editing is your duty and priv-
ilege as an editor;

By this practice. you have pre-
sented to your readers a complete-
ly one-sided approach to the ques-

nalistic fairness only if you per-
mit a full presentation of the op-
posite point of view".
G.1P. Schuck-Kolben
Lecturer

To judge from their freely expressed and very general dissatisfac-
tion. no one knows this better than themselves.

A person who does not want to attend lectures. who balks at learn-
ing facts. who resents writing examinations. who dreads having the

. quality of his work and thought graded or otherwise ‘evaluated, who

does not want to follow any set curriculum. who rejects course re-
quirements and required courses on principle, who prefers his own
opinions and interpretations, however untutored,_ to those of scholars
who have given decades of study to their discipline—such a person is
simply not at home in an academic environment.

He will not profit from it. and it will decidely not profit from him.

For those who want a completely unstructured learning experi-
ence. free from the slightest trace of regimentation. from requirements_,_
examinations, grades. and the rest; and who want it now, here is a
word of cheer.

There is an institution. presently in existence, designed to cater
to their taste.

It is to be found in the city of Pittsburgh.
Iit is called the public library. -
It is free to all, courtesy of the taxpayers.

Thereone can study what one likes. when and as one likes. The
only rule is that books, if taken out, must be returned in a reasonable
time'and,i,n good condition.

. Thedisadvantage of transferring from the. university to theipublic
libr-ary isthat thosegwho took the step would no longer be able to call
themselves students in the formal sense.

They would. however, have the satisfaction of knowing that they
were being honest. since to style oneself a student without acting like

Reacting Without Knowing

BAS Not Understood Here

by ELINOR SCHERL
and SHARON NELSON
Contributing Writers

The black student occupation
of the Computer Center was a
tense moment for this campus.
There were groups of white stu-
dents who reacted violently to
black actions. But. as the results
of the Process '69 survey of black-
white relations show they react-
ed without knowledge and clear
understanding of what black stu-
dents were really seeking.

Only six weeks before. 54 per
cent of'the students polled had
not even heard of the Black Ac-
tion Society TBAS). Another 31
per cent had heard of the BAS but
did not feel they knew its goals.
This means 85 per cent of the stu-
dents polled had a limited under-
standing of the organization rep-
resenting black students on cam-
pus. Many students expressing ap-
proval or disapproval had to qual-
ify their answers. mentioning that
they approved or disapproved
only if their perception of the
BAS was correct.

This lack of understanding and.

unawareness of the black-white
situation pervades the thinking
and answers of most of the stu-
-dents polled. In reference to all
black houses in the dormitories.
65.53 per cent were against the
idea.

By saying that all black hous-
ing would defeat the purpose of
integration, many students show-
ed that they did not understand
the difference between true inte-
gration and the token inclusion of

Applications
For Mentor

Available

Men and women students who
wish to apply for mentor may
pick up applications in 1209 Ca-
thedral. The applications are due
Wednesday. ‘

According to reports from the
mentor evaluation committee.
this year’s mentors program will
be a co-ed program. Incorporated
into the program will be a co-ed
training session at Camp Kon—o-
Kwee over the Labor Day week-
end.

“It was the consensus of the
evaluation committee, which be-
gan meeting last year, to have a
co-ed program since the Dean of
Students office is co-ed. The de-
cision was made last week. Men
mentors will have freshmen men
in the group and women will have
women, but they will work to-
gether and have joint meetings
whenever they choose,” com-
mented a committee spokesman.

There has also been a change
in the selection process for the
mentors this year. Two senior stu-
dents and one staff member will
moderate group interviewing ses-
sions. .

All applicants for mentor must
have an overall QPA of 2.0 and
must have completed 60 credits
by the fall term. 1969.

blacks in a white situation. They
were also ignoring the prejudice
that black students meet daily,
living in predominantly ’ white
dorms.

This lack of understanding is
also evident in the overwhelming
response that Pitt should not, in
any way alter admission stan-
dards for blacks. This attidude
shows a failure to recognize the
University's responsibility to con-
tribute significantly to the solu-
tion of problems in the society
around it.

The black student who cannot
meet the requirements is often a
product of the inferior school so-
cieyt has provided for him. There-
fore. in a society that places in-
creasing emphasis on higher edu-
cation, it is the responsibility of
the University to provide him
with the opportunity to overcome
this disadvantage. -

Again this lack of understand-
ing becomes apparent when stu-
dents were asked to define the
role of the white man in today’s
society. WNear1y one-half of the
students polled said that the white

_man should work in the black

community. This attitude runs
counter to the growing awareness
among blacks (and among some
whites) that black communities
must be freed of white influence
and control at all levels, and hides
the underlying feeling that white

presence is necessary for suc-
cess in any situation.

Forty-nine per cent of those .

polled said the white man should
help in the white community. but
the comments of many indicated
that they failed to see the need to
combat racism in their own com-
munity and merely reflected a re-
action to not being wanted by
blacks.

When confronted with the ques-
tion of what black people want
more than 80 per cent adhered to
such ideas as equality, identity
opportunity, and pride. These are
general principles easily espous-

ed. However, the previous data

shows that people are a great deal
more cautious when they are
questioned about a specific situa-
tion that affects them on a per-
sonal level.

Until the individual -sees and un-
derstands how each aspect of the
black-white problem relates to
him personally and how it will af-
fect his life, the misunderstand’-
ing will continue. The individual
can go along with vague general
precepts until he is personally
confronted. Then he is forced to
respond and too often he only re-
acts.

couple‘ of bumping incidents
proved costly to Jim Banner’s
thinclads in the 48th annual
IC4A meet in New York City's
Madison Square Garden Saturday.

The collision that hurt the
squad more than anything in
the classic came in the 600-yd.
trials. Smitty Brown turned
in the fourth best qualifying
time (12125) in the field, but the
incident kept him out of the
finals. Smitty was pushed
and was forced to reach his hand

runnertand was disqualified.

.“It was just one of those judg-
ments.”' Banner said. “I would
have liked to see him in the
finals. He could have given us a
real good place."

Smitty would have had _ to 1

come up with -a great perfor-
mance to win. if he could have
gone to the championship chase.
Villanova’s Olympian, Larry
James, won the race with a 1:09.2
clocking, setting the IC4A mark
in the event. '

The other contact resulted in.a

‘ sixthplace finish for the fresh-

man madley relay team. Dorel

of his hands early in the race.

seconds. The squad finished the
chase in 8:15. as the -Wildcats
from Villanova hit the tape first.

That was something Villanova
did quite often in the meet. They"
won their tenth IC4A title with
ease, despite the fact that they
didn’t enter a single man in the

BRYANT SALTER CLEARING THE HEIGHTS AS HE DID IN THE NE-W Madi-

son Square Garden against the best in the East. Salter leaped 66’ 8"

again and was bested only by West Chester's Lonnie Dalton (6’9’’).
4 Salter settled for a fifth place finish due to the number of misses.

Banner isn’t sure where his
tracksters finished, “something
like 9th,” he mentioned. They
might have been a little higher
if the varsity mile relay team
could have been just a little bit
faster. Villanova (3:l8.7), and
Army (3:18.9) barely beat the
quartet in the race. They clocked
in at 3:19.

‘-‘It was probably the most ex-
citing race inthe m'eet_,” Banner
stated.

There was only one other event
that the tracksters came close to
claiming. That was the high
jump, an event that once again
say Bryant Salter clear 6’8”. His
leap was only good enough for
fifth place. but success at a
slightly higher height could have
meant victory. Salter was tied
with five jumpers, placing fifth
becauseof his misses. The win-
ner. Lonnie Dalton of West Ches-

ter State. took honors with a 6’9’_

‘There was disappointment for
Banner in the mile race. His
star, Jerry Richey, ran a 4:12 in

the trials, a time that wasn’t _

good enough to make the finals.

“He just didn‘t run an intelli-

did everything wrong."

R The other thinclads’ in the
meet were Greg Ellis and Mark
Vornhagen. Ellis finished
- eighth in the shot put (52’ 10")
and Vornhagen ran a 9:12 two-
mile, grabbing second in his
heat. Harvard’s,Dick Benka won
