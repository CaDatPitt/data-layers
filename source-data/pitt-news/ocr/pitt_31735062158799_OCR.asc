 Learns Why It Has it

“Student’ vs ‘Athlete’

Wherein Oxford

Never Met Pitt Men

By SIDNEY SHORE

Today, as it must in every
volume of The News, the an-
nual Rhodes Scholarship story
appears.

Since 1903, the Rhodes trus-
tees in England have been assign-
ing 32 scholarships annually in
the United States, and in all that
time no University of Pittsburgh

.student has received the award. In

fact, only two have ever been in-
vited by the Philadelphia commit-
tee for consideration.

There must be a pretty good
reason why a school of Pitt’s
standing and size should be unable
to obtain even one out of 1,056
scholarships.

Basis of selection is made on
“literary and scholastic ability
and attainments; qualities of
manhood, truth, courage, devo-
tion to duty, sympathy, kindness,
unselﬁshness, and fellowship; ex-
hibition of moral force of charac-
ter and of instincts to lead and to
take an interest in his school-
mates; and physical vigour, as
shown by interests in outdoor

.sports or in other ways.”

One of the two named to appear
before the committee for ﬁnal se-
lection was John Tibby, former
-editor of The News. Tibby, who
led his class in literary and schol-
astic attainments, in leadership,
and in force of character, did not
display, in the judges’ opinions,
“physical vigour, as shown by in-
terests in outdoor sports.”

  

“Physical vigour” means a post
on the one of the athletic teams.
According to recent poll results, it
would seem that participation of
“students” on varsity teams are
not to be encouraged at metropoli-
tan universities who must keep an
eye to gate receipts. Perhaps
“students” cannot win Rose Bowl
classics.

Meanwhile Swarthmore and
Haverford, whose athletes don’t
rate sport page columns, are win-
ning Rhodes awards. These two
colleges have built up a reputation
for scholarship and use athletics
to round out the students’ curri-
cula.

Of course apologists can hide
behind a sad tale of “specializa-
tion.” University men are encour-
aged to center their abilities in
one" activity. As far as athletics
go, even the super-student, worthy
of Rhodes sholarships, cannot
hope to compete with the “ama-
teurs” on varsity squads. Most of
the athletics they can indulge in
must be in freshman physical ed-
ucation classes. After all, mort-
gages can’t be paid off in scholar-
ship awards.

In the scholarship competition,
the University must compete with
the eastern colleges of New York
and New Jersey. But then, so do
Swarthmore and Haverford.

Still, if the University is inter-
ested in gaining the distinction of
such an award, it might import
athletes of Phi Beta Kappa rank-
ing; or encourage the Rhodes com-
mittee to change the qualiﬁcations
to meet an age of specialization;
or, what is still more improbable,
bring athletics down to the level
of the student.

Spanish Division
Given High Rating

Indications that the Spanish di-
vision of the department of mod-
ern languages of the University is
gaining in national prominence is
evidenced by the fact that the
Educational Department of Cos-
mopolitan magazine recently rated
it as one of the ﬁnest of its kind
in answerto an inquiry submitted
by one of its readers regarding
Spanish divisions in the graduate
schools of the country.

Cheering
Block Goes

Into Action

First Performance

Scheduled
For Duke Game
The University’s cheering

block of 800 students will add
its share of color and spirit to
the Duquesne game Saturday
with at least seven different
demonstrations, some of which will

be ﬁlmed between the halves, it
was announced yesterday.

Included in the demonstra-
tions are a blue “P” on a gold
background, a spinning “P” on
blue, blue “D,” gold “D,” and
probably a gold panther head on
blue. Students in the section wﬂl
wear blue and gold reversible
jackets and caps. I

Members of the block rehearsed
in the stadium Tuesday afternoon,
getting into form for the Du-
quesne game.

There are still a few vacancies
in the block, according to D. C.
Schultz, BA38, and Bernard Mc-
Kenna, C39, who announced that
they will be glad to accept some
more applicants. Students inter-
ested should inquire at the office
of the dean of men.

The demonstration block, which
made its inaugural appearance at
the Duquesne game last season, is
an innovation of eastern football,
according to T. W. Biddle, assist-
ant dean of men and faculty spon-
sor of the project. The block was
organized last year under the
leadership of Louis Bearer, E37,
and is sponsored by SFA.

Panther
Wants New
Material

Following the trend of college
publications away from gags and
puns and “pure funny stuﬁ,” the
next edition of the Panther will
carry short stories and light verse,
announces Tom Smith, C39, editor
of the publication.

Calling for material for the
next issue, deadline for which is
Monday, Smith said that he was
looking for “light stuff with a
punch, but not necessarily hu-
morous.”

Short stories, verse, sports arti-
cles, and other things of general
interest will be included in the
new scope of the Panther. This
of course, is in addition to the
gags, puns, variegated jokes,
sports reviews, campus personali-
ties, and other features of the
magazine.

But the Panther isn’t trans-
gressing on the bounds of the
Journeyman, Smith pointed out.
“We’re not interested in any epics
or ‘more literary stuff’.” But, on
the other hand, the stories need
not necessarily be humorous.
What they must have is general
interest.

Director Cass

Selects Cast

For ‘Fields’
Novello Play

To Be Performed
On Foster Stage

Director Carl B. Cass today
announced the cast’ for the ini-
tial Pitt Players show of the

year, “Fresh Fields.” The
Ivor Novello play will be the
Players’ premier vehicle in the
new Player's theater, the Foster
Memorial theater, November 2, 3,
and 4.

Veteran actors dominate the
cast. Helen Akerman, C38, who
performed in last year’s “Cock
Robin” and “A Square Peg,” plays
the role of Lady Mary. A
companion lead role, Lady Lillian,
is being handled by Ione Williams,
C38, who is remembered as the
vivacious secretary in “Goodbye
Again.”

The male lead, Tom, a‘ good-
natured Australian who disrupts
the English background of the
play, has been asigned to William
Kunkel, BA39. Wﬂ_1iam'-~Hoeve1-
er, C39, is teamed with Phyllis
Post, Ed39, a newcomer, in the
romantic roles.

Rex Loder, C40, who made his
debut as a freshman in the “First
Mrs. Frasier,” will perform as
Ludlow, a comic butler. Shirley
Rugh, Ed38, a veteran, will play
Lady Strawholm, while Elizabeth
Moulton, Ed39, and ‘Heberta
Webb, Ed39, will be making their
debut in “Fresh Fields” as Miss
Swain’s secretary and Mrs. Pidg-
eon respectively.

Dnfdlzifgﬁ
Will Speak
At Inquiry

Causes of the Sino-Japanese
war will be discussed at Inquiry
Forum Monday at 2:30 o’clock in
24 Cathedral by Dr. Tin Chi, Chi-
nese economist and writer.

Dr. Chi, an instructor in the
New School for Social Research in
New York, has specialized in the
study of Far Eastern economic
problems. He is editor of Amer-
Asia, and a contributor to other
publications dealing with the Ori-
ent.

As a student of economic and
political conditions, Dr. Chi
worked in Europe for three years.
He was Chinese delegate to the
Yosemite conference of the Insti-
tution on Paciﬁc Relations last
year.

He also has been scheduled to
address Pittsburgh Community
Forum, meeting Monday evening
at 8:15 o’clock in the Schenley
high school auditorium. At that
time, he will speak on “War in
the Far East.”

Sessions of Inquiry Forum,
sponsored by the YM-YWCA, are
divided into two parts. In the
ﬁrst half of the hour, the speaker
presents his viewpoint; members
of the audience question him for
the remainder of the period.

SFA To Institute

New Committees

' At the next meeting-of the SFA
executive -committee, scheduled
for Tuesday afternon, four new
committees will be formed-. The
new committees will be put in
charge of assemblies, building and
grounds, Phi Beta Kappa investi-
gation, and Scholar’s Day.

All students interested in serv-
ing on these committees should
present their applications at the
dean of men’s office, 801 Cathe-

dral.

The Bluff athletes
are as optimistic as a seed cata-
log. And their optimism is not un-
founded.

The Bluffmen are just as big
and daring, and more polished
than they were last October, and
they have spirit to spare. Sturdy
linesmen and shifty backs com-
prise an explosive that can go off
and do plenty of damage at any
time. The Hilltop gridders know
how to make the most of their
breaks.

Trade Index

Indicates
Decline

There was a pronounced drop
in the level of business activity in
the Pittsburgh district last week,
according to the University Bu-
rau of Business Research. The
Bureau’s general index shows that
business slumped from 120.2 per-
cent of the 1923-25 average in the
week ended September 18, to 116.1
per cent last week, or more than
four points.

This decline resulted primarily
from the decided curtailment of
industrial production, although
the adjusted index of trade ad-
vanced to the highest level since
the ﬁnal week in February. Most
of the decrease in the volume of
production last week was due to
the large counter-seasonal decline
in the operating rate of the iron
and steel industry.

Bituminous coal production also
decreased, but industrial electric
power rose slightly more than
seasonally. The adjusted index
of originating shipments fell more
than four points last week, traffic
declining appreciably on both the
rivers and the railroads.

 

Freshman Debating

Subject- Announced ‘

Charles VV. Lomas, director of
the Men’s Debating Association,
has announced that the freshman
squad will meet once a week, on
Tuesdays at 3:30 o’clock, in 1617
Cathedral.

At the ﬁrst meeting 24 candi-
dates were present. The question
which will be used for the early
part of the school year is the na-
tional high-school one, “Resolved:
That the several states will adopt

Rome Makes
Owl Staff
Appointments

Seven Comprise
Editorial Board
For Year Book

Appointments to the editorial
and business staffs of The 1938
Owl were announced yesterday
by Idella Rome, Ed38, editor,
and Sam Werlinich, BA38,
business manager.

Supervising Owl editorial poli-
cies will be an editorial board of
seven members, working under
Miss Rome’s direction. Board
members will be assigned to spec-
ialized duties as soon as the or-
ganization work has been com-
pleted, Miss Rome says.

Members of the editorial board
are D. C. Schultz, BA38; Jackson
Sigmon, BA38; Harold Viehman,
C39; J. Ford Roche, C38; Dan
Lichtenstein, BA39; Ruth Custer,
C39, women’s editor; and Austin
Hay, C38, photography editor.

Named by Werlinich, Owl busi-
ness staff heads are Al Kairys,
BA39; Dick Frankel, BA39; Bill
Kunkel, C39; and Walter Kirk-
wood, BA39.

Other assistants named to the
staff are Phil Yaney, C39, as-
sistant photography editor, and
Ruth Tracht, Ed38, stenography
head. Additional members of the
editorial and business department
make a total of 60 staff members.

Most pressing problem before
the staff at present says Werlinich,
is that of getting the senior pic-
tures taken. Seniors may have
their pictures taken now in the
Photo-Reflex studios at Gimbel’s.
Deadline for senior pictures is
Monday, October 25.

“But don’t wait till the dead-
line,” warns Werlinich. “The
sooner students get their pictures
taken, the more time the photog-
rapher will be able to give each
one. Those who have already re-
ceived proofs have been very fa-
vorably impressed with the stu-
di0’s work.”

Princeton
Physicist
Lectures Here

Dr. Edward U. Condon, nation-
ally famous physicist of Princeton
university, is offering a course in
“The Introduction to Quantum
Mechanics” at the University
this War.

Writing in collaboration with
Dr. Phillip M. Morse of Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, Dr.
Condon is the authorof one of the
ﬁrst‘ books describing the appli-
cation of the new quantum me-
chanics to the stucture of ‘the
atom. He has recently‘ ﬁnished
writing a 500-page Cambridge
Press monographon “The Theory
of Spectra.” '

He is also editor of the Physics
Series of textbooks published by
Prentice-Hall, Inc., and is the au-
thor of numerous scientiﬁc arti-
cles. He is perhaps best known
for the Franck-Condon principle
which explains in simple language
which electronic transitions are
most probable in diatomic mole-
cules. .,

Economist
Addresses
SFA Forum

Dr. Daugherty
Will Discuss
Labor Problems

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty,
professor of economics, will ad-
dress the ﬁrst meeting of this
season ’s series of SFA Student-
Faculty Forums in 8 Cathedral
today. At the forum, scheduled
for 12:45 o’clock, Dr. Daugherty
will speak on “Current Labor
Problems.”

The speaker, recognized as a na-
tional authority on labor relations
and problems, will give an analysis
of the recent trends in labor leg-
islation, discuss the plans and pol-
icies of the major labor leaders,
and point out what he believes
will be the future for all of the
working classes after the troubled

conditions of the day have been
cleared away.

Dr. Daugherty is the ﬁrst of
prominent faculty members to ad-
dress the forum this _year. The
plan of the committee in charge,
headed by Milton G. Lehman, Jr.,
C39, is to present these men regu-
larly, speaking either on subjects
on which they are eminently
qualiﬁed or on topics of interest
in present affairs. Meetings will
be held every other Friday in the
same room at the same time.

STUDENTS MEET FACULTY

“However, the forum will fulﬁll
another purpose besides that of
keeping the student [1 abreast of
contemporary ‘affairs "and ques-
tions,” commented Lehman. “In
a University such as this, it is
rather difficult for the student
and professor to get to know one
another through smaller classes
and personal talks. We hope by
these meetings, to achieve a more

personal contact between the
two.”
The Student-Faculty Forum

represents one of the more recent
programs of SFA. Near the end
of the 1936-37 school year, two
test meetings were held at which
Dr. Samuel Williams, professor of
biology, and Dr. William T. Root,
clean of the Graduate School,
spoke. Present plans call for the
forums to be presented during the
whole of this year.

Members of the comittee in-
clude Lehman; William Murray,
C39; Richard Cooper, C38; Lea
Goldstein, C39: Regina Shipman,
C39; Eleanor Haught,C39; and J.
Howard Dice, librarian.

I-F Train
Will Travel

To Durham

Plans for the Inter-fraternity
train to the Duke football game
are nearly completed, according to
Robert Hill, BA38, Phi Gamma
Delta, chairman of the project.

The train will consist of at least
twoycoaches and a baggage car to
be used for recreation. Accord-
ing to present plans the train is to
leave Pittsburgh late Thursday
night, November 25, and arrive in
Washington, D. C., Friday morn-
ing.

After a stop of about three
hours, the train will proceed to
Raleigh, N. C., arriving there dur-
ing the afternoon.

Busses will be chartered to take
the passengers. from Raleigh to
the game in Durham Saturday aft-
ernoon. The return trip will be
made through Washington; pas-
sengers will arrive in Pittsburgh
Sunday night or Monday morning.

The-trip will cost about $20, in-
cluding admission to the game.
Tickets will be sold only to mem-
bers and pledges of the fraterni-
ties. One member in each house
is assisting Hill with the sale of
tickets and reservations. ’

The Awakening . . .

N his Chicago speech the other day, Presi-

dent Roosevelt sounded the call for renewed
activity in the interest of the problem of world
peace. _

For the nations, the United States foremost
among them, who have sat and watched the
swing of international affairs during the past
few years, who have discovered the rising tide
of international anarchy and the series of “un-
declared” wai-s-for these, the ina,]oi'ity of na-
tions, the speech should mark the beginning of

a new epoch that will take a positive interest.

in the preservation of culture and civilization
vs-hose twain stars are now being eclipsed.

'l7‘hat the l’:csident’s address is not merely
ii!'iOllil'i‘ nlczmstic profundity of wishful think-
iiig tint has inarked the United States’ policy
in the past scvei'al decades, is shown by the ‘ac-
tion of the State Department which has sup-
ported the League of Nations Assembly in
‘branding Japan guilty of violating her treaties.

This action may be a preamble to the carry-
ing out of Presid‘ent Roosevelt ’s sta-tement:

“The Vpeace-loving nations must make a
‘concerted effort in opposition to those vio-
lations of treaties and those ignorings of hu-
mane instincts which today are creating » a.
state of -international anarchy and instabil-
ity -from which -there is no escape through
isolation or neutrality.”

Further evidence that the government is
now williiig to cooperate with other nations is
also culled from -the speech:

“When an "epidemic of physical disease
starts to spread, the community approves
and joins in a. quarantine. of the patients in
order to protect the health of the community
against the spread of the disease.” ’

Ninety per ‘cent of th‘-e'w‘o.rld’s "peoples, to

use the chief ‘executives ﬁgures, want peace.-

‘Oo-‘ricerted action by this group should be more
than adequate ‘to realign the anarchic ten per

cent in the ‘into-re'st of “the welfare and secur-
ity of every nation” which “today is being-

“threatened.” _ -

America may still consider herself ‘self-suf-
ficient, but as the president says, isolation is
no solution. \Vhen warfare and aggression is
foisted upon any nation by another, the whole
world suffers.

It is not a. question of going to war or
another “war to ‘end wars” or one to “make
the world safe for democracy.” It is merely
a. just burden that the United States, as an
international citizen, must take upon‘ herself
along with other nations to preserve interna-
tional government and the world’s culture.

Melody To The Band...

ANOTHER one of those things that receive

too little commendation and not nearly‘
enough recognition around here, a friend told
us the other day, is the Pitt Bond.

VVe agreed with our friend.

‘While most of us take the band for granted

Eninirsiasm-. ’is wonderful -thingi‘ It lightens
dull hours. It keeps life worth living. But enthu-

We of the University found that outlast Sunday
when a group of—-shall we say misguided enthusi-

asts?—undertook to decorate -the Mellon Institute.
It has been rumored, of course, that their high spir-
its came -partly from bottles, but such maliciousness
has no place in this column.
V ‘The kindl-ier word “fun-loving” might apply to
"them, or perhaps we could classify them psycho-
logically as victims of an “infantile psychosis.”
Whatever the terminology, the event ’stands——
and will stand until money, emory paper and sand-
blasting can take away the last black trace.

So one thousand dollars, ‘a lot of time, and a lot
of energy go into the erasure of something that
never should have happened. A law instructor
wakes up with a black mark on his record that
nothing can erase. And four other young men can
boast the slightly empty distinction of being
morons.

What did they get out of this? Well, 3. little bit
of Iexcitement—which is supposed to keep one
young—a lot ’-of publicity, and the eternal hate of
anyone who likes to see a. beautiful building.

I think it was not necessary for them to hunt
excitement to keep them young. Their youth
has been fairly well established. The publicity
could hardly have been counted on the positive
side; and no one wants to think he is hated by
a large number of people.

What could have made them do it, then? You
guess. But I’ll bet that you’ll be able to under-
stand after the football game this Saturday. Maybe
it’s a natural reaction after such a game to let
loose, and let consequences go hang. I wouldn’t
know. And I’m in favor of victory parades and
anything else that is good clean fun.

In the meantime, if our little playmates from
New York get tired of NYU, we have a. nice place
out here in Pittsburgh that might interest them.
We call it Mayview.

In these times it pays to be serious. It is pleas-
ant to know that university students have at least»
become ‘cognizant of the fact that al-l is not college
life that snuggles deeply into -a »sta‘g’s hip pocket,"

without them.

-a ‘stag who wears loud clothes and rides ‘i":n‘p’ai'»n'ted.
mod-el T’s. Students now realize that all that is
merely a part of a rather smelly past. The .pres-

ent is serious; might we add that the "present is too I

serious. -

“Students of the University of Pittsburgh don’t 

laugh. ‘erioug .” This statement was made by one

of the wiser members of the f—aculty.- It was the _

opinion of this professor that the students of this
school are
men. - . . . . _

He failed to state Just what the bogey-men
‘personiﬁed, but we have a faint idea. that he was
referring to last summer’s peace ra_lly~,= -the -late
lamented S. L. I. D., and certain of the Forum
groups.

While we disagree with this wise man when
he implies that such worthy undertakings are
bogey‘-men, unworthy of serious ‘student atten-
tion, we do agree with him that too much time is
spent by the hot-headsiwho are constantly striv-
ing laboriously after an eifect—-that of convinc-
ing the world at large that they have the an-
swer to the question of the universe.

In other and plainer words, We doubt the sin-
cerity of most of the world savers and intellectual
heavy-weights who have been foisted on us since
the student attitude has changed for the better.
These hot-heads and embryo cynics remind us of
a bunch of kids armed with B-B guns hunting for
elephants.

We are failing to relax. We are taking ourselves
too seriously-our clothes, our activities, and, as
Mr. Francis Wallace would have us believe, our
football. We enter activities, not for pleasure’s
sake, but for activities’ sake. Campus politics, as
witness the last election, have developed into gen-
eral muckraking and underhand work that would
put to shame Lincoln Steffens himself.

Let's be serious by all means. World peace,
the "political situation, campus politics, and our
betters are all our problems. Let’s forget the
puerile iconoclasm for a. while and concentrate
upon things that we can laugh and talk about
without getting ‘so damned nasty. After all, the
next depression is still two years off and the
world still spins around despite The Bird.

he ‘could easily grope his way

back by the aid of the light which%

the Press is giving so that people
may ﬁnd their way.

No. The other Scripps-Howard
papers still keep tab of “It Seems
to Me.” But the Press had been
on a ‘joy ride, unsuspecting, and
suddenly realized that Broun’s in-
tentions might be dishonorable.
So she’s walking back home, on
the short road to conservatism and
safety.

Maybe Broun didnt mind. May-
be he cheerfully missed the de-
lightful chatter of mother-in—law
Parry, uncle Tin-pants Johnson
and Papa Pegler—the only man in
America who can write from all
angles at the same time because
of his sports training.

To Classify Ads

Frankly, I don’t think that
Broun’s intentions of organizing
a newspapermen’s union were
strictly dishonorable. But the
Press may be a little prudish about

energy in organizing the Ameri-
can Newspaper Guild will see only
the indomitable rebel spirit, a
basic spirit which remained con-
sistent through ten years of news-
paper columning.

Broun is gone from the Press.
The tumult and the shouting dies,
the Captains and the Kings de-
part, and left are the timid who
quiveringly turn their eyes to-
ward a “new liberalism.”

Perhaps Waltei O’Keefe and
Mrs. Parry will be remembered
when Heywood Broun is forgotten

Duke All-American 

Meet

Over Blsons

Thls Afternoon

Carl Olson’s “tak'e-a-crack-at-
track” stars will take a crack at
the Bethany Bisons from Bethany,
West Virginia, this afternoon at 4
o’clock over the Panther four-

mile cross—country course in
Schenley Park.

The meet was originally sched-
uled for Saturday morning, but
Olson and Elmer Schaake, Bethany
track mentor, put their heads to-
gether and decided that there
were mutual beneﬁts for both in
moving the event up to this after-
noon.

Olson did not spend too many
sleepless nights worrying about
the West Virginian’s appearance
against the Panthers. In past
meetings the Bisons have been big
and tough in name only, and last

year the Olsonmen trounced them
by a perfect score, 15-40.

Every runner on the Panther
varsity and junior varsity squad
will run against the Bethanyites.
Later in the season the Pitt J ayvee
team will meet the Bethany jun-
iors at Bethany. The date for the
meeting has not yet been set.

LOOKING FORWARD

The meet with the West Virgin-
ians will serve more as a test for
Olson to determine the seven men
he will take to Detroit next week
to meet the Wayne University hill,
and dalers. Although the Panth-
ers also defeated them by a per-
fect score last year, Olson is an-
ticipating more competition from
the Tartars over their own course
in Michigan than they gave the
Pitt runners over the Schenley
Park course.

There are several reasons for
Olson to worry a little over the
western outﬁt. For one thing
Coach Olson’s runners will be on

an unfamiliar course and a flat‘

one at that. The University cross
country men are used to the hilly
rugged Schenley park course,
whereas the Wayne tracksters are
trained to run over a ﬂat course.

Another thing that has Olson
worrying just a little is the inex-
perience of — his cross country
squad, but he is not worryi_ng
"quite as much as he did before the
Purdue meet because of the show-
ing the team made in decisively
‘defeating the Purdue boilermakers
last Saturday. As Olson puts it,
“They lack experience, but they
‘do have ‘guts’.” _ V 1 .

Next Tuesday Olson will hold a
time trial for the ‘entire squad and
by comparing the results of this
event and the results of the Pur-
due and Bethany meetings he will
determine the six or seven boys
to make the trip to Detroit.

Pitt-Duquesne
Predictions

Gathered

Although there’s a little bit of
doubt on campus as to the out-
come of Saturday’s battle between
Pitt and Duquesne, over on the
Bluff the opinion is solidly in fav-
or of a Pitt shellacking.

Some comments from both cam-
puses seem to throw light on the
matter. So judge for yourself.

Harry Radin, M40—-“Pitt better
win. There won’t be any living
in Pittsburgh if Duquesne wins.”

J. R. Bickley, professor of mod-
ern languages——“I think Pitt will
win. This is the game they will
be the most ready for.”

Mary Junge-, C41—“I think Pitt
will win. They better or I’ll be
going without lunches next week.”

George Davies, BA39—“Pitt by
three touchdowns. Keep your eye
on Goldberg.”

T. M. Finney, ‘director of music
—-"‘I’d like to see Pitt win 40-0,
but I'll be satisﬁed with 7-’0.”» ’

Carl Cass, assistant professor of.
En’glish—"‘P’it’t by three tou¢h—_
downs, I hope." But it may. be

close. Brumbaugh is the man to;
watch. He’s a menace in any
game.”

Verne Samuels, C41—“I know
some Duquesne fellows who-are

betting on Pitt and I think they’re '

only playing safe.”

A. E. Stanila-nd‘-, assistant pro-
fessor of ma'the'matics——“There’s
no doubt about it. Pitt by three
touchdowns.”

An interesting sidelight is the
scores posted by the editor of the
Duquesne Duke and several of his
assistants. Dick Cloonan, editor:
Duke, '7-0; Frank Gill, sports edi-
tor: Duke, 14-0; and Ed Wallace,
managing editor: Duke, 21-0.

Well, there you have it. Take
a guess, toss a coin, or read the
stars. We’ll see you at the game
Saturday.

Carlson Sets
Union Hours

It’s union hours for the varsity
basketeers in their p1'actice ses-
sions that begin ‘next Monday on
the stadium ﬂoor. According to
“Boss” Carlson, the varsity will

~ practice fewer hours, fewer days,

and have to quit as the closing
whistle blows.

All of which means the boys
will have about a week’s less prac-
tice in order to get into shape be-
fore the opening of the basketball
season.

It’s all a part of the new pro-
gram of training that Dr. H. C.
Carlson, coach of the basketball
team. is putting into effect. It
will give boys plenty of rest, as
the coach feels that this is what
is needed.

Practice, which begins on Mon-
day, will last until Friday, and
then begins again on the 25th.
During the week of November 1,
several of the boys can take time
off again, because the novice
basketball teams will be playing,
and the varsity boys wil act as of-
ficials. -

79 points, and its goal line has yet
to be threatened.

MANY BACKS

The Night Riders own six triple-
threat halfbacks, Matsik, McKee-
ta, Onder, Gallagher, Cain, and
Brurnbaugh, and a powerful full-
back, Karrs, who have already
exhibited fourteen muscle-mad
legs. This Karrs person s'ettles

bruising and accurate plunges.

of

Captain Maras, Critchﬁeld,

_ Amann, Platukas, and Barto are ‘'

membersof the lineup that start-
'ed last year’s contest. Grabinski,
replacing the great Basrak at cen-

ter, and Serangelli, taking over"

He_tferle’s wing post, are the only
new -faces. Coach Smith has a
bench load of dependable second
stringers for relief duty. The
only weak spot here, is the pivot

post. Grabinski has no capable I

understudy. .
Clipper Smith’s starting lineup
will probably be Platukis and Se-
rangelli at the terminals, Captain
Maras and Critchfield at the
tackles, Amenn and Barto ‘ﬂank-
ing Grabinski at center, Zoppetti

calling the signals, Onder and Mc- '

Keeta on the saddles, and Karrs at
fullback.

SIVIITH SILENT

Coach Smith could not be
reached for a statement, as is the
custom on the eve of all important
football games, so We’ll just have
to take publicity director’s Pen-
ningtons word that “Duquesne is
ready.” I

The Panthers, this week, in con-
trast to their lackadaisical prac-
tice play prior to the Ohio Wes-
leyan and West Virginia tilts, are

hustling with a vengeance. They?

are ﬁnally showing the spark and
smoothness usually associated
with Pitt elevens.

Center Post Uncertain

Hensley and Adams have been-;
spe'n'di_n*g a good bit of the tra_in- ,
ing period-on Trainer Al‘tmar’s ta- I "
ble. If their injuries are not 's'uf-I

lﬁcienzt-ly heal'e’d= by tomorrow-, Bob
Dannies,
for the center ‘post, will start.

Chickermeo and Mic}réws'en ‘are

phoning the News editor -to ﬁnd
out who Jock is startingiat quar-
terback. That -gives you an idea on
how much a tﬁoss-up is the ﬁeld
general’s job. Raskowski is the
best bet for the other guard post.
Mat_isi and.De1ichvwill be in for
the kick-off for the third consecu-
tive week.

The wing positions will be en- '

trusted to Daddio and Souchak.g
The one and only Goldberg, of ,
course, will be stationed;—but noti
stationary—at left halfback. Steb- I
bins, as a reward for his return to I
good form will be paired off with
Biggie, at right half. The full-
back assignment is almost as:
much a guess as the quarterback’
choice. But Stapulis is in better
condition than Patrick, so he may I
begin the game.

The spots were discovered soon
after the curtain was installed last
May, but action was postponed un-

been held.

“Josiah Kirby Lilly Court” is
the new and ofﬁcial name for the

B5’ GERTRUDE LIEBLICH

The girl behind the counter in the old-fashioned general
store of 1910, which carried everything from salt‘ to yard goods,

needed only the ability to make

But should the old-fashioned Storekeeper attempt to engage '
in retailing in 1937, she would be niystiﬁed by such terms as
L

Editor’s note: This is the first
article in a series of three, analyz-
ing the work of the Bureau ‘of
Business Research.) —

“research programs,” “salescheck
training,” “logic of buying,” and
“fashion fundamentals.” For the
retail selling of 1937 has reached

quires not only general informa-
tion, but also specialized training
and ability.

In what maner shall the sales-
girl answer the customer’s query,
“How can I wash this sweater
without it shrinking?” Is it
enough for her to reply, “Just
wash in carefully,” 0* should the
salesgirl be equipped with speciﬁc
knowledge to satisfy any of the
customer’s questions?

TRAINING NEEDED

Retail selling today demands
that its representatives have train-
ing. In fact, training has become
so fundamental a qualiﬁcation that
universities and colleges, noticing
the shortage of capable leaders in
the ﬁeld of selling, have often es-
tablished retail training schools.

In 1918, the personnel problem
in Pittsburgh became extremely
acute. Seven local merchants and
educational leaders, in a co-oper-
ative effort, attempted to raise the
standard of employees in depart-
ment stores.

Retail merchants and educators
of Carnegie Institute of Technolo-
gy ventured an experiment in re-
tail training based on a ﬁve-year
period. Satisfactory results en-
couraged renewal of the ﬁnancial
support for another ﬁve-year
term. starting in 1923.

At the beginning of the second
trial term, the Research Bureau
for Retail Training was moved to
the University campus. Two years
later the Bureau was permanent-
ly endowed by the department
stores and established as a grad-
uate division of the University.

EXTENDS MEMBERSHIP
Details of the Pittsburgh project

certain department stores outside
of Pittsburgh. The program was‘
expanded to include additional re-
search on problems of member
stores.

Activities of the Bureau fall in-
to three general ﬁelds: training of
students in retailing, research on
store problems, and service to
stores. Students of the Bureau
spend time in the classroom, the
office, and the department store.
The Bureau renders service to the
member stores by means of eve-
ning classes, training manuals, and
store shopping surveys.

Research programs are carried
out by students, staff, and store
employees. The Bureau collects
and compiles the ﬁndings, inter-
prets them in the light of store
problems, and suggests a practical
plan of improved methods. For
example, last year’s study by the
Bureau concerned wrapping and
packing problems.  ,

MAKES SHOPPING SURVEYS

In addition, the Bureau super-
vises quarterly shopping surveys
of Pittsburgh stores to evaluate
the effectiveness of various selling
methods. In their training pro-
grams, the department stores util-
ize the reports on these surveys,

During the past decade, the Bu-
reau has broadened its program

sonnel training remains an im-
portant part of the schedule, but
additional topics considered are
training in operation, merchandis-
ing and research.

Courses included in the curri-
culum of the Bureau cover" such
subjects as department store op-
eration and organization, retail
advertising, color, line, and design,
retail accounting, personnel man-
agement, executive leadership,
and fashion training.

The deﬁnite need of retail mer-
chants for trained leaders has not
been satisﬁed by tb.e Research
Bureau of Retail service. The
Bureau is an accomplishment of
co-operation between the mer-
chants and educators. It is a

spread to other cities and in re-
ply to requests, the Bureau ex-
tended its membership to include

to ﬁt the changes in retailing. Per- ‘
