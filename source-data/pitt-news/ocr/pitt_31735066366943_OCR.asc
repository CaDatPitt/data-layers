MAHMOOD MAMDAMI
Oratory Prize Winner
Mahmood Mamdami, plac-
ed third in the Interstate
Oratorical Contest this past
weekend. Mamdami, a jun-
ior political science major,
delivered a speech on “The
Lonely Volunteer,” based on his
perceptions of the ideals em-
bodied in the Peace Corps.

Mamdami earlier captured ﬁrst
place in the State of Pennsyl-

vania Oratorical Contest for the 2

second consecutivegyear. He was
a member of the Activities Fee
Allocations Committee this past
year, and has served as vice-pres-

ident of the University chapter of I

the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
of the International Relations
Club, and of the William Pitt De-
bate Union. He also served as
chairmen of the Pitt Progressive
Party.

Mamdami noted that the “Peace
Corp volunteer is a new ﬁgure
on the scenes. Before I came to
the states, my image of Ameri-
cans was derived from the pop.
culture, the third grade movies,
the fantastically attired tourist,
or the wealthy businessman. He
was always someone who came
to sell us something, or to gawk
at us as curio pieces, or ‘as some
cute little people with their
quaint mannerisms. For the
American, the foreigner and cul-
ture were always a collection of
textbook oddities, a kind of
heathenism.

“_Both people are prisoners of
false images of on-e another.
America has always wanted to
make contacts with the outside.
world. But all contacts hitherto
have merely been rituals of ways
of getting around a personal in-
volvement. People lived together,
and yet never understood one
another.

-“Some years ago, a new ﬁgure
came on the scene. He brought
along with him a new kind of
involvement, an involvement that
shattered stereotypes on both
sides. He came there not to sub-
ject people to a precise rule, nei-
ther to look at them as potential
markets. His was an attempt to
meet people on their own
grounds, to meet them on human
terms, on a basis of understand-
ing, taking their needs as human
needs and demonstrating a gen-
uine desire to help fulﬁll them.
In the process, the volunteer
broke his own stereotype, carried
a new image back with him, and

will carry it for the rest of his

life.”

Health Service Director
nows of No Campus Cases

By VICKIE EPSTEIN
(See Editorial Page 4.)

Dean of Men Herbert McGibbeny stated that “it would
be naive to say there isn’t any usage of LSD (lysergic acid
diethylamide) on campus but to say there is may prove
wrong.” To his knowledge no one is using LSD but “I’m sure
no one is going to tell me if there is.”

“I know nothing about usage of LSD. I don’t know of
anyone who is using it,” said Dr. Douglass Thompson, direc-

ter of the Student Health Service when questioned.

The widespread use of LSD and marijuana on college campuses
and in city ghettos is being investigated by state and federal legis-
latures. The state is conducting investigation of collegiate usage and
Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Democrat from New York, is chairman
of the Subcommittee on Executive Reorganization of the Senate Com-
mittee on Government Operations, which will hold hearings May
17-18 to identify both the dangers and legitimate research use of LSD.

When questioned Director of Men’s Housing Arthur Underwood
and Assistant Director David Ginevan said they knew of no cases of
LSD usage in the dormitories or on campus.

Dean McGibbeny suggested that
since this is an urban University
there are probably many drug
sources within the city. He call-
ed attention to the state legisla-
ture’s investigation of marijuana
and drugs on Pennsylvania cam-
puses. During this study hooded
youth have volunteered ‘to tell
why, how and where they_ re-
ceived the drugs.

According to State Senator Ben-
jamin R. Donolow, Democrat from
Philadelphia and chairman of the
joint legislature committee - con-
ducting the public hearing, some
of the witnesses are now serving
jail terms. Other witnesses in- ’
clude public officials and narcot-*
ics experts. .

Report Claims Scranton

Candidate for Chancellor

The name “Scranton” invari-
ably appears whenever questions
concerning a possible University-
chancellor arise. Yet, the actual
status of Governor William Scran-
ton in~the search for a person to
ﬁll the University’s highest post
remains clouded by contradictory
reports and rumors.

A report in a syndicated col-
umn in the Indiana Star news-
paper stated that Scranton has
no interest in seeking the Repub-
lican presidential nomination in
1968 and that he is “seriously
considering a university presi-

candidate for the chancellor of
the University.

The late Acting Chancellor Stan-
ton Crawford and Acting Chan-
cellor Dr. David Kurtzrnan have
both expressed doubts as to
Scranton’s position as a candi-
date. Shortly before his death,
Crawford explained that all the
stories in the newspapers about
the consideration of the governor
for the chancellor's post were
based on rumor.

Perhaps the. only real answer
to this cloud of contradictory
statements can‘ be provided by’
the Chancellor Search Commit-
tee. This committee has been sift-
ing through a list of approxi-
mately 100 men under considera-
ation for the position that has
been vacant for ten months.

The student body of University
of California, Berkeley, recently
voted down a referendum held
to replace the present student or-
ganization, the Associated Stu-
dents of the University of Caili-
fornia (ASUC). The referendum
suggested an “autonomus” stu-
dent government under a new
constitution.

The new constitution, which

had been framed by left-wing

campus groups, was overwhelm-
ingly defeated. It received 3,529
yes .votes against 5,053 no’s. A
two-thirds majority was required
for adoption.

Last December a constitutional
convention was called. The con-
vention was an outgrowth of a
Free Speech movement agitation
last ‘year when many students
and a large number of faculty
joined the left wing campus
groups in protest to University
policies.

The constitutional convention
was dominated by radical left
wing undergraduate and grad-

uate spokesmen, because other —

campus groups were divided on
‘issues while the radical voted as
a block. '

The block worked for an “au-

tonomous” student government
which unlike the ASUC would
not be associated with the admin-
istration and the academic senate.

Last week the radical groups
withdrew from the ASUC in or-
der~to give “legitimacy” to the
present structure of the univer-
sity, thus exposing their view of
campus democracy.

Jerry Goldstein, president of
ASUC, and and Vice-Chancellor
John Searle (both leaders in the
Free Speech Movement) were
asked by New York Times report-
er E.’ W. Kenworthy why the
constitution failed.

They felt students realized that
the new constitution would have
forced a radical minority govern-
ment dominated by radical groups
on the majority of students and
allowed that minority to issue
statements in the name of the
entire campus.

Goldstein and Searle also sug-

gested that students rejected the
idea that student government was
not an organic part of the univer-
sity structure.

Goldstein said the majority of
students recognized that the Uni-
versity community could not be a
political . community in" which
“confrontation between interest
groups is the normal way of life."
Goldstein added that an academic
community is necessarily a coop-
erative enterprise in learning.

‘ Believe It Will Work

Quo Vadis Visitors Tour UN

By BERNI McLEOD
“People are skeptical about the
UN, we all get discouraged, but
I believe the UN will work,” said
Mrs. Martha Anderson, Quo Vadis
advisor, after returning from New
York last. week.
As guests of an anonymous
“- donor, Mrs. Anderson, and na-
tionality room hostesses, Berna-
dette Onda, an engineering major,

and Nancy Knoll, a junior in pre-
med, left Pittsburgh April 25 for
a three-day tour of the United
Nations. They were the second
Quo Vadis group to make the
trip, courtesy of a UN supporter
who gave the funds in honor of
Miss Mabel Gillespie.

At the UN, the visitors were
conducted on a special tour with
the help of the Visitor Service.

Renaissance Influence 6

Shown in Polishroom

_ The 16th century was selected
‘I for the Polish Classroom because
it was considered the Golden
Age in Polish history, a period
when the inﬂuence of the art of
the Italian Renaissance reached
Poland. The plain parchment-col-
ored plaster walls of the Polish
Classrooms are ornamented with
a formal garland frieze, which is
purely Renaissance in spirit. The
18-foot ceiling beams, which are
Gothic in form, have been paint-
/ ed with bright, bold tempera dec-
orations showing Polish interpre-
tations of Renaissance design.
These decorations were inspired
by a ceiling in Wawel, the for-
tress castle overlooking Cracow
and the home of Polish kings
from ancient times.

The walnut seminar table and
chairs are copies of massive 15th
century pieces that stood in the
state dining room at Wawel. A
bronze chandelier surmounted by
a stylized Polish eagle hangs
above the table.

The windows in the bay have
handmade six-sided roundels and
the stained glass coats-of-arms of

5/

Polish institutions of higher edu-
cation. On the ﬂoor in the center
of the bay stands an enlarge-
ment of the J agiellonian globe,
said to be the ﬁrst globe on
which America appeared as a

separate continent. The original
globe belongs to the collection of
astronomical instruments at the
Jagiellonian Library at Cracow
and dates back to 1510. The cor-
nerstone presented by the faculty
of the University of Cracow is an
authentic fragment of a column
in the courtyard of the Jagiel-
lonian Library. On the wall op-
posite the blackboard hangs a
copy of the famous 19th century
oil painting of Copernicus by Jan
Matejko.

They had’ a luncheon in the vis-
itor’s lounge, visited the.Genera1
Assembly, the Security Council,
Economic and Social Council and
Trusteeship Council.

The nationality room hostesses
were impressed by the appear-
ance and presentations of the UN
guides. They met the 66 girls
and noted such techniques as a.
monitoring system, used to im-
prove the tours. Two times yearly»
senior guides attend another
girl’s tour.

“Nancy, Bernadette and I
thought this was an excellent
idea,” said Mrs. Anderson. “New
Quo Vadis Hostesses might bene-
ﬁt from such periodic checks.

“When I look back at the UN,”
said Mrs. Anderson, “I am not
discouraged by any reminders of
its failures. When you see all the
delegates working together, all
the gifts that countries have do-
nated, it appears that people care.
If nations will join together, the
UN will work.

Post - Gazette Favors
Pitt Stand on Apotheker

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has given the University Commun-
ity a pat on the back for its handling of Dr. Herbert Aptheker’s
speech. In an editorial, titled “Good Sense at Pitt,” in Monday’s edi-
tion, The Post-Gazette praised “a sensible attitude in their routine
treatment of the appearance here of Dr. Herbert Aptheker.”

" It continued, “Instead of noisily arguing over the question of
whether a Communist speaker should be allowed on the campus (as
happened recently at the University of North Carolina) Pitt’s faculty
and students listened to Aptheker, disputed those statements they
found questionable and engaged in minor heckling.”

It concluded by lauding the
University reception as being
“more in keeping with the tradi-
tions of educational inquiry and
free speech than the frequently
exhibited hysterical fear that stu-
dents have no effective intellec-
tual defense against Communist
views.”

But most important the University must decide on a policy toward
student addicts. The student body should be given a chance to state what

they feel the responsibility of their University is to them. ~

Once the problem is openly discussed the administration should state
what type of protection they would give to a discovered addict. If he
would be turned over to authorities, then-this should be made known.

The University administration needs to set up definite guidelines for

H Intellect Responds

To Anti-Intellectual

As a former Pitt student and
graduate and also the co-chair-
man of the Pittsburgh Commit-
tee to End the War in Vietnam,
I feel I must respond to the let
ter sent to The Pitt News (May
2, 1966) by Bruce Milo, an assis-
tant instructor of Slavic Lan-
guages at the University.

My ﬁrst reac-tion to the letter
was that this was just another
crackpot letter sent by an over
zealous student at the University.
With the escalation of the war

-and the -tempers of the people
voicing opinions on either side
«of the war issue, a letter such as
this one is certainly not an odd-
ity. But, after seeing who wrote
the letter, my initial response of
just passing over the letter was
turned to a response of dismay.
It is very hard to respond to an

anti—intellectua1 letter in an in- V

tellectual manner. His descrip-
tion of the people whowniakeup
the “Movement for Peace” and
“Committee to End the War" in
Vietnam,” is certainly ;a"sad coni-
mentary of intellectual capacity
of one instructor at the Univer-
sity. If he would analyze the "peo-
ple who make up the peace move-
ment in the United States ._he
would ﬁnd such mis-ﬁts as Wayne
Morse," Senator from Oregon, Er
nest Gruening, Senator from Alas-
ka; Father Charles Owen Rice,
Holy Rosary Church in Pitts-
burgh; and many other “respect-
ables”——maybe. some people in
his own department of ' study. [I
eagerly join such mis-ﬁts devoted
to peace. ,_ « ‘

If he looks againa little closer
at the people protesting this in-_

humane war, he would see that I

“Cities Are Vital )

By Berni McLeod

To the city dweller of the Middle Ages, urban life might
not have seemed such a good idea. In exchange for security,
opportunity and neighbors, he had to cope with fires,
crowds, dirty, sunless streets and all that Bubonic Plague.

Fortunately for us, cities have improved in terms of
national importance, size, and living-working conditions. In
twentieth century America, however, cities still lag behind
contemporary standards for good urban conditions. Crowd-

- ing, uncleanliness, and unsightly areas are ever present.

The nation can no longer ignore urban problems. In the
1900’s cities were considered secondary in importance to
farm country. Today, with three-quarters of the American
population living in metropolitan centers, American lives are
influenced by city conditions. ,

IN PAST YEARS when city workers were dissatisfied
with in-town living, they fled to suburbia. From Washing-
ton, D.C. to Maine suburbia has now grown into‘ a huge
megapolous, including ten percentof America’s population.

Now urban areas are here to stay. Realizing that ur-
ban welfare affects national welfare,'President Johnson re-
cently appointed Robert Weaver secretary of the newly
created Department of Urban Development. Realizing that
'a city should offer the best possible conditions for com-
merce, industry and living, urban redevelopers are seeking
change. They are trying to make a city worth coming back

to, worth spending leisure time in and worth starting or _

expanding a business in.

The disturbing knowledge that Washington, D.C. in-

fluentials and workers left town once the work day was
through, set D.'C». planners on a revelopment program. They
tried to make the city more appealing in off-work hours.
. As a night spot New York never had such problems.
Like Washington, however, its problems also lay with slums
and over-crowding. New York’s answer._to slums are low-
rent, x-shaped apartment buildings.

Younger Voters Wanted

Associated Collegiate Press

Thanks to Rep. Charles Weltner of Georgia, an old issue is gain-
ing new life. Weltner has introduced in the House a bill to stan-
dardize the minimum voting age in national elections at 18.
Commenting on the proposal, the State Press,_ Arizona State University,

continued:

, In addition to the argument that men old enough to serve in the

TO COPE WITH COMMERCIAL CROWDING, New

.:'..."Yorl<’ has concentrated on building higher and higher, reach-

ing a new high with the upcoming New York Trade Center
on Manhattan’s Lower West Side. Unfortunately, accord-
ing to Wolf Von Eckart, Architectural Critic for The
Washington Post, the massive building, is a “fearful instru-
ment of urbicide, one of the ugliest buildings in the world.”

Twenty years ago urban redevelopers in Pittsburgh,
realized that this smoky city was in need of planned recon-
struction. As a result, of their efforts, Pittsburgh now

boasts a drastic reduction in air pollution, and a Gateway.

Center, the new complex of parks and officebuildings.
:«'g~_,« Last week, the Pennsylvania Railroad disclosed.plans
0 for Penn Center. When completed, a run-down section of
- the city will be converted into forty blocks of boulevards,
reflecting pools, contour terraces, a great mall, office build-
ings, and apartment houses, built as the need arises.

SUCH A PLAN not only beautifies the city, but, as
noted by an editorial in Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press, office
and living space required by the city in upcoming years.
Pittsburgh is an important industrial and commercial cen-
ter. Its growth, however, depends on facilities to encourage

‘E and accommodate expansion. _ _

 Cities are a vital part of America, touching the lives of
millions of Americans, and influencing the well-being of the
nation. It’s about time they received the attention they need

cogent points. Oneis the increasing youthfulness of the U.S. popula-
tion. He notes that within a short time, more than half of the popu-
lation will be under 25 years of ages. Four states already have mini-
mum voting ages of less than 21: Weltner’s home state of Georgia
(l8)( Alaska (19), Hawaii (20), and Kentucky (18).

Considering the youthfulness of collegians, this issue should ‘be.

national events than their elders.
Lowering the minimum voting

electoral system; in fact, it could
help it by injecting a good deal
of energy and enthusiasm into
national campaigns. - _.

Congressman Weltner enumer-
ates a list of activities in which_
18-year-olds may participate, in-
cluding the Peace Corps, the
Olympics, the ministry, and the
armed forces. He then asks why
these activities should be open to
persons who are not allowed the
basic rights of citizenship. Log-
ically, the question is impossible
to answer.

To effect a chance such as Welt-
ner contemplates, a constitutional
amendment would be necessary.
This means a gigantic job of ca-
joling, persuading and ‘campaign-
ing. Numerous complications are
involved.

Fine Arts Study Grant

The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust awarded
the University a grant for $84,000, according to Dr. Frank W. Wads-
worth, dean of the school of humanities-

The program, which enables graduate students in the Department
of Fine Arts to travel in Europe and America to study outstanding
art collections, consists of two parts. ,

The first part includes two week research seminars at major
collections in the United States. Held during the fall and winter tri-
mesters, the seminars will be extensions of graduate seminars and
will enable graduate students to see in the original the works studied

ROTC
Awards

Commissions

The ROTC department has an-
nounced the awarding of commis-
sions as U. S. Army Second Lieu-
tenants to ten University grad-
uates. Two ROTC scholarships
have also been presented by the
Army to juniors Robert J. Kos-
telnik and Dewayne A. Spires.

The new officers received their
commissions from Lt. Col. Ben-
jamin Hollis, professor of mili-
tary science at the University.
Four of these officers were named
Distinguished Military Graduates
which makes them eligible for
commissions in the Regular
Army. The other graduates will
serve in the Army Reserve.

William M. Cameron, George
J. Dvorznak, Edward S. Miller,
_and Ernest M. Myers were those
honored as Distinguished Mili-
tary Graduates.

The other awardees included
Michael A. Glatt, Charles R.

_ Lloyd, Kieve Pearlman, Michael
E. Perry, Albert E. Petras, and- '

Thomas I. Symons.

The scholarships presented to
Kostelnik and Spires will cover
tuition, fees, and books and will

grant them $50 per month during

their junior and senior years.
The Army has awarded 251 of
these scholarships to students of
39 Colleges and universities in the
15-state northeastern area of the
U.S.

earlier.

The second part consists of ten-
week research seminars to be
held abroad during the spring
and summer trimesters. On a ro-
tating basis, one member of the
departmental faculty will take
six to ten graduate students to
major collections abroad for study
and research.

Collections to be studied are
the New York Metropolitan Mu-
seum, the Philadelphia Museum,
the Walters Gallery in Baltimore,
the National Gallery in Washing-
ton, D. C., the Art Institute of
Chicago, and major collections in
Amsterdam, London, Paris, Mu-
nich, Milan, Venice, Rome, and
Athens.

Dr. William C. Loerke, profes-
sor and chairman of the Fine
Arts Department, said, “This pro-
gram will make certain that both
graduate students and faculty
maintain a steady, professional
contact with works of art in the
original.

 

Deve1opingNation’sOfficials
Attend GSPIA Program

Twenty-seven officials from developing countries are attending
the third annual Institute on Management of Development Projects, at
the University’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA), from May 1 through July 24. The Institute is sponsored
through the Agency for International Development (AID).

The program, under the supervision of Dr. A. Gaylord Obern,
GSPIA director of special training, is designed to help train partici-
pants in planning, evaluating and implementing development proj-
ects. Conducted on a seminar workshop basis, the Institute will stress
the participant’s capacity to decide what projects have the most prom-

ise for effective execution and
will further the country’s devel-
opment by attracting external as-
sistance and investment.

A ﬁve-day ﬁeld trip to Puerto
Rico to observe project develop-
ment and operations in public
works, industry and agriculture
will be included in the program.

At Leech Farm ) Field

games.

(By GEORGE LIES

Rained out of its home opener Monday, the baseball
team goes against West Virginia today at Leech Farm Road
at 3:30 p.m. Coach Bobby Lewis’ mitters will ‘be trying to
avenge last week’s 1-0 loss at Morgantown.

On the mound for Lewis will be lefthander Dave Welty (2-1)
who lost last week's game despite striking out eight batters and al-
lowing only four hits.

Pitching for WVU coach Steve -Harrick will be. either Vaughn Ko-
vach (7-2) or Jerry Meadows (7-2). In a doubleh-eader win against
Davidson last Saturday, Kovach, with an earned run average of 0.44,
gave up only two hits, while teammate Meadows (1.98 ERA) " allowed

The rainout of the Parsons College game was the fourth of the
year for the mitters. They own a 5-4 record while WVU, playing in
28 games, has recorded 21 wins and one tie.

. Two players, whose last names are familar to boxing fans, lead
the Mountaineer offense. Second baseman Walt Listuon is batting at
a .361 pace and ﬁrst baseman Jim Clay is hitting .306. Catcher Chuck
Boggs, hitting .351, and centerﬁelder Don Hetzel, with 13 runs batted
in, ‘supply added strength behind a solid mound corp.

After facing the Mountaineers at home, the. mitters go
road (again). They play three games in two days, meeting Colgate
Friday and Syracuse in a doubleheader. Saturday. ‘

, “We go against four rough baseball schools this week,” Lewis
said. _“West Virginia has a good pitching staff; Syracuse’s strength
lies in their hitting, while Colgate ﬁelds a .500 team.” >

‘Last year in a doubleheader win against the Orangemen, Lewis
used his top pitchers Lee Bruekel (6-2) and Dave Blyshak (5-2). This
season, however, Lewis ﬁnds. himself short-handed. Don Stock is to .
pitch Friday and Welty again in one game Saturday but after that
Lewis must do a little maneuvering.

' “Pau1 Helsel (who tore a rib muscle earlier) started warming up
last ‘Saturday and I might have to use him in the second game,” Lewis
said. As a spot pitcher last season, Helsel was undefeated in three

“When the NCAA committee picks teams for the district playoffs,”
said Lewis who is on the District Two (Pa.-N.Y.-Del.-N.J.) Committee,
“they look at a team’s overall record and who they have played, but
they also check a team’s pitching staff. To them, a team needs two

or three good starters.”

SPARKPLUG of the Panther baseball team, third
baseman Tom Beckett is the key to coach Bobby
Lewis’ inﬁeld. He bats‘ third in the lineup.

“We have a good ball club,’3_;.;.-—Lewis continued. “We weren’t hit-
ting-as weiies last yearland '.x5\”re—_"§-l_.,o‘stvs'<')'rneione-run games. But after
those ﬁrst few games, I got a .chance to see who was best. Now I am
using the best ‘hitting’ lineup I can put in there.”

Oregon Speeds Up Damien Koch;

_ ‘ A longdistance phone call
the other day to the Univer-
sity of Oregon revealed some
interesting footnotes to the
Damien Koch-— story. Koch,
a promising long distance
runner, transferred from
Pitt last year, blasting his
coach, Carl Rees, and the
track program as he left.

Part of his departing words
were, “I’ve seen too many
good runners come here as
enthused freshmen only to
end up’ as apathetic runners
under Rees’ coaching.. , .

In reply, Rees called the
attack, “Slanderous, unethic-
al, and embarrassing.”

As’ a transfer, Koch has
been sitting out a year from
NCAA competition. But ac-
cording to Oregon’s publicity

 f director, Koch has been per-
f. ‘forming in come-on meets.
 His times for the mile have
1 been-around 4 :12 and for the
two mile, 9:16. =
In last'Satu'rday’s ‘.‘Big 4”
meet here, the winning times
for the mile and two mile
were 4212.8 and 9:21, re-
spectivkely.

Carlen and Hart, both new

also has a lot more talent to

to have. If Pitt doesn’t beat
the Mountaineers by 20
points next year, James

Most of Hart’s assistant
coaches have recently return-

football technology. Jim Roy-

Hitting Spree Surprises
Shortstop Steve Kienzl”

Unlike shortstops on major league teams, Steve 
does not lay claim to being the glamor boy of the Panthe

baseball team.

He knows he is not a power hitter, yet he has hit th V. ‘
home runs in nine games this season. He does not come up
with the clutch hit when men are on base, although he say 

he has had many chances. On the
ﬁeld, he makes a few errors, but
he has played regularly at the
shortstop position since the ﬁrst
day he wore a Panther uniform.

“Traveling is a real inconveni-
ence,” Kienzl said. “There are
times on the road when we get
maybe ﬁve hours sleep -and then
have to play a game the same
day. Everyone treats us good, but
all the away trips detract‘ from
study time. Besidesiyou feel more
relaxed at home; you play better
ba-ll.”

During the mitters’ opening sea-
son road trip through the South,
Kienzl may have decided against
playing at home. In the ﬁrst
three games, he collected ﬁve hits
in nine at bats.

‘-‘Surprised? Boy was I when I
.started hitting like that,” Kienzl
said. ‘Kienzl’s hitting spree ac-
tually began last year, thanks ‘to
coach Bobby‘ Lewis. It was just
after Kienzl went 0-16 at the
plate. A

“He changed my style from a_. A

deep crouch where I hit from a
closed stance.” continued Kienzl.
“He opened my legs up, and I

 team.
" Lieberman, who was the num-
V ber three singles player at Shady-
"side Academy three years ago
» now holds the same position here,
lthough this is only his ﬁrst year
i on the team. He and Marty'Lie-
. -bowitz are the only juniors on the
height man team. All the other
players are sophomores.
Liberman ranks this inexperi-
ence under match conditions as
' the team’s top problem. “Some of
the boys play a lot better in prac-
I tice than they do in matches. But
‘once they get a couple of vic-
tories under their belts we’ll be
~ all right. We’re very enthusiastic
;; ‘and try very hard.”
One of the things which hind-
us the growth of the team is the
. lack of scholarships. “If they
would start giving scholarships
the caliber of the team would be
bound to go up. If a boy was real
.,good, say number one in the area,
_ and he had a scholarship offer
. from an Ivy League school he
would be crazy to pay to come
here when he could go there for
free. Without scholarships the
team can never hope to compete
with Ivy League schools.”

Scholarship Also at Fault
Lieberman Sees
Dampened by Poor Facilities

, MIKE BROURMAN

, According to tennis player Erik Lieberman it will take
a lot more than enthusiasm and effort to build up the tennis

I program at Pitt. The team is hampered not only by the fact

that the University does not givetennis scholarships, but

also by the lack of facilities necessary to build up a strong

Another impediment is the lack
of practice facilities. “Part of the
team practices at Kennard and
part practices at Arsenal,”A Erik
said. “This makes it hard to mold

"a really cohesive group. It cuts

down on the practice time itself,
and besides that, you don’t see
some of the players for two or
three days.” '

The new courts that the Uni-
versity expects to have ready
this fall would relieve this situa-
tion, but until then the team will
go on practicing at two different
courts and playing their home
matches at a third court.

Enthusiasm

This week the tennis team is on
the road for two matches. They
meet Cornell this Thursday, and
then meet Syracuse on Saturday.
Lieberman will take a three and
two singles record, and, teaming
with Bill Nichols, a four and one
doubles record into the two
matches. .

Erik has high hopes for the
rest of the season. “Tennis is
mentally very fatiguing but the
team works real hard. We don’t
take this as a joke, even if every-
body else does.”
