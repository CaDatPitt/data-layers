Staff Report

As it has been for the past 70
years, Pittsburgh will remain
in the hands of the Democratic
Party. Last night, incumbent
Luke Ravenstahl won the may-
oral election 42,19O votes to
Republican Mark DeSantis’
23,173.

Libertarian candidate and
Pitt student Tony Oliva re-
ceived 497 votes, and Socialist

candidate Ryan Scott received
530.

At Ravenstahl’s election
night headquarters at the Wes-
tin Hotel Downtown, support-
ers chanted, “I like Luke” and
the mayor jogged onto the stage
to the tune of “Beautiful Day”
by U2.

“Thank you, Pittsburghli’ he
yelled. , O

“Thank youfor blessing me
with the honor to continue to
serve as your mayor.”

Two women seated at the

Isaacs had campaigned with
Ravenstahl all day while Sayers
remained in the campaign of-
ﬁce. Sayers said thattthe ofﬁce
had been heavy with tension
and anticipation all day.

“But obviously he hopes he’s
going to win and I hope he will.
I’ve gone door to door with

Transit plan would bring light rail system to Oakland

by Ryan Burger
Staff Writer

If all goes according to
plan, Pittsburgh and Oakland
could be in for major changes
in mass transit, including noth-
ing less than a light rail system
connecting Oakland to Down-
town.

The plan, unveiled last week
by Allegheny County chief ex-
ecutive Dan Onorato, is based
on the recommendations of
the county’s Transportation
Action Team and includes the

construction of two new light
rails.

“Our goal is linking our re-
gion’s three economic centers
— Downtown, Oakland and

the airport,” Onorato said in a

press release..

The proposal includes the
construction of two new rapid
transit light rail systems to con-
nect Oakland with other parts
of the city.

Oakland and Downtown
would be connected by one of
the light rails, while the sec-

ond light A rail would connect '
Pitt’s campus to Carnegie Mel-
lon, UPMC Shadyside and the

-Pittsburgh Technology Center

on Second Avenue.

This Oakland circulator
would alleviate trafﬁc conges-
tion in Oakland, in addition to
providing greater mobility for
students who live on campus.

According to Kevin Evanto,
spokesman for Onorato, the
proposed rapid transit is basi-
cally an extension of the T.

The rapid transit system

would be similar to the Port
Authority’s T light rail that al-
ready connects the suburbs of
the South Hills to Downtown.‘

According to Evanto, there
are currently three proposed
routes to connect Oakland with
Downtown. ,

The ﬁrst proposed route
would run along Second Av-
enue.

A second option would fol-
low the Martin Luther King Jr.
busway, which runs through
the Strip District, Polish Hill

and Shadyside.

A third possible line would
go through the Hill District, the
most direct route from Oakland
to Downtown.

But Evanto believes that a—
route along either Second Av-
enue or the busway would be
most likely.

“The public owns the land
along the roads. It’s private
land [in the Hill District], and
we would have to purchase

T right-of—way,” he said.

Incumbent earns
64 percent of vote

Election, page I

was high with optimism and good spir-
its. Supporters chatted with smiles on
their faces, sipped wine and enjoyed a
special appearance by Johnny Angel and
the Halos, one of Ravenstahl’s favorite
groups. _

At Navarra, a restaurant just a few
blocks away, about 100 supporters were
awaiting the arrival of the challenger
DeSantis. ,

When Ravenstahl led with 64 percent

of the vote, DeSantis conceded at ap-

proximately l0 p.m.

“I want to thank everyone who
stepped in front of the touch screens and
across party lines to vote for a Repub-
lican,” DeSantis said with an earnest
smile.

The event attracted a diverse crowd
of Republicans, Democrats, student
volunteers, bloggers, former congress-
woman Melissa Hart and the president
of the Fraternal Order of Police, James
Malloy. DeSantis’ followers agreed with
his belief that Pittsburgh requires imme-
diate action to bring the city out of its
$2.4 million debt. ‘

“He had a couple of good points
about keeping people our age in the city
and to givebusinesses incentive to come
here. I liked how he said that he wanted

' to bring businesses here, not just empty
buildings to house those businesses,” -

Pitt student Lisa Patterson said.
Patterson was with two other stu-
dents from Pitt’s political communica-
tion class who were required to spend 15
hours helping ‘a candidate in a campaign
and decided to support DeSantis.
DeSantis told the crowd, “This wasn’t
about politics. This was about policies.

This was about progress. This was about '

the people and ﬁnally our promise for a
new and better Pittsburgh. We love this

A city and we are going to continue to be-

lieve in it just like we’re going to believe
in the power of taking a chance and the
real possibility of change.”

Despite his loss, DeSantis won more

votes than Republicans have in recent

elections. .

The 2005 Republican candidate Joe
Weinroth received 27.2 percent of the
votes to Bob O’Connor’s 67.1 percent.

. In 2001, Republican ‘James Carmine re-

ceived 23 percent of the vote and lost to

tis recently and wished him well and
thanked him for “a campaign that was
well run.”

Onorato made an appearance to show
his support, as did the Allegheny County
Democratic Party chair Jim Burn.

Onorato said it was “an easy race for

, him” running unopposed and receiving

nominations from both parties, adding
that it gave him more time to devote to
Ravenstahl’s campaign.

“It was an enjoyable day today,” he

said. “If [Ravenstahl] has a signiﬁcant
winptonight, which I believe he will, it
certainly gives him the authority to say
I’ve been through it, I debated the issues
and I’ve been elected on my own right.”

Onorato stressed the fact that Raven-
stahl has earned the right to be elected
for the ﬁrst time after being “thrown

_ into” the ofﬁce after former mayor Bob

O’Connor’s death.

“It’s a big difference,” he said. “Start-V
ing tonight he will be the mayor because
the people elected him mayor, not be-
cause he was president of Council.

“I think that changes his standing a
little bit in a positive way.”

Burn agreed that the numbers, Ra-
Venstahl with 63.64 percent and De-
Santis’ with 34.34 percent of the votes
at approximately 9 p.m., were “very en-
couraging.” — A

“At the end of the day, the city of
Pittsburgh seems to be satisﬁed and ex-
cited about the things that the mayor has
begun to do and the things that ‘Mayor
Ravenstahl will continue to do to pre-
serve the city,” he said. '

Burn also said that, given the amount
of campaigning and funding DeSantis
received, his 34 percent of the votes was

V ‘‘abysmal.’’ .

“It’s low for a Republican who had
a quarter of a million dollars of Repub-
lican money from across the state and
from Washington D.C.,” he said. ,

Across town, 28-year-old candidate
Oliva spent the night watching the elec-
tion returns with his staff in the South
Side. He received 497 votes.

“To be quite honest, I deﬁnitely think
I could have done better. I made some
rookie mistakes and the next time I run I
hope to do better.”

town and Oakland, they are the second
and third busiest commuter destinations
in Pennsylvania, behind only downtown
Philadelphia,” said Evanto. I

To put that in perspective, Evanto
said that the neighborhood of Oakland
alone “is busier than places like Erie,
Scranton and Harrisburg.”

“We want to give Pitt, UPMC and
Carnegie Mellon the opportunities to
expand,” said Evanto. “There’s not that
much land left in Oakland to develop,”
he said, noting that “Pitt and CMU have
had to start expanding elsewhere.”

The proposal has been welcomed by
Pitt. .

“The University is very interested
in the transit system,” said Pitt’s vice
chancellor of community relations,
Reynolds Clark. “There is a need to
move people more efﬁciently around
Oakland.” ‘

“Taking some of the automotive
pressure of Oakland obviously would
alleviate the trafﬁc problem in Oak-
land,” he said.

Reynolds also said that a direct light
rail system from Oakland to Downtown

would greatly beneﬁt the employees
and commuters who must make the dai-
ly trek into Oakland.

“Right now a lot of employees ride
the T to Downtown and then must take
buses to Oakland,” Clark said. v

“Port Authority has been expanding
and updating,” Evanto said, adding that

it’s important to “look towards the fu-‘
ture and the next stage of expansion,”-

with regard to public transportation.

He pointed to similar transit systems
in Miami, San Francisco and Vancouver
as evidence of the success of rapid tran-
sit systems.

Evanto said that the Oakland circula— ‘

tor could possibly be elevated above the
streets and sidewalks of Oakland.

“Chances are that it would be el-
evated,” he said. “Theoretically it could
be built pretty quickly” and would be
“much cheaper to build than to tunnel
underground.”

Evanto also noted thatthe road clo-

sures and delays caused by tunneling

underground would beunacceptable to
most commuters.
However, one of the biggest’ obsta-

cles to overcome is cost. While still in

Proposed light rail could be elevated

its earliest stages, such an ambitious
project would likely cost hundreds of
millions of dollars.

Onorato has proposed a “public-pri-
vate partnership” as a way to provide
funding for the project.

“With increasingly tight budgets at
the federal, state and local levels, we
are looking toward public—private part-
nerships and innovative funding ap-
proaches to make these linkages a real-
ity,” Onorato said. ,. '

While Clark believes this is “a con-
cept that needs to‘ be further investi-
gated,” both he and Evanto believe that
federal transportation money could go a
long way towards ﬁnancing the project.

Evanto realizes that “funding is the
mainlimiting factor,” while Clark sug-
gests that ofﬁcials should “wait and see
how much is left over” from federal
transportation funding before settling
on a speciﬁc plan.

But the beneﬁts to Oakland and to
Pitt students would be undeniable if the
proposal becomes a reality.

“I believe it would have a very dra-
matic and positive impact on the lives
of students,” Clark said.

won. If not me, I hoped that DeSantis
would have broken the stereotype that
this city just votes on party lines.” _
When asked what he would say to the
nearly 500 people who voted for him,
Oliva replied: “I wish_ every single one
of them could have told about 100 people
to do the same.”
Ravenstahl will serve as mayor for

‘two years, ﬁnishing out O’Connor’s

term.

“We’ve made some mistakes and
we’ve faced some serious challenges,”
he said. “But we always learn and con-
tinue to get better. ,?

"Likewise, Pittsburgh_also has faced
many challenges over the years, but to-
night is about our city coming together to

Sodexho plans to break World record for food drive

by Lauren Buches
Staff Writer‘

Pitt students and faculty can fight
the war against hunger and help Sodex-
ho earn a spot in the Guinness Book of
World Records at the same time today.

Cans Across America, a food drive
run by Sodexho, will be held from
12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m, in all Pitt din-
ing facilities.

The goal of Cans Across America is
to beat the official Guinness World Re-
cord for the most non-perishable food
donated in a 24-hour period.

The previous record of 221,028.85
pounds of food was held by the Regina
District Food Bank in Regina, the capi-
tal of Saskatchewan, Canada.

The event, organized by the nation-
al Sodexho Foundation, was started in
2006. _ 8

Last year, the nation-wide college
campus dining facility fell just short of
its goal to collect more than 221,028.85
pounds of food.

Todd Shoenberger, director of op-
erations for Sodexho Dining Services,
said that Pitt contributed $700 worth of
food to the Greater Pittsburgh Commu-
nity Food Bank last year. _

“Smaller universities try to contrib-
ute about 500 pounds of food,” Kim
Workman, the marketing director for

Sodexho’s Pitt office, said. “I set the .

goal of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds for this
year.”

During the Cans Across America
event, every dining facility on campus
will have bins available for students
and University employees and faculty
members accepting donated canned

8 ‘ goods.

The checkout registers will also
accept Dining Dollar, Panther Fund,
credit card and cash donations for peo-
ple who can’t run out to a grocery store
for food but still wish to donate, Work-
man said.

At the end of the food drive Sodexho
takes an amount of canned goods out
of. its storerooms equivalent in price to
the amount of money donated.

Sodexho will sort the canned goods ‘

that were donated throughout the day
and send the food to the Greater Pitts-

MJ Kelly Realty

burgh Community Food Bank, Work-
man said.

A The food bank then distributes the
food to 380 member agencies in 11
Western Pennsylvaniacounties, said
Iris Valanti, the Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food Bank’s public rela-
tions coordinator.

The actual weight of the food is cal-
culated into the monetary amount of
food collected.

The weight of any additional pack-
aging does not go into Sodexho’s total

    
  

amount of pounds donated, Workman
said.

Although Sodexho donates all per-
ishable food that was not purchased by
students at the end of each day to the
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food
Bank, Workman hopes that the 24-hour
food drive will urge students to donate
to those who are less fortunate.

“It’s the holiday season,” Workman
said. “You read articles on families
who don’t have enough food. If you

Priestas best choice

for SGB president

Members of The Pitt News’ edi-
torial board met Sunday with SGB
presidential candidates James Priestas
and SumterLink During the meeting,
the candidates discussed key points
of their platforms and their stances
on several pronrinent University is-
sues. The following is a summary” of
the candidates’ stances on what The
Pitt News editorial board believes to
be the most important University and
campaign issues.

Campus safety
Both Priestas and Link admitted
to problems existing in the Universi-
ty’s SafeRider shuttle service, which
students can call for a ride if they ﬁnd
themselves in an unsafe location late
at night The service, funded by the
student transportation fee and operat-
ed by the University’s transportation
committee, has experienced prob-
lerns meeting the inﬂux of requests
for rides on weekend nights. Stu-
dents also complain that the service’s
boundaries — which exclude popular
student destinations and residences
like parts of Shadyside, Squirrel Hill,
the South Side and the Waterfront —
are too restrictive.
Priestas, who called SafeRider
a “great service,” said he couldn’t:
promise to make any major changes
to the program," but pledged that as
president he would work with the
transportation committee to increase
the number of phone lines for the
service. Priestas said that improve-
ments in SafeRider could come from
a number of small changes, rather
than a comprehensive overhaul of the
existing service. He also stressed the
importance of maintaining campus
safety through a number of alterna-
tive channels, including an increase in
police patrols and security cameras.
Link, who said that the biggest
problem with the service was that op-
erators were overwhelmed with calls,
pledged that, as president, he would
work to improve the service, and also

discussed the possibility of expand-
ing university shuttle times in order to
alleviate the number of the calls into
SafeRider. In the presidential debate
held Thursday, Link also called for an
increase in blue light emergency call
boxes in South Oakland

Winner: A tie. Neither Priestas nor
Link promised any deﬁnite changes
to the SafeRider program Instead,
both candidates emphasized the im-
portance of developing alternative
rnearrsofsecurityirrordertotake
pressure oﬁ° of SafeRider. Link’s idea
for a blue light system could be Very
diﬂicult to implement because the
blue lights have to be placed on Uni-
versity property, which doesn’t ex-
tend throughout the more dangerous

parts of Oakland Priestas suggested  

an increased reliance on the Pit Po-
lice — which is great, but not enough
of a change to take dependence oif of
SafeRider and otfer students a secure
way of getting home at night

Panther statue project
Priestas and Link were asked to
expand on their part in the board’s
decision to approve the estimated
$60,000 panther-statue project, as
well as how they planned to oversee
the project if elected president
Priestas, who voted for the proj-
ect, said he believed that the panther
statues would give campus organiza-
tions an equal chance in helping to
increase Pitt pride. He emphasized
that the project was funded from roll-
over money ﬁorn last year’s student

activity fee and was not taking money .

away ﬁorn other organizations re-

, questing allocations.

While Priestas maintained his
support for the project, he admittal
that he believed the board’s decision
to approve the project over the sum-
mer was rushed. Irr terms of oversight,
Priestas suggested possible locations
for the statues throughout campus
and nixed a plan suggested by SGB

president Shady Heinen to solicit the statues
to local businesses. Throughout his discussion
of the statue project, Priestas maintained his
optimism about ﬂre project’s future, predicting
that students would become attached to — and
might even call for an increase in — the pan-
thers in the coming year.

Link, who also voted to approve the project
this summer, said that he was disappointed in
the way the project was handled. Link said that
he saw the panther statues as a way to beneﬁt
a lot of students with varying amounts of cam-
pus involvement. Link did not elaborate on his
plans for oversight of the project, but pledged
that he would refrain from ordering more stat-
ues next year unless he was convinced that it
was the wish of the student body. , A

Winner: Priestas. While both candidates voted
for the project, which we believe was approved
too quickly and without enough strident feed-
back, Priestas gave a more realistic and detailed
plan for oversight of the project for next year.
Like it or not, the panther statues are here to
stay. V A ’

Now weneed to make sure that the statues
are incorporated efﬁciently and inexpensively
into campus. The future costs, safety concerns
and locations of the panthers are all important
issues in the oversight of the panther project
this coming year, and Priestas appears to be the
most informed on the costs and feasibility of all
aspects of the project. I

Feasibility of campaign promises

Priestas’ primary campaign promise is to
regain a strident vote on the Board of Trust-
ees, which was removed in 1997. In his cam-
paign statement, Priestas said that the retum of
the student vote on the Board of Trustees will
“give the student body a legitimate presence to
voice their concerns on important issues such
as tuition and fee increases.” Priestas hasalso
focused his campaign on an issue very near and
dear to his heart: University pride and tradition,
which he hopes to errrphasize through projects
like the panther statues and the “Code Blue” T-
shirt, which he helped develop in his term on
the board last "year. Priestas also hopes to place
a revamped student events calendar on the
homepage for every University computer.

Linkhasfocusedhiscarr1paignontheim-
plementation of a fall break, which, he said he
has been working on for the past year during
his term on the board A referendtun on strident
interest in the implementation of a fall break is
currently open for vote on my.pittedu. In terms
of progress toward achieving a fall break, Link
only speciﬁed that he had met with dean of un-

dergraduate students Kathy Humphrey several
times during his term on the board.

He stressed that the University remains open
to the idea of a fall break if it believes the stu-
dents have an interest, and that if students sup-
port the idea of a fall break in the referendum,
he will oversee the project to success. Link has
also focused his platform on improving non-
alcoholic programming on campus by rrraking
the student recreation center in the Union free to
students on weekends.

He also emphasized the importance of
“communication between students, admir1is—
tration and diiferent facilities that students use
at the University” in his campaign statement.
As an example of his work toward achieving
improved communication, Link cites his prog-
ress toward getting signs in campus laundry
facilities to instruct students how to contact the
proper channel for repair. When questioned

on his speciﬁc progress toward achieving the

signs, Link remained vague, only stating that he
was working with University administrators to
develop specially rrrade signs.

Winner: Priestas. The most disappointing as-
pect of Link’s campaign promise for improved
communication is that he seems incapable of
demonstrating it himself. Rather than dealing
with bureaucratic obstacles in getting signs
posted in University residence halls, Link could
have notiﬁed students of the correct number to
call for laundry repair service as easily as hitting
the “print” button and hanging the signs him-
self. Sure, specially made signs are nice, but
a paper ﬂyer will work in the meantime. And
while the promise of a fall break is attractive,
Linkpledgedthisayearagowhenheranfor
boardanditappearsthathisonlyprogresshas
been getting the referendum on my.pitt_edu this
fall.

Priestas also promises some lofty campaign
goals, chief among them being the return of a

‘ student vote on ﬂre Board of Trustees. But his

record on the board, which includes lowering
the budget as the board’s business manager,
and fulﬁlling his projects of establishing the
“Code Blue” shirt and the republication of the
Pit Compass demonstrate his ability to follow
through on campaign promises and projects.
Priestas is the more qualiﬁed candidate for
SGB president. His record on the board dem-
onstrates his competence as a leader and com-
municator and his ability to follow through
on campaign promises. IfThe Pitt News took
nothing else away from our meeting with Pries-
tas it was this: The man loves Pitt. And we trust
him to lead our university in a positive and pro-
gressive direction in the following year. '

Letter to the
Editor

Dear Editor,

Finally, a column for urban enthusiasts to take delight in! Peter Mastracci’s col-
umn “South Side gentriﬁed” from Monday’s issue is a prime example of the current
situation and the history of one of Pittsburgh’s most popular neighborhoods. How-
ever, the column suggests that the entire South Side Flats neighborhood is turning
into an upscale, suburban mall as “yuppies” and “dinks” (Dual Income No Kids)
move into the area.

As an urban studies major who is currently interning with a non-proﬁt commu-

nity development company based-in the South Side, I feel that the columnist did not

closely examine the overall neighborhood and made a hasty generalization about
gentriﬁcation.

First, the South Side Works should not be equated with the rest of the South Side
Flats: It is new construction by a private developer with very high property values.
It is true that property values in general have been increasing in the South Side, but
there are still affordable places to live and properties to own.

Regarding the contrasts between Starbucks and the Beehive Cafe, it should be
noted that although Starbucks is a national brand, it has helped to solidify the district
as well as add curb appeal. Starbucks moved into a dilapidated and empty building
and renovated its facade to return it to the original style of the building. Even though
Starbucks may seem to be an overbearing corporation, it still takes pride in its loca-
tion and has made a commitmentto the neighborhood. «

Gentriﬁcation is not a new phenomenon: It happens in every city neighborhood

‘regardless of location. Gentriﬁcation can be a bad thing but it affects every neighbor-

hood at some point or another, and it is the responsibility of the community and city
at large to deal with it.

“Fred Claus” is this year’s ﬁrst offering in

As usual, some movies will be comfortably

“Fred Claus” falls somewhere in the middle,
addressing the Santa mytllos with a tongue—in—

spin on its lesson about family values.

You see, this year the liberal media isn’t
alone in its war on Christmas — on its side is
Santa’s own big brother Fred (Vince Vaughn).

His disdain for Christmas begins when he
and his brother Nicholas (Paul Giamatli) are

children. While Fred wants to be a good older
brother, he can never step out of Nick’s shadow,
particularly after Nick single—handed1y invents
Christmas Nat-

out of water. Vince Vaughn plays his usual fast-
talking cynic, but the witty jerk attitude becomes
tiresome quickly. Taking up the reins as head
funnyman without a costar like W111 Fenell or
Owen Wilson to even ﬂre score leaves most of
Vaughn’s witticisms hanging in the air. Vlfrth no.
one to reciprocate, some poor sap is always stuck
taking a mean—spirited verbal sucker punch.

Though he and Fred are estranged, Santa is
eager to mend their relationship. The only thing
keeping him from doing so is Fred, who’s rnis—
erable around his brother and continuously takes
greatpleasure inrrrakinghimlookandfeellike
an imbecile.

Thenarratorremindsus severaltirnesthat
this storyis aboutF1ed, andwith goodreason —
if he didn’t, Fred would clearly be the villain. He
might be clever, but he certainly isn’tlikeab1e.

The movie has only one ofﬁcial antagonist
Kevin Spacey is perfectly icy as Clyde, a repre-
sentative from a mysterious board in charge of
governing the holidays. Clyde is eager to ﬁnd a
reason to shut down Santa for good, and Fred
gives him plenty.

Of course,Fredwi1lhavehisrequisite change
of heart later on and try toredeemhimselfby cli-
mactically saving Christmas, delivering an end-
ingwrappedupneaterthanagiftonthe24th.

Christmas movies have a tendency to por-

tray it as a holiday that requires regular saving,

be it ﬁom thieves, ghouls or rrraybe just a lack —

of Christmas spirit At any rate, ﬂre typical last-
minute underdog effort to make the holiday hap
pen is hardly original, and only a tremendous
amount of heart and sincerity, like in 2003’s
“Elf,” can pull it off without becoming trite.
“Fred Claus” is lacking in both, however, in-
stead reveling in cynicism and ﬂash. The North
Pole is certainly beautiﬁrl — the massive and in-
tricate sets make up a fully realized, ﬁrnctioning
backbone to the Christmas operation Still, it’s
nothing more than a shiny distraction, a colorful
set piece just waiting to be destroyed by slap-

   
    



 

stick ﬁghting, snowmobile hijacking and elﬁsh
moshpits.

The only thing that rings true is Paul Gianrat—
ti as Santa, whose jolly attitude and eagerness
to please consistently leave him vulnerable to
Fred’s callousness. It quickly reaches the. point
where you feel sony for Santa, who would have
been justiﬁed leaving Fred in jail in the ﬁrst act.

Whether or not Fred is able to save Christ-
mas, it would take more than a convenient
change of heart to save this movie. Just like the
traditional gift of fruitcake, this Christmas oﬂ’er—

ing is no more than an empty gesture, ultimately 0

unsavory and easily forgettable. r

(Vince Vaughn) ﬁnds himself the unwilling recipient.

Galactic, page 8

TPN: Sofar, how do you thinkyour new album
has been received by fans?

RM: It’s tough [to tell]. I think that we have a lot
of dilferent kinds of people in our fanbase. There

arethefansthatwantustomakeourﬁrstalbum

over and over again. There are some that appre-
ciateus doing new stulf. Ithinkthe general public
likes it more than our fanbase.

TPN: Well, considering that this album is mark-

ealy dtﬁerentﬁom anything you ’ve done in the
past, would you say you keep your fans in mind

" — when writing or do you write more for your-

selves?

RM: Ikindadon’t [keepfans inmindwhilewn't—

kinda ‘screwed When you’re writing for your
fans, you’re not doing what you wanna do —

—. _» you’re not gonna be happy in your heart in the

longrun. You hope they come ayearﬁomnowto
see you, but if they don’t, maybe you need some
new fans. - \. .

TPN: About the  itself: Did you intention-

 ally start out to make a Galactic-meets-hip-hop

ordid it just fall into place thatway?

 RM: We didn’t really set out like we were gonna
’makeahip-hopalbumWhen weﬁrststarted

making the album, we said “Let’s make an al-

 burn and collaborate but still do what we do.”

We didn’t want just an instrumental album, we
wanted it to have some guests.

 TPN: The theme ofthe album is about comers,
»  ‘ hence the title. lbu told the MCs to write about
 acomer — any comet; in anyway, itdidntmat-’
 _ ten So, how did this conceptualpart ofthe album
 originate?   » ‘ P

 RM: The ‘concept’cameupbecausewe thought
 “Howcanwedoit with aspeciﬁc theme, not just
3% guests?” You see that too much, those kinds of

[collaboration] albums are too all over the place.

 People have lost the idea of an album being an

 album. but that’s why 1 got into music. We really

 wanted for it to have a cohesive feel. we didn’t
 want ll‘l€ theme of ﬂreir songs to be all over the

 place. At the same time, we wanted it to be spe-

 ciﬁc but not make, every song about the same

 thing. We went back and forth, had a bunch of
 ideas. Eventually, we came across a book by a

 New Orleans author about different comers in

 New Orleans. It’s really cool.

 JPN: lbu guys started working on the album
 before Hurricane Katrina butdidn’tstartrecord—
 ing it until after the storm. As a result, you-had to
 record in a dtﬁerent studio than usual [Red Rock
 Recording in the Poconos Mountains]. How did

storm, we had all these feelings we were going
through It brought the band closer, brought the
feeling like ‘we really need to  sorr1e-
thing right now.’ Since we didn’t write any of the
lyrics, there was no way we were getting across
how we were feeling vocally. It made us feel like
we had to produce something good

TPN: It’s almost impos.sible- to talk about music
coming from New Orleans today and not con-

sider there to be a pre-Katrina and post—Katrina
world. How would you say the storm has aﬂected
your music?

RM: Again,probably it brought everyone closer.
In a way, any sort of disaster brings neighbors
closer. Initially, we did a bunch of New-Orleans-

P themed toms. We allkinda fell backin love with

the New Orleans sound Once you see what you
rnight’ve lost, you appreciate it a little more. It re-
invigorated everyone’s love of New Orieans.

sports

by Andrew Chikes
Se/zior Stczﬂ Wrder

There are _few things in sports as ex-
citing as watching the development of
a young player or team. p

The maturation process turns raw
talent into efficient, productive on-
field products, capable of achieving

_ great things. »

Pitt fans are fortunate enough to be
watching the evolution of two young
players with star potential in freshman
quarterback Pat Bostick and freshman

" running back LeSean McCoy.

Both players contributed heavily to
the victory over the Syracuse Orange
Saturday at Heinz Field.

McCoy rushed for 140 yards and a
touchdown. For his efforts, the fresh-
man was awarded Big East Offensive
Player of the Week.

He became the first Pitt freshman to
earn the weekly award since wide re-
ceiver Larry Fitzgerald in 2002.

Through nine games, McCoy now

‘has 1,062 yards, placing him behind

only Tony Dorsett (1,686) and Curvin
Richards (1,228) on the Panthers’ all-
time single-season freshman rushing
list.

Pete Madia / Photo Editor

LeSean McCoy does his Heisman step in Pitt's 20-17 win over Syracuse on Saturday at
Heinz Field. McCoy was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Week this week.

He’s also twoptouchdowns shy of
Dorsett’s freshman rushing touchdown
record of 13. t

“I eventually thought I’d get 1,000
yards, but I didn’t think I’d get it in my
first season,” McCoy said.

“I didn’t know I’d get this much
playing time so I’m excited, but again
this is all about the team.”

McCoy is the leading freshman
rusher in the nation and only the sec-

ond freshman running back in Big East
history to eclipse 1,000 yards.

West Virginia’s Steve Slaton was the
first. . r
“We knew what type of player
LeSean McCoy was coming out of high
school,” Pitt head coach Dave Wannst-
edt said.

“Did I think he could be this type of
player this quick?

“Yes, I did.”

Pair of losses set back volleyball

by Evan Burgos

[V-.9[cz_/f Writer

,. Pitt volleyball had a bumpy road trip this
past weekend, falling to Big East rivals Cin-
cinnati and No. 21 Louisville, respectively, on
Saturday and Sunday.

 Despite two brilliant performances by se-
nior leader Diana Andreyko, who recorded
her 10th and 11th double—doubles of the year,
the Panthers (14-13, 7-6 Big East) managed to
win only one game. They were defeated 3-0 by
Cincirmati and 3-1 by Louisville.

A The squad has now lost three consecutive
matches after two wins against West Virginia
and Marquette. This year the Panthers have
been impressive at times, but inconsistencies
have relegated them to the middle of the Big
East pack. Louisville holds a perfect confer-

 record at 12-0, while Cincinnati owns an
8-4 clip.

Chad, this
is no time
to tango

by Nlike Gladysz
Staﬂ Writer

I hate dancing. I try my hardest to avoid it
but lately, I haven’t been able to. Somehow, it
has broken into something I love, something I
need and something in which it doesn’t belong
— football. ~ I

I was sitting with my roommate, ﬂipping
back and forth between, games when it ﬁrst
hit me. I saw a score update from the Bengals
game, so I quickly turned the channel to see
what happened ,

It was a decent touchdown. Chad Johnson
made the catch. But it was his end zone cel-

ebration afterwards that caught my attention.

And man, did it make me mad.

“I swear if‘I see one more of these clowns
dancing around the end zone, I’m going to put
my head through this wall,” I said.

Thirty minutes, $150 worth of damage and
a colossal headache later, I decided to turn foot-
ball 011° for the rest of the night Really, in what
other sport do we see this? Aside from Barry
Bonds’ 45-minute stroll around the bases after
every home run and Jonathan Papelbon’s Irish
Jig, baseball doesn’t have this problem.

- The ﬁghts in hockey aren’t something to
be proud of, but they’ve been part of the -game
since the beginning, and when a goalie makes

a key save, he doesn’t pull his cell phone out 9

from behind the net to make a call.

Then there’s the NBA. Well, unless crying
and throwing sucker-punches is considered a
celebration, those guys aren’t too bad either.
Call me a grouch or a loser. But touchdown
celebrations have- reached a level _of unprofes-
sionalism and disgrace that would make Mike
Tyson cringe.

Yes, entertainment is important, and as
fans, we want to be entertained But these guys
needtorealizethatagoodgarneisentertain-
ing enough. The one-handed touchdown grab
is enough, Chad. We don’t need to see you give
the ball CPR. And ﬂapping your arms like a
demented bird, T.O.? That doesn’t accomplish
anything but, well, rrraking you look like a de-
mented bird .

It’s embarrassing for teams, organizations,
the players around them and ﬂre league. Why
do you think Randy Moss toned down his end-

November 7, 2007

by Emily Steiner
Staﬂ Wrtler

The competition between Pitt and Cin-
cinnati was over well before the end of
Saturday’s swimming and diving home
opener. '

The Pitt men’s and women’s teams
dominated the Bearcats with scores of
146-89 and 140-89, respectively.

After winning nearly every event, Pitt
decided to make some of their races exhi-
bitions, so as not to run up the score. Had
Pitt decided not to exhibition several of
the events it won, the margin of its wins
would’ve been much larger.

Pitt senior Jeremy Stultz topped his
own school record of 396.67 in the 3M
diving competition, winning the event
with a score of 406.28. He also won the
1M event with a 379.95.

“I think our men divers just really did
the trick,” Pitt head coach Chuck Knoles
said. “Every male diver that competed
made their qualifying standard for the Big
East.” ' i

The Bearcats didn’t bring any male div-
ers with them, giving the men the chance
to work on individual skills rather than
placing against competitors. Having that

 

chance paid off.

“Even if they [Cincinnati] would’ve
had divers, it would’ve been difﬁcult for
them to score,” Knoles said. “To have that
many qualiﬁers this early in the season, it
really speaks well for our team.”

Other than Stultz, the male divers to
compete and qualify were Eric Becker, Ja-
son Erdeljac, Colin Forner, Charles Haus-
er and Zane McLain.

The talent within the women’s swim
team was evident all day. The women won
every event and swept the ﬁrst three places
of nine events.

Junior Stacie Safritt was a triple-winner,
leading the way with wins in the 50-yard
freestyle, 100 free and 400 free relay.

This is the third meet in a row that Sa-
fritt has been a triple-winner. She did it on
the road at St. Bonaventure and again at
Syracuse. '

Freshman Kristin McMullan and senior
Kelly O’Hara tied in the 50 free to sweep
the event, while McMullan followed
sophomore Megan Scully to ﬁnish out the
top three in the 100—meter freestyle.

Also standing out for the Pitt women
was freshman Katie Cutrell, who won the

1,000-yard freestyle by more than 13 sec— _

onds and also came in ﬁrst in the 500 free
event.

Sophomores Margo Ekstrom and Ruth
Seiffert rounded _out the multiple-event
winners for the women.

Ekstrom won both the 1M and 3M
diving events, and Seiffert won the 200
breaststroke and the 200 individual med-
ley, an event in which all four of Pitt’s
competitors were body lengths ahead of
anyone in red and black.

Other winners for the Panthers were
Sarah Looney (200 free), Margo Ekstrom
(IM and 3M diving), Brittany Stevens
(200 butterﬂy), Ryann Kishbaugh (200
backstroke) and the members of the 400
medley (Kishbaugh, Laura Barnes, Ste-
vens and Megan Sculley) and 400 free-
style (Safritt, Sculley, McMullan and Ag-
nes Mago) relays.

“We had a very nice performance by the
men and the women,” Knoles said.. “We
are very tired so I was on pins and needles
to see how strong these kids would be to
swim fast while tired. I was very enthused
that they could come in there and swim
fast while they were tired, which is what
we need to do to get better.”

The men also produced winners in the

 Pitt swimming and diving dominates‘

majority of their events, losing only four
events to the Bearcats. V

Freshman Alex McLaren was the
front man for the Panthers. He was mi?"
only swimmer to win multiple individual
events while also contributing to the win-
ning 400-yard free relay.

McLaren won the 200 backstroke and
the 200 free, a close race in which he just
out—touched teammate and competitor if
Andy Kyrejko by half a second with a
time of 1:44.32. A

At the end of the meet, senior Warren
Barnes also came through with a win in a
race that was tight from the start. He beat
out Cincinnati’s Jeremy Peter by 0.69 sec-
onds.

Other winners included Zach Phillips
(1,000 free), Adam Plutecki (200 IlV[) and
members of the 400 freestyle relay team
(Andrzej Dubiel, Plutecki, McLaren andk
Patrick Mansﬁeld).

The Panthers will host Notre Dame at
home on Friday at 3 p.m. Coach Knoles
is hoping to “pack the pool” with support-
ers.

“We’re really excited about Friday,”
Knoles said. “We could use as much help
from our fans as we can get.”

Bostick, meanwhile, completed 21

one touchdown in the victory over Syr-

throwing at least one in each of his first
five games.

 “Pat Bostick is coming along,”
Wannstedt said. “He’s protecting the

Another ‘young player rneriting some

attention is redshirt freshman defensive
end Greg Romeus;

Romeus notched another sack in the
win over the Orange and has been a
force all season long after making his
way into the ‘defensive line rotation
implemented by Wannstedt. C

_ “All game we were getting a lot of
pressure on the quarterback,” Romeus

said. “Making that final sack felt great.

It’s good to go out and execute.”

Pitt has a bye this week leading up
to its November 17th clash with Rut-
gets.

stars to continue their rapid progres-

How our chicken is raised, naturally, makes all the difference.

_ In fact, both the chicken and pork we serve in Pittsburgh
 are free of antibiotics and added growth hormones,
d fed a vegetarian diet and raised humanely.
We think that meat raised naturally is better.

Serving naturally raised meat is another step in our
ongoing Food With Integrity journey ~— bringing you
the best ingredients from the best sources.
