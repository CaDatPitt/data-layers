Meanwhile the Allied Collegi-

the elections committee to gain
recognition as a party. The com-
mittee refused to discuss the AC
party petition last Wednesday be-

deadline. .

Actually ;the deadline was 3
p.m., ‘last VVedncsda.y, but the
committee, meeting at that. time.
extended it to 5 p.m. VVhen,

after repeated warnings from
the committee, Chris Gillotti,

AC chairman, failed to submit

the petition ‘until 5:04 p.m., the

committee said they would do
nothing about the petition unless

a claim were ﬁled. _

Gillotti has asked Ed.Dona1dson,

elections committee chairman, to
call a "special meeting to hear the
AC plea. ,
, “We feel that the election com-
mittee wants a two-party race.
»We. will ask them to give us a-
break because of this.”

The PAP was recognized
without any trouble. Its . peti-
tion wasn’t turned in until 3:07
p.m., but the ,two—hour exten-
sion made it legal.  _

The University has failed in its obligation to provide an
atmosphere compatible with good television. The value of

communication by this means cannot be overestimated.

Untold possibilities for good television programming
exist in this University, and an educational television chan-
nel which functions almost next‘ door’ would be quite con-

tent to show any good programs which are available. '

  ce...i.

The top ranking WQED show, Pitt Huddle, has the Uni- .

versityfs name attached ‘to it, but the encouragement of the

program by the University‘ ends there. Dr. Carlson" alone is ,

responsible. , .

Tom Coleman, former health professions “ public rela-
tions consultant, for the University, organized some ﬁne pre-

I sentations for the health area. Since "his departure, which
was a great loss to this University, the program even in the

health area, which is a strong point, has declined.

T. F. X. Higgins has done ﬁne work through the Foreign
Policy Association (located here in the University in tele-
vision programming. He has been able,to work a program

into the shape that it was saleable. 

‘ Pbyi the contact ‘

Dr. Robert Newman has produced a newsworthy panel

show through the William Pitt Debate ‘Union.-

But these are isolated instances of individual initiative"

on the part of faculty or administrative members. There

of programming, one advantage. of which ‘might be co-
operative speakers with WQED for television and midday
series appearances. ‘P '
This is a flaw in the rapid _development of the University
whichneeds correction. The University can provide a serv-
ice to the community,°_a_m‘edium of communication for our
outstanding faeulty members,-

Dr. Hyman Lumer may not have told University stu-

dents very much about Communism they did not already
know, but it was nevertheless a‘ momentousaction by the
YM—YWCA to invite him there. ’

Too often, college students succumb to the emotional

unrealism_'of society in general concerning the Communist
‘menace. ‘If I bury my head in_the sand, it will go away.”
Unfortunately, this works no better for the human be-
ing than___it does for the ostrich,’ Just because Communism is
in conﬁict, econoinically and otherwise, with capitalism and
democracy, is no reason not ‘to hear a believerin the ideol-
The fact that Dr. Lumer was served a subpoena while

a chicken cackle and the last

. By Joe -Ungior _ ,
Back in the’ 1940's -there was a,radio -program
ealled"“The Shadow.” It concerned an easy-going‘

man about town who, according-mto the announcer,

had discovered the power of ‘ “clouding men’s

minds” so they could not see him. V\ ‘ \
Besides this attribute he had a quired‘

laugh .—-_ sort ofja cross between  l '

 

gasp‘ of a wounded boar -

wits out of unsuspecting crimi-
nals and -immature listeners. He '
was a real matinee terror.

One day Mr. John Pack, now
a physicist at_Westinghouse hap-
pened to hear a -“Shadow” epi-
sode. As a result" he developed   .
an interest in what has become a rather highly-
pursuedlhobby. No, he does not spend his spare

“hours trying to perfect a wierd laugh.

It was the other ‘half ‘of -the Shadow’.s' nature,
the power to “cloud men’s minds,” that caught ‘his
fancy._’So Mr. Pack has studiedand become an
amateur hypnotist. (One never knows about the
inspirational value of some things.)

Recently Pack performed at a University pro-

‘ ‘gram’ sponsoredby Alpha Epsilon'Delta‘ and Quaxf

Although he managed to hypnotize four co-op-

erative students, he centered the demonstration on-5:...

only one, a red-headed-e coed who evidently ap-

pealed to him as the best’ subject.

I

No Svengali Stunts  . .

Not interested in the spectacular, however, he
attempted no Svengali stunts, but"m’érely~ had her
early out simple tasks thatseemed mildly repiti-,
tious. Still, the show was impressive._

But also impressive, in a way, were come of the
comments preceding the demonstration. Pack open-
‘ed with a brief .history of hypnotism. He hinted
that the “deep .sleep” during which Adam under-
went rib surgery may be an expression revealing
a very early knowledge of hypnosis. _

Then, after covering some Egyptian, _Roma,n,
Middle Age, and Eighteenth Century ideas, he
spoke of Freud’s book, “Psychoanalysis and Telep-
athy.’f Here Freud mentioned that certain individ-
uals, while being psychoanalyzed, related events
which he, not they, I had actually experienced.
Through complete relaxation they were able to
utilize unknown telepathic faculties. (Telepathy is
supposedly a close relative of hypnotism.)

Bringing the history up to date, ‘Pack reminded
his audience that last year hypnotism was ac-

cepted as a medical tool. It is used in two basic

  Minds, 

A wierd 

  
   

ailments 'as insomnia, ‘alcoholism, asthma, many
other nervous stresses, and even‘ various types of

— heart disorders.

_ _ As an-anesthetic in operations (thyroidectornies,

appendectomies, ‘and severalrecorded amputations ,

in India), it results in better and quicker healing
since no foreign chemicals need be introduced into
the body. In fact, a leading Chicago anesthetist
has labeled it the “best ever used.” _
Excife,'l'he Subconscious ’ . ‘
Pack also dealt with the bearing of hypnotism
on extra-sensory perception. He pointed out that
although any direct connection is currently doubt-
ful, hypnotism “can stabalize a subject and excite

‘ his subconscious mind.”

For example, if a person is put into a ‘deep
trance andiinformed that he has x-ray vision his
ability to identify hidden objects seems to increase.

Along this’ line, Pack told of the /hypnotized
woman who was supposed to visualize an object
which he had placed on the kitchen table of a
neighbor’s house. She claimed to get the picture of
a suspended black slip. Actually, it was a black,

.inverted, waste-basket, but because of the obvious

geometric’ similarity, Pack
ment a hit. ‘

Perhaps some of the most appealing comments
were those concerning certain humorous occur-
rences. Pack described an odd case of age regres-
sion. A hypndtist took his subject back through
the years, having him stop at speciﬁc points to
recall past happenings.

_ Too Permanent Regression

They proceeded rapidly. Suddenly the subject
stoppedtalking, And when aroused, the poor man
not only retained‘ this loss of speech, but was also
incapable of walking and, furthermore, had no idea

‘ -iewho he was. The regression had been highly suc-
cessful. Months of re-education and a seventy—ﬁve
«thousand dollar suit followed.

Then there was the bored hospital patient who,
for amusement, practiced autohypnosis. By putting
himself under he could , create playmates. His

ture that brightened many an afternoon with its
clever antics.

But unfortunately, when theman left the hos-,

pital the friendly bear tagged along. Of course its
upkeep was ‘negligible but eventually complica-
tions arose and a professional ’hypnotist was sum-
moned to remove the lovable beast. A unique and
undoubtedly bloodless extermination.

' As both a performer and speaker, Pack pro-
vided some entertaining moments. And not even
once did he revert to Shadow tricks and make

Such people as ‘a letter writer

who, claimed that the announce-

amples of ‘American Legion pa-
triotism which is hardly credit-

The solution to the‘ Commu-

‘steady diet of democracy, to the

Anyone who heard Dr. Lum-

are more solidly in favor of the

one yet devised, namely Demo-

Panthers Finish 5th in

By JACK SMITH
Capturing a first place, a third
and a fourth, the Panther track-
men, under Coach Carl Rees,
gained ten points and a ﬁfth place

in the IC4A championship Satur-
day night at New York.

The mile ‘relay team of Zinner-
ford Smith, Jay Moody,~ Vince
Wojnar and Mel Barnwell won
its event with ‘a time of 3:18.2
for a new IC4A record. Smith got
the Panthers off to a good start
in the opening lap and the team
was never headed. Barnwell,
however, was pressed by Villa-
nova’s Ed Collymore in the ﬁnal
quarter-mile.

In the

60-yard dash Mel

Barnwell got off to a. bad start
and ﬁnished third. Villa-nova’s
Ed Collymore, won the dash in
6.2, as expected.

The only other point getter for
the -Blue and Gold was Ron Rush
who placed fourth in the mile
with a time of 4:19.’? ‘

John Christoﬂf placed first in
his heat of the two-mile run, com-
ing from 40 yards behind in the
last lap. His winning heat time of
9236.3 was the best he has ever
run, but he didn’t place in the
ﬁnals due to a slow heat.‘

“I‘m very pleased with the out-

‘All-American Saves
, Best for Fi11alGame

Don Sparkles
In 84.-65 Will;
Mills Hits 29

By LARRY HAGGERTY

After receiving word from
St. Louis that he had been
named to the ﬁrst team of the
“Sporting News” All—Ameri-
can basketball squad, Don
Hennon showed the capacity
crowd of 5,447 at the Field House
why he deserved this distinguish-
ed honor as he paced his Panther
teammates to an easy 84-65 vic-
tory over Penn State.

Thus the 1958-59 season ended
on a happy note for Coach Bob
Timmons’ boys even though they
had a poor season’s record of
10-14. The Panthers assumed a
14-12 lead on a jump shot by
Hennon and never trailed again.
They took a 37-29 lead to the
dressing room and didn’t allow
the Lions to get any closer than
six points in the ﬁnal stanza.

Penn State tried to bottle up
the Panthers’ attack with a
pressing zone defense, but Hen-
non took care of this minor de-
tail with a display of fancy
dribbling and a various assort-
ment of behind-the-back passes
to teammates open underneath
the basket.

Hennon scored 18 points and

i also recorded 12 assists to bring

to an end a fabulous career that

—had its origin at Wampum High

School some eight years ago. Most
of the All-American’s passes
found John Mills, and as a re-
sult the Panther forward tallied
29 points. Mark DuMars scored 20
for the Lions and Dave Sawyer
hit 18 for ,the winners.

Sawyer, -the 6-6 forward from
Mt. Morris, N.Y., also closed his
collegiate career on a brilliant
note but could only talk of Hen-
non’s brilliant performance in the
dressing room after the encoun-
ter. ‘;

“Even if Donnie hadn’t scored
a single point in this game he
still would have deserved his
All-American rating,” Sawyer
said. “He is the greatest player
that I have ever seen and it will
‘be a crime if he doesn’t‘make
every All-American team,” he
concluded.

Besides Hennon and Sawyer,
Panthers John Mesher and Bill

‘Shay also played their ﬁnal game

in Blue and Gold. Mesher had a
large part in enabling the Jungle
Cats to win as many games as
they did after _breaking into the
starting lineup eleven games ago.

American Communist

Served with Subpoena After‘ Speech

. By DEBORAH WILLSON ‘ e
Dr. Hyman Lumer, the Communist Party Secretary of
Education who addressed students at the Thursday Mid-day
Series, was served, after his speech, with “a subpoena by a
Federal Marshall to appear before the Un-American Activi-

ties Committee in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Lumer, who has appeared before ,such‘c’ommittees

Dr. H. Lumer

 

previously, stated that
other party members in the Pitts-
burgh area had been subpoenaed
_also. "

He felt that the action of the
committee was a “bid for pub-
licity” since he intended to follow
the general policy of refusing to

. answer -all, or most of the ques-

tions asked him. —
hiain Headquarters New"«York
At an interview, Dr. Lumer, in

"speaking of the Communist Party
, organization in’ this country, said

that the main headquarters exists
in New York City.

He estimated the ‘“card'-ca‘r-

rying” membership of the party '

to be about 10,000, a number
less than the membership of a

» few years before.

Dr. Lumar_ made- it clear that

“there are no youth groups on the
-campuses

of American colleges
aﬁiliatecl » with the Communist
party,” though there are 5 or 6
colleges which permit organiza-
tions with “extremely liberal
views."
Audience Numbers 700

The audience Dr. Lumer ad-
dressed at P_itt, he said, was the
largest he had appeared ‘before.

Dr. Lumer explained also. at
the interview, that his duties as
Secretary of Education of the
American. Communist Party

V consists mainly of the “superv-

, vision of the Party’s attempt to
bring their views before the

. American public.”

the American Communist Party is
not a branch of the Russian Party
and is not supported ﬁnancially
or otherwise by its inﬂuence. 0
Relationship ‘Fraternal’

He felt the relationship between
the parties‘ to be a “fraternal”
one, much the same as between
trade unions of various countries,
which exchange information but
do -not attempt to inﬂuence one‘
another’s policies, ‘ »_

"When: questioned about the *

'party’s' stand on religion, Dr.
Lumer several times stated-that

he felt there should be no inter- V . 

ference with the religious views
of any individual. '
He said, “I would not approve a
state church‘ but would ‘not favor
suppression of any religion, even
if its basic beliefs conﬂict ‘with
his.” ‘
Answers Evasively _ ._
At the afternoon discussion Dr.
Lumer was questioned about
many existing situations in West-

ern Europe, such as the ‘station-

ing of Communist troops in Ber-
lin and t_he.supression of the Hun-
garian revolution. In most cases,
Dr.‘ Lumer answered‘ evasively,
saying merely that the facts were
so controversial that no one posi-
tion could be adequately defended.
When confronted by ’ evidence
' of violence presented by a Hun-
garian student 'present in min-
gary during, the revolution, he
.again said -only that he knew
people who “thought g,‘ other-

States Party Policies

In conclusion, Dr. ‘Lumer fat-..«.
tempted ‘to outline brieﬂy the‘pol-
icies supported by the Communist
Party. ' _ i ~

Such policies are, for example,
free trade with Russia, equal
rights and education for the Negro
race, and beneﬁts for labor.

He _claimed, “Socialism will

Responsible training-program assignments offer ‘varied expe-
rience, and a chance to select the work you prefer for long-range
growth. For example, ,let’s examine the present training. of
Larry Wood, class of '58: 

Larry chose the Navigational Systems Laboratory for his initial
assignment. Here, he is working on the inertial guidance sys- .
tem for the SUBROC missile; he selects. components such as
networks and gear .trains, speciﬁes parameters such as ampliﬁer
gain, and is studying possible alternates to the presentsystem.

‘If Larry requests permanent assignment in this’_Lab,: he ‘will
write design speciﬁcations, sketch originals, and ‘supervise
draftsmen in the preparation of ﬁnal prints.‘ Heiiwill coordinate
the efforts of engineers from supporting groups, supervise tech-,
nicians performing ﬁnal systemsizestse and developing required
supporting test equipment. ’  Q 0 ' ‘

Larry is helping Kearfott grow, and he is

growing with it. Similar opportunities exist

for this year's EE and _ME graduates. Please
