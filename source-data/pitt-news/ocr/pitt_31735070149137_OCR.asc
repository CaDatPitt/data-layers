if ThroughoutAugust, new head coach

Paul Chrystand the Pitt football team

spent each day at their facility on the

South Side, partaking in a grueling
training camp to prepare for the up-

coming2o12 campaign. Leading up
to our Football Preview on Friday,

The Pitt News is proud to present a

three—part series titled “Inside Camp”
to give you a close-up ofwhat life at
training camp was like for the 2012

Panthers.

PART TWO: UNVVINDING FROM
THE DAY .

Each summer when training camp
rolls around for the Pitt football team,
it’s back to seeing the same faces day
inand day out _for seniorwide receiver
Cameron Saddler.

“I haven’t seen anyone different,”
Saddler said following a practice of
the familiar monotony. “I’m tired of
looking at [senior wide receiver Mike]
Shanahan.”

A The always cheerﬁil Saddler joked
that by the midway point of August,
his tolerance for his fellow receiver
had hit new lows.

“He sits directly across from me
at meetings, and I’m so tired of look-
ing at him,” Saddler said with tongue
planted ﬁrmly in cheek, as usual.

After spending literally all day
with each other in close proximity
during training camp, practicing each
day at Pitt’s South Side facility for at
least three hours .— and sometimes

Team of researchers work to
discover universal vaccine

Matt Schaff
Senior Staff Writer

Inﬂuenza outbreaks work like a
[circle dance: People boogie with a
certain virus one year, trade it for

A another type and then another, and

some time later the original dance
partner makes a second debut.
Scientists used to think that ini-
tial exposure to a virus conferred
a person with a unique protection
for when it returned many years
later. But thanks to researchers at
Pitt, we now know that the diver-

sity of ﬂu dance partners in be-

tween couldbe equally protective
and could even teach us to produce
better vaccines.

Publishing their ﬁndings injuly
in the science and medicine jour-
nal PLOS ONE, Ted Ross, associate
professor in the Department of Mi-
crobiology and Molecular Genetics
at Pitt, and his research group ran
a study that suggests that a life-

  
 

time of exposure to a variety of ﬂu
strains can provide immunity to a
totally new strain.

And that immunity — the abil-
ity for the immune system to pro-
tect the body against infection ——~
can be just as robust as in people
with long-ago exposure to a nearly
identical version of that new strain.

“When someone has seen sev-
eral, they can be resistant to other,
unrelated strains,” Ross said. “It
takes years of infection to build
up immunity.”

Past trends in viruses

These new ideas represent a re-
sponse to a recent trend in virus
research: The urge to make much
of the relationship betweenthe
2009 swine ﬂu and the infamously
deadly 1918 “Spanish” ﬂu.

The trend began when scien-
tists noticed in 2009 that elderly
adults were disproportionately

spared from severe infection with
the swine ﬂu, or H1N1.

The excitement accelerated
when researchers in California and
China found similarities between
the structural building blocks of
the 1918 and 2009 viruses, both
H1N1, that go beyond the normal
likenesses shared by seasonal
H1N1 strains. , ‘

The idea then emerged that el-
derly people were more protected
against the 2009 swine ﬂu as a re-
sult of immunity developed early
in life toward its 1918 predecessor.

But now the research group
thinks that’s only part of the ex-
planation. ,

The old narrative “doesn’t ex-

plain why [the 2oo9 ﬂu] was so —

much more prevalent in the young
than even middle-aged individu-
als,” Don Carter, lab technician
and ﬁrst author of the study, said

Romney
sweeps
nomination

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

It’s official: Mitt Romney won the
GOP nomination for president.

Delegates at the Republican
National Convention in Tampa,
Fla., chose Romney as their presi-
dential nominee Tuesday night.

Shortly after 6 p.m. on Tues-
day, Speaker of the House John
Boehner announced that Romney
oﬂicially secured the Republican
nomination with 2,061 votes.

. Though Romney has been
considered the presumptive Re-
publican presidential nominee
for months, the current Massa-
chusetts governor needed 1,144
votes to clinch the Republican
Party’s nomination. He pushed
over that mark at about 5:40'p.m.
on Tuesday with 50 votes from
Newjersey.

And while the media has been
all over the assumption that Rep.
Paul Ryan would be Romney’s run-
ning mate, the convention also
served as a time to solidify him
as the vice presidential candidate.

‘ Pennsylvania awarded 67 votes

to Romney and ﬁve votes to Rep.

Ron Paul. Whileannouncing the
Pennsylvania vote tally, Gov. Tom
Corbett mistakenly attributed the
ﬁve votes not given to Romney
as belonging to vice presidential
nominee Ryan.

Ron Paul’s votes were not an-
nounced at the convention po-
dium.

The delegates also approved

_ a conservative platform for the

R0 mney/ Ryan ticket that in-
cludes tax cuts — not government

in an email. “Our paper explores
the idea that a diversity of infec-
tions give broader protection and
helped protect against the pan-
demic strain because it was evo-
lutionarily -more primitive.”

The present study

In the study, the research
group, led by Carter, analyzed al-
most 1,000 blood samples taken
in 2009 from anonymous human
donors participating in UPMC clin-
ical laboratories. So that change
over time could be assessed, the
samples were taken from donors
of a wide age range (1 month to
90 years). The blood was then
spun down to isolate the intrud-
er-targeting substance in blood:
antibodies.

Antibodies work by physically
attaching to foreign material in-
vading the blood — that could
mean viruses, bacteria or even
debris — and then helping trig-
ger the immune system to destroy
that material.

Since the body responds to
intruders by producing intruder-
specific antibodies, the group
could learn about the subjects’
immune system histories by‘ ex-
posing their antibodies to different
historical viruses and seeing which
antibodies attached to, or reacted
with, which viruses. Applying this
procedure with the 1918 and 2009
viruses and several seasonal vi-
ruses in between, the results were
jolting.

Sure enough, the old narrative

turned out to have some foot-
ing: Many of the antibodies that
reacted with the 1918 virus also
reacted with the novel 2009 virus.
But that relationship was surpris-
ingly far from perfect. According
to the study, antibodies in the lion’s
share of blood samples reacted ei-

ther with one virus or the other, '

but not both.

Additionally, the samples most
likely to show this “cross-reactivi-
ty” were not of the elderly, whose
exposure to the 1918 virus should
prime them for the 2009 strain,
but of the middle-aged donors,
who could have only interacted
with distant relatives of the Span-
ish ﬂu. On top of that, cross-reac-
tivity was often just as great if not
greater between the 2009 strain
and several seasonal strains.

The ﬁndings poke holes in two
contentions: that the 1918 and
2009 inﬂuenzas are functionally
“identical” and that exposure to

the first is required to build im- <

mune protection for the second.
The future of vaccines

But the ﬁndings do more than
that. .

The group’s research suggests
the possibility that the immune
system can prepare for the future
without yet knowing it. As in the
blood samples with high cross-
reactivity taken from middle-aged
subjects, the body looks like it can
integrate decades of information
about a diversity of viruses to build

— resistance to never—before-seen

viruses.

Having found evidence for this
insight in animal models, Ross as-
signs it wondrous potential for vac-

cine development.
“We could be pre-priming peo-

ple for a strain that does not now .

exist,” he said.

What he’s talking about is a uni-
versal vaccine.

Responding to enthusiastic

- nodding from federal ofﬁcials, this

group and many other researchers
across the country are hot on the
trail of this holy grail of vaccines —
the ability to inoculate against an
unknown inﬂuenza future. What-
ever the strain, the vaccine would
prevent it.

“The 2009 outbreak set the U.S.
government’s mind that we are not
prepared for another pandemic,”
Ross said. “There was a mandate
from the U.S. government to try
to deal with a breadth of viruses.”

Universal vaccines could trans-
form how the government treats
inﬂuenza prevention, according
to Nancy Cox, director of the In-
ﬂuenza Division at the Center for

Disease Control and Prevention.. .

“Public health recommenda-
tions for use of inﬂuenza vaccines
would change to reﬂect the dura-
tion of immunity and the extent of
cross protection for the ‘universal
inﬂuenza vaccine’ that might be
approved (licensed for use) in hu-
mans,” she said in an email.

The research group has built its
“diversity-to-immunity” insight
into its own vaccine prototype,
dubbed “COBRA” (computation-
ally optimized broadly reactive an-
tigen). Using computer modeling,
Ross, Carter and their colleagues
are assembling the relevant pieces
of viruses —— i.e. the sites where an-
tibodies have attached (antigens)
— that have appeared throughout
recorded history into stand-alone,
synthetic vaccines.

With promising animal studies ~

completed, the COBRA project has
been picked up by Sanoﬁ Pasteur,

' the largest vaccine manufacturer

Don Carter, who led a recent influenza study at Pitt, manipulates a micrdpipette in a laboratory atop

in the world.

The company’s optimism
echoes Ross’s.

According to an emailed state-
ment from Sanoﬁ Pasteur spokes-
woman Susan Watkins, the vaccine
prototype “holds the potential to
be adaptable to any delivery meth-
od. It is designed to protect against
whatever strain of seasonal ﬂu hap-
pens to be circulating, and it may
be able to be produced in as little
as four months  The synthetic
ﬂu shot may also be effective far
longer than the traditional ﬂu vac-
cine.”

As plans are hammered out for
clinical trials, a vaccine could be
ready in 10 to 15 years, Ross re-
cently told the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review. ~ _ .

Such a vaccine could come just
in time, given the unpredictable
nature of inﬂuenza pandemics. Af-
ter all, “It’sjust a matter of time till
the next one happens,” Ross said.

Job fair offers opportunities for
‘students in all ﬁelds of study

Parthena Moisiadis
Staff Wrz'ter

More than so companies and organizations

with employment opportunities will meet with
students on Thursday at the William Pitt Union
from 1 to 3 p.m. S .

The Student Employmentjob Fair has been
held for three years in the beginning of both
the fall and spring semesters each year. The
Employmentjob Fair offers federal work study
positions, student work positions and intem-
ships to Pitt students.

Amanda Sell, special events and market-
ing associate at Pitt’s Career Development and
Placement Assistance Office, said this,semes—
ter’s job fair has the largest employer turnout

, for the event yet. She attributed the increase in

employer attendance to the combination ofboth
on—campus employers and local businesses. ‘~
Sell said that the more thanso organizations

set to attend the job fair are based throughout ~
the University and Oakland, as well as Shady— V

side, the Waterfront, Squirrel Hill and Rob-
inson. _
She encouraged all students to attend the
job fair and underlined that although federal
work study and student work positions are
available, opporumities also exist for students
solely searching for part—t:ime employment dur-
ingthe school year. -
Sell stressed that students of all academic
backgrounds should attend the fair.
“Employers are eager to meet with students
that.have a strongwork ethic and are willing to
be ﬂexible with scheduling work hours,” Sell
said.
— Although students are not required to bring

copies of their resume to the fair, Sell recom-
mended that they do so. She said students can
receive help constructing their resumés by
meetingwith a career consultant in the Ofﬁce of
Career Development and PlacementAssistance.

English andﬁlm studies adviser Mark Kemp
said he believes it’s important for all students to
partake in practical experience before gradu-
ation, such as opportunities offered at thejob
Fair.

“It’s very important that they do some think-
ing about what they want to do after they gradu-
ate,” Kemp said. “Internships help to do that
whether or not they have to do  their ﬁeld
of study or not. It can be unrelated and still
give them a good idea of what they want to do
or what they want to avoi .”

This practical experience can often supple-
ment classroom instruction.

Tim Carr, senior adviser at Pitt’s College of
General Studies, said it’s critical that students
have the opportunity to apply what they learn
from their instructors outside of the classroom.

“Students have the chance to be in the actual
setting where they hope to work someday,”
Carr said. “They can actually meetwith people
in the system, not just listening to lectures and
trying to understand it outside of the actual
experience.” ,

Carr also said that students he has advised
over the years have attended events similar to
the fob fair to meet with representatives from
anumber of different agencies. ,

s For those unable to attend the event, Sell said
students can also always search FutureLinks, a
web resource for job openings and internship
availabilities accessible to students via my.pitt.

Rethinking science education to
include critical thinking and discussion

Alex ‘Zimmerman
For The Pitt News

Two weeks ago, I attended a
retreat for incoming students.
Two things surprised me: virtu-
ally everyone planned to enter
STEM fields (science, technol-
ogy, engineering or mathemat-
ics)-and almost none expressed
doubtabout their academic
track. There was one student
interested in ﬁlm studies, but
she quickly reassured me of her
medical school aspirations.

This worries me firstly be—,

cause it demonstrates the extent
to whichwe have criminalized
the answer “I don’t know,”, but,
more importantly, because many
of these students aren’t going to
get the inspiring science educa-
tion they deserve.

Let’s reflect for a moment on
thetypical undergraduate expe-
rience of introductory science at
Pitt. It consists of large lecture
courses, memorization, multiple
choice exams and participation
via “clickers.”

The clicker may have been the
last straw. I successfully com-

,pleted‘49 minutes of college-
level biology until I repeatedly
tried to buzz in with myJeopar-
dy-style signaling device. “What
is,” science?

Admittedly, my passing re-
lationship with science as an
undergraduate came from two
psychology courses and the in-
famous Stonehenge to Hubble

me to think like a scientist or
challenge me to wonder about
scientific explanations of our
world. They asked me _to input
content in an uncritically boring
way. This isn’t how professors
should conduct science educa-
tion.

Our dominant approach to
science education doesn’t just
hurt our STEM students. It hurts
all of us in the humanities and
social sciences. For those who
already think science is their
specialty, most introductory
science courses are merely un-
pleasant hurdles on the way to
smallerclasses that ask more
interesting fundamental ques-
tions. For the rest of us, we miss
an opportunity to be better and
more curious citizens, capable of
intelligently weighing scientiﬁc
arguments.

Obviously, there are excep-
tions to this generalization.
Some students swear by a par-
ticular class, or a professor who
is especially entertaining and
good at teaching large lectures.
Required labs can meaningfully
engage students in hands-on ap-
plications. And then there are
honors courses, which typically
deliver a more intimate science
education to a smaller popula-
tion of students.

But these experiences tend
to be outliers. So why should we
promote soul-crushing classes,
sometimes explicitly designed to
trick us into thinking we are bad
at scienceso we will be “weeded

You’re just frustrated because
science classes are hard, you say.

students commiserating about
the latest curve-busting ques-
tions. Of course science should
be challenging, but we are too
eager to drive away students

who are discouraged by STEM

pedagogy» .

President Barack Obama has
asked for 10,000 new STEM
teachers to revitalize our dis-
mal international rankings in
math and science. If we want
to get serious about producing
the world’s best thinkers, we
need to re—evaluate some of our
close1y—held assumptions about
what excellent science education
should be.

I don’t claim to know what the
right model is, but we need pro-
fessors who are willing to step
outside the pedagogical box. We
need departments to prioritize
an overhaul. I can imagine a sci-
ence class for both scientists and-
humanists that would keep me
glued to PeopleSoft during add/
drop hoping to find an open seat.

It would not treat content as
an end in itself, but as a way of
thinking about pressing con-
temporary problems and gaps
in our knowledge. It would ask
fundamental questions about

Take free speech out of Chick-fil-A debate

Eric Baldwin
For The Pitt News,

We live in a profoundly disappointing mo-

gment where bigotry is conﬁised with free

speech. Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-ﬁl—A, con-
cretized his anti—gay views last month, which
have since provoked a ﬁrestorm of debate in
the public forum. This type of speech is in-

dicative of the increasing polarization of the’

American populace.

Ross Douthat, a New York Times colum-
nist, and a series of speakers on NPR’s “Talk
of the Nation” have argued that Chick-ﬁl—A’s
stance on gay marriage is an exercise of free
speech. In the aftermath of Ca_thy’s bigoted
declaration, the mayors of Philadelphia, Bos-
ton, San Francisco, our own Pittsburgh and
others condemned Chick—ﬁl-A’s presence in
their cities. A major argument that has perme-
ated the public discourse is that Cathy’s com-
ment was nothing more than an exercise in
free speech and that government ﬁgures con-
demning Chick-ﬁl—A are overstepping their
authority and the role of public institutions.

This argument is valid to a certain extent.

This makes me think of what Thomas Jeffer-

son said: “I may not agree with what you say,
but I will defend to the death your right to say
it.” In most cases, I would agree that whatever
remark someone makes is permissible and an
exercise in free speech. In a liberal state, 'we
have an obligation to allow free speech and

dissemination of information, no matter how
intolerant or antithetical it may be to my, or
people of similar mind’s, way of life. However,
the case for gay marriage and gay rights is dif-
ferent. .

The current debate reminds me of a similar
debate and the oppressive struggle of another
minority class: the civil rights movement of
the 1960s. A vast portion of American society
was opposed to integration after the reversal
of the “separate but equal” doctrine. When
public swimming pools were integrated, it is
reported that white racists poured acid into

' pools while African—Americans swam. When

public schools were integrated, white parents
pulled their children out. Fifty years later,
some racism still exists, but the debate over
the merits of integration is over and tolerance
won. - ,

Any rhetoric today that espouses racist
ideology is immediately labeled as bigoted.
The current debate surrounding Chick-ﬁl—A
and gay rights isn’t about free speech — it’s
about recognizing the basic rights of a class of
people who deserve equal treatment and pro-
tection from discrimination and harassment.
Pushing the dialogue toward a debate on free
speech is diverting attention from an uncom-
fortable issue that most Americans don’t want
to talk about. , '

If a prominent businessman announced
his anti—Semitic or racist views, they and their
business would be -undoubtedly condemned

by society and by the law. Why is it any differ-
ent for the gay population? Homosexuals are
still not classiﬁed as a protected class accord-
ing to federal law. Douthat and his contempo-
raries have argued that because of this, public
institutions have no obligation and. should not
take action against corporations that have es-
poused certain values. This is a mist_al<e.Pul5—
lic institutions and their leaders have a moral
obligation to condemn speech that targets a
speciﬁc subset of the population whether or
not they are a protected class as part of an
overall agenda to not allow the malicious tar-
geting of' any group. Mayors and city council
members condemning Cathy’s* comments
are contributing to eliminating bigotry just
as controversial public ﬁgures condemned
racism in the former half of the 20th century
before African-Americans were considered a
protected class. In 50 years, this debate will
seem ridiculous and those who opposed gay
rights will retrospectively be labeled intoler-
ant. '

Until the gay community is considered a
protected class and the level of the dialogue
is elevated to a place where we can engage in
a conversation on the merits of affording gay
people equal rights, then we as a nation still
haven’t learned the difference between hate
speech and free speech. Until then, I suggest
avoiding Chick-ﬁl—A and familiarizing yourself
with the values of the companies you use.

SCIENCE

what it means to be a scientist. It would
encourage experimentation and discus-
sion. I know we have teachers who could
pull this off.

For the incoming pre-med students,
I imagine this might sound like a dreary
forecast for your education. You are, after
all, trying to get into medical school and
many of these introductory courses are
required.'While it’s' true you just can’t
"avoid some ofthese classes, you can keep
an open mind about the education you
seek out. Have an experience that isn’t re-
quired by a medical school. Take a class or
join a club outside of your comfort zone.
Many of you will ultimately change your
minds about the pre-med track, and for
the vast majority, this won’t be because
you couldn’t have been excellent doctors.

Standardized tests rarely tell us any-
thing worth knowing, but it’s revealing
that this year’s freshmen will be the first
to take a new MCAT that will ask for criti-
cal reading and knowledge of the social
sciences. We desperately need doctors
who are humanists just like we need novel-
ists who understand the implications of
climate change. Pitt won’t force you to
be meaningfully exposed to conventions
outside your major. But you can make this
education, if you want to.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

  SPORTS

Freshman midfielder selected Big East Rookie of the Week

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Big East conference has al-
ready recognized the contribu-
tions of Roosa Arvas for helping
the Pitt women’s soccer team
double its win total from last
season.

' The freshman midﬁelder, who
originally hails from Finland, was
named Big East Women’s Soccer

‘Rookie of the Week after scoring

one goal and recording ﬁve as-
sists as the Panthers won all three
games they played last week.
Pitt defeated Robert Mor-
ris 2'-1, St. Bonaventure 2-1 and
Duquesne 3-1 to improve to a 4-1
record after only winning two
games all of last season.
First-year Pitt head coach
Greg Miller said he was very
pleased with his young mid-
ﬁelder’s play early in the season.

“I’m‘ really proud of Roosa’s

contributions through five’

games,” Miller said. “Only five
games intoa completely differ-

ent style_of play for her, and al-

ready she’s found a way to put
her stamp on the game with her
soccer sense and ability to place
the ball where we need it on set
pieces.”

Arvas’s set piece ability has
proved crucial for the Panthers,
with four of Pitt’s seven goals this
weekend coming as a result of the
freshman’s corner kick delivery.

She was also selected as the
College Sports Madness Wom-
en’s Soccer Big East Player of the
Week. A

The Panthers will travel to
Morgantown, W.Va., this week-
end to face Miami (Fla.) and Penn
State at the WVU 90 Minute Clas-
sic as Pitt prepares to enter con-
ference play later this month. I

_ TASSER"S TAKE’

With playoff hopes
fading, Pirates’ goal
should be  record

Donnie Tasser»
Staff Wrz'ter

With the Pittsburgh Pirates los-
ing games at an increasing fre-
quency, I’ve come to a realization:
the franchise is letting me down
‘again. V

The cynical side of my base-
ball—obsessed brain has ﬁnally
conquered the side that actually
thought the Pirates would make
the playoffs. " "

While we can all acknowledge
that«there is still mathematical
hope —— the Pirates are only three
games out of the silly new second
wild-card spot, which would earn
them a game against the ﬁrst wild
card team — the realistic hope is
beginning to fade.

K The team is currently in a
freefall that resembles last sea-

sons’ second—half ﬁasco and every"

prior Pittsburgh baseball season
I can recall from my childhood,
causing reality to _-ﬁnally set in
once again.

With playoff hopes seemingly

. gone, the Pirates’ attention now

turns to the mere goal of reaching
.500 for the ﬁrst time in 20 years.

While this is an admirable goal
-- and truth be told, a goal all Pi-
rate fans should be happy with -
I was greedy this summer. Most of
you, if you are indeed Buccos fans,
undoubtedly felt the same way

' after Pittsburgh’s July hot streak

took the team 16 games above that
elusive .500 mark.

The Pirates were playing gritty
baseball and having fun doing it,
throwing up Zoltan Z’s —— refer-
encing the movie “Dude, Where’s
My Car?” — and keeping pace

INSIDE CAMP

more — the players had virtually no choice

' but to get closely acquainted with each other.

The relationship-building aspect of camp
continued when the team retumed to the dorms
forthe remainder of the evening. Forallbut the
ﬁnal few days of camp, the entire team stayed in
Sutherland Hall, so the players couldn’t avoid
-‘one another, even if they wanted to. But even
Saddler admitted that he needed his teammates
to keep him “sane” throughout the process,
and vice versa. '

Although some of the players, including

g senior center Ryan Turnley, just went straight

to bed most days when they got back, others
preferred to spend an hour or two watching
television or movies, playing video games or
just hanging out. *
“It’s not right to bed [for me] ,” sophomore
running back Isaac Bennett said. “I probably go
to sleep around 10:30 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. ButI

‘ “justeat, ﬁnallytalkto my girlfriend and that’s it.”

Bennett said he also used that precious
downtime simply to chat with teammates and
look over a few plays.

“You probably get an hour or two of free
time [each day] , but you’re still thinking about
football in the back of your mind,” he said.

But once the players ﬁnished along day of
practices and returned to their dorm rooms,
surely the last thing they wanted to watch was
football, right? 1

Wrong.

“SportsCenter” and NFL preseason games

were viewing favorites of many players, es-
pecially when they could watch some of their
former Pitt teammates in action with various
NFL teams.

There were exceptions though, such as mas-
sive, menacing defensive linemen Aaron Donald
and Khaynin Mosley-Smith, roommates who
liked to indulge in a little reality TV every once
in a while when they turned off ESPN.

“‘Love & Hip—Hop: Atlanta’ on VH1, we’re
on that a lot,” Donald said. “That comes on at
night, so we cantry and watch those episodes.”

The players were housed in Sutherland
with most team positions sorted on different
ﬂoors. On each ﬂoor, there were a few rooms
thatbecame the usual gatheringareas, including
Saddler and sophomore Ronald Jones’ room
for the receivers.

“Jones was assigned to bring the TV, and he
brought this little 10-inch TV. He fumbled that
one,” Saddler said, shaking his head. “But one
night, we all crammed in our room and watched
[former Pitt linebacker] Max Gruder play [in an
NFL game] and just talked and ﬂipped through
a couple charmels.”

According to Saddler, players gradually

started dispersing to their own rooms before

11 p.m., and, once everyone was gone, he and
his roommate,Jones, put on music, talked about
practice and eventually fell asleep. -

While the receivers relaxed by watching foot-
ball and television reruns of the ﬁlm “Hancock”
in Saddler’s room to pass time in the evenings,
on the special teams ﬂoor, senior kicker Kevin
Harper —- one of the team’s self—proclaimed

_ biggest jokesters —- picked up where he left

off in the locker room by playing pranks on

the underclassmen. One of his go-to
moves was putting powder on a piece
of paper and taping it to a teammate’s
lockbox so that when he opens it, the
powder, as Harper described, “an-
tiqued him” in the face.

Unsurprisingly, Harper said he
and his fellow special teams mem-
bers watched comedies such as “Team
America: World Police” and “Pine-
apple Express” just about every night.
Like Saddler, it was Harper’s room —
that was typically the popular post-
practice hang-out spot.

“It’s good position bonding be-
cause there’s guys that aren’t my age,
so I don’t usually hang outwith them
outside the football ﬁeld,” Harper
said. “It’s good to just get together

becausetheseareyourposition’splay- Wide l'9c9lVe" cam 53ddl9*' 55

known as one of the

ers, and youive got to be with them more eccentric Panthers. Luv Purohit | Assistantvisual Editor

all year.”

As for his illustrious practical jokes on the
younger guys? ‘

“It’s all good. We all got it when we were
freshmen, and I’rn sure they’lLdo it when they’re
upperclassmen. It’s just good bonding time.”

While the players crammed into Sutherland
— ablastfrom the past for juniors and seniors
who spent their earlier years living there ——
those who now live elsewhere during the school

V year saw their empty off-campus apartments

go temporarily unused.

“Me, Shanahan and Saddler live togetherin
an apartment,” Harper said. “We’ve lived there
three years, and I’m pretty sure we turned the
air conditioning off. Hopeﬁilly we did that.”

Though football activities continued
through Saturday and Sunday, the weekend
did bring a tiny bit of respite for the players.
In Bennett’s case, it ‘might have meant a movie
night with his roommate and star senior run-

ning back Ray Graham.

Thanks to the close-knit nature of training
camp, might there be a “bromance” brewing
in the Pitt backﬁeld? .

“I hate the man, really,” Bennett said, laugh-
ing. “No, I’m just kidding, he’s a ﬁinny guy. We
have all sorts of jokes.”

Camp” in The Pitt News’ Football Preview this

Andrew Mccutchen and the Pirates have struggled for wins in August. MCT Campus

with the much more talented Cincinnati
Reds.

Star‘ center ﬁelder Andrew McCutchen
was the most electrifying player in the
game, veteran pitcher A.J. Burnett was mak-
ing a case for the Cy Young Award’ after

several disastrous seasons in New York,

and even inconsistent third baseman Pedro
Alvarez was on pace to hit 35 home runs and
drive in 100 runs. All was well. ‘
But thenjuly ended, and August brought
disaster.
The Pirates are a putrid 9-16 so far this

month. McCutchen, who was the unani- ’

mous MVP front-runner after a scorching
June and July, has seen his average drop
30 points. Although he still posts fantastic
numbers and may still win the MVP, Mc-
Cutchen spoiled fans beyond repair after
hitting .450 for a two—month stretch. And
Alvarez, while never being very good at
making contact, now seems to have forgot-
ten that he is paid to make contact at all,
and let’s not even discuss his horrendous
defensive play of late.

While the lineup now resembles the hor-

riﬁc offense the team produced in April and’ ‘

May, what’s worse is that the pitching staff,
which picked the team up earlier this year
on numerous occasions when the Pirates
couldn’t hit, isn’t coming through anymore.

The tattooed, angry Burnett — who re-
cently became even more of a fan favorite
after héfenthusiastically suggested for an
opposing hitter to “sit the f *ck down” after

, striking said hitter out — has seen his ERA

climb signiﬁcantly. And the rest of the staff
is pitching considerably worse, yet the team
still won’t give any of its spectacular minor
leaguelstarters an extended try.

At least the Pirates ﬁnally gave up on
struggling pitcher Erik Bedard. Not even
giving up six runs a game would make him
look like he cared. - .

For a while, these Pirates had made this
season» seem special, but now hope is rap-
idly slipping away.

Maybe they still have some magic in
them. Maybe they will go on a 2o11—St.—
Louis-Cardinals—like tear in September and
make their last home stands against the
Reds and the Atlanta Braves meaningful.

I want this team to prove me wrong,
but two. decades of disappointment never
before witnessed by any major professional
sports franchise can jade a person.

I’ve conceded that the Pirates aren’t go-
ing to make the MLB playoffs, but at least
they can’t screw up securing a .500 for the
ﬁrst time since 1992, right? Right?

A111 want to see at this point is this team
win 82 games, and surely that isn’t too much
to ask for. I
