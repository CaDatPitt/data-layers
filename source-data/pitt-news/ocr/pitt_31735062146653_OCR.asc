Elections Again '

Once more a student election has been held‘, ind
once more has a small minority put its candidates-
into oﬂice. But still, what’s the difference?‘ Who
cares? To -be elected to an" oﬂice means little 01.’ noth-‘.
ing; oﬁicers have "little 01‘ nothing‘. to do but.‘ h&AV€
themselves elected. ' - ‘ "T ' ,

Students’ indifference to the ballot. is pardonable,
fojrone does not care to spend even a minute _mIrkinz_
a sheet when the result leads to practically: ncthinz.
If duties involved any work or led to any material
accomplishment, the moment spent‘ wouldbe justiﬁ‘e'd.'
As it is, student indifference is pardonable.‘

Froslg. Rules .
.“‘Did you see any dinks on the campus today?”
“ ,.es, one. The kid looked awful dum .’’‘l .
And so gradually the hayseed regulations of the
past begin to disappear from the Plti‘._c&_mpliB'. The
collegiate body of the University is finally‘. threaten-
ing to grow up. ' . . ‘
Harvard, a model of school spirit among America}:
universities, has no rules. The University of Chl-
cago, without regulations, stands out amongthe Big-
Ten for its spirit. The list could go on-~—thAe‘_ list of

bigger schools, of universities. Freshman’ ‘reg'ula- '

tions are being outgrown. The small colleges. still
cling to the dink and paddle, but the larger ,iAnstiAtu~
tions are dropping away from the dunce-cap‘ theory
of school spirit. ‘ - A
Once again,
‘Let’s grow up.’

 

The Smoke?‘

The annual cross—section view of activities, spen-

sored by Omicron Delta Kappa in the form of.‘:a.'“‘
smoker, will be held this year in December, rather '

than in the spring. Plans are already under way for

the affair, which is being held earlier this year. in
. order that freshmen may ‘know what activities are ‘all
about before the school season is practically over. The
move, we believe, is a wise one. Freshmen'intoreItcd
inactivities will also show wisdom by attending the
affair. ‘ __
j Many men‘ on thecampus today who have’ had in-
.terest in activities during their college life, date their
first step toward extra—curricular work,-:f1'_om_ the

 Freshman -Regulations

A few gems from the Pitt Weekly
might prove interesting:

“The 150 freshmen shouldered the
responsibility of assenting for their
class’ for the continuance of fresh
regulations.” -

‘Only an affirmative ' vote was
asked on the q*uestion.”

“Only 50 sophomores attended
their class meeting.”

“From more than 70‘ applicants, a
wrecking crew Qua: appointed.”

Question of a freshman: “Is it _im-
possible to have school- spirit with-
out regulations?” _ ’

No answer vzas*giv‘en.

Charles R. Foster, Jr._, John R.
Johnston, Howard Linn, Herbert
Dent & Col’: “The pushball contest
will arouse classvsplrit.” _

Latest reporgs: _;I‘hi;ee. broken ribs.

“The "interfraternit conference
moved to uphold fres men regula-
tions.” ’ _ _"

Found on the campus after d1l1--
gent and exhaustive search: Two‘
dinks.

at: all *

President of college sophs: “The
fresh’ are in favor of _-the. regula-
tions.-?’ .  . '

Of about 500. freshmen, less than
one-third atten£led*the class meeting.

‘This "present year out of about

Seeks Improvements
Sir:

The west side of our campus, es-
pecially between the‘, “Y” Hut and
the stadium is nothing more or less
than ‘a. dumping. ground for the
Dental and -Medical schools. It seems‘
that something should be done to
make the hillside a more respecta-
ble place, At present, it is the most
disgi’i“s'ting'sig‘ht i_n Oakland.

The ‘five fraternities west of the
campus ﬁnd. it necessary to utilize
the ‘overgrown muddy hillside to go
to and from classes. It seems only
fair that those students should be
entitled to a campus equal in beauty
to’ the main part. Out-of-town
friends have visited and asked
where the campus was. The writer
was forced to admit that the whole-
sale dumping around between the Y.
M. C. A. and‘ the stadium was the
west side of our campus. Year after
year» We look for improvements, but
all in va:ln._. Must we continue to
tramp the muddy hillside?

More ‘Fraternity Rushing

, Everyvyear the storm clouds of de-
ferred rushing gather‘ over the heads
of Pitt fraternities. After every
rushing season comment arises re-
gardingthe disadvantages and ‘inef-
ﬁciencies of the present rushing sys-
tem. A few weeks ago the growing
"comment made it necessary for In-
terfraternity council to recommend
to ‘its presidentgtliat he appoint a
committee ‘to iiivestigate rushing
regulations andeonditions at other
eastern colleges ,-and universities.
Anumber of largeschools enforce
‘deferred rushing‘ and probably an
‘equal number use -~ open cut—throat
methods. Gra-nted -that late ﬁrst

rushing. has its ood points, both are
outweighed byt e advantages of the
plan‘ now used ’at‘Pitt.

~ During the two weeks period at
the_~.‘begi.nning of the ﬁrst semester,
freshmen are seldom rushed to.the
extent that opportunities are _ not
given" them to consider qualities of-
fei-"ed’by— the fraternities. No group
wants a'man whordoes not truly feel
that he wants..th_em. A fraternity
does not try to fasten its pledge pin
on every coat lapel; it carefully

then decides.,. It is easy to refuse
’a"'"bid whenfyou do not favor the
fraternity offering and nearly‘ as
easy when you are mentally con-
vinced that you cannot pledge.

zfort to raisetheir scholastic stand-

sophs, the freshmen made the goal,
placing the‘ball squarely between
the posts thus adding- ﬁve points to
their score. The sides then changed
goals and the game was continued
with the ball on the 50-yard line.
The fresh again showed their su-
periority, pushing steadily down the
ﬁeld. When the ﬁnal whistle blew
the ball was on the sophomore’s
ﬁve-yard line and the score was
7-0

ger of non-athletic activities, was
much pleased with the-game, citing
it as “an excellent demonstration
of class spirit.” “The freshmen
showed up in large numbers,” he

said, “and deserved to go in and
win.” 7
-Morris Schwartz, college sopho-

more president, said that the turn-
out exceeded his expectations. “This
scrap gave me an opportunity to
know the men in the sophomore
class that are interested ~- in their
class,” he said. _

Herb Dent, chairman of the‘ soph

enforcement committee, was very
terse in his view of the game. “We
were good,” he admitted. “But not

good enough,” someone in the back
of the dressing room added.
Lindsay’s Opinion

“I believe that contest was the
best thing that could happen to
arouse the spirit of my class,” was
the opinion of James Lindsay, presi-
dent of the freshmen class. “Here-
after there will no doubt be a more
uniform observation of regulations,”
he continued.

Milton, Saﬁer, president of the
senior court, expressed the view. that
“the contest will not only raise the
spirit of both classes, but will raise
school spirit as well.”

The affair was brought to a close
with the freshmen waving their ties
above their heads, while newspaper
cameramen snapped photos of the
ragged, winded contestants.

Only about 25 co-eds appeared in
the stands. Nearly all were fresh-
men and cheered lustily for their
class. Of the faculty, W. Don Har-
rison, dean of men, John R. Johnson,
his assistant, and Dr. J. E. White,
of the psychology department,.at-
tended. .

 

PITT PLAYERS MAKE

the lot, as far as plays are con-
cerned. Fantine, dancer in the
Casino Garden, comes back to the
partner she deserted. They put on
an Apache Dance, and the partner
kills her. Gripping, what? The ac-

-tion all takes place off stage, and

is told to the audience by a five-
piece orchestra, who “watch the. af-
fair. ’ The play was as cheap a'melo-
drama, one-act, or three-act, that
this reviewer (who can still remem-
ber the blood and Thunder of Ari-
zona and plays like that)_ has ever
seen. Even a -typical Pitt Player’
audience saw through it and giggled.
Considerin what they had to deal
with," how er, the actors did quite
well. W. Frederick Elwood (Cornet)
and Karl ‘Swartzel (Saxophone)
were very good, and Herman Ma-
gram (Violin) and Harold Koch,
(Cornet) also came through. .We
may be wrong,‘ but it seemed to us
that Jimmy.Sloan tried" to get ‘on
much. out of his lines. The setting

one word-—-.-terrible.

Players director, deserves a lot of
credit for the castingand acting; as
in most‘ Pitt Player ,productions,
they were both good. Then too, one
must always keep in mind the terri-
ble handicap she labors under in the
matter of stage materials and lim-
ited‘ ~ﬁnancial resources.
who,» has I ever peeped back stage,
(and, incidentally, ‘has -almost gotten
his neck bitten ‘off for ’ doing it)
knows what. we mean. However,
we must disagree with Mrs“. Mac-
Queen in_ the-matter of plays chosen.
«In last week’s group, the only ‘Wor-
thy. p.roduct_ion by a collegiate or-
ganization’ was Wurzel-Flummery.
The'otl'1er two‘ were first rate for

I-second-rate high schools. Keeping

in mindwhat we have said about
handicaps, however, it ‘seems to us
that there are certain good plays
that might be put on successfully.

To insure discipline among stu-

at university functions, Bill Daufen-
bach came to Pitt two years ago as
assistant to the dean of men.

“I find the students very interest-
ing at all times,” says Dau-fenbach.
“If I think someoneis wastin his
time I givehim some advice, bu I’ve
never had any trouble with students.
They» always co-operate with me. If
they don't, I get after them. I don’t
fool or let them get away wi h any-

thinlg.  .

“There are less students loafing‘ in
the halls this year, too. They spend

the noise._in-the hall is decreasing.

dents conduct themselves rather

' Brilliant color combined ‘with
blackgis a favorite styling. for ‘the
fall and winter frocks. Sometimes
mere touches of color are V. used with
black, sometimes the two are used
in about even quantities. ‘ ' '

, In the pretty dress pictured 5 the
short bolero and the skirt are fash-

ioned of'black crepe de chine, while

the bodice is" of brocaded satin, in
of the same material. .

the ruffles may be just the thing to
help you utilize the smaller pieces
of fabric without the placing being:

And then, again, .the~fashion is
so pretty that you may decide that
for once you will" have a dress.
which you cannot’ conscientiously
make over, but may wear while ‘it
is fresh and then caste aside with-
out regret. ’ - ‘ '

Thestory is that of the daughter «of a mountain
preacher. The -.girl’s mother, dead for years, has left
Angel with a heritage of. ﬁner-sensibilities and ﬁrmer
faith in iherself than most of the mountain folk can
boast. Her father, sincere in his religious enthusi-
asm, has “informed” on her whiskey-making lover, so
thattshe ﬁnds herself alone with, the prospect of a
child: soon to arrive. Her father-’s only God-fearing
solution is to marry her oif to a" backwoodsman whose

home offersnothing but work, hardship and 'so‘litud'e_.‘
[Angel faces her problem of waiting for Buck,

the‘ lover, keeping herself from becoming -as the

hardened, bitter, snuff-rubbing women’ of the hills,.

typiﬁed by her neighbor, Mrs. ‘Kent. For ‘six years

she does the heavy‘ work of cultivating. the corn ﬁeld,-,
caring for the hdusefand small child.- and winning‘

out against the domineering stupidity of her husband.
With the coming of the -railroad to Beartown, Buck
returns with a prison gang. The gap of. years has

The game will be a

Since. the short rest following the
Wash-Jeff game, Dr. _Sutherland"‘has
been concentrating his work toward
preventing overconﬁdence to spread
out in ‘the Pitt ranks. Both teams
cannot boast of very successful sea:-'

State having dropped one n‘iVore. Pitt,j
however, came around to its .real

However, the "game Thursday is

its worth this year by holding for
downs in the shadow of the goal.
