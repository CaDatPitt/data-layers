 know if

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Pitt officials are confident that
"the professors they hire have the
necessary credentials to teach at
the university.

Two, university deans, who
between them have 43 years at
Pitt, said they have never heard
of a professor faking his creden-
tials in order to get a position.

Thomas Galvin, dean of the

. School of Library and Informa-

tion Science, said his school is

too small and well-defined for

applicants to fake information
on their job applications.

“To my knowledge, we've
never had anybody that present-
ed questionable credentials,
though I am sensitive to the
problems." he said. A

The question of professors’
credentials arose several weeks
ago after a man identified as Paul
A. Crafton was arrested for
teaching under assumed names
at two Pennsylvania colleges.

Crafton, who had been on the
staff of George Washington Uni-
versity for 27 years, had been
teaching under fake names at
Shippensburg State College and
Millersville State College. Craf-
ton had used the names John B.
Hext and Peter Hector Pearse,
respectively, at both schools.

After police arrested Crafton,
identification was found in his
hotel room that linked him with
at least 13 other aliases. Crafton
said he used the fake names in
order to obtain jobs to support
his daughter who is critically ill
with multiple sclerosis. ’

"Galvin said because his school
isso small, he can afford to be
confident about the professors
he hires. Although LIS does
advertise for job openings, most
of the applicants come from a

’ small, select group.

“We have a national scholarly
field of professors," he said.
“Most of our candidates come
through that route.”

He" said in the field of library
and information science, there
are about l,S00 to 2,000 people
who are competent enough to

- teach the subject, so the depart-
ment knows most of the people
involved in the field.

Crafton used several academic
credentials from foreign univer-
sities in Britain, Canada and
Australia to obtain positions.
Galvin said foreign credentials

John Doe Could Not Teach At Pitt

are not a problem at Pitt's
School of Library and Informa-
tion Science. ' _ _

“We have very few people
from foreign institutions apply-
ing at Pitt," Galvin said.
“Although this is hard to verify,
they are so rare in this particular
field.”

Calvin believed that the Craf-
ton situation could never happen
in hispdepartment, however, ‘he
admitted it could happen at Pitt.

“It can happen to any univer-

sity, in any field,” he said. “But, _ 

it's probably less of a chance ofit
happening in a small, well-
defined area like LIS."

John Murray, the dean of
Pitt's Law School agreed’ with
Galvin by saying that the Craf-

Semester:

At Sea

Beachedi

By BRIAN BALK

The students aboard the S.S. Uni- -4 
verse have experienced anything but P V. 
calm waters on their semester at sea ., A‘

this winter term.

The ship collided with a sandbar  I 
on Feb. 25 and was drydocked in ~ 

Jerusalem. On March 24, Tobias H.
Dunkelberger, the academic-dean of

Pitt's semester at sea program, died,

while in Israel. Andjust recently, the
students learned that the ship will be

unable to continue the voyage and-" ii

the semester will be curtailed.

While travelling outside of the
port of Alexandria, Egypt, stormy
weather caused the ship to strike a
sandbar. The ship was then towed,
without passengers, to Athens,
Greece, for repairs.

It was expected that the ship could . I: 

be repaired in a period of two or

three weeks. Extensive damages, .

however, made it impossible for the
ship to be repaired in time to com-
plete the voyage. I

“I still don’t know the extent of
the damages," John Tymitz, the

director of administrative affairs for I -I 

the Institute of Shipboard Educa-
tion, said. ,

Students To Attend D.C. Conference

By PAUL CORREA

Four Pitt students have been
selected to attend a conference at
which President Ronald Reagan is
expected to speak.

The four students, Linda O'Con-

_nor, Ron Barber, Beth Ingold and

Bernard Anderson, will be attending
the conference to be held at the
Washington Hyatt on April 8. Rea-
gan has been invited to deliver the
keynote address, “Shaping the Pre-

“The president's schedule is released
only the night before when he is in
Washington." This security precau-
tion was initiated after the assassina-
tion attempt on Reagan in 1981.

The conference is the 14th annual
student symposium sponsored by
the Center for the Study of the Pre-
sidency. The participants from Pitt
were nominated by the political
science department, the honors pro-
gram and the communication and
rhetoric department.

, faculty member from_the political

science department or the communi-
cation and rhetoric department
alternates each year, and this year, it
was his department's turn to go to

-the conference.

According to Windt, the students
are picked because of their interest
in politics.

‘‘It is an enriching political educa-
tion for these students," Windt said,
“lt's a confluence of academics and
politicians in Washington-~-not
solely academics and not solely poli-
ticians, but a mixture."

“I never heard of it happening
in an legal education institution
in the United States,” Murray
said.

Murray said the law and grad-
uate schools in the U.S. are so

‘could have a brief conversation
with a person, and I0 minutes
later know whether he was lying
about his credentials by making
a telephone call.

As far as hiring foreign profes-
sors, Murray said it’s rare for Pitt
to hire someone that has
obtained a law degree outside of
the United States.

“It’s rare for us to hire some-
one who doesn’t have a law
degree,” he said. “I can see it hap-

know all the law schools and the

When contacted, College of
Arts and Sciences dean Irwin

not in the office for comment.

The speakers will present a series

both the historical and contempor-
ary presidency, according to Windt.
The participants have been mailed a
study guide to prepare them for the
conference. After the panel discus-
sions, the participants will be
divided into small groups where they
can question the speakers. Windt
said, “The last time I went, I was

  

       

very impressed by the questions
asked by the students."

O’Connor said she became inter-
ested in the, conference after taking
Dr. Keefe’s “American Legislative
Process" class. She said the confer-
ence will allow her to ask a lot of
questions. “I have many questions as
a result of Dr. ’Keefe’s class that I

Frick Fine Arts:

By MARY ANN KRUPA

, There is a little bit of Renaissance
Italy in Oakland, and it belongs, like
so many of Pittsburgh’s treasures, to
the university. «

The Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts
building sits at the entrance to the
Junction Hollow Bridge as a lavish
memorial to Florentine Renaissance
perfection and to a man whose name
and fortune make up so much of
Pittsburgh’s history.

The two and a half story gray
limestone building was given to the

‘ university by Helen Clay Frick in the

early '60s as .a tribute to her father,
the powerful Pittsburgh Steel and

coke baron, and it reflects an atten- _

tion to superlativeidetail that only $5
million of Frick money can buy.

Designed by Kenneth B. John-

covers 57,000 square feet of floor
space built around the large, open-
air cloister in the Renaissance court-
yard tradition. The two story
cherry-paneled library contains over

30,000 volumes and is considered

one of the most notable art research
resources in the nation.

The cloister in the central part of‘

the building houses the Lochoff col-
lection of Italian Renaissance paint-
ings and frescoes, which are all
painstaking copies of the originals.
Nicholas Lochoff, the artist, was a

_ Russian commissioned to reproduce

these 22 works of art by Botticelli,
Bellini, Piero Della Francesca and
Fra Angelico. .

resemble the originals as closely as
possible, Lochoff spent up to 18
months on each of them, going to
extraordinary lengths to reproduce
the cracks and imperfections that
age would have revealed naturally.
He learned to paint the way the mas-
ters would have painted in the 14th
century, grinding his own pigments,
polishing the gold surfaces with an
agate and inventing tiny modeling
tools for intricate recessed work on
gold backgrounds.

In addition to the galleries,‘ class-
rooms, studios and 200-seat audito-
rium, a rotunda under the octagonal
cupola houses the 3,000-pipe organ
that originally sat in the F rick home
in Pride’s Crossing.

ing, her intention was to have it serve
as a Pittsburgh center where her
father’s $50 million art collection
could be ‘displayed and where the
Frick family organ, moved here at
an expense of $70,000, could be used
to entertain visitors as they strolled
through the gallery.

In 1967, however, the university
insisted on a free hand in running the
arts center, and Miss Frick cancelled
all the endowments she had
arranged to help pay for staff and
operating expenses. She removed all
of the treasured and valuable pieces
of her father's collection but left the
organ, since it was impossible to
remove. It had been built in.

and for a couple of years, the organ
sat mute and untouched as Pitt‘s
budget found no room for organ re-
citals after it was left with the cost of
running and building.

Today, the organ is operating
again, and two, recitals have been
arranged this spring by the music
department—one featuring Dr.
Robert Lord, a member of Pitt’s
music faculty, the man originally

ii selected by Frick to preside at the

organ’s console before the contro-
versy took place.

Frick has since built her own
museum to house some of her
father’s collection, and it stands
today in Point Breeze.

One interesting and little-known
fact about Pitt's Frick collection,
according to David Wilkins, direc-
tor of the art gallery, is that the
sculpture “The Annunciation" is
actuallly
purchased by Frick at great expense
for the cloister with the understand-
ing that it was a 14th century piece
by Simoni Martini; it is, however, a
20th century piece by the artist
Dossena.

    Truth Or
Consequences

4‘.

Only in Americaican John Doe grow up to
be more than president, he can impersonate
professors and teach at several‘colleges——-and
succeed. ‘

Paul A. Crafton has recently been arrested
'after being identified as the man who taught
under assumed identities at two Pennsylva-
nia colleges.

He was thought to have arranged his '
classes so that he taught at Millersville State
College on Monday, Wednesday and Friday ,
and at Shippensburg State College on Tues-
day and Thursday. It is also reported that his

V case has brought inquiries from several other '

colleges where he could have been a business
professor or mathematics professor. Interest V
in the case has risen, and the question pres-
ents itself. At a_ university the size and com-
plexity of Pitt, could a John Doe ever -
suddently appear to .. be. .cx.p0S¢d 35 311
impostor? '

Pitt administrators have said that the veri-
ﬁcation process, especially for foreign
faculty, is detailed. They deny that this could
ever happen at a university the size and qual-
ity of Pitt, but never is a long, long time.

The case is to be looked upon as a lesson
warning university administrators to be care-
ful when checking the people they hire or _
think they have hired. .

The case of “Professor X” and Crafton’
part in it only came to light a few weeks ago
when Shippensburg officials were made
aware of an article by John B. Hext, a profes-
sor at an Australian college. The only prob-
lem was that officials at the college thought
Hext was working at their campus teaching
mathematics and computer science. Crafton
used Hext’s credentials and presented himself ,
as Hext in order to gain employment. After ‘
this discovery, other reports led to his identi-

A fication and arrest. -

According to various administrators at the
colleges involved, the discovery was a rude
awakening—a real surprise. It is very reveal- _‘
ing that universities have grown so large that '
they do not know who really works for them ’
and who does not.

Fortunately, this is not an event that
affects Pitt, but the case does offer a warning _
to other schools. Pitt's verification process
may be difficult, but nothing is foolproof.

Exercise In Confusion

Dear Editor:

I do agree with John Houston
(“Bombs and Brotherly Love,”
March 21) that for the present, total
nuclear disarmament is unrealistic.
However, his solutions to the prob-
lem are an exercise in confusion.

His justification of nuclear arms
as a means to counter terrorism is
unfathomable. Most often, terror-
ism is an unfortunate and misguided
expression of anger and revolt of a
helpless race of people against
decades
oppression—the Palestinians are a
case in point. v ,

The solution to terrorism does not
lie in the expensive development of
sophisticated nuclear arms. Instead,
the superpowers need to make a con-
structive effort towards understand-
ing the roots of the problem and
muster up enough will to sincerely
come up with solutions while sacri-
ficing their own petty self-interests.

John's view that Soviet intransi-
gence is the major factor responsible
for the escalation of the arms race is
also debatable. Personal experience
has mercilessly impressed upon the
Soviets the horrors and misery of
war. It is probably true, therefore,
that like the American people, the
Soviets, too, share a commitment to
peace.

I think that long-standing mutual
mistrust between the Americans and
the Soviets is the primary reason for
the nuclear build-up. A positive way

His Own

Dear Editor:

ln a March 28 letter to The Pitt
News, Dana Reed and Tom Wanko
defended the Progressive Student
Network against Zachary Grayson's

T charges of anti-Semitism by stating,

“PSN will continue to criticize the
situation in the Middle East, as is
our right. And, as if Mr. Grayson's
right, he will continue to comment.
But we will also continue to take
offense at degrading, self-serving
and inaccurate labels which serve
nothing but the alienation of
people."

opinion against nuclear arms is of
unquestionable importance in the
quest for nuclear disarmament.

The United States boasts of a free
and open society and has always
symbolized the virtues of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. Hence,
it is only fitting that the American
people take the initiative in this
noble mission of world peace.

Advice

However, in a March 16 article
entitled “The Great Communica-
tor," Dana Reed referred to the
chancellor as “Grand Poobah" and
“Ole Wes."

This to me seems hypocritical. lf
Reed and Wanko don‘t like to be
called “degrading” and “self-
serving" names, then perhaps Reed
should stop calling other people
names which may lead to “aliena-
tion.” May I suggest that Reed make
a strong attempt to follow his own
advice.

‘The Illusion OfPo wer

9’

Dear Editor:

In the last few issues of rtiéilii‘ News, it
has come to my attention that there isa great
amount of space alloted to the subject of
nuclear weaponry and the possibility of dis-
armament. It seems the majority of people
are concerned with the possible holocaust
that would result from the use of these

~ weapons.

Perhaps they should take a critical look at
the potential threat that faces the U.S. 50
miles across the Bering Strait; then, after
examining the system in the U.S.S.R., they
should consider the very real consequences
of opening up any avenue that could lead to’
the possible demise of our system.

The issue is not what our actual strength
is, but rather, what the Soviet high com-
mand perceives as our actual strength. When
Hitler invaded Europe, he was not fully pre-
pared, and yet he succeeded because of the
perception the allied countries had of Ger-
many. When he opened up a second front in
the U.S.S.R., his own perception was
wrong, even though his army was prepared
(i.e., Hitler thought he could defeat the
Soviets, so he attacked).

When dealing with the leadership of the
Soviet Union, one must never forget that it is
now headed by the ex-chief of the KGB. The
KGB is the modern version of the NKVD of
WWII. If you are not aware of these two
interesting societies, 1 highly suggest some
serious research into the subject (be sure to
include their methods of operations). The

e%x‘pe,rwti“se_uof this ‘group lies in its ability to
capitalize on its opponents’ weaknesses. The

calls for disarmament in our country can -

only bring joy to their hearts. Revolution
can only be started by internal dissent. This
is the basis of all Communist doctrine.
Perhaps disarming would be a good idea
to consider; of course, immediate attack of
our homeland might just follow such an

. event. If- we continue» escalating the arms
‘ race, more‘and more of the populace will
. jobject. Include a draft, and the U.S.S.R. has
won half the battle already. Dissention will‘

reign, and -then we will be vulnerable. The
economy is bad, and people are seeking solu-
tions to their problems. The time is ripe for

war.

There are many ways to wear down an
opponent before crushing him. Andropov
could probably write a very decent book on
the subject. Do not think for one moment
that if this man sees a chance to defeat us, he
will ignore it.

Wars are fought over ideologies and
started because of vulnerabilities. Serious
thought should be given to our nation's
weaknesses rather than our strength. If we
are going to survive this century, it’s*impera-

_tive that we create the illusion of power,

regardless of cost. This may be a way to
ensurepeace; otherwise, this country may
have to use the weapons which already exist.

The following information has been
excerpted from an ACLU handbook.
"The Rights of Physically Handicapped
People, " by Kent Hull. .

Q: Who is considered handicapped
within the meaning of the Rehabilitation

A: The definition remains controversial.
The-act provides a deﬁnition which has
. three criteria, any one of which may
. result in an individual being considered
handicapped under 5~§504. ~.A “handi-
capped person” withinthe meaning of the
act is any person.who:

0 has a physical or mental impairment
which substantially limits one or more
major life activities (such as caring for
one’s self, performing manual tasks,
working, seeing, hearing, learning etc.)

0 has a record of such an impairment.

0 is regarded as having such an
impairment. .

Q: Are services and programs other than
traditional classroom education to be
provided to handicapped children? _
V A: Yes,'according to the Education for
All Handicapped Children Act of I975.
Handicapped children must have availa-
ble to them “the variety of educational
programs and services available to non-
handicapped children inthe area served.
by” local public agencies such as art,
music, industrial arts, vocational and

Rights Of Handicapped

Act of 1973§5o4? ~ ,

homemaking education etc.

In addition, steps must be taken to
provide nonacademic and extracurricu-
lar services and activities such as athlet-
ics, transportation,‘ counseling services,
recreational activities etc. -

Physical education must also be pro-

vided unless a child is enrolled full time in
a separate facility or the child's needs are
such that special physical education is
appropriate. ' I
Q: When considering a handicapped .
individual, for an employment position.
what steps must co__ntractors take
under §503 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973? .
A: The regulations provide that contrac-
tors must review their personnel practices
andiprocedures to assure careful and sys-
tematic consideration of the job qualifi-
cations of the handicapped applicant.
This section is designed to prevent the
traditional stereotyping of handicapped
applicants without considering their abil-
ity to perform the jobs in question.

In determining the physical and mental
qualifications of , handicapped appli-
cants, contractors must review their
requirements to ensure that, to the extent
qualification requirements tend to screen
out qualified handicapped individuals,
they are job related and are consistent
with business necessity and safe perfor-
mance of the job. ’ I

  SGB Fighting Internship Office Closing

oCommon Sense

' or that internships in their field even exist.

Dear Editor:

In the article appearing in the March 23
edition of the Pitt News concerning the SGB
fight over the Internship Office, three alter-.
natives were cited as possible solutions if the
office were to close, all of which were unac-
ceptable to the SGB for reasons listed by
Mark Downs, president of the SGB.

I must comment on the alternative which
refers to the coordination of internships to
each department, and on the reasons for
rejecting it.

Mr. Downs states that this solution is
unacceptable since “the Internship Office is
centrally located——without a centralized
location students may not know where to go

I feel that Mr. Downs would benefit by
asking an appropriate sample of Pitt stu-
dents where their departmental office is, and
then ask the same student where the Intern-
ship Office is located. I believe that common
sense will dictate that/almost all students can
pinpoint where their departmental office is,
but few know exactly where the Internship
Office is.

The second point Mr. Downs questions
can also be argued. A paragraph in the pam-
phlets distributed by the departments and a
listing in the course description under each
department would alleviate the ignorance
factor.

Granted that the demise of the Internship
Office would be a loss, but why hasn't SGB
fought other academic battles, such as the
geography department closing or the
wretched all-night waits that computer
science majors must face to ensure that they
receive the courses they need to graduate?

The loss of the office is not insurmounta-
ble, and with some cooperation from each of
the CAS departments, I am quite sure. an
equitible solution can be worked out.

Cutting Morale

Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my support for the
Student Government Board’s efforts to pre-
vent the closing of the Internship Office here
at Pitt. No one can deny that it is necessary
for this university to reduce expenditures in
this era of fiscal shortfall. We might ques-
tion, however, the one-dimensional
decision-making criteria the adminstration

-».........~...a—a.a-no--—.q..,

seems to be using in its efforts at “cutback
management.”

It seems sensible and prudent that the uni-
versity would try to achieve two things when
making decisions on cutbacks: saving
money and retaining the integrityand qual-
ity of the university. From recent events, it
seems clear that “the balance sheet" has
gained ascendency over more qualitative
goals.

The planned closing of the internship
office is a case in point. When compared to
the overall budget of this university, the
$20,000 that it takes to run this office seems
infinitesimally small. Yet the importance of
such a service cannot be underestimated. As
many a person with an ‘undergraduate
degree knows, internship experience can
make the difference between finding an
interesting job in one‘s chosen field and
slinging hamburgers at the local fast-food
joint for starvation wages. The planned clos-
ing of the internship office demonstrates an
extreme insensitivity to student needs.

My decision tocome to Pitt was made at
least in part in an effort to avoid the kind of
thing to which we seem to be in danger of
succumbing here at the present time—the
demoralization of the entire university by
thoughtless hacking and chopping of
budgets. Washington State, where I
obtained my undergraduate degree, has

experienced tremendous shortfalls due both ,

to economic conditions and to the archaic
and regressive revenue systems that finance
state programs.

Both the university I attended and the
University of Washington reacted to the
need for cutbacks, not by developing
rational criteria for budget cutting that
could differentiate between “the fat and the
bone," but by attacking those programs
which had weak constituent support (i.e.,
programs that served primarily students)
and by cutting out any innovative or pro-
gressive programs that often were primary
contributors to the school's reputation and
academic environment.

, The chaos created at the University of
Washington by such a pattern of cuts heavily
influenced my decision to come to Pitt for
graduate study.

My strongly-held belief is that high-level
administrators oftenlack sensitivity-orcrea-
tivity when it comes to making admittedly
hard decisions about budget cuts. It is often
overlooked that not all decisions need to be
framed in all-or-nothing terms. For’exam-
ple, if $20,000 for the Internship Office can-
not be found within Pitt’s multimillion
dollar budget (which I seriously doubt), why
couldn’t the office be staffed by a part-time,

rather than a full-time employee? If such

programs are cut completely, in many cases,
they are gone forever. '

Before any more wildhackingis contem-
plated, I suggest that the university seek to
put its own house in order. I question how
efficient some of the administrative
branches of this university are. .

How much money could be saved in staff
time at the financial aid office if that office
did not routinely lose students’applications
or methodically put the Pennsylvania code
number on out-of-state financial aid appli-
cations? . _

How much staff time could be saved by
having an efficient on-line computer system
with relevant information on enrollment
and financial aid status, etc., of each student
instead of students having to run from office
to office tryi-ng to gain information that
should exist in each of the relevant offices?

Having seen firsthand the cumulative
effects of insensitive budget cutting, I sug-
-gest that the administration seriously under-
estimates the potential for the erosion of the
morale of faculty, students and stall as a
cumulative effect of authoritarian, insensi-
tive budget cuts. '

Dear Editor:

Along with the elimination of the geo-
graphy department and the reductions in the
Advising Center, the students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh are now being faced with
the elimination of the Internship Office. The
purpose of the Internship Office is to match
students with internship programs of their
choice, providing an exciting opportunity
for students to earn credits in an outside—of-
the-classroom experience. .

Started as a co-op program by a grant
from the Federal Government, the Intern-
ship Office has comeunder budget cuts

repeatedly in the past few years. Now it is
scheduled for termination sometime in June.

In these modern times, budget cuts are a
way of life. The Internship Office, though,
required only a very modest $20,000 per year

to operate,land this year, it has pulled in v

$40,515 tuition dollars for the University.
But who gains from the Internship Office?“
You, the students.

The internship program offered is like
none other available to undergraduate stu-
dents. In the past, students have used the
office to find Fall, Winter and Summer term
work opportunities in Washington, D.C.,
Pittsburgh and everywhere in between. This
year alone, the Internship Office aided 200
students in selecting the programs that best
fit their needs and desires, not to mention the
countless other students who used the
Internship Office as a starting point in their
internship hunts.‘ i

In assessing the worth of the Internship
Office, we must not deride the number of
students served but rather concentrate on
the long run benefit of the service provided

to these students by such a practical non-3

classroom experience. ‘ _

To the administration, we ask——Where
are interested students to turn when the cen-
tralized design of the Internship. Office is
eliminated? The essential fact in this issue is
that the students need a centralized office in

which they can investigate all possible .

internship avenues.
The opportunity to earn credits and gain
experience through this unique program will

perish in June unless the students voice their‘

concerns to the proper authorities in the
administration.

We invite all students who have enjoyed
the internship experience to help us keep the
Internship Office open. You can do this by
writing to Dr. Robert Gallagher, Director of
Counseling, 333 Schenley Hall, Pittsburgh,
PA 15260.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. ~ The measles outbreak that infected I8] stu-
dents at the University of Indiana earlier this month appears to be over.

The schools’ health service has administered about 23,000 measles vacci-
nations since the outbreak started, and students returning from spring break
last week had to prove they either had the disease or were immunized against
it before they were permitted to return to school.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-——Howard University’s student paper The Hilltop, ‘
has stopped publication because of financial problems.

The Hilltop came into the limelight recently when its editor, Janice
McKnight, was expelled because of alleged admissions violations.
McKnight was running stories that said the university council was discrimi-
nating against employees. The school’s president asked her to stop, and when
she did not, McKnight was expelled for allegedly lying on her application. A
Supreme Court ordered that the university reinstate McKnight.

The financial problems surfaced last week when the newspaper was unable
to pay staff salaries. The paper’s policy board, a 26-member group of faculty
and staff, voted to suspend publication until an audit can be conducted.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — Resident assistants and other dorm officials are
trying to find ways to enable homosexual and heterosexual residents to live
in peace in the same housing facility. I

The University of Kentucky’s Board of Trustees recently adopted a new
sexual harassment policy, but it does not include homosexuals. A spokes-
man for UK’s resident assistants said RAs are not trained in areas such as

A dealing with homosexuality.

A UK student filed charges of harassment against several fellow students
after his dorm room was vandalized and obscenities were written on his
door. The student is an alleged homosexual.

  Nationality Scholarships

continued from page eight

Endowed awards have steadily
increased, and this year the program
awarded four separate Italian Room
Committee scholarships. As people
retire or die, their friends and rela-
tives may decide tohonor them by
beginning a scholarship in their
name. Bruhns explained that "one
Yugoslavian couple, Mr. and Mrs.
Miles Rukavina, have a scholarship
named after them because their fam-
ily decided it would be a beautiful
way to show appreciation on their
60th wedding anniversary.

The Pitt News, Wednesday_ March 30,_l983g

Since its beginning, nearly
$300,000 has been raised for scholar-
ships, and the total number of stu-
dents who have won them has
reached 300.

The first scholarships were
awarded to Helen Rool Rush, Pitt
dean of women, and to Quo Vadis
hostess Margaret Kostelnik.

“It's true that about one-third of
the awardees have been men,"
Bruhns said, “but we don’t discrimi-
nate.” She added thatthere are no
constraints on. students—all full-

time students with a minimum
Q.P.A. are eligible to apply.

Although this was a record year
for scholarship recipients, Bruhns
said the actual number of apppli-
cants was slightly lower this year.
She later attributed this to the eco-
nomic situation because students
might have to work a summer job
instead of travelling abroad.

“I would like to see more students
become aware of the scholarships
and prepare themselves to apply
earlier—for instance, in their sopho-

more year,” Bruhns said. More stu-
dents are being made aware of study
abroad opportunities by word of
mouth, she said, but there is still
room for improvement.

“One nice development has been _

through the honors program,“ she
explained. “Since Bob Pape [an
honors student graduate] received a
scholarship, they have been making
other students aware ofthe program
and the availability of scholarships.”

Students of all disciplines, notjust
language study, can benefit from
study abroad, according to Bruhns.

--Page 9

Awarded To Students

The Nationality Rooms and inter-
cultural program give nationality
rooms committees a focus and an
on-going task of introducing stu-
dents to opportunities and study in
their cultural and academic systems,
according to Bruhns. .

“Students benefit because they are
able to live independently, and no
one returns [from his travels] with-
out having gained an additional
independence and sense of tolerance
and a different perspective of their
status as an American,” Bruhns
explained.

 Making Beautiful

Music Together

L Mir

By Wes Cotter. D.J. Case and Diane Lefkowitz

e Heinz Chapel Choir during France tour of 1980.

 ' “fhéipiiitirliews, Wednesday March 30, 1933

and Jasper Johns do
for art.’

 

With only one music major
out of hundreds of members, the
Pitt band is a group whose cadre
consists of students who are
there to make music and have
fun.

There are 255 to 265 students
who participate in one or more
of Pitt’s four bands: the 235-
member marching band, which
performs at football games, pep
rallies and Homecoming activi-
ties; in the winter, the 55-
member concert band and the

'52-member basketball pep‘
, band; or the 22-member jazz-

rock band that plays at high
schools for recruiting purposes.

‘Approximately 75 to 100
incoming freshmen join the band
every year, according to Band
Director Donald Hower. These
figures seem to rise and fall,
though, with the success of the
football team.

.“We had a very large.fresh-
man class last year, and I think
you can relate it to the fact that
there was a lot of interest in the
football team.” he said.

..

“lt’s very expensive to try and

move, feed and house 235 peo-
ple,” he said, “and the cost
keeps going up every year.”
‘ Another big chunk of their
budget goes to band camp,
which is held on the Pitt Johns-
town campus six days prior to
the start of the fall term.

At band camp, members
practice their marching and
playing, and they learn the pre-
game and half-time shows for
the first two football games.

“We keep a pretty hectic
schedule at camp,” Hower said.
“We go from 9 o’clock in the
morning for rehearsals until 10
o’clock at night [in three inter-
vals]. When the football team
talks about three practices a
day, we do the same.”

Practices during the fall are
scheduled for two hours on
three evenings a week and on
Saturday mornings before foot-
ball games.

Hower finds that this rigid
schedule does inﬂuence the’
grades of some students, but

e '1 oto

This band member relaxes after a game by reading The

Pitt News.

‘‘I’m not anticipating that large
a class this year, because great
things aren’t expected [with the
football team] as they were last
year,” said Hower, who plans to
concentrate on quality rather
than quantity.

“What we’re looking for is to
attract some very good players
from a broad spectrum of stu-
dents whoicome to Pitt,” he said.

The band, which has been
playing since 1911, always trav-
els to Bowl games with the foot-
ball team, which is a nice
end-of-the-season reward.

However, it attends only two
away football games a year
because of the expense.

With an annual budget of
$125,000-$150,000, Hower said
that, 70 percent of that is used for
the three away trips. ’

this is not a common occurrence
within the band.

“I think the students have
found that in many cases, they
do better in their academic work
during the fall term,” he said.
“They know they have to budget
their time because the band
does take time. -

“As far as academic difficul-
ties go, there is a certain percen-
tage that does have difficulty
during the fall term, but I think
it’s a very low percentage,” he
said.

The busy schedule doesn’t
bother band member Allen Bas-
tecki, a freshman bass player
who said that being in the band
hasn’t had an adverse affect on
his grades at all, and that his
social life has improved.

“Band camp [especially]
helped me meet people,” Bas-
tecki said.

“I think the band has a lot of
pride,” he said. “When we're out
on that field, we’re not just to be
there and have a good time but
to show people that not only the
football team and sports are
good, but there are other
aspects of the university that at
good as well.” -

Hower agrees that pride has a
lot to do with the harmony of the
Pitt band. Although they have
day-to-day troubles, he said,

The Glee Club, one of Pitt’s old-
est organizations, is making a come-
back from a near fatal period _of
non-interest.

Many people seem to think that
the Glee Club is a thing of the past
that either folded or simply faded
away. But the opposite is true.

‘The Club has plans
for the future that
will pump some new
blood into its ac-
tivities.’

The club,'an all-male singing

I group, is currently on the upswing

due to the efforts of new director
John Yankee and club president
Paul Lazorcak. In recent years, the

club has seen a decline in both qual-
ity and recognition, however, the
club has plans for the future that will
pump some new blood into its
activities. '

problems. ‘

' “As far as monumental kinds
of problems, I’d say we really
haven’t had those,” he said.
“The students in the band have a_
great amount of pride for what ~
they do, and they understand
what they have to do to get the
job done. You put personalities

_ and all that stuff aside to do it.” D

Singing just for the fun of it may
soon be heard all over the campus.
Impromptu performances at the
Cathedral of Learning, Forbes
Quad and David Lawrence Hall may
become commonplace in the near
future.

According to Yankee, “It's defi-
nitely fun. If you like to sing, you’ll
enjoy this.” He added that the songs
they sing are familiar college-type
tunes.

Yankee is a doctorate student
from Princeton,»where one of the
most famous glee clubs, the Whif-
fenpoofs, is headquartered. Yankee
hopes to model the Pitt Glee Club's
activities, if not the Club itself, after
the‘ Whiffenpoofs. —

Yankee would not give the exact
size of the Glee Club but did stress
that the club is relatively small as to
allow for greater flexibility and
impulse.

'l he new and improved Glee Club
has a wide range of activities and
sings everything from “gospel to fun
little tunes,” Yankees said.

“We try to be flexible and mobile
to fit almost any situation: we can

' Singing “Happy Birthday to You"

in a bar last week is an example of _

the not-so-stuffy things the club
does just for fun. But the club also
does serious work such as perform-
ing at the alumni dinner, which it will
do next Friday. '

for 93 years and is, according to

Yankee, rarely paid for performing. ’ ‘

To join the Glee‘ Club, a person .

doesn’t have to be a musician or
have musical training, Yankee said,
however, many of the people in the
group do. '

“We look , for people who wel-
come a little exposure and who like
to perform,” Yankee said. “He also
added that members usually have
some elements of leadership and

, gain experience by being in the
group. For some members, this
experience includes not only per— a

forming but also public relations,
advertising and management.

The name “Glee Club" has many
connotations. Yankee said that peo-
ple should overlook this title. He
explained that in other schools
where these clubs are more popu-
lar, people don’t make as much fun
of the name. '

In spite of the name, the number
of people in the group is steadily
climbing. “They all came because
they like to sing,” Yankee said. “We

are building a group identity; we

want people from different groups,
and we accommodate them when
they come into the group.”

The Glee Club is a one-credit
course that practices for some-
where between two-and-one-half
and five hours a week. Yankee

Lackluster PanthersAced By |UP,8-1  

By TIM DINGER

‘‘It was the most disappointing
match I’ve ever had as a player or a

.@.,_coach at the University of Pitts-

burgh," tennis coach George Dief-
fenbach said after his 8-] loss to
Indiana University of Pennsylvania
yesterday at the Trees Hall courts.

“The team played with tightness,
low intensity and weak strokes, with
the exception of Jamie McDonald.
He played as well as any player can
play.”

McDonald become the lone

Panther victor after he came back -‘

from a 6-7 first set deficit, to beat
lUP’s Bill Appelt 6-7, 6-3 6-0.

“Jamie has been having a great
season,” Dieffenback said. “He had
an outstanding match after a hard
start. He made the right strategic

‘adjustments. He ~wanted the win
more than the other guy."

Pitt tasted defeat early, losing five
of six singles matches to clinch the
win for IUP before the doubles
matches even started.

“[ Dave] Kortyna and [Jack] War-
wick were the only other two players
to show any intensity, \but their
intensity wasn’t enough to win their
matches,” Dieffenbach said. “We
didn’t play (smart; we didn’t play
aggressively, and we didn’t use our
heads.

“It is very uncharacteristic for this
team to compete like that—and a
great letdown. I’m sure that we will

-.5-~see a drastic improvement in our

.0

performance the rest of the season."

In the No.2 singles match, lUP’s
Dave Zamperini, beat Panther D.J.
Mariano 6-3, 6-4.

In the No. 3 singles match, Pitt

junior Larry Lederer dropped to

Indiana’s Tony Cinelli 6-3, 6-3.
Senior Jack Warwick gave up a
close one to Indiana’s Tom Majesky

Pitt Survives Florida Tour;F3ces Geneva

Panther Pitcher Bob Myers

6-4, 7-6 at the No. 4 spot.

Sophomore Dave Kortyna took
the first set away from IUP's Tony
Medvetz but ended up losing the last
two, dropping the match 4-6, 6-4,
6-3. .

And finishing up the Panther sin-
gles, junior Jay Petras of Pitt fell to
Indiana’s Dave Snyder, 6-3, 6-0.

The doubles only rubbed salt in
the wounds, as IUP went 3-0 to end
the day with eight of nine victories.

In No. l doubles spot, McDonald
and Mariano teamed up against
lUP’s Appelt and Cinelli. Appelt
and Cinelli easily took the first set
6-3, but McDonald and Mariano
fought back in the second set to win
5-7. The third set went back and
forth until IUP pulled out the 6-4
thi_rd set victory for the match.

At the No. 2 doubles spot, Lederer
and Warwick combined for Pitt only
to fall to Indiana’s Zamperini and
Majesky 6-3, 7-5. ‘

Closing out the tennis action
under the lights were Panthers Kor-

tyna and Petras, losing to lUP’s.

Medretziand Snyder 6-4, 7-5.

“The only way that we were better
than they were is in the warmups.”
Dieffenback said. “Every one of our
guys was wearing matching blue and
gold sweats. Every one of them had
on a different uniform. The team
was an absolute zero in organiza-
tion. I give no credit to my opponent
because the way we played, all they
had to do was hit the ball over the
net. ‘

“From now until the season is
over, we will work, work and do

_ more work until we see some posi-

tive change in attitude.

“If this keeps up, we’re going to
have a long season.”

The Panthers will prepare for
tomorrow’s trip to Robert Morris
College for a 3:30 p.m. match

Jamie McDonald was the only Pitt winner as IUP smashed the Panthers, 8-1.‘

By scon DELLETT

Unlike last year, the Pitt baseball
team survived its recent trip to Flor-
ida with minimal damage. In fact,
the Panthers were rather competi-
tive despite the fact that the teams
they faced were in the middle of their
seasons.

Even though Pitt was swept by
Florida State this past weekend,
Coach Bobby Lewis saw some posi-
tive things come from theweek-long
trip.

“The trip really benefited the
team,” he said. “They're looking at
good pitching and thus they improve
as hitters. Good competition makes
you a better team. I saw a lot of good
things despite losing games."

The return of Aaron Krause will
aid the success of the Panthers in
1983. The sophomore righthander
threw a good game, according to
Lewis, despite his being the losing
pitcher in the first game 7-4.

“We're in the second game, too,
despite Bob Myers’ giving up six
runs in the first inning," Lewis said.
“But Florida State has a very good
club. They're ranked eighth in the
nation and have won I2 games in a
row."

lt also helps, ofcourse, to be in the
thick of a season rather than at the
beginning.

“They have the advantage of hav-
ing played 30 games," Lewis said.
“Florida State has consistency in
pitching and hitting. Their batters
have had over I00 at-bats, and their
starters have pitched in five to six

A ._ games so far.“

What impressed ‘Lewis and the

I 11-

f

K (

team the most, though, were the

facilities at Tallahasse. According to
the Lewis, the Seminole stadium is
in major-league class, along with the
program.

“They have impressive facilities,”
he said. “They have a new ballpark
which is big league, and they really
support the team; the ballpark is
filled.” - A

A nearly-lost tradition in baseball
is jockeying——getting on the opposi-
tion. Pitt had to face a well-arranged
group in the Florida State fans.

“They are great raggers,” Lewis
said. “The fans do cheers in unison,
and the students come out and really
support their team. lt’s nice to see

Rialphotor

yr

past years was the ability to practice
outdoors. With the abnormally
good weather in early March, the
team was able to practice outdoors
before its tour for Florida.

“It helped us to be able to practice
on a field instead of a gym floor,”
Lewis said. “Baseball was meant to
be played outside.”

Lewis agreed that the "team is
more ready for the season this year

v compared to the previous season.

“I think we’re better off,” he said.
“We have more depth than we did
going into the season last year.

“Everyone played in Florida, and
we were able to make decisions
down there rather than at the begin-

such interest in college baseball.” 3 ﬂing 0f thc regular season”

lt’a also good to see the Panthers
coming out of»Florida with a couple
wins in the record column. Accord-
ing to Lewis, the team for the most
part was hitting well.

“We had 10 hits in the first two
games," he said, “but we didn’t get
the timely hits. ln one games, we had
the lead-off batter on base three
times, but we ended up hitting into
three double plays.”

But Pitt batters had problems
making contact with the ball.

“We have to eliminate the strike-
outs,” Lewis said, noting that in one
game, Pitt batters fanned l2 times.
“We have to put the ball in play.

“I hope that this problem was due
to the Florida State pitchers’ being
way ahead of us." '

Another area ofconcern for Lewis
was the cutoff and relay plays. “We
had to make adjustments," he said,
“but the guys realize what they are
doing." ‘

One‘ break the Panthers had in

And the season starts tomorrow.
The Panthers take on Geneva in a
double-header at Trees Field,
weather and conditions permitting.

“Geneva was in the district
playoffs last year, and they were a
good club towards the end of the
season," Lewis said. “-It's good to
have better competition nearby.
You can't be on the road all the’
time.” A ,

PITT NOTES: Two familiar names

were on the ‘Florida State roster.’

Mike Yastrzemski is the starting
centerﬁelder for the Seminoles, and
Bruce Tanner had a save in the first
game against Pitt. Yastrzemski is the
son of Best Red Sox great Carl Yast-
rzemski. Bruce is the offspring of
Pirate manager Chuck Tanner

By CHARLlE O'HARA

Since completing the indoor sea-
son, the Panther track team has had
almost three weeks to prepare for
the outdoor season opener this Sat-
urday at the Colonial Relays in Wil-
liamsburg, Va.

As the team prepares for the new
season, head coach John Vasvary
has several objectives in mind.

“The basic idea for the outdoor
season is the same as the indoor," he
said. “We are seeking improvement
every week. There are a cou le of

differences between the two seasons,
though. For one, we know our guys
quite well.

“At the start of the indoor season,
we were new to them, and they were
new to us. After a season of breaking
them into the new system, they now
know what is expected of them, and
we know what we can expect of
them.

“The basic team goals are to do
well in the conference meet and
make some good showings at many
of the prestigious relay meets,” he
continued. “You try not to make

specific goals because if you reach
them too early in the season, which
several of the team members are ca-
pable of doing, then you get stuck
with nothing to shoot for."

There is an additional considera-
tion for the. outdoor season that

-didn’t exist during the indoor sea-

son. Several key members will be
participating in spring football
drills. NCAA-qualifying hurdler
and Big East high jump runner-up
Roger Kingdom, Big East shot put
champ Bob Buczkowski and
sprinter-long jumper Joe McCall
will be absent from competition
until they finish spring drills.

The loss of these three will hurt
the depth of the team.

There will also be several other
changes the team must endure. The
outdoor list of events is longer and
more difficult to fill. The Panthers
will need some help if they plan to
compete in the throwing events. The
hammer throw, the javelin and the
discus will demand support that the
Panthers do not have, especially
with the loss of Buczkowksi for most
of the season.

The steeplechase and the 400-
meter intermediate hurdles are also
events that don’t exist in indoor
track. In these events, however, the
Panthers do appear to have some
capable people. Pat Moran has been

Napoli Pizzeria
3606 Fifth Ave., Oakland

By THE WORKING STIFF

Some Italian restaurants, deep down,
are as Italian as apple pie.

Napoli Pizzeria in Oakland is true green,
white and red - the colors of the Italian flag
- from wall panels to the globes on the light
fixtures to the mesh pans on the wall that
illustrate the sizes of pizza.

The travel posters extol the Calabria
region outside Naples. Behind the counter
hangs a poster of the 1982 World Cup
championship soccer team. A stack of fly-
ers advertises a bake sale by the Pitt Italian
Club. And presiding over it all is Napoli’s
trademark, the statue of the rotund chef
with a mustache, pizza pan outstretched to
advertise “the real Italian touch.”

Napoli's tomato sauce had a low quo-
tient of common Italian spices, but few
restaurants go to such lengths to advertise
their Italian roots.

And no one serves bigger pizza cuts. I
ordered my customary half-hoagle and
two cuts of pizza, but had to leave part of it
behind.

The pizza cuts are 75 cents each, a price
that should have tipped me to their size:
roughly eight inches wide, 10 or 12 inches
long and about Va-lneh thick. The doughy
consistency and the cheesy flavor are dif-
fetelstfroin most Pittsburgh plazas-andl
callhnite pinpoint what makes Napoll’s
spacihl. Call It a subject for future reseaeh.

 oven-baked hoagie was delicious,

' #110335: like the pizza it wasn't spicy

to suit an. The hoagie had a fresh
spout! Ilhthsll, mild tomato sauce and

t , Is!/ledfsnozarella running down the sides

at the bread. The sauce even had a fugitive
mushroom in it, matching the onion that
somehow found its way into the pizza.
Both were welcome additions.

Pitt students and hospital staff are
apparently the main clientele at Napoli's.
On a rainy afternoon all 11 tables were
occupied, several of them by customers
waiting near the counter for their orders.

They can choose among the standard
varieties fo hoagles: Italian, meatball,
sausage, caplcola. salami (all $3.20 for a
whole and_Sl.70 for half) and provolone
and ham and cheese (33 for a whole and
Sl.Q9»for a ham. '

lug with plain ones at $3.20 for a whole and
$1.70 for a half. Cheese is $3.60 and $1.90;

New Investigation...

The University of Kansas‘
athletic programs have run into
rough times within the last year. In
addition to the stripping of a foot-
ball player of a year's eligibility and
‘the ﬁringiof two coaches, Kansas
received 6'ffI'cial notice from the

.NCAA that the organization is

again looking into charges ofalleged
recruiting violations. N

The university refused to discuss
the matter, but it may involve the
recruiting of two football players
last year.

The Pittﬂews. Wednesday March 30, I983

Within the last I2 months, both
Jayhawk football and basketball
coaches, Don Fambrough and Ted
Owens, have been fired and tailback
Kelvin Bell was docked a year’s eligi-
bility after he was found academi-
cally ineligible in I980, the year in
which he set the Big Eight freshman
rushing record.

Also, the Kansas City Star
reported in July that two prospects
said they had been offered up to
$30,000 by former assistant coach
John Hadl. Hadl, who left Kansas in
1981, denied the allegations.

Going West...

Iowa basketball coach Lute
Olsen has decided the Southwest is
more to his liking; he recently
accepted the head coaching job at
the University of Arizona.

Olsen compiled a I67-9| record in
nine years at Iowa, making him the
winningest coach in the school’s his-
tory. This year, the Hawkeyes fin-
ished 2l-l0, concluding with a 54-53
loss this past Fridav to Villanova in

the NCAA Midwest semi-finals at
Kansas City.

The reason for the decision,
according to Iowa athletic director
Bump Elliott, was because Olsen
and his family prefer to live in the
West.

Olsen replaces Ben Lindsey, who
was fired after his first season, in
which the Wildcatscompiled a 4-24
record—l-l7 in the Pacific I0
Conference——the worst record in the
school's history.

Another Game?.... «- ‘

Remember the big fuss over Ken-
tucky’s playing Lousiville, two
schools only 60 miles apart? It took
the NCAA Championships to get
both together, but it may not be the
same in the future.

A regular season meeting between
the two could take place if both Ken-
tucky and Louisville can follow
through with a meeting next month.
Both universitys‘ board chairmen

would like to have a game to raisg

money for both schools.

Louisville defeated Kentucky 80-
68 in overtime for the Mideast
Regional Final last Saturday in
Knoxville. The two teams had not
met since I959 before this game.

Spring News....

Defensive tackle Tom Johnson
will miss most of Pitt’s football
spring drills. The junior from Penn
Hills suffered cartilage damage in
his knee. Johnson missed all of last
season due to academic problems
after starting two games in I98l."“-«

Junior wide receiver Jeff Casper,
with problems in his lower back, will
also miss spring practice.

“Pat has hurdled before,"Vasvary
said. “He is a good athlete. I’m confi-

The intermediate hurdling corps
looks impressive, too. Brian Pollock
is as capable as anyone in the c‘onfer- ~
ence. Mario Joyner will also impress
people, just as he did in the open
400-meters run at the Big East

but they should be quite competitive -' -’
in the relays, especially in the mile,
two-mile and shuttle hurdle.

Following this week’s opener, the
Panthers travel to the Dogwood
relays; they then have a break for
finals. Vasvary is still looking for a
meet the weekend of April 23. On
April 30, the team travels to the
Penn Relays, and the following
week is the Big East conference meet
at Villanova.

On May l4, the Panthers host the
Pitt Invitational, which is followed
one week later by the IC4A (Inter-
collegiate Amateur Athletic Associ-
ation of America) championships.
Vasvary is looking for an invita-
tional for the weekend of May 28,
and the season closes with the
NCAA championships a week later.
NOTES: Freshman basketball"-!I""i.l
player Brian Mitchell will be com-
peting this spring. According to Vas-
vary, he will compete in the long '

chell is in the running for a spot on
the 400-meter relay team.
