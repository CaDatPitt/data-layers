Frats Claim
"Name" Band
.Vio|a’recl Pact

IF Council’s social committee
and Jimmy Dorsey tangled this
week over an alleged contract vio-
lation of the part of the sax-play-
ing bandleader.

The frat men charge Dorsey
broke portions of the pact he
signed when he agreed to play for
the IF formal on Dec. 20.

Bob. Brundy, who booked the
band, is acting as mediator. It
was Brundy who modiﬁed the
non—write-in clause contract.

The agreement which accom-
panied the original contract read
in part that Dorsey and his band
would appear in formal dress and
the names of his players would
be listed on the back of the con-
tract preceded by social security
numbers. C

It also stipulated that $1250
(one-half of the total band cost)
would be paid before the dance. I

If representatives claim com-
plete violation of the contract.

, Ned Mclhtosh, faculty advisor
to fraterni.ties, said earlier this
week that “the band wore any-
thing but formal clothes and the
names were not printed on the
contract. IF did pay the $125-0.”

It was rumored the afternoon
of the dance that the band would
not wear tuxedos which prompted
IF members to object to Brundy.
He promised them union repre-
sentation that evening._ No union
iman attended.

Dorsey claimed that the band

i ‘was uninformed of the extra con-

tract clause. The agent challenges
the validity of a letter as part of

' the contract.

Settlement is still pending al-
though some arrangement may be
worked out this week. IF is with-
holding the remainer of the fee
until agreement is reached.

Congress
Discusses

Pitt. Chest

At last Tuesday’s weekly meet-
ing, Student Congress turned
mainly from thoughts of the re-
cent Christmas recess to thoughts
of Pitt Chest Council, the Student
by—laws, and the relations of Stu-
dent Congress with the student
body. _

The legislature resolved that
the chairman of the Pitt Chest
Council should be elected by the
student members from one of its
three permanent faculty mem-
bers, the dean of women or as-
sistant, the dean of men or as-
sistant, and the bursar or assist-
ant. .
Gerard Obert and Flora Die-
mart were chosen as the junior
and sophomore members ‘of the
Council and it was agreed that the
Chancellor should appoint to aid
the yearly Pitt Chest drives any
four faculty members who have
professional or personal interest
in the Community Fund.

The Constitutional Committee,
is to investigate the by-laws
of the Congressional Consti-
tution and make suggestions for
modiﬁcations. Mary Jane Mitchell

. was, appointed chairman.

Decide Issue

Pitt men have
their supremacy.
In a thoroughly heated poli-
tical election VVednesd_ay, Pitt
men voted 1.664 to the women’s
798, just 68 ballots above the
required two-thirds maj0r.ity,i
to amend the Student Con-
gress Constitution in favor of
the men. I
The amendment, calling for a
ratio of two-to-one represen-
tation on Congress, goes into
-effect in time for spring elec-
tions.

Ellsworth Decides

Credit for swinging the vote
towards the male camp went to
the men at Ellsworth Center who
cast a nine-to-one favorable bal-
lot. The engineers, ordinarily a .
male stronghold, dropped behind‘
Chuck Davis, president of Men’s
Council and one of the leaders“
of the opposition quarters. The
engineers registered majority vote _.
but failed to push the two-thirds
ﬁgure. ‘ 1
Poll watchers reported that no‘
clear-cut line could be placed on
the male-female vote. In many’
instances, the women cast ballots
toward the measure. I _
Next year’s Congress, under.
speciﬁcation of the amendment,
will number ten men and ﬁveil
women. The male representation
will be made on the basis of four
juniors, four seniors, the presi-p
dent of Men’s Council, and an-.;
a other elected representative of the
Council. ‘I
The women on Congress will be
listed as two seniors, two juniors, ,’
and the president of Women's Self .
Government Association.
Blackstone, Workmaster Victory
Passage of the amendment was
a political victory for Franklin
Blackstone, president of Inter-
fraternity Council, and Stuart
Workmaster, publicity director for
the Panther, originators and .most
prominent advocates Tfof the bill.

The total vote count of 2462 is
the highest schoolwide vote re-
corded here in recent years. The
large count is attributed to the
use of letters and‘ handbills dis-
tributed during the two--day catn-
paigns. '

  ‘Good llmen
’  Many walls and cries of anguish ﬁlled the
j‘ ff;Cath'edral halls late Wednesday afternoon
T  when the results of the election became known.
, The opposition camp virtually cried in their
beer. i ‘
On the other side of the fence, political
big shots beamed happily, if somewhat ner-
rvously, over the close outcome.
But, on the .whole, although the vote was
 . close, the student body voted. To our knowl-
' edge, it is the highest recorded ballotting in
many years on the Pitt campus. This, in it-
self, is of more interest than the actual out-
come. It shows that a political campaign, re-
gardless of duration, will create interest far
if and above the ‘-‘goody good” ,election.l
Whatever we thought of the compromise
- proportionality amendment, the students want
‘it, more than two to one. It will be in effect for
the spring elections. With the political experi-
ence gained in this election, the spring term
campaigns should be ‘lulus.’

New
Look ‘

Men Are Against H‘:

Buf "New Look" Is Here '

By Mike Levine A
News item from The Baltimore Sun, Sept. 26-

Proving that staid cabinet ministers take an in-
terest in a well turned leg, Sir Stafford Cripps made
a statement before a meeting of the Light Cloth-
ing Association. “ 

“The shorter the skirt the better,” he said.
Further qualifying his remark, he continued “. .
although there must be some limits introduced by
considerations.”

* * 1*

His statement, we are told, was made with con—

Acerniover the conservation of cloth, but whatever,
his motives, Sir Stafford received a hearty Aroaré

of approval from men all over America. 3

At the University of Pittsburgh sentiment-among 1
the male students has leaned heavily towards Sirv
Staﬂ’ord’s opinion although one feature of the con— '
troversy was the settlement of the semi—formal

At an engineering school dance, dress was pre-.
scribed to be semi—formal. At that time (prior to
the “new look”) exacting students argued the point
that a semi—formal dance was improper and that
the women should wear either formal or informal
clothes and their escorts must dress accordingly.

” With current skirt lengths being somewhere
between that of evening gowns and street» clothes
the problem has been taken out of the hands of
the men. Perhaps at one of the coming social af-
fairs we may see some of the more daringmale
clothes——horses inpleated shirt, dinner jacket, and
plaid slacks.

Where will the “new look” stop? _If it spreads
to men’s fashiond will students lounge in the Tuck
Shop in swing collar and army shoes? How would a
plaid shirt look with a morning coat?‘ Will pon-
chos come back into style? .

Sir Stafford ‘Cripps is right. There must‘ be a
limit put to this thing. The U. S. Bureau of Stand-
ards should step in to control a fad that is snow-
balling to enormous proportions.’ It will take a
government agency to do it because such a minor
thing as male opinion certainly can’t.

Makes One Nife Stand
A! Rankin. Arena

’ By Jerry Newberg
V The Lionel Hampton band, which in the past
few years has risen to the top as both a personal
appearance "attraction and a recording name be-
cause of its ability to please the eye as well as the
ear will make a stand at the Rankin Sports Arena
Thursday evening, Jan. 15. .
Hampton, ﬁrst a jazz name as “vibe” star with
the Benny Goodman band, heads a ‘crew that pays
just as much attention to its musicianship. as it
does to its showmanship. His records for the
Decca label and a few of his latest releases are:
“Atom Blew His Hat,” “Reminiscing Mood,”
‘“’H'amps Got A Duke,” “Gone Again,” “I Miss
You So,” and “One Little Tear Is An Ocean.”

Wax Wise . .
Harry James latest Columbia release ‘which fea-
tures the tunes “Forever Amber” and “Lone Star

Moon” reveals the power and range of the big,
- James band and the imagination of his arranging.

. . . The new Sinatra platter is “My Cousin Loue1-
la” which is a cute song about a gal that sets the
town on -ﬁre. A bouncy, jivey trio backing gives
this recording. the intimate feeling of a jazz out-
ﬁt and spots some nice guitar and piano stuff be-
tween the vocals. Its plattermate “What’ll I Do”
is the old standard love ballad and done in the
Sinatra dreamy style‘ . . . Woody Herman tells
us “I Told Ya I Love Ya, Now Get Out.” It’s a
tale of a ‘guy who’s a little tired of his gal’s an-
tics and tells her so in no uncertain terms. Paired
with this“ tune is" “If Anybody Can Steal My
Baby,” another number done in Woody’s charac-
teristic style . . . Don’t miss Frankie Laine’s very
ﬁne arrangement of the oldie “Shine.” Done as.
only Laine can do it, this number is a good lively
jump tune. On the ﬂipover is “Put Yourself In
My Place Baby.”

And according to Paul Pearson,
reporting on college life abroad
for Varsity——the young man’s

impressed by England’s system of
education.

“Casual” is the word to describe

American counterpart (but no
more “eager”), is jolly without
being a black-slapper, and tends
to “talk shop” constantly.

Pearson concludes his overseas

the Americans to act like “cow
boys.” ‘Instead, he declares, they
now say:
thoughtful, and quick to return
hospitality. And their personality
is second to none.”

“Promoting School Spirit at
Pitt,” will be -the subject of Ike
Icardi’s speech to the freshmen
men at the Pitt YMCA Men’s Club
smoker next Monday at 7:45 p. m.,
in the social room of Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial.

Students attending the smoker
need pay no admission and will
be supplied with plenty of smokes,
food, and entertainment.

The main idea of the affair is to
acquaint the freshmen men from
the main campus and Ellsworth
Center with each other at an in-
formal meeting.

Ever since'Adam and Eve set
uphousekeeping people have been"

’ getting married, and these mar-

riages have presented problems.
-For the most part‘ the issues’
caused by these marriages, were
purely the personal problems of
the parties involved, and outside

- interference or judgment was left

completely out of the picture.
However, with the apparent

breakdown of American home life

a professional busy body known

-_ as theymarriage counselor has

made his
scene.
Everybody Advises

But not pnly has the counselor
entered the picture. College pres-
idents, psychologists, psychia-
trists, social workers, and mem-
bers of other professions have en-
tered the ﬁeld that that previously
had been largely the province. of

appearance on the

 

These comparative newcomers
have studied, dissected, and com-
_’mented on the ageless institution.
They have brought forth reams of
papers containing .a great number
of statistics on the subject. And
in the colleges they have insti-

A.

tuted highly popular courses on
material" relations.

In the past 25 years marriage
has been discussed and examin-
ed‘, as at no‘ time before, and the
only wonder about this new-found
interest is that it hasn't occurred

- sooner.

H Divorces Increasing

Perhaps the greatest single
cause of the attention marriage is
now receiving is the rising U. S.
divorce» rate. In 1890 there was

‘one divorce for every 17 mar-

riages, but in 1946 there were 11

ﬂ divorces for ‘every 32 marriages,-
I'nore‘th’an' one for every three. ~

‘ The ﬁrst pertinent fact ‘pointed.

out by the research is that Sol’-‘

)? .

 

G. V. Hamilton, a New. York
psychiatrist," spent four years
studying the marriages of 200
men and; women, and at the end
of this time he stated that “the
proper attitude of the" parents to-
ward the child is the only sure
cure for the ills of matrimony to-
day.”

By ‘proper attitude? Dr. Ham-
ilton was primarily referring to
the sex‘ instruction given the
children. He found that the great-
est single cause of unhappiness
was sexual maladjustment, and
that this maladjustment was

' practically all traceable to child-

hood.

Marriage Education 7

The ﬁndings of the Planned
Parenthood Clinic of Pittsburgh
have substantiated those of Dr.
Hamilton. Last year the Clinic.
handled 3,277 new patients and
found that between 50 and 60
per cent claimed that they were
unhappy sexually, for which the
clinic blamed improper marriage
education by. the parents.

Other interesting statistics show
that there are four times as many
divorces for childless couples, and
that separations between, people
of different religious faiths some-
times run as high as 15 times the
normal rate.

Courtship Changes

Dr. Ralph Eckert, consultant in
parent-education for the Califor-

'nia "state department of education,

stated that courtship failures were
the basic cause for the rise in di-
vorce rate.»

Dr. Eckert said, “Movies, the
automobile and modern, so-called
romantic literature have altered
completely the pattern of court-
ship and have started most of
the ‘trouble which leads to di-
vorc-evor other maritals unhappi-
ness.”

But as_ a solution Dr. Eckert al-
so comes back to the proposition
that the responsibility rests on
parents. At the present time he is
seeking to educate parents to pro-
perly educate their children.

Education Solution

From every directidn the men
and women ‘who have studied the
situation say that education- is the
solution. Preferably beginning in
early childhood, but for those who

Tare’ past _ch,il.dhood education , is

 

still the answer.

students are “up in arms protest-
ing against the failure of the in-
stitutions to prepare for the most
important experience of their
,lives—marriage.” And he goes on
to say, “Wherever good courses

in marriage are offered they be-

come the most popular courses.”

Pitt Olfers Course

Here at Pitt such a course is
taught by Dr. Auleen Jamison,
director of student health service
for women, and is open to stu-
dents who are seniors. Education

 

for marriage is also available, for
a $5 fee, at the Planned Parent-
hood Clinic of Pittsburgh.

As a parting shot Dr. Hamilton
asserts, “No man and woman
ought to marry unless they are so
compulsively in love with each
other that at the time of marriage
they have an unqualiﬁed convic-
tion that they will wish to live to-
.gether until the end of their
lives.”

Pitt law student Robert Baird,

Keesport, Clairton, and Duquesne.

Mr. Baird, 30, will head the De-
partment of Parks and Recreation
on the Clairton council as a Dem-
ocratic member. Father of two
children, he is going to plan the
best for the youth of the city.

Before the war, during which he
served in the Navy, Mr. Baird at-
tended Penn State where he was
the intercollegiate boxing champ.

Elevators Simulate
Weekly ‘Florida Run’

— \The Pittsburgh department store elevator operators have
nothing on the blue—coated$m’en at_ Pitt.

The mob of Christmas shoppers with their back—jabbing
packages have dispersed for anotheryear, but the book-laden
students are still surging in and out of the eight elevators at
the “Skyscraper University” and the Pitt elevator operators
are still traveling 230 vertical miles each day. A

If they could travel those miiese

in a horiontal direction, and if
the students could do without
them, the operators could make a
round trip to Florida each week
or to California each month. It
would be a slow trip. At present
the elevators are set’ to travel
500 feet a minute.

“I can make it to the 36th ﬂoor

in 43 seconds on automatic with

no stops,” said Ed Frey, who has
been riding the cables for .six
years. He admits that couldn’t be
done between 10:30 and 1:30, the
most rushed of the rush hours.

As for the number of passen-
gers that use the elevators each
day, the operators agree that it’s
a “good many thousands.” .

The local elevators hold 14 pas-

sengers and the express elevators’

18. They usually carry a full load.
The wear and tear on the over-
worked elevators is enough to
keep two electricians employed
full time to repair them.

tors at Pitt have more than their

Story of Pitt's
War Years
Told in Bulletin

A bulletin attempting to record
as fully as possible the ways in
which Pitt helped to win the war
was published recently by the
University.

Section one of the bulletin
deals with the major happenings
of the months before Pearl Har-
bor, showing Pitt’s preparation for
the national emergency.

The second unit tells the roles
of Army and Navy outﬁts sta-
tioned at Pitt. The third part re-
counts the contributions of each
school to the war training pro-
gram.

Part four lists research con-
tracts with the government, and
part ﬁve covers miscellaneous
wartime activities. Finally, a ros-
ter of Pitt students, faculty mem-
bers, and alumni who served in
the Armed forces ﬁlls the y con-
cluding pages. Of these 10,000, the
list shows that 249 died in service.

Married veterans attending
school under Public Law 16 who
have 30 per cent or more disa-
bility pension and unreported de-
pendent children must notify the
Veterans administration training
ofﬁcers immediately in order to
receive a subsistence increase.

In September such cases were
given an increase, but now it has
been found that there are still
some such qualiﬁed students
whose child or children’ have not
been reported to the Administra-
tion. ,

Prior to September, those who
now qualify for increase would
not have received more subsist-
ence for their children, and so in
some cases did not bother to in-
form their training officers of such
facts.

These veterans may arrange for
their increase by getting in touch
with the training ofﬁcers without
delay. VA is located on the sec-
ond ﬂoor, 3812 Forbes street, cor-
ner of Forbes and Bouquet streets.

DiMatteo

I Tony DiMatteo, Pitt halfback
and draftee of the Pittsburgh
Steeler professional football club,
said Tuesday that he would prob-
ably remain with the Panthers for
another season.

“I have not been contacted by
the Steelers,” said DiMatteo, “and
really know nothing about the sit-
uation except that I am. on the
Steeler’s draft list. That much I
read in the papers. -

“Off hand,” he continued, “I
would say that I will still be with

Pitt next season as I have one‘

more season of eligibility left.”

DiMatteo, who entered Pitt in
1941 but since then spent time in
the service, is legal game for the
pro scouts, for his class has been

 ‘graduated.

A Steeler official, in a telephone

ﬁrmed reports that ‘DiMatteo was
on the draft list, but refused to

He also said that the Steelers

may take place.

Excels on Kickoff Returns

DiMatteo has let it be known
that he “deﬁnitely” wants to play
in the pro ranks at some future
time.

The Panther halfback ﬁrst hit
the headlines in 1942 when he re-
turned a kickoff 98 yards for a
touchdown against Minnesota. In
the recent Pitt-Notre Dame game
he carried a kickoff 54 yards, fail-

ing to score only because of ’ a
missed block.

Although the Panthers hold the

Piﬁ, Tech Esfablisl-it   ‘
Chamber of Horrors

By John Golightly

The Society for ‘the Prevention of Cruelty to Basketball Fans
overlooked a good bet Wednesday evening. Had they been on the
job, they might have prevented the 40 minutes of suffering endured
by more than 1400 of the Stadium faithful. _

Given free reign, de-emphasis ‘bust out all over’ as Pitt and Tech
set district basketball back ﬁve years with a demonstration of in-
eptitude unmatched in recent years. For the record, Pitt won, 46-40.

Game statistics merely empha-4‘

sized the fortitude of today’s col-
lege students. The two contestants
let ﬂy with 109 shots and taxed
thelaw of averages to the limit
in sinking 29. Pitt garnered 17
out of 59, while the Tartans reg-
istered 12 times in 50 attempts:

The two officials halted the hor-
rible display on 50 occasions. This
sent the hopeless Techs trottir("
to the foul line 31 times where
they added to the holocaust by
missing 15 free throws.

Not to be outdone, however,

Carlson’s Caravan matched Tech’s
impotence with 15 missﬁres in '27
tries.

Still hopeful that he can bring
basketball back to‘ the Pitt cam-
pus, Dr. H. C. Carlson -kept six
subs shuttling between the bench
and the court without achieving
any improvement.

At the ﬁnal whistle, there was at‘
cheer which was neither loud not
long. But as an expression -of re-
lief, -» it would be difﬁicult to
match.

lack of applicants, an article in
Varsity, the young man’s maga-
zine, reveals.

According to a nation-wide sur-
vey made by the publication.
thousands of dollars in school aid
go begging each year simply be-
cause students are unaware of the
fact that the grants exist.

Moreover, the belief that pro-
ﬁciency in studies is the only
basis for scholastic awards has
-discouraged individuals who may
be eligible for other reasons.

<

Even such obvious sources of:
student assistance as government;

aid to the families‘ of World War
I veterans are often ignored, the
magazine article declares.

Other forms of grant-in-aid;

which go unused are those given‘

on the basis of religion; those
granted by countries, cities, and
states ("in which the applicant re-_

sides) to students who pledge to

teach in local schools; and tlioscs
awarded as prizes by gcrvernmena

officials. social. and fraternal or-

ganizations, and industries.
Four sources of information on

available scholarships is included

in the Varsity report.

1. Local Boards of Education
provide lists of city and state
sch olarships.

 Library reference books men-
tion all new scholarships an-
nounced in newspapers and mag-
azines.

3. University catalogues list
scholarships available at the indi-
vi dual institution.

4. A government publication,
“Scholarships and Fellowships,”
available through the Government
Printing office in Washington, D.
C., discusses"‘most of the available
Amer; tan student aid grants.
