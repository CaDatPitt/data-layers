_ Tax Exemptions

Plan For Removing Fraternity
Houses From Taxable List
Presented To Council

-._..—

A plan to enable fraternities on cam-
pus supporting houses to escape pay-
ment of taxes on their properties in
the future was submitted at the reg-
ular meeting of Interfraternity coun-
cil Tuesday evening.

It is a duplicate of the plan in force
at the University of Pennsylvania,
was put in concrete form by a Pitts-

burgh lawyer, and was submitted to
the council by Bernard Silverblatt,
C34, head of a committee investigat-
ing the possibilities of adopting such
a plan here.

At Penn, the university acts as
virtual owner of the houses, calls them
fraternity dormitories, collects the in-
come from them, which is placed
toward the credit of the various fra-
ternities, holds a deed of trust for
each house, and reserves the right
to place non-fraternity men and other
students in them in order to ﬁll them
up.

One of the stipulations before the
university takes over a house is that
it be debt free or that its income be
sufficient to guarantee its upkeep and
the meeting of mortgage and other
obligations.

The plan will shortly be brought to
the attention of the administration
here. Thus far, no overtures have
been made to the University to under-
take such a move.

An indoor interfraternity track
meet was sanctioned by the council,
to take place about March 10 at the
track house. Based on the procedure
of the recent interfraternity boxing
tournament, the meet will include all
member fraternities. An expensive
trophy, valued at $200, will be do-
nated through Carl Olson, varsity
track coach, which will not be per-
manent, but will go to the winner of
the meet each year. The council also
approved a pingpong tournament to
begin the first week of the second
semester, and a basketball tournament
beginning about the same time. The
pingpong tournament will last about
a week and will be of an elimination
nature.

King Derr, C35, head of a committee
investigating rushing inefficiencies and
attempting to draw up a new rush-
ing code, reported that the commit-
tee has not conducted suﬂicient meet-
ings to formulate procedure to be
ready for second semester rushing.
He stated that his committee had
planned in connection with its new
policy, a change in the date of rush-
ing week to a time later in the semes-
ter. Rushing, February 19, will be re-
tained.

Leroy Lewis, C34, chairman of the
Interfraternity Ball, reported that his
committee would meet today and make
tentative arrangements for the an-
nual affair. Ralph Appel, co-chair-
man of the fraternity forum commit-
tee, reported that the ﬁrst forums
would take place this Monday night,
with an extensive list of speakers pre-
pared.

A motion was passed suspending
on January 25 all fraternities which
have not yet paid their dues to the
organization from participation in
council. A subsequent motion, urging
the suspension on the same day of
all fraternities which have not yet
paid up all obligations incurred at the
Interfraternity Conference day in No-
vember was defeated.

study for high school subjects.

These workers, according to Theo-
dore A. Siedle, acting director of the
Teachers’ Appointm.ent bureau and
local representative for William H.
Bristow, state department of public
education ofﬁcial, began the investiga-
tive work this week. They will con-
tinue until February 15, unless the

are extended.

Almost all of those engaged on the
project are University of Pittsburgh
graduates, Mr. Siedle said_ They were
selected from among the persons reg-
istered with the Teachers’ Appoint-
ment bureau and were chosen because
of their speciﬁc abilities,

The project includes the prepara-
tion of state courses of study in
English, history, social sciences, math-

1800 Registered
As Early Period
Closes Tomorrow

Place Of Registration Changed
From State Hall To Mosque
For Second Semester

Indications pointed to a. last minute
rush today and tomorrow as the office
of the registrar prepared for an ex-
ceptionally neavy last minute press
of students wishing to register before
the special period closes tomorrow.
Up until yesterday morning only 1800
students had completed registration,
Registrar John G, Quick stated

Reminders have been sent to those
students who shoe‘rl'd~*have registered
but haven’t up to the present time,
and Mr. Quick expects a. large per-
centage of the 2000 students who
have not registered to take» advantage
of this new plan of advance registra-
tion. This is the second year this op-
portunity has been extended to the
students of the University, and Mr.
Quick is especially enthusiastic about
it because the students are not re-
quired to pay their tuition when they
register unless they desire to do so.

Registrar Quick also announced
that the registration headquarters for
new and incompleted registration has
been changed from the Cathedral,
where it usually is held, to the Syria
Mosque. He explained that the rea-
son for the change to the Syria
Mosque is to eliminate the congestion
and confusion that would result if so
large a number of students should
have to register in the Cathedral at
such a time as this, when all its facil-
ities are being used to further the con-
struction work under the CWA pro-
gram.

“Register today and tomorrow,”
urged Mr. Quick, “so that you may en-
joy a ﬁve-day mid-semester vacation.”
And he expected the majority of the
remaining students to do so today
and tomorrow,

Work Will Begin

$400,000 Goal Reached; To Be
Situated On Cathedral
Quadrangle

W'ith deﬁnite word that the $400,000
goal has been reached, and that work
on the Stephen Collins Foster memo-
rial will begin in the spring, the idea
of the Cathedral with its surrounding
buildings has become an actuality.
Chancellor John G. Bowman an-

nounced the plans for the memorial
Saturday.
The building will be located on the

.-Cathedral quadrangle on the corner

opposite the entrance to Schenley
park. The main building of the
memorial will be an auditorium, with
seating accommodations for about 750
persons, and provisions for reception
and rehearsal rooms below. Con-
nected to the main building by means
of cloistered passages, will be the
shrine to Stephen Collins Foster. In-
side the shrine will be housed the en-
tire collection of Foster material,
known as “Fosteriana,” collected by
Dr. J. K_ Lilly, of Indianapolis, and
donated to the project by him.

The auditorium will harmonize both
in its Gothic architecture, and stone
work with the Cathedral and other
buildings. The architect is Mr.
Charles Z. Klauder, who also designed
the Cathedral and the Heinz chapel.

Dr. Bowman said of the memorial:
“The greatest music, after all, is the
kind without sound. Some day Pitts-
burgh will realize that a symphony
which grips the whole of life rises
from the square of land upon which
the Foster memorial is to stand.
There will be this little theater, which
really sings of the love of home. In
the high building, beside it, with more
powerful lines, an ideal of courage
and of spirituality blends into the
theme. To the right, as you face the
Foster memorial, will be the Heinz

Memorial chapel, now under con-
struction, which will add another
note, this one of pure spiritua.lit_v.

Student Abilities

{Entrance To Education Courses‘

Determined By Scale

Rating scales to , determine the

opinions of instructors upon the “hal-
iﬁcations of pre-education students are
being ﬁlled out in a number of key
courses. These judgments, according

the dean of the School of Education,
will be used in assisting the com-
mittee on admissions to pass upon
pre-education students who apply for
admission to the school at the end of
their sophomore year.

The forms are being ﬁlled out by
instructors in Public Speaking 1 and
25; Education 3 and 21; Psychology
3; and English 21.

The rating scale includes eight
items upon which instructors are
asked to give their judgment of each
student. The judgments are speciﬁed
by a check mark in one of ﬁve cat-
egories: superior, above average,
average, below average and poor.

The qualiﬁcations include personal
appearance, speech, the use of
English, forcefulness, good judgment,
resourcefulness, sense of responsibility
and the instructor's opinion as to the
sdegree of success which the student is
likely to have as a teacher.

Third Violation
Of Dance Rules
Given Hearing

Student Relations Group Calls
Sigma Alpha Mu To Report
On “Breakfast Dance”

The third reported violation of
dance restrictions came before student
relations committee yesterday, when
Nathan Ganger, BA34, social chairman
of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, was
called to the group meeting in Heinz
House.

Sigma Alpha Mu, the committee
noted, had sponsored a breakfast
dance at Webster Hall last New Year’s
eve. Previously the fraternity had
informed the committee that the at-u
fair was alumni-directed. Following
the dance, however, reports published
in the News intimated that active

Rules of the committee speciﬁcally
prohibit so-called “breakfast dances.”
Hours of the‘ SAM dance were from
midnight until 4 o’clock,

The petition of the Junior Prom
was the last cause of debate in the
relations group. After a twohnd one-
half hour session, during which H.é
Ellsworth Mil1er’s reputed query to[
Chairman Ray McCune, “V\/‘hat if we‘
don’t?”.was the basis of discussion,
the committee decided to refuse the
petition.

Student relations intimated in its
action that it had grown tired of
“rubber stamping” all dance petitions,|
whether they violated regulations or
not. Members favoring rejection

pointed out that a rebuke to the Junior

Prom committee, directing one of the
“biggest” events of the year, would
set a. favorable precedent, and would
enhance the prestige of the relations
body. Those opposing refusal, asked
the reason for the “sudden outburst
of righteousness” after all previous
violations had been condoned,

The reversal by Student council of
its subcommittee’s ruling on the Prom
was unaccompanied by ofﬁcial cen-
sure or restrictions. Yesterday student
relations heard the SAM case with
its power unimpaired.

Ray Bowser, social chairman of Phi
Gamma Delta, was the ﬁrst to appear
before the committee for dance vio-
lations. He was accused of “neg-
ligence” in failing to register hostesses
for a, fraternity affair.

Kappa Phi Meets At Tech

The regular dinner meeting of

ings by Muriel Magee and Pearl Mc-
Kissock, a song by the Tech Trio,
and a talk on Russia, given by Har-
riet Carter, an instructor in Frick.

Experienced Cast Will Present

ties of Dorothy Kaufman, C35, who in
the coming role has been assigned

Janet Robbins, C34, although new to

Delegates Hear Advocates Urge
Capitalism, Alternatives At
YM-YWCA Conference

A spirit of scepticism as to the real
value of the NIRA and the NRA to
the working class and consumer was
expressed by student delegates at the
intercollegiate political conference,
“Which VVay America?” of the Uni-
versity YM-YKVCA.

The conference sought to determine
the fundamental values of a political
or economic theory to lead to a closer
relationship between production and
consumption. All of the 135 delegates,
representing seventeen schools, were
agreed that unrestricted competition
in industry was no longer desirable.
Many of the delegates maintained that
industry should be completely reg-
ulated.

A conservative group of students
defended progressive capitalism, un-
der which they would keep, as a min-
imum, private ownership and opera-
tion of basic industries,

Other delegates maintained that
progressive capitalism was socialism,
and others, that it was merely the
necessary concessions of a decaying
capitalistic system.

Charges of “chiseling” in the Pitts-
burgh district were stated before Wil-
liam E. Sweet, former governor of
Colorado, who spoke on the NRA be-
fore the group Friday evening.
Charges were made that the arbitra-
tion boards of the NRA, essentially
representing the employer, would not
give labor a fair chance in a dispute
brought before them, Sweet, in de-
fending the NRA, stated that the
powers in Vvashington were far from
pleased with the work of the present
boards and that new boards in every
state would be set up with men em-
ployed and paid by the government
in charge.

When Francis Henson, secretary of
the League Against W'ar and Fascism,

was questioned‘ whether "a*pro~Ietarian*

revolution in a highly industrialized
country such as the United States,
would not lead to chaos and desolation
rather than a victory for either side,
he agreed.

“Anot.her Mussolini, if he dies? No,
there can be no other Mussolini, but
Italy will carry on the plans of our
great leader; for we will not nor can-
not fail his inspiration,” said Signor
M. Stancati in reply to question about
Fascism.

“Labor will get its best breaks un-
der a progressive capitalistic system,”
said John Bracken, C34, co-chairman
of the conference, in one of the dis-
cussions on the relation of labor
unions and political systems. Many of
the delegates differed, contending that
as long as there is a competitive in-
dustrial set—up in the hands of private
individuals with proﬁt as a prime
motive, labor would not get any
breaks, only necessary concessions, re-
gardless of the political system.

Some of the discussions centered
about the religious approach to a new
social, political or economic order.
While admitting that many of the
views of Christ, if followed out, would
lead to ideal conditions in all phases
of life, many of the students felt that
most churches in the present form are
fairly impotent to aid in any mass
change.

Of the 135 delegates to the confer-
ence, eight were from California
Teachers college; seven, Erie Center;
six, Grove City; six, Bethany; ﬁve,
Allegheny, Carnegie Tech, Edinboro
Teachers college, Pennsylvania Col-
lege for VVon1en and West Virginia
VVesleyan; four, Johnstown Center,
VVest Virginia university and Geneva
college; three, Westminster; one from
Washington and Jefferson, Duquesne
and Penn State, and sixty-ﬁve dele-
gates from the University of Pitts-
burgh.

The Investigators Vanish
HE MOST PROMISING legislative creation at Pitt
this year, the investigating group of student relations
committee, seems to have died an unnatural death. The
group did excellent work in its investigation of John
Marshall club and Druids. Then, all of a, sudden, like
some good genie, it vanished into
thin air. 1
As a result of the ﬁndings of the
- investigating group John Marshall
club altered its constitution to
make the fraternity really an hon-
orary and increased the activities
of the fraternity. Nothing came
out of the Druid incident, even
though the committee found many
things wrong with that sophomore
honorary. Almost immediately after
the investigation of the sophomore
honorary the investigations com-
mittee disappeared. What,happen-
ed to it?
Mr. McCune, Mr. Bracken, and
Mr. Danahey did commendable
Bracken work as members of the investigat-
ing committee. The group apparently must have step-
ped on the toes of some powerful student political group
on the campus. Else, why has the group been so uncere-
moniously shelved? And what happened to its excellent
report on Druids? And what has the Druid organization
done about it?

 

Any Gentlemen In The House?

ADDER THAN LOSING a close basketball game last

Friday night were the ungentlemanly demonstrations
that took place in the spectators’ stands throughout the
contest. Entirely uncalled for, the booing and hooting
of rival players by Pitt students and Pitt sympathizers
left a blot on the evening’s entertainment.

Duquesne unquestionably had an excellent team, a bet-
And, true, that the Du-

Coach CaI‘1S0I1’.S boys played the best basketball they
knew. They played it in the best Pitt tradition, cleanly,
spiritedly, and heatedly_ They played the kind of bas-
ketball that Pitt is famed for, that Pitt teams have al-
ways been famed for. If the boys had lain down on the
job perhaps some demonstrations might have been ex-
pected. But the score shows anything but quitting.
Perhaps Pitt has worked a wrong psychology on its
students. We can’t seem to take defeat. Successful ath-
letic teams might have turned our heads 3. little, and

cause we can’t beat him. Duquesne has beaten us every
time we've played them on the court. Close scores every
time, but beaten us just the same.
as though we can take it.

VVe can’t believe that the Pitt student body is like
that. We’d rather believe that a, certain element, a. small
group, caused the disturbance. At any rate, one way or
the other, Pitt students are to blame. If the situation
continues it will be a. blot on Pitt’s excellent athletic
record. Give our opponents a break even though they’re
winning. If we can’t win we can at least be gentlemen.

 

Another Good Conference

HE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on world af-

fairs which took place on the campus over the week-
end takes its place as another in the series of student
conference on important affairs that was started by
John P. Bracken three years ago. Although nothing
startling came out of the recent conference, it succeeded
in giving the delegates an opportunity to air their per-
sonal views on Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, and
Socialism.

Outstanding in the list of accomplishments of the con-
ference can be shown the increase in the number of
schools represented, the number of out-of-town delegates
present, the number of Pitt delegates to take part, and
the ﬁnancial solvency of the affair. For these accom-
plishments, Marguerite Swank and John P. Bracken, co-
chairmen of the conference, are to be complimented.

Another large conference of this kind sometime during
the next semester ought to be considered. Bracken prob-
ably has the idea for one tucked away somewhere al-
ready. And one more real conference this year will liven
up things around’ this school.

And it doesn't look .

By John Hesselbein

Trends in department store sales
are shown in a. feature article written
by the members of the staff of the
University bureau of business re-
search and appeared in the latest is-
sue of the Pittsburgh Business Re-
view. The bureau has gathered data
from ten Pittsburgh department stores
for the period from 1929 to the pres-
ent, and has compared it with infor-
mation which is based on seven local
stores since 1919 printed by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

The article points out the extreme
seasonal changes in business that de-
partment stores experience annually.
The Christmas and Easter seasons
are the peak periods in department
store business, while the periods im-
mediately followfing Christmas and
Easter rushes are characterized as
“great lulls.”

In the period since 1919, the article
stated, there has been a noticeable
change in the average seasonal dis-
tribution of trade within the year.
Sales in the months January, March,
July, and November have become
smaller relative to annual totals;

sales in April, May, September, Octo-
ber, and December
larger relative to the annual totals.
The largest annual “dollar volume”
of sales in the entire period, 1919 to
1933, came in 1923, according to the
Review. Since then, it declares, in
every year but 1929, this amount has
been on the decline, the greatest de-
cline, of course, coming after 1929.
The article is quick to point out,
however, that this rapid decline since
1929 could possibly be due to the shift
in buying to lower grades of merchan-
dise. The net change in physical vol-
ume of sales, it shows, was very
much the same as the change in dol-
lar totals since 1923, however, Both
these ﬁgures fell rapidly after 1929,
the dollar volume falling farther be-
cause of the marked decline in prices.
“Relative to the growth of popula-

lticn and to the growth of general
lbusiness activity, the decline in the
:trend of department store sales since
1923 has been considerable.” The
probable reasons for the truth of this
statement, according to the Review,
are the “rapid suburban development,
the time and expense of going down-

August, only to decline again and
cancel a large part of the earlier ad-
vance.

Lamp-post

By Wilbur D. Clark

ERENDORF’S, THE JEWELER,
eyes glowed and he jerked
nervously as his moustache, when the
conversation at the Brown’s party
turned to “conscience.” The Browns

g were the only people in the town who

ever gave the sort of party at which
the conversation could have turned to
“conscience,” and therefore they were
the only people who could have ex-
tended an invitation to Werendorf
with any degree of certainty that he
would accept. Most parties, he
claim.ed, were a waste of time, Thai;
was because people in the town took
their bridge seriously and conversa-
tion at the card table was taboo, But
there was no bridge at the Brown’s,
and there was occasion for Werendorf
to tell one of his stories, all of which
was much to the liking of the jeweler.

Jamison, the furrier of the town,
and Mr. and Mrs. Brown drew their
chairs closer to Werendorf as they
realized that he was about to start
one of his stories. Sometimes they
were good.

“It's funny what conscience will do
to a person,” he remarked, and then
paused to light a cigarette. “A cer-
tain lady of this town came into my
shop to look at rings several months
ago. Her husband is able to pay for
all the rings that she cares to buy,
and, as I had had dealings with her
before, there was no reason why,

when the phone rang, I shouldn’t
leave the tray of rings on the counter
while I answered the phone. I did.
And when I came back I noticed that
there was one ring missing from. the
tray.

“ ‘You’ve picked one out, I see,’ I
remarked.

“ ‘Yes, I think I'll take this one.’
She picked one up, put it on her
ﬁnger, looked at it, asked how much
it was, and wrote out a check for it.
That still left a ring unaccounted for,

but not wishing to embarrass her, I,

said nothing about it.”

Wercndorf ﬂicked the ash off his
cigarette.

“Well, just the other day that
woman walked into my store again.
I knew what she had come for the
minute that she opened the door.
She reached in her bag, took out the
énis-sing ring and put it on the coun-

er.

“ ‘This is somewhat embarrassing,
Mr. W'erendorf,’ she said_ ‘I sent my
fur coat, the one I wore the day I
came in last, to be cleaned yesterday,
and they found this ring caught in
one of the cuffs.’

“I told her that it was all right. I
knew that her conscience wouldn’t let

her keep it for long.” Werenedorf
leaned back and laughed.
Mrs. Brown seemed irritated. “I

don’t think that you’re quite fair, Mr.
VVerendorf. Perhaps the explanation
that the lady gave was true.”

“Yes, my friend,” said Jamison, “I
know that it was, because I myself
found the ring.”

IT COSTS BUT LITTLE
To Telephone Home.’

MOST pleasures cost money—-some too much.

No wonder home folks say “go easy” to sons

But you’ll never (weIl——hardly ever) hear
that warning when you telephone home. For
Father and Mother the pleasure of hearing
your voice far outweighs the triﬂing cost.

After 8:30 P. M. (if you use Station to Sta-
tion Service) you can telephone a hundred
miles for 35 cents. What greater pleasure can
such a small sum buy? A “Voice visit” home

is next best to being there!

PARENTS ENDIDBSE
tlzese SUGGESTIONS . , .

Keep a regular telephone date with Home.
Then you can count on the family being
there when you call.

Set the “date” for after 8:30 P. M. to take
advantage of the low Night Rates on Sta-
tion to Station calls.

Just give the Operator your home telephone

Library Receives
Foster’s Works
In Gift Edition

Copy Of First Complete Edition
Of Pittsburgher’s Songs
Donated By Dr. Lilly

 

A complete set of copies of Stephen
Collins Foster's songs, known as
“Foster Hall Reproductions,” has been
received by the University library as
a gift from Josiah Kirby Lilly, of In-
dianapolis,

Fletcher Hodges, a representative of
Foster hall, in Pittsburgh last week
with the quartet of negro singers,
which featured the assembly Friday,
said of the gift when interviewed:
“This is the ﬁrst complete edition of
Foster’s songs ever collected. These
songs are the exact reproductions of
all the first editions of Foster's songs,
whose copyrights are in the Library
of Congress. Where the Library did
not have the copyright, Foster hall has
taken what it believes to be the
authentic ﬁrst editions. If ever Fos-
ter hall discovers a. new edition, or
a new song, it will be sent to all the
libraries that have received the sets.”

Asked as to the purpose of the
“Foster Hall Reproductions,” Mr.
Hodges said: “We have aimed to do
two things in the collection, ﬁrst, to
place in the libraries a complete rec-
ord of Foster’s works. and second, to
assist future collectors in identifying
their editions.”

The songs are divided alphabetically
into three sections, each with a com-
plete index, and enclosed in a brown

leather portfolio box. The complete
collection is in a steel case. The
University has received one of the
1,000 sets distributed by Mr_ Lilly to
libraries and individuals throughout
the United States, England and other
English-speaking countries. The set
contains the complete works of Foster
so far as is known to Foster hall, a
shrine built by Mr. Lilly to honor the
American composer.

Rushing Season
Date Announced

Men’s Rushing Week To Open
Monday, February 18

Second semester rushing season
will begin on Monday morning, Feb-
ruary 18 at 8:30 o'clock, and will con-
tinue to the following Sunday morn-
ing, according to a. motion passed by
the fraternity committee of the Uni-
versity recently.

This is the second year in which
second semester rushing has been
cut down from the usual nine-day
period. Last year, on recommenda-
tion of Interfraternity council, the
committee agreed that the shorter
period was more than adequate for
the type of rushing and the number
of rushees concerned at that time.

Four fraternities, which have not
functioned on campus for some time,
were officially declared non-existent
by the committee. Delta Sigma Phi,
Kappa Nu, Xi Psi Phi, and Sigma Pi,
all possible collections having been
made, all members having graduated,
and all creditors having been satis-
ﬁled, have had their charters and
right to operate as a fraternity at this
University revoked,

Phi Epsilon, formerly a pre-minis-
terial society_ has been recognized a-s
a. non-social, professional, pre-minis-
terial fraternity with the understand-
ing that its program shall not be
social in nature or conﬂict with any
of the existing social fraternities.

The application of the Collembola
club to become Collumbolae honorary
fraternity was not acted upon because
of lack of information. No members
of the club appeared at the meeting.

China’s Daylight Will Light
America’s Nights In Future

Dr. Silverman Dreams Of A Day When Fused Quartz

Will Convey Light,

By Annabelle Fishkin

Lighting the Cathedral with one
powerful bulb—heating slushy Pitts-
burgh from sunlight captured in the
equator——ﬂooding North America at
night with light from China, or any-
where else! According to Dr. Alex-
ander Silverman, head of the depart-
ment of chemistry, it might some day
be done. Sounds fantastic, Edgar
Rice Burroughish, preposterous,

Few things are impossible, and con-
veyed sunlight is not one of those
things, according to Dr, Silverman.
Fused quartz rods will be the means
of lighting and warming the world.
Fused quartz, one of the most trans-
parent solids known, is similar to
glass only in appearance. Considering
ultraviolet light transmission, only
two substances surpass quartz, name-
ly, the minerals ﬂuorite and topaz,
both of which are too scarce for large
scale use. Dr. Silverman stated that,
“For transmitting a wide range of
light and heat rays, transparent fused
quartz is our best bet.” X-ray, ultra-
violet—most types of rays will pass

through rods of transparent fused
quartz without appreciably losing
their intensity or characteristics.

These rods conduct heat in an un-
usual fashion. When Dr. Silverman
was in West Lynn, Massachusetts, he
visited a laboratory where there was
a piece of fused quartz about six feet
long and one-half inch thick. A pow-
erful tungsten lamp was held near
one end of the rod, while a reﬂector
focused the rays from the ﬁlament on
it, and Dr. Silverman” lit a cigarette
at the other end. It is remarkable
that the heat intensity remained al-
most unchanged, but the amazing fact
is that the rod remained cold.

Light rays and heat rays will fol-
low the rod even around curves, To
quote Dr. Silverman, “It is quite pos-
sible that some day huge rods of
quarts will encircle the earth, convey-
ing light, and warmth, to any point of
the globe where man desires to send
solar rays on this fundamental prin-
ciple of bending and conducting sun-
light and heat.”

The only thing barring experi-
mentation of this theory on a large
scale is the expense of fused quartz.
Though a process of fusing quartz, by
which large pieces could be easily
produced, was developed some years
ago, the cost is still prohibitive. A
rod of it about six inches long costs
approximately $3. Fused quartz oc-
curs in nature only as fulgarites,
which are formed by lightning dis
charging in a bed of sand. Sand and
sandstone consist of quartz grains

Heat Economically

contaminated with foreign impurities,
When the chemist devises a cheap
method for removing these impurities,
and when electricity costs so little
that the puriﬁed sand, that is quartz,
can be melted on a large scale in elec-
tric furnaces, thenvtransparent fused
quartz should be’ available at the
same price now paid for common
glass.

However, fused quartz does have a
working value in the piesent scien-
tiﬁc world. It has been drawn so
fine that it can be used to radiate the
nucleus of a cell with X-rays. Be-
cause light rays follow *1 crooked rod
of it, it is important in treating can-
cer of the nasal and other constricted
passages in the body that otherwise
would be extremely difficult to reach

Dr. Silverman’s idea is not a mere
chimera. Already the plan has been
put in practice. Dr, Silverman has
in his office a nine-inch Christmas
tree lighted with 21 bulbs, The light
for the bulbs, coming from one 15-
watt bulb at the base of the tree, is
conducted by means of ordinary
glass, and the-result is not so efficient
as fused quartz would make it. From
glass to quartz is only a step in
economy, and from toy trees to
homes, merely a, transition in magni-
tude.

“The power that man holds in
embryo, to pierce chasms of darli-
ness,” said Dr, Silverman, “will some
day be as ordinary as cable messages
today.”

Dr, Silverman is recognized as one
of the world’s authorities on glass
and owns the ﬁnest private collection
of modern glass in existence, from
the standpoint of art and technology.

Freshman Women Discuss
Constitution At Meeting

Freshman women began ratiﬁcation
of the class constitution at a mass
meeting last Friday in the Heinz
House. Because of the spirited dis-
cussions which took place, the meet-
ing was forced to adjourn before the
entire constitution had been gone
over. Another meeting will take place
shortly, ‘

Ellen Jane Dowling, chairman of
the constitutional committee, led the
meeting. The merits and demerits of
article six, Nominations and Elections,
were debated at length, with a spirited
effort to insure representation for all
schools on the nominating committee
being successful. Provision that the
defeated candidate for president

Panthers U 1) s e t
As Dukes Annex
Another Thriller

Duquesne Extends Victory List
To 21; Reiter Is Spark-
Plug Of Winners’ Play

One lax moment on the part of the
Pitt defense, which allowed Irv Bren-
ner to remain unniolested under the
Panther basket long enough to sink
an easy “sleeper shot,” enabled Du-
quesne to continue its basketball vic-
tory spell over the Carlson cagers in
the Stadium Friday night, But for
that one lapse, Russ Ochsenhirt’s long
ﬁeld goal in the last few seconds of
play would have brought victory to
the Panthers, rather than merely
cause the Duke supporters an attack
of heart failure for the fraction of
time remaining in the game. Du-

quesne ﬁnished on the long end of a
30-29 score.

The game bristled with thrilling
play from start to ﬁnish. At the out-
set, Pitt astounded the critics who
had not conceded them a chance
against the high-riding Dukes by
stepping out ahead and remained
there for the greater part of the ﬁrst
half. Just before the intermission,
Feldman and Reiter, who tied for
high-point honors of the evening, shot
in a ﬁeld goal apiece to send Du-
quesne three points ahead.

Coach “Chick” Davies must have
said something important to his boys
during the rest period, for they came
out and turned on the steam as soon
as the second half got under way. In
less than ﬁve minutes the Duke score
had reached 20 and the Panthers had
not tallied once.

All of this might have caused a
lesser team than Pitt to curl up. In
quick order, however, Charley Hughes
and Claire Cribbs each dropped in two
ﬁeld goals and then Charley added a
pair of fouls while the Dukes were
getting one two-pointer, Here the
tide turned and Duquesne once again
pulled away. It was during this spree
that Brenner sat in the lap of the
gods for his easy ﬁeld gsal,

Once again Pitt started to make up
the deﬁcit, but it was too late. Och-
senhirt, who had been shooting in
tough luck all evening, ﬁnally regis-
tered from far out to bring the local
supporters one last ray of hope but
the Dukes managed to control the ball
for the remaining few seconds and in-
sure their hard-earned victory.

It was a great game from most
standpoints. Pitt’s man—for-man de-
fense caused the Dukes no little
trouble and Duquesne’s tight zone-de-
fense forced the Panthers to do all
their successful shooting from far out,
Pitt starred at the foul line, making
11 out of 14. The officiating was the

best seen at the stadium this year.

New —Talent Wins
In Handicap Meet

Kiger, Keller, Connelly Feature
Mile Relay Tryouts

Results of the weekly handicap
meet staged at the Track house Fri-
day found several new men capturing
the ﬁrst honors in the ﬁve events on
the program, Breakiron won out in
the shot-put and Crocker captured the
Pole-vault event.

First-place repeaters from the meet
of the previous week were Atkinson
and Taano. The former was the vic-
tor in the high-jump and the latter
made the best leap among the broad-
jump entrants. One of the ﬁnest per-
formances of the meet was turned in
by Siwiski in the low-hurdles.
Siwiski, in only his second year of
hurdle competition, nosed out Good
to take ﬁrst place.

During the past week, interest up
at the Track house has centered upon
the tryouts for the mile-relay team.
Kiger turned in the best time thus
far and is certain of a place on the
team. Keller and Connelly are ﬁght-
ing it out for the second position and
either Menaker or McMunn will get
the fourth place with the relay group.
Further tryouts will continue this
week and a deﬁnite quartet is ex-
pected to be selected soon.

Coach Olson is also directing atten-
tion to his milers, Ken Wagen-
houser appears to be the best of the
group at present, having greatly im-
proved his time over that of the past
year.

Conference Leagues

Tonight’s clash at the Stadium
pavilion will afford the Panthers a
chance to tighten their grip on the
league lead in the Eastern Intercolle-
giate conference and likewise make
some headway in the city title chase.
The only obstacle which may prevent
such successes is in the form of a Car-
negie Tech cage team that looks~
much improved over the Skibos of
last year.

The Tartans have been running in
hard luck this year, losing games to
Georgetown and Temple by the
margin of a single point after sound-
ly trouncing West Virginia’s Moun-
taineers in their opening battle of the
season. Tech’s record in the Eastern
Intercollegiate conference now reads
one victory against two defeats,

The Skibo 110995 have risen more ' Cribbs has made 21 field goals and 105

than a little this year as a result of
the ﬁne work of two sophomore for-
wards, Gibson and Macalka. Macalka
is a lad who played considerable of a
guard position for four years at
Stowe high school, The veterans,
Captain Silverman and Ted Rigg, are
back at the guards for Tech and
Ewalt is again jumping center. The
loss of Lou Jagnow, a last year’s sen-
sational ball player, has hurt the
Tech chances a great deal but
Macalka and Gibson are handling the
forward positions with creditable
success and are bound to improve
with competition.

The Panthers will no doubt be on
edge after their great stand against
Duquesne and will be anxious to an-
nex the victory tonight which will;
give them a record of three wins and
no losses in the conference standings.

Informal Matches With Tech,
Dukes May Be Arranged

Plans for the University hockey
team are progressing. The team is
to he coached by Roy Schooley Jr.
C35, assisted by Carl Olson, track
coach. Schooley is the captain of the
Scott Morgan hockey team, a strong
contender in the Pittsburgh Amateur
Hockey League.

About ten candidates for the team
reported to Coach Schooley for prac-
tice last Thursday and Friday morn-
ings at Duquesne Gardens. Students
interested in trying out are requested
to get in touch with either Mr, Olson
or Mr, Schooley at the Stadium office
as soon as possible, or report for the
practice periods at Duquesne Gardens.

Both Carnegie Tech and Duquesne
are planning to sponsor hockey teams
so that informal matches between the
three city schools may be arranged.

Duke Coeds Enlighten
Uninquiring Scribe
At Cage Game

Once upon a time a Pitt News‘

sports writer conceived the brilliant
(?) idea. (?) of sitting in the Du-
quesne rooting section at a Pitt-Du-
quesne basketball game. “What a
feature story,” he said to himself;
“Now, I’ll get the real lowdown on
how Duke students feel about Pitt.”

About 6 2 30 he unobtrusively
squeezed into a seat on the Duke side
of the fence. Two girls sat in front
of him. Their conversation proved
enlightening.

Babe (the one on the left): “Well,
look at that score up on the board,
will you! 38 to 23, What nerve!”

Esther (the one on the right):

Pitt gained a share of the lead ini

over the Temple boxers at the Sta-pg

4-3. Meanwhile West Virginia’s box-
ers were downing Bucknell 6-1 to give
the Mountaineers a clean slate in the
conference also,

The evening started off in a bad
way for Pitt when Junge, ﬁghting in
the 115-pound division, and Hymie

§ Can We Take It?

The question, “Can Pitt Students Take It?” raised its ugly head
the Eastern Intercollegiate b0XingFr1day night at the Stadium as the Panther basketball team again
Conference by Scoring a_ close victory g went down_to defeat before the Dukes.

There IS no doubt about it; Pitt students are not accustomed to

losing. \Vhether this is a justiﬁable excuse for all the booing they

did at the game Friday night is a question easily settled. It is not.
V\7e have proved that we can win like gentlemen. When we are

beaten by a team which has played:

the game fairly and squarely, let us
lose like gentlemen,

Pitt students can be proud of the
manner in which their basketball
team played. Trailing at times by
nine and ten points the Panthers
never gave up, and drew to within one
point of the Dukes as the ﬁnal whistle
blew. It took real ﬁghting spirit to
do that.

The Tartans And The Irish

This week two of Pitt’s most ardent
rivals meet the Panthers on the Sta-
dium ﬂoor. Tonight Max Hannum
brings his Carnegie Tech Tartans
here, and Saturday night George
Keogan and his Notre Dame team are
Dr. Carlson’s guests.

The Tartans this year seem to have
something. After winning over West
Virginia in the opener they lost two
hard luck games to Temple and
Georgetown. They will be “up” for
Tuesday night’s game so the Panthers

IPanthers by chopping out a clean-cut  had better be on their toes-

“And did you notice her hair? Just
like a mop.” !,

Babe:
They look just like a big bunch of!
cheats, don’t they? ;

Esther: “That one with the black;
hair is kind of cute though, isn’t he?”1

Babe: “Yes, but I bet he’s just as
big a dead heat as the rest.”

Esther: “There’s the referee blow-
ing the whistle.”

Babe: “Did you notice
dress Myrtle had on today.
it a fright?”

Esther: “There’s that horrid ref-
eree blowing that whistle again.
Every time he does that he cheats
some more for Pitt. You say that he
helped the Dukes that time? Oh, I
didn’t know that!”

A shot rang out. Had some Joe
Penner fan killed Esther? Alas, it
was but the end of the game.

The alleged Pitt News sports
writer walked slowly out of the Sta-
dium. His mind was made up on one
point: Duquesne coeds felt about
Pitt as they did about Gracie’s new
green taffeta.

Engineering Cage Teams

Clash Tonight, Thursday

The annual Engineering association
basketball tournament will reach its
ﬁnal round in a game to be played as
part of the program of the associa-
tion smoker Thursday night at Trees
gym_ Four teams are still in the run-
ning for the championship: the Elec-
tricals, the Industrials, the Civils, and
the Chemicals.

The semiﬁnals will take place at
the gym tonight, when the EE and IE
and the CE and ChE teams clash.
The ﬁrst game is scheduled for 8
o’clock; the second will go on an hour
later.

The IE’s advanced to the semi-ﬁnal
round by means of a forfeit from the
AE’s. The CE’s downed the ME’s in

easy fashion in a ﬁrst round game.

The Irish have one of the greatest
teams in their history and one of the
greatest in the country. By trouncing
Butler Saturday night they extended
their winning streak to 22 consecutive
games, The Panthers will very deﬁ-
nitely be the underdogs in this game.

Pitt-Notre Dame games are always
exciting. One of the greatest games
ever played on the Stadium ﬂoor was
the one between the Irish and the
Panthers in 1931 when Timmy Lawry
scored in the third extra period to
give the local team a victory.

The Boxers

After the ﬁne start made by Coach
Joe Orsini’s boxers Saturday night, it
seems too bad that only one home
match has been scheduled for them
this year, Saturday night was the
ﬁrst and only opportunity for
students to see their boxing team per-
form at home.

If it’s not too late it might not be
amiss to schedule some more matches
to take place at the Stadium.

Incidentally, that ﬁght of Jimmie
Giannatti, piano player extraordinary,
was something to telegraph home
about. His was as nice an exhibition
of boxing as has been seen around
here in quite some time.

Seminar Hears Students

The Thursday afternoon metallurgy
seminar was devoted to student
speeches. Irwin Bower spoke on
“Chromium Plating” and Harry Joyce
discussed “Cadmium Plating.” Both
students are senior metallurgists.

The chairman for the meeting was
Charles Bower, M34.

‘Pitt Men Compete
In Butler Relays

 

500 Expected At Outstanding
Indoor Track Carnival

Representatives from the Pitt track-
and ﬁeld squad will be among those‘
representing approximately 200 col-
leges and universities of the country

Coach Carl Olson plans to send at
least one relay group to the meet and
there is a possibility that several
Pitt individual performers will enter"
in events there also.

, The meet, ofﬁcially known as the
Butler Indoor Relay Carnival, is one
of the outstanding indoor track events-
of the season. The judges, timers,
and starters are required to wear
formal dress, the governor of Indiana
will serve as honorary judge, and 3,
Butler university queen will reign
over the meet, giving the whole affair‘
a decidedly big-time effect.

Last Year the relays drew a total of
361 athletes and that ﬁgure is expect-'
ed to have a substantial increase in
the coming meet.
