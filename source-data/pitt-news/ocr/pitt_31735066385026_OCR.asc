Voter apathy plagues American elections

By Lou Grieco
For The Pitt News

One of the fundamental tasks
of any political campaign is to try
to target special segments of the
population.

While these groups may be
different for different campaigns,
there is one part of the population
that all campaigns must face: the
apathetic.

”I’ve never watched the news
or read the newspaper,” said Lisa
Stimpson, a Pitt sophmore. ”It
wasn't a big influence in my life.
I don't see how I'm affected by
it.” Stimpson said that her parents

.) do not vote, and she does not in-

tend to.

Stimpson’s view is shared by
many Pitt students. When asked
why he doesn't vote, Rick Gul-
den, a Pitt junior, said, ”My one
vote doesn't really matter when
compared with the millions of
people who are voting.”

Advisers
petition
for study
areas

By Karen D. Speece

For The Pitt News

The big test is tomorrow, but
the whole floor has decided to
have a party. Hillman Library
looks and sounds like Wall Street
at high noon. The cafeteria is
closed for the night. Where can
you go for some solitude?

Because of complaints about
the lack of quiet study space at
Pitt, the CAS advisers have decid-
ed to take some action. Last week
at the group advising sessions,
petitions were circulated with the
hope that some change may be
brought about.

The petition stated, ”What lit-
tle space there once was in the
residence halls has been covered
with particle board and convert-
ed into make—shift housing for still
more students. The conditions
which now exist in the residence
halls discourage the academic ac-
tivity which is supposed to be the
raison d’etre of every university.”

The petitions have met with
mixed responses among students
at the group meetings. Some ad-
visers have received only a few
signers, while others have had up
to four pages of response.

Fred Koloc, director of advising
for CAS, said that the advisers
took a tour of the campus and
were ”disturbed with what they

Please see Study, page 3

One group on campus that is
trying to combat voter apathy is
the College Young Democrats,
who have been sponsoring a
voter registration drive. Though
they give out information about
Michael Dukakis at their table,
the organization is registering
people of all parties.

”What surprised me initially
was the large number of un-
registered voters," said Ken
Haber, president of the College
Young Democrats. Haber said
that the results of the drive have
been ’’excellent,’’ registering

over 600 new voters.

Haber said that there are two
main reasons for the large num-
ber of unregistered voters. One is
that many have just turned 18
and haven't thought of registering
yet.

The other reason is that many
students were previously
registered to vote in the 1984
elections, but have not voted
since. If someone doesn't vote for
two years, they must register
again.

However, Haber said,”There
definitely is an apathy ingre-

dient." He said that students
often have to be persuaded to
register because many students
do not know the candidates’ po-
sitions on the issues. Also, many
students don't realize how much
their vote counts until they find

out how close this presidential"

election is. r

Haber feels that voter apathy
among students is dangerous. He
said, ”If change is going to occur
in this country, it will be
spearheaded by college-age
people.”

Building
planned
for Pitt
campus

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
is presently involved in three
major construction and reno-
vation projects, and several
more are slated to begin with-
in the next year, according to
Gordon Bugby, associate
director of planningand en-
gineering for Pitt's Physical
Plant.

Both the Library and Infor-
mation Science Building and
Salk Hall are undergoing
major renovations, and Pitt is
working with Presbyterian-
University and Eye and Ear
Hospitals to complete a nine-
floor biomedical science tow-
er on top of the Presby park-
ing garage near Pitt Stadium.

Bugby said the renovation of
the LIS Building is "99 percent
complete.” The renovations
were made to accommodate
the University Center for In-
structional Resources and the
Telecommunications office.

The $18 million cost of up-
grading Pitt's dental school in
Salk Hall is being entirely
funded by the state, Bugby
said. The renovations, which
are approximately one-third
complete, include new dental
chairs in the laboratories and
some new offices.

Caroline Collins, assistant
director of the university's
Health Sciences News Bureau,
said the biomedical science
tower is the first phase of a
planned $280 million Partner-
ship for Medical Renaissance
expansion project.

The tower itself will cost
$60 million to construct and is
expected to be completed in
1990, Collins said.

Pitt has contributed approx-
imately one-third of the ex-
pense, according to Bugby.

Collis said the remaining
costs have been met by private
contributions and gifts from
foundations.

At a ceremony marking the
beginning of the tower’s con-
struction on June 20, Pitt Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar stated the
building would be a ”tangible
symbol of the university's
commitment to maintain its
place as one of the nation's
leading biomedical research
centers  in this tower, some

At least one dead in elementary school shooting

GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) ~ A
gunman entered an elementary
school yesterday and opened fi re
with a pistol, killing one pupil,
authorities said.

Ten injured people were taken
to "Self Memorial Hospital in
Greenwood, said a spokeswom-
an at the hospital. The gunman
was apprehended and is now in
custody, authorities at the scene
said.

”We have 10 patients that have
been brought in through the
emergency room, two teachers
and eight children,” said spokes-
woman Rosemary Mountz.

No minimum wage
increase this year

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate
Democrats said Monday that
Republicans have effectively
killed chances of raising the
$3.35 minimum wage this year
through a five-day filibuster.

The bill by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., would have
raised the wage floor, which has
been at its present level since
1981, to $3.75 in January, $4.15
in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.

Kennedy said it would have
directly benefited some 15 mil-
lion workers now paid less than

Senate Democrats had attempt-
ed twice, the last time on Friday,
to invoke closure to end the
filibuster. Both attempts failed.

Reagan speaks at
United Nations

UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
President Reagan told the United
Nations in a farewell speech
Monday that this was ”a moment
of hope” for peace in the world
and that a new U.S.—Soviet treaty

to sharply reduce nuclear arms

may be concluded next year.

He called for an international
war on drug traffickers, terrorism
and hostage—taking, and vowed to
maintain U.S. support for an
armed insurgency against the
leftist government of Nicaragua.

Koloc added, ”|t’s not a brand-

immunology and pharmacol-
ogy will usher medical science
into the next century.”
Bugby said the university
will begin work in November
Q on a $5 million water facility
on the hill above the fraterni-
ty houses. The project is en-
tirely university-funded.
Bugby said two projects
funded by the Pennsylvania
state government are sched-
uled to begin sometime next
year. Construction of Pitt's bio-
technical manufacturing
center will begin in June on
the east portion of the former
Jones and Laughlin steel mill
near the Monongahela River.
The site is shared by Pitt and

. Carnegie Mellon University.

Bugby said the $12 million
building will be the first in a
series of high-technology
centers built on the site by
both universities.

He added that the state has
also approved funds for a
multi-purpose building to be
built between Oakland
Avenue and Bouquet Street
below Forbes Avenue. The

. structure is currently being

designed by state architects.

Two more nationality rooms
for the Cathedral of Learning
are also being designed. Bug-
by said enough funds have
been secured to begin plans
for the construction of African
and Ukrainian classrooms.

By 1991, the universitygalso
~ hopes to complete a $3 mil-
lion indoor sports facility on
top of a new parking garage
being built on Robinson Street
for Presbyterian—University
Hospital. Bugby said the
center will include a track, a
practice football field and ten-
nis courts.

In addition,.the university
has awarded a $100,000 con-
tract to consulting firm Sasaki
and Associates to study the
physical needs of the campus
and evaluate the feasibility of
projects tentatively planned
for the future. These include a
new dormitory on the hill
above Pitt Stadium, renovation
of the Bellefield Annex and
renovation and expansion of
Alumni Hall and the Chemis-
try Building.

Lack of interest in
science dangerous

In a recentreport by the National Assessment of Educa-
tional Progress, it was said that our nation's children are
”remarkably limited” in their comprehension of science and

‘apparently have no desire to improve upon it.

The report said that most third-grade teachers spend two
hours or less each week teaching science; most students in

the seventh and 11th grades spend two hours or less each I

week on science homework; and only 7 percent of the
I7—year—olds in the study were ready to do college-level work

in science.

In an age where the sciences of physics, chemistry and
biology are becoming more and more important, it is dis-
turbing that the people they will have the most effect on are
uninterested in them. The space shuttle Discovery, which
is set-to launch soon, would not even exist if it weren't for
the great advances made in physics.

The responsiblity lies in our educational system, and in
ourselves, to try to correct this alarming problem. But the
question that must be addressed is: Why are students unin-

terested in science?

The answer does not seem to be immediately apparent.
Another study of the reasons why young students are losing
interest in science is needed to help figure out the solution.
Apathy for science is dangerous to a country that relies heav-

effective action is needed.

Begging: aprofitable business for some

-for you), I was now skeptical and

New York City Mayor Ed Koch
recently proclaimed that New
York City citizens should no
longer give money to beggars on
the street who ask for spare
change. Koch believes that many
of these beggars use this money
to buy drugs and alcohol. Koch
also /believes that some of these
beggars make a good deal of
money at this trade. Also, he feels
that if these homeless people
have time to beg, they also have
time to find a job. Koch con-
cludes that if citizens no longer
give to beggars, the beggar
problem will go away. I

Many people believe that other
cities, including Pittsburgh,

‘ should follow the example that

Koch is trying to set. These
proclamations have caused a na-
tionwide controversy over
whether we should or should not
help out the people who are less
fortunate than ourselves, and
who are forced to ask us, the
more fortunate, for a little of our
help. .

Actually, the problem is a little
more extensive than less for-
tunate people asking the more
fortunate people for a little help.
What it is starting to come down
to is the fact that begging is start-

'ily on the benefits of the various sciences, and quick and

ing to become a growing and
profitable business for some of
the ”less fortunate.”

It's no secret that there have
been beggars who are really con
men and have been ripping us off
for years. In the movie Trading
Places, starring Eddie Murphy
and Dan Akroyd, Murphy plays
a character who pretends that he
is a crippled Vietnam veteran and
begs for money. He is exposed in
the movie as being a con man
who is not crippled. Murphy
gives one of those cocky, famous
smiles, and all is harmonious.

Even though he is a fictitious
character, it is no longer funny

On Thursday of this week, the
space shuttle Discovery is set to
lift off from Cape Canaveral. The
anticipation of the long—awaited
return of Americans to space has
grown to fever pitch. Scientists,
reporters and interested individu-
als wait breathlessly for the
launch.

Why? .

Not why, in the sense of why
should people care about the
launch, but why do we care
about space?

I can't say that I’m not glad we
have explored space. Without it,
how could I watch Bob Costas
reporting the Olympics from
Seoul?

I just don't see the point in
wasting money, energy and un-
fortunate lives all in the pursuit of
knowledge about space.

Benefits of walking the fence.

Almosteveryone is predicting
a very close presidential election
result, maybe 48 percent for Bush
and 48 percent for Dukakis, with
the remaining Reagan Democrats
deciding the outcome.

With this in mind, both sides

are trying to win over the un-
decided voters.

Freddy Dumstart, who is listed
in both the Dukakis and Bush
computers as one of the key
”don’t know” voters, is therefore
receiving tremendous attention
from each camp.

' Three of Dukakis’ people
called on Dumstart the other day.

”What do you want with me?”
Freddy asked.

”We are appealing to all the
Reagan Democrats to come
home,” one of the Dukakis men
said. ”We wish you to know how

when you realize that this type of
thing goes on everyday. Shame-
fully enough, it is this type of de-
ception by people who are,
quoting Koch, ”just too darn lazy
to get a job,” that makes all of the
homeless seem unneedy and dis-

- honest.

If you have read Newsweek
lately or have seen some articles
on the homeless in The New
York Times, you have probably
come across a few examples of
con men beggars. These thieves
infiltrate many other cities be-
sides New York. One city that I
know of personally is Pittsburgh.

One example that I know of is
a young man who once asked me
for a dollar so that he could buy
something to eat. He was very ag-
gressive in his approach, an ex-
cellent speaker, and visibly

intoxicated. Instead of handing I

him some dough, I offered to buy
him a hamburger. He didn't seem
to be too interested in this offer.
”I would just like a dollar. I'll buy
something a little cheaper to eat
later on.”

cheaper than a hamburger and

ic waste, which is free at any

What's the fuss about space?

SCOT
ROSS

In our own country there are an
estimated 3.5 million homeless
citizens and with one small part
of the funds we uselessly pump
into making sure we can get the
best photos of the dark side of the
moon, there would undoubtedly
be a significant lessening of the
number of children who go to
sleep hungry each and every
night. '

However, the space program
does employ thousands of peo-

ple, and to cut them off is as lu-_

dicrous a move as any. It has to
end somewhere, though.

I can't honestly say that space
isn't interesting, and it would be

personally mean to the governor
and his clear wife, Kitty.”
”That’s nice to hear, but I still
haven't made up my mind about
whom I'm going to vote for,”
Dumstart said.
”Can the governor take you to

, dinner at an extremely good eth-

nic restaurant and explain his po-
sition on agricultural price
supports?” ~

”I have already eaten at a good
ethnic restaurant with the Bush
people and am not really interest-
ed in that particular issue.”

”Then maybe you would like

‘ to attend a night football game in

Texas with Lloyd Bentsen while
he tells you what a squirt Sen.
Quayle really is. Fred, we want
you on our team now.”
”You’re barking up the wrong
tree, gentlemen. I am not going
to make up my mind this early in

. the game.”

”Why not?” _

”Because as soon as I an-
nounce how I intend to vote, no
one will take me to dinner any-

said, ’’I only have a ten."

. Thinking that I had won the ar-
gument and had convinced him
to join me for a hamburger, I was
surprised when he proved me
wrong by reaching into his pock-
et, pulling out some money, and
offering me change.

Another example is that of a
very clever man whom I call
“The Executive Beggar.” He is a
very clean, articulate young man
dressed in a nice and new three-
piece suit. In his hand he carries
a large legal briefcase, under his
arm there is sometimes The Wall
Street /ournal. There is only one
problem with this young man.
Everyday I see him, he seems to
have lost his wallet and needs a
dollar for the bus home. ” Could
you please give me a dollar?”

The first time he asked me, I
was more than sympathetic. The
second time he asked me, I didn't
have a dollar and could have
sworn that he had asked me just
last week. The third ' time he
asked me, about two months
later, I was just a little suspicious.

When I decided to write this ar-
ticle, I thought that I would find
him and either interview or fol-
low him. First, I thought, I will fol-

wonderful if we could find out
what is in the heavens. But the
unfeasibility of this endeavor is
apparent.

Since the Cold War of the '50s,
Americans have been pro-
grammed to believe that we will
fall prey to Communist rule if we
fall behind in the space race.

I think that in the past, as well
as today, our leaders did this to
engender a sense of need for
them through our own fears.

I can understand the pursuit of
knowledge in the ‘face of the
unknown compelling men and
women to the forefront‘ of the
universe in these circumstances.

It's just that we are caught in a
vicious c_irc|e of money and
propaganda, and somewhere, the
wasteful spending and risk has to
diminish, that's all.

more. Look at the millions of

voters already lined up for
Dukakis. You know that you have
them in your pocket, so you don't
even care if they exist or not.”

One of Dukakis’ people said, ”I
think you exaggerate your own
importance. We couldn't care
less if you voted for our candidate
or not. How would you like to be
Secretary of the Treasury?”

Freddy answered, ”The Bush
people offered me head of the
CIA.”

”They have no intention of
delivering on that, Mr. Dumstart.

”I’l| give you my answer on
Election Day.”

’’It may be too late. We're
holding a seat on the Supreme
Court for you, but if you don't de-
cide right away we'll have to

Looking like a lawyer, he stops
other professional people and
beckons them with the same plea
that he gave to yours truly. Also,

_he asks a lot of women. And be-

man, the women have their
purses out in record—breaking
times. In the half hour that I fol-

about twenty bucks.

Led by tournament MVP
Denise Frawley, the Pitt women's
volleyball team swept through
the competition this past
weekend to captu re the West Vir-

-ginia Classic.

Friday evening, the Lady Pan-
thers faced a Drexel team that
gave them more of a match than
expected. Even so, Pitt was able
to take the match in three straight
games. The scores were 15-9,
15-5 and 15-8.

  SPORTS

Keying the win were superla-
tive defensive efforts by Kelly
Matheis and Lori Silk. Matheis
registered 15 digs while Silk tal-
lied 13.

Janelle Lantagne led the Lady
Panthers on offense with seven
kills. Denise Frawley, nursing an
injury, saw limited action for Pitt.

On Saturday afternoon, the
Lady Panthers challenged the
Lady Sycamores of Indiana State.

Despite wholesale substitutions .

by interim coach Sue Hoover, Pitt
romped in three straight games
(15-4, 15-13 and 15-9).

Outstanding performances by
Frawley, Matheis, Lantagne and
Nora Mulvihill keyed the Lady
Panthers to the victory. 1

Playing in only two games,
Frawley displayed her versatility
in tallying seven kills and 12 digs.

In the Pitt defensive scheme,
Matheis and Lantagne led the
way with 17 and 13 digs, respec-
tively.

The West Virginia Moun-
taineers have had a bevy of
fine college quarterbacks in re-
cent years.

Oliver Luck played for
WVU from 1978-1981. Luck
holds down the No. 1 spot for
passing yards (6,282) and
passing touchdowns (43) in
the Mountaineers’ record
book. Following his senior
season, Luck was drafted in
the second round by the
Houston Oilers.

Next came Jeff Hostetler
from 1982-1983. He is fifth on
the all-time passing list with
4,261 yards and 26 TDs.
Hostetler was taken in the
third round by the New York
Giants in 1984 and is their
third-string quarterback and
sometime wide receiver.

In 1985, Jeff Timko took the
helm. Timko is 10th on the
passing list with 1,857 yards
and 12 scoring tosses. He was
not drafted by the NFL.

Now, redshirt sophomore
Major Harris is at the helm. He
just might be the best of the
group.

Last season, Harris was
named the freshman quarter-
back of the year by The Sport-
ing News. He set WVU
freshman records in rushing
(615 yards on 143 carries),
passing (79 completions on
155 attempts for 1,200 yards)
and total offense (1,815 yards).

”Major makes my job so
much easier,” WVU running
back Anthony Brown said. ”A
lot of teams are scared of
Major, and they try to shut him

down. When they try to shut

WVU’s success is

opens up. He adds so much to
our team.” V «

Harris took over the full-
time quarterbacking job last
season, and WVU is 10-6 (in-
cluding a 4-0 record this sea-
son) and has scored 490 points
in that time) span.

”We just love him down
here,” Mountaineer coach
Don Nehlen said. ”He can do
so many things for us.”

Harris is a native of Pitts-
burgh and a graduate of —
Brashear High School. As a 1
high school senior in 1985, he
was listed in The Sporting
News top 100. He was also
selected as Pittsburgh's player
of the year, all-state and all- ,
conference.

Harris returned home this
past Saturday to guide the
Mountaineers over the Pan-
thers, 31-10, and to prove to
critics that WVU’s weak
schedule was not the sign of
a weak team. 1

”|t’was a homecoming o
sorts for me,” Harris said. ’’It
feels good. I still get a lot of
support from the people in the
area. I'm just glad we were
able to hang in there and get
the win like we did.”

Prior to Saturday's game,
Harris was averaging 135

1 yards passing and 49 yards
rushing per game. Against Pitt,
Harris was a little below these
totals, throwing for 61 yards
and gaining 45 on the ground.

Even though he wasn't up to
his normal standards, Harris
still kept the Pitt defense off-
balance all day and controlled
the tempo for both teams.

”Major Harris is, without a
doubt, a great athlete,” Pitt

coach Mike Gottfried said.
”He made some really big
plays against us. I was very im-
pressed with how he runs their
offense."

’’I was most impressed with
Major's scrambling ability,”
Pitt free safety Troy Washing-
ton said. ”He is a very good
athlete. We knew that he was
going to do a lot of running
around [in the backfield].

’’I remember watching him

in high school, and I knew that
he was going to be a good
one. You can't take anything
away from the rest of their
players, but Major is a very
good football player,” added
Washington, a graduate of
nearby Duquesne High
School.

Even with all of his success,
Harris gives much of the credit
to his teammates.

PANTHER NOTES: The OC-

Dame has officially been
moved to a 4:00 national tel-

Panther soccer team climbs to .500 mark    

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

The Panther soccer team
brought their season record to 2-2
with a 2-1 victory at Ohio State
on Sunday following a 3-1 loss to
West Virginia last Wednesday.

The Ohio State game was
characterized by sloppy play on
the part of both teams. Sopho-
more halfback Ivan Amayo said,

’’It was like playing kickball for
45 minutes.’f,

Ohio State scored early in the
second half to take a 1-0 lead.
The Panthers shifted into high
gear after the score and started to
play controlled soccer. They
played a much more organized
game and came up with two
goals.

Midfielder Heinz Pak scored
his second goal of the season on

a cross to tie the game at 1-1.
Shortly thereafter, striker Chris
Riding scored on a head ball wi-
thin the first minute he set foot on
the field. _

Most important for Pitt was the
development of the offense and
the fact that the team capitalized
on opportunities that they creat-
ed. The offense has been produc-
ing scoring opportunities all-
season but has had trouble put-

ting the ball past opposing
goaltenders.

The Panthers put some intense
pressure on OSU’s defense and
came away winners. The offen-
sive line seems to be progressing
nicely in terms of goal production
and overall confidence. The team
is playing the entire field effec-
tively, and Coach Joe Lux-
bacher’s squad is optimistic
about the remainder of their

season.
The loss to West Virginia ex-
tended the Mountaineer domina-

tion over Pitt to 13 straight years.

The game was éxtremely phys-

» ical on the part of both teams, but

WVU proved to be too much for
the Panthers.

Those surprising Bengals just keep winning

Just a few pieces left over from
a sports weekend:

0 The ’most ridiculous game of
the young NFL season was
played Sunday. The Indianapolis
Colts defeated the Miami Dol-
phins 15-13 on the strength of
five Dean Biasucci field goals.

First of all, this doesn't put the
Dolphins in a good light. Here is
a team that is supposed to have
an explosive offense, capable of
putting points on the board at any

just dead fish on a football field.

The Colts, on the other hand,
should be embarassed to call this
a win. Neither team should have
shown up at the park.

0 It serves the Washington Red-
skins right: They make Jay
Schroeder unhappy by naming
Doug Williams the starter at the
beginning of the season. They
then trade Schroeder away to the
Raiders. Williams has to have an
emergency appendectomy and is

 

expected to miss several weeks,
if not the whole season. They are
then forced to start two-year pro

given time, and they couldn't
beat a team that only kicked field
goals. Maybe the Dolphins are

Redskins taking back-to-back
championships.

0 Well, the Bengals are now
4-0. Last season, they went 4-11
and finished dead last in the AFC
Central. They weren't expected
to do much better this season.

This week, they beat the
Cleveland Browns 24-1 7. Last
season, Cleveland went 10-5 and
made it all the way to the AFC
championship. This season, they
were expected to win everything.
Instead, they stand at 2-2. Is this
great or what? Wake me up when
it's over.

0 Canadian Olympic runner
Ben Johnson ran the most amaz-
ing race anyone will ever see.
The lOO—meter final was billed as
a duel between Johnson and
American Carl Lewis. As it turned
out, Johnson absolutely blew the
rest of the field away, running a
9.79 —- a world record that will
never be broken.

Unfortunately, Johnson was
stripped of his title after testing
positive for steroids. Another sad
‘chapter in the world of sports.
Why don't these athletes wise
up?

0 Former Pitt star Roger King-
dom also made big news at the
Olympics. Kingdom won the
110-meter high hurdles in the
amazing time of 12.98 seconds.
There have been only three run-
ners to run this race in under 13
seconds, and Kingdom has done
it twice.

0 The Boston Red Sox looked
damn good Saturday. That is, un-
til the last inning. They summed
up their whole existence in that
one inning. Leading by one run,
stopper Lee Smith walked Ricky
Henderson, who immediately
stole second. Henderson went to
third on a wild pitch and was
sacrificed home by Dave
Winfield.

Smith then loaded the bases
with two outs and Willie Ran-
dolph at the plate. Randolph hit
a slow grounder to Bosox short-
stop Spike Owen, who fell down
and kicked the ball away. The er-
ror Iet the winning run score.

0 Oh yeah! Darell Waltrip won
his second straight Goody’s 500.
After trailing the last 79 laps, Alan
Kulwicki managed to finish only
5.2 seconds behind Waltrip.
Now that's exciting.

dricks on a head ball by forward
Wayne Morgan.

Later in the first half, Pitt stop-
per John Ascher tripped WVU
forward Andy Bell deep inside
Pitt's 18. Keating scored unassist-
ed on the resulting penalty kick
to make the score 2-0.

About six minutes later, WVU
center midfielder Joe Deehan
crossed the ball from deep in the
corner, and stopper Scott Laramie
put a short touch shot in the net
for WVU’s final goal.

Pitt's lone score came with less
than seven minutes remaining in
the game on a 20-yard blast from
forward Heinz Pak, toasting
WVU goalie Mark Bachteler. Pak
scored on a break—away, as the
shot landed in the upper left—hand
corner of the net.

Both teams played physical,

‘ kick-and-run soccer and took

numerous long shots. Pitt failed
to take advantage of three crucial
scoring opportunities. Senior for-
ward Jeff Vargas was tripped up
inside the West Virginia 18 by
sweeper C.C. Chandler, who was
the only obstacle in front of the
goal.

Freshman striker Mike Laus at-
tempted a touch pass to Pak,
again inside the 18, but was
stuffed by goalie Bachteler, who
played aggressively and came
charging out from the box. Late
in the second half, Laus again
missed a break—away scoring op-
portunity at the 12-yard line as a
result of Bachteler’s aggressive

play.

Stopper Ascher feels that his
team must take advantage of the
opportunities they create. ”We’re
missing a lot of great chances,
and we've got to start scoring,”
he said.

Despite the loss, Pitt coach Joe
Luxbacher was extremely pleased
with Laus’ play, in particular, the
fact that he hustled to create the
break-away opportunities.

”He [Laus] worked hard the
whole game. He took the ball
and createdthe chances — we
just didn't capitalize," Luxbacher
said.

Laus admitted that inex-
perience may have been a factor
contributing to his missed scoring
opportunities, considering WVU
was his first collegiate game.

Sweeper Dan Liberati, who set
up a lot of offensive opportunities
with his accurate kicks into
WVU’s half of the field, was dis-
appointed with the Panthers’

. defensive play.

’’In the back, we didn't play
nearly as well as we should have.
Defensively, this game was [as
different as] night and clay com-
pared to Bucknell. We let them
have their way. Instead of taking
our game to them, we let them
take their game to us. None of
their goals were pretty. They
were all a result of our mistakes,”
Liberati said.

Luxbacher agreed. ”We let up
two horrible goals on stuff we've

talked about all week. The first A

goal should have been pushed
out. [On] the third goal, the ball
should not have bounced around
so much.” I

well against West Virginia. She
knew the scouting report really
well. She knew that West Vir-
ginia’s middle blockers were
slow and [she] ran the offense ac-
cordingly to take advantage of it,”
noted Hoover.

Making all-tournament for Pitt
were tourney MVP Frawley as
well as Lantagne and Mulvihill.

Earlier last week, the Lady Pan-
thers swept aside the Colonials of
Robert Morris in three games by
scores of 15-12, 15-9 and 15-8.

Pitt did not play its finest
volleyball of the seasonin win-
ning, but Hoover thought the
Wednesda niht ame was im-

 

  

portant nonetheless.

”After coaching the girls in
practice for a week and a half, it
was the first game where I was
the head coach. It was an impor-
tant dress rehearsal for the West
Virginia tournament. We had a
few wrinkles to iron out, and I
think we did it there,” she said.

With Frawley out with a bad
back, Silk filled in at the outside
hitter position and played an in-
tegral role in the Lady Panther’s
win.

”Lori kept the team motivated ‘

throughout the match. Her con-
fidence in the team pulled it all
toether,” reflected Hoover.

The Lady Panthers are 4-0 dur-
ing Hoover's interim coaching
stint. They have swept by the
likes of Robert Morris, Drexel, In-
diana State and West Virginia.

Not only have they been win-
ning, but they are improving in
each and every match. Last week
started with a tougher match than
expected from Robert Morris and
culminated with a fine win over
a tough West Virginia squad.

Hoover had nothing but praise
for her charges after this
weekend: ”The girls had a great
match against West Virginia.
They are definitely getting
better.”

Different types of people add to
experience of running Great Race

It was already 8:20 a.m. when
I left the apartment and began
running to the starting line of the
Great Race.

I overslept and was running
way behind schedule. Since liv-
ing in .Oakland, I've always
jogged to the starting line, which
is three miles away (Frick Park in
Squirrel Hill).

I hadn't been running much
and had experienced some leg
problems the night before, but I
didn't experience any pain on the
way up. I had a bad feeling about
running that day. It was cloudy
andlooked like it was going to
rain just as it did Saturday night.

I have to admit, I had negative
feelings about the race. I
registered late, which meant pay-
ing $15 to run a race I was not
prepared to run. The entry form
mentioned roads being closed for

just a certain amount of time, so
it would be best if you ran 12
minutes or less per mile.

The whole idea of the race

SAM
TALLARICO

when the late Mayor Richard
Caliguiri started it in 1977 was to
encourage Pittsburghers to come
out, socialize and have fun while
getting a little exercise. It
wouldn't hurt if they blocked the
roads a little longer for people

‘who like to walk the race.

Anyway, I was upset because
I felt the race was losing its pur-
pose. Then, as I got closer to the
start, I watched some of the other
runners and realized that the var-

- iety of people still made this race

special.

Over 12,000 people (which
makes this race one of the largest
10K races), all with different
styles, make it special.

As I got closer to the start, per-
sonalities began to show. Ten
minutes before the race, a few
runners drank some beers. A
group of runners put on Hal-
loween masks, while some cou-
ples were determined to hold
hands through the race.

After I found a small opening
at the start, I overheard two men,
ages 49 and 42, talking about
running. Both began running
about a year—and—a—half ago and
were enjoying it. One man said
to the other that his wife stopped
taking high blood pressure pills
because running has helped her
considerably.

The race was about to begin,
but this year was different. This
was my seventh Great Race, but
it was the first time Caliguiri was
not there to wish the runners

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, September 27,

well. Mayor Sophie Masloff was
there, but with all due respect, it
wasn't the same..

The race was underway, but
because of the size of the crowd,
I didn't cross the actual starting
line until the race clock had
passed the 3:30 mark, while
some people didn't hit it until
eight minutes or more.

After leaving Beechwood
Boulevard, Forbes Avenue soon
became flooded with runners and
supporters. As opposed to smaller
races. where most of the compe-
titors strive to do well and even
place well, the Great Race had
lots of talking, joke-telling and the
like.

There were still a lot of charac-
ters out there on the road, in-

’ cluding:

0 A runner blowing a bugle,
wearing running shorts, but wear-
ing a shirt and hat similar to those
seen on F—Troop.

0 A couple who ran with shirts
stating they were ”just married”
the day before.

0 Two men, in different places,
each pushing strollers with babies
in them, while one woman had
her child behind her back.

The course, after leaving Squir-
rel Hill, then enters Oakland. Still
on Forbes, it drops past Carnegie
Mellon, then turns onto Fifth
Avenue, which takes it past the

/Pitt campus.

Litchfield Towers mark the
three—mi|e point, and there was a
lot of vocal support for the run-
ners, especially from students
who had friends running the race.

It was around the Litchfield
Towers that I caught up to the first
wheelchair participant (wheel-
chair racers are given a
15-minute headstart). Runners ap-
plaud and give support to wheel-
chair racers as they pass. It takes
a lot of heart and determination,
as well as strength, to wheel one-
self through a 10K race. Seeing
that makes you appreciate the
fact you're running on two legs.
It always gives me an emotional
lift, so I return the favor by join-
ing in on the cheering.

After turning left on Craft
Avenue, you take the next right
onto Forbes, then hit the
Boulevard of the Allies.

This is perhaps the most criti-
cal part of the race. It stretches

over a mile and has a small in-
cline around the 4‘/2-mile mark.
This has always been a weak spot
for me. The three-mile run to the
start took its toll here, but I didn't
give in (like I did the past two
years). You can hear the other
runners still make light of the sit-
uation, but inside, it can really
hurt you.

Still on the Boulevard, it comes
into the downtown area. The
sidewalks are once again flood-
ed, just as they were on Forbes.
It's always nice to hear people
cheering you, which could ex-

plain why runners pick up the
pace when they reach the down-
town area.

The downtown area has the
third water stop for thirsty run-
ners, but |_aIways pass them all.
Drinking water during the race
has a way of distracting me and
gives me stomach cramps, but for
others, it's a welcome sight.

On the right side of the road,
I always take notice of the Ameri-
can Red Cross building, which
gives me ideas of running in as
a casualty.

A kid flew by me in that area,
probably around eight or nine

CLASSIFIEDS

years old, and got 15 high—fives
by friends and family on the side-
walk. With less than a quarter of
a mile to go, seeing that kid run
by like that makes you feel a lit-
tle older than you really are.

With the help of the crowd, I
turned the corner and pushed
myself into Point State Park. I ac-
tually felt good — physically and
mentally — because I hadn't run
as much as I would have liked in
the last few months.

I watched as more people
finished, and others greeted them
as they crossed. Runners sought
after the post-race refreshments

and exchanged stories of how
they performed.

Are Nakkim of Boston and Bet-
ty Geiger of Raleigh, N.C. were
the first male and female runners
to cross, but Eric Wilkins and Su-

san Wagner were the first Pitts- .

burghers to cross, so they were
recipients of the Richard S.
Caliguiri Award, in honor of the
late mayor.

Last year at the starting line,
Caliguiri wished the runners well.
He said that one day he would
have to come out and run the
race, ”one of these days.”
