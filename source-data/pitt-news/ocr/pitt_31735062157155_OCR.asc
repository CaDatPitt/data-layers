" FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1948

Dr. John G. Bowman

Two Men Ineligible,
One Refuses to Run

Men’s elections both clariﬁed

and became more muddled Wed-

nesday afternoon with announcements from George Lynn, president
of Student Congressand Ray Pluskey, president of the newly orga-
nized Pitt Independent Association.

-Lynn threw a large sized confusion factor into the elections

'procedure by issuing the information that Bob Silberstein and James

Onderka, junior nominees for Congress, are ineligible because of
i A

credit requirements. v

Silberstein, previously designat-
ed a sophomore by the Nomina-
tions Committee, will not have
sufﬁcient credits at the end of the
spring term to fulﬁll, the constitu-
tional requirement.

Onderka, on the other side of
the ledger, has too many credits
to enter the junior race.

Bob Vogelsang and Bill Brehm
move into the slots vacated - by
Silberstein and Onderka.

Further confusion resulted with
a statement by Gene Thrasher, an-
other senior candidate, that he
would not accept the nomination.

His’ withdrawal would place
Don McCormack into the Con-
gressional senior fray. ‘

Ray Pluskey, president of PIA,
brought forth the first political of-
ferings of-the race by placing be-
fore the student body the slate and
platform of Pitt independents.

_ The Student Congress slate in-
cludes Paul Fullmer, Education

senior; Don McCormaak, College

senior and copy editor of the Pitt

News; Stuart Workmaster, Col-
lege ‘senior, ex-president of the
Pitt Veterans Association and
present publicity leader for the
Panther and the Owl; and Ray
Pluskey, College senior.

For juniors, PIA proposes Bill
Bruno, Education junior and
member of the football team;
Lynn Dwyer, College; and Dexter
Robinson, College.

The independents’ platform,
passed on by the group at Wed-
ne_sday‘s meeting, calls for action
on the proposed Student Union; a
clear cut athletic policy designed
to produce winning teams; ex-
panded extra—curricular educa-
tional activities (including politi-
cal speakers): more democracy in
Student Government and greater
student voice in University policy;
provision" for a men’s recreation
ﬂoor; and passage of the proposed
revision of Congress-By-Laws.

Students Ask‘

For Memorial    

To Sutherland

Student Congress nudged the
mourning Pittsburgh sport world
into constructive activity Tuesday
by taking the ﬁrst steps toward
establishing a memorial in honor
of the late Dr. John B. Sutherland.

Directed into action by a motion
from Frank Blackstone, Congress
wound up a dramatic session with
a resolution to “take the lead in
a drive to honor Dr. Sutherland
with a memorial, preferably a
ﬁeld house that isnow under con-
sideration for Pitt.”

Plan Field House

Among Chancellor . Fitzgerald's
building plans, the construction,

of a ﬁeld house is known to be
one of the major goals.

Congress does not expect to. do
the whole job, described by T.
W. Biddle, dean of men, as a
“million dollar project,” with
funds solicited from the student
body; tentative plans, however,
count on a significant contribution
from the student body.

A special memorial fund com-
mittee was set up with Bob Dickey
as chairman to study the problem
of student contributions further
and propose recommendations.

Building a ﬁeld house was not
the only idea for a Sutherland
memorial advanced in Congress.

Bob Ingr_im adovcated honoring
Sutherland ’with adequate hous-
ing for students, some of whom
he saw living in‘ “ratholes” to-
day. .
Rename Stadium?

Gene Thrasher wanted to re-
name Pitt ‘Stadium the “Jock
Sutherland Stadium.” _

Frank Blackstone pointed out
that in its present run—down con-
dition the Pitt Stadium would not
be an honor‘ to anyone’s name.

The Memorial Fund commit-
tee, consisting of Chairman Bob
Dickey and Congress members Bill
Fisher, Abbey Clarke, and Gene
Thrasher, desires to contact all
interested students and organiza-
tions in an attempt to consider all
aspects of the problem.

Festival Chiefs Meet

Spring Festival committee
meeting will be held today at
12:30 p. m. in the eighth ﬂoor
office. Chairmen, Busin ess
Managers and Publicity Direc-_
tors of all Festival events are
required to attend.

Real Trouble

Some wag, after reading "the text of the
oﬁcial trustees report released last Monday,
asked for an abrupt change in plans for ﬁn-
ishing off the Cathedral. “Hereafter,” he said,
“all walls will be whitewashed-—it"s in line
with ‘University Policy. "’

Whatever the average person. around cam-
pus, or around town, might think of the stand
the University has taken on this vital athletic
issue is of no importance. After all, the little,
insignificant‘ citizen of Pittsburgh or student
of the University only pays the way.‘

This little man provides. the backing for
Pitt football teams when he buysa set of tick-
ets or pays his tuition. He is inconsequential.

It seems a crime that a unit so large, so
cosmopolitan in -nature, as the University of
Pittsburgh fails to see the importance of good
relations. It is a certainty that Pitt does not
see this; -the attitude of the administration, re-
lations with the city newspapers, lack of con-
cern for alumni ties provide proof for our
statements. .

The real trouble of good relations lies not
in the committees who have met, and discussed
the matter athletics-a-la-Pitt. They have rec-
ommended improved relations. It lies in failure
of many prominent persons to realize their

_ position in the City as well as the University.

All too often, the report comes into this of-
ﬁce that Pitt doesn’t give a damn about what
the public thinks. Can the University expect.
any better than a. bad name for Pitt in its
very own city? I

A more farireaching effect of this foot-
ball fracas might be a realization of the little
man. A bit of extended relations—-good’ press
agent stuﬂ:'-that might prove Pitt does give
a damn for the public, and, consequently, for
itself.

Music
Notes
Jerry Newberg

What. might easily be termed a “new look” in
music will be the delectable fare for those at-
tending the Ellsworth Center dance‘ this evening

at the Hotel Henry. The new 12-piege band of
Wes Parker, .with its distinct symphonic sound.
will be introduced to Pitt students for the first
time. '
Besides the standard brasses, reeds, and
rhythm, it features the rich tones of the ﬂute,
oboe, violin, French horn, and bass clarinet.
The entire setup, makes for smooth dancing
and its deﬁnitely something new for locals.
The band will be graced by the ﬁne pianistics
of Will Hansen, Cap and Gowner, while the. bal-
lads and clever novelties will be voiced by Shelley
Morrow, also a Cap and Gown artist.

, The arrangements, including the old standbys
as well as the new tunes, were perfected by Don
Harris formerly with Max Adkins.
Opening at the Club Copa Monday, April
19, will be Bob Eberly who we ‘all remember
as one-time vocalist with the famed Jimmy
Dorsey. Who can possibly forget the many hit
tunes introduced by Bob when he was team-
ed with Helen 0’Connell and the old J. D.
Band. Remember “Green Eyes”-i-Bob 0118118
with that dreamy voice, then the tempo
changes and in comes the vivacious vocal styl-
ings of that 0’Connell girl. Ahhhh great. Fin-
ishing her engagement at the Copa. is that
“Rockin’ Chair Lady” Mildred Bailey.

Sarah Vaughn, the nation’s greatest new sing-
ing star and winner of all major popularity polls

By Pat‘ Segor and Bob Silbersfeiné—"-—-

Pitt’s Independent Association moves into the  at
8:30 p. in. tomorrow to play host to the student body -at the
ﬁrst big PIA social event of the season. The PIA ‘Cotton Jubilee
is not solely for members of the GDI ’organization . . . it’s" open
to you all. A mere 65 cents admits Greeks, too. ». _

Ironically, the ‘PIA orchestra for the night is headed by
Don Sherill, a Lambda Chi. Fraternity men attending "may

truncheons and other fraternity,
mutilators will be left at home.
Chi Omega women celebrated
Founder's Day at the University
Club last Saturday with the alums.
Both local chapters were present.
The Chi O’s are having their
share of tea dances, too. Last Mon-
day afternoon the girls entertain-
ed the Phi Gams. In the evening
they moved into the Phi Delt
house for more dancing.

This duo of scribes is pleased to
announce the addition of another
frat house on campus. This time
it’s the Alpha Phi Alpha’s who
trade their reserved benches in
Schenley Park for a cozy shelter
at 3046 Center Avenue. The new-
ly acquired abode will open offi-
cially after renovations are com-
pleted.

Question of the season in 'the
APA circles is: which of the new-
ly engaged brothers will be first
to hold a wedding reception in the
new house Jim Jordan, Joe Jor-
dan, Frank Smith, Lawrence Mon-
crief and Jimmy Lewis are the
brothers who succumbed to some
well-laid leap year tactics.

TPA pledges will get up off
their knees next Saturday night
to be feted by the actives at South
Park Lodge. The affair is not in
the hard-times motif. Heels and

talists.

rest easy. All blackjacks, rubber’

stuff will be in vogue‘ for the
night.

Founders’ Day breakfast is the
neiit event on the TPA calendar.
The "celebration is slated with
alums for May 2.

Tomorrow members of Delta
Zeta here are hostesses for the
DZee state ‘convention, scheduled
in Pittsburgh this time. Big ac-
tivity for the afternoon is a lunch-

eon at Webster Hall. Irene C.‘

Boughton, national secretary; of
the sorority, is featured speaker.
The affair will close with a dance
at the house in the‘ evening.

SAE men and dates get decked
out in tuxes and formals tomor-
row evening for the SAE spring

the J acktown Hotel. A dinner will
be served late in the evening.

Dn Foster Stage Next

“Curtain Time,” Pitt Players program of experimental drama, is
well under way and will be staged in Foster Memorial Hall April
22, 23, and 24.

The three one-act plays are all student-directed, two of them
-being the product of Pitt writers. _

“Existent,” Stuart Workmaster’s tense portrayal of the 1940 Cam-
bria County mine disaster leads off the series. Inspired by the need
for better mine safety policies,
Workmaster’s play depicts the last
hours of the seven doomed miners,
realistically sketching the charac-
ter of each man. .

Familiar as the boss of the de-
funct PVA, present publicity
chairman of the Panther, and as a
cnajor cog in the Independent ma-
chine, Workmaster has entered a
new ﬁeld with “Existent,” al-
though his literary talents have
attracted notice in the speech
and English departments before.
Number two of the trio is Noel
Coward’s “Fumed Oak,” a comedy
starring Players veterans Jo Bos-
co, Martha Morrison, and Jack
Ingrim. Jenny Marshall rounds
out the cast of the one act play
rated by Coward as the best of
his “Tonight at 8:80” series.

Blackstone. Committee Seek

Frank Blackstone got himself a’ Congress committee Tuesday to
investigate the library trouble at Pitt.

All Blackstone had intended was to persuade Congress to use
its inﬂuence in opening the Pitt library on Sundays. After Black-
stone presented his arguments the writer informed Congress that
freshmen were warned to stay away from the central Carnegie and
Pitt libraries when preparing investigative themes.

The Dollars that EU N the Business

These are the dollars you send to us every time you pay
your telephone bill. They're the dollars that grow out of
the nickels that you deposit when you use pay telephones.
They’re the dollars that we take in for providing the best
possible telephone service at the lowest possible cost.

These dollars run the telephone business. They pay our
taxes and our rent and our light and our heat. They pay
wages and the benefits and pensions telephone employees
enjoy. They pay interest to bondholders and dividends to
stockholders for the use of their money.

Any of these dollars that have nothing to do after paying
all that they have to pay— and there are never many — are

put away for a rainy day.’

 

The Dollars that BUILD the Business

These‘ are the dollars -— saved by school teachers, widows,
farmers, business men, telephone men and women and other
everyday people in all walks of life -— with which telephone

securities are bought.

With these dollars, new central oﬂices are built and
equipped, other central oﬂices are enlarged, and all tele-
phone equipI_nent—-switchbonards, dial mechanisms, wire
and cable, telephone instruments —-— are bought.

These are the dollars that build the business—that
enable us to meet increasing demands for telephone service
by expanding our facilities to provide it . . . that enable us
to make the continual improvements that bringiyou the best
possible telephone service at the lowest possible" cost.

_- We must pay for the use of these dollars. Those who
supply them expect us to keep them safe and to keep them

which Mr. Serkin will appear as
soloist.

iBorn in Czechoslovakia, Rudolf
Serkin was a child prodigy but his
parents resolved not to exploit the
youngster.

At 12 he made his debut with
the Vienna. Symphony and en-
thusiastic offers poured in from
concert managers. Again his par-
ents decided he was too young
to start concertizing.

Rudolf Serkin ﬁrst played in the
United States at the Coolidge Fes-
tival in Washington. His debut as
a solo pianist did not come until

' Toscanini chose him as guest ar-

tist in 1936 with the New York
Philharmonic orchestra.

He made a brilliant impression,
receiving an ovation such as had
seldom‘ been witnessed in Car-
negie Hall. He has since duplicat-
ed that original triumph in prac-
tically every American city.

¢ The stripitickets admit two to

the Main Ball and one to each of
the other events. If the tickets are
bought separately the prices are:
Tea Dance $.65,iBand Concert $.75,
Pitt Players’ production, “Would-
be Gentleman,” $1.00 and the
Main Ball $3.25.

In addition to the big saving,-

the committee has arranged to
give, a pack of Camels in a plastic
case to each person attending any
paid event. S

Len Matonak, business manager
for the Spring Festival says,
“There will be only 1000 strip
tickets sold.” The strips will be
divided into two sets, one for the
Pitt Players’ production Thursday
night and one for Saturday night.
Admission to the Main Ball will
be limited to 2§O0 couples to pro-
vide maximum comfort for danc-
ing. Tickets go on sale today at
the Student Activities Desk.

“All this for only ﬁve dollars.
It’s a lot of fun and a bargain, too.
So get a strip of tickets and come
to the 1948 Spring Festival! The
International Festival,”_ James
Madden, Festival -Publicity Direct-
or, announces. -‘ .

Fervently praying for sunshine,
Pitt’s divot-diggers sat out the
week. The only consolation for
lost practice was postponement
’ until Tuesday of a match with
Juniata, originally set for Mon-
day.

The prospects of Coach Geb-
hard Stegeman’s swingers ending
the drought of seven straight de-
feats last spring are good. Eight
regulars and some promising new-
comers should make the squad a
strong one. ,

Practice rounds thus far have
produced nothing sensational, the
best score a 76 posted by Jim
White on_his second round. His
ﬁrst 18 holes took 80 strokes. Oth-
er low scores were a 77 by Al
McBride, a 78 by Bill Burress, and
Jack Sim0n’s 79.

PiKAs To!!! Six
Enter deyetis

PiKA’s rangy volleyball sextet
swept past the favored Pi Lams,
15-10, 15-8, to qualify for the ﬁnal
match in the IF championship
playoﬁs. They will meet the win-
ner of the consolation round after
the latter is determined in match-
es next week.

Al Rose and Sam Haddad spiked

the Joe Muller-coached team to’

their victory Tuesday at Trees
Gym. The PiKAs are the only un-
-beaten team in the playoff round.
In other matches, the PiKAs
swamped Delta Tau Delta in two
games, and the Phi Eps outlasted
a scrappy Theta Chi outﬁt that
lacked height but not hustle.

been made.

With Juniata *

Juniata College, the toughest
team on last season’s- baseball
schedule, comes to the Stadium
Monday for Pitt’s ﬁrst home game.
Game time is 3:30. _ ‘ -

Last year the Panthers traveled
to Huntingdon where Indian
pitcher Dick Frick put them on a

two-hit diet. Juniata won handily
by an 8-2’”score.

Bill Smaltz, who was one of the
nation’s top football passers sev-
en years ago at Penn State, is in
his second season as Juniata'base_-
ball coach. At Juniata, athletics ‘
is a family proposition. Smaltz’
wife, Betty Rank Smaltz, is direct-
or of women’s physical education. '

The J uniata baseball team! com-S
piled an admirable recor_d_of ten

 

wins and four losses last; season.

Monday’s game is the only Pitt-
Juniata contest scheduled for this
season. '

Pitcher Deryl Caldger

’ This game brought to a close
the long IM season at Pitt. With
the triumph the Educators ﬁnish-
ed undefeated, winner by sub-
stantial margins over all opposi-
tion. '

With less than four minutes re-
maining in the second period, Leo
Skladany entered the game forj
the Pitt club. Leo celebrated the
occasion by dumping in a pair of
ﬁeld goals. This was enough to
put the Educators in a comfort-
able position at the half; They led
23-14. ’ 3

Never really in the game, the
Tartan ﬁve took the lead only
once. ‘

Early in the ﬁrst stanza their
big center, Ralph Sill, threw in a"
push shot, then followed it up
with two free throws. This put
his team ahead, 4-2.

How -to get rid
, of that swo d
over your head

For most of us, one thought always
hangs over our“ heads, like that
famous sword of Damocles.

 

"How can’! ever manage to save up
enough to pay off the mortgage . . .
or to send the kids to college . . . of
lo take it easy when I'm old?"

Wouldn’t it be grand if there
were an easy way to save up that
money? Well, there is. With U. S.
Bonds!

, You can ‘buy Bonds regularly
through the Bond-A-Month Plan at
this bank. ' —

U. S. Bonds repay you $4 for
every $3 you save, in ten years. So
choose the sum you can aﬂ'ord--
and start saving today.

The‘ State team ‘lérgély a

tions stripped the Lions of .three- ,
fourths of their starting inﬁeld,-
one outﬁelder, and all of 'last”
year’s experienced pitchers with
the exception of Gehrett. ' ‘

I Pitt Has Veterans

But there is consolation ‘for
State fans in that their one return-
ing outﬁelder is -leftﬁelder Don
Stark, a young clubber wholoafs
constantly in the vicinity of .400‘
batting average. , ,

Pitt’s line-up, the antithesis of
Penn State’s, contains veteran
players in all but two positions.__
Frank Susko, a stocky little South-
paw, is the probable choice for
left ﬁeld, while Frank Couch, a
long ball hitter, sets up camp in’
right. . .

As a batter, Susko deals in short"
line drives over the inﬂeld."Couch,..
on the other hand, has driven sevu 
eral balls well over 300 feet-in 
practice sessions.

Smodic Hopes ’ to Improve .

Sandwiched between the two
rookie outﬁelders is centerﬁelder
Jack Smddic, who covers the mid-
dle territory adequately but is
hoping for a fatter batting average
than last season’s .206 mark. .

The Panther inﬁeld shows Bob ,
Rosfeld at ﬁrst base. Art Barnes 
at second, Jack Snyder at short- ‘
stop, and Dodo Canterna at third, ; ~
base. Reserve inﬁelder Bill Pef- 
ferman was lost to the team this. ‘

Shadow-Boxingl Technique

If the University ever decides to put boxing back on the
athletic card, I know where they can get 33 coaches. The Board
of Trustees—my candidates-—are not well. versed on the’body
contact so unavoidable in the ring, but when it comes to ex-

pert side-stepping and artful iss

Of course, with the Trustccse

coaching our boxing team, there
may be a parade of “No Decision”
ﬁghts, but the back-pedaling of
our boys will win the admiration
of the ﬁght crowd.

-Purely on the basis of their
.Tuesday report, I think the Trust-
ees should be given every consid-
eration. It was a masterpiece of

Trustees Did Aztec '

Skeptics who have derided the
Trustees for failure to take def-
inite action are being unfair.
After all, did -they not ‘agree to
do nothing? I ignore the taunts
of another minority group that
_claims the Trustees passed the
buck right back to the Univer-
sity. '

_The ‘accuracy of the charge is
too. obvious‘ to be worthy of com-
ment.

From beginning to end, the re-
port represents a compromise.
Not’ on a par, perhaps, with the
Missouri Compromise but worthy
of recognition, nonetheless.

Everybody Loves Everybody

Spring will pass into Summer
and Summer will continue until.
Fall,’ and the Trustees -will insist
"that there. should be complete"
cooperation on the part of all
authorities connected with the ath-
letic situation at the University."

This, tome, is heartening al-
thotghthe phrasing of the state-
ment maylead a few outsiders ‘to
believe we lack complete cooper-
ation. Perish the thought, gentle-
men. ’ _ _
_ All is sweetness and good will
both on‘ the hill and in the Ca-
.thedral. -I might even propose is
slogan: How are we going to co-
operate if we _don’t operate?

lead you, however. The report has

completely, the Student-Alumni
report, he was so touched, he

_ I am sure the administration is
celebrating. Now four faculty
members may try where six failed‘
before. Furthermore, the power
to hire or ﬁre ‘remains in the

I feel certain Mike Milligan and
James Hagan are content. The
long boredom of Summer will be

lessened by the surprise announce-
ment which may come to either at
any moment. And think of all the
Law School students.

The Trustees’ report will aid
them immeasurably when they
must writepapers which are very
vague aboutnothing in general.

Yes, we ‘have passed a mile-
stone,’ and it has a surprisingly
familiar look.‘ It,  possible that
this milestone is the same one
we passed last fall?
