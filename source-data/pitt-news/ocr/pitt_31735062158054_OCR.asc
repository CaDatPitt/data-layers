In Monday afternoon’s workout,
however, the soph fullback aggra-

to be running better than he has

Commentaries

By NANCY JONES and
ROSE MARIE SCARPIELLO

Pitt’s innovation of women
cheerleaders has been greeted by
mixed emotions from the student
body. The question, “What do you

»_ think of the women cheerleaders

at Pitt now?”, received replies
from “tremendous” to “somewhat
high schooli.sh.”

Out of 22 students queried
'14 made complimentary‘ re-
marks, six did not like the idea
of women cheerleaders, and two
were undecided. V

A poll taken one year ago turn-
ed out with similar results al-
though the query at that time was
whether students thought Pitt
would beneﬁt from girl cheerers.
The run-down on that poll show-
ed twelve men were enthusi-

1 astically in support of the idea,

ﬁve women favored it, and three

‘ women said no.

Don Nipps, Eng. ’56 has not
changed his opinion now that
he has seen some real women
on the stadium
ﬁeld. In last year’s NEWS (Nov.

_ 18), Don said he favored them

because they would add color to

‘L the games.

Now Don wants “more of them.”
He favors them over boys.

Duane Backstrom, a freshman,
says, “They’re alright but they

An additional 100 frosh co—eds and
male students will be able to at-

According to MC chairman,
Bob. Butcher, Col. ’57, freshmen
must obtain special tickets for

Many Attitudes Toward Women Cheerleaders

 

   

 

WONDER WOMEN—Most Pitt
‘students who know what they
like when they see it, are happy
to see them—women cheerlead-

the women add enthusiasm and

spirit to the cheering section.

Those who liked the change
said:

Orville Boone, Bus. Ad. ’55,
thinks they ‘are trying hard and
“doing a very good job, showing
a‘ lot of enthusiasm.”

Margie Shiner, Col. ’58, es-
pecially likes the uniforms. ;‘They
give a sharp appearance.”

Charles Allsopp, Col. ’56, thinks,
“The female touch has deﬁnitely
inspired better‘ cheering.” ‘

William Mazzocco, Col. .’55,

thinks everyone should back the
cheerleaders 100 per cent because
they are doing a ﬁne job.

In contrast to this is the idea
of Dick Blosser, Col. ’56, who says
the women make a good appear-
ance, but that the “people aren’t
giving them a chance.”

V. Shirley Simons, Col. ’55, doesn’t

before.”

“We should have had women
cheerleaders a long time ago!”,
says Nancy Donaldson, Col. ’56.

Bill Sutherland, Col. ’50, says,
“Women cheerleading is deﬁnitely
in good taste——-not unladylike.”

' Students’ who dislike the
change said; ,

Bernard Fenik, Col. ’56, doesn’t
think any more enthusiasm has
been added to the cheering than
when the men led the cheers.

Marilyn. Shackter, Col. ’55 and
L'ou~Pomrenke, Bus. Ad. ’56, voice
the same 1 .opinion—the women
cheerleaders s h o u l d n ’ t make
shrieking between cheers a regu-
lar part of the routine.

Maggi Bla-ndford, Col. ’57,
said her ﬁr'st impression of the
female cheerleaders was,

atmosphere at a University

Sue Hawley, Ed. ’56, thinks that
new cheers would improve the
whole situation.

Likewise Phil Work, Col. ’55,
feels, “We deﬁnitely need more

He’s Joe Lamartime, Col. ’58,
who was chosen Wednesdayby a

Physical Education department. * «
A__native Philadelphian, Lamar- ,

tine got the committee’s nod on
the basis of personality, gym-

and physical stre-ngth. He com-
peted with Bob Musulin, Col. ’56,
for the Panther post.

Both Musulin and Lamartine
performed in the traditional Pan-
ther garb at football games this
year. Musulin filled the furry
brown suit at the Minnesota open-
er and Lamartine cavorted before
the capacity crowd at last Satur-
day’s Notre Dame contest. The
judging committee announced its
decision Wednesday afternoon.

Gymnastic coach Warren E.
Neiger, who headed the judging
committee, said that there had
been some criticism of past Pan-
thers’ lacking gymnastic talent.
He said that Lamartine’s tumbling
ability was one of the prime fac-
tors that won him the job.

Other judging committee mem-
bers were swimming coach Ben

(Editor’s note: This is the first
of a series of articles on the J
various schools within the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.)
“Developing the ability to

V be a lawyer”'is the aim of the

University’s School of Law,
acording to Charles W. Tain-
tor, acting dean.

A three year course in the
University and a six month
clerkship in as law ofﬁce is
required for graduation from
the law school.

Eight. full time and four part
time i.nstructors are on this year’s
faculty. Outside speakers will as-
sist lectures.

High Grades Needed

To gain entrance to the School
of Law,,outstanding grades must
be maintained during undergradu-
ate studies, and‘a law student ap-
titude test must be taken.

According to Taintor, the ap-
. plicant must demonstrate more

than the minimum abilities in
college.

First year courses are given in
contracts, procedure, criminal law,
and torts. ‘Moot trials are con-

the law, we try to develop the
ability to apply the lawyer’s tech-

This technique “consists almost
wholly of reading, writing, and

Upon completion of the re-
quirements, g r a d u a t e s are

‘A letter appeared on.the editor’s desk today. Its sub-

Robert M. Hutchins, under whose presidency Chicago

He states, ‘?I bglieve that one of the reasons why we

_ He points out that~a college president must know, the
‘corrupt practices that arebeing used to buildhis football

squad, but if he tries to stop them he runs afoul of promi- I

-nent alumni on the board of trustees or board of regents,
or alumni with endowment-available money. The president
needs that. money to keep his school going.

‘ Hutchin’s solution lies with professional football and
the time when people will no longer pay to see a college
football game. He believes that money willlthen be spent in

improving education and advancing knowledge. “This,” he '

concludes, “happened at Chicago.” ,
These facts are well_ ordered and certainly spring from

. an authority but still there is a question. Is it possible for

i 9 such a man as Hitchins to be so far removed from the stu— I

dent body that he. fails to grasp the full and overall effect
of a sport such as football upon these .students?

The student, after, a week’s grind, needs some sort of

a psychological cusion tofall back on. The steam that shoots
off in all directions during a football game is an essential
part of student life. ’ I ~

'  Onthe other side of the ledger is emblazoned the fact
that a minority of students, based on total university en-
rollment at Pitt’, actually attend home games. If the ex-
penditure frsr college football is to be justiﬁed, it would
seem natural that-a majority of students should derive be-
neﬁts from it.

e Hutchin’s article cannot be shelved for he is in a posi-
tion to know. The University of Chicago is one of the most
highly rated institutions in the country. But so is the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

A Problem for Humanyty . . .

Segregation

. By Melvin Abrams

The recent‘ demonstrations of
high school students in Washing-
ton and Baltimore against the
integration of Negroes‘ and
Whites into a_ single school sys-
tem is of concern to all students.

The Supreme Court decision
ending segregation in the schools
was a welcome and long over-
due step towards the perfection
of democracy in these United
States. It will remove an implied
slur on colored Americans and
spare white students from the
warping effect of being treated
as a superior elite.
Moral Democracy

The Supreme Court ruling
gives to our schools the opportun-

A ity to practice ‘the .principles of
a moral democracy. These, prin- ‘

ciples whichcould only be read

about and discussed will" then be '
demonstrated. Further, a costly .

     
   

dual schol system in the‘ south-

  

ern states has long been a finan-
cial burden that theregion and
the nation could ill afford. _

Yet in the crucial areas segre-
gation is being protected and
fought for by a bigoted minority
blinded by their own fanaticism.
Baltimore and Washington are
not the only communities con-
fronted by the same problem.

V They are the scenes of the most

spectacular and the latest in, a
series of demonstrations. Dela-
ware was faced with the same
problem at Milford, West Vir-
ginia gave up at -White Sulphur
Springs and Hillsboro, Ohio still
practices segregation in its
schools. It is in communities like
these that some action“ must be‘
taken to protect the ﬂights of all
citizens. “

that the -court ruling against
segregation was a blow‘ against

Erdelatz Out: to   Show “Teac|1er"

Hamilton Also Eager  

To Reverse Instruction

_, By JOEL MERENSTEIN

Scuttle the Captain will be the Navy cry as they launch
their attack at Pitt Stadium tomorrow. The Captain, of
course, is Pitt Athletic Director Tom Hamilton former play-
er, coach and Athletic Director at the Naval Academy. _

Navy head mentor Eddie Erdelatz hopes to prove to l'11S
former_ boss that he has learned,we11. Erdelatz served as
end coach during the 1946 and ’47 seasons with Hamilton

as topibrass of the coaching staffﬁ

The Navy may want very badly
to defeat their former member but
the reverse is also true. Hamilton

has said “Right now I most want ,

to beat Navy. It’s like a family
ﬁght for me.”
Pre-Flight Student
It seems that Erdelatz has al-
ways been a deﬁnite part of ‘that

family on and off the gridiron.

The Annapolis coach was a stu-
dent in the special Naval pre-
ﬂight training program which
was established and operated by
Captain Hamilton during World
War II.

 Coach Erdelatz guides his un-

defeated service team into Pitts-

burgh for its ﬁrst meeting with
the Panthers since 1934. That team
also came here undefeated and
was coached by that same Tom
Hamilton aiming to blast the
Middies tomorrow. _
Pittsburgth waved the victory
ﬂag after that 1934 tilt, however,

as Cap’n Tom’s Midshipmen bat-'

tled in vain sinking to the depths
of defeat for the only time that
season. A 0

a Record Even

The present Navy mentor hopes
his boys. of blue don’t meet the
same fate in tomorrow’s_ conflict
for this game can put his ﬁve-year

coaching record over the .500 wa-

ter mark.

His Navy log at present reads
18 wins, 18 losses and 4 ties. The
41-year old St. Mary’s graduate

column for «the,ﬁrst time in four.

year. ‘ If his Midshipmen can
emerge victorious in this battle,

they will have matched their last
year’s slate of going undefeated
in their first four games.

The Navy gridinon Admiral
feels that this is the best team he

‘ has handléd at the service school.

The experts are agreeing With
him as they are comparing them
to some of Captain‘ Hamilton’s
old teams at the Academy-

Pro Football Clash

After all the similiarties shown
between the two Navy men, Past
and present, it may seem that
Erdelatz is just a reprint’ of the
Pitt Athletic Director. There 18
one part -of the game, however.
where they violently» clash—-7pr0-
fessional football.

While Hamilton hasbeen ac-
cused of being one of pro-foot-
ba1l’s most active enemies, Erde-
latz is a former line coach for
the San Francisco Forty--Niners.

In fact, his lines for the Gold-
en Gaters possessed the best de-
fensive records in the» All-Amer-
ican Conference despite‘ the fact
they were the league’s lightest
This outstanding defense can al-
solbe credited to his Navy team
this year as they have yielded
only seven points in three games.
Last week they outcharged fav-

ored Stanford all afternoon even

though they were outweighed by
20-pounds W per man.

This isn’t the first such line for
Erdelatz at, the’ Naval Academy,
though. His 1952 defensive unit
was one of the nation’s best; ﬁn-
ishing the season insecond place
in rushing defense and sixth in
total defense.

Injuries Continue To Hinder
Freshmen Gridder Practice

By BERNIE MORRIS

Injuries continued to plague the freshmen eleven as

they moved into their third week. of drills, with forty-three
candidates battling for a starting berth. , ,
Coach Steve Petro.’s squad, already weakened by the loss

of Jim Oliver,
with. a broken leg, received an
added jolt as center Gene Min-
archick tore several ligaments in
his leg and will be lost temporar-
ily.

Minarchick was being counted
upon for yeoman duty and Petro
must now come up with a satis-
factory replacement. Jim Saba-
Vladovich looked
good in the pivot position and
the possibility exists that one of

them will replace the injured
Manarchick.
Sabatini, a good offensive

blocker, seems to have the edge
at the moment ,but Vladovich’s
line-backing prowess may yet win
him a starting position.

One of the pleasant surprises
of the squad has been the impres-
sive perfor.mances of Eugene
Uccellini, a 5’8” 205—pound guard
from Mt. Lebanon. Uccellini has
been waging a battle with John

indeﬁnitely out ¢

Guzik for one of the guard posi-
tions. Nick Carr, one of the “im-
ports” from Charlestown, W. Va.,
has also looked very good at a
guard slot. -

Ron Kissel, a tough 250-pound“

tackle has performed well and
may be teamed with Jim Mc-
Cusker at the tackle positions. Kis-
sel is fast and aggressive and has
served notice he will be tough
to beat out. 7

Coaches Steve Petro and his as-
sistant Carl DePasqua have mov-
ed David'Gustafson from a tackle
to an end spot. Gustafson has been
booming the ball downﬁeld dur-
ing practice and may,handle the
kicking chores for the Panthers.
The staff also moved Bob ‘Man-
ners to a tackle berth.

Villanova Starts “Power Run”
For Panther Harriers H are

By STEVE» BUTCHOCK ’ 1

Beginning with the Villanova Wildcatstomorrow morn-
ing, and continuing for the next two weeks, the Panther
harriers are confronted with nothing less than a Herculan
task in their efforts to rack up another undefeated season.

After the Wildcat meet, the local thinc-lads travelto
New York for a triangular match wth Army and Manhat-
tan before Penn State’s Nittany Lions get a crack at the

\.

Olsonmen.

But in facing the Wildcats
the Olsonmen will undoubtedly
be facing the toughest represen-
tative in the eastern part of the
state, if past records give any in-
diaction of what’s in store to-’
morrow.

‘The achievements of the visitors,
in ‘the track world has been noth-
ing show of phenomenal in the
past decade, and when a school
is able to produce track stars the
caliber of Fred Dwyer, it sort of
adds to the discomfort.

For the first time this season
Coach Olson has been leaning to-
wards a tussle with a pessimistic
point of view.’And this is the ﬁrst
contest in which Olson’s squad
will attempt to prove him wrong.

Another note of discourage-
ment on the strength of the
Wildcats is they have already
subdued a highly-rated Army
team with relative. ease, and did
it on the Cadet’s home course at
West Point. .

scene, the Panther harriers have

Pitt’s surprising soccer team
will attempt to establish itself as
a leading power when the Pan-
ther booters take on Ohio State
and Denison today and tomorrow
at the Ohio schools.

After upsetting high-ranking
Slippery Rock 1-0 last Saturday,
the Pitt kickers are being consid-
ered darkhorse candidates for the
top team spot in the East and a

(double victory‘ over strong op-
P position

this weekend could
strengthen their position. ,
Ohio State should prove a
rugged test for Coach Leo
Bemis’ improved squad. The
Buckeyes lost only twice last
season and have another strong
team this year. .

Following the contest in Colum-
bus today, the Panther. kickers
will meet another ‘tough opponent
in Denison tomorrow afternoon.

Last year the Big Red whipped

the inexperienced Pittsburgh team

_ 6-3 and they have practically the

same team returning this season.

Strengthening the locals will be
the return of center John D’Ama-
to, who was unable to play at Slip-
pery Rock.‘ D’Amato scored‘ four
goals in the Panthers rout of In-

? diana Teachers and is the Pitt-

ites leading scoring threat.

Although he pointed out that .

’ the Slippery Rock win was a
team victory, Conch Bemis gave‘
»much credit to the Panther’s
strong defense. Fullbacks Nor-
man Zanardellit and Phil Rog-
ers and goalie Don Clark stood
011’ many Rocket attacks.

..The loss was only thethirdin ..

five years for the Slippery Rock

team and was one. of the biggest.
upsets of the current soccer sea- ,
.son.

sophomore, Beagle led all Middies
in pass receptions with 14 for 146
yards. In three games so far Bea-
gle has snagged three touchdown
aerials.

Last year’s leading _ ground-
gainer for Midshipmen was full-
back Joe Gattuse who churned
out 412 yards in 53 tries. The. sen-
ior fullback also was the team's

Missed Papers

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

This is the week of ironies for the Panther football team.
What with Head Coach Red Dawson in the hospital and
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton now in charge, more para-
doxical situations have cropped up than the newspapers can

keep up with.

To begin with, Captain Hamilton is a former Naval
Academy graduate and head football coach there and to-

morrow will be directing a squadé

against them.

Then, there’s the angle of a
former Naval ofﬁcer leading the
Pitts whie the mentor: of” the
Middies isn’t even a commission-
ed ofﬁcerat the present time.

Of course, this could go on
but one important view is sort
of overooked. That is, that here
is a Navy team with a line av-
eraging only 191 pounds and a
backﬁeld averaging 171, play-
ing a _fairly tough schedule, and
clipping the games off with ap-
parent ease. '

As the Navy Publicity Director,
John T. Cox, said, “This is prob"-
ably the smallest line in college
football today.”

‘And, on top of all this, credit
to date for the Academy’s success
is accredited to this line "which

has only" two starters left fromg

last year. The backﬁeld, in fact,

the ﬁrsttwo strings, are lettermen

from previouslcampaigns but they
are not the ones that receive the
most acclaim.

At the beginning of this fall,

moreover, the early “line” had
Pitt favoredto beat the Midship-
men but naturally the same
doesn’t hold true now. Releases
from Navy has stressed that “man
for man, this year’s Navy squad
doesn’t measure up to the 1953
team.”

But these fellows have sur-
prised everyone. Coach Eddie
Erdelatz was so overwhelmed
at the showing last Saturday
out at Stanford that hevsaid that
“this is the best team I’ve had
here at the Academy in my ﬁve

‘ seasons.” ’

   

I

Of course, all these above facts

are things ﬁgured out on paper.
When the teams take to the ﬁeld,
though, this paper stuff usually
doesn’t mean much. Evidently, lo-
cal fans are convinced of this be-

cause a crowd of over. 30,000 is

expected, hoping’ that the Pan-
thers didn’t -read the papers, this
week andiwill ship the Middies

home with their initial loss. Well,

we can dream, can’t We?

‘Moon is Ejue’

Recommenderi

L By GERRY McCAULEY

‘ If a 13121;, sparked"-with a sug-
gestive and humorous dialogue is
your preference in theatrical en-
tertainment, “The, Moon is Blue”
should more than fill the bill. The
Nixon’s current attraction, appear-
ing through the evening of Oct. 23,
is more than ably presented by a

actor Jerome Cowan with assist-
ance from a sprightly Martha Ran-
dall playing
O’Neill. .
Mr. Cowan’s presentation of
David Slater, the materialistic
but charming old codger, adds
the punch where needed in F.
-Hugh Herbert’s play. And Mar-
tha. Randall’s portrayal of the
sometimes too naive and unin-
hibited husband seeker is cer-
tainly in line with her role.

If there is any dampener on an
otherwise entertaining play,'it is
provided by Wayne Carson’s not
4''too convincing acting of Donald
Gresham, the successful young
architect.

The play itself, which moves
along rapidly once past the
opening scene, tells a story of
hilarity and confusion around
the theme of what happens to
the characters involved when
a naive “pick-up” accepts the
invitation to have a few mar-
tinis with “affection but no pas-
sior” before dinner at the eli-
gible bachelor’s apartment.

How theiplay progresses from
here proves to be entertaining
through the use of a sharp dia-
logue and a clever arrangement
of the sequences which fol1o'w.
Other than the one obvious mis-
cast you should ﬁnd “The Moon
is Blue” at its‘ best.
