It had been a pretty quiet night so far
for campus police officer Norman Wise,
who was cruising the campus area last
Friday in his sleek, midnight—blue
patrol car. The Pirates’ National League
championship series game was on and
most people were watching it; but the
game was almost over and the police
radio was lively as officers throughout
the city gearedup for the postgame
bedlam.

Although The Pitt News photographer
Matt Serlin and I were having an inter-
esting night riding around and talking
to Wise about his job, we were hoping
to see some action. Wise, a seven-year
veteran of the department, had warned
us earlier that we might not see what
we expected.

quiet protest
on campus

By Nathan Maynard
and Jim Madl
For The Pitt News

The Student Environmental
Action Coalition and the Native
American Support Group staged
a quiet protest outside of the
William Pitt Union to promote
the awareness of the problems
that Native Americans are facing.

The protest began on Tuesday
morning at 6 a.m. and will con-
tinue until Thursday at 11 a.m.
when they will hold a rally fea-
turing speakers from Green
Peace.

The groups are concerned
with the construction of the
Mount Graham International
Observatory because it is sacred
to the San Carlos Apache Tribe.
The construction is sponsored
by the University of Arizona.
The University of Pittsburgh has
been asked to contribute $15
million to help finance the con-
struction of the observatory. Pitt
would then own one quarter of
the telescope.

Sophomore Marlo
Marcheleovich said, “I don’t
agree with it  We’ve already
taken away land from the
Indians, we should at least let
them have their mountain.”

One protestor said that the
building of the structure would
destroy five ecosystems, includ-
ing the endangered Mount
Graham red squirrel and the
threatened Apache trout.

“It’s sacrilegious that they put
money toward these things with
absolutely no regard for the lives
they’ll be affecting,” Pitt sopho-
more Olivia Kissel said.

Pitt has not yet promised to

going to go,” the tall, square, fiftiesh
man had said. “Some nights you expect
something to happen but nothing does,
and some nights things are going on
the whole time.”

When the police dispatcher broke in
and said, “Game over. It’s Pirates, 5-2,”
Wise said, “Oh Christ.” He sped down
to Bigelow Boulevard between the
William Pitt. Union and the Cathedral of
Learning, pulled over and sat waiting,
his eyes flicking over the traffic ﬂowing
down Forbes Avenue.

Faint victory cries came from the bar
area on Forbes as, one by one, officers
in the area radioed in reporting normal
traffic and crowds. At 11:28 p.m. the
dispatcher broke in.

“Thirty-eight-hundred block of
Dawson Street off of South Bouquet,
report of two males fighting, one has a
gun,” she said. “One male six-foot,

7796‘ Cola’ War is overbuz‘ some Marxist theories are alive at Pitz

ByMike Laughlin
Staj_"fWriter
With the collapse of

,Communism in the former

Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe and China’s movement
toward a free—market economy,
one might think that fans of
Karl Marx have gone the way
of the dinosaurs.

Not so with David Houston,‘
a professor of _economics here
at the University of Pittsburgh.
He teaches regional and urban
economics along with radical
economic theory, and he clings
unabashedly to the principles
and beliefs of Marxism.

“[Capitalism] is a system of
exploitation,” Houston said.
He explained Marx’s views on
how the very small proportion
of society that owns the wealth
and means of production takes
value away from the rest of the
population.

He said they must sell their
own labor to the wealthy
property owners, and this sys-

tem of depending on the

benevolence of property own-
ers lead to problems of
inequality, poverty, homeless-
ness and crime. I

“I think Marx’s analysis on
political economy is the most
fruitful way to understand cap-
italism,” Houston said.

Houston has an FBI memo
addressed to Pitt and dated in
May of 1970 recommending
that he should be fired.

“... His removal from his
position at the University of
Pittsburgh would _be most ben-
eficial,” the memo stated,
although the FBI could not do
this because Houston already
had tenure as a condition of
being hired at Pitt.

Houston grew up in
Philadelphia and did both his
undergraduate and graduate
work at the University of
Pennsylvania from 1949 to

David Houston, professor at Pitt.

1957. He earned a doctorate in
American civilization, which he
describes as a mixture of histo-
ry and literature.

He went on to UCLA’s
School of Business in 1957 and
started working on a disserta-
tion about insurance. During
that time he was working
closely with economists and
found himself enjoying discus-
sions and writings about eco-

-nomics, so he decided to teach

the discipline.

“I decided it was for me. It
was more intellectually satisfy-
ing,” Houston said.

Penn State hired him in

1964,, but he only worked _
- there ‘for two years.» Then in

1966 he came to Pitt and has
been here. ever since. Houston
explained that he wanted to
work in an urban environment
and that Pitt offered the best
opportunity for this setting.

As with so many other peo-

ple at the time, Houston"

cal politics of the late 1960s.
He said that he took part in
protest demonstrations and ral-
lies. at the time in the hope of
changing society for the better.

In 1969 Houston managed to
get his picture on front pages
of local newspapers because
of his participation in an anti-
war protest in front of the

" Duquesne Club downtown,

which he described as an
“elite, ruling-class watering
hole.” The police arrested
Houston and 13 others, includ-
ing students and faculty mem-
bers of other universities.
Photographers were at the
scene to take pictures of the

-protestors being carried away

by the police.

fields at Pitt in 1969, and they
created an informal, non—credit
class on their own thatwas a
reading and discussion group.
The main subject of their_dis-
cussions was what was wrong

with society.
These events led to
Houston’s conversion to

Marxism. While this may sur-
prise some, Houston is not
interested in destroying capital-
ism entirely, but interested
only in trying to make it more
humane.

“I believe how a capitalist
society changes involves many
fragments against particular .
injustices,” he said.

Houston said that capitalism
can be changed for the better
by various groups such as
blacks fighting for civil rights,

feminists fighting for womens’
rights and labor unions fight-
ing for workers’ rights.

One of the events in his aca-
demic career that he is proud
of is his involvement in estab-
lishing the alternative curricu-
lum with other students. He
said it is a very exciting pro-
gram that students set up on
their own.

The program lasted from
1973 to 1978 and was abol-
ished by Pitt because the
administration felt the program
was too radical and produced
too many 'left—wing students.

expansion. He is a member of
Peoples’ Oakland, a communi-
ty group formed in the 1970s
to contain Pitt’s expansionism.

Pitt used to do whatever it
wanted in the Oakland area as
far as expansion wen-t,
Houston said. He said that he
now feels that the group has
made the university far’ more
sensitive to the community.

The group tried unsuccess-
fully to save Forbes Field, but

it met with success in stopping’

Pitt’s “master plan” to extend
the campus from Oakland
Avenue to Bates Street.

“Our feeling was that they
would never stop. We slowed
them down,” he said.

Houston said he dislikes
Pitt’s way of thinking that it
can make itself a better institu-
tion of higher learning by sim-
ply getting bigger, while allow-
ing the quality of its under-
graduate education to decline.

He blames this decline on a

Pitt sales of PAAL

_ By Greg Virostek

For The Pitt News

The Personal Attack Alarm is
having a hard time warming up
to Pitt students, even though it
is offered for free in some
places.

The device is about the size
of a garage door opener. It can
be hand—held, clipped onto a
belt or purse and even attached
to a door. When a safety pin is
pulled the device emits a
steady, shrill sound similar to a
car alarm. The pin can be man-
ually pulled or set to release if

The Book Center sells the

Candice Brown, administra-

felt that the risk was worth it.

“When we started making

we alerted the campus police,”
she said.

Pitt police, when asked if
they have encountered a

said they have not heard the
siren’s song yet.

The Public Safety Office said
it was trying to order the unit at

if you feel sorrow, Hallmark doesn't say itas well as Mr. Morrow

} By Leon Fuksman
Staff‘ Writer

The best way to understand
why Campus’ Greetings selected
Pitt sophomore Duane Morrow
from hundreds of students
across the United States to sup-
ply verse for its greeting cards is
to request him to write a poem
when he’s under pressure.

In an impromptu interview in
his Tower C dorm room,
Morrow’s acute ability for writ-
ing poetry was most ostensible.

He was asked to compose a‘

poem about himself, and after
glancing at his catwoman poster
several times, he responded

Edward Goldhahn
Staff‘ Writer

The Student Government
Board plans to line the wall on
Forbes Avenue between the
Towers and CJ. Barney’s with
decorative banners, according
to SGB representative Dan

,, Leichter.

‘ “I figure Forbes Avenue is
the entrance into the campus,
and it’s such a hideous looking
wall. Why not liven it up a lit-
tle bit,” Leichter said.

After plans for a mural fell
through, Leichter decided that
hanging banners resembling
those in front of Carnegie
Mellon museum would “bring
a little school spirit back to
Pitt.”

According to Leichter, the

f’) two-sided banners will be
designed by students in vari-

things to the paper that I can’t
tell other people — the paper
always understands,” he said.

Grant McCallum, creative
director of Campus Greetings,
said a panel of industry experts
picked Morrow’s outstanding
compositions based on quality
of the work and the association
to the college market.

“Duane has an act of being
sincere, and we felt his verse hit
home,” McCallum said. He was
also very ﬂexible in the various
categories of the competition.”

Morrow accidentally learned
about the competition while ﬂip-
ping through a Notre Dame
University newspaper in search
of a Dr. Seuss article recom-
mended by a friend.

He noticed an advertise-
ment for Campus Greetings’
“Sentimentality 101” competition
and immediately. began writing

poetry on collegiate themes like
meeting new people and miss-
ing friends from home.

“This was a way to convey my
feelings about college to other
students,” Morrow said. “The
company wanted the sensitivity
and a fresh opinion that other
cards didn’t express.”

The competition entitled
Campus Greeting to publish
Morrow’s verses in three color-
fully illustrated greeting cards.

In addition to a monetary
prize, Morrow’s name and
school will appear on the back
of the greeting cards.

Campus Greeting is a new
company that publishes a com-
plete line of greeting cards
designed speciﬁcally for the col-
lege market. Its cards are
presently sold all over the coun-
try, but the Pittsburgh market
has yet been established.

E--' STUDENT

GVERNMEN T

A creative writing course
taught by John Hopkins’ Center
for Advancement of Talented
Youth first introduced Morrow
to poetry during the summer
before he entered the eighth
grade. One year later, he won
first place in the Olympics of
Art, a prose competition in the
Monroeville area.

Among Morrow’s favorite
inspirations for writing is a chil-
dren’s book called Velveteen
Rabbit. “This is simple enough
for a kid to read, but this says
some deep things about love
and friendship,” hesaid. -

Currently Morrow studies
mechanical engineering, but he
said poetry is still his favorite
hobby. He entered the engineer-
ing profession hoping that it will
be a more practical career
choice than writing. _

“I am just the prototypical

mechanical engineering poet,”
Morrow laughs, leaning back in

a chair and exposing his

University of Pittsburgh
neering major shirt.

“Writing poetry goes hand to
hand with beams, structures and
stress of mechanical engineer-
ing.”

The most gratifying writing
experience for Morrow
happened last summer at a
North Carolina beach resort
when two deaf females com-
memorated him for writing

engi-

a poem about his inability to

communicate with them.

“This said that my writing
expressed an understanding of.

their world,” said Morrow.

“When people see realsituations ‘

in my poems, it’s the greatest
compliment, because this means
for them that I captured a piece
of the world.”

hearts to see what we can do as

a means to rectify the problem

from a black person’s perspec-

tive,” Clive said.
According to Clive, there is a

' need to reach out to all commu-

nities about the problem, not
just.African-Americans or whites
but a conglomerate of both

communities so that steps can
be taken to solve the problems.

“It would be wonderful to
have mixed audiences rather
than a predominantly black
audience, so others could see
there is no ﬁnger—pointing here.
The bottom line is that we can
all work together to solve our
problems,” Clive said.

Clive is not the only one who
feels this way, members of BAS
recognize many issues as prob-
lems in the African-American

community.

According to Tamara Burks, a
member of BAS, a lot of infor-
mation needs to be brought out
to the public so that communi-
ties of both African Americans
and whites can begin to solve

the problem.

“People need to realize the
issues here, "there is a lot of fin-
ger—pointing going on from
both the black and white com-
munity. I suppose it started
somewhere along the line, but
it is holding both communities

"back from dealing with the

problem,” she said.

Clint Williams, a member of
BAS who is from Queens, N.Y.,
has had many friends who have
been shot, murdered or who
are in jail. “A lot of them had no
other way out, they had no
future as far as they were
concerned. My family is what
kept me from going wrong,
we ‘really stuck together,” he
said.

According to Williams, a lot .

of African Americans have no
other way to survive, “A lot of
my friends back home had to
pay rent to their moms and
dads. They were the moms and
dads of the house, they had to
pay the bills. You can’t get that
money working in McDonald’s,”
he said.

“The idea was to get away
from standard multiple choice
tests and move toward tests
that require students to think
more,” Peterson said.

The newly developed
examination system would
focus on skills such _as think-
ing and problem solving.

This new system would
emphasize the ability to inte-
grate knowledge from the
areas of reading, writing,
—_mathematics, science, history
and social science in solving
problems.

The NSP would not only
keep a record of students’
examination performance but
also a record of their projects,
exhibitions and portfolios.

This Cumulative
Accomplishments Component
would give students the
opportunity to display what
they feel are their most
promising accomplishments.

Both the student’s examina-
tion scores and “his or her
cumulative ‘accomplishments
will be compared to a “high”
standard of certification set
up to be competitive with
global standards of education.

According to Peterson, cer-
tification will be connected to
job entry as well as entry into
college The first certification
would occur at about age 16.

The NSP is funded by The
John D. and Catherine
MacArthur Foundation and
The'Pew Charitable Trusts.

“[This project] is the biggest
education project out there
now,” Peterson said.

The project also emphasizes
the role of teachers in the
educational process.

“This is a teacher-driven
project,” Peterson said.
Approximately 550 teachers
attended the two teacher con-
ferences that were held last
summer. ‘

over the years, and on the
declining advocacy role of the
faculty, along with a student
body that is much more
accepting and passive with
much less optimism and hope.

When asked what he thinks
of the rejection of Marxism in
the former SovietUnion, he
explained how the Russians
tried to create something bet-
ter, but it was so deformed
thatthey embraced capitalism
as a reaction.

Houston criticized Boris
Yeltsin, the president of
the Russian Federation, for
handling the situation so poor-
ly.
“I may be a cog, but I try to
be sand in the wheel,”
Houston said, on how he deals
with living and working
within a capitalist society at a
university that is described as a
“corporation” by its trustees.

Houston also said that he uses”

his abilities in his situation to
advocate his beliefs.

“You make your struggle

Of the 10 banners one is still
unclaimed and is still “for real-
ly whoever shows interest,” he
said.

The project is still in its plan-
ning stages, and Leichter says
he hopes to have the banners
up by the winter holidays.

The financing for the project

   

comes from the SGB’s reserve
fund, which is a portion of the
budget allotted for permanent
structures built for the universi-
ty’.
The banners will be hung so
that designs can be seen com-
ing from either direction on
Forbes Avenue. “[The design is]
pretty much open to represent
your department or organiza-
tion. I think it will work out
good,” Leichter said.

Blaming the victirn

The question has been asked time and time again:
When is a rape a rape? Seemingly this is a question that,
rather than getting easier, is becoming more difficult to
answer. Through all of the political struggles, those suffer-
Sing the most are not the criminals but the victims.

Just the other day in Texas, as reported in USA Today,
residents of Austin marched on the courthouse to protest"
a decision not to indict a rape suspect who said that a

- woman consented to sex by asking him to use a condom.

The suspect broke into the home of a young woman and
raped her at knife-point. - She pleaded with the suspect
and asked that if he was going to rape her he use a con-
dom so she wouldn’t get a sexually transmitted disease.

The suspect wasn’t even indicted, let alone brought to
trial. What is wrong with this picture? The woman was
raped. The suspect broke ir1to her house and forced her
to have sex with him at knife—point. She didn’t consent.
That’s not wrong. She tried to protect herself. That’s not
wrong either.

Yet the grand jury decided that, based on the evidence
presented, she consented to it. That is just plain ridicu-
lous. By trying to protect herself, she protected a criminal
from jail. Now that’s irony. ’

The question was posed, when is a rape a rape? How
about right here. Let’s stop crirninalizing the victim and
start criminalizing the criminal. ' ‘

Defining homosexuals

Oregon is a state divided. A precedent-setting initiative
called Measure Nine, on Oregon’s Nov. 5 ballot, would
amend the constitutiondeﬁning homosexuality as “abnor-
mal, wrong, unnatural and perverse” and ensure that
homosexuals are not considered a minority for protection
under anti—discrirnination laws. . A

The affirmative action’ question aside, the issue here is
about defining homosexuality as “abnormal, wrong and
perverse.” To define it is wrong. No one knows whether

9 or not homosexuality is biologically determined, a choice

one makes or an act of God(s). But it is a reality and is
not something we should attempt to “do away with.” It
was Suzanne Pharr of Portland—based “No-on-9” cam-
paign who said “This is the first time in history that a con-
stitution would be amended to take away rights rather
than to extend rights.”

Whatever side of the issue you are on, take a moment
and substitute your ethnicity, race or religion in the place

4 .of homosexuality. Pharr’s comments really hit home.
. Hitler at first didn’t want to exterminate Jews. He tried to

take their rights away. The Oregon legislature is trying to
do the same thing; '

A referendum is ridiculous enough, but to actually con-
sidering amending the constitution? That is just downright
scary.

China has received most-
favored-nation (MFN) trading

‘ . status from the United States for

overa decade. This allows
China certain economic privi-
leges when conducting trade
with America. After the
Tienanmen Massacre in 1989,
Congress began trying to
impose restrictions on China
linking its MFN status to improv-
ing its record on human rights.
The most recent attempt was
vetoed by President Bush.
Though Congress’ attempt to
override the veto was unsuc-
cessful, it has again given rise to
the question of whether or not
we should penalize China for its
human rights record by revok-
ing its MFN status. Critics con-
tend that by revoking China’s
MFN status until it makes
improvements on human rights,
China will be forced to make
concessions. Nothing could be
further from the truth.

First of all, restrictions on
trade with China would derail
efforts within China to reform its
economic system and ultimately
hurt the Chinese people. China
has been experimenting with
capitalism for over a decade by
creating special economic zones
in the provinces of Guangdong
and Fujian. This new “open
door policy” has caused a surge
of economic growth‘ in these
areas, especially in Guangdong.
This region, located near Hong
Kong, has become a thriving
marketplace driven by capital-
ism. The economy there grew
27.2 percent in 1991, and over 2
million people now work for
foreign joint ventures. The stan-
dard of living has greatly
increased in these areas, and it
is widely expected that the
Chinese will eventually expand
this system of reforms to the rest
of the country.

These regions have been
given a great deal of autonomy
by leaders high in the govern-
ment who strongly believe in
reforms and the people there
now enjoy greater freedom and

prosperity. If these reforms are

implemented in the rest of the
country, greater freedom and
democracy will result. Revoking
China’s MFN status would not
only hurt. the economic welfare
of the people in those areas, but
it could also cause irreparable
harm to China’s entire reform
effort.

Secondly, revoking China’s

MFN status would haveglittle.

effect on its human rights poli-

cies. A quick look at Chinese
history will tell you that it does
not give in easily to foreign

E pressures. Over the past decade,

China has instituted what it has
called “an independent foreign
policy,” meaning that the
Chinese government would not
allow itself to be subjected to
undue influence form foreign
powers.

Granted, we are one of the
country’s principal trading part-
ners, and therefore, have a great
deal of power to inﬂuence the
decisions of its government.
China has in the past given in to
American demands on human
rights. However, these conces-
sions were merely superficial
changes and not a fundamental
change in attitude. It would
therefore be difficult to predict
how effective a punitive policy
would be in bettering China’s
human rights record. Though
the Chinese government may
promote some cosmetic changes
in order to improve its foreign
relations, the country will not
simply cave in to American
pressure just to gain a few trade
concessions. . -

Another problem with revok-

ing China’s MFN status has been.

largely overlooked. This regards
the possible implications such
an action would have on the
prospects of international securi-
ty. As a permanent member of

People of China need open trade

the UN Security Council, China
has veto power over any pro-
posal that goes through the
body. If we want to take action
in some part of the world (such
as Iraq), diplomatically or mili-
tarily, we will need the support
of China‘. Otherwise our propos-

- als are dead before they even

hit the floor of the General
Assembly. China has also
become an irnportant__ player in
improving relations between
North and South Korea and in
keeping that area of the world a
nuclear—free zone. Also, any
attempt to limit arms prolifera-
tion in the Third World will
require the cooperation of
China, one of the largest
weapons suppliers to nations
such as Iran, Pakistan and Syria.
Whatever the moral dilemmas
involved, isolating China from
the rest of the world will simply

have no effect on its attitudes _

toward human rights. It will
have serious political conse-
quences which could adversely
affect international security.
Revoking China’s MFN status
may be morally just, but from a
practical standpoint it won’t
work. We will have a better
chance of changing its attitudes
by improving relations and pro-
moting reform effort than by
isolating them.

Consistent application of our
ideals is all well and good in an
ideal world. But in the harsh
light of reality, we must under-
stand that such high ideals are
not always the best route to
take. We can argue over the
economic welfare of the
Chinese until we are blue in the
face, but we are still overlook-
ing the most important point —
we need China in order to pro-
mote our own economic and
political interests, and in this
case, pragmatism must come
before idealism.

Only by remaining open with

‘tn.’

\

the Chinese and taking things ‘

slowly can we hope to have a
positive effect on the future of
China.

With two» wins coming
against Mid-American confer-
ence lightweight Kent State
and Big Ten doormat
Minnesota, the 1992 Pitt foot-
ball season has been a major
disappointment. I

Losses to mediocre Rutgers
and Maryland show how‘ far
this program has fallen,
while blowout losses to West
Virginia (44-6) and Notre
Dame (52-21) further ampli-
fied the Panthers’ inability to
compete with formidable
opponents.

Whether it is the erratic

offense or the bend-and-
break defensive play, head
coach Paul Hackett has little
to be pleased with at the
midway point of the season.

‘TI can’t say I’m happy or
content with any play, ,with
anyone on" this team,”
Hackett said. “There are
areas that are playing pretty
well but certainly not where
I would say ‘Goodness gra-
cious, we’re getting it done.’

“We’re not getting it done.”

Here is a look at all.the
people involved with not

no points.

The Panthers may be rack-
ing up yardage (ranked sev-
enth nationally in total
offense with 472 yards per

College football fails to

By Michael C. Johns
Staff Writer

The history of African
Americans in college foot-
‘ ball is a long and glorious
one —— as long as those
African Americans are play-
ing the game and not coach-
ing it.

William H. Lewis of
Harvard became the first
African American from a
major collegh to achieve All-
American status in 1892 and
1893. Lewis was also the
first African American to
coach at a major college
when he coached the
Harvard offensive line
immediately after his gradu-
ation.

Almost 100 years have
passed and there have
only been two African-
American head coaches in
the history of major college
football. Currently there are
none.

In fact, African Americans
make up only 1.3 percent of
the assistant coaches in
major college football,
coaching 65 percent of all
Division I starting football
players who are African
American.

The road to becoming a

Division I-A head coach is a"

long one. For ‘African
Americans that have all the
qualifications,that
road often has many pot-
holes. There were 14 head
coaching vacancies going
into the 1992 season, and no
African Americans were

hired. ,

Ron Dickerson was on Joe
Paterno’s staff at Penn State
and now is the defensive

-coordinator at Clemson

University. Dickerson has

_the references and the nec-

essary experience, but he
cannot get employment as a
head coach.

“I applied for the head
coaching positions at major
colleges so many times I
thought about writing a
book entitled Not Qualified,”
Dickerson said. '

Dickerson said he has a
theory for why African
Americans are. not given a
fair chance to become head
coaches.

“First, there still is a ‘good
old boy network,’ and
African Americans are not a
part of it,” he said.
“Secondly, college presi-
dents need to get involved
in the hiring process. And
finally, a lot of money goes
into college football. The
older people [alumni] who
make large contributions to
the school still view African
Americans as people who
can’t do the job.” '

“A head coach needs to
be a commander,” said
Andy Giger, former Stanford
University athletic director.
“African Americans have
been caught in a Catch 22. It
is hard to demonstrate com-
mand if your not given a
chance. Racism maybe a
small part of it. Racism still
exists in America.”

when Van Pelt missed wide
open receivers for possible
touchdowns.

The past three weeks have
been AVP at his best —
throwing for 1,005 yards and
nine. TD passes in the
Minnesota win and losses to
Maryland and Notre Dame.
But therein lies the point:
‘The team is losing, Great
players should make winning
plays when the teaml needs

not, he hasn’t delivered.
GRADE: C+

BACKFIELD; Injuries aside,
the tailback trio of Curtis
Martin, Jermaine Williams
and Tim Colicchio have been
consistent runners, as adver-
tised. “The Razor” was poised
for a banner sophomore cam-

paign until a bruised Achilles"

tendon sidelined him.
Williams provided versatility
as‘ a runner, blocker and
receiver until a foot injury
put him on the shelf beside
Martin.

Colicchio has seized the
day, racing up 100-yard days
against Minnesota and
Maryland. He was blasting
away at Notre Dame before
being limited by a hip point-
er. That left Chad Dukes,
who did not do much dam-
age against an unimpressive
Irish D.

While the tailbacks are beat
up, the fullbacks are just
non—threatening blockers.
Vince Williams was the only
one who could produce, but
he is also out with an injury.
Carl Hagins and Bobby
Boykin have combined for

Billy Davis has provided
occasional explosiveness, but
please, no more hitch passes
to the sideline (remember
West Virginia).

The tight end spot has
been a disappointment. Rob
Coons has been touted as an
All-American candidate since
his arrival at Pitt. More like
the All-MASH team since he
cannot stay healthy. When he
is healthy, he drops too many
passes and never was a great
blocker. Dave Moore and Eric
Seaman, where are you? The
wide receiving corps
deserves an A, but the tight
end spot brings the grade
down. GRADE: B

LINE: Find someone who is’
not a good football player
here: Reuben Brown, Lawson
Mollica, Chris Sestili, Gary
Gorajewski and Mike LiVorio.
Maybe Mollica. This is a
group of solid players. Brown
is an oustanding player ,who
is going to be a quality pro-
fessional whether he stays
here or moves back to
defense. The problem is that
they have not jelled. More
than any part of the team, the
offensive line must mesh well
to produce, and it hasn’t.

“What has happened [with
our offensive line] is that
we’ve been erratic,” Hackett
said. “Early in the year, I
was disappointed, quite
frankly. In the last couple of
weeks, they have shown the
maturity that we need  par-
ticularly in the game against
Maryland.”

They are improving, but
halfway through the season is
a little late to be just getting
it together.

GRADE: B-

Overall, the inverse sum-of-
the-parts theory applies here.
Individually, this offense has
talent at ‘every position. It is
an experienced, explosive
group. It just hasn’t carried
the team the way,it was

Coaches  

Continued from page 9
When there is a head coach-

S ing vacancy, candidates are

"l

7?

usually either offensive or
defensive coordinators or
someone with prior Division I T
head coaching experience. One
of the reasons African
Americans have trouble filling
those vacancies is that there are
very few African-American"
coordinators in Division I foot-
ball.

“More African Americans
must get into the assistant
coaching ranks in Division I-A
football,”_ explained Dave
Maggard, Miami Hurricane ath-
letic director. “Schools must get
away from having just one
African-American assistant
coach. Schools that have multi-
ple African-American assistant
coaches show their commit-
ment to equal opportunity.”

Notre Dame Athletic Director

Richard Rosethal said‘ that as

more African Americans move
into prominent coordinator
positions, the opportunities for
head coaching positions will
also improve.

One of the few men to beat
that aforementioned “Catch 22”
is Dennis Green. ,

Green was hired as head
coach of the Minnesota Vikings
this year, after compiling a 16-
18 record at Stanford from

in 1989-91. Green is only the sec-

ond African American to ever
head a Division I—A football
program.

said that after an extensive
search, he was the‘ best candi-
date for the job —-.- so he hired
him. The color of his skin had
nothing to do with it.

“When I hired Green as the
head coach at Stanford there
was some protest, but nothing
alarming,” Giger said. “Green
had everything you need to be
a successful head coach. He
has excellent executive ability
and manages a football team
extremely well. Also he has
excellent outreach with alumni,
and he hires excellent people.
People are looking for quality
management capabilities.”

Coach Green is not the only
qualiﬁed African American who
can be a head coach. He just
was the second to get an
opportunity — opportunities
that don’t seem to come
around very often for African
Americans.

“I applied to many major col-
leges for the head coaching
position,” said William T.
Hayes, head coach of North
Carolina A& T. “I never got
hired, and only one school sent
me a statement. I was once told
by a university that I was the
best candidate, but to no avail.
Many African-American coach-
es feel it is hopeless.”

But even having all the right
credentials is not enough. To
land a_ head coaching job, one
must have outstanding refer-
ences. And that only happens if
one is lucky enough to have
served under a winner.

October 23

“There is no question that a
lot of head coaching jobs are
won by being associated with
quality people,” said Brian
Williams, Pitt’s outside line-
backer coach. “People listen to
the Paul Hackett types of the
world. When people go out to
hire people they take the word
of a Johnny Majors or a Joe
Paterno. They want to get a
name person to say how he
feels about that person’s ability
to be a head coach.’’ ’

South Carolina State (a
Division I-AA school) head
coach Willie Jefferies was

.,an assistant coach at Pitt under

Majors. Apparently his asso-
ciation with a winner paid off.
He_,_w_as* the first African
American tB"Bé a head coach at

a major college. Jefferies

coached at Wichita State from
1979—’82.

One of a head coach’s most»

valuable abilities is recruiting,
and African-American coaches
feel very confident that they
can recruit anyone — African
American or white.

“Young men want fairness,”
South Carolina State head
coach Willie Jefferies said.
“When I was the head coach at
Wichita State I only had one
white recruit tell me he
couldn’t play for an African-
American head coach.”

Former Pitt coaches Majors,
Sherrill and Jimmy Johnson
(now head coach of the Dallas
Cowboys) all got an opportuni-
ty to become a head coach at

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, October 14, 1992

Wales

Continued from page 9
many high moments for New
York — the acquisition of
league MVP Mark Messier, the
102 points scored by Norris
Trophy winner Brian Leetch
and the NHL’s best record in
the regular season.

Still, the Rangers realized
their all too familiar fate of not
winning the Stanley Cup,
which they have not won since
1940. Unfortunately for New
York fans, the Rangers will
once again fall short of win-
ning the cup.

The Rangers have the talent
at every forward position with
Messier, Mike Gartner, Tony
Amonte, Sergei Nemchinov,
Darren T urcotte, Adam Graves
and highly-rated rookie Alexei
Kovalev. New York also has
talent on the blue line with
Leetch and James Patrick. The
goaltending tandem of John

Vanbiesbrouck and Mike
Richter is the league’s best.

Along with their skill players,
the Rangers have their share of
blue collar players like newly
acquired left wing Phil
Bourque, left wing Kris King
and defensemen Joe Cirella,
Mark Hardy and Jeff
Beukeboom.

The reason the Rangers will
not win the Cup is not because
of their on—ice product. The
problem is the man behind the
bench, Roger Neilson. When
the competition gets tough,
Neilson takes out the competi-
tion, as evidenced by the take-
out of Mario Lemieux in last
year’s playoffs. Neilson also
isn’t the best of friends with
captain Messier and can’t man-
age his goalies correctly.
Unless he goes, the Rangers
won’t make it out of the divi-
sional playoffs come spring.

3)Pittsburgh Penguins

You may be wondering how
anyone could say that the two-
time defending Stanley Cup
champs are going to finish
third. The Pens take the regu-
lar season about as seriously as
you probably take my predic-
tions. Once the playoffs start,
look for a run at cup number
three.

The talent of the Penguins’
forwards is scary. Center Mario

Lemieux is the world’s best‘

(and richest) player, left wing
Kevin Stevens is the NHL’s pre-
mier power forward with right
wing Rick Tocchet rating not
far behind. If that line stays
healthy, look for 200 points
from .Lemieux and 100 each
from Tocchet and Stevens.
This will be right wing
Jaromir Jagr’s year to show if
he can play up to superstar
calibre for a full season. He

did that in last year’s playoffs.
If he comes close, the Pens
have the luxury of alternating
him and Tocchet on Lemieux’s
line. The second line will
include playoff hero Ron
Francis and either grinder Bob
Errey (who will miss the first
month of the season) or
speedy Shawn McEachern.
Also, injured right wing Joe
Mullen can play capably on
either of the top two lines
when he returns in November.

The blue line might not be
pretty, but it gets the job done.
The offense should come from
Larry Murphy and Bryan
Fogarty while Ulf Samuelsson,
Kjell Samuelsson, Jim Paek,
Paul Stanton, Grant Jennings
and Jeff Chychrun make up the
defensive defensemen.

In goal, Pittsburgh is solid
with clutch goalie Tom
Barrasso and reliable back—up

Ken Wregget.
4)New Jersey Devils

The Devils, like the Capitals,
have a team built on solid
defense. The only difference is
the Devils have a weak group
of forwards.

Defensemen Scott Stevens,
Alexi Kasatonov, Bruce Driver,
Slava Fetisov, Ken Daneyko
and rookie Scott Niedermayer
are solid. The problem is they
have only two bonafide goal

scorers at forward in Claude?)

Lemieux and Stephane Richer.
The Devils will be hoping that
newly acquired Bobby Holik
can score some goals, that the
sophomore jinx doesn’t hit
center Kevin Todd and that
John MacLean can come back
to his 40—goal form after miss-
ing a season due to injury.

In goal, Chris Terreri will be
the number-one goalie with

sive coordinator Nick Rapone
said all that mattered to him
was the number of points his
team gave" up. After six
games, the Panthers’ defense
has allowed 207 points — an
average of 34.5 per game.
That’s probably not what
Rapone had in mind. A total
yardage tally of 445.8 yards
per game doesn’t help either.

LINE: The Panthers’ platoon
fronts have been one of the
biggest factors behind Pitt’s
porous defensive play. Of the
two lines, the Matt I-Iosilyk,
Tom Barndt and Jeff Esters
trio has been the most prolif-
ic (if you could call it that),
accounting for all five sacks
recorded by Pitt defensive
linemen. As for the group of
Mike Halapin, Dave Kristofic
and Mike Kelly mark them
small, slow and unproduc-
tive. The less said, the better.

The Islanders are the team
on the rise in the Patrick
Division. They have a talented
group of forwards including
Pierre Turgeon, Derek King,
Ray Ferraro, Benoit Hogue,
David Volek and Steve

T A Thomas.

Their defense, which
includes Uwe Krupp, Torn
Kurvers and Scott Lachance, is
stronger this year with the
addition of Russian standout
Vladimir Malakhov and first-
round pick Darius Kasparaitis.

‘The goaltendingtandem of
Mark Fitzpatrick and Glenn
Healy may not be spectacular,
but its reliable.
6)Philadelphia Flyers

Will rookie Eric Lindros take
the Flyers back to the playoffs
after three straight years out.of
them? Not a chance. By acquir-

' "fing Lindros, the Flyers disman-

tled their defense and goal-
tending. Two rookie goalies,
Dominic Roussel and Tommy
Soderstrom, will try to take Ron
Hextall’s place along with
career back-up _Stephane
Beauregard, acquired last week
from Winnipeg. Roussel was
impressive for 17 games as a
back—up last year, but is he
ready (or able) to be the num-
ber one goalie?

The Flyers may have one of
the worst defenses in the NHL.

'”U’By trading offensive defense-

men Steve Duchesne and Kerry
Huffman, the Flyers now have
only Brian Benning as an
offensive defenseman.

The picture at forward isn’t
so bleak. Lindros will probably
center a line with Mark Recchi

and either Pelle Eklund (who is A

currently injured) or Rod Brind’
Amour. Kevin Dineen and free
agent acquisition Greg
Paslawski should also do some
scoring for Philadelphia.

Adams Division

1)Boston Bruins

Even though Cam Neely will
miss at least the start of the
season, the new, younger
Bruins should win the division.
Leading the Way -will be a
group of forwards including
gifted passer Adam Oates, vet-
erans Steve Leach and Vladimir
Ruzicka and young talent
including Joe Juneau, Ted
Donato, Glen Murray and num-
ber-one pick Dmitri Kvartalnov.
. On defense, Ray Bourque
will once again lead the way.
Other notable Bruin blue liners
include Glen Wesley, Don
Sweeney, Gord Murphy and
free agent acquisition Gord
Roberts.

Andy Moog will be Boston’s
man in the nets once again this
year.
2)Buffalo Sabres

Having a healthy Pat
LaFontaine for a whole season
should make the Sabres con-
tendeis come playoff time. If
LaFontaine had played a full
season last year, he would
have received serious MVP
consideration.

Along with LaFontaine, the
Sabres have a decent group of
forwards in Alexander Mogilny,
Dale Hawerchuk and Dave
Andreychuk while defensemen
Doug Bodger and Petr Svoboda
will be counted on to score
from the point. ‘

The goaltending job is up for
grabs. Newly-acquired al1—rook-
ie team selection Dominik
Hasek, Darren Puppa, Tom
Draper and Clint Malarchuk all
have a chance to be the num-
ber—one guy.

?;)Montreal Canadiens

The anemic offense of the
Canadiens should receive a
considerable boost with the
acquisitions of left wing
Vincent Damphousse from
Edmonton and right wing Brian
Bellows from Minnesota. Also,
new head coach Jacques
Demers vows to make the club

’ play a more offensive brand of

hockey, something the Habs
did not do during the Pat
Burns era.

Despite the new emphasis
put on offense, Montreal
should still play good defense.
Goaltender Patrick Roy is one
of the game’s best despite a
poor showing in last year’s
playoffs.
4)Quebec Nordiques

After years of finishing last in
the division, look for the
Nordiques to finally make the
playoffs courtesy of the Lindros
trade.

The deal that sent Lindros to
Philly will help Quebec more
this season than it will help the
Flyers. Ron Hextall (if healthy)
will be the number—one goalie,
Steve Duchesne and Kerry
Huffman will add life (and
points) to Quebec’s defense
and Mike Ricci will be the
number—two center behind star
Joe Sakic.' 

If Mats Sundin, Owen Nolan
and Valeri Kamensky all play
to their potential, Quebec
should {easily pass Hartford for
the final playoff spot in the
Adams.
5)Hartford Whalers

With the acquisition of goalie
Sean Burke, the Whalers may
improve over last year’s dismal
26-41-15 season. The only
thing is, they will not improve
enough to keep Quebec from
passing them.

Hartford will look for vast
improvement from John Cullen
and Pat Verbeek, both of
whom played well below
expectations last year. ‘

Hartford’s defense will be led
by Zarley Zalapski, recently
acquired Eric,Weinrich and
Steve Konroyd.
6)Ottawa Senators

Of the two expansion teams
this year, expect Ottawa to be
the worst. Unlike Tampa Bay,
which gathered some decent
defensemen in the expansion
draft, Ottawa picked up few
quality players. Ex-Whaler
goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz will
have his hands full behind a
pathetic defense that includes
another ex-\Vhaler, Brad Shaw.

The only notable forwards
are former Canadien Sylvain
Turgeon and ex-Devil Laurie
Boschman.

this unit. Perkins has come
through with an outstand-

part due to an early-season

Vernon Lewis has been

position. Playing with a

move, the Cleveland
Cavaliers picked up the
erratic Wilkins. Cleveland is
one of the top three clubs in
basketball right now, and
this move demonstrates a
comittment to winning.

Taking into consideration
the athleticism and defen-
sive prowess of Wilkins, this
is a solid move.

Wilkins plays Michael
Jordan tougher than 90 per-
cent of the guards in the
game.

The Detroit Pistons are a
mere shadow of their back-
to—back title days. Another
“Bad Boy” said bye-bye to
Motown when the Pistons
sent John Salley to the
Miami Heat for conditional
draft choices.

Olden Polynice will pick
up Salley’s minutes.

On Saturday they were

The Bullets, anticipating

Just on sheer talent, the
Timberwolves engineered
themselves a steal here,
with the mean court pres-

rookie Christian Laettner.

’I‘HE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, October 14, 1992

Williams is not Richardson
in terms of leadership and
stability but should be a
nice fit on a club starting
from ground zero.

The Pacers gave up talent,
but get Richardson, truly a
gem who should finally get
his due as one of the game’s
elite floor generals.

Mitchell is a role player
who will blend in rather
than demand the

ball., something the Pacers )1

need.

There were many more
player moves, too many to
discuss in one day. .

Significant others included
Portland signing free agent
Rod Strickland, San Antonio
trading for Dale Ellis and
the L.A. Lakers picking up
James Edwards and Sean
Higgins.

Ifthe season is half as
exciting as the summer, the
NBA’s popularity will con-
tinue to skyrocket.

Having-Magic back and
Shaq around can’t hurt.

was more uneasy than it had
been at Dawson Street -— peo-
ple shouting and jostling each
other, trying to tell the story.

"I know who it was. One of
them, his name’s George, he’s'
a football player,” a breathless
young woman said to the
police. “He said, ‘We’re not
done with them. After the
game, we’re coming back_.”’

One distraught and shirtless
guy said, “They all were sitting
here on our cars,” he said,
carefully enunciating his
words. “We asked his girlfriend
to get off. He went, boom,
right on my neck.”

His friends were trying to get

said. “With 98 percent of them,

listen. But there’s always the

Sometimes people will chal-

Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety police officers receive
520 hours of training, the same
as a city police officer. The 62
officers and supervisors within
the department are armed and
empowered to make arrests.

In spite of the disrespect
some people show to Wise, it
is obvious that he does not
take it all too seriously.
Occasionally, he said, he has a
hard time keeping a straight
face during confrontations with
students.’

“I enjoy working here, it’s
hilarious,” he said. “Sometimes
you got to earn your money,
but sometimes it’s funny.”

In any case, he did a good
job of keeping a straight face
when he arrived at Dawson
Street that night with three
other cars. He pulled out a
night stick, got out and joined
other officers who were ques-
tioning a group of about 20
excited people.

People were grouped togeth-
er on the sidewalk and leaning

“Well, almost a shooting,”
the one in the window said,
sounding let down.

As we passed, people yelled
out information, insults and
jokes. One said the injured
man had left three minutes ago
and another said the gun had
been a .38 Special.

Wise cruised the dark streets‘

slowly, questioning people on
the sidewalk as other city and
campus patrol cars passed.
After an unsuccessful search,
Wise stopped for a moment to
give a city officer the informa-
tion and then headed toward
Forbes Avenue, telling the dis-
patcher he was going back on
his beat.

Not a minute later the dis-
patcher broke in again, “Large
ﬁghthas been reported at 1141
North Dithridge.”

And we were off again,
speeding down Forbes Avenue
in the exhilarating rush of
ﬂashing lights and wind. Wise

passed the Cathedral and,

turned onto Dithridge in front
of the Carnegie Museum.

We had been on North
Dithridge earlier in the night
when Wise had given us a per-
sonalized tour of the area,
ranging from dark, warehouse
alleys behind the stadium to
the chancellor’s mansion. He
had surprised me by pulling
right in the driveway of the
mansion andlgliding around
back to show us the surpris-

“Just go home with the cam-
era, man,” he saidto Matt.

In one movement, Wise
turned around again, walked
back to the shirtless guy and
began crowding him like an
umpire with an unruly
ballplayer.

“Hey,” he said heavily. “I
don’t want none of that shit.
You don’t tell him to go home
with 3 camera.”

“You have a very good
point, officer,” one of the more
sober guys said. “Come on
Eric, let’s go inside.”

Eric, less confident when
confronted with Wise’s bulk,
finally let his friends pull him
back inside after a brief argu-
ment.

The crowd quieted down
and dispersed as Wise and the
others continued gathering
information about the incident.
A few disparaging remarks
were made about The Pitt
News, but things remained fair-
ly peaceable and the officers
were firm but not rude with
the mostly drunken students.

Soon it was midnight and
Wise’s shift was over. Heading
back to the station, Matt asked
him if the last half hour had
been typical for a night on the
beat. V

“That’s how it is sometimes,”
he said. “One after another all
night. You just have to take
them one at a time. Actually,
that’s when it gets fun.”

Brothers and Sisters get together
and stop the violence.
