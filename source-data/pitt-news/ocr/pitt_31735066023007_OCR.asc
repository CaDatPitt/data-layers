Jones Murder:

Suspect Lived

I a In Dorms *

The suspect in ‘the January_

murder of freshman Monica Renee
Jones allegedly violated university‘
housing regulations by sharing the
Tower A room’ of his girlfriend for
up to five weeks at ‘a time.

Sydney Brinkley, 24, of Phila-
delphia shared the room of his
girlfriend, Estelle Hill periodically
throughout the Fall term last year,
according to a report to the
Pittsburgh Press from a former
resident’s mother who wished to
remain unidentified.

vAccording to- the mother the

residents of the floor tried to “get ‘

him (Brinkley) out” by reporting

Despite Warnings

  Smokingviolations Continue* 

By BILL PAINTER

Despite an ‘order issued by the
University Health and Safety
Department, there always seem to
be someone eating, drinking and
smoking in classrooms.

While eating and drinking draw
few comments, about regulations

prohibiting munching on a candy .,

bar or sipping a can of pop, nearly

/everyone has something to say

about .the smoking taboo.

Understandably, the persons

most concerned with enforcing that
rule are university authorities.
“Smoking ‘is a fire hazard and
there shall be no smoking in
classrooms or auditoriums, This is
a policy of the university, listed in
the university safety manual,” said

A. Richard'Barnhart, manager of the
;‘3‘al8P_h9l<5~_~» A‘ healthand safetyjdepartment.

 

I shouldn’t smoke

 

E. Maxine Bruhns, director ‘of
the nationality rooms, said, ‘‘I am
concerned with keeping the nation-
ality rooms clean and in good
condition. We have posted two
signs within each room.”

“Any class,. after the second
violation of these rules, is not
permitted in the nationality
rooms,” she added.

. Professors seems to agree with
the no--smoking policy. _ Smokers
should have rights, but they
in a conﬁned
classroom. ‘.‘ It goes against ﬁre
laws, which are hard to enforce,”

-said Dr. Arlene Weiner of the’

English department.

“Smoking can also create a mess
that janitors shouldn’t have to
clean up,” she added, saying she.
believes smokingin class is on the ’
decline. “When I, walked intoone

I

 

i

of my classes this term no one was

smoking which surprised .me.”__ A
“As a smoker, sometimes I

resent not being able to smoke, but
it is a practical matter and I agree

with the policy,” said Dr. Thomas; -‘

department. “Besides, smoking is- 

an annoyance to non-smokers.” ,-

Susie Milvihill suggested adop-
ting a smoking section policy’.

“They (university officials)

should have one half of the
classroom designated for smok-

ers,” said the non-smoking fresh-

man.
- “I don’t smoke in class because

I don’t want to bother others, ” said .

junior Sandy Taylor. ,
Alan Gladish, a sophomorejwho
doesn’t smoke, said “Smoking
bothers“me when I'm trying to
learn. If I'm not concentrating,

Other internships may be ar-

A * ranged according to the student’s
_ interests, said Ms. Manning.

In order to participate in WCLA
and LEIP it is required to be
enrolled for at least twelvecredits
of independent study. , Pitt will
then pay the “administrative fee”
for the internship. Ms. Manning
said that if a student was receiving
financial aid, the aids could be used
to pay for credits earned while in
Washington or Harrisburg.

WCLA has leased an apartment
building which may be rented by
student interns.

Brad Holmes, an urban develop-

'ment student at Pitt who attended

the summer session said, “I
thought the housing was adequate.
It’s not bad at all,” He also said
that the apartment building had a
grocery store, bar, and pool.

Both internship programs spon-
sor seminars, assemblies, and
social activities throughout the
session. 3

nuisance of himself, “a former
resident said. -

According to the Press story
.IoAnn Woodsonvndirector of the
office of residence life said she
understood that “some of the
students in the Towers. had
registered complaints about Brink-
ley.” .

Woodson said criminal incidents
concerning Brinkley would have
been left to the campus police to
investigate.

' Campus Police Chief Charles
“Kurt” Graham would not com-
ment on the murder adding that his
department did not receive a single

complaint about “Brinkleys pre-
NT‘

sence in the residence halls.

“We had no information that he
was in the dorms at all until this
investigation got under way,”
Graham said. A

“Five days is the maximum
allowed for a guest,” Woodson
said. “But one of the problems
with that rule is that even when we
suspect someone is overstaying
their welcome, we would have to
watch the room all the time to
prove this,” Woodson said.

Jones, a freshman in the College
of Arts and Sciences, was a

resident‘ of North Philadelphia"

while Hill apparently ‘left school
last spring to reutrn to Philadelphia
to live with Brinkley in the
Overbrook section of Philadelphia.

Brinkley is being held without

ii/\DU/\T N6

bond for the murder-rape ‘of l-Iill’s
sister, Shelia, 15 and Kathryn
Johns, 27, a teacher who lived ﬁve
blocks from Brinkley. '

The Pittsburgh Press also
reported yesterday that Brinkley
attempted to hang himself in
Philadelphia's Homesburg Prison
with bedsheets Thursday morning
but was stopped by prison guards.

A warrant for Brinkleys arrest
was issued Aug. 31 after’ he
allegedly robbed and beat a female
Philadelphia hotel complex em-
ployee.

Pittsburgh homicide detective
issued a warrant for his arrest
Wednesday and expect him to be

- transferred to the city for arraign-

ment on the Jones murder charges

The Panamanian girl had been in school only a few

V days. When her teacher called on her to answer a

question, she said nothing. Her classmates laughed
at her whenshe failed to answer, and then the little
girl started to -cry. Because she was despondent, the
girl was placed in a class‘ for children with learning

problems, until someone discovered that her only
problemliwas inadequate knowledge of English.

Many people might believe that such incidents do
not happen much anymore. Since the federal ‘govern-

ment now requires that bilingual programs be .

provided for children who speak English poorly, it is
natural to assume that local school districts have
become sensitive .to the special problems of the
Hispanic, Vietnamese, and other non-English
speaking pupils in their schools. That is not the case,
however, if one looks at California as an example,

Numerous court cases in California hav_e
challenged the placement of _too many Hispanic
children in special classes for the retarded. These
children are placed in the classes because they score
poorly on standardized tests written in English. As a
result, those children who have a poor command of
English are put‘ in special classes when they are not
retarded. The situation has been found to be so bad
that in one San Francisco school eighty percent of the
Hispanic children in a class for the retarded scored
classes. ' _ '

School systems in the United States have tried to
solve the problem‘ by translating traditional English’
IQ tests into Spanish- This approach to the

/

v Page 6——Monday, September 17, 1979

problem has been successful only partially because
many English cultural biases are translated into the
Spanish. For example, some IQ tests might ask a
child whether he associates coffee with milk, bread or
ice cream. The expected answer from an American
child is milk, but Puerto Ricans would answer bread
because heavily sweetened coffee and bread is a treat
to the children of the island. Again, the child is
judged incorrectly because he is not a part ..of the
dominant Anglo/ culture.

The real solution to the problem is to staff all
schools in the United States with‘ instructors capable
of teaching bilingual classes in both Spanish and
English. But, since Congress in 1968 ordered that all
schools provide bilingual education for non-English
students, local schools have not been able to find
competent teachers able to teach bilingual classes,

and the requirementfor bilingual programs has been -

waived in many areas. _
e To make sure Hispanic and other non-English
speaking children receive ‘the adequate education

they are owed, Pitt, and other collegesand univer-l_
sities, must act to see that their education programs

and language programs make a special effort to train

, bilingual teachers... ' If the United Statesyis to remain

the land of equal opportunity, educators must act
quickly; Hispanics are quickly becoming the largest
minority in the United States, and all public schools
in the nation are going to need bilingual teachers if
schools are to provide free education we have given
to all residents of this country since the days of
Horace Mann.

Why must the majority of movies,

I propose that movies and ﬁlms

Panthers Romp Over Kansas,24-0,

3“:

 

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer '
The Pitt Panthers passed their
ﬁrst test, but the jury still may be
out as to‘ what’s in store for the

entire course,_ meaning the rest of-

the 1979 football season.

Pitt was very impressive Satur-
day in its 24-0 shut out of the
Kansas Jayhawks. It was, to use
an old cliche, a true team effort,
with the offense using a balanced
attack to roll» up 365 total yards, and
the defense‘d‘oing’its usual superb
job, limiting Kansas to a mere 28
yards rushing. All this, plus the
fact that several key starters were
missing on defense and many
players were starting for the ﬁrst
time.

The gameistated out slowly, with‘

neither teamableto generate ‘much
offense. The J ayhawks fumbled on
their ﬁrst two plays from scrim-
mage, ‘ managed to maintain
possession, -but were forced to
punt. .

After Fred Jacobs fumbled over
to Kansas after picking up a first
down, the Jayhawks began to move

’ the ball well. Kevin Clinton threw

effectively, but his” team stalled.

Near the end of the ﬁrst quarter,-

Pitt began to move on the Hawks,
largely due to the play of fullback
Randy McMillan, who rushed for

» over 80 yards in theﬁrst quarter,

and quarterback Rick Trocano, who

served notice that he’s not yet.
ready for permanent duty on the-

bench.

The drive was halted deep in
Kansas territory, so kicker Mark
Schubert was summoned from the
sidelines to boot a 24-yard ﬁeld
goal, giving Pitt a 3-0 lead. -

The Panther defense ‘held

I Kansas without a first down on the

subsequent series, and the Pan-
thers took over on their own 33.

After "Trocano threw for three ﬁrst
downs, Pitt had the ball ﬁrst and
ten on the‘Kansas 20. From there,
the junior quarterback threaded the
needle to Ralph Still in the near

Ralph Still (here catching one got his three touchdown passes) was one of
several pleasantly surprising players Saturday. -

I. A ‘

‘corner of the end zone for Pitt’s

first touchdown of the season. It
was the first of three TD receptions
for Still, a ﬁve-year man who was
one of the most pleasant surprises
Saturday afternoon. 

Once again, the Panther defense
stiffened, and Hubach’s punt was‘
returned by Terry White’ to "the

Coach Jackie Sherrill then
inserted freshman quarterback Dan .

Marino, who proved he isn’t shy. ‘

about throwing the ball. His ﬁrst
toss, however,'9was intercepted by
Wattalet, who gsnuck in front of
ﬂanker Kenny Bowles in the end
zone.’ ./ ' -'

The Jayhawks reciprocated the
gift when Sydney fumbled on the
next play, and Hugh Green
recovered on the 23. .

On second down," Marino sprint-

fled to hissleft, threw back to his’

right, to Still at the 5, who bounced
away from a tackler and scampered
into the end zone for a touchdown,
aided by a crunching block from
tight end Benjie Pryor. The first
half ended with the Panthers
leading 7-0. 1

Midway through ‘the , third
quarter, Pitt took possession
around the midﬁeld stripe, and
began a49-yard drive which took
only five plays. The big play came
on second and 17 from the Pitt 44
when Trocano dropped back, and
ﬁred across the middle to Pryor,
who showed great agility as he
raced to the Kansas 24 for a first
down. One play later, Trocano hit
Stilldown the left sideline for the
last touchdown of the afternoon,
the play covering 23 yards.~

All that remained" after the
conclusion of the third quarter was
the show put on by the defense:
The J ayhawks threatened to score
several times, but were thwarted
each time, either by their own
mistakes, or by big plays from the
Panthers. '4
Early in the fourth quarter, the

four on the Pitt seven. Clinton .took 6

immediately hit by Jim Covert, and
fumbled the ball over to linebacker

but was stopped by a touchdown-

Rick Trocano’ was old, Dan
Marino was new, Randy McMillan
was borrowed, and Kansas’ lifeless
offense was turning blue.

And so it went Saturday in Pitt’s
season-opening 24-0 wipeout of the
outclassed Jayhawks. Jackie
Sherrill’si troops _ easily stormed
past the embarrassment of the

- proud Big 8 Conference,‘ and in so

doing let a cat named McMillan out
of the bag. This cat is 6-1, 225
‘pounds, and in one quarter
Saturday established himself as the
most irreplaceable Panther and th
key to the .1979 season. '

On his way to 141 yards on 21
carries, the junior college transfer
from Maryland bulled his way for
84 ﬁrst-quarter yards and‘, ran for
nine big ones the first time he
touched the ball in a major college
game.

"I think we found us la little

I running back-' who can ‘play,”

Sherrill said afterthe game.

Right, and Godzilla-A was just a .
little lizard who could eat most of
Japan. ,' I ‘ '

Remember last year when every
time Pitt faced a third-down-and-
short-yardage situation you closed’
your eyes and prayed. You can use
your prayers for something else
this year, like petitioning the
patron saint of fullbacks that
McMillan lasts the season unhurt.

‘Yes’, he appears to be that good.
And he knows it too. I

‘‘I’d say it was a job pretty well
done. but I could do better than I
did," McMillan said evaluatinghis
ﬁrstvperformance. ‘

“The guys (in major-college
football)‘ are a lot bigger and

‘ quicker, but I guess I'll have to

adjust...I’m pretty surexl can do
thisvall the time.” «

A large amount of McMillan’s
success must be attributed to the

it right side of Pitt’s line, featuring

guard Jim Morsillo, tackle Mark

May and; at times, tight "end Benjie
Pryor. I It was, to use the
vernacular, Blowout City.

- “May and Morsillo did a great
job of blowing them off the line of
scrimmage." Sherrill said. “I was

There are others who should

Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor
The Pitt volleyball Pantherettes
are enjoying all the luxureis of a

A big-time volleyball school, includ-

ing excellent competition on their
West Coast tour. ‘

Pitt began the tour with a

scrimmage against Souther Cali-
fornia, then traveled to Brigham
Young's Hawaii campus for a two
match set. ‘ .
_ ' Athough- no official score was
kept ' against USC, coach Mike
Herbert said the two-time national
champions defeated Pitt in all five
games.

“The team really enjoyed the
large crowds,” said Hebert,
“even though we were the visiting

-team. It's a real psych-up.”

According to the coach, there is a
phenomenal amount of interest in
volleyball in Hawaii, even on the

 

“The interest level is so high,”
he said, “that the first night we
were here,t here was a special on
TV about the Hawaii team.”

 The Pantherettes split the'series

with BYU, winning the first match‘

15-9, 15-10, 15-13.. They lost the
second, 15-12, 15-13, 12-15, 15-8.

“BYU was really ﬁred up,” said
Hebert. “They're not considered
very strong by Hawaiian standards,
but back east, they'd be up in the
"top five.”

I Hebert lauded the play of Paula
Olsen, Andra Pletz and freshman
Ellen Mangus, who is starting as a
hitter. He "also said the freshmen
have seen action and everyone is
playing a solid game. V

"‘The trip is ‘exactly what I
expected, including the tough
teams,” said Hebert. “We should

Among the other so-called
luxuries the team is enjoying are
large crowds, hoards of reporters
and great local interest. Hebert
said the crowds at BYU were
upwards of 1,000 each night.

“Still, the biggest difference
between the East and West is the
quality of high school programs,”
said the coach. “There is prestige

Pantherette Spikers Find Going Toughon West Coast  

for the kids there to compete.
Volleyball is very much a large part
of the entire sports scene here.”

Hebert later added that Pitt is
playing tough and not backing
down at all.

“But,” he said. “It’s a hell of an
adjustment and we're ﬁghting just
to keep_our heads above water.”

Spiker’s Notes—Pitt played
Hawaii-Hilo late last night and
results were not ‘available at press
time...After a second match with
Hilo tonight, the Pantherettes will
move on to the University of
Hawaii, third in ‘last year’s
national, for a two-match set, and
then on to the San Diego State
Invitation...Pitt now has a 1-1
record.

“I really didn’t know when I
would go in,” Marine said later. “I
guess it shows he has conﬁdence in
me.”

The freshman also made the
freshman mistake of throwing into
crowds,_ but showed promise of
living up to his billing as the

There were some low points to
the afternoon, like the offense
lagging in the second half and the
defensive backfield displaying
some holes. Although Kansas as a
team is slower than a parade of
three-leggedi camels, Jayhawk
receivers were very open on many
of Kevin Clinton’s 17 completions.
Despite Sherrill’s protests to the

speed would probably give the‘

backfield all it could handle.
But, above all, it was an

afternoon to get acquainted with .

Randy McMillan. And if Jackie
Sherrill is anything of
a movie buff, he is .probably
thinking of the final line of
Humphrey Bogart’s “Casa-
blanca.”

F , .

There were plenty of heroes in Pitt’s 24-0 whom- i

ping of Kansas at Pitt Stadium two days ago, but
three players in particular deserve special attention
becuase of the way they performed.

A All summer long, people were concerned about.
Pitt’s ‘passing attack. Sure, the‘ coaches had

‘ promised to open up the attack, but did they have the

players capable of throwing and catching the ball?

If Saturday’s game was an indication of things to
come, Pitt has little to worry about as. far as the
Dassing‘ game goes.

Rick Trocano, Benjie Pryor and Ralph Still all had
excellent games, and these were three, players who
Pitt needs to get good performances from if this team
is thinking about amajor bowl appearance. '

At game’s start, Trocano appeared a bit jittery,
but soon overcame his anxiousness and displayed as
poise and throwing arm not heretofore seen. Tro-
cano was quick to credit his teammates for his fine

” showing, too.

“I thought the team as a whole, came together
today. I think you saw that,” said Trocano.
“I think that was part of our great success offen-
sively, we struck to our game plan.”

Another aspect of the Pitt offense that was under a
great deal of scrutiny was the offensive line, but they.
too were impressive. '

. Trocano spoke of the linemen at the game’s post
game press conference, commenting “I’m so proud
of them.” '

“When the linemen up front and the backs are-

doing their job, it makes my job a lot easier.”

One of those backs who makes Trocano’s. job‘
easier is Randy McMillan,‘ who could be the best big
fullback Pitt will ever have. “When we need those
tough one, two or three yards, we can ‘go to Randy,”
Trocano said with a grin.

Pitt has been blessed with some great tight ends
over the years, particularly in the past decade, and
Benjie Pryor showed the 41,000 plus that he is ready

to join the line which includes Joel Klimek, Jim Cor-g

bett and Steve Gaustad. Ulike those three, Pryor has

und in Saturday’sJaywalk Through Kansas

an extra dimension—speed. The Panthers have‘had I

sure-handed tight en'd_s,'but never one who could_be
considered a breakaway threat in the openfield.

“His size. certainly gives us a tight end who can do
several things,” Sherrill said after the game. He add-
ed that Pryor and Mark May give Pitt a pretty form-
idable tackel and tight end combination, one capable
of opening some big holes in any defensive front.

" The most pleasant surprise Saturday had to be I

Still. ‘ Despite his_own confidence in his ability,
many skeptics felt he was no more than an adequate
receiver. ._ * ‘ I

But Saturday, the senior caught more touchdown
passes than he had in his entire career at Pitt, one
which is in its fifth year. With Julius Dawkins an
outstanding prospect, andVCliff Moore and Keith
Williams adding depth, the receiving, corps could
turn out to be one of Pit-t’s bright spots.

Thus, the Panthers are off to a good start in ’79,
and next Saturday’s ‘game at North Carolina.
Is Pitt as» good'_as Saturday’s performance? Or was

Kansas thatbad?

If Rick Trocano, Benjie Pryor and Ralph Still can
play the way they did Saturday, the Panthers may be
spending the holidays in Miami or New Orleans.

Q

Pitt Fourth in ‘Eight’  

By JEFF DUROSKO .-

Asst. Pitt ‘News Sports Editor

The Panther tennis team took to
the courts for the ﬁrst time this

season and came away from, the ’
' Eastern Eight Tournament with an

impressive fourth place ﬁnish.
Impressive, because although
the team is playing without the
services of Tom Liebenguth (now
with the soccer team) and Mark
Riley (who transferred), Pitt was

able to improve upon last year’s '

sixth-place ﬁnish.

“I _took the ‘team to the
tournament not expecting a whole
lot,” said head coach George
Dieffenbach. “I was really
surprised and have to give the guys
a whole lot of credit.”

George Washington won the
tournament with 62 points, West

Virginia was second with’ 55,-

Rutgers third with 47 and Pitt
fourth with 45.

Kevin Quay was a standout for
the Panthers according to the
coach, reaching the ﬁnals in
number one singles, before losing
to Rutgers’ Tom Chacko, 1-6, 6-1,

6-4. Chacko_ was the tournament’s
top-seed. .

Quay, unseeded, defeated
number-two seed Dave Schoen of
GW in the first round, 1-6, 7-5,
6-4. ' In the second round, Quay
upset third-seeded George Veronis
of West Virginia, 6-4, 6-2.

“Kevin did a great job,” said
Dieffenbach. “He really went after
Chacko, and Chacko had to hustle
to beat him.” '

In other singles action, Dave~

Romito also reached the ﬁnals

' before falling to GW’s Josh Ripple,

7-6, 7-5, in the ﬁnal. Ripple was
the top‘ seed in his bracket.

Chuck Brand lost his first-round
match to his _b‘racket’s number-one
seed, butcame back to win the
consolation tournament. He

defeated Shawn Friel of Villanova,

6-3, 6-4. p
Also, Joe Mayers wound up
second in the consolation bracket of
number four singles, Doug White
won his ﬁrst-round match and then
lost, and Kim Roberts did the
same. ’ ’

  Bemis’ Boaters Bow Again, Lose 1-ot0‘GroveCIty

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writt:

There seems to be a black cloud
shadowing the 1979 soccer team
this fall. In a match Friday with
Grove City College, the Panthers
lost their second game in three
days by a 1-0 score. Earlier in the
week powerful Akron defeated. Pitt
on a goal with eight seconds left.

Friday's game against the
Wolverines was dissimilar to the
Akron contest. ,The Wolverines’
goal came at 24:43 of the ﬁrst half,

but in the 65 _remaining minutes,

Pitt failed to score. Pitt outshot the
Wolverines 16-14.

Starting right wing Jerry Buirge,
who alternates with Barry Stein,
believes the problem is that the
three Pitt lines aren’t working
together. -

“We aren’t moving up and down
the field as unit,” said Buirge.
“We just aren’t working together
asoa whole team.” Instead, “We
are moving as three separate
lines——the frontline, the midﬁeld
section, and then the fullbacks.
This problemicauses the front line
to be left alone when they are
-comingdownﬁeld on a drive, and it
ends up being three men on six.”

The Wolverine goal came when

A Bucs Bring Out the Best in Mets, Lose 3-0; Expos Win

By The Associated Press

The Pittsburgh .Pjrates brought
out the best in the last-place New
’York Mets again here yesterday.
And New York’s 3-0 victory cost the
Pirates their half-game lead in the
National League East.

“We play Pittsburgh tough,”
Pete Falcone said after earning
only his sixth pitching victory
against 13 defeats for the Mets.

“I think it's because they’re a
contender and we try to be a
spoiler,” he added. “It's a
psychological thing. ’You try that
much harder.”

The pirate loss, coupled with
Montreals’ doubleheader split with
St. Louis, boosted the Expos ahead
of Pittsburgh with a .604 winning
percentage. The Pirates are at

/, .603.

Something will give tonight
when the Pirates play the Expos in
Montreal to open a two-game
series there. The Expos face four
games in Pittsburgh the last week
of the season.

“It will go down to the wire,”
said Pirate Manager Chuck Tan-
ner.

“Usually when you're 30 games
over .500 you can get ready for the
playoffs. But our situation isn't
frustrating. We’re in a pennant
race. Montreal is doing the job.
We’re doing the job. And it’sjust a
great race.“

The Mets are at the bottom of the
divison with a 56-89 record, but
they finished their season series
with Pittsburgh with eight victories
against 10 losses.

“They played us as tough as
anybody in baseball,” said
Tanner. ‘‘I think Joe Torreglas
done a tremendous job with their
ball club. He's kept them ﬁghting
all the way.”

Falcone got ninth-inning relief
from Neil Allen, and Dan Norman
hit a solo homer for the Mets.

The Pirates advanced only two
runners beyond second base and
got only seven hits off Falcone and

Allen.

The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the
ﬁrst inning when Elliott Maddox
doubled off loser John Candelaria,
14-9, and scored on a single by Lee
Mazzilli.

With two out in the New York
fourth, Norman drove a pitch from
Candelaria over the leftﬁeld wall
for his second homer of the season.

The Mets had added their final
run in the eighth when Mazzilli
singled off Kent Tekulve and Joel

,Youngblood doubled him home.

In the Pittsburgh ninth, Lee Lacy
led off with a single to right.

After Falcone fell behind with a
2-0 count ori"‘Bill Madlock, he was
replaced by Allen, whose first two
pitches were wide of the plate to
put Madlock at first and move Lacy
to second. ' ..

But pinch-hitter Mike Easler
forced Madlock at second, then
pinch hitter Willie Stargell bounced
into a double play to end the game.

Robinson will pitch for Pitsburgh

“I hope we can cool them off,
which I think we 'will,” said
Robinson, 7-6 this season.

‘‘I’d definitely go to see this
game tomorrow night if I was a fan
in Montreal,” he added. “I heard
it’s sold out already. That’s what
they said on the radio last night

Bahr’s ﬁeld goal capped a

The outcome left Pittsburgh with
a 3-0 record and dropped St. Louis
to 1-2. In winning, the Steelers
overcame two interceptions and
two losses of fumbles which helped
