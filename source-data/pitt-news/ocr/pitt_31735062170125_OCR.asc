UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

FRIDAY, MAY I6, I96:

Soy Something, It Is Your Right  

Say something. Anything.

Tell your advisor that you want to
change your major. Tell your parents that
you want to design your ownmajor. Tell
your teacher that he isn’t making the class
any better for his presence.

Tell your fellow students that the myths
about "it being a privilege to attend col-
lege," and “students have no voice in how
the University is run, and “if you don't like
it here you can leave” are a bunch of 1930
bullshit.

Stand up and fight for what is right-
fully yours. Don’t be lured into believing
the crap about the “majority rule” or

“representation” or any of those other

words used to put students off in a corner
while someone (no one seems to know ex-

_ actly,who)' determines the polic_y_,of'jyour "
,U!Ii_v‘e_rsity- '1' ’   « ' ' T

   

 
   
 

   

During the past year a small group of
students and faculty have been working to
improve conditions here for you. The time
has now come for you to stand up, without
fear of a cop hitting you on the head or
some administrator putting a little black
mark on your records, and say what you
want about your education.

You pay tuition. You attend classes.
You will eventually graduate and work

somewhere in this city, state, or country,.

and these places will be benefiting by the
knowledge you have attained here. Know-
ledge. Not QPA, transcript, fraternity,
sorority. club. activity. Knowledge. Your
knowledge. Your education.

So how do you improve your educatio_n?

Forget about majors, requirements,
and distribution for a minute and think
about what courses you want to take. For-
get about grades and social pressures for
a minute and think about the courses you
want to take.

Now, if the courses you would like to
take differ from those you must take’ or
those you have been forced to take, for a
number of reasons already mentioned,

there is something grossly wrong with-

your academic situation. You have wasted,
or are wasting, your time and your money.
But whose fault is that? _

-ears ago you could have blamed it on
the system, the administration, society, or
a number of other things. Today, right now,
the fault is yours. That’s right. '

allow students the maximum academic 1. -
freedom. Students actually decide what, W

they want to study with no grades, no re-

and administrators at those schools woke

up one day and said, “Let’s let the students
decide for themselves” ?

Of course not. The ‘students didn’t wake;

up one day and say, “Let’s decide our own
futures” either. But they did think about
it for a long time and finally decided thatit
was their right as students to decide their
futures.

It would be impossible for all students V 
here to wake up one day and realize it is,

their right to decidetheir academic fu-

tures. Hopefully, after reading pages four: . .

Is there oz connection?

IN PRAGUE

The Soviet Army marches in,
students defy Soviet tanks, but
censorship and thought control
are reimposed.

IN MOSCOW

Sinyafsky and Daniel and
thousands of Russian intellec-
tuals are sent to Siberian labor
camps or committed to asy-
lums by a regime that seeks to
stifle all voices of dissent.

FROM CHINA

The Red Chinese Army con-
quers Tibet, practices genocide,
and then is launched on an un-
provoked attack against India.

ON THE AMERICAN
CAMPUSES

Extremists man—handle profes-
sors, burn libraries, seize and
vandalize buildings, and create
a climate of intolerance and
anti-intellectual terror.

IN VIETNAM
Thousands of teachers and
civic leaders are murdered by
the Viet Cong while a strug-
gling underdeveloped country,
seeking to improve the quality
of life, finds itself under,as-
sault by an ideology that
would deny freedom to all men.
It is our belief that there is

a connection between all of
these developments. The places
are different, the circumstances
vary, but the phenomenon of
totalitarian aggression against
freedom is the same.

The Vietnam war has been
widely misunderstood because
of the tendency to View it in
isolation. This war assumes a
clear and compelling signifi-
cance, however, when it is
viewed in its global context ——
when it is seen as an integral
part of a world-wide struggle
by the forces of total tyranny
against‘ the human mind and
the free spirit of man.

Over the coming critical
months of the Paris peace
talks, some of those who op-
pose our Vietnam commitment
will do everything in their
power to compel the Adminis-
tration to scuttle and run so
that the Communists can take
over there. This imposes a duty
on all of us, liberal and con-
servative, who are committed
to an honorable peace, to make
our voices heard.

If you believe as we do, and
if you want to do something
about it, either as an individual
or as a leader of a student or-
ganization, please write to

s-ruoem

by DAVE TIERN AN , Editor

If you starve achild from birth, feeding it only
enough to exist, he will come to feel that his bits and

pieces of food are rewards.

If you stuff a,child from birth, feeding it some-
thing everytime it cries, laughs, or turns its tiny
head, it will come to hate food and the thought of

eating.

In my mind, the academic situation here is sim-
ilar to both situations. On one hand, students have
been force-fed so much crap about education from
the time they entered school until now that they hate
the thought of school, and only go because they have

to (like eating to stay alive).

On the other hand, students have been starved of

- their rights as students for so long, they feel that
any little token voice is a reward. Looking over
. these pages, many students will say, “Wow, we

really have it pretty good.”

Look at what you have. Think about what you
should have or could have. Why are there grades,
requirements, and majors? Why are all classes
taught in the rigid surroundings of a classroom?
Why will students have either a token voice or no
voice at all in the selection of a new,.dean of the Fac-

ulty of arts and Sciences?

Because some students have been force-fed to
such an extent that they just don’t give a damn
about anything except getting out of here, and the
others jump up and rejoice over every piecemeal
act to give students a voice in the determination of
their education. We’re the babies, and according to
Frued, our personalities are shaped and_we’ll never

change. I agree.

Exchange Courses

Students at five Pittsburgh universities
and colleges will be able to enroll in cour-
ses at institutions other than their own un-
der’ a new program which emphasizes
academic enrichment.

The program was suggested by the Pitts—.

burgh Council of Higher Education, a lo-
cal organization dedicated to improving the
quality of education in this area. Cross-
registration will be open to juniors and
seniors this fall term. ’

_ Upperclass students at the Univer-
sity will be able to take one class per term
at Chatham College, Duquesne Univer-
sity, Mt. Mercy College, and Carnegie-
Mellon University.

Full credit and a grade will be given for
each course. Each student’s transcript

will note that the course was taken at an- —

other school.

Some students may have to re-register

‘ ' if they wish to take advantage of this pro-

gram, since many upperclassmen have al-
ready registered for the fall term. There
is a new cross-registration form that will
have to be completed.

Self Designed Major

Students in the College of Arts and
Sciences can now design their own majors
if they fulfill the requirements set up by the
Undergraduate Council. The program be-
came available to qualified students be-
ginning with the last Winter Term. The
requirements are as follows:

1. The student must have a minimum of 58
credits, at the end of the terms, but he
should not have more than 75 credits at
the end of his second term as a junior.

2. The student must be in good academic
standing at the time of his application.

3. The student must write a justification of
his proposed self—designed major, and for-
ward it to a faculty advisor who will en-
dorse it and send it to an appointed com-

mittee. This same advisor will then di- '

rect the students program and register
his each term.

4. The students major must involve at least
three departments, with a minimum
of fifteen credits‘. The student's senior

year must include an integrative depend-

ent study project approved and direct-
ed by the faculty advisor.

The major also must be sufficiently dif-
ferent from existing majors to qualify un-
der the program. Due, to the limited re-
sponse, ,the approval committee has .not
been appointed and students must submit
their proposeds to the Dean of the College.

Institutionalized interdepartmental ma-
jors are now in the planning stage, includ-
ing majors in “Urban Civilization” and
“Communitations.” The Undergraduate
Council, which approved the Program,
consists of representatives from depart-

.ments of the College and from the student

Liberal Arts Cabinet.

In designing separate majors, students
may need special courses by appoint-
ment with an individual instructor.to ful-
fill the major’s requirements. '

To do this, a student must speak with the

instructor and get his okay. Usually, the

special courses are set-up by appointment
with the instructor.

‘ Forthe sp/ecial course. a program (con-
sisting of readings, interviews etc.) must
be drawn up, and submitted to the Dean of
the College.

Distribution Load Reduced

The Faculty of ‘the Arts and Sciences
has approved changes in the curriculum
requirements for students in the College.
These changes will apply to all students
currently enrolled in the College and be‘-
came effective this term.

The Distribution of Studies require-

ment has been modified so that only nine .

credits are required in the three areas of
study, but the three department rule re-
mains in effect. Also, an .interdiciplin-
ary course may be substituted, as under the
present regulations, for a departmental
course in meeting this requirement. Stu-
dents may elect any course for which they

have met the stated departmental pre- '

requisite.

Any courses other than English 1-2,
Languages 1, 2, 3, 4. 10, and 11. as well as
P.Ed. 1-2 or 90 or 190 courses will count
toward DOS in the respective area.

Language 4 Alternatives

Alternative courses can now be sub-
stituted for the usual language level four.
These courses have been selected by the

' various language departments as accep-

table for substitution.

1. If the student has already taken one of
the alternative courses - the require-
ment will be considered met.

.Normally the student "will take the al-
ternative course during the term in which
he would take the language level four.
The college has, however, recognized
the problems of prerequisites and sche-
duling and has only stipulated that the
course be taken before graduation.

3. Students who have already registered
for the fall term and wish to change to
one of the approved alternative courses
should wait until they have received
their fall schedule and before contact-
ing their respective advisors about the
‘change. '

4. If a student elects to take the alterna-
tive course on a Satisfactory/Unsatis-

factory basis, it will not count against his
total allowed eight S/ U courses.

N

Satis.factory/
Unsatisfactory Grades

Starting this spring, students are permit-
ted to _take one course which will be graded
either Satisfactory of Unsatisfactory. This
does not include the courses in the stu-
dent’s major or related area. To use the
S/ U option, students should go to the Deans’
office, 917 CL, and receive an S/U card
upon request and presentation of a Vali-
dated academic invoice. ‘ .

The card should be presented to the
course instructor before final exam. Ar-
rangements for S/Ugrading for a language
1-_2-3-4 course should be made directly
with the instructor.

An S grade will represent an A, B, or C
grade with credit towards graduation, but
the  grade will represent a D or F and
credit will not be given for the course. Nei-

ther S nor _U will be used in computing the
student’s QPA. _

RIGHTS

Special to The Pitt News

by SCOTT BAUM, Student Government President

During this past year, change has become commonplace in the Univer-
.sity. But, the changes accomplished this-past year have, in reality, merely set a
fertile groundwork for the changes of this coming academic year. For the sake of
clarity, let me say that" the term “change” refers only to constructive change.
It is the nature of the University to incessantly discuss its mission programs and
methods in an effort to allowstudents the greatest range of options in order to
accomplish their educational and social goals. Thus it should not be misconstrued
that we are in the business of change for the sake of change or for the mani-
pulation of power, but rather for the -fulfillment of those students willing to
commit themselves to working toward an academic _COMMUN|TY. '

After that auspicious, and possibly au-
dacious, beginning, I will ennumeraté
some of the more salient changes we have
made by means of, or within, Student Gov-
ernment in the recent past. Some of these
programs are still being put into action,
and all are, of course, subject to review
and change as becomes necessary. I have
inserted some -which are only in the plan-
ning stages, to give a feeling for the direc-
tion in which Student Government is mov-

mg’ The Legal Wareness
Committee

The Legal Awareness Committee has
become firmly established under the chair-

manship of Sy Adler. A lawyer, on retain- ‘

er, is available to students all year thorugh.
the committee, which is also engaged in the
compilation and publication of legal infor-
mation pertaining to drugs, the draft, sex
laws and other areas close to students’
hearts. More important is the work done to
create a viable judicial system composed
primarily of students. A proposal had been
submitted for the establishment of an ap-

3 pellate court comprised of faculty and stu-

dents, which will also have original and
final jurisdiction in academic cases. Pend-
ing approval by the Faculty Senate, the
court will be insituted as will, hopefully,
an overall undergraduate court to handle
all judicial action not handled specifically
by dorm boards.

The work in areas such as judicial sys-

tems typifies the attitude of self-aware- ‘

ness that is becoming obvious on campus.

The image of the “student as nigger” is be- -

ginning to tarnish rapidly, at least as far
as internal University affiars are concern-

ed. 

In order to avoid confusion, the Facul-
ty of Arts and Sciences and the Faculty
Senate are not the same. The Senate is
composed of faculty and administrators
from the University as a whole, the Facul-
ty of Arts and Sciences is, as its names de-

notes, only faculty from the College of Arts ‘

and Sciences and its jurisdiction is over
that school only. The importance of the co-
dification of by-laws for, and the legitimiz-
ation of, the FAS to students is that a me-
chanism is provided for formal change
within the college which affects, ultimately,
all undergraduates who study at the Uni-
versity.

Undergraduate Council

Through a concerted effort of some fac-
ulty and students. student voting represen-
tation was increased to five members on
the Undergraduate Council. The appoint-
ment of the new Dean of the College, who
is very interested in experimentation and
change, is at least partially a response to
the tenor on campus. which is calling for.
constructive change. Some programs are
in the offing to extend this student involve-
ment to the departmental level in those
departments where it does not already
exist.

Curriculum Review
Committee

Following a nationwide trend on cam-
puses, a curriculum review committee has
been set up, mostly the work of the past
chairman of the Liberal Arts Cabinet, Joe
Kociubes. This committee, under the chair-
manship of David Bramhall, will indulge-
in one year of fact-finding and analyses in
order to make extensive recommendations
for changes in the present curriculum. In
addition, a committee of ‘students to con-
stantly review the curriculum and make
recommendations to the FAS is being con-
sider'e’d.

In anticipation of this committee, some
changes are already being advocated. I,
myself, have submitted a recommendation,
in the form of a proposal, to reduce the
time/credit component now required of
students. That is, a student would not be
required to study 12 credits per term for
at least two terms, but would be allowed
any number of, credits per term provided
he completed 24 credits between Septem-
ber and September. However, this is still

in the realm of a proposal, nothing else. .

The Dean of the College, Dr. Schneewind,
has evinced a desire to institute an effec-
tive method for students to evaluate teach-
ers during the course of the term. This me-
chanism would," of course, provide the stu-
dent with anonymity, but would allow stu-
dents to convey their‘ grievances with
some tangible result in sight.

Student Affairs
Committee

The Student Affairs Committee of the
Faculty Senate and Student Government
are collaborating in theestablishment of
an informal channel of communication
within the University. At the suggestion of
Dr. John Townsend, we are reviving the
defunct Project THOUGHT, giving it some
direction and a little more planning. The
efficacy of such a program is, of course,
contingent upon student participation. If
this program is successful, it can become
a departure point for the initiation or sup-

~ port of particular programs.

Student Government

Whatever flaws or deficiencies are per-
ceived in Student Government as a govern-
ing body have been amply and pointedly
discussed. In response to this discontent,
we have embarked on the restructuring of
Student Government. The goal, as I see it,
is to open the structure of Student Govern-
ment to participation by any student who
cares to become involved in the action on
campus. This will require a new philoso-
phical. concept of Student Government
which will remove much of the bureau-
cracy which closes the system. It also re-
quires that Student Government divest it-
self of purely social functions like Home-
coming. etc., and devote itself to gover-
nance.

Concomitant with" this self-study of Stu-
dent Government, a committee is being
formed to study university governance.
Drawing on all four bodies of the universi-
ty-students, faculty, administrators‘ and
trustees—this committee will attempt to
study relevant areas in the University that
are in some way involved in governance,
and will culminate its activities, possibly,
by making recommendations for new or
modified structures of community gover-
nance. Clearly the present system of gov-
ernance thwarts student involvement in
the actual governance. The question, to my
mind, is not whether to increase. student
participation in community governance,
but how to do so. This, of course, presup-
poses student control over all areas which
solely affect them.

What I have tried to do here is to com-
bine a president’s report with a record of
the accomplishments of Student Govern-
ment in the past few months. Very little is
finitely accomplished, all the changes and
additions listed above are part of a process
and it is difficult to stop the process and
obtain a locus of points in areas where we
are presently engaged in change. As’ I
noted, the student outlook has changed, as
it has on most campuses in the country, and

students are beginning to take the right of

self-governance. Students still docilely ac-
cept externally imposed governance in
many areas where they should not. The pro-
cess of de-conditioning and re-‘educating is
tedious and should begin with incoming
freshman. There are contradictions of
power where students are alternately
granted and then deprived of decision-
making power which must be discontinued.
They can be, but it requires students to
show their desire for this power and their
willingness to accept the responsibility for
administering self-governance. Once that
is established, there is no reasonable ra-
tionale for not granting this power.

The tone of this report is an optimistic
one, as I meant it to be. -However, students
should not be misled; the changes listed
herein were forged by students and faculty
who are responsive to and unconcerned
with student desire to be fu1l—fledged mem-
bers of the University community. Some of
our accomplishments resulted from “coer-
cive” tactics; we can in the future evolve
mechanism to obviate tactics which bring
pressure to hear when there is no other
way, but we are a long way at present from
that point. It is a far-cry from approving a
judicial system in principle, to abolition of
grades or other changes which threaten
the collective egos and power of the faculty
or administration, as was demonstrated
at the FAS by-laws meeting.

Progress is made by moving. ahead and
moving ahead can never be harmful to this
institution. But moving ahead requires dis-
cussion, experimentation and mostly flexi-
bility. We, as students, must be highly
flexible if we expect the faculty to be flexi-
ble. At the same time, we must remain
strong in the conviction that we must move
ahead—someh_ow.

Thinclads Topple Owls

‘Cop Second Dual Meet;
IC4/1'3 In Two Weeks

by BOB LEDERMAN -
 Jim Banner’s trackmen seem to like going out in style. The
' thinclads captured first place in 13 of 16 events last Wednesday
as they went on to rout Temple, 104-41 in their last dual meet

meet of the season.

“All the boys ran good races,” remarked Banner. “Aiken did a
nice job in the half. Smitty did well, Garnett did well, Kouvolo had a
good throw . . . they all did a good job.” .

In the javelin competition, Dan
Kouvolo hurled‘ the thinclads to
their first win of the day with a
strong 226-9. While this mark
is nearly a foot under Dan’s own
best past effort, it missed the Sta-
dium record (which he holds) by
only 2-1.

_ Bryant Salter, apparently re-
' covered from an early season heel

A injury, took top spots in both the

high jump (6-2) and the triple
V jump (48-7). Salter will be one of
many of Banner’s trackmen who

I ' .will be competing in the IC4A’s

I later this month.

‘Dave Garnett, just off the injury
list, returned to form as he led the
way across the finish line in the
100-yard dash. Garnett had been
hampered by a thigh muscle he
pulled during the Big Four Meet.

_ Another bright spot on the after-
noon was provided by Smitty
Brown. Smitty‘ took a first in the
E440 dash (49-2) “as well as con-
tributing to the victories «in the

 .. 440 yard and mile relays.

Jumping in the Stadium for his
last time, senior John Gurson cap-

  tured first place in the long jump

competition. Gurson is another
‘reason for the 2-0 record the
trackmen attained in dual meets
this year.

I As usual Jerry Richey and Mark
Vornhagen provided a winning

1 ’ one-two punch in the mile and the

two-mile races, respectively. Jer-

 -r.y‘- captured the mile (4:15.6),
I . . beating out Temple’s Ed Schilling

and Vornhagen won the two-miler
(9:35), finishing ‘ahead of team-
mates Greg Rodgers and Mike
Nolan.

HS Thinclad

Recruited-
Javelin Star

‘Track coach Jim Banner
has announced that Ray Mush-

 inski of Ambridge High School,

one of the top javelin throwers in

I the country, has accepted a track
scholarship and will attend the
University next fall.

Mushinski -is the defending
PIAA state champion, and this
season his best throw was 239’
41/2”. That toss is believed to be
the longest in the country.

_“He (Mushinski) and Kouvolo

should give us an outstanding 1-2

punch,” said Banner.

Javelin tosser Dan Kouvolo,
who also hails from Ambridge
High School, holds the current
Pitt record of 236’11”. Kouvo-

lo, a sophomore, was the PIAA‘

champ just before Mushinski.

According to Banner, Mushin-
ski, a 6-0, 185-pounder, “has the

‘I I potential to be one of the finest

collegiate throwers in the coun-
try.”

 

 

With the regular season now be-
hind them, Banner and a number
of his boys are looking forward to
the IC4A’s, May 30 and 31. Fol-
lowing that meet, they will com-
pete in the NCAA in June. ’

TENNIS

The tennis team once again
finished on the bottom as they
dropped their eighth consecu-
tive match of ' the season to
Carnegie-Mellon University’s
classy netters, 9-0.

The win lifted Carnegie-'Mel-
lon’s record to'8-1, while the
hapless netters of coach Ben
Pope have yet to win.

Tomorrow, the tennis team
travels north to Grove City in
search of that initial victory,
The match will begin at 1:30
p.m.

After the Grove City contest,
the netters will have only three
other matches. They are slated
to host Allegheny on May 24,
visit Youngstown May 26,
and finish the season at home
the next afternoon against Hir-
am.

Home matches will be play-
ed on the new tennis courts be-
hind Trees Hall. The last four
matches are supposed to be
the easiest part of the sched-
ule this year, so the netters
will be out to break their long
losing streak.

Mitters Down Dukes! Eagles; . Q
Play Two Games At Penn St. 

by ED CONLEY

Baseball coach Bobby Lew-
is has had a better-than-aver-
age week, so far. His squad
hasn’t suffered a rain-out; the
team won two games on two suc-
cessive days; and Lewis hopeful-
ly, saw the last of Leech Farm
“home” field.

Lewis couldn’t do anything
about the weather or the site of
the game, but he was happy to see
those things turn out the way they
did. The victories, however, were
accepted with the afterthoughts
that follow any game.

Tuesday, the mitters trounced
the Duquesne . Dukes, 12-2-
for eight innings. Lewis gave
some of his regulars well-deserv-"
ed rests, and pulled Mike Niccols
out of the game in favor of reliev-
er Rich Orpneck in the ninth.

"Three outs and seven runs later,

the mitters escaped ‘with a 12-9
win.

“That’s what happens when you’
try to give everybody a chance to

play,” Lewis muttered. “I doit
all the time.”

Lewis couldn’t afford to try to
field “everybody” in the 6-2 de-
cision over Clarion State on Wed-
nesday. The Golden Eagles kept
the score a little too close for six
innings.

Two sacrifice flies gave the
mitters two runs in that span,
only enough to obtain a 2-2
tie. A couple of infield singles by
Tom Wulk and Al Petro in the
third, and a run-scoring double by
Woody Bressler in the sixth ac-
counted for the Eagles’ scoring. ,

GOLF .

The golf team finished fifth
among six teams competing in
the Indiana Invitational at In-
diana State Wednesday after-
noon, but that was better than
coach Rex Peery originally ex-
pected from his 2-6 squad.

“I owe the boys something,”
said Peery. “,1 said inthe pa-

ably finish last and we didn’t. ”

But perhaps the most pleas-
ant surprise of the afternoon
was the performance of num-
ber three man Mike McGuire.
McGuire finished in a dead-
lock» with Bucknell’s Ken Solar.
However, in the play-off for
the tournament medalist, Mc-
Guire bogied and settled for a
loss as Solar birdied the hole.

This afternoon at 1:30 p.m.,
the golfers will be looking for
their third victory against Du-
quesne, on their home course,
Shannopin Country Club.

 

CENTERFIELDER JOE McCA|N takes a generous lead off first base against

Duquesne Tuesday afternoon. The.s|ugging outfielder led the I2-run at-

’ tack with three. hits, including a long triple to left-centerfield. The next
day, against Clarion, McCain banged out the mitters’ first home run..

The mitters finally broke away
with a pair of runs in both the sev-
enth and eighth frames. John
Fred_land’s infield single, a hit
batsmen, and an error loaded the
bases for the mitters in the sev-
enth.

Sammy Glass then banged the
two winning tallies - across the
plate with a sharp smash over sec-
ond base.

“The better the pitcher, the bet-
ter Sammy hits,” Lewis said, not-
ing that Joe Filipowski, Clarion’s
best, was pitching when the re-
ceiver connected. '

Glass also rammed a double
down the left field line in the
eighth to drive in the final run.

That hit came four batters after
Joe McCain smashed the first
home run of the spring for the mit-
ters. The inside-the-park clout
was just out of the reach of a div-
ing George Vishnich, Eagle right-
fielder. _

“It was a well hit ball,” Lewis
said. “There was nothing to be
ashamed about on that one. It had
to have gone at least 400 feet.”

Solonickne had little trouble re-
tiring Clarion in the ninth, gaining
his second win in three starts.
The Eagles didn’t hit too many
solid shots off the part-time.pitch-

€I‘.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

MIKE NICCOLS
Unscored Upon

“His ball wasn’t moving as well
in the eighth as it had been,
though,” Lewis said. “So, I got
Niccols ready. But we didn’t need
him.”

“Solonicke, pitched a g o o d
game,” Lewis continued. “It was
the kind of game that I like — nice

 

pitching and good fielding. It was I

just a beautiful game. It was a
baseball game.”

“Yes, I was more pleased with *

this game (Wednesday’s). I’ll
take the other win, but I wasn’t
thrilled,” he added. “Not when
you give up seven runs in one inn-
ing. Nobody should give up .sev-
en in one inning.”

Lewis will have the opportun-
ity to “accept” four more wins
this season if his team can come
through for him. Two of those re-
maining games will be played at
Penn State tomorrow afternoon.

WHO CARES ABOUT STUDENT OPINION?

BUSINESSMEN DO. 

_ Three chief executive officers— The ‘Goodyear

Tire & Rubber Company's Chairman, Russell
DeYoung, The Dow Chemical C ompany’s
President, H. D. Doan, and Motorola ’s
Chairman, Robert W. Galv/'n——are responding
to serious questions and viewpoints posedby
leading student spokesmen about business
and its role in our changing society through

means of a campus / corporate Dialogue
Program.

Here, Arthur M. Klebanoff, a senior at Yale,
who plans graduate studies and a career in
government, is exchanging views with

Mr. Galvin.

In the course of the Dialogue Program, Arnold
She/by, a Latin American Studies major at
Tulane, also will explore issues with Mr.
Galvin; as will David M. Butler, Electrical
Engineering, Michigan State, and Stan Chess,

Journalism, Cornell, with Mr. Doan,‘ similarly,
Mark Bookspan, Pre-Med, Ohio State, and
David G. Clark, Political Science MA
candidate at Stanford, with Mr. DeYoung.

Dear Mr. Galvin:

Student reaction to business is conditioned
by what appears in newspapers and
magazines. Andwhat appears concerns
investigations more frequently

than innovations.

We read of industries with
across-the-board product unreliability,
and watch the nation's largest corporations
attack Ralph Nader for defending the
public against such frauds. Many of us
have had our own bad experiences with
mis-filled orders or short-lived products
more expensive to repair than to replace.

We read of industries raping the
countryside in the Redwood forests of
California, the strip mines of Kentucky,
and the oil fields of Oklahoma while
preserving their malicious advantage with
a peculiar and depressingly traditional
brand of legislative log-rolling. We see the
regulators co-opted by the regulated, and
the future of an industry sacrificed to the
short-run advantage of a single firm.

And we read of concerts of industries
defining their own public interest, and
calling it progress. Some of us have
trouble seeing progress in hundred foot ’
long trailer trucks, brand-name drugs,
and supersonic airplanes and the
congested airports from which they

are meant to fly.

This is a college generation deeply
concerned with personal honesty. To
many college students business appears
unreliable and destructively self-
interested. Only the most positive actions
by the business community can change
this reaction, and create any significant
degree of interest on the campus.

My question Mr. Galvin is what will
business do to police itself?

Dear Mr. Klebanoff:

A newspaper that ran stories such as

"120 Million People Committed No
Murders Yesterday” . . . ”Thousands of
Officials Found Corruption-Free” . . .
"Very Few Students Are Sex-Crazed

Dope Addicts." would lose readership.
Newspapers must, by definition, report
the ”news”—including factual occurrences.
but putting emphasis.on extraordinary
events. Crimes, wars, and corruption, are

unusual happenings, and are.thus reported -

in our news media. ' '

A report that a "New Drivemobile Sedan
is Found Unsafe" is of greater importance
to the motoring public than, say,

"Fifty Makes of Autos Pass Safety Tests."

-Most newspaper reports of fraudulent

practices by business firms are accurate.
However, newspapers are sometimes
guilty of subjective interpreting and
reports of entire industries with ”across-
the-board product unreliability” can only
be described in those terms.

A single corporation (much less an" entire
industry) would not survive long by
producing inferior goods. Competition is
self-regulating for one thing. and most ‘
corporations are bound. to meet certain
standards specified by various trade
associations and institutes. Government
regulations, too. must be met, and.

finally, the buying public has the last word. ._

Business is policing itself. Mr. Klebanoff.
Consider some of the positive aspects of
modern, responsible corporations while
you weigh the shortcomings and
malpractices. You have read of industries
"raping the countryside," but apparently
you haven't read reports of businesses
and industries involved in conservation—
an involvement in which billions of dollars
are being expended, and will continue to
cost many billions more.

An important conservation activity by
industry is the building of huge lakes by
the nation's investor-owned electric power
companies. Although ‘these water masses
are essential to the companies’ operations.
they create valuable and much-needed
reservoirs of fresh water. Power
companies usually open these lakes to the
public for recreational purposes. An
example of this is Commonwealth Edison's
latest watershed which provides the

public with over 100-miles of newly '
reclaimed shoreline.

Lumber companies, far from ”raping”
our forestlands. are in fact responsible for
their growth. A lumber company would

    

Arthur M. Klebanoff, Yale

not stay in business if it did not operate
on the principle of ”sustained yield”—
growing at least as many trees as it harvests.

Boise-Cascade Lumber Company is one

of many that conducts multi-use

forestry programs—the compa.ny's timber .
lands are open to the public for
recreational purposessuch as camping,

-fishing, hunting, hiking. Logging roads

allow public access into these areas and
are also invaluable in forest fire control.
It is a fact that game increases in well-
managed forests . . . this again is a
contribution to conservation.

The National Association of Manufacturers
estimates that American corporations are
currently spending in excess of $500
million annually on air pollution control
research and methods. Many millions more
are being poured into water pollution
control by business.

Slum clearance and renovation currently
claim the energies and financial resources
of airnumber of corporations; others

are working on improved sewage and
garbage disposal systems.

Yes, there is some legislative "log-
rolling”, lobbying, and other questionable
practices. just as there are some
unscrupulous doctors, students who cheat,
corrupt people in government, criminals
roaming our streets, traitors and

deserters in the Armed Forces. Like you,

I believe that unethical practices in ..
business—as well as in other fields-—are
intolerable.

Efforts by business to "clean house" are
increasing, just as business’ involvement
in society's problems is more evident.
Hopefully, students will be more willing
in the future to examine both sides of the
ledger before passing final judgments. If
more of the brighter, talented students,
with the high ideals and personal
integrity that you mentioned would join
business. the self-policing process that
you and almost all business leaders seek,
would advance more rapidly.

Sincerely, E
Robert W. Galvin
Chairman, Motorola Inc.
