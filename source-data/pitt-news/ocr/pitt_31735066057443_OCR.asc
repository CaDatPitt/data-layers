New Towers food court to open within weeks

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

In response to the overflowing lines
in the Schenley Food Court and stu-
dents’ concerns about the safety of car-
rying cash in Oakland, Marriott Corp.
and Pitt Food Services took massive
strides this summer to assure students
more options and greater flexibility
when purchasing meals through the
university.

The centerpiece of the overhaul

will be the Sept. 15 opening of the new
food court, Eddie’s, replacing the
Tower A cafeteria. In addition. gone
is the “meals per week” meal plan
in favor of the new BLOCK meal plan
and an expanded choice dollars system.

“We have been working to develop a
very broad plan to give students the
flexibility they want,” Associate Vice
Chancellor for Business and Finance
John DeVitto said in a June interview.
“We figured it made sense to renovate
in a way which students are asking

for.”

Burger King. Baskin Robbins and
Dunkin Donuts are a few of the restau-
rants which will have serving stations
in the new food court along with
pizza, delicatessen,‘ bagel and salad sta-
tions.

According to Director of Food
Services Betsy Sallade—Farina, the food
court will also feature an area where-
students can buy in bulk on their meal
plan.

“CIS has traditionally done
major upgrades during the

The Forbes Quad and

FOCUS program aims to ease transition
and provide academic and social support

By Melanie A; Stawicki
For The Pitt News

Pitt sophomore Janera Solomon remembers
feeling a little anxious beginning her fresh-
man year.

Between adjusting to college academics
and making friends, incoming students can
feel a little lost and apprehensive. '

The FOCUS program, in its’ second year,
was created to “provide continuing social and
academic support for African-American and
Hispanic students during their passage from
high school to college,” according to the
Office of New Student Programs.

There are no grade requirements for the
program, so even at-risk students can partici-
pate, said Donna Walker, of the Office of
New Student Programs.

Solomon and 258 other freshmen made up
the first FOCUS group last year, and 300 new
students are expected to participate in the
program this fall.

Walker said students were divided into
FOCUS groups of 10-13 people and headed
by one or two trained group leaders. Groups
met monthly to discuss topics ranging from
study skills to recreation in Pittsburgh. _

Outings were also scheduled for students to

9 socialize together.

“There was a luncheon, a Pirate game, a
bowling social with [Black Action Society]
and a social gathering with the black Greek
system,” Walker said.

The program is also “a retention program
aimed at African-American and Hispanic stu-
dents to provide them with the social and
educational atmosphere needed for gradua-
tion,” Walker said.

Students are tracked to ensure that at-risk
students get necessary scholastic aid like
“study skills and academic intervention,”
according to Walker.

leader last year, described the FOCUS pro-

“Students will be able to
come in and buy a ham
sandwich or a pound of ham
to take-out by using this
meal plan,” Sallade—Farina
said. “Items like fresh fruit
and milk will also be avail-
able.”

DeVitto said students will
not have to pay inflated
prices for this convenience.
“Prices will be very reason-
able, just as they are in
Schenley Food Court.”

According to Food
Services, Eddie’s will be
open from 7:30 a.m. to 11
p.m. weekdays except
Friday when it will close at
8 p.m.

Students not living in the
Towers will have direct
access to the food court
from from the outside,
thanks to an entrance built
on the Forbes Avenue steps.

Sallade—Farina said food
in bulk will also be avail-
able in Lothrop Hall when
Food Services opens a con-
venience store there Oct. 1.

Students will be able to
purchase food all over
Oakland with a swipe of
their identification cards,

according to Sallade—Farina,
who said the benefit of hav-
ing a meal plan or choice
dollars isn’t just in the
money you have, but also
the safety.

“It gives [students] an
opportunity of not having to
carry cash around campus
and I think that is essential,”

“The BLOCK meal plan is

The plan, available to stu-

allows the holder to use
blocks for cafeteria meals or
as cash equivalency.

“The plan is so good
because of its flexibility,”
Sallade—Farina said. “A stu-
dent can eat all breakfasts if
he/she wants or can use
their block to pay for other
people.”

Another advance which

Labs

°From page 1

Another improvement stu-
dents might notice is tnc memo-
ry upgrades being installed on
all DEC 325 and DEC 486
machines.

According to Schatz, the
upgrade “should significantly
reducethe time required for an
application to come up.”
Memory upgrades _are already
installed in the Forbes Quad and
Sutherland Hall labs and will
soon be installed in the remain-
ing labs.

Faster and better service in the
labs is now available due to‘ the
addition of two new DOS
servers and one , new
DECStation 5000 for Macintosh
serving, according to Schatz.

“The user will see the differ-
ence when the [computer]
boots,” said Schatz.

CIS has also installed new
projection panels in all of its
classroom labs. The new equip-
ment is l6 million color and full
motion video capable and when
the new projectors are installed
they will project an image 40
percent larger than previously,
“so the class will be better able
to see.” said Schatz.

All of the IBM PS2 computers
ingHillman Library and David
Lawrence Hall labs have been
replaced with “higher end”

DOS486 machines, according "to

Schatz. “The PS2s couldn’t sup-
port some software. The 486s
will support everything.”

Eight MAC Power PC’s are
on campus and will replace
eight MAC Plus computers
within a week. Schatz said only
eight MAC Pluses will be
replaced so that “they can be
integrated into the environment
before purchasing and replacing
the remaining 69 MAC Pluses.”
Schatz said he expects to replace
the remaining MAC’s duringthe
fall term.

CIS has also reconfigured
DOS machines to improve the
performance of Windows.
According to Schatz, “Windows
used to run slow. The new con-
ﬁguration will make it run bet-
ter.”

Schatz hopes students will
notice increased consulting lev-
els and lab hours. According to
Schatz, this was made possible
by acquiring software packages
that make reconﬁguration easier,
and cut the cost of lab adminis-
tration.

The Forbes Quad lab now has
increased weekend hours and
the Benedum Hall lab is a 24-
hour lab, according to Schatz.

According to Schatz, CIS has
also installed upgrades to sever-
al popular DOS software pack-
ages, including Excel, Lotus 123
and Stata. Schatz expects an
upgrade for the word processing
program Microsoft Word to be
installed within a week. An
upgrade has also been installed
for the MAC version of
Mathematica.

gram as “a voice for the freshman students”
in the program.

Citing the frustrations incoming students
encounter with advisors, scheduling and
learning about the campus, ‘Brown-Young, a
senior nursing major, said she knows several
of her older peers who would have liked to
have had the FOCUS program when they
were starting at Pitt.

Brown-Young, a Resident Assistant in
Towers last year, decided to establish a
program for FOCUS students to meet the
black Greek fraternities and sororities last
year. ' ..

Brown-Young responded to the widespread
interest of her FOCUS students towards the
black Greeks and she said she hoped the
G.P.A. requirements of the black Greeks
would be an incentive to students to keep up
their grades. An open forum was held with
the black Greek leaders and FOCUS stu-

dents.

Brown-Young won an award as
Outstanding FOCUS leader last year and still
tries to keep in touch with her group of now-
sophomores.

Solomon said she plans to serve as a group
leader this year to help freshmen like herself
last year.

Although the program was helpful for “get-
ting to know other students and getting infor-
mation of tutoring and advising," there are a
couple of things that she would change,
Solomon said.

Solomon said she feels that sometimes the
groups could have been coordinated better
and students could have been contacted more
often by group leaders.

However, she admits many mix-ups could
have resulted from the fact that it was a first
year program. ’

“I think it’s a good program. I think it has
a lot of potential,” Solomon said.

dors such as Domino’s, Food Services has
added Papa John’s Pizza, Miami Subs,
Ritter’s Diner and Ruggieri’s Grocery Store
to the list of places accepting choice dollar

“This is something I thought was impor-
tant to students because many people are
using choice dollars,” Sallade-Farina said.
Although she said many pizza places were
interested in joining choice dollars, the
expansion means on-campus students can

She said even though a meal plan is

Food Services is already seeing a significant
increase in voluntary participation in the

“We’re seeing more commuters take
advantage of the services” Sallade-Farina

are less constraints on where and when stu-
dents can eat.

Natural Born Killers

Directed by Oliver Stone

Written by Oliver Stone, David Veioz and
Richard Rutowski

Starring Juliette Lewis, Woody Harrelson and
Robert Downey, Jr.

Had Oliver Stone meant for Natural Born
Killers to be nothing more than a macabre
Bonnie and Clyde, he would have slammed

home a powerfully visceral murder—spree which *

may have shaken audiences right out. of this
summer’s brain—dead Gumpy sleep. But while
K///ers succeeds as a rapid-fire visual blitzkrieg,
Stone and company seem to have looked no fur-
ther than TV Guide for this script, based on a
Quentin Tarantino story, which pits two darling
serial killers Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and
Mallory (Juliette Lewis) against America’s giant
McMedia, sitcom-soaked culture. it’s a glitterfest
featuring a ceaseless barrage of visual styles -—
Beta video, Super-8, grainy B&W documentary,
MTVesque colorsplash, rear projection images
and bang, bang, bang animation —— but unfortu-
nately, it’s all foo|’s gold. Stone approached
K///ers wielding satire, but succumbed to
preaching and self—righteousness which detract
from the movie’s lustful, On the Fioad—with—a—
vengeance appeal. Call it the big snooze button
for the fall.

After ingesting large quantities of recent
tabloid sensations — O.J., Buttafuoco, Bobbitt,
Harding and blah, blah and blah — Stone
dropped this surreal slice of TV on us, which
would have been OK had he not forgotten to add
a little bit of wit. In one peyote—drenched scene,
Stone literally prints the movie’s simple message
across Mickey and Mallory’s chests: too much

by ion Imyes I  

 

America’s Most Wanted (redubbed American
Maniacs) and even momentarily stoops to the
depths of WWF wrestling.

Stone wanted to deliver a shocking Swiftian
proposal: if ya can’t beat the media into respon-
sible reporting or the masses into turning off
their televisions, kill ‘em. But there’s nothing
shocking about this movie, it is much more a dis-
tant piece of science fiction than a coherent
satire of contemporary culture. In essence, there
is never any real emotion or engaging tension:
the fast cuts and frantic pace prohibit any
absorption of the material, the setting is far too
surreal to make us care about the victims and
heroes Mickey and Mallory are so much like
invoice video game characters that there’s no
reason to care about their getaways, Clockwork
Orange antics or even their love. Amer/can
Maniacs host Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.)
isn’t much more than an over-the—top silly carica-
ture of media sleaze more concerned with rat-
ings than insightful investigation. Stone nails his
adolescent sermon down when he explores the
camera as a dangerous gun metaphor. In his
avaricious lust for ratings, Gale inevitably aban-
dons the camera and becomes the gun wielding
monster he, being the media, has always been.

I Yet in spite of K///ers’ obvious problems, the

3

The stream-of-consciousness visual barrage is,
yes, disturbing but also demonstrative of Stone’s
virtuoso camera technique. The movie is
intensely layered; sometimes hallucinatory a la
The Doors, other times delivering a gut-wrench-
ing black and white crime story, occasionally
delving into a neon green dreamy haze, all
smashed together in a bizarre web resembling a
David Lynch endeavor. Harreison and Lewis
play their dysfunctional roles to full tilt, finding a
perfect home within Stone’s idiotic sitcom splat-
terscape.

indeed, Stone blurs the lines between reality
and TV reality resulting in one of the movie’s
most clever scenes. Mallory’s “real” home life is
full of machismo laden punchlines, blatantly sex-
ist humor complete with an incessent, moronic
laughtrack. Rodney Dangerfield plays Mallory’s
raunchy, incestuous father and the humor lies in
that its a parody of the widely popular “Married
with Children” —— the scene is simply a brilliant
attack on an evergrowing sitcom culture.

Also, keep an ear open for a furious sound-
track composed by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent
Reznor, which features a few of his own haunt-
ing, painful tracks along with Rage Against the
Machine, Dr. Dre, Leonard Cohen, Peter Gabriel
and the Cowboy Junkies’ delicate version of
“Sweet Jane,” among many others. And Jane‘s
Addiction’s “Ted Just Admit it” is a most cleverly
placed song. While Mallory blows away a gas
station attendant for ejaculating too soon, Perry
Ferrell delivers the lines, “Camera got them
images/ the camera got them all/ nothing’s
shocking” and then he repeatedly shouts, (these
lines were left out of the film) “sex is violent, sex
is violent/ sex is violent!” Keeping this small
soundbyte out of Killers would’ve been an aes-

movie can be a highly watchable experience. '7 ""1 P3995 A

Once upon a time, 7”
jazz records were all Over
the place. That recording
format introduced most
people to the first Gerry
Mulligan Quartet in the ‘50s.
A lot of record labels put out
box sets, with eight tunes
on four 45s.

Singles provided the per-
fect taste of jazz for the lis-
tener who didn’t have the
attention span for the
stretched out solos heard in
clubs at the time. These
albums also held more
music than the Original vinyl
format, 78s.

in the ‘60s when hard bop
tunes became jukebox

favorites in chili houses,
labels like Blue Note had a
field day releasing 45s of
funky tunes by Ike Quebec,
Jimmy Smith and Lee
Morgan.

But as the ‘70s came in,
the popularity of jazz 45s
fell by the wayside. And of
course we all know what
happened to jazz vinyl.

Well, The Flying
Luttenbachers turned the
tide with their first two
record releases. 546
Seconds of Noise and its
follow—up 1389 Seconds of
Noise, introduced the
band’s explosive free jazz
to a format where the fren-

zied music has never visit-
ed before —— the little record
with the big hole. And noth-
ing will ever be the same.
The Flying Luttenbachers
hail from Chicago, a city
rich in its jazz tradition,
whether you're talking
swing or avant garde.
Drummer Weasel Walter
teamed up with tenor saxo-
phonists Chad Organ and
Hal Russell in December of
1991 to form the band. Two
months later, the trio per-
formed live on radio station
WNUR, making what would
become their cassette-only
debut ‘
At the time, Russell's

name was already synony-
mous with virtually every
jazz movement in the city.
He played with swing and
be—bop groups, and was a
catalyst in the area’s free
jazz movement in the ‘60s.
Not long after recording
with Walter and Organ,
Russell left the group to
build up his legendary NRG
Ensemble.

Ken Vandermark joined
the Luttenbachers just in
time to record the 546 sin-
g|e..-Despite the title, the
Only noisy factor Of the
record stems from its raw
recording quality. There is
more to it than just squonk-
ing horns and spastic drum-
ming flying out Of the
grooves. Organ and
Vandermark build their
solos On fast melody line,
as Opposed to heavy tones
than ignite into squeals and
walls. Walter’s drumming
sounds like an exploding

with the drums answering
the two saxes. Elsewhere,
one of the horn players
does a good Dewey
Redman imitation, growling
through his horn as he
blows.

Last year, the
Luttenbachers released
the 1389 7”, which upped
the ante in terms of perfor-
mance and sound quality.
“Attack Sequence (93B)”
sports a thrashy theme
before it shifts into the
solos. The melody of
“Clammer + Sprint” blows

The song could have been
penned in the 1950’s. It has
the charm and beauty of the
Everly Brothers mixed with
a little Buddy Holly flair. I
don’t know why more bands

this any more. Skeptics
claim that Guided by Voices

are wrong on this account.
The crooning of Robert

The flipside to the record
leaves me disappointed, but
it still couldn’t persuade me
to dislike the single as a
whole. “Red Chair” is con-
tributed by Jenny Mae
Leffel from the band Vibra
Lux. The Song is a delicate,
piano-based ballad that is
sure to dredge up compar-
isons to Kate Bush. Maybe
it’s the vocals. Jenny Mae’s
voice is either enjoyable or
darn right annoying
depending on your taste in
music. The song is very
pretty but is hard to listen

 

to. The keyboards create an
environmentfor the melody
to become sterile and bor-
ing. This song could appeal
to some, perhaps if it wasn’t
overshadowed by the A-
side. The bottom line is that
this is a real GBV split 7”,
not some clever spoof. ‘‘If
We Wait” is a gem, and for
people tired of black vinyl,
it’s printed on grey/bubble
gum swirl vinyl.

Horses blw Stable Will
Palace Songs
Drag City

They can change their
name and their lineup, but
the sounds of Will Oldham
and his crew never
change. 0 The versatile
actor/singer/songwriter sur-
passed any expectations of
country brilliance with this
record. Looking at and lis-
tening to the past, the
Palace Brothers (or Palace

. chorus

Songs as they are known
now) capture the spirit of
Hank Williams and offer it to
the world. Their rendition is
warbly and subtle, but
equally dynamic and
secure. “Horses” is just
plain spooky. The tune was
written by the Mekons and
fits Oldham like a pair of
worn Wrangler jeans —
right on. “l’d ride wild hors-
es if they’d let me,” starts a
heart-felt confession of
drunken wisdom that the
epitomizes:
“Everybody needs an
Angel.” With this sentiment
the song swells with a pas-
sion that could not be
rivaled neither by the new
Nashville sound nor by a
lousy Eagles reunion tour.
The backing musicians, The
Pale Horse Riders, are the
same players on the first
Palace Bros. album.
Containing some members
of the seminal Slint, the

KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

music their permanent gig.

A Palace original, “Stable
Will,” is the perfect song to
back up “Horses.” Although
the musicians are not the
same, it is as brooding as
the A-side. Offering dusty
imagery of stables and an
invitation to the soul of the
cowboy, “Stable Will” reads
like a fractured John
Steinback novel. The lyrics
are very well crafted and
are subsequently printed on
a supplement for all to read.
The song builds into a fren-
zied crescendo that drops
listeners back down on their
feet amazed. This song was
the highlight of their perfor-
mance at Lollapalooza’s
second stage. It tops off a
phenomenal single that
clearly displays the talent of
this Louisville band.

thetic crime,

What may be most dis-
turbing about Natural Borr
Killers is not the glossy
drunken violence, whicl“
admittedly has its owr
sadistic appeal, but rather
Stone’s arrogant use of it.
The film basically divides
the world into two equally
repulsive camps will‘
unslaked thirsts for vio-
lence: the couch potatc
masses and the capitalist
entertainment biz
(Hollywood included). The
movie’s long-winded tirade
can best be summed up by
Stone’s statement: “Our
society is bloated, not just
with crime, but with the
media coverage of it.” It’s
obvious that Stone is using
excessive violence to illus-
trate societal problems, but
in doing so he patronizes
his audience into a neurotic
conglomerate and elevates
himself onto the psychiatric
pedestal. We’re all sick, anc
Stone’s got the medicine.
Running in the same vein
as A Clockwork Orange, in
which repeated exposure tc
violent imageswas used tc

cure a dangerous man,»
Stone administers a heavy.
dose, overpowering viewers '
in an attempt to make peo-'"

ple say, “Hey, our society is
bloated with violence.”
Well, no shit! You would
expect more from a film-
maker whose proven ability
resides in tackling complex,
thought-provoking issues
(as found in JFK, Born or
the Fourth of July and

, Platoon). Such frustratingly

simple observations are not
the stuff to make an entire
movie out of. Stone has hid-

, den a dull argument behind

dazzling special effects and
computer enhancec
images, mesmerizing view-

‘ ers in the same way tabloid

TV holds people in rapture.
Like American Maniacs
host Wayne Gale, this
Natural Born Killers hosl
became the self-absorbed
monster from which he was
trying to distance himself.

When the Flying
Luttenbachers hit the
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern
stage on Saturday, they will
be a quartet because Ken
Vandermark has once again
taken a spot once occupied
by Hal Russell. The late
genius left an open seat in
the NRG Ensemble when
he’ passed away in 1992.

After Vandermark left the
Luttenbachers last summer,
the Ensemble ‘scooped him
up. Those of you who
attended the Ensemble’s
BBT gig last Friday got to
see Vandermark in action.
Of course that isn’t to say
that the Luttenbachers’
show will be a disappoint-

Opinions
Invade Haiti

On Tuesday, United Nations Secretary—General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali announced that he was abandoning efforts to per-
suade Haiti’s military leaders to step down peacefully. This, The
New York Times reports, leaves the Clinton administration with
only two options: to wait and hope that the now near-total block-
ade of Haiti convinces its military leaders to step down or to
order a U.S.-led invasion, already authorized by the UN Security
Council. _ . _ - -

It is time for Bill Clinton to show some backbone on foreign
policy and order an invasion of Haiti. Four Caribbean nations
announced yesterday that they would provide token forces in
order to make an invasion multinational. And years of economic
sanctions have not accomplished much more than a further
impoverishment of the many poor and destitute citizens of Haiti.

Furthermore, even if the sanctions were miraculously to work
in the next couple of months, a swift and relatively painless
invasion (Haiti has very little which could slow down the U.S.
military) would allow much— needed international aid to reach
Haiti. Jean-Bertrand Aristide could then rebuild his country
under the watchful eye of UN peacekeepers, and we could final-
ly send back the thousands of Haitian refugees currently in
limbo at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Clearly the simplest solution to the Haitian problem is to
invade and get it over with.

Reopen the Playhouse

The city of Pittsburgh has lost a landmark cultural asset. The
Pittsburgh Playhouse Film Repertory showed its final film last
night. Point Park College, which runs the Playhouse, suddenly
decided to ax the program a few weeks ago, ending the
Playhouse’s 26 years of showing classic, foreign and indepen-
dent movies.

This is a great loss to the entire city and especially Pitt stu-
dents. The Playhouse was next to Magee Women’s Hospital

«only a coupleof blocks from campus. That leaves the Beehive

as the only movie theater within close walking distance of Pitt.

The Beehive and a couple of other area theaters have
announced plans to show more foreign and independent movies
in the wake of the Playhouse’s closing. However it is likely that
with the closing of the Playhouse Pittsburgh has seen the demise
of classic movies on the big screen.

The reasons for the closing of the Playhouse are basically eco-
nomical. Point Park College said that the program incurred a
$107,000 loss in 1993; however Richard Rauh, the director of
the film program, claims he made a $30,000 profit according to
In Pittsburgh.

Hope does remain though. A local woman has started a Save
the Playhouse Hotline. Any disgrunteld Pitt patrons of the
Playhouse should call 734-8405 or 734-8406 and leave their
names, phone numbers and ideas on tape. With luck, someday
the Playhouse will once again reopen its doors for business.

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 1, 1994 A

”Tex” prepared for season with

By Brett Fondrk
Staﬁ" Writer

A high ball was ﬂoated up for
grabs in the comer of the end
zone. Senior wide receiver Billy
Davis leaped high above two
defenders to pull down the ball
amidst the cheers of jubilant Pitt
players and coaches at Mansion
Park Stadium in Altoona.

This play has typiﬁed Davis’s
camp. The words “spectacular”
and “great” are two adjectives
that have been used when people
have been asked to describe his
performance in the preseason.

Davis, who has been consid-
ered a solid receiver since his
freshman year at Pitt, appears to
be on the verge of having a big
senior year.

He will be the starter at split
end when the Panthers open the
1994 season against Texas. But
heading into fall camp, he was
projected as a back—up behind
sophomore Curtis Anderson.

Davis’s stock had apparently
fallen, and he was left as the odd
man out.

“I thought it was a misprint,”
he said. “I couldn’t believe it.”

Ironically, Davis was known at

..Irvin High School in Texas more
for his throwing skills than his

receiving.

His senior year he accumulat-
ed All-City, All-District, and All-
Region quarterback honors as he
threw for 1,200 yards. The year
before he had been an All-

Region free safety. Davis also
holds the current Texas state
record for the longest high
school punt.

“Our backs were against the
wall,” he said. “We were playing
against the fourth-ranked team in
Texas and our regular punter was
hurt so I gave it a shot.”

He boomed the punt 91 yards
and estimates that it traveled
over 75 yards in the air.

“I was the regular punter from
that point on,” he said.

Davis was recruited by
UCLA, Oklahoma, Houston,
Texas A&M and Pitt among oth-
ers.

“I chose Pitt because I wanted
to get something beyond foot-
ball,” he said. “I wanted a school
with a good academic reputa-
tion.”

Upon coming to Pitt, the
coaches looked at his 4.5 speed
and immediately converted him
to wide receiver.

He appeared in all 11 games,
catching 11 passes and playing
on every special teams unit.

His play improved dramatical-
ly his sophomore season as he
hauled in 34 passes and scored
three touchdowns.

Last season he started nine
games, but his production
dropped slightly as he caught 24
passes with only one touchdown.

“Last season, I expected too
much without enough condition-
ing,” he said. “I had a poor work
ethic. and it showed on the

“People had always told me I
had the talent, it’s just what I
wanted to do with it.”

What he decided on was a rig-

new aﬂitude

Davis spent the summer; with
intentions of trying to improve
every aspect of his game.

He ran. lifted weights, sharp-
ened his roﬁte running and spent
a lot of time practicing with the
quarterbacks.

The results have been increas-
es in his speed, endurance and
most importantly, a starting posi-
tion. _

“I realized for myself and for
the program that nothing is free.
nothing is gonna be handed to
you.” ‘he said. “You’re gonna
have to work for what you want
and earn it.”

Davis has in fact changed his
entire attitude. .

“Before I was outspoken, I did
a lot of talking and didn’t back it
up,” he said. "This season, l’l1 do
my talking on the ﬁeld.”

His new attitude has not gone
unnoticed by teammates.

“The work he did in the off-
season has really made a differ-
ence in his game.” fullback Chad
Dukes said. "

“He’s really stepped up from
last year, senior center Lawson
Mollica said. “His blocking has
improved, he catches balls
across the middle with no fear
and he has become more of a
leader.”

With a number of young wide-
outs on the team, someone must
step forward‘ and assume the role
of a leader.

“I’m a leader by example,” he

Panthers‘ defense is key against Texas
Tom Tumulty and co. hope to stop high octane offense

 

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

Last year Pitt opened the foot-
ball season with a stunning 14-
10 Victory

0 v e r

Southern

Mississippi.

The key to

the victory

was the play

of the

defense, which was led by line-
backer Tom Tumulty’s l7 tack-
les, two interceptions and a sack.
Pitt will need this kind of perfor-
mance from Tumultyhand the
rest of the defense as the

Panthers prepare to face Texas 1

Saturday in the season opener.

“The first game last year was
very emotional,” Tumulty said.
“We had a new coach, and
nobody really knew what to
expect.”

“This year we’re more confi-
dent,” he said. “I look around
myself and everyone is back. I
think that the confidence is col-
lective with the whole team.”

The defense, which is essen-
tially the same unit as, last sea-
son, appears to be primed to
take advantage of a Texas squad
that has been decimated by
injuries. As recently as last
week, the Longhorns had 21
players sit out of a scrimmage.

“We’ve suffered critical
injuries,” head coach John
Mackovic said. “We had count-
ed on a number of players who
won’t be with us.”

The area hardest hit has been

 

wideout. Starters Mike Adams
and Lovell Pinkney will miss
the game because of a violation
of an NCAA amateurism rule.
Texas will also be without the
service of backups Justin
McLemore and Wane McGarity,
both of whom are down with
knee injuries.

Despite the numerous injuries,
Tumulty said Pitt’s defense is
taking nothing for granted.

“We’re gonna try not to think
about who’s injured,” he said.
“I’m sure they have capable
backups. We will just try to exe-
cute what the coaches have
planned and we’ll be OK.”

The Texas offense will be led
by sophomore quarterback Shea
Morenz. Over the last eight
games last season he threw 12
TD passes. His strong play car-
ried over into the preseason as
he completed 31 of 42 passes for
465 yards, seven touchdowns
and no interceptions. Many
think that he could make a run at
All—American honors.

“I’ve seen him [Morenz] take
some licks on ﬁlm that surprised
me that he even got up,”
Tumulty said. “He’s not afraid to
run or take a hit. _He’s a great
leader.”

“The most important thing is
that we have a good attitude,” he
said. “I think we can win it, and
so does the rest of the team.”

While Texas has been rocked
by injuries, the Panthers have
been relatively healthy. The only
significant injury that Pitt had to
report was on offense. Curtis
Anderson is out with a knee

start at ﬂanker, will be replaced
by Dietrich Jells.

In fact, the healthy Panthers
are already receiving respect

often heard last season.

Head coach John Majors named

week. This will be Fitzgerald.-’s
first Division I college start.
“Right now I’m relaxed,” he
said. “I’m sure I’ll have some
butterﬂies Thursday and Friday.

but after the first couple of snaps I

I should be OK.”

The offense will be looking to
improve on the 15.3 points a
game that it averaged last sea-
son.

“We’ve got to play smart,"
Fitzgerald said. “We’ll compete
with everybody and definitely
get more wins than last season.”

Pitt has won their last seven
season openers. They will be
looking to make it eight against
the 18th-ranked Longhorns.

“We don’t know a lot about
Texas,” head coach John Majors
said. “They have an excellent
quarterback. and their running
backs are solid.”

Majors is pleased with his
team’s preseason performance
and is cautiously optimistic
about the coming game.

“We have made progress and
are better the whole way
around,” he said, “But I don’t
look for us to have an easy
time.”

Longhorns‘ lackluster defense

looks to improve

P-5

Alter tumultuous '93 season, Brackens, Carter head D‘

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

When the 18th-ranked Texas
Longhorns and the Pitt
Panthers face each other
Saturday, fans
will see teams
that mirror one
another.

Both teams
have been play-
ing for over 100

llT'HLET|CS

years.

Both teams are in a rebuild-
ing process with young players
at universities with high
expectations.

And both teams are always
bombarded with injuries to key
players.

“We had 21 players out of
our scrimmage last Thursday
night,” Texas head coach John
Mackovic said. “Which is
more than I can remember.

“We just had to get through
trying to patch up our unit.”

The one area of the team
Texas hopes will be ready by
this weekend is the defensive
unit, a defense which was one
of the worst in the nation last
year.‘Ranking 82nd in total
defense (giving up 401.4 yards
per game), 80th in rushing

defense (giving 194.4 yards
per game) and tied for 79th in
the turnover margin (-7).

To combat this problem the
Longhorns will go from their
basic 4-3 defensive lineup to a
3-4 against the Panthers, hop-
ing their overall team speed
will overpower the Panthers as
they key on Pitt running back
Curtis Martin.‘

This foursome of swift line-

‘ backers will be spearheaded by

Robert “Bobby” Reed, 21 6-
feet—2-inch, 227-pound terror.
In his junior season Reed is the
team’s top returning tackler
with a total of 88 stops last
season (second behind the
departed Winfred Tubbs who
racked up 138).

As one of Texas’ most con-
sistent defenders a year ago,
Reed is expected to be the
Longhorns leader at outside
linebacker come this weekend.

Reed’s biggest help should
come from senior inside
linebacker Kevin Watler. Last
year Watler lead Texas with
five pass breakups and
registered 54 tackles and 2.5
sacks.

As the most experienced
player on the team, Watler was
granted a rare sixth year of eli-

gibility due to a knee injury
that forced him to sit out a
semester of classes in 1991.

The other two starters are
senior Jim Bob Evans (6-0,
235) and junior Jason Reeves
(6-3, 210). ‘

Texas feels that reserve line-
backer Norman Walker will
benefit the most this week
against the Panthers.

“[Watkins] we put into the
games as a defensive end for
two years,” Mackovic said.
“He was clearly overmatched.
He was not able to show his
skills. We are now able to put
him in his right position.”

With Texas going to a new
set, the defensive line will be
composed of Tony “Big T”
Brackens, Stonie Clark and
Thomas Baskin.

Texas will look for the 6-4,
242-pound Brackens to give
Panther offensive tackle
Rueben Brown trouble. Last
year “Big T” was selected
South West Conference
Defensive Newcomer of the
Year as a true freshman. Also,
he was selected a consensus
first team all-SWC.

Hopefully for the
Longhorns, the explosive
Brackens will be too fast for

Brown to block, just like he
was for his opposition last
year. In 11 games last season
he was the Longhorns’ most
persistent pass rusher, posting
10 sacks on the year. He also
led Texas with 23 quarterback
pressures and shared the team
lead in tackles for a loss (6 for
-13 yards).

‘Clark, a junior noseguard, is
the biggest of the linemen
crew, standing at 6-1 and

"weighing 343 pounds. While

only starting six games last
year, Clark registered 30 tack-
les.

On the side of Clark will be
Baskin, a 6-2, 277-pound
senior from Riverside, Calif.
After making a smooth transi-
tion from tight end to defen-
sive tackle last season, he has
locked up the left defensive
tackle spot.

But the area that Texas
hopes that will present Pitt
with the most problems is the
defensive backfield where the
Longhorns return three starting
defensive backs.

Chris Carter, a sophomore
free safety, will be looked
upon to be the leader.

Last season as a true fresh-
man, Carter led the team with

four interceptions, was third
on the squad in tackles (85)
and had seven pass deflec-
tions.

Another defensive back to
watch will be Joey Ellis. The
senior last season battled
through injuries but still man-
aged to start all 11 games and
earn first team all-SWC at cor-
nerback.

Ellis, who is one of the
nation’s top man-to-man cover
men, will keep a close eye on
Diertich Jells.

With Ellis in the lineup this
might be a very physical game.
The other two starting DB’s
are Tre Thomas and Bryant
Westbrook.

Texas will look for the
defense to set the tempo in this
weekend’s game against Pitt.

Going into this season with a
different looking defensive
formation, the Longhorns have
very high expectations.

“[Texas] is one of the world
class academic universities,”
Mackovic said. “It’s football
program has had great success
for over 100 years, so with that
comes high expectations.
Everyone who comes here,
whether player or coach,
knows that.”

Texas‘ star quarterback brings his manytalentsto Pitt

Morenz
excels In

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

The Natural is coming to town
this weekend.

He will be dressed in burnt
orange and white -and sporting a
painted bull’s head on the side of
his helmet.

There will be no home runs
crushed into the lights, just
streaking receivers trotting into
the end zone.

Shea Morenz, the multi-
faceted Texas Longhorn quarter-
back is rounding up his team and
coming to Pitt Stadium on
Saturday for Pitt’s season opener
with all his big numbers and tal-
ents.

“Morenz can move around in
the pocket,” Pitt coach Johnny
Majors said. “He’s a good ath-
lete, strong and built. He’s got
good quickness and speed. He’s
a good leader and has experi-
ence.”

Morenz can do all that and a
lot more. He is statistically the
nation’s top returning sopho-
more quarterback, and could
possibly make a run at All-
American honors this season.

 

University of Texas Sports Infotion

All-American candidate Shea Morenz is the top returning
sophomore quarterback in the country. -

As a redshirt freshman last
year, Morenz set school records

for completions (183) and
attempts (335), and just missed

the single season yardage mark
with 2,341 and touchdowns (13).

In his starting debut against‘

Colorado, Morenz threw for 347
yards. He later went on to throw
for seven 200-yard games.
Morenz was the only freshman
to be ranked among the top 30
total offense performers nation-
ally.

“We are looking for him to
improve on a good ‘93 season,”
Texas head coach John

Mackovic said. “He’s real com- A

fortable with the system and
what we’re doing. He is in a
position where he can take con-
trol.

“He had a terrific spring and
fall.”

Morenz showed that there was
life without the best receiving
tandem in the country, Mike
Adams and Lovell Pinkney, this
fall. All Morenz did without the
duo in two games was complete
31 of 42 passes for 465 yards
and seven touchdowns.

Morenz is not just a strong
arm; the 6-feet—2-inch QB is also
known to be a powerful runner.

“He’s real tough,” Pitt line-
backer Tom Tumulty said. “He
doesn’t think twice about break-
ing a pocket and running down-
ﬁeld. We’ve been watching a lot
of films on him and he’s defi-
nitely not afraid to takea hit. I"
saw one time when he got lev-
eled and he just picked himself
up and went back to the huddle.

“We have our hands full. We
just have to give him some pres-
sure.”

Another quality that Morenz
possesses is that he is an

extremely intelligent quarter-
back. 1

‘‘He’s a quick learner,”
Mackovic said. “He’s a very
bright student. He understands
the offense real well and why we
are doing things.”

He was a member of Texas’
Athletic Directors Honor Roll, in
which a 3.0 Q.P.A. is required.
In high school, Morenz graduat-
ed l3th out of 650 kids in his
class.

But wait, there is more 
much more.

Last year, Morenz spent most
of his spring shuttling between
Memorial Stadium for football
practice and Disch-Faulk Field
for baseball.

Yes, Morenz is also a star
baseball player. As a sophomore
he hit .330 with eight homers
and 53 RBI as he blossomed
into the starting right fielder. He
earned third team All—America
honors from the National
Collegiate Baseball Writers’
Association. He led_ the
Longhorns in hits (75), RBI,
total bases (118) and slugging
percentage (.520).

Being the starting quarterback
as a freshman entails a lot of

pressure, but that is when’

Morenz excels.

For example, Morenz hit a
dramatic first pitch home run in
the top of the ninth inning
against Texas Tech in the
Southwest Conference semiﬁnal
game to break a 1-1 tie. Then in
the final game, Morenz hit the
game-winning single to get
Texas an automatic bid to the

-From page P-6

Mernagh, who is sitting out
after being diagnosed with
two different stress fractures
in her right leg.

“Stephanie has fit in phe-
nomenally well,” Alvear said.
“I have no idea how hard it is
to come into another country
to play. I don’t really under-
stand how hard it is to be
trained in one system and to
go into another system. She is
also dealing with a second lan-
guage, so I don’t think every-
one realizes the incredible
anxiety level that she is deal-
ing with.”

Pitt runs the five-one sys-
tem, which has one setter and
five players who rotate to their
various spots. This is similar
to what Dufresne is used to.
However, the timing of the
sets is different as is the height
of the sets. Another difference
is that Pitt uses a lot of audi-
bles, which means the hitters
call the set as the ball is being
passed, which iswhere the
language barrier comes into
play.

“Although the system is the
same, the way we run it is
tremendously different,”
Alvear said.

“Everyone is doing very
well,” Mernagh said. “We
have a lot of people coming
off major surgery, where if
they would have went too
hard, too fast, they’d be out,
but everyone basically is com-
ing back really well.”

Although hampered by
injuries, the volleyball team is
primed to play some good
competition.

“Illinois State recruits pri-
marily from the Chicago area
which has some of the best
ball in the country,” Alvear
said. “Those athletes play
from the time they were 12 to
14, so they have so much ball
control that even if they are
not the most physically talent-
ed, it is hard to terminate the
ball against them. Rhode
Island, I think, has most of
their people back, and it’s at
their home court.”

Even with all those factors
in the favor of their oppo-
nents, the confident Alvear
expects to win both matches
this weekend. “Both games
are going to be dogfights,”
Alvear said. “If we win in
anything less than four or five
games, then I will be
shocked.”

He was also selected in the sixth

But Morenz turned down a siz-

And here he is now.

He is coming to Pitt with his

led to the nicknames “Tex” and
“\V1ld Bill.”

“I’ve had fun with it,” he said.
“I admit that I am a little differ-
ent.”

Davis considers his college
career a success and has no
regrets that he brought his south-
western talent and individuality
to Pittsburgh.

“I will look back and say that I
am satisfied with the effort I
gave, especially my senior year,”
he said.

Davis, along with the rest of
the team, is looking forward to
the coming year and surpassing
last season’s three wins.

“The team is leaps and bounds

better than last year,” he said..
“We are stronger and more
aggressive in every position.” .

Despite the fact that the
Panthers face another murderous
schedule, Davis thinks that they
will be successful.

“It’s interesting, there’s a lot of
hype surrounding our schedule
and many people aren't giving

A us a chance,” he said.

Davis, who has set his sights
on All-Big East honors at wide-
out. will set aside all his personal
goals for the beneﬁt of the team.

“I’ll do whatever it takes to
help our team, whether it’s spe-
cial teams or receiver.”

Or maybe even punter.
