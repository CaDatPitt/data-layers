The lightsvshone down, highlight-

bells. The 2012 Laasya competition
had begun. ,
Pitt’s Indian classical dance
team, Nrityamala, hosted the four-
hour national dance competition
Saturday, which featured eight
premier collegiate teams from
across the East Coast. The event
drew more than 500 people and

Rather than dominating each

performers a mythological tem-

groups remained traditional, fea-

Parenthootl rallies forghirth control compromise

By Kelly Lyons .
Staﬁ" Writer

Under gray skies and the bare trees oftheW1lliam
Pitt Union lawn sat bright orange boxes ﬁlled
with 2,500 cups of Ramen noodles stacked on
top of each other around a table. ,

Atop the table, a petition to support the Af-
fordable Care Act’s birth control clause ﬂapped
inthe wind. , ‘ .. -

Pitt’s chapter’ of Vox, a student-outreach
program sponsored by Planned Parenthood,
spent $600 to bring the Ramen noodles to the
lawn. Group memberssaid the dollar value is
equivalent to the amount of money the average
American woman pays out of pocket armually
for birth control.

Friday, President; Barack Obamaarmounced a
compromise concerning birth control insurance
coverage. The original language ofthe Affordable
Care Act would have compelled all employers to
providebi_rth'control, astipulation that came un-

- derﬁrefro.rntheCatholicChurch,-whichwanted

to be exempt from having to pay for contracep-
tion for its employees.

Obama’s new planwouldn’t require religious
organizations to provide contraception free of
cost. Instead, it would spread the cost over all
policy holders. '

Abby Mundell, founder and president of the A
Pitt chapter of Vox —— which means “voice” 
Latin — said that it’s important that students:
know how health insurance is affecting their

everyday lives. _ . .
“Collegest11dents'shouldhave avoice~need
to have a voice,” Mundell, a junior, said.’ ’
. PlannedParenthoodofWesternPei1nsylvania

V contacted Mundelland her chapteron Wednes-‘

day to suggest that they hold their rally on Friday

’ to demonstrate to students -— primarily female

students —— what they could spend their money
on if they didn’t have to pay for birth control.
Mundell and her vice president saw that a
group at Ohio State University had used Ra-
men noodles to make the same‘ statement on

Wednesday. . '

Rebecca Cavanaugh, 31, of Swissvale and the

that she_was excited about students’ involvement
in the rally. . - l ‘

1 About 15 members of Pitt’s Vox chapter and
supporters ofthe group held signs at the corners
of Fifth Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard to entice

' students to check out the rally, take afree package

of Ramen noodles and sign a petition to show
their support for the Affordable Care Act.
Freshmen Conor Walsh was drawn to the

‘ display. “We saw all of the orange, and we were .

like, fWha_t’s with the noodles?”’. he said.
Upon hearing the news of the Affordable

Care.Act’s birth control clause, Walsh’s_ friend _

and fellow freshmen Alex Riggan spoke in sup-
port of the bill. “It sounds like a win-winrwin

situation. I learned sorneth1n_ '  and I got a cup ‘

of free noodles,” he said.

Sophomore.Briarma Mosley, a communica-
tions major, saw the demonstrators’ signs and
chose towalkover and sign the petition. “I think
that everyone‘ should have the choice to have it

- or not,” Mosley said;

But‘ Catholic employers ‘think they should
have the choice to decline to pay-for contracep-

; ltivesl, which the Church has always maintained -

are immoral.
Seniorjeremy Paff, president of the Catholic

~ ‘Newman Clubat Pitt, said that he could not sup-
‘ port the bill’s'amended version either.

Paff said that the compromise would force

“material cooperation”. on the part of the Church a

because the cost for the Catholic employees’ birth
control would be spread out over all policy hold-

’ ers, meaning the Church would still indirectly

pay for birth control. ’

Pitt Occupiers discuss how to keep the movement alive

By Michael Ringling ;
Staff Writer V

There were ‘no tents, no campsite, no land to
reclaim —.— but there were Occupiers.

About 15 students from Occupy Pitt met for
their fourth_weekly general assembly meeting
_Friday afternoon in a dark corner of Posvar
Hall at the old Forbes Field home plate. The
Occupiers discussed a multitude of issues,

' rangingfromUniversityﬁ1ndingtotheIsraeli-
‘Palestinian conﬂict. ' -

Occupy Pitt’s ‘members stand in solidar-,
ity with the other Occupy movements, which

started with Occupy Wall Street in Septem-

ber. The student group formed injanuary as a

more education—focused branch of the Occupy '

movement. '
Occupy Pittsburgh,whose members joined
in Occupy Pitt’s ﬁrst on—campus demonstration

, at the beginning of the month, peacefully left
‘ their encampment on Mellon Green Downtown

Wednesday —~ two days afterthe Monday evic-

tion deadline issuedby the Allegheny County '
Court of Common Pleas that ordered the group

‘ . to clear off BNY Mellon’s property.

Occupy Pitt mem'ber_]_ames Simkins said

_ thatasthe Occupy movements move awayfrom '
- theirencampments,theoccupierswillcontinue

spreading their message, protesting a number
of issues including economic inequality.

On Pitt’s campus, although the Occupy Pitt ‘
. students stand in solidarity, each member of

the group made it clear that‘ he or she could

only speak for himself or herself and notfor.

the movement as a whole.

“We are all very much free thinkers, so ev- _ ’ f 

erything is a debate,” Lucas Lyons, a member
of Occupy Pitt, said. “It’s. built sopeople: are

able to compromise.” / ._ j

these women can do that and practice and
have a full course load is amazing. There
are really no shortcuts to what is on stage
here,” he said.

The night featured other Pittsburgh dance
groups — Steel City Bhangra, PantherRaas,
the Pitt Ballet Club and three other South
Asian and African dance groups —— whose
members performed but did not compete.

At the end of the night, four judges com-
piled scores based on music, synchroniza-
tion, choreography, technique, mastery of

story and theme. They then awarded ﬁrst,

second and third place ﬁnishes and the con-
geniality award. .

Rutgers’ team walked away with third
place, and Duke placed second. The Universi-
ty of Maryland’s team, Moksha, captured the
audience with its visualization of expression,

an essential component of Indian dance, and A

received ﬁrst place for its efforts. _

Moksha depicted vignettes of four women
expressing powerful emotions: love, fear,
sorrow, anger and peace. In addition to re-
turning home with the ﬁrst—place trophy,
Maryland’s team was also awarded the con-
geniality award, recognizing the team’s coop-
eration and pleasant disposition throughout
the competition. ’ _ S .

“For all the work we put in, extra prac-

tices, and how they brought it all to the
stage — we’re just so proud,” said Vishney
Ambalavanar, one of the captains of Mary-
land’s team. » _
The Maryland team, which also won the
competition in 2010, impressed Kumar.
“Clearly they did a very good job ~— you
could see [the emotions], all the expres-
sions on their faces. Everything was very well
done. It all came together,” she said. '
Ramya Tallapragada, a Maryland team
captain, was excited with her team’s suc-
cess. »
“Expressing the culture as well as bring?
ing it to a level that can be appreciated by any
audience — that’s what we’re really trying

“Peace is the neutral road,” Lyons said.
Although members of Occupy Pitt had dif-
fering opinions about advertising the event and
did not make a deﬁnitive decision regarding
the proposal, no voices of dissent arose when
discussing making Pitt more transparent.
Senior Eric Reidy, a history and global stud-
ies major, encouraged facilitating conversation
between the University and the students.

V “People don’t even know how to raise these
questions because we are so isolated from the
process,” Reidy said about the University’s fund-
ing practices. “Students should be engaged and
included in theconversation and environment
surrounding their education  have it built into
the structure that students are equal players.”

He cited current methods inlplace through
which students can interact with the adminis-
tration, such as the Student Government Board
and Dean’s Hour. He said that it is important
that students take advantage of those avenues

‘of discussion.

Before the end of the meeting, the Occupiers

‘ broke into three working groups.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

What collegereally taught me

Mark Kozlowski reflects on the lessons his future self would fmd most valuable

I I w ‘ Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

By lvlark Kozlowski
‘ L Columnist

  

After spending all that money
and taking on all that debt
to attend a University, you’re
probably asking yourself,
“What did I really learn?”

'As I descend into seniori-
tis, I’ve started to ponder this

question largely to avoid focus— '

ing on something productive.
But in allserioupsness, thisis a

good time to internalize some.

of the lessons I’ve learned’,
because they’re- easy to forget
later on. Aging means distanc-'

I ing yourself from your past
- experiences; I’m continually

amazed.’ by how many adults
forget what they had learned
when they were younger. When
I’m old, _I might have influence,
responsibilities and a couple of
teenagers I‘don’t understand to
distract me. So I hope you’ll in-
dulge my open letter to myself
30 years in the-future, which
will ensure that I don’t forget
the important things I learned
in-college. ' ‘-

., EVE? FOQGET TO
 PAQTY HAQD.’

The lesson I most hope to
retain is that teenage problems

' aren’t stupid. I coach speech at

a high school, and I marvel at
how much people worry about
colleges — I, for one, turned
out to be perfectly happy at a
school I wasn’t initially even
considering. Other miscel-
laneous teenage .angst makes‘
similarly little sense at first.
Upon ‘mature reflection, how-
ever, I realize I felt such angst
as well. It_ seems pretty insig-

nificant now, but at the time .

my problems were the most
important things that had ever_
happened to_me. _I just hadn’t
lived much of my life yet. Ado-
lescent issues might not matter
much in the cosmic scheme of
things, but your average high

—schooler lacks the experience,

perspective and hormonal con-
trol to realize th°at. In light of

this, a lot of teenagers’ con— '

cerns are real and valid and
shouldn’t be dismissed as “sil-'
ly” by adults. ' ‘

I also hope I don’t forget two
lessons by dint of becoming
more inﬂuential. After achiev-
ing something wonderful, we

«

often glow with satisfaction
and say, “I did it all by myself.
I don’t owe anybody anything.”
Wrong. Sure, there are some
things you can accomplish com-_

‘ pletely independent of anybody
Aelse’s efforts. But when it comes

to lifetime achievements, no-

«bodyever got where they are

without owing somebody. You
could have phenomenal talent
and a great work ethic, but it
might take somebody else, be
it a professor or a manager, to
recognize that talent and drive
and either help you develop it

or direct you tosomeone who.

can. This.could entail some-
thing as simple as obtaining a

'letter of reference or introduc-

ing yourself to someone. Yes,
you can take credit for all the
great things you did, but many
of them were only made pos-
sible by other people. _
The second lesson is that
being rude to your retainers
reflects poorly on you. For in-
stance, someone who"s-nice to
you but rude to the waiter at a
restaurant is not a nice person.

time out of his schedule to meet with
the lowly summer interns. Ifvl do ever
end up as somebody’s boss or other of-
‘ ficial, I hope I’ll remember this. '

Finally, I’ve sat through a number

of meetings in college during which
I either didn’t understand what was
going on'or otherwise had a burning
question that Iwas sure would make
me look silly. And yet"I’ve found that
what might seem like a stupid question
may in fact be a good one. Oftentimes,
‘people develop tunnel vision, fixating

_ on particular details but losing sight of
others. Until those details are brought
to their attention by asimple question
that they can’t answer, they may con-

tinue to ignore them. Alternately, there
might be all sorts of very specific de-

tails that don’t necessarily cohere into

a bigger picture._Sometimes nobody
asks anyone to do this, as it’s assumed
that if you know the details, you must
know thelarger picture. So although

-it might not be a good idea to blurt

out what you think is a dumb question
in front of a large audience, it’s often
worth asking somebody at some point.
Your question might be smarter than
you realize. A .
And by the way, all of the most valu-

Former plysnalyz

By Brian Batko .
For The Pitt News

Just three weeks ago, as Gilbert
Brownwatched his fonnerteamlose

- its eighth game in a row, he sat back

and tried to analyze what was wrong
with this year’s Pitt ‘men’s basketball
team. c

The Panthers weren’t executing.
They weren’t playing with conﬁ-
dence. They weren’t winning.

Brown — who never played on
a Pitt team that ﬁnished with more
than 10 losses in his four years as a
Panther — is one of many former
players who are scratching their
heads over a relatively dismal sea-
son thus far. ’

While many of them are now
working, playing or coaching some-
where far from Oakland, they stay
connected to the program by‘ ex-
changing text messages and tweets
with the current players and, of
course, watching the games.

“I’m only one year removed from
the program, so you just sit andwatch
and wonder, like, ‘Where’d it go?’ —_——
that attitude that we had,” Brown
said.

But Brown — a 2011 Pitt graduate

who started at forward every game
for lastyear’s Big East regular-season
champions — won’t entertain the
notion that the Panthers,"now trying
to claw their way back into the NCAA
Tournament picture after dropping
their last two. contests, are lacking
in talent.

“It’s deﬁnitely not a talent is-'

sue,” Brown said. “Every kid on this
team right now has the talent to be
a Division I player. It’s never a-talent
issue.” V

Brown sees some similarities be-

tween the 2011-2012 Panthers that

struggled without injured point
guard Travon Woodall for almost
two months and the 2009-2010
team that started the season, with-
out himself or senior guardjermaine
Dixon. Dixon missed the ﬁrst nine
games with a right foot injury while
Brown was serving a semester-long
suspension.

“It was tough in the beginning
when Jermaine was hurt, but then
we got our conﬁdence bac ,” Brown
said, though he was also quick to
point out the differences between
the two situations, as well. - .,

‘ “It’s kind of hard to look back on
that season and compare the two be-
cause we weren’t picked in the top 25

‘to start the season, while [this year’s .

team] started off ranked high and
kind of fell off,” he said.

Julius Page, a former guard who '

graduated in 2004 and is the 15th
leading scorer in school history,
noted that times have changed since
his days as a Panther, when the Pitt
basketball program was largely over-
looked and underestimated. Nowthe
team is expected to be among the
nation’s elite each year, perhaps on
reputation alone. ‘

“It’s allot different from us be-
cause we pretty much started it from
the beginning,” Page said. “These
‘guys, they’re sponsored by Nike. We
had Adidas, we had to start out with
the worst of the worst shoes. And
I think everybody on my team had
some kind of chip on their shoul-
ders.” ' -

Ever since players like Page and

current Pitt assistant coach Brandin '

Knight helped turn the basketball
program aroundinthe early 2000s,

Pitt teams have typically beenknown '

for their toughness, hustle and physi-
cal style of play. Given some of this
season’s perplexing losses, manyfans

and basketball experts wonderif the .

Pitt’s NCAA Tournament 
chances weaken with loss 1

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Pitt’s hopes of recovering from

5 an 0-7 start in the Big East and
reaching the NCAATournament
dimmed considerablyon Saturday
as the Panthers fell on the road to
Seton Hall in their second straight
loss,

The return of starting point
guard Travon Woodall -— who suf-
fered abdominal and groin injuries
in November — had seemed to
be the answer for the struggling
Pitt men’s basketball team. The
Panthers won four of ﬁve games
following Woodall’s return on

Jan. 21, including a home win over

then—No. 9 Georgetown.
But Pitt’s four-game winning
streak ended with a loss to South

v

Florida on Wednesday, and the

Panthers followed that defeat with .~ .

the 73-66 loss to ‘Seton Hall (17—8,
6-7 Big East) on Sunday, dropping
their overall record to 15-11 and
their conferencerecord to 4-9.

Pitt’s record quickly improved
from 0-7 to 4—7in the Big East
once’ Woodall returned, catch-
ing national attention and caus-
ing analysts and fans to dissect
the team’s chances of making the
NCAA Tournament.

Most came to the conclusion

» that if the Panthers could ﬁnish

the year with a 9-9 record in the
Big East and make a solid show-
ing in the Big East Tournament,

they would become the ﬁrst Big

East team to start 0-7 in confer-
ence play and still earn an NCAA

Panthers earn comeback
 wrnuverﬂofstra

By Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

Pitt sophomore wrestler P.]. Tasser
_scored a takedown with 17 seconds
remaining in the period and, to
yells from his coaches and team-
mates, held on to 'Hofstra’s ninth-
ranked Ben Clymer for the 2-1
victory. — l -

His win gave Pitt a 15-12 lead, '
"i and the Pitt wrestling team ulti-

mately ﬁnished with a 22-12 vic-
tory over No. 22 Hofstra on Friday.
The win marked Pitt’s fourth over a
ranked team this season and 10th
straight overall.

Tasserwas inserted into the
lineup at 184 pounds on" a late
decision by ‘Pitt wrestling head
coach Rande Stottlemyer. Tasser
wrestled at 174 pounds for a good

‘portion of the season while senior
Ethan Headlee was out with an in-
jury. Tasser said he was just happy

. to help the team get another win.

“It means a lot to me to be able

‘to contribute to the team in any
way,” Tasser said. “I was nervous
at ﬁrst wrestling the ninth-ranked

guy. Once I got out there on the
mat‘ and started wrestling, I got
into a rhythm.”

Clymer moved into the top 10 in
the rankings after defeating Cor-
nell’s third-ranked wrestler a week
before the match with Pitt.

“Getting that takedown late was

huge,”-Tasser said. “I was losing by X‘

a point but kept forcing the action.
I ﬁnally got a good shot and did
what I had to do to ﬁnish.”

The Pitt coaching staff moved
No. 32 Andy Vaughan and No. 4

.Matt Wilps_up a weight class to L,

give the team its best chance of
winning.

“It was great for P._]. to get a win
like that,” Pitt assistant coach Ja-
son Peters said in a release on Pitt’s
website. “It was an opportunity for
him to help the team, and he came
through.”

No.22 Hofstra started hot
against the No. 9 Panthers, win-

. ning the ﬁrst three matches. Five of

the ﬁrst six weight classes "featured

ranked wrestl_ers for the Pride, =3

and Pitt struggled early against
Hofstra’s top wrestlers.

Pitt shows improvement
111 close loss to Cmcmnatl

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team stayed
close to Cincinnati until the'final buzzer
on Saturday but couldn’t come up with its
first Big East win. ' ’
The Panthers fell to the Bearcats 62-
57 for their 10th straight loss, but, in a
change from recent games, Pitt managed
“We played fora full 40 minutes an
didn’t have any lapses today,” head coach
Agnus Berenato said. “We started [the]
game strong, and [the] game was back--
and-forth. ‘There were 11 lead changes,

and that’s the kind of game in February V '

you have to have.” I

Pitt (8-16, 0-11 Big East) never let Cin-'

cinnati (13-12, 4-8 Big East) extend its lead
to double digits,.and the largest Bearcat
lead was by seven points in the second
half. - » ’
Pitt went into the half down three

points, 28-25, but the Panthers kept the"

Bearcats from running away out of the
break. The Cincinnati le‘ad grew to seven
at the beginning of_the second half before
Pitt began to chip away at it. -
Pitt wrestled the lead from the Bearcats
to grab aV49-4N8 advantage with less than
six minutes to go in the game but surren-
dered it almost immediately on back-to-

back buckets- from Cincinnati senior guard .-

Bjonee Reaves. - ._

Reaves’ baskets gave the momentu
back to Cincinnati. The Panthers cut the
lead down to four with 2:30 to go on a
Marquel Davis jumper, _but that’s as close
as Pitt would get. A - — - .

V Both Ashlee Anderson and Davis fouled
out as Pitt attempted to orchestrate a’
comeback, leaving theteam without two
of its biggest offensive threats.

Pitt turned the ball over six times in
the remaining minutes but also shot 50
percent from the ﬁeld.

The Bearcats shot 52.4 percent in the

Increased offensive production helpe
Pitt keep the game competitive. Four Pitt
players reached doublejﬁgures, ’

The two teams traded the lead eight
times during the first half, and the largest
lead in the period was a ﬁve—point Cincin-
nati advantage. '

Redshirt sopliomore Leeza Burdgess
— Pitt’s only active center following the
season—ending injury to Cora McManus a
month ago — dominated down low. .

Burdgess cleaned the glass, grabbing a

career-high 16 rebounds. She also scored.

10 points, collecting her third double-
double this season.

With a front line depleted by injuries,
Pitt’s guards needed to carry the team. An-

, “We played for
‘a ‘full 40 minutes
and didn’t have
any Iapsestoolay.
1   We lstarted [the].
game strong, and  

A [the] game was

back-and—forth.”
' -Agnus Berenato  

d_erson, Davis and freshman Brianna Kiesel

ﬁnished in double ﬁgures with 15 points,

13 points and 13 points, respectively.
Berenato said she has noticed a change

i in the play of the guards over the past‘

week. ~

“Our guards — we_ challenged them in
practice. They were more ﬂuid this week.
They had to make shots over the [male .
practice players] in practice,” Berenato said
in a release on Pitt’s website. “I thought to-
day they didn’t hesitate on their shots, and
it showed in a much better effort.”

Unfortunately for the Panthers, Cincin-
nati’s guards came to play as well.’ '

Reaves led all scorers with 19-points,
while fellow senior Chanelchisholm and

redshirt sophomore Dayeesha Hollins ‘

provided support with 14 and 15 points,
respective y. ‘

Cincinnati head coach Jamelle Elliott
said she didn’t overlook ‘Pitt despite its
poor conference record. This time last year,
the Bearcats were in the midst of an equally
rough stretch. ‘ ' 3

“Last year  we.’d lost [15].games in

«a row, and I tried to motivate my play-

ers every game to play hard,” Elliott said.
“Agnus did the same thing [today]. I knew
that they were going to play hard all 40
minutes, and they did.”

Pitt has ﬁve regular-season games left
to try and pick up a Big East win, starting
with a home game against Louisville on
Tuesday. Q‘

ningofthe end of that mentality.

Jaron Brown, who graduated with Page in:

2004 and still watches every game, isn’t quite
ready to go that far, but he can understand such
sentiments.

“I think it’s just a different era now,” Brown -.

said. “We may have been alittle bittougher, but
we were trying to make a name.forourselves and
the University of Pittsburgh. They’re'already

« there so they might not be playing as hard.” ,

_ Brown, who many consider to be the

quintessential blue-collar Panther of the early A‘
2000s, is sure that head coach Jamie Dixon '

hasn’t changed his approach but realizes that
it might not be enough. _ ' .
‘,‘In due time, everybody’s due for a bad

. season,” Brown said. “This might just be their

9! -

year.
When the Panthers defeated West Virginia

on the road two weeks ago, Brown’s former ' I
.teammate, Page, had other ideas. Page went

as far as to tweet after the game, “This team is
battle tested and WILL go to [the] ﬁnal 4.”

“I really believe that,” Pagesaid, insisting
that it wasn’t just a declaration made in the heat
of the moment_. “Me, being around sports for a
long time, especially college basketball, I’m not
shocked by anything. When you see a team like

Butler who was an"eight or nine seed last year go .

to the national championship game and a team
like Connecticut that just got hot at the right

time, you just feel like any team, once they’re in ’

[the NCAA Tournament], they have a shot.”
Gilbert Brown, who, having been in a Pan-
thers uniforrn only 11 months ago, knows this

1 team as well as anyone, isn’t about to count this

team out, either. _.
“They just need to have a sense ofurgency

' of where the team is right now and what they

can still possibly do to save it,” Brown said. “If
they do that, they can end up still having a pretty
nice run and possibly do somethingtowards the
end of the season.” i ' 0 '

Tournament bid. .
But now, with ﬁve games left in con-
- ference play, the Panthers have already
reached nine losses and need to go unde-
feated in order to ﬁnish the year at .500 in
the Big East. -

Pitt looked like it was going to pull
away in the second half against Seton Hall.
With the score tied at 51 and 12:11 left in
the game, Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs scored

, eight consecutive points — interrupted by
two free throws from the Pirates — and.
forward Nasir Robinson added a layup to

give the Panthers a 61-55 lead with 8:12
remaining. .

But the Pirates answered with a 10-0
scoring run following a-timeout that made
the score 65-61 in favor of Seton Hall with
4:44 left on the clock. 1

. The Panthers fought back, and," with 1:27
left on the clock, Seton Hall’s Brandon Mob-

_ley fouled Gibbs on a 3-point shot attempt.

Gibbs sank all three foul shots to trim the
Seton Hall advantage to one point, 67-66.
But the Pirates’]ordan Theodore found
Herb Pope cutting to the basket on the Pi-
rates’ next possession, and Pope scored
an uncontested layup. Pitt took over pos-

session down three points with 27 seconds-
remaining, but Woodall turned the ball over .

and Robinson was called for an intentional

foul on Pope.

Pope sank four free throws in the ﬁnal
seconds to seal the game for the Pirates.

Gibbs ﬁnished the game with 26 points
total after scoring 15 of the Panthers’ last 
19 points. Lamar Patterson also reached’
double ﬁgures for the Panthers, adding 15
points.

Pope and guard Aaron Cosby led Seton
Hall with 19 points each, and Pope also
grabbed 14 rebounds. Theodore added 15
points and nine assists. ‘ _C

The Panthers will look to start a new
winning streak when they take_on West
Virginia on Thursday in the second install-
ment of the Backyard Brawl at the Petersen
