Congress Probes I1"-ood Service

/-

By ED JENSEN

The cost of college living is not what it
used to be. Four years on the campus now
calls for an investment that our forefathers
never dreamed possible.

A brief survey of food prices, room rents
and student wages in the Oakland area con-

ﬁrmsthe theory the inﬂation is_here to stay,

It also shows that while the Cafeteria takes
a prettylarge bite for a meal, it isn’t the
only place. If things continue rising as they

have we will all be using wheelbarrows in-

stead of purses and wallets. .
Probably food is the most expensive item
in the student budget. You can get a fairly
decent meal in the Cafeteria for around $1.25.
This, let it be understood, is simple fare.

Spaghetti sans Meatballs , ’

' If you -like spaghetti you can start buy-
ing at 60 cents. The average price, however,
for eight eating places in Oakland is 65 cents.
This usually includes bread and _butter but

oysters in a- dinner while others have ﬁve
and four. Few of the places offer dessert
with their oyster dinners.

After eating out a few times most stu-
dents will decide to wait‘ until they. get back
home for a steak dinner. Most places that
bother to carry it on the menu begin by
oﬁferinga minute steak for $1.25. They then
offer a club steak for $1.65, silroin for $2.25
and ﬁlet mignon for $2.50.

Coﬂee F luctuates ' -
Coffee generally retails for ten cents.

’ There are three places that sell it for seven

cents and one for a ‘nickel. In most eateries
it is included with the meal, or there is a\
reduction if it is bought along with food.
Room rents are relatively modest. On
Neville St. you can start with a room at 7
dollars a week and go as high as 40 dollars

. a month. H
There is one room that rents for 65 dol-

lars on Chelton Ave. On South Ave. you can

Measure Snagged in House

Loyalty Oath Bill Still Pending

The controversial loyalty oath bill is still pending in¢

Harrisburg today. Since September 27 the bitterly contested
bill, passed last March by the State Senate, has been await-
ing apparent conﬁrmation by the Houseiof Representatives.

The House bill has
amendments in addition to the
original bill which had required
oaths from state—supported school
teachers. The bill now does not
require loyalty oaths from teach-
ers in state-aided colleges. Instead
it would require the presidents of
these institutions to report once
a year on what they are doing to
keep subversives off their facul-
ties.

Seyler Measure Defeated‘

Rep. Harry E. Seyler,» ‘York
Democrat, oﬁered amendments to
put all teachers on the same basis
by eliminating loyaty oaths alto-
gether. The move was defeated
109 to 56. , ‘

‘ Rep. Hiram G. Andrews, Johns-
town Democrat, and GOP House
leader Charles C. Smith tried to
kill the bill by sending it back to
committee. They lost 115 to 49.

Veterans groups have favored
the bill from the start. Educators
have generally opposed the meas-
ure. Organizations such as the

Deans Okay

  ‘Rally Hours

‘K

Deans of the undergraduate
schools have approved a request
from Student Congress to have
classes dismissed for four pre-
game and post—game rallies dur-
ing the semester.

One pre-game rally has already
been held in connection with the
Pitt-Duke game.

.One fourth hour class will be
dismissed for a pre-game assem-

~_ bly and one second and one third

hour class on Mondays may be
dismissed for assemblies after
“signiﬁcant” victories.

" _. ‘The, offices of the dean of men

and‘ women, together‘ with. Student

several¢

American Civil Liberties Union
and Students for Democratic Ac-
tion have also bitterly opposed it.

From the voting last week it ap-
pears the “educator’s righters” are
losing out.

The bill, as it was originally
proposed in the Senate by Albert
Pechan, would have required all
teachers in state—supported insti-
tutions to take an oath that they
did not advocate the violent over-
throw of the government, that
they would swear to uphold the
constitutions of the United States
and Pennsylvania.

“Subversive” is Catch

Opponents had pointed out that,

the real danger in the bill lay in
the deﬁnition of a “subversive” or-
ganization. ‘They also pointed out
that the persons who were deter-
mining‘ just what “subversive”
out that any loyal American

meant use the Billas a political
weapon. ~»

Supporters of the Bill pointed
out that loyal
would have no compunctions about
signing such an Oath. They held
that the Bill only required the in-
dividual to put down on paper
wh'at'he felt. If he was guilty, he
would refuse to sign.

To this opponents pointed out

that a Communist would not have
any hesitation about putting his
name down. '

Chancellor Hits Bill ‘

In open hearings in Harrisburg
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
warned that the bill gave wide
authority to the Attorney-General
in "deﬁning subversive. This
authority, the chancel_lor said,
“would make it possible for him
to evercise control over research
and teaching in Universities.”

Dr, Fitzgerald was joinedin his
opposition by presidents of other
state—supported colleges and Uni-
versities. Lobbyists for the Bill
were primarily the veterans
groups.

Sixty Pledge Blood

Student Congress’ all-out drive for enough pledges to
bring a Red Cross Bloodmobile unit to Pitt today .was con-

Already the drive, which began

yesterday, has netted 60 of the‘

352 pledges necessary to bring
the blood team to Pitt for two
days, Nov. 1 and 2.

Twelve organized groups of four

students each will do the active

To Check Prices

An investigating trend swept Student Congress Mon-
day‘ when motions were made to answer student questions
about the University Food Service, and to find out exactly
how the $12.50 University fee is used. . _

Vice President Bob Gardner moved that Student Con-
gress form a committee to seek answers to current student
-questions about the Cafeteria and Tuck Shops. He stressed

And the "increased trolley fares make no_
small dint in the budget. This coupled with
the higher price for both men and women’s

that this would not be a criticalé

fact-ﬁnding committee, but that
its purpose would be informative.
Only One Objection

He was backed by Jack Bur-
Winkle, Men’s Council president,
who added, “There are a lot of
unanswered questions asked by
students. As their representatives,
we should make an attempt to
answer them.”

The ‘motion was passed over
the lone objection of Nancy
Tear, WSGA president. Gard-
ner, named chairman, promised
quick action and a report of in-
formation next week.

The motion to investigate the
University fee was made and with-
drawn after lengthy comment by
most ofithe members present. Dis-
cussion revealed that not even the
advisers present had similar ideas
as to how the fee is -"broken down
and used.

‘ No One Knows

Burwink1e,‘who so moved, said
he did so on request of several
students, and added, “No one, not
even members of the dean of men
and women’s oﬂicesknow where
the money goes. It’s our duty to
ﬁnd out.” A

B ob Gardner, throwing the
monkey wrench -which ﬁnally led
to the withdrawing of the motion,
insisted that “such investigation
shouldn’t be done just to ﬁnd out,
but only if we feel it (the use) is
being misused.‘

‘The Air Force at Pitt has expanded.

A new Air ROTC division has opened at Johnstown Cen-

Engineering Executive
Calls Attention to New

Shortage of

Personnel

By IRENE ROZAKIS
“Don’t go into engineering. Its a crowded ﬁeld.” That
seems to be the advice that most parents have been giving
to their oﬁspring for the past twenty years.

But there is at least one parent¢

in the country who‘ knows bet-
ter. - I

Carey H". Brown ought to know
better. He’s chairman of the En-
gineering Manpower Commission,
an organization that is currently

spending a great deal of time in

trying to convince the nation of
the alarming lack of American
engineers. ,
v Technological Age ,

“We are just entering the tech-
nological age. Everything before
it was just preparation,” remarked

, Mr. Brown at an Engineering Con-
vocation which drew 600 repre-‘

sentatives of American industry,
the engineering profession, college
educators, and Pittsburgh second-
ary schools to the Stephen Foster
Memorial last Friday.

Mr. Brown went on to explain
that there are two reasons for the
shortage of engineers. At the
present time defense work is in
high gear, and this means that
there is more need for competent

. engineering experts.

In addition, there have been so
many advances in civilian pro-
duction methods that the present
dwindling supply of engineers
cannot handle all the new com-
plications.

West Point Grad

Brown, a graduate of West
Point, is a man_ who knows‘ his
way around the engineering busi-
ness. At present an executive of
the Eastman Kodak Company, he
was in charge of the Holston' Ord-
nance. Works during World War

  THIS

II. Although this company manu-
factured all types of explosives,
its most important contribution
was “Composition B,” a substance
which made American torpedoes
much more effective and'helped
to bring about a faster destruc-
tion of the German ﬂeet.

Mr. Brown stressed the need
for more young people in the ﬁeld
of engineering, and hastened to
add that there are plenty of op-
portunities for women. He con-

cluded with, “The enemy has more

men .than we do. Thus, it isn’t

how many men we have, but what -

kind of equipment. That’s the
point of View that the engineer
must have." '

FOOTBALL MOVIES SHOWN

Movies of .Pitt’s football
games will be shown in
Stephen Foster Memorial dur-
ing 3rd and 5th hours ‘every
Thursday. The first ﬁlm, the
Pitt-Duke game, will be shown
this Thursday.

Members and prospective mem-
bers of the Wesley Fellowship will

the funds is invalid since it’s likely
to be biased.” He added, “We
may hurt ourselves by baring our
fangs and forming a committee to
investigate this, when all we have
to do is ﬁnd and ask an informed
source.”

It was generally decided that
Congress should not do any fact
ﬁnding in this realm unless infor-
mation about the fee uses was deﬁ-
nitely refused.

Social Committee Projects

Social Committee Chairman Jim
Johnston requested $125 for the
purchase of an indoor P-A system
to be rented out at a nominal
price to both student and outside
organizations.

. .Rules set by Johnston for use

include a-$5 rental and a $15 de-
posit for campus. organizations,
and a $10" rental and a $25 deposit
for off—campus groups. A Pitt man
will operate the system at a cost
of $1 per hour tothe organization.
Approximately 50 tickets have -
been sold for the Michigan State
trip, as estimated by Bob Gard-
ner. He added that nearly 100
are promised to date, and that
“ticket sales are going reason-
ably well.” ,
Advisor A1 Payne reminded
Congress members that nomina-
tions for the Pitt Chest drive chair-
man were open. He asked for
suggestions.

The habit of drinking has o_ccupied some of our best
minds both here on the campus and in the nation at large
as well as through the “corridors of time.” So let us take
_a look at what the various sages have had to say about -the
vice or virtue. _‘
I Epictetus maintained that “he is a drunkardwho takes
-.more than three glasses, though he be not ‘drunk.’ .
O Bertrand Russell, a gentleman who has had much to
say for this century, comes put with the statement that‘

happin_ess.’’ \

Perhaps the student who was evicted on Saturday took

” ’ this as advice and tried to blot out the sadness of impend-

ing defeat with the grape. Who knows? One thing is cer-
‘ tain, he has a lot of unhappiness before him with the DOM.
‘ Or this annonymous Bacchus may have been heeding
John Fletcher who "has this to say: ' ‘ -.

‘fDrink today, and drown all sorrow;

“You shall perhaps not do it tomorrow.”

Deﬁnitely against University regulations.

There is one thing certain about it, Isaiah, in the Bible,
would have come out four square for the drinkban. He
has gone on record with “woe unto them that rise up early
in the morning that they may follow strong drink; that
' . continue.until night, till wine enﬂame them.” ’

_..t? It was wine they were drinking at the Stadium, wasn’t

J eﬁersonalikewiseopposed the use of alcohol. He said
< “I would askrespecting a candidate for oﬁice . . . Does he
use ardent sprits?” ,

But that carefree spirit Omar Khayyam, as might be
expected, not only has nothing against drinking in the Sta-
? - dium, he is in favor of it. He urges: _ .

 “Drink! for youiknow not whence you came, \
nor why: . g _

“Drink! for you know not why, nor where.”

He has led many a student astray.

Thoreau has made the eminently sensible observation
that “water is the only drink for the wise man.”- ' «

To which W. C. Fields has replied, “VVater. It trusts your
_‘ \ pipes.” ‘ ,,
But in the ﬁnal analyses, since it is against University
regulations and since in thepast excessive drinking has
proven to result in unpleasantness andmisfortune, we feel
that there should be no drinking at the Stadium.‘ It is more

 or less a duty for us to act in the stands as though we were

As most of the natives_. hereabouts ‘know, the

for its annual convention.‘ There was much speech-

vigorous oppositionto u_n-Amer- '

wasparticularly apt. . 
It may be said that Sen. Martin . _ .

has occasionally had aspersions cast upon his Am-
ericanism record by people whogregard himfas a
hired wretch forformer senator Joe Grundy. They
say he is nothing more than a fumbling gob of
ﬂabby fatuousness, a sort of political’ Charlie Mc-
Carthy. D
Fodder for Ambition

The Judge has also suffered because some hint
that" his active opposition to Communism‘ islsome—
thing less than sincere. They attribute it to an un- _
bounded ambition. I-lis frequent denunciations, they

 

_ say, are merely fodder for his political aspirations.

But regardless of the gainsayers these two ﬁg-
ures \had much to say. They were particularly
damning of education which is the only reason they
are worthy of note here. a '

After the delegates had tabled a measure to in-
vestigate Penn Statefor alleged subversive activity,
they adopted one which called for an investigation
of “all and every” state-aided college for possible
Communist inﬁltration. The Legionnaires con-

curred unanimously.

The Senator Speaks .

Then up for discussion came thecontroversial
loyalty oath bills Outspoke the senior senator from
Pennsylvania. He said:

“I cannot understand why an_y.real American‘
should refuse to stand up and declare publicly that
he is not associated with any Communist group or
any other organization "that advocates the over-
throw of our government by violence.” V

. He warned that “we must not close our eyes to
the increased spread of Communist doctrines upon
the campuses of many of our institutions of higher
learning.” O . x -

First_ of all Sen. Martin has overlooked the fact
that no one refusedto stand up and deny he was '
a Communist. Next he-merely said we must “not
close our eyes to the increased spread of Communist
doctrines.” -

Where Are the Comhiies?

Just where is this increased spread of‘ Com-

munist doctrine taking place. Certainly not on this

A recent New York Times survey of the college
enrollment situation has Dr. Guy Snavely, .execu—
tive head of the Association of American Colleges,
on record against the proposal that the federal
government help “poor but able” students through
college.

His attitude that this sort of thing could menace
the democratic form of ‘govern
ment is as shortsighted as it is
trite and unimaginative.

GI Bill Discriminates
_ If Dr. Snavely is really wor-
ried about menacing democracy,

lax. The issue of, federal aid to
college students was decided
long ago when the ﬁrst GI Bill’
of Rights became law. That bill
ostensibly maintained its “democratic” standing by
offering free education to all vets regardless of
their ﬁnancial status, but -in reality it did dis-
It allowed a lot
of GI’s to get an education who otherwise could
not have afforded it, while those from the better-
heeled families would have gotten one. anyway.
So far, .at least, we’ve been able to ﬁght off
that menace. -

More to the point is the relation Dr.’Snavely’s
remark bears to the national manpower picture.

fective people from General Hershey on down

that Communism as a subject ‘even for discussion
is taboo.

A couple of years ago there was a lot of talk  I

about the pros and cons of Communism, but even,‘
then itwas only academic. Possibly the only con; I
crete tie-in with anything slightly tinged with the‘
commies was the Students for Wallace movement.
Since that time Wallace has thrown up his hands
despair and is now‘ attacking the communists.
Martin went on to say that the "‘real meaning
of America can only be understood by a thorough,-

‘ study of our history.” But he would have those his-

tory texts rigged so that no~one would evensuspect
that we were sometimes not all George Washington
wanted us to be.’ He wants us to get our facts out

Pennsylvania. He was resting_ on his laurels and
was at the time also engaged in a verbal free-for-all
with ‘Rep. Hiram G. Andrews of Johnstown. Sort
of saving his yjtriol for a more immediate and dan-‘,
gerous opponent. 

The Legionnaires, of course, are not the only C

groups which feel that Americanism is their own
particular province. But they“ are indeed the moﬂsutp.
vocal of all the various and _sundry pgatriotsi.
Almost any group which may be tabbed with ‘ap-3

‘out for the Constitution. ‘ _ ' 
And‘whe_n one of these organizations gets_ its fur
up, it heads straight for a college or university,
especially. those that receive state aid. They know.
that they can gain at least a token victory. Penn
State, probably one of the most conservative of all
the largeschools, was -forced to initiate an investi-
gationof its own. This was a token victory.

Pitt a "Hotbed" -

. Pitt has frequently been suspect to the patriots,
despite the fact that Pitt contributes more true blue
Rotarians and Lions than any other school "in
the state. Our Bus Ad School turns out the free
enterprisers by the thousands. Few if any of them
have ever deviated from conventional social and
economic philosophies. ‘

But the real danger in all of this campaigning
against un-Americanism lies in the possibilities of it
being extended\to mere political and personal con.
The number of communists on the
loose in the State is inﬁnitesimal and yet from the

amount of space devoted to it in the papers and v

the enormous amount energy spent in combating it,
one would think that they were ready to seize power.
They are not. They had their real opportunity

By DON MURDOCK
Sports Editor

Co—Chairman of the NCAA Television Committee Cap-
tain Tom Hamilton deserves a pat on the back for what he

did last summer.

Hamilton was boss man of the TV setup until the added
duties of head football coach forced him to need help.

Ralph Furey of Columbia was elected co-chairman to
help Hamilton draft the televising of ball games this fall so

that each district might see gamcs¢

and also that the Television Com-

the Notre Dame-Indiana contest

mittee might Study the eﬁect 0f at South Bend. The three were

television on attendance.

Now, I don’t believe Hamilton
was forced intd televising any of
Pitt’s games. After all, he is still
Athletic Director, and, as such,
is interested in drawing specta-
tors to Pitt’s home games.

But there is no record of Ham

ilton voicing disapproval of the?

Pitt-Duke game being televised.

He knew that local televisingi

would harm the game’s attend-
ance, but he had faith in the work
of the Television Committee and
its ticklish problem of television
and attendance. ‘

And certainly television hin-
dered Saturday’s attendance. With
two evenly matched major gridiron
powers playing in perfect football
weather the crowd should have
numbered around the 40,000 mark,
but the actual count was 20,066.

Pitt Football Gained Friends
But did the university suffer
from the experiment? From a few
queries that I made the fans who
watched from their homes were
very well pleased with Pitt’s show-
ing. Fans, today, want to see wide-
open football with plenty of offen-
sive punch. And certainly Satur-
='day’s game was not lacking in any-
thing but sound defensive play.

“I was very disappointed in
Saturday’s crowd,” says Hamil-
ton, but he can be sure that the
university and Pitt football
gained many friends over the
weekend. '

It’s too bad that Pitt couldn’t
have won the game for district
fans, but I, for one, was impressed
by the Panthers, especially with
their triple threat backﬁeld of Bob
Epps, Bill Reynolds, and Lou
Cimarolli. I know that I would far
rather remember this year’s Duke
game than last fall’s Michigan
State or Miami contests.

say that except
for the second
q u ar t e r the

may be attributed to the fact that
Irish Coach Frank Leahy used 56
men in the Hoosier defeat.

But when one remembers that it

made wholesale raids on western

talent, and that this talent is now
veteran material at Indiana, one
begins to wonder if maybe the
Irish caught Indiana on an ‘off’

Panther ‘All D

  

- ressed Up’ 

F or ’51 in Expensive Garb

By DON SCHURNIAN

Herk Duncan, pre -dent
junior who wears the Pan-
ther suit this year, wore a
brand—new suit of fur in the
Panther’s ﬁrst public appearance
of the ‘season last Saturday. Con-
trary to its appellation, however,
the new suit, exclusive of the
headpiece, is made of the pelts of
eight Utah mountain lions, each
worth about $60.

Along with the head, which is
the old headpiece just ’ repaired,
the suitweighs about 35 pounds——
a good weight to carry around all
afternoon.

James Kosinski, Carnegie mu-
seum taxidermist’ who put to-
gether the new panther suit in his
spare time, claims, “I used the
best pelts‘I could purchase.” His
most diﬁicult task in making "the
suit came in obtaining good pelts,

Medieval 0 Modern
  Masters In Art Display

A variety of paintings depicting some of the trends in
art dating _from the early Italian to the modern are now on
display at the 7th ﬂoor Art Gallery of the university.

Some of the artists whose paint-
ings are represented are: Michel-
angelo M. Caravaggio, Bartolme
E. Murillo, Gino Severini, Honore
Daumier, John Singleton Copley
and John James Audubon.

Each From An Era

Each painting represents an era
of art that reveals the painters
conception of life in that partic-
ular -period. Most of the paintings
show an interest in the treatment

'of lightand show a marked trend

toward a’ use of color to give the
painting_ a rich dark dramatic tone
or a light demure, inspiring one.

Caravaggio, a very early Italian ‘

painter uses the dramatic tones
blended’ withrich colors of fuchia
and gold to accentuate a deep
concern in the features of the
“Lute Players.” The ‘Spanish
painter, Murillo uses this same
ideain his painting of the “Pas-
try Eaters.”
. Cubist Art Included

A bit of cubism staring toward
the modern or the more or less
scientiﬁc element in art‘ is seen in.
Gino Severini’s “The Restless

I Dancer.” An Italian painter of the

19th ‘century, Severini, gives
movement to ﬁgures in his works.

Throughout a maze of beauti-
fully spotted triangles, the artist
has placed the dark eyes of a
dancer and swirling ﬁgures of a

' ballerina. As the critic looks at

this painting his eyes seem to fol-
low the moving feet of the dancer
and the entire picture comes to’
life. ' _ A -
The American painters, Copley
and Audubon, each use a different
approach in lighting to the crea-
tion of their painting.

This classy campus caper-cutter got his snootful of .

cute cigarette tests. It d_idn’t talce him long to dig out

the fact that cigarette mildness can’t be determined

by a mere single puﬁ or quick-sniff experiment!‘

Millions of smokers, on and off the campus, have discov-

ered there’s only one true test of cigarette Imildness.
ITS THE SENSIBLE TEST. ._.the 30-day
Camel Mildness Test, which simply asks you to

try Camels as your steady smoke - on a day-after-day

basis. No snap judgments. Once you’ve tried Camels
for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat,‘
T for Taste), you’ll see why . . .
