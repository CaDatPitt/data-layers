UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH VOLUME EIGHTY-SEVEN, ISSUE SEVEN

Pitt police and assailant exchange gunfire on Fos

Misguided gun fire from the shooting incident left a pedestria

library with a bullet hole.

By Julie Sabol

News Editor

Gun shots were exchanged
between a Pitt campus police
officer and a passenger of a ﬂeeing
car early Sunday morning outside
of Hillman library.

At 3 am Sunday, a university
officer heard gun shots coming
from Forbes Avenue near Hillman
Library, and approached the
scene, according to the campus
police report.

“It would appear to be that
there was an altercation between
two groups of males in which the
first shots were fired on Forbes
Avenue.” assistant director of
public safety,Gary Moses said.

of Hillman, a male approached
him and pointed to a car and told
him the occupants of a car had a
gun, Moses said.

When the officer approached
the vehicle, the car started to
pull away, and the officer yelled
for the car to stop, according to
the campus police report.

The right front passenger
opened the door and fired several
shots at the officer. The officer
then fired back and the vehicle
ﬂed the scene, Moses said.

“This is the first time in a
number of years that there’s
been an officer shot at,” Moses
said. ’ ‘

He said the officer was able to
get the plate number of the
vehicle and the owner of the

vehicle was identified.
Investigators went to his

house, Moses said, where the

owner then admitted to driving

the car at the time of the '

incident.

The owner then identiﬁed
Jim Borowski of Plum,
Pennsylvania as the man who
fired shots in the air, according
to Moses.

An investigator contacted
him and he turned himself in
and his weapon. He admitted
firing shots in the air while
on foot on Forbes Ave, Moses
said. A

Borowski was charged with
recklessly endangering another
person and firing a weapon
within city limits.

Moses said both Borowski
and the «driver of the vehicle
identified another man as the
person who was sitting in the
front passenger seat as the

person who fired shots at the I

officer.

“At this time, the investigation
is continueing and an arrest
warrant will be issued for the
[man] who fired shots at the
officer,” Moses said.

Moses said an altercation
seems to have caused the guns
to be ﬁred, but he said there is
no information that would
relate the shooting to gang
violence. No students or minors
were involved in the incident,
Moses said. . .

The city police took a shooting
report and the Plum police
assisted, campus police have
been handling the investigation.

Four-year Ola’ girl in serious
condition after transplants

By Heather Gahres

Asst. News Editor

Four-year old Laura Davies is in serious condition following a liver and small
intestine transplant at Children’s Hospital on Wednesday, hospital spokesperson
Toby Trosky said.

Davies was ﬂown in from England to receive the transplant since a liver and
small intestine transplant - had never been performed in England, Trosky
said.

“Laura is the eleventh patient to receive this operation at Children’s Hospital in
Pittsburgh,” T rosky said, “Children’s is known internationally as a transplant center.”

This was not the first operation Davies has gone through. When she was born, her
small intestine was outside of her body. This was corrected by surgical intervention,
Trosky said. .

Due to her birth defect, Davies had short-gut syndrome which is why she needed

I the transplant.
Short—gut syndrome causeswpatients to not have enough of their small intestines,
so they are unable to absorb or digest food; T rosky said. i

In order to pay for the operation and ﬂight to Pittsburgh, a fund raising drive was
organized. .

Saudi Arabia King Fahd donated 275,000 dollars to help send Davies to Children’s,
Trosky said. While 'over 640,000 dollars was raised for Davies in Britain for her
operation, according to the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette News Fax.

Davies continues to recover in Children’s Hospital. “She seems to be doing well,"

Trosky said.

Free depression clinic
available for students

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

People with recurrent depression can
beat the high cost health care by
attending the free treatment program
offered by Pitt's Depression Prevention
Clinic.

Senior research program coordinator,
Sandra O’Donnell said the program
will treat patients who suffer from
recurrent depression with
“interpersonal psychotherapy [that
is] short term landl was
developed especically for depressed
patients.”

The psychotherapy focuses on
relationships and issues that contribute
to the patient’s depression.

O’Donnell said the therapy also
focuses on educating family mem-
bers on the patient’s condition
and ways to help prevent recur-

rance.

Anti depressnt medications are
administred to the patient if it is
clinically indicated that the patient is
not making satisfactory progress,
O’Donnell said. ‘

The sympotoms of recurrent
depression include feelings of
adness, irritability, changes in sleep
and appetite, loss of interest in daily
activites, low energy,trouble
concentrating and thoughts of suicide.

To be classified as recurrent
depression, O’Donnell said the
sympotoms must be persistent over a
span of at least two weeks.

In addition to treatment, O'Donnell
said the clinic will be doing follow up
work with patients to see how stressor
life events contribute to bouts of
depression and how to overcome
them.

depression clinic call 624-1000.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday,’June 17, 1992

 

By Carmen M. McGill
For The Pitt News

Financially supporting all
aspects of the University of
Pittsburgh, members of the
business community can
contribute to Pitt through the Pitt
Ambassadors program.

Comprised of small- to medium-
sized corporations in the
Pittsburgh area which give
financial support to various
schools, organizations and clubs
at Pitt, the Ambassadors
organization is a part of the
development department of the
university.

With 127 members, the Pitt
Ambassadors is an umbrella
organization made up of
graduates of a number of different
colleges and universities. Eighty-
two of the members are not Pitt
alumni.

“The Pitt Ambassadors allows
us to become more familiar with
the university,” director of the
Ambassadors John Novey said.
“It gives the business community

the opportunity to support the
entire university.”

Though active in many aspects
of the university, the club does
have one main goal, according
the chair of the Ambassadors, Ed
Siegal. “[Our] primary focus is to
raise money for scholarships,” he
said.

In addition to fundraising, the
Ambassadors also has grants and
programs that help the university
at large.

The organization is entirely
donor driven. “We designate
where we’d like our contributions
to go,” Siegal said. .

Though the Pitt Ambassadors
mainly contributes financially,
members seek to learn more
about the university as well.

“We seek to become more
familiar with what Pitt is doing
that is not highly publicized,”
Siegal said. “We tend to take

‘things for granted living here in

the city.” .

Novey said the group wants to
“know” the university better.
“We’re looking to establish good

relations between the student
body and our organization,” he
said.

He said the group has taken
tours of many Pitt facilities to
become more familiar with the
campus.

At its first annual scholarship
fundraising dinner this April, the
Pitt Ambassadors awarded two
full scholarships to high-school
seniors who will attend Pitt this
fall.

“Our members are very
involved in their community,"
assistant director of the Pitt
AmbassadorsAngelaTimashenka
said. '

In addition to awarding two
full scholarships this year, the Pitt
Ambassadors has donated funds
to the rowing club, the band and
numerous schools and colleges
within the university.

The organization provided the
funds needed for the installation
of the new sound system recently
in the Stephen Foster Memorial,
the laser printer in the law school
and the new circuit of weights in

Pitt Ambassadors allow commai/my to contribute

Trees Hall.

“Every year we take on about
four special projects,” T imashenka
said. “The board of directors
decides what four projects we go
aﬁen”

Many of the businesses that
make up the Pitt Ambassadors
offer internship programs and
resources to the university.

“Our members aren’t in it for
the name recognition,” Novey
said.

The long-term plan of the
Ambassadors is for its financial
contribution to the university to
grow as the involved businesses
grow, he said.

Novey said that perhaps in the
future the organization will have
scholarships in the names of
respective member companies.

“What’s good for Pitt is good
for the city of Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania,” he said.

Founded in December 1985,
the Pitt Ambassadors was
designed to be a major outreach
effort to local and national
businesses.

Pittengineers take eighth in national race car competition

Edward Goldhahn
For T be Pitt News

Despite only one week of actual
race testing, Pitt’s design team’s
autocross race car placed eighth
out of S4 nationwide schools'at

the annual design competition‘

organized by the Society of
Automotive Engineers.

The design team is composed
of mechanical engineers and
serves as their required senior
year engineering project.T h i s
year’s group of ten ME’s worked
strenuously throughout the entire
year to design and build an
autocross race car, head project
engineer Bill Maroun said.

“If we would have eliminated
one person from the team it
wouldn’t have worked. We
worked so well together because
each of us have different
experience in engineering,”
Maroun said.

The teams’ race cars were
judged in events such as design
presentation, cost analysis, skid
pad, acceleration,

maneuverability, braking, and
endurance.

“We were really happy with
our fourth place finish in
maneuverability because speed
and maneuverability are really
what this type of car is built for.
Our car and one other were the
only two in the top ﬁfteen without
turbo, so that made us feel even
better,” Maroun said.

Pitt’s team also earned an eighth
place finish in acceleration, tenth
in endurance, and eleventh in
their design presentation.

However, Maroun said the team
did not do so well in the cost
analysis area of the competition.

“Our cost analysis really hurt
us, it was terrible. This is why
we’d like support from other
facets of engineering. Some
people from industrial
engineering could have really
helped us with our cost analysis,
and electrical engineering with
our fuel injection. Ifm hoping the
more visible our project
becomes, the more they’ll want
to get involved,” Maroun‘ said.

The design project is gaining

popularity and respect, Maroun I

said. Last year’s team had only
five people, and placed 24th.
To help with recruitment,
General Motors is working on a
program to attract students directly
from the SAE project for
automotive engineering positions. _
“Ifthe design project gets more
popular it may become selective,

‘ but right now it keeps students

away because ofthe tremendous
commitment,” Maroun said.

According to Maroun, he spent
between 50 and 40 hours per
week on the project.

He was head of this year’s
project because of his voluntary
involvement with last year’s team.
“My experience from last year
really helped. I learned a lot
about people management
being head of this year’s team,”

he said.

The team had a budget of
approximately 7,000 dollars with
which to work. They were given
money from General Motors,
General Electric, Pitt's mechanical
engineering department, Pitt’s
engineering department, and
many other small companies.

According to Maroun, other
schools, such as first place finisher
Cornell, had more than triple the
amount of money to work with

because of their involvment with _

SAE.

“Pitt’s machine shop helped us
out a lot. We couldn’t have done
it without them. Even other
students and staff members
helped tremendously; they were
all great,” Maroun said.

because the car is experienced.

Schools with experienced
second and third year cars, such
Cornell, University of

consistently placed in the top ten

FBI releases documents to student

By Pete Kapustynski
For The Pitt News C

After six years, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation has put
in writing its promise to release
documents to Pitt doctoral student
Eric Davin

The documents were requested
over six years ago in a Freedom
of Information Act request. They
concern the Workers Alliance,
established by the Socialist Party
of America and the Communist
Party of America in 1935 to assist
the unemployed.

Information from FBI
informants who attended Workers
Alliance meetings as well as
telephone wiretaps and
intercepted mail are included in
the documents.

During research for‘ his

dissertation, Davin discovered
there was little or no information
available on the Workers Alliance.
It was a major organization of the
unemployed during the 1930s
but discarded its records when it
disbanded in 1950.

Davin contacted the FBI on the
chance they may have engaged
in surveillance of the left-wing

"group. He filed a Freedom of

Information Act request in 1986.
“I didn't know,” he said. “Maybe
they had nothing.”

But Davin was surprised when
he discovered the FBI had 41
volumes containing over 10,000
documents on the Workers
Alliance and its leader, David
Lasser.

However Davin said they
would not release them to him
for national security reasons.

In April of this year Davin sued
the FBI in a U.S. District Court,
with the help of the American
Civil Liberties Union. A lawyer
for the FBI then told Davin in
June that the FBI had decided on
an out-of—court agreement and
would issue it to him in writing.

According to Davin, the letter

from the FBI states he will get

three of the 41 volumes by the
end of the month and the rest
over the next 13 months.

Attorney Maxine Kisilinski, who
works on cases for the ACLU,
attended the meeting with an
attorney for the FBI, Davin said.

He said Kisilinski requested
the lawsuit be put on temporary
suspension for 13 months. It will
not be reactivated as long as the
FBI complies with the terms of its
agreement:

Pitt receives money
to improve sciences

By Heather Gahres

Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh has received a $1.7 million,
five-year grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

The grant is to be used to encourage undergraduate
students to pursue careers in science, biological sciences
Chair David Burgess said.

“This whole funding is targeted to keep undergraduates in
professions of science research as opposed to going to
medical school,” Burgess said.

Over 180 schools applied for the grant. Pitt received the
second largest grant, surpassing Ivy League schools such as
Harvard University.

“It’s important that IHHMII does not give out money easily.
This is a prestigious award recognizing the quality of Pitt’s
faculty and students,” Burgess said.

The proposal is broken into four separate initiatives:
student research, faculty development, Curriculum and
laboratory development and pre—college and outreach
programs, Burgess said.

Pitt’s planning for student research will include campus
symposia for research, summer Iu nches and seminar programs

for students, he said. ‘

OSU’s budget problems could
be over if coins found buried on
the campus prove to be authentic
from the 15th century. Several
dozen gold coins were discovered
Monday afternoon by an OSU
student.

James Lira, executive director
of the Columbus—based Coins
Galore, said he has only made
preliminary study of the coins,
but that they could be worth
more than $1 million each.

“Typically gold coins, even
older coins such as these, are not
worth much,” Lira said.

“However these coins
appear to be a rare mint of
Spanish coins, possibly from
Seville.” _

He said it will take several days
to test the coins to authenticate
them.

Grant

Continued from page 4

The science departments will
also usethegrant to provide paid
opportunities for outstanding
undergraduate students to do
research during the school year
and inthe summer, Burgess said.

The fellowships will target
sophomore and junior students.

“Our faculty development plan
includes providing time for
research faculty members to
develop exciting and new
courses,” Burgess said.

Courses the faculty are already
working on include an organic
chemistry lab and lecture
designed for the biological
sciences, expansion of the
neurophysiology lab course and
a separate first—year, honors~like
lab course to accompany the
introductory biology lecture,
Burgess said.

“We are also developing a
scientific writing course. Scientific
writing is different fromiwriting
English papers. It requires a
certain style and presentation,”
Burgess said.

There will also be a seminar
course run by undergraduates
which will invite prestigious

scientists on campus to lecture, .

according to Burgess.
The third part of the proposal,
curriculum and laboratory

development, will give major
funding to provide. better
equipment for labs, he said.

The grant will also be used to
develop a cell biology lab course,
a developmental biology lab, a
computer teaching lab and a
neurophysiology lab, Burgess
said.

The pre-college and outreach
programs will be integrated with
already existing programs such
as Investing Now, a program for
outstanding minority junior high
and high school students in the
Pittsburgh Public Schools.

“\X/e’ll try to hire science
students to be tutors in the
Investing Now program, ” Burgess
said. “lThe outreach program] is

targeted to the under—re presented ..,

minority students. We’ll try to do
our part to address this problem.”

The grant will also be used to
run hands-on lab and field
workshops for high school
teachers.

“Our feeling is if you teach the
teacher what’s exciting and new
in science, the teacher will be a
better teacher,” Burgess said.

The proposal will also
identify outstanding students and
faculty from historically black
colleges and universities and
offer them summer fellowships
at Pitt.

Clinton wants his MTV  

Popular media continues to become more and more 

important in politics, and public perception is critical for
political success. '  ~ ,
Last night on MTV, Bill Clinton, possibly the next
President of the United States, addressed an important
segment of America: young women and men. Clinton is

apparently aware that the future of American youth is a '

real issue for the 1992 presidential race. Opportunity will
not knock on the door for the present high school and
college generation.

Reaching out to America, Clinton has proved that he is
the accessible candidate and is willing to listen. On the
Arsenio Hall show, Clinton demonstrated his musical
talent on the saxophone. Clinton has breached traditional
politics over the last few weeks and garnered renewed
respect. Although it may seem silly that presidential
candidates appear on popular television shows, it was
only 22 years ago that then-President Richard Nixon
appeared on Rowan and Martin’s “Laugh-In.”

Compared to his likely serious challenger, George

‘Herbert Bush, Bill Clinton wins admiration for capturing

young America’s attention and wanting to address its
concerns.

Bush claimed the country was not in a recessionwhile
unemployment skyrocketed over a year ago. Bush
continues to send Quayle on a mission to alienate voters.
On Monday, Quayle had a photo opportunity with New
York Cardinal John O’Connor, a man who opposes
contraceptives and supports anti-abortion terrorists like
Operation Rescue. ’ .

For some reason, the Bush administration has pushed
Quayle beyond ridiculous and into the realm of fantastic
entertainment. Blaming fictional television characters and
30-year-old inactive social programs for social and

’economic._problems caused by recent Republican,

administrations qualifies as passing the buck.

Bush also has his back to the gender gap closing on his
political career. In Pennsylvania and other states, women
vote more than men and consistently have their issues
ignored by the Bush administration.

Women want good social programs — Bush cuts and
slashes while sending money abroad. Money is there for
the savings-and-loan scandals and for Bush’s military
whims. 8

Women want pro-choice candidates — Bush still vows
to overturn Roe v. Wade with his Supreme Court.

Arsenio Hall put it best in yesterday’s USA Today saying,
“Excuse me, George Herbert, irregular heart-beating,
read-my-lying-lipping, slipping in the polls, do nothing,
deficit raising, make less money than Millie the White
House dog last year, Quayle—loving, sushi-puking Bush.
I don’t remember inviting your ass to my show. I don’t
need you on my show. My ratings are higher than yours.”
Clinton is far more interesting than Bush-. Maybe next
week it would be nice to see him on “Oprah.”

Gene discrimination in the future

Applying for health—care insurance coverage may
not be as easy as you think. People who have no
apparent illness could be discriminated against
based on genetic information obtained from blood
drawn from a finger prick. This potential for
discrimination has been acknowledged by scientists
involved in the Human Genome Initiative (HGI), a
federally funded project which is researching genes
and their link to DNA, human

standard rates when they represent more than
standard risk.” '

A lawyer in Steubenville, Ohio, Theresa Morelli,
was denied disability insurance because her
insurance company found out through her doctor’s
mistake that her father has Huntington’s disease.
Morelli has a S0-percent chance of developing the
disease since‘ it is caused by an inherited defective

gene.

Jon Beckwith, a'Harvard
professor studying molecular

Future legislation will be
needed to determine if insurance
companies have the right to deny
coverage to someone based on
the possibility that he or she may

collection each of us carries where

almost all human genes reside. These chromosomes
contain the genes contributing to many of our traits
...” Mutations of human genes can result in disease
or in the susceptibility to disease.

Currently, prenatal genetic testing gives parents-
to—be information about the possibility that their
childwill be born with a birth defect. This is fair to
those parents who can afford the tests. However

poor prospective parents usually cannot afford

prenatal testing. As a result, a larger number of
children with disabilities are born to parents who
cannot afford to care for them.

Genetic testing is also used to tell people of their
susceptibility to hereditary diseases such as
Huntington’s disease.

This medical information is confidential, but in
the future employers may require potential
employees to provide prior genetic testing or to
undergo tests before being hired. Few employers
request genetic information when they hire
employees because the tests can cost from $2,000
to $3,000 each.

However as the price of testing drops, employers
will be more motivated to use the tests as they did
when drug, polygraph and general medical testing
became more affordable. Cost is now the only
restraint. This is one reason why Pennsylvanians
should begin to develop laws which protect citizens
against genetic discrimination by employers.

The American Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
could protect some employees who are carriers of
genetic disease, but it has ‘not yet been proven in
court. A person with a disability covered by the
ADA is described as one who ‘.‘is perceived to be
disabled, even if there is no actual incapacity.”

ADA would not protect people from health-
insurance discrimination. Jude Payne, a Health
Insurance Association of America public relations
director, stated that insurance companies “don’t

develop a disease sometime in
the future. Scientists may be close toidentifying a
gene for alcoholism, a disease which is also
inﬂuenced by environmental factors such as stress
and family dynamics.

However after a genetic test is developed, insurers
could refuse to cover people based on their fear
that applicants could develop alcoholism someday
or that their dependents could develop it. People
could be refused coverage because of predeterrni ned
genetic characteristics over which they have no
control.

One of the major difficulties in basing employment
and insurability decisions on genetic testing is that
testing is not always accurate or predictable, even
though it is perceived that way by the nonscientific
public. Dr. Paul Billings, vice chair ofthe Department
of Medicine at the Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco, found that one out of every two couples
from the general public who are identified as “at
risk” for being carriers of cystic fibrosis are
misdiagnosed. This diagnosis could have horrible
repercussions in the couples’ lives, such as in their
decision whether or not to have children.

Genetic testing becomes dangerous when it is
used by institutions to deny opportunities, benefits,
work or health care. The debate then becomes one
of whose rights supersede the other’s: people with
possible genetic defects or the insurance companies
to which they apply for policies. People with
disabilities, manifest or not, should not be shut out.

The HGI is the first scientific research project to
set aside three percent of its budget to address
ethical, legal and social implications of gene research.
This commitment to discussing the wide—ranging
effects of future genetic testing should be continued
in the state legal system and at colleges where
future scientists and policy—makers are trained.

Canadian lawredefines nature of sexual assault

It seems health care is not the
only area in which the United
States could use some Canadian
advice.

In a bold and necessary move
to help rape victims, the passing
of a proposed Canadian sexual

assault bill will mean that alleged _

rapists could be convicted solely
on the proof that the woman did
not consent to sex.

Aimed at easing the great
difﬁculty of convicting rapists,
the bill is being praised by
Canadian women’s groups as a
law which ﬁnally says that no
truly means no. _

' Opposition to the bill is coming

from conservative groups and’

attorneys which say the proposed
law is too strict and “out of touch
with reality," according to Bob
Wakeﬁeld of the Ontario Criminal
Lawyers Association.

But it is this opposition that is
out of touch with reality. It is
trying to create the illusion that
under the proposed law all
instances of sex could be called

. rape.

“It’s assumed consentuntil there

is an expression of ‘no.’ That’s

not the way anymore. All those
acts could become criminal unless
you get consent in advance,"
Wakeﬁeld said.

Opportunities for women and minorities ahouna’

But in saying there is assumed
consent until an expression of
“no,” Wakeﬁeld is mistaken. There
is only the chance of sex until an
expression of “yes” or “no.”

The attitude that a man can
assume a woman is going to have
sex with him, without her having
agreed to or shown any clear
signs of agreement, is sexist.

This attitude views women as
objects ready to be taken by men
for their sexual pleasure
whenever they choose.

The pervasiveness of this type
of sexist attitude throughout
society is one of the main reasons
rape is so widespread.

Such attitudes must be
combatted, and the proposed
Canadian law will do this. Our

great land of the free should

follow Canada’s lead.

The bil1’s main impact would
be on date rape, where consent
becomes the focal point of trials.
Accused date rapists typically
claim that they mistakenly
believed the woman agreed to
have sex with them. ,

The proposed law would limit
the ability of rape defendants to
claim mistakenly perceived
consent, especially in situations
in which the victim is too
intoxicated to give or withhold

consent, when another person
gives consent to have sex with
the victim or when a person in a
position of authority coerces
the victim into having
sex. .

This is how the new law could
change the sexist status quo.
Instead of rape being forced sex
against the victim’s will, it
becomes sex without the victim’s
consent.

Josh
  Obusek

S This is more precise,
considering the various situations
of rape, especially those just
listed.

Forcing sex on a woman who
is screaming “no” or forcing sex
on a woman who is unable to
express “no" both cause the same
extreme emotional and
psychological damage. Both of
these should be punished
equally, which the Canadian law
would do and American laws do
not. _

The courts’ allowing rape
defendants to walk away from

such charges as those listed

displays the sexism in society
that fosters rape. , _
Allowing a man to walk away

1 from a rape charge because the

victim was too intoxicated to say
“no” is sexist.

It implies that the woman
deserved what she got for being

’ so drunk, that women shouldn’t

do such things. But no matter
what a woman does, she
never deserves to be
raped. '
Allowing men to walk away
from rape charges because

someone else told them they ’

could have sex with the victim is
sexist because it implies that
women are so unimportant that
someone else can make their
most personal decisions .for
them.

These rapists need to be shown
how wonderful it is to have their
decisions made for them — ,a
prison will do just fine.

It is especially astounding that
people in positions of authority
continue to coerce victims into
having sex. ,

Forcing someone to agree to
sex is identical to forcing them to
have sex, which is rape. Finally
there is a law that would view
both in identical light.

The bill also limits the use of

the victim’s sexual history in trials
due to the risk that it “may unduly
arouse sentiments of prejudice,
sympathy or hostility in the jury.”
The judge would weigh the
history’s relevance to the trial
and provide a written account
of the ruling to use it or not.

Defense attorneys usually try
to portray rape victims as whores,
which leads to many rapists’
acquittals and many rape victims’
failure to seek their deserved
justice.

Under the proposed law there
would be an end to this preying
on the jury’s prejudices toward
sexually active women.

In Canada there is a social and
political movement to help rape
victims.

The proposed law will not only

make it easier to convict rapists,_
it will attack the real problem: the
sexism that leads to the brutalizing
of women.

But in the United States, where
one out of four college women
are raped, it is not even an issue
in this year’s presidential race.
We have no proposed law, none
of the typicalfalse promises, not
even an expected veto.

josh Obusek is a junior
majoring in political science.

‘Now and again, forever and always,
constantly and incessantly, we hear women
and minorities going on ad nauseam about
the so—called “glass ceiling” that exists for
them in America today.

Of course those above this ceiling are
generally characterized as white, Anglo-
Saxon, Protestant and, of course, male
(surprise, surprise). The argument (or
should I say whining) claims that there is
some sort of conspiracy, or at least an
understood, unstated agreement, among
this group.

This “conspiracy” supposedly states that
this group will not allow those in the
aforementioned categories to advance to
the upper echelons (let alone the top) of
America’s corporations, all the way down
to the corner drug store.

Of course all this ignores the front page
of USA Today on June 12, which included
a report that the percentage of women
holding corporate positions in America is
at a record high. It also ignores a report in
the same paper several weeks ago that
capital investment in new black businesses
last year outpaced that of any other ethnic
group, including the W.A.S.P.s!

Yet in class after class, lecture after
lecture, textbook after textbook, we are
subjected to this bent and twisted view

that minorities are (can you believe this?) .

intentionallybeing held down by a white-
male-dominated society. This is altogether
asinine, to say the least.

Let us become a bit simplistic. If [start
a company and in my company we
manufacture (you guessed it) widgets, I'm
going to hire 10 people to make mywidgets.
Five of those people are going to be black,
and five of those people are going to be
women. Now I'm going to run mycompany
until my days are numbered. In that time,
I assure you that no one is going to be
promoted to president of my company

because I'M THE PRESIDENT!

Does this make me a racist? NO — Fifty
percent of my employees are black! Does
this make me a male chauvinist pig? NO—
Fifty percent of my employees are women!

The point here is that this is my company
and nobody is going to tell me I have to
give up control of my life’s work because
I have a “glass ceiling” in effect at my
business. —

Bill
Kendall

And by the way, if I happen to have any
sons that are interested in taking over the
family business, and I happen to be of the
disposition to give it to them, I will. That
is my prerogative, my right and, most
importantly, ‘MY BUSINESS!

Now people, I’m well aware that the
structure of corporate America is not that
simple.

66

However, allow me to rattle off a list of j

both minority and female success stories.
These include, but are certainly by no
means limited to: Pat Schroeder, Jesse
Jackson, Sandra Day O’Connor, Clarence
Thomas, Anita Hill, Colin Powe1l,_Geraldine
Ferraro, the late Alex Haley and, of course,
even our own Sophie Masloff.

I could literally go on and on. I have not
even touched upon the entertainment

' industry, where these groups dominatein

a big way.

Think about it —— how many people will
go see the new Batman movie because
they want to see Michelle Pfeiffer or any
movie with Julia Roberts? Eddie Murphy,
Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg
command salaries about which college
students can only dream. Again, the bottom
line is that these people didn’t seem to
encounter any “glass ceiling. ”Why?

The naive or jealous would say that they
are successful in W.A.S. P. America because
they conform to the stereotypes that
W.A.S.P.s attach to them

Sorry, that doesn’t wash. These are

people with enormous power in their
respected ﬁelds. They didn’t get there by
conforming. They got there on the strength
and power of their own achievements.
_This is not something which I have
decided to share with you, this is something
each and every one of them will tell you
themselves. You can ﬁnd them saying it in
interviews, on television and radio, in
magazines, through their publicists, etc.
They will tell you this if you will listen.
Now folks, none of this is to imply that
discrimination no longer exists in this
country. What I am simply saying is that
opportunities exist "today more than at any
time in our history: Never before have
minorities been so free; never before have
there been so many women so high up in
the work force
I do not aim to imply that enough is
enough. I’m simply acknowledging that
the gains to date bavebeen significant and,

The 1970s brought us a great thing: Alan Rev and Mark Vega’s
band Suicide, which offered hypnotizing mantras of sound unlike
anything heard ofsince The Seeds. The ’80s: enter the Spacemen 3,
obviously childhood fans of the aforementioned band. They
incorporated that into a harder boiled and lead—weighted pastiche;
then they broke up.. Their leader, Sonic Boom, suited up in a bell-
diver’s outfit and scoured the bottom—feeding, scu m-sucking themes
of human nature in his debut LP Spectrum. Meanwhile, the other
two, Jason Spaceman and Willie B. Carruthers, cranked out the
single “Anyway That You Want Me," a precursor to a full-length
record, under the name Spiritualized.

For starters, this was long awaited—- we're talkin’ almost two years
since they released that first single. It was the summer of ’90, when
consumer confidence was hard and strong and talk of bear markets
was just a whisper; the same summer Greg Lelviond took the high-
gear, hard-crank attitude to stomp Frenchie Fingon in the French
Alps’ altitude during the ﬁnal stagesiof the Tour. Finally, with very
bated breath, almost to the level of technicolor facial capillaries, it’s
here.

The title: Lazer Guided Melodies. What we have here is an offering
somewhatsimilar to a symphonic undertaking with all the trimmings:
dulcimers, cellos, violins, flutes, pianos, autoharps, plus the standard
Fender Telecaster and Gibson accoutrements. This provides an
eclectic and multilayered lactose Calliope of digital encodings that
attempt a 40-minute—plus epic loosely divided into? four thematic
segments. '

Men's swirn team bols

By Jim Lakely ,
Sports Editor

This upcoming season may
prove the toughest yet for Pitt’s
men’s swimming and diving
team.

The Big East is a quickly
improving conference, and head
coach Chuck Knoles will have to
fill the holes left" by seven
graduating scorers if Pitt is to win
its 11th straight championship.
Knoles is off to a good start after
recruiting perhaps the strongest
and deepest class of swimmers in
Pitt’s history.

“With this recruiting class plus
the possible foreign athlete or
two that we are trying to bring in
to the team, we are looking really
good,” Knoles said.

“We have a lot of holes to fill,
so we are going to be suspect in
a lot of areas. It is going to come
down to how quickly we can
develop raw talent and fill the
gaps-” ’

Those gaps» are named Joe
Kozlina, Cubby Mattson,
Eric Cornell, {Fred Costantini,
David Schepner, Phil Cruz

. and Eric Daum — men who

comprised the backbone of

last year's championship
team.
Along with standout

underclassmen like Matt Brady,
Don Boyd, Kevin McLaughlin and
Sean Braud, Knoles has brought
in some fresh faces to take up the
slack.

High school All—Americans
Aaron Fortner and Eric Stull top
this year’s outstanding recruiting
class. ,Fortner, from Armwood
High School in Seffner, Fla., will
try to step in for Cornell in the

100-yard butterfly.

Stull, also from the swimming
hotbed of Florida, will try to rm
the gap left by freestyle sprinter
Kozlina.

Fortner and Stull were ‘heavily
recruited by schools in Florida as
well as other national swimming
powerhouses, and Knoles feels
fortunate to have them swim for
Pitt.

“I think that says a lot for
where [the Pitt swim team] is
projected to be in the next few
years,” Knoles said.

“You never get everyone you
want, but I was pleased that we
lost some of our recruits to
institutions like Florida, Texas

and Auburn. We lost kids to"

schools that are ranked above
us.”

One ingredient that the top
swimming schools have and that
Pitt has lacked is the addition of
foreign athletes. This year that
may change. '

Knoles is currently recruiting a
swimmer on Finland’s national
team who has just finished
two years of military service as
well as a swimmer from
Canada.

“Either one of these kids will

be the topping on the cake',”V

Knoles said.‘ “They will have an
immediate impact on the
team.

‘‘It adds a nice ﬂavor to the
team to have a swimmer from
outside the U.S. It gives the
[American] swimmers a new
perspective.”

Back in the United States, Pete
Gage from Yardley, Pa., is a
strong breaststroke swimmer
and will try to solidify that
event behind Boyd and

McLaughlin.

“He has a lot of raw talent,”
Knoles said. “I want to make sure
we have some solid swimmers in
the breaststroke since we are
losing Boyd and McLaughlin next
year. Pete Gage is going to come
in and try to fill a very large hole
left by Mattson.”

The versatile Bob Kupperman
from Germantown Academy in
Wynnewood, Pa., is a strong all-
around ‘swimmer and will
compete in the individual
medley events as well as the
middle distance freestyle
events. , A

Knoles will try to further
develop the raw talent of David
Murphy from McLean, Va., to

bolster Pitt’s distance swimming
events. He is expected to develop
in other areas but is targeted to be
primarily a distance swimmer for
now. .
“I am real excited about Chris,”
Knoles» said of Chris Perry of
Conestoga, Pa.

“He has a _ lot of raw talent

and he‘ is very bright. We

had been recruiting him since
his junior_ year, and he. is a

‘very versartile -and -big"ki,d. He

doesn't have“ to fill any events
really, but I’ "got him for his
talent.” J l '

Steve Salvi and Steve Stout are
two more _ swimmers Knoles
describes as possessing‘ raw,
untapped talent. Salvi is a sprint

freestyler and Stout swims

middle—distance events.
Diving coach Julian Knig will-
bolster a deep diving squad with

Jeremy McLean from Butler Area . J

High School . , .
There will be a familiar name
on Pitt’s swim team this year. Pitt

out swimmer from Seneca Valley
High School in Mars, Pa. Sunseri
will have the difficult task of
replacing Boyd in the breast

years.

can’t, but we are going to give it
a try.”

Chicago proved ‘unbeata—Bull’ to Blazers

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer

The Chicago Bulls weren’t as talented as
the Portland Trail Blazers, but how many

times do we hear that it takes more than M

just talent to win titles?
The Bulls repeated as‘NB‘A champs by
winning all the small battles, even the

‘ ones they weren’t supposed to. The Blazers

may now have to accept the labels of
“chokers” and “underachievers” whether
they are accurate or not. This series eerily
evolved into the twilight zone for Portland,
with ugly stereotypes about the talented-
but-titleless club resurfacing.

Chicago won because they stifled
Portland’s breathtaking fastbreak to a slow
crawl. Racehorses Jerome Ke rsey and Clyde
Drexler were stuck in neutral for most of
the series, while the Bulls’ half-court
defense frustrated the impatient Blazers.

Only in games four and six did the
Blazers’ break do severe damage. The
Bulls played tremendous defense, and
fatigue may have also played a role.
Chicago’s bench was a deciding force
while the Blazers’ bench members served
largely as spectators thanks to head coach
Rick Adelman.

The two biggest edges Portland had
upon entering this series were point guard
Terry Porter and center/forward Cliff
Robinson. Porter didn’t even look like the
same player who destroyed Phoenix and

Utah, appearing very tentative. His deadly ,

looking for it.

jumper fellsilentearly and then he stopped
Inconceivably, the Bulls’
point guard tandem of B.J. Armstrong and
John Paxon dished out 50 assists to Porter’s

28. Certainly this will revive speculation.

that Porter possesses a “score first, pass
second” mentality. Many don’t consider
him a true lead guard and feel that Portland
needed just that to reach its potential.
Robinson should have seen more
minutes in the early stages of games. He
and Kersey seem to be the truestbarometer
of a Blazer performance. When they’re

-rejecting shots, sweeping the glass and

finishing with thunder dunks, Portland is
deadly. But that was rare in these six
games, and Chicago deserves all the credit
for that.

Robinson’s inspirational performance
was the deciding factor in Portland’s game-
"four victory, and he could have swayed
momentum to Portland completely by
getting off early in the next game. But
Portland fellbehind quickly, andthe Bulls
pounced and grabbed total control. Bulls’
head coach Phil Jackson adjusted well to
Adelman’s sleeker lineup and rendered
that strategy ineffective. '

The frontcourt turned out to be a big
edge for the‘ Bulls. Scottie Pippen finally
played consistently and outplayed Kersey
in all the key phases. The fierce Kersey
came alive in the ﬁnal three games of the
series, but with the exception of game
two Pippen ran wild. He averaged close
to 21 points per ‘game, while wreaking

havoc defensively. i

The unsung soldier of the Bulls, Horace
Grant, relegated a battle—tough—veteran-
like Buck Williams to a non—factor. Williams
and Kevin Duckworth found themselves
on the bench in too many key stretches.
The stats from game six give a true
indication: Williams, seven points (on 1-4
from the floor), and ‘Duckworth, four
points (2-3 ﬁeld goals). ' ’ ‘ 1 .

It also didn’t hurt that the Blazers forgot

‘S how to handle the basketball. Portland’

turned it over 21, 20, 18 and 21 times
respectively in its four losses, with Chicago
taking full advantage. The ‘most telling
pointof "all came in game five. After the
Blazers scrapped and clawed to an

emotional win in game four, you expected ,

them to bolt out and run in front of a
raucous crowd in game five. Instead the
Bulls built a 3926 lead, thanks to 17 points
from turnovers, and really took away all
the. heart Portland had left. Chicago’s
greatest.-strength as a champion is taking
advantage of mistakes and exploiting
whatever weakness they can find, however
small it might be.

But the sum of this equation still wouldn’t
have added to a 4-2 series victory if not for
Michael Jordan. Without him, the Bulls are
a below—average club at best. Jordan willed
his teammates to win this series. Pippen
ﬂashes and Grant toils, but beyond that
role-players are what comprise this team.
With Jordan as the foundation, the Bulls

Obscure awardsfor the truly a’eserz/z"ng

The National Hockey League’s
boss-is gone, but the Boss ofthe
Yankees is back. Da Bulls are
back on top of the NBA and the
Buccos just keep on battling their
way to the top of the National
League East. This past week in
sports was eventful enough to
give it an awards section you say?
Ask and ye shall receive.

The Buying the Smoke
Detector after the House Starts
Burning Down Award goes to
the NHL for finally pushing out
league Presidentjohn Ziegler last
week. Ziegler has been running
the league into the ground for
much ofhis tenure. The league is
a mess right now. The best player
in the world, Mario Lemieux, said
it best when he called the NHL a
“garage league.”

The list of problems Ziegler
helped bring about is long and
ridiculous. Vicious stick work is
taking out many NHL stars, most
notably Mario Lemieux and Ray
Bourque in this season’s playoffs.
Of course Ziegler probably
wouldn’t know much about this
since he routinely takes vacations
abroad during the playoffs. He
did little to stop a players’ strike
late this season which nearly
wiped out the post-season, and
the current collective bargaining
agreement leaves the league ripe
for another strike. The worst part
is the lack of a network contract,
leaving the teams unable to keep
up with rising salaries. The biggest
cause of the strike is the owners’
lack of enough money to give the
players what they expect.

The league should probably
get a fresh start with someone in
from the outsideto replace Ziegler.
Maybe one of the television

executives who are on the list
could get a real network deal, or
maybe an National Basketball
Association executive could show
the NHL how a real sports league
is run.

The Lunch with Wesley
Posvar Award goes to Ziegler.

and Pitt should help because it

the money for perks for]. Dennis
O’Connor. -

The Take a Breath, Guys
Award went to the Penguins last
Thursday. The move that got the
most attention was the
presentation of the new Penguin
logo (translation: cheap‘, money-
making scam by management).
This wasn’t worthwhile for any
reason other than the money from
sales of new merchandise. The
best observation I've heard was
that the new logo looks like
something on» the side of a
building at Sea World. Let me add
my voice to those who would
prefer the muscular cartoon
penguin KDKA—TV uses.

The more important move on
Thursday was the Pens’
presentation of a plan for
changing the NHL rules. They

show itself as a
league of skilled athletes, not a
bunch of goons.

The injury to Lemieux during
the playoff game against the
Rangers proves the need to
discourage a possible “If you
can’t beat them, beat them up”
mentality. One possible stumbling
block is that the Pens could be
seen as serving their own self-
interest.

The Pens don’t have many
fighters and comprise a team that
plays it fairly clean, so these
measures would help the
Pittsburgh cause.

Something that was
unquestionably done for the self-
interest of the Penguins franchise
was a substantial raise in ticket
prices.

Maybe they thought nobody
would notice with all the other
things going on. Guess what,
guys — we noticed. For this the
Pens get the Caught with the
Hand in the Cookie Jar
Award.

The Yet Another Sequel
Award goes to major league
baseball. In this summer of
Batman Returns and Lethal
Weapon 3, not to mention
Scanners 11] coming out on video,
baseball commissioner Fay
Vincent seems about to present

to us George Steinbrennerlfx The
Boss Revenge. The release of
this one was delayed as Vincent
investigates new information
about Steinbrenner, but it still
looks like the Yankees’ owner
will be back in control soon. This
serves as another reminder of
what “banned for life,” which
Steinbrenner was, means in
sports: not much.

If you are going to bring him
back, at least end the ban on
“Shoeless”Joe Jackson so he can
get into the Hall of Fame where
he belongs.

The Putting up Instead of
Shutting Up Award. goes to the
Chicago Bulls.

They didn’t make it look easy,
but they were at their best when
they had to be on the way to their
second straight NBA title. The
New York

Knicks may have made them
look like the “beata-Bulls,” as
one newspaper headline put it,
but now they are the champs.
Great teams don’t win all the
time, but they always win when
they really need to.

As for the talkative Trailblazers,
they get the Just -Shut up
Because You Still Can’t Put Up
Award. They continued to
babble throughout the series and
to whine after it but did nothing
to change their image as a team
that will eventually blow it.

The You’ve Got to Beat the
Man to Be the Man Award goes
to the Pirates. With their two-
year stranglehold on the top spot
in the National League East
looking very shaky with their top
rival, the New York Mets, coming
to town, the Bucs showed that
they also know about winning
when they have to.

They took three of four from
the Mets then brought out the
brooms for a sweep this past

AD Jaynes
recovering

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

University of Pittsburgh
Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes, who underwent
successful heart surgery on
Thursday, May 28, is
recovering well from the
procedure. His doctors
have reported they are
pleased with his progress
and expect a full recovery.

Jaynes has been released
from Presbyterian
University Hospital and is
recuperating at home.

He felt discomfort in his
chest upon returning from
a Big East Conference
meeting in Ponte Vedra,
Fla., and diagnostic testing
determined that heart
surgery was required. He is
expected to resume his
normal duties as athletic
director by the fall.

can withstand their weaknesses.

Portland’s puzzling lapses
made this series a lot less exciting
than expected. lt’s unfortunate
that the Blazers showed only
brief glimpses of the club that
rampaged through the first three
rounds of the postseason and
ultimately didn’t fire out of the
blocks with a vengeance until
game six.

By then it was too late.

It’s so easy to look in the rear-
view mirror, but why didn’t
Adelman go to his bench more?
Mark Bryant, Alaa Abdelnaby
and possibly Robert Pack could
have given Portland some quality
minutes, especially against the
likes of Stacey King, Cliff
Levingston and Craig Hodges.
Portland looked very tired at.
times, and Adelman’s thin seven-
man rotation didn’t help
matters.

It would be ridiculous to
speculate on Chicago’s chances
to three—peat since they’re the
third consecutive champion to
repeat, and the other two (L.A.
and Detroit) failed to win a third
straight title.

Add in the Bulls’ fragile
chemistry off the court and it’s a
50-50 shot at this point.

Remember: Chicago really isn’t
a great team but a good one in a
mediocre era. A

The Bulls don’t compare
favorably with any of the Laker,
Celtic or ’76er clubs of the late
’70s and ’80s, much less to the
all-time giants like the ’67 Sixers,
’69 Lakers, the Bill Russell Celtics
or the Knick juggernauts of the
early ’70s. '

Nevertheless, any repeat is a
tremendous accomplishment,
and the Chicago Bulls’ place in
history will now endure. They
overcame obstacles off the court
and convincingly proved
everything they had to on the
floor, while Drexler and the
Blazers may have a lifetime of
answering to their critics.

THE PI’IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 17, 1992 ‘ 1 5

Awards-

Continued from page 12
weekend in New York. The
Pirates now stand five
games up on second—place
St. Louis and seven games
up on the Mets.

The difference was
defense. The Pirates’ glove
I work was outstanding,
while the Mets’ defense
continued to cost them
games.

Scoring the game-
winning run in the top of
the ninth after an error
would have been a perfect
end to the series for
Pittsburgh if not for what
happened next.

This gave the Bucs the
Season-Ending Swing
Award.

It was a simple groundout
to second by Barry_Bonds,
normally a disappointing-
but—you-live-with-it play
since they had a lead
which would hold
up.

But Bonds went down
after the swing and didn’t
get back up. A twinge in his
ribs before the game
became a knifing,
debilitating pain.

Bonds is listed day—to-
day, but that is misleading.
This could end his season.
Remember 1989, when-
Andy Van Slyke was coming
off a career year in which
he nearly took the league
MVP award?

He had a rib injury that
kept him out for about a
month but crippled him all
year

If Bonds misses the rest
of the season, the Bucs
/won’t win the division. Even
if he can play through the
injury but isn’t himself, the '
Bucs are in trouble.

This injury could turn out
to be the Event of the
Week in what was a very
busy week.

NHL Draft

they’ll almost certainly lose one.

After this draft is over, another
one begins. The annual NHL Entry
Draft takes place Saturday with
the Penguins selecting 19th
overall. Due to the lack of quality
North American players, don’t be
surprised to see the Pens take
another European, possibly a
Russian, with their first selection.

General Manager Craig Patrick
is one of the best in the business
on draft day. While with the
Rangers, he drafted players like
Brian Leetch, Mike Richter, John
Vanbiesbrouck, Tomas
Sandstrom, Darren Turcotte, Tony
Granato, Ulf Dahlen and Dave
Gagner. In his two drafts so far
with Pittsburgh, he’s taken current
star Jaromir Jagr and future star
Markus Naslund.

Patrick doesn't draft for any
particular needs; he drafts the
best players available. Since the
Pens are moderately strong at
every position, that philosophy
should help.

Here, by position, are some
players the Pens might select
with their ﬁrst choice:

Center

Libor Polasek (Czechoslovakia)
6 feet 2 inches, 189 pounds. Two
goals and two assists in 16 games.

Martin Straka (Czechoslovakia)

5-10, 178. Thirty-six games, 23 I

goals and 24 assists for 47 points.

Martin Reichel (Germany) 6-1,
183. Brother of Calgary’s Robert
Reichel. Fifteen goals and 16
assists for 31 points and eight
penalty minutes in 27 games.
Right Wing

Valeri Bure (Russia) 5-10, 155.
Brother of Vancouver star Pavel
Bure. Fifty—three games for
Spokane (a Canadian-league
junior team), 27 goals and 22
assists for 49 points and 78 penalty
minutes.

Brian Loney (Canada) 6-1, 195.
Had 21 goals and 34 assists for 55
points and 109 penalty minutes
in 37 games at Ohio State.

‘Sergei Krivokrasov (Russia) 5-
10, 174. Played 36 games for the
Red Army Team in Russia, with
10 goals, eight assists, 18 points
and 10 penalty minutes.

Left Wing

Dmitri Kvartalnov (Russia) 5-
10, 172. In 77 games for San
Diego (a minor-league team), he
accumulated 60 goals, 58 assists,
1 18 points and 16 penalty minutes.

Kevin Smyth (Canada) 6-3, 217.
Thirty goals, 55 assists, 85 points
and 114 penalty minutes in 71
games for Moose jaw (Canadian
junior).

Jason Bowen (Canada) 6-4, 210.
