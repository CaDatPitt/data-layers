Masters To Be Qffered
|,n,_R'e.c.i+'als Next Year

Sometime this summer, the College
Music Set of musical recordings will
arrive at the.University, where -they
will be used next year for a series
of recitals open to students and fac-
ulty.

Practically every classical and mod-
ern composition worthy of note or
representative of particular musical
tzrends is included in the collection.
Prepared by the Carnegie Corporation
of New ‘forlz, it will becc-me the per-
mn1'ieriti'pno'pe1't.y’of the Un'ive1'sity. '

“We plan to put the concerts on a -

weekly basis,” commented "Theodore
M. Finncy, lecturer in musical appre-

, ciation and director of the glee club".

(“They will ‘be held on the 23rd ﬂoor,

wliicli in the near future'is to be '

turned over to the musical department.-

“I will tell a bit of the history of the
composition and its importance, and
then it will be played. After the re-

_"citals are running smoothly, we will

"take regular polls to see which num-
bcrs the ‘students want played.” '
Because of the student interest in
the new musical appreciation classes
and organ recitals, it was decided by
.the administration to purchase the
set. Included with the recordings are
scores, reference works, and biblio-
graphical .sourccs.--_- .. 1.,’ .._; . _.  _
An idea of the size of the collection
may be gained-, from the fact that the
works of Johann Sebastian Bach, cat-
aloguedycover ﬁve pages of the ac-
companying pamphlet. Also listed are

Chopin’s complete pianoforte works,‘

the nine Beethoven symphonie_s, and
all of _,_Schubert’s well-.known,1ieder.
Modern writers are also represented;
Paul Hindemuth with a symphony,
,and George. Gershwin’s, “Rhapsody In
Blue.”

Coeds Can't Decide
PrOP¢r Skirt Lengths

Long, Short Of Argument

Leaves Readers

Uncertain Regarding Future "Longitudes As Coeds
Agree  Floor-Length Evening Gowns

By PAULA LEVINSON

Coeds could and did become quite
candid when they gave their opinions
about what should be the length of a
1ady’s skirt in answering a question-
naire for the News.

Most of the women felt that skirts
would. never grow any shorter than
they were willing to wear them, some
\\'i;l‘(: not willing to wear thenr ‘.-is
short as they felt was the limit of
shortness, and one woman is amenable
to wearing them shorter than the
limit and much shorter than she ever
feels they would possibly go. All this
for the sake of fashion.

No woman would wear her skirt
shorter than her knees, but these were
not in the minority. There were not
many who retain the old-fashioned
idea that a girl’s legs are her own
and not to be gazed upon by the un-
appreciative public. .

The majority were willing to strike
a happy medium of two to four inches
below the knees or 12 to 14 inches
from the ﬂoor, depending on the
length of the legs.

About twice as many women prefer
longer skirts but they won’t say why.
Those whose skirts will be short will
wear them that way because their
boy-friends approve. One girl will
wear hers as “short as the ‘Jungle
Princess’ sarong.” Just where did that
reach to?

NO! Emphatically and unanimous-
l_\'l l:C
short. Except of course if the man
can’t dance. Some reason that no one
can see the mistakes in dance steps
from under long skirts and some sa_y
that so long as the skirts “are ﬁlmy
it doesn’t make much difference.”

When Cap and Gown chorus girls
were asked about their dresses, they
were willing to wear them as high as
eigh't inches above the knees. In their
opinion the hips are the limit. There
is no dissenting vote when short skirts

~ are brought up.

If the girls want their bean): to
decide upon the length of tlie.ir ove-
ning-gowns, the decision is already
made in favor of longer and more
‘transparent ones.

(Continued from Page One)
was given to the world in 1922 as a
result of his researches‘ and clinical
experiments at the University of To-
ronto. Hospitals and the medical pro-
fession, over the entire world, have
sincethat time applied the treatment
Sir Frederick introduced, with the re-
sult that thousands of lives have been
saved and millions of men, women,
and children with diabetic tendencies
are being enabled to lead useful and
productive lives through the use of
this pancreatic substance, syntheti-
cally manufactured.

As for the work of the Institute
itself, ten new industries have been
brought into being through applied
research fellowships during recent
years.

These, and the development or in-
vention of about 650 new processes
and‘ products, are among major ac-
complishments of the Institute since
its founding in 1913, according to
Dr. Weidlein. The Institute’s work
with vinyl and other resins, leading
to large-scale production of five new
plastics, has been especially notable.

New industries also have been built
on the results of research into the
recovery of various by-products of
coal and coke, some of them resulting
in such products as disinfectants,
fungicides, insecticides, varnishes,
paints, resins, electrical insulating
materials, turpentine substitutes, wood
preservatives and many other
branches.

Stage Fright
i_May Assist

ln Speeches

Lomas Finds Students
Will Give Better
Talks When Afraid

Stage fright isn’t the scare it’s
‘cracked up to be, after all! Speakers
who are “scared stiff” before an audi-
ence do better than those who never
suffer the agonies of stage fright at

all, according to the results of an ex-
periment conducted by Charles W. Le-
mas, director of" the Men's Debating
Association at the University.

In this experiment, which he tried
on high school students, Mr. Lomas
found that those who were frightened
before their speeches but calm when
once started talked more fluently than
those wi'th stage presence. Some of
the poorest speeches were made by
students who didn’t lose their fear.

These results were discussed by
Mr. Lomas in his article, “The Psy-
chology of Stage Fright,” in the cur-
rent Quarterly Journal of Speech. He
also pointed out that there was no
exact prescription for the cure of
stage fright, but he offered several
hints for its treatment. -

iNew Thermometer l
To Measure High Temperature

nvented

A ‘Instructorlnltvtetallurgy ji

Gages Heat Electrically .

Dr. George V R. Fitterer, in-
structor in metallurgy, has iii-
vented a new super-thermometer
for use in testing the tempera-
ture of molten metal.

Many attempts have been made to
construct a thermometer‘ that would
withstand the extreme heat without
melting. Dr. Fitte.rci"s tliermometcr
is made of a mixture of carbon and
silicon carbide, capable of withstand-

ing ‘temperatures upwardsof 3000 dc— '

grees Fahrenheit.
‘\‘\’l:(-n the instrin'nent is placed in

the metal, the contrast between the _

hot end and the cold end creates an
electric current; thus, the hotter the
metal, the more electricity that is
generated.

.Dr. Fittere.r’s temperature-taker is
a rod eight feet long and two and
one-half inches in diameter. It is at-
tached to an electric galvanometer by
which the temperature is read.

Twenty-ﬁve thermometers, all de-
signed by Dr. Fitterer, are already in
use, ten of them in the United States
and the rest in Europe. Each one is
custom built to meet the needs of the
mill in which it is used.

the tunes is “Our Shadows,” with
‘fI’m Sold On “You” running a close
spcond. There are" 17 numbers in all.
3 For "three days last week, the com-
Iiany traveled about ‘upper Pennsyl-
vania playing one-night stands in

 Bradford and Erie. A performance

scheduled for Johnstown had to be
cancelled because of high water.

f Throughout the trip, a drizzling
rain kept swelling-the streams, al-

-_ ‘most covering the highways in several
places. Scenery and costumes, which

liad been shipped to Johnstown, were
soaked with water and had to be
renovated for each performance.

In Bradford, though there was no .
water in the streets, orchestra men

were unable to play in the orchestra —

pit of the New Bradford Theater at -

an afternoon rehearsal because of .

water in the pit.

Returning to Pittsburgh immedi-
ately after the Erie show, busses were
forced to detour three times. Just
outside of Meadville, two of the
busses went through a marsh which
covered the road.

Tops of white. poles, which line
curves in Pennsylvania roads, were

" used as guide posts in the dark by

drivers. When the road became
straight again, the poles disappeared.
and drivers had to move slowly in
order not to run oil’ into the swamp.

Further on, a dense fog kept the

‘ company from getting into Pittsburgh

on time.

Scenery has been repainted and,
costumes have been cleaned and
pressed for the showtonight, which
will be the most important perform-
ance of “Trailer Ho!” yet given.

Johnny ‘Urban stfole ‘individual

the ﬁeld with the speed ‘of ‘a big red

; country. However, you could hardly

describe Johnny as deﬁnitely inter-
urban, for he made few or no stops
on his sparkling runs.

From‘ the side lines Goldberg, who

Varsity Looks Good

‘ The streamlined I-‘lan’thers looked
surprisingly good in contrast to past
"Saturday performances. The pass dc-

ifense looked not too good, especially —

‘in the early and late stages, but the
men with the greater glirtli found
themselves just a few years slow in
picking up Matesic’s aerial heaves.
When the heat wave took control
along about the second quarter, the
old line began to showyits age.

We repeat, frankly, the New Pan-
thers, sprinkled with plenty of Rose
Bowlers, showed some stuff. De-
fensively, the line was tough to dent,
even when Heinie Weisenbaugh, the
“Flying Dutchman,” and -Dick Mate-
sic, pro battering ram, banged into
the Panther forward wall. Weisen-
baugh’s sheer power carried him to
short gains early in the game, but
even those were held to a minimum.

Bill Daddio came in from the golf
links long enough to pull in a nice
pass from Patrick and pick his way
expertly downﬁeld to score the second
touchdown of the day late in the first
half. Don't be surprised if you see
this boy messin’ around in a Pitt
backfield someday. He's an ex-full-
back from Meadville and knows what
to ‘do with the ball when he wraps
his arms around it.

Both varsity tackles, Matisi and
Delich, caused all kinds of trouble in
the old—timers’ backﬁeld. On one oc-
casion, the latter pulled, down Matesic
for a 12-yard loss, early in the game.

Sta-pulis and Patrick gave evidence
that the kicking situation is still in
good hands, and the former showed
some “ripping” tactics that you may
hear a lot about before many fall

HE latest story making the campus rounds
T informs us that a candidate for SFA has
only two worries-; either he will be elected or he
will not be elected. If he. is not elected’ "he has
no more worries._ But if he is elected he still has
two worries: either he will be elected to the

executive committee -or he will notbe elected to,

the executive committee. The first step in.—this
process of elimination was taken _two._._week-ends
past and the second is well under way.

Today, although___tl_ie dijscussioifi ifs‘ of no highly
vital importance t‘o"=mos't of the‘~Univ‘e'rsity stu-
dents, thereare 12 “Independents'””iniSFA who
are doing some-.concentrated w,o‘rrying"_"about
this executive committee. The IQ fraternity as-
scmblymen are, of course, entrusting their wor-
ries to Boss Barr and Phi Ep I-I,ar_nb1_1r_g," and
Lucy Conn, possibly. This triumvirate need hard-
ly lose any sleep over its position. This side is
virtually assured of election.

But with the “Independents” it’s a different
story. They are wondering who’s going to get
what._And with _McQuade coming up for grad-
uation, there’s some "speculation as to who is to
be boss. Bill Stark, Ernest Rose, and Verna
Douglass will probably/"receive the “independ-
ent” vote for Executive committee, but it would
hardly be expedient to count out Schultz or Al
Kairys, the junior man whose 366 votes set a
new high individual election record.

Figuring to an extent in the Independent plans
are the votes of the two real Independents, be-
longing to Lea Goldstein and Nick Spanos.
Bosses Rose and Stark are taking it pretty much
for granted that these two votes are not going

"to fraternity men. This, however, is debatable.

Boiling this down we are sure that the fra-
tcrnitics with their 16 undergraduate votes plus
the additional help they will reiceivcfrom ad-

ministration—faculty regulars will elect, three’

from” that faction to the executive» committee; "It

is fairlycertainthat two-y‘ear'sen'4ior Barr would.‘
‘run things efficiently as chairman‘. There is also

the possibility of a fourth fraternity man on the
committee if the two Independent votes go to
fraternities within the group. This is, of course,
a remote possibility at present.

. When the back-room conferences are over and
all the whispering is done, the various members
will likely sit back and forget all about any mo-
tives or ideas they might have had during the
pre-election period. \

It is unfortunate, therefore that the various
groups are organized along such ﬂimsy lines. If
there were deﬁnite platforms, party ideals, or
similar lines for organization in‘ contrast to self
or group advancement idea from purely personal

points of view, the situation would be more en-

couraging. :

As it is, it looks like a divided student control
between the "Indcpendent” and Fraternity fac-
tions with the administration-faculty Assembly-
mcn once again at the helm, holding the “balance
of power.”

Shades of Hades
Classes in interior design and industrial creation
in the college of architecture and fine arts, Univer-
sity of California, were astonished to find that pow-
der, puffs were required tools in the course.
“Now, boys, gras our owder uffs firml in our

The point to it is that powder puffs are used in

By Nick Spanos
Stars Shine at Penn

The marquee at the Penn says “A Star Is. Born" but

as far as I’n1 concerned it’s twins at least. ‘Both Janet

Gayno_r._and. Fredric March turn in the best perform-
ances of their ﬁlm careers and shoot back to the top
from which they had been slipping recently. Ilowevcr,
to limit the orchids to Gaynor and March would be un-
fair. Evcryone connected with the making of this super-
lative ﬁlm rates a bouquet.

Here was a story, in which Hollywood could have
become as gushy and unreal and blubbering as a column
by Dorothy Dix. Instead, the makers showed surprisingly
good taste and common sense. William _Wellman, in di-
recting, and Gaynor and March, in acting their highly
emotional _ roles, display a restraint which 1S seldom
seen. Adolph Menjou as the suave magnate and Lionel
Stander, the gravel—voiccd press agent, also turn in

‘highly satisfactory. renditions.

It surprised me that “A Star Is Born” should be so
excellent 21 ﬁlm. This is particularly so in view of the
fact that the plot‘ is soiold and hackneyed that even
a third grade child could see thru it. It’s the old Cin-
derella. story that the movie magazines have been bleat-
lug aboutifor so long. -

I - ,“Estl1cl‘ Blodgctzt,” a small town girl, is stage struck.

She comes to Hollywood where she meets nothing but
discouragement and Andy Devine. Finally she gets a

break. Norman Maine, the cu.L'rent- Robert ’1‘aylo.i.‘, sees 

her at a party where he is a guest and she IS a
waitress -and becomes interested. One thing leads into
another and soon Esther is playing the lead opposite
Norman.  ~

Norman is it peculiar cliuractcr. Ilc doesn't like the
bright lights and tinsel of Hollywood lifc. Liquor is his
escape mechanism," (Soc Ho 'l‘alkcd ‘To’-Himself for
cxpl.), and it sccm:_~'  tl1o’l1c‘s had just one too many
whisky sours. Anyx-'va,v he soon becomes a hasbcen and
his disintcgrzitiou .ai1d ‘Estl1cr’s loyalty are portrayed
thru the last llalfnof the picture. '

Out of this ancient. stull’ Dorothy Parker and others
liave fashioned 21 script that is packed full of smart,

crisp dialogue and -"situations that grip and hold. All in -

all “A Star Is Born” is one of the ﬁnest things over
to come out of Hollywood. You’ve got to go and you
know when you’ve -got to go you’ve got to go. ‘

"Call It A Day" With Ina Ray I

Everyone is calling “Call It a Day” a hit but, as is
my custom, I don’t think I’ll go that far. It’s a pleasant
picture all right, but not that good. “Call It A Day”
was adapted from a stage pl.ay of the same name, ‘and

. the. "play received few if any rave notices. I -don’t see

why the picture should do better but that's beside the
point. . '
- In structure “Call It A Day” is reminiscent of such
pictures as “Dinner at Eight.” It has no particular plot
but instead follows, the members of a middle—class Eng-
lish family thru the first day of spring. I suppose I
got off on the wrong foot, as it were, with this ﬁlm.
You see it sccmcd to me as tho tl1c‘rc__wc'rc too much
noise and repartee and too little sense in the opening
scene, which shows the family getting out-,o'f bed.
..Anyway, all thruithe picture everyone seemed to be
yelling S()1llCtlll1'lg“‘l1l12ll}'2J.lW;lyS began with “J-olly well
. . ” and ended with “rii—iight.” 'l‘liat_{rnay have been
to give an English touch to the wl1olc‘busi.ness but it
got on my,ne1'ves.. However, as soon as I got accustomed

to this peculiarity I began to like the film. It was full_

of some alright cracks that are as subtle as any it has

been my pleasure to hear. Particularly all right was ~
the actress who phoned her manager that sl1e.couldii’t "

make the show because she was going to bed with a
nervous headache. ,. '
Thj_at’s just a small sample of what you’ll hear if you
keep.-«your ears open and don’t eat candy. Of course
c1‘acl§s"like that _might_ throw grandma into a lather

__,b_u't_;.Tit’ll cost ,_yo’u at least two bits plus tax to hear

them and whoever paid two bits to hear grandma. The
lines ‘in this picture are pulled by a ca.st which, altho

"it contains none of Hollywood’s greats, does include

names which a1‘o‘[-familiar to theater-goers.

Ina Ray Hutton and her Melodears do their swing-
ing on the Stanley stage this week, and how they can
do it! Ina herself swings it to all points of the com-

pass and even tho her band was not so hot, no one felt '
that there was a crying need for good mus_ic.~-AA-long with .

In1a.a1‘e three tap dancers and a young fellow who fol-
lows__ his nose and» does some good imitations.

Alvin's Nancy Not T_oo.Fancy

“Nancy Steele Is Missing” at the Alvin and so is the ,

punch from the last half of this picture. For about
15 minutes I thought that at last here was something
dill"e.1'ent. Here was Hollywood putting over some good
propaganda for peace. Here was revolution on a small

scale. But 15 minutes was too much. After that, Nancy " -

Steele and her story resorted to the old formulas and
the picture lost interest. .

_ Victor Mcluiglcii has the main part in this ﬁlm. ‘Ilc
IS a waiter in an exclusive New S:'ork club at the out-
break of the war. Victor has already been thru one war

and he agrees witl1_T‘ almost everyone, including Big Bill- . .,
Stark, that “war is hell.” Unlike most of the otlicrs,--

McLaglcn does something about ~stopping war. "He kid-
naps the baby (lau—g'htcr of Mr. Steele -(Walter Con-
noly) who is thcimunitions king in hope of forcing‘
‘Steele to_ stop his work. ' ‘ - .

Fate and Hollywood sccnurists intervene‘ and Victor‘
goes to jail on an ‘assault and battery sentence that is

.._s';f.1'.etc,l1ed by-- the judge to two years because l\ﬂlcLaglcn

liasstrong views for U.- S. neutrality. The jail p-rovidcs

"the" setting for one of the movies’ most i1'onic?"sccncs._

;When the whistles blow and the bells "ring to announcc
our entrance into the war the convicts stand in their
cells and cheer and beat the bars and sing, “My coun
ty tis of thee, sweet land of liberty . . -”. - ’

What happens to the baby daughter who grows"up to
be June Luiig? W11-.‘lt happens to Walter -Coimolyf.’ \\-"ll-at
happens to Victor McLag'len after he-serves a “life”
te_rm‘.’_ What does Peter Lorre do with a mustache‘ and
without-an accent? Did McLaglen stop the war? No.

By ROBERT BROWN
Fully adequate for students looking up re-
search niaterial or merely lilling up 21 free per-

iod or two, the iiiagazilie collection of 'tlIe“ii11e" '
‘arts lil)1'ary is comparatively as complete as
'thc book and pliotograpli clepai‘tI11e11ts.

According to Miss Sarah St. John, librarian, the de-

ipartment subscribes ‘to 36 nlugaziiles, and annually re-
Qceivcs about 30 art catalogues from the leading galleries
"and museums of the-country. Magazines in the collection
‘range from scholarly (and expensive) treatises on the
iteclmicalitiesof various Byzantium mosaics to the out-
spoken doctrines of the “Art Front,” oﬁicial organ of
-the Artist’s Union. ‘ '

In the current issue of “Art Front,”_ there is an inter-
esting article entitlcd, “l Defy Aragon,” by Salvatore

-Dali, foremost living surrealist. Louis Aragon was a
‘former surrealist, who could not subscribe to one of Dali’s

proposals," z1_iid‘i1i"‘t_h;is "article, Dali takes a healthy re-
venge by paniiing -Aragon. - ,

A Dali recentlymade headlines by lecturing to a London
audience in -a deep sea diving suit, and, because he didn’t
know how to ‘work the thing, almost suffocated before
the ushers :1‘el"C::1:Si‘3'('l_l1ll11. He speaks to reporters witha

"loaf of b1‘ea,d,hala11_ccd'o11 his head.

7 ‘ Dali’s p_r'op,osal that started the controversy was this:

“In 1932 . :  described a, complicated project for a

surrealist object to he called, “thinking machine,” for
which several huildrcd gcblets would be ﬁlled with 'wa.rr'n
milk and hung--so‘ as to confo1'n_1 with the structure of a
large rocking chair.” I

. Possibly the 111z1:;'zi;5ii1e best adapted for the average

‘reader is the “llrlz1gaz:ne of Art,” published by the Amer-
ican .Federation of Arts in Washington. In the issue

which this writer.'examined there were four pages of
superb reproductions of etchings by Rembrandt Van

Rijn, anal an ;:,:'ticl': on Lc'o1i'l~Iroll, winner of this yea'1"s

Carnegie International prize.
Many of the artist’s"best works are featured in the
article. A piece of advice from Winslow Homer, Amer-

.ica"s. great-seascape painter, is included. On examining
some of Kroll’s character etchings, Homer remarked,--A
,“Paint ﬁgures, my boy, leave rocks for your old age,-

they’re easy.” . .

Priced at l.-l1l'€(~.“ dollars per copy isthe Art Bulletin,
illustrated quarterly edited by the University of Chicago.
Most of the writings contained in it are theses, for de-
grees. There are ﬁne reprodllctions of old, aliriost for-

_gotte_n paintings of “madonn'a's_ of humility,” found,

‘after intense research, in the old abbeysalid n1o_nas_te1'ies
of Italy’. . 2  4 
, Most ofltlic paintings were done around the theme of

the .~sca'l.ecl madonnu with the Chris-t-child who, “devoutly

cncliynaiide with souereyne joyc take hym in hir-a‘rn1es

'Kubla Khan’ And Hashish

 

_.; ..._.. ..

The professional and accepted literary critic, we admit,
has us puzzled. At times he requires sense, hard and
logical sense, in a piece of writing to gain his approval;
again he is lifted out of himself by a mysticism that he
cannot explain, and he proclaims the work magniﬁcent.

He declares that Popc’s Essay on Man isia ﬁne inter-
pretation of the philosophy of humanity, we1l—expressed
and well-deﬁned; 5then he scuttles around to the other
side to tell us that? Cole1‘idge’s Kubla Khan, while it says
that which he does not understand and suggests that
which he doubts Coleridge to have desired to express, is

' ‘also a clacf cl’oczwo'c.

Kubla Khan, he declares, possesses a rhythm that ap-
proached hypnotism, if poetry can ever be hypnotic,
demonstrates a delicious atmosphere of unreality, be—“
cause the mixture} of dreamy romance and illogical de-7
tail cannot be fouiid. Frankly, we are befuddled.

We have read Kubla Khan several times; we have
reread Coleridge's‘introduction to the poem, which may
or may not be rationalization. We have wondered at the
statement that Kubla. is a fragment. Certainly it seems
to be a unit, if the essences of a theme are signiﬁcant.

And then we have considered another possibility:
could not Coleridge have written the “fragment," as he
called it, in a sleepy sort of after-dream; reading it. later
in a more sane mood and failing to understand what it
meant, could he not have decided that for its music_zi.1ouc
it was worth while, but, since he could not again rcacli
the emotional heights of its composition, could not even

~ ‘make sense of his poem, had he not best label it a frag-

ment and let it goal that?

Hypotheses, of 'cburs'e, are dangerous, and espccial_l_v
with respect to poets and their product. ‘The hypothesis,’
however, does seemito warrant some consideration. ‘A

What is our judgment of K-ubla. K_hain?_ Out of accord
with the literary critique, but possibly in accord with
the critic himself,‘-we say that Kubla Khan should have
remained what Coleridge labeled it: a fragment. -

Furthermore, it should have remained in that calegI.v1‘,v-

‘ in which he places much of his work: an experiment.

Possibly we are too harsh, and ’-you, Mr. Critic, -will, to

express it mildly,‘fa1l’ito agree with us. But let us be

even more harsh and have our say. _ _ V . V
:’Kubla K}I.(L‘7L is a mixture of hashish and quinine, was

 written in intoxication, was criticized with p'a.troi1iza.tion.

was printed because readers did not understand what it
meant, but thought that it should mean something very
beautiful. As you ma'y'un(lerstand, we are not advocates"
of poesic p-Me,’ we .. leave melody to,music"' where, we
think, it belongs. But we do not know‘ whether--all ﬁelds
of poetry have been charter. Kubla Khanmay have been
the beginning of a poetic. revolution, and no one recog-
nized it. We do not know. If poets are to bombard a new
forte in which syllables are used to achieve, an effect of
melody and words are tossed to the side as being too
sensible, then we suggest that Kublu Khan be "used as
a practice model. "

But if you follow this suggestion, you must strip Kubla
of his very undergarments of meaning, change the words
to syllables, and turn him loose as something very naked
but very beautiful.

Still there are parts welike. The ﬁrst ﬁve lines are
g1orious—one of the ﬁne creations of hashish. The next

forty lines are too fulled with hashish to be creations.

The last two lines are almost sensible again. And there

the poem ends-——a fragment.
