Operator Assistance To
Cost Consumers A Dime

By SUE MCFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Days are numbered for the free
use of directory assistance in
making phone calls, including those
made through University’s Centrix
service. ,

Bell of Pennsylvania will levy a
10-cent charge on some uses of
directory assistance within the
consumer’s own area code, beginn-
ing Feb. 12.

The new plan, recently passed
by the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) will allow consumers three
free calls to directory assistance per
month within their own area
codes. Any number of calls
exceeding this limit will carry a
10-cent charge, billed to the caller.

A credit card, collect call or call
placed to directory assistance with
the help‘ of a regular operator will be
billed at 20 cents per call. Directory
assistance calls to outside area
codes will remain free, according to
Bell service representative Joan
Pring.

With the new Bell plan, the 411
directory assistance number will be

replaced by 555-1212, which may be»

dialed to reach information for all
communities within the caller’s
area code zone. M
Pring noted not all -directory
assistance calls within the caller’s
area code zone will be billed.
Among the calls not carrying any
charges are those made from
coin-operated telephones, hotels,
motels, hospitals and mobile or
maritime services. All handicapped

/

individuals should contact the Bell
business ofﬁcei to secure forms
exempting them from payment of
the charge, Pring said. Other
provisions have been made for
businesses that make frequent use
of the directory assistance service.

Pring explained Bell records
indicate most calls to directory
assistance are for numbers already
listed in the caller’s telephone
directory. Although these calls are
made by a small percentage of its
customers, she said, there has been
a marked increase in Bell’s
expenses as a result. This increase
was shared by all Bell customers,

regardless of whether they used the

service, Prin g added.

Pring said the new charge is a
way of making only those customers
who use directory assistance pay. In
Delaware, where a similar directory
assistance charge is imposed, 95
percent of all customers accumulate
no directory assistance charge on
their monthly bills.

Pring said Bell has issued a list of
suggestions to its customers to
reduce their use of directory
assistance. The suggestions are:

Call the Bell business office to get
out of town directories for
frequently called communities.

Inform friends and relatives of
modified telephone listings so they
can avoid calling directory assis-
tance. . ‘

Keep atlist of phone numbers to
avoid repeatedly calling directory
assistance.

Correct Pitt's Priority
‘Imbalance’ Payne Says

Bernie Payne, in his last report as Student Government Board
president, called on the incoming SGB to continue addressing an
“imbalance” in University priorities toward teaching and research.

Speaking at last night’s SGB meeting, Payne said he was concerned
about “a great imbalance between research, teaching and community
service” here.

“And teaching, at this point is taking second place,” he added.

The outgoing SGB president said the board should work toward
ensuring Pitt emphasizes teaching, adding ‘ ‘we made good inroads this
year” with the English competency requirement, the Undergraduate
Academic Review and the Honors Program.

‘ ‘Don’t let the issue drop,’ ’ Payne told newly elected board members
at the meeting, including current SGB members Dave Hesidence, Josh
Bayslon (who will succeed Payne), Diane Behers, Stan Galanski, Jan
Medoff and Bernie Popko.

The new members will be inaugurated Monday night and assume
their board positions Wednesday.

In other business, the board moved to survey students’ response to
the plus/ minus grading system CAS reinstated last term.

SGB member Dave Garger, who formulated the project, said he
believed the grading system adversely affects students for a number of
reasons. Its “side effects should be looked into.”

“We had plus/ minus for a term now,” Garger said, “and it can be
examined.”

Few Students
Carrying Two
Majors Here

By DAVE KIRSHNER

Some Pitt students apparently
have difficulty holding onto their
second major.

According to Rhea Bass, assis-
tant to the Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, an increasing
number of undergraduates are
considering having more than one
major. However, recent ﬁgures
show only about one-ﬁfth of the
students here actually graduate
with a double major.

‘ ‘Out of the 243 B.A. (Bachelor of
Arts) recipients who graduated last
August, 47 went for double
majors,” Bass said.

“Students who decide they want

’ to take a double major are not

required to report the second major
to the dean’s office,” she said. “We
don’t want students to feel there’s
pressure to complete these two
majors.” , -
As a result, the number of

students carrying two majors is not.

know. Bass said she believes,
however, more students are avail-
ing themselves of a double major.

The task can prove too arduous,
she said. “Some are not willing to
go-for the whole business. Others, I
guess, get tired of school.”

Students who complete a double
major seem to lean toward the
humanities.

“English and speech are always ;_

high in enrollment,” Bass said.

Thornburgh the County’s Choice for GOP Gov.

  x

By TOM KUKUCKA’

Pitt News Staff Writer

Allegheny County Republicans showed their
support for Richard Thornburgh at a Republican

Committee meeting Tuesday night in the Syria‘

Mosque.

Termed by GOP chairman Ted Jacob as the first
“Republican Gubernatorial Party Convention,” the
meeting was convened to allow county
committeemen to hear speeches by five Republican
gubernatorial hopefuls, and cast their support for
onecandidate. ~ —

Thornburgh clearly won the committeemen’s
support, garnering 309 votes (64 percent) of the
ballots cast. Former State House minority leader
Robert J. Butera was runnerup with 128 votes.

Other announced candidates who spoke at the
convention included State Senate minority leader
Henry Hager of Williamsport, former Philadelphia
district attorney Arlen Specter and Alvin Jacobson of
Abington. -

Party members also heard two candidates for
lieutenant governor, Faith Ryan Whittlesey
(Delaware County Council president) and State
Senator George Gekas. The convention cast its
support for Whittlesey, who picked up 221 votes.

Committeemen also voted to support an “open”
primary this year, meaning the Republican State
Committee will not endorse any specific candidate
for governor or lieutenant governor.

Party leaders were not bound by votes cast at the
Tuesday meeting, according to Jacob.

“We are just asking th.e committee people who
they feel should be the next governor,” Jacob said.

It was undoubtedly Thornburgh, a native of
Western Pennsylvania, whom party members came

to ‘hear. The crowd’ at times waved campaign signs

and chanted names in a manner similar to political
rallies and state and national conventions. Most of
the signs and cheers were directed toward the former
Federal prosecutor, whoreceived the longest and

"loudest

ovations as he asserted the Shapp
administration has neglected Western Pennsylvania.

“lt’s been over 30 years ‘ since a R_epu"blican
governor from this country has led the state,”
Thornburgh said, “and our highways and bridges
show that it’s been 30 years.

“No one here needs to dwell on the failure of the
present administration," said Thornburgh. “Milton
Shapp recently asked Jimmy Carter to" declare
Pennsylvania a disaster area. Shapp has made it a
disaster area over the last seven years.”

While Thornburgh presented himself as’ the
candidate from-the West, Butera and Specter, both
eastern candidates, stressed the need for organization
andcohesion among Republicans across the state.

“We Republicans must have the strongest party,
and put up the strongest candidate, to win the
election and defeat the Democrats,” Specter said.
“We must bring back good government to the
Commonwealth.”

Few Double
Maiors At

University

(Con/inuedfroiii Page I,

Bass believes most students
originally take a related area that
subsequently becomes their second
major. They might say “I already
have 12 credits, I might as well.”

According to Bass, of the 168
students who graduated: with a
Bachelor Of Science degree last
August, 13 chose a second major.

She said the core sequences
required in natural science pro-
grams may limit potential double
majors.

“Maybe in some of the natural
sciences there is not as much
freedom to take electives,” Bass
said. “There is not the room to put
in another major.”

The completion of two majors is
not noted on the student’s diploma,
but is recorded on his transcript,
“which is the ofﬁcial document of
the University,” she said.

Bass said she sees the increase in
prospective double majors as a
positive step. “I can’t see any
reason why it wouldn’t help.
Students have Our full support.”

Radiation Discovery Renews Fear

By The Associated Pi-9“

EDMONTON, Alberta—Canadian and American nuclear emer-

A gency specialists Thursday headed toward a remote trading post in
Canada’s far north where airborne scanners found unusually» high
radioactivity, possibly contamination from a Soviet satellite that fell

Canadian Defense Minister Barney Danson said in Ottawa there
was a “90-percent chance” the radiation came from the
disintegrated nuclear-powered Cosmos 954 orbiter, which carried
100 pounds of enriched uranium 235.

“It’s either a piece of debris or the greatest uranium mine in the

A specially equipped Canadian military plane detected the
"radioactivity late Wednesday night while ﬂying over an area about
90 miles outside Baker Lake, an outpost of 1,000 people in frozen
tundra country 1,100 miles north of the U.S. border in Minnesota.

It was the first sign of unusual radioactivity since the crippled spy
satellite dropped from outer space and fell apart in ﬂames over
northwest Canada early Tuesday.

Miners Block Coal Shipment
By The Associated Press
F REEPORT, Pa.—Defying a court order, a rowdy band of striking
United Mine Workers stopped 34,000 tons of coal from being
shipped Thursday on the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh area coke

Over 100 coal miners, a few carrying clubs, walked past three
carloads of Armstrong County sheriff’ s deputies and forced
Freeport Terminals Inc. to close its coal-loading operations.

Company president Ralph Nicholas Jr., stopped one of his
employees from moving a front-end loader toward the stockpiled
coal after meeting with a group of the miners in his office.

Shapp Cleared of Campaign lmproprieties
By The Associateu Press

PHILADELPHIA—The state Supreme Court, in a 4-to-2 vote
made public Thursday, upheld a lower court ruling clearing Gov.
Milton J. Shapp of violating state election laws concerning
campaign funding during his 1974 gubernatorial campaign.

Justice Louis Manderino, who wrote the opinion, said, “We
conclude that the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed the
complaint and therefore afﬁrm its order.”

The case stems from a June 1976 suit brought in behalf of ﬁve
Pennsylvania Republicans, including former state Rep. Robert J.
Sen. Richard J. Tilghman,
admitted that at least $102,060 was collected on and after election
day 1974, but never reported to the Bureau of Elections.

Eight Dems Announce Candidacy for Lt. Gov.

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Eight candidates, including deposed Common-

Committee on Thursday they are seeking the party’s nomination for

The committee then voted to leave the race open, permitting the
voters to decide who will join the Democratic nominee for governor
on the November ballot. The governor’s race will also be open.

Tucker, who was fired by Gov. Shapp last year because she
allegedly used state employees to write her speeches, joined the
crowded ﬁeld with a ﬁery speech.

Also seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor
are Delaware County Councilman William Spingler, Sen. Michael
O’Pake of Reading, Philadelphia register of wills Thomas I:eonard,
head of the Department of Property and Supplies Ronald Lench,

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Meet the Candidates

With the passing of the Student Government Board elections last
week, the major political excitement of 1978 is over. But there still
remains the minor matter of the state primaries in May, and,

further down the road, November’s general election.

In light of

last year’s political adventures, we think students would do well to
get involved in this year’s race, at least to the extent of voting

intelligently.

Because of the chief executive’s influence on budget-making and
budget-passing, the gubernatorial rate is of special interest and

import to students here.

On the Republican side, Richard Thornburgh, Arlen Specter and
Robert Butera look ‘to be the strongest candidates. Thornburgh
and Specter, ex—Pittsburgh Federal prosecutor and ex-Philadelphia
district attorney, respectively, probably will make strong showings
in their own ends of the state. Whether Butera——who led the State
House fight against a tax hike last fall——can slip in between them

An Outraged Commuter Complains

Ihave never been so outraged at a
major institution in my life. Friday,
Jan. 20, I went through an ordeal
that was totally unnecessary. If
someone at the University of
Pittsburgh had assessed the danger
of the weather situation and called
off school, students wouldn't have
had to go to the extreme
inconvenience of making their way
to the Oakland campus. I can't
imagine the administration would
not have more consideration for the
commuting students and teachers
at the University. The smaller
colleges and trade schools managed
to assess the situation and realize
that to ‘ask their ‘students and
teachers to attempt attending
classes was out of the question. Yet,
the major college in this area

J.P. Stevens Workers Really Are Sat

By DAN MULHOLLAND

The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences-Graduate Student Organ-
ization (FAS-GSO) ’recently an-
nounced their group has ‘joined a
growing number of organizations
that are staging a boycott against
products manufactured by the J.P.
Stevens Company. This boycott,
the current cause celebre of the
liberal community, is ostensibly
aimed at so-called unfair labor

practices engaged by the company. ,

No doubt many of the groups and
individuals involved in the effort
are quite sincere, but due to the

neglected to make the obvious
decision to close schools early
enough. I certainly hope that in the
future the right and obvious
decision will be made promptly.

Battling the computer at Hillman Library: How to Win

Hillman Library has many good
and bad points, as do most things.
Many of the employees are friendly
and helpful. Their selection of
books is really pretty good.

But for the past three years, the
computerhas been the enemy of
many students. I seem to be among
those who are on its black list, and
it will do anything to try to keep me
from checking out ‘ books. Its
favorite and most successful trick is
to grind out overdue notices for
books that have long since been
turned in. At least twice a term, it
pulls this trick on me. Once last
term it even went so far as to bill
me for the book—$12 for the book
and $10 in ﬁnes. I had looked
all over for t at book, and was
almost certain didn’t have it. My
borrowing‘ privileges had been
cancelled until the money was paid.
I almost paid the bill, but then I
was informed that if the library
later found that book, after having
been misplaced by them, I would
probably not get my money back.

instance, an employee who failed to
appear at the NLRB hearing, and
another who admitted hitting his
boss, were both ordered reinstated
with back pay. In another case, a
weaver who spoiled four times as
much work as her co-workers was
put back on the job because the
agency believed she had been ﬁred
for engaging in pro-union activi-
ties. Numerous other examples of
such heavy-handed NLRB action
against Stevens abound-

But the real complaint of both
the NLRB and the boycotters is that
J .P. Stevens has stiﬂed union
organizing efforts. Such charges
are unfounded. There have been 40
unionizing campaigns at Stevens
plants. Out of these have come only
15 ‘requests for elections. In only
one of these, a very close,
contested election in 1974, has the
union been successful.

Why the poor track record for the
union? Simple: the Stevens work-
ers are satisﬁed with what they
have. The Richmond News Leader
reports the average Stevens worker
earns $4.25 an hour, only 25 cents
less than the national average for
textile workers, a difference that is
explainable since most of the
Stevens plants are in the South,
where the cost of living is lower.
Moreover, the union organizers
have turned off many workers by
their tactics. The Amalgamated

“Ahah,” says the computer,
“What a great way to get new-
books!” So I turned rebellious and
decided to wait.

Several days later, in one of my
classes, I noticed a student had a
copy of the book. I wrote down the
call number, and indeed, that was
my lost book. I charged over to the
library and excitedly explained I
had located it. After two days of
checking, they discovered it had
never been lost, but had been
turned in and checked out by
someone else. The computer
almost got me that time.

After all this practice, ‘I have
learned how to partially win this
ﬁght. This‘ information may help
other unfortunates beat that
troublesome computer. Make a
habit of:

Listing each book by its call
number and recording its due date
and when you returned it;

Writing down the name of
whomever you talk to about the
missing book—other employees

Clothing & Textile Workers Union,
at the forefront of the anti-Stevens
movement, has been cited by the
NLRB themselves, for using
intimidation and even physical
violence in their organizing efforts.

Why then have so many joined in
the Stevens boycott? Most of them
are woefuly uninformed or misin-
formed. The media has by and
large painted only one picture of
the controversy, one in which J .P.
Stevens has been portrayed as the
worst employer since Ebeneezer
Scrooge. But the leaders of the
boycott have no such excuse. Big
Labor, which started this hullabal-
loo, is mainly interested in
breaking Stevens so their plan to
unionize the South will be
successful. If it is, the political
power of the AFL-CIO will be
greatly enhanced, but the rank and
ﬁle worker will gain little, save the
higher taxes and higher prices that
always seem to accompany union-
sponsored legislation.

The liberal and radical groups
that have jumped on the band
wagon are there for a different
reason. There is nothing that galls
them more than seeing a private
concern turn a proﬁt, while at the
same time keeping the majority of
its employees satisﬁed without
uhion or government interference.
Hence, they . must conjure up
imagined wrongs where none exist

-\..>

listen much better when they know
whom you’ve talked to before;

Not paying for a lost book until
you are certain you have indeed
lost it:

Checking to make sure the book
isn’t on the shelf—the computer
often “forgets” to look there;

Asking that they put a search on
the book. If you do this by phone,
check in person as soon as possible
to make sure a search form actually
was filled out—and keep a record of
when and by whom;

Carrying any slips the library
sends with you all the time; and

If you ever get shocked by
receiving an overdue notice on a
bunch of books you’ve never seen
before, your ID card probably is

punched wrong. Get a new one as ~

soon as possible.

If all of us on the computer’s
black list do these things, we can
put that darn computer in its
proper place.

s N ow’s The Time To Buy A Typewriter

By DAVE Mc DONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

As almost every Pitt student realizes, there will come
a time when you must hand in a typed paper. This
leaves you with several options: have a nice friend type
the paper; pay someone else to type it (this costs about
$1 a page); type it yourself, using the pay typewriters in.
Hillman Library (this costs 25 cents every half hour);
borrow a typewriter from a friend; or buy your own.

You can rent or buy a new or used manual or electric
machine. Renting a typewriter is about as economical
as using the typewriters in Hillman. An average rental
fee is $20 a week or $90 a term. For these prices, you
could put the cash toward your own machine, and have
it half paid off. Buying a used typewriter, particularly a
manual model, is a good idea. Used manuals, dusted
and with a new ribbon, can type as well as any new
model. A used manual costs from $25 to $75. Be more
wary of buying a ‘used electric typewriter; it is more
likely it will have something wrong with it.

If you buy a new typewriter, you must consider its
features. Depending on the number of features, a
manual costs from $49 to $149. The price of an electric
portable varies from $129 to as much as $350. Unlike
pocket calculators, whose prices have declined in recent
years, typewriters continue to increase in price, so now
is the time to buy.

Pay only for the features you want and will use. For ’

example, it doesn’t make sense to pay $350 for a
machine with changeable typeset, unless you will spend
most of the day in front of it.

When buying an electric model, you must decide.
whether to pay an extra $40 for an automatic return.
However, in choosing an automatic return over a’
manual return, you will pay for parts that may prove
faulty.

There are two sizes of typewriter carriages, 10-inch
and 12-inch. The 10-inch size costs less, so unless you
plan to type on oversized paper, the 10-inch size will
suffice. 1

Another new feature is the cartridge ribbon. In the
Coronomatic, by Smith Corona, changing the ribbon is
similar to changing an eight—track tape. This expensive
model comes with cartridge ribbons of different colors
and one for fixing mistakes. Along with cartridge

typewriters costing more, an additional expense will

occur because the cartridges only last one-fifth the
length of time that comparably-priced regular spool
ribbons do. 9

Nearly all typewriters have tabs, but if you are going
to type footnotes, bibliographies, or special forms, you
may want to invest more money in a machine that can
set and clear tabs. A typewriter with pre-set tabs will be
good enough. _

The more expensive models also have impression
or touch controls. These may be needed when using
carbons, but the extra control does little except raise the
price.

Another thing to decide is whether you want the large
pica or the smaller elite type. The pica type is easier to
read, but the elite looks more impressive. On almost all
models you will have this choice.

Another feature you may want to pay extra for is the
repeating key, which may comprise the x, hyphen,
period, underscorer and spacer. For vertical spacing,
especially for typing footnotes, a model with a carriage
that half-spaces may be useful. Also available for the
lazy typist are automatic margin sets and automatic
paper injectors and ejectors.

When shopping for a typewriter, after you find the
model that suits you, go to at least three stores and
compare prices, warranties or guaranties. Also discover
if the store services the typewriter in its own shop or if
they send it out. By going to five stores selling
typewriters, 1 found prices vary on similar models by as
much as $50. A popular model, the Underwood 565,
varied in price from $169.50 to $179.95. One should
remember that specialty stores, like Leslie Dresbold and
Philip Wiener, service their own machines, which give
you more personalized service and faster repairs.

Also remember that the lower-priced machines may
not withstand as much use as a sturdier, more expensive
model.
models, with their many features, have more parts
that could break down.

Keep an eye out for sales on typewriters, particularly
after Christmas. There may be a bargain out there.
With the rising cost of labor and parts, prices keep
climbing, so if you are planning on buying a typewriter,
now would be a good time.

On the other hand, the more expensive‘

besides, they are more difficult to get along with and more of

T Bancroft, MacLaine Beach ‘The Turning Point:

By BETSY NORMAN
. PittNewsStat‘t'Wnler
The Turning Point
Directed by Herbert Ross

_You never stop doubting.

Past choices come back to haunt
you. Did I make the right decision?
Would I be happier with a career
than with marriage and three kids?
What if I had stayed with my
career? Whatif I hadn't had a
child? What if...?

“The Turning Point," directed
and co-produced by Herbert

S

Ross, deals with these questions.
Two women whose lives took
separate paths meet several years
later, only to face their own past
choices.

Emma (Anne Bancroft) is an
aging ballerina. Deedee (Shirley
MacLaine) isvmarried and a mother
of three, who believes she could
have been what E-mma is. Years
before, the two were rehearsing for
the same role that could have been
the key to one’s success. Deedee
then married andibecame pregnant; ’
Emma won the role, 19 curtain
calls and a world-wide reputation.

Now, Deedee’s daughter Emilia
(Leslie Browne) joins the dance

company, has an aﬁair with a
young Russian dancer (Mikhail
Baryshnikov) and faces the same
decision as her mother and Emma.
Do I continue dancing or do I give it
up for marriage and children?

While Bancroft and MacLaine get
top billing for the ﬁlm, the real star
of the movie is the dancing. Em-
ploying the American Ballet
Theatre, among the world’s best,
and ballet material including
Vortex (choreography by Alvin
Ailey), Le Corsaire (choreography
by Petipa) and Anna Karenina
(choreography by Nahat), the ﬁlm
offers the ballet fan la creme de l.a
creme. Even people who are not
ballet fans are dazzled by the
spectacular dancing of Browne and
Baryshnikov.

Despite the criticism, the Village
Voice was correct in reviewing the
ﬁlm in its dance column. While
Ross and screenwriter Arthur
Laurents say the ﬁlm "is not about
dance, nor is it a dancer's story,”
you can easily forget the plot and
concentrate on the beauty of the
dance sequences.

To do the ﬁlm justice, one should
see it twice. The second time, the
faults are more apparant, but the
true story is revealed. The
excellent acting is more obvious,
the scenes that work are out in the
open and the emotions and pains
are felt.

Many claim Emma and Deedee
are not satisﬁed with their choices.

The second time around. you
realize the two are doubting, but
not regretting. They received what
they wanted—what they really
wanted—not what they fantasized
about. Emma may dream of
motherhood, but she prefers
dance. Deedee may dream about
stardom, but she is satisﬁed with
children and her husband.

The ﬁlm's big surprise is the
excellent supporting cast. Dee-
dee’s husband, played by Tom
Skerritt. stands out. A veteran of
dozens of guest-starring roles on
television and movies, like
“M*A*S*H,” Skerritt makes many
of the scenes in the movie. He is
the most believable character and
the most realistic. Family scenes
between Skerritt and MacLaine,
where one would expect MacLaine
to be dominant, showcase the extra-
ordinary talent of Skerritt.

Leslie Browne is a much better
dancer than actress, but success-
fully uses the camera to her
advantage. Director Ross did a ﬁne
job in making a dancer an actor—in
this case anyway. The same doesn’t
hold true of Baryshnikov. He
should stick to dancing in the
future.

Daniel Levans, who plays an
obnoxious young choreographer, is
another welcome surprise in the
ﬁlm. While he is on screen less
than 15 minutes—two here. three
.there——he sticks in one’s mind.

The ﬁlm doesn’t live up to the

hype that preceeded it, but few
ﬁlms do. MacLaine and Bancroft
are as sharppas ever, which is
surprising considering neither have
done ﬁlm work for several years.

Bancroft has changed little since
her portrayal of Mrs. Robinson in
“The Graduate." She is still

beautiful and still an artist.

Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft portray two friends who envy each other’s

lives.

Bancroft will be tough competition
for Jane Fonda and Diane Keaton
in this year's Oscar race.

The ﬁlm is worth spending a
hard-earned three or four dollars.
The dance, the acting and the
directing make it one of the better
ﬁlms this year.

Craziness is Sane in ‘Outrageous ’

By RON NYSWANER
Pitt News Staff Writer
“Outrageous”
Written and Directed by
Richard Bonner

“Outrageous,” for all its up-.to-
date references and deadpan sexual
sophistication, is built around a
hackneyed theme: crazy people in a
crazy world are really more sane
than anyone else.

Like “One Flew Over the
Cuckoo’s Nest,” Richard Benner’s
ﬁlm turns a psychological table,
asking, ‘ ‘Who should be the patient
here, and who should be the
doctor?” Unlike “Cuckoo’s Nest,”
the ﬁlm expands the question,
challenging not only the psycho-
logical standards of sanity, but
other cultural institutions——such as
heterosexuality—as well.

The ﬁlm’s star crazy is Liza
(Hollis McLaren), a diagnosed
schizophrenic who is chased by
phantoms from “the other place,”
where they ‘speak “the other
language.” Leading the chase after
Liza is “The Bone Crusher,” who
wants to take her back to the other
place, because, as Liza says, “I’m
the one born dead.”

Liza escapes from a mental
hospital in Toronto, where she lived
for eight years (wouldn't you be
seeing bone Crushers, too?) to the
apartment of her best friend, Robin
Turner, a hair dresser in love with
icons from the Golden Age of
Hollywood. For Robin (Craig
Russel) Bette Davis, Joan Craw-
ford, and Marlene Dietrich are
heroines because “they were
tough.” They didn’t go through life
like it was a can of Coca-cola. They
had fun, “they dazzled.”

Robin and Liza share more than a
mailbox and the bathroom. Robin,
like Liza, has spent his life
confronting “normal” institutions.
Robin is gay. Liza is schizophrenic.
Robin speaks for them both when he
Says: “At 14, llooked in the mirror
and said to myself, “Robin Turner,
you’re different.”

Benner’s script celebrates
Robin and Liza’s kind of being
different. We see normal people
(like us?) throw cold stares at the

pair, call them names or tell them,
over and over again, how sick they
are. But like Robin and Liza, we
know the truth, we get to look
through the looking glass in the
right direction. We see Liza’s
mother and nurse and Robin’s
friends and customers living life
inside a Coke can. From Robin and
Liza’s side of the mirror, if their
kind of being different is sick, then
thank heavens for the disease.

The association between Liza’s
phantoms and Robin’s homosexual-
ity is touchy: for too long
gay people have been saddled
with cliched notions of homosexual-
ity as something to be cured, or
tolerated if uncurable. But Liza,
with her rantastic visions of a
surreal world replete with jesters as
beautiful as dragonﬂies, isn't sick.
She is special. Just as Robin, with
his love for other men, and his
longing to be as tough and dazzling
as Bette Davis, is special. From
inside each there are stories and
magic and beauty and love. Liza’s
magic ﬂows out through sometimes
funny, sometimes terrifying hallu-
cinations. Robin releases the
“different” within by daring to
love men, and impersonations of his
beloved women.

Robin goes drag to a party one
night, and his Tullulah Bankhead is
such a smash that a local club hires
him to do more of the same. Robin
premieres there as Bette Davis, and
his opening line to the all male
audience is: “Anita Bryant sent me
down here to straighten you guys
out.” Soon Robin and his troupe-

‘Joan Crawford, Barbra Streisand,

Bette Midler, Carol Channing,
Pearl Bailey, and others—is
working in small New York clubs,
“dazzling” his audiences to the
hilt. Liza—pregnant---stays in To-
ronto, waiting for the birth of her
child to prove that she is not dead
inside, but very much alive.

Craig Russel, who has been
impersonating women for a long
time, brings Robin’s heroines to
life, so that they almost take over
the movie. The aura and energy that
made Davis, Crawford, and Strei-
sand stars, is almost like Robin and
Liza’s brand of eccentricity, as if
those great women are linked to
Robin and Liza because they share
the same kind of madness that made
them fight, made them tough, and
helped them win what they want.
This eccentricity is what Russel
resurrects from these women and
really what audiences best remem-
ber. The audience bursts into
applause when Robin says: “I’ll do
Judy,” and then begins Garland’s
“Give My Regards to Broadway.”

When Liza’s child is stillborn, she
becomes convinced the phantoms
had been right: She is dead. Robin
takes her to live with him in New
York. Her ﬁrst night there, as Robin

is about to leave for a club date, she
stares mute and blank. “I am
dead,” she says. “You are not
dead, ’ ’ Robin tells her, “but you are
getting boring.”

Liza is taken to Robin’s

performance by his taxi driver-cum-
agent, who is macho, bearded and
also gay (Robin said when they met,
“Isn’t anyone straight anymore?”
His friend’s answer: “Yeah, my
father back in Montana.”) Liza
wanders around the seedy club as
Robin’s Peggy Lee sings, staring at
the faces of men as they watch
Robin, or hold and kiss each other,
as they smile and laugh with Robin
and Peggy Lee. Then, backstage in
his dressing room Robin tells Liza,
in the voices of all the women he has
let step out of his own voice and
body, that she is mad; but what the
hell, so is he, and they still know
how to have fun, how to dazzle, and
how to love each other.

Outside again, Liza and Robin
dance with the bar’s customers. The

gay people surrounding Liza and.

Robin have come to the bar because
there they can let free what.
elsewhere-in the world with its

assumptions about what is norﬁ’ 

and abnormal, sick and healthy,
straight or not-so-straight—they
must keep hidden away. In that bar,
ﬁnally, gay people are free with
their love for each other and Robin
can let his hidden women escape.
Liza, dancing and laughing looks
about the bar and announces, “The
bone crusher isn’t here.”

Robin and Liza have built a world
in which the friendly phantoms can
‘come alive, and the bone crushing
institutions of doctors, hospitals
and homophobes—all those things
that try to tie up the life inside of
“special” people——have no power.
“They spoil special people,”/Li_za
said. Robin and Liza con§k:J%
dancing. They are alive. "

Traclisters (1-0) to Host Ninth Annual Pitt Invitational  

ByMARIASCUILLO
Pitt News Staffwriter

A ﬁeld of 18 teams is scheduled to
compete in the ninth annual Pitt
Indoor Invitational track meet,
which begins today at 3:30 p.m.,
and continues tomorrow afternoon
with ﬁnals in all but one running
event.

Coaches Mike Agostinella and
Dan Sullivan agree that four events
in particular should feature poten-
tial NCAA qualiﬁers—the 50-yard
dash, two-mile run, high jump and
mile relay. ,

East Carolina's sprinters ar

heavily favored to place in the
shorter races. Otis Melvin and
Donnie Mack of ECU already have
qualiﬁed for the indoor national
championship with times of 6.1 for
60 yards. Also contending for
honors in the 50 will be Ernie
Halstead of East Tennessee and
James Weal of Delaware Staten,
along with Pitt’s Ed Taylor and
Buddy Morris. Trials for this event
begin at 6:30 tonight.

The Panthers have an excellent
chance of seeing Mel Boyd contend
for first-place honors in the
two-mile. East Tennessee's Ray

Cagers ’ Victory NotPretiy Picture, 2-74  

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

CLEVELAND—It wasn't a mas-

terpiece, but Tim Grgurich and his
Panthers will take it. Their ninth
win of a strange season was in many
ways a routine vanquish-by-
numbers job, and it came against a
team whose February schedule
‘features a home-and-away series
with Robert Morris, but Pitt’s
basketball Panthers left here 9-6
and vsatisﬁed Wednesday night
after clipping Cleveland State,
82-74, at Public Hall.

The opposition—CSU’s loss was
its 12th—and the surroundings-
Public Hall is to basketball as the
Syria Mosque might be (if
Pittsburghers were so stupid)-
were contributory factors, but the
main reason behind Pitt’s relatively
effortless performance was its
schedule. For the past month, the
Panthers have been extending
themselves three times a week
against the meat of its schedule.
Even when a butterball like Robert
Morris was the opponent, the
Panthers had to put out for the Field
House fans.

Always on the horizon, however,
was Cleveland State. The Vikings
were 6-11 before last night’s game
and didn’t have the talent to
compete with Pitt during warmup
drills. The game was played in a hall
that resembled a museum. Though
the crowd was CSU’s largest
home gathering "of the season, it
comprised but 1,980 persons, and
only those Lorain, Ohio residents
who came to cheer Larry Harris
genuinely were concerned about

' more than the area’s worsening

weather forecast.

,And so the Panthers’ task was an
easy one. At least, it became one
after Pitt had erased an early CSU
lead of seven points. The lead
bounced between 10 points and 14
points for the balance of the
evening. I

“It looked like we were still on
the bus from Pittsburgh during the
ﬁrst ﬁve minutes,” Grgurich said.
“‘But then we adjusted, and did
what we had to do.”

Though the team did little more
than that, several Panthers played
well enough to merit attention.
Sam Clancy was in large measure
the difference between the Pan-
thers and Vikings. Displaying body
control a playmaker could envy, and
that useful ability to rest his elbows
on the rim for extended periods of
time, Clancy collected 14 rebounds
and 17 points.

Sophomore Ed Scheuermann also
gave Pitt 17 points. Pitt’s ﬁrst
high-post player in years threw in
three straight baskets at the time
the Panthers were building their
initial 10-point lead. He also had
ﬁve assists.

, Pete Strickland, coming off the

bench for extended periods of
playing time, worked well at point
guard. His 10 points were more than
triple his average output, and few of
his eight assists were cheap.’

Pitt’s high scorer, however, was
Harris. It was fitting that on “Larry
Harris Night” Pitt’s 6-6 senior
swing man would lead his team,
even if his performance was little
better than average for him. Harris
shot 60 percent from the field (9 of
15) while amassing 22 points and
the only decent applause of the
evening. 7

Dave Olinger hit three of fou
ﬁeld goal attempts and ﬁnished
with eight points for Pitt. Wayne
Williams, who is continuing the
painful conversion that has taken
his from high school center to
college point guard (via forward and
wing guard), had three steals, four
rebounds and six points pefored
becoming the only Panther to
garner ﬁve fouls.

Cleveland State coach Ray

Dieringer didn’t have much with ‘

which to work. His guards, Franklin
Edwards and Greg Cobb, pestered
Pitt with 44 points, but the only
assistance their teammates could
offer came in the way of vocal
encouragement.

“Pitt just had too much
underneath,” Dieringer said, “and
that too much was wearing number
41 (that’s Clancy’s license plate
number in Ohio).”

Sonny Lewis was parked in
Pittsburgh Wednesday. The 6-3
sophomore from Schenley, after
missing Tuesday practice, was not
on the team bus Wednesday
morning. Grgurich said after the
game Lewis knew -he would not have
played at.Cleveland, and that he

expected Lewis, who had escaped\

from Grgurich’s doghouse long
enough to be sixth man at
Cincinnati Monday, to attend
yesterday’s practice.

A Pitt spokesman, however, said
yesterday that Lewis “wasn’t seen
on the floor during practice.”

Writers have been asking Lewis
almost since the season’s begin-
ning if he plans to transfer, and he
has yet to give-a straight, “no,” for
an answer. Actions, however, have
been known to speak louder than
words.

PITT NOTES—The Panthers
travel to Stﬁe College tomorrow for
a game with Eastern Eight rival
Penn State (8 p.m., WTAE radio).
PSU is led by guard Jeff Miller,
possessor of a good outside shot...
6-8 forward Gary Smith, a transfer
from Allegheny Community, has
been redshirted by Pitt. Terry
Peavy, the quick guard who
transferred with Smith. is consider-
ing a jump to Point Park, according
to published reports...Clancy led
Pitt in rebounding for the ninth
consecutive game...

Flynn and Mark Finucane have run
8:45 and 8:46 in this event,
respectively, compared to Boyd’s
8:46 run last year in the Pitt
Invitational. Penn State’s, George
Malley won the two-mile in 1977,
when Boyd was runnerup. Last
Monday against West Virginia,
Boyd easily won the two-mile, so
this will be his ﬁrst real challenge.
The high jump spotlights yet
another Pitt athlete, Dan Goodyear.
As a junior, Goodyear leaped to a
new Panther record of 7-1, which
also qualiﬁed him for the NCAA
championship meet. The senior is
the defending champ in this event,
but stiff competition in Saturday’s
jumpoff should come from ECU’s
Kurt Dowdy and F rostburgh’s Mike
Savoy, who both have cleared 6-10.
Again, East Carolina is a favorite,

this time in the mile relay. The
foursome already has turned in a
3: 15 clocking. Delaware State could
make matters interesting.

As an added attraction, a
fraternity relay has been listed on
the agenda. Twelve Greek teams
will compete tonight in an 880-yard
relay, with four teams advancing to
tomorrow’s ﬁnals.

Other promising events should be
the mile race, in which Allegheny
Community College’s James

Rotitch has run an equivalent of

3:58 and the 600, featuring
defending invitational champ Rob-
ert Bryant of Delaware State and
all-American Herman Maclntyre in
the triple jump. 4

Pitt’s entrants are: Dave
McDonald and Mark Studnicki

Shippen ,

(three-mile); Boyd and Bob Lee
(two-mile); Tom .Herrmann and
Randy Bailey (mile); Jack Cade and
Mike McGlothlin (1,000), Richie
Moore and Roger Winstanly (880);
Taylor and Morris (S0-yard dash);
Bud Cooper and Greg Conover
(600); Keith Bookert and Dave
Hensen (hurdles); Goodyear, Keith
Taylor and either Lee Kirby or Dale
Baker (high jump); Taylor and
Maydak (triple jump) and Robert
Clay and ‘Bookert (440). Willis
Shannon (880), Wayne Hursen
(440), Dan Dattilo (3/4 mile) and
Gary Siriano (mile) make up the
distance medley relay. Cade,

Winstanly, Herrmann and Moo‘.z{
are in the two-mile relay, while the 0

mile relay consists of Larry
Conover, Cooper and
Keith Leckenby.

Barcalow Stricken, Will Remain

By JIM PANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Len Barcalow’s career as Pitt’s
hockey coach was threatened
Wednesday when Barcalow suf-
fered what may have been a mild
stroke. Despite his questionable
health, Barcalow, who recently
celebrated his 68th birthday, vowed
to remain as Panther coach.

“Hell, I’ll be all right,” Barcalow
said. “As far as I'm concerned
everything’s O.K. I’ll be back.”

Bob Montgomery, one of Barca-
low’s ' assistant coaches, thinks
differently.

“When I ﬁrst found out that
Lenny was sick, I didn’t know if he’d
be able to coach again,” Mont-
gomery said. When I went to see
how he was doing, I took one look at
him "and told him to hang up his
blades. He didn’t look like he’d be
able to coach again.’,’

“Nonsense,” ‘ Barcalow ex-
claimed at his home yesterday.
“When it comes time for me to quit,
I’ll make the decision.”

It’s unknown whether Barcalow’s
attack, which impaired his speech
slightly and pulled his upper left lip
to one side, was a stroke or not.
Barcalow’s doctors aren’t ruling out
the possibilities of an affected nerve
or high blood pressure as possible
culprits.

“Whatever it was,” Barcalow
said, “we got it just in time. Just
like when Curt Hetz scored that
last-second goal in New York last

‘ year——we got it just in time.”

Barcalow’s physical condition,
according to Montgomery, had
been deteriorating since the

_ beginning of the hockey season. His

coloring, mobility and general
attitude were noticably changing,

: M9nts<2m¢r.xsaiide b.efor.e.h.<i t.°.°.k. a

sudden turn for the worse.

“l’ll be tip-top before you know
it,” Barcalow said. “My speec ‘—is_
coming back slowly, and not“
else was affected.” 5 I

Barcalow, who is planning to
retire from his job at North Park in
September an spend more time with
the hockey club, announced only a"
slight change in plans for the
remainder of this season.

“I’ll advise the team by watching
the games from the stands and let
Monty and Klemzy (Bob Klemz)
coach from behind the bench,” he

The Pitt track squad found it was
more than ready to face West
Virginia University last Monday
night when the Panthers buried the
Mountaineers, 93-38.

By winning all but two events,
coach Mike Agostinella’s team
easily erased the visitors’ 8-1 lead
after WVU placed ﬁrst and second
in the opening event, the long jump.

Pitt handily won the three-mile
run, as Dave McDonald and Mark
Studnicki crossed the ﬁnish line
together in 14:38. Pitt then picked
up three points for Richie Moore’s
second place in the half-mile
(1:57.9).

Agostinella said he was particu-
larly pleased with Tom Herrmann
and Gary Siriano’s early-season
times; they ﬁnished one and two in
the mile run at 4:15.1 and 4:15.2.

(Division III champion Fran Pres-
ley) after the first period,” Jones
s-aid of his pin at 6:17, which vaulted
the Panthers into an insurmoun-
table 14-8 lead. .‘ ‘After I got him on
his back, I didn’t want to let him
go.”

‘‘If that match would have gone
the full time, I don't think he (Jones)
would have won,” Millersville
coach Jerry Swope claimed. “Pres-

ley made the same mistake last
week, and lost against I.ock Haven.
I didn’t think he’d make the same
mistake again.”

 “i That mistake cost the Marauders

inomentum after building an 8-5
lead. Glenn Maxwell’s 5-4 victory
over Henry ‘Callie at 118 pounds was

Pitt Tankers

Face Challenge

‘Y  M
' By ANGELA VAVITHES

Rm News Staff Writer _

The next two weeks will’ be
challenging for the Pitt men’s swim
team. The first challenge will come
from the University of Maryland, (a
team ranked 10th in the east by the
coaches’ panel) Saturday at 2 p.m.
at Trees Pool.

“Maryland can be a tough meet
for us,” said coach Dick Bradshaw.
“We’ve only beaten them once in a

glual meet since I’ve been here. It's

as a good index, because if we
..,.eat Maryland, then we have an
excellent team.”

The number two ranked Panthers
will have their work cut out for
them. The Terrapins’ George
Carpousis specializes in the dis-
tance events, (1000 and 500-yard
freestyle) and, to make matters
worse, all three of the Panther
distance swimmers are out with the
ﬂu and may be unable to compete.

The Terrapins not only have
skilled swimmers, but strong divers
on both boards. Steve Shinholser

divers close

board and John Wolsh, victorious in
the one-meter diving atithe Penn
State relays last month, also will be
tough.

and setting up a Pitt 25-point
comeback.

Panther Ed Bredniak (150)
dominated Marty Hozella in the
third period for a 4-1 victory,
puttingthe pressure on Jones to
keep the momentum.

‘ ‘I didn’t really think they were as
strong as us physically,” Jones
said. “I knew sooneror later that I
was going to get him.”

Jim Gordon (167), George
O’Korn (177), Mike Palko (190) and
Mark Stepanovich (HWT) all won,
enabling the Panthers to breeze to a
lopsided victory. Gordon decision-
ed Mike Connor, 7-3; O’Korn
decisioned 6-2 Charlie White, 9-6;
and Stepanovich was given a
six-point forfeit decision over

.Wayne Witner after putting the
Marauder heavyweight down on the
mat too hard in the third period,
injuring his back.

But the most impressive of the
heavier weights was freshman
Palko, who won his ﬁrst super
decision—11-2 over Tim Howell-
in a Panther uniform.

“It just seemed that I kept on
getting stronger as the match went
along,” Palko explained. “He
(Howell) was getting weaker. I
wanted to try to pin him, but I was
afraid he’d slip loose.”

“I thought we wrestled very
well,” Panther head coach Dave
Adams said. “They were very
aggressive, and kept the pressure
on all the time.”

Pitt Scales Mountaineers

Pitt gave the same showing in the
50-yard dash, where Ed Taylor (5.4)
and Buddy Morris (5.5) outran their
Mountaineer opponents.

The Panthers’ Larry Shippen
turned in one of the East’s fastest
440 clockings so far this season,
winning the event in 49.8. This was
followed by the 600, where Bud
Cooper (1:14.9) and Greg Conover
(1:15.4) placed ﬁrst and second.
Pitt continued to rack up points as
Dave Hensen captured the hurdles
race in 6.6, and Mel Boyd (9:09.1),
Bob Lee (9:32.5) and Randy Bailey
(9:33) swept the two-mile. A
winning 2:l7.3 by Jack Cade in the
1,000-yard run rounded out Pitt’s
scoring in the running events.

In the remaining ﬁeld events, the
Panthers also ﬁnished one and
two—Keith Taylor (46’3 3/4") and
Don Maydak (46’l”) in the triple
jump, Mike Wallace (47’4”) and
