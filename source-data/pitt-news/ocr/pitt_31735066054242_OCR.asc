The portion of Bigelow
/Boulevard between the Cathedral
and the student union will defi-
nitely close on Sept. 16. .
Yesterday, after deliberating
for almost ﬁve hours over both
sides’ briefs, Judge Eugene B.
Strassburger III denied the peti-
tion to halt the city’s trial closing.
City Council President Jim
Ferlo, State Rep. Don Walko, and
the rest of the plaintiffs filed the
suit because they felt that the city
was simply giving the road to Pitt,
and that the temporary closing
would cause irreparable damage.
“There were two ‘ grounds
alleged by the plaintiffs: one, that
the city hadn’t followed certain
rules for the vacation of a road. I
found that this wasn’t a vacation
of the road, and they didn’t follow
the true meaning of the law,”
Strassburger said. “And two, they

Students who know what it’s like
to wait two hours in the financial aid
office only to find that the line for
registration in Thackeray eats up the
rest of the gorgeous summer day will
be ecstatic to find that the University
is listening to student complaints.

The provost’s office plans to rem-

’ edy student service problems by reor-

ganizing the offices of Admission
and Financial Aid; the Registrar and
Student Financial Services are under-
way.

The high quality student services
project is in ‘conjunction with the
provost’s initiative which plans to
spend $1.25 million on eight changes

over the next four years.

The changes will directly affect

Changes include anew recreation
building on the lower campus by fall
of 1997. Success of Lothrop Fitness
Center has propelled the project for
another student recreation building.
Of the $1.25 million, renovation of
Bellefield Hall was given $325,000.
This does not include $100,000 allo-
cated by the University capital bud-
get for staffing and security.

Student reaction to the upcoming
renovation was mixed.

thought that this would cause all
kinds of problems with traffic and
so forth. I felt that I could not sub-
stitute my judicial judgment for

' that of city council.”

In his written memo on the
case, Strassburger said this could
not possibly be called a “vaca—
tion” of the street because it was
not a permanent closing.

“[If the city decides to close
the street] we will cross that road-
way when we come to it. For now,
there is clearly no vacation,”
Strassburger wrote.

Also in the memo,
Strassburger outlined the rights of
the city tothe restricted area both
during and after the period of
restriction. First, the city can use
the road in cases of emergency.

Second, Pitt is not permitted‘

to block the area with anything
other than “temporarily placed
obstructions” which must be
“removable upon moments

notice,” and the city can remove
any such barricades at any time.

Third, no construction is per-
mitted in the restricted area. The
University is required to remove
barriers and return the street to the
way it was before “upon a
moment’s notice through the
appropriate officers” even if it is
before the street is officially to be
re-opened.

On the complaint that the city
did not have the three-quarters
vote needed to close a road,
Strassburger concluded it was a
valid argument. However, being
that Pittsburgh is a municipal cor-
poration, it has jurisdiction over
the state law that calls for a three-
quarters vote to close a road and
can over-ride such a law.

“I can understand the court
believing that a temporary one-
month closing is not a vacation

U.$. missles strike Iraq

Around the World

WASHINGTON — The United States
early today launched dozens of cruise rnis—
siles at “selected air defense targets” in Iraq,
the Pentagon armounced.

Pentagon oﬁicials olfered few details
but did say the operation involved Navy
ships and Air Force B-52 bombers. In
Baghdad, the Iraq capital, air raid sirens
resounded.

The missiles, which ﬂy like airplanes
and dive into their pre—set targets, struck at
targets in southern Iraq, the Pentagon said at
3:22 am. ET.

The targets in the 30-minute raid
involved command-and—control installa-
tions, missile sites, and radar installations.

President Clinton ordered the strike
against Iraq in reprisal for Saddam Hussein’s
offensive into Kurdish tenitory within the

I New dean focuses on

educating undergrads

For the past 26 years,
Professor David Brumble
has taught the undergradu-
ate masses the beauties of
the literature. Now, he will
be overseeing the academic
achievements of all under-
graduates as associate dean
for undergraduate studies.

“It’s exciting. My main
interest has been under-
graduates,” Brumble said.
“One of the wonderful
things about university life
is you get to do so many
different things.”

Brumble has taught
courses in medieval and
Renaissance literature,

- including a course called

Bible as Literature, which
he will continue to teach
during the fall. But his love
of teaching will not hinder
his dedication to the needs
of the College of Arts and
Sciences. ~

“I want to make sure
that the College of Arts and
Sciences continues to be
the efficient, thoughtful,

. and caring organization that

it has been,” Brumble said.
“The trains were running
on time when I got here,
and it’s important that I do

I what I can to make sure that

 

that continues to happen.”
In 1970, Brumble
earned his Ph.D. at the
University of Nebraska,
and shortly after began
teaching in Pitt’s English
Department. He hasibeen
very interested in American
Indian autobiographies and
has spent many years
studying the entire printed
collection. Inspired by the
writings of N. Scott
Momoday, Brumble has

written two books on
American Indian autobiog-
raphy.

“The book that is com-
ing out soon is a big book
on medieval and
Renaissance allegorical
uses of classical mytholo-
gy,” Brumble said. “I love
teaching. I love writing
books. The University has
sent me around the world.
It’s a very exciting life
because it’s so various.
Who knows what I’m doing
in five years?”

Brumble has many
plans for the undergradu-
ates, including an idea to
expand the internship pro-
gram to make sure students
can get experience through
internships. With his mind
set on a goal, he is opti-
mistic and excited about his
new position.

will be proportional to the
number of those factors.”

Oakland), one of the plaintiffs, said of
the decision.

Walko went on to say that he is wor-
ried about the blind and elderly that will
now have to cross busier intersections at
other areas in Oakland.

Pitt "spokesman Ken Service said
that he is very happy with the decision.

“I think that the University is con-
cerned with all the people in the area,
and part of the reason to have this test is

to find out what measures will need to
be taken to take into consideration
everyone concerned,” Service said.

Walko said that protecting his con-
stituents -in Oakland is his main priority.

“In a neighborhood where more
access is needed, it’s absurd to cut out
streets to make it less accessible,” said
Walko. “I respect Pitt as an institution
and will do everything I can in
Harrisburg for Pitt on every other
issue.”

City Council President Jim Ferlo
would not comment on yesterday’s rul-

 

ing

and looking to appeal it in court,” said
Paul Girdany, Ferlo’s executive assistant
and attorney.

. As for the section of Bigelow, it will
be closed from Sept. 16 until Oct.l5.

According to Service, the road will
not be able to be used for anything but
pedestrian traffic and Homecoming fes-
tivities.

“[According to the ruling] we
would be able to have any event that
would historically have been on the
street in the past, and Homecoming is
the only thing that occurs during that
time period,” Service said.

Fitness Center is more of a cardio
place and the Field House isn’t open
all of the time,” said Wes Henderson,
a sophomore in social work.

Adam Lewis, a Pitt alumni, feels
differently.

“Sure the majority of the campus
lives here but a lot of people will take
the easy way out by going to the new
gym and as a result it will close down
Trees. Why not renovate Trees and
put material and money into it? We
already have a great facility there,”
Lewis said.

was given to all undergraduate units

will depend on the area.

P/rovost Maher said that some
general ideas for freshman integra-
tion are visits to the museum and
freshman lunches.

Enhancement of campus safety
was allocated $175,000 for new
recruits, training programs, and
equipment. This fall six new recruits
will be added to the University of
Pittsburgh Police Squad.

The additional officers were
hired to enhance police presence in
Oakland at night and to impact stu-
dents’ perception about the safety of
the campus, according to the

provost’s report.

In the book “A Reference Guide
to Workplace and Criminal
Violence,” psychologist John W.
Addis noted that data gathered by the
Corp Institute on Alcohol and Other
Drug Studies based at Southern
Illinois University at Carbondale
found that 12, percent of college stu-
dents said they do not feel safe on
campus and 7.5 percent arm them-
selves with guns, knives or other
weapons.

According to the book, the
University of Pittsburgh can be
looked upon as a model for campus
police procedures because of ser-
vices, procedures, and recommenda-
tions provided to students and faculty

‘ Voice your views

The Pitt News is the voice of the students. Quite
frankly, we have been wondering what you have to say.
Through letters to the editor, you have the opportunity to get
up on a soapbox in front of every student and member of the
University of Pittsburgh.

If you have a problem with the University, write about
it Let ﬂie University know what you think of it. Are your
classes overcrowded? What about student life and opportu-
nities? As a student in a large university, the best way for you
to get things done is to speak up. In politics, for every letter
written to an elected ofﬁcial, it is assumed that at least four
people feel the same way. The fact that you took the time to
write down what you think gets your opinions noticed

There is more to student life than simply university pol-
icy and problems. The outside world still affects ﬂiose of us
here in academia This is an election year. There are still
panhandlers in Oakland. What do you have to say about
these things? .

The Views section of The Pitt News is devoted to
exploring the opinions of the student body. It is available to
each student at this university as a forum for their ideas,
expressed through letters and columns. All you have to do
is write.

You also have to let those of us here at the paper know
what you are getting out of it. Have an opinion on a story?

Vying to be the king of Arab solidarity

 
 

xr

On the eve of the recent Arab
summit in Cairo, the Syrian-bom
poet Nizar Qabbani published a
poem in the Arabic daily, Al-Hayat,
praising any measure of Arab soli-
darity due to the election of Bibi
Netanyahu. The poem contained
poignant sentiments, from a popular
voice echoing yearnings for “Arab
Unity” and the “Arab Political
Order,” ideals never realized at last
June’s Arab summit. And as new
regional alignments emerge, these
are terms which can now be stricken
from the current Arab political lexi-
con. ‘

The reﬂexive response to the
election of Bibi Netanyahu through-
out the Arab nations was to revert to
talk of Pan-Arabism. But these pre-

' tentious exhortations of unity cannot

disguise the fact that democracy
bewilders these autocratic rulers, the
youngest of which has been in
power for 27 years.

Now, in the aftermath of the
summit, it appears that Jordan and

the PLO have optimistic futures, but '

otherwise, the Arab region appears
more divided than ever, torn by dis-
agreements over relations with each
other and with Israel and America.
For example, Egypt, jealous of
Israel’s rising inﬂuence, used the
election of Israel’s hard-line govem-
ment as a pretext for leading a sum-
mit designed to entreat Arabs away

 

from a peace with Israel. But with its
leverage held in check in part
because of American monetary aid,
Egypt can invoke no more than stale
anti-Israel rhetoric.

Moreover, Iran, its suicide
bombers helping to end a milestone
peace process, can now begin eon-
centrating on destroying Arafat.

Between Harnas and ﬂie Likuds, it.

might succeed in turning the West
Bank into another Bosnia.

Finally, Syria, pleased that the
peace process has been derailed by
the Likud Party’s return to power,
has seized the moment to try to
reassert its leadership role in the
region by obstructing the alliances
emerging between Israel, the PLO,
and Jordan.

There are also Jordan and the
PLO, who, like Egypt, are largely
polarized along lines dictated by
partnerships with Israel that include
the Written promise of US backing
for their governments. However,
what distinguishes these two coun-
tries’ commitments from Egypt’s is
their prudence. Instead of groveling
about their overmastered states of
being and revving up the anti-Israel
engine, they, along with Turkey,
have emerged from the Israeli elec-
tions as the nucleus for a US-backed
axis based upon mutual economic
and security interests. .

Furthermore, there are the Arab
people, most of whom have just
come to support the peace process in
the hopes that it held the seeds to a

new Middle East, with more jobs,
more stability, and more freedom.
Now, with the peace process on hold
indeﬁnitely, the people of Egypt,
Syria, and Iran are watching as their
leaders contest one another for the
imaginary title of “King of Arab
Solidarity.” They will watch as their
leaders make them increasingly iso-
lated populaces in the regional and
international commrmities, and they
will grieve as their homelands
become even more economically
impoverished.

In stark contrast are the citizens
of Jordan and the West Bank, who,
led by more sensible leaders, will
have more gainful fates. As subju-
gates to America and Israel, they will
learn the ways and means of democ-
racy, they will taste some of its boun-
teous fruits, and they will prosper.

To make the ideal of Arab soli-
darity a reality, the Arab countries
must ﬁnd a collective conscience,
one that consolidates their interests
and responsibilities and upholds a
sense of cooperation. But is the ten-
sion and rivalry dividing them recti-
ﬁable? Are their leaders too accus-
tomed to an autocratic system of
governing and too weary to plan and
implement what is a democratic
aim? The dilemmas the Arabs now
face are imposing and perhaps solv-
able, but they will not be overcome
with impractical rhetoric.

~sion, little has been mentioned about how

the fans feel or the students body’s reaction.
In fact, few people gave a shit about us.

Last season, as John Ryan wallowed in
ineﬂiciency, we, the students of this ﬁne
institution, came under ﬁre.

As we took a stand, a stand against
Ryan, a stand for a new quarterback, we
were told by Head Coach Johnny Mqors
and several players that we didn’t know any-
thing. We had no clue what we were talking
about

Although none of us play football at
Pitt, most of us do know what it is like to
play sports. While we may not be gifted ath-
letically like varsity football athletes, we are

I as gifted intellectually as varsity football ath-

letes (some might say more gifted).
It’s not diﬂicult to conclude that Ryan

' sucked last season. And it makes simple

_ common sense to replace broken parts.

I’m not saying that anything is‘ broken
yet on this year’s installment of the football
team, but during the post-game press con-
ference, my ears heard words I never
thought possible.

Majors said, “I’m more disappointed
for everybody, including the team, and espe-
cially the people who love Pitt.”

No matter what may be said about
Coach Majors the next few weeks, at least
hehadthegutstoadrnitthatthisteamis
beginning to embarrass Pitt people.

This team does have talent, but this
team just can’t put it together come game
time. We, as fans, as the people who helped
lead this program to national status during

’_ the ‘80s, must not jump ship.

As frustrating as things have been the
last seven years, this program needs our sup-
port right now, more than any other time in
this school’s history. If we fail, not only will
the football team look bad, but it will cast an
ugly shadow for the rest of the country to
laugh at.

Pitt just suffered its most humiliating
defeat in years, and the campus doesn’t care.
“Hell, I’m sick of them losing.” “When are
they gomia win one?” “This team f@#king

Puzzlement, bewilderment, baﬁlement,
mystiﬁcation. Quandary, peiplexity, stupe-
faction and even hugger—mugger. These
terms canallbefoundinthe 1996 edition of
“Roget’s Thesaurus” under the heading
“conﬁision.” All of these terms could also
aptly ﬁt into a sentence describing Pitt foot-
ball following the conﬁdence-thrashing loss
to West Virginia.

There is no point in trashing the
Panthers at this point It will do no good Pitt
needs a lot more than criticism. This pro-
gram needs a Major overhaul.

It’s easy for fans to sit in the stands and
throw out insults and expletives at those call-
ing the plays, but not many people really
understand what’s going on in the huddle
and on the sidelines, myself included

These men are trying to do the best job
possible with the resources they_have, but
that hasn’t been enough over the past few
seasonshereatPitt. lnhisﬁrststintatPitt,
Majors won 33 games while losing only 13
and tying one. He spent 16 seasons at
Tennessee and compiled a 116-62-8 mark
ButsincehisretmntoPittin1993,hehas
gone nowhere but down.

He tookateamthatwas 1-10in 1972 to
a 12-0 National Championship in l976.This
is 20 years later, and Tony Dorsett is long
gone. Following the title in 1976, Majors
decided to return to his alma mater and
coach the Volunteers. It was a shock to the
Pitt Pf0g1'3m. but they dealt with it and
moved on to be rather successful over the
next decade. However, things don’t look as
goodaswe stareatan0-1 reoordthatcould
easily turn into another season—long laugher.

The Panthers have overtaken Temple as
the laughirigstock of the Big East, and the
only thing that can get them out of the cellar
could be a changing of the guard It could be
too early in the season for speculation, but a
program like Pitt’s can not atford to drag its
fwt any longer", something must be done to
save recruiting, fimding, and overall interest
at Pitt.

Johrmy Majors summed it up when he
entered the post-game press conference,
saying, “If no one has any questions, I don’t
have anything to say.” With reactions like
this one, it could be a long season for all.

for the Lady Panthers, serv-

“She’s a gutsy player,”

debuts with
a thud

 

Last weekend, it was finally time for
the brand-new Pitt women’_s soccer team
to get its feet wet, opening with two games
in Texas. Actually, everyone got wet on
the rain-soaked fields, but the Lady
Panthers got soaked twice, losing 12-2 to
Baylor and 12-0 to Texas.

In their first Division I NCAA game

ever, Pitt was beaten by Baylor last Friday
night in Waco, Texas. The game was also
the first-ever intercollegiate game for the
lady Bears. ‘

The teams traded goals early in the
game. Baylor struck first with a goal by
Nikki Hales 2:24 into the game. A minute
later, Pitt freshman midﬁelder Megan
Beasley tied the game with Pitt’s first goal
ever. After that, there weren’t many bright
spots for the Lady Panthers.

Pitt went into halftime trailing 6-1,
and not much changed in the second half.
With the score 9-1, Pitt’s AideeMia Mora
headed the ball into the net for the Lady
Panthers’ second and final goal of the
game at the 61:23 mark. Baylor added
three more goals to make the final score
12-2. Baylor also outshot Pitt 34-8.

There’s no reason not to complain; I do
it better than anybody. But people have to
remember that was the FIRST game of the
year. There still is plenty of time to turn
things around—evenfourorﬁvewinsisa
major improvement over last season. Things
take time; it took Moses 40 years to lead the
Israelites out of the desert.

Many may argue that Johnny’s been “

here three-plus seasons and the team looks
worse than ever. Maybe. But Johnny did
inherit a program that was bogged down
with violations and still had the same equip-
ment ﬁom his previous stint here. Miracles
don’t happen overnight

Auto traffic all travels one way (toward town) on Fifth Avenue.
BUT BUSES TRAVEL THE OTHER WAY, IN A SPECIAL BUS LANE.
They’re quiet. They’re fast. They’re big. They’re going the “wrong
way” on a one-way street. And those are four excellent reasons
to look both ways before you cross Fifth Avenue!
