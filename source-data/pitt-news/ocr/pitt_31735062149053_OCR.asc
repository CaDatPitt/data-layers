The ﬁrst Pitt dance ever to be held
on the Tech campus, the Military Ball,
is breaking more than one precedent.
It is also the ﬁrst big dance ever to
be scheduled for Cap and Gown week,
the only school affair, where an ROTC

the lone dance which offers favors to
men as well as women.

nia, will present" the Socialist answer
to the question, and Ned Sparks, Com-
munist organizer‘ in Pennsylvania, will
speak for the Communist party,

Each speaker will be limited to 20
minutes. a11d will draw for position
by lot. Following the speeches,
standing committees for the conven-
tion will be appointed, similar to those
appointed by the chairman at major
party conventions.

The University delegation will be
the largest single delegation in at-
tendance. consisting of 23 students
and faculty members. The Univer-

that this promenade will take place in
Thistle Hall, the largest of the three
Tech dance ﬂoors, and it is also ru-
mored that favors will be passed out
during this march. But the most im-
portant rumor is that bracelets will
not be given to the women. What wgll
be given, Lutz refused to say. ,

In addition to Stern’s orchesta,
Fran Eichler and Carl Eddy will play
in the adjacent ﬂoors to take care lot
the anticipated overﬂow crowd. And a
ﬂoor show, heralded as the usual
f‘.Greatest.-Show on...Earth,?f- will. add gm
the entertainment. _

When the ball was ﬁrst postponed,
the committee offered to refund the
purchase price on any tickets which
the buyers did not intend to use, but,
according to Lutz, there have been
very few such requests. This fact,
along with the fact that other tickets
are going rapidly, gives a rational basis
for the belief generallv held that bet-
ter than 1,500 couples will be dancing
to the strains of Eiohler, Eddy, and
Stern.

Tickets are still available today, and
may be obtained from committee mem-
bers or from the military department.

To ‘Swing It’ Hard

‘Godsend’ Pension, Melodies Mix
In Saffron-Spanos Concoction
To Be Offered At Nixon

_.

At the ﬁrst ﬂicker of the Nixon foot-

- lights tonight, 7'0-odd Cap and Gown-

ers are prepared to go “Out for the
Count” in the opening performance of
the 29th annual all-male show. The
cast and choruses have gone through
their ﬁnal lengthy rehearsals that be-
the direction of
Theodore Viehman and dance master
Gene Kelly.

Listed as a musical satire,-the Span-
os-Saffron script, the ﬁrst complete
student-written book in more than a
decade, portends to be a merry take-
off on the political headliners of the
day.

The plot hinges about the amazing
discovery of Dr. Casper Threepwood,
quack-medico de luxe, that leaves pa-
tients mentally young but eligible for
the ‘Godsend Pension’ at $2,000 per
month. After the curtain rises and
the opening chorus has shuffled off‘ the
stage, Threepwood is in the midst of
worrying about a threatened senatorial
investigation into his aﬁairs, a Su-
preme Court decision and the possibil-
ity that he is violating an interstate
mayhem law. Quintus Corpus, law-
yer, runs the legal side of Threep-
wood’s affairs.

Threepwood is played by Albert J.
Barr, BA37, while John VV_ Parks,
BA37, takes the part of Quintus Cor-
pus. Both Barr and Parks had lead-
ing roles in last year’s show “In the
Soup.”

Mayor *McFair Appears

To make matters worse, Threep-
wood’s daughter, Betty Jane, is in love
with George Titwillow, a radio gag
man. In turn, Chuck Carter, an old
college friend of Betty, is in love with
her.

'George’s gags gag Threepwood who

orders him from the sanitarium, Betty
Jane decides to hire a Russian Count
to insult Threepwood and make
George look good in comparison.
Chuck, who needs a job. hears of it
and poses as Count Diva.ni.
“ Tl1e“'sh‘ow"'goes on4through a sena-
torial investigation whose witnesses
include: Mayor McFair, played by
Michael M. Pejnovic, BA36; Vasil
Hairoff, merchant in death, John E.
D-anton, BA38; John Nance Garter,
vice president, John Rice, E39; Mor-
decai Pilbeam, a mysterious missing
link, Joe Madden, C36; and Percy Pil-
beam, his brother, Charles Allcroft,
BA36.

Vvilliam Collins, C36, takes the “fem-
inine” lead, Betty Jane. Opposite him,
Gene Burkhart, C36, plays Chuck Car-
ter and Count Divani. The gag man
is John P, Baker_ BA36.

Fifteen numbers both by students
and graduates will comprise the music
for the show. Among them, “You’ve
Got \Vl’lELt It Takes” and ‘‘I’d Do With-
out” are predicted as hits.

Parrish Gives Up A
Speech Direction

Professor, In Letter To Linhart,
Explains Reason For Action

Dr. VV. M. Parrish, professor of pub-
lic speaking, has resigned. At the
close of the present school year, he
has indicated, he will terminate his
12 years’ connection here.

Dr_ Parrish came here in 1923 as
assistant professor of speech_ Since
that time, he has been twice presi-
dent of the Eastern Public Speaking
Conference and except for one year
a: Cornell, faculty director of the
Men’s Debating Association. He is
the author of the widely-used book,
“Reading Aloud.”

Monday the outgoing professor ex-
pressed his reasons for leaving in the
following letter to Dr. S. B. ~Linhart,
secretary of the University:

“Dear Dr. Linhart:

“The intensiﬁcation of the general
unrest and uncertainty under the
present administration of the Univer-
s'._t_v impels me to refuse your offer
of reappointment for another year.

“My colleague. Mr, Murphy, 3. com-
petent and dynamic and popular teach-
er of eight years’ service, has been
dismissed by officials who admit that
they do not know him by sight and
that they have heard nothing but
good of his teaching. This action was
taken without the advice or approval
or even the knowledge of Professor
Hunt and myself who are the ones
most competent to judge his value to
the University. The Chancellor re-
fuses to explain this arbitrary deci-
sion, and he refuses to give me any
assurance that the rest of the faculty
are not subject to similar summary
dismissal. Suchirrational and irre-
sponsible authority cannot be endured
by men who are devoted to their work,
and who wish to have loya-lty and
pride in the institution they serve. I
have therefore informed Chancellor
Bowman that I will not accept appoint-
ment for another year.

“I shall leave the University with
sincere regret. During twelve years
of service I have become deeply at-
tached to its faculty and students, and
to the community of Pittsburgh. The
feeling of disillusionment and bitter-
ness prevalent among both faculty

wasteful while others maintain that
local care would be entirely made-
quate.

three questions and deposit the ballot
in designated boxes placed in Alum-
ni, State, and Thaw -Halls. in the Ca-

Not A Gesture

 lSA‘NO USE deceiving our-
selves any longer. The time for
sitting on the sidelines and idly dis-
cussing war and peace must come to
an end. Something must be done, and
done quickly, if there is to be peace.

This is not the time to debate
whether there are good wars or bad,
just wars or unjust, honora-ble wars
-or dishonorable. Modern war per se
is bad. and the sooner that we dis-
-abuse our minds of archaic notions of
sovereignty and national rights, the
sooner we'll realize this. As logical
propositions the arguments for “pre-
paredness" and “armaments for de-
fense" are as full of holes as a. Swiss
cheese. and any intelligent military.
man will admit this if you quiz him
persistently.

There is no one sure plan for peace,
just as there is no one single cause
for war. The real plan for peace in-
volves activity on a multitude of
-fronts at the same time. opposing re-
lentlessly anything which may be a
leading cause to war, be it militaris-
tic propaganda, infringements of civil
liberties, suppression of minority
groups, or economic imperialism.

The attainment of peace is not as
easy as rolling off a log. It is more
than just making up your mind about
it. Certain economic and class groups
with axes to grind try to stymie the
movement at every opportunity. Be-
hind abl_v-directed propaganda, which
may be based on any argument sult-
ing their purpose. these groups play
off divergent groups in the population
against one another, The old Roman
principle of “divide et impera” is prac-
ticed by the munitiou makers and the
jingoists with a ﬁnesse that would
make the ancients stand in unmixed
admiration.

There is no logic either in saying
‘that war is inevitable. Notliing is in-
evitable. and war is no exception.
Vvars are fought only when a substan-
tial portion of the population is in
‘favor of war; never when there is a
strong. active sentiment against it.

,Nor are wars fought for ideals or ab-

stract concepts; rather they are
waged for economic reasons in which
the business imperative of making
money is the highest law. The reve-
lations of the Nye Senate Munitions
investigating Committee proved that
beyond shadow of doubt.

Peace, then, implies a permanent
and active senfinient against war. -A
passive attitude is worth less than

nothing. The sentiment for peace
must be expressed in any manner
that may ﬁt its purpose. Peace as-

semblies. writings. peace balls—in
short. anyway at all. And that sen-
timent must be I)e1‘I11£111e11t. 110$ 3
once-a—year thing.

This morning over three hundred
thousand students go on _“strike”
against war. This is not an Idle ges-
ture or burst of heroics. It is *1 COW-
blocded. rational effort to halt the
forces making for -.1 new war. Most
'studeuts realize that if they expect to
live their allotted three score and ten
vears. tlu>y’ll have to see to it them-
-selves. The munition makers. the
Fascists. and tlie jingoists wm1’t.

So go down to the Coinmons Room
at 10:45 o‘cl-ock and take part. The
time off from classes isnt a free pc-

You Can’t Tell About Politics,

But Many Won’t Stop Trying

Betas, Alphas Come
Again——But Still
It’s All_Greek

That “hangover” period between
the general assembly elections and
the internal election of SFA’s ruling
executive committee has by this time
taken a pretty ﬁrm hold on the cam-
pus political leaders. The “hangover,”
strangely enough, has none of the
usual dissipated qualities, character-
ized by plenty of ice bags, ﬁzzing “al-
ka seltzer,” and loud. heavy moans.
Actually it is a more active period
than the events which precede it, at
least for an ambitious few.

The situation of 30 members of SFA
will perhaps shift in one or two in-
stances before the election meeting,
scheduled for May 12. but those ex-
ceptions will be fcw and extremely
“anti-Hoyle."

For purposes of illustration let us
designate the two deﬁnite groups as
“Alpha and Beta." This will be the
situation, then: This year’s “Beta"
group should, according to strength,
he called “Alpha,” but since this
might be confusing to those who have
been familiar with the Words as ap-
plied to former campus political or-
ganizations. the second letter in the
Greek alphabet will suffice.

“Alpha” involves personalities and
t‘ra.ternitics. ‘With the latter in
special dominance, this year's Alpha
group centers about William Schenck,
Phi Gam. Bill Blair, Delt, Al Barr and
Leo Ryan, Phi Kaps. and possibly sev-
eral women assembly members. Fra-
ternities represented in this division
would include Delta Tau Delta, Phi
Gamma Delta. Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Phi Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Theta Phi Alpha, Psi
Omega (dental). Phi Delta Theta, and
possibly several other groups in less-
dominant positions. It is the old
coalition that ran campus politics for
many years previous to the 1934
shake-up with the substitution excep-
tion of Phi Delta Theta for Kappa.
Sigma,

Today. no more than 13 members
of that group, a minority, were suc-
cessful in the SFA elections.

On the other side, the majority
group from the basis of campaign
combinations, the “Beta” for the pur-
pose of explanation again, is compos-
ed of 17 successful candidates who
have combined with virtually the

Ysame idea in mind as in the case of
“Alpha,” i. e. to aid in the selection
of members to the executive "commit-
tee. This, in the combinations of
both groups, has been necessary for
obvious reasons.

‘.‘Beta” centers about Bill LVIcQuade,
Gordon Rauck, Hubert Teitelbaum,
a11d again possibly several women as-
sembly members. It represents an en-
gineering, independent, and fraternity
combine. The fraternities represent-
ed include Delta Delta Delta, Kappa
Sigma, Zeta Tau Alpha, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Phi Epsilon Pi, Lambda Chi

and Sigma Chi.

A good prophecy would indicate

,that William lVIcQuade, Bill Schenck,

Gordon Rauck, Hubert Teitelbaum.
Bill Blair. and Al Barr will be very
nmch “in there” in the two—way scrap
for executive positions.

Just what will happen in the case
of the Juniors will be partially decid-
ed this week at the respective group
meetings, unofficial, as earlier ex-
p‘-ained. Senior women seriously con-
sidered include Lois Follansbee, Bar-
bara ‘Thomas, and Betty Rieger.

This, of course. is only the con-
sensus of “student opinion;” that is,
students who hold seats in the 1936-37
Assembly. Again, it is only an unof-
ﬁcial survey. and as that, should DI‘0V€
only reasonably correct.

Polish Guest

Rev, Andrew Krzesinski, pro-
fessor of philosophy at the Jagellon-
ian University, in Cracow, Poland,
will be the guest of the University's
department of philosophy at a tea. on
Friday afternon, April 24, from 4 un-
til 6 o'clock, in Room 1309, Cathedral.

Alpha, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Mu.,

By Robert Brown
Monday evening at the Nixon thea-
ter. a large audience heard the Men’s
Glee Club in a program ranging from
a digniﬁed Haydn chorale to a violinist
who seemedto be a cross between
Fritz Kreisler and His Honor Vvilliam
N. McNair.

To this reviewer, the Haydn chorus,
“Great and Glorious” was the outstand-
ing musical achievement of the even-
ing. The club gave this number a
good, solid and artistic presentation.

A sure-ﬁre number was the presen-
tation of the Ukranian folk song, “The
Cossack.” Also popular with the audi-
ence were the three Negro spirituals.
“Steal Away,” “Religion Is a Fortune,”
and the familiar “Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot.” The last disclosed a capa-
bly-done tenor solo by William Cover,
C38.

Pitts'burgh"s organist-composer, Dr.
Harvey Gaul, was represented on the
program by a. clever little dialect song,
“Ain’t It A Shame.”

There were other numbers done
with varying degrees of excellence.
The English round, ‘iH=ey, Robin,” the
romantic love song, “Thine Eyes So
Blue and Tender” by the Danish com-
poser Edward Lassen, and the ﬁerce

tribal chant, “The Moon Drops Low"
from Cadman's famous group of Indian

One of the big surprises of the eve-
ning was in the violin solos by Zareth
Yardum. He gave an astonishingly
fresh and vital rendering of Masse
net's “Meditation” from “Thais.”

Forrest Alter. C36, regular accom-
panist of the glee club, gave as his
solo the first movement of the Beeth-

“Pathetique.” He also provided cap-

Pitt Squad Enters
Penn Relay Event

Taano, Thomas, Bennett Expected
To Score For Panther Team

Pitt will be represented by the
largest squad of entries in its history
at the annual Penn Relays Saturday
on the University of Pennsylvania
track. No less than 15 Panther track-
men will compete in the ﬁrst major
event of the outdoor season.

Gene Taano, javelin-thrower, possi-
bly rates the best chance of coming
through in his event. Taano tossed
the spear 202 feet, four inches la.st
Saturday in the Temple meet. This
was his only official attempt of the
afternoon, and providing he can push
it just three or four feet further, it is
not unlikely that he will be up with
the leaders.

Art Thomas has been selected to
compete in a special invitational 100-
yard dash along with Jesse Owens
and Eulace Peacock. Pete Bennett,
provided that he has recovered from
an injured foot, is expected to make
3. good showing in the high jump.
Pitt's two-mile relay team, composed
of Harold Connelly. Charles Groat,
Harold Tost, and Alex Leggin, has
drawn the pole position in the two-
mile relay.

The sprint medley quartet, Thomas,
Connelly, Groat, and Mason, will
start in the third position. If the mile
relay team of Groat, Thomas, Tost,
and Connelly competes, it will be
handicapped in the ninth position.
Others who will take part include
Franklyn Theriault, George Cook,
Andy Lasky, Sol Menaker, Ed Spitz,
Jim Fassinger, and Walter Good.

Panther Netters
Meet Grove City
Team On Friday

Coach Dave O'Loughlin’s Panther
tennis team will open its season on
Friday afternoon against Grove City
it‘ the courts are in shape. The
match scheduled for tomorrow with
Bethany has been postponed until a
later date.

The ﬁrst match of the season
against Carnegie Tech was also post-
poned. Lack of good weather has re-
tarded practice, but Coach O’Loughlin
expects to get in daily workouts from
now on.

Most of the eligibles for starting
positions have been getting in trim by
using the indoor rectangles at Du-
quesne Gardens. Bob and Joe Mad-
den, Roy Heckler, Jimmy Thompson,
and Irv Solow are a few of the varsity
prospects who have been playing in-
doors.

Manager Eugene Cohen requests
that all freshman and varsity candi-
dates report at the Stadium today in
order to get their locker assignments.
Practice outdoors will get underway
this afternoon.

Mittmen Meet

Varsity and freshman boxing award
winners will report to the Oil and
Gas Building at 4 o'clock Friday after-
noon. According to Jack Schricker,
boxing coach, it is planned to elect a
captain and a manager at the meeting,
All managers and assistant managers
are asked to be present also. Motion
pictures of the Culver-Pitt frosh bouts
will be shown.

Wood Scores Twice On Long Runs
For “Blues;” Goldberg Shines

Dr. Sutherland’s “Blues” exhibited
healthy comeback power in the third
regular practice game of the spring
training session Saturday by scoring
three touchdowns and a ﬁeld goal to
overcome an early six-point lead of
the “Yellows” eleven and win, 23-6.

Marshall Goldberg sprung a sur-
prise on the “Blues” on the second
play of the game when he raced
through the entire team to chalk up
the ﬁrst score with a 60-yard run. The
effect of this uprising was soon to be
seen, as the “Blues” smashed down
the ﬁeld in one sustained drive to
score when Stapulis sneaked 20 yards
down the left sidelines for the ﬁrst
touchdown. Souchak’s perfect place-
ment with La Rue holding the ball
put the “Blues” in the lead.

Then, with only seconds to go in
the half, Souchak again stepped back
from his position at right end, and
calmly lifted the ball through the up-
rights 30-yards away to make it 10-6
as the half ended.

Neither eleven scored again until
substitutions were made for both
teams. With Snake Wood at one of
the halfbacks in the “Blues” back-
ﬁeld. the ball started moving goal-
ward. “Snake” scored twice in quick
succession, one on a 60-yard run, the
other for almost 45-yards.

Wood's Runs Feature

Wood's ﬁrst touchdown run started
from punt formation. The pass from
center was bad, and by the time the
kicker could recover, the opposing
linemen were closing in fast. “Snake,”
realizing his kick would be blocked,
dodged several tacklers, reversed his
ﬁeld and sped the remaining 20 yards,
far in front of the secondary pur-
suers.

This game was perhaps the most
hard-fought of the trio of practice con-
tests. Defensively, the squad has im-
proved, and in spots, the offense
threatened to go places after a little
more polish has been acquired.

Bill Glassford and the two tackles,
Tony Matisi and George Delich, have
been showing consistency in the for-
ward wall. Johnny Urban and Leo
Malarkey have been sharing one half-
back post, with Bob La Rue and
"Cur1y” Stebbins shifting about at
the other.
the fullback post for the past week.

According to a recent announce-
ment. the annual All-Star alumni game
will be played May 9.

Feely Releases Intramural
Basketball League Standings

 

Five Cage Teams Wind Up Season Showing Undefeated
Records; 27 Outﬁts Finish Schedules‘

 

By Leonard Levison
Standings in the ﬁve Intramural basketball leagues have recent-
ly been released by Martin J. Feely, director of Intramural athletics.
According to these rechecked ﬁgures, six teams are holding the top
positions in the ﬁve leagues and eight have qualiﬁed for the cham-
pionship play-oﬁs, qualiﬁcation requirement being a ﬁrst or second

place.

Spotless records were made by the Chem Engineers, the Little

Potatoes, Kappa Sigma, and Phi Delta:

Theta. In fact every league winner
was undefeated in league competition,
with the exception of the Sophties
and Newman Club, sharers of the In-
dependent League title. They had
one defeat each.

Qualiﬁers in Fraternity League A
were Kappa Sigma and Phi Kappa.
Second in the league standings, Phi
Kappa’s only setback was administer-
ed by the Kappa Sigma wrecking
crew.

VVl1i1e Phi Delta Theta wa.s winning
the League B title rather handily, sec-
ond place was a toss-up between Pi
Kappa Alpha and Delta Tau Delta,
each having three victories .and two
losses. In the deciding match, as a
preliminary to the play-offs, PiKA

vincing: manner.

Engineering prizes were won by
the Chem Engineers, undefeated ﬁrst-

Golfers Tee Off!
With Tech Today

Open Season At Chartiers Heights;
Three Newcomers Will Start

 

Tee for twelve is" the order ‘of the
day this afternoon when the Panther
putters start swinging clubheads
against the Carnegie Tech clansmen
at the Chartiers Heights course in the
golfing inaugural.

Although ﬁve members of the Pitt
sextet are deﬁnitely certain that they
will be at the ﬁrst tee today, the
sixth man has not been chosen yet.
The ﬁrst ﬁve include Pat Symonds,
Frank Souchak, John \Vasco, Bob
Mease, and Sam Musico.

Symonds, a prodigous hitter, will be
the Panther number one man.

Next in line is Frank Souchak,
sophomore footballer, whose game,
like that of Symonds, is featured by
tremendous drives. Souchak played
as a freshman last year while the year
before that he won the state scholas-
tic championship.

Number three position will be ﬁlled
by the capable Johnny Wasco.

Bob Mease was in the sixth posi-
tion last year and has moved up two
notches this season. Track satellite
Sam Musico is a newcomer to the
Panther golfing ranks.

Rivals In Contest

“Bluebeard” Stars In Winning
Interfraternity Sing Skit

 

Just as methodically as Bluebeard
beheaded his Wives, Kappa Kappa
Gamma killed the cup-winning hopes
of other women's fraternities at the
annual Interfraternity Sing, Monday
evening.

In a fast-moving skit entitled
“B1uebeard Finds Happiness in Pan-
hellenic,” that story-book rascal pa-
raded wives representing other wo-
men’s fraternities, hustled them be-
hind a screen, and following a blood-
curdling scream, emerged each time
with a. crepe-paper-haired balloon head
to tack it on the wall. The last wife
to arrive was the “Kappa Girl” and
virtually everyone lived happily ever
after.

IRunning close competition to the
winners were the Delta Delta Delta
ma.mmy skit, the Zeta Tau Alpha scale
and notes, the Kappa Alpha Theta
