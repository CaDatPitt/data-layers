BY CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

A 25-year-old Pitt cafeteria
worker was arrested and charged
with rape by campus police ofﬁcers
last night, after allegedly assaulting
a Pitt Tower C resident in her room
last night.

Police said Rodrick Lear, a Pitt
employe, was arrested in a Tower C
restroom after the victim escaped
and called Pitt police from a nearby
room.

Concert
Funding
Slashed

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Student Government Board
voted unanimously to accept a
proposal limiting concert alloca-
tions to $13,000 at a meeting
Wednesday in the Student Union

2 Lower Lounge.

“The proposal will keep ticket-

_ costs down and permit smaller,

more effective shows,” said SGB
member Josh Baylson.
‘‘I think it’s good because that

‘way we’re not losing money by,

contracting more expenses than
returns,” Programming member
Becky Gibbs said. “We won’t be
able to get super big name acts, but
we’ll still be able to get decent
acts.”

A prime example of losses taken
by the Programming Committee,
according to Programming member
Andy Coleman, is the recent Dave
Mason concert, which cost $22,000.
Ticket prices were $4_per person
with approximately 2,200 in atten-
dance. ' '

The revenue generated was in the
area of eight to nine thousand
dollars, Coleman said, with a net
cost of $14,000 falling to the
committee. .

“We are allocated $86,000. We
have one of the top ﬁve college
programming budgets across the
country. We do lose an awful lot of
money and would like to get away
from that,” Coleman said.

Gibbs said for the most part, the
Programming Committee agreed
with the proposal prior to its
submission to the Board. “It just
seemed ridiculous to spend so much

money,” Gibbs said.

The Board also accepted a
proposal to prohibit the‘ use of
student activities fees for purchas-
ing religious and politically ideo-
logical publications from ,off-cam-
pus distributors’, on the grounds
that if astudent were interested in

- such topics, he could be-referred to
S vrésiat

      

  

no expense. ‘ g

   
   

The victim was treated and
released at Magee Women’s Hos-.
pital, police said.

Police reported the victim was
studying in her room at approxi-
mately 8 p.m. last night when Lear
allegedly knocked on her door.
When the victim said, “Come in,”
police said, Lear entered the room
and, when told to leave, drew a
knife. He then allegedly held the
knife against the victim’s throat and
raped her.

After the attack, police said, the

‘ student escaped to a friend’s room

and called campus police.

Two Tower C residents said they
saw stockinged feet in a restroom on
a ﬂoor different than that of the
alleged attack, and notiﬁed campus
police who arrested Lear at 8:30
p.m. and took him to Oakland No. 4
police ‘station. ‘

He then was transferred to No. 1

police station, downtown.

Posvar Argues Pitt Case

BY BILL MOORE

HARRISBURG—Chancellor Wes-

ley Posv_ar took his appeal for an
additional $7.6 million in State
funding t the House Appropriations
Committee here Wednesday, meet-
ing hostility from some of the legis-
.la_tors. . ’

Posvar, along with Pitt’s vice-

chancellors, medical dean Gerhard

Werner and Student Government
Board president Bernie Payne,
spoke with the committee members
for over one hour on subjects
ranging from University tuition to

money spent on the Sharon Johnson ,

sex discrimination suit.

Delivering a short address similar
to one he gave last week before the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
Posvar complained the University
could not continue to maintain its
current educational quality without
either a substantially increased
state appropriation or a drastic
tuition hike. ’

“We return more in the way of
service and bringing money back to
thetstate than any other way money
can be invested,” Posvar said. He
asked the legislators, to overrule
Governor Milton Shapp’s sug-
gestion of a $61 million state
appropriation and bring the ﬁgure
more in line with the $69 million
requested.

He said Pitt receives only 34
percent of its educating expenses
from the state, while similar
institutions in New York, Virginia, -

and Michigan receive over 50

percent.

_ ._Y.-’.—Appealing' » to I the legislative,
  fcotmnittea'notfto,'foxc¢:x¢t;an6tmm

tuition hike on Pitt students, Payne
said he was forced to take one year
off from school because of a lack of
money and is currently carrying

. large loans. “Unfortunately,” the
"student representative said, “my
case is the rule and not the
exception. ’ ’

Payne also argued that insuf-
ﬁcient funding would mean in-
creased class size, cutbacks in
student services and an eventual
drop «in the quality hf faculty.

Posvar followed Payne's speech
by pointing out the decline in the
number of students from families in

the median-income range attending '

Pitt. . 

Werner spoke brieﬂy to the
legislators about attempts by the
medical school to steer its
graduates into primary care work
and practice in rural areas most in
need of medical care.

Rep. Thomas J. Fee, of Lawrence
County, was openly hostile in
questioning Posvar. Fee ﬁrst
criticized Pitt for allegedly refusing
to participate in a State Department
of Education study on post-gradu-
ate employment of Pitt" students,
but Posvar contended Pitt had not
been contacted.

- Fee then cited literature distri-
buted by Pitt biochemist Sharon
Johnson, currently suing the
University over her claim she was
denied tenure on the basis of sex.
Fee said he had been told Pitt had
spent close to $900,000 in legal fees
‘ﬁghting Johnson in. court.

“The assertions -that have been

He put the figure closer to
$100,000 over the past ﬁve years.

. “I think that is totally defensible,” '

Posvar said, adding Pitt had
attempted to settle the matter prior
to litigation.

Mayoralty
Candidate

1 Visits Pitt

BY RANDY GAYSEK‘

Pittsburgh's biggest problem is
the small family drain that has
plagued the city for 27 years,
according to Democratic mayoral
candidate Frank Lucchino during at

2 I» press conference at Pitt Tuesday.
 « “If we can solve problems of ,
“ public safety, housing and jobs as

they relate to young families, we
can solve them for all citizens of

° Pittsburgh,” Lucchino, who is in his

ﬁrst term as a city councilman, said.
Lucchino said he would actively
promote the advantages of the

A various neighborhoods to attract

younger families.

“I think we have to sell
Pittsburgh the same way people sell
refrigerators and margarine,” he
said, phinting out the city’s
advantages such as the great
municipal park system, the fine
museums and the zoo as prime
selling factors.

He cited the Mission Street area

of the Southside, Perrysville
Avenue, Troy Hill, Polish Hill and
West End as attractive for their
proximity to the downtown business
area.
‘ “You know you can live in West
End and be in downtown Pittsburgh
in about three and a half minutes, ”
Lucchino said.

Lucchino promised he would
spend the money allocated for
various programs on the projects for
which they are intended.

ROTC Accreditation
Finds New Support

BY PETE DICKS

Accreditation for ROTC
cdurses received a boost when the
Student Government Board voted
Wednesday to recommend the
reestablishment of credit for
September 1977 to the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

The vote was strongly influenced
by Air Force ROTC member Jim
Painter’s presentation of petitions
containing 2,446 signatures of
students in favor of granting
College of Arts and Sciences credit
for ROTC courses. ROTC lost its
CAS accreditation on December 3,
1968.

SGB will submit the petitions to
the FAS committee on ROTC,
recommending accreditation be
approved no later than April 30 so
reinstitution of credit can begin by
the fall term.

ROTC course credit would count
as part of the 12 non-CAS limitation
allowed__the school's students. f

form a countermovement. The
absence of this movement indicates
the students do not seem to oppose.
this,” SGB member Joanne Levison
said.

Levison added SGB is g“apol-
itical” and, therefore, considers its
support for ROTC accreditation a
question of representing the wishes’
of the Pitt student body rather than
taking sides on a political issue.

Young Socialist Alliance pres-
ident Rich Gollub, who opposed the
accreditation proposal, said,
“ROTC students just started this
thing rolling again in the last week
or so. There was a movement
against this two years ago and if we
gave it a little time to develop, I
think you’d see that opposition here
again.’-’ _

Gollub said he feels ROTC
accreditation indirectly would
encourage U.S. military involve-
ment in other countries.

Speaks

“City council has provided
sufﬁcient funds for the administra-
tion to carry forward certain
programs and that money has not
been spent. I’m not «in favor of
reckless spending, but I am in favor
of spending money to provide
programs we have promised,” he
said.

One example of past failure in
this area is the Neighborhood
Housing program, which was
supposed to provide 350 homes but,
according to Lucchino, only 52 have
been built in the past three years.

“Once you make a decision that
this is a program you want to do and
you tell the people of Pittsburgh
that you’re going to do it, then by
God, do it,” he said.

To Catch the Theives

The number of thefts occurring at Trees Hall is a drastic
problem; therefore, it requires a drastic solution. Seventeen
percent of campus thefts occur there and the ones in the men’s
locker room are not of the careless-student-leaving-locker-
unlocked variety. Instead, persons have been getting into lockers
by breaking padlocks with boltcutters.

‘This isn’t the type of crime that will disappear via community
education seminars; authorities must try to apprehend the criminals
as quickly as possible. .

So one can understand why the campus police are cracking down
on non-student access to Trees Hall. The police have the evidence
to. believe that non-students are carrying out the thefts. It follows
that until this problem is solved, Trees Hall visitors must be
restricted to students.

One effective way to do this is to check the Pitt IDs of persons
entering and leaving the building. This method is not foolproof;
non-students may still sneak past the desk.

It cannot be assumed that all non-students sneak into Trees Hall
to commit a crime. The best exercise and recreational facilities for
miles around can be found there.

But when one of these crimes is committed, and police search the
area for non-students, these people must face the consequences.
During the current crime wave this means they must face a $35
-fine for trespassing.

The campus police definition of a non-student is anyone without
a Pitt ID. Unfortunately, careless students also belong to this
category. They, too, face the fine for trespassing. This is unfair; to
fine them makes absent-mindedness a crime.

There is a simple solution to this, one that does not interfere with
the crackdown on non-student trespassers. All the authorities need
do is give students who have forgotten identification the
opportunity to verify themselves as Pitt students. All those found
without ID should receive a citation. But Pitt students should be
allowed the opportunity to show the magistrate a Pitt ID and prove
they were not trespassing, thereby avoiding an expensive fine.

Q/6'7‘/47/\/.Aﬂ7"

BY CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Most Americans have taken up
the habit of, without thinking,
committing an assault against our
language that has grown so
common as to force many literate
authorities to throw up their hands
in distasteful defeat.

The offense is the increasingly
frequent misuse of “hopefully.”

This current spill is part of our
continuing effort to pollute our
speech faster than we corrupt our
environment. The task of
comparing the relative rates of ﬂow
for leaking Liberian-registered oil
and escaping “hopefullys” would
be both monumentous and depres-_

 Three Sides to Every Story  

go to the source. For credibility’s
sake this source should not be a
friend, follower or admirer.

Take the concept of affinity, for
example. Most people have
questionned a person's concern or
lack of concern for them at one time
or another. This becomes a source
of anxiety and discomfort that is
often projected to this other person,
a convenient scapegoat. Friction
between the two parties escalates
because neither examines the
other’s side of the triangle, for a
variety of reasons. They usually do
not want to hear the other side
because it conflicts with their own

BY ROSCOE DANDY

When people advocate their side
of a story they often fail to recognize
the fact that there are three sides to
a story and thus deny credibility to
the opposition. This three-sided
triangle includes the advocates
side, his opponents side and the
rarely known side
based on data,
circumstances
and motives. The
desire for quick,

soothing to the
mind and sub-

stantiating one’s position, prevents
a stable triangle formation. People
innocently say, ‘I'm certain it is so

-because 1 know it happened this
way.

person's opinion. There is no
balance in this approach and the
angrier one side becomes, the
angrier the other party becomes and
the less balanced this triangle of .
interacting opinion is.

THE OTHER SIDE

Everybody has an opinion, take
professors as an example. They
have the task of grading examina-
tions. It is a job that can make or
break a student's chance for
graduation, graduate school or
professional career. The basic issue
in this matter is what the professors
want. Since many of them are not
forward enough to state exactly
what they will evaluate, a student is
forced to employ ingenuity and

lguess which way the grading will

This is a stiﬂing information
system that impedes intellectual
exchange. The student has his
story, the professor his story, yet
only the professor has the score
sheet. The triangle remains
unbalanced because the professors
side has priority; the student has no
recourse but to compromise his
ideas and support what the
professor wants to hear.

Break the Habit- Hopefully

sing to one who values the language
and the oceans.

Incorrectly used “hopefullys”
are not only prevalent in our
everyday speech; more and more,
the ‘adverb can be found in our
newspapers and magazines.
Journalists, whose livelihood con-
sists of properly employing the
language, have-begun to be swept
away by the swelling tide of what
“sounds right.”  .  _ A

And a growing tide it .is'._~"".T_l1e
word has been so torturously
abused that a majority of language
experts polled by word-worshipping
couple William and Mary Morris
agreed to overlook the grammatical
inconsistency and accept A “hope-
fully” in spoken English. Fewer,
though a substantial number, would
even pass by an ill-used “hope-
fully” in writing. Some, incredibly,

would accept the grammatical error V

in formal writing.

This comes from persons who
should know better; in all probabil-
ity they do, and cast their ballots
with a sense of resignation. Let’s
hope so.

But, given this information, there
is little’ hope that more than a
handful of our general population
realizes the wrong being inflicted
against our manner of communica-
tion.

It is hard to lobby successfully
against such a commonly accepted
habit; in fact, it sometimes is too

If the stories

come is an ex-
change of hot air
full of two-sided
distortions that
allow little chance

for reconciliation.

much even to insulate yourself from
the decay around you. It is for this
reason the error can be understood.
It is no longer the fault of the person
who lets.slip a “hopefully.”

But that does not ‘make it

something to accept. The battle

must be fought. The acceptance of _

misused “hopefullys” sets a
dangerous precedent. I have tried
not to use a misplaced “hopefully”
in professional writing. No major or
momentous feat, but, I thought, the
least I could do. As it turned out, it
may have been the most I could do.

Recently, I employed the same

language" principle that brought us
“hopefully.” I misused the word
“happily,” as in, “Happily, Idi
Amin will not live forever.” But as
much as I regret the error—and a
substantial one it was—I am glad it
occurred because it serves’ to
illustrate my point.
. Should we allow misplaced
“hopefullys” to become a part of
accepted written and spoken
language, we are opening a
Pandora’s dictionary that won’t be
shut.

Edwin Newman captured a
special place in my style book when
he led what has been a successful
campaign against “viable” things,
especially alternatives. Maybe a
few sure-to-be well-chosen words
from the literate newsman will do
the trick on “hopefully.”

It is to be hoped.

UGE Tells How Union
VVIII Beneﬁt Everyone

In its March 9 editorial the Pitt
News asked: “How would graduate
employe unionization affect educa-
tion at Pitt?” The Union of
Graduate Employes (UGE) believes
that unionization of Teaching
Assistants (TA's), Teaching Fel-
lows (TF’s), Graduate Student
Assistants (GSAfs) ‘and Graduate
Student Researchers (GSR’s) will
signiﬁcantly improve the quality of
education here. _

We deﬁne ‘ ‘quality of education’ ’
quite speciﬁcally. We think it
means good teachers teaching
smaller classes that meet students‘
needs. It means having access to
well-stocked libraries and labora-
tories. And it most certainly means
lower tuition. All students want
these things. Yet it is important to
transform desire into reality.
Unionization can begin to do just
this.

UGE believes that graduate
employe working conditions .are
intimately linked’ with .undergrad-

. uates’ learning environment... If one V

is poor, the other will be, too. We
want to negotiate a collective
bargaining contract which gives
high priority to the improvement of
both. _
. Such a contract would limit class
size, provide teacher training and
give teachers the control over
curriculum they need to maintain
quality of education. It would also
seek more funds for library
resources and lab equipment. And
through its access to American
Federation of Teacher and AF L-CIO
‘representatives in Harrisburg, UGE
will ﬁght for the increased funding
which Pitt needs to make these
changes possible.
Quality of education also involves
improvement in the standard of
-living and working conditions of
graduate employes. Classes cannot
be very good if they are taught by
poorly-paid teachers who are often
forced to take second jobsto pay
their bills. To improve the quality of
education, UGE will fight for a

Student Signers
Walking through the Student
Union, I was stopped by two men
requesting my signature on a
petition. Instead of presenting their
opinion of why ROTC should be
accredited, they led me to believe
they were personally denied college

credit for courses taken previous to
entering the Vietnam War.

, Because of this blatant misrepres-

entation of the issue, I agreed to
sign the petition. I feel my
ignorance of the controversy over
ROTC was exploited and I resent

the fact that I was used.
ROTC provides military training
to students so they may participate
in U.S. military institutions. Since I
do not support the imperialist
practices of these institutions, I do
not support their efforts to
brainwash students while in school.
School is supposedly an opportunity
to receive intellectual stimulation
and growth. I feel ROTC can only
stunt this growth, since it
encourages a subjective, militaristic
view of the world situation. There
are enough courses offered at Pitt
that accomplish this task and Ifail to
see the necessity of a program
devoted entirely to promoting these
ideologies. The replacement of

and GSR’s. We will also ﬁght for
genuine job security, adequate
ofﬁce space and lab facilities,
improved health insurance and a
means to resolve our grievances
promptly.

These improvements need not
involve an increase in tuition.
Instead the administration can
re-order its priorities. Let us be
speciﬁc. It would cost just ‘56
percent of the .University’s 1976
operating budget, or about $1
million, to give each of Pitt’s 1,000
graduate employes a well-deserved
$1,000 per year salary increase. Yet

staff unionization. And these are
just two examples of how priorities
could be reordered to release the
funds necessary to improve grad-
uate employe working conditions.
Moreover, these improvements
can be made peacefully. UGE has

pursued its goals in a .democratic, .

manner. We have consistently tried
to educate the University commun-
ity of the problems of graduate
employes. V

ROTC with a program that actually
serves the needs of the students
would be a refreshing change.
Therefore, I deleted my signature

anyone considering signing a

implications of what ROTC really

Women Coaches
Not Treated Equal

Last week an announcement
came out of the athletic department
at Pitt that would have caused
repercussions of crisis proportions
all over the University had it not
involved women’s athletics.

Two coaches were ﬁred. The
announcement came as simply as I
have written it, with no further
explanation. And now it seems as if
everyone at Pitt is going to accept if
just as easily. This lack of concern
might be better understood if it
were the ﬁrst time this has
happened, but this is the second
time in less than ﬁve years that two
women’s basketball coaches have
been ﬁred at the end of successful
seasons that had every promise of
more and better to come.

Granted, the Pitt News ran an
article on the incident, but it
maintained a purely academic
interest in the real issue. The article
dealt more with the instability
inherent in a coaching job rather
than bothering to question the
arbitrary decisions that sent Condo
and Wallace job hunting. The
article spent more time discussing
hockey than it spent on evaluating.
Pitt’s women’s basketball program.

But women’s basketball at Pitt IS
the issue! Do people think that
continuous arbitrary changes don’t
have an effect on the team or the

athletic program? Pitt lost one of its
greatest all-time players when
Debbie Jones transferred to Mary-
land. To make an analogy, consider
the football team. When Johnny
Majors announced he wouldn't be
returning next season, the news-
papers were bursting with contro-
versy: “Will Majors’ decision
affect the play of the team in the
Sugar Bowl?” Well, do these same
people think that the arbitrary ﬁring
of two competent coaches won’t
affect the way the basketball team
plays? Think again.

I don’t know Ms. Wallace
personally, but, having attended a
basketball camp here at Pitt run by
former coaches Condo and Kas-
nevich, I can testify to their great
coaching abilities and their abilities
to establish rapport with the
players. Yet they're gone, and now
two more with them, and hardly a
ripple caused in or out of the
University community. Don’t you
think it’s about time to start asking
questions when imperious decisions
like the firing of »two—no,
four—-competent, winning coaches
are made? Don’t you think that
Sandy Bullman and Casimir Mys-
linski should be made to account for
their actions? I think this is vital to
the future of both women’s and
men’s athletics at Pitt.

Three Sides 1 A
To Every
Story

(Continued from Page 4)

THE SIDE NEVER KNOWN

The side never known is an
elusive side with hard to pinpoint

circumstances and motives. It is
here that arguments become sound
or week. Since people view disputes
with arguments, controversies and
confrontations as not being con-
structive avenues of change, they
use these avenues to incite their
opposition.

This leads to friction between
people trying to guess what each

other intends from their own small ‘ .

frames of reference. The entire
triangle becomes weak and nothing
constructive evolves.

The basic reason people have no
sound explanations for their side of
a story is that their methods of
investigation are poor. Rather than
go to the source directly, they seek
comfort and collaboration in a
friend’s viewpoints. The friend,
sometimes unreliable, helps bury
the side never known and conﬁrm’s
people's hallowness in judgement.‘

Players Respond to Creeks

Tom Bizoza

Early Monday afternoon, I
observed the March 14 issue of The
Pitt News. After I was through
looking at all the pictures, someone
called my attention to a column in
the “Letters to the Editor” section.
The caption read: GREEKS
CHARGE FOOTBALL INSULT. I
decided to struggle through the rest
of the article. Maybe it’s my
stupidity (after all, I am a football
player), but after reading the
column, I can honestly say I was
confused. There was a sentence

that said the “illustrious national’

champions” displayed a banner.
For the past three years, my
coaches have told me that I as a
member of the team, so, am I wrong
to also consider myself one of the
National Champions? -Theltrouble
is, I don’t remember displaying any
banner, or even being told to
display one, yet I read that the
National Champions are writing
that Greeks eat shit. They might, I
don’t know, but I do know that
myself and at least 120 other
football players had no part in
displaying any banners.
Then, I read about the ‘ ‘silliness’ ’
that the coaches pleaded with the
fraternities ‘and sororities. The
coaches pleaded support from the
whole student body. The number
one team in the nation couldn’t sell
out its home games. In anybig
business (college football is big
business), you have to sell your
product to the public and the public
must buy it in order for you to
maintain business. This is what the
coaches were doing.
I got the impression from the
article that the people who wrote it
think that there is tribute due to

Greeks something for coming to the
games. Thanks, but no thanks.
“Who attends games through rain
and snow...?” they ask. Well, I do,
and I don’t want to be out in the rain
or snow anymore than the next guy.
Football may be a spectator sport,
but I play for a few spectators—my
family and friends—not the Greeks.
I don’t feel like a fool as the

column may suggest. The real fools_

are the fools who wrote the letter. I
don’t know how it was intended, but
when I saw the banner, I thought it
was funny, a sarcastic jab at the
Greek system (a system that I have
very little respect for and even less
respect for now). In my opinion, the
“silly” things that people, do at
games are far less stupid and idiotic
than the “silly” things fraternities
do. Fraternities talk of the concept
of brotherhood. They “strengthen’ ’

Boards for giving me a bad case of
insomnia, I’ve really lost 3 1°‘ °f
sleep since reading your article.
Secondly, Iwould like to request an
apology to the entire football team
and coaching staff,’ save myself. It
was my idea to make the sign in
regard to Greek Week; naturally, it
was made in jest. But if you are to
take it seriously and show your
insecurity in our organization then
you will receive no apology or pity
from me. I thank you for your
support and I’m sure it played a big
part in giving Pitt (National
Champs) an average attendance of
40,000 in a stadium that holds close
to 60,000. Also I would like to thank
you for not mentioning my whole
name; even though there are only
two Matts on the team, it was a
decent gesture. If it isn’t the entire

BY REGINA RATTIGAN

Registration can be contrasted
with and compared to a pair of dirty.
socks.

Unlike somebody’s dirty socks,
the registration process is changed
every once in a while. Like
somebody’s dirty socks, fall term
registration has been around along
time and few people remember
what it used to be like years ago.

“Contact somebody older than
God,” advised Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs Alfred Moye, when
asked of the registration’s history.

Where could somebody like that
be found? Maybe an alumnus
would be close enough.

At the Office of Development and
Alumni Affairs, an unsmiling
receptionist said there was nobody
there who could answer questions
about the history of registration.
She said information may be found
in A one A of the offices on the
Cathedral’ s ground ﬂoor.

G-17 has nothing to do with the
history of registration. But the
people "at the Registration Office
can answer all kinds of questions

about the current registration
period.

According to administrative aid
Jolene Owens and supervisor of the
Registration Office Madeline
Greenlee, registration started Mon-
day ‘for students who will have
accumlated 90 credits or more by
the end of the current term.
Students with 60 or more credits are
allowed to register on Thursday.
Students with 30 or more credits can
start registering March 21. Fall
term registration ends Sept. 6.

“Students should read the time
schedule carefully,” Owens said.

“It’s important for students to
copy correct informationgsuch as
the alpha codes,” Greenlee said.
“They should also check them on
the class schedule card they’ll
receive in the‘-mail after registra-
tion.’.’

Doesn’t anybody live in the past
these days? Doesn’t anybody keep
ﬁles? A piece of Pitt history was
missing. This case should be taken
to none other than the Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences Robert
Marshall. His attention must he
demanded.

But demanding can’t be done
here between noon and 1 p.m.
That’s when the group in the Dean’s
ofﬁce goes to eat stuff like hoagies
and Swiss steak.

The office of Director of
Freshman Advising Linda Burns

was just down the hall from the.

vacant Dean’s ofﬁce. Maybe
advisors had some knowledge of the
history. ‘
“Students should take time when
they plan their new course

(r -.'\r <,

~ ‘Ffiday,{M§ff"c'h ‘rs;-*,‘*1=a“7

schedules,” Burns said. “They
should be sure to check out new
courses that aren’t in the course
description.’ ’

This wasn’t working out right.
But now sardine sandwich hour was
over, the Dean’s staff was back and
a bit of the history was uncovered.

Assistant to the Dean Rhea Bass
is nowhere near God's age but she
has been at Pitt for 17 years.

CAS didn't always have stag-
gered registration for students with

different numbers of accumulated
credits.
“I can only speak for CAS

.registration,” Bass said. “Around
.1965, Student Government com-

plained that seniors should be
allowed to register ﬁrst, juniors
next and so on. It was only fair.”

Registration wasn’t always done
in G-17.

“Students registered directly
with advisors around 1960,” Bass
said. “The registrations were
collected in the Dean’s ofﬁceand
sent to the Office of the Registrar.

“Before 1960, I understand they
had something call ‘arena registra-
tion’,” Bass continued. “All the
course cards were in the Syria
Mosque. Students ran around
choosing their courses by picking up
the cards which are now kept in
G-17.”

So when you register, wear dirty
socks or carry them with you. Not
only are they symbolic of registra-
tion but they’ll make the line move
faster.

“Ours _is not the business of
putting out forest fires. Ours is the
business of planting trees,_”
Chancellor Wesley Posvar declared
yesterday at the Honors Convoca-
tion ceremony in Carnegie Music
Hall.

Chancellor Posvar’s statement
was in reference to society’s
expectations of higher educational
institutions. A

The ceremony, honoring 19
juniors and seniors representing the
top two percent of QPAs, 100
special academic awards for
graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents and 25 awards of distinction
for the faculty. I

The guest of honor, Dr. Baruch S.
Blumberg, 1976 Nobel Prize winner
in medicine, was presented a
Doctorate of Sciences by College of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg. Blumberg received the
hood indicating his level ‘of
distinction for his work in genetic
transmission of infectious disease.

Blumberg, who holds a doctorate
in medicine and anthropology,
spoke to the honors students, their
parents, faculty, over 300 area high
school scholars and a smattering of

' interested students.

Speaking in response to the
awards bestowed upon the groups
they represented were: Lisa

  Diggers High on the Tusk

BY PAMELA EUSI

Pitt’s anthropology depart-
ment is hunting for pigs these day.
Yes, that’s right, pigs, but not just
any old pigs. This wanted specimen
happens to be the ﬂat-headed
peccary.

This wanted specimen happens to
be the ﬂat-headed peccary.

. 'It seems the word is out that
the prehistoric man of southwestern
Pennsylvania was making his meals
14,000 years ago from the
ﬂat-headed peccary. This fact has
just been established by Pitt as one
of the few associations of an extinct

A Ice Age animal with well docu-

mented human occupation in the
eastern United States.

Fossil remains of this beast were
recovered last summer from
excavations by the Pitt archaeol-
ogists at the Meadowcroft rockshel-
ter site near Avella, Pa. The lower
tusk of the animal, which has been
‘extinct for at least 10,000 years, was
unearthed in a deeply stratified
portion of the excavation from the
lens of a ﬁrepit that has been
radiocarbon dated at about 14,225
BC. The radiocarbon tests were
conducted at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C.

John ‘E. Guilday, associate
curator V of vertebrate fossils at
Carnegie Museum of Natural
History, identiﬁed the ﬁnd when
the fauna remains were brought to
his home laboratory to be analyzed.

The gspecimen in question is a
broken lower tusk of a young adult
peccary. During the Ice Age, the
flat-headed peccary roamed
throughout the entire United States
in herds of 20 or more. It was about
two and a half times larger than its
distant relative of today, the

javelina (genus name) or wild pig,
which roams the southwest United
States.

The living floor (occupation
surface) on which the fossil was
found contains the ﬁre pit whose
contents contained charred animals
fossils, charred vegetable matter,
stone tools and chips from stone
tools on the living ﬂoor.

James Adovasio, associate pro-
fessor of anthropology at Pitt and
director of the Meadowcroft project
said, “This is a long-awaited event.
Archaeologists have long been
searching for the association of any

extinct Ice Age animal—mammoth,
sloth, peccary or whatever—w1tn

well-documented human occupa-
tion in the East. That's. what we
ﬁnally have here. The peccary fossil
was found in an area replete with
human artifacts under excellent
stratigraphic and radiocarbon con-
trols.”

According to Adovasio, although
there is no direct evidence that the
animal was scavenged or hunted
and then brought to the rockshelter
for use, this is the most likely
assumption scientists can make.

Mouth Organ Musi :
Playing it by Tongue

BY RANDY GAYSEK

Some people can’t sing, can’t
read music and couldn’t carry a tune
in a bathtub, which might be why so
many people sing in the shower.
There are some people around who
are so tone deaf, Heinz could make
cans from their ears, but who still
feel a need to create music in a more
personal way than tuning in the FM
or spinning the discs at home.

Instead of reverting or resigning

themselves to something as primi-
tive as popping their ﬁngers or
tapping their toes, they should
consider the harmonica.

Certainly there are many skeptics
who will say that harmonicas are not
truly musical instruments. Admit-
tedly, you don’t see them featured
regularly at the Boston Pops, but
harmonicas are nonetheless bona
fide tools of melody making.

Harmonicas are small

Bad Tactics; Good Music

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

“It’s not my job to keep the
aisles clear,” said Rex’s springy
lead vocalist and Mick Jagger
look-alike, Rex Smith. ‘‘I’m up
onstage to drive the kids nuts and
out of their seats.”

The kids did go nuts but Rex and

company were nearly prohibited’

from finishing their set Tuesday
night at the Stanley Theater where
they preceeded Bob‘ Seger and the
Silver Bullet Band.

Through Rex’s first three songs,
“Trouble,” “Ten Seconds of Love”
and “Feeling Better,” the audience
was quietly sitting in their seats,
causing little disturbance.

But as the band broke into
“Runnin’ Wild,” the fans did
exactly that. People in the back of
the theater started to storm toward
the empty orchestra pit with
Smith’s encouragement. “We’re
gonna do whatever we bleepin’
want tonight, don’t let those
security people sit you down,”

Smith said.

Ushers started to contain the
people, trying to eject them from
the orchestra pit. Fights broke out
and if Fire Capt. Norman Sanner
hadn’t stepped onstage to stop the
show, a full-fledged riot was just
seconds from happening.

“When I'm onstage, that’s my
show,” said the cocky Smith. “I
don’t have any hard feelings toward
the guy stopping it, but it's not my
job to know the rules of the place I’m
playing.”

What Smith in his youthful
enthusiasm didn't realize is calling
people from the back of the hall to
the stage front is the worst thing to
do at a concert using reserved
seating, especially since the aisles
of the Stanley are small and become
congested easily.

Rex, however, may have realized
that calculated cheerleading tactics
were the only way to make up for the
band’s musical shortcomings.

Smith was noteworthy for his
powerful voice and lewd prancing,

while drummer Mike Ratti was

band from New York City had little
to offer.

The band’s guitarists showed
nothing better than basic chords; all
the songs were earsplitting, ele-
mentary hard rock jams ﬁlled with
juvenile lyrics.

When headliners Bob Seger and
the Silver Bullet Band finally took
the stage, the crowd had cooled
down considerably.

Seger, 31, a 10-year rock veteran,
is capable of using the words “rock
’n’ roll” in a song and sounding
wise, well and ‘wonderful, rather
than appearing as a-pretender like
Smith.

Quateman’s Album

Plays Electric Style

BY JIM FARERI

Night After Night
Blll Quateman
RCA APL-2027

The legacy of Bill Quateman
illustrates the serious consequences
that can come from hassles with
record companies. Quateman’s
first recording had to sustain his
reputation for three years. Now, on
a different label, Quateman is
starting anew.

But “Night ‘After Night” is not
the work of a beginner: Quateman’s
three year “vacation” was spent in
progressing from an acoustic to an
electric style—and without coming
off as a ﬁsh out of water.

In fact, “Night After Night” is an

exceptional album. Quateman has

enlisted seasoned musicians, dis-
covered a producer with new ideas
and developed a fresh funky rock
sound.

Among the notables are Elton
John's guitarist Caleb Quaye and
ex-Wings drummer Denny Seiwell.
Undoubtedly, these two rock
-spotlighters influenced the direc-
tion of “Night After Night,”
especially Quaye, whose guitar is as
highlighted as Quateman’s vocal.

Quateman maintains a consistent
quality from tune to tune, holding
steady to his successful loose and
jumpy rock formula; occasionally he
brings in strings or horns, or adds a

story of glass, but a rhythmic
description of what working in a
glass plant does to its workers:

“it moves, stops, and you pack, it
comes, it comes, it comes without

pause, incomes without thought, it
comes without Jesus or Marx,
it comes, it comes... ”

Oresick wrote the poem to the
regular rhythms of glass-packing.
As the poem progresses, the actual
words don’t matter——just the
inevitable, regularity of glass, the
industrial pulse, which drowns

' out words, thoughts and ‘men.

_ Oresick has lived with this pulse
all his life. He is the youngest son of
a Ukranian-American family from
Ford City’ ha. It is 'a family that has
worked for Pittsburgh Plate Glass
(PPG) for three generations.

The book is often a verbal photo
album of the family, the plant, the
town: .

“Some people call this home

because they go to Pittsburgh and

 

9| 

leave
Pittsburgh saying Pittsburgh
makes them nervous. ”

About Ford City, Oresick says:
“Your life is within that 10 square
miles.”

Within that.life, that 10 square
miles, is the omnipresent family. In-
“My Father,” he says: "

"I have always remembered him a
tired man '
I have respected him like a guest
and expected nothing...
Now in April, I want him to speak. B
I want to stand against the worn body
of his pain
I want to try it
on like a coat that does not fit. ”

And for Oresick that pain and life V

no longer “fit.” He has left Ford
City and speaks- not as an
inhabitant, but as an observer. He
is one who has left—but still loves
what he has left.

the first conscientious objector in
Armstrong County.) Peter Oresick
was released from the cycle of glass.
He was among the chosen few who
left not because he had no job, but
because he had somewhere else to
go.

This knowledge gives the poems
an edge, an unstated tension.
Oresick has worked at PPG, but he
hopes to teach after he graduates.
He calls PPG not a life, as his father
and grandfather did, but an option.

Oresick addresses his mother “in _

one poem about the change thi
option brings: -

“In your town, which is your world,
you cry
and dark falls all around you.
In my world, which is my town,
already,
I weep for my children and the dark
dissipates

’Ghost’ Album?

1977 appears to be the year of
Genesis’ revelation, at least in
Pittsburgh The area has seen a
volume of Genesis-related exper-
iences within purchasing distance
of the three rivers: first ‘ ‘Wind and
Wuthering” was released; then
Peter Gabriel’s solo album appear-

album; and by the end of the month

Seger’s vocals were gruff on the
numbers “Rock ’n’ Roll Never

and “Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man.”
He was hoarse but pretty on the

“Night Moves,” “Ship of Fools”
and “Turn the Page.”

Drew Abbot showed what a whale
of a rock guitarist he is on “Let it

player Alto Reed blew some mean
and hot licks on “Mainstreet” and
“Sunspot.” '

Robyn Robbin’s organ playing,
although not noteworthy for long
solos, was essential for shading in
the overall band sound. The rhythm
section—bassist Chris Cambell and
drummer Jamie Oldaker—was rock
steady and played without preten-
sion or unneeded frills.

The 25-year-old Oldaker,
formally with Leon Russell’s band
and currently on loan to Seger’s
band from the Eric Clapton group,
was a pleasant surprise—he joined
only three weeks ago.

Seger’s regular drummer,
Charlie Allen Martin, was hit by a
car three weeks ago in Detroit,

‘ breaking both legs and sustaining a

multitude of other internal injuries.
“This isn't going to be a full-time

' gig with Bob,” Oldaker said in his

soft’ Midwest accent. “I was
recruited so Bob could go through
with this tour, especially since he’s
doing so well now with the Night
Moves album.” .

When asked his opinion on
following a young, punky band that
nearly incited a riot, Oldaker had
this to say:

“I’ve been playing professionally

Horn '

for 12 years and have been exposed
and placed into all sorts of unique
performing situations. These guys
in front of us might be remembered
for all of the trouble they caused,
but in the long run, you have to
entertain people with music, not
cheap cheerleading tactics.”

Bob Seger and the Silver Band
did exactly that.

Irony, Rhythm in Poetry

(Continued from Page 10)

Other poems mention a larger
darkness. In “Calculus and the
Corporate State,” Oresick ob-
serves, with the same bright gaze
he gives his family and his town, the
system which holds his family and
his town.

“As you begin your study of the
corporate state, you should be
content to work. I am tempted to
say ‘good luck’ but it is not luck that
will see you through. The climb is
difficult, but when you conquer your

peak and look back, a ladder of
shoulders, arms, legs.”

It is very easy to be angry at this
corporate state, this giant glass
plant of the world. It is easy to
explode with anger and leave
nothing on the page but an
imcomprehensible bloodstain. But
this tells no one anything. Oresick
quietly controls the fire and makes a
poem. Anger fuels art. This is
where Peter Oresick astonishes.

Not that he doesn’t falter—

unwieldy, much less sure than his

other work. Their endings seem like_

hesitant pauses. But not all

photographs are equally beautiful. .

In an afterword, Pitt professor Ed
Ochester says, ‘ ‘Oresick knows that
it is not enough to tell the

truth...one has to have the ability '

to convey the emotional force of that
truth...”

Peter Oresick has both the truth
and the ability.

Reacting to ’Ghost’ Music

(Continued from Page 10)
the first two Genesis albums might
be wondering just what place
Anthony Phillips ﬁlled in the group.
Phillips was the original Genesis
guitarist and left after the
“Trespass” album, with Steve
Hackett replacing him.

Now, some six years later,
Phillips has released a “solo”
album entitled “The Geese and the
Ghost,’’ which is actually a

collaboration with guitarist Michael
Rutherford. How to describe it?
Genesis without its gusto? An
unfair statement—Phillips makes
no attempt to aim for the guts. He
reaches gently toward the mind.
Chorused12-string guitars sound
moody chords while bowed strings
set themselves in counterpoint, but
there is a discemable lack of strong
melody. Musical themes are based
on chords rather than the reverse’.

The result is pretty, but discursive
progressions.

At best, the moods evoke Tudor
England, though they aren’t really
based on the music of the time.
When they are not as impressive,
the pieces slide in circles. One can
easily fall into the circles, or fall
asleep falling into them, sleep of
relaxation, not boredom—the music
is interesting and unassuming.

Some critics have pointed out the
pretentiousness of Genesis. It is
doubtful if that epithet could be
leveled against Anthony Phillips.

Phillips’ performance is se1f-con-
scious only in the sense of being
restrained. He and Rutherford
create ethereal textures playing
together. Their arrangements
work.

The three vocal tracks might have
been eliminated. The melodies
aren’t strong enough to carry the
lyrics. They rely on the lyrics, which
are only average, to create
substance.

These are ghosts of Genesis
songs. But the singing is nice. Phil

Collins vocalizes well on “Which
Way the Wind Blows” and “God IfI
Saw Her Now.” Phillips does nicely
himself on “Collections.”

The geese have become ghosts,
the melodies that aren’t there are
haunting. Ghosts are nice—the
music is not tiring when listened
to—ultimately, only memories and
reactions are left. The dilemma is
that we witness the musician on the
cover as he plays his spirit; out of
time, deﬁned by the music he
makes, while he makes it. We can't
hear him, we can only imagine the
sound. Find “The Geese and the
Ghost” and study its cover. [If it
pleases you, you’ll probably like
what’s inside.

Now this question. Would you rather Pitt be thought of as
top-notch institution of higher learning because of its
valuable contributions to the fields of medicine, dentistry,
pharmacy, nursing and engineering, or because of running
backs, split ends, tackles, linebackers, safeties and the glory
of winning a national title? ‘

to submit to him a class schedule for this term.

“I understand that his football advisor fixed him up with
enough credits to gt-_aduate,” a spokesman for the speech and

Schepner’s straight-faced remarks
are equivalent to Tony Dorsett
wondering if he could have made the Pitt
football team after missing spring
practice, for heading into the NCAA
finals at Cleveland State March 24-26,
Schepner is an All-American candidate
along with teammates Jerry DeMuro,
Dave Civis and Mark Shuman. An
impressive performance in Ohio, like the
one he turned in at the Eastern Regionals
two weekends ago at West Virginia,
would probably deliver that title to the
tall senior from Canevin High School.

At Morgantown, Schepner broke the
Pitt school record in the 200-yard
freestyle and along with DeMuro,
Shuman and Civis, helped establish new
University marks in all three relay
events——400-yard medley relay, 400-yard
freestyle relay and 800-yard freestyle.
Schepner just missed setting_a new Pitt
record in the 50-yard freestyle by five
one-hundredths of a second. I

Obviously, Schepner hasn’t let his ill-
founded pessimism affect his
performance in the pool. Breaking
records while running up an impressive
tally sheet’ of swimming
accomplishments isn’t new to Schepner.
He was the Panthers’ MVP as a
freshman, a finalist in the Eastern
Regional Championships for four years
and has placed in the finals at the NCAA
National Championships for three years.

season.

- “We have a lot of strength up top,”
Dieffenbach confirmed. “Liebenguth
and Habbel are going to hpld their own
on the trips Then we have sort of a
drop.”

Third-seeded Kevin Quay, fourth-
ranked Harry Habbel, fifth-seeded Tom
Gault and John Girty in the sixth slot
round out the lineup. Gault and Habbel
team for second-seeded doubles and
Girty and Quay for third.

The competition on the road trip has
never been tested by Pitt, but
Dieffenbach claims the teams are top
notch.

“North Carolina State and Duke have
some players who could become
international touring pros,” he said.

“Most of the teams down South are:
pretty even, talent-wise.”

“I'm not making any predictions for
the season,” Dieffenbach continued.
“I’m not overly optimistic or overly
pessimistic.

“We’ve been lucky because of the
weather—it’s been excellent lately. And
I’m really pleased with the workouts.
The team will do its best.”

Young Pulls Upset on Foreman

SAN JUAN, P.R. (AP)—Jimmy

. Young, clever and cool, knocked George

Foreman down in the 12th round and
scored a unanimous decision Thursday
night in a major boxing upset.

The stunning loss knocked Foreman
out of the top contender’s role for the

heavyweight title and severely damaged
his hopes for a rematch with champion
Muhammad Ali.

Young brought a sellout crowd of
10,000 in the Roberto Clemente
Coliseum roaring to their feet in the 12th
and final round.

Slim Victories Narrow

(AP)—Top—ranked Michigan

and Marquette posted hair-raising
victories and mighty Kentucky, flashy
Nevada-Las Vegas and unheralded
North Carolina-Charlotte also won
Thursday night to advance to the
regional finals of the NCAA college
basketball tournament.

The Wolverines held off stubborn

two seconds left to slip by No. 10 Notre
Dame 79-77. Butch Lee’s driving layup
with less than one minute to play stood

up as No. 7 Marquette slipped past

Kansas State 67-66.
Kentucky, ranked third, got 29 points

from reserve Truman Claytor to pull
away from VMI 94-78. No. 4 Nevada-
Las Vegas topped Utah 88-83 as Robert
Smith sank four foul shots in the final
minute. And No. 17 North Carolina-
Charlotte assumed the role of
tournament dark horse with a stunning
81-59 romp over No. 6 Syracuse.

Saturday’s regional pairings will
include Michigan-NC Charlotte for the
Mideast title at Lexington, Ky., and
North Carolina-Kentucky for the East
crown at College Park, Md.

Nevada-Las Vegas will go against the
winner of the UCLA-Idaho State game
in the West semifinals at Provo, Utah,
and Marquette will play the winner of
the Wake Forest—Southern Illinois game
in Saturday’s Midwest finals at
Oklahoma City.

With Foreman gpressing him into a
corner, Young unleashed a series of six
solid head shots that sent the former
champion reeling backward, obviously
hurt.

Young turned tiger, leaping to the
pursuit and landing a left and right that
put Foreman down. Big George was up
immediately but referee Waldemar
Schmidt ruled it a knockdown and gave
Foreman a mandatory eight count.

Foreman lasted the round, but the

crowd sensed the outcome as it cheered .

“Jimmy Young, Jimmy Young.”

Schmidt scored it 118-111 for Young
under the 10-point must system. Judge
Cesar Ramos saw it 116-112 for Young
and judge Ishmael Fernandez called it
115-114 Young. The AP ruled it 116-110
for Young. -

Young showed his coolness in the
seventh round, when it looked as though
Foreman would end the fight with a
knockout. -

In the first 15 seconds of the round, as
Young backed along the ropes, Foreman
unleashed a powerful left hook that
stunned the Philadelphian, who reeled
across the ring with Big George in
pursuit.

For most of the first two minutes of
the round, Foreman was in complete
command, but could not land the punch

to put Young down.

Young did not panic and did not try to
fight his way out of trouble. His head
gradually cleared and he came back in
the final minute with several head shots
that had the crowd cheering him.

Young’s greatest victory was his 21st
against five losses and two draws.’ Fore-
man’s defeat, which snapped a five-bout
winning streak that began after his title
loss to Ali in 1974, was his second
against 45 wins.

Before the fight, Young had said the
fifth round would be the decisive round.
He was two rounds off, but he couldn’t
care less.

The victory may have earned Young
another shot at Ali, to whom he lost a
disputed decision last year. Promoter
Don King shouted from the ring, “We’re
going to make Young-Ali.”

When asked about a Foreman-Ali
rematch, King said, simply, “We want
to get George back into the ring as soon
as possible.”

While the loss does not rule out
another Foreman-Ali fight, it certainly
hurt Foreman’s financial bargaining
power. ,

Foreman, who seldom has had to go
more than five rounds in his 47-bout
career, proved to doubters that he could
go the distance. But it was costly proof.

Foreman, who weighted 229, was paid
$700,000 for the fight which was shown
live on home television in the United
States.

Young, who weighed 212, earned
$250,000 as he continued his rag-to-
riches rise that got its start with his

disputed loss to Ali.

GYMNASTS IN ILLINOIS

Inactive since February 9, the Pitt‘
men’s gymnastics team hops back into
action this weekend, traveling to Illinois
State University to compete in the
Eastern Championships.

The Panthers finished the regular
season with a 3-2 record—their first"

, winning slate in over four years. Paced

by senior Rob Pasterick, the club
outperformed West Virginia, Navy and
Slippery Rock while dropping contests to
Temple and Penn State.

The gymnasts have spent the’ last
month practicing compulsory moves that
are necessary for post-season
competition.

“We have to learn compulsory moves
to take the full team,” coach Frank
D’Amico explained after the Slippery
Rock contest. “I would like to take the
whole team and place in the top six, but I
don’t know how things will go.”

Competing against teams from all
over the eastern part of the country, the
Panthers will have to turn in some
outstanding performances to make

D’Amico’s sixth place finish come true.
