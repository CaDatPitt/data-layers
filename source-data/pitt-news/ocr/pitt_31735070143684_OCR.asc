FACT may have lost its latest legal bat-
tle, but the war over the drink tax is still
brewing.

The Friends Against Counterproductive
Taxation — a group of Allegheny County
restaurant owners — has been opposed
to Allegheny County’s 10 percent tax on
poured alcoholic drinks since its inception
in January. _

Last month, FACT submitted a refer-
endum for the November ballot that asked

I voters if they would favor a reduction in

the drink tax from 10 percent to 0.5 of a
percentage point. But the County Board of
Elections shot down the referendum by a

FACT insists, however, that the public
has the power to ﬁx the rate of some taxes,
like the drink tax, and that the state law is
still in their favor.

The board of elections’ three mem-
bers, Judge Christine Ward, Judge Dwayne
Woodruff and Judge Jill Rangos, were ap-
pointed as replacements. The three regular
elections board members, John DeFazio,
Dan Onorato and Chuck McCullough,
were- substituted because of their already
publicly known positions on the referen-
dums.

County Council member Matt Drozd

thinks that County Council will follow
FACT’s footsteps by also seeking an appeal
to the ruling.

Drozd said, however,

unanimous vote last Tues-
day- ‘ ‘
“We’re going to contin-
ue to operate under the as-
sumption that we’ll be on
the ballot in November,”‘
said John Graf, FACT’s
secretary.
Dissatisﬁed with the
board’s decision, FACT
appealed the board’s ruling

This doesn't change any of
our plans. We always knew

we WCYC gOlI'lg IO be in court.

that it would not be worth
it for County Council to
try and appeal. I

“I will not support any
appeal on behalf of Coun-
cil to appeal the judges
ruling,” he said. “I believe
we pay too much in legal
fees now, and it’s -a waste
of taxpayers’ money.”

mon Pleas Court. I '

In addition to denying FACT’s referen-
dum, the board also rejected a referendum
conceived by County Council that sought
to ask voters if they would prefer their
property taxes to be raised in exchange for
a repeal of the drink tax.

The board dr elections declined both.

referendums because a provision in the
state law that says only County Council has
the authority to raise, lower or repeal taxes
such as the drink tax, Graf said.

In other words, a referendum cannot
reduce a tax by referendum, regardless of
whether it’s provided by the citizens or City
Council itself. I

Although FACT’s ap-
peal has been ﬁled, the outcome is still

‘pending. Graf said he expects that the '

Common Pleas president, Judge Joseph
James, will make the ruling on the appeal.

The rejection by the board of elections
may be ahurdle to FACT ’s progress, but
the group has long been gearing up fora
court battle.

“This doesn’t change any of our plans.
We always knew we were going to be in
court,” said Graf. “We’re going to push this
appeal.”

FACT plans to remain adamant and will
take its case to a high level if necessary.

“In all likelihood it’s going to go to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court,” said Graf

Students challenged to 'green'

oldjbuildings for 5k cash prize

by Mary Hancock
For T /26 Pitt New

If you go green, you just might win some,
tOO.

College students from Allegheny, Butler,
\X/estmoreland and Washington counties can
win up to $5,000 for designing a product to
limit energy_usage in older homes through a
contest created by Pitt’s Mascaro Center for
Sustainable Innovation and the Heinz Endow-
ment I

“The development of a real product could
impact every home owner in the region and
beyond,” said Gena M. Kovalcik, co-director
of Administration and External Relations at

the Mascaro Center. “It could hit everyone’s

pocket book.”

The 2008 Energy Efficient Building Tech-
nologies Challenge for undergraduate students
aims to spark the creation of ﬂexible products
that can be placed in an already existing home
or building and that can reduce a home’s elec-
trical bill.

According to the 2007 Buildings Energy
Data Book, residential buildings use 22 per-
cent of the United States’ primary energy con-
sumption, and all buildings cumulatively use
40 percent.

Although some college students may feel
that they are still in training, Kovalcik says that
the idea of a younger designer is all a part of
the project’s aim.

“Engineers that are already in the ﬁeld,
already working, just get conﬁned,” she said.
“Young people have creative ideas and time.”

 

Pitt junior Jeff Brinkhus, a computer en-

gineering major, said he has no doubt that
this product could sell, and the idea that this
contest could help regular homes in the city to
become energy efficient entices him.

“Not only would a lot of people be 
touse a device that paid for itself in a year, but
I think it would have made a really fun sum‘-
mer for me to work on a project like that,” said
Brinkhus. “And, of course, the environmental
impact would be quite signiﬁcant if enough
people were to use the product.”

Though Brinkhus did not have the chance
to take partjin this competition, he said he
believes that his peers could take advantage
of this situation to produce a truly beneﬁcial
product.

“I think it’s interesting to see buildings like
the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz Cha-
pel in the same block,” said Brinkhus. “After
I graduate and am out in the workingworld,
I would definitely invest in a product to keep
Pittsburgh this way.”

The amount of money saved on the elec-
tirical bill must be more than or equal to the
cost of the product within a year.

Those competitors that take on the chal-
lenge are asked by the contest rules to form
teams of between two and live participants

To beleligible for the contest, teams must
submit their designs by Oct. 31, 2008. The
winning design will be chosenion Apnl 20,
2009. The team that designs the winning
productwill win $5,000 dollars along with reg-
istration to Engineering Sustainability 2009, a
Pitt-CMU conference held later this year at the
David L. Lawrence Convention Center.

a area with a population of less than two

taken annually via Port Authority vehicles,
it simply cannot be disputed that the eco-

southwest Pennsylvania would suffer a

any signiﬁcant way. It is equally apparent,

Registrar Sam Conte said a self—registtation
system will be available for Pitt students through
the PeopleSoft system this spring to register for
the fall 2009 term. '

In October, students at Pitt’s four branch
campuses in Johnstown, Greensburg, Bradford
and Titusville will have the option to  their
Spring 2009 courses on their own computers

The PeopleSoft computerized registration
system that Pitt uses on the my.pitt.edu portal
has been able to support self-registration since
2006, but Pitt has waited to‘ enable the option.

“We wanted to make sure the tight system
was in place and that we approached it in a
logical and sequential manner. I certainly would
have like to have had this workable sooner,” said
Conte.

Of the 60 research universities thatare mem-
bers of the Association of American Universi-
ties, Pitt and MIT are the only schools to not
offer self-registration for students, according
to Conte and information published on the
schools’ Web sites. Pitt ranks among the top
seven American research universities in the 2007
evaluation of this group by the Center for Mea-
suting University Experience.

Purdue University, a fellow AAU member,
offered a self-registration option for the first
time this fall.

“It will be done by appointments, since you
can’t have 30,000 students logging on to the sys-
tem at the same time,” said Conte “The registra-
tion system will stay the same as it is now, but
students can do it on their own.”

Once registration is over, students will not

For students who need assistance with regis-

them.

One component that will change with self-
registration is students’ adherence to prerequi-
sites

Currently, the system has the ability to check
for co—requisites, like labs and recitations, and
prerequisites during registration, but students
can bypass them when they add/ drop courses

Conte said they’re  on  that no

Amethyst Initiative rethinks drinking age

One of the largest, ongoing

’ problems facing college campuses

is underage  According to

 the 2005 National Survey on Drug
t Use and Health, about 75 percent

 of people aged12 to 20 reported

having consumed alcohol at some
point in their lives, and about 28

E percent reported having consumed
E alcohol in the past month.

And among people aged 18 to

 22, those enrolled full time in col-
. lege were about 33 percent more

likely to have consumed alcohol
in the past month than those who

V were not in school.

A group of college and universi-

 ty chancellors, presidents and other
A leaders aim to change this, with the
1 argument that the current 

age promotes a culture of danger-

A ous binge  and unsuper-

vised behavior. But they don’t just
want to enforce the current laws

more rigidly — they want to change ‘

the structure of the law altogether

M to lower the  age.

The group has faced opposition

: fromMothers AgainstDrunkDriv-
  and other groups, even though
i the statement that the members

have signed does not explicitly call
for a lowered  age, but rath-

: er seeks to call an informed debate"

over the failures of the current law
\While it’s clear that there are

some major problems with the cur-

rent  age lirnit, it isn’t as clear

: that lowering the bar of entry is go-

ing to help. Lowering the 
age seems more like a cry of sur-
render rather than a legitimate tac-
tic that trusts 18-year—olds to be as

l mature as people three years older.

Not to mention the point that

A if the  age is lowered from

21 to 18, the problem doesn’t sirn—
ply go away. College students might
be able to drink legally at that point,

year-old with a fake driver’s license 
that lism him as 21, it’s also easy to E
irrlagine a 16-year-old with an ID f

that says he’s 18.

Lowering the  age sirn- 5
ply takes the underage problem out 
of the hands of colleges and uni- Q
versities and plants it firmly in the 

lap of  schools instead.

The Amethyst Initiative is doing 5
the country a service by raising the 2
bar for the discussion of the drink- 5
ingage——withthebackingof so
many high-level college and univer— .
sity officials, such as the presidents J

of Duke and Ohio State University

(although Chancellor Nordenberg I

has yet to sign), it’s clearly some-
thing to be taken seriously.

But  the discussion to the
idea that because 21 isn’t working,

we should scrap the whole  
I Colummiit

Instead, we should look at why 

doesn’t seem very productive.

21 isn’t working.iMany of thesig—
natories of the Amethyst Initiative

simply seem to feel that college 
students are going to drink no mat-

ter what, but the current culture of 
tolerance mediated with light legal ’
punishment does little to discour- ‘

age the culture.

_ The issue is too split already for 
A ' the 'cliscu‘issiori7”to‘ be "truly 
ful. Rather than resign themselves 
to discussing the hopeless fate :

of underage  on college 
campuses, perhaps the Amethyst i

Initiative could promote discus-
sion about discouraging underage

dnnking, educating and helping :

students, and enforcing the laws as
they stand

Instead of redefining the law 1

so the problem isn’t a problem any 3

more, this debate might be a good
opportunity to discuss how to make
the current laws work the way they
should, and what colleges and uni-
versities can do to help.

Have something to say?

Letterst   

Friday Sept. 5, 2008
To the Editors,

Robert Kosarowich’s letter to the editor addressing “Palin’s appeal” is a perfect example of the ner-
vousness felt by liberals concerning their chances in  the White House ir1 November. Kosaro-
wich, a Democrat, opined the names of possible vicepresidential candidates whom Sen.]ohn 
should have chosen to  Republicans the best chance to win in November. ‘The liberal-biased media
has been smearing Gov: Sarah Palin since she was selected to be on the Republican ticket. '

Why should the conservative base, which is clearly energized by the selection of Palin, take a libera1’s
advice in whom to choose for vice president? Why should we take the advice of the partywho has
managed to lose the past two presidential elections? - _ ‘ .

Kosarowich speaks of the “troopergate” scandal, in which Palin is accused of  the Alas
Commissioner of Public Safety, Walt Monegan, for not  her ex-brother-in—law As is typically done
by the liberal media, Kosarowich does not tell both sides of the story. Palin’s ex—brother-in-law tasered
his 10-year old stepson Is that the type of person who you want patrolling the streets to keep you
safe?

Obama. In addition to  the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and the governor of the state, she has fought
corruption ir1 both parties She also chaired the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which
is responsible for  oil and gas production and reservoir depletion, and she servedas the ethics
supervisor of that commission. t ' . _ » « 

What has Obarna done to advance the country? He hasn’t run a city, he hasn’t rim a state, and he
voted not “yes,” not ‘fno,” but “present” 130 times in the Illinois state  He has written two
memoirs, but he has yet to author a major piece of legislation in the US Senate.  was a “com-
munity organizer,” but he has refused to elaborate on what a community organizer is The Democratic

Party nominated an empty suit to be its candidate for president The Democrats need not lecture con— -

servatives on who should be the  president of the Republican Party.

Jesse]. Sabatini
Research Associate

Kosarowich paints Palin as being inexperienced, but she has more exeo itive expend 'ence than

Democrats need to own up .

Saturday Sept. 6, 2008 ~
Dear Editor,

I would like to call into question the ethical character of The Pitt News for printing “Breaking
bread i.n Tower B.” The printing of such a potentially .offensive article reveals poor judgment on
behalf of the writer who chose such a topic and the editor who approved the ‘story with pho-
tographs and all. Writer Noah Levinson himself admits in the article that “some Catholic and
Christian groups might find Morelli’s impersonation offensive.” The author attempts to absolve

Morelli’s responsibility by explaining,“He’s just a normal student who doesn’t believe in conserva-'

tive haircuts.” However, “normal students” are not featured with a front—cover photograph and
two—page article about their hairstyles or uncanny resemblances P

If Morelli’s actions could be interpreted as deserving disdain were he to be more than a “nor-
mal student,” then the campus newspaper that makes this student a celebrity takes away his “nor-’
mal” stature and is thus responsible for the offense. v

Whatif Morelli’s beard and  beenwhite, his friends donned him in a robe, gave him
a copy of the Ten Commandments and paraded him around as Moses? Would the article have
been published then, accompanied with photographs of the Moses look-alike ir1 front of the
Cathedral of  What if he were Middle Eastern and instead of a robe,  a towel for
a turban, and people laughed over his astonishing impersonation of Muhammad? What if the
resemblance was to Gandhi? ’ ‘ i 4

If Morelli looked like Brad Pitt or George Washington, there- would be no need for an- ethical
inquiry. Instead, he looks iikechrisr Byraisirighim to the-"status of a celebrity, itrnakes amockery
of the founder of a religion whom many Pitt students believe to be God — but this is acceptable,
even newsworthy, if it’s Christ; Wouldit be the same if it were Moses or Muhammad? ~'

What Morelli and his friends do in Tower B is up to their own discretion. But a university-wide
paper elevating this student to celebrity status simply highlights and gloriﬁes his actions — actions
that the article itself says are potentially offensive Who then is to hold you, The Pitt News, ac-

' countable?

The Pitt Panthers began playing better Sat-
urday as the game went along.

It was a complete turnaround from Pitt’s
ﬁrst game of the year, a 27-17 loss to Bowling
Green — a game in which the Panthers didn’t
score after halftime.

And unlike last week, Pitt earned a victory,
evening its record at 1-1 with a 27-16 win over
Buffalo.

Pitt coach Dave Warmstedt said he had
reasons to believe the team was improving.

“The most encouraging  to me was
halftime,” said \Wannstedt, adding that even
though the Panthers held the lead at half in
their first game, the feeling in the locker room
wasn’t upbeat because they had already blown
a 14-point lead.

“This week we knew it was going to be a
60-minute ballgame,” said Warmstedt.

In its first game, Pitt held a 17-14 lead at
the half but was outscored 13-0 in the second
half by Bowling Green. The Panthers had a
10-9 lead going into the half against Buffalo

last week.”

McCoy certainly wasn’t the only
member of the offense to rebound
after a poor showing in the team’s
first game.

\X/annstedt, McCoy and quarter—
back Bill Stull all praised the play of
the offensive line.

“Our front guys played a hell of
a game,” said Stull. “They gave me
some time and gave our receivers a
chance to make some big plays.”

\X/ith the additional time, Stull
went 22-33 for 241 yards to seven
different receivers. His one inter—
ception came on a desperation
heave at the end of the first half

“Our receivers played with bet-
ter energy than they did last week,”
said \X/annstedt. “Last week we
dropped a couple of balls early, and
I don’t think we were very strong
mentally.”

Oderick Turner led Pitt with
69 receiving yards, and  Porter
pulled in a team-high six recep-
tions.

One of the biggest catches of
the game came from the hands, or
more appropriately, hand of Cedric
McGee.

Pitt led 17-16 on its first drive
of the fourth quarter, facing a
third—and—four from the Buffalo
44. McGee cut across the middle
of the ﬁeld, but Stull threw the ball
behind him.

While in rnid-air, McGee
stretched his arm as far behind him
as he could and hauled in the pass
using only his left arm.

The play went for 10 yards and
a first down. The drive resulted in
a two-yard touchdown run by Mc-
Coy, giving the Panthers a 24-16
lead. McGee ﬁnished the game
with three receptions for 28 yards.

Along with strong play from
the offense, the Pitt defense man-
aged to hold a Buffalo offense that
scored 42 points in its first game to
just 16 Saturday.

But there were times during the 
game that the Bulls’ offense, led 
by quarterback Drew Wiﬂy and ‘

running back James Starks, searn—

lessly moved the ball. The second i
drive of the game, which resulted 3
in a touchdown rush by Brandon 1

September 8, 2008

to put game away

On \X/illy’s only touchdown pass
of the game, he hit Brett Hamlin,
who had not a single Pitt defender
within at least 7 yards of him, for a
39-yard touchdown pass.

But when it needed a big stop,
the Pitt defense was able to come
up with one.

On the very ﬁrst drive of the
game, Tommie Duhart blocked a
44-yard ﬁeld goal attempt.

After the Bulls scored to make it
17-16 Pitt, the Panthers went three-
and-out and punted the ball.

On a third—and—six from close
to midﬁeld, Greg Romeus and Ja-
baal Sheard combined for a sack,
forcing Buffalo to punt.

Late in the fourth quarter,
with the game out of reach, Eric
Thatcher intercepted a pass in Pitt
territory. \X/illy hadn’t thrown an
interception in his last 284 pass at—
tempts, which was the longest ac-
tive streak in the nation.

One streak that continued
through the game was Pitt kicker
Connor Lee’s school record of
consecutive point after touch-
downs made, which he increased
to 80, connecting three times. dur-
ing the game.

Next up for the Panthers is a bye
week before Iowa comes to Heinz
Field Sept. 20. \X/annstedt said the
team still has plenty to improve
upon, starting with fundamentals.

“Tackling, blocking, throwing
and catching the ball are things we
have to be able to do consistently,”
he said.

W/annstedt also said he’s not
usually in favor of bye weeks com-
ing so early in the year, but he’s
looking forward to this one. His
quarterback agreed.

“It’s the perfect timing for a bye
week,” said Stull. ‘‘\We just got a
win, and we have a lot of things to
clean up.”
