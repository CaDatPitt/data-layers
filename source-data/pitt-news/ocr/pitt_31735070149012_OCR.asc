For the ﬁrst time since 2003, the
Pitt basketball teams will host a
Midnight Madness event to in-
troduce the new-look Panthers to
their fans prior to the new season,
the University’s athletic depart-
ment stated in a press release
Wednesday.

But the event won’t be held at
the Petersen Events Center nor at
any other basketball arena.

Instead, the men’s and wom-
en’s teams will hold their ﬁrst
NCAA practice of the year Friday,
Oct. 12, on an outdoor basketball
court that will be constructed on
Bigelow Boulevard between the
Cathedral of Learning and the
William Pitt Union. The outdoor
Midnight Madness will serve as
partsof the University’s home-
coming weekend activities and
celebrations of the schoo_l’s 225th
anniversary.

Lights, portable bleachers and
a video board will be set up for
the event-, which will feature team
introductions as well as several
contests and promotional activi-
ties. Admission will be free and
open to the public.

There will be several other
events on campus before the bas-
ketball teams take the court at
9:45 p.m., including a ﬁreworks
and laser show beginning at 9:15.
There will also be a student gath-
ering in the William Pitt Union
following teams’ appearance.

If adverse weather conditions
threaten to affect the evening’s
events, Pitt’s Midnight Madness
will be moved to the Petersen
Events Center. ﬂ

New, cash-free parking meters to berolled
out in Oakland this Friday

Megan Trimble
Staff Writer

Students and visitors planning
to park on the streets of Oakland
can leave their quarters at home
without the fear of expired me-
ters this Friday.

The Public Parking Authority
of Pittsburgh has partnered with
Cale America Inc. to install a
new pay-by-license parking me-
ter system that replaces single-
space meters with multi-space
machines in the North Shore,
Oakland, Southside Works, the
Downtown area, the Strip Dis-
trict and some PPAP surface lots.

This phase of the meter tech-

nology upgrade includes install-
ing 504 meters as part of the
capital improvements program
for the Authority, PPAP spokes-
woman Patricia Konesky said in
an email.

While the North Shore me-
ters are currently the only me-
ters that are fully operational,
meters installed in the entire
Oakland area are scheduled to
be fully functioning as of Fri-
day, Aug. 31. The installations,
which are to be completed by
late September, will replace
some 3,000 single—space street
meters currently in place across
Pittsburgh, according to a Pitts-
burgh Parking Authority press

release on the project.

Konesky said that the new
machines are an easy, three-step
process that grants an alterna-
tive payment method to quarters
and an optional receipt.

“These machines are as easy
as one-two—three,” Konesky
said. “One: Enter your license
plate number. Two: Make your
payment, either with quarters
or credit cards. Three: Go,”

While some large, silver
multi-space meters have been
in place around Oakland in areas
around Hillman and Carnegie
libraries, the new meters do not
require a printed receipt to be
returned to vehicles.

Konesky said that the new
machines can print receipts at

. the user’s request but that the

new system does not require re-
ceipts to be placed on vehicles’
Windshields for enforcement
purposes.

According to the Pittsburgh
Parking Authority press release,
'60 of the new machines will be
dedicated to replacing the previ-
ous multi-space parking models.

21-year-old who regularly

Allocations Committee names experienced student

leader Kate Malekoff as allocations liaision

Pat McAteer
Senior Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Allocations Committee of
Pitt’s Student Government Board
announced the selection of Kate
Malekoff as interim board liaison

after former liaison Rya_n Gayman,

departed earlier this summer. ' _

Allocations Committee Chair-
man Mike Nites said Malekoff’s
responsibilities as a member of
the Allocations Committee include
representing one-tvvelfth of all stu-
dent groups on campus and pro-
viding their assigned groups with
assistance on issues related to the
allocations process.

According to the Allocation
Committee’s manual -— available
on Pitt’s SGB website —- student
organizations submit budgets in
March for the fall. term and late
October or early November for the

Spring term. The liaison assigned
to the student group then reviews
the submitted budget to ensure
that it is completed correctly.
Facing a relatively_short hir-
ing period after Gayman made
the decision to graduate in June
rather than pursue a bachelor’s of

A : philosophy degree, Nites said he

searched for candidates with ex-

_ perience in the allocations process. .

g 7 Yesterday, Nites, SGB President

James Landreneau and an undis- -

closed member of the Allocations
Committee interviewed a number
of applicants for the position after
posting applications online earlier
this month.

' “We’re looking for someone
who understands and knows the
process. They don’t have to be
perfect at it,” Nites said. “They
could be a business manager or
someone wholhas sent in two to

three requests before.” .

Day last year. A ’

_After hearing the news of her
hiring, Malekoff said she was “re-

A group of‘1o politically ac-
tive students gathered around
a TV last night — not to watch
Paul Ryan speak at the Republi-
can National Convention, but to
learn how to exercise their civil
liberties when interacting with
the police.

The Pitt College Libertarians
held an event in Posvar Hall at
8:45 on Wednesday night to
show the video “Busted: The
Citizen’s Guide to Surviving
Police Encounters.” The video,
which is available for free on
Youtube, stresses three points:
Never consent to a search, never

answer police questions without
a lawyer present, and ask the po-

lice if you’re free to go instead of
waiting for them to dismiss you.

The Pitt College Libertarians
hosting the event said they felt
it was important for everyone to
know the law and how to use it.

“We stand for civil rights,”
said Cameron Gray, vice presi-
dent of the College Libertarians.
“We have the Fourth, Fifth and
Sixth Amendments for a rea-
son? ‘

For other members of the
College Libertarians, it wasn’t
just about staying out of trouble.

“Everybody likes getting out
of a ticket,” said Colinjones, Pitt
senior and member of the Col-
lege Libertarians, “but it’s also
good to show people in power
that we know our rights.”

The Pitt College Libertarians

is a campus group dedicated
to supporting and advocating
Libertarian ideals of personal
freedom, a limited governmental
role in society and principles of
non-aggression.

Libertarian ideals are most
prominently represented by the
Texas Republican congressman
and frequent presidential can-
didate Ron Paul, who ran as the
Libertarian Party’s candidate for
president in 1988.

“Busted” featured Ira Glass-
er, former executive director of
the ACLU. Glasser explained the
rights given to citizens by the
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amend-
ments using three different sto-
ries: three young people in a car
with marijuana who get pulled
over, a young man on the street

themed movie viewing  

who gets interrogated by police
and a young woman who has po-
lice show up at her house party.

In the traffic-stop situation,
Glasser recommends not an-
swering the classic “do you know
why I pulledtiyou over” question
to avoid incriminating yourself.
Instead, ask the officer if you’re
being detained or if you are free
to go. Glasser advises not con-
senting to any searches of the
car and accepting a ticket with-
out complaint. '

In the situation involving the
street stop, the video reminds
viewers that while you can ver-
bally refuse a search, never
physically resist police or run

because these actions can lead

CDPA
details new
internship a
program

Andrew Shull
News Editor

The University announced on
Monday a new program that
would guarantee every student
an internship.

The question is, “How?”

Alyson Kavalukas, the intern-
ship coordinator at the Office of
Career Development and Place-
ment Assistance, said that their
new, free of cost Internship Place-
ment Program will use the CDPA’s
experience and network to place
students with employers.

“To the best of our knowl-
edge, we are the only school in
the country doing this,” Kavalu-
kas said. »

She said the ﬁrst step in the A

process is to register on Fu-
tureLinks, a portal on students’
my.pitt that offers career servic-
es, and upload a resumé. Using
FutureLinks, students can then
register for sixihour—long group
sessions that will cover network-
ing, resumés, interviewing and
search strategies. Following those
sessions, students enrolled in the

program will have individual re- _

sumé reviews and mock inter-
views. . . .
Kavalukas said the CDPA will
then work extensively with stu-
dents to help-them ﬁnd intern-
ships. To do so, she said the CDPA
is “tripling” its networking ef-
forts. The office will also offer
guidance to students who are

looking for the best fits for them. '

Maria Felton, who is in her

. second year of pharmacy school

at Pitt, said that she thinks the
new program will be great if all
goes according to plan.

“I know it’s hard to find in-
ternships in Pittsburgh with all
of the colleges here,” she said.

But this isn’t a quick process.

Kavalukas said that the pro-
gram guarantees placement in an

PARKING

multi—space parking models that have
stood along with the single-space meters
on Bigelow Boulevard.

“[Parking] is pretty awful because the
area is so busy, but [the multi—space style]
is so much more convenient because you
can use cash or credit cards or whatever
you have,” Heidenreich said. “It’s a lot
easier because you don’t need to always
have a million quarters on you.”

In late July, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
and the Pittsburgh ParkingsAuthority
ceremonially purchased a parking space
under the new system and established
Pittsburgh as the first American city to
adopt, on more than a pilot basis, the
pay—by-plate technology that the new
meters feature.

In a Pittsburgh Parking Authority
press release of the event, Ravenstahl
said that the new system aligns with
improvements being made to upgrade
the city.

“Residents will ﬁnd thetprocess to be
an improvement over the coin—dependent
system being replaced, and visitors will

experience an additional opportunity to I»

discover Pittsburgh as the contemporary,
technology-oriented city it has come to
be,” Ravenstahl said at the event.
Konesky said that the multi—space
pay-by-plate machines are more efficient
than single—space meters in regard to

to added charges. Glasser also advises
being polite to officers and not talking
back. If the police arrest you, Glasser
instructs viewers not to sign any confes-

sions without a lawyer present, even if
the cops offer you a better deal.

During the house party incident, ’

Glasser reminds viewers to speak to of-
ﬁcers outside the house and not to con-
sent to a search, as officers need a search
warrant from a judge to enter.

“Your rights
are like
muscles: If
you don’t use
them, they
atrophy.”

Jamie |\/lcKibbIn

“Busted” also went over exceptions in
citizens’ civil rights. Americans consent

maintenance, collections and consumer
use. But for some, the change will be an
adjustment.

Pittsburgh resident David Rothman
approached the new meter system on
Forbes Avenue Wednesday in an attempt
to park his car and visit Pamela’s res-
taurant, but he was not impressed by
the change.

“I guess I can use my card now, but I
don’t see this as a huge improvement,”
said Rothman, 67. “The only thing I could
think to make it better would be if the
machine scanned my license number, but
instead I have to look up my number and
figure out what to type in. So I’m taking
all of that time up instead.”

Rothman said that people should be
more concerned with parking meter rates
and defective meters.

“I think the amount of credit you get
for a quarter is ludicrous. If they want
people to come park in Oakland and
downtown in the city, more time should
be given to the amount put in the meter,”
he said. “But I do know that one time I
had to pay a ﬁne for parking at a broken
meter, so maybe that will be fixed now.”

Konesky said that the $7 million cost
of the current program phase includes
meter warranty and maintenance for
seven years and that the old, single—space
meters are retained by the Authority for
use in other sections of the city and for
inventory replenishing. I

to a search every time they cross a border,
board a commercial airplane or enter a
private event, like ‘a sporting event or a
concert, where security‘personn'el are
present.

Police can also search your house or
car without your consent if they have
probable cause to suspect illegal activity.
Glasser explained that the law around
probable cause is murky, but police can-
not search based on a: hunch; they need
something more concrete like the smell
of marijuana or illegal substances in plain
view. ~ : —

Gray -admitted that theevent was
sparsely attendedbecause hehad made
a mistake in printing the flyer, posting
the time of the event to be 7:30 p.m. in-
stead of 8:45 p.m. Last year the College
Libertarians viewed the same film at an
event co-sponsored by. the campus chap-

_ter of the National Organizationfor--the

Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML,
and it was attended by 24'people.

The students who were there were
fully behind the video’s message, and
for reasons beyond just getting out of
trouble. ‘

Jamie McKibbin, president of the
College Libertarians, agreed with that
sentiment, saying that the ignorance of

-civil rights is detrimental to our society.

“Your rights are like muscles: If you
don’t use them, they atrophy,” McKib-
bin said. I -

For instance,.Kavalukas said somebody

in an internship for the spring.

That time constraint worried Pitt senior

The Frat Star

Like his legislative record,
Paul Ryan’s college resumé is

pretty thin. His impressive sum-
mer internship in Washington
was sandwiched by loose campus
involvement during the academ-
ic year. While at Miami Univer-
sity of _Ohio, Ryan was mostly
involved in his social fraternity,
Delta Tau Delta, and the College
Republicans. Fittingly, Ryan
has collected nearly $25,000
from the Fraternity and Soror-
ity Political Action Committee
(FSPAC) — yes, that is actually
a lobbying group — which led
to several failed legislative at-
tempts to create tax loopholes
for the creation of Greek hous-
ing on college campuses. His
ideological mentor was alib-
ertarian economics professor,
and Ryan summarily fell in love
with the ultra-capitalist phi-
losophies of author Ayn Rand.
He wasindeed a_ budding ﬁscal
conservativewhile, ironically,
attending school on the Social
Security beneﬁts he collected

after the death of his father. As i

for his social life, Ryan dated an
African-American student, afact

claim for a Romney campaign

Demystifying the tale of the
wealthyas job creators

Daniel Okwaisie
For The‘Pz'tt News

r’ -Listen to some hard-line conserva-

tives talk, and you might encounter
two common themes: that the only
acquaintances they ever run into
are the widely loathed welfare kings
and queens, and that they believe
in the myth of the wealthy as “job
creators.”

It’s uncommon that people have
a debate about theeconomic direc-
tion of thecountry without bringing
up the story of the able-bodied guy
who has decided toilet the govern-
ment take care of himwhile he buys
ﬂat-screen TVs with welfare checks.
You know, the guy getting the “free
stu .” I

What is seldom noted in this oft-
repeated argument is that welfare
manipulation is not any‘ less of a
crime than tax evasion is. And since
tax evasion by some has never justi-
ﬁed everybody avoiding taxes, wel-
fare manipulation by a few should
certainly not warrant scrapping
the safety net for those who need
it. Welfare manipulation is a crime.

Coming back to the idea of “free
stuff”: Couldn’t it be considered
equally free stuff if the guy who has
millions of dollars sitting in his ac-
count wakes up in the morning to
ﬁnd out that the government has de-
cided to give him a few extra million
in the hope that he will create jobs
with it? The government is paying
him not because he has done some-
thing, but because it hopes he will
do something that it can’t prosecute
him for not doing if he doesn’t.

In a free-enterprise society like
America, anyone is free to start a
business, end a business or expand

set by law. The perception that an
absolute set of people in society act
as “job creators” runs afoul to the
free-enterprise philosophy that so
many Americans claim to hold.

If you woke up in Lothrop Hall
one morning and decided you want-
ed to start a business, you would
need two things: an idea for satisfy-
ing a demand and money. Let’s just
say you have studied the trends and
realized that this product or service
from your idea would sell if executed
properly. Step one would be com-
plete, leaving you to ﬁgure out step
two: funding the idea. This is where
the promoters of the “job creators”
theory ﬁnd ﬁiel for their assertions.
But to assume that only rich people

create jobs is to assume two things: _

one, that rich people are the only
ones capable of hatching good ideas
and two, that less affluent people
with good ideas can never have ac-
cess to money. Both assumptions
are, of course, not true.

The second assumption par-
ticularly is why ﬁnancial markets
exist. They exist to channel ~ﬁmds
from lenders to borrowers driven
by the nomad stick of incentiviza-
tion on all sides. Now, you might be

tempted to object and argue that it a

is the rich whose money is ﬂoating
around in the ﬁnancial markets and
being lent out to borrowers. That

is technically false, but I get your.

point. The technicality lies in the
fact that everyone’s money is tied
in the ﬁnancial system somehow
from the simple checking account
to the mutual fund which manages
retirement accounts. Pragmatically,
it is plausible to say that a bulk of the
funds circulating and being lent out
belongs to the wealthy in society,
but that makes little difference in
regard to why the funds end up in

tern because all parties involved
have their own self-interest in
mind. When people open saving
accounts or buy securities, they do
soprimarily because they want a
return on their investments and not
because they think it might create
jobs somewhere. The commercial
bank, venture capitalist or invest-
ment bank that receives the ﬁmds
loans them out because they want to
make more money off the interests
they aﬂix. Entrepreneurs then bor-
row it because they believe they can
make a proﬁt in excess of the bor-
rowed ﬁmds. Everyone thinks about
themselves throughout the process.

In this regard, a job creator can
be anyone who has an idea to serve
an existing market and can get ac-
cess to credit from a sound ﬁnan-
cial market to carry it out. Lots of
small businesses and, indeed, large
corporations are started by less af-
ﬂuent people who had good ideas.
Facebook hires peop1e;~hence, Mark
Zuckerberg is not a job creator be-
cause he was a billionaire; "he is a
billionaire now because he was a
job creator.

It is not even necessary to begin
counting the vast number of teach-
ers, professors, ﬁremen, policemen,
military’ servicemen, governors,
mayors, congressmen and senators
in order to recognize that the gov-
ernment is also capable of creating
jobs. Thus, implying that wealthy
people are the “job creators” is
ﬂawed or —— to be cynical — a plan

by the elite to purloin society. Delib— ‘

erately taking that ﬂawed implica-
tion and attempting to mold public
policy out of it is not only largely
disingenuous, but a serious setback
to the American dream — if there
is still one.

Mr. Straight Edge

The national media have told
the'story of Romney’s prankster
high school years. In contrast,
his college life seems to indi-
cate a much more mellow Mitt.
After one yearat
Stanford,.he left

France where he
found little suc-

people to Mor-
monism. After
returning state-
side two years
later, he quickly
married and went
back to school at
Brigham Young
University. There
he was a non-
traditional stu-
dent,’older than
his peers and al-
ready a father. And’for the ﬁrst
time in his life, he met ﬁnancial
struggle. According to wife Ann,
the Romneys had to sell-their
stocks just to get by because, “we
were living on the edge  nei-
ther one of us had a job.” That’s
right. Romney, the candidate
who preaches the importance of
good ﬁnancial practice the most,
didn’t even have a college job.

“The Tempest”

Sept. 1 to Sept. 23
Directed by: Alan Irvine
Pittsburgh Parks

Free Admission
412-404-8531

Curtis Breight, an English litera-
ture professor at Pitt, is an ex-
pert regarding all things Shake-
speare. He has dedicated his life
to teaching and studying the lit-
erary icon. When asked about
staging Shakespeare’s play “The
Tempest,” he claimed that it is
challenging to produce because a
director can take two approaches
to its interpretation: traditional
or contemporary.

So Alan Irvine, the director
of Shakespeare in the Park’s pro-
duction of “The Tempest,” had a
decision to make, and he decided
to take the contemporary route.

Irvine will stage the produc-
tion as a part of Shakespeare in
the Park, a yearly tradition that
allows the public nationwide to
enjoy some of Shakespeare’s best
plays outdoors and for free. The
Pittsburgh production will run
from Sept. 1 to Sept. 23, rain or
shine, at different parks within
the city. The first and last week-
ends’ productions will be located
at Frick Park, and the second and
third will be held at Arsenal Park
and Allegheny Commons West
Park.

Shakespeare in the Park has
performed free outdoor produc-
tions for the residents of Pitts-
burgh since 2005, beginning
with the play “As You Like It.”
Some other productions from
past years include “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” “The Tragedy of
Macbeth” and “Love’s Labour’s
Lost.” ‘

“The Tempest” — chosen
for this year — tells the story
of a man named Prospero and
his search to ﬁnd a husband for

_ his daughter, who grew up on an

isolated island. There are ongo-
ing themes of family relations

Actor Michael Mykita will play the role of Prospero in “The Tempest” at various Pittsburgh parks.

and connections, as well as tense
revenge.

“Prospero has his chance to
take revenge on the people who
took his kingdom away from him
years ago, but will he take that
revenge or not?” Irvine said.
The entire play leads up to the
moment when Prospero must
ultimately choose between ret-
ribution or forgiveness.

Michael Mykita plays the
challenging role of Prospero in
the play, and he’s turning to one
of his other talents for inspira-
tion.

“I actually do also perform as
a professional magician outside
of acting, and so I have a sense
of illusion and am used to being
in front of a crowd,” Mykita said.

Because Shakespeare’s texts
are so long, Irvine was forced to
cut the play by about a third of
its size, eliminating unnecessary
language throughout the plot.

“This was a very difficult play
to trim because there are a lot of
characters and only one or two
minor characters that can be

Norman Babcock isn’t just an
outcast. He can see dead people.

“ParaNorman” —— an ani-
mated movie from the makers
of “Coraline” — tells the story

of Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee)
and his town Blithe Hollow, a
place that is obsessed with the

paranormal and a rumored curse V

that resonates in every corner of
the town. A less—than—average
boy with a sixth sense, Norman
seems like the perfect combi-
nation of uninteresting and ab-
normal to be the quintessential
recluse. But when Blithe Hollow
suffers the repercussions from
its century-old curse, Norman is
the only personiwho can save it,
thanks to his freaky gift.»

Norman’s room has posters
and figurines of zombies plas-
tered to the walls and ceiling,
while more still lie on the floor.
Even his slippers and toothbrush
point to his obsession with the
reappearing dead.

But at the beginning of the
film, as he sits in his living room
speaking with his grandmother
-— a woman that no one else in

V his family addresses —— the audi-

ence quickly realizes that Nor-
man isn’t speaking to a living
person. Instead, he’s speaking

to her ghost, who’s destined to
walk the earth because of her
unﬁnished busingss. Uncontent

Norman believes he cannot have

will be lost on younger viewers.

adult viewers more of a reason

As summer wraps up,
reminisce with top tracks

Songs like “Brains” and “Stem” off Lower Dens’ album Noatrapics make for great

summer tracks.

John Teoli
PVPTS Comfributor

Summer music comes with the memory
of late nights, long days or an epic road
trip among friends, creating a playlist of
great songs that soundtrack the summer.
As another summer has ended —— our tan
lines now faded, and the leaves beginning
to brown — compulsive list-makers will
take this time to categorize the best of this
summer’s music.

Here is one tally of songs that have made
this summer truly remarkable.

“Myth” by Beach House

It can be argued that Beach House’s latest
album listens more like an expansion pack to
the excellent Teen Dream produced in 2010,
but how can you complain about having more
Beach House music?

The group is famous for Victoria Le-
grand’s bright layers of synths and beautiful,
yet commanding, voice that washes over her
audiences with a sense of euphoria. “Myth”
combines this classic sound with shimmer-
ing guitar riffs, booming percussion and a
sense of clarity provided by reducing the
amount of reverb used.

The music is warm and sunny, making
it the type of music that begs to be played
outside at any summer event.

“Brains” and “Stem” by Lower Dens

Lower Dens are an up—and— co ming band
out ‘of the rat’s nest of crime and indie music
known today as Baltimore. “Brains” and
“Stem,” although listed as two songs on the
album, listen best as one complete piece of
music. The songs share a continuous drum
beat and ﬂow into one another perfectly.

The track starts out simply with only
drums and bass marching the song forward
as a haze of guitar and synth slowly sur-
rounds the listener. After the ﬁrst chorus,
the true momentum of “Brains” comes for-
ward with layer upon layer of vocals building
during the verse as if the song has drifted
between separate planes of consciousness.
The chorus repeats, and the song strips itself
back to the drum and bass line from which it
originated — but instead of fading into the
next track, it enters its reprise.

“Stem” is a shorter instrumental track
that juxtaposes itself with the previous
song but sounds natural and completes the
greater movement. The track is a bit dark
and mysterious for a summer—themed list,

easy, but still popular, plot. The outcast
turns into a hero by saving the town from
a zombie curse, learning that he needs
others just as much as they need him.
Norman continues to see dead people and
might not make any more friends, but
the townspeople are grateful to him for
his actions, leaving the movie to wrap up
like most animated ﬁlms: with a childish,
happy ending.

“ParaNorman” feeds off the zombie
obsession that consumers have been
quick to eat up, making it a viable film
for those interestedin animation and
not—too-spooky horror films. But the plot
is fairly dull, and other than a few laughs,
the film doesn’t offer too much for mov-
iegoers.

cut,” Irvine said. He explained thatit was
difficult to determine what text to keep
and what to remove for the production.
“It took five drafts’ to get it to some-
thing we could use,” Irvine said.
Breight, who studies and compares
Shakespeare’s plays frequently, believes
that “The Tempest” is not one of Shake-
speare’s most impressive plays but that
it is the best example of his “critic—con-

structed romances.”

“Personally, I don’t rate it in my top 10,
but I tend to like Shakespeare’s histories
and tragedies more than his comedies
and the critic-constructed ‘romances,’ of
which ‘The Tempest’ is supposed to be the
best example,” Breight said.

Since the actors use the parks and their
surroundings as their stages, costume
designer Lisa Leibering was able to take
a natural approach to incorporating her
own personal style and art into designing
the costumes.

“Because the setting of ‘The Tempest’ is
on a remote island, oftentimes it is tropi-
cal. But given that we are in the park, I
wanted it to be more forest—like. So, I de-
cided to model the costumes from more
Northern Scandinavian islands,” Leiber-
ing said. She used ﬁshing nets and knitted
garments with interwoven patterns for the
costumes. The cast will also incorporate
puppets into the props that they use.

By combining her self—proclaimed
“fantastical magical style,” Leibering said
she has tried to create costumes that show

the dichotomybetween Prospero and his
enemies.

The island inhabitants in the play will
wear costumes with a warm, organic feel,
whereas the enemies of Prospero will be
dressed in a cool color scheme of blues
and blacks with clean lines.

The audience is advised to bring a
blanket and a friend, and, according to
Shakespeare in the Park’s website, “be
prepared for the show to go on in any
weather.”

despite the change in season. S

BARNES’ BURNER

Colunm: Belief in the Pirates shouldn’t waver

Many Pittsburgh sports fans have recently-lost hope in the Bucs. MCT Campus

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

Everyone seems to believe the Pittsburgh
Pirates are bent on falling apart after the
All—Star Break for the second season in a
row, but I am not convinced.

Yes, the Buccos no longer sit atop the
wild card race standings and are now
only ten games over .500, but here’s the
thing: They’re'still in it just as much as
they were when they led one of the wild
card spots a short timeago.

So, let’s touch on a couple points as
to why Pirates fans shouldn’t worry too
much.

First, there’s a flaw within the mindset
of Pirates fans.

Pittsburgh sports fans shouldn’t fret

over the Pirates losing in the same way .

they might if the Steelers or Pens were
to lose a few games.

For example, look at a series in June
against the Baltimore Orioles, in which

the O’s swept the Pirates in Baltimore‘. At .

the time, many began to jump off the Pi-
rates bandwagon and proclaimthe sweep
as the beginning of the end of the Pirates’
season. It wasn’t.

Now, if the Steelers had a three—game
losing streak, there would be reasonable
cause for concern. Three games compose
nearly a_ quarter of the NFL season, and
playoff spots often come down to a dif-
ference of just one game between many,
many teams. ‘

With the Penguins, this tendency to
worry also makes sense. If Sidney Crosby
and Co. lose three in a row, that can some-
times constitute an entire week oflosing.

But in baseball‘, the teams play 162
games: not 16, not 82 ‘— 162. Three
games in a baseball calendar make up
fewer than 2 percent of a team’s entire
schedule.

Fast forward to last week when the San
Diego Padres swept the Pirates. Yes, it’s
August, but the fact that the regular sea-
son is in its penultimate month doesn’t
mean as much as many think.

There are still 32 games left to play.
Last time I checked, that many games is
still a lot of baseball, regardless of what
month it is. .

This leads into my second point’: how
comparing the Pirates’ current play to
their fallout last season is misguided.

On this day last season, the Pirates
held a record of 62-73, 11 games under
.500.

Right now, the Pirates sit at 7o~6o, ten '

games over .500. Comparing the Bucs’
current state to last year’s on this very
day holds no merit. ‘

Last season, the Pirates lost 10 games
in a row from the end of July through the
beginning of August. Since the All—Star
Break, the Pirates’ longest losing streak is
three games. Three games. Not 10. Three.

Overall, the Pirates’ worst losing
streak this season remains five, games,
the result of a couple of series played in
April. Which, again, is nowhere close to
10 games_.

As the 2012 Pitt football season ap-
proaches, the University plans on bring-
ing the school’s student body closer to
the football team than ever before.
The development of the Panther Pitt
means there will be a unified student
section at Heinz Field on Pitt game days
for the first time in several years, and
students buying season tickets have been
given a blue T—shirt to wear at games.

achieve its goal of exciting students for
football season, which include several
events across campus and at Heinz Field

the play.

“This year there’s aislight twist to it,”
Acierno said, referring to the bonﬁre. “At
7:30 p.m. there will be a student picnic
with the football team. We’re going to
have free food, and it will be a really good
social event for the students to come out
and meet the team and see their fellow

RIGHT OFF THE BATKO

Colunm: It’s time to move 0

Brian Batko
Staﬁ” Writer

Can we all just stop talking about
Todd Graham?

I know, I know, I’m technically
being a hypocrite by writing an
entire column on the man who
never stopped talking himself.
It’s dangerously close to the way
everyone seems to tell others to
stop talking about ESPN’s Skip
Bayless, but no one ever does.

When it comes to Bayless, the
best option is to simply ignore
him completely and render his
existence meaningless. Pitt fans,

‘ media and especially the players

need to take a, similar approach
when it comes to former football
head coach Todd Graham.

To be clear, I’m OK with the
potshots such as “Fraud Gra-
ham” and the jeers at his comi-
cally ironic “High Octane” slo-
gan. These now hold a spot in
Pitt athletic lore and can carry
on indeﬁnitely, as far as I’m con-
cerned.

And followers of the program

11 from Todd (graham

absolutely have a right to specu-
late about the transition from the
Graham regime to Paul Chryst’s
reign this season from a football
perspective.

But prodding players to take
verbal jabs at the guy? I wouldn’t
see the point in that. Incessantly
wondering just how little they
thought of his chicanery? I don’t

_ understand that.

I mean, I understand the cu-

' riosity — and everyone loves it

when athletes express how they
really feel -— but in this case, I

_’ think it’s worthless.

EVENTS

for the Panthers’ opener.

“The Pitt student body provides the
heartbeat and the pulse of Heinz Field,”
Borghetti said. “When it is ﬁred up, the
rest of the stadium is ﬁred up.”

Immediately following the football
team’s first game under new head coach
Paul Chryst, there will be ﬁreworks out-
side Heinz Field for students and other
fans to enjoy as they exit the stadium.

The next week, the Panthers will be-
gin their Big East conference schedule
on Thursday, Sept. 6, at Cincinnati, and

the University plans to show the game to

students on a big—screen television on the
Petersen Events Center lawn.

The event will be similar to the one
Pitt hosted two years ago when the Pan-
thers began their season at Utah, but
Acierno said this year’s watch party will
be even bigger, with more free food and
drinks from several local restaurants. Re-
freshments will be available to students
with a Pitt ID.

The Pete lawn will open up at 7 p.m.,
and kickoff in Cincinnati is scheduled
for one hour later.

Pitt lost in overtime at Utah in 2010,
leaving students at the watch party disap-
pointed. But Acierno hopes Pitt will pull
out a victory this time so that the evening
ends on an enjoyable note.

“We’ve got a lot of buzz going around

about Coach Chryst, his staff and the
team,” Acierno said. “Everyone seems to
be extremely excited about what’s going
on right now. Hopefully, it’ll be a great

what they do on a daily basis at practice
so that students can get a different view
of what the student—athlete life is like.”

media is going to be huge in generating
excitement, keeping excitement, keep-

events. It’s a way to reach out to every-
body all at one time, which really makes
movements like this easier.”

With so much going on to get fans
excited about Coach Chryst’s debut sea-
son leading the Panthers, Acierno said
student season tickets sales “have been
going great,” although he wouldn’t name
speciﬁc numbers.

-“We’ve been at every Pitt Start, so I
think most of the freshmen are ready
to go,” he said. “And now that the up-
perclassmen are on campus, sales have
really picked up the last week before the
season starts.”

With expectations for the team and the
student section rising just days before the
season kicks off, Borghetti hopes that a
uniﬁed, more passionate student section
in the corner of Heinz Field will give Pitt a
significant home—ﬁeld advantage this fall.

“Judging from the offseason work the
Panther Pitt has put in, I think this is
going to be an incredibly exciting year
at Heinz Field,” he said. “Not only be-
tween the hash marks, but also in the
stands where our-students will give us
an important home-ﬁeld advantage.” 3

As for discussion on the decrease
in statistical production, it was to be
expected. The numbers put up by the
Pirates’ offense injune andjuly and the
pitching staff in April and May were
incredible. But, at the same time, those
numbers were unsustainable.

During April and May, the Pirates’
hurlers had combined earned run aver-
ages of2.78 and 3.58 and ﬁnished third

 

and sixth in the league those months,
respectively. They also kept men off the
basepaths then, with 1.19 walks-hits per
innings pitched in April and 1.29 in May.

In June and July, the Pirates led or
were close to the top in the league in
nearly every major offensive statistical
category, and they then matched that
astoundilngjune production injuly + a

turnaround from atrocious production

in April and May.
Injune, Pittsburgh scored 146 runs,
hit 39 home runs and posted an on-base

plus slugging percentage of .785. Injuly,
the Pirates put up 130 runs, clubbed
another 39 long—balls and ended the
month with an OPS of .786.

Now we see a majority of players
regressing to their averages, which —
despite how it sounds —— doesn’t neces-
sarily entail anything negative.

' Starting pitcher James McDonald
threw well in his last three starts. An-
drew McCutchen still holds a batting
average of .345, second in the National
League. A.J. Burnett is still an ace and
owns 15 wins so far. A

The Pirates are not out ofit. They
trail a wild card spot by a game. One
game looks really small compared to
33, doesn’t it? .

But hey, don’t take it from me. If fans
want to give up on this team and watch
the Steelers or sit around waiting for
the Penguins’ season to begin, so be it.

But if there were ever a time in the
past 20 years to support your Pirates,
it is now. If there were ever a time to
pack a bar in the South Side or fill u
PNC Park, it is now. '

Fans have waited 19 years to see the
Pirates make the playoffs.

As Pirates manager Clint Hurdle has 8

said, he is.all-in. The Pirates are all-in.
If there were ever a time to go “all in”
in your fandom, it is now.

This season is far from over. And fans
better believe the Pirates are not throw-
ing in the towel. These Pirates are far
too talented and far too hard-working
to quit on the fans and —— _more impor-
tantly — quit on themselves.

Let’s not quit on them. vﬁ

throughout his lone season at the helm,
said to reporters after the Panthers’ sec-
ond training camp scrimmage. “A lot of
times practice was really sloppy  and we
automatically thought it wasn’t going to
carry over toxsaturday and we were going
to be able to make those adjustments, but
it carried over into the game.”

A little bit of an indictment of Graham’s
coaching job last year? Perhaps. But either
way, I really don’t care anymore.

On the subject of his new leader, Chryst,
Sunseri told the media on Tuesday, “He’s
not here to make people laugh or giggle;
he’s here to win football games.” The com-
ment came shortly after Sunseri referred
to'Graham’s system as a “high school of-
fense.”

A thinly veiled dig’ at his former head
coach’s style? Almost undoubtedly. Yet
again, I say, “whatever.”

To an extent, the drama that occurred
last December is a part of the fabric of this
particular team; there’s no denying that.
But let’s leave it as a footnote rather than
a major storyline.

Other than the players recruited by
Graham and his staff who decided to stay
in the program, there won’t be many rem-
nants of the snake oil salesman from Mes-
quite, Texas, in 2012.

When interviewing players at training
camp this month, I often entertained the
idea myself of asking about Graham spe-
cifically: asking what really transpired
between him and his former team or ask-
ing if the upperclassmen that played under
Dave Wannstedt were really as skeptical
about Graham as they had claimed to be
after he left.

Ultimately, though, I decided that
enough was enough. I’m sure the players

. have, for the most part, moved on — at

least I hope they have — and it’s not fair to
them to continue beating that horse. At the
very least, leave those questions for one
day four or five years down the road when
the program is hopefully back on gojod
footing and Chryst is helping it achieve
success in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Maybe they’ll be worth revisiting then.
With Youngstown State and the com-
mencement of the 2012 season just two
days away, ‘turn your focus to the guys
currently in blue and gold. Afterall, there
are certainly enough Grahamsstill on this
team who you can be talking about — spe-
ciﬁcally seniors Ray and Hubie. ' M
