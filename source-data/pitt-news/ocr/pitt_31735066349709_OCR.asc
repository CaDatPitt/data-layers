 CSO Ruling Requires

Commuter Assn. Vote

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The Commuter Association
(CA) Has until July 1 to abide by a
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions (CSO) ruling that would
permit it to maintain its status as a
student organization.

The CSO ruling requires the CA

,f"gld an election of officers with at

least 25 active members present;
CA steering committee member
Tom Pochapsky said the associa-
tion would_ have no trouble
arranging an election meeting
before the July 1 deadline. “If
that's the way to get our money
from the allocations committee,
we’ll do it,” Pochapsky said.
Pochapsky questioned the CSO’s
right to tell the Commuter
Association when to have elections.
He said the association currently
has a steering committee which
transacts business. The CA

‘--~ uonvstitution presently requires

election of officers.

“There is currently an amend-
ment in process to change the
structure of the organization,”
Pochapsky said.

Moye Warns
Frat Leaders
AAbout Gripes

BY CRIS HALL

Fraternity leaders last night
were warned they must ‘take steps
to minimize problems with angry
neighbors or face undesirable
consequences those residents have
the power to cause.

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Alfred Moye told a group of
25 ‘Greeks that failure to resolve
community difficulties could result
in action by the University or the
city to close Bayard . Street
fraternities.

“I think we are at the end of the
line," Moye said. He advised the
Greeks of punitive options avail-
able to the University ranging from
probation to suspension of chap-
ters, and warned “Mayor Flaherty
will sweep the area clean once he
puts his mind to it."

Moye said Bayard residents have
the political clout to close fraterni-
ties by entirely legal means.
Fraternity houses exist in “a
favored situation under a ‘grand-
father clause,’ ” he said, which
exempts them from building and
safety statutes in many instances.

One member of Delta Chi "said
last night local building and fire
inspectors have visited his house
and speciﬁed structural changes

CSO Chairman Hank Kearney
explained although there is no
provision in the CS0 bylaws to take
action against a student organizati-
on for not adhering to its own
constitution, “precedents permit
us to advise that they hold an
election.” _

“There has. to be someone
responsible for financial matters,
and the commuters did not
designate someone responsible, ’ ’ '
Kearney said. Elected officers
would delegate the financial
responsibility, he said.

‘Integrity’ Code Faces Vote A

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The newly revised academic
integrity guidelines—the judicial
review process for persons sus-
pected of violations of the academic
code—will face a vote by the Pitt
Board of Trustees today.

The guidelines have been subject
to an examination by the Academic
Integrity Guidelines Review Com-
mittee since December.

One revision in the code, which
prohibits legal counsel from out-
side Pitt from participating in
academic integrity hearings on the
school level, has received criticism
from student representatives on
the committee.

The section, however, does allow
representatives from within the
university to represent the two
opposing parties.

According to Legal Awareness
Committee Chairman Mike Silver-
man, the procedure puts students
at a disadvantage.

“In a case. where evidence
clearly points to guilt or innocence,
peer counsel is sufficient to,
represent -the student," Silverman
said. “But in a more difficult case,
where facts aren’t clear, a student
must have available to him the
right to obtain skilled extramural
(outside) legal counsel.”

According to Committee Chair-
man and Assistant to the Provost
Ray Steele, the academic integrity
hearings are administrative in
nature, and do not follow the rules
of a court system.

“We’re going into an adminis-*
tration hearing to resolve, not
heighten the conflict,” Steele said.
Steele said he believed lawyers
would complicate the situation.

lines include provisions‘ outlining

PPLJ Appeals Labor Ruling L

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A bid by the Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) to overturn State
Labor Board rulings that lead to the
March faculty union vote may
result in new elections at Pitt. \

The PPU has filed five excep-
tions to ._ rulings related to the
division of faculty for the purposes
of the March vote.

PPU attorneys will argue their
case before the State Labor Board
on J.une 2, claiming the Board
either overlooked,
consider certain evidence in reach-
ing their bargaining unit decisions.

The Board’s original decision

bargaining units, or communities

According to Steele, 58 academic

integrity cases arose in 1975.

o Approximately two-thirds of ‘the

cases were brought up under the

facultyiobligations section of the

guidelines.

According to a memo submitted
by the committee, cases brought up
under the student obligations _

cheating on exams. Types of cases
arising ,under the faculty obliga-
tions section of the code included
charges of unfair grading practices
and improper grading procedure.

The original State decisions also
excluded chairmen as well as V
teaching assistants, teaching fel- -
lows and graduate employes.

The PPU attorneys will argue in,
oral presentations that the original
decision excluding chairmen and

ways in which chairmen are elected
by fellow faculty members and in
which departments traditionally
operate by equal sharing of

Forbes Plaza
Construction

Under Way

BY BOB MAYO

Construction of a plaza between .

Hillman Library and David» Law-

The plaza will lead from Forbes   ii‘ 

Avenue to the new Professional _

Quadrangle and include stairways
to the ‘two older structures,
according to Hunt V. Martin .Jr_.,
director of the University’s Physi-
cal Plant. ‘ A

"‘There will be some trees and

evergreen shrubs like those in front .

of the School of Law," Martin said.
There are no plans _for street‘

furniture other than the seating the '
planters will provide, “but Martin‘

said he believes it eventually will
be added.
The plaza area requires six to

eight weeks of work but may take . ‘ ,

much longer because of needed
steam line installations. s The area
will not open to the public before

however. L

“It would be a pathway the end

prior to the total project's
completion, Martin said.

“We will havean. attractive and 

usable space during the evening as

Martin said, “and there are too few? j ,l

support plans for every school and

The individual department plans
along with the overall Plan make up
the five-year overview, plans for
which were. initiated by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar in 1972. The goal of
the ﬁve-year plan as given in the
mission statement is to give a
long-range view of the University
and set boundaries for decision
making.

Research for the Plan indicates
enrollment will increase only
moderately until 1980 when it will
drop slightly because of decreasing

Frat Leaders Warned

(Continued from Page I’

If all houses were ordered to

tag would drive fraternities out of

Moye also reminded fraternity
leaders their organizations were
not exempt from state drinking-age
laws.

Moye said the University would
not be able to intervene if residents
take steps to, close down fraterni-
ties. “We couldn’t stop them,” he
said. “We don’t have that kind of
clout.” In fact, Moye said, the
University_ has “negative clout” in
issues such as ‘this. '

Moye suggested the fraternities
try to minimize the differences and
meet with residents as one way ‘of

‘avoiding future conflicts with the

Bayard community. 7

Fair to Worse, with Cl Touch of Redemption

BY M.C. PILECKI

There certainly have been a lot
.of ﬂicks ﬂitting around the movie
houses lately.

And there’ are good reasons why
most haven't been staying around.

One ﬁlm that stirred up quite a
bit of criticism was Taxi Driver, ,a
supposed look into the mind of a
political assassin. Robert DeNiro is

‘the title character, an ex-Marin_e \

who leads a dismal, sordid
existence, driving a cab through
the most dismal, sordid sections of

A New York.

,._


L .

.4 He developsa crush on political
campaign worker Cybill Shepherd,
and when he blows the relation-

ship, he decides to kill her
candidate. He goes into training
for -the job, collects quite an

arsenal, grows more radical, _and
keeps a diary (a. la Arthur
Bremmer). Through a quirk,
however, he ends up not an
assassin but a local hero, who has

wiped out a group of pimps in order -

to “save” a 12-year-old prostitute
(Jodie Foster).

The picture is mainly a one-char-
acter show, and there are just too
many ﬂaws in the building up of
DeNiro’s man. The principal one is
ridiculous excesses of the
driver just before he’s ready for the
big killing——he sports a hare
krishna-like haircut that makes no

sense whatever, and just provides
some unexpected and unneeded
comedy. The “climax” is horribly
gory, too—probably just what
modern audiences want.

Surprisingly, there are some
very good supporting performan-
ces, particularly from the women.
Shepherd, in a small but important
part. comes off well, without
seeming like the stuck-up chick she
usually portrays. Most of the
praise, though, has gone to Foster,
who does an astonishing job as the
preteen-aged hooker.

DeNiro contends rather well with
his not-so-well-written character.
It’s not exactly easy to show how a
guy nobody’s interested in tries to
become somebody everybody’s.
interested in.

The same canft be said for

Lipstick, the latest in the rape

' movies. It has that thrown-to-
gether look, like too many
made-for-TV ﬂicks. The story
concerns a fashion model (Margaux
Hemingway) who is raped by her
sister’s music teacher.

She decides to press charges,
and_as expected he gets off. Then
the guy rapes the younger sister,
and gets ‘shot’ for the trouble. A
nice‘ touch, but the ending
completely dilutes any “message”
the movie might have.

Campus Crime Drop

-BY WILLIAM RENKUS

Reported campus crime de-
creased 13% during spring vaca-

gjv-.,t_,_ion and should continue to drop

fhroughout the summer, according
to_ Pitt Campus Police~Chief Curt
Graham. ,

“The statistics are much lower
because we lose 20,000 to 25,000
students over the summer vaca-
tion. Less people equals less
potential victims,” Graham said.

. The crime rate on campus will
probably decrease even more from
April until August. The rate will
increase in September due to the
large number of returning stu-
dents, predicted Campus Police
Lieutenant of Training and Plan-

{Filing Sam Conte.

, i-
.2.

The ‘statistics showed assaults
and other crimes against persons
decreased but property crimes
increased for the first four months
of this year. -

Property theft is the most
prevalentcrime on campus, accor-
ding to Conte. Of some 1950
criminal incidents reported at Pitt
last year, 905 were thefts.

“A lot of people equate theft,
burglary and robbery,” Graham
said. However, he made a

distinction between theft, which‘ is
illegal" taking; burglary, which is
forced entry; and robbery, which is
taking by threat of injury.

Crime occurs most frequently in
the most populated areas on
campus, and more than half of the
thefts could _have been avoided,
Graham said.

“56% of the thefts occured in
unlocked or unattended areas,”
Graham said. Leaving unlocked
dorms or valuables lying around

* can be inviting a criminal, he
added. ‘

There is “no discernable pat-
tern” as to the time of day crimes
occur on campus, according. to
Conte. There are the same number
of assaults day and night.

' Assaults usually occur between
two people who know each other.

Lipstick does present an interest-
ing idea that’s not fully explored-
the fashion model who “sells sex”
also sells herself, for a living. So‘
how can rape be a surprise. Maybe
someone with a little more ﬁnesse
will pick up the idea.

An idea better left lying is The
Bad News Bears, an obnoxious
movie about a band of obnoxious
kids and their obnoxious alcoholic
coach. Walter Matthau plays the
latter, his usual role as a drunken,
slovenly opportunist who turns out
to have a heart of gold.

But the kids! Shirley Temple
may have been too saccharine, but
she was far preferable to this bratty
bunch. Maybe their repugnance
can be understood considering the
ﬁne old American institution in
which they’re "involved: Little
League. If Bears is nothing else,
it’s certainly a harsh indictment of
that “game” that equates sports-
manship with jeering at opponents,
skill with cheating, and the purpose
of the game with winning at any
and all costs.

‘ The ﬂick has one memorable
scene—the championship game.

Both managers (middle-aged men
far past their prime) are berating

sure they feel rotten. ' One of the

“The Oakland area draws people
from all over the city and from

other cities who commit crimes
here,” Graham said. _
The inﬂux of many people to the

_ campus, as on the day ofthe West

Virginia or Notre Dame football
games, presents special problems
for the campus police. On those
days the local population increases
by almost 60,000, but his force has
enough personnel to handle the
situation, according to Graham.

Graham said his department will
use safety informational programs
and preventive patrolling to combat
crime in the‘c‘a‘mpus ‘area.

The purpose of the year-old
safety informational program is to
advise, people on how to avoid
crime and inform them of what to
do if they become crime victims,
Graham said.

The Pitt campus had an overall '

increase in crime last year but it is
less than that experienced by the
city of Pittsburgh, according to
Conte. '

“Most Pittsburgh police believe
the Oakland campus is one of the
safest places ' in Pittsburgh,”
Graham said.

the original story itself is strong
enough to let the ﬁlm leave a
lasting impression. '

The story: A young English.

’Miles), lonely and rather horny,

has a brief affair with American
merchant sailor Jim Cameron (Kris
Kristofferson). They continue to
write after he leaves her village,
and end up in love and wanting to

The main one is the lack of a solid

.70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

 

‘   I ' Assistant Editor.-.: Maggie McKay ,

 

  Return of the Wolf

Two weeks ago we ran an editorial accusing the University of being a

i " ~BigBadWolfthat hadgoneintothe Oakland community and devoured

street after street. We also claimed the University was 

7 -t ’_ substandard housing units in Oaldand. , _
A i ‘ Not long after, we received a call from Vice Chancellor for Public

Affairs Bernard Kobosky who said while the school’s slumlord image

a -~ ‘' was once true, things were getting better. The University, Kobosky
5 V said, was beginning to renovate its apartment complexes. ~

We, looked further into the matter and found the University really
.was improving its properties. In fact, we were hoping the University
ﬁnally had decided to take off the wolf mask. Unfortunately, the more
‘we looked into the matter, the more we realized that beneath the wolf

mask there _.was, in fact, a wolf. . i
V I According to Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance Joseph
. Dutton, Pitt plans to completely renovate its Oakwood apartment
;‘ o '; : ‘building, which contains 18 units on the corner of Oakland and Sennott,
: ~ before the fall’ term.

This, of course, is encouraging, but meanwhile ‘the fate  the
Franklin apa.rtment complex, madeup of seven buildings containing80'

  ‘units, is still undecided. If the University ﬁnds it proﬁtable it will go

ahead and renovate the complex; if it doesn’t, it will either sell it or tear
it down. Until then, however, they will continue to be public eyesore

A ’ -a shame to the Pitt community. ~

The way the University treats it tenants is another cause for shame. -
Pitt has made a commitment to improveits apartment buildings, but

is I has refused to put such commitments into writing. Many of the
— improvements Pitt is making are senseless.

For example, the University insists on renovating the bathrooms in

 1 each unit of the Oakwood complex to include the installation of

showers. The cost for each unit would be $700. The University also

‘has sandblasted the Oakwood complex—which the tenants contend is -
. _ more a cosmetic than substantial improvement. And for $700 a unit,
‘ » ‘they say they could as easily do without the showers.

While rents for the Pitt-owned apartments are lower than rents of
commercially owned buildings, they have been increasing 20% each

  year for the past three years. After the improvements are made, the
 ‘ rents undoubtedly will be higher.

Dutton said since the apartment buildings were purchased as part of

in L’  t the University’s investment portfolio, and the purpose of the purchase
. was to make money for the University, he must run the apartment
’ complexes as he would a business.

I Perhaps that is exactly what is wrong with Pitt’s apartment

H I ; operation-—it is too much a business. The University must remember it

isn’t a business, but an institution of higher learning; a place of

2 _. fenlightemnent. There isnothing wrong with making money for the
. school, but not at the expense of its students, and not at the cost of

degrading the school’s reputation with irresponsible business
practices. ‘A '

The University should decide soon if it is going to renovate or
demolish the Franklin apartmen_t complex. In either case, the sooner
the school goes out of “business” and goes into social responsibility,
the sooner the wolf mask can be discarded:

Please Vote No

Today, the Board of Trustees will vote yes or no on a tuition
increase for Pitt students in the fall. We emphatically ask them to vote
6 I No. I 9 , ’

The University is a state-related school that is supposed to be within
the economic reach of most lower- and middle-class students. Any
further increase will begin to make Pitt affordable only to upper-class
students. Instead of increasing tuition, many areas of the University
budget can be reduced without adversely affecting the quality of
education at Pitt.

In short, we ask the Board of Trustees to reaffirm the University’s
commitment to provide low-cost, high-quality education to
Pennsylvania residents. ~

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

Nobody believes me, but I think my ghost died.
Well, that’s not strictly true; it wasn’t my ghost, but
rather it was the ghost that lived in the attic of my
family’s home, so I guess you’d have to say that it
was my family’s ghost, although I did consider him a
good friend. But like I said, he died. Committed
suicide, I think.

He wasn’t a home-grown ghost, that is, nobody

ever died in the house. I think the ghost originally,

belonged to a ﬁne old Victorian building down the

‘street, and then must have moved into our attic when

his original abode was torn down in 1968. It was
around then that funny things began to happen.
We’d hear noises coming from the attic; things would
disappear or be moved around mysteriously. Whole
bottles of whiskey that we stored upstairs would be
emptied in the course of ‘a night—th_e nights We’d
hear a subdued giggling.

But in the past few months, we hardly heard
anything except an occasional sigh and sob, and it
was about a week ago that there came one, long ﬁnal
scream from the attic. We haven’t heard anything-

i since. The bottle of Jack Daniels we put up there as a

test has remained full, so we ﬁgure he bumped
himself off. ‘

His death has made me realize that most of the
ghosts living in America are pitiable creatures. As
a matter of fact, Americanghosts, as a group, are
vastly inferior to the ghosts of other nations.

In England, for example, ‘ghosts are pretty much
left alone. In a country where many people live in
homes that are more than 500 years old, a ghost need
not worry too much about where he takes up
residence; he can count on not being disturbed or
evicted too often. ' -

But in the United States, where homes more than
50 years old are torn down to make room for parking
lots, low-income housing, or Photomat huts, most

A _ghosts_ﬂon't even bother to unpack because, as

everyone knows, 50 years isn’t that long to a ghost.

Perhaps there seem to be so many more ghosts in ,

, Great Britain because many of the deceased simply

\

hated to leave their beloved surroundings at the time
of their demise. Certainly, the pleasures of Heaven
must be dreary compared to the exciting life of
English nobility in the 14th century; and in Hell, tea

is not always served at four o'clock. On the other ,

hand, most people who die in America are hesitant to
become ghosts because they’re probably very happy
to ﬁnally ﬁndsome peace and quiet.

English‘ ghosts, of course, are much older than
their American cousins. After carefully studying the
matter, I believe ‘ghﬂosts are much like wine: They
improve with age. The Battle of Hastings produced
some fine, ghosts, as did Henry VIII’s unusual
method of divorce. By contrast, the Great American
Ghost is such a miserable speciman of ghostliness
that he wouldn't be allowed into any decent English

ghosts union. (I imagine that, like everybody else in I

Great Britain, the ghosts have unionized too.)

The manner of dying may have something to do
with it. To be beheaded for treasonous acts against
the king, or to be murdered in your sleep seem to be
ﬁne ways'of obtaining ghosthood; to die in an old
folks home or be run over by a Rambler do not.
Americans don't die properly.

Most Pittsburgh ghosts I’ve known havetended to
be a bit boring and low class with the exception of the
ghost in the Cathedral of Learning , who I think is
Frank Lloyd Wright. It was he who 'said that he’d like

to live in the Cathedral, so he’d never have to look at _

It.
There is a ghost of a -hobo that haunts some
railroad tracks in the East End of town, ghostly
teenage girls who died in auto wrecks and many
other ghosts around town, none of whom are‘ worthy
of being a patch on the sheet of any English ghost.
In the end, you really have to feel sorry for this
country’s ghost population. Most of them died in
quieter times‘, and are probably hard put to

understand today's society. The ghost in our attic .
was a good example of this. The year he was forced a

out of his original home, 1968, was the year of
miniskirts, assassinations, race riots and general
upheaval. All of a sudden, our ghost became a
refugee in a world he didn’t understand.

As more old buildings are torn down, I think we’ll A
see.more ghosts" taking up residence in new homes. -
So, if you end up missing things, if objects get moved -

around inexplicably and if things go bump in the
night, search your home. Behind old boxes, stacks_of

, magazines, or in your attic or basement, you may

ﬁnd a cowering ghost afraid tofacethe, rapid changes

‘ pf. thefmodern world. And who could blame him?

Paperback, $2.25, 400 pages

In high school libraries across
the land, buried beneath ominous

lies a pleasant diversion to they

but always ‘frank estimate of

The philosophy of the Insiders.’
Guide is that there is more to
colleges than classes and books.
“College,” the book says, “is a
time for you to stick your toe in the
Olympic-size swimming pool of life
before you take that ﬁnal shivering
plunge.” Therefore, the Insiders
Guide covers such things as the
social mentality of each school,
school reputation, living conditi-

what kind of sex ‘life you can

of colleges to be found. M

The proﬁles also make for
interesting reading. First of all,
the Insiders’ Guide hated Penn
State, despised Duquesne, didn’t
mention WVU, and pretty much
liked Pitt. This alone is worth the
price of the book.

About Penn State it said: “If you’
don't mind living" in conditions
reminiscent ‘of ratholes, and if you
are amenable to an intellectual

‘climate that would have been

stimulating to Babbitt, Penn State
might be for you.”

Even Kate Smith couldn’t save
the Philadelphia Flyers.

Reggie Leach couldn’t do it,
Wayne Stephenson couldn’t do it
and even the great Bobby Clark
couldn’t do it. So when Kate Smith
failed to come through, no one was
surprised. ‘ ‘

Down 3-zip and depressed going
into game four, the Flyers had to
dig deep for their secret weapon.
With Clarke ailing-he is set to
undergo knee surgery now that the

on the heroics of Leach. He
blasted in a surprising 61 regular

equally astounding 19 in the
playoffs to. break Phil Esposito’s
seemingly unbreakable total of 79
goals in one year, including the

The Pittsburgh Triangles are a
paradox this season. At home, the
team is undefeated in matches and
sets, while they are winless on the
road.

' Last week was no different as the
Triangles defeated Ilie Nastase and
the Hawaii Leis, 31-20, before
5,176 at home and lost ‘to Billie
Jean King and the New York Sets
in "New York, 26-16, putting the
Triangles 3-3 in third place, behind
New York and Cleveland. ‘~

In Saturday's New York match,
the Triangles singles’ participants
rallied and won, but all three
doubles‘ teams lost.

Nancy Richey Gunter, substitut-
ing for ailing Evonne Goolagong,
crushed aitough Virginia Wade,
6-2," after she and Peggy Michel
lost to Wade and King, 6-0, in the
opening set. I

Vitas Gerulaitis’ win over Sandy
Mayer was a lot closer, as he won
7-6, including a 5-4 tiebreaker.

made his much-anticipated Pitts-
burgh premiere.

Taking second billing was his
team, the Hawaii Leis.$

The" 7-5 win by Gerulaitis over
Nastase was the evening’s high-
light. Both played superb tennis,
with each returning on almost
unreachable volleys. But Gerulaitis
was the one who concentrated
more on the set and didn’t clown
around. He won and earned a
standing ovation.

’Nastase’s problem was that he
let his emotions and clowning take
away from his game. Who else
could get into verbal arguments
with the 5,000 fans, acuse a
linesman of cheating, hit balls
intentionally at the stands and
make numerous off-color gestures
that could cause Goolagong and
Michel to cover their eyes? .

The evening’s ﬁnale was the
post-match interview with Nastase
that was as colorful as an erupting
volcano.‘ He ironically criticized the
crowd's rowdy behavior. (Then
again, it was hard to‘ tell who was
more vulgar, Nastase or the

crowd.) ' He also’, criticized the

‘The Phoenix Suns, who have not
made the National Basketball
Association playoffs since 1970,
Sunday secured a spot in the 1976
ﬁnals by defeatingthe defending
NBA champion -Golden State
Warriors, 94-86, and capturing the

seven game semiﬁnal series, four -
' games to three.

Paul Westphal and ,Garﬁeld
Heard, a pair of traveled veterans
who came to the Suns in off-season
trades, sparked the upset'victory
with 21 points apiece, while NBA
rookie of the year Alvin Adams
added 18 points and 20 rebounds.

All-pro forward Rick~ Barry had

The reserve guard, Westphal,

developed into one of the league’s

format of World Team Tennis
(WTT) and gave insight on his
decision to sign with WTT.

Q: “Why did you sing with
WTT?’.' ,

A: “I don’t know. That's a really
good question.”

Nastase later complained, “It’s
unfair that the fanslcan scream and
boo. We can’t even complain. If we
do, we get ﬁned and the crowd
doesn’t...If this crowd’ wanted to
see a professional circus, I let them
see one because I’m a professional
at it. The crowd just wanted to see
a show and_ not good tennis."

On WTT, he said, “In WTT, you -

only get a chance to play one set of,

say, men’s singles. In tournament

tennis, you play more than one set.

So if you do badly in the ﬁrst set.

you get a chance to come back in.
the second set...It's hard to get
used to this format."

Lei player-coach Butch Buchholz
insisted Nastase is really a nice
guy. “I've had no clashes with him.
He has great team spirit. He's
enthusiastic. Plus, he practices
really hard. He makes a great

"destined to take the Cup home. As
they often do, the Canadiens were
matching the Flyers stride for
stride and waiting to bury them in
the end.

After exchanging second period
goals by Andre “Moose” Dupont
of the Flyers and Montreal’s
captain Yvan Coumoyer, the two
teams began a classic third-period
struggle.

In one corner was the Philadel-
phia Flyers--the first expansion
team ever to capture Lord Stanley’s
silver cup, the first team to repeat
as champions since the 1968-69
Canadiens and the defending
champion trying to ward off an
embarassing elimination.

The Flyers had made it to the
ﬁnals without their strongman--
goalie Bernie Parent, who has
tantalized the league with his
skillful netminding ‘for several
years. Parent had won the Conn
Smythe trophy in each of the
Flyers’ championship years.

NOW With replacement Stephen-
son in goal, Philadelphia had its
chance to prove it was indeed a
team and not Clarke and Parent
and 16 other guys.

In the other corner _was the
Montreal Canadiens--the New York

most respected offensive players
last year with the Boston Celtics.
He came to the Suns along with a

second round draft pick, who.

. turned out to be Ricky«Sobers, who
stepped into the starting lineup
replacing the injured Dick Van
Arsdale. - ' ‘

Heard was obtained from the
Buffalo Braves that sent highly
regarded forward John Shumate
away. Phoenix general manager
Jerry Colangelo then _traded for
veteran rebounding forward Curtis
Perry to round out his make-shift
lineup.

The Suns, victors in the Western
Conferences semiﬁnal series, are
now waiting for a champion to
emerge from the NBA eastern
"series. '

In that series, the Boston Celtics
took a three to two’ game series lead
over the upstart Cleveland Cava-
liers with a 99-94 win on Sunday.

The'Celtics were hoping to coast
through the game, without the
services of star forward John
Havlicek, who has been sidelined
with leg injuries. But after blowing
