Former University of Pittsburgh
walk-on football player John Evans
has filed suit against Dante Wiley,
Quintin Jones and the University of
Pittsburgh, claiming he suffered in-
juries during a Pitt football practice
that ended his football career and left
him without full use of his left arm.

Jones, a junior from Pompano
Beach, Fla., is a defensive back and
leads the Panthers in interceptions
with three.

Wiley, a 6-2, 200—pound native of
Jeannette, transferred to the Univer-
sity of Nebraska from Pitt in late
August 1985 after he was ‘declared
academically ineligible. He spent
one full season with the Panthers.

Evans, now an assistant football
coach at Avonworth High School,
declined Wednesday to comment on_
the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday
in common pleas court.

The incident in question occurred
on Oct. 10, 1984. Evans, a receiver
at the time, was taking part in a con-
trolled non-contact drill in the out-
field grass of'Pitt’s baseball field.

The Panthers regularly practice

wherever they are," said Reagan.
"No one said it would be a quick
fix.” '

In the documentary entitled A
Generation At Risk, Reagan tells us,
"Young people today are facing the
‘errifying specter of drug and alcohol
abuse. But something can be
done."

At a luncheon co—sponsored by
WQED-TV and the Chemical People
Institute, Reagan paid tribute to those
/vho are doing something about the

problem of drug abuse. In attendance

were representatives of various task_

forces that have been__established
throughout Pennsylvania, including
Chemical_People Institute and the
Coalition for Addictive Diseases.

Blue Cross President Eugene
Barone presented Chemical People
Institute with a $25,000'check from
Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The
money will be used to support task
forces in western Pennsylvania. The
presentation is the first time the
private sector has made such a con-
tribution.

Oakland business leaders met with
representativesjfrom the city council
and the city police yesterday to
discuss last weekend's incidents of
crime and violence in the downtown
Oakland area. .

"These kids are having a picnic in
Oakland. I saw some people take a
purse and jog away smiling. Not run,
jog,” Peter LeVintis, the owner of
Peter's Pub, said to open the meeting.

”Employees aren't showing up'for
work, they're getting mugged on the
way to their jobs. People are afraid
to stay open late,'’ LeVintis said.

Last weekend, eyewitnesses
reported dozens of high-school-age
people crowding the intersection of
Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street.
Campus police reported five arrests,
and eight students reported incidents
of robbery and assault.

"it's a zoo out there, a "war zone.
I can see this blowing up into a full-
scale race riot if things continue the
way they are. It's going to be the kind
of thing we saw in the ’60s," said
Mark Depasquale, _a representative of

2 an Oakland community organization.

Pittsburgh Police Commander
Joseph Wind countered, ’’I don't
agree with that at all. I can't see that
happening here.”

Most of the discussion centered on
the perceived lack of police protec-
tion for the businesses in the Oakland
a'rea. Wind maintained that the pro-

Senate to approve
loan crackdown

WASHINGTON —— Congress is a
step away from final passage of a bill
which would crack down on student
loan deadbeats, but increase govern-
ment aid to part-time students.

_ Under the measure, students
receiving government loans or grants
would be required to achieve a ”C”
average by the end of their
sophomore year in order to continue
receiving the financial help.

The bill has already passed the
House by a wide margin and is ex-
pected to easily pass the Senate
sometime soon.

The bill would allow part-time
students to begin receiving Pell grants
in 1989, make students under the age
of 24 prove they are financially in-
dependent of their parents in order
to receive any aid and suspend loan
repayments for up to two years for the
unemployed.

Evangelist may have

WASHINGTON —— An ex-Marine
friend of TV evangelist and possible
presidential candidate Pat Robertson
claims Robertson used his political
influence to avoid combat duty in
Korea.

According to John Gearhart, he,
Robertson and two other Marine
lieutenants were on a boat headed for
Korea when Robertson made a
phone call to his father, Willis Robert-
son, a Democratic senator from

‘Virginia.

The men were suddenly assigned
to a base in Japan.

Robertson denies ever using his in-
fluence to avoid combat duty and
said he went ”where he was ordered
to go.”

Gearhart also said Robertson was
latertransferred to Korea, but did not
”go anywhere near the front lines.’’
The other Marines with Gearhart on
the trip backed up his story, saying
they all understood they were pulled

House passes historic
reform bill

WASHINGTON —— The House
passed a historic tax reform bill
Thursday, paving the way for Senate
approval of the measure next week.

Sources said the measure should
pass easily, and President Reagan has
said that he would sign a tax reform
bill if it reached his desk.

Earlier, House members staved off
a last-ditch effort to kill the measure,
rejecting a motion that would have
sent the bill back to a House and
Senate Conference Committee.

Sources said that the compromise
whichienabled the measure to pass
was a proposal that would allow
fewer tax breaks in exchange ' for
lower tax rates.

Marchers making
two-day pitstop
at Schenley Park

en route  

By Christopher Sepesy
For The Pitt News

For months they have gone without
the comforts of a real home. For the
next few days they will be setting up
camp in Schenley Park, a way station
in their quest for global nuclear
disarmament. -

They are all participants in The
Great Peace March, a cross-country
trek from Los Angeles to Washington,
D.C. The goal of the marchers is to
inform the public of the dangers of
escalating nuclear defense tech-
nology.

”Our main purpose is education
and education alone,” said marcher
Bruce Bishop. ”We’re not marching
for Reagan. What our main’ focus is,
our primary intention is, to reach out
to the American public and connect
and educate. But we do hope Reagan
listens.”

The march itself is an offspring of
ProPeace, a similar campaign which
went bankrupt in March of this year
after only a year of existence.

The present march started in Los
Angeles after members of the original
march decided not to let the mission
itself fail. Since then, it has received
thousands of backers, including
celebrities such as Paul Newman,
Barbara Streisand and Senator Gary
Hart of Colorado.

The march is in Pittsburgh until
Saturday. It will be in New York on
Oct. 14, Philadelphia on election eve
and end in Washington, Nov. 15.

The main criticisms of the march
are that it resembles too closely the
radical groups of the '60s and that the
cause it is promoting is not founded
on a solid basis. When asked of this,
‘Bishop replied, ”Some people think
we are just throwbacks from the ’6_Os.

to D.C.

I do not agree. You would be sur-
prised [at] just how much support
we're getting from the American peo-
ple. We project the idea that if you
don't get involved, you may get in-
cinerated. That isn’t pure '60s, but at
least those fires still burn.”

Bishop also commented on the di-
versity of the group. ”We have peo-
ple from all over the country, all
walks of life. Some people left very
high jobs to do this.”

One of these people is Bob Alei,
31, of San Francisco. Alei, an elec-
trical engineer, left a staff research
position with Hughes Aircraft to work
on organizing the march.

’’I just looked into my heart and
found that I don't want to be here to
promote killing,” said Alei. ”From
now on I will actively oppose and
work against any activities promoting
war.”

Alei said he felt his knowledge of
nuclear activity was vast until he
started to investigate some of the
criticisms against it. Since his involve-
ment in the march, he feels more
capable and powerful in addressing-
and combating the issue. But he said
it cannot stop there.

’’It is incredible how little people
know about the issue and staggering
how uninvolved they are. But once
they do know and do get involved,
it's shaking just how much they can
do. Many of our own people have
found this out.”

Irma Adame, of Fresno, Calif.,
joined the march one month ago in
Chicago. Since then, she has been an

‘active worker in the march. L

”We have such a good cause,”
said Adame, ”People must know this.
We are here to reach out and talk to
people, to let them know about this

_d_an_ge_r that could._destroy our planet

if it goes too far. And if it does,'it will
be all our own fault for lettingit get
that way. We will be the ones to
blame.”

Both Bishop and Alei feel this way
as well, and both are alarmed by the
current stand-tough policies being
implemented by the Reagan admin-
istration. In addition to this, they feel
these same policies are being spoon-
fed to the nation via popular media
and entertainment forms.

’’I really do believe this administra-
tion is purposelybuilding more and
more weapons in order to have the
counter-force [first strike] advantage.

said Bishop.

Alei added, ’’I really don't think he
[Reagan] believes in disarmament. In-
stead of a peaceful or even diplo-
matic way to do things he feels a

one. This means bigger and better

When will it stop? A

"Pitt fired Foge Fazio as head football coach last November. When

volving football players and the negativepublicity the University of
Pittsburgh was receiving because of its football program — so we

For the past two years, incident after incidentwas reported by the
media concerning Pitt football players. When Mike Gottfried tdok
over as head coach in December, the incidents seemed to stop. But

i » we still feel the aftershock of Fazio’s regime. The university has

opened itself up to criticism again. Maybe we should not ask when
will it stop? Instead, we should ask if it will ever stop.

Listen to Nancy
and ”just say no”

Our first lady, Nancy Reagan, in her recent visit to the most liveable
city in the nation, suggested that people ”just say no." In her effort
to rid the nation of its drug problem, she launched her own crusade
against what some people have deemed ”a crisis.”

Since the deaths of basketball star Len Bias and professional foot-
ball player Don Brown, the hottest issue in politics has been that of
substance abuse. There is a frenzy in Washington concerning the
dramatic increase of people using illegal drugs. But are more people
really using drugs, or is there more awareness? The Sept. 29 issue
of US News and World Report states that ”reliable data show some
forms of drug use declining, while others have remained flat. Only
cocaine use, particularly in a potent new form known as crack, is

up.” So, to answer the above question, drug usage is probably no

‘more than it was before the deaths of highly visible stars such as Bias.

It was no surprise that these deaths triggered the anti-d rug war which

' we are experiencing now and will experience in the years to come.

President Reagan had called for $894 million to be used in the crack-

' down on illegal substances. This money will be used both domestical-

ly and in efforts like those currently taking place in Columbia to stop
drugs at the source. -
The Pitt News applauds the steps being taken to lessen the drug

. problem in our nation. The ”just say no” campaign with Nancy

Reagan at the helm is gaining popularity and a growing number of
-followers. The concept of this campaign is simple — just say no. It

A I is a movement to help those most vulnerable to thepressures our

society imposes to experiment with drugs: the children.
Mrs. Reagan is currently making a nationwide sweep to let her
message be known. Her husband is allocating funds to back up and

enhance her efforts. He's also calling for extensive drug testing pro-.

grams to be implememted in the name of traditional American values.
. Nancy Reagan is not the only first lady to make an effort to fight
substance abuse. Betty Ford, a former abuser herself, lent her name

‘ and her energy to establishing The Betty Ford Clinic, which has

become one of our country's most successful detox clinics. She is
a living example that it is never too late. The only difference between
Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Reagan is that Mrs. Reagan is trying to stop the
problem before it happens.

Her point is clear. She said while in Pittsburgh, ”The next step [after
the realization of a drug-problem] is to make people take a stand."
It is no longer cool to be messed. Why not be ‘cool and just say no?

Blacks are not to blame
LETTERS-

My name is Donald Frazier, and I
am a black student at the University
of Pittsburgh. I must say that the
reason I felt compelled to write this
letter stems from a sense of concern
and responsibility to my people.

First, I would like to say that I am

- truly sorry for the criminal incidents

which occurred to Pitt students on
Forbes Avenue this weekend. How-
ever, I have to admit that when I read
the numerous articles of white
students testifying to the media, say-
ing that ”some black guy did this”
and ”a black girl did that,” and (this
is the big one) they quoted, /‘over
100 black youths clogged up Forbes
Avenue, jumping on top of cars and
robbing Pitt students,” I didn't know
whether to laugh or cry. I am not
ashamed to admit I did the latter
because it tears my heart out to see
black youths being so unproductive.
However, I don't blame the youth, I
blame the environment - more
specifically, the city of Pittsburgh.
The city of Pittsburgh acknowledges
the fact that there is a problem but
refuses to take positive action to pre-
vent such a disheartening reoccur-
rence. It should be known to city
officials that throwing black youths
into paddy wagons is not a positive
action, regardless of what some racist
would have you believe. Yes, there
is a problem with youth violence in
the city of Pittsburgh. However, the
way to rectify this problem is to in-
vestigate it first. For instance, if you
talk to black youths (yes, talk to them)
on the Hill, you will find that they
dislike this city. Why? Well, allow me
to give a brief synopsis of the situa-
tion as it is: This is a city that lacks
adequate recreational facilities for in-
ner city youths; a city which lacks a
multitude of organized sports for
youth; a city whose weekend enter-
tainment for youths is inadequate; a
city which bans from the radio sta-
tions Rap music which they love so

- much, a city in which the high school

students lack adequate college prep
programs; and last but not least, a ci-
ty that simply refuses to address the
needs of its black youth. P

So obviously they feel oppressed.
No, they don't realize that they are
under emotional stress, but they do
know that they feel a need to express
themselves, and this is what comes

out of it: the creation of gangs, anger -

and violence. This is the negative
way in which they express them-
selves. The city of Pittsburgh must
realize that it has an obligation to its
youth. It must contribute to produce
a more positive, stimulating environ-
ment with the proper resources to
produce positive results. So you can
either invest in the productivity of to-

day's youth, or you can expect more
of the same incidents that occurred
‘this past weekend. To put it even
plainer, you get out of it what you put
into it, and the city of Pittsburgh
hasn't put a damn thing toward help-
ing the black youth of the Hill!

I would like to respond to some ‘

comments printed recently in The Pitt
News regarding the recent outbreaks
ofviolence in Oakland. To be blunt,
several of the persons quoted implied
racist attitudes in their emphasis on
the races of the persons involved.
Granted, there was violence commit-
ted by blacks against whites. Never-
theless, some people need to have
pounded into their heads (and I hope
not literally pounded) that a person's
dark skin does not naturally compel
them to commit anti-social acts.
Events such as the Oakland violence,
and that which occurred downtown
after the Run—DMC concert, are the
results of an unfair social and
economic situation, in which many
black youths are trapped. Increasing
police activity will do ‘nothing to
solve this basic problem. One small

step toward progress would be for

more people to realize that the per-
sons who acted violently are just as
fully human as anyone else.

All this talk about black crowds on
Forbes Avenue has really got me boil-
ing. Before anyone says that I don't
know what I'm talking about, I was
there. The crowd was primarily high
school-aged, some of whom were in-
vited down by college students.
David Cercone, in his letter to The
Pitt News (Wednesday, Sept. 24,
1986), asked for a no-loitering policy.
Does this policy include or exclude
the dozens of Pitt students who con-
gregate nightly in front of C.J.'s, the
‘O’ and Zelda's? David seems to
forget that Forbes is a public street,
i.e., not for Pitt students only.
Residentsrof the city of Pittsburgh
have as much, if not more, right to
be there than Pitt students. Sure, as
a Pitt student, I sympathize with
David. After all, I too have experi-
enced frustration at that corner, but
as a lifelong resident of the city, I
must admit that I resent the implica-

tion that city residents should change -

their way of life to accomodate a

crowd of people who won't be
around any longer than it takes to
complete 120 credits. David seems
to be asking for some sort of distinc-
tion between city people and college
students. David, if you wanted to be
in. an area where there are only
students, you should have gone to
some extremelyisolated rural col-
lege. You made your bed, now lie in
it! ‘

However, loitering doesn't seem to
be the main issue here. The remark
made by Debbie Rummel-and the 12
eyewitnesses to Saturday's incident
seemed to indicate race as a major
issue. That is ridiculous, unnecessary
and unfair. Do these same people
who feel fear when walking in the
vicinity of black people feel the same
fear when confronted by a white per-
son with spiked hair [and] wearing
tire chains? More than likely, no. It
appears to me that the most frighten-
ing thing about [the] Saturday inci-
dent "was that there were black
people involved, These people, did
they also witness white youths throw-
ing beer bottles into the street at cars
on the corner of Forbes and Bouquet?

Another item of interest is that the
[campus] police say that there is
nothing they can do. That is correct.
There is nothing that you can do with
a lazy bunch of men who would
rather sit around and watch than
become involved.

The bottom line is this: Stop mak-
ing this an issue of race. Admit that
there is a problem, and try to solve
it, both blacks and whites working
together. Believe me, it can be done.

Women's roles

’’I am so confused! I mean, these
women want to be intellectual equals
and chivalrized maidens and sex toys
— how's a guy supposed to under-
stand them?” That's the essence of
Paul Anater’s complaint in his
”Ha|ftime Sex Shows” column on
Wednesday, Sept. 24. "How about
a little consistency ladies? Pick one
of your roles, and stick to it," he
whines. , '

Hey mister, men are allowed to
wear multiple hats — to be intellec-
tuals and gentlemen and desirable
creatures at the same time. Why ex-
pect women's roles to be simpler? If

human females are truly too com- ’

plicated for you, Mr. Anater, may I
suggest that you hang out with
creatures you can understand —’ like
maybe amoebas?

I have never been one to live life
in the fast lane. While other people
wear designer clothes from Italy, I
stick with jeans and Weejuns. While
other people go from sushi to pasta
to the next food trend, I stick with
cheeseburgers. While other people
strive to drive BMWs and Mercedes,
I hail cabs.

But, until about 10 years ago, there
was something in my life that I
though was pretty razzmatazz.

I chewed Clove gum.

Now, nobody else chewed Clove
gum. I knew thisfor a fact because
I would go to the grocery store and
there would be all of the packs of
Clove gum, in their shiny orange

wrappers, in the Clove gum box. I.

would select a pack. When I would
return to the store a few days later,
all the remaining packs of Clove gum
would still be in the gum box. No
one else would have removed an-
other pack. This.would go on for
weeks on end.

Apparently. the manufacturers of .

Clove gum got the message. Some-

marriage can stay and grow. I am not
saying that sensual pleasure must go
away. It need not, and it can increase
amazingly with the years.

But that wild, thrilled sense of be-
ing rewarded beyond all expectation,
beyond deserving, as if wishing really

that belongs to the beginning of a
marriage - to the courtship and to
the honeymoon (however long that
peri_od lasts).

As a Pitt student, you have no

the ethereal look to symbolize their

"Gorbachev has eaten Reagan

Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national
security advisor under the Carter ad-
ministration, describes well the poor,
slow and inane handling of the en-
tire Daniloff incident by the Reagan
administration.

Nicholas Daniloff, the U.$.News
and World Report correspondent ar-
rested by the KGB on Aug. 30, 1986,
has beenaccused by the Soviets of

spying for the United States and of at-‘

have said, ”There’s this one guy out
in the Midwest who still chews Clove
gum, but he's the only customer we
have left.” Because one day I re-
turned to the grocery store and the
Clove gum was gone. I asked the
manager why, and he said, ”I think
they stopped making it.” I checked
at drugstores and cigar stands. No
Clove gum.

This depressed me, of course.
Chewing Clove gum had been the
one daring thing in my life. But I
switched to Wrigley’s Spearmint and
Doublemint, and figured I would
never see Clove again.

But now ~— miracle of miracles ——
I have learned that, for a limited time,
Clove is coming back.

The Warner-Lambert Co. — whose
American Chicle Group produces
chewing gum — has announced that
starting in October, three of its old-
fashioned brands will return to the
marketplace for three months only.
The brands are Black. Jack, Beemans
and Clove.

that is the kind of thing you overhear
him saying, when he doesn't know

old three brands. We did it quietly —
no announcements."

Black Jack, according to Molloy, is
116 years old. Beemans has almost
as. long a history. And Clove? Clove
has a story I was unaware of.

”Clove was introduced in the
19305, just as Prohibition was re-

pealed," Molloy said. ’-’It was pro-.

moted as ‘the gum that takes your
breath away’ and was sold in drink-
ing establishments. People would
chew it in an attempt to hide the
smell of alcohol on their breath.”
During this last decade in which
Clove and the other two brands have
been missing, Warner-Lambert has
put most of its efforts into promoting
Trident, a sugarless gum. ”The sugar-
less market is the largest gum market
now,” Molloy said. "Trident is a
$100 million-a-year brand for us.”
‘Nevertheless, he said, there has
been a steady trickle of mail to
Warner-Lambert during the last 10
years, asking what has happened to
Clove, Black Jack and Beemans. ”Not
a lot of mail," Molloy said. ”Maybe

a friend, and that you would not en-

much reassurance.

The Krishnas refrain from sex, even
after marriage, unless it is for the crea-
tion of a ”God-knowing child." The
devotees feel that if they have not
achieved understanding of Krishna,
they would be incapable of raising a
child well. The maitre d’ later told us
that most people don't achieve that
plateautill late in life. This would
seem to preclude having a child in
the years when the parents are young
enough to relate to the child's needs.
It seems cruel to subject a child to a
life with parents too far removed from
their own youth to understand the
child. Call me old-fashioned, but I
think a child, regardless of faith,
deserves more than that.

from his prison cell to his apartment
in Moscow, provided that he remain

trial is held. At the same time, the
U.S. released Zakharov to the Soviet
Embassy on the condition that he re-
main within 15 miles of the Soviet
Embassy and await trial. Secretary of
State George Shultz said that there
was no relation between the two
releases, but this becomes very dif-
ficult to believe when one considers
that the two releases took place
within 30 minutes of each other.

Reagan administration give in? If
Reagan does decide to trade Daniloff
for Zakharov, then the current game
will continue. The Soviets will seize

If Reagan plays hardball with the

(instead forcing the trade of Zakharov

realize that the illegal seizure of in-

soggy ending

_. ..,. .v-

. By Phillip Rhodes
For The Pitt News

Every Wednesday evening around

' 6:30 p.m., the Pittsburgh Zoo lower

.parking lot is transformed from a
mere parking lot to a racetrack for
cyclists.
Usually anywhere from 20 to 40
' cyclists show up on any given week.
The last race of the season ended
with a sigh of relief from both the
organizers and racers on Sept. 24.
’’It will be nice to have a break
from running the race every week
since it's a lot of effort to put the race
on,” said David Eaton, race director
and president of the Allegheny
Cycling Association which sponsors
the event.
The end of the season means

‘ T much-needed rest from the vigorous

~ hours of training and special diets.
”Now I can get fat over the winter
again,” said Pitt mathematics major
Dan Chew, winner of the race.
Chew, 25, won his sixth race of the
season Wednesday night, insuring
him a third Allegheny Cycling
Association's ”Club Champion” title.
He is Pittsburgh's only professional
bicycle racer. After placing 12th at
the U.S. Philadelphia Pro Road Race
""85, ‘he received sponsorship from

 Z ..;-Pittsburgh Pro and Cadence Manage-

-ment Consultants. This enabled him
. to go back again this year and place
25th against an international field of
120. A
Only four cyclists decided to race

on the parking lot’s .6-mile loop last‘

Wednesday.

Rodgers, Jay Wolkoff and Angelo
‘ Cialone showed up but the majority

; A road last Wednesday even the most
.._..e,Xp.erienced cyclists didn't go
‘ through the turn at more than 24

mph. This turn is the most difficult

part of the course for inexperienced
cyclists. When a cyclist crashes go-
ing around this bend he can easily
cause everyone else to wreck.
Cyclists must ride close behind the
bike in front of them without hitting
its wheel. This is called ”drafting.”

Whenever someone hits the wheel
in front of them, he usually crashes,
causing the people behind him to
crash and resulting in a chain reac-
tion of wrecks.

Fortunately, this rarely occurs at the
Wednesday night races. People not
familiar with bicycle racing often
wonder why racers ride so close to

the people in front of them when it's .

so dangerous.

When a racer is drafting someone,
he is working 20 percent less than the
person in front of him, because the
person up front has to work against
the wind while the person behind is
protected from the wind. Drafting
plays a key role in the races at the zoo
parking lot.

Racers try to form ”breakaways”

and work together fighting the wind

by taking turns up front, in a process
called “pulling.”
Last Wednesday Dan Chew broke
away alone with 8 laps to go to win.
The racing season was hindered
this year by a law requiring hardshell
helmets and an United States Cycling
Federation license to race.
According to Eaton, president of
the ACA, these laws discouraged
about a quarter of the last year's
racers from racing again this year.
”The laws were good for the sport

of cycling because they made it a A

safer sport,” said Eaton.

Chew, a three time club champion
for the ACA, said he agreed with the
helmet law because he has always
worn a helmet, even before the law
was made. ‘

”Before the law came into effect,
I stood out of the crowd like some
kind of geeky tourist,” Chew said.
”Now that everyone has to wear one,
I’m taken more seriously by my com-
petitors because now everyone looks
like a geeky tourist.” .

 Reorganization of.
 Catlott SCl1aO0‘fIi
proceeds smoothl
according to clean:

' By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

In November 1984, a report was
leaked from the Office of the Provost
that accused most of the faculty of the
School of Education of being ”dead
wood." The controversy surrounding
the leak and the numerous apologies
following it marked the beginning of
a major reorganization for the educa-
tion department.

The first step of that reorganization
is now complete with the merging of
15 education departments into two
institutions and three departments.
School of Education Dean Thomas
LaBelle said the faculty response he
has received has been good so far.

”The moves were the result of the
new programs,” LaBelle said. "They
[the moves] went quite well, they
were well _organized. I don’t'recall
any faculty member writing me a
complaining letter.”

According to LaBelle, there were
some problems with the technicali-
ties of the move, complicated by the
installation of the new phone system
at the same time, but "those pro-
blems were inevitable, the faculty
members took it in stride,” he said.

The major criticism in the initial ,

report in 1984 was that there was a
low level of scholarly production
among the faculty members. Dean
LaBelle hopes to change that situa-
tion with an increased emphasis on
a ”greater balance between instruc-

tion and research.”

”The faculty must be‘ consumers as 
well as contributors to.the literature] 7
in their field of study,” Labelle said, '
He was quick to point out, though, 
that there would be an ”increase,ini 
the research done, but without slack- 
ing off on the quality of instruction.” f ‘ti;

”All faculty members should pur-I-_L_ 
sue personal intellectual growth .to 
become better instructors,” LaBelle; A 
continued. ”We want to give the [__
students a chance to study in the 
- presence of faculty committed 'to7‘l~_f
growth in their field. That's what puts gs... 

us above most of the other institu-
tions‘in the area.” "

The school presently has »122_ 1,
tenure—track faculty members, 50-1 00,’ 
staff people and 2400 students, ac‘.-'
cording to LaBelle. The budget in- .
cludes $8-9 million from -the 
university as well as $3-4 million’ 
from outside sources, including  *
research grants, scholarships and out- . " '

side programs within the school.

The school also runs a number of. 
assistance programs that interface 
with the local community. A large 
portion of the money in the depa_rt- 
ment now goes to these programs, V 5
but LaBelle said he hopes to increased ‘ '
the amount of scholarly output ‘ ,
without cutting into the existing 

programs. .
”We want the faculty to contribute
not only statistics from their research,

but to contribute new questions in ‘ 

their fields,” LaBelle said.

THE PITT NEWS

Soccer team 5-0,
but powerful OSU
to provide

By Teresa Varley

For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team is about to find
out how tough they are. After jump-
ing out to a 5-0 start, the Panthers
have their most difficult test of the
season this Sunday as they travel to
Ohio State.

The Buckeyes are 5-1-1, with vic-
tories over Kentucky 1-0, Morehead
State 7-0, West -Virginia 2-O,
Louisville 2-1 and Indianapolis 4-0.
Their only loss came at the hands of
the 15th-ranked Indiana Hoosiers,
and they tied Northwestern 2-2-in
double overtime.

”Ohio State will be a whole new
game for us,” said Pitt coach Joe Lux-‘
bacher. ”They are a very tough team.
It's not going to be easy, but I think
our players will rise to the occasion.
We need to play solid soccer for 90
minutes to beat them. We have to

, give 100 percent.”

On Wednesday, the Panthers
traveled to Edinboro, coming away
with a 3-0 win. The defense was
strong for the Panthers, allowing on-
ly five shots.

’’I thought the defense did a good
job,” Luxbacher commented.

_ ”Players like Todd Smith, Dan

Liberati, Chuma Emejulu and Seckin
Ablak were tough throughout the
game. What we need, though, is
stronger play in the midfield and up

Men finish third   
I at Big East tourney

By Beth Froelich
Staff. Writer

For the second year in a row, the
Pitt Panther men's tennis team has

finished strongly in the tough ‘Big East '
‘ -Tennis Championships. Last year the

team tied for second place with St.
John's. _
This year everyone was looking for
the Pitt team to be in contention
again for a top place finish. The Pitt
men's tennis team delivered to its
competition topnotch tennis and
secured a third-place tie with the
University of Connecticut. '
Boston College repeated last year's

first-place position, winning with a _

total of 46 points. St. John's Univer-
sity finished second with 34 points.
Tied in third place, with a total of 18
points, were Pitt and Connecticut.
Fourth place belonged to Villanova,
with 16 points. Georgetown finished
fifth with 12 points, and Providence
finished with 11 for sixth place. In last
place was Seton Hall, which won no
matches and finished with 0 points.

An unfortunate twist of events over-
shadowed the Pitt tennis team's play
during the tourney. The team, which
left Thursday at 5 _p.m., did not arrive

front. Dave Moss had a good game
in the midfield, but we need a full
team effort there. We can't rely on
the defense to shut out everybody.”

Although the Panthers did record
their fourth shutout of the season, the -
game was not a pretty one. ,

”It was the worst game we played
all year,” said senior tri-captain Todd
Smith. ”We were lucky to walk away
with a ,3-0 win and no injuries. What
we need to do is play tougher against
a weak team like Edinboro. We
started playing their game, and we
can't do that. We need to be more
aggressive. Each player needs to play
up to their capabilities, but not try to '
overstep them. ’

"I think against Ohio State we will
be more psyched up and will play a
much better game. We have to get
goal hungry. Our finishing could
make the difference between Pitt‘be-
ing a good team or an exceptional

at their Rhode Island destination un-

til Friday at 3 a.m. This was due, for
the most part, to a six-hour plane

delay in Newark. The team, which

was scheduled to play laterthat day,

felt justifiably fatigued.

”Our late arrival was enough to
take the competitive edge off our
players in the first day of play. I think
it ‘threw everyone’s internal rhythm
off,” commented Coach George
Dieffenbach.

The first day of play was at best
disappointing for the team. On Fri-
day, after play had concluded, the Pitt
team was in next-to-last place, hav-
ing advanced only two players to the
semi-final. round. As senior team

,member "Rich Monteleone com-

mented, ”The tournament didn't ex-
actly get off on the right foot.”
The determined Pitt tennis team
more than made up for Friday's
deficit by a tremendous 14-point
comeback during the following two
days. Going into the finalday of play,
Boston College had clinched first
place and St. John's had secured sec-
ond place. Villanova and Connecti-
cut were tied for third place with 15
points each. The Pitt men's team
knew the task that lay ahead of them.

Gary Richard is a ”cover” man. He
has played man-to-man defense all
his life, and his ability to cover
_receivers is why he was so hotly pur-
sued by schools around the nation.
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried said,
”He may be the best cornerback I
have ever coached.”

So who is Richard's role model?
There are a number of choices. How
about Mel Blount or Lester Hayes or
even Mike Haynes. No one covers

game against Mountaineers

Congemi’s first taste of the action
came in 1983 at Morgantown. He
was starting only the third game of
his career and did an admirable job,
completing 15 of 27 passes for 148
yards and one touchdown. He recalls
the touchdown, a 35-yard strike to
Bill Wallace, as one of his most
memorable moments of the series.
But WVU quarterback Jeff Hostet|er’s
six-yard run late in the fourth quarter
gave the Mountaineers 'a 24-21
victory.

In 1984, the Panthers fell to West
Virginia 28-10. Congemi had another
good day, completing eight of 16
passes for 83 yards before leaving the
game injured.

Last year's game was disappointing
in that Pitt moved the ball all over the
field at West Virginia but only had ,a
10-10 tie to show for i_t. The Panthers
outgained their opponents by almost
200 yards but were stymied by cost-
ly turnovers and penalties. Congemi

I had one of his finest passing outings

with a brilliant performance, hitting
18of 27 passes for 209 yards.

nothing but the utmost confidence in
his quarterback. ‘'1 really admire John

When I send him out on the field, I

Last week against Purdue, Pitt
made several costly mistakes which
the Boilermakers capitalized on to
take an early 14-0 lead. But Congemi
rallied his teammates and led them
to score 41 unanswered points for a
41-26 victory. ’

’’I had a gut check,” said Congemi.
”| just‘ wanted to wipe away the first
five minutes and say, ‘Hey, lfm bet-
ter than this.’ I told the team, "Let's
go out and play loose,‘ and that's
what happened. That's when we
started scoring.”

Gottfried praised his quarterback
for his leadership_on the field against
Purdue. ”l was pleased with John
Congemi’s performance,” Gottfried
said to a room full of reporters after
the game. ”His leadership again
helped us in critical situations.”

Teammate Charles Gladman also
complimented Congemi’s play.
”Congemi came through as always,”
said Gladman, sitting on a stool in the
locker room savoring Pitt's first win
of the year.

Introducing BASICALC1" The new
Texas Instruments programmable calculator.

Now there’s a programmable scientiﬁc calculator
that solves even the most complex math, engi-
neering and science problems in a BASIC way. .

The TI-74 BASICAI.C.

Unlike most other programmable calculators
that require you to learn a new, complicated
system of keystroke commands—in effect, a new

programming language — the TI—74 BASICALC

allows you to use the BASIC language program-

ming you already know.

' But don't let the BASICALC’sl ease of opera-
tion fool you. It also has more calculating power , ,
than comparably-priced programmables. And a A I

v variety of options, like software cartridges, are
available that make it even more powerful and

and statistics

° Optional PASCAL language cartridge
° Optional printer and cassette interface

THE P|Tl' News, Friday, September 26, 1986 I

 Students should su

I am enthusiastic and honored be-
ing the head football coach of the Pitt
Panthers. To be associated with the
great football tradition of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is a thrill to me, and
to be responsible for strengthening
that tradition is a privilege.

I am aware of the fact that wishing
and hoping will not restore Pitt to its
familiar spot among the college foot-
ball elite, but we both know that hard
work will.

We have had some disappoint-
ments to date, but there have been
good signs, too, and we believe we
are building something good and
worthwhile.

With you on our side, great things
can be accomplished.

This is what you are going to get

”l was pleased with the way Scott
played,” said Luxbacher. ”We need
that type of play for 90-minutes out
of all of our players. He is going to
make a difference for us."

While Reimer might not be ready
to go full force for a week or two, he
did enjoy getting the opportunity to
get back into the action.

’’I was really happy to play,” said
Reimer. ’’It was fun to get back into
the game. Edinboro was not that

I promise to you. I also guarantee to
you that my staff and I have based our
obligation to the Pitt football program
on the following foundation blocks
which will be our guidelines as we
work as a team:

LOYALTY — pervasive quality of
solidarity and commitment.

INITIATIVE — always looking for 9

things to do.

PRODUCTIVITY ——,time well in-
vested, not just spent.

PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE_—— in

work to do, though. lt.is a slow pro-
cess. I've lost a step or two, so I have
to start working on my own to get
back into shape.”

For now, the Panthers are happy to
put the win behind them and start
concentrating on what the next few
days have in store for them. It won't
be easy, but Pitt will find out fast if
_it has what it takes to go up against
a top team like Ohio State. Like Lux-
bacher said, they will rise to the oc-
casion.

LOVE — the emotional beauty of
being collectively involved in an ex-
citing experience and a sense of
urgency; the time for getting things
done is now.

We prepare for every game with a
sense of urgency. We want to win
each game because we know what
it means to everybody who cares
about Pitt, its athletic programs and
its school pride.»

This same sense of urgency is what
I am asking you to adopt as your in-
vestment in the progress of the Pitt
athletic program. ' I

We appreciate what you have
done in the past.

not take.a back seat to any school

none of these schools were NCAA

about that. Some more recent names

himself a leader in the secondary just

leaders too.”

Johnson lost in the finals. ,

Dadowski presented the best per-

and blocked a remarkable six punts.
For Pittthis season, Richard has 11
tackles (eight unassisted) and two in-
terceptions. The season is long from
over, however.

”One thing-l think you are going
to notice from Gary Richard,” Gott-
fried said, ”is that he is going to con-
tinue to get better as _the season
progresses. By the end of the season,
he may be one of the better corner-
backs in the East.”

in doubles action, Meyerowich and
Maben won the final round of the

The change is an attempt to in-

crease public awareness ot the
unique opportunities the center
has to after.

”This complex has been serv-
ing public interest in art, science,

music and literature since l 895,

yet much of the community still
does not know the extent at
what we have to otter," notes
President Robert C. Wilburn.
The name change gives a
stronger identity to the complex
and eliminates much at the tar-
mality.

Other changes have accom—l

panied the name change. ln an
ettort to make the complex more
inviting to the public, outdoor
chairs were added to the Scaite
Plaza, the Sculpture Court and
the sycamore grove along
Schenley Plaza. Also, long
range plans include the renova—
tion ol maior exhibit halls and the

7 addition at air conditioning. The

Carnegie also provides tree
t:'a.nsportation to the museums
and library via a l9aO's Britisf
doubl.edecl<er bus duringthe
month at September.

Another new addition is the it.-
auguration ot a new program
entitled The School
Carnegie. The new school otters
classes to ‘both children and
adults. The classes range trom

and painting tostudying the

The SHOWCASE Interview

keeps a secret; it employs
A.T.S., a rock band from Pitts-
burgh. Living in the half-world to
which modern rock artists in this
city are condemned, A.T.S.
plays for fun at the Electric
Banana, Graffiti and the
Decade, hauling to make
money. Yet curiously, in their
microcosm of rock experience,
all the energy and political in-
volvement to which rock artists
seem doomed by conscience to

articipate in are there, in the
ifestyle and mental develop-
ment of Mike, Josh, Steve and
Evan.

The interview took place in the
dressing room at Graffiti on
Saturday, Sept. i3, during a
concert at which Hector in Paris
warmed upfor A.T.S. Although
the atmosphere was exciting,
the band seemed relaxed and
warmed easily to the interview.

Wanting to ask casual ques-
tions first, I began by askin
what led them to take up roci
music.

"Music heightens your

Steve answered for Mike,

"Of the clubs in Pittsburgh,

"And with the audience?
There does tend to be a trash

Yes, i thought, but politics is
about progress, and progress
means change, so l wondered
how their political orientation
was affected by a traditionally

"There are things about all
that which give me the creeps,"
said Steve. "Like hearing that
the food shipments end up in the

it's great that Bob Geldof did it,

Evan is a relative of Patrick

l have to admit, when The Pitt
News first gave me a review
copy of this book, I felt a wave
of cynicism wash over me. Here,
in the bicentennial year of Pitt, l
have a book of its history,
published by the University
Press, no less. What was l go-
ing to say — no, ~| didn't like it?

Four or five days passed and
the book sat on my desk. I eyed
it like it was calc homework.
Deadline approached, how-
ever, and l was forced to pick it
up and give it the quick once-
over before I scribbled a-few
nice words about it.

  LEIST

‘~/‘-/ell 

This ”once-over" turned into
an entire night, while Robert C.
Alberts led me on a fascinating
iourney through time — Pitt time,
that is. This is no dry history book
crammed with facts and figures.
This is a truly enioyable, in-
teresting, educational tale of the
cast of characters building Pitt
over the past 200 years.

Alberts himself says in the
book's preface, There was
drama; there was fradegy; there
were indeed controversies and
po//tics. There were, unex-
pected/y, r/"ch veins of humor,
and occasiona//y, of comedy.
And that's exactly what l read.
This chronological account of
achievements — and setbacks -
of the university's chancellors
over a span of 200 years is full
of, in Alberts own words, "rich
veins.” ln .fact, one might be
tempted to say this book reads
like the outlines for some very
slick fiction, full of emotion and
description, certainly enough to
catch one's attention — definite-
ly enough to engage the imagi-
nation_.

As a native Pittsburgher, l was
fascinated by the descriptions of
the city as the Western Univer-
sity-of Pennsylvania was built

around it. From T787, when-

Hugh Henry Brackenridge
arrived from Philadelphia to
begin the Pittsburgh Academy,
to the completion of Forbes

Quadrangle in l979, lfound

 

tt’s bicentennial,

myself imagining Pittsburgh as it '_'

had been and comparing it to
the locations as they are today.
Homes Department Store, the
North Side, Schenley Park,
William Pitt Union — places l
have seen so often they’ve
become mundanel— now
challenge me to imagine what
they looked’ like in the past.
Locations aren't the only
things l see with a fresh perspec-
tive. Alberts gives me names —
names l had formerly assigned
to buildings, a bank, a museum
— names that had previously
meant little more to me than par-
ticular families with a lot of cash.
Alberts' skill, though, presents
the individual people, their per-
sonalities, their willingness —
and unwillingness — to help
establish a leading educational

facility in Pittsburgh. The names ,

Schenley, l\/lellon, Rockefeller
and Scaife, to list a few, now
bring much more to mind than a
dollar sign.

To alumni, students and Pitts-,

burghers alike, this book offers
the chance to see the university
in a very special light. Wherever
you are right now, look up and
study your surroundings. If you
see buses roaring down Fifth
Avenue, imagine a horse—drawn
wagon. lf you're catching the
last of the summer sun on

Paul Simon

.Vliorner Brothers
 By Douglas Payne

Since the debut of his first solo I

album in l97l, Paul Simon has
not only studied but pursued on-
avid. interest in African music and

L. A its rhythms. While Peter Gabriel

was doing ”art rock" with
Genesis and the Talkin Heads
were still in art schoo, Simon
began experimenting with
African elements in his music —
which had up until then received

his mostpopular examples, yet
he soon sacrificed his African
spirit for the call of the ’70s pop
formula. Now, following the
release of l983’s ultra—yuppie
snoozer, Hearts and Bones,
which glorified middle age and
Carrie Fisher, Simon has re-
turned to challengin himself ar-
tistically. Where di he have to

before. Even if you're familiar
with the many native African
musicians who perform on the
album, the music is delightfully _
provocative.‘ Simon is iustifiably
proud of this effort, as his liner
notes indicate, and of those
people who contributed to it. But
the pride goes to‘ his heart, not
his head. The song ”Grace-
land" enshrines the former
”King’s” estate as an icon of
Americana by claiming, I have
reason to be/ieve, we a// will be

destination? These are the con-
cerns not of the heart but, of
course, of the American dream.
lronically, the crisp and lively
rhythm of the tune is not African
by structure but by design -
much like ”Late in the Evening"
was to some extent. So, we

° discover, Paul Simon has left

home to find home. Although
recorded in Africa, ”Grace-
land” speaks of America in
American terms (with; the
buoyancy of a Nile. Rogers
sound) to Americans.

”Graceland” updates Simon
and Garfunkel-’s ”America
much in the same way ”The Boy
in the Bubble” refocuses the

\
s

aims of ”The Sounds of Silence” ‘

to address the '80s. ”The Boy

in the Bubble” is the work of a‘

social poet and a musical con-
noisseur. Simon wonders about
the way we look to us all and
further queriesfthe way we look
to a distant conste//ation/dying in
the corner of the sky. This star-
tling ideal is delivered over a
mesmerizing blend of accor-
dians, synthesizers and percus-
sion to create a hypnotic
evaluation on the current state of
the world. Simon addresses rele-
vant social issues without dating

« himself in such a way that says,

”Hey world, take a look at
yourselves." Grace/and begins
by addressing the human race
then specifically Americans, and
weaves in stories of individuals
with discoveries of his own to
create not only an amazing
musical statement, but a social-
ly relevant one at that. The
American and African distinc-
tions need no more lip service
from this point on.

”Under African Skies," a
beautiful duet with Linda
Ronstadt, is a tender moment
with biblical implications that
hints at what the Grace/and pro-
iect is all about. ”Diamonds on
the Sales of Her Shoes," with its
beautiful a cappella introduc-
tion, is ‘a nice example of how
well Simon intertwines his poetry
with exceedingly” involving
music. ”You Can Call Me Al”

always fascinating. Grace/and

ture from what we have come to
expect of McCartney these
days.

Corning as it does after the
serious Tug of War and the
tense Pipes of Peace, Press To
P/ay is McCartney at his ”have
a good time” best. You will find
no songs on this album dealing
with death, war or racial
problems.

What you will find is the
rollicking ”Press," the album's
first single. This a beat—heavy
dance song of little lyrical quali-
ty. The verses have an easy flow
to them, but the chorus seems
forced and is a letdown, par-
ticularly after the first verse.

The two best songs on the
album are the slower "Foot-
prints” and "Only Love Re-
mains."

”Footprints" is a touching
ballad about the loneliness that
sometimes never goes away. lt
contains McCartney's most
moving lyrics since Tug of War’s
”Here Today": White blanket,
hiding the traces of tears she
didn't see./Oh white blanket

covers the memory/Of a// that

used to be,/Of a// that used to.

be./ But his heart keeps aching
in the same old way./He can ’t
he/p fee/ing that she might come
back someday.

Following ”Footprints" and
closing the first side of the album
is ”Only Love Remains," a
classic McCartney ballad as on-
ly he can write them. This song
is in the ’’Let It Be"/”l\/ly Love”

i tradition. It has a predictible,
' McCartney- ballad melody, but

as. the master himself asked
about silly love songs, What's
wrong with that?

The other highlight of the
album is the ambitious ”Talk
More Talk” which sounds more
like it is an outtake of a John Len-
non/Yoko Ono recording session
from the early l970s. This song
will come as a bit of a shock to
latter—day McCartney fans, but
those who remember Paul as the
mind behind both Sgt. Pepper
and /\/lagica/ Mystery Tour
know he is capable of the
avant—garde.

He succeeded in ”Press,” but
with the exceptions of ”Foot-

ROCK THERAPY
The Stray cats
EMI America

By Big Daddy
Mccoolboots

How many bands do you
know of that relish being refer-
red to as- ”retro?" The Stray
Cats wear that tag as proudly as
they display their tatooed

forearms. Unfortunately, in the
case of the "stuck in the ’50s”
Cat's, a Duane Eddy twang, a
spinning upright bass and the
steady thump of the snare have
never invited comparisons to
Gene, Vincent or Eddie
Cocharan.

‘Recorded and mixed in less
than a week, Rock Therapy finds
Brian Setzer and the boys within
the familiar confines of Rockabil-
ly City. This time out, though, the
band has released a mixture of
their own compositions with
some old favorites by artists like
Chuck Berry (”Beautiful Deli-
lah’-’), Gene Vincent ("Race
with the Devil") and Buddy Hol-
ly (”Lookin’ for Someone to
Love”). Having atched up the
riftthat followed)Setzer's deci-
sion to record his debut solo
album, the band approached
this project in order to renew

themselves through a little rock
therapy. As usual, the "hit-and-
miss" Cats have given us the in-
spired alongside the insipid; it's
a vinyl minefield, if you will.

None of the five '50s covers
add anything to the originals.
Why bother to listen to these
punks if you can hear Chuck
play the real thing? Know what
I mean? Things only heat up
when Setzer, who again
amazes me with his fluid guitar
lines, contributes his own solo
compositions. ”Reckless” would
not have sounded out of place
on his The Knife Feels like Justice
record. It only lacks the whomp-

THE —PlTT NEWS, Friday, September 26, 1986

, ing backbeat of Kenny Aronoff,
the drummer in John Cougar
Melloncamp’s band, who pro-
vided the power on Knife that is
absent in The Stray Cats’ entire
catalogue.

Thankfully, Setzer breaks the
string of monotonous rim shots
with the album's two closing
numbers. ”Broken Man” floats
along on a cloud of rich har-
mony, and ”Change of Heart”
offers the fuller, more dense
sounds of Setzer’s solo band.
Listening to these songs makes
me hunger for his next Cat-free
outing. Setzer is a powerful
vocalist and instrumentalist who

is needed more by Slim Jim
Phantom and Lee Rocker than he
needs them. Rock Therapy is
most appealing when the two
less aggresive Cats slide to the
background. In other words,
Setzer's contribution is the only
thing therapeutic about this
record.

Winwood extols the high life

STEVE WINWOOD
The Syria Mosque
Sept. I9, I986

By John Mccombe

It began and ended with a
slice of the past. Blue light.
flooded the solitary figure at
the piano. /t is only the sound
of the /ow spark of high heel-
ed boys, sang the former
Traffic director on a jazzed
up version of his l5- year old
composition. Two hours later,
the one time ”Litt|e Stevie”
belted out The Spencer Davis
Group's ”Gimme Some
Lovin’.” After 2l years, this
rock ’em, sock ’em, white

_ R&B supreme still had people

pounding their hands numb
on the two and four of the
backbeat. I swear that I saw
steam rise from the keys of
Winwood’s Hammond
organ.

Still, this was no oldies
show. The star of the evening
was the new Steve Win-
wood album. The eight songs
from Back in the High life
dominated the song selec-
tion. Actually, other than an
extended romp through ”l’m A

' a Man,” which featured an

ear- twisting conga break,
Winwood concentrated
primarily on material from his
three solo albums of the '80s.

The familiar synthesizer in-
tro to ”While You See a
Chance” transfixed a diverse
crowd with its delicate beau-
ty. Then, as Winwood ex-
ploded vocally on the song's
chorus, his band registered
the evening's only disap-
pointment. The tempo nearly
raced out of control. Speed
does not always yield inten-
sity as Steve himself proved
on ”lvly Love's Leavin’.” It
was a strangely mournful yet
movin sidelight to an even-
ing fullgof the celebration of

the high me.

The evening's -climax oc-
curred when the audience
chimed in with harmonies on
”Higher Love.” The crowd
failed to scale the heights of
Chaka Khan's back up vocal
on the album track but they
did know the words and had
a lot of fun as they warbled
along.

On two occaisions, Steve
Winwood exclaimed, ”lt’s

‘great to be back.” Usually,

a phrase like this may be dis-
missed as a performer's
cliche along the lines of
”Hello, Pittsburgh! Are you
ready to rock ’n’ roll?" In this
case, I think he meant it. And
he wasn't referring to being
back in this particular city. He
outlined his love affair with
the stage over the gentle
mandolin accompanimentin
"Back in the High Life." With
their ecstatic reaction, the
standing room only Syria
Mosque crowd strongly
returned that sentiment.

The evening's first perform-
ance was a 45-minute solo
acoustic set by a guy from
Buffalo named Peter Case,
the former leader of an.L.A.
power op band called The
Plimsou s. His equal parts
delivery of Dylan/T—Bone
Burnett folk intensity deserv-
ed more audience attention
than it received. He accom-
panied selections from his
Geffen debut with blasts from
his harmonica and a voice
that could cut through con-
crete. His material was, at
times, hilarious, vaguely
spiritual and completely cap-
tivating. Peter Case is a name
to remember. His perfor-
mance will be hard to forget.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September 26,1986

By Douglas Payne

BREAKTHROUGH
Don Pulien/George
Adams Quartet
Blue Note

This duo of Charles Mingus
alumnae have finally released
their first American album after
sevenyears of highly acclaimed
records for the French Soul Note
label. This is exciting and irresisti-
ble stuff. Playing what might be
caileda hybrid of avant—garde
blues and hard bop, Adams and
Pullen do some intense iazz

that's surprisingly accessible. ’

Don Pullen's driving and melodic
piano style paired with George
Adams’ fiery tenor are perfect
complements atop the fine work
of the bassist and drummer.
These people.understand each
other very well, and the col-
laboration is precise and
definitive. The material (espe-
cially ”Mr. Smoothis’-’ and
”Song From The Old Country”)
is excellent and is a reflection of
the talent involved. These guys
could become heroes in a cou-
ple of years.

INSIDE TRACK
Out of the Blue
Blue Note

Admittedly, Inside Track took
about three spins before I real-
ized how delicate and superb it
is. Out of the Blue is an im-
pressive collection of young
musicians who auditioned for a
place in the group when Blue
Note re—formed last year.
Highlighted by the terrific play-
ing of Kenny Garrett and pianist
Harry Pickens, this group works
well together on their second
outing for the label. All composi-
tions are original and abide by
the classic formulas of straight-

    

of jazz

r ha «I

ahead iazz without conde-
scending to style copying. ”Hot
House,” ”lnside Track” and
”Nathan Jones” are impressive
tunes that display the dexterity
of talent involved. Perhaps the
reason Inside Track didn't settle
with me until the fourth time is
that it seems so unusual to have
young unknowns (who won't
last for long) playing such
thoughtful iazz with such love in
i986. Classy stuff.

PIANISM
Michel Petrucciani Trio
Blue Note

This guy is probably the finest
and most impressive pianist
practicing ”pianism" on the
scene today. He beautifully
emulates his idol, Bill Evans, yet
he delivers in a colorful progres-
sion all his own. Pianism, his

THE Pntwews, Friday, September 26, 1986

toinette are schoolteachers by
trade, but while Gina stayed
right here in town, Antoinette left
for the greener pastures of St.
Louis, where she spent l2 years
before returning home to Pitts-
burgh. The two brothers also left
town, Dino serving an appren-
ticeship with the Hyatt Hotel
chain, Marco leaving for New
York.City where he worked in
the computer graphics field.
But suddenly the homing in—
stinct got the better of these
wandering siblings who ended
up back in town with the idea of
starting a family business. After
toying with the idea of opening
up an enterprise in the computer
graphics or teaching related
fields, the quartet decided to try
their hand with a restaurant. And
why not? After all, Gina's hus-
band Mark had l4 years of ex-
perience in the restaurant
business both here and in Min-

nesota. And their parents had

been reat lovers of food.
Mama Trad been a good cook
and Papa a successful
businessman. Both parents en-

‘ couraged their children to-open

up a restaurant and even lent
them some of the money to get
started.

The concept guiding their
culinary style is to prepare light,

-cooked-to-order food, served in

a quick fashion from skillet or grill
to the table. Emphasis is on
freshness, and the proprietors in—
sist that the vegetables, herbs

and other ingredients that go in— ~

to making the dishes typical of
the coastal areas of Italy and
Southern France be at their best.

Everything at Cafe Allegro is
seved a la carte, which means
that you can eat as little or as
much as you desire and pay ac-
cordingly. One factor that helps
keep the cost of the meal down
is the lack of a liquor license. The
management permits their diners
to bring their own wine. Alas,
this situation may changein the
near future as a liquor license
may be forthcoming at any mo-
ment so it's best to ask if wine or
liquor is available when calling
for reservations.

Cafe Allegro begins each
meal by serving a complimen-
tary hors d’oeuvre of some sort
or other. We started ours off
with a ramekin of creamy liver
pate that we prom tly spread
over slices of French read. After
whetting our appetites on this
delight we honed in on two
dishes off the menu, steamed
mussels ($4.95) and shrimp in
garlic and marsala ($5.95)._The
mussels were large, plump
morsels that ringed a plate
which contained a center bowl
of freshly made marinara sauce,
moderately flavored with garlic,
great for dunking our hot
seafood delicacies into. The
shrimp, however proved to be
the more enjoyable of the two
appetizers as each piece was
large, succulent and tantalizing-
ly delicious in a cream, garlic
and Marsala wine sauce,
dusted with fresh chopped

. parsley.

We next, wisely tried a salad,
of homegrown tomatoes topped
topped by slices of mozzerella
cheese ($2.95), served at room
temperature (the cheese was
tastier and,tenderer that way)
with a wonderful salad dressing

made up of nothing more than L

virgin olive oil and finely chgp
ul

ped basil. What a deligh

change from the usual iceberg
lettuce salad with the mandatory
additions of one tomato wedge,
an olive and perhaps a pep-
peroncini.

Moving on, we passed up the
house specials, opting. instead
for two of the regular menu en-
trees. I picked the grilled veal
steak ($lO.95), and l certainly
have to pat myself on the back
for my excellent choice. The veal
was fork tender, swimming in a
sauce of Marsala wine and its
own juices; embellished with im-
ported shitaki mushrooms,
julienned red peppers and black
peppercorns, a dish l can com-
fortably recommend to anyone
who enjoys the finer things in life.
lfbrdered a side dish of pasta
Minestra ($3.35), another win-
ner composed of noodles mixed
with crunchy snowpeas,
mushrooms, diced celery, car-
rots and Swiss chord, with a
garlic marinara sauce. Our other
entree‘ was a salmon steak
($8.95), topped with sea
scallops and baked in parch-
ment paper to steam the fish in
a mixture of white wine, tomato,
green onion, julienned vegeta-
bles"and spices- The parchment
paper allows the salmon to stay
moist and tender while, at the
same time, locking in theflavors
of the fish a_nd vegetables. We
tried a half order of fettucini
Alfredo ($2.95), wide pasta

 

"credit cards:

noodles doused in a white
cream sauce that proved to be
less exciting than the pasta
Minestra.

Saving room for dessert, we
tried a rectangular slice of farinal
chopped English walnut cake
that had been frosted with fresh
whipped cream. The gateau
was surprisingly devoid of sugar

and only mildly sweet, much to ‘

my satisfaction. For those with a
sweet tooth, try the lemon and
galliano flavored chiffon
cheesecake, ‘ lighter in texture
than most, topped with a
strawberry sauce over one side
of the slice and a blueberry
sauce draped over the other.
Both desserts were $2.50.
Don't be surprised if some of
these dishes are no longer
served by the time you get to the
restaurant. We picked our meal
from what was labelled the sum-
mer menu. Cafe Allegro has an
”ever changing menu” in keep-
ing with its policy to serve fresh
foods at the peak of season.

Pitt secondary

no longer smells
of burnt toast

By Jim Urban
Editor-in-Chief

Last year, they were ”The Burnt _

Toast Patrol.” Fortunately for Mike
Gottfried, their nickname is no longer
applicable.

They are the members of the Pitt
defense, and Gottfried is the man
who inherited them when he took
over the head coaching position at
Pitt.

Pitt had annually been ranked as
one of the top 10 rushing defenses
in the nation. Stopping the run was
easy. The problem came on third
down when the opponent decided to
pass. Five different teams threw for
over 200 yards against the Panthers
last season.

Gottfried and his staff installed an
entirely new defensive scheme,
switching to the 4-3‘ from the 5-2
former coach Foge Fazio used.

He also made some personnel
changes. Junior Teryl Austin, who
finished fifth in_ the nation with seven
interceptions last year,’ moved from
cornerback to free safety. Former run-
ning back Billy Owens, also a junior,
settled alongside him at strong safe-
ty, and another former running back,
junior Zeke Gadson, took over at
weakside linebacker. ,

The only thing this group lacked
now was a stopper at cornerback.
Enter Gary Richard, a junior college
transfer from Denver, Colo. Said
Gottfried, ”He may be the best defen-
sive back that I have ever coached.”

After three games, Pitt's defense is
ranked third in the nation against the
rush, allowing 37 yards per game.
The Panthers are ranked_ 13th na-

_ tionally in overall defense, allowing

240 yards per game. The group
seems to be jelling. .

”We are like a family," Richard
proclaimed, and it is Richard» who is
quickly developing into its big
brother. Last week, Richard picked
off two passes against the pass-
oriented Purdue Boilermakers as Pitt
evened its season record at 1-1-1 with
at 41-26 victory.

Richard's partner in crime at the
other corner, junior Quintin Jones,
also had a theft, giving him three in-

  WHEN THE
MOUNTAINEERS
HAVE THE BALL

terceptions for the season (tied for
fifth in the nation), and senior strong
safety Billy Owens added two more,
one of which he returned for a
touchdown. It seemed! the only
”burnt toast” Pitt experienced at
West Lafayette, lnd., was during the
pre-game meal —— at breakfast.

‘ ”This is a more aggressive-type
defense than last year,” senior defen-
sive end Tony Woods said Wednes-
day. ’’It is defintely making us better

_ players.”

The Pitt-West Virginia matchup
will test the Pitt defense one more
time. Two words pop into Woods’
mind when asked about the annual
Backyard Brawl. ”Very physical," he
said.

"Their offensive linemen are
always big and strong, 6-4 or 6-5 and
in the 260-lb. range. They have the
big guys up front that can block.”

And it keys a strong running game
led by Undralohnson, a sophomore
from Ft. Lauderdale; Fla. Johnson is
the Mountaineers’ leading rusher
with 234 yards on 44 carries. Support
comes from senior John Holifield
(143 yards on 30 carries) and junior
Pat Randolph (120 yards on five
carries).

”They have great balance on of-
fense,” Gottfried said. ”They may be
the best offensive team we will have

.played. They throw the ball really
well.”

Sophomore quarterback Mike
Timko, a 6-2, 191-pounder from
Euclid, Ohio, leads the Mountaineer
passing game. He has completed 51
percent of his passes (46 for 91) and
has thrown three touchdowns with
only two interceptions.

His favorite target is senior Harvey
Smith (11 receptions for 137 yards).
Sophomore Keith Winn (seven for
69), junior John Talley (six for 78),
sophomore Calvin Phillips (six for 76)
and sophomore Grantis Bell (five for
94)" add support.
