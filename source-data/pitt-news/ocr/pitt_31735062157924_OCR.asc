But he had been an office boy only

was made manager of copy research:

left Yale, he was vice—president in

On Harper’s team is his wife Vir-

  dPro(Iuiction "Dark  the  
Climaxes Week of Spring Festivities

The stage of Stephen Foster Me-
morial will be taken over on May
12, 13, and 14, by the mountain
people of the Great Smokies of

North Carolina when the Pitt _

Players present “Dark of the

Moon.”
“Dark of the Moon” is the story

.of John, a witch boy, who, with

the aid of a conjur woman, is made
into a human being so that he

,might marry Barbara Allen, one
of the fairest girls in the Smoky
Mountains.

The witch boy is granted his
wish, butthere is a stipulation that
the girl must remain true to him
for one year or he’ll revert to his
former self. The townspeople are
suspicious of John, and when Bar-

bara gives birth to a misshapen‘

child, they are more than ever

convinced that John is a witch.
Barbara stays true to her hus-

band almost the entire year, but

-she is attacked by a former suitor

at a revival meeting. She dies, and
the witch boy, never entirely hap-
py as a human, returns‘ to his for-
mer haunts in the Smoky Moun-
tains. ‘

. Mel Silver will be seen as John,
the witch boy, who falls in love
with Barbara... Barbara will be
played by Gloria Brodie. Cecelia
Boodman plays the Jonjur Woman
who transforms the witch boy into
a— human. 2

Marvin Hudgens,‘ played by Art
Ragen, is the farmer who causes
Barbara to break her ‘vow. Bob
Dickey plays‘ Preacher Haggler,
the down-to-earth preacher who
marries John and Barbara in the
general store.

Beti Bucci and Doris Kolasheski
will be seen as the witches who
lure John back to the mountains. _

Tickets for “Dark of the Moon”

may be obtained at the student

desk or from members of Players.

Under the auspices of Y. W.
Anne Pennoyer and Dodie Seale
go up Shady.Avenue to, the Crip-
pled Children’s Home every Fri-
day afternoon. There they teach
ﬁnger—painting — and thus coord-

sey. Anne, calling the work “fas-
cinating” and “wonderful,” says
that they can see the progress al-

full rehabilitation credit, for the

understanding nurses and‘ work-

Some of the other girls lneqoed

With a view to stock-pﬂing basic
knowledge, the Du Pont Company
has announced a program of grants-
in-aid for ‘the collegeyear 1949-50 to
10 universities for unrestricted
use in the ﬁeld of fundamental re-

A search in chemistry.

The grants-in-aid of $10,000»ea‘Eh
are to be used for research thathas
no immediate commercial goal. The
universities themselves, are to select
the ‘projects in which the grants will
be employed, and results of the re-
search are to be ‘freely available for
publication.

HOW FUNDS WILL BE USED
Du Pont’s lpurposein offering the
grants is to help insure the flow of

‘fundamental -knowledge in science
upon which the future industrial de-
velopment of our country is so de-
pendent. It is intended that thefunds
be utilized for s_uch—expenses as em-

- ploying additional research personnel

or lightening the teaching load of a

professor who is eminently capable .

of research of a high order. They

may also be expended for the pur- 

pose of obtaining supplies, appara-
tus or equipment. ‘ -

GRANTS ARE EXPERIMENTAL,
_ This program of grants-in-aid is
largely experimental. However, it ‘is
Du Pont’s hope, should the program
work out "satisfactorily, to continue
each grant for a period of ﬁve years.

Bobby Lewis, left ﬁelder, had to

Although ‘he limped from the

Salem. It is doubtful if \Mc,Gill
will be able to make the trip.

_ No Deﬁnite Pitcher

Mitterling has named no deﬁn-
ite starting‘ hurler for today’s
game with the Tigers, but the
nod may go to reliable Deryl
Calder, despite a four-inning re-
lief trick against W&J.

Calder subdued Salem, _2-1, in
the only other ‘meeting with
Coach Carl Mallon’s West Vir-,
ginia Conference champions. Cald-

—-,er struck out 16 to beat the Tig-5

ers in 13 innings atthe Oval on
April 25. Jack Smodic’s homerun
clout with no one out in the last
inning decided the contest.

Salem Highly-Touted

Aside from the? defeat at the
hands of the Panthers, Salem has
been able to pound out wins over
all other opponents and are tout-
ed to- take state honors again this
year. The team is -virtually the
same as last year’s.

The road will get rougher ‘for
Pitt when the Mittmen tangle with
the Penn State Lions on Friday
and Saturday of this week.

Frank Papariel1o’s initial ap-
pearance as a starting hurler

against W&J was not as impress-
ive as expected. After giving up
four runs in ﬁve innings, he was
followed to the mound by Larry
Brent and Deryl Calder.

Pitt’s six-run eighth. inning
iced the game.

Baseball Drills

Freshmen baseball practice’ be_-
gan yesterday at Schenley Oval
Field and will continue for a
period of three weeks under the
coaching of Mike Joseph of the
physical education department.

About 25 applications have been
accepted since last Wednesday,
and it is hoped that more men
will turn out for the practice
sessions. Frank Carver, graduate
manager, said thetfrosh will work
out with Ralph Mitterling’s var:
sity._ ' I ,

No freshmen games will be
scheduled, he said. All candidates
will be provided locker space at
the Stadium and will be trans-
ported from the Stadium to the
Oval by shuttle bus, '

The freshmen practice is nec-
essary so that Mitterling will have
ample opportunity to screen the
players for next year. ‘Weather
permitting, the freshmen will also
hold practice on days which the
varsity play games away.

“at 1:30 p. m.

the .400 mark.

But complications, usually in
theform of weak bats, have con-
tinually confronted Mitterling as
far as right is concerned. One
man after anotherhas gone to the
post and, until the second West
Virginia game, just as many re-
turned to the bench.

In order, Frank Papariello,
Johnny Finfrock, Sam Shapiro,
Joe Ross, Jim Couch,'Frank Sus-
ko and Bobby Lewis have all had
a hand in the ﬁy chasing depart-
ment ‘in right since the opener
with Waynesburg.

Of the seven, one has been turn-
ed into a pitcher, four have been
benched, one has temporarily
nailed a starting assignment, and

the last was beaned by a discus:

to be lost for the season.

Lewis has started the last three,

games for Mitterling and has col-
lected four hits for a .400 aver-
age. One’ of the safeties was a

single with the sacks loaded in
the ﬁrst inning of the second
West Virginia game.

Bobby is regarded by Mitterling
and many of ...,~..
the players as,
the best ﬁelder T
on the squad. If
he i keeps hit-
ting, the traf-
ﬁc congestion
running from
the player’s
bench to the
outer gardens
in." right may
ﬁnally come to _
a halt. Mitterlmg

Although Mitterling’s outﬁeld-
ers have never expressed antici-
pation or an expectancy to be
classed among the elite in base-
ball’s “Who’s Who,” they have
caused minor states of confusion

    

in the press box as to who’s been

who in right ﬁeld. ,

Punling. Passing Looks W

 

AI Close of Spring Praciice   

By WILL DOERGE .
If Saturday’s intra-squad game was any indication of Pitt’s fu-
ture prowes on the gridiron, then the need for correcting two de-

fects is a must.

‘The lack of an effective passing attack was apparent, as well
as the need for a long distance punter. »

The ﬁrst stringers exerted littleO—

Golfers I:IIII$lI‘.%

effort in walking off with the ex-
pected victory over the reserves,
despite the low score of 14-6.
Hardisty’s Toe Out

With Bill Hardisty seemingly
relegated to a reserve role, the
varsity is left without an adequate
punter. End Ted Geremsky, who
pulled out of the line to kick for
the Varsity Blues, didn’t fare too
well.

Hardisty continued his excellent
punting for the Whites, but his
toe may go for naught this fall

because __of' the new substitution‘,

rule.

Jimmy Joe Robinson was easi-
ly the best running back on the
ﬁeld, reeling off several long gains
for the Blues. .

Sumpter Looks Good

Defensive standout for the
Whites was End Earl Sumpter,
who consistently broke up the
Blue attack with his aggressive

—play. Sumpter gave. the '.Whites
their only score when he picked

out Jim Carnpbell’s fumble in
mid-air and sprinted 23 yards for
the touchdown. ‘ ,

Campbell, a freshman, got a big
chance when he broke into the
Blue’s starting array at the i-njury-
riddled fullback post..

The Panther gridders’ next
football activity will take place- at
their fall camp, in preparation
for the season opener with Wil-
liam and Mary.
