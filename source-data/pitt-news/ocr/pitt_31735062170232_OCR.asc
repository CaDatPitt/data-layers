In sitting down to write an arti-
cle about the Three Rivers Arts
Festival, I find myself confront-
ed with a confusing mixture of re-
actions about the whole event.
First, as a student of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, I realize that
many of the men who I feel wield
a highly illegitimate power as
members of our Board of Trus-
tees are also, to a great part, re-
sponsible for the Arts Festival of
the “Renaissance Cityi” Guild by
association, you might say? Not
if objectives are the same, i.e., a

nice clean respectable image com- A

piled with some very insidious
forms of control. Second, there is
the urge to consider the various
works in the show out of the con-
text in which the idea of the Fes-
tival was conceived, and see how
the various bits and pieces stack
up as good art. And third,«I feel
that someplace, hidden beneath
the rusty tractor seats and magic
shows that there’s some sort of

image that the ‘whole mess is try-
ing to live up to.

Anyway, after being confront-
ed by numerous well-scrubbed
and groomed faces that represent
the management of the Festival,
and setting aside my normal av-
ersion for overt cheerfulness on
the part of such people, I decided
that I should be charitable about
the whole thing. I’ve got nothing
to lose; this is an article, not a
review. '*

And as far as purposes go, the
Arts Festival is a moderate suc-
cess. There is a healthy airing of
a large number of local artists in
some 1,000 pieces of artwork.
Something for everybody.

Aside from the exhibits, there
were a great number of side
events such as the Duuuesne Brass
Esemble of the Eric Kloss Quar-
tet. I happened to lie down near

Phi|osophyProfLeads Dorm Opposition

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer
Violent opposition to the University’s pro-
posed plans to erect new dormitory-apartments

.in the area of Schenley Heights has erupted

from an organization of community members,
initiated in large part by Dr. William W. Bart-
ley, professor of philosophy.

Dr. Bartley charged that the administration
has been dealing in both illegal and unethical
tactics in its attempt to change the zoning
classification of the area from residential
first-class to institutional. The justification
for this move results from the University’s op-
tion to exercise eminent domain in the area ad-
jacent to its campus. 1

Several objections were raised by the. en-
flamed faculty member to the prospective ac-
tion:

—-Traffic congestion. The intersection of
Center Avenue and Alliquippa services three
schools, Falk, Frick and Schenley High School,
and functions as one of the main arteries lead-
ing from downtown Pittsburgh to outlying
areas.

—-Inconvenience. During periods of poor
weather conditions, the areasproposed for the

construction are difficult to reach without the
use of a car. The University has included no
plans for the development of parking facilities.

——Lack of services. Since the area has al-
ways been a residential community, there are
no conveniently located stores, etc.

—Community pride. The area under ques-
tion is.one of the only fully integrated (60 per
cent Black, 40 per cent White) locales in the
city. It isconsidered part of the Hill and as
such its maintenance has become a matter of
pride for the residents.

——Decrease of property value. The location
of a skyscraper so close to a first-class resi-
dential area endangers the financial value’ of
the homes within the community.

In response to the perceived threat, more
than 40 families have mobilized in a group to
oppose it. Known as the Center Heights Asso-
ciation for Preservation, the organization is
headed by the Rev. Alfred Pugh, Black minis-
ter of a church in the area.

Dr. Bartley seriously questions the motiva-
tion of the University in proposing the zoning

change. He asserts that “the University is at-’

tempting to‘ build a White -Wall to cut off the

Hill. If the University pruins economically a

community that’ has a great degree of Black
Power, what meaning can a Black studies pro-
gram have? It’s relevance is lost,” he said.

The question of relevance again arises, as . .

perceived by the philosophy. teacher when it is
revealed that the University has included no ur-
ban planning in its master plan for the area.

All efforts for negotiation were rejected by
the University administration, revealed Dr.
Bartley. Not only did Chancellor Posvar refuse
on a number of occasions to confer with him,
but Dr. Posvar also exposed the contents of a
personal letter directed to him by Bartley to the
University Times and offered a retort to it-.

Dr. Bartley furthermore claims that he .

was offered a bribe. He owns a home that is lo-
cated across the street from the proposed con-
struction site. The University suggested that it
purchase his home and property for a 15-20
per cent premium and rezone it as well. “There
are state laws prohibiting such action,” added
Bartley.

“The biggest problem is that the University
has such enormous political weight that a ques-

tion of how effective any community can be in-

the face of a super-corporation like "Pitt arises,”
he concluded. _ ‘

Orientation Rekindles ROTC Controversy

News Analysis: Student Misconceptions Surround Military Issue

by DIANN E ULYON
Staff News Writer

“First you deny ROTC credit and now you are deny-

_ ing them money for their military ball.” This statement

by a Student Government senator during the discussion
of the ROTC Brigade allocation typifies the current mis-
conceptions surrounding the ROTC issue.

ROTC is a recognized academic program on the un-
dergraduate level, but students in the College of Arts and
Sciences do not receive credits for = ' ' .
ROTC courses. After two weeks of in
terviews it is apparent that the fac- 
ulty and administration ‘have a clear ’

 

dents see the issue outside the Univer-
sity context.

__ Freshmen orientation and the fall
liberal arts program are the current
issues for those involved. Because
ROTC is an academic program, be-
cause other academic courses are pre-

sentedto the freshmen (Bauman has reported the facts

incorrectlyin his letter.) and because the freshmen regis-
ter for fall during orientation, ROTC is being included in
the schedule. If there is any question about ROTC’s relev-
ance to a University community, this should be raised on
the second day during the orientation panel “Issues-
’69.”

Students have failed to see the case as it is. To call
ROTC an extra-curricular activity is a blindness befit-
ting a close-minded conservative. Before fighting the pro-
gram as an extra-curricular one, the students involved

 We're Individuals!

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

Last Saturday, I went to the Carnegie Library to
get a card. While filling the card out, it hit me for the very
first time that I am a student at Pitt. Right therein ink it
said? Student, University of Pittsburgh‘, and suddenly I
realized that although I had written and said it for two
years, I was actually a student here.

Possibly my thought process for four years (that of
being proud that I never actually felt like a member of the

 .U.S. Air Force, although I was) had conditioned me
- _. against-the status of my current situation.

But upon further recollection, I remembered that I

' never actually felt like I was a student in high school, or a
. ‘V caddy, or a paper boy, or anything (even a little league
‘:_ ‘baseball player). ‘ -

I had always imagined how it would be or feel to be
something, and by the time I realized that it wasn't really
that way, I was no longer that something.

In other words, by the time I overcame all my
preconceptions about certain roles in life, I no longer

occupied these roles.

But what I think build up to Saturday’s realization is a
combination of things I have though about for the past two
years.

The most important thing is that every individual is
different than the next, yet the same as the next. Everyone
has a mind, a personality, an outward appearance,
feelings, ideas, and ways of expressing their thoughts. But
as these, and other human qualities, make us all the same,
they also make us different.

In addition to this human element, I’ve though a lot
about society and God in the past two years. Bot (by God I
mean organized religion, Catholic in particular) tend to
urge the individual toward groups, categories, and
classifications that bear names, and this is supposed to be

. what the individual is. '

For example, how does it feel to be a white, middle-
class, Protestant, Rebublican, executive? Now. there
must be millions of them in the world, but it seems that
somewhere I hav_e been taught that if I were one of these
(or any other possible combination) I would feel a certain
way.

To me, the thing that makes life the way it is, both
good and bad, right and wrong, is the fact that each
individual feels differently, although his tags may read the
same as the next guy.

The other thing I’ve though a lot about is the little I
have learned about psychology. Motivation, personality
development, approach-avoidance conflicts and things like
that fascinate me. I could discuss heredity vs.
environment for days. V

So. How does it feel to be a student at Pitt?
The answer is this:

I can't quite explain it to myself (although I can say it
is greatly different than my preconceptions), and I could
never: explain it too you. And even if I could, I’m sure you’d
feel differently.

   
 
 
 
  

should direct their efforts toward changing its current
academic legitimacy. ROTC will never be scratched from
the orientation calendar on the basis that it is an extra-
curricular activity. Any student searching for the truth
will realize this.

In September the Department of Military Science
hopes to have an acceptable alternative to the old pro-
gram for the College. The Department Co-ordinator Rich-
ard Rose is negotiating with military officials to find a
suitable alternative. The University is proposing that cur-
rently offered courses be defined suitably by the mili-
tary. It is hoped that many of the military specialized
courses can be incorporated into the summer camp. This
proposal has been submitted to a faculty committee for
its opinion, however, Rose’s negotiations are indepen-

. dent of any faculty concern.

Dr. Richard Cottam and Dr. Joseph Zasloff, both of

the Political Science Department, are co-chairing this '

committee. The committee intends to “recommend var-
ious alternatives for ROTC without credit,” according to
Dr. Cottam. Hearings will be scheduled to allow represen-

Freshmen Look At ROTC

by SCOTT BAUM
Student Government President

“Speak and ye shall be heard” seems to be the preach-
ment on campus these days. That may well be true, but
what you hear in return is another matter completely.‘
What follows is as factual an account-as I can render of
what happens when one is heard, you may draw your own
conclusions.

Somewhere in mid—May, there was a meeting of those
responsible for Freshman Orientation, student and admin-
istration. Joe Kocuibes as Cabinet chairman was there to
present an experimental orientation program to run sim-
ultaneously with the regular program. After we discuss-
ed that issue, I raised the problem of ROTC, which bears
no credit for Arts and Sciences students, still being re-
tained on the schedule in a session given by military peo-
ple when other extra-curricular activities are not granted
this right. The group was in agreement, as least tacitly,
that ROTC should be removed and CAS Dean Schneewind
instructed the Student Government Undergraduate Ori-
entation Committee accordingly. End of first scene.

Very soon I was informed that the Chancellor had re-
versed Schneewind’s decision. As the Dean put it, he was .
“summoned” to Posvar’s office and there told that ROTC
would be replaced on the schedule his objections not with-
standing. ‘I proceeded to meet with Mr. Freeman, secre-
‘tary of the ‘University,-to talk about the decision. He ela-
borated on thedecision and, importantly, pointedout that
Schneewind had asked that the meeting be called for his
own reasons. At that point, very much confused, I con-
fronted Schneewind with Freeman’s statement that he
(Schneewind) had called the meeting. The Dean, however,
remained adamantand added that Gow’s (acting Dean of

FAS) secretary has called him to notify him of. the ’

meeting. It’s not likely he would do that without a
directive from Dean Gow. ‘

I contacted Assistant Chancellor Jack Critchfield
who had been out of town, but whose understanding was
that Schneewind insisted on the meeting to resolve the
problem of ROTC concerning prospective Educatiorfand
Pharmacy students who can recieve credit toward gradu-
uation for ROTC, even though their first two years are
spent in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Two ‘issues are involved. First, the Student Govern-
ment Orientation Committee is ostensibly entrusted with
the power to make decisions concerning Freshman Orien-
tation, they were not consulted in the Chancellor’s dec-
sion, although later I was told by Freeman that the Chan-
cellor was merely expressing his viewpoint and would wel-
come discussion by the committee and myself. This, of
course, after the decision to reintroduce ROTC on the pro-

gram. Second there is a problem of conflicting reports on _

the events. ‘I am sure I could have received a number of
slightly different versions of the story had I solicited
them. It is of great importance to know who can be trust-
ed and who can’t, and, very frankly, that is the issue
here. Administrators should not be surprised at student
mistrust after incidents similar to the one I have just
described. I don’t know who is culpable in this crime of
credibility, but I know that it does not facilitate student-
administration relations when a student can’t be sure if
he is being dealt with honestly. “Speak and ye shall be
heard”—sometimes. what the hell for.

tation to all points of view. The committee, which in-
cludes students, has been selected on the basis that all
points of view he represented in its membership.

When asked about the committee’s reaction to Rose’s
proposal Dr. Cottam coolly remarked, “We thanked them
for letting us see it.” The committee’s intentions to fully
research the alternatives before making it-s recommenda-
tion to the faculty could jeopardize their effectiveness.
An alternative must be ready by September. The commit-
tee does not anticipate any recommendation until late fall
or winter. Though the faculty research may be more thor-
ough, the co-ordinator of the Department of Military Sci-
ence is already negotiating his alternative.

Whatever the outcome of Rose’s proposal or the fac-

ulty recommendations there is a question of whether or» '

not the proposals require faculty approval. The Acting
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Steele Gow feels
“until the Cottam—Zas1off committee makes .a recom-
mendation there is nothing to act on.” He adds that the
“concept” of any ROTC substitute program should be ap-
proved by the faculty. Since Rose’s proposal does not call
for new courses in the College, the faculty would not have
to act upon it. t A

Yet the Dean-Elect of the College of Arts and Sciences
Jerome Schneewind defines the proposal as an interde-
partmental course. “If they (ROTC) want a listing in the
bulletin” it will have to approved by the faculty. Further
confusion is anticipated since the students do not even
realize that their arguments are based on false ‘grounds.
If students continue to define ROTC as an extra-curricu-
lar activity, and should they attempt to protest any sub-
stitution to ROTC on those grounds; their efforts will
dead end and an issue will be created when one does not
exist. Let us hope the next outcry against ROTC shall

\

stand on a better foundation, for the sake of those who-5??’

simply observe the rhetoric and to offset the frustration
of those involved.

Posvor Reply NG--SDS  

Chancellor Posvar:

Jack Critc_hfield’s letter of June 6 in reply to our -re-’
quest is unsatisfactory on several counts. Most impor-
tantly he does not even answer our request that informa-

tion on the alternatives to ROTC and the draft be included

in the Freshman Orientation program.

Critchfield implies that the position of ROTC on cam-
pus is analogous to that of other academic programs. We
cannot accept this analysis. In the first place, it must be
pointed out that the other academic programs do not use
freshman orientation to gain recruits to their respective
disciplines.-We have yet to find History, Mathematics or
Philosophy on the orientation week agenda, so that, even
if the College of Arts and Sciences did grant credit for
ROTC, we still find no cause for its appearance on the
"program. ' ‘

On the other hand, one could claim that Critchfield .

did not . formulate

The question then becomes one of justifying ROTC’s very
existence, or at least its privileged status in relation to
the other alternatives to the draft, such as Officer Candi-
date School, National Guard, alternative service, draft re-
sistance, etc. In other words, we are back to our orig-
inal request.

To summarize, then, we can find no justification-
either in logic or in p,rinciple—-for ROTC to monopolize the
state during freshman orientation. For the University to
turn incoming students over to Colonel Clagett for guid-
ance on military service (which, setas it is in the context.
of orientation proceedings, carries with it the Universi-
ty’s seal of approval) is, perhaps, comparable to appoint-
ing Strom Thurmond to a position in a Black Studies De-
partment.

Yours for bread and roses,

should have said that ROTC is indeed a special privileges.” ‘

Chems Clash
For Hall— Title

Two grad teams are the only
survivors in the battle for the
first half championship of the
summer softball intramural com-
petition. Only one of them, either
the Chems or the M. B. A. -Blues,
will be alive after today’s 5:30
encounter for the title at the All-
Purpose Fields behind Trees Hall.

The Chems qualified ‘for the
big game in a rather easy manner,
defeating their opposition in all
five outings. The latest triumph
was an 8-0 blanking of the Char-
ley Browns.

There was a bit more labor in-—
volved, however, in the Blues’
‘climb towards the showdown.
They had to play seven games to
get there, and it was their 10-2
victory over Delta Sigma Phi
last week that finally clinched the
spot. The Blues record is 6-1.

Winning the title won’t mean
the summer championship for to-
day’s winner. The second half of
the schedule is underway, and a
second-half title game will be
played after that session ends
Augustl.

Fourteen teams are aiming for
that meeting, including the two
teams who are dueling in today’s
tilt. Director of intramurals Leo
Bemis hopes that the champs of
each half of the schedule will be
able to meet for the over-all hon-
ors later in August. Of course,
he won’t have to worry about
scheduling that game if today’s
winner repeats its efforts through
the summer’s second season.

Any area track buffs planning to be on hand in Knoxville, Tennessee, for this weekend’s
NCAA Meet will have to take a good hard look around if they hope to spot any of Jim Banner’s
delegation to the annual affair. The thinclads, for the second consecutive week, willbe repre-
sented only by Jerry Richey, Bryant Salter and Dan Kouvolo. -

6 This past weekend at the National Federation Meet in Lexington, Lentucky, the trackmen had their
ups and downs. The men of Banner, competed in the mile, the triple jump, and the javelin. ‘

Jerry Richey provided the thinclads with their only real moment of success as he placed second be-
Phil i
Robinson in the mile. Robinson,
a sub four-minute miler. trailed
Richey until the final ten" yards
of the race, but then added a final
burst of speed to edge out the jun-

done any speedwork for a while,”
remarked-.Banner. “We want-
ed to use this race as a condition-
er for the three-mile race he'll
be running at the NCAA’s next
weekend.” . .

Richey’s mile race this past
weekend marked the first time
in over a month that the versa-
tile thinclad had run that distance.
For the past several weeks, Rich-
ey had been entered in middle and
long distance runs, a type of race
which demands a greater
measure of endurance than blind-
ing speed.

Richey must feel a bit more at
home in ' the middle distance
races. Only two and a half weeks
ago, Jerry captured the top spot

in the IC4A’s three-mile ‘rac
and this weekend he is once aga ,
entered in the three-miler at the
NCAA’s. '
