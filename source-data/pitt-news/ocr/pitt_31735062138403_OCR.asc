THE DAVIS

 

A decidedly popular star is herald-
ed ‘as the chief attraction in the
Keith vaudeville shows which are to
be given at the Davis Theater at
daily matinees and evening perform-
ances tor one week, beginning Mon-
day afternoon, May 10. There are
to be nine varied acts. With Madame
Emma Trentini, the diminutive and
popular star of grand opera and
-opera comique, in‘the titular posi-
tion. It will «be Tre,ntini’s ﬁrst and
perhaps only appearance here in the
two-a-day, for she is fulﬁlling just
now a few ad interi engagements
prior to beginning rehearsal for a
new production in the coming sum-
mer. But recently returned from
Europe, where, in London and
throughout Italy, she sang in grand
opera, Trentini preferred an excur-
sion into‘ vaudeville rather than a.
venture ‘so late in the season in
light opera. She is affectionately
remembered by t-heatergoers locally
as the star of "The Fireﬂy” and
“Naughty Marietta,” in 'both of
which productions her engaging per-
sonality and vocal gifts ﬁrmly estab-
lished her in the esteem of discrim-
inating theatergoers. Treintini is
rarely endowed, possessing ability to
act and the talent for song, attrib-
utes not commonly united in a sin-
gle prima donna.

 

THE GRAND.

A land of exotics, beauty and ro-
mance-—the glistening‘ isles of the
South Seas—has been chosen by
David W. Griffith as the scene for
his latest great drama, ‘The Idol
Dancer," produced with an all-star
cast, which will top the program
New Million Dollar
Grand all next week, starting Mon-
day morning. in this land of the
far-away, a veritable port of the
missing, where hide the rebellious,
the ‘outlaw and the heathen, he has
placed a wonderful story of romance
and adventure-—a vivid tale of life
and love, sadness and laughter, sloth
and work, sanity and madness,

_ treachery and honesty, laxity and

manliness.

 

OLYMPIC

 

After having been -presented in re-
roles Eugene
O'Brien now dips lightly into comedy
in the new Selznick Picture, "A Fool
and His Money,” written by George
Barr Mccutcheon, which opened a
week's engagement at the Olympic
Theater last Monday, May 3.

In this play Mr. O'Brien appears as
an American author who buys an old
castle on‘ the Danube, in order to get
atmosphere for his new novel, as well

' as peace and quiet.

He appears to be badly stung on the

, deal, but things turn out even better

than expected, as.a.' charming ghost
appears on the scene, and enough en-
grossing adventures follow to make
him wonder whether it isn't only a
novel, after all. A ﬁght with a vil-
lanous nobleman and a chase over
the snow-covered hills convince him it
isn't all make-believe, and the ﬁnal re-

- assurance is when he clasps the fair
j heroine in his arms.

“A Fool and His Money" is light

2 comedy mixed with drama, and pre-
E sented among the most picturesque
. settings, with a complete transfer of

"; The plan proposed; by students at a neighboring University that
 fshall wear overalls is worth» ‘discussing in al.l seriousness. To
whom‘ should the "leadership in the attack upon the H. c. L’. fall, if
tto, the students of the nation‘? . The good that ‘a demonstration of
hissortl could accomplish if universally accepted by college students
 be immeasurable. Such action couldynotfail to make an im-
‘4 iession upon those modern robber barons, the clothingdealers.
A The report from New York that a large clothing ﬁrm has reduced
. rices-from 20% toj30% and, of‘course,’is still able to make a rea-
sonable proﬁt, has invited the comment of editorial writers the coun-
-try. over who inquire as to the extent of the proﬁt before the reduc-
on was made. «An overall campaign is not meant to continue, per-
anently- Its promoters do not ﬂean to make the blue goods the
fashionable dress. The value in the adoptionof such garb as- the
latest spring innovation would be to show clothing men that the
...people of the nation have awakened to therealization that extortion
-‘has been the rule and that they are determined that the holdup‘sha.ll

‘eds have taken gingham goods as the standard for dress mate_rial.

of the usual goods andso ,mitigat'el the beneﬁts of the drive arenot

f. The kinds of clothes worn by s. ofcial groups in societ, are me«1iely,
_,a part of the traditions‘ of those: groups. If s*o_methir'i.g‘:happiencd’i"sl0,;
«."1;l:).7€i.l2 overalls" suddenly »b‘ecam‘e pfricieless, this.sort'Vof._cloth'ing would
;then be regarded as the ‘mark of tlieman who-has ahliieved success
f_-1n.the world.‘ It would be-the only proper dress. Were evening
j lothes to be adopted by -ditch-diggers as the customary raiment of
7;such workers, that type of dresswould then be ‘automatically dropped
‘iffrom all social functions. Itwould have ceased toibe the badge of
fthe group. ‘All such conventions are only a, matter of custom.
 Let us then suppose that by virtue of necessity, in order,to stop
ices in their ever faster upward swing, to change itheitrend of af-
"fairs, ‘it becomes necessary to temporarily overthrow the ' custom.’
‘$om.e _customs are founded upon the proprieties and others »have,tra-
ditionlas their source. ii Now whether man wears armor, silk, broad-
Gl;o.th, serge or blue jeans depends upon the social tradition of that
generation, the fashion of the moment. To change ‘from the ordinary
iiiclothing of the -time, provided that the new wearing apparel is as
eful as the old and suifers» only because people haveinot hitherto
garded it as acceptable, involves nothing which conﬁicts with in-

,_ in bio attempt is here made to suggest.that”such h ‘scheme be NOW
adopted at Pitt. But Pitt men and women should at least be made
;a9ware~ of the fact that their contemporaries in the college world have

a melody that will cause the orchestra

MUSIII TRANSMITTER
  HALF MILE BY RAIIIIT

Pitt students danced Saturday night

 

 

 in Heinz House to the music of an
f orchestra which played half a mile
- away in Central Hall of the Carnegie

Institute of Technology. Transmitted
from the one hall to the other by
radio the music served well for two
dances. ‘

The dance’ was given by Prof. a.nd
Mrs. H. S. Scribner in honor of the
Alpha Xi Delta fraternity. Members
of Sigma Kappa Pi also were guests.

Prof. Edwin R. Rath of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, sitting in the ex-
periment station of the University,
heard? Tech music and conceived the
idea of transferring it by the use of
a magnavox and two strings of elec-
tric wires to the Heinz House. The
Pitt experiment station is nearly a
half mile from the Tech Central Hall.

The magnavox, Prof. Rath explained,
is an instrument which was used
widely in military operations to in-
rease the sound from a radio receiver.
Pitt students, when informed that
music was being provided in Heinz
House, hurried there to dance. “It
was far better than dancing to a
graphaphone,”-one of them said. “The
only objectionable part of it was that
the jazz of the drums was destroyed.
Evidently the receiver on our end
wasn’t adjusted
waves but those of
stringed instruments.”

PHARMACY

One of the most pleasing entertain-
ments of the year was" given last
evening in '03 Hall, Pittsburgh College
Pharmacy, by the Lambda Kappa Sig-
ma Sorority. The feature of the even-
ing was a well given play entitled
“The Sweet Family.” So well were
the players masqueraded that up to
date it has been impossible to learn
the indentity of the actors.

The ones responsible for the de-
lightful evening were Miss Florabel
Wood, Miss Rita Troilo, Miss Thelma
Carr, Miss Bessie Swartz, Miss Goldie
Snyder, Mrs. Helen Nied, Miss Helen
Nahar. A delightful luncheon was
served after the play.

Roy H. Heiser, Ph. G., '10, assisted

Night quizzes are being held at the
School of Pharmacy, Monday, Wednes-
day and Friday evenings. The classes
are well attended.

A “Tin Foil Campaign” has been
inaugurated at the School of Pharm-
acy by Dr. Blumenschein for the pur-
pose of furthering the move of the
new Pharmacy Building on the Cam-
pus. The average pharmacy student
is in a position to acquire quite a lot
of tin foil and no doubt the big con-
tainer in the hallway will soon be
overﬂowing with the .lustrous metal,
which in turn will buy ‘bricks for the
new building. '

Also Creme Alure is still fighting for
the new pharmacy building. Up to
date it has provcn its worth in the
ﬁght for the new building by the
amount of the product that is being
sold. Each package of Creme Alure
represents a brick in the new pharm-
acy buildling.

All is in readiness for the Detroit
trip. _ .

Banquet arrangements have all been
completed. Let’s- go for one grand
big good time before we part.

Illness of Martin Handicaps
I ‘Pitt Runners in Penn’s Big
Carnival. Brickle y and
Wiegel Ran Steady-—La-
I fayette Next

 

.. The relay team came in fourth in
, the Class B event at the Penn Relay
'I_Carn'ival last Friday and Saturday.
17 The Panthers were pitted against a
fast ﬁeld of starters and were up
against some classy competition. But
for Ma.rtin’s unfortunate race, Shea
' would have pushed the winners hard
on the last quarter. Martin, through
R illness‘ or lameness or some other
'ca'l1‘se,‘ failed miserably in the ﬁrst
, quarter. Counted upon to ﬁnish well
R “up ‘ front in the ﬁrst relay, he passed
, the -'baton to Brickley in the next to
1 last position, having run in 55 4-5 sec-
, onds when he is capable of doing
,4 50 4-5, a difference of about 30 yards.
' I Brickley and Wiegel bot.h ran steady
. «races, the former in 53 1-5 seconds and
 the.Panther captain in 52 3-5, sending
. ‘Shea off in sixth place. Shea had no
diﬂiculty‘ in passing the Penn State
. and West Virginia men, but to over-
, take the other three men was a. hope-
less task. His time was 49 2-5, and he
“ -could have clipped some from this, had
there. been any possibility’ of catch-
ing the other men. ' --
7 ‘fRedlands University of California
won the race in the fast time of
03:25‘ 2-5, breaking the record for this
event made by Pitt in 1918. Syracuse
‘University was a close second and
' Columbia ‘third. Not far behind Shea
.was the West Virginia man, with Penn
State ﬁnishing sixth.
Some of the other events brought
forth results that should be of inter-
~ . est to Pitt track followers. The one-
mile relay championship of America.
was won by Pennsylvania. The two-
mile international relay was -captured
by the combined Oxford-Cambridge
team in world’s record time. Old Penn
also took the sprint medley.
j » Poor as was their ﬁnish in the Class
- I. B relay, Penn State made a. wonder-
, stul showing in the meet, winning both
 ‘ the distance medley and the four-mile
, -American championship. In addition
{their men scored heavily in the indi-
 " vidual events. W. & J. ﬁnished rather
’ ” poorly in the Middle States champion-
-~ ship. West Virginia, of course, beat
out Penn State in the Class: B relay.
so that their showing was very credit-
able. ’
The relays brought forth two star
quarter-milers, who are likely to push

quarter-mile. The first is Driscoll,
formerly of the Irish-American A. C.
‘and a. well-known performer, who is
now attending Boston College, which
was just admitted to the I. C. A. A.
A. A. this year. The other is Maxim’,
a. Penn phenom., who ran the fastest
quarter of the meet. in 48 4-5 seconds.
_ In addition Penn has Gustafson, who
iscapable of doinga 49 second quar-
ter, but at present he has a pulled
tendon, which may possibly keep him

Penn State’s baseball team picks
anchor and goes on a Northern trip
this week. Swathmore is the only
team that the Mt. Nittany boys meet

 

similar jaunt later in the season.

Carnegie Tech opens their home
season tomorrow. We understand that
the Tartans have quite some team.

 

Bob Higgins, Captain of the State
football team last season, will oﬁiciate
as head coach down at West Virginia
Wesleyan next year. -

 

West Virginia University will meet
both Fordham and Georgetown this
week. The Panthers will hook up with
both of these teams on the Eastern so-
journ.

any other events. They were entered
in the sprint medley championship,
but as there was a cold, pdrizzling rain
falling. Coach Kerr decided it would
be ‘unwise to risk Shea’s and Martin’s
legs and run any chanceof theirstif
fening before the more important re-
lay the next day. No Pitt runner took
part in any individual’ events.

The extra man to make the trip was
Wakeﬁeld. He is a New Kensington
boy and a Sophomore Engineer. He
was the real dark horse of the trials.
He never ran a quarter-mile in his
life before he competed in the ﬁrst
trials and had worn a track shoe but
a. few times, although he had never
run in a meet. In his ﬁrst trial heat
he ﬁnished second to Shea in just as
fast time as was made by Brickley,
Bovard and Peters. He hung‘ on to
Shea for 300 yards, a feat never before
accomplished by a Pitt track man.
However, he set too fast a pace and
weakened terribly at the ﬁnish. In
the ﬁnal trials for fourth man he ran
a dead heat with Brickley and, had he
been more experienced, he should have-
won. In the relay at Philadelphia
Coach Kerr ran Brickley on account of
his experience. Had Wakeﬁeld had
even a. couple of weeks’ training he
could have made the team easily. He
knows little or nothing about the track
game, but certainly has remarkable
possibilities.

The team has now to head for the
Lafayette meet’ this Saturday at
Easton. From their showing in the
Penn relays Lafayette is exceptionally
strong this year, and will make a
tough foe, especially under the point
system to be used, 5 for ﬁrst and 3 for
second, third place not scoring. About
14 men will be taken on the trip and
try-outs for doubtful positions will be
held tomorrow afternoon. Following
the Lafayette meet is the- Navy meet
at Annapolis, May 15, which will mean

BIIRRY’S‘ INIIIRY‘ HURTS
PITT IN PRESS MEET

From the standpoint of the point-
score, Pitt's showing in the Press
meet was anything but impressive, but
in a handicap meet, point-scores and
places don't mean much. Of course,,
ﬁve good men, who should have been
point-scorers, were at the Penn relays,
so that the. Panthers were not at their
top strength. Pitt was credited with
four-thirds for a total of four points in
the whole meet. Without knocking or
alibiing it seems as though the handi-
capper thinks every Pitt man is a
Shea and a. world-beater and, there-
fore,’ should be on the scratch. The
result is that Pitt men are so handi-
capped that it is impossible for them
even to place. Such, for example, was
the case with Klingensmith and Bo-
vard in the mile. They ran pretty
races, but could not overcome the
handicaps given their opponents. Oth-
er examples could be cited where Pitt
men performed well, but could not
place.

The relay team, composed of Capers,
Bovard, Manderville and Allen, was a
third in that event. Capers, after
ﬁnishing third in his heat in the 100-
yard dash, _also took third in the ﬁnal.
Rylander and Pyle both ﬁnished third
in their heats in the 100, but did not
place in the ﬁnal. Third place in the
quarter went to Gerald Allen, and Bill
Potter got the last point with a third
in the mile. .

The meet, from Pitt’s standpoint.
was marred by the unfortunate injury
to Blaine Curry, sustained in the fall,
after clearing the bar in the pole vault
at about 11 feet. His arm is fractured.
but the exact extent of his injury is
unknown. Whether he will be out all
season or not is problematical, and
cannot be determined yet. .If he is out
for good or even for just a couple’ of
weeks, his accident is a. sad blowlto
the team. Few men were so depend-
ed upon, for his loss leaves the team
practically without a pole-vaulterland
high-jumper. Here’s hoping he comes
around in time for the Penn State and
West Virginia meets.

TENNIS TEAM WILL  
ﬂPEN_Sl_;‘A_3llN mm

The ﬁrst practice of the season was
held by the tennis team on the Univer-
sity courts on Thackeray street on
Monday afternoon last. The team —has
practiced every day since, and Coach
Dr. Stephen has spared no pains to
whip the men into shape for the
match with Thiel College today on tﬁe
P. A. A. courts. _

With such stars as Smith, Lewis,
Merritt, Monk and Schmertz back
from last year’s team the outlook for
the racqueters is rather bright. Doane,
the former Allegheny star, showed up
well in the practices and the coach is
looking him over with expectant eyes.
Several other men who did not -cpm-
pete last year were out and they all
showed promise. With these men at
his service and all working with a de-
termination the coach looks forward
to one of the most successful years
the University has ever had in tennis.
The match scheduled with Grove
City on May 8 promises to be a severe
test for the Panthers, as Grove City
has an expert bunch of racquet wield-
ers, and there is surely no soft snap
looked for.

“Billy” McElroy, former Pitt tennis
star, has offered his services in as-
sistlng Dr. Stephen to bring the men
to tip-topshape. With wea.ther.condi-
tions improving and practices acquir-
ing a serious aspect the men will soon
be lit to ﬁght all comers, and carry
the Blue and Gold colors high.
