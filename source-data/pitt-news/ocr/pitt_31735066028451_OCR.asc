Chancellor Mark Nordenberg was
approved for the ﬁrst-ever incentive-
based bonus for a Pitt. chancellor at
Tuesday’s Compensation Committee
meeting. The committee is a subcom-
mittee of the University’s Board of
Trustees.

The Board of Trustees offered a
bonus of up to $30,000, based on his
performance in ﬁve separate areas of
Pitt’s institutional advancement.

“The decision of the compensation
committee today was to award the full
$30,000,” ‘said Pitt spokesman Ken
Service last night.

According to Board Chairman J .W.
Connolly, “The decision to award the
full amount of the incentive recognizes
the significant and rapid progress that
has been made in the areas of emphasis.

,“Mark Nordenberg has done a very
good job of moving this University
ahead in critical areas,” Connolly said.

Rumor has it that Benedum Hall is
making a snai1‘s pace descent, at a rate of
about an inch per year, down Thackeray
and Bouquet Streets. _

Psst here’s the real scoop:
Benedum Hall is not sliding down the hill
that fast. In fact, it’s not even moving.

- According to top officials supervising
the current construction outside Benedum

Plaza — including the foreman of the
construction, the assistant chief of engi-
neering of Pittsburgh's Building

Inspections Bureau and Pitt’s facilities
management — the structure is stable.
"It's a very solid structure. You could
even drive a fire truck onto the plaza as
far as I'm concerned," said Sergio
Lazzaris, foreman of the construction

Some engineering students say this construction is to prevent the
building from sliding off its foundation. It's really iust to fix some leaks.

Pltt officals
expect tuition
inflation to slow

Brett Taylor
Staff Writer

The University’s governmental-
relations department submitted its
annual budget request for the 1999
fiscal year to the Pennsylvania
Department of Education last week.

If all goes well, the request will
equate to the smallest annual tuition
hike in recent years.

The University's tuition has
increased 4.5 percent all of the past
three years.

According to Bill Madden,
director of Pitt’s budget, planning
and analysis, a lower-than-usual
tuition hike is contingent on whether
the state allocates all the money that
the University has requested.

"Typically, we get significantly
less than needed from the state,"
Madden said.

However, according to Dennis
McManus, an official with Pitt’s
govemmental-relations department,
this year is different.

"The University has a better-
than-usual chance of getting the
money it requested, because they
did not request as much money as in
previous years," McManus said.

Although McManus did not

.. have the speciﬁc ﬁgures contained

in Pitt’s request available at the time
of this interview, he said he was
confident that this request could be
met.

"There have been many years
that we've requested amounts in the
double digits," McManus said. "We
usually got significantly less than
we requested in those years.

"I feel optimistic that with the
proposal we have made that we have
a good chance to get all the money
we have requested." ‘

According to Madden, the
University gets its financial
resources from student administra-
tive fees and from commonwealth
appropriations. ‘

This year, Pitt has requested a
3.5—percent increase in allocation
from the state for basic funding, plus
an additional 5-percent increase in a
fund known as “Initiatives for
Competitiveness.”

These initiatives include

Immigration reform might mean
end of INS, Congress says

Across the Nation

ROCKPORT, Maine — The
Coalition of Northeastern Governors is
meeting in Rockport.

Representatives of nine states
began a two-day conference yesterday
to discuss a wide range of issues facing
Northeastern states —— including utility
deregulation and regional economic
trends.

One of the high points of the event
has been a roundtable discussion enti-
tled “Ideas That Work.” The discussion
focused on changes in how public ser-
vices and goods are delivered.

The coalition represents the states
of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island.

BOSTON — Police say they are inves-
tigating the alcohol-related death of a
student at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology as a homicide. 1

Scott Krueger died Monday after
spending three days in an alcohol-
induced coma following a fraternity
party.

He was found Friday at the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity "house in
Boston with his heart stopped. Police
say vomit and empty liquor bottles
were found
Krueger’s parents say his blood alcohol
was ﬁve times the legal limit. .

“The incident has prompted institute
ofﬁcials to review their alcohol policy
and consider banningalcohol campus-
wide. The fraternity, in the meantime,
remains suspended. C

WASHINGTON — Immigration
reform will require the breakup of the
Immigration and Naturalization

Service, according to a report released
yesterday by Congress. The report was
made by the U.S. Commission on

in Krueger’s room. ’

Immigration Reform.

The chair of the commission says
the INS is suffering from “mission
overload.” Shirley Hufstedler says that
no one agency can do everything that is
now expected of the INS.

The commission is recommending
that the duties of the INS be divided
among other Federal agencies. It ‘-has
suggested that the Department of
Justice retain authority for controlling
theborder and removing illegal immi-
grants and the Department of State
oversee services like citizenship appli-
cations.

A newly created agency for immi-
gration review would hear appeals and
the Department of Labor would be
charged with enforcing laws governing
the hiring of foreign workers.

CHICAGO -— There will soon be
male waiters at Hooters restaurants
nationwide. The Chicago Sun-Times
reports Hooters has agreed to pay $3.7
million to settle a sex-discrimination
lawsuit ﬁled by men. Hooters is a
restaurant best known for its scantily-
clad servers. '

CAPITOL HILL — The Senate plans
a ﬁnal vote today on a measure that will
keep federal agencies running while
Congress ﬁnishes work on spending
legislation.

The 1998 ﬁscal year begins today.

The emergency legislation is need-
ed because Congress has sent only
three of the 13 armual spending bills to
the White House. The U.S. House over-
whelmingly passed the Stop-Gap Bill
on Monday afternoon, 355-57.

The bill temporarily ﬁnances pro-
grams at 1997 levels, except for those
that lawmakers and the president have
agreed to cut.

The two parties are cooperating,
thanks to their budget truce with
President Clinton.

TUITION

$1,750,000 for instructional technolo-
gy, $2,l59,000 for lab modernization,
$2,500,000 for infrastructure modem-
ization and $1,250,000 for student
competitiveness.

Madden said Pitt formulates these
proposals by examining the previous
year's expenditures and what purchas-
es need to be made to operate for the
year. After the University decides how
much funding it requires, the common-
wea1th's Relations Department submits
the request to the Pennsylvania
Department of Education.

There, according to McManus, the
executive branch comes up with its

FROM PAGE 1

budget plan; the governor then pre-
sents his budget address to the General
Assembly. After the address, both
houses of the assembly hear from rep-
resentatives of the groups requesting
allocations and decide what each
group’s budget should be.

Once the General Assembly con-
curs on a budget, it presents its plan to
the governor —— who has the opportu-
nity to accept or veto the proposal.

The ﬁnal decision on how much
Pitt will get will not be known until
February 1998 at the earliest.

The lower tuition increase would
go into effect in September 1998.

example.

J. Dennis O’Connor, Pitt’s chancel-
lor from 1991 until 1995, told the
trustees shortly before he stepped down
that they hadn’t adequately set -goals for
him. Within 14 months, the trustees had
set five goals for Nordenberg — then
just completing his third month as Pitt’s
chancellor.

Nordenberg served as interim chan-
cellor from July 1995, . the time
O’Connor left, until June 1996.

The committee also approved an
increase in salary for Nordenberg and
other senior ofﬁcers of the University at
the meeting.

The chancellor’s salary rose 3.1
percent — from $225,000 to $232,000.

Based on recommendations from
Nordenberg, several senior Pitt ofﬁcers

were also approved for salary increases

THE PITT NEWS 3

by the board (see graph).

The overall salary increase in the
University budget for the current year
was 3.0 percent —— of which 2.0 percent
was awarded for “satisfactory perfor-
mance” and the remaining 1.0 percent
was given out for special merit recogni-
tion and equity adjustments. ‘

Connolly said that the chancellor’s
compensation is modest when com-
pared to those received by other univer-
sity presidents.

Carnegie Mellon University’s presi-
dent, Jared Cohon, earned $285,000 in
the 1996-1997 fiscal year and
Duquesne’s president, John Murray,
earned $319,000.

Nordenberg was unable to

occurring outside Benedum.

Lazzaris said the construction
going on right now is not related to any
shifts in the building's position. He said
workers are waterprooﬁng the plaza
and trying to fix existing leaks in a
common basement that links Benedum
Hall and Benedum Auditorium beneath
the plaza.

Dennis Moulton, assistant chief
engineer for the Bureau of Building
Inspection, said that the University has
permits for sprinkler and electrical
work inside Benedum and for rescaling
the roofing structure under the plaza.

With regards to Benedum sliding
down the hill, Moulton said,"If it is, we
haven't been notiﬁed. As far as we
know, that is not the case."

John Sopcisak of Facilities
Management seemed a little surprised
by the rumor and also upheld that
Benedum is not sliding down the hill.

"I've been here for 18 years and I
know of no such thing," he said. "It's

‘pretty stable."

Benedum Hall was completed in
1971. If the rumor was true, Sopcisak
said, the building would have already
slid 26 inches — more than two feet -
down the hill. That gradual motion of
the slide would have created a very
noticeable gap and signiﬁcant structur-
al damage to the two buildings that use
the plaza as a base.

Despite hearing confirmation of
the contrary, there are students who
believe the rumor. Damien Scott is one
of them.

"I heard this [rumor] a long time
ago, at least a year or two ago," said
Scott, a senior mechanical engineering
student. "I believe it. These things hap-
pen over time."

The rumor is concentrated mostly
in the ranks of upperclassman engi-
neering students. Scott said he recalled
hearing it first from a professor. Other

FROM PAGE 1

students said they have no idea where
they heard it ﬁrst, it's just one of those
things they had always known, a sort of
local legend that spread by word of
mouth.

Ray Fortuna, a senior computer
engineering major, thinks the rumor
has a slim chance of being true but says
it doesn't worry him.

"I'm outta here," he said, referring
to his upcoming graduation.

"If it was unsafe, I don't think
they'd let people in here  but maybe
they just can't afford to ﬁx it," he
joked.

Senior Jeff Mancuso put a different
spin on the rumor and maintained that
his version was the complete story in
its purest form.

"The rumor is this: Back when the
building was built, students designed it
and now it's sliding down the hill," said
the mechanical engineering major.

And to keep with the old Pitt tradi-
tion, if anything goes wrong, blame it
on Penn State, Mancuso added.

Actually, neither Pitt nor Penn
State students designed Benedum.

The building was designed by the
architectural firm Deeter and Ritchey
-- a firm now called DRS Hundley
Kling Gmitter Inc.

Bill Sippel, the design architect for
the building and partner in the ﬁrm, did
happen to earn his undergraduate
degree from Penn State, which could
be the seed that sprouted the rumor.

But Sippel said he harbors no ill
feelings toward Pitt which would have
inspired him to build Benedum so it
would eventually slip down from its
perch on O’Hara Street. In fact, he says
he even roots for Pitt teams, "except
when they play Penn State in football."

Sippel said he didn’t think there
was a chance that Benedum could be
slipping down towards Fifth Avenue.

“I sure as hell hope not,” he said.

Nordenberg’s bonus is unreal

Pi_tt’s trustees have given
Chancellor Nordenberg a 3.1-percent
raise, and a $30,000 bonus for doing
essentially what he’s supposed to do
anyway.

Consider the goals that the Board
of Trustees set for him a year ago:

0 fund-raising

- maintained research excellence

- operational efficiency

é community outreach

0 pursuit of undergraduate excellence

I.et’s look at these one by one,
shall we? . _ 0

Well, Nordenberg is certainly
working hard at fund-raising. He’s
made it his primary job. While respon-
sibility for education has fallen on

Provost Maher, and the image of the »

school rests in Steve Pederson’s hands,
our chancellor’s main job is hobnob-
bing with the rich folk and trying to get
gifts, endowments and other monies
for the school. It’s honestly a tough
job, and we don’t doubt that he’s doing
it well.

It’s everything else on the list with
which we take issue. '

Like maintained research excel-
lence, for example, which is really up
to the faculty of this University, not the
administration. And what’s with the
word maintained? Why not
improved? If everybody else in the
University has been offered a bonus
— a much smaller bonus, even rela-
tive to their salaries —— for going above
and beyond what is expected of them,

why should the chancellor be reward-
ed for what has already come to be
expected?

Actually, there’s not much to
argue about when it comes to opera-
tional efﬁciency. Nordenberg has, after
all, managed to keep a housekeeping
and maintenance staff with substan-
dard pay and without a contract for
almost two years now.

But community outreach? Yeah,
he almost reached the community with
the Bigelow Boulevard deal, right?

As for undergraduate excellence,
we’d like to know just how that’s
judged. What evidence do the trustees
have that shows whether undergradu-
ate excellence has been achieved? We
suppose that means undergraduate
education — or at least, we hope that’s
what it means, because it’s a very
ambiguous term. And we haven’t seen
a great improvement in undergraduate
education yet— the core curriculum
hasn’t actually been revamped. Even if
it were, there would be a few deans to
recognize for that. You don’t see them
getting $30,000 bonuses for their long
hours, do you?

The requirements set for the chan-
cellor look vague and undeﬁned. If
they had better-deﬁned descriptions,
we’d like to see them. Otherwise, it
looks like they were just a sham, an
excuse, and that there was never a pos-
sibility that N ordenberg wouldn’t get a
bonus larger than many University
workers’ salaries.

Addicted to the Magic of

’college fair’

The term “college fair” seemed
like a bit of an oxymoron, but I
decided to go anyway. .

After all, it was the last free-
sample fest to hit the Pitt campus
this semester, and it may very well
have been the last chance I’d get in
my life to get a free student-health
keychain.

The William Pitt Union lawn
looked like set—up time for the
Macy’s parade with those enormous
inﬂatable things that people get on
and then engage in activities that
would otherwise result in fractured
skulls strewn about the land.

These giant inﬂatable thingies -
which is apparently what they are
called in the traveling—fair biz —
also serve a secondary purpose:
advertising tools. A 30-square-foot
inﬂatable Trojan condom packet
erected behind the “Gladiator Duel”
stood as a stiff testament to that.

As I stood watching two students -

pummel each other with pugil sticks
that looked more like oversized, blue

Q-Tips, a stranger came up and

handed me a bag of sample—sized
items. (Sample—sized, by the way, is
a term agreed on by brand-name
manufacturers to mean “anything so
small that it would look actual sized
when placed in a Barbie Dream Doll
House.”)

In the bag were several items
including toothpaste, deodorant and
a Trojan “Ultra Pleasure” premium
latex condom. The doll house rule

marketing

 

didn’t apply to the condom, but there
was only one condom.‘

I’m not sure exactly what mes-
sage the promoters of the event were
trying to express with those little
sample bags, but the old childhood
axioms of “Don’t take candy from
strangers” and “Can I spent the night
at so—and—so’s house?” seemed’ to
assume a new and pretty warped
twist.

Some quick research revealed
that I had to sign a waiver and then
get a pretty-official-looking smiley-
face stamp before I could doany of
the potentially fatal game-type
things, like climb a plastic 28-foot
cliff face.

The waiver made it clear that by
signing it, I agreed to:

0 Not sue anybody for anything, even
in the event that a fair employee
were to pull out an elephant gun and
go on a “student safari.”

0 Allow the fair to reproduce my
image for its sales purposes without
my consent. Which means that if its
employees wanted to paste my face
on a nude picture of Drew Carey in
the middle of Times Square, they got

0 Swear to give my first-born son as

ple-sized—product manufacturing
plant, as well as my full estate to
the sponsors upon my death (my
estate, at this rate, will probably be
a pile of old free T-shirts from the
last three years of college fairs and
a small collection of Jimmy Buffett
albums).

I climbed the plastic cliff and
would have tried the “Sticky Wall”
attraction — in which students
wore a Velcro suit and jumped onto
a Velcro wall — but nobody actual-
ly made it to the wall, and I decid-
ed it’s probably good practice not
to try -‘anything called a “Sticky
Wall” at an event thatfeatures a 30-
foot condom. I

Somewhere near the center of
the fair was a booth where Wizards
of the West Coast Inc. was giving
out free starter packs of role—play-
ing game cards. (Though accepting
anything free from “wizards”
should probably trigger the same
apprehension in people as accept-
ing a book titled “Heaven’s Gate:
Make Your Next Trip With Us”
from a man dressed in an orange
sheet and black Nikes.)

Magic, for those of us who had
no idea that anything like this exist-
ed up to now, is a game in which
players use poker—type cards to
play a sort of Dungeons and
Dragons game. After getting started
with these free sets, players can go

get better cards than the company
gives them for free.

Essentially, the booth was serv-
ing the same role as your friendly
neighborhood crack dealer. _

The free “starter packs” should
indicate the potential danger they
pose by their name alone."

One person I walked by showed
the effects of Magic addiction, had
been camping beside the booth for
the past two days and had given up
some basic bodily functions — like
sleeping, bathing, eating or going
to the bathroom —-— to get more free
starter packs.

Person: “Dude, I really need anoth-
er fix. C’mon!”

Magic Guy: “Look, one per cus-

talking to? I am a Magic wizard,
and I will use my powers on
you!!!”

Police. Officer: “Chancellor
Nordenberg, I’m going to have to
ask you to let these people go now.
The fair is over.”

Well, marketers really have us
in the palm of their hands. It’s dis-
gusting.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I
need to find a place that isn’t sold
out of Magic booster packs.

without prior notice end up losing
their position without prior notice.

In my view, two unexcused
absences (which I allow in my

expected of ‘me as the instructor.
Since my class is a seminar for

Endangered
Owls will put
up a fight

A year ago last Sunday, the 1-3
Pitt Panthers’ football team traveled
south to Miami and was completely
humiliated by the Hurricanes 45-0.

Things have changed.

A year ago this Sunday, the 1-4
Pitt Panthers hosted the 1-3 Temple

Owls in a completely meaningless 0

game.

Boy, things have really changed.

This season, the Panthers are 3-1
going into a surprisingly important
Temple game.

The Owls have resembled a
respectable team this season, even
though their record stands at 1-4.
Temple defeated Boston College for
only their second Big East victory in
the six years of the conference and
lost to Virginia Tech by only 10
points. .

Coming off consecutive 1-10
seasons, however, Temple remains
the Spotted Owls of the»Big East —
only slightly removed from extinc-
tion.

Last season, Pitt relied on a_ 21-
point Pitt rally to defeat the Owls 53-
52. Critics of Pitt were using words
such as bumbling, backfiring and
bush league to describe the Panthers

\ both before and after last’s years

Homecoming. contest.

This season, people are using two
slightly more encouraging words:
“bowl berth.”

The key to this Saturday’s game

does not rest on how well the.

Panthers and Owls statistically match

~ up against each anothervon offense,

defense or special teams.

Rather, this contest will rest upon
how the Panthers can manage their
emotions. The Temple game is sand-
wiched in between two of Pitt’s most
meaningful games of the season --
the Thursday night Miami win and
next Saturday’s game against Notre
Dame.

This Saturday’s game is a mea-
suring stick for both teams. Pitt is
looking to build upon its legitimate
status in the Big East —— a feat that
will be reached only if the Panthers
soundly defeat the outmatched Owls.

Walt Harris will face one of his
greatest challenges in attempting to
get his troops focused on Temple.

Fresh off holding the then-21st-
ranked Hurricanes to 17 points, the
Pittsburgh Panthers’ coaching staff has
decided to make four crucial changes to
the defense.

The line gets the largest overhaul.
Freshman Jeff McCurley is replacing
redshiit senior Jason Sobleski at nose
tackle, and redshirt junior Marlin Young
is replacing redshirt freshman Calvin
Robinson at right end. .

In the backﬁeld, redshirt senior
John Jenkins regains his free-safety
position from converted quarterback
D.J. Dinkins for the Temple game.
Jenkins injured his knee at the end of
summer camp, and saw some action as a
backup against Houston and  9

The fourth change is also due to

injury. Sophomore Hank Poteat will’

start for the injured Chuck Brown at
comerback.

All of the changes were made based
on the performance this week and last
week in practice, according to
Defensive Backs Coach Bill McGovern.

Dinkins, here breaking up a pass in the season opener, lost his spot to Jenkins.

“We got some competition, and

guys who play better will start,”
McGovern stated.

In other words, the new starters 9

Panthers blanked in weekend road losses

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Panthers’ women’s
soccer team started this weekend’s road
trip without a win in Big East conference
play.

After games at Villanova and
Rutgers, the Lady Panthers were still
without a win. They were also without
any goals, shut out by a combined 10-0
mark in the two contests versus their con-
ference rivals. _

Friday, the Panthers went to
Philadelphia to play Villanova, where,
like many of the previous games this sea-
son, Pittsburgh was outshot. This time,
the margin was even larger than normal
—— Villanova blasted 21 shots as opposed
to Pitt’s ﬁve.

“We were out of sync and out of
rhythm,” said Pitt Head Coach Roland
Sturk of his offense. -

Pittsburgh goal keeper Ilene Ravich
made eight saves, but she did give up six
goals.

The ﬁrst Lady Wildcat shot to sneak
past the goalie happened just nine min-
utes into the game. After another goal
nine minutes later, the Panther defense
stepped up — stopping the bleeding and
hanging tough until halftime. .

After the half, things seemed to fall
apart for the visiting Panthers. Villanova
scored at the 61:20 mark —- 1:20 into the
second period. Just ﬁve minutes later, the
Villanova team netted its fourth goal of
the game. The 4-0 lead was already fairly
insurmountable, but to add insult to
injury, the Wﬂdcats scored yet again in a
quick two minutes.

The Panthers seemed to have weath-
ered the stonn, but they were mistaken.
At 79:29, Villanova netted its ﬁnal goal
on a penalty kick. This left the ﬁnal at 6-
0. ‘

“It was difﬁcult to put together a
decent attack,” Sturk said. “We are just
taking the brunt of_ the other team’s
attac .”

Keeley Tobler led the Lady Panthers
with two shots on goal. Vanessa Madison

and Lori Kizeszewski also registered
shots for Pittsburgh.

After the embarrassing defeat to
Villanova, the Lady Panthers took their
road show to Rutgers, another tough Big
East opponent. '

Once again, the home team drew first
blood and beat Ravich midway through
ﬂie ﬁrst half. The Scarlet Knights blasted
a shot into the upper right comer of the
net to take a 1-0 lead at 22:09. ’

Pitt held its own through the remain-
der of the ﬁrst half, holding Rutgers’ to
only the one goal. Unfortunately, the
Panthers were outshot 16-1 in the open-
ing period.

“We are playing too tentatively,” said
Sturk, referring to his team’s lack of
shots.

Just four minutes into the second
half, Rutgers struck again. Jen Tobin took
a pass and tapped it into the left comer of
the net. Again, the lead seemed insur-
mountable.

And as was the case in the Villanova

THE PITT NEWS

Wrestling recruiter Payne resigns

Assistant coach cites low pay, past administration as reasons for
departure; other assistants, baseball manager also leave.  

. Brian Knarvish

Staff Writer

The Panther wrestling team has already
started practicing for what will likely be its
most successful season in recent memory (a
pretty tall statement for a team that has ﬁn-
ished in the nation’s top 30 in 12 of the past
14 years). The team returns a host of talent-
ed wrestlers, including seven national qual-
iﬁers and two All-Americans, and is the
preseason favorite to win the Eastern
Wrestling League, arguably the nation’s
toughest wrestling conference.

Unfortunately for the Panthers, they
will undertake the 1997-98 campaign with-
out the full-tirne services of highly regarded
Assistant Coach Dan Payne.

Payne, who turned in his resignation
last month, said he simply could no longer
make ends meet living on the mere pennies
that constituted his assistant coach’s salary.

“It’s a combination of me putting two
years of my life into Pitt wrestling and hav-
ing other organizations [businesses, not
other wrestling programs] recognize the
work I’ve done and offer me positions, but
the university that I was working for did not
even olfer me a raise,” said Payne, who is

currently attempting to ﬁnance his master’s I

of business administration degree here at
Pitt.

Payne is aware that wrestling is not a
revenue- generating sport and did not expect
to make what football or basketball assis-
tant coaches do. However, he believes his
salary was unreasonable.

- “I’m the lowest paid assistant in the
EWL [Pitt is the second-largest school in
the conference],” he explained. “When I
realized that I could wait on tables four days
a week and make more money than I was
coaching, I knew I had to get out,” he
explained.

‘The only person who asked me what
it would have taken for me to stay was
[assistant coach] Eddie Palmer,” Payne
explained. “And it wouldn’t have taken

I much.”

Athletics Director Steve Pederson is
aware of the problem of his assistant coach-
es’ miniscule salaries, but because of the
state of the athletics program when he
inherited it, he must ﬁrst turn his football
and basketball programs around so that the
department can actually make money.

At many major universities, the foot-
ball team makes enough money to carry
itself and the entire athletics department.
Pitt’s football team hasn’t broken even the
last few seasons, let alone brought in the
surplus cash necessary to fund all the sports
adequately.

“The salaries of our assistant coaches
are not in the range where we want them,”
Pederson explained. “Our focus is to take
care of all our sports, and we are working

aggressively to raise those salaries. You

don’t want to lose good coaches.”
Payne is not the only Pitt coach to leave
in recent months. Baseball Head Coach

Payne said. “One of “.1 ‘‘He’s a very
thing he has that I think ' intense coach. He

a lot of past administrators and coaches did-
n’t have is a vision. He’s been around suc-
cess, and he won’t settle for anything less.

“I have conﬁdence in Steve and I have
conﬁdence that he will help wrestling in
every way he can. But he has to take care of
football ﬁrst, and I understand that, but
unfortunately I’m not in a position where I
can wait around [for a raise] .”

Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer

reﬂected similar feelings about the situa-
~ tion. ‘

“Steve inherited a multitude of prob-
lerns, and you can’t ﬁx everything in eight
months,” he said. “Obviously, the assistant
wrestling coach’s salary is not his number
one priority, but I’m a Steve Pederson fan.
He has a vision of success for all Pitt athlet-
ics.”

Payne is by no means tuming his back
on Pitt wrestling. He will continue his
involvement with the program as a volun-
teer assistant, purely out of his commitment
to the team members.

“I have an obligation to the guys, “
Payne said. “After you help to build a team,
you really want to be around the year things
are all going to come together. I want to ﬁn-
ish what we started.”

Coach Stottlemyer is grateful for
Payne’s commitment to the program.

“Dan is an outstanding coach, an out-
standing motivator, and an outstanding
recruiter,” he said. “Nobody wants him to
be a part of Pitt wrestling more than I do.”

Recruiting is perhaps where Payne has
made his biggest impact. In his two years at
Pitt, Payne has been largely in charge of the
recruiting, and during that time Pitt has
brought in some of the nation’s most talent-
ed wrestlers. I

makes you pick it up a few notches,” junior

Jake Schaus said. “He’s a technician and a '

great workout partner. You can call on him
24 hours a day, and he’s willing to come up
and work out with you.”

All—Ame1ican grappler John Vtrrthrow
said that Payne is a big reason he reached
that status.

“[Mark] Bodo and I worked out with
Payne a lot. He really helped us and made
us better,” he explained. “He’s probably the
toughest coach I’ve had, and you can’t ask
for more than he gives.”

As a workout partner, Payne helped to

prepare a couple of collegiate All-
Americans, a noteworthy achievement in its

9 own right. But Payne the workout partner
also helped to prepare an Olympian for his

quest for the gold.

“Danny was one of my best workout
partners,” said Kurt Angle, Olympic Gold
Medalist and Payne’s former teammate at
Clarion University. “He always made him-
self available, he always pushed me, and he
always made me focus.

“He’s always been a hard worker and
he has outstanding athletic ability. His
brother is in the NFL and he’s probably only
half the athlete that Danny is.”

Dan’s brother Seth is a rookie defen-
sive tackle for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

While Payne’s presence will be missed,
Pitt is fortunate to have Palmer ready to step
in as the full—time assistant. Palmer was on
the staff as a part—time graduate assistant last
season.

“Eddie is a great coach and he’ll be
able to do everything I did, if not more,”
Payne said. “I wouldn’t have left if I wasn’t
sure that the new assistant would be able to
handle the job.”

easy because it contained all the cru-
cial elements of a big game — a
Homecoming contest on national
television against one of the Big
East’s strongest teams.

Temple is the joke of the Big
East, so this matchup lacks the drama
of other games.

On the other side of the coin, the

_Spotted Owls can delay their extinc-

tion with a victory against the
Panthers and at least temporarily
prove that they belong with the big
boys of the Big East. The win would
be a tremendous boost for Coach Ron
Dickerson’s rebuilding efforts.

So this Saturday’s Pitt—Temple
matchup will have much larger rami-
fications than was expected at the
beginning of the season.

No longer is Pitt—Temp1e the bat-
tle of the Big East basement.

Thank God.

watcher and extinct—animal activist.

defense could disrupt their scheme,
but the coaches do not seem to think
so.

“There will be no difference in
our defense,” said McGovern.

HeadCoach Walt Harris echoed
McGovem’s statements, commenting,
“All of those guys have played before,
and I am not worried at all.”

The main reason for the changes
was all of the competition at practice.
This is good for the team, said Harris,
because it lets the players who are not
starting to get a chance to prove what
they can do. It also pushes the starters
to do a better job.

“I just hope we have better players
after this,” said McGovern. “Our sec-
ond strings have gotten a lot better
over the last two weeks.”

Harris againagreed with his assis-
tant, saying that “competition makes
each guy better. It takes a rare person
to keep his foot on the gas 110 percent
all of the time.” .

D.J. Dinkins, who will now come
off the bench on passing downs, has

had a very turbulent season. At the end
of last year, he thought he would be a
quarterback. Then, Harris told him he
needed him to ﬁll in at safety.

Dinkins spent a lot of time learn-
ing the position and ended up with the
starting job. Now, he has been bumped
back to the bench.

Dinkins has taken all of the moves
in stride.

“When my number is called, I’ll
be ready to go,” Dinkins said.

One of the reasons Dinkins has
taken the changes so well is because
he wants to win.

“We have to have fun and be
loose,” he noted. “We have to play as
a team, and I’ll be happy as long as we
keep winning.”

All of the Panthers’ changes
should not affect their defensive .
scheme at all, according to Hanis.
Come Saturday, they will employ the
same run—defense—oriented schemes
that were used against Miami — but _
this time, to stop Temple’s running
attack.

game, there was more to come. Six min-
utes later, the Knights netted another goal
to make it 3-0. They snuck a cross-ﬁeld
pass behind the defense and popped it into
the net. ‘

Rutgers put an exclamation point on
Pittsburgh’s dismal weekend by scoring a
fourth goal at 79:28.

They dominated the game, outshoot—
ing the Panthers 28-5. For the entire week-
end, Rutgers outshot Pittsburgh 49-10.

Sturk chalks up most of his tearn’s
problems to inexperience. It’is the squad’s
first year in the Big East — a league that
boasted the second— and fourth—rar1ked
teams in the nation at the start of this sea-
son. Naturally, Pitt’s record in non—confer—
ence games is much better than that in-
conference.

“The teams we play are much more
experienced,“ said Sturk.

Pittsburgh does not get a break from
the conference schedule any time soon.
The Lady Panthers remain on the road to
play at Syracuse this Saturday. They
return home on Oct. 8 to play West
Virginia.
