No answer from OSA on rush

By Jim ‘Urban’
Editor-in-Chief

Efforts by Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity to clarify the rules
governing fraternity rush may pay
off, but it might not be for a

while. _ T/|3,e.._..uni.versity’s"'i legal

council is currently reviewing the
rules, Assistant Vice President for
Student Affairs Dennis Donham
reported Friday.

The fraternity, disputing _sever-
al rules, had contacted the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union about
filing a class-action suit against

the university's Office of Student"

Activities in August. The ACLU
responded by writing a letter to

the OSA, requesting that the

office review its rules and possi-
bly clarify them. .

President Reagan's plans to
reduce the education budget will
represent a Pell Grant reduction
from $3.9 billion to $2.7 billion,
affecting 5,000 students who
receive $7 million in Pell Grants
at Pitt. .

About 90 percent of Pell Grant -

recipients at Pitt have family in-

comes of $21,000 or less. Under 1

Reagan's proposed budget, only
students whose family incomes

Marion Damick, spokeswoman
for the ACLU, said Friday that a
Pitt official had telephoned to in-

form her that ’fthey,were looking _
.1-at 1't.‘“i ”" ‘

Donham said the case is being

handled by Richard Jewell-of the A ,

University Legal Council.’-Jewell
was not available for comment
on Friday. " . ‘
”I would imagine they are still
reviewing it,” Donham said-.
According to Damick, there is

not a set time limit for the-univer-A

sity to answer the ACLU’s
inquiry.

”When we do set atime limit,’
we usually give them a week or
10 days to answer,” Damick said.
”That is when we have the inten-

are $15,000 or less-will be eligi-
ble for Pel_l Grants. '

In an overview of financial aid
recipients at Pitt, Dr. Betsy Port-
er, Director of Admissions and
Student Aid, wrote, ~“The [Rea-
gan] Administration’s proposal
for student aid support of [fiscal
year '88] is a contradiction in
public policy when viewed with-
in the context of the recently
reauthorized Higher Education
Act.”

‘ In the overview, Porter cited
the/following characteristics of

with Pitt.” f ; I

The rule the ACLU que_sti.oned
is Article V, Section C of‘”PoIi-

_cies Governing Fraternity Rush.”

It concerns rush schedules. In the
new rules adopted last winter, Ar-
ticle V, Section C states ”A|l rush
activities must be devoid of sex-
ually exploitive components, i.e.,

"exotic dancers, pornographic...

films and the like.” -

Phi'Gamma Delta was banned
from having mud wrestling on its
fall rush schedule. V

The ACLU bases its defense on
the claim that Article V, Section
C is a violation of the First
Amendment, Damick said.

Donham was not sure when an
official statement from the univer-
sity could be expected.

Dole seeks to determine success of nomination

WASHINGTON — The White
House said that President Reagan
stands by his nomination of
Robert M. Gates to head the CIA,
even though Senate Republican
leaders suggest the nomination
may be in trouble.

Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole of Kansas was canvassing
other senators over the weekend,
trying to determine if there was
enough "support for Gates or
whether the nomination should
be pulled back from the
Democratic-controlled Senate.

Dole said Friday he plans to
talk next week with Howard Bak-
er, the newly appointed White
House chief of staff and former
Senate majority leader, about the
Gates nomination.

’’If there's not enough support
for Gates, it's likely they'll with-
draw and put in somebody who
can win,” said one congression-
al source, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ‘

Gates, currently the CIA’s
deputy ‘director, was nominated
to replace William Casey, who
resigned following surgery for
brain cancer.

Roberts will fast to

reach $8 million goal

TULSA, Okla. — Television
evangelist Oral Roberts says he
plans to begin fasting on March
22 and to continue until he
reaches a fund—raising goal ”or
God calls _me home.”

Roberts has said that God told
him he will die unless he raises
$8 million for medical missions
by the end of March. In a letter
mailed to supporters last week,
Roberts said he was $1.5 million
short of the goal.

”So with God's leading on
March 22, I am going to make the
most important trip I have ever
made up into the Prayer Tower
[at Oral Roberts University]/’
Roberts said.

’’I am going to be in and out of
the Prayer Tower praying and
fasting until victory comes or God
calls me home,” he said.

They said the accident oc-

The bus was carrying people

Skiers suffer injuries
at Pyrenees ski resort

TARBES, France — A damaged
chairlift pitched dozens of skiers
onto rocks and snow far below
Sunday, killing five of them and
badly injuring 25 at the Pyrenees
resort of Luz-Ardiden, officials
said.

Sixty other skiers on the lift
suffered lesser injuries.

Some victims reportedly fell from
heights of up to 130 feet.

The accident occurred about
4:30 p.m., but the cause was not
clear. Local news media gave
conflicting reports, saying the lift
cable snapped, that it jumped off
a pulley or that a support pylon
may have collapsed.

The lift could carry 200 skiers
at a time.

Reagan's popularity has reached

Americans giving him a negative

a Newsweek poll. _

The poll indicated that 40 per-

Coalition of schools to be voice of area students

By Gary Toney

For The Pitt News

A student unified Coalition of
Pittsburgh Schools is an idea be-
ing resurrected by Pitt Student
Government President Phil
Moyer.

Although there is a Pennsylva-
nia Coalition of Student Govern-
which includes

the state, the proposed Coalition
of Pittsburgh Schools would be
unique in that it would include
seven area colleges and univer-
sities, all private with the
exception of the University of
P i tts b u r g h .

-The Coalition would include’

Carnegie Mellon University,
Duquesne University, Point Park
College, Robert Morris
College, Chatham College and
Carlow College. '

Previously, there was a Pitts-
burgh Inner City Student
Government Association which
last met during the 1984-
85 school year.

According to Chatham College
Student Government President

Flotation

By Matthew Thornton
Contributing Editor

Take off your clothes, climb ~
‘ into a tank of body—temperature

water and relax while floating in
total darkness. It's called sensory
deprivation, an idea new to the
Pittsburgh area. L

Last month, the Flotation Sta-
tion opened in the lriquois Build-

ing on Forbes Avenue and, .

according to Sister Michelle Teff,
the director of the station, the
concept is catching on.

”We have a special interest in
the university'community,” Teff
said. ”Students can use the serv-
ice to relax before exams, to
study with learning tapes or to
just unwind.”

The center has a number of
tapes the floater can play during
the one-hour session, ranging
from ‘nature music to smoking
cessation. '

Originally from the Mid-West,

 

  
     
  
   
 

Cathy Saegel, ”The goal was to ‘
have more interaction between‘

the schools and institutions that
were involved.” Seagel said she
is very receptive to continuing the
concept ofa united group of col-
leges and universitites°and ex-
pressed optimism for the
Coalition.

Moyer said, ”I found that I was
calling schools, «I was asking them
about their activities fees, and I
was asking them a lot of other
questions about their school and
I decided, ‘why not have an in-
formal group that passes informa-
tion on, say once a semester that
just gets together?’ ”

Denise Overfield, Student
Government President at Carlow
College, said, ”Pittsburgh is
unique because we have all these
schools concentrated in one area.
I think the Coalition would be a
good way for communication
betrween the colleges and
universities. I'm hoping it will be
a forum for idea sharing, a way
of communicating fresh ideas.”

Although Overfield said the
meetings should be ”open, un-
structured and free-flowing,” she

Station is

\ Teff became interested in the idea
of floatation through her brother,
a doctor in Wisconsin.

”|’ve been interested for a good
many years,” she said. ’’I float on
a regular basis.” -

The concept of sensory depri-
vation was developed by John C.
Lilly in the 1950s. Since then, the

I research has been centered

around relaxation and stress
management.

It is relaxation and stress reduc-
tion that the Flotation Station tries
to promote.

”In all our lives, there is a huge
amount of stress,” Teff said. ”By
floating, a person can reduce the
stress in their lives and be better
equipped for everyday work. We
have a lot of people that use the
service before work in the morn-
ing, and they find themselves
much better equipped to deal
with life as a result.”

Other users of floatation tanks '

are the_Denver Broncos football

66

A student leader
without an idea is just
another person with an
office.

g — Phil Moyer
said she sees the need for some
structure with regular meetings
and different agendas.

One issue Overfield said
should be addressed is student
financial aid, both state and fed-
eral. ’’I think a strong voice ask-
ing for why would be effective.
Educating students in financial
cuts and asking state and federal
why cuts are being made.”

Moyer said he has had some
difficulty organizing the Coali-
tion. ”It’s very difficult, first of all,
to even get in touch with the

_ presidents, let alone set up a time

to meet withthem,” he said. ”|t’s
going to be a long process to for-
mulate this thing only because
schedules are so different and
time is very limited as far as ex-
tra time that we have. We're busy

the latest

team, airline pilots and business
executives.

In a general sense, the theory
behind ”floating” is that a person
can focus much more clearly on
their minds when environmental
stimuli are removed. The body-
temperature water and the light-
less atmosphere contribute to
give the floater .a feeling of
weightlessness and peace. _

_Peter Suedfeld, a professor in
the psycology department at the
University of British Columbia,
found that flotation therapy in-
duces increased theta. wave
(thought to be associated with
deep relaxation) activity and has
had good results in the elimina-
tion of smoking, obesity, phobias
and other addictive behavior.

This reporter has tried the tank,
spent a full hour there and found
that the relaxation resulting from
the session has continued for

. more than a week.

”It helps to reduce chronic

governing our own student bod-
ies and to try and govern another
body or formulate another body
difficult.”

The idea has already been
unanimously approved at Robert
Morris College. Judy Connolly,
Robert Morris College Student
Government President said,
”Everyone in our government is
enthusiastic to the idea being a
good one and I think it's a good
idea. It will bring unity to the col-
lege students of the Pittsburgh

is even more

area.”

Connolly agreed that student
financial aid would definitely be
a topic to approach with the Coa-
constitution
or framework outlining the Coa-

lition and ‘a

lition should be developed.

”We were considering a con-

stitution,” Moyer said. ” I think
the constitution would not so

much be a strict governing docu-

ment as it is with our Student
Government Board or with other
student government boards. I
think it would be more or less just
explaining what should be done
with the Coalition and what can

be done with the Coalition than _

thing in relaxation

pain, back ache and hyperten-
sion,”_Teff said. ”Nothing can
even come close to the ex-
perience.”

In some of the research, sub-
jects have reported feelings of eu-
phoria, mystical experiences and
hallucinations.

Suedfeld’s research determined -

that a process which reduces-the
amount of external stimulation
can allow a person to relax ‘and
rest more easily. Stress is gener-
ally caused or complicated by ex-
cess stimulation from . the
environment, and by reducing
that stimulation, the flotation
helps to alleviate those disorders.
There is no universal ex-
perience for a person who floats,
but there are some general im-
Tpressions reported‘ by many. In
the beginning of the first ex-
perience, there is often a brief
period of anxiety, not unlike that
felt in any new environment.
After the acclimatization peri-

what mustbe done or how it
should be run.”

Mike Sosso, President of Du-
quesne University's Student
Government Association agreed
with other college, government
presidents about the usefulness of
the Coalition.

”I think the Coalition is a good
idea and I would like to suggest
the meetings be hosted by each
college and university on a rota-
tional basis,” he said. I would like
to have a central school handle
the correspondence and commu-
nication. The primary purpose
can be information sharing and
by necessity, the scope of the

Coalition should be broad."-

Sosso pointed out the possibil-
ity of all Coalition colleges shar-
ing a leadership workshop.
”Potentially, the Coalition could

work on the issues of financial aid '

and I would not preclude the dis-
cussion of crime concerning the

' institutions,” he said.

Sosso suggested an exchange
of student newspapers between
all seven colleges and universi-
ties. ”I’d like to see a meeting be-

0d, the floater feels relaxed and
and ”at peace.” In" this phase,
there is a general sense of time-
less well-being, and the problems
of the day fade away.» After the
euphoria, there is_a ”,stimulus-
action” hunger that develops,
when‘ the floater begins to search
for ‘something in the 7 en-

vironment. « .. .

Research in the field ofthe en‘;-5
hanced learning potential of-floa-’
tation is still being pursued, with
indications that use of the flota-
tion tanks, with the tapes, in-
creases the subjects ability ‘to

remember material. Sharp rises in -- 

the abstract reasoning abilities-of " 6 4;’-

the perticipants have been noted. '3 ,
In most cases, there was no «  ~

feeling of confinement reported,
but rather a sense of open space,
not at all unpleasant. .-

Best of all, it's an escape that
is not physically destructive, and

Let's elect some
competent people

Asanyone will agree, a govenment has a serious problem
when it has to have an outside judicial body try to decide where
its foreign policy decisions are made.

The Tower Commission's report criticized the Reagan ad-
ministration of maintaining a casual attitude toward the lran-
Contra affair, saying that the presidentwas not completely aware
of the decisions that were being made. The inference is that
Reagan may not have total control of most of the policy deci-
sions made in the-upper levels of the government.

We, as a nation, have a long history of scrambling to find

our reputation than having a public scandal with the president's
inability to govern at its ‘heart. '

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 2, I987

Just say — I don't know

I saw something the other day
in a newspaper in which readers
were asked to pick their favorite
woman. The Woman of the Year
or the Woman of the Century, or
something like that.

At first, I was in a quandry.
Who isthe best of the brightest?

5 There are women in every field
that deserve respect, and I had to

pick just one. Who would it be?

Christy Brinkley? Nah, too
many chauvinistic overtones.

Michelle Maddoff? She's not
afraid. to say what she thinks;
yeah, she might be a good
choice. Except that she's nothing
more than a soggy cracker in the
stew of life. I needed someone
more universally important.

, “Vaina” White? You've got to
love a woman that can become
a celebrity by being part of a life-
size crossword puzzle. Not only
that, I have some basic moral
reservations about game show
cretins.

Marion K. Finkelhor? She's a
judge who likes to take on all the
toughest cases, except that she
likes to nap during the proceed-
ings. “Huh.. uh, what was that,

‘ I must have, uh, missed some-

thing. Wait, is this the Perry Ma-
son show?” Forget it, I was just
blowing off some steam.

Florence Henderson? The all-
American lady. I only have one
reservation — she does like that
Wesson oil. What's she doing
with it?

Mary Lou Retton? A couple of
Olympic medals and a few bat-
tery commercials past puberty,

‘ and she is one of the hottest

    

 _  v. I

women in the country. Except for
one little thing. Who really cares
whether she's energized?

How about Margaret Hatchet,
the British Prime Mistake? She's
hot, she's powerful, she's got
something good going. She also
has a propensityfor killing Latin
Americans for stealing sheep. No,
not Marge.

I know, Nancy Reagan. What
a wonderful lady. Aside from her
self-appointed duty of saving
America's youth from the evils of
drugs, heathenism, hedonism
and other assorted sordidness,
she likes to run the‘country. You
have to admire ambition.

Since Reagan took office so
many moons ago, good old
Nance has been walking around
with her nose in the govern-
ment’s armpit. _

When she thought Ron should
take a break, he did. She doesn't
like Don Regan, and loo_kie here
— Don's gone. Wheeeee. I love

this country.

I may be losing my memory -
its fashionable —— but I don't
remember seeing Nancy's name
on the polls last election. So, I
guess I'm asking what the f—
she’s doing dabbling in politics.

Sheis the president's wife, and
she may have a better grasp of the
finer points of politics than her
aging, cute, happy-go-lucky hus-
band, but again, I don't remem-
ber anything in my political
science classes about the politi-

cal duties and powers of the:

president's spouse.

Where does it say that we have
to have tag—team politics in this
country? If we wanted Ronnie in
office, and I imagine there are a
lot of people kicking themselves

about that, then he should be the

president — not his wife, not his
mistress, not Oliver North. If he
can't do the job alone, then get
him the hell out.

I have nothing against women.
I like women. Some of my best
friends are women. My mother is

a woman. If Reagan had a hus— ,

band, and he'saw fit to act as
Nancy's acting, I’d be writing this
about him. It's the blatent abuse
of power that bothers me.

Nancy has his ear, obviously,
and a good deal of the rest of
him. That's her right; she married
him. Everyone needssome sort of
compensation.

What she shouldn't have,

though, is his job. If she wants to‘

be president, let her run for office.

That's the way the system works.
So, in conclusion — Just Say

No to Nancy. ‘

Mona Lisa is just moaning  

I know of a man who has spent
10 years searching for a pair of
lips. And he says he'll spend
another 10 if that's what it takes.

No, this man isn’t looking for
a “good time,” nor is he missing
his own set of lips and waiting for
a donor. He wants to find one
pair of lips, and one pair only. He
won't be satisfied until he finds
them. And I hope he dies trying.

He is a plasma physicist and

I laser expert at_the University of

California in San Diego, and he
wants to find the real lips of
Mona Lisa.

A researcher at Bell Labs has al-
ready said Mona is a self-portrait

" of Leonardo DaVinci. Lenardo

must have been a real cute babe.
When will scientists stop trying
to reduce the only thing — well,
the only other thing — that exists
for pure pleasure to an analytical
phantasmagoria of logic devoid
of emotion and enigma?
Would you believe that a phy-
sician has even proposed poor

Mona suffered from Bell's palsy,’

a condition which would possi-
bly explain her uninterpretable
facial expression?

Uninterpretable? Yes, I think
the Mona Lisa is uninterpretable.
Uninterpretable by any machine
or scientist, that is.

Ifl had enough money, I'd buy
all the art in the world and build
a gallery of my own. The only
people I would allow to view the
art would be those who_want to
do it for sheer enjoyment.

I can't imagine anyone who
would_make it their life mission
to completely destroy a genera-
tion's perception of one of the

most —- if not the most —- interest-
ing pieces of art in the world. '

What could possibly be gained
from this? What? ‘We've been
thrown the possibility (I don't buy
it, though) that Mona is a self-
portrait of DaVinci. So what?
Another question for a future e_di-

"tion of “Trivial Pursuit?”

The phrase trivial pusuit is all
too apt for this situation.

Are these scientists trying to
gain notoriety for this? Will there
be more books published about

» this? _
The day it was supposedly dis-

covered that Mona was really
DaVinci, it was one of the biggest
stories in the news. It also hap-
pened to be a very depressing
day for me, and I'm sure there are
others who were distraught over
the news, too.

This is a case of technological
abuse. We have been given great
instruments that can be used for

curing diseases and helping-to,

 

 

solve world hunger, and now it
seems like some of us are using
these tools for toys.

Maybe some people find all of
these revelations interesting. I
won't ignore that. But as far as I
can see, nothing can possibly be
gained by knowing that Mona
used to have a necklace that
eventually faded and that there
used to be a mountain range in
the background.

In this day and age, we have all
but forgotten our aesthetic sense.
We are definitely more artistical-
ly aware, but I think we have
been conditioned to feel obligat-
ed to analyze everything. Noth-
ing can simply be enjoyed.

Although its is completely im-
possible for some scientists and
analysts to insist on doing things

' like this, I just wish they'd keep

it to themselves.

What will be next  the Eiffel
Tower was originally built by im-
ported Aborigine slaves from a re-
mote island off the coast of Nice?
Michaelangelo’s painting on the
Cistene Chapel represents an an-
cient satanic ritual characteristic
of dwarves from New Guinea?
Andy Warhol's soup can was
really painted and exhibited on a
dare?

I'm waiting for some fame-
starved scientist to figure out how
Buckwheat actually got his hair to

look that way, and that Don King A

is actually a descendant of
Buckwheat.

Let's leave Mona alone.

Jukebox hall of

fame — revisited

Speaking of jukeboxes (as

we were in a recent column),
the most amazing jukebox sto-
ry in the country comes out of

In that city, Helen Reutzel,
59, owns and operates what is

ing “live” jukebox service in
the world.
It works like this: In a tavern

or a‘ restaurant, a customer will
drop a quarter in the jukebox.
When the coin is inserted, a
"ding” is heard in the studio
of Telephone Music Service —— ' ,
Reutze|’s company. Telephone Music Service is connected to
the tavern by telephone lines. I .

The customer in the tavern picks up a telephone on top of
the jukebox. Miles away, in her studio, Reutzel picks up a tel-
phone, too. The customer tells her what record he wants to hear.
She puts the record on a turntable in her studio. It is piped over
the telephone lines and is heard in the tavern.

"My father, Bill Purse, started the Telephone Music Service
in 1929," Reutzel said. "At one time, our clients included 120

v bars and restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. After my father died-, -

I took over the company. Now ‘I have only eight taverns and
restaurants who still use the service. But I'm trying to keep it
going.” i ' i

The studio of Telephone Music Service is open between 2
p.m. and 2:30 a.m. daily. Each tavern has a loose—leaf binder
with a listing of approximately 2,000 songs that can be played.
But customers are urged to request any song that they may
remember from any year. Reutzel probably has it.

”During the evening, the calls come in non-stop,” Reutzel
said. As she was explaining this to me, there was the sound
of a "ding.” Then another “ding.” She excused herself and
picked up the telephone. I

It was a patron of atavern called Karoline’s, who had dropped
two quarters into the jukebox and wanted to hear “The Marine -
Hymn” and “The Hawaiian War Chant.” Reutzel found the

records, put the first one on and then returned to our conver- ,

sation.
. “Services like ours were very common all over the United-
States prior to World _War II,” she said. ”Today people are used
to automatic jukeboxes. Most of the time, when someone goes
into one of the eight taverns where we have our jukeboxes, they ‘
have to be instructed how to use the jukebox. They can't be-
lieve that they're supposed to talk to someone and request their
song.” ‘ .

Although it would seem impossible to keep track of all
100,000 records, Reutzel has them all numbered and can find

. them in rapid fashion. “Take ‘Cowgirl in the Sand.’ by.Neil

Young, forexample,” she said. “That’s No. LPY8. ’My Girl’ by
the Temptations is No. D338. ‘El Paso’ by Marty Robbins is No.
BG22I. If I don't know where a record is by heart, I'll just look
it up in my card file.” _ A
When there are dull moments in the studio — when patrons

in the eight taverns aren't calling —- Reutzel manages to keep :

herself busy. _
“I run the sweeper, or I clean the records, or I file new songs,”

she said.
Just then there was another “ding.”

Reutzel said into the telephone, ”Joe Walsh? He has a new ‘

record?_What’s it called?” _

She listened to the answer coming from the customer in the
tavern. ' _

"The new song is called ’Confessions’?” she said. “I don't
have that. How about ‘Rocky Mountain Way’? That's by Joe
Walsh, too.” ll '

Apparently that was a satisfactory compromise, for Reutzel
removed ‘Rocky Mountain Way’ from the rack and piped it over
to the tavern.‘ .

“People like my service because it's personalized,” Reutzel
said. "Anyone can drop a coin into an automatic jukebox, but
how many people can actually talk to someone far away and
order any record they want? One" woman, for example, said
she wanted to hear ‘Summertime.’ I told her that we had 15
records called ‘Summertime.’ So she started singing it to me.
I told her that the song she wanted was called ‘In the Summer-
time.’ She said, ‘Oh, yeah!‘That’s it!’ She said that it used to

. be her father's favorite song.

“Now tell me could you do that with a regular jukebox?”‘

Southern blacks call for boycott“

By David Beard

Associated Press Writer

CANTON, Miss. —— Blacks in
several Mississippi_towns have re-
vived a tactic of the 1960s by
boycotting schools and white-
owned businesses in what they
call a last resort to achieve politi-
cal goals.

’’I think this is something we
felt we had to do,” said Rev.
Michael Cathey, ,a leader of a
black parents group that wants a
black assistant superintendent of
schools in Senatobia. Blacks set
up an economic boycott because
”nobody was listening. And we
will be out until they do.”

In Canton,..where Martin Luther
King Jr. once organized against

. white supremacy, blacks post-

poned an economic boycott set
for Friday when the town's mayor
promised to put a black on the
school board.

”We have done this before,”
said Jimmie Lee Van Buren, one
of three Canton residents" who
filed a federal suit last Monday to
force the school board selection
in a district where 97 percent of
its 3,500 pupils are black.

”As far back as the 19605, Can-

ton has been dealing with boy-
cotts,” Van Burensaid.

But the success of a 1986 eco-
nomic boycott in lndianola and
a feeling that no other route for
change exists have inspired the
recent surge of activity in at least
five Mississippi towns, protesters
said.

Organizers of the 37-day Indi-
anola boycott said they received

‘calls from black groups through-

out the state and from Tennessee
and Alabama. The boycott end-
ed last May after businessmen
agreed to pay a recently appoint-

ed white school superintendent L

$90,000 to leave and replaced
him with a black superintendent.

But both sides in lndianola,
birthplace of blues guitarist B.B.
King and the White. Citizens’

"Council, see the closed business-

es and residual bitterness“ that
Hngen

”A boycott must be the last
resort. We had exhausted all
channels that we thought were
available to us. After we exhaust-
ed those, we had tomove to a
more abrasive approach,” said
Willie Spurlock, spokesman of a
parents’ group that sponsored the
lndianola boycott.

Tommy McWilliams, a white

lawyer who worked with
Spurlock to settle the protest, ac-
knowledged that Spurlock and
others may have had no other
choice. ' ‘ ”

”But it hurt the blacks as much
as the whites," McWilliams said.
”Now, industrial prospects look
at you with a jaundiced eye. But
instead of letting it drain us, we
are trying to build on it.”

McWilliams and Spurlock
point to solutions that the boycott
has fostered, including a bi-racial
committee, special bi-racial
Christmas services and a jump in
community involvement in the
school system, where 93 percent
of the pupils are black.

Both whites and blacks praised
new superintendent Robert Mer-
ritt, a longtime principal and
20-year employee of the school
system.

In Senatobia, Cathey said black
students, who make up about 34
percent of the l,650—pupil sys-

tem, are not being encouraged or _

given role models. He said the
school board reneged. on a
promise to hire a black assistant
superintendent, but superinten-
dent Mike Waldrop said the
school board could notfind a
qualified candidate.

Liberal arts majors value rising

By Deena Dib

_For The Pitt News

After four years or more of hard
work, you finally receive a
degree. It's now time to take
everything you've learned and
sell yourself to a potential em-

H ployer;

Engineers apply to big industri-
al companies, nurses apply to
hospitals, but where ‘does a liber-
al arts major go for a job?

A dgree in liberal arts is same-

A thing that many people consider

to be a waste of a major.
However, employers and stu-
dents are realizing the value of a
well—rounded education.

”Most concepts of liberal ‘arts
are that you get a broad back-

4 ground in a variety of things,”

said Fred Koloc, director of advis-
ing for CA5.

-A liberal arts student has the
opportunity to pick and choose
any courses that interest him or
her. Koloc also said that once —a
student has taken several courses
he can ”then pick something he's
interested in and take some extra
work in it.”

Liberal arts offers a student the

chance to have several areas of
concentration. For example, a

student can achieve fluency in a ’
A foreign language, acquire impres-

sive writing skills and gain an un-
derstanding of ecomonic policies
all within one degree. _

If this student would have chos-
en French, writing or economics
as a major, he would have had to
complete several extra terms in
order to gain the same education
as the liberal arts student.

According to Koloc, liberal arts

A students are able to combine «a

wide variety of courses to
produce a unique academic

background. This is an asset to a ‘

graduate who has just entered the
job market. There are new jobs

someone with a well—rounded
background can adapt to these
changes "much easier than
someone with one specific skill.

But Koloc said that there are
some disadvantages to this
degree also. Because a lot of peo-
ple don't understand the liberal
arts concept, the liberal arts major
often finds that he must repeated-
ly explain his degree and qualifi-
cations.

Liberal arts majors are often left
without specific labels. This can
handicap a graduate when he
enters the job market. At the
same time, this can also be an ad-
vantage. The student without a
specific title can apply for any po-
sition that interests him. Koloc
said there are three types of liber-
al arts students. The ideal student
is one who is ”very excited about
learning all things.” This student
has faith in himself and believes
he can do anything he sets his
mind to.

The second kind of liberal arts
student doesn't want to be
categorized. This student wants
to keep his options open and be
able to have a wide choice of
jobs when he graduates.

The third type of liberal arts stu-
dent is one who discovers later
that he doesn’t like his present
course of study. and ”wants to
graduate as close to on time as
possible.” These students can opt
for a liberal studies degree.

Liberal studies is a degree
unique to Pitt. According to the

‘degree description issued by

CAS, ’’It is not really a major, but
the definition of an education.”

The university requires 120
credits and all the general educa-
tion requirements. Of the total
credits at least 30 must be at the
100 level. This degree allows the
student maximum flexibility in
planning their undergraduate

. studies.
_ constan_tly being created, and '

According to Koloc, there are

several "ways for a liberal arts
graduate to go. One choice is to
continue his education by choos-
ing a graduate program. There are

'many graduate programs availa-

ble to students. However, the stu-
dent is often led to believe he can
only apply to theones in which
he has had previous experience.
This is not necessarily true.

There are certain programs that
do require special undergraduate
work, but'a liberal arts student
can usually apply for almost any
post-baccalaureate work that in-
terests him.

A second option is to enter the
work force immediately after
graduation. Because of the liber-
al arts student's” academic back-
ground, there are many job
possibilities.

”There is nothing a liberal arts
student isn't qualified for,” said
Robert Hopkins, director. of
Placement Services at the univer-

sity. However, it can take longer .

to find a job.

’’It takes longer for the student
to get started because, of all their
choices,” said Hopkins. But on
the more positive side, ”They are
less affected than professionals
during recessions,” said Hopkins.

Hopkins said this is due to the

fact that they can adapt much eas-
ier to changes in job demand.
V A 1987' survey in Changing
Times revealed that 30 percent of
employers have a need for gradu-
ates with liberal arts degrees. This
shows that more employers are
putting emphasis on well-
rounded education.

The survey also gave some
potential jobs for liberal arts
graduates. They ranged from
junior accountant with a financial
service to product management
for a greeting card firm. The aver-
agestarting salary is in the area
of $16,000 to $19,000. V

said.

Upon returning from a student
government conference in Texas
last week, Moyer was inspired to

‘ carry the idea of a coalition
further. ‘

”l found that the most valuable
time I spent with other universi-
ties was when we had these
things called roundtables, where
students sat at a roundtable and
just talkd about their university,”
he said. ”We had one subject to
discuss and I_ came back with a
notebook full of ideas after find-

ing out information from the-

universities.” —
Moyer said he hopes to involve
_ more students in the generating
of ideas. .
A ”A student leader without an

 -idea‘is just another person with
«fan, office,” he said.
.:_ Moyer said he hopes to address,

potential problems with the coa-
ylition before they surface.

ties  It's like a group of students
from different unioversities sitting
down and just talking about
something. I don't see that as be-
ing a problem.

Moyer said he would like to
see one representative from each
school, preferably the student
government presidents. He said
he fears a larger group would bog
down discussions.

The proposed coalition would -

meet only in the fall and winter
terms, according to Moyer. He
said the first meeting will proba-
bly be this fall.

’’In the beginning of the fall A
a would be a perfect time,” he said.

”Students will be coming back,
people are getting geared up to
do things again, people will be-

we have s_ome motivated people

or not it's going to become con-

dents of Carnegie Mellon Univer-

NAACP reviews election policy

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The ,

head of the National Associa-

tion for the Advancement of '

Colored People said he's col-
lecting data on city council
elections by district, an issue
that may be considered at the
group's convention in July.

The NAACP currently does
not have a policy on district
elections, although a number
of local chapters have sued,
seeking district rather than at-
large polling, according to
NAACP President Benjamin
Hooks.

Hooks told the Pennsylvania
Black Conference on Higher
Education on Friday that the

NAACP board has asked him '

to prepare position papers on
both sides of the issue in an-
ticipation of a national policy
decision. He declined to ex-
press a preference.

In the meantime, the nation-
al organization will not ques-
tion the Pittsburgh branch’s
decision to support at-large
elections, according.to Hooks.

His stand sparked con-
troversy last month, with some
voting rights activists saying a
Change to district voting
would ensure black represen-
tation on the currently all-
white Pittsburgh City Council.

Thirty-six percent of Pitts-

burgh-’s 425,000 residents are
black. ' ‘

”The Pittsburgh branch is
free under our guidelines to
take the position they feel is
best for the community,”
Hooks told The Pittsburgh
Press. ”We are not going to
second-guess the Pittsburgh
chapter.”

Pittsburgh NAACP President
Harvey Adams said the chap-
ter will continueto support at-
large elections, a position that
would change if a national
policy is adopted favoring vot-
ing by district.

”We yield to-the wisdom of
our national,” he said.

Pitt Greeks leery of raids

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Following the recent alcohol
raids at fraternity houses at
Penn State University, Pitt
Greeks are taking precautions
to prevent their houses from
being raided. .

’’I think that it's a possibili-
ty [a raid]. But I think that our
members are doing a lot to
prevent things like that from
happening,” said Dan
Skowran, vice president for.ex-
ternal affairs of the |nterfrater-
nity Council.

”All of the chapters that I
know of use guest lists. The
ones [at Penn State] that had
guest lists weren't raided by

the Liquor Control Board,”
said Skowran.

Philip Ashe, president of Pi
Kappa Phi Fraternity, has de-
veloped some policies that he
thinks will safeguard his
house.

”We have implemented a
ticket policy. lfa girl shows up
with a high school jacket on,
she is turned away. Also, no
one is allowed to leave our
parties and come back. We
monitor our parties for noise
and stray people,” said Ashe.

”We have a guest list of no
more than 30 guys,” said Phil
Finelli, the president of Delta
Tau Delta. ”The list is made
before the party starts. Any girl

can come in as long as she has
college identification.”

Mike Carozza, the president
of the Delta Sigma Fraternity,
said he thinks that raids could
happen here and the only way
to stop them is through

' prevention. ”We keep our par-

ties to guest lists. There's hard-
ly any strangers at our parties,”
said Carozza.

Bridget Guernsey, Pitt's
Greek adviser, said that her
office has not receieved any

complaints this term. Accord— .

ing to Guernsey, this is due to
the fact that the fraternities are
concentrating more on spon-
soring events than on beer
parties.

Village Voice film critic
says gay roles mislead
public’s interpretation

By Richard E. Pozzuto

Contributing Editor

Pitt's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
hosted an evening with Vito Rus-
so, noted film critic of The Village
Voice and Film Comment maga-
zine. Russo is also the author of
The Celluloid Closet: Homosex-
uality in the Movies.

In accordance with his book, as
well as his personal obsession
with understanding society’s per-

vasive hatred and intolerance of
gay people, Russo’s presentation
consisted of film—clips and discus-
sion designed to exemplify the
”celluloid” reflection of society’s

motivation and actualization of ‘

negative attitudes ‘toward homo-
sexuality.

The presentation chronologi-
cally revealed the recurrent
modes of homosexual expression
in the movies from the early 20th
century to the present. Russo
showed clips from the 1919 Ger-
man film Different than
Others (the first film about
homosexuality ever made) and
went on to show how decade af-
ter decade films ..defined,
chastised, ignored, prohibited
and misinterpreted homosex-
uality. ' _

Russo said that a prominent
theme figuring in the movie in-
dustry's handling .of homosexual-
ity was society’s desire to see
masculinity and femininity por-
trayed in a certain way.

Russo implied that there has
been a gradual erosion of toler-
ance for effeminacy in the mo-
vies, to the point where
”masculine” females such as
Greta Garbo and Mae West be-
came intriguing, exotic, and
desireable.

According to Russo, the con-
cept of lesbianism was treated

')

with much less prohibition than _

that of male vhomoeroticism.
There were both covert and ob-
vious references to lesbianism in
vampire movies such as Daugh-
ter of Dracula and ”women in
prison” movies like Cage.
”Many famous movies had gay
themes in them, but were later
changed,” said Russo. Russo cit-

5 ed several examples where the

homoerotic nature of characters
created by Tennessee Williams,
and even trivially ”good guy/ga|”
characters was completely
reversed or ignored.

In Dr. Strangelove, the presi-
dent of the United States, played
by Peter Sellers, was orignally
supposed to be a homosexual,
and in Bonnie and Clyde, any
references to Clyde Barrow’s bi-
sexuality were removed.

”They made the decision that
the public could take a psycho,
but not a ’sexua|ly-confused’ psy-
cho,” said Russo.

Georgetown gets top
seed in tournament  

By John Enright

Sports Editor ‘

' NEW YORK — Despite Satur-

day's loss to St. John's, Pitt com-
pleted the regular season
schedule with an impressive 23-6
record and a share of first—place

with Georgetown and Syracuse. ,

All three teams finishedwith 12-4
league records. ' -
Georgetown will be seeded
first in this weekend's Big East
tournamentat Madison Square
Garden in New York ..on the
strength of its two wins against
the Panthers this year. The Hoyas
will play the winner of Thursday
night's preliminary game be-
tween Connecticut and Boston
College on Friday at 7 p.m.

. Meanwhile, the Panthers are
seeded second, ahead of Syra-
cuse because of Pitt's 2-0 record
against the Orangemen this year.

Pitt will play seventh seed Se-

ton Hall on Friday afternoon at 1
p.m. _

Friday’s other’ first round
matchups are: Syracuse (3rd
seed) vs. Villanova'(6) at 3 p.m.
and St. John's (4) vs. Providence
(5) at 9 p.m. .

Providence plays Villanova at

home tonight. If the Friars can_

win it would give them the fourth

A-seed ahead of St. John's, but the

two teams would still meet in the
quarterfinals. The switch would
only determine who dresses as
the home team.

Pitt's game against Seton Hall
should be an interesting match-
up. The Panthers will be trying to
get by the quarterfinal game for
the first time ever, having lost in
the first round their first four tries
in the league tournament. Mean-

NEW YORK — Rod Brookin,
Pitt's freshman forward, had just
scored the last two of his team-
high 22 points, tying Saturday
night's game with St. John's at 74
with 25 seconds left.

The Redmen came down court
and called a timeout to set up a
last shot. Everyone in the crowd
of over 6,000 at Alumni Hall
knew who would take that shot
—- senior Mark Jackson, St. John's
All—America point guard.

How wrong they were. .

With Panther guard Mike
Goodson denying"Jackson the
ball, the Redmen had to look for
other options. ‘

It would have only seemed fit-
ting for Jackson, the career assist
leader at St. John's, to be the hero
in this, his last home game. But
it wasn't to be. - 1

Fellow senior classmate Willie
Glass stole the show. Glass, who
finished the game with 18 points,
got the ball in the paint and hit
nothingbut cord on .a jumper
over Pitt center Charles Smith's
out—strected arm, giving the Red-
men a two-point win. .

”You can't think in that situa-
tion,’.’ said Glass. ”You have to

McRae was Pitt's only

mates will again part company.

fired on a halfcourt shot.
But St. John's John Hempel

’ traveled with Goodson’s airball,

leaving the Panthers with one se-
cond left. Gore inbounded under
the hoop to Brookin, who missed
on a three—point shot from 22
feet. -*
Goodson was supposed to call
timeout at halfcourt, but he took
the errant shot instead. ”[Evans]
told me what he wanted, but it's

‘a little hard to look up at the

clock,” said Goodson.

”Obviously, we never should
have taken that shot,” added
Evans.

Foul shootingwas, once again,
Pitt's downfall, and no one was
more at fault than Smith. The
6-10’ center was fouled all night
by the St. John's big men, but he
hit only six of 12 free throws and
finished with 12 points.

- preliminary game. Since Pitt's in-

ception into the league, a prelimi-
nary game was necessary for the
nine-team conference and Seton
Hall has always played in that
game until this year.

The Panthers have defeated Se-
ton Hall twice this year, but
center Charles Smith knows the
team can't take anyone for grant-
ed. ”With those three teams at
the bottom of the conference
there's not a big difference, but
in the tournament you never
know what will happen,” said
Smith. .

Panther point guard Mike
Goodson was disappointed that
Pitt lost to St. John's, costing them
sole possession of the regular sea-

co Baldi both fouled out but did
an effective job of frustrating
Smith into a three-for—1 2 shooting
night. ’’It worked well for them,”
said Evans of St. John's strategy.
”They took 14, 15 fouls against
[Smith], and he missed a lot of
foul shots, plus his shooting was
off.”

Smith wasn't alone in his inep-
titude from the line. Pitt made ‘
only seven of 15 second-half foul
shots and missed its last six at-
tempts. Forward Jerome Lane and
guard Curtis Aiken each missed
two shots from the line with Pitt
up by two points and under six
minutes remaining.

’’If we don't shoot fouls better,
we're not going to go far,” said
Evans. -

St. John's trailed early in the
game 21-11 but battled back to
take thellead at the one-minute
mark 35-31. The game was tied
at halftime 35-35.

Pitt's Demetreus Gore scored

son title, but he thinks the tour-
nament could spell redepemtion
for the Panthers. ”We can make
it up by winning the tourna-
ment,” he said.

Pitt coach Paul Evans sees the
tournament much the same as he
viewed the regular season. ”Just
like the season, I think five teams
have a shot. St. John's playing in
the Garden has a good chance.”

The Redmen have already
played seven games in the
Garden this year, winning five. St.
John's senior forward Willie
Glass is confident about his team.
”Come Big East time we'll be
ready,” he’ said. 1 4

ond half points, giving Pitt a
45-37 lead. But, as they always
seem to do, the Redmen came
back.

”St. John's is a team like Geor-
getown.‘We were up on them,
and they came back,” said
Goodson.

The win was the 100th in the
four years Jackson and Glass have
played at St. John's, but this one
may have stood out above the

rest. ”The win means a great/den‘ .

to me. It's like the last£‘.“'/ ‘-

”| just didn't want_‘,

with 22 points.

For Pitt, though, it was a  

pointing loss in a regular seas;

While some players, Goodson  5'

in particular, were upset about
not winning the title, Evans

doesn't think it will make a differ-3

ence. ’’If we were the fourth or
fifth seed and had to play a tough
team then it would be different,”
he said. '

The Panthers have one thing to
be pleased about. If they make it
past Seton Hall, they will have to
play the winner of Providence-St.
John's — and not Georgetown —
in the semifinals.

The Hoyas have won seven
straight games and are one of the
hottest teams in the country right
now.

Evans said he thinks Geor- ’

getown and Syracuse are the
favorites.

Obviously, Alisa Spector, top
scorer on the Pitt women's gym-

petitor.

The ice, however, is more of a
post-practice ritual than any par-
ticular rehabilitation. ”l had a
really bad injury back in Decem-
ber, and it really set me back,”
Spector said. ”After 11 years in
gymnastics, it's taken its toll on
my body,” she said.

But it was a healthy Spector
who faced Eastern Michigan and

firsts in the vault and floor exer-
cises and capturing the all—around

”Sal|y Sheerer played an ex-
ceptional first half. She kept us
right in there,” said Bruce.

Sheerer, a 6-0 junior forward
from Fox Chapel, once again led
the Lady Panthers in both scoring
(23 points) and rebounding (8).

Senior Jane Plake and sopho-
more Amy Holman also con-
tributed a great deal to Pitt's first
half effort, adding eight points

now.”

Although nearing the end of
her senior year, Spector is always
looking for ways to improve her
performance — both physically
and mentally.

Spector’s routine on the vault
currently consists of a hand
spring with a front flip over the
horse. ”Hopefully, next meet I'll
be able to pike the front flip at the
end. It's nice in yrur senior year
to throw in som .= new things,”
she said. ‘

part of her mental routine. ’’I go

almost every night before I go to

preparation. ’’I start going

Seton Hall to build an 11 point

pleased with team, but

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 2, I987

expects to soon see even better

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
traveled to Philiadelphia Saturday
afternoon for a tri—team meet with
Temple and Southern Con-
necticut.

The Panthers (7-2) finished sec-
ond with a season high score of
257.15, with Temple and
Southern Connecticut scoring
268.75 and 249.55, respectively.

"I’m pleased with our perfor-
mances,” said head coach Frank
D’Amico. "It’s always difficult
competing at Temple, but we had
a good meet. I don't think we've
hit our peak yet. If we can
eliminate some of the mistakes,
we could improve four or five
points."

‘how to do,” she added.

Spector said she uses a slightly
different approach for each event.
"For the vault and the floor, I go
all out and attack it. When it
comes to the beam, I try to relax
and almost get into a catatonic
state. It helps to even me out,"
she explained.

Spector said she considers
mental toughness her biggest as-
set during a meet. Due to an in-
jury, she missed nearly a month
and a half of the season. After
only four days preparation, she
competed in a meet. "There was
no way I was physically ready, so
I had to rely on my mental abili-
ty,” Spector said.

Pitt head coach Debbie Yah-

' ‘man discussed one of her biggest

assets during a meet — Alisa
Spector — and what she means
to the team. "She’s a role model
from the aspect of belivnggﬂthe

- - team's top scorer,” Yohman said.

"Not all gymnasts make it
through four years of school and
still keep getting better. Alisa is
still . getting better,” Yohman
added.

Spector downplays her being a

~ role model but doesn't take it for

granted. "It’s a challenge that I
like," she said. "It helps me be-

al, scoring 53.85. Temple's Joe
Rowlette finished second and
Southern Connecticut's Hector
Salazar finished third. Panthers
Pat Pollaci and Jorge Sanchez
rounded out the top five. "We
had a real good team effort. We
went out and did what we
could,” said Sanchez.

Strong performances on the
floor exercise came from Sanchez

. who scored a 9.4 and Pollaci

who scored a 9.25. On the
parallel bars Gonzalez and San-
chez each scored a 9.05 with
Steve Powanda directly behind
with a 9.0.

The top_ Panthers on the pom-
mel horse were Gonzalez with a
9.15 and Mike Mealie with a

also the top two Panthers on the

might be looking over, and it also
helps the team, which I like,"
Spector added.

Spector’s normal workout
doesn't vary much from week to
week. On any given day, work
on three events is the norm, along
with special attention to problem
areas — conditioning and weight-
lifting.

"We’re really fortunate to have
a good working relationsip with
the men, too," Spector said.
"They have little tricks and tech-
niques they can teach us, and we
help them on the floor exercises

. because they're not as graceful,”

she quipped.

By the end of a three-hour prac-
tice, Spector is often tired. "You
come home at night, and you're
and mentally
drained,” she said. "The way I've
done so well in school is to be
very organized and stay up late
until I get it done," she explained.

tional Players Championships.

Navratilova, playing her first
tournament since losing the final
of the Australian Open to Hana
Mandlikova in January, pounced
on the 10th-seeded Sabatini from
the start and was never seriously
threatened.

Lendl, the men's defending
champion, came from behind for
the second straight match and
beat Austria's Thomas Muster
3-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-2. Connors, the
No. 6 seed, advanced to the
fourth round with a 6—3,.6-3, 6-1
victory over Australia's Darren
Cahill.

Lendl, the men's top seed, took
control of his match midway
through the second set and
finished the demolition of Muster
in two hours, 38 minutes.

Lendl fell behind 0-2 in the sec-
ond set, but won the next four
games to turn the match around.
He broke the Austrian’s serve in

 

high bar, while Dan Tarosky
finished first for Pitt on the rings.

Pitt's top vaulters were Gonza-

lez, Pollaci and Marty Comini.
"This team has the potential to
be the best team I've ever had,"
said D’Amico. "This is one of the
strongest freshman classes I've
had. Gonzalez is having a fine
year. Pollaci is one of the most
consistent people we have in the

gym, and he keeps improving._

And Brock Freehling is doing
very good despite some of the'ad-
versities he's had to face.

"Our guys showed a lot of
spirit," he continued. '’I have a
good feeling about this year even
though we still have a couple of
tough meets ahead of us.”

The Panthers’ next meet is Sun-
day at the Great Lakes Champi-
onships at Kent State.

 

ance would be a trip to the na-
tional championships.

Since Pitt won't qualify as a
team, Spector hopes to compete
as one of the top ten aI|—arounders
whose team didn't qualify. Spec-
tor’s fate, however, may not be in
her own hands. "The only
problem is they score so much
higher in the West," she ex-
plained. -

As a freshman, Spector reached
nationals. Now as a senior, she
feels completely ready for nation-
als. ’’In four years, I've become
much more consistent. Mentally,
my attitude has changed. I was a
lot more uptight as a freshman,"
sheadded.

And what does the future hold
for Alisa Spector? A

"I have a job offer from the
University of Massachusetts to be
their assistant coach while I go to
graduate school," Spector said.
”After I get my MBA, I want to get
into the real world."

Alisa Spector not only has her
goals in order but also has both
feet on the ground. ''I'm very for-
tunate. |'ve always had good
coaching. I've had a lot of sup-
port from my family, helping me

Swimmers prepare for Eastern Seaboardsi

By Beth Froelich

Sta ff Writer

The 10-0 Pitt'men’s swimming

team will travel to West Point,-

New York to compete in the
Eastern Seaboard Championships
March 5-7. . '

The Panthers will be looking to
better their sixth-place finish in
last year's championships.

”We will be competing against
a lot of teams with a tremendous
amount of depth,” said Pitt men's
swimming coach Fred Lewis.
”Our team has more depth this
year than ‘we had last year. I'm
looking for us to finish fourth, but
if we have a really great meet, we
could possibly finish third.”

This is Pitt's second year com-
peting in the prestigious and
competitive Eastern Seaboard
Championships. The top_compe-
tition for the Panthers will include
Harvard, Princeton, Army and

Navy. Harvard swept the cham-

pionships last year and is likely
to do so again this year.
Coach Lewis feels that if Pitt is

to successfully move up in the.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 2,1987

ranks, it will be dependent on the
ability of all Panther swimmers to
give their lifetime best perfor-
mances.

Coach Lewis is looking for im-
pressive performances from
juniorjim Emore, among others.

After qualifying for the‘ NCAA
Championships at the Big East
Championships in the 100-yard

butterfly, Emore will be trying to

improve his time and possibly
qualify for the NCAA Champion-
ships in the IM and the 100-yard
backstroke.

Two of Pitt's relay teams have
an excellent chance of achieving
NCAA qualifying times at the
Eastern Seaboard Champi-
onships.

The 400-yard freestyle team,
consisting of freshman Tim
Adams, sophomore Scott Jeffries,
junior Charles Lersh and senior
co—captain Tom Shaulinski, are
close to making the NCAA cut.

”We can make the NCAA
qualifying time if we all swim our
best times,” said Shaulinski. ”The
key is we all have "to click at the
same time.

McWilliams trying to  
overcome his injuries

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —— When
the Pittsburgh Pirates were hurt-
ing for pitching, La/rry McWil-
liams was just plain’ hurting.

If any oneplayer’s career has
paralleled the Pirates’ plunge to
the National League East base-
ment, it has been that of McWil-
liams, the team's most successful
pitcher only two years ago._

McWilliams, 15-8, was named g
- to the Sporting News All-‘National

League team as a left-handed
starting pitcher in 1983 thenwas
12-11 with a 2.93 ERA onthe
pitching-rich but victory-poor
1984 Pirates. _

The last two seasons have been
a pain not only to the Piratesand
their fans but to McWil|iams.
Shoulder injuries that resulted in
decreased velocity, fewer victo-
ries and his removal from the
starting rotation hurt McWilliams
both on and off the field.

’’It hurts your pride, and you've
got to have pride to be a profes-
sional‘athlete,” McWil|iams, 33,
said. ”You don't like not being
able to do your best.” .

His 1986 numbers —— a 3-1
record, a 5.15 ERA and only 15
starts in 49 appearances — wer-
en't what the Pirates had in mind
when they signed him to a four-
year contract in 1985. Including
incentive clauses, he was paid
about $1 million last season or
about $333,000 a victory.

Opposing scouts have said a
strained shoulder McWi|liams
suffered in 1985 has greatly af-
fected his velocity and his ability
to retire hitters. McWi|liams dis-
agrees.

’’I think my problems were
more a case of mechanics than a
velocity loss,” he said. ’’It was
more of a case of me being in a
rut and not doing anything to get
out of it. I didn't work as hard as
I should  I needed to throw

harder and with more. control,

but I waited for ithto come in the

. back door.”

Pirates Manager Jim Leyland

‘ has McWilliam_s -slated__for_'s. '

middle-innings relief and for spot
late-inning situations against
difficult left-handed batters.

But on a young pitching staff
where none of the five projected
starters had a winning record last
season, McWil|iams knows what
a valuable asset he could be if he
could regain’ hisformer effec-
tiveness.

”We haven't written him off,”
said Pirates General Manager Syd
Thrift. ”He’s worked harder on
off-season conditioning than he
did before.”

’’I don't think I'm very far off
from being the pitcher I was be-
fore,” McWilliams said. “That's
why. I worked har .”

Despite his 10-20 record the
past two seasons, McWi|liams
has a 68-67 career record and is
43-44 since the Pirates obtained
him‘in a 1982 trade with the At-

lanta Braves for pitcher Pascual '

Perez. . _

’’I think it's going to be a help
that [pitching coach] Ray Miller
is here because he has worked
with a lot of veteran pitchers. I
know he'll give. me some help
and will be a good sounding
board for me,” McWilliams said.

”The Eastern Seaboard Cham-

that we have been training for all

Eastern Seaboard. The speed of

BRADENTON, Fla. —— Syd
Thrift, attempting to rebuild a los-
ing team with young talent, be-
lieves’ the Pittsburgh Pirates will
show enough improvement this
season to_justify his rehiring as
general manager.

A former scout who had been
out of organized baseball for 10
years, Thrift signed a two-year
contract 15 months ago after a
Pittsburgh-based -consortium pur-

' chased the club.

His first season on the job was
less than memorable, as the
Pirates, 64-98, had the major
leagues’ worst record for the sec-
ond year in a row.

"I know our fans are eager for

a winner, and I am too,” Thrift’

said Saturday at the team's Pirate
City train_ing camp. _"But it takes

time when you're doing it the
way we're doing it, and we're do-
ing it the right way.

"When I look at where we are
right now compared to where we
were a year ago, I can see clear-
ly we have made substantial
progress. Many times it's difficult
to measure progress with wins
and losses, but I think we will be
able to soon.”

How quickly young players
such as first baseman Sid Bream,
outfielder Barry Bonds and pitch-
ers Bob Kipper and Mike Bielecki
reach their major league poten-
tial will determine if the Pirates’
return to contender status will be
a short one, Thrift said.

"I don't want this club to get-

better for me but for the city of
Pittsburgh,” said Thrift, whose
contract will be up for renewal af-
ter this season. "The fans are pa-

in any other city, they want a
winner.

"And I'm just like the fans. I ask
myself, ’When are we going to
start winning? When are we go-
ing to win more than we
lose?’ I'd like us to get to .500 be-
cause then you're a third—place
team, and there's a chance for
you to go all the way."

The key to the 1987 Pirates will
be how quickly their youthful
pitchers develop, he said. The
1988 Pirates, Thrift predicted,_
will begin to show signs of ma-
turity. And the 1989 Pirates 

”That’s the year,” Thrift said. ”I
think that is the key year, 1989.
I'm basing that on the,players that
are here —— the Kippers, Bieleckis,
the Bondses and the [minor
league] players that aren't here

yet, like [second baseman] Jose

Lind, [outfielder] Jeff Cook and
[pitcher] Mike Walker. '

”We look at each player and
rate him on a scale of 1 to 4, with
I being a major league superstar

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 2, 1987

and 4 being mediocre. We also
rate the ‘players on other clubs, so
we know where they're at. You
can't predict anything for certain

because you are dealing with hu- I

man beings, but to me, 1989 -
that’s the year.”

The Pirates’ decline from
perennial contenders to cellar
dwellers has been attributed to

free agents busts such as Steve.

Kemp, Sixto Lezcano and Amos
Otis, who cost millions -to sign
and produced little in return.

The Pirates, under the control
of their cost—conscious new own-
ers, have shyed away from the
free agent market the last two
winters. And Thrift has been criti-
cized by other generalmanagers
for being overly stubborn and
unyielding in trade talks.

But Thrift hasn't ruled out sign-
ing a free agent or two or pulling
off a major trade in the future if
he is convinced the player he
wants can make a major contri-
bution.

Pirates should be improved’, says Thrift

’'I want players who want to
play in Pittsburgh,” Thrift said.
”Above anything else, the play-
er has to want to play for us.
Money isn't everything  there
were plenty of guys here making
big money, but they weren't hap-
py playingin Pittsburgh.

”Now you see players saying
they want to play in San Diego or
Los Angeles or Philadelphia, but
they don't say they want to play
in Pittsburgh. When they want to
play in Pittsburgh is when we
might be interested.

”You have to be sure the

_ chemistry is right because signing

the wrong guy can upset the
balance on a team. When you
want to sign a free agent is when
you're in third -place trying to
reach the top, not when you're at
the bottom trying to reach third
place, he said.

”I’d just like us to get to third
place because then we can wor-
ry about winning instead of wor-
rying about losing."
