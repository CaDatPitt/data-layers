Set as Deadline
For Owl Sales

The Owl Oﬁice announces that
an extension has been granted
until December 10 for students to
purchase the 1946 Owl, and to
make appointments for pictures.

“This is an opportunity for
those seniors and underclassmen
who have not yet ordered the
yearbook to do so,” said La Rue
Moss, Eiditor. “There will posi-
tively be no further extension
after that date.”

Gimbel photo studios will be
open daily until 5:30 p. m. to take
pictures according to appoint-
ment. ‘These appointments should
b-e made earlyiat the Owl oﬂice
to avoid long waits at the studio.

In order to maintain uniformity,
all undergraduate women must
wear sweaters and pearls and un-
dergraduate men long ties, and
jackets. The senior women's pic-
tures will be taken in black vel-
vet drape and the senior men’s
inytuxedos. The clothing for the
seniors will be provided at the
studio.

Dorothy Anthony, circulation
manager, urges any student, sen-
ior or undergraduate who has not
ordered his Owl to take advan-
tage of this extension. “Prompt-
ness,” she said. “means that you
will have your Owl at the ear-
liest possible date.”

also represents the world ’s most patent example of many peo-
ple of numerous origins l.ivjn_g7ttogelzhcr in harmony.

Judging from the cnnumci;'able stories wliicli have come out
of the War, most people like A.l'll€l‘lCt1llS. They like their talk,
their contagious grin, and their way of life. It goes Without
saying that our millions of genial “GI. ambassadors” have
found a place in the hearts and minds of people throughout the-

an example and giving aid to needy nations-—aid which will
enable them to I*ega,ln their feet by strong pulls on their own
bootstraps. i

 We must not think of ourselves as a sort of super race,
however, for there are still many dark blotches on our escutcheon
such as racial intolerzince and graft-ridden labor unions whose
corrupt leaders advocate the economically unsound policy of
more pay for less work. Still, we have made a start and it is a
good one. Truly, the world looks to us both for the shape and

Organization plans of the veter-

ans at Pitt may be clariﬁed by the
meeting attended ‘by

interested
men in the Dean’s office yester-
day. Seems to me that with ,2}

thousand ‘vets in school here such
an organization could be quite

‘ beneﬁcial both to the University

and to the veterans.

First of all, we have a horrible

Service Fund, but from the World

We’re sorry, but gosh—in these
days of bureaucracy it takes a
minor genius to keep the alpha-
bet—organizations straight.

You've got to admit, though,
that last week’s column was a
pretty good “plug” for WSSF,
which DIOES start its drive on the
tenth of December. All workers for
WSSF take note, the training ses-
sions start tolmorrow. The Y oﬁices
have the information about where,
what time, and how many, so “con-
sult them for further detailst. M

Todtay’s the day that Dean Bid-
dle’s news-letter to the Service-
men goes out, and ‘anybody who

office on the eighth boor. We’ll see
you upithere.

having in obtaining surplus ma-

read a feature article on that

Seems auto dealers are obtaining

to do than vets. We don’t give a
tinker’s-‘ah, “tink” about buying
up G91. equipment but interested

Patton Does Researbh

At Psychiatric Institute

If you are looking for Dr. Robert A. Patton, instructor in psy-
chology, you will probably ﬁnd him on the seventeenth ﬂoor of the
Western State Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, busily putting albin

rats into a curious looking box.
It all started like this. In 1938,

.' 3

Dr. Maier, University of Michigan,

won the American Association‘ for the Advancement of Science Award
for describing severe convu_lsive seizures in the rat. Dr. Maier found

that, when rats were subjected to¢

an emotional conﬂict by being
forced to respond in a learning
situation which was too difficult
for them to master, and if then a
high pitched blast of air was in-
troduced to force a reaction, some
rats showed convulsive symptoms.
Dr. Maier assumed that those
symptoms were due to the prob-
lem, but he failed to take into con-
sideration the sound of the air
blast. ~

Dr. Patton became interested in
that problem. He didn't think that
these convulsions were caused by
the. difficulty of the problem, but
rather that they were a patholog-
ical response. to the sound, stimula-
tion. After many months of re-
search, Dr. Patton found that:

(1) The conv,u1,s_1,ons were caused,
by the sound, not by the
shpck. ‘
The convulsions were. based
on a dietary deﬁciency. ‘
A, Vitamin B-6 or a mag-.
nesium deﬁciency combined;
with. sound could elicit the
fists-
Were made severe, the ani-
mals showed spontaneous;
seizures without demonstra-
bile, sound stimulation of any
kind.

This is where that curious look-
ing box comes in. Dr. Patton

<2).
(3)

built a large square sound-proof‘

box ut_ilizi_ng._ a resonated buzzer in
order to, have a standard sound-,
test situation. He subjected large.
groups of albino rats to a dietary
deﬁciency, thus sensitizing them to.

the" effect of sound and: then Put ,

the rats individually into the box,

thereby causing them‘to have a {-

convulsive seizure. The seizure
shows the usual sequence of in-
creased activity or circular run-
ning; followed by an epileptiform
convulsion and then stupor. '

Dr. Patton then tried to reverse
the process in order to see if the
rats, once sensitized to sound,
could be cured. He found that in
rats who had a magnesium deﬁ-
ciency, the damage was reversible,
while in those rats who had a B-6
deﬁciency, it was not. Dr. Pat-
ton, at this time, is continuing his
egperimentations in order’ to ﬁnd
a;-"more satisfactory answer.

tﬁink that these experiments are
rngrely scientiﬁc dilly-dallying, Dr.
Patton has a deﬁnite object in
nigind: to use controlled nutritional

déﬁciency to produce seizures in -

normal animals and then by re-
v_e_'rsing the process trying to cure
them. These experiments have
illustrated a new experimental ap-

proach to convulsive states and to '

 study of certain dietary deﬁ-
ciencies. Although Dr. Patton is
reluctant to make a statement as
to the connection of nutritional
deﬁciency and convulsive states in
human beings, there may, never-
theless, be a chance that someday.
such a connection may be found.

These experiments have been a
research project in the department
of Research in the Natural Sci-
ences. This department works on
the fundamental concept that sci-
ence can be more greatly advanced
by pooling the knowledge of the
various departments of natural
sciences. Thus the problem just’
described could not _have prog-
ressed without the integration of
tools developed in psychologr and
biochemistry.

Dr. Patton who worked on this
experiment in collaboration with
Dr. H. ‘W. Karn of the department
of-, psychology and Dr. C. G. King
and Dr. Longenecker of the de- I
partment of chemistry, earned his
master of arts and doctor of philo-
sophy degrees at the University

lowshios from the Buhl Founda-

For this experiment, Dr. Patton
utilized the research facilities v:'of
the University and. those of the
Western State Psychiatric Instittite
and Clinic. He has recently been
appointed research assistant in
neuropathology at the Western
State Psychiatric Institute‘ and

After ﬁve months overseas, six
weeks of which were spent in a
Rumanian prisoner of war camp,
First Lieutenant Ed Lee of the
army air force returned: this fall
to Pitt and the college career that
war interrupted two years and
seven months ago.

In February, 1943, a biology
major and member of the air corps
reserve since the previous July, Ed
had barely a semester’s work to
complete for graduation when the
army -air -corps called him to ac-
tice duty. .

By May 1, 1944, his intensive
training was over and! Ed was a
commissioned ﬂight navigator, but
the job had just begun. ‘May 22,
he landed in Italy and was as-

signed to the 15th air force, 301st

bomber g1‘0'uD- 'I‘-hen, June 11, the
ﬁrst mission—-to Vienna. '1‘-here
followed seventeen more missions
in such rapid success-ion that with-
in two months of landing overseas
Ed was a seasoned rveteran.
Finally, the nineteenth mission,

ed to go down. At 11:07 in the
morning Lee stood at the side ‘of
‘the falling bomber l-ooking at his
Watch, ready! to jump.

‘Moments later, he lay in a corn-
ﬁeld, unhurt, but surrounded by
belligerent peasants .-armed with-
vpitchforks, scythes, and clubs, all
shouting one word, -apparently the
Rumanian for surrender. “Being
a very brave man,” says Ed, “I
surrendered.” _

“But,” Ed continues, “the use
tives were not un-friendly. When
they found I was unarmed, we got
along all right. Later, they turned
me over to Rumanian army troops
in a nearby. village. The troops
were friendly, too, but a little em-
barrassed when they went to jail
us and -couldn’t ‘ﬁnd the key to the
cell. We pitched in -and helped
them look for it and found it, just
where you’d expect to find a key
hidden—under a rug!

“Imprisonment there wasn’t too
bad». Peasants brought us each a
piece of bread and a tomato. In-
cidentally, all our conversations
up to this :time had been carried
on in French with an eleven year
old boy. It was lucky I knew som
French. H

see some of the efmcts 0-f our
bombings. I don’t think there was
an undamaged houm in Ploesti.
The people there looked on us as
criminals. We were almost mob-
bed when we arrived at Ploesti
station.”

, The -prisoners didIn’tt remain long
in P1-oesti. ‘T-‘he followding day they
were moved to Bucharest and bil-
leted in an old schoollliouse, where
Ed remained for the duration of

his imprisonment.

Except for an occasii-onal inspec-
tion by German arny oﬂicers, the
prisoners’ -contacts were entirely
with Rumanians, whoawere mostly
pleasant. Conditions at the camp,
however, were anythiing but pleas-
For breakfast there was

wormy, and jam. 'I‘lh:e other two
meals consisted of brown bread

= very few, if any, stutﬁmnts other than veterans can qualify for ad-
' ¢mission.

Applicants must be at
least 19 and no more than 26 years
of age and must be able to meet
the prescribed physical standards.
“Most students who are physically
ﬁt and 19 years of age are already
in the armed -forces,” Major Wills
said. “Therefore it is anticipated
that only veterans will register
for the advanced course.”

Additional qualiﬁcations for ad-
mission include a minimum AGCT
(I.Q. TEST) score of 110 and a
stipulation that the applicant
must require at least two academic
years to complete all require-
ments for graduation. Graduate
students must require a like pe-
riod to complete all work for an
advanced degree.

The object of the course is to
produce college trained Junior
Reserve Officers to meet the needs
of the Army during the post—war
period an-d to presewe and expand
the Reserve Officers Training

Corps in anticipation of post--war‘

Reserve Officer requirements.

The war department agrees to
pay the students «commutation of
subsistence at a daily rate equiv-
alent to the garrison ration, which
is at the present time 66 cents
per day, or about $50 "a semester.
This would be independent of
whatever beneﬁts: the student
might also receive under the edu-
cation provisions of the GI Bill of
Rights. The student, for his part,
agrees to accept a commission of

Youngest Broadcaster Handles
Local Classical Program

Among the new students at the
University this fall is Michael
Marlow, a full time ‘announcer for
station _WW:SW in Pittsburgh.
Only 18 years old, Michael has
the distinction of being the
youngest radio announcer handl-
ing a major sy.mphony broadcast.

Intensely interest-ed in classical
and semi-classical music, Michael
writes the commentaries for both
the “Golden Hour of the Classics”
heard each night of the week, and
the Pittsburgh Symphony con-
certs -broadcasts "from Syria
Mosque. In addition tothese musi-
cal program s, he announces
“Headlines an-d Highlights,” a 15
minute news summary broadcast
ﬁve nights each week.

J

Mike -decided, while still in high
school, that he would be an an-
nouncer. He first attracted atten-
tion by writing a script for a high
school paper of the air. At the

age of 14, he began -broadcasting
local high school sports attrac-
tions over station WHK in Cleve-
land. Mike announced for station
WCLE and WJ W for a short time,

and deciding that a smaller sta-‘-‘

tion would provide more oppor-
tunity for advancement, sent a
recording of his voice to WWSLW
in Pittsburgh. He started as full-
time announcer in June, 1944.

Michael had the honor of rep-‘ ,0

But the worst condition of all,
Ed relates, was the nightly RAF
raids. “They were terriﬁc. You
never knew where the next bomb
was going to land.”

But the British were helpful,
too. Through the nightly BBC
newscasts and a radio which h-ad
been smuggled- in by the prisoners

able to keep in contact with the
outside world. Since the radio had
to be played low, one man was
chosen each night to listen and

the building. M

Rumanians gained control and the
Germans were driven out of
Bucharest, but not before they
had poisoned the 'city’s water sup-.

Meanwhile, the prisoners were
awaiting Allied help. Aid was not
long in coming in. On September
1, giant B-17's of the 15th air

largest evacuation up to that time.

For all his experiences, Ed is
not bitter. There were many times
during the war when his future
was mi-ghtly uncertain, when Pitt-

 announced last week that the track team is to be revived this winter.
This will be the ﬁrst time since the season of 1942 that the Panther

of the recent discharge ofthe track coach, Carl Olson, from the Navy.

New Plan
For Sports

For the first time in a number

rority athletics has again been
brought up by ‘Pitt women. Du_r-
ing the years of the national emer-
gency the only sport in which
sororities ‘participated! together
was bowling. Now, however»,
Women’s Athletic association is
planning to put on a full sched-

nities. « '

This program is now under dis-9 '

cussion between members of

The approval of the Council must
be obtained before such a pro-
gram can be offered. I
rl\/Ieanwhile, W.A.A. is asking for
the full support of all sorority
women. Many colleges throughout
the United States- have had much
success with this type of sports;
W.A.A. thinks that Pitt, too, can
put over a well-rounded schedule.

frat athletics to begin after the

I Hagan- Schedules S15 Games

For 1945-46 Hoop Season

By Lowell Lubic

As the curtain falls on college football, the great American sport of basketball begins to peek its head.

over the sports horizon.

In the brightly lighted gym under Pitt Stadium, Dr. Car1son’s “Cuties” have been practicing tire-
lessly for the past mon'th—-brushing up on their offense and defense. They have developed from a slight-
ly shabby aggregation into a well oiled machine which will fare well against all opposition this season.
For these boys know last year’s mistakes and they are taking precautions to make sure that they will not

happen again.

This year’s Pitt’s schedule shows
three new additions since last sea-

Bai.nbridge.. NTC is an entirely
new opponent. Judging from last
year’s record the Navyrnen should
really ‘give Pitt a tussel. The ﬁf-

cult and the boys will really have
to keep in tip top shape it they
intend to turn out a fine record.

Sports Editor

The 1945 football season has ended and a happy ending it was for
Pitt fans. Jimmy Joe 'Robinson’s 84 yard run provided the margin of
victory and the first Panther touchdown since Notre Dame. As far as
showing any offensive power the Panthers have shown some but it
fades out in the shadow of the goal¢ '

posts. That was proven again on
Saturday when Pitt had gotten to
the State 15 late in the second
quarter and Wertman was stopped
in trying for one yard.

What caused this lack of offen-
sive power? The four star reason
is -lack of experienced quarter-
backing. In professional football,
Sid Luckman, Chicago Bear quar-
terback was a ‘mediocre signal
caller as a freshman. In his sec-
ond year people stood up and no-
ticed him and this year despite the
Bear's fair season, Luckman is the
standout. Smodic and Wolff are
both freshman quarterbacks and
lack experience. The best way to
learn is by mistakes and the
Panthers made their due share.
Against Penn State Smodic led the
Panthers alone, many wondered
why. The reason——Bil1y Wolff was
sick in bed. Clark Shaughnessy
believed the experience that Jack
received on Saturday afternoon
will make him a real quarterback.
Foothill Balnquet

Now that the grid season is
closed the general opinion around
the university is that our boys de-
serve a banquet. At the present
no plans have been made for such

an affair and I doubt very much if
any one connected with the ath-
letic office even considered such a
banquet. Is that against the West-
ern Conference rules?
Penn State Review

The Panthers won 7 to 0 on
Saturday but no one realized the
condition of the Pitt boys. Let’s
glance over the Panther forward
wa1l——Buck Johnson, tackle, played
approximately six minutes and
had to be removed when his two
bad ankles began acting up. Fran
Mattioli who played in his ﬁnal
college game was injured on the
ﬁrst play but insisted to stick it
ou_t. Fran considered himself very
lucky that his knee held up and
his only comment of the game was,
“I was afraid of that boy, Topsic.”
So were all the Pitt rooters. The
center spot had a substitute in ex-

Marine Clougherty. Clougherty
ﬁlled in Johnny Kosh’s regular
spot very well and even intercept-
ed a Penn State, pass. The'back-
ﬁeld was hit harder than the line.
Quarterback Billy and “Red” Mat-
thews even though he saw a few
minutes of action had both ankles
taped. The Pitt offensive was
hardest when Robinson went out.

Pitt rooters have rejoiced three times this football season, and the past Saturday was one.‘

Jimmy Joe was by no means ’
the only star for Pitt. Two Pitt
linemen also played a whale, of a
game. They are Leo (The Name) A

Skladany, an end, and Francis‘-

Mattioli, a‘ guard. Leo ‘broke’
through constantly and

State’s backs for large losses and"

he made it impossible for the op- ‘
position to round his end. Matti-

for the past three years, and he "

due to injuries, Coach Shaugh-‘

generations will refer to as the
dawn of the Age of Atomic
Power?

Today, -many people are short-
sightedly clucking their tongues
over the awesome destructive
power of the atomic bomb, while
they are simultaneously failing to
grasp or realize the multifold’
«blessings that atomic power will;
eventually bestow. One of the
salient reasons for all this fear-
(ulness and -confusion is that mod-
ern science has gotten so far ahead
of the social, political, and eco-
nomic systems of the world that
it will probably be some time be-
fore the latter are even within
hailing distance.

Mean-while, smug statesmen sit
around conference tables and at-
tempt to control atom power by
means of legislation. It should be
evident to all that trying to im-
prison the atomic age within the
narrow conﬁnes of man-made
laws is comparable to a zoo-keep-
er attempting to tiehis wildest
-elephant to a stake with clothes-
line rope. ‘The power in the atom
will be tamed, but it will come
about through scientiﬁc research
and the work of scientists rather
than through the action of stat-es-
men and politicians. In fact, it is

quite likely that these diplomats
and political leaders will -ﬁnd
themselves unwilling participants
in a quite rapid game of “follow
the leader” as they strive to bring
their thoughts and actions into a
closer harmony with the facts and
phenomena of the new age.

Thus "far, we have only been"
able to split the atoms of two
rare elements, Uranium-235 and

Plutonium. Although, as the
atomic bombs have effectively
demonstrated, the power released

is tremendous and almost deﬁes,

comprehension, this power is

merely a whisper of colossal things‘

to come. Because of its high cost,

as a source of industrial power.
Therefore, all we have now is the
atomic bomb which we must not
use and which certain other coun-
tries are bound to discover for
themselves in the not too distant

continue to advance at their pres-
ent rate, there is every reason
to predict that in a quarter of a
century or less, atomic power will
have replaced the various sources
of power we now employ. Through
this scientiﬁc advancement, the
process of atom-splitting will be

our present means of harness;ing'.
the atom is not of practical value’

future anyway. However, as long‘-
as scientists throughout the world-

 

simpliﬁed and made less expen-
sive (in contrast to the involved
and costly operations‘ at Oak
Ridge, ’I‘_-ennessee and Pasco,
Washington which produced the
ﬁrst A-bombs) so that research
talent will eventually discover
how to tap the energy within
the atoms of more common ma-
terials.

Once this has been achieved,
the major economic reasons for

waging war will have been elimi-
nated. With power so cheap and
plentiful,‘ nations will no longer
have cause to squabble over who
isto have access to coal, oil, and
other present day industrial neces-
sities. Another feature of the
power revolution will be the de-
centralization of industry—— for

"industry no longer will have to

cluster dependently around tra-
ditional sources of power. Fin-
ally, the vast new power will be
harnessed in many new and dif-
ferent ways.

Thus, atomic power bids fair to
-bring about a “golden age” far
above anything this earth has
‘ever known. It will mark a big
step forward in man’s constant
effort to control his environment-
a control which should eventually
become a reality. It may be fan-
tasy to speculate as to whether or

not science will ever unlock the
secret of life itself, but, at least,
it now seems certain that men
living in the Age of Atomic Power
will witness achievements that
their ancestors of two or three
centuries ago coul-d never have
conjured in their wildest fan-
tasies. Therefore if it could be
possible for our scientists of the
future to communicate in some
way with our prcfent day poli-
ticians, statesmen, theologians, so-
ciologists, economists, etc., we
feel certain they iwould say in a
voice similar to the admonishing
tones of an old top-s-ergeant,
l“Keep in step, boys; keep in step!”
