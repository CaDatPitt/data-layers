Faculty Assembly approves Health America

By Scott Emmert
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Faculty Assembly voted unani-
mously to retain Health America as
one of ‘its insurance carriers yesterday.
The vote was 26-0 among assembly
voting members.

The Senate Committee on Benefits
and Welfare Chair, professor Herbert
Chesler, presented the committee’s rec-
ommendation that Pitt keep Health
America as an active carrier for faculty
and staff.

The issue was voted on yesterday
morning in the Benefits and Welfare
Committee with four votes for and one
against with one abstention before the
recommendation was presented to the
Faculty Assembly.

Chesler said many considerations

were factored into the committee’s rec-
ommendation.

“Dollars are the easiest tosdeal with,”
Chesler said. He said dropping Health
America from the university’s cover-

Assembly

age would save the university and its

«employees about $5 million, but added

that the savings to individuals would
amount to only approximately $150
dollars over three years.

“How much weight do you attach to
the savings?” he asked.

“Twenty—seven percent of faculty and

Faculty

staff participate in Health America,”
Chesler said, indicating another con-
cern for keeping that carrier. “Keeping

Health America shows support for '

those people.” ’

Also playing a role in the Benefits
and Welfare Committee’s recommenda-
tion were the surveys and petition cir-
culated throughout the university con-

-cerning the issue.

The petition, in favor ofretaining
Health America, was circulated over
the five Pitt campuses and received
1,200 signatures. _

The survey was circulated to gather
opinions from faculty and staff mem-
bers over the health care issue. Sixty
percent of the surveys sent out were
returned.

SGB   looks

at possible
Pih‘ escorts

By Nathan Hughes
Staff Writer -

The Student Government
Board is making safety an
issue on Pitt’s campus. One
of the major steps the board
is taking-toward campus-
wide safety is a proposal for
a student escort service.
The proposed escort service
is not yet finalized; details
are still being worked out.

The main obstacle deals
with funding for the pro-
gram. Currently, it is not
known where the money for
the service would come
from. SGB discussed the
escort service at Monday
night’s meeting.

“The problem we’re hav-
ing is finding funding for
the service. We don’t expect
one group from the univer-

Options to deal with roommate con f/icts

sity to pay for the entire
fee,” said SGB member
Patrick Huey.

Staff Writer

When junior Joe Nelson moved into an apart-
ment last year with two friends, he ended‘ up
taking one of them to court.

His roommate, Bob, moved out midway

through the year, breaking their lease, and the.

lease made all three of them responsible for
paying all of the rent.

Nelson never found anyone to replace Bob.
When he didn’t pay his share of the rent, Nelson
tried to collect it from Bob, but he refused.

Nelson and his other roommate ﬁled a com-
plaint with the District Magistrate for $745
against Bob.

“We signed the lease from August to August.
Bob got kicked out of Pitt, and he didn’t tell us
he wasn’t coming back, never attempted to find
anyone and never gave us time to find some-
one,” Nelson said. He and the other roommate
were told as they were leaving for the holiday

break that Bob would not be returning in
January. »

Whether students live on or off campus, most
of the time they will have roommates. Whether

‘students live with friends or complete strangers,

problems can arise between roommates and
over any number of things.

Nelson knew both of his roommates before
they all moved in together.

“Bob was a pledge brother of mine,” Nelson
said. -

One of the biggest problems students have
with renting apartments is roommates who
break the lease and move out, leaving the
remaining roommates to cover the rent. When
many leases for student apartments are drawn, it
gives all the renters joint liability to make sure
the whole amount of the rentis paid, even if one

4 person doesn’t pay his share.

“The landlord told us the legal actions we
needed to take, but we had to do it on our own,”
,°R0ommates, page 3

However, he also said that
they would like to shy away
from raising the tuition
and/or activities fee.

“If at all possible, I’d like
to avoid raising tuition or
the activities fee, but the
student government does
not have the money to_ade-
quately fund this kind of
program,” Huey stated.

The cost of the escort ser-
vice is estimated to linger
somewhere around $60,000
per year.

Two members ‘of the SGB
recently took a trip to
Florida State University to
observe the escort service
there that has been extreme-
ly successful. Thus far, not

CROATIA — Croatian Serbs
protested changes in the role of
United Nations peacekeepers in
the country when only a few
days earlier Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman announced
peacekeepers could stay in the
country only if they expanded
their mandate.

His proposal wanted peace-
keepers to conduct boarder
patrols to stop the move of arms
to the Serbs.

Recently President Tudjman
reversed his stance because
since his proposal, there has
been considerable movement of
tanks into eastern Croatia from
Serbia. President Tudjman said

he felt Croatian Serbs were try-

Roommates

said Nelson. “It didn’t matter
where [the rent] came from,
but we were responsible for
paying it.”

According to Mark
Galzerano, the legal advisor to

students sponsored by the

Student Government, Board,
“There isno written agreement
for paying rent and utilities.
There is just an oral agreement
between the roommates.”

Galzerano suggested room-
mates take preventive.mea-
sures, like their own contracts,
when moving into an apart-
ment together.

“Why not sign a private
agreement to split utilities and
rent? This will give them a
backing,” he said. This is espe-
cially recommended in cases
where you answer an ad or a

flyer that says, “Roommate I

needed for ...”

account is responsible for all
charges on the bill. TCI said

that more than one name’

may be put on the account to
assure all roommates are billed
fairly.

There are options for those

.students who are already in a

tough roommate situation. One
option is to try to Sublease the
apartment. Most of the time,
this will require the landlord’s
approval, but it may not always
be easy to find someone. The
other option is for the room-
mates to go after the one who
has moved out.

Galzerano said, “It’s tough 
the roommate who moves out
doesn’t always leave a for-
warding address.” .

Before deciding to sue,

‘Nelson said he tried to person-
ally contact his former room-

mate.

“His mom kept, making
excuses for him, saying he was
never home.”

Nelson spoke to her and tried
to convince her to pay, but she
refused. She legally wasn’t

responsible either, since there
wasn’t parental co—signing of

the lease.

_When students come to him
with roommate complaints,
Galzerano will point them to
the district justice, who hears
these kinds of complaints.
Eileen Conroy is the magistrate
who presides in Oakland.

Cost and time may be‘ a fac-
tor in suing a delinquent room-

' mate. The filing fee is $30 and

higher. Nelson paid $45. The
district justice will hear the
complaint, set up a hearing
date and let the defendant
know. '

“If they present their case
well, most of the time the
plaintiff will win,” Galzerano
said. “But the problem with the
system is that the judge will
give the judgment [in favor of
the plaintiff], but it is up to the
plaintiff to collect. The judge
doesn’t make them pay.”

Nelson won his case because
Bob never showed at the hear-
ing. However, Bob still hasn’t
paid, so Nelson and his other

roommate are taking further
legal steps to collect the money
owed to them. .

Most disputes will end there,
especially if the plaintiffs
threaten to have the judgment
put on the defendant’s credit
record.

Galzerano said, “Any deci-
sion can be appealed to com-
mon pleas court if it is under
$20,000.”

For those who are not sold
on renting an apartment,_ an
option is to stay in the resi-
dence halls. But even then,
roommate problems can occur.
Although a roommate may
move out without any financial
burden to other roommates,
getting along with one another
can be tough.

“There tends to be a lot of
problems with friends _[living
together], especially friends
from high school moving in

together in college,” second- ’

year Resident Assistant Elena
Schwartz said. “You actually

may feel more comfortable-

_asking strangers to be accom-

modating than your friends.”

If problems begin, there are a
few solutions.

Schwartz said, ”The first

thing is to try to talk to your

roommate. if that doesn’t work,
then talk to your RA. He or she
will probably give you a room-
mate contract to coordinate
sleeping and studying sched-
ules.” V.

Most problems arise from
conﬂicting schedules, but some
situations just won’t work.

“If the roommate contracts
don’t work, and you’ve met
with the Resident Director, and
if it is hopeless, then we will
put in for a room change
request,” said Schwartz.

“The Office of Residence
Life will have to approve the
change. They won’t approve
them because of your room-
mate’s race or [sexual prefer-

ence]...It has to be a legitimate 5

reason,” Schwartz warned.
Finding a roommate for any

situation can be difficult, but ,

more times than not, things
will run smoothly.

For fast relief from the nagging ache of taxes,

tax-deferred annuities designed to help build
additional assets—money that can help make the
difference between living and living well after your
working years are over.

Contributions to your SRAS are deducted from
your salary on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes
right away. What's more‘, any earnings on your
SRAS arealso tax-deferred until you receive them
as income. That can make a big difference in how

painful your tax bill is every year.

Ensuring the future
for those who shape it.“

As the nation's largest retirement system, we
offer a wide range of allocation choices-—from
TIAA's traditional annuity, with its guarantees of
principal and interest, to the seven diversified
investment accounts of CREF's variable annuity.
What's more, our expenses are very low,“ which
means more ofyour money goes toward improving
your future financial health.

Dred Scott Decision to the current
and recurrent debates about affirma-

have been denied the privilege of
being part of the American main-

During the 1880s and into the 20th
century, Native American children
were rounded up on reservations in
western states by federal authorities
and herded by train to such places as
Carlisle, Pa., to be educated by
western values. These children were
not permitted to speak their own lan-
guage. Forced to cut their hair and
dress as European-American chil-
dren, they were punished severely
for any behavior that was interpreted
as practicing their native culture.
They were made to reject their lan-
guage and their culture to conform
to an Anglo model of success.

right. Not until the 20th century
were they permitted to vote in this
country. Though they have made
many gains, they still earn less than
their male counterparts in the work-
place. Women today continue to
strive for equitable inclusion in the

Understanding the nature of
resentment to words such as multi-
culturalism, cultural pluralism and
diversity is important. For those who
think and feel that the only “right”
education is that of a Eurocentric
nature, it is easier to be negative
about the word than to deal with
their own biases. The idea of diver-
sity is not a bland or innocent word;
rather, it is a word fraught with feel-
ing and threat to those who may per-
ceive that promoting diversity may
undermine or threaten their posi-
tions. The word is being questioned
by many as to whether it is an
acceptable word or whether it
denotes the undermining of pre-
exisiting advantages of the quite
undiverse group. In other words,

diversity becomes the scapegoat.

In questioning the word, an inter-
esting phenomenon has occured. The
word takes on a negative connota-
tion not admitted but strongly felt.
In taking on this connotation, the
implication is that the word is the
problem, rather than the underlying
attitude that led to the need to devel-
op special programs in the first
place. Rather than admit to our-
selves or others that we feel threat-
ened by the broader inclusion, we
object to the word. This is not a way
to solve a severe social problem,
because it masks the objection and
resistance to any change. Instead of
changing or deleting the words, we
should get to the underlying feelings

and attitudes that lead to the resis-

tance to the policy and the outcomes
of that policy.

What we must address ishow to
eliminate bias, discrimination and
racism. Recognizing and celebrating
cultural difference does not imply a
rejection of common ground, nor
does it suggest a Balkanization of

American culture. In fact, if
Balkanization of American culture
occurs, it occurs because other cul-
tures of a non-Anglo origin have
been and continue to be denied visi-
bility by the mainstream.
Celebrating our differences
acknowledges the geocultural world
in which we all must live. It allows
us the opportunity to balance our
duality, the dichotomy that for many
of us has often been suppressed or
denied. V

Words are the tools of human

' beings to use to enlighten or darken

the world view. They create sun-
shine or cast shadows; they connote,
they denote, they deconstruct. They
are powerful! The word diversity
possesses all these potentials. In an
educational setting such as the uni-
versity community with its many
representatives from a multitude of
diasporas, it’s a marvelous word to
have around. It’s alive! Now we
must move diversity beyond the uni-
versity walls and give it life in our

a single student has been
harmed while being escort-
ed.

“It’s a student-run, amaz-
ingly efficient and success-
ful escort system that has
withstood the test of time,”
said SGB President Julie
Crowell.

The way in which FSU’s
escort system works is that
students employed by the
university a-re paid (around
$4.50/hour) to escort other
students from one place to
another. There are usually
five escorts on duty each
night, making roughly 40
escort trips per night. They
work until two in the morn-
ing, when the library closes.

FSU’s student government
funds the entire escort ser-
vice, employing up to a total
of 20 students.

“Florida State can do this
because they have a $5 mil-
lion budget for their student

government. We have-

$500,000,” said Huey.

In order to gain backing
for the program, the SGB
plans on gathering student
support, as well as support
from various other student
groups, particularly
women’s groups.

“We’re going to try to
generate a great deal of stu-
dent support, especially
through groups like the
Campus Women’s

Organization, Panhellenic_

Association and traditional-
ly women’s groups that are
interested in this sort of pro-
ject,” Huey stated.

Crowell said she hopes the .

proposal passes and that she
feels the escort service
would serve as‘a great
benefit for the students at
Pitt.

“Safety in numbers is the
whole concept,” said
Crowell. “It’s just nice to
have somebody there, let
alone someone‘ that is

‘trained who can get you

where you want to go.”

The proposed escort ser-
vice for Pitt integrates ideas
from a number of different
universities that maintain
escort services.

“Our proposal incorpo-
rates not only ideas from
Florida State, but a lot of
programs from the Urban 13
Conference. It’s a combina-
tion of 13 or 14 different
systems that we looked at
closely and researched,”
Huey stated.

_In other student govern-
ment news:

°The Student Government

dent affairs.

°Crowell announced there

will be an increase in the

available in the upcoming

°Crowell also announced
there is a good chance that
the Tower C Cafeteria will
be closing at the start of
next year due to the lack of
students eating there. A
recent prime rib dinner
failed to draw a large
turnout.

°Finally, Crowell
announced that the SGB is

“This is a very big deal,
and we don’t want to com-
ment before we are familiar

invited other assembly members to sign on ‘with his initia-

Also, Faculty Assembly unanimously passed a motion to
support an annual faculty evaluation policy similar to the

‘one already existing in the faculty handbook. There had

been some call to institute a new five-year evaluation poli-
cy.

Holland is against a new five-year review policy and said
the problem with the existing policy is that it isn’t
implemented evenly throughout the university departments.

“Why would we replace one policy that doesn’t work with
another that doesn’t work?” he said. The revised annual

Op ' nions
Light ' em up

On Saturday, the Pitt police ran across two young men not
affiliated with Pitt burning a flag in the Panther Hollow
parking lot. When they radioed back ..to their supervisor to
find out what to do with the miscreants, they found that by
Pennsylvania state law, one cannot burn or deface the ﬂag of
the commonwealth or the United States. So, they took the
two boys into custody.

Their defense will be that in 1989, the Supreme Court
ruled that flag burning was a legitimate form of political
expression and thus protected by the First Amendment to the
Constitution.

According to the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, the youths
said that they burned the flag to protest the government
and claimed to have a history of protesting things. One
student, Shawn Lupka, said that he hasprotested by refus-
ing to stand for the pledge of allegiance in high school.
Yet this rebel appears to have very little idea about making
an effective protest, committing his heinous act where
people in power were least likely to see him. He told the
Post-Gazette that this protest was incited by finding a
small flag on a stick as he was walking through the parking
lot.

Despite the fact that in this case there was probably very
little justification for burning the flag, nevertheless, the right
to burn the flag must be upheld as a fo'rm of freedom of
expression. Indeed, there may be other ways to express dis-
satisfaction with the state of the union, the actions of the
government or the country itself, but this is also a form of
expression which should be maintained.

It is interesting to note that on the same pages with the
article about the flag burning there are stories about murders
and robberies. Clearly there are more important thingsto
worry about than someone setting fire to pieces of cloth in
order to draw attention to themselves. If they were to use the

ﬂag as a wick on a Molotov cocktail, then there would be i

more cause for worry. Perhaps by allowing the freedom for
this expression, the necessary attention will be drawn to big-
ger problems. It is important not to lose sight of the forest
for the trees here.

The one benefit that this case may have is that it could
lead to the Pennsylvania law being overturned. This law
clearly runs counter to the Constitution on which the country
is founded. The whole is greater than any one of the parts.
When states are allowed to pick and choose what parts of the
Constitution they will follow, then there is no longer a
nation, but merely a loose affiliation of states.

It is important to remember that the flag is merely a sym-
bol of the freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. If
the government were to take overly stringent methods to
protect symbols, them we have become too simple-minded
in thinking about what America means.

Nostalgia is something more than breakfast

oy, do I miss the ‘80s.
B No, I’m not on any
medication. Nor am I
George Bush, who in the ‘80s
had something_ that vaguely
resembled the respect of other
people. Neither yet am I Tears
For Fears, who had something
that vaguelyresembled a lead
vocalist. .
The fact is, everything was
right with the world in the
‘80s. OK, maybe not quite
everything — Jim Bakker was

- running around free for a large

portion of the decade —- but
for the most part, exquisite
simplicity reigned. The accept-_
ed paradigm was one of pure
and unadulterated quest for
luxurious gratification. On the
other hand, an excellent symp-
tom of the problem with the
‘90s is that our major cultural
icons would have stated the
last sentencein the _words,

“Stuff was cool. Huh huh, huh

huh.”

Take radio, for example. The
‘80s airwaves were ruled by
friendly, jocular guys like
Casey Kasem and John
DeBe1la. You know — the
type of DJs you’d invite to
marry your little sister, and
please take all of her clothes
out of MY closet space while
you’re at it, thank you very
much. Who do we have today?
Howard Stern — who wants
people to call him “Fartman.”
Do I really need to actually
write down the words, “defi-
nitely not the sort of guy you
would want your sister to
marry, unless your sister hap-
pened to be Imelda Marcos, in
which case they would deserve
each other?”

Kids were better off back
then, too, since the ‘80s were
the last time you could find
real Star Wars action ﬁgures.
These days, all we have are
Star Wars Micro Machines
that are about as .easy to play
with as gnats, and George “I’m
Growing My Beard ‘Til I Look
Like A Wookie” Lucas
promising us every year, “Uh

. next year. Next year I’ll

definitely make a new Star
Wars movie.” Right, George.
Definitely. And monkeys
might ﬂy outta my  ah, but
that’s a ‘90s saying.

There were other great toys '

for kids back in the ‘80s, too. I
mean — we had Transformers!
Surely you remember Optimus
Prime, the tractor trailer who
turned into a heroic robot
leader, kind of like a big,
clunky Abraham Lincoln.

Whereas today — and I swear ’

this is 100 percent, absolutely,
totally true —- today I saw a
television commercial that
went like this: “New from Hot

Wheels Adventures — the‘

Jungle Tracker! It’s an
armored truck that transforms
into an Amazon rain forest!”
And it really did. I’m all for
making kids aware of environ-
mental issues, but this is just
too weird. Does it come with a
dastardly little Brazilian real
estate developer?

And don’t even get me start-
ed about music. Hasn’t anyone
else noticed that every single
“new” genre in the music
world of the ‘90s is just an
imitation of a great ‘80s band
or musician? “Alternative
Rock” —- I scoff at the words.
A better label would be
“People Who Really Wish
They Were Peter Gabriel.”
And these “Techno-Industrial”
bands —— um, yeah, we’ve
heard it, except back then it
was called INXS, and all the
songs sounded the same even
when it was just INXS.

As for the whole nouveau-
upbeat rock thing of the mid-
’90s — Crash Test Dummies,
Counting Crows, all of ‘em —
I have just one word:
Philadelphia. Yes, the city. The
town that rocked the nation
when it gave birth to the origi-
nal that they all seem to “pay
homage” to. You’ve guessed
it: The Hooters. It is one of the
colossal sins of our time that
the ‘90s has seen the name of
such a pivotal force in musical
history perverted into a slang
term for women's breasts.

Now, right at this moment,
one of two things are going on
in your skull. If you’re a mem-
ber of the same generation as
myself — we’ll shy away from
that irritating, offensive term
for us, if you please — you’re
probably smiling in wistful
nostalgia and“ hoping, that no
one can hear you thinking,
“Yeah! Transformers were

- cool!” If this is the case, my
—message to you is simple: It’s

not too late. Refuse to buy all
the crap out there that clueless
marketing‘ execs are targeting
at Generation X.
(Aaarrrggghhh! Well, I tried.)

Write to George Lucas and
tell him you want a new Star
Wars movie RIGHT NOW,
and if you have to sit through
another movie like
Leprechaun, you will almost
certainly smash your head
between your copies of Al
Gore’s book and Ross Perot’s
book, and he will lose a valu-
able ticket sale.

If, on the other hand, you
belong to an older ‘generation
— the infamous Boomers, for
example — you likely have no
idea what this column was
about. You read what I said
about music and said, “But
doesn’t this shallow punk real-
ize that Alternative Rock,
Techno-Industrial, and upbeat
rock ALL came directly from
the Beatles’ White Album?”
My message to YOU is equal-
ly simple: Stop making
armored trucks that transform
into Amazon rain forests! If
you think MY generation is
screwed up, can you imagine
what you’re doing to the kids
out there now? If this contin-
ues, mothers will soon be giv-
ing simultaneous birth to
babies and the psychiatrists
that the poor kids are gonna
need.

Ah, I give up. Let’s just
regress to the ‘20s and start lis-
tening to Al Jolson again.

Pitt basket-

, ball team,
Columnist including
Matt four of New

Gr0ff York City’s

native sons
last week, but not before the
Panthers put an end to ques-
tions about the caliber of
basketball that is developing
in the Steel City.

Pitt’s season ended with a
81-78 loss to heavily favored
UConn on Friday after the
Panthers notched their first
Big East tourney victory in

, five years, giving a scare to

one of the top teams in the
country.

“This is a team with a
tremendous amount of heart
and played well today,” Pitt
coach Ralph Willard said.
“All things considered, it has
been a great season.”

Willard, a Brooklyn native,
may not yet be the most pop-
ular coach in a conference
loaded with personalities and
a history of coaching leg-
ends, but you know he’s
gaining ground.

“I said when Ralph Willard
came into the league he
would cause hell, and he
has,” UConn head coach Jim

‘Calhoun said after the Pitt

game. “But I thought it
might take three or four

, years. I really didn’t want it

to happen right away like
this.” '

Willard and the Panthers
have left their mark in New
York in several ways this
season, not the least of which
is their record. Pitt finished
with a 3-1 record in the New
York City Metropolitan area
this season (three at Madison
Square Garden, one at the
Meadowlands). New York is
the only city in which Pitt
won Big East games outside
of Pittsburgh. In fact, Pitt’s
three Big East victories in
New York was one more
than its total of two at home
this season.

The Big Apple seemed to
especially bring out the best
in its native boys, because
the Panthers showed no signs
of a team with manpower
shortage or a losing record.

Orlando Antigua, who
hails from the Bronx and has
taken more than his fair
share of criticism for Pitt’s
record this season, had one
of the best games of his
career against UConn,
including a perfect 3-for-3
from trey land and 17 total
points. More impressive,

NEW YORK — Pitt’s emo-

came to an end, but not before
it gave one last exhilarating
ride at the Big East tourna-
ment.

After upsetting No. 8-seeded
St. John’s 74-71 on its home
ﬂoor, Madison Square Garden,
which broke a five-game Pitt
losing streak at the tournament,
the ninth-seeded Panthers met
the top-ranked Connecticut
Huskies in the quarterfinals
and gave them everything they
could handle before faltering
81-78 last Friday.

“I don’t think it was a subpar
season, I think it was one hell
of a season,” coach Ralph
Willard said after the loss.
“Considering what these kids
have gone through, and
Orlando [Antigua] and Chris
Gant are the only people who
played any appreciable minutes
prior to this year; we won the
lastfive out of seven games
before this game and taking the
No. 1 seed down to the wire, I
don’t think it’s a subpar season,
I think it’s one hell of a sea-

Pitt sends five wrestlers to NCAAs

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

All of the pain and sacrifice
that wrestlers go through in the
course of a season paid off for
five members of the Pitt
wrestling team, as they earned
the right to compete at the
NCAA tournament.

The NCAA tournament in
wrestling is for the wrestlers
who have advanced past their
conference tournaments to
determine which men will
achieve All—America status.
Unlike in sports such as bas-
ketball and football, All-
Americans aren’t voted on by
the media. That title is earned
on the mat.

The Eastern Wrestling
League held its post-season
tournament at West Virginia
University in Morgantown the
first weekend in March.

The Pitt wrestling team as a
whole placed third behind
Edinboro and Lock Haven,
with Pitt being represented in
five of the championship
matches.

J.J. Fasnacht won his divi-

sion, with Brett Gould, Bryan
Matusic, John Withrow and
Pat Wiltanger all placing sec-
ond in their weight classes.
Freshman Chad Jesko was
chosen as an alternate to repre-
sent the conference at this
weekend’s tournament at Iowa.
Only the top three places in the
respective divisions advance to
nationals.

“The guys who qualified all
wrestled really well,” assistant
coach Jim Beichner said, “and
I’ve never seen J . J . [Fasnacht]
wrestle a better match than one
that he won the 134-pound
division.”

Fasnacht wrestled the entire

year in the 142-pound division,

but dropped down to 134 for
the EWL’s to try and give him-
self a competitive advantage.

Although a little gassed after
the first couple of matches,
Fasnacht rebounded the next
day to claim the title despite
having to drop eight extra
pounds to get down to the
proper weight requirement.

“I was real tired after the
second period of my second
match. I even got called for

stalling twice during the third
period,” Fasnacht said. “But I
felt good during the final
match.”

Pitt’s Brett Gould injured his
knee during the third period of
the finals of his weight class.
The cartilage damage to his
knee will prevent him from
competing in nationals.

“It’s a shame,” Beichner
said. “He was up "in the second
period, and the injury just
wouldn’t allow him to get over
the top.”

At heavyweight, Wiltanger
placed second despite being
outweighed a substantial
amount by some of his oppo-
nents.

“Pat competed real hard
against guys 20 and 30 pounds
heavier than him,” Beichner
said. “He went and competed
real hard in the finals.”

To prepare for nationals, the
Panthers have been placed on a
lighter training regiment than
usual. . _

“All the work is in,”- Matusic
said. “We’re going light on the
weights. Yesterday was our

8-2 on trip

The Pitt baseball team
returned home after a week
hiatus in Florida, where the
Panthers went 8-2 for the
spring trip.

Pitt won its first ‘sixth games
before being upended by
Hofstra, 7-2, on March 10. Pitt
rebounded from the loss by
downing LaSal1e 5-4, and
Fairleigh Dickinson 3-2. The
Panthers other loss came in the
tri-p’s finale against Western
Illinois. The Leathemecks beat
Pitt 7-4.

Sophomore outfielder Jason
Conti led the offensive attack
by hitting a cool .371, and also
added seven stolen bases in
eight attempts. In Pitt’s 13-3
win over Boston College,
Conti went 3-for-4 with three
RBI.

Also, freshman first base-
man Jeff Murse filled the
departed Craig Crawley’s

was for real. However, they also
found out his shooting was not
quite up to an incredible upset of
the toumey’s top team.

Shooting guard Jason Maile,
who has been Pitt’s sixth man all
year, had shot in double figures‘
in his past seven games. In the
two games previous to Pitt’s
meeting with top-seeded
UConn, Maile led the squad
with 25 and 28 points respec-
tively, along with a total of 10
three-pointers. ‘

But credit UConn’s defense '

with preventing Maile from
delivering another standout per-
fonnance.

“I wasn’t especially trying to
take a lot of shots or looking to
get hot,” Maile said after the
Panther’s 81-78 loss to UConn

last Friday. “I was driving and ’

looking to kick it out. When they
were covered, I’d take the shot
myself. [UConn] was playing
tight defense.”

Unfortunately for Pitt, when

Maile ended up taking the shot,
he only hit two of seven for
eight points against UConn.
' “We played hard and well,”
Maile said. “We were trying
hard to work on [defense] and
let the offense come to us, but
came up a little short.”

His presencewas noticeably
missing after giving fits to the
defense and seemingly scoring
at will the night before against
St John’s.

“Jason Maile put on quite a
shooting performance tonight,
we just couldn’t stop him,” a
frustrated Brian Mahoney, St.
John’s head coach, said after
Pitt’s ﬁrst-round victory. “[Pitt
head coach] Ralph [Willard] had
some good screens and made
them work. Maile was getting
free all night.”

Maile’s 28-point, 63 percent
shooting performance against
the Red Storm was the highest
game total for any Panther this
season. He contributed five
three-pointers in the game in
which Pitt set a Big East
Tournament record for treys
with 11. In addition, he just
missed a double—double with a
game-high nine rebounds.

“Over the past two years, I’ve
watched him develop into one of
the best jump shooters in this
league,” Mahoney said. Pitt head
coach Ralph \Villard said Maile
is doing a “terrific job” and is
encouraged by his improvement.

However, Maile said his team-
mates were the reason for his

improved shooting displays.

“[Having such a good game]
feels good, but all the credit goes
to Andre [Alridge] and the other
guys getting the ball to me like
they did,” Maile said. “My
teammates were getting me
some good looks, and the shots
were just falling tonight.” '

He opened the St. J ohn’s game
with a scorching seven—for-10
shooting in the ﬁrst half, nailing
17 of his points and keeping Pitt
close as the Red Storm tried to
pull away.

“You never know if [the shots]
will be falling like that,” Maile
said. “Coach’s plays were work-
ing real well. My teammates

' were setting good screens and

leaving me with great shots.”

' Maile finished the season
shooting a hefty 41 percent in
three-point ﬁeld goals, leading
the Panther squad. Also, Maile
finished second to Alridge in
total three-pointers with 58. The
numbers bode well for the red-
shirt sophomore who has two
more years to show the Big East

“The future [at Pitt] looks
great,” Maile said. “I think it
took a little while to get into
coach’s system, but the future of
Pitt basketball is hustle and

intensity, and I think we started ,-

to show it this year.”

However, after the UConn
game, Maile said the main rea-
son he is sad’ to see the season
end is the loss of his teammates.
Pitt will lose three key contribu-
tors in Orlando Antigua, Chris
Gant and Jaime Peterson to
graduation this year. Antigua
and Gant have been mainstays in
the Pitt lineup since the 1991-92
season.

“We played hard and well.
They are a greatteam who plays
well together, and they run the

fast break as well as anybody. .

They have a chance to go far

“I’ve played with Chris and
Orlando for three years, and they
are great people to play with,”
Maile said. ”They went out in
style and helped show people
what we’re made of.” .

the waning minute of the game.

The ﬁrst came with 26 seconds
left, when UConn point guard
Kevin Ollie drove the lane and
it appeared Andre Alridge took
a charge, but the referees called
a blocking foul and Ollie sank
both free throws to put the
Huskies up 81-77.

Following Ollie’s free throws,
Pitt raced the ball up court and
Garrick Thomas misfired on a
three-pointer, but Jaime
Peterson grabbed the rebound
on the baseline. Husky center
Travis Knight slapped the ball
out of Peterson’s hands; one ref-
eree pointed in Pitt’s posses-
sion, the other pointed UConn’s
way. To a frantic Willard’s dis-
may, the Huskies kept the ball
with 11. 7 seconds remaining.

1 “Coming down the stretch
there were two tough plays that
really determined the basketball
game,” Willard said. “I certain-
ly would like to see the kids
decideit.”

Pitt fouled Ray Allen imme-

' diately, wasting only two sec-

onds off the clock. Allen missed
both attempts, and Alridge took
the ball coast to coast with reck-
less abandon and was fouled.
Alridge missed the ﬁrst one and

connected on the second, cut-
ting the lead to three, but that’s
how the game would end.

“I’m not happy the way we
played, but I’m very proud of
the way they played,” Husky
coach Jim Calhoun said.
“Pittsburgh gave us everything
we could handle. They executed
well.”

The game opened the same
way it closed, with the two
teams exchanging baskets and
defensive stops. But on Allen’s
baseline three-pointer, UConn
opened up an eight-point lead
with 15 minutes left in the first
half.

Pitt raced right back with a
quick nine—point run, capped off
by Orlando A‘ntigua’s three-
pointer off the dribble to take a
16-15 lead.

With under five minutes to
play, Jason Maile strung five
straight points and Antigua con-
nected on another three to give
Pitt a 10-point advantage before
Calhoun called a time out to
regroup. After the time out,
UConn went on a 12-3 run to
slice Pitt’s lead to 40-39 head-
ing into halftime. Forward
Donny Marshall did most of the
damage, as he scored eight
points in the ﬁnal three minutes.

frame. Just 13 seconds into the
half Antigua stole a pass and
found Peterson for a layup.
Then, off another steal, Garrick
Thomas connected on a three-
point bomb way beyond the arc.
But soon after, Gant would
pick up his fourth foul. Gant
was hampered with foul trouble
the whole game, and would
eventually foul out with 9:51
remaining. It was the second
game in a row Gant fouled out.
Just as the Panthers’ momen-
tum kicked into full throttle,
UConn lashed out with a seven-
point run in less than a minute,
cutting the lead to 49-47 with
14:54 remaining. Willard called
a time out to settle his team.
Out of the time out, Antigua
hit a baseline three-pointer. But
the Huskies raced back with a
9-0 run, capped off by an Allen
steal, who almost leaped over
Alridge who was planted for the
charge. The hoop gave UConn a
56-52 advantage and ignited the
whole Husky entourage.
Altogether, UConn went on a
16-3 run in about three minutes.
Pitt looked as though it was
going to crumble. Traveling and

the Center for Student Community Service, will facilitate the meeting to
help us plan a cooperative community service event. Berger organized the
February SGB community service project; SGB assisted at the Western PA
School for the Blind’s Annual Scavenger Hunt on Feb. 16. Next month, we
will have a booth at the Hand-in-Hand Festival on March 25, and we will
help with the ”Scouting for Food” drive in April. Berger discussed plans
with Karrie Valauri of CGS; SGB will host a booth soliciting students to
donate on April 19. Berger spoke with Bob Stanish of TCI; plans are pro-
gressing for the cable information channel. She is also investigating improv-
ing the computer updating of daily events. Berger has continued to attend
the biweekly Panhel meetings. Also, Berger and Ufberg have attended the
weekly PPC meetings. Berger collected applications for the Community
Relations Committee. Eleven people were chosen to be on the committee;
CRC meetings will be held on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm in the SGB office.

JOHN CALLAHAN: Callahan spent the majority of the month preparing .
the Student Government Board budget, and the budgets of its corrunittees.
The budget was submitted and the SGB had its budget hearing on the 22nd
of February. Callahan continued to attend the RSA weekly meetings and is
pleased with the progress of that office. Febuary 3rd, Callahan and Andy
Miller, President of RSA, met with Dave Homyak of ORL to discuss relevant
issues for resident students, and student complaints. Callahan attended the
Pittsburgh Area Student Leaders Conference with other members of the
board on February 1st. Plans for the new ‘Student Run First Responder
System are underway. - »

motion requesting the Pitt News to articulate guidelines employed by them
regarding the usage of pictures, graphics and copy in the paper.

JULIE CLOUSE: Clouse has been in the process of improving recycling
efforts on campus. She has been meeting with administrators from both
Facilities Management and Housing to discuss the current situation. Right
now, Pitt only recycles a low percentage of trash and she hopes to work on
ways to increase this percentage. A very successful Recycling Week was
held February 8-10. Members of SGB, SEAC, CWO, Circle K, and RSA
helped to educate students and increase awareness of the need to recycle.
Clouse has been receiving results from a survey she sent out to all major
advisors. Advisors were surveyed to find out about their current method of
welcoming newly declared students to their major. Clouse attended the

' Conference of Student Government Associations at Texas A & M University.

The conference provided information on ways to battle student apathy and
also ways to increase visibility of SGB. She also worked on improving the
duties of Representatives to Senate Committees. Interviews for new repre-
sentatives was held March 1. Applications were accepted for an Elections
Committee Chairperson; one will be selected following the interviews.

PATRICK HUEY: This month work has continued on the proposal for a
student escort service. The first draft is finished and work should be com-
pleted by the end of March. On Feb. 3 Huey spoke with Dan Perez of
Florida State University's Student Government. A fact finding trip was pro-
posed to research their implementation of an escort service. On March 8-10
Crowell and Huey will visit Florida State and report their findings.

But the Panthers raced right
back. After scoring four straight
points, Thomas hit a four-footer
on the baseline and Maile deliv-
ered a three-pointer to recapture
the momentum and the lead, 61-
60, with 8:56 remaining.

“Coach said when they [the
Huskies] make their run, just
keep plugging and match their
emotion,” said Peterson, who
scored 15 points and nabbed 16
boards in his final collegiate
game.

Thanks to Thomas, who
scored seven consecutive points
and took a charge after he
missed a shot, Pitt still clung to
a 68-67 lead with 6:34 left.

. Thomas finished with a team-

high 18 points in 23 minutes.

Four straight points by
Marshall and a Doron Sheffer
free throw split gave UConn a
four-point cushion, 75-71, with
3:22 left. Following a timeout,
Antigua buried a running one-
handed jumper to cut the lead to
two.

But with 1:52 Antigua picked
up his ﬁfth foul, and both senior
starting forwards were fouled
out.

“I was trying to hold back my
emotions. I didn’t want it to
end,” Antigua said. “It’s been a
great season. It’s going to be
hard to leave.”

Antigua overcame a poor
shooting performance the night
before to ﬁnish with 17 points,
while connecting on seven-for-
10 from the field.

But Pitt refused to fold. After

came the controversial calls to
end Pitt’s improbable upset bid.

The Panthers ended the sea-
son with an 11-18 record, and 5-
13 in Big East play.

“I said when Ralph Willard
came into the league he would
cause hell, and he has,”
Calhoun said. “He can coach,
and his kids play all out and
very loose. But we found a way
to win, and the important thing
is we’re playing tomorrow.”

BLUE-GOLD STORM

History means nothing, espe-
cially when the ante is amplified
to do-or-die circumstances such
as the Big East Tournament.

Entering this season, Pitt was
4-12 the tournament, and the
last time the Panthers had won
was in 1990 over Boston
College in the elimination
round. Since then, Pitt had
dropped five straight tourna-
ment games.

Additionally, Pitt had played
the St. John’s Red Storm twice
prior to this year in the tourna-
ment and had lost both games.

But the Panthers overcame all
the odds stacked up against
them and broke the drought,
beating St. John’s 74-71 in front
of its hometown fans at
Madison Square Garden
Thursday night. This was the

second time this season Pitt beat

the Red Storm at the Garden.

“We’re enjoying it, but we’re
not ecstatic,” Willard said after
the game. “We have a great
desire to get better, and that’s
been our goal all season. We
have less than 24 hours to get
ready for an excellent
Connecticut team.”

Pitt used a tournament record
11 three-pointers to advance —
five coming from shooting
guard Jason Maile, who fin-
ished with career-highs 28
points and nine rebounds.

Also, the Panthers killed St.
John’s on the boards. Pitt outre-
bounded the Red Storm 24-8 on
the offensive glass and 45-29
overall.

“Our goal every game is to
come out and get 20 offensive
rebounds,” Willard said. “The
other thing we try to do is shoot
a lot of threes, and that enables
us to get a lot of offensive
rebounding opportunities.”

Again, the game boiled down
to the ﬁnal minutes. Down 68-
66 at the 2:10 mark, Antigua,
who was 0-for-8 at that point,
hit a three-pointer with the shot
clock dwindling down. Pitt
would never relinquish the lead
after that.

Soon after, James Scott, who
scored 27 points, split a pair of
free throws to cut the lead to
one. St. John’s regained posses-
sion but turned it over to Andre
Alridge, who was fouled.
Alridge converted on both ends
of the one-and-one, giving the
Panthers a 72-69 advantage
with 1:17 left.

With less than a minute to go,
star freshman Felipe Lopez,
who was dead-cold the whole
game (three of 10), tried to tie
the score with an errant three-

pointer. Lopez’s shot bricked off
the backboard and into Pitt’s
hands.

St. John’s immediately fouled
Alridge, Pitt’s leading free
throw shooter. But he missed
the front end of the one-and-
one, giving the Red Storm a
glimpse of hope.

. St. John’s worked the ball
around and strangely enough
scored on a Lopez layup, eras-
ing Pitt’s three point lead to one,
72-71, with 4.4 ticks remaining.

St. John’s fouled Alridge
again, but this time he connect-
ed on both free throws, which
all but ended the game. Alridge
finished with 19 points, six
assists and, most importantly,
only one turnover.

“In the end we felt if we
didn’t need the three we were
going to try and get two if the
kid [Alridge] made those free

throws [because St. John’s
would have needed two posses- L

sions], but he missed them,”
Red Storm coach Brian
Mahoney said of their last pos-
session. “Sometimes kids don’t
react the way you’d like them to
react. We took it inside, but we
were trying to get the three and
it just didn’t happen.”

The Pitt win came over a St.
John’s team that had beaten
Villanova, Syracuse and
Georgetown in the 10 days prior
to the game.

“I wanted them to end on a
good note. That was our goal as
underclassmen, to play hard and
send them out on a good note,”
said sophomore Chad Varga of
the three graduating seniors —
Gant, Antigua and Peterson.

It was Varga’s first game back
since his wrist surgery Jan. 9.

  FR EE

Varga’s return was vital because
Gant was pined with. foul trou-

ble most of the game. Gant only _

played 18 minutes.

“We were hoping to only play
him [Varga] for two or three
minutes, but Chris got in foul
trouble,” Willard said.

- “Certainly without him [Varga],

I don’t think we would have
won the game.”

St. John’s went into the half
leading 42-38. Pitt stayed in
contention in the second frame
with defensive pressure and
three—point shooting, and at the

10:45 mark, Alridge nailed a ’

three in transition to tie the
game at 58.

After a five-point spurt,
capped by a Maile trey, the
Panthers were in control with a
63-58 lead. The Red Storm
recaptured the lead one time
after that, but it was’ quickly
erased by Antigua’s clutch
three-pointer.

“We came in and played hard
and poured our hearts out for 40
minutes,” Maile said. “We had
to play good defense, which we
didn’t do in the first half, so
coach told us we had to step up
and we did. We came up with
some key plays down the

_ however, was how Antigua

kept his poise the previous
night against St. John’s.
Down two with 2:10
remaining, the Red Storm
seemed to have squashed
Pitt’s momentum and were
preventing the Panthers from
getting any good looks at the
hoop. Antigua, who was an
icy 0-for-8 to that point, was

the only man St. John’s was

giving a decent shot. Antigua
drained the three—pointer, and
Pitt never looked back.
Antigua transformed what
could have been a disastrous
end to the season and his
career into a huge turning
point in the game.

Alridge, who has played fairly
solidly all season after being
thrust into a leadership role,
had 19 points against St.
John’s in Pitt’s first-round
tournament game. Turnovers
have been Alridge’s weak
point this season, but he only
committed one despite play-
ing every minute of the game.
Alridge’s production slipped
to 13 points against UConn,
but his ball-handling was cru-
cial to Pitt’s contention for the
entire 40 minutes he played.
Another New York City
native, center Jaime Peterson,
maintained his role as the
Panthers’ stand-out workhorse
this season. Peterson, who
was named to the All—Big East

nament, collected 26 points in
the tourney while leading Pitt
in rebounds. He had more
than twice as many boards as
any UConn player in Friday’s
game. .

At the risk of overdoing the
“Home Sweet Home” cliché,
you could even say that there
was more electricity going for
the Panthers in the Garden
than in most of their
Pittsburgh games this year. Of
course, there were more peo-
ple rooting against Pitt than
for them in every game they
played in New York.
However, where else will you
see a crowd of people waiting
to greet Antigua and Peterson
when they come out of the
locker room or a line of kids
asking for‘Jerry McCullough’s
autograph? You will find none
of this in Pittsburgh.

Ralph Wi1lard’s biggest task
in the upcoming years will be
to bring that kind of excite-
ment to Pittsburgh.
