Pitt sophomore Rose Kalgren
and senior Yanni Hronas bobbed
in the deepend of the Trees Hall
pool, -waiting patiently for inter-
mediate swimming class to end.
Four minutes left.

The rest of the class had al-
ready quit treading — the ﬁnal

exercise of the day —— and hung, -

nearly silent, on the side.
“Trickle—down economics is
the only plan that’s ever worked
in this country,” said Hronas, his
right arm coming out of the water

to emphasize his point.

“But the wealthy can afford
a few thousand more in taxes
that are going to be cut from the

middle class,”-said Kalgren. “They
need thatiextra money so much
more.”

The discussion escalated, but
only a bit. It’s hard to carry on a
full economic debate while tread-
ing water. _

“All right, enough with the pol-
itics,” said junior Julia Axberg. But
her sentiment was in the minority
here — the other student swim-
mers simply listened intently.

\X/ith the presidential election
ﬁnally -here, the tension and un-
certainty of the future is spark-
ing conversations all over campus

and the country among the young
voters of America —— even in the
deep end.

Since 2004, more than 9 mil-

to vote for the first time, accord-

This year will be a historic year
not only for the person who wins
the presidency, but also for the
youth culture that helped choose
that president.

“It’s the coolest election we’ve
ever faced,” said Jana Stec, a se-
nior and member of Pitt’s College
Democrats. “The 2004 election

\X/hile voters gear up to cast their
ballots today, thousands of stu-
dents, volunteers and workers from
the Allegheny region will finally put
all their hard work on display.

On Sunday roughly 4,510 new
iVotronic Voting systems were
placed in precincts across the coun-
ty with around 6,600 paid volun-
teers working diligently to account
for voters’ ballots.

“We’ve been busy these past few
months  incredibly busy,” said
Mark Wolosik, Allegheny County
Elections Division manager.

Wolosik, a Pittialurrmus and for-
mer psychology major, has worked
every major election since the
1970s V ’

The Allegheny County Elections
Division covers every aspect of the
voting process from voter registra-
tion and voting machine prepara-
tion to  place- selection and

' absentee ballot recognition.

According to \Volosik, the new vot-
ing machines have been extensively

  Pitt Decides ‘O8 Timeline

tested.

Election Systems & Software
Inc., the world’s largest supplier of
total election administration solu-
tions, produced the touch—screen
iVotronic voting system in response
to the terms of the 2002 Help
America Vote Act.

The portable iVotronic allows
for paperless voting that prohib-
its multiple votes and- undervotes,
in which the voter doesn’t select

‘enough candidates for their ballot

to be counted.

' It is also outﬁtted with multiple
languages and an audio ballot ﬁanc-
tion for voters with visual impair-
ments. . - _

“Equipment began being deliv-
er_ed a week before Election Day
and will be ready on Monday [Nov.

3]. The actual setup on Tuesday will_

be done by polling place officials,”
said Wblosik.

For students, the closest iVot-
ronic-equipped voting facilities to
campus will be at Soldiers & Sailors
Memorial and Posvar Hall, iden-
tiﬁed on .voter cards as “Forbes
Quad.” .

Soldiers & Sailors will beiopen for
normal visitation ﬂee of charge to
guests on Tuesday. Back hallways of
the building will be used, and eight
polling machines will be available
to registered voters. Like all polling
places, the building will be open to
voters from 7 am. to 8 p.m.

“\X/e’re expecting a good turnout
on Tuesday,” said Amber Gehring,
an employee at Soldiers & Sailors.

College organizations ready to
vote-

On campus, politically oriented
organizations have been gearing up
for Tuesday’s arrival for months.

“The College Republicans have
been doing a lot of phone banking,
door—knocking and any tasks neces-
sary at the local campaign offices,”
said College Republicans president
Pat Graham. _

“I know there have been certain

I individuals in our organization put-

ting in nearly 10 hours a week help-
ing out with local campaigns,” said
Graham. ‘We have had probably a
 of 15 individuals putting

. Oakland ready for Election Day

in at least a few hours a week this
semester.”

Pitt’s College Democrats have
also been working to prepare for
Election Day.

“We had a big voter drive at the
beginning of the semester. Now,
we’ve been focusing on ‘Get out
the Vote,’ trying to educate students
both about Obama and also about
local candidates for state legislature
and Congressional races,” said Col-
lege Democrats president Lissa
Geiger. '

“\We’ve_ also educated college
students about everything concern-
ing voting: how, when, and where to
vote, what you need to bring with
you, what to expect with waiting
times  everything,” said Geiger.

Students should expect to see
both parties tabling all over campus
today, reminding tl:1em' to go out
and vote. ,

Both groups said they hope that
their efforts could help reduce wait
times, or at least make’ them more
pleasurable and ensure that every

But state politicians insist that

Fear not, Pittsburgh fans. Col-

lege Republicans president Pat
. Graham still rooted for the Steelers

yesterday evening.

He said he would not root
against Pittsburgh’s hometown he-
roes, despite the theory that says the
incumbent party will win the presi-
dential election if the Redskins win
their game prior to the election.

An avid interest in football is
merely one of the many  the
constantly busy Graham has on

his plate. In between a class and

instructing a recitation for applied
college algebra yesterday, Graham
spent a small amount of downtime
at Panera. Bread. S

It was a rare moment;

“There’s never a time where I
have an hour with nothing to do,”
said Graham, a member of three
different clubs and a teaching assis-
tant for two mathematics courses.
“I always have something to do.”

“It’s tough. Sometimes I feel I
stretch myself too thin. I was reluc-
tant to run for president again, and
everyone I talked to encouraged
me. It’s tough to take care of ev-

erything, tough to’ balance it all. It
takes a lot of sacriﬁcing sleep.”

Sporting a McCain/Palin ’O8
shirt from the Pittsburgh Stop out-
side vendor, Graham grinned from
across the table.

From the moment he gets up
until falling asleep at 1 or 2 a.m.,
Graham spends his day studying
for and attending classes, replying

~ to e-mails from campaign coordi-

nators and students and attending
club meetings. _ V

“Around 10 or 11 [p.m.], I study
and do homewor ” said Graham.
After pausing to take a deep breath,
he added, “I sleep a lot on the
weekends.”

Now - a junior with a double
major in actuarial mathematics and
economics and statistics, Graham
ﬁrst got involved with the College
Republicans when he was a fresh-
man. .As a sophomore, he was cho-
sen to be the group’s president.

He is also the scholarship chair
for his fraternity, Phi Delta Theta,
and the business manager for the

I Actuarial Club.
Amid his blushing after calling '

himself a nerd, Graham described
his passion for mathematics.
He said he feels the same excite-

The Pitt News 0 vvvvw.pittnews.com

ment for math that any non-math
nerd feels when they complete a
Sudoku.

One of his favorite professors,
calculus instructor Chris Lennard,
was able to bring that out in him.

“He was the ﬁrst professor I
ever, ever ha ,” said Graham. “He

was just a real goofy guy. He had a A

real passion for what he was doing
and described equations ‘by run-
ning around the classroom, doing
goofy  and throwing chalk at
the chalkboard.”

Graham’s mind quickly turns
back to today’s election:

He will help coordinate people
to work the polls, though he will
not be working them himself. He
has ‘a test in his introduction to ﬁlm
course, and ‘then he is going home
to be with his family in the South

As the youngest of three broth- '

ers, Graham said he loves spending
time with his family. One of his
favorite memories is going to the
beach with them.

“We had this one vacation spot

that was just a farm my dad’s friend

had. I loved  around in the
corn ﬁelds with my brothers and
shooting bows and arrows at tar-

Youth pulled to polls by personal ties to issues

were responding to the Vietnam
War, said Heather Smith, execu-
tive director of Rock the Vote, a
nonpartisan group that advocates
political engagement for young
adults.

Voting is Cool 

For young people in America
this year, voting, much like Chuck
Norris or ’80s pop music, is cool
again.

“There are a couple factors
that have changed voting from be-
ing a taboo subject among young
people,” said Smith.

“New technology —— Face-
book and social networking sites,

mobile phones —— give young
people the ability to be way more

What we're seeing is a perfect

ing engaged on their own and

connected to each other, allowing
this huge political conversation to

take place.” '

This is the first presidential
election when candidates have ap-
pealed so directly to young voters,
marking territory where young
Americans come together: the
Internet. Democratic presidential
candidate Sen. Barack Obama’s
Facebook page, for example,
boasts more than 2.3 million sup-
porters; more than 600,000 sup-
port Republican candidate Sen.
John McCain.

“It’s the advent of technol-
ogy — of YouTube, all the news
outlets online. The easy access we
have to knowing our rights, that’s
been a big help,” said Liz Rincon,

DECISIO'N FO.R DARFUR

the Pennsylvania state director of
the League of Young Voters, an-
other nonpartisan voter education
group.

The push for young people to
vote, however, is twofold. There
is both the push from the past —-
the desire to break out from the
shadow of the past eight years
—— and the pull from the future ——
the excitement generated by both
Obama and McCain promising a
better tomorrow.

Whatever the motivation, the
enthusiasm is getting young peo-
ple talking about more than the
latest episode of “The Hills.”

A recent Rock the Vote poll

showed that 92 percent of young
people are talking to their friends
about the election.

“Students are voting because
of the issues they care about,
[with] college affordability being
of top concern,” said Erica \X/il-
liams of the National Education
Association’s Campus Progress
Action.

‘‘\What we’re seeing is a perfect
storm — its young people being
engaged on their own and candi-
dates seeing that and sending mes-
sages out directly to them,” she
said.

“These issues are personal,”
said Smith. “This generation grew

Election Training Day

In the East Liberty office of
Allegheny County’s League of
Young Voters, the mood was tense
on Saturday. Stacks of papers,
pamphlets, bags and T-shirts laid
on the floor next to the half-dozen
Volunteers assembling them.

The walls were plastered with
mottos, posters, charts and maps.
The voices were quiet. Everyone’s
focus was on the task at hand -
to get the young voters, who have
registered online, on paper and on
the street, to the polls.

The League, dedicated to tar-
geting young and disenfranchised
voters, has worked for months
in preparation for a 13-hour slot
when the polls are open in Penn-
sylvania today.

Liz Rincon stood at the head
of a table where three volunteers
had come to be trained for Elec-
tion Day.

“Usually we start at 4 a.m., but

cc

These issues aren't going
to be solved tomorrow.
It's not like 'OK, we

Reddy

since we have so many groups
helping, you guys are lucky,” she
said. “We’re starting at 6!”

The League’s volunteers will
spend Election Day on the streets,
knocking on doors, hanging re-
minders and — if needed — pro-
viding rides for voters without
transportation. She willido what-
ever it takes to get the youth to
vote, she said.

ere to stay no matter outcome

“I have a ton of interns, but
no children. So I don’t know what
labor pains feel like, but this, this
is the ﬁnal push,” she said of her
Election Day efforts.

“It’s when you won’t even re-
member how hard you worked.
When you see how many people
turned out to vote, all the work, all
the stress won’t even matter.”

The volunteers filed out and
Rincon took a seat, exhausted
but exhilarated. She was hesitant
to feel too accomplished yet, and
the stress won’t leave until 8:01 to-
night, when the polls have closed.

“Being excited and being in-
formed,” she said, “are different
than actually turning out to vote.”

Finally, doing A brings B

To those a bit farther removed
from the actual voting process,
though, there’s no ﬁlter on the ex-
citement, and there is the feeling
that voting is not only a right, but
a way to be a part of one of the
most inﬂuential chapters in Amer-
ican history.

“Working in the past few elec-

tions, it was difficult to get people
to stop and talk to me,” said Me-
gan Hite of the union AFL—CIO’s
Student Voting Rights Protection
Program. “With this election cy-
cle, I’ll be walking down the street
and people are following me.”

To many students, this infor-
mation—hungry attitude is neces-
sary for an informed vote.

“Finally, people are actually
realizing that if you vote, there
will be a change. If you do ‘A,’ ‘B’
will happen,” said Pitt senior Alka
Singh. “Voting isn’t even just cool,
it’s a necessity to be in the know. If
you’re not, it’s like, ‘What’s wrong
with you?’”

In the end, though, one candi-
date will win and some will lose,
but both could feasibly damage
the young voter energy.

If Obama wins, for example,
will his youth sgpporters still feel
the need to push politics passion-
ately? And if McCain wins, will
Obarna’s base simply give up?

“Whatever the outcome to-
morrow, [young voters] are going

Reddy of Campus Progress Ac-
tion, another group that supports
youth political advocacy.

“These issues aren’t going to
be solved tomorrow. It’s not like
‘OK, we elected him, problem
solved.’ The youth has been em-
powered, and they’ll continue this
movement.”

In that way, for young voters
across the country, the concept of
the youth vote transcends the can-
didates, the issues and politics as a
whole.

The youth vote of 2008 is
a movement, a cultural change.
Young people in America, shown
by record numbers of registered
voters and the undeniable fervor
pulsing through campuses like
Pitt, want to be informed.

They want to have a say in the
leadership of the country.

“It’s about being a part of this
historic moment,” said Smith. “It’s
the fact that on Nov. 4, millions of
young people are going to come
together and really make a state-

ment. They’re going to take back ’

their futures.”

conducting a study on how alco-
hol on college campuses leads to
sexual abuse.

“We need to make sure they

-understand the implications,”

said Morganelli.

But those aren’t his only
goals.

“My focus would be on vio-
lent crime in citiesand cracking
down on gangsin Pennsylvania,”
said Morganelli.

Tom Corbett, the current state
attorney general and Republican
candidate for the position, plans
to go after child predators, el-
derly abuse, public corruption
and drug gangs, according to his
campaign manager, Brian Nutt.

Nutt said Corbett is a strong
candidate for the position be-
cause he has the experience that
is necessary, and “one’s experi-
ence is one of the first things
voters should take into ac-

‘ count”

Parties vie for cash control

Voters will also select an au-
ditor general, who monitors the
ways the state government‘ uses
its money.

Republican Chet Beiler, Lib-
ertarian Betsy Summers and
Democrat Jack Wagner are run-
ning for the ofﬁce.

Beiler, at Lancaster County,
Pa., businessman, says on his
Web site that he believes he
would be a good auditor gen-
eral because he is not “a career
politician” and thus has a fresh
perspective.

Summers would, according

Three people". are running
for the ofﬁce of state treasurer:
Republican candidate Tom El-

Ellis said voters should 100
for a candidate with “a steady
hand.” They should be ﬁscally
cautious, he said in an e-mail.

Ellis says on his Web site
that he typically Votes to reduce

Etzel, according to Smart-

and work more stringently to
control pension funds.

McCord says on his Web site
that he will, among other things,
work to increase jobs in Penn-
sylvania by working with invest-
ment managers to promote ur-
ban development.

He says he will also work to
promote alternative energy and
conservation.

Neither Etzel nor McCord
responded to phone calls.

Incumbent vs. Pitt professor

Voters will also select their
U.S. representatives today. Dem-
ocratic candidate Mike Doyle
and Green Party candidate and
Pitt professor Titus North are
battling to represent the 14th
Congressional District, which
includes Pittsburgh.

Doyle says on his campaign’s
Web site that he will work to stop
gas price gauging and to pass

. policies that will make America

energy-independent.

He also says he will work to
withdraw troops from Iraq and
to modernize the GI Bill.

North said his platform fo-
cuses on ﬁnding ways to con-
serve energy and to make it

    
  
  

more efﬁcient. He said he would

also work to end U.S. military in-

volvement abroad and to make
college more affordable for low-
and rniddle-income families.

“As a Green [Party candi-
date], I support free university
education for all qualiﬁed stu-
dents, which is the case in many
foreign countries,” said North in
an e-mail.

North said that as a third
party candidate, he’s in a tough
position, but he’s conﬁdent his
message will reach through to
voters.

“I want to show how much
can be accomplished with little
money but a sincere message,”
said North.

North said it’s important for
people to vote because the na-
tion currently faces a plethora
of problems. But voters, he said,
must be realistic about what
their candidates can accomplish.

“VVhile every election is im-
portant,” said North, “our coun-

, try’s problems are so severe that

there is no way a single election
can fix them. We have reached a
state of almost constant war and
are rapidly losing our Constitu-
tional liberties.”

The referendum

Voters will also vote on a ref-

erendum today. They will decide
whether they support the water
and sewer bond improvement
act, ofﬁcially known as Act 64.
The project, which costs $400
million, would upgrade water

and sewer systems.‘

Tonight, Graham will attend
the election party for U.S.  Tim
Murphy, R-Pa.

No matter the outcome of the
presidential election, Graham said
he is  to be optimistic before
he is critical, even if Democratic
candidate Sen. Barack Obama
wins.

“I’m the type of person who
wants to give the new president
a chance, to wait and see what he
does and how,” he said.

While he endorses Sen. John”

McCain, Graham said he thinks
Obama has good intentions. To
Graham, Democrats and Repub-
licans are not as different as many
people seem to think.

“Democrats and Republicans
want the same  and have the
same goals,” he said. “We just have
different opinions on how to get
them.”

Before leaving for his recita-
tion, Graham put just one more
idea on the table. He said he’d like
to run for ofﬁce one day and that
he believed his experiences in the

’ Don't lose your voice: Get out and vote today

After almost two years of_

tireless campaigning," countless
speeches, television appearances
and visits abroad and throughout
the United States, Sen. Barack
Obama and Sen. John McCain
have made it to Election Day.
The 2008 presidential campaign
has ﬁnally and thankfully come

to a close. Today is the fateful day .

thatwill reveal the next president
of the United States.

But this will happen only with
your help.

In a democratic country like
the United States, it is easy for
citizens to take for granted their

right to vote. But the right to vote '

is the very foundation of our de-

EDITORIAL

It's judgment day

mocracy.
Nevertheless, only 64 percent

' of U.S. citizens aged 18 and older

voted in the last presidential elec-
tion, according to. the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau. \Y/hile this number is
a four-percent increase from the
2000 presidential election, it is
still decidedly low. Out of those
registered to vote in the 2004
presidential election, 89 percent
said they voted. This year, that
percentage should be 100,

The polls have been predict-
ing the winner of the election for
months, leading many voters to
think their particular candidate
has the presidency in the bag
and that one person’s vote will _

not make much of a difference.
But this is a mistake voters can-
not make. Recall the 2000 presi-
dential election, when George W
Bush won the state of Florida
by merely hundreds of votes. Al
Gore won the popular vote by
less than. 1 percent and Bush won
the electoral vote by less than 1
percent. The election was one of
the closest races in American his-
tory, and every vote mattered.

In Pennsylvania especially,
your vote is critical. Pennsylvania
has been a crucial battleground
these past few months. As a
swing state holding 21 electoral
votes, Pennsylvania could deter-
mine who ultimately wins the

presidency.

But the office of the presiden-
cy is not the only one at stake in
this election. Voters will cast their
ballots for congressional ‘candi-
dates, potentially giving one party
more power than the other.

Votes will also cast ballots for
state and local candidates such as
governors and county commis-

‘ sioners. —

So, today, make sure to take
time to head to the polls and

vote. Whether you’re busy work-

ing or overwhelmed with classes,
whether you have outstanding
parking tickets‘ or other traf-
fic violations, whether you have
overdue bills or county ﬁnes,'be

\.,.,"«-

aware that you still have the right 

t0 VOtC.

In Pennsylvania, polls open 
at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m., 
so voters should arrive early to j

avoid long lines. And if you can- ?

not make it early, don’t let the ;

long lines overwhelm you. Stand 3

in line for as long as it takes. If 
you arrive on time, election ofﬁ-

 Local comics tap politic

by Katie Blemler
Staﬂ Writer

Election Day means an end to
the incessant political ads plagu-
ing commercial - breaks of “The
Ofﬁce” and “CS1.” W/hew. But it
also means the culmination of‘ re-

 , cent. politically fuelled comedies

Colleen Garvin I Staff Photographer

Pittsburgh comedian Tim Dimond casts his vote for Easiest Candidate to Mock yesterday. Today he'll .

vote for real.

 

— now hotter than ever —-'— cov-
ering every television and com-
puter screen in America.

Popular satires like “The Daily
Show,” “The Colbert Report”
and “San1tday Night} Live” hit

comedic  20(i)m8*s ‘Candi-* i_

dates. Although token politicians

‘ seem to be following a “bridge to

nowhere,” comedians. certainly
are not —— they’ve done well with

al funny bone

musical parodies and original co-
medic songs. i '
“Recently, I’ve placed the
guitar on_ sabbatical and taken
to the more traditional spoken
word form,” said Dimond. And
in these verbal routines, he has
found a timely focus in politics.
“As long as you have a govern-
ment creating undue stress, you’re_
going to need a way to relieve it,”
he said. “Comedy allows me an
outlet for my pent-up rage with-

, _out actually having to do anything

of ‘substance.’ I can be an argu-
mentative prick on the sidelines
while politicians go in and muck
things up some more.”

. Dimond’s attitude is mirrored

the candidates’
quirky manner—   «
isms and distinct
idiom.

And it’s not
just the national
comedic ﬁgures
who have uti-
lized the election.
Local comedians

Candidates as Celebrities not a good government model

by Tom VanBuren
Senior Staﬂ Writer

   

Last week, Sen. Barack Obama
appeared in an infomercial di-

‘rected by an Academy Award-

winning filmmaker. John McCain
countered by appearing on “Sat-
urday Night Live.” The two-year
war for the presidency will end
tonight, and_Hollywood has been

~ a more signiﬁcant battleground

than ever before. v
The power of Hollywood in

._ an election season ‘has steadily

grown since the ﬁrst Kennedy-
Nixon debate.

Richard Nixon,‘ who ,was ill
and refused to wear makeup, ap-
peared sickly and unkempt next

,_to his young, prettied-up oppo-
nent in the 1960 televised debate. «

It was a turning point in the his-
tory of presidential races — can-
didates ever since have needed to
consider the consequences of ap-
pearing on ﬁlm. .

Of course, public ﬁgures had

been caught by cameras before
but never broadcasted to such
a wide audience so quickly. And
with the technology boom of
the past 20 years, Americans are
spoiled by the immediate avail-
ability of information.

The candidates have come a_

long way since Nixon, and they

' know that appearance is every-

where and everything. In the ﬁght
to become one of the world’s
biggest celebrities, star power
is a bigger inﬂuence than ever

before. Obama is credited with
having a‘_ strong handle on the
movement —— his channel is the
most-watched on YouTube. Look
at photos,or videos from his cam-
paign, and see a conﬁdence _that
comes from knowing just where
the cameras are and when they’re
rolling. 4 ,

McCain’s mobilization as a ce-

lebrity is less consistent. Not only-

does he sometimes seem unsure
of how to act on camera -— see
his awkward wandering dur-

_ ing the second debate  but he

has also made the grave error of
spurning Hollywood.‘ When he

A cancelled an appearance on “Da-

vid Letterman” at the last minute,
he returned weeks later to ﬁnd
the host in attack mode, grilling
him about his ‘campaigns focus
on Obama’s connection to Wil-
liam Ayers.

Hell hath no fury like a talk
show host scorned. A

weeks ago, but the show owes most thanks

Tina Fey, whose impec- M

“It’s a combination of
two things: One, the po-
litical climate is so rich of
material that making fun
of it is so easy, and two,
Tina Fey is brilliant,” said
Dirnond.

“I think that these newest attack ads are
getting a little bit absurd,” said comedian
Bill Crawford, a Pittsburgh native. .

“The McCain campaign is now play-
ing ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon’ with
Obama,” said Crawford. “The ad will say
something like ‘Obama pals around with
Bill Ayers, who is a fan of Hugo Chavez,
who is a friend of Fidel Castro, who started
the Cuban Revolution, which [led to] our

routine.

“I think it’s pretty clear
that Kevin Bacon is a
threat to our national se-
curity, and as long as he
is still out there making
movies, none of us will be
  safe at home or abroad,”
  he concluded with a re-
freshing air of sarcasm.

Crawford is currently a 
stand—up comedian who began in improvi- j

pic, where Chris Farley and Mike Myers got i» in

their starts. And like Dirnond, he believes  
that comedy is an essential outlet in getting 

out political news.

C “In serious times, people gravitate to-

like ‘The Daily Show’ or ‘Bill Maher’ or
‘SNL’ or ‘Letterman’ — they are all experi-

- «fencing heightened viewership. I think that
is a testament to the fact that people trust
comedians to tell the truth.”

And it doesn’t hurt that the truth view-
ers appreciate is enhanced with sardonic
undertones.

 “We are involved with two wars that
aren’t going well. Do you really think a
72-year-old POW is a good idea?” joked
Crawford. “I mean, that is kind of like
putting someone who got busted on that
show ‘How to Catch a Predator’ in charge

‘ Comics see br

of a day-care. That is just a set-up for fail-
ure.”

The appeal of comedic approaches to
the news is that comedians have the ability to
mix mockerywith seriousness when needed.

“This year you can really sense the his-
tory of it all,” said Crawford in a more
serious tone. “There have been so many
barriers broken with respect to race and
gender, and I think it has raised the level
of consciousness in the country and ener-
gized young people like I have never seen

ighter side of politics

before.”

Susannah Perlman, a New York co-
median originally from Pittsburgh,
touched upon the issues of race and
gender as well when discussing elec-
tion aspects she has focused on.

“I tried to inspire my audiences to de-
mand a Clinton/Obarna ticket because
not only would it be exciting,” she said, “it
would also bring the women and the black
people together. And that’s mean hair
weaves for everybody.”

November 4, 2008

Perlman recently hosted a per-
formance by The Obama Girls of
Comedy at Pittsburgh’s own com-
edy club, Slapsticksl Comedy Loft.

“‘The Daily Show’ and ‘The Colbert
Report’ have been the saving graces of so
many for the past eight years. That’s where
I and many get our news,” she said.

“If I am watching the news and not
laughing,_ there is something seriously
wrong. Comedy is truth, and that’s what
many of us need right now.”

the candidates can’t only be themselves --
they have to pretend to be themselves.

Just like Stephen Colbert plays a fake
version of himself on his punditry—spoof-
ing “The Colbert Report,” candidates have
entered a bizarre un—reality of self—aware
comedy.

It was almost allegorical last Halloween
when Obama appeared on “SNL” wearing
a costume of himself. 2

Last Saturday, “Sarah Palin” (as played
by Tina Fey) suggested that if she doesn’t
run in 2012, she could be a “white Oprah.”
Is that really so hard to imagine?

With the line so blurry between Palin
and Tina Fey’s version of her, the VP nom-
inee is almost a mythic pop culture creation
— an Alaskan bogeywoman, ﬁst-ﬁghting a
moose in the community hockey rink park-
ing lot. Her personality and mannerisms are
approaching the point of meta-humor -—
she’s disappeared into her Wal-Mart mom
persona, and like Joe (the Plumber) and Joe
(Six—Pack), she’s now more of an idea than
anything else. ‘

When you go Hollywood as a candidate,
you walk a fine line. You have to be easily
categorized but not derivative, self—depre-
cating but not self-parodying. Because after
today, one person is going to be sentenced
to at least four years in that spotlight, and
it’s going to shine even brighter than it has
up to this point.

Whoever it is has to regain some sem-
blance of self, lest we have a president who
is nothing more than a caricature of an old
man, or a hockey mom or a rock star.

Even Kennedy had to take off his make-
up eventually.
