three times in his ﬁrst weekend as a
Pitt student.
His 129 yards on 20 attempts and

two rushing touchdowns —his third
was a reception — Saturday was just
what the Panthers needed, after los-
ingLeSean McCoytothe NFLoverthe
summer.

The 5-foot—8 starting Pitt football
running back helped propel the Pan-
thers to a 38-3 season-opening throb-
bing of Youngstown State University
and turned heads inthe process.

“I thought [Lewis] made a lot of
plays,” Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt
said.

I-Iighlighting a four—play, 41—yard
drive early in the ﬁrst quarter, which
put the Panthers up 7-0, was Lewis’
shake-and-bake clinic as he froze a
Youngstown State Penguin for a 16-
yard_ touchdown run after turning the
outside comer.

Credit Card Act restrictscompanies’ practices

New act will make it more
diﬂicult for young people to
acquire credit cards

by Michael Macagnone
‘ Staff Writer

A&E and News

 

The Turkish Cultural Center
invites Pitt to dinner.

No more free T-shirts  at least not
from credit "card companies. That’s
because the Credit Card Act of 2009
prohibits this and other strategies
used to get college students to sign
up for credit cards. The act, which
will go into full effect in February, will
also make it harder for people young-
er than 21 to get a credit card.

“The law is a very ﬁmdamental
overhaul of the entire industry,”
said Peter Garuccio, a spokesman
for the American Bankers’ Associa-
tion, which oversees the credit card
industry.

“It’s difﬁcult to guess what is go-
ing to happen in the industry once
this goes into effect.”

iiurder By Death

The Pitt News chats one on one with Murder By Death’s Adam Turla.

Some parts of the act are already
being enforced, including a portion
stating that companies must mail
credit card bills no later than 21 days
before they’re due.

The law bans credit card com-
panies from offering “any tangible
item” — including hats and T-shirts
— in exchange for a signature on a

Students fast during Ramadan to renew faith

Muslim students forego food, drink and sex in hope of spiritual catharsis

Halyse Domencic
Staﬂ" Writer

Huseyin Ucarwon’t eat pizzainthe Wil-
liam Pitt Union’s Schenley Cafe or the
fried chicken in the Cathedral Cafe, at
least not between sunrise and sunset.
Ucar, a graduate student in the engi-
neering school, is a practicing Muslim

and is thus celebrating the month of
Ramadan until Sept. 20.

During the ninth month of the Is-
lamic calendar, Mus1imsfastbyrefrain—

The Quran, the Islamic holy book,

said. “When you eat in this time, you

Community joins

for I ftar dinners

Ramadan 4 2

dinners each day.

Duringthe meal, the organizations
playtraditional Muslim prayer musicas.
they serve lines of fastjngparticipants.
The awaiting tables are equipped with
cups, bowls, bread, soda and water.

Outside of the tent Saturday, Reyyan
Yeniterzi waited patiently at the end
of the line.

A CMU student pursuing a doctor-
ateincomputer science, she said itwas
herﬁrsttimeinthe United States during
Ramadan.

“These events are important. We
can’t eat during the day, and through
thiswe learn aboutpat1'ence,”Yeniterzi
said. ‘

Many ofthe challenges ofRamadan
occur duringﬁastinghours, as Muslims
also cannot drink water.

“Being thirsty challenges us more
t:hanbeinghung1y,”Demirsaid. “August
isawarm monthand days arelonger—
that makes italittle bit difficult to cope

with.”Ramadan began Aug. 22.

Fastjngmakesup alaige portion of
Ramadan,butMuslims also performa
number of othertasks.

“Ramadan is a month of spiritual
deepening and tranquility,” Demir
said.

Whilecarryingacross, Muslims re-
cite each chapter of the Quran, which
adds up to 30 chapters for the month.
In the evening, they also say a prayer
called Teravih.

“That prayer lasts for about two
hours. Body gets alittle bit tired, but
spiritisfedbythe lightemanatingﬁpm
the Quran,” Demir said.

Duringthesetimes, Muslimsﬁnd it
importantto cometogether, according
to Ucar, who said he tries to attend the
Ramadan dinners every night.

“It’s a good place,” he said. “We
collect in a community, share each
other’s feelings, and those are all good
things.”

Bad economy hurts credit approval

Dependants younger than 21 require a co—signer

plications.”

But the law’s new restrictions
don’t stop there.

One portion of it laid out new reg-
ulations foryoung consumers, saying
that people 20 and youngerwill have
to either have someone older than 21
co—sign their cards or provide proof
of “independent means,” basically
show that they can pay off a credit
card balance in full on their own.

The Federal Reserve will deter-
mine what constitutes the “indepen-
dent means” required to apply for a
credit card, Garuccio said.

It will determine a number of
other rules that govern credit under
this law as well.

When the act goes into effect, ap-
plying for a credit card will take much
more time than previously, said Bill
Hazelton, managing director and

_ co—founder of Creditcardassist.com,

which helps people compare differ-
ent cards. l

Hazelton said, “Getting parents
as co—signers alone may take days.
Getting a credit card won’t be instant
anymore.”

“It will be much more difficult
for credit-worthy customers to gain
access to credit,” he added. “That’s
a big negative. It’s like throwing the
baby out with the bathwater.”

Still, he said, “This is long over-
due. The culture of the country need-
ed a stopgap measure from where it
was going.”

He added that this act, along with

the bad economy will make it much

more difficult’ for people younger
than 21 to be approved for even in-
troductory cards.

Garuccio said, “A lot of banks
even now won’t issue a card to a
young person without a co-signer

anyway.”

In light of the act, Discover is
stepping up its efforts to educate stu-
dents about debt management, said
one of the company’s spokeswomen,
Mai Lee Ua. The student loans area
of the Discoverwebsite has features
such as a ﬁnancial terms glossary and
a series of “Borrow Smart” videos.

Some students thought the ban
of gifts in return for credit cards was
a good move.

Katelyn Annett, a junior majoring
in social work, said, “We should be
smart enough to not be tricked by a
T—shirt, but that’s not always true.”

Annett has two credit cards, both
co—signed by her parents.

“I don’t think it’s a bad idea to
make people prove that they can pay
off the credit cards,” she said.

The Student Monitor survey of
2008, which tracks how students
use ﬁnancial services, found that
4 percent of students applied for a
credit card at an on-campus display
or company event, and 6 percent
including of campus events, where
gifts were most commonly distrib-
uted.

Editorial

Partisan politics
hinder Obama’s
student address

It wasn’t supposed to be like this:
the controversy, the questioning

' and the roars of discontent from

parents.

Today at noon Eastern Stan-
dard Time, President Obama will
deliver a televised live speech to
K-12 students across the United
States to address the importance
of staying in school and study-
ing hard.

He’s also added a few sug-
gested student lesson plans for
the teachers. Unfortunately,
however, all the debate over his
speech hinders any real educa-
tional benefit it might provide.

The White House insists
Obama’s speech intends to re-
inforce the importance of aca-
demics. According to an article
on CNN.com, some parents and
teachers are still skeptical. They
insist the address will inject a
partisan political agenda on
young students.

Some view the address as
uninvited and disruptive to the
school day and question why
it wasn’t released over a more
voluntary medium such as You-
Tube.

The decision whether to show
the speechhas, in some cases,
been left to individual school dis-
tricts or superintendents. Other
schools are allowing principals
and individual teachers to de-
cide.

Regardless, most schools are
allowing parents to opt out their
children if they disagree with the
viewing. Some parents will even
keep their children home for the
day.

Concerning all the contro-
versy, this matter is a textbook
case of heated partisanship dis-
agreement that both blurs and
undermines the issue at hand. '

White House officials prob-
ably believed this event would
provide a chance for Obama to

offer a few words of encourage-
ment to students — they didn’t
foresee such widespread, pas-
sionate dispute.

Perhaps the response, largely
from right—wing America, is over-
blown.

As a precaution, the White
House has alreadyreleased the
lesson plans and a transcript of
the speech to be vetted by wary
parents. And again, the White
House maintains there’ll be no
attempt to sway or impress po-
litical ideals.

Yet the onslaught of debate
overshadows the issue’s sub-
stance: Parents and schools
seem more concerned about the
potential infringement of the ad-
dress rather than its intended
message. The real concern -
students’ progression through
grade school — seems lost in the
wave of political upheaval.

It would be unfair to blame the
turmoil on conservative Ameri-
ca, because if former President
George W. Bush attempted such
an address during his later years
in oﬁice, many liberals would
have been equally opposed.

The real problem lies in forc-
ing a seemingly uncontroversial
issue into becoming a subject of
partisan contention —— a reﬂec-
tion of the aggressiveness of to-
day’s political scene.

Obama has faced intense par-
tisan challenges on the health
care debate and uncertain econ-
omy. But those are issues worthy
of such deliberation because of
the extent of their impact and
because they’re ongoing.

Although this matter shows
parents are concerned with their

Rehab no longer virtual reality

Internet rehab has made its American debut

Molly Green
Columnist

 

Somewhere, Bill Gates is crying
— his psycho-subversive plot to
control the world is ﬁnally being
thwarted. No longer will we, the
feeble-minded masses, spend our
days toiling in technological slav-
ery.

No, not when we have the other
American staple: rehab.

According to the Associated
Press, the ﬁrst U.S. residential
treatment center for Internet
addiction has opened, making
this a sad but unsurprising day
for America.

In the advent of laptops, wire-
less Internet and smart phones,
people are increasingly attached
to technology. Last weekend, my
father refused to go on a family
kayaking trip for Labor Day for fear
of getting his BlackBerry wet —
naturally, he and the handheld life-
sucker could not be separated.

Honestly, I can’t even write about
this topic objectively, as I found this
news article while browsing the In-

ternet in an effort to procrastinate
from schoolwork, job work and
other “real life” activities.

And yet, many people would not
consider excessive time spent on
the Internet as much of a problem
as, say, an alcohol or gambling ad-
diction. I

However, it is this lack of stigm
that allows unhealthy technology

behavior to thrive. While alcohol- I

 

Technology addictions are
not only accepted — they
are often supported.

ism and compulsive gambling are
certainly serious problems, they are
somewhat curbed by the fear that
society would turn its oh-so—cold
shoulder against their perpetrators
at any time.

But technology addictions are
not only accepted —— they are often
supported. The Internet is quickly

becoming a leading way to socialize
with friends, debate topics in the
news, research information and
even date. -

While beneﬁcial to an extent,
such addiction can be just as, if not
more, detrimental. For example:
We have Ben Alexander, the ﬁrst
patient to enroll in the 45-day pro-
gram, which is named reSTART.

Alexander signed up for the
center after he ﬂunked out of col-
lege because he spent every min-
ute of this day playing “World of
Warcr ,” according to the Associ-
ated Press.

This behavior, unfortunately,
is quickly becoming the norm.
According to the Pew Internet &
American Life Project, 53 percent of
all American adults play some kind
of video game — this includes vir-
tually all of the teen demographic.
73 percent regularly use the Inter-
net.

And yes, I know, such activities
are not a problem to the average
user. It becomes a greater prob-
lem when use is either excessive or
when users turn to the Internet to
escape personal problems or deal
with negative feelings — ‘a problem

On health care, time for Obama to take charge

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 
 
 

All politicians are somewhat fond of
beingvagueveryfewpoliticians want
to be as honest as George McGovern
and thereby lose elections as badly
as he did. However, there are times
when a man in oﬂice has toalead, to
write bills himselfand to be clear, lest
he lose major political points. This is
the situation President Obama ﬁnds

himselfintoday, yet attimesitappears I

heismore ooncemed about appearing
everybody’s ally than putting things
plainly ,
Health care reform is one major
area in which Obama has tried to
appear decisive yet come up some-
what short. The biggest problem? It
is unclear what “Obarna-care” actu-
ally is. There are three versions of the

bill running around out there — a V

House version, a Senate version and
a version that attempts to reconcile
the two. Yet, none of these bills were
clearly Oban1a’s, and it appears thathe

has allowed the Congress to do most

of the heavy liﬂing
In a recent article, The New York

Times outlined the president’s woes:
The compromise bill has stalled in
’ committee, and Obama is counting on
the support of Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-
Maine, and other liberal Republicans
to get the ‘darn thing passed. It looks
like the Obama administration is head-
ing for a watering downof the public
option. Speaker of the ‘House Nancy

Pelosi, D—Calif., however, has made -

it clear that a bill without the public
option will not pass the’ House.

This is all deeply problematic for
the president. First, no matter what
he does, his opponents can point to

that the president has not been espe-

Letterto the editor

To the Editor,

I am dismayed at the alarmist coverage being given to the H1N1 “pandemic” that has af-
fected members of Carnegie Mellon and, purportedly, Pitt. However, this letter requests that
The Pitt News and the University take a more collected approach to informing students.

I appreciate that Pitt and The Pitt News are keeping students abreast of the pandemic, 4
but students should read the disseminated information carefully. As stated in The Pitt News V
and Pitt’s literature-, just by practicing some basic hygiene measures, students should be

well-protected from H1N1 andother inﬂuenza viruses.

Pitt’s policy of asking affected students to take all meals in their rooms and even return
A home until the disease is gone strikes me as an overreaction.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m pleased that the computer lab workers have taken to disinfecting
computers between users and appreciate that Pitt and The Pitt News are showing concern for
the health and well-being of the students. However, for the sake of those same students, The “
Pitt News and the University _should remove the hysterical slant from H1N1 coverage.

that has grown in the recent economy.
' The Pew Internet 8: American Life Project
reports that approximately 69 percent of
Americans have used the Internet to cope
with the recession.

The opening of the Internet rehab cen-
ter is therefore an appropriate sign of the
times, and yet it’s not accessible to most in
price. The program costs $14,000 — abill
that pays for counseling and psychotherapy

In addition, patients are encouraged to
go “cold turkey” off technology and instead
spend their days doing household chores,
working on the grounds, going on outings,
exercising and baking, according to the As-

Internet rehab a pricey fix

sociated Press.

For such a prevalent problem, we must
offer more and cheaper opportunities for
those afflicted to Internet and other tech-
nology addictions.

$14,000 to do household chores and
baking? I feel as though my family or friends
could provide a similar service for free if they
just chained me to a chair in some basement
in South Oakland.

And I’m sure they could look up some

great intervention tips online.

more minutes of hers.

Even though Pitt students are no strangers to

There is a longstandingtradition amongthe
Islamic Turkish community of inviting friends
and family over for dinners to break the fast of
Ramadan. The '1urkish Cultural Center of Pitts-
burgh is taking this practice a step further by
opening its doors —— or tent - to the entire Pitt
community. ’ l

Noah: Where '5 the ‘Halo’ movie?

Tyler Perry flicks, Coheed and Cambria among latest beefs

Noah Levinson
Contributing Editor

Like an almost—past-middle—age business-
man who loudly complains to his wife after
a long day of TPS reports, today I come home
to you, my readers, with a rant that will be so
loud and unorganized that we’ll have to put
the kids to bed early and put the meatloaf in
Tupperware.

I present to you what will hopefully occur
every now and then and also help my dream of
being a title maker for pomographic ﬁlms:

“NOAH LEVINSON’S BIG OLE BEEF:”
Beef No. 1: Why isn’t there" a “Halo” movie
yet? — - I
Rupert Sanders, renowned commercial
director of some of the most entertaining 30-
second spots to hit television, released another
live-action trailerforanupcoming “Halo” video
game titled “Halo 3: ODST.” “

‘ His ﬁrst “Halo” commercial, “Believe,” was
so convincing and realistic that immediately
after its release, a ﬂood of rumors drowned
the Internet talking about an upcoming fea-
ture ﬁlm.

- At ﬁrst, South African ﬁlmmaker Neill

‘Blomkamp was ready to create the “Halo”

movie, but after ﬁve months of uncertainty,
those plans were left for dead in the middle
of the desert.

But at least Blomkamp went on to do some-
thing just as awesome. Haveyou seen “District
9” yet? Thank Blomkamp for it. Haven’t seen»
it? You should.

Regarding the current status of a movie, a
representative from Microsoft spoke to the vid-
eo game blog Kotaku in August about a “Halo”

movie and said, “We’re glad there’s still a lot ‘

of enthusiasm in the entertainment industry
surrounding the idea of a ‘Halo’ movie. That
said, the ‘Halo’ feature ﬁlm remains on hold
aswe focus on projects like ‘Halo 3: ODST’ and
‘Halo: Reach.”’

Whatever, Microsoﬁ. Right in front of you
is Mr. Sanders, _a man who has twice created
“Halo” commercials that have consistently
spun “Halo” movie hype. Let’s get this master
chef-sized ball rolling.

Beef No. 2: “Black Dynamite” is not in the-
aters yet.

“Black Dynamite,” a blaxploitation-style
ﬁlm that shined at Sundance, will come to lim-
ited theaters Oct. 16. But I want to see it now!

This movie will have more quotable quotes
than “Zoolander,” “Anchorman” and “The
Hangover” combined.

While I would love to give examples of
quotes 1 have heard so far, they are not news-
paper-appropriate. Take some initiative, go
online yourself and ﬁnd the red-band trailer
on traileraddictcom. Watch it and want it as
badly as I do.

Beef No. 3: I still can’t read Cormac Mc-
Carthy’s “The Road.”

Though I have continually tried, I cannot
read the highly praised novel about a father
and son’s post-apocalyptic ﬁght for survival.
I’ve tried reading it in the library, alone on the
couch, with music, before bed, when I wake up,
with lunch, at the park and even with an audio
book accompaniment, but there’s just no way
I' can make it through the novel. V

It’s not that I don’t like the book —— I just
can’t sit myself down to read it. So maybe I’ll
just wait until the movie version comes outwith
Viggo Mortensen in October -— alter “B1ack
Dynamite,” of course.

A ﬁm side note: Itwas ﬁlmed in Pittsburgh,
which proves a great shooting location for ﬁr-
turistic apocalyptic wastelands.

Beef No. 4: Coheed and Cambria ruined the
animated ﬁlm “9.”

I saw atrailer for aﬁlmlast week called “9.”
It’s about a bunch of sock puppet things trying
to save the world. As lame as that sounds, the

short on which the feature ﬁlm is basedis actu- ’

ally heavily praised by critics and on my list of
things to watch before I die.

So in the trailer, the ﬁrst 40 seconds are at-
tractive and creative, but then the music turns

. into something I haven’t heard since my Guitar

Hero days: “Welcome Home” by Coheed and
Cambria. . _

So instead of showcasing the beauty and
depth of what could be a fantastic flick, who-
ever made the trailer put together a montage

of cheesy action sequences accompanied by ’

trying-too—hard-to—be-epic music. Shame all
around.

Beef No. 5: Tyler Perry has another movie
coming out.

For the eighth time, Perry has taken a
dump. ‘ .

And just as with every other dump Perry
takes, he scoops it out of the toilet, gives it a
title and releases it to the public for its so-called
“entertainmen ”

Perry’s “I Can Do BadAllby Myself” iscom-
ing to theaters next week.

Now, some people might disagree and say
Perry makes good movies. That’s ﬁne. I respect
your opinion, but don’t argue with me about
it. You can go in your room and watch Perry
while I go in my room and watch something
else. Chances are, we probablyilvouldn’t make
good friends, anyway.

But one day, I do plan on watching all of
Per-ry’s ﬁlms. Based on the same logic oftasting
frog legs or going base-jumping, I just want to
try it for the experience.

But for each additional ﬁlm Perry makes,
that’s one more ﬁlm I have to add to my T‘yler
Perry-athon. And as ﬁm as it is to experience
everything, immediately below heavy drink-
ing and snifﬁng lead paint, Perry’s formulaic,
moralistic feature ﬁlms are the third—highest
cause of brain damage.

All right, I’m ﬁnished. I didn’t wake up the
kids, did 1? Maybe we can reheat the meatloaf,
if you’d like. I’m sorry, honey, I have to stop
bringing my work home with me.

Sports    
nters beat up on Yongstown State

True freshman Dion Lewis played in his ﬁrst collegiate game yesterday. He rushed for 129 ya

ﬁve minutes to score his ﬁrst
touchdown?

For Lewis, there were “no
butterﬂies” and it just “felt good
running in [the end zone].” It had
to have felt better the second and
third time he forced the panther to
growl over the PA system, but most
importantly, Lewis’ on-the-ground
performance answered a question
for the coaching staff, if it didn’t
make an outright statement.

“Some of the areas that were a
big concern for me going into the
game, I feel a little better about
right now,” Wannstedt said after
the game, referring to the team’s
running back position.

Throughout training camp,
Lewis and freshman running back
Ray Graham shared time trying to
impress coaches and solidify them-
selves as legitimate starters.

While Graham took great
strides in developing himself as
a real option on game day, it was
Lewis’ experience with the team’s
system that earned him the start-

_ ing nod and the bulk of the running

game duties.

Lewis enrolled at Pitt during
the spring semester to start early
workouts with the team. It paid

 

of.

‘‘[Lewis] had an entire spring
practice that Graham did not have,”
Warmstedt said. “He had an oppor-
tunity to jump in our program and
go through the physical training
and also the mental discipline. I
think that’s what separated he and
[Graham] .”

Familiarity with a system and
innate talent always make for an
effective running back, but per-
haps the bigger surprise Saturday
afternoon was Lewis’ tenacious
physicality.

With Pitt leading 7-3 in the sec-
ond quarter, senior quarterback
Bill Stull put the ball in Lewis’ hands
and the rest was a man-among-
boys exhibition of tough running
and breaking tackles. Lewis pen-
etrated a large hole without hesita-
tion and was poised to run in for his
second touchdown before a slew of
YSU Penguins wrapped themselves
around the running back.

Lewis feared not and instead
carried the defenders with him for
a 25-yard gain before falling just
short of the goal line. He would
pound his way in on the next
play.

“He was a very powerful player

coming in here,” Wannstedt said.
“But I think the one thing that
showed up today with [Lewis] —
you knew he was fast — but what
showed up was how strong he is.
He will break tackles.”

And so he did, it seemed, every
time he touched the ball.

Lewis found holes and hit them,
broke tackles when wrapped up
by defenders and made them miss
when he had room. But that kind
of success is a product of not only
Lewis, but of the offensive line,
too.

The freshman back acknowl-

edged a collaborative effort as a
catalyst for his individual prow-
ess.

“Our offensive line did a great
job, and they deserve all the cred-
it,” he said.

Coach Wannstedt agreed to a
great extent. '

“Our offensive line did a very
good job when we were running
the ball,” he said, but expressed
concern about the line’s pass pro-
tection effectiveness.

As for the game plan, Wannst-
edt kept things simple, as he
mentioned the team called only
about four types of running plays
throughout the entire game.

The simple and straightforward
run-ﬁrst strategy of Wannstedt and
the coaching staff was what stuck
out for Lewis when considering
schools during recruitment.

For the past few seasons, Mc-
Coy was asked to carry the team
on his back. Asked if seeing a run-
ning back shoulder that kind of
responsibility for a team helped in
the decision to come to Pitt, Lewis
acknowledged it “deﬁnitely” con-
tributed. a

At the end of the day, he thought
he “made a good decision.”

One game, three touchdowns
and more than 100 yards is always
impressive.

For Lewis?

“There’s still a lot of work to
do.”

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

After missingall but one half ofthe last
football season with a broken neck,

linebacker Adam Gunn said over the '

summer hewas anxious to get his ﬁrst
hit of the season out of the way.

He wasted little time. ,

On the ﬁrst play of the year, Gunn
and Jabaal Sheard brought down
Youngstown State running back Kevin
Smith after a 4-yard carry.

“After that ﬁrst hit, I forgotlbroke
my nec ” Gunn said. ‘

The middle linebacker Went on
to lead all Panthers with? eight total

tackles and two sacks, as the defense .

carried Pitt to a 38-3 win in its ﬁrst
game of the year Saturday. It was a
much morepleasant start to Gunn’s
season than last year.

Early in the second half of last

year’s seasonopenerGunnwascarried ~

off the ﬁeld on a backboard after col-
lidingwith teammate Scot1:McKillop.
Because ofhis neck injury, Gunn didn’t
play at all the rest of the season.

' Early in the second half of Satur-
day’s season opener, Gurm recorded a
sack of'Youngstown State quarterback
Brandon Summers. Gurm came into
the gamewith 1.5 career sacks, butthe
8-yard take—down of Summers was
already his second in the game.

It wasn’t only a wildly different
opener for Gunn, but for Pitt as well.

Last year the Panthers dropped
theirﬁrst game of the season against
Bowling Green, a game they were ex-
pected to easily win. Pitt had a 17-14
lead at the half in that game, but ended
up losing 27-17. T‘

On Saturday Pitt had a 21-3 lead
at the halfbut didn’t let Youngstown
State back into the game. The defen-
sive line kept pressure on Summers
all day tallying six sacks for a loss of
38 yards.

“'I‘hey’re the best defensive line in
the country,” Gurm said.

Dom DeCicco and Ricky Gary ‘

each picked off passes, and Pitt held

the Penguins to 159 yards of total of- ‘

fense. -

But itwasn’t only the defense that
impressed. So did freshman running
back Dion Lewis.

In his ﬁrst collegiate action, Lewis
rushed 20 times for 129 yards and two
touchdowns.

He also caught two passes for 10
yards and one touchdown;

Women’s soccer defeats Xavier, stays undefeated

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s soccer team extend-
ed its season-openingwinningstreak
to four games with a3-0 victory over
Xavier on Sunday.

The Panthers have started the sea-
son with four victories only twice in
school history, with the ﬁrst time in
2006. That year, they eventually fell
to 6-10-1 overall and 2-7-1 in the Big
East. ' .

Both teams struggled to start the
game, but Pitt found its stride in the
second half, while the Musketeers
(0-4-O) continued to struggle. The
Panthers (4-0-0) scored all three of
their goals in the second period.

“We started out pretty slow inthe

ﬁrst half, but we started out the sec— _

0nd half better and were able to get
those three goals, so thatwas goodfor
us,” Pitt coach Sue—Moy Chin said.

Pitt freshman Ashley Cuba scored
the ﬁrst goal off a corner kick in the
50th minute off assists from Rebecca
Fraser and Maura Caslin. The goal
marked Cuba’s team-leading fourth
of the season.

Klarissa Ames added another goal
for the Panthers _in the 67th minute.
Sophomore Maura Romano and ju-
nior Liz Carroll both picked up an

assist on the score.

Two minutes later, Ames returned
the favor, teaming up with Carroll to
assist Romano in scoring the ﬁnal
goal of the game. The goal was Ro-
mano’s ﬁrst of her Pitt career.

It was" a well-rounded game for
the Panthers. 1?

“I thought our forwards and wings
played well over all,” Chin said. “Ev-
eryone plays well and everyone works
hard. That really shows.”

The Panthers led Xavier 5-1 in
shots entering halfhme and the mar-
gin inthe second half. They ended the
game with a 12-3 shot margin over the
Musketeers.

 

We have a great, strong
mentality right now.

Sue-Moy Chin

Pitt ﬁnished the game with nine
shots on goal, including three from
senior Ashley Habbel, who needs
one goal to break the school’s career-
scoring record. Habbel tied the scor-
ing record with a goal in Pitt’s victory
over Kent State.

Xavier’s Carly Wenzel and Brittany
Green produced the two shots on goal
for the Musketeers.

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart

shut out the opposition for the third
time this season, registering two
saves on the game.

With an undefeated record, the
Panthers said they are happy where
they stand.

“We are off to a great start. We
have a great, strong mentality right
now,” Chin said. “We are approach-
ingeach game playingto win. Thatis
important, and it’s going to carry on
throughout the rest of the season as

’ we approach Big East play.”

Chin said her team has grown dur-
ing its fast start this season and that
she continues to see progress carry
over from practice to the games.

“We are deﬁnitely seeing improve-
ments,” Chin said. “Our understand-
ing on how to win games is getting
better. We are winning some games
on the road, which is importantfor us.
We work on things during the week,
and then, we see the improvements
in the games.”

The Panthers play again on Sept.
11 when they take on Drexel in Phila-
delphia. Two games remain until Big
East play starts against West Virginia
on Sept. 18.

Panthers blow lead, lose in
overtime to No. 16 USCB

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

Two days after losing a close
matchup with the Buffalo Bulls
1-0, the Pitt men’s soccer team
dropped another tight game —
this time to the No. 16 University
of California Santa Barbara Gau-
chos 4-3.

The loss was the Panthers’
second during the West Virginia
Nike Classic Tournament and is
the last action they will see until
their home opener Friday against
Green Bay.

Pitt (1—2- 0) held the lead three
times against the ranked Gauchos
(3-0-0) but was unable to stop UC
Santa Barbara’s comeback effort
that culminated in a goal by Mar-
tin Hedevag during overtime.

The Panthers started quickly
when a seventh-minute header
from junior forward Terry Boland
found the back of the net. Gauchos
forward David Walker responded
with a far-post equalizer moments
later. .

Dade came off the bench to score
two goals for the Panthers in 48
minutes. McDade now has three
goals through three games this

season, a mark that ties his goal

total from last year.

McDade’s second goal gave the

Panthers the lead in the 81st min-
ute, but UC Santa Barbara’s Walker
answered with his own second
goal, striking a shot from the top
of the circle six minutes later.

The Gauchos dictated the game
in the second half, pressing for-
ward for 11 shots, while Pitt man-
aged just three shots after tallying
six in the ﬁrst half. UC Santa Bar-
bara also tried seven more corner
kicks during the contest.

Defenders Orane Gordon, Andy
Kalas, midﬁelder Alex Betancourt
and goalkeeper Zack Matthews
played the entire 100 minutes for
the Panthers. Redshirt sophomore
defender Sam Luffy received a yel-
low card in the 54th minute.

Pitt will take on Green Bay and
La Salle this weekend before be-
ginning its conference schedule
with Cincinnati on Friday, Sept.
18.

Pitt plays No.
ﬁnishes the wkd 2-1

1 Penn State,

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team went 2-1 in last
weekend’s Nittany Lion Invitational, falling to
two—t:ime defending national champion and No.
1-ranked Penn State in the concluding match.

Senior Meagan Dooley and juniorAmy Town
earned all-toumament honors as the Panthers
(5-2) move on to play city rival Duquesne on

Tuesday. '

It was the second consecutive weekend the
pair of Panthers was named to an all-tourna-
ment team. The previous weekend, it was the
All—Sheraton Riverside Cardinal Classic in Lou-
isville, Ky. '

“It’s awesome, and it’s abighonor,” Town said.
“Every toumamentwe play, obviously, I don’t have
any personal goal. It just happens because I love
to play as hard as I can.”

The coaching staff said it’s also pleased with
the team’s play.

“Meagan and Amy certainly were worthy of
the all-toumament team,” Pitt coach Toby Rens
said. “The efforts they gave were very key to us
having success over the weekend. I told Meagan
that her that hitting .444 against Penn State was
All-American-like.”

Dooley led the Panthers with a .481 hitting
percentage in three matches last weekend while
tallying 32 kills and 11 blocks.

Townposted44killsand12 digsinthetourna—
ment and paced the Panthers with14killsversus
Penn State. _

» Rens also said he thought Melissa Stadelman,
who hit .357 against Penn State,wasworthy of an
all-toumament nomination.

Pitttook on the No. 1-ranked team for justthe
second time in its history. The other matchup
came in 1990, when the Panthers dropped a 3-2
match against then top—ranked UCLA.

“I thought we showed a tremendous amount
of poise and heartas ateam. Iwasvery happywith
the approach we took in the match,” Rens said.
“I felt like we executed our game plan very well.
There’s no doubt Penn State is avery talented and

No. lteam right now, butwe gave it ourbest effort
and had some outstanding rallies with them.”

It was in this effort that the Panthers might
have found some respect from the spectators.

“I think people really gained a newfound re-
spect for us, even though we lost,” Dooley said.
“We took some really bigswings andwe came out
of it with some great compliments.”

Pitt and Penn State trace the roots of their
programs to 1977, with the Nittany Lions lead-
ing the all—time series 29-17. The last time the
two teams met, Penn State won 3-1 in the 2003
NCAA Tournament.

Pitt also earned shutout victories against an-
other cross-townrival, Robert Morris, and Buffalo
at the Recreation Center on Penn State’s campus
last weekend.

“I feel like we picked up quality wins against

Buffalo in the [Mid-American Conference] and

Robert Morris,” Rens said. “I liked the focus we
had. Winning those games 3-0 and knowing we
were looking forward to the Penn State match,
we still played at a high level against Buffalo and
Robert Morris.”

Town led the Panthers with 15 kills against
Robert Morris. Dooley and Stadelman notched
12 and 11 kills, respectively.

Pitt out—blocked Robert Morris 10-6 in the
match. Junior Imani Harper led the way with
ﬁve blocks. A

The Panthers now lead the all—time series
against Robert Morris 20-0.

In Pitt’s second game, sophomore Allyson
Hodnik led the Panthers with 39 assists in their
victory over Buffalo. Hodnik had an assist on
every Panthers killexceptforfour. She also posted
two blocks andanace inthewin. .

“Ally didareally greatjob of runningtheteam
allweekend,”Rens said. “She came up with really
great plays and great saves.”

Town again led the Panthers with 15 kills
against Buffalo, while senior Michelle Rossi and
junior Melanie Feldman each had nine digs.

After their match against Duquesne on Tues-
day, the Panthers traveltoAlbuquerque, N.M., this
weekend totake on Baylor, Calstate Fullerton and
New Mexico in the New Mexico Toumament.

Ready for the NFL to start? Don’t forget your cheat sheet

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

You feel that?

That little yank that just tugged you right
then? That pull beneath you? That quake? '

That’s professional football starting up
again. Yes, it’s here already. It sneaks up on
fans, with only four weeks of preseason, a
month of training camp, free agency, the draft
and whatever Tom Brady does to prime view-
ers.
Did you not know? It’s okay. Many people
take a break from football over the summer
in favor of less worthy pursuits, such as golf,
part~time jobs and family.

Over the summer, the contract status of Al-

bert Haynesworth or the legal status ofPlaxico

Burress is superﬂuous information.

But now football is upon us.

So you don’t enter the season wildly unpre-
pared, the following Oﬂicial Week One Cheat
Sheet packs more tidbits and helpful hints than
any other William Pitt Union-based student-
run newspaper. Note: the Official Week One
Cheat Sheet contains no answers to upcom-
ing exams. . ,

First, Sunday is football time. Sunday,
though, is also homework time. These do
not mix. Solution: Watch Sunday’s games in
a room with a table or, preferably, wireless
Internet. Wireless Internet is favored over a
table because you can always use your laptop

‘ as a backer, but you can’t check fantasy football

with a countertop.

Additionally, complete all homework be-
fore the ﬁrst game ends. Beware the Sunday
night double—whammy. The only thing worse
than your team losing is your team losingwith
derivatives still to do.

Don’t pass up the game altogether, though.
You’ll miss too much. Instead, wisely divvy
up your attention. There are a few important
things to watch for this week. Hint: It’s not
Rams-Seahawks. .

Start the weekend urmecessarily early with
Titans-Steelers on Thursday night. Keep an
eye out for Titans running back combo Chris
Johnson and LenDale White, thebest combi-
nation of backﬁeld speed and power in the
league today.

Let that game soak in for two days. Then,
on the third day, rise and turn on Eagles-Pan-
thers. Although Michael Vick will not play,
former Pitt rtmning back LeSean McCoy will,
and talent-laden Philadelphia possesses about
ﬁve or six other weapons on offense.

On the other sideline, DeAngelo Williams
might be the league’s most underrated running
back. He alone is worth your time.

That night, catch Jay Cutler as he makes
his Chicago Bears debut against Green Bay
after demanding a trade out of Denver in the
offseason. He did not, though, demand wide
receiver corps as weak as Chicago’s. Watch to
see how quickly he wishes he still had Brandon
Marshall.

And if Carolina’s Williams tops the under-
rated running back list, Chicago’s Matt Forte

eerily lurks right behind him. Plus, it might
rain, and rain makes 4—yard runs and under-
thrown passes enthralling.

Every football game, though, has down-
time. Pass this time playing “What Happened to
Him?” instead of watching beer commercials.
In ‘What Happened to Him?” one armchair
quarterback shouts out a former player, and
others try to guess the current whereabouts
of that player. ' ,

For example, muse at halftime about Adam
Jones. What happened to him? Answer: The
comerback formerly known as “Pacman”
agreed in principle to play with Winnipeg of the

Canadian Football League, but Winnipeg later
decided against it. He remains a free agent.

Akili Smith? If you correctly guess that the
ﬁrst—round bust now pursues a master’s degree
in theology and divinity, the game ends and
you win.

When football returns from the commer-
cial break, continue to ignore Brett Favre’s
debut. He faces Cleveland. Besides, if anything
important happens, ﬁve television networks,
70 newspapers, a few hundred thousand blogs
and a man-shouting at you from the street
corner will alertyou immediately.

Also avoid the Monday Night Football

matchups. Buffalo faces New England in the ,
ﬁrst game of the doubleheader. Traditionally,
in—division rivalries are great. The Patriots,
though, have defeated the Bills 11 straight
times. _

In addition, wide receiver and cable televi~
sion personality Terrell Owens still nurses a
toe injury. And Marshawn Lynch is suspended‘?
And the Bills ﬁrst team failed to score an of-
fensive touchdown in the preseason — and in
the last game of last season.

Can they start the second game early?

Oal<land’s playing? Hmm.

Maybe Monday night is homework time.
