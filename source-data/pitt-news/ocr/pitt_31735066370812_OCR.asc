Engineering Dept. receives grant
from Amoco to fund scholarships

By Jack Burkman
For The Pitt News

The Department of Chemical and
-Petroleum Engineering at the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh was awarded yester-

day with grants totaling $10,000 by the
Amoco Foundation. The department
was given $3,000 for scholarships and
‘a total of $7,000 for unrestricted use
in both chemical and petroleum
segments of the department.

The Amoco Foundation also award-
ed the mechanical engineering depart-

».ment $2,000 for departmental use.

According to Dr. Shiao-Hung
Chiang, a professor of chemical
engineering, the scholarship money
will be awarded to students primarily
on the basis of academic excellence and
not ﬁnancial needs.

Chiang emphasized that these grants
will enable the department to purchase
additional equipment. He also said he
feels the grants will help attract a
greater number of students with higher
QPAs.

Conoco Corporation’s North
American Production Division also has
pwarded the engineering department a
$4,000 grant, of which $3,000 is in-

tended for scholarships.

Dr. ’Alan Reznik, the director of the
department, said the grants from both
Amoco and Conoco -are generally
presented on an annual basis.
However, he added that he was
somewhat surprised at the generosity
this year compared to the past.

Reznik said the grants are part of a
reciprocity between Pitt and the two
corporations. He said the contributions
are used to improve engineering pro-

‘grams at Pitt so that, in turn, more
competent engineers are made
available. Reznik added, though, that
the ants. are given “with no strings
attac ed.”
According to Reznik, the recipients
- of the scholarship are perceived by the
companies to be among the finest
students. -The scholarships thus serve
as a means by which companies can
“identify their best engineering pros-
pects.”

United Faculty urges

Board to divest funds

By Michael Ashford
Staff Writer

The United Faculty of the University
of Pittsburgh issued a statement to the
board of trustees on Wednesday urg-
ing them to divest current stock
holdings in companies which do
business in South Africa.

The United Faculty contends that
such holdings result in the university
“directly or indirectly participating in
the apartheid system.”

United Faculty President Philip
Wion said, “We think it's high time
the board reconsider the investment
policy as concerns South Africa.”

The statement was approved by a

unanimous vote of the United Faculty
executive council. In the letter, United
Faculty reasoned that the Sullivan Prin-
ciples are an inadequate condition for
investments, “since they do not
challenge the apartheid system as a
whole.” - _ »

_In addition, according to the letter,

threat to university holdings there,
while “other; equally proﬁtable” in-
vestment opportunities existelsewhere.

actly how many faculty members are
associated with the organization.

Pitt’s Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center to continue the project
started a year ago in Pittsburgh’s Mar-
tin Luther King elementary school.

‘ ‘The main purpose of the system, ’ ’
said the project’s director, William W.
Cooley of LRDC, “is to help school
professionals plan improvements and
put them into practice. It’s designed to

let the school principals and others
spend less time tracking down informa-
tion and more time focusing on the
issues of education.”

‘ ‘Left-brain’ ’ people dominate the world, lecturer says

By Michelle Zollner
For The Pitt News

‘ ‘Right-hemisphere people feel as
though they are marching to a different
drummer,’ ’ according to Ladonna
Green Bates. Her seminar Wednesday
night at the Center for Human
Development dealt with “right-brain
people living in the left-brain world.’ ’

Bates’ expertise comes from work-
ing with the l98l Nobel Prize winner
Dr. Roger Sperry, who won the award

forhisworkwiththedominanceofthc .

right and left brain. Also, Bates re-
ceived information and inspiration
from Barbara Vitale. She as well as
Bates toured the country and gave lec-
tures concerning the topic of
dominance. Bates hopes to‘ lecture in
the future on “choosing a college ma-
jor with your brain dominance in
mind.”

According to Bates, people who have
recognized that they are right-
hemisphere dominant often suppress
their day-to-day difficulties, because
theynoticethatothersseemtohave1it-
tleor_noprobler'nswiththe_s'ametasks.‘

The simplest way to characterize a right-brain per-
son would be byhis creative ability, whereas the left-
brain person would be logical.

A young child’s mother, for instance,
might notice her child reading a book
upside down. Her immediate response
might be to turn the child’s book the
correct way. She would continue the
same action until thechild learned to
hold his book the proper way.

Bates said that she,does not recom-

mend the mother’s action. Instead, she
would encourage the mother to be‘ pa-
tient and to allow the child to read as
he pleases, for each individu_al_s_ho_uld_
work with their brain, in order to func-
tion with the greatest ease.

The lecture transformed from a for-
mal to an informal atmosphere,

which '

   

Bates entitled a relaxed “get ac- -

quain ” discussion. Through their
different questions and answers, a clear
distinction between the listeners’ right
and left brain was made, and they were
able to determine their dominant side..
Individuals who were unsure of their
dominance compared their lives with
the characteristics of others who had
already established their dominance.

White House spokesman Larry
Speakes told a news conference that
four F"--14s from the aircraft carrier
"USS Saratoga intercepted the Egyptian
airliner carrying the four hijackers in
“international airspace" over the
Mediterranean. He said the ﬁghters
escorted the airliner to the US-Italian
Sigonella military base near Catania,
Sicily. Speakes said the four pirates are
in Italian custody and that the US will
seek extradition.

Speakes said that after the airliner
took off from Egypt, President Reagan
directed the US armed forces to in-
tercept and escort the airliner to the
base. When the plane landed it was im-
mediately surrotmded by US and Italian
troops.

The White House spokesman told
reporters that no shots were ﬁred dur-
ing the operation.

Speakes said “We used every means
at our disposal to ﬁnd out where the
hijackers were. We were able to locate
the aircraft, pursue it [and] persuade
it to go to the air base."

Gambling debts

disapproved of

(New Jersey) —- A New Jersey garn-
ing official wants to do away with

credit extensions to gamblers at Atlan-
tic City casinos, despite protests from
casino owners that much of their
business is done on credit. The state
says the system is plagued with
regulatory problems and it disapproves
of the widespread casino practice of
providing gamblers with free drinks.

“Strawberry Fields”
memorial dedicated

The Memorial Garden ‘ ‘Strawberry
Fields” was dedicated in New York’s
Central Park Wednesday to the
memory of former Beatle John Len-
non, a tribute on what would have been
his 45th birthday.

Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, said the
garden is a result of many people
dreaming together. Borrowing a line
from the Beatles song “Hey Jude,” she
called it ‘ ‘our way of taking a sad song
and making it better.”

The 2'/5-acre memorial is at the
park's 72nd Street entrance, across
Central Park West from the Dakota
Apartments, where Lennon and Ono
lived and where he was shot to death
in December 1980.

The garden includes trees, plants and

‘other gifts from '23 nations, but the

United States is Trot represented. The
garden is nourished by American soil.

U.S. earthquakes
probable, experts say

Experts testifying before Congress
said that it's just a matter of time before

.a destructive earthquake, even as bad

as the one that hit Mexico City two
weeks ago, will strike an American ci-
ty. Scientists speaking before a Senate
panel spoke about areas in the central
Mississippi Valley as possible locations
for an earthquake. These locations in-
clude seismically active portions of
Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois.

Threatened cities and towns lie
within a 200-mile radius of the
Missouri boot-heel town of New
Madrid, the site of major destructive
earthquakes in the winter of 1811-12

in Sicily

whose intensity caused the Mississip-
pi River to ﬂow backward.

The experts say that the western
states of California, Oregon",
Washington and Alaska are also
threatened.

Dinosaur extinction possibly caused  

by large asteroid, Dr. Gould as

By Bonnie Kartzman
Staff Writer '

Historian, philosopher and science
writer all took one form at the Carnegie
Museum on Oct. 9 at 8:30 p.m.
Paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould,
Ph.D., gave a lecture on evolution as
a part of the 1985 Man and Ideas
Series, sponsored by the Council for
Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
Gould divided the lecture into two
segments: dinosaur extinction and the
concept of individuality as it relates to
biology.

Gould has produced seven books,
writes a monthly colunm in a natural
history magazine and has appeared in
a one—hour special television program
called “Nova.” After receiving the
National Book Award for Science in
1981, Gould, who teaches at Harvard,
was named Scientist of the Year by
Discover magazine.

Deﬁning science as “a way of know-
ing, the art of validation,” Gould
discussed three theories for dinosaur

extinction and their value in reference ‘ I,

to that deﬁnition. He classiﬁed the con-
cepts into what he felt were dominant
issues in society: sex, drugs and
disaster.

In sex theory‘, Gould suggested that
a “pronounced rise in temperature”
may have interfered with dinosaur-
reproducing abilities, thus resulting in
sterilization and consequent extinction.
The drug theory, on the other hand,
proposed the evolution of a poisonous,
alkaloid-producing group of plants that
the dinosaurs may have been eating.
Because their livers were unable to

detoxify the plants, the dinosaurs

seemed to have “died from a massive
overdose.” said Gould.

Gould ‘found fault with these un-
provable concepts and so labeled them
‘ ‘ armchair speculations. ’ ’ ‘ ‘Testicles

 

Dr. Stephen Jay Gould

don’t fossilize, [and] livers don’t
fossilize any better than testicles,”
Gould said. ’

The third theory — proposing that an
asteroid struck the earth, making it cold
and dark, resulting in the perishing of
dinosaurs and other species — received
strong endorsement from Gould. He
found the theory “bursting with the
possibilities of its own tests.’ ’
Moreover, it met his criteria for good
science by being “expansive, self-
corrective and sociaﬂy useful.”

The second part of the lecture dealt
with Gou1d’s emphasis of a “need to
bind together and put aside individual
differences,” in contrast to Darwin’s
concept of individuality as “a snuggle
for survival [and] a competition for
personal reward.” Gould stressed that
because Darwinian criteria for status as
an individual includes “a recognizable
beginning, stability, a recognizable en-
ding and the ability to give rise to
descendants,” it is also applicable to

‘entire species and not just single

bodies.

End Terrorism

The hijacking of the Italian cruise ship in the eastern
Mediterranean provided world leaders with yet another
incident of international terrorism. Sadly, terrorist ac-
tions perpetrated by a variety of organizations have
become commonplace throughout the world as a means
of securing political ends. The number of terrorist
organizations claiming to have a legitimate political
cause has become frighteningly large. The diversi-
ty, cunning, and audacity of such organizations have
made policing and surveillance by international
authorities an increasingly futile endeavor.

The point to be made is this: acts of terrorism have
come to pervade international politics and world
leaders are powerless to prevent them. The United
States and the Soviet Union alike have discovered that
military might provides no security against terrorist
violence for private citizens abroad. When American
citizens become victims in terrorist plots, President
Reagan may see ﬁt to proudly puff out his chest and
roar like a maddened beast, but such affectations are
nothing more than mere bravado, and America’s im-
potence is readily apparent.

What, if anything, can be doneto protect American
citizens abroad from acts of terrorism and violence?
United States policy-makers must soon address this
question. It would indeed be unfortunate should a case
such as the Iranian hostage crisis reoccur. And it would
be still more regrettable should a brutal killing such
as occured on the hijacked cruise ship be repeated in
the future. Let’s put some effort into this one, boys,
and see if we can’t produce a solution.

‘Nuclear’ Accident

The caption accompanying the pic-
ture of Three-Mile Island in The Pitt
News on Oct. 4 stated, “This will be
the first time the plant is used since a
near meltdown crippled a second reac-
tor in 1983.”.

We all know the ﬁrst near meltdown
occurred in March 1979, but we never
knew anything about the second one in
1983. Who was responsible for restart-

-ing the reactor that resulted in this se-
cond near meltdown? Why weren’t we
notified of this ?

Does this have anything to do with
the “White Tower Incident” of last
spring? Is this another communist plot
to give nuclear power a bad name and
ﬁirther decrease the already slim
chance of a person with a B.S. in
physics of getting a job? Or is this a
continuation of the famous “What’s
wrong with this picture” contest from
last year? If so, what do we win?

for their criticism of the Israeli bomb-
ing of Tunisia and for criticizing the
Zionist lobby in the United States. To
further his insult of the editorial staff,
Mr. Grayson compared their criticism
of the Zionist lobby in the United
States, to “the drafters of the protocols
of the Elders of Zion, the propagandists
of Hitler’s Third Reich and  the
KKK.”

To start out with, I can hardly believe
that anyone could seriously charge the
editorial staff of The Pitt News with
harboring neo-Nazi sympathies. Their
criticism of the Zionist lobby in the
United States was completely fair and
accurate, and I fully support the
editorial staff on these points.

Mr. Grayson should realize that
there is a distinction between Zionism
and Judaism. All Jews are not Zionists
(e.g., Alfred Lilienthal), and all
Zionists are not Jews (e.g., Jerry
Falwell).

Zionism is an oppressive and offen-
sive system, the apartheid of the Mid-
dle East. The Zionists in the United
States, including Rev. Falwell, are con-
tinually trying to equate anti—Zionism
with anti-Semitism. This is a low trick
and a shallow argument. The real
nature of Zionism cannot remain hid-
den from the public through this cheap
trick of sophistry.

Letters to theEditor

This real nature of Zionism, a A

militarist and imperialist nature, is what
Rev. Falwell and his Zionist friends are
defending (which by the way 1S con-
sistent with his defense of another
militarist and imperialist state in
Africa). , _

I oppose Zionism because I believe
in freedom and justice, and I call upon
all freedom-loving people to join with
me in dispelling the myth ‘that the
Zionist lobby has created arid_in expos-
ing Zionism for the apartheid system
that it is. ’

responds

This letter is in response to Mr.

Heineman’s letter of Oct. 4, 1985, in ‘

which the FAS Graduate Council was

accused of “insensitivity, ignorance"
and racism” for refusing to publicly

support an anti-apartheid demonstra-

tion. We would first like to suggest that
Mr. I-Ieineman correctly identify the

organization he  The organiza-

tion he approached is the FAS Graduate

Student Organization not the FAS

Graduate Council. We apologize to

Dean Barranger and the members of
the FAS Graduate Council for this

mistake.

We would also like to point out a few
pertinent facts that Mr. Heinemaii
omitted from his letter. The purpose
of the FAS-GSO is to represent the in-
terests of the graduate students in the
FAS, not to be a vehicle for political
movements. He also fails to mention
that despite the fact that his proposal
was not placed on the agenda prior to
the meeting, it was not “ﬂippantly
dismissed” but discussed for approx-
imately 30 minutes. Due to the lack of
quorum and the inability to instantly
notify the membership of FAS-GSO,
we could not possibly take action on
this issue. We did, however, agree to
notify the membership of the date and
place of the demonstration. The FAS-
GSO has issued no opinion pro or con,
of the anti-apartheid demonstration and
Mr. Heineman is quite misguided in at-
tributing the opinions of individual
representatives as such.

Perhaps if Mr. Heineman were more
concerned with the obligations of a
representative to FAS-GSO, he would
bebetterinforrnedastothenaine, pur-
pose and functioning of this organiza-
tion. We regret that his vehemenee and
obvious lack of tolerance for opinions

misleading and poorly considered
criticism of this organization.

No Hunting

I’ve just about had it with these
bizarre and ridiculous statements made
by Mr.’s Szalla, Brodbeck and
Muncini.

I refer to such comments in the Oct. ~

4 and 7 papers as, “Hunters are indeed
true sportsmen,” and “[Hunting] is a
harvest to make the deer population
healthy.”

Nothing could be further from the
truth. Hunters are a small but very
vocal group that has managed to dupe
the public, playing on its sympathies.
The reason most people do not object
to their destruction of our wildlife is
that they believe animals, deer in par-
ticular, will die grisly deaths by star-
vation if they are not mercifully shot.
Not so!

Much of the money that hunters pay
in fees actually goes to produce a deer

overpopulation. Wildlife management .

departments put out tons ‘of hay and
other foodstuffs every winter, and
create predator control programs.
Why? Well, these things are done to
produce a surplus of deer for the
mighty hunters to bag. _

Will deer soon be grazing on the
Cathedral lawn if we don’t trim the
herd? No! Were the deer population
allowed to stabilize without in-
terference from our friendly Fish and
Game Commission, the animals would
naturally stop their own overpopula-
tions. How? By changes in the female’s
heat cycles, and survival of the ﬁttest.
The ﬁttest do not survive now because
the hunters do not want to kill any old
buck. When is the last time you saw

a ﬂea bitten, sickly, bag of bones tied

to the fender of someone’s Ford? Heck,
the points are what's important here!

But let's get down to the nitty grit-
ty. What kind of person would ﬁnd it
enjoyable to cause and witness the
death of a beautiful animal? How can
killing be considered a sport? These are
live, sentient creatures, not ears of corn
to be “harvested!”

Speaking of corn, Mr. Szalla, this
writer is an herbivore.

Cults In The Life Of Mind

There exists cults in the life of the

H mind. These cults attach themselves to

innocuous sounding concepts. One
such cult, which has attracted many
followers and threatens to permanent-
ly scar‘the body politic and the corpus
of knowledge, believes that “post-
industrial” is a useful concept to
understand advanced capitalist coun-
tries. High priests admittedly are not
usually associated with cults, but the
likes of Daniel Bell and Zbignew
Brzezinski promulgate this cult. Alas,
even our own Provost, Roger Benjamin
hasjoinedtheranksofthecultwithhis
The Limits of Politics (1980).
Despite the obviously small data
base, post-industrial society is said to
be marked by a decline in the growth
rate in the industrial sector and a rise
in the rate of growth in the service sec- .
tor (conceived broadly enough to in-
clude public and regulatory functions).
Related to this is a slowdown in the
overall rate of economic growth. The
onset of service sector dominance is
said to bring with it a change in social
needs and emphasis in social institu-
tions. Values change as the institu-
tionalized parameters, such as family
and local community, which were
formerly boundaries on individual
choice, relax, if not dissolve.
Politically there is a rise in grass root
activity and demand for participation;
a decline in political party identiﬁca-
tion, and a growth of apathy. Yet, some
contend, like Provost Benjamin, that

‘ post-industrial society is one of par’-

ticipation, not authority. Citizens are
not so willing to delegate their rights

Viewpoint: Candidates Speak Out  

_ people should be ruled by those they

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer -

“What is your View of apartheid in
South Africa?” This is the question
staff writer John Zaphyr "put to a
number of homecoming king and queen
candidates. It is hoped that their
responses, as listed below, will serve
to help the reader better judge the
qualiﬁcations of the various candidates
to hold the honors for which they
strive.’ .

_ Janine Ann Disante: “I think 'it’s
terrible. If blacks and whites can get



  

to leaders of established and centralized
institutions.

One of the main political problems
confronting a'post-industrial society is

A the increase of inequality of income,

which requires substantial redress, but
is necessarily constrained by slower
economic growth. .

In spite of the intuitive truthfulness
of the cult’s propositions, they are
specious, and more importantly lead to
wrongheaded policies. If we sincerely
want to understand, as op sed to
apologize for, advanced capitalist
societies, I submit a more useful con-

,cept: accumulation-disaccumulation.

While the cultists note the overall
decline in the proportion of the
workforce employed in the post-
industrial production sector, they do
not comprehend this phenomenon. The
accumulation-disaccumulation concep-
tual framework focuses directly on this
development. Accumulation refers to
the ratio between the labor time of peo-
ple exercising their labor power and the
(social) labor time embodied in _the
means of production (tools, machines,
factories, etc.). More simply, ac-
cumulation involves the ratio between
living labor and past, “dead” labor.
During accum_ulati'on increased produc-
tion requires increased employment of
Living labor power.

At the point where production and
operation of the means of production
results in expanding the production of
goods without the expansion of labor
power, accumulation is said to be
transformed into disaccumulation.
Disaccumulatioii means that the expan-

Michelle Ann Bell: “I’m very
against it. I’m against the university’s
policy and I think they should totally
divest. I'm an active leader in BAS and
we’re going to protest on Friday
because of the university’s policy on
divestment. ’ ’

Jack Henderson: “It’s something no
one agrees with, and something I
strongly disagree with, and I think it
should be abolished. It's a human
disgrace the way blacks are

‘ discriminated against and that govem-

ment should be dissolved.”

. seriously consider all sides of the issue

sion of goods production proceeds as
a function of the sustained decline of
necessary labor-time employed in
goods production. 1

The outcome of the accumulation
process is disaccumulation, i.e., in-
creasingly human labor — the exercise
of liying labor power — recedes from
the condition of serving as a factor of
production. Living labor power in
goods production is quantitatively and
qualitatively reduced to watching,
regulating and superintending.

As people are increasingly released
from the immediate production and
reproduction of the material means of

life, a new social order is both possi- '

ble and necessary. Social relations can
no longer be determined by the im-
mediate relations of people in the pro-
duction process. Insofar as social labor
time is not signiﬁcantly required for
goods production, such goods contain
no value (i.e., materialized labor
power). Disaccumulaﬁon is the precon-
dition for severing work as such from
income, or what is the same thing,
from access to society’s goods.

The post-industrial cult does not
comprehend the signiﬁcance of what
they claim to be investigating. The
problem of production has been solved.
Prior to the 1920s in America, increas-
ed production necessitated an increase
in manhours of work. Since then we
have been capable of producing more
by working less. A new society is
within our grasp, byt tl_1g cultists are
more interested in’ preserving aiellaic
social relations and institutions.

Susan Block: “I’m not for any type
of oppression of any sort of people. I
feel South Africa needs some equal
rights adjustments.”

Lori Oliver: “I don’t think any type
of segregation is right.”

Paige Allen: “I don’t like it and I
don’t think it should be there.”

Athena Zaras: “I don’t think any na-

According to Bates this is due to the
fact that right-brain people start with
the conclusion and work toward the
beginning, or start in the middle and
work out the sides. This right-brain
quality would be present in an in-
dividual who begins to read a
newspaper starting from the last page.

Although the lecture was focused to

Bates.

Since Bates herself is a right-brain
person, she sympathized with the au-
dience’s problems. She also gave the
disheartening news that the “left-brain
(people) don't change.” The end solu-
tion to the difﬁculties from which the
right brain suffers, besides have pa-
tience, was to “understand the way we
are and to accept it.”

The true story — no sympathy for the devils

THE TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE
ROLLING STONES

Stanley Booth

Random House

By Emma Cleary

Frankie says: The most important
convention of the expression of
ecstasy is the theatrical superficiality
of its enactment. Mick Jagger is
nothing if not highly aware of this,
despite his feigned ignorance.

Stanley Booth was an undetached,
drugged-up, semi-professional writer
when he got his big chance to cover
the 1969 Rolling Stones tour. This was
the tour which ended in the atrocities
at Altamont Speedway in California.
Booth misinterpreted the pseudo-
messianic, fakiristic roilings of Mick
Jagger when he throttled the American
youth market for every penny he could,
in reckless disregard of his respon-
sibility for mental, emotional and
physical damage. The peace and love
cliches were always ashes in the
mouth of Jagger, but he used them
because he realized that they were
effective.

Booth still doesn't have the distance
or the brains to hammer that decade
into a vision of clarity. Fifteen years
later, he is still unconsciously trying to
impress the locals with the incredible
amounts of drugs he did with The Roll-
ing Stones. This book is a testament
to the distortion and damage that
drugs wreak upon the human value

‘which compelled Booth to tie the '60s,
the Stones and his own lost youth into
a nice, tidy sociologic bundle which is
as synthetic as the day is long.

It was just downright annoying to
read superfluous French and Anglo-
English colloquialisms and expres-I

system.

I should state that I enjoyed this
book.

It has, however, some serious struc-
tural flaws. Each chapter begins with
a usually pretentious quote from some
modern European heavyweight in-
tellectual. Unfortunately, these quotes
die on the vine as nothing more than
inappropriate pop-sentimentalism

sions when they are not used in the
service of communication. An
American citizen does not cross the
“tarmac” with a “fag” in his ear while
paying $10 “American” for a boite in
sang froid over an Auburn University
“plate of meats.” Booth is from
Waycross, but he can wear his ac-
quired sophistication on his sleeve
almost as well as Lglita’s mother '

 

Nabokov’s novel (and she got hit by a
car).

Lest I be accused of being a pop-
cultural Cassandra in clogs, I would
like to make note of some of this
book’s strengths. There are many
places where the text opens up into

"stag

page after page of solid writing. The

thumbnail sketches of numerous musi- .

cians such as Ike Turner, B.B. King,
Bukka White, Gram Parsons, Tina
Turner and lesser-knowns are often
brilliant and right to the point. Booth
captues some incredible moments of
candid, naked, on-the-road reality. In
one moment Ike Turner comes off-
' dM'kJ erak him,

     

           

“Howls Itgolng? Turn replie, I'm
looking good, working hard and starv-
ing to death," as he slams the
dressing-room door in Jagger's face.

This book is worth its $4.95 price tag-

— but step with caution over its
excesses.

 Jane Wiedlin:

Goo Goo Muck

JANE WIEDLIN
Jane Wiedlin
I.R.S.

One of the more insidious trends
spawned by punk and its aftermath
was a form of pop that I will call, to bor-
row a phrase from the Cramps, “Goo-
Goo Muck.” Practitioners in this
musical medium embraced cuteness
as a way of life. “We’re all children,”
they would giggle, “and life is a great
big lollipop.” The most heinous of-
fenders were 'Altered Images and,
when they failed to keep the tendency
in check, the Go-Go's.

Fortunately, fans of “New Music”
grew tired of this particular genre, and
after a brief bout of popularity, it seem-
ed to fade away. But beware, brothers
and sisters: The dreaded Goo-Goo
Muck has reared its ugly head once
more. '

In all fairness, much of Jane

WiedIin’s work with the Go-Go's _

wasn't bad. Along with Charlotte Caf-
frey and Kathy Valentine, Wiedlin coin-
ed a distinctive pop-songwriting tech-
nique. The band's overall V sound
sometimes rose above the cuteness
level, thanks to Belinda Car|isle’s
voice, which had a little grit, and Gina
Schock’s drumming, which had more
than a little whomp.

On her own, ‘though, Wiedlin is
dreadful. “Blue Kiss,” a single, opens

the album on an optimistic note, but it
is far and away the album's best song.
After that the bottom falls out and we
are.Ieft with 10 songs that fail in only
slighty varying degrees.

Why? These songs are silly, whiny
and amateurish, very unlike the high-
quality material Wiedlin sometimes
achieved with her former band. Why
has she even recorded this stuff? She
has proven in the past that she has a

, good ear for what works and an innate

feel for pop hooks; she must know how
bad this material is, and it is indeed
bad.

“Goodbye Cruel World,” for exam-
ple, typifies the album's banality. Dur-
ing the verses, she lists, very earnest-
ly, all the things that are wrong with the
world that she would change: No more
children hungry or bruisedl No animals
hunted for fun/ It's time to undo the
damage we've done.

Her solution? Let's’ dream it away/
Think it away.

Good one, Jane.

In “East Meets West,” she attempts
to extol Oriental culture but only suc-
ceeds in demonstrating what a ninny
she is: -I'm a cowgirl in a shrine/ Where
they applaud eight million godsl Eight
million people watch Solid Goldl That's
what they cheer where I come from.

Slightly more successful are songs
in which Wiedlin drops the lamentably
naive political poses and goes for

straight, message-less pop. such as
“Somebody’s Going to Get Into This
House” and “I Will Wait for You" (the
latter, especially, could have been a
Go-Go B-side). On the whole, however,
the songs lack anything to recommend
them — the hooks just,aren’t there. In
this type of music, hooks are
everything.

Perhaps Wiedlin is just shell-
shocked after the recent demise of the

' Go-Go's. It's hard to imagine that she

could have lost her knack for writing
catchy, clever tunes in such a short

period of time. On her next record, she
should use fewer songwriting partners,
producers and studio musicians and
take charge of the material.

Jane Wiedlin is capable of writing
good songs. Listening to this album,
though, you'd never know it. This
music is giddy, vapid and ‘completely
without effect. Stayaway from it it you
don't want the Goo-Goo Muck to get
you.

Soar with
Mr. Mister

WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
Mr. Mister »
RCA '

Close your eyes and visualize driv-
ing on an open road. Your mind comes
alive with thoughts of glorious occa-
sions and those which are better cast

‘ aside and left behind. If you aren't able

to do this yourself, listen to Mr. Mister’s
song, “Broken Wings.” this song will
take your thoughts anywhere they

 

want to wander. It doesn’t contain
lyrics of vice or of love. Instead, the ti-
tle “BrokenWings” seems to say that
we’ve been smothered in songs of
nonsense and material things; we
have to brush ourselves off and rise
back up to music that will leave a real
impression. It also tells us this may be
our last chance.

The entire. album Welcome To The
Real World is packed with songs about

everyday life that anyone can relate to. .

Mr. Mister does not sing about rain that

 

is purple or love for a Sussudio, but of
anxieties and emotions everyone
shares. The title track, for example,
.talks about breaking the chains of the
past and finding freedom. This relates’
back to the road of lost thoughts and
how we have to be strong to leave
behind unpleasant events. “Into My
Own Hands" expresses how, looking
into a mirror, we will always see lines
from our past, but they are reminders

-of lessons we have learned in order to

;continue.
Mr. Mister’s songs come on soft with
no heavy guitars or banging drums.

The words themselves are potent

enough. _
A major objection I have with a few

of these songs is their cutesy rhymes.

For example, in “Uniform Of Youth,”

the lines flow as follows: "I don ’t think
I like this place/I don ’t think I like your
face/ I don 't know if I'll stick around/ I

don ’t know, Ijust might leave town. "
It reminds me of a third grader’s feel-
ings toward school. ’

Despite this problem, Mr. Mister still

comes out on top. If you want to kick
your heels up and listen to some
smooth music, Mr. Mister will do the
trick.

TRIUMPH_OF THE WILL
Overkill O
SST Records

It has been a long time since I have
had respect for the independent record
label, SST. Founded in the early '80s
by members of the hardcore band,
Black Flag, the label's early claim to

fame was that it released raw but.
V literate rock and roll such as the Dicks,

very _early_ Minutemen (before they
started taking themselves so serious-
iii), and Black Flag’s first album, Dam-

aged, which is probably the best rock-

album of the last decade and a half;

Now, for instance, there is the new
record by Wurm, Feast. When I played
the title song, the first song on the
album, I was impressed. It_ sounded
the way most of today's heavy metal

should — but doesn’t — sound, mix- ’

ing the best elements of hardcore and
metal to create scary, shrill noise. In
addition, the lead singer, Simon

Smallwood (of Dead Hippie, a hard- I

core band), has a great voice that
sounds like Ronnie James Dio at times
and like Johnny Rotten at others.

However, as I played more of the
record, I grew disappointed. The songs
got longer, the music less spectacular
and the lyrics more audible. I soon
realized that this group nothing
special. There were a teviigood cuts
like the chaotic blues of “One For Jim-
my” and the throbbing jdeathrock of
“Nailed To The Wall," buffer the most
part, the record was mediocre.

Thus, it comes as no surprise that
Overkill (who thankfully has now
’ disbanded) is yet another one of these
bands. On their new album, Triumph
Of The Will, the band is so middle of
the road that they can't decide whether
to play metal (“Lady in Leather"),
hardcore ("Slaughtered”) or just
straight ahead rock and roll
(“American Dream”).

The nice thing about this band is that
no matter what genre of music they
play, they are consistently dull. The

singer sounds like the guy from ,~

Motorhead but without the motor; the
guitarist can barely play more than
simple leads and bar chords; and the
lyrics are of a second-grade mentali-
ty._ For instance, in this line from “Ad-
dict," they warn the listener of the
‘great peril that awaits him if he
becomes a junkie: Sick syringes sow
sullen seed/ The price you pay when

you're addicted to speed. Deep stuff, _

huh?

One wonders why SST would even
sign a band that is this bad. The
reason is that they don't care anymore.
They've sold their hardcore sen-
sibilities for hard cash. Instead of look-
ing for something new, they feed the
same old stagnant dinosaurs, giving
them free reign in the bargain. SST is
now the home of the hardcore
hypocrites, who sit on their money
bags playing it safe, waiting for their

next video to come on MTV. 2 I

By Stephen Morrison

Well, I ‘m finally beginning to
get threats on my life. lguess the

( column 's doing well.

We've got a real variety pack
this week. Lots 0’ different
bands, lots 0' different grades.
No Es, though. Where the hell is
Twisted Sister when you need
them?

A Flock of Seagulls: Transfer Affection

In case anyone's interested, and
God knows I'm not, A Flock of
Seagulls do not appear to have chang-
ed one cubit since their last record.
This, their newest single, finds the
Flock of Sissies unchanged but still
mildly appealing, sort of. Same old
synth “textures.” Same old echoing
guitar riffs. Same old singer who
sounds like a goat with a vasectomy.
Not bad, though  not bad  zzzzzz 

 
   
   
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
  

Heart: Never Run Away

This band fueled many an adoles-
cent fantasy for this boy, but now that
l’m older and colder I must say that l
ﬁnd the Vlﬁlson sisters to have become
parodies of themselves. On second
thought, they've always been parodies
of themselves. This time out, raven-
haired Annie screeches a little less

than usual, and the whole attitude’

seems more Top 40-oriented. But it’s
still annoying as hell. This band is like
syphilis: It never changes, it’s recurr-
ing and it won't go away.

D

INXS: The Time This Time

A lot of folksregard this band with
fear and loathing, and for no rational
reason. I mean, hey, just because peo-
ple are good-looking doesn't mean
they can't write credible songs, and
this ditty is nothing if not credible. INXS
have been wrongly labelled a synth-
pop band, but the truth is they can rock
with the best of ‘am. This song goes
boom, it goes bang, it goes pop-pop.

‘ It makes me go yip!'

Loverboy: Lovin’ Every Minute Of It

Here's a good one. Lessee  we got
a singer with a high-pitched voice —
good, good  we got people ‘going
“Woh-ohh" in the background  we
got subtle, socially-relevant lyrics:
Shoot me -like a rocket into
space/Lovin’ every minute of it. What

— more can I say? Loverboy prove

themselves, with each release, to be
more and more one of the greatest
bands in the history of rock.
Yes, I'm being sarcastic.

R.E.M.: Driver 8

Normally it’s best to avoid hyper-
bolizing rock bands because it might
jinx their careers (l’m superstitious).
These days, though, everyone is rav-
ing over Fl.E.M., so what the hell. I
have stated in print that I consider
H.E.M. currently to be the "finest band
in the country, and l have not yet come
to regret , that statement. Here is
evidence. This song is simple, country-

.based, undramatic, and it is perfect.

Listen to it just once, try to forget how
it goes, and you'll see what I mean.
A

Rush: The Big Money

The big turning point in .Flush’s
career seems to have been when they
discovered The Police, and that there
was more you could do with the power-
trio concept than simply make as much
noise as possible (see “New World
Man”). Geddy Lee realized that hav-
ing a God—given ability to shriek
hideously doesn't mean that you
should necessarily use it, and Neal
Peart figured out that just because you

have a 900piece drum set — well, you

get the idea.

I’m not sure what exactly the point
is they're trying to make about “big
money,” but they sound convincingly
righteous, and l have to admit, grudg-
ingly, that this tune ain't bad, preten-
tious art-metal though it is. It is pep-
pered with nutty time signatures, lest
someone mistakes it for a dance song
(God forbidl). Lee stays in a register
low enough so that any crystal in the
house doesn't detonate, and Alex
Lifeson has, as usual, some interesting
guitar bits here and there. And there’s
a nifty, simple (almost punk simple —

Style Council: Walls Come Tumbling

Down

I'm sick and tired of hearing people
cry about how great The Jam were and
how awful The Style Council are. The
fact is, there is little valid ground for
comparison: The two bands represent
completely different genres (though

_ The Jam were, in their latter days,

heading in the direction that The Style
Council have embraced). Paul Weller
is still a consummate songwriter, if he
has perhaps limited his vision, and his
best songs still pack a wallop. “Walls
Come Tumbling Down” finds Weller
sounding quite a lot like David Bowie
(aggressive mode) in a slam-bang

Motown groove. One small complaint: -

The melody borrows shamelessly from
an older Style Council number, “The
Whole Point Of No Return.” But then
again, Weller always has been one to
redefine and expand his ideas. And I
can live without his politics.

mander, better known as Matrix. Once
the former leader of a special-
operations strike force assigned to
areas where political controversy has
been greatest, Matrix is known for his
strength and power.

After retiring, Matrix starts a new life
in a beautiful, calm, rural area with his
11-year-old daughter Jenny.
Everything is picture perfect until
General Arius (Dan Hedya), the former
dictator of Val Verde, catches up with
Matrix and kidnaps his daughter.

Arius, who lost command at the
hands of Matrix and his men and was
replaced by a democratically-elected
president, is out to get back both his
position and Matrix.

Throughout “Commando,” he kills
everyone who gets in his way, in-
cluding several policemen and an “en-

single twist and even drops a man off
a cliff, after swinging him around for a
while (with his weak arm). When ask-
ed what happened to him, he claims,
‘‘I let him go.” ~ .

Each gruesomescene in the film is
followed by some sort of pun. it's sick
humor, but it does take away from the
blood and gore, of which there is more
than enough.

Matrix has to fight off everyone, ex-
cept for Cindy, his one ally throughout
the.film. Matrix meets Cindy (Rae Don
Chang) in an -odd way: He just happen-

ed to kidnap her during a getaway in
an airport. She turns out to be the
perfect sidekick — she's gutsy‘ (she
blows the back off a police wagon with
dynamite) and intelligent, and she
even knows how to fly a plane.

Cindy is also hilarious. Her off-the-
wall, wisecracking sense of humor is
definitely one of the best aspects of the
film. She adds a nice balance to “Com-
mando”, by being just the opposite of
Schwarzenegger.

Overall, the movie's not too awful. '6

Th “Rel Thing”
needs preservatives

By leslle Bennett

Tom Stoppard is playwright with an
uncanny command of the English
language, which is above all else what
The Real Thing has going for it. While
a verbal gold mine of witticisms and
wordplay, this romantic comedy is also
a thoughtful and sensitive play about
those words.

“l don't think writers are sacred,”
say Henry, Stoppard’s quasi-
autobiographical character, “but
words are. And if you get the right ones
in the right order, you can nudge the
world a little.”

From a literary perspective, The Real
Thing might be just the right thing to
curl up in bed with, to read and reread,
soaking up all that sacredness.

’ That's one way to really enjoy The
Real Thing. It may, however, be the on-
Iy way.

In the past, Stoppard’s plays, in-

-cluding Hosencrantz and Guildenstern

are Dead, have been praised for their
technical theatricality, making them
more successful on the stage than on
the printed page. If that's the case with
The Real Thing, which won four Tony
Awards in 1984, then Pittsburgh Public

Theater's production, directed by Lee -

Sankowich, somehow fails to capitalize
on Stoppard’s dramatic intentions.
The play concerns the artistic and
romantic affairs of two couples but
places emphasis and energy into the
development of one initially adulterous
relationship between Henry, a

playwright played by Thomas A.
Stewart, and Annie, an actress played
by Helena Ruoti. Henry and Annie
leave their respective spouses to live
happily ever after together but soon
discover areas of love for which they
might not have been prepared. Annie
can’t seem to come up with the proper
guilt of having deceived someone she
loves, and Henry can't seem to come
up with the proper love.

‘‘I love love. I love having a lover,”
he says.

It’s probably the oldest theme in the
book, and its universality may be what
hurts this production. After all, as a
love story, The Real Thing is a surefire
thing, but it risks becoming stale at
every exposure. What it simply cannot
afford is a protagonist for whom an au-

supposedly experiences some
epiphany of self-realization, Stewart
fails to bring that evolution across.

serious remarks about love come off
cheaply because of her excessively
groovy get-up.

Without allowing hometown
favoritism to cloud any opinions, it is
safe to say that Helena Ruoti’s per-
formance shone above the rest. She
may have a knack for finding herself
in favorable roles, but once there she
certainly earns her keep. It's actually
difficult not to watch her whenever
she’s on the stage.

The central action of the play is the
writing, producing and acting of a
political play written by a prison inmate
named Brodie (Don Fischer), which
provides for intricate play-within-a-play
structuring. We see a romance be-
tween Annie and fellow actor Billy
(Stephen Culp) begin on-stage and
continue off-stage.

Finally, however, Annie and Henry
appear to reckon with faithand the play
ends on a note of pop optimism. So
they live happily ever after, after all.

As the opener for PPT’s 11th
season, The’ Real Thing is really
nothing to write home about.

standard rules of fashion. This can
lead to embarrassing and costly
mistakes. Let me explain.

What is “in” one week is usually

.. “out" the next. Fashion is constantly

changing. If you went out and bought
an expensive, pink Don Johnson
jacket this summer, and then wear it
to a formal event this fall — don’t mind
the snickers. lt’s not that the jacket or
suit wasn't expensive or of good quali-
ty, it's just plain wrong for the
occasion.

Don has great style, but it's his style.
lt’s a good rule not to be trendy or
always wear the “latest.” There are a

few standard items that should be a '

part of every man's wardrobe, and with
these you'll never go wrong.

 

ty of grunts and groans (the last 20
minutes of the film were devoted to
these alone).

“Commando" isn't the kind of movie
that demands any thought. It's not
complicated in the least, especially the
dialogue. If anything, it’s slightly
bizarre.

all dressed   up;

A good quality blue blazer is a must.
From this simple base, many hand-
some outfits can be assembled. The
easiest combination is grey pants, a
white shirt, and a silk tie. This is still
a pretty broad description, and pur-
posely so. There is still a lot of room
to add your own flair into this ensem-
ble, but again, don’t be trendy.

Good clothes cost good money. But,
it's better to invest in quality clothing
that can be worn for years, than to buy
trendy clothes you may just wear once.
Times change, but classics don't. One
more point about clothing is the fabric
of which it's constructed. Try to keep
to natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk).
They look better and are more comfor-
table to wear than sythetics.

One final subject to address — in- ‘

terview wear. There are three rules
governing interview attire: GREY,
GFlEY,GFlEY. Invest in a grey suit and
black shoes. To get a “real” job, you
have to dress like a “real" person. Too
bad.  .

So, remember, when you have to
dress’ up for a special occasion:

— Avoid trendy clothing.
— Stay with natural fibers.
— Invest in classic outfits.

RATI‘/BON JOVI
Civic Arena
Dec. 2, 1985

Have you ever wondered if Rattand

' , Bon Jovi were as good live as they are

in the studio and on the tube? Well,
trouble yourself no more. The verdict
is in: No.

Bon Jovi, for starters, performs like
the typical opening act — badly.
Before playing any of their “good”
songs, they managed to bore all
non-15-year-old-and-under girls (who
were too busy screaming to realize that
the group on-stage really had very lit-
tle talent) with an endless string of
noise pollution. Then, on the premise

Baby

Young's Helen is hardly more than a
frustrated, manipulative, loud-mouthed
bitch. These were two of the best por-
trayals of incompetence I've ever
seen.

Anyway, the only decision they
make about this baby is an arbitrary
one: Since it has to be one or the other,
they decide that it's a girl and that her
name will be Daisy. It seems they're
too polite to ﬁnd out for sure, which is

that the crowd was not “warmed up”
enough, they brought forth their lead
guitarist and had him make as much
noise as he possibly could. The only
group I've ever seen do a worse job is
Loudness.

The lights went back on to signal
that the torture session was over, and
shortly the audience would be able to
hear a good group. Unfortunately, this
was not to be the case, as Ratt put on
a show that could not have been more
lackluster.

The reason their show was so bad
may have been because this was their
first experience as a headlining act,
and they were not quite sure what they
were supposed to do. However, they
had learned that most good groups

beside the fact that Daisy is actually a
normal, healthy boy — at least he
could be. It isn't until the age of twelve
that he discovers his parents’ mistake.
You can imagine the adjustments and
maladjustments he went through!
Throughout childhood, all Daisy
does is either pretend tobe inanimate
objects or race to jump in front of
crosstown buses. One minute mo-
tionless, the next you can't keep up

have an interesting stage setup and
Ratt had one of the best I have ever
seen. But a good, stage cannot turn a
bland concert performance into a good
show — and good showmen were
what was needed, not just performers.

Another factor contributing to the
dismalness of the show was the sound,
the most important factor of all. The
engineers who were working the mix-
ing board were obviously not paying at-
tention to the concert, or they would
have realized that Stephen Pearcy’s
normal screaming voice was at a pitch
resembling a near constant shriek that
could easily have been mixed out.
Another problem with the sound was
in the band's choice to use the echo

lot to say about a lot of social issues
in contemporary America. With a satire
that bites, he tears into everything from
public education and modern religion
to drug abuse and psychiatric care.
Even though Daisy doesn’t actually
appear before the second act, the play
is really all about how he deals with
himself as a product of this insane en-
vironment. The role is likely to be the
most demanding in the play because
not only is he the least connected to
the frivolity of his surroundings, but he
also must find the means to emerge
from it all in some realistic and,

stage

effect in every other song, ruining
many of their better numbers as well
as wearing down the crowd's patience.
Ratt’s selection of songs was also a
bit strange. Instead of playing a large
amount from their Out Of The Cellar
album (their best), they concentrated
on trying to sell their newest and oldest
albums Invasion Of Your Privacy and
Ram, respectively.
The next time Ratt comes to Pitts-
burgh, it might be a better idea for
them to play the Syria Mosque instead
of the Civic Arena — at least at the
' Mosque they might be able to fill all the
seats.

apparently has found that precision.
We can laugh, but we can't take it
lightly.

The other two cast members, Kate

multiple roles, were both a scream to

directing. Never has City Theater Com-

Pittsburgh will play host to three in-

piano virtuosity designed to sate even
the most famished of musical
appetites.

Jeffrey Siegel will perform with the

Pittsburgh Symphony at Heinz Hall Fri- ,

Sunday, Oct. 13 at 2:30 p.m. Siegel
will play Mozart’s Piano Concerto in A

He has performed with all the major
American orchestras and has ap-
peared in the major musical capitals of
Europe as well. Recent highlights have

come to finding my favorite coaster.
The Cyclone is a devastating mass of
curves and hills which you travel at
frightening speeds. But my old Coney
Island favorite no longer holds the top
spot on my list, for I have reached a
new state of awareness: last summer
I found the “ultimate coaster.”

Cincinnati, Ohio — about a five-hour
drive from Pittsburgh — was my

destination for this ride. There I visited .

the giant Kings’ Island theme park, a
summer adventureland that spreads
for miles into the quiet, serene — and
unbelievably hot — -southern Ohio
countryside. I went to Kings’ Island for
one reason: I had to see for myself if
the ride I had heard so much about
was as ferocious as everyone said. I
went to tame The Beast. ..

The Beast is no ordinary‘ “roller”

coaster. For starters, you cannot see
much of the ride because the tracks

In addition to his concerto repertoire,
Siegel also performs a solo repertoire

- that ranges from Bach to Barber. Sum-
_mer festival appearances have includ-

ed the Hollywood Bowl, Ravinia,
Blossom, Robin Hood Dell, Caramoor,
Grant Park and Aspen. He has been

p.m.. at the Morris Kaufmann
Auditorium, 315 S. Bellefield Ave., in

and will feature Horatio Gutierrez.
Gutierrez was born in Cuba and has
appeared with the Havana Symphony
Orchestra at the early age of 11. He
has appeared with every major
American symphony orchestra and

are woven through a thick forest and

disappear into a far-off valley. Boar-
ding the train (which resembles a line
of mining cars), you see only * the
loading platform’ and the first long, high
hill of your journey. The theme of this
ride is about an abandoned mine
which was forced to close down many
years ago because of a mysterious un-
controllable animal that stalks the
area. -
ln-sizing up the adventure at hand,
you feel more than a mild twinge of
fright, as if there -were actually a horri-

ble, untamed creature out in those hills '

somewhere. Yet, with trepidation, you
get in line‘. There is aconsiderable
wait, perhaps as long as an hour, to
meet the Beast — but it’s worth it.
Once in the train car with a steel lap
bar holding your legs tightly and a

- pretzel of straps over your. arms and

chest, you slowly begin the climb up

audiences, Gutierrez has appeared at

Center and with the Guarneri Quartet
and the New. York Y Chamber
Orchestra.

The concert will open the Y Music

Haydn’s Sonata in C Major,
Schumann's Fantasie in C Major,
Rave|'s Gaspard de la, Nuit and two
pieces by Liszt, Sonetta del Petrarca
and Mephisto Waltz. Although no stu-

to students for only $39. Call 521-8010

The third and last concert of the

you reach the top arid look down into
the deep dark valley which lies below,
your heart begins to pound. Even the,
most experienced and hardened-in-
dividual cannot restrain himself from

- gasping with fright when he sees he is

going to drop 145 feet, the longest ver-
tical drop on any coaster in the world,
and then be swallowed by a pitch dark,
underground tunnel. 1

Yet the thrill has barely begun, for ‘
the train races down the hill with a
startling, sudden swiftness, an ac-
celerating rate and speed that you are
not expecting, much like the sensation
of driving a car at a high speed and try-
ing to hit the brakes, only to find that
there are none.

It's then that you fully discover that
this train has become a writhing
monster that's determiined to carry

The_Pitt News - October 11, 1985

Give me meaningful lyrical content or give me jazz

By Bob Travers

The screaming began as soon as
the doors were open, and thousands
of fans — mostly female teen-agers —
filled the Civic Arena that snowy
February night. The lights were still up,
but that small fact didn't matter to the
most die-hard Durannies. For them,
the mere idea of being in the same
building as their idols was enough to
lose control of their vocal chords.

When the arena darkened and the
red curtain pulled back to reveal Duran
Duran, the noise had reached such a
point that the music could barely be
heard above the now frantic
screaming.

Yes, I know, to all of you intellectuals
out there, Duran Duran is “mere fluff’
and “the musical equivalent of a Big
Mac" and just oh so far below your
highbrow tastes. I can just see you all
now reading this andlistening to the
new Talking Heads album which you
like so much because, well, it's‘ about
something. David Byrne has a
message (Oh, boy, a messagel). If

we're lucky, real lucky, maybe some
group will come along and tell us that
war is a bad thing (Oh, my!) or Reagan
is a jerk (Oh, my!).

Yes, I know, if it doesn't say
something about South Africa or
unemployment or injustice, it just isn't
any good and somebody as smart as
you —- hey, you're well-read —- would
never listen to a song called “Girls On
Film” or “The Fleflex.” No, your mot-
to is “Give me relevant, lyrical content
or give me jazz.”

With your arrogant attitude, you
have no room to criticize any 14-year-
old girl who refuses to listen to your
Crosby, Stills and Nash album
because David Crosby weighs as
much as a Chrysler K car. You refuse
to listen to her Duran Duran and
Wham! albums because the guys in
those groups wear make-up (So much
for your intellectual tolerance). Your at-
titude is the same as hers: You both
close your ears because of some
preconception.

But wait a minute, you say, how"

could George Michael ever convey a
real feeling? He's a cartoon, a tan god

with shining teeth. George Michael
may not be a guy we can all relate to,
but neither is Bono or David Byrne or
Elvis Costello. I rarely have any idea
what it is these groups are trying to
say.

Anybody who has ever heard Duran
Duran’s “The Seventh Stranger" and
“Save A Prayer” or Spandau Ballet's
“True” knows that these Pretty Boy
dummies are very capable of writing a
ballad that anyone can understand.
Has anyone ever felt the sentiment in
the Thompson Twins’ “Hold Me
Now”? How about your last romance
— wasn't it like that song? (I thought
so.) And I know we can all understand
a song about a war in Ireland a lot bet-

ter than we can “Hold Me Now.” Isn't.

that right, intellectuals? But seriously,
what do you know about war except
what you see on TV? Whether or not
you want to believe it, you are a lot
more like Simon LeBon than lik_e_ B_ono.

Let's talk about one of your favorite
topics — cultural importance. Did it
ever occur to you that the most impor-
tant band culturally in the 1980s has
been Culture Club? While Boy George

may be commercial, the fact _i,_s,__th'a’¢ it;
the English new wave bands, which

use video as prominently as guitars,

that are really changing people's

minds. David Byrne can sit in his ivory

tower forever and wail about in-

tolerance, but what is he doing about

it? Would he ever have the courage —

yes, courage — to dress like Boy

George?

It is a tribute to the accessibility of
his music that Boy George has
become a given. In his own way, Boy
George was as radical as the the Sex
Pistols or any other punk band. He did
nothing more than get the American

-public at large to accept him on his

own terms, by his rules.

These groups — Duran Duran,
Whaml, Thompson Twins, Spandau
Ballet — are simply a lot more fun. If
you ever have a party and don't know
who to invite, go with the Durannies.
The conversation’ may not be as
stimulating, but you won't be bored by
nine with a bunch of intellectuals go-
ing on endlessly about how hopeless
it all is. Let's face it — Pretty Boys have
more fun.

The Pitt News - October 11, 1985

Uphill battle

Kramer

makes

pitch for success

North Carolina State head coach
Tom Reed knew, following last year’s
3-8 season, that 1985 was not going to
get much easier. It hasn’t.' The
Wolfpack is 1-4 thus far this season,
not much better than a year ago.

“We’re a team that has been strug-
gling for identity,” said Reed.“We’re
trying to get better, trying to improve.”

Although the record may not be im-
proving, the performance of the team
has. Last week against a tough
Maryland team, the Wolfpack
squandered an early lead and wound up
losing 31-17, but in that game, a leader
emerged. Quarterback Erik Kramer, a
junior college transfer from Pierce

(California) Junior College, ducked the“

Maryland pass rush most of the game
and threw for 324 yards. Kramer com-

pleted 28 of 43 passes with no intercep- '

tions. That was good enough for a
school passing record. Reed knows he
has a good quarterback, but Kramer
has been taking his toll on the other
skill positions.

“One of the problems Erik has
had,” noted Reed, “is that he breaks
every reciever’s hands that we have.
(Flanker) Nasrallah Worthen has two
broken bones in his hand. (Split end)
Danny Peebles has a broken thumb,
andFrank1-Iarrishasabrokenthumb.”

Other than taking his toll on the
recieving corps, Reed has been happy
with the performance of Kramer.

_ “Erik has done a good job for us,”
said Reed.“He throws the ball well,
he’s fairly mobile, he’s extremely m-
telligent and he seems to be getting bet-
ter with each ga'me.”

There will be no surprises on Satur-

‘ day. North Carolina State will come

out throwing.

As I see it

“We plan to throw the ball to move
it,” said Reed. “The thing that con-
cerns me is that we haven't been able
to protect our passer.”

That is no secret. Kramer has already
been thrown for 140 yards in losses.
Pitt may spend a great deal of time in
the North Carolina State offensive
backﬁeld. Pitt’s junior defensive end
Tony Woods is coming off perhaps his
ﬁnest performance in a Panther
uniform. Woods leads a defense that
-is allowing only 1.9 yards per carry
rushing to its opponents.

“We are not going to allow
our players to look
ahead...”

—Foge Fazio

“Pitt is exactly like Maryland in
many ways,” noted Reed, referring to
the Wolfpack’s previous opponent. ‘ ‘I
think Tony Woods, as I look at the Pitt
defense, may be the best defensive
player that we will play against all
y ear]!

Reed added, “What really impresses
me about Pitt’s defense is thedefensive
linemen," (Bob) Buczkowski and those
guys up front. What they do is make
all the hits up front. The linebackers
are very good football players, but they
do not have as many tackles as the
linemen. That tells me that the linemen
are very good football players.”

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio watched
his team put together its most im-
pressive performance of the year
against South Carolina last week. By ‘
no means does he intend on letting his -

Sports

Erik Kramer

squad suffer a letdown against North
Carolina State. -

‘‘I warned our squad. One thing is
for sure, they cannot take North
Carolina State lightly,” said Fazio.
“They are a very aggressive football
team, and naturally for them to come
up here and get a victory would be
outstanding for them.”

Pitt is looking for their second con-
secutive victory. Should Pitt win, it will
be only the second time that Pitt has
won two games in a row since 1983,
the same year Pitt had its last bowl
game trip. '

“This is ateamwecannottakelight-
ly,” noted Fazio again. “We have our
work cut out for us. We're just going
to have to go out there and play with
the same emotions that we did last
week.” Fazio added, “We're not go-
ing to allow our players to look ahead
or think that this is a cupcake team,
because it isn’t. I told them if it's a cup-
cake team and you believe that, you go
out and don’t play well, you’ll see how
fast you'll become a cupcake.”

Those are strong words from a coach
whose team is coming of a 35-point
victory, but then again, those are wortls
from a coach who is coming off, like
Reed, a disappointing season. It’s been
an uphill battle for both but Reed’s hill
has been a little steeper.

Nelson and DeVera shine

Lady Panthers ,

nipped by Rock   s

The Lady Panther tennis team, in
quest of their second consecutive win-
ning season, dropped a hard-fought 6-3
decision at Slippery Rock on Wednes-
day, bringing the team’s record to 6-5
with two key matches remaining.

Sophomores Carrie De Vera and
Stephanie Nelson provided the spark
for the Lady Panthers as the team
challenged Slippery Rock right down
to the end. De Vera arid_ Nelson both
earned victories in their singles matches
at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, and
then teamed up to take a win at No. 2
doubles. All three matches were won
in straight sets.

Coach George Dieffenbach is elated
over the performance of these two
young players. ‘ ‘Carrie and Stephanie
deserve a lot of credit. They’ve been
very consistent and have really been the
heart of our line-up.”

Dieffenbach was also very pleased
with the effort of the entire team despite
the loss. “There was a lot of pressure
on them, being down 4-2 going into
doubles,” , Dieffenbach said. “But
everyone tried hard and fought hard the
whole way. The match was well within
reach.” A _

Next up for Coach Die‘ffenbach’s

squad is a critical match against West
Liberty College, a team that lost to
Slippery Rock by an identical 6-3
margin.
“It will really be important for us to
do well against a team that we’re even
with "so we can gain some conﬁdence
going in to face West Virginia,‘ ’ Dief-
fenbach added. “Also if we win, we’re
guaranteed a winning season, simple as
that. ”

Coach Dieffenbach added that ad-
mission will be free for the home ﬁnale

and that the team would appreciate the
support of some enthusiastic fans. This
willbeyoiirlastchancetoseetheteam

held at Trees courts at 3 p.m. today.

Dodgers outlast Cardinals

Los Angeles (UPI)--The Los Angeles
Dodgers whipped the St. Louis Car-
dinals last night, 8-2, to take a 2-0 lead

in the best of seven National League —

Championship Series. Righthander
Orel Hershiser gave up eight hits and

went the distance for the Dodgers. _

By Jim Brueckner T

Patrick Ewing’s $30 million contract is an absolute travesty

*If I were the ,owner of the NBA’s
New York Knicks, 1 would have called
a press conference and said this, ‘ ‘We
are sorry to say that the career of
Patrick Ewing is ofﬁcially over due to
insanity.” His contract is the greatest

travesty in all of sports history. No, I'm »

not exaggerating.

*1 hate it when people watch hockey
just for the ﬁghts. But not watching it
just because of the ﬁghts is far worse.

*Slashing is worse than ﬁghting.
People can be seriously hurt by some
goon swinging a stick. The worst thing
that a player suffers in 99 out of 100'
ﬁghts is a bruised ego.

*1 love Australian football on ESPN.
If you have cable, give this a try next
season.

*The brushback pitch has no place

in baseball. If you’re not talented -

enough to succeed without it, leave the
mound. ,. *

  

*Ever notice how many late hits are
not called in college and pro football?

*All winners are geniuses.

*1 can't believe how some quarter-
backs can exercise such stupidity dur-
ing the two-minute drill.

*Why doesn’t Chuck Noll have
Mark Malone try to set up Gary Ander-
son whenever the Steelers get the ball
with just a few seconds left in the half?
If they make it to the 50-yard line, it
becomes a 67-yard ﬁeld goal attempt.
Why not give him a shot, considering
how many games are decided by three
or less points? He has the range.

*1 like Joe Namath as a color

commentator.

' *If the NFL wants to speed up play,

why don’t they adopt the 25-second

 

of how authentic pro
wrestling is (who cares), it's hysterical.
I can’t explain it, but I can’t resist lik-
ing Rowdy Roddy Piper. Making Jesse
‘ ‘The Body’ ’ Ventura a color commen-
tator was a brilliant move. But my
favorite wrestler is still George “The
Animal” Steele.

*Most people don’t, but I love
baseball games that end up 1-0 or 2-1.

*The best thing that the, NHL ever
did was instituting overtime into the
regular season. 

*Some people are complaining that
Mary Lou Retton is sponging off of the
Olympics with her commercials, book
andwheatiescover, butlthinkthatshe
deserves it. She is the ﬁnest female
athlete in the world today. Sorry,
Martina.

*Wayne Gretzky is the greatest
hockey player alive. But he’s not God.
He makes mistakes like every other
player and plays on a team with some
highly underrated teammates.

*Only 1,072 days until the opening
ceremonies in Korea. .

*One ﬁght that I would love to have
ringside seats for is the Jack Dempsey
vs. Rocky Marciano match in the
Roman Coliseum.

*1 wonder what our luge team will
be like_ in Calgary.

*If I could have the talent to be an
Olympic competitor in any sport, 1
would be a downhill skier.

*1 despise auto racing. When are
they going to ban this farce of a sport
or at least quit covering it on TV? I hate
having to sit through the Wide World
of Sports because I’m waiting for some
real sport later in the broadcast.

*Please get rid of the designated
hitter!

*Mike Lang (voice of the Penguins)
is by far the best hockey armouncer I
have ever heard.

*1 prefer good defense to good of-
fense in any sport.

 

j .

*My personal favorite in baseball is
when an outﬁelder throws someone out
at the plate.

*Double plays are as picturesque as
any ballet.

*Hank Strain and John Madden are
the two best color men in" pro football.
Terry Bradshaw will be in their class
before long.

*1'll never understand why more
baseball players don’t e lay the head-
ﬁrst slide. It gets you ere two full
strides earlier.

pip’...-no-a-p

<AI ¢/11>

 

*Is' there anything more automatic
than Marcus Allen over the top from
the one-yard line? '

*1 would love to travel to Japan and
spend two, maybe three weeks watch-
mg Japanese baseball. Considering that
Pete Rose is worshipped every time he
plays exhibitions over there, I can well
imagine the type of play that I would
see. Also, the few pictures of the
stadiums I have seen are beautiful.

*Basketball referees should “let
them play.”

*1 can’t wait for college basketball V
to start so that I can hear Al McGuire '

again.

*1 admire a well-placed bunt single.

*1 don’t know why, but I like the
way hockey has all those teams in the
Stanley Cup Playoffs. _

*College basketball needs a shot
clock (I vote for 30 seconds). ’

*1 love outdoor soccer on the inter-
national level. Can't wait for the World
Cup.

 

*College football has two gems in A , 1.

Keith Jackson and Lindsey Nelson, the
best play-by-play announcers in ALL of
football.

*He who doubts has already lost.

*The NHL has the worst refereeing
in sports.

*1 hate the National Anthem. I’ve
always liked “America the Beautiful”
better. A

*Canada has the best of all anthems.
“Oh Canada” is a song ﬁlled with
elegance and class.

*1 am in awe of cross-country skiers
who compete. Incredible endurance!
For those who do it has a hobby, it
must be the most beautiful of all
sports-hobbies.

*Sportsworld’s Survival of the Fit-
test competition is better than the
decathlon for testing all-around
athleticism.

*1 wish the players would. speed up
baseball.

*The Penquins look legitimately
promising. Look for Mario Lemieux to
become the second best player in the
NFL this year.

*1 am amazed by the high percentage
of alley-oops in basketball that actual-
ly work.

*1 miss the end zone dances of the
NFL. 1 wish everyone would make up
their mind. Is this business or a game?
I prefer a game. -

*Featherweight Champion Barry
McGuigan is a throwback, a ferocious
body puncher. '

*Something I'd like to see more of:
I love to watch the Russians play
hockey.-

*Remember who told you this: No
matter what you ’ve read, Billy Martin
will be the next Pirate manager. After
the drug scandal, -we». need, ‘at

. disciplinarian to retain the fans ’ trust.

hosts
Bowling
Green

By Kelly Butt
Staff Writer

It’s a weekend for Homecom-
ings. The Lady Panthers will play
host to Bowling Green in Trees
Hall immediately following the Pitt-
N.C. State game tomorrow in con-
junction with the Homecoming ac-

tivities. Coach Shelton Collier is
hoping for a large turnout. This
particular game will showcase Pan-
ther volleyball ’85 and hopefully in-
terest more people in Pitt’s pro-
gram. The Pitt-Bowling Green
game provides the Lady Panthers
with one ﬁnal game before playing
in the preliminary match between
the United States and Japan Oct. 17
at Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House.
Coach Collier is looking for this to
be the match to regroup.

“We’ve had some good practices
this week and we should be up for

4 the challenge,” said Collier. “Our
level of competition ought to be
considerably raised because we’ve
suffered a cycle of disappointing
losses.”

_Going into the game with a 17-5
record, the Lady Panthers will be
facing a much improved, well-
coached BG team. Under the
guidance of Coach Denise Van De
Valle, BG should prove to be an ex-
citing team to watch. They have
two players in their roster whom
Pitt tried to recruit. Because the
Lady Panthers are so highly regard-
ed regionally and nationally, it
would be a feather in BG’s cap to
walk off the court with the victory.
However, with the home court ad-
vantage, Pitt should respond better
to the game situation.

Another advantage, yet to be pro-
ven, is the Lady Panther starting
line-up. Coach Collier remarked,
‘ ‘I really don’t know how Bowling
Green will prepare for us. We have
11 players on our roster and have
yet to set the starting line-up for the
game Saturday. In the past, we
weren’t playing as strongly as we
could have. Now, we’re looking for
the best combination to put on the
court. This should provide a lot of
opportunities for most of our team
to play. We’ve made a lot of pro-
gress. Although the line-up is still
unsettled, we should be ready for
the homestretch this weeken .”

Coming off a loss to tough arch-
rival Penn State and a victory over
Big East competitor Georgetown,
the Lady Panthers need to win to
keep up their conﬁdence. And with
Georgetown on their heels in the ti-
tle race, Pitt has more than a little
incentive to fuel their cause. Coach
Collier thinks that this game will
“help us gain more conﬁdence. We
should have some fun playing this
game at home.” After all, it is
Homecoming.

The USA Women's National ‘

Volleyball team will take on the
Japanese National team on Oct. 17
at the Field House. Tickets are
$4.50, $6.50 and $8.50 and are
selling rapidly. An expected crowd
of 4,000 should be on hand to
watch the matches. In the
preliminary round, Pitt will match
playing skills with league threat
Providence at 6:30. The National
A teams take to the court at 8:30 in
Fitzgerald Field House. Penn State
will invade Panther territory Friday

Oct. 18, at 7 p.m. Pitt will face

Georgetown on Saturday.

A celebration of tradition with a twist I

It has been dubbed as a celebration
of tradition — a time to reminisce the
good times for Pitt fans, time for alum-
ni to be proud to have once been a
Panther.

Four Panther home football games
were designated jersey days. The
jerseys to be given away will bear the
numbers of four recent Pitt greats. The
Pitt Media Guide displays these four
and other Panther greats on its cover.

With this being Homecoming
weekend and all the hoopla this season
about the tradition, one tends to
ponder, thinking of all these great
times.

Maybe on Tony Dorsett Jersey Day,
the shirt should have come in pieces.
After all, it seemed like every time
Dorsett carried the ball, he would slip
away from would-be defenders, helped
slightly by his tear-away jersey. Fans
would receive a Bill Fralic jersey one

 

play at home football games, an-

 

c‘: 1985 Miller Brewing Co., Milwaukee. WI

Friends don’t letufriehds drive drunk.

size smaller than they needed. That
way their muscles would pop out just
like Fralic’s did. Dan Marino and
Hugh Green jerseys are going to be
given out this year, too.

All four were Heisman Trophy can-
didates, and although only Dorsett won
the prestigious award, they all have left
impressions on all Panther fans.

Who could forget Marino connecting
with John Brown in the 1982 Sugar
Bowl producing a last-second Panther
win over Georgia 24-20? And Fralic
leading the way for former tailback Joe
McCall to a big touchdown in a 1983

.win over Notre Dame at South Bend?

Fralic single-handedly knocked down
four Irish defenders on the play.
Hugh Green was a force on the Pitt
defensive line since he was recruited
by, yes, Foge Fazio from Natchez,
Miss. , in 1977. It seemed like on every

 

nouncer Roger Houston would ‘say,
“tackled by number 99 — Huuuuugh
Greeeeeeen.” Green’s number was a
force in itself. One who shares the
same number as a Wayne Gretzky is
destined for greatness. ‘

Speaking of greatness, it’s puzzling
to think about all the records Dorsett
set while a Panther. In 1976, the na-
tional championship year, Dorsett
rushed for 2,150 yards. He rushed for
6,526 in his career. Only nine times in
his 47-game career at Pitt would he not
ﬁnish with at least 100 yards rushing
in a game. But he did have nine games
with at least 200 yards. Dorsett’s best
game, however, came in 1975' in a
34-20 win over Notre Dame where he
dazzled and twisted for an unbelievable
303 yards.

Panther fans, we have been blessed.
These are only four of the great ones.
Since 1973 when Dorsett arrived, Pitt

has racked up 105‘victories to only 37
defeats with ﬁve ties. ‘_

Then there are the days before
Dorsett, where Pitt won another eight
national championships. Only ﬁve
teams have claimed the No. 1 ranking
more often than Pitt.

The days could be over where a few
teams dominate college football like
Notre Dame, Alabama, Pitt, Penn State
and others have done in the past. But
that doesn’t mean the Panthers won't
continue ﬁelding excellent teams
season in and out. Parity in college is
here and is here to stay. We can only
savor these memories where Pitt could
and would dominate almost every
game. It indeed calls for a celebration.

The current Panther squad has been
playing some good football of late, with

a 2-2-1 record, a record that could be _

much better with any luck.
Let’s call it a time to rejoice over the
present and past Panthers.
