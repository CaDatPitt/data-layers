help University of Pittsburgh
students participate in ‘the
Semester at Sea Program. Aug-
mentation grants enable a stu-
dent to pay only the cost of Pitt
tuition and room and board; the
remainder of the Semester at Sea
program fee is waived". Based on
academic performance and
financial need, the augmenta-
tion grants enable Pitt students

the-world learning experience
at the same cost as a term in
residence at Pitt.

Students interested in apply-
ing for an augmentation grant
for the Fall ’82 voyage must

Schen/ey Farms  

Schenley Farms, an upper
middle class neighborhood bor_-
V dering Pitt’s campus, was rec-
" kommended for designation as

an historic district this week by
‘the City Planning Commis-
sion.

The commission, acting on a
recommendation from the His-
toric Review Commission, has
sent along its recommendation
to City Council, which has final
approval of the designation.

The Schenley Farms Civic
Association, which represents
the residents of the area, had
also wanted the parking lots
behind the Syria Mosque and
the Masonic Temple to be
included in the historic district.

 By including those districts, a
‘proposed hotel-and-condo-
minium complex, which the
residents oppose, .might have
been stalled.

-During the 19605, a group of
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology scientists developed jellied
gasoline, or napalm, which the
U.S. then used in the Vietnam air
war. When the scientists were asked
why they had done this, they re-
plied that how_ the napalm was
‘used wasn’t their responsibility-
their job was to produce it.

“There is nojustification for this
type of attitude,” said Seth Chaik-

Professor
Discusses
History Of‘   r
Desegregation

By JEFF RUSSELL

Freedom of choice in desegrega-
tion planning doesn’t work
because “whites rarely choose to
send their children to predomi-

nately black schools,” Pitt educa- F

tion professor Eugene Lincoln said
yesterday.

Lincoln told an Honors Pro-
gram Noontime Lecture Series
audience that courts want schools
to "do what they can in order to
achieve desegregation, but that the
courts would also like to see a’uni-
tary system of desegregation.

He said the courts never ruled
that busing was the only way to
desegregate schools.

“Contrary to popular opinion,
busing is not mandatory to
achieve desegregation,” Lincoln
said. “The courts have allowed
busing but have not mandated it.”

Lincoln also analyzed the Wood-
land Hills desegregation case.
Woodland Hills School district
was formed as the result of a court-
ordered merger of the former Chur-
chill, Turtle Creek, Swissvale area
and General Braddock area school
districts.

Lincoln said Federal District
Gerald Weber’s decision to merge
the districts was a “proper” one,
and that “there was precedence for
the order.”

The Woodland Hills Case has
been appealed twice. Last Monday,
the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals
heard the case and decided against
the appeal to void the merger.

Lincoln said that “there is only
one place to go” for the appeals——
the Supreme Court. He said that
although he thinks there is no
merit to the appeal, he believes the
Supreme Court will hear the case.

“It (the Woodland Hills case) is
one of the biggest and most impor-
tant cases," he said.

Lincoln also explained the his-
tory Ebehind desegregation rulings.

chology. And he believes that this
is not an isolated incident. “There
used to be a moral and intellectual
standard in the university. Now
both students and faculty have lost
the moral context.”

Chaiklin plans to organize a stu-
dent forum for the discussion of
these issues. “I want to raise these
issues in the context of the univer-
sity,” he said. “It’s an important

thirlg for people to think about.”

He was challenged to find his

hidden paycheck.

Kreskin, the acclaimed men-
talist, walked around David
Lawrence Auditorium with a
member of the audience trailing
behind him, attached by a white
handkerchief.

The person was thinking
about where the check was hid-
den. Using the oerson's
thoughts, Kreskin located his
paycheck in ‘a most unusual
place—inside a camera part.

“This is the most ingeniously
hidden check ever,” he
exclaims.

Kreskin stunned the standing room only audience in David Lawrence Auditorium

Kreskin Amazes Audience

Kreskin performed this and
other feats of mental magic
before a standing room only
crowd last night. The event was
sponsored by The Pitt Program
Council.

During the course of the
night, * Kreskin involved the
audience in his act. He ran-
domly picked out people, read
their thoughts, told them the
names of their friends, what
they were thinking about, and
rattled off phone numbers.

Kreskin’s final act of the
night was to take volunteers
onto the stage, first to make
their fingers stick at a spread

position, then to make their
eyelids stay shut.

He then told the volunteers
that it was cold on the stage and
the audience actually witnessed
them shake and shiver. Kreskin
told them of a great heat wave
and the volunteers started shed-
ding clothing.

To yet further mesmerize the
crowd, Kreskin‘ outdid himself
by making the volunteers
believe that a girl standing on
the stage was invisible.

Kreskin received a standing
ovation from an appreciative
Pitt audience after his final
statement of the evening;

“I love my work.”

Every GambIer’s F ondest

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Bob Robinson
Housing Ofﬁce

This week many residents
may have been asking them-
selves, “Where is Nick Perry
now that we need him?”

The Housing and Food Ser-
vice Office has been conducting
its annual resident lottery to
determine which lucky students
will be able to secure a dorm
room for next fall.

According to Bob Robinson,
administrative specialist for the
office, the system that the uni-
versity practices is the most
effective. Robinson said he has
compared Pitt’s system with
other universities and found
that Pitt’s was the best.

Pitt has 4200 residents in 11
separate housing units. Accord-
ing to Robinson, there are 1,188
beds available to continuing
undergraduates 1,000 beds for
females and 888 beds for males.
That number is based on the

man and new students on a first
come, first served basis.

If a student wants to continue
living in the dorms, there is a
certain procedure he or she
must follow. The resident goes
to the place in which the lottery
is held and fills out a verifica-
tion form.

Males and females then check

in separately to housing offi-.

cials to insure their names are
on the current roster of resident
students.

After the verification card is
dated and initialed, the student
goes to the appropriate bowl to
pick a number. There is a bowl
for males and a bowl for
females.

The females who pick
numbers between one and 'l,000
will be certain to get a room
next fall. Males who pick
numbers between one and 888
will have a room. Students who
pick higher numbers are placed
on a waiting list.

Robinson said that even

_ though a student may n-ot pick a

number in the “good range,”
there is still a chance he or she
may get a room.

He said that traditionally all

“If there were 200 numbers in
the good range not picked, for
example, the good range moves
up to l200,” Robinson said.

He said that number keeps
rising if the “good range”
numbers are not picked. In the
past, Robinson said, the
number for female residents has
reached 1500. He did not say,
however, that it may happen
again this year. I

The number is also affected

ting their $100 deposit and
application in on time, and
other factors, Robinson said.

The current lottery system is
in its fourth year at Pitt. Prior to
that, the distribution of rooms
was done on a first come. firse
served basis. Robinson, who 
was an undergraduate at Pitt I
during that time, said that Pitt’s
current way is the best he knows
of.

In the past, he said, the hous-
ing office would announce the
date when the applications
would be distributed in the resi-
dent's mailboxes. He said ever-
yone would get an application
and the first 2,600 students to
submit their applications
would get the rooms. Robinson
said this way was unfair.

Besides that fact, Robinson

Robinson said because of the

“First come, first served is
tough, but luck is another
thing,” she said. .

Through the three years that
Pecuch drew, she said she tried
to take it with a light attitude.

“It's best if you don’t worry
about it,” she said. “The
numbers do jump over the
summer, so don’t panic.”

Pecuch advises freshman
especially not to worry about
the system, And she tells older
students who may be thinking
of getting an apartment to draw
anyway, because their minds
might change. Most of all, she
said, don’t dwell on it if a “good
range” number is not picked.

“If people worry about it
daily, it’s hard for them to cope

with the rest of the term,"
Pecuch said.

Pecuch said one of the hard-
est parts for a freshman going
through the lottery is the fric-

Lincoln said, “blacks could not

couldn’t teach in black schools."
In 1954, however, the Supreme
Court reversed the Plessy decison.
In the famous case of Brown v. The

Court said that public schools

The l960’s conjure up images
of long-haired rebellious stu-

Vietnam war, the president’s

thing that vaguely resembled
“the establishment.”

In the ’80s, these images have
been replaced by alligator
shirts, short haircuts, and prac-
tical outlooks. Students worry

less about hypocrisy and more
about jobs.

Perhaps its the tight job
market, then, that caused the
overwhelming response to Cen-

recruitment on campus last
month.

The CIA was looking for stu-

quality of life.”

For example, said Chaiklin,
much of the funding for physics
research is provided by the Defense
Department. Physics students are
faced with using theirknowledge
“to build a better bomb,” he said.

They should ask themselves
“What are my responsibilities as
physicists? There is the same sort of
problems in the humanities—in
history, for example,” Chaiklin
said.

In addition to workshops, sym-
posia and research and reading’
groups, Chaiklin hopes the foru

“ﬁr

can sponsor a lecture series. “Td I

like to have people from the uni-
versity who have affected public
policy to talk about their personal
experiences,” he said. “Many get
involved by accident.” This will be
effective “in demystifying public
policy,” Chaiklin states, because
many students do not believe that

Chaiklin’s goals for the forum
are “to be able to hear others and to
stimulate students to think about
these topics...I’ve been warned

about student apathy, but I’m not

tions aren't simple and there’s
thinking

nothing wrong with
about them.”

‘Historical’
Schenley Farms

The name Schenley Farms implies suburban coziness
and rural serenity, punctuated by rolling green hills,
ranch—style homes and cattle grazing in the distance. In
reality, however, Schenley Farms is an upper-middle class
Oakland neighborhood bordering Pitt’s campus. Unfor-
tunately, the only hills that can be seen are the Hill District
and Squirrel Hill, and there aren’t any cattle, unless one
happens to step into the hourly stampede that occurs
between Pitt’s classes. I . :

Schenley Farms is also involved in a heated, lingering
dispute with a Pittsburgh developer who proposes to
build a hotel-and-condominium complex next door to the
neighborhood behind the Syria Mosque and Masonic
Temple. ' » * '

And as soon as the complex moves in, the residents
complain, there goes the neighborhood.

By the good graces of the city Planning Commission
and the Historic Review Commission, Schenley Farms
received preliminary designation this week as a historic
district. When final approval is granted by City Council,
Schenley Farm’s historic status will mean that any poten-
tial development in the area will need approval from the
Historic Review Commission.

But while Schenley Farms may have received the neces-
sary prerequisites for historic status, the most important
area needed to preserve that status, according to the resi-
dents, was not included in the designation, namely that
area in which the hotel-and-condominium complex
would be constructed.

It is in this area, currently zoned institutional and civic,
that Beynon 8: Co. received a 99-year lease for property-
including two parking lots—behind the Syria Mosque
and Masonic Temple. Much of the residents’ argument
against the complex centers on the repercussions the loss
of those parking lots might have on an already poor Oak-
land parking situation.

just as important, however, is the direct effect the com-
plex might have upon the quality of life in what is consi-
dered to be one of Pittsburgh’s oldest and best-maintained
neighborhoods. Attorney P. Christian Hague, president of

' the Schenley Farms Civic Association and a leading
spokesman for the residents, fears that the complex might
contrast with the existing architecture of the area, which
includes Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, the Masonic
Temple and the Cathedral of Learning, to name a few.

We would tend to agree with Mr. l-lague’s argument,
although we might not be as quick to object to the com-
plex if the developer asks himself some important ques-
tions before going ahead with construction.

The first question the developer should ask is: Is there
really a need for such a complex in Oakland, and if so, is
that the only place in which to put it? We find it hard to
believe that that is the only undeveloped area in Oakland,
and if it is, we find that rather saddening. In addition,
although we have heard statements from the developer
citing marketing studies which reveal that there is a defi-
nite need for the complex by the universities and hospitals
in the areas, we wonder who did those studies. The devel-
oper has been less than cooperative in releasing this
information. '

Which leads to our second point: Why has the developer
been so evasive in releasing any information about the
complex, such as the dimensions of the building or build-
ings, the cost, the parking facilities, the architectural styles
and other important facts that should be aired before any
definitive decisions can be made about whether,or not the
complex should be built.

Until these questions can be answered, and until Bey-
non 8c Co. has enough consideration to recognize the needs ’
of the Schenley Farms residents, we are not completely
against the complex but are instead cautious in arriving at
any. decision. In the meantime, we would hope that the
developer is slightly less evasive in the future when asked
for answers to the above questions.

Pitt News

K Panders
  Radical Chic

Dear Editor:

It is about time The Pitt News
gave its readers some credit. Con-
sidering the size of this university,
it's a shame The Pitt News is good
for little more than video game
coupons. This paper’s attempt to
pander to the hopelessly outdated
radical chic element in the faculty
and the student body with its cute
editorials brings nothing but ridic-
ule upon; the ediforialist and the

positions espoused in the’

editorials.

The editorial Feb. 1 editorial,
(“Resisting The Right”) will serve
as an example. If last week’s debate
had no socially redeeming value,
the blame must be shared by one of
the most uninspired public speak-
ers I have ever heard, Birch Bayh, as
well as his equally uninspiring
rival.

I am not surprised that The Pitt
News staff looks through maga-
zines for missing pictures. Judging
from the quality of the paper, this
must be quite a fascination for the
editorialist at least.

I, too, abhor people preaching
their particular gospels in public
places. But The Pitt News’ editors
do not seem to realize that they are
preaching from one of the most
public platforms in Pittsburgh.
The Pitt News’ brand of neander-
thalism may be just as offensive to
its readers as that of the Moral
Majority. I suggest The Pitt News
office he bombarded with the most
readily available garbage on cam-
pus, the latest issue of The Pitt
News.

The portions of the editorial
alluded to above can be written off
as attempted wit, but what fol-

,lowed showed a marked lack of

intelligence and insight. I’m (a
Republican who wears" worn-out
Nikes, faded jeans, and old sweat-
shirts. If The Student Government
Board and some frat “bovs" want
to become politically involved, so
wnat? At least tney care enough to
do something substantial on this
pitifully apathetic campus. If
Republicanism is a “foul form of
political
imagine you include voting in this
category also) I hope the majority
of voters in the last general election
is informed of this fact. Do the edi-
tors of The Pitt News volunteer to
tell America her tastes are foul?
The controversy concerning the
cheerleaders was not precipitated
by reactionaries who hate modern
music as was implied in the editor-
ial. It was created by some poor
deluded woman desperate for
attention in the face of the immi-
nent defeat of the Equal Rights

participation,” (I ‘

Responses to the New Riﬁhtl

viewpoints discuss some of the 

Amendment. While Republicans
deplore wife-beating too, we have
the sense to allow the cheerleaders
to express themselves as they
please. What a spectator interprets
a cheerleader’s movements to mean
depends upon the spectator alone.

Our weapons of choice in the
battle against the New Insipidness
are copies of National Review,

A The American Spectator, and pic-

tures of Ike.

Editorial Tone
‘ I
Bigoted and
. I _ ’

Oppressive
Dear Editor: I

I was amazed to read the childish
tirade ‘against the Moral Majority
and Republicanism which
appeared in Monday’s Pitt News
(Feb. 1, “Resisting the Right”).
Was it a gag? If-so, it doesn’t belong
on the editorial page. Instead of
presenting an intelligent and ana-
lytical criticism of the Moral
Majority and the New Right, the
writer launched into an irrational
and tactless vilification of the.
aforementioned groups. This
meaningless drivel is so ridiculous
that it's not even worthy of being
used in a high school journalism
class as a textbook example of irre-
sponsible newswriting. Several
parallels can (be drawn between
Monday's editorial and the Moral
Majority itself:

0 The religious tracts and news-
letters that the Moral Majority
print use ignorant and empty rhe-
toric to attack those who hold
views contrary to their own. By
printing this opinion, The Pitt
News has sunk to that same level of
nafrowmindedness. The article
attacks Republicans, specifically
young Republicans, only because
they are Republicans. Republicans
are unfairly stereotyped as wearing
alligator shirts, docksiders, and
belonging to fraternities. Con-
demning the Republican Party-
because of its very existence, and
not for its political philosophy, is
akin to attacking the United States
Constitution which explicitly
makes provisions for the two-party
system. As the Moral Majority
often does, The Pitt News is chal-
lenging a major component in the
structure of American democracy.

0 The editorial also questions
the presence or, as it put it, "infil-
tration” of Moral Majority spokes-
man Cal Thomas on campus.
Thomas debated former Demo-
cratic Senator Birch Bayh last
Thursday night in front of a
packed house in David Lawrence
Auditorium. To hear these two
men witlt diainetrically opposed

most important issues of the day
was quite an educational expe-
rience. But apparently The Pitt
News editorial opposed this event.
The Moral Majority also has a ten-
dency to denounce intellectual
activity or “Secular Humanism.”

The overall tone of this article
was bigoted and oppressive. The
logic is twisted and misdirected.

As a legitimate forum for liberal
commentary, The Pitt News is a
joke. By printing this witless dia-
tribe, The Pitt News has entirely
forfeited its credibility as an objec-
tive platform for the exchange of
ideas. 1

Was Emphasis

On Khomeini

Intended?

Dear Editor:

The analysis of the Moral Major-
ity by Christine Wiltanger in the
Ian. 27 The Pitt News (“The Moral
Majority: An Analysis”), where she
quoted many opinions held by Pitt
political science professor Richard

-Cottam, seemed to exemplify the
“contemptuous” treatment thaiﬁfh,

Cottam himself was quoted to say
this group receives. Ms. Wiltanger
waited until the last paragraph to
present what I consider to be Cot-
tam’s most telling insights regard-
ing the Moral Majority—that the
group is composed of people who
are “ . .sincere, devoted, and feel
they have been deprived and treated
contemptuously.”

Instead of emphasizing these

insights, Ms. Wiltanger chose to,

begin her article by immediately
presenting us with another of Cot-
tam’s observations, in which he
links Jerry Falwell to the Ayatollah
Khomeini! Was this apparent
emphasis really intended?

Wouldn't the reverse order have-Q

been more enlightening?

From his remarks, I assume that
Cottam is a liberal, and liberalism
has traditionally been associated
with the humane traits of toler-
ance, objectivity, scholarship, and
intellectual integrity. Cottam, in
the best liberal tradition, acknowl-
edges the validity and sincerity of
the Moral Majority’s perspective.

Ms. Wiltanger, on the other
hand, seemed contemptuous in the
way she indirectly and arbitrarily
maligned the Moral Majority
through her choice of emphasis in
the article, ostensibly presented in

the spirit of scholarship angfﬁu

objectivity.

I am assuming, of course, that
Ms. Wiltanger's article. reflects

The Med School’s Problems as Seen From Within  

Dear Editor:

As second-year medical students,
we are glad to see that The Pitt
News is continuing to pursue
issues concerning the medical
school. We would like to make the
following observations:

0 It seems quite obvious to some

Promoter
Respondsto
Promoter

Dear Editor:

Let me respond to Bill Jackson's
rejoinder to my earlier letter

, regarding Pitt Program Council

concert programming (Feb. 3,
“Programming Isn’t ‘Fish and
Seals”’). First, let me correct Mr.
Jackson’s misreading of my accu-
rately printed remarks. At no time
- in my letter did I state that I expe-
rienced promoter pressure. What I
did say was that “At no time did I
find less than total support for
whatever concerts I was holding.”

Second, it is obvious that Mr.
Jackson completely misses the
point of the cartoons that accom-
panied my letter and his. What the
artist, I believe, was trying to say is
that one person’s concert is another
person’s trained seal or dancing
bear act. PPC has to realize this and

adapt their programming accord-
ingly. They are apparently starting
to do this through the assessment
of student opinion. A determined,
on-going effort in this direction is
clearly called for.

Third, and most importantly,
Mr. Jackson fails to answer the
questions that I posed in my letter.
Questions such as: How much
money was the concert committee
allocated for this year? How much
money exactly was lost in produc-
ing Atlanta Rhythm Section and
Pable Cruise? How much money is
it costing to book Chic? How much
does it cost to rent Syria Mosque?
These are questions which stu-
dents as consumers of a service have
a right to know the answers to.

In closing, let me inform Mr.
Jackson and the rest of the PPC
Concert Committee that the issue
at hand is not whetherl nor anyone

~ else has ever programmed concerts

in an urban setting. The real issue
is how much longer you are going
to hide behind a wall of secrecy.
Secrecy that serves the purpose of
alienating you and PPC from the
student body by generating misun-
derstanding and anger based upon
a lack of knowledge concerning
concert programming. A full dis-
closure of concert committee deci-
sions and finances is called for.
When are we going to get one, Mr.
Jackson?

_ orienta'tion of The Pitt News, and

further, that The Pitt News is a
liberal newspaper. Maybe it isn’t; I
admit I have never seen where it has
explicitly stated to be so predis-
posed. But after all, isn't it the voice

Wkot a community supposably com-

mitted to preserving and promot-
ing the best of our inherited
traditions—including those of
objectivity and tolerance? Where
should we draw_ the line for the
voice of The Pitt News-—exactly at
the editorial page?

I believe The Pitt News invites
its readers to do otherwise-—to
assume that it is aliberal news-
paper, and to assume that its basic
philosophy is reflected in every-
thing it prints. Itherefore conclude
that The Pitt News has betrayed its
readers’ trust; the article I have dis-
cussed here is an example of the
type of irresponsible public writ-
ing presented in the guise of liber-
alism that has, over the past 20
years, given liberalism a bad name.

students here that both Dean

Donald Leon and Chancellor Wes-_

ley Posvar are playing both sides of
the game at once. Simultaneously,

hey are trying to impress the Liai-
son Committee on Medical Educa-
tion (LCME) and downplay any
serious problems that the medical
school is having, both to the
LCME and to the students, while
on the other hand crying “no
accreditation” as a means to pro-
cure as much funding from the
state as possible. Thanks to Robert
Glew and The Pitt News, these
less—than—honest dealings have
surfaced.

O In our sight, although there
may have been some exaggeration
at times in Glew’s claims, his ver-
sion has been closer to the truth
than not. This has become appar-
ent to us after reading of Leon’s
September report to Gov. Dick
Thornburgh in which he makes
almost identical claims about the

condition of the medical school as
Glew did six months prior to the

report.
0 The fact is that the medical
school was issued a three-year

accreditation; only 16 other schools
(out of over 100 medical schools in

demic decisions of the school.
Again the dean has ignored this
recommendation; the status report
to the LCME (submitted in Janu-
ary l982) was done with absolutely
no student contribution. Maybe
the dean was afraid of our exposing

this is the appointment of depart-

is the perception that the adminis-

their $250 million Health Center

quality of the basic sciences depart-

doubts that the Pitt medical school
will survive this current crisis, we
are less confident that the integrity

The Pitt News, Friday, February 5, 1982

Roosevelt Kirby scored Pitt’s last three points and grabbed a crucial rebound
in the Panther win over Rhode Island.

Panthers Beat RI,66-60

By scorr DELLETT

Once again, Darrell Gissen-
danner and Clyde Vaughan pulled
some magic out of their hats as the
Pitt Panther basketball team came
back from a eight-point deficit on
two separate occasions to defeat
Rhode Island 66-64 last night.
Vaughan came through with sev-
eral clutch baskets down the
stretch, while Gissendanner came
off the bench to spark the Panthers
with his aggressive, albeit some-
times out-of-control, style of play.

Pitt was frequently getting the
ball inside in the first half, but tra-
velling calls and missed layups
plagued the Panthers. Meanwhile,
Rhode ,Is1and was able to control
the offensive boards thanks to Marc
Upshaw, who had nine rebounds
in the first half. Along with the
outside shooting of guard Kevin
Whiting, the Rams opened a 18-11
lead in the first twelve minutes.

Enter Gissendanner. After
Dwayne Wallace, who played his
best game in three weeks, hit a 22-
foot jumper, Gissendanner made a
15-footer, then proceeded to steal
the inbounds pass. Despite the
ensuing missed layup by Trent
Johnson, the senior co-captain had
set the tone for the rest of the first
half.

Gissendanner cut the Rams’ lead
to 20-17 with two free throws, then
forced Rhode Island into a 10-
second call. Gissendanner hit a
short jumper off a three-on-one
break to cut the lead to one.

Gissendanner penetrated the
zone and fed a nice pass to Roose-
velt Kirby, who sunk a shot to tie
the score at 21, and moments later
made two free throws. After throw-
ing the ball away the previous time
down the court, Gissendanner stole
the ball and gave Vaughan a feed
the sophomore converted into an
easy layup.

For his efforts, Gissendanner
earned 10 points in just 10 minutes
of playing time in the first half.
The Pitt defense meanwhile made
some quick adjustments with jun-
ior Trent Johnson in the game, to
close off the passing lanes that were
opened to the Rams in the early
stages of the first half.

However, Rhode Island made
some adjustments to the Panthers’
1-3-1 pressure zone. Roland Hous-
ton started the second half with a
drive down the middle of the lane

Clyde Vaughan

and drew a foul by Johnson. The
6-8 center converted the three-point
play, one of five in the second half,
and the Rams started their surge.

A lack of rebounding on the def-
ensive boards hurt Pitt as Horace
“Pappy” Owens got the offensive
rebound off a Michael Whiting
shot and again drew a foul from
Johnson and Owens made the free
throw to tie the game at 29.

After a free throw by Vaughan, a
Kirby layup, and a short jumper by
Houston, Rhode Island ran off
eight unanswered points thanks to
its aggressive defense and strong
rebounding.

Freshman Kevin Kennedy con-
verted a steal into a layup, Houston
drew a foul from Vaughan after
hitting a 13-foot jumper and com-
pleted the three-point play,
Upshaw scored on an uncontested
layup due to confusion in the back-
line and Owens made a layup on a
3-on-1 fast break to up the score to
37-29, Rhode Island.

Vaughan broke the string with
two foul shots, but Owens took a
pass from Wendall Walters and
drew another foul from Vaughan
earning the Rams’ third three-
point play in the half.

A jumper by Pitt guard Billy
Culbertson and two free throws by
Vaughan cut the lead to four, but
the three-point menace continued
to haunt the Panthers. This time,
Houston was able to get inside of

Steve Beatty and banked the ball in
»while drawing a foul. Houston’s
free throw was true and the Rams’
lead was up to seven, 47-40.

Again, Gissendanner provided
the catalyst to the Panther come-
back. With 6:54 to play, and Rhode
I'sland threatening to take control
of the game, the 6-2 guard went
inside the lane and into the land of
the giants, grabbed a rebound off a
shot by Vaughan, and converted
the layup while being fouled by
Compton. Gissendanner swished
the free throw and the Panthers cut
the lead to five, 52-47.

Despite the efforts of Gissen-
danner, the Rams were able to
regain a seven-point lead with 4:44
left to play. This was the time for
Vaughan, a specialist in incredible
comebacks, to go to work.

With the exception of a Roose-
velt Kirby layup and two free
throws by Johnson, it was all
Vaughan. Unlike the early stages
of the game, where he scored most
of his points from the inside, the
6-4 sophomore forward used a var-
iety of spin-around, fade-away,
long distance jumpers to give the
Panthers the lead. Then, with 1:37
left, Vaughan gave Pitt the lead for
good.

The final minute became nail-
biting time for Coach Roy Chip-
man. Kirby came up to the line
three times ‘in a one-and-one situa-
tion, and each time the 6-7 junior
forward would hit the first shot and
miss the second. The last foul came
with three ticks on the clock after
Kirby grabbed a loose ball follow-
ing a wild scramble under the
Rhode Island basket as the Rams
tried to tie the score.

Vaughan led all scorers with 24
points, followed by Gissendanner
with 17 and Kirby with 11. The box
score told the story of Rhode Island
this year-—four players, led by
Houston with 17 points, entered
the game averaging in double fig-
ures in scoring. After the four star-
ters, the list drops off, showing the
lack of depth the Rams have.

Pitt Coach Roy Chipman, after
the game, said he was thankful the
Panthers won last night heading
into Saturday’s Massachusetts
game with two consecutive tough
defeats could have a disasthrows,
then forced Rhode Island into-a 10-

second call. Gissendanner hit a
short jumper off a three-on-one
break to cut the lead to one.

Parade All-America Rich Bowen
excels equally well whether run-
ning or throwing the football, and,
like any good Pitt man—old or
new—has no qualms about telling
Penn State football coach Joe
Paterno where to go.

Bowen, at a press conference at
Serra High School yesterday,
announced that he will sign a letter
of intent with Pitt, thus officially
concluding one of the area's most
heated recruiting wars, a battle that
really ended with a phone call
Tuesday night.

The 6-2, 197 pound Bowen, chaf-
ing at the probability of getting
redshirted his sophomore season if
he attended Penn State, telephoned
Nittany Lion assistant coach Jerry
Sandusky Tuesday night to inform
him he would attend Pitt. San-
dusky then telephoned Paterno,
who cancelled his final wooing
visit to Bowen’s home and returned
to Happy Valley.

Bowen said he chose Pitt over
Penn State partly because of the
Lions’ admitted intent to redshirt
him should current quarterback
Todd Blackledge, himself a former
redshirt, forgo his final year of elig-
ibility in 1983 to enter the NFL
draft.

The notion that his perfor-
mance, no matter how good, might
not help him avoid a redshirt
didn’t appeal to Bowen.

At Serra High School last season,
Bowen, under the tutelage of his
father, Eagles coach Dick Bowen,

yards and 15 touchdowns. In addi-
tion to his quarterback duties,

Pitt Signs Bowen

Bowen was also an all-conference
safety for the Eagles, who went 12-0
en route to capturing the WPIAL
Class A title’.

The chance to enter an estab-
lished, winning program near
home and play a year behind Pitt
All-America quarterback Dan
Marino were two weighty factors in
the decision, according to Bowen.

“Being close to home was the
main thing. I wanted my parents to
see me play,” Bowen explained.
“After I narrowed it down to the
two schools, it was Pitt all along.”

After entertaining sales pitches
from about “75 or 80 schools,”
Bowen said he was very anxious to
escape the recruiting pressure he’s
been under in recent weeks.

“I was a little afraid at first-
everybody showing you all that
attention, wanting to talk to you
and wanting to come see you, I was
very anxiousjto get it over with,”
Bowen said.

After narrowing his choices
down to Pitt and Penn State—
Bowen also briefly considered visit-
ing Iowa and Miami, but later
cancelled the trips—the quarter-
back had to choose between two
family friends—Paterno and Pitt’s
new head coach Foge Fazio.

Bowen’s father is a longtime
friend of Paterno’s and Rich
worked for the Lion coach at his
football camp last summer. The
elder Bowen also knows Fazio from
their playing days at Pitt in 1955-
56, while the younger Bowen has
made numerous friends on the cur-
rent Pitt team during his frequent
visit to the Pitt locker room the last
three years.

Lady Panthers Roll

By MARIE HUFF

The sloppy butsweet Pitt Lady
Panther basketball team, amid all
the turnovers and personal fouls
Wednesday night, still managed to
display their offensive talent and
bench strength.

The result: a 77-59 Pitt win over
Howard University, moving the
Lady Panthers’ record to 13-8. The
Lady Panthers are preparing to
spend another weekend on the
road, this time in Detroit and
Cleveland.

The game, in effect, was won by
the Lady Panther freshmen. Jen-
nifer Bruce started things for Pitt
with a lay—up off a pass from senior
Carol Dugan. Renee Roma,
another freshman, was pressed into
duty because of point guard Debbie
Lewis’ ankle injury. Roma was on
the receiving end of another Dugan
pass, and she quickly swished a
jumper from five feet out.

Bruce added three more baskets,
Dugan put one in from 10 feet out,
and freshman Lori Lewman con-
nected for two points off yet
another Dugan pass to end a skein
that gave Pitt a 14-4 lead five min-
utes into the game.

Lewis returned to the line-up,
and the Lady Panthers didn’t miss
a beat. Lewman hit four in a row
for the Lady Panthers, and the lead
climbed to 24-10. However, the Pitt
defense collapsed, and Michele
Dyer, Donna Wood, and Blondell
Curnell each scored two buckets for
the Bisonettes, chopping the lead
to four points, 28-24. with six min-

Five minutes into the second

head coach Jackie Sherrili’s recent
departure to Texas A8cM figured
only slightly as he debated which
school to attend.

“When I first heard about it, it
worried me a little. If the whole
coaching staff had left with him, I
might have had second thoughts.

But when I heard Fazio would be
there and the coaches were staying,

I knew it would be alright,” Bowen ’

said.

 Bowen was so convinced it’s now

in writing, which should make
Fazio rest a little easier. The new
coach, who was unavailable for
comment yesterday, has said he
would like to recruit two quarter-
backs this season to prepare for
Marino’s leave next year.

Other players who are rumored
to be leaning toward Pitt are Valley
star Jiill Callahan, one of the
WPIAL’S leading rushers last year.
Callahan, who runs the 40-yard
dash in a speedy 4.3 seconds, has
called a‘ press conference for today
to presumably announce his
choice.

Pitt is also actively wooing two

Pitt senior Karen Zandi works as
a research assistant, a legal assist-
ant and carries a full load of credits
in Pitt's School of Social Work. For

fun, she also works out three to

four hours a day as a member of the
Pitt Gymnastics team.

While most athletes regard prac-
tice as a necessary onus, Zandi
approaches the session with the
same fervor that characterizes her

, plunge into the rest of her busy

schedule.

“I’m always involved in too
many other things. Gymnastics is a
time to take my mind off other
things——it is a time for myself,”
Zandi said.

It makes no difference what
activity Zandi is engaged in, she
exerts herself to the fullest in every
one. She demonstrates her whole-
hearted effort in gymnastics prac-

» tice every day. For in spite of the

numerous tumbles and spills she
encounters on the Balance Beam ,
she always comes up smiling, mak-
ing it evident that she puts her
utmost into every available
minute.

Unlike other female gymnasts,
whose training was regimented at a
very young age, Zandi did not start
gymnastics until her freshman year
in high school.

“I used to teach myself tricks like
front and back walkovers, but I
wanted to learn more,” said Zandi.

After a successful high school
gymnastics career, she had high
hopes of attending a school with a
gymnastics team. Zandi finally
decided upon Pitt after going to the
Bradford Campus’s Summer Gym-
nastics Camp and meeting the
coach and team members.

From the start Zandi perceived

at

that there was a big difference

between college and high school
level gymnastics.

“In high school we worked out
two hours after school for three
months. There was little emphasis
on technique and perfection, we
just threw tricks right away,”
Zandi said.

College proved to be the exact
opposite of Zandi’s prior gymnas-
tics experiences.Almost all the
emphasis was on technique and
perfection and “practicing from
September to May almost blew my
mind,”Zandi added laughing.

For the past four years, Zandi
had devoted a significant portion
of her day practicing. Ironically,
she says “My best workouts are on
the days which I feel run down. I
feel really lousy during the day but
when I go up to the gym, things
just start to click.”

Whenever it is necessary for
Zandi
unyielding dedication makes it
hard.

“I not only feel guilty about
missing practice, but 1 also feel that
this could have been my day to
really achieve something,” said
Zandi A

Many athletes have trouble cop-
ing with the anxiety produced by
competition, but Zandi said, for
her, this pressure is advantageous
to a point.

“Whenever the pressure is really
on, and I know that my teammates
are all pulling for me, I always
seem to do much better," Zandi
said. -

For Zandi, gymnastics is super-
ceded only by one other love-
nature. Growing up in Allegheny,
N.Y., in a small rural town, Zandi
says she acquired an inherent love
for the outdoors.

“Whenever I have a free week-
end, I always spend it outdoors. At
the beach, in the mountains, any-
where there is fresh air, I love it,”
Zandi said.

She admits that it ws difficult to
immediately adapt to the city when
she first entered Pitt. “My first year
here was a disaster—-I couldn't wait
to go back home. I really thought

to miss a practice, her’

\»

that the city was the end of the _

world——a blackhole,” Zandi said.

Although her views about the
city have changed, Zandi says she
will never lose close touch with
nature. .

Gymnasts Face Temple

By MIKE ROSE

The Pitt mens’ gymnastics team
takes on the Temple Owls tomor-
row in the Panthers’ first home
meet of the year.

Pit gymnastics coach Frank
D’Amico expects this meet to be the
closest this year, and probably the
most important.

“It is going to come down to the
last event,” D’Amico said. “It is

going to be that close”,

D’Amico said the skill levels of
both Pitt and Temple have
improved a great deal—both teams
are close to being nationally
ranked. The two teams have had
very close matches the last couple
of years with the home team always
winning the meet. -

‘According to D’Amico, Temple
Wlll be strong on the parallel bars

lcers Back in Action

By SCOTT DELLETT

The Pitt Hockey Club, coming
off two disturbing losses to Navy,
faces league foes St. Vincent Bear-
cats and West Virginia Mountain-
eers this weekend in two games that
could make or break the Panthers’
season.

The Panthers are coming off two
lopsided losses to Navy (5-0 and 9-1
last weekend), losses that Panther
Coach Fran Czemerda attributed to

» several players’ attitude problems.

“I was disappointed in five or six
individuals who decided to have a
good time instead of playing
hockey,” Czemerda said. “With the
right mental attitude, we could
have made the games a whole lot
closer. We had some good perfor-
mances from Jeff Rohay, Fred Erny
and Roger Paul, but that wasn’t
enough. I expected a lot more than
what they gave 

Czemerda said the problems
have been discussed with the lacka-
daisical players and the case is
closed. At least the coach hopes
so--with the Panthers’ return to
league play, this is the worst possi-
ble time for a team crisis.

Despite their dismal perform-
ance at Navy, Czemerda said he
believes his team can match up to
any team hit for hit.

“The games against Navy, com-

bined with the St. Bonaventure
game, helped the team quite a
bit,’ ’Czemerda said. “We have both
finesse players and hard-nosed
players, but the team is leaning
toward being a hard-nosed team.”

Czemerda -believes his. team is
showing signs of growing pains.

“We are a team that is able to
capitalize on mistakes by the other
team,” Czemerda said. “We rarely
miss scoring opportunities. We
have a tendency to score in spots
and then coast, which is a sign of a
young team.” ‘

Pitt is currently 5-2 in the West-
ern Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Hockey League, which puts the
Panthers in third place in the
Greater Pittsburgh division; six
points behind division leader
Duquesne, but the Dukes have
played three more games.

Czemerda believes that in order
to stay close to the division leaders,
Pitt must continue to defeat their
rivals.

“This is a very important week-
?end,” Czemerda said. “Everyone is
bunched on the_top. It will be a
tight race until the playoffs.

Saturday’s game with St. Vin-
cent gets underway at I p.m. at the
Civic Arena. Sunday's WVU game
at the Lakevue Arena in Valencia
begins at 4:30 p.m..

and floor exercise. The Owls
should dominate the high bar too,
since, according to D’Amico, it is
Pitt’s weakest event.

Both teams rank about even in
the floor exercise, but Pitt has
higher scoring performers on the
rings and vault.

“Our worst events are our last
three events, so we have to be up by
a considerable margin going into
them,” D’Amico said.

The coach expects his team to be
better than they have ever been
before, and, in that vein of optim-
ism, added he fully expects his
team to score a 260 at home. If the
Panthers do hit 260, they'll estab-
lish a new team scoring record—a
score D’Amico said could push Pitt
into the Top 20.

The Pitt team is in its best shape
of the year, mentally and physi-
cally, according to D’Amico, who
predicted that it will take at least a
score of 9.1 to win each event.

in the country.

They're in a major league—the AAI Corporation. And,
while some of our teams are active on defense projects, others
are all over the lot engineering and producing electronics and

This engineering-team system lets you work as an individ-
ual. You’ll have freedom to create, design and follow through
on state—of—the~art projects never attempted before. You’ll have
freedom to work on many different ones. (As a rule, our start-
to—finish time frames are shorter than industry averages.) You’ll
have freedom to attend seminars, to present papers.

You’ll have freedom, too, to live wherever and however
you want. Urban, suburban, rural and on—the—water living are
all close to our suburban Baltimore location.

One last point: salaries and benefits are competitive. And
our regular review system really is regular. We're sticklers
about it because, if you're good, we’ll want to keep you.

If you’re planning an engineering career, can we draft you
for an AAI team? For more information or an appointment, call
Personnel at (301) 628-3800. Or write The AAI, P.O. Box 6767,
