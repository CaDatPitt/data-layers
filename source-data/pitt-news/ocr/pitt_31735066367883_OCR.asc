Swimming, Golf, Tennis, Singing, and Mock
War to Highlight Activities of September 4
By JIM HUFNAGEL 0
Schedules can be boring, but the one Mary Alice Polyak
has arranged for Freshman Day will be anything but dull.
Date for the Student Government-sponsored event has
been set for September‘ 4. The freshmen will leave the
Student Union in Pittsburgh Railway chartered buses for
Kiski Prep School at 12:30 p.m. There they will spend an
%afternoon of swimming, golf, ten-
nis and other games.

A mock war will begin at 4:30
p.m. Sides for this war will be
determined by the color of the
ticket which participants have
been issued.

Dinner will run from 5:45 to

7:30 p.m. at which time the eve-
ning program will commence.
Included in the activities will_ be
a skit by a singing group and a
rally and informal sing, con-
ducted by the cheerleaders.

Freshmen are scheduled to re-
turn to the University around
10:30 p.m. This is the third year
for the project. Tickets will go
on sale August 30 and will cost
$1.50. An alternate program has
been set in case of rain.

Members of the Freshman
Day committee include: Bruce
Palmer on sports; Fryne Pearl-
stein in charge of publicity;
Marilyn Albert for food; Linda
Lee on tickets; Debbie Meyer for
the alternate program; Rege

Summer Graduates

,Over 700 Degree Candidates
Brings Year’s Total to 2000 9

Over 700 students graduate from the University this
week and boost the total of 1961 graduates to 2,000.

Of the 400 undergraduates and 330 graduate degree
candidates, about 20 can be expected not to make it, said
Gary Hess of the Office of Student Records. _
Although the students graduating this term will be

considered alumni
vintage, they will not participate
in official commencement exercis-
es until next June. At this cere-
mony they will join the December
graduates (still class of 1961) and
next Apri1’s graduates (class of
1962.) .

This August’s class is one of
the last classes which entered
under the semester system. Next
Apri.l’s graduates will actually
be the last but many of those
who entered under the semester
went spring trimester and so
will be completing their educa-
tion this week.

The deﬁcit in undergraduates
will be replenished“ on August 28
when approximately 1100 new
freshmen arrive on campus. Reg-
istration ﬁgures for the fall term
show a marked decrease from
the ﬁgures reported at thew, same
time last year.

According to last year’s report
the University had received 3,040
applications, had accepted 2,093
of these, and had received admis-
sion fees from 1,260 as of Monday,
July 25.

Many other colleges in the na-
tion, however, are 10 per cent be-
low last year in the recruiting of
incoming freshmen, according to
Everard Pinneo, director of ad-
missions.

Poll Reveals General Support Berlin Stand

Students React To Kennedy Speech

By Barry Gross and Paul Wilson

“This is it! We can’t back
down.” Those words were spoken
by Joe Halovanic, a chem sopho-
more, and indicate the general
student reaction to President
Kennedy’s speech on the Berlin
crisis.

The speech was strong enough,
Halovanic felt, to show the Rus-
sians that we consider Berlin im-
portant enough to ﬁght for if nec-
essary. The ROTC member be-
lieves that in case students are
needed, graduates should be
drafted ﬁrst because they are
closer to the age limit.

Howard Nader. a graduate stu-

dent in Dentistry, has the opposite

view on the draft. He feels that if
drafting of students becomes nec-
essary, undergraduates should go
ﬁrst. Nader believes that because
of the confidence the American
people have shown in the Presi-
dent’s speech, the Russians will
back down.

A visitor to the Campus from
India also had some comments
on the President’s speech. Shir-
ish B. Sheth, from "Bombay, who
is at TCU as part of a training
program for a Texas company,
said that “the President’s speech-,
spoken clearly and ﬁrmly, pre-- 4
sented a line of toughness that

should have been used before.”

Mr. Sheth feels that “no one

wants war, especially. with the
type of weapons that have been
developed. The fact that the Rus-
sian people do not want war will,
I hope, soften the Russian view.”

Asked what he would do if the
government should begin con-
scripting college men, Robert
Morris, a psychology sophomore,
replied “When they start drafting

upper classmen, I will enlist and
get into intelligence work.

All ﬁve“quoted, ‘as’ well as

others -interviewed, generally “do

not want war, but feel that we

must and will stand firm on Ber-
lin. .

f  or A M A soreness

The U_niversity will feel no immediate effects from
President Kennedy’s increased draft call. Few of our men
will be asked to, leave their education right now to ﬁght
for their country. As William A. Stewart, assistant in the

‘admissions ofﬁce, put it, the increase in the draft is still
too young to cut into the traditional age group of college
students. Nevertheless, the threat that such a thing can.

happen is there. We cannot become complacent and com-
fortable in our role as deferred students. If the .call to

, lligvht comes this'September, or any September after that,

we must be ready to go and know why we are going.
The President has ‘pledged-the United States to ﬁght

C, p —— if a battle with the Communists must be fought. He has,
- expressed his conﬁdencethat -the American people will
not ﬂinch in their duty to back up his statements. iAnd,'

judging from the comments of the young men at Pitt, we
will -back them up. 

Yet the whole situation has troubling undertones.
While it’s easy to understand the general feeling that no
one wants war and the hesitation to ﬁght, the motivation
to answer the President’s call to arms is ‘puzzling. “We
will ﬁght if we must.” Elyeryone is echoing the words of
the President, but do they mean the same thing? Presi-
dent Kennedy has told Mr. Khrushchev that we will ﬁght
for Berlin because we believe in the Western idea of democ-
racy. Russian aggression must be stopped. The young men

.of Pitt have told reporters that they will ﬁght for Berlin

because they have been told to ﬁght.
This is not a polemic on patriotism- But the lack. of
enthusiasm these men have displayed in meeting the prob-

‘. lem at all is frightening. When they are told to do some-
thing they will. Until then they admittedly will go on as

usual.
_ We can crawl back into our shells to contemplate the
pressing problems of ﬁnal ex.ams,‘coming vacations and the
rapidly approaching fall trimester, only to peek out when
we ‘feel another prickling disturbance‘ coming‘ from the
outside world. , '

Or, we could live up to our name as intelligent, think-
ing Students by shaping our presentconcern into a deﬁnite

opinion that we will ﬁght not only because the President _

has committed us, but that we will ﬁght because it is the
only way we can remain free. The effect is not immediate,
but we cannot forget its causes. ‘

Vacation Vortex . . .

By Jim CH ufnogel

Oh, Oh! Less than one more week and the spring
term will be over. For some it will mean leaving
the Cathedral’s cool ‘security and padding the Aug-
ust pavement looking for work. But with all this
furor about Berlin and low selective service pools,
many of the .male graduates
need not worry about employ-
ment. The others? -—- well, you
fortunate females and 4f’ers will
make out somehow.

I am much more concerned,
however, about we who remain.
What. will we ever do with
these four long, boring weeks
which yawn before’ us?" What
will we do without the .ever-
present goals of midterms, term- 
papers, and other sundry stim-
ulating challenges to give meaning to our lives?

You laugh, “Ha, just you wait!” and thump
your anthropology book with pent-up vigor.

But wait a minute. Will you really read all
those worthwhile books for which you never found
time during the past eleven months? Do you really
plan to spend every other night at the opera and
those in between at art galleries?" Are the library
and museum really at the top of your August fun
list?

. Let’s face it. You are not going to search, as it
says in our Catalogue, for that “intellectual and
aesthetic experience that seeks to understand both
man and his heritage, that disciplines the mind si-
multaneously with both the methods and content
of the arts and sciences, and that imposes a respon-
sibility for action in a rapidly—changing society.”

Contributes to China

Tell the truth. You’ll miss the feeling of schol-
arly achievement which accompanies the comple-
tion of an erudite thesis on “Wu, Pei-fu: His con-
tribution to Central China,” or “The Economy and
Political Structure of the Vatombotse.” You’ll nos-
talgically conjugate a Spanishiverb every now and

War ‘And More War...

-By Nothon Firestone

One of the main goals of the Kennedy admin-
istration in foreign affairs appears to be the attain-

ment of a disarmament agreement with the Soviet.

Union.» This is a natural goal for any government
of a nation that has in this century lost so many
precious lives in two major wars
and a limited conﬂict. I »

But although disarmament
may possibly be achieved at
some time in the future (Soviet
actions leave no hope that it will
come in the near future), it will
not mean the end of war, as all
of us hope.

President Kennedy is being
realistic to dem_a,nd a stiff in-
spections system before any ac’;-
tual disarmament takes place.

But, assuming that a miracle takes place, and
Russia and China agree to inspections, what will
this mean? .

It will reduce the chances of accidental war.
It will mean the end of contamination of the atmo-
sphere through nuclear testing. And, obviously, it

vill indicate a decrease in international tensions.

But,‘it will not mean that war is a thing of the
ast, and there is no sense in deluding ourselves
n this point. .

Any country that wishes to make aggression
can rearm conventionally. Germany did in the
‘30’s when other nations had the capabilities of
stopping her. And if the world is disarmed, who
would be able to stop an outlaw nation. The very
best we could ,hope for would be an arms race,
withgthelaggressor having a huge head start.

Knowledge is Dangerous]

In the area of nuclear weapons, it is perfectly
obvious that even if every single atomicsor hydro-
gen weapon were to be destroyed, the knowledge
of how‘ to make them could never be destroyed.

The danger of disarmament would be that it
would give a false conﬁdence to any nation plan-
ning aggression. It would hope to catch the rest of
the world napping,

But then, it is really foolish to talk about re-
arming after disarmament. For what national lead-
er, acting in the interests of his nation, would nt
hoide a few weapons here and there, just in case,

But . . . you won’t do anything about'jt_ Ympn
sleep till lunch and loll in the sun at swimming
pools and steal ashamedly away for picnics in the
park. While wasting all this precious time on such
frivolities you’1l‘hate your idle self and curse the
four-week vacation and pine for the intellectual
ecstasy which only a classroom can produce_

No, dear friends and erstwhile scholars, our?

lofty intentions will be seduced from‘ us by the
negligent triviality of a feckless August world.

When those ‘Cathedral doors spin open‘ next

September we’ll be an angry mob milling about i

on Bigelow Blvd., as thirsty for knowledge as the
French revolutionaries were for freedom‘. Loudly

we’ll rue those 30 days of tedious irresponsibility.

    

and wistfully we’ll hope to recapture a few mo- '

ments of those almost mystical insights into knowl.
edge that we experienced during July.

Potent Sheep

Some will enter the next term with trepidation
because they know that in less than .a year they
must undergo another disillusioning experience.

The rest of us can thank our potential sheep-
skins that we will be spared the moral deteriora.
tion of another wasted August.

Are we helpless? Must we sit in silence and
endure the wrong inflicted upon us by the tyranny
of a system that steals a twelfth of our education
per annum?

No! But we must act immediately! If we be-

' seech, bother, and badger our administrators long

enough and loudly enough, they may relent. With
the support of Student Government, SANE, the
class club, and other campus action organizations
we can circulate petitions, hold rallies, and refuse
to take ﬁnals until we are assured that we will not
be thrown out into a philistine August.

It will not be an easy task. Administrators are
notoriously reluctant to extend school terms. But
if we can mobilize 100 per cent support, how many
will support such a movement?

None, I hope. i

Disarmament Danger

of course‘? Thus, real and total disarmament is
something that is not really attainable.

The only way the world would have a really
effective chance of ﬁghting was would be to estab-
lish a world government. This is something that
will simply not happen for a long time, if it ever
will, at all. There is only one major power in the
world that really wants world government, with
only ,one string attached —- the capital ‘should
preferably be in Moscow.

And what would happen if there were world
government? There is a good chance that the
whites would develop grievances toward the color-
ed, the English speaking nations would ﬁnd that
the others were stepping on their feet, etc., ad
infinitum, ad nauseum. A

I must~now draw the unhappy conclusion that
war is natural to man. It has been with him since.

the beginning of time, and I fear that it will re-.«

main withman until his timeyon this planet ex-

Reds Look Black

This does not mean that we should abandon
our efforts to deal with the Russians in this area.
If war is not averted, it may be delayed. And It
may ﬁnd that I was too pessimistic about human
nature after all. A

But one thing is certain. No American -leader
should even seriously consider disarmament until
the most stringent form of inspections system is
developed and adhered to by both sides. For once
disarmament begins, it will be too late to nego-

tiate grievances with the Russians. We will not be ,

able to say, “You’re not sticking to your end of
the bargain.” If we ever get to that stage, it’ll be
all over. ‘

“WRITE NO EVIL”

A Chinese legend says that Confuscius told his disciples a special
message as a guide for their lives when he was about to depart
from the earth. The sage drew pictures of three monkeys in the sand
and told his disciples the maxim, “Speak no evil, see no evil, ‘hear no
evil.”

Confuscius may have thought that he was pretty comprehensive
with this rule, but he had no inkling that a gent named Johannes
bry0“0f the newsp_aper. ,

Since then a legion of sports ﬁgures and coaches have wanted
to scold the Sage of China for not scrawling, “Write no evil!”

Next fall I will assume the position of sports editor of The Pitt
News and I suppose that I will be embraced to the bosom of the
coaching fraternity if I follow that dictim.

Press Agenf or Criﬁc?

Many coaches have the attitude that sportswriters are supposed
to be their press agents and write only what they want the -scribes to
write..Not only the coaches, but some school officials as well.

But, after all, it’s like marriage — a 50-50 proposition. The coach
helps, the scribe returns by printing the news ac.urately.'The public,
the team—-and the coach--beneﬁt. If a coach finds his public rela-
-tions lagging, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s the coach’s own fault.

I think, however, that one should veer away from being a hat-
chetman because the constantknockers eventually destroy their
contacts and sources of information. They wind up in ivory towers.
I also see no point in publicizing a louse, not when there are plenty
of nice, amusing guys around.

The sports columnist belongs where excitement is at its most in-
tense, where interest is highest. He gets to know practically everyone
in the sphere of athletics, hobnobbing with the heroes on terms of

ti!
"Earning A Living" ,

Yet, Grantland Rice, the late dean of American sportswriters who
turned out masterpieces for nearly half a century, once said: “isn’t
this a helluva way to earn a living?”

Arthur Daley, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize Award for
his daily column, “Sports of the TIMES,” has remarked,’ “I can’t
think of a more attractive way to‘ earn a living than be paid to at-
tend sportsievents from the best vantage pointxin the joint.”

Don’t let the mention of “earning a living” throw you. There
is no payola involved in this job. Only someday I would like to. reap
the beneﬁts legitimately in the newspaper or magazine world.

I would, like my column, “It Goes On . . .,” to serve as a launch-
jng pad to catapult me into the atmosphere that former sports editor

of sport.

From Shrimp To Ham

Like Myron my high school days were spent at Allderdice right
here in this city, and I would like press agent Beano Cook’s name
for me to come true-—i.e. “the lrishman’s answer to Myron Cope.”

It is much more ﬂattering than “the poison pen.”

Next fall I ‘shall strive to abstain from being like the boy who.
threw stones at frogs in sport, because the offended are like the
frogs--they do not die in sport, but in earnest.

Lightning can strike twice!
Schenley Six came up with

a last inning rally to knock
off the Chemical Engineers
14-13. The win gave them a
shot at the Intramural soft-
ball championship. Last week
Schenley produced an almost
identical rally to win the title.
For the Chem-E’s lightning did
strike twice, this time 9-8.

But Schenley did not find the
rallies so easy to come by in
their game with the IM All-
Stars. The All—IM team scored
early in the game and managed
to hold on to a 5-4 ‘victory.

It was almost a nightmare for
the Chemicals in their champion-

the week before, the Chem-E’s
held a lead, this time two runs,
going into the last of the seventh.

It Happened Twice

And just the way it happened
the previqus week, Schenley put
two men on base with singles. A
single by Ben Jinks tied the‘
game. Bob Gutshall was on third

By MATTI-IE

The long-awaited novel by Johnsteinbeck, “The Win-‘"

W NESVISKY

ter of Our Discontent”. (Viking Press; 311 pp.; $4.50), has
proven to be well worth the wait.

The book is almost" an entirely new venture for the
Pulitzer'Prize winner. It is set in present day New England,

which is about as far as one
typing grounds of the Califor

But it is evident that the author knows Yankeelandd

can get from Steinbeck’s old

His descriptions of the harbors, sloops and ﬁshing villages are

New Editor

"Julie Thomas, the newly—ap-
pointed Editor of the Pitt News,

The board consists of Matthew

¢as realistically moving as any ‘of
concerning,

Steinbeck’s
the west.

More than the setting, how-
ever, the characters are new
ventures for Steinbeck. Eathan
Allan Hawley is a dyed-in-th‘e-
draw] Harvardian Y a n k e e,
whose ancestors were greeted on
our shore by astonished Indians.
His wife, Mary, came from low-
er stock. His children, Allan and
Ellen, are average American
kids: too old to spank and too
young for the electric chair.

Hawley, a college graduate,
works in a grocery store in New
Baytown. His father has previous-
ly lost everything the family
owned except the house and the
ancient surname which still car-
ries respect in the town.

At first glance, Hawley appears
to be a dull character, and at
ﬁrst, he actually is. Hawley is an
honest man.

The author makes no circum-
locution‘ when he states that in
America this a rarity. And the
plot centers around how Hawley
attempts to become a dishonest
man.

The New Englander is pressur-

ed» by his family and friends into
re-appraising his rather unattrac-
tive ﬁnancial state. He craftily
creates a change of character in
his employer, his best friend, his
tefnptress and his daughter with-
out realizing it. All Hawley really
tries .to do is make a good, dis-
honest American buck.
. Slick is the word to describe
John Steinbeck’s latest work, be-
cause the reader has the feeling
that the events and characters
adhere t-o the author’s slightest
whim.
