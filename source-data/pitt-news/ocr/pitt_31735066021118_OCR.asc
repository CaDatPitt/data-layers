UNIVERSITY or PHTSBURGH

Power dispute results in Pitt provost’s resignation

By Scot Ross

News Editor

University of Pittsburgh Provost
Rudolph H. Weingartner an-
nounced Friday that he is step-
ping down at the end of the
winter term because of a conflict
with President Wesley Posvar
over the role of the provost as a
spokesman of the academic com-
munity and how centralized that
power should be between the
two offices. A

Weingartner, the provost since
August of 1987, said yesterday
that a disagreement with the han-
dling of the budget was at the
”heart” of the problem.

"Since everything costs money
and good words alone don't ac-
complish all that much," he said,
”it is a matter of my participation
in the budget process that we are
in disagreement about, but we're
in disagreement about [this] be-
cause of a disagreement about
the centrality of the academic en-
terprise.”

As provost, Weingartner is the
chief academic officer. Posvar
charges that Weingartner tried to
overstep his bounds, and Posvar"s
refusal to accept this led to the
resignation.

”He wanted me to give up the
authority of the president,” Pos-
var said. ”He openly, frankly and

in a positive way asserted that he
wanted me to deputize the
authority to run the university to
him.”

Posvar added that Weingartner
”had whatever role he wished to
have in the budget at any and all

times.”

In a statement released yester-
da_,y, Posvar alleges that Weingart-
ner ”repeatedly asked for
extensions of his own jurisdiction
and in various sectors;_[he also]
insisted on a further and formal
delegation and sharing of authori-
ty-vested in the president. 

In the statement, however, Pos-
var said that Weingartner wanted
”budget authority in areas out-
side his purview.”

Posvar also said that Weingart-
ner had full authority over a
budget of $80 million.

Posvar said, ’-‘He made an ul-
timatum which I think he knew
was unacceptable,” adding that l

6Health service distributes random surveys

‘-By Sandra Kramer

Staff Writer

Earlier this month, the Student
Health Service along with the
Student Health Advisory Board
sent out 1,000 questionnaires in
an effort to gather information
regarding the personal health
practices of students.

According to Dr.
Haberman, health. educator for
the SHS, the questionnaire is part
of a coniprehensive survey to

help the SHS design and develop 7

Shirley H

programs more responsive to stu-
dent needs. P
Haberman said, ’’I designed
this survey to get information
[about] personal health issues, in-
cluding emotional, sexual, exer-

cise, diet and alcohol and drug

behaviors.” v

Students were randomly select-
ed by computer and received the

' survey in their mailboxes.

.-”_So far we have had a 30v[per-.
cent to] 35 percent return on the

I

 

questionnaires, which is good for
a survey like this,” said
Haberman. H '

”We have set a deadline for the
return of the surveys for March
27, and I am hoping to get'addi-
tional feedback atthat time," she
added. ‘

The advisory. board. is en-
couraging each student who

received theisurvey to complete ‘

it. _B'e'ca«use the students were

friends.

Weingartner will be taking a
one-year leave and will return to
Pitt as a professor of philosophy.

When asked to comment on
Weingarter’s performance Posvar
said, "I would say he was, in
terms of his exercise of authority
versus.openness, [in the] middle
of the road. He invited some par-
ticipation, but I think to some ex-
tent he was also not as available
to his deans as some would have
-liked, but I'd say that's middle of
the road.” .

Donald Henderson, the present
vice provost, will replace Wein-
gartner in May.

JOHANNESBURC, South Afri-
ca (AP) — Four black detainees
on a hunger strike escaped yester-
day from a Johannesburg hospi-
tal, fled 38 miles to Pretoria and
sought refuge at the West Ger-
man embassy there, officials said.

The four men, who have been
held without charge for between
10 months and 23 months,
demanded the South African
government guarantee that they
and all other political detainees
will be freed.

”We have committed no
crime,” the escapees said in a
statement. ”We have been kept
in detention for so long that we
felt we had to embark on a life-
and—death hunger strike to drama-
tize our plight in detention and to
ultimately secure our immediate
release.”

West Germany's Foreign
Ministry said the four are in ”ad—
ministrative custody.” The em-
bassy in Pretoria said no decision
has been made about them.

The men said through the De-
tainees Aid Center that they be-
long to organizations affiliated
with the banned United

Democratic Front, the country's

They escaped from Hillbrow
Hospital in Johannesburg, where
they had spent five weeks being
treated for fasting, according to
the South African government in
their statement.

They did not disclose how they
escaped from the hospital and got
to the West German Embassy.

Explosives still ’high
risk’ for airlines

LONDON (AP) — The Trans-
port Department told airlines and
airports yesterday there is a ”high
and continuing risk” of more
devices like the bomb in a radio-
cassette player that destroyed Pan
Am Flight 103, killing 270
people.

The department said it sent a te-
lex as a reminder of its previous
warnings, which have been the
subject of controversy, and to
suggest new safety measures.
Transport officials would not
elaborate on the statement.

NEWS BRIEFS

Pressure grew for the govern-
ment to explain whether the
Flight 103 disaster on Dec. 21,
1988, could have been averted
with better dissemination of
warnings and information about
bombing equipment found be-
fore the explosion over Locker-
bie, Scotland.

Opposition politicians have
demanded that Transport Secre-
tary Paul Channon resign be-
cause of how he handled events
before the bombing, which killed
all 259 people on the Boeing 747
and 11 on the ground.

Staff Writer

Beth Nigro’s eyes were swollen
and red, and her skin was badly
burned when she entered a
friend's dorm room Friday af-
ternoon.

Beth, a senior English writing
major at Pitt, said she woke up
around three that morning. Her
eyes were burning, itching and
watering uncontrollably.

Beth normally has perfect sight,
but Friday her vision was blurry
and gray. She said she couldn't
even see to dial the phone.

Thursday afternoon, Beth and
a few friends were using a sun-
lamp in a Tower A room, hoping
to get an early start on their sum-
mer tans. ‘

Although she was not wearing
eye protection, Beth saysshe was
not looking directly at the sun-
lamp. She feared that the sun-

‘ lamp would somehow damage

her eyes.
Beth could hardly stand the
pain of blinking when she en-

" tered her friend's room, so her

friend called the Student Health
Service, where a nurse listened to
Beth’s symptoms and instructed
them to go to Presbyterian Hospi-
tal’s Eye and Ear Emergency
Center.

The nurse who greeted them at
the center took one look at Beth's
irritated eyes and burned skin and
confidently said, ”SunlamP»
right?”

Beth nodded.

”Are you a Pitt student?” the
nurse» asked. ' .

”Yes,” she answered.

”Usually we don't see this un-
til after April 1. Pitt students seem
to have an affinity for sunlamp
abuse,” the nurse told Beth and
her friend.

.While. it may not be common

knowledge, the temporary color-
ing gained from the use of a sun-
lamp or tanning salon can cause
far more problems than it's
worth. S

Because of the many risks in— ‘

volved, ”the practice of promot-
ing artificial suntan for cosmetic
purposes is not accepted by the
medical community,” according
to the journal of the American
Academy of Dermatology.

adds that UVA rays can cause
cataracts in the eyes of ex-
perimental mice.

_The journal says that the effect
ot sunbed rays to the surface of
the eyes is twice that of a com-
parable length of natural sunlight
exposure.

salons, simply wear eye protec-

tificial tanning, called UVA, are
much more concentrated than
those of natural sunlight. The
journal said that the dosages of
UVA rays ”vary greatly with
different tanning salon equip-
ment; therefore the customer has
no idea of the dose received.”

Sunlamps can cause temporary
and permanent damage to both
the user's eyes and skin, said the
journal.

Most commonly, eye damage

is limited to a burning of the cor-
nea, which causes ”dry spots” on
the eye's surface. As" in Beth's

case, this condition is extremely S

painful and is usually accompa-
nied with vision loss and nausea.
The irritation disappears after
several days, but may reoccur
with exposure to the sun.

”The doctor told me to wear

eye protection from Vniowwon _ g_
when I go out in the sun, or else

the irritation could keep reap-
pearing," Beth said.

Not all cases are temporary,
however. ”Extensive eye ex-
posure to UVA rays can, in some
cases, cause permanent sight

not wear protective goggles be-
cause of tan lines, or the ”rac-
coon effects,” they cause.

Skin cancer is another risk of ar-
tificial tanning methods.-
Although UVA rays alone may
not cause cancer, repeated ex-
posure to the rays can_ greatly in-
crease the risk of skin cancer from
ordinary sunlight, said the
journal.

There are also’ several other
risks involved for people with
certain skin types and medical
histories.

The journal suggests intervals
of at least 24 hours between each
exposure to UVA rays if someone
insists on using artificial tanning.
It also cautions people taking

vmedication to consult their doc-

tor before using sunlamps or tan-
ning salons.

«’-’-All these risks make the prac-
tice of using unnecessary UVA
rays for cosmetic purposes ques-
tionable at best,” says the journal.

The nurse showed Beth to an
examining rdom and gave her a
vision test and eyedrops for her
pain. She could barely make out

the larger letters.

The doctor who examined Beth
told her that she had damaged
the corneas of her eyes and that
she should keep them covered
until the pain subsided. He said
that he could see an actual line
on her eyes where they were ex-
posed to the sunlamp’s rays.

He also gave her two prescrip-
tions and told her to stay out of
the sunlightvfor several days.

’’I feel so stupid‘; I should have
known better,” Beth said as she
left the clinic.

The nurse smiled and told her
not to feel that way. She said that
last year they treated a group of
Pitt students who had decided to
have a "Florida party" -— com-
plete with sunlamps and no eye
protection. The nurse added that
the number of students who
come though with similar
problems is high, and grows as
summer gets closer.

.Was the burn Beth received,
which peeled anyway, worth the
pain and expense involved?

’’It’s just such a frightening
thing to lose your sight, even if
[it’s] only temporarily,” said Beth.
"I had no idea  that the sun-
lamp could do that to my eyes,
and I don't think many other peo-
ple would have known either.
Needless to say, l’ll be staying
away from [sunlamps] from now
on. There’s no way it's worth it.

”The people at Presby were:
great,” Beth said. ’’You really do
feel like an idiot after doing
something like that, but the nurse
made me feel a lot better. My
eyes still hurt and are a little blur-
ry yet. People tend to look at me
funny when I'm wearing-sun-
glasses inside, but the light hurts
my eyes.

everything is back to normal,”

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

Want to know how to win a
free spring break trip, make
money for Pitt’s scholarship fund
and get a chance to prove Pitt's
superiority over Penn State on na-
tional television?

Be a contestant on the new
game show College Mad House,
that's how.

”Col/ege Mad House is the
adult version of Double Dare,”
says Dana Keefer, the Pitt Pro-
gram Council's program coor-
dinator.

Double Dare is the popular
game show for kids in which
teams compete against each

version will feature competition
between traditional college rivals,
such as Pitt vs. Penn State.
Applications to audition for
College /\/lad House are available
at room M—3() of the William Pitt
Union. They are due by March

22 and must also be accompa—‘

nied by a photograph. The show
is being sponsored at Pitt by the
Pitt Program Council Recreation
Committee.

The producers of the show will
choose 35 applicants as semi-
finalists to be ”tested” at Pitt on
March 31.

The semi-finalists will be test-
ed in events similar to ones seen

One of the events used in the pi-

Finalists will be flown to Los

Angeles in August for the taping,

of the show.

Teams will be competing to
win prizes such as a spring break
trip to the Bahamas or Cancun,
cash for their university's scholar-
ship fund and, most important, to
prove which school really is the
”Beast of the East.”

Strong steps needed  
to prevent cheating  

On Friday, students in Bangladesh rioted for the right
to cheat on exams that determine college placement.
More than 200 students were injured in the demonstra-
tions, and more than 3,500 were expelled for their part
in the riots, according to The Pittburgh Press. Approxi-
mately 200 students forced teachers out of classrooms,

- while they copied information from books.
On a less bizarre note, the University (of Pittsburgh)
. Senate Council voted to approve revisions to the Univer-
sity Intergrity Guidelines, which address the problem
of cheating.

No injuries or arrests resulted from these changes,
which created stricter criteria for determining the cul-
pability of students accused of cheating.

The document makesit harder for faculty to take ac-
tion concerning allegations of cheating against students.
While it is good for students to have the benefit of the
doubt in university judicial circles, the problem of cheat-
ing is a serious one, and there is a need for faculty mem-
bers to have some power at hand to deal with students
who are taking an easy way out.

Since the college diploma has become such a power-
ful document in terms of employment opportunities and
upward mobility in the business world, it becomes vi-
tally important that this document be earned by the
student.

While we can console ourselves with the thought that
”cheaters never win” and tell ourselves that eventual’-
ly the person who has cheated will be tripped up by
the knowledge that he failed to obtain in school, that
is little consolation to the honest C-average graduate ,
who "loses a job opportunity to a dishonest A-average
student.

It seems just a bit more important to stop the_ problem
in the educational system, with strict regulation and
strong punishment, than to allow some to slip through
the holes. We would like to see the council strengthen
the faculty position in the Integrity Guidelines, rather
than end up talking about the one that got away.

Beer restrictions for  
baseball games wise

. The Pirates have decided that last year's restrictions
;  of alcohol consumption at baseball games (24—ounce
. beers and two beers to a patron "at a time) are not
 enough. ' - , ‘
, They have decided that, for this season, _beer sales
in the stands will end after the fifth inning, and beer
concession stands will close after the eighth (regardless
of extra innings). E
It is a good idea. It resolves some problems with row-
. diness, and more important, by curbing sales earlier in
1. the game, it helps to lessen the possibility of overin-
’ -dulgers driving home drunk after the game. With the
great ”American" association of beer and baseball, this
M decision is a courageous one, and the Pirates should
 g ‘be commended.) , ’ A . " ' ’ .. -" - '

PERSPECTIVE I

 

THE PITT NEWS

‘Drinking and the modern statesman

O

The final chapter of the ethics

saga on John G. Tower has been

written.

Of all the factors which led to
the rejection of John Tower as
secretary of defense for the Bush
administration, the alcohol-
related accusations crowned his

ultimate downfall. However, do ‘

these accusations, whether true
or false, pose a double standard?
Have other Senate members
been guilty of this same type of
charge? The answer to this ques-
tion is yes.

Massachusetts Sen. Teddy
Kennedy, a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee (the
committee which originally re-
jected Tower, leading to the
Senate floor debate) opposed the
Tower nomination. He was in—
volved in the Chappaquiddick in—

PAUL G.
KENGOR

‘ cident, in which,-as a result of his

drinking and driving, a young
woman was. killed. Kennedy
waited for hours before he report-
ed the accident.

Also, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee who
spearheaded the Democratic as-

. sault against Tower, was involved

in a hit-and—run accident in I964,
to which he admitted. he had
been drinking and driving at the

-grime.

These are only two examples.
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater
has asserted, ”If they chased ’ev—
ery man or woman out of
[Washington, D.C.] that was
shacke up with somebody else or
had gotten drunk — there’d be no
government.” —

Of course, secretary of defense
is an office in which abstinence
from spirits of any type is essen-
tial. However, Tower pledged
that he would not touch alcohol
if confirmed. If he were to break
this promise, the Senate and the
press (and probably another
anonymous source somewhere
along the way) would have wast-
ed no time in providing us with
the details. Indeed, they would
watch him like hawks. _

Should we have trusted Tow-
er"s pledge? Sam Nunn didn't
think so. However, it's ironic that
Nunn, in reply to his 1964 hit-
and—run episode, claims that he
learned a ”valuable lesson” and,
in essence, wouldn't take part in
this type of activity again. If the
Senate can accept Nunn’s word,
then why not Tower's? After all,
FBI reports and medical records
proved that Tower had no drink-
ing or alcohol-induced physical
problems. Furthermore, Mr. Tow-
er had served 24 years in the
Senate and once had the same
position.that Nunn now holds so
authoritatively.

, As Kansas Sen. Robert Dole,’

said, this Senate rejection of Tow-
er was not necessarily partisan
(by the Democrats), but was
”Nunn-partisan,” implying that
what Nunn so pertinaciously
decided, the Senate Democrats
agreed to do.

Has there ever been a tenden-
cy for this country to be patient
with possible alcohol abusers,
and if so, was it rewarded?

— - Weiknow that former British

Prime Minister Winston Churchill .

‘was a key force in the Allied vic-
tory. of World War II. ‘According
to William Manchester's The Last
Lion, Churchill started his day
with three, ounces of Johnny
Walker Red, whichhe sipped till

lunch. By late evening, he had
consumed two or three scotches,
several glasses of champagne, at
leasttwo brandies and a highball.
There was always alcohol in his
bloodstream, and Churchill once
commented, ’’All I can say is that
I have taken more out of alcohol
than alcohol has taken out of
me."

The great Civil War hero,
General Ulysses S. Grant, was a
notorious alcoholic in his pre-war
days, but went on to become an
excellent general and a fine presi-
dent. We can reflect on an in—
quiry by President Lincoln, in
which he wished that he knew
where Grant got his whiskey, as
he would be ”glad to prescribe
some of it for some of his other
generals.”

We'll never know whether
John Tower was of the same
caliber as the respected prime
minister orthe great general.
Likewise, the question of his pos-
sible alcohol abuse and its con-
sequences will always be
debatable. This ‘nomination
should have been objectively
judged with these considerations,
but unfortunate_ly, it ended up be-
ing lodged in partisan confines.

The Tower rejection not only
lacked certainty, but it was also
hypocritical. I'm left to conclude
that if our history were comprised
of men with the pervading judg-
emental attitudes of Sam Nunn,
then men such as Winston Chur-

chilland Ulysses S. Grant would

have never left the starting gate.

.,.Please, Gene, Iet.Trek rest inlpeace

Yesterday, I gave you the three
plots which seem to repeat them-
selves over and over again
throughout the hellish run of that
evil television show‘entitled Star

Trek: The Next Generation. T0-

or

*3

day, for your enlightenment and
amusement, I-will putforth to you
the subplot that threatens to swal-
low the show whole, and how it
is indicative of-the main problem
thatthe show has.

In the 705, Gene Roddenber-
ry produced a TV show about an
android thatwanted to be hu-
man. It was called The Questor
Tapes and to put it bluntly, it
sucked. Mike Farrell, of
M*A*S*H fame, played the hu-
man designer of the machine,
Questor, who tried to lead the
hapless robot down the path to
that bird of paradise: humanity.

The show was, of course, a dis-
mal failure. But its ‘ghost lives on.’

The new USS Enterprise has an
android on the crew. A robot
named, in a stroke of creative
genius, Data. Data wants to be
human .— deja vu -— and he will
try just about anything to achieve
this goal. This includes endless
trips to the holodeck, endless dis-
cussion with crew members
about his flaws, and endless bits
of advice from some strange
character, played by Whoopi
Goldberg (truly a shining exam-«
ple of humanity) in the starship’s
littlenightlclub/bar._ ; ‘ .

 

  

‘- -to run ,ai.p|_anet’s“ Computer sys-

  

One of the _ever-popular holo-

ideck trips included visiting a

computer simulation of the
greatest 20th" century comedian,
played (ironically enough) by Joe
Piscopo, who tried to explain to
this also hapless robot what hu-
mor is.- I I ‘
Recently, the ship acquired a

JOHN
BERGER

new doctor whose earthy man-
ner, odd face and crusty little
barbs are both helpful and hin-
dering to Data in his attempts to
be human — ooooh, deja vu
again! . ' ' ’
_No, no, Doctor McCoy isn't
recapitulating his first episode
c'ameo on the program. This doc-
tor is a woman, and she only
looks like him. She isn't really
him. Exactly. Well, she is and she
isn't. Anyway, she tries really
hard, but it comes across as if she
had hardly tried. ,
And thi_s_Ieads us to the real
problem with this sad excuse for
a continuation of Star Trek. It isn't
just that the writers are full of
dumb, bad and usually borrowed
ideas. After all, the original Trek
featured such lame plots as flying
flesh pancakes that infect peo-

ple’s nervous systemsand beau- "

tiful aliens who use Spock's brain

    

tem. The first Trek made it work

. because of the characters.

And shining even more bright-
ly than the other great characters
was the ”Terrific Trio” —— Captain
James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr.
Leonard McCoy. ‘ ‘ v

They had an air of reality to '

‘them. Kirk was the hot-tempered
but fair commander of the star-

- ship; Spock, the cold, analytical

one, with deeply buried emo-
tions; McCoy, the emotional, sin-
cere Healer.

They played off each others’
weaknesses, ultimately becoming
more than the sum of their parts.
Theyiwere balanced, full of life,
and full of emotion. The current
crew couldn't generate enough
emotion to match an episode.of
Hawaii Five-0. ' ’

These original characters were
amazing. And they can't be

cloned, nor can they be simply

matched. It was a mistake to even
try. _.

The combination of writers
who could deal with these

characters, actors who could por- ‘

tray them and directors who
could play up to them visually -
jt was once in-a lifetime. It was
good. Now it's gone.

. To Gene Roddenberry: Let
them restin peace.

   

Rallyround, boys;
let's have a protest!

Poking my head out of the warm comfort of my sleeping bag
had the same effect as touching a hot stove with the tip of my
finger. The air was cold and misty, and after feeling it once,
I never wanted to do it again. ,

As I curled up at the bottom of my sleeping bag like a fetus
in its mother's nurturing womb, I heard someone shouting,
”Wake up, my committed soldiers. It is time for us to do bat-
tle.” I contemplated a coup d’etat. ’

When I reluctantly rose, I

saw that the rest of the group

was already packing away

their belongings. My accom- 

fooling with his lenses and tak-

ing light readings with a small device which looked like a tran-
sistor radio with a small disk attached to it.

I had come to the campus of Dixville College in Dixville, Pa., If

to cover a protest rally for the Milton Times-Dispatch. Milton
is about 10 miles to the east of Dixville. I had decided to join
these self-proclaimed revolutionaries in a 24-hour vigil the night
before their ra|_|y so I could gather some interesting quotes from
the group's leader, Chris Hart. A .
Hart is a throwback from the '60s. Now 40 years old, he took

part in various protests against the Vietnam War when he at- "S
tended college at the University of Michigan. As I interviewed‘ .

him under a large, black, dead tree that morning, he told me
horror stories about how he had been beaten by police for pro-
testing The War. As he spoke of his younger days, hestared
up at the sky in a contemplative manner. Rather than recalling

painful memories, he seemed to be reminiscing. I expected him‘

to say, ”Those were the good old days.” But he didn't.
Hart's trance was broken by a ski_nny man with greasy hair

and a greasy beard who wandered over to us. He bent down’

and whispered into Hart's ear. At this, Hart rose and waved for
the group of I 1 people to gather round. The march was about

to begin. I lit a cigarette. -

These revolutionaries were protesting the campus cafeteria.’s -
serving of quiche to students. To Hart and his followers,“qu_ich_e ‘J

represented elitism in America. This was, to them, the same

philosophy which has led to homelessness and starvation in this  ;-. 
country. There are no homeless people in Dixville, a rural .corn-  
munity located in a place called Sunshine Valley, but Hart knew _;_

that they were out there, somewhere, in this cruel world.
Hart lit a cigarette. After he led a pep rally to prepare the group

for the march, heexcused himself from the group and motioned-, s

tome to follow him.

He led me into the bushes behind Bald Hall, in front ofnwhich

the group had spent the night. He threw his lit cigarette onto

the wet leaves and urinated on it. He zippedup his army-green:   ii-
trousers, looked at me, smiled, and then walked back to the»
group. I had no idea what that was supposed to mean. e_ 

As the group began its march to the student cafeteria-, they _, 
held signs and banners with slogans such as, "A Real Democra-  }
cy Doesn't Eat Quiche," and shouted poetic lines like, ”Down g. 5

With Quiche. Up With The People!”

When the group reached the front entrance of the cafeteria, if I

they fell silent. Theysimply stood there with their fists in the

air. In unison-, all 11 people fell to the ground, blocking the 1 '_ r-V
. entrance to the building. . . ' _ 

By now it was lunchtime, and hungry students beganto gather
at the cafeteria. The students were shocked at what theysaw. 
They didn't seem to feel guilty as Hart had hoped they wouldf
— when they saw the banners." They were outraged. Some students?‘
tried to enter the cafeteria, .and stepped o_n the bodies of the «:
protesters. The protesters tried to trip them and shouted pro--f
fanities at the ”e|itist pigs.". ' ’  

I was writing ferociously, and I could hear the photographer's,  v

camera clicking rapidly. V

The Dixville and campus police forces arrived. A delivery 
truck was pulling around to the front of the building. Hart I,
jumped up onto the high, thick cement railing on theright side V _ I
of the cafeteria front door. He took a few quick stepslandg I

jumped toward the welcoming asphalt.

He sc-reamed something whilehe‘ flew through theair, but“ 1’.
I couldn't decipher it. He bounced around underthe truck like T

a ragdoll, then became lodged under. the right rear tire.» - 

It was an ugly sight. There was blood and torn clothing every-.,;’
where. I couldn't stop staring, though. I was probably cataton-Q.
sic or something. I didn't think or do or say" anything. '  .-

I looked up from Hart's torn body and stared at the truck. ;_ -

The side of the truck read, ”The Heavenly Kitchen. Serving Dix’-

Counselor cites methods to prevent procrastination

”I’m ‘going under. I just can't
seem to get anything done on
time. I know what I have to do,
but I just keep putting things off.
The less I do, the worse I feel.
Why do I do this to myself?”

in a recent survey of Pitt stu-
dents, procrastination was the
No.1 student concern. Over 60
percent of the undergraduates
surveyed’ felt that they could
benefit from some help in this
area, so those of you who put
things off are not alone.

The causes of procrastination
are varied. Some students can
only energize themselves when

the task is especially meaningful
to them; others avoid beginning
a project because they fear
failure. Students also procras-
tinate because of a lack of confi-
dence in their skills, as well as for
many other reasons.

It might be helpful for you to
make some educated guesses
about the underlying reason or
reasons for your procrastination.
If your problem is severe, you
may need specialized counseling
assistance along with self-
analysis. Self—understanding,
however achieved, is an impor-
tant first step toward recovery.

your typical procrastination tac-
tics. For example, do you consis-
tently underestimate the size of a
task; write and re-write the open-
ing paragraph of a paper; OF Fe‘
ward yourself with a nap before
you start to work?

DR. ROBERT
GALLAGHER

Think about the tactics and ex-
cuses you employ to avoid doing
your work. Write them down and
add them to your list as you dis-
cover more. The more you own
up to these self-defeating strate-
gies, the less powerful they
become.

"Another major reason for
procrastination is that people set
huge, vague goals which are vir-
tually unreachable, then become
anxious and overwhelmed — and
the procrastination begins.

You will increase your chances
of success if you establish small
and well-defined goals. Saying ’'’I
want to stop procrastinating” IS
not enough. You need to set up

one measurable goal at a time, es-
tablish a time frame for accom-
plishing it, and follow some
approximation of the following
steps:

0 Visualize how you will do
the task step by step in your
mind.

0 Determine how much time

I you will work on the task each

day and stick to it.

0 Do not wait until you ”feel”
like getting started. Stick with
your plan. »

0 Watch yourself —— refrain
from making your usual excuses
to avoid working.

0 Focus on one step at a time.

0 Get beyond the first obstacle.
Don't let the first problem you
encounter demoralize you.

0 Reward yourself after you
have made some progress.

0 Remember, your effort
doesn't have to [be perfect. Even
an effort that does not meetwith
instant success is valuable, and
every effort is worthwhile.

_ Viet Phom/The Pitt News
Resigning Provost Rudolph H. Weingartner ‘

0 At the end of the time.peri—
od, review what you have ac-
complished, note the things you
did well and the things you could
have done better, and incor-
porate what you have learned
into your next assignment.

There are many other-ways to
attack a procrastination problem.
A number of approaches are
described in the book Procrasti-
nation by Burka and Urin that is
available in the Counseling

v Center Library.

Whatever‘ approach you .use,
try to avoid the guilt trips when
things don't go as well as
planned. Guilt only increases
your anxiety and worsens the
procrastination problem. Accept
your failures, analyze what went
wrong, and remain determined to
do better.

Lacrosse club splits
first two games of year

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Pitt's men's lacrosse team split
its first two matches of the 1989
season, beating Cumberland
(Maryland) on March 16 before
losing to Bethany Sunday after-
noon by a 6-4 margin.

The Panthers, who compete on
the club level, jumped out to a
4-1 lead early on before having
to fight off a tenacious effort by
the Cumberland team‘~rat Pitt
Stadium last Thursday. The visi-
tors could not narrow the margin
‘to less than 5-3, and at that point
Pitt scored two more goals before
Cumberland managed to tally the
final points.

Pitt employed a unique strate-
gy for the game, using six
defenseman at times to put added
pressure on the Cumberland
offense. That left only three at-
tackers for the hosts.

"’That is probably the biggest

thing we'll have to work on,

throughout the season,” Pitt
defenseman Michael Neuman
said. "It was hard to .-get in the

The Panther Hockey Club end-
ed its season with a fourth-place

finish in the Belmont Complex

College Invitational on Sunday,
losing 6-3 to the Delaware Blue
Hens on Saturday and 3-2 to the
Dayton Flyers on Sunday.

The Panthers squad was sorely

. lacking in only one aspect on

Sunday —— personnel. Only nine
of 14 Panther players penned in
for the game showed up. Also ab-
sent from the game was Panther
Coach Jeff Bele. James Owens

Sr., the Panthers general
manager, stepped in for the miss-
ing coach. 9

Brian Owens, the Panthers cap-
tain, attributed their lack of play-
ers to hangovers. /

”They were all hung over,"

»l Owens’ said. "I have no idea

where they are. They're probably
justsleeping. The game was a lit-

54, heavily-'_

transition to offense that way.

"At first I thought the game was
going to be a blowout. I thought
we were a much more talented
team than they were. But Cum-
berland stuck in there and I think
success got to our heads a little
early.

"We became complacent and
we started forcing things and
looking for spectacular goals.
Our offense did an exceptional
job, though. They kept the ball in
their possession, and that made
our job as defensemen a lot
easier.”

Spencer Borisoff led the way I

for Pitt with two goals. Erik We-
ber, Mike Ross, Harper Watters,
Lee Stember, Steve Hudson, and
Phil Preston also scored for the
Panthers, while Weber contribut-
ed two assists and Hudson and
Preston knotched one apiece.
Neuman, Jeff Johns, Greg
Shockley, and Tony Leotta also
contributed heavily defensively.

well for Pitt in the next contest,

a little under the weather.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — Dwane
Casey, the principal figure in
the NCAA’s investigation of
the Kentucky basketball pro-
gram, resigned Monday as as-
sistant coach of the Wildcats.

Casey's resignation came
one day after Eddie Sutton
resigned as head coach of the
beleaguered program.

Meanwhile, Kentucky
spokesman Bernie Von-
derheide said the school was
forming a search committee to
find a successor to Sutton.

"Athletic director-elect C.M.
Newton will be on the com-
mittee, but other committee
members have not been
firmed up yet," he said.

Newton, the basketball
coach at Vanderbilt, officially
becomes Kentucky's athletic
director April 1.

Vonderheide said a timeta-
ble has not been set for nam-
ing a new coach.

In a statement released
through his attorney, Joe Bill
Campbell of Bowling Green,

Ky., Casey said, "I think it only

Casey resigns from Kentucky

appropriate that I resign my
position as assistant men's
basketball coach at the
University of Kentucky. It is
with much sadness and regret
that I leave. . . I love this
university, its basketball pro-
gram, players, students and
fans.” J

Sutton’s other assistants,
James Dickey and Jimmy

E Dykes, could not be reached
for comment.

Casey was mentioned in
seven of the 18 allegations
lodged against the university
by the NCAA.

But Casey, 31, who played
on Kentucky's 1978 national
championship team, reiterated
his innocence in the probe.

‘'1 have- never intentionally
or knowingly violated any
NCAA rule or regulation,” he
said in his statement. "I have
conducted my professional
and personal life withdignity,
honor and pride.

’'I did not put any money in
any Emery package; I did not
offer any players money or
cars; I have never asked any-
one outside the university
structure to assist me in recruit-

ing; and I have not provided
the university or the NCAA
with any false or misleading
information. I am confident
that the NCAA hearing will
vindicate me."

Casey said, however, "that
the controversy surrounding
the‘ basketball program has af-
fected his future.

”My dream of coaching at
this university and eventually
as a head coach at a major
university has been des-
troyed,” he said. "I'm terribly
hurt, and the pain I feel is be-
yond description."

Gov. Wallace Wilkinson
said Monday that he respect-
ed Sutton’s decision, but
declined to say whether he
agreed with it. In an interview
on national television Sunday,
Sutton had ‘thanked Wilkinson
for his support.

Sutton said Monday that he
hoped tocontinue coaching,
but first was going to spend 9
some time with his family. ‘

alternate defensemen with

"Everyone turned in a solid ef-

hits. The Pirates had only one hit
off Don Heinkel, a non-roster
pitcher who started for St. Louis.

The ‘Cardinals, facing Rick

QReed in the sixth, scored the

game's" first run when'Jim Linde- -

man hit a fielder’s choice force-
out after singles by Jose Oquendo
and Denny Walling. ' _ .
Pittsburgh tied the game 1-1 in
the eighth on a walk, forceout
and Barry Bonds’ two—out double
off Steve Peters. Jones batted for
Peters in St. Louis’ ninth andthe
singled. Nelson Simmons singled

.9 off Terry Tatis’ glove at first base,

and Todd Zeile’s sacrifice bunt
moved the runners up before Luis
Alicea was walked intentionally
to load the bases. ,

Fitzgerald's winning single off
loser Jim Gott, the Pirates’ fourth
pitcher, went off the glove of
third baseman Jeff King to give
the Cardinals, 12-5, their seventh
victory in their last eight games.
Pittsburgh's exhibition record
moved to 9-9.

Terry Pendleton made his first A

spring start at third base for St.
Louis, contributing two strong
defensive plays. Manager Whitey
Herzog said that Pendleton, who
underwent arthroscopic left-knee
surgery last fall, vi"/ill bat twice on
Tuesday.

The two-run homer by Herr,
his first in a Phillies uniform since
coming in an offseason deal with
the Minnesota Twins, made it 4-2
in the third.

New York pulled within 4-3 on
Howard Johnson’s solo homer off
Freeman, Johnson's first home
run of spring.

But the Phillies starter helped
himself in the bottom of the in-
ning with a two—out triple, scor-
ing on a single by Dernier to
make it 5-3. Dernier is getting ex-
tended playing time in center
field because starting center
fielder Juan Samuel suffered a
strained left hamstring in Satur-

';'§3‘%:’’'. ’

Graduate 1986

After four terrific years at Pitt‘s Nursing School, I
couldn’t believe it; I was finally going to be a “Nurse".

The excitement of embarking on a wonderful new career '

was mixed with the fear of the unknown. The staff on
3 Main were, and still are, so‘ supportive as is my Unit
Director, Margaret Barnyk. The never- ending conﬁdence
they have in me means so much. No questions are “too
silly” to ask. I never felt like I was “alone”. Someone
was always there to help with patient care, to answer all
my many questions or tojust listen and care. I had never
been anywhere before where so many people wanted you
to succeed and grow. -

I couldn’t believe the opportunities for personal as well
as professional growth offered me at Shadyside. From my
first moments at Shadyside, I felt welcomed and want-
ed. I’ve learned that each new experience is an opportu-
nity for growth, not something to fear. The caring
atmosphere makes it so much easier to face these
challenges with a positive attitude, not a negative one. It’s
a wonderful feeling knowing that when I go to work, no

_ matter what new challenge awaits me, I’m not alone.

I have never felt like a number at Shadyside. I have
always been made to feel like a “true person” as well as
a professional. I know that I’m an important part of the
care giving team.

I’ve made so many wonderful new friends at Shady-
side. I even brought one of my classmates with me from
Pitt. I only wish more of my classmates could share the
wonderful opportunities awaiting them at Shadyside.

From my first moments at Shadyside, I knew this was
the place to be; I knew I was home.

  Walters
injured
before
testimony

By Lindsey Tanner

Associated Press Writer

CHICAGO -— Defendant Nor-
by Walters suffered an arm inju—.
ry en route to the courtroom-
Monday, forcing a one-day post-
ponement in the trial of two
sports agents accused of defraud-
i_ng_u/niversities and threatening
athletes. -

Walters was riding the elevator
to the 17th floor courtroom when
he_ was accidently knocked to the ~
floor by a cart, defense attorney
Dan Webb said.

He was taken to Northwestern -9

‘Memorial Hospital for examina-
tion, and U.S. Districtjudge Ge-
orge M. Marovich delayed the
trial until the afternoon. Walters,
however, remained at the hospj— _
tal when the court session was
scheduled to resume, forcing the
judge to postpone testimony un-

til. Tuesday. 9

Outside the courtroom,
Walters was heard telling a med-
ical crew he was in pain and felt
dizzy. _

”He’s in good condition. He's
being evaluated by the doctors
but there's no broken bones.
He'll probably be released,”
hospital spokeswoman‘ Elizabeth
Crown said.

After sending theajury h_ome,3_'ﬂ?

Marovich ruled on motions to

limit the cross-examination of

two government.witnesses ex-
V pectedvto testify this week — Ron‘
Morris of the Chicago Bears and
Edwin ~Simmo_ns, a former
University of Texas football play-
er'who never made it to the pros.

1 The government contends Sim-
mons passed on a threat from
Walters’ co-defendant, Lloyd, .
Bloom, to another player.

Defense attorneys plan to try to_
impeach Morris’ credibility by
bringingup under-the-table pay-
ments he allegedly received from
Southern Methodist University
representatives who recruited
him to play college football.

Marovich said the defense has
”a right to ask ifhe thought it was
a violation of rules and if he
reported it,” partially denying
U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas’
motion.‘

But Marovich granted Valukas"
motion to restrictinquiries into a
1986 incident in which Simmons
ended up.nud_e in an Austin,
Texas, backyard. _ A

Webb, an attorney for Bloom,
' said Simmons told police at the

time ”his mind or memory had
been addled by marijuana.” The
attorney contended that would
have bearing on whether Sim- —
mons could accurately recall his '

Attorneys had planned Mon_-
day to summon Tony.Woods of
the Seattle Seahawks, a lineback-
er who played college football at
Pittsburgh, to the stand. Woods
was expected to testify Tuesday.

Monday's grapefruit 4 Rose

league roundup

(AP) — The Baltimore Orioles
ended an experiment on Monday
when they sent Juan Bell to the
minor leagues and moved Cal
Ripken Jr. back to shortstop.

Ripken, who began his career
in Baltimore in 1981 at third
base, made two errors this spring.
He has played 67 innings, all at
third base, and did not make
Monday's trip to West Palm
Beach for a game against Mon-
treal, won by the Expos 1-O.

’’I’d always said I would play
wherever they wanted me to,”
Ripken said. ”I just wanted to
know where I would be. I've also
got seven years of my career in-
vested at shortstop.”

Bell, the younger brother of
Toronto's George Bell, got ample
opportunity this spring. He
played 99 innings, more than
anyone else, all at shortstop.

He made six errors in 14
games, and because of charitable
spring-training scoring, he didn't
get a few more. Most of his mis-
cues were on easy plays, the kind
Ripken makes routinely.’

’’I didn't play as well as I can,”
Bell said. ”I’m disappointed, but

6 I'll work hard.”

Blue Jays 4, Astros 0

John Cerutti continued his out-
standing spring by pitching a
three-hitter over five innings as
Toronto beat Houston 4-0 to im-
prove its exhibition record to
14-4. In 13 innings pitched this
spring, Cerutti, 3-O, has given up
just one run on nine hits.

Jesse Barfield and Bob Brenly

9each had two hits and a run bat-

ted in for Toronto.
Royals 13, Red Sox 8
Larry Owen broke a tie with a
seventh-inning sacrifice fly and
Kansas City added six more runs
off relievers Dennis Lamp and
Tom Bolton en‘ route to a 13-8
victory over Boston. Jim Eisen-
reich led Kansas City's 16-hit at-
tack with a triple and two singles,
with each contributing to a run.
Boston's Dennis ’’Oil Can”
Boyd gave up four runs and five
hits and walked two, throwing 75
pitches in just four innings.
Dodgers 6, Braves 5 '
Mike Scioscia hit a pinch
homer with one out in the bottom
of the ninth inning to give Los An-
geles a 6-5 victory over Atlanta.
Rookie outfielder Chris
Cwynn, brother San Diego star
Tony Gwynn, hit a homer and_
two doubles for the Dodgers to

raise his spring average to .500-
0 Giants 11, Cubs 5

Kevin Mitchell had two hits,
scored twice and drove, in three
runs as San Francisco beat the
Cubs.

Padres 7, Brewers 1

Bruce Hurst pitched six score-
less innings allowing four hits and
striking out six to lead San Diego
past Milwaukee.

Sandy Alomar Jr. doubled
twice and drove in three runs and
Carmelo Martinez hit his fifth
homer of the spring for the
Padres.

Reds 4, Tigers 3

Terry McGriff drove in_ two
runs with a sacrifice fly and a
homer, leading Cincinnati over
Detroit.-

Four Cincinnati pitchers shut
the Tigers out on three hits until
the. ninth, when John Franco
came on to give up four hits and
all three runs. Franco struck out
Gary Pettis with two runners on
base to end the game.

Agents——

Walters, 58, and Lloyd Bloom,
429, are charged with defrauding
seven major universities by sign-
ing athletes to contracts before
their college eligibility. had
expired.

The agents also are accused of
using cash to persuade the ath-
letes to sign the contracts, and
threatening players with physical
harm from an admitted mobster
if they tried to back out of the
deals. .

Last week, the mobster,
Michael Franzese, said he loaned
Walters and Bloom money to get

Rose has said. ”I own a couple

Rose has denied reports that he
