UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Pitt healing clinic
set to begin work

By Blake DePastino
For The Pitt News

Presbyterian—University Hospi-
tal and the University of Pitts-
burgh have collaborated to
develop a clinic for patients with
wounds that will not heal.

The Wound Healing/Limb
Preservation Clinic at the Falk
Clinic is a joint program between
the departments of Dermatology
and Surgery at Presby and the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine where persistent
wounds can be evaluated and
treated through various and often
innovative techniques.

Codirecting the clinic are Bri-
an V. Jegasothy, M.D., professor

and chairman of dermatology at
Presby and the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine and
Marshall Webster, M.D., director
of Presby’s Peripheral Vascular
Laboratory and professor of sur-
gery, also at Pitt's School of
Medicine.

Prior to the creation of the clin-
ic, non—healing wounds were
dealt with by altering the surface
of the wound to aid the body's
natural healing process. But at the
Wound Healing/Limb Preserva-
tion Clinic, through new and
previously unavailable proce-
dures, more thorough treatment
can be applied to greatly lower
the necessity for amputation.

Drowning incident
mars celebration

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

Tragedy marred an otherwise
successful Fourth of July show
when an unidentified man
drowned in the Ohio River.

According to Allegheny
County deputy coroner Edward
Capretta, ”A black male in his

‘early twenties was pronounced

dead at Allegheny General
Hospital at 9:36 p.m. Monday
night. Cause of death is listed as
drowning, with manner
unknown. He was recovered
from the Ohio River near the
West End bridge at approximate-
ly 8:35 p.m. Pittsburgh Police
Homicide is attempting to iden-
tify the deceased at this time.”
As of press time, no informa-
tion was available regarding the
presence of drugs or alcohol in
the deceased’s system, and homi-

New med

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Today's medical technology
and specialization is constantly
improving. Physicians’ ethics
however, remain controversial.

The Vira l. Heinz Endowment
recently awarded a grant of
$445,000 to a new training pro-
gram designed to better educate
physicians on medical ethics
through clinical experience.

The Clinical Ethics Training
Program, sponsored by Pitt's
Center for Medical Ethics, will
train senior medical students,
residents and fellows in medical

cide detectives had not disco-
vered his identity through the
corpse’s fingerprints. It is also un-
certain whether he jumped or
was pushed.

Bill Backa, public relations
coordinator for Pittsburgh's
Department of Parks and Recre-
ation said, ”The police are es-
timating that 150,000 people
were in Point State Park Monday
night to enjoy the symphony and
the fireworks. An additional
70,000 onlookers were along the
river in North Side, which is also
a city park. ‘

”The whole four day weekend
of events was dedicated to the
memory of the late Mayor
Richard Caliguiri. His wifeleanne
enjoyed the symphony and was
very honored by the events. Both
of them were fans of the Pitts-
burgh Symphony.”

ethics and will accept its first stu-
dents in the fall.

According to Dr. Kenneth F.
Schaffner, Center co-director, stu-
dents of the program will be re-
quired to analyze difficult ethical
decisions through treating pa-
tients.

”There is less emphasis on the
classroom,” said Schaffner. ”Stu-
dents will have an integrated
amount of experience.”

Students will be trained
through ethics rounds, similar to
daily work rounds on any medi-
cal service, ethics case consulta-
tions and a twice-weekly
seminar.

According to law Professor
Alan Meisel, another codirector
of the Center, current problems

involving physicians’ ethical de-

cisions involve communication
between physicians and patients.

’’In the past, there were
problems with legal liability,’’
said Meisel. ’’Problems are now
interpersonal ones, such as get-
ting family members to under-
stand when a patient will not
recover.”

The program's training will in-
clude areas of geriatric medicine,
artificial organ investigation, or-
gan transplantation, resuscitation
medicine and experimental
cancer treatment programs.

”This is a time for closeness
and communication,” said
Schaffner. ” One of the problems
is that there is a lot of complex
[medical] technology, a lot of

specialists, and this increases the
possibility of fragmentation and
lack of communication.”

Schaffner stressed that many
medical questions pose dilem-
mas for physicians. ”The problem
is not people, but knowledge of
issues,” he said.

”Medical ethics — like medi-
cine, pediatrics, surgery and
other areas of medical practice -
is too abstract when relegated
solely to the classroom,” said
Meisel. ’’It is no more desirable
for students to learn medical
ethics in this way than it would
be for surgeons to learn surgery

Pentagon says Iranian plane used military channel

WASHINGTON (AP)—— The Irani-
an airliner shot down by a U.S.
Navy missile was transmitting in-
formation on two radio channels,
including one ”identified with
F-14s" flown by the Iranian air
force, the Pentagon said Tuesday.

The fact the plane's trans-
ponder was using a military chan-
nel helped lead to the conclusion
aboard the cruiser Vincennes that
the ship was about to be attacked,
said Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard.

That knowledge, Howard said,
was a ’’substantial factor” in
Capt. Will C. Rogers lll’s decision
to launch two missiles toward the
jet.

”The signals that the Vincennes
were receiving were signals
previously identified with F-145,”
Howard said.

He said he was releasing the in-
formation about the transmission
on a military channel to support
the statements of Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, that the Vincennes
fired its missiles because it
thought it was attacking a military
target.

Howard told reporters that
there are still a large number of
unanswered questions about Sun-
day's incident, in which the Ira-

nian airbus A-300 was shot down
over the Strait of Hormuz.
The Iranian plane, with 290

persons aboard, had just taken off "

from Bandar Abbas, an airfield
also used by Iranian military
planes, Howard noted.

As the Iranian jetliner flew
toward the Vincennes, the
plane's transponder was sending
out signals through two channels,
Howard said. He identified them
as ”mode 3" and ”mode 2.”

According to Howard, ”mode
3" is a commonly used commer-
cial channel which is also some-
times used by military planes.
Howard said he did not specifi-
cally know what information the
jetliner was transmitting on
”mode 3.”

But ”mode 2,” according to
Howard, ”is peculiar to military
aircraft.” He said, ”no commer-
cial airlines use mode 2.”

The ”mode 2" transmitting
device ”is a specific piece of
equipment that has to be put on”
a plane, Howard said.

The signals received by the
Vincennes through ”mode 2"
had been identified with Iranian
F-14s in the past year, Howard
said.

Man suicidal after
death of daughter

(AP) — A Pittsburgh man threa-
tened to kill himself Tuesday af-
ter his 2-year-old daughter was
scalded to death, police said.

The body of Lorrene Walker
was found in bed, while steam-
ing hot water overflowed from
the tub in the bathroom.

Police said the girl's father, Er-
nest ”Pee Wee” Walker, held a
knife to his chest and threatened
suicide when a building superin-
tendent entered the apartment to
check on water neighbors said
was leaking to floors below.

Walker clutched a knife and
said he was going to kill himself
because the little girl was dead,
police said.

Union claims state
condones violence
HARRISBURG (AP) — A striking
union filed unfair labor practice

charges against the state Tuesday,
claiming it is bargaining in bad

faith, threatening employees and
condoning violence against pick-
eters by managers.

PSSU, which has 12,000 mem-
bers, went on strike Friday. Mem-
bers are unhappy with a
two-tiered vacation plan and the
Casey administration's proposed
changes in pay scales.

In its filing with the labor
board, the second-largest union
for state employees alleged that
a manager drove over a picketer’s
foot at the state office building in
Philadelphia and that a pregnant
picketer was assaulted by a
manager at state offices in
Reading.

The union also claimed the
state has unlawfully threatened to
discipline workers who join the
strike.

House passes tough
bill on drug dealers

HARRISBURG — The House on
Tuesday overwhelmingly ap-
proved a bill that would impose
a mandatory 10-year jail sentence
on adults who recruit minors into
the trafficking and sale of drugs.

The bill is geared toward crack-
ing down on adults who entice
minors to participate in the low-
er levels of drug distribution

Apparently, drug dealers see
the minors as a way to skirt law
enforcement efforts and avoid
high labor costs.

An amendment to the bill,
which was approved 130-53,
would boost the minimum age
required to purchase tobacco
products from 16 to 18.

Meese resigns after ,

ethics investigation

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Attor-
ney General Edwin Meese Ill,
ensnarled for months in an inves-
tigation of his ethics, announced
Tuesday that he is resigning at the
end of this month or early in Au-
gust. He took the step after in-
dependent counsel James McKay
filed his report on his investiga-
tion into Meese’s conduct in
office.

Meese said ”false allegations

have been put to rest” by “I

McKay's report, which was not
made public.

He said that ”with the burden
of false allegations now lifted,”
he would look ahead to his return
to private life.

Pitt News gets media advisor

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Growing up in the suburbs of
Chicago, James Tynen found
himself with a love of journalism
but also a bit intimidated by the
stereotypical movie journalists.
Today, however, he finds himself
among the likes of the Cary Grant
and Pat O'Brien newspapermen
of the past, as he assumes the role

of media advisor of The Pitt
News.
"I always wanted to be a writer

of some kind. I was always at—'

tracted to the field of journalism,
but somehow I always thought it
was for the reporters you see in
the old movies.  But, as I grew
older and more mature I learned
a little bit more about it,  I in-
vestigated it and decided it was
for me,” Tynen said.

Tynen said the ”dai_ly bread
and butter, nuts and bolts"

I philosophy of journalism was an

attractive attribute of newspaper
work.

Of The Pitt News, Tynen com-
mented on the admirable efforts
of the newspaper over the last
year to go from a three to four day
a week publication, become
financially independent from the

Woman wonders if she simply ’missed’ orgasm

Q: You have mentioned some-
thing-called a missed orgasm. I
have never quite understood that
term. I am that familiar 40-year-
old woman who has never had
an orgasm. Or, maybe I just
never noticed that I was having
one? How could that be?

A: Women's sexual responses
have been recorded in lab
research, where the missed or-
gasm was first observed. Their
breathing, pulse—rates and
changes in color in various areas
have been filmed. For instance,
a blush occurs above the breasts
during orgasm. There are contrac-
tions. All this can be recorded
and observed.

But some women have been
observed to have all the physical
changes associated with orgasm,
but are not aware of them in the
brain, or at least not able to
recognize them as pleasurable.
So we have records of women
who thought they never had or-
gasms but, in fact, were having
them and missing the pleasure of
the experience.

We very often talk of women

who do not ”permit” themselves
to reach orgasm. There are deep
doubts in the minds of many
women that prevent them from
enjoying the experience of sexu-
al pleasure. There are fears, well-
grounded, of becoming pregnant,
of becoming enslaved by their
partners or of losing control and
becoming unattractive or brutish.
There is a specific fear of passing
right out of consciousness —
something they have heard or
read may produce this fear,
though such loss of awareness, if
in fact it occurs, is only
momentary.

And there is the fear of not be-
ing able to have an orgasm,
which prevents the orgasm from
happening or prevents the wom-
an from recognizing it.

So we teach learning to have
orgasms and learning to recog-
nize them; we teach having fan-
tasies or streams of pleasurable,
positive thought which block out
worries and external concerns
like household or office work. Be-
fore going to a sex therapist, a
woman can read informative

books on the subject and try to
concentrate on the experience it-
self, keeping in mind that there is
always sex therapy to turn to.

Truthfully, after a certain age,
both men and women have more
moderate sexual responses, but
still enjoyable.

Q: My husband and I have sex
usually about twice a day and I
get sore in the genital area. Is this
normal?

A: Yes and yes. We sex ther-
apists don’t say ”normal,” but sex
therapy clients still use that word
frequently. At least twice a day,
a sex therapist has to say, ”We
don't use that word, but, yes, you
are normal.” So — it is normal for
a couple to have sex twice a day.

But, it is also normal for a cou-
ple to have sex more often or to
have sex once or twice a week or
less. I don't want anyone to read
in this column that some couple

has sex twice every day and that
I say that is normal. Someone will
get the idea that less than twice
a day is abnormal, or that more
than twice a day is monstrous.
Numbers don't come into this
very much; the mutual pleasure
and contentment of the coup|e’is
what we look at.

It is perfectly natural to get sore
in the femal genital area from sex-
ual activity, not so much from the
frequency of the activity, but be-
cause of the way it is done. If the
man does not do enough foreplay
to cause the woman to lubricate,
get nice and wet, this can cause
the kind of soreness you are talk-
ing about.

Some women do not lubricate
as freely as others, which may
call for using a suitable lubricant
such as K—Y Jelly (not an oil
product, which is bad for con-
doms and increases the danger of
infection for the woman). A
woman who has persistent sore-
ness after sexual activity, even
with generous foreplay, should
consult her gynecologist about it.

Q: What can a wife do if her

husband is hurting her by
penetrating too‘ deeply?

A: Just to be sure, have you
consulted your gynecologist
about this? If not, be sure to. This
is being on the safe side, making
sure that the problem is not a
medical one. When you have
been reassured on that point, try
other sexual positions to find one
that is better for your needs. The
female superior position, with the
woman on top, lets her control
the depth of penetration.

Sexually active people are
almost always counseled to put
more variety into their sexual ac-
tivities. Generally, this advice is
offered to put zest into the
proceedings, simply to avoid get-
ting into another regular routine,
when life is so full of routines. But
the different positions possible for
having sex are also important to
know, because there are purely
physical adjustments to make.
When the man is large in this
way, it is important to find a com-
fortable way to have sex, and it
is a good idea to know more than
one way to have it.

Tynen

university and do both without
the assistance of a media advisor.

He added though, ’’I do think
it needs better writing. I'd like to

work with people. I think the bas- .

ics of journalism are there, but I
think people need to loosen up
a little bit more and just need to
work on some other techniques.”
The Pitt News has created a
writer's apprenticeship for the fall
and Tynen feels that this will aug-
ment the quality of the paper.
”l think the main thing is the
paper in the past has been under-
staffed.  With more people,

we'll have time to work more on
stories, have more people out
there getting the news, and so the
people on the paper won't feel
like they're the only ones doing
it,” said Tynen.

Tynen said that one of his goals
for his tenure at Pitt is to make the
newspaper a bigger news
resource and in the long run
perhaps market The Pitt News as
a daily collegiate paper with the
scope of the Penn State and
University of Pennsylvania's stu-
dent newspapers.

Tynen makes his home in
Wilkinsburg with his wife and his

daughter. He did his undergradu-
ate work at Northwestern Univer-
sity and received his master's in
in journalism in 1976.

Along the way, he worked on
The Daily Northwestern, acted as
a reporter and editor for an ll-
linois paper called The Blue
Island—5un Standard and worked
on the Springfield, Ill. newspaper
The State /ournal Register.

From there he worked on a po-
litical campaign and lectured at
Eastern Illinois University. In ad-
dition, he taught classes at com-
munity college and worked on a
now—published reference book.

medical school in the United
States has attempted to bring
together the continuous, progres-
sive training in medical ethics
which culminates in practical
patient-centered ethical problem-

here at Pitt.”

Pitt's Center for Medical Ethics
was created in 1986, in response
to moral concerns in health care,
and encompasses the areas of
education, research and consul-
tation. lt employs a perspective
based on medicine, history, law
and the application of social
science involving practical med-
ical problems.

One of the Center's objectives
is to develop several Center-
sponsored task forces for research
projects of local and national in-
terest concerning ethical issues.

The Center is currently con-
ducting studies in doctor—patient

Americans should
apologize to Iran

After Sunday's mistake in the Persian Gulf, it seems only ap-
propriate to re—examine American policy in that area. Since the
reflagging of the Kuwaiti tankers, American forces have been
drawn steadily into increased conflict with Iran.

In a war, violence as vengeance becomes the accepted norm.

When an American naval vessel hit a mine supposedly plant- ‘

ed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members, Iranian oil plat-
forms in the gulf were bombed. When the administration
declared they had found ”irrefutable” evidence that the bomb-
ing of a West German discotheque was engineered by Libyan
sympathizers, Libyan military and civilian targets were bombed.
That evidence, it was later found, was most probably wrong.

From the Iranian point of view, the United States has joined
the war on the side of Iraq and has now killed more than 290
civilians in what the Americans are calling a ”terrible mistake."
That ”mistake” could well end up costing the Americans
another pointless war, should the Iranians take any action similar
‘to the revenge taken by the Americans.

Obviously, we can neither undo the mistake nor ignore an
act of |ranian_vengeance. It's a catch, Catch-22, the best there
is, to quote Joseph Heller. J

More and more, we are creating a position from which the
only escape is war. The American government should apolo-
gize, formally and in writing, to each of the killed passenger's
families. In addition, we should consider policy alternatives

designed to prevent escalation, rather than to save face.

It was an American mistake, which implies an American
responsibility to accept the castigation of the world and to make
every effort to prevent a repeat performance. Democracy and
human decency demand no less.

What's the tube comingto?

During one of my recent and
numerous bouts with insomnia,
I was flipping through the televi-
sion channels in search of some-
thing to kill time until sunrise. In
retrospect, I realize that it was
probably a mistake, but I had
seen each of the day's American
Movie Classics at least twice, and
I thought I could rely on cable
T.V. to bore me into golden slum-
bers. Instead I found myself more
restless and even a little irritated.

I was misled into believing that
I was watching a typical talk
show, which, by the way, is a
pretty safe bet when attempting
to doze off. I began to realize,
however, that something was
amiss because, first of all, the host
and hostess of this particular talk
show were related. They were
either brother and sister or hus—
band and wife, I don’t recall
which. But even ifthey had been
distant cousins the combination
wouldn't have spelled ethical
journalism to me.

MINDY

The whole picture became in-
creasingly fishy from that point
on. They were discussing weight
loss, which, under different cir-
cumstances, could be construed
as a legitimate conversational
topic in the '80s, I suppose. But
the discussion focused on_,.one
particular miracle product that
had helped each of the guests, as
well as a surprising portion of the
studio audience, to shed pounds
and pounds of unwanted fat.

The first guest was an ac-
tress/model, a career description
that I vehemently object to for in-
numerable reasons. (Bette Davis
or Brooke Shields, but please, not
both.) This woman began telling
tales of woe about her rejection
from a series of acting/modeling
jobs because of the unsightly cel-

lulite that once occupied her
thighs. That was, of course, be-
fore she discovered this wonder-
ous massage cream that the show
was pushing.

The next two guests echoed her
sob story and were equally satis-
fied with the product. Ooohs and
aahs came from audience mem-
bers who couldn't imagine that
these gorgeous ladies were ever
less than svelte. Very touching.

At the end of this Pulitzer Prize-
metiting pielce" ofjjougmalism, it
was announced that thelwhole
show had been a paid advertise-
ment — not a startling revelation
to this particular home viewer.

I later discovered that programs
of this sort are frequently run. It

strikes me as a lamentable, ,

almost vulgar practice. Write to
your congressman.

Hope for peace in the Persian gulf is receding

Now we did it. Two hundred
ninety Iranian martyrs. Two
hundred ninety unarmed and
quite dead Iranian martyrs. I be-
lieve their expression is shaheed.

Information surrounding the in-
cident is understandably sketchy
and vague, but our gunboat
diplomacy just lit a match
beneath the collective Iranian
consciousness.

Information released by the As-
sociated Press today mentioned
the type of radio transponder the
airbus was using, that it was the
same type as that used by Iran's
few F-14 jet fighters. Whoever or-
dered that airplane’s destruction
had that on his mind. Maybe he
knew someone on the USS Stark.
Maybe that person is dead be-
cause of human error.

Two hundred ninety martyrs.
That keeps going through my
mind. One martyr is bad enough,
now several hundred families are
mourning. And getting vengeful.

National Public Radio reported
that the Iranian ambassador to
West Germany said that Iran will
strike back, but not on American
soil. Why believe him?

Fortunately, the radical . Hez-
bul|ah’s mullah claims that pro-
Iranian factions holding Ameri-
can hostages in Lebanon will not
retaliate against the hostages. I'd
like to believe him. i

Some observers have noticed
that Iran's rhetoric over the air-
bus’ destruction has been careful-
ly toned down, at least for now,
so that Iran can gather some sup-
port from other nations.

This is all kind of the calm be-
fore the storm. Before dismissing
Iran as unable to cause damage
to America, recite this word to
yourself: terrorism.

Terrorism. Just the thought of it
produces a dread fear. What will
happen next? Skyjackings?
Hostages executed? Embassies at-
tacked, or maybe some simple
old-fashioned assassinations?

I don't know how many Irani-
ans are roaming the world with
vengeance in their hearts today,
but even those who are not allied
with a terrorist organization may
have murder in their eyes. Irani-
ans have some friends but not too
many. Just charming folks like the
Palestine Liberation Organiza-

tion, Daffy Qaddafi, and proba-
bly the Japanese Red Army, the
IRA and a dozen other terrorist
organizations who have a work-
ing relationship. None of them
have any great love of the Unit-

V ed States.

If I were an American service-
man overseas, I'd grow my hair
long, quit forming patterns, car-
ry a large pistol and dig a deep
hole. We have a lot of people in

other countries and protecting the '

majority of them is an impossibil-

ity. While VIPs can be shuttled
around in armored limousines
and receive quality professional
protection, it's the innocent
traveler or the military's depen-
dents who have the most to fear.

Given the state of the art explo-
sives and electronic detonators
that have made the suicide bom-
ber obsolete, some hard-to-detect
explosives can be left almost any-
where. While the free world's in-
telligence and anti-terrorist units
are probably working overtime to
keep ahead of the Iranians, too
much blood is about to be shed.
I really hope that I'm wrong this
time.

Two hundred ninety martyrs.

I've never been to Iran. Before
the Ayatollah threw the country
back into the Dark Ages of Islam,
despite the crimes of the Shah,
Iranians were known as warm,
friendly people who would go
out of their way to extend courte-
sies to travelers. Now, Iranians
and Americans are going to use
every negative stereotype availa-
ble as hatred is fanned.

The Satanic and bloodthirsty
Americans. The brainless goat-
smelling Iranians. And worse.

Much worse. The stereotypes will
send people of both countries to
the military recruiters. .

Get used to seeing propaganda
with Reagan and the Ayatollah
each wearing devil's ‘horns.
That's an old trick, but when
one’s rousing the rabble, even
simple sleight of hand tricks
suffice. Like throwing Molotov
cocktails.

I'm really hoping that I'm mis-
taken, but I believe the ferocity of
the Persians is as much reality as
it is legendary. Iranians have had
it in for us ever since they learned
who kept the Shah in power, The
ball is in the Iranians’ court; they
will move at a time of their own
choosing. Many people (humans
—— dig?) are going to get hurt.
Their bodies will be torn, they
will bleed. Children, infants,
women, elderly, the innocent
and also dedicated soldiers, who
many forget are also human. A lot
will die. They will become mar-
tyrs. American martyrs, too. I'm
afraid that we have another war
on our hands.

America the Beautiful

Eddie Murphy searches for a bride in ”Coming to America”

By T. VanderHeyden
For The Pitt News

In most, if not all of his films,
Eddie Murphy has played wise
guys who get away with every-
thing and make it look easy. This
time, it seems, Murphy has in real
life pulled one off, persuading a
major film company to pay him
to record his own personal fan-
tasy. The company is Paramount
Pictures; the product is Coming
to America. Amid elaborate set-
tings and nubile women, Murphy
and talk-show host Arsenio Hall
play several characters each in
this story of a potentate with pas-

sion on his mind.

Living in the fictional kingdom
of Zabunda, pampered Crown
Prince Akeem (Murphy) is a man
free of cares, whose only exer-
tions are polo, stick-fighting and
bathing with his female atten-
dants. Yet, he feels something is
missing. . When his arranged
bride-to-be turns out to have all
the willfulness and intellect of a
blow—up doll, Akeem and his
faithful companion Semmi (Hall)
leave the sunny climes of Zabun-
da to find in America a bride who
will love him for who he is, not
what he is.

Traveling to the place they be-
lieve is best suited for finding a
queen — Queens — the two at-
tend a Black Awareness Week
rally, where Akeem is entranced
by Lisa McDowell (Shari Head-
ley), a speaker at the rally. Soon
he and Semmi are working at
McDowell's, a Mickey D's rip—off
run by Lisa's father (John Amos).
As he enthusiastically mops the
floor and empties the trash,
Akeem seeks to win over his be-

loved, despite her boyfriend (Eriq
LaSalle), the arrogant son of a
hair-care product magnate. Fur-
ther complicating his efforts are
the undesired attentions of Lisa’s
precocious sister (Allison Dean),
and Semmi’s increasing irritation
at being deprived of Zabunda’s
palatial comforts. ,

As Akeem, Murphy is every
inch a prince, whether in crown
jewels or in a plaid McDowell's
uniform. Really making him be-
lievable is an impeccable accent
perfect for an African sovereign.
As Akeem’s lazy aide-de—camp,
Arsenio Hall doesn't get lines as
good as Murphy's, but he gapes
and goggles the way Murphy has
in past films. Murphy and Hall
also play barbershop loungers
and entertainers at the rally.
These novelty characters tire
quickly once you figure out who
plays each of them and really dis-
tract the viewer from the real ac-
tion. Shari Headley, the
sought-after Lisa, is a good-
natured girl-next-door but is
otherwise uninspiring. Darryl the
boyfriend is just a mess of curl ac-
tivator, and John Amos plays
much the same character as he
did in the pre-Cosby days of
Good Times. The bright spot in
the supporting cast is James Earl
Jones as the pompously solid
King of Zabunda, who is ”also a

concerned dad.” Perhaps he is in-

capable of a bad performance.
Perhaps he always sounds like
Darth Vader. Perhaps the camera
accords him the attention it ac-
cords Murphy. ‘

Coming to America has a huge
cast, sets of splendor and the best
wardrobe this side of Liberace.
Eddie and company fill the movie

Hunting Lodge
8-Ball
S/M Operations

’ The first thing you think of
is Big Black. Although it is
‘more than unfair to say that
Hunting Lodge is just another
band that uses drum machines
‘and guitars, neither Big Black
T nor Hunting Lodge is just
another band.

Hunting Lodge’s new al-
bum, 8—BaiI, melds the infa-
mous drum machine with
metallic guitars and impas-
sioned vocals. From the title
track to the last nightmarish
scream of ”Hourglass,” Hunt-
ing Lodge manages to produce
something interesting in a
genre that had seemingly been
tapped dry.

The album opens with the
grinding "8-Ball.” Richard
Skott's guitars, like aluminium
foil on your molars, make their
presence felt as well as heard.
His over-dubbed bass is cold
and hard and fills out the bot-
tom while Helmut Robinson's
drums thunder with mechani-
cal life. As if that were not
enough, Lon Diehl screams

pull an all-nighter all week
.long, it's four a.m. and I need
some more, gimme 8-Ball.”

The 8-Ball cues a hit

like a junkie from hell, ”|'l|_

You believe in Hunting Lodge.

Other great tracks on 8—Bal|
are ”Rip’N’Tear,"”Broken
Gardens”and the sparkling
”This is Truth.” ”This is Truth”
sounds as if it could even be-
come a dance club hit with its
driving bass and drum pro-
grams and the catchy chorus
of ”Hail to the Truth.” As with
many of the lyrics on this al-
bum, ”Truth” reveals Hunting
Lodge’s general nihilistic atti-
tude: ”You can't pretend your
life won't end, hail to the
truth.”

Not included on this album,
but equally great, is the 12"
single ”Tribal Warning Shot.”
A live and a studio version of
the song grace each side. Es-
sentially the same, the live ver-
sion is more fluid, and
Robinson performs an interest-
ing polyrhythmic drum pattern
throughout the Mau Mau
anthem.

Both the 12" and the album,
8—Ball, are worthwhile addi-
tions to any experimental col-
lection. If the live cut on the
12" is any indication of their
live performances, this July 23
at the Whitman school should
be great when Hunting Lodge
appears with XTSW and the
Hope Organization.

Siglo XX
Fear And Desire
Play it Again Sam

A little over eight years ago, Ian
Curtis ofJoy Division hung him-
self in his parents’ bathroom and
thereby ended a brilliant career
that was marred with tragedy and
genius. No one has forgotten
him, references continuously sur-
face in music and fiction.

Seemingly a whole school of
art has arisen from the Ian Curtis
mystique. People understandably
take him as their patron saint and
Joy Division's three albums,
Unknown Pleasures, Closer and
Still, as icons.

Within the last six or so years
there have been literally
hundreds of bands that have ho-
nored Curtis by emulatingjoy Di-
vision's moody sound and Curtis’
impassioned/detached vocal
style. The three recent releases by
the Swans, Siglo XX, and FOUR-

WAYCROSS each show direct or
indirect influence by Curtis.

The new 12" single by the
Swans contains two versions of
the Joy Division epic ”Love Will
Tear Us Apart.” It is rumored that
for certain members of the
Swans, i.e. Jarboe and M.G., the
recording of this song was close
to a revelation. M.G.’s version is
more true to the original than Jar-
boe, but hers is much more in-
teresting. She sings it in a different
key and is backed by acoustic
guitar and keyboard. This might
offend purists, but the intent was
honest. The other tvvotracks on
the single are quite good in their
own right. ”Trust Me” and ”Our
Love Lies” are both sungby MC.
in his best Nick Cave.

Siglo XX is truly frightening in
their homage to Ian Curtis. This
bunch of Belgians sounds so simi-
lar to Joy Division that one could
almost mistake ”My Sister Called
Silence” for an out-take from
Closer. The album, Fear and
Desire, is good in its own right,
but it does sound as if Ian Curtis
were still alive. Siglo XX uses the
same resonant effect on the lead
singer's voice. The singer even
uses the same phrasings and in-
tonations. The only real differ-

ence is that his voice is a little
lower in tone and more on key
than Curtis’.

The last of these albums is
FOURWAYCROSS’ self-titled
debut album. Thefact that it is

-released on Savage Republic’s

Nate Starkman & Son label says
that it's good but again, the Joy
Division influence is there.
FOURWAYCROSS sounds closer
to Joy Division musically than
either Siglo XX or the Swans. Ac-
tually, FOURWAYCROSS sounds
more like their own band than
even Siglo XX. Only ”MF” and
”Driving Thru Trees" sound like
the band in question. Other songs
like ”lntro” and ”Strictly
Morophine” strain more industri-
ally while ”Apologize” sounds
similar to Mask era Bauhaus.

Ian Curtis and Joy Division
were incredibly creative and
talented. When a band like the
Swans covers ”Love Will Tear Us
Apart,” it is obviously out of
respect. But is it really respect
when FOURWAYCROSS and
Siglo XX imitate Joy Division's
sound? Both bands sound good,
but both could be jumping the
train.

Little Feat ready for the beat

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

DiCesare-Engler Productions is
bringing Little Feat to Graffiti on
July 13.

A lot of people mumble some-

. thing like, ”Didn’t they break

up?” or ’’I thought they died in
a bus plunge."

Little Feat today is a sort of new
Little Feat, as original member
Lowell George met his maker.
The band today consists of origi-
nal members Richie Hayward
(drums), Kenny Gradney (bass),

Paul Barrere (guitar), Sam Clayton
(percussion) and Bill Payne (key-
boards), as well as new players
Craig Fuller (vocals) and Fred
Tackett (guitar).

The band reformed and is back
with their original label, Warner
Brothers Records. The original
members had quite a following
throughout the 19705, and many
people considered them the next-
best thing to the Grateful Dead.

Some of Little Feat’s landmark
albums include Sailing Shoes,
Dixie Chicken, Feats Don’t Fail

CLASSES ON CAMPUS

Me Now, The Last Record AI-
bum, Time Loves a Hero, Wait-
ing For Columbus and Down on
the Farm. Their album covers are
best described as hallucinatory.

Little Feat was one of a hand-
ful of groups which restored rock
credibility to Warner Brothers
Records. According to Warner
Brothers Records chairman Mo
Ostin, ‘'1 can think of no other
band better equipped to forge
new musical directions. It is a dis-
tinct pleasure to welcome them
back to the place where it all
started."

The trick’s on Knicks for drafting ’Stricks’ 

You're listening to American
Top Forty, originating from
Hollywood. l’m Casey Kasem,
and we're counting down the top
hits in the land all the way to
number one. We’re up to num-
ber eleven and the debut single
by an unpopular band out of

Pittsburgh called ”Tony and the '

Yes-Men,” with vocals by Pitts-
burgh Penguin front—office man
Tony Esposito. It’s a remake of
the lohn Taylor smash from the
movie 9‘/2 Weeks. Here's ”I Do
What I Do.”

©The ”let’s pick the home-

boy” philosophy that the New
York Knickerbockers have em-
ployed over the past two NBA

drafts seems to have gotten a bit
out of hand. With their first—round
pick last week, the Knicks took
DePau| guard — and native New
Yorker -— Rod Strickland. Okay,
they needed a point guard last
year at this time and proceeded
to select St. John's star Mark Jack-
son, another local, which proved
to be an act of true genius. But
this year, the Knicks didn't need
a guard. So,  l mean  what's
the deal with these guys? Where
is Strickland, a short 6—foot—3 and
I suppose a projected off-guard,
gonna play? On Pat Ewing's
shoulders?

0 The deal was rather quiet, but
the Buffalo Bills recently picked

up defensive lineman Art Still, a
troublemaker, but still a fine
physical football player, from the
Kansas City Chiefs. If Still cleans
up his act and performs the way
he is capable of performing, he'll
complement Buffalo star defen-
sive end Bruce Smith superbly,
and that defense could then sud-
denly be the best in the AFC. Call
it Lyle Alzado Syndrome.

WIMBLEDON, England -
They have long blond hair, shy
personalities, Olympic titles and
nearly identical first names. Now,
Steffi Graf and Stefan Edberg have
something else in common -
their first Wimbledon crowns.

Graf, however, can set herself
apart in September.

If the 19-year-old West German
wins the U.S. Open, she will be-
come the first player since Mar-

garet Court in 1970 to sweep the
four major tennis tournaments in
the same year.

’’I like her chances,” said Don
Budge, who won the first Grand
Slam in 1938. ”She’s sensation-
al. She plays like she wants to get
the match over with."

In the women's final, Graf end-
ed Martina Navratilova’s bid for
a seventh straight singles title and
ninth overall at Wimbledon. Af-
ter the match, Navratilova main-
tained her perspective, if not her
grammar. A

”Eight ain't so bad," she said.

Edberg’s victory means there
will be no Grand Slam this year
by a male player. His fellow
Swede, Mats Wilander, was half-
way to a Grand Slam after win-
ning the Australian and French
Open championships. But hewas

Sports Editor

Karen Masil: the name may not
ring a bell right now, but keep it
in mind — you'll be hearing a lot
about her in the future.

Masil, who will be a freshman
at Pitt in the fall, could perhaps
become the best breaststroker
ever to swim for the Panthers. As
a senior at Richard Montgomery
High School in Rockville, Md.,
Masil was an All-American and
has Olympic trials qualifying
times in the 100- and 200-yard
breaststroke.

”She’s talented, she's real
talented,” said Pitt women's head
swimming coach David Be-
lowich. And Belowich should
know. This year's recruiting class
is possibly the best in Belowich’s
eight-year stint at Pitt. It includes
two high school All—Americans
and possibly another Olympic tri-
als qualifier in Laura Lee Sullivan
from Rochester, N.Y.

But Masil is undoubtedly the
cornerstone of the class of 1993.
She finished 12th at senior na-
tionals in the 200—yard breast-
stroke and 22nd in the 100-yard
event

’’I’m about 10 seconds lower
than [Amy Shaw, the American
recordholder in the 200],” said
Masil, who has a personal best of
approximately 2:38.00.

”But looking at making the
[Olympic] team, I think it's im-
portant to be realistic. I know that
I train hard and I know that there
will only be 50 girls from the
country who make the trials,”
Masil said.

But she also realistically be-
lieves that she has a good chance
to become one of the two swim-

for a third Wimbledon title in four
years.

The win was sweet revenge for
Edberg, who had lost finals to
Becker at Queen's Club and Dal-
las this year. Edberg lost his final
service game at Queen's Club
when he double—fau|ted twice in
a row, prompting Becker to ques-
tion the Swede’s nerves.

’’I think it was the other way
around today," Edberg said Mon-
day after handing the West Ger-
man his first defeat on Centre
Court.

in another way, as the Atlanta Fal-
cons,.who play on a grass field at
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium,
will be moving into a turfed
dome in the early 1990s. Yet
another slap in the faces of NFL
traditionalists.

0 Within two years, the Pitts; \
burgh Steelers will have the best '

secondary in the NFL, very com-
parable to the one that the San
Francisco 49ers had in the early
1980s. .

mers to make the Olympic team.
’’I think I can make it back to the
final heat.”

”Anything can happen in the fi-
nals,” Belowich added.

The trials take place August
8-13 in Austin, Texas and only
eight girls will make that final
heat.

”Amy Shaw is maybe seven se-
conds ahead of the rest of the
team,” said Belowich, ”so the
race will be for second place.
That betters [Masil’s] chance.”

With Masil’s impressive
achievements, many people may
wonder why she opted for Pitt
rather than one of the perennial
west coast swimming powers.

’’I really liked the program, and
1 think getting along with the
coach is really important,” she
said. ’’I also really liked the cam-
pus and the big city,” said Masil,
who visited the campus only
once, last October, before sign-
ing with Belowich. Masil has
grandparents in Ambridge.

She expects Pitt to be a testing
ground for her swimming. ’’I’d
like to swim the intermediate and
distance freestyle. I'm going to try
to expand my events at college,”
Masil said.

’’I’m expecting a lot of new
things [at Pitt],” Masil said. ’’I
know I’d like to qualify for
NCAAs.”

Even though Masil will be just
a freshman, Belowich doesn’t
think that qualifying for NCAAs
is unlikely.

”She needs more leg strength
for her turns, but she has a fan-
tastic stroke,” Belowich said.
”She’s a little bit better long
course than short because of her
turns, but she converts well be-

Edberg went home following

and lives a short cab ride from the
All England Club.

During the tournament, Edberg
told reporters that he enjoyed liv-

knows that will change now, but
he doesn't think he will face the

PHILADELPHIA —- Philadel-
phia Phillies fans finally have ac-
cepted Lance Parrish, but Parrish
is not yet satisfied with himself.

Parrish had an off year in 1987
after leaving the Detroit Tigers
and signing with the Phillies as a
free agent. He rarely displayed
the talent that made him a six-
time all-star catcher in the Ameri-
can league.

The Philadelphia fans booed

him, and his wife and children
were the victims of unkind re-
marks in the supermarket.
Parrish, a lifetime .261 hitter
who averaged 25 home runs and
85 RBI through nine seasons at
Detroit, hit .245 with 17 homers
and 67 RBI for the Phillies. Even
his defense suffered with 15
passed balls, nine errors for a
catcher recognized as one of the
best in the game. The steal was
a favorite against him, though he
blamed Philly pitchers for not
keeping tabs on runners.
Parrish came to spring training
this year with dogged determina-
tion. He was the first player in the
locker room and usually the last
one out every day. In between,
he worked harder than anyone.
He is now the most productive
player offensively on a team that

bledon at age 17.

”I think you make your own
problems sometimes," said Ed-
berg, who won the men's com-
petition at the 1984 Summer
Olympics when tennis was a
demonstration sport. Graf won
the women's championship at
the same Games.

While the future looks bright
for Graf and Edberg, it is uncer-
tain for a trio of former Wim-
bledon champions from the
United States.

When John McEnroe, Jimmy
Connors and Chris Evert were
knocked out of the tournament,
it was unclear whether they
would ever come back.

McEnroe, 29, returned to Wim-
bledon for the first time since
1985 with high hopes. But the

three-time champion only made
it to the second round, where he
was beaten by Australian Wally
Masur.

McEnroe indicated he would
be back. But with a wife, two
children and a lot of interests be-
sides tennis, no one can be sure.

Connors and Evert were each
playing in their 17th Wimbledon.
Both hedged when asked if it
would be their last.

Connors, 35, staged another
one of his great Wimbledon
comebacks in the third round
against Derrick Rostagno. But he
ran out of magic in the next
round, losing a five-setter to
Patrick Kuhnen of West
Germany.

Evert, 33, made it to the semi-
finals for the 16th time before los-

ing to Navratilova in a tight ‘

three—setter.

yond NCAA standards.”

Masil's success has been some-
what unexpected. She said
Richard Montgomery High
School does not have ‘a
renowned swimming program,
"Not at all.” She became in-
volved with swimming "when I
was little. I actually didn't like the
water at all.”

But she started swimming again
when she was 9 and now com-
petes for the Rockville Mont-
gomery Sun Club under the
direction of coach Mark Eldridge.

Despite Masil's young age, she
may wind up competing with
one of the oldest teams ever.
”This year's Olympic team will
be one of the oldest in the histo-
ry of the games,” Belowich said.
This comes on the heels of
another "oldest Olympics ever”
in 1984, where 21, 22 and 23
year-olds competed.

By the time Masil hits 21, and
possibly the 1992 Olympics, she

may be regarded as one of the
best, not one of the oldest.

NOTES: 0 Sullivan is only six-
tenths of a second away from
qualifying for the Trials in the
100-yard breaststroke. "She’s hot.
She's just coming on,” Belowich
said. "There's a zone meet com-

. ing up in Buffalo, and that will be

one of her final chances to make
the cut,” he added.

0 Also included in next year's
recruiting class:

0 Noelle Barry from Charlotte,
N.C., a junior national finalist in
the butterfly.

0 Christine Gallagher from
Parkside, Pa., a high school All-
American and state finalist in the
50- and 100-yard freestyle.

0 Susan Baker from Baldwin,
Pa., a butterflier.

0 Carolina Day from Millford,
Conn., a distance freestyler.

0 Janine Atiyeh from Emmaus,
Pa., a state finalist in the 100-yard
backstroke.

is last in the NL and one of the
worst offensively in the majors.
The team is 15‘/2 games behind
the Mets.

Last year through July 5, Parrish
hit .224 with seven home runs
and 35 RBI. As of that date this
year, Parrish is at .228 with 12
homers and 47 RBI. He leads all
NL catchers in home runs, RBI,
game winning RBI and slugging.
He didn't get his 47th RBI or 12th
homer last year until the second
week of August.

"First of all, I wouldn't say that
those were numbers to really
brag about,” said Parrish.
"They're a little bit better than
they were last year, but I still
don't feel they are the kind of
numbers that I would like to see
at this point."

He said he is happy that he is
doing better than last year, but
"I'm disappointed with my bat-
ting average. I still feel I'm a bet-
ter hitter than what my average is
at this point.”

Parrish offers no excuses.

”I guess I am what I'm hitting
right now. Hopefully I'll be able
to put it up a few notches."

But even more disappointing,
the player said, is the team's last
place showing.

During his troubles last season,
it was no surprise when he said
he made a mistake leaving

Detroit. His problems with the
Tigers began when he missed the
final half of the 1986 season with
a lower back problem.

Then he wound up, after a
long, involved negotiation, sign-
ing with Philadelphia for
$800,000, less than the $1.2 mil-
lion offered by Detroit. The Phil-
lies paid him an additional
$200,000 after he played through
the first half of the season without
back trouble.

I Parrish is happy that the fans
appreciate his contribution this
season. He says the fan abuse of

-last year can be easily forgotten.

''I wouldn't let something like
that [the supermarket incident] af-
fect the way I play, or the way my
family looks at Philadelphia or
the game of baseball itself. It's
over and done with.”

Parrish's defense has also been
better this year. He isn't bragging
about six errors. But the errors
showed up on pressure throws
when runners got a jump on the
pitcher.

As to the fate of the Phillies,
Parrish said he is at a loss to
explain.

"I’m just as dumbfounded as
anybody else as to why we're
having such a_problem offensive-
ly. We have a very good offense
on paper, guys who have done it
in the past and are capable of do-

ing it again,” he said, rejecting
claims that the team lacks emo-
tion and leadership.

"We come here with a good at-
titude every day, keep working at
it. I have to question any judg-
ment on the attitude of this club,"
he said.

On his future: Parrish could be
a free agent again shortly, if the
arbitrator weighing baseball's col-
lusion case rules in favor of the
players against the club owners.

He wasn't too happy this year
when the Phillies refused to
negotiate a long term contract at
a substantial increase in salary.
He finally signed for one year at
the same $1 million he collected
in 1987.

"First of all, I have to see what
the decision will be,” Parrish
said.

"For example, in the '86 [col-
lusion] case, the arbitrator gave
the players [freed] 30 days to
make a decision. So, naturally if
I get 30 days to do one thing or
the other I can't afford to wait un-
til the season is over to decide
whether to stay here or go some-
where else.

''I'm sure they're [the club]
waiting for that [decision] too, so
they know what they have to
do."
