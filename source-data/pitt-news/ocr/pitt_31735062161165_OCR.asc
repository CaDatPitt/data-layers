Student reaction mixed

to U.S. attack on Iraq

By Renee Crespy

and Margaret Swisher
Slaﬂ’ Writers

Ten minutes after the United
States declared war on Baghdad,
students sat in the William Pitt
Union's Assembly Room with
their eyes ﬁxed on Cable News
Network’s report on the war.

Student reactions were mixed,
yet the majority of the students
felt the U.S. action was “scary, yet
necessary."

.“I feel it’s the United States’
responsibility as one of the
superpowers of the world  to
do this to keep it under check,"
said Pitt stu_,dent Raymond
Spelling. “I have friends there,
and I hadn’t thought about their
safety until I walked out of class
and heard. Then realization set in
that I might never see [them]
again.”

Becky Tedesco, whose brother
is in the Army reserves and could
get called for active duty, is scared

but supportive.

“I think it’s necessary, but like
everyone else, I’m scared. I
support my brother 100 percent,
but I don’t think Saddam [Hussein]
could be negotiated with. He’s
crazy," Tedesco said.

“I’m not scared,” said Bob
Tedesco, her brother. “It’s what
you do when you sign the papers
to be in the Army.”

Aida and Raida Khalil, two
sisters from Syria, are worried
about their families, who they
have not been able to contact.

“I’m stunned," said a teary-eyed
Raida. “I have aunts and uncles
over there that I haven't been
able to get in touch with. I’m
afraid that this might escalate into
World War III.”

“I think of the draft and all the
people that would go,” said Aida.
“I know it sounds strange, but
they just should have left things
alone.”

Pz'tt- experts comment
on situation in Gulf

By Mark Staf
Stajf Writer

Pitt Professor Theodore Windt, a noted political commentator,
described his reaction to the U.S.—led attack on Iraq with “great
sadness.”

Windt, who teaches in the communications and rhetoric
department, said comparisons to Vietnam do not apply to the
situation in the Persian Gulf. He said, “The interesting thing I’ve
found was this talk about ‘This is not going to be another
Vietnam.’ That’s very important in the sense of the basic
argument—standing up to aggression and stopping aggression.
But because of Vietnam and the inglorious end to that war,
those who oppose the war have been using the Vietnam
analogy that this is another Vietnam.

“I don’t think it’s similar in that Vietnam was a guerilla war
in which you were fighting small groups of guerillas, and you
didn’t know where they would attack. There was no air war in
Vietnam. We controllledl the air in that North Vietnam had no
air force; it [also] had no navy. There was never a major
confrontation of a large massing of troops on one side and a
large massing on the other, as we have right now on the border
of Kuwait,” he said.

Windt also said that he was not surprised about the moves
Saddam Hussein has made since his invasion of Kuwait.
However, Windt feels that war still could have been avoided.

War ﬁnally breaks out in the Persian Giff

Contributing Editor

And so it begins 

After five months of waiting,
tension and political games, war
has broken out in the Persian
Gulf. Under the pretext of
Operation Desert Storm,
American and allied planes
launched an attack yesterday
against Iraqi positions in both
Kuwait and Iraq at approximately
4:50 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.

At 6:37 p.m., the U.S. military
command in central Saudi Arabia
announced the attack against Iraq.
This was followed by an official
announcement from the White
House.

White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
that “the liberation of Kuwait has
begun.”

Allied forces then began an

5' attack on Iraqi positions. The first

wave consisted of 20 American

took off from a large air base in
central Saudi Arabia. As they left,
one reporter said that the jets
were “heavily laden with bombs,
missiles and cannon
ammunition.”

Sources in Baghdad said that
the jets came in “wave after wave”
of attacks. Reporters said that
they heard many explosions and
saw red tracers flying into the
sky. One report said that three
surface-to—air missiles were ﬁred
as well, but no planes appeared
to be hit.

In a speech to the nation,
President Bush said that ground
forces were not being used in the
initial attacks. He also said that
the United States was not alone
in this venture; along with U.S.
forces were British, Saudi and
Kuwaiti planes as well.

Bush said that Saddam Hussein
did not want a peaceful solution
to the crisis. “An Arab solution

peace, and he met it with open
contempt. We hoped that the
congressional resolutions would

Bush also discounted protests
that this conflict would turn into
another Vietnam. “This is not

The president said that the

he said. “We pray for their safety.

conquest of Iraq; it was for the

Protestors gather at Federal Building afte

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Members of the Pittsburgh
Committee for Comprehensive
Peace in the Middle East and
other concerned citizens
protested in front of the Federal
Building in downtown Pittsburgh
last evening.

After the announcement of the
air raid in Baghdad, Iraq, at about
7 p.m., people began to gather at

the Federal Building. The crowd
steadily grew to about 70 people
by9 p.m., when President George
Bush addressed the nation on
television.

“I’m just here because I know
it’s wrong. War solves nothing,”
Jill Flynn, a Pittsburgh resident,
said. “I’m so tired of hearing
about American interests. What
makes us so much better, and
what are the interests?”

A previously scheduled peace

vigil was held at the Federal
Building before the U.S. attack
on Iraq was announced. Prot-
esters were leaving the vigil when
they heard about the air attack.
“I know of people over there,
and my daughter has friends over
there. I’m protesting on every
level. It makes me sad. It makes
me angry. It is stupid. Nothing
about it makes any sense. It is so
tragic. What I like, though, is that
so many people are saying, ‘No,

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT I

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section
513 of Public Law 93-568, referred to as the "Privacy Rights of Parents and
Students," (more commonly called the ‘Buckley Amendment") requires that the
University of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and students of the following
information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students.
In order to do so, these provisions are binding on the University:

- Individual student records include only information necessary and relevant
to the educational purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or parents of students
imder 18 years of age upon request, with the exception that letters of
recommendation written prior to January 1, I975, remain confidential. Additionally,
specific documents that students have waived their right to inspect remain
confidential.

' - Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the institution
without student consent, unless one of several exceptions applies.

- Requests external to the institution for information regarding students
should be documented, as should releases of student information.

- The University may ‘establish categories of information known as "Directory
Information” and release this information upon request by individuals external
to the institution. This may be done only after students are provided the opportunity
to request exclusions from their information being released.

Directory information includes the following information:

Phone Number

Major Field of Study

Achievements, degrees, academic awards, or honors

refusal to permit the release of "Directory information", no further disclosures
are made without that student's written consent. (Except to parties who have
legal access to student records without written consent.) The refusal to permit
directory information is permanent. Rescinding of this action can be done by

Within an hour of learning that
the United States and its allies in
the Persian Gulf launched an air
strike on Saddam Hussein's
military bases, the Pittsburgh
Students Against the War
organized a meeting to discuss
taking immediate action.

Pitt student Mike Glabicki
described the meeting as “very
spirited” and felt that student
tensions were high.

“Everyone is ready to deal with
the issue at hand,” Glabicki said.

PSAW calls for rally in name of peace

starting at midnight last night.
The group will meet again at 1
p.m. today to go to a rally at 4
p.m. at the Federal Building, acc-
ording to Shawn Maclntyre.
PSAW issued a group statement
about U.S. actions in the gulf.
‘We, the Students Against the
War, are calling for all aspects of
academic life on all campuses to
be dedicated to open discussion
concerning the outbreak of war
in the Middle East. We are in
complete solidarity with the men
and women currently serving in
the military and extend our symp-
athy to all the victims of this war.
We maintain war could have
and should have been avoided.

We will continue to pursue any
and all means necessary to bring
about an end to this war. For
further information concerning
events, please call 661-4284.”

Academic counselor David
Hughes also attended the
meeting, and although he would
not comment for the entire faculty,
he did give his personal opinion.

"It’s just unnerving that
something so unnecessary has
just happened. The scary part is
that the people who would make
such a crazy decision to initiate
this conﬂict are going to be the
same people who will manage it,
and like‘in other wars, they won’t
be able to,” he said.

“I hope they throw more bombs. I support Bush very much
because this is what I feel we need to do. The bombs will bring
the boys home," Jim Wright, of O'Hara Township, said.

As a bus carrying military recruits stopped for a red light near
the Federal Building, protesters drew peace signs on the bus
windows.

“I feel very sad. Tomorrow we are going to see the pictures
from Baghdad of the horrible destruction that has happened.
Oil companies are not worth dying for,” Dennise Winnbrenner,
a member of the Committee for Comprehensive Peace in the
Middle East, said.

When Winnbrenner was asked how long she was going to
be protesting, she replied, “One day longer than Bush.”

Lydia Ramer, age seven, was at the rally when her family first
heard that war had started in Iraq. When asked what she was
doing there, she replied, “We want peace.”

University plans no change in policy, classes

Pitt President Wesley Posvar wasn’t in

began Operation Desert Storm, but a
university spokesperson said that Posvar
will not change his stance on the Persian

Gulf crisis.

“It would seem that he’s not going to say

stated the goal for the operation.
‘The goal for this operation is to
liberate Kuwait,” he said, “and to
enforce the U.N. resolutions.”

While Bush contrasted the gulf
crisis with Vietnam, Cheney
compared the U.S.-led attack with
the Panama invasion Of 1989.
“This is an ongoing operation,”
he said. “Panama was Over and
done with by this time."

Cheney stated why the attack
took place. “First Of all, the ’lU.N.-
imposed] deadline had expired,”
he said. “We consulted with Our
allies and took advice from our

senior military advisers.”
O O O

Damages from the first attack
seemed to be heavy. Many radar
installations in Iraq were knocked
out within the first few minutes of
the attack. Conflicting sources
said that either the F-153 Or
Tomahawk cruise missiles
launched from ships in the Persian
Gulf caused the damage.

Another target of this first wave
was the Elite Republican Guards,
Iraq’s best fighting units.

~ According to reports, these units

were “decimated” in this attack.
People within the U.S. gov-

ernment erroneously hoped that
the Iraqi troops would surrender
after the units were weakened.

Casualties appear to be
minimal, if not non—existent. All
American planes returned safely
from their first mission. The same
was true for the British, Saudi and
Kuwaiti planes taking part in the
offensive. Cheney called the
reports “encouraging.”

Iraqi response to the attack has
also been held in check.
According to Cheney, the
attackers encountered very little
air resistance. The only retaliation
reported was the launching of

five SCUD-B missiles by the Iraqis.
None of these missiles did any
damage, although one landed
close to Riyadh, the capital of
Saudi Arabia.

However, as Of 2 a.m., an attack
was underway, and ﬂames were
reported in Saudi Arabia.

After the original attack, Saddam
criticized the American action,
calling President Bush a
“hypocritical criminal.” He vowed
that the Iraqis would “crush the
satanic intentions of the White
House.

“The mother of all battles has
begun,” he said.

Experts

“I think that probably Saddam
would have built up -— especially

surrounding territories — that
he would have done as he has

brought to Iraq or whether they
had been exhausted. My Own
personal belief is that they had
not been exhausted.

“It’s underway, and there's
nothing to be done. One doesn’t
want to stand against soldiers
who are putting their lives On the
line out there, especially
Americans. I wish we would have
taken longer. I wish the sanctions
would have worked. I wish
Hussein would come to his senses

and get Out."

Pitt political science Professor
Jonathan Harris also commented.

Harris said liberation Of Kuwait,
and not defense of Oil reserves,
was the reason for the attack. He
said, “I think the president and
the people around him genuinely
feel that the main issue is the
liberation Of Kuwait, and that
you shOuldn’t allow any state to
invade another state. I think that
the leadership clearly feels that it
wants to punish this kind Of act-
ivity. Tthe Oil source has already

been defended by sendingall
those troops into Saudi Arabia.

“I’ve never thought that this is a
terribly good thing to do, but the
initial reports at least seem to give
the indication that they’re aiming
primarily at military targets, and I
just hope they keep the civilian
toll down. It’s a surgical strike,
and if they’re able to keep it that
surgical, it might be effective. My
main concern is what happens to
the people who are living in Iraq
other than [Saddam].

The calm after the Desert Storm

At precisely 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
(3 a.m. Iraqi time) onjan. 16, 1991, the first
bombs were dropped as the war against
Iraq officially began.

In an address to the nation, President
Bush stated that ‘the United States had now
“joined the war.” In what could possibly be
the most devastating war of the century,
Bush ironically quoted Master Sgt. J.P.

A EDITORIAL

Kendall of the 82nd Airborne as saying,
“We’re here for more than just the price of
a gallon of gas. What we’re doing is going
to chart the future of the world for the next
100 years.”

The Reagan and Bush administrations
have been hugely successful in military
actions taken against Grenada, Libya and
Panama. However, the war with Iraq has
vastly different connotations, with a much
greater risk to our nation and to the world.
We face a possible chemical war and the
loss of billions of gallons of oil from the
world market. There is also tremendous
fear of an increase in worldwide terrorism.
The fact that the United States plays such a
leading role in this situation increases this
potential danger.

Many people supporting Bush are citing
the Munich Conference of 1936. At this
time, the Allies allowed Hitler to keep
conquered territories in order to maintain
peace. Hitler used the Allies’ diplomacy as
a means to strengthen his forces and start
World War II.

While this is a strong argument, it must be
understood that the United States should
not presume the roleof world police. The
fact that the United States sent a force before
the United Nations passed a resolution to
use force in the Persian Gulf undermined
the authority of the United Nations.

Now it seems that Bush has given us only
two possible futures. If Operation Desert
Storm succeeds in driving Saddam Hussein
and Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, it will set a
precedent for the United States to use

military force in diplomatic situations. In
spite of a faltering economy, Bush will be
re-elected in 1992 by riding on the coattails
of this massive military victory.

If Operation Desert Storm fails, it will be
at the expense of many lives and a probable
devastation of the area, and it will pave the
way for enormous structural changes in the
Middle Eastern political arena. v_ Bush’s

chances of a second term in office would be
destroyed. The next president of the United
States will be elected on the promise that
our country will stay out of foreign diplomatic
and political disputes and will not deploy
U.S. troops to foreign soil.

In either scenario, the effects will be long
term, especially in foreign policy. In the
19305 U.S. foreign policy was so isolationist
that it prevented us from entering World
War II. After our successful role in this war,
our policy became so interventionist that in
the 19505 and ’60s we were involved in the
civil wars of Korea and Vietnam. In the
1980s, Panama and Grenada erased the
doubts the American public had about U.S.
foreign policy.

The situation in the gulf has the world
anxiously watching. The next move from
either side could have profound implications
that go far beyond the political realm. The
whole world is watching for news on their
sons and daughters, for burning oil fields
having potentially disastrous effects on the
environment and for the possible crash of
fragile economic situations worldwide.

We at the University of Pittsburgh have
seen have great division over the war here
on campus. Like the rest of the country, we
should be supportive of our troops, as they
are not the policy-makers. Rather, we hope
that they will return home soon.

We hope that Operation Desert Storm is
successful. Not because we approve the use
of military force in this situation, but because
the scenario if Desert Storm fails would be
horrific. We must maintain a state of level-
headedness. Even if Operation Desert Storm
is swift and the damage minimal, we will be
reminded of its debris for a long time to
come.

Children and tears of war

I still haven’t figured out what my feelings about the war are,
but I know that I’m feeling something.

This probably comes as a surprise to anyone who knows me.
I'm a pretty unemotional, middle-of-the-road guy when it
comes to just about everything that isn't sports-related. I’ve seen
the protests and talked to people on both sides but wasn’t really
affected either way.

Even after Operation Desert Storm began yesterday, people
in the newsroom jokingly referred to me as “a big ball of apathy”
and “a human koosh ball.” Our production manager, Tim
Weber, said to me, “Wait a minute. I thought you'd be in favor
, ofthe Qilers;T’_ My ﬁrst thought
:_,,wh_en; Llielaidkzjhat Baghdad
. =h%<*be¢n’b<5tﬁb€§  “WW3
I Jé‘ff"" Tatudkd“ predicted

perfectly when we would

attack.”
But there have been a few
events over the past few days
that r__nade‘me storrjandltltink; On Tuesday I was on my way to
the chemistry building about the same time as the pro-peace
protestors were coming down Fifth Avenue and heading
toward Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It was an impressive
sight to see the street filled with people like that. l J

I happened to run into black studies department Chairperson
Dennis Brutus, one of the more vocal leaders on campus, as he
was crossing the street. I stopped him and commented about
all of the people heading to Soldiers and Sailors.

“I will follow them wherever they go,” he said. He then told
me about people getting arrested in front of the White House
and the U.N. building. I can’t describe the emotion I felt coming
from him as we talked brieﬂy, but somehow that short
conversation got through to me in some way. I know that I've
never met a person who believes as deeply in what he or she
is doing as he does. It made me wonder what it would be like
to feel that strongly about something, but I kept on going.

It was then that two buses full of elementary-school kids
pulled up at the red light on Bigelow Boulevard. The kids on
the buses rolled down their windows and all began to chant,
“No war, no war.”

There's never been anything that affected me the way those
young children did. Many of the protesters took a detour from
the march to walk by the buses of chanting kids. I still kept
going on my way to the chemistry building, but I had to wait
in the lobby a few minutes to get rid of the tears in my eyes.

I don't know what that means or how I feel right now. I do
think that no one really wanted this to happen, and it is
important for people on both sides to realize that the choices
made by President Bush, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and all those associated with Operation Desert Shieldl
Storm are not easy ones.

J‘.-‘ rm. .

Tezak

Decisions are just not as black and white as the map on the
cover of today's issue. Everyone should take a moment to step
back and see things from the perspective of the other side. Even
after the start of what Saddam has called “the mother of all
battles,’ all I know is that I'm still fighting back some tears when
I think of those children on the buses as I write this.

Jason Hillrnan/The Pitt News

Freshman Jonna Huemrich had 12 points and 7 rebounds against the Bucemes last night.

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_ﬁ" Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team continued its strong play
against Big East competition by
defeating Seton Hall 01-5, 1-4 in
the Big East) 70-58, raising its
conference record to 4-1 and
overall mark to 9-7.

“We played against a much
bigger team,” said a pleased Pitt
Coach Kirk Bruce. “Inside we
start Jonna Huemrich and Lorri
Johnson, Jonna being the bigger
player at 6 feet. And they start
two players who go 6-3.

‘We were real hungry. We
played very, very hard tonight.
This team believes it can win the
Big East.

“We’re 4-1. They really believe
they can come to the other team’s
gym and win. We ‘ve played
three games on the road and won
two of them. That’s very good.”

Seton Hall was one of the teams
picked to finish ahead of Pitt in
the Big East this season. The
Bucettes finished third in the Big
East last year and returned all five
starters.

. The Lady Panthers had five
players in double figures, led by
senior forward Johnson ‘s 22
points and six rebounds.

Among the starters, freshman
center Huemrich scored 12 points
and pulled down seven rebounds.
Pitt’s sophomore guards, 5-4
Maureen McConnell and 5-8 Lisa
Fessler, each scored 11.

“Jenine Joyce la 5-9 freshman
who plays guard and forward}
came off the bench and played a
great game,” said Bruce. “She
had 12 points and eight
rebounds.” Joyce’s eight boards
led the team.

“I thought we played good
defense tonight. We were really
scrappy,” said Bruce.

“We shut them down. We shut
their leading scorer down. Kris
Durham is their leading scorer,
and we held her to eight points.
I think that might be a season low
for her. “

Free-throw shooting, which has
been up and down all season,
was a problem last night.

“It was bad tonight, ” said Bmoe.
“If we had shot what we think is
normal for us —— around 70

percent —— we would have won
by 20 points. We missed a lot of
free throws. We talked about that
tonight. We even talked about it
as a team. I'm not sure why that
happens. Sometimes we practice
that a lot, and in the games we
don’t make them. Other times,
when we don’t practice them so
much, we shoot them great. I
don’t know. It’s a concentration
thing.”

“We’re playing more as a team
now,” Bruce said when asked to
compare the team now to when
it struggled earlier this season.

“We’re getting some good play
off the bench. We are still very
young. The lineup we started
tonight had one senior, one junior,
one freshman and two
sophomores. We are just coming
together now and getting to know
where the other players are going
to be.‘

Pitt continues its road trip with
a visit to Boston College Saturday.
“They are a very tough team,”
said Bmce. ‘We've got to go
there and beat them. They won't
beat themselves. They play tough
man-to-man defense."

Men's gymnastics
‘three times better’

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

The men's gymnastics team
opens its season this Saturday
at William and Mary College in
Williamsburg, Va., and
although Coach Frank
D’Amico is expecting big things
from the team this year, he
said it may be fighting hard for
points this weekend.

“We’ve got a very strong
team this year, as good as I’ve
ever seen. But I don’t know if
they can put it together this
soon," D’Amico said.

A victory at the Naval
Academy’s Metro Invitational
in November gave the Panthers
confidence. But D’Amico said
the team is working on more
difficult routines now, which
aren’t polished at this point.

Pitt beat William and Mary
at the Metro Invitational by
just 2.1 points, hardly a wide
enough margin to give the
Panthers much breathing room
in Saturday's meet.

D’Amico said the meet may
be decided after the floor
exercise, the first event. Floor
is William and Mary’s best
event and one in which Pitt is
struggling now because of
injuries.

Jorge Gonzalez (Achilles’
tendon), Genaro Severino
(knee) and Brock Freehling
(ankle), three of Pitt’s top

competitors on floor, are all
suffering from injuries which
prevent them from performing
their most difficult routines.

“Conceivably, we can be
down by two points after the
first event,” D’Amico said. If
that’s the case, Pitt will be
playing catch-up for the
remainder of the meet and
will need to hit every routine
in more difficult events like
pommel horse.

D’Amico added, however,
“If we’re winning after floor, I
think we’ll pull away from
them.”

“Because ﬂoor is [William
and Mary’s] best event, I’m
expecting a close meet,”
D’Amico said. “I would like to
know that we can go in there
and win by 10 points, but I
can’t say that. Their team is
very good this year. It’s not
like they’re going to give
anything away. If it isn’t a
close meet, I’ll be surprised.”

Last year, Pitt finished at 10-
7, and made dramatic
improvements from the

beginning of the season to the
end. D’Amico even remarked
it was the best team he’d ever
had. His outlook this year is
even more positive.

“We’re three times better
than we were last year," he
said.

Wrestlers come up big
in tri-meet road win

By Christopher Block
Staj)" Writer

The Panther wrestling squad began its two-match road trip
last night with dual-meet victories against Ashland and Mount
Union at Ashland.

In winning their first two matches of the season, the Panthers
thrashed the Ashland Baglés 336, and rocked the Mount Union
Raiders 41-9.

At the 1 18-pound weight class, Panther Mike Moore rebounded
from a defeat against Lehigh to claim two pins against Ashland
and Mom“ Uhl0h- Al 134. iUniOr Joe Bursick added two
ViC[0Fi€S. including 3 big win against Ashland’s Herb Pinkney
who is considered by many to be a high-quality wrestler. ’

Another wrestler who was able to rebound from the earlier
match against the I.ehigh Engineers was sophomore Steve
Budman, who gained a victory at the 142 weight class.

Panther Dave Kelly ran into some problems in his matches
coming up empty in both attempts. However, after the match,
Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer was pleased with Kelly’s
efforts: “Dave had a real tough match [against Ashland], and he
put up a real [gutsy] performance."

Junior Scott Hovan continued his winning ways, as he picked
up two more victories in last night’s action. In winning the two
m3[Ch€S. 006 bY 8 pin and the other by a technical fall Hovan
raised his record to 15-1, which leads the Panthers in victories

An interesting twist to the tri-meet was the movement of
sophomore Sean Gibbs. Gibbs, who normally wrestles at me

have returned from that team,
and D’Amico is pleased with the
marked improvements they’ve
made, particularly Freehling and

junior Dave Bausmith.

“Both have made incredible
improvements since last year, all
around,” he said. “They’ve gotten
stronger, and they’ve increased
their level [of performancel.”

D’Amico has also gained three
new talents in Gonzalez, Severino
and freshman Brian Yourish.

Gonzalez isn’t really a new
face to Pitt gymnastics, returning
after taking last year off. In

previous years he qualiﬁed twice
for the national championships
on pommel horse.

Severino, originally from Porto
Alegre, Brazil, is a sophomore
transfer student from Northern
Illinois University.

The combination of old and
new talent means increased depth
for the Panthers and hopefully,
some very high scores.

No matter how the team fares
Saturday, D’Arnico knows he’s
got a great team in the making.
He expects to see major
improvements as the season
progresses.

and 177 for the second. He was

victorious in both matches.
One of the best surprises of the
season, freshman Jeff Kloiber,
maintained his string of fine
performances by winning both

of his matches. Coach Stottlemyer
was obviously pleased with the
talented freshman. “[Kloiberl has
wrestled really good this season.
I’m really pleased with him,"
Stottlemyer said.

Finally, heavyweight Perry
Miller provided some excitement
in the form of two victories. Miller,

who won against Lehigh, is

draw against the fourth-ranked
Arizona Sun Devils.

“We really needed a strong
performance and we got it.
Hopefully itwill be a confidence-

Penguins struggle on road as all—star controversy brews

Well, forget about the rumors
that have been circulating around
town about the Pittsburgh
Penguins being road warriors, at
least for the meantime. Tuesday
night at the Spectrum the
Philadelphia Flyers put an early
wallop on the Pens, only to
escape with a 5-4 victory. The
win thrust the Flyers back into
second place in the Patrick
Division, a point ahead of the

Pens. The loss dropped the
Penguinsto 24-21-3, a 12-9 mark
within the Patrick.

Philly was thinking KO early,
as they struck for four first-period
goals against goaltender Tom
Barrasso. Barrasso was not totally
to blame for the Flyer lead, as he
turned away numerous
breakaway attempts while the
defense crumbled around him.
Paul Coffey registered a 3—rating

Brian
Berger

for the first period and was beaten
badly on the last two goals of the
period, both by all—star winger
Rick T occhet.

The Penguins have now lost
three straight on the road,
including two defeats in Canada

at the hands of Toronto and
Montreal. The Penguins have
played poorly in all three games.
particularly on defense. They have
allowed 17 goals, almost all before
the third period, forcing them to
attempt-to come back from huge
deﬁcits on the road. Overall this
season the Pens have been a
good road team (9— 10-2), but they
have struggled recently.

M-30 WILLIAM PITT UNION

NHL will hold its annual all-star
game, and now that national
television (actually the second
year in a row) is carrying the
game, it is important to create
some controversy.

Wales Conference Coach Mike
Milbury of Boston, who said that
statistics wouldn't mean a thing
in his selections, lived up to his
comments by assigning tough-
guy Chris Nilan and defenseman
Garry Galley, both of Boston.

What a joke. Nilan is a goon
who does nothing but intimidate,
and while his value may be
respected around the league, he
is no more worthy as an all-star
than a bruiser. The all—star game

is for the fans and for players’ I

egos, not for five goal-scorers
and fighters.

Conspicuously omitted from the
Wales was New York Rangers
center Bernie Nicholls. Also,

Boston center Craig Janney, one ‘

of the premier two-way centers
in the league, would have been a

’ much sounder choice than Nilan.

Others that should have made
the team: Zarley Zalapski, Pelle
Eklund of the surprising Flyers
and Kirk Muller of the Devils.

Over in the Campbell
Conference, John Muckler of
Edmonton also made some
interesting calls. How about Bill
Ranford (Edmonton) as the
backup to Mike Vernon? Lunacy.
Ed Belfour (the rookie) is the
reason the Chicago Blackhawks
own the best record in the NHL.
Belfour is 28-11-2 with a 2.41
goals-against average.

Others who were left out: Steve
Duschene of Los Angeles andjoe
Niewnyduk of Calgary. What
Muckler was thinking in leaving
these two off the squad is
unfathomable. But of course, he
wanted another Oiler on the team,
so he chose Mark Messier,
arguably the best mortal in the
NHL. But he’s only played in 28
games and has four goals; Nilan
has two more this season.

Great players are always left
off all-star teams, but insider-
trading charges should be brought
up against both coaches who
loaded the team up with players
from their own squad. The Pens
take on Toronto at Maple Leaf
Gardens tonight in their last game
before the break.

’lI’IEIIE Prrr NEWS

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Manny Theiner
For the Pitt News

Does Pittsburgh really have a music
scene? The city’s got plenty of dime—a—
dozen Top 40, thrash—metal, rhythm and
blues, “progressive” (i.e. New Wave circa
1983), re ggae and hi ppie/ folk poontangers.
But if you’re talking about the late—’80s
post-punk underground independent rock
scene, you can almost forget it. Two bands
have attracted a lot of attention outside of
Pittsburgh in places where people know
what's up — Sludgehammer and the
Northern Bushmen.

These groups are caught in limbo
between two long-established camps at
the Oakland club. They are ignored by the
jangly, alternative poser crowd, yet they
aren’t accepted by the hardcore scene
either. “We have ‘moshable’ parts in our
songs,” says Sludgehammer bassist Brian
Welcker. “They just start and stop too
much for the punks to figure out.”

That remark may at first seem strange,
considering that their first show was in
drummer Ian Williams’ living room, back
when he lived with members of the
hardcore band Necracedia. From then on,
Sludgehammer developed a self-described
“college— geek” sound, drawing on various
indie—rock inﬂuences that easily suggested
their suitability in supporting acts like H.P.
Zinker and Bitch Magnet at The Upstage.

The Northern Bushmen had a different
genesis, since they were all high—school
students (three are still 16 years old) when
the band was formed last year. “Pat [Morris]
used to jam with me in my basement,”
recalls drummer Noah Leger, “and I met
Chris [Kleinerl while going to school at
CAPA. I don’t know where we got Mike
lRhoadsl."

They derived inspiration from hanging

SHOWCASE

out with Damon Che, former drummer for
Half Life and the Heretics, who turned
them on to bands taking the next logical
step into that heavy—ass noise-rock thing,
such as Scratch Acid and Laughing Hyenas.

At their first few gigs, the Bushmen were
followed around by high—school girls and
a large all-ages following (220 saw them
open for Knifedance last Martin Luther
King Jr. Day), but that stopped shortly.
“They looked at Mike and realized that he
screams," says Leger.

And indeed he does, staggering about
on stage and ranting with the fury of David
Yow (Jesus Lizard) and john Brannon

hmen Sm? into

(Hyenas) combined. “I hate when people
ask why we're doing this angry white—boy
thing. We’re gonna do what we’re gonna
do.” Leger doesn’t have any problem
making his own comparisons, however. “I

wouldn’t mind being equated with bands
on Touch & Go and Amphetamine Reptile
[two respected indie-rock labelsl.”

But the ftrststep is to release a collectable
7-inch on—your—own label. Brian Welcker
obliged with his Cubist Productions. After
finishing a couple of small players by The
Crow Flies and an LP by Special Ed, he
turned his attention inward to record a 7-
inch EP by his own band and another by

the hcaVY“‘55’ “°

the new Bushmen on the block.

The two records sold out their first
pressing in two months, almost entirely
outside the Pittsburgh area. They received
airplay on the better college radio stations

across the country (“Top 10 in Pomona")
and raves in fanzines. “We got 30 or 40
letters from the review in Maximum Rock
‘n’ Roll alone,” Welcker says.

The Northern Bushmen snagged the
first label offer from New York’s Circuit
Records after they opened for a Melvins/
Surgery bill at The Upstage. The deal
includes a 1500-copy pressing of the 7-
inch single (100 on colored vinyl, natch)
of “Shelly’s Trip/Pulsing Sex Ember,” to
come out next month with an optional six-
song EP to follow.

In the meantime, the Bushmen are
keeping themselves busy fitting in an all-
ages show last week in Morgantown and
preparing for another gig with Surgery on
Jan. 26 at New York’s famous CBGB club.

The boys in Sludgehammer are mainly
concerned with “churning out more scene
artifacts,” according to guitarist Karl
Hendricks. Ile’s working on another issue
of his fan‘/.ine, Balloon Ride, which
previously contained short stories and
interviews with Unsane and local folk-
rockers Wimp Factor Fourteen. The new
Rear Window, Brian Welcker’s counterpart
publication, has been dubbed the “Special
Hate Issue,” and he’s still planning on
letting the long—awaited Pleasure Heads
CD see the light of day.

Creepy. That’s the one word

that most accurately sums up

Daniel Clowes’ Eightball comic-

book series. These graphic novels,

as some call them, are published
on the independent Fantagraphics
label. In case any D.C. and Marvel
fans are wondering, ‘independent
label’ means no superheroes in
tights making cliched wisecracks
as they battle formulaic threats
by forces of evil. No, on
independent labels, the artists
invite you to join them in looking
at the world from a point just
below the surface of reality. The
result is stories with a
psychological edge. And Clowes
is a master at creating stories that,
just like good horror movies,
make you laugh right before
scaring the wits out of you.

Eightball is the second comic-
book series from Clowes. The
first, Lloyd Llewellyn, was named
after the title character, whom
Clowes describes as a sort of “ an
Everyman character, a typical
American, addicted to all of these
things and kind of controlled by
his surroundings.”

Along with his sidekick, a
beatnik, Llewellyn finds himself
in all kinds of improbable
situations in his quest for
happiness —— even if it means
traveling to Venus to meet the
woman of his dreams and finding
out bitterly that when fantasy
meets reality, something has got
to give. In Lloyd Llewellyn, Clowes
utilized a clean, jazzy style

reminiscent of the fifties.

Lloyd Llewellyn story yet to
appear in Eightball is “I Hate You
Deeply,” an angry rampage filled
with biting humor that features
every self-styled stereotype
around.

Another story worth noting -—
probably the most bizarre yet —
is “ Like a Velvet Glove Cast in
Iron”. This dreamlike series
features a man searching for the

nus prrr NEWS, Thursday, January 17, 1990

By Jessica Coville

Assistant Managing Editor

For a couple of women that
occupy the time slot usually
dedicated to morose music, WPT S
“Goth” queens Erica Murray and
Alisin Hollihan love to laugh.
They maintain that they don’t
like to play Bauhaus, and their
favorite color isn’t black. In fact,
these women find refuge in ’70s
guitar god Ted Nugent.

“When my hair gets big [from
the rain], I look like Ted Nugent,”
said Hollihan.

“She’s got the kind of hair that
people pay a lot of money for,”
said Murray, who used to listen to
Ted Nugent and Black Sabbath in

‘high school. “Ted Nu gent touches

all of us.”

“I did not say that,” said Hollihan
into the tape recorder, trying to
clarify what Nugent means to
her.

“You said Ted Nugent is the
evolution ” said Murray,

giggling.

Though they are on the “Goth”
time slot for \X*'PTS, they both feel
that particular descriptive is
misleading because most people
associate “Goth” solely with the
gloom kings —— Bauhaus.

Bauhaus, an English group now
defunct, was known in the
mainstream for the song “Bela
Lugosi is Dead,” featured in the
flick The Hunger.

Gothic music is usually
associated with droning musical
riffs and “suicidal” lyrics, but the
term can seem to be too easily
categorized. Where Hollihan
doesn’t really like to classify things
with a particular name, Murray
feels the term “psychedelic snack”
best fits her show, Murray and
Hollihan alternate the 1 to 3 p.m.
time slot of Sunday afternoons.

Both Murray and Hollihan grew
up in western Pennsylvania. “I’m
from Zelienople. I had a real
exciting youth  I sat in my room
pretty much,” said Hollihan.

Erica Murray and Alisin Hollihan: not as depressed as they look

Murray is from Monroeville and
maintains vehemently that she is
not a mall chick. I

“I got grounded once because
I ran away from home to see
Wolfgang Press. I called my mom

back covers of Eigbtball. Each one
features a question like, “What

of about 12 panels, each featuring
an older person answering the

chilling in its accuracy, is “Young
Dan Pussey”. This story chronicles
the lives of young comic—book
artists, centering on Dan Pussey.
They are held captive by a
demented publisher who forces
them to live, eat and work together
in order to achieve art in the
comic—book industry.

This story makes a bitter
statement on greed in the arts
and those who exploit young
talents to achieve these goals.
This story, it turns out, is even
frightening to the creator, who
says he learned after the story
was published that a label
practiced this type of abuse of its
artists. Disturbing as this is, it’s

this kind of reality in Clowes’ art
that works for the reader.
Though the stories seem

improbable, Clowes’ honesty in
working with the sometimes
awful, ugly human drives is what
ultimately strikes a chord with his
readers. Clowes is one talented
artist with the kind of integrity
that is rare. His Eigbtball series
deserves attention, and if you
want to know more you can meet
Clowes in person at the Pulse

James Anthony Shanta as Charlie Fox and David Butler as Bobby
Gould in Mel Shapiro's Speed-tbe-Plow.

By Michelle Kleinsak

For the Pitt News

“Life in the movie business is
like the  beginning of a new
love affair: it’s full of surprises,
and you’re constantly getting
fucked.”

Welcome to David Mamet’s
Hollywood.

Mamet’s Speed-the-Plow,
currently being staged at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater under
the direction of Mel Shapiro,
attacks the evils of Hollywood,
particularly the film industry, in a
way similar to Nathaniel West’s
Day of the Locust.

Speed—tbe-Plow focuses on
Bobby Gould (David Butler), who
has just been promoted to head
of productions at a big-name
studio. Charlie Fox Games
Anthony Shanta), a struggling

producer who’s been loyal to
Gould for 11 years, finds a script
with get— rich potential and even
secures a “star” for the major role.

Everything appears to be going
smoothly until Karen (Ming-Na
Wen), a temporary secretary,
shows up. Fox bets Gould 5500
that he will never get Karen in
bed.

Gould gets Karen and the
money, under the stipulation that
he makes a meaningful film out
of an Eastern philosophy book
about the end of the world.

Although the characters seem
unethical, each of them possesses
some strange virtue that appears
odd in this “sinkhole of slime and
depravity.” Fox’s loyalty to Gould
seems out of place, and Karen’s
conviction to make the

 Mamet's Speed-the-Plow a frightening look at Hollywood

forces behind the men in Speed-
tbe-Plow, and the only woman in
the play is portrayed as an
innocently Cunning, opportunistic
parasite.

As Bobby, the man on top who
is constantly being pulled at from
all sides, Butler mesmerizes the
audience with quick, psychotic
energy. He hypnotizes with
brazen behaviorisms and lewd
analogies. Shanta brings excellent
comic timing to his lines as Fox,
the struggling producer. Wen
portrays the manipulative Karen
with a doe—eyed innocence that
makes her even more credible.

Although somewhat sparse, the
set works well and conveys a
typically Californian atmosphere
with the use of neon and a life-
size fish tank. This atmosphere
complements the witty,
downright frightening look at
Hollywood that Speed-tbe—Plow
provides for about 110 minutes.

WHAT IF YOU DON'T OH
INTO THE GRAD SCHOOL’
OF YOUR CHOICE?

Sure, there are other schools. But why
settle? Kaplan helps students raise their
scores and their chances of being admit-
ted into their first-choice schools. Fact is,
no one has helped students score higher!
