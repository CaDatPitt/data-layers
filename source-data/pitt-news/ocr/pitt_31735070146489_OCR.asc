Investigation ends

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Sodexo agreed to post ﬂyers listing
its employees’ rights to organize
and participate in union activities
as part of an agreement with local
union workers that ended a federal
investigation into Sodexo’s practices
on campus.

The agreement says that the
multi-national food corporation

. “does not admit to a violation of

the National Labor Relations Act,”
according to documents obtained
by The Pitt News Wednesday. The
National Labor Relations Boardwas
investigating a local union’s claims
that Sodexo intimidated and threat-
ened its nonunionized workers at
Pitt.

About 150 of Sodexo’s employ-
ees have no union representation,
and about 200 belong to the Service
Employees International Union Lo-
cal 32B], which brought forth the
charges in March. V

Kim Siegert, acting regional
director of the National Labor Re-
lations Board, said that it is not

. unusual for the “charged party” ——

Sodexo, in this case —— to ask for
that type of clause in a settlement
agreement.

Most of the terms of the settle-
ment include parts of section seven

Officer declines board spot

Former detective turns down mayor’s appointment to board

John Manganero
Assistant News Editor

One of Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s
appointees to the Citizens Police Review
Board has decided not to serve on the law
enforcement oversight board.

Former city police Detective ‘Diana
O’Brien Martini notiﬁed the mayor of her
decision in a letter last week, in which she

a said she is unable to serve at this time but

would like to serve in the future, according
to the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

The Citizen Police Review Board has
clashed with city officials over whether to
release documents from last September’s
G-20 Summit, parts of which the board
hopes to investigate. ,

Martini was among ﬁve new board mem-
bers nominated this August by Ravenstahl
and was scheduled to be sworn in on Friday.
She did not give speciﬁc reasons for her deci-
sion in the letter.

The other nominees include two current
board members, Richard Carrington and Pitt
Student Conduct Ofﬁcer Deborah Walker, as
well as new appointeesDonna Kramer, the
Rev. Eugene DowningJr., Deborah Whitﬁeld
and Leshonda Roberts. * -

Martini’s decisioncomes after months of
disagreement over Ravenstahl’s decision to
replace board members amid ongoing G—2o
Summit police document controversy. The
conﬂict formally began on June 18, when
the CPRB and city attorneys disagreed over
investigations of police conduct during the
G-20 Summit.

, The CPRB argued that a general inves-
tigation of the summit did not exceed its

, powers, while city attorneys countered that

the board could only investigate individual
complaints of police misconduct.

At the high point of the related media
attention, Ravenstahl announced that he
intended to replace ﬁve of the seven board
members and reappoint two.

Now the mayor will have 30 days to nomi-
nate Martini’s replacement, the Post-Gazette
reported, and it is likely that City Council
will interview the candidate before voting
on the appointment.

V The board’s bylaws dictate that at least
two former law enforcement professionals
must sit on the board at any one time, so
Martini’s replacement must have direct law
enforcement experience.

Neither Martini nor the mayor’s ofﬁce
could be reached immediately for com-
ment. I A

Settlement ends
federal inquiry

Settlement 4 1

of the National Labor Relations Act. The sec-
tion includes terms that affirm workers’ rights

' to join, aid or associate with aunion. The other

portions come from the court interpretations
of workers’ rights since Congress passed the
law, Siegert said.

Settlements like the one between Sodexo

After the parties ﬁnalized the settlement on
Aug. 31, King said that the company believed
it had acted lawfully. p

“Sodexo has a zero-tolerance policy con-
cerning discrimination, harassment or retalia-
tion of any kind, including actions against any
employee for engaging in union organizing

About 150 of Sodexo’s employees have no union
representation, and about 200 belong to the Ser-
viceEmployees lnternatlonal Union Local 32BJ.

and the SEIU, Siegert said, often come about
when the parties intend to avoid long and
costly court proceedings. ' K
' SEIU spokesman Matt Painter said that
the settlement ended up as “more or less what
would happen out of a longer trial process.” .
Sodexo spokeswoman‘ Monica. Zimmer
said that she would not comment beyond a
statement issued ‘by company spokesman
Alfred King.

activities or otherwise supporting a union,”
he said in an e-mail. . . ‘ --

King said it became easier to reach a settle-
ment after Sodexo signed athree-year contract
with the SEIU agreeing to give workers a $1.40
raise over three years and contribute more to
their health care premiums.

Although the settlement did not punish
Sodexo, Painter said, that he viewed it as a
victory. ﬂ ‘

Don’t make

book for a week. It wouldn’t
be Doomsday, but 

Let’s outline a plausible sce-
nario. Well, for starters, the na-
ture of the on-campus workweek
would change tremendously. On
campus at least, no more would
most students find solace from
grueling hours of class inside
the security net of scouring their

friends’ proﬁles.
Without off—campus Internet
to run back home to, ﬁrst-year
students would take the biggest

I magine if Pitt blocked Face-

, hit, and the majority of students

without cell phone data plans
would follow.

For good or for worse, we’re
ionically bonded to social net-
working. If ripped away from
it for even days — let alone a
solid week — overall focus dur-
ing class time would likely dis-
sipate into nothingness. Clouds
of social ignorance —— the lack of
knowledge of goings-on between
friends, which we’re now so used
to — would swallow students’
minds and pull them down to a
dark place out from which. no
professor could dig them.

Diminished focus from the
student body means less’-produc-
tivity for the University, at least
for that Facebook-less week in
particular. And since semesters
are so compact, the productivity
loss of a single week could effect
signiﬁcant consequences on ﬁnal
exam performance and general
application of course knowledge‘

’ later in life.

At Pitt and at any institution

of higher education, blocking ‘

Facebook could turn into a big
deal —— potentially.
But administrators at another

V Pennsylvania school don’t seem

to think so. The truth is that for
other college students in our
state, the scenario is reality. And
it shouldn’t be.

On Monday the administra-
tion at Harrisburg University

of Science and Technology -— a. ‘

guinea pigs  

A 9-year-old institution — blocked

not only Facebook, but Twitter,
Myspace and AOL Instant Mes-

senger for a total of one week, '

according to an InsideHigherEd.
com article.

Quoting the school’s provost,
the article contends that the idea
for the Facebook-less week was
born out of a desire to teach stu-
dents the impact social media
has in their lives, not out of “a
curmudgeonly antipathy toward
Facebook.” In the eyes of the
administrators, by taking away
Facebook, they’re conducting an
“experiment.” And it’s not like
they’re testing the network.

Now we at The Pitt News are
all in favor of the scientiﬁc meth-
od —-— it’s produced a wealth of
knowledge across all ﬁelds that
we can trust is accurate. But as
respecters of good science, we
also respect that when experi-
ments involve human or animal
subjects, a rule must be followed
called the “Three R’s:” reduce, re-
fine, replace. The rule’s essence is
to only tovulse live subjects when
absolutely necessary.

To Harrisburg University and
all administrations inspired by
its social media educational cam-
paign: The Facebook experiment
fails the Three R’s.

We could launch into lengthy
discourseabout how a modern
university ought to grant its law-
abiding students certain Internet
rights, or contend that inter-gen-
erational misunderstanding ac-
tually birthed the policy, butthis
editorial has to ﬁt on half a page.
Flipping the lives of students up-
side down , and potentiallyseed-

—ing resentment for the university,

clearly’ invalidates the value of
this scientiﬁc “exercise.”

SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

Journalists - employ

more showmanship

I f journalists don’t fundamentally change their ways, they ’re a dying breed.

  
 
 

Jacob Brown
Columnist

It may sound a little absurd coming
from a guy who has written for this

newspaper for the better part of his —

college career, but it’s time to face
the truth: Journalism as we know it
should die.

Hoping to gain strength by gain-
ing size, newspapers are folding up,
consolidating and beingbought out
by larger corporations. Even the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette just laid
off 30 employees after revenues
slumped. Following the pattern, Pitt

‘ has wound down its journalism track

over the past two years.

I feel such job loss in skilled pro— .

fessions is atrocious — yet I have

_ no remorse for the Post-Gazetteor

any otherpaper that has cut its staff.
Why? Because newspapers are stuck
in a “Saw”-like spiked helmet.

Rather than try to ﬁnd a key
to unlock it, though, they’re sit-
ting around hoping that when that
timer goes off, the newspaper in-
dustry won’t ﬁnd a spike lodged in
its brain.

But it’s going to happen. That is,
unless they make a few changes.

’ Traditional journalism has relied '
on the same stagnant set of ethics to I

uphold reporting standards since
right after the Spanish-American

news at the turn of the 20th century .
to drive circulation at their’compet- ‘

Their “yellow journalism” struck
up a frenzy’ with alarming head-
lines and misleading halftruths. The
tactics and strategies Hearst and
Pulitzer employed make today’s net-
work news stations look unbiased
and straightforward.

The antics reached a head in
1898 when the USS Maine burst
into ﬂames in the Havana harbor
after being commissioned to protect
the Cubans from the Spanish. It has
never been proven whether or not
the Spanish blew up the ship, but the
publishers didn’t care.

In the following days, The jour-
nal posted a $50,000 reward for
whomever captured the “enemy”
responsible. The World displayed
pictures of a ﬁery boat being blown
apart on the front page. .

Bring more old school into thebedroom

 
 
  

Leah Trimble
Columnist

HBO primetime the Sunday before
last was heaven in a two-hour time
slot. For those of you who pay the
extra—channel fee every month, I
hope you’re able to remember the
moment in “Hung” that sparked
my interest. In a nutshell, the male
prostitute and his pregnant former
client are sitting in the bathroom
chatting. All of a sudden, in one
swooping motion, he reaches into
the tub where she’s bathing and
starts going at it on her lady parts,
sleeve rolled up and everything —
like he was prepared to get down
and dirty with his hand the whole
time! _

My jaw instantly dropped upon
seeing the water ﬂy as the woman
screamed her way to euphoria. I

can’t remember the last time I saw
(or heard about, for that matter)
an older woman getting ﬁngered in
the tub without any interruptions
and without proceeding to the next
activity.

Whatever happened to the hand _

job? You just don’t hear about some-
one receiving a “handy” anymore.
I’m not referring to a few initiation
strokes to get the mood going. I’m
talking about a full-length, start to
ﬁnish, no-mouth—involved hand
job. ’

Have we evolved past these
actions? Are college students too
mature to enjoy things that are
supposedly for teenagers and their
high school sweethearts? Maybe
those of us who are sexually active
think we’re past hand jobs or are too
impatient and want to move on to
bigger and better things.

If evolution and maturity aren’t
the issues, maybe most of us have

just become too lazy and impatient
to spend time doing the things
that we ,don’t consider important
enough for our (sex) time.

I suppose this would be the point
in the argument when someone old-
er, and possibly wiser, would make a
statement regarding our generation

You just don’t hear
receiving a ‘handy’

and the stereotype that we have of
needing to have and do everything
right now. We have cell phones that
ﬁt‘ in our pocket and don’t have
dial—up Internet or snail mail, so
everything has to be rushed  blah,
blah, blah. I’m going to leave out
this supposed correlation between
advances in technology and every-

I thing else in our lives, including sex.

I personally think that proceeding
straight to sex happens simply to
be a trend of the moment — like,
say, Brazilian bikini waxes.

I propose we change this trend.‘ V
Let’s be a little more amateur, as
some would describe it, and from,

about someone!
anymore.

time to time fool around — just
fool around, without intercourse,
for those of you who include casual
sex under the “fooling around” cat-
egory. It doesn’t have to be one of
the two acts referenced above. To
be honest, almost all of the guys
I’ve asked prefer their own hand to
another’s for a prolonged period of

time. The skyrocketing increase in
casual sex can take a timeout for a
change. Hey, we might eliminate a
few unwanted pregnancies.

Instead of only experimenting ,

with new things, we could be frisky
and experiment with old things as
well. In fact, slowing down and in-
volving different acts can seriously

’ increase the pleasure you feel during

the ﬁnale. The theory of practicing
delayed gratiﬁcation isn’t used only
to get through homework, guys.
It’s not about me telling you to
slow down when it comes t‘o your
sex life. That’s your own choice.
I justthink we should have a ﬁill

range of options when it comes to ‘

getting busy. That’s the great ﬁin

of it all. -

So remember, next time you’re
running around the bases, don’t
hesitate to stop at second. Think
about drawing a bath and getting
in some hand action. I

For survival, newspapers should embrace confrontation

Brown < 5 ,
now have awards for outstanding
journalism named after them..

So what does that have to do with
today’s journalism? The truth is writ-
ing today has gone soft. The ﬂare
of actively seeking readership as a
business has faded. And that’s why
this artI love so much is dying.

In no way do I believe we should
use sensationalism to create arti-
ﬁcial wars —— we’ve done a_ bit too
much of that lately as it is. But I do
believe that journalism needs a bit
more showmanship to it.

One policy especially lacking in
showmanship instructs journalists
to always identify themselves when
they’re out to get a story. It’s a noble

policy, but it just can’t compete any-
more.

With eyewitness accounts, blog-
ging and live feeds from anywhere in
the world, you can ﬁnd out instantly
anything you want to. Buying print
publications has largely become
an exercise in ﬁirnishing packing
products when you’re too cheap to

, buy bubble wrap.

What people want from peri-
odicals -— and what newspapers
need to make money — is a certain
amount of sensationalism. That’s
why Americans still watch soap op-

eras and pro wrestling: We crave the '

ridiculous.
Take the article ESPN.com

pulled on LeBron_]ames’ Las Vegas
vacation injuly. Editor—In— Chief Rob
King said he quashed it because he

-“found that [writer Arash Markazi]

did not properly identify himselfas
a reporter or clearly state his inten-
tions to write a story.” _ '

I read the story after someone
had saved it on Deadspin.com, and
I didn’t think it presentedjames any
differently than I already imagined
him — as a 25-year-old kid. It really
wasn’t that salacious.

Yet ESPN missed another Ro-
ethlisberger-sized story because
of a relatively minor misstep, and
Deadspin probably took in a few
thousand new hits. It further so-

lidiﬁed how antiquated journalism
has become.
Reporting has become increas-

_ ingly an art in avoiding confronta-

tion and pandering to the whims

— of the powerful. When Mayor Luke

Ravenstahl ﬁled for divorce from his
wife, Erin, rumors circulated that he
had an extramarital affair, according
to the Tribune—Review.

But we’ll never know. Ravenstahl
hired a hot-shot lawyer from Philly
for the sole purpose of making sure
his privacy was respected. Trans-
lation: His lawyer was more than
equipped to bankrupt any struggling
newspaper that date dive into his
personal life, with or without rea-

son.

So the boy mayor once again
crushed controversy, providing
little in the way of new material for
any of us to give two licks about.
And perhaps with the revenue the
newspapers didn’t generate, they
weren’t able to hire the next Hunter
S. Thompson or David Foster Wal-
lace.

Newspapers need not do a capital 1

restructuring to survive in the 21st

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

Stories that veer from unlikely cir-
cumstances to impossible ones, bi-
zarre tales and reimagined fairy-tale
myths. Prose that is delicate but sub-
stantial, ethereal yet unpretentious,
preposterous and unsettling.

Such is the experience of read-
ing Tina May Hall’s collection “The
Physics of  Objects,” pub-
lished by the University of Pittsburgh
Press yesterday.

The Hamilton College professor’s
collection was published as part of
her award for winning the Drue

e Heinz Literature Prize.

“It’s nothing I ever thought I
would win, but I sent my work every
year hoping. I was quite surprised
when I got the call that they chose
me!” she said of this achievement.

Hall said that she has always
worked with short-form literature
like the vignettes and short stories
that appear in her book.

“Maybe I don’t have the attention
span to sustain a long narrative arc.
Also, I like compressed, tightened
language, and I think there’s only
so much you can expect readers to
tolerate [of that length of writing].
It becomes very burdensome,” she
said. -

As a result, the collection’s ﬁnal
piece — a novella telling the story of
a couple trying to conceive —— was an
experiment for Hall. V

“I wanted to see if I could work
with a longer narrative arc, but in a
way that felt comfortable for me,”
she said.

She accomplished thatfeat by
breaking the story down into page-
long vignettes, which enabled her
to jump from moment to moment
in her characters’ lives without the
loss of emotional impact that can
accompany a piece told in a longer
format. She said that the vignettes
“kept everything together and mov-
ing forward.” . ’

Concerning the poetic and lyrical
nature ofher prose, Hall said that she
always thought it was important to
work on both poetry and prose, but
that she has “always kind ofknown
I was a ﬁction writer. I wish I could
write poetry, but I can’t. I certainly
like to read and hear it but at heart,
narrative is the thing I like to play
with.:: . p . V

Hall has held some of her stories
in the revision process for as long
as 10 years. .

“It’s hard for me to let a story go.
I love revising and seeing the way a
story develops, it’s the most pleasur-
able part of the writing process for
me,” she said.

“Usually when I start a story, I
start with a line that ﬂoats up out of
somewhere. It’s accurate to say that
[the stories] are very much about
language and putting disparate im-
ages next to each other. Those are
things that interest me,” Hall said.

‘ She said one of the themes that
intrigues her is “girls who wander,
women or girls who stray from the
normal or accepted path. There’s
also a lot of meanderingthat goes on.
I wanted.to explore what happens
when you get close to the edge of

things, when you go into the forest 

or off the beaten pa .”

.“I have this weird obsession
with Victorian scientiﬁc manuals
and books. Sometimes I’ll go into
stacks in the library and ﬁnd the
oldest scientiﬁc journals —— their
language really inspires me for some
reason. They always make me think
of a murder mystery,” she said. She
also keeps lists of words, images
and phrases that intrigue her for
inspiration. ' ‘ ' “ S‘ ' ', ’

I Many of Hall’s works boast ex-
traordinary names, including “Faith
Is Three Parts Formaldehyde, One
Part Ethyl Alcohol,” “Gravetending,”
and “By the Gleam of Her Teeth, She
Will Light the Path Before Her.”

-“I have a propensity for long
titles. For a short story, the title is
an important part —— it’s another

Getting into the “family business”

The arealhas produced more

Ben Aﬁleck’s. gritty crime thriller,

Three years after his acclaimed

Boston to get behind —. and this .

Aﬂleck plays the ﬁlm’s unlikely
protagonist, Doug MacRay, who is
trapped in a rotating cycle of robber-

ALBUM REVIEW

Sufjan regains creative spirit for songwriting

After posing the question “What’s the point of making music anymore?” Suﬁan Stevens releases a new ER

Merritt Wuchina
Staff Writer

Sufjan Stevens

All the Delighted People EP
Grade: A-

Rocks Like: A hymn amidst
a hurricane

Sufjan Stevens, the indie—folk
icon who took us from Michigan
to Illinois, unexpectedly released
a 60-minute EP in late_last month
that will surely surprise and en-
tice fans. l
Despite his discouraging com-

ments last year to Exlcaim! maga~
zine when he stated, “What’s the
point of making music anymore?”
Stevens has rediscovered his
spark for songwriting. Although
he commented that download-
ing music has made his work
“obsolete,” he has released the

_ entire EP for free streaming on

bandcamp.com with only a $5
downloading fee. .

If you were lucky enough to
catch Stevens on his 2009 fall
tour, you may recognize the
opening title track. It begins
with Stevens’ creeping voice and

_continues to build with an ac-

companying choir, strings and
horns, displaying many of the
classical conventions heard in
his previous music.

 

Although Stevens almost never
discusses religious beliefs in in-
terviews, his lyrics often contain

spiritual themes. Here he alludes’
to Simon and Garfunkel’s “The

Sound of Silence,” singing, “And
the people bowed and prayed/
to the neon god they made/ and
what difference does it make?”
The gothic piano ballad, “The
Owl and The Tanager,” tells a sto-
ry of a violent love, while “Djoha—
riah” is a full—choired guitar jam
about a mother’s struggle.
While almost every song on
the EP seems delicately crafted
and composed, listeners could

probably do without the repeated
“classic rock version” of “All De-
lighted People.” We heard it once,
now let’s move on.

Strangely enough, this EP.for
“delighted people” is remarkably
dark and clearly Stevens has
abandoned his musical pioneer-
ing across all 50 states. But like
many great musicians, his sound

_ has continued to grow and evolve

into something much deeper and
emotional. This EP wil1_p1‘obably
just be a foreshadowing of what
to expect for his next studio
release, “The Age of Adz,” this
October. . l .

a guys’ night out. The action comes
at a surprising pace, pulling audi-
ences to the edges of their seats.
However, as loudly and suddenly
as it comes in, it quickly dissipates
to be replaced by a brooding Affleck,
conﬂicted by his obligations to “the

life.

I left “The Town” wondering to
myself, “Was that really the same
Ben Affleck of the ‘Gigli’ and ‘Jersey
Girl’ abominations? Did that man
actually don red spandex for one of

his ﬁlms? Is it true he was nominated ‘

foraRazzie Award in the category of
‘Worst Actor of the Decade?’”

The answer to all three is “yes,”
but “The Town”_ serves as a bridge
from his past follies to his future
potential as a ﬁlmmaker. As Aflleck
develops himself as a director I be-
lieve we will only see better from
him.

The former walk_- on worked for four years to start, received a scholarship

— Ben Livingston
Staff Writer

Ever since walking on to Pitt for a
redshirt year in 200 6, Alex Kara-
bin has been fighting to’ prove

.. that he can be a starting center.

He’s had the competition for the
starting job ‘paraded in front of
him season after season, but now,
as a redshirt senior, he’s finally
getting his chance to start.

“It was a little frustrating,”
Karabin said. “It was more moti-
vational. You just want to always
show.thatyou’1_'e getting‘ better,
keep working atit and hopefully,
eventually, atone point nobody

‘ can beat you out.”

. chance to show you know it after that.” H

But Karabin kept on getting chances,

due in large part to having earned the '

coaching staff ’s respect. For instance,

Wannstedt lauds Karabin for his ‘intel- '

ligence.

“He’s a smart player, one of the smart-
est on our team,” Wannstedt said. “His
playing experience will be the only thing
that we’ll have to get caught’ up on. As far
as identifying things and making calls, he’s
really good. That’s probably what gives
him a little bit of an edge.”

Wise has always admired Karabin’s
personality and knowledge of the game,
stating that he has different'stre'n'gths‘[than
previous starting center Robb Houser.

“He doesn’t have as much range as
Robb Houser did, but he’s powerful at the

point of attack. He’s extremely tough,”
he said. _

“Tough” is exactly what Karabin had to
be to get his starting role and scholarship.
I-Ie’s gone through four years of long, gru-
eling practices at Pitt in order to achieve
both of those goals.

But now he must meet the‘ challenges
of establishing himself and helping the
entire offensive line prove their mettle.
Jason Pinkston and Lucas Nix return at
tackle, yet the interior features three new

, starters: guards Chris Jacobson and Greg

Gaskins, as well as Karabin.

The ﬁrst tour of duty for this new line
was a struggle. 4 .

Pitt running back Dion Lewis, consid-
ered by many to be a serious candidate
for the Heisman Trophy, managed only

year

75 rushing yards on 25 carries, in part due
to the line’s inability to create the sort of
holes that it did last year. Lewis couldn’t
muster much on the ground against New
Hampshire, either. »

Yet, the line did pave the way for Ray
Graham’s ﬁrst 100-yard rushing output
of his career last week against the Wild-
cats. I ' .

Wise notes a need for improvement,’but

- thinks that defenses focusing on Lewis and
Graham will make the offensive 1ine’s job

much harder than it was last year.

’ “Dion is a marked man. Every time
we go out there, it’s going to be difﬁcult.
[Defenses] are going to make sure that

‘Dion does not do what he did last-year,”

he said.“The guys understand that re-
sponsibility.” ! '

, Good riddance: The NFL actually. isn’t
that exciting. -

Football players do a lot of standing I

around. According to a Wall Streetjournal
study, the average NFL broadcast lasts 174
minutes. In those nearly three hours, the
ball is in play on the ﬁeld for an average
of 11 minutes. In comparison, “players
standing around” make up 67 minutes of
the broadcast.

In contrast, the entirety of NBA games
(48 minutes) and NHL games (60 min-
utes) consist of, well, the game. When play
stops, the clock stops — unlike in football. -
The.NFL, though, does give you plenty of
time to chat with your friends. A

The pinnacle of football excitement
is the touchdown, but 32 teams together
