BY BILL MOORE

The uncertainty over the amount
of money in the Student Govern-
ment (SG) budget has yet to be
cleared up, but ﬁgures released
yesterday by SG advisor Nancy
Evans suggest the budget has not
been overspent.
pg According to Evans, the estima-

fated total funds in the SG account‘

4

for this year are $5,660.51, but that

ﬁgure is based on .probably income,

not on actual income.

The ﬁgure was arrived at by
subtracting total commitments
made by the SG Allocations
Committee as of October 1, 1975,
from the estimated income SG will
receive from '74-’.75 student
activities fees.

It was believed earlier that the
SG budget already had been
overspent, and the Allocations
Committee refused to consider new
budget requests or emeraennv

_ allocations requests until the ﬁscal

 p

aLivewire: StudentAttacks Unjust Degree Denial

 situation was cleared up.

Allocations member Patty Coop-
er said yesterday the Committee
would discuss the new ﬁnding
Thurs_day to determine what the
committee's next step will be.

“We recommended to the SGB
(Student Government Board) last

 

someone noted.

In line with new rumord recent priorities,

week that no more emergency
requests be heard,” Cooper said.
“In all probability, that recom-
mendation will stand, but that is for
the whole Committee to decide.”
Cooper pointed out it may be
necessary to hold the $5,000 until
the end of the year to coverany
debt incurred by student organiza-
tions. “Five thousand dollars is
not really a lot of money and we
have an obligation to the programs
we have already funded,” she said.
“We don’t have much money to
work with,“ SGB President Larry
Platt said yesterday when advised
of the estimated balance. “We’ll
just have to be prudent.” «

Platt said he thinks more money‘

will be available after an audit of
the SG account. “I think there is
probably a mistake in the amount
of deﬁcits we were charged for last
year,” he said. --

Evans also mentioned the
possibility more money will be
made available after a review of
last year’s deﬁcits. .

The Allocations Committee
works each year with estimated
ﬁgures because the exact amount is
directly related to the number of
full-time‘ students paying their
tuition bills and activities fees. The

In contract dispute

Students Support Police 

BY DAN KOHUT S

A contract dispute between the
campus police and the University
involving wage reopening and
subcontracting clauses has gener-
ated some support for the police
from sororities.

Diane Kennedy, president of
Theta Phi Alpha sorority, voiced
strong support .for the campus
police. “It’s stupid to even think of
replacing the police ofﬁcers with
unarmed security guards poorly
trained in relating with the
students,” Kennedy said. V

Kennedy met with Inter Frater-
nity Council ’ (IFC) President Ed
Riefenstahl and a student govern-
ment representative Monday after-
noon.

Riefenstahl said he is pursuing
the matter, but declined further
comment.

Pitt Labor Relations Specialist]
Thomas Cherry said the University
would protect individual police
ofﬁcers’ jobs.

Only two jobs would be affected
on campus by the subcontracting
clause, Cherry said.

Kennedy also complained about

what she claimed was a shortage of
ofﬁcers.

“Campus police are working the
afternoon (3-11‘p1_n)_" and night (11
pm-7 am) shifts with a shortage of
police officers,” Kennedy said.

“‘It’s unfair to the students who

depend on campus police for
protection and other services.”

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham said in some cases ofﬁcers
may- call off sick, and the
supervising ofﬁcer in charge of the
shift may have to pull ofﬁcers from
other posts to ﬁll in where needed.
“It’s the shift commanders’ re-
sponsibility to place the men where
he feels they are needed,” Graham
said.

Seven officers were off during
the night shift Monday because of
training classes held during the
day, ‘Graham said.

Campus police union committee
members met with attorneys from a
law ﬁrm specializing in public
sector labor relations Monday
afternoon, according to Robert
Kolesky, steward for the campus
police chapter of Local 249
International Brotherhood of

Frank Mazzei  

Resigns From
Pitt Trustees

Former K State Senator Frank‘
VMazzei resigned Monday from his ‘.
post on the Pitt Board of Trustees. '

Mazzei, a South Side Democrat, ‘

sent a letter Monday to Board
Chairman William H. Rea, saying
he was resigning immediately.

No reason was given for his
action.

Mazzei was voted out of the
Senate this summer after being
convicted last year of extorting
$20,000 inkickbacks. ‘

He also was found guilty of
perjury on September 30 on
charges growing out of his earlier
conviction.

Mazzei was appointed to the
Board in 1973. ‘

Teamsters .

Kolesky said the problems:
occured when the University stood. .

ﬁrm on subcontracting private
security guards and the men voted
down the 40-cent hourly rate
increase. '
Cherry countered Kolesky’s
charge, saying the University

would not agree to totally prohibit:

the subcontract clause.

According to Cherry, the plan '
called for subcontracting security ;

guards for buildings and putting

more commissioned police ofﬁcers’

on the street to provide” better
protection, while saving moneyin
the process. _ .‘

Kolesky said poor police man-
agement is responsible 'for the
shortage of police ofﬁcers on posts,
because they pull patrolmen from
higher crime areas to ﬁll in

-elsewhere when shifts are short..

Graham said when there i‘s a

shortage‘ on a given shift the

lieutenantﬁlls those positions he

feels rate priority. '
Kolesky mentioned last week the

police probably will not walk 5off

their jobs.

A student has approached the Livewire complaining
that he will be unjustly denied a Bachelor of Science degree
in mathematics when he completes his masters program in
graduate school.

After completing three years at Pitt and taking all
required courses for a degree in math, he was accepted to
Carnegie-Mellon University (C-MU) in a graduate
program. He said under the graduate or professional
school degree option program that it stands to reason he be
awarded his undergraduate degree upon completion of the
graduate work. I

The student will finish his masters in Urban and Public

 Affairs at C-MU in May and has been informed ‘that to

 

‘V “The ,»-_graduate:-'“ school option, to which the

receive his bachelor degree he must ﬁnish 15 elective
credits. '

referred, stipulates that a student complete 96 credits at

Pitt towards his degree, fulﬁll the distribution-of-studies

requirement and‘ be accepted as a degree candidate by the

graduate faculty of any department in the Faculty of Arts'
and Sciences at Pitt. The student may receive an

undergraduate degree, after successfully completing one

year of graduate work and earning his graduate degree.

The student said since Pitt accredits C-MU as an
academic institution through cross-registration, it should
also credit C-MU for the graduate option program.

The student does not qualify under this program because
he did not attend a Pitt graduate school, according to Dean
of_ College of Arts andsciences Robert Marshall.

“Before this student receives his bachelor degree, he
must earn it,” Marshall said. “We say this to
approximately 9,000 students.” I

only for students going to one of Pitt’s graduate schools.
“The student did no fulﬁllthe one condition of going to
graduate school at Pitt and thus cannot be awarded his
undergraduate degree,” Marshall said. .

We are in essence allowing students to skip their senior
year under very limited conditions,” Marshall said. “It is
the narrowness of these limitations that makes it A
possible. ’ I

‘ ‘This is a two-for-one type of program where the student
is awarded two years of work for one,” Marshall said.
“Only about a dozen students have done this in the last few
years and one has to be pretty exceptional to be accepted
into a graduate program without a bachelor's degree.”

As to why Pitt accepts C-MU cross-registration and not
the graduate program, Marshall said, “Cross registration

Student evaluation of teaching at .
- Ritt soon will be the subject of an V

investigating task force, Provost

Rhoten Smith reported at Mon-

day’s Senate Council meeting.
The committee will examine the

validity of student evaluations and ,_

their_use to students, faculty and
administration. A

‘.‘It would be of interest to
students as an evaluation of a
factual nature regarding exams,
lectures and interest of the
course,” Smith said.

“It might be of interest to faculty
in improving teaching methods.

yThe committee would also investi-

gate the use of student evaluations
as part of an over.-all evaluation of
faculty, perhaps ‘for tenure pur-
poses.”

Smith also reported that the

Pittsburgh Council on Higher’

Education and the American
.Association of Universities is
interested in following the project.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar an-
nounced statistics on changes in
the number of faculty and staff

_ employed at the University.

“We’re at a steady state in terms

. of faculty and staff. There is a small

increase in the health professions
through hiring by the hospitals,”
Posvar said.

'In his report, the Chancellor

Posvar reported‘ several admin-
istrative changes, including the
combination of the astronomy and
physics departments and formation
of the new life sciences depart-
ment.

The life sciences department is a
combination of the biology, bio-
chemistry, biophysics and microbi-
ology departments.

In his report to Council, Senate
President William Brown discussed
a previous Council resolution
calling for a collective bargaining
informational meeting of the
Senate.

“The resolution to hold a special
informational meeting of the
Senate has failed because it is just
impossible to implement at this
time,” Brown said. “Efforts are
being made to structure some kind
of agreeable format for both
sides.”

In a report by student members
of the Council, Student Govern-
ment President Larry Platt mo-
tioned that the Council formally
support “Tiger Paul” Auslander,
who was ousted as an unofﬁcial
basketball cheerleader last week by
the athletic department. '

Diagnostic clinic

A free diagnostic clinic is being
sponsored by the Student Govern-
ment Medical Action Committee
this Friday.

Everyone in the University
community may get blood pressure
tests, urinalysis, blood tests,
EKG’s, and vision and hearing
tests free of charge.

The clinic will be from 10 am to 6
pm in the SU Ballroom and

“Students respond to Tiger Paul
as a cheerleader, and we would like
to see Tiger Paul be able to cheer at
games,” Platt said.

After short discussion, Senate
Council voted to refer Platt’s
motion to the Senate Athletic
Committee, as suggested by FAS
Dean Jerome Rosenberg.

Platt also said there was a six
percent return on- the advising
survey sent to students earlier this
year. A random sampling of 3,000
students received the survey, Platt
said.

Senate . Athletic Committee
Chairman Herbert Chesler report-
ed that, according to rules of
intercollegiate competition, 20
male athletes, and 10 female
athletes at Pitt are not academically
eligible to compete.

“This is the count we have right
now although some of these
athletes have removed themselves
from intercollegiate athletics,”
Chesler said.

Chesler also discussed the
Athletic Committee’s proposed
agenda for the coming months. The
Committee plans an appraisal of
Pitt’s criteria for academic eligibil-
ity and a review of admissions
credentials of students enrolled last
year, Chesler said.

“The Committee will also be
working to prepare a booklet and a
letter explaining to student athletes
situations affecting academic eligi-
bility and scholarship assistance,”
Chesler said.

In other action, Senate Council

standing committees of the Senate,

BY MARGARET l’i:'.la:KAY

Robert Louis Stevenson once

wrote, ‘‘I travel. not to go
anywhere, but to go. I travel for
travel’s sake.”

Few students can make Steven-
son's claim. Many, especially
those from out of state, have
enough problems arranging an
occasional trip home, let alone trips
elsewhere.

The biggest obstacle to student
travel, aside from lack of funds, is
lack of transportation. What can
the average student do when he
doesn’t have access to a car, he
can't afford plane fare, travelling
by bus takes too long and trains
can’t be found?

At Pitt, a student can advertise
his plight with signs on the walls
and cards on the University’s swap
boards in the Student Union. Then
he must sit back and wait, hoping
his cards aren’t covered and that
someone sees them. This system
of chance, while satisfying a few
students, disgruntles many.

One student, Ezra Krieg, feels
there is a deﬁnite need for a more
efficiently organized ride center, so
he’s researching the ride centers of
other area colleges. “I don’t

consider this a one-man crusade
against anything," he said. ‘‘It's
just something .that_’_s needed,”

The ride center Krieg seems to
favor’ is“ the ' one in use at
Carnegie-Mellon University.
C-MU’s ride board consists of a US
map divided into sections. The
major cities are numbered, and
each number has its corresponding
cubby hole into which cards (listing
destination, time and whom to
contact) are placed.

“Where we're at now,” Krieg
said, “is ﬁguring out where the
need is. Does Pitt want to be
simplistic or sophisticated?” The
ideal ride center, according to
Krieg, would have the ﬁve area
colleges working together.

Krieg has approached several
student groups, such as the
Student Activities Ofﬁce and the
Student Government Board, and he
is encouraged by their interest.

“I hope that the existing
committees will give me a hand.
What I want from the Student
Government is encouragement and
support, but I don’t know how
much ﬁnancial "support I can
expect.”

Although Krieg hasn’t ap-
proached the Commuter Associa-
tion yet, he feels that group should
be able to help also because the
issue “directly affects them.”

In an effort to determine student
opinion‘-of the present system, the
Pitt News called a dozen students

A Bleak

BY w. JACK ROMBERG

“There is no sentiment for
control because President Ford
didn’t get killed.”--a senate staff
aide [Newsweek, October 6].

The President could not sleep I

well that night. There was too
much on his mind. Rather, there
was too much he could not
comprehend. In the 37 years he
had been in politics, this was the
ﬁrst time he had ever wanted to
quit.

He looked out the window and
watched a column of smoke and ﬁre
trail into the sky as some distant
part of Washington burned.

“A ﬁre missle must have gotten
through,” he thought aloud. He
regretted having to make a decision
that would send a similar bomb to
another part of a once united
country. The President wondered
if the President of Dallas, or Los
Angeles, ‘or Chicago, felt the same
remorse over launching bombs, or
if they were really the unfeeling
machines the war press was so fond
of portraying.

Personally he felt like a pawn in a
particularly gruesome game. That
was the cause of tonight’s
depression, and frustration.

Years ago, when Washington

was the capital of the entire country _

and not merely of the East coast, he
had been a congressman, one of
the youngest and the most
outspoken. He, had sponsored
many bills, especially "for educa-
tion, that he believed were for the
people’s welfare. This activity led
to his being the youngest speaker
of the house in the history of
Congress. But that was over 20
years ago. ' A

It was 12 years ago that
California seceded from the rest of
the country, and no one bothered to
prevent it.’ lhstead, many people
were even relieved, » because
California was always more prob-
lems than it was worth. . .

It’s almost funny, but that was
the same feeling the President had
had when New York was wiped out
last year, more relief than regret. .

And that was the feeling he was
beginning to despise. ' ’

Silently heucursed the “acci-.

dent” -that ele’vated"him to the
presidency. VThe President and
Vice President had been .in the

BY DAN MULHOLLAND.

Much has been written recently
about the newly established_Center
for Arms Control and International
Security Studies here at Pitt". This

new Ford,Foundation Project was
I instituted to restimulateinterest in

arms control, with a special
emphasis given to the social
science aspects of the problem.

While «initial. enthusiasm for any
new program is understandable,
the members of the University
community should be on guard that

. it.does not gooverboardi. Indeed,

many individuals would ‘question

the value o.f having such a program

because the concept involved,vas
well as the sponsoring organiza-
tion, is at best suspect.~ ’

Let us examine the idea of arms
control first. Its ‘defenders

«vehemently believe it is the only

hope for the survival of mankind,
and that anyone who opposes it is a
warmonger. This false assumption

. has been repeated loud enough and

long enough by the establishment
media that it is now believed by a
large number of Americans, a
perfect example of the Big Lie
technique. But after a more careful
look at the issues, it becomes
evident that arms control is nothing

‘ less than nationalsuicide. Thanks‘

to the recent sellouts in the name of
detente, the United States has its

‘ offensive and defensive strategic '
hvwcapons frozen at». a point. well '-
’ below that of the Soviet-Union. "At

same room when the letter bomb
exploded.

The President leaned back and
put his feet on his desk. He wanted
to quit, but why?

Remorse was certainly part of it,
but he had always been able to
rationalize launching bombs as just
“doing his duty.” Neither was be
tired of politics, for even quasi-
authoritarian politics required a
knowledge of under-the-table
maneuverings he still enjoyed.

“This is Ken, Mr. President.
The opposition party leader has
threatened violence if you do not
order a forceful retaliation for last
night’s bombing. Propaganda
chief wants to know your reply."

Something in the President's
mind snapped. He knew he would
resign. “Tell the chief I'll meet
with him at 8:30. I’ll have an
announcement then."

The President had forgotten that
he lived in fear of the bombs, too.

He was afraid. In the last nine
months alone he had survived a
dozen assassination attempts. His
position had aged him fast. The
burden of being in constant peril
had become too much for him. He
wanted to _quit.

Morning was coming and the‘

President noticed that the ﬁre still
burned out of control. He was not
surprised. The ﬁre department
was so overworked it was probably
willing to let half the city burn
down so it would not be bothered
anymore. If the ﬁremen were tired
of their duty, couldn’t he be tired of
his?’

His aides would argue that the '

people needed an ' example of
bravery to follow, not a quitter.
“Thepeople live in fear of the
ﬁre bombs,’ ’ he thought to himself.
“Is my fear of assassination so
much more frightening than that?”
The Presidentchided himself for
being a coward. The phone rang.

then why does he give

probably pulled off of the B020 the
clown show and allow him to try to
lead the cheering at Pitt Football
games. This person not only
cannot arouse the students, but he
can't even get himself up for the

Today's Africa:
Struggle, Setback

The forces of progress against
colonialism and neocolonialism in
Africa are winning new grounds

. increasingly but not without

setbacks. The near liquidation of
the struggle in Zimbabwe by
neocolonialist forces and their
agents is one example, Angola is
another. A few weeks away from

the independence of Angola, the

imperialists and racists have
engaged in a relentless terminal
struggle to frustrate the obvious
victory of the patriotic forces of
Angola over colonial domination.
This victory is the result of more
than 14 years of violent struggle
against slavery and colonialism.
Similar to other states in Africa,
Angola was seized by Portugal, one
of the decaying European imperi-
alist countries as early as the

14005. From then on, the people of
Angola had undergone different

phases of oppression ‘and exploita- ‘

tion ranging from slavery in the
hands of Portuguese and European

' capitalists and merchants to

outright colonial subjugation. And
presently, they are the object of
neocolonial intrigues.

Occupying a strategic position in
Southern Africa, the South African
and European money-bags re-
garded Angola as buffer zone
between, the racist regimes of
South Africa and Rhodesia and
independent Africa, and as a base
for NATO armed forces. With the
death of the Atlantic slave trade,
Angola, like other countries in
Africa, was turned into a booty of
natural resources for the imperial-
ist world with Salazar of Portugal
as the overseer.

Diamond-mining in . Angola
(3,000,000 carats annually) is
controlled by the Diamang Com-
pany whose stockholders include
the Anglo-American corporation of
South Africa, the US Morgan
banking house, and the Belgian
ﬁnancial monopoly Societe Gener-
ale de Belgique. The country's oil:
output (6,'000,000 tons a year) is
US Gulf Oil
Corporation headquartered in!
Pittsburgh, and iron-mining
(7,000,000 tons yearly) by the West
German Krupp syndicate and the
British and American-controlled
Companhia Mineira do Lobito.

Freeing Angola from the clut-
ches of domination therefore spells
havoc and doom for the imperialists
and buttresses the liberation

struggle of the Azanians [South_

Africa], Namibiansl [SW Africa],
and the people of Zimbabwe
[Rhodesia]. . I .

Restive of the politico-economic

implications of Ang'ola’s victory on

Southern Africa, shattered by the

victory of the progressive forces in t A ’ ‘T

Mozambique, the imperialist-
backed regimes of “Rhodesia” and
“South Africa” are trying their
best to futilize the. just struggle of

the people of Angola for peaceful '

and independent development.
Having tried unsuccessfully to
dampen and confuse the issues
with scheme of “dialogue,” the
imperialists therefore are making
their last bid either to destroy the
gains of these long years of bitter
and heroic struggle of the African
masses, or at least to carve out
areas of neo-colonial inﬂuence in.
Angola. , .
Having limitedly used Zamhlas
neo-colonial henchmen to extin-
guish the struggle in Zimbabwe,
the imperialists are using Mobutu
[Zaire] to undermine Angolan
patriotic forces. ‘They have created

within Angola itselfa reactionary. ' A

group [FNLA], and through this
group they hope to balkanize ‘the

country and create puppet govern- .

ments.
But the struggling’ masses of
Angola and Africa know too well

the degradation and pangs of the —

vulturistic pounces of capitalism on
their lives and natural resources to
give a foothold on Angolan soil to
the agents of international capital.

Because of this conditioning, it is

Nancy added she would consider
a lifetime relationship if she felt
deeply enough for someone.

Contrary to what often is
believed about lesbians, Nancy
does not hate men. “I feel anger
toward certain men—powerful men
who oppress women,” she. ex;
plained. “But I would never
hesitate to and I do have men as
friends. I don’t hate my father and
Ithink my brother is just as cool as
my sister.”

“Ma1e hatred won’t change
men’s attitudes," she stated.

She doesn't think that extremism
is productive. Some women are
over the line, according to Nancy,
and this is damaging to the
movement.

First, she believes there must be
legal changes; laws making homo-

sexual acts illegal must be
changed. “It’s really ironic. They
arrest a man for a homosexual act
and then put him in a cell with a
bunch of men.”

Laws concerning discrimination
against homosexuals also must be
changed. “A man who was gay

but gay men are not knowingly _

Nancy doesn’t think a person’s
private sex life is relevant to his

professional life. She is a case in;

point.
Nancy is intelligent,. well-
informed and articulate. In April
she will have a degree attesting to
her competence in economics.
Whether society will judge her by
her talents or by her sexual
preferences is yet an unanswered
question.

_   Duo reviews

;Who Debuts New ‘Numbers’

BY TOM WASELESKI

; The Who by Numbers, The Who
— MCA Records, MCA-2161.

This review is almost doomed
from the start since practically
nothing a critic says will dissuade

— A . Who fans from buying the group’s
; B latest album. Everything this group
2:9, does turns gold in a matter of
.« w'eek-s,. so why review the Who?

« Seriously, though, The Who by
Numbers will not turn you on after
one play, and even after a dozen
listenings you still may be

 disappointed. This monumental
‘group that goes from straight rock
. to symphonic opera to synthesized

epic ‘without losing’ that easily
recognizable core of sound has
thrown a real bafller to the masses
this time.

What it all boils down to on this
record is how you perceive the
Who at its best. If you see Tommy

 as the crowning achievement, you
 lose.

 '

Possibly the best of the lot,
“Imagine a Man,” faintly resem-
bles the classic “Behind Blue
Eyes” and speaks of human failure
on both the personal and social
levels. A good, serious piece,
typical of Pete Townsend's musical
introspection. '

It should be said that a lot of the
lyrics on the album are autobio-
graphical, though not in the sense
of Elton John’s recent Captain
Fantastic and the Brown Dirt
Cowboy, where a. group tries to
impress you with its rough climb to-

fame and ﬂoundering. The Who
just says it and that’s it.

One noticeable weakness on The -4

Who by Numbers is that ﬁve songs
(half the album) begin with a few
notes on a guitar followed by the
tumultuous crash of Keith Mo’on’s
drums. This kind of intro for the
Who, already overused on previous
albums, is not exciting.

'l‘wo unusually easy songs pop up
on side two, one after the ‘other:
“They Are All in love” and .“Blue,
Red and Gray.” Nothing driving in
them at all, they could’ve been
written as one of those character
portrait tunes for one of the group’s
rock operas. -

Individual performances are up

' to par, which means dynamic. (Will

the Who ever die?) But the way
you digest this album will depend

on what you’ve eaten beforehand. _

  Poetry in Pittsburgh

Lacks True ‘Forum’ A

BY TOBI ROSEN
Arts Editor

Twentv-seven thousand people are starving to death. We needn’t
focus our eyes on TV screens on Bangladesh or the grapevines of
Ernest and Julio Gallo. _

Pitt’s own vineyards reek. of cultural depravity. And nowhere are
the pickins thinner than in the poetry world. Occasionally, the “patter
of little cat’s feet” will scamper through the doors of the International
Poetry Platform. »

I And Carnegie Museum’s contribution is just that-—a platform (as

opposed to a "forum") where published poets come to read and be-

heard. But after several hours they depart-whisked back to New York
or the inspirational mountains of Montana.

And in doing so, they destroy the “forum” atmosphere promised on
countless posters scattered throughout the city. A forum constitutes
discussion and interaction between the artist and his participants.

Many who step out for an evening of high “culcha” lavish in the
aura of respected poets with their esoteric mutterings. But those
craving an artistically disturbing experience will come away
unabsolved.

Lush red velvet chairs and podiums serve as buffer zones between
the poets and the people. It is truly a no-man’s land. -

But there are several alternatives to bridge the ever-widening gap
between the artist and his student audience.

The classroom is a common ground for all students, be they addicted
to cbmputers or busy battling biology. The poet should be integrated to
enrich any classroom-type learning experience._

Past attempts proved successful. California-based poet Ric Masten,
guitar on back, scribbles in hand, visited Pitt last year and received a
lukewarm reception’ from the faculty.

His readings warmed David Lawrence Hall packed with 300 Psych 80 ,

students, fulﬁlling their natural science requirements.

The second viable alternative is a coffeehouse; a discontinued Pitt
tradition that disappearedthree years ago. Possibly the lower lounge of
the Student Union could be designated as a place for local poets and/or
musicians to come and share their cries and talents on a regular basis.
Then during the week, specialized workshops and offerings could
expose the University community to a diverse beat of the prophet’s
pu se. '

If such a student organization were to make a return_ engagement, it
might ﬁll the ever-deepening void in Pitt’s “culture-oriented” student
organizations. -

  An End

BY ':r0M HALL
Associate Sports Editor

Randy Reutershan, a sophomore
economics major, is a split end with
the Pitt Panther Football team. He
is a very good split end and is
averaging 15 yards per reception.
He has caught one pass for 15
yards.

Reutershan plays on a football
team that has .some other wide
receivers: Karl Farmer, Willie
Taylor, Gordon Jones and Rodney
Clark, who aren’t bad, to say the
least.

50 how does a good wide receiver
distringuish himself on a team
chock full of talent at his position?
The answer is simple. He plays
with reckless abandon, constant
fervor and colorful excitement on
those bomb squads known as
specialty teams.

Reutershan is on defense for
kickoff and punt returns. He also is
the “Up-Back” on the teams that
try to block extra point and ﬁeld
goal attempts.

Sometimes he succeeds, some-
times he doesn’t. ‘

Number 19 can be spotted easily
on ' these specialty squads.
Reutershan usually starts left of
center, about half a yard behind the
line, and in most cases is the ﬁrst

‘man to the ball carrier (or place

kicker).

The scene is Veterans Stadium———
the game between Pitt and Temple.

The Owls’ Don Bitterlich is
attempting his second ﬁeld goal of
the afternoon. His first attempt
was blocked and returned for a
touchdown by Pitt’s J .C. Wilson.

“Uusually on a field goal
attempt,” Reutershan said, “what.
we try to do is come in to a point
about two yards in front of where
the ball is held for the ‘kick. You
have to get close enough so the ball
isn’t too high to reach,” he said,
"but you also have to watch
because the kicker’s momentum

carries him about a yard past the
point where the ball is kicked
from.”

On this particular attempt,
Reutershan and right side up-back
Jim Farley miscalculated. “I think
what happened,” Reutershan said,
“is that we came in a bit too

close.” This may be an
understatement. Bitterlich’s kick
from 40 yards was good. But

Bitterlich didn’t know it. He had to

wait for perhaps a minute or two,

until he regained consciousness.
“Ii’s a good thing for me he

made it,” Reutershan said, “or we
would have been assessed a
15-yard penalty for roughing the
kicker. It was really unintentional,
but you couldn’t have told (Temple
Coach Wayne) Hardin that.

“He was not too pleased with
that at all. He was yelling at the
head umpire for quite a while about
that one. '

“I don’t know about everyone
else, but Ilike the special teams. It
gives you a chance to play, and
they are a lot of fun.

“Coach Majors is always stres-
sing the kicking game and he takes

' a lot of pride in the performance of
his kick coverage teams. We take
pride in them too.”

And rightfully so. In last
Saturday’s contest, teams limited
Temple to an average two yards per
return on punts. I “You can’t give
any one person credit for that,”
Reutershan said. “But I would

Swider. He is not only kicking the
ball farther, but he’s also putting

' the ball higher than I’ve ever seen

him before.”

Turning back to Reutershan’s
position of split end, it might be
noted that a total of 13 passes have
been completed to the ends in the
ﬁrst five games.

“I’d like_to see us go more to the
wideends and I think as the season
goes on, we will be getting more
passes. But before we can throw,
we have to tune up the veer and
establish the running game.‘ Ithink
we’ve been doing that. .

looks to see some action there.

“I think we might very well
throw more against Army. We had
a good passing game against
Temple,- and I hope we’ll continue
to throw more all the time. The
Temple game gave us more
confidence.

“It’s fun when you win, and
when you’re having fun out there,
you’re going to go all out. You just
won't hold back.

“Temple was the game we were
waiting for. It was a total team
effort. The defense was spectacu-
lar and the offense showed
everyone just how explosive the
veer can be.

“This season has been, and will

continue to ‘be, a big challenge to

BY JIM LEWIS

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
who’s the toughest one of all?

That’s the question that will be
answered today when the Pitt
Soccer team travels to Indiana (Pa.)
University. A

Actually, when Pitt Soccer Coach
Leo Bemis looks at the Indiana
roster, it's as if he is looking in a
mirror——that’s how similar Pitt and
Indiana are.

“They don’t have a lot of great
personnel, but they play for breaks
and make good on them,” Bemis
said. /

“Indiana isn’t made up of
superstars,” he continued. “They
have a few good players and a lot of
hustle. You have to fight your

-way through them to score.”

The strong point of both teams is
their defense. Especially Indiana,
which stresses defense much more
than any other aspect of the game.

The game plan is this: everyone

stands around the goal and doesn’t
let the ball get through. When the
ball does roll toward Indiana’s end
of the field, all the players do is
kick it right back to where it came

. from.

Pitt prides itself on its- defensive
play, too. The Panthers may not
play as tight a defensive game as
Indiana, but they are ‘just as
outstanding in that phase of the

. game. So far the Pitt defensive

unit, made of goalie Frank ‘Bucci
and backs Andy Behrend, Kim
Blasko, Craig Connolly, Mark
Gannon and Ernie Gross, has
yielded just eight goals in seven
games, an average of about 1.14
goals per game.

The Indiana goals-scored total is
smaller than any of the Seven
Dwarfs— Indiana doesn’t concen-
trate on generating a high-scoring
offense. - . '

That could be where the
Panthers have Indiana by the
throat. .

Even though Pitt is not a
high-scoring offensive machine
itself (11 goals in seven games), the

   Norris Division Means Montreal    

BY STEVE SYBERT_ ._
(Last of a series)

Every .sport has its great,

" tradition-laden teams that won

championships, built dynasties and

V‘ 1‘ put awe into the hearts of all fans,

 to be outdone, hockey has the _

not just their own.
We all know them. Baseball has

"the New York Yankees; football,

the Green Bay Packers and
basketball, the Boston Celtics. Not

,_ " Montreal Canadiens.
; I The Canadiens are synonymous
with hockey. They have won an

unprecedented 18 Stanley Cups

1. L and have ﬁelded such all-time

greats as Howie Morenz, Doug
Harvey, Maurice Richard, Jacques
Plante and Jean Beliveau.

Today the names are Laﬂeur,

1‘ . Coumoyer, Mahovlich, Lemaire
7 and Dryden, but the Habs are still

at the top and will be challenging

A  the Philadelphia Flyers for this

\ .

year’s Cup.

Montreal is no doubt the class of
the Norris Division. Its 14 losses
last year was a National Hockey

A _, League (NHL) low, while its 113

points and 374 goals scored were
league highs.
Guy Laﬂeur scored 53 goals and

J was the NHL’s fourth leading

scorer with 119 points. Peter

Mahovlich was right behind with

"117 points on the strength of 82

5 assists. Add Jacques Lemaire’s 92 _

points and you have the league's
top offensive machine..

The “Roadrunner," Yvan Cour-
noyer (29-45-74), is slowing down
some, but is still a stride or two
ahead of everyone else and will
again be a major contributor this
year.

And the‘ Canadiens are loaded
with youth. Yvan Lambert (67
points) and Steve Shutt (65) are
leaders of‘ the youth movement,
which also includes second-year-
men Doug Riseborough and Mario
Tremblay.

Montreal will go with Ken
Dryden, now in his second year
back from a sabbatical, and Michel
Larocque in goal. The Canadiens
are so sure of their goalies, they
sold their third one, Wayne
Thomas, to Toronto.

Playing on the back-line will be

Guy Lapointe (28-47-75), Serge
Savard (60 points), Larry Robinson,
Pierre Bouchard and veteran Don
Awrey.
. The Canadiens may not have the
hard-hitting players Philadelphia
uses, but they can overwhelm any
team with their slick skating,
finesse and artistic passing. Not to
mention their tradition.

The division’s real race, though,
will be for second place, a spot for
which the offense-minded Pitts-
burgh Penguins will do battle with
the defensive Los Angeles Kings.

;.l_'h_e Penguins should prevail and

may even put a few scares into the
Canadiens, even after almost
becoming dead birds because of
the bankruptcy of their former
owners.

produced nine forwards who scored
20 or more goals and ranked fourth
in _the league in total goals with a
team record 326. The Pens tied
Boston for the least losses at home.

They had but five.

Captain Ron Shock (23-63-86) led
the attack, followed by Syl Apps,
who contributed 79 points, and
Jean Pronovost, who added 75
points with 43 goals.

But the Penguins do not let a
couple of stars carry the whole
team. They are marked with
consistency down to their last
forward. Ex-Ranger great Vic
Hadﬁeld posted a 31-42-73 season,
while rookie sensation Pierre
Larouche, Rick Kehoe, Lowell
MacDonald, Bob Kelly and Chuck
Arnason all scored 60 points or
more. ’

Defense will be the key for this
year’s club. Tough guy Steve
Durbano will be back after missing
the entire season last year with. a
broken wrist. Dave Burrows, a
veteran though still young, leads
the defense and is sometimes
called “the defenseman’s defense-
man.” Point man Ron Stackhouse
contributed 60 points in his double
role.

. Like every year past, the Pens’
goaltending spot is up for grabs.
Gary Inness has the inside track
because of his brilliance in the
Stanley Cup quarter-ﬁnals, but
Michel Plasse and. rookie Gordon
Laxton are very much in the
picture. Laxton, though, may
spend much of the year developing
in the minors.

The Los Angeles Kings, in an
effort to build an offense to go with
their stingy defense, grabbed
Marcel Dionne from the Detroit
Red Wings, but may have lost the
heart of their defense under
hockey’s version of the Rozelle "or
compensation rule.

Dionne (47-74-121) was the
league's third highest scorer last
year while playing out his option.
The Kings won the bidding for him,
but lost Terry Harper, their captain
and top defenseman, to the Red
Wings. Dan Maloney, the Kings’
third leading scorer, also went to
Detroit in the deal, which may
backﬁre if Dionne does not keep up
his hot pace.

But Los Angeles still has
goaltender Rogie Vachon, who, at
age 30, is just reaching his prime.
Vachon was the runner-up for both
the Vezina (best goalie) and Hart
(MVP) Trophies. His 2.24
goals-against average was second
to only that of the Flyers’ Bernie
Parent, who posted a 2.03. Backup
Gary Edwards (15-3-8 record and
2.34 average) gives LA perhaps the
best goaltending duo in the NHL.

Bob Nevin led the scoring with
72 points, while Mike Murphy was
right behind with,_68. Centers
Butch Goring and Whitey Widing
contributed 60 points each to an

' « Permanently laminated on

over-all meager attack. Dionne» had
better come through or else.

Bob Murdoch and Sheldon
Kannegiesser will be-counted on to
ﬁll the hole in the defense made by
Harper's departure.

The Detroit Red Wings are
leading the way of the established
teams out of the limelight. The
Wings have only two bonaﬁde goal
scorers—Mickey Redmond and
Danny Grant. Though out much of
last season, Redmondhas scored
50 or more goals on two occasions.
Grant tallied 50 goals and 36 assists
last year, but may not repeat that
performance without Dionne
-around to help.

Harper will be a leader in Detroit
as he was in Los Angeles, but will
not have much to lead. Bryan
Watson, Larry Giroux and rookie
Rick Lapointe are in for a long
season on defense. '

It will be even worse for the
goaltenders. The Wings were 16th
in goals allowed last year and will
try the likes of Jim Rutherford, Bill
McKenzie, Doug Grant and Terry
Richardson in the nets, with
Rutherford as the regular man.

What can you possibly say about
the Washington Capitals? They
have no offense or defense, no
goaltenders, no solid veterans and
no sensational rookies. In short,
they are bad.

The Caps did pick up Bill
Clement (21-16-37) from the
Flyers, but may have erred in
giving up their top draft choice.
Last year’s number one pick, Greg
Joly, was a disappointment, but is
looking to improve this year.

Tommy Williams led Washing-
ton in scoring with a 22-36-58 card.
Garnett “Ace" Bailey’s was
19-39-58. The next highest scorer
was Ron Lalonde with a mere 29
points. Goaltender Ron Low (5.45
average) will try again to keep his
goals-against ‘average lower than
his age.

Concepifor Sabbath A    

, BY JAMES SPARK
Sabotage, Black Sabbath‘:
Warner Brothers (BS 2822)

if, with quivering digits, you put
Black Sabbath’s. latest album on
the turntable expecting to be lifted
bodily from your chair by the
low-frequency vibrations, you're in
for a disappointment. This
Sabbath is really different from the
band that achieved notoriety with

I the heavy metal Iron Man.

Iommi, the left-handed guitar

I ‘genius, has ‘sped up the tempo

from his earlier throb to a quick,
rocking drive. The entire first side
of the album is very refreshing, if
conventional by rock standards.
lommi’s gallant axwork and vocal-
ist Ozzy Osbourne’s atonal wailing
create an excellent blend of
Sonics. lf, once again, you flip the
record over and expect more of the_
same, forget it. The four-piece
English band has thrown you
another curve, in the form of'a
guitar-chorus duet. ‘ This duet
involves Iommi and the English
Chamber Choir of Rick Wakeman
fame, doing a very unusual number
called “Superstar." Perhaps

“Supernaut" (Black Sabbath V0. 4)
for the name, Iommi really goofed
on this one. The concept has vast
potential, but Sabbath just doesn’t
pull it off.

Also on side two is what can be
described only as Sabbath’s ﬁrst,
and hopefully last, commercial cut,
“Am 1 Going Insane?" Thissoft
rocker has a. country flavor
background and_ is thoroughly
conventional, right down to the
recording of Osbourne’s baby girl
crying tacked onto the end, a la
Pink Floyd.. ‘

The album ltinishes up with a
long cut called “The Writ,” which
makes up for the rest of the music
on side two. As with most long
Sabbath numbers, it contains great
musical variety, and comes the
closest to the old Sabbath of
anything on this album.

Sabotage is a new brand of
Sabbath, similar to its previous LP
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in sonic
vocabulary, but totally new in
concept for this band. The whole
album is somewhat like the cover,
interesting in concept, brilliant in
spots, but. what with Geezer
Butler's groin thrust in your face,
somewhat less than it could have
been.

Cartoon Ironic

BY BILL MOORE

Wouldn’t a Gremlin

Been More Sensible?

G.B. Trudeau

Holt, Rinehart and Winston
pp. 130, $1.95

God forbid there would be ‘
anyone out there who has yet to
hear of G.B. Trudeau’s Doones-
bury comic strip, but if you
haven ’t, there is something terribly
wrong. '

Trudeau, who began his strip a
few years back while still attending
Yale, is taking up where Pogo left
off in the area of political cartoon
strips, as opposed to mere political
cartoons.

In this, the latest collectionof
Doonesburys, Nixon _is‘ conspicu-
ously absent. It was Nixon, of
course, who propelled Trudeau and
his characters to stardom and
prompted the strip’s appearance in
such papers as the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette, the Washington Post and
the Penn State Daily Collegian.

But theplethora of Watergate-
related jokes is gone, and Trudeau
has moved on to new material,
including Joan Caucus’ first days at
Berkley Law School; her roommate,
Virginia, and her roommate’s

And so they did.

Clyde, by. the way, purchases a
Buick Electra 225 with everything,
prompting Virginia to ask the
book's title question.

This volume also marks the
introduction of Uncle Duke, who,
you may have noticed, bears an -
uncanny resemblance to gonzo-

master Hunter 5_ Thompson_ with screaming kids with memories

of the war and their heroes.
Visions of deaf, dumb and rich kids ‘

The best of the varied subjects
are hard to v pinpoint. A good

Trudeau being painfully frank,
would be his week’s worth of strips’
on the busing problem, with
seven-year-old Bobby Matthews,
whose mother writes him a note to
show the other kids. The note asks
everyone not to hit him; Bobby
ﬁnally meets Malcolm, also seven,
but black, and with a mother with
similar fears. But it doesn’t sound
good at all when someone tries to
describe it. Doonesbury is made by
Trudeau’s ironic wit, and the plots
and subplots sound silly without it.
