Young people typically vote in

lower numbers than the rest of C

the U.S. population when it comes
to national elections. And when it
comes to Pitt’s Student Govern-
ment Board elections, the turnout
isn’t much better.

The leaders of SGB, the group
responsible for allocating more
than $2 million to student organi-
zations and promoting the inter-
ests of undergraduate students,
was decided by a mere 24 percent
of the student body last year.

SGB will hold its elections on ..

the my.pitt portal on Thursday,
Nov. 15, and the Board and its Elec-
tions Committee has been work-
ing throughout the year to try and
boost the turnout even more than
it did last year.

According to Annie Brown,
SGB’s elections committee chair-
woman, voter turnout has in-
creased over the last few years
and reached its peak last year. The
year before, voter turnout was at
19 percent.

The elections chairwoman for
2011 was Kari Rosenkaimer, who
graduated last May. Rosenkaimer
said SGB can only do so much to
increase voter turnout, which in-
cludes reaching out to clubs and
organizations.

“It’s not going to be an over-
whelming number. It’s not going to
be for any election,” Rosenkaimer
said. .
Rosenkaimer and her elections
committee raised the voter turnout
5 percent last year by setting up

reads,“Thank you for your valor and strength,” at the Veterans Day National Roll Call in the William Pitt Union. Luv Purohit | Assistant Visual Editor

Pete Blais
Staﬁ’ Writer

As Pitt’s vice chancellor for com-
munity initiatives, G. Reynolds
Clark has made a number of public
speeches before. But none quite
like this one.

On Monday, Clark stood before
a solemn crowd in the William
Pitt Union and recited a list of 50
names, each one a member of the
U.S. military that had died in ser-
vice in Iraq or Afghanistan.

During the event, which
spanned from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.,
the names of about 6,700 soldiers
who died in service were read aloud
in Pitt’s second annual Veterans
Day Roll Call. The reading, part of
a National Roll Call, was held by
the Office of Veterans Services in
the Union’s Lower Lounge to com-
memorate Veterans Day. The Diet-
rich School of Arts and Sciences,

College of General Studies and Pitt
Vets also helped coordinate and
conduct the event.

William Cole, a graduate stu-
dent and president of Pitt Vets, also
recognized the importance of the
event.

“We are trying to recognize
those who have died. I think this
is one of the most important things
we can do as a community for our
veterans,” said Cole, a former Ma-
rine.

The roll call, which was pro-
jected over speakers on the porch
of the Union and could be heard as
far away as the front entrance of
the Cathedral, required 134 read-
ers, each of whom read 50 names.
Reynolds said his thoughts were on
the families of the fallen as he read
through his part of the roll call.

“As you read each name, you
think, this was someone’s son, or
that was someone’s daughter, or a

husband, or a wife, or a father or
a mother,” Reynolds said. “It’s not
just that person, it’s all those people
around them.” 4

“It’s something we do if we lose
a member in combat — we’ll me-
morialize them by doing a roll call,’’
said Matthew Hannan, business
manager of Pitt Vets. “Typically,
somebody will call off names of
people who are still present. Last
called is the name of the person
that fell in combat.”

Hannan, who grew up in the
Pittsburgh area, is a 15-year veteran
of the Marines Corps and recently
returned to his hometown and
began his college education this
past fall at Pitt. Hannan, a reader of
names during the roll call, said this

event stood out because it lasted

so long.

“I’d say this is larger than the
events I would typically attend.
This duration of time is signiﬁcant-

ly longer. This honors the masses,
as opposed to the individuals,”
Hanﬁan said.

According to Janet Owens, out-
reach coordinator for the Office of
Veterans Services, the idea for a
national roll call originated at East-
ern Kentucky University and has
since been replicated, in various
forms, by nearly 300 universities
throughout the country.

“It’s a very solemn memorial
event. Schools can choose to read
names just from their state, or their
own current veterans,” Owens said.
“We chose to honor all of them.”

Clark, who served for seven
years in the Pennsylvania National
Guard, commended Pitt’s strong
relationship with the military.

“It’s part of our obligation as
a public research university to be
there and to reach out to those who

‘ have served,” Clark said. “Through our Ofﬁce

of Veterans Services, we’re doing a great j ob
in helping veterans transition back into civil-
ian life and pursue their educational goals.”

According to its website, the goal of the
Office of Veterans Services is to “facilitate
the transition of veterans from military to
University life, support their ongoing aca-
demic success, and assistveterans, guards-
men, reservists, spouses and dependents in
receiving their military education beneﬁts.”

Pitt has a long—standing relationship with

the military.

“Goingback to World War 11, military
ROTC cadets were housed in the Cathedral
of Learning,” Clark said. “They were in ac-
celerated programs to get them ready for
their military duty.”

Hannan said that as a former soldier
whofs been through combat, the event helps
him get closure.

“It helps you remember those you served
with and [who] fell, helps us get together to
remember what we did, why we served and
remember that there’s still soldiers out there
ﬁghting,” Hannan said.

Bryan Szczur, a senior marketing major
and Army ROTC member, was there Monday

morning with several of his peers to present
the colors to begin the roll call. I

“It’s good to honor the guys that have
fallen. It makes you think what other people
have been through compared to what I’ve
been through,” Szczur said. “It’s in complete
honor and respect of them.”

The Veterans Day service also included
a campus-wide moment of silence at 2 p.m.,
as well as a campus-wide collection for the
Wounded Warriors and Veterans Education
Assistance Fund. The fund was established
by Erik Rodenberg, a 2008 graduate of the
Katz, Graduate School of Business, in honor
of Sergeant Jeremy Feldbusch, a 2001 Arts
and Sciences graduate. While serving in Iraq,

 

a detonation caused Feldbusch to lose vision

in both of his eyes. —
“The fund,” Owens said, “was established

just for Pitt veterans to assist wounded war-

riors themselves or family members who lost

loved ones in the war.”
Each reader, upon completing his part of
the roll call, was also asked to write a thank-

‘you note to those currently serving.

5‘We’re going to put those thank-you notes
into boxes and send some goodies off to our
servicemen and women who are now serv-
ing,” Owens said. ,

Clark added, “I just think what anybody
can do is if you know someone who has
served or is serving, say thank you.” I

voting stations in convenient locations for
those students who couldn’t go online dur-
ing a busy school day. They set them up in
Market Central, Litchﬁeld Towers Lobby and
Sutherland Lobby so that students had the
opportunity to cast their vote while going
about their day-to-day activities on campus.

Comparing this election to the homecom-
ing election, Rosenkaimer said homecoming
election gets a greater voter turnout because
it’s over a two-day period, whereas SGB is
only a one-day event.

She attributes the recent upswing in vot-

J er turnout for the SGB election to students

being more aware of where their money is
going and who they want to see leading the
student body.

“Students are mo re aware that they play
a key role in helping students get what they
want,” Rosenkaimer said.

Brown, a senior political science and
English writing major, also has high -hopes
for this election.

“Interestingly enough, we have one of
the higher voter turnouts, comparatively to

schools our size,” Brown said.

Citing otherschool newspapers’ coverage
of student-government elections, Brown
listed Temple University (8 percent voter
turnout), Penn State (18 percent voter turn-
out), Westvirginia (9 Percent voter turnout)
and the University of Delaware (12 percent
voter turnout) as examples.

Brown also believes that SGB cannot
attribute the 24 percent vote to a lack of
effort by the Board. Brown explained that

SGB interacts with more than 450 student_
' groups on campus, and the candidates meet

with groups and individuals often. Since all
Board members are required to be liaisons
to speciﬁc student groups, Board members
keep in contact with them depending on how
often they request money.

Brown said students who are more in-
volved on campus are more likely to vote be-
cause the issues discussed by the candidates
are more likely to affect them. She blames
low voter turnout on students simply not
being well-informed.

This year, Brown is taking action to pre-
vent low voter turnout by taking advantage
of social media sites, such as Twitter and
Facebook. Candidates are encouraged to

create their own Facebook pagesto inform V

there is also a voter guide on SGB’s website

the candidates.

“The candidates are getting a lot better
at networking and getting their message
out,” Brown said. 3

This year, Brown is also taking advan-
tage of the student-run radio station at Pitt,

An online voting system would be
2 more efficient and accessible

Tiemoko Ballo
Columnist

If you were one of the many Ameri-
cans that stood out in the cold last
Tuesday waiting to vote, enduring
long lines and an overly laborious
process, it may have occurred to
you that there should be an easier
way to get your opinion counted.
Why stand in line to press afew
buttons on an electronic voting
machine or ﬁll out a paper ballot
when you have an internet-con-
nected smartphone in your jacket
pocket? We should be allowed to
cast our vote online. Most of us
already use the internet for paying
bills and online banking, and we
do so safely and securely. We live
in the information age; there’s no
reason we should have to wait in
line when the technology is there
to allow us to vote online.
Internet voting has a plethora
of potential beneﬁts. The ﬁrst
and perhaps most important is
increased voter turnout, both
domestically and overseas. Voter
turnout was only about 57 per-
cent in the 2008 election and the
New York Post has found that

current estimates for 2012 are
signiﬁcantly lower. Internet vot-
ing, because of the convenience
and ease of casting a vote from
the comfort of your own home, is
likely to drastically increase turn-
out. This could be especially true
for youth, who have traditionally
been apathetic about voting, and
Americans who are abroad or un-
able to travel to a polling station.
Though it’s difficult to quantify a
national increase projection, when
Arizona’s Democratic Party prima-
ry utilized internet voting in 2008,
the Dayton Daily News reported a
turnout increase from 238,942 to
456,626 —- 91 percent higher than
the previous year.

A second important advantage
is cost reduction. Currently, we
must set up thousands of poll-
ing stations nationwide and hire
personnel to run them. While
electronic voting machines have
increased in popularity, many
counties still rely on costly printed
ballots. This is expensive —— some
sources estimate a cost of $4 per
vote — and creates massive paper
waste. We can already ﬁle tax re-
turns online. Voting should have

a paperless option, as well.

The third major advantage of
Internet voting is the potential
for increased result accuracy and
faster result calculation. Though

‘there is some disagreement on the

exact percentage, researchers at
the California Institute of Tech-
nology claimthat approximately
5 percent of votes are not counted

’ because of ballots that are incor-

rectly ﬁlled out or lost in the mail.
A secure and well-designed online
voting system has the potential
notonly to reduce the percentage
of uncounted votes, but to total
votes accurately and almost in-
stantly. V
While all of these benefit

sound great in theory, many peo-
ple are concerned —- and right-
fully so —— about the security of
online voting. Given that “hacktiv-
ist” groups are increasingly visible
in the media and that many on-
line voters would use insecure or
already compromised machines,
security presents the biggest
implementation challenge to an
online voting system. Creating a

secure system would require great care,
but it’s not an unrealistic ambition. Voting
securityf could be achievedwith three key
mechanisms: user authentication, infor-
mation integrity and vote conﬁdentiality.
A reliable user authentication method
is critical to online voting: It must be pos-
sible to accurately verify the identity of
eligible voters to ensure that only legitimate
votes are counted. The nation of Estonia,
which has used an online voting system»

 since 2005, accomplished this byassigning 
 a‘ ‘scannablen government ID with a PIN;to.’

ful, and 24.3 percent of those who voted
in their 2011 parliamentary elections did
so online, it maysnot be a workable model
for a nation as large as the U.S. But there
are alternatives. Each U.S. citizen could be

with strict security controls enforced by
both hardware and software mechanisms.
In addition, an online system would have to
be centralized and restricted — individual
states should not be allowed to run their
own non-standard internet voting systems.

‘I 'l‘hé'}3ﬁnal security factor is vote conﬁ-
dentiality: A person’s ballot must not be
intérciifpted or read en—route to submis-
sion, and there should be no way to trace
an individual ballot back to the voter. One
possible solution is to require a secure con-
nection method for online voting, encrypt-
ing all traffic to and from a federal voting

' Yes, online voting has an array of valid
security concerns and presents a large
amount of potential risk. But the beneﬁts of
a secure national internet voting system are
well worth the hassles of implementation.
Increased turnout, cost reduction, greater
counting accuracy and faster counting time
add up to a superior method of doing things
that could greatly beneﬁt our nation. It’s not
impossible or even unrealistic: In Canada,
80 cities have used internet voting for local
elections, the entire country of Estonia uses
it for national elections and the U.S. has
already successfully experimented with it
at the state level. If I can take a picture of a
check with my cell phoneand make a bank
deposit, there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able
to cast a vote online. I

Saturday marked the 93rd annual Veterans Day
Parade Downtown.

Locals paid their respects as they lined the street
to watch veterans from the U.S. Army, Marines, Navy,
Air Force and Coast Guard march in the parade.
Veterans from the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq
wars made appearances.

The parade honored those who have served the
United States and recognized veterans who risked
their lives in war.

Beef, beans and vegetables lrneldnto create the ultimate in cold-weatpher comfort food.

 

kinds taste better with different meats and
many people are picky as to what kinds of
beans they do and don’t like. For example,
pinto beans go best with chicken in my opin-
ion, but I’m sure others ﬁnd the combination
revolting.

A variety ofvegetables can be included in
chilis to give them a colorful crunch of ﬂavor.
Corn, tomato chunks, celery and peppers (of
either the hot or sweet variety) add depth in
both ﬂavor and texture that can turn a basic
chili into a much stronger recipe.

When all the other ingredients boil down
and mellow into each other’s collective
goodness, it’s the spices that really make
a pot of chili pop. I’ve discovered that the
perfect blend of spices to pair with ground
beef includes cumin, garlic, salt, pepper and

oregano. The other usual chili seasonings,
such as hot sauce, crushed peppers and of
course, chili powder, can be a delicious ad-
dition to any chili — adjusting the amount
used to balance the heat and ﬂavor with your
other ingredient selections. ' -

A word of caution: Balancing these ﬂa-
vors can be a tricky skill to master. Some
claim that chocolate and beer can be stirred
into chili to better meld the dish together
and simultaneously enhance each ingredi-
ent’s individual ﬂavor. Whether or not either
of these strategies works is in the eye of the
beholder.

Obviously, it takes a bit of experimen-
tation to truly understand the secrets of
chili — the end result being a deliciously
crafted pot. With a bit of practice, you can
determine what ingredients you like best
in your chili and work them together into
a wholesome meal that you can share with
your friends to warm their bellies during
those cold winter tailgates, especially in
periods of heartache. I

Megan Boyle
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s basketball team began its run”

in the National Invitation Tournament Season
Tip-Off with a resounding victory to advance
to the quarterﬁnals of the early-season com-
petition.

Having won their season opener against
Mount St. Mary’s last Friday in easy fashion,
the Panthers repeated the feat on Monday
night at the Petersen Events Center, pouncing
on the Fordham Rams for an 86-51 triumph.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said he was
pleased with his team’s performance, and he
noted how well the Panthers took care of the
ball.

“I’m excited by the way we played,” Dixon
said after the game. “Twenty-four assists, six
turnovers — that’s the thing that really stands
out. I thought we defended well.”

Fordham handled the opening tip-off, but
that was the only thing the Rams controlled.

Pitt scored the game’s ﬁrst seven points
with a dunk by freshman center Steven Adams,
as well as a 3—pointer and a layup by senior
point guard Tray Woodall.

The Panthers never relinquished that lead.

The strong start set the tone for the ﬁrst
half, as Pitt took a commanding 37-18 lead
over Fordham into the break. The star of the
half — and of the game — was Pitt forward
j.J. Moore, who scored 12 points in the game’s
opening 20 minutes off the bench and added
eight more points after the intermission.

Moore said he enjoys being an impact sub-

stitution for Coach Dixon.

“I deﬁnitely like my role coming off the
bench,” Moore said. “I feel like I give the team
a lot of energy. I think it’s helping us out very
muc .”

Dixon compared Moore to former Pitt
player Sam Young, saying that the growth in
the junior stems from a rise in conﬁdence.

“I think his conﬁdence is just soaring,”

Dixon said. “He’s really getting better and - .

taking pride in what he’s doing.”

Several other Panthers fed off Moore’s per-
formance, especially Woodall, who ﬁnished in
double digits for the second straight game with

16 points, and Adams, who tallied 13 points '

and ﬁve rebounds.
For the second straight game, Pitt scored
numerouseasy buckets on fast—break oppor-

tunities after a defensive stop. The Panthers ”

ﬁnished with a total of 28 points scored off
turnovers. ,

Woodall said that getting steals has been
a focus for the Pitt defense early this season.

“The guards want to get up and pressure a
little more, because you’ve got big guys inside
that can alter shots,” he said. “We just want to
make sure that we pressure the ball and try to
force more turnovers. We’re forcing a lot more
turnovers this year.”

Pitt won’t have long to celebrate its second
victory of the season. 1 .

Pitt rallies for two victories to earn Big East tournament bertl1~~

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Stqff Writer

Entering the weekend outside the top eight
of the Big East standings, two clutch wins
allowed the Pitt Volleyball team to climb
the conference rankings and sneak into the
season—ending Big East tournament.

After defeating Seton Hall Friday night
at home, the Panthers (17-13, 7-8 Big East)
learned that DePaul upset St. John’s, mean-
ing that a Pitt victory in its ﬁnal match of the
season at Villanova would clinch a tourna-
ment berth.

With this information, the Panthers
played their waypinto the Big East tournament
with a 3-1 win over the Wildcats on Sunday.

Pitt 3, Seton Hall 1

The Panthers defeated the Pirates (18-10,
6-9 Big East) at the Fitzgerald Field House

in four sets with scores of 25-13, 25-19, 25-27
and 25-17.

According to Pitt head coach Toby Rens,
the Panthers did a good j ob of adhering to the
game plan and staying focused throughout
the match.

“I was pleased with the overall effort,”
Rens said. “We were able to be the aggres-
sor from start to ﬁnish, and it was a good
team win.”

In the ﬁrst set, the Panthers jumped out
to a 9-2 lead thanks to three kills and two
blocks by outside hitter Monica Wignot. Pitt
remained in control of the set and was led
to the victory by Jessica Wynn’s ﬁve kills in
the ﬁrst frame. ' .

The Panthers battled to a 4-3 lead over
the Pirates in the second set and led for the
remainder of the game en route to a 25-19
win, capped with a kill by Wignot.

After Seton Hall kept the match alive in a
narrow third-set win, Pitt regained momen-

tum in the fourth set and led by as much as
10. The Panthers held off the Pirates’ attempt
at a comeback and earned the overall match
victory with a kill by senior Alex Phillips.

Pitt recorded a season-high 96 digs in the
crucial triumph, with senior libero Margy
Acton leading the way with a season-best 31.

“Our passers kept us in system and we
scored a lot of points in defensive transi-
tion,” Rens said. “96 digs in four sets is a
phenomenal number.”

Offensively, Wynn, Wignot, Mechael
Guess and Alexa Campbell all contributed
double-digit kills for the Panthers.

Campbell credited much of the offense’s
success to the play of setters Lindsey Zitzke
and Jennajacobson.

“Our setters did a good job of distributing
the ball and getting the hitters a lot of one-
on-one matchups,” Campbell said. “Every
hitter made a presence, and that was a huge
part of the win.”

Pitt 3, Villanova 1

Knowing a win would clinch a top—eight
spot in the Big East standings and the confer-
ence tournament berth that comes with it~‘,r_
the Panthers once again used their offensive
abilities to gain a victory as they defeated the
Wildcats (11-19, 5-10) on the road Sunday
afternoon in four sets with scores of 23-25,
25-19, 25-20 and 25-19.

Acton believed that the key to the win was,
remaining focused, despite the implications’
of the match.

“We needed to re-focus on this match
after beating Seton Hall,” Acton said. “We
didn’t want to take the game lightly, but we
also did not want to approach the contest
too wound up.” 

Rens agreed, noting that Villanova always
presents a challenge.

Sophomore guard John Johnson

latest to announce transfer

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team won on Monday
night against Fordham. But earlier in the day,
the Panthers learned that they were losing a
member of their roster.

Sophomore guard Johnjohnson informed
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon of his decision to
transfer prior to the Panthers’ 86-51 victory over
the Rams, andJohnson didn’t dress for the game.

After the easy victory, Dixon conﬁrmed the
rumors that Johnson would be transferring,
saying that the guard hasn’t decided where his
next destination will be.

“We wish him the best,” Dixon said
of Johnson. “We’re really just trying to
help him ﬁnd the best place for him.”
With his transfer,Johnson becomes the third Pitt
men’s basketball player in the past two years to

leave the University, after Khem Birch and Isaiah
Epps departed last season.

Johnson averaged 4.2 points and 1.2 assists
in about 14 minutes per game last season, but he
ﬁgured to receive less playing time this season
with Pitt’s solid depth at both guard positions,
led by point guards Tray Woodall and James
Robinson and shooting guards Trey Zeigler and
Cameron Wright.

Johnson didn’t play at all in Pitt’s season
opener against Mount St. Mary’s last Friday.

Woodall said that it’s not uncommon for
some players to struggle ﬁtting in with the Pan-
thers’ men’s basketballprograrn.

“I always knew that Pitt’s not really for ev-
erybody,” Woodall said afterthe Fordham game
when asked aboutjohnson. “Some guys like it
here, but just don’t feel comfortablehere as
the year goes on. But honestly, Pitt’s just not
for everybody.” ﬁ

“Villanova is a completely different team
from Seton Hall,” Rens said. “They are scrap-
py and mix up the tempo. We needed to come
ready to play, and I was pleased with our
game—plan execution.”

The Wildcats began the contest with a 5-0
lead, and even after the Panthers responded
to level the score, Villanova earned the ﬁrst-
set win.

The second set was highly contested early
on, and the two teams traded points until the
score was 10-10. But the Panthers dominated
the remainder of the set and never trailed
again after tying the match.

With the score even at 17 in the impor-

tant third set, two kills and two blocks by
Seniorjasmine Dittrich propelled Pitt on a
set—ending 8-3 run to take a lead that it would
never relinquish.

Sensing that they were one set away from
clinching a conference tournament berth
that appeared unlikely before the weekend
started, the Panthers dominated the ﬁnal
set to seal the match victory in the regular-
season ﬁnale.

Pitt will begin postseason play Friday,
Nov. 16, facing tournament host Marquette
at 6 p.m. The Panthers will be hoping to avoid
their fourth consecutive ﬁrst—round exit at
the Big East tournament. I
