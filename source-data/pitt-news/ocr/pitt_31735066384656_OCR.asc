Student Union Renovations Planned

By DAVE KIRSHNER
Pitt News Staff Writer
Schenley Hall will undergo
extensive renovation next fall as
part of a continuing conversion
from an old hotel to a modern

T student union.

Preliminary measurements
should be completed by the end of
April, while a comprehensive study
of the building is scheduled for
next month. .

According to Student Union
manager, Terrence E. Milani, the
architectural plans and funding
allocation will be worked out during
the summer.

“We will begin to work on the

Iiuiesign and layout and then plan the

iynionization of Graduate Employees Discussed

phases of the project,” Milani
explained.

The renovation, which is believ-
ed to be one of the largest student
union conversion projects in the
country, will gradually be imple-
mented over the next two to three
years.

Milani said the problems of
moving people in and out of the
facility and updating the first-ﬂoor

area would probably receive initial

attention.

“We have all kinds of alterna-
tives,” he said, “but we just don’t
know what we can do yet.”

Input into the program is coming
from all segments of the Univer-
sity.

Advisers and officers from 92
student organizations housed in the
Union will be consulted as well as
the University's various adminis-
trative offices. ,

Student‘ activities director
Williard “Bud” Heaps recently

‘started evaluation of the possible

funding alternatives. He said the
University is committed to the
project, but no conclusive alloca-
tion decision will be reached until
late this summer.

Cost considerations and the fact
that the building has to stay in
operation prohibited starting from
scratch, according to Milani.

“We’re not knocking down
Schenley Hall,” he said. i “The
building has the potential to
support the services we need.

“But we’ve got a hotel, not a
student union,” Milani continued.
“There exists essentially the same

At FAS-GSO Meeting

services as the hotel had when
there was one person per room.
Now we have groups in each room;

the same services can’t hope to

handle them.”

Among the possible improve-
ments mentioned were the con-
struction of a large ballroom facility
for better programming, increased
recreational areas and the develop-
ment of current services.

The most recent. push for
renovation began nearlygfive years
ago. Various proposals’.-‘ii_i“I;aIts'e.sbeen
offered over that period and some
adjustmentsliave been made. This
project, however, marks the first
attempt at a mass reconditioning.

Milani said a similar project was
undertaken at one of the major
universities in Texas, but on a
smaller scale. '

He added that one of the
assumptions during the renovation
will be that the student union
concept “extends beyond the walls
of the building.”

Milani indicated that some
programs might utilize existing
facilities such as Trees Hall and the
David Lawrence auditorium.

 

The Cathedral lawn serves as a good spot to rest and catch some entertainment. This juggler could have his
work cut out of him this week as students will most likely flock there between final exams.

Paralyzed Pitt Gymnas

Asks For New Trial -

By SUE‘ McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Thomas Cardamone Jr., a former Pitt gymnast paralyzed from the
neck down after he fell from exercise rings during practice six years ago,
is continuing his court case to prove negligence on the part of the
University.

Cardamone suffered a setback in January when a jury handed down a
10-2 decision in favor of Pitt. The plaintiffs, attorney, I_.ouis R. Tamasi Jr.
has challenged the jury’sdecision,requesting a new trial on the grounds
the jury was “tainted” by allegedly improper conduct of two jurors.

Cardamone, 26, of Bethel Park, suffer irreparable spinal damage
resulting in the loss of the use of his arms and legs after attempting
a maneuveron the-rings called a “dislocate.” Thomas Cardamone Sr.
charges that the University was guilty of negligence on several counts.

“My son was a novice, ‘needing more help than the other boys on the
team who had a lot of experience in high school,” the elder Cardamone
said. “Tommy was working out with the team in his junior year and
plannning to participate in his senior year.”

Cardamone said his son had no spotter at that -practice and there was
insufficientlmatting around the apparatus. 1

The move Cardamone was attempting was a transitional move from
one trick to another, according to Elliot Sanft, a member of the Pitt
gynmastics team at that time who also witnessed the accident. Sanft,
who now operates a gymnastics school in Shadyside, said the move was

one in which the gymnast hangs from the rings and moves into an
upside down position from which he bends at the waist to kick up to
ﬁnally pull himself up from the bottom. Sanft explained that Cardamone

‘ was attempting to perform the maneuver with no pause and, because his

arms were not positioned correctly (bent, rather than being straight),
the momentum of his body forced him to be “ripped” off the rings,
on his head.

In the months following the mishap, the University signed an
agreement with the Cardamone family to pay up to $2,000 per month for
medical expenses. However, these payments ceased with the January
verdict of the jury.

Sanft told how he recently contacted Chancellor Posvar’s office in an
attempt to determine the feasibility of setting ‘up some type of fund for
the “care of Tom Cardamone.” Sanft quoted a Pitt ofﬁcial as saying
“the University has been cleared of any negligence in the Cardamone
case so we have no part in the matter anymore.” ‘

The cost of Cardamone’s medical care has risen approximately
$10,000 since the time of the accident in 1972.

The Faculty of Arts and Science Graduate
Student Organization Friday unanimously
adopted a proposal to investigate ‘the
possibility of unionizing Pitt’s graduate
employees.

The organization scheduled a workshop
with members of the Union of Graduate
Employers May 12 and ordered an
inyestigation of existing graduate employee
unions at the University of Michigan and the
University of Wisconsin.

Supporters of the proposal argued the
 , inistration was not sufficiently concerned
with graduate employees’ working conditions
and new methods were needed to gain
concessions from FAS. ‘

source of action on our problems, we should
seek other means to affect working conditions,
namely collective bargaining.”

Gale McGloin, anthropology graduate
student and undergraduate adviser, said the
FAS Council could deal with allegedly poor
working conditions for graduate employees
but refuses to face the problem because it has
different interests. —

“It’s not a question that the FAS ‘can’t deal ‘

with the problems,” McGloin said, “but they
won’t deal with them.”

Council meeting as to whether teaching
assistants should receive credit for classes

ByJIMMORRlSON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitts 1977-78 academic year,
unlike last year, will not be
remembered for any ‘sensational
events. There were no tragic
explosions, no national champion-
ships, no earth-shaking happen-
ings. It was a year long on
controversies and resignations,
short on appropriations and
energy. In short, it was a year of
politics and economics.

Certainly, the most lingering
story of the year was the budget

 

campus “teach-in” and a student
rally with some 3,000 “vocal but
orderly” participants from Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
trying to inﬂuence legislators to act
promptly.

The State Legislature ﬁnally
came through with Pitt’s “non-
preferred” $62 million Dec. 8, and
things began to return to normal.
But not before enough damage had
been done to prompt University
trustees to raise tuition. On
Valentine’s Day, the trustees
announced a $3-per-credit-hour,

Resignations made news during fall term. Fr. Ivan Dornic (left) resigned his
teaching position, charging University officials with prejudice in the hiring of
teachers in the Slavic department. Black Studies chairman Curtiss Porter also
resigned, claiming the growth of his department was being restricted by the
same officials.

crisis. Because of Harrisburg’s
political shenanigans, Pitt spent
most of the fall term without state
funding and was forced to borrow
to cover operating expenses. The
administration reported losing as
much as $2,500 a day because of
“loss of income, problem of cash
ﬂow and cost of borrowing.”

The crisis prompted an on-

$50-per-term raise. (Some stu-
dents will also pay higher housing
fees next year).

No sooner had the dust from this
crisis settled than the University
was gearing for another one.
Governor Shapp’s budget for next
year does not include an increase
for Pitt, so University ofﬁcials
spent some of the winter term in

The uncertainty of employees’
legal status has prevented unioni-
zation in the past. Although
Pennsylvania Act 195 gives state
employees the right to organize, the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board and state courts never
declared until recently that teaching
assistants, graduate research as-

sistants and teaching fellows were
deﬁned as employees under the act.
The Pitt Professional Union and
the Union of Graduate Employees,
American Federation of Teachers
Local 3414, ﬁled a suit with the

graduate students were Pitt em-
ployees or merely Pitt students.

Harrisburg trying to change that.

Meanwhile, another crisis was
brewing. As the nation-wide coal
strike lingered on, the effects
began to be felt close to home. By
February, it became apparent that
conservation measures would be
necessary. With authorization by
the state Public Utility Commis-
sion, Duquesne Light ordered a
25-percent cutback to its largest
users. Pitt achieved the mandatory
cutback by reducing lighting,
heating and operating hours mostly
on the lower campus. The cutback
continued until after the strike’s
settlement in March.

Another strike made——and con-
tinues to make—news at Pitt. In
mid-February, union employees
walked out of Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC),
protesting current wages, beneﬁts
and negotiation procedures at the
University-administered institu-
tion. Just last week, as the strike
reached its 53rd day, strike
supporters physically restrained
Chancellor Posvar, claiming
patient care at WPIC has deterior-
ated and pressing the Chancellor to
end the walkout.

Besides strikes, the past year has
seen its share of controversies,
some culminating in resignations,

pacts and ‘ ‘gentleman’ s agree-
ments. ” ‘
Prof. Paul Nyden, a big

newsmaker last year, reportedly
accepted a tidy sum of money from
the University for dropping his
court suit that alleged discrimina-
tion on the administration’s part.
Although the Pittsburgh Press
mentioned $50,000 as the settle-
ment ﬁgure, neither Nyden nor Pitt

A state court recently solved an
appeal on the case, ruling graduate
students working as teaching
assistants, research assistants and
research fellows were employees.
The Union of Graduate Employees
must now reﬁle the case with the

Board to ﬁnd whether graduate
employees are covered by Act 195.

If the board rules that the act

were free to conﬁrm the exact
amount.

Another long, legal battle was
settled this year, this one involving
former Pitt professor Sharon
Johnson who alleged sexual dis-
crimination. Johnson lost a court
decision last summer and ended
her ﬁve-year legal case by entering
a pact, promising not to appeal the
court-approved denial of her tenure
in exchange for Pitt’s pledge not to
ﬁle a countersuit for legal fees.
Johnson has since moved on to
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute of
New York.

In October, Father Ivan Dornic of
the‘ Slavic department also accused
the University of discrimination
and resigned as instructor. Dornic

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

G80 Unionization

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Graduate Student
Organization’s proposal to investigate other graduate employees’
unions in the nation is a new step toward the establishment of a

graduate employees’ union here.

Teaching assistants, graduate research assistants and teaching
fellows show strong support for unionization. Although there were
two abstentions during the GSO’s recent vote on the proposal, no
one at the meeting voiced strong opposition to the proposal. Past
mock elections showed,that voting graduate employees were over-
whelmingly in favor of the right to bargain collectively.

This support seems to grow from dissatisfaction among ‘graduate
students, who find the University turning a deaf ear to their

requests for better working conditions.

Pro—unionists cite FAS

Graduate Counr‘il’s inclination toward granting only one credit for
a course all teaching assistants and teaching fellows must take next

year as proof of the administration’s insensitivity.

In this case,

graduate employees argue they deserve three credits since they must
spend two hours a week in the class. Two credits seem reasonable.

The graduate employees say they are not primarily concerned
with more money, but want changes (such as the granting of the
credits,) which can be instituted without large fund outlays. Still,
administrators seem unwilling to fulfill graduate employees’
demands, and TA’s and TF’s now seem determined to turn to

collective bargaining to get them.

Unionization seems to be the wrong answer to the problem. The
conflicts inherent in employer-union employee relationships cause
tension not worth the‘ possible gains from collective bargaining.
Graduate employees and administrators, in a life-and-death
struggle similar to the battle between Western Psych union mem-
bers and Pitt, would be totally counter-productive.

What Pitt needs least is another union, but the administration
apparently gives graduate employees no choice but to form one. If
the University wants to avoid estabishment of the union, they
should begin to listenito the graduate students who play a vital role
in the Univeristy. Administrators who are callous toward graduate
employees can only lead to deteriorating relations and much strife.

living at Carlow this year from Pitt,
we ﬁnd it impossible to accept the
term “several” as applicable.

The ﬁfth paragraph states that we
may use ‘ ‘either Pitt or Carlow meal
plans. ’ ’ This is either badly phrased
or poorly researched, since we must
buy the Pitt meal plans. We may,

however, use our Pitt meal ticket to
eat at Carlow, ’

More severe reporting errors
also occur. Male visitors are not
allowed in our rooms during the
week at all. Male guest visitation
hours are from nine p.m. to two
a.m. on Friday, two p.m. to two

a.m. on Saturday, and two p.m. to i

nine p.m. on Sunday.

It is not true that living at Carlow
is a “temporary arrangement with
students moving to the campus as
soon as possible.” We were given
two-term contracts, just like
anyone who resides in Pitt’s other
dormitory facilities.

We felt that it was necessary to
bring these discrepancies to your

attention for two reasons. First of
all, when there is an article in the
newspaper, accuracy is a must.
The second reason is that the
inaccuracy of this article came at a
most inconvenient time since there

V)

are many girls who are trying to '

decide whether to room at Carlow or
not. They should not be misled by a
newspaper article when trying to
make such a decision.

Perhaps an article listing the pros
and cons of living at Carlow College
when you are a Pitt student is in
order. We will try to cooperate in
order to provide an accurate picture
of the situation here.

Richard Nixon’s Election Final Legacyof 1968

By R. DAVID TIVE

Editor’s Note: This is the fifth and
last in a series on the events of 1968,
their impact at that time, and their
repercussions on A merica today.

Thus far in this series we have
examined four dramatic events of
1968: the withdrawal of Lyndon
Johnson from the Presidential race,
the assassination of Martin Luther
King, the assassination of Robert
Kennedy and the police riot at the
Democratic National Convention in
Chicago. All that took place in just
six months.

It had been a year of constant
acceleration. Things started rather

quietly, but with a sham break from

American political tradition when
Gene McCarthy challenged Presi-
dent Johnson and found early
success. The year’s level of
intensity increased with the killing
of King and soared with the murder
of Kennedy, both instances of
individual violence against major
political and social leaders.

The climax ‘came in Chicago.
Again the level was increased with
the outbreak of mass, organized
violence.

It is no surprise then that three
months after Chicago, when
American voters chose a President,
they chose someone who represent-
ed solidity, someone most people
felt they knew and could predict
‘what he would do. They chose an

anchor to provide some stability in a
time of seemingly insurmountable
troubles. They chose Richard
Nixon.
In that light, the election ot

Nixon seems almost logical. In fact,
it is the 0IllY way in which the

THOUGHTS AND
REFLECTIONS

election of Nixon seems even the
slightest bit logical. To people
familiar with N ixon’s past record, it
could only be assumed that he
would calm the troubled times,
and would cause ‘no new surprises.

Nixon had longevity. He had been
on the national political scene for 20
years. Nixon was an anti-commu-
nist. He had ﬁrst gained national
political attention through his
communist witch hunt undertaken
as an offshoot of Joe McCarthy's
hearings. Nixon stood for govem-
mental non interference in most
aspects of our life, especially the
economy. .

He had campaigned actively
against the economic innovations of
the Johnson administration. Nixon
was predictable. He had served as
Vice-President for eight years
under Dwight Eisenhower, the most
predictable of 20th-century Ameri-
can Presidents..

There can be little doubt that this
is what the American people
wanted. If they had wanted
something else they would have
chosen Hubert Humphrey. He was

not a symbol of stability.

Humphrey had always been an
advocate of social change. He was
continually championing the rights
of the underprivileged, even at the
expense of those already well
established in society. He was
irrevocably tied to the Vietnam
War, which was becoming the
major source of national instability.
He had almost single-handedly
disrupted the Democratic National
Convention in Philadelphis in 1948,
and played a major role in the
disruptions in Chicago earlier that
year.

Clearly, the election of Nixon was
the direct result of all that had
happened that year. The irony is
that what the voters got’ was the
complete antithesis of what they
wanted, or thought they were
getting. .

After ﬁve and a half years of
Richard ‘Nixon’s “stability,” the
American people got rid of him, and
got rid of him in a manner
unprecedented in our history. His
‘ ‘stability’ ’ put this country through
some changes that while not as
intense or as wrenching as those of
1968, still put strains on us as a
people and as a nation.

The joke was on us. Nixon’s~

anti-commmunism surfaced as
detente with the Russians and the
opening of relations with our
dreaded enemies, the Chinese. His
noninterference in the economy
became the imposition of wage and

price controls. His predictability

emerged through a series of
seemingly irrational acts, such as
the Watergate break-in, and
through temper tantrums such as
his shoving of press secretary Ron
Ziegler in public and calling

anti-war protestors names. (.. .
Finally the time came Wheﬁqg

Nixon’s behavior was so far out of
line with what we had expected and
what we were willing to stand from a
President that it became necessary
to remove him. That process, and
its aftermath, became as serious a
national trauma as the events of
1968.

Richard Nixon was the legacy of
1968. He was not, however, the only
legacy of that difﬁcult year. This
series has tried to explain the main

impact on our politics,_ our society
and our image of ourselves is
something that will be with us for a
long time.

The year 1968 did reveal a number
of serious flaws in our nation. It also
caused a ‘few more. Unfortunately,
there is no reason to believe that any
of them have been relieved.

One thing that should be pointed
out, however, is that we did come
through that crucible year with
most of our societal inﬁfitutions

Letters

wApology to StudentsRejected from Show

I

1.
Li

I would like to take this
opportunity to reply to the letter of
Monday’s edition concerning pro-
gramming, and what was labeled a
“ﬁasco.” As chairman of Student
Government lectures, l'would like
to offer my profound apologiesto
all those students who were unable

to obtain seats for what I consider,

one of our ﬁnest programs. It was,
however, unfortunately part of the
programming process that things
ended up the way they did.

First, it was indeed stated in the
contract that the aisles must be
clear for Kreskin to do his show, as
those who watched him retrieve his
check know. His manager was
dogging me every step of the way
to make sure that this was honored;
otherwise, Kreskin would not have
performed.

Secondly, there are ﬁre laws and
other’ state and municipal ordi-
nances prohibiting packing in
audiences like sardines. David
Lawrence was our choice because it
is the biggest facility the University
makes available to us, and all the

.. others, such as Syria Mosque, were
booked.

Thirdly, to be frank, the process
of programming depends much
upon the estimation of audiences
and it ‘is evident our estimation was
much too low (although it was in

' accord with similar programs held
in Lawrence). Still, there is no
guarantee that the booking of two
performances would attract enough

of an audience to justify the
necessary streamlining of what is
considered to be a superb
performance.

Speaker presentations are not
the kinds of things that has
warranted this condition in the
past. Ticket distribution, apart
from the hassle it would have
caused those who wanted to attend,
is no solution; someone always

wants in without a ticket because
lectures are not the kind of thing
you plan in advance to attend.

The next step with tickets would
be to charge for them. Do you,
already paying an activities fee,
want that? Finally, paying an
activities fee does indeed give you
that right to see the show.

But it has to be exercised with
some thought. In other words, why
wait until the last minute to bop on
over? People started ﬁlling up the

hall at 7:30 p.m.

This ‘was one of the last
programs presented by Student
Government programming. I am
amazed students even know we
exist. Our name has been in print
only once in a story, which covered
a speaker, besides the advertise-
ments we bought with student
activities money. The lack of
~mention or acknowledgement of
our efforts has been, in my opinion,
one of the reasons for the evolution
of all student programming into an
organization directly run by stu-
dent activities.

If any of you are continuing
students who did not like the way
programming has been handled,
please, please, don’t just complain.
Become involved in the new
program council and change things
as a chairperson.

doesn’t let go. The most winning
child is sometimes the one who
hangs back a little. “Punch and
Judy, or A Fall in the Family,” will
shyly present itself on Saturday and
Sunday at 2 p.m. in“ the'Studio
Theater. Just because it hasn’t
jumped into your lap doesn’t mean
you should ignore it.

The play and the company are the
brain children of Gillette Elvgren,
professor of theater arts. The
company, called Childsplay, is
composed mostly of Pitt students
who go around to elementary
schools to perform a play. Being
fond of kids and just as fond of the
theater, I went to a rehearsal. I
found, as the villain says,
“Confusion in profusion,” but

I kept coming back. The play

Mediterranean and Atwood.

The former was an excellent
blend of mixed lettuce, tomatoes,
artichoke hearts, parsley, celery
and scallions. Atwoood was a
spinach-based salad rather over-
whelmed by chick peas. It also
contained tomatoes, parsley and
scallions.

Bread or rolls are included with »

either an order of soup or salad.
You can help yourself to red onions,
parmesan cheese, black olives,
crotons and freshly group pepper at
a side table.

The salad dressings are home-
made; tested were a yogurt—based
dressing fragrant with herbs.

No alchololic beverages are
served, but there is a list of fruit
juices, perrier water, coffee or tea.
Dessert is either carob-baded fudge
or frozen yogurt in strawberry,
vanilla or half and half.

The decor of The Salad Co. is
light, airy and comfortable. Most of
the walls are whitewashed brick,
with one wall festooned with a motif
of lettuce and a huge sketch of
asparagus. The tables are
reminsicent of sparkling summer
lawn furniture, and the chairs have
seats made of cheerful green and
white checked gingha.

For a refreshing change of pace,
check out The Salad Co. It’s a very
pleasant place and the salads are
great. ‘

Michae|‘FranksHas a Hit on His Hands

By CINDIJEVANGELISTA

Pitt News Staff Writer

When Michael Franks released
“Popsicle Toes” a few years ago,
everyone knew he’d either hit it big
or ﬂop—nothing in between. As it
turned out, he ﬂipped the charts
and later produced even better
albums, proving that jazz can hit it
big even in a world dominated by

' rock ’n’ roll or disco. His new

release, “Burchﬁeld Nines,” has

_ yet to prove itself.

" The overall sound of the album is

good but considering the per-
former, it could be a lot better.
Unlike his previous recordings, this
one tends to drag. Ifyou’re a person
who loves to fall asleep to music,
then you’ll probably love “Burch-
ﬁeld Nines.”

Side one holds itself together
through Franks’s voice, which
seems to ﬂoat through all the lyrics,
giving the songs a nice, light, airy
feeling. Music-wise, there’s a lot of
ﬁne musicians behind Franks, but
innovators they’re not. 

In the title song, Oscar Bra-
shear’s trumpet sounds like any
trumpet in any jazz number, except
that his makes you feel like it’s that
slow tired day after a New Year's
Eve party. From the sounds of the
tones, side one could be one big
song instead of four different ones.

Side two is a slightly different
story. At least you can tell which is
side one and which is side two.
There’s a lot more work in the
instrumental department that gives

_thealbu/mppsome of that good old

Michael Franks jazz. The mixing
and engineering is better, too-
especially in “Dear Little Nightin-
gale” which features Franks,
Franks and Franks in a vocal
collage. His voices can release the
loudest emotion even when he’s
whispering, and it’s this quality that
puts the icing on the cake (even a
stale one).

The best cut is “Vivaldi’s Song"’
where John Tropea, on lead
acoustic guitar, strums a lyrical trill
with Franks sweeping the chords

on an acoustic rhythm guitar.
Adding to that is Bud Shank who
takes a solo with the ﬂute and makes
the whole song a pleasure to
listening to. The rest of the cuts are
all the same and just not up ‘:0 par
with Frank’s previous works. But
they’re still nice to listen to.

Maybe they’re even too nic 3. All
the songs from side one to two. re so
nice that they don’t go anyw iere.
They just hang there in the ai 7. At
this point, there’s no telling where
Michael Franks will go. a

‘Q2:

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Sugar Time
ABC

Public television ran a witty little
mini-series last year called -“The
Rock Follies,” which dealt with an
all-female rock band. Never one to
let an idea slide, ABC Ameri-
canized that concept and renovated
it into a singing “Charlie’s
Angels” (ironically, Cheryl Ladd

‘ was chosen as Farrah Fawcett-Ma-

jors’ successor by her test for a role
in “Sugar Time.”).

Anyway, the main character here
is Max, played by Barbie Benton.
Benton is the former girlfriend of
Hugh Hefner, and her sole acting
credits come from a year on “Hee
Haw.” It is fair to say, however,
that Benton’s talents were not
wasted on “Hee Haw” because she
has none.

Plotwise, “Sugar Time” makes
“Charlie’s Angels” seem like
Shakespeare’s first folio.

— The Harvey Korman Show

ABC

Playing second banana to Carol
Burnett, or a character role in a
Mel Brooks film is simply one of
the funniest actors in the world. In

his own show, Korman is mediocre.

BARBIE BENTON
(stars in “Sugar Time”)

at best. It’s not a too-much-of-a-
good-thing instance Korman does
not work well in a situation
comedy. 1

Here, he plays Harvey Kava-
naugh, an egocentric actor whose
daughter Maggie has moved in
with a guy named Stuart whom

 Third Season Te|evision——Discippointing

Harvey can’t stand. That’s a
capsule description of the show and
also leaks out what any possible
plots would be about.

Having Korman portray an actor
would supposedly provide a lot of
leeway—he could utilize his con-
siderable gift of mimicry, for
example. Unfortunately, this show

"i is done in by being tired, situation
comedy. L

And this may be a blessing in
disguise. Maybe they’ll ressurect
Korman with a variety show in
which he can do the things he does
best.

America Tonight
Syndicated

“America Tonight” is merely
“Fernwood Tonight,” that Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman” (which
is now “Forever Fernwood”)
spin-off that satirizes talk shows on
a much broader scale.

“America Tonight” has changed
its locale from F ernwood, Ohio, to a
Los Angeles suburb, but that’s the
only difference. Martin Mull is
back as host Barth Gimble.
Gimble’s gimmick is to get the
most tasteless acts available for
the show, and he rivals “The Gong
Show” for the lineup he brings out.

Final Notes on QB’s, Coaches and (Of Course) Stetler,

Aside to Rick Trocano: Do not be discouraged by the

The overseas opportunity presented a problem at Pitt, which

implication made here recently that your ability to throw may had t0 decide Whether the Publicity f1'0m the t1'iD t0 J 319311

not be compatible with Pitt’s ability to win football games.
The last athlete criticized in this space read the article, was
demoted from the starting team as the column suggested,
and leaped from the bench to lead the basketball team to win
against Maryland, Villanova and Duquesne. And the only
reason Pete Strickland may not start for the Panthers next
season is his record as an inspiration off the bench...
‘Continued aside to Rick Trocano: The above does not
mean your spot atop the depth chart is secure; in fact, if you
spend any of your free time doing anything other than
throwing footballs long distances at small targets, your’re
crazy...
(‘To those who believe (correctly) that quarterback is where
Jackie Sherrill’s biggest headache is to be found: Lindsay
Delaney threw three touchdown passes to Gordon Jones in a

scrimmage the other day; Rick Trocano was recruited as a '

passing quarterback, and it is unfair to judge a quarterback
on.h1s freshman year, especially one as odd as Trocano’s; and
neither Delaney nor Trocano probably is as bad as pessimists
fear...

. ‘The Pitt football team will not travel to Tokyo next season;
instead, the Panthers will trample Tulane at the Superdome.

would compensate for the possible loss of ppbl_icity£sultmg

 

from late game’s weakening effect on Pitt’s bowl chances.
This was a big decision, since publicity is the reason Pitt plays
football...

Look for Pitt’s starting running backs next season to be
Fred Jacobs and a large freshman...

If you’re looking for former Pitt runner Bob Hightower,
forget Hawaii. Hightower transferred from Hawaii to Utah
recently and is said to be hoping he can be eligible in
September...

Joe Paterno will accept the coaching job with the New

York Giants sometime during the next three years, and the
head Nit wants a national championship before he leaves
State College more than he’s like to see Pitt Stadium fall into
the Monongahela River...

Rampant Civic Arena speculation is that the Penguins will
change their colors to black and gold before next season and
that there will also be a name change probably to
“Hornets”.

That the Penguins almost made the playoffs while the
Pirates almost certainly will not is a telling case for the
restructuring of the hockey and baseball playoff systems...

Len Barcalow of the Pitt hockey club is in St. Francis
Hospital in Bloomfield, room 6614. Barcalow, Pitt’s most
dedicated coach, considered leaving his job at North Park so
that he might spend more time with his hockey team even
though he receives no pay or benefits at Pitt...

If Pitt adds more seats to the Field House, as should and
will probably be done, and the parking situation atop the hill
thereby worsens, as it almost certainly will, attendance at
Panther home games could become a two-day road trip for
Pitt fans...

It has been suggested by several persons that Kathy
Stetler is my dream girl; that is true, but every time I dream
about her she’s wearing a Randy Newman T-shirt...

Pantherettes Come Back To Eam Split

Mﬁrilae three-set limit. .

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staffwriter _
The Pitt women’s tennis team

1"‘ earned a split for its weekend work
“ Saturday by defeating Marshall

University, 8-1, after bowing to
Miami (Ohio), 5-4, Friday.

In the opening match against
Miami, the Pantherettes split the
six singles matches (winning the
first three), but were thwarted in
an effort to notch their second
victory of the season by dropping
two of three doubles matches’. :1‘

Top singles ﬁa2yer,‘M:€aria Paris,
coming off a disappointing perfor-
mance against Penn State, staked

Pitt to ‘an. earlyileiad byipiastering ' "

Sue Wartner ina match" that went
_ Paris is
suffering from , a chronic back
ailment and must undergo heat
treatments prior to each match.

“Maria played very well in the
opening match,” said assistant
coach Irma Pytka. “Her back has

been bothering her and has been
hampering her serve and over-
heads. She has really been playing
with a lot of pain.”

Janet DeCostro extended the
Pantherette margin by beating
Diane Johnson in another three-set
match. Johnson gave DeCostro
trouble throughout the second and
third sets after getting blanked in
the ﬁrst.

“Diane is a tall girl (6-1), and she

moved real well and covered a lot of
ground,” said Pytka. ,

Pam Bachman continued to play
the best tennis on the team,
beating Sally Schaberg. According
to Pytka, Bachmanis the Panther-
ette who has come closest to
playing up to her potential this
season.

The Pantherettes lost four of the
final five matches, and only the
first doubles team of Paris-

DeCostro was able to win. Duri" g
the two seasons the Pantherette
pair have been together, they have
lost only one match, that being the
one to Penn State last weekend.

“I felt that we had a real good
chance to’ win the match,” said
Pytka. “If we could have won the
second-doubles and fourth singles
matches, as I believe we could, it
would have turned the match
around.”

Pitt found Marshall an easier nut
to crack than Miami, blasting the
West Virginia university the
following day, as Janice Irwin was
the lone Pantherette to be
defeated, losing the fourth singles
match.

Paris and DeCostro won their
respective matches by an identical
score, 6-1, 6-2, to lead the
Pantherettes to a victory that was
not as close as’ the final score
indicated. ,

Marshall was unable to win a,

- Ditto Nancy Gordon, Dieffenbach’s

Pitt Netters Tired of Playing on ihird-Rate Tennis Courts

Tennis, anyone? _

At Pitt’s Trees Courts, anyone?

Anyone...? ,

That" tennis enthusiasts refuse to play at Trees
should come as no surprise to people who have seen
those seven blunders of the world up on the hill. The
nsequences of playing there are severe: 1) the risk
of injury on the slippery, perforated surface is
inevitable, and 2) most players have too much tennis
pride; the mere thought of setting foot and racquet
upon the cratered facilities could ruin a person’s
credibility for the rest of his Wilson-swinging life.

Those not afforded the luxury of choosing alter-
native courts, however, (Pitt’s tennis teams) have had
to serve and bear it.

“Those_ are the worst tennis courts I've ever seen,”
said Panther coach George Dieffenbach. “They’re in
deplorable condition——an embarrassment to the

University.”

1

Pantherette
ounterpart.

“Pitt has two good tennis teams,” Gordon said of
the men’s and women’s squads, “but the facilities are
terrible; they’re not even adequate. I can’t ask my
girls to play there any more——it’s not fair.”

The consensus of Gordon’s and Dieffenbach’s
players seems to agree with that. Opinions of Trees
range from “they’re the worst I’ve ever played on”
to “they’re the worst I’ve ever played on.”

And for good reason; the court conditions don’t
do much for one’s game. Concentration and skill
somehow fail to develop when, according to one Pitt
player, “you have to contend with three bad bounces

“per game’’ and when the biggest obstacle during a

match isn’t trying to return an overhead smash but
rather trying to avoid PennDot-sized potholes. Just
ask Maria Paris, whoalmost hurt herself during a '
Pantherette practice this year.

Equally frustrating are Tree’s surrounding com-
plements. Distractions and wind-blown dust from
the adjoining softball field, vandalism in the parking
‘lot (Dieffenbach returned to his car once to find the
windshield broken and the hubcaps missing) and
juvenile and drunken obscenities (kids throwing _
stones and “drunks yelling some beautiful comments
that can’t be repeated,” Gordon said) all contribute
to the uneriviable nositionﬂnf Pitt’s tennis tearni.

 

Outsiders, those unfamiliar with Pitt tennis and
the University’s high-class sports complex, are
treated to a good laugh when they discover that Pitt
would sponsor varsity matches on courts whose net-
work of cracks likens the Martian canal system and
whose nets look as if they belong on a ﬁshing tub
rather than tennis courts. A first-time observer of
Pitt tennis, watching the Panthers defeat Robert
Morris, 9-0, last Sunday, remarked, “Where do they
play their real matches?”

That, he later unbelievingly discovered, was a real
match—an honest-to-Wimbledon down-in-the-
record-books University of Pittsburgh tennis match.

Impressive. ‘

The time has come, Gordon and Dieffenbach say,
for athletic department action. Not that the time
hasn’t been here for years; Dieffenbach can’t
remember a day when the courts were ever in decent
shape.

_ University red tape.

“I came here in 1971 as a player,” he said. “The
courts were bad then and they haven’t changed. I
think they’ve been resurfaced once in the last seven
years.”

According to Gordon, Sandy Bullman, director of
women’s athletics, has guaranteed the resurfacing of
the courts this summer, but to Dieffenbach, that
would be small consolation.

“I don’t want them resurfaced,” he said. “I want
them dynamited and buried.”

What Dieffenbach and Gordon both want are new
courts on lower campus (“Behind the law school or
on Bubble’s Field seem to be good spots.”) or indoor
facilities at the present site.

The latter idea is popular with many who believe
the wall—that troublesome, ever-ominous protrusion
only feet behind the baselines at Trees——could be
used as a retainer for the structure.

“If they’re going to have a wall, they might as well
put a ceiling on it,” said Joe Moran, a member of the
Panther squad. “You put ceilings on walls, not air."

These options will be studied when Dieffenbach,
Gordon and other concerned parties meet with
athletic department officials this spring—possibly
sometime in May after tennis season ends. Whether
the talks net better results than as foot fault is now
uncertain, but there are those, Jan Medoff of the
Student Government Board for one, who are wary of

“Dave Hesidence (another SGB member) told me
to go through channels but I don’t see why,” said
Medoff, who is looking into a petition for improved
tennis facilities, “If the football ﬁeld was cracked,
they’d fix it in a hurry.”

If nothing is improved over the summer, Pitts ten-
nis teams will at least have one consolation: the more
you play on bad courts makes you play better on
good courts. « '

said. “Part of the problem I think
stems from the fact that we're such
a young team.”

Leitholf pointed to the team

batting average to justify his _.

opinion.

‘ ‘Everybody’s been hitting pretty
lousy,” he added. “I think the best
average on the team is something
like .333. If I'm not mistaken, Rich
Kline has that. The rest of us aren’t
doing half as well.” V

Leitholf is just as quick to criticize
himself.

“I stink,” he said bluntly. “I
don’t personally look that great. My
ﬁelding’s been pretty good, but my
hitting, well, that’s a different
story. Right now, I’m batting
around .250. I went into this season
thinking I could hit .400.

‘ ‘Although I hope to ﬁnish around
.350 once the season is over, the
way I’m hitting now, I’ll be lucky to
ﬁnish at .300.”

Leitholf, starting his first full
season at shortstop, said pride is the
reason why he is so critical of both
himself and the team.

“I guess I have too much of it,”
he said. ‘ ‘I expect a lot from myself
and the team. Maybe I expect too
much sometimes, but I ﬁgure that’s
the way I am. I believe in giving a
lot of effort.”

After starting the season at ﬁrst
base last season, Leitholf spent the
rest of the season as a utility
inﬁelder. Two years ago, he was
used exclusively in reserve.

Leitholf didn’t play baseball in
either his freshman or sophomore
year. For unknown "reasons,
Leitholf was cut from the team
before both seasons began.

‘ ‘I was offered a baseball
scholarship at Clarion,” he said.
“But I turned that down to come to
Pitt. Clarion has a good athletic
program, but Ithought I would get a
“better education at a bigger school
like Pitt. That and the fact that my
brother and sister had both gone to
school here.

“I tried out for the team in both
my freshman and sophomore

years,” Leitholf said. “I was cut
from the team right before the
season started both times. To this

day, I haven't ﬁgured out why.‘

Coach (Bobby) Lewis and I don’t
talk about it a whole lot.”

The fact that “he still had it in
him to play baseball” led Leitholf to
try out for the team again his junior
year.

‘ ‘I had to prove it to myself that I
could still play baseball,” he said.
“I enjoy the sport. I would have
never forgiven myself if I hadn’t

tried out. There would have always

been that doubt if I hadn’t tried out
whether I could have made it or
not.”

Pitt coach Lewis called Leitholf
“a Ken Macha-type player.”
Lewis, who coached Pirate ‘farm-
hand Macha when the latter played
at Pitt several years ago, said “he
could use Leitholf at any position
without worrying how he’d play.”

“I think I could have him pitch
and he’d do a good job,” Lewis said.
“He’s that type of player.”

Having played all four inﬁeld
positions,‘ Leitholf prefers short-
stop.

‘ ‘I’ve been a shortstop for as long
as I can remember,” said Leitholf.
‘ ‘I enjoy the other positions, too, but
shortstop is a completely different
position than the others in that you
don’t have any particular territory
to cover. You can play deep or short.

You’re more on your own in that.

respect.”

After he completes his studies
next year, Leitholf would like to
become a cartographer. -

Whether it’s playing baseball or
drawing maps, Leitholf believes in
giving 100 percent effort. It’s
another of the reasons he is so quick
to criticize both himself and the
team. 7

“To play baseball, you have to
make sacriﬁces,” Leitholf said.
“You have to bust your butt to play
the game right. I don’t think some
of the kids on the team are willing to
make these sacriﬁces. One day,
they'll probably learn.”

Penn State Cites Exams To Switch Date  

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—Penn State
University, citing a conﬂict with
ﬁnal examinations, is trying to get
Temple to switch its scheduled Nov.
18 college football date to either
Sept. 1 or 2.

Temple officials say they see
advantages and disadvantages to
the 9' ch, but thus far haven’t

-made up their minds.

Almost every year since the
intrastate rivals renewed football
relations in 1975, Penn State coach
Joe Paterno has tried to get
Temple to keep the meeting as an
opening game.

The only time he has succeeded in
the present ﬁve-game series-the
fourth game is coming up in
1978-was in that 1975 season. The
heavily favored Lions edged the
Owls, 26-25, in the opener.

The following year, Paterno
wanted to move the game from late
October to open the season. Temple
refused. State, again the over-
whelming favorite, won, 31-30. Last
season, Temple visited Penn State
in November and lost, 44-7.

A Penn State spokesman denied
Paterno wants the game switched so
the Nittany Lions could have two
games under their belts before the
big one in Columbus with Ohio State
Sept. 16. State plays Rutgers Sept.

9. Penn State is the opener for Ohio
State.

The State spokesman said an
open date beforethe Penn State-Pitt
game Nov 25-the week after Temple
on the present schedule-also wasn’t
a consideration.

DelesusLeadsCubsOver

The Penn State spokesman said
the Temple game falls during a
week of ﬁnal examinations, includ-
ing game day, in State’s tri-semes-
ter system. The conflict wasn't
apparent when the Owls were
scheduled, he said.

“We’re trying to catch up with
this situation,”the spokesman said.

How does Temple feel about a
switch?

“We’ll do it if we feel it's an
advantage to us,” said Ernie Casale
Temple’s athletic director.

Bucs;

Phillies No-I-lit by Forsch, 5-0

CHICAGO (AP)—lvan DeJesus
rapped a single and two doubles
and Greg Gross knocked in two

runs with a pair of singles yesterday 1

to lead Rick Reuschel and the
Chicago Cubs to a 5-1 victory over
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

St. Louis righthander Bob
Forsch, with the help of a
questionable call by the official
scorer, pitched the major league’s
ﬁrst no-hitter of l978 with a 5-0
decision over the Philadelphia
Phillies yesterday.

The triumph was the second in
three decisions for Reuschel. Don
Robinson, a 20-year-old rookie
making his first major league start,

suffered the loss although two of

the runs off him were unearned.

The Cubs scored a run in the
third on an error and singles by
DeJesus and Gross, then broke a
1-1 tie in the ﬁfth when DeJesus

doubled with two out and scored on
Gross’ single.

Pittsburgh scored in the ﬁfth on
a walk to Bill Robinson and singles
by Willie Stargell and Ed Ott.
Fernando Gonzalez then beat out
an inﬁeld single to load the bases,
setting the stage for an odd double
play. '

Phil Garner tapped the ball to the
mound and Reuschel threw to the
plate to force Stargell. Catcher
Dave Rader ﬁred to first, too late to
get Garner, but when Ott tried to
score from second, he was nailed
on Larry Bittner’s return throw to
Rader.

The Cubs added a run in the
seventh on an error by Gonzalez
and a run-scoring double by
DeJesus, then Rader singled home
two runs in the eighth.

aid of a call by Neal Russo, the
official scorer who works for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch.

Garry Maddox, the Phillies’
leadoff hitter in the eighth, drilled a
ground ball past St. Louis third
baseman Ken Reitz into left ﬁeld,
apparently breaking up the no-hit-
ter.

There were groans in the
shivering audience of 11,495 at
Busch Stadium, but these quickly
turned to cheers when Russo called
an error on the Cardinal third
baseman.

Maddox then was wiped out when
Bob Boone hit into a double play.
Forsch then retired the side in the
eighth by getting Sizemore on a low
line drive to Garry Templeton at
short.

In the ninth, Forsch nailed down
the no-hitter by getting pinch-hitter
Jay Johnstone, Bake McBride and
Larry Bowa all on ground balls with
the crowd cheering on every pitch.

Casale said he and football coach

‘ Wayne Hardin had talked about the

Penn State request.

“I want to talk with other people
at the University,” Casale said.
“We have to weigh the pros and
cons.

Among the pros, Casale admit-
ted, was that Temple has a better
chance against Penn State in early
September than in November when
the Lions usually are unbeatable.
Another is that a bigger crowd
might be attracted to Veterans
Stadium for an opener.

If Temple has an average record,
and State is again among the Top 10
come November, that could cut into
the attendance.

On the other hand, Casale said,
Temple would have to start
pre-season practice a week early for
a Sept. 1 or 2 date with Penn State.
And because the Owls have decided
to return to Japan Dec. 10 against
Boston College, Casale is afraid the
season would be too long.

Temple played Grambling in
Japan last December.

Casale also says he wonders if
playing in Philadelphia on Labor
Day weekend is a good idea. It’s still
the vacation season, and also
baseball still has the imagination of
the public.

Temple will make up its mind on
the Penn State request at the end of
spring Practice, Casale said.
