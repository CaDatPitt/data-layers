Pitt students have another dead-
line looming over their heads,
and this time it’s not a paper —
it’s an election.

Students at Pitt '_have three
weekdays left to register for the
election -— and although thou-
sands have registered or rereg—
istered since the start of school
—— get—out-the-vote groups plan

on making a ﬁnal push before the _

Oct. 4 deadline.

Several organizations — in-
cluding the Student Vote Coali-
tion and the Sierra Club —- have/y
coordinated registration efforts
on campus so far this semester.

Miller Nuttle, a full-time
community organizer with the
Sierra Club, said that the group
has been active on campus -
mostly registering freshmen -
since the ﬁrst day of orientation.

The club has three organizers in _

Pittsburgh who wo rk at Pitt, Car-
negie Mellon, Duquesne and the
Community College of Allegheny
County. A 

The Sierra Club is a national
grassroots environmental orga-
nization.

Nuttle said the Sierra Club’s
effort this year was its largest

>THE GOAT’S’ GOT GRASS

- Michael Macagnone I Contributing Editor
Doni, a 6-month—old goat came, to Pitt as part of Programming, Education, Arts and ‘Recreation For
Disadvantaged Students’ (P:EAR) nationwide campaign. P:EAR started its drive a week ago in Port- ‘
’ land, Ore. P:EAR members said they took the goat out of context to try to make a statement. Organizers

stopped by Good Shepherd Elementary School in Braddock yesterday because, “Doni is a kid for kids.”

Learn new languages

Tegan Hanlon
For The Pitt News

Imagine talking to someone from
Tokyo, or Shanghai, and having
him teach you hislanguage.

And then doing the same for
him.

i For more than 200 students
at Pitt, this happens at least once
a week. Pitt’s English Language
Institutepoffers a conversation
partner program for students,

giving foreign language students

— as well as average Pitt students
— the chance to regularly meet
with native speakers from around

A’ the globe.

Megan Stehle, the program’s
coordinator, said -that the pro-
gram allows students to learn in
ways that a classroom experience
cannot reproduce.

“The program is a great op-
portunityto learn more about
different cultiires and languag-
es,” Stehle said.“‘You get to hear
the language you wish to learn
spoken by the native speaker. It

i is not slowed down or aftiﬁcially

produced.”

Those who do notstudy a for- r"

eign language can still join the
program. '

Junior Margo Lynch said that
she only spoke Englishwith her
partner from South Korea, but
that he did teach her a word here
and there.

“Skinny Girls’. Constitution
and Bylaws” isn’t about legis-
lature, but the short story did
help author Tina May Hall win‘
$15,000. A

Hall accepted the Drue Heinz

Literature Prize at a ceremony »

last night in the Frick Fine Arts"
Auditorium in front of more than
80 people — a mix of Pitt stu-
dents and faculty. .
Hall — an associate professor
of English at Hamilton College in
New York —— received the prize

. for her latest book, “The Physics

of Imaginary Objects.”

“It’s a great honor to be a part
of such a great literary tradition,”
said Hall during her acceptance
speech. ~ I

Hall’s book begins with ﬂash
fiction, which Hall saidwas really
short fiction — typically a page
or two in length. She said in an
e-mail that ﬂash fiction is similar
to poetry in that the audience’s
satisfaction comes “from a turn
in the piece-, a moment of revela-
tion, a surprise in the language,
a ﬂash of insight.’’

Hall’s ﬁrst full-length book is
a collection of ﬁfteen short sto-
ries and one novella that she has V
worked on for over a decade.

“I love short stories. I think

h they can accomplish things that

novels can’t,” said Hall. “They
lend themselves to experimenta-
tion. You can try things out on
readers that you wouldn’t expect

them to have tolerance for in a
longer form.”

Chancellor buys new
home in Oakland

Mark Nordenberg still needs to live in Shadyside.

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

A Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg bought
a new house this week on Bigelow Bou-

levard.

The Allegheny County Department of
Real Estate records showed that Mark and
Nikki Nordenberg ﬁled the complete deed
for the $800,000 property on Sept. 27.

Pitt requires the chancellor to live in
the University Residence, which is on De-
vonshire Street in Shadyside.

Nordenberg issued a short statement
yesterday which indicated that the pur-
chase was not a sign that he would retire
soon.

“This purchase is the product of that
longer—term personal planning and not a
signal thatl expect my service as'chancel—

lor to come to an end at any time in the '

near future,” he said. .

The chancellor and his family have
owned a house for years in the city’s East
End.

The statement and the county’s online
records did not indicate that the Norden—
berg family had sold that house.

“[The purchase] reﬂects our strong
commitment to this community, where we
now have lived for more than thirty years,
and where we intend to continue living
whenever my service as chancellor does
come to an end,” Norldenberg said.

fort to date.
“We really want to empower young

voters. To help have their voices heard,” .

he said.

Since that first day in late August, they
have picked up more than 1,700 registra-
tions. Nuttle said they want to get to 3,000
on Pitt’s campus by Monday. He called it
their “blitz week.”

“It’s a little ambitious, but we want to
get as close as we can,” he said.

He also said that their success has
largely come through the efforts of vol-

« unteers from student groups like the Black
r Action Society, Kappa Kappa Gamma and

Theta Phi Alpha.

They have tabled outside the William
Pitt Union and around other parts of cam-
pus over the past several weeks. V

Other student groups — including Pitt
College Democrats and Pitt College Repub-
licans — have worked with the Student
Vote Coalition on campus.

John Hasley —, a Pitt junior, coordi-
nator for the Student Vote Coalition and
new ‘member of the Student Government
Board -4 said the coalition is comprised
of representatives from more than 30 stu-
dent groups. t

Hasleyestimated that over the past
several'weeks,they‘have registered around

r 2,000 students.

Tabling in high—trafﬁc areas like Tow-
ers Lobby and the William Pitt Union con-
tributed to the numbers. ’

Hasley said that since this was the first

SGB—sanctioned voter registration drive,
he thought that the number of students
who registered to vote was greater than
last year’s. ‘

Pitt College Democrats President Kelli
Vandergrift said that, working with the
coalition, they have helped to register
students by tabling and attending campus
events. But they came up with a novel way
to approach voters — this Saturday they
want to register voters waiting in line for
buses to the Pitt football game. _

College Republicans President Rachel
Feinstein said that volunteers with the
coalition will table until the end of this
week with registration forms and absen-
tee ballots, which are available from the
county.

Hasley saidthat the Student Vote‘Coali—
tion will not table on Monday becauseof
time constraints.

Even if students have their registration
forms postmarked by Oct. '4, the forms will

' probably not get processed by the end of

business hours oneMonday. '0

If students are going to mail their
forms, Hasley suggests they do it by Sat-
urday. A t _ - -

, After the Oct. 4'deadline, Nuttle said
th_at»t~he Club will continue to launch get-
out—the—vote events until election day.
They intend to keep in touch with stu-
dents and try to get them to pledge to
vote, which he said will make them more
likely to vote.

“We’re‘ going to keep it up all of the way

Libya, South Korea and France.

“If you want to practice their language
you can, but a lot of time it’s fun and, not
to mention, really useful for them to speak
in English for a large chunk of time,” Lynch
said. i

The international students involved
come from all over the globe.

They are enrolled in the academic Eng-
lish program, so most of them are at Pitt
for about two semesters, Stehle said.

ELI is part of Pitt’s Department of Lin-
guistics.

The institute is open to international
students admitted to Pitt who wish to work
on their language skills. Students must

«have intermediate skill in English to be a

part of the program, Rob Mucklo — Mar-
keting and Activities Coordinator for ELI
— said in an interview last Thursday.

While the conversation program helps
international students develop better lan-
guage skills,‘ it’s not just about learning
English, it’s about experiencing American
culture, Mucklo said. '

“We try to let [international students]
make American friends. They love sharing
their culture,” Mucklo said. _

He "said that the program is about mu-
tual respect and exchange between stu-

dents.

There are 114 international students
currently enrolled in the conversation
program and 95 English-speaking Pitt
students. ‘ .

Japanese and Spanish are the languages
most common studied by English-speaking
participants, and the majority of students

knowledged that not all students have the
resources to travel to a different country
to improve their speaking abilities.
“Students should deﬁnitely get a con-
versation partner if they have the chance.
The partner provides some sort of native
contactwith the language if they haven’t

gone to do study abro'ad,” Nardone said.

who are learning English originally speak
Arabic, Chinese or Korean.

The ELI encourages partners to talk at

least one hour every week, Stehle said.
The partners ‘coordinate the time

frame and the location of their weekly

meetings. ' 4 .

The program can help those who want
to study abroad, too. , *

The program has upsides beyond im-

besides being able to practice her skills
with a native speaker, she can make inter-
national friends through the conversation

“You basically spend an hour or more
a week hanging out, drinking coffee and

“Mrs. Heinz is no longer able to travel

This will help students get up-to—date

Nuttle said that the “unprecedented”

You would think that a taxpayer-

of “Satan’s representative” who sits at

U.S. suffers union-itis

As much as President Barack
Obama idealizes the American
worker and touts the strength of
unions and the possibility of liv-
ing wages for everyone, it’s time
to face the facts and realize that
if that’s the American dream, it’s
no longer going to make it out of
the REM cycle. _

wouldn’t. Although this was an
isolated incident that involved
just-a few of the 2,500 workers,
according to a Chrysler blog, it
presented an ugly angle of freshly
bailed-out blue-collar workers

- taking advantage of taxpayer dol-

lars and exploiting just how little
attentiveness or skill is needed to
adequately perform jobs paying as
much as $77 per hour, according
to The New York Times.

Last week, auto workers at

much pay. And that still might
be too much money for too little
work.

According to Vice President

Joe Biden, the recession caused
subsequent shedding of 431,000
automotive jobs in 2008 and we
ﬁgured out that many businesses

Don't let terrorism revive Mccarthy

Andrew Kaback
For The Pitt News

I am no fan of terrorism. I don’t like it one
bit. I think terrorists are irrational, insane
and in desperate need of a toothbrush.
From al- Qaida to Hamas, I just don’t get it.
What’s not to like about America? We gave
the-world Walmart. Not to mention the Kim
Kardashian sex tape. v

I can’t fathom what it is about their lac
of hair products and limited ﬁlmmaking
skills that makes terrorists so angry all of
the time. The whole suicide bombing thing?
I haven’t seenlanything so emo since the last
Dashboard Confessional music video.

But I have tolcome to the realization that
asking terrorists to stop it would be about
equivalent to asking Bill Clinton to put his
pants back on —— it’s just not going’ to hap-
pen. Trust me, if we could just pick some
random country in the Middle East and
invade it under false pretense with the hopes
that we can both annihilate every possible
terrorist and drive oil prices down, I’d be all
for it. Oh, did we try that already?

Unfortunately, the world doesn’t seem
to work that way, or, at least, the Middle
East doesn’t seem to work that way. The
entire terrorist plan is built off the fact that
America is militarily superior. Now while
former Defense Secretary Donald Rums-
feld looks up what a plan is, I would like to
point out that this means that the United
States has to ﬁght with things other than
just bombs.

Hold on, Republican Party, I already
know what you are going to say. And no, I
do not hate America. Somewhere between
the Patriot Act and common sense sits this
notion that treating Middle Easterners like

people is somehow un—American. So while
George Bush looks up what common sense
is, let me be the ﬁrst to say that I understand
liberals and war aren’t exactly Batman and
Robin. Heck, if we’d pulled out of Iraq too
early, America would have been nothing
more than a high school kid on prom night:
embarrassed and unsatisﬁed. p
Liberals haven’t staged a well—done war
since Roosevelt was rolling around. John-
son screwed up Vietnam. Carter screwed
up Iran. Michael Dukakis tried to ride in a
tank. Maybe the Democrats aren’t the most
Caesar-esque of the bunch.Just because lib-
erals are better lovers than ﬁghters (no, re-
ally ladies, we are much better lovers), does
that somehow make them un—American?
America has had a lot of enemies over the
years. It all started with the Brits and their

damn taxes. Ironically, British people have '

dental hygiene equally as bad as terrorists’.
The list continues with the Germans, the
Japanese, the Germans again, the South.
You know, the Germans sucked there for
a while. I

The point is that every time America has
been involved in a conﬂict, we’ve thrown
away the very principles that have made
us such a great nation. Between Japanese
internment camps, the ﬁrebombing of
Dresden and Sherman’s March down South,
America has compromised its-standards
faster than a drunk guy at a frat party. We
cannot allow terrorism to become the next

communism!

Have we no sense of decency? If vic-
tory against terrorists is only to be found
by perpetuating the terrifying and deadly
conditions that Iraqis and Afghans need
to live with on a daily basis, then where is
our decency? If ﬁghting terrorism means
that we can’t allow American Muslims to
build community centers and keep their
holy books away from our bonﬁres, then
where is our decency? The war on terrorism
is all about principles, so we certainly can’t
forget our own.

Okay, so I know what you’re thinking,
and it’s not true. I am not just trying to make

the Dixie Chicks cool again, although I hear.

they’re not quite ready to make nice either.

' The point is that we mustthandle this war

responsibly.

 

Not agreeing with military action is not
un—American. Terrorists suck. They really
suck. But there is no reason to go all Joe
McCarthy on anybody who doesn’t think
we need to drop bombs like Outkast. Yes, we
have just ended military operations in Iraq
— although I thought we’d accomplished
that mission a while ago, Bush. Keep our
soldiers in your thoughts, and while you’re
at it, let some innocent Iraqis and Afghans
enter them too. And for heaven’s sake, will
somebody show al-Qaida how to use a cam-
era?

tion, the American union worker began
losing prestige. Unions became an unnec-
essary anachronism from a time that once
was and never will be again.

This recent trend doesn’t just apply
to the manufacturing industry. Unions in
many other sectors have had the same effect
on our economy.

Earlier this month, New Jersey Gov.
Chris Christie hosted a town-hall meeting
at which _a schoolteacher attacked his policy
that cut pay raises, forced staff cuts and dis-
placed compensation the teacher believed
she deserved. Christie responded that he
had originally asked only for a 1.5 percent
contribution to medical beneﬁts and a one-
year pay freeze, but the teachers’ union had
opposed any sort of concession.

“The teacher’s union made a decision,”
he said. “They’d rather stand by their cur-

rent contracts and make no compromise
despite our awful economic circumstances,
and they allowed members to be laid off.

There would not have been anywhere
near the ‘amount of layoffs if a pay freeze
was taken.”

Having to justify cuts to balance an $11
billion budget deﬁcit at a town-hall meet-
ing while facing a similarly hostile crowd
last May, Christie said, “Unlike the United
States of America, the State of New Jersey
can’t print money,” according to Business
Insider.

Our economy is based around supply
and demand._]obs that demand more money
than what they’re worth have already be-
gun declining, and they’re going to decline
further. ‘ e ‘

When members of the manufacturing
industry — Where many nonunion workers

Unions aren’t evil, but they’re not necessary

make living wages in right-to—work states
— education or any other industry promul-
gatesunion ideals, it has become necessary
to review whether a union in the workplace
is doing more harm than good.

Unions aren’t evil. They’ve bolstered
the American worker to greater heights
than he would have otherwise been lifted
to‘ during eras of corruption. .

But in many subsectors of our economy,
the truth is that they’re no longer neces-
sary. And in many cases, they’ve actually
become the same sort of forceful, unyield-
ing monoliths they were originally designed
to thwart.

CLO Cabaret

Pitt Arts’ tickets $15
www.pittarts.pitt.edu

I Much like gourmet coffee beans, the

cast members of “Triple Espresso”
are hand-selected to ensure the
highest quality of humor for every
performance. V
The comedy, appearing at the
CLO Cabaret now through Jan. 9,

involves a special skill set for each .

character. That makes it difﬁcult to
ﬁnd individuals like the current ac-
tors, Brian Kelly, Christopher Hart
and Dane Stauffer, by chance.

The show follows as three friends
reminisce about their ﬁrst meetings

and the lengths they went to try-

ing to get their comedy act off the
ground. Through songs, stories,
magic tricks and shadow puppets,
they tell theircomically unfortunate
tale to the audience, even including

viewers in the action at times.

Though the play has three
characters, Hugh Butternut, Buzz
Maxwell and Bobby Bean, there’s

a whole pool of actors to play each

character and at times there are
multiple shows buzzing at once in
different locations. Though it seems
as though the show could never be
the same twice, the actors are vigor-
ously trained so the performance

_ runs smoothly.

“This is sort of meant to look off-
the-cuff but it’s very tight  It’s like
a well-oiled machine,” Stauffer, who
plays Hugh Butternut, said, “There’s
a standard we’re trying to hit each
tune,”

Playing this character involves
the use of speciﬁc skills, like piano
playing and singing in the midst of
acting, as Butternut is the resident

songbird and frequently breaks

into well—known tunes. Stauffer, a .

seasoned actor, has participated in
improv at the sketch house Dudley
Riggs’ Brave New Workshop in ad-
dition to numerous other stage and
commercial productions. These-ex-
periences prepared him for the some
of the unexpected moments that go
along with live theater.

“I’m often grateful for my improv
experience,” he said. ‘

Brian Kelly:

lyrics for him while his  were
occupied with his guitar, .couldn’t
ﬁnd his guitar in the prop area. He
quickly decided to conduct with his

» hands and the audience members

were none the wiser.

Kelly ﬁnds those kinds of saves
extremely entertaining- In fact,
he enjoys watching how his stage-

mates deal with having to work-

through issues.
“I love when stuff like that hap-

“It’s fun to Watch a fellow actor

struggle”

Stauffer isn’t the only veteran im-
prov performer who  had to use
his resourcefulness on the ﬂy. Brian
Kelly, who plays Bobby Bean, re-
called once when, right before a skit
where he was supposed to bring up
an audience member under the pre-
tense of needing someone to hold up

pens  it’sfunto watch afellow actor
struggle,” he said.
- This sort of working under pres-

= sure has been a staple on Kelly’s re‘-

sume. He’s participated in shows like

‘“Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding” as well as
in improv organizations like Com-
edysportz. However, he found that

, his background hadn’t quite pre-

pared him for the stringent training
required by the CLO performance.
“It’s some of the most intense

‘ rehearsal I’ve ever been through.

I’d always been pushed into shows
with one rehearsal, paraphrasing
my way though,” he said.

The third actor, Christopher
Hart, who plays Buzz Maxwell, had
an even more interesting transition.

’ He went from a magician to an actor

playingabad magician. At’ the begin-
ning of casting, the show’s organiz-
ers were seeking actors whom they

planned to train in magic. Theysoon ’

realized that it worked better to have
magicians train as actors. Though
he is skilled at sleight of hand,‘Hart

' still had some difficulties to work

through. U
‘fFiguring out my comedy timing

was the work I had to do. You have to

be a really good magician to kind of

do magic badly. You have to have a I

really good understandingg of what

the Day has a lot on its plate.

On Thursday, Mr. Small’s Theatre will host
the band, along with River City Extension and
Big Hurry, at an all—ages show.

Though Saves the Dayhas performed around
Pittsburgh before, this will be the band’s ﬁrst
time at Mr. Small’s Theatre. Chris Conley, the

band’s frontman and oldest member, said he is
excited about performing again in Pittsburgh.
For almost two decades, the band has been in
and out of Pittsburgh for shows, he said.

“We’re dying to come back to play,” Conley
said. “It’s time to get back and have a rockin’
nigh ”

Alongwith Conley, members Arun Bali, Ro-
drigo Palma and Spencer Peterson now make
up the band. Over the past two years, former
members David Soloway, Manuel Carrero and
Durijah Lang dropped out of the group in order
to pursue other projects. Yet Conley explains
that the three newer members really bring out
the evolution of Saves the Day.

“We became more of a traveling entity,” he
said, “I needed people who liked to tour.”

‘The Royal Family’ reminiscent of Barrymore clan

Royal < 9

Courtesy Pittsburgh Public Theater
Evan Alex Cole and Lindsey Kyler in Pittsburgh Public Theater’s pro-
duction of “The Royal Family”

of musical theatre, having played
such immortal roles as Mrs. Lovett
in Sweeney Todd, Annie Oakley
in Annie Get Your Gun and Miss
Hannigan in Annie, but ﬁnds the
transition from musicals to plays
without singing to be smooth. She
explains that the difference is easy
for her: In one there are songs and
dancing and in the other there is
not.

“It keeps everything balanced
for me. I think that it calls on dif-
ferent skills, but in both a musical

and a play there has to be complete

truth and honesty from the char-
acters,” she said.

“The Royal Family” has a
special connection with the city
of Pittsburgh because one of its
writers, Kaufman, was born in the
Steel City. Aside from this play, he
is best known for the Pulitzer Prize
and Tony Award—winning musical

“‘Guys and Dolls.” In addition to

Ferber, his collaborators’ include
Moss Hart on “You Can’t Take It
With You” and the ﬁve Marx broth—
ers who starred in his works “The
Cocoanuts” and “A Night at the
Opera.”

The other writer of “The Royal
Family,” Ferber, received a Pulitzer
prize for her book “So Big.” Her

novels “Show Boat” and “Giant” .

are more famous for the adapta-
tions that they inspired. “Show
Boat” was made into a musical of
the same name byjerome Kern and
Oscar Hammerstein, and “Giant”
was made into a ﬁlm of the same
name starring Elizabeth Taylor and
James Dean.

The actors’ work would be
incomplete without the vision of
director Ted Pappas. He brings to
life each character in a new way,
even if he has to do double duty
for certain actors.

This is the case with co~star
Tony Bingham. Fresh from his
stint in last season’s “A Midsum-
mer’s Night Dream,” Bingham por-
trays two characters, prizeﬁghter
McDermott and Indian traveler
Gunga. As McDermott, he gets to
engage in an onstage swordﬁght.
Because Bingham had prior ex-
perience with sword combat, his
preparation for the action was very

Both of Bingham’s characters
interact with the Cavendish youth.
For example, McDermott trains
Julie to ﬁght the way a stuntman

“The differentiation between

Despite all the fun and theatrif
cality of this show, it has great sub-
stance. At nearly 90 years of age,
it was revived on Broadway last
season starring Rosemary Harris
and;Ana Gasteyer. This continuing
relevance has a lot to do with the
pop culture—centric society that
exists today.

Whether it is the Barrymores or
the Kardashians, America seems
to be cycling through a bevy of fa-
mous families to idolize. *

“It gives you more of an insight

ing it up,” he said.

However, his stage experience helped the
acting to become natural to him. Soon, the ac-
tors, who have to argue, laugh, and eventually
bond over their ridiculous past, were on stage
working together as though they really were
these characters.

“The three of us have done the show to-
gether quite a bit  and we like each other
as people. I think that’s reﬂected in this 
because we’re friends and we laugh  it’s be-
lievable that we could have been in this rela-
tionship because we are legitimately friends,”
he said.

And at it’s core, the show is really just plain
funny. Though the actors bring up participants
from the audience to play on stage with them,

Band to play songs

from new album

Saves the Day 4 10

in October, it’s necessary to have each member
on the same page and willing to travel.

Conley expressed more than just content-
ment with the new members’ desire to tour.
Each member has something different to offer
the band, as well as the capability to hold onto
the past sound of Saves the Day, he said. Conley
believes the new arrangement provides a sort
of ﬁision that is unlike before.

“The landscape of sound is very lush,” he
said.

Bali, guitarist of Saves the Day for about
two years, is also pleased with the current ar-
irangement.

“It’s cool coming into a situation like this

land getting to be creative on new stu ,” Bali 7

lsaid in an e—mail. “Chris and I are on a similar
wavelength when it comes to music, so it’s been
great for both of us.”

For the show at Mr. Small’s Theatre, the band
iplans on playingavariety of music. There will be
lsongs from every album in order to please older
‘and newer fans. Saves the Day tends to provide
‘a good balance of music for its shows.

A few songs from Saves the Day’s new al- ‘

bum Daybreak, which should be coming out in
a few months, will also be included in Thurs-
day night’s show. Dcgxlarea/e is the third part of
a trilogy that expresses a sort of acceptance
for life. '
“Dg117rea,é is the album in the trilogy where
I really come back to life,” Conley said.
I Unlike the ﬁrst two parts of thetrilogy, the
{third has a much more upbeat and positive vibe
§to its lyrics. Conley explained that the whole
ltrilogy acted in a therapeutic way for him as it
helped him overcome certain obstacles in his
past. The acoustic version of the new song “Let
It All Go” is featured on Saves the Days website
lto give listeners a taste of the album. I

energetic

the humor is clean. And even though the show
touts that it’s for anyone from “ages 6-106,”
which makes it seem as though it might be
cheesy, the actors all agree that the show is
downright hysterical for everyone.

“It’s the funniest show I’ve ever been a
part of and I’ve done a lot of funny shows  ;
it resonated with audiences in a way that’s ‘ f _.
different than any comedy show I’ve ever done

‘"‘:WOMEN’S SOCCER

Ruhe sisters make mark on college soccer

Dadija Bliudzius I Staff Photographer

Katie Ruhe is playing women’s soccer at Pitt while two of her sisters
play at other schools along the east coast.

Lauren Kirschman‘

Senior Staff" Writer

When Katelyn Ruhe was a senior,
she led Ur_bana High School to its
ﬁrst—ever women’s soccer Mary-

land state championship — and

she did it with some familiar faces
by her side: her youngersisters.
“My senior year, we won it with
the three of us on the team,” Ruhe
said. “It was unexplainable, re-

‘ . ally, to go out winning with your

sisters.”
In the Ruhe family, soccer is a
sport passed down from sister to

S sister. It started with Ruhe’s older

sister, Jen, who played soccer at
the University of Richmond for
four years. Ruhe’s younger sisters
are twins: Amie is a freshman at
Seton Hall while Julie is playing
at.Radford.

The Ruhe sisters don’t just play
soccer, they excel at it.

After her senior year at Rich-
mond, Jen was an Atlantic 10
Honorable Mention and NSCAA

All—Mid—Atlantic Region Second
Team selection.

Julie has started all eight games
for Radford this season. She leads
the team with four goals and added
one assist. Amie played in all ten
of Seton Hall’s games and started
nine. She’s scored two goals and
collected three assists-

Jen started playing soccer
when she was about 5 years old,
Ruhe said, and the next year, Ruhe
wanted to be just like her older
sister. '

“I wanted to play too, just like
every little kid,” she said.

And on down the line it went,
until every one of the Ruhe sis-
ters was playing soccer. They all
kept up with the sport through
the years until each one found
herself performing at the colle-
giate level.

Now, Ruhe is a junior at’ who
has started in every Pitt game
since following the family tradi-
tion. .

_ “We all just stuck with it some-
how,” Ruhe said. “I really don’t

know why. My parents didn’t play
sports or anything. We all just kept
playing and started playing club,
getting better and getting more
serious about it.” ,
Growing up with sisters around
the same age all playing the same
sport was competitive, but fun,
Ruhe said. She added that it was
convenient to have them around
to practice with. When she was in
high school, Ruhe’s dad set up a
goal for the sisters in their front

yard. She said they would spend‘

a lot of time honing their skills
together.
“None of us were goalkeepers,

but when we went down there, one »

of us would play goalie so we could
work on our skills,” she said.

' Althoughjen, who graduated,
is “kind of out of the soccer loop
now,” Ruhe said she talks to her
younger sisters constantly about
what is happening with their
soccer careers, from phone calls
about wins to encouraging each
other after losses.

“We deﬁnitely help each other

VOLLEYBALL

,,Panthers ben

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ Writer

 -'5}/Vith a record of 6-11 (1-1 Big East),
it may seem as though the Pitt
women’s volleyball team has had
little success in their early season
play.

But that record is deceiving, as

wit fails to take into consideration
"the high caliber of the teams the
Panthers have faced in the early
going so far this year.

“We had a pretty rigorous pre-
season schedule,” senior middle .
hitter Imani Harper said. “We

rﬂinplayed teams that were ranked in
the top 20 in the nation, and oth-

, ers that ﬁt comfortably in the top

50.”

The Panthers fell to then—No.
21 Dayton and No. 9 Washington
in three sets while taking one set

from the match loss to No. 14 Ten- '

nessee. -

But with the beginning of Big
East Conference competition, both
Harper and head coach Toby Rens
believe that preseason experience
will be beneﬁcial. 7

“By playing highly competi
tivetearns, we put ourselves in a
great position for conference play,”
Harper said. '

“The tournament schedule al-
lowed us to play teams that could
expose our weaknesses so we could
see where to make improvements,”
Rens said.

Some of those improvements
included serving and blocking,
aspects of the game addressed in
this week’s practices before Big
East matches against Rutgers and
Seton Hall. L -

“As a team, we all know that
serving and blocking are integral
parts of the game,” Harper said.

V “We want to see improvement in

both of those areas.” _ ,

Their importance was further
emphasized in Pitt’s ﬁrst.two»Big
East matches.

The Panthers have started con-
ference play with a 1-1 record after
defeating DePaul 3-1 and then fall-
ing to Notre Dame in three sets.

Pitt committed 13 service errors

in the matches and was out-blocked

by Notre Dame.

”_ In the match against DePaul,
Harper recorded a personal-best 21
kills while fellow senior Amy Town
added 17 kills from the outside hit-
ter position.

Harper’s performance also led to
her place on the Big East Volleyball
Weekly Honor Roll, which selects
ﬁve athletes each week who have

- shown superior performance.

“I have been impressed with
Harper’s play this year,” Rens
said. “Her blocking adds another
dimension to our team, and as a
senior, her leadership is valuable
as well.” ‘ ,

This was Harper’s ﬁrst appear-
ance on the Big East Honor Roll. ,

The Panthers will play both Rut-

gers and Seton Hall on the ma M,
marking their third and fourth
consecutive away matches. .

Rens acknowledged that playing
at home does have its advantages,
and the Panthers will return to the
Fitzgerald Field House after facing
Seton Hall. V .

For now, though, the focus is on
the Rutgers match on Friday and
the Seton Hall match on Sunday.

Rutgers (7-8, 0-2) will be look-
ing for their ﬁrst "Big East victo
while Seton Hall (6-11, 1-1) will bf,
coming off of their ﬁrst win ov 3.
Louisville in school history. Th
Pirates defeated the Cardinals,
picked to ﬁnish second in the Big
East, in a 3-2 match. -

an-!'>~.~.v.:ir9‘.I.5'

upcoming NHL season

Blue Jackets will make a playoff run, Capitals will not

Greg Trietley
Senior Stajf Writer

 

It’s the best time of the year for sports.
College and pro football are underway,
baseball is racing toward its postseason,
and, best of all, hockey starts in a week.
Hockey again, already? I’m dizzy from
the‘anticipation. I’m not thinking sensibly
right now — I’m too excited! So here are
seven bold, possibly crazy predictions for
the season ahead, one for each day until

needed to land a top defenseman — Tomas
Kaberle —— at the deadline. With an elite
blueliner on board, Columbus completes
the Cinderella formula: young forwards
maturing before our eyes, a hot goalie and
just enough of Mike Commodore’s hair. :

#2: The Washington Capitals fall
early in the postseason again.

The Capitals won the Presidents’ Troi
phy with 121 points last year, but they col-
lapsed in the ﬁrst round of the playoffs
against a Montreal team that scored 103

Until Washington balances out their lineup,

teams will find a way to stop their offense

in the playoffs.

Carolina and Minnesota kick off the season
next Thursday at noon.

#1: The Columbus Bluejackets make
the Western Conference Finals.

I’ll start with the gutsiest one. The Blue
Jackets ﬁnished 14th in the conference last
season, but they rode rookie phenom Steve
Mason’s play in goal into the playoffs the
year before that. They have a very good,
skilled forward group with veteran depth
on the lower lines.

V And Mason is still around. He struggled
last year, but he’s just 22 years old. Marc-
André Fleury started games at Mason’s age
and went through the same ups and downs
before establishing himself as a starter.

The defense needs improvement, but

- Columbus has the cap room and prospects

less goals than they did in the regular seagf
son. It’s going to happen again. 1

Washington isn’t built for the playoffs?’
Football’s Indianapolis Colts rolled with a
high—powered offense for years without
a Super Bowl. Only when they improvedr
the defense did Peyton Manning win his
championship. ‘ V

You could drive a car through Washing-
ton’s linebackers, er, defense right now.
Mike Green scored 76 points last year, but
the Canadiens tore him apart in his own
zone and shut him down in theirs. Until
Washington balances out their lineup,
teams will ﬁnd a way to stop their offense
in the playoffs.

I’ll say New Jersey does it this year.

#3: Sidney Crosby sets a career high
in assists.

the school. They recruited me, so I took a
chance and here I am.”

Pitt head coach Sue—Moy Chin said she
learned about Ruhe from one of her high
school friends, but the Panther coaches
didn’t get to see Ruhe play during her junior
year because. of the ACL injury.

“Her friend said ‘Hey, there’s a girl that
is outstanding and coming back for her
senior year. You have to see,”’ Chin said. “I
got to see her play really late and she was

out with soccer,” Ruhe said. “We always
just talk about how it is and how we’re do-
ing.”

Ruhe found her way to Pittsburgh from
rural Frederick, Md. She said she wanted
a change of environment at college. She’s
majoring in communications and after her
undergraduate career ends, she wants to
go back to nursing school to become a hos-
pice nurse. V

“I wanted a big school,” she said. “I actu-
ally visited in the pouring rain, the worst

Ruhe contributes great athleticismto Panthers

just a fantastic player.”
Chin said that Ruhe is probably one of

the team’s most ﬁt players. She’s a leader

by example, she said, and a main stand at
midﬁeld.

“Her ability to dribble with speed is just
fantastic,” Chin said. “She’s meant a lot to
this program. She’s really raised the level
of ﬁtness within the program.”

Ruhe’s speed and athleticism stood out
from the time she was being recruited, Chin
said, as did her ability to win balls and

.:..;.f_‘

complete passes.

Chin added that Ruhe still has room for
improvement, such as working on balance
when striking the ball, something she said
the junior would be the ﬁrst to admit.

Ruhe said she’s matured and relaxed?‘
since arriving at Pitt as a freshman.

“I am a really competitive person on the
ﬁeld and I used to get so frustrated with
myself,” she said. “When I mess up, I don’t
take it as hard. I think I really matured and
relaxed.” I
