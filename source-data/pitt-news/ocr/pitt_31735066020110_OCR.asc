UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH V
Students express
concern on merger

FRIDAY, across: 10, 1936...

VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE E|GHTEENl[;.r 

 

pharmacy schools

By Brenda Bravis

For The Pitt News

Students in the health professions

are expressing concern about the
University of Pittsburgh's proposal to
merge the nursing and pharmacy
schools with the School of Health
Related Professions.

The proposal is nearing its final

stages and could be implemented as
early as spring I987. ’

The proposal is part of the original

University of Pittsburgh Planning
Process initiated by former provost
Roger Benjamin.

According to Jerome Cochran,

assistant vice president for the health
sciences, ”lfthe plan is approved, its
success will depend upon the facul-
ty accepting it as an appropriate thing
to do.”

Some nursing students have ex-

pressed concern over. some of the
changes that will occur due to the '
merger.

”lt bothers me that nursing students

will graduate from a department of
nursing rather than a school of nurs-
ing,” said Diane Chubb, a junior nur-
sing student. ”Who knows how that
will affect prospective employers’ im—
pressions of the nursing program?”

However, according to the

organizational concept which has
been presented to the three Schools
of Nursing, Pharmacy and Health
Related Professions, they will main-
tain their status as individual schools
within the larger administrative unit.

”Several other institutions in the

country are moving in this direction,”
said Cochran, who feels the plan has
many positive aspects and few
negative ones.

”The students of the several

disciplines will receive portions of
their training together during their
academic years and develop inter-
professional relationships that will

hopefully continue through their pro-
fessional practice years.”

Another concern expressed by
several students is the potential
reduction in the number of faculty as
a result of having several basic
science courses taught in the same
format to all students, rather than
each specific discipline having its
own exclusive curriculum.

Senior physical therapy student
Tressa Bitonti said, ’’It will be difficult
to expect the nurses, the physical
therapists or whoever, to get what is
pertinent to their profession out of
basic science classes. Each discipline
has different implications." J

Cochran said that members of the
senior vice president's staff, as well
as many faculty members in the three
schools, believe that there are certain
basic instructional programs which
are common to all three schools even

while recognizing the existence of‘

morespecific requirements in the in-
dividual schools.

in addition, Cochran said it has V

been suggested that the basic science
curriculum in all of the affected
disciplines may require expansion in
order to produce future non-
physician, health-related profes-
sionals who are better prepared to
practice their specialty.-

Some students are also concerned
about having to merge some of their
facilities.

’’I think that the nurses are getting
the short end of the deal, because we
have more facilities to offer the
merger, and these facilities ar_e
specialized to nursing, and I do not
feel it's fair to have to diversify our
LRC for the other schools,” said
Chubb.

Related to this concern, Cochran
indicated that savings in resources
currently allocated to all three
schools will be pumped back into the

Merante

Pitt, USC bound

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

Joseph A. Merante, director of
admissions and financial aid for
the past eight years, is leaving Pitt
to accept a similar position at the
University of Southern California.

Merante will leave Pitt just after
Thanksgiving and will start at USC

’ in-December.

”At USC, I'll be doing work on
a larger basis; working with
graduate and international
students in a program that is the
first of its kind in thecountry,”
Merante said.

Lynn Hutton, vice president of
USC, said the school pursued
Merante for the position.

”Over the summer we asked
him to serve on an advisory coun-
cil to help evaluate our admis-
sions and financial aid depart-
ment,” Hutton said. ”During the
course of the work we were very
impressed with the work he did.”

leaving  

tion is a new one which he helped
design.

”He was very interested in the
position, but he had reluctance
about leaving Pitt," Hutton said.
”He’s done an excellent job there
and is heldin very high regard. I
know it was a difficult decision for
him.” ‘

Betsy Porter, an assistant to
Merante, said Merante’s successor
has not yet been named. Merante
is not scheduled to leave until
Dec. 1. _

Merante worked with ad-
ministrators from Boston Univer-
sity and Notre Dame while
reviewing the admissions and
financial aid program at USC. S

‘'1 think he came out here for
the challenge and -opportunities
USC will provide,” Hutton said.
"We're looking forward to his ar-
rival.”

John Yeager, vice president of
management and budget, who
will determine Merante’s replace-
ment,*could not be reached for
comment. ’

According to Merante, the posi-

Protesters gathered on Bigelow patio yesterday to voice their views on divestment.

Protesters call for Pitt's total 
divestment from South Africa 

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

An estimated 250 people gathered
to chant, ”Let’s go Pitt — out of South
Africa!” at yesterday's pro-divestment
rally aimed at persuading Pitt's board
of trustees to divest all financial
holdings from businesses operating in
South Africa. ‘

P0 SGB supports divestment, page 3

Tony Baldwin, president of Pitt's
Black Action Society, called it ”The
greatest day of solidarity [at Pitt] for
the people of South Africa.”

A banner hanging from the
Bigelow Boulevard side of the
William Pitt Union read: Pitt, there's
blood on your portfolio.

”Those who are saying apartheid
is changing, and black people should
be patient and that sanctions will hurt
blacks, are merely thinking the op-
pressed people of South Africa are
asking for pity in their fight against
apartheid, but this is not the case,”
said Mweli Mzizi, member of the
African National Congress and
featured speaker at the rally.

”|f‘the University of Pittsburgh i

chooses to go it alone [not to divest],
then we, the oppressed but fighting
people of South Africa, will be left
with no other choice but to believe
that this" university and its board of
trustees are racists,” Mzizi said.

‘ Mzizi is from Soweto, South'Africa,
and has been in the United States for
five years.

Universities across the country are
choosing to divest —— most recently
Bucknell University, which original-
ly had $70 million invested in South
African corporations and institutions.

Mzizi saidif Pitt does not follow
this trend for its obvious
humanitarian reasons, it will reflect
badly on the university.

”lf the prime minister of South
Africa, Reagan andothers sayrthey
are against sanctions because they're
not going to be effective, my ques-
tion is, why are they so much against
sanctions if they think they're not go-
ing to be effective,” said Mzizi.

He said the students of Pitt should
have a say in how the university in-
vests its money, and they have an
obligation to take part in the divest-
ment campaign.

Trudy Bayer, a teaching fellow in ,

the department of communications
and a protestor at the rally, said, ’’I’m

very upset that [Pitt is] working’

against the struggle of the people of
South Africa.”
’’I think it's unconscionable,” said

Loomis Mayfield, a graduate student .

in the history department, in
reference to the trustee's position on
the issue of divestment.

Law student Susanna Liberty said-

the trustees appear to be self-serving.

’’I would like to see them take
more courageous action and go for.
complete divestment,” Liberty said.

’’I think it's up to_the students and
community to put the kind of
pressure Pitt needs on its board of
trustees,” said Fahamisha Brooks, a
graduate student in the School of
Public Health. ”The fact that the
university refuses to divest is a bad
reflection on the city of Pittsburgh.”

The Pittsburgh City Council recom-
mended that the board vote to divest
and officially declared Oct. 8 as Pitt
Divestment Day.

Theboard of trustees is scheduled
to review the matter at a meeting on
Oct. 14. . - *

IState iDept.Spokesman Cluits over truth issue

. ,‘La.

WASHINGTON — State Depart-
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb
resigned Wednesday to protest the

_apparent U.S. disinformation cam-

paign against ‘Libyan leader Moam-
mar Gadhafi.

Earlier in the week, reports sur-
faced that claimed President Reagan
may have lied to the American press
in order to confuse Gadhafi.

”Faith in the word of America is the
pulse-beat of our democracy," said
Kalb at a news conference. ”Any—
thing that hurts Americafs credibili-
ty, hurts America.”

President -Reagan and Secretary of

' State George Shultz both denied they

lied about anything, and both ex-
pressed sorrow about Kalb’s resig-
nation.

Kalb was careful however not to
confirm that a disinformation pro-
gram did exist, insisting instead his
resignation was because of
”widespread reports” of disinfor-
mation.

”You face a choice as an
American, as a spokesman and as a
jouinalist, whether to allow [your]self
to be absorbed into the ranks of
silence, whether to vanish into unop-
posed acquiescence or to enter a ‘
modest dissent.” Kalb said.

American chemist
defects to Russia

Moscow — Soviet officials said
Thursday that an American chemist
who specializes in cancer research at
a Houston hospital has defected to
the Soviet Union and has been
granted asylum.

According to Tass, Arnold
Lockshin, 47, defected after claiming
he was politically persecuted in the
United States.

A White House spokesman said
Lockshin had not formally renounced
his U.S. citizenship, and he will not
be considered a defector until he
does so. _

”We were blackmailed on the
telephone, our children were
threatened, and we received
anonymous letters in which we were
accused of treachery,” Lockshin
allegedly told Tass. ’

talks, and he does not plan to in-
troduce new arms proposals at his
meeting this weekend with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The official also said the president
probably would let the U.S. military
arsenal of strategic arms exceed the
limit of the SALT II treaty before
another summit could take place.
Reagan has gone on record as saying
the United States should no longer
abide by SALT ll because the Soviets
aren't abiding by it. V

Only a "dramatic change in Soviet
arms control proposals" could make
the president change his mind, the of-
ficial said.

President Reagan also attacked
House democrats Thursday, claiming
they are trying to tie his hands before
he heads to Reykjavik for the
weekend meeting.

Reagan would like to see favorable
arms spending bills passed by the
House, which has been uncoopera-
tive so far.

At issue are House provisions at-
tached to a spending bill that would

Crime rate lowest
since October 1973

WASHINGTON — The Justice
Department reported Thursday that
the crime level has dipped to its
lowest point in 13 years.

According to the report, the biggest
drop came in violent crime, with half
a million fewer violent crimes and
thefts occuring in 1985.

The agency said that during 1985,
the robbery rate dropped 11 percent,
and personal crimes (crimes of
violence and theft) declined 4 per-
cent in 1985.

The agency also said the victimiza-
tion rate for robbery continued its
downward trend, with a 1985 rate of
5.1 attacks per 1,000 people. Rapes
were down to 0.7 for every 1,000
women.

Senators probe plane
incident in Nicaragua

WASHINGTON — A Senate panel
is investigating an allegation that
President Reagan is giving his tacit
approval to private U.S. mercenaries
helping Nicaragua’s Contra rebels
battle the country's pro-Soviet San-
dinista regime. 0

Senator Richard Lugar disclosed
the investigation Wednesday and an-
nounced he'll be heading the probe
into the downing of a plane alleged-
ly carrying supplies to the Contras
and the subsequent capture of an
American crewman inside Nicaragua
after the plane crashed.

The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry
announced Thursday that it will
allow U.S. embassy officials to ques-
tion the captured crewman, Eugene
Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis.

The Ministry also said it will return
the bodies of three Americans killed
in the crash.

Meanwhile in the Nicaraguan
capitol of Managua, a spokesman for
President Daniel Ortega announced
Thursday that Hasenfus is a ”de|i—
quent” who will be tried by the
Nicaraguan courts.

  SC B leading student groups

in protest of trustees meeting

By Joe Zeff

Associate Editor

- The Student Government Board
will take part in a divestment
demonstration Tuesday near Forbes
Quadrangle when the board of
trustees is expected to vote on divest-
ment from South Africa at its tri-
annual meeting, SGB member
Monique Simms said.

Simms, the SGB representative on
divestment, said the Black Action
Society, South Africa Coalition and
Pitt fraternities will also take part.
They are hoping to persuade the
trustees to replace their policy of
selective divestment with total
divestment.

”We’re going to go out and have
a little rally and then go into the
meeting peacefully and quietly,”
Simms said .following the SGB
meeting Wednesday. ’’Hopefully,

they will see our signs and vote to
divest. If not, we're just going to have
to take some stronger methods.”

Simms helped organize the divest-
ment rally Wednesday on the
Bigelow Boulevard side of the
William Pitt Union. Board members
expressed disappointment about the
attendance, which campus police
estimated between 250 and 300
people.

’’I was a little bit disappointed with
the turnout,” SGB President Jim
Mumma said, ”but this was the first
rally of its type, and I think it went
over well enough.” .

Board member Melanie Naro said
10 freshmen spent four hours Tues-
day evening telephoning students
about the rally.

’’I thought the rally itself was
good,” said Simms. ”| just wish a.lot
more people would have come.

’’I think this issue is important to

the people and the students, and that
has been shown through notjust this
rally, but everything that's been go-
mg on. It's a continual ‘struggle. We
could have just had five people there,
and we still would have been going
on strong.”

Simms said she was disappointed
that more faculty did not cancel
classes to allow students to attend the
rally. Nonetheless, she said the rally
was successful in that its message was
clearly and . enthusiastically
transmitted. »

”Executives were coming out to
lunch, and we were handing out
paraphernalia about the rally and
they were crunching it up in their
hands or whatever, but they noticed.
it might have been disruptive to
them, but hey, that's what we wanted
to do."

Rallies met with

little’ enthusiasm

The Pitt Divestment Coalition sponsored an anti—apartheid rally on
Wednesday, Oct. 8, which wasn't as well attended as was hoped.
Rumor had it before the event that 4,000 people were expected,‘ but
in the end, an estimated 250 showed up, and that is a generous estima-
tion.

It's a shame that more peopleat Pitt can't find the time to show
concrete support for an issue that the majority of the students, facul-
ty and staff supposedly embrace. The problem is either that the Pitt

. Divestment Coalition doesn't have the support they think they do

or that our community is too apathetic to even try to make a dif-
ference. If the Coalition doesn't have the support, it IS not the Coali-
tion's fau|t..The members work tirelessly to educate and raise

_  . _ consciousness about the issue. More likely, the problem lies with our

community. Pitt people have never been and most likely never will
be willing to stand up for a cause.

‘ The Pitt News suggests that the pro-divestment factions tone down
their emphasis on rallies and instead redirect their energy to more
intense lobbying efforts. It's obvious from Wednesday's rally and the
demonstrations that have preceded it that there aren't enough peo-
ple around here who will stand up and be counted.-

If the Divestment Coalition would rechannel its energy, it could
also avoid fair-weather supporters — people who want to have’a cause
to call their own just for the sake of being rebellious. A smaller number
of people who genuinely understand and are passionate about the
divestment cause can do more to improve the situation in South Africa
than many people who lend little more than moral support and lip-
service.

In order to better serve its cause, the Pitt Divestment Coalition must
re-evaluate its methods. Divestment is a worthy cause, a cause that

"deserves more active support from the community than it's getting.

Rallies work when they are well attended, but when only 250 of an
anticipated 4,000 people show up, the issue IS cheapened.

Misinformation’S
an abhorrent act

According to a memo from National Security Advisorjohn Poindex—
ter that was obtained by the Washington Post, the Reagan administra-
ti<Ln lauched a ”disinformation campaign” regarding the situation in
Li ya. '

The campaign allegedly began on Aug. 14, 1986, and was meant
to step up psychological warfare against Moammar Gadhafi by con-
vincing him that he faced new U.S. bombings and possible coup at-
tempts by his adversaries. White House aids also apparently tried to
convince several news agencies that these manufactured threats to
Gadhafi’s power were real.

The majority of the American people didn't and still don't realize
what went on. The disinformation campaign wasn't meant to affect
us; it was supposed to make Gadhafi nervous. So the American peo-
ple weren’t directly harmed. Underneath the surface of this issue,
however, we were. The Reagan administration is going to have to
try very hard to live this one down.

The disinformation campaign has greatly harmed Reagan's credibili-
ty. The man who constantly accuses the Soviets of misinforming the
world has turned around and done the same thing. Propaganda is
nothing new. Reagan is a master of it. Only this time he was caught.
Presidential aids and Secretary of State George Shultz have been try-
ing desperately to cover for the presidential blunder. It's not work-
ing, though. ~

Instead of unsettling Gadhafi, we've strengthened him. We tried
to make him look like a fool, but the tables ended up turning, and
now we're the ones with the red faces. In the future, the Reagan ad-
ministration should let the Soviet Union be the one who deliberate-
ly misinforms, unless of course, our actions are bad enough to merit
masks. If that is the case, it's time for a new president.

Financial aid cuts

Student aid is a topic of major con-
cern for college students throughout
the United States. Sitting around
waiting for that little yellow computer
form from the Financial Aid Office is
difficult enough; but opening the let-

ter and finding that you have not '

been awarded enough aid is a dif-
ficult and too-often repeated realiza-
tion of students at Pitt. As shown,
however,.by the Oct. 8 issue of The
Pitt News, Mr. Donald Frazier of the
Black Action Society does not see this
as a universal problem.

According to [Mr.] Frazier, ”Pitt is
not placing enough importance on
financial aid problems of its black
students.” There is no mention of
white, yellow or any other color
students, just black students. Let me
inform you, sir, that this is not just
your problem. There are students of
all ages and races who are not get-
ting enough aid to continue their

education. I myself fought with the

Student Aid Office to recognize the
fact that my father had retired and
that we lost our prime source of in-
come. With perseverance and six
months of yelling and screaming, I
finally got my point across, and my
aid was awarded.

Unfortunately, many people are
not as lucky. A number of my friends
(black, white “and Hispanic) were
unable to come back to Pitt over the
last three years because they could
not receive the aid that they needed.
They were not athletes but students
with a "simple desire to obtain a high
degree of knowledge.” They are’ now
at home working instead of continu-
ing their education.

What I am trying to say, Mr.
Frazier, is that you have been too nar-
row in your views on retaining
students. The financial aid policy is
simple: If you or your parents have
earned too much money, you will be
denied student aid. Period. That's not
just blacks or Hispanics or even
South Africans; it's everyone. Either
you made enough money to pay for
college, or you didn't. If there comes
a day when black students are afford-
ed more financial aid because they
are black, I shall have to cry ”discrim-
ination!” Ifyou succeed in disrupting
the equality of the present financial
aid situation, then you will be a
hypocrite to the cause of equality for
all (if indeed that is the cause for
which you are fighting).

The Black Action Society made the
front page again. It seems black
students are having trouble getting
financial ‘aid. First of all, let me state

[that] I am not prejudiced. I only want
to know why the BAS thinks black
students deserve financial aid more
than any other minority or whites.
Funny, I neverrealized there were
two financial aid forms, one for
whites and one for blacks, each with
[its] own qualifications. I thought
financial aid was based on need.
There are many whites also struggling
to pay tuition. Some go into the mil-
itary before enrolling in college,
while others are forced to drop out
for a term or a year to work. The BAS
says that they want equality, but they
are asking for preferential treatment.

. Collegiate militarism

I may be just a faded relic of the
'60s, and maybe the notion —— unfor-
tunate and unfounded as it may be
— of the '60s as something best
forgotten will permit many readers to
dismiss me quickly, but whatever I
am, I am disturbed at the wayatimes
have changed when a photograph
displaying ROTC ”war maneuvers on
Flagstaff Hill” is displayed centrally
in a university newspaper with no ap-
parent chagrin or purposeful irony.
Has American militarism become so
embedded in the fabric of our lives
in the age of Reagan that we no
longer even stop to question?

The timing could hardly have been
more ironically auspicious, though I
wonder if anyone noticed. And is that
voice-in-the-wilderness feeling I have
only my '60s paranoic counter-
culturist neurosis locking me in a
time warp? Ah, how I long forithat
golden age, the seemingly irretriev-
able, socially conscious ’60s. But
nevertheless, neurotic or not, I could
not help being struck, as if with Max-
well’s silver hammer, that on. this
very day, Pitt's ”be all that you can
be” best were photographically
displayed gazing intently upon the in-
nards and _outards of an Army
helicopter. (Oh, dreaded doom-
bringing ghosts of Vietnam, hear my
cry!) On that very day, indeed, the
Nicaraguan army downed a C-123,
killing two Americans, and our presi-

dent said— he really did — that they -—

had absolutely nothing to do with our
government. Absolutely nothing. "
Somebody said that Hegel said that
what we learn from history is that we
don't learn from history. When the

Positive views!

As of late, I feel like all of our com-
ments to the editor are on a negative
note. Well, this section is for positive
views, too.

I would like to commend all of the
Pitt students who stayed to the bitter
(and I mean bitter) end of the game
last Saturday and cheered the, team
on. Also, thank you to The Pitt News
for such quick and accurate reporting
on the game situation. Win or lose,
this is the kind of pride and backing
athletes need to give them the add-
ed sense of drive to do well and make
us a spirited school. This is something
the cheerleaders and" Golden Girls

help us with when we cooperate and --
, participate along with them. Good

point, G.B. Patterson, in your article
on Oct. 6.

As for the racial issue involving fans
who attend the games, I am aware of
the ”first come, first serve” basis of
seating. Anyone can arrive early to
reserve seats so that [he] will be able
to sit with [his] friends, whether they
are black or white. As for the frater-
nity I saved seats for at this particular
game, it is simply a matter of tradi-
tion. I do not think seating is a valid
way to analyze the composition of
people at the games. If blacks con-
stitute 8 percent of Pitt's population,
perhaps this is why they make up a
similar ratio at the stadium. I am of-
fended and confused when [people]
(black, Jewish, gay, frat member or
any other minority —— we are all part
of a minority) ‘demand equal rights in
the same sentence that they refer to
themselves as ’’our people’’ or ”my
people" (Lee Po|ansky’s letter on
Oct. 3). Ifwe are going to live as one
people, we have to believe we are all
one people and stop just talking
about it.

I love Pitt. Let's make it so that we
can all love Pitt together — enough
of finding faults.

THE PITT News, Friday, October 10, 1986

WPTS: Two full years of progressive FM at Pitt

WPTS is an educational, non-
commercial FM station owned
by the University of Pittsburgh
and operated as a student
organization. The station was
founded in l96l as WPGH and
broadcasted to the Pitt and
Carlow campuses via carrier-
current transmission.

ln i963, the Litchfield Towers
were built, and the potential au-
dience doubled. The early sta-
tion was a vital element in the
active Pitt community, ushering in
the era of psychedelia and
metal. Traditions such as

”Spring Fling” and Panther
Basketball were begun at this

time. There were fun things, like
a 72-hour music marathon in the
Towers Lobby and raising
money for Children's Hospital.
The station was the first to help
out the Press Old Newsboys
Fund. There were also serious
things, like broadcasting draft-
lottery numbers during the Viet-
nam War.

In T972, the university filed for
an FM license. ln the crowded
Pittsburgh market, the non-
commercial band would have to
be rearranged to accommodate
another station. The conflicts
arose between Carnegie_

I Affordable Floors will GDPGOT 0* 31'"/Tday Bash ”- A

Mellon's WRCT and Bethany
College's WVBC. WRCT would
have to move to 88.7 and
WPGH would take 88.l on the
FM band. Since WVBC is at
88. l , it would have interfered.
Thus, to alleviate these problems
and since WRCT would not
relocate, the FCC granted per-
mission for the new WPTS to
broadcast at 98.5 mHz with a
power of lO watts from atop the

Cathedral of Learning — the last .
’ lO watt station ever licensed.

WPTS went on the air official-
ly at 6 p.m. on Aug. 26, T984.
Station manager K.J. Jones in-
troduced WPTS to the people of

  

Pittsburgh, and program director
Chris Kramer did the first airshift.
The first song played was
”There's Something Going On”
by Frida.

Since then, WPTS has made
leaps and bounds in the Pitts-
burgh radio market, introducing
new music to the city and affect-
ing how various stations in Pitts-

*burgh program and format. ,

WPTS remains today an in-
tegral part of the university. lt
provides a professional working
environment for students in-
terested in every aspect of radio

.gram

 

broadcasting. lt’s now time to

celebrate a second year of pro-
gress at WPTS.

This evening, WPTS will be

Nov. 3, at 8 p.m. is titled Toten-
fanz or Dance of Death. The
concert, which is being per
formed at The Church of the
Ascension in Shadyside, will ex-
plore the varied aspects and
musical interpretations of death,
from serenity to terror to ecstasy.
The program includes "Motet
No.5; Komm, Jesu, Komm" by
J.S. Bach; Hugh Distler's
”Totentanz,Upus 5 No. 2;"

 

ANNOUNCES THE

_C_“

The Sponges and Billy Mancini.
It will be held in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room with an:
admission of S5 at the door. All‘
are welcome.

”Apparebit Repenta Dies” by
Paul Hindemith and three
American spirituals by Alice
Parker. The performance will in-
clude the Pittsburgh Brass
Quintet and additional brass
ensemble and organ accom-
paniment.

The decision to devote an en- ’

tire concert to musical treatments

of death was inspired primarily ._

by the extraordinary scope and‘

variety of this genre, both“

musically and philosophically.
. ”lt is universal and in-
evitable,” says music director
and conductor Max Peterson.
"When we are confronted with
death, mostof‘ us experience
feelings of morbidity and sor-
row, fear and bereavement. But
when the idea of death is ex-
pressed through art, literature
and music, specific philosophical
perceptions of death emerge. ln
the Bach Motet, ’Komm, Jesu,
Komm,’ for example, the fact of
dying is perceived as the attain- '
ment of a goal rather than the
end of life." The Hindemith

”Apparebit" interprets the ar- ,

chetypal "Day of Wrath."
”Totentanz" by Hugo Distler
covers a wide spectrum of emo-
tional response, employing
seven actors in addition to the
lOO-voice cho_ir. Tickets for A
”Totentanz" are $8; _'senior
citizen and student tickets are $6
and are available at the door or

by calling 682—BACH. ‘

Louie aims to
reconcile illusions

By Susan Washburn

We wi// serenade our Louie
W/ii/e life and voice shall /ast
Then we'// pass and be forgot-
ten with the rest.

— The Wiffenpoof...Song

Serenading Louie is one of the
most emotionally grueling scripts
in today's th.eatrical drama. The
author, Lanford Wilson, follows
two modern couples through
their struggles to discover what
they view as life's priorities. Both
marriages have reached a criti-
cal point, the time that deter-
mines what path their future lives
will take. Alex and Gabby are
attempting to understand the
changes that have occurred in
their relationship. Alex worries
more about his career than his
wife, and Gabby desperately
reaches out for some affection
from her husband. Gabby re-
gards sex as confirmation of his
love; but Gabby-'s continuous
come-ons threaten Alex. The
couplemust either learn to find
a compromise or end the mar-
riage and find a satisfying rela-
tionship elsewhere. .

Peter Webster portrays the
upwardly mobile Alex. Wearing
loafers and conservative ties,
Webster conveys Alex's ideal-
ism with enthusiasm. As the pro-
fessional, Webster excels. His
performance as an indifferent
husbandis not quite as convinc-
ing; he doesn't appear as no-
tural and comfortable in such a
role.’ Alex's wife Gabby is
played by Helena Ruoti. Ruoti
competently uses her face as a
tool throughout the entire show.
As Gabby attempts to illicit some
type "of response from her hus-
band, all the frustration and pain
are evident on her face. The
script, which could be difficult to
understand because of the
fragmented sentences and
thoughts Gabby verbalizes, is
immediately comprehended be-
cause of Ruoti's secure grasp of
the character. She also does
Gabby credit in the scene in
which she decides to leave her

husband, giving Gabby a depth
and stability that earns her
respect from the audience.

The other couple, Carl and
Mary, experience a different
type of crisis in their relationship.
Carl knows that Mary is having
an affair with his accountant and
decides that it will pass.

Their relationship at home is
perceived to be relatively stable
and loving compared to that of
Alex and Gabby. There are no
fights or frustrations evident un-
til’Carl confronts Mary. He does
not accept the ending of the
relationship with the quiet
resentment that Gabby and Alex
do. Carl is passionate and
violent. It is the passion and
violence that eventually destroy
his family life.

Thomas A. Stewart is awe-
some as Carl. Throughout the
show he reveals the silent
volcano burning inside of Carl
and quietly exposes the true
potential of his final explosion.
His performance is very disci-
plined. He knows how much to
give and when. This is a compli-
ment to bothhim and the direc-
tor, since it is the director-who
regulates the tone of the show.
Catherine Butterfield portrays
Mary, the former homecoming
queen. Butterfield bounces

about the stage with all of the '

vivacity of a sorority girl. Her
energy is contagious and her
abilities evident as Mary and
Carl bring to light the problems
in their relationship. She is

dynamic and competent as,‘

Mary.

‘Overall, the Pittsburgh Public
Theater's production of Ser-
enading Louie is expertly cast
and powerfully done. The cast
consists of four professionals
who immerse themselves com-
pletely into the characters giving
the audience a glimpse of four
people attempting to reconcile
themselves with life's illusions.

By Melissa Divack

The black, smoked glass of the
Peking Royal Kitchen stands out
among the busy storefronts on
lower Murray Avenue. This
aesthetic frontage effectively
suggests that something special
lies inside. For authentic Chinese
cuisine in an intimate setting, the
Kitchen is an excellent choice.

The interior of the Kitchen, a
studio style,_ is simple and
tasteful, carefully avoiding a
contrived atmosphere. A few let-
ters to the owner and chef, Ber-
nard Yan , hang among the
traditionaT art, providing a

-welcome, personal touch.

of hot tea are quickly proffered.

unusual, such as baby squid with
ginger or spicy Kung Pao dishes,
claimed to be the hottest in Pitts-
burgh. Four styles of Chinese
cooking are represented on the
menu, including the classic Pek-
ing style, the spicy Sichuan style,
the sweeter Shanghai dishes
and the stir—fried Cantonese
dishes. It is best to come when
you are really hungry; a dinner
consisting of soup, appetizer
and main dish proves to be a
tremendous meal.

The tangy hot and Sour soup

both quite good, but the

been marinated in mud (shelled)

here on campus, and when both
of these bands puts out a brand-
spanking new album at the same
time, the news is bound to cause
a stir. But is this new stuff really
worth making a fuss about? Or,
to phrase the question different-
ly, are these records really
worth listening to? _

Let's talk about the Human
League. Their latest album,
Crash, is just about what you'd
expect from‘ a new Human
League album. And that's not
necessarily bad. They have

group), and this record does lit-

disco—bop tune, complete with a
droning bass line and repetitive
synthesizer blips. Closing the first
side is "Are You Ever Coming
Back?/' a haunting but very ap-
pealing song that is reminiscent

A of l98l 's Dare.

The second side of Crash is
like one extra-long, remixed and

extended, disco—dance single.’

The first song, called ''I Need
Your Loving,” is a shallow one,
with synthesizer noises and

"backing vocals that suggest

always been sort of flashy disco’

Midnight Star or Ollie and Jerry.
"Party" and "Love on the Run"
are more of the same and equal-
ly shallow. These songs are
perfect for be-bopping, but
forget it if you're lookingfor
meaningful lyrical content. "The
Real Thing" is a little different,
though. You could certainly
dance to it, but it seems more in-
tense, and it is indeed much
more enjoyable. This song re-
calls "Fascination," and what
could be better than that? Last-
ly, "Love is All That Matters" is
a slightly more mellow, sen-
timental piece that simply sails to
the end of the album.

The Pacific Age, the new
record from new-wave-slash-
synth—pop monsters Orchestral
Manoeuvres in the Dark, is a bit

blematic record.

The songs rooted in reality
propel Fishbone to their greatest
heights. "ln The Air" works as
a funky update of Dylan's
"Blowin' ln The Wind" with
drugs and riches listed as just
two of the diversions that keep
people from finding answers in

life. "Movement ln The Light"'

has anelegant sophistication in
its slow, bluesy music and in its
metaphorical lyrics on one man
and one woman coming togeth-
er despite problems and reser-

of a letdown for die-hard fans.
lt's just too accessible. It seems
to be meant that way, though.
Andy McCluske and Paul Hum-
phreys probably just decided
that it was about time to start
making some money. We can't
deny them that after all this time.

The album begins with "Stay
(The Black Rose and the Univer-
sal Wheel)," a fast-paced and
energetic plea for us to listen to
the rest of the record. Next is the
single "(Forever) Live and Die,"
a sickeningly sweet Top—4O
number that would be more ap-
propriate on the Pretty in Pink
soundtrack.along with "lf You
Leave.” But it gets better. The ti-
tle track, "The Pacific Age,”
sounds more like the O.M.D. we
know and love. lt has a majestic
quality that remembers "The
Native Daughters of the Golden
West," from Cru’sh. "The Dead
Girls” really does sound like a
death march, complete ‘with
angelic female backing vocals.
And "Shame" ends side one,
with Andy McCluskey's voice
smoothly serenading us amidst a
quaint piano-accented melody.

"Southern" starts side two on
a strange note. This song is
literally nothing but blaring
trumpets, throbbing percussion

vations. ''Give It Up" is a
joyous, celebratory song of
togetherness that accentuates
the theme of "Movement."
But amongst some of their
finest works, we find some of
FishbOne's worst. While songs
like "A Selection" are fun and
typical of the 'BOne's upbeat,
‘quirky, ska-flavored work, many
lackthe fire of the band's earlier

"songs like "Skankin' To The

Beat" and "Ugly". Other songs
are just bad; "Knock lt" is an
uninspired narrative on mastur-

and Star Trek-esque arias
underneath recordings of Martin
Luther King Jr. Althou h it's a
nice idea, and it definiteTy has an
important message to get
across, it gets a little boring.
Next is "Flame of Hope," a
disconcertingly pleasant song
that, once again, features
McClusky's smooth, smooth
vocals. "Goddess of Love" is
classic O.M.D., recalling "Enola

"Hard Day," from Jun/< Cu/ture.
"We Love You" rants about go-

upbeat, very danceable synth

Both the Human League and

well-respected recording artists,

 SHOWCASE 

 

 

Every Miles" Davis album since
l97l has had the unenviable
task of living up to the rich
legacy of work this chameleon
has presented in the last 40
years. But here in l986, if his
playing has lost any of the
torque of grace and finesse, then
the continually redefined edge
he gives to his music only
becomes sharper. ln short, he
plays his ass off when he's
serious, and even in the con-
siderable amount of time he
spends "noodling," he excels.
Miles’ first album for the Warner
Brothers label might pale next to
any of his superior sides from the
early '50s to the late '60s, but

tion. Perhaps an even more ac-
curate summation would be like
hearing a David Sanborn record

David Sanborn. This is due to the
considerably overwhelming
presence of bassist extraor-
dinaire, Marcus Miller. Miller,
who's best known for his shim-
mering production work with
Sanborn and Luther Vandross,
exerts a technological radiance
and slick resilience which
spawns funky thoughts of some

‘sort of ”electro-iazz—noir." The

credited to Miller, who seems to
have filled the shoes of Miles’

Miller a lot of space on Tutu,

fortable in a recorded ensemble
since the '70s. Admittedly, this
is ‘a weird confession due to the
lack of human input on Tutu (yes,
electric drum ' patterns sound
cool, but rhythm is a human
function, not a programming
talent), yet it does work.

The songs range from typical
urban funk to thoroughly
fascinating fusion. This latter

category plays around with its‘

own form on Tutu by fusing
elements like electro—pop and
blues as well as funk and flamen-
co. "Tutu'_' and "Don't Lose

Your Mind" are the album's
strongest songs. In addition,
they face the ongoing challenge
of redefining the limits of music.
Likewise, these two songs were
Miles’ strongest concert pieces
at his performance in the Pitts-
burgh Jazz Festival this past
summer. ”Tutu" takes an Africdn
structure which_supposes a blues
motif. The two knit so perfectly
together beneath the definitive

trumpet lines that we have Miles .

paying beautiful homage to the
man he speaks of. "Don't Lose
Your Mind," on the other hand,
takes a basic reggae structure
and forms a tribal chant over top
with some elements of blues,
jazz and Africana to create a
hypnotic burning force to be
reckoned with. Miles gets down.
"Backyard Ritual," though, ‘is a
curious rewrite of last year's se-
quel tune "M.D. l" from You're
Under Arrest. Here it's longer
and somewhat crisper but just as
utterly pointless. "Splatch" and
"Full Nelson" are your basic
throw-away funk stompers with
an unadulterated groover and a
penchant for thoughtlessness.
"Portia," with its flamenco flair,
is the closest Tutucomes to jazz
and, perhaps, the closest it gets
to Muzak. "Perfect Way" is a
catchy and precise rendition of
that Scritti Politti classic;
remember when a cover tune for
Miles meant something like "My
Funny Valentine"? Regardless,
"Tutu" and "Don't Lose Your
Mind" are very good and highly
recommended; the rest all seems
somehow to be filler. lntriguing
filler music, yes, but filler none
the less.

In almost all regards, Tutu is an

improvement over last year's
You're Under Arrest and Decoy
from l984. There is a refined
approach to the electronics
which are in accordance with
Miles’ theories of the silences
contributing to the effect of the
score. Miles seems to be saying
a lot more here than he has
elsewhere in recent years, but
his manner of speaking is still a
little unclear to me. While l never
disliked Tutu, l’d prefer to hear
Miles more in focus, following a
direction he understands; not
necessarily in his accompani-
ment, which is usually impec-
cable, but in his own approach.
Frankly, l prefer a lot less ofthe
mute; only part of a solo in
”Don't Lose Your Mind” was
without a mute and it was a
glorious relief. Tutu is good post-
Bitches Brew, but not great.

Finally, while the list of musi-
cians who contribute to Tutu is
brief, thanks to synths and over-
dubs, there is a glaring credit‘
omission. Occasionally, some
sax player does some nice spar-
ring with Miles. l’d hate to think
the sax is the product of a syn-

thesizer, but who coul'd this

mystery man be? Tutu is basical-
ly a duet between Miles and

Marcus Mil_ler with some work

by keyboardist George Duke
and violinist Michael Urbaniak,
but who plays sax here?

This record won't change your
mind about Miles Davis. lf you
still long for King OtB/ue or even

ably going to disregard Tutu
anyway. However, if you want

A tale of two strggling tams

By Thomas‘ Danyluk

Sta ff Writer

Listen up, gentlemen. Now I know
how tough last week's loss was to
swallow. We played hard, but not
hard enough to win. You guys know
that as well as I do. We're a much
better football team than we showed
last Saturday. One game doesn't
make the season because they’re all
important, but it's starting to getlate,
especially for you seniors. Now lets
go out there and make the fans proud
and show ’em we know how to play
the game of football!

Hmmm. From which collegiate
locker room could this rousing pep
serenade possiblybe blaring? How
about Notre Dame for starters?
Sounds reasonable. Lou Ho|tz’s Irish
dropped last Saturday's matchup with
Alabama 28-10 and thus have lost

three of their first four 1986 outings. -

If Notre Dame is going to luck
themselves into a Bowl appearance,
they'd better start banging some
heads and quit romancing the
Blarney stone that the media has dug
up for the new Holtzian era.

Well, what about their opponent
for this week, the University of Pitts-
burgh? Indeed, another good can-
didate. The 2-2-1 Panthers literally let
a game slide out of their hands a-
gainst Temple last week at Pitt
Stadium.

They blew a game that they were
never supposed to lose, and with
Notre Dame, Miami and Penn State
waiting on distant battlefields, post-
season travel doesn't seem too like-
ly for Pitt. But for both schools, pride
and alumni bragging rights are
always at stake.

The present versions of "these two
stumbling schools are remarkably
similar. In 1985, the Irish and Pan-
thers were guided to respective 5-6
and 5-5-1 records. Five whole wins?

This is a likely characteristic of the
average Michigan State or Texas
A&M squads, but it is surely not ac-
ceptable for lofty Pitt or Notre Dame.
Several previous seasons had also
been rather bleak for the two, so
former Irish coach Gerry Faust and
Panther head man Foge Fazio were
sent packing.

Pitt tennis

Staff Writer 1

The Pitt women's tennis team
crushed Slippery Rock University 9-0
at Trees Hall on Wednesday.

This win is especially significant to
the team because last year it was
beaten by Slippery Rock in a close
match 3-6.

The Lady Panthers’ season record
now stands at 6-3. With three match-
es remaining againsttough schools
such as West Liberty, West Virginia
and Ohio University, the team has
not yet secured a winning season.
The Panthers need to win at least one
of the three remaining matches to do
that, and with the new momentum
that the team has found, it shouldn't
be a problem.

Leading the Pitt team to the shutout
victory over Slippery Rock was senior
Jodi Levine who played No. 1
singles. ' Levine played her usual
brand of dominating tennis, beating
opponent Amy Tocco in two straight
sets 6-0, 6-2.

Winningsingles matches is nothing
new to Levine. Her singles record for
this season is 7-2. ’’I felt confident out
on the court. We have been drilling

the field, are dubbing 1986 the Re-
zoning Year — for now we're gonna
make some big changes and whip
some folks into line, but look out for
us real soon ’cause we'll be coming
at ya.

When these teams are settled com-
fortably into the frameworks laid by

-their respective leaders, the Top 20

will have two nasty claim jumpers on
their hands.

The personnel of these two teams
match up well also, with both clubs
enjoying the return of 13 starters. At
quarterback for the Irish, senior Steve
Beuerlien runs the show. ”Beuer|ien
is a good quarterback. He's got a_
strong arm,” said Gottfried. ”He’s a
great leader, but I'm also impressed
with [Terry] Andrysiak, his backup.
He has also performed very well for
them.” Pitt contends with fifth-year
senior John Congemi, who sparked
a 21-16 victory over Notre Dame in
1983. He’ll be looking to improve on
last week's 13 of 26 passing perform-
ance in Pitt Stadium.

Defensively, Notre Dame boasts
the strength of their line, anchored by
the mammoth Wally Klein (6-9, 274).
The tough Irish secondary starts three
seniors and a junior who don't take
kindly to enemy receivers playing
catch in their jurisdiction. LB Mike
Kovaleski is the class of the defense,
pacing the team with 38 tackles. Pitt's
excellent offensive line could have
their problems resisting this senior-
laden outfit.

The Panthers, meanwhile, will
need to send everyone, especially
pass rusher-extraordinaire Tony
Woods, full steam ahead into
Beuerlienfs pocket. John Fox, Pitt's
defensive coordinator, remarked,
”Steve’s a classic example of the
drop-back passer. Last week we faced
a different style of quarterback in
[Lee] Saltz — more of a scrappy,
Congemi—style player. Beuerlien
won't run much, so we'll have to
pressure him, make him hurry his
passes.”

The Panther secondary is again
healthy and far from being battle-shy.
Pitt's DB5 held Saltz to 152 yards
through the air and expect similar
success against the Irish quarterback.
”Beuerlien can get hot and make it
a long day for us,” warned Fox, ”but

I think we'll-be ready for him.”

still need more work on my volley,
though.”

Freshman Tracy Feltingoff was
equally impressive in her match. She
played a very aggresive net game and
defeated Lisa Howe of Slippery Rock
6-3, 6-2.

”My timing was good today, and
I was hitting well. As the season pro-
gresses, I feel more relaxed on the
courts,” said Feltingoff.

Lady Panther, junior Stephanie
Nelson is a strong No. 3 singles
player who has won consistently this
year. Nelson won easily over Dawn
Carlson from the Slippery Rock squad
in two sets 6-1, 6-2.

Nelson is starting to prepare men-
tally for the Big East Championships
to be held later this month. ”As a
team, we have to get psyhed for the
Big East,” said Nelson. ”Because the
competition is so tough, we have to
be mentally tough and play ag-
gressively. In the Big East Champion-
ships you can't afford to make
mistakes, or you'll be off the court
fast.”

match because her family attended to
cheer her on. ”I was very patient in
the match, and I served well,” said
DeVera. ”I hope to improve my fore-
hand asthe season progresses. I think
Slippery Rock was a little weaker this
year, and we were a lot stronger.”

Lady Panther sophomore Bonnie
Kartzman made a strong showing in
the No. 5 singles match. She sound-
ly beat Yoko Inone of Slippery Rock
6-1, 6-0. ‘

Kartzman is a first-year player and
is expected to improve even more as
the season continues. ”I played more
aggressively today than I have been.
I think I was kind of tentative at the
start of the season, but as I played
more, I became more experienced
and felt more relaxed,” said Kartz-
man. ”Knowing we're playing against
tough teams makes me more excited
for the matches. We've been practic-
ing hard, and I think that will help us
when we face the tough teams re-
maining on our schedule.”

Sophomore Karen Meade played

’’I was frustrated from losing the tie

mented Meade. ”I was tired and lost
my concentration for a while, but
then after talking to Coach Dieffen-

”I think we have a strong, team-

”When we play, we focus on the

The positive momentum the team
gained from the singles matches car-
ried over to the doubles matches,
where the results were equally im-

pressive. The Lady Panthers rolled

over Slippery Rock 3-0 in the doubles
to make the shut-out
complete.

Levine and Feltingoff played
smoothly together, defeating Tocco

doubles team 6-0, 6-4.

Kartzman and Meade playing No. 3
doubles for the Panthers. They
defeated Inone and Stevens of the
Slippery Rock doubles team in three
sets 7-6, 2-6, 7-6. '

It is initially difficult for a doubles
team to get accustomed to playing
with each other. "I knew one of these
days it would come together for Bon-
nie and I, and we would start play-
ing better together,” Meade
commented. ”In this match, it hap- '
pened. Now we will concentrate on

becoming mentally tough for the Big ,

Coach George Dieffenbach was
pleased with the outcome of the
match’. ”This was a good turn-around
for the team after being beaten by the
same team last year. The team really
pulled together to beat a tough
team," said Dieffenbach. ”This

Sometimes catching the opponent
off guard is the best thing a team can

_ strive for. Before the i_nital shock has

worn off, hopefully things will fall in-
to place, and the win will be secured.

If St. Francis, Seton Hall or
Youngstown State wants to beat the
Lady Panthers, they'll have to throw
the Lady Panthers off balance early.

Pitt, 13-5 overall and 6-0 in the Big

East, hoststhe Pitt Invitational tonight
and Saturday with the championship
match set for tomorrow at 8 p.m.
Facing a combined record of seven
wins and 43 losses, the Lady Panthers
have the definite edge. Though Pitt
is comfortably in first place in con-
ference play, they need to pick up
these four wins — two conference
victories over Seton Hall - if they ex-
pect to continue the calibre of

' volleyball they have been playing.

With St. Francis 2-17, Seton Hall
4-19 and Youngstown State 1-7, Pitt
is the strongest team in the field. Lady
Panther senior captain Sue Hoover
agrees. ”We still need to play our
best. It is important to maintain our
[playing] level,” said Hoover. ”We
can't allow ourselves to be taken out
of our game and put into theirs.”

’.’We’re expected to be the
strongest team at the tournament,”

commented Pitt coach Shelton Col-
lier. ”While we're not overlooking it
[the tournament], we are looking
ahead to the Kentucky and Penn State
matches next weekend.

”This tournament will be used to
prepare us for some of our major
long-term goals. Our players should
use these three or four matches to im-
prove their game.”

The Lady Panthers are the first-
place favorite heading into the Pitt In-
vitational, even though the ”home
court advantage" is not a real con-
crete one for Pitt. Coach Collier ex-
plained, ”It’s vitally important that we
play great volleyball every time we
play in the field house. If we play up
to our ability, it will help us to
establish ‘greatness.’ The home court
advantage is a limited one. We prac-
tice in Trees Hall, and we have to

readjust to the field house every time .

we play there. If we continue our
winning trend in the field house this
weekend, we should maintain that
slight ’home court advantage.’ ”
The Lady Panthers will host the
University of Kentucky Wildcats next
Friday at 7 p.m. and Penn State Sun-
day at 7:30 p.m. Both teams are na-
tionally ranked and should provide
some stiff competition for Pitt. The
Nittany Lions defeated Pitt earlier this
season at the Villanova Classic.

Pitt can't break WVU jinx

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team hasn't beaten
the Mountaineers from West Virginia
in over 10 years, and that streak con-
tinued Wednesday night as the Pan-
thers were handed a 2-0 loss in front
of a larger-than-usual Pitt Stadium
crowd. ' _ ’

”Thé effort was there,” said Pitt
coach Joe Luxbacher. ”We just didn't
play well. Some key players got out
of their game, and that really hurt."

At the beginning of the first half, the
Pitt players came out with fi re in their
eyes. With less than a minute gone
in the game, Pitt worked'the‘ball
through the Mountaineer defense. It
took a great save by West Virginia
goaltender Brian Hartlove to stop a
shot by Pitt junior David Moss to
keep the game scoreless. It then
turned into a defensive battle.

West Virginia took a couple of long
shots on goal, but none were really
serious. Then with 32:03 left in the
first half, the WVU defense broke

down, and Pitt freshman Bryan Ham-
mond had an open goal in front of
him. But Hartlove somehow closed
the gap, and it remained 0-0.
Hammond was one of the few Pan-

thers who impressed his coach.
”Brian Hammond was the only guy
who kept his composure,” said Lux-
bacher. ”He didn't get caught up in
all the talk. I wish I could have found
11 guys like that.”

The Pitt defense started to fall apart
at this point, and the offense did a
disappearing act. With 26:50 left in

‘the half, Pitt made what could have

been a serious mistake. Mountaineer
Theirno Niang picked up a loose ball
deep inside the Panther territory. All
he had to do was beat goalie Mark
Hendricks for an easy score. He
found out that this is not an easy thing
to do, as Hendricks made a nice, div-
ing save to keep the game tied.

The rest of the first half was spent
on the Panther side of the field, but
there were no serious scoringthreats.
The score at the half was 0-0’.

The start of the second half was a
continuation of the first. The WVU
defense became like a wall and re-
pelled the Panther offense time and
again. ”We lost our composure,”
said Pitt junior John Sykes. ”We
played their game.”

The play of Hendricks in goal was
the only thing that kept the game
from becoming a blowout. With
40:03 left in the game, Mountaineer
Jefferey Leonardo put the ball past

Hendricks to make the score 1-0. ‘

”We were really psyched for this
game," said Mountaineer Steve
Schreiner. ”When we scored the first
goal, it just got us higher. I guess we
were just sick of losing.”

Although there was a lot of time left
in the game, Pitt could not muster
much of an attack. Every time they
got in close, a bad 'pass or a mental
mistake stopped them. The final nail
in the coffin came with 15:47 leftin
the game. Niang put the ball in the
back of the goal, and WVU had a
commanding 2-0 lead. ”It was a
tough game, but we played very
well,” said West Virginia coach John
McGrath. ”This is a happy time. Any
time a team from West Virginia can
beat a team‘from Pitt is a time to
remember. We just wanted it more.”

The rest of the game was a defen-
sive battle as neither team put on
much of a scoring threat. The game
ended with the scoreboard showing
2-0. ”We played really flat," said Pitt
senior Joe Triglia. ”We couldn't do
anything right.”

Pitt will put its 7-1-1 record up
against Big\East rival Seton Hall on
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. Game time
is 7:15 p.m. ”We’l| have to pick up
after this loss,” said Luxbacher.
”Seton Hall is a much better team.”

Pitt and Notre Dame, two of the
most illustrious schools in college
football history, will play tomorrow
afternoon in a regionally televised
game at Notre Dame Stadium.

There is one problem: nobody
cares.

With the exception of fans of the
Fighting Irish and the Panthers, peo-
ple across the country do not par-
ticularly give a hoot who wins this
game.

This column isn't intended to slight,

Pitt's or Notre Dame's football pro-
grams, but rather to face facts.
Mainly, the fact is that these two
once-proud schools are both in very
difficult transition periods right now.
Notre Dame is 1-3 under Lou
Holtz, an exceptional coach who has
turned programs around at North
Carolina State, Arkansas and Min-
nesota. But it isn't easy for him to
erase the losing attitudes that the Irish
players developed under the inept
Gerry Faust, who compiled a medi-

Irish

Continued from page 13
The offenses are unpredictable in

the sense that it's tough to judge what —

will come out of their anything-goes
grab bag of plays. Holtz is known for
his varied, effectual game plans. Said
Gottfried of his counter—strategist,
”With Holtz, Notre Dame shows a

S lot of different formations, a lot of dif-

ferent sets. They have guys shifting
around all the time, which makes it
hard to prepare for them.”

Pitt football team in need of some speed 

 

ENRIGHT  
 

ocre 30-26-1 record with some of the
best talent in the nation.

* It doesn't help matters that Notre
Dame has such a ridiculously difficult
schedule, but Holtz can be counted
on to turn the Irish program around
within a year or two. No matter how

Gottfried, after viewing the Irish-
Alabama game films, will have his
run-and-shoot-and-score-some-more
offense smoothly geared to penetrate
the Notre Dame tacklers. After
tailback CraigHeyward’s stampede
against Temple, Holtz will most like-
ly be keying his men directly at
”lronhead.” If that proves to be the
case, the field may open up wide for
Gottfried’s ”passing” fancy. Both
coaches could fire the six—shooters

badly they finish this season, Holtz
has one thing going for him: He can
still recruit some of the best talent in
the country because he is coaching
at Notre Dame. N

High school players everywhere
still dream of playing for Notre
Dame, and they always will.

The situation at Pitt is the same.
Although first-year coach Mike Gott-
fried has already proven that he is a
much better coach than his
predecessor, Foge Fazio, he has in-
herited a team short on talent.

The Panthers are talented, but they
no longer have top-flight potential as
many people still believe.

Many fans failed to remember this
last season when they were shouting
maniacally for Foge’s head. Yes,
Fazio had some talented players and,
his 8-12-2 record the past two
seasons was a bit poor, yet, with the
talent he had, how much better could
he have done?

Gottfried’s plight is similar. He is

early and turn Notre Dame Stadium
into the South Bend Chalk-'Em-Up
Exchange.

So here is a meeting between two
mirror-image teams- The side that
breaks can file 1986 under the ”Wait
Till Next Year” heading, while the
survivor will be one step closer to fil-
ing under ”Who Knows?” Regardless
of the outcome, better days are ahead
for two of college football's pa-
triarchs.

pectation level of the fans is still ex-
tremely high, though not for any
good reasons.

The Panthers no longer have any’

great players who can dominate a
game. Sophomore running back
Craig Heyward could be that type of
player, but it is hard for him to do so
with ‘Gottfried’s emphasis on the
passing game.

John Congemi, Tony Woods and
Randy Dixon are good, proven
players, but none of the three is what
you would call a superstar. Dixon
comes close to filling that role, but
it is hard for an offensive lineman to
dominate a game.

Also, Pitt lacks depth at almost
every position, and it has an apparent
lack of speed. is there a Panther
player who can run a flat-out 4.4

 

40-yard dash? I don't think so, and
even if there are a few with the abili-
ty, 1 can name some college teams of
the '80s who have numerous players
in the 4.4 range. _ '

This column isn't meant to demean
Pitt or its football program. It has on-
ly been written to tell the facts. '

The Panthers wouldn't surprise me
if they won tomorrow in South Bend,
but I wouldn't count on it.

Beware Panther fans, a possible
loss against Notre Dame and with op-
ponents Miami of Florida and Penn
State still to be played, Pitt could very
well be facing its third consecutive
non-winning season.

Gottfried has all the ability to turn
the Panthers into winners, but
anyone who feels that he will, or
should, do that this season. is
delirious.
