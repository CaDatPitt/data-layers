Although their statements vary, most of the local
Forbes Ave. businessmen’ are united in their gen-
eral opinion of the eﬂect that Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld's recent proposed expansion program would
have on"the Oakland area. ‘

They maintain that theprogram would be “good
for education but bad for business.” ,

t The businessmen questioned’ were those located

between the Cathedral of Learning and Oakland’

Ave., the area directly in line for alteration if the
proposal reaches the working stage. .
In this case the future of the business houses at
their present site would be jeopardized.
Most of the businessmen voiced mild comments
on the proposal.
“It won’t help business any but it’s won-
derful for the school,” said the owner of The
Kentriken Gift Shop. ‘.‘Naturally the business-

men that move out will be hurt because they are
well-established, here.” i
The owner of an auto-parts store said much the
same. “The University’s gain will be my loss. I
don’t say it shouldn’t expand, but I think it should

i expand in a different direction.”

From the proprietor of the Park Schenley
Restaurant, which is located directly across from
the University,.came this comment: “I’ve got a.
lot to lose because the restaurant has been here

_ for a long while_ and is established, but it’s for
education and somebody has to suffer." _
“From an educational point of view it’s a move
in the right direction, but. notfrom a business
point of view.” , '
Even though this was the general attitude, sev-

_ eral emphatic statements were made by individuals

who either strongly favored or opposed the move.

I’m all for it,” said one of the owners of the
Civic Center Motor Hotel still under construction
a block from theicathedral.

The owner of a flower shop in the Schenley
Compound spoke optimistically. “It’s good. The
Chancellor isn’t going to do anything unless it’s
right. He has made ﬁne improvements so far..

‘ Aid To Education

Certainly I wouldn’t like to move out of Oakland,
but, I think the plan is ﬁne. Pitt is going to be
an international medical center some day."

A number of businessmen, however, refused to
comment. The Mobilgas garage ‘operator said,
“We’ve had so many people asking questions that
were tired of it. I wouldn’t give an opinion.”

“The less I say about it the better off I'll be."
a. grocer remarked. ' .
Most talkative were those individuals directly

opposed to the proposal. They felt that the Uni-
versity was overstepping its bounds.

“I've spent eight years of sweat and toil build-
ing this place up,” said Frank Gustine, the bar and
restaurant proprietor. “The plan is going to knock
me and all the little Gustine’s off our feet.

“I have to be self-centered about this thing,
after all, it’s my place of business. I don't know
what the University has in mind unless it’s to

New School
Assembly

Starts Year

(See picture Page 8)«
The new Graduate School
of _ Public and International
Affairs marked its official

_ opening with a First Assem-

bly last Wednesday afternoon
in the Supper Room of the
Schenley Student Union.

The First Assembly of students
met_ for introductions to the
School’s faculty and a presenta-
tion of plans and arrangements for
the initial year. ,

Reverend Howard Scharfe, a
University trustee, gave the in-
vocation. This was followed by a
brief address from Chancellor
Litchﬁeld.

The Chancellor expressed deep
satisfaction at the opening of the
School and emphasized the need
for broadly trained administra-
tors _to_ ﬁll increasingly import-
ant positions in public affairs.

“Not only is there a need for
competent personnel to administer
existing "institutions with an un-
derstanding of contemporary so-
ciety,” he said, _“but we foresee in
the light of rapid social change
a necessity for a greater skill on
the part of future administrators
who will face increasingly com-
plex problems.”

In his keynote speech, J. Henry
O’Neil1, trustee of the University,
stated that the new school adds an
important demension to the Uni-
versity’s total program.‘

Initial Conversion Planned For

Freshmen ‘And Sophomores "Only

By JOANNE DOLINAR
The trimester program will go into effect in September,
1959, for freshmen and sophomores in Liberal Arts, Phar-
macy and Engineering and Mines, it was revealed recently.
Preliminary planning for the conversion will be done
during this school year. As yet, many details have not been

worked. out.

The plan calls for the imple-
mentation of the program in all
undergraduate classes and in all
undergraduate schools in Septem-
ber of 1960. ' I

In September, ’ 1961, it is
planned to introduce trimesters
into the professional schools.

A letter is being prepared to be
sent to the faculty with further
information concerning this inno-
vation.

The trimester proposal was first
made in the Chancellor’s inaugu-
ral address last May. He offered
the program as one which might
enable the University to take the
lead in meeting the American
educational crisis.

This plan will reduce the span
of time required of the student
without reducing the quality of
instruction. According to infor-
mationreleased last year, stu-
dents will be admitted at the
beginning of any trimester.

Student participation in any
year will be on a voluntary basis.
A student might attend only two
of the three trimesters and be
considered a full time student. He
would complete the work now
done in two_semesters. .

For example,’ if he chose to omit
the spring semester, he would be
free from approximately the end
of April to the ﬁrst week of Sep-
tember.— Thus, he would be avail-
able early for the summer em-
ployment market.

An Activities Fair will be held
at the Student Union Ballroom
and Supper Room on Monday,
September 29.

The main purpose of the Fair,
which is sponsored. by AWS and
Men’s Council, is to acquaint stu-
dents with the various activities

and organizations at the Univers-_

ity.

Displays will be set up from
noon to 4 p.m. to supply adequate
information as to the amount, ex-
tent, and type of student partici-
pation in these actfvities.

This is the first time that a
‘panoramic view of all activities
in the University will be pre-
sented to the entire student
body, both men and women.

At the Fair the students will be
encouraged to participate in the

schools of this type. VVe are
proud to be in the lead. The best
talent that can be recruited and
trained is required in local
state, and national affairs as well
as international.”

Vice Chancellor Elvis J. Stahr,
Jr., told the Assembly that the
most distinctive feature of the
new School is its aim to find pro-
fessional leaders. To ﬁnd these
leaders is the most acute person-
nel need in the world today.”

Dean Stone informed the stu-
dents on what fundamental char-
acteristics the school will be bas-
ed. He first mentioned the ‘interna-
tional composition of the member-
ship which now consists of 65 stu-
dents from 17 countries. This
would in itself create at second
intercultural characteristic of the
school.

The new School will also have
an interdisciplenary aspect with
personnel from the Political Sci-
ence, Economic, and Administra-
tive Science departments com-
bining with specialists from
other institutions, as far off as
California, combining to create
the staff of the new school.

For the year 1958-59 degrees are
being offered in three concentra-
tions: General Public Administra-

tion, Administration of Interna-
tional Affairs, and in Municipal-
Metropolitan Administration.
"Courses and special faculty—stu-
dent seminars are being offered in
two other concentrations now be-
ing developed: Community Affairs
Administration, under the joint
auspices of Carnegie Institute of
Technology and the University,
and the other, a program in Plan-
ning and Urban Development.

The School will offer two pro- ,

grams for foreign students; a
one month course for Public Ad-
ministration Specialists and an
Institute of Organization Man-
agement which will last about
four and one half months.

Students seeking a degree from
the school will put in from one
to two years of study according
to their personal background and

. knowledge.

.Establishment of the School,
twelfth of the University’s pro-
fessional schools, was ﬁrst an-
nounced by Chancellor, Litchﬁeld
in December 1956.

C. Stone, former director of the

N etc Teaching Method Planned

For Elementary Ed Students

A unique program designed to acquaint beginning ele-
mentary teachers withthe total experience of teaching will
be initiated this fall by the School of Education of the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh.

The new teaching method differs from the usual student
teacher program in its aim of introducing the young in-

structors to teaching as an all in-6

clusive act.

It includes not only participa-
tion and teaching, but also in-
volvement in the setting up of‘-the
school’s total program. The in-

_ novation is planned in two phases.

During the University's spring
semester, theistudent will attend
two morning sessions per month
at the school to which he or she
is assigned. . '

This orientation period will ac-
quaint the “prospective teachers
with the plans and problems of
their assigned school.

In the next phase, conducted in
the fall between the opening of
the student’s respective schools,
and the opening of the University,
the student will be a full time
member of his school’s staff.

Later in this phase, the stu-
dent will participate ﬁve morn-
ings and two afternoons per

week. These longer time periods
will result in the student's hav-
ing a broader understanding of
the school and of teaching.
The program will be presented
in four public school centers this
fall, with an eventual goal of

many district elementary schools.

_ 'Pre-registration was attempted
‘T for the ﬁrst time last week. Its

complete success this time is sub-
ject to question, ‘yet its future
possibilities are unlimited.

0 ‘ The set-up provides for the
channels of pre-registration to
begin in the admissions office, to’
continue‘ with evaluation of Place-
, ment Tests and College _Board

Scores by the ‘adviser’with the

“student, the arrangement of a
schedule, the completion of sched-
,uling by the adviser and the
Registrar’s Office so that no pre-
registered student_must pull his
own cards.

' Some pre—registered ﬁrst—sem-
ester sophomore students com-
plained that, in meeting with their
advisers in the spring, the advisers
spent little time in directing_ or
making suggestions and merely
- transcribed a hastily prepared, ill-
. conceived notion of what a stu-

dent thought he might want.

Reports on the summer meet-
ings with freshman students in-
dicate that they were most worth-
n while. .

With the scheduling proper,
problems" arose that prevented
. s'ome'of the freshman and sopho-
more cards from being pulled.

V V Some of these students were
. also burdened with evening classes
since the distribution of sections
. was hampered by a lack of room
‘ space. The pressing need for new
building facilities is further em-
phasized by some of our present
registration difficulties.

The whole registration process
again took much more time than

 Il‘egistratibn Rumbles

it would have if the students had,

been able to pick up a completed
kit containing registration cards
‘and all class cards.

The Board of Liberal Arts Ad-
visers is to be commended for

their devoted efforts in getting the_
system. organized so that,‘ when -V

channels are ironed out, the stu-

dent will have an adviser with
whom he’may discuss any aca-
demic difficulty.

He will be able to get “adult”
aid from aperson who is aware
of the facilities that the Univers-
ity has available such as the
Counseling Center and Testing
Service to help
themselves. ‘

This will- spread out the regis-
tration chaos over a longer, far
more leisurely period so that
hasty conclusions need not be
reached. '

There will then be little time
wasted on registration, and‘ it
will be done with the proper di-
rection at hand.

It should be emphasized that
the Board of Liberal Arts Advis-

ers was not formed solely for pre- ~

registration purposes. They are to
serve the year long to aid students
with their academic problems
and, coupled with this, their
course selection. /

T h e actual pre-registration
mechanical process should be
handled by the Registrar’s Office
or appointees of this office to sec-
tion courses by demand and thus
a v oid overcrowding and odd
timing.

  
  
   
  
  
 

The opening of the School of
Public and International Affairs
marks a milestone in Pitt’s climb
to international repute.

The students are from many
lands and will contribute to each
other a variety of viewpoints and-
backgrounds.

The concept of living together
in one dormitory and thus having

tMiiIestone 0n Wu y Up 0

a mutual sharing of ideas on the
informal as well as_ the formal
basis is indeed a ﬁne one.

Perhaps it can be incorporated
in some of the other graduate and
professional schools in the near
future. A

The course programming should
prepare these students for a dom-
inant role in the administration of
government affairs.

, By Murray C|1ass«

The only Senators representing the District of
Columbia in the nation’s capitol are the nine who
throw a ball around in a large‘ stadium and not
the two who throw the bull around in a large as-

sembly hall. I

And if the nation’s politicians have it their way,

Washington will always be rep-
resented by the baseball nine.
It’s an unfortunate circum-
stance that Calvin .Grifﬁth,- ‘son
of the late Clark Grifﬁth——one of

has come up against. The ma-

of the Senators, Griffith has
found himself and the team los-
ing money the past few years
because of lack of support by
the fans. 0
Senators Battle for Cellar

The reason for this lack of support is simple:
the Senators are perennial battlers for the cellar.
Right now they are safely tucked away in the coal
.hole for the 1958 season. Last“year only 457,079
‘ fans saw the Senators ﬁnish ineighth place. The
owners are hopping to see that ﬁgure barely sur-

passed this season.

A move, then, is in order. Such is the ‘thinking
of Mir. Griﬁith. So is moving the team to another
city going to make the team any better, you ask?
‘It probably wouldn’t, although two teams that
have transferred playing sites in the past few
years have attained quick and greater success in

their new locations.

(The Braves jumped from seventh to second
after moving from Boston to Milwaukee, and the
Giants so far have gonevfrom sixth to third in
switching from one coast to another.)

Whereas Mr. Griffith can only hope that his
team’s fortune takes’ a turn for the better, he knows
that his ,cash register will begin to ﬁll up if he *

moves.

Minneapolis has promised the Senators a 41,000-
seat park, a guarantee of 3,000,000 admissions for
the first three years and other money-making con-
cessions. Even without the guaranteed attendance,
the Senators would make money. Minneapplis‘, like
a few other baseball-starved cities‘, would flock to»
the ball park to see major league teams. '

At least the fans would come-until they got tired
of seeing “minor league baseball for major league

" You see, “The Common Glory”
is a documented, unabridged
flag-waver designed to make one
‘proud of our forefathers and our
heritage. It succeeds. The point
is, however, that it was being
presented in a section of the
country which seems to continu-
ally insist that certain concepts

of our forefathers and certain ‘

elements of our heritage are,
worthless or even ‘false. Thus.
this insistence wasnot only made
more evident by both the nature
of the la}? and, more s eciﬁcally,

-ering

Two of these assertions stood
out most dramatically. They

were both made by Thomas Jeff—,

erson, the central character, and
they both dealt directly with’ the
problem at hand — equality.
The. ﬁrst arose during a meet-
ing of Jefferson, Patrick Henry,
and several lesser‘ known patriots
on a Virginia plantation.’ The
war was months away and still
uncertain but already these men
were resigned to accept it if it
came because, as they said, it
would be a “just war.” _
“We will be ﬁghting for great
things,” one of them declared.
“Yes,” another added, “for free
speech, for a free press . . .”

Equal Educa-lion? .

"And,”- Jefferson interrupted
before the man could finish, “for
en equal education for all the
people,” and he reiterated,” for
all the people.”

It sounded fine. But the trouble
was that the actions of promi-
nent present day Virginians were

at that very time following paths

which bore little relationship to
the meaning or spirit of Jeffer-
son’s words. In Arlington, Nor-
folk, and Charlottsville, school
-boards and public officials were

‘ threatening to employ their po-

licy of “massive resistance” to
the Supreme Court decision ord-
integration of p u b 1 i c
schools.

If integration occurred, then

these authorities claimed that, .

according to State law, the
schools‘ would automatically be

‘- closed. And at anapple grower’s

convention V Senator ‘Harry E.

ed ‘$1.0 '

But the politicians have said nothing about
these teams. They have made no threats in their
direction. It seems that they are looking out for
their own selﬁsh interests in the case of the Sena-‘

sWashing'lo,n Deserves Team?

But is it right? VVashington deserves a major
league team no more than any other prosperous city
in the "country. We wonder if any one ever polled
the Congressmen as to how many games each at-
tends during the season. Their work should keep
them occupied enough that they can’t get to many’

And it doesn’t seem logical that the Senators.
and Representatives duck -out to Griffith Stadium
every time they get a chance. If they’re so keen on ’
the great America_n pasttime, let them make the
short trip "to Baltimore, and by the way, see a bet-
ter team. (The Orioles were originally the St. Louis‘

[For the time being, though, the politicians have_
been successful. The expected request for a trans-“
fer never materialized. Even had it, four American
League teams were reportedly ready to vote against

the ‘defense of a “righteous

‘ cause.” So while a -historical Vir-

ginian said, “all the people,” a
contemporary Virginian looked,
the other way and‘ said,”- no,
only some.” (By the way,_ what.
does “righteous” mean?)

The second assertion came a
little later, and in this case itﬁ
was not necessary to look quite,»
as far to ﬁnd the contradictory
feeling of the local populace.’ In; 
fact it was not necessary to look if 
beyond the auditorium itself. For._‘.

How GREENFWAS MY CAMPUS

Don’t tell me: I know how busy you’ve been! ‘ I know all the L

things _vou’ve had to do in the opening days of the school year-
registering, paying fees, ﬁnding lodgings, entering a drag race,
getting married, building a cage for your raccoon. But now,
_with all these essentials out of the way, let us pause and join
hands andtake, for the ﬁrst time, a long, leisurely look at our
campus.
Ready? Lct’s go!

\Ve begin our tour over here on this lovely stretch of green-
sward called The,Mall. The Mall, as we all know, was named in
honor of our distinguished alumnus Fred Mall, inventor of the
opposing thumb. Before Mr. Mall’s invention, the thumb could
not be pressed or clicked against the other fingers. As a result,
millions of castanet makers were out of work. Today however,
thanks to Mr. Mall, one out of every three Americans is gain-
fully employed making castanets. (The other two make croquet
wickets.) Mr. Mall is now 106 years old and living in seclusion
on a sea cliff in VVellington, Kansas, but the old gentleman is
far from idle. He still works twelve hours a day in his labora-
tory, and in the last year has invented the tuna, the cuticle,
and lint. - —

 

But I digress. Let us resume our tour. Atthe end of The
Mall we see a handsome ediﬁce called The library. Here books
are kept. By “kept” I mean “kept.” There is no way in the
world for you to get a. book out of the library. . . No, I’m
wrong. If you have a stack permit you can take out a book,
but stack permits are issued only to widows of Presidents of the
United-States. (That lady you see coming out of the library
with a copy of Girl of the Limbcrlosl is Mrs. Millard Fillmore.)

Next to The Library we see the Adrninistration Building.
Here one ﬁnds the president of the university, the deans, and
the registrar. According to ancient academic usage, the p1'esidcnt
is always called “Prexy.” Similarly, the deans are called “Dixie”
and the registrar is called “Roxy.” Professors are called “Proxy”
and housemothers are called “Hoxy-Moxy.” Students are
called “Algae.”

Diagon-ally across The Mall we see the Students Union. It is
a gay. mad place, franklyldcdicated to the fun and relaxation
of we undergraduates. Here we undergraduates may enjoy
ourselves in one of two ways—with ﬁlter or without. We under-
graduates who prefer ﬁlters, prefer Marlboro, of course. Oh,
what a piece of work is Marlboro! The ﬁlter ﬁlters, the taste is
smooth but not skimpy, mild but not meagre.

VVe undergraduates who prefer non-filters, prefer Philip
Morris, of corris. It is a natural smoke, a clean smoke, a flavor-
ful, zestlul, pure and peaceful smoke . . . Now hear this: Philip
Morris and Marlboro each come in a choice of two packs-—
crushproof Flip-Top Box or the familiar Soft Puck.

So now, as the setting sun casts a ﬁery aura over the spires
and bat-tlements of our beloved campus, let us hie ourselves to
our tobacconist’s and lay in a night’s supply of Marlboro _or
Philip Morris, and then let us, lowing, wind slowly o’er the lea
to our dormitories and sit upon our armysurplus cots, spent!
but content, and smoke and dreamand hark the curfew toll the
knell of parting day. Aloha, fair campus, aloha!

Desperate Pass Leads

To Bruins’ Only Tally; '

Toncic Scores Twice

By LARRY HAGGERTY
For the past three years
many football observers have
claimed that Panther Coach

‘John Michelosen has lacked

a

' because Bill Kaliden’s

imagination in his offensive
attack.

Well, Saturday afternoon in the
Los Angeles Coliseum Michelosen
openedwide the Blue and Gold
attack like a telephone book—and
at’ the right number. Before a
crowd of 30,578 the Panthers reg-
istered an impressive 27-6 upset
over George Dickerson’s UCLA
single wingers. ‘

Michelosen not only opened up

his attack but he flung back the
lid of his treasure chest and parad-
ed an unsuspected wealth of “B”
units, “C” units and even sopho-
mores. These hidden assets turned

‘out to be pure gold.

Change of Tactics
In fact it was surprising to wit-
ness riotuos strength of Johnny’s
long suppressed imagination. In-
stead of Waiting to score in the
second half, the Panthers took the
opening kickoff and went 71 yards
in ten plays for a touchdown.
Ivan Toncic, starting chiefly
injured
instep would not allow him to
operate at his best, scored two
touchdowns, Dick Haley and
Mike Ditka accounted for one
touchdown each and Norton
Seaman kicked a 14-yard ﬁeld
goaL

UCLA’s only touchdown was the
direct result of a 58-yard despera-
tion pass with 25 seconds to play
in the ﬁrst half and Skyscraper U.
leading, 12-0. This was the Bruin’s
first game under Dickerson who
succeeded the late Red Sanders as
coach.

Gain Consistent Yardage

From the opening kickoff the
Panthers drove from their own
29-yard line in ten plays, with
Toncic sending hight halfback Joe
Scisly throught the left side of the

.Bruin line for consistent yardage.

At the UCLA 30-yard line
Toncic rolled out to the right on
a bootleg play and passed to
Art Gob for 28 yards and a first
down. Toncic then scored on a
sneak from the one.

The Panthers went for only one
point after the touchdown, but
Seaman’s placement was wide to

‘the left. They tried a pass and two

placements after their subsequent
touchdowns but got nothing.
Passing Causes Trouble

UCLA began to make some pro-
gress with quick passes out of the
single wing and run-or-pass op-
tions, but passing got the Bruins
into deep trouble early in the sec-
ond quarter.

Toncic came rushing up from
the secondary to intercept Don
Long’s pass from midfield and
ran it back 56 yards for a touch-
down. At the 25-yard line Long
had a. chance to catch Toncic but
the Panther star out-sprinted
him.

With less than a minute remain-
ing in the ﬁrst half, Billy Kilmer,
UCLA’s third string sophomore
tailback, passed 58 yards to Marv
Luster to the Panther two. Kilmer

-_’ then scored, but Ditka blocked the

only ten seconds to play sopho-.

Michelosen gave his centers-
Don Crafton, Seraﬁno Fazio and

ing All-American End Dick
Wallen hog-tied. Wallen caught
only one pass. UCLA’s running
game was never much of a pro-
blem for the question-mark
Panther line which may not be
a question-mark any longer.

The Panthers had to resort to
ice packs, wet towels and oxygen
tanks because of the heat. Neither
the heat nor UCLA could deter
them.

Low Morale Problem
Slows Grid Yearlings

For some strange reason the freshman football team un-
der Coach Lou Cecconi is having trouble in the morale de-

partment.

‘ According to Coach Cecconi, “The unusual low in morale
among the freshman players is partially due to the large
amount of injuries on the team. The injuries thus far have

only been minor but have de—¢
creased our number of players.”
Thirty-four candidates reported
for practice which began on Sept.
3. The freshman squad is being
drilled in the ,varsity’s offense,
which is the wing right with a
ﬂanking end. ' -

Cecconi is hopeful that incom-
ing freshman will be interested
enough ‘A to come“ out for the
team. “Any freshman boys com-
ing out for the team,” said Cec-
coni, “are sure of-playing some
football. All starting positions
on the team are still wide open.”

‘Boss’ Speaks
Before Putting

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

 

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Captain Torn Hamilton stilllooks like a football player.
The director of University athletics stands over six feet tall
and his heavy shoulders retain the imperceptible hunch of
the alert lineman. His hands are large and tough—‘a visible
fact which is reinforced by the vigorous handshake.

His movements, when walking", reveal the springing
stride of an athlete. His eyes are intense and inspecting as
they combine with a booming, sometimes gruff, voice to make
a conversation compelling alive and direct.

I had a chance to talk to the “Boss”, as his coaches re-

-spectfully identify him among each other, during the last

week in August. The athletic department annually arranges

for an informal party for the newspapermen, radio and TV
-boys who stay alive by writing-and talking about Pittsburgh

-‘sports. The affair has been staged at the Wildwood Club the
past two years, and at the kind invitation of “Beano”=Cook
I joined the party. _ I

, Late in the afternoon I met Hamilton on the clubhouse
‘sun porch and he graciously asked me to spend a few mo-
ments and get acquainted. I remarked enthusiastically about
the layout of the newest Pitt property, which includes a golf
course, tennis courts, swimming pool, club house, and athletic
ﬁelds. ‘

“We were pleased with the use of the club by both stu-
dents and faculty this summer,” said the Captain, “but there
was room for many more. I hope when school starts that the
kids keep coming out. The golfscourse will be open for a long
while yet, and there is plenty of room for football, softball,
hiking», and a raft of other games.” «

“Some of the groups at school have already planne
winter parties for Wildwood which I think will be terriﬁc,”
he continued. Snow on the long golf fairways will make the
club ideal for toboganning and general fun. The facility is
there to be used by everyone in the University family and
Hamilton’s suggestion to make use of it is an excellent one.

’ My own brief inspection of the place that day’conVinc_ed
me that the “suburban campus” is a ﬁne retreat for all Pitt
students, 12 months a year. The country atmosphere is com-
plete and refreshing: -the" kind of change of pace which all
city boys ﬁnd exciting.

Hamilton moved’ the subject _from the club itself to the
football team which he allowed would be better, but how
muchso he could only guess. His conﬁdence in Coach Michel-
osen and his assistants was unmistakable as he emphasized
the point that the players’ guidance was superior.

Asked about the Pitt physical education program, a fav-
orite topic of his, Hamilton reasserted his belief that the re-
quirement should be two years instead of the present one for
all men, excepting R.O.T.C. boys. 4 '

He was about to expound on this view more_emphatical__ly
when someone cried- that it was time for the Captain to op-
pose a city sports editor in a putting contest. With that he
excused himself and eagerly strode off, choking a putter in
his right hand. He promised more latter.

The Panthers will lose only
three players from graduation,
but the failure of six other
players to report will weaken
the squad. Ronald Polmilsak,
last year’s star fullback, ‘is also
a question mark because of a
back ﬁinjury received during the
summer. ‘

Of the forthcoming season
Bemis stated: “We have a rough
schedule ahead, but I believe that
our boys will make a good show-
ing of themselves in every game."

Only Dietzgen Slide Rules
' have these great features

Professional engineers soy Dierzgen's new slide rules
embody the greatest advances in design in more than
a quarter century. Dietzgen's exclusive Micromotic
Adiuslmenl permits perfect alignment of the scales at
- all times. Simple resetting of one screw does it. The
end plates need not be loosened; fit and action of the
slide is never disturbed.
Dietzgen's automatic slide tension insures perfect
_ slide action wherever and whenever these rules are
used. Slides cannot bind or sticl<—-nor become loose
so errors may result from accidental slide movement.

‘ These are truly great slide rules. Important new scales

added. New super-safe corryingvcose. See them at
your Dietzgen dealer today.

The operator of Miller's News
Store spoke angrily: “I don’t like
it. This is my store and I've been
here for 50 years. Why pick on a
business area to move into when
there are other areas."

When asked if he thought the
plan would go through, Miller
replied, “Oh ‘yes, it will go
through. Politics and Mellon will
get it through. You can’t buck
them.”

The manager of the Betsy Ross
Restaurant answered with ques-
tions: “What do you mean? Do you
mean how do I like the idea of be-
ing thrown out? How wbuld you
like _it?”

Several of the businessmen men-
tioned that they had heard rumors
about attempts to form an organi-
ed body of opposition to the Uni-
versity’s proposal.

(EclitoT’s N o t e: Chancellor
Litchﬁeld expressed the view at
a recent press conference that
he wishes no harm to any com-
mercial establishment and that
only a willingness on their part
to sell will result in the propos-
ed expansion.)

The three faculty appointments
possible would be nine month
teaching appointments, 12 month
teaching appointments and 12
month teaching and research ap-
pointments.

Litchﬁeld last year explained
the advantages of the trimester
program. “Students would be able
to obtain a more complete edu-
cation within the time usually
spent in college than is possible
under the two semester plan."

In pointing out the economic
advantages of entering‘ the busi-
ness world earlier than ever be-
fore, he said that a student
could receive the equivalent ot_
a four year liberal arts pro-’
gram and full course in law oi‘
medicine in ﬁve years.‘ 4,

Trimesters have met with obj: -
tion from some of the student
body. Some feel that 11 months
of schooling a year would bring
too much pressure on the students
and teachers.

The loss of the spirit of unity of
the classes and the inability of
organizations to work eﬁectively
have been brought up as deﬁnite
disadvantages.

Pitt will become the ﬁrst school
in_the country to have a trimester
program in operation when the
Elan goes into effect next Septem-

er.
