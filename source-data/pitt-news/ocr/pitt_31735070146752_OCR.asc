Sestak pitch

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Democratic senate candidate Joe Sestak out-
lined yesterday his version of the American
Dream — a version that doesn’t include Re-
publican Pat Toomey serving as Pennsylvania’s
next U.S. senator. .

In a half-hour speech in the Teplitz Court-
room in Pitt’s Barco Law Building, Sestak urged
the audience and America at large to reignite
the American Dream, and he criticized Toom-
ey’s policy stances along the way. Representa-
tives from Toomey’s campaign criticized some
of Sestak’s remarks in a separate interview.

es the American Dream

Sestak addressed a largely enthusiastic
crowd — blue Sestak-for-Senate signs, stick-
ers and buttons dotted the mixed group of
about 200 students, faculty and community
members. Several times during the speech
they interrupted him for applause. S

If elected, Sestak said he would work to
shore up the American middle class so that
they can “build wealth up” and allow the next
generation the same chances he and his father
— a captain in the Navy —— had.

Sestak explained that his solidarity with
“the working families of Pennsylvania” comes
from his 31-year Navy career, during which he
achieved the rank of admiral.

“Like in the U.S. Navy—-where we invested
in our sailors who then made our military

strong — as a.Congressman,,I’ve always stood

with the working families who drive this coun-

try forward,” he said.

“The workingfamily,” aphrase Sestak used
with some variation six times in the speech,
would stand as a higherpriority than strict
party adherence, he said.

“That’s why I’ve never been content to play
by the old rules — and why I deﬁed the lead-
ers of my party to enter this race in the ﬁrst
place,” he said.

Sestak defeated Democratic Sen. Arlen
Specter in the May primary after a hotly con-
tested election. Specter had the endorsement
of President Barack Obama and much of the

South Side
revelry.
reconsidered

Amy Friedenberger
Staﬂ” Writer

People packed the sidewalks in the South Side
at midnight one evening last month._]udging by
the shouts of people as they walked — orwob-
bled — by, the South Side bars Tiki-Lounge and
Town Tavern were popular at the moment.
Outside the Tiki Lounge, I found myselfin
the center of a bachelorette party. The bride-

_ to—be, in her 20s, wore a pink sash and silver

crown. Her name was Andrea Wlliams.

“This is my last night to get crazy,” Wil-
liams said. _ %

Her group of bridesmaids chose the South
Side to celebrate the bachelorette party because
it’s “the best place to get drunk,” she said.

To‘ the chagrin of Councilman Bruce Kraus,
Williams’ sentiment seems to be apopular one
these days, causing tension to brew between
Pittsburgh City Council and some South Side
residents and bar owners.

Kraus said problems with drinking and wild
behavior have plagued the South Side for the
past 17 or 18 years and “no one seems to want
to address it.” ,

While waiting at a bus shelter, I’m joined
by company. A‘ man sat down next to me and
put his arm around my shoulder. The smell of
alcohol in his breath was overpowering.

“Hey baby, what’s your name?”

He seemed harmless, so I gave in.

“We arein love and are goingto get married.
You just don’t know it yet.” ‘

He then proceeded to grab my shoulder"

and plant a kiss on my cheek. T

About 30 minutes later, the members of
the bachelorette party stumbled out of Tiki
Lounge, holding on to each other as they made

Sestak challenges Toomey on ﬁscal, social views

Sestak 4 1

local and state Democratic party.

Toomey campaign spokesman Tim Kelly
said that Sestak isn’t as independent of the
Democratic party as he often claims.

“The only examples Sestak is able to cite as
proof ofhis so-called independence is when he
was ﬁirthering his own political ambitions,”
Kelly said.

During the speech, Sestak said that Toom-
ey’s extreme, “tricl<le—down” policies are part
of what put the United States in its current
economic slump. He said that Toomey wanted
to favor the interests oflarge corporations over
those of small business owners.

“My opponent is woefully out of touch,
and far too extreme, for our Commonwealth,”
he said. ‘

He described Toomey as having a “rigid
mindset,” “rigid ideology” and “rigid ideas”

in relation to economic policies — charges he
repeated ﬁve times during the speech.

Later, Kelly responded to Sestak’s claims
that Toomey put corporate interests above
the average voter with a salvo of his own:
“Congressman Sestak might be the only per-
son in America who-thinks the failed Obama
stimulus was too small and the health care
takeover didn’t go far enough. Now that’s ex-
treme, and it’s why Pennsylvania voters are
rejecting him.” V

Both Toomey and Sestak have accused each
other of being “too extreme” for the Pennsyl-
vania electorate several times since the general
election campaign began in May.

Sestak also said that foreign corporations
and foreign donors have started contributing
with advertisements to Republican campaigns
in the wake of the Supreme Court decision

stemming from Citizens United v. the Federal
Elections Commission.

I In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that
funding of independent political broadcasts
in ‘elections cannot be limited under the First
Amendment. Sestak and other Democrats have
said the decision allows big corporations to cir-
cumvent limits on campaign contributions.

Obama leveled a similar charge during a
rally in Philadelphia on Sunday.

Kelly did not immediately respond to Ses- if

tak’s comments on foreign campaign spend-
mg.

The Pitt Law Democrats organized the
event, which president Dwyer Arce said “came
out of the blue.”

-He said the Sestak campaign had called
him barely aweek ago to see if the group could
organize Monday’s event.  A

   

UPMC,
leader” dies
at 86

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Thomas P. Detre, the man largely credited with

piloting UPMC to international prominence ,

through innovative funding and research strat-
egies, died Saturday in his home after a long
illness. He was 86. p

Detre served as Pitt’s senior vice chancellor
for the health sciences between 1975 and 1998.
Duringthat time, manyinPitt’s administration
consideredhimto beadrivingforce behind Pitt’s
success as a major research institution.

In a statement issued Saturday by UPMC,
Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said Detre
was “the most accomplished academic leader
I have known  and it was a great privilege to
workwith and learn from him.” .

“Dr. Det1'e’s leadership in bringing world-
class medicine and pioneering research to west-

‘ em Pennsylvania transformed the character and

culture ofthis region,” Nordenberg said. “He was
a manbeloved forhis kindness, compassion, wit
and old-world charm.”

Detre began his career at Pitt after leaving
a tenured position at Yale to become a director
at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and
the University granted him emeritus status as a
senior vice chancellor in 2004.

Before comingto Pitt, Detre attended medi-
cal school in Rome after immigrating there from
Hungary. When he graduated he set up a small
practice in the city before moving to the United
States. He redid his residency at a New York
hospital and joined Yale’s faculty.-

One of tlie reasons Detre moved to the United
States was that “he couldn’t work hard enough
in Italy,” his sonjohn Detre said.

“He had two or three positions in Rome, but

Stem-cell research effective

Pitt researchers improve and expand use of adult stem cells

Gwenn Barney
Staﬂ"Writerj

It comes straight from science fiction:
scientists rebuilding damaged body parts,
slowing the aging process in animals and
repairing damaged hearts with an- injec-
tion. “ .

0 They are actually the reality of research

_ in Pitt’s Stem Cell Research Center, part

of the McGowan Institute for Regenera-
tive Medicine. The research center does
cutting-edge work with adult stem cells,
which are significantly different from the
controversial embryonic stem cells.
“We’re trying to ﬁnd ways to improve
the quality of life for patients,” said John
Huard, the center’s director. “It’s a transla-
tion of medicine. We’re takingsomething
from the lab to bring it to the bedside.”
Huard and his team of researchers are
developing stem cell repairs for parts of

‘ the body ranging from the bladder to the

heart. Pitt researchers stepped away from
one school of thought when they decided
to focus on adult stem cells.

For many years, adult stem cells were
considered insufﬁcient for regenerative
medicine research because, unlike em-
bryonic stem cells, they can’t multiply
indefinitely. But through their research,
scientists at the center continue to prove

that not only are adult stem cells sufficient
for research, but they are safer for use
by patients than their embryonic coun-
terparts. '

Embryonic stem cells have greater po-
tential than adult stem cells to be rejected
by a patient’s body or to multiply uncon-
trollably into cancerous tumors.

“With adult stem cells, we don’t have
to deal with rejection or them becoming
cancer as often,” Huard said.

Mitra Lavasani, a post-doctoral as-
sociate, works on an experiment aiming
to slow the aging process in mice with
Progeria, a disease that produces rapid
aging. Her work involves repairing muscle
damage, something she said adult, muscle-
derived stem cells are better equipped for
than embryonic ones.’

Shesaid embryonic stem cells have not
been shown to regenerate muscle "very
well.

The center’s research with adult stem
cells has not been affected by recent le-
gal rigmaro_le involving embryonic stem
cells.

In August, Federal Districtjudge Royce

Lamberth banned government funding of I

embryonic stem cell research, blocking

That’s how a lot of the people entered and
left bars.»Like an assembly line, sober-looking
people entered the bar, then, as if they ﬂicked a
switch, they came stumbling out of the building
some time later.

Crime

Crime in the South Side has garnered media
attention recently.

Two of the many incidents reported involved
high-proﬁle Pitt students. Injuly, Pitt’s defen-
sive endjabaal Sheard threw a man through a
glass door, according to a criminal complaint.
Sheard pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct

_ on Aug. 4. 1

Another Pitt football player,Jason Douglas,
was arrested in the South Side and charged
Sept. 12 with driving under the inﬂuence,
causing an accident involving personal injury,
underage drinking and aggravated assault by
vehicle while DUI. His next hearingwill be on
Oct. 28. The court docket available online did
not contain a plea for Douglas, who was sus-
pended indeﬁnitely from the team following
the charges. -

City crime statistics show that police have

investigated 50 aggravated assaults in the South .

Side Flats since July this year. There were 49
reports of aggravated assault for the entire
2009 year. -

According to the Bureau of Police 2009
Aimual Report, there were 107 violent crime
offenses reported to law enforcement in the
South Side Flats. In addition, 719 reports were
made concerning property crime.

Councilman Kraus, who represents much
of the South Side, has grown more concerned
with the property andviolent crime inthe past
year. V

Last August, Kraus collaborated with his
intern Bryan Woll, a student at Georgetown Uni-

versity, to produce a 95-page report document-

ing the main concerns of the South Side. ,
The report, titled “Inviting, Safe and Co-
hesive: A Proposal for the Management of

‘ the South Side Using Responsible Hospitality

Practices,” discusses numerous measures that

at least60 cities have adopted to improve the '

relations between_the daytime and nighttime
life.
Several of the proposals require legislation,

Senior vice chancellor leaves legacy of progress

he couldn’t really fulﬁll his ambitions there,”
John Detre said. “He wasn’t a guy who spent
Sundays throwing a baseball in the back yard,
that’s for sure.”

During his years at Pitt, Detre attracted a
number of accomplished physicians and re-
searchers to Western Psych.

Together, Thomas Detre and fellow admin-
istrators reorganized the research funding
structure of UPMC. They did this by driving

ﬁmding from clinical practice into research,‘

using the research ﬁndings to improve the clini-

cal practice and attracting more patients and
researchers.

Dr. Arthur Levine, who took over as senior
vice chancellor in 1998, recalled Det1'e’s skill
at guiding Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic. T

“[Detre] brought WPIC into the modern
era of biological psychiatry  encouraging in-
terdisciplinary efforts and high standards of
scholarship that became and continue to be
the foundation of our exceptional growth and
achievement,” Levine said in a release.

John Detre described his father as an ex-
tremely well—dressed man who loved espresso.
“Anyone who knew him well knew he loved cof-
fee. He used to drink like 20 cups of espresso a
day, and smokingwas certainly a big hobby of
his,”]ohn Detre said. “Hewas also know for his
dress. I think a lot of medical professionals at
Pitt and UPMC dress the way they do because
of him -— always a j acket and tie.”

V Ellen Orrnond, Thomas Detre’s second wife,
also described his personal life.
“I got to know Thomas after his ﬁrst wife

:~~.‘u..u.-new-an-..___._._..-_,..._ _..

died in20o6, and we married in 2008,” she said.
“In that time hewas atruly remarkable person.
He retired from his work incredibly gracefully
and really made transitions we .”

Ormond said Detre was always humble
about his professional successes.

“He never thought about the past very much,
and he was not very interested in gathering
accolades for his past accomplishments,” she
said. “His success pleased him immensely obvi-
ously, but he always most enjoyed whatever he
was doing next.” I

stem cell research.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia put
a stay on the ban, temporarily allowing
government funding to continue until the
court can more formally analyze the case
and make a permanent ruling.

Whereas embryonic stem cell research-
ers must worry about the possibility of lost
government funding, scientists in SCRC
can breathe easy: Research with adult-
derived stem cells is legal and has attracted
less controversy.

Burhan Gharaibeh, a research assistant
professor, works on a project funded by the
Department of Defense. He uses muscle—
derived stem cells to repair muscle damage
primarily seen in soldiers.

Gharaibeh said his project’s funding is
safe because he uses adult stem cells.

“I’m one of the lucky guys,” he said.
“During my time at Pitt I have not had any
research altered by legislation.” I

Community members, city officials clash over party behavior

South Side 4 1 '

like revising the city’s noise ordinance. Others
are administrative, like determining where
arrested drunken people got their last drink
to help ﬁnd troublesome bars.

Members of the state Senate Law and]us-
tice Committee met Sept. 16 in the South Side
to discuss issues along the East Carson Street
stretch and how to stop — or at least lessen
— them.

Kraus was among those who testiﬁed about
the conditions, asking city and state officials
for advice on how to restore a certain level

A of order.

Kraus’ suggestions included gaining assis-
tance from the Pennsylvania State Police on
the weekend and limiting the number of bars.
Another option that Kraus discussed would
grant City Council the power to oversee liquor
license transfers within the city.

‘So when do we arrive at last call? Where
is the ‘little policeman’ on the shoulder of the
Pemisylvania Liquor Control Board whispering

responsibly in their ear, ‘The party’s over.’ When _

exactly is enough, enough?” Kraus said.

Jane Melchior, director of the Bureau of if

Licensing for the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board, also testiﬁed about the South Side’s is~.

, sues.

Melchior said that,the Pennsylvania Su-
preme Court does not allow the PLCB to revoke
a liquor license because of an adverse effect on
the neighborhood without direct proof.

“While at ﬁrst glance, it may appear that
the Board has signiﬁcant authority to refuse
an application, in reality it does not,” Melchior
said. i s

According to a2oo2 court ruling, the PLCB
can refuse an application to a previously unli-
censed location if granting the licence will have
a negative impact on the welfare, health, peace
and morals of the neighborhood. It may also

reﬁ_ise a license if a location is not currently li- V

censed andwithin 200 feetofanotherlicense or
 300 feet of a church, hospital, charitable
institution, school or playground. ’

Applicants who are refused a license may i

appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.
State Senatorjohn Pippy, chairman of the

State Senate Law andjustice Committee, sug- _

gested amending state law to impose a limit on
the number of liquor licenses in a neighbor,-
hood, but such a process is difficult because of
potential conﬂict with thestate constitution.

There have been three attempts to control
the number of liquor licenses in the South Side
since 1994 when there were 77. According to
city records, there are currently 147 liquor
licenses from Station Square to Southside

Problems down the road

People walked up and down East Carson Street
and occasionally stumbled off the sidewalks
into oncoming traffic.

“Hey, I have the right of way,” a girl shouted
at a car that almost hit her when crossing the
intersection. She happened to be crossing the
intersection diagonally through the middle
with vehicles going in all directions.

took him a couple minutes and several horn
blows at pedestrians just to parallel park.

“There are just way too many people wan-
dering inthe streets,”]ames said. “But how do
you ﬁx a problem like that?”

Outside of popular bars like Diesel and Villa,
people spill out into the streets in order to get
past the sidewalk packed with those waiting
in line. ,

Making my way back toward the bus stop, I
stopped at the corner of S. 19th and E. Carson
streets. There are two men playing instruments
and a small group gathered around.

The bus arrived at 1:47 a.m. This was the
last Port Authority bus that departs from the
South Side. I could have stayed for the encore
of people ﬂooding out of the bars. But maybe
it was best for my ownwell-being that I left the
area and waited for the police department to
release any reports about that night.

That is whenthe most property damage and
physical violence occurs, according to statistics
that Councilman Kraus assembled in his “Invit-

Label lies are no surprise

If you find yourself on your couch watch-
ing Teen Mom reruns with a pint of Kara-
mel Sutra Ben andJerry’s ice cream after a
particularly bad breakup, you’ll no longer
be fooled into thinking “at least what I’m

. eating islall natural.” '

After receiving a letter from a nonproﬁt
watchdog group earlier this month, Ben and

Jerry’s parent company, Unilever, agreed to 4

take the phrase “all natural” off the label,
according to the_,Huffington Post.

It turns out Ben and’jerry’s ice cream,
though delicious and available in unique

‘and bountiful ﬂavor combinations, is about A

as natural as Heidi Montag. The pints of
creamy goodness contain factory-made
ingredients like fake vanilla, alkalized co-

’ coa, corn syrup and partially hydrogenated

soybean oil. Appetizing, we, know.

So why was Ben and_]erry’s allowed use
with the “all natural” label for so long?

“Anyone can put the term ‘natural’ or
‘all natural’ on most foods, since the Food
and Drug Administration has no formal
deﬁnition of the term and doesn’t regulate
it or really police it,” the Huffington Post
reports. “So far, according to the agency,

it has ‘not objected to the use of the term if ‘

the food does not contain added color, arti-

9”

ﬁcial ﬂavors or synthetic substances.

It seems clear that Unilever was taking
advantage of the trend toward organic and
local food when labeling Ben and Jerry’s
ice cream as “all natural.” This would be
an honorable marketing strategy if the
products were actually all natural by the
common person’s definition of the term
— if the ice cream did not contain factory-
made ingredients.

Although we can’t exactly applaud Uni-
lever for using the “all natural” label in
the first place, we at least appreciate the
company’s willingness to remove it.

v In our ideal situation, , companies

wouldn’t make such claims on their labels I

if they also use factory—made ingredients.
The FDA would create stricter standards
and deﬁnitions of what is “natural” and “all
natural,” as well as regulating the term and
making sure it is not being misused.

But we have an even easier solution

‘Weeding’ out the problems Withlegalizing marijuana

Why the government should stop bashing hash already

Mark Kozlowski

» Columnist .

_ Quantum mechanics is the science of the truly

bizarre. All particles are waves at the same

' time, but whether we perceive one as a wave
_ or a particle is entirely dependent on the

experimentbeing done. Even weirder, things
can exist in multiple states at the same time,

‘and they only become one state when they-

are observed. Oh yeah, and this is the “easy”
introductory material gone over in the ﬁrst
two lectures. I maintain that people who at-
tempt to understand quantum mechanics are

either really good. at math or have a strong I

desire to do lots of pot. Unfortunately, the
latter is illegal in many places.

So I ask, is it just coincidence that Califor-
nia has produced many of the breakthroughs

in quantum mechanics and is also trying to
legalize marijuana? I think not. Proposition
19, a California ballot initiative, seeks to legal-
ize and regulate recreational marijuana. Polls
are all over the place. The Christian Science
Monitor reported 53 percent against on Oct.
6,‘but others say these polls are off, and the
initiative is likely to win. It’s about_time that
some state takes the step of legalization, and

that the United States makes marijuana legal ‘

at a federal level.

Some arguments against Prop. 19 say that
the plan will create a regulatory nightmare
because it allows individual counties to set
individual policies about marijuana. But, this
isn’t an unusual situation: Section 2 of the
21st Amendment, which repeals Prohibition,
explicitly allows local municipalities to ban
or regulate alcohol as they see fit. Indeed,
there still are “dry” counties and cities, coun-
ties where you can’t buy booze on Sunday

and states where alcohol can only be bought
from state stores. We have somehow man-
aged to muddle through with a patchwork
of alcohol regulations. Why should pot be
any different?‘

Other arguments against marijuana re-
volve around the ill effects of the drug like
addiction and impairment. Essentially, the
drug is bad for your health. But then again, so
is excessive coffee, which is addictive, causes

_ high blood pressure and creates a depen-

dency; when a brain becomes accustomed to

, a certain" level of caffeine, it doesn’t function
' normally unless that amount is present. The

ill effects of tobacco are well known. Alcohol
can be addictive, with sometimes fatal with-
drawal symptoms, and leads to bad health ef-
fects ranging from getting burned by ﬂaming
couches in the streets of Oakland to cirrhosis
of the liver. In fact, the bad health effects and

. lost productivity caused by the ravishes of

alcohol led to an experiment with Prohibi-
tion, and we know how that one turned out.
Sex transmits STDs. Listening to rap music
was “strongly linked” to increased drugand
alcohol abuse, as well as violence, according
to NPR. Yet these aren’t illegal. Why?

Even if we concede marijuana is the worst
drug in the world —- which it isn’t — is it re-
ally the govemment’s business to punish its
recreational use? I’m not arguing that driving
under theinﬂuence of marijuana should be
legal. If a corporation doesn’t want to hire
people that smoke marijuana, that’s its busi-
ness. If the government \wants to enforce
sobriety among its own workers, so be it.
But why should the government prosecute a
guy who smokes a joint in the comfort of his
own home, then eats all the peanut butter
in his house whilestaring at his ﬁngernails,

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Single graduates notdoomed to life alone I

No signiﬁcant other by senior year? No problem.

Leah Trimble
Columnist

Qh, how I miss my teenage years.just kid-
ding. I -

months into my second decade, barely 20
in the midst of my junior year, I’ve come
to the conclusion that I’ve never been in
an adult relationship. Both of my past re-
lationships were in high school —— one was
rather lengthy and the other was more of
a ﬂing. _

After my second attempt at a commit-
ment, elders who would ask my relation-
fshiplstatus would, commend me for staying
.{s-ingle, praising me for my good judgment

, and reluctance to get serious. I agreed.

Though most of my already tied—down
friends tried to stay together in different
colleges, I chose to have the “college experi-
ence.” I went out to both school and social
events, met a ton of friends, and even some
very cute guys. A nice pat on the back for
me  at least, I think.

Unfortunately, it seems those days of
status disregard have come to an end. Ev-

Despite the fact that I am only two

ery time I make a visit home, my mother
asks me if “I’ve met any nice men.” Though

she would never make fun of my life deci— V

sions, I know she is secretly hoping that
I’ll partner up.

Enter my sister and her ﬁancé. At this
point in time, she’s questioned my every
move with men. Why not him? Wasn’t he
good enough? How about I set you up with
him? She yells at me for being too picky
-— I’m sorry if I can’t date a guy that has a
dip in every half hour. Yet of the ones I’ve
considered, none have been approved.

Apparently noticing my increasing

academic seniority, they sat me down and '

gave me a little ad,vice,,or' in my mind, _a
 me that I should “start

two’-‘be more open to'd'atin’g” because evi- ‘

dently everyone “meets who they’re going
to be with during their college years” and
they don’t want me to end up alone. They
were genuinely worried about my future
well-being.

They weren’t the only ones.

One of my best friends, who was, un-
til recently, notoriously single, told me of
his similar set of worries the next time he

was with me. Is this the freakin’ “Ghost of

Freshmen Past” trying to punish me for
exploring my options instead of dabbling
in the dating world? ' f

So, based on these, am I, and all of you
lovely, currently single readers, doomed to
a life of loneliness if college ends and our
single-dom doesn’t?

I will be honest and admit that most of
my married friends are a product of college
dating. But if I follow a traditional perspec-
tive, this is the person I’m supposed to stay
with for the rest of my life.

According to the 2010 Census, 1, a white
female, still have about 60 years left, due
to croak around the ripe age of 80. Assum-
ing I leave out everything previous to Pitt,

A I have to sort through all these possible

partners in four or ﬁve years —— right now.
I’ll say that the people getting their gradu-
ate and doctoral degrees are cheating to get
a deadline extension. That’s a lot of time
constraint to ﬁnd someone worth living
with for 60 years.

Obviously I am determined to prove
that, although convenient, meeting some-
one in this stage of our life is unnecessary

. and distracting. Looking at the statistics

nationwide, I found a recentstudy done by

Match.com. The website questioned 7,000
married couples on their initial meeting
place. Of these, only 27 percent met through
school. Yup, take that, naysayers.

In fact, the biggest chunk of these cou-
ples met through friends or family, equaling
a total of 38 percent. So for those of you
looking for a lover, force your friends to
set you up with their closest single hotties

and hunks. The more the merrier, right? «

Let your cousin bring his or her friend to
the next Pitt football game and seat them
next to you. Hey, you never knew.

For those of you that don’t really give a
crap about settling down, don’t let anyone
make you feel different. I made that mis-
take. Lesson learned. Take your time and
follow your own path to ﬁnding “the one,”
if that’s the future you even desire. I refuse
to let people convert me into being a fan of
relationships.

No matter what your relationship status ‘

is, be true to yourself in what you want. Tell
everyone else to mind their own business,
and ignore all those stupid statistics. It’s
your life, and you have the right to be in
whatever percentage you choose.

Even presidents have   admittedexperimenting with pot

pondering the meaning of the universe?
The government should not concern itself
with matters that almost never affect any-
one but the person performing the act. The
government is here to prevent people from
harming each other and securing the rights
of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
If the government were to concern itselfwith
protecting people from the consequences of
their own actions, we would no longer be free.
Freedom is partly the right to do things oth-
ers might consider stupid and should only be
limited to the extent that the actions interfere

with others.

There is another problem. Marijuana laws,
as they are currently enforced, are kind of
a joke. I’d either be a liar or a very strange
college student to say I haven’t seen some-
body who was high. Ann Arbor, Mich., hosts
an annual “hash bash” where you can buy
joints, bongs and so forth frompeople doing
business on a public street in broad daylight
several blocks from the county courthouse.
Get cited on city property and the ﬁne is a
whopping 25 bucks. Heck, we’ve even had two
presidents who have admitted to experiment-

p ing with marijuana in front of video cameras,

with Bill Clinton famously “not inhaling” and
President Obama “inhaling frequently, that
was the point.”

So there you have it. Doing something
illegal doesn’t always disqualify you from
holding an office of public trust if that illegal
something is using marijuana. This encour-
ages disrespect for the rule of law.

Remove the illegality, and you remove
some of the cachet of doing drugs, as well
as the contempt for the law resulting from
getting away with lawbreaking.

True, one could say the same thing about
shoplifting, in that not all shoplifters are
caught, and it isn’t taken as seriously. This
doesn’t mean we should make theft legal. But
there’s a big difference: There is a lot of social
opprobrium attached to stealing, in pretty

- much every religion, culture, time and place.

Pot, however, hardly has the same stigma.
We haven’t even considered practical, eco-
nomic reasons for legalization of marijuana.
Stay tuned for a column yet to come.

» March to Keep Fear Alive

Oct. 30, noon to 3 p.m.
National Mall, Washington

Although -lately the United States seems beset
by trouble, Stephen Colbert has faith in that
most timeless American sentiment: fear.

“The ﬁght-or-ﬂight response is why our
ancestors survived and other lines of hu-
manity died out,” Colbert said. “We knew to
be afraid of snakes. The people who didn’t
know to be afraid of snakes did not get to
have children.”

\_A mostly in—character Colbert offered
these quips and others during a Friday con-
ference call with student journalists in sup-
port of his March to Keep Fear Alive —— a
tongue-in-cheek gathering on the National
Mall to complement Jon Stewart’s Rally ‘to
Restore Sanity at the same place and time.

“This is not going to be a religious event,”
Colbert said of his march. “I ﬁnd God to be
too soothing and calming.”

He did, however, hope his participants
would be fervent. . V

“I want [people] to be acting out'ofemo—
tion and not out of reason,” Colbert said.
“Rationality gets you things like the atomic
bomb. That’s what logic will get you. Whereas
fearing the atomic bomb is the thing that
kept us safe during the Cold War.”

Colbert said he was nostalgic for the time
when fear was omnipresent, and Americans
knew they lingered on the brink of destruc-
tion. .

“Back [when I was an undergrad] the fear
was nuclear annihilation from the Russians,”
Colbert said. “I and so many of our friends
had nightmares that that’s how we were go-
ing to die —- that Reagan was going to go toe-
to—toe with Gorbachev and push the button.
That was the biggest fear.” A b

After a moment, he added, “Oh, and
AIDS!’’ , ‘

 Colbert said an acute sense of “the other”
is essential for a healthy anxiety.

“If you drop your fear of our enemies ——
who can be internal or external — people
become complacent and make their deci-
sions through reason,” he cautioned.

For better or for worse, Colbert said he I

didn’t think the ﬁnancial crisis has triggered
such rationality. I

“All these houses are being foreclosed.
The government is trying to stop banks from
foreclosing houses and everybody’s afraid
that if we don’t foreclose houses just as fast

as we started funding these houses, then

Pittsburgh might have professional sports teams,
gveatuniversiﬁes and vibrant neighborhoods, but
until recently, it lacked one ingredient: a public
market.

The newPittsburgh Public Marketattemptsto —

ﬁll this niche. Located within an old warehouse,
it’s theﬁrstmarket of its kindinPil1sburgh since
1965, accordingto manager Cindy Cassell.
“This is Pittsburglfs historic market district
Wethoughtthis was a nice complement to what
the Strip offers,” Cassell said. “Mostmajorcities
have public markets. Other markets are found in
old terminal-type buildings. The buildings lend
themselves to the historic market concept.”

The team studied other public markets to '

see what amenities were often included. Cassell
discovered that other markets were “often the
hearts and souls of the community.”

“They were gatheringplaces,” she said. “Peo-
ple enjoy that. There are great products. They’re
supporting the local economy and agriculture.
Markets are a wonderful way to showcase the

_ best of what the region offers, because they do

offer local products and local farms.”

The businesses featured in the market are
locallyowned and operated, althoughtheysome-
ﬁmes include vendors from outside ofPittsburgh
who have teamed up with local businesses, offer-
ingwhat Cassell deemedjthe “best [products] in
the region.”

The Produce Terminal, where the market
is located, is an old warehouse-like structure
with plasteredwalls, anoverhead mof and doors
thatare open or shut depending on the weather
outside. .

‘ Visitors can stroll down aisle alter aisle and
fromvendorto vendor. Cooking demonstrations
or-band performances take place in a corner
near chairs and tables, keeping the energy and

noise levels high.

The whole building is‘ a collage of smells,
from fresh ﬁuits and baked bread to juicy ribs
and greasy potatoes. People chit-chat between
stands, and it isn’t uncommon to hear excited
conversation about how a_sample tastes.

The market features organic produce, a bak-
ery,jewel1y and a pet food and toy stand. There
arealsotwo Indian food vendors, which the Strip
District formerly lacked, Cassell said. '

“We approvethingsbased on howthe product
adds diversity to the market as well as the entire
Strip,” Cassell said.

Severalfeatuned vendors arenew orhadorigi-
nally been based at home before coming to the
market. Cassell said she hopes other businesses
willfollow suit. . '

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Secretariat’ triumphs

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

‘ “Secretariat”

Starring: Diane Lane, John Malkovich,

I Amanda Michalka

Director: Randall Wallace _
Walt Disney Pictures/ Mayhem Pictures
Grade: B

Horseracing fans, take heed: “Secretariat” is
more than just a day at the races, ‘

Z Disney’s newest ﬁlm is a surprisingtour-de-
force, with an impressive combination of good
acting and deft cinematography that brings a

V h_orse galloping down the track to life.

The ﬁlmis based on the true story of Secre-
tariat, athoroughbredracehorse who in 1973
became the ﬁrst Triple Crown champion in
25 years and set track records that still stand
today.

The story begins before the racehorse’s
birth, when its owner-to—be, Penny Chenery
(Diane Lane), takes over her parents’ failing
breeding farm upon the death of her mother.
She tells her husband and children she’ll re-
turn home in a few days. Days, however, turn
into weeks as she grows attached to the farm
and feelsuobligated to solve its problems —

entire property.

Soon, Chenery ﬁnds herselfwith a young
colt the stable hands call Big Red, who has fos-
tered a love for running early in life. A trainer
named Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), who
has afondness for odd clothing styles and just
can’t retire, accompanies the horse.

At the same time her family is growing up
and joining war protests without her, Chenery

works hard to give Big Red, whose race name

becomes Secretariat, a ﬁghting chance to run
his race.

The actors’ performances are quite strong
throughout. For a ﬁlm about a racéhorse, the
audience will be just as invested in the charac-
ters as the ﬁlm’s myriad conﬂicts — conﬂicts
which include keeping control of a breedirig
farm and letting go of past mistakes.

Lane presents Chenery as a powerful,
free—wil1ed housewife ﬁghting for what she
wants in both worlds —— a compelling oddity
given the male—dominated society she lives
in. Malkovich brings most of the humor to
the screen in his portrayal of an aging man
with a curmudgeon attitude and an unusual
sense of style.

The animals give their own laudable per-
formances. Apparently a horse wrangler from

ation —- they’re being made through fear,”
he said.

When one journalist remarked that these
all sounded like poor decisions, Colbert
countered that, “They get stuff done.”

“I don’t know if you’ve ever had a term
paper or a paper due the next day — you
know, an overnight wonder that you’ve writ-
ten at school,” he continued. “You got that

of not getting it done.”

Lengthy analogies aside, many of Col-
bert’s responses were one—liners: If he had to
dress up as his biggest fear, as he instructed
his rally’s participants to do, what would his
costume be?

“Is it possible to dress up as a mosque?”

What was his biggest fear?

“Bears. They’re godless killing ma-
chines.”

Wouldn’t it be a more effective rally if he

and Stewart teamed up?

“Oh my God, you’ve convinced me!”

Whilelighthearted throughout, Colbert
brieﬂy seguedl out of character to champion
DonorsChoose.org, a charity organization
in which schools request funding for certain
projects and donors give them amounts of
their choosing. Colbert is on the organiza-
tion’s board of directors.

. and so clear how it’s helping.”

As for Colbert and Stewart’s dual gather-
ings, Pitt students had divergent views on
their merits. Some praised their intentions,
but others thought they trivialized serious
issues.

“I think it’s overblown,”Jordan Fremuth,
a senior English literature and writing major,
said of the assemblies. “Although [Stewart
and Colbert] are legitimate members of the
media, I think the way in which they ap-
proach these events belittles it. A national
identity is a problem right nowibecause we
don’t have one. joking about it isn’t going
to solve anything.”

Chunrong Chen, a political science Ph.D.
candidate, had a more positive outlook.

“I think this kind of rally can bring politi-
cal awareness,” Chen said, with the qualiﬁ-

cation that rallies of such magnitude raise I

“logistical” and ﬁnancial concerns.
Jesse Horst, a graduate student in the

h_istory department, thought the rallies were
a good idea but remarked that, “Jon Stewart
needs to develop his own kind of platform.

Simkin: Infused water a simple pleasure

Food columnist Sarah Simkin explores the merits and applications of an exciting new trend: 1',ngredient—infused water.

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

I first encountered infused water at the

café in the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
where I not unreasonably assumed the

apple slivers ﬂoating in the water pitcher _

were some type of aesthetic statement.
But when infused water popped up again
at Market Central’s new “Hydration Sta-
tion,” I began to suspect that there might
be more to it. .

A little research revealed the afore-
mentioned beverages to be not unlike
aguas frescas, a common accompani-
ment to meals in some types of Mexican
and Central American cuisine: lighter
than fruitjuice but with a dazzle ofﬂa—
vor that plain water can’t compete with.

Infused water is also frequently served-

at spas and salons where tap waterjust
wouldn’t be trendy or classy enough. -

Making infused water is so ridicu-
lously easy that one can barely classify
it as food preparation. Yet it’s simultane-
ously fun and, under the right circum-
stances, potentially impressive.. Can it
be accomplished in a dorm room? Ifyou
have a mini—fridge and a Brita filter, or
any other form of water pitcher, it’s most
definitely possible.

Simply cut up your chosen ingredi-
ents, add them to the water, and chill
the mixture for a few hours, or take a cue
from the book ofTexas sun tea and leave
it on a sunny window sill before serving
over ice. You can serve the drink‘ with
the fruit or vegetable segments floating
in the drink or strain them out. You can
also add fresh slices — throwing a lemon

or a lime into a beverage is a mainstream V

classic, but what about grapefruit, a cu-
cumber wedge or a strawberry?

Experiment with a single fruit or-
vegetable or get creative with ﬂowers,
herbs or combinations like orange mint,
pineapple chipotle mint, watermelon
basil and lemon lavender. One compli-
cated recipe calls for 12 cucumber slices,
four lemon slices, four sprigs of fresh
mint and two sprigs of fresh rosemary
— you can buy. fresh herbs at most gro-
cery stores.

Think some of those concoctions
sound outlandish? Me too, though
many ‘a website and online commenter
sing their praises. I’d rather stick with

classics like cucumber or cranberry?

raspberry. 1

Trading still water for sparkling can
also add a twist, though be careful not
to lose your carbonation while your in-
gredients infuse. You could also experi-

ment with sugar or artificial sweeteners.
I’ve arrived at some interesting'conco_c-
tions with agave nectar, not the least
of which included a ﬂavoring in virgin
margaritas. ' ..
Some variations feature the additio
of fruit purees, but that would involve
a food processor and is practically a

smoothie, and we aren’t venturing out
into other beverage realms here.
Infused water could conceivably
take the placebof sugary sodas or en-
ergy drinks or at least serve as an oc-
casional substitute for them. Whereas
the transfer of ﬂavor to the H20 likely
does not confer great quantities of nu-

‘I’-

tritional value to the beverage, it still
doesn’t contain nearly as many sugar,
calories, carbohydrates or any ofthosg
other health-conscious buzzterms.

If you’re committed to hydration and
looking for a fun way to knock back those
eight glasses ofwater a day, infused wa-
ter might just be worth a try.

MEN'S SOCCER

Panthers battle Marquette to a tie

Ohad Ca I Visual Edit

Pitt’s Sam Luffy (No. 4) looks to make a play against Duquesne earlier in the season. He scored a goal against Marquette to tie the

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team took its ﬁrst lead in Big
East play this year — and then saw it evapo-
rate. ’
.5; The Panthers scored on theirﬁrst two shots,
but Marquette’s offense and an untimely red
' card helped the Golden Eagles battle back to a
2-2 tie Saturday afternoon at Founders Field.

“Itwas a hard-fought game from the get—go.
I thought in the ﬁrst half we played very well,”
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher said. “All of a

' sudden, we were down to 10 men, and then we
really scrambled. They’re apretty good team,
and we were trying to survive.”

Pitt led 2-1 in the 63rd minute when an
official issued defender Connor Malone a red
card after a hard tackle on Marquette’s Calum

r~fMallace. Six minutes later and with Pitt a man
down, Bryan Ciesiulka took a pass from Mal-
lace and struck a shot off the post and into the
goal to knot the game. .

Luxbacher said he wasn’t happy with the
red card.

“Itwas afoul,” he said. “Malone went after

the ball near midﬁeld on one of their guys, A

and [they] collided and both went down. I
couldn’t believe the official red—carded him

immediately. At worst, that would be a yellow
card warning.”

Sides evened out in the 87th minute when
Marquette’s Eric Pothast earned his second
yellow card of the night in the foul—ﬁlled affair,

but by then Pitt’s early lead had disappeared. '

The Panthers had ﬁnally built a two-goal lead
by burying their chances. . V

“It was nice to score some goals,” Lux-
bacher said. Pitt had been shut out in ﬁve of
its previous six games.

In the 15th minute, Pitt scored on its ﬁrst
shot of the afternoon when freshman Alex
Grayson buried a loose ball in the box for his
ﬁrst career goal. Luxbacher said that the pro-
gram recruited Grayson hoping for goals, but
he had struggled to do so up to that point.

“He’s a guy who has the ability to score
goals,” he said. “He just hasn’t done it this year.
Today he broke out a bit.” ‘

One shot and eight minutes later, Grayson
generated another scoring chance when he
found Sam Luffy at the back post. Lufly headed
it in for his third goal of the year and put Pitt
up, 2-0, at the half.

“In the tough games we’ve played this year,
we’ve been down in the ﬁrst half, so it was nice
to get up early and go into halftime up two
goals,” Luffy said.

Luffy tied fellow senior Alex Betancourt’s

team lead in points.-

team-leading seven points with the goal.
Despite the halftime score, Marquette out-

shot and out—cornered Pitt in the opening half,

and the Golden Eagles ﬁnally got one by, Pitt

goalkeeper Hami Kara in the 56th minute. ’

Kara had made three saves on the night before
Teejay East beat him with a low, hard shot.
i “I don’t know if he was screened or if he

. didn’texpectthe guy to shoot,” Luxbacher said.

“He looked like he didn’t see it right away.”
Luxbacher, though, said that Kara had no
chance on the second goal, and that he played
well after freshman Matt Aberegg started in his
place Wednesday at Cleveland State.
Meanwhile, defenders Alex Harrison and
senior captain.Andy Kalas played all 110 min-
utes against Marquette. ,
Harrison, despite not being fully healthy,
had a chance at the golden goal in the 107th
minute, but his header went high.
“We didn’t know if he could play or not until

- before the game,” Luxbacher said. “He battled,

and he was a key man in there for us. He deﬁ-
nitely was not healthy, but he played.”

Pitt outshot Marquette, 4-1, in the two over-
time periods. Golden Eagle goalkeeper David
Check had to make two saves in the game’s ﬁnal
10 minutes to hold off the Panthers.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

Pitt loses, ties

Team gets one point over the weekend ..

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Stajf Writer

The Pitt women’s soccer team entered the week-

end with the chance to move up in the Big East

standings, but missed opportunities and mental
lapses proved costly as the Panthers earned only
one point between its two games — one against
St.John’s and the other against Syracuse.

_ Pitt head coach Sue-Moy Chin said she talked
with the team about capitalizing on opportunities
before the game against Syracuse on Sunday.

“We did a good job of it in the ﬁrst half, and
then we relaxed a little bit too much,” Chin said.
“That’s goingto beafocus, butalso cleaningup our
mistakes in the back and working on concentra-
tion toward the end of tlie games.”

The top ﬁve teams in each Big ‘East division
qualify for the Big East tournament. Right now,
the Pittwomen’s soccer team is in eighth place in
the American division.

With the opportunity to pick up points over
the weekend, the Panthers fell to St. John’s and

n _ tied Syracuse.Avicto1y overthe Orangewould’ve

given Pitt three points, moving the team into atie
with its opponent. ‘Instead, the Panthers earned

one point and remain in last place, three points -

behind the Orange and ﬁve points behind Provi-
dence and South Florida. ‘

Pitt’s Ashley Cuba said the Panthers aren’t ‘

giving up on their goal of advancing to the Big
East tournament, adding that ifPittwins its ﬁnal
four Big East games, they’ll be in a good position
to qualify-

“We justneed to keep our heads,” she said.
“We’re not done trying to qualify for the Big East
tournament.”

St.John’s 1, Pitt 0

During the ﬁrst 45 minutes against St. John’s,
Panther goalkeeper Morie Kephart stopped all
ﬁve Red Storm shots, giving Pitt a chance to take
the lead. '

“They brought a lot of pressure early,” Chin

said. “But we were able to sustain to go into the s

halfat 0-0. Then, we brought a lot of pressure in
the secondhalf. We created opportunities, butwe
were unable to score.” . -

Early in the second half, the Panthers took
three of the ﬁrst four shots, looking to get on the
board ﬁrst. But it was St. John’s that broke the
scoreless tie in the 66th minute.

Anna Torregiano passed to midﬁelder Amy
Marron, who faked _right and ﬁred a shot under
the crossbar from the top of the box. Marron’s
third goal of the season was enough to hand St.

Teams that should join Big East

Tonyjovenitti

Let’s talk about Big East football. But you
have to stop laughing ﬁrst.
Yeah, we all know the Big East is awful.

Through the non-conference part of the sea— W

son, teams in the conference stumbled to a
pathetic 23-15 record. Changes are clearly
needed. So, for my top 10 this week, I give you
teams the Big East should add in football. I

ingless hurdles such as contractual obliga-
tions, geography or the fact that there are

purely wishful thinking.

Appalachian State. Let’s

teams that would be willing to join the “Big
Least,” so the conference is going to have to
look elsewhere. Appalachian State is a great
place to start. It has one of the most" consis-

team called the Mountaineers, and even that
is a little much. ~ ,

FOOTBALL

Panthers drop to 2-3 with loss to Fighting Irish

Dustin Gabler
For the Pitt News

This is not the way the Pitt football team envi-
sioned its season starting.

Now at 2-3, after losing 23-17 at Notre Dame
on Saturday, the Panthers, who were ranked

"No. 15 in the preseason, must prepare for Big
East play.

Head coach Dave Warmstedt’s team came
out of the gate looking strong on Saturday. The
defense forced athree and out series and turned
the ball over to the offense. Quarterback Tino
Sunseri led his offense down the ﬁeld, but Pitt
was forced to settle for a Dan Hutchins 26-yard
ﬁeld goal. —- ’

“We’ve got to ﬁnish. We’re moving the ball,
but we’re just killing ourselves,” running back
Dion Lewis said. “When we get down there we’ve

got to get hungry and just want to score touch-
downs instead of settling for ﬁeld goals.”

Lewis ran for 63 yards on 13 attempts while
fellow runningback Ray Graham gained44 yards
on eight carries.

“You want to score every time. Sometimes
you come up short,” receiverjon Baldwin said.
“You’ve got to keep working hard at it and
maybe next time we’ll connect on those touch-
downs.”

Baldwin had one of his best games of the

the fact that Buffalo is an untapped college

football market. Western New York has no

difficult to develop a rivalry between West

Virginia and East Carolina. And the Big East
could use a team called the Pirates.
Delaware. Like Appalachian
7 State, Delaware has become an
0 FCS powerhouse. The Blue Hens
are currently ranked No. 2 behind the Moun-
taineers. Delaware would ﬁt in geographi-
cally, and it is the only team in the state of

dedicated if the Blue Hens joined the FBS.
Temple. Yes, the Owls have been
6 a laughing stock over the past
0 few years —— please hold back
the “then they would ﬁt in with the Big East”
jokes. But this year, Temple is actually hav-
ing a good season. The Owls are 4-2. They
defeated Connecticut and gave Penn State
a run for its money. Philadelphia, much like

Buffalo, is also an untapped BCS football —

market.

Villanova. The Big East actually
gave Villanova an invitation into
0 the conference in football. There

are a lot of details that need to be worked out,
but the Wildcats would be a nice addition
to the conference. As a Big East basketball
school, it already has a rivalry with most

takes, and they tied the game. It was very, very

A disappointing.”

Neither team was able to sco -‘e in overtime.
Pitt had three shots on goal and four comer kicks
in the ﬁrst overtime, and both teams registered
solid scoring opportunities in the second over-
time. _ .

Chin said the team responded well in over-
time, creatingsome solid scoring opportunities.
But she said the Panthers need to work on shoot-
ing the ball low so the goalkeeperhas to go down
and make the save. Cuba said the Panthers also
need to improve on being prepared to shoot. T

“We just need to be ready for the ball when it
comes to us,” Cuba said. “We just need to be more
ready inthe boxto ﬁnis ” _

Ruhe led the Panthers withthreeshots,two on
goal. Kephart made eight saves in the game. I

second half it shows ﬂashes, but it all doesn’t
really matter if you let up points like that in the
ﬁrst half.” - '

Pitt scored late inthe third quarter onagutsy
4-yard run by Sunseri, who completed 27 of 39
passes for 272 yards with an interception and
two total touchdowns. '

Wannstedt continued to explain that Sun-
seri’s maturation will be a process, but he feels
that he made good decisions throughout the
game, evidenced by when he‘ connected withjon
Baldwin for a big 56-yard touchdown.

“We talked about that probably day one
of training camp -— scrambles. Baldwin is a
smart guy, as soon as he saw me break contain

then he understood that he needed to run the '

go route, and he did that, and he was open and

I just wanted to be sure that he got the ballj’, ‘

Sunseri said. . »

The Panthers got the ball back late in the
fourth quaiterbutwerenit able to sustain adrive.
The Irish secondary broke up Sunseri’s fourth
down throw to Baldwin.

Pittwill not be able to hang its head, as con-
ference play starts this week. The team travels
to Syracuse, N.Y., to take on the surprising 41
(1-0) Syracuse Orange at noon Saturday. I
