Founders Day
participants  
debate health
care in US.

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Questions regarding the feasibility of a
national health—care system still remain in
the minds of many, and this was demon-
strated by speakers at yesterdays Founders’
Day Symposium in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room.

According to Dr. William L. Kissick, pro-
fessor of health care systems at the
University of Pennsylvania, the United
States is not able to provide high-quality,
low-cost health care to everyone due to the
economic concept of scarcity.

“I have [seen] medicine's dilemmas that

are derived from the confrontation between

infinite needs and finite resources,” Kissick
said. “No society in the world has sufficient
resources to provide all of the health ser—
vices its population could utilize.”

Kissick said a poll of 1,250 Americans
taken during the last presidential campaign
revealed that Americans wanted quality
health care for everyone at a controlled
cost, with an unlimited choice of physicians
and hospitals.

He said the contrast between the poll’s
results and the concept of scarcity leads to
conflicts turning the health—care issue into
“a contact sport.”

According to Kissick, the United States’
expenditures on health care are increasing
drastically, with no apparent end in sight.

“Before the end of this year, we will pass
$1 trillion in health care costs, en route to
some $2 trillion early in the next century,”
Kissick said. “If so, that will be three times
as much as we spend on education.”

Kissick said such generous spending on
medical care may not be a good idea if it
causes less money to be spent on other
important concerns.

“I predict that early in the 21st century,
the United States will have the first well-
medicated, illiterate labor force serving
french fries to each other under the golden
arches,” Kissick said.

Kissick said in order for any health—care
system to work, it must allow citizens to
retain control of their medical coverage.

“To manage or to be managed: that is the
question,” Kissick said. “The argument falls
very heavily on the side of being the man-

“They treated a sick, young English

Senatorial candidate Santorum addresses College Republicans

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Promising to avoid “a health
care program modeled after the
welfare program that we know
doesn’t work,” Pennsylvania
Representative Rick Santorum
spoke at last night’s College
Republicans meeting.

Santorum, who is bidding to
run against Democratic incum-
bent Pennsylvania Senator

Harris Wofford, highlighted his
plans to improve the health—care
system currently in place.

“I'm the prime Republican
leader of health—care reform,”
Santorum said. “I’m going to
focus on the issues  what’s
important to Americans and
not what’s important to politi-
cians.”

Santorum said the current
health-care plan is not fair to all
Americans since everyone is

required to pay the same
amount for non—emergency
medical care.

“The lcurrentl plan is an
opportunity killer,” Santorum
said.

“Whether you’re a 55-year-old
smoker or a 19—year—old track
star, you pay the same,” he
said.

Santorum said access to
health ‘insurance is the key to a
successful health-care system.

According to Santorum, 15
percent of Americans and 8.4
percent of Pennsylvanians are
currently uninsured. Santorum
said even the so-called
“employer mandate,” which
requires companies to pay for
employees’ health insurance
costs, does not guarantee med-
ical coverage for all working
Americans.

“Even after [the employee
mandatel is implemented, 5-4

percent of the people would
still be uninsured,” he said.

Under Santorum’s new
“Medisave” program proposal,
citizens would be required to
pay a higher insurance
deductible but would receive
any unspent money from their
medical coverage.

Santorum said the plan will
be more accessible since citi-
zens can eventually get some of

Major to Pittsburgh when he
heard that Major had local roots.
Their itinerary last night includ-
ed a visit to Mt. Washington
after the rally for a working din-
ner overlooking a special light-
up night downtown.

Major said he knew of
Pittsburgh through stories told
to him as a child.

“Stories of how my father
remembers my grandfather
being here working in the
Carnegie Steel Plant way back
in the 18605 and 1870s, and
how my father spent a period of
his youth here,” Major said.

Clinton emphasized the
growth and importance of
Pittsburgh through the last cen-
tury.

“When John Major’s grandfa-
ther and father were here, this
city was the heart of America’s
industrial might,” Clinton said.
“Today it’s the center of its high
technology and economic inno-
vations.”

“It’s a city of the future as well
as a city with a past,” Clinton
said.

Both speeches focused on the
relationship of the United States
and Great Britain also building
on the past.

“We worked together for a
new world-trade agreement to
bring down trade barriers and
open world markets to the
products that American workers
make,” Clinton said.

Clinton said the two countries
are working together to unify
Europe in peace and democra-
cy, in order to make the world
saferfor decades to come. Both
Clinton and Major addressed
the current conﬂict in Bosnia.

“We’re working together  to
try to bring an end to the killing
and to bring peace and to keep
that conflict from spreading in
ways that could threaten the
interests of the‘ United States
and Great Britain,” Clinton said,
“as well as the conscience of the
civilized world.”

Major said he agrees “firm
action is right  We’ll be look-
ing to see how we can increase
the pressure for the peace that
every sensible person wishes to
see  Major said.

Major said earlier in the day
he and Clinton sent a joint mes-
sage to South Africa for Nelson
Mandela and Chief Buthelezi.

“[They] are holding a crucial
meeting tomorrow that may
have great importance as the
South Africans move towards
their first multiracial elections,”
Major said. '

Clinton and Major also said
they were working together to
insure the progress of post
Cold-War democratic reform.

“A Russia that’s a good neigh-
bor to the United States and the
West would be one of the finest
things that this generation could
hand down to the next,” Major
said. _

After the rally, Clinton, Major
and other officials shook hands
and spoke with the invitation-

only crowd of several hundred
people.

One spectator, Kristen
Werner, said she had heard
“how nice Clinton was” from
a teacher who received an
education award from him last
yean

“And now this year he shook
my hand,” Werner said. “I think
his speech was great.”

“I thought [Clinton] had a
good ability of moving the
crowd and bringing them into
his speech,” said Harry Baturin,
a Pitt student who interns at
Pennsylvania Sen. Harris
Wofford’s Pittsburgh office.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor was also complimen-
tary of the speeches.

“It was a very affectionate,
warm statement about
Pittsburgh and the relationship
the Prime Minister had in partic-
ular with the care he found
from [Pitt] surgeons and health-
care team at Children’s
Hospital,” O’Connor said.

“The bottom‘ line here is
responsibility,” Santorum said.
“You will be an informed con-
sumer.”

Santorum said current govern-
ment health—care programs,
such as the one used in Canada,
can produce catastrophic
results.

Under the Canadian program.
according to Santorum, each
province is told how much
money it can spend on health
care.

If a province runs out of fund-
ing before the end of the year. it
is required to shut down all of
its hospital services except for
child deliveries, emergency and
trauma units.

“Anyone who tells you [a plan
such as Canada’sl won't lead to
rationing is doing one thing,
lying,” Santonim said.

Eric Lurie of the College
Republicans said Santorum
offered some fresh ideas on the

seemingly stagnant health-care
topic currently being debated in
the nation.

“Change is one thing, but
progress is another,” Lurie
said.

"Progress is what Rick
Santorum is about, progress is
what Rick Santomm has fought
for in Congress and progress is
what Rick Santorum is going to
fight for in the Senate."

Santorum, currently a state
representative from \iC"estern
Pennsylvania, is currently on
the Ways and Means Committee
of the House Senate.

Santorum received his
Master's of Business
Administration from the.
University of Pittsburgh's Kat’/.

1981. Along with his M.B.A.,
Santoruin has a law degree
from Dickinson School of

Fund’s health division, the issue
of how to provide medical care
for all children is another cru-
cial medical dilemma.

“Children have no [voting
power] and no money, and that
equals powerlessness in this
society,” Hackney said.

According to Hackney, the
number of children covered by
health insurance dropped from
61 percent in 1988 to 57 per-
cent in 1992.

“Children have to be treated
in the context of the family,”
Hackney said.

“It's hard to do a comprehen-
sive health-care program when
you only do it for part of the
population.”

Hackney said Bill Clinton's
health care program is one of
the more comprehensive pro-
posals she has seen, since its
focus is on health-problem pre-
vention rather than crisis treat-
ment.

She,also said, however, the

Clinton plan fails to address the
issue of care for children with
birth defects.

“In the Clinton bill, some of
the language excludes children
who have developmental and
congenital birth defects from
getting services,” Hackney said.

“Giving health care to chil-
dren is one of the best invest-
ments one can make,” she
added.

Judith R. Lave, Professor of
Health Economics at Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public
Health, said the best way to
improve children’s health care
is not necessarily through more
policies but through education.

“I think if you’re really inter-
ested in the health care of our
kids, expanding medical ser-
vices is not the best way to get
there,” Lave said.

“Probably the best way to
improve the health care of our
children is to do a good job of
educating their parents.”

Orwells nightmare is F.B.I. ’s dream

If you thought George Orwell’s vision of utopia was
ambrosial and were eagerly looking forward to 1984,
then you’re going to love what the government has in
mind for 1994. It seems Orwell missed the date by one
decade, but his dream of a society closely monitored
by technology came one step closer to reality when
the Clinton Administration proposed legislation which
would allow law enforcement officers to “gather a
wealth of personal information by monitoring citizen’s
calling patterns and credit card transactions over the
telephone network —_and over the two-way cable
television networks being planned by cable and phone
companies” (The New Yorle Times, Feb. 28, 1994).

This law will put technology in place which will give
agencies such as the FBI access to telecommunications
networks (i.e. E—mail, telephones, cellular phones, etc.)

That’s right folks, the government may soon be
watching you, knowing who you called and how you
handle your money. They may want to see you when
you’re sleeping and know when you’re awake, but
you can bet that a jolly old elf won’t be sliding down
your chimney to fill a sock full of coal if you don’t toe
the line. The really neat thing about this plan is that
the taxpayers get to provide the capital to finance the
whole operation. According to The Times, the govern-
ment envisioned the plan this way so that the telecom-
munications industry would not virulently oppose the
plan. Yet, just to keep telephone companies from
being bad citizens, there is a provision in the bill
which would fine telephone companies $10,000 a day
for every day they did not comply.

Now the FBI, the stalwart defender of truth, justice
and the American way, supports this plan. The reason
why is that they are finding it harder and harder to lis-
ten in on suspicious people who are using communi-
cations technology such as fiber optics. So, they sup-
port the current legislation as_ a way to protect every-

one from nefarious individuals who might wish to

endanger the average citizen. While they swear the
capability to monitor communications will only be
used in the public interest, the old maxim about
absolute power corrupting absolutely comes quickly to
mind. A

An unnamed White House official told The Times that
the law would be “a good compromise between priva-
cy and law enforcement needs.” Compromise denotes
that each side must give up a little of what it wants.

Compromise on an issue such as this is dangerous

because it is a slippery slope. Not only could these
technologies can be used by the government, but also
by computer hackers and telephone company insiders.
So not only can the government watch the people, but
the old communist and Orwellian principle of peoplt
turning in their comrades will also be a possibility.

Demagoguery has no place in education

Isn’t it fascinating that education is‘ such a two-
dimensional phenomenon? At the university
level, learning is first about that which we don’t
know, and second a separate component involv-
ing how that knowledge is acquired.

The hard-sciences are pretty cut and dry; there
isn’t much ﬂexibility in either what is learned or
how one learns it. Typically, a person with supe-
rior knowledge “lectures” those with little or no
familiarity of the material, thus educating the stu-
dent about, say, algebra. It’s a straight transfer
from the “haves” (teachers) to the “have-'nots”
(students). The politics or philosophies of the
“haves” have virtually no impact, since the learn-
ing consists of facts being transferred from one
party to the other. There is no intellectual nego-
tiation whatever between teacher and student:
the information, rigidly defined, is set.

The what-and-how model becomes a lot clear-
er when we speak of learning in the humanities.
When what is learned involves concepts that
escape the litmus test of “one plus one equals
two,” interpretation becomes a key »

cued, and I resent the implication that I am inca-
pable of handling my part of the learning trans-
action. .

It’s a free country, full of free speech, but the
thing that makes a demagogue different from
anyone who blathers on a street corner is when
their propaganda receives a respectable forum

(such as a newspaper). Then, the antithesis of

demagoguery —— responsibility — must be called
into play. Particularly when that newspaper is

. the voice of a major American university.

I, too, was in Bill Chase’s Soviet History class.
The Pitt News column referred to a “prominen,t
history professor...” Why? Because demagoguery
relies so heavily on innuendo. Saying “promi-
nent history professor” is bottom-line sleazy, like
repeating slanderous gossip with the preface “I
don’t want to mention any names, but  Tactic
number one: titillate by manufacturing an
alleged secret (like an unnamed name). The

V ‘writer dramatizes with a journalistic wink-and-a-

nod; the implication is that .the very souls of
those in the class were a

is more complicated than a straight
transfer. Intellectual ebb and flow

and the “have-nots”-. The very

nature of the subject matter lends
itself to debate and new interpretation. In this
way, how we learn becomes almost as important
as what we learn. An instructor who would sub-
vert this process in the name of their personal
ideology is unworthy of the title teacher.

Learning can even be negative-based, either in
content or fonn. Negative learning is the type of
learning in which the dominant lesson is: “I
don’t want to be that way.” Demagoguery is an
example of negative-based learning.
Demagoguery uses half-truths, emotionalism,
and intolerance as the primary method of per-
suasion to a particular agenda. Demagogues use
these tactics because of the inherent weakness
of their message and because they have so little
trust in the ability of others to decide what is
right. Demagoguery is not merely about a. differ-
ence of opinion, it is about tactics and methods.
It dominates the how-we-learn part of our
model. For that reason, demagoguery is danger-
ous and needs to be confronted.

A prime example of demagoguery was carried
by The Pitt News in a column titled “Teachers’
Views Aren’t Enlightened.” Presenting the topic
as another conservative/liberal point—counter-
point was a lame disguise.

Demagogues would have us believe that, par-
ticularly in the classroom, we are under some
sort of ideological attack. I don’t need to be res-

You [sigh] understand 
You bet I do. '

What I learned were the hows and whys of
communism in the Soviet state, including its
many failures. Dr. Chase constantly pointed to
fundamental flaws in the Soviet system; he asked
his students to consider what was done in Russia
in the context of the time in which it happened.
Hardly a mouthpiece for the left wing. And yes,
a joke or two was made at former President
Reagan’s expense. Demagogues just never light-
en up. If they did, they might be found out.
Hysterical manipulation requires a fever pitch
that is absent in humor.

The worst lie of the whole column concerned
this bit about “I love Lenin.” Writing the
Lenin/Lennon stuff on a particular page was a
security measure. Demagoguery has to use half-
truth, serial indignation, and fantastic connota-
tion to distract from the reality, particularly when
the reality is mundane.

Honest differences of opinion are a fab-
ulous part of educational negotiation. “Teachers’
Views Aren’t Enlightened” is not an example of
that. Demagoguery needs to be called for the
trash that it is. It doesn’t matter if one is conserv-
ative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, old or
young, in or out — demagogues threaten us all
with the very brainwash they claim to rally
against.

It’s back.

The Big East cup is back in
the Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team’s elaborate show-
case of trophies. The 1994 cup
will be sitting right next to the
1992 trophy because, for the
first time in a decade, the
Panthers lost the cup last year to
Villanova.

There was no doubt that the
swimmers and divers were
ready to compete last weekend
at Trees Pool. In a total team
effort, Pitt regained the champi-
onship in an impressive fashion,
winning by 75 points over the
closest ﬁnisher, Syracuse.

“This is very definitely an all-
around team,” head coach
Chuck Knoles said. “We are def-
initely a swimming and diving
team. We don’t just have swim-
ming and we don’t just have
diving, we have swimming and
diving and we’re very good at
both.”

The divers dominated the '

boards, as usual. They started
off the meet by giving the swim-
mers more than a 100-point lead
over the rest of the schools.
John Soulakis didn’t have any
first-year jitters as he placed sec-
ond on the three-meter board.

Sean Braud finished third with

Jeremy McClean in fifth.

On the one-meter board
Braud came in second, Soulakis
in third, McClean in fourth and
Steve Wolfe finished sixth.

“Sean dove very, very well,”
Knoles said. “We had lost him

For the Pitt News

The Pitt men's lacrosse
team opened its spring
season with force on
Sunday night at the Cost
Center. Their victim was
Frostburg State (Md.),
who quickly found out
why Pitt is the defending
National Collegiate
Lacrosse champions. The
Panthers jumped out to a
10-1 lead at halftime and
went on to win by the
score of 16-2.

Pitt opened the scoring
right away and Frostburg
quickly answered to tie it
at one. From that point on
Pitt just dominated, going
on a 15-1 run. The coach-
es even agreed to play the
second half with a “run-
ning clock,” which means
that the clock runs contin-
uously and is not stopped
for any reason. This is a

Strong swimming and diving brought the Big East men's title back to Pitt.

completely in the beginning of
the year for seven weeks. For
him to come back to take sec-
ond and third was incredible.”

Then it was up to the swim-
mers to take care of the unfin-
ished business. -

In first event, the ZOO-yard
freestyle relay, Zach Economos,
Eric Stull, David Williams and
Sami Vartiainen took second.

Williams had some personal
highlights as well. He won the
200-yard freestyle with an
NCAA-consideration time.
Williams finished second in the
100—yard freestyle and also
came in fourth in the 500—yard
freestyle.

“I'm not surprised,” David
Williams said of his first place
finish. “My times were right
around where I wanted them to
be.” I

Matt Brady provided some
more personal highlights as he
swam his way to an NCAA-con-
sideration time in the 400-yard
individual medley. He also fin-
ished second in the 200-yard
i.m. behind pool record-holder
Sabastian Goulet from Syracuse.

But when the awards were
handed out at the end of the
meet, it was all Miami. Diver
Chemi Gill won both boards as
he went on to win the the Most
Outstanding Diver Award. The

Most Outstanding Swimmer was
awarded to three—time pool
record-holder Tamas Deutsch.

Deutsch, a native of Hungary,’

broke his own pool record in
the 100-yard backstroke and
had an NCAA-consideration
time in the 100-yard butterﬂy.

“In September, I hope to be in
the world’ championships,”
Deutsch said. “I have been in
the top 10 since 1988, so it's
been a long time, and hopefully
I can win a medal.”

Not even the best swimmer
and diver could deny Pitt anoth-
er Big East Championship.

Villomoz/a ms up Pitt womens swim and dive

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

Halfway up the stairs on her
way to collect the Big East
meet’s outstanding swimmer
award, University of Miami
rookie Kristel Tellegen tripped.
Pitt Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes helped the embarrassed
Tellegen to her feet and then
handed her the award.

But there was nothing Jaynes
could do to help the Pitt
women’s swimming and diving
team. The women tripped and
stumbled all the way back to
fourth place at the Big East
championships this weekend at
Trees Pool.

Villanova led the culprits
involved in tripping up the
Panthers, winning the meet with
569 points. Miami was second
with 505 points, Syracuse fol-
lowed in third with 491 points
and Pitt fell into fourth, one
point behind the Orange.

“This was a really up-and-
down meet for us,” Pitt senior
captain Jen Burns said. “We
didn’t really finish as high as we
expected. The competition was
a lot different this year. There
was a lot of other teams that
stepped it up.”

The Pitt women expected a

tight meet, and what they got
was the short end of a slim 15-
point separation between sec—
ond and fourth.

“We had a great meet, it was
really exciting,” Pitt head coach
Marian Cassidy said. “We knew
it was going to be a tight meet.
We went for it, and I’m really

proud of the way the ladies
stood up and raced.”

One point separated
Villanova and Miami after
Saturday’s finals, but midway
through Sunday’s finals
Villanova separated itself from
the Hurricanes and was on its
way to a third consecutive Big

“They're really, really strong
even though they’re small,”
Burns said. “All of their girls are

Panther basketball needs math lesson

Seven in a row! Isn’t the
number seven supposed to be
lztc/ey?

In the case of the University
of Pittsburgh’s men’s basket-
ball team, the number seven is
anything but lucky.

_Pitt’s defeat at the paws of
the Connecticut Huskies on
Saturday night was its seventh
loss in a row. After the game,
Pitt head coach Paul Evans
commented on how close
most of the Panther losses
have been as of late.

“We just haven’t been doing
all the little things. As a result,
we lost some close games that
could have went either way,”
Evans said.

A positive note for the
Panthers amid Saturday night’s
loss was the ability to hold
Connecticut All-American
Donyell Marshall to 17_ points.

Unfortunately for the
Panthers, Donnie Marshall and
Brian Fair rose to the occasion
and picked up the slack for
Connecticut and a tightly-

guarded Donyell Marshall.

All the little things that
Coach Evans mentioned the
Panthers are not doing may be
true. Here is the problem.
When a team does not do the
“little things,” it adds up to
equal one big thing. In the
case of the Panthers, the sum
equals seven losses in a row.

play Seton Hall. The Panthers
then get a fresh slate when the
Big East Tournament com-
mences the following week.
This chalkboard cleaning con-
cerning the regular season
may be good news for the
Panthers.

But another problem arises.

ference is

The Panthers were able to

night’s game but were not able

contain the same mistakes that
were made in the past.
(Repeat again slowly if that
last sentence went over your
head.)

For the Panthers, fixing their
mistakes means going back to

math class and brushing up on
such things as adding, sub-
tracting, multiplying, dividing
and percentages:

-Improving their shooting
to add more points to their
score.

-Playing more tenacious
defense to subtract more

points from the opposition’s _

score.

-Playing more aggressively
on offensive and going to the
hoop, especially after halftime,
so the Panthers’ opponents’
fouls will mziltiply in the sec-
ond half. As of late, Pitt has
been playing the entire second
half without entering the
bonus.

-Playing better defense on
every opponent player by
dividing up the floor better
and not letting one or two
opponents burn the Panthers
from the outside.

Olmproving their free-throw
percentage. The Panthers are
not even averaging 70 percent

Temple
knocks off
men's gym

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

This past weekend the men’s
gymnastics team travelled to the
City of Brotherly Love to take
on Temple University and
Springfield (Mass) College.

The Owls turned out to be
ungracious hosts, beating the
Panthers 275.75 to 262.15.

Springfield finished third with

246.80 points.

Temple was led by the top
three all-around performers of
the day. Danny Akerman took
first place with a score of 56.50.
Dubie Bader (55.70) placed sec-
ond, and Dave Frank (55.30)
came in third.

Pitt was led by fourth-place
finisher Genaro Severino
(54.40) and fifth-place finisher
Chris Sweeten (52.15).

“The team did really well,”
sophomore Jason Lannie said.
“Everyone hittheir sets. With a
full healthy squad, we would
have given them a run for their
money.”

The best event of the day for
the Pitt squad was rings.
Severino led with a score of
9.55. This was good enough for
third place in the competition.

If the Panthers study hard and
improve their game, this season
does not have to be a wash.
After all, students have slipped
around midterms before, only
to put their noses to the grind-
stones and pull off a passing
grade for the term.

week of class with the Big East
Tournament being finals, this
term still may look promising.

We will see over the next two
weeks if the Panthers really hit
the books and make it into
graduate school (the NCAA or
NIT Tournament).

It will not be easy for Pitt to
qualify at this point for a post-
season tournament — probably
comparable to a student in a

cliampionsliip and last year
were preparation and focus.

"Last year we got caught
with our pants down,” Knoles
said. "This year that wasn’t
going to happen.”

"Our focus in the morning
'swinis was key,” sophomore
Bob Kupperman said. “Last
year we weren’t concentrating
enough in the morning and
th;1t‘s where you get people in

the night to score all the
points."

While the other schools
were winning the events, Pitt
consistently placed in the top
four ﬁnishers.

Brady, Bacharach,
Vartiainen and Williams fin-
ished second in the 500—yard
freestyle relay. Chris Perry
came in second by a blink in
the 200-yard breaststroke.

Economos placed third in

the 50-yard freestyle.

Although there was no
champagne being poured, the
emotions of regaining the title
were still wild.

“It felt pretty awesome,”
Bacharach said of 11 champi-
onships in 12 years. “It was
important for us to get it back,
especially for the seniors who
lost it last year. It was a great
opportunity for the freshmen
to be part of the class who

brought back the so-called
Stanley Cup of the Big East.”

‘‘It’s great,” said Kupperman.
“We owed it to the old school,
the alumni and mostly to our-
selves."

The celebration was capped
off with a couple of daring
dives by head diving coach
Julian Krug. Krug"s. finale was
a backtlip in which he landed
on the three-meter board and
then dove into the water.

similar idea to the 10-min nile in
baseball.

Head coach Gary Neft was
excited to get the season started
and said, “I thought that
Frostburg St. would be a little
bit better team. I think we
played well. We are definitely a
better team than they are, but
we tend to play sloppy against
teams that are not as good as us.
All in all, I am happy we got the
first game out of the way and
we can continue from there."

Last seasons leading scorer

Josh Gochnaur showed no neg-

ative signs of an ankle injury
that has prevented him from
practicing all year. Gochnaur
led the team’s offensive attack
with four goals and an assist,
and his linemate Ed Croot
chipped in a goal and a pair of
assists.

“Ed and I work well together,
and it was also good to see
things working out with the
newer guys because we haven‘t
played together that long, and if
everything stays well we should
win the NCLL again this year,"
Gochnaur said.

However, as well as every-
thing was going last night, the

team still suffered a setback.

They lost key contributor Eric
Kaveny for an indefinite period
of time. Kaveny injured his
shoulder and had to leave the
game, but not before leaving his
mark by scoring three goals.

“He’s probably going to be
out four to six weeks but will
hopefully be back for the Pitt
Tournament,” Gochnaur said.

The fourth annual Pittsburgh
Lacrosse. Tournament will be
held on April 8-10 at Pitt
Stadium and will include. vari-
ous teams from Virginia,
Maryland, upstate New York
and Penn State.

“I think that Thursday is going
to be the toughest game we
play until we come to the tour-
nament, and if we can win
lagainst the Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Clubl, then we can be undefeat-
ed going into the Pitt
Tournament,” Neft said.

“We have an advantage over
a lot of teams because of [the
Cost Center]. We can start so
much more earlier than anyone
else, and, heck, we've been
practicing since the second
week in January. However,
come spring break, we will lose
that advantage because we"ll
lose ten days of practice while
other teams who are not on
spring break yet will be able to
practice, since our break tends
to be ahead of everyone else’s.”

Neft, who with Sunday night’s
win unofficially raised his career
record to 71-19 (.789 percent) in
only five years, expects a lot out
of his team this season.

“I am very happy with the
Way we played, but obviously
there is a lot of room for
improvement,” he said.

The team’s next game is
tonight at 8 p.m. against
Washington and Jefferson at the
Cost Center and will be fol-
lowed by the big game against
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club on
Thursday night ~— same time,
same place.

didn’t think we’d be here with
our limited number of people. It
was a good team effort for hav-
ing only 15 women.”

Junior Meagan McCaffrey led
Villanova with her fourth and
fifth career Big East individual
titles, one in the 50-yard
freestyle and the other in the
100—meter freestyle. Her time in
the 50 free was a meet record
and qualified her for the
NCAAS, and her 100 free time
was good enough for NCAA
consideration.

Senior Lisa Flood won the
100-yard breaststroke for
Villanova in NCAA—considera-

tion time, and Wildcat sopho-
more Tammy Kouser won the
100-yard backstroke, also in
NCAA consideration time.
Villanova also won four of the
five relays, important because a
relay first is worth double the
points of an individual first.
Miami’s Tellegen won the
200-yard individual medley in
meet-record and NCAA—consid-
eration time, and she won the
200-yard breaststroke in NCAA-
consideration time. But, her
best swim came in the 400 i.m.
Her time of 4:18.08 broke a 15-
year pool record and the meet
record, and automatically quali-
fied her for NCAAs. She won

the race by 12 seconds over
second place.

“This is awesome,” Tellegen
said. “I never expected to win
any of my three events.
Everybody tells me that what I
did was incredibl.”

Pitt’s outstanding swimmer of
the meet was Burns. She had
the three highest finishes by Pitt
swimmers. She ﬁnished second
in both the 100- and 200-yard
freestyle and she came in third
in the 500-yard freestyle. Her
1:51.68 in the 200 free is an
NCAA—consideration time.

“Those are the highest places
I've ever had here and my three
highest times ever,” Burns said.

“I couldn’t be any happier.”
Other notable Pitt swimming
finishes include: junior Vicki
Geubtnefs seventh place finish
in the 50-yard freestyle; junior
Laura Zdyb’s fifth in the 1650-
yard freestyle and eighth in the
400 i.m.; junior Christy
Knobloch’s sixth in the 100-yard
butterfly, eighth in the 200
backstroke and eighth in the
200 fly; sophomore Alicia
Tymes’ eighth in the 100 free;
sophomore Jenny Doran’s fifth
in the 200 ﬂy; and rookie Charla
Caponi’s seventh in the 200 fly.
The only first for the Panthers
was sophomore Sunday
Lewandowski in the one-meter

, diving. She also finished second

in the three-meter. But
Lewandowski lost the outstand-
ing diver of the meet honors to
Miami’s Tiffany Sniegocki, who
finished first in the three-meter
and second in the one-meter.

“It came down to who beat
who by how many points,”
Lewandowski said. “She beat
me by more points in the three-
meter than I beat her by in the
one-meter. ”

“I was really happy with what
I did on the one-meter,”
Lewandowski said. “One—meter
is not what I like to do. I love
three-meter, but I ‘didn’t have a
very good meet on it.”
