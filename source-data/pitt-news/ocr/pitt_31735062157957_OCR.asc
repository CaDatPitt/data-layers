man who lives athome, has some
part-time work, and who still
wants totake his place in Pitt’s
many activities.
, Dr. Swarts said that most stu-
dents need advice in making
‘ the change from high school to’
university life, or from mili-
tary training experiences to ac-
ad em i c experiences. “Men’s
Council,” he said, “has developed
a first semester’s program which
shows the beginning student'the
, way to academic and extra-
curricular success.” '
Details of the Conference pro-
,gram revealed that groups p are
limitedto 25 in number. The ‘lec-
ture method of instruction has
been replaced entirely by discus-

sion and’ demonstration. Men’s

Traditions Fall as Homecoming

Weekend Gets FloatParade

Student Congress held its ﬁrst meeting of the semester
‘on Monday with the result that many‘ time honored events

in the school year have either

been eliminated or changed.

Under their new president, Emil Herman, the congress-
men Went to workaltering tradition. Firstto fall under the ax
was the annual Float Parade held asone of the highlights to

Spring Festival. This year it will
be held as a part of the Home-
coming celebration for the North-
western game on Saturday, Oct.
23. A »
P ‘Robert Timmons, SC athletic
committee chairman, announced
that Dad’s. Day was “too much” in
as much ‘that this year there will
be an “assortment of Days”, mean-
ing Twirler’s Day, Band Day, High
School Day, and others.

He, said that not enough inter-

=e’s"‘t had been given Dad’s Day in

_ the past and except for the fathers
it of the football players not many

participated in the program. How-
ever the Athletic Department in-
tends to invite the fathers of the
players to one of theehome games
and, as in the past, will have
them ‘sit behind the team on the
ﬁeld, ‘Timmons said.

This year the Student Congress
sponsored trip ."for an_ “away”
football“ game will be_ for the Ohio
State University contest. But ‘this

 

year only a bus ticket will be part
of the “package deal” which in
the past included a ticket to the
football game plus transportation,
according to Stanley Greenﬁeld,
who is in charge of this project
for SC. The bus ticket to O.S.U.
will cost $4.95 and if the student

game they are avilable at the
Athletic Department or at O.S.U.,
he said.

Greenﬁeld also gave his report
on the Oakland parking situation,
an assignment he had from Con-
gress last semester and carried
throughsthe summer. In reply to
his letter to Michael, J. Gittens,
trafﬁc engineer for the city of
Pittsburgh, requesting that the
parking situation-in the Schenley
Plaa be improved, Greenﬁeld an-
nounced that Mr. Gittens had
promised “improvement of the

aisles and elimination of aisle
parking.” ' ,

 

wishes to buy a ticket to that"

 

Council provides, visual aids of all
types, as well as a syllabus of the
course for each student.

To accomodate all men en-
rolled, the conferences are held
during eight periods for ﬁvedays
of the week. Each group is ad-
ministered by two Senior Coun-

selors and a faculty member.

E & M Schools to Face

Business and Industry Leaders
Plan Long Range Development
Program for Engineering School

by JIM DeWEESE

Thirty top leaders in business and industry gathered
at the University Club on Monday, Sept. 20, for the purpose
of organizing the Engineering and Mines Advisory Council
of the University of Pittsburgh. Their aim: A long range
development program, effective immediately.

Plans were drawn up at this meeting dictating a com- ”

plete overhaul of the engineering¢

school. The Council plans to in-
stall additional equipment, courses
and instructors. Already, new lab-
oratory supplies have been do-

nated to the schools by interested

corporations.

Eight groups, comprised of two
alumni and one graduate of a
school other than Pitt; form the
nucleus of the Council. ~ Each
member realizes what industry
requires of a graduating engi-
neer. These requirements ,Will
eventually become an integral part
of the program. ,

This Council idea is not an ex-
periment. It has been used with
great success. at Queens. Univer-
sity in A Ontario, -Canada. Courses
_Were revamped, lab equipment
provided, scholarships and fellow-
ships were given to students and
members of the faculty. - 1

With Pitt current undergoing
the widest expansion program in
its history, the advent of the Ad-
visory Council was well timed.

Although the new engineering,
building will be occupied next
Spring, plans for further building
have already commenced. Steps
are now being taken- to ‘provide
endowments, loans, gifts, and
equipment for these new build-
mgs.

Men’s Council has made ar- «
rangements to show the mov-
ies of the Pitt-Southern Cali-
fornia football game on
Thursday, Sept. 30, in Stephen
Foster Memorial from 10:30
to 11:30 a.m. and from 1:30 to
2:30 p.m. No admission will
be charged. G

They have also arranged to
have a television set in room
817 C1 throughout the course

‘ of the World Series games. P
All students are _invited to
view these games.

Student Leaders
Advise Freshmen

“Aim for the Top”

“Aim for the Top,” the theme
for the class of 1958, was im-
pressed upon 140 freshmen as they
gathered at Camp Kon-‘O-Kwee
last week end for Pitt’s 24th an-
nual freshman camp.

‘Students from the college, the
school of engineering and mines,
business administration, and the
pre-med school heard talks by Dr.
James Liu, head of the Far East
dept.; Thomas Rutter, S 'Awardee
just back from Europe; and Frank
Blackstone, ODK man of the year
for 1949. All of these men stressed
the importance of establishing a
high goal in life and the equally
important part that a college edu-
cation plays in the attainment of

that goal.

Chancellor Fitzgerald arrived at
camp Friday evening and address-
ed an assembly Saturday morning
on the importance of the task be-
fore them. According to Student
Chairman Bud Hodgins, this is the
ﬁrst time that any of Pitt’s chan-
cellors have appeared at freshmen
camp.

The immediate aim of the camp
committee was to ‘see ' that the
freshmenwhad a good tifne. This
was assured when a four-way ri-

-valry developed between the en-

gineers, the bus ads, the pre meds,
andmthe college students. The point
of this rivalry was the camp tro-
phy which was awarded on the

basis of points ‘earned in athletics,
skits, and speeches. The Engineers

Little Man On Campus .. by Bibler

IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE ‘coueocf
To PUT A ‘POLISH’ ON_A
YOUNCI MAN—-YOU'LL see A
REAL CHANGE WHEN HE COME
Home FOR CHRISTMAS VACATION.

Wltere You A t?

The unduly overdue and sorely needed" men’s orienta-
tion program at Pitt became a reality last, week as the
University enjoyed what may well be the largest registra-
tion invthe past ﬁve years.

The title, “streetcar college,” hasbeen ingloriously sy-
nonymous with Pitt for many years and has evolved a type ‘
of organism commonly referred to. as “the commuter’s
commuter.” These students maintain an unchangable sched-
ule which consists mainly of coming to,school for their ﬁrst
class and leaving immediately after their last class.

Granted that an education is the primary aim of a uni-
versity but the word itself contains more connotations than

, letters. The commuterwho looks at Pitt as a collection of

class rooms is, to be sure, gazing at the main pointof a

college education but, in so (doing, is overlooking all the

other aspects which are not covered by his tuition. It is
these aspects which the new_ orientation program has as
its focal point. ’ ‘

Still, Pitt is a University and as such must offer stu-
dents an education. The program not only strives to get

the student rolling but to accelerate his movements’ by
pointing out some of the most common stumbling blocks
and the ways and means of surmounting them.

The average freshman is not as “green” as many upper-
classmen would’ have us believe. Many of the new students .
have a plan of study designed to lead them into a prede-
termined ﬁeld. The fact that they have registered at Pitt
indicates a well grounded desire for further education and
the orientation. program has been evolved with this in
mind.‘ It is not designed to carry the- student into the dust
covered archives, there to memorize customs and tradi-
tions. Neither is it set up to show them how to drink tea

or say good morning to third assistant deans.

The program has been organized to cover the entire
ﬁrst semester. Pitt’s men student leaders have joined "the
stafﬁ, of the dean’s’ofﬁce in applying a considerable period
of time each week to the plan in the realization that,
valuable though their time may seem to them, its applica-
tion in the ﬁeld of freshmen orientation will lay the ground
work for a cohesion between the students themselves
which will ultimately result in the type of students that
a university: strives to produce, and a university of which
the students can be proud. . .

Janice Comes to   Pitt  

(Editor’s note: Late in August the editors of
the PITT NEWS -began to ﬁnd typed notes on

their desks. Crude and badly written at ﬁrst, the '

notes improved until the lack of capital letters and
the omission of any punctuation involving the
shift key were the only changes from regular writ-
ing. On September 21 the following note was found
in the editor’s typewriter, written in lower case
as usual.

say, who. is boss around here
doesnt’ anybody read these notes
1'. need to talk to somebody

The eclito'r’s reply to this note requested com-..

plete information about the writer. On Monday

morning the following lines were found on a sheet

of newsprint.)

dear mister james deweese

you want me to introduce myself

all right i will and i will give you a picture
it was taken last summer at kittywood park
those photo machines never ﬂatter a girl

but this will give you the idea

my name is janice and iam a_ freshman at pitt
it took some doing to get into this university
but i come ‘from a superior family
and my upbringing was impeccable
inspite of my neighbors A

the heridity and environment boys
will have trouble

when all the facts about me are in ,

ll

you see, mister deweese, .

i come from a distinguished literary family

my great, ever-so-greatgrandmother was famous
her name was mehitabel and she lived in new york
she had a literary agent named archy ‘

he claimed he made her famous‘

but grandma said he didn’t do much

all he did was what any good ‘agent would do

he got her immortal lyrics

and her philosophic pieces published _
not only in a newspaper but also in a book
in the end he committed insecticide

i dont think a girls environment

should count against her

how can i help it that my mother

happened to be living in homestead last year
our family is a matriarchy it

by custom and by preference t ,

i never saw father but mother‘ used to tell us
quote-now therewas a guy

he was night inspector at the seamless tube
and when he arched’ his back

steel gray and black wavelets flowed and ripple
spinelength from ears to tail '
and could he sing -'

it was really his voice that attracted me ﬁrst
little ones, your dear old tabby

was just too handsome unquote

you can see that heredity and environment

get all mixed up.

mister deweese, -
it is the accidentsof life that count
i am not what i seem

and it is because of an accident a

a door was left open by mistake

one night i went shopping for breakfast
at the back door of the high school cafeteria
tuna ﬁsh salad was their specialty

Squares at a premium

 

the door was open

i went in and what a ﬁne place it was
especially the library where i decided to live
thats how i got into homestead high school

\

how i got to pitt is a secret

for ‘awhile at least, mister deweese

yes, i had credits

and i had an interview with a lady

who asked me a lot of questions .
but only one or two about being ascholar
well, mister dewees, i will confess one} thing
i want— to be a phi beta kappa

, .

,whenv grandmother mehitabel‘ died she‘ said ,

so, it came to pitt

quote always remember platoi

he said it all in a metaphor about a cave
unquote , _'

i said i came from a remarkable family
anyway for twenty-eight generations

since mehitabel we all heard

quote, remember the cave unquote"

so i had‘ to get into homestead high school
lsibrarylto ﬁnd out what it was

a

and the lady never said a word about the cave
she asked -me what i wanted to study P

i told her history- and geology we

quote why question mark unquote she asked

i “had my answer ready, mister gdeweese‘
in that homestead library i read everything

i said to her quote those two subjects

are areal antidote for all this

montistic totemism amonghuman beings
and besides i wantito study geology ‘ ,

in order to understand biology because eventually a

the voyage of. the beagle will be considered
more important than the skullduggery
in the garden of eden unquote

mister deweese, you can see

that i have no ulterior motive

in coming to pitt 
i just want "to know ,what there is to know
and no foolishness

quote well unquote said the lady

quote i can see A‘
that you are a very sophisticated young woman
but we will admit you on probation‘ '
and change all that unquote

you can see, mister deweese’
that i got admitted all right

Rutter SeesEurope

“S” Awardee Thumbs Through
IF Sponsored Goodwill Tour

Pitt student Tom Rutter never
realized how small the world
really was until last summer. As
winner of the new “S” Award
sponsored by Pitt’s interfraternity
Council, Tom had all of Europe
laid before him with the good old
American methodgof thumbing to
see it.

For six. weeks Tom attended
Oxford University Summer School
and spent,the.,weekends touring
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.
“Their system of education is
definitely more difficult,” he said.
His course on “Politics and Litera-
ture in the 20th Century” includ-
ed, lectures and tutorials by many
outstanding Britons such as Eliza-
beth Bowen and Stephen Spend-
sei-. A

England was similar to Western
Pennsylvania, and Wales greatly
resembled Scotland. But the Euro__-
pean country which Tom consid-
ered to be the cleanest was the
Netherlands. At the termination of

his ‘course at Oxford he sailed for

that country and spent some time
in ~Amsterda_m and the Hague.
“That’s ‘where the food was emost
abundant, but of course, the food
in Paris was the best,” Tom re-
lated. _ »

The senior pre—law student was

on‘ his own on the continent as he
made his way from country to

country. He found no trouble in
meeting the people because they
were “just like us.” There was
hardly any language barrier be-
cause most of the people in busi-
nesses could speak some English.
“I think our greatest fault in the
United States is notgappreciating
other languages. Foreign lan-
guages should be taught in the
elementary grades.” '

The “biggest eye—opener” Tom
saw was the reconstruction in
Germany. Frankfurt was astound-
ingly modern and built up, ac-
cording to the tourist. The re-
construction seemed practically
complete to him. From Heidel-
berg, 'Germany, Tom__ went to
scenic Switzerland to get a first-
hand view of the Alps.

Tom received the blessings of
Pope ’ Pius. XII and enjoyed his
first opera, “Rigolett'o,” in Italy,
and was also impressed by the
performance of Shakespeare’s

“Taming-of the Shrew” at Strat-

ford-on-Avon andv“Mona Lisa” at
the Louvre in Paris.
Rome was the most “magnifi-

cent” and interesting city and the

site of the best entertainment, ac-
cording to Tom. Once on the Ap-
pian Way he had an Italian who
couldn’t speak English explaining
the scenery to him, in French.
Luckily Tom. understood French!

AND PROMPTLY PUT IT IN MY TYPEWRITER

First of a1l—how come? _ _ _ _

How do I come to be writing a column for Philip Morris in your
campus newspaper? I

I’ll tell you how come: _

It all began on a summer night. The air was warm, the sky was
full of stars, and I sat in a cane-bottomed chair on my verandah,
peaceful and serene, smoking a. cigarette, humming the largo from
Death and Transﬁguration, and worming my dog. _

Into this idyllic scene came a stranger —- a tall, clean limbed

stranger, crinkly-eyed and crooked-grinned, loose and lank. “How

Q1

do you do,” he said. “My name is Loose Lank and I am with the
Philip Morris people.” ‘ ‘

“Enchanted,” I said. “Take off your homburg and sit down.” I .

clapped my hands. “Charles !” I called. “Another chair for Mr. Lank.”
Obediently my dog trotted away and returned directly with a
fan-back chair of Malayan rattan; He is the smartest dog in our block.
“I’m sorry I don’t have a Morris chair,” I said to_ Mr. Lank. “That
wo(1iildnb’e rather more appropriate‘— you being with Philip Morris
an a . .
Well, sir, we had many a laugh and cheer over my little witticism.
When we had ﬁnished laughing and cheering, we wiped our eyes and
Mr. Lank pulled out a fresh package of Philip Morris. He yanked.
the tape and the "pack sprang open with a fetching little snap.
“Did you hear that fetching little snap?” asked Mr. Lank.
“Yes,” I said, for I did.
“Cigarette?” he said.
“Thank you,” I said.

“re puffed contentedly for three or four hours. Then Mr. Lank
said, “I suppose you’re wondering why I’m here.”

“Well,” I replied, my old eyes twinkling, “I’ll wager you didn’t
come to read my meter.” . .

You can imagine how we howled at that one!

\ ‘‘That’s a doozy!’_’ cried Mr. Lank, giggling wildly. “I must re-
member to tell it to Alice when I get home.” ~

“Your wife?” I said.
“My father,” he said.
“Oh,” I said.

“Well,” he said, “let’s get down to business . ., . How would you like I

to write a campus column for Philip Morris?”

“For money?” I said.

“Yes,” he said. I

“My hand, sir,” I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned the
pressure, and soft smiles played on our lips, and our eyes were brighter
with tlige hint of tears, and we were silent, not trusting ourselves
to s ea . .

“ igarette?”‘he said at length.

I nodded. "

We lit up and puffed contentedly for eight or ten hours. “I under-
stand you’ve made quite a study of college students,” said Mr. Lank.

“Yes,” I said, blushing modestly. “I have been collecting them for
years. I have over four thousand students in my basement right now.”

“In mint condition?” he said incredulously.

“Students don’t come in mint condition,” I explained. “They go to
great expense to acquire the ‘beat-up look.’ ”.

“How interesting,” he said. “Tell me something more about them-
their feeding habits, for example.”

“They are omnivores of prodigious appetite,” I said. “It is wise
not to leave food about when they are present. Their favorite food
is a dish called the Varsity Gasser—one scoop raspberry ice, one
scoop raw hamburger, leechee nuts and maple syrup.” V

“Fascinating,” said Mr. Lank. “And what are studentsiritorcstedi
in chieﬂy?”

“Each other,” I replied. “Boy students are interested in girl
students, and girl students are interested in boy students.”

“This seems to mean admirable arrangement,” said Mr. Lank.
“But is it true even in these parlous days of worldwide tension and
dreadful armaments?” " .

“It is always true,” I said. “It isn’t that college students don’t
know what’s going on in the world. They know all too well. They're
perfectly aware of the number of lumps waiting for them . . . But

meanwhile the limbs are springy and the juices run strong and .

time is ﬂeeting.”

“What will you write about in your column?” asked Mr. Lank.

“About boys and girls,” I said. “About fraternities and sororities
and dormitories and boarding houses and dances and sleighrides
and hayrides and cutting classes and going to classes and cramming
for exams and campus politics and the proﬁts of bookstores and con-
vertibles and BMOCS and BWOCS and professors who write new
texts every year and the world's slowest humans —the page boys
at the library.” .

“And will you say a pleasant word about Philip Morris from time
to time?” asked Mr. Lank.

“Sir,” I replied, “I can think of no other kind of word to say about
Philip Morris.” , A

We shook hands again then, and smiled bravely. Then he was gone
-a tall silhouette moving erectly into the setting sun. “Farewell,
good itobacconist.!” I cried after him. “Aloha, aloha!”

Never-beaten Gophers

Play in Stadium Opener

By GENE AROMATORIO

Shaking off the effects of a disappointing 27-7 defeat at
the hands of Southern California, Red Dawson’s football
huskies are busy prepping for Saturdays clash with the Min-

nesota Gophers at Pitt‘ Stadium.

If the law of averages determined the outcome of foot- '3
ball games, the Panthers would be a shoo-in—-they have
never beaten the Golden Gophers. In‘ last year’s meeting

with the Gophers, the Panthers came out on the short end

Despite Heavy Losses
RunneIts0ff Winging

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

. Although Coacli Carl Oldson lost ﬁve runners out of
his starting squad from last years undefeated Pitt harriers,
local track fans can expect another top-ﬂight team to repre-
sent Skyscraper U. this season. '
‘Last Saturday’s meet found the Olsonmen getting OH
on the right foot by shutting out Slippery Rock 15-50 with
the ﬁrst ﬁve men breaking the tape in 23:34. The Panthers

now have a ten -game victory

of a 3514 score.

Pacing the Minnostians to vic-
tory last year was All—American
left half back Paul Giel. This
year, with Giel out of the picture,
a couple of brother halfbacks, Bob

‘and Dick McNamara, will spear-

head the visitors’ Split-T offense.
Big brother Bob is a 186 lb. senior
and team captain while Dick is a
160 lb. soph who diE1n’t earn a
letter last year..

Right now, a major headache
of the Pitt coaching taff is in-
juries. A fractured left hand, his
passing hand, has sidelined soph
quarterback Darrell Lewis for at
least ten days, meaning he deﬁn-
itely ’ wil not see action against
Minnesota. With starting quarter-
back Rudy, Mattio1i’s knee still
tender from’ a recent operation,

-the Panthers are walking on thin

ice as far as the signal-calling
position is concerned.

Another, injury occured at
Monday afternoon’s practice -ses-
sion when .end Dick Scherer dis-
located his shoulder for the sec-
ond time this year. However,
Scherer, who got his shoulder ﬁx-
ed just in time for the Southern
Cal game where he caught a
touchdown pass, is expected to be
ready by Saturday.

A big question mark also looms
in the person of fullback Tom
Jenkins who sprained an ankle in
the fourth quarter of the South-

» ern Cal game. Jenkins played a

brilliant game on both oﬁense and

defense and his removal in the,

ﬁnal quarter marked the turn-
ing point of the game.

In addition to gaining‘ 54 in 12
attempts, Jenkins played a ﬁne
defensive. Although the soph full-
back was limping badly at Mon-

For after the results were ﬁn-

“Sure” ‘he commented, “the

Penn State.

T h ‘e e x a c t
answer is pres-
ently unknown,
but the spirit and enthusiasm that
the boys have shown in the prac-
tice sessions leaves room for op-
timism.

Coach Olson explained that the
squad has no name stars with
fantastic high school reputations
as many other schools do, but the
boys are all “hungry."

“Being hungry-” Olson said, “is
one quality that goes in the mak-

they ar-e not out for the glory as
many athletes from other schools
are. Instead, they are out to pro-
duce a winning team.”
Something else that is recog-
iniable in the 1954 edition of the
Olsonmen is their teamspirit and
great leadership. Olson said, “I
have great leaders in Captain
Alan Gunderson and Bob Cherry,
but I don’t think we can win them
all. The schedule is too tough.”

But just watching the veterans
Gunderson, Cherry, Dave Freas,
and Chick Wivell along with
promising newcomers Arnie So-
we1l,_ Jim Moore, Tom Jessup,
Wendell Harford, and Jack Shu-
bert run the ﬁve-mile course ev-
ery day shows that the feeling
that Coach Olson’s boys will re-
ward him with another undefeat-
ed season is possible.

Bemis already boasts a prom-

Here and There
..In Southern Cal.

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

Observations of a trip: ,
Jess Hill wasn’t a hard man to talk to after last Friday

.night’s game. He stood around munching an apple in the

dressing room and ﬂipped answers back to reporters just
as fast as they shot them out.

He gave the usual comments about how strong Pitt was

even though they lost, but he added something which most
coaches don’t include in their post—game interviews.

“You know,” he said, .“we weren’t that much better than
Pitt. Why, in that last quarter, we played the best ball I’ve
seen at Southern Cal in my -four seasons here.”

His following remarks also showed a great respect for
the eastern eleven. Concerning the Panther offense, Hill
said, that “We didn’t know what kind of offense to expect
from Pitt and we practiced a defense for every type of offense
possible, single wing, double wing, T, Split M ,

T, everything.”

As-to the play thatthis sensational half-
back Jon Arnett was breaking through on, _«
the SC mentor pointed. out that “it was al-
most the very same play that you were burn-
ing us on in the ﬁrst half. We used Arnett 
on that straight off-tackle play that Pitt full- ‘
back Tom Jenkins was gaining on. .

However, the coach was quick to add ,
that the “passing opened it up ,and then the
running attack won it for us.”

When asked about the theory of sub- Hm

stituting complete teams at the end of the ﬁrst and third

quarters which Head Coach Red Dawson does, Hills tried
to-evade the question but eventually conceded that he doesn’t
believe in vthistsystem but saw its advantages. ,

This controversy arose since Dawson put in a new team
at the start of the second period just as Southern Cal reached
deep into Panther territory. As the situation turned out,
SC completed the drive -against the new men for their ini-
tial score. _,

Hill’s explanation was that “I’m just not a man to sub-
stituted ‘teams but there are plenty of coaches who believe
in this.” ‘

‘ * * *

_ Another short, but to the point comment on the con-
test, was by Ray Scott, veteran sportscaster who broadcast
the tilt back home. “Pitt was always one play away,” was
his reply and this seemed especially true in the ﬁrst half
when opportunities cropped up but the Panthers just couldn’t
go all the way. 4

To ‘this observer, the mistakes down on the ﬁeld were
obvious and while excuses aren’t supposed to beimade, the
inexperience that Dawson stressed was clearly seen.

C The sophomores showed inexperience not so much in
the ﬁnesse of their play, but in their overeagerness to make
good. Just that slight edging forward the second before the
ball was snapped, threw a ofﬁside penalty ﬂag down quite

a few times. ~

~ To say that this will be worked on in practice this week,
is an understatement.

And, a good note to close on-—it was quite a few times
that the SC cheerleaders asked their student section to make‘
more noise because a Pitt section of about 200 alumni and
friends on the other side were drowning out the SC cheers!!!

Begin Practice

_Pitt’s 1954 freshmen foot-
ball team began spring drills
yesterday and approximately
40 candidates reported to
Head Coach Steve Petro.

This year’s squad will run
from both the singlewing and
T formation with the unbalanc-
ed line. The Panther varsity squad
also uses both formations.

Several h i g h 1 y - touted high
school football players are count-
ed heavily upon by Petro to form
the nucleus of this year’s eleven.
Among them is Jimmy Theodore,
a sensational breakaway runner
who starred at Wilmerding High
and recently in the .1 .C. All—Star
game.

Other touted performers in-
clude John Guzik of Cecil, Dick
Bowen of Duquesne, and Bill Wa-
linchus from Monoy City, Pa.,In-
cidentally, Bill’s father was an
All—Am-erican performer at Pitt in
the early 1930’s.

The Panther’s intend to mix up
their runnin-g and passing game
effectively so as to keep the op-
position off-balance.

The freshmen have a- tough
four—gam~e schedule this autumn
and will be hard—pressed to win
them all.

The schedule features two home
»battles—-one opposite Penn State
and the other against Kent State.
They are thee opening two con
tests. . '

The schedule:

‘Oct. 23 . . . . . Penn State (Home)
Oct. 29 . . . . . Kent State (Home
Nov. 5  Navy (Away)

Nov. 19 . . . . . . . West Va. (Away)

Officer Visits Pitt

Maj. Gen. George W. Smythe,
Second Army Deputy Commander,
will visit the Pitt ROTC unit on
Sept, 30.“‘He plans to visit classes
and help in solving any problems
that might exist.

Service records of ROTC grad‘
uates are among the highest of the
Army’s officer corps. Much of this
accomplishment stems from the
intensive studies in imlitary
science offered by the ROTC PTO‘
gram and the general knowledge
gained by the student in college
studies.
