Rules USC

Violations

by DON MARBURY
News Editor

The Student Government
election question was thought
to be over, finally and decided-

 ly last Wednesday with the win

of Steve Cundra and his United
Student Coalition (USCt party
over the first election victors
Harris Miller and his Student
Community Union (SCU) par-
ty. But is it‘?

After two elections, two
very close victories, a com-
plete reversal of SG senatorial
wins, appeals, two SGElection
Board precedents, heated de-

;_ bate, many irregularities, and

basic confusion, the Student
Government 1970 elections are
still under question and in a
state of unstability.

Last Wednesday night. amost
immediately following the news
that Steve Cundra had wonthe sec-
ond SG election. supporters of
Harris Miller appealed the elec-

‘ tion to the .Elections Board. say-

ing that Cundra had violated a
section of the Elections Code
which prohibited any type of cam-

paigning on election day.

The Elections Board met for
nearly eight hours last Thursday
to consider the appeal from Mill-
er’s supporters and ruled that
Cundra had indeed violated the
Elections Code and that this cou-
pled with a first election censure,
for overspending in campaigning
and an unclear relationship with
the Committee for Effective Stu-
dent Government, was enough to
constitute his disqualification.

So Cundra and his vice presi-
dential candidate Lee Clabots
were officially disqualified but
many of his elected senators were
only censured or reprimanded by

i the Board. along with some of

.\lillei"s elected officials. from

the second election also.

Logically and according to the
Election Board. Student Govern-
ment should consist of Harris
Miller and Shep Goldberg at the
helm with 16 of Cundraﬂs sena-
tors and nine from their own par-
ty.

But . . . . following the news that
Cundra had been disqualified, his
supporters filed an appeal with
Assistant Chancellor for Com-
munity Affairs Bernard Kobosky

S  who will refer the appeal to the

proper University organization

for review.

’   SG Elections Unresolved To Date,

Election Board

Committee Disqualifies Cundra; Censures Senators

(Editor's Note: Exerpts from a
complaint lodgedpgainst the Elec-
tions Committee's findings will ap-
pear in Wednesday's Pitt News.)

We the Student Government
Elections Committee hereby dis-
qualify Steven Cundra and Lee
Clabots. President and V'ice-Pres-
ident elect respectively of Student
Government of the United Student
Coalition on the basis of two «Z»
actions in serious violation of the
election code.

These violations were for:

1. irregularities in election
expenditures consisting of:

at First. theunclear status of
the party‘s relationship with the
Committee for Effective Student
Government.

bi Second. an approximate $40-

excess of the $200 limit for cam-
paign expenditures.

2. Violations of'Section 3 of the
amended code appearing in the
Pitt News February 2. 1970. Page
1. "Campaigning will be limited
to personal contact. No persons or
groups may distribute printed ina-
terial on behalf of any party or
individual candidate. No addition-
al funds may be spent by anyone
on behalf of any party or individ-
ual candidate."

In this regard. the candidates.
as leaders of their party. failed
to comply with the requests of the
Elections Committee to remove
signs and stickers which to our
minds constituted campaigning
during the period between the
first invalidated election and the
second election which was held
February 4. 1970.

The candidates and the chair-
man of the party of United Student
Coalition‘ failed to comply with di-
rect requests on the part of the
Student Government Elections
Committee to remove the afore-
mentioned signs and stickers af-
ter having indicated their willing-
ness and intention to do so.

After hearing evidence from
both parties and alter a great deal
of deliberation. the -Committee
found that independently neither
censure was sufficient to merit
disqualification. however. when
taken in combination. the Com-

«This statement was reprinted
in whole from an explanation and
bibliography put out by the Coor-
dinating Committee for the School
Lunch Program, c 0 Graduate
School of Social Work. Lhiversity
of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh. Pa.

The February initiatives of the
.\loratorium. the national peace
movementhas taken a new look
in Pittsburgh. This month. the Mo-
ratorium is designed to tie a link
between major social issues and
the peace effort. The particular
link in Pittsburgh is to be a school
lunch program. in the Pittsburgh
Public Schools. coordinated by the
Pittsburgh Peace Coalition. and
the Welfare Rights Organization
of Allegheny County iWROAC l.

According to a Pittsburgh
Peace Coalition spokesman. the
efforts this month are designed to
show that peace is more than "not
war." The rationale behind this
move is to show that with peace.
not only the cessation of hostile
military acts. but also an increas-
ed participation in welfare and so-
cial issues are to be expected_of
our government.

It was explained to the Pitt
News that if the war in Vietnam is
ended, that the 35 billion dollar
war budget will probably be turn-
ed. over to the Defense Depart-
ment for research, rather than be-
ing rechanneled into the main-
stream of domestic aid. “The end
of the war,” the spokesman claim-
ed, “won’t end hunger.”

The school lunch program will
be a form of constructive protest.
and it is hoped by the planners to
be more effective'than a mass
demonstration of feeling. such as
the November March on Washing-
ton. Rather than a protest against
the unfair and unjust involvement
of our government in the Asian
war. "the lunch program is pro-
testing the type of thinking that
causes the war. that leads us into
the war. and that refuses to deal
with social problems. but subsi-
dizes industry. and farmers who

don‘t grow anything. while people i’
in this country go hungry.“

Concerning the school lunch pro-

gram. it was stated that currently , A

the Board of Education is institut-
ing school lunch programs in nine
schools. The Peace Coalition has
received money to fund such a-
program in one other school. but
is attempting to obtain funds for
34 elementary schools. considered
to be poverty area schools. I

The way the program will work,
as explained to the Pitt News, is
that during the weekaof Feb. 15 to
22, booths will be placed in the.
Towers, the Student Union, and

the Cathedral. Students, faculty, ,

and other interested people will be
asked to donate one'week’s lunch
money, and go without lunch for
that week. “We would like people
to feel for one week, what many

children feel every day, hunger,” .

stated Bob Morgart, an executive
member of the Peace Coalition.

Saga food will also permit dorm

students to signover their meal A

ticket number for lunch during
this week’. so that it maybe used
for the lunchprogram.

One other planned activity spon-
sored by the peace groups will be
the presentation of Cao Ngoch
Phoung. a noted peace activist and
Buddhist exile from Vietnam. He
will speak at the University and
City Ministries on Feb’. 22 at 2
p.m. Although the presentation is
free. it is planned as a fund rais-
ing activity.

 

A mass student meeting will
be held on Tuesday at noon in
the Commons Room to discuss
the present University finan-

cial crisis.

Due to the late arrival of the
Rascals, who presented the
Weekend's final concert on Sun-
day, the audience waited for
nearly two hours with little to
divert them besides their pro-
grams and fertile imaginations.

   

 '  Saturday night, fraternities, sor-
orities and campus organiza-
tions manned booths at the
Weekend's Carnival. Among the
activities were a slave auction,
wheel of chance, benefit booth
for muscular dystrophy, and
varied booths of chance.

- first concert on Friday evening

sented a narrow band in the
wide spectrum of rock, alienat-
ing a portion of the audience.

In a statement issued Friday morn-

‘ ing, the Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC) disqualified Steve
Cundra and Lee Clabots, president and
vice-president elect, respectively, of

~ Student Government on the basis of

"two actions “in serious violation of the
election code.” 

g The first action “in serious viola-
tion of the election code,” the,approxi-
mate $40 excess of the $200 limit for
campaign expenditures and the unclear
status of the United Student Coalition
.Party’s relationship withthe Commit-
tee for Effective Student Government,
merited nothing more than censure-

ship in The Pitt News after the first
Student Government election was de-
clared invalid. ’

The second action involved viola-
tions of Section 3 of the amended elec-
tions code appearing in The Pitt News
February 2, 1970: “Campaigning will
be limited to personal contact. No per-
sons or groups may distribute printed
material on behalf of any party or in-
dividual candidate. No additional funds
may be spent by anyone on behalf of
any party or individual candidate.” The
candidates, as leaders of their party,
failed to comply with the requests of
the Elections Committee to remove
signs and stickers which constituted
campaigning during the period be-

tween the first invalidated election and
the second election.

If the first action in violation of the
elections code was merely censured in
The Pitt News, then chances are that
the second action would have resulted
in censureship had the $40 excess ex-
penditures not taken place. It seems
clear, that one censureship plus one
censureship equals disqualification.

This simple mathematical formu-
la has undesirable consequences. Can
future Student Government Presiden-
tial and Senatorial candidates assume
that at least one rule in the elections
code may be violated during each elec-
tion? And can future Student Govern-
ment Presidential and Senatorial can-

didates assume that they can co-or-
dinate their campaign efforts with
other committees in order to spend
within the expenditure limits? (The lat-
ter question does not imply Steve Cun-
dra’s guilt. It merely points to the
problem of the Election Committee's
failure to investigate accusations.)

It seems, therefore, that the Stu-
dent Government Elections Commit-
tee should be hereby disqualified for
actions "in serious violation” of demo-
cratic elections. Or can it be assumed

that since this is the first formal cen J

sureship of SGEC, the Elections Com-
mittee is entitled to one more outland-
ish decision?

The “Generation Gap’

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

"It‘s better to be dead than red"
or "over 30" as the saying might
conceivably go. Along with the
concept of the “silent majority"
that stands staunchly behind the
President ‘must be added another
myth that people hang onto in or-
der to justify their personal prej-
udices—-the so-called "generation
gap." 

The phrase itself smacks of ii-
logic. In the first place. the word
gap implies a difference between
two otherwise connected points.
like a gulley or a broken line;

In the context of this essay it in-
fers the difference between points
of view. Two points of view. No
one with an ounce of intelligence
or awareness could defend the be-
lief that there exists only two
trends of thought in this country.
If so. the proliferation of minor-
ities and interests groups would
not be a reality. But it is.

THE SECOND point that ren-
ders the hallowed concept of a

_"generation gap" invalid lies in

the premise that people differ in
their outlooks simply because of
age. If carried through. this would

1 allow littledeviation.

How could one explain the thou-
sands of "over-30" type faces that
braved the Washington weather to
take part in the march last year.
orjon the other. "The students“
as they called themselves who
marched to protest the Common
Facilitiesysit-in of last April‘?

The_in-fighting among students
onvthis campus over the ROTC is-
sue could only be termed a fluke if
the theory that the members of
the generations have banded to-
gether holds true.

SO, THE divisions in thought
between peoples cannot be ex-
plained on the basis of age. nor
can it be proven that there is "a
gap...

The divisions that do exist
germinate because of ideological
considerations. Decidedly. there
are ideology gaps in this and ev-
ery other place where more than
five people get together. minor-
ities,political, social and other-
are formed and operate on basis
of differences. 0

_ But myth will be likely to take
precedent over logic. as is the
custom. And many will still fear
that Wild in the Streets may be-
come a reality.

A New McCarthyism?

by FRANK DONATELLI
Contributing Writer

Several days ago. I had the oc-
casionof speaking with a local
young a_ctivist here at Pitt. The
discussion eventually centered
around "repression" in the United
States. He ranted and- raved to me
about the Chicago Eight «now sev-
en». the "extermination” of the
Black Panthers. and the rebirth
of "Mc(,‘arthyism" in America.

/"l fear that we have entered a
new era of McCarthyism." he
moaned. "He was the worst dem-
agogue this country ever had. His
ii'i*esponsibleiaé.tions instilled fear
into the hearts of decent people."

“il see what you mean." I said.
"Gangs smashing windows. loot-

. ing stores. firbombing buildings.

students seizing buildings. ran-
sacking offices —— yes. this new
.VlcCarthyism is certainly terrify-
mg,"

“I WASN’T speaking of that."
he said irritably. "Sometimes it is
necessary to resort to violence to
let the racist establishment know
where we stand. But .\lcCarthy
was a rotten sneak. He would send
his goons snooping around ancient
' stinguished citizens.

that?"

"l‘ should say not." I replied.
"That isn‘t right at all. Why. were
witnessing a good example of that
right now."

“AH, I told you so." he beamed.
"Who‘s getting the screw-—Abbie.

"None of them.“ lanswered. "l I

"Carswell is a hard core racist
and that speech proved it.“ he

“BUT HOW does that differ
from what McCarthy . .  ".\'o
dammit. it’s not the same thing at
all. Can't you see the difference?
I must say. your kind is 'dense.‘”

By now. he was thoroughly in-
censed at me and my inability to
understand him. His eyes blazed
with righteous indignation. But he
made one last stab to make me un-

Election(s)
Rapped

Again

Editor. The Pitt News:

In the past Student Government
elections which. to say the least.
have had some irregularities a
few questions are raised in my
mind and I hope in the minds of
other students.

‘Firstly. the Elections Commit-
tee. which ruled to disqualify Cun-
dra and his stooges. disqualified
him for the exact reasons that
they censured him in the first elec-
tion—over expenditures and fail-
ing to remove campaign material.
Why. then. did they not just dis-
qualify him from the first elec-
tion instead of ruling the election
invalid‘? Why were they afraid to
take a decisive stand the first
time instead of going through all
the bullshit of censuring him
which means nothing.

Secondly. and more important-
ly. is the question of Cundra's
(when I say Cundra. I mean the
people that speak for him and
make all of his decisions) true
feeling for this school. If he is so
concerned about what is happen-
ing here, why is he purposely pro-
testing the election and leaving
the student government at a stand-
still? It seems to me that the only
thing that he is concerned with is
his own selfish interest and not the
interest of the students at Pitt.

~Yellow Jackets Boast
 ' “Giants” On Roster

by ED CONLEY
L 1 Associate Sports Editor
 Frequent bowl appearances have gained a good reputation
, for ‘football in the Deep South, but Dixie basketball hasn’t-been
  given a similar prestige. But Buzz Ridl, the Panther head coach,
 ’ feels that the roundball game in the South is pretty tough and

 that the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets will probably prove it in
their game against the Jungle Cats tonight at 8:15 in the Field

_ _.House.

‘ll “Of course, we were initiated
3 to Southern basketball last year

 they showed us a lot of basket-
jj__»‘bal‘l,”, Ridl said. "They’ve got a
"good team besides (Pete) Mara-
vich.

 “It’s good basketball down
 ..there. It’s close to, but probably

’ Conference.” '

LSU and its All-American Mara-
. 1 vich devastated the Panthers last

3‘ ' Green Wave came close to doing
A “the same the next night, winning
' 7 110-89. Ridl doesn’t expect the
3 same thing to happen against the
 Yellow Jackets, but he respects
their ability.

“ ’  “They won some excellent games.

 ‘year. ‘They have only won two in

Salter Takes "°Sun” First

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

Bryant Salter again equalled
his varsity record of 6’10” in
the high jump in the Baltimore
Sun Games Saturday night and the
effort was good enough for a first
place tie in theyevent.

Each week Salter keeps coming
closer and closer to clearing the
seven foot barrier, and this week
was no exception as the junior
from South Hills cleared seven
foot, only to have the bar tipped on
the way down.

“He was over seven feet,” com-
mentioned coach Jim Banner, ‘He
was way up over, but he hit the
bar on the way down. But he’s get-
ting closer.”

Lonnie Dalton of West Chester
and Frank Costello, unattached,
also cleared 6’10” to create the
deadlock.

Both the mile and two mile re-
lay teams gained second place
berths in the Baltimore games.
John Aiken turned in a “very beau-
tiful” anchor leg in the two mile
relay as the thinclads placed sec-
ond to William and Mary. Ban-
ner’s quartet ran a 7:47.2 while
the winning time was clocked at
7:46. A

"Aiken ran one of the finest
races he has ever run." praised
Banner. “He and Bryant perform-
ed as well as anybody at that
meet.” '

In the heavyweight competition
Dave Young pinned Fred Albrecht
in 3 :55, after a reversal.

"It was a real big match for
him.“ stated Adams. "It should
help him a lot."

F&M surprised the matmen in
the middleweights. Andy Noel won
an 8-3 decision over Bud Smeltz,
a substitute for the injured Pat
Lavery. Noel scored on a take
down in the first period and fol-
lowed it by two reversals in the
second period. Smeltz also scored
a reversal in‘the second period
and an escape in the third period.
Noel picked up two points on rid-
ing time.

At 158. Joe ‘Schantz, subbing for
Bud Morris. lost an 8-6 decision to

, Doug’ yWard. In the first period

   

Ken Balkey, Ken Silay and Greg
Rodgers also ran for the thinclads
in the two-mile relay.

The one-mile quartet of Smitty
Brown, Dennis Schatzman, Carlos
Reisen and Dorel Watley also
placed. second with a time of
3:23.8‘. Rutgers won the event in
3:25i.5.

“That time is just about what
we’ve been averaging,” Banner
explained.

BRYANT SAIJER
“$un” Winner

Ward scored on an escape and
Schantz followed it with a take
down. Ward had two take downs
in the second period which Schantz
followed with two escapes. Ward
escaped in the third period but was
penalized a point. Schantz had a
take down in the third period to
give him his final point. A

“We expected to win at 150 and
158." stated Adams. "Schantz and
Smeltz have looked real good in
the practice room but they didn‘t
come through today. Lavery still
has a bad neck and Morris has a
bad shoulder. We wanted to rest
them today."

The grapplers also suffered a
defeat at 118, when _Greg Mickin-
ac was pinned by Chris Black in
6:17., Black, a sophomore, won the

 

Smitty Brown was the victim of
an unforunate break in the 500
yard runas he got shoved off the

track by another runner. "I was

really mad when it happened,”
Smitty commented. “But it’s just
one of those things. It was a real
bad break.”

Bill Kalchkalter, in his first in-
vitational, placed third in his heat
and didn’t qualify for the finals in
thei50 yard high hurdles, but Ban-
ner was well pleased with Kalch-
kalter’s performance considering
the competition he was facing.
“He did a very good job,” the
coach explained. “He was in the
fast heat with Irv Hall and Leon
Coleman. He performed very
well.”

Freshman Doug Degenhart also
got his first taste of invitational
competition in the pole vault and
according to Banner, the fresh-
man learned a lot. The pole vault
competition started at 15’ and De-
genhart holds the current varsity
record of 14’8”.. “We thought he
would get a lot of experience out
of it and we think he learned a
lot,” added Banner.

In a “B” team meet in the Field
House Saturday morning, sopho-
more Don Poretto broke the var-
sity long jump record with a leap
of 23’5”. He had held the old mark
of 23"‘/4” as well. The thinclads
won nine of 11 events.

Black scored in the first period
with a take down and an escape
and a take down in the second.

in the third period and Black fol-

Tom Grant pulled a surprise
victory over John Hilliard at 126.
It was Grant's first victory in two
matches and Hillard had main-
tained 4-0-1 record.

"We felt he could win but didn‘t
really expect him to.” stated
Adams. "They consider Hilliard a
real good boy."

Thriller
To Dukes,

by BILL NAAB

This past Saturday afternoon
turned out to be one of those rare
occasions when the dialogue of the
fans, preceding a Duquesne Duke
varsity encounter, centered
around the prelim (Dukes 74, Cubs
72) and not the main attraction.

If the conversation of the spec-
tators between events was a rep-
resentativeresponse of the over-

’all attendance, then those who

took the effort to travel to the
Arena were furnished a delightful
treat, which even the televising of
the main bout (featuring Du-
quesne and Providence)could not
offer.

"That was the best freshmen
game that I’ve ever seen,” ex-
claimed one roundball buff. An-
other fan mentioned to a friend
that his buddy had just missed a
great prelim. “Those Pitt kids
gave a real good battle.”

With 3:35 remaining in the bat-
tle, the Cubs leveled things off,
68-68. Just seven minutes before
the Little Dukes had led 61-47.
Carl Morris and Marvin Abrams
spearheaded the comeback by
pitching in a combined total of 15
points.

After Morris snatched a sharp
pass from Abrams, the Cubs took
a 72-70 advantage. Steve Scheer-
en’s score knotted the contest
again at 70-70. Then with 1:50
left on the clock Abrams’ field
goal pushed the Cubs ahead.

 

LAST WEEK TO SEE CAGERS
The cagers host Georgia
Tech tonight at 8:15 at the
Field House, beginning their
final week at home for the 1970
season. Wednesday night they
1 will host the Temple Owls in
the Civic Arena in an “experi-
mental” home game, and Fri-
day they will close out the home
schedule with a night contest
against the Orangemen of Syra-

cuse.

 

 

When the momentum appear-
ed to be streaking in the Cubs di-
rection, the fortunes switched.
The Dukes added four, tallies
while Don Wilson’s failure on the
first of a one-and-one foul situa-
tion was sandwiched between a
few stray Cub passes.

Cub forward Buzzy Harrison
had one last chance to salvage his
squad’s efforts in the final three
seconds. His high-arching 15-foot
fling at the hoop bounced off the
rim, however.

The Cubs led during most of the
first half. After holding an early
12-5 lead. they yielded to the on-
charging Dukes with 4:37 remain-
ing in the half. 27)26. Throughout
the entire first ‘half. the Dukes
smothered the Cub big men. Mor-
ris and Sulkowski and at intermis-
sion the Cubs trailed 39-33.

Dejected cub coach Tim Grgu—
rich remarked. “We did a great
job in the second half. When you-‘re
down by as much as we were and
then come back. you deserve to
win."

The Dukes' advantage in free
throw attempts. 36-16. negated
the Cubs’ field goal superiority.
Abrams. Harrison. and Morris
scored 21. 19. and 16 points. re-
spectively. Jack Wojdowski of Du-
quesne paced all scoring with 22

points. “ y  V

Gyrnnasts Stamped By

Powerful Navy Team,

Tangle Slippery Rock

by PETE NYCHIS

Coach Warren Neiger’s gynasts took a trip to Annapolis,
Md., Saturday afternoon and wish they had never gone down

there.

The occasion was a duel gymnastic meet with the Midship-
men of Navy, and Neiger’s gynasts came at the opposite end of a
153.50—127.25 score. This was the second straight defeat for the

gymnasts and their record now
drops to 2-4 overall and 0-4 in
league competition where the ac-
tion gets rougher.

Navy was led by Bob Mackey
who took firsts in the side horse
(9.4), long horse (9.2), parallel bars
(8.8), and high bar (8.55). He also
took a second in the free exercise
with an 8.9. He easily won the all-
around with a total score of 53.35.
Klotz was the other first "place
winner for Navy in the still rings
with 8.85.

Neiger said, “Mackey was the

A guy that hurt us. He was pretty

good.” ,_

The lone first for Neiger’s
squad was won by Loweel Meek
with a 9.2 in the floor exercise.
“He was the highlight for us,”
said Neiger. “He was on the spot
because our other free exerciser,
Ron Ludwig, wasstill nursing a
leg he injured earlier in the year
and did not compete.”

Joe Gracik took Ludwig’s place
and finished third. The coach said,
“He got a bad break but he did a
good job.” Gracik also took third
in the long horse (8.55) and side
horse (8.25). In addition he scored
a 7.65 in the still rings.

Dave Andrew managed to take
second in a long horse competi-
tion by scoring a 8.75. Steve Weiss
showed improvement in the still
rings with a strong showing and
scored an 8.1.

One gymnast who gave a disap-
pointing performance was Jim
Billec. Neiger said, “Jim just had
a bad day. He was disgusted but
he’ll come around.” Billie only
managed to score a 19.85 in the all-
around.

Most of the team wasn’t disap-
pointed though because they knew

’ the ability that Navy has to rack-

up the points with ease.

“They had a real strong team.
I’m sure_ they’ll win the rest of
their meets. I don’t know how

anyone could have beaten them.—

Our team should have given them

a battle but we didn’t. We didn’t

hit as we should have. I know we
should have scored higher than we
did.” 0 .

The gymnasts travel to Slippery
Rock tomorrow for an afternoon
meet. Neiger said, “We’re looking
forward to “them.”

Senior Wins °Hoope1"

Larry Lowe, a senior Engineer-
ing student, won the first Super
Hooper Contest, ‘which included
the Panthers’ last three basket-
ball games. His prize is two free
dinners and two tickets to a movie
of his choice.

The contest asked members of
the University community to pre-
dict the difference between the
Panthers’ total points and the to-
tal of their opponents in the games.

The Jungle Cats lost the first
game to St. Johns, 67-58; then
won the second over Carnegie-
Mellon, 72-56; and lost the third
to. Lafayette, 80-74, in overtime.
Those scores totaled gave the Cats
204 points and their opposition
203. That’s a difference of a lone
point.

Lowe was one of three contest-
ants to select a difference of one
point, so the final decision was
based on the tie breaker, Pitt’s to-
tal points.

The senior almost called the
point-total’ perfectly. He predict-
ed 203, missing by only one. Herm
Donatelli and Len Pasquarelli
were the others who hit the dif-
ferent part of the contest. Dona-
telli missed the Panther total by
eight (predicting 212) and Pas-
quarelli missed by 12 (choosing
192).

Terps Drown Tankers

by JERRY MYERS

Succumbing to an awesome
barrage ‘of superior swim-
ming, the Pitt mermen drop-
ped their third meet of the sea-
son Saturday to the invading tank-
ers from the University of Mary-
land, 70-43.

Trying his best to combat the
Terps’ well-balanced attack,
Coach Bill Grant managed to man-
neuver his swimmers around and

‘ came up with a few affective com-

binations. Pitting the Panthers’
strength against lVIaryland’s was
no easy feat and in the end the re-
sults turned out much the way the
coach expected.

According to assistant coach
Dick Bradshaw, “The meet turn-
ed out about the way we expected.
We eased up in the beginning and
they, eased up in the end. No mat-
ter how we swam if we couldn’t
have scored any more.”

Grant was in complete agree-
ment. He also added that “some
of the Maryland swimmers didn’t
come because they were sick.
Maryland beat West Virginia on
Friday night by about the same
score. I think we scored a few

more points than West Virginia
did against them.”

The meet wasn’t really that
close at any point past the second
event. The Maryland 400 medley
relay team streaked to a new
Trees Pool record with a time of
3:444. They took little time in
coming back with freshman Jim
Clifford in the very next event to
set a new pool record in the 1000
yard freestyle event with a time
of -10:31.7. Clifford also won the
500 yard freestyle vent handily
with a time of 5209.8.

Things wern’t completely
hopeless though. Rich Rowe de-
lighted the crowd with a first
place finish in the 200 yard free-
style event with a time of 1:527.
The most exciting event for the
Pitt fans though was the last event
of the day. the 400 yard free-
style relay race which the Pan-
thers copped with a time of 3126.2.

The mermen managed to take
four first places out of the 13
events and as predicted, Dave
Wessel won two of them. Grant
said, “Dave was diving a little be-
low par today but he still came
through. Those two and a half
tur_n_s are tough dives.”

Maryland proved just too pow-. if
erful for the Panthers though as -,3 J!
the Terps took nine events and at i 
one point had a string of five 
straight going for them. In the 200  
yard butterfly, Dave Anderson” 
stayed with Maryland’s McDon-. 

ald for half the race but then fell

behind, finishing third. Al Morris 
stayed even in the breast stroke ~ 2 

but couldn’t pull it out. Maryland

streaked out in front in the 100 
yard freeestyle as Pitt never had j 

a chance. Most of the meet fol_,low-

ed this pattern. The Panthers take  A '
on Grove City tomorrow afternoon .  "
