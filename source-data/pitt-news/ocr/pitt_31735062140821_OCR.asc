The Army needs more men like

:.'Ha'rry Cayton.

”He’ll be 71 in June, and from
seven till four every day except
Sunday, he helps the butcher and
cooks who prepare meals in the
cafeteria for the Air Cadets.

, Born in Little Washington, Penn-
sylvania, Mr. Cayton lived there
until 25 years-ago, when he moved
to Homestead. His home is now in
Pittsburgh, on South N egley ave-
nue.

Mr. Cayton retired from his po-
sition at the Carnegie Natural Gas
company, where he was‘ foreman
for 27 years, but to look at his gray,
wavy hair, nobody would believe
that this man was of normal re-

tiring age. After such an active
life, loaﬁng didn’t appeal to him,
so he now has this job under Army
supervision.

One of Mr. Cayton’s two sons is
’with the Army Engineers in Arkan-

"/lr sas. He attended Pitt, and was an
,{ engineer for the Cathedral. Per-

haps that accounts for the fact that
‘Mr. Cayton buys War Bonds regu-

restricted to freshman and sophomore cadets, has expanded
its membership requirements to include any student in the
University enrolled in ROTC or who has completed basic mili-

  

tary science training.

This new regulation will open

the membership to junior and se-
nior men who previously have
been eligible only for the large
Pitt Marching Band, and eligible
for this, only if they had been a
member of the ROTC Band in their
freshman and sophomore years.
However, the existing regulation
that application for the Pitt
Marching Band can be made only
if the applicant has had the neces-
sary marching experience with the
ROTC Band, still stands. This, of
course, means that juniors and se-
niors must have completed basic
ROTC training, and must have
played with the ROTC band while

Fraternity,3tatus
Given By News

Correct facts about the three
men’s fraternities, Phi Kappa,
Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Mu,
as to their status at the University,
have been released by the secre-
tary of the Men’s Fraternity Com-
niittee, Roy H. Umble.

Mu chapter of Phi Kappa is of-
ﬁcially not “active” at the Univer-
sity as of March 20, 1943. Further
action is being delayed in this case
until a more complete report can
be made, and a full statement con-
cerning the closing of all accounts.

Alpha Beta chapter of Theta Chi
is recognied by the fraternity com-
mittee as not being active at the
University as of March 1, 1943.

The report on Sigma Alpha Mu is
that: “since February 1, 1943, the
chapter has been operating with-
out its chapter house on Neville

Street.” However they plan to con- 1

tinue as an active chapter and will
be represented in the undergradu-
ate Interfratei-nity Council.

Athletic,/Vlusical Equipment if

LEE PMCFADDEN, ELAINE KAHN, CLARK SHAUGHNESSY

Tomorrow will mark the ﬁrst
day of the campus drive to bring
in athletic equipment and musical
instruments for war prisoners.
Part of a city-wide drive, it will
last for three days ending on Fri-
day.

A booth will be set up in the
Commons Room where the goods
may be turned in and a. special cer-
tiﬁcate of appreciation . has been
prepared for all those making con-
tributions.

Sponsored by the International
YMCA and with the cooperation of
the Red Cross, the equipment is
being collected to provide the pris-
oners of war with ways of occupy-
ing their minds and their time. Ar-
rangements have already been
made with the Red Cross for space
on supply ships to carry the goods
to the camps.

The list of equipment being
sought includes violins, cellos,
guitars, banjos, mandolins, ukele-
les, clarinets, oboes, basso-ons, Eng-
lish horns, trumpets, cornets, trom-
bones, alto and tenor horns, French
horns, piccolos, ﬁfes, drums, ac-
cordions, harmonicas, occarinas,
portable phonographs, baseballs,

bats, gloves and mitts, footballs,
volleyballs and nets, softballs, ice
hockey sticks and skates, ﬁeld
hockey sticks and balls, tennis
rackets, balls, nets, shoes, basket-
balls and baskets, badminton rack-
ets, shuttlecocks, nets, deck tennis
rings and nets, table tennis pad-
dles, balls and nets, boxing gloves,
medicine balls, and curling balls.
A brief idea of what this equip-
ment means to war prisoners was
presented by Dr. Conrad Hoffman.

who is now supervising the work «

among prisoners of war in the
USA and Jamaica. He spoke be-
fore the cainpus committee last
Friday. Dr. Hoffman told just how
much a musical instrument or a.
game means to a man who has ab-
solutely nothing to do but wait . . .-

for the duration, and he termed a

the giving of equipment a way of
helping those prisoners to make
“captivity a captive.”

Elaine Kahn, C44, chairman of
the campus drive, urged both stu-
dents and faculty to make contri-
butions. “It won’t cost you any-
thing except the efforts of bring-
ing it in, and it will do so much
for those unfortunate enough to be
prisoners of war,” she declared.

WSGA Amendment Abolishes
"Fresh" Women Unit Systems

Women of the University voted
to amend the by-laws of the Wom-
en's Self Government association
constitution,’ at a special meeting
yesterday.

Main feature of the amendments
is aprogram to replace the unit
system for freshman women. Under
the new by-laws, freshman women
will be permitted to serve as ap-
prentices to activities on campus
under the guidance of upperclass

women. These women will be se-_

lected by the activities which they
represent and not by WSGA, as

'were the unit advisers in the past.

They will begin training programs

 

for the freﬂmen  8.001: as the

   

mentor period closes.

Freshman Council will be com-
posed of representatives elected
from the orientation classes and
will be presided over by the vice-
president of WSGA. The vice-pres-
ident will also act as chairman of
the Freshman -Activities board
which will be composed of the up-
perclass women elected as trainers
from the activities on campus.

Membership to Commission, the
legislative body of WSGA‘, has been
extended to representativesufrom all
recognized activities on campus to
which more than 10 women belong,
except social fraternities which are

re9.r9aeet_e§ hr Ifanlisllenic-. 

 

means that some honorary fraterni-
ties, never before represented, will
have members in Commission.

Suggestion for the amendments’
came from Senior Court. The
changes were accepted by executivo
committee of WSGA last Tuesday
and by Commission on Thursday.
According to the existing by-laws
of the constitution, an aﬂirmativo
vote of two-thirds of the ballots
cast at a meeting of the Association
is necessary to make an amendment
official, providing it has been passed
by three-fourths of Commission;
That was the purpose of the meet-
ing yesterday.

The amendments will be printed ,

uPitt Bond and Stamp Sales

Show Marked lncrease

On the heels of a decided upswing in sales of stamps and

- mittee.

Phi Mu fraternity acted as associate salesmen last Wed- H"

. bonds, comes the announcement of a nationwide “Jeep a Week”
campaign modeled after an original effort of the local com-

nesday and the committee took in $1,174.30, a ﬁgure which
more than doubled the weekly quota of $500, the price of a

single jeep. To date 33 jeeps have
been sent to the ﬁghting forces by
students and faculty of the Uni-
.versity since last October.

It is the hope of the Treasury
Department to have all the na-
tion’s universities purchase at least
one jeep each week, so that by
May 10 America’s colleges will
have contributed 10,000 jeeps to
the Army. Each jeep is decorated
with the insignia of the college
which provides, through stamp and
bond sales, the- $500 necessary to
build and equip one of these rug-

- ged little automobiles.

of the Treasury Morganthau is to

quite satisfactory. The drive start-

incomplete records so far, show a
fifty percent increase over last

is quite commendable,” he said,
“considering the largest majority

rate of a “jeep a week” until April
19. Stamps of all denominations
plus Series E bonds are the only

issues which can be counted in this
campaign, although bonds of oth-
er types are still being sold by col-
lege groups.

With three weeks to go, the lo-
cal committee is several jeeps
ahead of the “jeep a week” sched-
ule, and plans to increase sales
volume still further. The results of
recent sales at State Hall indicate
a good ﬁeld for future develop-

Tomorrow the women of Chi

BABES IN ARMS COMMITTEE

Pitt Co-eds To Take Over

Publication For Duration

By JUNE THOMSON

With our country’s entrance into
the war, every phase of University
life, social and educational, was
disrupted. The Pitt News, was no
exception. Aside from the war short-
age of materials such as lead and
paper, etc., the publication’s most
serious problem has been the de-
pletion of its staff due to induction
into the armed services.

There is only one solution to this
difiiculty: Pitt women must take
over until the boys come back.

For women who are interested in
publications, either with an eye to-
wards a future profession or only as
a college activity, there is great op-
portunity. Women are gradually
taking over more authority on the
News.

This past year, Elaine Kahn
was chosen ﬁrst woman sport’s

videimembers of the Pitt March-
ing Band with more experience
and training, and in this way,
will help to keep the Pitt Band
the outstanding part of the Uni-
versity’s extra curricular’ activi-
ties that it is.”

The ROTC Band was organized
two years ago to provide music for
the military parades and cere-
monies that are conducted during

Wednesday activities. hour by the
entire unit of the University's
ROTC. The music is under the di-

‘ rection of T. M. Finney, professor

and head of Pitt’s music appre-
ciation department. Student leaders
of the organization are D. H. De-
saulniers, BA44, drum coach; R. E.
Davis, C43, drum major; and W.
C. McClintock, C44, music captain.
Lieutenant Finnerty, is drill mas-
ter of both the ROTC Band and the
Pitt Marching Band.

editor of the paper; Lois Row-
bottom became campus editor, and
most of her staff is composed of
women; workers on the copy desk
are chieﬂy women. When the men
in advanced ROTC are called, even
more vacancies will be left to be
ﬁlled by the Pitt co-eds.

Working on the News offers good
practical experience for anyone with
writing or a newspaper career in
mind. There is, of course, a chance

,to exercise writing ability, but from
a mechanical standpoint work on the
copy desk is even more important.
In proofreading other’s writing mis-
takes, one’s own grammar and com-
position is improved. The organiza-
tion and makeup of the paper itself
is also learned while working on a
paper. Actual time spent at making
up a page and writing heads con-
tributes more to an understanding
of the workings of a newspaper than
all the facts that can be learned
from books.

But work on the paper isn’t
limited exclusively to oﬂice work.
Every week members of the stalf
and the editors go to the printers
to read galley proofs and set type.
Pitt co-eds arelearning to read
lead slugs upside down and back-
wards instead of the latest love
novels; they are setting type and
staining their hands with printer's
ink in place of spending their
spare time crocheting or ta-tting.
And the co-eds like the work.

The News provides phases of
newspaper work that are calculated
to satisfy various interests. For
girls who like to write and contact
people, there are the editorial and
reporting staffs. There is layout
and copy work for those interested
in the technical side of newspaper
work. And for those who wish prac-
tical experience in advertising and
comptrolling, there is the business
staff. Financial work on the news-
paper is especially of value because
it offers a chance to work at and
solve actual problems.
