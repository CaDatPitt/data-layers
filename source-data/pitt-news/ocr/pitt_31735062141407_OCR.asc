great interest_ in the scheduled meet-
ing for they appreciate that not many
opportunities ‘arise ,- to hear two
United States -Senators,’-both alumni
of the University, and probably the
next Governor‘ of Pennsylvania from
the same platform at the same time.

Several students, admirers of the
three candidates, have announced
that they intend to organize a large

meeting in a body and that they are
making efforts to have a blockof

SIMILAR mums Amu

Pennsylvania State College has
adopted a. plan very similar to the
University of Pittsburgh plan of foot-
ball ticket distribution in connection
with the alumni membership, the fol-
lowing instructions being sent out to
their alumni! recently embodying reso-
lutions on the distribution of tickets

adopted at their meeting in Pittsburgh.

August 3, 1922: .

“Preference will be given to active
members of the Alumni Association
who send in their orders within thir-

hty days after the mailing of the foot-

ball ‘mail order blanks, from the Ath-
letic Association oﬂice.. This is on
condition that the statusof» the Alum-
ni ‘shall be determined bythe Alumni
—.Sec1'etary and that he shall submit to
the Athletic Association office a list
of paid up members of the Alumni
Association «by noon of the thirtieth
day after th'e_ blanks are ~ mailed.

“For the Pittsburgh game ‘the two
ticket limit per alumnus and per stu-
dent.on all seats (Grand Stand and
Box), will be enforced. .A pledge is
requested from each alumnus" order-
ing tickets that ‘he personally will oc-
cupy one seat., It was also requested
that‘ each student buying tickets sign
a pledge that either he or a member
of his--immediate family will occupy
one seat.” .

The prices for the Penn State games

: run from $3 to $6 per game, with the

Navy drawing the latter ﬁgure for
box seats and $3 for grandstand seats.
Tickets for games at State College
run fro'm.$2 to $3.

quite a popular place for the alumni
these days,and while “Pop” Warner
will eventually want secret practice
there, he is not averse to the grads be-
ing permitted to see the teamwork
out, when properly identiﬁed. Dur-.
ing the past week quite‘ a few of the
a’1fu_mni came up, especially during the
first few days. One of the most en-
thusiastic Pittites‘ who wanted to see
the place _was C. W. Ridinger, and he
voted." it as more than coming up‘ to ex-
pectations. Gardner Steel, who was
a track star 25 years-"ago and now
prominent oil operator, also" paid a
visit and is enthusiastic over it. Dr.
P. V. McParland, Allan Collingwood,
Ed Eckard: and other celebrities were
visitors..

I, would. I had a little hard "time
locatin’ myself here. This place ain’t
no small institution ‘by no means.
You know you could put three normal
schools like is back in our country
in a building here. called Alumni hall.
That’s where I had All my trouble.
They lined us allup and we had to
go to‘ a dozen places and do a lot
of waitin‘ and ﬁll out" a lot of cards
and it all had a grand climax, as our
English says, by us having. to pay

There is lots of smart lookin’ gals
around , here too. I heard one ‘boy
call them ﬂappers. That must mean
something -like a pancake, cooked
nice on the outside. but not much in-
side. The fellows here are all regu-
lar city guys, they all dress nice.
Some fellow says to me, says ‘he

A big‘ guy _like you oughtn’t to have
a hard time making the frosh team.”
So I asks all about it and he takes
me to see their coach.‘ He said to
"me his name was Mr. Somebody but
I afterwards heard him call him Pop.
I don’t -believe "it was his" pop the
way he -‘acted tho. ' Mr; turned

goin" to learn how to play football
now. You even‘ get hospitol treat-
ment-free if your out for ‘football.

I have to wear an awful lookin”

fellows do that are just enterin’. It,
is blue -with a yellow beak and but-
ton. If I knowed_ we had to buy‘
these things I wouldn’t have got that
pretty red one that I did’ because we
have to wear these‘ all the time. o

A fellow told me we had to sleep
in them but I think his kiddin’ don’t
you. . Some fellow gave me the deuce

when you wear‘ a cap. like I spoke
about, you can*l'. talk to them and
you ‘can't smoke neither. Not much
use me gettin’_'permissi-on to smoke’
that corn cob if you can’t smoke ‘it
where the fellows can see you. Well,
this is about all. I’ll write next"
week.  

Yours for study,
Your son,

Oh, yes here we are again! Oh,

on the dear old campus ragain-.-—som‘e

some to flunk. Who knows? If we
only knew what was in store for us
maybe‘ we would shoot our marbles

 

we Hope everybody has come back
with the idea to get _down to work
immediately—--(cause that’s the usual
story) of course, we never do carry
out the original plan but it’s best
to have-it some .time—even if we
never carry it -out. ‘Gosh, there is so
‘much to say and we only havela lit-

guess we’ll have to save it untill later.

our Extramural Division. Twenty-six
centers have been established within
the city limits and a total registration
of 750 more has been reported by the
Division through centers established
outside of Pittsburgh, making 1,500.”
In relation to the division of series
in the University, Mr. Quick added:
“The percentage of, men and women
runs about 70 to_ 30. Among the un-
dergraduate classiﬁed students the
percentage in ‘men and women is 7-5

gives a greaterpercentage of women,
the increase of women being due to
large number of teachers registered
in late afternoon _ and Saturday

   NEXT THURSDAY

 

With a whoop and a hang, the Sec-

ond Story Marry Good Fellowship day ‘

begins to commence to start next
Thursday, October 5, at noon over at
the “Y”' Hut. '

This is a twice yearly event with
Morry, ‘who comes out all bedecked
with smokes, eats and a bunch of en-
tertainers just to give the fellows a
taste of what a. real person, is.

For the beneﬁt of those who don't‘
know him—that handful of Freshies
perhaps who came from the outlying
wilds of Canada and Mexico-Morry
is a clothier, that’s all he sells——men’-s
suits and overcoats, ‘but boy, how he
does sell them. It’s a recognized fact
on the campus that a well dressed col-
lege man is a. Second Story Morry cus-
tomer. He gets the cream of the
young fellows’ trade, because he ca-
ters to young men.

He’s located upstairs on the [second
ﬂoor, at the busiest corner in town.
But his rent is 86 percent lower than
first ﬂoor locations, and he has no ex-
pensive windowtrims,’ ﬂoor walkers,
bad charge a,_cc.ounts and other ex-
pense-s,.which the average. store must

contend‘ with. The result is you can I

buy the best -clothes in" town" at
p-rices- $10 to .$1_5 less and guaranteed
to be less. ' .~ . _

Well, Morry will be with us next
Thursday. All Pittites are his guests
at the “Y” Hut, starting 12 sharp.

'I‘he big outstanding feature of the
contest was the ﬁne showing the Pitt
substitutes made when they were sent
into the game in the second half.

The scoring was distributed tl11'ough
all four quarters. Pitt tallied once
each in the first two quarters and
twice in eact of the last two. Cm-
cinnati never was in a threatening
position. ;

The feature play of the game came

‘late in the fourth ‘quarter, when Boh-_

ren broke away around l_eft end and

then cut over to the right side of the

field and run 53 yards to the goal line.
This was the closing touchdown of
the game. Bohren was a SeI1Sati0I1

being equally as brilliant as his run-

Cross country was started Monday

with “Eek” Hays in command and
“Ted” Corbett as ﬁrst-lieutenant. A
new course beginning and‘ ending at
the_lndoor Track has been laid out
and quite a number followed the
lea:d«ers the ‘first -day. - -
' The runs will be held three times

age of fifty men ou-t each day in

sity in A. A. U. competition.
further partic‘.ilars see Director Mil-
ler.

The prospects for _a strong Fresh-
man track team do not look particu-
larly! bright at this time, unless
Coach Shea shows unusual qualities
as a developer of unexperienced ma
terial, or possibly some ‘stars un-
known to our athletic authorities re-
main hidden among the la.rge enter-
ing Freshman classes.

Jack Dieubold from Canton, Ohio.
and Cowan. and Ben , Jones from

Schenley, are three sprinters of abil- .
' ity who have

registered. Marion
Hawkins from Columbiana, Ohio, is
a good pole vaulter and high jumper,
and J. P. Phifer is a hurdler who
captained Wilkinsburrg High last
Spring. There are some weight men
of ability, but distance runners seem
to be scarce. ‘ -

.Director Miller would like to have
all Freshmen who _ will be out for
track report to him at their earliest
convenience, ‘and would appreciate
information regarding any new track
material now in school.

TENNIS MADE MAJIIR

SPﬂRT_ll_T IJNIVERSITY

In keeping with the progressive
spirit of the Pitt athletic authorities,
tennis has been made a major sport

at the University. ' The great interest

that is being sh-own at Pitt, as well
as every other school, convinced the
Athletic Council that the‘ time was
ripe for making tennis a major
sport. _iThis move has been com-
mended by all =local net enthusiasts,
and within a short time should bring
Pitt to the front'in collegiate tennis
circles. ' ‘
