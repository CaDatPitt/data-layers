A .-Dr. Joh-n G. Bowman, chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh,
today announced the appointment of Dr. Alexander J. Allen as West-
inghouse graduate professor of engineering effective November 1.

He received the master of arts degree from New
9 York university in 1926 and two years later the doctor of philosophy

mained at that university, ﬁrst as
an instructor in physics and later
as research associate.

After one year with the Bartol
Research foundation, he joined the

While at Pitt, Dr. Allen design-
ed and supervised the building of
an “atom smasher,” which will be
put in service after the war, and
devised methods for making spec-
ial electronic tubes. In late 1939
he was, granted a leave of ab-
sence to direct research activities

Pitt War Fund

Drive Begins

Campaign for stu-dent contribu-
tions to the United War fund will
come to the University next Wed-
nesday and Thursday, November
1 and 2.

Dick Briney, C, and Phyllis
Krieger, C, co-chairmen of the
campaign at the University, stress
the fact that 75 per cent of every
dollar contributed by students will
remain on the campus to help
support ﬁve school organizations:
the men’s student loan fund, the
women's student loan fund. Pitt-
in-China, YWCA, and YMCA.
The fund also contributes to the
USO and‘ ‘war relief socitie-s of
our allies, and a portion will re-
main within Pittsburgh to sup-
port 80 social agencies.

Motto of this year’s drive is
“Care enough to give enough.”
Goal at Pitt this year is 100 per
cent participation, with an aver-
age contribution of two dollars
per student. Some, the committee
feels, will want to give more
having more money than in norm-
al times because of summer or
part time jobs.

Chairmen in charge of the drive
are Dick Briney, and Phyllis
Krieger. Heads of sub-committees
are: Bill Veenis, E, publicity
chairman; J-can Kimpel, C, in
charge of billing; ‘Shirley Sheifler,
C, head of the personal solicitation
committee; Lucille Morgan, E,
chairman in charge of campaign
envelopes; Vic Stein, C, chairman
for obtaining speakers; and Penn
Burke, BA, booth chairman.

Facultymembers acting as ad-
visers for the campaign are Theo-
dore W. Biddle, dean of men; Miss
Harriett Glasser, assistant to the
dean of women; Robert Arthur,
counsellor to student activities,
and Mrs. Edna Batz, executive
secretary of YWCA.

The committee would like con-
tributions to be personal, and to
come from the student’s own
budget.

Red Cross Needs
Typists, Clerks

As their first «activity this year.
the War Activities committee will
supply girls to do typing and ﬁl-
ing work at the Red ‘Cross Blood
bank in the Wabash building. The
committee is calling on all girls
who have free time from six to
nine -o’clock weekday evenings or
all day Saturday to sign up at the
booth on the ground floor.

Girls from the committee will
be in the booth from 9:30 until
3:30 today, Thursday, and Friday
to receive applicants. Girls may
choose any evening and come as
often as possible.

The War Activities committee is
made up of representatives from
each of the women’s activities.
Chairman, Virginia King, C, an-
nouncd that the committee will
sponsor other activities connected
with the war effort in the future.

Urged To

Register

Due to high interest among the students the reorganization

of the University band is now in progress.

The return of Bob

Arthur, assistant to the dean of men, to the campus last week
was the ﬁrst step in this direction.
In a statement made last Monday, Mr. Arthur said: “Every

possible eﬁort will be made to return the band to an active

plications, and complete up-to-
the-minute information on the
Young Men’s Christian associa-
tion activities at Pitt, the Y cab-
inet and its campaigners will can-
vass the campus -this week for
prospective members. Applica-
tions already have been taken at
the ground ﬂoor booth and the Y
office on the 8th ﬂoor.

This year’s membership drive
committee is composed of Leon-
ard Shore, C, chairman, and
Stephen Buoh-er, C, publicity.
Representing the committee of
fraternity men who will aid in
the drive are ‘Bob Delason, SAE;
Stan Goering, Delt; John Davis,
PiKA; Stan Lencher. -Phi Ep;

Climaxing the week's member-
ship drive the YMCA will hold
membership training Friday eve-
ning at 8 o'clock in the social
room of the Stephen Foster me-
morial. Speakers will be F. A.
Robinson, president of the Pi-tts-
burgh downtown Y, and players
of the Pitt—Card football teams.

freshments will be served after-
wards.

Heading the social committee is
Frank McWade, student president
of the YMCA .at Pitt.

Senator Burton Speaks
On Foreign Policy

The Foreign Policy association
had its first meeting of the year
in the Stephen Foster memorial
last Monday. The subject discuss-
ed was “The Foreign Policy of the
United States in Western Europe.”
Following the principal address
by Senator Harold H. Burton of
Ohio, an open forum was held.
The Economic club of Pittsburgh
co-sponsored the meeting.

The Foreign Policy association.
a non-partisan organization with
branches in '26 cities. is devoted
to the public discussion of inter-
national relations.

°status with the hope that it may

be able to appear in the stadium
before the close of the present
football season. Such an effort
will entail a considerable amount
of work on the part of all con-
cerned if an efficient and compe-
tent musical organization is to be
developed as quickly as desired.”

“It is urgent that immediate
action be taken towards determin-
ing what students are available for
participation in the band. To this
end all men students whose musi-
cal training and experience ‘have
been such that-they feel they could
make worthwhile contributions are
zsked to call at the dean of men’s
office as soon as possible to register
as candidates for band member-
ship.”

According to George Wright, C,
and Al Pontiere, C, who have been
assisting Mr. Arthur in reorgan-
ization, the number of candidates
already on application for mem-
bership show that there is a great
desire on the part of the student
body to have a band once more
play in the stadium.

Cooperation and willingness to
work are needed however. The
time limit is not long if the band
is to make an appearance at a
football game this year. That is
why all those who have the ex-
perience and time necessary are

asked to apply at the dean of
men’s ofﬁce now.

Adjutant Releases
ROTC Data

No period of service in the
armed forces may be substituted
for the basic (freshman & sopho-
more) reserve ofﬁcer’s training
course, which is a prerequisite for
the advanced (junior & senior)
course in the senior division, ac-
cording to a recent directive from
the adjutant general’s office in
Washington.

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, said that most of the present
veterans are not eligible for either
course so this will not concern
them. The ROTC and physical
education requirements for gradu-
ation are being waived by the
University for all incoming fresh-
man veterans. However, for all
men wishing to.take the advanced
course, when it is resumed after
the war, it must be emphasized
that no one will be permitted to
take the advanced course who has
not completed the basic course, re-
gardless of other military service
he may have had.

Major Merlin V. Wills, com-
mandant of the military depart-
ment, stated in conjunction with
the order, “In general, we do not
encourage the veterans to take
ROTC for the simple reason that
most of them have already had a
training which goes far beyond
the elementary type of course they
get here.

THEPITT NEWS

By Lee Mclnerny

Last week, right on the front
page of ‘the Pitt News where no
one could miss seeing it, there
was an article in which Miss
Cramblet, new manager of the
Tuck Shops, asked for student
suggestions concerning improve-
ments in said Shops. One of the
most important improvements
that I think could be made is the
food. It seems as if a lot of the
fellows and girls are eating it
because it’s the only thing around
to ﬁll their stoma-chs. So we’re
oﬁ again.

The ﬁrst difficulty to be faced
is, there is a University ruling
that no cooking can be done in
the Cathedral. All baking and
sandwich ﬁllings for the Tuck
Shop is d-one at the University
cafeteria and is brought to the
Cathedral every morning by truck.
That means Miss Cramblet
couldn’t possibly variate the food
to any marked degree, and we’ll
just have to take that into con-
sideration in the future.

However, there must be some
other” way in which the sandwich-

es could be concocted. It might be

petty to say this, but the spiced
ham that’s used is stale, especial-
ly around the edges; the egg salad
is almost as thin as butter, and
people only take -the ham salad
sandwiches when there aren’t any

of the others left. A lot of the
stu-dents eat cheese sandwiches
ﬁve days a week; they say the
others are soggy, and it’s the
truth.

Even the slightest deviation
from the sandwich routine is wel-
come. A few weeks ag-o, we had
the good fortune of having pea-
nut butter between our two slices
of bread, and the grab for them
was almost phenomenal. That,
however, was only for a day, and
there has been ,no repetition of
it since.

No one is complaining about
the pri-ces. They’re reasonable,
and we appreciate that fact. But
we would also appreciate having
the lunch—hour food stepped up
to the par of the rolls served in
the morning. The rolls are fresh,
and combined with a cup of
coffee, they make a good substi-
tute for .a breakfast at home. The
cake served at noon is also a
rather nice dish, and the variety
of dessert-s is much larger than it
has been—-we like the new addi-
tion of pretzels, potato chips, and
the fruit. We’re just unhappy
about the sandwich, and it is hop-
ed Miss Cramblet might do some-
thing about it. This column
wouldn't have been written if it
hadn’t expressed the views of a
great many students.

Rea! 244 7/cu RM

By Deirdre Baird -

The next time your English

professor hands you ‘back a theme
that looks as though he has used
it to staunch a deep stab wound,
don’t be too alarmed. Tha-t’s not
blood, brother; that’s red ink.
The proper etiquettevon your part
is to accept it politely and pre-
tend to examine it thoughtfully
un-til he has passed several rows
beyond you. Then quickly wad

it into a ball and stuff it down.

behind the radiator (or a loose
tile if you happen t-o be sitting on
the other side of the room.) But
whatever you do, don’t read it!
For on-ce you have deciphered
those red hieroglyvphics, you are
in great danger of coming under
the spell of one of the mast vi-
cious and soul-destroying vam-
pires in the business—the Para-
ghaphicus Personalis Horendus,
or Theme-Reading Gremlin.

The TRG loves split inﬁnitives;
it thrives on comma splices; it
grows fat on dangling participles.
And there's nothing it likes bet-
ter than to scrawl “Spelling!”
across every other word on your
paper. With ﬁen-dish glee it seizes
upon non-sentences and colloqui-
alisms, and when ‘it sees an ab-
breviation, its little ink glands
begin to secrete faster than ever.
Once you are in the unscrupulous
clutches of this creature, you will
ﬁnd yourself meekly following the
rules for the use of the semicolon
in your Perrin, going out of your
way to include concrete details,
and actually (though this last
shameful degradation can be
avoided if you have strong will
power) organizing your theme be-
fore you start to write. '

And yet I suppose we should
not be too hard on the TRG, for

the poor creature has. no mother. '

It rises, like the Phoenix from the
ﬂames, out of a bottl-e of Water-
man’s permanent red, and is forc-
ed to battle the adversities of this
ungrammatical world wi-th neith-
er love nor guidance. Thus, al-
most before its delicate baby tal-
ons have hardened and its little
ink-sac begun to ﬁll, it is forced,
as any child psychologist can ex-
plain to you, into an attitude
which unhappily results in its
ripping out whole paragraphs and
deleting innumerable commas in

later life. The TRG’s unsupervised
childhood, with no one to tell it

‘to eat its spinach and not to speak

to strange men, creates other un-
fortunate situations and may lead
to traumatic, experiences which
continue to color its emotional
outlook for years to come. So re-
member, when your professor ex-
plains that the nasty “Recast!”s
and “Tense!”s in the margin of
your paper are there there be-
cause his TRG has «had another
attack of dyspepsia or is having
trouble with its love life, accept
his apology with equanimity.

Occasionally, however, the TRW
has a good day. Especially in the
spring, it succumbs to «the blan-
dishments of nattire, sticks a vi-
olet behind one ear, and pens
tender love lyrics in the margins:

“My corrections are red,

The instructor's are blue.

And if you don’t like them,

You know what you can do.”

Sometimes it even doodles. It
writes “lGoo-d!” instead of “Ugh!”
when you drool over the beauties
of Lake Kickipoo by moonlight;
and it may even feel so euphoric
that it will give you a B minus
minus instead of a C plus. Once
in a hundred years the long-suf-
fering TRG receives a notice that
its pay-check is waiting in the
treasurer’s oﬂice, an-d to celebrate
this happy moment it breaks
down and gives an A. Then. it
checks its unseemly mirth, goes
home, and reads seven‘ chapters
of Perrin and twenty-ﬁve pages
of the dictionary by way of atone-
rnent.

Beware, dear children, of the
TRG. From its insidious inﬂuence
one is immune. It is the terror
of all freshmen, the bane of soph-
omores and juniors, the ghost that
haunts seniors to the very doors
of Memorial hall. Still, when the
snow whirls outside and long
investigators are due, say a pray-
er for the TRG. It means well,
in its grisly way. And remember,
it has no mother.

Applications for graduation
on January 26 must be ﬁled in
the ofﬁce of the dean of the
School of Education before No-
vember 1.

Editor, The Pitt News: .

I am one of those so-called in-
dependent voters who has not yet
made up his mind on how to vote
in the coming election. We are
the ones who are supposed to have
the decision in our ballots. In
View of this there are a few ques-
tions I’d like to ask both sides,
questions concerning a phony issue

which has been blown way, way
up by hot air from both sides, a
process which can cause this na-
tion much harm. »

Democrats, do you seriously be-
lieve that Mr. Dewey is a Fascist
because some of the people who
are openly sympathetic to Fascism
are supporting him? Republicans,

do you draw the conclusion that

Mr. Roosevelt is a Communist be-
cause the members of that party
have come all out for him? Mr.
Dewey firmly repudiated the ac-
tivities of Ham Fish. Mr. Roose-
velt, with equal fervor, turned his
face away from Earl Browder. In
spite of this Fish continues to work
for a Republican victory and
Browder for a Democratic one.
Does this prove that both candi-
dates are insincere?

The worst sinners upon this
phony issue of Communism vs.

Fascism are the people on both"
sides typiﬁed by Mrs. Clare Booth '

Luce. (I use her name because
she is the most ﬂamboyant and
therefore the best known and most
typical.) Mrs. Luce, as are some
of her Democratic counterparts, is
a very able and clever person who
knows what the score is all right.
She knows very well that Mr.
Roosevelt :?and his administration
are no more Communist than Mr.
Dewey and his administration
would be Fascist.

cere and inﬂammatory. They are
demagoguery of the lowest type
and those responsible for‘ them are
beneath the contempt of the Am-
erican peiaple, Republicans and
Democrats. alike.

One ﬁnal question. Democrats,
are you so convinced of the dis-
astrous effects of a Dewey victory
that you would fight a civil war to
oust him? Republicans, if Roose-
velt should win again would you
spring to arms to save your coun-
try from ‘him? It would be the
duty of both of you to resort to
armed conflict if you so believed.

Such is the real test of this
phony issue. Do not forget that it
tends to civil war and. to blood-
shed. Let us not play the game of
either of the extremist groups.
Remember that the Reichstag fire
of 1934 was a phony issue, too, and
it brought Hitler into power.

Dewey a Eascist. Rubbish!
Roosevelt a Communist. Nonsense!

In planning the year’s program,
President Jean Swope, Ed, has
attempted “to provi-de activities of
interest for every woman at the
University.” Included in the plans
for the year are the Monday
luncheon club discussions, knit-
ting for -the ‘Red Cross, bowling
parties and the popular YM-YW
association nights, forums and
symposia on current social and
economic problems, Pitkin club
dinners, folk dancing, and “just
plain fun.” ‘

Women who would like to‘ join
are asked to see Jean Swope or
come up to the YW office at 2816
Cathedral. Some one will always
be at the oﬁice to give out mem-
bership forms and collect dues.
So, as Director Batz says, “Now’s
the time to re—new old friendships
and ﬁnd some new ones.”

  
 
  
 
  

Groups Participate

In Services

On Tuesday, October 17, Dr.
William R. Farmer discussed with
representatives of all men’s and
women’s fraternities the back-
ground and possibilities of student
leadership in the Friday chapel
services. Letters had been sent
out early in September inviting
these organized groups to partici-
pate as worshippers and leaders in
the weekly programs. Due to the
favorable response, fraternities
will be collectively responsible for
the entire fraternity series which
will last through the ﬁrst semester.

The following fraternities will

participate on these Fridays:
October 27, Phi Mu; November 3,

' Sigma Chi; November 10, Delta

Delta Delta; November 17, Phi
Gamma Delta; December 1, Delta
Zeta; December 8, Pi Lambda Phi;
December 15, Kappa Kappa Gam-
ma; January 5, Delta Sigma Phi;
and January 12, Phi Epsilon Pi.
With this campus interest attain-
ed, the committee plans, prior to
the spring term, to invite all cam-
pus activities and organizations
and all interested individual stu-
dents, as well as the remaining
fraternities, to volunteer for lead-
ership and to increase the awak-
ened interest in the Friday service.

This week Shirley Cullingford,
representing Phi Mu, will be stu-
dent leader at 1 o’clock. Dr. Far-
mer will talk on the Chapel Win-
dows, and the Heinz Chapel choir
will sing “How Lovely Is Thy
Dwelling Place” by Johannes
Brahms.

Now that Rush week is over the
fraternity men are speaking to one
another again-—in pleasant tones.
It was fun while it lasted, but I
don’t.think anyone regrets that it
is over. And since peace and quiet
have come back to the campus,
we'll just review the highlights of
those three days.

On Friday evening the Delts
had a house full of rushees watch-
ing a magician who put on quite
.an act for the boys. In addition to
the magician, the Delts had sound
movies at the house.

‘Also in the realm of the mys-
terious, the Pi Lams had a hyp-
notist at their house. He provided
an amusing evening for everyone
with his act.

At their house dance on Saturday
evening, the Phi Delts had white
Carnations as decorations. The
ﬂowers were all over the house,

and it made a very beautiful ap-
pearance.

The Phi Eps spent Friday even-
ing at the Warner Brothers private
showing room, where they saw a
sneak preview of a new motion
picture. After the movie, the boys
went to the Variety club.

The SAEs had a dinner dance for
their Saturday night program. The

ebrothers and rushees with their

dates had dinner and spent the
evening dancing.

On Thursday evening the PiKAs
had a sports night at their house.
Guests were Harry Keck, Chilly
Doyle, Stan Musial of the St.
Louis Cardinals, Jim Russel of the
Pirates, Al Lopez, also of the Pi-
rates, Hornet coach Max Kamin-
sky with four of his stars, and
former Pirate catcher George
Susce.

The Sigma Chis really outdid
themselves at their dance on Sat-
urday night in the Hotel Henry.
The highlight of the evening was a
huge cake, baked in the shape of
the Sig’s pin. The cake looked so
good, the boys hated to eat it.

The next big event on the social
calendar for fraternity men and
independents as well is the Off the
Record‘ hall. We hope to see
everyone there.

All College students wishing
to graduate January 26, 1945,
should have their applications
for graduation in the College
Office before November 1, 1944.

THE PITT NEWS

Souvenirs Sent

By Pitt Men

It's a little early for trips to
the library to bone for majors
but there’s an interesting collec-
tion up on the ﬁfth floor in the
reference room right now that
would make an extra trip worth
while. It's the exhibition of Ger-
man souvenirs that you read
about in the News a few weeks
ago. If you «have never been near-
er than a newreel to a German
uniform or riﬂe, you’ll want to
see the insignias, riﬂes, and in-
struments that have been sent
from all over the world by for-
mer Pitt men now in the service.
These souvenirs are being dis-
played by Dr. Robinson, head of
the library.

Dr. Hooker, head of the anat-
omy department a-t medical school
has contributed a group of medi-
cal tags which are much more
elaborate and complicated than
the types used by our medics.
They are labeled so that a doctor
can tell at a glance exactly what
is wrong with a patient. The tags
are colored differently for wound-
ed, sick, and injured by military
material. R These tags are tied on
the soldiers, giving details of ear-
ly treatment provided. A very
clever idea is the perforated sides
on the tags, which, if left as they
are, indicate that the man is so
injured that he must not be mov-
ed. Presence of yellow stripes in-
dicate that a man has an infec-
tious disease, but can be trans-
ported. This system is ‘not only
convenient for separating patients,
but prevents soldiers with slight
injuries from “goldbricking.”

There are some examples of the
types of money that the Germans
to-ok with them
countries. Also some sample leaf-
lets dropped by the Germans on
the occupied countries either to
educate the people to -the German
doctrine or to convince them that
resistance is useless.

Ho! Rush week is over and
things are again back to normal.
Those strained expressions have
disappeared from the faces of
both rushers and rushees—at least
the men. Monday looked like
gloomy Sunday about the Tuck
shops for some people.

Forever on the beam are the
dents. Especially Jim Reber, who’s
in on the ground floor with Jo Ann
McGhee. We’ve seen her and are
well pleased with what we’ve seen.
Speaking of meds, which we
weren't, but gee whiz fellas we’ve
got to transish somehow. To get
back t-o the subject we’ll be hav-
ing a lot of news from up on the
hill soon. There’s a very compe-
tent Sp)’ ‘up there now———name of
Ed (Mata Hari) Lauth——who, in
his undergrad days at Pitt, used
to spout off in Pittpourri once a
week, also.

Jean Wyckoff and “Red” Mc-
Cormick were together Saturday
evening at you-know-where.
Didn’t catch the name ourselves.
Also Sally Bair and Bob Covey.

Another pinning, this time from
the Tech Delt house, involved
Alice Krepps. We don’t know the
guy’s name, which just goes to
show how inefficient we are. Ask
Alice.

News Reporter Goes Insane

Deciphering Meaning of Tuck

Curiosity can be terrible! One little question can create havoc!
For instance, there was the reporter who wanted to know what the
“Tuck” in Tuck shop means. She had to know. She couldn’t sleep
nights until she knew.

The hot hunt for information began, of all places, at the dental
infirmary building, where said reporter was to find Mrs. Alice Wilker,
manager of the University cafeteria. She cornered her quarry, elbow-
deep in fruit salad so that the poor woman couldn’t escape and plied

her with questions.

Mrs. Wilker emerged from the
fruit salad and took the reporter
to her oﬂlce where she explained
that the name “Tuck shop” was
English in origin.

The Pitt News hound battered
down the hatches and set her
course for the Cathedral this time.
Here, she got the story straight
from Miss Helen Pool Rush, dean
of women. It was decided that
because the Cathedral is English
Gothic in architecture, the student
eating places should be given an
English name and someone or
other, probably Miss Thyrsa Amos,
former dean of women, had sug-
gested the British name of Tuck
shops.

Then the next port of call was

avg.

     

the 25th ﬂoor. From Mr. John
Weber, information was gleaned
that the Tuck shops are named

for the student ﬁsh-and-chips es-
tablishments at Hart house, the
student union at the University of
Toronto, in Canada. The name is
still English in origin, however.
Anyway, in the dim, mythical past
of the University, the students be-
gan calling the ground ﬂoor re-
fuelling stations Tuck shops. Cor-
rection please: at ﬁrst Tuck shop
was singular, the original ances-
tor, Tuck shop 1, located where
the present book store is en-
camped. Tuck shop 2, the red
room, came into being, was soon
outgrown, and Tuck shop 3, the
blue room was created.

Military Fraternity
Installs Officers

Pitt Riﬂes, honorary military
science fraternity, will begin their
fall program with the oiﬁcial in-
stallation of officers, Friday, Oc-
tober 27. Richard O. Hargrave, E,
will serve as the new captain and
commanding officer for the unit
during the coming year while An-
son Boothe, E, 1st. Lieutenant,
will be installed as Adjutant.

The work for the coming year,
as outlined by Hargraave, will be
centered around developing a pro-
gram for the many new members
of the organization, many of whom
have had little or no previous mil-
itary training. Any student regis-
tered in military science is eligi-
ble for membership. There will be
a special meeting for all those stu-
dents interested in Pitt Riﬂes
Tuesday, October 31.

The tentative plans for the year
will include instruction in regu-
lar infantry drill, special drills
with the riﬂe, and practice in
commanding a platoon. Later in
the winter, when the weather pro-
hibits outside drill, a. special pro-
gram of training ﬁlms and army
war films will be featured.

World Student Service Fund
Sets High Campaign Goal

A goal of $500,000 has been set for the 1944-45 campaign of the
World Student Service fund. The fund's New York office reports,
“Never have we faced such needs. Our relief committees overseas
could spend ten times as much as we can supply.” Recent news cables
from the Chungking China front are serious. Continuing advances of
Japanese armies in southwest China are destroying universities which
had already migrated four or ﬁve times. One eye witness account
says: “At midnight the Japanese came when we were all asleep. In

the light of their torches they¢

looked ﬁerce and terrible. Our
guide, Mr. Chen, asked why they
had come. This angered them so
that they brutally stabbed him to
death. None of us dared to say a
word. Then those robbers began
to open all our trunks and took
away the things which they liked.
After their departure there was
much confusion, mourning for the
innocent dead, crying over lost
property, hatred, revenge, fear all
mingled together.”

From Europe comes news of the
beginnings of the post—war pro-
gram as the ﬁrst student services
are initiated in liberated countries.
A cable just received in the W. S.
S. F. office tells of two staff mem-
bers already in France, opening a
rehabilitation home for 100 French
students in the Savoie mountains.
A representative of the French
student resistance movement is
already working in the Geneva
oﬂice. Plans are being made for
the ﬁrst student relief workers
from overseas to go to Europe.

The program among prisoners of
war keeps its primary place in the
European student relief program.
Despite disrupted communications
in Germany, thousands of books
go each month from Geneva to in-
dividual prisoners. This work
must continue long after V—E day,

for the repatriation process will be

The W.S.S.F. reports that its
aid to American students of Japa-
nese ancestry continues, with the
work soon to enter its third year.

President Meta Glass of Sweet
Briar college, president of the
World Student Service fund says:
“There is no doubt that American
students can raise $500,000 for the
relief of their fellow students Who
are victims of war. They can
raise more than that if they set
their minds to it.”

Poem of the Week . . .
“Any girl can be gay in a nice
coupe,
In a taxi they all can be jolly,
But the girl worth while
Is the one who can smile,

When you take her home in a
trolley.”

After ploughing that one under
let’s discuss some
Disc Releases . . .

This week I’d like to review and
recommend a few albums to you
platter ﬁends. First is an excep-
tionally ﬁne album, Capitol’s “New
American Jazz.” The sides in-
clude, “Clambake in B-Flat”, “In
my Solitude”, “Cassanova’s La-
ment”, “Ain’t Goin’ No Place”, and
a few other topnotch jazz num-
bers. Some of the great jazz
artists that stand out in this col-
lection are Jack Teagarden, Billy
May, Zutty Singleton and Shortyl
Cherock. Vocals are covered by
Mr. T. and Peggy Lee.

Another recent release is “Bing
Crosby, Vol. II,” a collection of
some of his early recordings for
Brunswick. Among the impres-
sions, you’ll ﬁnd, “Where the Blue
of the Night”, “Star Dust”, “Danc-
ing in the Dark”, and “Sweet and
Lovely.” Together with these
comes a folder which repeats the
biographical notes from Vol. I and
includes comments on each record
in Vol. II.

“Frankie Carle and His Girl
Friends,” is the title of Carle’s
newest album. You’ll want to hear
the king of the ivories on “Ida”,
“Liza”, “Rose Marie”, “Margie”,
and “Louise.”

Oil up my scooter and we’ll dash
downtown and see who’s
On Stage . . .

This week, Cab Calloway. Yes,
Cats, Mr. “Hi-dee-hi-dee-ho” him-
self. Incidentally, if you want to
sizzle with the latest jive, get
Cab’s “Hepster Dictionary.” You
can get yourself a copy by writ-
ing to C. C. at 1619 Broadway,
New York City, enclosing return
postage.

New Graduate Assistant

Mr. Richard G. Ralisy, former
head of business administration at
State Teachers college of Farms-
ville, Virginia, assumed the posi-
tion of graduate assistant in com-
mercial education this term. He
is Working for the requirements

for his Ph.D. degree.

Veterans Enroll
In Short-Term
Basic Courses

Short-term courses in basic
subjects for veterans who wish to
enter Pitt during a semester have
been arranged by Stanton C.
Crawford, dean of the College,
and Dean of Men Theodore W.
Biddle.

Two short terms are planned
for this semester. The ﬁrst will
begin on November 20, and ex-
tend one month; the second will
begin on January 2 and end with
the regular fall semester. The sec-
ond group of short terms will be
offered during the spring semester,
with the ﬁrst one beginning on
March 15.

‘The purpose of these courses is
to enable service.men discharged
at almost any time during the
winter and -spring to enter school
as soon as they wish, rather than
at only fall, spring, and summer
registrations. The work in these
basic courses is identical with
that given in the regular term, and
in its concentrated form is offered
by the same teachers.

Information concerning any of
these short-term courses is avail-
able at the offices of the deans of
the various schools, and at the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men.

In addition to announcing these
new courses for veterans, the dean
of men’s ofﬁce has issued ﬁgures
of veterans enrollment at the Uni-
versity. As of October 18, 114 dis-
charged men were enrolled in the
College, School of Engineering, and
Mines, Business Administration,
and Education; four in the School
of Pharmacy; six at the Johns-
town center; 33 -in the School of
Medicine; 65 in the School of
Dentistry; 2 in the School of
Nursing; one in Law school; four
in the School of Applied Social
Scierces; and 48 as afternoon,
evening, and graduate students.
The total number of veterans now
at Pitt is 277. However, this. num-
ber is only as accurate as the
dean of men’s ﬁles, which accord-
ing t-o ‘Mr. Biddle, are not fully
complete.

Mr. Robert L. Arthur, assistant
to the dean of men, who has re-
cently been discharged from ac-
tive service, will assume charge
of the -school’s veteran program
and of the special short-term
courses’.

THE PITT ‘ NEWS

ﬂamaél

News of Pitt men in service
comes to us this week from the
ﬁghting forces “over there.”

We hear that former Pitt News
staff member, Bill McElwain is

in North Eastern France on the
staff of Stars and Stripes; while
Bill was in Africa, he met both
Lt. Mike DeMarco and Lt. Sully
Loeb in Algiers and had a won-
derful time talking over old times.
In Rome, Bill happened to look
up from «his typewriter -to see Lt.
Al Bush standing there. Al was
coaching a track team from Cor-
sica for the Allied championship
in Rome. Bill writes, “Of all the
places I have seen over here—
Casablanca. Oran, Tunis, Bizerte,
Sidi Bel Abbes, Naples, Rome,
and my present location, Gren-
oble rates number one. The peo-
ple were wonderful, and we have
nothing in America to match the
sidewalk cafe. Grenoble seems to
be a sort of refuge center, and
there were Czechs, Poles, Ger-
mans, Italians, Russians, and of
course dozens of people from
north France.” Bill is convinced
that you don’t learn a language
until you date a girl who knows
no English. ‘ “It’s certainly more
fun that way.” Incidentally, Mike
DeMarco is now in France, too.

From Capt. Irving Bennett
comes word that he is now sta-
tioned in New Guinea. He says,
“I work pretty hard, but that
passes the time well, and I still
meet Pittites everywhere. When

goes on to say, “Would I trade
this tropic isle with its beautiful
days, its soft nights, its verdant
hills and cooling beaches for
Pittsburgh? Boy, would I!”

Lt. Arnie Bree visited Rome on
a three day pass recently. Arnie’s
comment is: “Have seen all the
important places and ﬁnd Rome
quite interesting. Met Dave Op-
penheim, a P1 Lam, here in the
oﬁicers’ club.” Needless to say

they were both pleasantly sur-
prised. '

Lt. Sherman Jubalierer writes
from Belgium, his present station:
“Censorship prohibits my telling
you some memorable experiences
in France. Oo la la! . This

country is very picturesque. The
people speak a mixture of Ger-
man and French. Unfortunately,
I can’t speak German, but I have
a G.I. German book and two good
hands.”

By Moe Spiegel, Sports Editor

After the Chatham game this Saturday, the Panthers are in for
unusual surroundings. The team has an open date the following Sat-
urday and_ then they hit the road to play Ohio State at Columbus and
Indiana at Bloomington. Many things will be strange to the Pitt
squad. It will probably be queer to be playing before large croiwds
again. Only 10,000 turned out last Saturday to see the locals play an
Illinois team that is well on its way to breaking all rushing records.
And though Pitt lost, there were few people present who did not
enjoy the game for the sport itself. Coach Shaughnessy and his men
will also heancheers on these foreign gridirons. There were times
during the Illinois game when the only noise in the huge stadium was
The cheerleaders
did a futile job trying to get some rooting out of the assembled stu-
dents. If the time ever arrives when the Pitt eleven will prefer to
play away from home, it will be no puzzle. No one will be to blame
except the so-called football “fans” of Pittsburgh.
No Pushover, Bub

Pitt is supposed to have a setup this week when the Chatham
army team comes to town. This is the word of the “experts” around
town. But don’t believe it or you may be in for a big surprise. The
Blockbusters are a group of veteran footballers and will have an edge
in both ageand experience over the Panthers. It is true that they

, have been swamped by other service elevens, but the teams that

conquered them were loaded down with All-Americans like Marshall
Goldberg and Bill Daley, to mention but two of many. It is no dis-
grace to lose to a good team and the Army ﬂiers, plus the Panthers,
have met some of the top teams in the nation. So, the Jungle Cats
are in for no easy time on Saturday. Coach Shaughnessy has an in-
jured list a mile long and the patched up team he puts on the ﬁeld
Hey

, A Man's World, eh?

When any female entered a newspaper oiﬁce before the war, she
would be greeted with a loud, rasping “Who left the door open? Get
that dame out of here.” But, if you take the word of Hugh Wagnon,
general manager of Associated Press’s bureau “PX” in Philadelphia,
this is all changed. ' His statement these days as to the importance of
women is “What—in the present emergency—would we do without
the ladies?” '

That’s where Elaine Kahn, ex-sports editor of the Pitt News, enters
Elaine is only one of several members of her sex who is
holding down an important position in the AP’s Pittsburgh bureau.
Miss Kahn has retained that livewire technique which became so
familiar around the News ofﬁce, and is using these tactics to the best
advantage of the AP. Although her specialty is writing sports from a
woman's angle, she does general reportorial work just as well. We

men have nothing left, not even sports.

WHAT’S WRONG WITH PITT?
—Why doesn’t the student body
support its football team? Oh,
pardon us! There deﬁnitely are
some students that turn out reg-
ularly to watch the team perform,
but do they also help cheer the
team on?

No matter what the score may
be, our boys are out there on the
ﬁeld, ﬁghting every minute. Do
we back them up by cheering
them on? Do we keep their spirits
up, even though a powerful team
is steam-rolling its way to the goal
line?

It’s not that the cheerleaders are
not chock full of spirit. But they
can’t carry the burden by them-
selves. Their only function is to
lead the student body in organized
cheering. .

VVhy then, if organized cheering
is so essential to the morale . of
the team—why—-is there a con-
tinued attempt by one section,
and particularly one fraternity, to
disrupt, and dis-unify the efforts
of our cheerleaders?

It is not that this section malici-
ously attempts to disrupt order. It
is just that in their own way, not
realizing the results of their lack
of cooperation, these boys satire

the entire effort of the cheering
section.

The psychological atmosphere
that is formed by organized root-
ing is one factor that goes a long
way towards making what is com-
monly called SCHOOL SPIRIT.

Let’s not allow the other schools
that we play say that Pitt lacks
spirit. Let’s go out Saturday and
no matter what the score, show
our team that ,we are backing
them to the hilt.

The Phi Ep-Phi Gam game
was postponed until tomorrow.
The other contests on the inter-
fraternity schedule will remain
as slated unless they are of-
ﬁcially postponed.

Cage Phantoms
Conditioning

For three weeks the Panther
basketball “Phantoms” have been
drilling, trying to perfect their
dribbling, passing and shooting.
Inside sources claim that Pitt “has
something” this year. Whether
this be the case or not, Dr; Carl-
son knows that success can be
accomplished only by hard work.
If the Panthers do have an out-
standing ﬂoor squad, the court
fans will see a team =that «has been
perfectly conditioned. Some quin-
tets do not live up to expectations
because «of faulty training, but
only the rigors of a long season
can reveal faults. However, hard
work won’t hurt, that’s certain.

Several dozen players have
been practicing "three times a
week learning the Carlson sys-
tem of offense. The cage mentor
is still on the lookout for more
players and anyone who desires
to tryout for the team is urged to
report to Dr. Carlson as soon as
possible.

Age, Experience
Favor Soldiers

With almost as many players on
the injured list as. are ready for
action, the Panthers play host to a
group of Blockbusters from the
Chatham Army air base. Since the

contest this Saturday is scheduled
for -the stadium gridiron, the sol-
diers have a long journey to make,
Chatham ﬁeld being close to Sa-
vannah, Georgia. The air base is
a unit of the First air force used
to train crews for the large B 24
Liberator bombers. The -soldier
football team is composed of for-
mer high. school and college play-
ers normally assigned to Chatham
ﬁeld. They carry out regular as-
signments as members of the static
personnel. Football, in no Way
relieves the men from military re-
sponsiblity and football therefore
amounts to extra duty.

Play Tough Teams

Known as the Blockbusters, the
army eleven has played a gruel-
ling ‘schedule to- d-ate. The team
beat Newberry college, a speedy
eleven made up of V 12 students,
12-7, and_ held the powerful
Fourth Infantry Raiders to a
scoreless tie at Ft. Benning. At
the close of a week in which they
appeared on the gridiron three
times in seven days, the Block-
busters went down before the
mighty Third Air Force Grem-
lins. The -Gremlins, by the way,
had 12 All-Americans in their
lineup. The Chatham squad was
also handily defeated by the Nav-
al Amphibious training school
eleven at Ft. Pierce, Florida.
Among the All-Americans on the
Amphibious team were Marshall
Goldberg, former Pitt star and
Bill Daley, a gridir-on standout at
Minnesota and Michigan.

Players Experienced

Lt. “Tarzan” White, All-Amer-
ican guard from Alabama who is
coaching the Blockbusters and
playing ful.lback, will probably
start S/sgt. Billy Probst, a Teran,
and Lt. “Pop” Burt of San Jose
college at tackles. Sgt. Probst has
had no college football experience
but he has made his 205 poun5ds
count in the Chatham line. The
starting ends will be Pfc. Stanley
Bondelevitch who played for St.
Anslems, and :Sgt. J immie ‘Moran,
formerly with Fordham. At guard
will be Pfc. Willie Walker of
Manhattan college, and Lt. Billy
Foster. Lt. Foster is .a bombard-
ier on a B-24 an-d has earned the
Distinguished Flying ‘Cross -and
the Air Medal, both with three
clusters. Lt. Bill Donaldson, at
center, formerly played for Ala-
bama.

In the backﬁeld will be AS-/sgt.
Bill Guice at quarterback, Lt.
Donald Weeks and Lt. Bob Hun-
ter at the halfback posts, and Lt.
“Tarzan” White, the coach, at full-
back. ’

Faculty Members
Speak at Deshon

A program -of talks by promi-
nent Pitt faculty members for
convalescent men at the Deshon
general hospital will be part of
a new army orientation program,
Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle

announced last week. The pur-
pose of these talks is to assist men
about to be returned to civilian
life in making their rehabilita-
tion as easy as possible.

Dr. John J. Geise, professor of

history, began this series of talks.

when he spoke last Wednesday
on “Nationalisms and Their Rela-
tionship to the Peace.” Today Dr.
J. Warren Nystrom, assistant pro-
fessor of geography, will speak on
“World Geography.”

The University will continue to
supply speakers for this series of
Wednesday discussions for the re-
mainder of this particular army
rehabilitation program, the dura-
tion of which has not been de-
cided.

Mr. Biddle is charged with ar-
ranging the program for the Uni-
versity.
