Officials plan Pitt priorities

By Lisa B. Keer
Senior Editor

Approximately 150 Pitt adminis-
trators, faculty and staff members
discussed several problems central
to the university’s future at the Con-
ference on Planning Priorities held
at Pitt’s Johnstown campus last
Wednesday through Friday.

The conference — to which no
students were invited — was
intended to provide members of the
Pitt community with an opportunity
to discuss potential policy avenues
and other issues of concern to them.
In particular, the conference focused
on five specific topics: black stu-

-dents, female students, academic
‘priorities, research and academic
and administrative computing.
‘Jack Daniel, the new assistant
provost for undergraduate pro_-
grams, addressed certain key areas
of concern fdr black students.

“The health’ sciences, the applied
sciences, and the natural sciences in
the arts and sciences, I view as three
priority areds for black students."

Daniel stressed the cumulative
nature of mathematics and its basic
role in scientific disciplines as a
problem for the black student.

“Given that mathematics is an

(intellectual gatekeeper, if you go 8

’,back to maybe as early as seventh
grade, if the student is on the wrong
track-at that time, that student is not

able to pursue the applied sciences at
the college level,” he said. “There-
fore, if we are to impact the applied
sciences, we cannot wait until they
are freshmen in college. We must go
back and develop pre-college
programs.”

Daniel has yet to formalize his
ideas on apolicy level, but said he is
certain that pre-college programs
would be instrumental in developing
black students. These programs, if
implemented, will probably be
aimed at,l0th- through l2th-grade
students, although Daniel believes
the eighth grade would be an’ ideal
starting point. He added, however,
“We don’t have the resources to do
 that." .

Much of what was discussed at the
Johnstown conference concerned
students, although student leaders
were not present at this gathering.

“As far as I know, students have
never been on the invitation list,”
said Sam Deep of the office of the
provost. ‘‘I made the final decision
as to who would or would not be
added to the list. We used a list from
last year’s conference to create the
list,” he explained.

“There was no special reason for .

why we didn’t invite students, and
maybe a case could be made  There
would probably be a pretty good
argument for including a student in
each discussion group.”The trouble,
he said, is that a single student might
be unrepresentative, and including

one might distort the discussion ifhe
or she were not an expert on the
topic.

If the university had invited se-
veral students tojoin each group, the
conference could have become “an
administrative nightmare." Deep
added.

Female students face nightmares
of other types, according to Mari-
gold Edwards of the health, physical
education and recreational educa-
tion department.

Edwards addressed the needs of
the “multiple role” woman. These
women usually attend the university
on a part-time basis, often juggling
school with a job and family
responsibilities.

Edwards would like to “ease the
burden" on these women. She favors
a model day care center on‘ campus.
“We shouldn’t settle for anything
less than the best,” she said.

. Edwards added that the facility.

could also serve as a clinical training
ground.

Provost Roger Benjamin antici-
pated that important academic deci-
sions with budgetary ramifications
would be reached in late December,

with all schools and departments, as .

well as the university’s administra-
tive offices, participating.

Benjamin anticipated that the
conference would have long-range
implications for the university. \

Holzman joins Academy

Industrial Engineering Department Chairman Albert C. Holzman
is the first industrial engineer to be elected a ‘member of the National
Academy of Engineering in the 30-year history of the Academy.

Holzman joined the Pitt faculty in I951, following his work as an
industrial analyst for Bethlehm Steel Corp. He was appointed chair-
man of the department in I965 and has written numberous
publications. » _

Election to the academy is considered the highest professional

distinction an engineer can receive. and it honors those who have '
“ made important contributions to engineering theory and practice.

English prof wins award

Glynda Hull, who received her doctorate in English composition
from Pitt in August 1983, has written what wasjudged to bethe finest
dissertation related to education in the past year.

Hull, of Louisville, Miss.. is the recipient of the 1984 Americn
Educational Resesarch Association Outstanding Dissertation Award
for “The Editing Process in Writing: A Performance Study of Experts
and Novices.“

V The dissertation examined how writers detect and correct errors in
syntax, usage, punctuation and mechanics in written texts, and Hull

found there isia serious mismatch between the way inexperienced

writers locate and correct errors and the way teachers and grammar
books have taught them to do so.

Pitt surgeon wins award

Oscar Ramirez, a plastic surgery resident at Pitt, has been awarded
the second prize in the annual Educational Foundation ofthe Ameri-
can Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons competition.

The‘ society administers the highest competitive award in plastic
surgery\research. The award will entitle Ramirez to visit other plastic

Letter to the Editor

Mobilization for Animals
denies ‘crackpot’ charges

Although we are in complete

agreement with the view ofthe medi- “

cal community at the University of
Pittsburgh offered by James Crary
in his column “Study nutrition, not
vivisection“ (The Pitt News, May
23), we do take issue with two of his
remarks.

Mr. Crary referred to the Mobili-
zation for Animals as a “crackpot"
organization. Although we’ll excuse
his poor grammar (nouns cannot
modify nouns), we find it difficult to
dismiss the derogatory reference.
Mobilization for Animals is a coali-
tion of over 450 animal rights organ-
izations which have joined one
another to demonstrate their oppo-
sition to institutionalized animal
abuse.

In 1983, the mobilization held the
largest demonstrations ever held for
animals at its Primate Centers
actions. This year, it sponsored the
largest rallies for wildlife in the his-
tory of the anti-trapping movement
and plans to stage a massive, inter-
national mobilization at the annual
convention of the American Psycho-
logical Association in Toronto,
Canada on August 24, 25 and 26.

Locally, individuals and organi-
zations from the Pittsburgh area
demonstrated with a funeral proces-
sion through Oakland which ended
in a vigil at Scaife Hall on April 24,
World Day for Laboratory
Animals.

Participants in Mobilization for
Animals at the local and national
level,represent every social and eco-
nomic group. They are not the
“medically trained scholars” whom
Mr. Crary would prefer to be at the
of an anti-vivisection
movement, but thev are aware, con-

cerned, involved and dedicated to
take whatever steps are necessary to
eliminate the daily pain and suffer-
ing that occurs within research
facilities.

It is unfortunate, but Mr. Crary
seems to be writing in an historical
vacuum. Rights for women, for
minorities and, indeed, for students
were not easily obtained from some
benevolent power structure — they
were wrested from authority follow-
ing acts of protest which generated
the public and political pressure
necessary to effect change. A similar
situation exists in the medical
research establishment with its
myopic dependence upon the animal
model, as illustrated by Mr. Crary.

To expect some groundswell of
support for alternatives to vivisec-
tion from such a group is unrealistic.
Laws prohibiting vivisection
because it is morally wrong will be
enacted as the result of social and
political pressure exerted by anti-
vivisectionists such as the educators,
secretaries, laborers, social workers,
hospital staff members, engineers,
librarians and students who demon-
strated at Pitt on April 24.

We have invited Mr. Crary to join
us at our next meeting, on June 10 at
I230 p.m. at the Hill House, 1835

Centre Ave. We would like to extend ‘

that invitation to any interested stu-
dent or faculty member.

Before the dawn/Adam Eisenstat

Pitt degree factory: obsolete

When tradition becomes a malig-
nancy, as it has in today‘s American
colleges, it’s time for a cha nge. Large
universities such as Pitt, for all their
resources and facilities, have failed
abysmally to keep up with the times
as far as divergent fields of study like
the humanities and social sciences
are concerned.

A student just entering college in
the hopes of acquiring a broad and
interesting liberal education often
finds himself confronted with a mere
continuation. of his high school
classes, complete with the tedium
and blandness inherent in such a tra-
ditional format.

The curricula: in" most liberal arts
departments follow the same format
and contain the same material year
in and year out. Whether this is
because of indolence or reactionary
inclinations on the part of faculty
and administration, I don’t know.

In any case, students are being
denied-an optimal education. There
is little doubt that today’s college
students and graduates are far less
well read and conversant in litera-
ture, art, history and so forth than
their counterparts of 20 or 30 years
ago; This is because, among other
reasons, conventionalcollege classes
follow the same format as they did
30, 40 and even 80 years ago. Conse-

method of teaching and content, has
not kept up with the times and is
outmoded.

Although there may be a lack of
courses dealing with modern art and
thought, this is not the main prob-
lem. The cultural heritage ofthe past
is definitely worth studying, but it‘
only remains so if its links with the
present are emphasized and
analyzed.

Part of the blame for the deca-
dence and irrelevance of so much of
education lies with the complacent,
well-entrenched academics who per-
vade America’s colleges. So many of
these “educators” use tests, grades
and papers as ends and not as
means, as they should be considered.
This requires less work, less creativ-
ity and no vision whatsoever. Their
classes are exercises in predictability.
and academic drudgery.

The major flaw in the conven-
tional approach to education is its
utter failure to acknowledge the u-
nique and diverse experiences each
stuucnt brings witn mm to the class-
room. Uniform imposition of an
unfamiliar curriculum, as aggres-
sively practiced at places like Pitt, is
amazingly stifling and mundane,
usually to the point of discouraging
further desire to learn.

poor or mediocre one. His curricu-
lum can never be set —— rehashed
year after year —.— because he knows
with his heart that the experiences of
the present, as well as those of the
past, are not rigid and cannot be
adequately taught as such. This
method fosters in the students the
desire, and hopefully the ability, to
make connections between the pres-
ent and the past, between his own
experiences and those of others. For
students of such a teacher, the class
doesn’t end with the final exam; it
goes on for a lifetime.

Just as ignorance, poverty and
intolerance are obstacles to social
progress, so are rigidity, compla-
cency and stubborn "convention to
educational progress. For the time
and money that people invest in
school today, they have a right not
to be cheated on both counts. But
there will be no revolution in the
classroom, not in this generation, at
least. There will be no caucus of
teachers and administrators calling
for an end to passive, outdated
learning.

Students, even if only a few, can I
recognize the impoverished quality '
of their education and can go

beyond the classroom to change and
improve it. Think of it as intellectual
salvage in the scrapyard of the
degree factory.

From the foul line/Mark A. Sindler

U.S. pays forCarter’s Olympian blunder

The Russians are not coming.
indeed. the Soviet Union and l2
eastern bloc satellites have opted to
bypass the XXIII Olympiad in Los
Angeles. From the  Olympic
Training Center in Colorado
Springs to Jacksonville. Fla.. where
the U.S. gymnastics trials were held
last weekend. amateurs everywhere
are brooding over a second blow to
the Summer Games in four years.
Their reasons are easily justified.
When former President Jimmy Car-
ter took center stage in l980 by
announcing this nation’s boycott for
the U.S.S.R.’s failure to vacate
Afghanistan, the Games‘ U.S. par-
ticipants didn’t quite know how to
interpret the White House decision.
Some accepted the mandate as
any U.S. soldier would before going
to war: Do not second-question the
decision, just defend your country

and the actions it deems most
worthy.
Others did not take Carter’s

announcement lying down. Oppo-
nents despised the intrusion of for-
eign policy »»»» -» or of political
haranguitig. for that matter 7 in
sport's only truly international
festival.

The athletesistaunchly believed no
one except themselves could under-
stand the training, the discipline and

the commitment that went into pre-
paring for a two-week sports extra-
vaganza that surfaces once every
four years.

Then. to satisfy the whims of a
chiefexecutive. everything was blot-
ted out. One man decided for
hundreds of ‘athletes that their
dreams of gold. silver or bronze
would have to wait yet another four
years for fulfillment. Grief and frus-
tration replaced American medal
dreams.

Much the same can be said ofthe
Moscow Olympic Organizing Com-
mittee in a nation not known toitake

lightly the political actions of
another superpower.
America's or. more to the

point, Carter’s  decision to boy-
cott Moscow caused the Soviets
international embarassment.

ln the world's center of commu-
nism. where the Politburo had
hoped to showcase Red Square and
what it stands for to millions in
attendance and viewing on TV. the
U.S. tainted the proceedings dra-
matically. The Yanks even dragged
many of their Western allies out of
Moscow.

So why all the fuss when Moscow
announced ~~ in direct replication of
Carter circa i980 - its L.A. boy-
cott? References to CIA-backed ter-

rorist activity. anti-Soviet hysteria
(including a Ban the Soviets Coali-
tion). unsafe conditions for athletes
and revoking a Soviet diplomat‘s
visa because of suspected KGB ties
were all pushed to the front.

The bottom line. inevitably. was
revenge. Zlhe only question remain-
ing is why the USSR waited so long
to take it.

Truthfully, it would have been
stupid for the Soviets not to boycott
Los Angeles. Konstantin U. Cher-
n nko. his predecessors and his
present—day comrades are as well
known for their eye-for-an-eye.
tooth-for-a—tooth ideals as ABC-TV
is for its five interlocking rings.

Nobody baits the Russian bear
without paying the price.

The Soviets continually. and
maybe increasingly. give precedence
to their athletes. Funding. world-
wide travel. pampering and expert
guidance come the way of athletes
not only in the U.S.S.R. but in other
bloc nations. too. Their successes in
international competition. the
record reveals. bode well for sustain-
ing and furthering communist objec-

tives. Their successful athletic
exploits nearly legitimize those
objectives. ‘

Surely Soviet and other commu-
nist athletes fretted over Moscow’s

athletes did tour years ago or are
presently You see a special feeling
overcomes the athlete who defeats
or betters it Soviet athlete. That
emotional and physical high has
been preserved ever since the Cold
War‘s inception. Animosity dies
hard.

So the United States is now pay-
ing for the ineptitude of a former
president. No amateur athlete any-
where ciimes :iwa_\ better from it.
Contrary to present indications. po-
litical haranguing stemming from
this SUpCl'pUVvCl' spat in the Summer
Games will end once the LA. Games
are finished. Past political interfer-
ences. including racial overtones.
fatal terrorism and apartheid differ-
ences were unique of the respective
Mexico City. Munich and Montreal
Games. They should not be forgot-
ten. but were nonetheless isolated
incidents.

Of course. when the Seoul Games
commence in September i988, new
international tensions may be evi-
dent. But if world leaders can learn
from past mistakes. though that’s as
difficult as threading rope through a
needle’s eye. there will be no more
duping the Russians. Their absence
from any Olympics eradicates the
true spirit of competition

Table manners
made easy

  BY JONNV 
‘ gsrarr Writer

If someone were to approach
you and ask, “How would you
like to see a play that involves 57
different characters?” what
would you say? “No, no. Too
difficult to follow” or “Too
tough on the brain"? Maybe. But
spread those characters over 18
separate “stories” that span
more than five decades, and it
begins to sound likeia full-
ﬂedged experience. Pittsburgh
Public Theatre’s current produc-
tion of A.R. Gurney .lr.‘s The
Dining Room is just that.

A charming comedy, the play
revolves around that old and
now all—but-extinct vestige of
American family unity —— the
dining room table. Through a
succession ‘of tightly written
vignettes, Gurney masterfully

L portrays the cultural as well as

we

the social and interpersonal
changes America has undergone
since the Great Depression.
Nothing short of brilliant is
the direction of Susan Einhorn,
weaving the 18 episodes together
smoothly and swiftly, but with a
pacing that is considerate of the
audience. Moving through such
a variety of characters and situa-
tions in just two hours could be
potentially confusing, but the
simplicity of the set (the omni-
present table, some chairs and a
few pieces of furniture). min-
imal, if any, costume changes
and fine ensemble acting pull the
sprawling play together.

Of the cast, most memorable
is Gregg Almquist, who plays an
unbelievable range of charac-

ters. From the mischievous,
excitable child named Brewster,
whom we see attending his little
friend Winkie’s birthday party,
to a crusty old codger ofa grand-
father who grills his grandson
when he requests money for col-
lege, Almquists’s ability to use
gesture and vocal characteriza-
tions alone to define his roles is
impressive.

Joining Almquist is a com-
pany of ﬁve other players,
including Cynthia Crumlish, a
veteran of both Broadway and
off-Broadway. All are similarly
challenged by a host of contrast-
ing roles. ‘

Along with the richness of the
characterizations in The Dining
Room, Gurney‘s writing
deserves applause. The play deli-
cately offsets its seriousness with
humor, as we are allowed to
eavesdrop on a number of very
personal conversations that take
place around the table, ranging
from the grim to the absurd.

Imagine the scene of an aged

These situations are meticu-

room, allegedly made an off-

introduction to Modern English

The image of today's British
rocker combines various ele-
ments of glamour rock, punk
revolt and a consumer-conscious
sensibility that belongs uniquely
to the 805. In this way, Culture
Club’s outrageous and charis-
matic Boy George O’Dowd
merely typifies the most extreme
characteristics that symbolize
the new rock—n-roll.

Britian’s Modern English, on
the other hand, defy most easily
attached labels, and the band’s
lead singer, Robbie Grey,
appears almost self-con
tradictory. Admittedly turned
on to music by the Sex Pistols’
assault on commonly held per-
ceptions of pop music, Grey
remains, in spite of those early
inﬂuences, a gentleman first, a
rock—n-roll star second.

All of this is made considera-
bly easier for Grey in light of the
enviable opportunity he has had
in attaining success while keep-
ing the experience close to home.
Modern English is a band made
up of five former schoolboy
chums all from the London sub-
urb of Colchester, a detail that

‘Grey appreciates.
It’s the people, he says, who
ave put Modern English on the
map.’ “We all get on so well
together; we just know each
other so well. The fact is, we’re
normal, and we’ve got our feet
on the ground.”

Getting their feet on the
ground proved to be no small
task for the band, however. An

explosion of bands erupted from

the ﬂame called punk, which was
lit by the Sex Pistols, the Clash,
the Damned and others. And as
Grey admits, “I only started lis-
tening to music in I977. I mean, I
heard it on the radio, but I really
didn’t take notice of it.” Inspira-
tion was one thing, but a good
hook quite another, he found.

Initially, the band struggled,
playing local club dates, trying
to get material together and hop-
ing for a recording contract to
make it all worthwhile. Eventu-
ally, 4AD, an independent label,
signed the band and released two
singles that failed to gain much
attention. Then, in April of 1981,
Modern Engish released an
album called Mesh and Lace,

,which paid off the band’s debt to
punk.

“Mesh and Lace was an album
from a band that was two years
old and hadn’t learned to play
yet,” is the way Grey sees it now.
Critics and listeners agreed, and
after more than two" years
together, Modern English still
found themselves a struggling
band that lacked not only a focus
for their music but a significant
listening audience, as well.

It was more than a year before
the band released its next 1p, and
during that time, Modern Eng-
lish played and rehearsed end-
lessly, searching for the direction
that might allow them to explore
their increasing interest in mel-
ody. Finding a producer became
a priority, and when Hugh Jones
(of Echo and the Bunnymen
notoriety) signed on to handle
the boards, the band’s second
album, After The Snow, was
within earshot.

The choice of Hugh Jones was
critical, according to Grey. “The
thing that Hugh Jones really
helped us with was just getting
knowledge; we had to learn how
to write songs. Ever since Mesh
and Lace, though, we’ve been
learning.”

. And like a just reward to
gifted students, After The Snow

JUNE 6. 1984
sent Modern English on a head-
lining tour of Europe, with the
album’s strikingly beautiful “I
Melt With You” breaking things
for the band all over, including
the backward listening United
States. "

The success of “I Melt With
You" on MTV gave the band the
exposure they needed to crack
the U.S. market and played an
instrumental role in having Sire
Records pick up After The Show
for distribution in this country.
Although it is hard to imagine all
this without heavy rotation on
MTV, Grey is reluctant to
endorse the concept of Music
Television.

“The theory is great,” he says,
“but it doesn’t work. It's sup-
posed to be something construc-
tive, but I‘m afraid it’s become a
bit boring. I think it’s a great
idea, and it does work some-
times, but I’m against 24-hour
television.” All charm and
sincerity, Grey looks objectively
at the medium that paved the
way for his band in this country.

Off of the warmer reception
that After The Snow garnered
from listeners and critics alike,
the band sought considerable
preparation time again when
looking ahead to their current
release, Ricochet Days. Jones
was once again enlisted as pro-
ducer, and the band looked to
continue the maturing process
that had been taking place since
the early days.

“This new record took us a
long time to record,” he says.
“We used a lot ofclassical instru-
ments and really took our time
over it —— lots of mixes.
Obviously, our goalwas to do
something better than After The
Snow, and I think we have.”

Indeed, the music on Ricochet
Days shows an enormous leap in
maturity for the band. The addi-
tion of classical -instruments, the
sensitive use of empty spaces in

By Dlanetefkowltz
Staff Writer

It is because of this U.S. action,
said Robert Donnorummo of the
University Center for International
Studies, that the Soviets made their
recent move.

“The pullout of the Olympics was
indeed a payback for I980,” he said.
“We denied the Soviet Union a very
important symbol of global leader-
ship. I think we, as Americans,
didn’t realize how important a sym-
bol that was.

“Politics have been a very impor-
tant part and now an integral part
[of Olympics]," Donnorummo said.

Political science professor Ronald
Linden agreed. “Any time you have
nations and the representatives get-
ting together for any purpose," he
said, “then you have politics by
definition."

He said Russian fear of their ath-
letes defecting to the United States
factored in their decision not to
come to Los Angeles, where an
organization to aid defectors exists.

“Reports indicate that the Soviets
wanted some sort of a pledge from
the United States that if anyone
defected, they would be returned —

Olympics: Post, 1

/which the U.S. was correct not to
give,” Linden said. J;-.-vi

One line of reasoning is that tlﬂfé

boycott isjust one in a series ofanti-
American actions by the Soviets,
exemplifying a further breakdown
in East—West relations.

Other recent actions reflecting
those sentiments are the calling off
nuclear arms-control talks and ref-
using to allow dissident physicist
Andrei Sakharov’s wife to leave the
country for medical treatment in the

West. ' ",__\.

“As the Cold War gets even coldﬁér
in 1984, [boycott] is part ofa pattern
of relations," Donnorummo said.

The 1988 Olympics are scheduled
to be held in Seoul, South Korea,
and there are already concerns
about what kind of political activi-
ties will arise there.

Some say moving the Olympics to
a permanent neutral site — Greece,
for example —— will help to depolitic—
ize the Games, while others say
denationalization is necessary to
revive the true spirit of the Gamegx

Time magazine writer Roger
Rosenblatt said, however, ’ both
these methods would be ineffective
safeguards against terrorism or
boycotts.

Donnorummo favors decentrali-
za§~.0n of the Games and suggests
di’:$ding them into five sites accord-
ing to geographical location -
separate sites for the Americas,
Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.

“What we need is a change in the
way we view the Games," he said.
“Politics and the Olympics are not
going to be separated."

Axthelm also said the breaking
down of the Games into many
smaller competitions might prove
efiﬁtive, and “... such individual
championships would free all the
nations of the headaches of security
(and) the fear of terrorism.”

But what kind of changes will be
made in time for the Seoul Games, if
any, and how effective those changes
will be, is unknown. Most agree that
the Games will go on and that, for
the world’s athletes and the glory of
competition, it is sometimes even
worth the price.

“The  Olympic ideals of virtue in
competition are, from time to time,
acgially realized,“ Rosenblatt said.

The Soviet boycott of the 1984
Olympic Games, with 13 Commu-
nist countries following suit, has
raised the question not only if the

Games will be able to continue in
future years, but if they should go

on, despite the games which nations,

play on the political front.

According to experts, the Olym-
pics will, and should, survive the
politics connected with them, but
some changes in the Games format
may have to be made.

“The ongoing question is whether
we should keep this particular festi-
val going despite the incursions of
the real world," Pete Axthelm wrote
in the May 2l edition of Newsweek.

Axthelm said the answer may lie
in the track record of violence at
recent Olympics.

At the 1968 Games in Mexico
City, for example, 40 students and
observers were killed by police dur-
ing a rally I0 days before the Games
began.

Eleven Israeli athletes were killed
by Arab terrorists at the 1972
Munich Games, and the United
States pulled a no-show four years
ago at the Moscow Games to protest
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Axthelm’ called those 1980 Olym-
pics, .“probably the most dazzling
propaganda circus since Hitler's in
Berlin in 1936."

“Well, I think it's regrettable that
the Soviets have boycotted the

Olympics, but it doesn‘t come as any
surprise considering the state ofrela-
tions between the Soviet Union and
the United States. l think that the
boycott is just the demonstration

they should be here.

“I think that as soon as the next

there's going to be no more world

, for baseball team to flourish in the Big East

By Scott Delletl
Staff Writer

The decision to establish a Big
East baseball conference, passed at
last month’s meetings, could be
beneficial to the Pitt program, but
not without a stronger financial
commitment.

For years as a Division I inde-
pendent, the Panthers struggled
with inclement spring weather and
an early semester break to field
respectable teams, but were never
able to merit national attention.

With the formation of the league,
Pitt will step up in competition,
much in the same way the entire
athletic program, especially the bas-

ketball and swimming teams, did _

upon entering the conference.
A possible berth in the NCAA
tournament, instant rivalries and

'-novelty of belonging to a quality

conference are among the beneﬁts
Pitt will enjoy.

“Joining the conference should
help us immeasurably. The quality
of the conference adds credibility to
the program,” head coach Bobby
Lewis said.

“As an independent, you don’t
know where you‘ stand. Now you
know where you stand.”

Athletic director Ed Bozik, who
voted for the conference atthe meet-

ings, is optimistic. “It gives the play-
ers somet_hing“to shoot for,” he said.

One problem does exist, however.
To compete in a quality league, a
team must have quality players.

Five of the Big East teams quali-
fiedgfor the East Coast Athletic Con-
ference tournament this year. Seton
Hall came within one game of
advancing to the College World
Series.

All Pitt can boast of is a winning
record going against local competi-
tion like Carnegie-Mellon and Fre-
donia State. Granted, the Panthers
played decent baseball teams, but
hardly the caliber of the Big East.

Their only opponent who could
challenge the talent within the Big
East was Florida State, who cut-
scored the Panthers 3l~-l in three
games.

Translation: The move to the Big
East could mean hard times for the
Pitt baseball team until the athletic
department increases its
commitment.

A successful athletic program
relies on recruiting, facilities, staff
and a number of other factors
directly related to money. Bozik,
however, said there will be little
extra effort (i.e., money) put forth to
improve the personnel. -

“Schools will pick and choose
what sports they will emphasize,”

I

Bozik said. “Baseball being added as
a championship sport doesn’t alter
our plans.”

While Pitt cannot be compared to
successful Northern baseball
schools like Maine or Seton Hall,
both of which lack major college
football programs that can easily
suck up an athletic budget, that is
hardly an excuse to forego a sturdy

financial commitment to the base- ,

ball program.

Without such a commitment,
competitiveness in the Big East can-
not be expected. City League stan-
douts simply cannot be depended
upon to quench the nationwide tal-
ent ﬁelded by other teams in the Big
East. _ i

The Pitt program has offered and
will continue to offer between four
and six full scholarships,-which are
divided ‘among as many as 26
players.

Bozik, though, said that any
financial increases will occur in the
travel budget, which will be double
that oflast year’s. The annual week-
long trip to Florida will continue as
in the past.

The other way to get funding is to
take in revenue, as other schools
have done. Not at Pitt though,
where the geographic setup of Trees
Field would hamper such an effort.

“There are no immediate plans for

generating money,” Bozik said. “We
don’t have the facility.

“I don’t envision baseball as a
revenue producer at the University
of Pittsburgh.”

Money may not be the only prob-
lem. There may be a communication
gap between Bozik and Lewis. Not
that the two have difficulty getting
along, but simply don’t know what
the other is doing.

Lewis was not informed of the
results of the Big East meetings in
Providence two weeks ago until told
by a reporter almost a week later. He
also claimed that he did not know
Boz1'k’s position on the baseball
league. '

“He asked for my feelings on it,”
Lewis said. “My suggestion was to
vote yes."

Bozik was apparently for the
league and voted in favor. of it, as did

‘the eight other athletic directors.

“We began to discuss the idea last
year," Bozik said. “I was in favor of
it, but 1 had to get some rough feel of
the cost."

Bozik, though, has not confirmed
that he will reinforce any commit-
ment to meet that cost, yet retains
the same goals as the other directors.
“The Big East tournament is our
target," Bozik said.

. The target is unlikely under the
circumstances. .

Panther track season ends in disappointment

By Charlie O'Hara
Senior Editor

The NCAA track and field cham-
pionships held this past weekend in
Eugene. Oregon. put an end to the
long collegiate) season and the All-
America dreams of two Panther
competitors.

Garland Brown and Darryl Shep-
herd entered the meet with high
hopes, but those hopes were dashed
in the qualifying heats as neither was
able to advance in their respective
event.

For Brown, his fourth place 800-
meter time of 1:49.35 fell a mere 1.02
seconds short of the qualifying
standard for the ﬁnal eight in the

Sergeant James Chester of the
Pitt campus police won a gold medal
in power-lifting at the Pennsylvania
Police Olympics.

The 37-year old Chester lifted a
combined weight total of 1,205
pounds (480 in the dead lift, 420 in
the squat and 305 in the bench press)
and easily captured the first place
prize in the masters‘ l98—lb. class.

The victory qualifies him for the
International Police Olympics later
this summer in Phoenix, Arizona.

“l‘ve been training for about a
year and a half now on my own,”
Chester said. A

He hopes that in the future there-
will be training facilities at the cam-
pus police department.

Chester is optimistic about his
chances to win a medal in Pheonix
but said he realizes that the competi-
tion will be a bit tougher.

Two other Pitt policemen won

gold medals in softball at the Penn-
sylvania. Police Olympics. Lloyd
Keith Rogers and Henry A.
Rogowski were both members ofthe
state champion team that defeated
the state police and the county depu-
ties to take home the gold.

Nellis, GiIlespie,tapartlolpate.in tour 

»- Byiletosa Varloy »
For the Pitt News

“I want to be a good inﬂuence on
other wrestlers and athletes. I want
to share my talents with them."

That is exactly what University of
Pittsburgh wrestler Kyle Nellis will
be doing this summer.

The junior from Glenshaw was
chosen to tour with Athletes in
Action, a team of Christian all-stars
which tours different countries.

The tour, which will run from
June 7 to 16, will take Nellis to Mex-
ico, Panama and Puerto Rico. It is
set up to teach and train the athletes
to use the ready made platform of
sports in creative ministries around
the globe.

“It will give me the opportunity to
first, and most importantly, share
my faith with others,” Nellis said.
“Also it will give me the chance to
wrestle.” .

Nellis became involved with Ath-
letes in Action after hearing about
the experiences of his brother Kraig,
who went on the tour two years ago.

In order to compete, the athletes
must raise their own funds, which
cover the costs of insurance and
equipment. Nellis was able to raise
the needed $3,200 for his trip.

“I wrote a letter explaining what I
would be doing, and sent it to a lot of
people I know,” Nellis said. “I am
thankful to those who helped me
both financially and through prayer.
Everyone really came through. I was
surprised at how easy it was to raise
the money.“

Nellis. who has been highly suc-
cessful at Pitt. compiled a two-year
record of 44—l9 and -t:redits Shaler
coach Bob Siar for lielping him.

“He had a big influence on me."

Wrestler Kyle Nellis and volleyballer Sally Gillespie will tour the world with the
Christian all-star teams assembled by the Athletes for Action group

Nellis said. “He was the one who got
me started. He made me realize that
there is more to life than wrestling.
He produced not only quality
wrestlers. but also quality people."

Nellis came to Pitt for several
reasoiis.

"It is close to home. has a good
acadeiiiic program and I just had a

Don '1‘ Let

gut feeling," Nellis said. “I was try-
ing to decide between several
schools. I just knew Pitt was the
right one.”

Along with being a successful ath-
lete. Nellis’ talents also expand to
the classroom. The electrical engi-
neer major is an academic All-

America nominee and has also been
named to the Athletic Director’s
honor roll.

“I would like to someday be an
All-America." Nellis said. “Right
now. though, I am concentrating on

becoming the best wrestler I can be."

each network (ABC and CBS)
makes a definite commitment in the
spring to televise certain games that
they perceive as being of great
importance, such as the Pitt-Penn
State game. .
This marks the eighth time in nine
years that the annual clash will be
shown on a national network.

DDC]

College and professional football
coaches and players from around
the country teamed up on May 21
and raised a record $985,000 at the
sixth annual Foge Fazio Leukemia
Open. The funds will benefit the
Leukemia Society of Western
Pennsylvania.

Among the participants were
Ohio State’s Earle Bruce, Syracuse’s
Dick MacPherson, Tennessee’s
Johnny Majors and West Virginia's
Don Nehlen.

Bob Matheson, assistant coach of

the Miami Dolphins, received the.’ '
annual Courage award and Joey

Lafferty, an ll-year-old from Forest
Hills, received the annual apprecia-
tion award and has been chosen as
the Panther team mascot for the
i984 football season.

“I am thrilled that we’ve reached
this year’s goal,” said chairman Ed
lfft, “and that brings us to our six-
year total of $250,000.”

DUE]

Another spring practice season
has come and gone, and now ques-
tions arise: How did they look? Was
there much improvement? Where
are the strengths and weaknesses?
To such questions, starting quarter-
back John Congemi has some
answers.

“Our main goal coming into the
spring drills was to progress. We
didn’t want to sit back. We wanted
to improve and 1 think we did just
that.”

The most notable improvements
were made on offense. “We made a
lot of headway on the offensive side
of the ball,” head coach Foge Fazio
said. “Its the best that the offensive
line has looked in two or three years
during spring drills.”

The rest of the offense looks
equally strong. With the return of
Congemi and receiver‘Bill Wallace
the passing attack should be in top
form, while the running game
should also improve with time due

GREAT OFF-CAMPUS LIVING
THE BEST all around DEAL

to a number of returning players
such as Chuckie Scales.

We can win with Scales; he hand-
les the ball real well, and can catch
coming out of the backfield,” said
Fazio.

On an individual level, flanker
Dwayne Milloy and linebacker
Steve Apke, a pair of sophomores,
were the recipients of the 10th
annual Ed Conway Memorial
Awards as the most improved offen-
sive and defensive players.

The defensive line seems to be the
most glaring weakness for the
Panthers.

UDD

The Entertainment and Sports
Programming Network has
announced that it will kick off its
exclusive. live. nrime-time NCAA
college football supplementary se-
ries on Saturday, September l at 8
p.m. when Pitt hosts Brigham
Young.

Pitt was 8-3-l last season, while
BYU had an 11-1 record. The Panth-
ers will be led again by consensus
All-America offensive tackle Bill
Fralic and quarterback John Con-
gemi, while the Cougars will attempt
to replace All-America quarterback
Steve Young.

ESPN will broadcast 14 live
national games per season over the
next two years in accord with its
supplementary series agreement’
with the NCAA. The series is con-
tingent upon the pending Supreme
Court decision regarding ownership
of college football television rights.

DOC!

Pitt students and Golden Panth-
ers have joined forces to form the
i984 Pitt Football Marketing Team,
which hopes to sell out Pitt Stadium
for all home games. In order to
achieve this. they are involved in an
all-out effort to sell season tickets
for ’84. .

The idea for this project generated
with Bob Heddleston, executive
director of the Golden Panthers. It
was then turned over to Dick Luke-
hart, ticket manager, who, along
with sports information director Jim
O‘Brien, promotions director Kim-
ball Smith and assistant basketball
coach Joe DeGregorio, put together
this team. ‘ ’

According to Lukehart. the goal
that had been set is to sell 30.000
season tickets. a 50 percent increase
over last year.

“It is a high goal to set.“ Lukehart
said. “but if you don‘t set high goals
for yourself then you don't attain
high levels of achievement."

With a home schedule for next
season that includes teams such as
Brigham Young. Oklahoma and
West Virginia, selling tickets should
not be a difficult endeavor.
