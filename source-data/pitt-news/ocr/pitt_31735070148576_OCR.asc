ACLU
lawsuit
settled

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

The American Civil Liberties Union
and Pitt have reached a $48,500
settlement after a man ﬁled a law-
suit against the Pitt police in 2009
for violating his First and Fourth
Amendment rights.

Pitt police arrested Elijah Ma-
theny, a Hill District resident, on
April 29, 2009, and charged him
with violating the state’s Wiretap
Act when he used his cell phone to
record ofﬁcers detaining and ques-
tioning his' friend after they caught
him searching for discarded items
in a construction bin outside Bou-

. quet Gardens.

Glen Downey, a private lawyer
handling the case for the ACLU,
said that the case went into me-
diation, which then resulted in a
settlement with Pitt. He said that
the details of what went on in me-
diation are conﬁdential.

Pitt’s insurance company, not
the University directly, will pay the
settlement, Downey said. ,

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said the University had no com-
ment on the settlement.

that Pitt spokesman Robert Hill

Matheny was arrested on a vio-

Act. The Pitt police oﬂicer called
the Allegheny County District
Attorney’s Office to conﬁrm the
violation of the act and authorize
the arrest.

Pitt, state senators discuss funding

Michael Ringling
For The Pitt News

A University panel met with Penn-
sylvania state senators in an effort
to increase Pitt’s involvement in the
state-ﬁinding process after state ap-
propriations decreased by $40 mil-
lion this year.

Members of Pennsylvania’s Sen-

ate Appropriations Committee met .

on Monday with Chancellor Mark
N ordenberg and his panel — which
included Student GovemmentBoard
president Molly Stieber, a profes-
sor and the chair of Pitt’s Board
of Trustees —— to plead Pitt’s case
for an increase in funding for next
school year.

Nordenberg said that the discus-

sion was “a clear signal that they
take the issues seriously” during the
four-hour public meeting in Alumni
Hall.

The meeting follows months of
budget bickering, whichbegan when
Gov. Torn Corbett slashed Pitt’s state
appropriation by 22 percent inJune.
The cuts contributed to a $70 ‘mil-
lion deﬁcit in Pitt’s annual budget,
causing it to increase in—state tuition
by 8.5 percent, a $28 million boost.
But the extra cash only covered
40 percent of the budget cap, and
University oﬂicials said it would cut

, from programs and departments to -
make up the remaining $42 million

deﬁcit.

Previously, Pitt has remained
tight-lipped about which programs
would face cuts, but at the meet-

ing, Nordenberg said that issues
such as facility maintenance and
library system acquisitions might
suffer as consequences of the cuts
over time.

Pitt biological sciences professor
Graham Hatfull said on the panel
that University research has also
been negatively affected by the bud-
get cuts because his department has
had to make operational cuts.

“The research infrastructure
must be strong, and it becomes
strong by having a good faculty
and the ability to bring in exter-
nal funds,” Hatfull said. “It would
be very difficult to absorb ﬁirther
cuts.”

Hatfull stressed the importance
of research to a university.

, “The better the research, the

TURN T0 PG. 6 FOR WSUAL SUMULA ION

better the undergraduate educa-
tion. The better the undergraduate
education, the better the research,”
he said.

State Sen. Jake" Corman, the
Republican chair of the appropria-
tions committee, said the goal of
the meetingwas “to understand the

. investment [the state is] making,

and the return that we are getting,”
referring to both the economic and
social returns of the state’s funding
for higher education.

Nordenberg said the current lev-
els of state funding are unacceptable
for the future of higher education.

“I don’t think that we should ac-
cept this year as the new normal,”
he said. “The impact of most of the
cuts is nothing you would see in-

Downey: Recording police a national conversation

ACLU 4 1

ing without the consent of all parties in-
volved, but it does not apply to people who
audio record government officials on public
property because there is no expectation of
privacy, according to an ACLU press release
sent injune. '

The charges against Matheny were later
amended, and he was charged with disor-
derly conduct and deﬁant trespassing. In
July 2009, all of the charges were dismissed
at a preliminary hearing.

In the 2009 lawsuit, the ACLU alleged
that Pitt police violated Matheny’s First
and Fourth Amendment righm by punish-
ing him and conﬁscating his cell phone for
legitimately trying to gather information
about the police activity happening at the
scene.

Downey said that Matheny’s case was
an important one to take up because it oc-
curred right before the G-20 Summit two

years ago, and he wanted to make sure that
innocent people weren’t arrested for

$6

tions of people being arrested for using their
cell phones to record during the G—20.

We need to determine whether .
people can pick up their cell phones
  and record.

were going to happen at G-20.

“Our position is that it’s very im-
portant, especially with emerging technol-
ogy, that people should be able to document
What public ofﬁcials are doing,” he said. “In

this case, someone tried to stop that from
occurring.”

The lawsuit also alleged the district at- V

torney’s omce engaged in “a pattern of er-
roneously advising law enforcement that
audiotaping police oiﬁcers in public violates
Pennsylvaniab Wiretap Act,” the ACIJU state-
ment said. a

As part of an earlier settlement, Al-
legheny County and the district attorneys
oiiice released a memo in September 2010
tellirg district attorneys and local police
chiefs that recording police oﬂicers in the
process of their duties does not violate the
Wiretap Act.

Although this case was local, Downey
said that recording public officials is a na-
tional conversation.

“We need to determine whether peo-
ple can pick up their cell phones and re-
cord.”

Stieber continued the defense of Pitt stu-
dents’ economic vulnerability, saying that the
in—state tuition was a vital inﬂuence in her
decision to come to Pitt.

“People have to work really hard to come to
college,” Stieber said. “Not everyone can come
to college with their parents paying for i ”

She said the reduction in state funding
could have something to do with the state’s
perception of Pitt.

”For the state to reduce our funding, it

makes me think that the state doesn’t think »

the University is a good investment,” Stie-
ber said. “We carmot balance the debt on the
backs of Pennsylvania’s and the country’s ﬁn-
est studen .” H

Stephen Tritch, chairman of the Board of
Trustees, concluded the testimonies of the
University panel by appealing to the state
senators to restore state appropriations to
the University.

“We did not expect to be targeted for the

state’s budget-cutting responsibilities,” Tritch
said. “I can only hope that you will make the
restoration of appropriations to more reason-
able levels of funding a high priority as you
begin building the Commonwealth’s budget
for the next ﬁscal year.”

Democratic Appropriations Chairman
Vincent Hughes, D-Montgomery, conceded
the necessity of higher education to facili-
tate economic growth and admitted that the
amount of ﬁmding cuts was extensive.

“By investing in [higher education] insti-

tutions, you can create higher-paying jobs,”
Hughes said. “[Universities] are not just
centers for learning, but they are centers for
economic growth that put people to work at
a higher level of wages.” _

Corman, R— Centre, stressed the need to
ﬁnd a healthy balance between state funding
and private revenue.

“We’d like to give money to the universities,
but we have to have it to give it,” Corman said.
“This is the just the beginning of a conversa-
tion that is overdue.” I \_

Is Facebooktoo
important to us?

Wethinknowis a goodtimeto observe
and reﬂect on our priorities.

The London Science Museum sur-
veyed 3,000 British adults and found
that they ranked Facebook ahead of

cars and ﬂushing toilets.

The Brits also ranked sunshine
astheirNo. 1need— andwithmore
dreary Pittsburgh weather always just
around the comer, we can deﬁnitely
relate. So let’s think: Would our needs
be any different than theirs? Are we
really so aware that we would ditch
Facebook in favor of, say, a nice, hot
shower? We’d sure like to think so, but
let’s look closer.

Facebookis our gtetocomrntmira
tion. It links us with past friends, net-
work contacts and familywhile provid-_
ing access to their thoughts, ideas and
lives. It’s urmerving to acknowledge,
but Facebook is what keeps many of
us sane. Our societal needs are sati-
atedbythe abilitytobesocialthrough
a computer.

Online addictions workinsomeway

to meethumanneeds, accordingto psy-

chologist Abraham Maslow’s famous
Hierarchy of Needs. Even though on-
linesocialcontactisthrough computer
screens, socialnetworking and Internet
satisfy the needto be loved, social and
connected to others. Sunshine, clean

drinkingwater and refrigeration allow

for our bodies to ﬁmction in a healthy .

way. I

The Science Museum’s studyworked
withthe exhibit, “WaterWars:Fightthe
Food Crisis,” to show the importance
of clean drinkingwater, which ranked
in importance one place lowerthanan
Internet connection. ‘ .

It’s too clearthat it’s easyto overlook
thebareessentials oﬂife.Ascollege stu-
dents, things like clean drinkingwater
and refrigerators are commonplace
in most of our lives, and it’s obvious
that a commodity like the Internet is
rankedhighlyacross the pondbecause
the ﬁrst tier of Maslow’s needs chart
is already met for the vast majority of
those polled.

We need to belong, and Facebook
allowsusto do so. Butthis study shows
that it’s interesting to take a look at
what’sreallyimportantinourlives. The
list of material needs produced by the
study showsthatperhaps ourpriorities
aren’t exactly where we thought they
were. Much of the world is mocking
this study and how the subjects’ needs
areout ofbalance. '

You can decide for yourself.

To the Editor,

I’mwritingin responseto 'I‘amara

whichwas published inthe Sept. 12 is-

and do not wishto offend her. Tamara
states that religion should be kept out
ofalleventsduetothosewhoarenotaf—
ﬁliatedwithreligion. Since somepeople
do not feel comfortable with religion,
events open to the public should be
secular.

However, this must be consid-
ered: 78.5 percent of Americans are

and 16 percent are non-aﬂiliated, L6

that, since the majority of Americans
(and rdguessthe Pitccampus aswell!)
are Christian, it canbe argued that all

A Jesus-based!

The above is an obviously ﬂawed

argument. Thus, itcanonlymakesense ‘

that Tamarafs is as well. One group of
people, no matter the size, should not
decide proceedings for others. A clear
mqority of people todaystilladhereto

Perhaps the answer could have
been to have a nondenominational
prayer or even a silent moment for

asTamarapointedout, one groupcan-

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

There is such a thing as too much
leadership. _
Asdemonstrated bythe complaint‘

of a Confederate ofﬁcer who once said -
that Georgia militia companies were A

comprised of “3 ﬁeld oﬂicers, 4 staff
oﬂicers, 10 captains, 30 lieutenants
and1privatewithamiseryinhisbow-
els,” it’s possible to have too much of
a good thing when that good thing is
leadership. .-

The requirement of the OCC that
students engageinleadership develop-
mentthrough programs titled, “Young
Leaders Boldly Forging Paths to the
Future of'Ibmorrow,” typiﬁes howthe
development ofleadership is constant-
ly stressed in our society. Although
some trainingin leadership is probably
notabad idea, thereareproblemswith
assuming everybody wants to, can, or
should become a leader.

o How did we get to the point where
everybodyis supposedtobealeader?
Iblame Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson
believedthatthefumre oft:he republic
lay in the hands of yeoman farmers
who would be ready, willingand able to
stokethe ﬂames kindled onthe Fourth
ofjuly, 1776; keep them frombeing

extinguished by the “feeble engines

_ of despotism,” and consume those

engines and allwho worked them.'As
such, everymanhad to be ableto lead.
As long as he was, you know, white.
This feeling was shared by other
Founding Fatherswho likewise saw
private leadership as the best guaran-
tor of afree state. The legend of Cincin-
natus was a particularly strong one.
Cincinnatus was a regular guy who
was granted dictatorial powers by the
Roman senate just longenoughto save
Rome from the ravishes of the Gauls

andthe horrorstheybrought—such.
as escargot, frog’s legs and snobbish— _

ness. After Cincinnatus routed the
Gauls, he went back to his plow in-
stead of decidingto pull a Moammar
Gadhaﬁ and remainincharge.Thisis
who George Washington was trying
to emulate when he kept resigning
positions of power only to keep get-
ting dragged back into positions of
influence.

— Rockefeller, Carnegie, Edison and

never mind membership in “Young

The problems with a drive to turn
everybody into leaders through for-
mal training aremanifold. First and
most obvious is the problem of ego,
asthose who aret:rained inleadership
mightﬁnd themselves more ﬁtto lead
thanthose who are not. Ifeveryone is
convinced that he is destined to lead,
this can result in discord, back-biting
and even civil war. On the other end

management. People who are very
good at some levels of management
can be disastrous at other levels. This
is an observation succinctly noted in
“The PeterPrinciple,” which holds that
people tend to be promoted to a level
at which they are incompetent.
Finally, with so much focus on
leadership, there is not enough focus
l on how to be a good follower. There is
a skill to being a good follower, from
knowing how to anticipate the needs
of your superiors to knowing what to

do when a superior is unreasonable. A

There is a need both to put the team

Lyons: Why Pitt is a sad, sad place

Kelan Lyons
Columnist

Where have all the sunshine and
rainbows gone?

A few weeks ago, to my everlast-
ing dismay, Pitt dropped from No. 8
to No. 20 in The Princeton Review’s
“Colleges withthe happiest students”
category. How, I wondered, could
this happen? Are the muggy skies,
icy hills and aggressive panhandlers
not enough to make us smile?

Now, I think I understand our
problem. From angry sports fans
to tuition hikes, I’ve cited a few

-developments I believe to have

contributed to our fall from grace
— developments that forced us to
shed tears that drenched our city
like Hurricane Irene drenched the
East Coast. I

Budget Cuts and Tuition Hikes

Unless you live under a rock,
you know that Pitt recently raised
its tuition 8.5 percent. Thanks to
the lovely Gov. Tom Corbett and
Pennsylvania’s budget, we can now
all enjoy taking out more loans and
look forward to paying back said
loans until we hit 50.

Understandably, the recent tu-
ition hike has stressed out a large
portion of our campus, forcing stu-
dents to pick up jobs they otherwise
wouldn’t pursue. Though I’m sure
some of you might have wanted to
work at_ a pizza shop since coming to
Pitt, I’m assumingthe majority would
have preferred to focus strictly on
clubs and 18- credit semesters.

Philadelphia Sports Fans
Before all the Philly fans stop

reading this column, let me just say
that I too hail from “just outside of

Philadelphia.” I ﬁilly support the
Eagles and the Flyers and cringed/
nearly transferred when the Steel-
ers almost won the Super Bowl last
year. I feel the same heartbreak and
anger you do everyjanuary and May
orjune when football and hockey
seasons end and I’m left with a bitter,
pessimistic outlook on life.

That being said, it’s no secret that
we Philly fans are much angrier and
more aggressive than our counter-
parts from the western side of the
state. They love their sports teams
too, but they aren’t willing to ﬂip
off a 10-year-old that happens to
be wearing another team’s jersey.
Though Pittsburgh fans might

have McDonald’s and The 0, but can
you really compare their products

Cheeseburgers? As a freshman liv-
ing in Lothrop, I would help myself
to this delectable food multiple times
a week. When the restaurant closed
down on Feb. 14 last year, Iwas noth-
ing less than heartbroken.

After all, did Wendy’s really be-

characterize us as “lacking class,” I

believe our nastiness derives from
the frustration we feel at nothaving
won a Super Bowl yet. The number of
Philadelphia—area students at Pitt is

staggering, so it’s not unreasonable

to think that our increasing despair
might have contributed to the drop

in happiness. ~

Wendy’s Leaving Oakland

Up until recently there existed
a Wendy’s on the corner of Atwood
Street and Fifth Avenue. Although
there are multiple branches of the

99

chicken nugget meal from the res-
taurant named after everyone’s fa-
vorite ginger.

In addition to the aforemen-
tioned trends, I predict Pitt’s hap-
piness rankingwill only drop further
next year, thanks to two further de-
velopments:

Self-Service Printing

Seriously, who thought this was
a good idea? Did a group of people
just get together and decide: “Hey,
students love to wait patiently in line
in the 10 or so minutes they have be-

tween classes, so why not make self-
service printing the default option?”
Although waiting in line to print a
mundane assignment is personally
my favorite way to spend an hour
of my day, it doesn’t seem to make
other students particularly happy.
This isn’t even considering the fact
that the machines break down fre-
quently and that those who print to
the regular printers usually just end
up jamming it. At the very least, it’s
inspired me to create a new game

called “ﬁnd the freshmen,’.’ where

you stand in line and tiy to pick out
the freshmen waiting to print their
papers; you can usually spot them
because they’re the only people in
line not complaining loudly about
how ineffective this new practice is
— mostly because they don’t have
anything to compare it to.

The Global Summit

The Pitt News reported on Sept.
8 that Pittsburgh will host the Global
Summit, a convocation of young
delegates from around the world,
in 2012. Although security will no
doubt beless militant_tha‘n during
the G-20, one can assume thatthese
future world leaders will want to be
protected and thus require numer-
ous SWAT teams to stand on every
street corner in Pittsburgh and men-
ace bystanders. With this kind of
stressful meeting hanging over our
heads next year, we can all expect
situations in Oakland to deteriorate
again soon. '

Nevertheless, I like to end my
columns on a positive note. Even if

‘ these sources of misfortune aren’t

amended, we’re still the 20th happi-
est college in America. If that doesn’t
cheer’ you up, think of it this way: At
least we’re having a better time than
West Virginia. I

Ineptitude inspires local to create new college

Written by Dan Law

Tim Cook Was. used to wielding a pen,
but he felt inept when it came to using
a hammer.

“After college I was prepared to write
a poem or an essay, but I couldn’t build
a house,” the Washington 8: Jefferson
graduate reflected. He points to this
thought as his inspiration for “the best
idea I’ve ever had.”

The Saxifrage School, a new college
to be located in Pittsburgh,.is Cook’s
creation, currently in the developmental
stage. Saxifrage will offer an alternative
to higher education, Cook says — one
that provides liberal arts training, trade

skill acquisition and foreignlanguage"

fluency. With current operating loca-
tions termed as “nomad campuses,” Cook
plans to open the doors to Saxifrage in
2014.

Cook’s preoccupation with the verti-
cal structure of higher education started
during his time as an undergraduate at
Washington &Jefferson College, a liberal
arts school of 1,500 students located in
Washington, Pa.

“Even before I graduated, I started
to ask questions like, ‘What’s the point
of this college experience? To get a
job? To live better after we graduate?

~ instead of then sitting back and relaxing, -
Cook asked questions and learned from 4

So we can change the world‘? Or just so
we can be really smart? Is that why I
paid $120,000?’ There seemed to be so
many mixed messages as to why we were
there,” he said.

Cook’s idea for the new school came
about when he realized he lacked what
he considers crucial skill sets.

While working on a community de-
velopment program with a local non-
profit, Cook recruited volunteers to help
build and repair local homes. During
the process, he realized that while he
was skilled at recruiting and supervising
volunteers, he lacked the technical trade,
skills needed for the work.

Using his own home as a testing
ground, Cook attempted to complete
repair and construction jobs on his own.
He jokes about how quickly he contracted
a professional to complete the work. But

the contractor. Through trial and error,
Cook came to appreciate the beneﬁts of
having practical skills such as the ability
to rewire a house and put up drywall.
“I started to realize the gap between
the theoretical and the real in the world-
What if college could teach us both to

make and to think? What if it could teach
us how to produce a very valuable, tan-
gible product, but also how to judge
whether this project is valuable, how it
should be used, and if it is necessary for
the good of society?”

So began Cook’s mission to develop a
new, academic model combining liberal
arts training and practical trade skills.

Saxifrage, although taking its own
approach, is not alone it its pursuit to
redeﬁne higher education. “DIY U” is
a blog created by Yale graduate Anya
Kamenetz as an interactive alternative
learning option that appeals to students

‘ who “don’t ﬁt the traditional mold” of

the structured four-year matriculation
design.

Pushing the envelope perhaps even
further, MIT has been working on provid-
ing undergraduate and graduate courses
for free online since 2002. Currently,
over 2,000 courses are available to the
browsing public directly from MIT’s web-
site. Both Harvard and Yale offer open
courses to those interested as well.

But Cook hasn’t found anything
quite like Saxifrage. Cook terms the

The Campus

The Saxifrage school will have a nontra-
ditional campus that’s nomadic and inte-
grates the students into the surrounding
neighborhood.

Students will live in an academic commu-
nity, but instead of dorms they will inhabit
a neighborhood and attend classes in un-
derutilized community buildings including
churches, libraries and storefronts.

There will be three nomadic campuses,
but project director Tim Cook has only cho-
sen one location so far — a ﬂedgling library
in Millvale, Pa., which will be open this year
from Oct. 1 to Nov. 31.

Cook and his aﬂiliates are scouting the
Manchester neighborhood, areas around
the Mexican War Streets and a spot in the
East End for the other two campuses. These
locations are slated to open in the spring and
summer of 2012, respectively.

Liberal arts degree valuable outsid

Written by Natalie Bell

I estimate that my existence this year will
cost no less that $22,254.

That’s shelter, food, miscellaneous sup-
plies and —— by far the most expensive —
tuition. I pay a whopping $15,272 to learn
how to think.

Such a huge chunk of money warrants
some heavy consideration of the question:
What exactly do I, along with thousands of
other students, think I’m doing spending

that much money on a liberal arts degree? A

Four years here mightbury some of my
friends in loans and pick clean some of their
parents’ pocketbooks, and not all of them
will graduate and ﬁnd a six-ﬁgure job. But I
still believe in a liberal arts education.

You’ve likely heard the argument that a
liberal arts education teaches you how to
think, and it does. In this increasingly tech-
savvy world where one can ﬁnd out James
Madison’s demeaning nickname — Little

Jemmy —— and his height —- in the range of ,

5—foot—2 to 5-foot-6 — in a matter of seconds,
fact memorization isn’t so important. What
is important is the ability to understand
those facts, synthesize them and put them
into context with the rest of the world.

Perhaps everyone has told you that you’re
here to learn how to think, but here’s the
second part of that: why it’s so important
to learn how to think.

First, it keeps your brain in shape for
creative thinking. Ellis Paul Torrance, the
“Father of Creativity,” tested children in
the ’5os and ’6os using what’s known as the
Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Ac-
cording to his data, creativity quotient (CQ)
was a better predictor for creative accom-

quisition.

And believe it or not, this relates to why
your liberal arts education — presumably a
continuation of the kind of varied education
you’ve had most of your life — is important.
When you don’t use neurons developed for a
speciﬁc purpose, like playing an instrument,

So while you're busy earning that
degree in biology, your foreign-
language requirement keeps your

plishments in adulthood than intelligence
quotient (IQ).

When you’re very young and you learn
something, your brain develops many im-
portant neuron routes in which informa-
tion can travel. This results in incredibly
crucial lifelong skills, such as language ac-

 99

those neurons die and it’s much more diffi-
cult to form those pathways in adulthood.
A liberal arts education affords you the
opportunity to develop a speciﬁc skill set,
while still utilizing those important neurons
you’ve created and exercised since child-
hood. So while you’re busy earning that

e of universities

degree in biology, your foreign-language

_ requirement keeps your Spanish up to par.

Hypothetically, when you want to do ﬁeld-
work in the Dominican Republic, you’ll have
the skill-set combination necessary.
Neurons and technical jargon aside, this
all factors into your creativity. The more
information you obtain and retain,.the more

you’re able to draw connections between ,

seemingly unrelated topics and come up
with new ideas. By forcing your brain to
work on several planes, you essentially
keep it well—rounded and capable of cre-
ative thought. - -

That, more than many other qualities,
will help later on.

Right now, you might be majoring in
one ﬁeld, but you could seamlessly slip
into another after graduation. ‘An article by

A Bloomberg Businessweek said that compa-
- nies like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup hire

a signiﬁcant portion of their new employees
with majors like psychology and English.
The article explained that the thinking
is that people with a passion for knowledge
andia keen ability to learn will fare just as
successfully in business as business majors
will. And the companies say that they gen-
erally ﬁnd that to be true. Business majors

School named for bloom in
Williams’ poem

Saxifrage 4 7

new school’s mission as “productive
inquiry,” a combination of the intel-
lectual and the practical all in one.

Cook named his school after the
saxifrage ﬂower, and he argues that
the ﬂower is a paradigm breaker. Wil-
liam Carlos Williams, in his poem “A
Sort of a Song,” uses the ﬂower as a
symbol for its gritty determination
to grow in seemingly infertile ground.
The ﬂower, says Cook, “represents
the convergence between ideas and
things.”

As of yet, the Saxifrage School has
some struggles to overcome. It has
recently filed with the IRS for status
as a non—profit. It has neither been
accredited by any higher education
association nor has it been granted
status as a college of higher learning.
Such distinctions are yet to come, ac-
cording to Cook. But until then, stu-
dents will not earn a degree.

But the school has taken a test
run.

Andrew Heffner, a member of the
Saxifrage board, said that this past
spring the Saxifrage team moved into
a space in the Mattress Factory — a
North Side art museum — in order
“show the prototype and give an idea
of what the school could be.” Over the
course of six weeks in April and May,
the Saxifrage team held outreach and
marketing sessions, taught art classes
and held concerts with open conversa-
tions following the events.

“We want these locations and events
to serve as easy entry points for people
nearby in the community. We’re con-
fident that we will gain momentum
as we open up new locations. At least
that’s the hope. We feel if we can do
well in these locations, then we can
build toward larger and more densely
populated neighborhoods.”

The concerts and a clothing swap
during this six week period were espe-
cially big draws in regards to generat-
ing interest, Heffner said.

“Everyone that has come to Saxi-
frage has felt that there was a short-
coming in the undergraduate experi-
ence or higher education in general
and are looking at ways to reconcile
those limitations.” The desire is to in-
vite people to talk about the big ques-
tions pertaining to the current state
of “college” and to generate a larger
conversation and inspire people, says

Saxifrage > 10

The Curriculum

The Saxifrage curriculum combines both
the practical know-how of trade skills and
liberal—arts—inspired analytical judgment.

In four years students will complete two
majors —— one liberal arts and one trade skill
major. On top of that, students must be ﬂuent
in Spanish to graduate.

At the moment, however, graduation will
not include one thing virtually synonymous
with such an accomplishment: a degree.

The Leaders

Cook has surrounded himself with 17
individuals serving in three capacities: the
founding team, a board of directors and
advisers. ‘

According to the Saxifrage website,
members of the board of directors collec-
tively hold three Ph.D.s and ﬁve master’s
degrees. —

Those applying their expertise to the
school’s development include an auditor
and accountant from a private ﬁrm and a
local nonproﬁt, an investment analyst from
BNY Mellon and a computer programmer
from Google, Inc.

The Saxifrage school’s tuition is already
set. Here’s how it compares to other local
schools.

Saxifrage’s annual cost: $6,500 ($5,000
tuition, $1,500 administrative fees) _

As with all new ideas, the prospec-

Howison feels that Saxifrage has what it
takes to succeed, he mentions potential
challenges.

“The sustainability in and of itself

Regardless of the difficulties associ-

“We’re realistic: People are going to

VOLLEYBALL

 

Panthers win two, lose one on ﬁrst road trip

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt volleyball team played

on an unfamiliar court for the
first time this weekend, but the
Panthers managed to continue
their success at the Residence
Inn/UCF Invitational.

Pitt (8-2), who finished 2-1 at
the invitational, spent the early
part of the season in Pittsburgh
with seven consecutive matches
in the Fitzgerald Field House.
Panther head coach Toby Rens
admitted that being the away
team can be a challenge but said
that his team responded well
overall. ' i

“It is different playing on
another court without the fa-
miliarity and support of a home
crowd,” Rens said. “Still, we
were able to focus on our play
in the matches, and that mental
part is huge on road trips.”,

The Panthers played three
matches over the weekend,
defeating Florida Atlantic and
UNC Greesnboro. In between,
Pitt fell to the University of
Central Florida, a team that
defeated No. 3 USC in its pre-
vious match.

Pitt is off to a solid start this
season, only losing matches to
UCF and defending national
champion Penn State. The Nit-
tany Lions are currently ranked
N o. 5 in the country.

In the first match of the-

weekend, the Panthers defeated
the Florida Atlantic Owls (0-
7) in three straight sets with
scores of 25-18, 25-18 and 25-16
and dominated most aspects of
the game.

The Panthers relied heavily
on their defense to limit the
Owls to just 19 kills while the
Panthers themselves posted
43. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Monica Wignot and senior
middle blocker Kiesha Leggs
contributed 11 and 10 kills, re-
spectively, to that total.

“Our offense was well—bal-
anced against Florida Atlantic,”
Wignot said. “It is nice to be
able to lead with the kills, but

The Pitt volleyball team left the Fitzgerald Field House for the ﬁrst time this season for the Residenc

it is definitely more important
to me that my offense helped
toward a win.”

Junior libero Margy Acton
led the defensive effort, earn-
ing a match-high 15 digs. Junior
outside hitter Alexa Campbell
chipped in with eight as the
Panthers tallied 38 digs total
in the match.

As part of a roster contain-
ing only two seniors, the un-
derclassmen have played con-
sistently well throughout the
year. Against Florida Atlantic,
another young player showed
her skill.

Coming back to the team af- ‘

ter rehabbing an injury, fresh-
man outside hitterjessica Wynn
made her season debut against
the Owls and finished with six
kills in the three sets.

“It was definitely nice to see
Jessica back in uniform,” Rens
said. “She is not quite at 100
percent yet, but the fact that
she still made an impact after
being out three weeks shows
her determination and impor-
tance to the team.”

The Panthers’ next match,
against the University of Cen-
tral Florida Knights, proved
more challenging, and the Pitt
team fell in three straight sets
by scores of 25-17, 25-22 and

25-13.

Coming off an upset victory
over No. 3 USC, the Knights (7-
1), used their momentum to pick
up a win from the Panthers.

'UCF out—hit Pitt by 11 kills
and —- except for an early 1-0
lead in the first set —— the Pan-
thers trailed the Knights for the
entire match.

“We knew going into the
weekend that UCF would be
our toughest match, especially
since they were on their own
court,” Rens said. “We got off

to a slow start and were never‘

able to recover to gain an ad-
vantage.”

Offensively, Leggs and Wynn
carried the Panthers with nine
and seven kills, respectively.
Acton once again led both teams
with her 17 digs.

Following the loss to UCF,

the Panthers regained their

confidence and finished the
invitational with a win, defeat-
ing UNC Greesnboro (4-6) in

Grading NFL teams’
quarterback situations

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

For an entire lockout-ﬁlled sum-
mer, writers and reporters spent
their timefinding NFL stories
that would appeal to the pub-
lic.

As weeks passed, teams be-
came overanalyzed and over-
hyped to ﬁll the void left by the
lack of N FL activity." And of all the
things analysts and columnists
liked to discuss, quarterbacks
sat at the top of the list.

Would Michael Vick sign his
big contract? Could Tim Tebow
climb the Broncos depth chart?
Was Peyton Manning going to be
ready for week one?

Well, with this Sunday finally
past, the predictions and hype
have come to fruition. With that
in mind, here is your ﬁrst week’s
grades on ﬁve NFL quarterback
situations:

The Indianapolis Colts and
Peyton Manning: I have one
thing to say to you Colts fans:
Close your eyes. It’s going to be
a long year. Doesn’t it feel like\
the ’90s again? The last time the
Colts played without Manning
for an entire season was 1997 —
when he was still at Tennessee.
Their record was 3-13. On Sun-
day the team came out against.
a division rival and looked as
bad as they could possibly have
looked. The defense was soft,
the replacement quarterback,
Kerry Collins, looked confused,
old and like he didn’t belong in
the league anymore and all Pey-5"
ton Manning could do was watch
from the sidelines. The result? A
34-7 trouncing at the hands of
the Texans.

Michael Vick and his huge
contract: Vick alone looked daz-
zling. His legs were fresh, his
arm was stronger than ever and

FOOTBALL

Former Panthers Revis, McCoy shine during week one

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬂ” Writer

The NFL season kicked off this weekend with
several Pitt alums making their professional
debuts and others continuing their careers
at football’s top level. V
Here’s a look at how former Panthers
performed in the NFL during week one:
Darrelle -Revis (Pitt comerback, 2004-

2006) carried thejets to a 27-24 win over the
Cowboys when he intercepted Tony Romo
at midﬁeld in the ﬁnal minute of a tied game
Sunday night. His return brought New York
into ﬁeld-goal range, and Nick Folk kicked
the game-winner with 27 seconds remain-
ing. ‘ ,

“We wanted them to think it was one-
on—one, but we actually had help on top,”
Jets head coach Rex Ryan said in a press
conference after the game. “Revis was able

to undercut it and get the interception. It
was a huge call by [defensive coordinator]
Mike Pettine at the perfect time. Revis made
a super play.”

Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt wide receiver,
2002-2003) had three receptions for 62
yards in his ﬁrst regular—season game with
new quarterback Kevin Kolb. So far, so good:
Arizonabeat Carolina, 28-21. -

LeSean McCoy (Pitt running back, 2007-
2008) had 122 yards on 15 carries in Phila-

delphia’s 31-13 win over St. Louis. His 7-yard
touchdown reception opened the scoring for
the Eagles, and his 49-yard touchdown run
in the fourth quarter capped it.

Teammate Dion Lewis, McCoy’s heir in
the backﬁeld at Pitt (2009-2010), began his

professional career with a modest 10 yards’

on two carries against the Rams.

New Orleans placed Greg Romeus (Pitt
defensive end, 2007-2010) on the “physical-
ly unable to perform” list on Sept. 2. Romeus,
out indeﬁnitely with a knee injury, is eligible
to return in Week 7. ‘

’ Another former Pitt defensive end,]abaal
Sheard (2007-2010), had three tackles -— in-
cluding two for a loss -— in his debut with the
Browns Sunday. Cleveland, though, dropped
its home opener to Cincinnati, 27-17.

Jonathan Baldwin (Pitt wide receiver,
2008-2010) missed Kansas City’s opener
against Buffalo due to a right-thumb injury
sustained in a preseason altercation with
teammate Thomas Jones. The Chiefs, who
selected Baldwin in the ﬁrst round of this
year’s ‘draft, lost 41-7. '

due to a season-ending knee injury. As he’d

Pitt, San Francisco had hoped Byham would

Dom DeCicco (Pitt defensive back, 2007-

2010) recorded his ﬁrst career tackle in Chi-

cago’s 30-12 win over Atlanta. DeCicco made
the Bears’ roster after signing with them in
late July as an undrafted free agent.

Henry Hynoski (Pitt fullback, 2008-
2010) recorded his ﬁrst NFL reception
Sunday with the Giants. Eli Manning found

- him in the left ﬂat for a 4-yard gain in the

fourth quarter. New York lost to Washing-

‘ ton, 28-14.

Aaron Berry (Pitt defensive back, 2006-
2009) had four tackles in Detroit’s 27-20 win
over Tampa Bay Sunday afternoon.

Two —time Pro Bowler Andy Lee (Pitt
punter, 2000-2003) wasn’t overworked
in San Francisco’s 33-17 win over Seattle.
He punted ﬁve times, averaging 59.6 yards

Cam Newton proves doubters wrong in NFLdebut _

Saul < 11

A the Rams simply couldn’t keep up once

he got out of the pocket. But all those

"things are to be expected. What aren’t

good signs for the Birds are the way their
offensive line has been protecting Vick
and the $100 million contract he signed
in August. Thetruth is that the contract
is borderline insane, considering the fact
that Vick missed three games last year
because of rib injuries and didn’t ﬁnish
out his last $100 million contract. Now
with week one over,.it looks a little bit

scarier to me. The Rams got to Vick early‘

and often, and the quarterback took way

more hits than any Eagles fan would want,

to see. If he stays healthy, Philadelphia
could be unstoppable. If he doesn’t, well,
it’s_ onto Vince Young.

Aaron Rodgers watches the throne:
For a defending Super Bowl champion,
Rodgers got little attention during the
offseason. According to him, that’s just
how he likes it. The Packers seemed al-
most forgotten until the season opener,
but they didn’t waste any time reminding
people who’s boss (for now). Rodgers was,
in a word, fantastic. He opened the game

by taking the Packers down the field and

throwing a touchdown, making the Saints
defense look like a practice squad. No-
body was going to get in his way, and he
ﬁnished with 312 yards and three touch-
downs. Look for Rodgers to make a trend
out of this the rest of the season.

Cam Newton playing like a No. 1
pick: Wow. Did you see this kid go off?
All the ‘haters, all the doubters, all the

' people who spent the summer saying he

could never be an NFL quarterback need
to (temporarily) bite their tongues. N ew-{
ton didn’t just put up record-setting stats
for a quarterback’s debut (422 yards, two
touchdowns, 110.4 QB rating); he was also
a leader. He got the ball to his playmakers
such as Steve Smith, he played with ﬁre

' and a smile on his face and he let no one

get in his way. It’s tough to imagine him

keeping anything close to this pace, but '

it’s important for people to recognize
he is capable of what he did on Sunday.
By far the most athletically gifted quar-
terback in the 2011 draft, Newton didn’t
just get it done. with his arm but also ran

for a score as well. It’s worth noting that

Newton’s team didn’t win the game and
the player that comes next on this list
did, but still, if I played in the NFC South
and watched him shred the Cardinals on
Sunday, I’d be taking a big nervous gulp
right about now.

Kevin Kolb starts a new chapter: For

all thetalk about Vick and Donovan Mc-

Nabbeover thelast few years, Kolb really

got lost in the storm. Even, Sunday when '

he led his new team to a 28-21 victory
over the Panthers and threw for 309 yards
and two touchdowns, everyone was talk-

' ing about the other quarterback — Cam

N ewton. While he quietly completed the
biggest game of his career and. got a young
Arizona team off to a 1-0 start, Kolb still
isn’t ﬁnding praise. So to round out our
list of overhyped offseason stories, here
is my letter of praise to Kevin Kolb:
4 Dear Kevin, ~ ' ‘

Donovan and Michael always steal your
thunder. I know nobody is talking about

rassing comeback attempt like Collins

‘because we felt they took us away from

our game plan,”.Zitzke said. “We tried
to use that loss as motivation for our
next match.”

With set scores of 25-21, 25-20 and
25-18, the Panthers completed their first
road trip of the year with a winning re-
cord of 2-1.

‘ Wignot set the pace for both teams
with her 15 kills, and Leggs also earned

double-digit numbers with her contri-

bution of 13. In her best outing of the
tournament, Acton recorded 19 digs and
earned the praise of her coach and her
setter. , ' ,
“Margy had an exceptional weekend
and mayhave had her best match of the
season against UNC Greensboro,” Rens
said. “She was physically all over the
court, and her passing was on target

throughout all three sets.”

Zitzke agreed with her coach and
noted the importance of strong defen-
sive play. .

“We really stress defense ﬁrst because
without a good pass, you can’t run an of-
fense and get the kills,” Zitzke said. “As
a setter, it is nice to know that I have a
player like Margy behind me to lead the
defense.”

Overall, Rens was pleased with his
team’s play in the UCF Invitational and
hopes that the Panthers can build from
the experience.

‘ “We had moments of great rallies and
high—level volleyball, which is encourag-
ing,” Rens said. “Even the loss to UCF can
be a way for us to learn how to be ready
for good competition that we will face
throughout the season.”
