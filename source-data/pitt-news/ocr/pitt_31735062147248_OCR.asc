Doug Fairbanks Acts As Extra--
In Free Fine Arts Movie Tonight up

Free tickets are still available for
“Intolerance” (1916), the third movie

in a series of a short survey of the
ﬁlm in America. in Room 107, State
Hall. The D. W. Griffith production,
sponsored by the department of ﬁne
arts, will be shown at 8:15 o’clock to-
night in the Falk -Elementary School
auditorium.

In this violent attack on injustice
and hypocrisy, Griffith has woven in
with a modern story of the wrongs in-
ﬁicted by a pious factory-owner on
his employee the cruelty of sixteenth
century Fra.nce, ancient Baby-lon, and
Calvary. The whole speaks of the
evil that the self-righteous have per-
petrated through the ages.

The four episodes are: The Girl,
the modern story; The Nazarene, the
Judean story; Brown Eyes, the
French story; and the Babylonian,
the.Mountain Girl. '

The modern episode, The Girl, -has
been toured throughout the USSR a-s
study-material for the post-revolution-

ary school of cinematography.

The ﬁlm is of extreme importance
in cinema history because it uses all
the old and many of the new technic-
al devices:——brief, enormous close-
ups; camera angles; tracking shots;
and rapid cross-cutting. »

Two years in the making, “Intoler-
ance" features Mae Marsh, Lillian
Gish, Monte Blue, Eric von Stroheim,
and Bessie Love.
taken by future stars Colleen Moore,
Carmel Myers and Alma Rubens.
Douglas Fairbanks and DeW0lf Hop-
per are among the extras.

The Dell/line of his day, Griffith uses
enormous sets, and mob scenes. The
huge set used for the Feast of Bel-
shazzar had to be ﬁlmed from a
balloon.

Assistant director was VV. S. Van
Dyke, now famous for his “Thin Man.”

A ﬁlm of unmistakable greatness
and originality, “Intolerance” is con-
sidered by many as Grifl‘ith’s greatest
work, rivaled only by his well-known
southern drama, “Birth of a Nation.”

Shows Wide Gain‘

Highest Level Since First Of Year
Is Reached, Bureau Reports

A pronounced gain in trade and a
moderate increase in originating ship-
ments for the last week of February
lifted the index of business activity in
the Pittsburgh district -to the highest
level since the ﬁrst week of January,
announced the Bureau of Business Re-
search.

The rise in trade was explained by
the Bureau as due to sharp increases
in department store sales and new
motor car registrations. It amounted
to a gain of 11.4 over the preceding
week and was the highest level reach-
ed by trade in the last ﬁve years.

Originating shipments owed their
sizable gain chieﬂy to the heavier
loading of coal and to some extent to:

Work On Stephen C.

Foste r Memo rial

Speeds Up; Fall Completion Expected

By Harold Hoffman

‘With the advent of a long-awaited
spring, work has again begun on the
Stephen Foster memorial, latest ad-
dition to the group of buildings on the
Frick Acres plot, scheduled to be com-
pleted by next fall.

Because of inclement weather, work
has been delayed on the memorial
since ear'y in the year. At the present
time, nearly all of the stonework on
both the main building and the adjoin-
ing shrine has been ﬁnished.

The roof of the octagonal shrine is
nearing completion and cement will
soon be poured over wood forms on
the roof of the main structure.

When completed, the auditorium
will, rise the entire height of the me-
morial. The ceiling of the ball will
be formed by a network of arched
beams, converging at a point near the
center.

The capacity of the auditorium will
be more than 1,000. Entrance to the
hall will be through doors in the rear
and at each corner. VVitl1 the staxce
as a base, the front of the auditorium
will be in the form of a large Gothic
arch. The stage itself will be about
55 feet wide, with ample room for all
necessary lighting and scenery. A
large orchestra pit will be provided.

The Forbes Street side of the build-
ing will contain a large foyer and
vestibule with stairs to the mezzanine
and the entrance to the Stephen Fos-
ter shrine. The shrine is apart from
the main bui'ding and is connected to
the hall by a passageway, lighted, by
stained-glass windows.

The shrine itself will be an actual
museum, where the objects connect-
ed with the life of the Pittsburgh com-
poser will be exhibited. Special cases
will be built in the wall for the col-
lection.

The mezzanine will lead to the bal-
cony which will cover the entire rear
of the auditorium and part of each
side. Above the stage, offices and a
board room will be located. Dressing
rooms, for use when plays are being
staged, along with properties and
costume rooms, will probably also be
provided.

The central room of the ground
floor will be the social room, design-
ed so that it can be used as a lotlnge
during intermission or as a meeting
room for organizations.

A large and complete kitchen will
be installed to cater to dinner meet-
ings. Small lounges and separate
men and women’s coat rooms will
also be located on the ground ﬂoors.

Tap For Two

Ol’l-IOMORES are rather lll,9,‘elllOllS people

S sometimes. This afternoon a group of sopho-

mores, Druids by name, is starting a new sys-

lzczn. of ta.ppin{.z inembers to their organization. at a

tea dance. People have been tapped in some odd

places previously, but memory does not recall that
the dance setting has been used before.

This. of course, is less to the point than that a
whole lot of tlic folks who will be dancing" there
this afternoon don ’t know what a. Druid is from a
sirin,<: beans. Only the most facetious will suggest
that :'t':: hard to tell.

On the books. the Druid org'aniza.tion is known
as an honora1‘_v activities fraternity for sophomore
men. lintil last. year, the society had followed a
svstem of tapping 12 men at the spring‘ activities
Tap .lla.,\' c.‘:ercises and three additional members
at the annual Druid smoker in the fall.

Last _vear"s Druids stepped up the quota. to 17,
by tapping two men in Februar_v. Now the policy
has been altered again to permit a total of 21 men
to be ‘tapped in any one year.

\’\.7hile the enla1'_<_:‘inp' of the Druid membership
may seem at ﬁrst to lake away some of the g'lor_v,
on second thought. the larger group has some dis-
tinct advantages. It is quite evident that with half
a dozen exceptions, there is little to choose among
a score of t'reslnnen who enter into activities.

llp until a short time ago. it was a widespread
contention that Druids was a group controlled by
fraternities: that contention was borne out to some
extent by the recollection of some t’cll0ws. now out-

there is alwavs a chance that some ‘fellows who are

New Library Books

By Richard Coop:er

Among the books received this week by the University
Library are several contemporary plays; some already
produced, some now running, and some yet to be pro-
duced. ‘

The most comprehensive of these is “The Eternal
Road,” by Franz VVerfel, author of “The Forty Days of
Musa Dagh.” This new drama, now in rehearsal under
the direction of Max Reinhardt, depicts the epoch of
the Hebrew race as it  recorded in the Bible. Trans-
lation of the text into English has been done by Ludwig
Lewisohn.

“Pa.rar.lise Lost,” recent Broadway success by Clifford
Odets. concerns the groping of the American middle
class for ﬁnancial security and new social values.

“First L-acly," by Katharine Dayton and George S.
Kaufman. is :1 satire on society in the nation’s capital
which recently opened in New York.

In addition to these original p1a_vs_ there are three
rlramatizations of famous novels.

The ﬁrst. “Pride and Prejudice." is an adaptation of
Jane Austen's 18th e€¢I1t1ll‘_\' novel by Helen Jerome, still
running on Broadway_

“Paths of Glory." by Sidney Howard, is taken from
the novel by Humphrey Cobb. and is rt repudiation of
militarisni. In the introduction Mr. Howard. who also
dramatized “Dodswort.h,” by Sinclair Lewis. expresses
the hope that this play will ﬁnd its way into college
tlieaters throughout the country.

“The, Old I.-acliesf’ by Rodney Ackland_ is an adapta-
tion of .1 novel by the English writer, Hugh Walpole.

’l‘wo ‘nooks on modern industry are “American Labor
Struggles," by Samuel ‘Yellen, and “Glances at Industrial
l‘?.esea1'ch." by Edward R. Vveidlein and William A.
Homer, of the Mellon Institute.

“American Labor Struggles." is an account of the
major labor disputes since 1877, from the Haymarket
strike\to the general strike in San Francisco in 1934.

“Glances at Industrial Research" explains the work
-zlone in the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research.

‘Depict Cultur;l_ Heritage’
Of Old World Nations
Aim Of illemorials

By John Martinco

Phases of the nationality rooms to
be built in the Cathedral are discuss-
ed and explained by articles, photo-
graphs, drawings, and statistics in the
February edition of The Alumni Re-
view, released Friday.

Featured is an article by Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mit.che1l, adviser on nation-
ality rooms, who presents a. general
survey of the situation. Mrs. Mitchell
explains that the classrooms “ha.ve
been planned in such a way that they
will, by decorations and furnishings,
speak to students of the beauty and
dignity of some period or place in
which men have lived their lives with
purpose and meaning.” On the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, where 17 rooms are available for
classroom purposes, the decoration
and furnishings of the rooms, accord-
ing to Mrs. Mitchell, will depict the
cultural heritage of old world coun-
tries which have been the birthplace
of many Pittsburghers. The selection
of the nations to be memoria.lized
was made after a ﬁve-year study of
the national origins of the entire stu-
dent body of the University.

Response Enthusiastic

After invitations from the chan-
cellor had been sent to representative
men and women to organize for the
purpose of ﬁnancing the rooms, the
response was instantaneous and en-
thusiastic, reports Mrs. Mitchell as
she presents a short history of plans
for the project. The ﬁrst committee,
the Italian, was organized in 1927 a.nd
the ﬁfteenth, the Swedish, in 1934.
The various. groups have sponsored
suppers, dances, and many other pro-

grams ranging from a French “Bal
Tabarin” to a Swedish “Smorgas-
bord.”

The nationality rooms adviser an-

nounces that the fust committee to
complete its fund is the Chinese
group. They have raised $4,000 in
this country, and that sum has been
greatly augmented by a $5,000 pledge
from the Chinese government to ex-
press appreciation of what American

education has meant to modern
China. The pledge was oft‘icia.lly
transmitted to the chancellor last
July.

Attorney Tabor Writes

“The interest of foreign govern-
ments iu the nationality rooms is a
noteworthy feature of the undertak-
ing,” says Mrs, Mitchell. She reveals
that in addition to monetary contribu-
tions, many nations have donated the
services of famous architects.

In another article, Edward 0. Ta-
bor, prominent Pittsburgh attorney of
Czechoslovak descent, writes on, “The
Signiﬁcance of the Nationality
Rooms." Mr. Tabor writes of the in-
terest with which persons of foreign
descent view the project. He declares,
“Greater than the material contribu-
tions themselves in the gift of spirit
and interest.” He refers to his peo-
ple, the Czechslovakiaus, who have al-
ready contributed more than $11,000.
This, he states, represents more in
human values than larger gifts of in-
terested individuals, because “almost
every dollar was given by ordinary
folks, plain people, work.ers, small
business men and home owners—often
at a sacriﬁce.”

Mr. Tabor cautions that in view of
the purposes and aims on the part
of the nationality groups, two
thoughts must be remembered and fol-
lowed. First, he states, “The Univer-

Alumni Review

Total First In Drive;

sity must ﬁnish the job that it has be-
gun, in a spirit matching that of those
who made contributions of time and
money.” In the second place, be de-
clares, “National backgrounds, racial
heritage, and ancient traditions must
be discovered, evaluated, and used in
the educational process.”

"Then follows a. description of the
classrooms. These will range from
the Chinese with its bedragoned walls
and teakwood ﬂoor to the Greek
Room, which will radiate the wisdom
of Socrates, and Aristotle. Besides
these two, there will be Czechoslovak,
English, French, German, Hungarian,
Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Rouman-
ian, Scottish, Swedish, Yugoslav
rooms.

Printed statistics show that the 15

committees have raised $128,734.65 of
a total‘ pledge of $200,000. Pictures
show sketches of several of the
rooms, pictures of committees, and a.
plan for the first ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral.
Answers Tax Questions

A contrasting article, "Beware of
the Ides of March,” by Robert A.
Ayars, instructor in accounting,
answers questions for the beneﬁt of
the bewildered persons who are ﬁlling
out their income tax returns. As
usual Robert X. Graham reviews the
University news, while John W. Hal-
lock, secretary of the General Alumni
Association, notes the activities on
the part of alumni groups. In addition,
the regulations for election of alumni
trustees are included in the maga-
zine.

Labor Diﬁiculties
Add To Problems
In Coal Industry

Although the problems of getting

coal during the cold spell may have
seemed important to some people, the
AE-ME seminar learned of other trou-
bles in the coal industry. According
to Dr. L. E. Young of the Pittsburgh
Coal Company, the labor problem is
also a momentous one.

Said the speaker, miners and opera-
tors are usually on friendly terms, but
they are bound to such a strict con-
tract that is practically impossible for
either party to reach an agreement
on a particular labor problem. This
is because “past practice” rulings
prevent the changing of former reg-
ulations.

In the operators’ favor is the ruling
that the miners can11ot go out on
strike without being ﬁned for doing
so. But miners can appeal this fine
and often have it revoked.

From the miners’ standpoint, ac-
cording to Dr. Young‘, the operator
should take all the risks, while the
miners should be allowed to share in
the proﬁts. Correlated with this is the
problem of machinery replacing men.
The union permits this, but feels that
the miners should share in any proﬁts
realized on the installation.

Dr. Young believes that machinery
should be used where it aids in pro-
duction of low-cost coal, because the
success of a coal ﬁeld lies with that
factor alone. Competition is severe
in the coal industry and the Western
Pennsylvania ﬁelds can stay in the
running only by efficient operation.
Incidentally, 70 per cent of the cost
of coa.l is the labor involved, and in
attempting to cut the cost the opera-
tors are confronted by the airtight
contract.

In connection with the machinery
question. Dr. Young also believes that
the operator should receive enough
to cover his investment, depreciation,
and a reasonable proﬁt; then, if any-

thing remains, he believes that the

miners should be considered in the
sharing of proﬁts. He added that this
is but human from a strict business
view, since the miners assume no re-
sponsibility in the operation of the
mine and consequently should receive
no more than a ﬁxed salary.

Since both the Ininers and the op-
erators must agree on pay and other
problems, either group can stall a
coal convention by refusing to come
to terms. Of: some 30 conventions
which have been held all but two
have re,su‘ted in wage increases for
the miners.

Dr. Young believes that an engineer-
ing student in the coal ﬁeld shou‘d
work first with the miners and then
work up.

Panthers Brave
Mountaineer Den
For Final Game

 

Pitt Victory Over West Virginia
Will Clinch Fourth Successive
League Title Wednesday

By William K. Trosen

“lay down there in the West Vir-
ginia hills, Dr. Carlson and his Panth-
er basketball team pull the curtain on
the 26th act of the 1936 season Wed-
nesday night, with W'est ‘Virginia
playing the opposing role in “The
Last Conference Game.”

According to critics, it's slated to
be one of those “hit” shows, for both
of the leading parts are taken by
tezfins that usually put on a grand
performance. Add this to the fact
that there is a bonus for the best act-
ors, it seems to be a “sure-ﬁre” hit.

W'ednesday night's show will be
the last of the season for the barn-
storming Panther troupe. Thus far,
the Cats have taken part in 25 per-
formances. In 18 of them, they were
selected the best group of actors, in-
cluding one previous get-together with
this same bunch of Mountaineers.

Pitt Won First One

That was many weeks ago, when
the Mountaineer cagers came to the
Stadium to meet the Panthers.
the time, the Panthers growled far
down in the conference standings,
while the lVest Virginia boys rode
high on top of the league, in a tie
with Carnegie Tech, Since then, the
scene has changed, with the Cats
purring comfortably in first place and
the Mountaineers in the fourth posi-
tion.

It's much too late for the Vvest Vir-
ginia gang to stand a chance for the
title, but there is one thing they
could do, and would enjoy doing, That
is to put a crimp in the Panther’s
plans for their fourth consecutive
conference title.

In the first game with the Panth-
ers, the Mountaineers took one on the
chin, 43-27. At that, they made quite
a game of it until their ﬁve regulars
tired, then the Panthers romped
away with the game. All season this
has been West Virginia’s biggest
fault. the inability to substitute good
players in order to give the varsity a
rest.

Dukes Were Upset

are all varsity men from last year,
and with Albie Colebank, look like
one of the best teams in the district.
Red Gocke is the conference's lead-
ing scorer, his 23 points with Penn
State recently boosting him away
above other individual league scorers.

Only a. week ago these ﬁve players
swept aside the “perfect” Duquesne
band-wagon down in Morgantown.
All of them must have left their dates
early the night before, for the entire
ﬁve played every minute of the game.
At that, they had enough left to stave
off a typical Duke rally and pull the
biggest siiprise of the local season by
sending the Dukes back to Pittsburgh
with their third defeat of the season,
35-33.

Mountaineers Are Tough

If the Panthers come through
against the Mountain boys this VVed-
nesday, it means another league
championship. If they lose to West
Virginia. the race will no doubt end
in a. tie between the Panthers and
Tech's Tartans, which means another
pla.V-off for the title. In this impor-
tant game, anything can happen, for
the Mountaineers are plenty‘ tough
anywhere, but on their own ﬂoor it

The Pitt News

Dr. Carlson Picks A ‘Long

Shot’

For His Biggest ‘Kick’ In Sports

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head basketball coach and genial director of
the men's student health service, goes way back to the 1927 cage season
for his “biggest thrill.”
Those were the golden days of Pitt basketball, when “Chipper”
Charley Hyatt, Paul Zehfuss, and Les Cohen, '.l.S sophomores, were ringing

up victories for the Panthers. Their
record of 19 straight triumphs over the
best teams in the East and Mid-West
led straight to a crucial ball game at
W'ashington with the Wash-J eff Prexies.

Notre Dame had come closest to
catching Pitt in that string, losing 22-
24. At the other extreme, Dartmouth
wound up on the short end of a 62-33
count as did Tech, 67-28. along with
many others by just as decisive mar-
gins. ‘

But to get on with the “kick,” ﬁve
seconds of play remained in that Pan-
ther-President clash when Red Kirk-
man let one ﬂy three-quarters of the
distance from the \V&J basket. Pitt
at the time, led by one point, 33-32
Red’s long shot hit the outside rim,
bounced straight up in the air, hung
crazily on the edge of the rim on the
rebound, and then slipped off into the
outstretched arms of a Pitt man as the
gun sounded to make it 20-straight for
the undefeated Cats.

That wild shot was certainly no
health-tonic for the “Good Doctor,” but
at the same time it gave him the big-
gest “kick" of his athletic career as

growing list by March 22. For that

According to this announcement
which comes from the office of Martin
J. Feely, director of Intramural ath-
letics, Herculean grips and grunts
will have their share of the Intra-

in _whi_ch students of any weight over
110 pounds have an opportunity to
acquire one of the gold, silver, or
bronze Intramural medals. There are
no requirements necessary, only a de-
sire to test muscles and mat strategy.
No previous experience whatsoever is
needed.

Eddie Mazeski, Pitt wrestling coach,
will likely be in charge of the festivi-
ties. At any event, he is willing to
hand out pointers on the grip and

forfeit by the Chem Specials to the
Oil Flashes. In the active wins, the
Chem Engineers romped away with a
40-23 triumph, while the Metallurgists
handed the O—Gees an 11-7 setback.
Chief point-making role was played

Irv Solow Tops
Ping-Pong Field
For Second Title

Champion Scores Repeat Victory
By Whipping William Brosius
In Four-Set , Title Match

By Leonard Levison

Irwin Solow ﬁrmly entrenched’ him-
self as University ping-pong champion
Friday by scoring a four-set victory
over Bill Brosius in the championship
round, 21-17, 21-19, 19-21, a.nd 21-11.

It was the ﬁnal match of the second
annual University Table Tennis Tour-
nament, culminating ﬁve hectic days
of competition, insured the maintain-
ence of the Solow dynasty for at least
another year and possibly two more
since Solow is only a sophomore.

As the scores indicate, the match
was closely contested. Both Solow
and Brosius had a brilliant array of
shots. In the ﬁnal reckoning it was
Solow’s greater consistency and con-
ﬁdence that served as the determining
factors.

VVhile Brosius kept the score even
throughout the beginning "of each
game, Solow usually spiirted to victory
in the home stretch drive. In the
first game he pulled away at 17-16,
and then went on to win, 21-17. With
the score 19-19 in the second game,
Solow whipped two points across the
table for a 21-19 victory.

Brosius won the third game by
piling up an early lea.d. Jumping
ahead, 6-0, Bill withstood Solow’s
closing drive to stay in front, 21-19.
In the ﬁnal match Solow’s seven-
point surge broke Brosius for the
match game, 21-11,

Solow’s road to the ﬁnals was not
so smooth as the one Brosius traveled.
In his ﬁrst contest, Solow had some
trouble with Kotler, 21-19, 24-22. En-
gelmohr, his quarter-ﬁnal opponent,
dropped a best-out-of-three-set match,
21-13, 19-21, and 21-13. Tommy Locke,
as his bracket semi-finalist, threw the
biggest scare into the Solow camp. He
captured the ﬁrst game, 19-21, after
which Solow rallied to cop the next
two, 21-16 and 21-16. ‘

On the other hand, Brosius encoun-
tered no trouble along his route to
the ﬁnals. He dropped only one
game, this a. 12-21 affair to Hamburg
in the semi-ﬁnals, at't.er which he re-
covered to smack out a 21-17, 21-8,
and 21-7 victory.

With 85 participants, there were 83
matches played totaling approximate-
ly 250 games over a period of ﬁve
days.

In Final Match

With only two days of practice re-
maining, Coach Eddie Mazeski is
putting the varsity mat squad through
some strenuous work in preparation

for the West Virginia match, sched-
uled for Wednesday night at Morgan-
town.

Coach Mazeski is dissatisﬁed with
the season's record and is eager to
win the ﬁnal match of the 1936 cani-
paign. By ironing out some of the
defects that have cropped up during
the season, Mazeski expects a com-
plete reversal of form against the
strong Mountaineer grappling team.

In the intercollegiate competition
this season, the Panthers dropped
ﬁve matches, losing to VVaynesburg,

Some Coeds Get Head Start
Long Before Sheepskin Day

By Ruth Rosenthal

Some coeds at the University are
working girls long before the'y~re-
ceive the. famous sheepskin, Miss
Isabelle Anderson, assistant dean of
women, who aids women students in
employment problems,'has just ﬁn-
ished a survey of the working girls
and their scholastic average. After
looking over the survey, she discover-
ed some believe-it-or-not facts.

Out of the 164 women employed
under the National Youth Adminis-
tration, 43 per cent improved their
grades over the previous semester.
Of the 24 per cent who lowered their
average, the majority dropped only
a tenth of a quality point.

The freshman women did surpris-
ingly well, what with unit‘ work and
trying to overcome the opinion of pro-
fessors. They must have done some
studying, because 33.1 per cent came
out of examinations with a B aver-
age. Only four per cent of the work-
ers made less than'a -C average, and
consequently had to be dropped.

According to Miss Anderson, the
conclusion to be drawn from this-sur-

vey is that those working under the
.NYA have learned to budget their
:time so as to make certain adequate
T_hours for studying French and Eng-
glish, joining in ' freshman activities,
gaswell as their ten hours a week of
2 work. '

The NYA is a federal grant to the
.University to aid students who give
lpromise of average or better-than-av-
erage scholarship. The work is given
,only to those women who have a 1.0
average. If this average is not main-
tained, the woman is dropped.

Students have been working as
clerks, tutors, waitresses at banquets,
nursemaids, and typists in their
spare time, according to an examina-
tion of the undergraduate Women’s
Placement Bureau, of which the NYA
is a part. Money received from such
employment is used to pay for tuition,
dues, lunch, and books.

Business seems to be improving, at
least in the graduate division of the
VVomen’s Placement Bureau_ This year_
more alumnae women were placed
than in the entire last three years.
The work secured was chieﬂy stenc-
graphical and statistical.
