Cape Town, South Africa — Standing on
the summit of Corcovado, I gazed down at
a visual wonderland both idyllic and urban.
The labors of both man and nature exist side
by side here in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where
skyscrapers lie in the shadows of massive
mountains and lush mists from the rainfor-
est spread out over the hillside neighbor-
hoods. A p

Corcovado provides ‘ the perfect
panoramic View of Rio’s size, topographical
diversity and sheer beauty. You can see the
ﬁngers of the rainforest stretching out in all
directions and the neighborhoods that have
sprung up in its valleys; the modern build-
ings of the various business districts; the
clear bays and beaches, and the grottos ris-

ing out of them Rio should be many cities, .

and seeing it as a visitor feels a lot like look-
ing down into a magical kingdom.
Did I mention Jesus was standing

‘behind me?

The Christ the Redeemer statue, a 115-
foot~high soapstone monument built in
1931, stands facing ‘east with outstretched
arms, welcoming visitors to the region. It’s
quite an imposing sight, but the real at1rac-
tion is watching all the tourists trying to get
a picture with him in the background. They
line up ﬁve—wide across the steps leading
down from the statue and mimic the famous
posewhile a companion snaps a picture.
But since there’s no_ oﬂicial method to the
madness, everybody gets in other people’s
way -— and pictures. -

 Protest calls for end to US. presence

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Staff Writer

A small group of eight protesters assem- E

bled Saturday on the ‘steps of the Software
Engineering Institute on Fifth. Avenue to
protest the continuing U.S. occupation of
Iraq.

The protest, organized by the Duncan
and Porter House of Hospitality and
Resistance, a Catholic Worker house in
Pennsylvania, was also in honor of the
approximately 400 Iraqi  who died
in a February 1991 U.S. bombing of an
Ameriyah shelter, located in a suburb of

B@dad. The Pentagon said U.S. troops

were not aware that civilians were hiding in

the A shelter, according to the Knight

Ridder/I‘ribune wire service. _ _
The SEI develops weaponry similar to

“ that used in the Ameriyah bombing, accord-

ing to the protesters. And because SEI is part

of Camegie- Mellon University, protester
Vincent Eirene, 51, said Carnegie Mellon
University students are trained and taught to
develop “new software to kill  the [United '
States’] enemy.” "

“We’re against the way young minds
aren’t even able to experiment with peace,”
Eirene said, adding that students could be
doing research on a cure for AIDS or solving
the homeless problem instead

“What I say is, we allow the people of
Iraq to establish their Own democracy"  A
[and] their own society the way they want
it,” Steven Donahue, 49, said into a mega-
phone. “When will we quit? It’s time to let

the people [of Iraq] deci .” .

Oneof the main objections to pulling
U.S. troops out of Iraqis the idea that Iraq
cannot handle a democracy on its own,
Eirene said. ‘ I ‘

Money requests

well exceed funds

ADAM FLEMING
V Staff Writer

. Student Govemment Board worked
late because more than 40 supplemental
requests for student organization budgets

‘ ﬂooded in at their weekly Thursday night

meeting.

The sudden inﬂux of applications.

could be largely attributed to an upcoming
allocations ' committee moratorium on

accepting requests. The moratorium will

last until the end of spring break

“We had roughly $95,000 in requests,
and we only had roughly $20,000 to give
out,” Board President Brian Kelly said

Friday. “We hit that mark almost exactly,

so in that regard I am happy.” .

Kellyadded thathe was saddened by
having to turn down “quality programs”
because of a lack of funds. ,

On several occasions, the ‘ president
voted to break a tie within the Board. Each
time he voted to accept the allocations
request. ‘ L .

“As a past member of the allocations
committee, I know the amount of time that
goes into making their recommendations,”
he said. “I listen to the committee greatly
and‘ appreciate their work.” _

. Allocations Committee Chair Joshua
Taylor said budgets will be released on
March.1. He said that, of the estimated
$700,000 spent in the entire budget,
approximately $500,000 was allocated in
the regular budgeting process and approx-
imately $200,000 will be used to ﬁll sup-
plemental requests, such as the Ones pro-
posed on Thursday. ,

In terms of ﬁscal responsibility,
Taylor said the Board granted $1,000
more than their goal of ‘$700,000, but he
added that the amount was easily manage-
able. '

Kelly seemed consistently cognizant
of the Board’s restraints.

“While it is very difﬁcult to look stu-
dents in the eyes and deny their requests, it
had to be done in order to remain ﬁscally
responsible,” he said. “I would love to
give every group that has a legitimate

Women strong in Panthers

ERIN CLARKE
Staff Writer

The words of 16-year-old J. Tarika
Lewis paved the road for women to join the
Black Panther Party.

“Y’all have a nice program and every- '

thing, it sounds like me. Can I join? Since
y’all don’t have no sisters up in here,” she
asked one day after walking into the Black

Panther headquarters in Oakland, California.

“Well, can I have a gun?” she asked

An aﬂirrnative answer to her questions
made Lewis the ﬁrst woman to join the
Pa1TY- ‘ I I
Women like J. Tarika Lewis and their
involvement in the Black Panﬂrer Party were

the subjects of a lecture given by Dr. Robyn

Cearme Spencer. The Women’s Studies
Department hosted her lecture, “Black
Power and Black Panther Women,” last
Thursday. Students, professors and commu-
nity members gathered in Room ZM56 of
Posvar Hall at 3 p.m. to listen to Spencer’s
work. A ’

Spencer’s lecture and presentation con-
veyed images of women taking an active
role in the Black Panther Party. Women did

‘ not allow the Black Power movement to go

along " without them. During the 1970s,
women began to join the Black Panther
Party, Spencer said They took active roles in
the party and changed the image that the
Black Panthers included only men.

“When people talk about the Black
Panther Party, they think ﬂrey’re talking
about men,” Spencer said

Popular images of the Panthers display
the group as having an all—male member-
ship, but the Black Panthers were the ﬁrst
organization to popularize the image of
black Women as armed insurrectionists,

Spencer said. They believed armed self

defense was a skill that women could master '

and pass down to ﬂreir children.

Black women were indispensable
central to the Black Panther Party. According
to co—founder Bobby Seale, three-fourths of
Black Panther members were women. As
mothers, these women taught their children
to be ‘combatants against injustice.

_ Though women took roles as clerical
workers and typists, moving up in the party
was encouraged, Spencer added Women
stepped up to take on leadership roles and
became involved in politics. \

Kathleen Cleaver was known for her
militant image and politics. Elaine Brown
took over the party when previous co-leader
Huey Newton went into exile, and Brenda

Pressley became involved at the urging of a _

young man who asked her to type some-
thing. When she leamed that it was for the
Black Panthers, Pressley agreed. She volun-
teered. a few days a week and soon became
a Black Panther member. , ‘

These women and many more were a
“crucial part in black Women’s struggle,”
Spencer said_ She believes that their stories
remain unknown because history often
omits militant wonien. ’

Even today, the “stereotype of a super-
strong woman tends to bedevil us,” she said

Spencer is an assistant professor of
African and African-American studies and
history at Penn State. She grew up in
Brooklyn, New York and graduated:-ﬁom
Columbia University in 2001 with a doctor-
ate in American History. This year, Spencer
is participating in a post—doctoral fellowship
at the Center for African-American Urban
Studies and the Economy at Carnegie

Mellon University. She has written about '

gender and black power, and the intemation-

. al impact ‘of the Black Panther Party.

Protest strong,
Protest, page 1

Although Eirene agreed thatit might
not be a smooth transition between govern-

ments, he added, ‘There will be’ civil. strife.

But it’ll be their civil strife, their country, and
tl1ey’ll be ﬁne.” '

Tim Vining, the executive director of
the Thomas Merton Center, said it was
important to reach out to all people, includ-
ing those who were initially supportive of
the war.

Americans have been “hoodwinked”
and lied to by the government, Vining said
“Saddam Hussein is gone. There are no
weapons of mass‘ destruction.”

The war is not a war about national
security, but about allowing multi—national
corporations access to Iraqi resources,
including oil, he said

“You can’t have a war  out of some
strange premonition ﬂrat something bad is
going to happen,” said Bill Rounsley, the

protesters say

only Pitt student to attend the protest, in ref-

- erence to President Bush’s preerrrptive attack

on Iraq, which was attributed to a stated fear
of terrorism. -

Although Rounsley, a senior at the
School of Social Work, acknowledged that.
the protest was small, he said it was impor-
tant “to get the Word out that people are
against ﬂre war.” »

, People think the anti—war movement
has tamed down, but it has not, he said

Local protests help citizens speak out
against not just the U.S. govemment, but
against any"‘local war machine,” like SE1,
Rounsley said

“Some people just drive by [SE1] and
see a big glass building,” he said. ”

Those driving by SEI Saturday seemed
to be generally unconcemed with the protest.
But there were shouts of “Beat it” and “Get
a job” ﬁom two passing cars. A woman also
honked her horn, smiled, and gave a
tlrumbs-up in support of the protest. '

cause as much money as they need; how-
ever, in our ﬁscal climate, it just can’t hap-

pen.”
Taylor credited the tightness of funds

' to a general increase in the amount of

money being asked for by each group,
accompanied by a slight increase in the
number of groups asking for money.

In 1999-2000, groups asked for
$495,000, according to Taylor. This year,
he said, they asked for $1.1 Inillion.

Kelly recommended that organiza-
tions look for funds from other outlets,
such as ﬁmdraising and a program run
through the provost’s ofﬁce, known as the

 

Student Leadership Through Service
Fund.

The Board will work with certain
groups to ﬁnd alternative ﬁmding sources,
Kelly said, before he asserted another
potential solution to the problem.

“Last night was living proof that the
student activities fee needs to be raised,”
Kelly said. “We would have been able to
ftmd many of the programs we had to cut
if .we would simply have more money to
spen .”

The issue of raising the student activi-
ties fee, a portion of every student’s tuition
given to student organizations, will reach
the Board in two weeks. There will not be
an SGB meeting this week.

swagger of its musical namesake, while

Copacabana failed to deliver ﬂie sort of
party promised by Barry Manilow — per-
haps not surprising, considering the song
was Manilow’s. With its long, curvy swath
of white sand and massive waves, Ipanema
was where the kids came out to play. A cou-
ple bucks can get you a beach chair, enough
ice—cold Skol, the local brew, to have you
dancing the samba in the sand, and a ﬁont-
row seat at the world’s best beach party.
Thnongs of beautiful Brazilians bake in
the sun and play soccer, while vendors ped-
dle their wares from shoulder bags. The air
is ﬁlled with the smell of sand and grilled
meats, and the sounds of laughter and giddy
Portuguese. Say what you will about “wast-
ing” your day away on the beach when in a

foreign country — it has to be one of the V

best ways to get an authentic taste of local
culture. I learned more about Rio on the
beach at Ipanema than at any tourist-trap
monument or gift shop.

But the beaches are only‘ one facet of
this city. The romance of the sand directs
attention away from some of the more
socially sobering features of Rio de J aneiro.
The ghettos, or favelas, of Rio stand as

‘ reminders of the staggering division of
_ wealth that exists in this metropolis. They

are hard to miss. The favelas leer at you
from the hillsides as you make your way to
the beach or market They cower on the out-
skirts of the wealthiest neighborhoods and
sprout up around the highways like weeds.
They are breeding grounds for drugs, prosti-

tution and general misery, and one-third of .
Rio’s population lives in them. Not the peo-

ple we saw at the beach, presumably. _
The history is too complicated to

» recount, but a lasting colonial legacy, ~

migrant labor from the countryside, political
corruption and the drug trade have all had a
hand in creating these communities of social
strife. And while Brazilians will tell you that
steps are being taken to improve the’ quality‘
of life in ﬂiefavelas, it is difficult to imagine
what sort of measures could be taken to
eradicate such sweeping and densely con-
centrated poverty. A

It will also be interesting to see what the

' Brazilian government plans to do with the

shantytowns when the Olympic‘ Games
come to Rio in 10 years. Stray glimpses of
these neighborhoods will not be good for the
city’s image.

How do you spend three days in one of
the world’s largest and most dynamic cities?
However you do, you’ll leave with a heavy
heart, feeling like you’ve only scratched its
surface — feeling like you’ve only gras T
a fraction of its mystery. ‘

Jonathan Check is the foreign correspon-
dent for The Pitt News. In an eﬁort to appear
more Brazilian, ‘he forsook all sunscreen
while on’ the beach at Ipanema. He then
spent two ﬁrll days in bed with the worst sun-

burn of his life. He reminds you to use SPF '
30 when trudging through the snow and to '
e-mail hint at Jonnycman @ hotmail. com.

Keeping technological tabs on Junior

The digitalage is forcing snoop-

. happy parents into uncharted territo-

ry.

.It’s also forcing software makers
to keep up, and they are happy to
oblige.

Software now exists that allows

parents to monitor what Web sites a~

child visits. Tracking software
allows a parent to see both sides of a
child’s Instant ~Message conversa-
tions from a remote location — such
as a work computer — and, if the
conversation begins to worry the par-
ent, to block the exchange. Thereare
tracking-devices that can be inserted
into cell phones that_ alert parents
when a child leaves the house with
the phone.

Kids know when they are trusted,
and when they are not. Traditionally
more tech‘-savvy than their parents,

, today’s_ teens will be able to tell if

they are being spied on; when that
happens, they’ll resent their parents
even more, which will inevitably

“ lead to more of the kind of behavior

parents are looking to prevent with
their spying. '

How much further will such
developments go? It’s creepy to con-
sider an extrapolation of’ this techno-
logical trend. How long before
Junior gets a bar code imprinted" on

- his neck and has to scan to leave the
house‘? There will be no boundaries ‘

on tracking technology, as time
marches forward. '

Along with being generally
unsettling, the advent of these tech-
nologies is one step further in the
erosion of parental responsibilities.
Before the Internet spawned new
ways to misbehave, ‘- parents
impressed values upon their children
in decidedly low-tech ways — like
talking, ,or leading ' by example.
Instead, parents can put off telling
Susie why it’s bad to talk to strangers
in chat rooms until after they catch
her in the act + which is a lopsided
way to teach anyone anything.

. ‘And what’sthe next step? If a kid
sneaks around tracking software —
which she will — and meets up with
some shady characters with awful
results,‘ will the parents sue the soft-
ware company? It’s a question of
when, not if. I «

Even more unsettling islhacking
on the opposite end. Who is to say
that the perverts this software is
meantto protect kids from won’t use
the same programs to stalk ‘their
prey?  

Kids found trouble before the

Internet, and they will continue to do .

so. Parents need to stop relying‘ on
technology to keep their children
safe. They need to step up and adhere
to the job description" they accepted
as soon as they became parents. '

Where have all the lonely hearts gone?

Dear Sex ‘N’ at:

As everyone knows, Saturday was
Valentine’s ‘Day, the day that couples love
almost as much as singles hate. This is the
daythathasbeenascourgetomealmost
every year. This year, however, was going to
be diﬂ’erent. This year, I am of
legal age. This year, I was
going out. After all, if you’re
single and you don’t hit the
bars on Valentine’s Day, when
do you? Better yet, all the
“attach ” girls would be out
with their sweetie, thus saving
me the time of ﬁnding out
which ones had boyfriends.
Where were all the girls? After
starting ‘at Bootleggers and
Pittsburgh Cafe and seeing a p \
grand total of one girl that was
not within 10, feet of her

. boyfriend, we wound up at Hem_ingway’s.
There, we found triple the single women of

the prior establishments. There were plenty

of single guys, but no gals. Are there really ’

only ﬁve single girls on this entire campus
who are 21 or older ?Where are all the girls?
The Dear Hunter

Dea_rDear".

While your efforts were valiant, they
were doomed from the start. It was
Valentine’s Day, dude! What were you
thinking? If you had scored, or even gotten
so much as a fake cell number, you’d belong
in some kind of Hall of Fame somewhere.
Single women do not go to bars on
Valentine’s Day to meet bar-guys. Single

’ women band together on Valentine’s Day,

existing in enclavesof “Sex and the City”
rerunsandwine1hatdidn’tcomefromabox.
Or they go to bars in packs, determined to
avoid the male species entirely. '

Once, a few years ago, I went to a bar
while single on Valentine’s Day. This was,

meet at the bar? Seriously,
Valentine’s Day is a high-pres-
sure situation. Everyone who is
single is either openly miserable
or valiantly pretending that ‘_‘it’s
just another day on the calen-
dar.” Everyone is acutely aware
 “ of their single—hood on
- Valentine’s Day, more so than

any other day of the year. Sure,

okay, there are well-adjusted

singles who really don’t give a
hoot about the day or their status, but let’s be
honest —— they are in the minority.

Lots of singles like to spend Valentine’s
Day together, happily or angrily wallowing
in their lack of a mate. Ifthey are at bars, they
are already with the people in whose com-
pany they wish to spend the evening.

And if they are wallowing angrily or
sadly, it’s likely they’ll decide to escape the
charming South Oakland pub scene and per-

‘haps treat their wounded souls to revelry in

theland ofthe $9mar1ini—Ispeal<,of
course, of Shadyside. Here’s something else
to ponder. Not all coupled-up folks love
Valentine’s Day. In fact, many dread the
pressure of creating a perfect evening with
their sweetie, or picking the right gift. Low-
carb chocolates seemed so right in the store!

Go forth unto the bars, my Dear. Just
don’t do it on the most high—st1ess relation-
ship day of ﬂie year next time!

Complexities of Arab-Israeli
conflict greater than one column 1

Dear Editor:

Kevin Funk’s column published
on "Feb. 11 presents many disturbing
facts regarding the complexities of

- the Arab-Israeli conﬂict. Yet the num-
bers he puts forth do little justice to
the reality of Israel’s situation. He
condemns the military aid Israel
receives from the United States, but
has no problem with the same military
aid the United States and Europe are
supplying to the Palestinians ‘each
day. g .

He bemoans the Palestinian casu-

alties, but neglects to mention that,
every day, 12 to 18 suicide bombers
are stopped at the checkpoints at “the

Fence.” Moreover, Mr. Funk fails to

mention that the thousand or more

Israelis dead from the Palestinian war

are overwhelmingly women and chil-

dren who were murdered in their"

homes, schools, cafes and shopping
malls. This stands in stark contrast to
the Palestinian war dead, of which the
overwhelming majority of the casual-

ties include military combatants, ter-
rorists and homicide bombers, and
yes, to a lesser (though no less tragic
extent) innocent civilians who were
unfortunately too close to the combat
zone that Arafat has inﬂicted on his
people. The blood ‘indeed flows on
both sides, but while Israelis are tar-
geting military combatants and terror-
ists, the Palestinians are almost exclu-
sively targeting Jewish civilians.
What should be learned from Mr.
Funk’s article is there is a lot of bad
information out there, and a lot of

"newspapers willing to publish it. This

isn’t something you are going to
understand afterreading one column.
Only when people understand 311
sides will there be a peaceful solution
to the Arab-Israeli conﬂict.

Dear Editorzy . 

Taking responsibility. for one’s

actions and for the consequences that
flow from those actions is critical. It
is a point that Kevin Funk missed in
his diatribe against Israel in The Pitt
News. His mean-spirited, offensive
column fails to acknowledge the need
to take responsibility and fails to dis-
tinguish between acts of terrorism and
actions taken to stop terrorism.

Comparing terrorism, the deliber-
ate targeting of innocent civilians,
with defending one’s country by tak-
ing retaliatory actions against groups
that have killed innocent children and
families, is not only abhorrent, but
also indefensible.

Israel has decided to build a secu-
rity fence to keep out or deter the ter-
rorists. This is not a permanent bor-
der. This is not Israel’s initiative. The

-security fence is the fence that we

could say Hainas built. It is. a reaction
of a country to its people’s call for

security in their daily lives. It ‘is a

changeable and temporary solution to
very legitimate security concerns. V V

’ 1 Israel has a moral,-. historic and
innate "right to exist, and the 60-year

. battle) by those, who find a Jewish
state in the Middle‘ East unacceptable

will not erase that right. Israel as a
Jewish homeland is neither an artiﬁ-

cial nor a 20th-century creation. For

more than 5,000 years, Jews have
lived and maintained Jewish life in
Israel. The’ “creation” of the state by
the United Nations was recognition
by the world of the Jewish state’s per-
manence and legality. Since 1948,
certain Islamic fanatics have done
everything to destroy Israel militarily.
Having so far failed to destroy the
state of Israel militarily, the effort to
“demonize Israel” to death has begun.

It is time to learn how to discuss
difficult issues without demonizing
one side, and it is deﬁnitely time to
demand that the Palestinian leader-
ship take responsibility for their cam-
paign of terror. ‘‘

Auditioning for adulthood inahand-me-down suit  

Last summer, while I was home
doing my standard routine of working at
the pool and hitting up the beach on my
days off, I got a rousing lecture from my
dad. I’ll spare you the details of this half-
hour, life—altering experience. Basically,
what it boiled down to was that if I did-
n’t get an internship and do something of
value with myself the next summer, I
was going to end up a waste of life with
no future, working at the pool until I was
65. .

Fearing the wrath of my father, I
spent a good chunk of the first semester getting my
resume together and applying for various intern-
ships. Believe it or not, a few places I applied to
actually called me back to request an interview. The
first one was scheduled for about a week after
Christmas break.

My first real interview! Naturally, the first thing‘

that came to my mind was, “What am I going to

’ wear?” I thought this was going to be a great excuse

to get my parents to buy me some new clothes — for
the sake of professionalism, of course. Once again,
this situation proves that my and my parents’ trains
of thought run on "different tracks, entirely. Icame
back to Pittsburgh with my sister’s black business
suit tucked under my arm along with a great new
pair of black boots that I gleefully purchased on sale.

Somewhere in the midst of applying and getting
ready for this little rite of passage,'I confused the
idea of going on an interview with playing a big
game of dress-up.

I scurried around my apartment the
morning of the big day getting dressed
and made up in my most capable-looking
ensemble. When I finished and looked in
the mirror to see the results of my
efforts, I nearly fainted. Good Lord, I

‘switch from my typical winter uniform
of jeans, T—shirt, and. whichever hoodie
happens to be at the top of the pile in my
closet.

I stared back at my alter ego won-
dering who the hell I was going to fool in
this get-up. They were going to see right through me

— I knew it! There was no way I was going. to come

across as intelligent, mature, and impressive. I still

wear my retainer to bed every night, for God’s sake.

Time was ticking, so I had to suck it up. I com-
posed myself and decided to View this interview as
an audition in which I was trying out for the role of
the sleek and capable professional. I survived theQ-
and-A session —— I thought it went well. “Well,” see-
ing as I had absolutely no basis for comparison other
than what I’d seen on television. I went back to my
apartment and called home to report back to my
family. After answering no fewer than 5 billion
questions from them‘, I threw my suit on my bed, got
into my pajamas and tank top, and settled back into

a lifestyle in which I was much more comfortable:

that of a college student.

The Graffiti Rock Challenge moved through
the second night of" the semi-finals with a much
better night of music than the week before. Only
three bands took the stage on night two, a first for
the 18-year-old showcase. The fourth band
stepped down, not following through with the con-
tract agreed upon when it was accepted.

In its 18th year, the Graffiti Rock Challenge
has helped some big names in local music" along
with their career. Past winners include The Buzz
Poets, Mercury, Soda Jerk and Brownie___Mary, and
notable runners—up include The Clarks and Rusted
Root.

One hundred twenty-one bands submitted
recordings to be evaluated, were narrowed down
to 16 bands, which then compete in four semifinal
night. One band from each semifinal night makes

‘ it to the final competition. The winner will receive

a multitude of prizes, including studio time, per-
formances on the air with 105.9 WXDX and 102.5
WDVE, and a CD release party at Mr. Small’s Fun
House.

The Valentine’s night of rock started off with
The Patrick Maloney Band. PMB is a four—piece
that played an acoustic brand of rock that was
inspired by classic rock acts like Tom Petty and
The Rolling Stones. And speaking of The Rolling
Stones, front man Patrick Maloney sounded a lot

like Mick Jagger and even referred to his guitar
player as his “own, little Keith Richards.”
Playing mellow rock and singing songs about
love and feeling blue, they picked up speed and
energy toward the very end of their set with a song
titled “Se_1cre,_;t‘ Trove,” a quick and energetic song

The Patrick Maloney Band didn’t have a lot of
support from the crowd in attendance,
which was rather small to begin with, but
they did pull in some audience approval
toward the end of the set, which is
always heartwarming.

  Week two missed one band, still rocked

sound from what had already taken‘ the stage.

A shave, haircut, new
hip-hop at this ‘shop

Barbershop 2: Back in

Business Soundtrack
Various Artists

Interscope Records
skits}

As funky and entertaining as the
atmosphere inside the barbershop,
the soundtrack to “Barbershop 2:
Back in Business” is a mix of R&B
and hip-hop that would enhance any

collection. With the movie as a con-
venient opportunity to put all these
artists and songs together, the album
showcases both well-established tal-
ent and a couple of newcomers.
Almost every track on the sound-
track has potential to be a single with
serious radio airtime. The album
embraces the popularity of R&B-
infused hip-hop in today’s listening
audience with almost every song
being a variation on that style. Mya
has an up—tempo remix of “Fallen,”
one of the singles from her newest
release, Moodring. The song features
Chingy, adding; his response to
Mya’s . declaration of love. Other

R&B and hip-hop collaborations

include Morgan Smith and 3LW,
Mary J. Blige and Eve, Floetry and
Mos Def, as well as Mya making a
second appearance, this time with

_Sean Paul.

, With no unifying theme among
the songs, anything goes for the
songs on the album. Most of the
songs have little to do with each

“other and may seem. strangely

arranged on the album. “Pussy,”
Clispe’s lukewarm threat to whoever
might want to challenge the group,
seems rather mediocre compared’ to
the next song, “Never,” by Keyshia
Cole and‘Eve, -a soulful track that

makes great use of "a Luther Vandross A

sample for the beat. Accompanied by
G—Unit, 50 Cent makes an appear-
ance for the track “Unconditionally,”
a love song that’s fit for a gangsta.

Sleepy Brown and Outkast collabo- A

rate for a unique hip-hop song, “I
Can’t Wait,” that’ll be‘ enjoyed by

the past. g
, Only one song on the soundtrack

is a ‘tribute to the actual movie.»

“Barbershopff by D-12, brings the
rap group out of their ,pill—popping

anyone who liked Ou_tkast’s work’ in. -

past to celebrate barbershops and the ~

conversations that happen inside
them amidst the haircutting, in this

‘ light-hearted song.

Overall, the songs on Barbershop

entertaining, enjoyable and a good~

mix of the hip-hop talent out there
today. It’s definitely worth a listen.

ing dark clothes and mixing a nice
amount of heavy screams and rap
verses sung with angst and power.
They fit the image of teen-age angst,
letting go in a mosh pit, but their
sound wasn’t as tight as it could have
been. Some transitions were a little
sloppy at times, but it wasn’t a huge
factor in their performance.

They had a great stage presence,
with each member really getting into
the music; at one point, the‘ guitar
players — there were two of them —
were both banging along with the
music, bent over their guitars and
jumping around the stage. The front
man was a presence, besides being a
big guy who held his own on stage.
They had what it takes in the music
industry if only they were in this
contest four or five years ago. , V

One factor that is judged is
industry potential. That was on of the
factors, along with originality and
songwriting ‘ability, A that kept

Mushcup from taking the night. They
fell 12 points short of Mark Scheer

and the Discount Stars in what was a .

very impressive night of rock music.

Mark Scheer and the Discount
Stars had the presence on stage, as
did Mushcup, but with slightly more
originality and better lyrics; Scheer
held his own and put himself and his
Discount Stars into the final compe-
tition, along with last week’s winner
Alisium, on March 13.

Find out who will be the next
band to make the finals when

J aron Brown looks to make a move to thegbaskiet during the Panthers’ 75-68 victor

the Panthers in scoring, racking up 17 points while also dishing out six assists.

KEVIN. NASH
Assistant Sports Editor
One team had to go on its first los-
ing streak of the season, and the Pitt
that it would not be the one. 

Both Pitt and Connecticut were
coming off of road losses, and neither
team had-lost back-to-back games all
season. The No. 4 Panthers (23-2 over-
all, 9-2 Big East) avenged an earlier
loss to the No. 5 Connecticut Huskies

 —. menfslgasketball tearn was determined

with a 75-68 victory before a sellout

crowd at the Petersen Events Center on
Sunday afternoon.

“We knew [that] both of us were

coming off of losses and ‘[that] whoev-
er lost would be on a losing streak,”
Pitt forward Jaron Brown said. “We
didn’t want it to be us.” ' '
UConn (19-5, 7-3) spent the
majority of the game playing catch—up
as Pitt jumped out to an early 9-2 lead.
The Panthers drew first blood and
never trailed in the game... Freshman
center Chris Taft put in the first points
with a layup, which was followed by a

V basket from UConn’s Denham Brown

to knot the game at two.

/.

Following Denham Brown’s bas-
ket, Huskies’ -head coach Jim Calhoun
was hit with a technical foul.’ Pitt guard
Carl Krauser, whoiscored 13 points, hit
both free throws, which appeared to
give the Panthers momentum and a
lead that they never would relinquish.

“I think that when [U Conn] got the
tech, it gave us the momentum,” J aron
Brown said. '

Pitt proceeded to go on a 5-0 run in
which guard Julius Page nailed a three-
pointer and J aron Brown hit a field
goal. With the Panthers ahead 9-2, the
Huskies went on a run of their own,
scoring six points compared to Pitt’s
two.

UConn , forward Josh Boone
sparked the run by nailing both of his
foul shots, which were followed by
layupson the Huskies’ next two pos-

sessions by Emeka Okafor. Panther‘

forward Mark McCarroll, who scored
15 points, hit a jumper in between
Okafor’s layups-.

After Okafor’s second layup, Pitt’s
lead was 11-8. Page nailed his second
three-pointer of the game to put the
Panthers ahead"°,14-8. But UConn’s

Ben .Gordon answered back at the

ygover Connecticut on Sunday. Brown led

other end with a basket from down-
town.

The Panthers followed Gordon’s
three-pointer “with a 7-0 run.
McCarroll was responsible for all
seven points during the run; he hit a
three pointer to start the run. Krauser
hit McCarroll with a quick inbound

_ pass, which he dunked to give Pitt an
-eight-point cushion.

Following a missed basket on
UConn’s _next possession, Krauser
dribbled' down the ﬂoor on a fast
breedi. He laid the ball in the basket
and the ball popped out of the basket.
But McCarroll was right there to tip

the ball back in the hoop. _ .

“I came out and tried to play hard.
Chevy [Troutman] was in foul trouble,
so I tried to come in and give the team
energy,” McCarroll said. “I take shots
when I’m open.”

UConn was able to get within five
points before halftime, but Pitt fin-
ished the half on a 5-4 run to give it a
36-28 halftime lead.

The Huskies came out in the sec-
ond half and scored the first four

Who is the
face of
basketball?

 

In college sports, players leave
before a school or city even gets to
know them. At the most, a college ath-
lete is on the roster for ﬁve years --
counting a redshirt year. Therefore, it is
not the players that represent the sport,
like say a Michael Jordan in basketball,
or Babe Ruth in baseball.

The ﬁgurehead in college football
might just be Lee Corso, or maybe it’s
Bobby Bowden. However, in college
basketball there is no denying_the ﬁg-
urehead of the sport is Dick Vitale. He
exempliﬁes everything that college bas-
ketball stands for. When Vitale is at
your school, you know that the program
has reached national respect.

At the beginning of the season,
Vitale was not schedule to come to Pitt.
But just last week, Vitale chose to come
watch the marquee game of the week
— Pitt vs. Connecticut. ,

Sunday, Pitt happened to be the
place where Dickie V found out he is on
the ballot for the college basketball Hall
of Fame this year. Vitale was told this
news by his broadcast partner Brent
Musburger during the telecast. Vitale
broke down in tears.

His love and passion for the game
of college basketball are unprecedent-
ed. He represents a sport Where players
are not paid and there are no labor dis-
putes. For more than 20 years, Vitale
has enthused fans with his various say-
ings during a game. But, while he is
amazing on the rrxicrophone, it is away
from the television that makes Vitale

,even more impressive.

Vitale walked. into the Petersen
Events Center on Sunday for the second
time ever. Everywhere he went, press
and fans bombarded him, looking for an
autograph or a picture or a good quote.
Needless to say, he signed for everyone,

Panthers extend streak
to 40 wins at home

J 01-: MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

For 39 straight games, the
Panthers had walked off of their
home court with another tally in the
Win column. , _

On Sunday afternoon against
Connecticut, the men’s basketball
team did everything it could to make
sure that the streak would extend to
40, knocking off the Huskies and
taking sole possession of first place
in the Big East. «

The win places Pitt in the dri-
ver’s seat to capture its third straight
Big East regular season champi-
onship, its second straight Big East
Tournament title, and its first ever
No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament.

While it usually is not a good
idea to look too far ahead, the
Panthers knew how important this
game was. ' ’

“We knew this is a game we
would need,” said senior guard
Julius Page. “It was a very big, game
towards the end of the season and we
knew it was a step towards a No. .1

seed [in the tournament].”

In front‘ of the largest crowd to
ever witness a Pitt home game —
12,817 filled the Petersen Events
Center — the Panthers did not disap-
point. After both teams were tied at
two in the opening minutes of the
game, Pitt would not relinquish the
lead, and UConn would get no clos-
er than four points beyond the 12:20
mark of the first half. ,

Although players on the court
ultimately determined the final out-
come, the capacity crowd let the
players know that they were there.

“With the way our crowd was, I
normally don’t hear] them,” Page
said, “but tonight, I was able to hear
them. Everybody is buying into the
program.” K ‘

UConn head coach Jim Calhoun,
who was recently named a finalist
for induction into the college basket-
ball Hall of Fame, is one of those
people. V

“This is a great environment to
play in,” he said. “We’re fortunate
that they are in our league. They’re

Atmosphere and winning streak at thePete impress Vitale

Goldman, page 11

and spoke to every reporter. ,

One hour before game time, Vitale
did promos for the game. Not one, not
two, but about 60 different promos for
different cities around the country he
recorded and not once did he need a sec-
ond take. "

Then it was time to mingle with the
crowd, a tradition Vitale has become

accustomed to. He always talks to stu- _

dents and has his picture taken with the
crowd. ‘

Vitale said that he has gained a
great appreciation for the Petersen

during Pitt’s win.

 

Events Center and for the Pitt program
in general. He was impressed with what
he saw and believes Pitt has what it
takes to go all the way this year.

A “[Pitt] can ﬂat out beat anybody,”
Vitale said. “There are about 12 teams,
that can beat [Pitt] but they can beat
anybody on any given day. There is
nobody out -there that you can say will
blow [Pitt] away. Not Duke — none of
those teams.”

Vitale said that he was . also
impressed with the atmosphere in the
Pete. Winning for the 40th straight time
at home might have something to do

_ with that.

“[The atmosphere in the Pete] is as
good as it gets with the Oakland Zoo
going bananas,” Vitale said. “Winning
40 in a row leads to a great environ-
ment. With all the kids into it, it gives
such a great impetuous and adrenaline
to a team. I think it leads to a better
effort. The atmosphere makes you play
harder defensively. It makes you
rebound better. All the physical attribut-
es come out with the crowd cheering
you on.”

Vitale left the Petethe exact way he
came in — with a smile on his face —

and signed thousands of autographs for.
fans who had been waiting outside in

the cold for one peek at college basket-
ball’s premier name.

Now it’s on to another game and
another city for Vitale. But for one day,
Pitt stood out above the rest of the
nation as the place to be for college bas—°
ketball. The atmosphere was great, the
game was great, but Vitale was here to
complete the national attention given a
Pitt basketball program that four years
ago wouldn’t have even dreamed of a
day like Sunday. '

points of the half with baskets from
Denham Brown and Gordon respec-
tively. Pitt Forward Troutman scored
its first basket of the half, which put it
ahead 38-32. ‘

UConn would stick around until
Okafor went to the bench with his

, third foul with 11:39 left in the game.

Pitt would proceed to go on a 10-0 run
with Okafor on the bench.

During the ﬁnal 20 seconds of the
game, the Huskies pulled within five
points with the help of clutch three-
point shooting by Rashad Anderson
and Gordon along with missed free
throws by the Panthers. But Page and
McCarroll each nailed two free throws
to close out the game.

Huskies’ head coach Jim Calhoun
remembered how Pitt fell behind early
in the teams’ first meeting, but was

able to battle back and take UConn
down to the final shot. Calhoun
thought that UConn may have been
able to do the same thing.

“We had moments today when I
thought we might come back,”
Calhoun said. “They were a little
tougher and better at executing their
offense.”

Gordon led all scorers with 23
points, and Jaron Brown led the
Panthers with 17 points. Okafor scored
16 points but grabbed only six
rebounds. Dixon credits Pitt’s team
defense for limiting Okafor’s success.

“I don’t think that you ever can
take if guy as good as he is out of his
game,” Dixon said. f‘It comes down to
team defense.”

Pitt is next in action at West
Virginia on Feb. 21. Tip—off is set for 7
p.m., and the game will be televised on
Fox Sports Net.

Calhoun hopeful for one more meeting

Streak, page 12

thebest team in our league  I hope

we have the opportunity to play them‘

in New York [in the Big East
Tournament] .”

Pitt has not lost at home since
Jan. 12, 2002 —— a streak that is cur-
rently the longest_ in the nation. The
Panthers have also not lost back—to—
back games since that season and
avoided doing -so by pulling out the
win.

Like with many of the previous
39, the Panthers, picked up the win
by playing solid defense and spread-
ing the ball around. Despite getting
out-rebounded, Pitt had four players
score in double figures and held
UConn to 42.9 percent shooting
from the field. -

“Their -defense made the greatest
impression on me,” Calhoun said.
“Their inside defense stopped -us
from getting into our [game]. They
took us out of our offense.”

'Although UConn center Emeka
Okafor had 16 points and grabbed
six rebounds, Calhoun felt that the
Panthers — led by forward Chevon
Troutman — were able to keep him
in check. ‘

“That’s the best job of defending
I’ve ever seen on [Okafor],” said
Calhoun. “They wore us down. I
mean, we weren’t tired, but they
were a little tougher and better at
executing their offense.” ‘

Despite the postseason implica-
tions that the matchup had, Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon and his team
know that they still have a lot left to

' do to accomplish the goals they set

at the beginning of the season.

“I don’t think they’re going to
give _us two wins for this one,”
Dixon said. V

“Everybody brings something
different to the table,” Page added.

1 ‘‘We’re not going to back down from

anybody and do whatever it takes to
win. [But].on any given night, any-
one.can lose.” -

Although none of the Panthers
would say whether or not they’d like
one more shot at the Huskies in the
Big East Tournament, Calhoun was
more open with his thoughts.

“I’d love to be able to see
Pittsburgh again on a Saturday,” he
said referring to the Big East final.
“I think thatboth teams would want
to see anybody on that‘ Saturday
night.”
