STUDENT GOVERNMENT

NEWS

Board looks to ﬁll open position, sets Tuesday application deadline

Abbey Reighard
Staff Writer.

The Student Government Board is seek-
ing applicants.

The Board must fill a vacant seat
after former Board memberjake Radzi-

won announced his resignation Thurs- .

day to focus on “matters concerning the
personal affairs, relationships and as-
pirations that [he] _so deeply revere[s].”
Radziwon said he plans to focus more
on his roles as a member of the SGB
Recreation Committee and a student
representative to the University Senate
Athletics Committee.~

Board President Mike Nites moved
the weekly public meeting, usually held
on Tuesday nights, to Sunday night.
The Board will holdpublic interviews
for prospective candidates Tuesday at
8:45 p.m. in Nordy’s Place of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, according to Nites.

About 15 people attended the meet-
ing last night.

According to Nites, seven students
have applied for the position since he
made the applications available on the
SGB website Thursday night. He added
that if there are not at least 10 appli-
cants by Tuesday's 6 p.m. deadline, he
will extend the deadline and interviews
to after spring break.

“I understand that it’s not a lot of
time,” Nites said. “I’m comfortable with
that as long as the number of applica-
tions is high.”

Training would be conducted over
spring break through Skype, or in
person ifthe new Board member is on
campus, according to Nites.

Nites said he will not release the
names of the candidates until the pub-
lic interviews Tuesday and will give
the names of the candidates to Board
members about an hour before the in-
terviews. .

Katie Epner, a sophomore informa-
tion sciences major and president of
Pitt Ski and Snowboard Club, plans to
submit an application to the Board.

Epner said her project ideas include
healthier food options and listing nu-
trition facts of on-campus dining loca-—
tions, but she has organizational goals
as well. '

“One of my main [goals] is to in-
crease the interaction between students
and the student government,” Epner
said. » T
Epner said she didn’t run for a Board
position during last semester’s cam-
paign because it conflicted with her
efforts to reboot the Pitt Ski and Snow-
board Club. She added that she’s “pretty
familiar” with the allocations process

she said.

Judicial Committee Chairwoman
Aud'rey‘Winn said the Judicial Com-
mittee recommended that the Board
releases the interview questions at least
24 hours before the interviews take
place “to ensure that no interviewee
receives hostile questioning, is given
unfairly difficult questions or, alter-
nately, is given unfairly easy questions
that makes them shine without really
earning it.” A

Elections Committee Chairwoman
Lauren Barney said that b she support-
ed the Judicial Committee’s proposal

“I

understand that it’s not a Iotot

time.”

Mike Nites

from the organizational side. .

To avoid “prewritten answers,” Nites
said he will not publicly release speciﬁc
interview questions, but candidates
can expect the Board to ask general
questions about their knowledge of stu-
dent government. General questions,
according to Nites, would include ap-
plicants’ knowledge of the allocations
process and project ideas for student
government. ‘

“I want honest answers, but in any
interview, you can expect standard
questions,” Nites said.

Nites said he would make a list of
questions for the '/candidates and then
discuss those questions with the rest of
the Board before the public interviews.

Epner also agreed that the Board’s

decision to not release questions before »

interviews will generate more genuine
responses.
“That puts everyone on the spot,”

to put the interview questions online ’

in advance.

“I support Chairwoman Winn’s de- l

cision to make the questions public
because if all the candidates are receiv-
ing the same fundamental questions, it
shouldn’t matter when those questions
come out,” Barney said. I

Nites said after discussing the inter-
view format with the Judicial Commit-

tee on’Thursday night, he has decided
the Board should conduct interviews
with each candidate individually. He
said that he might conduct the inter-
views in a way that would require any
candidate not being interviewed to
leave the room, but also said he is still
working on the “logistics” of the inter-
view process.‘ A . - 7

Nites said he, decided tomake the
Board’s deliberations over the candi-
dates private, after the Judicial Com-
mittee recommendedthat it be done so.

Winn said she» andthe rest of the

- committee were concerned that Board ,

members would not express their hon-

_est opinions in front of a public audi-

ence.‘ ’ .
“We didn’t want the candidates to

have to’ sit there [if] feedback was bru-

tal and turn the interview process into
a ritual of public humiliation,” Winn
said in an email.

Winn also said theJudi_cia1Commit-
tee was concerned about transparency,
but decided that the Board delibera-
tions should be private after a vote

V between committee members.

But Nites said the public nature of
the interviews would not impact the

‘Board’s conduct.

“We’re not going to be hostile to-

I ward any of the candidates, which is .

part of the reason why the interviews.
are public,” Nites said. “But even if the
meetings weren’t public, I think the
Board members’ integrity would keep
the interviews diplomatic anyway.” I

Online Pokemon revival kindles nostalgia, global community

Patrick Mallee
Copy Clzigf

In the past few weeks, an Internet
fad has brought tens of thousands
of people together to accomplish
a single goal: to play “Pokemon.”

More speciﬁcally, these com-
munal gamers -have come to-
gether to try to play the exact

same game of “Pokemon” all at I

the same time —— with some un—.
expectedly hilarious outcomes.
The video-game-streaming
website Twitch.tv has hosted a
channel for more than 17 days
now that constantly streams a
game of “Pokemon” in which any
site member can take part. While
the ﬁrst game in the “Pokemon”
series has already been beaten by
those taking part in the phenom-
enon, the stream moderator has
uploaded the next. game in the
series for players to begin work-
ing through. Members are able
to control the in—game character
by inputting various commands

one could employ on a Nintendo
Game Boy (up, left, A, B, start,
etc.) to control the single un-
named protagonist of the popu-
lar monster-catching video game
ﬁrst. released in the late 1990s.
The catch is that, with about
70,000 peopletrying to conduct
the activities of a single character
at any given point in time, this
isn’t exactly the simplest task.
Thousands of inputs are pro-
cessed by the game every minute,
meaning that many ‘cancel each

. other out or go un—implemented

while others are conducted.
Most of the time, the pro-
tagonist simply walks in circles
and repeats conversations ad
nauseam with other in—game
characters. At the most exciting
points of this endeavor, the mob
of online players has acciden-
tally thrown away useful items
and released the team’s beloved
“Pokemon” from its control. But,
surprisingly, the group has man-
aged to unite strongly enough to

advance the protagonist through
major plot points of the game.

It would seem that the vast
majority of -people who’ve fol-
lowed this proclaimed “social ex-
periment” have shown up initially
because of the immense nostalgic
value that the “Pokemon” series
inspires in the hearts of all us pro-
verbial ’90s kids. Many of us —
myself, included — grew up with
these games, which have evolved
with each new release on the way
to selling more than 200 million
copies around the world.

The vast majority of people
who keep up with the stream’s
progress, however, stay to take
part in the literal society that has
developed at an astoundingly
rapid pace within the conﬁnes
of a single webpage.

After days of players arguing,
a system of governance developed
within the game’s code to aid site
members in achieving progress in
the game. A community formed
on the popular social media site

Reddit to chronicle the progress
of the game’s protagonist. A faux
religion loosely based on Chris-
tianity spawned from frequent
humorous “consultations” of a
rarely usable item — if you’re cu-
rious about the details, quickly
Google “Lord Helix” or “Bird]e-
sus,” you’ll be glad you did.

- The stream even suffered a
number of “terrorist attacks” in
which Twitch site members led
rebellions to intentionally hinder
the progress of the game.

Against all odds, this past
weekend the TwitchPlaysPoke-
mon followers managed to com-
plete the game’s main objective of
defeating the ﬁnal and most chal-
lenging set of “Pokemon” teams
in exactly 16 days, 7 hours, 45
minutes and 30 seconds of con-
tinuous gameplay. The game drew
in more than 1.1 million players
who sent a total of more than 122
million game commands, accord-
ing to the Twitch PR director in
a release posted to the website’s

ofﬁcial blog.

What I found most amazing
about all of this is how games
have an immeasurable power
to bring people together. For
further evidence, look at the re-
cently ended Olympic games in
Sochi, Russia: Despite immense
disparity in political outlooks and
human-rights issues, the coun-
tries of the world are able to come
together every other year to cel-
ebrate the love of competition
that humanity shares.

In the same vein, TwitchPlay-
sPokemon has used the Internet
to create a similar connection of
the world’s varied societies to
share in our common human-
ity. Though it’s merely a bunch
of video-game lovers sitting at
computer screens pushing a
few buttons, this phenomenon
should be renowned for the pro-
found impact it has had on the
social community embodied by
the Internet. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

March 8, 2014 1 The Pitt News l vvvx/\/v.pittnevvs.com

Panthers escape South Bend
with 85-81 overtime victory

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Lamar Patterson caught the ball on the
wing with seconds to play in a tie game
against Notre Dame and had an open
lane to the basket for what would have
been a game-winning layup. Instead, he
was halted by a time out.

Head coach Jamie Dixon called time-
out with 2.8 seconds remaining to set
up a new play.

Out of the timeout, James Robinson
missed a fadeaway mid—range jumper,
and the Panthers and Irish went to over-
time. Dixon’s decision elicited memories
of Pitt’s loss to Syracuse Feb. 12 when Ty-
ler Ennis made his 35-foot buzzer beater
after a late Pitt timeout.

But in the overtime period, Pitt (22-
7, 10-6 ACC) made its free throws and
avoided another late loss with a 85-81
win in South Bend, Ind. — the ﬁrst win
for the Panthers at Purcell Pavilion in
nearly nine years. But while the Panthers
won the game, Dixon said the team will
still be questioned. ‘

“I thought it was the right play, and
it turned out that it wasn’t,” Dixon said.
“We got a good look right after that.”

The Panthers were led by Patterson’s
game-high 20 points, to which he added
an additional seven rebounds and seven
assists. Talib Zanna posted a double-
double with 17 points and 14 rebounds
while Cameron Wright scored 15 points,
and Michael Young added 13.

Notre Dame (15-15, 6-11 ACC) shot
7-of-9 from 3-point range in the ﬁrst half
and led by as much as 12 points early.
But with strong offensive rebounding,
the Panthers closed their deﬁcit to just
four points at the half, 39-35.

Head coach Mike Brey said “second
shots and turnovers” were the reason
Notre Dame couldn’t pull away from the
Panthers, which ultimately cost the Irish

the game.

Pat Connaughton led the Fighting
Irish with 19 points and started his day
7—of-8 from the ﬁeld. But an injury to
his ankle in the second half, which his
head coach ﬁgured would sideline him,
limited him for the rest of the game.

“He’s got to be pretty sore with a
twisted ankle,” Brey said. ,

Eric Atkins scored 17 points and
handed out a game-high nine assists
while freshman Steve Vasturia chipped

in 15 points and made three 3—pointers.

The Irish cooled off from their 70 —per—
cent shooting that began the game, but
still ﬁnished with a 54.8 percent clip.
Patterson said that he knew entering
the game that a win against Notre Dame
would require ﬁnding a way to counter
the Irish shooters.

“They shoot the heck out of the ball,”
Patterson said. “But we overcame that
and did what we do and rode them out.”

Pitt shot 43.1 percent from the ﬁeld
after a cold start, which kept the Pan-
thers’ shooting percentage in the 20-per-
cent range for most of the ﬁrst half.

The Panthers mitigated Notre Dame’s
hot shooting, not with scoring of their
own, but by dominating the offensive
glass. Pitt finished with 38 total re-
bounds that included 21 offensive re-
bounds, and the Fighting Irish recorded
22 total rebounds.

Young said that controlling the re-
bounding margin and making free
throws kept the Panthers close and was
“what ultimately got [them] the win”
after falling behind early.

At the free—throw line, the Panthers
shot 85.7 percent on 24-of-28 shooting,
which Dixon credited as helping his team
close out the game.

“They were going a great job of foul-
ing immediately,” Dixon said. “We had
different guys in there that could hit the
free throws.”
