A number of Pitt graduate stu-
dents, along with the Latin American
Culture Union, have organized activi-
ties to raise money for Hurricane
Mitch victims in Honduras and
Nicaragua.

As one way to raise money, LACU

a

has decided to organize a benefit_

party. Another idea is to hold a cultur-
al event involving all the Latin
American groups on campus. The
event would include singers, dancers,
poetry readings and Latin American
bands.

Brent Rondon, chairman of
LACU, along with two other graduate
students, Sylvia Torres and
Clementina Salloum, met with repre-
sentatives from the Red Cross last
week to discuss relief strategies.

“The focus of the group is to gath-
er money for the victims,” said

 
    

 

COURTESY OF NSA
Hurricane Mitch has devastated large parts of Honduras and Nicaragua.
Pitt students are helping to raise money for relief efforts.

Rondon. “The cost of sending medi-
cine and supplies to them is so expen-
sive.”

The group keeps in touch with its
contacts in Central America through e-
mail. Because this method of commu-

rricane victims

nication is almost instantaneous,
LACU receives updated information
about troubled areas from its contacts
and can quickly respond to those
areas’ needs.

According to Torres, Honduras
and Nicaragua are the two countries
most affected by Hurricane Mitch.

Torres said the death toll between
the two countries has reached 11,000,
and 13,000 more are missing.

“Each day, by the hour, the death
toll is raising,” Torres said. “It will
take almost 30 years to rebuild the
area’s life structure.”

Torres also said that nearly 1 mil-
lion of Nicaragua’s 5.5 million inhabi-
tants have been evacuated from the
area.
Through e-mail, Torres has
learned that inhabitants of Central
America have accessto the supplies

P Our newspaper has redesigned its flag,
and we want feedback from the Pitt community.

The Pitt News has a new look:
Let us know what you think

Hal Turner C
Edltor In chlef

You may notice today’s Pitt
News looks slightly different.

Well, we kept the‘ old design, or
variations of it, for about the last
year and a half, and then decided it
was time to start looking a little
more contemporary.

The old font was outdated, and
there wasn’t enough information on
the front page. You’ll notice the
flag now contains the weather and a

preview of the staff editorial. It,

looked to us like some folks could-
n’t even find the weather on page
two.

Also, the title is now solid
black. We liked the old one’s
blue/yellow transition, but it soon
grew too gimmicky and looked a
little unprofessional.

So here we stand. We want to
know what our audience thinks, and
we welcome suggestions and criti-
cism. Postal mail is always nice, so
send letters to 434 WPU. But it‘
really will be easiest for everyone
to write e-mail to:
pittnews+@pitt.edu.

While you’re at it, we’d love to
hear what you all have to say about
the rest of the paper, good and bad.
Visit our Web page at www.pit-
tnews.com, and tell us how easy or
difficult it is to navigate. How’s our
news and_ sports coverage? Do you
particularly hate any opinions
columnists or feel that any subjects
are overworked?

Honestly, all constructive criti-
cism is welcome. After all, the
paper is published every day for
you, the Pitt community, and we do
aim to please.

fastest grad school investment return

Megan McDonald
For The Pitt News

If your business administration
graduate-school program ' allows
you to invest less of your life going
to class, miss less work and pay off
the cost of your degree faster than
any other program in the country,
you must be going to Pitt.

According to a recent issue of
Business Week magazine, Pitt’s
Katz Graduate School of Business
offers the fastest return on a stu-
dent’s investment. .

Every full-time student in the
Masters of Business Administration
program at Katz earns a degree in
11 months.

“We are very heartened by the
return on investment, which results
from a sensible tuition as well as
the 11-month program,” Katz Dean
Rick~Winter said.

Business Week published the
largest-ever survey of business
administration graduate-school pro-
grams last month, sending question-
naires to 9,568 students graduating

  

with MBAs from 61 schools.
Graduates rated their schools on
issues such as career placement,
teaching quality and program con-
tent. , -
A typical Katz student will

need 3.7 years to recover his or her

graduate school investment, accord-

ing to the survey. The magazine

arrived at that conclusion by com-

bining a student’s tuition with the

wages the student lost by going to

graduate school for two years. That

amount was weighed against the

salary gains after students went

back to work.

g “I made up the cost of my pro-

gram the first year in business for

myself,”said graduate Kris Arnold,

president of Arnold Forms &

Supply. “The 11-month program

was crucial to me, it was the whole

reason I went to the school.”

Not everyone is fortunate
enough to start their own business,
but that doesn’t seem to hinder the
statistics.

Researchers say nicotine could
help Alzheimer's potients I

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

LOS ANGELES —
Alzheimer_’s patients could one day
look to nicotine-like compounds to
boost their memory.

V Scientists at the. annual meeting

 the society for neuroscie_nce.inV
L_2os Angeles are confident they can...

design medications to capitalize on

the benefit‘ of nicotine  without
cardiovascular and other side
effects.

Research on lab rats, co.rjduct’ed

by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco,” shows

‘nicotine-like compounds increifse

.y—_.}.___.._~._.._.___ _

both short— and long—term memory
and show persistent benefits without
toxic side effects.

’ Researchers are looking at nico-
tine because it’s knownto stimulate
receptors for a nerve cell-signaling
chemical that’s important in learn-
ing and memory. When Alzheimer's
patients are given a nicotine patch,
those receptors are stimulated, and
their attention improves.

Scientists say further studies are
needed to substantiate early find-
ings.

NEW YORK — A judge has
approved the largest settlement of
its kind in a case against some of the
biggest names on Wall Street.

Thirty—seven brokerages will
pay more than 1 billion dollars to
investors who claim they were
cheated in a price-fixing conspiracy
involving stocks on the NASDAQ
stock" market.

The securities firms include
Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and
Salomon Smith Barney. They have
denied any wrongdoing.

The settlement follows govern-
ment action to discipline the big
brokerage houses for keeping stock
prices ‘ artificially high.
Investigators said the firms were
fattening their own profits while
raising the costs for investors. '

WASHINGTON —~ Bill Gates
denied that Microsoft ever tried to
discourage i.ts partner, Intel, from
designing software.

In videotaped testimony shown
at the Washington anti—trust trial,
Gates said Intel was wasting its

5money on low-quality software that

didn’t even work with the Windows
95 operating system.

When a Justice Department
lawyer asked Gates if he or anyone
else had tried to persuade Intel not
to make software, he waited about
15 seconds before answering,“no.”

The Justice Department con-

tends that.Microsoft tried to intimi-
date Intel and other high-tech com-
petitors, using its inﬂuence in- the
computer industry.

Intel is best known for making
computer chips.

NORFOLK, Va., — One Navy

' WASHINGTON +“’W~hat ,.d__oes
Monica Lewinsky really sound like?
That burning question’ will be
answered this week when the House
Judiciary Committee releases
secretly recorded tapes of
Lewinsky’s telephone conversations
with Linda _Tripp.

The story of Lewinsky’s affair
with President Clinton has been told
by others and set down on stacks of
documents collected by Independent
Council Kenneth Starr, but
Lewinsky has yet to publicly speak
about it or anything else.

The 25-year-old has moved
through a sea of cameras and
reporters without uttering a word —
letting her parents, lawyers or a
spokesperson do the talking for her.

In edited transcripts of the Tripp
tapes released last month, Lewinsky
whines,‘ worries, plots, complains
and cries over her now very public
relationship with President Clinton.

PHILADELPHIA: — Some
people find things they need on the
the Internet. Others find love.

Theresa Fleming found both.

The York, Pa., woman met a
man from England while online.
After a whirlwind courtship, they
were married in September.

Wednesday, her new husband
will give her the most precious gift
imaginable — the gift of life.

Ian Fleming will give one of his
kidneys to his 36-year-old bride,

,who has been plagued by health

problems, including kidney failure,
for over a decade.

Theresa Fleming said some of
her friends and family doubted Ian’s
sincerity when they got married so
fast. She never had any doubts and
is convinced his willingness to give
her a transplant will quiet the
naysayers.

ate Jim Leher. “In my two and a
half years since I’ve been out, I’ve
definitely paid those lost wages off,
because I’m making at least twice
as much.” _ '

Leher said that Katz compares
well to other business schools.

, “I looked at a lot of schools. Pitt

because it’s inexpensive, faster and
you don’t sacrifice the quality of

award

Whenever good or bad news breaks
at Pitt, University Spokesman Kenneth
Service is the man who stands in front of
the television cameras
reporters’ questions.

In recognition of his representation of
the University and his record of charitable
activity, Service won an election to the
Public Relations Society of America

the profession and to the community.

Service, director of Pitt’s oﬁce of
news and information, was one of only 22
people across the nation inducted this
year. Total membership in the College of
Fellows is only 31, which is less than 2
percent of the PRSA’s more than 19,000
members.

As an accredited member of the
PRSA, Service is a member of the group’s
executive committee of Counselors to
Higher Education. He is past chairman of
the PRSA’s Energy and Natural

All water sources in the region are
contaminated, and Central Americans
are in need of chlorine to purify it.
Thick, black plastic is also needed to
build shelters for residents. .

Numerous disasters, including
Hurricane Mitch, have affected these
countries ‘within the past several
weeks. ‘ ’

During the hurricane, the crater of
Casitais, a volcano in Nicaragua, filled.
with water that spilled over the sides
and caused a tremendous mudslide,
burying 17 communities and killing
nearly 2,000 people.

Other mudslides and the ﬂooding
of the river bordering Honduras and
Nicaragua caused the destruction’ of
the Raiti, an ethnic tribe. Helicopters
ﬂying over the area could not see the
tribal grounds and other area commu-
nities.

Rain will continue, due to the fact
that it is winter in Central America, the
area’s rainy season.

Four days before Hurricane Mitch

arrived in Central America, Nicaragua

had a series of 317 small earthquakes.
“The people were already in a
state of panic,” Torres said. '

ing it dangerous for people to walk in

The economy of these countries is
based on their harvests, and nearly 80
percent of the total ‘crops have already
been lost.

“They really are in need of help,”
said Rondon. V

Torres said that the presidents of
Nicaragua and Honduras are thinking
of declaring the devastated areas
national cemeteriesibecause so many
dead bodies litter the ground.

A former Pitt student, Brig. Gen.
Paul M. Lee, Jr., has also attempted to
raise money for victims of a hurricane.

Lee, along with 50 other Marines,
arrived in Puerto Rico to aid victims

of Hurricane George.
The Marines brought equipment to
build bridges that had been washed
away. They also brought 171 vehicles,
"including six bulldozers, 50 diesel-
powered electric generators and eight
reverse osmosis water purification
units capable of producing nearly
100,000 gallons of purified water a
day. -
The Marines assisted residents in

placing large protective tarpaulins

over badly damaged roofs. Many resi-
dents had their entire roofs ripped
from their homes as a result of
Hurricane George.

Lee could not be reached for com-
ment concerning the relief efforts.

LACU will hold a meeting today
at 7:30 p.m. in Bellefield Hall. Anyone

interested in helping raise funds for
the victims is encouraged to attend.

“The more people attend, the more
we can distribute tasks to_ everyone
and accomplish these activities,” said
Torres.

The group hopes to continue the
Tuesday meetings to discuss how
relief efforts are continuing and to
decide what needs to be completed
next.

A list of how the financial aid is
being used in Central America will be
published on LACU’s Web page.

Can cigarette company
research betrustecl?  

Put this in your pipe and smoke

-it.
A study released by _tl1e R. J. I

Reynolds Tobacco - company has
shown that nicotine-like compounds
can boost Alzheimer’s patients’
memory. Nicotine, according to the
unbiased, impartial researchers at R.
J. Reynolds, stimulates receptors for
a nerve cell—signalling chemical

that’s important in learning and

memory.

Regardless of whether the
research is correct or not, (and studies
carried out by independent
researchers have drawn similar con-
clusions), R. J. Reynolds, Philip
Morris and other tobacco giants have
been insisting that nicotine is not
addictive and is not detrimental to a
person’s health for quite some time;
now, R J. Reynolds claims that nico-
tine is good for people. Its latest
“ﬁndings” are to be taken not so
much with a grain of salt but with a
big rock of it.

VV1th companies such as R. J.
Reynolds looking out for the interest
of the public (albeit, the cigarette-
buying public), who needs indepen-
dent research carried out by medical
schools .-and research institutions? In
the same vein, why not have Shell
researchers proctor a survey on the
socioeconomic effects of exploitative

oil corporations in Nigeria? Their

ﬁndings will be impartial too, right?
Maybe with nicotine included in

their prescriptions, some old cancer

patients will remember to keep their — I

chemotherapy appointments. Quite a
honid ﬁnding, actually: Smokers
remember that they’re destroying
their lungs and other vital organs, yet
will still be addicted H '

The next obvious step for R. J.
Reynolds would be to install ciga-
rette vending machines in schools,
with, signs saying “Cigarettes give
you good grades.” The company is
already notorious for targeting kids,

, so why not push them further? Since

it’s found that nicotine is good for
memory retention, there can’t possi-
bly be any reason why it shouldn’t
push for vending cigarettes in
schools. VV1th a Republican
Congress again, this could well be a
reality. R J. Reynolds’ lining of con-
gressional pockets could ﬁnally reap
dividends.

So, when Old Uncle Jeb lights
up an after-dinner stogie, curse him
not for ruining his health, but for
smokin’ out the house. Even though
he’l1 recall war stories ﬂrat the rest of
the family would rather he’d forget,
R J . Reynolds has his best interests
at heart. That is, as long as heremem-
bers to keep smokin’

  Finally, an election about something

s<:§1'IharIl< goodness it’s over. VV1th Election ‘98
come and gone, the two major parties are now
scrambling over one another to spin the results of
the election in their favor. In contrast to the bru-
 dull, entirely unsurprising 1996 election,
this one turned in a number of surprises, not the
least of which was Jesse “The Body” Ventnra’s
election to ﬂre govemorship of Minnesota. Here
are a few things I found interesting:

, - The resurrection of the “Solid South.’_’ For
more than one hundred years, from after the
Civil War to the 1980s, the South was considered
a Democratic stronghold. When Lyndon
Johnson "signed the 1964 Civil Rights bill, he
remarked to an aide: “I think we just delivered
the South to the Republican Party for a long time
to come.” After the 1994 elections, ﬂrere was
much talk about the solidly Democratic South
becoming an impregnable
Republican fortress, a refuge from
which the Republicans could go
forth and attack Democratic strong-
holds in the North. ' V

In fact, theSoutli turned out to
be solidly Democratic territory on Nov. 3.
Democrats won the Georgia, Alabama and
South Carolina gubernatorial races. In South
Carolina, Senator Ernest Hollings, a gerIﬂeman-
ly old-school Democrat, won a sixth term
against a young, very conservative
Congressman In North Carolina, attorney John
Edwards upset conservative Senator Lauch
Faircloth. In. Congressional races across the

south, Democrats fared well, even picking up a.
9 seat in Mississippi. Republicans presented them-

selves as true-blue conservatives, while the

Democrats presented themselves to the elec-‘

torate as pragmatists who care deeply about
issues such as education;

0 The Lewinsky scandal hurt the
Republicans. Polls say that the scandal was
mostly a non-starter for the voters, but it did have
an effect nevertheless. In Washington state, a
close congressional race between an incumbent
Republican and his Democratic challenger was
decided when the Republican National
Committee ran a series of ads attacking President

cidence is it that Aﬁican—American tumout was
dramatically up in states like Alabama, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia? In the
case of South Carolina, African-Americans
made up one quarter of the electorate and voted
91 percent for Senator Hollings. »

0 The conservative agenda just isn’t what it
used to be. Republicans have attempted to spin
1998 as a Seiry‘eld election — that is, an election
about nothing; Actually it was about something.
It was a rejection of the conservative agenda of
the last four years. While the Republicans in
Congress have pledged to wage an ideological
war, and eliminate the Department of Education,
tear down those pesky environmental regula-
tions that protect the public health and pursue an
impeachment strategy against the public’s wish-
es, Republican Governors have ruled pragmati-
cally. The “compassionate conser-
vatism” of governors such as Texas’
George W. Bush and» WIsconsin’s
Tommy Thompson in is a big reason
why Republican governors did well
on Election Day. Idcologues, by and
large, went down in defeat alter defeat. In the
California governor’s race, Republican Dan
Lungren consistently trumpeted his adherence to
the Reaganite agenda only to become the ﬁrst
Republican in sixteen years to lose the
Governor’s oﬁice. ' '

- A Democrat has held the Georgia gover-
nor’s mansion for the last 126 years. Think about
that. The Republicans haven’t won a governor’s
race in Georgia since Reconstruction ended.

party nominates centrist candidates who can

Philadelphia, who ' decide elections in
Pennsylvania, the Republicans will have a lock
on the state-wide oﬂices like governor and sena-.
tor. Nominating candidates who sound like they
are refugees from the 1930s just won’t cut it.

THE Prrr Nsws: QPINIONS

Killing in Hue name of venison

James Maude
Oplnlons Edltor

I feel their evil gaze as I walk ﬁorn my
front door to my car every morning. Their

_ eyes frxon me, wishing to savagely attack

me with their antlers and disembowel me so
they can feed my intestines to their children.
Yes, the vicious, pillaging, brutal, merciless,
savage deer of Upper St. Clair have driven
suburban Pittsburghers too far. But no more
shall we live infear—theUpper St. Clair
Ad Hoc Deer Committee is going to bring
the dark “Age of the Deer” to an end in one
of Pittsburgh’s most aﬂluent neighbor-
hoods.

Apparenﬂy, there are just too many

I damn deer in Upper St. Clair. Therefore, the

brave men of the USC Ad Hoc Deer
Committee (I love the way suburbanites
tack “ad hoc” onto any committee they form
to deal with any issue, as if anyone would
think that a deer committee would deal with
other issues such as sanitation or garbage
removal), in the interests of USC residents,
took it upon themselves to hire archers to sit
in elevated tree stands and cull some deer.
Hyperbole aside, suburban politics has

. never been more ridiculous. Upper St. Clair

is faced with two opposing yet equally stu-
pid factions: those who believe that Upper
St. Clair needs to exterminate a big chunk of
the deer population and those who believe
that the archers in the trees may accidental-
ly kill people (par1icularly children, though

' Sure, not as

it speaks poorly of some USC residents that
they think their children look like deer).
People choose to live in Upper St. Clair
because it’s one of the more aﬂluent neigh-
borhoods of Allegheny County. Its land-
scape, setting and position make it one of
the more desirable areas to live. Why, then,
do some residents complain about the over-
abundance of nature when it’s exactly the
type of setting
they wanted in
the ﬁrst place?
If ’ deer are
bringing some
residents to ﬂre
point of despair, .
why don’t they
move to the
Hill District or
Wilkinsburg?

desirable an
area code, but
hey, those psy- _
chotic deer ‘K
have at least
three highways to cross to get to you.

Mark F. Marks (not to be confused with
Marky Mark aka. Mark Wahlberg), a
member of the USC Ad Hoc Deer
Committee, said in the Nov. 4 issue of The
Almanac, a newspaper based in the South
Hills, that archers in the woods of Upper St.
Clair “are not simply shooting everything
that moves as some misinformed people

   

have come to believe.” But judging by the
nrnrrber of deer killed in Upper St. Clair in
October, the archers aren’t doing a great job
shooting moving deer. Thirty-one deer have
been killed by archers, compared to 28
killed by vehicles. Archers appear to have
the upper hand but clearly are proving to be
marginally effective at best. Of the time and
effort spent by these archers, and judging by

the ﬁnal tally, I’d
‘ say leave the
slaughter to the
cars. It may be
31-28 in favor of
. S the archers this
, month, but with
' ice setting in on
the roads and
poorer visibility
due to snow and
scarce food, the
tide could turn
back in favor of
the automobiles.

vehicular comeback

Lois Fussell, an Upper St. Clair resi-
dent, stated in the Nov. 4 issue of The
Almanac, “Families who need chernical-
free meat have beneﬁtted from the hunt and
have received over 200 pounds of venison‘,
and food banks are receiving venison.” An
obvious beneﬁt, I’m sure, though I’m not
sure that families in need are families who

for A

need chernical-free meat. In a perfect soci-
ety, in Utopia, every family would have a
chemical-free pot roast on the table. I just
can’t see how the attempt to redistribute
deer meat in suburban Pittsburgh can be of
any advantage to anyone other than the
hunters themselves (primary recipients of
the deer meat). Any meat left over and
donated to food banks after the hunters and
their families have ﬁnished the ﬁrst servings
can’t be that much.

On the other side of the coin (or the ﬂip
side of the deer droppings), some parents of
children are concerned that it is no longer
safe to main the woods of Upper St. Clair.
Fearing a scenario similar to that in
“Deliverance” or “Breakdown,” some par-
ents are circulating ﬂiers at Baker
Elementary School advising children to
keep out of the woods, as archers are using
the nearby area to hunt deer. As Marks him-
self stated, only two people have been killed
in archery hunting accidents in
Pennsylvania since 1990. Rest assured, nei-
ther was in a suburban setting.

. The arguments will, however, continue
to dominate the pages of The Almanac
(along with the pointless rantings of Jim

‘ O’Brien, who I- shouldn’t really insult see-

ing as he’s a former Pitt News writer) and
endless town hall meetings. Isn’t suburban,
yuppie politics just so inane?

. James Maude thinks that all deer in Upper

St. Clair should have tongue rings.

G.S. Broz and

Marc Wisnosky

We write this, anticipating the forth-
coming Student Government Board elec-
tion, in the hopes that we can provide both
the candidates and the voting populace
with an otherwise unseen aspect of the
true nature of the intricacies involved in
running a highly successful campaign.

It was a cold, surmy day in early
October 1997. We realized our platfonn
was unparalleled in its greatness. No other
candidates could boast they possessed
even half of the exceptional brain trust that
God had graced us with. For every one
student who was wise enough to heed our
prophetic orations, there were 10 others
behind them ready to board the
Broz/Wisnosky train. We earnestly debat-
ed the possibility of any other candidate
receiving even a single vote.

Our landslide victory, unprecedented
in the history of the University of
Pittsburgh, boded ill tidings for all others
who dared to contend with us. We ques-
tioned whether the student body, not to
mention the administration, could with-
stand such a radical shift in student gov-
ernment policy. This quandary perplexed

us to no end. We felt compelled to bring
the situation to our understanding carn-
paign manager, Mr. J ohrmy Walker.

‘ VV1th the sun rising from its Oriental
depths, emerging from the prison of night,
so too did the inevitable conclusion to our
dilemma emerge from the confused
depths of our innermost selves. Yet, it took
until well past the sun’s descent into its
westernmost sanctuary until we had for-
mulated the answer into a tangible reality.
In lay1nan’s terms: It was about 1 a.m.

We sat at the coffee table with Mr.
Walker once again. We expressed our fear
that our domination of the year’s elections
would result in an extreme upheaval of the
normative policies of the University. We
felt it might be unwise to subject the
University to such an abrupt transforma-
tion. Mr. Walker suggested: “Perhaps, a

puppet regime.” To us, the idea was crazy.‘

But then «again, it might just be crazy
enough to work. The execution of such a
coup d’etat proved to be our next obstacle.
We decided to sleep on it (in fact, Mr.
Walker coerced us- into our individual
reposes; too much of any whiskey, even
the ﬁnest, will do that).

The next day, the three of us met
again. We noted that Mr. Walker was
somewhat drained from the night before

1997 SGB elections

and could only offer minimal assistance.
Once we had ﬁnally extracted all we could
from him, we knew we would have to
push ahead only half-lit. Our plan: to whet
the appetites of the_ student body by
promising them a relatively successful
Student Government Board (in compari-
son to the impotent regimes of the school’s
past).

We had it! It was only a matter of pre-
cise implementation. This proved to be

easier than any other aspect of the election _
_ process thus far. First of all, we sought

only those who would rather hit a bong
than aid in the ﬁuition of our ingenious
plot. Secondly, we held palaver with the

Interfratemity Council, thus convincing,

them that only Greeks and their slates
were worthy of their members’ votes.
While one might logically infer that
Greeks would vote in such a manner, i.e.
for other Greeks, the fact was, we had
already convinced them by means of our
exceptional charisma and platform that we
were the ideal candidates. Convincing
them to ignore their better judgement and
adopt our new plan came only with stri-
dent assurances of future moneys set aside
from plarmed SGB misuse.

Finally, we. hand-picked more than
500 CAS students to elect the independent

candidates of our choosing. Any other stu-
dents who actually voted did so unaware
of our plot.

Our last problem, one soon to be rec- .

tiﬁed: Joe Gielata or Damon Hudac? It
seemed a hard call. We left the decision up
to those voters who exercised their right,
independent of our grand design. The ver-
itable end having been reached, we were
left to wait until the election reached our
favorable conclusion. Meanwhile, we
assumedthe guise of pompous victors.

Covertly, however, we strategically
scattered slate agents campus-wide in
order to deter informed students ﬁom vot-
ing for our seemingly destined slate.
_ In the end, all worked out in accor-
dance with our plans. We pierced through
the fog of the elections, in control of
everything yet responsible for nothing.

Wisely, we heeded Mr. Walker’s
advice, and indeed, by proxy, we now hold
control of the Student Government Board.
Admittedly, we forfeited individual glo-
ries for the sake of a smooth—n1nning,
hard-working leadership unit, in return for
the luxury of the effortless execution of
our benign will.

G.S Broz and Marc Wsnosky say “F—k
the tagline!”

Hey Chris
Simms, give us
a chance

I spent the weekend shaking my
head and squinting my eyes, trying
to picture exactly what has hap-
pened to the Pitt Panther football
team. One month ago, it was fresh
off of a 35-0 blowout of Akron, a
team that beat Temple.

Saturday, these same Panthers
lost to Temple. Even worse, theloss
was at home, the second time a
team Pitt should have crushed left
town with a victory. Yet something
is telling me Pitt shouldn’t have
won either game. Sometimes it is
hard to admit a rebuilding process
is occurring when it is your own
school. Hey, I’m only here four
years (five or six, more realistical-
ly). How long do we have to wait?

Well, this die—hard football fan
cursed the radio as he listened to
Bill Hillgrove barely coming
through the waves at work Saturday
and needed a little pick-me—up.
Hillgrove, as he was going off the
air for a commercial break, said,
“What will happen the rest of the
season?” Good question.

I did what every knowledgeable
Panther fan can do after a disheart-
ening loss to Temple. Wait a
minute; Temple? No, please, stop
the bleeding. Anyway, I wrote a let-
ter to New Jersey high—school quar-
terback Chris Simms, son of former
New York Giant Phil Simms. He is
considered the top prospect at his

position and has Pitton hisfinal .

list of schools.

Dear Chris or Mr. Simms (whichev-
er you prefer),

I would like to congratulate you
on your success throughout your
high—school career and would like
to cordially invite you to join me in
attending the University of
Pittsburgh next year. We in
Oakland have not seen the likes of
a quarterback like T you since Dan
Marino. [Plug No. 1] Yes, Dan
Marino graced us with his presence
.15 years ago, and we have not been
the same since. Sure, John
Congemi, Sal Genilla and Darnell

ed, but compared to you, they are
all lifetime bench riders.

On Friday, the . Panthers visited

Walt Harris is not as dumb-
founded as the rest of us.

He is not dumbfounded that
Pitt’s 17th-ranked defense could
give up 412 yards to the Temple
Owls in its 34-33 loss on Saturday.

Not dumbfounded that the
Panthers were outscored, 20-7, in
the fourth quarter in the process of
losing a lead for the second consec-
utive game.

“I have a higher respect, I think,
than a lot of people do for Bobby
Wallace and Temple,” Harris said at
hiss-apress conference yesterday. “To
their ‘credit, they held us to field
goals [in the second half], and field
goals don’t beat you.”

To say Harris wasn’t extremely
disappointed to give up another
comeback defeat would not be
accurate, though.

“If we played a little better, the
game might have been over in the
first half,” he said. ,

Pitt’s defensive effort exempli-
fies Harris’ disappointment.

The Panthers stopped most of
the short yardage plays but col-
lapsed on several long throws.

“If you have to drive the ball
against our defense, it’s tough,”
Harris said. “If you say one thing
has kept our defense from continu-
ally playing at a high level, it’s the
fact that we’ve given up the long

pass, and I know it’s frustrating for ’

[the defensive players].”

There were some positives in
the game, including running back
Brandon Williams’ first 100—yard
performance.

“What I liked about Brandon, I
thought he ran hard and he protect-
ed the football,” Harris said. “Those
are two ingredients of the four or
five ingredients you have to have in
order to be a dominant back.”

“I thought offensively, though,
we had a horrible practice on
Wednesday, and it cost us,” Harris
said. “We got our eye off the bulls-
eye, so to speak.”

With the realization that the- I

possibility of going to a bowl game
vanished with the loss on Saturday
and that the Panthers are now limit-
ed to three more games, Harris gave
a premature analysis of the season
and the football program.

“I think as we look back on this
season in future years, I know that
there’s a lot we can learn from it
and take away from it,” he said.

“We’re probably in better shape
than we were a year ago, physically.
We just have a lot fewer players
who are playing who have been
here, who have paid their dues,”
Harris said.

Harris again referred to the
youth of the team, explaining that
people’s expectations are too high
when they “think that you’ve got a
great chance when you have 34
guys making their first road trip.”

“The good teams that are win-
ning now, just look at their depth
and their classes,” he said. '

Harris is proud of his teams’
efforts this season, regardless of
wins and losses, which, he said “is
sometimes out of our control.”

“We’ve been close to a touch-
down or so behind in every game in
the fourth quarter, and as a coach,
that’s our job.” .

“Our job to put our players in a
position to win, and that’s what I’m
evaluating myself on,” Harris said.

“I can look at‘myself and feel
like I’m doing the job.”

Just before leaving the micro-
phone, Harris quoted former Pi
Panther head coach Johnny Majors,
who had some difficult seasons at
Pitt.

“‘Tough times don’t last; tough
people do.’ ”

Walt Harris did a lot of yelling Saturday in Pitt’s loss to the Temple Owls.

Panther men’s and women's swimming and diving prepare lornew season

Jay Yander
Staff Writer

Even after several key losses to
graduation, both the men’s and the
women’s swimming and diving teams
are poised for a run at the Big East
title. " '

Men’s head coach Chuck Knoles
recruited ll freshmen in the off-sea-
son to fill the void left by departing
co-captains Eric Stefanski and Jon
Haggerty of the two—time defending
Big East champions.

With so many newcomers to the
men’s squad, Knoles believes experi-

ence is the key to the Panthers’ suc-
cess as a team.

“We lack experienced competi-
tors on our team,” Knoles said. “It’ll
be difficult to win early in the season
without experience.”

In addition to having a young
team, the Panthers also have one of
the toughest schedules on the East
Coast. Early opponents include Big
Ten Conference champion Minnesota,
Southeastern Conference champion
South‘ Carolina, Atlantic Coast
Conference champion North Carolina
and Big East Conference runner-up
Syracuse.

Knoles said that this year’s sched-
ule is by far the toughest Pitt has ever
had.

“Sure, it’s tough, but we’re not
going to get better unless we swim
and swim against tough competitors,”
Knoles said.

. Knoles described this year i as a
transition year, although the Big East
title is not too tall an order for the
team. Many of the top Big East teams
had as many key losses as the
Panthers, leaving Pitt in prime posi-
tion to make a legitimate run at the
conference crown.

The main goal of this year’s team

is to ready itself for the Big East
championship, according to Knoles.
The goal seems more reachable than
in past years since this squad is deep-
er than any other team Knoles can
remember coaching.

“We have a very positive team
this year,” Knoles said. “I hope we
can keep ourselves together through-
out the season and keep our spirits

up.”

the conference title.

The Lady Panthers lost nine
members of last year’s squad but
added only eight freshmen with
hopes that the upperclassmen could
carry this season’s team.

“We obviously have to replace
the graduates the best we can,” Keen
said. “We’ll mature as the year goes
on, and things will fall into place.”

Even though maturity is impor-
tant, Keen feels this year’s squad is a
well—rounded group that only needs
competitive experience to take things
to the next level.

A well-rounded group will allow
Keen to put as little pressure as pos-
sible on the incoming freshmen.
Keen’s philosophy is to let the new-
comers progress naturally in a major
college swimming and diving pro-
gram.

“The points will take care of
themselves this year,” Keen said. “I
just hope we can put more of the girls
into the NCAA championships at the
end of the year. That would be great.”

this column alone will bring him to
this campus next year. .

Unless, of course, Chris found
out about the debacle that happened
this weekend against Temple. Wait
—~ Temple? We lost to Temple?
Why is it I can’t read that? I hope
you have an easier time than I do.

I certainly am not giving up
hope. Hell, I was going to write a
column about how Pitt had this plan
to lose five of its first seven games
and then miraculously win four in a
row to get a bid to a bowl game. But
since that won’t be happening,
you’re reading my backup column.

The Panthers still have three big
games against Boston College,
Miami and West Virginia. All three
teams are beatable. The only thing
left for the Panthers to do now is to
show the pride that has been
instilled in ‘them by a wonderful
coaching? staff.

Let us now play the spoilers.
The Boston College game would
not be a spoiler, but a convincing
victory might show that this team
was just one game too late. We beat
Miami last year, and funnier things
have happened.

Nothing would be sweeter,
though, than to have the Panthers
hosting ' the West Virginia’
Mountaineers, who need a win for
first or second place in the confer-
encei

The sweet part would be for Pitt
to run all over WVU and send them
back home wondering just what I
was left pondering after Saturday’s
game.

Pitt does not need to be as des-
perate as I sound. Ijust want to see
Pitt win. Is that so wrong?

Brad Cuprik is a columnist for The
Pitt News. He really wants nothing
to do with the recruiting efforts,
considering he'd have to mention
the fact we lost to Temple Saturday.

Senior Tara Haefner has led the volleyball team with her hustie and

determination this year.

before squeaking past BC in the ﬁnale, 16-
14.

FROM PAGE 8

Sophomore Marcia Thiesen and
junior Paula Zemrowski each had 13 kills
to lead the Panthers. Melissa Alpers added
10 kills and led the team with 14 digs. Lisa
Riggle, a sophomore setter, continued her
stellar defensive play with 13 digs while
adding 41 assists and one of the Panthers’
six service aces in the match. With the
loss, Boston College dropped to 11-16
overall and 0-8 in the Big East
Conference. The Eagles were led by Julia
El-Hag, who had 11 kills and 15 digs.
The women tried to continue their hot

streak by sweeping the weekend’s con-

tests when they visited Providence on
Sunday. But the Friars of Providence were
able to defeat the Panthers handily in three
straight games, 15-10, 15-13, 15-7.

Sarah Katinger had 20 kills and 20
digs to pace Providence. Pitt got strong
performances from Alpers, who had 9
kills, 18 digs, and boﬂi of the team’s ser-
vice aces. Zernrowski added 13 kills and
13 digs, while Riggle had 40 assists.

The Panthers’ record now stands at
14-12 overall and 4-5 in the Big East
Conference. Their ﬁnal two games will be
at home against Notre Dame Saturday and
Syracuse Sunday. Pitt will try to strength-
en its position in the postseason tourna-
ment, to be played Nov. 21-28 at the Civic
Arena

and recording the loss, Pitt goal-
keeper Nicole Bashor, made 11
saves in the entire 90 minutes of
play.

Syracuse goalkeeper Jeanie
King only had to make two saves
while collecting the shutout victory.

The weekend didn’t bring all
bad news for Pitt.

Midfielder Cande Ruiz was
unanimously’ chosen as a member of
the Big East A11—Rookie team, the
first time a Pitt player ever received
that award. ’

Ruiz led Pitt in all offensive cat-
egories. She had 26 points, includ-

FROM PAGE 8

ing 10 goals and six assists.‘ She‘

also topped the roster with 56 shots
and five game-winning goals while
starting in all 19 of Pitt’s games.

Since Pitt’s program is in just its
third year, Ruiz is also the Panthers’
all-time leaderin each of the offen-
sive categories. . -

Earlier in the season, Ruiz
received Big East Rookie of the
Week honors for her play in against
Big East foe Providence during the
week of‘ Oct. 5. .

Ruiz’s offensive performance
against Wagner in the fourth game

of the year was one of the best by 5

any player in the NCAA this season.
The 10 points she scored on three
goals and four assists ties for first in
the NCAA in points scored in a
game. V
