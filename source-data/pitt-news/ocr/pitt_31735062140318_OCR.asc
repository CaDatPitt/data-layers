On a cold day in the early part
of 1787, there was general con-
fusion among the 130 families that

A made up the village of Pittsburgh.

The towri‘ was going to have a.
new school.

There were, of course, the usual
few who doubted that much good
would come of such goings-on, but
when the door of the log cabin on
what is now Third avenue and
Cherry alley was opened, there
were enthusiastic young men by the
dozen who entered the Pittsburgh
Academy where they were to labor
over “learned languages, English,
and Mathematicks.”

Such was the birth of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The town grew. And the infant
university grew with it, and strode
to such dizzy heights that by 1819,
it had been rechartered as West-
ern University of Pennsylvania,
and Reverend Robert Bruce, a
graduate of far-away University of
Edinburgh, was endeavoring to in-
still traditions of Scottish scholar-
ship into eager frontier minds.

To a building on Duquesne way
now moved the famed WUP.

 

The Pittsburgh Academy, founded in 1787, held its
first classes in the log cabin pictured above in the upper

lefthand corner. Located on what is

Cherry way, the Academy, forerunner of today's University,
was founded by Hugh Henry Braclcenridge, shown at the

top center of the photo-montage.

Then ﬁnancial panic struck the
city. And poverty followed and rav-
aged the lusty young community of
Pittsburgh. A great ﬁre raged and
in an incredibly short time, 20
blocks of the city were swept away.
WUP was leveled.

Ten years later, there was a new
building ready for classes, and the
University, temporarily stopped,
began to build again. By the early
nineties, the University was mov-
ed to old Allegheny, now the North
Side, and the Schools of Law,

Medicine, Pharmacy, Mines and
Dentistry became part of the
school.

Women were making their ap-
pearance on campus by 1895.

Under Samuel Black McCormick
the University moved for the last
time, to the Oakland district, and
the official name became the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Following World War I, men
and women ﬂocked to Pitt. Within
ten years the enrollment had tri-
pled, but things looked bad. Four
times the space they already had
was needed for classrooms, labs,
offices. Debts piled high.

It was then-—when the civic
fathers were just about ready to
give up the idea of ever clearing
the obligations—-that an Iowa-
born educator with an ideal came
to Pittsburgh.

Before many months had passed,

Eton A Cold Day ln 1787..

John Gabbert Bowman had cleared
Pitt of all its debts, and building
proposals were being considered. It
was found that eight or ten large
buildings would be needed at once.

Dr. Bowman proposed one large
structure——its height and propor-
tion symbolizing lasting inspira-
tion, a “symbol of the aspiration of
Pittsburgh from pioneer days to
the present.”

The idea was challenged as im-
practical; but after an intense pro-
gram of convincing by the man
who believed in what he was do-
ing, it was accepted. \

The name “Cathedral of Learn-
ing” was first used in discussio_r_1s
and it stuck. Thus from an idea, the

Architect Charles Z. Klaudel
translated Chancellor Bowman’:
dream into blueprints and draw-
ings; and the building was coll-
structed.

From an enrollment of 2,300 stu-
dents in 1921, when he became
chancellor, Dr. Bowman has seen:
the registration increase to between
13,000 and 14,000 students in all
schools, divisions, and extension
branches.

The budget has balanced every
year.

The material equipment of the
University has been increased ten
times beyond what it was when he
took ofﬁce. The Cathedral has no
debt, Dr. Bowman insisting upon 3
“pay-as-we-go” policy.

Pitt’s faculty now numbers 906
professors, instructors, and special
lecturers. Medals, honorary de-
grees, national oﬁices in profession-
al, scientiﬁc, and learned societiee
have been granted them, and the
inventions and research of the staff
are known the world over. *~

At the lower left hand corner is the Reverend Robert
Bruce, first Chancellor of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania-—-the name under which the University was re-
chartered following its early expansion.

When, in 1845, WUP was leveled by a fire which swept
through twenty blocks of the city, the University was moved

to Allegheny, (now the North Side). The University, as I
was then, is shown at the upper right hand corner.

In 1921, young, energetic idealist John Bowman came
to Pitt from Iowa, began in 1924 an expansive building pro-
gram, which culminated in the construction of Pitt's. na-
tionally famous Cathedral of Learning.

Pitt Observes Charter Day by Work, Dancing

By PAUL E‘. PFISCHNER

Pitt will celebrate its Charter
Day this year by working—-work-
ing on the accelerated summer ses-
sion program, on industrial train-
ing courses, and in national defense

L  classes.

A The only formal celebration will
be the annual Charter Day dance
given by the alumni in the Univer-
sity club tomorrow night.

“With the pressure of the war
and the general crisis in which the
world is involved, I doubt that the

students and Alumni would want
much celebrating," Chancellor
John G. Bowman said.

In former years Charter Day ‘has
meant a weekend of celebration,

the annual Charter Day dance. The
festivities were usually sponsored
by the alumni in collaboration with
the student body.

This ysar, the 155th anniver-
sary of the founding of the Uni-
versity, the only celebration wili
be the dance.

Chancellor Bowman expressed
his opinion about the general state
of the students in connection with
the war:

“The students at Pitt are very
interested in. the war. They are
showing a great intelligence toward
the conﬂict," he said. “They are
‘ready, willing, and able to take
ltheir place in the struggle at any

 31;], njgu_et5,?noted speahemzanda stiixne «1stiat;theyunay'bém§éled:on:’€  ’

He added that the students are
being called upon now.

in his contact with other college
and university presidents, the
Chancellor said that he has been
led to believe that no other insti-
tution has the “excellent attitude”
found here at Pitt.

During the interview Dr. Bow-
man . also commented upon the
studies at the time Pitt was found-
ed in 1787 in comparison with the
curricula of today.

The amount of physics that was
known 155‘ years ago could be
taught in about two months time,

he said, while. the chemistry that
had been pncoverecl by the alchem-

.ists coveredzsix 7ri1bn‘ths..:Then, much

stress was placed upon languages.

nounced that 47 per cent of the
women will be from Pitt, 24 per
cent from PCW, 13 per cent from
Mt. Mercy, seven per cent from
Tech, and the remainder from “de-
partment stores, office buildings,
factories, high schools and other
walks of life.”

Sixty-ﬁve per cent of the Pitt

men or sophomores. Only 31 per
cent of non-Pitt girls will be dates
of upperclassmen, while 64 per cent
of them are dates of lower division

Syka concluded from this that
“upperclassmen know, and sopho-
mores and freshmen haven't found

For Pitt Town Meeting

Finals of the “Extempore Discussion Contest on Inter-American
Problems” will be conducted at Pitt Town Meeting Monday. Scheduled

for 2 :30 o'clock, the meeting will take place in 208 Cathedral.

Approximately 12 students who
have survived the preceding three
rounds will compete. Six students
will be chosen to compete in the
district contest in March against
the winners of ten other schools.

From these district contests, two
students will be chosen as repre-
sentatives for seven regional meet-
ings, and one winner from each re-
gional meet will become a delegate
to the National Intercollegiate Con-
ference on Inter-American affairs
at Washington.

According to present plans, the
delegates will be rewarded this
summer by a tour of the other
American countries.

The contest is sponsored by the
Office of the Coordinator of Inter-
American Affairs through the Na-
tional Public Discussions commit-
tee of which Dr. Alan Nichols, di-
rector of inter-collegiate forensics
at University of South California,
is director.

Letters. . ._

Morale: Spirit

Editor, the Pitt News:

If we used the good old word
“spirit” instead of vaguely talk-
ing about morale, we might save
much time, effort, and typewriter
ribbons’

Morale sounds to us like some-
thing new, a just discovered aid in
war, not exceedingly important-—

‘something like vitamin tablets, nice
to have, but nothing to cry about

if missing. We have even had a

committee appointed to ﬁnd how

much of it we had.

Yet what we really should be
concerned about is spirit—wi1ling-
ness to stay and keep shooting
without any hope of getting away
alive; to do without luxuries, com-
forts, and essentials; to starve, be
cold, feel pain, and yet ﬁght on; to
press the trigger even though your
ﬁngers may be skinned. It is spirit
as ancient as Thermopylae, as mod-
em as Chinese guerillas. ~Madrid
had it, Alcazar also had it.

What use is it for a committee
to try and find out whether we
have guts or not?

If we have the grit, the pluck,
and the will it takes to wage war,
well and good; if we are lacking, a
committee telling us so will not
save us from the disaster and the
defeat to which we are then doom-

every Monday. Wednesday, and Friday of

, the school year except on and during holi-

days. Entered as second class matter on Oc-
tober 24, 1911, at the Pittsburgh Post Oﬁice.

“Rations for defense bonds” will

Expensive favors and elaborate

“defense parties” as each frater-
nity tries to save enough money to
buy a defense‘ bond.

Fraternity houses will become
“army camps for a day” with dec-

as they sing army songs and are
served “army rations.”

:{ Dr. lsaacs “Compile: Classifications

 

 Students forUniversity Defense

Remember the information you
ﬁlled out for the ,defense survey
at re istration for second semes-
ter? , erhaps you have since been
wondering when you will be called
to serve with a bomb squad or act
as a messenger for the university.

Ydu‘ have not been forgotten.
Dr. Asher lsaacs, associate pro-
fessor of economics, explained that
the survey was made to classify all
students according to the service
they would best be able to give to
the University in case of any
emergency. So far first aid classes
3 have been the only groups to or-
) ganize, 100 persons already hav-

«a... ‘vr.’..:.1.ea their training. One
hundred more are now in training.
'-: -On ﬁle are the names of all peo-

ple interested in serving as guides,
in bomb‘ squads, as black-out aides,
messenger aides and others. The
names of all those who know ﬁrst
aid are classiﬁed according to those
who can teach it and those who are
willing to serve on committees.
Another distinct classiﬁcation is
made of students who are willing‘
to give ambulance service and all
students owning cars and willing
to use them when called for.
Left to last are those things not
needed yet or until the near future,

as bicycles, wagons, or motorcy-
cles. '-

“The survey will be ﬁnished in
a comparatively short,’ time,” Dr.
Isaacs declared, “but the survey
committee will not take any initia-
tive in the organizing of these de-
fense groups.” As fast as requests
come in for particular talent they
are ﬁlled.

Fire protection squads are re-
cruited, other committees are being
served, and personnel supplied.

It is then up to these organiza-
tions to take care of black-outs or
to serve the students and faculty in
other ﬁelds of emergency.

John Hopkins Morale  

An article written by a Pitt stu-
dent is what started the ball roll-
ing at John Hopkins university
towards a more organized system
of morale-building and student ci-
vilian defense.

The story, written by Robert
Sullivan, Ed43, appeared in the
John Hopkins News-Letter, official
student newspaper, and outlined
the rapid advances made at" Pitt
along the lines of student defense
organization. A
News-Letter has been making a

survey of “what students in vari-
ous other colleges are doing to
keep in touch with former students
now in the service or any other
movements on the campus in rela-
tion to national defense.”

Sullivan, who met the Hopkins

representative, Corbin Gwaltney,

' at the “Y” convention in Washing-

ton, was asked by Gwaltney to

‘ write an article about defense pro-
gress at Pitt.

His story listed such points in

our defense program as: the book

r so “LEFTY” z:oLKowsKi
, Cnd a s I

A timekeeper’s gun, last Wed-
nesday evening, marked the end of
three collegiate basketball careers.
The Titan-Panther fracas was the
ﬁnal ﬂoor performance in Blue and
Gold varsity uniforms at home for
Larry Paffrath, Ed’ “Lefty” Ziol-
kowski, and Jim Egan. ‘

Had this been a. winning season
for the Carlson crew, the three
seniors might have taken that ﬁnal I

curtain call in a. ﬂurry of national”

publicity. But unfortunately, that
was not the“ case, and the trio had
to bid adieu to the hardwood of the
Stadium Pavilion in a veil of com
parative obscurity. ’

Larry Paifrath came to 'the'Uni-
versity as a much-respected ﬂoor
alumnus of Butler High school. As
early as his sophomore year, But-
ler’s blond giant revealed sparks of
superiority.

In that year, Paffrath broke into
the West Virginia contest, and in
four quick but accurate stabs at
the basket, converted complete de-
feat into a very surprising victory.
Larry repeated the performance
againsta tough Westminster squad,
before the end of his debut cam-'
paign.

game for Westminster by shooting

played his usual steady brand of

‘At last it comes out. An announce-

discovery that there is no Santa
Claus. Doctor Carlson's famed ice
cream eaters don’t eat ice cream
at all’!

Hot chocolate has replaced ice
cream as the diet of the Pitt bas-
lcctballers and all because Doctor
Carlson comes to school in the
morning now instead of in the aft-
ernoon. '

It was formerly the habit of the

Doctor who passed an ice cream
plant on his way to practice in the
afternoon to pick up a few gallons
of ice cream. This was in the days
‘when the players were not too well
nourished and the ice cream pro-
vided a necessary afternoon pickup.

But alas, times and the Doctor’s
schedule changed. He now passes
the ice cream plant early in the

morning and so the players’ diet
has been changed to one of hot
chocolate.

The ice cream eaters have be-
come the hot chocolate imbibers
and another myth has exploded.

Last year, there were too many
top notch basket ‘tossers on the
senior squad for Paffrath to serve
more than spasmodically. At that,
the leaping Larry managed to
amass a ninety plus total in the
season's individual score column.
Earlier in the current campaign,
Paffrath proceeded to toss rapid
ﬁr-e two pointers against any and
all opposition. But with the de-
cline of the team itself, came the
gradual decrease of Larry's scor-
ing mania. ,

served as scoring pivot for Palf-
-rath, who this year was his cap-
taining partner. “Lefty” ‘has al-
ways been a player of the hard
working, steady variety. But his
lack of spectacular-ity this year
may well be due to the team’s me-
diocre output. ‘ “
Jim Egan in high school, was an
important member of Claysville’s

7 championship quintet. Egan was

regarded as a ﬂoorman with many
and great possibilities. But for rea-
sons, perhaps unknown, the Clays-
ville sparker failed to live up to
expectations in collegiate competi-
tion.

A season of surprises and disap-
pointments ends tomorrow night
when Pitt’s gallant, but hot and
cold, basketball teamﬂmeets Army
on the ‘latter’s court. The Army will
still have a battle with the Navy
coming up following the Panther
contest, but for the Blue and Gold
it will mark the finish of 3 season

that might have gone down in the

records as one of‘ the greatest in .

Pitt cage history. Instead, however,
it will ring down the curtain on a
season loaded with disappoint-
mentspyand heartbreak.

Although tomorrow night's game
means very little as far as the rec-
ord goes, it .is certain that the
Carlsonmen will be giving their all
for a victory. That they haven't

given up trying, despite the fact
that after the middle of the season
they weren't going anywhere,_ is
easily seen by the gallant and spec-
tacular ﬁght they put up last Wed-

nesday -night against a powerful
Westminster team.

Trailing and thoroughly outplay-
ed in the ﬁrst half of the game by
the Titans, the Panthers came back
in the second half to send shivers

through Grover Washabaugh and
his team. The valiant effort fell

brand of basketball during the past
year, while Egan again showed
signs of greatness, but never reach-

Local Squad C5iven Little Chance

Without Services

By VINCE QUATRINI

of "Hap" Stickel

A crippled, injury-ridden Panther track team takes on
a conditioned Michigan Wolverine pack at Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, tomorrow afternoon in a dual meet as the Jungle Cats for
the ﬁrst time this season venture into the contest as the un-

derdogs.

Even though the locals are tagged as not having a chance,

there is still an opening for a

probable, but not impossible for
Coach Olson and Co. to win with-
out the presence of speed merchant
“Hap” Stickel, who is one of the
reasons for the Olsonmen’s success
thus far in the campaign.

With victories chalked. up over
Michigan Normal, Michigan State
and Notre Dame, the Wolverines
present a formidable record for the
Blue and Gold to beat. However,
Coach Ken Doherty isn’t afraid of
suchan event happening with the
crop of stars that he has pounding
the boards for Michigan.

Spearheading the attack for the
Wolverines will be Ufer, a spiker
from Mt. Lebanon high school.
While in high school he burned the
cinders in such an impressive man-
ner that Michigan scouts carried
him off to the northern school.
Ufer was the speed demon who
was instrumental in clipping the
highly touted Notre Dame indoor
men. Obviously, he will be the
man to watch for he is’ versatile,
participating in the 440, some of
the dashes and on-the mile relay

I team. . --

In the sprints, another danger-
ous man is Thomas, Ufer’s side-
kick. Against both the Irish and
Michigan State he whipped the best
they had to offer. A majority of the
Big Ten conference schools con-
sider Thomas as the outstanding
sprinter in the circuit. He is also
“poison” in the high jump.

Hirsch will ﬁgure as the main-

. stay in the Wolverine’s ﬁeld events.

Big Ten sports scribes have label-
ed him the chief contender for the
conference shot-put title.

Topping the high timbers for
the Wolverines will be McCarthy,
who also‘ doubles in the role of a
broad. jumper. Coach Ken Doherty
has Leonardi, Roxbury, and Kautz
for the two-mile affair, and Mor-
ley in the 440.

All in all, the Panthers are in

major upset. lt is highly im-

for a busy afternoon for their op-
ponent, Michigan, is reputed to
have the best indoor squad in the
Big Ten. '
Coach Carl Olson will take the
same team that he took to Ohio
State last week with the“ excep-
tion of Stickel. On the Jungle Cats’
roster are listed 18 indoor men.

The relay squad will consist of
Logan, Peretic, Smith and Carter
with Carter also doing duty in the
broad jump, and the dashes. Per-

etic and Smith will also perform ,

in the quarter mile.

In the distance races Coach 01-
son has Bill Curtis, Wiley, Winch,
Bob Davis, Mark Allias, Nikos,
Miller and McGibbney. Those card-
ed for the sprints include Peretic,
Smith and Norton while Cooper,
Campbell, Winch, Benghauser,
Rhoades, Jessup and Medlock are
entered in the ﬁeld games.

Physicians Plan
Hospital at Pitt  

Forty "faculty members of the
University School of Medicine, who
organized a base hospital two years
ago, are planning toward the time
when the hospital's operation will
be ordered.

When the call comes, the physi-
cians will 'give up their private
practices, which in many cases
have taken years to build, and
take the base hospital into what-

’ ever war theater the army assigns
‘ them. -

The unit also planned to recruit
120 nurses from the Red Cross re-
serve, and permit them to join the
hospital as second lieutenants.

Dr. Harry Edgar Feather, direc-
tor of the Pitt unit, will become a
lieutenant-colonel and the other
physicians will assume proportion-
ate rank.

Mermen Trounce Kenyon,-

Oberlin Faces Pitt Today

Pitt's aquatic squad chalked up
victory number four last Wednes-
day afternoon at the expense of
the Kenyon college mermen, 39%-
29 ‘A-.‘ 7

Once again it was the junior
sensation Gus Wilde that led the

way to the Pitt win, this time he 4

won the 220-yard free style race
in 2:29 minutes and 100-yard free
style race in 55.2. Both races were
negotiated in very good time.

Captain Herb Cosgrove won his
specialty, 220 breast stroke, for
the fourth time this season, this
time nipping his opponent, Hen-
schel, by scant inches in the time
of 2:34. --

It was Pitt’s meet all the way as
they lost only the diving contest
and the 440-yard freestyle race.
Both relay races, the 440-yard free
style and the 300-yard medley re-
lay were dead heats.

An unusual occurrence happen-
ed in the ﬁnal race when both
Kenyon and the Panther relay
teams were disqualiﬁed.

Joe Orloif won the second race
of the afternoon when Captain Ty-

Phi Ciamma Delta Wins ll: All-Point
Trophy For Third Consecutive Year

By MIKE HERMAN
Simultaneous with the Interfra-

ternity swimming meet, which
marks the start of a new year for
the fraternity athletes, the Intra-
mural oﬂice announced that Phi
Gamma Delta had won the All-
Point trophy for the 1941-1942 sea-
son with a total of 596% points.
In second place came Phi Delta
Theta with 568 points and in third
was Pi Kappa Alpha, only two
scant points behind the Phi Delta.
The PiKA’s had 566, and at ﬁrst
reckoning had taken second place.
A post-season checkup, however,
showed that they had lost 5 points
on a paddle tennis forfeit, and as
a result were dropped to third.

This is the third consecutive time
the Phi Gams have taken the “Big
Cup,” and since an all-point award
has been made for only the last
ﬁve years, the Fijis have a big
edge over all the other houses on
campus.

The first trophy was taken by the
now defunct Kappa Sig house at
the end of the ’37—’38 season. The
1938-39 cup went to the Phi Delts,
but after that, the other houses
haven’t had a look-in as far as this
honor was concerned, with the Phi
Gams showing their heels to the
pack since then.

.ln taking the Trophy, the
champs won a total of-ﬁve firsts,

never forfeiting. A rare thing, in-
deed, is a Phi Gam forfeit.

The most lucrative ﬁrst taken by
the Fijis was the outdoor track
toga in which they received 68
points. In this meet they topped off
an extremely satisfactory after-
noon’s Work with a ﬁnal victory in

the 440-yard relay, beating out Del-

ta Tau Delta and PiKA for the all
important points. Featured\for the
winners were Earl Pressel, Cliff
Potter, Jim Warne, and Jack
“Stoney” Bitner.

The first three sports opened to
the fraternities last spring were
taken by the Wallingford Street
gang. The swimming title, their
ﬁrst of the year, was taken by a
two-point margin over second-
place PiKA, with Bitner, Potter,
Mike Mitchell, and Bill Colvin lead-
ing the way.’

This was followed by the track
victory, and then the Sweepstakes

win when driver Colvin steered the .

champs into a 30-point bonus.
Fourth Phi Gam title was taken
in paddle tennis, and then followed
by the usual Phi Gam victory in‘
volleyball. It is interesting to note
that the fraternity champs h ve
Won the volleyball crown every
year since it was ﬁrst started four
years ago. This year’s squad listed
Ken Grossett, Bill Colvin, J r.,iDave

Phi Gamma Delta took seconds in
golf and speedball, and third po-
sitions in mushball, basketball, and
table tennis.

Interfraternity Council has or-
dered trophies for the following:
volleyball, ﬁrst and second place;
table tennis, ﬁrst and second
place; Football, ﬁrst, second and
third places; basketball, ﬁrst, sec-
ond and third places; and bowling,
ﬁrst, second and third places,
Awards will be made tonight at

ler of the Kenyon aggregation took
the lead, and with a ﬁnal burst of
speed overtook him at the ﬁnish
line. The time for the 50-yard free
style race was 24.8.

Al Samson, unheralded Pitt
swimmer, took over Keulon in the
150-yard breast stroke race, mark-
ing the first time this season that
the Kenyon star has met defeat.

The Pitt mermen will meet the
Oberlin college squad tonight at
the Pittsburgh Athletic Associa-
tion pool at 8:15 o’clock.

MARIAN BOGGS
in anniversary play

By ED ROSE

Twenty-ﬁve years ago, a Pitts-
burgh newspaperman, Joseph R.
Gousha, assigned to cover the pre-
sentation of two one-act plays in
Trees gymnasium by a group of
University students wrote, “The
performance marked the birth of
the experimental theater in Pitts-
burgh. ’

“This spirit of advance points to
the theater of tomorrow and should
carry the Pitt Players far and es-
tablish them as a factor in the dra-
matic activities of the city. Spirit
such as this is insuring the pro-
gress of the American theater.”

.Thus was born the present act-
ing group, Pitt Players, who this
year celebrate their twenty-ﬁfth

' anniversary by presenting ﬁve per-

formances of “The Women,” a
radical departure from the usual
two performances. Four perform-
ances will be be given in Foster Me-
morial auditorium on March 11, 12,
13, and the last performance which
is exclusively for the faculty and

their friends will be presented
March 14.

In keeping with the spirit of the
times Pitt Players will travel to
Indiantown Gap. to present “The
Women” before an audience of sol-
diers on March 20. This is Pitt
Players’ contribution to army mor-
ale as well as a means of celebrat-
ing their anniversary. ‘

 
    

Professor George M. Baird or-
ganized the ﬁrst acting group in
1917. Fifteen students joined the

group and bore the entire expenses

of the ﬁrst production including,

costumes, makeup, and scenery.
Footlights and backdrop were elim-
inated and the settings were of the
utmost simplicity, an application of
the principals of the “experimen-
tal” play which the Pitt Players
have produced frequently since
then. ‘

“Deirdre” a product of the Cel-
tic renaissance, and “Esther” writ-
ten by director Baird were the ﬁrst
plays to be presented by the group.
Player enthusiasts will remember
“Our Town,” “Adding Machine,”
and “Flight to The West” as some
of the more recent “experimental”
dramas given by the group.

The dramatic so_ciety formed by
Professor Baird in 1917 was reor;
-ganized in 1920 under the depart-
ment of public speaking and /in
1924 it began a regular program
of presenting three or four major
productions each year. Productions
were given in a variety of build-
ings for many years.

In Heinz house the actors per-
formed on a movable stage and
plays were also given in the Irene
Kaufmann Settlement, YM&YW-
HA, Falk Elementary school, Frick
Teachers’ Training school, the
Schenley hotel theater, and the
Pittsburgh Playhouse. Today all
productions are presented in the
Stephen Foster Memorial audito-
rium. » A

Graduate‘ Student
Studies Holders
of Scholarships

What becomes of “exceptionally
able” high school graduates?

David Henderson, Pitt graduate

has answered this question by mak- *

ing a study of youths‘ of unusual
intelligence» who, from 1921 to

1935, were honored by the Alle-

gheny County Civic club for their
scholastic ability.

From questionnaires sent to 460
youths and answered by 308, Hen-
derson found that after graduat-
ing from college, more than two-
thirds of these persons were never
unemployed. More than half of
those unemployed stated that they
had been jobless for periods ofrless
than four months.

About 63 per cent of the ex-
ceptional students were employed
at occupations for which they had
prepared themselves at college.
Ninety-two of them had received
pay raises or promotions since
they began working.

More than half of those survey-
ed reported that they weretaking
part in community service activi-

ties, including church, scout, civic,

and social club work.
