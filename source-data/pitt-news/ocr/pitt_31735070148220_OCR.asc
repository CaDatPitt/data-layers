Pitt’s tuition rate will go up this
year — how much, though, is still
undecided. *

. The tuition increases for in-
state students, the majority of
students at Pitt, depend on one
of three proposed funding cuts
ﬂoated by the two legislative
branches and the governor.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees will
meet on Friday to pass a budget
for the 2011-12 school year that
normally includes the price of
tuition. Pitt’s budget will not be
deﬁnite, however; because-the
state legislature _has not passed
its budget yet. The state has a
constitutionally-mandated June
30 deadline for its budget, but
that doesn’tmean a decision is
guaranteed, asthe state has fre-
quently breezed past the date in
the past 10 years. ~

The board might waitto pass
a budget -— and raise tuition —‘—
until the state passes its budget,
although it does not always do
so. In 2009, the board increased
tuition in July, but with a condi-
tion; tuition might go up more if
Pitt received less in state or fed-
eral stimulus funding than the
University counted on.

Fedele said that the board
likely will not act the same way
it did in 2009. i

_ “We haven’t been able to pass
a budget at the June Board meet-
ing for many years.'As such, the
annual operating and capital bud-
gets, along with the tuition~rate

schedules, have been passed in -‘

July or later by the Budget Com-
mittee of the Board,” Fedele
said. ' ’ g _

Pitt’s in-state tuition is correlated to state appropriations for higher education and will likely increase with the dramatic reduction instate funding.

appropriations request’ to the
Commonwealth last September,
it said it would cap tuition in-
creases at 4 percent if the state
increased the institution’s fund-
ing by 5 percent. But no matter

which branch ofthe Pennsylvania '
. state government gets ‘its way,

Pitt’s funding will be decreased,
meaning tuition will likely rise
more than 4 percent.
“Obviously we'are not get-
ting a 5 percent increase, butif
we did it would still be true that
we would hold tuition increases

to 4 percent,” Fedele said in an

email.
Even thought nothing is ﬁnal-
ized, it’s deﬁnite that Pitt faces a

 

reduction in its state appropria-
tion. When the governor first in-
troduced his proposal in March,

the largest of the three proposed ‘

cuts, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg said that such cuts would
mean an increase in tuition for
Pitt students. , I
The governor’s proposal would
halve Pitt’s total funding, the state
Senate’s bill would cut it by about
15, and the‘House’s bill would cut
it by 25 percent. However, the

governor’s proposal has become ‘
increasingly less likely, as legisla- .

tors from both parties have come
out in opposition of the bill. The

iﬁlnalbudget will need approval by

both parts of the’ legislature and

A a signaturelfrom the governor to
. become law. ' e

In addition to state cuts, Pitt
also loses more than $20 million
in federal stimulus funds for the
next ﬁscal year. Last year, Pitt
received $184 million in state

and federal appropriations. The’

state gave $160 million, and the
remainder came from stirnulus
funds. The state proposals work

, off of the0$160 million appro-

priation.

The state appropriations that
Pitt receives are meant to help
state—related universities lower
the cost of tuition for in-state

' students. University officials

have repeatedly said that the less

funding Pitt receives, the more
in-state tuition will rise. Pitt’s‘
money, along with the appropria-
tions for Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln Universities,_ are separate
from the 14 universities in the

State System of Higher Educa— ‘

tion. _

State Sen. Jake Corman (R-
Bellefonte) sponsored the Sen-
ate’s budget proposal, which had
the lowest cuts at 15 percent. He
said hewanted the funding for
state—related universities to be
as high as possible.

higher education, and the amount

Alcohol amnesty policy not B for all underagers

Mallory Grossman ‘

News Editor

An alcohol amnesty bill passed by the state
Senate, if approved, might not protect intox-
icated underage students from university-
sanctioned discipline.

The bill, called the Good Samaritan Bill,
will grant amnesty to the person who calls
emergency services, but not to the person in
need of medical attention. It does not pro-
tect either person from university judiciary

systems, but stipulates that -the person who »
calls must provide his name to emergency -

services and stay with the intoxicated person
until medical help arrives.

Pitt continues to remain mum on its
position with respect to the bill, as spokes-
man John Fedele said the University has no
comment on the issue, although its passage
would bring about a change in Pitt’s policy.
University officials have said that if Pitt po-

lice come across an underage student drink- .

referred to the Student Judiciary Board —
regardless of whether the minor was seeking
medical attention at the time.

The bill, which the Senate passed in
May, was sponsored by Republican legis-
lators, including state Sen. John Rafferty
(R-Montgomery) and state Senxjange Orie
(R-Allegheny and Butler). The measure will
need approval from the state House and
governor before becoming law.

Sean Moll, legislative assistant for Raf-
ferty, said that based on the Senate’s legisla-

tion, immunity is only speciﬁcally given to
the person who dials 911 ‘because the law-
makers wanted to help save lives.

“Life and death — it really comes down
to someone doing the right thing,” Moll
said. 5

“‘Well I don’t know if I should call — I
won’t get in trouble but they will:’ At that
point, they have to use their good judgment
and call despite that.”

Bill meant as

Amnesty  2

The intoxicatedperson might ‘also face

disciplinary action from his school. “It’s
university discretion whether the person will
be prosecuted. Ultimately, immunity will be

' to the person who dials 911,” Moll said.

A Cornell University study found that
after implementing an alcohol amnesty pro-
gram_on campus, calls to emergency medi-

cal services and hospital emergency rooms

due to alcohol intoxication increased. The
study did notﬁnd that drinking on campus
increased.

‘Sean Moll:

preventative measure

o ' '«

Orie said the bill will ensure that the pre-
ventive measure is implemented in colleges
and universities across the state. As of now,
Carnegie Mellon and Temple universities
both have amnesty policies in place, while
Pitt does not. .

Moll said this bill was ﬁrst introduced in
2009 after legislators held a hearing with
some of the schools and colleges in Pennsyl-
vania, including Pitt. They had a hearing on
different alcoholtopics and decided to 'act

"upon a blanket amnesty policy.

Although it seems like We are
ignoring the law, What’s more

person gets help.

According to the study, alcohol—related
EMS calls increased by 22 percent over the
ﬁrst two years of the amnesty program. In
2000, before the policy was in place, 3.8
percent of students said that they did not

call EMS for help with an intoxicated friend '

because they did not want to get their friend
in trouble. This dropped down to 1.5 per-

-cent in 2004, two years after the program

started. _ .
Orie said that she co—sponsored the bill
because of the stories she often hears about
minors drinking, becoming unconscious and
sometimes dying while no onecalls for help
because they fear legal repercussions.
“The whole point behind this, although
I’m not encouraging drinking, is to protect

A the welfare of students on campuses and

encourage students if they feel that person is

' in need of medical attention to notify-emer~ -~

gency services,” Orie said.

portant to Sen. Rafferty is that a

Kristin Kanthak, a political science pro-
fessor at Pitt, said that conservatives are
pushing this bill through because they see
it as a public safety issue. ' ' L

She compared this alcohol amnesty bill‘

to other amnesty bills that could also be said
to overlook lawbreaking. .

‘ _“I know there are a lot of ‘different types
of amnesty legislation that are aimed at try-
ing to get_people to behave appropriately in
situations when appropriate behavior would
reveal that they were doing something they
shouldn’t have,” Kanthak said.

The alcohol amnesty bill could be said to
help people in the same way.

“Although it seems like we are ignoring’

the law,‘ what’s more important to Sen. Raf-
ferty is that a person gets help. Iffhey’re in

Port Authority trial over

Alex Oltmanns
Assistant News Editor

It was a smooth ride for Port Authority’s test run
of new fare—collect1'on equipment, and students
will now have to tap theirID cards to board abus
once the new system takes effect in August

The four-week trial program, which ended
last Friday, tested new technology that uses fare
boxes to read microchips in student ID cards as
passengers board the buses. .

Port Authority spokesmanjim Ritchie praised
the results of the trial. “It went well. It went as we
expected it to,” Ritchie said.

The pilot process tested the cards of about220
participants —— all Pitt students and staff— who
hadthe chip intheirIDs activatedtoseeifthefare
box systems could accurately read them.

Ritchie said the problem with the old system
was that, withso many cardholders often board-

ingthebusatonce, the driverhad nowayofknow- ‘
A ing which IDs were expired.

“Once you’re no longer avalid ID holder at the
University, you don’tgetto use the system in_that
way anymore,” Ritchie said. “Duringthe course of
-theyear, students come and go. Students graduate,
faculty comes and goes, so there needs to be an
accurate system in place between the University
and Port Authority that lets our system know
who is a valid ID holder and who is not a valid

’ ID holder.”

“The system is in place so that the fare boxes

will recognize those changes,” he said, although
he didn’t know exactly how the process for ex-
pired cards would work or how cards would be
deactivated once the expiration date hits.
Underthe old system, people with avalid Pitt

‘ ID, who include faculty, staif and currentstudents,

would simplyﬂash theircardtothe driver and pro-
ceed onto the bus. The new system now requires
card holders to swipe their card as they pass the
fare box. The system is also designed to speed up
the process of students boarding buses.
“Ithinkittakes alotless timetotap your card
and continuewalkingonto the vehiclethan it does
to slide a couple dollars and some change into the
fare box,” Ritchie said. ' .
But Pitt students aren’t in total agreement.
What Ritchie failed to add was that students
do nottake the timeto pay the driver, they simply
havetoﬂashtheirll) andwalkaway——~ aprocess
that takes only seconds.
“I think itwill deﬁnitely take more time for a
machine to read your ID,” senior Kevin Francis

' said. “Iridethebustoworkallthetimeanddon’t

see a real problem with the way it is right now.”

' , Fellow Pitt student Andy Kalas — a rising
graduate student — said he thinks the system
is a welcome improvement, but has some draw-
backs as well.

“Whatwould they'do if a student’s card didn’t
work correctly or something? That would hold
things up, and I would hate to see a student not
be able to get transportation due to machine
failure.” ﬂ ‘ ‘

Budget cuts will  

decide in—state tuition  

Budget < 1

of tax dollars that we invest in state-related
universities we can see the tremendous
beneﬁt that students get,” Corman said.
Corman is aware that any cut in fund-
ing will have an impact on the. students,

. especially through the rising price of tu-

ition. But he said that his bill is better than
the 52 percent funding cut that Gov. Tom
Corbett proposed in March, which would
leave Pitt with only $80 million in state
appropriations.

Kevin Harley, the governor’s spokes-
man, told The Pitt News in March that
Corbett’s proposed cuts would be the first
step in changing the formula for the fu-
ture on funding for higher education. He
said Corbett wanted to fund the students
rather than the universities, which he said
have not been held accountable for yearly
tuition increases.

The House bill, which was sponsored by
state Rep. William Adolph (R—Delaware),

will restore $45.7 million to Gov. Cor- -

bett’s proposal, giving Pitt 75 percent of

the funding it received this year. With this’,

bill, Pitt would get $125.9 million from the
state, a reduction from the $160 million
Pitt received this year. 5

Mike Stoll, a spokesman for Adolph,
said that the legislature was surprised by
the amount of cuts Corbett proposed for
higher education.

“By and large, the legislature feels that
higher education is something that is a
priority and is also something that is im-
portant as wefre trying to prepare Pennsyl-
vania students to enter a very competitive
workforce that is a global workforce now,”
Stoll said.

However, Stoll said that one very im-
portant factor in the state budget is the $3
billion that the Commonwealth lost this
year in federal funding, $100 million of
which went to higher education.

“While we have limited resources com-
pared to last year, the legislature still felt
higher education needed to be a priority
and shouldn’t have_ to deal with magni-
tude of cuts proposed by the governor,”

Stoll said. E

of the Graduate School of Public'Health,
Burke continues to do research.

He said his current research focuses

and usingthe results of those models to
ﬁnd the best possible way to respond to
potential epidemics — “epidemiology in
silicon” as he referred to it.

Klunk, workingin partnership with Pitt
professor of radiology Chester Mathis,
developed a new imaging technique that
allows for the-detection of certain plaque
deposits in the brain that develop in Al-

zheimer’s patients before any symptoms .

of the disease appear. Klunk said that his

technique is currently being used in drug
trials that could help treat Alzheimer’s.

“Our goal isn’t to give people bad news
earlier and leave them hanging,” he said.
“We want to get them good news.” _

Billiar is’ a surgeon who works in the

Although Gronenborn and Strick are
the only two Distinguished Professors
this year who are not medical doctors,
they both focus their research on human
health. . '

Gronenborn studies structural biol- .

ogy, which looks at the three—dimensional
shapes of molecules and how these shapes
affect the way molecules function.
Gronenborn’s work has unlocked the
shape of a number of different proteins,
including some related to HIV and AIDS.
Strick’s work focuses on neurobiol-

_ ogy, speciﬁcally how the cerebral cortex

controls iioluntary motion. According to
the press release, Strick has discovered
six different brain areas that play a role
in motion. »

The press release also said thafhis re-
search ‘on’ certain circuits could unlock
the causes of schizophrenia, depression,
autism and obsessive—compulsive disor-
der.

Strick was abroad when asked for com-‘
ment on the story and said that he was
unaware he even obtained the title.

Gronenborn did not respond to re-
quests for comment, and Billiar declined
to comment. .

For Klunk and Burke, it sufficed to say
their work isn’t over.

Burke,'who took the position of dean
five years ago, said he-envisions Pitt rising
from national prominence to international
prominence in medical research. He said

his other main goal is to direct medicine ’
‘ towards under—privileged populations and

ﬁght pre-mature mortality.

A Klunk wants to branch out from Al— .
’ zheimer’s research and develop ‘similar

imaging techniques for other kinds of

' dementia.

He also wants to develop treatments
for a special group of Alzheimer’s patients
who develop the disease_in their 30s and
40s. _ V

. “It just calls. out for treatment. I want
to see if we can help this special group of
people,” he said. ﬂ ' l ‘ ‘

Conﬁdence, as your gym teacher
might have told you, is everything
.—-'the make-or-break between suc-
cess and failure,

But according to Jean Twenge ‘

and her colleagues, we’ve tran-
scended a healthy self-assurance
and become downright delusion-
al. ' »
Twenge, a professor of psychol-
ogy at San Diego State University,
has made a living out ofbemoaning
our generation’s self-centeredness
4 most recently with her 2007
book “Generation Me_: Why Today’s
Young Americans Are More Con-

ﬁdent, Assertive, Entitled — and

More Miserable Than Ever Before.”
Now, in keeping with her research
focus, she and her colleagues have
published a study in the British
journal Self and Identity suggest-
ing college freshman are, in several
respects, “overconﬁdent.”

The study a grounded in data
from UCLA’s annualsurvey of col-
lege freshmen — found that a
growing number» of young adults
consider themselves superior to
their peers in numerous categories.
When it comes to soclialself-conﬁ-
dence, for instance, roughly 50 per-
cent of freshmen in 2009 deemed
themselves “above average,” as
opposed to less than one—third in
1966, the ﬁrst year the survey was
conducted. Perhaps more signiﬁ-
cantly, 60 percent claimed to be
more intellectually “self—conﬁdent”
than average,- compared with 39
percent in 1966. .

There’s a host of factors we
could attribute to this spike in
assuredness: doting parents, an
increased emphasis on the unique-
ness of every individual, more in-
sular upbringings. The research-
ers, for their part, believe grade
inﬂation is partly to blame: In their
study, they note that in 1966, only
19 percent of surveyed students
earned an A or A- average in high
school, compared with 48 percent
in 2009. Ultimately, however,
there’s no one factor we can im-
mediately isolate.

What we can deﬁnitively say is

that the personalities detailed in
this study -— hyperbolically self-as-
sured teenagers and twentysome—
tliings —- do exist on a signiﬁcant
scale. Especially in specialized or
honors courses, it’s not uncommon
to encounter students who believe
they are far and above the most
qualiﬁed people in the classroom.

' Of course, this isn’t entirely a
bad thing: As Meredith College
professor Deborah Tippett told the
Associated Press, such “overcon-
ﬁdence” can facilitate impressive

student undertakings. Tippett has A

one pupil, for instance, overseeing

. the construction of an orphanage

for AIDS-infected children in Africa
— a feat that undoubtedly requires
more than a little self-conviction’.

Nevertheless, a generation in
which everyone considers himself
superior to everyone else is inher-
ently untenable: Sometime or an-
other, those with “above average”
intellectual self-conﬁdence will
encounter a professor _unwilling
to sustain their -self-perceptions;
sometimes, in fact,‘ all that’s needed
to deﬂate an ego is a B. And when
such fantasies are shattered, there’s
no telling how people will react. If
Twenge’s assertions are to be trust-
ed, nearly all students arebound
for brutal disillusionment. b

As Tippett herself noted, teach-
ing students with inﬂated self-con-
ﬁdence can be singularly difﬁcult.
“They really do believe they can
do it all,” she told the Associated
Press. “It makes them wonderful,
but it also makes for some hard
lessons.” ‘ - I

None of us are immune to delu-
sions of grandeur, and sometimes
they lead to concrete accomplish-

_ ments. More frequently, however,

they’re poisonous — especially
once we’re submerged in unfor-

. ‘giving professional environments.

Here’s hoping, then, that we’ll be
able to bear our so—called “hard
lessons” when they do occur.

If you’ve already realized all
this, give yourself a pat on the back:
It takes an above-average intellect
to come to such conclusions. .

When I was a senior in high school,
I was one of 48 finalists in a state-
wide scholarship competition. The
actual scholarship wasn’t much —
only $500. The program was more
about the prestige of being named,
essentially, one of the top all-around
students in Nebraska.

During the awards ceremony,
where. the committee handed “out
the eight scholarships, I noticed
that every non-white student re-
ceived one. Well, every non-white
student except me. Granted, I’m
only half non-white, and my name
doesn’t exactly signal “child of
Asian immigrant.” Still, I wonder
if I would have won had I chosen
to write my essay on my illiterate
Chinese grandmother instead of my
insatiable quest for knowledge.

’ I’m not saying that those minor-
ity students weren’t well-qualiﬁed
for their scholarships; I’m just won-
dering'if they had an edge.

This is what The New York

-Times askedin its June 13 article,

“On College Forms, a Question of
Race, or Races, Can Perplex.’.’ Stu-
dents with more than one heritage
often agonize over the best way to
represent their race —- combine it

the right way, and it could mean the
difference between an acceptance
letter and rejection.

- “It pains me to say this, but put-
ting down black might help my ad-
missions chances and putting down
Asian might hurt it,” one student
interviewed for the story said.

As someone who’s mixed-race,

‘ I’d_be lying if I said I hadn’t tried to
use my diverse genes to jump ahead
of my pure—blooded peers. After
simply checking “Asian” in high
school (in Nebraska, that’s a plus),
I saw the advantage my parentage
gave me as awareness of mixed-race
people began to rise. Whenever an
application asked howl was going
to promotediversity — which it
always did — I exploited every nu-
ance of my childhood. The summary
of any essay I wrote boiled down to:
“My mom’s Chinese, but my dad’s

white. Hijinks ensued, and now I’m- '

a better person than someone who’s
‘just’ Chinese or ‘just’ white.”
But I’m not.
Determining which “mix” of
. races is the most advantageous is an
incorrect way to promote diversity. I
think colleges have good intentions;
people with diverse backgrounds
can often ‘lend afresh perspective in
ethnically rigid environments. But
that’s not always the case. ‘
When friends were discussing

MCT Campus

Mixed races can mislead

the role of helicopter parents, I
chimed in with my experiences
as the child of a tiger mother, and

whenever the topic of religion‘

comes up, I almost always incor-
porate my upbringing as a pastor’s
daughter, but the diversity of my
background isn’t due to my mixed-
race heritage. Not all tiger mothers
are Chinese, and not all pastors are
third-generation German immi-
grants. When colleges rely solely
on race to determine a student’s
diversity value, they’re only helping
to create a society in which a per-
son’s race is more important than
the person herself. '

I’m not denying the importance

of initiatives to encourage minority
students..I_’m just sick of living in an
environment that places the most
value on what boxes I check in the
race portion of the U.S. Census.

In the Times ‘article, colleges
admit that multiple races could
give students an edge. But that
attitude leads to a slippery slope.
“The new options have forced col-
leges to confront thorny questions,
including how_ to account for vari-
ous racial mixes in seeking diversity
on campus. Is a student applying as
black and Latino more desirable in
terms of diversity than someone
who is white and black? Or white

The Oakland Shakespeare Co.
does it quick and dirty — “King
Lear,” that is.

With an intense four-week
rehearsal process behind them,
the theatre undergraduate and
graduate students will perform
their play onjune 26 and 27 with
the Cathedral of Learning’s load-
ing clock as their stage. ‘

The play is set in a dark and un-

deﬁnedperiod in England. It tells

the tale of the fall of a king and
his people through multiple com-

plicated plot twists. The elderly ’
King Lear wishes to retire from .
' his throne and divide his wealth

among his three daughters. The
majority of the play’s action stems
from this central dynamic» ,

In April, directorjordan Mat-
thew Walsh got the -idea for the
Pitt-based group to take on the
dark father/daughter tragedy,
despite the company’s time- and
location-related limitations.
Whereas the Pitt Repertory The-
atre put on “As You Like It” this
spring with six weeks of rehearsal
time, “King Lear” had to be devel-
oped in just four.

“[The making of this particu-

' lar show] was interesting because

the staff really worked with ev-

E eryone’s availability,” Julie Anne

Evans, almember of the show’s
ensemble, said.

Aside from time constraints,
the company’s other diﬂiculty was
ﬁnding space. By'electing to stage

‘ the production at the loading dock
of the Cathedral (on the Forbes‘

Avenue side of the building) rath-
er than on a conventional stage,
the cast and crew have developed
a rugged alternative to the theater
experience, Walsh said.
“Personally, I think it’s a
great place for the play to hap-
pen,” Walsh said in an email. “It
has distinct character, and it ﬁts
nihilistic themes in the play. The

i play hurts more when the war,

violence and bloodshed aren’t
for control of the glorious ﬁelds
and castles of England but over
two Dumpsters on a dirty slab of
concrete. The clock has also added
a lot to the actors’ performances.
They’ve really been able to draw
on the darkness and violenceof
the space itself.” _

Walsh and the actors have
found that the industrial aspects
of the area — two mechanical
doors, two -raised platforms, a
cement ﬂoor and two Dumpsters
—— enhance the performance.

Randi Alu
Staﬂ"Writer

Ibegan mourningthis weekend, after
the 10th and ﬁnal episode of the ﬁrst
season of “Game ofI‘hrones” aired on
HBO. The second seasonwillnotpre-
rniere until next summer, and .I had
just come off the withdrawal shakes

from the end of the ﬁrst season of
AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” Oh, TV,

how you destroy me.

It occurred to me then that there
must be something out there forfans
of aTV show during its downtime. I’ve
put together a list of a few strategies
to help watchers cope with the pain
of waiting for the next season of a
favorite series.

Read it:

As they say on the Internet, “Ev-
ery repost is a repost of a repost.”
Although inﬁiriating when trying
to ﬁnd a shred oforiginal content,
this truth is good news for those of
us who ﬁnd ourselves pining for our
beloved storylines, because, behold:
They have been adapted from some-
thing else.

As for my favorites, “Game of
Thrones” is based on a book series
by George R. R. Martin titled “A Song

of Ice and Fire.” “A Game ofThrones”
is the ﬁrst book in that series. Like-

wise, “The Walking Dead” was a trade
comic series that now can be found in,._,_

apaperback compendium. _

Your favorite show probably came
from a print version ﬁrst too —' or
even a remake or spin-off of an older
movie orTV series. Have at it, and be
relieved until the next season is avail-
able to be visually devoured.

Research it:

Along those same lines, chances
are that the director, actors, writers,
etc., have worked on other_projects.
To ﬁnd those, IMDb and Netflix are
your best friends.,Search to your,
heart’s content. s

Although what you’ll ﬁnd will be a‘
bit different from the exact showyou
were watching, you’ll see otherworks,
and tl1ey’ll likely contain some of that
person’s quintessential characteris-
tics that you’ve come to love. Andwho°.
knows, you might ﬁnd that your show
has a pairing like the Tim Burton/

“Green Lantern”

It’s practically summer protocolto have

And that’s because it’s the typical
summer movie, typical superheroflick,
typical Ryan Reynolds character. The
overwhelming average-ness of it all is a
bit frustrating. There’s really no artistic
interpretation; it’s a safe ﬁlm. It hides
behind the conventions of previous su-
perhero movies, and therein lie its assets
and pitfalls.

“Green Lantern” details the origin of .

the ﬁrst human Green Lantern, Haljordan

the Green Lantern story arc. For those who

are unfamiliar,-the Green Lanterns are

like a police force for outer space, using
superpowered rings from analien race.
The ﬁlm then introduces some es-

, sential Green Lanterns and“shdws how

Hal was “chosen by the ring” and trains
to be the new Lantern for his sector. As
to be expected, Hal is made fun of and
underestimated by the other Lanterns,
only to prove them wrong later by quickly
becoming a hero. Yawn.

Hector Hammond, Hal’s childhood
friend and villain-to-be, does present one
surprising aspect of the picture. Instead
of encountering the pure-evil villain we’d
expect, viewers actually feel pity for him.
Hector becomes “infected” with the evil
‘force of fear, Parallax, while examining
the dead body of the Lantern that gave
Hal the ring, who was mortally injured by
Parallax in space before he crash-landed
on Earth. I

Hector was a college professor spe-
cializing in alien life forms, a job that he
loved and fully believed in, and that was
his ultimate demise -— much like the way
the Green Goblin becomes evil in “Spider—

man.” In this way, “Green Lantern” is ask-
ing the age—old science ﬁction question,
“What is the effect of trusting science?”
— but in an unbelievably clumsy way.

With the negatives exposed, the “typi-
cal summer ﬁlm” aspects also make the
movie mindlessly entertaining. There’s
lots of explosions, the 3-D is well imple-
mented and Reynolds is funny,— like
always. And girls, as you well know, he’s
a beefcake, so there are plenty of-oppor-
tunities to ogle.

The plot stays faithful to the com-
ics— good for purists but bad for people
who crave a fresh look at the Green Lan-
tern. Reynolds is .a good Hal, who was a
self-conﬁdent test pilot in the comic and
is so inthe ﬁlm as well.

But that’s a role that pops up a lot in
comics. He could easily be Wally West/
The Flash. He’s already played Deadpool

‘and is slated to play him again. !I‘hey’re
all wise-cracking and self—involved su-
perheroes. So this character isn’t really a
stretch for him. ‘

_ “Green Lantern,” despite its down-
sides, ﬁts the mold of the action—' and

Ryan Reynolds plays the typical hunk of a

superhero — not that anyone minds.

FOOTBALL

Local product joins Panthers

Lauren Kirschman and Isaac Saul
Sports Editors

Pitt announced the addition of Ejuan Price‘ to
its 2011 recruiting class on Tuesday.

A highly touted linebacker out of'Wood-
land Hills in Allegheny County, Price recently
received a release from the letter of intent to
Ohio State that he signed in February.He’ll
have immediate eligibility to play for the
Panthers this season.

“Ejuan Price is an outstanding addition
to our freshman class,” Pitt head coach Todd
Graham said in a statement Tuesday. “He
comes from a tremendous football program
in Woodland Hills. Ejuan is an explosive play-
er who has great leadership abilities. He will
ﬁt in well with our defensive schemes and
philosophies.”

V Price played both tight end and linebacker
at Woodland Hills. Scout.com ranked him one
of the top 15 middle-linebacker prospects
in the country and the Pennsylvania Sports
Writers named him All-‘State Class AAAA.

The incoming freshman also helped lead
the Wolverines to two consecutive appear-
ances in the WPIAL Class AAAA champion-
ship game.

In a player evaluation on Scout.com, Bob
Lichtenfels wrote that Price is “a devastating
tackler who has a very quick ﬁrst step and

closes fast on the ball carrier.

“He sheds blocks and plays well in traf-
ﬁc,” Lichtenfels wrote. “Price moves well
laterally tracking down ball carriers sideline
to sideline.”

One of the-few potential‘ ﬂaws in Price’s
game is his smaller size: He measures in at 6
feet and 235 pounds. Pitt senior linebackers
Max Gruder and Greg Williams are 6—foot-

. 2, 230 pounds and 6—foot-3, 240 pounds,
respectively. _

Price could contribute right away this
season with the Panthers moving from a 4-3
defense to a 3-4 defense that will use more
pressure from linebackers on the quarter-
back.

During spring practice, there was heavy
competition at linebacker as the coaches
experimented with lineups.

Sophomore Dan Mason isstill recovering. it
from the knee injury he suffered last season, ‘

and redshirt freshman Todd Thomas also sat
out with an injury. - '

Gruder looks solid to keep his starting
position after leading the Panthers with
86 tackles last season. Fellow senior and
starter Greg Williams collected 64 tackles
last season. i V

Price joins the team with three other

Woodland Hills products, including defensive .
lineman Khaynin Mosley-Smith and defen- .

sive backs Lafayette Pitts and Jevonte Pitts.

CLUB spams

Pitt falls short at nationals

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

It’s a story most Pitt fans are all too familiar
with. -

‘A team gets the No. 1 seed, only to lose just
when it seems like its lofty goals might be within
reach. ‘

This was the case for the Panthers Ultimate
Frisbee team as it ﬁnished in atie forﬁfthplace at
the 2011 USAU DI College Open Championships
in Boulder, Colo., over Memorial Day weekend.
The team, which is a club program at Pitt, was
eliminated following a defeat in the quarterﬁnals
of the championship bracket at the hands of
Colorado University. ~ ‘

The Panthers area student—organized pro-
gram that competes in both the fall and spring

seasonsduring the school year. Run by player-

captains and a group of unpaid coaches, Pitt’s
players pay their way for the season.

The team also received allocations from
the Student Government Board to help with

V expenses.

After an impressive regular season, Pitt en-
tered the series, or college Ultimate’s version
of playoffs, as a favorite to make some noise.
Following tournament wins at Sectionals and
regionals, the team qualiﬁed for Nationals and
was awarded the No. 1 overall seed. It would
be their seventh straight appearance in college

~\.

Ultimate’s premier tournament.

“Being given the top seed, we were deﬁnitely
conﬁdent in our abilities to go on and potentially
win the whole thing, but it’s disappointing not
to accomplish whatyou feel is a reachable goal,”
assistant coach and Pitt alum David Vatz said.

The tournament didn’t start as the Panthers
would have hoped. In its ﬁrst match of round-
robin pool play, Pitt dropped a back-and—forth
encounterwith Iowa 14-12. '

However, the Panthers knew they couldn’t
get too upset about the loss, and they shifted
the focus to their remaining three pool games
in order to advance into the championship
bracket.

“After that loss, we knewwe had some tough
challenges ahead, but we wanted to remain
conﬁdent that we could win those next three
games,” Vatz said.

And the Panthers did just that. They swept
aside Illinois, Colorado College and Tufts by ﬁve
or more points in each game to ﬁnish pool play
witha3-1 record and earn aspotinthe 16-team
championship bracket.

In the round of 16 Pitt drew a game against

' British Columbia, and the Panthers continued

their winning ways by dominating the Cana-
dian team 15-7 and advancing tothe marquee
quarterﬁnal matchup against the No. 2 overall
seed and hometown team Colorado.

Smoking? The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh seeks
smokers aged 18-65
who are already plan-
ning to quit smoking to
participate in a 9-week
research study on the
short-term effects _of
two oral medications

‘craving, and mood.
One is FDA-approved
for smoking cessation,
Zyban (bupropion),
and'the other is FDA-
approved for wakeful-
ness, Provigil
(modaﬂnil). This is
not a treatment study.
You will be asked to
take study medication
that may or may not
contain the active com-
ponents. Research
study participants will
be compensated. Al-
though this study is not
a treatment trial, every-
one who completes the
study will be offered
optional brief counsel-
ing and Zyban (bupro-
pion) at no cost after
the study is over to
help them quit perma-
nently. For more infor-
