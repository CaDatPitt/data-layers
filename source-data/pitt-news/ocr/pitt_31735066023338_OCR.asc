A five member appeals panel will
hold an organizational’ meeting,
possibly within the next week, to
prepare for a hearing that will
review the recent decision to deny
tenure to Curtiss E. Porter, black
studies‘ professor.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg said
yesterday that the appeals panel

consists” of five faculty , members
chosen by lot. He said he could not
release the names of the panel.

Rosenberg’ said the panel was
formed after he received a request
for a hearing by Porter. Prior to
Porter’s request, Rosenberg said he
had sent Porter a written statement
that outlined the reasons for deny-
ing him tenure.

The panel’s task is to determine
whether the decision not to grant

'disi.nteresteidly might

tenure to Porter was one “that

reasonable men and women acting
have
reached,” according to the pro-
cedures listed in the FAS Gazette, a
publication of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. In addition, the panel
must attempt to find out whether
“inadequacies or improprieties”

existed when Porter’s‘ tenure case

was originally reviewed.

l”ResoIution Affirms SGB Support

For Black Studies Department I

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer
A resolution supporting the
original principles and framework
of the Black Studies Department
was passed by the Student Govern-
ment Board at yesterday’s meeting.
According to the resolution, the
Black Studies Department “was
originally conceived for the purpose
of better perceiving the special

needs and complexities of the black I

experience in America.”

The resolution was drawn up
because of the recent disagreement
between the administration and
black students about the future of
the Black Studies Department, ac-
cording to board member Martin
Bertocchi.

. “Students’ viewpoints can’t_ be
ignored in planning the future of a
department,” he said.

Bertocchi further stated that

Qcopies of the resolution are being

sent to administration officials. He
added that the ‘resolution might
help in getting students interested in
the issure, because “all student con-

cerns should be represented in plan-
ning departments.’.’

After the meeting, ‘Bertocchi said
the administration’s reaction to the
resolution will determine its affect.
The resolution was passed with one
abstention. I
' A student interested in black
studies commented at the meeting
that he felt the proposal wasn’t very
specific and didn’t support Curtiss
Porter, a black studies professor
who was recently denied tenure.

An emergency budget request
from the Engineering Student
Cabinet was also passed at the
meeting, although two board
members voted against it. The
engineers requested extra money to
lower the ticket price of their up-
coming formal, so that it could
compete with the ticket price of the
Greek formal.
pointed out by a student at the

meeting that the price of a Greek

formal ticket is approximately, the
same as that of an engineering
ticket. I ' “ 5  -

However, it was s,

  

that since there was “no
emergency” and that a ticket price
reduction was not needed, the $200
recommended by the allocations
committee should be rejected.

SGB President Bill Abraham
commented that the engineering
cabinet submitted a “poor
emergency request.” However,
Abraham said that since extra
money is now available to fund for-
mals, the board decided the money
should be distributed equally
among the Greeks, the engineering
cabinet, and the nursing student

organization.-, Abraham noted that »

the board had previously approved
a Greek Week request on merit.

tions Committee (PGR) represen-

Star Athletes Exploited,

Faculty Member Claims

By COLLEEN McDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Athletes are being improperly
used by the university, an
anonymous member of the faculty
told the University’s Faculty
Senate Committee on Athletics.

A certain athlete, said the facul-
ty member was ‘‘clearly being us-
ed by the university to the extent
that it was a moral, if not criminal
offense on the part of the universi-
ty.” ‘ '

The source insistedthat educa-
tion was not being emphasized for
“star sport” athletes attending Pitt.
It was also stated that the issue fac-

ed is a national one, not restricted

to Pitt alone. _
“A question must be posed,”
said the source, “if athletes are

pleted, the appeals panel has five
options, according to the Gazette.
It can either recommend that Dean
Rosenberg’s decision to deny tenure
to Porter will remain in effect, or it

can recommend various methods of A

review. These methods include-
reconsideration of the case by the
black "studies department, referring
the case to a review committee, or
‘directing the provost to either
reconsidelf Rosenberg’s decision or

making money for the university.

than why are they being con-
sidered last when it comes

“There has been no cor-

to so-called ‘using athletes’,” said
Dr. Edward Bozik, assistant

Coordinator Says Hotline Service Needs Student Backing

By WALTER R. WATSON
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pitt Hotline, located at 313

‘ Schenely Hall, is in need of the sup-

port of the university community. It
also seeks the help of students as
part of their staff, according to
Hotline coordinator Michele
Rzucidlo.

Most of the students involved
with the Hotline are interested in
what Rzucidlo termed “the caring
professions.” Some of the members
(there are eight active members) are
registered in the School of Social
Work or with the psychology
department, but the training pro-
gram is open to all interested Pitt
students, undergraduate or
graduate,” she said.

School '5
By HELEN GIANELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Most college graduates today
have many factors working against

them when they go to look for a

job. Choice of major, a highly
technical market and quality point
average all affect the chances of
finding a job.

,“As a matter of fact, we’ll be
holding a meeting at 6 p.m. tonight
in Room 204 of Schenley Hall.
Regular members will be there, but
there will be a full briefing on what
the Hotline, is all about for the
benefit of people interested in join-
ing the staf ,” she said.

There is a random survey being
done through the Campus Mail Ser-
vice which has been sent to the
dorms to determine whether or not
our service is needed and what is ex-

pected of, us if we are,” Rzucidlo

said.

In training new members,
students are required to attend lec-
tures from private psychiatrists,
psychologists and representatives of
volunteer organizations who are in-

vited or paid to speak at Pitt. There
is also role-playing which helps
students “get in touch with their
own feelings,” said Rzucidlo. With
the help of the Hotline’s graduate
advisor, Michael Gigler, the staff
learns and discusses the listening
techniques used in receiving
“client” calls on the Hotline.

The training session, which incor-
porates these activities, lasts about
six weeks. I.

“We basically. follow the
Rogerian method of listening when
answering the phones. We don’t
give advice, but we‘ encourage the
clients to talk out their problems. If
it seems that they need professional
counseling, we refer them to Pitt’s
Counseling Center,”said Rzucidlo.

Some of the speakers that have
been sponsored by the Hotline have
been affiliated with Action Against
Rape, the Pittsburgh Sexual
Minority Group, counselors from
the Pitt Counseling Center and
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic. ’

‘_‘It’s required that all trainees at-
tend the lectures, and every training
session,” said Rzucidlo.

What make the members of the
Hotline qualified to perform the
services they perform? Many
pessimistic students and other in-
dividuals have raised this question
in the past. In response to that ques-
tion Rzucidlo had this to say:

“When we’re operating at peak
performance, it will mean that all

staff members have a deep desire to 3

help others. That is the first step to’
having a qualified staff of caring in-
dividuals. It’s the most importaht.
if these people put in a mimimum of
seven hours a week, if they’re will-
ing to put that much time and
dedication to helping their fellow
students, then that desire and
dedication is really the backbone
and what will truly pay off in the
end.”

On Friday, the final part of this
series will appear which will
speculate on the future of the

Hotline, what are'some of the opi-3-,

nions of the former staff, and what ‘
is being done to make the Hotline a

more visible and needed student ser- ,

vice organization.

Name Now College Of General Studies

It is rare, however, that the name
of a school can hinder one’s
chances of landing a job.

The night students at Pitt were
finding this to be true, discovering
that the title of “the School of
General Studies” was acting as a
handicap in their job search. So,
they changed its name.

The dean of the school, Steele
Gow, says that employers did not
equate Pitt’s night school with a
regular accredited college.

“They associated the term
‘school’ with a trade, technical or
vocational institution,” he said.
“We felt the employers were being
misled and that is why we decided
to change our name.”

At the February board of trustees
meeting, the School of General
Studies officially became ‘the Col-
lege of General Studies. I

“We realized there was a prob-

An Exclusive Tanning 8 Fitness Salon ‘
For Men and Women

lem with the title a while back at our
annual 1uncheon,” Gow said.

Every year, the school hosts a
luncheon for local business and cor-
porate heads promoting night
students.

“Many businessmen were actual-
ly surprised to hear that the School
of General Studies, was at bac-
calaureate degree-granting unit,”
Gow said.

Pat Beck, CGS student agent,
said the hardest problem in chang-
ing the name was finding an ap-
propriate replacement.

“Twenty or thirty ideas were sug-

gested,” ‘she said, “but no one —

could seem to agree on any of
them.”

Gow said he suggested such
names as College of Academic and
Career Studies and University Col-
lege, but they were rejected.

“Finally we decided to draw-up a

referendum with the name Metro-
politan College and see if the
students and alumni liked the
name,” he said. “Unfortunately,
they did not.” ,

After a study of still more names
and of other universities’ _night
schools, officials of CGS decided to
merely change the_word school to
college.

“It was as simple as that,” said
Beck. I

According to Gow, there is no

fixed date to totally go with the

name change.

“It will be a gradual process,” he

said. “We will change the title on
things as the need arises. For exam-
ple, our summer time schedule will
bear the new name.”

It is hoped that with this gradual,

more subtle conversion, there will ‘
be little danger of CGS alumni los- '
ing the school identification.

“We felt we weren't fully a part _

of Pitt,” Gow commented. “Hope-
fully, we are done with the whole
issue and we achieved what we

‘ wanted to achieve.”

Searching for
The Very Best

In a recent interview with The Pitt News,.Profes.sor
John Chapman expressed concern about Improving
“the integrity” of the university in terms of faculty

' hiring and the related issue of tenure.

Chapman recommends that faculty openings, for
both tenured and non-tenured positions, should be
open to a national search process.

Chapman, by the way, is no rabble-rouser-—he‘ is a
respected political theorist/philosopher and is active-
ly involved in an organization called the Interna-
tional Council on the Future of the University. The

.council studies international trends in higher educa-

tion concerning tenure, hiring and related topics.

L  Therefore, his observations and concerns should

be taken seriously by the university administration.

The hiring of faculty is a very serious matter.
National searches to obtain the best faculty
members in the country, is a logical suggestion. A
rigorous search process, much like those that occur
for administrative openings, would enhance the
university’s prestige.
A high quality faculty results in a high quality in-

stitution. Universities like Stanford, Harvard and

Yale use a national search to fill their faculty posi-
tions. The result is obvious, consideringthe quality
of these institutions.

Besides prestige, -a high quality faculty, expert at
both scholarly research and teaching, would attract
more students to Pitt. Students would benefit by the
quality of the material taught to them in their
courses. - V

The tenure issue is much the same. There is a fear
in this country that academic departments are
becoming overly tenured. .

This problem closes the educational field from
young academics, trying to land jobs at institutions
of higher learning. The result is that young academics
with new ideas, are closed out of teaching positions.

Page 4—Wednesday, March 5, 1930 ‘ ‘

Again, look at the Ivy League and similar institu-
tions. Tenure positions are often open to national
searches in order to acquire the best faculty members
possible. In many academic departments at these
same institutions, tenured faculty represent from 50
to 70 percent of the staff.

At Pitt, most of the tenured faculty comes from

~ within the individual departments. The result of this

is that the number of tenured faculty increases and
the number of faculty openings decrease.
The job market for young academics becomes

‘ frozen and at the same time, the “old” faculty;

members continue teaching “old” material to new”
students.

An accompanying problem in the tenure process is
the possibility of politicalization. That is, tenure may
be awarded on the basis of friendship or connections
within the institution as avwhole or in the depart-
ment. A national, search would eliminate this factor.

The university would be wise to conduct national
searches for faculty and tenured positions. Not only
would it improve the integrity of the institution; it
would also help to aid student recruitment.

U.S. Gov't Should No Longer Intervene in Foreign Affairs

As “day 12l” passes, both the

.. American hostages in Iran«and the

American people wonder when the
hostages will be released. In letters
and interviews the hostages have
voiced their shock and disbelief that
the U.S. government did not place
their safety above that of the Shah.
Recently, the Iranian government
stated that the freedom of the
hostages depends on acknowledge-

- ment by the U.S. government of its
' role in Iran. The U.S. government

refused to do so, even though its ac-
tivity in Iran is well documented.
Carter continues to assure us that
he is doing all that he can to secure
the hostages’ release. To date,
twelve have been released, for

which Carter can claim none of the

credit. After four months of talk-

ing, why has the situation remained
unchanged?

From “day 1,” Carter has used
the hostage situation to his own ad-
vantage. In Order to justify U.S.
military moves and the possibility
of war, he has succeeded in
heightening the tension in the area.
The Carter Doctrine is just another
facade to protect the interests of
U.S. based multi-national corpora-
tions. For example, Exxon’s
recently released profit ﬁgures total
more than.$4 billion. Exxon ex-
plained that the profits were not ac-
quired domestically. Obviously,
such profits will in the future de-
pend on the American military
machine in the Persian Gulf. While
Carter keeps the hostages in limbo,
they and American sympathies for

reached, should be included.

The Pitt News reserves the right to edit all letters.

Letters in-

them will be used to protect the in-
terests of ,Exxon, Gulf and com-
pany.

The crisis has also transformed
Carter’s political demise. The focus
on his ineffective domestic policy
has been overshadowed by his
‘ ‘tough” stance in handling the ‘Iran
crisis (a stance which has yet to
prove itself effective.) Carter’s
main interest is not the hostages’
freedom. As long as they are held

captive, pro—war [activity can ac-‘
celerate and fuel Carter’s election"

‘campaign.’

If the hostages are to be released,
steps must be taken to end the
crisis, not to prolong it. Otherwise,
it will be the American people, not
the politicians and corporate heads,
who will be conscripted to fight a
war. The government’s historic
role in Iran, the establishment‘ and
maintenance of the Shah's op-
pressive regime, must be denounc-
ed. Iran, however, is not a unique
case. The U.S. continues to sup-
port fascist_ regimes all over the
globe. We must demand that our

government desist in its current pro- -

motion of such inhumane states.
We must also demand that there be
no future intervention of any form
by the U.S. government. These
steps would free the 50 Americans
in Iran and the millions of people
throughout the world being held
hostage by U.S. backed dictator-
ships.

The perenial theme of this refor-

American history. To him it has
always been a fascinating, challeng-
ing and glorious truth which should
be presented with more clarity and
emphasis. , K

A few quotations dealing with
our spiritual and patriotic heritage
will illustrate the writer’s belief.

In the Mayﬂower Compact we
read, “We have undertaken for the
Glory of God..”

John Harvard wrote these words

in his will: “Study to know God '-

and to lay God as the only founda-
tion of all knowledge and

A learning."

Our beautiful national motto is

taken from Psalms: “In God We‘

Trust.”

As President of the Constitu-
tional Convention Washington
said: “The event is in the hand of

_-God.”

Franklin reminded the conven-
tion -that they prayed daily during .
the Revolutionary War: “We had
prayers in this room for devine pro-
tection.”
“God governs in the , affairs of
men.”

Patrick Henry spoke these. words:
“There is a just God who presides
over the destinies of nations.” He
also said speaking of the "Bible, “It
is abook worth more than all other
booksever printed.”

This sentence by Jefferson has
been quoted often: “The Bible is
the cornerstone of Liberty.”

Andrew Jackson said: “The Bi- ‘

ble is the rock upon which our
Republic rests.”

Franklin continued, T‘



One of Lincoln’s biographers-§-.__
said: “Lincoln accepted.the Bible as 

the inspired Word of God.” His
religious mother said, “I ‘would
rather my son would be able to read
the Bible than to own a farm if he
can’t have butone.”

Let us remember_ the words of
President Grant: “Hold fast to the
Bible as the sheet anchor of your
liberties; write its precepts on your
heart and practice them in your
lives.” _ _

This list of impressive quotations
is short. A reader in our libraries
can gather an endless list.

It is the firm belief of the writer

that the unparalleled greatness of_‘._,

our marvelous republic rests on our 

spiritual and patriotic foundations.

An Appeal to America

To Side with Afghans

Afghanistan, an independent
country and member of the United
Nations, has been shamelessly in-
vaded by the Soviet Union because
17 million Afghans refused to yield
to a godless puppet Marxist govern-
ment. This arrogant use of brutal

“force and denial of every principle

of international law and justice
reveals the real aim of Soviet leaders
behind their untruthful declarations
about the world’s peace.

Since the bloody. coup of April
27, 1978, the communists have im-
prisoned and tortured 85-100,000
people and killed almost 30,000
political prisoners after taking their
blood for storage in blood banks of
Moscow. The Soviet Air Force
destroyed thousands of villages and
many towns, cities, mosques and
historical monuments in our coun-
try. Almost 250,000 people have
been killed by napalm bombs and
rockets while in excess of 1.5 milion
people lost their homes. On the
border areas of Pakistan and Iran
more than 600,000 homeless
Afghan refugees - mostly women
and children - live in the open air in

this cold winter. These. atrocities, ’

and the invasion of a peaceful na-
tion, have been reported to the
news media throughout the world.
But, contrary to our expectations,
the youth have not yet shown any
reaction. I

Do you think the Soviets have the
right to invade Afghanistan and im-
pose, by brutal force, their ideology
which is still maintained by -Police

States in their own country and H’

Eastern‘ Europe? Certainly’ no
sincere man can say yes to this ques-
tion.

_ For whatever reason you may
wish to keep silent we would like to
remind you that your peace and
happiness cannot last too long while
the Soviet Union arrogantly denies
law and order, ravages small na-
tions one after another and ad-
vances boldly toward world
domination. The society of nations
is not different in nature from na-
tional societies - it also needs
vigilant members to defend its laws
and “order. Today this historical

., mission falls, in the'first place, on
r .-
_ ‘ the youth of every country. They

should band together to create a

happy and peaceful world. We

to defend freedom, law and order at 6

the cost of any amount of tears and
blood needed to quench the thirst
of Soviet leaders. Thus, our strug-

, gle is your struggle.

We rely on the spirit that you
have inherited from your
forefathers and hope that you will
soon stand. on our side and con-

NITMatchup: A Fantas  

‘J

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Roarke and Tatoo stood on the
rocky path leading down to the
docks of Fantasy Island. “Hey
boss, ” said Tatoo, “what do those
‘men want?”
' The little man pointed a chubby
finger in the direction of two young
men stepping off the plane. The
taller was dressed in a gray, three-
piece suit and carried a clipboard.
The other, spectacled and wearing a
green velvet blazer, was clutching
what looked to be a rolled-up pro-
gram of some sort.

“Ah, Tatoo, ” replied Roarke.

smiling, “These men are college
basketball coaches and they want a
rematch between their teams. You
-see, although they played each
other twice this year and each team
won once, it looked as if only we
could do something about arrang-
ing just one more game between
them. ' —

now I must inform ‘them that they
have comeall this way for nothing
because in reality they will meet. I
can only hope they don ’t try to get a
refund from us.”

In a move that warmed the hearts
of die-hard Pitt and Duquesne
basketball fans, the NIT gave both
schools an extension on their

seasons by inviting them to play a.

first-round tournament game at the
Civic Arena tomorrow. Although
teams involved in conferences rare-
ly end on a happy note, both the
Panthers and Dukes were dismayed
by their season finales.

Pitt was abruptly dismissed from
the- Eastern Eight tournament by
league champ Villanova Friday
night, while Duquesne didn’t even
make it to the Arena. The team
from the Bluff met up with the boys
from the Hills of West Virginia and
for the second straight year missed
the semi-final round.

The teams have never played each
other three times in one season, Un-
til several years ago, their game was
a one shot affairs, usually taking
place during the Steel Bowl tourna-
ment in early December.

The Panthers and Dukes appear
closely matched, in paper and on
the court. Each team started out

the season well, then ran into trou-

ble. Duquesne owns a 17-9 record,
Pitt 17-11. In their first meeting
(Jan. 16 at the Field House), the
Panthers came out on top 55-53
when Duke» Rod Dixon’s last-
second jumpshot missed its mark.
Less than one month later (Feb. 10
at the Arena), the Panthers came up
short 67-66, this time with Panther
Carlton Neverson taking that one
last-second jumpshot and missing.

For Duquesne’s B.B. Flenory, it

appeared there would never again
be the cheers from the Arena crowd
and the taunts from Pitt supporters.
For Panther Sammie Ellis—who
fouled out early against Villanova
and Duquesne in the last
meetings——it was a frustrating end
to his -two-year collegiate career at
Pitt. The NIT has given both a
reprieve.

Without a doubt, this is one game
where more than tournament ad-
vancement is at stake, “Bragging
rights” is kind of a stupid phrase to

describe the intangible prize to be

won tomorrow. Pride and bragging
are not one and the same; perhaps
“prestige” is a better word. At any
rate, the winner gets to play at the
Arena against either Connecticut or
St. Pete’s who also meet tomorrow.
Pitt has already beaten Connecticut
this year in the latter schoo1’s
Christmas tournament.

Panthers Perform Admirably at EV\/L Championships

' By M_A'RK NITOWSKI
Pitt News Staff Writer *

Pitt assistant coach Chuck Cor-
yea predicted a few surprises from
the Panther grapplers this past
weekend and Glenn Maxwell, Bill
Clark, Mike Bond and Steve
Smocharski provided them as the
Panthers copped a second and three
third-place ﬁnishes in the Eastern
Wrestling League tournament at
Clarion State College. Bond grabb-
ed second place at 150 pounds,
while Maxwell, Clark and Smochar-
ski did things the hard way, battling
through the consolations to ﬁnish
third.

“Team-wise,” said Coryea, “I
think we did pretty well. The guys
that had a chance, did place.

“We lost most of our opening
matches, but our wrestlers came
back. Now we have to work on our
depth. Although we did well in
four of the weight classes, we really
didn’t have anything going in the

' other six,” he added.

2 Unfortunately, none of the Pan-
, thers’ third-place ﬁnishers were
'picked as wild-cards, which means
that Pitt’s Bond will be the only
Panther making the trip to Oregon
for the NCAA championships
March 13-15. The wrestlers, placing
' first and second at each weight class
.automatically advanced to the
NCAAS, while an assortment of
‘wild-card wrestlers were also tabbed
to move on to Oregon. The wild-
card winners had to ﬁght their way
through a loser’s or consolation

bracket. .
In Bond’s case, the Panther

' ‘ junior qualiﬁed in light of his se-

'cond place ﬁnish to Tony Caravella
at 150 pounds. Caravella, who was
seeded ﬁrst in the tournament,

defeated Bond in the ﬁnals by a
10-2 count.

However, before his defeat.
Bond bested Rob Albert of Clarion
(second seed) ' 8-5 and‘ W.V.U.’s
Jeff Rosenberger (third seed) 11-10.

Meanwhile, Caravella received a
ﬁrst round bye and then overcame
Cleveland State’s Rogan 11-7 to get
to Bond.

“Mike did a good job,” said
Coryea. “He beat the second seed
and the third seed and ﬁnally lost to
the first. In the ﬁnals I don’t think
Mike wrestled with as much intensi-
ty as he could have. The pressure
was more or less off of him. He was
relieved that he had qualiﬁed.”

Bond’s wasn’t the first surprise
of the tournament though. In fact,
it wasn’t even the second. At 118
pounds, Cleveland State
126-pounder Dan Foldesy surpris-
ingly dropped a weight class to take
on the likes of Mike DeAugustino,
Mike Nock, Jan Clark and Glenn
Maxwell. It was at 118 pounds that
Coach Coryea felt the talent was the
deepest.

“I think 118 had the most-

depth,” "explained Coryea. “They
had the best individuals, no real

superstars, just very good
wrestlers. ’ ’

Maybe catching the top
118-pounders off guard, the

unseeded Foldesy started off with a
win over Pitt’s Glenn - Maxwell
(fourth seed) 14-8, thenedged first
seed Jan Clark of Clarion 6-4 to get
to the ﬁnals.

Another unseeded grappler, Lock
Haven’s- Mike Millward, swept

through the opposite bracket to‘

match-up with Foldesy i_n the 1_18
ﬁnal. However, Foldesy blaste’d

Millward 9-3 to grab the title.

Thrown into the consolation
bracket, Maxwell scratched his way
past Bloomsburg’s Mike Nock (se-
cond seed) by default, then topped
Clark 6-3 to place third.

With the dropping out of
Foldesy, the race was somewhat
scrambled at 126 pounds. Top seed
Steve Jastrabeck of Clarion, cleanly
cut his path to the finals with two
falls. First he pinned W.V.U.’s
Dave Taylor with 11 seconds left in
the ﬁrst period, then slammed Penn
State’s Steve Bass to the mat with
1:10 remaining in the second period
of their semi-finals match.

Bass had already defeated Pitt’s
Bill Clark in the opening round by
an 11-10 score.

However, Jastrabeck was injured’

in the 126 pound ﬁnal, and
defaulted to Bloofnsburg’s Don

Reese. Reese, seeded second, made -

it to the championship match by
topping George DeAugustino of
Lock Haven 6-0.

Following up on Maxwell, Pan-
ther Clark battled his way through
the consolations, defeating Taylor
16-6, DeAugustino 9-2, and
Cleveland State’s Palivoda 8-2, to
place third.

vClarion’s Randy Miller ﬁnished
atop the 134 pound class, winning
by default over Penn State’s Bob
Bury.

To get there, Miller pinned Pan-
ther Glenn Nacion and defeated
Bloomsburg’s Ed Fiorvanti 11-3.

In the consolations, Fiorvanti
beat all-America Mark Cagle of
West Virginia 7-2 and was picked as

NCAAs. However, Cagle was also

"At 142 pounds, Bill Walsh of
Cleveland State pinned Pitt’s Jeff
Gordon with 22 seconds left in the
second period of their first round
launched himself
towards the 142 pound crown, later
attained by defeating Bernie Fritz
of Penn State 16-4. .

Gordon was also beaten by Lock
Haven’s Ken Parsely 9-3 during the
consolation matches. '

Another Clarion Golden Eagle

earned a berth to the NCAA’s with
a win at 158 pounds. Dale Gilbert
nipped Penn State’s Geoff
Brodhead 6-3 in the finals. The Big
Bloom’s Bucky McCollum was also
nominated to the Oregon tourna-
ment with an 8-5 victory over Lock
Haven’s Doug Gallaher in the con-
solations.

Panther Eric Harris absorbed a
pair of defeats at 158 pounds, los-
ing by fall to McCollum, then drop-
ping a decision to Gallaher 15-7.

Things went as scheduled in the
167 pound weight class as Blooms-
burg’s ‘Dom DiGioacchio toppled
Ron Varga of Cleveland State by
an 8-4 tally. A ’

Panther John Chendy lost in
furst round action to Penn State’s
John Hanrahan 17-7. Hanrahan
utilized the win over Chendy as a
stepping stone to’ a third place
ﬁnish and a trip tothe NCAAs.

Coach Coryea turned up smell-
ing like a rose in another predic-
tion as a healthy Charlie Heller of

' \

Clarion destroyed Bloomsburg’s
Butch Snyder -10-1 to take the 177
pound title. Heller paved his way
to the title with a 5-1 advancement
over Andy Bingaman of Penn State
and the second period pin of Lock
Haven’s Lynn Stover.

Heller,

Before meeting

Bingaman had previously shut-out

Pitt’s Jeff Wilps 8-0. A pier six
brawl materialized at 190 pounds
where Mark Downing of‘Clarion
squared off against Penn State’s
Danny Pfautz. Downing chalked
up the 190 pound crown, slipping
by Pfautz 10-7.

To make it to the finals Downing
defeated Pitt’s Pat Connor 14-1
and Cleveland State’s ’ Pete San-
drev 8-4, while Pfautz topped Lock
Haven’s Pat Bownen 13-2 and
W.V.U.’s tough Jeff Roscoe 14-1.

At heavyweight, Jack Campbell
gave Clarion their sixth represen-
tative at the NCAA championships
by defeating Cleveland State’s
Tim Payne 6-3. Pitt’s Steve
Smocharski was blanked by‘Payne

_5-0 in the semi-ﬁnals‘, but he later

made a go of things as he blitzed

through the consolations to a_

‘third-place finish. _

-After losing to Payhe, Smochar-
ski likewise blanked) Lock Haven’s
Tim Thompson 6-0, then beat Penn
State’s Scott Loncor 10-4.

However, it was not enough as

Smocharski, along with Maxwell
and Clark, wereleft out in the cold
of Pittsburgh. Only Bond will hit
