Florence may
possess origins

of Christian
Worship .

Staff Wrz'ter

Christianity may be getting a historical
makeover. Having studied the Basilica

di Santa Maria del Fiore, an ancient ca-I

thedral in Florence, Italy, for 40 years,
Franklin Toker collected ample amounts
of evidence supporting his claim that the
cathedral served as the Very beginnings
of Christianity in the city.

Toker, a professor in Pitt’s history of
art and architecture, presented his find-
ings on Wednesday at noon to a group
of about 100 people in the auditorium
‘of the Frick Fine Arts Building.‘These
findings will be published in the third
and fourth volumes of his book series,
“The Florence Duomo Project,” in 2014
and 2016, respectively. ‘

Toker said that there were three func-
tions of his lecture. The ﬁrst was to pro-
vide a preview of his spring seminar for
students. The second was to highlight
his two books that he published in 2009
and 2012. The third was to share his
newest ﬁndings. ‘

More than 200 students were evacuated

' from two Pitt dormitories for about three
hours Wednesday night after a suspicious
package was reported at a nearby store.
According to Pitt Police Chief Tim
Delaney, an employee at the‘UPS store
at 3945 Forbes Ave. dialed 911 at 6:40
p.m. to_alert the Pitt and city police de-

. partments about a suspicious package

that had been dropped off in the-store.
Police located a CMU student who had

been trying to send the package as part

of a larger shipment to California. After
speaking with the student and examining
the package, police determined that none
of. its contents were dangerous.
Delaney said that he cleared Bruce
and Brackenridge halls after receiving
the call as a precaution because of the
two dormitories’ proximity to the store.

meeting place,” he said.
Toker explained that because Rome

had the religious power in Italy, Flor— ~

ence was not the center of Renaissance
Italy. While dozens of cities around the
country boasted of such Roman struc-
tures that had withstood many ages,
Florence had no such claim.

“Nobody’s disputing that Florence
had Roman beginnings, but Florence
had nothing to show for them,” Toker
said. . -

If any currently standing structure in
Florence could be attributed to Rome, it
would be the baptistery of the Basilica
di Santa Maria del Fiore, Toker said.

The.Basilica has been excavated four
times in the last century. Since then,
archeologists have found remains of

an elaborate Roman house at the site.

Past scholars claimed that the build-
ing housed a baptismal pool, but Toker
disagreed with this interpretation.

“It was immensely too large and ign-
possibly large and deep,” he said. “My
verdict was that more Christians would
have drowned than would have acquired
eternal life.”

Rather than labeling the ruins as a
baptismal pool, Toker said that it more
accurately resembled a small baptis-
tery, or a hall connected to the church
where baptisms occurred.

Toker questioned why previous
scholars had not proposed at the home
being a site for Christian worship, oth-
erwise knownas a housechurch.

Toker explained that Italians in Flor-
ence were forced to practice Christian-
ity in secret in the second and third
centuries, as the religion was not yet
accepted by the emperor. .

According to Toker, the baptistery
appears to have been constructed in the
courtyard of the ‘house. Toker said that
this would have made the pool appear
decorative and could have easily fooled
police. Additionally, it would be an easy
place to dispose of water.

Toker theorized that the transforma-
tion of the home into a place for Chris-
tian worship likely occurred during the
third ‘century, when first reports of

. early Christian life in Florence surfaced.

The house church likely functioned
as such until the emperor ofﬁcially tol-
erated Christianity and actual churches
were constructed around the city.

Shirin Fozi, an assistant professor
in Pitt’s history of art and architecture
department, said that Toker’s ﬁndings
served as a great example of how we
can look back at archeological excava-
tions and see things nobody had noticed
before.

“Each generation brings fresh schol-
arship and new insights to the table,”
she said. “We know so much more about
early Christian culture than we did 100
years ago, and we’re lucky to have Pro-
fessor Toker bringing that knowledge to
Florence, and to one of the most signiﬁ-

, cant cathedrals in European history.”

Morgan’Austi.n, a freshman engi-
neering major, agreed that Toker’s in-
sights were remarkable.

. “It was interesting that he discov-
ered the baptistery just from the idea
ofa pool,” she said. I

PACKAGE

17 students were evacuated from Bruce
Hall —— it houses few residents this year
due to an ongoing renovation process to
the building — andabout 200 students
were evacuated from Brackenridge Hall.

Because Pitt and city police could not
immediately identify the nature of the
contents of the package, which included
papers, a powder substance and wires,
the bomb squad and city Hazardous Ma-
terials Unit were called. Delaney said that
the FBI was_ also called to the scene be-
cause the package was being mailed out

“l\/Ianey ofus

weren’t sure

if it was real _
or not. ”

Matthew Jones

of the state.

The police located the student mailing
the package and brought him back to the
scene, where he explained the contents
of the box to the bomb squad and FBI.
The student’s name was not released be-
cause “he did not do anything wrong,”
according to Pittsburgh Police Zone 6
Commander Scott Schubert.

“There was nothing of concern,”
Schubert said.

Forbes Avenue was closed from
Bouquet Street to Bigelow Boulevard.
Schubert said the distance cleared around
a threat, along with evacuation and shel-
ter-in-place procedures, is determined by
the bomb squad’s analysis of the location
of a particular threat.

Police redirected students around the
scene, and the ENS alert directed evacu-
ated students to the William Pitt Union.

Matthewjones, a sophomore living in
Brackenridge Hall, evacuated the build-
ing when the ﬁre alarms sounded. He said
that since there were ﬁre drills earlier

in the week, many of his friends took
their time exiting the building until they
received ENS phone-call alerts.

“Many of us weren’t sure if it was real
or not, so I took my time getting ready
because I didn’t see any officials around,”
he said.

Andrea Groves, also a sophomore
living in Brackenridge Hall, found out
about the suspicious package through a
friend’s emergency notiﬁcation. She is
not signed up for the service.

Groves expressed frustration with the

lack of information given to students and
said that students need more communi-
cation from the University in situations
that ENS alerts are used.

“Even though they notify us, they
don’t keep us updated on what they are
finding out,” she said. “They should send
messages to people’s Pitt email, because
they know we all have them.”

‘Service said people on the scene were
focused on “trying to get the situation
resolved” and therefore did not have
the time. to provide additional updates

to students through the Emergency No-
tification System. I

COLUMN

Ending the intellectual turf war.

Simon Brown
Columnist

A brutal competition is gripping

higher education across the na-

tion. While it can be exciting to
watch unfold, it is still mired in
bureaucratic mismanagement.
Ultimately, it can consume the

attention of university students

and administrators, and spur
them to seriously detrimental
decisions.

And no, I’m not talking
about college football.

Rather, it is the competitive
relationship that exists within

many scholarly communities‘

that equally fulﬁlls these de-
scriptions. This competition

across the intellectual gridiron,
however, serves only to rein-
force the needless walls divid-
ing academic departments. And
ultimately, it misleads students
and the public to adopt shallow
attitudes toward the value of
scholarly research. '

It is not only in scholarly cir-
cles, however, that this attitude
thrives. It would take an oblivi-
ous reader to open a magazine
or national newspaper and miss
the many articles describing
how neuroscience antiquates
psychology, or the editorials
musing on the “relevance” of
the humanities. _

In all of the voluminous lit-
erature treating these topics,

one common theme persists:
Society, technology and the
economy are ‘changing, and
scholarly research should or
should not change with it.
This underlying theme
equates technological and
scientific advance with a nec-
essary advance into more rel-
evant scholarly pursuits. In this
depiction, the old—fashioned
scholars — usually, those in
the humanities and social sci-
ences — try to understand their

subjects with the methods and '

instruments of a bygone era.
But now that the situation

has ‘changed, and with it the

horizon of intellectual possibil-

ity, these authors suggest that schol-
ars in such ﬁelds ﬁnd their appropriate
place in the museum, rather than the
classroom. V
Why, they have asked, would anyone
waste time speculating from-an arm-
chair about the connection between
mindland brain when fMRIs can vi-
sualize them in real time? Why would
anyone-consult a psychologist about a
child’s mental development when we
could simplyicovnsult the child’s genes?
The’§e;cl'airnsj, however, prove noth-
ing‘mo—r’e. thanfgross simplifications.
fbittered with buzzwords such as “in-
novation,” “outdated” and “21st centu-
ry,” the contributors to this theme seem
to think that intellectual communities
follow the same linear progression as

the. succession of iPod models. No one
wants to hang out with the lame psychol-
. ogists and philosophers, still dawdling
with their iPod minis, while thevpopular
.‘neuroscientists and biophysicists show

off their iPhone 5s.

But somehow, despite this character-
ization, students continue to study “old—
fashioned” ﬁelds and scholars continue
to do research within their bounds.

The reason for this difference lies
in the inherently pluralistic nature of
academic work. No one ﬁeld can out-

_ mode another, so long as both pursue
their subjects with different methods
' and ﬁnd different conclusions. .

Academic work is less a turf war in
which different scholars ﬁght to pre-
serve control of their own tract of sub-
ject matter and more an open conver-
sation in whichischolars can study, the
same subject and find different aspects
interesting. i ' ” . _ - ‘ ' i ,

Take, for instance, someone reading

a book by Jane Austen.‘-Originally con- --

sidered in the domain of a literary schol-
ar,"neuroscientists and English scholars

have now begun working together to

study the recognizable patterns in brain
behavior when individuals read works
by the Victo_rian—era novelist-

Does this mean that English litera-

ture classes will now be taught by neu-

roscientists? That literary scholars will
exchange their tweed jackets for lab
coats en masse? V T

Despite the alarms of nervous hu-
manists and ambitious scientists, this
need never be the case — and for good
reason. .

Literary scholars and neuroscientists
may be able to study the same thing,
but that doesn’t mean they have to be
interested in the same things. While
a neuroscientist may reach fascinat-
ing conclusions about changes in brain
chemistry in a reader’s head, a liter-
ary, critic would care more about the
changes in the English novel as a genre.
While ‘the neuroscientist is interested
in"what’s goingon in the head of any

given reader, the literary scholar might

be interested in what’s going on in the
head of Jane Austen.

, And-until scientists make a serious
breakthrough in neuro-necromancy,
thatprobably won’t be possible with
an MRI.

Understanding that intellectuals or-
ganize in communities not to “under—
stand” a particular subject, but rather

to search for particularanswers to ques-
tions that they uniquely ﬁnd interesting,
can help scholars and administrators
better understand what it really means
to be interdisciplinary.

Along with “massive open online
courses” and “experiential learning,”
the term “interdisciplinary” has become
a favorite in the rhetoric of university
spokespeople. Though it is certainly

noble for universities and agencies to

fund research projects that supposedly
break down academic walls, rarely is
this a frequent occurrence. Rather, the
fundamental misunderstanding that as-
sociates scholarship with one particular
subject can mislead universities and

‘foundations to consider interdisciplin-

ary anything that places scholars as-
sociated with one subject on the ‘turf’
of another.

A more sophisticated and less ad-
versarial notion of interdisciplinarity
will require several unique perspectives
with diverse interests working together
to deﬁne.

What a novel concept. I

In ‘Rush,’ Chris Hemsworth plays the hardsliving, but gdeeplyirouhled, Formula Dneiracer James Hunt. MCT Campus

FILM REVIEW

‘Rush’ a thrilling, surprisingly complex,’ character study  

‘Rush’

Starring: Chris‘
Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhi,
Olivia Wilde
Directed by: Ron Howard
‘Grade: A

Brett Murphy
Staﬁ’ W riter.

Over the thunder of a Formula One
engine, running his hand across the
pristine steel, a character proclaims,
‘_‘Men like women, but they love cars.”
“Rush,” with a good deal "of unapolo-
getic chauvinism, makes an argument
that they love both. But director Ron
Howard transcends the dude-flick trope
with a compelling cross-character ex-
amination and panoramic look at 19705
Formula One racing.

James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is
an up-and—coming race car driver who
embodies the heart—pounding nature of
the sport. ‘I-Ie scorches around bends

and corners, barreling into gaps that
scare other drivers, whizzing to the
checkered flag.

Off the track, he behaves with similar

abandon. He parties too much, swears.

too much and drinks too much — but
not nearly enough to dull his insatiable
thirst for the myriad of women who are
in and out his bed faster than a Ferrari
down the stretch. But if you look past
his grocery list of indiscretions and
foibles, he’s really just a kid —— impish,
overexcited and ruthlessly addicted to
adrenaline. -
Hemsworth, with roped blond hair
tucked under his helmet and a face that
bounces between steely reserve and
warmth, bears striking resemblance

— .

to the actual British playboy whom he

portrays. Aggressive_in every sense of '

the word, Hunt is the likable badass
who lives hard, drives harder and, natu-
rally, has commitment issues.

His wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde), can
only remain by his side for so long be-
fore his ferocity on the track makes its
way to the home front. Hunt harbors
an unhealthy obsession with racing,
and when he’s out of the driver’s seat

.— or worse, losing ——his actions of-

ten becomedestructive. When’ he’s not
partying or driving, he’s a decidedly
lonesome guy, which might be the only
personality type ﬁtlfor this occupation.

STAND-UP COMEDY

September T9, 2018 l The Pitt News‘! v\A/Wv.pittnevve.com

Bill Burr ignores critics,
J focuses on comedy

John Lavanga
A€9°E Edzifor

Bill Burr at Hejnz Hall
6OO Penn Ave.,
Downtown ..
Friday, Sept. 20

8 pm.

As a comedian, actor and radio personal-
ity, Bill Burr has developed a following for
his blunt, everyman style of humor. Burr
never holds back, going on riffs about his
issues with women, American education,
The Oprah Winfrey Show and the tribula-
tions of dog ownership.

In anticipation of his performance -at

Heinz Hall on Friday, he spoke to The Z

Pitt News about his role on Breaking Bad,
the key to comedic actingand why he’s
never going to worry about offending his
audience.

The Pitt News: Some of your comedy
can be fairly edgy. Do you ever worry

. about offending the audience? ' _
Bill Burr: People are smart. They re— ,

alize that they’re at a comedy show and
that somebody’s up there telling jokes,

- and jokes are not meant to be taken seri-

ously. You can decide as an individual that
you want to take certain jokes seriously
and other jokes are just jokes to you. But

that’s not on the comedian, that’sAon the

person listening.

TPN: But in the age of blogs and Twit-
ter, there’s always the worry that you may
offend a larger-group. Has that made you
more sensitive? ,

Burr: What are they gonna do to me? I
don’t have a television show, so you can’t
threaten to take my TV show away. I tell
jokes in strip malls. There’s nothing you
can do to me.

There’s two kinds of being offended.
There’s an individual thing and then you
have an agenda and you have a cause.
People who have an agenda and a cause,
it’s a waste of time to get offended at
somebody when they can’t attach it to
anything.

You have to have a TV show or some-

. thing that brings advertisers so theycan

threaten those, and then that causes mo-
mentum and then local news or whatever

. picks up on it because it’s an easy story .

 At the end of the day, it’s a pony and
dog show.

TPN: How did you get involved with
Breaking Bad? -

Burr: I was a big fan of it and I kept
bugging my agent, and that got the ball
rolling. Vince [Gilligan], for some reason,
thank God,decided to take a chance on
me and it worked out. Because he did  I
seem to get as much dramatic work as I do
comedy-.7 Which is great, because, ya know,
the oldvariety being the spice of life.

’ TPN: Do yousee any difference be-
tween comedic acting and dramatic act-
ing?

Burr: I don’t see any difference. Your
character believes whatever they’re say-
ing, whether it’s drama or comedy. If it’s
comedy, the situation, the words and all
of that are written. The laughs will handle
themselves. All you have to do is believe
what you’re saying. '

Look, you ever see a fender bender‘?
Two people get into a car accident and
then they start yelling at each other? To
those two people, that situation is not
funny. But you’re sitting there watching it
and it’s f *cking hilarious  Your car isn’t
damaged. You don’t have to call the insur-
ance company. You don’t have to go to
court. You don’t have to worry about pos-
sibly getting sued. But all those thoughts
are in those two 'people’s heads. So their
emotions are heightened and they.’re
screaming at each other because they
both think they’re right. You don’t have
to be wacky, you just have to try to win.

Suzy tells her estranged husband, “I

Between 2oO9’s Middle Cyclone and
her latest full—length album, The Worse
Things Get, -The Harder 1 Fight, The
Harder I Fight, The More I Love You,
Neko Case sunk into a crippling'depres—
sion. After losing her grandmother and
both parents in a short period of time,
Case reached a distant and challenging

‘creative period. She claims to hardly

even remember writing many of the
songs written during this time. _
These songs eventually became her
excellent sixth studio album. Daring as
ever, Case continues to brazenly carve

up gender expectations with her trade-

but she also turns in the most introspec-

most‘ reflective lyrics. But the music
itself does little tocreate a moody or
brooding experience. _

Far removed from her ‘days as a
country—western artist, Case all but
abandons the twang for a convincing
blend of power-pop, folk-rock and
mid-tempo ballads. Most songs on The
Worse Things Get sound as mainstream
and familiar as anything Case has re-
leased to this point, but they are deliv-
ered with a booming conviction and a
cutting wit that are unmistakably hers.

In a recent interview with The
Guardian, Case vwasgespeciallyvocal
about her problems with theiccurrent
feminist movement’s focus:'“D.on’t stop
here and ﬁghtlaabo/ut why7you’re' call-
ing yourselfa feminist or not. Because
the women who marched and fought so
we could vote, they didn’t do it so we
could sit around bickering about what
we called ourselves.” _ 

Case mirrors, that sentiment on
the album with declarations like “I’m
a man’s man,.I’ve always been  You

‘ deal with me directly,” from the new

album’s lead single, “Man.” Powered
by a throttling lead guitar line from M.
Ward, it stands out among Case’s most
aggressive statements to date. .

Instead of simply pining to be “one
of the boys,” she wants to show the boys
how to be men — even if it means kick-
ing their asses in the process. On the
track following “Man,” the acoustic “I’m
From Nowhere,” she tactfully grapples
with her previous bold assertion, sing-
ing “I was surprised when you called
me a lady, ’cause I’m still not sure that’s
what I wanna be.”

When she’s not crusading against

gender norms, Case turns inward for

compelling commentary on heartbreak,
dep'ression and getting a handle on life
itself. On early album highlight “Night

Still Comes” Case pleads again and

again, “You never held it at the right
angle.” .The “it” is seemingly irrelevant
— she just seems desperate for a tighter
grasp on things. Some songs are down-
right_romantic, but Case manages to
transcend sappy sentiment. “Calling
Cards” and “Local Girl” commiserate
the toll that years of heartbreak and
distancecan take while shamelessly
longing for the one that got away.

The Worse Things Get is at its most

V conceptually daring when Case recalls

an exchange she witnessed between a
mother and her daughter in a Hawaii
airport. Performed entirely a cappella
and lathered in reverb, Case transcribes
the mother’s scathing dialogue directly:
“Get the f *ck away from me, why don’t
you ever shut up?” Given Case’s tenu-
ous relationship with her mother, this
scene resonated strongly with her. It’s
the album’s most chilling moment,
and it strives to replicate the impact
the mother’s words would have on her
child’s life.

Most impressively, none of the the-
matic risks or conceptually challenging
material ever weighs down songcraft
on The Worse Things Get. Despite go-
ing through a rough patch, Case didn’t
soften her approach. Instead, she con-
ﬁdently tightened it. With her stirring
conviction, one might believe that she
could make it through anything". I

SPORTS

WOMEN'S SOCCER
Team set to

face tough
Clemson  

squad

Andrew Stern
Stcyff Wrz'ter

The Pitt women’s soccer team is scheduled to
face off against the Clemson Tigers tonight
at Riggs Field in the ﬁrst ACC road game for
the Panthers — just their second trip outside
of Pittsburgh this season.

The match will also mark the ﬁrst time the
two schools have ever faced off in women’s
soccer. .

Pitt’s season thus far

Pitt enters tonight’s contest with an over-
all record of '4-3-1 and an ACC record of (5-2.
So far this season, the Panthers have defeat-
ed Duquesne (1-0), Bucknell (3-0), Central
Michigan (1-0) and Toledo (1-0). The lone tie
of the season came against cross-town rival
Robert Morris on the road.

The Panthers fell to Boston College, Ohio
State and North Carolina fortheir three loss-
es. In those three games, opponents out-
scored the Panthers 6-0.

Pitt goalie Nicole D’Agostino has been
solid this season for the Panthers. The ju-
nior goalkeeper has recorded four shutouts
so far this year and allowed just six goals in
seven games.

The Panthersare led on offense by Roosa
Arvas, who has tallied a pair of goals and two
assists this season. ‘ ' '  -

I Clemson thus far

The Clemson Tigers come into the match- ~

up with an overall record of 3-2-2. In confer-
ence play, the Tigersare 1-1, thanks in large
part to last weekend’s 2-1 victory over the
Boston College Eagles.

In its other conference game this season,

Clemson fell to Maryland 2-1 in overtime. The V

Tigers have played extremely well against
top opponents: The team tied Auburn and

VOLLEYBALL . ~ .

Anticipation bs fo e trnament

Caitlin Hinsey
Staff Wrz'ter

The Pitt women’s volleyball team will

play its first ofﬁcial home matches this .

weekend as the Panthers host the Pitt
Panther Invitational. The Panthers (7-3)

_welcome Cornell, Rutgers and More-

head State to the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

Pitt plays its ﬁrst match of the invi-
tational Friday morning against Cornell
(2-4). Later, Pitt takes on Rutgers (3-8)
in the last match of the day.

Pitt plays its third and ﬁnal match on
Saturday against Morehead State (6-4).

The Panthers arelooking to get their
ﬁrst win on their home court. The Pan-
thers have yet to play an official game
in the’Fitzgerald Field House, as their
only home match so far this season was
an exhibition game against Dabrowa, a
professional Polish team.

“We are all really excitedto be at
home,” junior setter Lindsey Zitzke
said. “We get all of our friends and fam-
ily there to come support us, so it’ll_be
really good for us. Another big step.”

BASKETBALL

Pitt to holdﬁrst-ever ‘Morning Madness’   .

Patrick McAteer
Edz'tor-z'1_z—C/zzkf p"

This year, celebration of the Pitt basket-
ball team’s season will begin not at mid-
night — as is commonly done at other
universities .' but in_the morning.

The Pitt_Athletic Department an-
nounced that Pitt’s basketball—season-
opening fanfest, known commonly in the
college-sports community as Midnight
Madness, will occur instead at 10:30 a.m.

on Sept. 28 at Stage AE, prior to the home- '

coming football game against Virginia.
The athletic department has named the

event “Morning Madness,” and it will take _

part in the department’slSuper Saturday
homecoming events schedule.
Chris Ferris, the associate athletic di-

rector for eicternal relations, said Morn- ‘
ing Madness is a logical follow up to last a

year’s outdoor Madness Event.‘ ,
“It’s really all about'trying to be cre-

ative and fun and to do something dif-

ferent,” he said. ,

Despite the early start time for the
event, Ferris says he’s conﬁdent that it
will draw a crowd comparable to last
year’s season—opening event. He cred-
ited the Panther Pitt, the football team’s

student section, and the Oakland Zoo,

V the basketball team’s student section. C

Last year, the team commemorated
the 'University’s 225th anniversary with
a Midnight Madness event on Bigelow
Boulevard‘ during homecoming week-

‘ end. Itwas Pitt’s ﬁrst time celebrating the

NCAA—mandated ﬁrst day on which col-
lege basketball teams can begin practice.

Admission to the event is free to the
public and gates will open at‘9:30 a.m.

— The’ event will feature player introduc-

tions, promotional activities and a slam-
dunk contest leading up to the football
game at 12:30 p.m. I

. Pitt has had a week offsince it played
at the USF Invitational, at which the
team went 2-1. The Panthers’ only loss
came against No. 22 Purdue.

The Panthers’ first opponent of their
tournament, Cornell, is looking to bring
its record to within one game of .500.
Ofithe four teams participating in the
Pitt Panther Invitational, Cornell is the
team with the least amount of experi-
ence in the 2013 season.

Though it has a losing record, Cor- '

nell has been‘ a competitive'team in

every match. Cornell’s biggest point _

difference in a loss —~ 11 points —— was
in the Big Red’s ﬁrst match of the sea-
son versus Buffalo. Since then, they’ve
seemed to ﬁnd a way to be successful
on the court. '

This success can be attributed to the
emerging leaders on the team. Senior
outside hitter Kelly Marble and sopho-
more right-side hitter Breanna Wong

are first and second, respectively, on S

the team leaderboard in kills. Marble
has 76 kills in six matches and Wong
has recorded 74.

Freshman setter and right—side hit-
ter Alyssa Phelps is also making anim-
pact for Cornell. The young player is the
starting setter and has been living up to
the responsibilities of her job. Phelps
has tallied 217 assists in six starts.

Pitt’s second opponent is a familiar
team. Pitt and Rutgers were former rival
members of the now-defunct Big East
Conference.

Pitt’s last matchup against Rutgers

  

135 9th Street as “Downtown Pittsburgh
WWW.Il|llS|I8X0liC.C0lll  412-231-7703

occurred last season. The match went
to ﬁve sets, with the Panthers winning
the decisive ﬁfth set 15-11.

This match could be a repeat of last

‘season’s, as both teams still possess

the majority of last year’s teams. For
the young Rutgers squad, there isn’t a
player more important than sophomore
outside hitter Alex Lassa. A

Lassa is a key player for Rutgers both
offensively and defensively. Lassa has
tallied 169 kills this season —, double
the amount of the next-closest Rutgers
player — and leads the team in points
scored. Defensively, Lassa is second in
digs with 122. _

The Panthers’ ﬁnal opponent, More-
head State, a member of the Ohio Valley
Conference, is another strong oppo-
nent. Morehead State is currently on a
two-game winning streak and looks to
remain above the .500 level.

Morehead State’s top player is sopho-
more outside hitter Courtney Smith.
Smith is one of the top players in the
kills category, having 91 so far. Smith
also leads Morehead State with 15 ser-
vice aces.

. Pitt will look to defeat its three op-
ponents this week by relying on its key
players. 5

Offensively, the Panthers will rely on
junior opposite Kate Yeazel and junior
outside hitter Jessica Wynn to lead the
team in kills at the net. Defensively,
Pitt will look for junior libero Delaney
Clesen to continue her outstanding sea-
son, hopefully adding more digs to her
already team-leading total of 159.

‘ ‘‘We’re just going to take it game by
game, and hopefully make baby steps
and continue to do well,” Zitzke said.
