Hovde Discusses
Chief Principles
Of Progressivism

Inquiry Speaker Thinks Doctrines
Of Progressives In Sympathy
With American Character

By James Donoghue

“A progressive is one who doesn’t
plan revolutions but just accepts them
as they come.

Thus, Dr. B. J. Hovde, professor of
history, in a sentence practically de-
ﬁned the theory and the practice that
lie behind the progressive movement
in present-day American society. H.e
spoke at the third meeting of Inquiry
Club, VVednesday, on “Principles of
Progressivism.”

“Progressivism deals with problems
realistically and as they happen. Con-
sefvatives say that movements in so-
ciety must be ‘natural.’ Progressives

realize this but decline to hold to hard .

and fast doctrines, realizing that vital
institutions change with changing
viewpoints. Institutions to them are
but a means and not an end. Unlike
socialists and communists, progress-
ives talk the ‘American language’ and
conﬁne themselves to tactics which
the masses understand.”

In the early moments of his talk Dr.
Hovde sketched the background of
progressivism in American history up
to the inception of the Wisconsin
movement under the La Follettes. Ac-
cording to him, progressivism is “in-
digenously American” both in purpose
and tactics. The early activities of
the anti—slavery parties and the Lib-
erty party, the later activities of the
Greenback and Liberal ‘Republican
parties shortly after the Civil War pro-
vided the foundation of progressivism
in American political and social
thought and to some extent imbedded
its doctrines in the mores.

Has Its Defects

Progressivism, however, Dr. Hovde
maintained, has certain defects which
are very similar to those of liberalism.
It is incoherent, it tends toward make-
shift, and it can present no solid front
as can conservatism or communism.

Progressivism, said Dr. Hovde,
stands for.re,alism-1f It..postulates close
touch with the great body of popula-
tion and endeavors to keep one jump
ahead all the time.

“Will future leadership come from
the progressives or from a united front
of socialists and communists?” was
one of the ﬁrst questions asked in the
forum that followed the formal talk.

Answered Dr. Hovde, “I do not think
it will come from the united front.”

“What are the chances of progress-
ives penetrating down to the labor
classes?”

“Progressivism is bound to »com'e
from the bottom up.”

“Does the New Deal exhibit any of
the characteristics of progressivism?”
was the next question.

“Yes, it does," replied Dr. Hovde,
“in many of its aspects.” ’

‘fWhat was the makeup of the July
congress of the third party?” (This
referred to the meeting in Chicago last
summer of advocates of a third party.)

‘It was very heterogenous, composed
of people from the east with political
‘messages,’ farmers from the west and
others, I attended the congress as an
observer, however, and not as a dele-
gate.

“What are the chances for a third
party?”

“Not very great if you mean as far
as a presidential ticket for 1936 goes.”

Deans, Freshmen
Converse While
Fratres Chafe

Rushing season is over.

Silence week is on.

And still the professors and assist-
ant professors and instructors and as-
sistaigt instructors and even the grad-
uate assistants are complaining.

For while the late hours and fren-
zied activity which accompany the en-
tertainment of and intensive “conver-
sation” with prospective fraternity
men is but a memory, from all ac-
counts the suspense of waiting a
whole week to discover rushing re-
sults has not helped to decrease the
burden under which the brothers
seem to be traveling.

All this will be over Monday even-
ing at 5:30 o’clock when fraternities
will be notiﬁed of the acceptances and
declinations of their bids extended to
last week’s rushees.

Although this week is commonly
known as “silence week,” this is far
from true in the dean of men's oﬁlce.
The interviewing of freshmen, which
began Monday, has continued through-
out the week. The chairs and couch
are continually full, and a steady

-‘stream of freshmen opening the door

to Room 801, Cathedral, from both
sides gives evidence that rushing sea-
son was a success, at least according
to the number of bids extended.
During this week fraternity men
have said “Hello” to freshmen, have
smiled at them, and some of the more
daring have even winked at them,, but.
other than that, nary a Word. This
kind of stuff is supposed to worry
women, but you should see these men!

SFA. May Adopt
Club Probation

Ormer To Propose Short
Trial For New Groups

Van

A period of probation for all stu-
dent organizations desiring charters
from the Student Faculty Assembly
will be proposed by Dale Van Ormer,
E37, a member of the assembly.

Van Ormer was chosen by VVilliam
Harvey, C36, president of SFA, to
draw up a -tentative‘ list of rules for
procedure of the executive committee
in all cases where the question of
charter approval arises.

Said Van Ormer: “I will advocate
a probationary period of approximate-
ly six months during which the organ-
ization will be on trial. Any group
which presents the proper petition
and is successful in obtaining the
sanction of the executive committee
will be placed on trial. .

“For the past three years the execu-
tive committee has attempted to pass
upon all groups desiring charters im-
mediately. In 1931 and previously,
there was a probation period of ap-
proximately two years. I shall pro-
pose to strike a happy medium with
my plan and rules for procedure and
acceptance.

The executive committee of SFA
this week appointed three new mem-
bers to the committee on committees,
Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of Wom-
en, Ruth Shapiro, C37, and Charles
Herald, C36.

Fine Arts Group
To Exhibit Work

Done In Course

How would you like to take a
course in creative art methods and
ﬁnd yourself unknowingly doing work
which showed a surprising resem-
blance to that of Matisse and the mod-
ern French painters?

That is just what happened to stu-
dents whose work is being exhibited
this week in the Fine Arts library in
State Hall.

According to Philip C. Elliott, as-
sistant professor of ﬁne arts, the ex-
hibit produced by his last year’s class,
shows particualrly well the freshness
of conception and the technique _of
those without academic training which
modern sophisticated designers are
striving to recapture.

“Of course, there is a difference,”
explained Mr. Elliott, “between naive
freshness and sophisticated freshness.
The class, however, in its ﬁrst ex-
perience of doing its own work, pro-
duced some interesting material.”

The course, Mr. Elliott stated, is
principally not for art students, but
for the unskilled with some imagina-
tion and interest in art. The purpose
is to provide a general understanding
of painting.

Students may be admitted to the
second term with special permission
from the department of ﬁne arts.

‘Midsummer Night ’s Dream ’
Reservations Obtainable

Special student rates are obtainable
for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream"
which will be shown at the Nixon The-
ater during the week of October 28.

Caviedes’ ‘Elvira And Tiberio’ Awarded First Prize,

Americans Win Second And Third Places In international

Winning Painting Is Study‘
Of South American
Negro Couple

By P. Bernard Fleming

Spain rises to a position of pre-
eminence in the world of painting as
a young Spanish artist, Hipolito
I-Iidalgo de Caviedes of Madrid, wins
First Prize in the current Carnegie
Institute of International Exhibition
of Paintings which opened yesterday.
The painting is entitled “Elvira and

The Second Prize was awarded to
an American artist, Charles E. Burch-
ﬁeld of Gardenville, New York. The
painting is entitled "The Shed in the
Swamp.”

“Deep Vvater,” a painting of the sea,
by Henry Mattson of Woodstock, New
York, was awarded Third Prize.

First Honorable Mention was
awarded to Albert Saverys of Belgium
for his painting “Still Life.” Second
Honorable Mention went to Candido
Portinari, a Brazilian, for his painting
“Coffee.” Per Deberitz of Oslo, Nor-
way, was given Third Honorable Men-
tion for his painting “Sun and Sea.”
Sergius Pauser of ‘Vienna was award-
ed Fourth Honorable Mention for his
painting “Austrian Landscape.” The
Allegheny County Garden Club Prize
for the best painting of ﬂowers or a
garden was awarded to the distin-
guished French artist, Maurice de
Vlaminck, for his painting entitled
“Flowers.” ,

Caviedes, the Spanish artist who
was awarded First Prize, is 33 years
old and ﬁrst exhibited at the Carnegie
International in 1931. His prize-win-
ning painting, “Elvira and Tiberio,”
is decorative, sensitive, novel in its
color scheme and modern in concep-
tion. It shows a South American ne-
gro couple, all dressed up with ap-
parently no place to go. They are
seated on an Empire sofa. and are
posed stiffly as in an old daguerreo-

The Prize Winner:

type. It demonstrates that the artist
is very personal in the treatment of
his subject, refreshing, original, and
a master of drawing.

Burchﬁeld, the American artist who
won Second Prize, served on the
American Committee of Selection for
the 1930 International. His picture
which won Second Prize is, as prac-
tically all his work, in water color.
Yet, because of the way he handles
his medium and because of the size
of his pictures, the beholder thinks
of it as an oil painting. While still
a young man, he was a pioneer in the
now even increasing school of artists
who paint the" American scene. His
picture, “The Shed in the Swamp,” is
forceful and artistically well done.

Mattson of New York is-best known
by his aﬂiliation with the famous
Woodstock Colony in that state when

“Elvira and Tiberio,” by Caviedes

he studied landscape painting under
John Carlson. He ﬁrst exhibited in a
Carnegie International in 1927. His
“Deep Water” is highly individua.l in
treatment and profoundly simple.
Saverys, who was awarded First
Honorable Mention for his “Still Life,”
has exhibited before at the Interna-
tional and in 1928 won an Honorable
Mention for his painting, “Winter in
Flanders.” Perhaps the thing that
will strike the gallery most about his
painting is its unusual coloring.
Brazil, which is represented for the
ﬁrst time at the International, receives
Second Honorable Mention through
its artist, Candido Portinari for his
painting “Coffee.” The picture shows
a. deep feeling on the part of Portinari
and the sombre colors and heavy con-
ception of the ﬁgures aid in carrying

that impression.

Jury Of Award Composed
Of 3 American Artists,
3 Foreigners

Per Deberitz, who was awarded
Third Honorable Mention, was for a
time of pupil of Henri Matisse and his
work, which is mostly landscape,
shows a deﬁnite trend to the modern.
His painting, “Sun and Sea,” is his
ﬁrst exhibit in the International a11d
in the United States.

Sergius Pauser, the Austrian artist
who was awarded Fourth Honorable
I‘/lention, studied in Munich under
Becker-Gundahl, l-udwig von Her-
terich, and Gaspar. He first exhibited
in the United States in the 1931 Inter-
national.

The Jury of Award for the Exhibi-
tion was as follows: Alexander
Brooks, New York; John Steuart Cur-
ry, VVestport, Connecticut; Colin Gill,
London, England; Jonas Lie, New
York; Hendrik Lund, Olso, Norway;
and Isidore Opsomer, Antwerp, Bel-
gium, with Homer Saint Gaudens, di-
rector of ﬁne arts, Carnegie Institute
as Chairman of the Jury.

More nations are represented in
this year’s International than ever
before in its history. ’l‘wenty—one na-
tions have contributed groups of paint-
ings. Four countries, Argentine,
Brazil, Chile, and Mexico are repre-
sented for the ﬁrst time. Among these
artists are Orozco, Covarrubias, and
Siquieros.

Immediately after the close of the
exhibition in Pittsburgh on December
8, the entire foreign section will be
shown in Cleveland at the Cleveland
Museum of Art from January 2 to Feb-
ruary 14, 1936, and in Toledo at the
Toledo Museum of Art from March 7
to April '18, 1936.

During the time of the Exhibition,
the galleries will be open daily from
10 o’clock in the morning until 10
o’clock at night, and on Sundays from
2 to 6 o’clock in the afternoon.

Fraternities Hear
Plans Presented
By Council Head

Proposed Group Activities Include
Bonﬁres, Pep Rally, Dances;
Seek To Reduce Expenses

By Edwin Beachler

Every one of twenty-six members,
representing the 13 social houses on
the University campus, attended In-
terfraternity Council’s second meet-
ing of the year at the Sigma Alpha
Mu house, VVednesday evening.

Complete attendance was iot the
only thing that broke precedent at
the ﬁrst special meeting of the year.
After being slowed up momentarily
at the outset by discussion on athletic
competition, Edward M. Durkin, C36,
president of the Council, hurdled this
subject in full stride and presented a
seven-point program for investigation
and consideration.

Thirteen social houses immediately
granted him a unanimous vote of con-
ﬁdence. Interfraternity Council, by
this gesture, has now hauled in the
anchor and is clearing her decks for
action, according to the interfrater-
nity leader.

Point No. 1 in Durkin’s program
proposed student initiative in regard
to the present football season. A
“Greek-sponsored bonﬁre” including
the entire student body “will be ex-
cellent pre-game warm-ups on the
evenings prior to both the Army and
Nebraska. games.” Harry Zinsser,
M39, drew this investigation assign-
ment. ,

Along this same athletic line, No.
2 called for a student assembly to be
sponsored by lnterfraternity Council
on a Friday before one of the remain-
ing home games. James Nicholas,
E36, will handle this proposal.

Migratory dances between the vari-
ous social groups will form project
No. 3, which provides for approxi-
mately ﬁve campus affairs of this
kind within the year. H. W. Schenck,
Jr., C37, heads the first Interfrater-
nity informal dance on December 18,
replacing the annual Yuletide Festi-
val. The Iiiterfraternity Ball, of
course, will again dominate the Greek
dance program during the second se-
mester with Frank Frederick, C36,
chairman. Another informal is still
to be included in the social program,
probably. in the latter part of next
semester, quoted the report. ,

As point No. 4, the annual pledge
banquet and conference week will be
conducted by Ralph Appel, C36, chair-
man, beginning Tuesday, October 19

Discuss Tax Problem

Work toward a monthly fraternity
night, either in the form of a dance
or smoker, will come under the su-
pervision of Robert Bowdler, C36, for
point No. 5.

A committee to investigate the pos-
sibilities in reducing ﬁnancial respon-
sibilities at the individual houses will
start to function immediately, under
Howard Schweppe. C37, according to
Durkin’s sixth proposal. The possi-
bility of special rates from telephone
and light companies were suggested to
Schweppe.

Leo Ryan, C37. was named to in-
itiate a drive for University aid in the
tax problem confronting the 13 social
fraternity houses, the ﬁnal provision
in Durkin’s list.

His seven-point program will now
come under the scrutiny and investi-
gation of the executive committee in
council. This centralization in power
of action by the group will eliminate
time and waste incurred in the lar-
ger body.

Following up the ﬁrst two points,
Appel moved that a section be roped

off in the student cheering section at ,

the football games for group cheering
purposes. Agreement was unanimous.

On a suggestion by N. Robert
Siedle, assistant to the dean of men
and faculty adviser to fraternities, it
was decided to send a delegate to this
year’s convention of the National In-
terfraternity Council in New York
City late in November. Durkin was
unanimously selected as Council’s
representative, with Phillip Andrews,
C36, alternate.

Seidle also announced that the
Alumni Council requested a record of
fraternity programs during Home-
coming week-end on November 9. It
was suggested that all fraternities ob-
serve open house during this week-
end.

The Alumni Asscciation proposed a
donation of two cups to go to the
winners of exterior decoration com-
petition during the Homecoming
weekend. However, the motion of
William Harvey, C36, and president
of SFA, and the second of Gordon
Rauck, C37, to sponsor such a contest
among the social fraternities was de-
feated, 5-8. ~

The gist of the athletic competition
discussion was summed up by Har-
ve_v’s statement that soccer was too
vigorous for fraternity boys.

‘Y’ Retreat Held At Trinity

Manor Tomorrow, Sunday

 

Tomorrow and Sunday the Annual
Fall Retreat, sponsored by the YW-
YMCA, will be held at Trinity Manor.
The Retreat will offer chances for dis-
cussion of the major social and relig-
ious problems of the day. Dr. Doug-
las Steere of I-Iaverford College will
preside.

The group will leave on Saturday
afternoon at 1 o’clock from the First
Baptist Church, located on the corner

Praise For Pitt People

EVER-AL DAYS AGO a. visitor from New York
was admiring the Cathedral'lawn. He said
that it was the most beautiful expanse of

grass he had ever seen. Those of us who have
taken a good look at thatlawn and watched the
crew of workmen crack down on any weed wl1icl1
dares to show its head are certain that this gentle-
man from Gotham was making no idle compari-
sons.

The finest part of l1is praises came when he said,
“The students respect the grass and grounds. I
have been here three days and I have seen no stu-
dent abusing the lawn by tossing cigarets, paper,
or other litter around. The condition of the grass
and shrubbcry on the hillside campus also speaks

' 7)
well for the manners of the Pitt students.

That was a compliment worth passing along. To
some, the connection between a line looking lawn
and good manners may seem remote. But good
manners do extend even unto the little things. You
may not be able to judge a man ’s intelligence_ by
where he throws gum wrappers, but you certainly
can get. a line on l11s manners.

No one can tell how many visitors are put to
praising the University and its students by a look
at that lawn. That is a boost we shouldn’t ll1lSS.

The Shame Of A University

T’S RATHER HARD to do a little patting on
the back with one hand and clench the other
one to deliver a couple of blows. There seems

no more ﬁt.tin.g time, however, to take. a crack at
those arch-enemies of student society, those sur-
prisingly juvenile trouble-makers, the “chalk-
throwers.”

This rather odd species of student is up to the
old tricks. Tossing pieces of chalk from the win-
dows of the Cathedral, with a view to hitting some-
one walking down below, every so often becomes
an indoor sport with a certain group of sparsely-
brained fellows. Now a piece of chalk is 11ot or-
dinarily a formidable weapon; men have been
known to intercept tosses of the chalk with their
heads and live to tell the tale. The potentialities
of a piece dropped from an eighth ﬂoor window
are something else again.

\Ve don ’t believe that the students who throw
chalk are going to read this editorial. In fact, it
is hard to surmise just what students like that
would read at all. This, then, is intended to en-
courage you to take the situation. in hand when-
ever you see one of the little bombers getting
ready for a shot. Don ’t take the chalk from him
and return ﬁre with the enem.y weapons. No one
will mind if you scrap the chalk and go to work
with the nearest sledge-hammer.

the corner of N. Neville and Wallingford? No soap . . .
And M. V. Rosenbloom over at the Tri Delt house? Or
is it the other way around? VVho is the red headed gal,
initialed C. A., that the Kappa Sig football trio is inter-
ested in? Why did Jack McKee, Lambda Chi, stumble
around the block six times last Saturday night? Three
guesses-who for the lad to lead the Panhell ball with
Betty Kelly? VVhy was it that two W. Va. football play-
ers missed their ride home Saturday night? Or was it
Muriel Lambert?

Collembolae Plans
Trip Tomorrow

To Study Stone Formations,
Collect Fossils At Bear Cave

For the ﬁrst time in its history,
Collembolae, honorary natural science
traternity, will make a geology ﬁeld
trip. Scheduled for tomorrow, the
journey will be to Bear Cave and will
be led by Henry Leighton, head of the
department of geology.

Starting from the Cathedral at 8
o'clock in the morning, the members
will drive in private automobiles to
the Pennsylvania Railroad Hillside
Station, 50 miles east of Pittsburgh.
From there they will go to a stone
quarry on Chestnut Ridge. According
to Mr. Leighton, they will study the
underlying structure there and will
collect fossils from the greenbriar
limestone.

The group will then visit Bear Cave.
Although Collembolae has been mak-
ing trips for several years to Bear
Cave, this will be the first one it has
made for the study of geological for-
mations. All previous trips have been
made for botany or zoology.

Panthers Battle Strong Notre Dame Eleven
In Tomorrow’s Outstanding Gridiron Classic

National Honors
For Both Teams
Hinge 011 Game

Coach Sutherland_H-dpes To Have
Most Of Injured Players
Ready For Action ‘

By .'Harry Robinson
Sports Editor, The Pitt News

Vvith the eyes of the football world
focused upon them, two undefeated
and untied elevens, the Pitt Panthers
and the Notre Dame Ramblers, were
set to renew grid rivalry tomorrow
afternoon in the rectangular bowl at
South Bend, Indiana. Festivities are
scheduled to get under way at 2
o’clock, Central Standard Time.

A record—breaking crowd of aDP1‘0Xi-
mately 60,000 spectators is expected
to jam the Irish stadium to watch one
of the most important games on the
collegiate football calendar this sea-
son.

Hopes for a national championship
around Notre Dame headquarters this
season are the brightest since the late
Knute Rockne guided the football
destinies at the Indiana school.

In his second year as varsity coach
and director of athletics, Elmer Lay-
den has assembled an eleven which
has swept through all opposition en-
countered thus far this season. The
Ilamblcrs got off to a good start,
downing the Kansas Jayhawkers by
a 28-7 count. Althoug the Irish
found themselves behind; 3-0, at the
half in the Tech game, the South
Benders came back in the second half
to score a couple of touchdowns and
win 14-3.

Last Saturday Layden's outﬁt dem-
onstrated its ability before a large
crowd at Madison, Wisconsin to over-
whelm the Badgers, 27-0.

The Panthers likewise boast of a
perfect record as they swing into ac-
tion tomorrow. W'ay11esb1u'g, IV 8: J,
and \Vest Virginia have bowed to the
Sutherland machine this season.

As far as the scores can be com-
pared, the Ramblers have chalked u.p
69 points in the three games to 73
markers compiled by Pitt. Both teams
have had their goal line crossed once,
Kansas turning the trick against
Notre Dame while VVest Virginia ac-
complished it agaiiist the Panthers.

Lots Of Lettermen

Coach Layden has the advantage
of having 21 lettermen on his squad,
and the Notre Dame team which
lines up tomorow will probably have
nine monogram winners ﬁlling posi-
tions. The remaining two posts will
be handled by players who have had
at least a year’s experience.

At the ends, two veteran wingmen
will start. ‘Wayne Millner and ‘Marty
Peters, both lettermen, will probably
get the assignment. Both gentlemen
are accomplished pass - receivers,
Peters being responsible for sinking
the Navy last year by scoring a touch-
down through the pass route.

Coach Layden has been beset with
adversity at the tackle positions. The
untimely death of Joe Sullivan, cap-
tain-elect of the Irish, last winter
created a big gap in the line. Then
last Monday Johnny Michuta, varsity
player, was operated on for a head
injury which will keep him inactive
from gridiron warfare. Layden has
moved Harry Becker from the right
guard post to the tackle job formerly
held by l\-‘Iichuta and Dick Pfeiferle
will take care of the other side.

John Lautar, junior letterman, and
Jimmy Martin, reserve guard candi-
date, will likely start at left and right
guards, respectively, and Henry Poj-
man will handle the center’s duties.

A Moundsville, I-Vest Virginia pro-
duct, \.Va1ly Fromhart, will bark sig-
nals for the G-reenshirts. Bill Shakes-
peare and Victor VI-Iojcihovski appear
to have the inside track for halfback
posts, and either Don Elser or Fred
Carideo will get the 110d at fullback.

Layden alternated three teams
against the Badgers last Saturday, in-
dicating that reserves are plentiful.
Replacements in the backﬁeld include
Mike Layden, brother of the coach,
Bob Vvilke, 'l‘ony Mazziotti, the fast-
stepping Andy Pilney, and Francis
Gaul.

Pitt Lineup About Set‘

The Panthers will likely start the
same eleven that downed Vvest Vir-
ginia last Saturday, with the excep-
tion of a change at ends. Paul Shaw
will take Site's place at right end
while the latter will be shifted to the
other side of the line in Souchak’s
position. Souchak who is still
bothered by a leg injury probably will
get into the affair.

Thirty-four players made the trip
to South Bend, leaving Pittsburgh
last night at midnight. They will be
quartered at Niles, Michigan during
their stay in the midwest. This after-
noon the team will go through a dress
rehearsal in the Notre Dame stadium.

Pittsburgh has won the last three
games played against the Irish, and
a victory tomorrow will make the
series all-even. Prior to the ﬁrst Pan-
ther win in 1932, the Ramblers had
beaten the locals on four occasions.
with one game ending in a deadlock.

The Irish line will average approxi-
mately 191 pounds and the backﬁeld
will pack about a 180 pounds to a
man.. This would make the team
average about 187 pounds.

stretch, after pacing the ﬁeld by 30
yards in his single appearance during
the games.

Cooper shot through a 10 seconds
ﬁat “Century” in the face of a stiff
wind. Routch was three steps behind,
followed closely by Rivilin, W'est Vir-
ginia state champ. Poole of Union-
town, former VVPIAL. winner, failed
to place.

The two-mile grind aroused the in-
terest of spectators during the entire
eight-lap ding-do11g battle between
Zamborsky, Bonarati, and Powers.
Less than three yards separated these
three men during the ﬁrst two laps.
On the third trip around the Stadium
oval, Bonarati pushed ahead to take
the lead by some four yards. Zam-
borsky ran easily in second with
Powers just a step back.

Bonorati held his advantage nicely
until the sixth round when both Zam-
borsky and Powers came up fast
Momentarily, Zamborsky, Scott High
runner, dropped back to the third po-
sition with Zamborsky and Powers
dashing down the straight-a-way on
the tunnel-side of the ﬁeld. Then on
the seventh lap, Zamborsky made his
bid, running smoothly, to overtake
the leaders. The short, long-striding
boy from North Braddock increased
his lead on the “gun” lap to ﬁnish in
the good time of 11:07 minutes.

Cogswell ‘Wins Mile

Cogswell ﬁnished ﬁrst in the mile.
leading the entire route, with a mark
of 5:066. Zamborsky and Powers,
both weak from the longer distance
run_ took second and third, respec-
tively.

Routch outjumped Poole and Rivi-
lin in the broad jump with a leap of
20 feet 7 inches. In the pole vault
event, Dines cleared the bar at 10
feet 6 inches in the pole vault, follow-

. ed by McArdle and Fox.

Filson was an easy winner in the
half mile, breaking the tape in 12:14.2.
Harris tossed the spear 144 feet 6
inches to outdistance Hamilton and
\Va1msle_v in the javelin throw.

The 125-piece University band open-
ed the novice games and continued to
at intervals during the 13
track and ﬁeld events. After the
javelin throw, the ﬁnal event, Cap-
tain Tredennick drilled the squad in
maneuvers in preparation for future
football games.

Africa Speaks!

“Hough For Panther” Group
Started Out In California
By Mr. J. T. Africa.

You’vei all heard much ballyhoo
about Huey Long’s “Share the

Wealth” campaign, about Upton Sin-
clair’s EPIC, about Townsend’s “Old
Age Pension,” about the recent
“VVhiSDering” campaign, about Seth
Parker clubs. about Christmas Sav-
ings clubs, “but you ain’t heard nuthin’
ye.”

Out on the Paciﬁc coast, the natives
of the little town of Huntington Beach,
California, are boosting a “Hough for
Panther Club" campaign. This Hough
gentleman, a former Pitt graduate, is
being heralded by his fellow towns--
men to act as the Panther for the foot-
ball contest between the University
of Pittsburgh and the University of
Southern California on December 14.

Dr. Douglas H. Hough has on pre-
vious occasions performed the oﬂicial
duties of the Panther in such a man-
ner worthy to bring favorable com-
ment. Since graduating from the Uni-
versity, Dr. Hough has set up‘ a prac-
tice in dentistry at Huntington Beach,
California.

To date, J. T. Africa, president of
the “Hough for Panther Club,” has
collected 132 of the most prominent
names in Huntington Beach. Among
those duly sworn and in good stand-
ing are: J. Hurton,
Gelges, Chief of Police, Jack Robert
son, Huntington Beach High School
football coach, H. F. Dundy, sole
owner of four city blocks, VV. H.
Gallierme, secretary of the Chamber
of Commerce, Sherman Emery, treas-
urer and director of the ‘Chamber of
Commerce, J. K. Sargent, ﬁre chief,
Roy Patrick, commander of Legion
Post No. 133, Paul Bowen, manufac-
turer, D. T. Tarbox, Evangelist, and
Bill Bert, “Sea Breeze” mayor.

The faithful subjects of Huntington
Beach have forwarded the petition to
VV. Don Harrison, director of Univer-
sity athletics, for official approval.

Scholastic Scribe
Rates Pitt Team
Over Notre Dame

“Loss Of Regular Linemen Leaves
Ramblers With Inexperienced
Forward Wall,” He Says

By Jim McMuIIen
Sports Writer, Notre Dame Scholastic

Saturday, the Irish of Notre Dame
face their nemesis of Coach Rockne’s
days, the powerful Panthers of Pitts-
burgh. After a none too impressive
showing against Wisconsin last week,
Irish hopes took a sudden nose dive.
Then came the news of the loss of
Johnny Michuta, regular and veteran
tackle. Shaken, the Notre Dame cam-
pus conﬁned its hapless crew to the
role of underdog—and as such Elmer
Layden’s boys enter their first big test.

Last. spring, Notre Dame foresaw
a great veteran line, one that would
stand up with the best in the country.
Misfortune was soon to shatter its
hopes. Captain-elect Joe Sullivan con-
trac‘:ed a disease that even his stout
heart could not overcome; All-Ameri-
can Jack Robinson was ruled ineligi-
ble for center competition this fall;
vetertn bua.rd Bill Smith fell by the
wayside with an operation; and ﬁnally
this week, lx-Iichuta was forced to with-
draw. The great line is left with only
one veteran of last year, VVayne Mill-
ner, of Yankee descent.

Layden has worked hard to ﬁll the
gap. To meet the latest emergency
he has shifted Harry Becker from
guard to tackle, and moved Pepper
Martin, shock-trooper, into the vacated
guard post. The backﬁeld is an all-
veteran affair. The Panthers should
need no introduction to such men as
Shakespeare, Carideo, 1L.ayden, and
Fromhart. The courtesies could be
dropped again when Elser, Pilney,
Gaul, and V\70jClhOVSkl rush in as re-
placements. The made-over line will
do their best to make a good ﬁrst im-
pression on the lads of Sutherland.

Coach Layden has worked the squad
this week purely on fundamentals. If
the Panthers look at clean blocking
and tackling, the Irish mentor is con-
vinced they have a chance to look at
an unfriendly scoreboard. Notre Dame
has conceded its position second
choice, but Notre Dame never con-
cedes a game.

Net Tdiirnament
Gets Under Way

Perfect Tennis Weather Prevails
For Start Of Annual Event

VVith weather perfect enough to de-
light the heart of any tournament
chairman, the second annual Univer-
sity men’s tennis tournament began
Wednesday. ,

Alexander Wilson, sophomore from
St. Petersburg, Florida and Bob Oib-
ney took the court at 2 o’clock for the
ﬁrst match. In an hour, however,
most of the courts were in use either
for other matches, or in most cases,
for players trying to loose11 up their
arms after a month’s layoff.

Eugene Cohen, tournament chair-
man, says, “Due to the limited play-
ing conditions at this time of year, all
ﬁrst and second round matches not
played by Monday will be forfeited.

Cohen says that the Trees courts
will be open all day tomorrow for
ma.tches. Any player who has not yet
made connections with his opponent.
is advised to go to the courts and put
his telephone number beside his name
on the bulletin board at once. When
there is any forfeiting done, the play-
er who hasn’t posted his telephone
number will be the one who forfeits.

In the ﬁrst round matches played.
Bob Gibney defeated Alex Willson ir,
a closely-contested fray by scores of
5-7, 6-3, 6-3; Tom Locke whitewashed
Jim Jonston in love sets; and Eugene
Grennau performed the same feat
against E. '1‘. Sage.

Ed Ellis beat Jack Bellas, 6-0, 6-2,
and Ben V-Vood took over J. G. Rob-
....en, 6-3, 6-1.

Harriers Atte_mpt
To Set Example

Compete With Notre Dame Prior
To Panther—Irish G-rid Game

Seven runners, Coaches Olson and
Potts, and Student Manager Clyde
Claus, boarded the Pitt special cars
at the Pennsylvania station last night.
for a. dual cross—country engagement
with Notre Dame at South Bend, to-
morrow.

Today, they rest comfortably in this
national football hot-bed with only a
light workout scheduled for the Car-
tier track this afternoon. Red Tost
is the only Panther runner remaining
from last season’s Junior AAU cham-
pions, white-washers of the Rambler
squad over the hilly Schenley Park
course.

Cook, Groat, and Leggin, in that or-
der, are Olson's hopes for a Pitt vic-

, tory in the meet at 11 o’clock tomor-

row morning over the ﬂat Indiana
layout. 'I‘ost should win handily, ac-
cording to present indications. As
these other three Pitt runners ﬁnish,
so will Olson’s squad ﬁnish. Theriault,
Emens, and Nordstrom, sophomores,
a.re expected to battle for ﬁfth posi-
tion in the Panther score.

Coach Nicholson of the Irish will
send last year's team intact against
the local hill-and-dalers in their ﬁrst
start of the current season. Olson’s
gloom over the outcome of the meet
“sees absolutely no hope for his team
against Notre Dame.”

Crawford To Speak
At Student Assembly

An assembly in honor of Dr. Stan-
ton C. Crawford, new dean of the Col-

lege, will be held on October 30 in
Memorial Hall. All students in the
college will be released from second
hour classes on that date to attend
the assembly.

Dr. Crawford will be the main
speaker. He will be introduced by
Paul Keiser, C36, president of the Col-
lege Association.

A College" Association cabinet meet-
ing which has been called for this
afternoon will be held in Room 102,
Alumni Hall at 3:30 o’clock.
