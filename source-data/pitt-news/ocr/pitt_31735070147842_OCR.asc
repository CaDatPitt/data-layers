Jobs in nuclear industrystill an option

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Stajf Writer

Should the nuclear near—meltdown
injapan shake Erik Croushore?
Erik Croushore took an intem-
ship at Westinghouse Electric Co.
in late 2009, thinking he was on his
way toward landing a full-time job
' in Western _Pennsylvania’s growing
nuclear energy industry. ‘
Croushore, a senior in‘ the Uni-
versity’s nuclear engineering cer-
tiﬁcate program, may still get a job
despite fears that the nuclear indus-

try might beentering yet another

period of stagnation.

While Japan’s crisis has ‘trig-
gered new debate over the safety
of nuclear power, it is unclear what
the ﬁiture of nuclear power will be in
Pennsylvania or what students’ job
prospects will be down the road.

Complications persist at the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
plant in Japan after the March 11,
9.0-magnitude earthquake that
rocked the island nation and shut
down the power plant’s active nucle-
ar reactors. Workers are still strug-
gling to keep the overheating cores
of the reactors cool, and growing
concerns over nuclearenergy safety
make it unclear whether U.S. regula-

torswill continue approving permits
for new nuclear power plants.
While the unfolding disaster
in Japan did not have an effect on
Croushore’s job prospects with
Westinghouse -— a global com-
petitor in nuclear power based in
Cranberry — he is worried that the
crisis might reduce consumer faith
in nuclear power and impede the
likelihood he could land a job in the
ﬁeld in the more-distant future.‘
Croushore plans to work for Pro-
cess Combustion Corp. after gradua-
tion, an engineering company based
in Pittsburgh that isn’t involved in

the nuclear industry. But he wants

to keep the nuclear engineering cer-
tiﬁcate on his resume‘ and see what
happens in the future.

Workers in the nuclear industry
say it might be too early tell what
impact the crisis will have on the
production of nuclear energy na-
tionally and in Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is home to ﬁve
nuclear power plants,'the second-
most of any state. The nuclear plants
generate about 35 percent of the
state’s total electricity, whereas coal
plants generate 48 percent.

Concert 
held for
‘Dec’

Gwenn Barney
Senior Stajf Writer

Every Saturday afternoon during
his childhood, G. Alec Stewart
scampered into his living room and
twisted the dials of the family radio
until he found the station he was
looking for — the one that played
the Metropolitan Opera. '
These afternoons listening to
the Metropolitan Opera were the
beginning of what eventually be-
came a lifelong love of music for
Glenn Alexander ‘Doc’ Stewart,
the man who would become the
founding dean of Pitt’s Honors
College. '

Even though Stewart, who died -

one year ago this week, spent a
large portion of his time dedi-
cated to the Honors College, he
always made time for music, even
sponsoring the Puppies! a cappella

group in 2007. The group broke up ‘

in 2008, but reunited for Sunday’s
concert.

That consideration inspired
Puppies! member Michael McKib-
ben to begin in December to plan’
a memorial concert for the late
Honors College dean.

McKibben worked closely
with senior Utsav Bansal and the
Student Honors Activity Council
over the course of four months to
bring the concert, which took place
yesterday afternoon in Frick Fine
Arts, to fruition.

“This is pretty much an entirely
student-run initiative,” McKibben
said.

on alcohol
meeting

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Details about a discussion on a possible alcohol
amnesty policy remained hidden from most

students when SGB members met with Pitt’s

Alcohol Task Force in a private meeting Friday
afternoon and both parties declined to answer
questions afterward.

Nearby universities like Temple and Carn-
egie Mellon offer underage drinkers amnesty
from punishment when seeking medical atten-
tion after drinking, a policy that Pitt chooses

i» not to implement. .
Friday’s meeting came after more than a
semester of debate between students and ad-
ministrators about the merits of such a policy
and after an investigation by The Pitt News into

the laws behind campus alcohol policies;

“What we really wanted to do was  a
conversation between the administratiori and

loy said that the ﬁrst time he met Stewart, .

he informed the clean that he would not be
around the Honors College often because he
planned to major in music. Rather than at-
tempting to convince Malloy to spend more

time in the Honors College, Stewart carried ‘

on an in—depth conversation with Malloy
about music.

“One thing that really struck me was how
much he loved music,” Malloy, now a senior,
said, speaking to the event’s audience of
about 60 people. ,

A Contributions provided by thosein at-
tendance beneﬁted the G. Alec Stewart
Memorial Book and Resource Fund, which
will provide books and other resources and

materials for students of the University Hon— -

ors College. .

Carolyn Stewart, the late dean’s wife, at-
tended the concert. A

“They did a beautiful job,”_ Carolyn Stew-
art said. “He would have loved it that they
honored him with music.” ..

The show began with an introduction
from Malloy, who took the auditorium stage
dressed in an all—black suit. All the perform-
ers sang beneath a projected picture of Doc
Stewart, which had the y€3.I'S‘:j0f his life,Janu-
ary 14, 1941 — April 7, 2010, listed below.

C Flat Run, a student a cfappella group,
took the stage ﬁrst and performed a mix of

upbeat and ballad music. Group member and
sophomore Eric Weaver especially felt that
the group’s rendition of Sting’s “Fields of
Gold” was appropriate for the occasion.
' “The lyrics just really make you feel the
mood of the event,’’ Weaver said. “It has
spiritual meaning.” _

No update on amnesty policy for Pitt

the students,” SGB member Alex Zimmerman
said after the meeting.

But the conversation has not reached stu-
dents.

Anna Vitriol, ahealth educator at Pitt’s Stu-
dent Health Service, declined to comment,
directing all questions about the meeting and
what was discussed to Pitt’s media relations.

Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs Robert
Hill responded with a statement from the
Division of Student Affairs, which remained
relatively tight—1ipped about the subject.

The statement conﬁrmed that the SGB
members requested to speak to the Alcohol
Task Force about the arrmesty policy and will
continue to do so,but representatives did not
explain ﬁnther. " -

“We anticipate meeting with members of
SGB in the future to continue the conversa-
tion about alcohol use on campus and gather
feedback from them regarding ways in which
the ATF can continue to assist students and
educate the campus community, particularly

the student body,” the statement said.

The statement added that the Alcohol Task
Force invited SGB to appoint a representative
to the Alcohol Task Force meetings because the
task force values SGB’s “opinions and views as
representatives of the student population.”

During last week’s SGB meeting, Zimmer-
man said that he, along with Board members
Emily Hoover andjames Landreneau, requested
the meeting with the Alcohol Task Force after
several students approached them about the
possibility of developing an amnesty policy.

“Ultimately, there are student concerns,”
he said last Tuesday.

The concerns center around Pitt’s adher-
ence to an alcohol policy that allows Pitt police
to cite underage students for drinking, even if
they are seeking medical attention.

Underage Pitt students, found drinking by
University police, regardless of their medi-
cal condition, are subject to criminal citations
and University judicial sanctions. In addition,

. any students found “knowingly present” atan

alcohol violation on campus are also subject to
University sanctions, according to the Student
Code of Conduct.

SGB previously met with Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno
to discuss CMU°s alcohol policy, which allows
underage students to seek medical attention
without legal ramiﬁcations.

Student Affairs said in its statement that
about half of Pitt’s Alcohol Task Force is com-
prised of students. .

Landreneau declined to comment after the
meeting about the meeting because of the is-
sue’s “sensitivity.”

Hill made one comment about the issue
independently of Student Affairs, responding
to a request for an update about Pitt and an
amnesty policy. l _

“The University has responded extensively
to this previously forThe Pitt News and has
nothing new to add,” he wrote. A

Mouser works as a programs engineer at the
Beaver Valley Power Station. ‘

“A disaster at any nuclear power plant
will signiﬁcantly affect every other plant in
operation, no matter where in the world it’s
located,” he said.

Fukushima Daii_chi’s effect on the U.S.

Nuclear power is the number one source of
emission—free electricity in United States, and
accounts for about 20 percent of electricity
generated. It accounts for slightly less world-
wide — 14 percent, as estimated in 2009 by
the Nuclear Energy Institute, a global policy
organization that promotes the use of nuclear
energy and technology.

At the beginning of this year, 29 countries
worldwide were operating 442 nuclear reac-
tors to generate electricity, and there are 65
new plants under construction in 15 coun-
tries.

Congress has already begun looking into
the safety of U.S. nuclear power plants.

In the U.S. there are 31 states operating 104
nuclear reactors. Five cities in Pennsylvania
have operating nuclear power plants, includ-
ing the infamous Three Mile Island plant in
Londonderry Township where a cooling sys-
tem failed in 1979 causing a reactor to over-
heat and a core to partially melt.

The Senate Appropriations subcommit-

tee on Energy & Water Development held a .

hearing last Thursday to discuss what lessons
can be learned from the Tokyo Electric Power
Co. disaster.

Gregoryjaczko, chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, told the subcom-
mittee that a task force had been created to
do a review of “all technical and policy issues

related to the event,” according to a statement
on the commission’s website.

The commission is a government—created
agency in charge of setting rules governing the
operation of nuclear plants. A more extensive

review, scheduled to last six months, will be— '

gin as more information becomes available,
Jaczko said in the statement.

Michael Ramsey, a Pitt geology professor
who currently teaches alcourse called Natural
Disasters, said there were plans to increase the
use of nuclear power in ‘United State before
this latest accident called into question its
safety and reliability.

No new nuclear plants have been built in
the United States for more than 30 years —

since the Three Mile Island incident, Ramsey i

said.

The NRC was issuing new permits to build
plants, but that progress is likely to slow or
stop as reviews are conducted on the safety
of nuclear plants because of the situation at
Fukushima_Daiichi, the professor said.

“The good thing is that, in Pa., we do not
get large earthquakes/tsunamis that other
states could get,” he said in an e-mail. “I think
the chances of something similar to Japan
happening here are very, very small.” A

Working with Atomic Power

. Mouser said he did not have any fears
about working at a nuclear power plant.

After graduating in May 2010, he ﬁrst did .

a co—op at AES Beaver Valley Inc., a coal-pow-
ered plant, before deciding to take a full—time

position with the nuclear plant at BVPS. The_
- decision to work in the‘ nuclear ﬁeld was not

easy, but Mouser said that state plans to build
new plants and expected job security factored
into his decision.

Others agreed that the industry would
likely only continue to grow in the future.
Enrollment in Pitt’s nuclear certiﬁcate classes
has sextupled, from about 50 students in the
2006-07 academic year to just under 300
this academic year, director of the nuclear
engineering programjohnp Metzgar said.

Mouser said Beaver Valley is at high risk
for earthquakes, but the plant has “back-up
plans upon back—up plans in place to mit_igate
damage following such a disaster.” _ _

Tokyo Electric Power had similar contin-

. gency plans in place, and after the earthquake. .

struck the plant shut down safely in seconds,

"as expected, Mouser said.

“It was not until water from the tsunami
reached the station and destroyed emergency
generators that things started to go downhill,”

he said, noting that tsunamis are not‘some- V

thing that Beaver Valley has to worry about.
Still, Mouser said nuclear plants around
the world are constantly communicating to
help improve safety conditions.
Metzgar said he could not predict what

' the impact would be on the growth of nuclear
, energy nationally, or in Pennsylvania at this

time, other than possible new regulatory re-
sponses from the commission.

The industry is looking at each plant to en-
sure each is prepared for any natural disaster
that a given area may be at risk to experience,
Metzgar said. ‘

However, he said to keep in mind that, “the
earthquake and tsunami were well beyond

what was anticipated and ever experienced in '

modern history, and I am not speaking only
about the nuclear industry, butjapan.”

Gold was one of four people to judge the

by Hillel Jewish University Center Sunday
night, from which Terry walked away with
a second-place title and $1,000.

Two students from Pitt, ﬁve from Car-

comprised the group of students competing
for the title of Campus Superstar. .

Four judges provided feedback for the

voted using colored slips of paper.

The title eventually went to Carnegie Mel-
lon junior Gillian Hassert, who won $5,000
for her rendition of “Down With Love” from
the musical “Hooray for What!”

Cardin an okay
speaker choice

Not every school can snag the
president to speak at commence-
ment, and We’re okay with that.

Last week, Pitt announced that
Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.,
will speak at Pitt’s commence-
ment ceremony on May 1.

Some students on campus ad-
mittedly didn’t know who Cardin
was,, and others proved unen-
thused.

We admit that even we ini-
tially found Pitt’s selection to be
lackluster — likely inﬂuenced
by our disappointment in last
year’s speech delivered by John
Swanson as well as our knowl-
edge of the big bucks other uni-
versities shell out for big—name
speakers. Rutgers University in
New Jersey, for example, reeled
in Nobel Prize—winning novelist
Toni Morrison with a check for
$30,000, according to The New
York Times.

But we ultimately think Cardin
is an appropriate choice for this
year’s commencement, especially
because of student discontent
with looming budget cuts almost
certain to impact Pitt’s tuition.

In addition, We’re glad the Uni-
versity doesn’t shell out cash for
celebrity speakers. Pitt spokes-
woman Amanda Ritchie said the
University does not customarily
pay fees to its commencement
speakers.

“Most individuals invited to
serve in that role consider the
opportunity to deliver our com-
mencement and to receive an
honorary degree to be a privi-
lege,” Ritchie said in an e—mail.
“Typically, then, the only expens-
es connected with a speaker’s ap-
pearance are the reimbursement
of normal travel fees, and even
they are sometimes waived.”

Penn State also doesn’t cus-
tomarily write checks for its
commencement speakers, PSU
spokeswomanjill Shockey ‘said.

As a tradition, Temple Uni-
versity doesn’t enlist speakers
for graduation, although honor-
ary degrees are presented during
the commencement ceremony,
Temple spokeswoman Eryn Je-
lesiewicz said.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
selected Cardin from a list of po-
tential speakers approved by the
Special Committee for Honors
Convocation and Commencement
Speakers and Honorary Degree
Recipients, which is made up of
14 faculty members and senior
administrators.

“The chancellor has demon-

strated a clear preference for V

distinguished graduates of the
University who have built lives of
achievement and impact,” Ritchie
said. In Nordenberg’s opinion,
those with Pitt degrees are most
able to inspire current graduates
and to demonstrate the “power of
a Pitt education,” she said.

Commencement Speaker
Committee chair and associate
chancellor Vijai Singh said, “The
committee seeks to ﬁnd individu-
als who embody the ideals of the
University: high achievement,
humanitarian commitment and
a meaningful engagement in a
life of purpose.”

In addition, candidates should
have:

-attained eminence in the
their ﬁeld .

-contributed to the develop-
ment of their ﬁeld and

-been recognized for innova-
tion or Valuable public service.

At a ceremony in which gradu-
ating students don’t even hear
theirnames called, the Univer-
sity can’t afford to underestimate
how much the commencement
speaker impacts the quality of
the event. We’re therefore sin-
cerely glad to see that Pitt puts
forth so much effort in choosing
a speaker.

But even the most established
alumni can fail to deliver words
of wisdom to Pitt graduates.

So as long as they deliver a
captivating speech, we don’t
mind Pitt’s somewhat frugal hab-
it of booking alumni to deliver
the commencement address. All
Cardin needs to do to impress
us is refrain from talking about
aliens. Really, what was that all
about, Swanson?I

dealt with since shortly after the
signing of the Constitution, and

you’ll likely get in reply the usual '

suspects of Britain and France,
with the occasional history whiz
also mentioning Spain. Few will
mention Libya. And yet arguably
the ﬁrst overseas war the United
States ever fought was in what is
now Libya.

The Tripolitan War, also
known as the First Barbary War,

critical,.is complaining that the
U.S. and allied militaries are actu-
ally dropping bombs.

Meanwhile, President Barack
Obama is saying that the tyrant
who has ruled Libya for 42 years,
the inexplicably under—ranked
Col. Moammar Gadhaﬁ, has to go
— a view echoed by the French.
So as the missiles ﬂy, there is dis-
agreement as to what it is we are
supposed to be doing.

Is our military trying to help
the rebels win? Are we hoping
to get lucky and kill Gadhafi, a
move which has been frowned
upon ever since Gerald Ford is-
sued Executive Order 11905 in
1976, banning political assas-

‘a case like this is the U.S., but
President Obama is desperately
trying to avoid having the U.S.
even look like it’s in charge. _
So to summarize, there is a
varied group of countries trying
to achieve different, undeﬁned
objectives at the same time,
while doing so together and co-
operatively. These aren’t good
arrangements for assuring coop-
eration, and none whatsoever for
resolving the conflicts between
different aims. One of the coun-
tries that has been shouting for
military action, the U.S., is now
trying to stay just close enough to
the action to get credit if things
go right, but far enough away to

was fought from 1801 to 1805.
The tiny U.S. Navy was deployed
against the Barbary Pirates, who
had routinely harassed foreign
shipping and demanded ransom
money from Americans. Now,
206 years later, we ﬁnd ourselves
back outside Tripoli under differ-
ent circumstances, with a mis-
sion that is much less clear than
was the defeat of pirates. .

The United States, along with
numerous other countries un-
der the aegis of U.N. Resolution
1973, is currently involved in
military action over Libya. But
we don’t know what form that
action is supposed to take. The
U.N. resolution merely autho-
rizes “all necessary measures”
to protect the civilian population
of Libya, without any occupation
by troops. The Arab League, how-
ever, whose support for the U.N.
resolution was seen as politically

sination? Are we just trying to
prevent civilian casualties? Or
are we simply trying to enforce
a no—ﬂy zone?

We cannot even begin to think
about raising the “Mission Ac-
complished” banner until we
know what the mission is.

Even worse than not know-
ing our purpose is notknowing
who is in charge of deﬁning it.
Although’ NATO has assumed
command in Libya, at least two
key members of the organiza-
tion, Turkey and Germany, are
less than enthusiastic about the
change in command. Meanwhile,
the small but politically-crucial
military contingents of Arab
League members such as the
United Arab Emirates and Qatar
couldn’t fall under NATO control
unless the governments of those
nations explicitly allowed them
to. The most obvious leader in

avoid censure for anything bad
that happens. '

Is this not farcical? Is it not
sounding awfully like a Gilbert
and Sullivan operetta, complete
with modern major generals?

It would all be comical were
it not for the serious stakes in-
volved. My fear is that, despite
all our hopes and intentions, we
could end up seeing ourselves

more deeply entangled in Libya _

than we would have liked.

The reason for entanglement
lies in the answer to a vital ques-
tion few are asking. What hap-
pens if Gadhaﬁ manages a tie with
the rebels and remains in power,
which is a possible outcome con-
sidering the rebels aren’t advanc-
ing even with Western support?

place, we will have to continue
protecting Libyan civilians.

Leaving Libya now and let-
ting Gadhaﬁ conduct massacres
wouldn’t be palatable. This means
either we: 1) get rid of Gadhaﬁ
ourselves or 2) keep Gadhaﬁ and
work to protect his people. The
former option means a larger
up—front commitment and, very
possibly, ground troops. The
latter option means long—term
involvement that might or might
not work. Maybe we’ll get lucky
and Gadhafi will be toppled by
some sort of palace coup, but
considering that this didn’t hap-
pen when he was on the ropes in
early March, there’s little reason
to think it will happen now.

Would the world be better
off if Gadhafi were gone? Sure.
The guy is a brutal thug who has
sponsored terrorism in the past
andbutchered his own people.
But the world is full of people like
that, as we are being reminded
in Syria, Iran, the Ivory Coast
and elsewhere. What we need to
do first is decide what exactly
our objective is in Libya. Then
we have to decide whether that
objective is worth escalation of
the war. It is highly irresponsible
for Obama to pretend the current
muddled military situation is a
good one, and it is disingenuous
at the least to say that we might
not get embroiled further. ,

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

Matt Kosko’s letter from April 1 brings up some interesting points, but it also gets a few things incorrect. Our government is in fact not a

sovereign issueriof currency. The Federal Reserve controls our monetary policy, and thus our supply of money. Contrary to the name, it oper——

ates independently of the government and its decisions are not controlled by the executive or legislative branches. Our government is thus not
a sovereign issuer of currency. i

Additionally, we cannot simply print money to meet ﬁnancial obligations. An increase in the money supply will always lead to inﬂation, which
devalues our dollar. One dollar in 2010 had the same buying power as 5 cents in 1914, which shows the power of inﬂation on the value of our dol-
lar. Printing too much money at one time is an even greater problem and can easily lead to hyperinﬂation. Having to pay for a loaf of bread with
a wheelbarrow full of cash is not something we want to happen. A - 1

Perhaps the bigger issue is indeed one that stems from the Federal Reserve and the inﬂationary nature of our system. Money saved today,
perhaps for retirement, will ultimately be worth less in the ﬁiture due to the printing of more and more money and the resulting inﬂation. Though
taxes, such as FICA, do detract from the earnings of workers, the hidden tax of inﬂation — making our money worth less every year — is one
that will continue to rob American citizens blind. . c

To the Editor,

Student Government Board members don’t often feel compelled to make public statements, but quite frankly I am appalled by the actions of my fel-
low Board members. ~ '

For instance, every morning Board member Laurenjentleson comes into the office and tries to get me to clean the mountains of junk from my desk,
take down my monument to former SGB President Charlie Shull and stop blasting Trick Daddy’s classic “I’m a Thug” so she can work on her “Board
projects.” Come on, L]. Everyone knows that “Board projects” is just code for sit in your cubicle, eat lunch and watch YouTube. Geez.

Also, what’s up with SGB President Molly Stieber acting like she’s my boss? Every day it’s “Hasley, have you scheduled that meeting yet?” or “Hasley,
I need that proposal by 3 p.m.!” Where is the love, Stiebs? As a Board member, I need to be appreciated for my work. That means no work on weekends,
half days every Friday, frequent cat naps and numerous interns to wipe my bottom, change my diaper and burp me whenever I’m feeling upset. Clearly,
President Stieber can’t relate. I V

To The Editor,

In the past few weeks, students have made it clear that a 50 percent cut in Pitt’s state appropriation will be harmful. I believe that this cut doesn’t go
far enough —— and as a student leader I will not stand idly by. Students have been ﬂaunﬁng their disposable incomes for years through academic “bling”
like $300 biology textbooks. And students continue to accept government handouts like subsidized transit, free newspapers and clean water, as if they
are somehow entitled to them. This ﬁscallyiirresponsible consumption must be put to an end, and when the state fails to act, what better organization
than Student Government Board to intervene? _ '

If Gov. Tom Corbett is unwilling to propose the cuts necessary to cut down on irresponsible student spending, SGB ought to increase the student
activities fee to $10,000 per semester. This plan would employ exactly what Corbett does not have: the political will to force students to take on more
debt. Shovel-ready initiatives like creating a zip—line from Sutherland Hall to the 20th ﬂoor of the Cathedral or getting rid of the smell by Tower C could
become a reality. I look forward to taking this up with my Student Government colleagues in the coming weeks, and I encourage all students to come out
to Pitt Day in Harrisburg to tell their legislators that a 50 percent cut won’t be nearly as devastating as it should be. I

Another delayed April Fools’ joke, I ~\_

’Burgh fans gather tocelebrate anim

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

Instead of bellhops and tour-
ists, the Wyndham Grand Ho-
tel, Downtown, was overrun this
weekend with images of Pokemon
and many other vestiges ofJapa—
nese culture.

About 4,000 people — includ-
ing some Pitt students —— were
expected to gather in the hotel
for Tekkoshocon IX — the ninth
installment of Pittsburgh’s Japa-
nese pop-culture convention. The
event, which celebrates the ani-
mation, music and video games
of Tokyo and otherjapanese cit-
ies, is evidence of the growing
role Japanese art is playing in
American culture.

Whilejapanese culture might
seem marginalized within main-
stream American media, to some
Pitt students and people else-
where this growing countercul-

ture is an important art form.

From Thursday through Sun-
day, vendors set up stalls to sell
specialty products, voice actors
answered questions at panels and
attendees joined in on many man-
ners of anime fun. For those more
interested in playing Video and
card games or even just reading
manga —Japanese comic books
— in quiet, there was ample
space to serve their tastes.

Throughout all of the events
was a deep and profound appre-
ciation for the culture of Japan
and, in light of the recent earth-
quakes that devastated parts of
the country, an empathy for its
citizens. .

“We definitely feel a lot for
Japan,” said Randy Tobias, a Pitt
seniorand video program orga-
nizer for the event. “We’ve set up
a couple charitable things that
are going toward Japan. Obvi-
ously, we’re not just a conven-

tion about anime, we’re not just
a convention about video games

 we’re students of Japanese

culture.”

Dan Pinsky a Pitt senior and
co—creator of “Anime in Ameri-
ca,” a trailer made last year for
a documentary about the culture

behind such conventions, noted .

the dedication organizers seem
to have to the event.

“You see these people work-
ing day in and day out on these
shows... It leaves you with a real
sense of awe and respect,” he
said.

In “Anime in America,” Pin-
sky takes a look at the diversity
of the fans present at conven-
tions and the inspiration they
take from TV shows, video games
and other media. Despite the fact
that current American culture
usually associates animation with
children’s entertainment and car-

Dance Ensemble features student choreography

Jordan Streussnig
Staﬁ Writer

The lights dimmed, the music
started and 17 dancers seized the
stage dressed in baggy, bright-col-
ored costumes reminiscent of the

. ’8Os to dance to “Motown Philly”

by Boyz II Men.

Almost as soon as the hip-hop
crew took the stage, they were off
and replaced by another group

dancing to music from the 1996

ﬁlm “Romeo +]uliet.”

The sequence continued with
ﬂuid motion bursting with color,
new costumes, new faces and as

‘ seemingly unrelated collection of
songs that were all takenfrom mov- '

ies and performecliin chronologi-,
cal order. Titled “Cinematigraphic”
and choreographed by Pitt senior
Leah Dowdy, Friday and Saturday’s
performances included 13 pieces.

“Most of the choreography is
done by the students,” Susan Gil‘-
lis Kruman said. Kruman isfaculty
advisor of the Pitt D‘ance.Ensejmble
and coordinator of the danjceminor
program at Pitt.. _ . A }

‘Gillis said that of the 13 total

pieces, only three were choreo-
graphed by outside instructors. The
contributing choreographers were
Michelle Hall Dawson, another Pitt
faculty member, and Joe Nickel, a

A Pitt alumnus.

According to Gillis Kruman, it’s
thought that the Pitt Dance Ensem-
ble started in the 1950s and origi-
nally went by the same name as this

Jasmine Singson:

year’s spring performance, “Orche-
sis,” or “dance” in Greek. The group
accepts any and all dancers from

. Pitt who are interested in taking a.

free dance lesson from a different
genre every Tuesday night.
Jasmine Singson, member of

‘ the ensemble and performer in

this weekend’s show, said that the
weekly lesson ranges from “ballet,
jazz, and modem to Thai massage,”
which teaches partner stretching
and is used by the dancers before
shows.

Gillis Kruman added that the
club has been involved in hip-hop
and ethnic dance, as well —— in her
words, “Whatever the students

wantto do.”

« “Orchesis’f proved to be a testa-
ment tothis open attitude of the en-
semble to try anything and every-
thing related to dance. The group
performed numbers that ranged
from a tribal routine in which the

students donned browns, blacks

 

and greens to lyrical and even tap
performances. ’ A

In “Plastique,” by Kaitlin“

Weaver, students. wore solid red
and black shirts with cut—up backs
that sliced through the white
spotlight. The performers, some
of whom donned surgical masks,
danced in the foreground to music
by The Engine Room and Marilyn
Manson while other dancers in the
background took turns eerily lying
on a stainless steel table.

“It seemed like there was a lot
more of a story to this show than
other dance performances I’ve
seen,” senior Gustavo Gomez, a
member of the audience, said. “The
show was deﬁnitely entertaining,
and better than the usual ‘go out
and get a drink on asaturday night,’
because it was very cultural.’.’

Greg McCummings, a member
of the ‘dance ensemble and per-
former in “Orchesis,” said that he

‘hopes people realize how much _

hard work went into the show.
“This is something we take very
seriously,” he said. “We really love
dance.” . ‘
Performer Singson contin-

ued the thought: “A lot of things .

go on even besides the dancing,
like working on lights. We put in
so much rehearsal this past week
— we were here every night past
midnight getting our dances ready
and working on the lights  but the
rest is all fun.”

Gillis Kruman mentioned that
although all members of the ensem-
ble can participate in the weekly
scheduled classes, the rehearsals,
show preparation and choreogra-
phy all happen “on their own time,”
and so require a lot of dedication on
the part of student performers.

But to the dancers, it is worth all
of the hard work to have the chance
to explode on the stage. 

“I like performing because al-
lows you to be someone who you
may notnecessarily be in real life,”
McCummings said.

Singson added that the adrena- -

line rush that overtakes her when
she steps onto the stage is “like
nothing else you’ve ever felt.”

“I think audiences can appreci-
ate how hard the students wor ,”
said Gillis Kruman. “They look
beautiful —— the kinds of things they
do with their bodies . .. most people
couldn’t even dream about.” ,_  .

IonSound composer warns  

audience aboutzombies   

Kirstin Kennedy
For The Pitt News

urday ‘night featured an investigation of
the triangular cosmos and a public service
announcement warning of the imminent
threat of zombies, in addition to a presenta-
tion on the vinterworkings of Kafka.

The investigations came in the form of

8 music created by Christian Kriegeskotte,

Gracie Sutherland and Nathan Currier for

their ﬁnal of three concerts in the 2010-11 0’

season. -
The project is a small collaboration of

young musicians who attempt to provide

the community with concerts showcasing

, innovative genres of music. Officially ap-

pointed in 2008 as the ensemble-in—resi—
dence of the music department at Pitt, the
collective has since presented more than
80 works from modern composers.

The three composers selected this

time each had a theme throughout their’,

works.

The group playing these compositions
is comprised of six members: ﬂutist Peggy
Yoo, clarinet and bass clarinet player" Kath-
leen Costello, violinist Laura Motchalov,
cellist Elisa Kohanski, pianist/vocalist Rob
Frankenberry and percussionist Eliseo
Rael.

When the lights went up on stage at 8:05 i

p.m. in the Belleﬁeld Auditorium, about 40
people were in attendance, mostly adult
members of the community. In addition to
hearing the music of promised composers,
concert attendees witnessed the presenta-
tion of Pitt’s Graduate Student Composer
Audience Choice Award to its 2011 recipi-
ent, Jeremy Woodruff. I .

The featured composers produced their
pieces speciﬁcally for the IonSound Project
to perform in its seasonal concert series.

“The format is a little bit unusual,” Fran-
kenberry said as he introduced the ﬁrst
piece. Frankenberryserved as the make-
shift narrator of the concert.

Woodruff’s piece, titled “First Element,”
was inspired by Indian folk music and fea-
tured clips of that style of music throughout
its movements. The song consisted soley
of piano and ﬂute. Frankenberry and Yoo
performed mostly solo features through-
out the song, only playing together when
the Indian folk clips played in the back-
ground. _

After the ﬁrst piece ended, the other
four members of the project entered the
stage, and Frankenberry took the mic to
introduce the ﬁrst featured composer -
Kriegeskotte, a Carnegie Mellon gradu-
ate. The piece Kriegeskotte created for the

Ionsound Project is called “Triangulum,”
in reference to the small constellation in
the Northern sky named for its triangular

_ - shape.
The IonSound Project performance on Sat- '

M 5‘I have this notion that the universe is
held by music,” Kriegeskotte said. 7‘So this
is a series that has no narrative content.”

The work is intended to “remove the ‘

listener from the relative security of the
inner Universe to the cold outer edge of the
visible cosmos,” Kriegeskotte wrote in his
notes provided in the event’s program.
After the performance of “Triangulum,”
Frankenberry called Duqueéne graduate
Gracie Sutherland, the second feature com-
poser, to the stage tointroduce her piece
“Overture to a ZombieApocalypse.” Suther-
land is new to the composing world, but at
23 she has already produced several musi-
cal pieces. In'her introduction, she called

her three-movement work a sort of public

service announcement explaining the po-
tential dangers of a zombie takeover.
“You should really be afraid of zombies,”
Sutherland said in introducing her piece.
Like a zombie-comedy, the tone of the
songs went from low tohesthat sounded
very dark to upbeat, lighter rhythms.

“I focus on rhythm and chromatic har- ,

mony,” she said.

The ﬁnal composer, juilliard graduate
Nathan Currier, presented a musically com-
plex narrative piece that parodied Bach’s
“Coffee Cantata.” The story he tells is one
of a young girl reading Kafka and her disap-
proving father’s reaction.

The piece contained 12 different move-
ments, alternating between dramatic
readings and music. -Currier, who was not
present for the performance, provided a
detailed explanation of his story in the
program. The piece became a theatrical
performance as Frankenberry added dra-
matic vocals and facial expressions.

“It’s pretty dense,” said audience mem-
ber Elliot Beck, in his ﬁrst year of a perfor-
mance residency fellowshipat Carnegie
Mellon. “It was a piece that you needed
focus and understanding of the writing.
You couldn’t just get an impression from
one listening.”

The concert also featured two guest art-
ists, viola player Jonathan Moser, a Pitts-
burgh ‘freelancer, and pianistjack Kurutz,
a recitalist and chamber musician.

The ending of the piece brought all of
the musicians together and concluded with
a triumphant tone, having been through
constellations, zombie attacks and a parody
of Kafka. '

“It’s a good medium to tell a story,”
said Randy Tobias, a Pitt senior and video

‘ program organizer for the convention.

“People in all parts‘-of the .world love a
good story.” And beyond admirationfor
those stories, many attendees wanted to
truly embody their characters.

From Sailor Moon to Cloud of “Final
Fantasy VII” to Solid Snake of “Metal Gear
Solid,” most of the people who bustled
through the hotel engaged in cosplay——
dressing up as their favorite characters
for competition, tribute or just fun.

“I describe [the convention] to some
people who don’t know anything about
anime as a three- or four—day Halloween,”
said Tobias, who at the time was wearing
a volunteer shirt. “I-t’s a bunch of people
in costumes having fun.”

Walking down the hallways of the

costume designed to look like a popular
but misunderstood Internet character,

that,” Fellman said. “I just decided, ‘Why
not?”’

Simultaneously a tribute to Japanese .

the Internet, the anthropomorphic bear is
notorious in this highly connected com-
munity. - N

“I get attention,” Fellman said. “I got
pictures  hugs. I’m not hardcore into
anime  I’m here because it’s fun.”

That fun manifests itself in other way
as well. i

“I like to get together with people who
have panels on stuff I’ve taken an interest
in,” said Nick Yoos, president of Pitt’s

what’s happening in a series or what might '

happen. ‘Where are they going with the

“Personally, I think it’s amazing that
we got Steve Blum here,” Tobias said “He’s

Pittsburgh’s arena football team, the Power, fell to Tulsa 45-22 at the Consol Energy Center on Saturday.

Q&A

Roth writes of
journey ‘From

PA to LA’

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

In his autobiography “From PA
to LA,” former Pitt football play-
er Yogi Roth reflects on his fam-
ily, his friends, his career as a
Panther and his trips across the
globe as a nomadic 2o—some-
thing — from the West Bank to
the Fijian jungle to Southern
Chile.

Ten years ago, Roth walked
onto the Pitt football team as
a wide receiver as a freshman.
He earned a full scholarship
after his sophomore season.
After graduation, he moved to
Los Angeles to coach at the Uni-
versity of Southern California
under Pete Carroll -—- a move
that inspired the title for his
book. _

Today, Roth, 29, works for
ESPN as an analyst and the host
of the Elite 11 Quarterback Com-
petition, a national contest for
prep athletes that evaluates
more than 1,000 quarterbacks.
He has also appeared in Com-
edy Centra1’s “The Onion Sports
Network” and travels the coun-
try to speak at universities.

The Pitt News recently spoke
with Roth about his family, his
book, his career at Pitt and why
he walked away from coach-
ing. *

The Pitt News: In your book,
you talk a lot about your heri-
tage and your family, even in-
cluding the e—mails you sent to
your younger brother when you
coached at USC. Could you see
yourself where you are today
without the support from your
family?

Yogi Roth: Not a chance. It
was huge. It started with them.
Growing up in a family with
Holocaust survivors, you real-
ize what true competition was.

I’ll never forget it. When you
start to have some success as
an athlete, to me it was never
that big a deal.‘I was Pennsylva-
nia’s player of the year [in high
school], which was awesome,
but my first thought was, “There
are 49 other states, and there’s a
lot of other stuff going on in the
world.” I’m a reflection of the
community I grew up in.

TPN: You’re now working for
ESPN and you did some work
with The Onion, which I’ll admit
sounds like the coolest job ever.
The book leaves off at USC. Are
you enjoying your new line of
work?

YR: It’s a blast. I know I’m re-
ally fortunate. Whatever your
vision is, if you chase it and
truly believe it’s what you want
to do, you’ll accomplish it. That
doesn’t mean, “I want to be a
millionaire so I’m going to be a
millionaire,” but when you set
out a vision, there’s nothing you
can’t do. When I left coaching,
I left it because, first, I didn’t
want to leave Los Angeles. I’m

really lucky that I’m acting and "

falling into a couple roles. It’s
not about being on ESPN. It’s
about the performance of it.
The drive to perform is what I
need. In acting and in hosting
and calling games, I get [to see]
more than 12 games a year.

TPN: Have you thought about
going back to coaching?

)4

YR: I almost went back —— I *

had a chance to go to a couple
schools or the NFL, but I didn’t
do it. I get to do the Elite 11
show, where we go around
the country, evaluate the top
[high school] quarterbacks and
choose the top 11 kids to come
to LA. When we do the show, I’m
not the host necessarily. I get to

New Madden game features concussion rules

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

Peter Moore, the president of EA Sports,
recently joined the anti-concussion NFL
campaign by announcing that his gaming
company will make some changes in its
premier football video game Madden.

The new settings for Madden NFL 12
will prevent players from re—entering
games after suffering a concussion. When
concussion safety issues extend to virtual
players, things are starting to get a little
ridiculous.

There will be no more picking Michael
Vick in the sixth round of your fantasy
draft just so you can‘ run a five wideout
quarterback sneak 80 times a game and

= then bring him back in even if he gets hurt.

Now if Vick goes down with a concussion,
he’s done.

It’s “wrong” for the game to allow con-
cussed players to return to the ﬁeld in the
following quarter, Moore said at the World
Congress of Sports in Miami.

As another part of the effort, the game’s
announcers, Gusjohnson and Cris Collins-
worth, will discuss the dangers of concus-
sions when a player is sent to the bench
with a head injury.

mental health -‘ﬁlill vice vers

The game’s namesake, John Madden,
came out in support of Moore’s deci-
sion.

“Concussions are such a big thing, it
has to be a big thing in the video game,”
Madden told The New York Times in a tele-
phone interview. “It starts with young kids
— they start in video games. I think the
osmosis is if you get a concussion, that’s,a
serious thing and you shouldn’t play... We
want that message to be strong,”

Who does EA Sports really think they
are helping? What’s next EA? ,

Are you going to take all of your Fight
Night Champion games off the shelves
because they teache kids to throw a nice
left hook?

' Are you going to disallow turning pen-
alties off in NHL 2012 so I can’t send Alex
Ovechkin through the glass every time he
tries to clear the puck‘?

Will there be no blood in this year’s EA
Sports MMA video game?

These changes to Madden NFL 12 are
about as pointless as watching “Jersey
Shore” to see if Sammi and Ronnie’s ar-
gument that night is ﬁnally going to end
things. 2

GYMNASTICS

Two Panthers compete at NCAA
Regional Championships

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt gymnasts Alyssa Adrian and Molly Moyer
competed in the NCAA Regional Champion-
ship at the University of Michigan on Sat-
urday.

Being selected for the tournament shows
that Adrian and Moyer are among the re-
gion’s best individual gymnasts. Each year, the

NCAA sends qualifying teams, ﬁve all-around

competitors on non—qualifying teams and

one gymnast for each of the four events to

compete as specialists in the tournament.
Adrian and Moyer were both selected as

’ event specialists for the Ann Arbor region-

al.

It was the second NCAA Regional for Moy-
er, a senior. Competing on the vault, Moyer put
up a 9.7 score out of 10 to ﬁnish in 35th place
out of 42 competitors.]oanna Sampson from
Michigan took ﬁrst with a score of 9.9.

As a freshman in 2008, Moyer competed
in the regional on the ﬂoor.

This year, she came in 24th on the vault at
the East Atlantic Gymnastics League Champi-
onships with a score of 9.750. Moyer ﬁnished

with a 9.691 season average and set a career-
high 9.850 score on the vault.

Competing in her ﬁrst NCAA Regional
Championship, Adrian scored a 9.6 on the
uneven bars to ﬁnish in 31st place out of 42.
Another Michigan athlete, Jordan Sexton,
ﬁnished ﬁrst with a score of 9.9.

Earlier this season, Adrian earned All-
EAGL second-team honors after scoring a
9.525 at the EAGL Championships.

The top two teams, Michigan and Kent
State, and all-around competitors at the NCAA
Regional Championship advanced to the Na—
tional Championships in Cleveland, Ohio.

As a team, the Panthers wrapped up their
season with a seventh place ﬁnish on March
19 at the EAGL Championships.

Prior to the EAGL Championships, three
athletes earned All—EAGL ﬁrst or second-team
honors. Adrian represented on the second-
team, while Alicia Talucci and Lisa Taylor
were both selected for the ﬁrst—team on bal-
ance beam. V

Talucci, a junior, has earned ﬁrst—team
honors on the beam for three consecutive
years. Adrian and Taylor both earned an All-
EAGL selection for the ﬁrst time. I

can see clean hits. If people are playing
Madden to learn good tackling form, they
probably won’t be making a football team
anytime soon.

I play Madden because I’m a Redskins

° fan, and since they won’t win another game

in my lifetime, I can at leastfeel a little bit
better when I’m destroying, the Packers
72?3, Donovan McNabb, has 800 passing
yards and Clinton Portis can still find the
end zone- '

But most of all, I play Madden for that
special moment when I can unleash that
hit stick on my roommate right when he’s
on theverge of thinking he might ﬁnally
bring down the champion —— that’s me.

If Madden and Moore really believe that
they are making some noble movement to
change the mindset of kids, they should
take a step back and look at how sports
video games really affect people.

Realistically, Madden NFL 12 will be
played by three groups of people: the sport
junkies that love to finish their night with
some football video games, the gamers

fun than getting real exercise.

If Madden and Moore want to teach
kids» about the proper tackling form,
maybe they should take their 2012 game

off the shelves completely and encour— '

age kids to spend a year outside actually
playing football or trying out for their
schools’ teams.

With the looming NFL strike, this could
be the best year to encourage kids to try
the game of football away from their tele-
vision screens.

The saddest part of the ordeal is that
this decision will receive praise and sup-
portfrom players’ unions and NFL own-
ers alike. It’s just one more reminder of

everyone’s constant self-interest and the '
growing divide between players, owner-

ship and fans that is reaching an all—time
high.

So if players can’t hit each other in real ‘

life, can’t get hurt in the video games and

can’t even settle for multi—million dollar '

contracts and refuse to put a team on the
field, what exactly are we paying these

, guys for? =

question, you can find me in’ front of my
