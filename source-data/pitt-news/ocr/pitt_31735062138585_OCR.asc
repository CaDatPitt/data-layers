“These kids are wonderful. They work hard and ﬁght
hard and can do just about anything they want to do. They
are the most spirited group I’ve had since 1931. Why, I don’t
have to inspire them. They inspire me.” .

. It was Dr. Carlson describing his current basketball ag-
gregation. And while the Doctor’s optimism has always been
such as to place him in disfavor with the Coaches Union where
moaning is a highly developed art and it is considered sacrilege
if not treason ever to concede anything but the worst, it might
ﬁe gathered that this year's Little Toughies have some-
, mg.

It is evident from the roster, however, that the “some-
thing" has little to do with either size or experience. The
tallest member of the probable starting lineup is 6’ 2” Ken
Vey. And only Captain Walter Jones was a member of ‘last
year’s squad. Bill Cieply and Tom Ragan were members of
last year's freshman basketball team. Sophomore Nate Apple
was in school last year but did not play. Wally Zernich, whose
brother Steve was a Rinky-Dink last year, is a freshman.

Since last year’s team which the Doctor once declared was
composed of “two ballplayers, eight expendables, and two non-
essentials" won ten games and lost only ﬁve, comparisons
seem in order. _

‘ The Pitt basketball mentor insists thatthe current team
is as good if not better, despite the loss of co-captains Bob Art-
man and Tay Malarkey. “They may not have the stamina to
last a full forty minutes, but they will be as well grounded
in the technics of basketball as any team, and they can’t be
beaten whenit comes to ﬁght or spirit”, he says.

And Captain Walt Jones concurrs with the Doctor. “I've
never seen a team like this,” he enthuses, “With everyone
working together and everyone helping everyone else.”

Of course, proof of how well the Carlson Kids work to-
gether will be shown in relation.to how well they work against
the Violets of New York University one week from Tuesday.
But whatever the outcome of the game, it is certain that

the Little Toughies will put on a good show. In fact, it is re- -

liably reported that if the action in the basketball game gets
too dull, two of the boys will put on a shadow boxing act at
one end of the court while the remaining three toss the ball
around on the other end. ‘i -
The “boxing act” which is the Doctor’s 1943-44 contribu-
tion to basketball, was doubtless inspired by the Madison
-Square Garden locale of the first game, since boxing and Pro-
moter Tex Rickard made the Gardens. However, the game is
likely to be interrupted by the rumbling of the late Tex turn-

_ ing over in his grave at the thought of the fans getting some-

"thing "for ' nothing.
The team is taking Dr. Carlson’s “Win ’Em All” slogan
‘ pretty seriously this year. There are signs plastered all over
the dressing room and the Doctor even had special ones printed
for the boys to take home with them. The theme is always
the same, but there are some variations. One sign, displaying
the southern inﬂuence, possibly the result of the Doctor’s con-
acts with the air cadets, many of whom hail from south of
he Mason-Dixon Line, reads “We ALL Win ’Em All”. An-
other more fanciful one reads “We ALWAYS Win ’Em All”.
All things considered, we wouldn’t be too surprised if the
Little Toughies actually talked themselves into “winning ’em

N YU, Wellstminster On
Holiday‘ Week Card

By HUGH CHAVERN

Doc Carlson’s worries all point toward New York Uni-
versity as the Tiny Toughies prepare to meet the NYU basket-
ball squad in the Panther’s initial game of the season in Madi-
son Square Garden on December 28. Several games of the NYU
schedule already have been played, and the Violet squad has

Cage

taken them all in stride so far. The<->7

scores have been slightly on the
astronomical side, promising a very
interesting game. The Panther prac-
tice games so far this year have
seen some fairly high scores, prov-
ing thesworth of the new “sausage”
offense invented by Coach Carlson.

The second game, also to be
played during the student holiday,
will be with. Westminster College at
Farrell, Pa., December 31., The Ti-
tans defeated Carnegie Tech," Pi_tt’s,
third opponent, last week by a very
close margin, 38-37, and almost
were on the short end. The record of
Tech losses therefore would not
seem to indicate too tough a match

forthe Panthers on January 5.

' ‘fWe’re still _.not worried,” said
Doctor Carlson. “We are having
trouble getting practice opponents,
but we won't let that get us down.
The boys have the spirit, and they
really want to play. Steve Zernich

and Nate Apple are going to be el-
igible for the draft soon, but that
doesn’t‘worry us. We are still going
to ‘Win ’Em All’.’'

Scarcity of opponents takes a lit-
tle edge out of the Panther’s bite
but the first squad is working out
against the second and third strings.
J. W. Glenn, one of the varsity’s
main hopes for the coming year, has
dropped the team due to a heavy
schedule. He also suffered a leg in-
jury at the very! beginning of the
practice workouts.

There was a possibility of a prac-
tice game this afternoon but the op-
posing team has not yet been an-
nounced. Army teams at Pitt, both
Air Crew and Specialized Training
outﬁts, are having a difﬁcult time
ﬁnding enough free hours to sched-
ule practice contests, as are the
Army teams at Tech who have been
contacted to ﬁnd possible opponents.
