you’re over 30. _ I ‘
Kenda Post, 31, is a senior studying reha-

P bilitation science at Pitt. She is among a group

of undergraduates who are considered “non—
traditional students.” Because she delayed
going to college until later in life, Post is older
than “traditional” students, or students who
are between 18 and 22 years old. i

A student is considered nontraditional if —

he or she is ﬁnancially independent, supports ‘

a family or is a single parent, works fu]l~time, :

or attends school part—time or does not have V
a high school diploma. _ P . .
Accordingto the National Center for Edu-

P * cation Statistics, two—thirds of students in col-

leges in the United States are nontraditional,
and such students have been the majority since

Representatives from the University were
unable to provide statistics regardingthe num-

Post worked as a teaching assistant in New
York state at various schools throughout her
twenties.

She then decided to move to Pittsburgh
with a former boyfriend. She said her class-
mates olten don’t realize she is older, but
sometimes having more life experience than
her classmates is frustrating.

“Something that seems really basic to

someone in my position gets explained to us
like 14times,” Post said, “like how to apply for
a job, mock interviews and resumés.”

Attending class full-time, working eve-
nings and weekends and commuting from
Mt. Oliver, Pa., doesn’t leave Post much free
time. She said her tight schedule can be an
issue when professors expect students to at-
tend events outside of class.

“Forty—ﬁve hours of volunteer work was a
huge chunk of our grade [for a class] ,” she said
about her Introduction to Social Work class
last year. “I can’t stop going to my paid job to

Lawton said it is nearly impossible for him
to ﬁnd a j ob that is “career relevant” while he

been unrelated to accounting.

Time constraints also present problems
for students with children who may not be
able to ﬁnd affordable childcare, according
to Mary Beth McCulloch, director ofthe Uni-
versity Child Development Center on Clyde
Street. Though the center is available for use
,by undergraduate parents, McCulloch said

1 graduate students with children use their

services much more often. 1

“Whatever reason that you’re here or what-
ever reason that your child is here, our biggest
job is to make sure that the children are safe
and learning and growing so the parents can
go on campus and do whatever they need to
do,’.’ McCulloch said.

The center is open to children of faculty,
staff and students, and payment is based on
the family’s total household income and the

age of the child. According to McCulloch, as

family could fall into six different payment
categories, and subsidies are available to those
at certain income levels.

“I would want to know what he does
for the people of Pennsylvania,” she said.

In his campaigning efforts,-Koplinski is
making a statewide tour to clear up some
oifthelconfusion. Koplinski, ‘44, is part of
a pool of six declared candidates seeking
the Democratic Party’s nomination for

V lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.

The-primary election, slated for May
20,‘will determine the gubernatorial and

lieutenant gubernatorial candidates. Once .

elected, both candidates will campaign
together until the Nov. 4 general elections.
‘ Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor has

- . six primary responsibilities. The lieuten-

ant governor heads the state senate and
acts as governor, if need be, according to
Koplinski. Additionally, the lieutenant
governor works‘ closely with the governor
on other projects based on priority level.

- Koplinski said thelieutenant governor
heads Pennsylvania’s Board of Pardons
and Emergency Management Agency, as
well as the Marcellus Shale Advisory Com-
mission, which works to address issues

-regarding the production of American

natural gas. _
Those who work alongside the lieuten-
ant governor say their role iscrucial in
state policymaking. V

Tom Corbett’s re—election campaign, said
Pennsylvania’s current lieutenant»gover—
nor, Jim Cawley, works very closely with

Koplinski says he can excel at this por-
tion of thejob because of his experience
as a Harrisburg city councilman.

V as part of a move” to gain endorsements

and; meet with various local political-ac-
tivist groups, Koplinski said bridging gaps

between Pennsylvania’s municipalities is

one of his primary, goals. ‘
’ “Unless you’re Philadelphia and to

some extent, Pittsburgh,A[Harrisburg] V

r

is not listening,” Koplinski said.

But before he can implement any‘

changes, Koplinski has to win the ballot.

According to Koplinski’s campaign di-
rector,‘ Matthew Pianka, candidates run-
ning for lieutenant governor can declare

collect at least 1,000 petition signatures

- with 100 of the signatures spread over

‘’ five different counties to be considered

an official nominee.

Pianka said it’s too soon to tell how »

they promised to do in the campaign,” _

he said. .

They’re also tasked with maintaining
ties between the state and local govern-
ments. _ -

9 Jeff Varner, special assistant to incum-
bent Lt. Gov. Jim Cawley, said the lieuten-
ant governor heads the governor’s Local
Government Advisory Committee, where
local government representatives from
across the state come together to ﬁnd

so far, but he expects Koplinski will have

' more than 2,500 signatures by the end

of next week.

To make Pennsylvanians aware of
his. mission, Koplinski has visited all 67
counties in the state to “get a handle on
what people are thinking.” He said guber-

natorial candidates have the money for —

television advertisements, which reach
a large audience, to garner votes. Lack-
ing these resources, Koplinski is relying

on personal relationships to become a

contender.

,“We have to make sure we build the
base statewide,” Koplinski said. “Right
now, I talk tomayors everywhere and ﬁnd
out theirneeds and concerns.” ,

Koplinski said he is looking forward to
working -with any of the Democratic Par-
ty’s nominated gubernatorial candidates
and to helping them achieve their goals.

“I’m very pleased that we’ve got an
extremely strong group of people running
for governor,” he said. “We see a real op-
portunity here.” I

Active A consumption of information reverses trends of misinformation

Channing Kaiser
Columnist ‘

“Be the change you wish to.see in the
world,” Mahatma Gandhi once said.

Oh, wait. Scratch that. He never

actually said it.
 This is one of the many popular
misquotations that is smacked onto
bumper stickers, mugspand pictures
of sunsets or white—sand beaches. It’s
supposed to be inspirational. It’s sup-
posed to be optimistic and cheery. It’s
supposed to speak to your soul and
motivate you to achieve goals you’ve
only ever dreamed about.

The real quote wouldn’t fit nicely
onto a bumper sticker: “If we could
change ourselves, the tendencies in
the world would also change. As a man

\

changes his own nature, so does the
attitude of the world change towards
him.  We need not wait to see what
others do.” A
Doesn’t'have the same peppy ring
to it, now does it? - .-_ e -
Our generation is used to consum-
ing information quickly. If a webpage
doesn’t load within a minute, we_’re
probably going to find something else
to do or read. Patience — especially
with electronics —— is not a virtue we
possess. So it’s no surprise that instead
of sitting down with “Walden” and see-
ing if Henry David Thoreau actually
said, “Go conﬁdently in the direction
of your dreams. Live the life you’ve
imagined”‘(spoiler alert: he didn’t);
we’d rather read Sparknotes, buy the
motivational mug and say we dabbled

in Thoreau in school, but still prefer
Ralph Waldo Emerson (whom you

probably also didn’t read). ‘
But by ignoring the original text,

we’re losing nuances of the writers’

‘work and sometimes missing their

points entirely. Forexample, “Romeo,

Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?”

is a quotation many Americans could
recite, only most wouldn’t know that
“wherefore” does not mean “where,”
but “why,” and that Juliet isn’t asking
for Romeo’s location, but something
much deeper. .

Because of the Internet’s dubious
credibility regarding quotes and facts,
deliberate misquotations have become
a trend. for an example, look at the blog
“Incorrect Sylvia Plath-Quotes,” which
features gems such as “Whatever, I’m

getting cheese fries”'and “How can

hip-hop be dead if Wu—Tang is forever?”
As an exaggeration,‘it’s funny.—But
when you realize that some people
don’t'even know who Plath is and
are only reblogging the post because
they’re die-hard Wu—Tang Clan fans,
then it becomesaproblematic. ,
As a person deeply invested in lit-
erature, it saddens me that great works
are being cheapened into catchphrases
andtbubbly quotes, their artistic nu-
ances cast aside. But on a deeper level,
[find it problematic that_we don’t ques-

tion these supposed facts. We accept

that Marilyn Monroe said, “Well-be-
haved women rarely make history,”

’(she didn’t, it was a Harvard professor)

or that, “Nice guys finish last,” (the
original quote says that they finish
seventh) without double—checking our
facts. V A V
It’s not a big deal if your senior
quote was more of a paraphrase than an
actual quote, but our lack of skepticism
has larger ramiﬁcations. Critical read-
ing is a skill that we need to bring not

only to literature, but to other facets
of our life, as well. Take, for example,
speeches from our politicians and our
newspapers. We can’t trust everything
they say or report at face value, and it’s
up to us to get the facts for ourselves.

For example, one trending video
right now is titled, “The five awkward
times experts shut down news an-
chors by being experts,” because they
were either ﬂat-out wrong or asking
misleading questions. It’s amusing to
watch the news anchors — all of whom

work for Fox News — try to regain their
footing, but you have to ask yourself:
What kind of information are we get-
ting when these experts aren’t around?

We need to question where we get
our facts, both in terms of literature
and in the broader spectrum, and one
of_the best ways to do this is to go
straight to the source. Once you start
reading, you’ll discover that although

blood is thicker than water, the quote ‘

refers to blood shed on the battlefield
and water from the,womb, and you’ll

learn exactly which promises Obama
made and didn’t keep.

Perhaps my favorite political quote
of all comes from the tea party. In re-
gard to the endangered species debacle
that took place in Florida, Colorado
Rep. Michael Coffman said, “Today
we can’t ride a manatee, tomorrow we
won’t be able to open our own busi—
ness.” Don’t believe me? Check it out
for yourself. I_

Sounds like: a national

millions of people
crying in unison 
you get the ‘point

Mark Kozelek’s stunning new release as Sun
 Moon, “Benji,” isn’t much of an album. It’s
a collection of short storieswith living, breath-
ing characters. Unless, of course, they’ve been
stricken by heartbreaking tragedy, like many
ofthesubjects Kozelek portrays.

Benji doesn’t particularly sound like a
revelation —— at least on the surface. Kozelek
still specializes in a_ sparse and raw, yet subtly
gorgeous folk sound, with occasional forays
into the upbeat (“Ben’s My Friend”) or the

Moon’smorose new album

  

‘Sim Kii Moon’s new record’ isvliragic, distantaml stunningiy beautiful.

" tor_1gue—in-cheek ode to “dad rock’ (‘‘I Love

My Dad”). These songs could have felt right
at home on any of Sun _Kil Moon’s previous

. records — until you listen to the lyrics.

‘ Though his last record, 2o12’s “Among
The Leaves,” may not have been Kozelek’s
best, it might have informed Benji as much
as any of his past works in terms of pure vo-
cal delivery. On “Leaves,” Kozelek employed
a rapid-ﬁre and painﬁilly honest stream of
consciousness. Packing as many thoughts
into a bar as R. Kelly did on “Trapped in the
Closet,” he left no detail off the table. This is
the case with Benji -— albeit through a far
more tragic and sobering lens. This is not
meant to be easy listening.

A lot of people die on Benji. Whether they
die froman exploding aerosol can, a gunshot

tude of the Steel City, as well as regional land
issues and an alarming lack of responsibility.
The land that composes the Allegheny
Landing area is owned by the city, but the
sculptures are owned by the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art. When the parkwas ﬁrst built, it
was Mellon Stuart Construction who prom-
ised to maintain the park and the sculptures.
Snyder explained that the Pittsburgh Foun-
dation “set up a public art fund to main-
tain the sculptures, with $30,000 given by
A the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Bu
$30,000 wasn’t enough.” p ’
Making matters worse, Mellon Stuart,
which had built two buildings for their com-
pany on the North Shore and who saw the art
park as away to help create aublic-friendly
landscape, then went out of business and left
Pittsburgh. After the company left, there
was no caretaker for the city to call on to
help maintain the landing. Even though the
Carnegie Museum of Art owned the sculp-
tures and the city owned the property, the
park slowly fell into disrepair once the ﬁ1nd-

ing provided by the Urban Redevelopment ’

Authority ran out. Accordinglto Snyder, plan
at the time was to form a new committee
to raise additional money, but this_never
happened..- V

With this in mind, exactly why the park '

failed is the subject of debate, much of which
according to many involved slides into top-
ics of money, identity and unwillingness to

change, and that also dips muddy ﬁngers’

intothe political sphere.
Pittsburgh’s heritage — built on steel and
‘the sweat of workers — is an identity that
some believe grounds the sort of stagnant
attitude toward public art in the city.

 

Sophomore history of art and architec-
ture student Meghan l'-‘Iipple wrote her cap-
stone paper about Smyth’s “Piazza Lavoro”
sculpture. Hipple is from a town 45 minutes

outside of Pittsburgh and has grown up with._

the image of Pittsburgh as a “Steel City.”
While researching her paper, she found that
this mindset is widespread.

“People still have the mentality that we
are a ‘Steel City":.. But we are not a ‘Steel
City’ anymore.  This is not who Pittsburgh

«is anymore. Pittsburgh still perceives itself
. as a ‘great industrial city’ but doesn’t real-

ize how art is very important to a city. Art
is a big tourist and money factor, and cities
get money from the federal government for
having public art. It’s a bigger beneﬁt than
just being pretty,” she said. .

Snyder said another issue is the simple

fact that people don’t know about the history
V. behind public art suchfas that’ in Allegheny

Landing. ,

“A- lot of the problem is the lack of edu-
cation about public art and the city. A lot of
people pass public art every day and don’t
think twice about it,.because they don’t know
anything about it,” she said. _

While there has been a history of neglect
of public art in Pittsburgh, there has also
been a recent renewal of interest in these
works. Friends of Allegheny Landing, with
the aid of the Carnegie Museum of Art and
other groups, has begun raising ﬁmds to
clean up Allegheny Landing, a process that
involves landscape alterations and preser-
vation work to be done on the sculptures.

Public art is not dead in Pittsburgh, and
these kinds of initiatives show an increasing

‘recognition of its importance to the city.

According to Laura Zorch, an educational
programs assistant with the city’s Office of
Public Art, “Art is playing an interesting role
in how the city is reshaping and re-identi-
fying itself after the industry is gone. It is
changing, showing we may no longer be a
steel town, but here is what else we have to

' offer,” shesaid.

This new line of thinking shows that art
and the image of a “Steel City” do not neces-

. sarily have to be separated for Pittsburgh to

clean up its image.

“One of the newer sculptures on the South
Side called “The Workers” depicts two giant
steel workers made with reclaimed beams,”
Zorch said. “It is a giant piece of public art
that reﬂects on [Pittsburgh’s] industrial past
and that is representative of the steel heri-
tage that once existed here.” I V

The Pittsburgh Panthers traveled
to Chestnut Hill, Mass., Wednesday
needing a victory to end their three-

game losing streak with four games re?

maining in the‘ season and their NCAA
Tournament hopes, possibly fading.
Against Boston College, the Atlantic

A Coast Conference’s last-place team,
‘ the Panthers left Silvio ‘O. Conte Forum

with a seven‘-point win behind superb
performancesby seniors Talib Zanna
and Lamar Patterson.

Zanna scored. 21 points and pulled
down six rebounds while Patterson
scored 16 to get the Panthers (21-7, 9-6
ACC) back on track with a. 66-59 vic-
tory at Boston College (7-21, 3-12 ACC).

The night was a historic one for the '
-redshirt senior center from Kaduna,

Nigeria, as he reached the 1,000-point
plateau in the final minute when he
made a free throw with 15 -secondsto
play. A

Olivier Hanlan scored 25 points on
10-of-15 shooting "to lead Boston Col-
lege, his 10th game this year scoring

20 or more. Patrick Heckmann scored
15 points, while Ryan Anderson posted
ololpoints and five rebounds.

Boston College got off to a quick
start in the first two minutes of the

game thanks to three Pitt turnovers V

and led_ 7-2fwith 17:44 to play in the
first half. Pitt’s issues taking care of
the ball plagued thePanthers through-
out the game as 17 of their turnovers
resulted in 22 Boston College points.
Pitt then used a 17-4 run to take a

p 19-11 lead minutes later after eight

early points from Patterson. The Pan-
thers extended their advantage to as
much as 15 points in the firsthalf with
a 12-0 run and another 7-0 spurt.’

V Pitt’s major advantage in the first
half came on the boards, as the team
voutrebounded the Eagles 16-7 inthe
game’s first 20 minutes. Pitt dominated
the offensive glass, as the Panthers

pulled down nine rebounds after their

own missed shots, which out—num-

bine earlier this week, NFL Network
analyst Mike Mayock called Savage a
“wild card that nobody talks about” at
the quarterback position.

“He’s a big, strong kid that can

throw,” Mayock said. ‘

Savage did not rank among the top
quarterback performers at the com-
bine, participating in the 40-yard dash,
verticaljump, broadjump, three-cone
drill and 20-yard shuttle drills.

But despite Savage’s numbers in the T

‘drills, Street tweeted Monday: “Even
though it wasn’t on TV, Tom Savage
was the best QB. Every wideout gave
him praise! So underrated.”

CBS Sports ranks the . 6—foot—4,
228-pound signal-caller as the No. 12
quarterback prospect in the class and
projects him to be drafted in the sixth
or seventh round.

Nawrocki writes that Savage has
“terriﬁc size” and has “excellent arm
strength to complete NFL throws,” but
also notes that he “forces some throws”
and “tends to stare’down his target.”

But Hanlan kept his team from be-

ing blown out in the frame by scor— _

ing 14 points in the first half. Hanlan
made a pair of mid-range jumpers and
a 3—pointer on the Eagles’ ﬁnal posses-
sion of the half to bring Boston College
within nine points, 35-26. V ,

Aside from Hanlan, the rest of the
Eagles on the floor scored 12 points on
5-of-14 (35.7 percent) shooting. The
sophomore guard’s shot—making abil-
ity (6-of—9) pulledhis team up to 47.8
percent for the frame.

Opposite Hanlan, the Panthers built .

their lead with a balanced attack. Talib.
Zanna scored nine points, Patterson
and Cameron Wright each scored eight
and Jamel Artis added seven off the
bench. The Panthers collectively shot
14—of-26 (53.8 percent) in the first half.

Patterson had one of his better

shooting nights, after heentered the
contest having shot just 31 percent

from the field in his previous seven

games. But the redshirt senior from
Lancaster, Pa., knocked down four of
seven 3-point attempts and shot 5—of—12
(41.6 percent) from the field overall.

Out of the halftime break", Pitt
quickly extended the lead back to dou-
ble digits when Michael Young made
a layup and Patterson nailed a triple
on the next trip down to go up 40-26.

The Eagles then outscored the Pan-
thers 19-9 over the next 10 minutes ——
which included an 8-0 Boston College
run —— to pull within four points after

Hanlan made a pair of free throws with.

8:51 to play. .
Fromthere, the Panthers controlled

Pitt hosts No. 13 N.C. State in final home game

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

It’s quickly becoming lonely at the bottom of
the Atlantic Coast Conference ‘standings’ for
the Pitt women’s basketball team. '

Following losses to then-last-place Virginia
Tech last Thursday and to Syracuse Sunday,
the Panthers (11-17, 3-11 ACC) are close to a
last-place league ﬁnish for the third year in a
row with just two games remaining.

No. 13 North Carolina State visits the Pe-

- tersen Events Center tonight, with a chance -

to make history —— a win in Pittsburgh would
mark the program’s 800th. Only 28 other
Division I women’s basketball programs have
reached that plateau.

The Wolfpack (23—5, 10-4 ACC) is currently
tied for third inthe conference standings but

      

has lost two of its last three games after falling
to No. 7 Duke on the road and No. 17 North
Carolina at home.

The team has also struggled to defeat

- lower-tier opponents recently.

The Wolfpack was able to avoid an upset

' againstVirginia(13-14, 6-8 ACC) Sundaywith

a 68-66 home win. N.C. State needed a 9-0
run at the end of the game to overcome the
Cavaliers’ late lead, and the spurt was capped

by a 3-pointer by Kody Burke with 11 seconds '

left in the game.

In thetwo games priorto the losses against
the Blue Devils and Tar Heels, N.C. State
needed overtime periods to win at Virginia
Tech (13-14, 3-11 ACC) and Clemson (12-17,
4-11 ACC).

As for the Panthers, they continue to reel

through another difﬁeult conference sched-

February — a‘56-43 home win against Clem-
son Feb. 16 —— and lost 10 of its last 12 games
in head coach Suzie McConnell-Serio’s ﬁrst
year leading the squad.

Brianna Kiesel leads the Panthers from

the point guard positionwith 16.6 points per in

game. She is also the team’s second—leading
rebounder, pulling down 5.1 boards per game.

Forward Asia Logan is the only other Pan-
ther averaging double-digit scoringwith 11.6
points per game and leads the team in re-
bounding with 6.5 per game.

For N.C. State, the Wolfpack features a pair
of proliﬁc senior scorers in the post that will
pose matchup problems for the undersized
Panthers. '

6-foot-5 senior Markeisha Gatling anchors
the Wolipack at center and leads the team in

scoring and rebounding with 17.3 points andam
seven_ rebounds per game. Offensively, Gatling
has been a force on the interior, shooting a
conference—best 67.8 percent from the ﬁeld
this season.

Gatling is ﬂanked by 6-foot—4 redshirt
senior forward/center Lakeesa Daniel, whciﬁ
is second to her teammate in each category,
scoring 15.3 points and pulling down 6.3 re-
bounds per game..Daniel also spreads the
ﬂoor from her position, as she ranks second
on the team with 33 made 3-pointers.

On the perimeter, senior guard Myisha
Goodwin-Coleman is one of the premier
threats from long-range, as she leads the
team with 77 3-pointers made this season.
