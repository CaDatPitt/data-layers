University faculty vote against unionization

By Jenifer Crook
suqr Writer

Despite the United Faculty’s eight-year
court battle to secure the right to uriionize,
University of Pittsburgh faculty members
voted overwhelmingly against collective
bargaining.

Last Friday officials from the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board hand-
counted the 2,138 votes received from Pitt
faculty members and librarians since the

City Council urges Pitt
to release crime reports

By Stacey Jakubowski

City council member Jim Ferlo A

union vote began on Feb. 15. According to
Dennis Miller, manager of the PLRB’s
Pittsburgh office, 1,243 voted against
collective bargaining, while 719 supported
union representation.

Miller said that the 176 remaining ballots
were challenged by either the Pitt
administration, the United Faculty or the
PRLB and were not included in the count.

Philip Wion, president of the United
Faculty, the group that would have
represented the faculty in a union, said

that the upcoming departure of Pitt
President Wesley Posvar may have deterred
some faculty members from supporting
collective bargaining.

“I think there is widespread
dissatisfaction with salaries and other issues
within the university, ” he said, “but because
of the new president, I think many
colleagues decided to wait and see if there
is positive change under the new
administration.”

Union opponent Alan Janis, professor

of physics and astronomy, said that Posva r’s
departure influenced many faculty
members’ votes. “I certainly agree that
things haven't been the way they ought to
be, but it would be more appropriate to
see if the new administration works in a
more collegial fashion,” he said.

Wion said opponents of collective
bargaining used last fall’s faculty strike at
Temple University to mount union
opposition. “Temple created distorted

Pittsburgh City Council passed
a resolution yesterday calling on
Pitt President Wesley Posvar and
the Board of Trustees to reverse
their policy of withholding crime
reports from the public.

The resolution states the new

crime reports to anyone seeking
this information.

Council members unanimously
approved its passage.

Ferlo said it is “outrageous”
that the University of Pittsburgh,
an institution that receives a vast
majority of its funds from public
tax dollars, can deny the public
the right to know any public
information.

He said it is vital to the city’s
community block watches to
know of crimes and criminal
activities in the community, and
the same holds true for the Pitt
students, who are residents of

FSfP will continue to Work for peace after Gulf War

By Eric Hoch
Sta_[fW1‘iter

The Faculty and Staff for Peace has
pledged to continue to use education to
help people realize that international prob-
lems, such as those in the Middle East, are
complex and need to be resolved by “gen-
uine, innovative and peaceful means,”
according to academic adviser David
Hughes.

“Force stopped Hussein, but it can’t
solve the underlying problems of the Middle
East,” said Hughes. “This means we have
to stop taking a policeman role in the

problems in the Middle East and permit
the Arab people to deal with their own
area, including the [Palestine Liberation
Organization]. Permit them to deal with
their own problems on their own terms.
We have to tell Israel to stop blocking this
and start cooperating with its neighbors,
and we have to stop supporting minority
groups like the al-Sabah and other corrupt
regimes.”

Dan McKenna, press speaker for Sen.
Arlen Specter (R.-Pa), said that the senator
supports US. presence and guidance in
the Middle East. 1

“Something should be there until the

situation is resolved, but certainly there
should be nothing permanent in regards to
our influence in the area. The senator is not
for long-term involvement in the area,
militarily,” McKenna said.

According to Hughes, the Faculty and
Staff for Peace urges the United States to do
the following to promote a lasting peace in
the Middle East:

-Bring the troops home.

0 Drop support of the al—Sabah monarchy
in Kuwait and encourage self-
determination.

-Immediately begin the process of
enabling a permanent and comprehensive

peace in the Middle East.

-Recognize that the use of brute force is
a sign of weakness rather than strength
and renounce the use of violence as a
means for resolving conflict.

-Promote a National Energy Strategy
that moves the United States toward real
energy independence through energy
efficiency and the utilization of safe,
renewable energy sources

-Meet the serious challenges faced at
home by letting the American people reap
the benefits of the “peace dividend.”

the city of Pittsburgh.

“The students are residents of
the university campus and have as
much right as other city residents
have to know if there has been a
robbery, rape or other problem,"
he said.

Ferlo added that on a
fundamental level, the United
States has fought in enough wars
in its history to preserve some
basic freedoms, such as freedom
of the press, freedom of speech
and the right to know public
information.

Ferlo said he thinks 7bePittNews
is a responsible newspaper.

“ The Pitt News as an
organization can be held legally
accountable for irresponsibility,
so it is their prerogative to print
whatever they want in their
newspaper," Ferlo added.

Ferlo said the new campus police
policy ofproviding incident reports
with an incident description, date
and location of the incident is not
acceptable in place of the actual
police report because the
university is censoring information

that it is not allowed to censor.

“The only censorship I know
about in this country has to do
with violations of preserving
military information and things
that have to be protected for
national security,” he said. “I
don’t believe the campus police
records fall into this category."

Ferlo said he hopes the
passage of City Council's
resolution will encourage PC)S\'Zif
to listen to the broader
community’s opinions and
reverse the new campus police
record policy.

He also said he hopes 7‘/)eI’z'zr
News proceeds legally to get the
university’s new police record
policy changed.

Ferlo said he will be calling
State Rep. Ron Cowell, chair of
House Education Committee, to
inform him of City Council's
actions regarding the passage of
the resolution.

John Yeager, vice president of
the administration, who enacted
the new campus police record
policy, was unavailable for
comment yesterday.

Global warming can be slowed down

By Lynne Mosier
Staff Writer

Global warming can be slowed
down through conservation,
recycling and an increased
utilization of public
transportation, according to a Pitt
chemistry professor.

“But we won’t do those things,
so the future is not very bright,”
said William Schell, a professor
of radiation chemistry.’

Over the last 200,000 years, the
climate has gotten warmer and
then colder, according to Schell.
In the 16th and 17th centuries,
there was a small ice age, said
Schell.

“These temperature changes
have been caused by natural,
geological and geochemical
processes over time," said Schell.
“Luckily, what removal processes
are occurring naturally can
compensate for a lot of man’s
indiscretions. The atmosphere is
a buffer for many of the things we
do on earth."

“The critical thing that we’re
worrying about  is that by 2020
we’re going to have an excessive
amount of carbon dioxide and
atmospheric gases that can
markedly change the climate and
the ocean temperature,” Schell
said.

Carbon—dioxide levels in the
atmosphere have been increasing
since 1957, according to Schell.
In order to increase the climate’s

temperature, gases must remain
in the atmosphere for a certain
length of time. Oceans and trees
inﬂuence the residence time of
carbon dioxide, Schell said.

“Trees store a lot of carbon
dioxide," said Schell. “If you cut
the trees down, we’re going to
use less carbon dioxide. When
the carbon dioxide increases, the
residence time in the atmosphere
increases. The gases are going to
reflect the light and heat up the
earth."

“The ocean does a nice job of
absorbing carbon dioxide,
especially when it is cold,” said
Schell. “As the ocean warms up,
more carbon dioxide comes out.
With a change in ocean
temperature, we may flood every
major city.”

Global warming is an
international problem, but
successful regulation will have to
begin in the United States,
according to Schell.

“We’re in a rather unique
country here, where we’re
burning most of the fossil fuel,

and yet we’re not conserving,”

said Schell. “We would like to
regulate on a national level
because what happens
internationally, is other countries
look at the U.S. approach. They
don’t do it exactly the same way,
but they will use the same
guidelines.”

According to Schell, public
transportation and rail trans-
portation need to be increased.
Gas prices should be increased
to $4 per gallon, he said.

“When I fill up in Europe, gas
is $45 a tank for a small Fiat," said
Schell. “If we increase the cost,
we can use that money for
something besides defense. The
money could be a very significant
aid to our energy conservation. It
just has to be done. ’Ihey’ve done
it in Europe. We’re all in the same
game.”

World will not feel
effects of oil fires

By Lynne Mosier
Staff Writer

The oil fires in Iraq will have no effect on the global climate,
according to a Pitt professor.

“It’s a local effect,” said William Schell, a radiation chemistry
professor.

“The fire is coming out. There’s a lot of smoke and particles.
It rains out and it gets removed, so it won’t affect the global
climate,” he said.

The gases released will cause some changes if they reach
higher altitudes, but the lower area climate will not be changed.

“Some of the oil wells in Iraq are burning carbon dioxide, but
that is a secondary effect,” said Schell. “There’s not that much
in comparison to what we burn in our automobiles every day.”

Even though there will be no immediate effects on the United
States or the global climate, the oil vapor will pass over Pitt.

“We’ll see the oil vapor here every 10 to 12 days as it passes
around the world, but we can’t measure it because the
instruments we have are not sensitive enough,” he said.

Masada sponsors week of events on Israeli culture

By Chrissy Cullen
stag‘ Writer

Masada/Students for Israel are sponsoring
Israel Week from March 14 to March 22 to
raise awareness of Israeli culture and the
role of Israel in the Middle East.

Marc Reiter, president of the group,
organized the week, which will consist
movies, information tables and two
speakers.

Reiter said he wants “to give students a
‘different perspective of the war, and to
make them more aware of Israel and its
attitudes towards the gulf crisis.”

He hopes this week will give people an
honest look at the Israeli culture, which he
feels isn't provided elsewhere.

Israel Week will start off with a speech
from Eliyahu Kanovsky of Bar-ilan
University, Israel, a Middle East economics
specialist.

Kanovsky will speak about Israel, the
Middle East, oil and the gulf crisis.

The ﬁnal event of the week will be a
speech by Moshe Erez, an Israeli air force
major

Erez will discuss his views on the gulf
war. Erez will also be speaking at the Hillel
dinner later that day.

Other events sponsored by the group
are the movie AvarztiPopo1o and a video.
This presentation will promote trips to
Israel and work—study programs. Students
will also speak about their experiences in
Israel.

All events will be open to the general
public.

Reiter expects a moderate turnout.

“I would expect a fair showing of
people," he said. “Everyone is very
interested in the Middle East now, it seerris.
I would hope that they would give
themselves this chance to get more
educated [about] Israel, which we feel
they don't get [from] the press. One of the
main purposes of the group is to give a
more positive awareness and an honest
look at things."

"All you see in the news are soldiers,
and in fact, this is part of Israel, but it is not
Israel. There are so many other
achievements, such as cultural and
technical ones,” Reiter added.

The schedule of events for the week are
as follows: Kanovsky will speak on March
14 at 4 p.m. in Room IKS6 Forbes Quad.
AvantiPopo1o will be shown on March 17
at 7:30 p.m. in Room IP56 in Forbes Quad.
There will be an information table on
March 19 in the William Pitt Union
concourse.

On March 20 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. on the
3rd floor of the Cathedral of Learning,
there will be information about work-
study programs in Israel, along with a
video presentation and an opportunity to
hear students speak.

On March 22 at 3 p.m. in Room 232 in
the cathedral, Erez will speak. At 5:30 p.m.
on March 22, there will be a dinner and
discussion with Erez at Hillel.

Pitt students attend anti-war conference

By Ross Pasquale
Sta_ﬂ' W1-iter

Pittsburgh Students for Peace
sent six delegates to the National
Student Anti-War Conference at
Loyola University in Chicago, 111.,
from March 1-3.

The conference was planned
by the National Network of
Campuses Against the War and
addressed a variety of issues,
including racism, money for
education, the draft and ending
the war.

Sophomore PSfP member Tina
Howard said, “It was basically a
big teach-in. It was very
educational.”

Approximately 500 rep-
resentatives of 60 college and
high—school anti-war groups met
for the conference.

Melissa Moran, another PSiP
member, said PSH’ has voting
rights in NNCAW.

“It was good for learning
activism techniques,” Moran said.

He praised Schaefer for her
“sustained commitment to

“I incorporate a lot of different
things, like music and painting,
into my teaching," said Schaefer.

She said that she will spend her
share of the money on books,
and she hopes that the grant will
go toward new tape recorders,
record players and a new

“The United States wants

put another puppet in,” Moran
said.

Howard and Moran attended
workshops at the conference
dealing with topics such as the
anti—apartheid movement, civil
disobedience, developing
leadership, environmental issues
and racism.

“One of the biggest things I
learned was that this was a very
racist war,” said Moran.

She also said that racism has

Black Studies professors provide role models for BAS leader

By Alexis James
For Tbe Pitt News

With the controversy ton-
cerning blacks attending the
university, the deputy chairperson
of the Black Action Society said
she chose Pitt for two reasons,
and two reasons only.

Marta Effinger, an English
writing and black studies major,
chose Pitt because it was one of
the few schools that offered a
black studies program. Finances
were also a consideration.

The BAS recently said that it
can no longer recommend that
black students attend Pitt. Effinger
said one reason is a lack ofblack
administrative personnel.

“There is a great need for more
black faculty, not just in the black
studies department, but in all

aspects of the university," Effinger
said. Efﬁnger said hiring more
black faculty and allocating more
money for the black studies
department will be crucial deter-
minants in the future status and
success of black students at Pitt.

Although the number of black
professors is low, quality is
present, Effinger said. “As far as
the curriculum and professors
are concerned, I think [the black
studies department] is one of the
most positive aspects I’ve found
here at the university,” she said.

“I don’t credit Pitt with that. I
credit the black studies
department and the people in the
department who have provided
role models for me.”

According to Effinger, black
studies professors such as Barbara
Sizemore, Ph.D., Vernell Lillie,

Ph.D. and Rob Penny have been
very influential to her
academically, as a social leader
and personally.

“There aren’t enough professors
like Sizemore, Lillie and Penny.
So why not go to a university
where there are 10 Dr. Lillies and
20 Dr. Sizemores?" she said.

Despite the current controversy,
Efﬁnger said that she is grateful
for having the opportunity to
study and prove herself at the
university. She attributed many
of her personal achievements to
her family and church.

“My family and church have
been a major influence in my life.
Without them and without the
values and beliefs instilled in me
through them, I wouldn't be here
today.”

Effinger said she pays tribute to

African-American greats such as
Gwendolyn Brooks, Jeanetta Cole
and Shirley Chisholm. Efﬁnger
looks at Cole as a positive role
model for young black women
because “Cole shows that a black
woman can be a leader; she
doesn’t have to take that back
seat or secondary role.”

Though Black History Month
has come to a close, Effinger
said, “I don’t believe that Black
History Month is in February,
which happens to be the shortest
month of the year. I celebrate
Black History Month every
month.”

Because Effinger writes short
stories, poetry and plays, she
selected Brooks and Chisholm as
personal role models that have
influenced in her literary
achievements.

   

Although Effmger considers
herself a writer, one of her major
goals is to be known nationally
for her literary works, and she is
well on her way to achieving that
goal. A play that she has written
will be performed next fall by the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre, and a
collection of her short stories
will be published by Magnolia
Press, a small African-American
publishing company here in
Pittsburgh.

For now, Effinger’s main
concern is her education and the
educational situation for all black
students at Pitt. She said being
committed to the conditions of
black students at Pitt is very
important, but according to
Effinger, “how I perform
academically is very crucial to
what I can do for BAS.”

Efﬁnger said she hopes to
eventually become BAS
chairperson. She said, “I’ve gotten

so caught up in [BAS involve?‘

mentsl that I can’t let it go, and as
chairperson, I would hope to
provide the leadership that has
begun with the current
chairperson.”

Since Effinger began actively
participating in BAS, she said that
she has seen a positive progress-
ion among the students. ‘‘I think
that the black students’ particip-
ation in BAS functions has
improved in the last few years.
The students have begun to be

more aware, but there still needs

CISPES stages ‘die-in’ a

By Eric Hoch
Staj)" Writer

A “die-in” was staged by 27
people on Monday to kick off a
campaign for legislation that
would allow Congress to control
aid to El Salvador, according to
Pete Shell and Glenn Grodin,
members of the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador.

The “die—in” took place on the
lawn of the Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall and symbolized
those who have died in El
Salvador, according to Shell. The
“die—in” involved people lying
down on the lawn pretending to
be dead.

Sen. Brock Adams (D.- Wash.)
and Congressmanjim McDermott
(D.-Wash.) drafted The Peace,
Democracy and Development in
El Salvador Act which, according
to Grodin, who dressed as the
Grim Reaper at the rally, would
stop aid to El Salvador.

“The bill,” said Shell, “cuts all
aid and requires congressional

“As long as there are committed

down, depending on the
situation,” Hughes said.

perceptions. It’s unfortunate that
the administration tried to create
the impression that cases like
Temple happen often in collective
bargaining. That’s not the case.”

In a prepared statement, Posvar
called collective bargaining a
“mode that pits management
against labor.” These results show
that a majority of faculty members
agree that the missions of this
university are better served
through shared governance
among professionals than by
collective bargaining.”

Posvar said the disagreements
between the faculty and
administration should be settled
by “collegial processes and
consensus building."

Although disappointed by the
outcome, Wion said the United
Faculty had won a substantial
victory by securing the right to
vote. In November the PLRB
reversed a 1980 U.S. Supreme
Court decision restricting Pitt
faculty unionization, which the
administration had opposed.

According to Miller, the United
Faculty must wait at least one
yearbefore petitioning for another
vote. Wion said there may be
another vote if the new
administration ignores faculty
concerns, such as salaries, tenure
guidelines, poor management and
commitment to academics.

“Perhaps in two or three years
we’ll be back, and faculty will
again have the opportunity to
choose bargaining to solve our
problems,” Wion said.

The PLRB will certify the results
of the union election within the
next few days.

approval [for aid] to be reinstated,
instead of past bills which let the
administration reinstate the aid
when it wanted to."

“We send them a lot of money
of which only 10 percent is
supposed to be used for military
funds," said Grodin. "But the
government [of El Salvadorl is so
corrupt they use more ofit for the
military needs and not enough
for humanitarian needs. That aid
can be redirected through non-
government institutions such as
the church.”

As to whether or not this bill
will pass, Dan McKenna, press
speaker for Sen. Arlen Specter,
(R.-Pa.) said it is too early for the
senator to make a decision.

“The senator needs time to
study the issues and the bills and
make his decision from there,”
said McKenna. “He was part ofa
group that voted to cut aid to El
Salvador by 50 percent some time
ago."

McKenna said he did not know
if the senator had seen the bill
yet.

Pitt junior Working to take stigma from feminism ‘

By Rebecca Wilkins

Sta_[)'Writer

Pitt junior Mary Wivell says that
many people get turned off by
the word “ferninism,” but she and
other women’s rights activists are
working to change that.

‘I think that there is a lot of
stigma attached to the ‘F-word.’
All people need to do is get past
that, and they can ﬁnd that it's
very encouraging. Feminism, as I
see it, is a very positive thing.
We're not against anyone; we’re
just for people —— especially wo-
men," said Wivell, a member of
Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization.

Wivell, along with more than
700 other feminists, attended the
National Organization for
Women’s first Young Feminist
Conference in Akron, Ohio. Two
other CWO members went to the
conference with her.

‘‘I’d say the majority were coll-
ege women, but some of them
were young professional women,

and some of them were from high
schools across the nation,” Wivell
said.

She said that although most of
the participants were women, men
attended the conference as well.

“I think that a lot of issues that
we as feminists are concerned
about, especially regarding male
violence, concern a lot of men
too,” she said.

Forty-one states were
represented at the conference.

Events consisted of seminars,
speakers, and feminist-oriented
entertainment.

“They had seminars on a lot of
different women’s issues, ranging
from lesbianism to domestic
violence. Date rape was a really
hot topic the whole weekend,
and we covered a lot of issues
about the war that’s currently
going on," said Wivell.

Other topics included eco-
feminism, reproductive issues,
child care, pornography, and
violence against women.

interested in images of women.

“There was one seminar that I

doctors and dealt with contra-

“Because the medical
community is primarily male, they
found really slight side effects to
make these pills wholly
unacceptable,” she said.

“For one pill they said that a
side effect was conjunctivitis [an
eye infection]. That was the only
side effect, and they said, ‘Oh,
that’s unacceptable!’ Whereas the
current birth control pills that
women take now are potentially
life-threatening because of the

Norplomt offers lo

By Andrew Bruno
Stqﬂ‘ Writer

Women in the Pittsburgh area will soon
have an alternative means of long—term
contraception with the new Norplant
device.

Norplant won Food and Drug Admin-
istration approval on Dec. 10 and will be
available in Pittsburgh as soon as medical
personnel are trained to insert the device.

The Norplant system consists of six

small capsules, which are inserted under
the skin ofthe upper arm. The device lasts
for five years and is reversible at any time,
according to \Wj."€lT1-A’\'€fS{ Laboratories,
distributor of the system.

“During the full five years of use, the
chance of becoming pregnant averages
less than 1 percent a year,” said Dr. Marc
 Deitch, vice president ofmedical affairs
and medical director of \X“'yeth-Ayerst.

This makes .\'orplant 10 times more eff-
ective than birth~control pills, Deitch said.

to be more mass participation.”

iiflinger said it is important for
black students to know they can
change their situation at the univ-
ersity by being united and by
gaining power that can be passed
on to future students.

“Even though we say we don’t
recommend black students to
attend Pitt, we are still concerned
with the black student that re-
mains at Pitt. We need to continue
definite planning and try to
improve mainly the acadernic
conditions,” lifﬁnger said.

Pitt stance contradictory. ..

The University of Pittsburgh, some four weeks into its
practice of withholding campus police records, received
some bad news from City Council yesterday. According
to a resolution passed at yesterday's meeting, the First
Amendment rights of students should supersede those of
a censorship policy.

The resolution, a result of the work of City Council
member Jim Ferlo, stated that the university’s policy of
withholding these records denies vital information to the
public. It said the university should not only provide this
information to the media but to anyone else requesting
it.

“The students are residents of the university campus
and have as much right as other city residents have to
know if there has been a robbery, rape or other problem,”
Ferlo said.

But the bureaucracy at the University of Pittsburgh
refuses to buy the argument that it is a public institution.
Its argument has centered around the fact that Pitt is a
public university,and should not have to allow access to
its records.

This places Pitt in an ironic bind. The University of
Pittsburgh consistently denies that it is aprivate institution.
One of the fundamental arguments behind this policy
was that status.

A private institution, however, receives little or no
money toward the education of its students. Pitt gathers
well over $100 million of state and federal aid toward that
educational process. Ferlo said that it is “outrageous” that
Pitt, which receives most of its money from public taxes,
can deny public information from anybody.

The university is currently pleading its case to the state
of Pennsylvania, which announced that Pitt will receive
some $1 1 million less next year in state aid. The university
has threatened that it will have to raise tuition should this
cut take place.

This is not the action of a private institution. It is the
action of a blatantly arrogant university, believing that it
can have the best of both worlds It goes beyond mere
irony.

Since the petition was first distributed, The Pitt News has
gathered over 2,000 signatures from students, staff,
faculty and even concerned citizens. These signatures
show the overall support for the First Amendment and
show the university community’s disdain for the university’s
policy.

The city of Pittsburgh took a step yesterday to protect
the First Amendment rights of the people in this area.
Since the university would not listen to its own community,
The Pitt News can only hope that Pitt will take notice of
City Council's action and abolish its policy of censorship.

_

BAS goes too far with demands

This letter is being written in
response to the 14 demands
issued by the Black Action Society.
Most of these demands are
outrageous at best. The addition
of faculty to the black studies

department and the inclusion of
a student on the presidential-
search committee are the least
objectionable of the demands
made by the BAS. However, these
should have been submitted as
requests or suggestions, not as
demands. In my opinion, the
university would respond better

to a request than to a demand. If ,

your requests were not given any
consideration, then try a different
approach. There are proper
channels and procedures to
follow when trying to get a
problem resolved. Mr. Uustinl
Laing, have you tried any of these
approaches? I realize that dealing
with the system here is frustrating
as hell. Being rational in dealing
with Pitt will get you much farther
than making demands like a
spoiled child.

The Black Action Society is
going too far in making the
majority of its demands. I am
curious as to the miraculous deeds
that Mr. Laing and the BAS have
performed -to warrant the
preferential treatment that they
demand to get. The claim of a
lack of cultu ral activities available
to black students is ludicrous, to
say the least. The Carnegie
Museum is certainly one of the
top 10 cultural wastelands in the
United States. No one in their
right mind would ever think of
pursuing cultural interests at a
fine and respected institution like
the Carnegie Museum in the heart
of Oakland. I will admit that I
cannot think of many cultural
activities for blacks in this area. I
am Irish and German by descent,
and I can honestly say to you that
I cannot think of any cultural
activities in this area that are
strictly Irish or German in nature.
However, if I was upset because
I did not know of any ways that
I could celebrate my culture and

Letters

heritage, I would make a
concerted effort on my own part
to find these activities and
participate in them. My suggestion
to the BAS is do something about
it. If you don't believe that there
is enough black culture available
to students, why don't you start
new programs on campus? Is the
idea of actually doing something
on your own instead of whining
and complaining about it that
disturbing to you? Mr. Laing
mentions that there are activities
in East Liberty and Homewood
that blacks can participate in. I
am glad he has found a place
where he can celebrate and enjoy
his culture. The demand for a
van, from what I gather from his
letter to be provided gratis by the
university, running from Oakland
to these areas is so arrogant that
I still can't believe that BAS
considers it a legitimate demand.
l...] Most of the people that I
know take a bus if they don't
have access to a car. I am willing
to bet every cent in my name that
the Port Authority has at least one
bus that runs between Oakland
and these areas. What makes the
black student so special that taking
a bus is not good enough? That to
me sounds a bit elitist. [...l

For a reason unclear to myself
(and to many others that I have
talked to), the BAS wants Pitt to
cater to its every whim. You cry
racism at the drop of a hat but fail
to produce evidence that supports
your claim. The university was
not established for the sole
purpose of holding the hands of
the students who chose to enroll
there. Your demands, for the most
part, ask Pitt to do just that. This
may be different in the classes
that you are taking, but in the
School of Engineering, the black
students get the same assignments
andtestsasthe restof the students.
I do not believe that discrimination
is the cause of the poor graduation

rate for black students. [...l
Finally, I have a suggestion for
the Black Action Society. Any
changes in existing programs or
the implementation of a new
program takes time. Your March
12 deadline is laughable. It would
still be laughable if it were a
deadline for any remotely
reasonable requests. Do you
really think that Pitt would be
able to meet these demands (if it
so chose) in three weeks? The
next time you decide to make
outlandish demands, at least think
enough to allow some time for
them to be considered.l...l

Is celebration necessary?
Americans are understandably
happy that their troops are
beginning to come home from
the Persian Gulf. I, too, am glad
that so few American soldiers
died in the war in the Middle
East. I do not, however, see any
reason to celebrate our “victory.”
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi
soldiers and civilians have been
killed. These people have
families, friends and relatives
whose entire lives have been
devastated by the United States’
war in the Persian Gulf. The
Iraqis are human beings whose
lives are every bit as important as
those of American soldiers and
civilians. Instead of celebrating
and planning giant Fourth of July
festivities, Americans should be
thinking about what they can do
to prevent this kind of thing from
ever happening again.

Education answer to national bigotry problem

The American college campus,
known as a place for academic
and intellectual growth, has also
become a home of American-
style racism, misogyny and
bigotry. A few weeks ago, Douglas
Hann, 21, a graduate of Fox
Chapel High School, was expelled
from Brown University for
shouting obscenities outside a
dormitory. .

Hann’s verbal assault was
directed atjews, blacks and gays.
This was his second offense -
however, the university expelled
Hann for violating the school’s
1989 university code restricting
hate speech.

University administrators,
educators and civil libertarians
are facing a peculiar dilemma: Do

laws or codes against anti-gay,
racist, sexist or anti-Sernitic speech
violate the First Amendment? For
example, the University of
Michigan enacted a code against
hate speech, claiming such a law
was necessary to fight prejudice.
The prejudice on campus is real;
the National Institute Against
Prejudice reported more than 175
serious incidents on college
campuses over the last three years.
NIAP estimated that anywhere
from 800,000 to 1 million minority
students are involved in bias inci-
dents yearly. Black and gay stu-
dents are attacked for no reason
other than home-grown hatred
in our kinder, gentler nation.
The American Civil Liberties
Union, a longtime defender of

Mark
Smith

civil rights, challenged the
University of Michigan's hate-
speech code in court. The federal
court struck it down. The ACLU
challenged the code for being
constitutionally vague. The
organization argued that the same
regulations which can be used to
stop racist or anti-Sernitic speech
will ultimately be used to prevent
speaking out against such speech.

Destroying the First Amend-
ment will not fight prejudice. In
fact, disenfranchised groups need
the First Amendment to battle

political opposition to their fight
for equality. With the Reagan/
Bush—packed federal courts, the
First Amendment cannot survive
attacks from our civil-rights
community. If hate speech can
be regulated, it will only be a
matter of time before these codes
are used against non-dominant
or minority groups.

Brown University could have
prosecuted Douglas Hann for
disorderly conduct without a hate-
speech code. In response to his
first incident a few years back,
the school ordered him to seek
alcohol counseling and attend a
workshop on race relations.
Brown’s initial action is only a
beginning step for universities to
respond to our country's bigotry.

To unmask this nation's bigotry,
which all too often drapes itsel in
Old Glory, universities are
charged with the responsibility
to fight prejudice. Pitt's Office of
New Student Programs has
developed a multi-cultural
workshop for incoming students.
Penn State has a program to
educate bias offenders. The
University of Massachusetts is
moving to become more
educationally inclusive —
including an integration of black,
wornen’s and gay studies through-
out the departments at these
schools. Censoring bigots won’t
stop their ugly prejudice —-
education is the answer.

Censorship ta/ees place from Pitt to the Pentagon

For the first time in a while, the campus
is abuzz with the hot issues of the day. No,
I'm not talking about the war protesters.
(I'll save that for another column.) What I
am referring to is the single issue that
could cause as much of an uproar as the
backpack—checking controversy in the
cafeterias way back in ’87. That issue is,
naturally, the campus police blotter.

Or perhaps I should say, the lack thereof.
For about three weeks everybody has had
something to say about the Department of
Public Safety’s decision to withhold public
access to crime reports. Naturally, as soon
as The Pitt News got word of this, many
people rose up in righteous indignation
for one side or the other. Some wrote
letters. Some made T-shirts mourning the
loss of the ever—popular “campus police
blotter.” Some threw themselves out of
Towers windows in protest.

OK. I’m making this last part up. Still,
the general feeling on campus has been,
to quote a certain bedsheet, “bring back
the blotter.” Of course, whether this really
is for safety or entertainment purposes is
unclear.

Adam
Richter

I can’t help but wonder, however, if all
of this attention is going to affect the
outcome. The main question in this
controversy will probably be who will
prevail, instead of who is right or wrong.

After the big stink was raised about the
crime reports, the Department of Public
Safety decided to give The Pitt News pre-
edited reports. Although this information
won’t be given out in the same form as a
Colin Powell brieﬁng, so far it has been
just as enlightening. And, of course, we all
know how helpful the Pentagon typically
is to reporters.

I guess from the administration’s
perspective, releasing campus summaries
is a good way to lose some of the heat the
campus police has been catching. After
all, it’s pretty much what everyone wanted,
right? Now the police can go back to
catching criminals and not worry about
those nosy reporters anymore.

On the other hand, many feel this lack
of access to crime reports is censorship.
The Department of Public Safety has no
right to deny the media (or anyone, for
that matter) access to “public” records.
Darn it all, it’s a matter of First Amendment
rights!

Et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseum.

You can only take a “censorship”
argument so far, though. After all, in
today's world, evidence of it is supposedly
rare.

Take the Iraq war (or Desert Storm, or
whatever), for instance; thanks to modern
technology, the average American can
watch (on prime -time television, no less)
the path of a Patriot missile as it blows the
bejeezus out of a Scud.

That same technology can also be used
to bring us the bright shining faces of our
generals who pleasantly remind us that all
is going according to plan and the allies
have suffered a few casualties.

But many didn't see it that way. Enough
people didn't, in fact; The Department of
Public Safety announced that it would
release news summaries, hoping The Pitt

News would get off its back. So now
everything is hunky-dory, right?

I don’t think it’s that simple. One could
take these summaries as a token concession
or a sincere peace offering. Either way,
this whole mess (for me, at least) brings
back memories of the early ’70s, when the
Pentagon Papers were printed in both The
New York Times and The Washington Post,
courtesy of Daniel Ellsberg and Neil
Sheehan, despite a lawsuit by the Pentagon.

This was only one in a whole slew of
events where the press defended its rights
and won. Now it seems that the Department
of Public Safety is beginning to succumb
to popular pressure, little by little. I don’t
want to sound like I'm gloating, however.
Even if there is any chance to see the
campus police blotter grace the pages of

The Pitt News ever again, it won’t be too
soon.

But the powers-that-be had better watch
out. The fourth estate can be a pretty nasty
group when it wants’ to be. Just ask the
Pentagon.

Continued from page 10
Unable to compete economically
with its capitalist rivals, especially
Germany and Japan, the United
States is driven to resort to military
force. In this way the United
States can attempt to recolonize
the countries of the Middle East,
secure the oil resources of the
Middle East, blackmail its capitalist
rivals and reassert its dominant
position over the world economy.
This racist, imperialist war also
diverts attention from domestic
crises; such as the savings and
loan rip—off and the recession.

As part of the effort to reassert
its dominance over the world
economy, the American
government will also need to
attack the living standards of the
American working-class. This will
mean increasing cuts in vital social
programs. It will also mean
accelerating the attempt to slash
the wages and benefits of
American workers and increased
scapegoating of the international
working-class. This trend is
evident already in the attacks on
the Eastern, Greyhound and Daily
News workers.

Only a labor party dedicated to
fighting in the interest of the

international working class can
reverse the present situation. This
will mean placing political power
in the hands of the working-
class, nationalizing the means of
production and placing them
under rank-and-file control and
using the profits to directly fund
such things as education, health
care, day care, etc. If not, we
could well be facing a world war
that could spell the end of

humankind.

Counterpoint offensive

This letter is in response to the
College Republicans’ article in
Point-Counterpoint on Monday,
25 February 1991. One mistake I
see in the article concerns the oil
spill. I read last week in The Wall
Street Journal that we
overestimated the spill by 9.5
million barrels, making it a 1.5
million barrel spill, and that the
United States caused 30 percent
of the spill.

One of the statements you made
in your article really angered me
(and probably most others who
truly believe in Americans’
freedoms and rights) because you

say that peace protestors should
stop protesting. First, how dare
you (who think that the United
States is fighting for freedom in
Kuwait, which is a monarchy,
and its leaders and elite own
black chattel slaves) try to pull
my right to protest as a citizen of
the United States out from under
me? Second, the protestors are
chanting, “Support our troops;
Bring them home ALIVE,”
whereas pro-war people want
the troops to stay in the Middle
East and don’t seem to care whose
lives are lost. Which type of
support would you choose? That
brings me to another point How
do you have any clue how all of
the troops feel when you are in
the United States keeping up your
comfortable North American
lifestyle?l...l

Another thing that amazes me
is your complete lack of
knowledge about the history of
the use of U.S. power. You say
we want to use it to stop people
like Saddam, yet that power along
with the CIA helped to put
Pinochet into power in Chile who
killed tens of thousands of the
Chilean people. We also have a
selective policy regarding

takeovers of sovereign nations;
for example, when South Africa
(the Apartheid government which
has killed hundreds of thousands
of the people who have lived
there longer than the white folds
but are not allowed citizenship
because of the color of their skin)
invaded the neighboring country
of Namibia, the [United States]
did not do anything. Another
example is that when the Israelis
took over Palestine and forced
the Palestinian people to relocate
either to other countries or to
refugee camps, the [United States]
supported it. How do you explain
thisdifferenceintactirsassaddam
cannot be more similar to Hitler
than many of the Apartheid
leaders in South Africa are,
particularly since they exploit and
control and kill the people due to
their race?

The statement that you made
saying that the [United States]
does not start wars is incredulous.
The [United States] began this
war. Bush vetoed all U.N. security
council members’ attempts at
peaceful resolution. We also went
into Panama where we had set
up Noriega as the head of the
government, and we killed

thousands of civilians (and buried
them in one grave to hide the
numbers) in order to take the
power we gave him away. But
you would probably just call that
an invasion, not a war — almost
like Saddam going into Kuwait,
huh? We fund and have been
funding a war in El Salvador in
which our military aid has
succeeded in helping with the
killing of at least 75,000 civilians.
We were in Vietnam as early as
1959. We have conducted a
number of military actions, be
they wars or coups, in Central
and South America through
military aid, actual use of U.S.
troops and weapons and the CIA
since the late 19th century. Maybe
you should read up on these
issues in order to have a more
realistic view of how the [United
States] uses its military power
(usually to protect U.S. business
interests). [...l ‘

Contests
are aplenty
for brave
challengers

By Renee Crespy

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. —
Spring break in Daytona Beach,
Fla, is more than just sex, sun
and booze. It’s also contests,
contests, contests.

The contests were endless: wet
T—shirt, best bod on the beach,
bikini, best tan, belly flop, most
muscles and stupid human tricks.
Pitt students were right up there
in the thick of things, raking in
first- and second-place prizes in
many of the contests.

Amy Lea Boley, a pre—law
student at Pitt, won first prize in
the Howard Johnson’s wet T-
shirt contest and second prize in
two wet T -shirt contests at Razzles
and the Great Barrier Reef
nightclubs.

At the Howard Johnson’s
contest, Boley won S160 and free
drinks for the week. She gave the
free drinks to her friends because
she doesn’t believe in drinking.

“I don’t drink at all. I don’t
believe in it. Ifl drank, I’d lose
control even more,” said Boley.

Boley, who is a senior and on
her last spring break, said she just
wanted to cut loose for once in
her life and have as much fun as
possible.

“I just made up my mind when
I got down here that I was going
to go crazy, cut loose and have
fun. I’m really a conservative

person. I told my parents [about ..

the contestsl, and they were very
supportive once they recovered
from the heart attack,” said Boley.
“These contests are just a way of
expressing yourself.”

Some Pitt students expressed
themselves in a variety of other
ways.John Paletta, a senior, took
first prize in the belly-flop contest

“I did it because the guys
wanted me to enter, and just to
show off. I won with a jump
called ‘the flying squirrel.’ It hurt,
but that’s what you have to do to
win,” said Paletta. “I won a $50
bar tab, so it was worth it."

Bob Scharr, another Pitt senior,
won first prize in the stupid-
human-trick contest. He
performed his version of the
“reptile,” a trick in which he
stood on his hands, bent and
crossed his legs and swung them
under his head while still standing
on his hands.

“All I won was a nasty hat, a
pissy shirt and a cheesy lei. It
wasn't worth it at all. I thought I
was going to win a bar tab, and
that's why I did it,” said Scharr.

human tricks ran every so often,
but by far the most popular and
common ones were the “flesh”
contests, in which women, and
occasionally men, would get up
on stage and bare all for a
screaming mass of spring-break
students.

Some people, especially
women, thought that some of
these contests were degrading to
women, but for the most part the
women just wanted to see more
contests with guys in them. When
the Nasty Boyz, a group of male
strippers, performed at Attitudes,
the club affiliated with Howard
Johnson, women piled in to watch
these fine young men take it all
off.

Suesie Frane, a spring»breaker
from Purdue College, decided to
see male strippers as an act of
revenge against all the female
contests.

“I came here tonight because I
want to tuck as many bucks into
the guys’ G-strings as possible.
I’m taking revenge on this male

 

review,” said Frane.

“We came here tonight to see
some guys’ bodies instead of girls,
because we’re sick of watching
half-naked girls at Howard
Johnson all day long,” said Emily
Blacher, also from Purdue.

Dean Shelton, the manager and
a stripper for the Nasty Boyz, said
that he loves it when women
scream and cheer for him to take
it off. The louder they cheer, the
better he performs, he said.

“When women cheer, I feel
that I’m doing a good job
performing and that they’re
having a good time. I never get
nervous unless I’m doing a new
routine, but the routine I’m doing
now is one that I’m comfortable
with.”

Matt Botteicher, a junior from
Clarion University, summed up
just about everyone’s opinions
on the contests.

“The contests are a big plus
down here, and they really make
spring break a little more
interesting.”

‘the place’

  for variety

of reasons

By Renee Crespy
Sta 17 Writer

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -
Thousands of college students
pour into Florida every spring for
what has become known as
“spring break.” It’s a chance for
students to cut loose from the
pressures of midterrns and finals,
to party hardy or just to relax. Pitt
students went to Daytona Beach
for all those reasons and more.

Dom Febbraro, a junior at Pitt,
came to Daytona Beach to “hook
up” and party.

“I came down here to have a
great time, meet an exotic Florida
woman, make love to her and
then forget her name when I get
home,” said Febbraro.

John Paletta, a Pitt senior, came
to Daytona because he “couldn’t
afford to go to Cancun.”

Frank Paletta, a junior at Pitt,
came down to Daytona because
his friends were going, but instead
of coming down on the bus with
the Pitt students, he and his friends
drove down and stayed in a condo
on their own.

“Not everyone stays at Howard
Johnson’s. They crowd too many
people in those little boxes, and
we prefer to stay somewhere less
crowded and much nicer,” said
Frank Paletta.

Although Howard Johnson’s
was in the center of all the
activities‘ and it offered several
spring—break specials, many
students were less than satisfied
with the rooms and policies.

Doug Dzikowski, a freshman
at Pitt, said, “The hotel rooms are
junk —— the walls are thin, and we
had no clocks. The security in the
hotel was ridiculous; the guards
asked you for your ID even if
they knew your first name, last
name and birth date."

Pitt sophomore Willy Bitar
thought the rooms were OK, but
the check—in policy needed to be
changed.

“The hotel wasn’t bad, but I
thought it would be much better.

The cleaning ladies never cleaned, and it took hours to get
towels. But the worst part was how long it took for us to get
our keys at check-in. We waited five hours, and that was
bullshit; they should have had everything ready and waiting for
us when we arrived," said Bitar.

“I didn’t like the check-in, check-out policy at all. Check-in
is at 4 p.m., and check-out is at 10 a.m., and that really sucked,”
said Bitar.

Students also had many complaints about the strict drinking-
age policy that was enforced in the clubs around Daytona
Beach.

Most students under 21 had a good time but said that they
would have had even more fun if they were over 21 or had false
IDs.

Carl Urban, a 20-year-old Pitt student, said, “If you’re not 21,
go to the Bahamas, because if you’re under 21, you get ripped
off. You pay more and get less.”

Shelly Howard, a student from Michigan State, said, “I've
been going to the International Hotel every night, and they’re
pretty strict about underage drinking. I know some guy who
got caught drinking in a club, and he was forced to leave. So
they really enforce it."

David Claise, an employee at the Great Barrier Reefs night
club, said that the club strictly enforces the drinking age, and
employees look at IDs with a very critical eye.

“We really watch out for fake IDs, and we can usually spot
one a mile a way. Seeing so many IDs, you develop a real eye
for picking out the fake ones. When I come across a fake ID,
I usually just keep it and stamp them in as under 21,” said Claise.

Lisa Tempalski, a freshman at Pitt, said, “It’s really hard to
drink in clubs here if you’re not 21, but the clubs are still fun.
You just have to drink before you go out, and most of the time
it’s just as much fun and less expensive.”

NEW YORK —- With 10 seconds left in
the Pitt—Seton Hall Big East quarterfinal
last Friday, Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik
left his seat behind press row and
positioned himself halfway down the
tunnel leading underneath the stands.

The Panthers had just taken a 69-68 lead
on a Brian Shorter tip-in, and Seton Hall
had called timeout.

Standing back in the tunnel, it seemed

as if Bozik was afraid to watch what would
happen next — Seton Hall’s Oliver Taylor
driving down the lane and tossing in the
winning bucket.

Bozik just shook his head and made a
quick exit —— as did the Panthers from the
Big East Championship.

Pitt talked all season long about the
goals it wanted to accomplish before its
fourseniors graduate. But for Bobby Martin,
Darelle Porter, Jason Matthews and Brian
Shorter, the Big East tournament was just
the latest in a line of unrealized goals this

year

“This was our last Big East tournament.
We didn’t want to go out that way,” said
Matthews.

‘‘It’s frustrating, but there’s nothing we
can do about it,” said Shorter. “We just
have to look forward to the NCAAS to
come back."

Matthews, Shorter and his teammates
will get that chance —— their last ——
tomorrow at 12:15 p.m., when they host
Georgia in the first round of the NCAAS.

The Panthers are a No. 6 seed in the

Committee formed to find new AD

tournament, but there is no question that
the team is struggling at the moment. After
beating St. John's and Georgetown in mid-
February, the team has lost three ofits last
four games.

Only a come—from—behind win at lowly
Boston College has saved Pitt from total
collapse.

“I don’t know what to say,” said Pitt
Coach Paul Evans after the Seton I {all loss.
“We had a talk in the locker room
afterwards. We’re hoping the seniors can

Pens’ new lineup Works

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

A 10—person search com-
mittee has been named to find
a successor for retiring Athletic
Director Ed Bozik, Pitt President
Wesley Posvar told the Senate
Council Monday.

“I have selected a search
committee that has been very
carefully selected to include
Marshall Goldberg [trustee
emeritus] as chairman,” Posvar
said. “A very well-balanced
committee, it will work as a
panel of experts and wise
people to search out can-
didates.”

Included on the search
committee will be Vice
Chairman John Bolvin, chair-

man of the University Athletics
Committee and dean of the
College of General Studies;
Committee Secretary Carol
Sprague, associate director of
athletics for varsity sports;
Michael Boykin, Provost
Scholar and Pitt football player;
John Conomikes, trustee; Rose
Constantino, chairwoman of
the Senate Athletics Committee
and professor of nursing;
William Harmon, vice president
for student affairs; James Kelly,
professor emeritus of education
Martha Munsch, a director of
the Golden Panthers; and Jay
Rosenstein, former sports editor
of The Pitt News.

Bolvin said that the com-
mittee has met and will begin
advertising the position so that

a replacement will be found
before Bozik leaves office on
July 1.

Bolvin said the committee
will be looking for “someone
with administrative experience,
management experience,
athletic knowledge, especially
Division I athletics, and know-
ledge of the conferences, the
Big East in particular. A person
who is high on the list is
someone with high integrity
and understands the role ofthe
student athlete and athletics."

Academics have been one of
Bozik’s top priorities, according
to Bolvin, and the new director
will have to maintain this
standard.

“That has always been our

4-4 tie with Canadiens

Whoever says that the regular
season in hockey means nothing
obviously has forgotten that
March is a month. In a non-
division game at the Civic Arena
last night, the Pittsburgh Penguins
and Montreal Canadiens hooked
up in a terrific 4-4 tie that
highlighted two teams who will
have a lot to do with how the

disrespect meant to the world’s
second-best game.

The Penguins came into the
matchup winners of four straight,
including two victories over the

weekend.

The Pens also had a new look
with a defensive—minded lineup
thanks to the addition of new fan
fave Ulf Samuelson, Grant
Jennings and center Ron Francis,
who joined ranks last week when
Pens General Manager Craig
Patrick hooked up with his
baseball-card trading partner and
former Pen GM Eddiejohnston of
Hartford.

Pittsburgh has improved
defensively as fast as light. The
trade has thus far sparked some
sort of energy source in the Pens
overall on-ice habits, which now
include an intense desire to protect
the net. Bob Johnson and Craig

The Pitt men’s track team didn’t
get much of a spring break, as the
team traveled to Princeton, N.J.,
for the IC4A Championships and
to Tennessee for the NCAA
Championships.

Coach John Vasvary’s Panthers
were home only one day during
the one-week break.

They returned from a four—day
stay in New Jersey on Monday

and left for Tennessee
Wednesday, not to return until
Sunday night.

But the hectic week did not
prove to be fruitless.

Pitt ﬁnished sixth at the IC4A
Championships with 27 points.
There were 68 schools competing
in the meet.

“We’re pretty pleased,” Vasvary
said. “It was nice to get a
champion out of the meet, and
the experience [the runners] get
from a championship meet is
great"

That champion would be senior
Keith Dowling. The Big East
Conference 3,000—meter champ-
ion won the IC4A championship
as well, with a time of 8 minutes,
13.29 seconds.

Senior Elbert Ellis and junior
Brett Shields both scored points
for the Panthers in the 55-meter
hurdles.

Ellis finished second to James
Madison’s Jerry Rooney by one
one—hundredth of a second, 7.32
to 7.33. Shields finished fourth at
7.40 seconds.

Vasvary got a rather surprising
finish from his mile-relay team.

IMPORTANT MEASLES UPDATE!!

More than 500 cases of measles. also known as Rubeola. red or hard measles. or 10-day
measles have occurred in Philadelphia within the past month. Eight deaths have been
attributed to this outbreak. We are concerned about the possibility of spread to the Pitt

campus as students return from Spring Break.

Measles is on the rise among college students because the protection provided by the measles
vaccines they received in childhood is declining. Anyone born after 1956 now requires 2
DOSES OF LIVE MEASLES VACCINE AFTER THE AGE OF ONE YEAR in order to be
adequately protected. This means that many people who thought they were safe because they
were vaccinated as children now need to be vaccinated a second time.

Measles is highly contagious and can be spread from 4 days before symptoms develop until 4
days after the rash appears. The time from exposure to the virus until symptons appear is 8-
13 days. The early symptoms are fever. headache. cough. runny nose and eye discomfort
followed by a generalized red rash. If these symptoms develop gzﬂ the Student Health Service

immediately at 648-2841.

If you have not received the required 2 doses of measles vaccine. there is still time. Measles
vaccine is available at the Allegheny County Health Department. 3441 Forbes Ave. from 9:00
a.m. to 1 1:00 a.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. The phone
number is 578-8060. The cost for the immunization is $15. Don't delay — you may be able to

prevent a measles outbreak at Pitt.

Women's gym sets another school record

By J ohn Labriola
Staﬁ’ wraer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team proved that hard work and
dedication to the sport really do
pay off. During spring break t.he
Lady Panthers competed in three
meets and won them all.

The Lady Panthers started off
by defeating the Lady Indians of
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, 185.65 to 182.65
on Feb. 28. On March 5, the Lady
Panthers travelled to Kent, Ohio,
and defeated the Lady Flashes
184.3 to 183.55.

The team ﬁnished off its spring
break by defeating the T owson
State University Lady Tigers, the
No. 1 team in the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference,
186.65 to 185.50, breaking Pitt's
scoring record set in the IUP
meet.

“We had Thursday, Tuesday,
Saturday, all in a row,” said Kristin
Brown. “You had to be in the
gym in between there. You can’t
just take days off. No one went
home, and no one whined about
it. We all worked hard, and
breaking records is our reward.
It’s pretty cool,” Brown said.

“We had them in every day,

except for the day after the meet.
We worked out Sunday, Monday.
Competed Tuesday, took the day
off Wednesday, and worked out
Thursday and Friday,‘ said head
coach Debbie Yohman.

The Lady Panthers have shown
a great deal of improvement this
season, and the record books
show it. They have already
broken seven school records: the
uneven parallel bars record once,
the balance beam once, the floor
exercises twice and the team
score four times.

The Lady Panthers also have
tied several of their broken
records, including the uneven
parallel bars score three times
and the balance beam once.

After a full week in the gym,
the team came out with a
revamped beam squad that looks
to be as aggressive as it was last
season.

“We did team beam workouts
this week, and that’s what made
us stick today," said Tina Taylor.
“Usually we work out and get in
and out of the gym because we
have to study. But this week we
had no excuses for studying for
tests. We stayed in that gym until
everyone was finished on beam.

“We stressed the problem. We

cried beam together. We felt
beam together. We stuck beam
together, and it paid off in the
end. It’s hard when everyone is
in Daytona (Beach, Fla.) right
now laying in their bikinis getting
a nice tan, but maybe we can go
to Florida or something after the
season,” added Taylor.

On Saturday the Lady Panthers
showed the Lady Tigers what
Pitt was made of. The Lady
Panthers trailed Towson in three
of the four events of the meet. In
the ﬁnal round of the meet Pitt
performed the floor exercises,
while T owson performed on the
balance beam.

‘*1 think that beam was a key
element in this meet,” said
Yohman. “We stayed on beam,
and they didn’t."

The Lady Tigers experienced
three falls from the beam, while
the Lady Panthers experienced
only one.

“Today, Towson had a rough
time,” said Yohman. “They are a
better team than we saw today.
I think they are hurting a little bit,
and they let down a little bit.

“I think that they will be coming
full guns at us at ECACs, and I
still expect them to be the top
team.”

“This is the team to beat,‘ said
Tina Taylor. “They’re No. 1 in the
ECACS now, and we beat them.
We know we can beat the No. 1
team, so we know we can win
ECACs, which are held here.”

The Lady Panthers will be
competing against the
Mountaineers of West Virginia
University on Monday, March 18
at Trees Hall at 8 p.m. The team
has been waiting for this meet all
season.

Last year the Mountaineers
defeated the Lady Panthers 185.40
to 184.30, in the WVU Coliseum.
The WVU crowd for the most
part was pleasant, except for
several young men who were
yelling obscenities at the Pitt
gymnasts. This year, however,
the gymnasts won’t have to deal
with people trying to break their
concentration.

“We’re going to beat them,”
said Brown. “No questions, no
problems. We are ready. That is
our meet. We have been waiting
all year for that meet. Everybody
is going to be pumped.”

flowing in the Penguin

answer to it all could be
how badly the Pens want
to drink from the cup.

The Montreal Canadiens
came into the game 4-1-1 in
their last six and 3-1 on the
road including road wins at
Calgary and Chicago. The
Habs have been hurt all
year and are slowly getting
healthy. Coach Pat Burns
has done a remarkable job
in keeping Montreal within
striking distance of Boston
all year in the Adams
Division. The main man is
goaltender Patrick Roy, and
as long as he is healthy,
they are a legitimate
contender for the Wales
throne.

The action opened early
in the third period, as Mario
Lemieux blasted a line—drive

Pens a 1-0 lead.

Montreal answered twice
in the first period, as
Stephan Le Febvre netted
his fifth of the campaign.
Dennis Savard pulled an
unreal spin—o-rama move
on Randy Hillier and threw
a backhand shot past T om

Lady Pant/oer /ooops not invited to ‘T796 Big Dance’

By Ryan Btmcher
stag‘ Writer

The ﬁelds for the women’s
National Invitational Tournament
and the NCAA Championships
were announced Monday, and
Pitt was not chosen to participate
in either contest.

The omission is no great
surprise. Pitt’s record stands at
16-13, after being eliminated in
the second round of the Big East
tournament March 2.

The Panthers were blown out
in two of their last three games:
79-55 to Connecticut in the last
regular-season game and 107-92
to Providence in the Big East
semifinal.

The one victory was a first-
round 82-78 win over Boston
College.

The Lady Friars of Providence
had defeated Pitt in both of the
teams’ previous meetings this
season by 24 and nine points.
Providence has been just outside
of the Top 25 in recent weeks
and made the NCAA tournament.

“We had to get the ball inside.
I guess we did that, with Lorri
Uohnsonl, Jonna [Huemrich] and
Connie [Hurt] being our top
scorers,” said Pitt Coach Kirk
Bruce. “Our defense let us down.”

Johnson led Pitt with 27 points
and 17 rebounds. Starting center
Huemrich scored 16 points and
grabbed 12 rebounds, while her
backup, Hurt, scored 15.

Freshmen Erin Maloy andjenine
Joyce contributed 13 and nine
points, respectively.

Junior Tracy Lis topped the
balanced Lady Friar offense with
21 points, and senior Helen
Mency scored 19.

Of the high scores in Pitt’s
three meetings with Providence,
Bruce said, “That’s their style.
They give up one to score two.”

He also pointed out a Lady
Panther scoring drought late in
the first half as a key to the game.
Pitt trailed 4828 at the half.

The Panthers came out much
stronger in the second half,
scoring 64 points and hitting 60
percent of their shots (as
compared to 48 percent for the
game). “If we had a first half
anything like the second half,
we’d have been okay,” Bruce

said

Against Boston College, the
Lady Panthers faced a team they
had beaten twice this season,
once by 15 points. “We got offto
a strong start,” said Bruce. “We
had a 19-9 lead at one point That
was important for us — for our
confidence."

Point guard Maureen
McConnell returned from a hip
injury, although Maloy continued
to start in her place and played
most of the game.

Johnson had 27 points and
four rebounds in the game.
Huemrich had 14 points and a
team-high eight rebounds, while
Joyce scored 17 points to go
along with four rebounds.

Sarah Behn, one of the top
scorers in the Big East, led Boston
College with 30 points. Center

Carla Wenger, who gave Pitt
trouble in the last meeting
between the two teams, scored a
career-high 29 points and 11
rebounds.

Pitt must now wait until next
season. The team has a promising
future, having played with the
youngest lineup in the Big East
this season.

Johnson, arguably the best
player in the history of Pitt
women’s basketball, was the only
senior to start all season. She was
named to the All-Big East first
team. Reserves Hurt and Turia
Ransom are also leaving. Three

freshmen played key roles: guard
Maloy, forward Joyce and center
Huemrich, the Big East rookie of
the year and the only player to
start all 29 games this season for
the Lady Panthers. Sophomores
Lisa Fessler, McConnell and Jill
Mcfilhinny all started when
healthy this season.

A key to Pitt's success next
season could be a player who did
not participate this season ——-
Shannon Davis, a 6-foot-3 former
High School All-American. Davis,
who transferred to Pitt from
Virginia last year, could be a star
if she is academically eligible.

As Pitt students loaded
themselves into planes, trains
and cars for spring break,
members of the Pitt hockey club
were gearing up for the weekend
of their lives.

The Western Pennsylvania
College Hockey Association held
its twentieth annual
championship games on March
2 and 3.

The teams competing this year

. for the WPCHA title were No. 1

seeded West Virginia University,
No. 2 seeded Pitt, No. 3 seeded
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and No. 4 seeded
Allegheny College.

Pitt won the title by defeating
the West Virginia Mountaineers
4-3, scoring the winning goal
with just over a minute remaining.

On Saturday, March 3, in the
first round of the playoffs, the
WVU Mountaineers took on the
Allegheny College Gators and
skated away with a 3-1 victory.

The second round of the
playoffs found the Pitt Panthers
skating against the IUP Apaches.
The Panthers managed to defeat
the IUP squad 5-4 in double

overtime.

The Apaches took a quick 3-
0 lead over the Panthers in the
first and second periods.

During the third period the
Panthers began to come back to
life. Four minutes into the period,
Rich Skalosky scored the
Panthers’ first goal. Assisting
Skalosky was Andy Ross.

The Panthers’ celebration was
cut short when the Apaches
slipped the puck past Panthers’
goaltender Marc D’Amico.

The last four minutes of the
third period belonged to Pitt.
They managed to pull themselves
together and score three
consecutive goals at 11:49, 12:07
and the 13:25 mark.

Netting the final three goals
for the Panthers were Ed
Gregorchik, Skalosky and Brent
Spitzer. Earning assists were;
Skalosky, Dave Koval, Spitzer,
Kip Linse and Ross.

The Panthers and the Apaches
came out with a vengeance in
the overtime periods. The
majority of the time was spent in
the Apaches’ zone.

The Panthers were able to
keep the Apaches from setting
up for a decent shot on goal.
With 1:42 remaining in OT, Bill

Crousey was able to net the
winning goal off Skalosky and
Koval.

On Sunday, March 3, the
competition was a lot hotter. Both
teams were able to hold each
other scoreless during the better
part of the first period.

Yet with eight seconds
remaining in the period, the
Panthers’ left defenseman Linse
was able to get the puck past Dan
Hollis, the Mountaineers’
goaltender, off an assist from
Eugene Barilla.

The second period turned out
to be much like the first, with two
exceptions. First, the Panthers
scored with 2:03 remaining in the
period, and this time it was Koval
being assisted by Crousey scoring
the goal.

At the end of two periods the
Panthers were holding a 2-0 lead
over the Mountaineers.

The third period proved to be

the period in which the
championship title was up for
grabs.

The Mountaineers were able to
rally themselves together and net
their first goal of the event. Jeff
Lienhart scored an unassisted goal
at the 4:32 mark.

The Panthers were able to cut

the Mountaineers’ celebration
short by scoring a goal 41 seconds
later. Scoring the Panthers’ third
goal was Skalosky with an assist
going to Koval.

The Mountaineers were not
going to give up the fight easily.
Only 17 seconds after the
Panthers’ third goal, the WVU
squad netted their second goal
and followed that up with an
additional goal to tie the game at
3-3.

basic stand here, so that wouldn’t
be changing. We tend to
[emphasize] the student in the
student athlete [who] we think
has to be both academically and
athletically capable."

Posvar added that academics
must be a high priority of the new
director.

“First of all [is] the concept of
the scholar athlete, a person who
is qualified to graduate. We want
definitely to avoid exploitation of
athletes, such as that has occurred
in the Southwest and Southeastern
pan of the U. S., where they bring
in kids who just barely got by and
are just doomed to flunk out,"
said Posvar. “We want them to
graduate, and we want them to
have a career and ethics."

Posvar said that Bozik’s
replacement will beneﬁt from
playing by the NCAA’s rules.

“I think that a smart, ethical
administrator will come to
recognize that pushing the rules
and exploiting kids is unwise. It’s
just bad athletic policy -- you
don't win as many games. To
have poor students on the team
doesn’t make you a better team.”

"I think the new athletic director
will be coming in at a time of
NCAA reform,” Bolvin said. “We
just went through the first stage of
that reform earlier this year at the
NCAA meeting. I think that reform
movement will continue, and we
will look for someone who would
be supportive of that in the
forefront.”

Bolvin said Pitt is looking for
someone to lead athletics into the
21st century.

“We always hope the person
we select will be the kind of
person who will be here for a
while. We've always had stability,
and I think that is what you
want,” said Bolvin.

Gymnasts chalk up victory at ECAC Championships

By Sharon Kerestes
Sta_[)" Writer

The men’s gymnastics team
used its spring break as an
opportunity to get certain things
accomplished. On March 3 at
Ohio State, the Panthers scored
271.9 points and came within
one tenth of the school record.
Then they ended the week at the
University of Vermont by winning
the ECAC Championships and
scoring high in individual
performances.

The Panthers placed third at
the Ohio St. meet behind No. 2-
ranked Oklahoma (284.15) and
No. 3 Ohio St. (281.5). Kent State
was fourth (268.15).

Pitt overcame the 270-point
obstacle it's been trying to get
over all season and drew closer
to its season goal: qualifying for

the NCAA Regional meet on April
6. To do that, the Panthers’
average score must be among the
top ten in the East. Ohio State is
one of four teams that already
has a qualifying spot sewn up,
said Panther coach Frank
D’Amico. Penn State, Iowa, and
Minnesota are the other sure bets,
he said. Oklahoma is a member
of the western region.

“Last week’s meet was great,"
D’Amico said. “Everybody had it
together, and there were zero
breaks after three events."

The team score went down to
265.75 at the ECAC
Championships, but Pitt came
away with the title, beating the
University of Massachusetts,
William and Mary, Vermont,
James Madison, Cornell,
Springfield, Southern Connecticut
and MIT. This year’s ECAC

Championship allowed team
scoring for the first time.

Although his team won the
championship, D’Amico said, ‘We
had an OK team meet —just OK.
We couldn't score the 270 we
were hoping to make.”

Scores of 270 or higher translate
into a better chance at regional
qualiﬁcation. “Maybe we were
under the gun too much,"
D’Amico said. “We’re worried
about trying to make a score so
bad that we get close to it, and
then we have some breaks."

Regardless of the overall team
effort, D’Amico said the Panthers’
individual performances were
exceptional. They advanced the
maximum two gymnasts to finals
in every event except vault;
Genaro Severino was Pitt’s sole
qualifier in that event. Of the 11
qualiﬁers, nine came away from

possibility at this moment because
lots of people got very good
scores [this weekendl," said
D’Amico.

Individual qualifiers are
determined by averaging their
three best scores in an event.
After the top ten qualifying teams
are determined, gymnasts (non-
members of those teams) with
the top eight averages in each
event advance to regionals.

Gonzalez’s pair of 9.653 on
pommel horse Saturday and
Severino’s 9.65 (in prelirns and
finals) on vault give D’Amico
good reason to believe they’re
both “in” at this point. Freehling,
MacBeth, Bausmith and Mike
Englert also have chances to
qualify, he said.

pick it up  They know it’s their

last chance.”

“We’ll be right there. We just *

have to do the little things: go
after loose balls, don’t give the
other team second shots, just
work hard in practice. That’s all,”
Porter said.

But it may not be that easy.
After all, that’s what the team has
said it had to do all year. And
although the Panthers reached
the 20-win mark for the first time
in three years (20-11) and
dramatically improved on last
year’s record (12-17), much more
was expected from this team,
picked as a preseason top-10 .

A major problem has been Pitt’s
inconsistent playing all season
long. After being destroyed by
UCLA 112-85, the team used a
talk by former guard Curtis Aiken
to reshape its attitude. That
resulted in a strong 86-80 victory
over Seton Hall.

But then the team barely beat
Boston College at home and
played a dismal game in a loss at
Seton Hall. The Panthers bounced
back with two of their finest
games of the year, wins over St.
John's and Georgetown, only to
get blown out at Syracuse.

“The seniors will either go one
way or another [against Georgia],”
said Evans. “They've got a chance
to do something. I was not
unhappy with the Seton Hall
game. I think we played good
defense. We kept our turnovers
down, and Bobby Martin played
better than he has been playing."

The Panthers have never played
Georgia in basketball, but Evans
thought the matchup was a fair
one for his ball club.

“I ’ve only seen Georgia a couple
of times, but they finished strong
 The six seed is fair. Look at
Virginia; they have to play
[Brigham Young] in their back
door [Salt Lake City], and if they
win that, they get Arizona next.

That’s the difference between one
seed,” said Evans. “I’d rather be
where we are than where Virginia
and Villanova [who plays
Princeton] are. We were right
there where we thought we might
play Princeton in the first round.”

PITT BITS: Pitt is 0-4 this year
in games with starting times
around noon, with losses to
Georgetown, UCLA, Syracuse and
Seton Hall (in the Big East
Tournament)
