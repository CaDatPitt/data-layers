Pasternak is a Russian writer

the‘ ﬁnest creative artists in

However, during the years of Stalin’s reign, Pas-
ternak was quietly “muzzled” for the good of
the state. . , ‘ ; ‘ ,

He, accordingly, ,turned‘his signiﬁcant talents

-to translation, where he could, not be accused of
~ producing socialist blasphemy. His work in trans-

lating-Shakesp'ea're’s writings was an\accomplish-
merit of the highest-scholarship. His_critica1 essay
on Hamlet,~- additionally, remains a classic among
classics of ihterpretation. After Sta1in’s death, in_

‘ March, 1953, Pasternak returned to ﬁction writing

and settled down to write a deﬁnitive delineation

_, of what he had. seen happen to his countryduring

his own lifetime. , _ ,
The result of his efforts was Dr. Zhivago, a

novel dealing with the life of a dedicated Russian

physician who was a young man during the "revo-

itself was, developing-.,t A V W p.
The book relates the successes and failures of

the system as Dr. Zhivago experienced them. The ’
' narrative includes poems which the doctor writes
in his later years, and philosophical_ ruminations

about the effect of Lenin-’Marx-Stalinist doctrine
upon the giant country-aridits people; ’
Zhivago “Warmly Received

After a series of complicated publishing maneu-
vers, the bookwas translated into English from the.
-Italian edition. lt has not yet been printed in the
original Russian! Zhivago was warmly received by
U. S. reviewers who noted ‘a ‘familiar strain of the

-great‘Russian novels in it. Last.month the Swedish.

Academy of’ Arts and Sciences perceived the ‘same
distinctiveness‘_'in if and declared Pasternak the

,winner of the 1958 Nobel: Prize in Literature.

e‘What has happened since then is sad matter of
general knowledge. Pasternak accepted the Prize,
then rejected it; he was denouncedall over Russia
as’ a friend of capitalism and the West; Krushchev
invited ‘him to leave the country; Pasternak was
expelledfrom the Union of Soviet Writers; inevit~
ably, the furor caused him to become physically

.exhausted and ill. In the small village near Mos-

cow where he lives, Pasternak has gone into seclu-
sion for an indeﬁnite time. He will wait for the
storm to subside, as it eventually must.

And what caused all this to happen?.As is so‘
often the case in _a time of world crisis and indi- .

vidual insecurity, art is viewed through political
contact lenses. The Communist regime refused to
publish Pasternak’s book because of some implied

‘criticism of socialist ideology which it contains.

When the book became a “cause” in the free

~world, the‘ government was worried. The Nobel‘

Prize conﬁrmed the -worst fears of the Russian
lords: many people‘ would read’ the book and be-
lieve that the Russian people were dissatisﬁed
with Communism. So the pressure was applied to

Pasternak and he was obliged to repudiate the

Prize. ‘But the personal character

continues. .~

Repudial-ion of Communism? . _
‘ Dr. Zhivago, as viewed in the‘ United States‘, is

a repudiation of the Communist system. The parts

assassination

., excerpted by newspapers, to “prove” that we are

right and Communism is wrong are naturally
taken out of context‘ I  ' f

The book is no more a political diatribe, as
some would have‘us believe, than are any of the
other‘ great Russian classics. There is judgment

, passed of course, but only as itcoritributes to the

substance of the narrative. As the Russians erred
in condemning the book on political grounds, U. S.

, observers are wrong in terming it an “afﬁirmation

of the democratic way.” .
Dr. Zhivago is the eloquent explanation of a
thinking man’s‘s'trivings to be faithful-to his own
philosophy of life. The‘ book ‘has been forced
through and embarrassing political mill which has
distorted its signiﬁcance as a work of art.
Pasternak remains ;in Russia, a tribute\ to his

devotion to his own land and to his desire to vine‘
dicate his artistic intentions to his fellow men.
_Pasternak stands as a lonely bastion of individual .
‘conscience in a land where that characteristic is

frighteningly _ scarce. V

He is the detached-_, observer of the tuinultous -
‘stage of world‘ events, who,‘ by his declaration of
. simpleptruth, hasbrieﬂy turned the spotlight away
from the. deepening tragedy and onto himself. His . ~

bookshould have a -wide and sympathetic reading
in the United_States. The artist who has main-
tained intellectual respeotability ‘anywhere in the
world deserves to be listened to. p

Again Russia has produced what may be a
classic of our own generation, despite the ob-
stacles she may have placed in her artist’s way.

I We may pause.to ask why declarations of human

freedom are so scarce -in our own land, the strong-

hold _of the right to disagree and speak freely.‘

‘I09 ATWOOD STREET

for the ﬁnal contest of the 1958 soccer schedule for Coach Leo
Bemis’ booters Saturday. The contest is slated to get under‘-
way at 10:30 am. at the practice ﬁeld across from the ‘Field

,House. .
The‘ Lions "will bring with

them a record of four wins

and four losses. _Coach Ken Hos—¢
terman stated," “This has been the
worst season in all my years
coaching soccer here at Penn State.
However the boys are looking for-
ward to this game with Pitt.”

Victims of the Lions have been
Bucknel.l, Syracuse, Colgate, and
Temple. They were beaten by
Westchester, Maryland, Army and
Navy. ‘Both service teams also de-
Ieated the Panthers.

Leading the. Lions are two
high scoring forwards, Bill Fied-
ler and Mick Stollemyer. The
team has been averagin 3C6
goals per game while holding the
opposing. teams toetwo goals per
game.

The Panthers also have been
experiencing_ an “off” season. They
have a record ofthree wins and
six losses. However the Panthers
have won two games in a row and
have shown marked improvement
in their latter ‘encounters.

Playing their last game for the
Blue and Gold this Saturday are
nine seniors: Ron Goga, Bill
Eisinger, Lee Goodman, James
Gottesman, Jack Horox, Chuék
Kane, Gregory Morris, Jason
Shrinsky and Al Solomon.

Both Goga and Eisinger have
played a vital part in the suc-
cess of the team so far this year.
Their defensive play, along with
that of fullbacks Ron‘ Wyatt and.
Ron Podmilsak, has helped hold

the opposing teams to an aver-
age of 1.1 goals per game.
In contrast to the ﬁne defen-
sive play Bemis has been getting,

= the Panthers ha\’7e failed to pro-

duce many goals. They have been
averaging 1.3 goals per game, .but
six of these goals came in their
last contest.

The Panthers will also be seek-

.ing revenge when they meet the

Lions._ Last year when the_ booters
traveled to University Park with
an eight and one record, they were
humiliated by the Staters, 10-1.

weeks, the Yogis have been forced
to give up a column of space and
include the Yogae’s predictions in
print. This is, indeed, a precedent-
breaking event. The sacred realm
has been entered. ‘

Now to introduce (and then to
eliminate) the Yogae: first there’

is Joanne Dolinar, a sweet young
thing ,who picked only 12 of the
games correctly last week. Patricia
Perri only had a 7-8 mark in the
‘past 15, but her claim to Yogae
immorality is her 10-3 record of a
couple weeks back.

‘The third Yogae is the girl wh_o
has the daﬂiest way of choosing
her winners, Lynne Munro. She
managed to select 11 victors this
week. ~

There’s nothing more to say ex-
cept look for the bloody results
on these pages next week. ‘
