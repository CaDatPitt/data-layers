Pitt.

Penn State.

Already both Eastern dynasties
have played 2! football games in this
most ornery 1983 season. Of these
games, some were highlyimportant,
some weren’t.

Even other ﬁnal outcomes. can be
regarded as — well — no comment.

In all likelihood, absolutely no one
will say that the games of the last sev-
eral weeks have had a bearing on the
outcome of tomorrow’s l p.m. kickoff
in Pitt Stadium. This is the one foot-
ball game for both the Panthers and
the Nittany Lions that has a reserved
seat on the schedule: at the end.

First, both schools compete in'l0
(Penn State ll) exhibition, or prepar-
atory, courses th-is year. After tomor-
row, the ﬁnal grades will be in. Penn
State head coach Joe Paterno has
already passed 14 times, with only
three failings to mark his record.

In his second year, Pitt head coach
F oge Fazio will attempt to recover the
credit hours he erringly missed in last
year’s 19-l0 drubbing by ending
doubtful speculation with a 9-2
record.

' “Right now I feel really good,”
Fazio said._ “We have nothing to

prove. What happened last year hap-
~ pened last year. That will-have no

bearing on this weeke_nd. We’ve got-
ten a little older and a little better.
With the experience since then, we’ve
improved."

Perhaps because he has been
around this annual affair a little
longer, and endured 17 consecutive
rounds of verbal onslaughts from
each side of the state, Paterno literally
revels in the tumultuousness that is
Pitt-Penn State.

“This is one of the really good tradi-
tions and rivalries in the country,” he
remarked. “I don’t know if there’s any
game played with more intensity. And
with Pitt’s program being rejuvenated
in the last eight to 10 years, I don’t
know if there’s more at stake with a
national championship or Eastern
supremacy usually on the line.”

Last year, that was exactly the case
for both teams.‘ The year before that,
Pitt and Penn State had equal shots at
a national title and hopes of going into
the Sugar Bowl, but Pitt's hopes were
shattered by Penn State’s 48-14 vic-
tory at Pitt Stadium.

_ Now, both teams carry different"

goals into this intra-state clash, Pitt
more so as it scours the Nits for a win
never mustered since a 14-9 showing
in 1980. And that was the Panthers’

second straight victory _at Beaver
Stadium. 3 '

The Panthers also wouldn’t mind
taking a seven-game winning streak
into the Fiesta Bowl and put that up
for grabs against the victimized par-
ticipant of tomorrow’s‘ Michigan-
Ohio State donnybrook.

Penn State finds itself in a radically
different mood. Never mind that both
teams want this victory to leave a
sweet, year-long aftertaste; ‘Penn

’ State finds itself in a no-lose situation

—_ earlier this year, critics were sug-
gesting that perhaps the Nits should
be demoted to Division III.

It is a team on the upswing after
defeating Alabama, West Virginia
and Notre Dame in one six-week
stretch. Those came after humiliating
performances against Nebraska (44-
6), Cincinnati ( 14-3) and Iowa (42-34),

the last two in what quickly became a-

Death Valley of sorts.

After Iowa's win, Penn State’s sta-

tistics could have left the Grinch grin- '

ning. Paterno had never before
experienced three straight losses in his
18-year PSU career. Three_quarter-
backs became entangled in a sorrow-
ful situation. Current QB Doug
Strang became third-string after start-

‘ ing against Nebraska.

Friday, November 18, 198 ‘

Strang’s thoughts of transferring
died away when Paterno found inepti-
tude in two others. A I7-of-36 perfor-
mance for 254 yards and three TD

“against Iowa can do that.

Still, all was not totally cured. Penn
State’s three opponents emerged with
total offensive shows that outdid the

Nittany Lions’ by over 100 yards.

Although the defense was still not '
in the grooveto which those at Line-
backer U." are accustomed, changes
did occur once Penn State rolled past

Temple for its first victory.

Now, after reelingoff seven of
eight-point majorities, Penn State
remains unsatisfied.‘ It’s easy to see
why; the -Nittany Lions are saving
their final punch for tomorrow. That’s
just the.way it is between these-two

fighters who prize’ their pride.

Speaking of which, the Nittany
Lions never established a dominating
defensive front this season. Time may
have already run out. The Nittany
Lions have surrendered over 475 rush-
ing yards to six teams, have held only

two teams below 321 total yards, have
allowed 429 yards per game and own a
defensive effort (242 yards, at Temple)
that is 37 yards better than Pitt’s aver-

age per game (279 yards).

 Workshop Stresses Basic Skill “amber

Composer
Orchestra Conducts i

Concert

' By CATHERINE KIRSCH

Academic skills _development
opportunities are available to the
university community through Pittls
Learning Skills Center. 7

With its inception in 1974, the

center was predicated on the notion
that “those concerned about aca-

, demic progress and direction seek to

achieve the best results for the time
and effort expended in the process of
learning,” coordinator Georgine
Materniak said.

The Learning Skills Center is not
solely for those experiencing aca-
demic difficulty, Materniak said,
but can benefit honor students,
graduate students, staff and faculty
as well. The vast majority of stu-
dents who use the service have
Q.P.A.’s ranging from 2.75 to 3.25.

Diagnostic tests are administered
to assess the individual’s skill level in
math, reading and studying.

The reading skills sequence begins
with the application of the Nelson-
Denny Standardized Test, which is
administered by a reading specialist.
The test evaluates reading skills in
relation to vocabulary, speed and
comprehension. A self-rating check
list is then completed by the student
to determine how he approaches cer-
tain types of literary material.

Follow-up services include indi-
vidualized reading and open lab,
speed reading and effective-reading
programs. .

“The six-week - speed reading
course is most popular,” Materniak
said. The course teaches the student
to master flexibility of speed while
simultaneously optimizing the effi-
ciency of comprehensive skills. The
center charges a $5 fee for this
course. All other services provided
by the center, however, are free.

The effective reading workshop is
a six-week program that meets once
per week for two-hour sessions. The
first hour is devoted to group-
oriented instruction in which basic
concepts are stressed. Individual lab
work is reserved for the second, half,
Materniak said._

The mathematics division consists
of two components — math tutoring
and a math anxiety workshop.

The function of the workshop is to
“de-sensitize” the anxious student,
Materniak said. Stress reduction
techniques are coupled with streng-
thening of basic math skills to estab-
lish a comprehensive base.

Math tutoring, conducted by
trained undergraduate teaching
assistants, is offered for all courses
from the algebra and trigonometry
sequences (Math 3A and 3B)
through first-level calculus (Math
22).

“The methodology incorporated

in the five-week study skills work-‘

shop is unique to the Learning Skills
Center," Materniak said. “The
‘approach combines memory theory
and informaiton processing theory

in a traditional study skills instruc-
tion format.” a

Materniak said the workshop
teaches the individual to be a better
processor ‘ of information through
the natural applicaton of one’s
knowledge of what techniques work
best for him.

The program emphasizes text-
book reading strategies, note-taking
skills, time-management principles,
test-taking techniques and general
memory improvement strategies, as
a foundation for learning.

The center,’ a division of The Uni-
versity Counseling and Student
Development Center, enhances
one’s efficiency and confidence
through the application of learning-
skills strategies, Materniak said.

  Decisions

This weekend, after the hoopla over the Pitt-Penn State

game has died down, two television shows that are pur-

ported to be somewhat thought-provoking will be aired on
two of the major networks. .

One is historical, and the other, God forbid, may be

— prophetic. NBC will air its mini-series “Kennedy” to coin-

cide with the 20th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassi-

nation. ABC-TV will air “The Day After,” a supposedly

nonpartisan look at the controversial nuclear arms race. The

latter takes place the day after the bombs drop and shows the V
' devastation among citizens of a Kansas town — known

better as Middle America. .
Both of these shows will undoubtedly spark emotions in
all generations of Americans. Those who lived during the

Kennedy Administration and loved-him, and even those who ‘
did not, will be glued to the set watching the events that led -

up to his untimely death. . '-

on the other side of the dial, Americans who are deeply
concerned about the nuclear arms race will be tuned in to see
their fears dramatized. But “The Day After” will probably
also attract those viewers who are unsure about the issue.

Unfortunately, both of these shows air in the same time
slot Sunday night thanks to what is known as the
“November ratings sweeps.” That is when all three networks
pull out the big guns (i.e. box office smashes) during a

one-month period to gain percentage points in the Nielsen

Rating wars and stay on top. .

NBC, ABC and CBS are the ones fighting this war, and A’

we, the viewers, are the spoils (as well as advertisement
contracts). However, we are also the losers many times.
It is these wars that determine what we watch on network

‘ television night after night for better or for worse. Some-

times, the offerings are worthwhile, and sometimes, they are
not worth the effort of switching on the set. Yet, no matter
how much we gripe about the daily offerings, we still con-
tinue to watch the programs dished out to us.

Sunday night produces a dilemma for television watchers.
Although “Kennedy” is on for three nights, the first part ofit
will‘be shown opposite “The Day After.” People who want
to watch both will either have to have two televisions or keep
switching back and forth between commercials.

The networks have us right where they want us: in their

_ grips.

lt’s a shame that whenltelevision finally does offer some
insightful programming, theprograms are on back—to-back

instead of on different nights. The network presidents will be ~

sitting back Sunday night watching the Arbitron numbers
tick away and the advertisement contracts add up. We are
onceagain the losers. ‘K

It would probably be idealistic to think that the network
giants would give_us a break for once and let us have our cake
and eat it, too. This Sunday night, however, American view-
ers will be left to make another decision about what they
watch on television: the life and death of a great American
politician‘ and institution or the horrifying aftermaths of a
nuclear holocaust. _ ~

Maybe it would be better if everyone just watched “Archie
Bunker’s Place." .

Letters To The Editor

An Open LetterTo Pitt Fans  

/

Dear Editor:

This is an open letter to all Pitt
fans. On Oct. 1, Pitt lost a football
game in Morgantown, W.Va., by
less than one touchdown. Many
people, including their head coach,
felt that the difference in the game
was the support the Mountaineer
fans give their team by making a
tremendous amount of noise; every-
time Pitt was on offense the West
Virginia crowd succeeded in disrupt-
ing Pitt’s' signals, intimidating them
and the officials.

Despite the pleasjof John Con—_

gemi and the coaching staff, the offi-
cals allowed the crowd to control the
game, eventually resulting in a
missed signal and turnover which

_ was the turning point of the-game.

This Saturday Pitt plays Penn
State in a must game that will cer-
tainly have great- bearing in poll
position, bowl selection and the
Lambert Trophy. This is a team that
beat West Virginia by 18 points
coached by a man who thinks Pitt's
victory over Notre Dame was a
ﬂuke. This is the team thatcost Pitt a

National Championship in 1981 and
has had everything going its way the
past two years.
Let’s show our football team how
much we appreciate their efforts.
‘ Let’s make Pitt Stadium as difficult
a place for a visiting team to come in
as the Fitzgerald Field House is in
basketball. Let’s give the Panthers a
legitimate home-field advantage.
Let’s rock Pitt Stadium as it’s never
been before!
I Hail to Pitt! '

NOW In For A Big Surprise

Dear Editor:

The National Organization for‘
Women (NOW) is in for a big sur- ,

prise. It is counting on all the women
in America to band together under
NOW and vote Reagan out of office
in I984.

What NOW doesn’t realize is that

there may be a severe backlash_

against them for not only men, but
— heaven forbid — women. This
became evident to me in recent con-
versations I have had with different
women. Why is this the case?

NOW should seriously re-
evaluate itself and "decide if some
changes should be made within the
organization. I agree that its cause is
an excellent one. I think it’s shame-
ful that women are paid less then
men to do the same jobs. However, I
disagree with the way NOW is trying
to achieve its objectives.

NOW has thus far been.totally
ineffectual and is rapidly becoming
trite. This ineffectuality is evident
from the -Pennsylvania NOW con-
vention held here last weekend. It
seems -to be that NOW officials used

this-convention to point fingers and ~

sling mud but offered no! real solu-
tions. NOW has a severe public rela-

” tions problem. Its members come off

as bitter, mad-at-the-world people.
They should spend their time formu-

~ lating strategy rather than perform-

ing “cute” little skits that do nothing
but alienate women ‘and men who
are not members of their group. The
people at this convention made no
point through their stage produc-
tions; all they did was make asses of
themselves. Personally, I am rapidly
losing sympathy for NOW. Some
women, I’ve discovered, arelosing
sympathy as well. I found it interest-

ing that the NOW chapter represen- '

tatives, of the entire state of

Pennsylvania filled only half the .

room where the meeting was held.

NOW needs public support more
than anythingxl will not support
acerbic people- who try to demean
and belittle anyone who does not
agree with them 100 percent. Instead
of the hot-headed, spiteful emotion-
alism .bordering on the ridiculous
that they are resorting to, NOW
should clear its collective head and
come up with the new strategies —
ones that enlist public support, not
dissent. '

Computer Complaints

Dear Editor:

I would like to thank Dean
Schulman (College of Arts and
Sciences) for finally recognizing
and admitting that there are
problems in Pitt’s computer
science department. The prob-
lems are, as Dean Schulman
stated in his address to the CAS
council, “shortages of resources,
faculty and equipment” and
“shortages of class space in com-
puter science classes.”

There are. essentially three
main problems currently plagu-
ing the computer science
department:

0The number
faculty the department has;

0The number of declared com-
puter science majors there are;

they out-number the full-time '

faculty by approximately 50 to I;

.0The continually worsening
state of “system B” — due to
overcrowding.

I’m glad the dean has finally
recognized these problems. The
thing that troubles me is the way
in which he is trying to solve the
problems by “working with the

Registrar’s Office... he will try to -

increase the number of spaces
available for the more popular
computer courses.”

. The problems do not lie in the
Registrar’s Office. The problems

of full-time

lie, in the computer science
department itself. No “quick fix"
solution, like.increasing class
sizes, will help. Increasing com-
puter science class sizes will
further tax an already over-
worked faculty, lead to further
overcrowding of the university's
RJE sites, and probably double
or even triple system B's down
time as more and more students
are issued project—programmer
numbers. -

-There is only one, two-part
solution to these problems:

0A dramatic increase in the
computer science department’s
budget, so it can attract more
full-time faculty and add more
and better hardware and soft-
ware to its current holding.

OFunding for the development
of a separate computer system
for computer science majors use
exclusively — this would alle-
viate the overcrowding of the
current system.

The University of Pittsburgh
was once at the forefront of com-,
puter science, but if serious,
long-term solutions to the exist-
ing problems aren’t devised and
implemented quickly, ‘Pitt will
barely be in the background.

Thoughts At Large

‘What ever happened to Don .

By TOM JACOB

Did you ever wonder:

0Who some of those people
who walk aimlessly around var-
ious Pitt offices pretending to be
important and necessary are?

0How the people in television
,'news shows quickly find parking
places directly in front of build-
ings when it takes you 40 minutes
to locate a space seven blocks
from the Forbes Quadrangle? .

Olf you chose the right major"

after reading government fore-
casts indicating l0,000 jobs
opening up in your field and
150,000 people competing for
them? _

Olf you should have come to
college at all after reading a
government forecast indicating
no jobs opening up unless you’re
a computer science major?

01f the Cathedral of Learning’s
exterior was-alwayssuch a ding
color? ..

Drysdale and Sandy Koufax?

‘Why the people behind you
in the theater have nothing to say
to each other until the movie
begins?

0What President Reaganis
reaction would have been if the

Soviet Union had invaded Gre-.

nada under the pretense of eva-
cuating Russian medical
students?

0What Edward J. DeBartolo
doesn't own?

0Why the obnoxious, smelly
people always sit next to you on
the bus even though there are 20
other seats from which to
choose?

0Why, no matter which cash

register‘ you go to in a fast food
restaurant, someone yells from
the other end of the counter,
“Can I help you down here-?”?

"F0 recast: Anotherweary Winter

Lg;-9

  

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Despite the dropping tempera-
tures and falling flakes, weathermen
predict this year’s Pittsburgh winter
won’t be an unusually cold or warm
one.

Pittsburgh winters have been
known to hit extreme temperatures
in recent years. The coldest winter
the city has ever seen was in 1977,
with an average temperature of 11
degrees, and last winter was the
warmest in fifty years, with a high of
sixty-eight degrees on Christmas
Day!

The National Weather Service
predicts that ‘temperatures from
November through January will be a
little above the normal 30 degrees.
However, according to the Farmer's
Almanac, it will get progressively
colder through February and.
March. -

The snowfall for the coming win-
ter will be “considerably below” the
normal 45 inches, the Farmer's
Almanac said, but Robert Cleis of
National Weather Service said the
normal snowfall will be reached.

“We’ll probably come to our aver-
age,” Cleis said. “We had a very lean
year last year, but I don’t think we’ll
get two of those in a row.” '

About five or six inches of snow
fell last weekend, and ﬂakes have
been fluttering ever since. Ironically,
some areas around the Greater Pitts-
burgh area have not yet been hit at
all by snow.

The reason for this is that snow
often travels in.snowbands, two-to-
10 mile wide bands of snow that usu-
ally travel from the northwest to the
southeast, Cleis said. _Snowbands
follow each other, and the amount
of snow to fall can be calculated by
the thickness of the band.

‘We had a very lean
year last year, but I
don’t think we'll get
two of those in a

row. ’ t _
- Robert C/9/8,

National Weather
Service

Snowbands that rea_ch Pittsburgh
originate in Lake Erie and travel
through Ohio and New York as well
as Pennsylvania. ,

The state’s coldest winter was in
1904, when a record low of minus 42

degrees was recorded in Smethport.
At the time this--low was recorded,
weathermen hadn’t yet started cal-
culating the wind 'chill factor.

Both temperatures and wind
cause heat loss from the body sur-
face, according to the National
Weather Service, and the body feels
colder than the actual temperature
outside.

A temperature of 20 degrees plus

i 20-mile-per-hour winds would cause

a body heat loss equal to that of
minus 10 degrees if there were no
wind. Thus, the wind makes 20
degrees feel like minus 10.

Although the wind chill factor has
dropped pretty low in recent win-
ters, it’s a rare case when Pitt shuts
its doors to the wind.

The decision to cancel classis
made by top administrators, Helen

-Ahead

Knox, assistant to the chancellor,
said, and this has only happened
once or twice. When it does occur, it

is broadcast to the students through '

the media. 1

“It’s not just any little snowfall,”
said Knox.

For commuting students who
must travel to school in shivering
temperatures and through piles of
snow, Commuter Association presi-
dent’Marcia Anstandig advises them
to get bus schedules and leave a little
early, as snow often causes buses to

run late and makes driving difficult. ~

~ A To make your body feel warmer

when the wind chill sends chills up
your spine, it is advised that you eat

a little more heavily, drink warm li- _

quids, wear an extra layer of clo-
thing and find someone with whom

Seeing TheWorld On APIP Trip

By PAM CYGRYMUS

Pitt’s Informal Program (PIP)

sponsors a variety of domestic and-

international trips each year, and
according to the travelers, the trips
are worth the price.

Janet Szelong, a pre-law student
at Duquesne, borrowed the money
to go on the Orient Express train
trip. Named after the Agatha Chris-
tie mystery novel, this train stops in

London, Paris, Milan, Florence,

Venice and Rome for $2,400.

The size of the groups going on
PIP trips is small, which makes the
trips more personalized. Betty
Goodwin, PIP’s Study Trip Coordi-
nator, said the travelers get to know
each other and become friends.

PIP offers about forty trips a year,
Goodwin said, and the cost of each
trip includes the necessary land and
air transportation, hotel accommo-
dations, taxes and service charges,
admissions and sight-seeing tours.

Trips may also have some meals
included in the cost.

Judy Breedlove, a tax paralegal
with Alcoa, has been on five PIP-
sponsored theater trips in the past
three years, she said the cost is reaso-
nable for the quality of the trips.

According to Szelong, the accom-
modations are excellent and almost
always convenient to the city. Flor-

ence was the only city in which the

accommodations were on the out-
skirts of town, she said, causing
some inconvenience.

Breedlove, a traveler on the Shaw-
Stratford Theatre trip, said the trips
are “well organized” and that PIP
makes available “everything.” Most
of the trips include a pre—trip lecture
to brief the travelers about the itin-
ery’s and what they may need to take
along. The PIP host also leads group
discussions during the trip.

Hosts include Dr. Christopher
Rawson, a member of Pitt’s English

Department and WQED Drama

Critic, also known for his knowledge
of the arts. Rawson has escorted

Dr. Robert Nossen, associate pro-
vost, has also escorted groups to the
Shaw-Stratford festival in Canada.

Not many students in the l8 to 22
age bracketgo on the trips, but,
Goodwin attributes this mostly to
lack of funds; many older students,
however, do go on the trips.

Although funds may be a prob-
lem, age is no barrier. For example,
five children are going along on an
African photo-safari that leaves
next Friday.

Chartered trips to such places as
the Virgin Islands, Martinique,
Florida, and Las Vegas can also be
booked through PIP. A chartered
trip to Marrakech is offered for $599
and includes round-trip airfare, land
transportation to and from the air-
port, deluxe hotel accommodations,
a continental breakfast each morn-
ing, service charges. ,

Airfare to Marrakech, according
to Nigerian Airlines, costs more
than the whole cost of the PIP char-
tered trip.

.Nancy Spungen:  

AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
THIS LII-‘E

By DEBORAH SPUNGEN

Villard Books

Nancy Spungen, American punk
celebrity and live-in lover of the Sex
Pistols’ Sid Vicious, was found one
October morning under a bathroom

{sink in the Chelsea Hotel, clad only in
black lace underwear with a hunting ,
knife in her abdomen. She was pro-

nounced dead at the age of. 20.
Vicious, charged with murdering her,
was freed on bail and attempted sui-
cide twice before 5he finally suc-
ceeded, .o.d.-ingv on heroin a few
months later.

Nancy Spungen didn't look like the

kind of girl who'd grown up in a nor- .

mal American family, nor did she act

‘like one. Her notoriousnessbrought ,

unwanted fame and anguish upon
her family, who were constantly
harassed by the media from the time
Nancy moved in with Vicious until
long after she had died. Nancy had
caused her family pain since the day
she was born, ..and, ironically, it didn't
stop with her death.
In order to put herself, and her

I family, at peace, Debbie Spungen,

Nancy's mother, wrote And I Don't
Want To Live This Life. She tells her

. version of the Nancy Spungen saga ,
— a mother's version. She begins

with Nancy's birth, an unplanned

 

with enthusiasm nonetheless. But
the problems‘ began the moment
Nancy came home from the hospital;
the infant screamed incessantly and
slept only from exhaustion. Doctors
were consulted, but all told the Spun-
gens that their child was just going
through a phase that would pass. The
”phase" lasted the entire length of
Nancy's life. _'

When Nancy was a toddler, she

attacked a phone repairman; when
she was barely 11, she tried to kill her
mother with a hammer. Her teen-age
years were spent in special schools
that were supposedto help curb her
behavior; instead, she became
involved with casual sex, violence,
and drugs. By now, the Spungens
marriage was hanging by a thread
and the lives of their other two child-
ren had suffered. They had no choice
but to stop listening to the so-called

”experts" and kicked Nancy out of
their household. ‘

A move to New York turned Nancy
onto heroin, and a move to London
saw her as the high priestess of the
punk culture. She seemed happy for
the first time in her life — her
”achievement” of becoming a glori-
fied groupie (she later claimed to have
married Sid Vicious, though no evi-
dence supporting this exists) made
her proud. But domestic punk bliss
was doomed from the beginning;
Vicious had the same kind of violent,

erratic personality as Nancy's, and

the same need to blot out life's reality
through drug dependency. Friends

reported that the two fought con-

stantly and both had the scars to
prove it. Although. Vicious main-
tained until his death that he didn't
kill her —— his past behavior and the
fact that his fingerprints werefound
on the knife proved‘ him guilty.

And I Don't Want To Live This Life is a
powerful, sensitive story about a girl
who couldn't be helped, even by the
supposed cure-all of a loving and sup-
portive family. Debbie Spungen’s
writing is often painful to read, due in

part to her obvious personal involve- .

ment and her honesty in revealing
the true nature of her daughter's per-
sonality. But And I Don't Want To Live
This Life is fascinating. reading, as
absorbing as its parallel, last year's

DOLLY AND THE NANNY BIRD
By Dorothy Dunnett

‘Vintage Books

Joanna Emerson, trained as profes-

sional governess, is Dorothy Dun- ,-

nett's unlikely heroine in her latest
mystery, Dally and the Nanny Bird.
Joanna becomes a reluctant nanny to
Benedict Booker-Readman — the
child of very spoiled parents and the
target of bizarre kidnapping

‘ attempts. Time and time again, the
 kidnappers fail to capture the child,
' leaving Joanna and company ques-

tioning the true motives for the plot.

If it sounds like the perfect nap-
time story, prepare for a pleasant sur-
prise. Dunnett has successfully
woven together the world of interna-
tional spies and secret codes with the

safe one of baby formulas and diap-

ers. Joanna works as a narrator

because she fits in well with both ,

worlds. Besides working as a nanny,

. she has helped her ‘former employer

with some confidential government
work. After he had been murdered,
Joanna stayed away from both bottles
and guns until her friend and protec-
tor, Johnson Johnson — a small, bifo-
caled man who is always in the right
place at the right time — arranges her
meeting with the Booker-Readmans.
Johnson's yacht, the Dolly, provides
the other half of the title.

The book is filled with other color-
ful characters — a spy posing as a
plant doctor whose hobby is hockey; a
health-nut toy manufacturer; a'play—
ful Yugoslavian who designs toys and
builds castles; and more. And Joanna
is no Maria Von Trapp herself. She's
sarcastic and strong and can even sail
yachts through life-threatening
storms.- To discover the true intent
behind the kidnapping attempts,
Joanna can trust no one, but she

I befriends everyone she encounters.

Ultimately, she allows Benedict and
herself to be kidnapped.

A feeling of safety permeates the
book even when Joanna is in serious
trouble —- the reader never becomes
too frightened or worried about her.

Like James Bond, she walks away
from it all without a scratch, and the
only dead people are the bad guys.

‘ Most mysteries have that element in

them, but this one does to a stronger
degree because its I characters are
nannies, children and toy designers.

The strength of the novel lies more

‘in Dunnett’s plot. Even when Joanna

—— and consequently, the reader —
thinks the mystery is solved, Dun-
nett comes up with yet another twist.
If you're loking for a light mystery
with colorful action and plot, Dolly and
the Nanny Bird is for you. I

DINA LARDAS

REEFER MADNESS
Larry Soloman

' Grove Press

Oh, come on. Isn't marijuana a
dead issue? And isn't the cover of this

i book a bit sensational? Here we have

a man standing amongst 10-foot high
marijuana plants, wearing a menac-

ting looking ski mask, holding a pitch-

fork in one hand and an M-16 in the
other. This is not exactly your

friendly neighborhood dope’ dealer. ,

Andlhow much/ faith can you give to
the author when you find out he's
editor in chief of High Times?

OK, the cover is terrible, the
author is suspect —- now what about
the book? Not bad! And remember,
this is comin_g from someonewho
was mighty skeptical of the whole
thing. Soloman's Reefer Madness jour-
neysthrough the history of pot in
America and emerges as a fairly
entertaining piece of work.

The first two thirds of the book are
given over to the marijuana’s climb
from a recreational drug used mainly
by jazz and blues artists of New York

and New Orleans to its present infil- ‘

tration into nearly every class and
every state of the union.

Among the less interesting of these
chapters are those that deal with
long-time Bureau of Narcotics chief
Harry Aslinger. While the book does
an excellent job of pointing out Aslin-

ger's rather paranoid and often time I

bizarre fears of marijuana, at the
same time it bogs down with long
recountings of his old’ congressional
hearings. ‘

The last third of the book is com-

" pletely enjoyable. In this section, Sol-

oman sits back,. turns on the
microphone and offers breezy inter-

views with a variety of people who,

are involved to various. degrees with
pot. These chapters are quick,- fun
reading chapters, filled with 70-year-
old couples who got stoned and went
to see Guy Lombardo, paraphenalia
tycoons, rich but lonely dealers,
brownie-eating mothers and so on.
Soloman has treated his subject
fairly, which is not easy to do when
dealing with marijuana. And while
the book does imply that marijuana
laws“ are a bit absurd, it thankfully
refrains from preaching this mes-
sage. Overall, Reefer Madness is a very
enjoyable book. If only Soloman
would have given the reader more of
what. he seems to do best —— the inter-
view — the book would have been
even more worthwhile. '

IN CONSTANT FLIGHT
By Elizabeth Tallent

Alfred A. Knopf

In Constant Flight, a collection of 11
stories (several of which appear in The
New.Yorlcer), is Elizabeth Tallent’s first

book. The setting is the contempor- -

ary American West; the stories’ char-
acters are often unconventional
academics and artists. Often, the
charactezis tell in a nostalgic. but

  
     

quietly [humorous tone of how they J .

left. or were left by someone they
loved.

In ”Natural Law,” a man describes
his ambitious wife, who leaves him to
pursue her career as a ballet dancer in
New York. He stays behind in Albu-
querque, where he works inside a
giant papier-mache dinosaur as part of a
used-car lot's promotional gimmick.
His wife calls him to ask, ”Are you
going to trudge around inside papier-
mache until you are 30.7" She wants
him to come after her, and he wants
her, but he is reluctant to leave the
safety and pseudo-power of his dino-
saur suit.

There are no clean breaks between
the young lovers in these stories. In
”Keats," a woman leaves her husband
in Cheyenne for a lover in San Fran-
cisco, but she longs for the pet dog

she left behind. When’ she phones .

home to negotiate with her husband
for custody of the dog, her husband
lets her know how much he misses
and needs her; but after "every call,
the woman yearns more for the dog.
The dog becomes asymbol for the
part of her that is inextricable from‘

. her and her husband's past.

In understated but often beauti-
fully poetic language, Tallent builds

. powerful images of her characters’

troubled communication. In ”Ice," a
mother cannot overcome her disap-
proval of her daughter's work as a
skater in the Travelling Ice Show.

" After seeing the show, she ‘tells her

daughter, ”I did like it when you went
into those pirouettes. If I squinted‘, I
didn't really have to see the ice. I only
saw you, and it looked as if you were

J dancing by yourself instead of with

that bear." I

All the stories stress the mystery of
why one chooses a particular person,
place or thing over another. Every
choice of something new entails the
loss of something old. Tallent’s sto-
ries elegantly depict both the neces-
sity and the frailty of human
communion.

  Steve

BACK

 

By MARK MARTINI

In the midst of recession, inflation

and invasions, true happiness is a rare
p thing. But not for Steve Walsh. The

former lead vocalist/keyboard player

for Kansas says "I'm in the group I've

always wanted to be in," in reference’
Vto his new group, Streets.

After 10 extremely successful
years, Walsh left Kansas in 1981 to
form his own band. "If everything
were going smoothly, I would still be
ridin’ the wave," Walsh says. "But
everything wasn't going smoothly.
Things were -stagnating politically,
musically...The music took aback
seat to a lot of of other things...It was
going on for years, literally. It was
like a sigh of relief when I quit: I
mean, everybody went ’What.7!!' and
then went 'Thank God, that's over
with.’ It wasilike that for everybody,
me and the group." '

But themajor reason for Walsh's
departure was his need for "artistic
freedom,” as he calls it. "There were
too many people to write for in the
group — there were six of us. I was
longing to write for a guitar, bass and
drums with some vocals over it
[respectively, Mike Slamer, Billy
Greer, Tim Gehrt and Walsh of
Streets], and how am I going to leave
two people out of the picture alto-
gether?" he asks."'It was dictating the
way I wrote, and I felt that for a long
time, and it just wasn't the way I felt
anymore. At one time I did...But

. things happen...people change...And
you know, the public might not real-
ize it, and they might say, ‘Hey, you
really fucked up, you really let us

Walsh    
ON 1: STREETS

down 'cause you quit that group.’ But
that's not it at all, 'cause I'm in it to
make music."

To Walsh, the most important
aspect of the music he makes is the
realistic attitude that he wants it to
project, He says that even the selec-
tion of the band's name was carefully
done with that attitude in mind. "We
came about that name off of a song-
that we recorded that isn't on our
first album but will probably be on
our second. album called 'Streets of

Desire,’ " Walsh explains. "We wrote ~

about 30 songs for this "album and
narrowed it down to nine, which was
a tough thing to do in itself. And out
of that, we had to pick a lot of things
— attitude for one — we wanted to
write about. We had to communicate
something as a whole, not just as four
individuals, but as a group.

"The thing that kept sticking ‘out to
us about the group was that we were
s-peaking about realistic situations
and realistic character studies —
things that would and could happen.
‘And so, since the real situations were
there, we decided to call ourselves
something real, something tangible,
and so-we decided on that name, basi-
cally because...to put it in a nutshell,
it was a name that nobody hated in
the group...And Streets is a name

‘that we can keep defining...It's not
already defined, like 'The Dead
Kennedys,' " he laughs, " 'cause when
you think of that group, you know,
you think of a particular attitude.
And.Streets we can define over a five-
or six—album period."

Walsh's desire to get away from the

fantasy element of Kansas is most

"SI-IOWCASE, Friday, November 18, I983

: Billy Greer, Tim Gehrt, Mike Slamer and Steve Walsh.

Streets (1-r)

evident in his songwriting motiva-
tion and his selection of material for
the group's album. "You get to the
end of writing the music for a song,
and everybody goes, 'Well, now all we
need is words.’ " he says. "So you just
kinda start writing. For me, it just
lays a lot into your imagination —
what you want to write about, how
you want things t_o be directed.
"Like I said, we wrote a lot for this
album. Threw some songs out that.
didn't make any sense being on the
first album becausejwe ‘wanted to

-present ourselves in a direct attitude.

We had two slow /songs that both

_ were going to go on the album at one

time, and we wound up with neither
of them going on just because we
didn't want a track like that being

"played off the first album...That's

really not where we're at," he says,
continuing, "to me, it was somewhat
like the same thing when 'Dust in the
Wind’ became big for Kansas. People
came. [to concerts] just to seeithat
song, and when they heard other
things we were doing, they just
scratched their heads and went,

'What the hell is this stuff?’ you-

know, 'How come there isn't more of
this "Dust in the Wind" business?’

» People got totally wrong impressi-

ons...So we tried to direct all of our
songs vocally to communicate and to
define ourselves personality-wise but
yet not be redundant and talk about
the same things, you know? The ‘boy
meets girl’ situation in every song —
it doesn't really exist." ' .

Walsh's change in musical style is
accompanied by a change in record

companies. He says he's happier to be I

   

making his music at Atlantic rather

. than at Kirshner Records (Kansas'»

label). "They're on our side," Walsh
explains. "Kirshner’s label was born
from a publishing company; Atlan-
tic's label is born from rock-n-roll."
And that's what they promote —
their bands. It was the wrong atmos-
phere ‘at Kirshner. It was doomed
from the very beginning."

The origin of Streets had its prob-
lems, too -— "Money," says Walsh.
"See, I've been out of the band [Kan-
sas] for two years...Tim and I have

been together for two years — Mike 

and Billy and Tim and I have been
together for a year and a half. It's
taken eight months to get the record
companyon paper.

"But everything that's worthwhile
takes a while," concludes Walsh, phi-

. losophically. "We knew this from the

beginning — we just didn't realize
how long it took...We've gone
through a manager already, and now
we've got Derek Sutton, who used to
manage Styx, who is probably the
best manager in the business as far as
I'm concerned. And we have the best
label in the business as far as I'm con-
cerned, and the road crew's happen-
ing. So it just took a lot of time to get
together, and money was the main
obstacle. But I wouldn't have said this
at the time, but I'm kind of glad that
we went through some bad times

because now, just playing in front of 2;,

those crowds, I mean, Derek comes
out on the road and he says, 'What
the (hell's everybody smiling about?

_You're only playing, like, a 700- or

"800-seat hall!’ It's just great to "play.

Stephanie Mills

LIVING IN Dl

By LISA LAVALLE

Stephanie Mills found fame on the
Yellow Brick Road of Broadway in
The Wiz at the tender age of 16 ——— the
same age that most of us are excited
about getting driver's licenses.

Such instant success is not unheard
of, yet like many stars before her, she
had already put in several years of
work toward that success. In fact, the
Brooklyn—born singer/actress had
her first big break at the age of 11,
when shewon the talent contest at
Harlem's legendary Apollo Theatre.
Actually, her Broadway debut was
not in The Wiz but came years earlier
in the show Maggie Flynn, with Shirley
Jones and the late Jack Cassidy.

”My brother read an ad in the paper
saying they needed nine black kids to
come down and audition for Maggie
Flynn, "I went down and auditioned. I
sang and danced and got the part.”

Yet it was the premiere of The Wiz
in 1975 that made Stephanie Mills a
household name. For four years on
Broadway, she played the original
Dorothy in the black rendition of L.
Frank Baum’s classic, "The Wizard of
Oz."

”The casting director heard one of
my songs on the radio and called to
see if I'd be interested in playing

Dorothy," Mills said. ”I had three A

auditions; all of them were private —
and they all went very well.”

I Mill's Broadway career was not the
only thing that blossomed for her.
Following a glorious four—year run,
she began an entirely new career as a

recording artist. Many Broadway
stars had tried to make the crossover
from theater to recording and failed,
finding along the way that success on
stage did not necessarily guarantee
success as a recording artist. Mills
believes that she is a successful
recording artist because ”I like a good
song! I don't like messages behind a
song; I'm not into politics. I just like to
sing happy songs."

Although her recording career has
been successful, Mills has returned to
the theater because ”Presently, I
think that theater is kinda hot. If you
look at all the people doing it, it's
sorta the ’in’ thing to do. But that is
not why I'm doing it,” she said. ”I've
recorded and have been on the road
with my own shows and, well, they
offered me a deal I just couldn't
refuse.”

Undeniably, Mills is a woman of
many talents. Earlier this year, she
appeared for two weeks on NBC-TV
daytime serial ”Search for Tomor-
row," which she says was a learning
experience of a lifetime.

"It was quite different to work on
TV because those actors come in
every day and learn the script and
then do it right there on camera,” she
said. ”I was not used to that, but eve-

ryone was very helpful."

In addition to being involved’ in
theater, singing’ and TV, Mills would
like an opportunity to be in films. ”I’d
like to do movies, but I haven't been
offered anything I really want to do,"
she said. However, Mills did hint that
something was in the making.

Strangely enough, Millswas not
offered the part of Dorothy in the
movie version of The Wiz (a role that
went to Diana Ross instead). This
was actually a blessing in disguise

since the movie was both a critical ‘

and commercial disaster.

Returning to her recording career,
Mills’ current album, Merciless has hit
a hi‘. single, "Pilot Error,” that is
rapidly climbing the charts. She likes
to record but finds that the record

industry is changing dramatically.

”I have to record an album every
eight [her manager corrects her],
every six months because with the
music and everything around you
changing so often, you have to be out
there. People must know that you are
still consistent with your music,” she
said. A

. Currently, artists have a great deal
of creative control, and the new trend
in music is videos. However, Mills
does not see videos as a cure for the

Page l3_

record industry 5 problems.

”I have done a video for ’Pilot
Error,’ and it's getting a lot of air-
play," she said, ”but I don't think
video is as hot now; its popularity is
beginning to slack off." Mills added,

”Sometimes you don videos and they .

might improve record sales slightly,
but people might not come to see you
live because they see too many or too
much of your videos.

”What if you're not as good as your
video?” she asked.

Nonetheless, with or without
videos, Stephanie Mills continues to
open new doors and has already
achieved much during her career. She
has won a Grammy and an American
Music Award and also had the honor‘:
of performing at The White House,
for Presidents Reagan and Carter.

_Mills' is content with the fame she ‘
found on the Yellow Brick Road and
sums it up by saying, ”Finally, I am

‘beginning to express Stephanie!”- _

At last! Here, finally is the last
live show Bowie ever performed
behind the persona of "Ziggy

- Stardust,” after which he broke

up the original Ziggy bandjand
entered one of his "retire-
ments." Recorded on July 3,
1973, at the I-Iainmersmith
Odeon in London, this concert
(which was broadcast on one of
the '70s’ rock TV shows way

back when) was“ previously‘

available in an edited form taken.
f-rom the TV show only on a
rare bootleg called His Master's
Voice which some of us were
smart enough to buy years ago
when it was around. But here is
the real thing, remixed by
Bowie himself.

‘ What a package! Ziggy-era
stuff like "Moonage Day-
dream,” ’’Hang on to Yourself,”
and "Suffragette City” smoke

and meld perfectly with an ethe-

AND ROLL ORCHESTRA
‘Paul Kantner

RCA

Fair warning to E.T., Luke
Skywalker, George Lucas,
Steven Spielberg and friends:
Paul Kantner's Planet Earth Rock
and Roll Orchestra may be coming
soon to a theater near you.

Adventure and escape are the
most popular themes of

Kantner’s new album: "Mr,

Sagan wont’cha/ Tell me if
we're ever gonna get off this
planet alive” in the title track;."I
want to go with her” in ”Tele-
path"; "Great migrations” in
"Mount Shasta”; "Fly fly fly
silver boy” in "Lilith's Song";
"they're coming after me” in

"Science Friction”; "Gonna
make the mountains be my
home” in "The Mountain
Song”; "Lemme go Lemme run
run run" in "The Sky Is No

v Limit”; and the last song is
appropriately entitled, of-

course, "Let's Go.”

But there's no need to escape
from this album because, fortu-
nately, the obscure ideas of
Kantner's forthcoming novell

/llladin Sane songs like "Cracked
Actor" and "Watch That Man,"
older Bowie favorites like
"Width of a Circle" and
"Changes," and rarities like
Jacques Brel’s "My Death" and
the Velvet Underground's
"White Light/White Heat."
Then, tofinish off an amazing
show, Bowie solemnly announ-
ces: "This is the last show that
we'll ever do," and goes right
into, what else? "Rock And Roll
Sucide." Yow!

Of course, this record is an
absolute must for Bowiephiles,
even for those who already have
the aforementioned bootleg, as
there's different stuff here.
(The only thing the bootleg
offers that this album A sadly
doesn't is a version of "Jean
Genie" (with Jeff Beck) that
segues into "Love Me Do"; but
contracts will rule in the corpo-
rate rock world}. .

which have a Starship-ish
sound, at times even recalling

No great shock — a glance at
the album's credits reveals that
it really isn't a solo effort on
Kantner's part: in addition to
Kantner on guitars, synthesiz-
ers, banjo, glass harmonica,
vocals and most of the music
and lyric credits, all of the cur-
rent members of the Jefferson

(Craig Chaquico, lead guitar; _

Pete Sears, piano; Aynsley Dun-

bar, drums; Mickey Thomas,

vocals; and David Freiberg, syn-
thesizer and vocals).

But the Best Performance
Award goes to Grace Slick, who
perhaps has never sounded bet-

the story's heroine, the witch
Lilith, who Kantner describes as
”strong,” adding that Slick "ful-

...AND A TIME TO DANCE
Los Lobos '
Slash '

It's damn shocking to hear an
accordion used as a rock-n-roll

instrument, especially on the

first cut of side one. Nonethe-
less, that is the case on ...And A
Time To Dance, the Slash debut by
Los Lobos. Strangely enough,
after the initial shock has worn
off, the second reaction is to
dance to this remarkably origi-
nal EP. _

Since _1974, Los Lobos have
been inventing their sound,
which combines the bare-bones
style of '50s rock-n-roll with the
traditionalism of the members’
Chicano ancestry. Theproduct
defies categorization but is
probably the closest rock will
ever get to the polkascene.

Of course, polkas are meant
for dancing, and that's what Los
Lobosseem to be after. They
want the feet to move, and they

do an admirable job on this,
, seven-song mini-LP. The tunes

basically. deal with broken
hearts and promises from a Mex-
icano's point-of_-view. In fact,
"Anselma" and "Ay Te Dejo En
San Antonio" are sung in the
n,ative'tongue and when trans-
lated, reveal a western bravado
that hasn't been sung about
since Pancho Villa rode the

. p’a‘mpasT

Ironically, though, it is Los
Lobos’ cover of Ritchie Valens’
"Come On Let's Go” that is the
high point of the EP. On this
tune, the boys come off sound-
ing like the Blasters can salsa —
it's some real zest from the past."

...And A Time To Dance is a dar-
ing package of music that spar-
kles with innovation but still
manages to mind its roots. Los
Lobos’ artistry isn't contrived
novelty — it's an attempt to
blend Chicano culture with the
beat of popular music, and it
works.

NATIONAL VEMOTION I

 V Columbia

Side One: , .

First you wonder if it's the
wisest thing in the world to
start an album with a song
entitled "Dumb But Pretty";
isn't it kind of insulting to admit
that you're excited by a girl
whom you describe as not smart
but not ugly? "Someday Will
Come" offers a bit of sentimen-
tal hope, both lyrically and liter-
ally, but just when you think
you may be rescued, along

v ‘comes ”Laverne,” in which the

"harmonies are either interest-
ing or aggravating, depending
on your level of tolerance.

And as the needle works its
way across the disc, you wonder
what ever happened to the guy
who crooned so convincingly to
a girl named Jenny over the tele-
phone. You just don't seem to
recognize him anymore.

Side Two:

No, the record isn't warped,
but the guitarist who thought
up the opening chord might be,

because that's what the riff

sounds like. The second song,
"Monday Talks," is forsaken on
the inside jacket, which causes
the loss of brownie. points by
confusing the devout lyric
reader. "Imaginary Heart” is
another bright spot, but you
won't be fooled like you were on

continued from page fourteen
thelflip side. You're still not won
over. . 1

Actually, what we have here
is sort of contemporary, urban
version of Southern rock that
doesn't stick cleanly to one con-
viction or_the other to satisfy

either set of fans. The result: V

music to nod off by. Try as one
might to pay attention, it's not
long before you start thinking
about your laundry or your next
doctor's appointment.

The biggest mistake of the
album is the paradox of its title.
The tunes inside are about as
emotional as the cover photo
showing the musicians propped
blankly in front of the TV and
about as unique as the generic
beer and chips they're consum-
ing. Tommy and the boys ought
to work on a sense of personal
emotion before they set out to
_rile up the nation.

SUZANNE GRIECO

SONS OI-' HEROES
Sons of Heroes
MCA/Ripple

Just the facts, ma'am: three
members comprise the group in
question — Carmelo Luggeri,
Geoff Grange "and Terry Tay-
lor. The albumunder considera-

_tion is their first, consisting of
10 songs written by them (with
help from Pete Sinfield on
three). Rolling Stone Bill
Wyman produced’ and plays on
one track.

Now. Some other points to
consider: 1) they call themselves
Sons of Heroes, which gives
nepotism a bad name. Isn't it
flawed logic to assume that if
Dad did all right, then his offsp:
ring are equally talented? 2)
They sound something like Lov-
erboy, plus keyboards and
minus the rough edges, or
maybe Journey with a lower-
pitched singer. But do we need
another of either of these? 3)
The songs have titles like ”Liv-
ing Outside Your Love,” "All
Broke Up” and ”Don’t Make It
So Hard” with ”meaningful”
lyrics to match. 4) Here is a sam-
ple lyric: ”I got a hot kiss from a
cold miss/I got a hot kiss —-— now
you're my property." Cross my
heart; it's the chorus of ”Hot

Kiss.” 5) The song ”Dream*

Machines" is about video
games. 6) The music is the sort
about which a publicist would
say "Strong Pop/Rock _With
Tough Yet Tender Vocals," and

there's not a memorable song in L

the batch. 7) The best that can
be said about the effort as a
whole while. remaining polite is
”so—so." Or ”bland” might suf-
fice. 8) The album isdedicated to
”Heroes, Past, Present &
Future.” Huh?

All right,‘ to be fair, the posi-
tive aspects: 1) one of the songs,
”Start of the Human Race," fea-
tures a pretty good tune. 2)
”l.ove Insight,” the one Bill
Wyman ‘provides basslines for,
has a neat instrumental break
near the end. 3) "Lost in Won-
derland” is sort of-like funk, and
if you wanted, you could proba-
bly dance to it. 4) The album's
cover picture is really excellent.

Weigh the evidence; the deci-
sion is yours. On the bright side,
though, Sons of Heroes» have
nowhere to go but up, unless

they brought their shovels. ‘

Suppose we give their album a
”miss” and see —what happens
next time, all right?

ls   Spikers’ Next Phase Within Reach?  

By LAURIE KUBLI

A championship season.

The phrase has been on the tip of ,
Pitt women’s volleyball coach Shel-
ton Collier’s tongue for time
immemorial, as persistent as a
November drizzle. -

Often sought but seldom grasped,
the Big East Conference crown is
within reach of the Lady Panthers, '
who will be defending that title at

. Providence, R.I., this weekend.

The spikers, who wound up the
regular season with 27 wins against
I0 defeats, are hoping to rebound
from last weekend’s loss at Penn
State and begin Phase II» of their
season.

“Our team has a long way to go to
get better, but we’re not ready for
our season to be over this weekend,”

Collier asserted. The coach expects
the team to win its three matches on
Saturday and go on to the semi-final
and final matches on Sunday, both
of which are single elirfiinatilon-.

This‘ year’s squad Iaéks the depth
of experience and leadership that ’
seniors contribute, but four juniors
fill that vacancy handily.

Pat Belcher is a third-year athlete
from South Bend, Ind., who has
seen limited court time due to off-
season knee surgery but whose pres-
ence on the court is always felt.

“Our team is a strong team when
Pat is available,” Coach Collier
remarked, “which she will be this
weekend. Pat's primary responsibil-
ity is to block the other team’s top
spiker. We expect to meet Provi-
dence in the finals, and Pat will more
than likely be matched against Trish

O’Brian, one of Providence’s return-
ing first-team All-Big East
selections.”

“I wonder how good Pat would be
without the limitations on her’
knees,” Collier said thoughtfully.

Belcher says the team has had
some of it’s best practices of the sea-
son and this weekend anticipates a
tough match against Providence.

“I think it’ll be a dogﬁght all the
way,” said Collier.

Pitt’s only returning member
named to All-Big East is 5-1 I middle
blocker Ulana Kolutiak, whom Col-
lier maintains should be the top
spiker at the tournament. “If Ulana
plays up to her capabilities, we will
be in a good positionto win the tour-
nament,” he said. _

4 Setter Cathy Rupp agrees with
Collier . on the likelihood of Pitt

meeting Georgetown, a team the
Lady Panthers have defeated twice
this year in the semi-ﬁnals. The
Hoyas also lost to Pitt in last sea-
son’s Big East ﬁnals. I

- “I think this will be a more emo-
tional match for them,” Rupp pre-
dicted. “However, we’ve been
preparing for this weekend, and
they'll be only as big an obstacle as
we make them.”

Collier believes Rupp to be the

i best all-around athlete on the team,

noting the effectiveness of her knuc-
kleball serve. “Her dynamic topspin
serve has been a big factor in us win-
ning or losing this year,” he said.
Rupp credits her high school
coach for motivating her to perform
with intensity and being a primary
factor in the development of her
powerful serve. Char Sharp, last

, her players,” according to .Rupp, a e I

year’s high school coach of the year, I
“knows how to get the most out of

5-8 transfer from Ohio University.

Pitt utilized two setters in its“ 

offense, Rupp and team captain
Judy Young. A 5-7 pharmacy major
from Conneaut Lake, Pa., Young
played on both the 1981 and .1982

championship teams, according to v

Collier. . »
“Judy is quietly effective and con-
tinually adapting to the challenge of

taking on additional responsibilities '

of setter and captain in addition to
spiking chores,” he said.’

“I will expect heffo be the number
one left side hitter at- the tourna-
ment,” Collier asserted. The coach
does not forget the ankle injury that
has hampered her this season_b_ut

It turned iritoa nightmare for

country and had an offensive field
day.

Another loss, 42-34, and the Lion
defense was in a lot of trouble.

It was time to re-evaluate the‘
defense, the" team's supposed
stronghold entering the season.

“Those first three games
[Nebraska, Cincinnati and Iowa]
were a learning experience for all of
us,” Radecic said. “It was tough to
take. It threw us out of whack.

“More importantly, a lot of the‘

players on the team were question-
ing their own_talents. Whenever you

beat, you have to begin questioning
yourself.”

The ‘team, through its leaders,
dealt with the frustration.

“After the Iowa game, we made it
our goal to win the remaining nine‘

games," Radecic said. “Right now,
we’re seven out of eight, and this_

Saturday we’re gonna make it eight
out of nine.”

Though the defense has been far
from staunch, it has come together
enough to help beat three teams that
have been ranked in the Tops 10 -
Alabama, West Virginia and Notre
Dame.

The win over WVU proved to be

played with the intensity of Lion
units of past seasons.

Though their performance a week
ago against Notre Dame was sus-
pect, they came up with the big play
when they needed it. Their play in
conjunction with the Strang-led
offense held off the Irish, 34-30.

The team is still much maligned,
mainly the defense, which is yielding
428.9 yards per game (178.5 rushing

and 250.5 passing). entering Satur-

day’s game with Pitt.

Radecic is coming off his finest
effort of the season, a I0-tackle per-
formance against the Irish in which

he garnered the “Defensive Player ‘of .

Down To Pitt Stopping Strang, His Receiver Fleet

QUARTERBACK

' From this pole, whoever moves
his team better from inside the 20
will lead his team to 9-2 or 8-4. Pitt’s
John “Ace” Congemi, an unknown
quantity and quality out of fall
camp,gwas given his chance in the
second game, against Temple, and
has never looked back since.

Currently, his stats speak ll8-
213-I315 sentences, blemished by
six interceptions in completing over
55 percent of his passes. Despite his
early season scoring malaise, Con-
gemi has _shown in the last couple of
weeks that Pitt can actually ﬁnd the
rectangular box at either end of the
field.

The Panthers do, too, have the
luxury of relying on another secret,
sophomore Chris Jelic. After wait-
ing patiently six weeks beforehand,
Jelic entered the second half of the
Notre Dame game and provided, in
part, the winning edge for Pitt’s big-
gest win to date.

For Penn State, Doug Strang,
right out of the Todd Blackledge
mold (first-round draft pick, Kansas
City Chiefs), possesses a strong arm,
is mobile and is not inhibited about
running the‘~ball. His advantage.over
Congemi comes in more easily lead-
ing his receivers to TDs, with 17
passing strikes so far.

That, of Course, has been aided by
a tight end who should passfor a
wide out, Dean Dimidio, ﬂanker
All-America Kenny Jackson and
underrated split end Kevin Baugh.
More on these gazelles later.

A junior who was benched and

demoted to third string after the t

Nebraska fiasco, Strang received
head coach Joe Paterno’s'_vote of
confidence two weeks later and
responded with 254 passing yards
and three TDs against Iowa. Now
Strang has accumulated I698 yards
on 120 of 236 completions.

Strang has come up big in the big
games, especially against Alabama,
West Virginia and Notre Dame. But
the nuisance remains in that he has
no viable backup. Fellow junior
Dan Lonergan has been a bust after
seeing time against. the Cornhuskers
and proving ineffective as a starter

against Cincinnati. ‘

With Strang’s facing a high-
voltage Pitt pass rush and Conge-
,mi’s getting accustomed to hitting
his tight ends and new flanker, call
this one a toss-up.

TAILBACK

, From the‘ tailback slot, both
teams have bona fide tractors who
can find the holes. Back on Sept. 25,
about the time Pitt’s Joe McCa‘ll
nursed a strained calf muscle, fresh-
man D.J. Dozier emerged from the
Meadowlands against Rutgers with
his third straight I00-yard-plus
game ( 196) and already accumulated
456 on 6.1 per handoff.

Now Dozier has 992-yards, is still
getting 6.1 yards per carry and is all
the more frightening since he never
even showed up on Penn State’s pre-
season depth chart. Being a Virginia
native, recruited by Rosie Greer,

Pitt will likely offer him a joltingt

initiation to this annual rivalry.
On the other side ofthe coin is one
all too familiar with it, McCall. The
6-1, I90-lb. senior has already
rebounded from two earlier injuries
and is striving for his third straight
I00-yard game. Since the Notre
Dame game, when McCall played

an entire 60 minutes without alter-'

nating with freshman Chuck Scales,
he is living up to the preseason All:
East honors accorded him. « ‘
Though Dozier has come through
_in the big games with mega-yardage,
McCall has the massive offensive
line-in front of him and the impres-
sive performances against Florida
State and Notre Dame to vouch for
him. His 4.9 yards per carry aside,

experience and the line give McCall"

the edge, larger than most will
realize.

I FULLBACK

Pitt backfield - coach Andy
Urbanic has continually shoved his
muscled and well-proportioned peo-
ple, Marlon Mclntyre and Marc

Football Show. .
“The last three ' of four weeks,
[Radecic] has played the way he did

. last year,” Paterno said.

Paterno also said that his team
was ready to play its best game of the
season.

“We've had a tough season,"
Radecic said. “A lot of that has to do
with the offenses we’re playing. The
offenses are getting better and bet-
ter_. It causes us to come up with
defensive schemes that are very pre-
cise. The more precise that you
become, the greater chance that
there is for error. We’ve had a lot of
trouble eliminating the big play.
Teams have been able to catch us
and beat us for big plays.“

The Pitt game for the Penn Stat-
ers (7-4) is their biggest of the sea-
son. With a win, they could salvage a
mediocre season.

“This means almost the entire'sea-
son to us,” Radecic said. “I'm anx-
ious. Playing against the great
players that Pitt has brings out the
best in you.”

players back in the 1980 Big 33
game, the Pennsylvania high school
all-star game.

So, like many of the other Lions,
he knows the Pitt players personally,
as well as competitively.

His career on the field has been
successful, but equally successful
has been his performance in .the
classroom.

Radecic was named first-team
Academic All-America by virtue of
stellar linebacking play but more
importantly, by his 3.45 grade point
average. He is an architectural engi-
neering major.

Though there is apparent interest
in his abilities off the football field,
Radecic holds aspirations for a pro
football career.

“I would love to play pro foot-
ball,” he said. “I don’t know what
the NFL scouts think. To be able to
play that caliber_of football would
be something. I believe I’m capable
of it.”

With the track record of previous
Penn State linebackers to vouch for
him, there is an excellent chance that
his architectural desires could take a
breather.

statistically by Penn State’s Jon
Williams.

True, Bailey recorded Pitt’s first
I00-yard gain against Navy and now
has 405 after 73 rushes, but the con-
sistency found by playing each game
keeps him a notch belo’w‘Williams.
McIntyre has more carries (76) but
less yardage (384).

Meantime, Williams has amassed
542 yards on 106 runs, though most
of that came before he was switched
from tailback against Notre Dame.
From a blocking standpoint, Willi-
ams is a likely question mark, both
Mclntyre and Bailey unselfishly'per-
fecting the technique for McCall
and, on occasion, Scales.

So what emerges is similar to that

of quarterback. Pitt has the duo,

Penn State the individual. Between
Mclntyre, Williams and Bailey,

‘ there is another deadlock.

FLAN KER

The verdict ‘is in, the result of a
unanimous vote by the jury: All-
America Kenny Jackson gives Penn
State the deep threat, fly pattern,
post play, whatever that can radi-
cally swing the game’s momentum.
Though Jackson suffered through
some offweeks before the'Notre
Dame game in which he caught

seven passes for l0l yards, he is the
~ favorite feet down.

Bob Schilken: An unknown but smooth noseguard on Pitt’s
highly regarded defensive line.‘

Schilken Smooth  

continued from page seventeen

“At the beginning of the season, it
hurt us because we didn’t have the
game experience. But you can say
we’re not a young line now after
playing‘ all season long. We’ve come
through in every situation and that’s
what counts.”

Hopefully, that experience will
pay off, as the'Pa_nthers head into
tomorrow’s game against archrival
Penn State. Trying to look at it as
the next game on the schedule is the
key, but Schilken agrees this is no
ordinary game.

“This game is going to be a great
game, no matter what the records
are,” said Schilken “No doubt, itfll
be the best game of the season. Ev-
eryone is psyched. It’s great feeling.

“The Penn State game is different

. in that it's not hard to prepare your-

self. Just" knowing you’re going to
play Penn State gets you psyched.
You don’t have to force ‘yourself to
get psyched. But you don’t want to
psych yourself too much. We’re try-
ing to be laid back about it all.’ When
the game comes, the game comes,
and we’ll be prepared.” '

Schilken will see his first action
against the Nittany Lions in tomor-
row’s contest. As a freshman, he
backed up J.C. Pelusi and saw

limited action. This season Schilken -

has really come on as a fighter on the
Panther defensive line.

“I can see the improvements I
have made,” said Schilken. “I need
to keep improving because I still
have a long way to go. I’ve learned a
lot about how college football is
played over the last two years. It’s

much more intense and it takes a lot -

more time to prepare.”

Although the lone starter at his

middle guard position at the begin- .

ning of the season, Schilken now
finds himself sharing the duties with
a fellow sophomore, Dennis Atiyeh.
That could be a discouragement to
anyone, but Schilken is a team
player and he takes it in stride.
“The coaches feel alternating with
Dennis (Atiyeh) is the best_for the

team,” said Schilken. “I agree with 9

their decision._ There’s alwaysa fresh
lineman out there. When you get
tired, you know there’s someone
who can come in and take over for
you.”

A tough defense and outstanding
defensive linemen have become a
tradition at Pitt, but many of those
scrimmage battlers "go unnoticed. It
takes great athletes to keep up that
Panther tradition.

“In years before, we had standout
linemen,” said Schilken. “But I think
this year it's more team play. Eve-
ryone is sacrificing, making the
pla-ys. Most people don’t see it. But it
doesn’t effect me at all. I just go out
there and get the job done.”

.Schilken also gets the job done in

. the classroom. He was just named a

District Academic All-America and
is on the national ballot.

As a pre-med student, Schilken
says hismain objective at Pitt is to be
accepted into medical school, enjoy-
ing football on the way.

But first, Schilkenand his fellow
Panther teammates must look for-
ward to tomorrow’s p.m. kickoff
against a stubborn Nittany Lion
team. But like all‘ season long,
Schilken and the defensive line will
intimidate their foe, make the big
plays and be the heroes in the
trenches, even if it may be unsung.

 

 

continued from page eighteen
With his 26 receptions for 375

yards and. five TDs, Pitt has no

counterpart. The squad will dearly
miss Dwight Collins, a likely sideline
candidate who is” one TD (23), 58
yards (2173) and 10 receptions (124)
away from all-time Pitt records. His
severely sprained ankle will give
freshman Matt Stennett the starting
nod. But Stennett has not been a
major factor. this year, grabbing l0
passes for 94 yards. .

Now the school career yardage
leader with 1898 yards, Jackson bya
landslide.

SPLIT END

For all the attention Jackson has
been getting, Penn State’s Kevin
Baugh has benefited tremendously.
His 33 catches for 508 yards rank
him first in both departments. On an
equal note, Pitt’s Bill Wallace,
amidst the throes of Julius Dawkins’
shadow last year, also leads Panth-
ers in receiving yardage (27 for 457).

Baugh, tied with Jackson with five ‘

TDs, has not registered the‘ big game
this year but provides Paterno with a
hefty dose of consistency. Wallace,

also with five touchdowns, is slowly *

coming into his own after picking up
90 yards in the biggie against Notre
Dame. V _ ~ .
Going here with the experience
factor, Baugh latches on to the edge
over a less fleet-footed Wallace.

TIGHT END

Pitt has the blockers in Clint Wil-
son and Pat Schipani, but Penn
State has the receiver in Dean Dim-
idio. Dimidio, third on the team
with 310 yards, has 17 catches and
three TDs. Contrastingly, Wilson
and Schipani have 193 yards and 17
catches between them.

Since Pittis better known for its
offensive monsters and can be
slightly affected by lack of tight end
blocking, give Dimidio the edge
since Penn State will need all the
eligible receivers possible, should
Dozier be garaged.

INTERIOR LINE

Even if he had four munchkins 
playing beside him, how can one ' A A

all, it’s impossible to miss the 6-5,

the relatively youthful line cannot be
missed. When Fazio runs the back-
field off left tackle, four to six yards

' at least are assured.

Up the middle is another seasoned
veteran, Jim Sweeney (6-3, 250).
This is Sweeney‘s fourth Penn State
encounter. Need more be said? In
the guard slots are sophomore Barry
Pettyjohn, a regular on the right side
the last three games and Mike Dahl
or Mike Dorundo on the left. Both
can handle their responsibilities
after beset earlier by hamstring and
ankle injuries.

Penn State’s boast here are senior
Ron Heller (6-6, 254) and sopho-
more Todd Moules,(6-1,251), who is
known to possess’ a run—blocking
technique. In all, though, Penn State
is pretty much outclassed. Give
Fralic and Pitt the edge.

LINEBACKER AND
DEFENSIVE END

Making their 4-4 look like a 4_-_3 is
insider Scott Radecic, a senior, no, a
very big senior at 6-3, 238 lbs. In
becoming familiar with his new cap.-
taincy and carrying a good football
sense, Radecic has adjusted well

third overall with 69 tackles and

three sacks to his credit.

State’s sack-happy end is Steve
Sefter, who has 12 already, but these
two'Nittany Lion notables hardly
measure up to Pitt’s band of
marauders.

First off, Troy Benson and Caesar
Aldisert have never relinquished
their 1-2 vise-like_ hold on tackle
stats. Benson has a lead of six with
145 this week. It seems at least one of
them will always be there. Their
pass-coverage is equally impressive,

1 the two having six interceptions.’

Accompanying these two juniors
are towering Chris‘Doleman (6-6,
220) and fifth-year senior sack-
leader Al Wenglikowski (6-2, 220).
Wenglikowski’s 13 sacks make evi-
dent his ﬁerce pass-rush capability.
Doleman, as a dropend, can surprise
with the blitz or equally come
through in pass coverage.

No contest here, folks. Pitt inter-
cepts the edge.

INTERIOR LINE .

Penn State was hoping noseguard
Greg Gattuso would .improve_this_
year over last but has missed the
presence of Walker Lee Ashley, who
made him look good last year. In
fact,‘ if there’s anybody who can cut
through Pitt tomorrow‘, he seems
pretty shy over raising his hand. A
contender is missing.

Admittedly, Pitt’s candidates at
nose, the alternating duo of Dennis
Atiyeh and Bob Schilken, have not

i been overly surprising from their

three-point stances. The same can be
said of in-and-out tackles Bob Bucz-
kowski and Tim Quense. So while
these four, all sophomores except
Quense, reap the benefits of the
moose in tackle Bill Maas (6-4, 265),
an interesting ironv develops.

Maas will be double-teamed again
this weekend, as has been" the patt-
ern, while the youngsters on either
side of him gain collegiate experi-
ence. The edge could slide either way
here, but Pitt should attain it simply
because Penn State has no-name
people.

SECONDARY

_ So far, both schools have suffered
key losses. Only thing is, Penn State
suffered the larger of the two. Penn
State All-America‘ safety Mark
Robinson cracked the ﬁbula in his
right leg against Alabama, and with

his loss went Penn State’s defensive -

backﬁeld.
Though not solely attributable to

-the backﬁeld here,‘ Penn State has

given up an?‘ average of 429 yards per
game, including 250 through the air,
and has allowed nine opponents to
gain over 400 yards. Four teams
have gained over 300 yards through
this porous secondary.

The savior, if you will, is hero '

Harry Hamilton, who occupies a
position similar to safety. The 6-0,
l9l-lb. senior leads Penn State with
81 tackles but is hindered in ways by
an inexperienced corps of halfbacks
in Chris Sydnor and Mark Fruehan
and safety Mike Zordich.

Pitt’s loss is strong safety Ray
Weatherspoon, who sprained an
ankle in practice earlier this week.
Sophomore Bill Callahan, the sea-.
son starter against Tennessee, will
get his chance tomorrow. Otherwise,
Penn State is overmatched.

Free safety Tom Flynn and the
ever-inspiring Troy Hill at corner-
back (with three interceptions), both
seniors, ‘should make for interesting
confrontations with the Nittany
Lions’ barrage of eligible receivers.
On the right corner is a proliﬁc
defender in Melvin Dean, intercept-
ing two passes and breaking up 15 --
a Pitt best. As is easily discernible,
Pitt again wipes out the competition
here, though those Nit receivers
aren’t exactly pushovers. A

' KICKING

\

"The placekicking goes to Nick
Gancitano, a junior who is 16 of 20
on field goals and 31 of 33 on PATs.
For Pitt, previously injured Eric
Schubert was kicking 25-yard ﬁeld
goals earlier in the week and would

Viancourt has ‘already misseda .i if

PAT and a ﬁeld goal, and Everett

missed two of three FGs against Syr-, — 75:

acuse. Even if Schubert comes back,
Gancitano gets the edge here.-

Knocked-out kneecaps just don’t». ;

heal that fast. ’

The punters, George Reynolds j V
' and Pitt’s Tony Recchia, have ‘ ‘
offsettingstats here. Reynolds holds _-
the edge in average with--42.3 per

boot as compared to 41 for Recchia. .

But Recchia gets the ball inside the
20 more often. If you have to denote

an edge, the slight one goes to .5

Reynolds.

_ And now, the climactic ﬁnish to a.

blood-and-guts war-to-be. Partial-

maintains that he thinks she “will be
really up‘_‘ for the tournament.
A younger player with experience

- on last year’s championship team is

“defensive spark plug" Sally Gilles- '

pie, who started l0 of 12 of those
important matches. Although only a
5-4 sophomore, Gillespie is already a
team leader.

“Sally has a lot of responsibility
for motivating the team and keeping
everyone mentally sharp,” said Col-
lier. “Her intensity, maturity and
confidence have a very important
effect on the team.”

“We know we need to play well,”
Gillespie explained. “There’s a lot of
pressure, but I think we’ll be able to

handle it. We can’t take Georgetown

lightly; no team that we’ve defeated
twice is just going to lay down.”

Regina Reyes, a 5-7 sophomore
who played on the Puerto Rican
Junior National team and the
Superior League system, returned to

Pitt this fall as what Collier calls “the
most improved player, physically
and skill-wise,” since leaving in
April.

Collier observes that Reyes
returned in better shape and was hit-
ting stronger and had her strongest
performance at the Southern Div-
ision tournament of the Big East at
Seton hall six weeks ago.

Freshman Sue Hoover hails from
Class AA champ Richland High
School and is “a very effective colle-
giate spiker with a very good atti-
tude,” said Collier. At the West
Virginia Classic in mid-season,
Hoover was the only Pitt player
named to the all—tournament team,
selected over middle blockers Kohu-P
tiak and Carment Tapia.

Tapia, a_ 5-11 sophomore who is a
three-year veteran of the Puerto
Rican National Team, will
matched up with Lori De Rentiis of
Providence should Pitt meet the
Friars in the finals. DeRertiis was a

first-team Big East selection and is
Providence’s top spiker at 6-2.

‘‘I consider Carmen to be the
number one blocker in the confer-
ence, and she knows what it will take
for us to win the Big East. She knows
what is expected of her for us to
win,” Collier’ commented.

“I think it’s going to be tough,”
Tapia admitted. “We have a young
team, but this is good for our devel-
opment. Georgetown is not that big
an obstacle, but we’ll have to work
for it.” ' .

Collier often states that Norwin
graduate Kris .Wexell had a starting
job the minute she walked on Pitt’s
court. The 5-5 freshman is not only
the Lady Panthers’ server reception
specialist but the entire conference’s.

-“I feel very strongly that Kris is

_ the number one server and number

one serve receiver in the Big East,
and she has the statistics to prove it,”
Collier asserted. “She is a winner,
and we will need her serving, defense

_ and emotional composure to win.”

Rounding out the Pitt roster is
freshman walk-on Marcy Cotters.

The 5-ll, Quigley High School
alumnus is steadily improving and
maintains a positive attitude.

“Marcy has helped this year’s
team a lot by working hard and
doing what’s expected of her when

' she steps on the court for a match,”

stated Collier. “She has been stead-
ily improving, and "I am confident
that with an injury to either Ulana or
